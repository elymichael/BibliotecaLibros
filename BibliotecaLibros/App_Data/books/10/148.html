<br/>He had unconsciously dropped back into the phraseology of the<br/>first days of his compulsory greatness.<br/><br/>The shining pageant still went winding like a radiant and<br/>interminable serpent down the crooked lanes of the quaint old city,<br/>and through the huzzaing hosts; but still the King rode with bowed<br/>head and vacant eyes, seeing only his mother's face and that<br/>wounded look in it.<br/><br/>"Largess, largess!" &#160;The cry fell upon an unheeding<br/>ear.<br/><br/>"Long live Edward of England!" &#160;It seemed as if the earth<br/>shook with the explosion; but there was no response from the King.<br/>&#160;He heard it only as one hears the thunder of the surf when it<br/>is blown to the ear out of a great distance, for it was smothered<br/>under another sound which was still nearer, in his own breast, in<br/>his accusing conscience—a voice which kept repeating those shameful<br/>words, "I do not know you, woman!"<br/><br/>The words smote upon the King's soul as the strokes of a funeral<br/>bell smite upon the soul of a surviving friend when they remind him<br/>of secret treacheries suffered at his hands by him that is<br/>gone.<br/><br/>New glories were unfolded at every turning; new wonders, new<br/>marvels, sprang into view; the pent clamours of waiting batteries<br/>were released; new raptures poured from the throats of the waiting<br/>multitudes: &#160;but the King gave no sign, and the accusing voice<br/>that went moaning through his comfortless breast was all the sound<br/>he heard.<br/><br/>By-and-by the gladness in the faces of the populace changed a<br/>little, and became touched with a something like solicitude or<br/>anxiety: &#160;an abatement in the volume of the applause was<br/>observable too. &#160;The Lord Protector was quick to notice these<br/>things: &#160;he was as quick to detect the cause. &#160;He spurred<br/>to the King's side, bent low in his saddle, uncovered, and<br/>said—<br/><br/>"My liege, it is an ill time for dreaming. &#160;The people<br/>observe thy downcast head, thy clouded mien, and they take it for<br/>an omen. &#160;Be advised: &#160;unveil the sun of royalty, and let<br/>it shine upon these boding vapours, and disperse them. &#160;Lift<br/>up thy face, and smile upon the people."<br/><br/>So saying, the Duke scattered a handful of coins to right and<br/>left, then retired to his place. &#160;The mock King did<br/>mechanically as he had been bidden. &#160;His smile had no heart in<br/>it, but few eyes were near enough or sharp enough to detect that.<br/>&#160;The noddings of his plumed head as he saluted his subjects<br/>were full of grace and graciousness; the largess which he delivered<br/>from his hand was royally liberal: &#160;so the people's anxiety<br/>vanished, and the acclamations burst forth again in as mighty a<br/>volume as before.<br/><br/>Still once more, a little before the progress was ended, the<br/>Duke was obliged to ride forward, and make remonstrance. &#160;He<br/>whispered—<br/><br/>
