<br/>It was a fair region, dotted with cottages and orchards, and the<br/>road led through broad pasture lands whose receding expanses,<br/>marked with gentle elevations and depressions, suggested the<br/>swelling and subsiding undulations of the sea. &#160;In the<br/>afternoon the returning prodigal made constant deflections from his<br/>course to see if by ascending some hillock he might not pierce the<br/>distance and catch a glimpse of his home. &#160;At last he was<br/>successful, and cried out excitedly—<br/><br/>"There is the village, my Prince, and there is the Hall close<br/>by! You may see the towers from here; and that wood there—that is<br/>my father's park. Ah, NOW thou'lt know what state and grandeur be!<br/>A house with seventy rooms—think of that!—and seven and twenty<br/>servants! &#160;A brave lodging for such as we, is it not so?<br/>&#160;Come, let us speed—my impatience will not brook further<br/>delay."<br/><br/>All possible hurry was made; still, it was after three o'clock<br/>before the village was reached. &#160;The travellers scampered<br/>through it, Hendon's tongue going all the time. &#160;"Here is the<br/>church—covered with the same ivy—none gone, none added."<br/>&#160;"Yonder is the inn, the old Red Lion,—and yonder is the<br/>market-place." &#160;"Here is the Maypole, and here the<br/>pump—nothing is altered; nothing but the people, at any rate; ten<br/>years make a change in people; some of these I seem to know, but<br/>none know me." &#160;So his chat ran on. The end of the village was<br/>soon reached; then the travellers struck into a crooked, narrow<br/>road, walled in with tall hedges, and hurried briskly along it for<br/>half a mile, then passed into a vast flower garden through an<br/>imposing gateway, whose huge stone pillars bore sculptured armorial<br/>devices. &#160;A noble mansion was before them.<br/><br/>"Welcome to Hendon Hall, my King!" exclaimed Miles. &#160;"Ah,<br/>'tis a great day! &#160;My father and my brother, and the Lady<br/>Edith will be so mad with joy that they will have eyes and tongue<br/>for none but me in the first transports of the meeting, and so<br/>thou'lt seem but coldly welcomed—but mind it not; 'twill soon seem<br/>otherwise; for when I say thou art my ward, and tell them how<br/>costly is my love for thee, thou'lt see them take thee to their<br/>breasts for Miles Hendon's sake, and make their house and hearts<br/>thy home for ever after!"<br/><br/>The next moment Hendon sprang to the ground before the great<br/>door, helped the King down, then took him by the hand and rushed<br/>within. A few steps brought him to a spacious apartment; he<br/>entered, seated the King with more hurry than ceremony, then ran<br/>toward a young man who sat at a writing-table in front of a<br/>generous fire of logs.<br/><br/>"Embrace me, Hugh," he cried, "and say thou'rt glad I am come<br/>again! and call our father, for home is not home till I shall touch<br/>his hand, and see his face, and hear his voice once more!"<br/><br/>But Hugh only drew back, after betraying a momentary surprise,<br/>and bent a grave stare upon the intruder—a stare which indicated<br/>somewhat of offended dignity, at first, then changed, in response<br/>to some inward thought or purpose, to an expression of marvelling<br/>curiosity, mixed with a real or assumed compassion. &#160;Presently<br/>he said, in a mild voice—<br/><br/>"Thy wits seem touched, poor stranger; doubtless thou hast<br/>suffered privations and rude buffetings at the world's hands; thy<br/>looks and dress betoken it. &#160;Whom dost thou take me to<br/>be?"<br/><br/>"Take thee? &#160;Prithee for whom else than whom thou art?<br/>&#160;I take thee to be Hugh Hendon," said Miles, sharply.<br/><br/>The other continued, in the same soft tone—<br/><br/>
