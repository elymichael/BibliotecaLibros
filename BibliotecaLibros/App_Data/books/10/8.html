<br/>Tom could always find something going on around the Maypole in<br/>Cheapside, and at the fairs; and now and then he and the rest of<br/>London had a chance to see a military parade when some famous<br/>unfortunate was carried prisoner to the Tower, by land or boat. One<br/>summer's day he saw poor Anne Askew and three men burned at the<br/>stake in Smithfield, and heard an ex- Bishop preach a sermon to<br/>them which did not interest him. &#160;Yes, Tom's life was varied<br/>and pleasant enough, on the whole.<br/><br/>By-and-by Tom's reading and dreaming about princely life wrought<br/>such a strong effect upon him that he began to ACT the prince,<br/>unconsciously. His speech and manners became curiously ceremonious<br/>and courtly, to the vast admiration and amusement of his intimates.<br/>&#160;But Tom's influence among these young people began to grow<br/>now, day by day; and in time he came to be looked up to, by them,<br/>with a sort of wondering awe, as a superior being. &#160;He seemed<br/>to know so much! and he could do and say such marvellous things!<br/>and withal, he was so deep and wise! &#160;Tom's remarks, and Tom's<br/>performances, were reported by the boys to their elders; and these,<br/>also, presently began to discuss Tom Canty, and to regard him as a<br/>most gifted and extraordinary creature. &#160;Full-grown people<br/>brought their perplexities to Tom for solution, and were often<br/>astonished at the wit and wisdom of his decisions. &#160;In fact he<br/>was become a hero to all who knew him except his own family—these,<br/>only, saw nothing in him.<br/><br/>Privately, after a while, Tom organised a royal court! &#160;He<br/>was the prince; his special comrades were guards, chamberlains,<br/>equerries, lords and ladies in waiting, and the royal family.<br/>&#160;Daily the mock prince was received with elaborate ceremonials<br/>borrowed by Tom from his romantic readings; daily the great affairs<br/>of the mimic kingdom were discussed in the royal council, and daily<br/>his mimic highness issued decrees to his imaginary armies, navies,<br/>and viceroyalties.<br/><br/>After which, he would go forth in his rags and beg a few<br/>farthings, eat his poor crust, take his customary cuffs and abuse,<br/>and then stretch himself upon his handful of foul straw, and resume<br/>his empty grandeurs in his dreams.<br/><br/>And still his desire to look just once upon a real prince, in<br/>the flesh, grew upon him, day by day, and week by week, until at<br/>last it absorbed all other desires, and became the one passion of<br/>his life.<br/><br/>One January day, on his usual begging tour, he tramped<br/>despondently up and down the region round about Mincing Lane and<br/>Little East Cheap, hour after hour, bare-footed and cold, looking<br/>in at cook-shop windows and longing for the dreadful pork-pies and<br/>other deadly inventions displayed there—for to him these were<br/>dainties fit for the angels; that is, judging by the smell, they<br/>were—for it had never been his good luck to own and eat one. There<br/>was a cold drizzle of rain; the atmosphere was murky; it was a<br/>melancholy day. &#160;At night Tom reached home so wet and tired<br/>and hungry that it was not possible for his father and grandmother<br/>to observe his forlorn condition and not be moved—after their<br/>fashion; wherefore they gave him a brisk cuffing at once and sent<br/>him to bed. &#160;For a long time his pain and hunger, and the<br/>swearing and fighting going on in the building, kept him awake; but<br/>at last his thoughts drifted away to far, romantic lands, and he<br/>fell asleep in the company of jewelled and gilded princelings who<br/>live in vast palaces, and had servants salaaming before them or<br/>flying to execute their orders. &#160;And then, as usual, he<br/>dreamed that HE was a princeling himself.<br/><br/>All night long the glories of his royal estate shone upon him;<br/>he moved among great lords and ladies, in a blaze of light,<br/>breathing perfumes, drinking in delicious music, and answering the<br/>reverent obeisances of the glittering throng as it parted to make<br/>way for him, with here a smile, and there a nod of his princely<br/>head.<br/><br/>And when he awoke in the morning and looked upon the<br/>wretchedness about him, his dream had had its usual effect—it had<br/>intensified the sordidness of his surroundings a thousandfold.<br/>&#160;Then came bitterness, and heart-break, and tears.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
