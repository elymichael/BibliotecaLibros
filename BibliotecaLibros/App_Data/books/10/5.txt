I will set down a tale as it was told to me by one who
had it of his father, which latter had it of HIS father, this last
having in like manner had it of HIS fatherâ€”and so on, back and
still back, three hundred years and more, the fathers transmitting
it to the sons and so preserving it. &#160;It may be history, it
may be only a legend, a tradition. It may have happened, it may not
have happened: &#160;but it COULD have happened. &#160;It may be
that the wise and the learned believed it in the old days; it may
be that only the unlearned and the simple loved it and credited
it.
