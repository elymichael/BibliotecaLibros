"What aileth thee?" asked a whisper near him. &#160;"Who art<br/>thou calling?"<br/><br/>"Sir William Herbert. &#160;Who art thou?"<br/><br/>"I? &#160;Who should I be, but thy sister Nan? &#160;Oh, Tom, I<br/>had forgot! Thou'rt mad yet—poor lad, thou'rt mad yet: &#160;would<br/>I had never woke to know it again! &#160;But prithee master thy<br/>tongue, lest we be all beaten till we die!"<br/><br/>The startled Prince sprang partly up, but a sharp reminder from<br/>his stiffened bruises brought him to himself, and he sank back<br/>among his foul straw with a moan and the ejaculation—<br/><br/>"Alas! it was no dream, then!"<br/><br/>In a moment all the heavy sorrow and misery which sleep had<br/>banished were upon him again, and he realised that he was no longer<br/>a petted prince in a palace, with the adoring eyes of a nation upon<br/>him, but a pauper, an outcast, clothed in rags, prisoner in a den<br/>fit only for beasts, and consorting with beggars and thieves.<br/><br/>In the midst of his grief he began to be conscious of hilarious<br/>noises and shoutings, apparently but a block or two away. &#160;The<br/>next moment there were several sharp raps at the door; John Canty<br/>ceased from snoring and said—<br/><br/>"Who knocketh? &#160;What wilt thou?"<br/><br/>A voice answered—<br/><br/>"Know'st thou who it was thou laid thy cudgel on?"<br/><br/>"No. &#160;Neither know I, nor care."<br/>
