<br/>"I am the Prince of Wales, my person is sacred; and thou shalt<br/>hang for laying thy hand upon me!"<br/><br/>The soldier brought his halberd to a present-arms and said<br/>mockingly—<br/><br/>"I salute your gracious Highness." &#160;Then angrily—"Be off,<br/>thou crazy rubbish!"<br/><br/>Here the jeering crowd closed round the poor little prince, and<br/>hustled him far down the road, hooting him, and shouting—<br/><br/>"Way for his Royal Highness! &#160;Way for the Prince of<br/>Wales!"<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
