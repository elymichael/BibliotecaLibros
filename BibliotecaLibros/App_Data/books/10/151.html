<br/>Now the robed and mitred great heads of the church, and their<br/>attendants, filed in upon the platform and took their appointed<br/>places; these were followed by the Lord Protector and other great<br/>officials, and these again by a steel-clad detachment of the<br/>Guard.<br/><br/>There was a waiting pause; then, at a signal, a triumphant peal<br/>of music burst forth, and Tom Canty, clothed in a long robe of<br/>cloth of gold, appeared at a door, and stepped upon the platform.<br/>&#160;The entire multitude rose, and the ceremony of the<br/>Recognition ensued.<br/><br/>Then a noble anthem swept the Abbey with its rich waves of<br/>sound; and thus heralded and welcomed, Tom Canty was conducted to<br/>the throne. &#160;The ancient ceremonies went on, with impressive<br/>solemnity, whilst the audience gazed; and as they drew nearer and<br/>nearer to completion, Tom Canty grew pale, and still paler, and a<br/>deep and steadily deepening woe and despondency settled down upon<br/>his spirits and upon his remorseful heart.<br/><br/>At last the final act was at hand. &#160;The Archbishop of<br/>Canterbury lifted up the crown of England from its cushion and held<br/>it out over the trembling mock-King's head. &#160;In the same<br/>instant a rainbow-radiance flashed along the spacious transept; for<br/>with one impulse every individual in the great concourse of nobles<br/>lifted a coronet and poised it over his or her head—and paused in<br/>that attitude.<br/><br/>A deep hush pervaded the Abbey. &#160;At this impressive moment,<br/>a startling apparition intruded upon the scene—an apparition<br/>observed by none in the absorbed multitude, until it suddenly<br/>appeared, moving up the great central aisle. &#160;It was a boy,<br/>bareheaded, ill shod, and clothed in coarse plebeian garments that<br/>were falling to rags. &#160;He raised his hand with a solemnity<br/>which ill comported with his soiled and sorry aspect, and delivered<br/>this note of warning—<br/><br/>"I forbid you to set the crown of England upon that forfeited<br/>head. &#160;I am the King!"<br/><br/>In an instant several indignant hands were laid upon the boy;<br/>but in the same instant Tom Canty, in his regal vestments, made a<br/>swift step forward, and cried out in a ringing voice—<br/><br/>"Loose him and forbear! &#160;He IS the King!"<br/><br/>A sort of panic of astonishment swept the assemblage, and they<br/>partly rose in their places and stared in a bewildered way at one<br/>another and at the chief figures in this scene, like persons who<br/>wondered whether they were awake and in their senses, or asleep and<br/>dreaming. &#160;The Lord Protector was as amazed as the rest, but<br/>quickly recovered himself, and exclaimed in a voice of<br/>authority—<br/><br/>"Mind not his Majesty, his malady is upon him again—seize the<br/>vagabond!"<br/><br/>
