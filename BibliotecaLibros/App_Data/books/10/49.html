<br/>'Space being made, presently entered a baron and an earl<br/>appareled after the Turkish fashion in long robes of bawdkin<br/>powdered with gold; hats on their heads of crimson velvet, with<br/>great rolls of gold, girded with two swords, called scimitars,<br/>hanging by great bawdricks of gold. &#160;Next came yet another<br/>baron and another earl, in two long gowns of yellow satin,<br/>traversed with white satin, and in every bend of white was a bend<br/>of crimson satin, after the fashion of Russia, with furred hats of<br/>gray on their heads; either of them having an hatchet in their<br/>hands, and boots with pykes' (points a foot long), 'turned up.<br/>&#160;And after them came a knight, then the Lord High Admiral, and<br/>with him five nobles, in doublets of crimson velvet, voyded low on<br/>the back and before to the cannell-bone, laced on the breasts with<br/>chains of silver; and over that, short cloaks of crimson satin, and<br/>on their heads hats after the dancers' fashion, with pheasants'<br/>feathers in them. &#160;These were appareled after the fashion of<br/>Prussia. &#160;The torchbearers, which were about an hundred, were<br/>appareled in crimson satin and green, like Moors, their faces<br/>black. Next came in a mommarye. Then the minstrels, which were<br/>disguised, danced; and the lords and ladies did wildly dance also,<br/>that it was a pleasure to behold.'<br/><br/>And while Tom, in his high seat, was gazing upon this 'wild'<br/>dancing, lost in admiration of the dazzling commingling of<br/>kaleidoscopic colours which the whirling turmoil of gaudy figures<br/>below him presented, the ragged but real little Prince of Wales was<br/>proclaiming his rights and his wrongs, denouncing the impostor, and<br/>clamouring for admission at the gates of Guildhall! The crowd<br/>enjoyed this episode prodigiously, and pressed forward and craned<br/>their necks to see the small rioter. Presently they began to taunt<br/>him and mock at him, purposely to goad him into a higher and still<br/>more entertaining fury. &#160;Tears of mortification sprang to his<br/>eyes, but he stood his ground and defied the mob right royally.<br/>&#160;Other taunts followed, added mockings stung him, and he<br/>exclaimed—<br/><br/>"I tell ye again, you pack of unmannerly curs, I am the Prince<br/>of Wales! And all forlorn and friendless as I be, with none to give<br/>me word of grace or help me in my need, yet will not I be driven<br/>from my ground, but will maintain it!"<br/><br/>"Though thou be prince or no prince, 'tis all one, thou be'st a<br/>gallant lad, and not friendless neither! &#160;Here stand I by thy<br/>side to prove it; and mind I tell thee thou might'st have a worser<br/>friend than Miles Hendon and yet not tire thy legs with seeking.<br/>Rest thy small jaw, my child; I talk the language of these base<br/>kennel-rats like to a very native."<br/><br/>The speaker was a sort of Don Caesar de Bazan in dress, aspect,<br/>and bearing. &#160;He was tall, trim-built, muscular. &#160;His<br/>doublet and trunks were of rich material, but faded and threadbare,<br/>and their gold-lace adornments were sadly tarnished; his ruff was<br/>rumpled and damaged; the plume in his slouched hat was broken and<br/>had a bedraggled and disreputable look; at his side he wore a long<br/>rapier in a rusty iron sheath; his swaggering carriage marked him<br/>at once as a ruffler of the camp. &#160;The speech of this<br/>fantastic figure was received with an explosion of jeers and<br/>laughter. &#160;Some cried, "'Tis another prince in disguise!"<br/>"'Ware thy tongue, friend: &#160;belike he is dangerous!"<br/>&#160;"Marry, he looketh it—mark his eye!" &#160;"Pluck the lad<br/>from him—to the horse-pond wi' the cub!"<br/><br/>Instantly a hand was laid upon the Prince, under the impulse of<br/>this happy thought; as instantly the stranger's long sword was out<br/>and the meddler went to the earth under a sounding thump with the<br/>flat of it. The next moment a score of voices shouted, "Kill the<br/>dog! &#160;Kill him! Kill him!" and the mob closed in on the<br/>warrior, who backed himself against a wall and began to lay about<br/>him with his long weapon like a madman. &#160;His victims sprawled<br/>this way and that, but the mob-tide poured over their prostrate<br/>forms and dashed itself against the champion with undiminished<br/>fury.<br/><br/>His moments seemed numbered, his destruction certain, when<br/>suddenly a trumpet-blast sounded, a voice shouted, "Way for the<br/>King's messenger!" and a troop of horsemen came charging down upon<br/>the mob, who fled out of harm's reach as fast as their legs could<br/>carry them. The bold stranger caught up the Prince in his arms, and<br/>was soon far away from danger and the multitude.<br/><br/>Return we within the Guildhall. &#160;Suddenly, high above the<br/>jubilant roar and thunder of the revel, broke the clear peal of a<br/>bugle-note. &#160;There was instant silence—a deep hush; then a<br/>single voice rose—that of the messenger from the palace—and began<br/>to pipe forth a proclamation, the whole multitude standing<br/>listening.<br/><br/>The closing words, solemnly pronounced, were—<br/><br/>"The King is dead!"<br/><br/>
