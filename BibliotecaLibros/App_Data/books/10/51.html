<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>12<br/>The Prince and his deliverer<br/><br/><br/>As soon as Miles Hendon and the little prince were clear of the<br/>mob, they struck down through back lanes and alleys toward the<br/>river. &#160;Their way was unobstructed until they approached<br/>London Bridge; then they ploughed into the multitude again, Hendon<br/>keeping a fast grip upon the Prince's—no, the King's—wrist.<br/>&#160;The tremendous news was already abroad, and the boy learned<br/>it from a thousand voices at once—"The King is dead!" &#160;The<br/>tidings struck a chill to the heart of the poor little waif, and<br/>sent a shudder through his frame. &#160;He realised the greatness<br/>of his loss, and was filled with a bitter grief; for the grim<br/>tyrant who had been such a terror to others had always been gentle<br/>with him. &#160;The tears sprang to his eyes and blurred all<br/>objects. &#160;For an instant he felt himself the most forlorn,<br/>outcast, and forsaken of God's creatures—then another cry shook the<br/>night with its far-reaching thunders: &#160;"Long live King Edward<br/>the Sixth!" and this made his eyes kindle, and thrilled him with<br/>pride to his fingers' ends. "Ah," he thought, "how grand and<br/>strange it seems—I AM KING!"<br/><br/>Our friends threaded their way slowly through the throngs upon<br/>the bridge. &#160;This structure, which had stood for six hundred<br/>years, and had been a noisy and populous thoroughfare all that<br/>time, was a curious affair, for a closely packed rank of stores and<br/>shops, with family quarters overhead, stretched along both sides of<br/>it, from one bank of the river to the other. &#160;The Bridge was a<br/>sort of town to itself; it had its inn, its beer-houses, its<br/>bakeries, its haberdasheries, its food markets, its manufacturing<br/>industries, and even its church. &#160;It looked upon the two<br/>neighbours which it linked together—London and Southwark—as being<br/>well enough as suburbs, but not otherwise particularly important.<br/>&#160;It was a close corporation, so to speak; it was a narrow<br/>town, of a single street a fifth of a mile long, its population was<br/>but a village population and everybody in it knew all his<br/>fellow-townsmen intimately, and had known their fathers and mothers<br/>before them—and all their little family affairs into the bargain.<br/>&#160;It had its aristocracy, of course—its fine old families of<br/>butchers, and bakers, and what-not, who had occupied the same old<br/>premises for five or six hundred years, and knew the great history<br/>of the Bridge from beginning to end, and all its strange legends;<br/>and who always talked bridgy talk, and thought bridgy thoughts, and<br/>lied in a long, level, direct, substantial bridgy way. &#160;It was<br/>just the sort of population to be narrow and ignorant and<br/>self-conceited. Children were born on the Bridge, were reared<br/>there, grew to old age, and finally died without ever having set a<br/>foot upon any part of the world but London Bridge alone. &#160;Such<br/>people would naturally imagine that the mighty and interminable<br/>procession which moved through its street night and day, with its<br/>confused roar of shouts and cries, its neighings and bellowing and<br/>bleatings and its muffled thunder-tramp, was the one great thing in<br/>this world, and themselves somehow the proprietors of it. &#160;And<br/>so they were, in effect—at least they could exhibit it from their<br/>windows, and did—for a consideration—whenever a returning king or<br/>hero gave it a fleeting splendour, for there was no place like it<br/>for affording a long, straight, uninterrupted view of marching<br/>columns.<br/><br/>Men born and reared upon the Bridge found life unendurably dull<br/>and inane elsewhere. &#160;History tells of one of these who left<br/>the Bridge at the age of seventy-one and retired to the country.<br/>&#160;But he could only fret and toss in his bed; he could not go<br/>to sleep, the deep stillness was so painful, so awful, so<br/>oppressive. &#160;When he was worn out with it, at last, he fled<br/>back to his old home, a lean and haggard spectre, and fell<br/>peacefully to rest and pleasant dreams under the lulling music of<br/>the lashing waters and the boom and crash and thunder of London<br/>Bridge.<br/><br/>In the times of which we are writing, the Bridge furnished<br/>'object lessons' in English history for its children—namely, the<br/>livid and decaying heads of renowned men impaled upon iron spikes<br/>atop of its gateways. &#160;But we digress.<br/><br/>Hendon's lodgings were in the little inn on the Bridge. &#160;As<br/>he neared the door with his small friend, a rough voice said—<br/><br/>"So, thou'rt come at last! &#160;Thou'lt not escape again, I<br/>warrant thee; and if pounding thy bones to a pudding can teach thee<br/>somewhat, thou'lt not keep us waiting another time, mayhap,"—and<br/>John Canty put out his hand to seize the boy.<br/><br/>Miles Hendon stepped in the way and said—<br/>
