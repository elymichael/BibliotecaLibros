<br/>[1]<br/><br/>It is<br/>most reasonable to regard the dress as copied from the costume of<br/>the citizens of London of that period, when long blue coats were<br/>the common habit of apprentices and serving-men, and yellow<br/>stockings were generally worn; the coat fits closely to the body,<br/>but has loose sleeves, and beneath is worn a sleeveless yellow<br/>under-coat; around the waist is a red leathern girdle; a clerical<br/>band around the neck, and a small flat black cap, about the size of<br/>a saucer, completes the costume.—Timbs' Curiosities of<br/>London.<br/><br/>[2]<br/><br/>It<br/>appears that Christ's Hospital was not originally founded as a<br/>SCHOOL; its object was to rescue children from the streets, to<br/>shelter, feed, clothe them.—Timbs' Curiosities of<br/>London.<br/><br/>[3]<br/><br/>The<br/>King was now approaching fast towards his end; and fearing lest<br/>Norfolk should escape him, he sent a message to the Commons, by<br/>which he desired them to hasten the Bill, on pretence that Norfolk<br/>enjoyed the dignity of Earl Marshal, and it was necessary to<br/>appoint another, who might officiate at the ensuing ceremony of<br/>installing his son Prince of Wales.—Hume's History of England, vol.<br/>iii. p. 307.<br/><br/>[4]<br/><br/>It was<br/>not till the end of this reign (Henry VIII.) that any salads,<br/>carrots, turnips, or other edible roots were produced in England.<br/>The little of these vegetables that was used was formerly imported<br/>from Holland and Flanders. Queen Catherine, when she wanted a<br/>salad, was obliged to despatch a messenger thither on<br/>purpose.—Hume's History of England, vol. iii. p. 314.<br/><br/>[5]<br/><br/>James<br/>I. and Charles II. had whipping-boys, when they were little<br/>fellows, to take their punishment for them when they fell short in<br/>their lessons; so I have ventured to furnish my small prince with<br/>one, for my own purposes.<br/><br/>
