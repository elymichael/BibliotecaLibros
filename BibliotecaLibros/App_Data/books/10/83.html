<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>17<br/>Foo-foo the First<br/><br/><br/>Miles Hendon hurried along toward the Southwark end of the<br/>bridge, keeping a sharp look-out for the persons he sought, and<br/>hoping and expecting to overtake them presently. &#160;He was<br/>disappointed in this, however. &#160;By asking questions, he was<br/>enabled to track them part of the way through Southwark; then all<br/>traces ceased, and he was perplexed as to how to proceed.<br/>&#160;Still, he continued his efforts as best he could during the<br/>rest of the day. &#160;Nightfall found him leg-weary,<br/>half-famished, and his desire as far from accomplishment as ever;<br/>so he supped at the Tabard Inn and went to bed, resolved to make an<br/>early start in the morning, and give the town an exhaustive search.<br/>&#160;As he lay thinking and planning, he presently began to reason<br/>thus: &#160;The boy would escape from the ruffian, his reputed<br/>father, if possible; would he go back to London and seek his former<br/>haunts? &#160;No, he would not do that, he would avoid recapture.<br/>What, then, would he do? &#160;Never having had a friend in the<br/>world, or a protector, until he met Miles Hendon, he would<br/>naturally try to find that friend again, provided the effort did<br/>not require him to go toward London and danger. &#160;He would<br/>strike for Hendon Hall, that is what he would do, for he knew<br/>Hendon was homeward bound and there he might expect to find him.<br/>&#160;Yes, the case was plain to Hendon—he must lose no more time<br/>in Southwark, but move at once through Kent, toward Monk's Holm,<br/>searching the wood and inquiring as he went. &#160;Let us return to<br/>the vanished little King now.<br/><br/>The ruffian whom the waiter at the inn on the bridge saw 'about<br/>to join' the youth and the King did not exactly join them, but fell<br/>in close behind them and followed their steps. &#160;He said<br/>nothing. His left arm was in a sling, and he wore a large green<br/>patch over his left eye; he limped slightly, and used an oaken<br/>staff as a support. &#160;The youth led the King a crooked course<br/>through Southwark, and by-and-by struck into the high road beyond.<br/>&#160;The King was irritated, now, and said he would stop here—it<br/>was Hendon's place to come to him, not his to go to Hendon.<br/>&#160;He would not endure such insolence; he would stop where he<br/>was. &#160;The youth said—<br/><br/>"Thou'lt tarry here, and thy friend lying wounded in the wood<br/>yonder? &#160;So be it, then."<br/><br/>The King's manner changed at once. &#160;He cried out—<br/><br/>"Wounded? &#160;And who hath dared to do it? &#160;But that is<br/>apart; lead on, lead on! &#160;Faster, sirrah! &#160;Art shod with<br/>lead? &#160;Wounded, is he? &#160;Now though the doer of it be a<br/>duke's son he shall rue it!"<br/><br/>It was some distance to the wood, but the space was speedily<br/>traversed. The youth looked about him, discovered a bough sticking<br/>in the ground, with a small bit of rag tied to it, then led the way<br/>into the forest, watching for similar boughs and finding them at<br/>intervals; they were evidently guides to the point he was aiming<br/>at. &#160;By-and-by an open place was reached, where were the<br/>charred remains of a farm-house, and near them a barn which was<br/>falling to ruin and decay. &#160;There was no sign of life<br/>anywhere, and utter silence prevailed. &#160;The youth entered the<br/>barn, the King following eagerly upon his heels. &#160;No one<br/>there! The King shot a surprised and suspicious glance at the<br/>youth, and asked—<br/><br/>"Where is he?"<br/>
