The stunning surprise of this reply nailed the hag's feet to the
floor where she stood, and almost took her breath. &#160;She stared
at the Prince in stupid amazement, which so amused her ruffianly
son, that he burst into a roar of laughter. &#160;But the effect
upon Tom Canty's mother and sisters was different. &#160;Their
dread of bodily injury gave way at once to distress of a different
sort. &#160;They ran forward with woe and dismay in their faces,
exclaiming—

"Oh, poor Tom, poor lad!"

The mother fell on her knees before the Prince, put her hands
upon his shoulders, and gazed yearningly into his face through her
rising tears. Then she said—

"Oh, my poor boy! &#160;Thy foolish reading hath wrought its
woeful work at last, and ta'en thy wit away. &#160;Ah! why did'st
thou cleave to it when I so warned thee 'gainst it? &#160;Thou'st
broke thy mother's heart."

The Prince looked into her face, and said gently—

"Thy son is well, and hath not lost his wits, good dame.
&#160;Comfort thee: let me to the palace where he is, and
straightway will the King my father restore him to thee."

"The King thy father! &#160;Oh, my child! unsay these words that
be freighted with death for thee, and ruin for all that be near to
thee. &#160;Shake of this gruesome dream. &#160;Call back thy poor
wandering memory. &#160;Look upon me. Am not I thy mother that bore
thee, and loveth thee?"

The Prince shook his head and reluctantly said—

"God knoweth I am loth to grieve thy heart; but truly have I
never looked upon thy face before."

The woman sank back to a sitting posture on the floor, and,
covering her eyes with her hands, gave way to heart-broken sobs and
wailings.
