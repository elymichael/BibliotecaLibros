<br/>"Peace, my lord, thou utterest treason! &#160;Hast forgot the<br/>King's command? Remember I am party to thy crime if I but<br/>listen."<br/><br/>St. John paled, and hastened to say—<br/><br/>"I was in fault, I do confess it. &#160;Betray me not, grant me<br/>this grace out of thy courtesy, and I will neither think nor speak<br/>of this thing more. Deal not hardly with me, sir, else am I<br/>ruined."<br/><br/>"I am content, my lord. &#160;So thou offend not again, here or<br/>in the ears of others, it shall be as though thou hadst not spoken.<br/>&#160;But thou need'st not have misgivings. &#160;He is my sister's<br/>son; are not his voice, his face, his form, familiar to me from his<br/>cradle? Madness can do all the odd conflicting things thou seest in<br/>him, and more. &#160;Dost not recall how that the old Baron Marley,<br/>being mad, forgot the favour of his own countenance that he had<br/>known for sixty years, and held it was another's; nay, even claimed<br/>he was the son of Mary Magdalene, and that his head was made of<br/>Spanish glass; and, sooth to say, he suffered none to touch it,<br/>lest by mischance some heedless hand might shiver it? &#160;Give<br/>thy misgivings easement, good my lord. &#160;This is the very<br/>prince—I know him well—and soon will be thy king; it may advantage<br/>thee to bear this in mind, and more dwell upon it than the<br/>other."<br/><br/>After some further talk, in which the Lord St. John covered up<br/>his mistake as well as he could by repeated protests that his faith<br/>was thoroughly grounded now, and could not be assailed by doubts<br/>again, the Lord Hertford relieved his fellow-keeper, and sat down<br/>to keep watch and ward alone. &#160;He was soon deep in meditation,<br/>and evidently the longer he thought, the more he was bothered.<br/>&#160;By-and-by he began to pace the floor and mutter.<br/><br/>"Tush, he MUST be the prince! &#160;Will any be in all the land<br/>maintain there can be two, not of one blood and birth, so<br/>marvellously twinned? &#160;And even were it so, 'twere yet a<br/>stranger miracle that chance should cast the one into the other's<br/>place. Nay, 'tis folly, folly, folly!"<br/><br/>Presently he said—<br/><br/>"Now were he impostor and called himself prince, look you THAT<br/>would be natural; that would be reasonable. &#160;But lived ever an<br/>impostor yet, who, being called prince by the king, prince by the<br/>court, prince by all, DENIED his dignity and pleaded against his<br/>exaltation? &#160;NO! &#160;By the soul of St. Swithin, no!<br/>&#160;This is the true prince, gone mad!"<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
