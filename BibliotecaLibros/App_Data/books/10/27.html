<br/>"Take no thought of him, my prince: &#160;he is not worthy.<br/>&#160;Kiss me once again, and go to thy trifles and amusements; for<br/>my malady distresseth me. &#160;I am aweary, and would rest.<br/>&#160;Go with thine uncle Hertford and thy people, and come again<br/>when my body is refreshed."<br/><br/>Tom, heavy-hearted, was conducted from the presence, for this<br/>last sentence was a death-blow to the hope he had cherished that<br/>now he would be set free. &#160;Once more he heard the buzz of low<br/>voices exclaiming, "The prince, the prince comes!"<br/><br/>His spirits sank lower and lower as he moved between the<br/>glittering files of bowing courtiers; for he recognised that he was<br/>indeed a captive now, and might remain for ever shut up in this<br/>gilded cage, a forlorn and friendless prince, except God in his<br/>mercy take pity on him and set him free.<br/><br/>And, turn where he would, he seemed to see floating in the air<br/>the severed head and the remembered face of the great Duke of<br/>Norfolk, the eyes fixed on him reproachfully.<br/><br/>His old dreams had been so pleasant; but this reality was so<br/>dreary!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
