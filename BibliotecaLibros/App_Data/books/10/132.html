<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>27<br/>In prison<br/><br/><br/>The cells were all crowded; so the two friends were chained in a<br/>large room where persons charged with trifling offences were<br/>commonly kept. They had company, for there were some twenty<br/>manacled and fettered prisoners here, of both sexes and of varying<br/>ages,—an obscene and noisy gang. &#160;The King chafed bitterly<br/>over the stupendous indignity thus put upon his royalty, but Hendon<br/>was moody and taciturn. &#160;He was pretty thoroughly bewildered;<br/>he had come home, a jubilant prodigal, expecting to find everybody<br/>wild with joy over his return; and instead had got the cold<br/>shoulder and a jail. &#160;The promise and the fulfilment differed<br/>so widely that the effect was stunning; he could not decide whether<br/>it was most tragic or most grotesque. &#160;He felt much as a man<br/>might who had danced blithely out to enjoy a rainbow, and got<br/>struck by lightning.<br/><br/>But gradually his confused and tormenting thoughts settled down<br/>into some sort of order, and then his mind centred itself upon<br/>Edith. &#160;He turned her conduct over, and examined it in all<br/>lights, but he could not make anything satisfactory out of it.<br/>&#160;Did she know him—or didn't she know him? &#160;It was a<br/>perplexing puzzle, and occupied him a long time; but he ended,<br/>finally, with the conviction that she did know him, and had<br/>repudiated him for interested reasons. &#160;He wanted to load her<br/>name with curses now; but this name had so long been sacred to him<br/>that he found he could not bring his tongue to profane it.<br/><br/>Wrapped in prison blankets of a soiled and tattered condition,<br/>Hendon and the King passed a troubled night. &#160;For a bribe the<br/>jailer had furnished liquor to some of the prisoners; singing of<br/>ribald songs, fighting, shouting, and carousing was the natural<br/>consequence. &#160;At last, a while after midnight, a man attacked<br/>a woman and nearly killed her by beating her over the head with his<br/>manacles before the jailer could come to the rescue. &#160;The<br/>jailer restored peace by giving the man a sound clubbing about the<br/>head and shoulders—then the carousing ceased; and after that, all<br/>had an opportunity to sleep who did not mind the annoyance of the<br/>moanings and groanings of the two wounded people.<br/><br/>During the ensuing week, the days and nights were of a<br/>monotonous sameness as to events; men whose faces Hendon remembered<br/>more or less distinctly, came, by day, to gaze at the 'impostor'<br/>and repudiate and insult him; and by night the carousing and<br/>brawling went on with symmetrical regularity. &#160;However, there<br/>was a change of incident at last. The jailer brought in an old man,<br/>and said to him—<br/><br/>"The villain is in this room—cast thy old eyes about and see if<br/>thou canst say which is he."<br/><br/>Hendon glanced up, and experienced a pleasant sensation for the<br/>first time since he had been in the jail. &#160;He said to himself,<br/>"This is Blake Andrews, a servant all his life in my father's<br/>family—a good honest soul, with a right heart in his breast. That<br/>is, formerly. &#160;But none are true now; all are liars.<br/>&#160;This man will know me—and will deny me, too, like the<br/>rest."<br/><br/>The old man gazed around the room, glanced at each face in turn,<br/>and finally said—<br/>
