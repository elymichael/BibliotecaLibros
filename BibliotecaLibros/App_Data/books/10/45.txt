"What aileth thee?" asked a whisper near him. &#160;"Who art
thou calling?"

"Sir William Herbert. &#160;Who art thou?"

"I? &#160;Who should I be, but thy sister Nan? &#160;Oh, Tom, I
had forgot! Thou'rt mad yet—poor lad, thou'rt mad yet: &#160;would
I had never woke to know it again! &#160;But prithee master thy
tongue, lest we be all beaten till we die!"

The startled Prince sprang partly up, but a sharp reminder from
his stiffened bruises brought him to himself, and he sank back
among his foul straw with a moan and the ejaculation—

"Alas! it was no dream, then!"

In a moment all the heavy sorrow and misery which sleep had
banished were upon him again, and he realised that he was no longer
a petted prince in a palace, with the adoring eyes of a nation upon
him, but a pauper, an outcast, clothed in rags, prisoner in a den
fit only for beasts, and consorting with beggars and thieves.

In the midst of his grief he began to be conscious of hilarious
noises and shoutings, apparently but a block or two away. &#160;The
next moment there were several sharp raps at the door; John Canty
ceased from snoring and said—

"Who knocketh? &#160;What wilt thou?"

A voice answered—

"Know'st thou who it was thou laid thy cudgel on?"

"No. &#160;Neither know I, nor care."
