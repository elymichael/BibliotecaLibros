<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>16<br/>The State Dinner<br/><br/><br/>The dinner hour drew near—yet strangely enough, the thought<br/>brought but slight discomfort to Tom, and hardly any terror.<br/>&#160;The morning's experiences had wonderfully built up his<br/>confidence; the poor little ash-cat was already more wonted to his<br/>strange garret, after four days' habit, than a mature person could<br/>have become in a full month. &#160;A child's facility in<br/>accommodating itself to circumstances was never more strikingly<br/>illustrated.<br/><br/>Let us privileged ones hurry to the great banqueting-room and<br/>have a glance at matters there whilst Tom is being made ready for<br/>the imposing occasion. &#160;It is a spacious apartment, with<br/>gilded pillars and pilasters, and pictured walls and ceilings.<br/>&#160;At the door stand tall guards, as rigid as statues, dressed<br/>in rich and picturesque costumes, and bearing halberds. &#160;In a<br/>high gallery which runs all around the place is a band of musicians<br/>and a packed company of citizens of both sexes, in brilliant<br/>attire. &#160;In the centre of the room, upon a raised platform, is<br/>Tom's table. Now let the ancient chronicler speak:<br/><br/>"A gentleman enters the room bearing a rod, and along with him<br/>another bearing a tablecloth, which, after they have both kneeled<br/>three times with the utmost veneration, he spreads upon the table,<br/>and after kneeling again they both retire; then come two others,<br/>one with the rod again, the other with a salt-cellar, a plate, and<br/>bread; when they have kneeled as the others had done, and placed<br/>what was brought upon the table, they too retire with the same<br/>ceremonies performed by the first; at last come two nobles, richly<br/>clothed, one bearing a tasting-knife, who, after prostrating<br/>themselves three times in the most graceful manner, approach and<br/>rub the table with bread and salt, with as much awe as if the King<br/>had been present."<br/><br/>So end the solemn preliminaries. &#160;Now, far down the echoing<br/>corridors we hear a bugle-blast, and the indistinct cry, "Place for<br/>the King! &#160;Way for the King's most excellent majesty!"<br/>&#160;These sounds are momently repeated—they grow nearer and<br/>nearer—and presently, almost in our faces, the martial note peals<br/>and the cry rings out, "Way for the King!" &#160;At this instant<br/>the shining pageant appears, and files in at the door, with a<br/>measured march. Let the chronicler speak again:—<br/><br/>"First come Gentlemen, Barons, Earls, Knights of the Garter, all<br/>richly dressed and bareheaded; next comes the Chancellor, between<br/>two, one of which carries the royal sceptre, the other the Sword of<br/>State in a red scabbard, studded with golden fleurs-de-lis, the<br/>point upwards; next comes the King himself—whom, upon his<br/>appearing, twelve trumpets and many drums salute with a great burst<br/>of welcome, whilst all in the galleries rise in their places,<br/>crying 'God save the King!' &#160;After him come nobles attached to<br/>his person, and on his right and left march his guard of honour,<br/>his fifty Gentlemen Pensioners, with gilt battle-axes."<br/><br/>This was all fine and pleasant. &#160;Tom's pulse beat high, and<br/>a glad light was in his eye. &#160;He bore himself right<br/>gracefully, and all the more so because he was not thinking of how<br/>he was doing it, his mind being charmed and occupied with the<br/>blithe sights and sounds about him—and besides, nobody can be very<br/>ungraceful in nicely-fitting beautiful clothes after he has grown a<br/>little used to them—especially if he is for the moment unconscious<br/>of them. Tom remembered his instructions, and acknowledged his<br/>greeting with a slight inclination of his plumed head, and a<br/>courteous "I thank ye, my good people."<br/><br/>He seated himself at table, without removing his cap; and did it<br/>without the least embarrassment; for to eat with one's cap on was<br/>the one solitary royal custom upon which the kings and the Cantys<br/>met upon common ground, neither party having any advantage over the<br/>other in the matter of old familiarity with it. &#160;The pageant<br/>broke up and grouped itself picturesquely, and remained<br/>bareheaded.<br/>
