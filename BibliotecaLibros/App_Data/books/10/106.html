"O good sir, peradventure you mean the ragged regal vagrant that<br/>tarried here the night. &#160;If such as you take an interest in<br/>such as he, know, then, that I have sent him of an errand. &#160;He<br/>will be back anon."<br/><br/>"How soon? &#160;How soon? &#160;Come, waste not the time—cannot<br/>I overtake him? How soon will he be back?"<br/><br/>"Thou need'st not stir; he will return quickly."<br/><br/>"So be it, then. &#160;I will try to wait. &#160;But stop!—YOU<br/>sent him of an errand?—you! &#160;Verily this is a lie—he would not<br/>go. &#160;He would pull thy old beard, an' thou didst offer him<br/>such an insolence. Thou hast lied, friend; thou hast surely lied!<br/>&#160;He would not go for thee, nor for any man."<br/><br/>"For any MAN—no; haply not. &#160;But I am not a man."<br/><br/>"WHAT! &#160;Now o' God's name what art thou, then?"<br/><br/>"It is a secret—mark thou reveal it not. &#160;I am an<br/>archangel!"<br/><br/>There was a tremendous ejaculation from Miles Hendon—not<br/>altogether unprofane—followed by—<br/><br/>"This doth well and truly account for his complaisance!<br/>&#160;Right well I knew he would budge nor hand nor foot in the<br/>menial service of any mortal; but, lord, even a king must obey when<br/>an archangel gives the word o' command! &#160;Let me—'sh!<br/>&#160;What noise was that?"<br/><br/>All this while the little King had been yonder, alternately<br/>quaking with terror and trembling with hope; and all the while,<br/>too, he had thrown all the strength he could into his anguished<br/>moanings, constantly expecting them to reach Hendon's ear, but<br/>always realising, with bitterness, that they failed, or at least<br/>made no impression. &#160;So this last remark of his servant came<br/>as comes a reviving breath from fresh fields to the dying; and he<br/>exerted himself once more, and with all his energy, just as the<br/>hermit was saying—<br/><br/>"Noise? &#160;I heard only the wind."<br/>
