Tom's poor mother and sisters travelled the same road out of his
mind. At first he pined for them, sorrowed for them, longed to see
them, but later, the thought of their coming some day in their rags
and dirt, and betraying him with their kisses, and pulling him down
from his lofty place, and dragging him back to penury and
degradation and the slums, made him shudder. &#160;At last they
ceased to trouble his thoughts almost wholly. &#160;And he was
content, even glad: &#160;for, whenever their mournful and accusing
faces did rise before him now, they made him feel more despicable
than the worms that crawl.

At midnight of the 19th of February, Tom Canty was sinking to
sleep in his rich bed in the palace, guarded by his loyal vassals,
and surrounded by the pomps of royalty, a happy boy; for tomorrow
was the day appointed for his solemn crowning as King of England.
At that same hour, Edward, the true king, hungry and thirsty,
soiled and draggled, worn with travel, and clothed in rags and
shreds—his share of the results of the riot—was wedged in among a
crowd of people who were watching with deep interest certain
hurrying gangs of workmen who streamed in and out of Westminster
Abbey, busy as ants: &#160;they were making the last preparation
for the royal coronation.
