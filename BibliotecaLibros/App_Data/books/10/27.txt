"Take no thought of him, my prince: &#160;he is not worthy.
&#160;Kiss me once again, and go to thy trifles and amusements; for
my malady distresseth me. &#160;I am aweary, and would rest.
&#160;Go with thine uncle Hertford and thy people, and come again
when my body is refreshed."

Tom, heavy-hearted, was conducted from the presence, for this
last sentence was a death-blow to the hope he had cherished that
now he would be set free. &#160;Once more he heard the buzz of low
voices exclaiming, "The prince, the prince comes!"

His spirits sank lower and lower as he moved between the
glittering files of bowing courtiers; for he recognised that he was
indeed a captive now, and might remain for ever shut up in this
gilded cage, a forlorn and friendless prince, except God in his
mercy take pity on him and set him free.

And, turn where he would, he seemed to see floating in the air
the severed head and the remembered face of the great Duke of
Norfolk, the eyes fixed on him reproachfully.

His old dreams had been so pleasant; but this reality was so
dreary!
