<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>3<br/>Tom's meeting with the Prince<br/><br/><br/>Tom got up hungry, and sauntered hungry away, but with his<br/>thoughts busy with the shadowy splendours of his night's dreams. He<br/>wandered here and there in the city, hardly noticing where he was<br/>going, or what was happening around him. &#160;People jostled him,<br/>and some gave him rough speech; but it was all lost on the musing<br/>boy. &#160;By-and-by he found himself at Temple Bar, the farthest<br/>from home he had ever travelled in that direction. &#160;He stopped<br/>and considered a moment, then fell into his imaginings again, and<br/>passed on outside the walls of London. &#160;The Strand had ceased<br/>to be a country-road then, and regarded itself as a street, but by<br/>a strained construction; for, though there was a tolerably compact<br/>row of houses on one side of it, there were only some scattered<br/>great buildings on the other, these being palaces of rich nobles,<br/>with ample and beautiful grounds stretching to the river—grounds<br/>that are now closely packed with grim acres of brick and stone.<br/><br/>Tom discovered Charing Village presently, and rested himself at<br/>the beautiful cross built there by a bereaved king of earlier days;<br/>then idled down a quiet, lovely road, past the great cardinal's<br/>stately palace, toward a far more mighty and majestic palace<br/>beyond—Westminster. Tom stared in glad wonder at the vast pile of<br/>masonry, the wide-spreading wings, the frowning bastions and<br/>turrets, the huge stone gateway, with its gilded bars and its<br/>magnificent array of colossal granite lions, and other the signs<br/>and symbols of English royalty. &#160;Was the desire of his soul to<br/>be satisfied at last? &#160;Here, indeed, was a king's palace.<br/>&#160;Might he not hope to see a prince now—a prince of flesh and<br/>blood, if Heaven were willing?<br/><br/>At each side of the gilded gate stood a living statue—that is to<br/>say, an erect and stately and motionless man-at-arms, clad from<br/>head to heel in shining steel armour. &#160;At a respectful<br/>distance were many country folk, and people from the city, waiting<br/>for any chance glimpse of royalty that might offer. &#160;Splendid<br/>carriages, with splendid people in them and splendid servants<br/>outside, were arriving and departing by several other noble<br/>gateways that pierced the royal enclosure.<br/><br/>Poor little Tom, in his rags, approached, and was moving slowly<br/>and timidly past the sentinels, with a beating heart and a rising<br/>hope, when all at once he caught sight through the golden bars of a<br/>spectacle that almost made him shout for joy. &#160;Within was a<br/>comely boy, tanned and brown with sturdy outdoor sports and<br/>exercises, whose clothing was all of lovely silks and satins,<br/>shining with jewels; at his hip a little jewelled sword and dagger;<br/>dainty buskins on his feet, with red heels; and on his head a<br/>jaunty crimson cap, with drooping plumes fastened with a great<br/>sparkling gem. &#160;Several gorgeous gentlemen stood near—his<br/>servants, without a doubt. &#160;Oh! he was a prince—a prince, a<br/>living prince, a real prince—without the shadow of a question; and<br/>the prayer of the pauper-boy's heart was answered at last.<br/><br/>Tom's breath came quick and short with excitement, and his eyes<br/>grew big with wonder and delight. &#160;Everything gave way in his<br/>mind instantly to one desire: &#160;that was to get close to the<br/>prince, and have a good, devouring look at him. &#160;Before he<br/>knew what he was about, he had his face against the gate-bars.<br/>&#160;The next instant one of the soldiers snatched him rudely<br/>away, and sent him spinning among the gaping crowd of country gawks<br/>and London idlers. &#160;The soldier said,—<br/><br/>"Mind thy manners, thou young beggar!"<br/><br/>The crowd jeered and laughed; but the young prince sprang to the<br/>gate with his face flushed, and his eyes flashing with indignation,<br/>and cried out,—<br/>
