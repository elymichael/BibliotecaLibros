"Now speed ye after me with the rest, and cry 'Stop thief!' but
mind ye lead them astray!"

The next moment Hugo turned a corner and darted down a crooked
alley—and in another moment or two he lounged into view again,
looking innocent and indifferent, and took up a position behind a
post to watch results.

The insulted King threw the bundle on the ground; and the
blanket fell away from it just as the woman arrived, with an
augmenting crowd at her heels; she seized the King's wrist with one
hand, snatched up her bundle with the other, and began to pour out
a tirade of abuse upon the boy while he struggled, without success,
to free himself from her grip.

Hugo had seen enough—his enemy was captured and the law would
get him, now—so he slipped away, jubilant and chuckling, and wended
campwards, framing a judicious version of the matter to give to the
Ruffler's crew as he strode along.

The King continued to struggle in the woman's strong grasp, and
now and then cried out in vexation—

"Unhand me, thou foolish creature; it was not I that bereaved
thee of thy paltry goods."

The crowd closed around, threatening the King and calling him
names; a brawny blacksmith in leather apron, and sleeves rolled to
his elbows, made a reach for him, saying he would trounce him well,
for a lesson; but just then a long sword flashed in the air and
fell with convincing force upon the man's arm, flat side down, the
fantastic owner of it remarking pleasantly, at the same time—

"Marry, good souls, let us proceed gently, not with ill blood
and uncharitable words. &#160;This is matter for the law's
consideration, not private and unofficial handling. &#160;Loose thy
hold from the boy, goodwife."

The blacksmith averaged the stalwart soldier with a glance, then
went muttering away, rubbing his arm; the woman released the boy's
wrist reluctantly; the crowd eyed the stranger unlovingly, but
prudently closed their mouths. &#160;The King sprang to his
deliverer's side, with flushed cheeks and sparkling eyes,
exclaiming—

"Thou hast lagged sorely, but thou comest in good season, now,
Sir Miles; carve me this rabble to rags!"
