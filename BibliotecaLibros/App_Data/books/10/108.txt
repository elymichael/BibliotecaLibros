Then followed a confusion of kicks, cuffs, tramplings and
plungings, accompanied by a thunderous intermingling of volleyed
curses, and finally a bitter apostrophe to the mule, which must
have broken its spirit, for hostilities seemed to cease from that
moment.

With unutterable misery the fettered little King heard the
voices and footsteps fade away and die out. &#160;All hope forsook
him, now, for the moment, and a dull despair settled down upon his
heart. "My only friend is deceived and got rid of," he said; "the
hermit will return and—" &#160;He finished with a gasp; and at once
fell to struggling so frantically with his bonds again, that he
shook off the smothering sheepskin.

And now he heard the door open! &#160;The sound chilled him to
the marrow—already he seemed to feel the knife at his throat.
&#160;Horror made him close his eyes; horror made him open them
again—and before him stood John Canty and Hugo!

He would have said "Thank God!" if his jaws had been free.

A moment or two later his limbs were at liberty, and his
captors, each gripping him by an arm, were hurrying him with all
speed through the forest.
