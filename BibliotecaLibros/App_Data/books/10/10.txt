"How dar'st thou use a poor lad like that? &#160;How dar'st thou
use the King my father's meanest subject so? &#160;Open the gates,
and let him in!"

You should have seen that fickle crowd snatch off their hats
then. You should have heard them cheer, and shout, "Long live the
Prince of Wales!"

The soldiers presented arms with their halberds, opened the
gates, and presented again as the little Prince of Poverty passed
in, in his fluttering rags, to join hands with the Prince of
Limitless Plenty.

Edward Tudor said—

"Thou lookest tired and hungry: &#160;thou'st been treated ill.
&#160;Come with me."

Half a dozen attendants sprang forward to—I don't know what;
interfere, no doubt. &#160;But they were waved aside with a right
royal gesture, and they stopped stock still where they were, like
so many statues. &#160;Edward took Tom to a rich apartment in the
palace, which he called his cabinet. &#160;By his command a repast
was brought such as Tom had never encountered before except in
books. &#160;The prince, with princely delicacy and breeding, sent
away the servants, so that his humble guest might not be
embarrassed by their critical presence; then he sat near by, and
asked questions while Tom ate.

"What is thy name, lad?"

"Tom Canty, an' it please thee, sir."

"'Tis an odd one. &#160;Where dost live?"

"In the city, please thee, sir. &#160;Offal Court, out of
Pudding Lane."
