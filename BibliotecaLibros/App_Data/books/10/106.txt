"O good sir, peradventure you mean the ragged regal vagrant that
tarried here the night. &#160;If such as you take an interest in
such as he, know, then, that I have sent him of an errand. &#160;He
will be back anon."

"How soon? &#160;How soon? &#160;Come, waste not the time—cannot
I overtake him? How soon will he be back?"

"Thou need'st not stir; he will return quickly."

"So be it, then. &#160;I will try to wait. &#160;But stop!—YOU
sent him of an errand?—you! &#160;Verily this is a lie—he would not
go. &#160;He would pull thy old beard, an' thou didst offer him
such an insolence. Thou hast lied, friend; thou hast surely lied!
&#160;He would not go for thee, nor for any man."

"For any MAN—no; haply not. &#160;But I am not a man."

"WHAT! &#160;Now o' God's name what art thou, then?"

"It is a secret—mark thou reveal it not. &#160;I am an
archangel!"

There was a tremendous ejaculation from Miles Hendon—not
altogether unprofane—followed by—

"This doth well and truly account for his complaisance!
&#160;Right well I knew he would budge nor hand nor foot in the
menial service of any mortal; but, lord, even a king must obey when
an archangel gives the word o' command! &#160;Let me—'sh!
&#160;What noise was that?"

All this while the little King had been yonder, alternately
quaking with terror and trembling with hope; and all the while,
too, he had thrown all the strength he could into his anguished
moanings, constantly expecting them to reach Hendon's ear, but
always realising, with bitterness, that they failed, or at least
made no impression. &#160;So this last remark of his servant came
as comes a reviving breath from fresh fields to the dying; and he
exerted himself once more, and with all his energy, just as the
hermit was saying—

"Noise? &#160;I heard only the wind."
