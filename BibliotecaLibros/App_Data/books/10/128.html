<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>26<br/>Disowned<br/><br/><br/>The King sat musing a few moments, then looked up and said—<br/><br/>"'Tis strange—most strange. &#160;I cannot account for it."<br/><br/>"No, it is not strange, my liege. &#160;I know him, and this<br/>conduct is but natural. &#160;He was a rascal from his birth."<br/><br/>"Oh, I spake not of HIM, Sir Miles."<br/><br/>"Not of him? &#160;Then of what? &#160;What is it that is<br/>strange?"<br/><br/>"That the King is not missed."<br/><br/>"How? &#160;Which? &#160;I doubt I do not understand."<br/>
