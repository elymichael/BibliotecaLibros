"Thy fears stay thee. &#160;Be of good heart, thou shalt suffer<br/>no harm. &#160;Make a storm—it mattereth not how small a one—I<br/>require nought great or harmful, but indeed prefer the opposite—do<br/>this and thy life is spared—thou shalt go out free, with thy child,<br/>bearing the King's pardon, and safe from hurt or malice from any in<br/>the realm."<br/><br/>The woman prostrated herself, and protested, with tears, that<br/>she had no power to do the miracle, else she would gladly win her<br/>child's life alone, and be content to lose her own, if by obedience<br/>to the King's command so precious a grace might be acquired.<br/><br/>Tom urged—the woman still adhered to her declarations.<br/>&#160;Finally he said—<br/><br/>"I think the woman hath said true. &#160;An' MY mother were in<br/>her place and gifted with the devil's functions, she had not stayed<br/>a moment to call her storms and lay the whole land in ruins, if the<br/>saving of my forfeit life were the price she got! &#160;It is<br/>argument that other mothers are made in like mould. &#160;Thou art<br/>free, goodwife—thou and thy child—for I do think thee innocent.<br/>&#160;NOW thou'st nought to fear, being pardoned—pull off thy<br/>stockings!—an' thou canst make me a storm, thou shalt be rich!"<br/><br/>The redeemed creature was loud in her gratitude, and proceeded<br/>to obey, whilst Tom looked on with eager expectancy, a little<br/>marred by apprehension; the courtiers at the same time manifesting<br/>decided discomfort and uneasiness. &#160;The woman stripped her own<br/>feet and her little girl's also, and plainly did her best to reward<br/>the King's generosity with an earthquake, but it was all a failure<br/>and a disappointment. &#160;Tom sighed, and said—<br/><br/>"There, good soul, trouble thyself no further, thy power is<br/>departed out of thee. &#160;Go thy way in peace; and if it return<br/>to thee at any time, forget me not, but fetch me a storm."<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
