<br/>After a moment's thought, the servant said—<br/><br/>"When he came, none came with him; but now I remember me that as<br/>the two stepped into the throng of the Bridge, a ruffian-looking<br/>man plunged out from some near place; and just as he was joining<br/>them—"<br/><br/>"What THEN?—out with it!" thundered the impatient Hendon,<br/>interrupting.<br/><br/>"Just then the crowd lapped them up and closed them in, and I<br/>saw no more, being called by my master, who was in a rage because a<br/>joint that the scrivener had ordered was forgot, though I take all<br/>the saints to witness that to blame ME for that miscarriage were<br/>like holding the unborn babe to judgment for sins com—"<br/><br/>"Out of my sight, idiot! &#160;Thy prating drives me mad!<br/>&#160;Hold! Whither art flying? &#160;Canst not bide still an<br/>instant? &#160;Went they toward Southwark?"<br/><br/>"Even so, your worship—for, as I said before, as to that<br/>detestable joint, the babe unborn is no whit more blameless<br/>than—"<br/><br/>"Art here YET! &#160;And prating still! &#160;Vanish, lest I<br/>throttle thee!" The servitor vanished. &#160;Hendon followed after<br/>him, passed him, and plunged down the stairs two steps at a stride,<br/>muttering, "'Tis that scurvy villain that claimed he was his son.<br/>&#160;I have lost thee, my poor little mad master—it is a bitter<br/>thought—and I had come to love thee so! &#160;No! by book and bell,<br/>NOT lost! &#160;Not lost, for I will ransack the land till I find<br/>thee again. &#160;Poor child, yonder is his breakfast—and mine, but<br/>I have no hunger now; so, let the rats have it—speed, speed! that<br/>is the word!" &#160;As he wormed his swift way through the noisy<br/>multitudes upon the Bridge he several times said to<br/>himself—clinging to the thought as if it were a particularly<br/>pleasing one—"He grumbled, but he WENT—he went, yes, because he<br/>thought Miles Hendon asked it, sweet lad—he would ne'er have done<br/>it for another, I know it well."<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
