The prince's face flushed with anger, and his ready hand flew to
his hip, but there was nothing there. &#160;There was a storm of
laughter, and one boy said—

"Didst mark that? &#160;He fancied he had a sword—belike he is
the prince himself."

This sally brought more laughter. &#160;Poor Edward drew himself
up proudly and said—

"I am the prince; and it ill beseemeth you that feed upon the
king my father's bounty to use me so."

This was vastly enjoyed, as the laughter testified. &#160;The
youth who had first spoken, shouted to his comrades—

"Ho, swine, slaves, pensioners of his grace's princely father,
where be your manners? &#160;Down on your marrow bones, all of ye,
and do reverence to his kingly port and royal rags!"

With boisterous mirth they dropped upon their knees in a body
and did mock homage to their prey. &#160;The prince spurned the
nearest boy with his foot, and said fiercely—

"Take thou that, till the morrow come and I build thee a
gibbet!"

Ah, but this was not a joke—this was going beyond fun. &#160;The
laughter ceased on the instant, and fury took its place. &#160;A
dozen shouted—

"Hale him forth! &#160;To the horse-pond, to the horse-pond!
&#160;Where be the dogs? &#160;Ho, there, Lion! ho, Fangs!"
