When the woman was called upon to testify before the justice of
the peace, she swore that the small prisoner at the bar was the
person who had committed the theft; there was none able to show the
contrary, so the King stood convicted. &#160;The bundle was now
unrolled, and when the contents proved to be a plump little dressed
pig, the judge looked troubled, whilst Hendon turned pale, and his
body was thrilled with an electric shiver of dismay; but the King
remained unmoved, protected by his ignorance. &#160;The judge
meditated, during an ominous pause, then turned to the woman, with
the question—

"What dost thou hold this property to be worth?"

The woman courtesied and replied—

"Three shillings and eightpence, your worship—I could not abate
a penny and set forth the value honestly."

The justice glanced around uncomfortably upon the crowd, then
nodded to the constable, and said—

"Clear the court and close the doors."

It was done. &#160;None remained but the two officials, the
accused, the accuser, and Miles Hendon. &#160;This latter was rigid
and colourless, and on his forehead big drops of cold sweat
gathered, broke and blended together, and trickled down his face.
&#160;The judge turned to the woman again, and said, in a
compassionate voice—

"'Tis a poor ignorant lad, and mayhap was driven hard by hunger,
for these be grievous times for the unfortunate; mark you, he hath
not an evil face—but when hunger driveth—Good woman! dost know that
when one steals a thing above the value of thirteenpence ha'penny
the law saith he shall HANG for it?"

The little King started, wide-eyed with consternation, but
controlled himself and held his peace; but not so the woman.
&#160;She sprang to her feet, shaking with fright, and cried
out—

"Oh, good lack, what have I done! &#160;God-a-mercy, I would not
hang the poor thing for the whole world! &#160;Ah, save me from
this, your worship—what shall I do, what CAN I do?"
