Now to the sound of gay music the Yeomen of the Guard
entered,—"the tallest and mightiest men in England, they being
carefully selected in this regard"—but we will let the chronicler
tell about it:—

"The Yeomen of the Guard entered, bareheaded, clothed in
scarlet, with golden roses upon their backs; and these went and
came, bringing in each turn a course of dishes, served in plate.
&#160;These dishes were received by a gentleman in the same order
they were brought, and placed upon the table, while the taster gave
to each guard a mouthful to eat of the particular dish he had
brought, for fear of any poison."

Tom made a good dinner, notwithstanding he was conscious that
hundreds of eyes followed each morsel to his mouth and watched him
eat it with an interest which could not have been more intense if
it had been a deadly explosive and was expected to blow him up and
scatter him all about the place. &#160;He was careful not to hurry,
and equally careful not to do anything whatever for himself, but
wait till the proper official knelt down and did it for him.
&#160;He got through without a mistake—flawless and precious
triumph.

When the meal was over at last and he marched away in the midst
of his bright pageant, with the happy noises in his ears of blaring
bugles, rolling drums, and thundering acclamations, he felt that if
he had seen the worst of dining in public it was an ordeal which he
would be glad to endure several times a day if by that means he
could but buy himself free from some of the more formidable
requirements of his royal office.
