<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>22<br/>A<br/>victim of treachery<br/><br/><br/>Once more 'King Foo-foo the First' was roving with the tramps<br/>and outlaws, a butt for their coarse jests and dull-witted<br/>railleries, and sometimes the victim of small spitefulness at the<br/>hands of Canty and Hugo when the Ruffler's back was turned.<br/>&#160;None but Canty and Hugo really disliked him. &#160;Some of<br/>the others liked him, and all admired his pluck and spirit.<br/>&#160;During two or three days, Hugo, in whose ward and charge the<br/>King was, did what he covertly could to make the boy uncomfortable;<br/>and at night, during the customary orgies, he amused the company by<br/>putting small indignities upon him—always as if by accident.<br/>&#160;Twice he stepped upon the King's toes—accidentally—and the<br/>King, as became his royalty, was contemptuously unconscious of it<br/>and indifferent to it; but the third time Hugo entertained himself<br/>in that way, the King felled him to the ground with a cudgel, to<br/>the prodigious delight of the tribe. &#160;Hugo, consumed with<br/>anger and shame, sprang up, seized a cudgel, and came at his small<br/>adversary in a fury. &#160;Instantly a ring was formed around the<br/>gladiators, and the betting and cheering began.<br/><br/>But poor Hugo stood no chance whatever. &#160;His frantic and<br/>lubberly 'prentice-work found but a poor market for itself when<br/>pitted against an arm which had been trained by the first masters<br/>of Europe in single-stick, quarter-staff, and every art and trick<br/>of swordsmanship. &#160;The little King stood, alert but at<br/>graceful ease, and caught and turned aside the thick rain of blows<br/>with a facility and precision which set the motley on-lookers wild<br/>with admiration; and every now and then, when his practised eye<br/>detected an opening, and a lightning-swift rap upon Hugo's head<br/>followed as a result, the storm of cheers and laughter that swept<br/>the place was something wonderful to hear. &#160;At the end of<br/>fifteen minutes, Hugo, all battered, bruised, and the target for a<br/>pitiless bombardment of ridicule, slunk from the field; and the<br/>unscathed hero of the fight was seized and borne aloft upon the<br/>shoulders of the joyous rabble to the place of honour beside the<br/>Ruffler, where with vast ceremony he was crowned King of the<br/>Game-Cocks; his meaner title being at the same time solemnly<br/>cancelled and annulled, and a decree of banishment from the gang<br/>pronounced against any who should thenceforth utter it.<br/><br/>All attempts to make the King serviceable to the troop had<br/>failed. He had stubbornly refused to act; moreover, he was always<br/>trying to escape. &#160;He had been thrust into an unwatched<br/>kitchen, the first day of his return; he not only came forth<br/>empty-handed, but tried to rouse the housemates. He was sent out<br/>with a tinker to help him at his work; he would not work; moreover,<br/>he threatened the tinker with his own soldering-iron; and finally<br/>both Hugo and the tinker found their hands full with the mere<br/>matter of keeping his from getting away. &#160;He delivered the<br/>thunders of his royalty upon the heads of all who hampered his<br/>liberties or tried to force him to service. &#160;He was sent out,<br/>in Hugo's charge, in company with a slatternly woman and a diseased<br/>baby, to beg; but the result was not encouraging—he declined to<br/>plead for the mendicants, or be a party to their cause in any<br/>way.<br/><br/>Thus several days went by; and the miseries of this tramping<br/>life, and the weariness and sordidness and meanness and vulgarity<br/>of it, became gradually and steadily so intolerable to the captive<br/>that he began at last to feel that his release from the hermit's<br/>knife must prove only a temporary respite from death, at best.<br/><br/>But at night, in his dreams, these things were forgotten, and he<br/>was on his throne, and master again. &#160;This, of course,<br/>intensified the sufferings of the awakening—so the mortifications<br/>of each succeeding morning of the few that passed between his<br/>return to bondage and the combat with Hugo, grew bitterer and<br/>bitterer, and harder and harder to bear.<br/><br/>The morning after that combat, Hugo got up with a heart filled<br/>with vengeful purposes against the King. &#160;He had two plans, in<br/>particular. One was to inflict upon the lad what would be, to his<br/>proud spirit and 'imagined' royalty, a peculiar humiliation; and if<br/>he failed to accomplish this, his other plan was to put a crime of<br/>some kind upon the King, and then betray him into the implacable<br/>clutches of the law.<br/><br/>In pursuance of the first plan, he purposed to put a 'clime'<br/>upon the King's leg; rightly judging that that would mortify him to<br/>the last and perfect degree; and as soon as the clime should<br/>operate, he meant to get Canty's help, and FORCE the King to expose<br/>his leg in the highway and beg for alms. &#160;'Clime' was the cant<br/>term for a sore, artificially created. To make a clime, the<br/>operator made a paste or poultice of unslaked lime, soap, and the<br/>rust of old iron, and spread it upon a piece of leather, which was<br/>then bound tightly upon the leg. &#160;This would presently fret<br/>off the skin, and make the flesh raw and angry-looking; blood was<br/>then rubbed upon the limb, which, being fully dried, took on a dark<br/>and repulsive colour. &#160;Then a bandage of soiled rags was put<br/>on in a cleverly careless way which would allow the hideous ulcer<br/>to be seen, and move the compassion of the passer-by.<br/>
