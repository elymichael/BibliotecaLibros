Now the robed and mitred great heads of the church, and their
attendants, filed in upon the platform and took their appointed
places; these were followed by the Lord Protector and other great
officials, and these again by a steel-clad detachment of the
Guard.

There was a waiting pause; then, at a signal, a triumphant peal
of music burst forth, and Tom Canty, clothed in a long robe of
cloth of gold, appeared at a door, and stepped upon the platform.
&#160;The entire multitude rose, and the ceremony of the
Recognition ensued.

Then a noble anthem swept the Abbey with its rich waves of
sound; and thus heralded and welcomed, Tom Canty was conducted to
the throne. &#160;The ancient ceremonies went on, with impressive
solemnity, whilst the audience gazed; and as they drew nearer and
nearer to completion, Tom Canty grew pale, and still paler, and a
deep and steadily deepening woe and despondency settled down upon
his spirits and upon his remorseful heart.

At last the final act was at hand. &#160;The Archbishop of
Canterbury lifted up the crown of England from its cushion and held
it out over the trembling mock-King's head. &#160;In the same
instant a rainbow-radiance flashed along the spacious transept; for
with one impulse every individual in the great concourse of nobles
lifted a coronet and poised it over his or her head—and paused in
that attitude.

A deep hush pervaded the Abbey. &#160;At this impressive moment,
a startling apparition intruded upon the scene—an apparition
observed by none in the absorbed multitude, until it suddenly
appeared, moving up the great central aisle. &#160;It was a boy,
bareheaded, ill shod, and clothed in coarse plebeian garments that
were falling to rags. &#160;He raised his hand with a solemnity
which ill comported with his soiled and sorry aspect, and delivered
this note of warning—

"I forbid you to set the crown of England upon that forfeited
head. &#160;I am the King!"

In an instant several indignant hands were laid upon the boy;
but in the same instant Tom Canty, in his regal vestments, made a
swift step forward, and cried out in a ringing voice—

"Loose him and forbear! &#160;He IS the King!"

A sort of panic of astonishment swept the assemblage, and they
partly rose in their places and stared in a bewildered way at one
another and at the chief figures in this scene, like persons who
wondered whether they were awake and in their senses, or asleep and
dreaming. &#160;The Lord Protector was as amazed as the rest, but
quickly recovered himself, and exclaimed in a voice of
authority—

"Mind not his Majesty, his malady is upon him again—seize the
vagabond!"
