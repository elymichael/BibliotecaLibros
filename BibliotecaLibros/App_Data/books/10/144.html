<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>30<br/>Tom's progress<br/><br/><br/>Whilst the true King wandered about the land poorly clad, poorly<br/>fed, cuffed and derided by tramps one while, herding with thieves<br/>and murderers in a jail another, and called idiot and impostor by<br/>all impartially, the mock King Tom Canty enjoyed quite a different<br/>experience.<br/><br/>When we saw him last, royalty was just beginning to have a<br/>bright side for him. &#160;This bright side went on brightening<br/>more and more every day: in a very little while it was become<br/>almost all sunshine and delightfulness. &#160;He lost his fears;<br/>his misgivings faded out and died; his embarrassments departed, and<br/>gave place to an easy and confident bearing. &#160;He worked the<br/>whipping-boy mine to ever-increasing profit.<br/><br/>He ordered my Lady Elizabeth and my Lady Jane Grey into his<br/>presence when he wanted to play or talk, and dismissed them when he<br/>was done with them, with the air of one familiarly accustomed to<br/>such performances. &#160;It no longer confused him to have these<br/>lofty personages kiss his hand at parting.<br/><br/>He came to enjoy being conducted to bed in state at night, and<br/>dressed with intricate and solemn ceremony in the morning. &#160;It<br/>came to be a proud pleasure to march to dinner attended by a<br/>glittering procession of officers of state and gentlemen-at-arms;<br/>insomuch, indeed, that he doubled his guard of gentlemen-at-arms,<br/>and made them a hundred. &#160;He liked to hear the bugles sounding<br/>down the long corridors, and the distant voices responding, "Way<br/>for the King!"<br/><br/>He even learned to enjoy sitting in throned state in council,<br/>and seeming to be something more than the Lord Protector's<br/>mouthpiece. He liked to receive great ambassadors and their<br/>gorgeous trains, and listen to the affectionate messages they<br/>brought from illustrious monarchs who called him brother. &#160;O<br/>happy Tom Canty, late of Offal Court!<br/><br/>He enjoyed his splendid clothes, and ordered more: &#160;he<br/>found his four hundred servants too few for his proper grandeur,<br/>and trebled them. &#160;The adulation of salaaming courtiers came<br/>to be sweet music to his ears. &#160;He remained kind and gentle,<br/>and a sturdy and determined champion of all that were oppressed,<br/>and he made tireless war upon unjust laws: &#160;yet upon occasion,<br/>being offended, he could turn upon an earl, or even a duke, and<br/>give him a look that would make him tremble. &#160;Once, when his<br/>royal 'sister,' the grimly holy Lady Mary, set herself to reason<br/>with him against the wisdom of his course in pardoning so many<br/>people who would otherwise be jailed, or hanged, or burned, and<br/>reminded him that their august late father's prisons had sometimes<br/>contained as high as sixty thousand convicts at one time, and that<br/>during his admirable reign he had delivered seventy-two thousand<br/>thieves and robbers over to death by the executioner, the boy was<br/>filled with generous indignation, and commanded her to go to her<br/>closet, and beseech God to take away the stone that was in her<br/>breast, and give her a human heart.<br/><br/>Did Tom Canty never feel troubled about the poor little rightful<br/>prince who had treated him so kindly, and flown out with such hot<br/>zeal to avenge him upon the insolent sentinel at the palace-gate?<br/>Yes; his first royal days and nights were pretty well sprinkled<br/>with painful thoughts about the lost prince, and with sincere<br/>longings for his return, and happy restoration to his native rights<br/>and splendours. &#160;But as time wore on, and the prince did not<br/>come, Tom's mind became more and more occupied with his new and<br/>enchanting experiences, and by little and little the vanished<br/>monarch faded almost out of his thoughts; and finally, when he did<br/>intrude upon them at intervals, he was become an unwelcome spectre,<br/>for he made Tom feel guilty and ashamed.<br/>
