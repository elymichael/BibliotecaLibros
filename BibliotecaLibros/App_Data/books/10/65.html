<br/>Tom turned an inquiring look toward Hertford, who whispered—<br/><br/>"Your Majesty will signify consent. &#160;They come to testify<br/>their royal masters' sense of the heavy calamity which hath visited<br/>your Grace and the realm of England."<br/><br/>Tom did as he was bidden. &#160;Another secretary began to read<br/>a preamble concerning the expenses of the late King's household,<br/>which had amounted to 28,000 pounds during the preceding six<br/>months—a sum so vast that it made Tom Canty gasp; he gasped again<br/>when the fact appeared that 20,000 pounds of this money was still<br/>owing and unpaid; and once more when it appeared that the King's<br/>coffers were about empty, and his twelve hundred servants much<br/>embarrassed for lack of the wages due them. &#160;Tom spoke out,<br/>with lively apprehension—<br/><br/>"We be going to the dogs, 'tis plain. &#160;'Tis meet and<br/>necessary that we take a smaller house and set the servants at<br/>large, sith they be of no value but to make delay, and trouble one<br/>with offices that harass the spirit and shame the soul, they<br/>misbecoming any but a doll, that hath nor brains nor hands to help<br/>itself withal. &#160;I remember me of a small house that standeth<br/>over against the fish-market, by Billingsgate—"<br/><br/>A sharp pressure upon Tom's arm stopped his foolish tongue and<br/>sent a blush to his face; but no countenance there betrayed any<br/>sign that this strange speech had been remarked or given<br/>concern.<br/><br/>A secretary made report that forasmuch as the late King had<br/>provided in his will for conferring the ducal degree upon the Earl<br/>of Hertford and raising his brother, Sir Thomas Seymour, to the<br/>peerage, and likewise Hertford's son to an earldom, together with<br/>similar aggrandisements to other great servants of the Crown, the<br/>Council had resolved to hold a sitting on the 16th of February for<br/>the delivering and confirming of these honours, and that meantime,<br/>the late King not having granted, in writing, estates suitable to<br/>the support of these dignities, the Council, knowing his private<br/>wishes in that regard, had thought proper to grant to Seymour '500<br/>pound lands,' and to Hertford's son '800 pound lands, and 300 pound<br/>of the next bishop's lands which should fall vacant,'—his present<br/>Majesty being willing.<br/><br/>Tom was about to blurt out something about the propriety of<br/>paying the late King's debts first, before squandering all this<br/>money, but a timely touch upon his arm, from the thoughtful<br/>Hertford, saved him this indiscretion; wherefore he gave the royal<br/>assent, without spoken comment, but with much inward discomfort.<br/>&#160;While he sat reflecting a moment over the ease with which he<br/>was doing strange and glittering miracles, a happy thought shot<br/>into his mind: &#160;why not make his mother Duchess of Offal<br/>Court, and give her an estate? &#160;But a sorrowful thought swept<br/>it instantly away: he was only a king in name, these grave veterans<br/>and great nobles were his masters; to them his mother was only the<br/>creature of a diseased mind; they would simply listen to his<br/>project with unbelieving ears, then send for the doctor.<br/><br/>The dull work went tediously on. &#160;Petitions were read, and<br/>proclamations, patents, and all manner of wordy, repetitious, and<br/>wearisome papers relating to the public business; and at last Tom<br/>sighed pathetically and murmured to himself, "In what have I<br/>offended, that the good God should take me away from the fields and<br/>the free air and the sunshine, to shut me up here and make me a<br/>king and afflict me so?" &#160;Then his poor muddled head nodded a<br/>while and presently drooped to his shoulder; and the business of<br/>the empire came to a standstill for want of that august factor, the<br/>ratifying power. &#160;Silence ensued around the slumbering child,<br/>and the sages of the realm ceased from their deliberations.<br/><br/>During the forenoon, Tom had an enjoyable hour, by permission of<br/>his keepers, Hertford and St. John, with the Lady Elizabeth and the<br/>little Lady Jane Grey; though the spirits of the princesses were<br/>rather subdued by the mighty stroke that had fallen upon the royal<br/>house; and at the end of the visit his 'elder sister'—afterwards<br/>the 'Bloody Mary' of history—chilled him with a solemn interview<br/>which had but one merit in his eyes, its brevity. &#160;He had a<br/>few moments to himself, and then a slim lad of about twelve years<br/>of age was admitted to his presence, whose clothing, except his<br/>snowy ruff and the laces about his wrists, was of black,—doublet,<br/>hose, and all. &#160;He bore no badge of mourning but a knot of<br/>purple ribbon on his shoulder. &#160;He advanced hesitatingly, with<br/>head bowed and bare, and dropped upon one knee in front of Tom. Tom<br/>sat still and contemplated him soberly a moment. &#160;Then he<br/>said—<br/><br/>"Rise, lad. &#160;Who art thou. &#160;What wouldst have?"<br/><br/>
