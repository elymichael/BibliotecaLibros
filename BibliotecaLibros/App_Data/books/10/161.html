<br/>"Please you, sir, to follow me."<br/><br/>Hendon followed, saying to himself, "An' I were not travelling<br/>to death and judgment, and so must needs economise in sin, I would<br/>throttle this knave for his mock courtesy."<br/><br/>The two traversed a populous court, and arrived at the grand<br/>entrance of the palace, where the officer, with another bow,<br/>delivered Hendon into the hands of a gorgeous official, who<br/>received him with profound respect and led him forward through a<br/>great hall, lined on both sides with rows of splendid flunkeys (who<br/>made reverential obeisance as the two passed along, but fell into<br/>death-throes of silent laughter at our stately scarecrow the moment<br/>his back was turned), and up a broad staircase, among flocks of<br/>fine folk, and finally conducted him into a vast room, clove a<br/>passage for him through the assembled nobility of England, then<br/>made a bow, reminded him to take his hat off, and left him standing<br/>in the middle of the room, a mark for all eyes, for plenty of<br/>indignant frowns, and for a sufficiency of amused and derisive<br/>smiles.<br/><br/>Miles Hendon was entirely bewildered. &#160;There sat the young<br/>King, under a canopy of state, five steps away, with his head bent<br/>down and aside, speaking with a sort of human bird of paradise—a<br/>duke, maybe. &#160;Hendon observed to himself that it was hard<br/>enough to be sentenced to death in the full vigour of life, without<br/>having this peculiarly public humiliation added. &#160;He wished<br/>the King would hurry about it—some of the gaudy people near by were<br/>becoming pretty offensive. &#160;At this moment the King raised his<br/>head slightly, and Hendon caught a good view of his face. The sight<br/>nearly took his breath away!—He stood gazing at the fair young face<br/>like one transfixed; then presently ejaculated—<br/><br/>"Lo, the Lord of the Kingdom of Dreams and Shadows on his<br/>throne!"<br/><br/>He muttered some broken sentences, still gazing and marvelling;<br/>then turned his eyes around and about, scanning the gorgeous throng<br/>and the splendid saloon, murmuring, "But these are REAL—verily<br/>these are REAL—surely it is not a dream."<br/><br/>He stared at the King again—and thought, "IS it a dream&#160;…<br/>or IS he the veritable Sovereign of England, and not the friendless<br/>poor Tom o' Bedlam I took him for—who shall solve me this<br/>riddle?"<br/><br/>A sudden idea flashed in his eye, and he strode to the wall,<br/>gathered up a chair, brought it back, planted it on the floor, and<br/>sat down in it!<br/><br/>A buzz of indignation broke out, a rough hand was laid upon him<br/>and a voice exclaimed—<br/><br/>"Up, thou mannerless clown! would'st sit in the presence of the<br/>King?"<br/><br/>
