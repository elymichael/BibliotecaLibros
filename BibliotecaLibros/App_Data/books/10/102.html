This happy state of things continued while the two ate the<br/>supper; then, after a prayer before the shrine, the hermit put the<br/>boy to bed, in a small adjoining room, tucking him in as snugly and<br/>lovingly as a mother might; and so, with a parting caress, left him<br/>and sat down by the fire, and began to poke the brands about in an<br/>absent and aimless way. Presently he paused; then tapped his<br/>forehead several times with his fingers, as if trying to recall<br/>some thought which had escaped from his mind. &#160;Apparently he<br/>was unsuccessful. &#160;Now he started quickly up, and entered his<br/>guest's room, and said—<br/><br/>"Thou art King?"<br/><br/>"Yes," was the response, drowsily uttered.<br/><br/>"What King?"<br/><br/>"Of England."<br/><br/>"Of England? &#160;Then Henry is gone!"<br/><br/>"Alack, it is so. &#160;I am his son."<br/><br/>A black frown settled down upon the hermit's face, and he<br/>clenched his bony hands with a vindictive energy. &#160;He stood a<br/>few moments, breathing fast and swallowing repeatedly, then said in<br/>a husky voice—<br/><br/>"Dost know it was he that turned us out into the world houseless<br/>and homeless?"<br/><br/>There was no response. &#160;The old man bent down and scanned<br/>the boy's reposeful face and listened to his placid breathing.<br/>&#160;"He sleeps—sleeps soundly;" and the frown vanished away and<br/>gave place to an expression of evil satisfaction. &#160;A smile<br/>flitted across the dreaming boy's features. The hermit muttered,<br/>"So—his heart is happy;" and he turned away. &#160;He went<br/>stealthily about the place, seeking here and there for something;<br/>now and then halting to listen, now and then jerking his head<br/>around and casting a quick glance toward the bed; and always<br/>muttering, always mumbling to himself. &#160;At last he found what<br/>he seemed to want—a rusty old butcher knife and a whetstone.<br/>&#160;Then he crept to his place by the fire, sat himself down, and<br/>began to whet the knife softly on the stone, still muttering,<br/>mumbling, ejaculating. &#160;The winds sighed around the lonely<br/>place, the mysterious voices of the night floated by out of the<br/>distances. &#160;The shining eyes of venturesome mice and rats<br/>peered out at the old man from cracks and coverts, but he went on<br/>with his work, rapt, absorbed, and noted none of these things.<br/><br/>At long intervals he drew his thumb along the edge of his knife,<br/>and nodded his head with satisfaction. &#160;"It grows sharper," he<br/>said; "yes, it grows sharper."<br/>
