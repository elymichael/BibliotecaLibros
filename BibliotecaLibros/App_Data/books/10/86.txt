Conversation followed; not in the thieves' dialect of the song,
for that was only used in talk when unfriendly ears might be
listening. &#160;In the course of it, it appeared that 'John Hobbs'
was not altogether a new recruit, but had trained in the gang at
some former time. &#160;His later history was called for, and when
he said he had 'accidentally' killed a man, considerable
satisfaction was expressed; when he added that the man was a
priest, he was roundly applauded, and had to take a drink with
everybody. &#160;Old acquaintances welcomed him joyously, and new
ones were proud to shake him by the hand. &#160;He was asked why he
had 'tarried away so many months.' &#160;He answered—

"London is better than the country, and safer, these late years,
the laws be so bitter and so diligently enforced. &#160;An' I had
not had that accident, I had stayed there. &#160;I had resolved to
stay, and never more venture country-wards—but the accident has
ended that."

He inquired how many persons the gang numbered now. &#160;The
'ruffler,' or chief, answered—

"Five and twenty sturdy budges, bulks, files, clapperdogeons and
maunders, counting the dells and doxies and other morts. Most are
here, the rest are wandering eastward, along the winter lay. We
follow at dawn."

"I do not see the Wen among the honest folk about me.
&#160;Where may he be?"

"Poor lad, his diet is brimstone, now, and over hot for a
delicate taste. He was killed in a brawl, somewhere about
midsummer."

"I sorrow to hear that; the Wen was a capable man, and
brave."

"That was he, truly. &#160;Black Bess, his dell, is of us yet,
but absent on the eastward tramp; a fine lass, of nice ways and
orderly conduct, none ever seeing her drunk above four days in the
seven."

"She was ever strict—I remember it well—a goodly wench and
worthy all commendation. &#160;Her mother was more free and less
particular; a troublesome and ugly-tempered beldame, but furnished
with a wit above the common."

"We lost her through it. &#160;Her gift of palmistry and other
sorts of fortune-telling begot for her at last a witch's name and
fame. The law roasted her to death at a slow fire. &#160;It did
touch me to a sort of tenderness to see the gallant way she met her
lot—cursing and reviling all the crowd that gaped and gazed around
her, whilst the flames licked upward toward her face and catched
her thin locks and crackled about her old gray head—cursing them!
why an' thou should'st live a thousand years thoud'st never hear so
masterful a cursing. &#160;Alack, her art died with her.
&#160;There be base and weakling imitations left, but no true
blasphemy."
