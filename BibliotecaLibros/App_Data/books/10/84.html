<br/>A mocking laugh was his answer. &#160;The King was in a rage in<br/>a moment; he seized a billet of wood and was in the act of charging<br/>upon the youth when another mocking laugh fell upon his ear.<br/>&#160;It was from the lame ruffian who had been following at a<br/>distance. The King turned and said angrily—<br/><br/>"Who art thou? &#160;What is thy business here?"<br/><br/>"Leave thy foolery," said the man, "and quiet thyself. &#160;My<br/>disguise is none so good that thou canst pretend thou knowest not<br/>thy father through it."<br/><br/>"Thou art not my father. &#160;I know thee not. &#160;I am the<br/>King. &#160;If thou hast hid my servant, find him for me, or thou<br/>shalt sup sorrow for what thou hast done."<br/><br/>John Canty replied, in a stern and measured voice—<br/><br/>"It is plain thou art mad, and I am loath to punish thee;<br/>&#160;but if thou provoke me, I must. &#160;Thy prating doth no<br/>harm here, where there are no ears that need to mind thy follies;<br/>yet it is well to practise thy tongue to wary speech, that it may<br/>do no hurt when our quarters change. &#160;I have done a murder,<br/>and may not tarry at home—neither shalt thou, seeing I need thy<br/>service. &#160;My name is changed, for wise reasons; it is<br/>Hobbs—John Hobbs; thine is Jack—charge thy memory accordingly.<br/>&#160;Now, then, speak. &#160;Where is thy mother? &#160;Where are<br/>thy sisters? &#160;They came not to the place appointed—knowest<br/>thou whither they went?"<br/><br/>The King answered sullenly—<br/><br/>"Trouble me not with these riddles. &#160;My mother is dead; my<br/>sisters are in the palace."<br/><br/>The youth near by burst into a derisive laugh, and the King<br/>would have assaulted him, but Canty—or Hobbs, as he now called<br/>himself—prevented him, and said—<br/><br/>"Peace, Hugo, vex him not; his mind is astray, and thy ways fret<br/>him. Sit thee down, Jack, and quiet thyself; thou shalt have a<br/>morsel to eat, anon."<br/><br/>
