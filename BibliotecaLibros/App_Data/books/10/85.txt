Hobbs and Hugo fell to talking together, in low voices, and the
King removed himself as far as he could from their disagreeable
company. &#160;He withdrew into the twilight of the farther end of
the barn, where he found the earthen floor bedded a foot deep with
straw. &#160;He lay down here, drew straw over himself in lieu of
blankets, and was soon absorbed in thinking. &#160;He had many
griefs, but the minor ones were swept almost into forgetfulness by
the supreme one, the loss of his father. &#160;To the rest of the
world the name of Henry VIII. brought a shiver, and suggested an
ogre whose nostrils breathed destruction and whose hand dealt
scourgings and death; but to this boy the name brought only
sensations of pleasure; the figure it invoked wore a countenance
that was all gentleness and affection. &#160;He called to mind a
long succession of loving passages between his father and himself,
and dwelt fondly upon them, his unstinted tears attesting how deep
and real was the grief that possessed his heart. As the afternoon
wasted away, the lad, wearied with his troubles, sank gradually
into a tranquil and healing slumber.

After a considerable time—he could not tell how long—his senses
struggled to a half-consciousness, and as he lay with closed eyes
vaguely wondering where he was and what had been happening, he
noted a murmurous sound, the sullen beating of rain upon the roof.
A snug sense of comfort stole over him, which was rudely broken,
the next moment, by a chorus of piping cackles and coarse laughter.
&#160;It startled him disagreeably, and he unmuffled his head to
see whence this interruption proceeded. &#160;A grim and unsightly
picture met his eye. &#160;A bright fire was burning in the middle
of the floor, at the other end of the barn; and around it, and lit
weirdly up by the red glare, lolled and sprawled the motliest
company of tattered gutter-scum and ruffians, of both sexes, he had
ever read or dreamed of. &#160;There were huge stalwart men, brown
with exposure, long-haired, and clothed in fantastic rags; there
were middle-sized youths, of truculent countenance, and similarly
clad; there were blind mendicants, with patched or bandaged eyes;
crippled ones, with wooden legs and crutches; diseased ones, with
running sores peeping from ineffectual wrappings; there was a
villain-looking pedlar with his pack; a knife-grinder, a tinker,
and a barber-surgeon, with the implements of their trades; some of
the females were hardly-grown girls, some were at prime, some were
old and wrinkled hags, and all were loud, brazen, foul-mouthed; and
all soiled and slatternly; there were three sore-faced babies;
there were a couple of starveling curs, with strings about their
necks, whose office was to lead the blind.

The night was come, the gang had just finished feasting, an orgy
was beginning; the can of liquor was passing from mouth to mouth. A
general cry broke forth—

"A song! a song from the Bat and Dick and Dot-and-go-One!"

One of the blind men got up, and made ready by casting aside the
patches that sheltered his excellent eyes, and the pathetic placard
which recited the cause of his calamity. &#160;Dot-and-go-One
disencumbered himself of his timber leg and took his place, upon
sound and healthy limbs, beside his fellow-rascal; then they roared
out a rollicking ditty, and were reinforced by the whole crew, at
the end of each stanza, in a rousing chorus. &#160;By the time the
last stanza was reached, the half-drunken enthusiasm had risen to
such a pitch, that everybody joined in and sang it clear through
from the beginning, producing a volume of villainous sound that
made the rafters quake. &#160;These were the inspiring words:—


'Bien Darkman's then, Bouse Mort and Ken,
The bien Coves bings awast,
On Chates to trine by Rome Coves dine
For his long lib at last.
Bing'd out bien Morts and toure, and toure,
Bing out of the Rome vile bine,
And toure the Cove that cloy'd your duds,
Upon the Chates to trine.'

(From'The English Rogue.' London, 1665.)
