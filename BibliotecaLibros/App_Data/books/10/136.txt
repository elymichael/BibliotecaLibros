"Since the last day of January."

"And prithee who made him so?"

"Himself and the Great Council—with help of the King."

His Majesty started violently. &#160;"The KING!" he cried.
&#160;"WHAT king, good sir?"

"What king, indeed! (God-a-mercy, what aileth the boy?)
&#160;Sith we have but one, 'tis not difficult to answer—his most
sacred Majesty King Edward the Sixth—whom God preserve! &#160;Yea,
and a dear and gracious little urchin is he, too; and whether he be
mad or no—and they say he mendeth daily—his praises are on all
men's lips; and all bless him, likewise, and offer prayers that he
may be spared to reign long in England; for he began humanely with
saving the old Duke of Norfolk's life, and now is he bent on
destroying the cruellest of the laws that harry and oppress the
people."

This news struck his Majesty dumb with amazement, and plunged
him into so deep and dismal a reverie that he heard no more of the
old man's gossip. He wondered if the 'little urchin' was the
beggar-boy whom he left dressed in his own garments in the palace.
&#160;It did not seem possible that this could be, for surely his
manners and speech would betray him if he pretended to be the
Prince of Wales—then he would be driven out, and search made for
the true prince. &#160;Could it be that the Court had set up some
sprig of the nobility in his place? &#160;No, for his uncle would
not allow that—he was all-powerful and could and would crush such a
movement, of course. &#160;The boy's musings profited him nothing;
the more he tried to unriddle the mystery the more perplexed he
became, the more his head ached, and the worse he slept. &#160;His
impatience to get to London grew hourly, and his captivity became
almost unendurable.

Hendon's arts all failed with the King—he could not be
comforted; but a couple of women who were chained near him
succeeded better. Under their gentle ministrations he found peace
and learned a degree of patience. &#160;He was very grateful, and
came to love them dearly and to delight in the sweet and soothing
influence of their presence. &#160;He asked them why they were in
prison, and when they said they were Baptists, he smiled, and
inquired—

"Is that a crime to be shut up for in a prison? &#160;Now I
grieve, for I shall lose ye—they will not keep ye long for such a
little thing."

They did not answer; and something in their faces made him
uneasy. He said, eagerly—

"You do not speak; be good to me, and tell me—there will be no
other punishment? &#160;Prithee tell me there is no fear of
that."

They tried to change the topic, but his fears were aroused, and
he pursued it—
