"I am Edward, King of England."<br/><br/>A wild burst of laughter followed, partly of derision and partly<br/>of delight in the excellence of the joke. &#160;The King was stung.<br/>&#160;He said sharply—<br/><br/>"Ye mannerless vagrants, is this your recognition of the royal<br/>boon I have promised?"<br/><br/>He said more, with angry voice and excited gesture, but it was<br/>lost in a whirlwind of laughter and mocking exclamations.<br/>&#160;'John Hobbs' made several attempts to make himself heard<br/>above the din, and at last succeeded—saying—<br/><br/>"Mates, he is my son, a dreamer, a fool, and stark mad—mind him<br/>not—he thinketh he IS the King."<br/><br/>"I AM the King," said Edward, turning toward him, "as thou shalt<br/>know to thy cost, in good time. &#160;Thou hast confessed a<br/>murder—thou shalt swing for it."<br/><br/>"THOU'LT betray me?—THOU? &#160;An' I get my hands upon<br/>thee—"<br/><br/>"Tut-tut!" said the burley Ruffler, interposing in time to save<br/>the King, and emphasising this service by knocking Hobbs down with<br/>his fist, "hast respect for neither Kings NOR Rufflers? &#160;An'<br/>thou insult my presence so again, I'll hang thee up myself."<br/>&#160;Then he said to his Majesty, "Thou must make no threats<br/>against thy mates, lad; and thou must guard thy tongue from saying<br/>evil of them elsewhere. &#160;BE King, if it please thy mad humour,<br/>but be not harmful in it. &#160;Sink the title thou hast<br/>uttered—'tis treason; we be bad men in some few trifling ways, but<br/>none among us is so base as to be traitor to his King; we be loving<br/>and loyal hearts, in that regard. &#160;Note if I speak truth.<br/>&#160;Now—all together: &#160;'Long live Edward, King of<br/>England!'"<br/><br/>"LONG LIVE EDWARD, KING OF ENGLAND!"<br/><br/>The response came with such a thundergust from the motley crew<br/>that the crazy building vibrated to the sound. &#160;The little<br/>King's face lighted with pleasure for an instant, and he slightly<br/>inclined his head, and said with grave simplicity—<br/><br/>"I thank you, my good people."<br/>
