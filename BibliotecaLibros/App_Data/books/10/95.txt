The King was cordially ashamed of himself for having gotten all
that fright and misery out of so paltry a matter as a slumbering
calf; but he need not have felt so about it, for it was not the
calf that frightened him, but a dreadful non-existent something
which the calf stood for; and any other boy, in those old
superstitious times, would have acted and suffered just as he had
done.

The King was not only delighted to find that the creature was
only a calf, but delighted to have the calf's company; for he had
been feeling so lonesome and friendless that the company and
comradeship of even this humble animal were welcome. &#160;And he
had been so buffeted, so rudely entreated by his own kind, that it
was a real comfort to him to feel that he was at last in the
society of a fellow-creature that had at least a soft heart and a
gentle spirit, whatever loftier attributes might be lacking.
&#160;So he resolved to waive rank and make friends with the
calf.

While stroking its sleek warm back—for it lay near him and
within easy reach—it occurred to him that this calf might be
utilised in more ways than one. &#160;Whereupon he re-arranged his
bed, spreading it down close to the calf; then he cuddled himself
up to the calf's back, drew the covers up over himself and his
friend, and in a minute or two was as warm and comfortable as he
had ever been in the downy couches of the regal palace of
Westminster.

Pleasant thoughts came at once; life took on a cheerfuller
seeming. &#160;He was free of the bonds of servitude and crime,
free of the companionship of base and brutal outlaws; he was warm;
he was sheltered; in a word, he was happy. &#160;The night wind was
rising; it swept by in fitful gusts that made the old barn quake
and rattle, then its forces died down at intervals, and went
moaning and wailing around corners and projections—but it was all
music to the King, now that he was snug and comfortable: let it
blow and rage, let it batter and bang, let it moan and wail, he
minded it not, he only enjoyed it. &#160;He merely snuggled the
closer to his friend, in a luxury of warm contentment, and drifted
blissfully out of consciousness into a deep and dreamless sleep
that was full of serenity and peace. &#160;The distant dogs howled,
the melancholy kine complained, and the winds went on raging,
whilst furious sheets of rain drove along the roof; but the Majesty
of England slept on, undisturbed, and the calf did the same, it
being a simple creature, and not easily troubled by storms or
embarrassed by sleeping with a king.
