<br/>"Oh, hear him!" groaned Hugo, then privately ground his teeth.<br/>"He denies his own brother—and he with one foot in the grave!"<br/><br/>"Boy, thou art indeed hard of heart, if this is thy brother.<br/>&#160;For shame!—and he scarce able to move hand or foot. &#160;If<br/>he is not thy brother, who is he, then?"<br/><br/>"A beggar and a thief! &#160;He has got your money and has<br/>picked your pocket likewise. &#160;An' thou would'st do a healing<br/>miracle, lay thy staff over his shoulders and trust Providence for<br/>the rest."<br/><br/>But Hugo did not tarry for the miracle. &#160;In a moment he was<br/>up and off like the wind, the gentleman following after and raising<br/>the hue and cry lustily as he went. &#160;The King, breathing deep<br/>gratitude to Heaven for his own release, fled in the opposite<br/>direction, and did not slacken his pace until he was out of harm's<br/>reach. &#160;He took the first road that offered, and soon put the<br/>village behind him. &#160;He hurried along, as briskly as he could,<br/>during several hours, keeping a nervous watch over his shoulder for<br/>pursuit; but his fears left him at last, and a grateful sense of<br/>security took their place. &#160;He recognised, now, that he was<br/>hungry, and also very tired. &#160;So he halted at a farmhouse; but<br/>when he was about to speak, he was cut short and driven rudely<br/>away. &#160;His clothes were against him.<br/><br/>He wandered on, wounded and indignant, and was resolved to put<br/>himself in the way of like treatment no more. &#160;But hunger is<br/>pride's master; so, as the evening drew near, he made an attempt at<br/>another farmhouse; but here he fared worse than before; for he was<br/>called hard names and was promised arrest as a vagrant except he<br/>moved on promptly.<br/><br/>The night came on, chilly and overcast; and still the footsore<br/>monarch laboured slowly on. &#160;He was obliged to keep moving,<br/>for every time he sat down to rest he was soon penetrated to the<br/>bone with the cold. &#160;All his sensations and experiences, as he<br/>moved through the solemn gloom and the empty vastness of the night,<br/>were new and strange to him. &#160;At intervals he heard voices<br/>approach, pass by, and fade into silence; and as he saw nothing<br/>more of the bodies they belonged to than a sort of formless<br/>drifting blur, there was something spectral and uncanny about it<br/>all that made him shudder. &#160;Occasionally he caught the twinkle<br/>of a light—always far away, apparently—almost in another world; if<br/>he heard the tinkle of a sheep's bell, it was vague, distant,<br/>indistinct; the muffled lowing of the herds floated to him on the<br/>night wind in vanishing cadences, a mournful sound; now and then<br/>came the complaining howl of a dog over viewless expanses of field<br/>and forest; all sounds were remote; they made the little King feel<br/>that all life and activity were far removed from him, and that he<br/>stood solitary, companionless, in the centre of a measureless<br/>solitude.<br/><br/>He stumbled along, through the gruesome fascinations of this new<br/>experience, startled occasionally by the soft rustling of the dry<br/>leaves overhead, so like human whispers they seemed to sound; and<br/>by-and-by he came suddenly upon the freckled light of a tin lantern<br/>near at hand. &#160;He stepped back into the shadows and waited.<br/>&#160;The lantern stood by the open door of a barn. &#160;The King<br/>waited some time—there was no sound, and nobody stirring. &#160;He<br/>got so cold, standing still, and the hospitable barn looked so<br/>enticing, that at last he resolved to risk everything and enter. He<br/>started swiftly and stealthily, and just as he was crossing the<br/>threshold he heard voices behind him. &#160;He darted behind a<br/>cask, within the barn, and stooped down. &#160;Two farm-labourers<br/>came in, bringing the lantern with them, and fell to work, talking<br/>meanwhile. &#160;Whilst they moved about with the light, the King<br/>made good use of his eyes and took the bearings of what seemed to<br/>be a good-sized stall at the further end of the place, purposing to<br/>grope his way to it when he should be left to himself. &#160;He<br/>also noted the position of a pile of horse blankets, midway of the<br/>route, with the intent to levy upon them for the service of the<br/>crown of England for one night.<br/><br/>By-and-by the men finished and went away, fastening the door<br/>behind them and taking the lantern with them. &#160;The shivering<br/>King made for the blankets, with as good speed as the darkness<br/>would allow; gathered them up, and then groped his way safely to<br/>the stall. &#160;Of two of the blankets he made a bed, then covered<br/>himself with the remaining two. &#160;He was a glad monarch, now,<br/>though the blankets were old and thin, and not quite warm enough;<br/>and besides gave out a pungent horsey odour that was almost<br/>suffocatingly powerful.<br/><br/>Although the King was hungry and chilly, he was also so tired<br/>and so drowsy that these latter influences soon began to get the<br/>advantage of the former, and he presently dozed off into a state of<br/>semi-consciousness. &#160;Then, just as he was on the point of<br/>losing himself wholly, he distinctly felt something touch him!<br/>&#160;He was broad awake in a moment, and gasping for breath.<br/>&#160;The cold horror of that mysterious touch in the dark almost<br/>made his heart stand still. &#160;He lay motionless, and listened,<br/>scarcely breathing. But nothing stirred, and there was no sound.<br/>&#160;He continued to listen, and wait, during what seemed a long<br/>time, but still nothing stirred, and there was no sound. &#160;So<br/>he began to drop into a drowse once more, at last; and all at once<br/>he felt that mysterious touch again! &#160;It was a grisly thing,<br/>this light touch from this noiseless and invisible presence; it<br/>made the boy sick with ghostly fears. &#160;What should he do?<br/>&#160;That was the question; but he did not know how to answer it.<br/>&#160;Should he leave these reasonably comfortable quarters and fly<br/>from this inscrutable horror? &#160;But fly whither? &#160;He could<br/>not get out of the barn; and the idea of scurrying blindly hither<br/>and thither in the dark, within the captivity of the four walls,<br/>with this phantom gliding after him, and visiting him with that<br/>soft hideous touch upon cheek or shoulder at every turn, was<br/>intolerable. &#160;But to stay where he was, and endure this living<br/>death all night—was that better? &#160;No. &#160;What, then, was<br/>there left to do? &#160;Ah, there was but one course; he knew it<br/>well—he must put out his hand and find that thing!<br/><br/>It was easy to think this; but it was hard to brace himself up<br/>to try it. Three times he stretched his hand a little way out into<br/>the dark, gingerly; and snatched it suddenly back, with a gasp—not<br/>because it had encountered anything, but because he had felt so<br/>sure it was just GOING to. &#160;But the fourth time, he groped a<br/>little further, and his hand lightly swept against something soft<br/>and warm. &#160;This petrified him, nearly, with fright; his mind<br/>was in such a state that he could imagine the thing to be nothing<br/>else than a corpse, newly dead and still warm. He thought he would<br/>rather die than touch it again. &#160;But he thought this false<br/>thought because he did not know the immortal strength of human<br/>curiosity. In no long time his hand was tremblingly groping<br/>again—against his judgment, and without his consent—but groping<br/>persistently on, just the same. &#160;It encountered a bunch of<br/>long hair; he shuddered, but followed up the hair and found what<br/>seemed to be a warm rope; followed up the rope and found an<br/>innocent calf!—for the rope was not a rope at all, but the calf's<br/>tail.<br/><br/>
