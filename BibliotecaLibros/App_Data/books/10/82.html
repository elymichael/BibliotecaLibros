<br/>Now to the sound of gay music the Yeomen of the Guard<br/>entered,—"the tallest and mightiest men in England, they being<br/>carefully selected in this regard"—but we will let the chronicler<br/>tell about it:—<br/><br/>"The Yeomen of the Guard entered, bareheaded, clothed in<br/>scarlet, with golden roses upon their backs; and these went and<br/>came, bringing in each turn a course of dishes, served in plate.<br/>&#160;These dishes were received by a gentleman in the same order<br/>they were brought, and placed upon the table, while the taster gave<br/>to each guard a mouthful to eat of the particular dish he had<br/>brought, for fear of any poison."<br/><br/>Tom made a good dinner, notwithstanding he was conscious that<br/>hundreds of eyes followed each morsel to his mouth and watched him<br/>eat it with an interest which could not have been more intense if<br/>it had been a deadly explosive and was expected to blow him up and<br/>scatter him all about the place. &#160;He was careful not to hurry,<br/>and equally careful not to do anything whatever for himself, but<br/>wait till the proper official knelt down and did it for him.<br/>&#160;He got through without a mistake—flawless and precious<br/>triumph.<br/><br/>When the meal was over at last and he marched away in the midst<br/>of his bright pageant, with the happy noises in his ears of blaring<br/>bugles, rolling drums, and thundering acclamations, he felt that if<br/>he had seen the worst of dining in public it was an ordeal which he<br/>would be glad to endure several times a day if by that means he<br/>could but buy himself free from some of the more formidable<br/>requirements of his royal office.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
