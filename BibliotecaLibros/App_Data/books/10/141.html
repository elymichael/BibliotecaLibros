<br/>The King was seized. &#160;He did not even struggle, so<br/>paralysed was he with the mere thought of the monstrous outrage<br/>that was proposed to be inflicted upon his sacred person.<br/>&#160;History was already defiled with the record of the scourging<br/>of an English king with whips—it was an intolerable reflection that<br/>he must furnish a duplicate of that shameful page. &#160;He was in<br/>the toils, there was no help for him; he must either take this<br/>punishment or beg for its remission. &#160;Hard conditions; he<br/>would take the stripes—a king might do that, but a king could not<br/>beg.<br/><br/>But meantime, Miles Hendon was resolving the difficulty.<br/>&#160;"Let the child go," said he; "ye heartless dogs, do ye not<br/>see how young and frail he is? &#160;Let him go—I will take his<br/>lashes."<br/><br/>"Marry, a good thought—and thanks for it," said Sir Hugh, his<br/>face lighting with a sardonic satisfaction. &#160;"Let the little<br/>beggar go, and give this fellow a dozen in his place—an honest<br/>dozen, well laid on." The King was in the act of entering a fierce<br/>protest, but Sir Hugh silenced him with the potent remark, "Yes,<br/>speak up, do, and free thy mind—only, mark ye, that for each word<br/>you utter he shall get six strokes the more."<br/><br/>Hendon was removed from the stocks, and his back laid bare; and<br/>whilst the lash was applied the poor little King turned away his<br/>face and allowed unroyal tears to channel his cheeks unchecked.<br/>"Ah, brave good heart," he said to himself, "this loyal deed shall<br/>never perish out of my memory. &#160;I will not forget it—and<br/>neither shall THEY!" he added, with passion. &#160;Whilst he mused,<br/>his appreciation of Hendon's magnanimous conduct grew to greater<br/>and still greater dimensions in his mind, and so also did his<br/>gratefulness for it. &#160;Presently he said to himself, "Who saves<br/>his prince from wounds and possible death—and this he did for<br/>me—performs high service; but it is little—it is nothing—oh, less<br/>than nothing!—when 'tis weighed against the act of him who saves<br/>his prince from SHAME!"<br/><br/>Hendon made no outcry under the scourge, but bore the heavy<br/>blows with soldierly fortitude. &#160;This, together with his<br/>redeeming the boy by taking his stripes for him, compelled the<br/>respect of even that forlorn and degraded mob that was gathered<br/>there; and its gibes and hootings died away, and no sound remained<br/>but the sound of the falling blows. &#160;The stillness that<br/>pervaded the place, when Hendon found himself once more in the<br/>stocks, was in strong contrast with the insulting clamour which had<br/>prevailed there so little a while before. &#160;The King came<br/>softly to Hendon's side, and whispered in his ear—<br/><br/>"Kings cannot ennoble thee, thou good, great soul, for One who<br/>is higher than kings hath done that for thee; but a king can<br/>confirm thy nobility to men." &#160;He picked up the scourge from<br/>the ground, touched Hendon's bleeding shoulders lightly with it,<br/>and whispered, "Edward of England dubs thee Earl!"<br/><br/>Hendon was touched. &#160;The water welled to his eyes, yet at<br/>the same time the grisly humour of the situation and circumstances<br/>so undermined his gravity that it was all he could do to keep some<br/>sign of his inward mirth from showing outside. &#160;To be suddenly<br/>hoisted, naked and gory, from the common stocks to the Alpine<br/>altitude and splendour of an Earldom, seemed to him the last<br/>possibility in the line of the grotesque. &#160;He said to himself,<br/>"Now am I finely tinselled, indeed! &#160;The spectre-knight of the<br/>Kingdom of Dreams and Shadows is become a spectre-earl—a dizzy<br/>flight for a callow wing! &#160;An' this go on, I shall presently<br/>be hung like a very maypole with fantastic gauds and make-believe<br/>honours. &#160;But I shall value them, all valueless as they are,<br/>for the love that doth bestow them. Better these poor mock<br/>dignities of mine, that come unasked, from a clean hand and a right<br/>spirit, than real ones bought by servility from grudging and<br/>interested power."<br/><br/>The dreaded Sir Hugh wheeled his horse about, and as he spurred<br/>away, the living wall divided silently to let him pass, and as<br/>silently closed together again. &#160;And so remained; nobody went<br/>so far as to venture a remark in favour of the prisoner, or in<br/>compliment to him; but no matter—the absence of abuse was a<br/>sufficient homage in itself. &#160;A late comer who was not posted<br/>as to the present circumstances, and who delivered a sneer at the<br/>'impostor,' and was in the act of following it with a dead cat, was<br/>promptly knocked down and kicked out, without any words, and then<br/>the deep quiet resumed sway once more.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
