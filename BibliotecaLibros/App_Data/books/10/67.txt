"Whip THEE!" said Tom, astonished out of his presence of mind.
"Why should he whip THEE for faults of mine?"

"Ah, your Grace forgetteth again. &#160;He always scourgeth me
when thou dost fail in thy lessons."

"True, true—I had forgot. &#160;Thou teachest me in private—then
if I fail, he argueth that thy office was lamely done, and—"

"Oh, my liege, what words are these? &#160;I, the humblest of
thy servants, presume to teach THEE?"

"Then where is thy blame? &#160;What riddle is this? &#160;Am I
in truth gone mad, or is it thou? &#160;Explain—speak out."

"But, good your Majesty, there's nought that needeth
simplifying.—None may visit the sacred person of the Prince of
Wales with blows; wherefore, when he faulteth, 'tis I that take
them; and meet it is and right, for that it is mine office and my
livelihood."

Tom stared at the tranquil boy, observing to himself, "Lo, it is
a wonderful thing,—a most strange and curious trade; I marvel they
have not hired a boy to take my combings and my dressings for
me—would heaven they would!—an' they will do this thing, I will
take my lashings in mine own person, giving God thanks for the
change." Then he said aloud—

"And hast thou been beaten, poor friend, according to the
promise?"

"No, good your Majesty, my punishment was appointed for this
day, and peradventure it may be annulled, as unbefitting the season
of mourning that is come upon us; I know not, and so have made bold
to come hither and remind your Grace about your gracious promise to
intercede in my behalf—"

"With the master? &#160;To save thee thy whipping?"
