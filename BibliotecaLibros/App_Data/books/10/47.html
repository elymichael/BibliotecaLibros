"Sith that is thy humour, thou'lt NOT pass, till thou'st drunk<br/>to the Prince of Wales, I tell thee that," said the waterman,<br/>barring the way resolutely.<br/><br/>"Give me the cup, then, and make speed, make speed!"<br/><br/>Other revellers were interested by this time. &#160;They cried<br/>out—<br/><br/>"The loving-cup, the loving-cup! make the sour knave drink the<br/>loving-cup, else will we feed him to the fishes."<br/><br/>So a huge loving-cup was brought; the waterman, grasping it by<br/>one of its handles, and with the other hand bearing up the end of<br/>an imaginary napkin, presented it in due and ancient form to Canty,<br/>who had to grasp the opposite handle with one of his hands and take<br/>off the lid with the other, according to ancient custom. This left<br/>the Prince hand-free for a second, of course. &#160;He wasted no<br/>time, but dived among the forest of legs about him and disappeared.<br/>&#160;In another moment he could not have been harder to find,<br/>under that tossing sea of life, if its billows had been the<br/>Atlantic's and he a lost sixpence.<br/><br/>He very soon realised this fact, and straightway busied himself<br/>about his own affairs without further thought of John Canty.<br/>&#160;He quickly realised another thing, too. &#160;To wit, that a<br/>spurious Prince of Wales was being feasted by the city in his<br/>stead. &#160;He easily concluded that the pauper lad, Tom Canty,<br/>had deliberately taken advantage of his stupendous opportunity and<br/>become a usurper.<br/><br/>Therefore there was but one course to pursue—find his way to the<br/>Guildhall, make himself known, and denounce the impostor. &#160;He<br/>also made up his mind that Tom should be allowed a reasonable time<br/>for spiritual preparation, and then be hanged, drawn and quartered,<br/>according to the law and usage of the day in cases of high<br/>treason.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
