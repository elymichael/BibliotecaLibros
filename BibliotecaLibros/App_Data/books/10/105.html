<br/>The dawn was coming now; the hermit observed it, and spoke up<br/>sharply, with a touch of nervous apprehension in his voice—<br/><br/>"I may not indulge this ecstasy longer! &#160;The night is<br/>already gone. &#160;It seems but a moment—only a moment; would it<br/>had endured a year! &#160;Seed of the Church's spoiler, close thy<br/>perishing eyes, an' thou fearest to look upon—"<br/><br/>The rest was lost in inarticulate mutterings. &#160;The old man<br/>sank upon his knees, his knife in his hand, and bent himself over<br/>the moaning boy.<br/><br/>Hark! &#160;There was a sound of voices near the cabin—the knife<br/>dropped from the hermit's hand; he cast a sheepskin over the boy<br/>and started up, trembling. &#160;The sounds increased, and<br/>presently the voices became rough and angry; then came blows, and<br/>cries for help; then a clatter of swift footsteps, retreating.<br/>&#160;Immediately came a succession of thundering knocks upon the<br/>cabin door, followed by—<br/><br/>"Hullo-o-o! &#160;Open! &#160;And despatch, in the name of all<br/>the devils!"<br/><br/>Oh, this was the blessedest sound that had ever made music in<br/>the King's ears; for it was Miles Hendon's voice!<br/><br/>The hermit, grinding his teeth in impotent rage, moved swiftly<br/>out of the bedchamber, closing the door behind him; and straightway<br/>the King heard a talk, to this effect, proceeding from the<br/>'chapel':—<br/><br/>"Homage and greeting, reverend sir! &#160;Where is the boy—MY<br/>boy?"<br/><br/>"What boy, friend?"<br/><br/>"What boy! &#160;Lie me no lies, sir priest, play me no<br/>deceptions!—I am not in the humour for it. &#160;Near to this place<br/>I caught the scoundrels who I judged did steal him from me, and I<br/>made them confess; they said he was at large again, and they had<br/>tracked him to your door. &#160;They showed me his very footprints.<br/>&#160;Now palter no more; for look you, holy sir, an' thou produce<br/>him not—Where is the boy?"<br/><br/>
