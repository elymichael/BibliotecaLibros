"Let the show go on!" shouted Canty. &#160;"What, Nan!—what,
Bet! mannerless wenches! will ye stand in the Prince's presence?
&#160;Upon your knees, ye pauper scum, and do him reverence!"

He followed this with another horse-laugh. &#160;The girls began
to plead timidly for their brother; and Nan said—

"An thou wilt but let him to bed, father, rest and sleep will
heal his madness: &#160;prithee, do."

"Do, father," said Bet; "he is more worn than is his wont.
&#160;To-morrow will he be himself again, and will beg with
diligence, and come not empty home again."

This remark sobered the father's joviality, and brought his mind
to business. &#160;He turned angrily upon the Prince, and said—

"The morrow must we pay two pennies to him that owns this hole;
two pennies, mark ye—all this money for a half-year's rent, else
out of this we go. &#160;Show what thou'st gathered with thy lazy
begging."

The Prince said—

"Offend me not with thy sordid matters. &#160;I tell thee again
I am the King's son."

A sounding blow upon the Prince's shoulder from Canty's broad
palm sent him staggering into goodwife Canty's arms, who clasped
him to her breast, and sheltered him from a pelting rain of cuffs
and slaps by interposing her own person. &#160;The frightened girls
retreated to their corner; but the grandmother stepped eagerly
forward to assist her son. &#160;The Prince sprang away from Mrs.
Canty, exclaiming—

"Thou shalt not suffer for me, madam. &#160;Let these swine do
their will upon me alone."

This speech infuriated the swine to such a degree that they set
about their work without waste of time. &#160;Between them they
belaboured the boy right soundly, and then gave the girls and their
mother a beating for showing sympathy for the victim.
