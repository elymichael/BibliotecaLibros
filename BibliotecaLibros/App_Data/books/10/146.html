<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>31<br/>The Recognition procession<br/><br/><br/>When Tom Canty awoke the next morning, the air was heavy with a<br/>thunderous murmur: &#160;all the distances were charged with it.<br/>&#160;It was music to him; for it meant that the English world was<br/>out in its strength to give loyal welcome to the great day.<br/><br/>Presently Tom found himself once more the chief figure in a<br/>wonderful floating pageant on the Thames; for by ancient custom the<br/>'recognition procession' through London must start from the Tower,<br/>and he was bound thither.<br/><br/>When he arrived there, the sides of the venerable fortress<br/>seemed suddenly rent in a thousand places, and from every rent<br/>leaped a red tongue of flame and a white gush of smoke; a deafening<br/>explosion followed, which drowned the shoutings of the multitude,<br/>and made the ground tremble; the flame-jets, the smoke, and the<br/>explosions, were repeated over and over again with marvellous<br/>celerity, so that in a few moments the old Tower disappeared in the<br/>vast fog of its own smoke, all but the very top of the tall pile<br/>called the White Tower; this, with its banners, stood out above the<br/>dense bank of vapour as a mountain-peak projects above a<br/>cloud-rack.<br/><br/>Tom Canty, splendidly arrayed, mounted a prancing war-steed,<br/>whose rich trappings almost reached to the ground; his 'uncle,' the<br/>Lord Protector Somerset, similarly mounted, took place in his rear;<br/>the King's Guard formed in single ranks on either side, clad in<br/>burnished armour; after the Protector followed a seemingly<br/>interminable procession of resplendent nobles attended by their<br/>vassals; after these came the lord mayor and the aldermanic body,<br/>in crimson velvet robes, and with their gold chains across their<br/>breasts; and after these the officers and members of all the guilds<br/>of London, in rich raiment, and bearing the showy banners of the<br/>several corporations. &#160;Also in the procession, as a special<br/>guard of honour through the city, was the Ancient and Honourable<br/>Artillery Company—an organisation already three hundred years old<br/>at that time, and the only military body in England possessing the<br/>privilege (which it still possesses in our day) of holding itself<br/>independent of the commands of Parliament. &#160;It was a brilliant<br/>spectacle, and was hailed with acclamations all along the line, as<br/>it took its stately way through the packed multitudes of citizens.<br/>The chronicler says, 'The King, as he entered the city, was<br/>received by the people with prayers, welcomings, cries, and tender<br/>words, and all signs which argue an earnest love of subjects toward<br/>their sovereign; and the King, by holding up his glad countenance<br/>to such as stood afar off, and most tender language to those that<br/>stood nigh his Grace, showed himself no less thankful to receive<br/>the people's goodwill than they to offer it. &#160;To all that<br/>wished him well, he gave thanks. &#160;To such as bade "God save<br/>his Grace," he said in return, "God save you all!" and added that<br/>"he thanked them with all his heart." Wonderfully transported were<br/>the people with the loving answers and gestures of their King.'<br/><br/>In Fenchurch Street a 'fair child, in costly apparel,' stood on<br/>a stage to welcome his Majesty to the city. &#160;The last verse of<br/>his greeting was in these words—<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>
