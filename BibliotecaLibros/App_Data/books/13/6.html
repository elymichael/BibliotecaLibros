The intellectual slumber of the Middle Ages was destined to be<br/>awakened by the revolutionary doctrines of Copernicus. It may be<br/>noted, as an interesting circumstance, that the time at which he<br/>discovered the scheme of the solar system has coincided with a<br/>remarkable epoch in the world's history. The great astronomer had<br/>just reached manhood at the time when Columbus discovered the new<br/>world.<br/><br/>Before the publication of the researches of Copernicus, the<br/>orthodox scientific creed averred that the earth was stationary,<br/>and that the apparent movements of the heavenly bodies were indeed<br/>real movements. Ptolemy had laid down this doctrine 1,400 years<br/>before. In his theory this huge error was associated with so much<br/>important truth, and the whole presented such a coherent scheme for<br/>the explanation of the heavenly movements, that the Ptolemaic<br/>theory was not seriously questioned until the great work of<br/>Copernicus appeared. No doubt others, before Copernicus, had from<br/>time to time in some vague fashion surmised, with more or less<br/>plausibility, that the sun, and not the earth, was the centre about<br/>which the system really revolved. It is, however, one thing to<br/>state a scientific fact; it is quite another thing to be in<br/>possession of the train of reasoning, founded on observation or<br/>experiment, by which that fact may be established. Pythagoras, it<br/>appears, had indeed told his disciples that it was the sun, and not<br/>the earth, which was the centre of movement, but it does not seem<br/>at all certain that Pythagoras had any grounds which science could<br/>recognise for the belief which is attributed to him. So far as<br/>information is available to us, it would seem that Pythagoras<br/>associated his scheme of things celestial with a number of<br/>preposterous notions in natural philosophy. He may certainly have<br/>made a correct statement as to which was the most important body in<br/>the solar system, but he certainly did not provide any rational<br/>demonstration of the fact. Copernicus, by a strict train of<br/>reasoning, convinced those who would listen to him that the sun was<br/>the centre of the system. It is useful for us to consider the<br/>arguments which he urged, and by which he effected that<br/>intellectual revolution which is always connected with his<br/>name.<br/><br/>The first of the great discoveries which Copernicus made relates<br/>to the rotation of the earth on its axis. That general diurnal<br/>movement, by which the stars and all other celestial bodies appear<br/>to be carried completely round the heavens once every twenty-four<br/>hours, had been accounted for by Ptolemy on the supposition that<br/>the apparent movements were the real movements. As we have already<br/>seen, Ptolemy himself felt the extraordinary difficulty involved in<br/>the supposition that so stupendous a fabric as the celestial sphere<br/>should spin in the way supposed. Such movements required that many<br/>of the stars should travel with almost inconceivable velocity.<br/>Copernicus also saw that the daily rising and setting of the<br/>heavenly bodies could be accounted for either by the supposition<br/>that the celestial sphere moved round and that the earth remained<br/>at rest, or by the supposition that the celestial sphere was at<br/>rest while the earth turned round in the opposite direction. He<br/>weighed the arguments on both sides as Ptolemy had done, and, as<br/>the result of his deliberations, Copernicus came to an opposite<br/>conclusion from Ptolemy. To Copernicus it appeared that the<br/>difficulties attending the supposition that the celestial sphere<br/>revolved, were vastly greater than those which appeared so weighty<br/>to Ptolemy as to force him to deny the earth's rotation.<br/><br/>Copernicus shows clearly how tne observed phenomena could be<br/>accounted for just as completely by a rotation of the earth as by a<br/>rotation of the heavens. He alludes to the fact that, to those on<br/>board a vessel which is moving through smooth water, the vessel<br/>itself appears to be at rest, while the objects on shore seem to be<br/>moving past.<br/><br/>If, therefore, the earth were rotating uniformly, we dwellers<br/>upon the earth, oblivious of our own movement, would wrongly<br/>attribute to the stars the displacement which was actually the<br/>consequence of our own motion. Copernicus saw the futility of the<br/>arguments by which Ptolemy had endeavoured to demonstrate that a<br/>revolution of the earth was impossible. It was plain to him that<br/>there was nothing whatever to warrant refusal to believe in the<br/>rotation of the earth. In his clear-sightedness on this matter we<br/>have specially to admire the sagacity of Copernicus as a natural<br/>philosopher. It had been urged that, if the earth moved round, its<br/>motion would not be imparted to the air, and that therefore the<br/>earth would be uninhabitable by the terrific winds which would be<br/>the result of our being carried through the air. Copernicus<br/>convinced himself that this deduction was preposterous. He proved<br/>that the air must accompany the earth, just as his coat remains<br/>round him, notwithstanding the fact that he is walking down the<br/>street. In this way he was able to show that all a priori<br/>objections to the earth's movements were absurd, and therefore he<br/>was able to compare together the plausibilities of the two rival<br/>schemes for explaining the diurnal movement.<br/><br/>Once the issue had been placed in this form, the result could<br/>not be long in doubt. Here is the question : Which is it more<br/>likely—that the earth, like a grain of sand at the centre of a<br/>mighty globe, should turn round once in twenty-four hours, or—that<br/>the whole of that vast globe should complete a rotation in the<br/>opposite direction in the same time&#160;? Obviously, the former is<br/>far the more simple supposition. But the case is really much<br/>stronger than this. Ptolemy had supposed that all the stars were<br/>attached to the surface of a sphere. He had no ground whatever for<br/>this supposition, except that otherwise it would have been<br/>well-nigh impossible to have devised a scheme by which the rotation<br/>of the heavens around a fixed earth could have been arranged.<br/>Copernicus, however, with the just instinct of a philosopher,<br/>considered that the celestial sphere, however convenient from a<br/>geometrical point of view, as a means of representing apparent<br/>phenomena, could not actually have a material existence. In the<br/>first place, the existence of a material celestial sphere would<br/>require that all the myriad stars should be at exactly the same<br/>distances from the earth. Of course, no one will say that this or<br/>any other arbitrary disposition of the stars is actually<br/>impossible, but as there was no conceivable physical reason why the<br/>distances of all the stars from the earth should be identical, it<br/>seemed in the very highest degree improbable that the stars should<br/>be so placed.<br/><br/>Doubtless, also, Copernicus felt a considerable difficulty as to<br/>the nature of the materials from which Ptolemy's wonderful sphere<br/>was to be constructed. Nor could a philosopher of his penetration<br/>have failed to observe that, unless that sphere were infinitely<br/>large, there must have been space outside it, a consideration which<br/>would open up other difficult questions. Whether infinite or not,<br/>it was obvious that the celestial sphere must have a diameter at<br/>least many thousands of times as great as that of the earth. From<br/>these considerations Copernicus deduced the important fact that the<br/>stars and the other celestial bodies must all be vast objects. He<br/>was thus enabled to put the question in such a form that it could<br/>hardly receive any answer but the correct one. Which is it more<br/>rational to suppose, that the earth should turn round on its axis<br/>once in twenty-four hours, or that thousands of mighty stars should<br/>circle round the earth in the same time, many of them having to<br/>describe circles many thousands of times greater in circumference<br/>than the circuit of the earth at the equator&#160;? The obvious<br/>answer pressed upon Copernicus with so much force that he was<br/>compelled to reject Ptolemy's theory of the stationary earth, and<br/>to attribute the diurnal rotation of the heavens to the revolution<br/>of the earth on its axis.<br/><br/>Once this tremendous step had been taken, the great difficulties<br/>which beset the monstrous conception of the celestial sphere<br/>vanished, for the stars need no longer be regarded as situated at<br/>equal distances from the earth. Copernicus saw that they might lie<br/>at the most varied degrees of remoteness, some being hundreds or<br/>thousands of times farther away than others. The complicated<br/>structure of the celestial sphere as a material object disappeared<br/>altogether; it remained only as a geometrical conception, whereon<br/>we find it convenient to indicate the places of the stars. Once the<br/>Copernican doctrine had been fully set forth, it was impossible for<br/>anyone, who had both the inclination and the capacity to understand<br/>it, to withhold acceptance of its truth. The doctrine of a<br/>stationary earth had gone for ever.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
