<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>THE quaint town of Thorn, on the Vistula,<br/>[1]<br/>was<br/>more than two centuries old when Copernicus was born there on the<br/>19th of February, 1473. The situation of this town on the frontier<br/>between Prussia and Poland, with the commodious waterway offered by<br/>the river, made it a place of considerable trade. A view of the<br/>town, as it was at the time of the birth of Copernicus, is here<br/>given.<br/>[2]<br/>The walls, with their watch-towers, will<br/>be noted, and the strategic importance which the situation of Thorn<br/>gave to it in the fifteenth century still belongs thereto, so much<br/>so that the German Government recently constituted the town a<br/>fortress of the first class.<br/><br/>Copernicus, the astronomer, whose discoveries make him the great<br/>predecessor of Kepler and Newton, did not come from a noble family,<br/>as certain other early astronomers have done, for his father was a<br/>tradesman. Chroniclers are, however, careful to tell us that one of<br/>his uncles was a bishop. We are not acquainted with any of those<br/>details of his childhood or youth which are often of such interest<br/>in other cases where men have risen to exalted fame. It would<br/>appear that the young Nicolaus, for such was his Christian name,<br/>received his education at home until such time as he was deemed<br/>sufficiently advanced to be sent to the University at Cracow. The<br/>education that he there obtained must have been in those days of a<br/>very primitive description, but Copernicus seems to have availed<br/>himself of it to the utmost. He devoted himself more particularly<br/>to the study of medicine, with the view of adopting its practice as<br/>the profession of his life. The tendencies of the future astronomer<br/>were, however, revealed in the fact that he worked hard at<br/>mathematics, and, like one of his illustrious successors, Galileo,<br/>the practice of the art of painting had for him a very great<br/>interest, and in it he obtained some measure of success.<br/><br/>By the time he was twenty-seven years old, it would seem that<br/>Copernicus had given up the notion of becoming a medical<br/>practitioner, and had resolved to devote himself to science. He was<br/>engaged in teaching mathematics, and appears to have acquired some<br/>reputation. His growing fame attracted the notice of his uncle the<br/>bishop, at whose suggestion Copernicus took holy orders, and he was<br/>presently appointed to a canonry in the cathedral of Frauenhurg,<br/>near the mouth of the Vistula.<br/><br/>To Frauenburg, accordingly, this man of varied gifts retired.<br/>Possessing somewhat of the ascetic spirit, he resolved to devote<br/>his life to work of the most serious description. He eschewed all<br/>ordinary society, restricting his intimacies to very grave and<br/>learned companions, and refusing to engage in conversation of any<br/>useless kind. It would seem as if his gifts for painting were<br/>condemned as frivolous; at all events, we do not learn that he<br/>continued to practise them. In addition to the discharge of his<br/>theological duties, his life was occupied partly in ministering<br/>medically to the wants of the poor, and partly with his researches<br/>in astronomy and mathematics. His equipment in the matter of<br/>instruments for the study of the heavens seems to have been of a<br/>very meagre description. He arranged apertures in the walls of his<br/>house at Allenstein, so that he could observe in some fashion the<br/>passage of the stars across the meridian. That he possessed some<br/>talent for practical mechanics is proved by his construction of a<br/>contrivance for raising water from a stream, for the use of the<br/>inhabitants of Frauenburg. Relics of this machine are still to be<br/>Been.<br/><br/>
