CÃ´te d'Ivoire has a general copyright term of 99<br/>years and Honduras has 75 years, but<br/>they&#160;<br/>do<br/>&#160;implement the rule of the shorter<br/>term.<br/><br/><br/>The image was first published prior to 1923 in the United<br/>States, which makes it in the public domain in the United States<br/>now. &#160;Consult the source for additional information.<br/><br/>The text was taken from&#160;<br/>http://archive.org/details/greatastronomers00balluoft<br/>.<br/>&#160;It was published in 1895 (first edition) and 1907 (second<br/>edition), which is prior to 1923, therefore it is now in the public<br/>domain.<br/><br/>This eBook was uploaded and edited on Feedbooks by Stanley M.<br/>Sokolow in February, 2013.<br/>
