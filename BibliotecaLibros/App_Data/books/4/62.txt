THE LITTLE HOUSE


Foolish Tootles was standing like a conqueror over Wendy's body
when the other boys sprang, armed, from their trees.

"You are too late," he cried proudly, "I have shot the Wendy.
Peter will be so pleased with me."

Overhead Tinker Bell shouted "Silly ass!" and darted into
hiding. The others did not hear her. They had crowded round Wendy,
and as they looked a terrible silence fell upon the wood. If
Wendy's heart had been beating they would all have heard it.

Slightly was the first to speak. "This is no bird," he said in a
scared voice. "I think this must be a lady."

"A lady?" said Tootles, and fell a-trembling.

"And we have killed her," Nibs said hoarsely.

They all whipped off their caps.
