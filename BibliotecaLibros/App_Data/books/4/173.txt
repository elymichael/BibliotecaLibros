And then one night came the tragedy. It was the spring of the
year, and the story had been told for the night, and Jane was now
asleep in her bed. Wendy was sitting on the floor, very close to
the fire, so as to see to darn, for there was no other light in the
nursery; and while she sat darning she heard a crow. Then the
window blew open as of old, and Peter dropped in on the floor.

He was exactly the same as ever, and Wendy saw at once that he
still had all his first teeth.

He was a little boy, and she was grown up. She huddled by the
fire not daring to move, helpless and guilty, a big woman.

"Hullo, Wendy," he said, not noticing any difference, for he was
thinking chiefly of himself; and in the dim light her white dress
might have been the nightgown in which he had seen her first.

"Hullo, Peter," she replied faintly, squeezing herself as small
as possible. Something inside her was crying "Woman, Woman, let go
of me."

"Hullo, where is John?" he asked, suddenly missing the third
bed.

"John is not here now," she gasped.

"Is Michael asleep?" he asked, with a careless glance at
Jane.

"Yes," she answered; and now she felt that she was untrue to
Jane as well as to Peter.

"That is not Michael," she said quickly, lest a judgment should
fall on her.
