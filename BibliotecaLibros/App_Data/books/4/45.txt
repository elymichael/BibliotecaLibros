"What kind of adventure?" he asked cautiously.

"There's a pirate asleep in the pampas just beneath us," Peter
told him. "If you like, we'll go down and kill him."

"I don't see him," John said after a long pause.

"I do."

"Suppose," John said, a little huskily, "he were to wake
up."

Peter spoke indignantly. "You don't think I would kill him while
he was sleeping! I would wake him first, and then kill him. That's
the way I always do."

"I say! Do you kill many?"

"Tons."

John said "How ripping," but decided to have tea first. He asked
if there were many pirates on the island just now, and Peter said
he had never known so many.

"Who is captain now?"

"Hook," answered Peter, and his face became very stern as he
said that hated word.
