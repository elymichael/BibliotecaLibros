"If only I could go with you," Wendy sighed.<br/><br/>"You see you can't fly," said Jane.<br/><br/>Of course in the end Wendy let them fly away together. Our last<br/>glimpse of her shows her at the window, watching them receding into<br/>the sky until they were as small as stars.<br/><br/>As you look at Wendy, you may see her hair becoming white, and<br/>her figure little again, for all this happened long ago. Jane is<br/>now a common grown-up, with a daughter called Margaret; and every<br/>spring cleaning time, except when he forgets, Peter comes for<br/>Margaret and takes her to the Neverland, where she tells him<br/>stories about himself, to which he listens eagerly. When Margaret<br/>grows up she will have a daughter, who is to be Peter's mother in<br/>turn; and thus it will go on, so long as children are gay and<br/>innocent and heartless.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
