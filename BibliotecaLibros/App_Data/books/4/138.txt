"Stow this gab," roared Hook, and the spokesmen were dragged
back. "You, boy," he said, addressing John, "you look as if you had
a little pluck in you. Didst never want to be a pirate, my
hearty?"

Now John had sometimes experienced this hankering at maths.
prep.; and he was struck by Hook's picking him out.

"I once thought of calling myself Red-handed Jack," he said
diffidently.

"And a good name too. We'll call you that here, bully, if you
join."

"What do you think, Michael?" asked John.

"What would you call me if I join?" Michael demanded.

"Blackbeard Joe."

Michael was naturally impressed. "What do you think, John?" He
wanted John to decide, and John wanted him to decide.

"Shall we still be respectful subjects of the King?" John
inquired.

Through Hook's teeth came the answer: "You would have to swear,
'Down with the King.'"

Perhaps John had not behaved very well so far, but he shone out
now.
