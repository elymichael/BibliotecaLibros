"Yes. And of course they must see her light, and if they guess
we are near it they are sure to let fly."

"Wendy!"

"John!"

"Michael!"

"Tell her to go away at once, Peter," the three cried
simultaneously, but he refused.

"She thinks we have lost the way," he replied stiffly, "and she
is rather frightened. You don't think I would send her away all by
herself when she is frightened!"

For a moment the circle of light was broken, and something gave
Peter a loving little pinch.

"Then tell her," Wendy begged, "to put out her light."

"She can't put it out. That is about the only thing fairies
can't do. It just goes out of itself when she falls asleep, same as
the stars."

"Then tell her to sleep at once," John almost ordered.

"She can't sleep except when she's sleepy. It is the only other
thing fairies can't do."
