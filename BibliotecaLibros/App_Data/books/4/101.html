<br/>We have now reached the evening that was to be known among them<br/>as the Night of Nights, because of its adventures and their upshot.<br/>The day, as if quietly gathering its forces, had been almost<br/>uneventful, and now the redskins in their blankets were at their<br/>posts above, while, below, the children were having their evening<br/>meal; all except Peter, who had gone out to get the time. The way<br/>you got the time on the island was to find the crocodile, and then<br/>stay near him till the clock struck.<br/><br/>The meal happened to be a make-believe tea, and they sat around<br/>the board, guzzling in their greed; and really, what with their<br/>chatter and recriminations, the noise, as Wendy said, was<br/>positively deafening. To be sure, she did not mind noise, but she<br/>simply would not have them grabbing things, and then excusing<br/>themselves by saying that Tootles had pushed their elbow. There was<br/>a fixed rule that they must never hit back at meals, but should<br/>refer the matter of dispute to Wendy by raising the right arm<br/>politely and saying, "I complain of so-and-so;" but what usually<br/>happened was that they forgot to do this or did it too much.<br/><br/>"Silence," cried Wendy when for the twentieth time she had told<br/>them that they were not all to speak at once. "Is your mug empty,<br/>Slightly darling?"<br/><br/>"Not quite empty, mummy," Slightly said, after looking into an<br/>imaginary mug.<br/><br/>"He hasn't even begun to drink his milk," Nibs interposed.<br/><br/>This was telling, and Slightly seized his chance.<br/><br/>"I complain of Nibs," he cried promptly.<br/><br/>John, however, had held up his hand first.<br/><br/>"Well, John?"<br/><br/>"May I sit in Peter's chair, as he is not here?"<br/><br/>
