<br/>Not the pain of this but its unfairness was what dazed Peter. It<br/>made him quite helpless. He could only stare, horrified. Every<br/>child is affected thus the first time he is treated unfairly. All<br/>he thinks he has a right to when he comes to you to be yours is<br/>fairness. After you have been unfair to him he will love you again,<br/>but will never afterwards be quite the same boy. No one ever gets<br/>over the first unfairness; no one except Peter. He often met it,<br/>but he always forgot it. I suppose that was the real difference<br/>between him and all the rest.<br/><br/>So when he met it now it was like the first time; and he could<br/>just stare, helpless. Twice the iron hand clawed him.<br/><br/>A few moments afterwards the other boys saw Hook in the water<br/>striking wildly for the ship; no elation on the pestilent face now,<br/>only white fear, for the crocodile was in dogged pursuit of him. On<br/>ordinary occasions the boys would have swum alongside cheering; but<br/>now they were uneasy, for they had lost both Peter and Wendy, and<br/>were scouring the lagoon for them, calling them by name. They found<br/>the dinghy and went home in it, shouting "Peter, Wendy" as they<br/>went, but no answer came save mocking laughter from the mermaids.<br/>"They must be swimming back or flying," the boys concluded. They<br/>were not very anxious, because they had such faith in Peter. They<br/>chuckled, boylike, because they would be late for bed; and it was<br/>all mother Wendy's fault!<br/><br/>When their voices died away there came cold silence over the<br/>lagoon, and then a feeble cry.<br/><br/>"Help, help!"<br/><br/>Two small figures were beating against the rock; the girl had<br/>fainted and lay on the boy's arm. With a last effort Peter pulled<br/>her up the rock and then lay down beside her. Even as he also<br/>fainted he saw that the water was rising. He knew that they would<br/>soon be drowned, but he could do no more.<br/><br/>As they lay side by side a mermaid caught Wendy by the feet, and<br/>began pulling her softly into the water. Peter, feeling her slip<br/>from him, woke with a start, and was just in time to draw her back.<br/>But he had to tell her the truth.<br/><br/>"We are on the rock, Wendy," he said, "but it is growing<br/>smaller. Soon the water will be over it."<br/><br/>She did not understand even now.<br/><br/>"We must go," she said, almost brightly.<br/><br/>
