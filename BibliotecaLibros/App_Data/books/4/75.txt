Of course Slightly was the first to get his word in. "Wendy
lady," he said rapidly, "for you we built this house."

"Oh, say you're pleased," cried Nibs.

"Lovely, darling house," Wendy said, and they were the very
words they had hoped she would say.

"And we are your children," cried the twins.

Then all went on their knees, and holding out their arms cried,
"O Wendy lady, be our mother."

"Ought I?" Wendy said, all shining. "Of course it's frightfully
fascinating, but you see I am only a little girl. I have no real
experience."

"That doesn't matter," said Peter, as if he were the only person
present who knew all about it, though he was really the one who
knew least. "What we need is just a nice motherly person."

"Oh dear!" Wendy said, "you see, I feel that is exactly what I
am."

"It is, it is," they all cried; "we saw it at once."
