WHEN WENDY GREW UP


I hope you want to know what became of the other boys. They were
waiting below to give Wendy time to explain about them; and when
they had counted five hundred they went up. They went up by the
stair, because they thought this would make a better impression.
They stood in a row in front of Mrs. Darling, with their hats off,
and wishing they were not wearing their pirate clothes. They said
nothing, but their eyes asked her to have them. They ought to have
looked at Mr. Darling also, but they forgot about him.

Of course Mrs. Darling said at once that she would have them;
but Mr. Darling was curiously depressed, and they saw that he
considered six a rather large number.

"I must say," he said to Wendy, "that you don't do things by
halves," a grudging remark which the twins thought was pointed at
them.

The first twin was the proud one, and he asked, flushing, "Do
you think we should be too much of a handful, sir? Because, if so,
we can go away."

"Father!" Wendy cried, shocked; but still the cloud was on him.
He knew he was behaving unworthily, but he could not help it.

"We could lie doubled up," said Nibs.

"I always cut their hair myself," said Wendy.
