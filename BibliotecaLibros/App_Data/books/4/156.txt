"Full of remorse as ever, dearest! See my punishment: living in
a kennel."

"But it is punishment, isn't it, George? You are sure you are
not enjoying it?"

"My love!"

You may be sure she begged his pardon; and then, feeling drowsy,
he curled round in the kennel.

"Won't you play me to sleep," he asked, "on the nursery piano?"
and as she was crossing to the day-nursery he added thoughtlessly,
"And shut that window. I feel a draught."

"O George, never ask me to do that. The window must always be
left open for them, always, always."

Now it was his turn to beg her pardon; and she went into the
day-nursery and played, and soon he was asleep; and while he slept,
Wendy and John and Michael flew into the room.

Oh no. We have written it so, because that was the charming
arrangement planned by them before we left the ship; but something
must have happened since then, for it is not they who have flown
in, it is Peter and Tinker Bell.

Peter's first words tell all.

"Quick Tink," he whispered, "close the window; bar it! That's
right. Now you and I must get away by the door; and when Wendy
comes she will think her mother has barred her out; and she will
have to go back with me."
