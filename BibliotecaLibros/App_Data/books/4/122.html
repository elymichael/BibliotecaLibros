"And you will take your medicine?"<br/><br/>"Yes."<br/><br/>That seemed to be everything, and an awkward pause followed.<br/>Peter, however, was not the kind that breaks down before other<br/>people. "Are you ready, Tinker Bell?" he called out.<br/><br/>"Ay, ay."<br/><br/>"Then lead the way."<br/><br/>Tink darted up the nearest tree; but no one followed her, for it<br/>was at this moment that the pirates made their dreadful attack upon<br/>the redskins. Above, where all had been so still, the air was rent<br/>with shrieks and the clash of steel. Below, there was dead silence.<br/>Mouths opened and remained open. Wendy fell on her knees, but her<br/>arms were extended toward Peter. All arms were extended to him, as<br/>if suddenly blown in his direction; they were beseeching him mutely<br/>not to desert them. As for Peter, he seized his sword, the same he<br/>thought he had slain Barbecue with, and the lust of battle was in<br/>his eye.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
