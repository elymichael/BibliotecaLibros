They had caught her boarding the pirate ship with a knife in her
mouth. No watch was kept on the ship, it being Hook's boast that
the wind of his name guarded the ship for a mile around. Now her
fate would help to guard it also. One more wail would go the round
in that wind by night.

In the gloom that they brought with them the two pirates did not
see the rock till they crashed into it.

"Luff, you lubber," cried an Irish voice that was Smee's;
"here's the rock. Now, then, what we have to do is to hoist the
redskin on to it and leave her here to drown."

It was the work of one brutal moment to land the beautiful girl
on the rock; she was too proud to offer a vain resistance.

Quite near the rock, but out of sight, two heads were bobbing up
and down, Peter's and Wendy's. Wendy was crying, for it was the
first tragedy she had seen. Peter had seen many tragedies, but he
had forgotten them all. He was less sorry than Wendy for Tiger
Lily: it was two against one that angered him, and he meant to save
her. An easy way would have been to wait until the pirates had
gone, but he was never one to choose the easy way.

There was almost nothing he could not do, and he now imitated
the voice of Hook.

"Ahoy there, you lubbers!" he called. It was a marvellous
imitation.

"The captain!" said the pirates, staring at each other in
surprise.

"He must be swimming out to us," Starkey said, when they had
looked for him in vain.

"We are putting the redskin on the rock," Smee called out.

"Set her free," came the astonishing answer.
