<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>17<br/>WHEN WENDY GREW UP<br/><br/><br/>I hope you want to know what became of the other boys. They were<br/>waiting below to give Wendy time to explain about them; and when<br/>they had counted five hundred they went up. They went up by the<br/>stair, because they thought this would make a better impression.<br/>They stood in a row in front of Mrs. Darling, with their hats off,<br/>and wishing they were not wearing their pirate clothes. They said<br/>nothing, but their eyes asked her to have them. They ought to have<br/>looked at Mr. Darling also, but they forgot about him.<br/><br/>Of course Mrs. Darling said at once that she would have them;<br/>but Mr. Darling was curiously depressed, and they saw that he<br/>considered six a rather large number.<br/><br/>"I must say," he said to Wendy, "that you don't do things by<br/>halves," a grudging remark which the twins thought was pointed at<br/>them.<br/><br/>The first twin was the proud one, and he asked, flushing, "Do<br/>you think we should be too much of a handful, sir? Because, if so,<br/>we can go away."<br/><br/>"Father!" Wendy cried, shocked; but still the cloud was on him.<br/>He knew he was behaving unworthily, but he could not help it.<br/><br/>"We could lie doubled up," said Nibs.<br/><br/>"I always cut their hair myself," said Wendy.<br/>
