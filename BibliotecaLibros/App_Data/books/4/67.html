<br/>Do you think Tinker Bell was grateful to Wendy for raising her<br/>arm? Oh dear no, never wanted to pinch her so much. Fairies indeed<br/>are strange, and Peter, who understood them best, often cuffed<br/>[slapped] them.<br/><br/>But what to do with Wendy in her present delicate state of<br/>health?<br/><br/>"Let us carry her down into the house," Curly suggested.<br/><br/>"Ay," said Slightly, "that is what one does with ladies."<br/><br/>"No, no," Peter said, "you must not touch her. It would not be<br/>sufficiently respectful."<br/><br/>"That," said Slightly, "is what I was thinking."<br/><br/>"But if she lies there," Tootles said, "she will die."<br/><br/>"Ay, she will die," Slightly admitted, "but there is no way<br/>out."<br/><br/>"Yes, there is," cried Peter. "Let us build a little house round<br/>her."<br/><br/>They were all delighted. "Quick," he ordered them, "bring me<br/>each of you the best of what we have. Gut our house. Be sharp."<br/><br/>
