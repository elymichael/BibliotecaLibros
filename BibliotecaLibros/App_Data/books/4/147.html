"Something!" echoed Mullins.<br/><br/>"What of Cecco?" demanded Noodler.<br/><br/>"He's as dead as Jukes," said Hook shortly.<br/><br/>His reluctance to return to the cabin impressed them all<br/>unfavourably, and the mutinous sounds again broke forth. All<br/>pirates are superstitious, and Cookson cried, "They do say the<br/>surest sign a ship's accurst is when there's one on board more than<br/>can be accounted for."<br/><br/>"I've heard," muttered Mullins, "he always boards the pirate<br/>craft last. Had he a tail, captain?"<br/><br/>"They say," said another, looking viciously at Hook, "that when<br/>he comes it's in the likeness of the wickedest man aboard."<br/><br/>"Had he a hook, captain?" asked Cookson insolently; and one<br/>after another took up the cry, "The ship's doomed!" At this the<br/>children could not resist raising a cheer. Hook had well-nigh<br/>forgotten his prisoners, but as he swung round on them now his face<br/>lit up again.<br/><br/>"Lads," he cried to his crew, "now here's a notion. Open the<br/>cabin door and drive them in. Let them fight the doodle-doo for<br/>their lives. If they kill him, we're so much the better; if he<br/>kills them, we're none the worse."<br/><br/>For the last time his dogs admired Hook, and devotedly they did<br/>his bidding. The boys, pretending to struggle, were pushed into the<br/>cabin and the door was closed on them.<br/><br/>"Now, listen!" cried Hook, and all listened. But not one dared<br/>to face the door. Yes, one, Wendy, who all this time had been bound<br/>to the mast. It was for neither a scream nor a crow that she was<br/>watching, it was for the reappearance of Peter.<br/><br/>She had not long to wait. In the cabin he had found the thing<br/>for which he had gone in search: the key that would free the<br/>children of their manacles, and now they all stole forth, armed<br/>with such weapons as they could find. First signing them to hide,<br/>Peter cut Wendy's bonds, and then nothing could have been easier<br/>than for them all to fly off together; but one thing barred the<br/>way, an oath, "Hook or me this time." So when he had freed Wendy,<br/>he whispered for her to conceal herself with the others, and<br/>himself took her place by the mast, her cloak around him so that he<br/>should pass for her. Then he took a great breath and crowed.<br/>
