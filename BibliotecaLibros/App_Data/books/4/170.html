"That is a long time ago, sweetheart," says Wendy. "Ah me, how<br/>time flies!"<br/><br/>"Does it fly," asks the artful child, "the way you flew when you<br/>were a little girl?"<br/><br/>"The way I flew? Do you know, Jane, I sometimes wonder whether I<br/>ever did really fly."<br/><br/>"Yes, you did."<br/><br/>"The dear old days when I could fly!"<br/><br/>"Why can't you fly now, mother?"<br/><br/>"Because I am grown up, dearest. When people grow up they forget<br/>the way."<br/><br/>"Why do they forget the way?"<br/><br/>"Because they are no longer gay and innocent and heartless. It<br/>is only the gay and innocent and heartless who can fly."<br/><br/>"What is gay and innocent and heartless? I do wish I were gay<br/>and innocent and heartless."<br/><br/>Or perhaps Wendy admits she does see something.<br/>
