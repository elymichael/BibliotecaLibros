He<br/>threw himself sorrowfully on the ground.<br/><br/>"A lady to take care of us at last," said one of the twins, "and<br/>you have killed her!"<br/><br/>They were sorry for him, but sorrier for themselves, and when he<br/>took a step nearer them they turned from him.<br/><br/>Tootles' face was very white, but there was a dignity about him<br/>now that had never been there before.<br/><br/>"I did it," he said, reflecting. "When ladies used to come to me<br/>in dreams, I said, 'Pretty mother, pretty mother.' But when at last<br/>she really came, I shot her."<br/><br/>He moved slowly away.<br/><br/>"Don't go," they called in pity.<br/><br/>"I must," he answered, shaking; "I am so afraid of Peter."<br/><br/>It was at this tragic moment that they heard a sound which made<br/>the heart of every one of them rise to his mouth. They heard Peter<br/>crow.<br/><br/>"Peter!" they cried, for it was always thus that he signalled<br/>his return.<br/><br/>
