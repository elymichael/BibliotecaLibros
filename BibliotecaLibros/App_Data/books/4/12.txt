"Boy."

Then he had leapt into her arms. Such a little thing for Mr. and
Mrs. Darling and Nana to recall now, but not so little if that was
to be Michael's last night in the nursery.

They go on with their recollections.

"It was then that I rushed in like a tornado, wasn't it?" Mr.
Darling would say, scorning himself; and indeed he had been like a
tornado.

Perhaps there was some excuse for him. He, too, had been
dressing for the party, and all had gone well with him until he
came to his tie. It is an astounding thing to have to tell, but
this man, though he knew about stocks and shares, had no real
mastery of his tie. Sometimes the thing yielded to him without a
contest, but there were occasions when it would have been better
for the house if he had swallowed his pride and used a made-up
tie.

This was such an occasion. He came rushing into the nursery with
the crumpled little brute of a tie in his hand.

"Why, what is the matter, father dear?"

"Matter!" he yelled; he really yelled. "This tie, it will not
tie." He became dangerously sarcastic. "Not round my neck! Round
the bed-post! Oh yes, twenty times have I made it up round the
bed-post, but round my neck, no! Oh dear no! begs to be
excused!"

He thought Mrs. Darling was not sufficiently impressed, and he
went on sternly, "I warn you of this, mother, that unless this tie
is round my neck we don't go out to dinner to-night, and if I don't
go out to dinner to-night, I never go to the office again, and if I
don't go to the office again, you and I starve, and our children
will be flung into the streets."

Even then Mrs. Darling was placid. "Let me try, dear," she said,
and indeed that was what he had come to ask her to do, and with her
nice cool hands she tied his tie for him, while the children stood
around to see their fate decided. Some men would have resented her
being able to do it so easily, but Mr. Darling had far too fine a
nature for that; he thanked her carelessly, at once forgot his
rage, and in another moment was dancing round the room with Michael
on his back.
