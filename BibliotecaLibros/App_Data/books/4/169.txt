That was the last time the girl Wendy ever saw him. For a little
longer she tried for his sake not to have growing pains; and she
felt she was untrue to him when she got a prize for general
knowledge. But the years came and went without bringing the
careless boy; and when they met again Wendy was a married woman,
and Peter was no more to her than a little dust in the box in which
she had kept her toys. Wendy was grown up. You need not be sorry
for her. She was one of the kind that likes to grow up. In the end
she grew up of her own free will a day quicker than other
girls.

All the boys were grown up and done for by this time; so it is
scarcely worth while saying anything more about them. You may see
the twins and Nibs and Curly any day going to an office, each
carrying a little bag and an umbrella. Michael is an engine-driver
[train engineer]. Slightly married a lady of title, and so he
became a lord. You see that judge in a wig coming out at the iron
door? That used to be Tootles. The bearded man who doesn't know any
story to tell his children was once John.

Wendy was married in white with a pink sash. It is strange to
think that Peter did not alight in the church and forbid the banns
[formal announcement of a marriage].

Years rolled on again, and Wendy had a daughter. This ought not
to be written in ink but in a golden splash.

She was called Jane, and always had an odd inquiring look, as if
from the moment she arrived on the mainland she wanted to ask
questions. When she was old enough to ask them they were mostly
about Peter Pan. She loved to hear of Peter, and Wendy told her all
she could remember in the very nursery from which the famous flight
had taken place. It was Jane's nursery now, for her father had
bought it at the three per cents [mortgage rate] from Wendy's
father, who was no longer fond of stairs. Mrs. Darling was now dead
and forgotten.

There were only two beds in the nursery now, Jane's and her
nurse's; and there was no kennel, for Nana also had passed away.
She died of old age, and at the end she had been rather difficult
to get on with; being very firmly convinced that no one knew how to
look after children except herself.

Once a week Jane's nurse had her evening off; and then it was
Wendy's part to put Jane to bed. That was the time for stories. It
was Jane's invention to raise the sheet over her mother's head and
her own, this making a tent, and in the awful darkness to
whisper:

"What do we see now?"

"I don't think I see anything to-night," says Wendy, with a
feeling that if Nana were here she would object to further
conversation.

"Yes, you do," says Jane, "you see when you were a little
girl."
