When she expressed a doubtful hope that Tinker Bell would be
glad to see her he said, "Who is Tinker Bell?"

"O Peter," she said, shocked; but even when she explained he
could not remember.

"There are such a lot of them," he said. "I expect she is no
more."

I expect he was right, for fairies don't live long, but they are
so little that a short time seems a good while to them.

Wendy was pained too to find that the past year was but as
yesterday to Peter; it had seemed such a long year of waiting to
her. But he was exactly as fascinating as ever, and they had a
lovely spring cleaning in the little house on the tree tops.

Next year he did not come for her. She waited in a new frock
because the old one simply would not meet; but he never came.

"Perhaps he is ill," Michael said.

"You know he is never ill."

Michael came close to her and whispered, with a shiver, "Perhaps
there is no such person, Wendy!" and then Wendy would have cried if
Michael had not been crying.

Peter came next spring cleaning; and the strange thing was that
he never knew he had missed a year.
