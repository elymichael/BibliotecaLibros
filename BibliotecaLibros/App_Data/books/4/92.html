"Are you ready, boys?"<br/><br/>"Ay, ay," from various parts of the lagoon.<br/><br/>"Then lam into the pirates."<br/><br/>The fight was short and sharp. First to draw blood was John, who<br/>gallantly climbed into the boat and held Starkey. There was fierce<br/>struggle, in which the cutlass was torn from the pirate's grasp. He<br/>wriggled overboard and John leapt after him. The dinghy drifted<br/>away.<br/><br/>Here and there a head bobbed up in the water, and there was a<br/>flash of steel followed by a cry or a whoop. In the confusion some<br/>struck at their own side. The corkscrew of Smee got Tootles in the<br/>fourth rib, but he was himself pinked [nicked] in turn by Curly.<br/>Farther from the rock Starkey was pressing Slightly and the twins<br/>hard.<br/><br/>Where all this time was Peter? He was seeking bigger game.<br/><br/>The others were all brave boys, and they must not be blamed for<br/>backing from the pirate captain. His iron claw made a circle of<br/>dead water round him, from which they fled like affrighted<br/>fishes.<br/><br/>But there was one who did not fear him: there was one prepared<br/>to enter that circle.<br/><br/>Strangely, it was not in the water that they met. Hook rose to<br/>the rock to breathe, and at the same moment Peter scaled it on the<br/>opposite side. The rock was slippery as a ball, and they had to<br/>crawl rather than climb. Neither knew that the other was coming.<br/>Each feeling for a grip met the other's arm: in surprise they<br/>raised their heads; their faces were almost touching; so they<br/>met.<br/><br/>Some of the greatest heroes have confessed that just before they<br/>fell to [began combat] they had a sinking [feeling in the stomach].<br/>Had it been so with Peter at that moment I would admit it. After<br/>all, he was the only man that the Sea-Cook had feared. But Peter<br/>had no sinking, he had one feeling only, gladness; and he gnashed<br/>his pretty teeth with joy. Quick as thought he snatched a knife<br/>from Hook's belt and was about to drive it home, when he saw that<br/>he was higher up the rock that his foe. It would not have been<br/>fighting fair. He gave the pirate a hand to help him up.<br/><br/>It was then that Hook bit him.<br/>
