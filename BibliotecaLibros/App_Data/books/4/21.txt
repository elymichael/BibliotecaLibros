If he thought at all, but I don't believe he ever thought, it
was that he and his shadow, when brought near each other, would
join like drops of water, and when they did not he was appalled. He
tried to stick it on with soap from the bathroom, but that also
failed. A shudder passed through Peter, and he sat on the floor and
cried.

His sobs woke Wendy, and she sat up in bed. She was not alarmed
to see a stranger crying on the nursery floor; she was only
pleasantly interested.

"Boy," she said courteously, "why are you crying?"

Peter could be exceeding polite also, having learned the grand
manner at fairy ceremonies, and he rose and bowed to her
beautifully. She was much pleased, and bowed beautifully to him
from the bed.

"What's your name?" he asked.

"Wendy Moira Angela Darling," she replied with some
satisfaction. "What is your name?"

"Peter Pan."

She was already sure that he must be Peter, but it did seem a
comparatively short name.

"Is that all?"

"Yes," he said rather sharply. He felt for the first time that
it was a shortish name.
