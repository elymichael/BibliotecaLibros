<br/>"She says she glories in being abandoned," Peter<br/>interpreted.<br/><br/>He had a sudden idea. "Perhaps Tink wants to be my mother?"<br/><br/>"You silly ass!" cried Tinker Bell in a passion.<br/><br/>She had said it so often that Wendy needed no translation.<br/><br/>"I almost agree with her," Wendy snapped. Fancy Wendy snapping!<br/>But she had been much tried, and she little knew what was to happen<br/>before the night was out. If she had known she would not have<br/>snapped.<br/><br/>None of them knew. Perhaps it was best not to know. Their<br/>ignorance gave them one more glad hour; and as it was to be their<br/>last hour on the island, let us rejoice that there were sixty glad<br/>minutes in it. They sang and danced in their night-gowns. Such a<br/>deliciously creepy song it was, in which they pretended to be<br/>frightened at their own shadows, little witting that so soon<br/>shadows would close in upon them, from whom they would shrink in<br/>real fear. So uproariously gay was the dance, and how they buffeted<br/>each other on the bed and out of it! It was a pillow fight rather<br/>than a dance, and when it was finished, the pillows insisted on one<br/>bout more, like partners who know that they may never meet again.<br/>The stories they told, before it was time for Wendy's good-night<br/>story! Even Slightly tried to tell a story that night, but the<br/>beginning was so fearfully dull that it appalled not only the<br/>others but himself, and he said happily:<br/><br/>"Yes, it is a dull beginning. I say, let us pretend that it is<br/>the end."<br/><br/>And then at last they all got into bed for Wendy's story, the<br/>story they loved best, the story Peter hated. Usually when she<br/>began to tell this story he left the room or put his hands over his<br/>ears; and possibly if he had done either of those things this time<br/>they might all still be on the island. But to-night he remained on<br/>his stool; and we shall see what happened.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
