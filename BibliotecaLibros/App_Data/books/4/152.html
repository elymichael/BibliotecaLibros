<br/>Wendy, of course, had stood by taking no part in the fight,<br/>though watching Peter with glistening eyes; but now that all was<br/>over she became prominent again. She praised them equally, and<br/>shuddered delightfully when Michael showed her the place where he<br/>had killed one; and then she took them into Hook's cabin and<br/>pointed to his watch which was hanging on a nail. It said<br/>"half-past one!"<br/><br/>The lateness of the hour was almost the biggest thing of all.<br/>She got them to bed in the pirates' bunks pretty quickly, you may<br/>be sure; all but Peter, who strutted up and down on the deck, until<br/>at last he fell asleep by the side of Long Tom. He had one of his<br/>dreams that night, and cried in his sleep for a long time, and<br/>Wendy held him tightly.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
