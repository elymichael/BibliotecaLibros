<br/>"Now don't interrupt," he would beg of her.<br/><br/>"I have one pound seventeen here, and two and six at the office;<br/>I can cut off my coffee at the office, say ten shillings, making<br/>two nine and six, with your eighteen and three makes three nine<br/>seven, with five naught naught in my cheque-book makes eight nine<br/>seven—who is that moving?—eight nine seven, dot and carry<br/>seven—don't speak, my own—and the pound you lent to that man who<br/>came to the door—quiet, child—dot and carry child—there, you've<br/>done it!—did I say nine nine seven? yes, I said nine nine seven;<br/>the question is, can we try it for a year on nine nine seven?"<br/><br/>"Of course we can, George," she cried. But she was prejudiced in<br/>Wendy's favour, and he was really the grander character of the<br/>two.<br/><br/>"Remember mumps," he warned her almost threateningly, and off he<br/>went again. "Mumps one pound, that is what I have put down, but I<br/>daresay it will be more like thirty shillings—don't speak—measles<br/>one five, German measles half a guinea, makes two fifteen six—don't<br/>waggle your finger—whooping-cough, say fifteen shillings"—and so on<br/>it went, and it added up differently each time; but at last Wendy<br/>just got through, with mumps reduced to twelve six, and the two<br/>kinds of measles treated as one.<br/><br/>There was the same excitement over John, and Michael had even a<br/>narrower squeak; but both were kept, and soon, you might have seen<br/>the three of them going in a row to Miss Fulsom's Kindergarten<br/>school, accompanied by their nurse.<br/><br/>Mrs. Darling loved to have everything just so, and Mr. Darling<br/>had a passion for being exactly like his neighbours; so, of course,<br/>they had a nurse. As they were poor, owing to the amount of milk<br/>the children drank, this nurse was a prim Newfoundland dog, called<br/>Nana, who had belonged to no one in particular until the Darlings<br/>engaged her. She had always thought children important, however,<br/>and the Darlings had become acquainted with her in Kensington<br/>Gardens, where she spent most of her spare time peeping into<br/>perambulators, and was much hated by careless nursemaids, whom she<br/>followed to their homes and complained of to their mistresses. She<br/>proved to be quite a treasure of a nurse. How thorough she was at<br/>bath-time, and up at any moment of the night if one of her charges<br/>made the slightest cry. Of course her kennel was in the nursery.<br/>She had a genius for knowing when a cough is a thing to have no<br/>patience with and when it needs stocking around your throat. She<br/>believed to her last day in old-fashioned remedies like rhubarb<br/>leaf, and made sounds of contempt over all this new-fangled talk<br/>about germs, and so on. It was a lesson in propriety to see her<br/>escorting the children to school, walking sedately by their side<br/>when they were well behaved, and butting them back into line if<br/>they strayed. On John's footer [in England soccer was called<br/>football, "footer" for short] days she never once forgot his<br/>sweater, and she usually carried an umbrella in her mouth in case<br/>of rain. There is a room in the basement of Miss Fulsom's school<br/>where the nurses wait. They sat on forms, while Nana lay on the<br/>floor, but that was the only difference. They affected to ignore<br/>her as of an inferior social status to themselves, and she despised<br/>their light talk. She resented visits to the nursery from Mrs.<br/>Darling's friends, but if they did come she first whipped off<br/>Michael's pinafore and put him into the one with blue braiding, and<br/>smoothed out Wendy and made a dash at John's hair.<br/><br/>No nursery could possibly have been conducted more correctly,<br/>and Mr. Darling knew it, yet he sometimes wondered uneasily whether<br/>the neighbours talked.<br/><br/>He had his position in the city to consider.<br/><br/>Nana also troubled him in another way. He had sometimes a<br/>feeling that she did not admire him. "I know she admires you<br/>tremendously, George," Mrs. Darling would assure him, and then she<br/>would sign to the children to be specially nice to father. Lovely<br/>dances followed, in which the only other servant, Liza, was<br/>sometimes allowed to join. Such a midget she looked in her long<br/>skirt and maid's cap, though she had sworn, when engaged, that she<br/>would never see ten again. The gaiety of those romps! And gayest of<br/>all was Mrs. Darling, who would pirouette so wildly that all you<br/>could see of her was the kiss, and then if you had dashed at her<br/>you might have got it. There never was a simpler happier family<br/>until the coming of Peter Pan.<br/><br/>Mrs. Darling first heard of Peter when she was tidying up her<br/>children's minds. It is the nightly custom of every good mother<br/>after her children are asleep to rummage in their minds and put<br/>things straight for next morning, repacking into their proper<br/>places the many articles that have wandered during the day. If you<br/>could keep awake (but of course you can't) you would see your own<br/>mother doing this, and you would find it very interesting to watch<br/>her. It is quite like tidying up drawers. You would see her on her<br/>knees, I expect, lingering humorously over some of your contents,<br/>wondering where on earth you had picked this thing up, making<br/>discoveries sweet and not so sweet, pressing this to her cheek as<br/>if it were as nice as a kitten, and hurriedly stowing that out of<br/>sight. When you wake in the morning, the naughtiness and evil<br/>passions with which you went to bed have been folded up small and<br/>placed at the bottom of your mind and on the top, beautifully<br/>aired, are spread out your prettier thoughts, ready for you to put<br/>on.<br/><br/>
