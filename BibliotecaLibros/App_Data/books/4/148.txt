To the pirates it was a voice crying that all the boys lay slain
in the cabin; and they were panic-stricken. Hook tried to hearten
them; but like the dogs he had made them they showed him their
fangs, and he knew that if he took his eyes off them now they would
leap at him.

"Lads," he said, ready to cajole or strike as need be, but never
quailing for an instant, "I've thought it out. There's a Jonah
aboard."

"Ay," they snarled, "a man wi' a hook."

"No, lads, no, it's the girl. Never was luck on a pirate ship
wi' a woman on board. We'll right the ship when she's gone."

Some of them remembered that this had been a saying of Flint's.
"It's worth trying," they said doubtfully.

"Fling the girl overboard," cried Hook; and they made a rush at
the figure in the cloak.

"There's none can save you now, missy," Mullins hissed
jeeringly.

"There's one," replied the figure.

"Who's that?"

"Peter Pan the avenger!" came the terrible answer; and as he
spoke Peter flung off his cloak. Then they all knew who 'twas that
had been undoing them in the cabin, and twice Hook essayed to speak
and twice he failed. In that frightful moment I think his fierce
heart broke.
