"Hide her," they whispered, and gathered hastily around Wendy.<br/>But Tootles stood aloof.<br/><br/>Again came that ringing crow, and Peter dropped in front of<br/>them. "Greetings, boys," he cried, and mechanically they saluted,<br/>and then again was silence.<br/><br/>He frowned.<br/><br/>"I am back," he said hotly, "why do you not cheer?"<br/><br/>They opened their mouths, but the cheers would not come. He<br/>overlooked it in his haste to tell the glorious tidings.<br/><br/>"Great news, boys," he cried, "I have brought at last a mother<br/>for you all."<br/><br/>Still no sound, except a little thud from Tootles as he dropped<br/>on his knees.<br/><br/>"Have you not seen her?" asked Peter, becoming troubled. "She<br/>flew this way."<br/><br/>"Ah me!" once voice said, and another said, "Oh, mournful<br/>day."<br/><br/>Tootles rose. "Peter," he said quietly, "I will show her to<br/>you," and when the others would still have hidden her he said,<br/>"Back, twins, let Peter see."<br/><br/>So they all stood back, and let him see, and after he had looked<br/>for a little time he did not know what to do next.<br/>
