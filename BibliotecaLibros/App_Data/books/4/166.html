"There are always a lot of young ones," explained Wendy, who was<br/>now quite an authority, "because you see when a new baby laughs for<br/>the first time a new fairy is born, and as there are always new<br/>babies there are always new fairies. They live in nests on the tops<br/>of trees; and the mauve ones are boys and the white ones are girls,<br/>and the blue ones are just little sillies who are not sure what<br/>they are."<br/><br/>"I shall have such fun," said Peter, with eye on Wendy.<br/><br/>"It will be rather lonely in the evening," she said, "sitting by<br/>the fire."<br/><br/>"I shall have Tink."<br/><br/>"Tink can't go a twentieth part of the way round," she reminded<br/>him a little tartly.<br/><br/>"Sneaky tell-tale!" Tink called out from somewhere round the<br/>corner.<br/><br/>"It doesn't matter," Peter said.<br/><br/>"O Peter, you know it matters."<br/><br/>"Well, then, come with me to the little house."<br/><br/>"May I, mummy?"<br/><br/>"Certainly not. I have got you home again, and I mean to keep<br/>you."<br/>
