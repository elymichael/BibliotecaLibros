"My hook thinks you did," said Hook, crossing to him. "I wonder
if it would not be advisable, Starkey, to humour the hook?"

"I'll swing before I go in there," replied Starkey doggedly, and
again he had the support of the crew.

"Is this mutiny?" asked Hook more pleasantly than ever.
"Starkey's ringleader!"

"Captain, mercy!" Starkey whimpered, all of a tremble now.

"Shake hands, Starkey," said Hook, proffering his claw.

Starkey looked round for help, but all deserted him. As he
backed up Hook advanced, and now the red spark was in his eye. With
a despairing scream the pirate leapt upon Long Tom and precipitated
himself into the sea.

"Four," said Slightly.

"And now," Hook said courteously, "did any other gentlemen say
mutiny?" Seizing a lantern and raising his claw with a menacing
gesture, "I'll bring out that doodle-doo myself," he said, and sped
into the cabin.

"Five." How Slightly longed to say it. He wetted his lips to be
ready, but Hook came staggering out, without his lantern.

"Something blew out the light," he said a little unsteadily.
