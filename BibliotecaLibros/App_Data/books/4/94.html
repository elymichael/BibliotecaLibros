"Yes," he answered faintly.<br/><br/>"Shall we swim or fly, Peter?"<br/><br/>He had to tell her.<br/><br/>"Do you think you could swim or fly as far as the island, Wendy,<br/>without my help?"<br/><br/>She had to admit that she was too tired.<br/><br/>He moaned.<br/><br/>"What is it?" she asked, anxious about him at once.<br/><br/>"I can't help you, Wendy. Hook wounded me. I can neither fly nor<br/>swim."<br/><br/>"Do you mean we shall both be drowned?"<br/><br/>"Look how the water is rising."<br/><br/>They put their hands over their eyes to shut out the sight. They<br/>thought they would soon be no more. As they sat thus something<br/>brushed against Peter as light as a kiss, and stayed there, as if<br/>saying timidly, "Can I be of any use?"<br/>
