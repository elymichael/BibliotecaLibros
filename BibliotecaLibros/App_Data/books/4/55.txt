While they talked they heard a distant sound. You or I, not
being wild things of the woods, would have heard nothing, but they
heard it, and it was the grim song:


"Yo ho, yo ho, the pirate life,
The flag o' skull and bones,
A merry hour, a hempen rope,
And hey for Davy Jones."


At once the lost boysâ€”but where are they? They are no longer
there. Rabbits could not have disappeared more quickly.

I will tell you where they are. With the exception of Nibs, who
has darted away to reconnoitre [look around], they are already in
their home under the ground, a very delightful residence of which
we shall see a good deal presently. But how have they reached it?
for there is no entrance to be seen, not so much as a large stone,
which if rolled away, would disclose the mouth of a cave. Look
closely, however, and you may note that there are here seven large
trees, each with a hole in its hollow trunk as large as a boy.
These are the seven entrances to the home under the ground, for
which Hook has been searching in vain these many moons. Will he
find it tonight?

As the pirates advanced, the quick eye of Starkey sighted Nibs
disappearing through the wood, and at once his pistol flashed out.
But an iron claw gripped his shoulder.

"Captain, let go!" he cried, writhing.

Now for the first time we hear the voice of Hook. It was a black
voice. "Put back that pistol first," it said threateningly.

"It was one of those boys you hate. I could have shot him
dead."
