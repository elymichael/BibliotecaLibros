"Hide her," they whispered, and gathered hastily around Wendy.
But Tootles stood aloof.

Again came that ringing crow, and Peter dropped in front of
them. "Greetings, boys," he cried, and mechanically they saluted,
and then again was silence.

He frowned.

"I am back," he said hotly, "why do you not cheer?"

They opened their mouths, but the cheers would not come. He
overlooked it in his haste to tell the glorious tidings.

"Great news, boys," he cried, "I have brought at last a mother
for you all."

Still no sound, except a little thud from Tootles as he dropped
on his knees.

"Have you not seen her?" asked Peter, becoming troubled. "She
flew this way."

"Ah me!" once voice said, and another said, "Oh, mournful
day."

Tootles rose. "Peter," he said quietly, "I will show her to
you," and when the others would still have hidden her he said,
"Back, twins, let Peter see."

So they all stood back, and let him see, and after he had looked
for a little time he did not know what to do next.
