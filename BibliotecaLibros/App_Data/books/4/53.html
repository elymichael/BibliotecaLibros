<br/>Next comes Nibs, the gay and debonair, followed by Slightly, who<br/>cuts whistles out of the trees and dances ecstatically to his own<br/>tunes. Slightly is the most conceited of the boys. He thinks he<br/>remembers the days before he was lost, with their manners and<br/>customs, and this has given his nose an offensive tilt. Curly is<br/>fourth; he is a pickle, [a person who gets in pickles-predicaments]<br/>and so often has he had to deliver up his person when Peter said<br/>sternly, "Stand forth the one who did this thing," that now at the<br/>command he stands forth automatically whether he has done it or<br/>not. Last come the Twins, who cannot be described because we should<br/>be sure to be describing the wrong one. Peter never quite knew what<br/>twins were, and his band were not allowed to know anything he did<br/>not know, so these two were always vague about themselves, and did<br/>their best to give satisfaction by keeping close together in an<br/>apologetic sort of way.<br/><br/>The boys vanish in the gloom, and after a pause, but not a long<br/>pause, for things go briskly on the island, come the pirates on<br/>their track. We hear them before they are seen, and it is always<br/>the same dreadful song:<br/><br/><br/>"Avast belay, yo ho, heave to,<br/>A-pirating we go,<br/>And if we're parted by a shot<br/>We're sure to meet below!"<br/><br/><br/>A more villainous-looking lot never hung in a row on Execution<br/>dock. Here, a little in advance, ever and again with his head to<br/>the ground listening, his great arms bare, pieces of eight in his<br/>ears as ornaments, is the handsome Italian Cecco, who cut his name<br/>in letters of blood on the back of the governor of the prison at<br/>Gao. That gigantic black behind him has had many names since he<br/>dropped the one with which dusky mothers still terrify their<br/>children on the banks of the Guadjo-mo. Here is Bill Jukes, every<br/>inch of him tattooed, the same Bill Jukes who got six dozen on the<br/>WALRUS from Flint before he would drop the bag of moidores<br/>[Portuguese gold pieces]; and Cookson, said to be Black Murphy's<br/>brother (but this was never proved), and Gentleman Starkey, once an<br/>usher in a public school and still dainty in his ways of killing;<br/>and Skylights (Morgan's Skylights); and the Irish bo'sun Smee, an<br/>oddly genial man who stabbed, so to speak, without offence, and was<br/>the only Non-conformist in Hook's crew; and Noodler, whose hands<br/>were fixed on backwards; and Robt. Mullins and Alf Mason and many<br/>another ruffian long known and feared on the Spanish Main.<br/><br/>In the midst of them, the blackest and largest in that dark<br/>setting, reclined James Hook, or as he wrote himself, Jas. Hook, of<br/>whom it is said he was the only man that the Sea-Cook feared. He<br/>lay at his ease in a rough chariot drawn and propelled by his men,<br/>and instead of a right hand he had the iron hook with which ever<br/>and anon he encouraged them to increase their pace. As dogs this<br/>terrible man treated and addressed them, and as dogs they obeyed<br/>him. In person he was cadaverous [dead looking] and blackavized<br/>[dark faced], and his hair was dressed in long curls, which at a<br/>little distance looked like black candles, and gave a singularly<br/>threatening expression to his handsome countenance. His eyes were<br/>of the blue of the forget-me-not, and of a profound melancholy,<br/>save when he was plunging his hook into you, at which time two red<br/>spots appeared in them and lit them up horribly. In manner,<br/>something of the grand seigneur still clung to him, so that he even<br/>ripped you up with an air, and I have been told that he was a<br/>RACONTEUR [storyteller] of repute. He was never more sinister than<br/>when he was most polite, which is probably the truest test of<br/>breeding; and the elegance of his diction, even when he was<br/>swearing, no less than the distinction of his demeanour, showed him<br/>one of a different cast from his crew. A man of indomitable<br/>courage, it was said that the only thing he shied at was the sight<br/>of his own blood, which was thick and of an unusual colour. In<br/>dress he somewhat aped the attire associated with the name of<br/>Charles II, having heard it said in some earlier period of his<br/>career that he bore a strange resemblance to the ill-fated Stuarts;<br/>and in his mouth he had a holder of his own contrivance which<br/>enabled him to smoke two cigars at once. But undoubtedly the<br/>grimmest part of him was his iron claw.<br/><br/>Let us now kill a pirate, to show Hook's method. Skylights will<br/>do. As they pass, Skylights lurches clumsily against him, ruffling<br/>his lace collar; the hook shoots forth, there is a tearing sound<br/>and one screech, then the body is kicked aside, and the pirates<br/>pass on. He has not even taken the cigars from his mouth.<br/><br/>Such is the terrible man against whom Peter Pan is pitted. Which<br/>will win?<br/><br/>On the trail of the pirates, stealing noiselessly down the<br/>war-path, which is not visible to inexperienced eyes, come the<br/>redskins, every one of them with his eyes peeled. They carry<br/>tomahawks and knives, and their naked bodies gleam with paint and<br/>oil. Strung around them are scalps, of boys as well as of pirates,<br/>for these are the Piccaninny tribe, and not to be confused with the<br/>softer-hearted Delawares or the Hurons. In the van, on all fours,<br/>is Great Big Little Panther, a brave of so many scalps that in his<br/>present position they somewhat impede his progress. Bringing up the<br/>rear, the place of greatest danger, comes Tiger Lily, proudly<br/>erect, a princess in her own right. She is the most beautiful of<br/>dusky Dianas [Diana = goddess of the woods] and the belle of the<br/>Piccaninnies, coquettish [flirting], cold and amorous [loving] by<br/>turns; there is not a brave who would not have the wayward thing to<br/>wife, but she staves off the altar with a hatchet. Observe how they<br/>pass over fallen twigs without making the slightest noise. The only<br/>sound to be heard is their somewhat heavy breathing. The fact is<br/>that they are all a little fat just now after the heavy gorging,<br/>but in time they will work this off. For the moment, however, it<br/>constitutes their chief danger.<br/>
