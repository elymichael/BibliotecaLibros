<br/>The redskins disappear as they have come like shadows, and soon<br/>their place is taken by the beasts, a great and motley procession:<br/>lions, tigers, bears, and the innumerable smaller savage things<br/>that flee from them, for every kind of beast, and, more<br/>particularly, all the man-eaters, live cheek by jowl on the<br/>favoured island. Their tongues are hanging out, they are hungry<br/>to-night.<br/><br/>When they have passed, comes the last figure of all, a gigantic<br/>crocodile. We shall see for whom she is looking presently.<br/><br/>The crocodile passes, but soon the boys appear again, for the<br/>procession must continue indefinitely until one of the parties<br/>stops or changes its pace. Then quickly they will be on top of each<br/>other.<br/><br/>All are keeping a sharp look-out in front, but none suspects<br/>that the danger may be creeping up from behind. This shows how real<br/>the island was.<br/><br/>The first to fall out of the moving circle was the boys. They<br/>flung themselves down on the sward [turf], close to their<br/>underground home.<br/><br/>"I do wish Peter would come back," every one of them said<br/>nervously, though in height and still more in breadth they were all<br/>larger than their captain.<br/><br/>"I am the only one who is not afraid of the pirates," Slightly<br/>said, in the tone that prevented his being a general favourite; but<br/>perhaps some distant sound disturbed him, for he added hastily,<br/>"but I wish he would come back, and tell us whether he has heard<br/>anything more about Cinderella."<br/><br/>They talked of Cinderella, and Tootles was confident that his<br/>mother must have been very like her.<br/><br/>It was only in Peter's absence that they could speak of mothers,<br/>the subject being forbidden by him as silly.<br/><br/>"All I remember about my mother," Nibs told them, "is that she<br/>often said to my father, 'Oh, how I wish I had a cheque-book of my<br/>own!' I don't know what a cheque-book is, but I should just love to<br/>give my mother one."<br/><br/>
