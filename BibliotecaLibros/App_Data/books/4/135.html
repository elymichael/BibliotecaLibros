<br/>Good form! However much he may have degenerated, he still knew<br/>that this is all that really matters.<br/><br/>From far within him he heard a creaking as of rusty portals, and<br/>through them came a stern tap-tap-tap, like hammering in the night<br/>when one cannot sleep. "Have you been good form to-day?" was their<br/>eternal question.<br/><br/>"Fame, fame, that glittering bauble, it is mine," he cried.<br/><br/>"Is it quite good form to be distinguished at anything?" the<br/>tap-tap from his school replied.<br/><br/>"I am the only man whom Barbecue feared," he urged, "and Flint<br/>feared Barbecue."<br/><br/>"Barbecue, Flintâ€”what house?" came the cutting retort.<br/><br/>Most disquieting reflection of all, was it not bad form to think<br/>about good form?<br/><br/>His vitals were tortured by this problem. It was a claw within<br/>him sharper than the iron one; and as it tore him, the perspiration<br/>dripped down his tallow [waxy] countenance and streaked his<br/>doublet. Ofttimes he drew his sleeve across his face, but there was<br/>no damming that trickle.<br/><br/>Ah, envy not Hook.<br/><br/>There came to him a presentiment of his early dissolution<br/>[death]. It was as if Peter's terrible oath had boarded the ship.<br/>Hook felt a gloomy desire to make his dying speech, lest presently<br/>there should be no time for it.<br/><br/>
