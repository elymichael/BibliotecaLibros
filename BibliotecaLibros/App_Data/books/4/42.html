<br/>"I'm Wendy," she said agitatedly.<br/><br/>He was very sorry. "I say, Wendy," he whispered to her, "always<br/>if you see me forgetting you, just keep on saying 'I'm Wendy,' and<br/>then I'll remember."<br/><br/>Of course this was rather unsatisfactory. However, to make<br/>amends he showed them how to lie out flat on a strong wind that was<br/>going their way, and this was such a pleasant change that they<br/>tried it several times and found that they could sleep thus with<br/>security. Indeed they would have slept longer, but Peter tired<br/>quickly of sleeping, and soon he would cry in his captain voice,<br/>"We get off here." So with occasional tiffs, but on the whole<br/>rollicking, they drew near the Neverland; for after many moons they<br/>did reach it, and, what is more, they had been going pretty<br/>straight all the time, not perhaps so much owing to the guidance of<br/>Peter or Tink as because the island was looking for them. It is<br/>only thus that any one may sight those magic shores.<br/><br/>"There it is," said Peter calmly.<br/><br/>"Where, where?"<br/><br/>"Where all the arrows are pointing."<br/><br/>Indeed a million golden arrows were pointing it out to the<br/>children, all directed by their friend the sun, who wanted them to<br/>be sure of their way before leaving them for the night.<br/><br/>Wendy and John and Michael stood on tip-toe in the air to get<br/>their first sight of the island. Strange to say, they all<br/>recognized it at once, and until fear fell upon them they hailed<br/>it, not as something long dreamt of and seen at last, but as a<br/>familiar friend to whom they were returning home for the<br/>holidays.<br/><br/>"John, there's the lagoon."<br/><br/>"Wendy, look at the turtles burying their eggs in the sand."<br/><br/>
