Peter looked. "Hullo, is it a new one?"

"Yes."

"Boy or girl?"

"Girl."

Now surely he would understand; but not a bit of it.

"Peter," she said, faltering, "are you expecting me to fly away
with you?"

"Of course; that is why I have come." He added a little sternly,
"Have you forgotten that this is spring cleaning time?"

She knew it was useless to say that he had let many spring
cleaning times pass.

"I can't come," she said apologetically, "I have forgotten how
to fly."

"I'll soon teach you again."

"O Peter, don't waste the fairy dust on me."
