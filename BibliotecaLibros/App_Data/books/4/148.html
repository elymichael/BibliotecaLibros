<br/>To the pirates it was a voice crying that all the boys lay slain<br/>in the cabin; and they were panic-stricken. Hook tried to hearten<br/>them; but like the dogs he had made them they showed him their<br/>fangs, and he knew that if he took his eyes off them now they would<br/>leap at him.<br/><br/>"Lads," he said, ready to cajole or strike as need be, but never<br/>quailing for an instant, "I've thought it out. There's a Jonah<br/>aboard."<br/><br/>"Ay," they snarled, "a man wi' a hook."<br/><br/>"No, lads, no, it's the girl. Never was luck on a pirate ship<br/>wi' a woman on board. We'll right the ship when she's gone."<br/><br/>Some of them remembered that this had been a saying of Flint's.<br/>"It's worth trying," they said doubtfully.<br/><br/>"Fling the girl overboard," cried Hook; and they made a rush at<br/>the figure in the cloak.<br/><br/>"There's none can save you now, missy," Mullins hissed<br/>jeeringly.<br/><br/>"There's one," replied the figure.<br/><br/>"Who's that?"<br/><br/>"Peter Pan the avenger!" came the terrible answer; and as he<br/>spoke Peter flung off his cloak. Then they all knew who 'twas that<br/>had been undoing them in the cabin, and twice Hook essayed to speak<br/>and twice he failed. In that frightful moment I think his fierce<br/>heart broke.<br/><br/>
