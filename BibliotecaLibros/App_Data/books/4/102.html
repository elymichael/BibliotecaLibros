"Sit in father's chair, John!" Wendy was scandalised. "Certainly<br/>not."<br/><br/>"He is not really our father," John answered. "He didn't even<br/>know how a father does till I showed him."<br/><br/>This was grumbling. "We complain of John," cried the twins.<br/><br/>Tootles held up his hand. He was so much the humblest of them,<br/>indeed he was the only humble one, that Wendy was specially gentle<br/>with him.<br/><br/>"I don't suppose," Tootles said diffidently [bashfully or<br/>timidly], "that I could be father."<br/><br/>"No, Tootles."<br/><br/>Once Tootles began, which was not very often, he had a silly way<br/>of going on.<br/><br/>"As I can't be father," he said heavily, "I don't suppose,<br/>Michael, you would let me be baby?"<br/><br/>"No, I won't," Michael rapped out. He was already in his<br/>basket.<br/><br/>"As I can't be baby," Tootles said, getting heavier and heavier<br/>and heavier, "do you think I could be a twin?"<br/><br/>"No, indeed," replied the twins; "it's awfully difficult to be a<br/>twin."<br/>
