<br/>Certainly they did not pretend to be sleepy, they were sleepy;<br/>and that was a danger, for the moment they popped off, down they<br/>fell. The awful thing was that Peter thought this funny.<br/><br/>"There he goes again!" he would cry gleefully, as Michael<br/>suddenly dropped like a stone.<br/><br/>"Save him, save him!" cried Wendy, looking with horror at the<br/>cruel sea far below. Eventually Peter would dive through the air,<br/>and catch Michael just before he could strike the sea, and it was<br/>lovely the way he did it; but he always waited till the last<br/>moment, and you felt it was his cleverness that interested him and<br/>not the saving of human life. Also he was fond of variety, and the<br/>sport that engrossed him one moment would suddenly cease to engage<br/>him, so there was always the possibility that the next time you<br/>fell he would let you go.<br/><br/>He could sleep in the air without falling, by merely lying on<br/>his back and floating, but this was, partly at least, because he<br/>was so light that if you got behind him and blew he went<br/>faster.<br/><br/>"Do be more polite to him," Wendy whispered to John, when they<br/>were playing "Follow my Leader."<br/><br/>"Then tell him to stop showing off," said John.<br/><br/>When playing Follow my Leader, Peter would fly close to the<br/>water and touch each shark's tail in passing, just as in the street<br/>you may run your finger along an iron railing. They could not<br/>follow him in this with much success, so perhaps it was rather like<br/>showing off, especially as he kept looking behind to see how many<br/>tails they missed.<br/><br/>"You must be nice to him," Wendy impressed on her brothers.<br/>"What could we do if he were to leave us!"<br/><br/>"We could go back," Michael said.<br/><br/>"How could we ever find our way back without him?"<br/><br/>
