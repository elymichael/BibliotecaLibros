"Better for Hook," he cried, "if he had had less ambition!" It
was in his darkest hours only that he referred to himself in the
third person.

"No little children to love me!"

Strange that he should think of this, which had never troubled
him before; perhaps the sewing machine brought it to his mind. For
long he muttered to himself, staring at Smee, who was hemming
placidly, under the conviction that all children feared him.

Feared him! Feared Smee! There was not a child on board the brig
that night who did not already love him. He had said horrid things
to them and hit them with the palm of his hand, because he could
not hit with his fist, but they had only clung to him the more.
Michael had tried on his spectacles.

To tell poor Smee that they thought him lovable! Hook itched to
do it, but it seemed too brutal. Instead, he revolved this mystery
in his mind: why do they find Smee lovable? He pursued the problem
like the sleuth-hound that he was. If Smee was lovable, what was it
that made him so? A terrible answer suddenly presented itselfâ€”"Good
form?"

Had the bo'sun good form without knowing it, which is the best
form of all?

He remembered that you have to prove you don't know you have it
before you are eligible for Pop [an elite social club at Eton].

With a cry of rage he raised his iron hand over Smee's head; but
he did not tear. What arrested him was this reflection:

"To claw a man because he is good form, what would that be?"

"Bad form!"

The unhappy Hook was as impotent [powerless] as he was damp, and
he fell forward like a cut flower.
