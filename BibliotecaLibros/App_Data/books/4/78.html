<br/>When she sat down to a basketful of their stockings, every heel<br/>with a hole in it, she would fling up her arms and exclaim, "Oh<br/>dear, I am sure I sometimes think spinsters are to be envied!"<br/><br/>Her face beamed when she exclaimed this.<br/><br/>You remember about her pet wolf. Well, it very soon discovered<br/>that she had come to the island and it found her out, and they just<br/>ran into each other's arms. After that it followed her about<br/>everywhere.<br/><br/>As time wore on did she think much about the beloved parents she<br/>had left behind her? This is a difficult question, because it is<br/>quite impossible to say how time does wear on in the Neverland,<br/>where it is calculated by moons and suns, and there are ever so<br/>many more of them than on the mainland. But I am afraid that Wendy<br/>did not really worry about her father and mother; she was<br/>absolutely confident that they would always keep the window open<br/>for her to fly back by, and this gave her complete ease of mind.<br/>What did disturb her at times was that John remembered his parents<br/>vaguely only, as people he had once known, while Michael was quite<br/>willing to believe that she was really his mother. These things<br/>scared her a little, and nobly anxious to do her duty, she tried to<br/>fix the old life in their minds by setting them examination papers<br/>on it, as like as possible to the ones she used to do at school.<br/>The other boys thought this awfully interesting, and insisted on<br/>joining, and they made slates for themselves, and sat round the<br/>table, writing and thinking hard about the questions she had<br/>written on another slate and passed round. They were the most<br/>ordinary questions—"What was the colour of Mother's eyes? Which was<br/>taller, Father or Mother? Was Mother blonde or brunette? Answer all<br/>three questions if possible." "(A) Write an essay of not less than<br/>40 words on How I spent my last Holidays, or The Characters of<br/>Father and Mother compared. Only one of these to be attempted." Or<br/>"(1) Describe Mother's laugh; (2) Describe Father's laugh; (3)<br/>Describe Mother's Party Dress; (4) Describe the Kennel and its<br/>Inmate."<br/><br/>They were just everyday questions like these, and when you could<br/>not answer them you were told to make a cross; and it was really<br/>dreadful what a number of crosses even John made. Of course the<br/>only boy who replied to every question was Slightly, and no one<br/>could have been more hopeful of coming out first, but his answers<br/>were perfectly ridiculous, and he really came out last: a<br/>melancholy thing.<br/><br/>Peter did not compete. For one thing he despised all mothers<br/>except Wendy, and for another he was the only boy on the island who<br/>could neither write nor spell; not the smallest word. He was above<br/>all that sort of thing.<br/><br/>By the way, the questions were all written in the past tense.<br/>What was the colour of Mother's eyes, and so on. Wendy, you see,<br/>had been forgetting, too.<br/><br/>Adventures, of course, as we shall see, were of daily<br/>occurrence; but about this time Peter invented, with Wendy's help,<br/>a new game that fascinated him enormously, until he suddenly had no<br/>more interest in it, which, as you have been told, was what always<br/>happened with his games. It consisted in pretending not to have<br/>adventures, in doing the sort of thing John and Michael had been<br/>doing all their lives, sitting on stools flinging balls in the air,<br/>pushing each other, going out for walks and coming back without<br/>having killed so much as a grizzly. To see Peter doing nothing on a<br/>stool was a great sight; he could not help looking solemn at such<br/>times, to sit still seemed to him such a comic thing to do. He<br/>boasted that he had gone walking for the good of his health. For<br/>several suns these were the most novel of all adventures to him;<br/>and John and Michael had to pretend to be delighted also; otherwise<br/>he would have treated them severely.<br/><br/>He often went out alone, and when he came back you were never<br/>absolutely certain whether he had had an adventure or not. He might<br/>have forgotten it so completely that he said nothing about it; and<br/>then when you went out you found the body; and, on the other hand,<br/>he might say a great deal about it, and yet you could not find the<br/>body. Sometimes he came home with his head bandaged, and then Wendy<br/>cooed over him and bathed it in lukewarm water, while he told a<br/>dazzling tale. But she was never quite sure, you know. There were,<br/>however, many adventures which she knew to be true because she was<br/>in them herself, and there were still more that were at least<br/>partly true, for the other boys were in them and said they were<br/>wholly true. To describe them all would require a book as large as<br/>an English-Latin, Latin-English Dictionary, and the most we can do<br/>is to give one as a specimen of an average hour on the island. The<br/>difficulty is which one to choose. Should we take the brush with<br/>the redskins at Slightly Gulch? It was a sanguinary [cheerful]<br/>affair, and especially interesting as showing one of Peter's<br/>peculiarities, which was that in the middle of a fight he would<br/>suddenly change sides. At the Gulch, when victory was still in the<br/>balance, sometimes leaning this way and sometimes that, he called<br/>out, "I'm redskin to-day; what are you, Tootles?" And Tootles<br/>answered, "Redskin; what are you, Nibs?" and Nibs said, "Redskin;<br/>what are you Twin?" and so on; and they were all redskins; and of<br/>course this would have ended the fight had not the real redskins<br/>fascinated by Peter's methods, agreed to be lost boys for that<br/>once, and so at it they all went again, more fiercely than<br/>ever.<br/><br/>The extraordinary upshot of this adventure was—but we have not<br/>decided yet that this is the adventure we are to narrate. Perhaps a<br/>better one would be the night attack by the redskins on the house<br/>under the ground, when several of them stuck in the hollow trees<br/>and had to be pulled out like corks. Or we might tell how Peter<br/>saved Tiger Lily's life in the Mermaids' Lagoon, and so made her<br/>his ally.<br/><br/>
