Now Smee had found the tom-tom, and was at that moment sitting
on it. "You will never hear the tom-tom again," he muttered, but
inaudibly of course, for strict silence had been enjoined [urged].
To his amazement Hook signed him to beat the tom-tom, and slowly
there came to Smee an understanding of the dreadful wickedness of
the order. Never, probably, had this simple man admired Hook so
much.

Twice Smee beat upon the instrument, and then stopped to listen
gleefully.

"The tom-tom," the miscreants heard Peter cry; "an Indian
victory!"

The doomed children answered with a cheer that was music to the
black hearts above, and almost immediately they repeated their
good-byes to Peter. This puzzled the pirates, but all their other
feelings were swallowed by a base delight that the enemy were about
to come up the trees. They smirked at each other and rubbed their
hands. Rapidly and silently Hook gave his orders: one man to each
tree, and the others to arrange themselves in a line two yards
apart.
