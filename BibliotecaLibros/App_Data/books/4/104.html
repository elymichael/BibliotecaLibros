"I complain of Nibs."<br/><br/>"Oh dear, oh dear," cried Wendy, "I'm sure I sometimes think<br/>that spinsters are to be envied."<br/><br/>She told them to clear away, and sat down to her work-basket, a<br/>heavy load of stockings and every knee with a hole in it as<br/>usual.<br/><br/>"Wendy," remonstrated [scolded] Michael, "I'm too big for a<br/>cradle."<br/><br/>"I must have somebody in a cradle," she said almost tartly, "and<br/>you are the littlest. A cradle is such a nice homely thing to have<br/>about a house."<br/><br/>While she sewed they played around her; such a group of happy<br/>faces and dancing limbs lit up by that romantic fire. It had become<br/>a very familiar scene, this, in the home under the ground, but we<br/>are looking on it for the last time.<br/><br/>There was a step above, and Wendy, you may be sure, was the<br/>first to recognize it.<br/><br/>"Children, I hear your father's step. He likes you to meet him<br/>at the door."<br/><br/>Above, the redskins crouched before Peter.<br/><br/>"Watch well, braves. I have spoken."<br/><br/>And then, as so often before, the gay children dragged him from<br/>his tree. As so often before, but never again.<br/>
