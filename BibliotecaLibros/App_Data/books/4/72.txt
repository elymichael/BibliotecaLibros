And roof of mossy green."


They gurgled with joy at this, for by the greatest good luck the
branches they had brought were sticky with red sap, and all the
ground was carpeted with moss. As they rattled up the little house
they broke into song themselves:


"We've built the little walls and roof
And made a lovely door,
So tell us, mother Wendy,
What are you wanting more?"


To this she answered greedily:


"Oh, really next I think I'll have
Gay windows all about,
With roses peeping in, you know,
And babies peeping out."
