<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>14<br/>THE PIRATE SHIP<br/><br/><br/>One green light squinting over Kidd's Creek, which is near the<br/>mouth of the pirate river, marked where the brig, the JOLLY ROGER,<br/>lay, low in the water; a rakish-looking [speedy-looking] craft foul<br/>to the hull, every beam in her detestable, like ground strewn with<br/>mangled feathers. She was the cannibal of the seas, and scarce<br/>needed that watchful eye, for she floated immune in the horror of<br/>her name.<br/><br/>She was wrapped in the blanket of night, through which no sound<br/>from her could have reached the shore. There was little sound, and<br/>none agreeable save the whir of the ship's sewing machine at which<br/>Smee sat, ever industrious and obliging, the essence of the<br/>commonplace, pathetic Smee. I know not why he was so infinitely<br/>pathetic, unless it were because he was so pathetically unaware of<br/>it; but even strong men had to turn hastily from looking at him,<br/>and more than once on summer evenings he had touched the fount of<br/>Hook's tears and made it flow. Of this, as of almost everything<br/>else, Smee was quite unconscious.<br/><br/>A few of the pirates leant over the bulwarks, drinking in the<br/>miasma [putrid mist] of the night; others sprawled by barrels over<br/>games of dice and cards; and the exhausted four who had carried the<br/>little house lay prone on the deck, where even in their sleep they<br/>rolled skillfully to this side or that out of Hook's reach, lest he<br/>should claw them mechanically in passing.<br/><br/>Hook trod the deck in thought. O man unfathomable. It was his<br/>hour of triumph. Peter had been removed for ever from his path, and<br/>all the other boys were in the brig, about to walk the plank. It<br/>was his grimmest deed since the days when he had brought Barbecue<br/>to heel; and knowing as we do how vain a tabernacle is man, could<br/>we be surprised had he now paced the deck unsteadily, bellied out<br/>by the winds of his success?<br/><br/>But there was no elation in his gait, which kept pace with the<br/>action of his sombre mind. Hook was profoundly dejected.<br/><br/>He was often thus when communing with himself on board ship in<br/>the quietude of the night. It was because he was so terribly alone.<br/>This inscrutable man never felt more alone than when surrounded by<br/>his dogs. They were socially inferior to him.<br/><br/>Hook was not his true name. To reveal who he really was would<br/>even at this date set the country in a blaze; but as those who read<br/>between the lines must already have guessed, he had been at a<br/>famous public school; and its traditions still clung to him like<br/>garments, with which indeed they are largely concerned. Thus it was<br/>offensive to him even now to board a ship in the same dress in<br/>which he grappled [attacked] her, and he still adhered in his walk<br/>to the school's distinguished slouch. But above all he retained the<br/>passion for good form.<br/>
