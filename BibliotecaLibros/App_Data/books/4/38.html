In a tremble they opened the street door. Mr. Darling would have<br/>rushed upstairs, but Mrs. Darling signed him to go softly. She even<br/>tried to make her heart go softly.<br/><br/>Will they reach the nursery in time? If so, how delightful for<br/>them, and we shall all breathe a sigh of relief, but there will be<br/>no story. On the other hand, if they are not in time, I solemnly<br/>promise that it will all come right in the end.<br/><br/>They would have reached the nursery in time had it not been that<br/>the little stars were watching them. Once again the stars blew the<br/>window open, and that smallest star of all called out:<br/><br/>"Cave, Peter!"<br/><br/>Then Peter knew that there was not a moment to lose. "Come," he<br/>cried imperiously, and soared out at once into the night, followed<br/>by John and Michael and Wendy.<br/><br/>Mr. and Mrs. Darling and Nana rushed into the nursery too late.<br/>The birds were flown.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
