Now Wendy understood. The real Hook was also in the water.<br/><br/>He was swimming to the boat, and as his men showed a light to<br/>guide him he had soon reached them. In the light of the lantern<br/>Wendy saw his hook grip the boat's side; she saw his evil swarthy<br/>face as he rose dripping from the water, and, quaking, she would<br/>have liked to swim away, but Peter would not budge. He was tingling<br/>with life and also top-heavy with conceit. "Am I not a wonder, oh,<br/>I am a wonder!" he whispered to her, and though she thought so<br/>also, she was really glad for the sake of his reputation that no<br/>one heard him except herself.<br/><br/>He signed to her to listen.<br/><br/>The two pirates were very curious to know what had brought their<br/>captain to them, but he sat with his head on his hook in a position<br/>of profound melancholy.<br/><br/>"Captain, is all well?" they asked timidly, but he answered with<br/>a hollow moan.<br/><br/>"He sighs," said Smee.<br/><br/>"He sighs again," said Starkey.<br/><br/>"And yet a third time he sighs," said Smee.<br/><br/>Then at last he spoke passionately.<br/><br/>"The game's up," he cried, "those boys have found a mother."<br/><br/>Affrighted though she was, Wendy swelled with pride.<br/>
