<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>9<br/>THE NEVER BIRD<br/><br/><br/>The last sound Peter heard before he was quite alone were the<br/>mermaids retiring one by one to their bedchambers under the sea. He<br/>was too far away to hear their doors shut; but every door in the<br/>coral caves where they live rings a tiny bell when it opens or<br/>closes (as in all the nicest houses on the mainland), and he heard<br/>the bells.<br/><br/>Steadily the waters rose till they were nibbling at his feet;<br/>and to pass the time until they made their final gulp, he watched<br/>the only thing on the lagoon. He thought it was a piece of floating<br/>paper, perhaps part of the kite, and wondered idly how long it<br/>would take to drift ashore.<br/><br/>Presently he noticed as an odd thing that it was undoubtedly out<br/>upon the lagoon with some definite purpose, for it was fighting the<br/>tide, and sometimes winning; and when it won, Peter, always<br/>sympathetic to the weaker side, could not help clapping; it was<br/>such a gallant piece of paper.<br/><br/>It was not really a piece of paper; it was the Never bird,<br/>making desperate efforts to reach Peter on the nest. By working her<br/>wings, in a way she had learned since the nest fell into the water,<br/>she was able to some extent to guide her strange craft, but by the<br/>time Peter recognised her she was very exhausted. She had come to<br/>save him, to give him her nest, though there were eggs in it. I<br/>rather wonder at the bird, for though he had been nice to her, he<br/>had also sometimes tormented her. I can suppose only that, like<br/>Mrs. Darling and the rest of them, she was melted because he had<br/>all his first teeth.<br/><br/>She called out to him what she had come for, and he called out<br/>to her what she was doing there; but of course neither of them<br/>understood the other's language. In fanciful stories people can<br/>talk to the birds freely, and I wish for the moment I could pretend<br/>that this were such a story, and say that Peter replied<br/>intelligently to the Never bird; but truth is best, and I want to<br/>tell you only what really happened. Well, not only could they not<br/>understand each other, but they forgot their manners.<br/><br/>"I—want—you—to—get—into—the—nest," the bird called, speaking as<br/>slowly and distinctly as possible, "and—then—you—can—drift—ashore,<br/>but—I—am—too—tired—to—bring—it—any—nearer—so—you—must—try<br/>to—swim—to—it."<br/><br/>"What are you quacking about?" Peter answered. "Why don't you<br/>let the nest drift as usual?"<br/>
