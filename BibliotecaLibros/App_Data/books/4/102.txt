"Sit in father's chair, John!" Wendy was scandalised. "Certainly
not."

"He is not really our father," John answered. "He didn't even
know how a father does till I showed him."

This was grumbling. "We complain of John," cried the twins.

Tootles held up his hand. He was so much the humblest of them,
indeed he was the only humble one, that Wendy was specially gentle
with him.

"I don't suppose," Tootles said diffidently [bashfully or
timidly], "that I could be father."

"No, Tootles."

Once Tootles began, which was not very often, he had a silly way
of going on.

"As I can't be father," he said heavily, "I don't suppose,
Michael, you would let me be baby?"

"No, I won't," Michael rapped out. He was already in his
basket.

"As I can't be baby," Tootles said, getting heavier and heavier
and heavier, "do you think I could be a twin?"

"No, indeed," replied the twins; "it's awfully difficult to be a
twin."
