"Ay, and the sound would have brought Tiger Lily's redskins upon
us. Do you want to lose your scalp?"

"Shall I after him, Captain," asked pathetic Smee, "and tickle
him with Johnny Corkscrew?" Smee had pleasant names for everything,
and his cutlass was Johnny Corkscrew, because he wiggled it in the
wound. One could mention many lovable traits in Smee. For instance,
after killing, it was his spectacles he wiped instead of his
weapon.

"Johnny's a silent fellow," he reminded Hook.

"Not now, Smee," Hook said darkly. "He is only one, and I want
to mischief all the seven. Scatter and look for them."

The pirates disappeared among the trees, and in a moment their
Captain and Smee were alone. Hook heaved a heavy sigh, and I know
not why it was, perhaps it was because of the soft beauty of the
evening, but there came over him a desire to confide to his
faithful bo'sun the story of his life. He spoke long and earnestly,
but what it was all about Smee, who was rather stupid, did not know
in the least.

Anon [later] he caught the word Peter.

"Most of all," Hook was saying passionately, "I want their
captain, Peter Pan. 'Twas he cut off my arm." He brandished the
hook threateningly. "I've waited long to shake his hand with this.
Oh, I'll tear him!"

"And yet," said Smee, "I have often heard you say that hook was
worth a score of hands, for combing the hair and other homely
uses."

"Ay," the captain answered, "if I was a mother I would pray to
have my children born with this instead of that," and he cast a
look of pride upon his iron hand and one of scorn upon the other.
Then again he frowned.

"Peter flung my arm," he said, wincing, "to a crocodile that
happened to be passing by."

"I have often," said Smee, "noticed your strange dread of
crocodiles."
