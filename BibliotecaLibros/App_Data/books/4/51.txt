When at last the heavens were steady again, John and Michael
found themselves alone in the darkness. John was treading the air
mechanically, and Michael without knowing how to float was
floating.

"Are you shot?" John whispered tremulously.

"I haven't tried [myself out] yet," Michael whispered back.

We know now that no one had been hit. Peter, however, had been
carried by the wind of the shot far out to sea, while Wendy was
blown upwards with no companion but Tinker Bell.

It would have been well for Wendy if at that moment she had
dropped the hat.

I don't know whether the idea came suddenly to Tink, or whether
she had planned it on the way, but she at once popped out of the
hat and began to lure Wendy to her destruction.

Tink was not all bad; or, rather, she was all bad just now, but,
on the other hand, sometimes she was all good. Fairies have to be
one thing or the other, because being so small they unfortunately
have room for one feeling only at a time. They are, however,
allowed to change, only it must be a complete change. At present
she was full of jealousy of Wendy. What she said in her lovely
tinkle Wendy could not of course understand, and I believe some of
it was bad words, but it sounded kind, and she flew back and
forward, plainly meaning "Follow me, and all will be well."

What else could poor Wendy do? She called to Peter and John and
Michael, and got only mocking echoes in reply. She did not yet know
that Tink hated her with the fierce hatred of a very woman. And so,
bewildered, and now staggering in her flight, she followed Tink to
her doom.
