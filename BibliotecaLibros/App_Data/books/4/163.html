<br/>"George!" Mrs. Darling exclaimed, pained to see her dear one<br/>showing himself in such an unfavourable light.<br/><br/>Then he burst into tears, and the truth came out. He was as glad<br/>to have them as she was, he said, but he thought they should have<br/>asked his consent as well as hers, instead of treating him as a<br/>cypher [zero] in his own house.<br/><br/>"I don't think he is a cypher," Tootles cried instantly. "Do you<br/>think he is a cypher, Curly?"<br/><br/>"No, I don't. Do you think he is a cypher, Slightly?"<br/><br/>"Rather not. Twin, what do you think?"<br/><br/>It turned out that not one of them thought him a cypher; and he<br/>was absurdly gratified, and said he would find space for them all<br/>in the drawing-room if they fitted in.<br/><br/>"We'll fit in, sir," they assured him.<br/><br/>"Then follow the leader," he cried gaily. "Mind you, I am not<br/>sure that we have a drawing-room, but we pretend we have, and it's<br/>all the same. Hoop la!"<br/><br/>He went off dancing through the house, and they all cried "Hoop<br/>la!" and danced after him, searching for the drawing-room; and I<br/>forget whether they found it, but at any rate they found corners,<br/>and they all fitted in.<br/><br/>As for Peter, he saw Wendy once again before he flew away. He<br/>did not exactly come to the window, but he brushed against it in<br/>passing so that she could open it if she liked and call to him.<br/>That is what she did.<br/><br/>
