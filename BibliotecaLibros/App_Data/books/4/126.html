<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>13<br/>DO YOU BELIEVE IN FAIRIES?<br/><br/><br/>The more quickly this horror is disposed of the better. The<br/>first to emerge from his tree was Curly. He rose out of it into the<br/>arms of Cecco, who flung him to Smee, who flung him to Starkey, who<br/>flung him to Bill Jukes, who flung him to Noodler, and so he was<br/>tossed from one to another till he fell at the feet of the black<br/>pirate. All the boys were plucked from their trees in this ruthless<br/>manner; and several of them were in the air at a time, like bales<br/>of goods flung from hand to hand.<br/><br/>A different treatment was accorded to Wendy, who came last. With<br/>ironical politeness Hook raised his hat to her, and, offering her<br/>his arm, escorted her to the spot where the others were being<br/>gagged. He did it with such an air, he was so frightfully DISTINGUE<br/>[imposingly distinguished], that she was too fascinated to cry out.<br/>She was only a little girl.<br/><br/>Perhaps it is tell-tale to divulge that for a moment Hook<br/>entranced her, and we tell on her only because her slip led to<br/>strange results. Had she haughtily unhanded him (and we should have<br/>loved to write it of her), she would have been hurled through the<br/>air like the others, and then Hook would probably not have been<br/>present at the tying of the children; and had he not been at the<br/>tying he would not have discovered Slightly's secret, and without<br/>the secret he could not presently have made his foul attempt on<br/>Peter's life.<br/><br/>They were tied to prevent their flying away, doubled up with<br/>their knees close to their ears; and for the trussing of them the<br/>black pirate had cut a rope into nine equal pieces. All went well<br/>until Slightly's turn came, when he was found to be like those<br/>irritating parcels that use up all the string in going round and<br/>leave no tags [ends] with which to tie a knot. The pirates kicked<br/>him in their rage, just as you kick the parcel (though in fairness<br/>you should kick the string); and strange to say it was Hook who<br/>told them to belay their violence. His lip was curled with<br/>malicious triumph. While his dogs were merely sweating because<br/>every time they tried to pack the unhappy lad tight in one part he<br/>bulged out in another, Hook's master mind had gone far beneath<br/>Slightly's surface, probing not for effects but for causes; and his<br/>exultation showed that he had found them. Slightly, white to the<br/>gills, knew that Hook had surprised [discovered] his secret, which<br/>was this, that no boy so blown out could use a tree wherein an<br/>average man need stick. Poor Slightly, most wretched of all the<br/>children now, for he was in a panic about Peter, bitterly regretted<br/>what he had done. Madly addicted to the drinking of water when he<br/>was hot, he had swelled in consequence to his present girth, and<br/>instead of reducing himself to fit his tree he had, unknown to the<br/>others, whittled his tree to make it fit him.<br/><br/>Sufficient of this Hook guessed to persuade him that Peter at<br/>last lay at his mercy, but no word of the dark design that now<br/>formed in the subterranean caverns of his mind crossed his lips; he<br/>merely signed that the captives were to be conveyed to the ship,<br/>and that he would be alone.<br/><br/>How to convey them? Hunched up in their ropes they might indeed<br/>be rolled down hill like barrels, but most of the way lay through a<br/>morass. Again Hook's genius surmounted difficulties. He indicated<br/>that the little house must be used as a conveyance. The children<br/>were flung into it, four stout pirates raised it on their<br/>shoulders, the others fell in behind, and singing the hateful<br/>pirate chorus the strange procession set off through the wood. I<br/>don't know whether any of the children were crying; if so, the<br/>singing drowned the sound; but as the little house disappeared in<br/>the forest, a brave though tiny jet of smoke issued from its<br/>chimney as if defying Hook.<br/><br/>Hook saw it, and it did Peter a bad service. It dried up any<br/>trickle of pity for him that may have remained in the pirate's<br/>infuriated breast.<br/>
