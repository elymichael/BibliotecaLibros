<br/>"Boy."<br/><br/>Then he had leapt into her arms. Such a little thing for Mr. and<br/>Mrs. Darling and Nana to recall now, but not so little if that was<br/>to be Michael's last night in the nursery.<br/><br/>They go on with their recollections.<br/><br/>"It was then that I rushed in like a tornado, wasn't it?" Mr.<br/>Darling would say, scorning himself; and indeed he had been like a<br/>tornado.<br/><br/>Perhaps there was some excuse for him. He, too, had been<br/>dressing for the party, and all had gone well with him until he<br/>came to his tie. It is an astounding thing to have to tell, but<br/>this man, though he knew about stocks and shares, had no real<br/>mastery of his tie. Sometimes the thing yielded to him without a<br/>contest, but there were occasions when it would have been better<br/>for the house if he had swallowed his pride and used a made-up<br/>tie.<br/><br/>This was such an occasion. He came rushing into the nursery with<br/>the crumpled little brute of a tie in his hand.<br/><br/>"Why, what is the matter, father dear?"<br/><br/>"Matter!" he yelled; he really yelled. "This tie, it will not<br/>tie." He became dangerously sarcastic. "Not round my neck! Round<br/>the bed-post! Oh yes, twenty times have I made it up round the<br/>bed-post, but round my neck, no! Oh dear no! begs to be<br/>excused!"<br/><br/>He thought Mrs. Darling was not sufficiently impressed, and he<br/>went on sternly, "I warn you of this, mother, that unless this tie<br/>is round my neck we don't go out to dinner to-night, and if I don't<br/>go out to dinner to-night, I never go to the office again, and if I<br/>don't go to the office again, you and I starve, and our children<br/>will be flung into the streets."<br/><br/>Even then Mrs. Darling was placid. "Let me try, dear," she said,<br/>and indeed that was what he had come to ask her to do, and with her<br/>nice cool hands she tied his tie for him, while the children stood<br/>around to see their fate decided. Some men would have resented her<br/>being able to do it so easily, but Mr. Darling had far too fine a<br/>nature for that; he thanked her carelessly, at once forgot his<br/>rage, and in another moment was dancing round the room with Michael<br/>on his back.<br/><br/>
