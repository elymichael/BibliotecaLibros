THE HAPPY HOME


One important result of the brush [with the pirates] on the
lagoon was that it made the redskins their friends. Peter had saved
Tiger Lily from a dreadful fate, and now there was nothing she and
her braves would not do for him. All night they sat above, keeping
watch over the home under the ground and awaiting the big attack by
the pirates which obviously could not be much longer delayed. Even
by day they hung about, smoking the pipe of peace, and looking
almost as if they wanted tit-bits to eat.

They called Peter the Great White Father, prostrating themselves
[lying down] before him; and he liked this tremendously, so that it
was not really good for him.

"The great white father," he would say to them in a very lordly
manner, as they grovelled at his feet, "is glad to see the
Piccaninny warriors protecting his wigwam from the pirates."

"Me Tiger Lily," that lovely creature would reply. "Peter Pan
save me, me his velly nice friend. Me no let pirates hurt him."

She was far too pretty to cringe in this way, but Peter thought
it his due, and he would answer condescendingly, "It is good. Peter
Pan has spoken."

Always when he said, "Peter Pan has spoken," it meant that they
must now shut up, and they accepted it humbly in that spirit; but
they were by no means so respectful to the other boys, whom they
looked upon as just ordinary braves. They said "How-do?" to them,
and things like that; and what annoyed the boys was that Peter
seemed to think this all right.

Secretly Wendy sympathised with them a little, but she was far
too loyal a housewife to listen to any complaints against father.
"Father knows best," she always said, whatever her private opinion
must be. Her private opinion was that the redskins should not call
her a squaw.
