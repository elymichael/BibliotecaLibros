<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>15<br/>"HOOK OR ME THIS TIME"<br/><br/><br/>Odd things happen to all of us on our way through life without<br/>our noticing for a time that they have happened. Thus, to take an<br/>instance, we suddenly discover that we have been deaf in one ear<br/>for we don't know how long, but, say, half an hour. Now such an<br/>experience had come that night to Peter. When last we saw him he<br/>was stealing across the island with one finger to his lips and his<br/>dagger at the ready. He had seen the crocodile pass by without<br/>noticing anything peculiar about it, but by and by he remembered<br/>that it had not been ticking. At first he thought this eerie, but<br/>soon concluded rightly that the clock had run down.<br/><br/>Without giving a thought to what might be the feelings of a<br/>fellow-creature thus abruptly deprived of its closest companion,<br/>Peter began to consider how he could turn the catastrophe to his<br/>own use; and he decided to tick, so that wild beasts should believe<br/>he was the crocodile and let him pass unmolested. He ticked<br/>superbly, but with one unforeseen result. The crocodile was among<br/>those who heard the sound, and it followed him, though whether with<br/>the purpose of regaining what it had lost, or merely as a friend<br/>under the belief that it was again ticking itself, will never be<br/>certainly known, for, like slaves to a fixed idea, it was a stupid<br/>beast.<br/><br/>Peter reached the shore without mishap, and went straight on,<br/>his legs encountering the water as if quite unaware that they had<br/>entered a new element. Thus many animals pass from land to water,<br/>but no other human of whom I know. As he swam he had but one<br/>thought: "Hook or me this time." He had ticked so long that he now<br/>went on ticking without knowing that he was doing it. Had he known<br/>he would have stopped, for to board the brig by help of the tick,<br/>though an ingenious idea, had not occurred to him.<br/><br/>On the contrary, he thought he had scaled her side as noiseless<br/>as a mouse; and he was amazed to see the pirates cowering from him,<br/>with Hook in their midst as abject as if he had heard the<br/>crocodile.<br/><br/>The crocodile! No sooner did Peter remember it than he heard the<br/>ticking. At first he thought the sound did come from the crocodile,<br/>and he looked behind him swiftly. They he realised that he was<br/>doing it himself, and in a flash he understood the situation. "How<br/>clever of me!" he thought at once, and signed to the boys not to<br/>burst into applause.<br/><br/>It was at this moment that Ed Teynte the quartermaster emerged<br/>from the forecastle and came along the deck. Now, reader, time what<br/>happened by your watch. Peter struck true and deep. John clapped<br/>his hands on the ill-fated pirate's mouth to stifle the dying<br/>groan. He fell forward. Four boys caught him to prevent the thud.<br/>Peter gave the signal, and the carrion was cast overboard. There<br/>was a splash, and then silence. How long has it taken?<br/><br/>"One!" (Slightly had begun to count.)<br/>
