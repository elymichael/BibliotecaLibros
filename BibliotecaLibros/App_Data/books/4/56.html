"Ay, and the sound would have brought Tiger Lily's redskins upon<br/>us. Do you want to lose your scalp?"<br/><br/>"Shall I after him, Captain," asked pathetic Smee, "and tickle<br/>him with Johnny Corkscrew?" Smee had pleasant names for everything,<br/>and his cutlass was Johnny Corkscrew, because he wiggled it in the<br/>wound. One could mention many lovable traits in Smee. For instance,<br/>after killing, it was his spectacles he wiped instead of his<br/>weapon.<br/><br/>"Johnny's a silent fellow," he reminded Hook.<br/><br/>"Not now, Smee," Hook said darkly. "He is only one, and I want<br/>to mischief all the seven. Scatter and look for them."<br/><br/>The pirates disappeared among the trees, and in a moment their<br/>Captain and Smee were alone. Hook heaved a heavy sigh, and I know<br/>not why it was, perhaps it was because of the soft beauty of the<br/>evening, but there came over him a desire to confide to his<br/>faithful bo'sun the story of his life. He spoke long and earnestly,<br/>but what it was all about Smee, who was rather stupid, did not know<br/>in the least.<br/><br/>Anon [later] he caught the word Peter.<br/><br/>"Most of all," Hook was saying passionately, "I want their<br/>captain, Peter Pan. 'Twas he cut off my arm." He brandished the<br/>hook threateningly. "I've waited long to shake his hand with this.<br/>Oh, I'll tear him!"<br/><br/>"And yet," said Smee, "I have often heard you say that hook was<br/>worth a score of hands, for combing the hair and other homely<br/>uses."<br/><br/>"Ay," the captain answered, "if I was a mother I would pray to<br/>have my children born with this instead of that," and he cast a<br/>look of pride upon his iron hand and one of scorn upon the other.<br/>Then again he frowned.<br/><br/>"Peter flung my arm," he said, wincing, "to a crocodile that<br/>happened to be passing by."<br/><br/>"I have often," said Smee, "noticed your strange dread of<br/>crocodiles."<br/>
