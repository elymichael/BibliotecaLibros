"Seems to me," growled John, "these are the only two things
worth doing."

Here he got a pinch, but not a loving one.

"If only one of us had a pocket," Peter said, "we could carry
her in it." However, they had set off in such a hurry that there
was not a pocket between the four of them.

He had a happy idea. John's hat!

Tink agreed to travel by hat if it was carried in the hand. John
carried it, though she had hoped to be carried by Peter. Presently
Wendy took the hat, because John said it struck against his knee as
he flew; and this, as we shall see, led to mischief, for Tinker
Bell hated to be under an obligation to Wendy.

In the black topper the light was completely hidden, and they
flew on in silence. It was the stillest silence they had ever
known, broken once by a distant lapping, which Peter explained was
the wild beasts drinking at the ford, and again by a rasping sound
that might have been the branches of trees rubbing together, but he
said it was the redskins sharpening their knives.

Even these noises ceased. To Michael the loneliness was
dreadful. "If only something would make a sound!" he cried.

As if in answer to his request, the air was rent by the most
tremendous crash he had ever heard. The pirates had fired Long Tom
at them.

The roar of it echoed through the mountains, and the echoes
seemed to cry savagely, "Where are they, where are they, where are
they?"

Thus sharply did the terrified three learn the difference
between an island of make-believe and the same island come
true.
