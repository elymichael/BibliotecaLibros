"Better for Hook," he cried, "if he had had less ambition!" It<br/>was in his darkest hours only that he referred to himself in the<br/>third person.<br/><br/>"No little children to love me!"<br/><br/>Strange that he should think of this, which had never troubled<br/>him before; perhaps the sewing machine brought it to his mind. For<br/>long he muttered to himself, staring at Smee, who was hemming<br/>placidly, under the conviction that all children feared him.<br/><br/>Feared him! Feared Smee! There was not a child on board the brig<br/>that night who did not already love him. He had said horrid things<br/>to them and hit them with the palm of his hand, because he could<br/>not hit with his fist, but they had only clung to him the more.<br/>Michael had tried on his spectacles.<br/><br/>To tell poor Smee that they thought him lovable! Hook itched to<br/>do it, but it seemed too brutal. Instead, he revolved this mystery<br/>in his mind: why do they find Smee lovable? He pursued the problem<br/>like the sleuth-hound that he was. If Smee was lovable, what was it<br/>that made him so? A terrible answer suddenly presented itselfâ€”"Good<br/>form?"<br/><br/>Had the bo'sun good form without knowing it, which is the best<br/>form of all?<br/><br/>He remembered that you have to prove you don't know you have it<br/>before you are eligible for Pop [an elite social club at Eton].<br/><br/>With a cry of rage he raised his iron hand over Smee's head; but<br/>he did not tear. What arrested him was this reflection:<br/><br/>"To claw a man because he is good form, what would that be?"<br/><br/>"Bad form!"<br/><br/>The unhappy Hook was as impotent [powerless] as he was damp, and<br/>he fell forward like a cut flower.<br/>
