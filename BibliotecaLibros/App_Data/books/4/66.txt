Wonderful to relate [tell], Wendy had raised her arm. Nibs bent
over her and listened reverently. "I think she said, 'Poor
Tootles,'" he whispered.

"She lives," Peter said briefly.

Slightly cried instantly, "The Wendy lady lives."

Then Peter knelt beside her and found his button. You remember
she had put it on a chain that she wore round her neck.

"See," he said, "the arrow struck against this. It is the kiss I
gave her. It has saved her life."

"I remember kisses," Slightly interposed quickly, "let me see
it. Ay, that's a kiss."

Peter did not hear him. He was begging Wendy to get better
quickly, so that he could show her the mermaids. Of course she
could not answer yet, being still in a frightful faint; but from
overhead came a wailing note.

"Listen to Tink," said Curly, "she is crying because the Wendy
lives."

Then they had to tell Peter of Tink's crime, and almost never
had they seen him look so stern.

"Listen, Tinker Bell," he cried, "I am your friend no more.
Begone from me for ever."

She flew on to his shoulder and pleaded, but he brushed her off.
Not until Wendy again raised her arm did he relent sufficiently to
say, "Well, not for ever, but for a whole week."
