<br/>"It is nobody I know," he said, examining it carefully, "but it<br/>does look a scoundrel."<br/><br/>"We were still discussing it, you remember," says Mr. Darling,<br/>"when Nana came in with Michael's medicine. You will never carry<br/>the bottle in your mouth again, Nana, and it is all my fault."<br/><br/>Strong man though he was, there is no doubt that he had behaved<br/>rather foolishly over the medicine. If he had a weakness, it was<br/>for thinking that all his life he had taken medicine boldly, and so<br/>now, when Michael dodged the spoon in Nana's mouth, he had said<br/>reprovingly, "Be a man, Michael."<br/><br/>"Won't; won't!" Michael cried naughtily. Mrs. Darling left the<br/>room to get a chocolate for him, and Mr. Darling thought this<br/>showed want of firmness.<br/><br/>"Mother, don't pamper him," he called after her. "Michael, when<br/>I was your age I took medicine without a murmur. I said, 'Thank<br/>you, kind parents, for giving me bottles to make we well.'"<br/><br/>He really thought this was true, and Wendy, who was now in her<br/>night-gown, believed it also, and she said, to encourage Michael,<br/>"That medicine you sometimes take, father, is much nastier, isn't<br/>it?"<br/><br/>"Ever so much nastier," Mr. Darling said bravely, "and I would<br/>take it now as an example to you, Michael, if I hadn't lost the<br/>bottle."<br/><br/>He had not exactly lost it; he had climbed in the dead of night<br/>to the top of the wardrobe and hidden it there. What he did not<br/>know was that the faithful Liza had found it, and put it back on<br/>his wash-stand.<br/><br/>"I know where it is, father," Wendy cried, always glad to be of<br/>service. "I'll bring it," and she was off before he could stop her.<br/>Immediately his spirits sank in the strangest way.<br/><br/>"John," he said, shuddering, "it's most beastly stuff. It's that<br/>nasty, sticky, sweet kind."<br/><br/>
