"Why not both take it at the same<br/>time?"<br/><br/>"Certainly," said Mr. Darling. "Are you ready, Michael?"<br/><br/>Wendy gave the words, one, two, three, and Michael took his<br/>medicine, but Mr. Darling slipped his behind his back.<br/><br/>There was a yell of rage from Michael, and "O father!" Wendy<br/>exclaimed.<br/><br/>
