"No, you're not."<br/><br/>"Yes, and the little girl in the bed is my baby."<br/><br/>"No, she's not."<br/><br/>But he supposed she was; and he took a step towards the sleeping<br/>child with his dagger upraised. Of course he did not strike. He sat<br/>down on the floor instead and sobbed; and Wendy did not know how to<br/>comfort him, though she could have done it so easily once. She was<br/>only a woman now, and she ran out of the room to try to think.<br/><br/>Peter continued to cry, and soon his sobs woke Jane. She sat up<br/>in bed, and was interested at once.<br/><br/>"Boy," she said, "why are you crying?"<br/><br/>Peter rose and bowed to her, and she bowed to him from the<br/>bed.<br/><br/>"Hullo," he said.<br/><br/>"Hullo," said Jane.<br/><br/>"My name is Peter Pan," he told her.<br/><br/>"Yes, I know."<br/>
