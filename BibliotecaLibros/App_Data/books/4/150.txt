"Now!" cried all the boys, but with a magnificent gesture Peter
invited his opponent to pick up his sword. Hook did so instantly,
but with a tragic feeling that Peter was showing good form.

Hitherto he had thought it was some fiend fighting him, but
darker suspicions assailed him now.

"Pan, who and what art thou?" he cried huskily.

"I'm youth, I'm joy," Peter answered at a venture, "I'm a little
bird that has broken out of the egg."

This, of course, was nonsense; but it was proof to the unhappy
Hook that Peter did not know in the least who or what he was, which
is the very pinnacle of good form.

"To't again," he cried despairingly.

He fought now like a human flail, and every sweep of that
terrible sword would have severed in twain any man or boy who
obstructed it; but Peter fluttered round him as if the very wind it
made blew him out of the danger zone. And again and again he darted
in and pricked.

Hook was fighting now without hope. That passionate breast no
longer asked for life; but for one boon it craved: to see Peter
show bad form before it was cold forever.

Abandoning the fight he rushed into the powder magazine and
fired it.

"In two minutes," he cried, "the ship will be blown to
pieces."
