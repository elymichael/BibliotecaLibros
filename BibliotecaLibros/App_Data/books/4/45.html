"What kind of adventure?" he asked cautiously.<br/><br/>"There's a pirate asleep in the pampas just beneath us," Peter<br/>told him. "If you like, we'll go down and kill him."<br/><br/>"I don't see him," John said after a long pause.<br/><br/>"I do."<br/><br/>"Suppose," John said, a little huskily, "he were to wake<br/>up."<br/><br/>Peter spoke indignantly. "You don't think I would kill him while<br/>he was sleeping! I would wake him first, and then kill him. That's<br/>the way I always do."<br/><br/>"I say! Do you kill many?"<br/><br/>"Tons."<br/><br/>John said "How ripping," but decided to have tea first. He asked<br/>if there were many pirates on the island just now, and Peter said<br/>he had never known so many.<br/><br/>"Who is captain now?"<br/><br/>"Hook," answered Peter, and his face became very stern as he<br/>said that hated word.<br/>
