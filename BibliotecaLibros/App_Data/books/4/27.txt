"Wendy," he whispered gleefully, "I do believe I shut her up in
the drawer!"

He let poor Tink out of the drawer, and she flew about the
nursery screaming with fury. "You shouldn't say such things," Peter
retorted. "Of course I'm very sorry, but how could I know you were
in the drawer?"

Wendy was not listening to him. "O Peter," she cried, "if she
would only stand still and let me see her!"

"They hardly ever stand still," he said, but for one moment
Wendy saw the romantic figure come to rest on the cuckoo clock. "O
the lovely!" she cried, though Tink's face was still distorted with
passion.

"Tink," said Peter amiably, "this lady says she wishes you were
her fairy."

Tinker Bell answered insolently.

"What does she say, Peter?"

He had to translate. "She is not very polite. She says you are a
great [huge] ugly girl, and that she is my fairy."

He tried to argue with Tink. "You know you can't be my fairy,
Tink, because I am an gentleman and you are a lady."

To this Tink replied in these words, "You silly ass," and
disappeared into the bathroom. "She is quite a common fairy," Peter
explained apologetically, "she is called Tinker Bell because she
mends the pots and kettles [tinker = tin worker]." [Similar to
"cinder" plus "elle" to get Cinderella]
