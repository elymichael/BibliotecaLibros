Was it not strange? She appealed to Tootles, quite the silliest
one.

Grandly, however, did Tootles respond. For that one moment he
dropped his silliness and spoke with dignity.

"I am just Tootles," he said, "and nobody minds me. But the
first who does not behave to Wendy like an English gentleman I will
blood him severely."

He drew back his hanger; and for that instant his sun was at
noon. The others held back uneasily. Then Peter returned, and they
saw at once that they would get no support from him. He would keep
no girl in the Neverland against her will.

"Wendy," he said, striding up and down, "I have asked the
redskins to guide you through the wood, as flying tires you
so."

"Thank you, Peter."

"Then," he continued, in the short sharp voice of one accustomed
to be obeyed, "Tinker Bell will take you across the sea. Wake her,
Nibs."

Nibs had to knock twice before he got an answer, though Tink had
really been sitting up in bed listening for some time.

"Who are you? How dare you? Go away," she cried.

"You are to get up, Tink," Nibs called, "and take Wendy on a
journey."

Of course Tink had been delighted to hear that Wendy was going;
but she was jolly well determined not to be her courier, and she
said so in still more offensive language. Then she pretended to be
asleep again.
