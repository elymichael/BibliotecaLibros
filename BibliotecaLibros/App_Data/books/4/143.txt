None too soon, Peter, every inch of him on tiptoe, vanished into
the cabin; for more than one pirate was screwing up his courage to
look round. They could hear each other's distressed breathing now,
which showed them that the more terrible sound had passed.

"It's gone, captain," Smee said, wiping off his spectacles.
"All's still again."

Slowly Hook let his head emerge from his ruff, and listened so
intently that he could have caught the echo of the tick. There was
not a sound, and he drew himself up firmly to his full height.

"Then here's to Johnny Plank!" he cried brazenly, hating the
boys more than ever because they had seen him unbend. He broke into
the villainous ditty:


"Yo ho, yo ho, the frisky plank,
You walks along it so,
Till it goes down and you goes down
To Davy Jones below!"


To terrorize the prisoners the more, though with a certain loss
of dignity, he danced along an imaginary plank, grimacing at them
as he sang; and when he finished he cried, "Do you want a touch of
the cat [o' nine tails] before you walk the plank?"

At that they fell on their knees. "No, no!" they cried so
piteously that every pirate smiled.

"Fetch the cat, Jukes," said Hook; "it's in the cabin."
