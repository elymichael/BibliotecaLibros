"Now I see," Curly said: "Peter was bringing her to us." He
threw himself sorrowfully on the ground.

"A lady to take care of us at last," said one of the twins, "and
you have killed her!"

They were sorry for him, but sorrier for themselves, and when he
took a step nearer them they turned from him.

Tootles' face was very white, but there was a dignity about him
now that had never been there before.

"I did it," he said, reflecting. "When ladies used to come to me
in dreams, I said, 'Pretty mother, pretty mother.' But when at last
she really came, I shot her."

He moved slowly away.

"Don't go," they called in pity.

"I must," he answered, shaking; "I am so afraid of Peter."

It was at this tragic moment that they heard a sound which made
the heart of every one of them rise to his mouth. They heard Peter
crow.

"Peter!" they cried, for it was always thus that he signalled
his return.
