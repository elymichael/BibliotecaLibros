<br/>In the meantime, we had found nothing of any value but the<br/>silver and the trinkets, and neither of these were in our way.<br/>Underneath there was an old boat-cloak, whitened with sea-salt on<br/>many a harbour-bar. My mother pulled it up with impatience, and<br/>there lay before us, the last things in the chest, a bundle tied up<br/>in oilcloth, and looking like papers, and a canvas bag that gave<br/>forth, at a touch, the jingle of gold.<br/><br/>"I'll show these rogues that I'm an honest woman," said my<br/>mother. "I'll have my dues, and not a farthing over. Hold Mrs.<br/>Crossley's bag." And she began to count over the amount of the<br/>captain's score from the sailor's bag into the one that I was<br/>holding.<br/><br/>It was a long, difficult business, for the coins were of all<br/>countries and sizes—doubloons, and louis d'ors, and guineas, and<br/>pieces of eight, and I know not what besides, all shaken together<br/>at random. The guineas, too, were about the scarcest, and it was<br/>with these only that my mother knew how to make her count.<br/><br/>When we were about half-way through, I suddenly put my hand upon<br/>her arm, for I had heard in the silent frosty air a sound that<br/>brought my heart into my mouth—the tap-tapping of the blind man's<br/>stick upon the frozen road. It drew nearer and nearer, while we sat<br/>holding our breath. Then it struck sharp on the inn door, and then<br/>we could hear the handle being turned and the bolt rattling as the<br/>wretched being tried to enter; and then there was a long time of<br/>silence both within and without. At last the tapping recommenced,<br/>and, to our indescribable joy and gratitude, died slowly away again<br/>until it ceased to be heard. "Mother," said I, "take the whole and<br/>let's be going," for I was sure the bolted door must have seemed<br/>suspicious and would bring the whole hornet's nest about our ears,<br/>though how thankful I was that I had bolted it, none could tell who<br/>had never met that terrible blind man.<br/><br/>But my mother, frightened as she was, would not consent to take<br/>a fraction more than was due to her and was obstinately unwilling<br/>to be content with less. It was not yet seven, she said, by a long<br/>way; she knew her rights and she would have them; and she was still<br/>arguing with me when a little low whistle sounded a good way off<br/>upon the hill. That was enough, and more than enough, for both of<br/>us.<br/><br/>"I'll take what I have," she said, jumping to her feet.<br/><br/>"And I'll take this to square the count," said I, picking up the<br/>oilskin packet.<br/><br/>Next moment we were both groping downstairs, leaving the candle<br/>by the empty chest; and the next we had opened the door and were in<br/>full retreat. We had not started a moment too soon. The fog was<br/>rapidly dispersing; already the moon shone quite clear on the high<br/>ground on either side; and it was only in the exact bottom of the<br/>dell and round the tavern door that a thin veil still hung unbroken<br/>to conceal the first steps of our escape. Far less than half-way to<br/>the hamlet, very little beyond the bottom of the hill, we must come<br/>forth into the moonlight. Nor was this all, for the sound of<br/>several footsteps running came already to our ears, and as we<br/>looked back in their direction, a light tossing to and fro and<br/>still rapidly advancing showed that one of the newcomers carried a<br/>lantern.<br/><br/>"My dear," said my mother suddenly, "take the money and run on.<br/>I am going to faint."<br/><br/>This was certainly the end for both of us, I thought. How I<br/>cursed the cowardice of the neighbours; how I blamed my poor mother<br/>for her honesty and her greed, for her past foolhardiness and<br/>present weakness! We were just at the little bridge, by good<br/>fortune; and I helped her, tottering as she was, to the edge of the<br/>bank, where, sure enough, she gave a sigh and fell on my shoulder.<br/>I do not know how I found the strength to do it at all, and I am<br/>afraid it was roughly done, but I managed to drag her down the bank<br/>and a little way under the arch. Farther I could not move her, for<br/>the bridge was too low to let me do more than crawl below it. So<br/>there we had to stay—my mother almost entirely exposed and both of<br/>us within earshot of the inn.<br/><br/>
