<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>2<br/>The First Blow<br/><br/><br/>I<br/>was so pleased at<br/>having given the slip to Long John that I began to enjoy myself and<br/>look around me with some interest on the strange land that I was<br/>in.<br/><br/>I had crossed a marshy tract full of willows, bulrushes, and<br/>odd, outlandish, swampy trees; and I had now come out upon the<br/>skirts of an open piece of undulating, sandy country, about a mile<br/>long, dotted with a few pines and a great number of contorted<br/>trees, not unlike the oak in growth, but pale in the foliage, like<br/>willows. On the far side of the open stood one of the hills, with<br/>two quaint, craggy peaks shining vividly in the sun.<br/><br/>I now felt for the first time the joy of exploration. The isle<br/>was uninhabited; my shipmates I had left behind, and nothing lived<br/>in front of me but dumb brutes and fowls. I turned hither and<br/>thither among the trees. Here and there were flowering plants,<br/>unknown to me; here and there I saw snakes, and one raised his head<br/>from a ledge of rock and hissed at me with a noise not unlike the<br/>spinning of a top. Little did I suppose that he was a deadly enemy<br/>and that the noise was the famous rattle.<br/><br/>Then I came to a long thicket of these oaklike trees—live, or<br/>evergreen, oaks, I heard afterwards they should be called—which<br/>grew low along the sand like brambles, the boughs curiously<br/>twisted, the foliage compact, like thatch. The thicket stretched<br/>down from the top of one of the sandy knolls, spreading and growing<br/>taller as it went, until it reached the margin of the broad, reedy<br/>fen, through which the nearest of the little rivers soaked its way<br/>into the anchorage. The marsh was steaming in the strong sun, and<br/>the outline of the Spy-glass trembled through the haze.<br/><br/>All at once there began to go a sort of bustle among the<br/>bulrushes; a wild duck flew up with a quack, another followed, and<br/>soon over the whole surface of the marsh a great cloud of birds<br/>hung screaming and circling in the air. I judged at once that some<br/>of my shipmates must be drawing near along the borders of the fen.<br/>Nor was I deceived, for soon I heard the very distant and low tones<br/>of a human voice, which, as I continued to give ear, grew steadily<br/>louder and nearer.<br/><br/>This put me in a great fear, and I crawled under cover of the<br/>nearest live-oak and squatted there, hearkening, as silent as a<br/>mouse.<br/><br/>
