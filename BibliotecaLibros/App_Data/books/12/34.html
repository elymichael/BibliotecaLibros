"Trelawney," said the doctor, "I'll go with you; and I'll go<br/>bail for it, so will Jim, and be a credit to the undertaking.<br/>There's only one man I'm afraid of."<br/><br/>"And who's that?" cried the squire. "Name the dog, sir!"<br/><br/>"You," replied the doctor; "for you cannot hold your tongue. We<br/>are not the only men who know of this paper. These fellows who<br/>attacked the inn tonight—bold, desperate blades, for sure—and the<br/>rest who stayed aboard that lugger, and more, I dare say, not far<br/>off, are, one and all, through thick and thin, bound that they'll<br/>get that money. We must none of us go alone till we get to sea. Jim<br/>and I shall stick together in the meanwhile; you'll take Joyce and<br/>Hunter when you ride to Bristol, and from first to last, not one of<br/>us must breathe a word of what we've found."<br/><br/>"Livesey," returned the squire, "you are always in the right of<br/>it. I'll be as silent as the grave."<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
