<br/>"Black Dog!" said he.<br/><br/>"And who else?" returned the other, getting more at his ease.<br/>"Black Dog as ever was, come for to see his old shipmate Billy, at<br/>the Admiral Benbow inn. Ah, Bill, Bill, we have seen a sight of<br/>times, us two, since I lost them two talons," holding up his<br/>mutilated hand.<br/><br/>"Now, look here," said the captain; "you've run me down; here I<br/>am; well, then, speak up; what is it?"<br/><br/>"That's you, Bill," returned Black Dog, "you're in the right of<br/>it, Billy. I'll have a glass of rum from this dear child here, as<br/>I've took such a liking to; and we'll sit down, if you please, and<br/>talk square, like old shipmates."<br/><br/>When I returned with the rum, they were already seated on either<br/>side of the captain's breakfast-table—Black Dog next to the door<br/>and sitting sideways so as to have one eye on his old shipmate and<br/>one, as I thought, on his retreat.<br/><br/>He bade me go and leave the door wide open. "None of your<br/>keyholes for me, sonny," he said; and I left them together and<br/>retired into the bar.<br/><br/>"For a long time, though I certainly did my best to listen, I<br/>could hear nothing but a low gattling; but at last the voices began<br/>to grow higher, and I could pick up a word or two, mostly oaths,<br/>from the captain.<br/><br/>"No, no, no, no; and an end of it!" he cried once. And again,<br/>"If it comes to swinging, swing all, say I."<br/><br/>Then all of a sudden there was a tremendous explosion of oaths<br/>and other noises—the chair and table went over in a lump, a clash<br/>of steel followed, and then a cry of pain, and the next instant I<br/>saw Black Dog in full flight, and the captain hotly pursuing, both<br/>with drawn cutlasses, and the former streaming blood from the left<br/>shoulder. Just at the door the captain aimed at the fugitive one<br/>last tremendous cut, which would certainly have split him to the<br/>chine had it not been intercepted by our big signboard of Admiral<br/>Benbow. You may see the notch on the lower side of the frame to<br/>this day.<br/><br/>That blow was the last of the battle. Once out upon the road,<br/>Black Dog, in spite of his wound, showed a wonderful clean pair of<br/>heels and disappeared over the edge of the hill in half a minute.<br/>The captain, for his part, stood staring at the signboard like a<br/>bewildered man. Then he passed his hand over his eyes several times<br/>and at last turned back into the house.<br/><br/>
