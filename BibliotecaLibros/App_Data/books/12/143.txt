1
In
the Enemy's Camp


T
he red glare of
the torch, lighting up the interior of the block house, showed me
the worst of my apprehensions realized. The pirates were in
possession of the house and stores: there was the cask of cognac,
there were the pork and bread, as before, and what tenfold
increased my horror, not a sign of any prisoner. I could only judge
that all had perished, and my heart smote me sorely that I had not
been there to perish with them.

There were six of the buccaneers, all told; not another man was
left alive. Five of them were on their feet, flushed and swollen,
suddenly called out of the first sleep of drunkenness. The sixth
had only risen upon his elbow; he was deadly pale, and the
blood-stained bandage round his head told that he had recently been
wounded, and still more recently dressed. I remembered the man who
had been shot and had run back among the woods in the great attack,
and doubted not that this was he.

The parrot sat, preening her plumage, on Long John's shoulder.
He himself, I thought, looked somewhat paler and more stern than I
was used to. He still wore the fine broadcloth suit in which he had
fulfilled his mission, but it was bitterly the worse for wear,
daubed with clay and torn with the sharp briers of the wood.

"So," said he, "here's Jim Hawkins, shiver my timbers! Dropped
in, like, eh? Well, come, I take that friendly."

And thereupon he sat down across the brandy cask and began to
fill a pipe.

"Give me a loan of the link, Dick," said he; and then, when he
had a good light, "That'll do, lad," he added; "stick the glim in
the wood heap; and you, gentlemen, bring yourselves to! You needn't
stand up for Mr. Hawkins; he'll excuse you, you may lay to that.
And so, Jim"—stopping the tobacco—"here you were, and quite a
pleasant surprise for poor old John. I see you were smart when
first I set my eyes on you, but this here gets away from me clean,
it do."
