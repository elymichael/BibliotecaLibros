<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>1<br/>How My Shore Adventure Began<br/><br/><br/>T<br/>he appearance of<br/>the island when I came on deck next morning was altogether changed.<br/>Although the breeze had now utterly ceased, we had made a great<br/>deal of way during the night and were now lying becalmed about half<br/>a mile to the south-east of the low eastern coast. Grey-coloured<br/>woods covered a large part of the surface. This even tint was<br/>indeed broken up by streaks of yellow sand-break in the lower<br/>lands, and by many tall trees of the pine family, out-topping the<br/>others—some singly, some in clumps; but the general colouring was<br/>uniform and sad. The hills ran up clear above the vegetation in<br/>spires of naked rock. All were strangely shaped, and the Spy-glass,<br/>which was by three or four hundred feet the tallest on the island,<br/>was likewise the strangest in configuration, running up sheer from<br/>almost every side and then suddenly cut off at the top like a<br/>pedestal to put a statue on.<br/><br/>The Hispaniola was rolling scuppers under in the ocean swell.<br/>The booms were tearing at the blocks, the rudder was banging to and<br/>fro, and the whole ship creaking, groaning, and jumping like a<br/>manufactory. I had to cling tight to the backstay, and the world<br/>turned giddily before my eyes, for though I was a good enough<br/>sailor when there was way on, this standing still and being rolled<br/>about like a bottle was a thing I never learned to stand without a<br/>qualm or so, above all in the morning, on an empty stomach.<br/><br/>Perhaps it was this—perhaps it was the look of the island, with<br/>its grey, melancholy woods, and wild stone spires, and the surf<br/>that we could both see and hear foaming and thundering on the steep<br/>beach—at least, although the sun shone bright and hot, and the<br/>shore birds were fishing and crying all around us, and you would<br/>have thought anyone would have been glad to get to land after being<br/>so long at sea, my heart sank, as the saying is, into my boots; and<br/>from the first look onward, I hated the very thought of Treasure<br/>Island.<br/><br/>We had a dreary morning's work before us, for there was no sign<br/>of any wind, and the boats had to be got out and manned, and the<br/>ship warped three or four miles round the corner of the island and<br/>up the narrow passage to the haven behind Skeleton Island. I<br/>volunteered for one of the boats, where I had, of course, no<br/>business. The heat was sweltering, and the men grumbled fiercely<br/>over their work. Anderson was in command of my boat, and instead of<br/>keeping the crew in order, he grumbled as loud as the worst.<br/><br/>"Well," he said with an oath, "it's not forever."<br/><br/>I thought this was a very bad sign, for up to that day the men<br/>had gone briskly and willingly about their business; but the very<br/>sight of the island had relaxed the cords of discipline.<br/><br/>
