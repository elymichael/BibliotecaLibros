"But," asked Dick, "when we do lay 'em athwart, what are we to<br/>do with 'em, anyhow?"<br/><br/>"There's the man for me!" cried the cook admiringly. "That's<br/>what I call business. Well, what would you think? Put 'em ashore<br/>like maroons? That would have been England's way. Or cut 'em down<br/>like that much pork? That would have been Flint's, or Billy<br/>Bones's."<br/><br/>"Billy was the man for that," said Israel. "'Dead men don't<br/>bite,' says he. Well, he's dead now hisself; he knows the long and<br/>short on it now; and if ever a rough hand come to port, it was<br/>Billy."<br/><br/>"Right you are," said Silver; "rough and ready. But mark you<br/>here, I'm an easy man—I'm quite the gentleman, says you; but this<br/>time it's serious. Dooty is dooty, mates. I give my vote—death.<br/>When I'm in Parlyment and riding in my coach, I don't want none of<br/>these sea-lawyers in the cabin a-coming home, unlooked for, like<br/>the devil at prayers. Wait is what I say; but when the time comes,<br/>why, let her rip!"<br/><br/>"John," cries the coxswain, "you're a man!"<br/><br/>"You'll say so, Israel when you see," said Silver. "Only one<br/>thing I claim—I claim Trelawney. I'll wring his calf's head off his<br/>body with these hands, Dick!" he added, breaking off. "You just<br/>jump up, like a sweet lad, and get me an apple, to wet my pipe<br/>like."<br/><br/>You may fancy the terror I was in! I should have leaped out and<br/>run for it if I had found the strength, but my limbs and heart<br/>alike misgave me. I heard Dick begin to rise, and then someone<br/>seemingly stopped him, and the voice of Hands exclaimed, "Oh, stow<br/>that! Don't you get sucking of that bilge, John. Let's have a go of<br/>the rum."<br/><br/>"Dick," said Silver, "I trust you. I've a gauge on the keg,<br/>mind. There's the key; you fill a pannikin and bring it up."<br/>Terrified as I was, I could not help thinking to myself that this<br/>must have been how Mr. Arrow got the strong waters that destroyed<br/>him.<br/><br/>Dick was gone but a little while, and during his absence Israel<br/>spoke straight on in the cook's ear. It was but a word or two that<br/>I could catch, and yet I gathered some important news, for besides<br/>other scraps that tended to the same purpose, this whole clause was<br/>audible: "Not another man of them'll jine." Hence there were still<br/>faithful men on board.<br/><br/>When Dick returned, one after another of the trio took the<br/>pannikin and drank—one "To luck," another with a "Here's to old<br/>Flint," and Silver himself saying, in a kind of song, "Here's to<br/>ourselves, and hold your luff, plenty of prizes and plenty of<br/>duff."<br/><br/>Just then a sort of brightness fell upon me in the barrel, and<br/>looking up, I found the moon had risen and was silvering the<br/>mizzen-top and shining white on the luff of the fore-sail; and<br/>almost at the same time the voice of the lookout shouted, "Land<br/>ho!"<br/>
