<br/>"Why?" I cried. "You were asking me just now about the dead.<br/>You've broken your trust; you've lived in sin and lies and blood;<br/>there's a man you killed lying at your feet this moment, and you<br/>ask me why! For God's mercy, Mr. Hands, that's why."<br/><br/>I spoke with a little heat, thinking of the bloody dirk he had<br/>hidden in his pocket and designed, in his ill thoughts, to end me<br/>with. He, for his part, took a great draught of the wine and spoke<br/>with the most unusual solemnity.<br/><br/>"For thirty years," he said, "I've sailed the seas and seen good<br/>and bad, better and worse, fair weather and foul, provisions<br/>running out, knives going, and what not. Well, now I tell you, I<br/>never seen good come o' goodness yet. Him as strikes first is my<br/>fancy; dead men don't bite; them's my views—amen, so be it. And<br/>now, you look here," he added, suddenly changing his tone, "we've<br/>had about enough of this foolery. The tide's made good enough by<br/>now. You just take my orders, Cap'n Hawkins, and we'll sail slap in<br/>and be done with it."<br/><br/>All told, we had scarce two miles to run; but the navigation was<br/>delicate, the entrance to this northern anchorage was not only<br/>narrow and shoal, but lay east and west, so that the schooner must<br/>be nicely handled to be got in. I think I was a good, prompt<br/>subaltern, and I am very sure that Hands was an excellent pilot,<br/>for we went about and about and dodged in, shaving the banks, with<br/>a certainty and a neatness that were a pleasure to behold.<br/><br/>Scarcely had we passed the heads before the land closed around<br/>us. The shores of North Inlet were as thickly wooded as those of<br/>the southern anchorage, but the space was longer and narrower and<br/>more like, what in truth it was, the estuary of a river. Right<br/>before us, at the southern end, we saw the wreck of a ship in the<br/>last stages of dilapidation. It had been a great vessel of three<br/>masts but had lain so long exposed to the injuries of the weather<br/>that it was hung about with great webs of dripping seaweed, and on<br/>the deck of it shore bushes had taken root and now flourished thick<br/>with flowers. It was a sad sight, but it showed us that the<br/>anchorage was calm.<br/><br/>"Now," said Hands, "look there; there's a pet bit for to beach a<br/>ship in. Fine flat sand, never a cat's paw, trees all around of it,<br/>and flowers a-blowing like a garding on that old ship."<br/><br/>"And once beached," I inquired, "how shall we get her off<br/>again?"<br/><br/>"Why, so," he replied: "you take a line ashore there on the<br/>other side at low water, take a turn about one of them big pines;<br/>bring it back, take a turn around the capstan, and lie to for the<br/>tide. Come high water, all hands take a pull upon the line, and off<br/>she comes as sweet as natur'. And now, boy, you stand by. We're<br/>near the bit now, and she's too much way on her. Starboard a<br/>little—so—steady—starboard—larboard a little—steady—steady!"<br/><br/>So he issued his commands, which I breathlessly obeyed, till,<br/>all of a sudden, he cried, "Now, my hearty, luff!" And I put the<br/>helm hard up, and the Hispaniola swung round rapidly and ran stem<br/>on for the low, wooded shore.<br/><br/>The excitement of these last manoeuvres had somewhat interfered<br/>with the watch I had kept hitherto, sharply enough, upon the<br/>coxswain. Even then I was still so much interested, waiting for the<br/>ship to touch, that I had quite forgot the peril that hung over my<br/>head and stood craning over the starboard bulwarks and watching the<br/>ripples spreading wide before the bows. I might have fallen without<br/>a struggle for my life had not a sudden disquietude seized upon me<br/>and made me turn my head. Perhaps I had heard a creak or seen his<br/>shadow moving with the tail of my eye; perhaps it was an instinct<br/>like a cat's; but, sure enough, when I looked round, there was<br/>Hands, already half-way towards me, with the dirk in his right<br/>hand.<br/><br/>
