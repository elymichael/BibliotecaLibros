<br/>In the meantime the captain, whom I had observed to be<br/>wonderfully swollen about the chest and pockets, had turned out a<br/>great many various stores—the British colours, a Bible, a coil of<br/>stoutish rope, pen, ink, the log-book, and pounds of tobacco. He<br/>had found a longish fir-tree lying felled and trimmed in the<br/>enclosure, and with the help of Hunter he had set it up at the<br/>corner of the log-house where the trunks crossed and made an angle.<br/>Then, climbing on the roof, he had with his own hand bent and run<br/>up the colours.<br/><br/>This seemed mightily to relieve him. He re-entered the log-house<br/>and set about counting up the stores as if nothing else existed.<br/>But he had an eye on Tom's passage for all that, and as soon as all<br/>was over, came forward with another flag and reverently spread it<br/>on the body.<br/><br/>"Don't you take on, sir," he said, shaking the squire's hand.<br/>"All's well with him; no fear for a hand that's been shot down in<br/>his duty to captain and owner. It mayn't be good divinity, but it's<br/>a fact."<br/><br/>Then he pulled me aside.<br/><br/>"Dr. Livesey," he said, "in how many weeks do you and squire<br/>expect the consort?"<br/><br/>I told him it was a question not of weeks but of months, that if<br/>we were not back by the end of August Blandly was to send to find<br/>us, but neither sooner nor later. "You can calculate for yourself,"<br/>I said.<br/><br/>"Why, yes," returned the captain, scratching his head; "and<br/>making a large allowance, sir, for all the gifts of Providence, I<br/>should say we were pretty close hauled."<br/><br/>"How do you mean?" I asked.<br/><br/>"It's a pity, sir, we lost that second load. That's what I<br/>mean," replied the captain. "As for powder and shot, we'll do. But<br/>the rations are short, very short—so short, Dr. Livesey, that we're<br/>perhaps as well without that extra mouth."<br/><br/>And he pointed to the dead body under the flag.<br/><br/>
