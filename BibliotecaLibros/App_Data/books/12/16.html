When I brought it to him, he seized it greedily and drank it<br/>out.<br/><br/>"Aye, aye," said he, "that's some better, sure enough. And now,<br/>matey, did that doctor say how long I was to lie here in this old<br/>berth?"<br/><br/>"A week at least," said I.<br/><br/>"Thunder!" he cried. "A week! I can't do that; they'd have the<br/>black spot on me by then. The lubbers is going about to get the<br/>wind of me this blessed moment; lubbers as couldn't keep what they<br/>got, and want to nail what is another's. Is that seamanly<br/>behaviour, now, I want to know? But I'm a saving soul. I never<br/>wasted good money of mine, nor lost it neither; and I'll trick 'em<br/>again. I'm not afraid on 'em. I'll shake out another reef, matey,<br/>and daddle 'em again."<br/><br/>As he was thus speaking, he had risen from bed with great<br/>difficulty, holding to my shoulder with a grip that almost made me<br/>cry out, and moving his legs like so much dead weight. His words,<br/>spirited as they were in meaning, contrasted sadly with the<br/>weakness of the voice in which they were uttered. He paused when he<br/>had got into a sitting position on the edge.<br/><br/>"That doctor's done me," he murmured. "My ears is singing. Lay<br/>me back."<br/><br/>Before I could do much to help him he had fallen back again to<br/>his former place, where he lay for a while silent.<br/><br/>"Jim," he said at length, "you saw that seafaring man<br/>today?"<br/><br/>"Black Dog?" I asked.<br/><br/>"Ah! Black Dog," says he. "He's a bad un; but there's worse that<br/>put him on. Now, if I can't get away nohow, and they tip me the<br/>black spot, mind you, it's my old sea-chest they're after; you get<br/>on a horse—you can, can't you? Well, then, you get on a horse, and<br/>go to—well, yes, I will!—to that eternal doctor swab, and tell him<br/>to pipe all hands—magistrates and sich—and he'll lay 'em aboard at<br/>the Admiral Benbow—all old Flint's crew, man and boy, all on 'em<br/>that's left. I was first mate, I was, old Flint's first mate, and<br/>I'm the on'y one as knows the place. He gave it me at Savannah,<br/>when he lay a-dying, like as if I was to now, you see. But you<br/>won't peach unless they get the black spot on me, or unless you see<br/>that Black Dog again or a seafaring man with one leg, Jim—him above<br/>all."<br/><br/>"But what is the black spot, captain?" I asked.<br/>
