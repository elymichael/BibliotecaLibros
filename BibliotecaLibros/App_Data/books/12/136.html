We must both have cried out aloud when our eyes met, but while<br/>mine was the shrill cry of terror, his was a roar of fury like a<br/>charging bully's. At the same instant, he threw himself forward and<br/>I leapt sideways towards the bows. As I did so, I let go of the<br/>tiller, which sprang sharp to leeward, and I think this saved my<br/>life, for it struck Hands across the chest and stopped him, for the<br/>moment, dead.<br/><br/>Before he could recover, I was safe out of the corner where he<br/>had me trapped, with all the deck to dodge about. Just forward of<br/>the main-mast I stopped, drew a pistol from my pocket, took a cool<br/>aim, though he had already turned and was once more coming directly<br/>after me, and drew the trigger. The hammer fell, but there followed<br/>neither flash nor sound; the priming was useless with sea-water. I<br/>cursed myself for my neglect. Why had not I, long before, reprimed<br/>and reloaded my only weapons? Then I should not have been as now, a<br/>mere fleeing sheep before this butcher.<br/><br/>Wounded as he was, it was wonderful how fast he could move, his<br/>grizzled hair tumbling over his face, and his face itself as red as<br/>a red ensign with his haste and fury. I had no time to try my other<br/>pistol, nor indeed much inclination, for I was sure it would be<br/>useless. One thing I saw plainly: I must not simply retreat before<br/>him, or he would speedily hold me boxed into the bows, as a moment<br/>since he had so nearly boxed me in the stern. Once so caught, and<br/>nine or ten inches of the blood-stained dirk would be my last<br/>experience on this side of eternity. I placed my palms against the<br/>main-mast, which was of a goodish bigness, and waited, every nerve<br/>upon the stretch.<br/><br/>Seeing that I meant to dodge, he also paused; and a moment or<br/>two passed in feints on his part and corresponding movements upon<br/>mine. It was such a game as I had often played at home about the<br/>rocks of Black Hill Cove, but never before, you may be sure, with<br/>such a wildly beating heart as now. Still, as I say, it was a boy's<br/>game, and I thought I could hold my own at it against an elderly<br/>seaman with a wounded thigh. Indeed my courage had begun to rise so<br/>high that I allowed myself a few darting thoughts on what would be<br/>the end of the affair, and while I saw certainly that I could spin<br/>it out for long, I saw no hope of any ultimate escape.<br/><br/>Well, while things stood thus, suddenly the Hispaniola struck,<br/>staggered, ground for an instant in the sand, and then, swift as a<br/>blow, canted over to the port side till the deck stood at an angle<br/>of forty-five degrees and about a puncheon of water splashed into<br/>the scupper holes and lay, in a pool, between the deck and<br/>bulwark.<br/><br/>We were both of us capsized in a second, and both of us rolled,<br/>almost together, into the scuppers, the dead red-cap, with his arms<br/>still spread out, tumbling stiffly after us. So near were we,<br/>indeed, that my head came against the coxswain's foot with a crack<br/>that made my teeth rattle. Blow and all, I was the first afoot<br/>again, for Hands had got involved with the dead body. The sudden<br/>canting of the ship had made the deck no place for running on; I<br/>had to find some new way of escape, and that upon the instant, for<br/>my foe was almost touching me. Quick as thought, I sprang into the<br/>mizzen shrouds, rattled up hand over hand, and did not draw a<br/>breath till I was seated on the cross-trees.<br/><br/>I had been saved by being prompt; the dirk had struck not half a<br/>foot below me as I pursued my upward flight; and there stood Israel<br/>Hands with his mouth open and his face upturned to mine, a perfect<br/>statue of surprise and disappointment.<br/><br/>Now that I had a moment to myself, I lost no time in changing<br/>the priming of my pistol, and then, having one ready for service,<br/>and to make assurance doubly sure, I proceeded to draw the load of<br/>the other and recharge it afresh from the beginning.<br/><br/>My new employment struck Hands all of a heap; he began to see<br/>the dice going against him, and after an obvious hesitation, he<br/>also hauled himself heavily into the shrouds, and with the dirk in<br/>his teeth, began slowly and painfully to mount. It cost him no end<br/>of time and groans to haul his wounded leg behind him, and I had<br/>quietly finished my arrangements before he was much more than a<br/>third of the way up. Then, with a pistol in either hand, I<br/>addressed him.<br/><br/>"One more step, Mr. Hands," said I, "and I'll blow your brains<br/>out! Dead men don't bite, you know," I added with a chuckle.<br/><br/>He stopped instantly. I could see by the working of his face<br/>that he was trying to think, and the process was so slow and<br/>laborious that, in my new-found security, I laughed aloud. At last,<br/>with a swallow or two, he spoke, his face still wearing the same<br/>expression of extreme perplexity. In order to speak he had to take<br/>the dagger from his mouth, but in all else he remained unmoved.<br/>
