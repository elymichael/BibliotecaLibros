"Who are you?" I asked.<br/><br/>"Ben Gunn," he answered, and his voice sounded hoarse and<br/>awkward, like a rusty lock. "I'm poor Ben Gunn, I am; and I haven't<br/>spoke with a Christian these three years."<br/><br/>I could now see that he was a white man like myself and that his<br/>features were even pleasing. His skin, wherever it was exposed, was<br/>burnt by the sun; even his lips were black, and his fair eyes<br/>looked quite startling in so dark a face. Of all the beggar-men<br/>that I had seen or fancied, he was the chief for raggedness. He was<br/>clothed with tatters of old ship's canvas and old sea-cloth, and<br/>this extraordinary patchwork was all held together by a system of<br/>the most various and incongruous fastenings, brass buttons, bits of<br/>stick, and loops of tarry gaskin. About his waist he wore an old<br/>brass-buckled leather belt, which was the one thing solid in his<br/>whole accoutrement.<br/><br/>"Three years!" I cried. "Were you shipwrecked?"<br/><br/>"Nay, mate," said he; "marooned."<br/><br/>I had heard the word, and I knew it stood for a horrible kind of<br/>punishment common enough among the buccaneers, in which the<br/>offender is put ashore with a little powder and shot and left<br/>behind on some desolate and distant island.<br/><br/>"Marooned three years agone," he continued, "and lived on goats<br/>since then, and berries, and oysters. Wherever a man is, says I, a<br/>man can do for himself. But, mate, my heart is sore for Christian<br/>diet. You mightn't happen to have a piece of cheese about you, now?<br/>No? Well, many's the long night I've dreamed of cheese—toasted,<br/>mostly—and woke up again, and here I were." "If ever I can get<br/>aboard again," said I, "you shall have cheese by the stone."<br/><br/>All this time he had been feeling the stuff of my jacket,<br/>smoothing my hands, looking at my boots, and generally, in the<br/>intervals of his speech, showing a childish pleasure in the<br/>presence of a fellow creature. But at my last words he perked up<br/>into a kind of startled slyness.<br/><br/>"If ever you can get aboard again, says you?" he repeated. "Why,<br/>now, who's to hinder you?"<br/><br/>"Not you, I know," was my reply.<br/><br/>"And right you was," he cried. "Now you—what do you call<br/>yourself, mate?"<br/>
