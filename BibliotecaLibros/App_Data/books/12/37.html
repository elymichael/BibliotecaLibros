<br/><br/>"Redruth," said I, interrupting the letter, "Dr. Livesey will<br/>not like that. The squire has been talking, after all."<br/><br/>"Well, who's a better right?" growled the gamekeeper. "A pretty<br/>rum go if squire ain't to talk for Dr. Livesey, I should<br/>think."<br/><br/>At that I gave up all attempts at commentary and read straight<br/>on:<br/><br/><br/>Blandly himself found the Hispaniola, and&#160;by the most<br/>admirable management got her for the&#160;merest trifle. There is a<br/>class of men in Bristol&#160;monstrously prejudiced against<br/>Blandly. They go&#160;the length of declaring that this honest<br/>creature&#160;would do anything for money, that the<br/>Hispaniola&#160;belonged to him, and that he sold it me<br/>absurdly&#160;high—the most transparent calumnies. None of<br/>them&#160;dare, however, to deny the merits of the ship.<br/><br/>Wo far there was not a hitch. The&#160;workpeople, to be<br/>sure—riggers and what not—were&#160;most annoyingly slow; but time<br/>cured that. It was&#160;the crew that troubled me.<br/><br/>I wished a round score of men—in case of&#160;natives,<br/>buccaneers, or the odious French—and I&#160;had the worry of the<br/>deuce itself to find so much&#160;as half a dozen, till the most<br/>remarkable stroke&#160;of fortune brought me the very man that<br/>I&#160;required.<br/><br/>I was standing on the dock, when, by the&#160;merest accident, I<br/>fell in talk with him. I found&#160;he was an old sailor, kept a<br/>public-house, knew&#160;all the seafaring men in Bristol, had lost<br/>his&#160;health ashore, and wanted a good berth as cook to&#160;get<br/>to sea again. He had hobbled down there that&#160;morning, he said,<br/>to get a smell of the salt.<br/><br/>I was monstrously touched—so would you have&#160;been—and, out<br/>of pure pity, I engaged him on the&#160;spot to be ship's cook.<br/>Long John Silver, he is&#160;called, and has lost a leg; but that I<br/>regarded as&#160;a recommendation, since he lost it in<br/>his&#160;country's service, under the immortal Hawke. He&#160;has<br/>no pension, Livesey. Imagine the abominable<br/><br/>age we live in!<br/><br/>
