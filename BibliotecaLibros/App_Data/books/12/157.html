The explosion of disapproval, which nothing but Silver's black<br/>looks had restrained, broke out immediately the doctor had left the<br/>house. Silver was roundly accused of playing double—of trying to<br/>make a separate peace for himself, of sacrificing the interests of<br/>his accomplices and victims, and, in one word, of the identical,<br/>exact thing that he was doing. It seemed to me so obvious, in this<br/>case, that I could not imagine how he was to turn their anger. But<br/>he was twice the man the rest were, and his last night's victory<br/>had given him a huge preponderance on their minds. He called them<br/>all the fools and dolts you can imagine, said it was necessary I<br/>should talk to the doctor, fluttered the chart in their faces,<br/>asked them if they could afford to break the treaty the very day<br/>they were bound a-treasure-hunting.<br/><br/>"No, by thunder!" he cried. "It's us must break the treaty when<br/>the time comes; and till then I'll gammon that doctor, if I have to<br/>ile his boots with brandy."<br/><br/>And then he bade them get the fire lit, and stalked out upon his<br/>crutch, with his hand on my shoulder, leaving them in a disarray,<br/>and silenced by his volubility rather than convinced.<br/><br/>"Slow, lad, slow," he said. "They might round upon us in a<br/>twinkle of an eye if we was seen to hurry."<br/><br/>Very deliberately, then, did we advance across the sand to where<br/>the doctor awaited us on the other side of the stockade, and as<br/>soon as we were within easy speaking distance Silver stopped.<br/><br/>"You'll make a note of this here also, doctor," says he, "and<br/>the boy'll tell you how I saved his life, and were deposed for it<br/>too, and you may lay to that. Doctor, when a man's steering as near<br/>the wind as me—playing chuck-farthing with the last breath in his<br/>body, like—you wouldn't think it too much, mayhap, to give him one<br/>good word? You'll please bear in mind it's not my life only<br/>now—it's that boy's into the bargain; and you'll speak me fair,<br/>doctor, and give me a bit o' hope to go on, for the sake of<br/>mercy."<br/><br/>Silver was a changed man once he was out there and had his back<br/>to his friends and the block house; his cheeks seemed to have<br/>fallen in, his voice trembled; never was a soul more dead in<br/>earnest.<br/><br/>"Why, John, you're not afraid?" asked Dr. Livesey.<br/><br/>"Doctor, I'm no coward; no, not I—not so much!" and he snapped<br/>his fingers. "If I was I wouldn't say it. But I'll own up fairly,<br/>I've the shakes upon me for the gallows. You're a good man and a<br/>true; I never seen a better man! And you'll not forget what I done<br/>good, not any more than you'll forget the bad, I know. And I step<br/>aside—see here—and leave you and Jim alone. And you'll put that<br/>down for me too, for it's a long stretch, is that!"<br/><br/>So saying, he stepped back a little way, till he was out of<br/>earshot, and there sat down upon a tree-stump and began to whistle,<br/>spinning round now and again upon his seat so as to command a<br/>sight, sometimes of me and the doctor and sometimes of his unruly<br/>ruffians as they went to and fro in the sand between the fire—which<br/>they were busy rekindling—and the house, from which they brought<br/>forth pork and bread to make the breakfast.<br/><br/>"So, Jim," said the doctor sadly, "here you are. As you have<br/>brewed, so shall you drink, my boy. Heaven knows, I cannot find it<br/>in my heart to blame you, but this much I will say, be it kind or<br/>unkind: when Captain Smollett was well, you dared not have gone<br/>off; and when he was ill and couldn't help it, by George, it was<br/>downright cowardly!"<br/>
