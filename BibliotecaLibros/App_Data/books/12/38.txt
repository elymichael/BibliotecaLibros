Well, sir, I thought I had only found a cook,&#160;but it was a
crew I had discovered. Between&#160;Silver and myself we got
together in a few days a&#160;company of the toughest old salts
imaginable—not&#160;pretty to look at, but fellows, by their faces,
of&#160;the most indomitable spirit. I declare we could&#160;fight
a frigate.&#160;Long John even got rid of two out of the
six&#160;or seven I had already engaged. He showed me in
a&#160;moment that they were just the sort of
fresh-water&#160;swabs we had to fear in an adventure of

importance.

I am in the most magnificent health and&#160;spirits, eating
like a bull, sleeping like a tree,&#160;yet I shall not enjoy a
moment till I hear my old&#160;tarpaulins tramping round the
capstan. Seaward,&#160;ho! Hang the treasure! It's the glory of the
sea&#160;that has turned my head. So now, Livesey, come&#160;post;
do not lose an hour, if you respect me.

Let young Hawkins go at once to see his&#160;mother, with
Redruth for a guard; and then both&#160;come full speed to
Bristol.

Postscript—I did not tell you that Blandly,&#160;who, by the
way, is to send a consort after us if&#160;we don't turn up by the
end of August, had found&#160;an admirable fellow for sailing
master—a stiff&#160;man, which I regret, but in all other respects
a&#160;treasure. Long John Silver unearthed a very&#160;competent
man for a mate, a man named Arrow. I&#160;have a boatswain who
pipes, Livesey; so things&#160;shall go man-o'-war fashion on board
the good ship&#160;Hispaniola.

I forgot to tell you that Silver is a man of&#160;substance; I
know of my own knowledge that he has&#160;a banker's account, which
has never been&#160;overdrawn. He leaves his wife to manage the
inn;&#160;and as she is a woman of colour, a pair of
old&#160;bachelors like you and I may be excused for&#160;guessing
that it is the wife, quite as much as the&#160;health, that sends
him back to roving.

P.P.S.—Hawkins may stay one night with his&#160;mother.
