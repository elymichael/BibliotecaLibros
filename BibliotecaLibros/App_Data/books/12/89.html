<br/>"Who's the best shot?" asked the captain.<br/><br/>"Mr. Trelawney, out and away," said I.<br/><br/>"Mr. Trelawney, will you please pick me off one of these men,<br/>sir? Hands, if possible," said the captain.<br/><br/>Trelawney was as cool as steel. He looked to the priming of his<br/>gun.<br/><br/>"Now," cried the captain, "easy with that gun, sir, or you'll<br/>swamp the boat. All hands stand by to trim her when he aims."<br/><br/>The squire raised his gun, the rowing ceased, and we leaned over<br/>to the other side to keep the balance, and all was so nicely<br/>contrived that we did not ship a drop.<br/><br/>They had the gun, by this time, slewed round upon the swivel,<br/>and Hands, who was at the muzzle with the rammer, was in<br/>consequence the most exposed. However, we had no luck, for just as<br/>Trelawney fired, down he stooped, the ball whistled over him, and<br/>it was one of the other four who fell.<br/><br/>The cry he gave was echoed not only by his companions on board<br/>but by a great number of voices from the shore, and looking in that<br/>direction I saw the other pirates trooping out from among the trees<br/>and tumbling into their places in the boats.<br/><br/>"Here come the gigs, sir," said I.<br/><br/>"Give way, then," cried the captain. "We mustn't mind if we<br/>swamp her now. If we can't get ashore, all's up."<br/><br/>
