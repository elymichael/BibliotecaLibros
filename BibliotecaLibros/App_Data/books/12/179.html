The bar silver and the arms still lie, for all that I know,<br/>where Flint buried them; and certainly they shall lie there for me.<br/>Oxen and wain-ropes would not bring me back again to that accursed<br/>island; and the worst dreams that ever I have are when I hear the<br/>surf booming about its coasts or start upright in bed with the<br/>sharp voice of Captain Flint still ringing in my ears: "Pieces of<br/>eight! Pieces of eight!"<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
