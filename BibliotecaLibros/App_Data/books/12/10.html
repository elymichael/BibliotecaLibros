I told him I did not know his mate Bill, and this was for a<br/>person who stayed in our house whom we called the captain. "Well,"<br/>said he, "my mate Bill would be called the captain, as like as not.<br/>He has a cut on one cheek and a mighty pleasant way with him,<br/>particularly in drink, has my mate Bill. We'll put it, for argument<br/>like, that your captain has a cut on one cheek—and we'll put it, if<br/>you like, that that cheek's the right one. Ah, well! I told you.<br/>Now, is my mate Bill in this here house?"<br/><br/>I told him he was out walking.<br/><br/>"Which way, sonny? Which way is he gone?"<br/><br/>And when I had pointed out the rock and told him how the captain<br/>was likely to return, and how soon, and answered a few other<br/>questions, "Ah," said he, "this'll be as good as drink to my mate<br/>Bill."<br/><br/>The expression of his face as he said these words was not at all<br/>pleasant, and I had my own reasons for thinking that the stranger<br/>was mistaken, even supposing he meant what he said. But it was no<br/>affair of mine, I thought; and besides, it was difficult to know<br/>what to do. The stranger kept hanging about just inside the inn<br/>door, peering round the corner like a cat waiting for a mouse. Once<br/>I stepped out myself into the road, but he immediately called me<br/>back, and as I did not obey quick enough for his fancy, a most<br/>horrible change came over his tallowy face, and he ordered me in<br/>with an oath that made me jump. As soon as I was back again he<br/>returned to his former manner, half fawning, half sneering, patted<br/>me on the shoulder, told me I was a good boy and he had taken quite<br/>a fancy to me. "I have a son of my own," said he, "as like you as<br/>two blocks, and he's all the pride of my 'art. But the great thing<br/>for boys is discipline, sonny—discipline. Now, if you had sailed<br/>along of Bill, you wouldn't have stood there to be spoke to<br/>twice—not you. That was never Bill's way, nor the way of sich as<br/>sailed with him. And here, sure enough, is my mate Bill, with a<br/>spy-glass under his arm, bless his old 'art, to be sure. You and<br/>me'll just go back into the parlour, sonny, and get behind the<br/>door, and we'll give Bill a little surprise—bless his 'art, I say<br/>again.<br/><br/>So saying, the stranger backed along with me into the parlour<br/>and put me behind him in the corner so that we were both hidden by<br/>the open door. I was very uneasy and alarmed, as you may fancy, and<br/>it rather added to my fears to observe that the stranger was<br/>certainly frightened himself. He cleared the hilt of his cutlass<br/>and loosened the blade in the sheath; and all the time we were<br/>waiting there he kept swallowing as if he felt what we used to call<br/>a lump in the throat.<br/><br/>At last in strode the captain, slammed the door behind him,<br/>without looking to the right or left, and marched straight across<br/>the room to where his breakfast awaited him.<br/><br/>"Bill," said the stranger in a voice that I thought he had tried<br/>to make bold and big.<br/><br/>The captain spun round on his heel and fronted us; all the brown<br/>had gone out of his face, and even his nose was blue; he had the<br/>look of a man who sees a ghost, or the evil one, or something<br/>worse, if anything can be; and upon my word, I felt sorry to see<br/>him all in a moment turn so old and sick.<br/><br/>"Come, Bill, you know me; you know an old shipmate, Bill,<br/>surely," said the stranger.<br/><br/>The captain made a sort of gasp.<br/>
