<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>1<br/>In<br/>the Enemy's Camp<br/><br/><br/>T<br/>he red glare of<br/>the torch, lighting up the interior of the block house, showed me<br/>the worst of my apprehensions realized. The pirates were in<br/>possession of the house and stores: there was the cask of cognac,<br/>there were the pork and bread, as before, and what tenfold<br/>increased my horror, not a sign of any prisoner. I could only judge<br/>that all had perished, and my heart smote me sorely that I had not<br/>been there to perish with them.<br/><br/>There were six of the buccaneers, all told; not another man was<br/>left alive. Five of them were on their feet, flushed and swollen,<br/>suddenly called out of the first sleep of drunkenness. The sixth<br/>had only risen upon his elbow; he was deadly pale, and the<br/>blood-stained bandage round his head told that he had recently been<br/>wounded, and still more recently dressed. I remembered the man who<br/>had been shot and had run back among the woods in the great attack,<br/>and doubted not that this was he.<br/><br/>The parrot sat, preening her plumage, on Long John's shoulder.<br/>He himself, I thought, looked somewhat paler and more stern than I<br/>was used to. He still wore the fine broadcloth suit in which he had<br/>fulfilled his mission, but it was bitterly the worse for wear,<br/>daubed with clay and torn with the sharp briers of the wood.<br/><br/>"So," said he, "here's Jim Hawkins, shiver my timbers! Dropped<br/>in, like, eh? Well, come, I take that friendly."<br/><br/>And thereupon he sat down across the brandy cask and began to<br/>fill a pipe.<br/><br/>"Give me a loan of the link, Dick," said he; and then, when he<br/>had a good light, "That'll do, lad," he added; "stick the glim in<br/>the wood heap; and you, gentlemen, bring yourselves to! You needn't<br/>stand up for Mr. Hawkins; he'll excuse you, you may lay to that.<br/>And so, Jim"—stopping the tobacco—"here you were, and quite a<br/>pleasant surprise for poor old John. I see you were smart when<br/>first I set my eyes on you, but this here gets away from me clean,<br/>it do."<br/><br/>
