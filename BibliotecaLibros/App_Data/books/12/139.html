He had pitched, as I have said, against the bulwarks, where he<br/>lay like some horrible, ungainly sort of puppet, life-size, indeed,<br/>but how different from life's colour or life's comeliness! In that<br/>position I could easily have my way with him, and as the habit of<br/>tragical adventures had worn off almost all my terror for the dead,<br/>I took him by the waist as if he had been a sack of bran and with<br/>one good heave, tumbled him overboard. He went in with a sounding<br/>plunge; the red cap came off and remained floating on the surface;<br/>and as soon as the splash subsided, I could see him and Israel<br/>lying side by side, both wavering with the tremulous movement of<br/>the water. O'Brien, though still quite a young man, was very bald.<br/>There he lay, with that bald head across the knees of the man who<br/>had killed him and the quick fishes steering to and fro over<br/>both.<br/><br/>I was now alone upon the ship; the tide had just turned. The sun<br/>was within so few degrees of setting that already the shadow of the<br/>pines upon the western shore began to reach right across the<br/>anchorage and fall in patterns on the deck. The evening breeze had<br/>sprung up, and though it was well warded off by the hill with the<br/>two peaks upon the east, the cordage had begun to sing a little<br/>softly to itself and the idle sails to rattle to and fro.<br/><br/>I began to see a danger to the ship. The jibs I speedily doused<br/>and brought tumbling to the deck, but the main-sail was a harder<br/>matter. Of course, when the schooner canted over, the boom had<br/>swung out-board, and the cap of it and a foot or two of sail hung<br/>even under water. I thought this made it still more dangerous; yet<br/>the strain was so heavy that I half feared to meddle. At last I got<br/>my knife and cut the halyards. The peak dropped instantly, a great<br/>belly of loose canvas floated broad upon the water, and since, pull<br/>as I liked, I could not budge the downhall, that was the extent of<br/>what I could accomplish. For the rest, the Hispaniola must trust to<br/>luck, like myself.<br/><br/>By this time the whole anchorage had fallen into shadowâ€”the last<br/>rays, I remember, falling through a glade of the wood and shining<br/>bright as jewels on the flowery mantle of the wreck. It began to be<br/>chill; the tide was rapidly fleeting seaward, the schooner settling<br/>more and more on her beam-ends.<br/><br/>I scrambled forward and looked over. It seemed shallow enough,<br/>and holding the cut hawser in both hands for a last security, I let<br/>myself drop softly overboard. The water scarcely reached my waist;<br/>the sand was firm and covered with ripple marks, and I waded ashore<br/>in great spirits, leaving the Hispaniola on her side, with her<br/>main-sail trailing wide upon the surface of the bay. About the same<br/>time, the sun went fairly down and the breeze whistled low in the<br/>dusk among the tossing pines.<br/><br/>At least, and at last, I was off the sea, nor had I returned<br/>thence empty-handed. There lay the schooner, clear at last from<br/>buccaneers and ready for our own men to board and get to sea again.<br/>I had nothing nearer my fancy than to get home to the stockade and<br/>boast of my achievements. Possibly I might be blamed a bit for my<br/>truantry, but the recapture of the Hispaniola was a clenching<br/>answer, and I hoped that even Captain Smollett would confess I had<br/>not lost my time.<br/><br/>So thinking, and in famous spirits, I began to set my face<br/>homeward for the block house and my companions. I remembered that<br/>the most easterly of the rivers which drain into Captain Kidd's<br/>anchorage ran from the two-peaked hill upon my left, and I bent my<br/>course in that direction that I might pass the stream while it was<br/>small. The wood was pretty open, and keeping along the lower spurs,<br/>I had soon turned the corner of that hill, and not long after waded<br/>to the mid-calf across the watercourse.<br/><br/>This brought me near to where I had encountered Ben Gunn, the<br/>maroon; and I walked more circumspectly, keeping an eye on every<br/>side. The dusk had come nigh hand completely, and as I opened out<br/>the cleft between the two peaks, I became aware of a wavering glow<br/>against the sky, where, as I judged, the man of the island was<br/>cooking his supper before a roaring fire. And yet I wondered, in my<br/>heart, that he should show himself so careless. For if I could see<br/>this radiance, might it not reach the eyes of Silver himself where<br/>he camped upon the shore among the marshes?<br/><br/>Gradually the night fell blacker; it was all I could do to guide<br/>myself even roughly towards my destination; the double hill behind<br/>me and the Spy-glass on my right hand loomed faint and fainter; the<br/>stars were few and pale; and in the low ground where I wandered I<br/>kept tripping among bushes and rolling into sandy pits.<br/><br/>Suddenly a kind of brightness fell about me. I looked up; a pale<br/>glimmer of moonbeams had alighted on the summit of the Spy-glass,<br/>and soon after I saw something broad and silvery moving low down<br/>behind the trees, and knew the moon had risen.<br/><br/>With this to help me, I passed rapidly over what remained to me<br/>of my journey, and sometimes walking, sometimes running,<br/>impatiently drew near to the stockade. Yet, as I began to thread<br/>the grove that lies before it, I was not so thoughtless but that I<br/>slacked my pace and went a trifle warily. It would have been a poor<br/>end of my adventures to get shot down by my own party in<br/>mistake.<br/>
