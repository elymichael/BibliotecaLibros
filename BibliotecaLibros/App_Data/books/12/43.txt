The man whom he called Morgan—an old, grey-haired,
mahogany-faced sailor—came forward pretty sheepishly, rolling his
quid.

"Now, Morgan," said Long John very sternly, "you never clapped
your eyes on that Black—Black Dog before, did you, now?"

"Not I, sir," said Morgan with a salute.

"You didn't know his name, did you?"

"No, sir."

"By the powers, Tom Morgan, it's as good for you!" exclaimed the
landlord. "If you had been mixed up with the like of that, you
would never have put another foot in my house, you may lay to that.
And what was he saying to you?"

"I don't rightly know, sir," answered Morgan.

"Do you call that a head on your shoulders, or a blessed
dead-eye?" cried Long John. "Don't rightly know, don't you! Perhaps
you don't happen to rightly know who you was speaking to, perhaps?
Come, now, what was he jawing—v'yages, cap'ns, ships? Pipe up! What
was it?"

"We was a-talkin' of keel-hauling," answered Morgan.

"Keel-hauling, was you? And a mighty suitable thing, too, and
you may lay to that. Get back to your place for a lubber, Tom."
