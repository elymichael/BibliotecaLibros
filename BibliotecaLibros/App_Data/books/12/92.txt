e made our best
speed across the strip of wood that now divided us from the
stockade, and at every step we took the voices of the buccaneers
rang nearer. Soon we could hear their footfalls as they ran and the
cracking of the branches as they breasted across a bit of
thicket.

I began to see we should have a brush for it in earnest and
looked to my priming.

"Captain," said I, "Trelawney is the dead shot. Give him your
gun; his own is useless."

They exchanged guns, and Trelawney, silent and cool as he had
been since the beginning of the bustle, hung a moment on his heel
to see that all was fit for service. At the same time, observing
Gray to be unarmed, I handed him my cutlass. It did all our hearts
good to see him spit in his hand, knit his brows, and make the
blade sing through the air. It was plain from every line of his
body that our new hand was worth his salt.

Forty paces farther we came to the edge of the wood and saw the
stockade in front of us. We struck the enclosure about the middle
of the south side, and almost at the same time, seven mutineers—Job
Anderson, the boatswain, at their head—appeared in full cry at the
southwestern corner.

They paused as if taken aback, and before they recovered, not
only the squire and I, but Hunter and Joyce from the block house,
had time to fire. The four shots came in rather a scattering
volley, but they did the business: one of the enemy actually fell,
and the rest, without hesitation, turned and plunged into the
trees.
