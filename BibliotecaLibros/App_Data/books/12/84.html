What particularly took my fancy was the spring. For though we<br/>had a good enough place of it in the cabin of the Hispaniola, with<br/>plenty of arms and ammunition, and things to eat, and excellent<br/>wines, there had been one thing overlooked—we had no water. I was<br/>thinking this over when there came ringing over the island the cry<br/>of a man at the point of death. I was not new to violent death—I<br/>have served his Royal Highness the Duke of Cumberland, and got a<br/>wound myself at Fontenoy—but I know my pulse went dot and carry<br/>one. "Jim Hawkins is gone," was my first thought.<br/><br/>It is something to have been an old soldier, but more still to<br/>have been a doctor. There is no time to dilly-dally in our work.<br/>And so now I made up my mind instantly, and with no time lost<br/>returned to the shore and jumped on board the jolly-boat.<br/><br/>By good fortune Hunter pulled a good oar. We made the water fly,<br/>and the boat was soon alongside and I aboard the schooner.<br/><br/>I found them all shaken, as was natural. The squire was sitting<br/>down, as white as a sheet, thinking of the harm he had led us to,<br/>the good soul! And one of the six forecastle hands was little<br/>better.<br/><br/>"There's a man," says Captain Smollett, nodding towards him,<br/>"new to this work. He came nigh-hand fainting, doctor, when he<br/>heard the cry. Another touch of the rudder and that man would join<br/>us."<br/><br/>I told my plan to the captain, and between us we settled on the<br/>details of its accomplishment.<br/><br/>We put old Redruth in the gallery between the cabin and the<br/>forecastle, with three or four loaded muskets and a mattress for<br/>protection. Hunter brought the boat round under the stern-port, and<br/>Joyce and I set to work loading her with powder tins, muskets, bags<br/>of biscuits, kegs of pork, a cask of cognac, and my invaluable<br/>medicine chest.<br/><br/>In the meantime, the squire and the captain stayed on deck, and<br/>the latter hailed the coxswain, who was the principal man<br/>aboard.<br/><br/>"Mr. Hands," he said, "here are two of us with a brace of<br/>pistols each. If any one of you six make a signal of any<br/>description, that man's dead."<br/><br/>They were a good deal taken aback, and after a little<br/>consultation one and all tumbled down the fore companion, thinking<br/>no doubt to take us on the rear. But when they saw Redruth waiting<br/>for them in the sparred galley, they went about ship at once, and a<br/>head popped out again on deck.<br/><br/>"Down, dog!" cries the captain.<br/>
