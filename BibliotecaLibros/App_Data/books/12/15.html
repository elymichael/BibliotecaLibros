<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>3<br/>The Black Spot<br/><br/><br/>A<br/>bout noon I<br/>stopped at the captain's door with some cooling drinks and<br/>medicines. He was lying very much as we had left him, only a little<br/>higher, and he seemed both weak and excited.<br/><br/>"Jim," he said, "you're the only one here that's worth anything,<br/>and you know I've been always good to you. Never a month but I've<br/>given you a silver fourpenny for yourself. And now you see, mate,<br/>I'm pretty low, and deserted by all; and Jim, you'll bring me one<br/>noggin of rum, now, won't you, matey?"<br/><br/>"The doctor—" I began.<br/><br/>But he broke in cursing the doctor, in a feeble voice but<br/>heartily. "Doctors is all swabs," he said; "and that doctor there,<br/>why, what do he know about seafaring men? I been in places hot as<br/>pitch, and mates dropping round with Yellow Jack, and the blessed<br/>land a-heaving like the sea with earthquakes—what to the doctor<br/>know of lands like that?—and I lived on rum, I tell you. It's been<br/>meat and drink, and man and wife, to me; and if I'm not to have my<br/>rum now I'm a poor old hulk on a lee shore, my blood'll be on you,<br/>Jim, and that doctor swab"; and he ran on again for a while with<br/>curses. "Look, Jim, how my fingers fidges," he continued in the<br/>pleading tone. "I can't keep 'em still, not I. I haven't had a drop<br/>this blessed day. That doctor's a fool, I tell you. If I don't have<br/>a drain o' rum, Jim, I'll have the horrors; I seen some on 'em<br/>already. I seen old Flint in the corner there, behind you; as plain<br/>as print, I seen him; and if I get the horrors, I'm a man that has<br/>lived rough, and I'll raise Cain. Your doctor hisself said one<br/>glass wouldn't hurt me. I'll give you a golden guinea for a noggin,<br/>Jim."<br/><br/>He was growing more and more excited, and this alarmed me for my<br/>father, who was very low that day and needed quiet; besides, I was<br/>reassured by the doctor's words, now quoted to me, and rather<br/>offended by the offer of a bribe.<br/><br/>"I want none of your money," said I, "but what you owe my<br/>father. I'll get you one glass, and no more."<br/><br/>
