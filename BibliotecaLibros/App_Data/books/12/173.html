<br/>And we set off at a great pace, sometimes plunging through the<br/>bushes to the chest.<br/><br/>I tell you, but Silver was anxious to keep up with us. The work<br/>that man went through, leaping on his crutch till the muscles of<br/>his chest were fit to burst, was work no sound man ever equalled;<br/>and so thinks the doctor. As it was, he was already thirty yards<br/>behind us and on the verge of strangling when we reached the brow<br/>of the slope.<br/><br/>"Doctor," he hailed, "see there! No hurry!"<br/><br/>Sure enough there was no hurry. In a more open part of the<br/>plateau, we could see the three survivors still running in the same<br/>direction as they had started, right for Mizzen-mast Hill. We were<br/>already between them and the boats; and so we four sat down to<br/>breathe, while Long John, mopping his face, came slowly up with<br/>us.<br/><br/>"Thank ye kindly, doctor," says he. "You came in in about the<br/>nick, I guess, for me and Hawkins. And so it's you, Ben Gunn!" he<br/>added. "Well, you're a nice one, to be sure."<br/><br/>"I'm Ben Gunn, I am," replied the maroon, wriggling like an eel<br/>in his embarrassment. "And," he added, after a long pause, "how do,<br/>Mr. Silver? Pretty well, I thank ye, says you."<br/><br/>"Ben, Ben," murmured Silver, "to think as you've done me!"<br/><br/>The doctor sent back Gray for one of the pick-axes deserted, in<br/>their flight, by the mutineers, and then as we proceeded leisurely<br/>downhill to where the boats were lying, related in a few words what<br/>had taken place. It was a story that profoundly interested Silver;<br/>and Ben Gunn, the half-idiot maroon, was the hero from beginning to<br/>end.<br/><br/>Ben, in his long, lonely wanderings about the island, had found<br/>the skeleton—it was he that had rifled it; he had found the<br/>treasure; he had dug it up (it was the haft of his pick-axe that<br/>lay broken in the excavation); he had carried it on his back, in<br/>many weary journeys, from the foot of the tall pine to a cave he<br/>had on the two-pointed hill at the north-east angle of the island,<br/>and there it had lain stored in safety since two months before the<br/>arrival of the Hispaniola.<br/><br/>When the doctor had wormed this secret from him on the afternoon<br/>of the attack, and when next morning he saw the anchorage deserted,<br/>he had gone to Silver, given him the chart, which was now<br/>useless—given him the stores, for Ben Gunn's cave was well supplied<br/>with goats' meat salted by himself—given anything and everything to<br/>get a chance of moving in safety from the stockade to the<br/>two-pointed hill, there to be clear of malaria and keep a guard<br/>upon the money.<br/><br/>
