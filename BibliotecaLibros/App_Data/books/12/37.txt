"Redruth," said I, interrupting the letter, "Dr. Livesey will
not like that. The squire has been talking, after all."

"Well, who's a better right?" growled the gamekeeper. "A pretty
rum go if squire ain't to talk for Dr. Livesey, I should
think."

At that I gave up all attempts at commentary and read straight
on:


Blandly himself found the Hispaniola, and&#160;by the most
admirable management got her for the&#160;merest trifle. There is a
class of men in Bristol&#160;monstrously prejudiced against
Blandly. They go&#160;the length of declaring that this honest
creature&#160;would do anything for money, that the
Hispaniola&#160;belonged to him, and that he sold it me
absurdly&#160;high—the most transparent calumnies. None of
them&#160;dare, however, to deny the merits of the ship.

Wo far there was not a hitch. The&#160;workpeople, to be
sure—riggers and what not—were&#160;most annoyingly slow; but time
cured that. It was&#160;the crew that troubled me.

I wished a round score of men—in case of&#160;natives,
buccaneers, or the odious French—and I&#160;had the worry of the
deuce itself to find so much&#160;as half a dozen, till the most
remarkable stroke&#160;of fortune brought me the very man that
I&#160;required.

I was standing on the dock, when, by the&#160;merest accident, I
fell in talk with him. I found&#160;he was an old sailor, kept a
public-house, knew&#160;all the seafaring men in Bristol, had lost
his&#160;health ashore, and wanted a good berth as cook to&#160;get
to sea again. He had hobbled down there that&#160;morning, he said,
to get a smell of the salt.

I was monstrously touched—so would you have&#160;been—and, out
of pure pity, I engaged him on the&#160;spot to be ship's cook.
Long John Silver, he is&#160;called, and has lost a leg; but that I
regarded as&#160;a recommendation, since he lost it in
his&#160;country's service, under the immortal Hawke. He&#160;has
no pension, Livesey. Imagine the abominable

age we live in!
