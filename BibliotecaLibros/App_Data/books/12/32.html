"First of all we'll try the book," observed the doctor.<br/><br/>The squire and I were both peering over his shoulder as he<br/>opened it, for Dr. Livesey had kindly motioned me to come round<br/>from the side-table, where I had been eating, to enjoy the sport of<br/>the search. On the first page there were only some scraps of<br/>writing, such as a man with a pen in his hand might make for<br/>idleness or practice. One was the same as the tattoo mark, "Billy<br/>Bones his fancy"; then there was "Mr. W. Bones, mate," "No more<br/>rum," "Off Palm Key he got itt," and some other snatches, mostly<br/>single words and unintelligible. I could not help wondering who it<br/>was that had "got itt," and what "itt" was that he got. A knife in<br/>his back as like as not.<br/><br/>"Not much instruction there," said Dr. Livesey as he passed<br/>on.<br/><br/>The next ten or twelve pages were filled with a curious series<br/>of entries. There was a date at one end of the line and at the<br/>other a sum of money, as in common account-books, but instead of<br/>explanatory writing, only a varying number of crosses between the<br/>two. On the 12th of June, 1745, for instance, a sum of seventy<br/>pounds had plainly become due to someone, and there was nothing but<br/>six crosses to explain the cause. In a few cases, to be sure, the<br/>name of a place would be added, as "Offe Caraccas," or a mere entry<br/>of latitude and longitude, as "62o 17' 20", 19o 2' 40"."<br/><br/>The record lasted over nearly twenty years, the amount of the<br/>separate entries growing larger as time went on, and at the end a<br/>grand total had been made out after five or six wrong additions,<br/>and these words appended, "Bones, his pile."<br/><br/>"I can't make head or tail of this," said Dr. Livesey.<br/><br/>"The thing is as clear as noonday," cried the squire. "This is<br/>the black-hearted hound's account-book. These crosses stand for the<br/>names of ships or towns that they sank or plundered. The sums are<br/>the scoundrel's share, and where he feared an ambiguity, you see he<br/>added something clearer. 'Offe Caraccas,' now; you see, here was<br/>some unhappy vessel boarded off that coast. God help the poor souls<br/>that manned herâ€”coral long ago."<br/><br/>"Right!" said the doctor. "See what it is to be a traveller.<br/>Right! And the amounts increase, you see, as he rose in rank."<br/><br/>There was little else in the volume but a few bearings of places<br/>noted in the blank leaves towards the end and a table for reducing<br/>French, English, and Spanish moneys to a common value.<br/><br/>"Thrifty man!" cried the doctor. "He wasn't the one to be<br/>cheated."<br/><br/>"And now," said the squire, "for the other."<br/>
