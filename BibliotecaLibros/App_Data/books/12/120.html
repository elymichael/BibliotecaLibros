<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>2<br/>The Ebb-tide Runs<br/><br/><br/>T<br/>he coracle—as I<br/>had ample reason to know before I was done with her—was a very safe<br/>boat for a person of my height and weight, both buoyant and clever<br/>in a sea-way; but she was the most cross-grained, lop-sided craft<br/>to manage. Do as you pleased, she always made more leeway than<br/>anything else, and turning round and round was the manoeuvre she<br/>was best at. Even Ben Gunn himself has admitted that she was "queer<br/>to handle till you knew her way."<br/><br/>Certainly I did not know her way. She turned in every direction<br/>but the one I was bound to go; the most part of the time we were<br/>broadside on, and I am very sure I never should have made the ship<br/>at all but for the tide. By good fortune, paddle as I pleased, the<br/>tide was still sweeping me down; and there lay the Hispaniola right<br/>in the fairway, hardly to be missed.<br/><br/>First she loomed before me like a blot of something yet blacker<br/>than darkness, then her spars and hull began to take shape, and the<br/>next moment, as it seemed (for, the farther I went, the brisker<br/>grew the current of the ebb), I was alongside of her hawser and had<br/>laid hold.<br/><br/>The hawser was as taut as a bowstring, and the current so strong<br/>she pulled upon her anchor. All round the hull, in the blackness,<br/>the rippling current bubbled and chattered like a little mountain<br/>stream. One cut with my sea-gully and the Hispaniola would go<br/>humming down the tide.<br/><br/>So far so good, but it next occurred to my recollection that a<br/>taut hawser, suddenly cut, is a thing as dangerous as a kicking<br/>horse. Ten to one, if I were so foolhardy as to cut the Hispaniola<br/>from her anchor, I and the coracle would be knocked clean out of<br/>the water.<br/><br/>This brought me to a full stop, and if fortune had not again<br/>particularly favoured me, I should have had to abandon my design.<br/>But the light airs which had begun blowing from the south-east and<br/>south had hauled round after nightfall into the south-west. Just<br/>while I was meditating, a puff came, caught the Hispaniola, and<br/>forced her up into the current; and to my great joy, I felt the<br/>hawser slacken in my grasp, and the hand by which I held it dip for<br/>a second under water.<br/><br/>
