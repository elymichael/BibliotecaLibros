<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>1<br/>How My Sea Adventure Began<br/><br/><br/>T<br/>here was no return<br/>of the mutineers—not so much as another shot out of the woods. They<br/>had "got their rations for that day," as the captain put it, and we<br/>had the place to ourselves and a quiet time to overhaul the wounded<br/>and get dinner. Squire and I cooked outside in spite of the danger,<br/>and even outside we could hardly tell what we were at, for horror<br/>of the loud groans that reached us from the doctor's patients.<br/><br/>Out of the eight men who had fallen in the action, only three<br/>still breathed—that one of the pirates who had been shot at the<br/>loophole, Hunter, and Captain Smollett; and of these, the first two<br/>were as good as dead; the mutineer indeed died under the doctor's<br/>knife, and Hunter, do what we could, never recovered consciousness<br/>in this world. He lingered all day, breathing loudly like the old<br/>buccaneer at home in his apoplectic fit, but the bones of his chest<br/>had been crushed by the blow and his skull fractured in falling,<br/>and some time in the following night, without sign or sound, he<br/>went to his Maker.<br/><br/>As for the captain, his wounds were grievous indeed, but not<br/>dangerous. No organ was fatally injured. Anderson's ball—for it was<br/>Job that shot him first—had broken his shoulder-blade and touched<br/>the lung, not badly; the second had only torn and displaced some<br/>muscles in the calf. He was sure to recover, the doctor said, but<br/>in the meantime, and for weeks to come, he must not walk nor move<br/>his arm, nor so much as speak when he could help it.<br/><br/>My own accidental cut across the knuckles was a flea-bite.<br/>Doctor Livesey patched it up with plaster and pulled my ears for me<br/>into the bargain.<br/><br/>After dinner the squire and the doctor sat by the captain's side<br/>awhile in consultation; and when they had talked to their hearts'<br/>content, it being then a little past noon, the doctor took up his<br/>hat and pistols, girt on a cutlass, put the chart in his pocket,<br/>and with a musket over his shoulder crossed the palisade on the<br/>north side and set off briskly through the trees.<br/><br/>Gray and I were sitting together at the far end of the block<br/>house, to be out of earshot of our officers consulting; and Gray<br/>took his pipe out of his mouth and fairly forgot to put it back<br/>again, so thunder-struck he was at this occurrence.<br/><br/>
