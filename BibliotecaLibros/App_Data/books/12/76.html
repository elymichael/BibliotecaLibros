<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>3<br/>The Man of the Island<br/><br/><br/>F<br/>rom the side of<br/>the hill, which was here steep and stony, a spout of gravel was<br/>dislodged and fell rattling and bounding through the trees. My eyes<br/>turned instinctively in that direction, and I saw a figure leap<br/>with great rapidity behind the trunk of a pine. What it was,<br/>whether bear or man or monkey, I could in no wise tell. It seemed<br/>dark and shaggy; more I knew not. But the terror of this new<br/>apparition brought me to a stand.<br/><br/>I was now, it seemed, cut off upon both sides; behind me the<br/>murderers, before me this lurking nondescript. And immediately I<br/>began to prefer the dangers that I knew to those I knew not. Silver<br/>himself appeared less terrible in contrast with this creature of<br/>the woods, and I turned on my heel, and looking sharply behind me<br/>over my shoulder, began to retrace my steps in the direction of the<br/>boats.<br/><br/>Instantly the figure reappeared, and making a wide circuit,<br/>began to head me off. I was tired, at any rate; but had I been as<br/>fresh as when I rose, I could see it was in vain for me to contend<br/>in speed with such an adversary. From trunk to trunk the creature<br/>flitted like a deer, running manlike on two legs, but unlike any<br/>man that I had ever seen, stooping almost double as it ran. Yet a<br/>man it was, I could no longer be in doubt about that.<br/><br/>I began to recall what I had heard of cannibals. I was within an<br/>ace of calling for help. But the mere fact that he was a man,<br/>however wild, had somewhat reassured me, and my fear of Silver<br/>began to revive in proportion. I stood still, therefore, and cast<br/>about for some method of escape; and as I was so thinking, the<br/>recollection of my pistol flashed into my mind. As soon as I<br/>remembered I was not defenceless, courage glowed again in my heart<br/>and I set my face resolutely for this man of the island and walked<br/>briskly towards him.<br/><br/>He was concealed by this time behind another tree trunk; but he<br/>must have been watching me closely, for as soon as I began to move<br/>in his direction he reappeared and took a step to meet me. Then he<br/>hesitated, drew back, came forward again, and at last, to my wonder<br/>and confusion, threw himself on his knees and held out his clasped<br/>hands in supplication.<br/><br/>At that I once more stopped.<br/><br/>
