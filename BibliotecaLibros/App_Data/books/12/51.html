<br/>"Doctor," said the captain, "you are smart. When I came in here<br/>I meant to get discharged. I had no thought that Mr. Trelawney<br/>would hear a word."<br/><br/>"No more I would," cried the squire. "Had Livesey not been here<br/>I should have seen you to the deuce. As it is, I have heard you. I<br/>will do as you desire, but I think the worse of you."<br/><br/>"That's as you please, sir," said the captain. "You'll find I do<br/>my duty."<br/><br/>And with that he took his leave.<br/><br/>"Trelawney," said the doctor, "contrary to all my notions, I<br/>believed you have managed to get two honest men on board with<br/>youâ€”that man and John Silver."<br/><br/>"Silver, if you like," cried the squire; "but as for that<br/>intolerable humbug, I declare I think his conduct unmanly,<br/>unsailorly, and downright un-English."<br/><br/>"Well," says the doctor, "we shall see."<br/><br/>When we came on deck, the men had begun already to take out the<br/>arms and powder, yo-ho-ing at their work, while the captain and Mr.<br/>Arrow stood by superintending.<br/><br/>The new arrangement was quite to my liking. The whole schooner<br/>had been overhauled; six berths had been made astern out of what<br/>had been the after-part of the main hold; and this set of cabins<br/>was only joined to the galley and forecastle by a sparred passage<br/>on the port side. It had been originally meant that the captain,<br/>Mr. Arrow, Hunter, Joyce, the doctor, and the squire were to occupy<br/>these six berths. Now Redruth and I were to get two of them and Mr.<br/>Arrow and the captain were to sleep on deck in the companion, which<br/>had been enlarged on each side till you might almost have called it<br/>a round-house. Very low it was still, of course; but there was room<br/>to swing two hammocks, and even the mate seemed pleased with the<br/>arrangement. Even he, perhaps, had been doubtful as to the crew,<br/>but that is only guess, for as you shall hear, we had not long the<br/>benefit of his opinion.<br/><br/>We were all hard at work, changing the powder and the berths,<br/>when the last man or two, and Long John along with them, came off<br/>in a shore-boat.<br/><br/>
