"Then here goes!" said Morgan with an oath.<br/><br/>And he sprang up, drawing his knife as if he had been<br/>twenty.<br/><br/>"Avast, there!" cried Silver. "Who are you, Tom Morgan? Maybe<br/>you thought you was cap'n here, perhaps. By the powers, but I'll<br/>teach you better! Cross me, and you'll go where many a good man's<br/>gone before you, first and last, these thirty year back—some to the<br/>yard-arm, shiver my timbers, and some by the board, and all to feed<br/>the fishes. There's never a man looked me between the eyes and seen<br/>a good day a'terwards, Tom Morgan, you may lay to that."<br/><br/>Morgan paused, but a hoarse murmur rose from the others.<br/><br/>"Tom's right," said one.<br/><br/>"I stood hazing long enough from one," added another. "I'll be<br/>hanged if I'll be hazed by you, John Silver."<br/><br/>"Did any of you gentlemen want to have it out with me?" roared<br/>Silver, bending far forward from his position on the keg, with his<br/>pipe still glowing in his right hand. "Put a name on what you're<br/>at; you ain't dumb, I reckon. Him that wants shall get it. Have I<br/>lived this many years, and a son of a rum puncheon cock his hat<br/>athwart my hawse at the latter end of it? You know the way; you're<br/>all gentlemen o' fortune, by your account. Well, I'm ready. Take a<br/>cutlass, him that dares, and I'll see the colour of his inside,<br/>crutch and all, before that pipe's empty."<br/><br/>Not a man stirred; not a man answered.<br/><br/>"That's your sort, is it?" he added, returning his pipe to his<br/>mouth. "Well, you're a gay lot to look at, anyway. Not much worth<br/>to fight, you ain't. P'r'aps you can understand King George's<br/>English. I'm cap'n here by 'lection. I'm cap'n here because I'm the<br/>best man by a long sea-mile. You won't fight, as gentlemen o'<br/>fortune should; then, by thunder, you'll obey, and you may lay to<br/>it! I like that boy, now; I never seen a better boy than that. He's<br/>more a man than any pair of rats of you in this here house, and<br/>what I say is this: let me see him that'll lay a hand on him—that's<br/>what I say, and you may lay to it."<br/><br/>There was a long pause after this. I stood straight up against<br/>the wall, my heart still going like a sledge-hammer, but with a ray<br/>of hope now shining in my bosom. Silver leant back against the<br/>wall, his arms crossed, his pipe in the corner of his mouth, as<br/>calm as though he had been in church; yet his eye kept wandering<br/>furtively, and he kept the tail of it on his unruly followers.<br/>They, on their part, drew gradually together towards the far end of<br/>the block house, and the low hiss of their whispering sounded in my<br/>ear continuously, like a stream. One after another, they would look<br/>up, and the red light of the torch would fall for a second on their<br/>nervous faces; but it was not towards me, it was towards Silver<br/>that they turned their eyes.<br/><br/>"You seem to have a lot to say," remarked Silver, spitting far<br/>into the air. "Pipe up and let me hear it, or lay to."<br/>
