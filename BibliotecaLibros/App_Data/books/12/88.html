"If it's the only course that we can lie, sir, we must even lie<br/>it," returned the captain. "We must keep upstream. You see, sir,"<br/>he went on, "if once we dropped to leeward of the landing-place,<br/>it's hard to say where we should get ashore, besides the chance of<br/>being boarded by the gigs; whereas, the way we go the current must<br/>slacken, and then we can dodge back along the shore."<br/><br/>"The current's less a'ready, sir," said the man Gray, who was<br/>sitting in the fore-sheets; "you can ease her off a bit."<br/><br/>"Thank you, my man," said I, quite as if nothing had happened,<br/>for we had all quietly made up our minds to treat him like one of<br/>ourselves.<br/><br/>Suddenly the captain spoke up again, and I thought his voice was<br/>a little changed.<br/><br/>"The gun!" said he.<br/><br/>"I have thought of that," said I, for I made sure he was<br/>thinking of a bombardment of the fort. "They could never get the<br/>gun ashore, and if they did, they could never haul it through the<br/>woods."<br/><br/>"Look astern, doctor," replied the captain.<br/><br/>We had entirely forgotten the long nine; and there, to our<br/>horror, were the five rogues busy about her, getting off her<br/>jacket, as they called the stout tarpaulin cover under which she<br/>sailed. Not only that, but it flashed into my mind at the same<br/>moment that the round-shot and the powder for the gun had been left<br/>behind, and a stroke with an axe would put it all into the<br/>possession of the evil ones abroad.<br/><br/>"Israel was Flint's gunner," said Gray hoarsely.<br/><br/>At any risk, we put the boat's head direct for the<br/>landing-place. By this time we had got so far out of the run of the<br/>current that we kept steerage way even at our necessarily gentle<br/>rate of rowing, and I could keep her steady for the goal. But the<br/>worst of it was that with the course I now held we turned our<br/>broadside instead of our stern to the Hispaniola and offered a<br/>target like a barn door.<br/><br/>I could hear as well as see that brandy-faced rascal Israel<br/>Hands plumping down a round-shot on the deck.<br/>
