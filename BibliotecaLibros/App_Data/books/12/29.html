<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>6<br/>The Captain's Papers<br/><br/><br/>W<br/>e rode hard all<br/>the way till we drew up before Dr. Livesey's door. The house was<br/>all dark to the front.<br/><br/>Mr. Dance told me to jump down and knock, and Dogger gave me a<br/>stirrup to descend by. The door was opened almost at once by the<br/>maid.<br/><br/>"Is Dr. Livesey in?" I asked.<br/><br/>No, she said, he had come home in the afternoon but had gone up<br/>to the hall to dine and pass the evening with the squire. "So there<br/>we go, boys," said Mr. Dance.<br/><br/>This time, as the distance was short, I did not mount, but ran<br/>with Dogger's stirrup-leather to the lodge gates and up the long,<br/>leafless, moonlit avenue to where the white line of the hall<br/>buildings looked on either hand on great old gardens. Here Mr.<br/>Dance dismounted, and taking me along with him, was admitted at a<br/>word into the house.<br/><br/>The servant led us down a matted passage and showed us at the<br/>end into a great library, all lined with bookcases and busts upon<br/>the top of them, where the squire and Dr. Livesey sat, pipe in<br/>hand, on either side of a bright fire.<br/><br/>
