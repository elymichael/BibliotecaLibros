<br/>When we got to the inn, the squire and Dr. Livesey were seated<br/>together, finishing a quart of ale with a toast in it, before they<br/>should go aboard the schooner on a visit of inspection.<br/><br/>Long John told the story from first to last, with a great deal<br/>of spirit and the most perfect truth. "That was how it were, now,<br/>weren't it, Hawkins?" he would say, now and again, and I could<br/>always bear him entirely out.<br/><br/>The two gentlemen regretted that Black Dog had got away, but we<br/>all agreed there was nothing to be done, and after he had been<br/>complimented, Long John took up his crutch and departed.<br/><br/>"All hands aboard by four this afternoon," shouted the squire<br/>after him.<br/><br/>"Aye, aye, sir," cried the cook, in the passage.<br/><br/>"Well, squire," said Dr. Livesey, "I don't put much faith in<br/>your discoveries, as a general thing; but I will say this, John<br/>Silver suits me."<br/><br/>"The man's a perfect trump," declared the squire.<br/><br/>"And now," added the doctor, "Jim may come on board with us, may<br/>he not?"<br/><br/>"To be sure he may," says squire. "Take your hat, Hawkins, and<br/>we'll see the ship."<br/><br/><br/><br/>
