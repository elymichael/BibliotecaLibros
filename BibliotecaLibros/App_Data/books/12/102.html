<br/>I was dead tired, as you may fancy; and when I got to sleep,<br/>which was not till after a great deal of tossing, I slept like a<br/>log of wood.<br/><br/>The rest had long been up and had already breakfasted and<br/>increased the pile of firewood by about half as much again when I<br/>was wakened by a bustle and the sound of voices.<br/><br/>"Flag of truce!" I heard someone say; and then, immediately<br/>after, with a cry of surprise, "Silver himself!"<br/><br/>And at that, up I jumped, and rubbing my eyes, ran to a loophole<br/>in the wall.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
