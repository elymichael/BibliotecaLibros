"Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!"<br/><br/>And at the third "Ho!" drove the bars before them with a<br/>will.<br/><br/>Even at that exciting moment it carried me back to the old<br/>Admiral Benbow in a second, and I seemed to hear the voice of the<br/>captain piping in the chorus. But soon the anchor was short up;<br/>soon it was hanging dripping at the bows; soon the sails began to<br/>draw, and the land and shipping to flit by on either side; and<br/>before I could lie down to snatch an hour of slumber the Hispaniola<br/>had begun her voyage to the Isle of Treasure.<br/><br/>I am not going to relate that voyage in detail. It was fairly<br/>prosperous. The ship proved to be a good ship, the crew were<br/>capable seamen, and the captain thoroughly understood his business.<br/>But before we came the length of Treasure Island, two or three<br/>things had happened which require to be known.<br/><br/>Mr. Arrow, first of all, turned out even worse than the captain<br/>had feared. He had no command among the men, and people did what<br/>they pleased with him. But that was by no means the worst of it,<br/>for after a day or two at sea he began to appear on deck with hazy<br/>eye, red cheeks, stuttering tongue, and other marks of drunkenness.<br/>Time after time he was ordered below in disgrace. Sometimes he fell<br/>and cut himself; sometimes he lay all day long in his little bunk<br/>at one side of the companion; sometimes for a day or two he would<br/>be almost sober and attend to his work at least passably.<br/><br/>In the meantime, we could never make out where he got the drink.<br/>That was the ship's mystery. Watch him as we pleased, we could do<br/>nothing to solve it; and when we asked him to his face, he would<br/>only laugh if he were drunk, and if he were sober deny solemnly<br/>that he ever tasted anything but water.<br/><br/>He was not only useless as an officer and a bad influence<br/>amongst the men, but it was plain that at this rate he must soon<br/>kill himself outright, so nobody was much surprised, nor very<br/>sorry, when one dark night, with a head sea, he disappeared<br/>entirely and was seen no more.<br/><br/>"Overboard!" said the captain. "Well, gentlemen, that saves the<br/>trouble of putting him in irons."<br/><br/>But there we were, without a mate; and it was necessary, of<br/>course, to advance one of the men. The boatswain, Job Anderson, was<br/>the likeliest man aboard, and though he kept his old title, he<br/>served in a way as mate. Mr. Trelawney had followed the sea, and<br/>his knowledge made him very useful, for he often took a watch<br/>himself in easy weather. And the coxswain, Israel Hands, was a<br/>careful, wily, old, experienced seaman who could be trusted at a<br/>pinch with almost anything.<br/><br/>He was a great confidant of Long John Silver, and so the mention<br/>of his name leads me on to speak of our ship's cook, Barbecue, as<br/>the men called him.<br/><br/>Aboard ship he carried his crutch by a lanyard round his neck,<br/>to have both hands as free as possible. It was something to see him<br/>wedge the foot of the crutch against a bulkhead, and propped<br/>against it, yielding to every movement of the ship, get on with his<br/>cooking like someone safe ashore. Still more strange was it to see<br/>him in the heaviest of weather cross the deck. He had a line or two<br/>rigged up to help him across the widest spacesâ€”Long John's<br/>earrings, they were called; and he would hand himself from one<br/>place to another, now using the crutch, now trailing it alongside<br/>by the lanyard, as quickly as another man could walk. Yet some of<br/>the men who had sailed with him before expressed their pity to see<br/>him so reduced.<br/>
