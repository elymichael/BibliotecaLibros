<br/>It was fine open walking here, upon the summit; our way lay a<br/>little downhill, for, as I have said, the plateau tilted towards<br/>the west. The pines, great and small, grew wide apart; and even<br/>between the clumps of nutmeg and azalea, wide open spaces baked in<br/>the hot sunshine. Striking, as we did, pretty near north-west<br/>across the island, we drew, on the one hand, ever nearer under the<br/>shoulders of the Spy-glass, and on the other, looked ever wider<br/>over that western bay where I had once tossed and trembled in the<br/>oracle.<br/><br/>The first of the tall trees was reached, and by the bearings<br/>proved the wrong one. So with the second. The third rose nearly two<br/>hundred feet into the air above a clump of underwood—a giant of a<br/>vegetable, with a red column as big as a cottage, and a wide shadow<br/>around in which a company could have manoeuvred. It was conspicuous<br/>far to sea both on the east and west and might have been entered as<br/>a sailing mark upon the chart.<br/><br/>But it was not its size that now impressed my companions; it was<br/>the knowledge that seven hundred thousand pounds in gold lay<br/>somewhere buried below its spreading shadow. The thought of the<br/>money, as they drew nearer, swallowed up their previous terrors.<br/>Their eyes burned in their heads; their feet grew speedier and<br/>lighter; their whole soul was found up in that fortune, that whole<br/>lifetime of extravagance and pleasure, that lay waiting there for<br/>each of them.<br/><br/>Silver hobbled, grunting, on his crutch; his nostrils stood out<br/>and quivered; he cursed like a madman when the flies settled on his<br/>hot and shiny countenance; he plucked furiously at the line that<br/>held me to him and from time to time turned his eyes upon me with a<br/>deadly look. Certainly he took no pains to hide his thoughts, and<br/>certainly I read them like print. In the immediate nearness of the<br/>gold, all else had been forgotten: his promise and the doctor's<br/>warning were both things of the past, and I could not doubt that he<br/>hoped to seize upon the treasure, find and board the Hispaniola<br/>under cover of night, cut every honest throat about that island,<br/>and sail away as he had at first intended, laden with crimes and<br/>riches.<br/><br/>Shaken as I was with these alarms, it was hard for me to keep up<br/>with the rapid pace of the treasure-hunters. Now and again I<br/>stumbled, and it was then that Silver plucked so roughly at the<br/>rope and launched at me his murderous glances. Dick, who had<br/>dropped behind us and now brought up the rear, was babbling to<br/>himself both prayers and curses as his fever kept rising. This also<br/>added to my wretchedness, and to crown all, I was haunted by the<br/>thought of the tragedy that had once been acted on that plateau,<br/>when that ungodly buccaneer with the blue face—he who died at<br/>Savannah, singing and shouting for drink—had there, with his own<br/>hand, cut down his six accomplices. This grove that was now so<br/>peaceful must then have rung with cries, I thought; and even with<br/>the thought I could believe I heard it ringing still.<br/><br/>We were now at the margin of the thicket.<br/><br/>"Huzza, mates, all together!" shouted Merry; and the foremost<br/>broke into a run.<br/><br/>And suddenly, not ten yards further, we beheld them stop. A low<br/>cry arose. Silver doubled his pace, digging away with the foot of<br/>his crutch like one possessed; and next moment he and I had come<br/>also to a dead halt.<br/><br/>Before us was a great excavation, not very recent, for the sides<br/>had fallen in and grass had sprouted on the bottom. In this were<br/>the shaft of a pick broken in two and the boards of several<br/>packing-cases strewn around. On one of these boards I saw, branded<br/>with a hot iron, the name Walrus—the name of Flint's ship.<br/><br/>All was clear to probation. The cache had been found and rifled;<br/>the seven hundred thousand pounds were gone!<br/><br/>
