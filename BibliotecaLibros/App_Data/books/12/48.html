"Well, sir," said the captain, "better speak plain, I believe,<br/>even at the risk of offence. I don't like this cruise; I don't like<br/>the men; and I don't like my officer. That's short and sweet."<br/><br/>"Perhaps, sir, you don't like the ship?" inquired the squire,<br/>very angry, as I could see.<br/><br/>"I can't speak as to that, sir, not having seen her tried," said<br/>the captain. "She seems a clever craft; more I can't say."<br/>"Possibly, sir, you may not like your employer, either?" says the<br/>squire.<br/><br/>But here Dr. Livesey cut in.<br/><br/>"Stay a bit," said he, "stay a bit. No use of such questions as<br/>that but to produce ill feeling. The captain has said too much or<br/>he has said too little, and I'm bound to say that I require an<br/>explanation of his words. You don't, you say, like this cruise.<br/>Now, why?"<br/><br/>"I was engaged, sir, on what we call sealed orders, to sail this<br/>ship for that gentleman where he should bid me," said the captain.<br/>"So far so good. But now I find that every man before the mast<br/>knows more than I do. I don't call that fair, now, do you?"<br/><br/>"No," said Dr. Livesey, "I don't."<br/><br/>"Next," said the captain, "I learn we are going after<br/>treasure—hear it from my own hands, mind you. Now, treasure is<br/>ticklish work; I don't like treasure voyages on any account, and I<br/>don't like them, above all, when they are secret and when (begging<br/>your pardon, Mr. Trelawney) the secret has been told to the<br/>parrot."<br/><br/>"Silver's parrot?" asked the squire.<br/><br/>"It's a way of speaking," said the captain. "Blabbed, I mean.<br/>It's my belief neither of you gentlemen know what you are about,<br/>but I'll tell you my way of it—life or death, and a close run."<br/><br/>"That is all clear, and, I dare say, true enough," replied Dr.<br/>Livesey. "We take the risk, but we are not so ignorant as you<br/>believe us. Next, you say you don't like the crew. Are they not<br/>good seamen?"<br/>
