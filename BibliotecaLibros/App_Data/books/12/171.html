<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>6<br/>The Fall of a Chieftain<br/><br/><br/>T<br/>here never was<br/>such an overturn in this world. Each of these six men was as though<br/>he had been struck. But with Silver the blow passed almost<br/>instantly. Every thought of his soul had been set full-stretch,<br/>like a racer, on that money; well, he was brought up, in a single<br/>second, dead; and he kept his head, found his temper, and changed<br/>his plan before the others had had time to realize the<br/>disappointment.<br/><br/>"Jim," he whispered, "take that, and stand by for trouble."<br/><br/>And he passed me a double-barrelled pistol.<br/><br/>At the same time, he began quietly moving northward, and in a<br/>few steps had put the hollow between us two and the other five.<br/>Then he looked at me and nodded, as much as to say, "Here is a<br/>narrow corner," as, indeed, I thought it was. His looks were not<br/>quite friendly, and I was so revolted at these constant changes<br/>that I could not forbear whispering, "So you've changed sides<br/>again."<br/><br/>There was no time left for him to answer in. The buccaneers,<br/>with oaths and cries, began to leap, one after another, into the<br/>pit and to dig with their fingers, throwing the boards aside as<br/>they did so. Morgan found a piece of gold. He held it up with a<br/>perfect spout of oaths. It was a two-guinea piece, and it went from<br/>hand to hand among them for a quarter of a minute.<br/><br/>"Two guineas!" roared Merry, shaking it at Silver. "That's your<br/>seven hundred thousand pounds, is it? You're the man for bargains,<br/>ain't you? You're him that never bungled nothing, you wooden-headed<br/>lubber!"<br/><br/>
