"Why, in the name of Davy Jones," said he, "is Dr. Livesey<br/>mad?"<br/><br/>"Why no," says I. "He's about the last of this crew for that, I<br/>take it."<br/><br/>"Well, shipmate," said Gray, "mad he may not be; but if he's<br/>not, you mark my words, I am."<br/><br/>"I take it," replied I, "the doctor has his idea; and if I am<br/>right, he's going now to see Ben Gunn."<br/><br/>I was right, as appeared later; but in the meantime, the house<br/>being stifling hot and the little patch of sand inside the palisade<br/>ablaze with midday sun, I began to get another thought into my<br/>head, which was not by any means so right. What I began to do was<br/>to envy the doctor walking in the cool shadow of the woods with the<br/>birds about him and the pleasant smell of the pines, while I sat<br/>grilling, with my clothes stuck to the hot resin, and so much blood<br/>about me and so many poor dead bodies lying all around that I took<br/>a disgust of the place that was almost as strong as fear.<br/><br/>All the time I was washing out the block house, and then washing<br/>up the things from dinner, this disgust and envy kept growing<br/>stronger and stronger, till at last, being near a bread-bag, and no<br/>one then observing me, I took the first step towards my escapade<br/>and filled both pockets of my coat with biscuit.<br/><br/>I was a fool, if you like, and certainly I was going to do a<br/>foolish, over-bold act; but I was determined to do it with all the<br/>precautions in my power. These biscuits, should anything befall me,<br/>would keep me, at least, from starving till far on in the next<br/>day.<br/><br/>The next thing I laid hold of was a brace of pistols, and as I<br/>already had a powder-horn and bullets, I felt myself well supplied<br/>with arms.<br/><br/>As for the scheme I had in my head, it was not a bad one in<br/>itself. I was to go down the sandy spit that divides the anchorage<br/>on the east from the open sea, find the white rock I had observed<br/>last evening, and ascertain whether it was there or not that Ben<br/>Gunn had hidden his boat, a thing quite worth doing, as I still<br/>believe. But as I was certain I should not be allowed to leave the<br/>enclosure, my only plan was to take French leave and slip out when<br/>nobody was watching, and that was so bad a way of doing it as made<br/>the thing itself wrong. But I was only a boy, and I had made my<br/>mind up.<br/><br/>Well, as things at last fell out, I found an admirable<br/>opportunity. The squire and Gray were busy helping the captain with<br/>his bandages, the coast was clear, I made a bolt for it over the<br/>stockade and into the thickest of the trees, and before my absence<br/>was observed I was out of cry of my companions.<br/><br/>This was my second folly, far worse than the first, as I left<br/>but two sound men to guard the house; but like the first, it was a<br/>help towards saving all of us.<br/>
