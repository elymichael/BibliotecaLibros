<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>3<br/>Narrative Continued by the Doctor: End of the First Day's<br/>Fighting<br/><br/><br/>W<br/>e made our best<br/>speed across the strip of wood that now divided us from the<br/>stockade, and at every step we took the voices of the buccaneers<br/>rang nearer. Soon we could hear their footfalls as they ran and the<br/>cracking of the branches as they breasted across a bit of<br/>thicket.<br/><br/>I began to see we should have a brush for it in earnest and<br/>looked to my priming.<br/><br/>"Captain," said I, "Trelawney is the dead shot. Give him your<br/>gun; his own is useless."<br/><br/>They exchanged guns, and Trelawney, silent and cool as he had<br/>been since the beginning of the bustle, hung a moment on his heel<br/>to see that all was fit for service. At the same time, observing<br/>Gray to be unarmed, I handed him my cutlass. It did all our hearts<br/>good to see him spit in his hand, knit his brows, and make the<br/>blade sing through the air. It was plain from every line of his<br/>body that our new hand was worth his salt.<br/><br/>Forty paces farther we came to the edge of the wood and saw the<br/>stockade in front of us. We struck the enclosure about the middle<br/>of the south side, and almost at the same time, seven mutineers—Job<br/>Anderson, the boatswain, at their head—appeared in full cry at the<br/>southwestern corner.<br/><br/>They paused as if taken aback, and before they recovered, not<br/>only the squire and I, but Hunter and Joyce from the block house,<br/>had time to fire. The four shots came in rather a scattering<br/>volley, but they did the business: one of the enemy actually fell,<br/>and the rest, without hesitation, turned and plunged into the<br/>trees.<br/><br/>
