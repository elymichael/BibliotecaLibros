<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>1<br/>The Old Sea-dog at the Admiral Benbow<br/><br/><br/>S<br/>quire Trelawney,<br/>Dr. Livesey, and the rest of these gentlemen having asked me to<br/>write down the whole particulars about Treasure Island, from the<br/>beginning to the end, keeping nothing back but the bearings of the<br/>island, and that only because there is still treasure not yet<br/>lifted, I take up my pen in the year of grace 17—, and go back to<br/>the time when my father kept the Admiral Benbow inn and the brown<br/>old seaman with the sabre cut first took up his lodging under our<br/>roof. I remember him as if it were yesterday, as he came plodding<br/>to the inn door, his sea-chest following behind him in a<br/>hand-barrow—a tall, strong, heavy, nut-brown man, his tarry pigtail<br/>falling over the shoulder of his soiled blue coat, his hands ragged<br/>and scarred, with black, broken nails, and the sabre cut across one<br/>cheek, a dirty, livid white. I remember him looking round the cover<br/>and whistling to himself as he did so, and then breaking out in<br/>that old sea-song that he sang so often afterwards:<br/><br/><br/>"Fifteen men on the dead man's chest—<br/><br/>Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!"<br/><br/><br/>in the high, old tottering voice that seemed to have been tuned<br/>and broken at the capstan bars. Then he rapped on the door with a<br/>bit of stick like a handspike that he carried, and when my father<br/>appeared, called roughly for a glass of rum. This, when it was<br/>brought to him, he drank slowly, like a connoisseur, lingering on<br/>the taste and still looking about him at the cliffs and up at our<br/>signboard.<br/><br/>"This is a handy cove," says he at length; "and a pleasant<br/>sittyated grog-shop. Much company, mate?" My father told him no,<br/>very little company, the more was the pity.<br/><br/>
