With that I made my mind up, took out my gully, opened it with<br/>my teeth, and cut one strand after another, till the vessel swung<br/>only by two. Then I lay quiet, waiting to sever these last when the<br/>strain should be once more lightened by a breath of wind.<br/><br/>All this time I had heard the sound of loud voices from the<br/>cabin, but to say truth, my mind had been so entirely taken up with<br/>other thoughts that I had scarcely given ear. Now, however, when I<br/>had nothing else to do, I began to pay more heed.<br/><br/>One I recognized for the coxswain's, Israel Hands, that had been<br/>Flint's gunner in former days. The other was, of course, my friend<br/>of the red night-cap. Both men were plainly the worse of drink, and<br/>they were still drinking, for even while I was listening, one of<br/>them, with a drunken cry, opened the stern window and threw out<br/>something, which I divined to be an empty bottle. But they were not<br/>only tipsy; it was plain that they were furiously angry. Oaths flew<br/>like hailstones, and every now and then there came forth such an<br/>explosion as I thought was sure to end in blows. But each time the<br/>quarrel passed off and the voices grumbled lower for a while, until<br/>the next crisis came and in its turn passed away without<br/>result.<br/><br/>On shore, I could see the glow of the great camp-fire burning<br/>warmly through the shore-side trees. Someone was singing, a dull,<br/>old, droning sailor's song, with a droop and a quaver at the end of<br/>every verse, and seemingly no end to it at all but the patience of<br/>the singer. I had heard it on the voyage more than once and<br/>remembered these words:<br/><br/>"But one man of her crew alive,<br/><br/>What put to sea with seventy-five."<br/><br/>And I thought it was a ditty rather too dolefully appropriate<br/>for a company that had met such cruel losses in the morning. But,<br/>indeed, from what I saw, all these buccaneers were as callous as<br/>the sea they sailed on.<br/><br/>At last the breeze came; the schooner sidled and drew nearer in<br/>the dark; I felt the hawser slacken once more, and with a good,<br/>tough effort, cut the last fibres through.<br/><br/>The breeze had but little action on the coracle, and I was<br/>almost instantly swept against the bows of the Hispaniola. At the<br/>same time, the schooner began to turn upon her heel, spinning<br/>slowly, end for end, across the current.<br/><br/>I wrought like a fiend, for I expected every moment to be<br/>swamped; and since I found I could not push the coracle directly<br/>off, I now shoved straight astern. At length I was clear of my<br/>dangerous neighbour, and just as I gave the last impulsion, my<br/>hands came across a light cord that was trailing overboard across<br/>the stern bulwarks. Instantly I grasped it.<br/><br/>Why I should have done so I can hardly say. It was at first mere<br/>instinct, but once I had it in my hands and found it fast,<br/>curiosity began to get the upper hand, and I determined I should<br/>have one look through the cabin window.<br/>
