<br/>"I dare you to thank me!" cried the squire. "It is a gross<br/>dereliction of my duty. Stand back."<br/><br/>And thereupon we all entered the cave. It was a large, airy<br/>place, with a little spring and a pool of clear water, overhung<br/>with ferns. The floor was sand. Before a big fire lay Captain<br/>Smollett; and in a far corner, only duskily flickered over by the<br/>blaze, I beheld great heaps of coin and quadrilaterals built of<br/>bars of gold. That was Flint's treasure that we had come so far to<br/>seek and that had cost already the lives of seventeen men from the<br/>Hispaniola. How many it had cost in the amassing, what blood and<br/>sorrow, what good ships scuttled on the deep, what brave men<br/>walking the plank blindfold, what shot of cannon, what shame and<br/>lies and cruelty, perhaps no man alive could tell. Yet there were<br/>still three upon that island—Silver, and old Morgan, and Ben<br/>Gunn—who had each taken his share in these crimes, as each had<br/>hoped in vain to share in the reward.<br/><br/>"Come in, Jim," said the captain. "You're a good boy in your<br/>line, Jim, but I don't think you and me'll go to sea again. You're<br/>too much of the born favourite for me. Is that you, John Silver?<br/>What brings you here, man?"<br/><br/>"Come back to my dooty, sir," returned Silver.<br/><br/>"Ah!" said the captain, and that was all he said.<br/><br/>What a supper I had of it that night, with all my friends around<br/>me; and what a meal it was, with Ben Gunn's salted goat and some<br/>delicacies and a bottle of old wine from the Hispaniola. Never, I<br/>am sure, were people gayer or happier. And there was Silver,<br/>sitting back almost out of the firelight, but eating heartily,<br/>prompt to spring forward when anything was wanted, even joining<br/>quietly in our laughter—the same bland, polite, obsequious seaman<br/>of the voyage out.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
