I remembered what Silver had said about the current that sets
northward along the whole west coast of Treasure Island, and seeing
from my position that I was already under its influence, I
preferred to leave Haulbowline Head behind me and reserve my
strength for an attempt to land upon the kindlier-looking Cape of
the Woods.

There was a great, smooth swell upon the sea. The wind blowing
steady and gentle from the south, there was no contrariety between
that and the current, and the billows rose and fell unbroken.

Had it been otherwise, I must long ago have perished; but as it
was, it is surprising how easily and securely my little and light
boat could ride. Often, as I still lay at the bottom and kept no
more than an eye above the gunwale, I would see a big blue summit
heaving close above me; yet the coracle would but bounce a little,
dance as if on springs, and subside on the other side into the
trough as lightly as a bird.

I began after a little to grow very bold and sat up to try my
skill at paddling. But even a small change in the disposition of
the weight will produce violent changes in the behaviour of a
coracle. And I had hardly moved before the boat, giving up at once
her gentle dancing movement, ran straight down a slope of water so
steep that it made me giddy, and struck her nose, with a spout of
spray, deep into the side of the next wave.

I was drenched and terrified, and fell instantly back into my
old position, whereupon the coracle seemed to find her head again
and led me as softly as before among the billows. It was plain she
was not to be interfered with, and at that rate, since I could in
no way influence her course, what hope had I left of reaching
land?

I began to be horribly frightened, but I kept my head, for all
that. First, moving with all care, I gradually baled out the
coracle with my sea-cap; then, getting my eye once more above the
gunwale, I set myself to study how it was she managed to slip so
quietly through the rollers.

I found each wave, instead of the big, smooth glossy mountain it
looks from shore or from a vessel's deck, was for all the world
like any range of hills on dry land, full of peaks and smooth
places and valleys. The coracle, left to herself, turning from side
to side, threaded, so to speak, her way through these lower parts
and avoided the steep slopes and higher, toppling summits of the
wave.

"Well, now," thought I to myself, "it is plain I must lie where
I am and not disturb the balance; but it is plain also that I can
put the paddle over the side and from time to time, in smooth
places, give her a shove or two towards land." No sooner thought
upon than done. There I lay on my elbows in the most trying
attitude, and every now and again gave a weak stroke or two to turn
her head to shore.

It was very tiring and slow work, yet I did visibly gain ground;
and as we drew near the Cape of the Woods, though I saw I must
infallibly miss that point, I had still made some hundred yards of
easting. I was, indeed, close in. I could see the cool green
tree-tops swaying together in the breeze, and I felt sure I should
make the next promontory without fail.

It was high time, for I now began to be tortured with thirst.
The glow of the sun from above, its thousandfold reflection from
the waves, the sea-water that fell and dried upon me, caking my
very lips with salt, combined to make my throat burn and my brain
ache. The sight of the trees so near at hand had almost made me
sick with longing, but the current had soon carried me past the
point, and as the next reach of sea opened out, I beheld a sight
that changed the nature of my thoughts.

Right in front of me, not half a mile away, I beheld the
Hispaniola under sail. I made sure, of course, that I should be
taken; but I was so distressed for want of water that I scarce knew
whether to be glad or sorry at the thought, and long before I had
come to a conclusion, surprise had taken entire possession of my
mind and I could do nothing but stare and wonder.
