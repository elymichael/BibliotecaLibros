"I've a head on my<br/>shoulders, I have. I'm on squire's side now. I know you've got that<br/>ship safe somewheres. How you done it, I don't know, but safe it<br/>is. I guess Hands and O'Brien turned soft. I never much believed in<br/>neither of them. Now you mark me. I ask no questions, nor I won't<br/>let others. I know when a game's up, I do; and I know a lad that's<br/>staunch. Ah, you that's young—you and me might have done a power of<br/>good together!"<br/><br/>He drew some cognac from the cask into a tin cannikin.<br/><br/>"Will you taste, messmate?" he asked; and when I had refused:<br/>"Well, I'll take a drain myself, Jim," said he. "I need a caulker,<br/>for there's trouble on hand. And talking o' trouble, why did that<br/>doctor give me the chart, Jim?"<br/><br/>My face expressed a wonder so unaffected that he saw the<br/>needlessness of further questions.<br/><br/>"Ah, well, he did, though," said he. "And there's something<br/>under that, no doubt—something, surely, under that, Jim—bad or<br/>good."<br/><br/>And he took another swallow of the brandy, shaking his great<br/>fair head like a man who looks forward to the worst.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
