<br/>"I told you so!" cried the captain.<br/><br/>"Thank you, sir," returned Joyce with the same quiet<br/>civility.<br/><br/>Nothing followed for a time, but the remark had set us all on<br/>the alert, straining ears and eyes—the musketeers with their pieces<br/>balanced in their hands, the captain out in the middle of the block<br/>house with his mouth very tight and a frown on his face.<br/><br/>So some seconds passed, till suddenly Joyce whipped up his<br/>musket and fired. The report had scarcely died away ere it was<br/>repeated and repeated from without in a scattering volley, shot<br/>behind shot, like a string of geese, from every side of the<br/>enclosure. Several bullets struck the log-house, but not one<br/>entered; and as the smoke cleared away and vanished, the stockade<br/>and the woods around it looked as quiet and empty as before. Not a<br/>bough waved, not the gleam of a musket-barrel betrayed the presence<br/>of our foes.<br/><br/>"Did you hit your man?" asked the captain.<br/><br/>"No, sir," replied Joyce. "I believe not, sir."<br/><br/>"Next best thing to tell the truth," muttered Captain Smollett.<br/>"Load his gun, Hawkins. How many should say there were on your<br/>side, doctor?"<br/><br/>"I know precisely," said Dr. Livesey. "Three shots were fired on<br/>this side. I saw the three flashes—two close together—one farther<br/>to the west."<br/><br/>"Three!" repeated the captain. "And how many on yours, Mr.<br/>Trelawney?"<br/><br/>But this was not so easily answered. There had come many from<br/>the north—seven by the squire's computation, eight or nine<br/>according to Gray. From the east and west only a single shot had<br/>been fired. It was plain, therefore, that the attack would be<br/>developed from the north and that on the other three sides we were<br/>only to be annoyed by a show of hostilities. But Captain Smollett<br/>made no change in his arrangements. If the mutineers succeeded in<br/>crossing the stockade, he argued, they would take possession of any<br/>unprotected loophole and shoot us down like rats in our own<br/>stronghold.<br/><br/>
