"As for you, Jim," he said, "it went against my heart, but I did<br/>what I thought best for those who had stood by their duty; and if<br/>you were not one of these, whose fault was it?"<br/><br/>That morning, finding that I was to be involved in the horrid<br/>disappointment he had prepared for the mutineers, he had run all<br/>the way to the cave, and leaving the squire to guard the captain,<br/>had taken Gray and the maroon and started, making the diagonal<br/>across the island to be at hand beside the pine. Soon, however, he<br/>saw that our party had the start of him; and Ben Gunn, being fleet<br/>of foot, had been dispatched in front to do his best alone. Then it<br/>had occurred to him to work upon the superstitions of his former<br/>shipmates, and he was so far successful that Gray and the doctor<br/>had come up and were already ambushed before the arrival of the<br/>treasure-hunters.<br/><br/>"Ah," said Silver, "it were fortunate for me that I had Hawkins<br/>here. You would have let old John be cut to bits, and never given<br/>it a thought, doctor."<br/><br/>"Not a thought," replied Dr. Livesey cheerily.<br/><br/>And by this time we had reached the gigs. The doctor, with the<br/>pick-axe, demolished one of them, and then we all got aboard the<br/>other and set out to go round by sea for North Inlet.<br/><br/>This was a run of eight or nine miles. Silver, though he was<br/>almost killed already with fatigue, was set to an oar, like the<br/>rest of us, and we were soon skimming swiftly over a smooth sea.<br/>Soon we passed out of the straits and doubled the south-east corner<br/>of the island, round which, four days ago, we had towed the<br/>Hispaniola.<br/><br/>As we passed the two-pointed hill, we could see the black mouth<br/>of Ben Gunn's cave and a figure standing by it, leaning on a<br/>musket. It was the squire, and we waved a handkerchief and gave him<br/>three cheers, in which the voice of Silver joined as heartily as<br/>any.<br/><br/>Three miles farther, just inside the mouth of North Inlet, what<br/>should we meet but the Hispaniola, cruising by herself? The last<br/>flood had lifted her, and had there been much wind or a strong tide<br/>current, as in the southern anchorage, we should never have found<br/>her more, or found her stranded beyond help. As it was, there was<br/>little amiss beyond the wreck of the main-sail. Another anchor was<br/>got ready and dropped in a fathom and a half of water. We all<br/>pulled round again to Rum Cove, the nearest point for Ben Gunn's<br/>treasure-house; and then Gray, single-handed, returned with the gig<br/>to the Hispaniola, where he was to pass the night on guard.<br/><br/>A gentle slope ran up from the beach to the entrance of the<br/>cave. At the top, the squire met us. To me he was cordial and kind,<br/>saying nothing of my escapade either in the way of blame or praise.<br/>At Silver's polite salute he somewhat flushed.<br/><br/>"John Silver," he said, "you're a prodigious villain and<br/>imposterâ€”a monstrous imposter, sir. I am told I am not to prosecute<br/>you. Well, then, I will not. But the dead men, sir, hang about your<br/>neck like mill-stones."<br/><br/>"Thank you kindly, sir," replied Long John, again saluting.<br/>
