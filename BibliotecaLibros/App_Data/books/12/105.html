<br/>Silver had terrible hard work getting up the knoll. What with<br/>the steepness of the incline, the thick tree stumps, and the soft<br/>sand, he and his crutch were as helpless as a ship in stays. But he<br/>stuck to it like a man in silence, and at last arrived before the<br/>captain, whom he saluted in the handsomest style. He was tricked<br/>out in his best; an immense blue coat, thick with brass buttons,<br/>hung as low as to his knees, and a fine laced hat was set on the<br/>back of his head.<br/><br/>"Here you are, my man," said the captain, raising his head. "You<br/>had better sit down."<br/><br/>"You ain't a-going to let me inside, cap'n?" complained Long<br/>John. "It's a main cold morning, to be sure, sir, to sit outside<br/>upon the sand."<br/><br/>"Why, Silver," said the captain, "if you had pleased to be an<br/>honest man, you might have been sitting in your galley. It's your<br/>own doing. You're either my ship's cook—and then you were treated<br/>handsome—or Cap'n Silver, a common mutineer and pirate, and then<br/>you can go hang!"<br/><br/>"Well, well, cap'n," returned the sea-cook, sitting down as he<br/>was bidden on the sand, "you'll have to give me a hand up again,<br/>that's all. A sweet pretty place you have of it here. Ah, there's<br/>Jim! The top of the morning to you, Jim. Doctor, here's my service.<br/>Why, there you all are together like a happy family, in a manner of<br/>speaking."<br/><br/>"If you have anything to say, my man, better say it," said the<br/>captain.<br/><br/>"Right you were, Cap'n Smollett," replied Silver. "Dooty is<br/>dooty, to be sure. Well now, you look here, that was a good lay of<br/>yours last night. I don't deny it was a good lay. Some of you<br/>pretty handy with a handspike-end. And I'll not deny neither but<br/>what some of my people was shook—maybe all was shook; maybe I was<br/>shook myself; maybe that's why I'm here for terms. But you mark me,<br/>cap'n, it won't do twice, by thunder! We'll have to do sentry-go<br/>and ease off a point or so on the rum. Maybe you think we were all<br/>a sheet in the wind's eye. But I'll tell you I was sober; I was<br/>on'y dog tired; and if I'd awoke a second sooner, I'd 'a caught you<br/>at the act, I would. He wasn't dead when I got round to him, not<br/>he."<br/><br/>"Well?" says Captain Smollett as cool as can be.<br/><br/>All that Silver said was a riddle to him, but you would never<br/>have guessed it from his tone. As for me, I began to have an<br/>inkling. Ben Gunn's last words came back to my mind. I began to<br/>suppose that he had paid the buccaneers a visit while they all lay<br/>drunk together round their fire, and I reckoned up with glee that<br/>we had only fourteen enemies to deal with.<br/><br/>"Well, here it is," said Silver. "We want that treasure, and<br/>we'll have it—that's our point! You would just as soon save your<br/>lives, I reckon; and that's yours. You have a chart, haven't<br/>you?"<br/><br/>
