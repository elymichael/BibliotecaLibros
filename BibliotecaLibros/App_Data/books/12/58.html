"Here it is about gentlemen of fortune. They lives rough, and<br/>they risk swinging, but they eat and drink like fighting-cocks, and<br/>when a cruise is done, why, it's hundreds of pounds instead of<br/>hundreds of farthings in their pockets. Now, the most goes for rum<br/>and a good fling, and to sea again in their shirts. But that's not<br/>the course I lay. I puts it all away, some here, some there, and<br/>none too much anywheres, by reason of suspicion. I'm fifty, mark<br/>you; once back from this cruise, I set up gentleman in earnest.<br/>Time enough too, says you. Ah, but I've lived easy in the meantime,<br/>never denied myself o' nothing heart desires, and slep' soft and<br/>ate dainty all my days but when at sea. And how did I begin? Before<br/>the mast, like you!"<br/><br/>"Well," said the other, "but all the other money's gone now,<br/>ain't it? You daren't show face in Bristol after this."<br/><br/>"Why, where might you suppose it was?" asked Silver<br/>derisively.<br/><br/>"At Bristol, in banks and places," answered his companion.<br/><br/>"It were," said the cook; "it were when we weighed anchor. But<br/>my old missis has it all by now. And the Spy-glass is sold, lease<br/>and goodwill and rigging; and the old girl's off to meet me. I<br/>would tell you where, for I trust you, but it'd make jealousy among<br/>the mates."<br/><br/>"And can you trust your missis?" asked the other.<br/><br/>"Gentlemen of fortune," returned the cook, "usually trusts<br/>little among themselves, and right they are, you may lay to it. But<br/>I have a way with me, I have. When a mate brings a slip on his<br/>cable—one as knows me, I mean—it won't be in the same world with<br/>old John. There was some that was feared of Pew, and some that was<br/>feared of Flint; but Flint his own self was feared of me. Feared he<br/>was, and proud. They was the roughest crew afloat, was Flint's; the<br/>devil himself would have been feared to go to sea with them. Well<br/>now, I tell you, I'm not a boasting man, and you seen yourself how<br/>easy I keep company, but when I was quartermaster, lambs wasn't the<br/>word for Flint's old buccaneers. Ah, you may be sure of yourself in<br/>old John's ship."<br/><br/>"Well, I tell you now," replied the lad, "I didn't half a<br/>quarter like the job till I had this talk with you, John; but<br/>there's my hand on it now."<br/><br/>"And a brave lad you were, and smart too," answered Silver,<br/>shaking hands so heartily that all the barrel shook, "and a finer<br/>figurehead for a gentleman of fortune I never clapped my eyes<br/>on."<br/><br/>By this time I had begun to understand the meaning of their<br/>terms. By a "gentleman of fortune" they plainly meant neither more<br/>nor less than a common pirate, and the little scene that I had<br/>overheard was the last act in the corruption of one of the honest<br/>hands—perhaps of the last one left aboard. But on this point I was<br/>soon to be relieved, for Silver giving a little whistle, a third<br/>man strolled up and sat down by the party.<br/><br/>"Dick's square," said Silver.<br/>
