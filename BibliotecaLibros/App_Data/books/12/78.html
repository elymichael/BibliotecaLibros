<br/>"Jim," I told him.<br/><br/>"Jim, Jim," says he, quite pleased apparently. "Well, now, Jim,<br/>I've lived that rough as you'd be ashamed to hear of. Now, for<br/>instance, you wouldn't think I had had a pious mother—to look at<br/>me?" he asked.<br/><br/>"Why, no, not in particular," I answered.<br/><br/>"Ah, well," said he, "but I had—remarkable pious. And I was a<br/>civil, pious boy, and could rattle off my catechism that fast, as<br/>you couldn't tell one word from another. And here's what it come<br/>to, Jim, and it begun with chuck-farthen on the blessed<br/>grave-stones! That's what it begun with, but it went further'n<br/>that; and so my mother told me, and predicked the whole, she did,<br/>the pious woman! But it were Providence that put me here. I've<br/>thought it all out in this here lonely island, and I'm back on<br/>piety. You don't catch me tasting rum so much, but just a<br/>thimbleful for luck, of course, the first chance I have.

Rich! I says. And I'll<br/>tell you what: I'll make a man of you, Jim. Ah, Jim, you'll bless<br/>your stars, you will, you was the first that found me!"<br/><br/>And at this there came suddenly a lowering shadow over his face,<br/>and he tightened his grasp upon my hand and raised a forefinger<br/>threateningly before my eyes.<br/><br/>"Now, Jim, you tell me true: that ain't Flint's ship?" he<br/>asked.<br/><br/>At this I had a happy inspiration. I began to believe that I had<br/>found an ally, and I answered him at once.<br/><br/>"It's not Flint's ship, and Flint is dead; but I'll tell you<br/>true, as you ask me—there are some of Flint's hands aboard; worse<br/>luck for the rest of us."<br/><br/>"Not a man—with one—leg?" he gasped.<br/><br/>
