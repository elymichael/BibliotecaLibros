"I don't like them, sir," returned Captain Smollett. "And I
think I should have had the choosing of my own hands, if you go to
that."

"Perhaps you should," replied the doctor. "My friend should,
perhaps, have taken you along with him; but the slight, if there be
one, was unintentional. And you don't like Mr. Arrow?"

"I don't, sir. I believe he's a good seaman, but he's too free
with the crew to be a good officer. A mate should keep himself to
himself—shouldn't drink with the men before the mast!"

"Do you mean he drinks?" cried the squire.

"No, sir," replied the captain, "only that he's too
familiar."

"Well, now, and the short and long of it, captain?" asked the
doctor. "Tell us what you want."

"Well, gentlemen, are you determined to go on this cruise?"

"Like iron," answered the squire.

"Very good," said the captain. "Then, as you've heard me very
patiently, saying things that I could not prove, hear me a few
words more. They are putting the powder and the arms in the fore
hold. Now, you have a good place under the cabin; why not put them
there?—first point. Then, you are bringing four of your own people
with you, and they tell me some of them are to be berthed forward.
Why not give them the berths here beside the cabin?—second
point."

"Any more?" asked Mr. Trelawney.
