"It's to you, Abraham Grayâ€”it's to you I am speaking."

Still no reply.

"Gray," resumed Mr. Smollett, a little louder, "I am leaving
this ship, and I order you to follow your captain. I know you are a
good man at bottom, and I dare say not one of the lot of you's as
bad as he makes out. I have my watch here in my hand; I give you
thirty seconds to join me in."

There was a pause.

"Come, my fine fellow," continued the captain; "don't hang so
long in stays. I'm risking my life and the lives of these good
gentlemen every second."

There was a sudden scuffle, a sound of blows, and out burst
Abraham Gray with a knife cut on the side of the cheek, and came
running to the captain like a dog to the whistle.

"I'm with you, sir," said he.

And the next moment he and the captain had dropped aboard of us,
and we had shoved off and given way. We were clear out of the ship,
but not yet ashore in our stockade.
