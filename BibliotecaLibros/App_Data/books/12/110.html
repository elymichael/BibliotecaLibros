On the two short sides of the house, east and west, there were<br/>only two loopholes; on the south side where the porch was, two<br/>again; and on the north side, five. There was a round score of<br/>muskets for the seven of us; the firewood had been built into four<br/>piles—tables, you might say—one about the middle of each side, and<br/>on each of these tables some ammunition and four loaded muskets<br/>were laid ready to the hand of the defenders. In the middle, the<br/>cutlasses lay ranged.<br/><br/>"Toss out the fire," said the captain; "the chill is past, and<br/>we mustn't have smoke in our eyes."<br/><br/>The iron fire-basket was carried bodily out by Mr. Trelawney,<br/>and the embers smothered among sand.<br/><br/>"Hawkins hasn't had his breakfast. Hawkins, help yourself, and<br/>back to your post to eat it," continued Captain Smollett. "Lively,<br/>now, my lad; you'll want it before you've done. Hunter, serve out a<br/>round of brandy to all hands."<br/><br/>And while this was going on, the captain completed, in his own<br/>mind, the plan of the defence.<br/><br/>"Doctor, you will take the door," he resumed. "See, and don't<br/>expose yourself; keep within, and fire through the porch. Hunter,<br/>take the east side, there. Joyce, you stand by the west, my man.<br/>Mr. Trelawney, you are the best shot—you and Gray will take this<br/>long north side, with the five loopholes; it's there the danger is.<br/>If they can get up to it and fire in upon us through our own ports,<br/>things would begin to look dirty. Hawkins, neither you nor I are<br/>much account at the shooting; we'll stand by to load and bear a<br/>hand."<br/><br/>As the captain had said, the chill was past. As soon as the sun<br/>had climbed above our girdle of trees, it fell with all its force<br/>upon the clearing and drank up the vapours at a draught. Soon the<br/>sane was baking and the resin melting in the logs of the block<br/>house. Jackets and coats were flung aside, shirts thrown open at<br/>the neck and rolled up to the shoulders; and we stood there, each<br/>at his post, in a fever of heat and anxiety.<br/><br/>An hour passed away.<br/><br/>"Hang them!" said the captain. "This is as dull as the doldrums.<br/>Gray, whistle for a wind."<br/><br/>And just at that moment came the first news of the attack.<br/><br/>"If you please, sir," said Joyce, "if I see anyone, am I to<br/>fire?"<br/>
