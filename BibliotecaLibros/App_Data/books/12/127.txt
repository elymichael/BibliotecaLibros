My first impulse was one of despair, but my second was towards
joy. Round she came, till she was broadside on to me—round still
till she had covered a half and then two thirds and then three
quarters of the distance that separated us. I could see the waves
boiling white under her forefoot. Immensely tall she looked to me
from my low station in the coracle.

And then, of a sudden, I began to comprehend. I had scarce time
to think—scarce time to act and save myself. I was on the summit of
one swell when the schooner came stooping over the next. The
bowsprit was over my head. I sprang to my feet and leaped, stamping
the coracle under water. With one hand I caught the jib-boom, while
my foot was lodged between the stay and the brace; and as I still
clung there panting, a dull blow told me that the schooner had
charged down upon and struck the coracle and that I was left
without retreat on the Hispaniola.
