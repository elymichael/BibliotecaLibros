<br/><br/>About Stevenson:<br/><br/>Robert Louis (Balfour) Stevenson (November 13, 1850â€“December 3,<br/>1894), was a Scottish novelist, poet, and travel writer, and a<br/>leading representative of Neo-romanticism in English literature. He<br/>was the man who "seemed to pick the right word up on the point of<br/>his pen, like a man playing spillikins", as G. K. Chesterton put<br/>it. He was also greatly admired by many authors, including Jorge<br/>Luis Borges, Ernest Hemingway, Rudyard Kipling and Vladimir<br/>Nabokov. Most modernist writers dismissed him, however, because he<br/>was popular and did not write within their narrow definition of<br/>literature. It is only recently that critics have begun to look<br/>beyond Stevenson's popularity and allow him a place in the canon.<br/>Source: Wikipedia<br/><br/><br/>Also available on Feedbooks<br/>Stevenson:<br/><br/><br/>Strange Case of Dr<br/>Jekyll and Mr Hyde<br/>(1886)<br/><br/>Kidnapped<br/>(1886)<br/><br/>The<br/>Black Arrow<br/>(1884)<br/><br/>The<br/>New Arabian Nights<br/>(1882)<br/><br/>
