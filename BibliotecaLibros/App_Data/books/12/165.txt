The Treasure Hunt--The Voice Among the Trees


P
artly from the
damping influence of this alarm, partly to rest Silver and the sick
folk, the whole party sat down as soon as they had gained the brow
of the ascent.

The plateau being somewhat tilted towards the west, this spot on
which we had paused commanded a wide prospect on either hand.
Before us, over the tree-tops, we beheld the Cape of the Woods
fringed with surf; behind, we not only looked down upon the
anchorage and Skeleton Island, but saw—clear across the spit and
the eastern lowlands—a great field of open sea upon the east. Sheer
above us rose the Spy-glass, here dotted with single pines, there
black with precipices. There was no sound but that of the distant
breakers, mounting from all round, and the chirp of countless
insects in the brush. Not a man, not a sail, upon the sea; the very
largeness of the view increased the sense of solitude.

Silver, as he sat, took certain bearings with his compass.

"There are three 'tall trees'" said he, "about in the right line
from Skeleton Island. 'Spy-glass shoulder,' I take it, means that
lower p'int there. It's child's play to find the stuff now. I've
half a mind to dine first."

"I don't feel sharp," growled Morgan. "Thinkin' o' Flint—I think
it were—as done me."

"Ah, well, my son, you praise your stars he's dead," said
Silver.
