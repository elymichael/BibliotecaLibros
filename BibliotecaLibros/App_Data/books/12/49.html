<br/>"I don't like them, sir," returned Captain Smollett. "And I<br/>think I should have had the choosing of my own hands, if you go to<br/>that."<br/><br/>"Perhaps you should," replied the doctor. "My friend should,<br/>perhaps, have taken you along with him; but the slight, if there be<br/>one, was unintentional. And you don't like Mr. Arrow?"<br/><br/>"I don't, sir. I believe he's a good seaman, but he's too free<br/>with the crew to be a good officer. A mate should keep himself to<br/>himself—shouldn't drink with the men before the mast!"<br/><br/>"Do you mean he drinks?" cried the squire.<br/><br/>"No, sir," replied the captain, "only that he's too<br/>familiar."<br/><br/>"Well, now, and the short and long of it, captain?" asked the<br/>doctor. "Tell us what you want."<br/><br/>"Well, gentlemen, are you determined to go on this cruise?"<br/><br/>"Like iron," answered the squire.<br/><br/>"Very good," said the captain.

Now, you have a good place under the cabin; why not put them<br/>there?—first point. Then, you are bringing four of your own people<br/>with you, and they tell me some of them are to be berthed forward.<br/>Why not give them the berths here beside the cabin?—second<br/>point."<br/><br/>"Any more?" asked Mr. Trelawney.<br/><br/>
