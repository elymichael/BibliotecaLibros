In the meantime the captain, whom I had observed to be
wonderfully swollen about the chest and pockets, had turned out a
great many various stores—the British colours, a Bible, a coil of
stoutish rope, pen, ink, the log-book, and pounds of tobacco. He
had found a longish fir-tree lying felled and trimmed in the
enclosure, and with the help of Hunter he had set it up at the
corner of the log-house where the trunks crossed and made an angle.
Then, climbing on the roof, he had with his own hand bent and run
up the colours.

This seemed mightily to relieve him. He re-entered the log-house
and set about counting up the stores as if nothing else existed.
But he had an eye on Tom's passage for all that, and as soon as all
was over, came forward with another flag and reverently spread it
on the body.

"Don't you take on, sir," he said, shaking the squire's hand.
"All's well with him; no fear for a hand that's been shot down in
his duty to captain and owner. It mayn't be good divinity, but it's
a fact."

Then he pulled me aside.

"Dr. Livesey," he said, "in how many weeks do you and squire
expect the consort?"

I told him it was a question not of weeks but of months, that if
we were not back by the end of August Blandly was to send to find
us, but neither sooner nor later. "You can calculate for yourself,"
I said.

"Why, yes," returned the captain, scratching his head; "and
making a large allowance, sir, for all the gifts of Providence, I
should say we were pretty close hauled."

"How do you mean?" I asked.

"It's a pity, sir, we lost that second load. That's what I
mean," replied the captain. "As for powder and shot, we'll do. But
the rations are short, very short—so short, Dr. Livesey, that we're
perhaps as well without that extra mouth."

And he pointed to the dead body under the flag.
