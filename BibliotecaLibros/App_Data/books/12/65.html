And they made me sit down at table beside them, poured me out a<br/>glass of wine, filled my hands with raisins, and all three, one<br/>after the other, and each with a bow, drank my good health, and<br/>their service to me, for my luck and courage.<br/><br/>"Now, captain," said the squire, "you were right, and I was<br/>wrong. I own myself an ass, and I await your orders."<br/><br/>"No more an ass than I, sir," returned the captain. "I never<br/>heard of a crew that meant to mutiny but what showed signs before,<br/>for any man that had an eye in his head to see the mischief and<br/>take steps according. But this crew," he added, "beats me."<br/><br/>"Captain," said the doctor, "with your permission, that's<br/>Silver. A very remarkable man."<br/><br/>"He'd look remarkably well from a yard-arm, sir," returned the<br/>captain. "But this is talk; this don't lead to anything. I see<br/>three or four points, and with Mr. Trelawney's permission, I'll<br/>name them."<br/><br/>"You, sir, are the captain. It is for you to speak," says Mr.<br/>Trelawney grandly.<br/><br/>"First point," began Mr. Smollett. "We must go on, because we<br/>can't turn back. If I gave the word to go about, they would rise at<br/>once. Second point, we have time before usâ€”at least until this<br/>treasure's found. Third point, there are faithful hands. Now, sir,<br/>it's got to come to blows sooner or later, and what I propose is to<br/>take time by the forelock, as the saying is, and come to blows some<br/>fine day when they least expect it. We can count, I take it, on<br/>your own home servants, Mr. Trelawney?"<br/><br/>"As upon myself," declared the squire.<br/><br/>"Three," reckoned the captain; "ourselves make seven, counting<br/>Hawkins here. Now, about the honest hands?"<br/><br/>"Most likely Trelawney's own men," said the doctor; "those he<br/>had picked up for himself before he lit on Silver."<br/><br/>"Nay," replied the squire. "Hands was one of mine."<br/>
