The Attack


A
s soon as Silver
disappeared, the captain, who had been closely watching him, turned
towards the interior of the house and found not a man of us at his
post but Gray. It was the first time we had ever seen him
angry.

"Quarters!" he roared. And then, as we all slunk back to our
places, "Gray," he said, "I'll put your name in the log; you've
stood by your duty like a seaman. Mr. Trelawney, I'm surprised at
you, sir. Doctor, I thought you had worn the king's coat! If that
was how you served at Fontenoy, sir, you'd have been better in your
berth."

The doctor's watch were all back at their loopholes, the rest
were busy loading the spare muskets, and everyone with a red face,
you may be certain, and a flea in his ear, as the saying is.

The captain looked on for a while in silence. Then he spoke.

"My lads," said he, "I've given Silver a broadside. I pitched it
in red-hot on purpose; and before the hour's out, as he said, we
shall be boarded. We're outnumbered, I needn't tell you that, but
we fight in shelter; and a minute ago I should have said we fought
with discipline. I've no manner of doubt that we can drub them, if
you choose."

Then he went the rounds and saw, as he said, that all was
clear.
