I glanced over my shoulder, and my heart jumped against my ribs.
There, right behind me, was the glow of the camp-fire. The current
had turned at right angles, sweeping round along with it the tall
schooner and the little dancing coracle; ever quickening, ever
bubbling higher, ever muttering louder, it went spinning through
the narrows for the open sea.

Suddenly the schooner in front of me gave a violent yaw,
turning, perhaps, through twenty degrees; and almost at the same
moment one shout followed another from on board; I could hear feet
pounding on the companion ladder and I knew that the two drunkards
had at last been interrupted in their quarrel and awakened to a
sense of their disaster.

I lay down flat in the bottom of that wretched skiff and
devoutly recommended my spirit to its Maker. At the end of the
straits, I made sure we must fall into some bar of raging breakers,
where all my troubles would be ended speedily; and though I could,
perhaps, bear to die, I could not bear to look upon my fate as it
approached.

So I must have lain for hours, continually beaten to and fro
upon the billows, now and again wetted with flying sprays, and
never ceasing to expect death at the next plunge. Gradually
weariness grew upon me; a numbness, an occasional stupor, fell upon
my mind even in the midst of my terrors, until sleep at last
supervened and in my sea-tossed coracle I lay and dreamed of home
and the old Admiral Benbow.
