I know you are a<br/>good man at bottom, and I dare say not one of the lot of you's as<br/>bad as he makes out. I have my watch here in my hand; I give you<br/>thirty seconds to join me in."<br/><br/>There was a pause.<br/><br/>"Come, my fine fellow," continued the captain; "don't hang so<br/>long in stays. I'm risking my life and the lives of these good<br/>gentlemen every second."<br/><br/>There was a sudden scuffle, a sound of blows, and out burst<br/>Abraham Gray with a knife cut on the side of the cheek, and came<br/>running to the captain like a dog to the whistle.<br/><br/>"I'm with you, sir," said he.<br/><br/>And the next moment he and the captain had dropped aboard of us,<br/>and we had shoved off and given way. We were clear out of the ship,<br/>but not yet ashore in our stockade.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
