<br/>"There are three men waiting for him at the door," said<br/>Holmes.<br/><br/>"Oh, indeed! You seem to have done the thing very completely. I<br/>must compliment you."<br/><br/>"And I you," Holmes answered. "Your red-headed idea was very new<br/>and effective."<br/><br/>"You'll see your pal again presently," said Jones. "He's quicker<br/>at climbing down holes than I am. Just hold out while I fix the<br/>derbies."<br/><br/>"I beg that you will not touch me with your filthy hands,"<br/>remarked our prisoner as the handcuffs clattered upon his wrists.<br/>"You may not be aware that I have royal blood in my veins. Have the<br/>goodness, also, when you address me always to say 'sir' and<br/>'please.'"<br/><br/>"All right," said Jones with a stare and a snigger. "Well, would<br/>you please, sir, march upstairs, where we can get a cab to carry<br/>your Highness to the police-station?"<br/><br/>"That is better," said John Clay serenely. He made a sweeping<br/>bow to the three of us and walked quietly off in the custody of the<br/>detective.<br/><br/>"Really, Mr. Holmes," said Mr. Merryweather as we followed them<br/>from the cellar, "I do not know how the bank can thank you or repay<br/>you. There is no doubt that you have detected and defeated in the<br/>most complete manner one of the most determined attempts at bank<br/>robbery that have ever come within my experience."<br/><br/>"I have had one or two little scores of my own to settle with<br/>Mr. John Clay," said Holmes. "I have been at some small expense<br/>over this matter, which I shall expect the bank to refund, but<br/>beyond that I am amply repaid by having had an experience which is<br/>in many ways unique, and by hearing the very remarkable narrative<br/>of the Red-headed League."<br/><br/>"You see, Watson," he explained in the early hours of the<br/>morning as we sat over a glass of whisky and soda in Baker Street,<br/>"it was perfectly obvious from the first that the only possible<br/>object of this rather fantastic business of the advertisement of<br/>the League, and the copying of the 'Encyclopaedia,' must be to get<br/>this not over-bright pawnbroker out of the way for a number of<br/>hours every day. It was a curious way of managing it, but, really,<br/>it would be difficult to suggest a better. The method was no doubt<br/>suggested to Clay's ingenious mind by the colour of his<br/>accomplice's hair. The 4 pounds a week was a lure which must draw<br/>him, and what was it to them, who were playing for thousands? They<br/>put in the advertisement, one rogue has the temporary office, the<br/>other rogue incites the man to apply for it, and together they<br/>manage to secure his absence every morning in the week. From the<br/>time that I heard of the assistant having come for half wages, it<br/>was obvious to me that he had some strong motive for securing the<br/>situation."<br/><br/>
