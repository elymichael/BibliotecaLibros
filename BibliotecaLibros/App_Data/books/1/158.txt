"It is fear, Mr. Holmes. It is terror." She raised her veil as
she spoke, and we could see that she was indeed in a pitiable state
of agitation, her face all drawn and grey, with restless frightened
eyes, like those of some hunted animal. Her features and figure
were those of a woman of thirty, but her hair was shot with
premature grey, and her expression was weary and haggard. Sherlock
Holmes ran her over with one of his quick, all-comprehensive
glances.

"You must not fear," said he soothingly, bending forward and
patting her forearm. "We shall soon set matters right, I have no
doubt. You have come in by train this morning, I see."

"You know me, then?"

"No, but I observe the second half of a return ticket in the
palm of your left glove. You must have started early, and yet you
had a good drive in a dog-cart, along heavy roads, before you
reached the station."

The lady gave a violent start and stared in bewilderment at my
companion.

"There is no mystery, my dear madam," said he, smiling. "The
left arm of your jacket is spattered with mud in no less than seven
places. The marks are perfectly fresh. There is no vehicle save a
dog-cart which throws up mud in that way, and then only when you
sit on the left-hand side of the driver."

"Whatever your reasons may be, you are perfectly correct," said
she. "I started from home before six, reached Leatherhead at twenty
past, and came in by the first train to Waterloo. Sir, I can stand
this strain no longer; I shall go mad if it continues. I have no
one to turn toâ€”none, save only one, who cares for me, and he, poor
fellow, can be of little aid. I have heard of you, Mr. Holmes; I
have heard of you from Mrs. Farintosh, whom you helped in the hour
of her sore need. It was from her that I had your address. Oh, sir,
do you not think that you could help me, too, and at least throw a
little light through the dense darkness which surrounds me? At
present it is out of my power to reward you for your services, but
in a month or six weeks I shall be married, with the control of my
own income, and then at least you shall not find me
ungrateful."

Holmes turned to his desk and, unlocking it, drew out a small
case-book, which he consulted.

"Farintosh," said he. "Ah yes, I recall the case; it was
concerned with an opal tiara. I think it was before your time,
Watson. I can only say, madam, that I shall be happy to devote the
same care to your case as I did to that of your friend. As to
reward, my profession is its own reward; but you are at liberty to
defray whatever expenses I may be put to, at the time which suits
you best. And now I beg that you will lay before us everything that
may help us in forming an opinion upon the matter."

"Alas!" replied our visitor, "the very horror of my situation
lies in the fact that my fears are so vague, and my suspicions
depend so entirely upon small points, which might seem trivial to
another, that even he to whom of all others I have a right to look
for help and advice looks upon all that I tell him about it as the
fancies of a nervous woman. He does not say so, but I can read it
from his soothing answers and averted eyes. But I have heard, Mr.
Holmes, that you can see deeply into the manifold wickedness of the
human heart. You may advise me how to walk amid the dangers which
encompass me."
