"Thank you," said my patient. "but I have felt another man since<br/>the doctor bandaged me, and I think that your breakfast has<br/>completed the cure. I shall take up as little of your valuable time<br/>as possible, so I shall start at once upon my peculiar<br/>experiences."<br/><br/>Holmes sat in his big armchair with the weary, heavy-lidded<br/>expression which veiled his keen and eager nature, while I sat<br/>opposite to him, and we listened in silence to the strange story<br/>which our visitor detailed to us.<br/><br/>"You must know," said he, "that I am an orphan and a bachelor,<br/>residing alone in lodgings in London. By profession I am a<br/>hydraulic engineer, and I have had considerable experience of my<br/>work during the seven years that I was apprenticed to Venner &amp;<br/>Matheson, the well-known firm, of Greenwich. Two years ago, having<br/>served my time, and having also come into a fair sum of money<br/>through my poor father's death, I determined to start in business<br/>for myself and took professional chambers in Victoria Street.<br/><br/>"I suppose that everyone finds his first independent start in<br/>business a dreary experience. To me it has been exceptionally so.<br/>During two years I have had three consultations and one small job,<br/>and that is absolutely all that my profession has brought me. My<br/>gross takings amount to 27 pounds 10s. Every day, from nine in the<br/>morning until four in the afternoon, I waited in my little den,<br/>until at last my heart began to sink, and I came to believe that I<br/>should never have any practice at all.<br/><br/>"Yesterday, however, just as I was thinking of leaving the<br/>office, my clerk entered to say there was a gentleman waiting who<br/>wished to see me upon business. He brought up a card, too, with the<br/>name of 'Colonel Lysander Stark' engraved upon it. Close at his<br/>heels came the colonel himself, a man rather over the middle size,<br/>but of an exceeding thinness. I do not think that I have ever seen<br/>so thin a man. His whole face sharpened away into nose and chin,<br/>and the skin of his cheeks was drawn quite tense over his<br/>outstanding bones. Yet this emaciation seemed to be his natural<br/>habit, and due to no disease, for his eye was bright, his step<br/>brisk, and his bearing assured. He was plainly but neatly dressed,<br/>and his age, I should judge, would be nearer forty than thirty.<br/><br/>"'Mr. Hatherley?' said he, with something of a German accent.<br/>'You have been recommended to me, Mr. Hatherley, as being a man who<br/>is not only proficient in his profession but is also discreet and<br/>capable of preserving a secret.'<br/><br/>"I bowed, feeling as flattered as any young man would at such an<br/>address. 'May I ask who it was who gave me so good a<br/>character?'<br/><br/>"'Well, perhaps it is better that I should not tell you that<br/>just at this moment. I have it from the same source that you are<br/>both an orphan and a bachelor and are residing alone in<br/>London.'<br/><br/>"'That is quite correct,' I answered; 'but you will excuse me if<br/>I say that I cannot see how all this bears upon my professional<br/>qualifications. I understand that it was on a professional matter<br/>that you wished to speak to me?'<br/><br/>"'Undoubtedly so. But you will find that all I say is really to<br/>the point. I have a professional commission for you, but absolute<br/>secrecy is quite essentialâ€”absolute secrecy, you understand, and of<br/>course we may expect that more from a man who is alone than from<br/>one who lives in the bosom of his family.'<br/><br/>"'If I promise to keep a secret,' said I, 'you may absolutely<br/>depend upon my doing so.'<br/>
