<br/>"I took the lamp from him, and I examined the machine very<br/>thoroughly. It was indeed a gigantic one, and capable of exercising<br/>enormous pressure. When I passed outside, however, and pressed down<br/>the levers which controlled it, I knew at once by the whishing<br/>sound that there was a slight leakage, which allowed a<br/>regurgitation of water through one of the side cylinders. An<br/>examination showed that one of the india-rubber bands which was<br/>round the head of a driving-rod had shrunk so as not quite to fill<br/>the socket along which it worked. This was clearly the cause of the<br/>loss of power, and I pointed it out to my companions, who followed<br/>my remarks very carefully and asked several practical questions as<br/>to how they should proceed to set it right. When I had made it<br/>clear to them, I returned to the main chamber of the machine and<br/>took a good look at it to satisfy my own curiosity. It was obvious<br/>at a glance that the story of the fuller's-earth was the merest<br/>fabrication, for it would be absurd to suppose that so powerful an<br/>engine could be designed for so inadequate a purpose. The walls<br/>were of wood, but the floor consisted of a large iron trough, and<br/>when I came to examine it I could see a crust of metallic deposit<br/>all over it. I had stooped and was scraping at this to see exactly<br/>what it was when I heard a muttered exclamation in German and saw<br/>the cadaverous face of the colonel looking down at me.<br/><br/>"'What are you doing there?' he asked.<br/><br/>"I felt angry at having been tricked by so elaborate a story as<br/>that which he had told me. 'I was admiring your fuller's-earth,'<br/>said I; 'I think that I should be better able to advise you as to<br/>your machine if I knew what the exact purpose was for which it was<br/>used.'<br/><br/>"The instant that I uttered the words I regretted the rashness<br/>of my speech. His face set hard, and a baleful light sprang up in<br/>his grey eyes.<br/><br/>"'Very well,' said he, 'you shall know all about the machine.'<br/>He took a step backward, slammed the little door, and turned the<br/>key in the lock. I rushed towards it and pulled at the handle, but<br/>it was quite secure, and did not give in the least to my kicks and<br/>shoves. 'Hullo!' I yelled. 'Hullo! Colonel! Let me out!'<br/><br/>"And then suddenly in the silence I heard a sound which sent my<br/>heart into my mouth. It was the clank of the levers and the swish<br/>of the leaking cylinder. He had set the engine at work. The lamp<br/>still stood upon the floor where I had placed it when examining the<br/>trough. By its light I saw that the black ceiling was coming down<br/>upon me, slowly, jerkily, but, as none knew better than myself,<br/>with a force which must within a minute grind me to a shapeless<br/>pulp. I threw myself, screaming, against the door, and dragged with<br/>my nails at the lock. I implored the colonel to let me out, but the<br/>remorseless clanking of the levers drowned my cries. The ceiling<br/>was only a foot or two above my head, and with my hand upraised I<br/>could feel its hard, rough surface. Then it flashed through my mind<br/>that the pain of my death would depend very much upon the position<br/>in which I met it. If I lay on my face the weight would come upon<br/>my spine, and I shuddered to think of that dreadful snap. Easier<br/>the other way, perhaps; and yet, had I the nerve to lie and look up<br/>at that deadly black shadow wavering down upon me? Already I was<br/>unable to stand erect, when my eye caught something which brought a<br/>gush of hope back to my heart.<br/><br/>"I have said that though the floor and ceiling were of iron, the<br/>walls were of wood. As I gave a last hurried glance around, I saw a<br/>thin line of yellow light between two of the boards, which<br/>broadened and broadened as a small panel was pushed backward. For<br/>an instant I could hardly believe that here was indeed a door which<br/>led away from death. The next instant I threw myself through, and<br/>lay half-fainting upon the other side. The panel had closed again<br/>behind me, but the crash of the lamp, and a few moments afterwards<br/>the clang of the two slabs of metal, told me how narrow had been my<br/>escape.<br/><br/>"I was recalled to myself by a frantic plucking at my wrist, and<br/>I found myself lying upon the stone floor of a narrow corridor,<br/>while a woman bent over me and tugged at me with her left hand,<br/>while she held a candle in her right. It was the same good friend<br/>whose warning I had so foolishly rejected.<br/><br/>"'Come! come!' she cried breathlessly. 'They will be here in a<br/>moment. They will see that you are not there. Oh, do not waste the<br/>so-precious time, but come!'<br/><br/>"This time, at least, I did not scorn her advice. I staggered to<br/>my feet and ran with her along the corridor and down a winding<br/>stair. The latter led to another broad passage, and just as we<br/>reached it we heard the sound of running feet and the shouting of<br/>two voices, one answering the other from the floor on which we were<br/>and from the one beneath. My guide stopped and looked about her<br/>like one who is at her wit's end. Then she threw open a door which<br/>led into a bedroom, through the window of which the moon was<br/>shining brightly.<br/><br/>
