"Get out!" said he.<br/><br/>"What, sir! Oh, Heaven bless you!"<br/><br/>"No more words. Get out!"<br/><br/>And no more words were needed. There was a rush, a clatter upon<br/>the stairs, the bang of a door, and the crisp rattle of running<br/>footfalls from the street.<br/><br/>"After all, Watson," said Holmes, reaching up his hand for his<br/>clay pipe, "I am not retained by the police to supply their<br/>deficiencies. If Horner were in danger it would be another thing;<br/>but this fellow will not appear against him, and the case must<br/>collapse. I suppose that I am commuting a felony, but it is just<br/>possible that I am saving a soul. This fellow will not go wrong<br/>again; he is too terribly frightened. Send him to gaol now, and you<br/>make him a gaol-bird for life. Besides, it is the season of<br/>forgiveness. Chance has put in our way a most singular and<br/>whimsical problem, and its solution is its own reward. If you will<br/>have the goodness to touch the bell, Doctor, we will begin another<br/>investigation, in which, also a bird will be the chief<br/>feature."<br/><br/><br/><br/>
