"And I."<br/><br/>"You will excuse this mask," continued our strange visitor. "The<br/>august person who employs me wishes his agent to be unknown to you,<br/>and I may confess at once that the title by which I have just<br/>called myself is not exactly my own."<br/><br/>"I was aware of it," said Holmes dryly.<br/><br/>"The circumstances are of great delicacy, and every precaution<br/>has to be taken to quench what might grow to be an immense scandal<br/>and seriously compromise one of the reigning families of Europe. To<br/>speak plainly, the matter implicates the great House of Ormstein,<br/>hereditary kings of Bohemia."<br/><br/>"I was also aware of that," murmured Holmes, settling himself<br/>down in his armchair and closing his eyes.<br/><br/>Our visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid,<br/>lounging figure of the man who had been no doubt depicted to him as<br/>the most incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in Europe.<br/>Holmes slowly reopened his eyes and looked impatiently at his<br/>gigantic client.<br/><br/>"If your Majesty would condescend to state your case," he<br/>remarked, "I should be better able to advise you."<br/><br/>The man sprang from his chair and paced up and down the room in<br/>uncontrollable agitation. Then, with a gesture of desperation, he<br/>tore the mask from his face and hurled it upon the ground. "You are<br/>right," he cried; "I am the King. Why should I attempt to conceal<br/>it?"<br/><br/>"Why, indeed?" murmured Holmes. "Your Majesty had not spoken<br/>before I was aware that I was addressing Wilhelm Gottsreich<br/>Sigismond von Ormstein, Grand Duke of Cassel-Felstein, and<br/>hereditary King of Bohemia."<br/><br/>"But you can understand," said our strange visitor, sitting down<br/>once more and passing his hand over his high white forehead, "you<br/>can understand that I am not accustomed to doing such business in<br/>my own person. Yet the matter was so delicate that I could not<br/>confide it to an agent without putting myself in his power. I have<br/>come incognito from Prague for the purpose of consulting you."<br/><br/>"Then, pray consult," said Holmes, shutting his eyes once<br/>more.<br/>
