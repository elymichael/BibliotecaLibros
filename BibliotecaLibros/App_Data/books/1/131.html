<br/>"No crime, but a very great error has been committed," said<br/>Holmes. "You would have done better to have trusted you wife."<br/><br/>"It was not the wife; it was the children," groaned the<br/>prisoner. "God help me, I would not have them ashamed of their<br/>father. My God! What an exposure! What can I do?"<br/><br/>Sherlock Holmes sat down beside him on the couch and patted him<br/>kindly on the shoulder.<br/><br/>"If you leave it to a court of law to clear the matter up," said<br/>he, "of course you can hardly avoid publicity. On the other hand,<br/>if you convince the police authorities that there is no possible<br/>case against you, I do not know that there is any reason that the<br/>details should find their way into the papers. Inspector Bradstreet<br/>would, I am sure, make notes upon anything which you might tell us<br/>and submit it to the proper authorities. The case would then never<br/>go into court at all."<br/><br/>"God bless you!" cried the prisoner passionately. "I would have<br/>endured imprisonment, ay, even execution, rather than have left my<br/>miserable secret as a family blot to my children.<br/><br/>"You are the first who have ever heard my story. My father was a<br/>schoolmaster in Chesterfield, where I received an excellent<br/>education. I travelled in my youth, took to the stage, and finally<br/>became a reporter on an evening paper in London. One day my editor<br/>wished to have a series of articles upon begging in the metropolis,<br/>and I volunteered to supply them. There was the point from which<br/>all my adventures started. It was only by trying begging as an<br/>amateur that I could get the facts upon which to base my articles.<br/>When an actor I had, of course, learned all the secrets of making<br/>up, and had been famous in the green-room for my skill. I took<br/>advantage now of my attainments. I painted my face, and to make<br/>myself as pitiable as possible I made a good scar and fixed one<br/>side of my lip in a twist by the aid of a small slip of<br/>flesh-coloured plaster. Then with a red head of hair, and an<br/>appropriate dress, I took my station in the business part of the<br/>city, ostensibly as a match-seller but really as a beggar. For<br/>seven hours I plied my trade, and when I returned home in the<br/>evening I found to my surprise that I had received no less than<br/>26s. 4d.<br/><br/>"I wrote my articles and thought little more of the matter<br/>until, some time later, I backed a bill for a friend and had a writ<br/>served upon me for 25 pounds. I was at my wit's end where to get<br/>the money, but a sudden idea came to me. I begged a fortnight's<br/>grace from the creditor, asked for a holiday from my employers, and<br/>spent the time in begging in the City under my disguise. In ten<br/>days I had the money and had paid the debt.<br/><br/>"Well, you can imagine how hard it was to settle down to arduous<br/>work at 2 pounds a week when I knew that I could earn as much in a<br/>day by smearing my face with a little paint, laying my cap on the<br/>ground, and sitting still. It was a long fight between my pride and<br/>the money, but the dollars won at last, and I threw up reporting<br/>and sat day after day in the corner which I had first chosen,<br/>inspiring pity by my ghastly face and filling my pockets with<br/>coppers. Only one man knew my secret. He was the keeper of a low<br/>den in which I used to lodge in Swandam Lane, where I could every<br/>morning emerge as a squalid beggar and in the evenings transform<br/>myself into a well-dressed man about town. This fellow, a Lascar,<br/>was well paid by me for his rooms, so that I knew that my secret<br/>was safe in his possession.<br/><br/>"Well, very soon I found that I was saving considerable sums of<br/>money. I do not mean that any beggar in the streets of London could<br/>earn 700 pounds a year—which is less than my average takings—but I<br/>had exceptional advantages in my power of making up, and also in a<br/>facility of repartee, which improved by practice and made me quite<br/>a recognised character in the City. All day a stream of pennies,<br/>varied by silver, poured in upon me, and it was a very bad day in<br/>which I failed to take 2 pounds.<br/><br/>"As I grew richer I grew more ambitious, took a house in the<br/>country, and eventually married, without anyone having a suspicion<br/>as to my real occupation. My dear wife knew that I had business in<br/>the City. She little knew what.<br/><br/>
