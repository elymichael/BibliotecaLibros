"Then let us do so. Watson, I fear that you will find it very<br/>slow, but I shall only be away a couple of hours."<br/><br/>I walked down to the station with them, and then wandered<br/>through the streets of the little town, finally returning to the<br/>hotel, where I lay upon the sofa and tried to interest myself in a<br/>yellow-backed novel. The puny plot of the story was so thin,<br/>however, when compared to the deep mystery through which we were<br/>groping, and I found my attention wander so continually from the<br/>action to the fact, that I at last flung it across the room and<br/>gave myself up entirely to a consideration of the events of the<br/>day. Supposing that this unhappy young man's story were absolutely<br/>true, then what hellish thing, what absolutely unforeseen and<br/>extraordinary calamity could have occurred between the time when he<br/>parted from his father, and the moment when, drawn back by his<br/>screams, he rushed into the glade? It was something terrible and<br/>deadly. What could it be? Might not the nature of the injuries<br/>reveal something to my medical instincts? I rang the bell and<br/>called for the weekly county paper, which contained a verbatim<br/>account of the inquest. In the surgeon's deposition it was stated<br/>that the posterior third of the left parietal bone and the left<br/>half of the occipital bone had been shattered by a heavy blow from<br/>a blunt weapon. I marked the spot upon my own head. Clearly such a<br/>blow must have been struck from behind. That was to some extent in<br/>favour of the accused, as when seen quarrelling he was face to face<br/>with his father. Still, it did not go for very much, for the older<br/>man might have turned his back before the blow fell. Still, it<br/>might be worth while to call Holmes' attention to it. Then there<br/>was the peculiar dying reference to a rat. What could that mean? It<br/>could not be delirium. A man dying from a sudden blow does not<br/>commonly become delirious. No, it was more likely to be an attempt<br/>to explain how he met his fate. But what could it indicate? I<br/>cudgelled my brains to find some possible explanation. And then the<br/>incident of the grey cloth seen by young McCarthy. If that were<br/>true the murderer must have dropped some part of his dress,<br/>presumably his overcoat, in his flight, and must have had the<br/>hardihood to return and to carry it away at the instant when the<br/>son was kneeling with his back turned not a dozen paces off. What a<br/>tissue of mysteries and improbabilities the whole thing was! I did<br/>not wonder at Lestrade's opinion, and yet I had so much faith in<br/>Sherlock Holmes' insight that I could not lose hope as long as<br/>every fresh fact seemed to strengthen his conviction of young<br/>McCarthy's innocence.<br/><br/>It was late before Sherlock Holmes returned. He came back alone,<br/>for Lestrade was staying in lodgings in the town.<br/><br/>"The glass still keeps very high," he remarked as he sat down.<br/>"It is of importance that it should not rain before we are able to<br/>go over the ground. On the other hand, a man should be at his very<br/>best and keenest for such nice work as that, and I did not wish to<br/>do it when fagged by a long journey. I have seen young<br/>McCarthy."<br/><br/>"And what did you learn from him?"<br/><br/>"Nothing."<br/><br/>"Could he throw no light?"<br/><br/>"None at all. I was inclined to think at one time that he knew<br/>who had done it and was screening him or her, but I am convinced<br/>now that he is as puzzled as everyone else. He is not a very<br/>quick-witted youth, though comely to look at and, I should think,<br/>sound at heart."<br/><br/>"I cannot admire his taste," I remarked, "if it is indeed a fact<br/>that he was averse to a marriage with so charming a young lady as<br/>this Miss Turner."<br/><br/>"Ah, thereby hangs a rather painful tale. This fellow is madly,<br/>insanely, in love with her, but some two years ago, when he was<br/>only a lad, and before he really knew her, for she had been away<br/>five years at a boarding-school, what does the idiot do but get<br/>into the clutches of a barmaid in Bristol and marry her at a<br/>registry office? No one knows a word of the matter, but you can<br/>imagine how maddening it must be to him to be upbraided for not<br/>doing what he would give his very eyes to do, but what he knows to<br/>be absolutely impossible. It was sheer frenzy of this sort which<br/>made him throw his hands up into the air when his father, at their<br/>last interview, was goading him on to propose to Miss Turner. On<br/>the other hand, he had no means of supporting himself, and his<br/>father, who was by all accounts a very hard man, would have thrown<br/>him over utterly had he known the truth. It was with his barmaid<br/>wife that he had spent the last three days in Bristol, and his<br/>father did not know where he was. Mark that point. It is of<br/>importance. Good has come out of evil, however, for the barmaid,<br/>finding from the papers that he is in serious trouble and likely to<br/>be hanged, has thrown him over utterly and has written to him to<br/>say that she has a husband already in the Bermuda Dockyard, so that<br/>there is really no tie between them. I think that that bit of news<br/>has consoled young McCarthy for all that he has suffered."<br/><br/>"But if he is innocent, who has done it?"<br/>
