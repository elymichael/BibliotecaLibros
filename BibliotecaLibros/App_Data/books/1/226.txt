"'The firm does so when the security is good.' I answered.

"'It is absolutely essential to me,' said he, 'that I should
have 50,000 pounds at once. I could, of course, borrow so trifling
a sum ten times over from my friends, but I much prefer to make it
a matter of business and to carry out that business myself. In my
position you can readily understand that it is unwise to place

"'For how long, may I ask, do you want this sum?' I asked.

"'Next Monday I have a large sum due to me, and I shall then
most certainly repay what you advance, with whatever interest you

he had named. 'There are thirty-nine enormous beryls,' said he,
'and the price of the gold chasing is incalculable. The lowest
estimate would put the worth of the coronet at double the sum which
I have asked. I am prepared to leave it with you as my
security.'

"I took the precious case into my hands and looked in some
perplexity from it to my illustrious client.

"'You doubt its value?' he asked.

"'Not at all. I only doubtâ€”'
