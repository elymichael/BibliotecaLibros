You see this little book?"<br/><br/>"Well?"<br/><br/>"That's the list of the folk from whom I buy. D'you see? Well,<br/>then, here on this page are the country folk, and the numbers after<br/>their names are where their accounts are in the big ledger. Now,<br/>then! You see this other page in red ink? Well, that is a list of<br/>my town suppliers. Now, look at that third name. Just read it out<br/>to me."<br/><br/>"Mrs. Oakshott, 117, Brixton Roadâ€”249," read Holmes.<br/><br/>"Quite so.

"Here you are, 'Mrs.<br/>Oakshott, 117, Brixton Road, egg and poultry supplier.'"<br/><br/>"Now, then, what's the last entry?"<br/><br/>"'December 22nd. Twenty-four geese at 7s. 6d.'"<br/><br/>
