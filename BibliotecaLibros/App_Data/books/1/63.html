<br/>"Thank you. And your address?"<br/><br/>"No. 31 Lyon Place, Camberwell."<br/><br/>"Mr. Angel's address you never had, I understand. Where is your<br/>father's place of business?"<br/><br/>"He travels for Westhouse &amp; Marbank, the great claret<br/>importers of Fenchurch Street."<br/><br/>"Thank you. You have made your statement very clearly. You will<br/>leave the papers here, and remember the advice which I have given<br/>you. Let the whole incident be a sealed book, and do not allow it<br/>to affect your life."<br/><br/>"You are very kind, Mr. Holmes, but I cannot do that. I shall be<br/>true to Hosmer. He shall find me ready when he comes back."<br/><br/>For all the preposterous hat and the vacuous face, there was<br/>something noble in the simple faith of our visitor which compelled<br/>our respect. She laid her little bundle of papers upon the table<br/>and went her way, with a promise to come again whenever she might<br/>be summoned.<br/><br/>Sherlock Holmes sat silent for a few minutes with his fingertips<br/>still pressed together, his legs stretched out in front of him, and<br/>his gaze directed upward to the ceiling. Then he took down from the<br/>rack the old and oily clay pipe, which was to him as a counsellor,<br/>and, having lit it, he leaned back in his chair, with the thick<br/>blue cloud-wreaths spinning up from him, and a look of infinite<br/>languor in his face.<br/><br/>"Quite an interesting study, that maiden," he observed. "I found<br/>her more interesting than her little problem, which, by the way, is<br/>rather a trite one. You will find parallel cases, if you consult my<br/>index, in Andover in '77, and there was something of the sort at<br/>The Hague last year. Old as is the idea, however, there were one or<br/>two details which were new to me. But the maiden herself was most<br/>instructive."<br/><br/>"You appeared to read a good deal upon her which was quite<br/>invisible to me," I remarked.<br/><br/>
