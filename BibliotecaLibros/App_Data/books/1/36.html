"Ah, of course, I forgot that. But the writing?"<br/><br/>"What else can be indicated by that right cuff so very shiny for<br/>five inches, and the left one with the smooth patch near the elbow<br/>where you rest it upon the desk?"<br/><br/>"Well, but China?"<br/><br/>"The fish that you have tattooed immediately above your right<br/>wrist could only have been done in China. I have made a small study<br/>of tattoo marks and have even contributed to the literature of the<br/>subject. That trick of staining the fishes' scales of a delicate<br/>pink is quite peculiar to China. When, in addition, I see a Chinese<br/>coin hanging from your watch-chain, the matter becomes even more<br/>simple."<br/><br/>Mr. Jabez Wilson laughed heavily. "Well, I never!" said he. "I<br/>thought at first that you had done something clever, but I see that<br/>there was nothing in it, after all."<br/><br/>"I begin to think, Watson," said Holmes, "that I make a mistake<br/>in explaining. 'Omne ignotum pro magnifico,' you know, and my poor<br/>little reputation, such as it is, will suffer shipwreck if I am so<br/>candid. Can you not find the advertisement, Mr. Wilson?"<br/><br/>"Yes, I have got it now," he answered with his thick red finger<br/>planted halfway down the column. "Here it is. This is what began it<br/>all. You just read it for yourself, sir."<br/><br/>I took the paper from him and read as follows:<br/><br/>"TO THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE: On account of the bequest of the late<br/>Ezekiah Hopkins, of Lebanon, Pennsylvania, U. S. A., there is now<br/>another vacancy open which entitles a member of the League to a<br/>salary of 4 pounds a week for purely nominal services. All<br/>red-headed men who are sound in body and mind and above the age of<br/>twenty-one years, are eligible. Apply in person on Monday, at<br/>eleven o'clock, to Duncan Ross, at the offices of the League, 7<br/>Pope's Court, Fleet Street."<br/><br/>"What on earth does this mean?" I ejaculated after I had twice<br/>read over the extraordinary announcement.<br/><br/>Holmes chuckled and wriggled in his chair, as was his habit when<br/>in high spirits. "It is a little off the beaten track, isn't it?"<br/>said he. "And now, Mr. Wilson, off you go at scratch and tell us<br/>all about yourself, your household, and the effect which this<br/>advertisement had upon your fortunes. You will first make a note,<br/>Doctor, of the paper and the date."<br/>
