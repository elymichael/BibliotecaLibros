<br/><br/><br/>We were seated at breakfast one morning, my wife and I, when the<br/>maid brought in a telegram. It was from Sherlock Holmes and ran in<br/>this way:<br/><br/>"Have you a couple of days to spare? Have just been wired for<br/>from the west of England in connection with Boscombe Valley<br/>tragedy. Shall be glad if you will come with me. Air and scenery<br/>perfect. Leave Paddington by the 11:15."<br/><br/>"What do you say, dear?" said my wife, looking across at me.<br/>"Will you go?"<br/><br/>"I really don't know what to say. I have a fairly long list at<br/>present."<br/><br/>"Oh, Anstruther would do your work for you. You have been<br/>looking a little pale lately. I think that the change would do you<br/>good, and you are always so interested in Mr. Sherlock Holmes'<br/>cases."<br/><br/>"I should be ungrateful if I were not, seeing what I gained<br/>through one of them," I answered. "But if I am to go, I must pack<br/>at once, for I have only half an hour."<br/><br/>My experience of camp life in Afghanistan had at least had the<br/>effect of making me a prompt and ready traveller. My wants were few<br/>and simple, so that in less than the time stated I was in a cab<br/>with my valise, rattling away to Paddington Station. Sherlock<br/>Holmes was pacing up and down the platform, his tall, gaunt figure<br/>made even gaunter and taller by his long grey travelling-cloak and<br/>close-fitting cloth cap.<br/><br/>"It is really very good of you to come, Watson," said he. "It<br/>makes a considerable difference to me, having someone with me on<br/>whom I can thoroughly rely. Local aid is always either worthless or<br/>else biassed. If you will keep the two corner seats I shall get the<br/>tickets."<br/><br/>We had the carriage to ourselves save for an immense litter of<br/>papers which Holmes had brought with him. Among these he rummaged<br/>and read, with intervals of note-taking and of meditation, until we<br/>were past Reading. Then he suddenly rolled them all into a gigantic<br/>ball and tossed them up onto the rack.<br/><br/>"Have you heard anything of the case?" he asked.<br/>
