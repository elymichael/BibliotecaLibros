<br/>"Undoubtedly. It is quite clear that the colonel was a cool and<br/>desperate man, who was absolutely determined that nothing should<br/>stand in the way of his little game, like those out-and-out pirates<br/>who will leave no survivor from a captured ship. Well, every moment<br/>now is precious, so if you feel equal to it we shall go down to<br/>Scotland Yard at once as a preliminary to starting for Eyford."<br/><br/>Some three hours or so afterwards we were all in the train<br/>together, bound from Reading to the little Berkshire village. There<br/>were Sherlock Holmes, the hydraulic engineer, Inspector Bradstreet,<br/>of Scotland Yard, a plain-clothes man, and myself. Bradstreet had<br/>spread an ordnance map of the county out upon the seat and was busy<br/>with his compasses drawing a circle with Eyford for its centre.<br/><br/>"There you are," said he. "That circle is drawn at a radius of<br/>ten miles from the village. The place we want must be somewhere<br/>near that line. You said ten miles, I think, sir."<br/><br/>"It was an hour's good drive."<br/><br/>"And you think that they brought you back all that way when you<br/>were unconscious?"<br/><br/>"They must have done so. I have a confused memory, too, of<br/>having been lifted and conveyed somewhere."<br/><br/>"What I cannot understand," said I, "is why they should have<br/>spared you when they found you lying fainting in the garden.<br/>Perhaps the villain was softened by the woman's entreaties."<br/><br/>"I hardly think that likely. I never saw a more inexorable face<br/>in my life."<br/><br/>"Oh, we shall soon clear up all that," said Bradstreet. "Well, I<br/>have drawn my circle, and I only wish I knew at what point upon it<br/>the folk that we are in search of are to be found."<br/><br/>"I think I could lay my finger on it," said Holmes quietly.<br/><br/>
