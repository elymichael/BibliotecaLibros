"Was your sister dressed?"

"No, she was in her night-dress. In her right hand was found the
charred stump of a match, and in her left a match-box."

"Showing that she had struck a light and looked about her when
the alarm took place. That is important. And what conclusions did
the coroner come to?"

"He investigated the case with great care, for Dr. Roylott's
conduct had long been notorious in the county, but he was unable to
find any satisfactory cause of death. My evidence showed that the
door had been fastened upon the inner side, and the windows were
blocked by old-fashioned shutters with broad iron bars, which were
secured every night. The walls were carefully sounded, and were
shown to be quite solid all round, and the flooring was also
thoroughly examined, with the same result. The chimney is wide, but
is barred up by four large staples. It is certain, therefore, that
my sister was quite alone when she met her end. Besides, there were
no marks of any violence upon her."

"How about poison?"

"The doctors examined her for it, but without success."

"What do you think that this unfortunate lady died of,
then?"

"It is my belief that she died of pure fear and nervous shock,
though what it was that frightened her I cannot imagine."

"Were there gipsies in the plantation at the time?"

"Yes, there are nearly always some there."
