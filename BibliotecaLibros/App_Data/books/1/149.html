"Quite so. There you are. And underneath?"<br/><br/>"'Sold to Mr. Windigate of the Alpha, at 12s.'"<br/><br/>"What have you to say now?"<br/><br/>Sherlock Holmes looked deeply chagrined. He drew a sovereign<br/>from his pocket and threw it down upon the slab, turning away with<br/>the air of a man whose disgust is too deep for words. A few yards<br/>off he stopped under a lamp-post and laughed in the hearty,<br/>noiseless fashion which was peculiar to him.<br/><br/>"When you see a man with whiskers of that cut and the 'Pink 'un'<br/>protruding out of his pocket, you can always draw him by a bet,"<br/>said he. "I daresay that if I had put 100 pounds down in front of<br/>him, that man would not have given me such complete information as<br/>was drawn from him by the idea that he was doing me on a wager.<br/>Well, Watson, we are, I fancy, nearing the end of our quest, and<br/>the only point which remains to be determined is whether we should<br/>go on to this Mrs. Oakshott to-night, or whether we should reserve<br/>it for to-morrow. It is clear from what that surly fellow said that<br/>there are others besides ourselves who are anxious about the<br/>matter, and I shouldâ€”"<br/><br/>His remarks were suddenly cut short by a loud hubbub which broke<br/>out from the stall which we had just left. Turning round we saw a<br/>little rat-faced fellow standing in the centre of the circle of<br/>yellow light which was thrown by the swinging lamp, while<br/>Breckinridge, the salesman, framed in the door of his stall, was<br/>shaking his fists fiercely at the cringing figure.<br/><br/>"I've had enough of you and your geese," he shouted. "I wish you<br/>were all at the devil together. If you come pestering me any more<br/>with your silly talk I'll set the dog at you. You bring Mrs.<br/>Oakshott here and I'll answer her, but what have you to do with it?<br/>Did I buy the geese off you?"<br/><br/>"No; but one of them was mine all the same," whined the little<br/>man.<br/><br/>"Well, then, ask Mrs. Oakshott for it."<br/><br/>"She told me to ask you."<br/><br/>"Well, you can ask the King of Proosia, for all I care. I've had<br/>enough of it. Get out of this!" He rushed fiercely forward, and the<br/>inquirer flitted away into the darkness.<br/>
