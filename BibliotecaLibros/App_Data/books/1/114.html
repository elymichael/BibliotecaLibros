"Of what day?"<br/><br/>"Of Friday, June 19th."<br/><br/>"Good heavens! I thought it was Wednesday. It is Wednesday. What<br/>d'you want to frighten a chap for?" He sank his face onto his arms<br/>and began to sob in a high treble key.<br/><br/>"I tell you that it is Friday, man. Your wife has been waiting<br/>this two days for you. You should be ashamed of yourself!"<br/><br/>"So I am. But you've got mixed, Watson, for I have only been<br/>here a few hours, three pipes, four pipes—I forget how many. But<br/>I'll go home with you. I wouldn't frighten Kate—poor little Kate.<br/>Give me your hand! Have you a cab?"<br/><br/>"Yes, I have one waiting."<br/><br/>"Then I shall go in it. But I must owe something. Find what I<br/>owe, Watson. I am all off colour. I can do nothing for myself."<br/><br/>I walked down the narrow passage between the double row of<br/>sleepers, holding my breath to keep out the vile, stupefying fumes<br/>of the drug, and looking about for the manager. As I passed the<br/>tall man who sat by the brazier I felt a sudden pluck at my skirt,<br/>and a low voice whispered, "Walk past me, and then look back at<br/>me." The words fell quite distinctly upon my ear. I glanced down.<br/>They could only have come from the old man at my side, and yet he<br/>sat now as absorbed as ever, very thin, very wrinkled, bent with<br/>age, an opium pipe dangling down from between his knees, as though<br/>it had dropped in sheer lassitude from his fingers. I took two<br/>steps forward and looked back. It took all my self-control to<br/>prevent me from breaking out into a cry of astonishment. He had<br/>turned his back so that none could see him but I. His form had<br/>filled out, his wrinkles were gone, the dull eyes had regained<br/>their fire, and there, sitting by the fire and grinning at my<br/>surprise, was none other than Sherlock Holmes. He made a slight<br/>motion to me to approach him, and instantly, as he turned his face<br/>half round to the company once more, subsided into a doddering,<br/>loose-lipped senility.<br/><br/>"Holmes!" I whispered, "what on earth are you doing in this<br/>den?"<br/><br/>"As low as you can," he answered; "I have excellent ears. If you<br/>would have the great kindness to get rid of that sottish friend of<br/>yours I should be exceedingly glad to have a little talk with<br/>you."<br/><br/>"I have a cab outside."<br/>
