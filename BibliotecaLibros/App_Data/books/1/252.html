<br/>"'I am afraid that it is quite essential,' said he. 'It is a<br/>little fancy of my wife's, and ladies' fancies, you know, madam,<br/>ladies' fancies must be consulted. And so you won't cut your<br/>hair?'<br/><br/>"'No, sir, I really could not,' I answered firmly.<br/><br/>"'Ah, very well; then that quite settles the matter. It is a<br/>pity, because in other respects you would really have done very<br/>nicely. In that case, Miss Stoper, I had best inspect a few more of<br/>your young ladies.'<br/><br/>"The manageress had sat all this while busy with her papers<br/>without a word to either of us, but she glanced at me now with so<br/>much annoyance upon her face that I could not help suspecting that<br/>she had lost a handsome commission through my refusal.<br/><br/>"'Do you desire your name to be kept upon the books?' she<br/>asked.<br/><br/>"'If you please, Miss Stoper.'<br/><br/>"'Well, really, it seems rather useless, since you refuse the<br/>most excellent offers in this fashion,' said she sharply. 'You can<br/>hardly expect us to exert ourselves to find another such opening<br/>for you. Good-day to you, Miss Hunter.' She struck a gong upon the<br/>table, and I was shown out by the page.<br/><br/>"Well, Mr. Holmes, when I got back to my lodgings and found<br/>little enough in the cupboard, and two or three bills upon the<br/>table. I began to ask myself whether I had not done a very foolish<br/>thing. After all, if these people had strange fads and expected<br/>obedience on the most extraordinary matters, they were at least<br/>ready to pay for their eccentricity. Very few governesses in<br/>England are getting 100 pounds a year. Besides, what use was my<br/>hair to me? Many people are improved by wearing it short and<br/>perhaps I should be among the number. Next day I was inclined to<br/>think that I had made a mistake, and by the day after I was sure of<br/>it. I had almost overcome my pride so far as to go back to the<br/>agency and inquire whether the place was still open when I received<br/>this letter from the gentleman himself. I have it here and I will<br/>read it to you:<br/><br/>"'The Copper Beeches, near Winchester. "'DEAR MISS HUNTER:â€”Miss<br/>Stoper has very kindly given me your address, and I write from here<br/>to ask you whether you have reconsidered your decision. My wife is<br/>very anxious that you should come, for she has been much attracted<br/>by my description of you. We are willing to give 30 pounds a<br/>quarter, or 120 pounds a year, so as to recompense you for any<br/>little inconvenience which our fads may cause you. They are not<br/>very exacting, after all. My wife is fond of a particular shade of<br/>electric blue and would like you to wear such a dress indoors in<br/>the morning. You need not, however, go to the expense of purchasing<br/>one, as we have one belonging to my dear daughter Alice (now in<br/>Philadelphia), which would, I should think, fit you very well.<br/>Then, as to sitting here or there, or amusing yourself in any<br/>manner indicated, that need cause you no inconvenience. As regards<br/>your hair, it is no doubt a pity, especially as I could not help<br/>remarking its beauty during our short interview, but I am afraid<br/>that I must remain firm upon this point, and I only hope that the<br/>increased salary may recompense you for the loss. Your duties, as<br/>far as the child is concerned, are very light. Now do try to come,<br/>and I shall meet you with the dog-cart at Winchester. Let me know<br/>your train. Yours faithfully, JEPHRO RUCASTLE.'<br/><br/>"That is the letter which I have just received, Mr. Holmes, and<br/>my mind is made up that I will accept it. I thought, however, that<br/>before taking the final step I should like to submit the whole<br/>matter to your consideration."<br/><br/>
