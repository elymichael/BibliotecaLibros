Lord St. Simon had by no means relaxed his rigid attitude, but<br/>had listened with a frowning brow and a compressed lip to this long<br/>narrative.<br/><br/>"Excuse me," he said, "but it is not my custom to discuss my<br/>most intimate personal affairs in this public manner."<br/><br/>"Then you won't forgive me? You won't shake hands before I<br/>go?"<br/><br/>"Oh, certainly, if it would give you any pleasure." He put out<br/>his hand and coldly grasped that which she extended to him.<br/><br/>"I had hoped," suggested Holmes, "that you would have joined us<br/>in a friendly supper."<br/><br/>"I think that there you ask a little too much," responded his<br/>Lordship. "I may be forced to acquiesce in these recent<br/>developments, but I can hardly be expected to make merry over them.<br/>I think that with your permission I will now wish you all a very<br/>good-night." He included us all in a sweeping bow and stalked out<br/>of the room.<br/><br/>"Then I trust that you at least will honour me with your<br/>company," said Sherlock Holmes. "It is always a joy to meet an<br/>American, Mr. Moulton, for I am one of those who believe that the<br/>folly of a monarch and the blundering of a minister in far-gone<br/>years will not prevent our children from being some day citizens of<br/>the same world-wide country under a flag which shall be a<br/>quartering of the Union Jack with the Stars and Stripes."<br/><br/>"The case has been an interesting one," remarked Holmes when our<br/>visitors had left us, "because it serves to show very clearly how<br/>simple the explanation may be of an affair which at first sight<br/>seems to be almost inexplicable. Nothing could be more natural than<br/>the sequence of events as narrated by this lady, and nothing<br/>stranger than the result when viewed, for instance, by Mr. Lestrade<br/>of Scotland Yard."<br/><br/>"You were not yourself at fault at all, then?"<br/><br/>"From the first, two facts were very obvious to me, the one that<br/>the lady had been quite willing to undergo the wedding ceremony,<br/>the other that she had repented of it within a few minutes of<br/>returning home. Obviously something had occurred during the<br/>morning, then, to cause her to change her mind. What could that<br/>something be? She could not have spoken to anyone when she was out,<br/>for she had been in the company of the bridegroom. Had she seen<br/>someone, then? If she had, it must be someone from America because<br/>she had spent so short a time in this country that she could hardly<br/>have allowed anyone to acquire so deep an influence over her that<br/>the mere sight of him would induce her to change her plans so<br/>completely. You see we have already arrived, by a process of<br/>exclusion, at the idea that she might have seen an American. Then<br/>who could this American be, and why should he possess so much<br/>influence over her? It might be a lover; it might be a husband. Her<br/>young womanhood had, I knew, been spent in rough scenes and under<br/>strange conditions. So far I had got before I ever heard Lord St.<br/>Simon's narrative. When he told us of a man in a pew, of the change<br/>in the bride's manner, of so transparent a device for obtaining a<br/>note as the dropping of a bouquet, of her resort to her<br/>confidential maid, and of her very significant allusion to<br/>claim-jumping—which in miners' parlance means taking possession of<br/>that which another person has a prior claim to—the whole situation<br/>became absolutely clear. She had gone off with a man, and the man<br/>was either a lover or was a previous husband—the chances being in<br/>favour of the latter."<br/><br/>"And how in the world did you find them?"<br/>
