<br/>"Awake, Watson?" he asked.<br/><br/>"Yes."<br/><br/>"Game for a morning drive?"<br/><br/>"Certainly."<br/><br/>"Then dress. No one is stirring yet, but I know where the<br/>stable-boy sleeps, and we shall soon have the trap out." He<br/>chuckled to himself as he spoke, his eyes twinkled, and he seemed a<br/>different man to the sombre thinker of the previous night.<br/><br/>As I dressed I glanced at my watch. It was no wonder that no one<br/>was stirring. It was twenty-five minutes past four. I had hardly<br/>finished when Holmes returned with the news that the boy was<br/>putting in the horse.<br/><br/>"I want to test a little theory of mine," said he, pulling on<br/>his boots. "I think, Watson, that you are now standing in the<br/>presence of one of the most absolute fools in Europe. I deserve to<br/>be kicked from here to Charing Cross. But I think I have the key of<br/>the affair now."<br/><br/>"And where is it?" I asked, smiling.<br/><br/>"In the bathroom," he answered. "Oh, yes, I am not joking," he<br/>continued, seeing my look of incredulity. "I have just been there,<br/>and I have taken it out, and I have got it in this Gladstone bag.<br/>Come on, my boy, and we shall see whether it will not fit the<br/>lock."<br/><br/>We made our way downstairs as quietly as possible, and out into<br/>the bright morning sunshine. In the road stood our horse and trap,<br/>with the half-clad stable-boy waiting at the head. We both sprang<br/>in, and away we dashed down the London Road. A few country carts<br/>were stirring, bearing in vegetables to the metropolis, but the<br/>lines of villas on either side were as silent and lifeless as some<br/>city in a dream.<br/><br/>
