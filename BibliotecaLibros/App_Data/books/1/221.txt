Lord St. Simon had by no means relaxed his rigid attitude, but
had listened with a frowning brow and a compressed lip to this long
narrative.

"Excuse me," he said, "but it is not my custom to discuss my
most intimate personal affairs in this public manner."

"Then you won't forgive me? You won't shake hands before I
go?"

"Oh, certainly, if it would give you any pleasure." He put out
his hand and coldly grasped that which she extended to him.

"I had hoped," suggested Holmes, "that you would have joined us
in a friendly supper."

"I think that there you ask a little too much," responded his
Lordship. "I may be forced to acquiesce in these recent
developments, but I can hardly be expected to make merry over them.
I think that with your permission I will now wish you all a very
good-night." He included us all in a sweeping bow and stalked out
of the room.

"Then I trust that you at least will honour me with your
company," said Sherlock Holmes. "It is always a joy to meet an
American, Mr. Moulton, for I am one of those who believe that the
folly of a monarch and the blundering of a minister in far-gone
years will not prevent our children from being some day citizens of
the same world-wide country under a flag which shall be a
quartering of the Union Jack with the Stars and Stripes."

"The case has been an interesting one," remarked Holmes when our
visitors had left us, "because it serves to show very clearly how
simple the explanation may be of an affair which at first sight
seems to be almost inexplicable. Nothing could be more natural than
the sequence of events as narrated by this lady, and nothing
stranger than the result when viewed, for instance, by Mr. Lestrade
of Scotland Yard."

"You were not yourself at fault at all, then?"

"From the first, two facts were very obvious to me, the one that
the lady had been quite willing to undergo the wedding ceremony,
the other that she had repented of it within a few minutes of
returning home. Obviously something had occurred during the
morning, then, to cause her to change her mind. What could that
something be? She could not have spoken to anyone when she was out,
for she had been in the company of the bridegroom. Had she seen
someone, then? If she had, it must be someone from America because
she had spent so short a time in this country that she could hardly
have allowed anyone to acquire so deep an influence over her that
the mere sight of him would induce her to change her plans so
completely. You see we have already arrived, by a process of
exclusion, at the idea that she might have seen an American. Then
who could this American be, and why should he possess so much
influence over her? It might be a lover; it might be a husband. Her
young womanhood had, I knew, been spent in rough scenes and under
strange conditions. So far I had got before I ever heard Lord St.
Simon's narrative. When he told us of a man in a pew, of the change
in the bride's manner, of so transparent a device for obtaining a
note as the dropping of a bouquet, of her resort to her
confidential maid, and of her very significant allusion to
claim-jumping—which in miners' parlance means taking possession of
that which another person has a prior claim to—the whole situation
became absolutely clear. She had gone off with a man, and the man
was either a lover or was a previous husband—the chances being in
favour of the latter."

"And how in the world did you find them?"
