"Then you may entirely rely on me."<br/><br/>"That is excellent. I think, perhaps, it is almost time that I<br/>prepare for the new role I have to play."<br/><br/>He disappeared into his bedroom and returned in a few minutes in<br/>the character of an amiable and simple-minded Nonconformist<br/>clergyman. His broad black hat, his baggy trousers, his white tie,<br/>his sympathetic smile, and general look of peering and benevolent<br/>curiosity were such as Mr. John Hare alone could have equalled. It<br/>was not merely that Holmes changed his costume. His expression, his<br/>manner, his very soul seemed to vary with every fresh part that he<br/>assumed. The stage lost a fine actor, even as science lost an acute<br/>reasoner, when he became a specialist in crime.<br/><br/>It was a quarter past six when we left Baker Street, and it<br/>still wanted ten minutes to the hour when we found ourselves in<br/>Serpentine Avenue. It was already dusk, and the lamps were just<br/>being lighted as we paced up and down in front of Briony Lodge,<br/>waiting for the coming of its occupant. The house was just such as<br/>I had pictured it from Sherlock Holmes' succinct description, but<br/>the locality appeared to be less private than I expected. On the<br/>contrary, for a small street in a quiet neighbourhood, it was<br/>remarkably animated. There was a group of shabbily dressed men<br/>smoking and laughing in a corner, a scissors-grinder with his<br/>wheel, two guardsmen who were flirting with a nurse-girl, and<br/>several well-dressed young men who were lounging up and down with<br/>cigars in their mouths.<br/><br/>"You see," remarked Holmes, as we paced to and fro in front of<br/>the house, "this marriage rather simplifies matters. The photograph<br/>becomes a double-edged weapon now. The chances are that she would<br/>be as averse to its being seen by Mr. Godfrey Norton, as our client<br/>is to its coming to the eyes of his princess. Now the question is,<br/>Where are we to find the photograph?"<br/><br/>"Where, indeed?"<br/><br/>"It is most unlikely that she carries it about with her. It is<br/>cabinet size. Too large for easy concealment about a woman's dress.<br/>She knows that the King is capable of having her waylaid and<br/>searched. Two attempts of the sort have already been made. We may<br/>take it, then, that she does not carry it about with her."<br/><br/>"Where, then?"<br/><br/>"Her banker or her lawyer. There is that double possibility. But<br/>I am inclined to think neither. Women are naturally secretive, and<br/>they like to do their own secreting. Why should she hand it over to<br/>anyone else? She could trust her own guardianship, but she could<br/>not tell what indirect or political influence might be brought to<br/>bear upon a business man. Besides, remember that she had resolved<br/>to use it within a few days. It must be where she can lay her hands<br/>upon it. It must be in her own house."<br/><br/>"But it has twice been burgled."<br/><br/>"Pshaw! They did not know how to look."<br/>
