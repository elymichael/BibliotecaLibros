"And it is—"<br/><br/>"That Miss Flora Millar, the lady who had caused the<br/>disturbance, has actually been arrested. It appears that she was<br/>formerly a danseuse at the Allegro, and that she has known the<br/>bridegroom for some years. There are no further particulars, and<br/>the whole case is in your hands now—so far as it has been set forth<br/>in the public press."<br/><br/>"And an exceedingly interesting case it appears to be. I would<br/>not have missed it for worlds. But there is a ring at the bell,<br/>Watson, and as the clock makes it a few minutes after four, I have<br/>no doubt that this will prove to be our noble client. Do not dream<br/>of going, Watson, for I very much prefer having a witness, if only<br/>as a check to my own memory."<br/><br/>"Lord Robert St. Simon," announced our page-boy, throwing open<br/>the door. A gentleman entered, with a pleasant, cultured face,<br/>high-nosed and pale, with something perhaps of petulance about the<br/>mouth, and with the steady, well-opened eye of a man whose pleasant<br/>lot it had ever been to command and to be obeyed. His manner was<br/>brisk, and yet his general appearance gave an undue impression of<br/>age, for he had a slight forward stoop and a little bend of the<br/>knees as he walked. His hair, too, as he swept off his very<br/>curly-brimmed hat, was grizzled round the edges and thin upon the<br/>top. As to his dress, it was careful to the verge of foppishness,<br/>with high collar, black frock-coat, white waistcoat, yellow gloves,<br/>patent-leather shoes, and light-coloured gaiters. He advanced<br/>slowly into the room, turning his head from left to right, and<br/>swinging in his right hand the cord which held his golden<br/>eyeglasses.<br/><br/>"Good-day, Lord St. Simon," said Holmes, rising and bowing.<br/>"Pray take the basket-chair. This is my friend and colleague, Dr.<br/>Watson. Draw up a little to the fire, and we will talk this matter<br/>over."<br/><br/>"A most painful matter to me, as you can most readily imagine,<br/>Mr. Holmes. I have been cut to the quick. I understand that you<br/>have already managed several delicate cases of this sort, sir,<br/>though I presume that they were hardly from the same class of<br/>society."<br/><br/>"No, I am descending."<br/><br/>"I beg pardon."<br/><br/>"My last client of the sort was a king."<br/><br/>"Oh, really! I had no idea. And which king?"<br/><br/>"The King of Scandinavia."<br/>
