"Will you come with me?" asked Holmes, glancing up.<br/><br/>"I should wish to."<br/><br/>"Just look it up, then."<br/><br/>"There is a train at half-past nine," said I, glancing over my<br/>Bradshaw. "It is due at Winchester at 11:30."<br/><br/>"That will do very nicely. Then perhaps I had better postpone my<br/>analysis of the acetones, as we may need to be at our best in the<br/>morning."<br/><br/>By eleven o'clock the next day we were well upon our way to the<br/>old English capital. Holmes had been buried in the morning papers<br/>all the way down, but after we had passed the Hampshire border he<br/>threw them down and began to admire the scenery. It was an ideal<br/>spring day, a light blue sky, flecked with little fleecy white<br/>clouds drifting across from west to east. The sun was shining very<br/>brightly, and yet there was an exhilarating nip in the air, which<br/>set an edge to a man's energy. All over the countryside, away to<br/>the rolling hills around Aldershot, the little red and grey roofs<br/>of the farm-steadings peeped out from amid the light green of the<br/>new foliage.<br/><br/>"Are they not fresh and beautiful?" I cried with all the<br/>enthusiasm of a man fresh from the fogs of Baker Street.<br/><br/>But Holmes shook his head gravely.<br/><br/>"Do you know, Watson," said he, "that it is one of the curses of<br/>a mind with a turn like mine that I must look at everything with<br/>reference to my own special subject. You look at these scattered<br/>houses, and you are impressed by their beauty. I look at them, and<br/>the only thought which comes to me is a feeling of their isolation<br/>and of the impunity with which crime may be committed there."<br/><br/>"Good heavens!" I cried. "Who would associate crime with these<br/>dear old homesteads?"<br/><br/>"They always fill me with a certain horror. It is my belief,<br/>Watson, founded upon my experience, that the lowest and vilest<br/>alleys in London do not present a more dreadful record of sin than<br/>does the smiling and beautiful countryside."<br/>
