<br/>Holmes rose and sat down at the table with his pen in his hand<br/>and a bundle of paper before him. "Just tell us the truth," he<br/>said. "I shall jot down the facts. You will sign it, and Watson<br/>here can witness it. Then I could produce your confession at the<br/>last extremity to save young McCarthy. I promise you that I shall<br/>not use it unless it is absolutely needed."<br/><br/>"It's as well," said the old man; "it's a question whether I<br/>shall live to the Assizes, so it matters little to me, but I should<br/>wish to spare Alice the shock. And now I will make the thing clear<br/>to you; it has been a long time in the acting, but will not take me<br/>long to tell.<br/><br/>"You didn't know this dead man, McCarthy. He was a devil<br/>incarnate. I tell you that. God keep you out of the clutches of<br/>such a man as he. His grip has been upon me these twenty years, and<br/>he has blasted my life. I'll tell you first how I came to be in his<br/>power.<br/><br/>"It was in the early '60's at the diggings. I was a young chap<br/>then, hot-blooded and reckless, ready to turn my hand at anything;<br/>I got among bad companions, took to drink, had no luck with my<br/>claim, took to the bush, and in a word became what you would call<br/>over here a highway robber. There were six of us, and we had a<br/>wild, free life of it, sticking up a station from time to time, or<br/>stopping the wagons on the road to the diggings. Black Jack of<br/>Ballarat was the name I went under, and our party is still<br/>remembered in the colony as the Ballarat Gang.<br/><br/>"One day a gold convoy came down from Ballarat to Melbourne, and<br/>we lay in wait for it and attacked it. There were six troopers and<br/>six of us, so it was a close thing, but we emptied four of their<br/>saddles at the first volley. Three of our boys were killed,<br/>however, before we got the swag. I put my pistol to the head of the<br/>wagon-driver, who was this very man McCarthy. I wish to the Lord<br/>that I had shot him then, but I spared him, though I saw his wicked<br/>little eyes fixed on my face, as though to remember every feature.<br/>We got away with the gold, became wealthy men, and made our way<br/>over to England without being suspected. There I parted from my old<br/>pals and determined to settle down to a quiet and respectable life.<br/>I bought this estate, which chanced to be in the market, and I set<br/>myself to do a little good with my money, to make up for the way in<br/>which I had earned it. I married, too, and though my wife died<br/>young she left me my dear little Alice. Even when she was just a<br/>baby her wee hand seemed to lead me down the right path as nothing<br/>else had ever done. In a word, I turned over a new leaf and did my<br/>best to make up for the past. All was going well when McCarthy laid<br/>his grip upon me.<br/><br/>"I had gone up to town about an investment, and I met him in<br/>Regent Street with hardly a coat to his back or a boot to his<br/>foot.<br/><br/>"'Here we are, Jack,' says he, touching me on the arm; 'we'll be<br/>as good as a family to you. There's two of us, me and my son, and<br/>you can have the keeping of us. If you don'tâ€”it's a fine,<br/>law-abiding country is England, and there's always a policeman<br/>within hail.'<br/><br/>"Well, down they came to the west country, there was no shaking<br/>them off, and there they have lived rent free on my best land ever<br/>since. There was no rest for me, no peace, no forgetfulness; turn<br/>where I would, there was his cunning, grinning face at my elbow. It<br/>grew worse as Alice grew up, for he soon saw I was more afraid of<br/>her knowing my past than of the police. Whatever he wanted he must<br/>have, and whatever it was I gave him without question, land, money,<br/>houses, until at last he asked a thing which I could not give. He<br/>asked for Alice.<br/><br/>"His son, you see, had grown up, and so had my girl, and as I<br/>was known to be in weak health, it seemed a fine stroke to him that<br/>his lad should step into the whole property. But there I was firm.<br/>I would not have his cursed stock mixed with mine; not that I had<br/>any dislike to the lad, but his blood was in him, and that was<br/>enough. I stood firm. McCarthy threatened. I braved him to do his<br/>worst. We were to meet at the pool midway between our houses to<br/>talk it over.<br/><br/>"When I went down there I found him talking with his son, so I<br/>smoked a cigar and waited behind a tree until he should be alone.<br/>But as I listened to his talk all that was black and bitter in me<br/>seemed to come uppermost. He was urging his son to marry my<br/>daughter with as little regard for what she might think as if she<br/>were a slut from off the streets. It drove me mad to think that I<br/>and all that I held most dear should be in the power of such a man<br/>as this. Could I not snap the bond? I was already a dying and a<br/>desperate man. Though clear of mind and fairly strong of limb, I<br/>knew that my own fate was sealed. But my memory and my girl! Both<br/>could be saved if I could but silence that foul tongue. I did it,<br/>Mr. Holmes. I would do it again. Deeply as I have sinned, I have<br/>led a life of martyrdom to atone for it. But that my girl should be<br/>entangled in the same meshes which held me was more than I could<br/>suffer. I struck him down with no more compunction than if he had<br/>been some foul and venomous beast. His cry brought back his son;<br/>but I had gained the cover of the wood, though I was forced to go<br/>back to fetch the cloak which I had dropped in my flight. That is<br/>the true story, gentlemen, of all that occurred."<br/><br/>
