"Better close the front door," cried Holmes, and we all rushed<br/>down the stairs together. We had hardly reached the hall when we<br/>heard the baying of a hound, and then a scream of agony, with a<br/>horrible worrying sound which it was dreadful to listen to. An<br/>elderly man with a red face and shaking limbs came staggering out<br/>at a side door.<br/><br/>"My God!" he cried. "Someone has loosed the dog. It's not been<br/>fed for two days. Quick, quick, or it'll be too late!"<br/><br/>Holmes and I rushed out and round the angle of the house, with<br/>Toller hurrying behind us. There was the huge famished brute, its<br/>black muzzle buried in Rucastle's throat, while he writhed and<br/>screamed upon the ground. Running up, I blew its brains out, and it<br/>fell over with its keen white teeth still meeting in the great<br/>creases of his neck. With much labour we separated them and carried<br/>him, living but horribly mangled, into the house. We laid him upon<br/>the drawing-room sofa, and having dispatched the sobered Toller to<br/>bear the news to his wife, I did what I could to relieve his pain.<br/>We were all assembled round him when the door opened, and a tall,<br/>gaunt woman entered the room.<br/><br/>"Mrs. Toller!" cried Miss Hunter.<br/><br/>"Yes, miss. Mr. Rucastle let me out when he came back before he<br/>went up to you. Ah, miss, it is a pity you didn't let me know what<br/>you were planning, for I would have told you that your pains were<br/>wasted."<br/><br/>"Ha!" said Holmes, looking keenly at her. "It is clear that Mrs.<br/>Toller knows more about this matter than anyone else."<br/><br/>"Yes, sir, I do, and I am ready enough to tell what I know."<br/><br/>"Then, pray, sit down, and let us hear it for there are several<br/>points on which I must confess that I am still in the dark."<br/><br/>"I will soon make it clear to you," said she; "and I'd have done<br/>so before now if I could ha' got out from the cellar. If there's<br/>police-court business over this, you'll remember that I was the one<br/>that stood your friend, and that I was Miss Alice's friend too.<br/><br/>"She was never happy at home, Miss Alice wasn't, from the time<br/>that her father married again. She was slighted like and had no say<br/>in anything, but it never really became bad for her until after she<br/>met Mr. Fowler at a friend's house. As well as I could learn, Miss<br/>Alice had rights of her own by will, but she was so quiet and<br/>patient, she was, that she never said a word about them but just<br/>left everything in Mr. Rucastle's hands. He knew he was safe with<br/>her; but when there was a chance of a husband coming forward, who<br/>would ask for all that the law would give him, then her father<br/>thought it time to put a stop on it. He wanted her to sign a paper,<br/>so that whether she married or not, he could use her money. When<br/>she wouldn't do it, he kept on worrying her until she got<br/>brain-fever, and for six weeks was at death's door. Then she got<br/>better at last, all worn to a shadow, and with her beautiful hair<br/>cut off; but that didn't make no change in her young man, and he<br/>stuck to her as true as man could be."<br/><br/>"Ah," said Holmes, "I think that what you have been good enough<br/>to tell us makes the matter fairly clear, and that I can deduce all<br/>that remains. Mr. Rucastle then, I presume, took to this system of<br/>imprisonment?"<br/>
