<br/>"Never mind him. I may want your help, and so may he. Here he<br/>comes. Sit down in that armchair, Doctor, and give us your best<br/>attention."<br/><br/>A slow and heavy step, which had been heard upon the stairs and<br/>in the passage, paused immediately outside the door. Then there was<br/>a loud and authoritative tap.<br/><br/>"Come in!" said Holmes.<br/><br/>A man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six<br/>inches in height, with the chest and limbs of a Hercules. His dress<br/>was rich with a richness which would, in England, be looked upon as<br/>akin to bad taste. Heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed across the<br/>sleeves and fronts of his double-breasted coat, while the deep blue<br/>cloak which was thrown over his shoulders was lined with<br/>flame-coloured silk and secured at the neck with a brooch which<br/>consisted of a single flaming beryl. Boots which extended halfway<br/>up his calves, and which were trimmed at the tops with rich brown<br/>fur, completed the impression of barbaric opulence which was<br/>suggested by his whole appearance. He carried a broad-brimmed hat<br/>in his hand, while he wore across the upper part of his face,<br/>extending down past the cheekbones, a black vizard mask, which he<br/>had apparently adjusted that very moment, for his hand was still<br/>raised to it as he entered. From the lower part of the face he<br/>appeared to be a man of strong character, with a thick, hanging<br/>lip, and a long, straight chin suggestive of resolution pushed to<br/>the length of obstinacy.<br/><br/>"You had my note?" he asked with a deep harsh voice and a<br/>strongly marked German accent. "I told you that I would call." He<br/>looked from one to the other of us, as if uncertain which to<br/>address.<br/><br/>"Pray take a seat," said Holmes. "This is my friend and<br/>colleague, Dr. Watson, who is occasionally good enough to help me<br/>in my cases. Whom have I the honour to address?"<br/><br/>"You may address me as the Count Von Kramm, a Bohemian nobleman.<br/>I understand that this gentleman, your friend, is a man of honour<br/>and discretion, whom I may trust with a matter of the most extreme<br/>importance. If not, I should much prefer to communicate with you<br/>alone."<br/><br/>I rose to go, but Holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed me<br/>back into my chair. "It is both, or none," said he. "You may say<br/>before this gentleman anything which you may say to me."<br/><br/>The Count shrugged his broad shoulders. "Then I must begin,"<br/>said he, "by binding you both to absolute secrecy for two years; at<br/>the end of that time the matter will be of no importance. At<br/>present it is not too much to say that it is of such weight it may<br/>have an influence upon European history."<br/><br/>"I promise," said Holmes.<br/><br/>
