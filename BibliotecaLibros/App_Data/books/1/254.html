<br/>"Danger! What danger do you foresee?"<br/><br/>Holmes shook his head gravely. "It would cease to be a danger if<br/>we could define it," said he. "But at any time, day or night, a<br/>telegram would bring me down to your help."<br/><br/>"That is enough." She rose briskly from her chair with the<br/>anxiety all swept from her face. "I shall go down to Hampshire<br/>quite easy in my mind now. I shall write to Mr. Rucastle at once,<br/>sacrifice my poor hair to-night, and start for Winchester<br/>to-morrow." With a few grateful words to Holmes she bade us both<br/>good-night and bustled off upon her way.<br/><br/>"At least," said I as we heard her quick, firm steps descending<br/>the stairs, "she seems to be a young lady who is very well able to<br/>take care of herself."<br/><br/>"And she would need to be," said Holmes gravely. "I am much<br/>mistaken if we do not hear from her before many days are past."<br/><br/>It was not very long before my friend's prediction was<br/>fulfilled. A fortnight went by, during which I frequently found my<br/>thoughts turning in her direction and wondering what strange<br/>side-alley of human experience this lonely woman had strayed into.<br/>The unusual salary, the curious conditions, the light duties, all<br/>pointed to something abnormal, though whether a fad or a plot, or<br/>whether the man were a philanthropist or a villain, it was quite<br/>beyond my powers to determine. As to Holmes, I observed that he sat<br/>frequently for half an hour on end, with knitted brows and an<br/>abstracted air, but he swept the matter away with a wave of his<br/>hand when I mentioned it. "Data! data! data!" he cried impatiently.<br/>"I can't make bricks without clay." And yet he would always wind up<br/>by muttering that no sister of his should ever have accepted such a<br/>situation.<br/><br/>The telegram which we eventually received came late one night<br/>just as I was thinking of turning in and Holmes was settling down<br/>to one of those all-night chemical researches which he frequently<br/>indulged in, when I would leave him stooping over a retort and a<br/>test-tube at night and find him in the same position when I came<br/>down to breakfast in the morning. He opened the yellow envelope,<br/>and then, glancing at the message, threw it across to me.<br/><br/>"Just look up the trains in Bradshaw," said he, and turned back<br/>to his chemical studies.<br/><br/>The summons was a brief and urgent one.<br/><br/>"Please be at the Black Swan Hotel at Winchester at midday<br/>to-morrow," it said. "Do come! I am at my wit's end. HUNTER."<br/><br/>
