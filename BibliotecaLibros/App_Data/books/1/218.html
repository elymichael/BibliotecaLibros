<br/>He had hardly shut the door behind him when Holmes rose to put<br/>on his overcoat. "There is something in what the fellow says about<br/>outdoor work," he remarked, "so I think, Watson, that I must leave<br/>you to your papers for a little."<br/><br/>It was after five o'clock when Sherlock Holmes left me, but I<br/>had no time to be lonely, for within an hour there arrived a<br/>confectioner's man with a very large flat box. This he unpacked<br/>with the help of a youth whom he had brought with him, and<br/>presently, to my very great astonishment, a quite epicurean little<br/>cold supper began to be laid out upon our humble lodging-house<br/>mahogany. There were a couple of brace of cold woodcock, a<br/>pheasant, a pâté de foie gras pie with a group of ancient and<br/>cobwebby bottles. Having laid out all these luxuries, my two<br/>visitors vanished away, like the genii of the Arabian Nights, with<br/>no explanation save that the things had been paid for and were<br/>ordered to this address.<br/><br/>Just before nine o'clock Sherlock Holmes stepped briskly into<br/>the room. His features were gravely set, but there was a light in<br/>his eye which made me think that he had not been disappointed in<br/>his conclusions.<br/><br/>"They have laid the supper, then," he said, rubbing his<br/>hands.<br/><br/>"You seem to expect company. They have laid for five."<br/><br/>"Yes, I fancy we may have some company dropping in," said he. "I<br/>am surprised that Lord St. Simon has not already arrived. Ha! I<br/>fancy that I hear his step now upon the stairs."<br/><br/>It was indeed our visitor of the afternoon who came bustling in,<br/>dangling his glasses more vigorously than ever, and with a very<br/>perturbed expression upon his aristocratic features.<br/><br/>"My messenger reached you, then?" asked Holmes.<br/><br/>"Yes, and I confess that the contents startled me beyond<br/>measure. Have you good authority for what you say?"<br/><br/>"The best possible."<br/><br/>
