"It is our task to find that out," replied Holmes; "so now, if<br/>you please, Mr. Holder, we will set off for Streatham together, and<br/>devote an hour to glancing a little more closely into details."<br/><br/>My friend insisted upon my accompanying them in their<br/>expedition, which I was eager enough to do, for my curiosity and<br/>sympathy were deeply stirred by the story to which we had listened.<br/>I confess that the guilt of the banker's son appeared to me to be<br/>as obvious as it did to his unhappy father, but still I had such<br/>faith in Holmes' judgment that I felt that there must be some<br/>grounds for hope as long as he was dissatisfied with the accepted<br/>explanation. He hardly spoke a word the whole way out to the<br/>southern suburb, but sat with his chin upon his breast and his hat<br/>drawn over his eyes, sunk in the deepest thought. Our client<br/>appeared to have taken fresh heart at the little glimpse of hope<br/>which had been presented to him, and he even broke into a desultory<br/>chat with me over his business affairs. A short railway journey and<br/>a shorter walk brought us to Fairbank, the modest residence of the<br/>great financier.<br/><br/>Fairbank was a good-sized square house of white stone, standing<br/>back a little from the road. A double carriage-sweep, with a<br/>snow-clad lawn, stretched down in front to two large iron gates<br/>which closed the entrance. On the right side was a small wooden<br/>thicket, which led into a narrow path between two neat hedges<br/>stretching from the road to the kitchen door, and forming the<br/>tradesmen's entrance. On the left ran a lane which led to the<br/>stables, and was not itself within the grounds at all, being a<br/>public, though little used, thoroughfare. Holmes left us standing<br/>at the door and walked slowly all round the house, across the<br/>front, down the tradesmen's path, and so round by the garden behind<br/>into the stable lane. So long was he that Mr. Holder and I went<br/>into the dining-room and waited by the fire until he should return.<br/>We were sitting there in silence when the door opened and a young<br/>lady came in. She was rather above the middle height, slim, with<br/>dark hair and eyes, which seemed the darker against the absolute<br/>pallor of her skin. I do not think that I have ever seen such<br/>deadly paleness in a woman's face. Her lips, too, were bloodless,<br/>but her eyes were flushed with crying. As she swept silently into<br/>the room she impressed me with a greater sense of grief than the<br/>banker had done in the morning, and it was the more striking in her<br/>as she was evidently a woman of strong character, with immense<br/>capacity for self-restraint. Disregarding my presence, she went<br/>straight to her uncle and passed her hand over his head with a<br/>sweet womanly caress.<br/><br/>"You have given orders that Arthur should be liberated, have you<br/>not, dad?" she asked.<br/><br/>"No, no, my girl, the matter must be probed to the bottom."<br/><br/>"But I am so sure that he is innocent. You know what woman's<br/>instincts are. I know that he has done no harm and that you will be<br/>sorry for having acted so harshly."<br/><br/>"Why is he silent, then, if he is innocent?"<br/><br/>"Who knows? Perhaps because he was so angry that you should<br/>suspect him."<br/><br/>"How could I help suspecting him, when I actually saw him with<br/>the coronet in his hand?"<br/><br/>"Oh, but he had only picked it up to look at it. Oh, do, do take<br/>my word for it that he is innocent. Let the matter drop and say no<br/>more. It is so dreadful to think of our dear Arthur in prison!"<br/><br/>"I shall never let it drop until the gems are foundâ€”never, Mary!<br/>Your affection for Arthur blinds you as to the awful consequences<br/>to me. Far from hushing the thing up, I have brought a gentleman<br/>down from London to inquire more deeply into it."<br/>
