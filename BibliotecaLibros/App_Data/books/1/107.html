"Between nine and ten last night Police-Constable Cook, of the H<br/>Division, on duty near Waterloo Bridge, heard a cry for help and a<br/>splash in the water. The night, however, was extremely dark and<br/>stormy, so that, in spite of the help of several passers-by, it was<br/>quite impossible to effect a rescue. The alarm, however, was given,<br/>and, by the aid of the water-police, the body was eventually<br/>recovered. It proved to be that of a young gentleman whose name, as<br/>it appears from an envelope which was found in his pocket, was John<br/>Openshaw, and whose residence is near Horsham. It is conjectured<br/>that he may have been hurrying down to catch the last train from<br/>Waterloo Station, and that in his haste and the extreme darkness he<br/>missed his path and walked over the edge of one of the small<br/>landing-places for river steamboats. The body exhibited no traces<br/>of violence, and there can be no doubt that the deceased had been<br/>the victim of an unfortunate accident, which should have the effect<br/>of calling the attention of the authorities to the condition of the<br/>riverside landing-stages."<br/><br/>We sat in silence for some minutes, Holmes more depressed and<br/>shaken than I had ever seen him.<br/><br/>"That hurts my pride, Watson," he said at last. "It is a petty<br/>feeling, no doubt, but it hurts my pride. It becomes a personal<br/>matter with me now, and, if God sends me health, I shall set my<br/>hand upon this gang. That he should come to me for help, and that I<br/>should send him away to his deathâ€”!" He sprang from his chair and<br/>paced about the room in uncontrollable agitation, with a flush upon<br/>his sallow cheeks and a nervous clasping and unclasping of his long<br/>thin hands.<br/><br/>"They must be cunning devils," he exclaimed at last. "How could<br/>they have decoyed him down there? The Embankment is not on the<br/>direct line to the station. The bridge, no doubt, was too crowded,<br/>even on such a night, for their purpose. Well, Watson, we shall see<br/>who will win in the long run. I am going out now!"<br/><br/>"To the police?"<br/><br/>"No; I shall be my own police. When I have spun the web they may<br/>take the flies, but not before."<br/><br/>All day I was engaged in my professional work, and it was late<br/>in the evening before I returned to Baker Street. Sherlock Holmes<br/>had not come back yet. It was nearly ten o'clock before he entered,<br/>looking pale and worn. He walked up to the sideboard, and tearing a<br/>piece from the loaf he devoured it voraciously, washing it down<br/>with a long draught of water.<br/><br/>"You are hungry," I remarked.<br/><br/>"Starving. It had escaped my memory. I have had nothing since<br/>breakfast."<br/><br/>"Nothing?"<br/><br/>"Not a bite. I had no time to think of it."<br/>
