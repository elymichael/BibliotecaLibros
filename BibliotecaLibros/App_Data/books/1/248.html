<br/>"DEAR MR. HOLMES:â€”I am very anxious to consult you as to whether<br/>I should or should not accept a situation which has been offered to<br/>me as governess. I shall call at half-past ten to-morrow if I do<br/>not inconvenience you. Yours faithfully, "VIOLET HUNTER."<br/><br/>"Do you know the young lady?" I asked.<br/><br/>"Not I."<br/><br/>"It is half-past ten now."<br/><br/>"Yes, and I have no doubt that is her ring."<br/><br/>"It may turn out to be of more interest than you think. You<br/>remember that the affair of the blue carbuncle, which appeared to<br/>be a mere whim at first, developed into a serious investigation. It<br/>may be so in this case, also."<br/><br/>"Well, let us hope so. But our doubts will very soon be solved,<br/>for here, unless I am much mistaken, is the person in<br/>question."<br/><br/>As he spoke the door opened and a young lady entered the room.<br/>She was plainly but neatly dressed, with a bright, quick face,<br/>freckled like a plover's egg, and with the brisk manner of a woman<br/>who has had her own way to make in the world.<br/><br/>"You will excuse my troubling you, I am sure," said she, as my<br/>companion rose to greet her, "but I have had a very strange<br/>experience, and as I have no parents or relations of any sort from<br/>whom I could ask advice, I thought that perhaps you would be kind<br/>enough to tell me what I should do."<br/><br/>"Pray take a seat, Miss Hunter. I shall be happy to do anything<br/>that I can to serve you."<br/><br/>
