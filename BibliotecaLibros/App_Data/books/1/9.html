I did so, and saw a large "E" with a small "g," a "P," and a<br/>large "G" with a small "t" woven into the texture of the paper.<br/><br/>"What do you make of that?" asked Holmes.<br/><br/>"The name of the maker, no doubt; or his monogram, rather."<br/><br/>"Not at all. The 'G' with the small 't' stands for<br/>'Gesellschaft,' which is the German for 'Company.' It is a<br/>customary contraction like our 'Co.' 'P,' of course, stands for<br/>'Papier.' Now for the 'Eg.' Let us glance at our Continental<br/>Gazetteer." He took down a heavy brown volume from his shelves.<br/>"Eglow, Eglonitz—here we are, Egria. It is in a German-speaking<br/>country—in Bohemia, not far from Carlsbad. 'Remarkable as being the<br/>scene of the death of Wallenstein, and for its numerous<br/>glass-factories and paper-mills.' Ha, ha, my boy, what do you make<br/>of that?"

And here he comes, if I am not mistaken,<br/>to resolve all our doubts."<br/><br/>As he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses' hoofs and<br/>grating wheels against the curb, followed by a sharp pull at the<br/>bell. Holmes whistled.<br/><br/>"A pair, by the sound," said he. "Yes," he continued, glancing<br/>out of the window. "A nice little brougham and a pair of beauties.<br/>A hundred and fifty guineas apiece. There's money in this case,<br/>Watson, if there is nothing else."<br/><br/>"I think that I had better go, Holmes."<br/><br/>"Not a bit, Doctor. Stay where you are. I am lost without my<br/>Boswell. And this promises to be interesting. It would be a pity to<br/>miss it."<br/><br/>"But your client—"<br/>
