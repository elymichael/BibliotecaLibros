<br/>"'Yes, we could easily give you a shake-down.'<br/><br/>"'That is very awkward. Could I not come at some more convenient<br/>hour?'<br/><br/>"'We have judged it best that you should come late. It is to<br/>recompense you for any inconvenience that we are paying to you, a<br/>young and unknown man, a fee which would buy an opinion from the<br/>very heads of your profession. Still, of course, if you would like<br/>to draw out of the business, there is plenty of time to do so.'<br/><br/>"I thought of the fifty guineas, and of how very useful they<br/>would be to me. 'Not at all,' said I, 'I shall be very happy to<br/>accommodate myself to your wishes. I should like, however, to<br/>understand a little more clearly what it is that you wish me to<br/>do.'<br/><br/>"'Quite so. It is very natural that the pledge of secrecy which<br/>we have exacted from you should have aroused your curiosity. I have<br/>no wish to commit you to anything without your having it all laid<br/>before you. I suppose that we are absolutely safe from<br/>eavesdroppers?'<br/><br/>"'Entirely.'<br/><br/>"'Then the matter stands thus. You are probably aware that<br/>fuller's-earth is a valuable product, and that it is only found in<br/>one or two places in England?'<br/><br/>"'I have heard so.'<br/><br/>"'Some little time ago I bought a small place—a very small<br/>place—within ten miles of Reading. I was fortunate enough to<br/>discover that there was a deposit of fuller's-earth in one of my<br/>fields. On examining it, however, I found that this deposit was a<br/>comparatively small one, and that it formed a link between two very<br/>much larger ones upon the right and left—both of them, however, in<br/>the grounds of my neighbours. These good people were absolutely<br/>ignorant that their land contained that which was quite as valuable<br/>as a gold-mine. Naturally, it was to my interest to buy their land<br/>before they discovered its true value, but unfortunately I had no<br/>capital by which I could do this. I took a few of my friends into<br/>the secret, however, and they suggested that we should quietly and<br/>secretly work our own little deposit and that in this way we should<br/>earn the money which would enable us to buy the neighbouring<br/>fields. This we have now been doing for some time, and in order to<br/>help us in our operations we erected a hydraulic press. This press,<br/>as I have already explained, has got out of order, and we wish your<br/>advice upon the subject. We guard our secret very jealously,<br/>however, and if it once became known that we had hydraulic<br/>engineers coming to our little house, it would soon rouse inquiry,<br/>and then, if the facts came out, it would be good-bye to any chance<br/>of getting these fields and carrying out our plans. That is why I<br/>have made you promise me that you will not tell a human being that<br/>you are going to Eyford to-night. I hope that I make it all<br/>plain?'<br/><br/>"'I quite follow you,' said I. 'The only point which I could not<br/>quite understand was what use you could make of a hydraulic press<br/>in excavating fuller's-earth, which, as I understand, is dug out<br/>like gravel from a pit.'<br/><br/>
