"It certainly sounds feasible."

"Well, we will take it as a working hypothesis for want of a
better. Boone, as I have told you, was arrested and taken to the
station, but it could not be shown that there had ever before been
anything against him. He had for years been known as a professional
beggar, but his life appeared to have been a very quiet and
innocent one. There the matter stands at present, and the questions
which have to be solved—what Neville St. Clair was doing in the
opium den, what happened to him when there, where is he now, and
what Hugh Boone had to do with his disappearance—are all as far
from a solution as ever. I confess that I cannot recall any case
within my experience which looked at the first glance so simple and
yet which presented such difficulties."

While Sherlock Holmes had been detailing this singular series of
events, we had been whirling through the outskirts of the great
town until the last straggling houses had been left behind, and we
rattled along with a country hedge upon either side of us. Just as
he finished, however, we drove through two scattered villages,
where a few lights still glimmered in the windows.

"We are on the outskirts of Lee," said my companion. "We have
touched on three English counties in our short drive, starting in
Middlesex, passing over an angle of Surrey, and ending in Kent. See
that light among the trees? That is The Cedars, and beside that
lamp sits a woman whose anxious ears have already, I have little
doubt, caught the clink of our horse's feet."

"But why are you not conducting the case from Baker Street?" I
asked.

"Because there are many inquiries which must be made out here.
Mrs. St. Clair has most kindly put two rooms at my disposal, and
you may rest assured that she will have nothing but a welcome for
my friend and colleague. I hate to meet her, Watson, when I have no
news of her husband. Here we are. Whoa, there, whoa!"

We had pulled up in front of a large villa which stood within
its own grounds. A stable-boy had run out to the horse's head, and
springing down, I followed Holmes up the small, winding
gravel-drive which led to the house. As we approached, the door
flew open, and a little blonde woman stood in the opening, clad in
some sort of light mousseline de soie, with a touch of fluffy pink
chiffon at her neck and wrists. She stood with her figure outlined
against the flood of light, one hand upon the door, one half-raised
in her eagerness, her body slightly bent, her head and face
protruded, with eager eyes and parted lips, a standing
question.

"Well?" she cried, "well?" And then, seeing that there were two
of us, she gave a cry of hope which sank into a groan as she saw
that my companion shook his head and shrugged his shoulders.

"No good news?"

"None."
