<br/>"But how will you look?"<br/><br/>"I will not look."<br/><br/>"What then?"<br/><br/>"I will get her to show me."<br/><br/>"But she will refuse."<br/><br/>"She will not be able to. But I hear the rumble of wheels. It is<br/>her carriage. Now carry out my orders to the letter."<br/><br/>As he spoke the gleam of the side-lights of a carriage came<br/>round the curve of the avenue. It was a smart little landau which<br/>rattled up to the door of Briony Lodge. As it pulled up, one of the<br/>loafing men at the corner dashed forward to open the door in the<br/>hope of earning a copper, but was elbowed away by another loafer,<br/>who had rushed up with the same intention. A fierce quarrel broke<br/>out, which was increased by the two guardsmen, who took sides with<br/>one of the loungers, and by the scissors-grinder, who was equally<br/>hot upon the other side. A blow was struck, and in an instant the<br/>lady, who had stepped from her carriage, was the centre of a little<br/>knot of flushed and struggling men, who struck savagely at each<br/>other with their fists and sticks. Holmes dashed into the crowd to<br/>protect the lady; but just as he reached her he gave a cry and<br/>dropped to the ground, with the blood running freely down his face.<br/>At his fall the guardsmen took to their heels in one direction and<br/>the loungers in the other, while a number of better-dressed people,<br/>who had watched the scuffle without taking part in it, crowded in<br/>to help the lady and to attend to the injured man. Irene Adler, as<br/>I will still call her, had hurried up the steps; but she stood at<br/>the top with her superb figure outlined against the lights of the<br/>hall, looking back into the street.<br/><br/>"Is the poor gentleman much hurt?" she asked.<br/><br/>"He is dead," cried several voices.<br/><br/>"No, no, there's life in him!" shouted another. "But he'll be<br/>gone before you can get him to hospital."<br/><br/>
