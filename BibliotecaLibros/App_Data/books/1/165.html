"And what do you think of it all, Watson?" asked Sherlock<br/>Holmes, leaning back in his chair.<br/><br/>"It seems to me to be a most dark and sinister business."<br/><br/>"Dark enough and sinister enough."<br/><br/>"Yet if the lady is correct in saying that the flooring and<br/>walls are sound, and that the door, window, and chimney are<br/>impassable, then her sister must have been undoubtedly alone when<br/>she met her mysterious end."<br/><br/>"What becomes, then, of these nocturnal whistles, and what of<br/>the very peculiar words of the dying woman?"<br/><br/>"I cannot think."<br/><br/>"When you combine the ideas of whistles at night, the presence<br/>of a band of gipsies who are on intimate terms with this old<br/>doctor, the fact that we have every reason to believe that the<br/>doctor has an interest in preventing his stepdaughter's marriage,<br/>the dying allusion to a band, and, finally, the fact that Miss<br/>Helen Stoner heard a metallic clang, which might have been caused<br/>by one of those metal bars that secured the shutters falling back<br/>into its place, I think that there is good ground to think that the<br/>mystery may be cleared along those lines."<br/><br/>"But what, then, did the gipsies do?"<br/><br/>"I cannot imagine."<br/><br/>"I see many objections to any such theory."<br/><br/>"And so do I. It is precisely for that reason that we are going<br/>to Stoke Moran this day. I want to see whether the objections are<br/>fatal, or if they may be explained away. But what in the name of<br/>the devil!"<br/>
