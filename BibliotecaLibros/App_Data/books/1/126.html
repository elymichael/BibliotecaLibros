"He disappeared so suddenly."<br/><br/>"He might have leaped back. You did not see anyone else in the<br/>room?"<br/><br/>"No, but this horrible man confessed to having been there, and<br/>the Lascar was at the foot of the stairs."<br/><br/>"Quite so. Your husband, as far as you could see, had his<br/>ordinary clothes on?"<br/><br/>"But without his collar or tie. I distinctly saw his bare<br/>throat."<br/><br/>"Had he ever spoken of Swandam Lane?"<br/><br/>"Never."<br/><br/>"Had he ever showed any signs of having taken opium?"<br/><br/>"Never."<br/><br/>"Thank you, Mrs. St. Clair. Those are the principal points about<br/>which I wished to be absolutely clear. We shall now have a little<br/>supper and then retire, for we may have a very busy day<br/>to-morrow."<br/><br/>A large and comfortable double-bedded room had been placed at<br/>our disposal, and I was quickly between the sheets, for I was weary<br/>after my night of adventure. Sherlock Holmes was a man, however,<br/>who, when he had an unsolved problem upon his mind, would go for<br/>days, and even for a week, without rest, turning it over,<br/>rearranging his facts, looking at it from every point of view until<br/>he had either fathomed it or convinced himself that his data were<br/>insufficient. It was soon evident to me that he was now preparing<br/>for an all-night sitting. He took off his coat and waistcoat, put<br/>on a large blue dressing-gown, and then wandered about the room<br/>collecting pillows from his bed and cushions from the sofa and<br/>armchairs. With these he constructed a sort of Eastern divan, upon<br/>which he perched himself cross-legged, with an ounce of shag<br/>tobacco and a box of matches laid out in front of him. In the dim<br/>light of the lamp I saw him sitting there, an old briar pipe<br/>between his lips, his eyes fixed vacantly upon the corner of the<br/>ceiling, the blue smoke curling up from him, silent, motionless,<br/>with the light shining upon his strong-set aquiline features. So he<br/>sat as I dropped off to sleep, and so he sat when a sudden<br/>ejaculation caused me to wake up, and I found the summer sun<br/>shining into the apartment. The pipe was still between his lips,<br/>the smoke still curled upward, and the room was full of a dense<br/>tobacco haze, but nothing remained of the heap of shag which I had<br/>seen upon the previous night.<br/>
