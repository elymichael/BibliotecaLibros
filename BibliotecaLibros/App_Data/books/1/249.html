I could see that Holmes was favourably impressed by the manner<br/>and speech of his new client. He looked her over in his searching<br/>fashion, and then composed himself, with his lids drooping and his<br/>finger-tips together, to listen to her story.<br/><br/>"I have been a governess for five years," said she, "in the<br/>family of Colonel Spence Munro, but two months ago the colonel<br/>received an appointment at Halifax, in Nova Scotia, and took his<br/>children over to America with him, so that I found myself without a<br/>situation. I advertised, and I answered advertisements, but without<br/>success. At last the little money which I had saved began to run<br/>short, and I was at my wit's end as to what I should do.<br/><br/>"There is a well-known agency for governesses in the West End<br/>called Westaway's, and there I used to call about once a week in<br/>order to see whether anything had turned up which might suit me.<br/>Westaway was the name of the founder of the business, but it is<br/>really managed by Miss Stoper. She sits in her own little office,<br/>and the ladies who are seeking employment wait in an anteroom, and<br/>are then shown in one by one, when she consults her ledgers and<br/>sees whether she has anything which would suit them.<br/><br/>"Well, when I called last week I was shown into the little<br/>office as usual, but I found that Miss Stoper was not alone. A<br/>prodigiously stout man with a very smiling face and a great heavy<br/>chin which rolled down in fold upon fold over his throat sat at her<br/>elbow with a pair of glasses on his nose, looking very earnestly at<br/>the ladies who entered. As I came in he gave quite a jump in his<br/>chair and turned quickly to Miss Stoper.<br/><br/>"'That will do,' said he; 'I could not ask for anything better.<br/>Capital! capital!' He seemed quite enthusiastic and rubbed his<br/>hands together in the most genial fashion. He was such a<br/>comfortable-looking man that it was quite a pleasure to look at<br/>him.<br/><br/>"'You are looking for a situation, miss?' he asked.<br/><br/>"'Yes, sir.'<br/><br/>"'As governess?'<br/><br/>"'Yes, sir.'<br/><br/>"'And what salary do you ask?'<br/><br/>"'I had 4 pounds a month in my last place with Colonel Spence<br/>Munro.'<br/>
