Oh, if you do, Mr. Holmes, do<br/>tell him that I know him to be innocent."<br/><br/>"I will, Miss Turner."<br/><br/>"I must go home now, for dad is very ill, and he misses me so if<br/>I leave him. Good-bye, and God help you in your undertaking." She<br/>hurried from the room as impulsively as she had entered, and we<br/>heard the wheels of her carriage rattle off down the street.<br/><br/>"I am ashamed of you, Holmes," said Lestrade with dignity after<br/>a few minutes' silence.

I am not over-tender of heart, but I call<br/>it cruel."<br/><br/>"I think that I see my way to clearing James McCarthy," said<br/>Holmes. "Have you an order to see him in prison?"<br/><br/>"Yes, but only for you and me."<br/><br/>"Then I shall reconsider my resolution about going out. We have<br/>still time to take a train to Hereford and see him to-night?"<br/><br/>"Ample."<br/><br/>
