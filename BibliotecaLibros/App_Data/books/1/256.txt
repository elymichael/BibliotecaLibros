"You horrify me!"

"But the reason is very obvious. The pressure of public opinion
can do in the town what the law cannot accomplish. There is no lane
so vile that the scream of a tortured child, or the thud of a
drunkard's blow, does not beget sympathy and indignation among the
neighbours, and then the whole machinery of justice is ever so
close that a word of complaint can set it going, and there is but a
step between the crime and the dock. But look at these lonely
houses, each in its own fields, filled for the most part with poor
ignorant folk who know little of the law. Think of the deeds of
hellish cruelty, the hidden wickedness which may go on, year in,
year out, in such places, and none the wiser. Had this lady who
appeals to us for help gone to live in Winchester, I should never
have had a fear for her. It is the five miles of country which
makes the danger. Still, it is clear that she is not personally
threatened."

"No. If she can come to Winchester to meet us she can get
away."

"Quite so. She has her freedom."

"What CAN be the matter, then? Can you suggest no
explanation?"

"I have devised seven separate explanations, each of which would
cover the facts as far as we know them. But which of these is
correct can only be determined by the fresh information which we
shall no doubt find waiting for us. Well, there is the tower of the
cathedral, and we shall soon learn all that Miss Hunter has to
tell."

The Black Swan is an inn of repute in the High Street, at no
distance from the station, and there we found the young lady
waiting for us. She had engaged a sitting-room, and our lunch
awaited us upon the table.

"I am so delighted that you have come," she said earnestly. "It
is so very kind of you both; but indeed I do not know what I should
do. Your advice will be altogether invaluable to me."

"Pray tell us what has happened to you."

"I will do so, and I must be quick, for I have promised Mr.
Rucastle to be back before three. I got his leave to come into town
this morning, though he little knew for what purpose."
