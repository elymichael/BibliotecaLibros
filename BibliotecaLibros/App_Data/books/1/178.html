<br/>As we passed out he exchanged a few words with the landlord,<br/>explaining that we were going on a late visit to an acquaintance,<br/>and that it was possible that we might spend the night there. A<br/>moment later we were out on the dark road, a chill wind blowing in<br/>our faces, and one yellow light twinkling in front of us through<br/>the gloom to guide us on our sombre errand.<br/><br/>There was little difficulty in entering the grounds, for<br/>unrepaired breaches gaped in the old park wall. Making our way<br/>among the trees, we reached the lawn, crossed it, and were about to<br/>enter through the window when out from a clump of laurel bushes<br/>there darted what seemed to be a hideous and distorted child, who<br/>threw itself upon the grass with writhing limbs and then ran<br/>swiftly across the lawn into the darkness.<br/><br/>"My God!" I whispered; "did you see it?"<br/><br/>Holmes was for the moment as startled as I. His hand closed like<br/>a vice upon my wrist in his agitation. Then he broke into a low<br/>laugh and put his lips to my ear.<br/><br/>"It is a nice household," he murmured. "That is the baboon."<br/><br/>I had forgotten the strange pets which the doctor affected.<br/>There was a cheetah, too; perhaps we might find it upon our<br/>shoulders at any moment. I confess that I felt easier in my mind<br/>when, after following Holmes' example and slipping off my shoes, I<br/>found myself inside the bedroom. My companion noiselessly closed<br/>the shutters, moved the lamp onto the table, and cast his eyes<br/>round the room. All was as we had seen it in the daytime. Then<br/>creeping up to me and making a trumpet of his hand, he whispered<br/>into my ear again so gently that it was all that I could do to<br/>distinguish the words:<br/><br/>"The least sound would be fatal to our plans."<br/><br/>I nodded to show that I had heard.<br/><br/>"We must sit without light. He would see it through the<br/>ventilator."<br/><br/>I nodded again.<br/><br/>
