"Last Monday I had finished for the day and was dressing in my<br/>room above the opium den when I looked out of my window and saw, to<br/>my horror and astonishment, that my wife was standing in the<br/>street, with her eyes fixed full upon me. I gave a cry of surprise,<br/>threw up my arms to cover my face, and, rushing to my confidant,<br/>the Lascar, entreated him to prevent anyone from coming up to me. I<br/>heard her voice downstairs, but I knew that she could not ascend.<br/>Swiftly I threw off my clothes, pulled on those of a beggar, and<br/>put on my pigments and wig. Even a wife's eyes could not pierce so<br/>complete a disguise. But then it occurred to me that there might be<br/>a search in the room, and that the clothes might betray me. I threw<br/>open the window, reopening by my violence a small cut which I had<br/>inflicted upon myself in the bedroom that morning. Then I seized my<br/>coat, which was weighted by the coppers which I had just<br/>transferred to it from the leather bag in which I carried my<br/>takings. I hurled it out of the window, and it disappeared into the<br/>Thames. The other clothes would have followed, but at that moment<br/>there was a rush of constables up the stair, and a few minutes<br/>after I found, rather, I confess, to my relief, that instead of<br/>being identified as Mr. Neville St. Clair, I was arrested as his<br/>murderer.<br/><br/>"I do not know that there is anything else for me to explain. I<br/>was determined to preserve my disguise as long as possible, and<br/>hence my preference for a dirty face. Knowing that my wife would be<br/>terribly anxious, I slipped off my ring and confided it to the<br/>Lascar at a moment when no constable was watching me, together with<br/>a hurried scrawl, telling her that she had no cause to fear."<br/><br/>"That note only reached her yesterday," said Holmes.<br/><br/>"Good God! What a week she must have spent!"<br/><br/>"The police have watched this Lascar," said Inspector<br/>Bradstreet, "and I can quite understand that he might find it<br/>difficult to post a letter unobserved. Probably he handed it to<br/>some sailor customer of his, who forgot all about it for some<br/>days."<br/><br/>"That was it," said Holmes, nodding approvingly; "I have no<br/>doubt of it. But have you never been prosecuted for begging?"<br/><br/>"Many times; but what was a fine to me?"<br/><br/>"It must stop here, however," said Bradstreet. "If the police<br/>are to hush this thing up, there must be no more of Hugh<br/>Boone."<br/><br/>"I have sworn it by the most solemn oaths which a man can<br/>take."<br/><br/>"In that case I think that it is probable that no further steps<br/>may be taken. But if you are found again, then all must come out. I<br/>am sure, Mr. Holmes, that we are very much indebted to you for<br/>having cleared the matter up. I wish I knew how you reach your<br/>results."<br/><br/>"I reached this one," said my friend, "by sitting upon five<br/>pillows and consuming an ounce of shag. I think, Watson, that if we<br/>drive to Baker Street we shall just be in time for breakfast."<br/>
