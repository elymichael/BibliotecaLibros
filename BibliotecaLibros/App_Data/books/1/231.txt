"'You shall leave it in the hands of the police!' I cried
half-mad with grief and rage. 'I shall have this matter probed to
the bottom.'

"'You shall learn nothing from me,' said he with a passion such
as I should not have thought was in his nature. 'If you choose to
call the police, let the police find what they can.'

"By this time the whole house was astir, for I had raised my
voice in my anger. Mary was the first to rush into my room, and, at
the sight of the coronet and of Arthur's face, she read the whole
story and, with a scream, fell down senseless on the ground. I sent
the house-maid for the police and put the investigation into their
hands at once. When the inspector and a constable entered the
house, Arthur, who had stood sullenly with his arms folded, asked
me whether it was my intention to charge him with theft. I answered
that it had ceased to be a private matter, but had become a public
one, since the ruined coronet was national property. I was
determined that the law should have its way in everything.

"'At least,' said he, 'you will not have me arrested at once. It
would be to your advantage as well as mine if I might leave the
house for five minutes.'

"'That you may get away, or perhaps that you may conceal what
you have stolen,' said I. And then, realising the dreadful position
in which I was placed, I implored him to remember that not only my
honour but that of one who was far greater than I was at stake; and
that he threatened to raise a scandal which would convulse the
nation. He might avert it all if he would but tell me what he had
done with the three missing stones.

"'You may as well face the matter,' said I; 'you have been
caught in the act, and no confession could make your guilt more
heinous. If you but make such reparation as is in your power, by
telling us where the beryls are, all shall be forgiven and
forgotten.'

"'Keep your forgiveness for those who ask for it,' he answered,
turning away from me with a sneer. I saw that he was too hardened
for any words of mine to influence him. There was but one way for
it. I called in the inspector and gave him into custody. A search
was made at once not only of his person but of his room and of
every portion of the house where he could possibly have concealed
the gems; but no trace of them could be found, nor would the
wretched boy open his mouth for all our persuasions and our
threats. This morning he was removed to a cell, and I, after going
through all the police formalities, have hurried round to you to
implore you to use your skill in unravelling the matter. The police
have openly confessed that they can at present make nothing of it.
You may go to any expense which you think necessary. I have already
offered a reward of 1000 pounds. My God, what shall I do! I have
lost my honour, my gems, and my son in one night. Oh, what shall I
do!"

He put a hand on either side of his head and rocked himself to
and fro, droning to himself like a child whose grief has got beyond
words.

Sherlock Holmes sat silent for some few minutes, with his brows
knitted and his eyes fixed upon the fire.

"Do you receive much company?" he asked.
