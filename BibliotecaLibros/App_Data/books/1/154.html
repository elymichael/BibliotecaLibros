<br/>"'Oh, very well. Kill it and take it with you.'<br/><br/>"Well, I did what she said, Mr. Holmes, and I carried the bird<br/>all the way to Kilburn. I told my pal what I had done, for he was a<br/>man that it was easy to tell a thing like that to. He laughed until<br/>he choked, and we got a knife and opened the goose. My heart turned<br/>to water, for there was no sign of the stone, and I knew that some<br/>terrible mistake had occurred. I left the bird, rushed back to my<br/>sister's, and hurried into the back yard. There was not a bird to<br/>be seen there.<br/><br/>"'Where are they all, Maggie?' I cried.<br/><br/>"'Gone to the dealer's, Jem.'<br/><br/>"'Which dealer's?'<br/><br/>"'Breckinridge, of Covent Garden.'<br/><br/>"'But was there another with a barred tail?' I asked, 'the same<br/>as the one I chose?'<br/><br/>"'Yes, Jem; there were two barred-tailed ones, and I could never<br/>tell them apart.'<br/><br/>"Well, then, of course I saw it all, and I ran off as hard as my<br/>feet would carry me to this man Breckinridge; but he had sold the<br/>lot at once, and not one word would he tell me as to where they had<br/>gone. You heard him yourselves to-night. Well, he has always<br/>answered me like that. My sister thinks that I am going mad.<br/>Sometimes I think that I am myself. And nowâ€”and now I am myself a<br/>branded thief, without ever having touched the wealth for which I<br/>sold my character. God help me! God help me!" He burst into<br/>convulsive sobbing, with his face buried in his hands.<br/><br/>There was a long silence, broken only by his heavy breathing and<br/>by the measured tapping of Sherlock Holmes' finger-tips upon the<br/>edge of the table. Then my friend rose and threw open the door.<br/><br/>
