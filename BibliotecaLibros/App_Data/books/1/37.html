<br/>"It is The Morning Chronicle of April 27, 1890. Just two months<br/>ago."<br/><br/>"Very good. Now, Mr. Wilson?"<br/><br/>"Well, it is just as I have been telling you, Mr. Sherlock<br/>Holmes," said Jabez Wilson, mopping his forehead; "I have a small<br/>pawnbroker's business at Coburg Square, near the City. It's not a<br/>very large affair, and of late years it has not done more than just<br/>give me a living. I used to be able to keep two assistants, but now<br/>I only keep one; and I would have a job to pay him but that he is<br/>willing to come for half wages so as to learn the business."<br/><br/>"What is the name of this obliging youth?" asked Sherlock<br/>Holmes.<br/><br/>"His name is Vincent Spaulding, and he's not such a youth,<br/>either.
