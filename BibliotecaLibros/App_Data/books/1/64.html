"Not invisible but unnoticed, Watson. You did not know where to<br/>look, and so you missed all that was important. I can never bring<br/>you to realise the importance of sleeves, the suggestiveness of<br/>thumb-nails, or the great issues that may hang from a boot-lace.<br/>Now, what did you gather from that woman's appearance? Describe<br/>it."<br/><br/>"Well, she had a slate-coloured, broad-brimmed straw hat, with a<br/>feather of a brickish red. Her jacket was black, with black beads<br/>sewn upon it, and a fringe of little black jet ornaments. Her dress<br/>was brown, rather darker than coffee colour, with a little purple<br/>plush at the neck and sleeves. Her gloves were greyish and were<br/>worn through at the right forefinger. Her boots I didn't observe.<br/>She had small round, hanging gold earrings, and a general air of<br/>being fairly well-to-do in a vulgar, comfortable, easy-going<br/>way."<br/><br/>Sherlock Holmes clapped his hands softly together and<br/>chuckled.<br/><br/>"'Pon my word, Watson, you are coming along wonderfully. You<br/>have really done very well indeed. It is true that you have missed<br/>everything of importance, but you have hit upon the method, and you<br/>have a quick eye for colour. Never trust to general impressions, my<br/>boy, but concentrate yourself upon details. My first glance is<br/>always at a woman's sleeve. In a man it is perhaps better first to<br/>take the knee of the trouser. As you observe, this woman had plush<br/>upon her sleeves, which is a most useful material for showing<br/>traces. The double line a little above the wrist, where the<br/>typewritist presses against the table, was beautifully defined. The<br/>sewing-machine, of the hand type, leaves a similar mark, but only<br/>on the left arm, and on the side of it farthest from the thumb,<br/>instead of being right across the broadest part, as this was. I<br/>then glanced at her face, and, observing the dint of a pince-nez at<br/>either side of her nose, I ventured a remark upon short sight and<br/>typewriting, which seemed to surprise her."<br/><br/>"It surprised me."<br/><br/>"But, surely, it was obvious. I was then much surprised and<br/>interested on glancing down to observe that, though the boots which<br/>she was wearing were not unlike each other, they were really odd<br/>ones; the one having a slightly decorated toe-cap, and the other a<br/>plain one. One was buttoned only in the two lower buttons out of<br/>five, and the other at the first, third, and fifth. Now, when you<br/>see that a young lady, otherwise neatly dressed, has come away from<br/>home with odd boots, half-buttoned, it is no great deduction to say<br/>that she came away in a hurry."<br/><br/>"And what else?" I asked, keenly interested, as I always was, by<br/>my friend's incisive reasoning.<br/><br/>"I noted, in passing, that she had written a note before leaving<br/>home but after being fully dressed. You observed that her right<br/>glove was torn at the forefinger, but you did not apparently see<br/>that both glove and finger were stained with violet ink. She had<br/>written in a hurry and dipped her pen too deep. It must have been<br/>this morning, or the mark would not remain clear upon the finger.<br/>All this is amusing, though rather elementary, but I must go back<br/>to business, Watson. Would you mind reading me the advertised<br/>description of Mr. Hosmer Angel?"<br/><br/>I held the little printed slip to the light.<br/><br/>"Missing," it said, "on the morning of the fourteenth, a<br/>gentleman named Hosmer Angel. About five ft. seven in. in height;<br/>strongly built, sallow complexion, black hair, a little bald in the<br/>centre, bushy, black side-whiskers and moustache; tinted glasses,<br/>slight infirmity of speech. Was dressed, when last seen, in black<br/>frock-coat faced with silk, black waistcoat, gold Albert chain, and<br/>grey Harris tweed trousers, with brown gaiters over elastic-sided<br/>boots. Known to have been employed in an office in Leadenhall<br/>Street. Anybody bringingâ€”"<br/><br/>"That will do," said Holmes. "As to the letters," he continued,<br/>glancing over them, "they are very commonplace. Absolutely no clue<br/>in them to Mr. Angel, save that he quotes Balzac once. There is one<br/>remarkable point, however, which will no doubt strike you."<br/>
