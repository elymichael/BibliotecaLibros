<br/>"I do not wish to make a mystery," said he, laughing. "The<br/>matter was perfectly simple. You, of course, saw that everyone in<br/>the street was an accomplice. They were all engaged for the<br/>evening."<br/><br/>"I guessed as much."<br/><br/>"Then, when the row broke out, I had a little moist red paint in<br/>the palm of my hand. I rushed forward, fell down, clapped my hand<br/>to my face, and became a piteous spectacle. It is an old<br/>trick."<br/><br/>"That also I could fathom."<br/><br/>"Then they carried me in. She was bound to have me in. What else<br/>could she do? And into her sitting-room, which was the very room<br/>which I suspected. It lay between that and her bedroom, and I was<br/>determined to see which. They laid me on a couch, I motioned for<br/>air, they were compelled to open the window, and you had your<br/>chance."<br/><br/>"How did that help you?"<br/><br/>"It was all-important. When a woman thinks that her house is on<br/>fire, her instinct is at once to rush to the thing which she values<br/>most. It is a perfectly overpowering impulse, and I have more than<br/>once taken advantage of it. In the case of the Darlington<br/>substitution scandal it was of use to me, and also in the Arnsworth<br/>Castle business. A married woman grabs at her baby; an unmarried<br/>one reaches for her jewel-box. Now it was clear to me that our lady<br/>of to-day had nothing in the house more precious to her than what<br/>we are in quest of. She would rush to secure it. The alarm of fire<br/>was admirably done. The smoke and shouting were enough to shake<br/>nerves of steel. She responded beautifully. The photograph is in a<br/>recess behind a sliding panel just above the right bell-pull. She<br/>was there in an instant, and I caught a glimpse of it as she<br/>half-drew it out. When I cried out that it was a false alarm, she<br/>replaced it, glanced at the rocket, rushed from the room, and I<br/>have not seen her since. I rose, and, making my excuses, escaped<br/>from the house. I hesitated whether to attempt to secure the<br/>photograph at once; but the coachman had come in, and as he was<br/>watching me narrowly it seemed safer to wait. A little<br/>over-precipitance may ruin all."<br/><br/>"And now?" I asked.<br/><br/>"Our quest is practically finished. I shall call with the King<br/>to-morrow, and with you, if you care to come with us. We will be<br/>shown into the sitting-room to wait for the lady, but it is<br/>probable that when she comes she may find neither us nor the<br/>photograph. It might be a satisfaction to his Majesty to regain it<br/>with his own hands."<br/><br/>"And when will you call?"<br/><br/>
