"'No, I forbid you. I won't have a fuss made about such<br/>nonsense.'<br/><br/>"It was in vain to argue with him, for he was a very obstinate<br/>man. I went about, however, with a heart which was full of<br/>forebodings.<br/><br/>"On the third day after the coming of the letter my father went<br/>from home to visit an old friend of his, Major Freebody, who is in<br/>command of one of the forts upon Portsdown Hill. I was glad that he<br/>should go, for it seemed to me that he was farther from danger when<br/>he was away from home. In that, however, I was in error. Upon the<br/>second day of his absence I received a telegram from the major,<br/>imploring me to come at once. My father had fallen over one of the<br/>deep chalk-pits which abound in the neighbourhood, and was lying<br/>senseless, with a shattered skull. I hurried to him, but he passed<br/>away without having ever recovered his consciousness. He had, as it<br/>appears, been returning from Fareham in the twilight, and as the<br/>country was unknown to him, and the chalk-pit unfenced, the jury<br/>had no hesitation in bringing in a verdict of 'death from<br/>accidental causes.' Carefully as I examined every fact connected<br/>with his death, I was unable to find anything which could suggest<br/>the idea of murder. There were no signs of violence, no footmarks,<br/>no robbery, no record of strangers having been seen upon the roads.<br/>And yet I need not tell you that my mind was far from at ease, and<br/>that I was well-nigh certain that some foul plot had been woven<br/>round him.<br/><br/>"In this sinister way I came into my inheritance. You will ask<br/>me why I did not dispose of it? I answer, because I was well<br/>convinced that our troubles were in some way dependent upon an<br/>incident in my uncle's life, and that the danger would be as<br/>pressing in one house as in another.<br/><br/>"It was in January, '85, that my poor father met his end, and<br/>two years and eight months have elapsed since then. During that<br/>time I have lived happily at Horsham, and I had begun to hope that<br/>this curse had passed away from the family, and that it had ended<br/>with the last generation. I had begun to take comfort too soon,<br/>however; yesterday morning the blow fell in the very shape in which<br/>it had come upon my father."<br/><br/>The young man took from his waistcoat a crumpled envelope, and<br/>turning to the table he shook out upon it five little dried orange<br/>pips.<br/><br/>"This is the envelope," he continued. "The postmark is<br/>London—eastern division. Within are the very words which were upon<br/>my father's last message: 'K. K. K.'; and then 'Put the papers on<br/>the sundial.'"<br/><br/>"What have you done?" asked Holmes.<br/><br/>"Nothing."<br/><br/>"Nothing?"<br/><br/>"To tell the truth"—he sank his face into his thin, white<br/>hands—"I have felt helpless. I have felt like one of those poor<br/>rabbits when the snake is writhing towards it. I seem to be in the<br/>grasp of some resistless, inexorable evil, which no foresight and<br/>no precautions can guard against."<br/>
