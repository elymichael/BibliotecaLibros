<br/><br/><br/>On glancing over my notes of the seventy odd cases in which I<br/>have during the last eight years studied the methods of my friend<br/>Sherlock Holmes, I find many tragic, some comic, a large number<br/>merely strange, but none commonplace; for, working as he did rather<br/>for the love of his art than for the acquirement of wealth, he<br/>refused to associate himself with any investigation which did not<br/>tend towards the unusual, and even the fantastic. Of all these<br/>varied cases, however, I cannot recall any which presented more<br/>singular features than that which was associated with the<br/>well-known Surrey family of the Roylotts of Stoke Moran. The events<br/>in question occurred in the early days of my association with<br/>Holmes, when we were sharing rooms as bachelors in Baker Street. It<br/>is possible that I might have placed them upon record before, but a<br/>promise of secrecy was made at the time, from which I have only<br/>been freed during the last month by the untimely death of the lady<br/>to whom the pledge was given. It is perhaps as well that the facts<br/>should now come to light, for I have reasons to know that there are<br/>widespread rumours as to the death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott which<br/>tend to make the matter even more terrible than the truth.<br/><br/>It was early in April in the year '83 that I woke one morning to<br/>find Sherlock Holmes standing, fully dressed, by the side of my<br/>bed. He was a late riser, as a rule, and as the clock on the<br/>mantelpiece showed me that it was only a quarter-past seven, I<br/>blinked up at him in some surprise, and perhaps just a little<br/>resentment, for I was myself regular in my habits.<br/><br/>"Very sorry to knock you up, Watson," said he, "but it's the<br/>common lot this morning. Mrs. Hudson has been knocked up, she<br/>retorted upon me, and I on you."<br/><br/>"What is it, thenâ€”a fire?"<br/><br/>"No; a client. It seems that a young lady has arrived in a<br/>considerable state of excitement, who insists upon seeing me. She<br/>is waiting now in the sitting-room. Now, when young ladies wander<br/>about the metropolis at this hour of the morning, and knock sleepy<br/>people up out of their beds, I presume that it is something very<br/>pressing which they have to communicate. Should it prove to be an<br/>interesting case, you would, I am sure, wish to follow it from the<br/>outset. I thought, at any rate, that I should call you and give you<br/>the chance."<br/><br/>"My dear fellow, I would not miss it for anything."<br/><br/>I had no keener pleasure than in following Holmes in his<br/>professional investigations, and in admiring the rapid deductions,<br/>as swift as intuitions, and yet always founded on a logical basis<br/>with which he unravelled the problems which were submitted to him.<br/>I rapidly threw on my clothes and was ready in a few minutes to<br/>accompany my friend down to the sitting-room. A lady dressed in<br/>black and heavily veiled, who had been sitting in the window, rose<br/>as we entered.<br/><br/>"Good-morning, madam," said Holmes cheerily. "My name is<br/>Sherlock Holmes. This is my intimate friend and associate, Dr.<br/>Watson, before whom you can speak as freely as before myself. Ha! I<br/>am glad to see that Mrs. Hudson has had the good sense to light the<br/>fire. Pray draw up to it, and I shall order you a cup of hot<br/>coffee, for I observe that you are shivering."<br/><br/>"It is not cold which makes me shiver," said the woman in a low<br/>voice, changing her seat as requested.<br/><br/>"What, then?"<br/>
