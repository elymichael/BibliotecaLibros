"What will you say?"

"Give me a pencil and that slip of paper. Now, then: 'Found at
the corner of Goodge Street, a goose and a black felt hat. Mr.
Henry Baker can have the same by applying at 6:30 this evening at
221B, Baker Street.' That is clear and concise."

"Very. But will he see it?"

"Well, he is sure to keep an eye on the papers, since, to a poor
man, the loss was a heavy one. He was clearly so scared by his
mischance in breaking the window and by the approach of Peterson
that he thought of nothing but flight, but since then he must have
bitterly regretted the impulse which caused him to drop his bird.
Then, again, the introduction of his name will cause him to see it,
for everyone who knows him will direct his attention to it. Here
you are, Peterson, run down to the advertising agency and have this
put in the evening papers."

"In which, sir?"

"Oh, in the Globe, Star, Pall Mall, St. James's, Evening News,
Standard, Echo, and any others that occur to you."

"Very well, sir. And this stone?"

"Ah, yes, I shall keep the stone. Thank you. And, I say,
Peterson, just buy a goose on your way back and leave it here with
me, for we must have one to give to this gentleman in place of the
one which your family is now devouring."

When the commissionaire had gone, Holmes took up the stone and
held it against the light. "It's a bonny thing," said he. "Just see
how it glints and sparkles. Of course it is a nucleus and focus of
crime. Every good stone is. They are the devil's pet baits. In the
larger and older jewels every facet may stand for a bloody deed.
This stone is not yet twenty years old. It was found in the banks
of the Amoy River in southern China and is remarkable in having
every characteristic of the carbuncle, save that it is blue in
shade instead of ruby red. In spite of its youth, it has already a
sinister history. There have been two murders, a vitriol-throwing,
a suicide, and several robberies brought about for the sake of this
forty-grain weight of crystallised charcoal. Who would think that
so pretty a toy would be a purveyor to the gallows and the prison?
I'll lock it up in my strong box now and drop a line to the
Countess to say that we have it."

"Do you think that this man Horner is innocent?"

"I cannot tell."
