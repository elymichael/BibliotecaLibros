"No, I never heard of her using it. We used always to get what<br/>we wanted for ourselves."<br/><br/>"Indeed, it seemed unnecessary to put so nice a bell-pull there.<br/>You will excuse me for a few minutes while I satisfy myself as to<br/>this floor." He threw himself down upon his face with his lens in<br/>his hand and crawled swiftly backward and forward, examining<br/>minutely the cracks between the boards. Then he did the same with<br/>the wood-work with which the chamber was panelled. Finally he<br/>walked over to the bed and spent some time in staring at it and in<br/>running his eye up and down the wall. Finally he took the bell-rope<br/>in his hand and gave it a brisk tug.<br/><br/>"Why, it's a dummy," said he.<br/><br/>"Won't it ring?"<br/><br/>"No, it is not even attached to a wire. This is very<br/>interesting. You can see now that it is fastened to a hook just<br/>above where the little opening for the ventilator is."<br/><br/>"How very absurd! I never noticed that before."<br/><br/>"Very strange!" muttered Holmes, pulling at the rope. "There are<br/>one or two very singular points about this room. For example, what<br/>a fool a builder must be to open a ventilator into another room,<br/>when, with the same trouble, he might have communicated with the<br/>outside air!"<br/><br/>"That is also quite modern," said the lady.<br/><br/>"Done about the same time as the bell-rope?" remarked<br/>Holmes.<br/><br/>"Yes, there were several little changes carried out about that<br/>time."<br/><br/>"They seem to have been of a most interesting characterâ€”dummy<br/>bell-ropes, and ventilators which do not ventilate. With your<br/>permission, Miss Stoner, we shall now carry our researches into the<br/>inner apartment."<br/>
