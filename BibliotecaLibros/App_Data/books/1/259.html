"You will find it rather disconnected, I fear, and there may<br/>prove to be little relation between the different incidents of<br/>which I speak. On the very first day that I was at the Copper<br/>Beeches, Mr. Rucastle took me to a small outhouse which stands near<br/>the kitchen door. As we approached it I heard the sharp rattling of<br/>a chain, and the sound as of a large animal moving about.<br/><br/>"'Look in here!' said Mr. Rucastle, showing me a slit between<br/>two planks. 'Is he not a beauty?'<br/><br/>"I looked through and was conscious of two glowing eyes, and of<br/>a vague figure huddled up in the darkness.<br/><br/>"'Don't be frightened,' said my employer, laughing at the start<br/>which I had given. 'It's only Carlo, my mastiff. I call him mine,<br/>but really old Toller, my groom, is the only man who can do<br/>anything with him. We feed him once a day, and not too much then,<br/>so that he is always as keen as mustard. Toller lets him loose<br/>every night, and God help the trespasser whom he lays his fangs<br/>upon. For goodness' sake don't you ever on any pretext set your<br/>foot over the threshold at night, for it's as much as your life is<br/>worth.'<br/><br/>"The warning was no idle one, for two nights later I happened to<br/>look out of my bedroom window about two o'clock in the morning. It<br/>was a beautiful moonlight night, and the lawn in front of the house<br/>was silvered over and almost as bright as day. I was standing, rapt<br/>in the peaceful beauty of the scene, when I was aware that<br/>something was moving under the shadow of the copper beeches. As it<br/>emerged into the moonshine I saw what it was. It was a giant dog,<br/>as large as a calf, tawny tinted, with hanging jowl, black muzzle,<br/>and huge projecting bones. It walked slowly across the lawn and<br/>vanished into the shadow upon the other side. That dreadful<br/>sentinel sent a chill to my heart which I do not think that any<br/>burglar could have done.<br/><br/>"And now I have a very strange experience to tell you. I had, as<br/>you know, cut off my hair in London, and I had placed it in a great<br/>coil at the bottom of my trunk. One evening, after the child was in<br/>bed, I began to amuse myself by examining the furniture of my room<br/>and by rearranging my own little things. There was an old chest of<br/>drawers in the room, the two upper ones empty and open, the lower<br/>one locked. I had filled the first two with my linen, and as I had<br/>still much to pack away I was naturally annoyed at not having the<br/>use of the third drawer. It struck me that it might have been<br/>fastened by a mere oversight, so I took out my bunch of keys and<br/>tried to open it. The very first key fitted to perfection, and I<br/>drew the drawer open. There was only one thing in it, but I am sure<br/>that you would never guess what it was. It was my coil of hair.<br/><br/>"I took it up and examined it. It was of the same peculiar tint,<br/>and the same thickness. But then the impossibility of the thing<br/>obtruded itself upon me. How could my hair have been locked in the<br/>drawer? With trembling hands I undid my trunk, turned out the<br/>contents, and drew from the bottom my own hair. I laid the two<br/>tresses together, and I assure you that they were identical. Was it<br/>not extraordinary? Puzzle as I would, I could make nothing at all<br/>of what it meant. I returned the strange hair to the drawer, and I<br/>said nothing of the matter to the Rucastles as I felt that I had<br/>put myself in the wrong by opening a drawer which they had<br/>locked.<br/><br/>"I am naturally observant, as you may have remarked, Mr. Holmes,<br/>and I soon had a pretty good plan of the whole house in my head.<br/>There was one wing, however, which appeared not to be inhabited at<br/>all. A door which faced that which led into the quarters of the<br/>Tollers opened into this suite, but it was invariably locked. One<br/>day, however, as I ascended the stair, I met Mr. Rucastle coming<br/>out through this door, his keys in his hand, and a look on his face<br/>which made him a very different person to the round, jovial man to<br/>whom I was accustomed. His cheeks were red, his brow was all<br/>crinkled with anger, and the veins stood out at his temples with<br/>passion. He locked the door and hurried past me without a word or a<br/>look.<br/><br/>"This aroused my curiosity, so when I went out for a walk in the<br/>grounds with my charge, I strolled round to the side from which I<br/>could see the windows of this part of the house. There were four of<br/>them in a row, three of which were simply dirty, while the fourth<br/>was shuttered up. They were evidently all deserted. As I strolled<br/>up and down, glancing at them occasionally, Mr. Rucastle came out<br/>to me, looking as merry and jovial as ever.<br/><br/>"'Ah!' said he, 'you must not think me rude if I passed you<br/>without a word, my dear young lady. I was preoccupied with business<br/>matters.'<br/><br/>"I assured him that I was not offended. 'By the way,' said I,<br/>'you seem to have quite a suite of spare rooms up there, and one of<br/>them has the shutters up.'<br/>
