"'Ah!' said he carelessly, 'we have our own process. We compress<br/>the earth into bricks, so as to remove them without revealing what<br/>they are. But that is a mere detail. I have taken you fully into my<br/>confidence now, Mr. Hatherley, and I have shown you how I trust<br/>you.' He rose as he spoke. 'I shall expect you, then, at Eyford at<br/>11:15.'<br/><br/>"'I shall certainly be there.'<br/><br/>"'And not a word to a soul.' He looked at me with a last long,<br/>questioning gaze, and then, pressing my hand in a cold, dank grasp,<br/>he hurried from the room.<br/><br/>"Well, when I came to think it all over in cool blood I was very<br/>much astonished, as you may both think, at this sudden commission<br/>which had been intrusted to me. On the one hand, of course, I was<br/>glad, for the fee was at least tenfold what I should have asked had<br/>I set a price upon my own services, and it was possible that this<br/>order might lead to other ones. On the other hand, the face and<br/>manner of my patron had made an unpleasant impression upon me, and<br/>I could not think that his explanation of the fuller's-earth was<br/>sufficient to explain the necessity for my coming at midnight, and<br/>his extreme anxiety lest I should tell anyone of my errand.<br/>However, I threw all fears to the winds, ate a hearty supper, drove<br/>to Paddington, and started off, having obeyed to the letter the<br/>injunction as to holding my tongue.<br/><br/>"At Reading I had to change not only my carriage but my station.<br/>However, I was in time for the last train to Eyford, and I reached<br/>the little dim-lit station after eleven o'clock. I was the only<br/>passenger who got out there, and there was no one upon the platform<br/>save a single sleepy porter with a lantern. As I passed out through<br/>the wicket gate, however, I found my acquaintance of the morning<br/>waiting in the shadow upon the other side. Without a word he<br/>grasped my arm and hurried me into a carriage, the door of which<br/>was standing open. He drew up the windows on either side, tapped on<br/>the wood-work, and away we went as fast as the horse could go."<br/><br/>"One horse?" interjected Holmes.<br/><br/>"Yes, only one."<br/><br/>"Did you observe the colour?"<br/><br/>"Yes, I saw it by the side-lights when I was stepping into the<br/>carriage. It was a chestnut."<br/><br/>"Tired-looking or fresh?"<br/><br/>"Oh, fresh and glossy."<br/>
