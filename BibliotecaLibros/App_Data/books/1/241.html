<br/>It was, indeed, our friend the financier. I was shocked by the<br/>change which had come over him, for his face which was naturally of<br/>a broad and massive mould, was now pinched and fallen in, while his<br/>hair seemed to me at least a shade whiter. He entered with a<br/>weariness and lethargy which was even more painful than his<br/>violence of the morning before, and he dropped heavily into the<br/>armchair which I pushed forward for him.<br/><br/>"I do not know what I have done to be so severely tried," said<br/>he. "Only two days ago I was a happy and prosperous man, without a<br/>care in the world. Now I am left to a lonely and dishonoured age.<br/>One sorrow comes close upon the heels of another. My niece, Mary,<br/>has deserted me."<br/><br/>"Deserted you?"<br/><br/>"Yes. Her bed this morning had not been slept in, her room was<br/>empty, and a note for me lay upon the hall table. I had said to her<br/>last night, in sorrow and not in anger, that if she had married my<br/>boy all might have been well with him. Perhaps it was thoughtless<br/>of me to say so. It is to that remark that she refers in this<br/>note:<br/><br/>"'MY DEAREST UNCLE:—I feel that I have brought trouble upon you,<br/>and that if I had acted differently this terrible misfortune might<br/>never have occurred. I cannot, with this thought in my mind, ever<br/>again be happy under your roof, and I feel that I must leave you<br/>forever. Do not worry about my future, for that is provided for;<br/>and, above all, do not search for me, for it will be fruitless<br/>labour and an ill-service to me. In life or in death, I am ever<br/>your loving,—MARY.'<br/><br/>"What could she mean by that note, Mr. Holmes? Do you think it<br/>points to suicide?"<br/><br/>"No, no, nothing of the kind. It is perhaps the best possible<br/>solution. I trust, Mr. Holder, that you are nearing the end of your<br/>troubles."<br/><br/>"Ha! You say so! You have heard something, Mr. Holmes; you have<br/>learned something! Where are the gems?"<br/><br/>"You would not think 1000 pounds apiece an excessive sum for<br/>them?"<br/><br/>"I would pay ten."<br/><br/>
