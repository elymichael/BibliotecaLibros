"I believe, Mr. Holmes, that you have already made up your<br/>mind," said Miss Stoner, laying her hand upon my companion's<br/>sleeve.<br/><br/>"Perhaps I have."<br/><br/>"Then, for pity's sake, tell me what was the cause of my<br/>sister's death."<br/><br/>"I should prefer to have clearer proofs before I speak."<br/><br/>"You can at least tell me whether my own thought is correct, and<br/>if she died from some sudden fright."<br/><br/>"No, I do not think so. I think that there was probably some<br/>more tangible cause. And now, Miss Stoner, we must leave you for if<br/>Dr. Roylott returned and saw us our journey would be in vain.<br/>Good-bye, and be brave, for if you will do what I have told you,<br/>you may rest assured that we shall soon drive away the dangers that<br/>threaten you."<br/><br/>Sherlock Holmes and I had no difficulty in engaging a bedroom<br/>and sitting-room at the Crown Inn. They were on the upper floor,<br/>and from our window we could command a view of the avenue gate, and<br/>of the inhabited wing of Stoke Moran Manor House. At dusk we saw<br/>Dr. Grimesby Roylott drive past, his huge form looming up beside<br/>the little figure of the lad who drove him. The boy had some slight<br/>difficulty in undoing the heavy iron gates, and we heard the hoarse<br/>roar of the doctor's voice and saw the fury with which he shook his<br/>clinched fists at him. The trap drove on, and a few minutes later<br/>we saw a sudden light spring up among the trees as the lamp was lit<br/>in one of the sitting-rooms.<br/><br/>"Do you know, Watson," said Holmes as we sat together in the<br/>gathering darkness, "I have really some scruples as to taking you<br/>to-night. There is a distinct element of danger."<br/><br/>"Can I be of assistance?"<br/><br/>"Your presence might be invaluable."<br/><br/>"Then I shall certainly come."<br/>
