<br/>"'You shall leave it in the hands of the police!' I cried<br/>half-mad with grief and rage. 'I shall have this matter probed to<br/>the bottom.'<br/><br/>"'You shall learn nothing from me,' said he with a passion such<br/>as I should not have thought was in his nature. 'If you choose to<br/>call the police, let the police find what they can.'<br/><br/>"By this time the whole house was astir, for I had raised my<br/>voice in my anger. Mary was the first to rush into my room, and, at<br/>the sight of the coronet and of Arthur's face, she read the whole<br/>story and, with a scream, fell down senseless on the ground. I sent<br/>the house-maid for the police and put the investigation into their<br/>hands at once. When the inspector and a constable entered the<br/>house, Arthur, who had stood sullenly with his arms folded, asked<br/>me whether it was my intention to charge him with theft. I answered<br/>that it had ceased to be a private matter, but had become a public<br/>one, since the ruined coronet was national property. I was<br/>determined that the law should have its way in everything.<br/><br/>"'At least,' said he, 'you will not have me arrested at once. It<br/>would be to your advantage as well as mine if I might leave the<br/>house for five minutes.'<br/><br/>"'That you may get away, or perhaps that you may conceal what<br/>you have stolen,' said I. And then, realising the dreadful position<br/>in which I was placed, I implored him to remember that not only my<br/>honour but that of one who was far greater than I was at stake; and<br/>that he threatened to raise a scandal which would convulse the<br/>nation. He might avert it all if he would but tell me what he had<br/>done with the three missing stones.<br/><br/>"'You may as well face the matter,' said I; 'you have been<br/>caught in the act, and no confession could make your guilt more<br/>heinous. If you but make such reparation as is in your power, by<br/>telling us where the beryls are, all shall be forgiven and<br/>forgotten.'<br/><br/>"'Keep your forgiveness for those who ask for it,' he answered,<br/>turning away from me with a sneer. I saw that he was too hardened<br/>for any words of mine to influence him. There was but one way for<br/>it. I called in the inspector and gave him into custody. A search<br/>was made at once not only of his person but of his room and of<br/>every portion of the house where he could possibly have concealed<br/>the gems; but no trace of them could be found, nor would the<br/>wretched boy open his mouth for all our persuasions and our<br/>threats. This morning he was removed to a cell, and I, after going<br/>through all the police formalities, have hurried round to you to<br/>implore you to use your skill in unravelling the matter. The police<br/>have openly confessed that they can at present make nothing of it.<br/>You may go to any expense which you think necessary. I have already<br/>offered a reward of 1000 pounds. My God, what shall I do! I have<br/>lost my honour, my gems, and my son in one night. Oh, what shall I<br/>do!"<br/><br/>He put a hand on either side of his head and rocked himself to<br/>and fro, droning to himself like a child whose grief has got beyond<br/>words.<br/><br/>Sherlock Holmes sat silent for some few minutes, with his brows<br/>knitted and his eyes fixed upon the fire.<br/><br/>"Do you receive much company?" he asked.<br/><br/>
