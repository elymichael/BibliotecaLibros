"Yes. It was the bisulphate of baryta."<br/><br/>"No, no, the mystery!" I cried.<br/><br/>"Oh, that! I thought of the salt that I have been working upon.<br/>There was never any mystery in the matter, though, as I said<br/>yesterday, some of the details are of interest. The only drawback<br/>is that there is no law, I fear, that can touch the scoundrel."<br/><br/>"Who was he, then, and what was his object in deserting Miss<br/>Sutherland?"<br/><br/>The question was hardly out of my mouth, and Holmes had not yet<br/>opened his lips to reply, when we heard a heavy footfall in the<br/>passage and a tap at the door.<br/><br/>"This is the girl's stepfather, Mr. James Windibank," said<br/>Holmes. "He has written to me to say that he would be here at six.<br/>Come in!"<br/><br/>The man who entered was a sturdy, middle-sized fellow, some<br/>thirty years of age, clean-shaven, and sallow-skinned, with a<br/>bland, insinuating manner, and a pair of wonderfully sharp and<br/>penetrating grey eyes. He shot a questioning glance at each of us,<br/>placed his shiny top-hat upon the sideboard, and with a slight bow<br/>sidled down into the nearest chair.<br/><br/>"Good-evening, Mr. James Windibank," said Holmes. "I think that<br/>this typewritten letter is from you, in which you made an<br/>appointment with me for six o'clock?"<br/><br/>"Yes, sir. I am afraid that I am a little late, but I am not<br/>quite my own master, you know. I am sorry that Miss Sutherland has<br/>troubled you about this little matter, for I think it is far better<br/>not to wash linen of the sort in public. It was quite against my<br/>wishes that she came, but she is a very excitable, impulsive girl,<br/>as you may have noticed, and she is not easily controlled when she<br/>has made up her mind on a point. Of course, I did not mind you so<br/>much, as you are not connected with the official police, but it is<br/>not pleasant to have a family misfortune like this noised abroad.<br/>Besides, it is a useless expense, for how could you possibly find<br/>this Hosmer Angel?"<br/><br/>"On the contrary," said Holmes quietly; "I have every reason to<br/>believe that I will succeed in discovering Mr. Hosmer Angel."<br/><br/>Mr. Windibank gave a violent start and dropped his gloves. "I am<br/>delighted to hear it," he said.<br/>
