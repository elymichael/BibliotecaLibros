<br/>"Not in the least. Is it possible that even now, when I give you<br/>these results, you are unable to see how they are attained?"<br/><br/>"I have no doubt that I am very stupid, but I must confess that<br/>I am unable to follow you. For example, how did you deduce that<br/>this man was intellectual?"<br/><br/>For answer Holmes clapped the hat upon his head. It came right<br/>over the forehead and settled upon the bridge of his nose. "It is a<br/>question of cubic capacity," said he; "a man with so large a brain<br/>must have something in it."<br/><br/>"The decline of his fortunes, then?"<br/><br/>"This hat is three years old. These flat brims curled at the<br/>edge came in then. It is a hat of the very best quality. Look at<br/>the band of ribbed silk and the excellent lining. If this man could<br/>afford to buy so expensive a hat three years ago, and has had no<br/>hat since, then he has assuredly gone down in the world."<br/><br/>"Well, that is clear enough, certainly. But how about the<br/>foresight and the moral retrogression?"<br/><br/>Sherlock Holmes laughed. "Here is the foresight," said he<br/>putting his finger upon the little disc and loop of the<br/>hat-securer. "They are never sold upon hats. If this man ordered<br/>one, it is a sign of a certain amount of foresight, since he went<br/>out of his way to take this precaution against the wind. But since<br/>we see that he has broken the elastic and has not troubled to<br/>replace it, it is obvious that he has less foresight now than<br/>formerly, which is a distinct proof of a weakening nature. On the<br/>other hand, he has endeavoured to conceal some of these stains upon<br/>the felt by daubing them with ink, which is a sign that he has not<br/>entirely lost his self-respect."<br/><br/>"Your reasoning is certainly plausible."<br/><br/>"The further points, that he is middle-aged, that his hair is<br/>grizzled, that it has been recently cut, and that he uses<br/>lime-cream, are all to be gathered from a close examination of the<br/>lower part of the lining. The lens discloses a large number of<br/>hair-ends, clean cut by the scissors of the barber. They all appear<br/>to be adhesive, and there is a distinct odour of lime-cream. This<br/>dust, you will observe, is not the gritty, grey dust of the street<br/>but the fluffy brown dust of the house, showing that it has been<br/>hung up indoors most of the time, while the marks of moisture upon<br/>the inside are proof positive that the wearer perspired very<br/>freely, and could therefore, hardly be in the best of<br/>training."<br/><br/>"But his wifeâ€”you said that she had ceased to love him."<br/><br/>
