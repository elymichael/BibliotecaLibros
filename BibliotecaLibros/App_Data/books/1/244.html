"You then roused his anger by calling him names at a moment when<br/>he felt that he had deserved your warmest thanks. He could not<br/>explain the true state of affairs without betraying one who<br/>certainly deserved little enough consideration at his hands. He<br/>took the more chivalrous view, however, and preserved her<br/>secret."<br/><br/>"And that was why she shrieked and fainted when she saw the<br/>coronet," cried Mr. Holder. "Oh, my God! what a blind fool I have<br/>been! And his asking to be allowed to go out for five minutes! The<br/>dear fellow wanted to see if the missing piece were at the scene of<br/>the struggle. How cruelly I have misjudged him!"<br/><br/>"When I arrived at the house," continued Holmes, "I at once went<br/>very carefully round it to observe if there were any traces in the<br/>snow which might help me. I knew that none had fallen since the<br/>evening before, and also that there had been a strong frost to<br/>preserve impressions. I passed along the tradesmen's path, but<br/>found it all trampled down and indistinguishable. Just beyond it,<br/>however, at the far side of the kitchen door, a woman had stood and<br/>talked with a man, whose round impressions on one side showed that<br/>he had a wooden leg. I could even tell that they had been<br/>disturbed, for the woman had run back swiftly to the door, as was<br/>shown by the deep toe and light heel marks, while Wooden-leg had<br/>waited a little, and then had gone away. I thought at the time that<br/>this might be the maid and her sweetheart, of whom you had already<br/>spoken to me, and inquiry showed it was so. I passed round the<br/>garden without seeing anything more than random tracks, which I<br/>took to be the police; but when I got into the stable lane a very<br/>long and complex story was written in the snow in front of me.<br/><br/>"There was a double line of tracks of a booted man, and a second<br/>double line which I saw with delight belonged to a man with naked<br/>feet. I was at once convinced from what you had told me that the<br/>latter was your son. The first had walked both ways, but the other<br/>had run swiftly, and as his tread was marked in places over the<br/>depression of the boot, it was obvious that he had passed after the<br/>other. I followed them up and found they led to the hall window,<br/>where Boots had worn all the snow away while waiting. Then I walked<br/>to the other end, which was a hundred yards or more down the lane.<br/>I saw where Boots had faced round, where the snow was cut up as<br/>though there had been a struggle, and, finally, where a few drops<br/>of blood had fallen, to show me that I was not mistaken. Boots had<br/>then run down the lane, and another little smudge of blood showed<br/>that it was he who had been hurt. When he came to the highroad at<br/>the other end, I found that the pavement had been cleared, so there<br/>was an end to that clue.<br/><br/>"On entering the house, however, I examined, as you remember,<br/>the sill and framework of the hall window with my lens, and I could<br/>at once see that someone had passed out. I could distinguish the<br/>outline of an instep where the wet foot had been placed in coming<br/>in. I was then beginning to be able to form an opinion as to what<br/>had occurred. A man had waited outside the window; someone had<br/>brought the gems; the deed had been overseen by your son; he had<br/>pursued the thief; had struggled with him; they had each tugged at<br/>the coronet, their united strength causing injuries which neither<br/>alone could have effected. He had returned with the prize, but had<br/>left a fragment in the grasp of his opponent. So far I was clear.<br/>The question now was, who was the man and who was it brought him<br/>the coronet?<br/><br/>"It is an old maxim of mine that when you have excluded the<br/>impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the<br/>truth. Now, I knew that it was not you who had brought it down, so<br/>there only remained your niece and the maids. But if it were the<br/>maids, why should your son allow himself to be accused in their<br/>place? There could be no possible reason. As he loved his cousin,<br/>however, there was an excellent explanation why he should retain<br/>her secret—the more so as the secret was a disgraceful one. When I<br/>remembered that you had seen her at that window, and how she had<br/>fainted on seeing the coronet again, my conjecture became a<br/>certainty.<br/><br/>"And who could it be who was her confederate? A lover evidently,<br/>for who else could outweigh the love and gratitude which she must<br/>feel to you? I knew that you went out little, and that your circle<br/>of friends was a very limited one. But among them was Sir George<br/>Burnwell. I had heard of him before as being a man of evil<br/>reputation among women. It must have been he who wore those boots<br/>and retained the missing gems. Even though he knew that Arthur had<br/>discovered him, he might still flatter himself that he was safe,<br/>for the lad could not say a word without compromising his own<br/>family.<br/><br/>"Well, your own good sense will suggest what measures I took<br/>next. I went in the shape of a loafer to Sir George's house,<br/>managed to pick up an acquaintance with his valet, learned that his<br/>master had cut his head the night before, and, finally, at the<br/>expense of six shillings, made all sure by buying a pair of his<br/>cast-off shoes. With these I journeyed down to Streatham and saw<br/>that they exactly fitted the tracks."<br/><br/>"I saw an ill-dressed vagabond in the lane yesterday evening,"<br/>said Mr. Holder.<br/><br/>"Precisely. It was I. I found that I had my man, so I came home<br/>and changed my clothes. It was a delicate part which I had to play<br/>then, for I saw that a prosecution must be avoided to avert<br/>scandal, and I knew that so astute a villain would see that our<br/>hands were tied in the matter. I went and saw him. At first, of<br/>course, he denied everything. But when I gave him every particular<br/>that had occurred, he tried to bluster and took down a<br/>life-preserver from the wall. I knew my man, however, and I clapped<br/>a pistol to his head before he could strike. Then he became a<br/>little more reasonable. I told him that we would give him a price<br/>for the stones he held—1000 pounds apiece. That brought out the<br/>first signs of grief that he had shown. 'Why, dash it all!' said<br/>he, 'I've let them go at six hundred for the three!' I soon managed<br/>to get the address of the receiver who had them, on promising him<br/>that there would be no prosecution. Off I set to him, and after<br/>much chaffering I got our stones at 1000 pounds apiece. Then I<br/>looked in upon your son, told him that all was right, and<br/>eventually got to my bed about two o'clock, after what I may call a<br/>really hard day's work."<br/><br/>"A day which has saved England from a great public scandal,"<br/>said the banker, rising. "Sir, I cannot find words to thank you,<br/>but you shall not find me ungrateful for what you have done. Your<br/>skill has indeed exceeded all that I have heard of it. And now I<br/>must fly to my dear boy to apologise to him for the wrong which I<br/>have done him. As to what you tell me of poor Mary, it goes to my<br/>very heart. Not even your skill can inform me where she is<br/>now."<br/>
