"In what way?" asked Holmes.<br/><br/>"It is no time for me to hide anything. James and his father had<br/>many disagreements about me. Mr. McCarthy was very anxious that<br/>there should be a marriage between us. James and I have always<br/>loved each other as brother and sister; but of course he is young<br/>and has seen very little of life yet, and—and—well, he naturally<br/>did not wish to do anything like that yet. So there were quarrels,<br/>and this, I am sure, was one of them."<br/><br/>"And your father?" asked Holmes. "Was he in favour of such a<br/>union?"<br/><br/>"No, he was averse to it also. No one but Mr. McCarthy was in<br/>favour of it." A quick blush passed over her fresh young face as<br/>Holmes shot one of his keen, questioning glances at her.<br/><br/>"Thank you for this information," said he. "May I see your<br/>father if I call to-morrow?"<br/><br/>"I am afraid the doctor won't allow it."<br/><br/>"The doctor?"<br/><br/>"Yes, have you not heard? Poor father has never been strong for<br/>years back, but this has broken him down completely. He has taken<br/>to his bed, and Dr. Willows says that he is a wreck and that his<br/>nervous system is shattered. Mr. McCarthy was the only man alive<br/>who had known dad in the old days in Victoria."<br/><br/>"Ha! In Victoria! That is important."<br/><br/>"Yes, at the mines."<br/><br/>"Quite so; at the gold-mines, where, as I understand, Mr. Turner<br/>made his money."<br/>
