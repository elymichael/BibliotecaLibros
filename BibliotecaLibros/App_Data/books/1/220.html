<br/>"Pray make no apology to me," said Lord St. Simon bitterly.<br/><br/>"Oh, yes, I know that I have treated you real bad and that I<br/>should have spoken to you before I went; but I was kind of rattled,<br/>and from the time when I saw Frank here again I just didn't know<br/>what I was doing or saying. I only wonder I didn't fall down and do<br/>a faint right there before the altar."<br/><br/>"Perhaps, Mrs. Moulton, you would like my friend and me to leave<br/>the room while you explain this matter?"<br/><br/>"If I may give an opinion," remarked the strange gentleman,<br/>"we've had just a little too much secrecy over this business<br/>already. For my part, I should like all Europe and America to hear<br/>the rights of it." He was a small, wiry, sunburnt man,<br/>clean-shaven, with a sharp face and alert manner.<br/><br/>"Then I'll tell our story right away," said the lady. "Frank<br/>here and I met in '84, in McQuire's camp, near the Rockies, where<br/>pa was working a claim. We were engaged to each other, Frank and I;<br/>but then one day father struck a rich pocket and made a pile, while<br/>poor Frank here had a claim that petered out and came to nothing.<br/>The richer pa grew the poorer was Frank; so at last pa wouldn't<br/>hear of our engagement lasting any longer, and he took me away to<br/>'Frisco. Frank wouldn't throw up his hand, though; so he followed<br/>me there, and he saw me without pa knowing anything about it. It<br/>would only have made him mad to know, so we just fixed it all up<br/>for ourselves. Frank said that he would go and make his pile, too,<br/>and never come back to claim me until he had as much as pa. So then<br/>I promised to wait for him to the end of time and pledged myself<br/>not to marry anyone else while he lived. 'Why shouldn't we be<br/>married right away, then,' said he, 'and then I will feel sure of<br/>you; and I won't claim to be your husband until I come back?' Well,<br/>we talked it over, and he had fixed it all up so nicely, with a<br/>clergyman all ready in waiting, that we just did it right there;<br/>and then Frank went off to seek his fortune, and I went back to<br/>pa.<br/><br/>"The next I heard of Frank was that he was in Montana, and then<br/>he went prospecting in Arizona, and then I heard of him from New<br/>Mexico. After that came a long newspaper story about how a miners'<br/>camp had been attacked by Apache Indians, and there was my Frank's<br/>name among the killed. I fainted dead away, and I was very sick for<br/>months after. Pa thought I had a decline and took me to half the<br/>doctors in 'Frisco. Not a word of news came for a year and more, so<br/>that I never doubted that Frank was really dead. Then Lord St.<br/>Simon came to 'Frisco, and we came to London, and a marriage was<br/>arranged, and pa was very pleased, but I felt all the time that no<br/>man on this earth would ever take the place in my heart that had<br/>been given to my poor Frank.<br/><br/>"Still, if I had married Lord St. Simon, of course I'd have done<br/>my duty by him. We can't command our love, but we can our actions.<br/>I went to the altar with him with the intention to make him just as<br/>good a wife as it was in me to be. But you may imagine what I felt<br/>when, just as I came to the altar rails, I glanced back and saw<br/>Frank standing and looking at me out of the first pew. I thought it<br/>was his ghost at first; but when I looked again there he was still,<br/>with a kind of question in his eyes, as if to ask me whether I were<br/>glad or sorry to see him. I wonder I didn't drop. I know that<br/>everything was turning round, and the words of the clergyman were<br/>just like the buzz of a bee in my ear. I didn't know what to do.<br/>Should I stop the service and make a scene in the church? I glanced<br/>at him again, and he seemed to know what I was thinking, for he<br/>raised his finger to his lips to tell me to be still. Then I saw<br/>him scribble on a piece of paper, and I knew that he was writing me<br/>a note. As I passed his pew on the way out I dropped my bouquet<br/>over to him, and he slipped the note into my hand when he returned<br/>me the flowers. It was only a line asking me to join him when he<br/>made the sign to me to do so. Of course I never doubted for a<br/>moment that my first duty was now to him, and I determined to do<br/>just whatever he might direct.<br/><br/>"When I got back I told my maid, who had known him in<br/>California, and had always been his friend. I ordered her to say<br/>nothing, but to get a few things packed and my ulster ready. I know<br/>I ought to have spoken to Lord St. Simon, but it was dreadful hard<br/>before his mother and all those great people. I just made up my<br/>mind to run away and explain afterwards. I hadn't been at the table<br/>ten minutes before I saw Frank out of the window at the other side<br/>of the road. He beckoned to me and then began walking into the<br/>Park. I slipped out, put on my things, and followed him. Some woman<br/>came talking something or other about Lord St. Simon to me—seemed<br/>to me from the little I heard as if he had a little secret of his<br/>own before marriage also—but I managed to get away from her and<br/>soon overtook Frank. We got into a cab together, and away we drove<br/>to some lodgings he had taken in Gordon Square, and that was my<br/>true wedding after all those years of waiting. Frank had been a<br/>prisoner among the Apaches, had escaped, came on to 'Frisco, found<br/>that I had given him up for dead and had gone to England, followed<br/>me there, and had come upon me at last on the very morning of my<br/>second wedding."<br/><br/>"I saw it in a paper," explained the American. "It gave the name<br/>and the church but not where the lady lived."<br/><br/>"Then we had a talk as to what we should do, and Frank was all<br/>for openness, but I was so ashamed of it all that I felt as if I<br/>should like to vanish away and never see any of them again—just<br/>sending a line to pa, perhaps, to show him that I was alive. It was<br/>awful to me to think of all those lords and ladies sitting round<br/>that breakfast-table and waiting for me to come back. So Frank took<br/>my wedding-clothes and things and made a bundle of them, so that I<br/>should not be traced, and dropped them away somewhere where no one<br/>could find them. It is likely that we should have gone on to Paris<br/>to-morrow, only that this good gentleman, Mr. Holmes, came round to<br/>us this evening, though how he found us is more than I can think,<br/>and he showed us very clearly and kindly that I was wrong and that<br/>Frank was right, and that we should be putting ourselves in the<br/>wrong if we were so secret. Then he offered to give us a chance of<br/>talking to Lord St. Simon alone, and so we came right away round to<br/>his rooms at once. Now, Robert, you have heard it all, and I am<br/>very sorry if I have given you pain, and I hope that you do not<br/>think very meanly of me."<br/><br/>
