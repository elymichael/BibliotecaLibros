"'It is your only chance,' said she. 'It is high, but it may be<br/>that you can jump it.'<br/><br/>"As she spoke a light sprang into view at the further end of the<br/>passage, and I saw the lean figure of Colonel Lysander Stark<br/>rushing forward with a lantern in one hand and a weapon like a<br/>butcher's cleaver in the other. I rushed across the bedroom, flung<br/>open the window, and looked out. How quiet and sweet and wholesome<br/>the garden looked in the moonlight, and it could not be more than<br/>thirty feet down. I clambered out upon the sill, but I hesitated to<br/>jump until I should have heard what passed between my saviour and<br/>the ruffian who pursued me. If she were ill-used, then at any risks<br/>I was determined to go back to her assistance. The thought had<br/>hardly flashed through my mind before he was at the door, pushing<br/>his way past her; but she threw her arms round him and tried to<br/>hold him back.<br/><br/>"'Fritz! Fritz!' she cried in English, 'remember your promise<br/>after the last time. You said it should not be again. He will be<br/>silent! Oh, he will be silent!'<br/><br/>"'You are mad, Elise!' he shouted, struggling to break away from<br/>her. 'You will be the ruin of us. He has seen too much. Let me<br/>pass, I say!' He dashed her to one side, and, rushing to the<br/>window, cut at me with his heavy weapon. I had let myself go, and<br/>was hanging by the hands to the sill, when his blow fell. I was<br/>conscious of a dull pain, my grip loosened, and I fell into the<br/>garden below.<br/><br/>"I was shaken but not hurt by the fall; so I picked myself up<br/>and rushed off among the bushes as hard as I could run, for I<br/>understood that I was far from being out of danger yet. Suddenly,<br/>however, as I ran, a deadly dizziness and sickness came over me. I<br/>glanced down at my hand, which was throbbing painfully, and then,<br/>for the first time, saw that my thumb had been cut off and that the<br/>blood was pouring from my wound. I endeavoured to tie my<br/>handkerchief round it, but there came a sudden buzzing in my ears,<br/>and next moment I fell in a dead faint among the rose-bushes.<br/><br/>"How long I remained unconscious I cannot tell. It must have<br/>been a very long time, for the moon had sunk, and a bright morning<br/>was breaking when I came to myself. My clothes were all sodden with<br/>dew, and my coat-sleeve was drenched with blood from my wounded<br/>thumb. The smarting of it recalled in an instant all the<br/>particulars of my night's adventure, and I sprang to my feet with<br/>the feeling that I might hardly yet be safe from my pursuers. But<br/>to my astonishment, when I came to look round me, neither house nor<br/>garden were to be seen. I had been lying in an angle of the hedge<br/>close by the highroad, and just a little lower down was a long<br/>building, which proved, upon my approaching it, to be the very<br/>station at which I had arrived upon the previous night. Were it not<br/>for the ugly wound upon my hand, all that had passed during those<br/>dreadful hours might have been an evil dream.<br/><br/>"Half dazed, I went into the station and asked about the morning<br/>train. There would be one to Reading in less than an hour. The same<br/>porter was on duty, I found, as had been there when I arrived. I<br/>inquired of him whether he had ever heard of Colonel Lysander<br/>Stark. The name was strange to him. Had he observed a carriage the<br/>night before waiting for me? No, he had not. Was there a<br/>police-station anywhere near? There was one about three miles<br/>off.<br/><br/>"It was too far for me to go, weak and ill as I was. I<br/>determined to wait until I got back to town before telling my story<br/>to the police. It was a little past six when I arrived, so I went<br/>first to have my wound dressed, and then the doctor was kind enough<br/>to bring me along here. I put the case into your hands and shall do<br/>exactly what you advise."<br/><br/>We both sat in silence for some little time after listening to<br/>this extraordinary narrative. Then Sherlock Holmes pulled down from<br/>the shelf one of the ponderous commonplace books in which he placed<br/>his cuttings.<br/><br/>"Here is an advertisement which will interest you," said he. "It<br/>appeared in all the papers about a year ago. Listen to this: 'Lost,<br/>on the 9th inst., Mr. Jeremiah Hayling, aged twenty-six, a<br/>hydraulic engineer. Left his lodgings at ten o'clock at night, and<br/>has not been heard of since. Was dressed in,' etc., etc. Ha! That<br/>represents the last time that the colonel needed to have his<br/>machine overhauled, I fancy."<br/><br/>"Good heavens!" cried my patient. "Then that explains what the<br/>girl said."<br/>
