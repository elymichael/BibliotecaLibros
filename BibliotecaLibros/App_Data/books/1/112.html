<br/><br/><br/>Isa Whitney, brother of the late Elias Whitney, D.D., Principal<br/>of the Theological College of St. George's, was much addicted to<br/>opium. The habit grew upon him, as I understand, from some foolish<br/>freak when he was at college; for having read De Quincey's<br/>description of his dreams and sensations, he had drenched his<br/>tobacco with laudanum in an attempt to produce the same effects. He<br/>found, as so many more have done, that the practice is easier to<br/>attain than to get rid of, and for many years he continued to be a<br/>slave to the drug, an object of mingled horror and pity to his<br/>friends and relatives. I can see him now, with yellow, pasty face,<br/>drooping lids, and pin-point pupils, all huddled in a chair, the<br/>wreck and ruin of a noble man.<br/><br/>One night—it was in June, '89—there came a ring to my bell,<br/>about the hour when a man gives his first yawn and glances at the<br/>clock. I sat up in my chair, and my wife laid her needle-work down<br/>in her lap and made a little face of disappointment.<br/><br/>"A patient!" said she. "You'll have to go out."<br/><br/>I groaned, for I was newly come back from a weary day.<br/><br/>We heard the door open, a few hurried words, and then quick<br/>steps upon the linoleum. Our own door flew open, and a lady, clad<br/>in some dark-coloured stuff, with a black veil, entered the<br/>room.<br/><br/>"You will excuse my calling so late," she began, and then,<br/>suddenly losing her self-control, she ran forward, threw her arms<br/>about my wife's neck, and sobbed upon her shoulder. "Oh, I'm in<br/>such trouble!" she cried; "I do so want a little help."<br/><br/>"Why," said my wife, pulling up her veil, "it is Kate Whitney.<br/>How you startled me, Kate! I had not an idea who you were when you<br/>came in."<br/><br/>"I didn't know what to do, so I came straight to you." That was<br/>always the way. Folk who were in grief came to my wife like birds<br/>to a light-house.<br/><br/>"It was very sweet of you to come. Now, you must have some wine<br/>and water, and sit here comfortably and tell us all about it. Or<br/>should you rather that I sent James off to bed?"<br/><br/>"Oh, no, no! I want the doctor's advice and help, too. It's<br/>about Isa. He has not been home for two days. I am so frightened<br/>about him!"<br/>
