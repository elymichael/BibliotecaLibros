Lord St. Simon sank into a chair and passed his hand over his<br/>forehead.<br/><br/>"What will the Duke say," he murmured, "when he hears that one<br/>of the family has been subjected to such humiliation?"<br/><br/>"It is the purest accident. I cannot allow that there is any<br/>humiliation."<br/><br/>"Ah, you look on these things from another standpoint."<br/><br/>"I fail to see that anyone is to blame. I can hardly see how the<br/>lady could have acted otherwise, though her abrupt method of doing<br/>it was undoubtedly to be regretted. Having no mother, she had no<br/>one to advise her at such a crisis."<br/><br/>"It was a slight, sir, a public slight," said Lord St. Simon,<br/>tapping his fingers upon the table.<br/><br/>"You must make allowance for this poor girl, placed in so<br/>unprecedented a position."<br/><br/>"I will make no allowance. I am very angry indeed, and I have<br/>been shamefully used."<br/><br/>"I think that I heard a ring," said Holmes. "Yes, there are<br/>steps on the landing. If I cannot persuade you to take a lenient<br/>view of the matter, Lord St. Simon, I have brought an advocate here<br/>who may be more successful." He opened the door and ushered in a<br/>lady and gentleman. "Lord St. Simon," said he "allow me to<br/>introduce you to Mr. and Mrs. Francis Hay Moulton. The lady, I<br/>think, you have already met."<br/><br/>At the sight of these newcomers our client had sprung from his<br/>seat and stood very erect, with his eyes cast down and his hand<br/>thrust into the breast of his frock-coat, a picture of offended<br/>dignity. The lady had taken a quick step forward and had held out<br/>her hand to him, but he still refused to raise his eyes. It was as<br/>well for his resolution, perhaps, for her pleading face was one<br/>which it was hard to resist.<br/><br/>"You're angry, Robert," said she. "Well, I guess you have every<br/>cause to be."<br/>
