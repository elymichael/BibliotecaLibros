"I could hardly imagine a more damning case," I remarked. "If<br/>ever circumstantial evidence pointed to a criminal it does so<br/>here."<br/><br/>"Circumstantial evidence is a very tricky thing," answered<br/>Holmes thoughtfully. "It may seem to point very straight to one<br/>thing, but if you shift your own point of view a little, you may<br/>find it pointing in an equally uncompromising manner to something<br/>entirely different. It must be confessed, however, that the case<br/>looks exceedingly grave against the young man, and it is very<br/>possible that he is indeed the culprit. There are several people in<br/>the neighbourhood, however, and among them Miss Turner, the<br/>daughter of the neighbouring landowner, who believe in his<br/>innocence, and who have retained Lestrade, whom you may recollect<br/>in connection with the Study in Scarlet, to work out the case in<br/>his interest. Lestrade, being rather puzzled, has referred the case<br/>to me, and hence it is that two middle-aged gentlemen are flying<br/>westward at fifty miles an hour instead of quietly digesting their<br/>breakfasts at home."<br/><br/>"I am afraid," said I, "that the facts are so obvious that you<br/>will find little credit to be gained out of this case."<br/><br/>"There is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact," he<br/>answered, laughing. "Besides, we may chance to hit upon some other<br/>obvious facts which may have been by no means obvious to Mr.<br/>Lestrade. You know me too well to think that I am boasting when I<br/>say that I shall either confirm or destroy his theory by means<br/>which he is quite incapable of employing, or even of understanding.<br/>To take the first example to hand, I very clearly perceive that in<br/>your bedroom the window is upon the right-hand side, and yet I<br/>question whether Mr. Lestrade would have noted even so self-evident<br/>a thing as that."<br/><br/>"How on earth—"<br/><br/>"My dear fellow, I know you well. I know the military neatness<br/>which characterises you. You shave every morning, and in this<br/>season you shave by the sunlight; but since your shaving is less<br/>and less complete as we get farther back on the left side, until it<br/>becomes positively slovenly as we get round the angle of the jaw,<br/>it is surely very clear that that side is less illuminated than the<br/>other. I could not imagine a man of your habits looking at himself<br/>in an equal light and being satisfied with such a result. I only<br/>quote this as a trivial example of observation and inference.<br/>Therein lies my métier, and it is just possible that it may be of<br/>some service in the investigation which lies before us. There are<br/>one or two minor points which were brought out in the inquest, and<br/>which are worth considering."<br/><br/>"What are they?"<br/><br/>"It appears that his arrest did not take place at once, but<br/>after the return to Hatherley Farm. On the inspector of<br/>constabulary informing him that he was a prisoner, he remarked that<br/>he was not surprised to hear it, and that it was no more than his<br/>deserts. This observation of his had the natural effect of removing<br/>any traces of doubt which might have remained in the minds of the<br/>coroner's jury."<br/><br/>"It was a confession," I ejaculated.<br/><br/>"No, for it was followed by a protestation of innocence."<br/><br/>"Coming on the top of such a damning series of events, it was at<br/>least a most suspicious remark."<br/>
