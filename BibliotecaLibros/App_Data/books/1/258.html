<br/>"Two days later this same performance was gone through under<br/>exactly similar circumstances. Again I changed my dress, again I<br/>sat in the window, and again I laughed very heartily at the funny<br/>stories of which my employer had an immense r√©pertoire, and which<br/>he told inimitably. Then he handed me a yellow-backed novel, and<br/>moving my chair a little sideways, that my own shadow might not<br/>fall upon the page, he begged me to read aloud to him. I read for<br/>about ten minutes, beginning in the heart of a chapter, and then<br/>suddenly, in the middle of a sentence, he ordered me to cease and<br/>to change my dress.<br/><br/>"You can easily imagine, Mr. Holmes, how curious I became as to<br/>what the meaning of this extraordinary performance could possibly<br/>be. They were always very careful, I observed, to turn my face away<br/>from the window, so that I became consumed with the desire to see<br/>what was going on behind my back. At first it seemed to be<br/>impossible, but I soon devised a means. My hand-mirror had been<br/>broken, so a happy thought seized me, and I concealed a piece of<br/>the glass in my handkerchief. On the next occasion, in the midst of<br/>my laughter, I put my handkerchief up to my eyes, and was able with<br/>a little management to see all that there was behind me. I confess<br/>that I was disappointed. There was nothing. At least that was my<br/>first impression. At the second glance, however, I perceived that<br/>there was a man standing in the Southampton Road, a small bearded<br/>man in a grey suit, who seemed to be looking in my direction. The<br/>road is an important highway, and there are usually people there.<br/>This man, however, was leaning against the railings which bordered<br/>our field and was looking earnestly up. I lowered my handkerchief<br/>and glanced at Mrs. Rucastle to find her eyes fixed upon me with a<br/>most searching gaze. She said nothing, but I am convinced that she<br/>had divined that I had a mirror in my hand and had seen what was<br/>behind me. She rose at once.<br/><br/>"'Jephro,' said she, 'there is an impertinent fellow upon the<br/>road there who stares up at Miss Hunter.'<br/><br/>"'No friend of yours, Miss Hunter?' he asked.<br/><br/>"'No, I know no one in these parts.'<br/><br/>"'Dear me! How very impertinent! Kindly turn round and motion to<br/>him to go away.'<br/><br/>"'Surely it would be better to take no notice.'<br/><br/>"'No, no, we should have him loitering here always. Kindly turn<br/>round and wave him away like that.'<br/><br/>"I did as I was told, and at the same instant Mrs. Rucastle drew<br/>down the blind. That was a week ago, and from that time I have not<br/>sat again in the window, nor have I worn the blue dress, nor seen<br/>the man in the road."<br/><br/>"Pray continue," said Holmes. "Your narrative promises to be a<br/>most interesting one."<br/><br/>
