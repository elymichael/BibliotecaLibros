<br/>"Was your sister dressed?"<br/><br/>"No, she was in her night-dress. In her right hand was found the<br/>charred stump of a match, and in her left a match-box."<br/><br/>"Showing that she had struck a light and looked about her when<br/>the alarm took place. That is important. And what conclusions did<br/>the coroner come to?"<br/><br/>"He investigated the case with great care, for Dr. Roylott's<br/>conduct had long been notorious in the county, but he was unable to<br/>find any satisfactory cause of death. My evidence showed that the<br/>door had been fastened upon the inner side, and the windows were<br/>blocked by old-fashioned shutters with broad iron bars, which were<br/>secured every night. The walls were carefully sounded, and were<br/>shown to be quite solid all round, and the flooring was also<br/>thoroughly examined, with the same result. The chimney is wide, but<br/>is barred up by four large staples. It is certain, therefore, that<br/>my sister was quite alone when she met her end. Besides, there were<br/>no marks of any violence upon her."<br/><br/>"How about poison?"<br/><br/>"The doctors examined her for it, but without success."<br/><br/>"What do you think that this unfortunate lady died of,<br/>then?"<br/><br/>"It is my belief that she died of pure fear and nervous shock,<br/>though what it was that frightened her I cannot imagine."<br/><br/>"Were there gipsies in the plantation at the time?"<br/><br/>"Yes, there are nearly always some there."<br/><br/>
