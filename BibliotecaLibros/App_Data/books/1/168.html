<br/>At Waterloo we were fortunate in catching a train for<br/>Leatherhead, where we hired a trap at the station inn and drove for<br/>four or five miles through the lovely Surrey lanes. It was a<br/>perfect day, with a bright sun and a few fleecy clouds in the<br/>heavens. The trees and wayside hedges were just throwing out their<br/>first green shoots, and the air was full of the pleasant smell of<br/>the moist earth. To me at least there was a strange contrast<br/>between the sweet promise of the spring and this sinister quest<br/>upon which we were engaged. My companion sat in the front of the<br/>trap, his arms folded, his hat pulled down over his eyes, and his<br/>chin sunk upon his breast, buried in the deepest thought. Suddenly,<br/>however, he started, tapped me on the shoulder, and pointed over<br/>the meadows.<br/><br/>"Look there!" said he.<br/><br/>A heavily timbered park stretched up in a gentle slope,<br/>thickening into a grove at the highest point. From amid the<br/>branches there jutted out the grey gables and high roof-tree of a<br/>very old mansion.<br/><br/>"Stoke Moran?" said he.<br/><br/>"Yes, sir, that be the house of Dr. Grimesby Roylott," remarked<br/>the driver.<br/><br/>"There is some building going on there," said Holmes; "that is<br/>where we are going."<br/><br/>"There's the village," said the driver, pointing to a cluster of<br/>roofs some distance to the left; "but if you want to get to the<br/>house, you'll find it shorter to get over this stile, and so by the<br/>foot-path over the fields. There it is, where the lady is<br/>walking."<br/><br/>"And the lady, I fancy, is Miss Stoner," observed Holmes,<br/>shading his eyes. "Yes, I think we had better do as you<br/>suggest."<br/><br/>We got off, paid our fare, and the trap rattled back on its way<br/>to Leatherhead.<br/><br/>"I thought it as well," said Holmes as we climbed the stile,<br/>"that this fellow should think we had come here as architects, or<br/>on some definite business. It may stop his gossip. Good-afternoon,<br/>Miss Stoner. You see that we have been as good as our word."<br/><br/>
