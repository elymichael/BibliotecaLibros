The station-master laughed heartily. "No, sir, Dr. Becher is an<br/>Englishman, and there isn't a man in the parish who has a<br/>better-lined waistcoat. But he has a gentleman staying with him, a<br/>patient, as I understand, who is a foreigner, and he looks as if a<br/>little good Berkshire beef would do him no harm."<br/><br/>The station-master had not finished his speech before we were<br/>all hastening in the direction of the fire. The road topped a low<br/>hill, and there was a great widespread whitewashed building in<br/>front of us, spouting fire at every chink and window, while in the<br/>garden in front three fire-engines were vainly striving to keep the<br/>flames under.<br/><br/>"That's it!" cried Hatherley, in intense excitement. "There is<br/>the gravel-drive, and there are the rose-bushes where I lay. That<br/>second window is the one that I jumped from."<br/><br/>"Well, at least," said Holmes, "you have had your revenge upon<br/>them. There can be no question that it was your oil-lamp which,<br/>when it was crushed in the press, set fire to the wooden walls,<br/>though no doubt they were too excited in the chase after you to<br/>observe it at the time. Now keep your eyes open in this crowd for<br/>your friends of last night, though I very much fear that they are a<br/>good hundred miles off by now."<br/><br/>And Holmes' fears came to be realised, for from that day to this<br/>no word has ever been heard either of the beautiful woman, the<br/>sinister German, or the morose Englishman. Early that morning a<br/>peasant had met a cart containing several people and some very<br/>bulky boxes driving rapidly in the direction of Reading, but there<br/>all traces of the fugitives disappeared, and even Holmes' ingenuity<br/>failed ever to discover the least clue as to their whereabouts.<br/><br/>The firemen had been much perturbed at the strange arrangements<br/>which they had found within, and still more so by discovering a<br/>newly severed human thumb upon a window-sill of the second floor.<br/>About sunset, however, their efforts were at last successful, and<br/>they subdued the flames, but not before the roof had fallen in, and<br/>the whole place been reduced to such absolute ruin that, save some<br/>twisted cylinders and iron piping, not a trace remained of the<br/>machinery which had cost our unfortunate acquaintance so dearly.<br/>Large masses of nickel and of tin were discovered stored in an<br/>out-house, but no coins were to be found, which may have explained<br/>the presence of those bulky boxes which have been already referred<br/>to.<br/><br/>How our hydraulic engineer had been conveyed from the garden to<br/>the spot where he recovered his senses might have remained forever<br/>a mystery were it not for the soft mould, which told us a very<br/>plain tale. He had evidently been carried down by two persons, one<br/>of whom had remarkably small feet and the other unusually large<br/>ones. On the whole, it was most probable that the silent<br/>Englishman, being less bold or less murderous than his companion,<br/>had assisted the woman to bear the unconscious man out of the way<br/>of danger.<br/><br/>"Well," said our engineer ruefully as we took our seats to<br/>return once more to London, "it has been a pretty business for me!<br/>I have lost my thumb and I have lost a fifty-guinea fee, and what<br/>have I gained?"<br/><br/>"Experience," said Holmes, laughing. "Indirectly it may be of<br/>value, you know; you have only to put it into words to gain the<br/>reputation of being excellent company for the remainder of your<br/>existence."<br/><br/><br/><br/>
