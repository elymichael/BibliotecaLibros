"'Where could I find him?'<br/><br/>"'Oh, at his new offices. He did tell me the address. Yes, 17<br/>King Edward Street, near St. Paul's.'<br/><br/>"I started off, Mr. Holmes, but when I got to that address it<br/>was a manufactory of artificial knee-caps, and no one in it had<br/>ever heard of either Mr. William Morris or Mr. Duncan Ross."<br/><br/>"And what did you do then?" asked Holmes.<br/><br/>"I went home to Saxe-Coburg Square, and I took the advice of my<br/>assistant. But he could not help me in any way. He could only say<br/>that if I waited I should hear by post. But that was not quite good<br/>enough, Mr. Holmes. I did not wish to lose such a place without a<br/>struggle, so, as I had heard that you were good enough to give<br/>advice to poor folk who were in need of it, I came right away to<br/>you."<br/><br/>"And you did very wisely," said Holmes. "Your case is an<br/>exceedingly remarkable one, and I shall be happy to look into it.<br/>From what you have told me I think that it is possible that graver<br/>issues hang from it than might at first sight appear."<br/><br/>"Grave enough!" said Mr. Jabez Wilson. "Why, I have lost four<br/>pound a week."<br/><br/>"As far as you are personally concerned," remarked Holmes, "I do<br/>not see that you have any grievance against this extraordinary<br/>league. On the contrary, you are, as I understand, richer by some<br/>30 pounds, to say nothing of the minute knowledge which you have<br/>gained on every subject which comes under the letter A. You have<br/>lost nothing by them."<br/><br/>"No, sir. But I want to find out about them, and who they are,<br/>and what their object was in playing this prank—if it was a<br/>prank—upon me. It was a pretty expensive joke for them, for it cost<br/>them two and thirty pounds."<br/><br/>"We shall endeavour to clear up these points for you. And,<br/>first, one or two questions, Mr. Wilson. This assistant of yours<br/>who first called your attention to the advertisement—how long had<br/>he been with you?"<br/><br/>"About a month then."<br/>
