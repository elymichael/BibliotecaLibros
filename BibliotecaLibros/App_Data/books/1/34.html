<br/><br/><br/>I had called upon my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, one day in the<br/>autumn of last year and found him in deep conversation with a very<br/>stout, florid-faced, elderly gentleman with fiery red hair. With an<br/>apology for my intrusion, I was about to withdraw when Holmes<br/>pulled me abruptly into the room and closed the door behind me.<br/><br/>"You could not possibly have come at a better time, my dear<br/>Watson," he said cordially.<br/><br/>"I was afraid that you were engaged."<br/><br/>"So I am. Very much so."<br/><br/>"Then I can wait in the next room."<br/><br/>"Not at all. This gentleman, Mr. Wilson, has been my partner and<br/>helper in many of my most successful cases, and I have no doubt<br/>that he will be of the utmost use to me in yours also."<br/><br/>The stout gentleman half rose from his chair and gave a bob of<br/>greeting, with a quick little questioning glance from his small<br/>fat-encircled eyes.<br/><br/>"Try the settee," said Holmes, relapsing into his armchair and<br/>putting his fingertips together, as was his custom when in judicial<br/>moods. "I know, my dear Watson, that you share my love of all that<br/>is bizarre and outside the conventions and humdrum routine of<br/>everyday life. You have shown your relish for it by the enthusiasm<br/>which has prompted you to chronicle, and, if you will excuse my<br/>saying so, somewhat to embellish so many of my own little<br/>adventures."<br/><br/>"Your cases have indeed been of the greatest interest to me," I<br/>observed.<br/><br/>"You will remember that I remarked the other day, just before we<br/>went into the very simple problem presented by Miss Mary<br/>Sutherland, that for strange effects and extraordinary combinations<br/>we must go to life itself, which is always far more daring than any<br/>effort of the imagination."<br/>
