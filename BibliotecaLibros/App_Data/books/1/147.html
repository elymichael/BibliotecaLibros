"Oh, it is a matter of no importance; but I don't know why you<br/>should be so warm over such a trifle."<br/><br/>"Warm! You'd be as warm, maybe, if you were as pestered as I am.<br/>When I pay good money for a good article there should be an end of<br/>the business; but it's 'Where are the geese?' and 'Who did you sell<br/>the geese to?' and 'What will you take for the geese?' One would<br/>think they were the only geese in the world, to hear the fuss that<br/>is made over them."<br/><br/>"Well, I have no connection with any other people who have been<br/>making inquiries," said Holmes carelessly. "If you won't tell us<br/>the bet is off, that is all. But I'm always ready to back my<br/>opinion on a matter of fowls, and I have a fiver on it that the<br/>bird I ate is country bred."<br/><br/>"Well, then, you've lost your fiver, for it's town bred,"<br/>snapped the salesman.<br/><br/>"It's nothing of the kind."<br/><br/>"I say it is."<br/><br/>"I don't believe it."<br/><br/>"D'you think you know more about fowls than I, who have handled<br/>them ever since I was a nipper? I tell you, all those birds that<br/>went to the Alpha were town bred."<br/><br/>"You'll never persuade me to believe that."<br/><br/>"Will you bet, then?"<br/><br/>"It's merely taking your money, for I know that I am right. But<br/>I'll have a sovereign on with you, just to teach you not to be<br/>obstinate."<br/>
