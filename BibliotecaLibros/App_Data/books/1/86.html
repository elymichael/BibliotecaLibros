<br/>"Look here, Watson," he said when the cloth was cleared "just<br/>sit down in this chair and let me preach to you for a little. I<br/>don't know quite what to do, and I should value your advice. Light<br/>a cigar and let me expound."<br/><br/>"Pray do so."<br/><br/>"Well, now, in considering this case there are two points about<br/>young McCarthy's narrative which struck us both instantly, although<br/>they impressed me in his favour and you against him. One was the<br/>fact that his father should, according to his account, cry 'Cooee!'<br/>before seeing him. The other was his singular dying reference to a<br/>rat. He mumbled several words, you understand, but that was all<br/>that caught the son's ear. Now from this double point our research<br/>must commence, and we will begin it by presuming that what the lad<br/>says is absolutely true."<br/><br/>"What of this 'Cooee!' then?"<br/><br/>"Well, obviously it could not have been meant for the son. The<br/>son, as far as he knew, was in Bristol. It was mere chance that he<br/>was within earshot. The 'Cooee!' was meant to attract the attention<br/>of whoever it was that he had the appointment with. But 'Cooee' is<br/>a distinctly Australian cry, and one which is used between<br/>Australians. There is a strong presumption that the person whom<br/>McCarthy expected to meet him at Boscombe Pool was someone who had<br/>been in Australia."<br/><br/>"What of the rat, then?"<br/><br/>Sherlock Holmes took a folded paper from his pocket and<br/>flattened it out on the table. "This is a map of the Colony of<br/>Victoria," he said. "I wired to Bristol for it last night." He put<br/>his hand over part of the map. "What do you read?"<br/><br/>"ARAT," I read.<br/><br/>"And now?" He raised his hand.<br/><br/>"BALLARAT."<br/><br/>
