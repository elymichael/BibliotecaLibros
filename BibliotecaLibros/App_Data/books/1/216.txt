"Then perhaps you will kindly explain how it is that we found
this in it?" He opened his bag as he spoke, and tumbled onto the
floor a wedding-dress of watered silk, a pair of white satin shoes
and a bride's wreath and veil, all discoloured and soaked in water.
"There," said he, putting a new wedding-ring upon the top of the
pile. "There is a little nut for you to crack, Master Holmes."

"Oh, indeed!" said my friend, blowing blue rings into the air.
"You dragged them from the Serpentine?"

"No. They were found floating near the margin by a park-keeper.
They have been identified as her clothes, and it seemed to me that
if the clothes were there the body would not be far off."

"By the same brilliant reasoning, every man's body is to be
found in the neighbourhood of his wardrobe. And pray what did you
hope to arrive at through this?"

"At some evidence implicating Flora Millar in the
disappearance."

"I am afraid that you will find it difficult."

"Are you, indeed, now?" cried Lestrade with some bitterness. "I
am afraid, Holmes, that you are not very practical with your
deductions and your inferences. You have made two blunders in as
many minutes. This dress does implicate Miss Flora Millar."

"And how?"

"In the dress is a pocket. In the pocket is a card-case. In the
card-case is a note. And here is the very note." He slapped it down
upon the table in front of him. "Listen to this: 'You will see me
when all is ready. Come at once. F.H.M.' Now my theory all along
has been that Lady St. Simon was decoyed away by Flora Millar, and
that she, with confederates, no doubt, was responsible for her
disappearance. Here, signed with her initials, is the very note
which was no doubt quietly slipped into her hand at the door and
which lured her within their reach."

"Very good, Lestrade," said Holmes, laughing. "You really are
very fine indeed. Let me see it." He took up the paper in a
listless way, but his attention instantly became riveted, and he
gave a little cry of satisfaction. "This is indeed important," said
he.
