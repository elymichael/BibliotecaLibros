If you show us what is wrong we shall soon set<br/>it right ourselves. What do you think of such a commission as<br/>that?'<br/><br/>"'The work appears to be light and the pay munificent.'<br/><br/>"'Precisely so. We shall want you to come to-night by the last<br/>train.'<br/><br/>"'Where to?'<br/><br/>"'To Eyford, in Berkshire. It is a little place near the borders<br/>of Oxfordshire, and within seven miles of Reading. There is a train<br/>from Paddington which would bring you there at about 11:15.'<br/><br/>"'Very good.'<br/><br/>"'I shall come down in a carriage to meet you.'<br/><br/>"'There is a drive, then?'<br/><br/>"'Yes, our little place is quite out in the country. It is a<br/>good seven miles from Eyford Station.'<br/><br/>"'Then we can hardly get there before midnight. I suppose there<br/>would be no chance of a train back. I should be compelled to stop<br/>the night.'<br/>
