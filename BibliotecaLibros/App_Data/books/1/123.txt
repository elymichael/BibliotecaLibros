"'Dearest do not be frightened. All will come well. There is a
huge error which it may take some little time to rectify. Wait in

octavo size, no water-mark. Hum! Posted to-day in Gravesend by a
man with a dirty thumb. Ha! And the flap has been gummed, if I am

And you have no doubt that it is your husband's hand, madam?"

"None. Neville wrote those words."

"And they were posted to-day at Gravesend. Well, Mrs. St. Clair,
the clouds lighten, though I should not venture to say that the
danger is over."

"But he must be alive, Mr. Holmes."

"Unless this is a clever forgery to put us on the wrong scent.

him."

"No, no; it is, it is his very own writing!"
