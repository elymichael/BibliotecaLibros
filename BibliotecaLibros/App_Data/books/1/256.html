<br/>"You horrify me!"<br/><br/>"But the reason is very obvious. The pressure of public opinion<br/>can do in the town what the law cannot accomplish. There is no lane<br/>so vile that the scream of a tortured child, or the thud of a<br/>drunkard's blow, does not beget sympathy and indignation among the<br/>neighbours, and then the whole machinery of justice is ever so<br/>close that a word of complaint can set it going, and there is but a<br/>step between the crime and the dock. But look at these lonely<br/>houses, each in its own fields, filled for the most part with poor<br/>ignorant folk who know little of the law. Think of the deeds of<br/>hellish cruelty, the hidden wickedness which may go on, year in,<br/>year out, in such places, and none the wiser. Had this lady who<br/>appeals to us for help gone to live in Winchester, I should never<br/>have had a fear for her. It is the five miles of country which<br/>makes the danger. Still, it is clear that she is not personally<br/>threatened."<br/><br/>"No. If she can come to Winchester to meet us she can get<br/>away."<br/><br/>"Quite so. She has her freedom."<br/><br/>"What CAN be the matter, then? Can you suggest no<br/>explanation?"<br/><br/>"I have devised seven separate explanations, each of which would<br/>cover the facts as far as we know them. But which of these is<br/>correct can only be determined by the fresh information which we<br/>shall no doubt find waiting for us. Well, there is the tower of the<br/>cathedral, and we shall soon learn all that Miss Hunter has to<br/>tell."<br/><br/>The Black Swan is an inn of repute in the High Street, at no<br/>distance from the station, and there we found the young lady<br/>waiting for us. She had engaged a sitting-room, and our lunch<br/>awaited us upon the table.<br/><br/>"I am so delighted that you have come," she said earnestly. "It<br/>is so very kind of you both; but indeed I do not know what I should<br/>do. Your advice will be altogether invaluable to me."<br/><br/>"Pray tell us what has happened to you."<br/><br/>"I will do so, and I must be quick, for I have promised Mr.<br/>Rucastle to be back before three. I got his leave to come into town<br/>this morning, though he little knew for what purpose."<br/><br/>
