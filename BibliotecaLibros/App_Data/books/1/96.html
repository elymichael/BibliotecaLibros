<br/>"You fill me with interest," said Holmes. "Pray give us the<br/>essential facts from the commencement, and I can afterwards<br/>question you as to those details which seem to me to be most<br/>important."<br/><br/>The young man pulled his chair up and pushed his wet feet out<br/>towards the blaze.<br/><br/>"My name," said he, "is John Openshaw, but my own affairs have,<br/>as far as I can understand, little to do with this awful business.<br/>It is a hereditary matter; so in order to give you an idea of the<br/>facts, I must go back to the commencement of the affair.<br/><br/>"You must know that my grandfather had two sons—my uncle Elias<br/>and my father Joseph. My father had a small factory at Coventry,<br/>which he enlarged at the time of the invention of bicycling. He was<br/>a patentee of the Openshaw unbreakable tire, and his business met<br/>with such success that he was able to sell it and to retire upon a<br/>handsome competence.<br/><br/>"My uncle Elias emigrated to America when he was a young man and<br/>became a planter in Florida, where he was reported to have done<br/>very well. At the time of the war he fought in Jackson's army, and<br/>afterwards under Hood, where he rose to be a colonel. When Lee laid<br/>down his arms my uncle returned to his plantation, where he<br/>remained for three or four years. About 1869 or 1870 he came back<br/>to Europe and took a small estate in Sussex, near Horsham. He had<br/>made a very considerable fortune in the States, and his reason for<br/>leaving them was his aversion to the negroes, and his dislike of<br/>the Republican policy in extending the franchise to them. He was a<br/>singular man, fierce and quick-tempered, very foul-mouthed when he<br/>was angry, and of a most retiring disposition. During all the years<br/>that he lived at Horsham, I doubt if ever he set foot in the town.<br/>He had a garden and two or three fields round his house, and there<br/>he would take his exercise, though very often for weeks on end he<br/>would never leave his room. He drank a great deal of brandy and<br/>smoked very heavily, but he would see no society and did not want<br/>any friends, not even his own brother.<br/><br/>"He didn't mind me; in fact, he took a fancy to me, for at the<br/>time when he saw me first I was a youngster of twelve or so. This<br/>would be in the year 1878, after he had been eight or nine years in<br/>England. He begged my father to let me live with him and he was<br/>very kind to me in his way. When he was sober he used to be fond of<br/>playing backgammon and draughts with me, and he would make me his<br/>representative both with the servants and with the tradespeople, so<br/>that by the time that I was sixteen I was quite master of the<br/>house. I kept all the keys and could go where I liked and do what I<br/>liked, so long as I did not disturb him in his privacy. There was<br/>one singular exception, however, for he had a single room, a<br/>lumber-room up among the attics, which was invariably locked, and<br/>which he would never permit either me or anyone else to enter. With<br/>a boy's curiosity I have peeped through the keyhole, but I was<br/>never able to see more than such a collection of old trunks and<br/>bundles as would be expected in such a room.<br/><br/>"One day—it was in March, 1883—a letter with a foreign stamp lay<br/>upon the table in front of the colonel's plate. It was not a common<br/>thing for him to receive letters, for his bills were all paid in<br/>ready money, and he had no friends of any sort. 'From India!' said<br/>he as he took it up, 'Pondicherry postmark! What can this be?'<br/>Opening it hurriedly, out there jumped five little dried orange<br/>pips, which pattered down upon his plate. I began to laugh at this,<br/>but the laugh was struck from my lips at the sight of his face. His<br/>lip had fallen, his eyes were protruding, his skin the colour of<br/>putty, and he glared at the envelope which he still held in his<br/>trembling hand, 'K. K. K.!' he shrieked, and then, 'My God, my God,<br/>my sins have overtaken me!'<br/><br/>"'What is it, uncle?' I cried.<br/><br/>"'Death,' said he, and rising from the table he retired to his<br/>room, leaving me palpitating with horror. I took up the envelope<br/>and saw scrawled in red ink upon the inner flap, just above the<br/>gum, the letter K three times repeated. There was nothing else save<br/>the five dried pips. What could be the reason of his overpowering<br/>terror? I left the breakfast-table, and as I ascended the stair I<br/>met him coming down with an old rusty key, which must have belonged<br/>to the attic, in one hand, and a small brass box, like a cashbox,<br/>in the other.<br/><br/>"'They may do what they like, but I'll checkmate them still,'<br/>said he with an oath. 'Tell Mary that I shall want a fire in my<br/>room to-day, and send down to Fordham, the Horsham lawyer.'<br/><br/>
