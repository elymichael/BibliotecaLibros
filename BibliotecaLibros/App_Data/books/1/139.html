"This hat has not been brushed for weeks. When I see you, my<br/>dear Watson, with a week's accumulation of dust upon your hat, and<br/>when your wife allows you to go out in such a state, I shall fear<br/>that you also have been unfortunate enough to lose your wife's<br/>affection."<br/><br/>"But he might be a bachelor."<br/><br/>"Nay, he was bringing home the goose as a peace-offering to his<br/>wife. Remember the card upon the bird's leg."<br/><br/>"You have an answer to everything. But how on earth do you<br/>deduce that the gas is not laid on in his house?"<br/><br/>"One tallow stain, or even two, might come by chance; but when I<br/>see no less than five, I think that there can be little doubt that<br/>the individual must be brought into frequent contact with burning<br/>tallowâ€”walks upstairs at night probably with his hat in one hand<br/>and a guttering candle in the other. Anyhow, he never got<br/>tallow-stains from a gas-jet. Are you satisfied?"<br/><br/>"Well, it is very ingenious," said I, laughing; "but since, as<br/>you said just now, there has been no crime committed, and no harm<br/>done save the loss of a goose, all this seems to be rather a waste<br/>of energy."<br/><br/>Sherlock Holmes had opened his mouth to reply, when the door<br/>flew open, and Peterson, the commissionaire, rushed into the<br/>apartment with flushed cheeks and the face of a man who is dazed<br/>with astonishment.<br/><br/>"The goose, Mr. Holmes! The goose, sir!" he gasped.<br/><br/>"Eh? What of it, then? Has it returned to life and flapped off<br/>through the kitchen window?" Holmes twisted himself round upon the<br/>sofa to get a fairer view of the man's excited face.<br/><br/>"See here, sir! See what my wife found in its crop!" He held out<br/>his hand and displayed upon the centre of the palm a brilliantly<br/>scintillating blue stone, rather smaller than a bean in size, but<br/>of such purity and radiance that it twinkled like an electric point<br/>in the dark hollow of his hand.<br/><br/>Sherlock Holmes sat up with a whistle. "By Jove, Peterson!" said<br/>he, "this is treasure trove indeed. I suppose you know what you<br/>have got?"<br/>
