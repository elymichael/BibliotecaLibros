"I think that this should do," said he, glancing into the glass<br/>above the fireplace. "I only wish that you could come with me,<br/>Watson, but I fear that it won't do. I may be on the trail in this<br/>matter, or I may be following a will-o'-the-wisp, but I shall soon<br/>know which it is. I hope that I may be back in a few hours." He cut<br/>a slice of beef from the joint upon the sideboard, sandwiched it<br/>between two rounds of bread, and thrusting this rude meal into his<br/>pocket he started off upon his expedition.<br/><br/>I had just finished my tea when he returned, evidently in<br/>excellent spirits, swinging an old elastic-sided boot in his hand.<br/>He chucked it down into a corner and helped himself to a cup of<br/>tea.<br/><br/>"I only looked in as I passed," said he. "I am going right<br/>on."<br/><br/>"Where to?"<br/><br/>"Oh, to the other side of the West End. It may be some time<br/>before I get back. Don't wait up for me in case I should be<br/>late."<br/><br/>"How are you getting on?"<br/><br/>"Oh, so so. Nothing to complain of. I have been out to Streatham<br/>since I saw you last, but I did not call at the house. It is a very<br/>sweet little problem, and I would not have missed it for a good<br/>deal. However, I must not sit gossiping here, but must get these<br/>disreputable clothes off and return to my highly respectable<br/>self."<br/><br/>I could see by his manner that he had stronger reasons for<br/>satisfaction than his words alone would imply. His eyes twinkled,<br/>and there was even a touch of colour upon his sallow cheeks. He<br/>hastened upstairs, and a few minutes later I heard the slam of the<br/>hall door, which told me that he was off once more upon his<br/>congenial hunt.<br/><br/>I waited until midnight, but there was no sign of his return, so<br/>I retired to my room. It was no uncommon thing for him to be away<br/>for days and nights on end when he was hot upon a scent, so that<br/>his lateness caused me no surprise. I do not know at what hour he<br/>came in, but when I came down to breakfast in the morning there he<br/>was with a cup of coffee in one hand and the paper in the other, as<br/>fresh and trim as possible.<br/><br/>"You will excuse my beginning without you, Watson," said he,<br/>"but you remember that our client has rather an early appointment<br/>this morning."<br/><br/>"Why, it is after nine now," I answered. "I should not be<br/>surprised if that were he. I thought I heard a ring."<br/>
