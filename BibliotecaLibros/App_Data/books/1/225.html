<br/>"No doubt you think me mad?" said he.<br/><br/>"I see that you have had some great trouble," responded<br/>Holmes.<br/><br/>"God knows I have!—a trouble which is enough to unseat my<br/>reason, so sudden and so terrible is it. Public disgrace I might<br/>have faced, although I am a man whose character has never yet borne<br/>a stain. Private affliction also is the lot of every man; but the<br/>two coming together, and in so frightful a form, have been enough<br/>to shake my very soul. Besides, it is not I alone. The very noblest<br/>in the land may suffer unless some way be found out of this<br/>horrible affair."<br/><br/>"Pray compose yourself, sir," said Holmes, "and let me have a<br/>clear account of who you are and what it is that has befallen<br/>you."<br/><br/>"My name," answered our visitor, "is probably familiar to your<br/>ears. I am Alexander Holder, of the banking firm of Holder &amp;<br/>Stevenson, of Threadneedle Street."<br/><br/>The name was indeed well known to us as belonging to the senior<br/>partner in the second largest private banking concern in the City<br/>of London. What could have happened, then, to bring one of the<br/>foremost citizens of London to this most pitiable pass? We waited,<br/>all curiosity, until with another effort he braced himself to tell<br/>his story.<br/><br/>"I feel that time is of value," said he; "that is why I hastened<br/>here when the police inspector suggested that I should secure your<br/>co-operation. I came to Baker Street by the Underground and hurried<br/>from there on foot, for the cabs go slowly through this snow. That<br/>is why I was so out of breath, for I am a man who takes very little<br/>exercise. I feel better now, and I will put the facts before you as<br/>shortly and yet as clearly as I can.<br/><br/>"It is, of course, well known to you that in a successful<br/>banking business as much depends upon our being able to find<br/>remunerative investments for our funds as upon our increasing our<br/>connection and the number of our depositors. One of our most<br/>lucrative means of laying out money is in the shape of loans, where<br/>the security is unimpeachable. We have done a good deal in this<br/>direction during the last few years, and there are many noble<br/>families to whom we have advanced large sums upon the security of<br/>their pictures, libraries, or plate.<br/><br/>"Yesterday morning I was seated in my office at the bank when a<br/>card was brought in to me by one of the clerks. I started when I<br/>saw the name, for it was that of none other than—well, perhaps even<br/>to you I had better say no more than that it was a name which is a<br/>household word all over the earth—one of the highest, noblest, most<br/>exalted names in England. I was overwhelmed by the honour and<br/>attempted, when he entered, to say so, but he plunged at once into<br/>business with the air of a man who wishes to hurry quickly through<br/>a disagreeable task.<br/><br/>"'Mr. Holder,' said he, 'I have been informed that you are in<br/>the habit of advancing money.'<br/><br/>
