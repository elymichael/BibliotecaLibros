<br/>"Mr. Hosmer Angel came to the house again and proposed that we<br/>should marry before father came back. He was in dreadful earnest<br/>and made me swear, with my hands on the Testament, that whatever<br/>happened I would always be true to him. Mother said he was quite<br/>right to make me swear, and that it was a sign of his passion.<br/>Mother was all in his favour from the first and was even fonder of<br/>him than I was. Then, when they talked of marrying within the week,<br/>I began to ask about father; but they both said never to mind about<br/>father, but just to tell him afterwards, and mother said she would<br/>make it all right with him. I didn't quite like that, Mr. Holmes.<br/>It seemed funny that I should ask his leave, as he was only a few<br/>years older than me; but I didn't want to do anything on the sly,<br/>so I wrote to father at Bordeaux, where the company has its French<br/>offices, but the letter came back to me on the very morning of the<br/>wedding."<br/><br/>"It missed him, then?"<br/><br/>"Yes, sir; for he had started to England just before it<br/>arrived."<br/><br/>"Ha! that was unfortunate. Your wedding was arranged, then, for<br/>the Friday. Was it to be in church?"<br/><br/>"Yes, sir, but very quietly. It was to be at St. Saviour's, near<br/>King's Cross, and we were to have breakfast afterwards at the St.<br/>Pancras Hotel. Hosmer came for us in a hansom, but as there were<br/>two of us he put us both into it and stepped himself into a<br/>four-wheeler, which happened to be the only other cab in the<br/>street. We got to the church first, and when the four-wheeler drove<br/>up we waited for him to step out, but he never did, and when the<br/>cabman got down from the box and looked there was no one there! The<br/>cabman said that he could not imagine what had become of him, for<br/>he had seen him get in with his own eyes. That was last Friday, Mr.<br/>Holmes, and I have never seen or heard anything since then to throw<br/>any light upon what became of him."<br/><br/>"It seems to me that you have been very shamefully treated,"<br/>said Holmes.<br/><br/>"Oh, no, sir! He was too good and kind to leave me so. Why, all<br/>the morning he was saying to me that, whatever happened, I was to<br/>be true; and that even if something quite unforeseen occurred to<br/>separate us, I was always to remember that I was pledged to him,<br/>and that he would claim his pledge sooner or later. It seemed<br/>strange talk for a wedding-morning, but what has happened since<br/>gives a meaning to it."<br/><br/>"Most certainly it does. Your own opinion is, then, that some<br/>unforeseen catastrophe has occurred to him?"<br/><br/>"Yes, sir. I believe that he foresaw some danger, or else he<br/>would not have talked so. And then I think that what he foresaw<br/>happened."<br/><br/>"But you have no notion as to what it could have been?"<br/><br/>
