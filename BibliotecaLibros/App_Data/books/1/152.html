<br/>Our visitor staggered to his feet and clutched the mantelpiece<br/>with his right hand. Holmes unlocked his strong-box and held up the<br/>blue carbuncle, which shone out like a star, with a cold,<br/>brilliant, many-pointed radiance. Ryder stood glaring with a drawn<br/>face, uncertain whether to claim or to disown it.<br/><br/>"The game's up, Ryder," said Holmes quietly. "Hold up, man, or<br/>you'll be into the fire! Give him an arm back into his chair,<br/>Watson. He's not got blood enough to go in for felony with<br/>impunity. Give him a dash of brandy. So! Now he looks a little more<br/>human. What a shrimp it is, to be sure!"<br/><br/>For a moment he had staggered and nearly fallen, but the brandy<br/>brought a tinge of colour into his cheeks, and he sat staring with<br/>frightened eyes at his accuser.<br/><br/>"I have almost every link in my hands, and all the proofs which<br/>I could possibly need, so there is little which you need tell me.<br/>Still, that little may as well be cleared up to make the case<br/>complete. You had heard, Ryder, of this blue stone of the Countess<br/>of Morcar's?"<br/><br/>"It was Catherine Cusack who told me of it," said he in a<br/>crackling voice.<br/><br/>"I see—her ladyship's waiting-maid. Well, the temptation of<br/>sudden wealth so easily acquired was too much for you, as it has<br/>been for better men before you; but you were not very scrupulous in<br/>the means you used. It seems to me, Ryder, that there is the making<br/>of a very pretty villain in you. You knew that this man Horner, the<br/>plumber, had been concerned in some such matter before, and that<br/>suspicion would rest the more readily upon him. What did you do,<br/>then? You made some small job in my lady's room—you and your<br/>confederate Cusack—and you managed that he should be the man sent<br/>for. Then, when he had left, you rifled the jewel-case, raised the<br/>alarm, and had this unfortunate man arrested. You then—"<br/><br/>Ryder threw himself down suddenly upon the rug and clutched at<br/>my companion's knees. "For God's sake, have mercy!" he shrieked.<br/>"Think of my father! Of my mother! It would break their hearts. I<br/>never went wrong before! I never will again. I swear it. I'll swear<br/>it on a Bible. Oh, don't bring it into court! For Christ's sake,<br/>don't!"<br/><br/>"Get back into your chair!" said Holmes sternly. "It is very<br/>well to cringe and crawl now, but you thought little enough of this<br/>poor Horner in the dock for a crime of which he knew nothing."<br/><br/>"I will fly, Mr. Holmes. I will leave the country, sir. Then the<br/>charge against him will break down."<br/><br/>"Hum! We will talk about that. And now let us hear a true<br/>account of the next act. How came the stone into the goose, and how<br/>came the goose into the open market? Tell us the truth, for there<br/>lies your only hope of safety."<br/><br/>
