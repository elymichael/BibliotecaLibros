"'Certainly,' I answered.<br/><br/>"'Then, good-bye, Mr. Jabez Wilson, and let me congratulate you<br/>once more on the important position which you have been fortunate<br/>enough to gain.' He bowed me out of the room and I went home with<br/>my assistant, hardly knowing what to say or do, I was so pleased at<br/>my own good fortune.<br/><br/>"Well, I thought over the matter all day, and by evening I was<br/>in low spirits again; for I had quite persuaded myself that the<br/>whole affair must be some great hoax or fraud, though what its<br/>object might be I could not imagine. It seemed altogether past<br/>belief that anyone could make such a will, or that they would pay<br/>such a sum for doing anything so simple as copying out the<br/>'Encyclopaedia Britannica.' Vincent Spaulding did what he could to<br/>cheer me up, but by bedtime I had reasoned myself out of the whole<br/>thing. However, in the morning I determined to have a look at it<br/>anyhow, so I bought a penny bottle of ink, and with a quill-pen,<br/>and seven sheets of foolscap paper, I started off for Pope's<br/>Court.<br/><br/>"Well, to my surprise and delight, everything was as right as<br/>possible. The table was set out ready for me, and Mr. Duncan Ross<br/>was there to see that I got fairly to work. He started me off upon<br/>the letter A, and then he left me; but he would drop in from time<br/>to time to see that all was right with me. At two o'clock he bade<br/>me good-day, complimented me upon the amount that I had written,<br/>and locked the door of the office after me.<br/><br/>"This went on day after day, Mr. Holmes, and on Saturday the<br/>manager came in and planked down four golden sovereigns for my<br/>week's work. It was the same next week, and the same the week<br/>after. Every morning I was there at ten, and every afternoon I left<br/>at two. By degrees Mr. Duncan Ross took to coming in only once of a<br/>morning, and then, after a time, he did not come in at all. Still,<br/>of course, I never dared to leave the room for an instant, for I<br/>was not sure when he might come, and the billet was such a good<br/>one, and suited me so well, that I would not risk the loss of<br/>it.<br/><br/>"Eight weeks passed away like this, and I had written about<br/>Abbots and Archery and Armour and Architecture and Attica, and<br/>hoped with diligence that I might get on to the B's before very<br/>long. It cost me something in foolscap, and I had pretty nearly<br/>filled a shelf with my writings. And then suddenly the whole<br/>business came to an end."<br/><br/>"To an end?"<br/><br/>"Yes, sir. And no later than this morning. I went to my work as<br/>usual at ten o'clock, but the door was shut and locked, with a<br/>little square of cardboard hammered on to the middle of the panel<br/>with a tack. Here it is, and you can read for yourself."<br/><br/>He held up a piece of white cardboard about the size of a sheet<br/>of note-paper. It read in this fashion:<br/><br/>THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE<br/><br/>IS<br/>
