"Your father," said Holmes, "your stepfather, surely, since the<br/>name is different."<br/><br/>"Yes, my stepfather. I call him father, though it sounds funny,<br/>too, for he is only five years and two months older than<br/>myself."<br/><br/>"And your mother is alive?"<br/><br/>"Oh, yes, mother is alive and well. I wasn't best pleased, Mr.<br/>Holmes, when she married again so soon after father's death, and a<br/>man who was nearly fifteen years younger than herself. Father was a<br/>plumber in the Tottenham Court Road, and he left a tidy business<br/>behind him, which mother carried on with Mr. Hardy, the foreman;<br/>but when Mr. Windibank came he made her sell the business, for he<br/>was very superior, being a traveller in wines. They got 4700 pounds<br/>for the goodwill and interest, which wasn't near as much as father<br/>could have got if he had been alive."<br/><br/>I had expected to see Sherlock Holmes impatient under this<br/>rambling and inconsequential narrative, but, on the contrary, he<br/>had listened with the greatest concentration of attention.<br/><br/>"Your own little income," he asked, "does it come out of the<br/>business?"<br/><br/>"Oh, no, sir. It is quite separate and was left me by my uncle<br/>Ned in Auckland. It is in New Zealand stock, paying 4 1/2 per cent.<br/>Two thousand five hundred pounds was the amount, but I can only<br/>touch the interest."<br/><br/>"You interest me extremely," said Holmes. "And since you draw so<br/>large a sum as a hundred a year, with what you earn into the<br/>bargain, you no doubt travel a little and indulge yourself in every<br/>way. I believe that a single lady can get on very nicely upon an<br/>income of about 60 pounds."<br/><br/>"I could do with much less than that, Mr. Holmes, but you<br/>understand that as long as I live at home I don't wish to be a<br/>burden to them, and so they have the use of the money just while I<br/>am staying with them. Of course, that is only just for the time.<br/>Mr. Windibank draws my interest every quarter and pays it over to<br/>mother, and I find that I can do pretty well with what I earn at<br/>typewriting. It brings me twopence a sheet, and I can often do from<br/>fifteen to twenty sheets in a day."<br/><br/>"You have made your position very clear to me," said Holmes.<br/>"This is my friend, Dr. Watson, before whom you can speak as freely<br/>as before myself. Kindly tell us now all about your connection with<br/>Mr. Hosmer Angel."<br/><br/>A flush stole over Miss Sutherland's face, and she picked<br/>nervously at the fringe of her jacket. "I met him first at the<br/>gasfitters' ball," she said. "They used to send father tickets when<br/>he was alive, and then afterwards they remembered us, and sent them<br/>to mother. Mr. Windibank did not wish us to go. He never did wish<br/>us to go anywhere. He would get quite mad if I wanted so much as to<br/>join a Sunday-school treat. But this time I was set on going, and I<br/>would go; for what right had he to prevent? He said the folk were<br/>not fit for us to know, when all father's friends were to be there.<br/>And he said that I had nothing fit to wear, when I had my purple<br/>plush that I had never so much as taken out of the drawer. At last,<br/>when nothing else would do, he went off to France upon the business<br/>of the firm, but we went, mother and I, with Mr. Hardy, who used to<br/>be our foreman, and it was there I met Mr. Hosmer Angel."<br/>
