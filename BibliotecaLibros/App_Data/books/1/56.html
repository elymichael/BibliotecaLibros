<br/><br/><br/>"My dear fellow," said Sherlock Holmes as we sat on either side<br/>of the fire in his lodgings at Baker Street, "life is infinitely<br/>stranger than anything which the mind of man could invent. We would<br/>not dare to conceive the things which are really mere commonplaces<br/>of existence. If we could fly out of that window hand in hand,<br/>hover over this great city, gently remove the roofs, and peep in at<br/>the queer things which are going on, the strange coincidences, the<br/>plannings, the cross-purposes, the wonderful chains of events,<br/>working through generations, and leading to the most outré results,<br/>it would make all fiction with its conventionalities and foreseen<br/>conclusions most stale and unprofitable."<br/><br/>"And yet I am not convinced of it," I answered. "The cases which<br/>come to light in the papers are, as a rule, bald enough, and vulgar<br/>enough. We have in our police reports realism pushed to its extreme<br/>limits, and yet the result is, it must be confessed, neither<br/>fascinating nor artistic."<br/><br/>"A certain selection and discretion must be used in producing a<br/>realistic effect," remarked Holmes. "This is wanting in the police<br/>report, where more stress is laid, perhaps, upon the platitudes of<br/>the magistrate than upon the details, which to an observer contain<br/>the vital essence of the whole matter. Depend upon it, there is<br/>nothing so unnatural as the commonplace."<br/><br/>I smiled and shook my head. "I can quite understand your<br/>thinking so." I said. "Of course, in your position of unofficial<br/>adviser and helper to everybody who is absolutely puzzled,<br/>throughout three continents, you are brought in contact with all<br/>that is strange and bizarre. But here"—I picked up the morning<br/>paper from the ground—"let us put it to a practical test. Here is<br/>the first heading upon which I come. 'A husband's cruelty to his<br/>wife.' There is half a column of print, but I know without reading<br/>it that it is all perfectly familiar to me. There is, of course,<br/>the other woman, the drink, the push, the blow, the bruise, the<br/>sympathetic sister or landlady. The crudest of writers could invent<br/>nothing more crude."<br/><br/>"Indeed, your example is an unfortunate one for your argument,"<br/>said Holmes, taking the paper and glancing his eye down it. "This<br/>is the Dundas separation case, and, as it happens, I was engaged in<br/>clearing up some small points in connection with it. The husband<br/>was a teetotaler, there was no other woman, and the conduct<br/>complained of was that he had drifted into the habit of winding up<br/>every meal by taking out his false teeth and hurling them at his<br/>wife, which, you will allow, is not an action likely to occur to<br/>the imagination of the average story-teller. Take a pinch of snuff,<br/>Doctor, and acknowledge that I have scored over you in your<br/>example."<br/><br/>He held out his snuffbox of old gold, with a great amethyst in<br/>the centre of the lid. Its splendour was in such contrast to his<br/>homely ways and simple life that I could not help commenting upon<br/>it.<br/><br/>"Ah," said he, "I forgot that I had not seen you for some weeks.<br/>It is a little souvenir from the King of Bohemia in return for my<br/>assistance in the case of the Irene Adler papers."<br/><br/>"And the ring?" I asked, glancing at a remarkable brilliant<br/>which sparkled upon his finger.<br/><br/>"It was from the reigning family of Holland, though the matter<br/>in which I served them was of such delicacy that I cannot confide<br/>it even to you, who have been good enough to chronicle one or two<br/>of my little problems."<br/><br/>"And have you any on hand just now?" I asked with interest.<br/>
