<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>19<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>"There is no use your telling me that you are going to be good,"<br/>cried Lord Henry, dipping his white fingers into a red copper bowl<br/>filled with rose-water. "You are quite perfect. Pray, don't<br/>change."<br/><br/>Dorian Gray shook his head. "No, Harry, I have done too many<br/>dreadful things in my life. I am not going to do any more. I began<br/>my good actions yesterday."<br/><br/>"Where were you yesterday?"<br/><br/>"In the country, Harry. I was staying at a little inn by<br/>myself."<br/><br/>"My dear boy," said Lord Henry, smiling, "anybody can be good in<br/>the country. There are no temptations there. That is the reason why<br/>people who live out of town are so absolutely uncivilized.<br/>Civilization is not by any means an easy thing to attain to. There<br/>are only two ways by which man can reach it. One is by being<br/>cultured, the other by being corrupt. Country people have no<br/>opportunity of being either, so they stagnate."<br/><br/>"Culture and corruption," echoed Dorian. "I have known something<br/>of both. It seems terrible to me now that they should ever be found<br/>together. For I have a new ideal, Harry. I am going to alter. I<br/>think I have altered."<br/><br/>
