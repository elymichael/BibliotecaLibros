A cry of terror broke from Dorian Gray's lips, and he rushed
between the painter and the screen. "Basil," he said, looking very
pale, "you must not look at it. I don't wish you to."

"Not look at my own work! You are not serious. Why shouldn't I
look at it?" exclaimed Hallward, laughing.

"If you try to look at it, Basil, on my word of honour I will
never speak to you again as long as I live. I am quite serious. I
don't offer any explanation, and you are not to ask for any. But,
remember, if you touch this screen, everything is over between
us."

Hallward was thunderstruck. He looked at Dorian Gray in absolute
amazement. He had never seen him like this before. The lad was
actually pallid with rage. His hands were clenched, and the pupils
of his eyes were like disks of blue fire. He was trembling all
over.

"Dorian!"

"Don't speak!"

"But what is the matter? Of course I won't look at it if you
don't want me to," he said, rather coldly, turning on his heel and
going over towards the window. "But, really, it seems rather absurd
that I shouldn't see my own work, especially as I am going to
exhibit it in Paris in the autumn. I shall probably have to give it
another coat of varnish before that, so I must see it some day, and
why not to-day?"

"To exhibit it! You want to exhibit it?" exclaimed Dorian Gray,
a strange sense of terror creeping over him. Was the world going to
be shown his secret? Were people to gape at the mystery of his
life? That was impossible. Something—he did not know what—had to be
done at once.

"Yes; I don't suppose you will object to that. Georges Petit is
going to collect all my best pictures for a special exhibition in
the Rue de Seze, which will open the first week in October. The
portrait will only be away a month. I should think you could easily
spare it for that time. In fact, you are sure to be out of town.
And if you keep it always behind a screen, you can't care much
about it."

Dorian Gray passed his hand over his forehead. There were beads
of perspiration there. He felt that he was on the brink of a
horrible danger. "You told me a month ago that you would never
exhibit it," he cried. "Why have you changed your mind? You people
who go in for being consistent have just as many moods as others
have. The only difference is that your moods are rather
meaningless. You can't have forgotten that you assured me most
solemnly that nothing in the world would induce you to send it to
any exhibition. You told Harry exactly the same thing." He stopped
suddenly, and a gleam of light came into his eyes. He remembered
that Lord Henry had said to him once, half seriously and half in
jest, "If you want to have a strange quarter of an hour, get Basil
to tell you why he won't exhibit your picture. He told me why he
wouldn't, and it was a revelation to me." Yes, perhaps Basil, too,
had his secret. He would ask him and try.

"Basil," he said, coming over quite close and looking him
straight in the face, "we have each of us a secret. Let me know
yours, and I shall tell you mine. What was your reason for refusing
to exhibit my picture?"
