"Mother, I have something to ask you," he said. Her eyes<br/>wandered vaguely about the room. She made no answer. "Tell me the<br/>truth. I have a right to know. Were you married to my father?"<br/><br/>She heaved a deep sigh. It was a sigh of relief. The terrible<br/>moment, the moment that night and day, for weeks and months, she<br/>had dreaded, had come at last, and yet she felt no terror. Indeed,<br/>in some measure it was a disappointment to her. The vulgar<br/>directness of the question called for a direct answer. The<br/>situation had not been gradually led up to. It was crude. It<br/>reminded her of a bad rehearsal.<br/><br/>"No," she answered, wondering at the harsh simplicity of<br/>life.<br/><br/>"My father was a scoundrel then!" cried the lad, clenching his<br/>fists.<br/><br/>She shook her head. "I knew he was not free. We loved each other<br/>very much. If he had lived, he would have made provision for us.<br/>Don't speak against him, my son. He was your father, and a<br/>gentleman. Indeed, he was highly connected."<br/><br/>An oath broke from his lips. "I don't care for myself," he<br/>exclaimed, "but don't let Sibylâ€¦ . It is a gentleman, isn't it, who<br/>is in love with her, or says he is? Highly connected, too, I<br/>suppose."<br/><br/>For a moment a hideous sense of humiliation came over the woman.<br/>Her head drooped. She wiped her eyes with shaking hands. "Sibyl has<br/>a mother," she murmured; "I had none."<br/><br/>The lad was touched. He went towards her, and stooping down, he<br/>kissed her. "I am sorry if I have pained you by asking about my<br/>father," he said, "but I could not help it. I must go now.<br/>Good-bye. Don't forget that you will have only one child now to<br/>look after, and believe me that if this man wrongs my sister, I<br/>will find out who he is, track him down, and kill him like a dog. I<br/>swear it."<br/><br/>The exaggerated folly of the threat, the passionate gesture that<br/>accompanied it, the mad melodramatic words, made life seem more<br/>vivid to her. She was familiar with the atmosphere. She breathed<br/>more freely, and for the first time for many months she really<br/>admired her son. She would have liked to have continued the scene<br/>on the same emotional scale, but he cut her short. Trunks had to be<br/>carried down and mufflers looked for. The lodging-house drudge<br/>bustled in and out. There was the bargaining with the cabman. The<br/>moment was lost in vulgar details. It was with a renewed feeling of<br/>disappointment that she waved the tattered lace handkerchief from<br/>the window, as her son drove away. She was conscious that a great<br/>opportunity had been wasted. She consoled herself by telling Sibyl<br/>how desolate she felt her life would be, now that she had only one<br/>child to look after. She remembered the phrase. It had pleased her.<br/>Of the threat she said nothing. It was vividly and dramatically<br/>expressed. She felt that they would all laugh at it some day.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
