<br/>"How dreadful!" exclaimed Lady Agatha. "Really, some one should<br/>interfere."<br/><br/>"I am told, on excellent authority, that her father keeps an<br/>American dry-goods store," said Sir Thomas Burdon, looking<br/>supercilious.<br/><br/>"My uncle has already suggested pork-packing Sir Thomas."<br/><br/>"Dry-goods!

"He never<br/>means anything that he says."<br/><br/>"When America was discovered," said the Radical memberâ€” and he<br/>began to give some wearisome facts.

"I must confess that most of them are extremely<br/>pretty. And they dress well, too. They get all their dresses in<br/>Paris. I wish I could afford to do the same."<br/><br/>
