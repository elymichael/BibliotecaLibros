"I shall be charmed. A visit to Treadley would be a great<br/>privilege. It has a perfect host, and a perfect library."<br/><br/>"You will complete it," answered the old gentleman with a<br/>courteous bow. "And now I must bid good-bye to your excellent aunt.<br/>I am due at the Athenaeum. It is the hour when we sleep there."<br/><br/>"All of you, Mr. Erskine?"<br/><br/>"Forty of us, in forty arm-chairs. We are practising for an<br/>English Academy of Letters."<br/><br/>Lord Henry laughed and rose. "I am going to the park," he<br/>cried.<br/><br/>As he was passing out of the door, Dorian Gray touched him on<br/>the arm. "Let me come with you," he murmured.<br/><br/>"But I thought you had promised Basil Hallward to go and see<br/>him," answered Lord Henry.<br/><br/>"I would sooner come with you; yes, I feel I must come with you.<br/>Do let me. And you will promise to talk to me all the time? No one<br/>talks so wonderfully as you do."<br/><br/>"Ah! I have talked quite enough for to-day," said Lord Henry,<br/>smiling. "All I want now is to look at life. You may come and look<br/>at it with me, if you care to."<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
