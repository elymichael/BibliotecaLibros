A cry of terror broke from Dorian Gray's lips, and he rushed<br/>between the painter and the screen. "Basil," he said, looking very<br/>pale, "you must not look at it. I don't wish you to."<br/><br/>"Not look at my own work! You are not serious. Why shouldn't I<br/>look at it?" exclaimed Hallward, laughing.<br/><br/>"If you try to look at it, Basil, on my word of honour I will<br/>never speak to you again as long as I live. I am quite serious. I<br/>don't offer any explanation, and you are not to ask for any. But,<br/>remember, if you touch this screen, everything is over between<br/>us."<br/><br/>Hallward was thunderstruck. He looked at Dorian Gray in absolute<br/>amazement. He had never seen him like this before. The lad was<br/>actually pallid with rage. His hands were clenched, and the pupils<br/>of his eyes were like disks of blue fire. He was trembling all<br/>over.<br/><br/>"Dorian!"<br/><br/>"Don't speak!"<br/><br/>"But what is the matter? Of course I won't look at it if you<br/>don't want me to," he said, rather coldly, turning on his heel and<br/>going over towards the window. "But, really, it seems rather absurd<br/>that I shouldn't see my own work, especially as I am going to<br/>exhibit it in Paris in the autumn. I shall probably have to give it<br/>another coat of varnish before that, so I must see it some day, and<br/>why not to-day?"<br/><br/>"To exhibit it! You want to exhibit it?" exclaimed Dorian Gray,<br/>a strange sense of terror creeping over him. Was the world going to<br/>be shown his secret? Were people to gape at the mystery of his<br/>life? That was impossible. Something—he did not know what—had to be<br/>done at once.<br/><br/>"Yes; I don't suppose you will object to that. Georges Petit is<br/>going to collect all my best pictures for a special exhibition in<br/>the Rue de Seze, which will open the first week in October. The<br/>portrait will only be away a month. I should think you could easily<br/>spare it for that time. In fact, you are sure to be out of town.<br/>And if you keep it always behind a screen, you can't care much<br/>about it."<br/><br/>Dorian Gray passed his hand over his forehead. There were beads<br/>of perspiration there. He felt that he was on the brink of a<br/>horrible danger. "You told me a month ago that you would never<br/>exhibit it," he cried. "Why have you changed your mind? You people<br/>who go in for being consistent have just as many moods as others<br/>have. The only difference is that your moods are rather<br/>meaningless. You can't have forgotten that you assured me most<br/>solemnly that nothing in the world would induce you to send it to<br/>any exhibition. You told Harry exactly the same thing." He stopped<br/>suddenly, and a gleam of light came into his eyes. He remembered<br/>that Lord Henry had said to him once, half seriously and half in<br/>jest, "If you want to have a strange quarter of an hour, get Basil<br/>to tell you why he won't exhibit your picture. He told me why he<br/>wouldn't, and it was a revelation to me." Yes, perhaps Basil, too,<br/>had his secret. He would ask him and try.<br/><br/>"Basil," he said, coming over quite close and looking him<br/>straight in the face, "we have each of us a secret. Let me know<br/>yours, and I shall tell you mine. What was your reason for refusing<br/>to exhibit my picture?"<br/>
