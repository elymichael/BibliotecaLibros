<br/>"My dear fellow, she tried to found a salon, and only succeeded<br/>in opening a restaurant. How could I admire her? But tell me, what<br/>did she say about Mr. Dorian Gray?"<br/><br/>"Oh, something like, 'Charming boy—poor dear mother and I<br/>absolutely inseparable. Quite forget what he does—afraid he—<br/>doesn't do anything—oh, yes, plays the piano—or is it the violin,<br/>dear Mr. Gray?' Neither of us could help laughing, and we became<br/>friends at once."<br/><br/>"Laughter is not at all a bad beginning for a friendship, and it<br/>is far the best ending for one," said the young lord, plucking<br/>another daisy.<br/><br/>Hallward shook his head. "You don't understand what friendship<br/>is, Harry," he murmured—"or what enmity is, for that matter. You<br/>like every one; that is to say, you are indifferent to every<br/>one."<br/><br/>"How horribly unjust of you!" cried Lord Henry, tilting his hat<br/>back and looking up at the little clouds that, like ravelled skeins<br/>of glossy white silk, were drifting across the hollowed turquoise<br/>of the summer sky. "Yes; horribly unjust of you. I make a great<br/>difference between people. I choose my friends for their good<br/>looks, my acquaintances for their good characters, and my enemies<br/>for their good intellects. A man cannot be too careful in the<br/>choice of his enemies. I have not got one who is a fool. They are<br/>all men of some intellectual power, and consequently they all<br/>appreciate me. Is that very vain of me? I think it is rather<br/>vain."<br/><br/>"I should think it was, Harry. But according to your category I<br/>must be merely an acquaintance."<br/><br/>"My dear old Basil, you are much more than an acquaintance."<br/><br/>"And much less than a friend. A sort of brother, I suppose?"<br/><br/>"Oh, brothers! I don't care for brothers. My elder brother won't<br/>die, and my younger brothers seem never to do anything else."<br/><br/>"Harry!" exclaimed Hallward, frowning.<br/><br/>
