"Appreciate it? I am in love with it, Basil. It is part of
myself. I feel that."

"Well, as soon as you are dry, you shall be varnished, and
framed, and sent home. Then you can do what you like with
yourself." And he walked across the room and rang the bell for tea.
"You will have tea, of course, Dorian? And so will you, Harry? Or
do you object to such simple pleasures?"

"I adore simple pleasures," said Lord Henry. "They are the last
refuge of the complex. But I don't like scenes, except on the
stage. What absurd fellows you are, both of you! I wonder who it
was defined man as a rational animal. It was the most premature
definition ever given. Man is many things, but he is not rational.
I am glad he is not, after allâ€” though I wish you chaps would not
squabble over the picture. You had much better let me have it,
Basil. This silly boy doesn't really want it, and I really do."

"If you let any one have it but me, Basil, I shall never forgive
you!" cried Dorian Gray; "and I don't allow people to call me a
silly boy."

"You know the picture is yours, Dorian. I gave it to you before
it existed."

"And you know you have been a little silly, Mr. Gray, and that
you don't really object to being reminded that you are extremely
young."

"I should have objected very strongly this morning, Lord
Henry."

"Ah! this morning! You have lived since then."

There came a knock at the door, and the butler entered with a
laden tea-tray and set it down upon a small Japanese table. There
was a rattle of cups and saucers and the hissing of a fluted
Georgian urn. Two globe-shaped china dishes were brought in by a
page. Dorian Gray went over and poured out the tea. The two men
sauntered languidly to the table and examined what was under the
covers.

"Let us go to the theatre to-night," said Lord Henry. "There is
sure to be something on, somewhere. I have promised to dine at
White's, but it is only with an old friend, so I can send him a
wire to say that I am ill, or that I am prevented from coming in
consequence of a subsequent engagement. I think that would be a
rather nice excuse: it would have all the surprise of candour."

"It is such a bore putting on one's dress-clothes," muttered
Hallward. "And, when one has them on, they are so horrid."
