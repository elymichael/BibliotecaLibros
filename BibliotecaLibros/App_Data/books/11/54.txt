"He is a gentleman," said the lad sullenly.

"A prince!" she cried musically. "What more do you want?"

"He wants to enslave you."

"I shudder at the thought of being free."

"I want you to beware of him."

"To see him is to worship him; to know him is to trust him."

"Sibyl, you are mad about him."

She laughed and took his arm. "You dear old Jim, you talk as if
you were a hundred. Some day you will be in love yourself. Then you
will know what it is. Don't look so sulky. Surely you should be
glad to think that, though you are going away, you leave me happier
than I have ever been before. Life has been hard for us both,
terribly hard and difficult. But it will be different now. You are
going to a new world, and I have found one. Here are two chairs;
let us sit down and see the smart people go by."

They took their seats amidst a crowd of watchers. The tulip-beds
across the road flamed like throbbing rings of fire. A white dust—
tremulous cloud of orris-root it seemed—hung in the panting air.
The brightly coloured parasols danced and dipped like monstrous
butterflies.

She made her brother talk of himself, his hopes, his prospects.
He spoke slowly and with effort. They passed words to each other as
players at a game pass counters. Sibyl felt oppressed. She could
not communicate her joy. A faint smile curving that sullen mouth
was all the echo she could win. After some time she became silent.
Suddenly she caught a glimpse of golden hair and laughing lips, and
in an open carriage with two ladies Dorian Gray drove past.
