"I am all expectation, Basil," continued his companion, glancing<br/>at him.<br/><br/>"Oh, there is really very little to tell, Harry," answered the<br/>painter; "and I am afraid you will hardly understand it. Perhaps<br/>you will hardly believe it."<br/><br/>Lord Henry smiled, and leaning down, plucked a pink-petalled<br/>daisy from the grass and examined it. "I am quite sure I shall<br/>understand it," he replied, gazing intently at the little golden,<br/>white-feathered disk, "and as for believing things, I can believe<br/>anything, provided that it is quite incredible."<br/><br/>The wind shook some blossoms from the trees, and the heavy<br/>lilac-blooms, with their clustering stars, moved to and fro in the<br/>languid air. A grasshopper began to chirrup by the wall, and like a<br/>blue thread a long thin dragon-fly floated past on its brown gauze<br/>wings. Lord Henry felt as if he could hear Basil Hallward's heart<br/>beating, and wondered what was coming.<br/><br/>"The story is simply this," said the painter after some time.<br/>"Two months ago I went to a crush at Lady Brandon's. You know we<br/>poor artists have to show ourselves in society from time to time,<br/>just to remind the public that we are not savages. With an evening<br/>coat and a white tie, as you told me once, anybody, even a<br/>stock-broker, can gain a reputation for being civilized. Well,<br/>after I had been in the room about ten minutes, talking to huge<br/>overdressed dowagers and tedious academicians, I suddenly became<br/>conscious that some one was looking at me. I turned half-way round<br/>and saw Dorian Gray for the first time. When our eyes met, I felt<br/>that I was growing pale. A curious sensation of terror came over<br/>me. I knew that I had come face to face with some one whose mere<br/>personality was so fascinating that, if I allowed it to do so, it<br/>would absorb my whole nature, my whole soul, my very art itself. I<br/>did not want any external influence in my life. You know yourself,<br/>Harry, how independent I am by nature. I have always been my own<br/>master; had at least always been so, till I met Dorian Gray.<br/>Then—but I don't know how to explain it to you. Something seemed to<br/>tell me that I was on the verge of a terrible crisis in my life. I<br/>had a strange feeling that fate had in store for me exquisite joys<br/>and exquisite sorrows. I grew afraid and turned to quit the room.<br/>It was not conscience that made me do so: it was a sort of<br/>cowardice. I take no credit to myself for trying to escape."<br/><br/>"Conscience and cowardice are really the same things, Basil.<br/>Conscience is the trade-name of the firm. That is all."<br/><br/>"I don't believe that, Harry, and I don't believe you do either.<br/>However, whatever was my motive—and it may have been pride, for I<br/>used to be very proud—I certainly struggled to the door. There, of<br/>course, I stumbled against Lady Brandon. 'You are not going to run<br/>away so soon, Mr. Hallward?' she screamed out. You know her<br/>curiously shrill voice?"<br/><br/>"Yes; she is a peacock in everything but beauty," said Lord<br/>Henry, pulling the daisy to bits with his long nervous fingers.<br/><br/>"I could not get rid of her. She brought me up to royalties, and<br/>people with stars and garters, and elderly ladies with gigantic<br/>tiaras and parrot noses. She spoke of me as her dearest friend. I<br/>had only met her once before, but she took it into her head to<br/>lionize me. I believe some picture of mine had made a great success<br/>at the time, at least had been chattered about in the penny<br/>newspapers, which is the nineteenth-century standard of<br/>immortality. Suddenly I found myself face to face with the young<br/>man whose personality had so strangely stirred me. We were quite<br/>close, almost touching. Our eyes met again. It was reckless of me,<br/>but I asked Lady Brandon to introduce me to him. Perhaps it was not<br/>so reckless, after all. It was simply inevitable. We would have<br/>spoken to each other without any introduction. I am sure of that.<br/>Dorian told me so afterwards. He, too, felt that we were destined<br/>to know each other."<br/><br/>"And how did Lady Brandon describe this wonderful young man?"<br/>asked his companion. "I know she goes in for giving a rapid precis<br/>of all her guests. I remember her bringing me up to a truculent and<br/>red-faced old gentleman covered all over with orders and ribbons,<br/>and hissing into my ear, in a tragic whisper which must have been<br/>perfectly audible to everybody in the room, the most astounding<br/>details. I simply fled. I like to find out people for myself. But<br/>Lady Brandon treats her guests exactly as an auctioneer treats his<br/>goods. She either explains them entirely away, or tells one<br/>everything about them except what one wants to know."<br/><br/>"Poor Lady Brandon! You are hard on her, Harry!" said Hallward<br/>listlessly.<br/>
