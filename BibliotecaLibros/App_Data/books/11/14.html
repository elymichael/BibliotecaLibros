"Oh, I will make your peace with my aunt. She is quite devoted<br/>to you. And I don't think it really matters about your not being<br/>there. The audience probably thought it was a duet. When Aunt<br/>Agatha sits down to the piano, she makes quite enough noise for two<br/>people."<br/><br/>"That is very horrid to her, and not very nice to me," answered<br/>Dorian, laughing.<br/><br/>Lord Henry looked at him. Yes, he was certainly wonderfully<br/>handsome, with his finely curved scarlet lips, his frank blue eyes,<br/>his crisp gold hair. There was something in his face that made one<br/>trust him at once. All the candour of youth was there, as well as<br/>all youth's passionate purity. One felt that he had kept himself<br/>unspotted from the world. No wonder Basil Hallward worshipped<br/>him.<br/><br/>"You are too charming to go in for philanthropy, Mr. Grayâ€”far<br/>too charming." And Lord Henry flung himself down on the divan and<br/>opened his cigarette-case.<br/><br/>The painter had been busy mixing his colours and getting his<br/>brushes ready. He was looking worried, and when he heard Lord<br/>Henry's last remark, he glanced at him, hesitated for a moment, and<br/>then said, "Harry, I want to finish this picture to-day. Would you<br/>think it awfully rude of me if I asked you to go away?"<br/><br/>Lord Henry smiled and looked at Dorian Gray. "Am I to go, Mr.<br/>Gray?" he asked.<br/><br/>"Oh, please don't, Lord Henry. I see that Basil is in one of his<br/>sulky moods, and I can't bear him when he sulks. Besides, I want<br/>you to tell me why I should not go in for philanthropy."<br/><br/>"I don't know that I shall tell you that, Mr. Gray. It is so<br/>tedious a subject that one would have to talk seriously about it.<br/>But I certainly shall not run away, now that you have asked me to<br/>stop. You don't really mind, Basil, do you? You have often told me<br/>that you liked your sitters to have some one to chat to."<br/><br/>Hallward bit his lip. "If Dorian wishes it, of course you must<br/>stay. Dorian's whims are laws to everybody, except himself."<br/><br/>Lord Henry took up his hat and gloves. "You are very pressing,<br/>Basil, but I am afraid I must go. I have promised to meet a man at<br/>the Orleans. Good-bye, Mr. Gray. Come and see me some afternoon in<br/>Curzon Street. I am nearly always at home at five o'clock. Write to<br/>me when you are coming. I should be sorry to miss you."<br/><br/>"Basil," cried Dorian Gray, "if Lord Henry Wotton goes, I shall<br/>go, too. You never open your lips while you are painting, and it is<br/>horribly dull standing on a platform and trying to look pleasant.<br/>Ask him to stay. I insist upon it."<br/>
