"But what world says that?" asked Lord Henry, elevating his
eyebrows. "It can only be the next world. This world and I are on
excellent terms."

"Everybody I know says you are very wicked," cried the old lady,
shaking her head.

Lord Henry looked serious for some moments. "It is perfectly
monstrous," he said, at last, "the way people go about nowadays
saying things against one behind one's back that are absolutely and
entirely true."

"Isn't he incorrigible?" cried Dorian, leaning forward in his
chair.

"I hope so," said his hostess, laughing. "But really, if you all
worship Madame de Ferrol in this ridiculous way, I shall have to
marry again so as to be in the fashion."

"You will never marry again, Lady Narborough," broke in Lord
Henry. "You were far too happy. When a woman marries again, it is
because she detested her first husband. When a man marries again,
it is because he adored his first wife. Women try their luck; men
risk theirs."

"Narborough wasn't perfect," cried the old lady.

"If he had been, you would not have loved him, my dear lady,"
was the rejoinder. "Women love us for our defects. If we have
enough of them, they will forgive us everything, even our
intellects. You will never ask me to dinner again after saying
this, I am afraid, Lady Narborough, but it is quite true."

"Of course it is true, Lord Henry. If we women did not love you
for your defects, where would you all be? Not one of you would ever
be married. You would be a set of unfortunate bachelors. Not,
however, that that would alter you much. Nowadays all the married
men live like bachelors, and all the bachelors like married
men."

"Fin de siecle," murmured Lord Henry.

"Fin du globe," answered his hostess.
