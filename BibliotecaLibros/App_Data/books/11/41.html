<br/>"I am not laughing, Dorian; at least I am not laughing at you.<br/>But you should not say the greatest romance of your life. You<br/>should say the first romance of your life. You will always be<br/>loved, and you will always be in love with love. A grande passion<br/>is the privilege of people who have nothing to do. That is the one<br/>use of the idle classes of a country. Don't be afraid. There are<br/>exquisite things in store for you. This is merely the<br/>beginning."<br/><br/>"Do you think my nature so shallow?" cried Dorian Gray<br/>angrily.<br/><br/>"No; I think your nature so deep."<br/><br/>"How do you mean?"<br/><br/>"My dear boy, the people who love only once in their lives are<br/>really the shallow people. What they call their loyalty, and their<br/>fidelity, I call either the lethargy of custom or their lack of<br/>imagination. Faithfulness is to the emotional life what consistency<br/>is to the life of the intellect—simply a confession of failure.<br/>Faithfulness! I must analyse it some day. The passion for property<br/>is in it. There are many things that we would throw away if we were<br/>not afraid that others might pick them up. But I don't want to<br/>interrupt you. Go on with your story."<br/><br/>"Well, I found myself seated in a horrid little private box,<br/>with a vulgar drop-scene staring me in the face. I looked out from<br/>behind the curtain and surveyed the house. It was a tawdry affair,<br/>all Cupids and cornucopias, like a third-rate wedding-cake. The<br/>gallery and pit were fairly full, but the two rows of dingy stalls<br/>were quite empty, and there was hardly a person in what I suppose<br/>they called the dress-circle. Women went about with oranges and<br/>ginger-beer, and there was a terrible consumption of nuts going<br/>on."<br/><br/>"It must have been just like the palmy days of the British<br/>drama."<br/><br/>"Just like, I should fancy, and very depressing. I began to<br/>wonder what on earth I should do when I caught sight of the<br/>play-bill. What do you think the play was, Harry?"<br/><br/>"I should think 'The Idiot Boy', or 'Dumb but Innocent'. Our<br/>fathers used to like that sort of piece, I believe. The longer I<br/>live, Dorian, the more keenly I feel that whatever was good enough<br/>for our fathers is not good enough for us. In art, as in politics,<br/>les grandperes ont toujours tort."<br/><br/>"This play was good enough for us, Harry. It was Romeo and<br/>Juliet. I must admit that I was rather annoyed at the idea of<br/>seeing Shakespeare done in such a wretched hole of a place. Still,<br/>I felt interested, in a sort of way. At any rate, I determined to<br/>wait for the first act. There was a dreadful orchestra, presided<br/>over by a young Hebrew who sat at a cracked piano, that nearly<br/>drove me away, but at last the drop-scene was drawn up and the play<br/>began. Romeo was a stout elderly gentleman, with corked eyebrows, a<br/>husky tragedy voice, and a figure like a beer-barrel. Mercutio was<br/>almost as bad. He was played by the low-comedian, who had<br/>introduced gags of his own and was on most friendly terms with the<br/>pit. They were both as grotesque as the scenery, and that looked as<br/>if it had come out of a country-booth. But Juliet! Harry, imagine a<br/>girl, hardly seventeen years of age, with a little, flowerlike<br/>face, a small Greek head with plaited coils of dark-brown hair,<br/>eyes that were violet wells of passion, lips that were like the<br/>petals of a rose. She was the loveliest thing I had ever seen in my<br/>life. You said to me once that pathos left you unmoved, but that<br/>beauty, mere beauty, could fill your eyes with tears. I tell you,<br/>Harry, I could hardly see this girl for the mist of tears that came<br/>across me. And her voice—I never heard such a voice. It was very<br/>low at first, with deep mellow notes that seemed to fall singly<br/>upon one's ear. Then it became a little louder, and sounded like a<br/>flute or a distant hautboy. In the garden-scene it had all the<br/>tremulous ecstasy that one hears just before dawn when nightingales<br/>are singing. There were moments, later on, when it had the wild<br/>passion of violins. You know how a voice can stir one. Your voice<br/>and the voice of Sibyl Vane are two things that I shall never<br/>forget. When I close my eyes, I hear them, and each of them says<br/>something different. I don't know which to follow. Why should I not<br/>love her? Harry, I do love her. She is everything to me in life.<br/>Night after night I go to see her play. One evening she is<br/>Rosalind, and the next evening she is Imogen. I have seen her die<br/>in the gloom of an Italian tomb, sucking the poison from her<br/>lover's lips. I have watched her wandering through the forest of<br/>Arden, disguised as a pretty boy in hose and doublet and dainty<br/>cap. She has been mad, and has come into the presence of a guilty<br/>king, and given him rue to wear and bitter herbs to taste of. She<br/>has been innocent, and the black hands of jealousy have crushed her<br/>reedlike throat. I have seen her in every age and in every costume.<br/>Ordinary women never appeal to one's imagination. They are limited<br/>to their century. No glamour ever transfigures them. One knows<br/>their minds as easily as one knows their bonnets. One can always<br/>find them. There is no mystery in any of them. They ride in the<br/>park in the morning and chatter at tea-parties in the afternoon.<br/>They have their stereotyped smile and their fashionable manner.<br/>They are quite obvious. But an actress! How different an actress<br/>is! Harry! why didn't you tell me that the only thing worth loving<br/>is an actress?"<br/><br/>
