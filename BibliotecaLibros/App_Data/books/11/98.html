<br/>"I don't wish to know anything about them. I love scandals about<br/>other people, but scandals about myself don't interest me. They<br/>have not got the charm of novelty."<br/><br/>"They must interest you, Dorian. Every gentleman is interested<br/>in his good name. You don't want people to talk of you as something<br/>vile and degraded. Of course, you have your position, and your<br/>wealth, and all that kind of thing. But position and wealth are not<br/>everything. Mind you, I don't believe these rumours at all. At<br/>least, I can't believe them when I see you. Sin is a thing that<br/>writes itself across a man's face. It cannot be concealed. People<br/>talk sometimes of secret vices. There are no such things. If a<br/>wretched man has a vice, it shows itself in the lines of his mouth,<br/>the droop of his eyelids, the moulding of his hands even.<br/>Somebody—I won't mention his name, but you know him—came to me last<br/>year to have his portrait done. I had never seen him before, and<br/>had never heard anything about him at the time, though I have heard<br/>a good deal since. He offered an extravagant price. I refused him.<br/>There was something in the shape of his fingers that I hated. I<br/>know now that I was quite right in what I fancied about him. His<br/>life is dreadful. But you, Dorian, with your pure, bright, innocent<br/>face, and your marvellous untroubled youth— I can't believe<br/>anything against you. And yet I see you very seldom, and you never<br/>come down to the studio now, and when I am away from you, and I<br/>hear all these hideous things that people are whispering about you,<br/>I don't know what to say. Why is it, Dorian, that a man like the<br/>Duke of Berwick leaves the room of a club when you enter it? Why is<br/>it that so many gentlemen in London will neither go to your house<br/>or invite you to theirs? You used to be a friend of Lord Staveley.<br/>I met him at dinner last week. Your name happened to come up in<br/>conversation, in connection with the miniatures you have lent to<br/>the exhibition at the Dudley. Staveley curled his lip and said that<br/>you might have the most artistic tastes, but that you were a man<br/>whom no pure-minded girl should be allowed to know, and whom no<br/>chaste woman should sit in the same room with. I reminded him that<br/>I was a friend of yours, and asked him what he meant. He told me.<br/>He told me right out before everybody. It was horrible! Why is your<br/>friendship so fatal to young men? There was that wretched boy in<br/>the Guards who committed suicide. You were his great friend. There<br/>was Sir Henry Ashton, who had to leave England with a tarnished<br/>name. You and he were inseparable. What about Adrian Singleton and<br/>his dreadful end? What about Lord Kent's only son and his career? I<br/>met his father yesterday in St. James's Street. He seemed broken<br/>with shame and sorrow. What about the young Duke of Perth? What<br/>sort of life has he got now? What gentleman would associate with<br/>him?"<br/><br/>"Stop, Basil. You are talking about things of which you know<br/>nothing," said Dorian Gray, biting his lip, and with a note of<br/>infinite contempt in his voice. "You ask me why Berwick leaves a<br/>room when I enter it. It is because I know everything about his<br/>life, not because he knows anything about mine. With such blood as<br/>he has in his veins, how could his record be clean? You ask me<br/>about Henry Ashton and young Perth. Did I teach the one his vices,<br/>and the other his debauchery? If Kent's silly son takes his wife<br/>from the streets, what is that to me? If Adrian Singleton writes<br/>his friend's name across a bill, am I his keeper? I know how people<br/>chatter in England. The middle classes air their moral prejudices<br/>over their gross dinner-tables, and whisper about what they call<br/>the profligacies of their betters in order to try and pretend that<br/>they are in smart society and on intimate terms with the people<br/>they slander. In this country, it is enough for a man to have<br/>distinction and brains for every common tongue to wag against him.<br/>And what sort of lives do these people, who pose as being moral,<br/>lead themselves? My dear fellow, you forget that we are in the<br/>native land of the hypocrite."<br/><br/>"Dorian," cried Hallward, "that is not the question. England is<br/>bad enough I know, and English society is all wrong. That is the<br/>reason why I want you to be fine. You have not been fine. One has a<br/>right to judge of a man by the effect he has over his friends.<br/>Yours seem to lose all sense of honour, of goodness, of purity. You<br/>have filled them with a madness for pleasure. They have gone down<br/>into the depths. You led them there. Yes: you led them there, and<br/>yet you can smile, as you are smiling now. And there is worse<br/>behind. I know you and Harry are inseparable. Surely for that<br/>reason, if for none other, you should not have made his sister's<br/>name a by-word."<br/><br/>"Take care, Basil. You go too far."<br/><br/>"I must speak, and you must listen. You shall listen. When you<br/>met Lady Gwendolen, not a breath of scandal had ever touched her.<br/>Is there a single decent woman in London now who would drive with<br/>her in the park? Why, even her children are not allowed to live<br/>with her. Then there are other stories— stories that you have been<br/>seen creeping at dawn out of dreadful houses and slinking in<br/>disguise into the foulest dens in London. Are they true? Can they<br/>be true? When I first heard them, I laughed. I hear them now, and<br/>they make me shudder. What about your country-house and the life<br/>that is led there? Dorian, you don't know what is said about you. I<br/>won't tell you that I don't want to preach to you. I remember Harry<br/>saying once that every man who turned himself into an amateur<br/>curate for the moment always began by saying that, and then<br/>proceeded to break his word. I do want to preach to you. I want you<br/>to lead such a life as will make the world respect you. I want you<br/>to have a clean name and a fair record. I want you to get rid of<br/>the dreadful people you associate with. Don't shrug your shoulders<br/>like that. Don't be so indifferent. You have a wonderful influence.<br/>Let it be for good, not for evil. They say that you corrupt every<br/>one with whom you become intimate, and that it is quite sufficient<br/>for you to enter a house for shame of some kind to follow after. I<br/>don't know whether it is so or not. How should I know? But it is<br/>said of you. I am told things that it seems impossible to doubt.<br/>Lord Gloucester was one of my greatest friends at Oxford. He showed<br/>me a letter that his wife had written to him when she was dying<br/>alone in her villa at Mentone. Your name was implicated in the most<br/>terrible confession I ever read. I told him that it was absurd—that<br/>I knew you thoroughly and that you were incapable of anything of<br/>the kind. Know you? I wonder do I know you? Before I could answer<br/>that, I should have to see your soul."<br/><br/>"To see my soul!" muttered Dorian Gray, starting up from the<br/>sofa and turning almost white from fear.<br/><br/>"Yes," answered Hallward gravely, and with deep-toned sorrow in<br/>his voice, "to see your soul. But only God can do that."<br/><br/>A bitter laugh of mockery broke from the lips of the younger<br/>man. "You shall see it yourself, to-night!" he cried, seizing a<br/>lamp from the table. "Come: it is your own handiwork. Why shouldn't<br/>you look at it? You can tell the world all about it afterwards, if<br/>you choose. Nobody would believe you. If they did believe you, they<br/>would like me all the better for it. I know the age better than you<br/>do, though you will prate about it so tediously. Come, I tell you.<br/>You have chattered enough about corruption. Now you shall look on<br/>it face to face."<br/><br/>There was the madness of pride in every word he uttered. He<br/>stamped his foot upon the ground in his boyish insolent manner. He<br/>felt a terrible joy at the thought that some one else was to share<br/>his secret, and that the man who had painted the portrait that was<br/>the origin of all his shame was to be burdened for the rest of his<br/>life with the hideous memory of what he had done.<br/><br/>
