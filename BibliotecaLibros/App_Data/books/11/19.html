<br/>"My dear fellow, I congratulate you most warmly," he said. "It<br/>is the finest portrait of modern times. Mr. Gray, come over and<br/>look at yourself."<br/><br/>The lad started, as if awakened from some dream.<br/><br/>"Is it really finished?" he murmured, stepping down from the<br/>platform.<br/><br/>"Quite finished," said the painter. "And you have sat splendidly<br/>to-day. I am awfully obliged to you."<br/><br/>"That is entirely due to me," broke in Lord Henry. "Isn't it,<br/>Mr. Gray?"<br/><br/>Dorian made no answer, but passed listlessly in front of his<br/>picture and turned towards it. When he saw it he drew back, and his<br/>cheeks flushed for a moment with pleasure. A look of joy came into<br/>his eyes, as if he had recognized himself for the first time. He<br/>stood there motionless and in wonder, dimly conscious that Hallward<br/>was speaking to him, but not catching the meaning of his words. The<br/>sense of his own beauty came on him like a revelation. He had never<br/>felt it before. Basil Hallward's compliments had seemed to him to<br/>be merely the charming exaggeration of friendship. He had listened<br/>to them, laughed at them, forgotten them. They had not influenced<br/>his nature. Then had come Lord Henry Wotton with his strange<br/>panegyric on youth, his terrible warning of its brevity. That had<br/>stirred him at the time, and now, as he stood gazing at the shadow<br/>of his own loveliness, the full reality of the description flashed<br/>across him. Yes, there would be a day when his face would be<br/>wrinkled and wizen, his eyes dim and colourless, the grace of his<br/>figure broken and deformed. The scarlet would pass away from his<br/>lips and the gold steal from his hair. The life that was to make<br/>his soul would mar his body. He would become dreadful, hideous, and<br/>uncouth.<br/><br/>As he thought of it, a sharp pang of pain struck through him<br/>like a knife and made each delicate fibre of his nature quiver. His<br/>eyes deepened into amethyst, and across them came a mist of tears.<br/>He felt as if a hand of ice had been laid upon his heart.<br/><br/>"Don't you like it?" cried Hallward at last, stung a little by<br/>the lad's silence, not understanding what it meant.<br/><br/>"Of course he likes it," said Lord Henry. "Who wouldn't like it?<br/>It is one of the greatest things in modern art. I will give you<br/>anything you like to ask for it. I must have it."<br/><br/>"It is not my property, Harry."<br/><br/>
