nineteenth century is detestable. It is so sombre, so depressing.
Sin is the only real colour-element left in modern life."

"You really must not say things like that before Dorian,
Harry."

"Before which Dorian? The one who is pouring out tea for us, or
the one in the picture?"

"Before either."

"I should like to come to the theatre with you, Lord Henry,"
said the lad.

"Then you shall come; and you will come, too, Basil, won't
you?"

"I can't, really. I would sooner not. I have a lot of work to
do."

"Well, then, you and I will go alone, Mr. Gray."

"I should like that awfully."

The painter bit his lip and walked over, cup in hand, to the
picture. "I shall stay with the real Dorian," he said, sadly.
