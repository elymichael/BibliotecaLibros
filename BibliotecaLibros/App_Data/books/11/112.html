"You refuse?"<br/><br/>"Yes."<br/><br/>"I entreat you, Alan."<br/><br/>"It is useless."<br/><br/>The same look of pity came into Dorian Gray's eyes. Then he<br/>stretched out his hand, took a piece of paper, and wrote something<br/>on it. He read it over twice, folded it carefully, and pushed it<br/>across the table. Having done this, he got up and went over to the<br/>window.<br/><br/>Campbell looked at him in surprise, and then took up the paper,<br/>and opened it. As he read it, his face became ghastly pale and he<br/>fell back in his chair. A horrible sense of sickness came over him.<br/>He felt as if his heart was beating itself to death in some empty<br/>hollow.<br/><br/>After two or three minutes of terrible silence, Dorian turned<br/>round and came and stood behind him, putting his hand upon his<br/>shoulder.<br/><br/>"I am so sorry for you, Alan," he murmured, "but you leave me no<br/>alternative. I have a letter written already. Here it is. You see<br/>the address. If you don't help me, I must send it. If you don't<br/>help me, I will send it. You know what the result will be. But you<br/>are going to help me. It is impossible for you to refuse now. I<br/>tried to spare you. You will do me the justice to admit that. You<br/>were stern, harsh, offensive. You treated me as no man has ever<br/>dared to treat meâ€”no living man, at any rate. I bore it all. Now it<br/>is for me to dictate terms."<br/><br/>Campbell buried his face in his hands, and a shudder passed<br/>through him.<br/><br/>"Yes, it is my turn to dictate terms, Alan. You know what they<br/>are. The thing is quite simple. Come, don't work yourself into this<br/>fever. The thing has to be done. Face it, and do it."<br/><br/>A groan broke from Campbell's lips and he shivered all over. The<br/>ticking of the clock on the mantelpiece seemed to him to be<br/>dividing time into separate atoms of agony, each of which was too<br/>terrible to be borne. He felt as if an iron ring was being slowly<br/>tightened round his forehead, as if the disgrace with which he was<br/>threatened had already come upon him. The hand upon his shoulder<br/>weighed like a hand of lead. It was intolerable. It seemed to crush<br/>him.<br/>
