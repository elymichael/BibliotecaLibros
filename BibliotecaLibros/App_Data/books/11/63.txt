"I should have said that whatever they ask for they had first
given to us," murmured the lad gravely. "They create love in our
natures. They have a right to demand it back."

"That is quite true, Dorian," cried Hallward.

"Nothing is ever quite true," said Lord Henry.

"This is," interrupted Dorian. "You must admit, Harry, that
women give to men the very gold of their lives."

"Possibly," he sighed, "but they invariably want it back in such
very small change. That is the worry. Women, as some witty
Frenchman once put it, inspire us with the desire to do
masterpieces and always prevent us from carrying them out."

"Harry, you are dreadful! I don't know why I like you so
much."

"You will always like me, Dorian," he replied. "Will you have
some coffee, you fellows? Waiter, bring coffee, and fine-champagne,
and some cigarettes. No, don't mind the cigarettes—I have some.
Basil, I can't allow you to smoke cigars. You must have a
cigarette. A cigarette is the perfect type of a perfect pleasure.
It is exquisite, and it leaves one unsatisfied. What more can one
want? Yes, Dorian, you will always be fond of me. I represent to
you all the sins you have never had the courage to commit."

"What nonsense you talk, Harry!" cried the lad, taking a light
from a fire-breathing silver dragon that the waiter had placed on
the table. "Let us go down to the theatre. When Sibyl comes on the
stage you will have a new ideal of life. She will represent
something to you that you have never known."

"I have known everything," said Lord Henry, with a tired look in
his eyes, "but I am always ready for a new emotion. I am afraid,
however, that, for me at any rate, there is no such thing. Still,
your wonderful girl may thrill me. I love acting. It is so much
more real than life. Let us go. Dorian, you will come with me. I am
so sorry, Basil, but there is only room for two in the brougham.
You must follow us in a hansom."

They got up and put on their coats, sipping their coffee
standing. The painter was silent and preoccupied. There was a gloom
over him. He could not bear this marriage, and yet it seemed to him
to be better than many other things that might have happened. After
a few minutes, they all passed downstairs. He drove off by himself,
as had been arranged, and watched the flashing lights of the little
brougham in front of him. A strange sense of loss came over him. He
felt that Dorian Gray would never again be to him all that he had
been in the past. Life had come between them… . His eyes darkened,
and the crowded flaring streets became blurred to his eyes. When
the cab drew up at the theatre, it seemed to him that he had grown
years older.
