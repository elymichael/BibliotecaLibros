<br/>Three o'clock struck, and four, and the half-hour rang its<br/>double chime, but Dorian Gray did not stir. He was trying to gather<br/>up the scarlet threads of life and to weave them into a pattern; to<br/>find his way through the sanguine labyrinth of passion through<br/>which he was wandering. He did not know what to do, or what to<br/>think. Finally, he went over to the table and wrote a passionate<br/>letter to the girl he had loved, imploring her forgiveness and<br/>accusing himself of madness. He covered page after page with wild<br/>words of sorrow and wilder words of pain. There is a luxury in<br/>self-reproach. When we blame ourselves, we feel that no one else<br/>has a right to blame us. It is the confession, not the priest, that<br/>gives us absolution. When Dorian had finished the letter, he felt<br/>that he had been forgiven.<br/><br/>Suddenly there came a knock to the door, and he heard Lord<br/>Henry's voice outside. "My dear boy, I must see you. Let me in at<br/>once. I can't bear your shutting yourself up like this."<br/><br/>He made no answer at first, but remained quite still. The<br/>knocking still continued and grew louder. Yes, it was better to let<br/>Lord Henry in, and to explain to him the new life he was going to<br/>lead, to quarrel with him if it became necessary to quarrel, to<br/>part if parting was inevitable. He jumped up, drew the screen<br/>hastily across the picture, and unlocked the door.<br/><br/>"I am so sorry for it all, Dorian," said Lord Henry as he<br/>entered. "But you must not think too much about it."<br/><br/>"Do you mean about Sibyl Vane?" asked the lad.<br/><br/>"Yes, of course," answered Lord Henry, sinking into a chair and<br/>slowly pulling off his yellow gloves. "It is dreadful, from one<br/>point of view, but it was not your fault. Tell me, did you go<br/>behind and see her, after the play was over?"<br/><br/>"Yes."<br/><br/>"I felt sure you had. Did you make a scene with her?"<br/><br/>"I was brutal, Harryâ€”perfectly brutal. But it is all right now.<br/>I am not sorry for anything that has happened. It has taught me to<br/>know myself better."<br/><br/>"Ah, Dorian, I am so glad you take it in that way! I was afraid<br/>I would find you plunged in remorse and tearing that nice curly<br/>hair of yours."<br/><br/>
