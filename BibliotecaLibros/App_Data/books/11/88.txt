"What can I do for you, Mr. Gray?" he said, rubbing his fat
freckled hands. "I thought I would do myself the honour of coming
round in person. I have just got a beauty of a frame, sir. Picked
it up at a sale. Old Florentine. Came from Fonthill, I believe.
Admirably suited for a religious subject, Mr. Gray."

"I am so sorry you have given yourself the trouble of coming
round, Mr. Hubbard. I shall certainly drop in and look at the
frame— though I don't go in much at present for religious art—but
to-day I only want a picture carried to the top of the house for
me. It is rather heavy, so I thought I would ask you to lend me a
couple of your men."

"No trouble at all, Mr. Gray. I am delighted to be of any
service to you. Which is the work of art, sir?"

"This," replied Dorian, moving the screen back. "Can you move
it, covering and all, just as it is? I don't want it to get
scratched going upstairs."

"There will be no difficulty, sir," said the genial frame-maker,
beginning, with the aid of his assistant, to unhook the picture
from the long brass chains by which it was suspended. "And, now,
where shall we carry it to, Mr. Gray?"

"I will show you the way, Mr. Hubbard, if you will kindly follow
me. Or perhaps you had better go in front. I am afraid it is right
at the top of the house. We will go up by the front staircase, as
it is wider."

He held the door open for them, and they passed out into the
hall and began the ascent. The elaborate character of the frame had
made the picture extremely bulky, and now and then, in spite of the
obsequious protests of Mr. Hubbard, who had the true tradesman's
spirited dislike of seeing a gentleman doing anything useful,
Dorian put his hand to it so as to help them.

"Something of a load to carry, sir," gasped the little man when
they reached the top landing. And he wiped his shiny forehead.

"I am afraid it is rather heavy," murmured Dorian as he unlocked
the door that opened into the room that was to keep for him the
curious secret of his life and hide his soul from the eyes of
men.

He had not entered the place for more than four years—not,
indeed, since he had used it first as a play-room when he was a
child, and then as a study when he grew somewhat older. It was a
large, well-proportioned room, which had been specially built by
the last Lord Kelso for the use of the little grandson whom, for
his strange likeness to his mother, and also for other reasons, he
had always hated and desired to keep at a distance. It appeared to
Dorian to have but little changed. There was the huge Italian
cassone, with its fantastically painted panels and its tarnished
gilt mouldings, in which he had so often hidden himself as a boy.
There the satinwood book-case filled with his dog-eared
schoolbooks. On the wall behind it was hanging the same ragged
Flemish tapestry where a faded king and queen were playing chess in
a garden, while a company of hawkers rode by, carrying hooded birds
on their gauntleted wrists. How well he remembered it all! Every
moment of his lonely childhood came back to him as he looked round.
He recalled the stainless purity of his boyish life, and it seemed
horrible to him that it was here the fatal portrait was to be
hidden away. How little he had thought, in those dead days, of all
that was in store for him!
