<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>10<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>When his servant entered, be looked at him steadfastly and<br/>wondered if he had thought of peering behind the screen. The man<br/>was quite impassive and waited for his orders. Dorian lit a<br/>cigarette and walked over to the glass and glanced into it. He<br/>could see the reflection of Victor's face perfectly. It was like a<br/>placid mask of servility. There was nothing to be afraid of, there.<br/>Yet he thought it best to be on his guard.<br/><br/>Speaking very slowly, he told him to tell the house-keeper that<br/>he wanted to see her, and then to go to the frame-maker and ask him<br/>to send two of his men round at once. It seemed to him that as the<br/>man left the room his eyes wandered in the direction of the screen.<br/>Or was that merely his own fancy?<br/><br/>After a few moments, in her black silk dress, with old-fashioned<br/>thread mittens on her wrinkled hands, Mrs. Leaf bustled into the<br/>library. He asked her for the key of the schoolroom.<br/><br/>"The old schoolroom, Mr. Dorian?" she exclaimed. "Why, it is<br/>full of dust. I must get it arranged and put straight before you go<br/>into it. It is not fit for you to see, sir. It is not, indeed."<br/><br/>"I don't want it put straight, Leaf. I only want the key."<br/><br/>"Well, sir, you'll be covered with cobwebs if you go into it.<br/>Why, it hasn't been opened for nearly five yearsâ€”not since his<br/>lordship died."<br/><br/>
