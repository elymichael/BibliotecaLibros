Dorian walked to the door with a look of pain in his face. As he
drew the curtain aside, a hideous laugh broke from the painted lips
of the woman who had taken his money. "There goes the devil's
bargain!" she hiccoughed, in a hoarse voice.

"Curse you!" he answered, "don't call me that."

She snapped her fingers. "Prince Charming is what you like to be
called, ain't it?" she yelled after him.

The drowsy sailor leaped to his feet as she spoke, and looked
wildly round. The sound of the shutting of the hall door fell on
his ear. He rushed out as if in pursuit.

Dorian Gray hurried along the quay through the drizzling rain.
His meeting with Adrian Singleton had strangely moved him, and he
wondered if the ruin of that young life was really to be laid at
his door, as Basil Hallward had said to him with such infamy of
insult. He bit his lip, and for a few seconds his eyes grew sad.
Yet, after all, what did it matter to him? One's days were too
brief to take the burden of another's errors on one's shoulders.
Each man lived his own life and paid his own price for living it.
The only pity was one had to pay so often for a single fault. One
had to pay over and over again, indeed. In her dealings with man,
destiny never closed her accounts.

There are moments, psychologists tell us, when the passion for
sin, or for what the world calls sin, so dominates a nature that
every fibre of the body, as every cell of the brain, seems to be
instinct with fearful impulses. Men and women at such moments lose
the freedom of their will. They move to their terrible end as
automatons move. Choice is taken from them, and conscience is
either killed, or, if it lives at all, lives but to give rebellion
its fascination and disobedience its charm. For all sins, as
theologians weary not of reminding us, are sins of disobedience.
When that high spirit, that morning star of evil, fell from heaven,
it was as a rebel that he fell.

Callous, concentrated on evil, with stained mind, and soul
hungry for rebellion, Dorian Gray hastened on, quickening his step
as he went, but as he darted aside into a dim archway, that had
served him often as a short cut to the ill-famed place where he was
going, he felt himself suddenly seized from behind, and before be
had time to defend himself, he was thrust back against the wall,
with a brutal hand round his throat.

He struggled madly for life, and by a terrible effort wrenched
the tightening fingers away. In a second he heard the click of a
revolver, and saw the gleam of a polished barrel, pointing straight
at his head, and the dusky form of a short, thick-set man facing
him.

"What do you want?" he gasped.

"Keep quiet," said the man. "If you stir, I shoot you."
