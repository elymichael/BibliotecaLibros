"How serious you both are!" she cried. "What is the matter?"

"Nothing," he answered. "I suppose one must be serious
sometimes. Good-bye, Mother; I will have my dinner at five o'clock.
Everything is packed, except my shirts, so you need not
trouble."

"Good-bye, my son," she answered with a bow of strained
stateliness.

She was extremely annoyed at the tone he had adopted with her,
and there was something in his look that had made her feel
afraid.

"Kiss me, Mother," said the girl. Her flowerlike lips touched
the withered cheek and warmed its frost.

"My child! my child!" cried Mrs. Vane, looking up to the ceiling
in search of an imaginary gallery.

"Come, Sibyl," said her brother impatiently. He hated his
mother's affectations.

They went out into the flickering, wind-blown sunlight and
strolled down the dreary Euston Road. The passersby glanced in
wonder at the sullen heavy youth who, in coarse, ill-fitting
clothes, was in the company of such a graceful, refined-looking
girl. He was like a common gardener walking with a rose.

Jim frowned from time to time when he caught the inquisitive
glance of some stranger. He had that dislike of being stared at,
which comes on geniuses late in life and never leaves the
commonplace. Sibyl, however, was quite unconscious of the effect
she was producing. Her love was trembling in laughter on her lips.
She was thinking of Prince Charming, and, that she might think of
him all the more, she did not talk of him, but prattled on about
the ship in which Jim was going to sail, about the gold he was
certain to find, about the wonderful heiress whose life he was to
save from the wicked, red-shirted bushrangers. For he was not to
remain a sailor, or a supercargo, or whatever he was going to be.
Oh, no! A sailor's existence was dreadful. Fancy being cooped up in
a horrid ship, with the hoarse, hump-backed waves trying to get in,
and a black wind blowing the masts down and tearing the sails into
long screaming ribands! He was to leave the vessel at Melbourne,
bid a polite good-bye to the captain, and go off at once to the
gold-fields. Before a week was over he was to come across a large
nugget of pure gold, the largest nugget that had ever been
discovered, and bring it down to the coast in a waggon guarded by
six mounted policemen. The bushrangers were to attack them three
times, and be defeated with immense slaughter. Or, no. He was not
to go to the gold-fields at all. They were horrid places, where men
got intoxicated, and shot each other in bar-rooms, and used bad
language. He was to be a nice sheep-farmer, and one evening, as he
was riding home, he was to see the beautiful heiress being carried
off by a robber on a black horse, and give chase, and rescue her.
Of course, she would fall in love with him, and he with her, and
they would get married, and come home, and live in an immense house
in London. Yes, there were delightful things in store for him. But
he must be very good, and not lose his temper, or spend his money
foolishly. She was only a year older than he was, but she knew so
much more of life. He must be sure, also, to write to her by every
mail, and to say his prayers each night before he went to sleep.
God was very good, and would watch over him. She would pray for
him, too, and in a few years he would come back quite rich and
happy.

The lad listened sulkily to her and made no answer. He was
heart-sick at leaving home.
