For nearly ten minutes he stood there, motionless, with parted<br/>lips and eyes strangely bright. He was dimly conscious that<br/>entirely fresh influences were at work within him. Yet they seemed<br/>to him to have come really from himself. The few words that Basil's<br/>friend had said to him—words spoken by chance, no doubt, and with<br/>wilful paradox in them— had touched some secret chord that had<br/>never been touched before, but that he felt was now vibrating and<br/>throbbing to curious pulses.<br/><br/>Music had stirred him like that. Music had troubled him many<br/>times. But music was not articulate. It was not a new world, but<br/>rather another chaos, that it created in us. Words! Mere words! How<br/>terrible they were! How clear, and vivid, and cruel! One could not<br/>escape from them. And yet what a subtle magic there was in them!<br/>They seemed to be able to give a plastic form to formless things,<br/>and to have a music of their own as sweet as that of viol or of<br/>lute. Mere words! Was there anything so real as words?<br/><br/>Yes; there had been things in his boyhood that he had not<br/>understood. He understood them now. Life suddenly became<br/>fiery-coloured to him. It seemed to him that he had been walking in<br/>fire. Why had he not known it?<br/><br/>With his subtle smile, Lord Henry watched him. He knew the<br/>precise psychological moment when to say nothing. He felt intensely<br/>interested. He was amazed at the sudden impression that his words<br/>had produced, and, remembering a book that he had read when he was<br/>sixteen, a book which had revealed to him much that he had not<br/>known before, he wondered whether Dorian Gray was passing through a<br/>similar experience. He had merely shot an arrow into the air. Had<br/>it hit the mark? How fascinating the lad was!<br/><br/>Hallward painted away with that marvellous bold touch of his,<br/>that had the true refinement and perfect delicacy that in art, at<br/>any rate comes only from strength. He was unconscious of the<br/>silence.<br/><br/>"Basil, I am tired of standing," cried Dorian Gray suddenly. "I<br/>must go out and sit in the garden. The air is stifling here."<br/><br/>"My dear fellow, I am so sorry. When I am painting, I can't<br/>think of anything else. But you never sat better. You were<br/>perfectly still. And I have caught the effect I wanted— the<br/>half-parted lips and the bright look in the eyes. I don't know what<br/>Harry has been saying to you, but he has certainly made you have<br/>the most wonderful expression. I suppose he has been paying you<br/>compliments. You mustn't believe a word that he says."<br/><br/>"He has certainly not been paying me compliments. Perhaps that<br/>is the reason that I don't believe anything he has told me."<br/><br/>"You know you believe it all," said Lord Henry, looking at him<br/>with his dreamy languorous eyes. "I will go out to the garden with<br/>you. It is horribly hot in the studio. Basil, let us have something<br/>iced to drink, something with strawberries in it."<br/><br/>"Certainly, Harry. Just touch the bell, and when Parker comes I<br/>will tell him what you want. I have got to work up this background,<br/>so I will join you later on. Don't keep Dorian too long. I have<br/>never been in better form for painting than I am to-day. This is<br/>going to be my masterpiece. It is my masterpiece as it stands."<br/><br/>Lord Henry went out to the garden and found Dorian Gray burying<br/>his face in the great cool lilac-blossoms, feverishly drinking in<br/>their perfume as if it had been wine. He came close to him and put<br/>his hand upon his shoulder. "You are quite right to do that," he<br/>murmured. "Nothing can cure the soul but the senses, just as<br/>nothing can cure the senses but the soul."<br/>
