<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>The studio was filled with the rich odour of roses, and when the<br/>light summer wind stirred amidst the trees of the garden, there<br/>came through the open door the heavy scent of the lilac, or the<br/>more delicate perfume of the pink-flowering thorn.<br/><br/>From the corner of the divan of Persian saddle-bags on which he<br/>was lying, smoking, as was his custom, innumerable cigarettes, Lord<br/>Henry Wotton could just catch the gleam of the honey-sweet and<br/>honey-coloured blossoms of a laburnum, whose tremulous branches<br/>seemed hardly able to bear the burden of a beauty so flamelike as<br/>theirs; and now and then the fantastic shadows of birds in flight<br/>flitted across the long tussore-silk curtains that were stretched<br/>in front of the huge window, producing a kind of momentary Japanese<br/>effect, and making him think of those pallid, jade-faced painters<br/>of Tokyo who, through the medium of an art that is necessarily<br/>immobile, seek to convey the sense of swiftness and motion. The<br/>sullen murmur of the bees shouldering their way through the long<br/>unmown grass, or circling with monotonous insistence round the<br/>dusty gilt horns of the straggling woodbine, seemed to make the<br/>stillness more oppressive. The dim roar of London was like the<br/>bourdon note of a distant organ.<br/><br/>In the centre of the room, clamped to an upright easel, stood<br/>the full-length portrait of a young man of extraordinary personal<br/>beauty, and in front of it, some little distance away, was sitting<br/>the artist himself, Basil Hallward, whose sudden disappearance some<br/>years ago caused, at the time, such public excitement and gave rise<br/>to so many strange conjectures.<br/><br/>As the painter looked at the gracious and comely form he had so<br/>skilfully mirrored in his art, a smile of pleasure passed across<br/>his face, and seemed about to linger there. But he suddenly started<br/>up, and closing his eyes, placed his fingers upon the lids, as<br/>though he sought to imprison within his brain some curious dream<br/>from which he feared he might awake.<br/><br/>"It is your best work, Basil, the best thing you have ever<br/>done," said Lord Henry languidly. "You must certainly send it next<br/>year to the Grosvenor. The Academy is too large and too vulgar.<br/>Whenever I have gone there, there have been either so many people<br/>that I have not been able to see the pictures, which was dreadful,<br/>or so many pictures that I have not been able to see the people,<br/>which was worse. The Grosvenor is really the only place."<br/><br/>"I don't think I shall send it anywhere," he answered, tossing<br/>his head back in that odd way that used to make his friends laugh<br/>at him at Oxford. "No, I won't send it anywhere."<br/><br/>
