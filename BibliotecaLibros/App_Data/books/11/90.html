<br/>INQUEST ON AN ACTRESS.â€”An inquest was held this morning at the<br/>Bell Tavern, Hoxton Road, by Mr. Danby, the District Coroner, on<br/>the body of Sibyl Vane, a young actress recently engaged at the<br/>Royal Theatre, Holborn. A verdict of death by misadventure was<br/>returned. Considerable sympathy was expressed for the mother of the<br/>deceased, who was greatly affected during the giving of her own<br/>evidence, and that of Dr. Birrell, who had made the post-mortem<br/>examination of the deceased.<br/><br/>He frowned, and tearing the paper in two, went across the room<br/>and flung the pieces away. How ugly it all was! And how horribly<br/>real ugliness made things! He felt a little annoyed with Lord Henry<br/>for having sent him the report. And it was certainly stupid of him<br/>to have marked it with red pencil. Victor might have read it. The<br/>man knew more than enough English for that.<br/><br/>Perhaps he had read it and had begun to suspect something. And,<br/>yet, what did it matter? What had Dorian Gray to do with Sibyl<br/>Vane's death? There was nothing to fear. Dorian Gray had not killed<br/>her.<br/><br/>His eye fell on the yellow book that Lord Henry had sent him.<br/>What was it, he wondered. He went towards the little,<br/>pearl-coloured octagonal stand that had always looked to him like<br/>the work of some strange Egyptian bees that wrought in silver, and<br/>taking up the volume, flung himself into an arm-chair and began to<br/>turn over the leaves. After a few minutes he became absorbed. It<br/>was the strangest book that he had ever read. It seemed to him that<br/>in exquisite raiment, and to the delicate sound of flutes, the sins<br/>of the world were passing in dumb show before him. Things that he<br/>had dimly dreamed of were suddenly made real to him. Things of<br/>which he had never dreamed were gradually revealed.<br/><br/>It was a novel without a plot and with only one character,<br/>being, indeed, simply a psychological study of a certain young<br/>Parisian who spent his life trying to realize in the nineteenth<br/>century all the passions and modes of thought that belonged to<br/>every century except his own, and to sum up, as it were, in himself<br/>the various moods through which the world-spirit had ever passed,<br/>loving for their mere artificiality those renunciations that men<br/>have unwisely called virtue, as much as those natural rebellions<br/>that wise men still call sin. The style in which it was written was<br/>that curious jewelled style, vivid and obscure at once, full of<br/>argot and of archaisms, of technical expressions and of elaborate<br/>paraphrases, that characterizes the work of some of the finest<br/>artists of the French school of Symbolistes. There were in it<br/>metaphors as monstrous as orchids and as subtle in colour. The life<br/>of the senses was described in the terms of mystical philosophy.<br/>One hardly knew at times whether one was reading the spiritual<br/>ecstasies of some mediaeval saint or the morbid confessions of a<br/>modern sinner. It was a poisonous book. The heavy odour of incense<br/>seemed to cling about its pages and to trouble the brain. The mere<br/>cadence of the sentences, the subtle monotony of their music, so<br/>full as it was of complex refrains and movements elaborately<br/>repeated, produced in the mind of the lad, as he passed from<br/>chapter to chapter, a form of reverie, a malady of dreaming, that<br/>made him unconscious of the falling day and creeping shadows.<br/><br/>Cloudless, and pierced by one solitary star, a copper-green sky<br/>gleamed through the windows. He read on by its wan light till he<br/>could read no more. Then, after his valet had reminded him several<br/>times of the lateness of the hour, he got up, and going into the<br/>next room, placed the book on the little Florentine table that<br/>always stood at his bedside and began to dress for dinner.<br/><br/>It was almost nine o'clock before he reached the club, where he<br/>found Lord Henry sitting alone, in the morning-room, looking very<br/>much bored.<br/><br/>"I am so sorry, Harry," he cried, "but really it is entirely<br/>your fault. That book you sent me so fascinated me that I forgot<br/>how the time was going."<br/><br/>"Yes, I thought you would like it," replied his host, rising<br/>from his chair.<br/><br/>"I didn't say I liked it, Harry. I said it fascinated me. There<br/>is a great difference."<br/><br/>
