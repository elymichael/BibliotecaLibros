INQUEST ON AN ACTRESS.â€”An inquest was held this morning at the
Bell Tavern, Hoxton Road, by Mr. Danby, the District Coroner, on
the body of Sibyl Vane, a young actress recently engaged at the
Royal Theatre, Holborn. A verdict of death by misadventure was
returned. Considerable sympathy was expressed for the mother of the
deceased, who was greatly affected during the giving of her own
evidence, and that of Dr. Birrell, who had made the post-mortem
examination of the deceased.

He frowned, and tearing the paper in two, went across the room
and flung the pieces away. How ugly it all was! And how horribly
real ugliness made things! He felt a little annoyed with Lord Henry
for having sent him the report. And it was certainly stupid of him
to have marked it with red pencil. Victor might have read it. The
man knew more than enough English for that.

Perhaps he had read it and had begun to suspect something. And,
yet, what did it matter? What had Dorian Gray to do with Sibyl
Vane's death? There was nothing to fear. Dorian Gray had not killed
her.

His eye fell on the yellow book that Lord Henry had sent him.
What was it, he wondered. He went towards the little,
pearl-coloured octagonal stand that had always looked to him like
the work of some strange Egyptian bees that wrought in silver, and
taking up the volume, flung himself into an arm-chair and began to
turn over the leaves. After a few minutes he became absorbed. It
was the strangest book that he had ever read. It seemed to him that
in exquisite raiment, and to the delicate sound of flutes, the sins
of the world were passing in dumb show before him. Things that he
had dimly dreamed of were suddenly made real to him. Things of
which he had never dreamed were gradually revealed.

It was a novel without a plot and with only one character,
being, indeed, simply a psychological study of a certain young
Parisian who spent his life trying to realize in the nineteenth
century all the passions and modes of thought that belonged to
every century except his own, and to sum up, as it were, in himself
the various moods through which the world-spirit had ever passed,
loving for their mere artificiality those renunciations that men
have unwisely called virtue, as much as those natural rebellions
that wise men still call sin. The style in which it was written was
that curious jewelled style, vivid and obscure at once, full of
argot and of archaisms, of technical expressions and of elaborate
paraphrases, that characterizes the work of some of the finest
artists of the French school of Symbolistes. There were in it
metaphors as monstrous as orchids and as subtle in colour. The life
of the senses was described in the terms of mystical philosophy.
One hardly knew at times whether one was reading the spiritual
ecstasies of some mediaeval saint or the morbid confessions of a
modern sinner. It was a poisonous book. The heavy odour of incense
seemed to cling about its pages and to trouble the brain. The mere
cadence of the sentences, the subtle monotony of their music, so
full as it was of complex refrains and movements elaborately
repeated, produced in the mind of the lad, as he passed from
chapter to chapter, a form of reverie, a malady of dreaming, that
made him unconscious of the falling day and creeping shadows.

Cloudless, and pierced by one solitary star, a copper-green sky
gleamed through the windows. He read on by its wan light till he
could read no more. Then, after his valet had reminded him several
times of the lateness of the hour, he got up, and going into the
next room, placed the book on the little Florentine table that
always stood at his bedside and began to dress for dinner.

It was almost nine o'clock before he reached the club, where he
found Lord Henry sitting alone, in the morning-room, looking very
much bored.

"I am so sorry, Harry," he cried, "but really it is entirely
your fault. That book you sent me so fascinated me that I forgot
how the time was going."

"Yes, I thought you would like it," replied his host, rising
from his chair.

"I didn't say I liked it, Harry. I said it fascinated me. There
is a great difference."
