<br/>"I don't believe it is my picture."<br/><br/>"Can't you see your ideal in it?" said Dorian bitterly.<br/><br/>"My ideal, as you call itâ€¦ "<br/><br/>"As you called it."<br/><br/>"There was nothing evil in it, nothing shameful. You were to me<br/>such an ideal as I shall never meet again. This is the face of a<br/>satyr."<br/><br/>"It is the face of my soul."<br/><br/>"Christ! what a thing I must have worshipped! It has the eyes of<br/>a devil."<br/><br/>"Each of us has heaven and hell in him, Basil," cried Dorian<br/>with a wild gesture of despair.<br/><br/>Hallward turned again to the portrait and gazed at it. "My God!<br/>If it is true," he exclaimed, "and this is what you have done with<br/>your life, why, you must be worse even than those who talk against<br/>you fancy you to be!" He held the light up again to the canvas and<br/>examined it. The surface seemed to be quite undisturbed and as he<br/>had left it. It was from within, apparently, that the foulness and<br/>horror had come. Through some strange quickening of inner life the<br/>leprosies of sin were slowly eating the thing away. The rotting of<br/>a corpse in a watery grave was not so fearful.<br/><br/>His hand shook, and the candle fell from its socket on the floor<br/>and lay there sputtering. He placed his foot on it and put it out.<br/>Then he flung himself into the rickety chair that was standing by<br/>the table and buried his face in his hands.<br/><br/>
