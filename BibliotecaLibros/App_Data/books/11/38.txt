"Not seventeen, Lady Henry?"

"Well, eighteen, then. And I saw you with him the other night at
the opera." She laughed nervously as she spoke, and watched him
with her vague forget-me-not eyes. She was a curious woman, whose
dresses always looked as if they had been designed in a rage and
put on in a tempest. She was usually in love with somebody, and, as
her passion was never returned, she had kept all her illusions. She
tried to look picturesque, but only succeeded in being untidy. Her
name was Victoria, and she had a perfect mania for going to
church.

"That was at Lohengrin, Lady Henry, I think?"

"Yes; it was at dear Lohengrin. I like Wagner's music better
than anybody's. It is so loud that one can talk the whole time
without other people hearing what one says. That is a great
advantage, don't you think so, Mr. Gray?"

The same nervous staccato laugh broke from her thin lips, and
her fingers began to play with a long tortoise-shell
paper-knife.

Dorian smiled and shook his head: "I am afraid I don't think so,
Lady Henry. I never talk during music—at least, during good music.
If one hears bad music, it is one's duty to drown it in
conversation."

"Ah! that is one of Harry's views, isn't it, Mr. Gray? I always
hear Harry's views from his friends. It is the only way I get to
know of them. But you must not think I don't like good music. I
adore it, but I am afraid of it. It makes me too romantic. I have
simply worshipped pianists— two at a time, sometimes, Harry tells
me. I don't know what it is about them. Perhaps it is that they are
foreigners. They all are, ain't they? Even those that are born in
England become foreigners after a time, don't they? It is so clever
of them, and such a compliment to art. Makes it quite cosmopolitan,
doesn't it? You have never been to any of my parties, have you, Mr.
Gray? You must come. I can't afford orchids, but I share no expense
in foreigners. They make one's rooms look so picturesque. But here
is Harry! Harry, I came in to look for you, to ask you something— I
forget what it was—and I found Mr. Gray here. We have had such a
pleasant chat about music. We have quite the same ideas. No; I
think our ideas are quite different. But he has been most pleasant.
I am so glad I've seen him."

"I am charmed, my love, quite charmed," said Lord Henry,
elevating his dark, crescent-shaped eyebrows and looking at them
both with an amused smile. "So sorry I am late, Dorian. I went to
look after a piece of old brocade in Wardour Street and had to
bargain for hours for it. Nowadays people know the price of
everything and the value of nothing."

"I am afraid I must be going," exclaimed Lady Henry, breaking an
awkward silence with her silly sudden laugh. "I have promised to
drive with the duchess. Good-bye, Mr. Gray. Good-bye, Harry. You
are dining out, I suppose? So am I. Perhaps I shall see you at Lady
Thornbury's."

"I dare say, my dear," said Lord Henry, shutting the door behind
her as, looking like a bird of paradise that had been out all night
in the rain, she flitted out of the room, leaving a faint odour of
frangipanni. Then he lit a cigarette and flung himself down on the
sofa.

"Never marry a woman with straw-coloured hair, Dorian," he said
after a few puffs.
