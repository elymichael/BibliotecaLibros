"I can't tell you, Harry," he answered sadly. "And I dare say it
is only a fancy of mine. This unfortunate accident has upset me. I
have a horrible presentiment that something of the kind may happen
to me."

"What nonsense!"

"I hope it is, but I can't help feeling it. Ah! here is the
duchess, looking like Artemis in a tailor-made gown. You see we
have come back, Duchess."

"I have heard all about it, Mr. Gray," she answered. "Poor
Geoffrey is terribly upset. And it seems that you asked him not to
shoot the hare. How curious!"

"Yes, it was very curious. I don't know what made me say it.
Some whim, I suppose. It looked the loveliest of little live
things. But I am sorry they told you about the man. It is a hideous
subject."

"It is an annoying subject," broke in Lord Henry. "It has no
psychological value at all. Now if Geoffrey had done the thing on
purpose, how interesting he would be! I should like to know some
one who had committed a real murder."

"How horrid of you, Harry!" cried the duchess. "Isn't it, Mr.
Gray? Harry, Mr. Gray is ill again. He is going to faint."

Dorian drew himself up with an effort and smiled. "It is
nothing, Duchess," he murmured; "my nerves are dreadfully out of
order. That is all. I am afraid I walked too far this morning. I
didn't hear what Harry said. Was it very bad? You must tell me some
other time. I think I must go and lie down. You will excuse me,
won't you?"

They had reached the great flight of steps that led from the
conservatory on to the terrace. As the glass door closed behind
Dorian, Lord Henry turned and looked at the duchess with his
slumberous eyes. "Are you very much in love with him?" he
asked.

She did not answer for some time, but stood gazing at the
landscape. "I wish I knew," she said at last.
