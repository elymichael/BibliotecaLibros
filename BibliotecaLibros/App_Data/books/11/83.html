<br/>The painter shuddered in spite of himself. "Dorian, if I told<br/>you, you might like me less than you do, and you would certainly<br/>laugh at me. I could not bear your doing either of those two<br/>things. If you wish me never to look at your picture again, I am<br/>content. I have always you to look at. If you wish the best work I<br/>have ever done to be hidden from the world, I am satisfied. Your<br/>friendship is dearer to me than any fame or reputation."<br/><br/>"No, Basil, you must tell me," insisted Dorian Gray. "I think I<br/>have a right to know." His feeling of terror had passed away, and<br/>curiosity had taken its place. He was determined to find out Basil<br/>Hallward's mystery.<br/><br/>"Let us sit down, Dorian," said the painter, looking troubled.<br/>"Let us sit down. And just answer me one question. Have you noticed<br/>in the picture something curious?—something that probably at first<br/>did not strike you, but that revealed itself to you suddenly?"<br/><br/>"Basil!" cried the lad, clutching the arms of his chair with<br/>trembling hands and gazing at him with wild startled eyes.<br/><br/>"I see you did. Don't speak. Wait till you hear what I have to<br/>say. Dorian, from the moment I met you, your personality had the<br/>most extraordinary influence over me. I was dominated, soul, brain,<br/>and power, by you. You became to me the visible incarnation of that<br/>unseen ideal whose memory haunts us artists like an exquisite<br/>dream. I worshipped you. I grew jealous of every one to whom you<br/>spoke. I wanted to have you all to myself. I was only happy when I<br/>was with you. When you were away from me, you were still present in<br/>my art… . Of course, I never let you know anything about this. It<br/>would have been impossible. You would not have understood it. I<br/>hardly understood it myself. I only knew that I had seen perfection<br/>face to face, and that the world had become wonderful to my eyes—<br/>too wonderful, perhaps, for in such mad worships there is peril,<br/>the peril of losing them, no less than the peril of keeping them… .<br/>Weeks and weeks went on, and I grew more and more absorbed in you.<br/>Then came a new development. I had drawn you as Paris in dainty<br/>armour, and as Adonis with huntsman's cloak and polished<br/>boar-spear. Crowned with heavy lotus-blossoms you had sat on the<br/>prow of Adrian's barge, gazing across the green turbid Nile. You<br/>had leaned over the still pool of some Greek woodland and seen in<br/>the water's silent silver the marvel of your own face. And it had<br/>all been what art should be—unconscious, ideal, and remote. One<br/>day, a fatal day I sometimes think, I determined to paint a<br/>wonderful portrait of you as you actually are, not in the costume<br/>of dead ages, but in your own dress and in your own time. Whether<br/>it was the realism of the method, or the mere wonder of your own<br/>personality, thus directly presented to me without mist or veil, I<br/>cannot tell. But I know that as I worked at it, every flake and<br/>film of colour seemed to me to reveal my secret. I grew afraid that<br/>others would know of my idolatry. I felt, Dorian, that I had told<br/>too much, that I had put too much of myself into it. Then it was<br/>that I resolved never to allow the picture to be exhibited. You<br/>were a little annoyed; but then you did not realize all that it<br/>meant to me. Harry, to whom I talked about it, laughed at me. But I<br/>did not mind that. When the picture was finished, and I sat alone<br/>with it, I felt that I was right… . Well, after a few days the<br/>thing left my studio, and as soon as I had got rid of the<br/>intolerable fascination of its presence, it seemed to me that I had<br/>been foolish in imagining that I had seen anything in it, more than<br/>that you were extremely good-looking and that I could paint. Even<br/>now I cannot help feeling that it is a mistake to think that the<br/>passion one feels in creation is ever really shown in the work one<br/>creates. Art is always more abstract than we fancy. Form and colour<br/>tell us of form and colour—that is all. It often seems to me that<br/>art conceals the artist far more completely than it ever reveals<br/>him. And so when I got this offer from Paris, I determined to make<br/>your portrait the principal thing in my exhibition. It never<br/>occurred to me that you would refuse. I see now that you were<br/>right. The picture cannot be shown. You must not be angry with me,<br/>Dorian, for what I have told you. As I said to Harry, once, you are<br/>made to be worshipped."<br/><br/>Dorian Gray drew a long breath. The colour came back to his<br/>cheeks, and a smile played about his lips. The peril was over. He<br/>was safe for the time. Yet he could not help feeling infinite pity<br/>for the painter who had just made this strange confession to him,<br/>and wondered if he himself would ever be so dominated by the<br/>personality of a friend. Lord Henry had the charm of being very<br/>dangerous. But that was all. He was too clever and too cynical to<br/>be really fond of. Would there ever be some one who would fill him<br/>with a strange idolatry? Was that one of the things that life had<br/>in store?<br/><br/>"It is extraordinary to me, Dorian," said Hallward, "that you<br/>should have seen this in the portrait. Did you really see it?"<br/><br/>"I saw something in it," he answered, "something that seemed to<br/>me very curious."<br/><br/>"Well, you don't mind my looking at the thing now?"<br/><br/>Dorian shook his head. "You must not ask me that, Basil. I could<br/>not possibly let you stand in front of that picture."<br/><br/>
