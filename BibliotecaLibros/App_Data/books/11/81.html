<br/>The painter felt strangely moved. The lad was infinitely dear to<br/>him, and his personality had been the great turning point in his<br/>art. He could not bear the idea of reproaching him any more. After<br/>all, his indifference was probably merely a mood that would pass<br/>away. There was so much in him that was good, so much in him that<br/>was noble.<br/><br/>"Well, Dorian," he said at length, with a sad smile, "I won't<br/>speak to you again about this horrible thing, after to-day. I only<br/>trust your name won't be mentioned in connection with it. The<br/>inquest is to take place this afternoon. Have they summoned<br/>you?"<br/><br/>Dorian shook his head, and a look of annoyance passed over his<br/>face at the mention of the word "inquest." There was something so<br/>crude and vulgar about everything of the kind. "They don't know my<br/>name," he answered.<br/><br/>"But surely she did?"<br/><br/>"Only my Christian name, and that I am quite sure she never<br/>mentioned to any one. She told me once that they were all rather<br/>curious to learn who I was, and that she invariably told them my<br/>name was Prince Charming. It was pretty of her. You must do me a<br/>drawing of Sibyl, Basil. I should like to have something more of<br/>her than the memory of a few kisses and some broken pathetic<br/>words."<br/><br/>"I will try and do something, Dorian, if it would please you.<br/>But you must come and sit to me yourself again. I can't get on<br/>without you."<br/><br/>"I can never sit to you again, Basil. It is impossible!" he<br/>exclaimed, starting back.<br/><br/>The painter stared at him. "My dear boy, what nonsense!" he<br/>cried. "Do you mean to say you don't like what I did of you? Where<br/>is it? Why have you pulled the screen in front of it? Let me look<br/>at it. It is the best thing I have ever done. Do take the screen<br/>away, Dorian. It is simply disgraceful of your servant hiding my<br/>work like that. I felt the room looked different as I came in."<br/><br/>"My servant has nothing to do with it, Basil. You don't imagine<br/>I let him arrange my room for me? He settles my flowers for me<br/>sometimesâ€” that is all. No; I did it myself. The light was too<br/>strong on the portrait."<br/><br/>"Too strong! Surely not, my dear fellow? It is an admirable<br/>place for it. Let me see it." And Hallward walked towards the<br/>corner of the room.<br/><br/>
