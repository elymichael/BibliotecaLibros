Lord Henry elevated his eyebrows and looked at him in amazement<br/>through the thin blue wreaths of smoke that curled up in such<br/>fanciful whorls from his heavy, opium-tainted cigarette. "Not send<br/>it anywhere? My dear fellow, why? Have you any reason? What odd<br/>chaps you painters are! You do anything in the world to gain a<br/>reputation. As soon as you have one, you seem to want to throw it<br/>away. It is silly of you, for there is only one thing in the world<br/>worse than being talked about, and that is not being talked about.<br/>A portrait like this would set you far above all the young men in<br/>England, and make the old men quite jealous, if old men are ever<br/>capable of any emotion."<br/><br/>"I know you will laugh at me," he replied, "but I really can't<br/>exhibit it. I have put too much of myself into it."<br/><br/>Lord Henry stretched himself out on the divan and laughed. "Yes,<br/>I knew you would; but it is quite true, all the same." "Too much of<br/>yourself in it! Upon my word, Basil, I didn't know you were so<br/>vain; and I really can't see any resemblance between you, with your<br/>rugged strong face and your coal-black hair, and this young Adonis,<br/>who looks as if he was made out of ivory and rose-leaves. Why, my<br/>dear Basil, he is a Narcissus, and you— well, of course you have an<br/>intellectual expression and all that. But beauty, real beauty, ends<br/>where an intellectual expression begins. Intellect is in itself a<br/>mode of exaggeration, and destroys the harmony of any face. The<br/>moment one sits down to think, one becomes all nose, or all<br/>forehead, or something horrid. Look at the successful men in any of<br/>the learned professions. How perfectly hideous they are! Except, of<br/>course, in the Church. But then in the Church they don't think. A<br/>bishop keeps on saying at the age of eighty what he was told to say<br/>when he was a boy of eighteen, and as a natural consequence he<br/>always looks absolutely delightful. Your mysterious young friend,<br/>whose name you have never told me, but whose picture really<br/>fascinates me, never thinks. I feel quite sure of that. He is some<br/>brainless beautiful creature who should be always here in winter<br/>when we have no flowers to look at, and always here in summer when<br/>we want something to chill our intelligence. Don't flatter<br/>yourself, Basil: you are not in the least like him."<br/><br/>"You don't understand me, Harry," answered the artist. "Of<br/>course I am not like him. I know that perfectly well. Indeed, I<br/>should be sorry to look like him. You shrug your shoulders? I am<br/>telling you the truth. There is a fatality about all physical and<br/>intellectual distinction, the sort of fatality that seems to dog<br/>through history the faltering steps of kings. It is better not to<br/>be different from one's fellows. The ugly and the stupid have the<br/>best of it in this world. They can sit at their ease and gape at<br/>the play. If they know nothing of victory, they are at least spared<br/>the knowledge of defeat. They live as we all should<br/>live—undisturbed, indifferent, and without disquiet. They neither<br/>bring ruin upon others, nor ever receive it from alien hands. Your<br/>rank and wealth, Harry; my brains, such as they are—my art,<br/>whatever it may be worth; Dorian Gray's good looks—we shall all<br/>suffer for what the gods have given us, suffer terribly."<br/><br/>"Dorian Gray? Is that his name?" asked Lord Henry, walking<br/>across the studio towards Basil Hallward.<br/><br/>"Yes, that is his name. I didn't intend to tell it to you."<br/><br/>"But why not?"<br/><br/>"Oh, I can't explain. When I like people immensely, I never tell<br/>their names to any one. It is like surrendering a part of them. I<br/>have grown to love secrecy. It seems to be the one thing that can<br/>make modern life mysterious or marvellous to us. The commonest<br/>thing is delightful if one only hides it. When I leave town now I<br/>never tell my people where I am going. If I did, I would lose all<br/>my pleasure. It is a silly habit, I dare say, but somehow it seems<br/>to bring a great deal of romance into one's life. I suppose you<br/>think me awfully foolish about it?"<br/><br/>"Not at all," answered Lord Henry, "not at all, my dear Basil.<br/>You seem to forget that I am married, and the one charm of marriage<br/>is that it makes a life of deception absolutely necessary for both<br/>parties. I never know where my wife is, and my wife never knows<br/>what I am doing. When we meet—we do meet occasionally, when we dine<br/>out together, or go down to the Duke's—we tell each other the most<br/>absurd stories with the most serious faces. My wife is very good at<br/>it—much better, in fact, than I am. She never gets confused over<br/>her dates, and I always do. But when she does find me out, she<br/>makes no row at all. I sometimes wish she would; but she merely<br/>laughs at me."<br/><br/>"I hate the way you talk about your married life, Harry," said<br/>Basil Hallward, strolling towards the door that led into the<br/>garden. "I believe that you are really a very good husband, but<br/>that you are thoroughly ashamed of your own virtues. You are an<br/>extraordinary fellow. You never say a moral thing, and you never do<br/>a wrong thing. Your cynicism is simply a pose."<br/><br/>"Being natural is simply a pose, and the most irritating pose I<br/>know," cried Lord Henry, laughing; and the two young men went out<br/>into the garden together and ensconced themselves on a long bamboo<br/>seat that stood in the shade of a tall laurel bush. The sunlight<br/>slipped over the polished leaves. In the grass, white daisies were<br/>tremulous.<br/>
