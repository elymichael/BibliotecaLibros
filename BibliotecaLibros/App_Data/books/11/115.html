<br/>"It will be time enough, then, if you are back at half-past<br/>seven, Francis. Or stay: just leave my things out for dressing. You<br/>can have the evening to yourself. I am not dining at home, so I<br/>shall not want you."<br/><br/>"Thank you, sir," said the man, leaving the room.<br/><br/>"Now, Alan, there is not a moment to be lost. How heavy this<br/>chest is! I'll take it for you. You bring the other things." He<br/>spoke rapidly and in an authoritative manner. Campbell felt<br/>dominated by him. They left the room together.<br/><br/>When they reached the top landing, Dorian took out the key and<br/>turned it in the lock. Then he stopped, and a troubled look came<br/>into his eyes. He shuddered. "I don't think I can go in, Alan," he<br/>murmured.<br/><br/>"It is nothing to me. I don't require you," said Campbell<br/>coldly.<br/><br/>Dorian half opened the door. As he did so, he saw the face of<br/>his portrait leering in the sunlight. On the floor in front of it<br/>the torn curtain was lying. He remembered that the night before he<br/>had forgotten, for the first time in his life, to hide the fatal<br/>canvas, and was about to rush forward, when he drew back with a<br/>shudder.<br/><br/>What was that loathsome red dew that gleamed, wet and<br/>glistening, on one of the hands, as though the canvas had sweated<br/>blood? How horrible it was!â€”more horrible, it seemed to him for the<br/>moment, than the silent thing that he knew was stretched across the<br/>table, the thing whose grotesque misshapen shadow on the spotted<br/>carpet showed him that it had not stirred, but was still there, as<br/>he had left it.<br/><br/>He heaved a deep breath, opened the door a little wider, and<br/>with half-closed eyes and averted head, walked quickly in,<br/>determined that he would not look even once upon the dead man.<br/>Then, stooping down and taking up the gold-and-purple hanging, he<br/>flung it right over the picture.<br/><br/>There he stopped, feeling afraid to turn round, and his eyes<br/>fixed themselves on the intricacies of the pattern before him. He<br/>heard Campbell bringing in the heavy chest, and the irons, and the<br/>other things that he had required for his dreadful work. He began<br/>to wonder if he and Basil Hallward had ever met, and, if so, what<br/>they had thought of each other.<br/><br/>"Leave me now," said a stern voice behind him.<br/><br/>
