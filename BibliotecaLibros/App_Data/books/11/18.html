Dorian Gray listened, open-eyed and wondering. The spray of<br/>lilac fell from his hand upon the gravel. A furry bee came and<br/>buzzed round it for a moment. Then it began to scramble all over<br/>the oval stellated globe of the tiny blossoms. He watched it with<br/>that strange interest in trivial things that we try to develop when<br/>things of high import make us afraid, or when we are stirred by<br/>some new emotion for which we cannot find expression, or when some<br/>thought that terrifies us lays sudden siege to the brain and calls<br/>on us to yield. After a time the bee flew away. He saw it creeping<br/>into the stained trumpet of a Tyrian convolvulus. The flower seemed<br/>to quiver, and then swayed gently to and fro.<br/><br/>Suddenly the painter appeared at the door of the studio and made<br/>staccato signs for them to come in. They turned to each other and<br/>smiled.<br/><br/>"I am waiting," he cried. "Do come in. The light is quite<br/>perfect, and you can bring your drinks."<br/><br/>They rose up and sauntered down the walk together. Two<br/>green-and-white butterflies fluttered past them, and in the<br/>pear-tree at the corner of the garden a thrush began to sing.<br/><br/>"You are glad you have met me, Mr. Gray," said Lord Henry,<br/>looking at him.<br/><br/>"Yes, I am glad now. I wonder shall I always be glad?"<br/><br/>"Always! That is a dreadful word. It makes me shudder when I<br/>hear it. Women are so fond of using it. They spoil every romance by<br/>trying to make it last for ever. It is a meaningless word, too. The<br/>only difference between a caprice and a lifelong passion is that<br/>the caprice lasts a little longer."<br/><br/>As they entered the studio, Dorian Gray put his hand upon Lord<br/>Henry's arm. "In that case, let our friendship be a caprice," he<br/>murmured, flushing at his own boldness, then stepped up on the<br/>platform and resumed his pose.<br/><br/>Lord Henry flung himself into a large wicker arm-chair and<br/>watched him. The sweep and dash of the brush on the canvas made the<br/>only sound that broke the stillness, except when, now and then,<br/>Hallward stepped back to look at his work from a distance. In the<br/>slanting beams that streamed through the open doorway the dust<br/>danced and was golden. The heavy scent of the roses seemed to brood<br/>over everything.<br/><br/>After about a quarter of an hour Hallward stopped painting,<br/>looked for a long time at Dorian Gray, and then for a long time at<br/>the picture, biting the end of one of his huge brushes and<br/>frowning. "It is quite finished," he cried at last, and stooping<br/>down he wrote his name in long vermilion letters on the left-hand<br/>corner of the canvas.<br/><br/>Lord Henry came over and examined the picture. It was certainly<br/>a wonderful work of art, and a wonderful likeness as well.<br/>
