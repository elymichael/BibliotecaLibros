"Is it the real Dorian?" cried the original of the portrait,<br/>strolling across to him. "Am I really like that?"<br/><br/>"Yes; you are just like that."<br/><br/>"How wonderful, Basil!"<br/><br/>"At least you are like it in appearance. But it will never<br/>alter," sighed Hallward. "That is something."<br/><br/>"What a fuss people make about fidelity!" exclaimed Lord Henry.<br/>"Why, even in love it is purely a question for physiology. It has<br/>nothing to do with our own will. Young men want to be faithful, and<br/>are not; old men want to be faithless, and cannot: that is all one<br/>can say."<br/><br/>"Don't go to the theatre to-night, Dorian," said Hallward. "Stop<br/>and dine with me."<br/><br/>"I can't, Basil."<br/><br/>"Why?"<br/><br/>"Because I have promised Lord Henry Wotton to go with him."<br/><br/>"He won't like you the better for keeping your promises. He<br/>always breaks his own. I beg you not to go."<br/><br/>Dorian Gray laughed and shook his head.<br/>
