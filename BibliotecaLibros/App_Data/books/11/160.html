<br/>"Quite sure."<br/><br/>"Ah! then it must be an illusion. The things one feels<br/>absolutely certain about are never true. That is the fatality of<br/>faith, and the lesson of romance. How grave you are! Don't be so<br/>serious. What have you or I to do with the superstitions of our<br/>age? No: we have given up our belief in the soul. Play me<br/>something. Play me a nocturne, Dorian, and, as you play, tell me,<br/>in a low voice, how you have kept your youth. You must have some<br/>secret. I am only ten years older than you are, and I am wrinkled,<br/>and worn, and yellow. You are really wonderful, Dorian. You have<br/>never looked more charming than you do to-night. You remind me of<br/>the day I saw you first. You were rather cheeky, very shy, and<br/>absolutely extraordinary. You have changed, of course, but not in<br/>appearance. I wish you would tell me your secret. To get back my<br/>youth I would do anything in the world, except take exercise, get<br/>up early, or be respectable. Youth! There is nothing like it. It's<br/>absurd to talk of the ignorance of youth. The only people to whose<br/>opinions I listen now with any respect are people much younger than<br/>myself. They seem in front of me. Life has revealed to them her<br/>latest wonder. As for the aged, I always contradict the aged. I do<br/>it on principle. If you ask them their opinion on something that<br/>happened yesterday, they solemnly give you the opinions current in<br/>1820, when people wore high stocks, believed in everything, and<br/>knew absolutely nothing. How lovely that thing you are playing is!<br/>I wonder, did Chopin write it at Majorca, with the sea weeping<br/>round the villa and the salt spray dashing against the panes? It is<br/>marvellously romantic. What a blessing it is that there is one art<br/>left to us that is not imitative! Don't stop. I want music<br/>to-night. It seems to me that you are the young Apollo and that I<br/>am Marsyas listening to you. I have sorrows, Dorian, of my own,<br/>that even you know nothing of. The tragedy of old age is not that<br/>one is old, but that one is young. I am amazed sometimes at my own<br/>sincerity. Ah, Dorian, how happy you are! What an exquisite life<br/>you have had! You have drunk deeply of everything. You have crushed<br/>the grapes against your palate. Nothing has been hidden from you.<br/>And it has all been to you no more than the sound of music. It has<br/>not marred you. You are still the same."<br/><br/>"I am not the same, Harry."<br/><br/>"Yes, you are the same. I wonder what the rest of your life will<br/>be. Don't spoil it by renunciations. At present you are a perfect<br/>type. Don't make yourself incomplete. You are quite flawless now.<br/>You need not shake your head: you know you are. Besides, Dorian,<br/>don't deceive yourself. Life is not governed by will or intention.<br/>Life is a question of nerves, and fibres, and slowly built-up cells<br/>in which thought hides itself and passion has its dreams. You may<br/>fancy yourself safe and think yourself strong. But a chance tone of<br/>colour in a room or a morning sky, a particular perfume that you<br/>had once loved and that brings subtle memories with it, a line from<br/>a forgotten poem that you had come across again, a cadence from a<br/>piece of music that you had ceased to play— I tell you, Dorian,<br/>that it is on things like these that our lives depend. Browning<br/>writes about that somewhere; but our own senses will imagine them<br/>for us. There are moments when the odour of lilas blanc passes<br/>suddenly across me, and I have to live the strangest month of my<br/>life over again. I wish I could change places with you, Dorian. The<br/>world has cried out against us both, but it has always worshipped<br/>you. It always will worship you. You are the type of what the age<br/>is searching for, and what it is afraid it has found. I am so glad<br/>that you have never done anything, never carved a statue, or<br/>painted a picture, or produced anything outside of yourself! Life<br/>has been your art. You have set yourself to music. Your days are<br/>your sonnets."<br/><br/>Dorian rose up from the piano and passed his hand through his<br/>hair. "Yes, life has been exquisite," he murmured, "but I am not<br/>going to have the same life, Harry. And you must not say these<br/>extravagant things to me. You don't know everything about me. I<br/>think that if you did, even you would turn from me. You laugh.<br/>Don't laugh."<br/><br/>"Why have you stopped playing, Dorian? Go back and give me the<br/>nocturne over again. Look at that great, honey-coloured moon that<br/>hangs in the dusky air. She is waiting for you to charm her, and if<br/>you play she will come closer to the earth. You won't? Let us go to<br/>the club, then. It has been a charming evening, and we must end it<br/>charmingly. There is some one at White's who wants immensely to<br/>know you—young Lord Poole, Bournemouth's eldest son. He has already<br/>copied your neckties, and has begged me to introduce him to you. He<br/>is quite delightful and rather reminds me of you."<br/><br/>"I hope not," said Dorian with a sad look in his eyes. "But I am<br/>tired to-night, Harry. I shan't go to the club. It is nearly<br/>eleven, and I want to go to bed early."<br/><br/>"Do stay. You have never played so well as to-night. There was<br/>something in your touch that was wonderful. It had more expression<br/>than I had ever heard from it before."<br/><br/>"It is because I am going to be good," he answered, smiling. "I<br/>am a little changed already."<br/><br/>"You cannot change to me, Dorian," said Lord Henry. "You and I<br/>will always be friends."<br/><br/>
