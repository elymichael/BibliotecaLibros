<br/>"Yes, sir. He looks as if he had been a sort of sailor; tattooed<br/>on both arms, and that kind of thing."<br/><br/>"Was there anything found on him?" said Dorian, leaning forward<br/>and looking at the man with startled eyes. "Anything that would<br/>tell his name?"<br/><br/>"Some money, sirâ€”not much, and a six-shooter. There was no name<br/>of any kind. A decent-looking man, sir, but rough-like. A sort of<br/>sailor we think."<br/><br/>Dorian started to his feet. A terrible hope fluttered past him.<br/>He clutched at it madly. "Where is the body?" he exclaimed. "Quick!<br/>I must see it at once."<br/><br/>"It is in an empty stable in the Home Farm, sir. The folk don't<br/>like to have that sort of thing in their houses. They say a corpse<br/>brings bad luck."<br/><br/>"The Home Farm! Go there at once and meet me. Tell one of the<br/>grooms to bring my horse round. No. Never mind. I'll go to the<br/>stables myself. It will save time."<br/><br/>In less than a quarter of an hour, Dorian Gray was galloping<br/>down the long avenue as hard as he could go. The trees seemed to<br/>sweep past him in spectral procession, and wild shadows to fling<br/>themselves across his path. Once the mare swerved at a white<br/>gate-post and nearly threw him. He lashed her across the neck with<br/>his crop. She cleft the dusky air like an arrow. The stones flew<br/>from her hoofs.<br/><br/>At last he reached the Home Farm. Two men were loitering in the<br/>yard. He leaped from the saddle and threw the reins to one of them.<br/>In the farthest stable a light was glimmering. Something seemed to<br/>tell him that the body was there, and he hurried to the door and<br/>put his hand upon the latch.<br/><br/>There he paused for a moment, feeling that he was on the brink<br/>of a discovery that would either make or mar his life. Then he<br/>thrust the door open and entered.<br/><br/>On a heap of sacking in the far corner was lying the dead body<br/>of a man dressed in a coarse shirt and a pair of blue trousers. A<br/>spotted handkerchief had been placed over the face. A coarse<br/>candle, stuck in a bottle, sputtered beside it.<br/><br/>
