"But what world says that?" asked Lord Henry, elevating his<br/>eyebrows. "It can only be the next world. This world and I are on<br/>excellent terms."<br/><br/>"Everybody I know says you are very wicked," cried the old lady,<br/>shaking her head.<br/><br/>Lord Henry looked serious for some moments. "It is perfectly<br/>monstrous," he said, at last, "the way people go about nowadays<br/>saying things against one behind one's back that are absolutely and<br/>entirely true."<br/><br/>"Isn't he incorrigible?" cried Dorian, leaning forward in his<br/>chair.<br/><br/>"I hope so," said his hostess, laughing. "But really, if you all<br/>worship Madame de Ferrol in this ridiculous way, I shall have to<br/>marry again so as to be in the fashion."<br/><br/>"You will never marry again, Lady Narborough," broke in Lord<br/>Henry. "You were far too happy. When a woman marries again, it is<br/>because she detested her first husband. When a man marries again,<br/>it is because he adored his first wife. Women try their luck; men<br/>risk theirs."<br/><br/>"Narborough wasn't perfect," cried the old lady.<br/><br/>"If he had been, you would not have loved him, my dear lady,"<br/>was the rejoinder. "Women love us for our defects. If we have<br/>enough of them, they will forgive us everything, even our<br/>intellects. You will never ask me to dinner again after saying<br/>this, I am afraid, Lady Narborough, but it is quite true."<br/><br/>"Of course it is true, Lord Henry. If we women did not love you<br/>for your defects, where would you all be? Not one of you would ever<br/>be married. You would be a set of unfortunate bachelors. Not,<br/>however, that that would alter you much. Nowadays all the married<br/>men live like bachelors, and all the bachelors like married<br/>men."<br/><br/>"Fin de siecle," murmured Lord Henry.<br/><br/>"Fin du globe," answered his hostess.<br/>
