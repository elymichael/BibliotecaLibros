"Mother, Mother, I am so happy!" whispered the girl, burying her
face in the lap of the faded, tired-looking woman who, with back
turned to the shrill intrusive light, was sitting in the one
arm-chair that their dingy sitting-room contained. "I am so happy!"
she repeated, "and you must be happy, too!"

Mrs. Vane winced and put her thin, bismuth-whitened hands on her
daughter's head. "Happy!" she echoed, "I am only happy, Sibyl, when
I see you act. You must not think of anything but your acting. Mr.
Isaacs has been very good to us, and we owe him money."

The girl looked up and pouted. "Money, Mother?" she cried, "what
does money matter? Love is more than money."

"Mr. Isaacs has advanced us fifty pounds to pay off our debts
and to get a proper outfit for James. You must not forget that,
Sibyl. Fifty pounds is a very large sum. Mr. Isaacs has been most
considerate."

"He is not a gentleman, Mother, and I hate the way he talks to
me," said the girl, rising to her feet and going over to the
window.

"I don't know how we could manage without him," answered the
elder woman querulously.
