<br/>"Yes," echoed Dorian, leaning back in his chair and looking at<br/>Lord Henry over the heavy clusters of purple-lipped irises that<br/>stood in the centre of the table, "what do you mean by good,<br/>Harry?"<br/><br/>"To be good is to be in harmony with one's self," he replied,<br/>touching the thin stem of his glass with his pale, fine-pointed<br/>fingers. "Discord is to be forced to be in harmony with others.<br/>One's own life—that is the important thing. As for the lives of<br/>one's neighbours, if one wishes to be a prig or a Puritan, one can<br/>flaunt one's moral views about them, but they are not one's<br/>concern. Besides, individualism has really the higher aim. Modern<br/>morality consists in accepting the standard of one's age. I<br/>consider that for any man of culture to accept the standard of his<br/>age is a form of the grossest immorality."<br/><br/>"But, surely, if one lives merely for one's self, Harry, one<br/>pays a terrible price for doing so?" suggested the painter.<br/><br/>"Yes, we are overcharged for everything nowadays. I should fancy<br/>that the real tragedy of the poor is that they can afford nothing<br/>but self-denial. Beautiful sins, like beautiful things, are the<br/>privilege of the rich."<br/><br/>"One has to pay in other ways but money."<br/><br/>"What sort of ways, Basil?"<br/><br/>"Oh! I should fancy in remorse, in suffering, in&#160;… well, in<br/>the consciousness of degradation."<br/><br/>Lord Henry shrugged his shoulders. "My dear fellow, mediaeval<br/>art is charming, but mediaeval emotions are out of date. One can<br/>use them in fiction, of course. But then the only things that one<br/>can use in fiction are the things that one has ceased to use in<br/>fact. Believe me, no civilized man ever regrets a pleasure, and no<br/>uncivilized man ever knows what a pleasure is."<br/><br/>"I know what pleasure is," cried Dorian Gray. "It is to adore<br/>some one."<br/><br/>"That is certainly better than being adored," he answered,<br/>toying with some fruits. "Being adored is a nuisance. Women treat<br/>us just as humanity treats its gods. They worship us, and are<br/>always bothering us to do something for them."<br/><br/>
