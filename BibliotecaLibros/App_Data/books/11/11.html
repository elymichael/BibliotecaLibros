"I am very glad you didn't, Harry."<br/><br/>"Why?"<br/><br/>"I don't want you to meet him."<br/><br/>"You don't want me to meet him?"<br/><br/>"No."<br/><br/>"Mr. Dorian Gray is in the studio, sir," said the butler, coming<br/>into the garden.<br/><br/>"You must introduce me now," cried Lord Henry, laughing.<br/><br/>The painter turned to his servant, who stood blinking in the<br/>sunlight. "Ask Mr. Gray to wait, Parker: I shall be in in a few<br/>moments." The man bowed and went up the walk.<br/><br/>Then he looked at Lord Henry. "Dorian Gray is my dearest<br/>friend," he said. "He has a simple and a beautiful nature. Your<br/>aunt was quite right in what she said of him. Don't spoil him.<br/>Don't try to influence him. Your influence would be bad. The world<br/>is wide, and has many marvellous people in it. Don't take away from<br/>me the one person who gives to my art whatever charm it possesses:<br/>my life as an artist depends on him. Mind, Harry, I trust you." He<br/>spoke very slowly, and the words seemed wrung out of him almost<br/>against his will.<br/><br/>"What nonsense you talk!" said Lord Henry, smiling, and taking<br/>Hallward by the arm, he almost led him into the house.<br/><br/><br/>
