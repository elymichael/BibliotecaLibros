<br/>"I wish it were fin du globe," said Dorian with a sigh. "Life is<br/>a great disappointment."<br/><br/>"Ah, my dear," cried Lady Narborough, putting on her gloves,<br/>"don't tell me that you have exhausted life. When a man says that<br/>one knows that life has exhausted him. Lord Henry is very wicked,<br/>and I sometimes wish that I had been; but you are made to be goodâ€”<br/>you look so good. I must find you a nice wife. Lord Henry, don't<br/>you think that Mr. Gray should get married?"<br/><br/>"I am always telling him so, Lady Narborough," said Lord Henry<br/>with a bow.<br/><br/>"Well, we must look out for a suitable match for him. I shall go<br/>through Debrett carefully to-night and draw out a list of all the<br/>eligible young ladies."<br/><br/>"With their ages, Lady Narborough?" asked Dorian.<br/><br/>"Of course, with their ages, slightly edited. But nothing must<br/>be done in a hurry. I want it to be what The Morning Post calls a<br/>suitable alliance, and I want you both to be happy."<br/><br/>"What nonsense people talk about happy marriages!" exclaimed<br/>Lord Henry. "A man can be happy with any woman, as long as he does<br/>not love her."<br/><br/>"Ah! what a cynic you are!" cried the old lady, pushing back her<br/>chair and nodding to Lady Ruxton. "You must come and dine with me<br/>soon again. You are really an admirable tonic, much better than<br/>what Sir Andrew prescribes for me. You must tell me what people you<br/>would like to meet, though. I want it to be a delightful<br/>gathering."<br/><br/>"I like men who have a future and women who have a past," he<br/>answered. "Or do you think that would make it a petticoat<br/>party?"<br/><br/>"I fear so," she said, laughing, as she stood up. "A thousand<br/>pardons, my dear Lady Ruxton," she added, "I didn't see you hadn't<br/>finished your cigarette."<br/><br/>
