"Her name is Sibyl Vane."<br/><br/>"Never heard of her."<br/><br/>"No one has. People will some day, however. She is a<br/>genius."<br/><br/>"My dear boy, no woman is a genius. Women are a decorative sex.<br/>They never have anything to say, but they say it charmingly. Women<br/>represent the triumph of matter over mind, just as men represent<br/>the triumph of mind over morals."<br/><br/>"Harry, how can you?"<br/><br/>"My dear Dorian, it is quite true. I am analysing women at<br/>present, so I ought to know. The subject is not so abstruse as I<br/>thought it was. I find that, ultimately, there are only two kinds<br/>of women, the plain and the coloured. The plain women are very<br/>useful. If you want to gain a reputation for respectability, you<br/>have merely to take them down to supper. The other women are very<br/>charming. They commit one mistake, however. They paint in order to<br/>try and look young. Our grandmothers painted in order to try and<br/>talk brilliantly. Rouge and esprit used to go together. That is all<br/>over now. As long as a woman can look ten years younger than her<br/>own daughter, she is perfectly satisfied. As for conversation,<br/>there are only five women in London worth talking to, and two of<br/>these can't be admitted into decent society. However, tell me about<br/>your genius. How long have you known her?"<br/><br/>"Ah! Harry, your views terrify me."<br/><br/>"Never mind that. How long have you known her?"<br/><br/>"About three weeks."<br/><br/>"And where did you come across her?"<br/><br/>"I will tell you, Harry, but you mustn't be unsympathetic about<br/>it. After all, it never would have happened if I had not met you.<br/>You filled me with a wild desire to know everything about life. For<br/>days after I met you, something seemed to throb in my veins. As I<br/>lounged in the park, or strolled down Piccadilly, I used to look at<br/>every one who passed me and wonder, with a mad curiosity, what sort<br/>of lives they led. Some of them fascinated me. Others filled me<br/>with terror. There was an exquisite poison in the air. I had a<br/>passion for sensations… . Well, one evening about seven o'clock, I<br/>determined to go out in search of some adventure. I felt that this<br/>grey monstrous London of ours, with its myriads of people, its<br/>sordid sinners, and its splendid sins, as you once phrased it, must<br/>have something in store for me. I fancied a thousand things. The<br/>mere danger gave me a sense of delight. I remembered what you had<br/>said to me on that wonderful evening when we first dined together,<br/>about the search for beauty being the real secret of life. I don't<br/>know what I expected, but I went out and wandered eastward, soon<br/>losing my way in a labyrinth of grimy streets and black grassless<br/>squares. About half-past eight I passed by an absurd little<br/>theatre, with great flaring gas-jets and gaudy play-bills. A<br/>hideous Jew, in the most amazing waistcoat I ever beheld in my<br/>life, was standing at the entrance, smoking a vile cigar. He had<br/>greasy ringlets, and an enormous diamond blazed in the centre of a<br/>soiled shirt. 'Have a box, my Lord?' he said, when he saw me, and<br/>he took off his hat with an air of gorgeous servility. There was<br/>something about him, Harry, that amused me. He was such a monster.<br/>You will laugh at me, I know, but I really went in and paid a whole<br/>guinea for the stage-box. To the present day I can't make out why I<br/>did so; and yet if I hadn't— my dear Harry, if I hadn't—I should<br/>have missed the greatest romance of my life. I see you are<br/>laughing. It is horrid of you!"<br/>
