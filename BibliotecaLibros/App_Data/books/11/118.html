It was some consolation that Harry was to be there, and when the<br/>door opened and he heard his slow musical voice lending charm to<br/>some insincere apology, he ceased to feel bored.<br/><br/>But at dinner he could not eat anything. Plate after plate went<br/>away untasted. Lady Narborough kept scolding him for what she<br/>called "an insult to poor Adolphe, who invented the menu specially<br/>for you," and now and then Lord Henry looked across at him,<br/>wondering at his silence and abstracted manner. From time to time<br/>the butler filled his glass with champagne. He drank eagerly, and<br/>his thirst seemed to increase.<br/><br/>"Dorian," said Lord Henry at last, as the chaud-froid was being<br/>handed round, "what is the matter with you to-night? You are quite<br/>out of sorts."<br/><br/>"I believe he is in love," cried Lady Narborough, "and that he<br/>is afraid to tell me for fear I should be jealous. He is quite<br/>right. I certainly should."<br/><br/>"Dear Lady Narborough," murmured Dorian, smiling, "I have not<br/>been in love for a whole weekâ€”not, in fact, since Madame de Ferrol<br/>left town."<br/><br/>"How you men can fall in love with that woman!" exclaimed the<br/>old lady. "I really cannot understand it."<br/><br/>"It is simply because she remembers you when you were a little<br/>girl, Lady Narborough," said Lord Henry. "She is the one link<br/>between us and your short frocks."<br/><br/>"She does not remember my short frocks at all, Lord Henry. But I<br/>remember her very well at Vienna thirty years ago, and how<br/>decolletee she was then."<br/><br/>"She is still decolletee," he answered, taking an olive in his<br/>long fingers; "and when she is in a very smart gown she looks like<br/>an edition de luxe of a bad French novel. She is really wonderful,<br/>and full of surprises. Her capacity for family affection is<br/>extraordinary. When her third husband died, her hair turned quite<br/>gold from grief."<br/><br/>"How can you, Harry!" cried Dorian.<br/><br/>"It is a most romantic explanation," laughed the hostess. "But<br/>her third husband, Lord Henry! You don't mean to say Ferrol is the<br/>fourth?"<br/>
