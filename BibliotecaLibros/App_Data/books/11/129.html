"I don't want anything," murmured the young man.<br/><br/>"Never mind."<br/><br/>Adrian Singleton rose up wearily and followed Dorian to the bar.<br/>A half-caste, in a ragged turban and a shabby ulster, grinned a<br/>hideous greeting as he thrust a bottle of brandy and two tumblers<br/>in front of them. The women sidled up and began to chatter. Dorian<br/>turned his back on them and said something in a low voice to Adrian<br/>Singleton.<br/><br/>A crooked smile, like a Malay crease, writhed across the face of<br/>one of the women. "We are very proud to-night," she sneered.<br/><br/>"For God's sake don't talk to me," cried Dorian, stamping his<br/>foot on the ground. "What do you want? Money? Here it is. Don't<br/>ever talk to me again."<br/><br/>Two red sparks flashed for a moment in the woman's sodden eyes,<br/>then flickered out and left them dull and glazed. She tossed her<br/>head and raked the coins off the counter with greedy fingers. Her<br/>companion watched her enviously.<br/><br/>"It's no use," sighed Adrian Singleton. "I don't care to go<br/>back. What does it matter? I am quite happy here."<br/><br/>"You will write to me if you want anything, won't you?" said<br/>Dorian, after a pause.<br/><br/>"Perhaps."<br/><br/>"Good night, then."<br/><br/>"Good night," answered the young man, passing up the steps and<br/>wiping his parched mouth with a handkerchief.<br/>
