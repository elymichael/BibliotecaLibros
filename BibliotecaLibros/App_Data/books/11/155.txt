Dorian Gray shuddered. He felt that his could not be the hand to
take the handkerchief away, and called out to one of the
farm-servants to come to him.

"Take that thing off the face. I wish to see it," he said,
clutching at the door-post for support.

When the farm-servant had done so, he stepped forward. A cry of
joy broke from his lips. The man who had been shot in the thicket
was James Vane.

He stood there for some minutes looking at the dead body. As he
rode home, his eyes were full of tears, for he knew he was
safe.
