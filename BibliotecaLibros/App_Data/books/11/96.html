<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>12<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>It was on the ninth of November, the eve of his own<br/>thirty-eighth birthday, as he often remembered afterwards.<br/><br/>He was walking home about eleven o'clock from Lord Henry's,<br/>where he had been dining, and was wrapped in heavy furs, as the<br/>night was cold and foggy. At the corner of Grosvenor Square and<br/>South Audley Street, a man passed him in the mist, walking very<br/>fast and with the collar of his grey ulster turned up. He had a bag<br/>in his hand. Dorian recognized him. It was Basil Hallward. A<br/>strange sense of fear, for which he could not account, came over<br/>him. He made no sign of recognition and went on quickly in the<br/>direction of his own house.<br/><br/>But Hallward had seen him. Dorian heard him first stopping on<br/>the pavement and then hurrying after him. In a few moments, his<br/>hand was on his arm.<br/><br/>"Dorian! What an extraordinary piece of luck! I have been<br/>waiting for you in your library ever since nine o'clock. Finally I<br/>took pity on your tired servant and told him to go to bed, as he<br/>let me out. I am off to Paris by the midnight train, and I<br/>particularly wanted to see you before I left. I thought it was you,<br/>or rather your fur coat, as you passed me. But I wasn't quite sure.<br/>Didn't you recognize me?"<br/><br/>"In this fog, my dear Basil? Why, I can't even recognize<br/>Grosvenor Square. I believe my house is somewhere about here, but I<br/>don't feel at all certain about it. I am sorry you are going away,<br/>as I have not seen you for ages. But I suppose you will be back<br/>soon?"<br/><br/>"No: I am going to be out of England for six months. I intend to<br/>take a studio in Paris and shut myself up till I have finished a<br/>great picture I have in my head. However, it wasn't about myself I<br/>wanted to talk. Here we are at your door. Let me come in for a<br/>moment. I have something to say to you."<br/><br/>
