After he had drunk his cup of black coffee, he wiped his lips<br/>slowly with a napkin, motioned to his servant to wait, and going<br/>over to the table, sat down and wrote two letters. One he put in<br/>his pocket, the other he handed to the valet.<br/><br/>"Take this round to 152, Hertford Street, Francis, and if Mr.<br/>Campbell is out of town, get his address."<br/><br/>As soon as he was alone, he lit a cigarette and began sketching<br/>upon a piece of paper, drawing first flowers and bits of<br/>architecture, and then human faces. Suddenly he remarked that every<br/>face that he drew seemed to have a fantastic likeness to Basil<br/>Hallward. He frowned, and getting up, went over to the book-case<br/>and took out a volume at hazard. He was determined that he would<br/>not think about what had happened until it became absolutely<br/>necessary that he should do so.<br/><br/>When he had stretched himself on the sofa, he looked at the<br/>title-page of the book. It was Gautier's Emaux et Camees,<br/>Charpentier's Japanese-paper edition, with the Jacquemart etching.<br/>The binding was of citron-green leather, with a design of gilt<br/>trellis-work and dotted pomegranates. It had been given to him by<br/>Adrian Singleton. As he turned over the pages, his eye fell on the<br/>poem about the hand of Lacenaire, the cold yellow hand "du supplice<br/>encore mal lavee," with its downy red hairs and its "doigts de<br/>faune." He glanced at his own white taper fingers, shuddering<br/>slightly in spite of himself, and passed on, till he came to those<br/>lovely stanzas upon Venice:<br/><br/>Sur une gamme chromatique, Le sein de peries ruisselant, La<br/>Venus de l'Adriatique Sort de l'eau son corps rose et blanc.<br/><br/>Les domes, sur l'azur des ondes Suivant la phrase au pur<br/>contour, S'enflent comme des gorges rondes Que souleve un soupir<br/>d'amour.<br/><br/>L'esquif aborde et me depose, Jetant son amarre au pilier,<br/>Devant une facade rose, Sur le marbre d'un escalier.<br/><br/>How exquisite they were! As one read them, one seemed to be<br/>floating down the green water-ways of the pink and pearl city,<br/>seated in a black gondola with silver prow and trailing curtains.<br/>The mere lines looked to him like those straight lines of<br/>turquoise-blue that follow one as one pushes out to the Lido. The<br/>sudden flashes of colour reminded him of the gleam of the<br/>opal-and-iris-throated birds that flutter round the tall<br/>honeycombed Campanile, or stalk, with such stately grace, through<br/>the dim, dust-stained arcades. Leaning back with half-closed eyes,<br/>he kept saying over and over to himself:<br/><br/>"Devant une facade rose, Sur le marbre d'un escalier."<br/><br/>The whole of Venice was in those two lines. He remembered the<br/>autumn that he had passed there, and a wonderful love that had<br/>stirred him to mad delightful follies. There was romance in every<br/>place. But Venice, like Oxford, had kept the background for<br/>romance, and, to the true romantic, background was everything, or<br/>almost everything. Basil had been with him part of the time, and<br/>had gone wild over Tintoret. Poor Basil! What a horrible way for a<br/>man to die!<br/><br/>He sighed, and took up the volume again, and tried to forget. He<br/>read of the swallows that fly in and out of the little cafe at<br/>Smyrna where the Hadjis sit counting their amber beads and the<br/>turbaned merchants smoke their long tasselled pipes and talk<br/>gravely to each other; he read of the Obelisk in the Place de la<br/>Concorde that weeps tears of granite in its lonely sunless exile<br/>and longs to be back by the hot, lotus-covered Nile, where there<br/>are Sphinxes, and rose-red ibises, and white vultures with gilded<br/>claws, and crocodiles with small beryl eyes that crawl over the<br/>green steaming mud; he began to brood over those verses which,<br/>drawing music from kiss-stained marble, tell of that curious statue<br/>that Gautier compares to a contralto voice, the "monstre charmant"<br/>that couches in the porphyry-room of the Louvre. But after a time<br/>the book fell from his hand. He grew nervous, and a horrible fit of<br/>terror came over him. What if Alan Campbell should be out of<br/>England? Days would elapse before he could come back. Perhaps he<br/>might refuse to come. What could he do then? Every moment was of<br/>vital importance.<br/>
