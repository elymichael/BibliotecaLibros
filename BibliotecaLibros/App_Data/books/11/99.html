"Yes," he continued, coming closer to him and looking<br/>steadfastly into his stern eyes, "I shall show you my soul. You<br/>shall see the thing that you fancy only God can see."<br/><br/>Hallward started back. "This is blasphemy, Dorian!" he cried.<br/>"You must not say things like that. They are horrible, and they<br/>don't mean anything."<br/><br/>"You think so?" He laughed again.<br/><br/>"I know so. As for what I said to you to-night, I said it for<br/>your good. You know I have been always a stanch friend to you."<br/><br/>"Don't touch me. Finish what you have to say."<br/><br/>A twisted flash of pain shot across the painter's face. He<br/>paused for a moment, and a wild feeling of pity came over him.<br/>After all, what right had he to pry into the life of Dorian Gray?<br/>If he had done a tithe of what was rumoured about him, how much he<br/>must have suffered! Then he straightened himself up, and walked<br/>over to the fire-place, and stood there, looking at the burning<br/>logs with their frostlike ashes and their throbbing cores of<br/>flame.<br/><br/>"I am waiting, Basil," said the young man in a hard clear<br/>voice.<br/><br/>He turned round. "What I have to say is this," he cried. "You<br/>must give me some answer to these horrible charges that are made<br/>against you. If you tell me that they are absolutely untrue from<br/>beginning to end, I shall believe you. Deny them, Dorian, deny<br/>them! Can't you see what I am going through? My God! don't tell me<br/>that you are bad, and corrupt, and shameful."<br/><br/>Dorian Gray smiled. There was a curl of contempt in his lips.<br/>"Come upstairs, Basil," he said quietly. "I keep a diary of my life<br/>from day to day, and it never leaves the room in which it is<br/>written. I shall show it to you if you come with me."<br/><br/>"I shall come with you, Dorian, if you wish it. I see I have<br/>missed my train. That makes no matter. I can go to-morrow. But<br/>don't ask me to read anything to-night. All I want is a plain<br/>answer to my question."<br/><br/>"That shall be given to you upstairs. I could not give it here.<br/>You will not have to read long."<br/>
