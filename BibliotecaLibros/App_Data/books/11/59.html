"To some little actress or other."<br/><br/>"I can't believe it. Dorian is far too sensible."<br/><br/>"Dorian is far too wise not to do foolish things now and then,<br/>my dear Basil."<br/><br/>"Marriage is hardly a thing that one can do now and then,<br/>Harry."<br/><br/>"Except in America," rejoined Lord Henry languidly. "But I<br/>didn't say he was married. I said he was engaged to be married.<br/>There is a great difference. I have a distinct remembrance of being<br/>married, but I have no recollection at all of being engaged. I am<br/>inclined to think that I never was engaged."<br/><br/>"But think of Dorian's birth, and position, and wealth. It would<br/>be absurd for him to marry so much beneath him."<br/><br/>"If you want to make him marry this girl, tell him that, Basil.<br/>He is sure to do it, then. Whenever a man does a thoroughly stupid<br/>thing, it is always from the noblest motives."<br/><br/>"I hope the girl is good, Harry. I don't want to see Dorian tied<br/>to some vile creature, who might degrade his nature and ruin his<br/>intellect."<br/><br/>"Oh, she is better than goodâ€”she is beautiful," murmured Lord<br/>Henry, sipping a glass of vermouth and orange-bitters. "Dorian says<br/>she is beautiful, and he is not often wrong about things of that<br/>kind. Your portrait of him has quickened his appreciation of the<br/>personal appearance of other people. It has had that excellent<br/>effect, amongst others. We are to see her to-night, if that boy<br/>doesn't forget his appointment."<br/><br/>"Are you serious?"<br/><br/>"Quite serious, Basil. I should be miserable if I thought I<br/>should ever be more serious than I am at the present moment."<br/>
