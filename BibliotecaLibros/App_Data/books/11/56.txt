"Not as long as you love him, I suppose," was the sullen
answer.

"I shall love him for ever!" she cried.

"And he?"

"For ever, too!"

"He had better."

She shrank from him. Then she laughed and put her hand on his
arm. He was merely a boy.

At the Marble Arch they hailed an omnibus, which left them close
to their shabby home in the Euston Road. It was after five o'clock,
and Sibyl had to lie down for a couple of hours before acting. Jim
insisted that she should do so. He said that he would sooner part
with her when their mother was not present. She would be sure to
make a scene, and he detested scenes of every kind.

In Sybil's own room they parted. There was jealousy in the lad's
heart, and a fierce murderous hatred of the stranger who, as it
seemed to him, had come between them. Yet, when her arms were flung
round his neck, and her fingers strayed through his hair, he
softened and kissed her with real affection. There were tears in
his eyes as he went downstairs.

His mother was waiting for him below. She grumbled at his
unpunctuality, as he entered. He made no answer, but sat down to
his meagre meal. The flies buzzed round the table and crawled over
the stained cloth. Through the rumble of omnibuses, and the clatter
of street-cabs, he could hear the droning voice devouring each
minute that was left to him.

After some time, he thrust away his plate and put his head in
his hands. He felt that he had a right to know. It should have been
told to him before, if it was as he suspected. Leaden with fear,
his mother watched him. Words dropped mechanically from her lips. A
tattered lace handkerchief twitched in her fingers. When the clock
struck six, he got up and went to the door. Then he turned back and
looked at her. Their eyes met. In hers he saw a wild appeal for
mercy. It enraged him.
