<br/>"I hate them for it," cried Hallward. "An artist should create<br/>beautiful things, but should put nothing of his own life into them.<br/>We live in an age when men treat art as if it were meant to be a<br/>form of autobiography. We have lost the abstract sense of beauty.<br/>Some day I will show the world what it is; and for that reason the<br/>world shall never see my portrait of Dorian Gray."<br/><br/>"I think you are wrong, Basil, but I won't argue with you. It is<br/>only the intellectually lost who ever argue. Tell me, is Dorian<br/>Gray very fond of you?"<br/><br/>The painter considered for a few moments. "He likes me," he<br/>answered after a pause; "I know he likes me. Of course I flatter<br/>him dreadfully. I find a strange pleasure in saying things to him<br/>that I know I shall be sorry for having said. As a rule, he is<br/>charming to me, and we sit in the studio and talk of a thousand<br/>things. Now and then, however, he is horribly thoughtless, and<br/>seems to take a real delight in giving me pain. Then I feel, Harry,<br/>that I have given away my whole soul to some one who treats it as<br/>if it were a flower to put in his coat, a bit of decoration to<br/>charm his vanity, an ornament for a summer's day."<br/><br/>"Days in summer, Basil, are apt to linger," murmured Lord Henry.<br/>"Perhaps you will tire sooner than he will. It is a sad thing to<br/>think of, but there is no doubt that genius lasts longer than<br/>beauty. That accounts for the fact that we all take such pains to<br/>over-educate ourselves. In the wild struggle for existence, we want<br/>to have something that endures, and so we fill our minds with<br/>rubbish and facts, in the silly hope of keeping our place. The<br/>thoroughly well-informed man—that is the modern ideal. And the mind<br/>of the thoroughly well-informed man is a dreadful thing. It is like<br/>a bric-a-brac shop, all monsters and dust, with everything priced<br/>above its proper value. I think you will tire first, all the same.<br/>Some day you will look at your friend, and he will seem to you to<br/>be a little out of drawing, or you won't like his tone of colour,<br/>or something. You will bitterly reproach him in your own heart, and<br/>seriously think that he has behaved very badly to you. The next<br/>time he calls, you will be perfectly cold and indifferent. It will<br/>be a great pity, for it will alter you. What you have told me is<br/>quite a romance, a romance of art one might call it, and the worst<br/>of having a romance of any kind is that it leaves one so<br/>unromantic."<br/><br/>"Harry, don't talk like that. As long as I live, the personality<br/>of Dorian Gray will dominate me. You can't feel what I feel. You<br/>change too often."<br/><br/>"Ah, my dear Basil, that is exactly why I can feel it. Those who<br/>are faithful know only the trivial side of love: it is the<br/>faithless who know love's tragedies." And Lord Henry struck a light<br/>on a dainty silver case and began to smoke a cigarette with a<br/>self-conscious and satisfied air, as if he had summed up the world<br/>in a phrase. There was a rustle of chirruping sparrows in the green<br/>lacquer leaves of the ivy, and the blue cloud-shadows chased<br/>themselves across the grass like swallows. How pleasant it was in<br/>the garden! And how delightful other people's emotions were!— much<br/>more delightful than their ideas, it seemed to him. One's own soul,<br/>and the passions of one's friends—those were the fascinating things<br/>in life. He pictured to himself with silent amusement the tedious<br/>luncheon that he had missed by staying so long with Basil Hallward.<br/>Had he gone to his aunt's, he would have been sure to have met Lord<br/>Goodbody there, and the whole conversation would have been about<br/>the feeding of the poor and the necessity for model lodging-houses.<br/>Each class would have preached the importance of those virtues, for<br/>whose exercise there was no necessity in their own lives. The rich<br/>would have spoken on the value of thrift, and the idle grown<br/>eloquent over the dignity of labour. It was charming to have<br/>escaped all that! As he thought of his aunt, an idea seemed to<br/>strike him. He turned to Hallward and said, "My dear fellow, I have<br/>just remembered."<br/><br/>"Remembered what, Harry?"<br/><br/>"Where I heard the name of Dorian Gray."<br/><br/>"Where was it?" asked Hallward, with a slight frown.<br/><br/>"Don't look so angry, Basil. It was at my aunt, Lady Agatha's.<br/>She told me she had discovered a wonderful young man who was going<br/>to help her in the East End, and that his name was Dorian Gray. I<br/>am bound to state that she never told me he was good-looking. Women<br/>have no appreciation of good looks; at least, good women have not.<br/>She said that he was very earnest and had a beautiful nature. I at<br/>once pictured to myself a creature with spectacles and lank hair,<br/>horribly freckled, and tramping about on huge feet. I wish I had<br/>known it was your friend."<br/><br/>
