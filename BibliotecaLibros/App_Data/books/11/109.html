<br/>They had been great friends once, five years before— almost<br/>inseparable, indeed. Then the intimacy had come suddenly to an end.<br/>When they met in society now, it was only Dorian Gray who smiled:<br/>Alan Campbell never did.<br/><br/>He was an extremely clever young man, though he had no real<br/>appreciation of the visible arts, and whatever little sense of the<br/>beauty of poetry he possessed he had gained entirely from Dorian.<br/>His dominant intellectual passion was for science. At Cambridge he<br/>had spent a great deal of his time working in the laboratory, and<br/>had taken a good class in the Natural Science Tripos of his year.<br/>Indeed, he was still devoted to the study of chemistry, and had a<br/>laboratory of his own in which he used to shut himself up all day<br/>long, greatly to the annoyance of his mother, who had set her heart<br/>on his standing for Parliament and had a vague idea that a chemist<br/>was a person who made up prescriptions. He was an excellent<br/>musician, however, as well, and played both the violin and the<br/>piano better than most amateurs. In fact, it was music that had<br/>first brought him and Dorian Gray together—music and that<br/>indefinable attraction that Dorian seemed to be able to exercise<br/>whenever he wished— and, indeed, exercised often without being<br/>conscious of it. They had met at Lady Berkshire's the night that<br/>Rubinstein played there, and after that used to be always seen<br/>together at the opera and wherever good music was going on. For<br/>eighteen months their intimacy lasted. Campbell was always either<br/>at Selby Royal or in Grosvenor Square. To him, as to many others,<br/>Dorian Gray was the type of everything that is wonderful and<br/>fascinating in life. Whether or not a quarrel had taken place<br/>between them no one ever knew. But suddenly people remarked that<br/>they scarcely spoke when they met and that Campbell seemed always<br/>to go away early from any party at which Dorian Gray was present.<br/>He had changed, too—was strangely melancholy at times, appeared<br/>almost to dislike hearing music, and would never himself play,<br/>giving as his excuse, when he was called upon, that he was so<br/>absorbed in science that he had no time left in which to practise.<br/>And this was certainly true. Every day he seemed to become more<br/>interested in biology, and his name appeared once or twice in some<br/>of the scientific reviews in connection with certain curious<br/>experiments.<br/><br/>This was the man Dorian Gray was waiting for. Every second he<br/>kept glancing at the clock. As the minutes went by he became<br/>horribly agitated. At last he got up and began to pace up and down<br/>the room, looking like a beautiful caged thing. He took long<br/>stealthy strides. His hands were curiously cold.<br/><br/>The suspense became unbearable. Time seemed to him to be<br/>crawling with feet of lead, while he by monstrous winds was being<br/>swept towards the jagged edge of some black cleft of precipice. He<br/>knew what was waiting for him there; saw it, indeed, and,<br/>shuddering, crushed with dank hands his burning lids as though he<br/>would have robbed the very brain of sight and driven the eyeballs<br/>back into their cave. It was useless. The brain had its own food on<br/>which it battened, and the imagination, made grotesque by terror,<br/>twisted and distorted as a living thing by pain, danced like some<br/>foul puppet on a stand and grinned through moving masks. Then,<br/>suddenly, time stopped for him. Yes: that blind, slow-breathing<br/>thing crawled no more, and horrible thoughts, time being dead,<br/>raced nimbly on in front, and dragged a hideous future from its<br/>grave, and showed it to him. He stared at it. Its very horror made<br/>him stone.<br/><br/>At last the door opened and his servant entered. He turned<br/>glazed eyes upon him.<br/><br/>"Mr. Campbell, sir," said the man.<br/><br/>A sigh of relief broke from his parched lips, and the colour<br/>came back to his cheeks.<br/><br/>"Ask him to come in at once, Francis." He felt that he was<br/>himself again. His mood of cowardice had passed away.<br/><br/>The man bowed and retired. In a few moments, Alan Campbell<br/>walked in, looking very stern and rather pale, his pallor being<br/>intensified by his coal-black hair and dark eyebrows.<br/><br/>"Alan! This is kind of you. I thank you for coming."<br/><br/>
