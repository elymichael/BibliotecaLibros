"Yet you poisoned me with a book once. I should not forgive<br/>that. Harry, promise me that you will never lend that book to any<br/>one. It does harm."<br/><br/>"My dear boy, you are really beginning to moralize. You will<br/>soon be going about like the converted, and the revivalist, warning<br/>people against all the sins of which you have grown tired. You are<br/>much too delightful to do that. Besides, it is no use. You and I<br/>are what we are, and will be what we will be. As for being poisoned<br/>by a book, there is no such thing as that. Art has no influence<br/>upon action. It annihilates the desire to act. It is superbly<br/>sterile. The books that the world calls immoral are books that show<br/>the world its own shame. That is all. But we won't discuss<br/>literature. Come round to-morrow. I am going to ride at eleven. We<br/>might go together, and I will take you to lunch afterwards with<br/>Lady Branksome. She is a charming woman, and wants to consult you<br/>about some tapestries she is thinking of buying. Mind you come. Or<br/>shall we lunch with our little duchess? She says she never sees you<br/>now. Perhaps you are tired of Gladys? I thought you would be. Her<br/>clever tongue gets on one's nerves. Well, in any case, be here at<br/>eleven."<br/><br/>"Must I really come, Harry?"<br/><br/>"Certainly. The park is quite lovely now. I don't think there<br/>have been such lilacs since the year I met you."<br/><br/>"Very well. I shall be here at eleven," said Dorian. "Good<br/>night, Harry." As he reached the door, he hesitated for a moment,<br/>as if he had something more to say. Then he sighed and went<br/>out.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
