<br/>"This is your doing, Harry," said the painter bitterly.<br/><br/>Lord Henry shrugged his shoulders. "It is the real Dorian Grayâ€”<br/>that is all."<br/><br/>"It is not."<br/><br/>"If it is not, what have I to do with it?"<br/><br/>"You should have gone away when I asked you," he muttered.<br/><br/>"I stayed when you asked me," was Lord Henry's answer.<br/><br/>"Harry, I can't quarrel with my two best friends at once, but<br/>between you both you have made me hate the finest piece of work I<br/>have ever done, and I will destroy it. What is it but canvas and<br/>colour? I will not let it come across our three lives and mar<br/>them."<br/><br/>Dorian Gray lifted his golden head from the pillow, and with<br/>pallid face and tear-stained eyes, looked at him as he walked over<br/>to the deal painting-table that was set beneath the high curtained<br/>window. What was he doing there? His fingers were straying about<br/>among the litter of tin tubes and dry brushes, seeking for<br/>something. Yes, it was for the long palette-knife, with its thin<br/>blade of lithe steel. He had found it at last. He was going to rip<br/>up the canvas.<br/><br/>With a stifled sob the lad leaped from the couch, and, rushing<br/>over to Hallward, tore the knife out of his hand, and flung it to<br/>the end of the studio. "Don't, Basil, don't!" he cried. "It would<br/>be murder!"<br/><br/>"I am glad you appreciate my work at last, Dorian," said the<br/>painter coldly when he had recovered from his surprise. "I never<br/>thought you would."<br/><br/>
