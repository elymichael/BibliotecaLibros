Upstairs, in his own room, Dorian Gray was lying on a sofa, with
terror in every tingling fibre of his body. Life had suddenly
become too hideous a burden for him to bear. The dreadful death of
the unlucky beater, shot in the thicket like a wild animal, had
seemed to him to pre-figure death for himself also. He had nearly
swooned at what Lord Henry had said in a chance mood of cynical
jesting.

At five o'clock he rang his bell for his servant and gave him
orders to pack his things for the night-express to town, and to
have the brougham at the door by eight-thirty. He was determined
not to sleep another night at Selby Royal. It was an ill-omened
place. Death walked there in the sunlight. The grass of the forest
had been spotted with blood.

Then he wrote a note to Lord Henry, telling him that he was
going up to town to consult his doctor and asking him to entertain
his guests in his absence. As he was putting it into the envelope,
a knock came to the door, and his valet informed him that the
head-keeper wished to see him. He frowned and bit his lip. "Send
him in," he muttered, after some moments' hesitation.

As soon as the man entered, Dorian pulled his chequebook out of
a drawer and spread it out before him.

"I suppose you have come about the unfortunate accident of this
morning, Thornton?" he said, taking up a pen.

"Yes, sir," answered the gamekeeper.

"Was the poor fellow married? Had he any people dependent on
him?" asked Dorian, looking bored. "If so, I should not like them
to be left in want, and will send them any sum of money you may
think necessary."

"We don't know who he is, sir. That is what I took the liberty
of coming to you about."

"Don't know who he is?" said Dorian, listlessly. "What do you
mean? Wasn't he one of your men?"

"No, sir. Never saw him before. Seems like a sailor, sir."

The pen dropped from Dorian Gray's hand, and he felt as if his
heart had suddenly stopped beating. "A sailor?" he cried out. "Did
you say a sailor?"
