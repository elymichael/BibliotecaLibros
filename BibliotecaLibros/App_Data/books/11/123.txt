"Oh, yes, Harry."

"He bores me dreadfully, almost as much as he bores her. She is
very clever, too clever for a woman. She lacks the indefinable
charm of weakness. It is the feet of clay that make the gold of the
image precious. Her feet are very pretty, but they are not feet of
clay. White porcelain feet, if you like. They have been through the
fire, and what fire does not destroy, it hardens. She has had
experiences."

"How long has she been married?" asked Dorian.

"An eternity, she tells me. I believe, according to the peerage,
it is ten years, but ten years with Monmouth must have been like
eternity, with time thrown in. Who else is coming?"

"Oh, the Willoughbys, Lord Rugby and his wife, our hostess,
Geoffrey Clouston, the usual set. I have asked Lord Grotrian."

"I like him," said Lord Henry. "A great many people don't, but I
find him charming. He atones for being occasionally somewhat
overdressed by being always absolutely over-educated. He is a very
modern type."

"I don't know if he will be able to come, Harry. He may have to
go to Monte Carlo with his father."

"Ah! what a nuisance people's people are! Try and make him come.
By the way, Dorian, you ran off very early last night. You left
before eleven. What did you do afterwards? Did you go straight
home?"

Dorian glanced at him hurriedly and frowned.

"No, Harry," he said at last, "I did not get home till nearly
three."
