He played with the idea and grew wilful; tossed it into the air
and transformed it; let it escape and recaptured it; made it
iridescent with fancy and winged it with paradox. The praise of
folly, as he went on, soared into a philosophy, and philosophy
herself became young, and catching the mad music of pleasure,
wearing, one might fancy, her wine-stained robe and wreath of ivy,
danced like a Bacchante over the hills of life, and mocked the slow
Silenus for being sober. Facts fled before her like frightened
forest things. Her white feet trod the huge press at which wise
Omar sits, till the seething grape-juice rose round her bare limbs
in waves of purple bubbles, or crawled in red foam over the vat's
black, dripping, sloping sides. It was an extraordinary
improvisation. He felt that the eyes of Dorian Gray were fixed on
him, and the consciousness that amongst his audience there was one
whose temperament he wished to fascinate seemed to give his wit
keenness and to lend colour to his imagination. He was brilliant,
fantastic, irresponsible. He charmed his listeners out of
themselves, and they followed his pipe, laughing. Dorian Gray never
took his gaze off him, but sat like one under a spell, smiles
chasing each other over his lips and wonder growing grave in his
darkening eyes.

At last, liveried in the costume of the age, reality entered the
room in the shape of a servant to tell the duchess that her
carriage was waiting. She wrung her hands in mock despair. "How
annoying!" she cried. "I must go. I have to call for my husband at
the club, to take him to some absurd meeting at Willis's Rooms,
where he is going to be in the chair. If I am late he is sure to be
furious, and I couldn't have a scene in this bonnet. It is far too
fragile. A harsh word would ruin it. No, I must go, dear Agatha.
Good-bye, Lord Henry, you are quite delightful and dreadfully
demoralizing. I am sure I don't know what to say about your views.
You must come and dine with us some night. Tuesday? Are you
disengaged Tuesday?"

"For you I would throw over anybody, Duchess," said Lord Henry
with a bow.

"Ah! that is very nice, and very wrong of you," she cried; "so
mind you come"; and she swept out of the room, followed by Lady
Agatha and the other ladies.

When Lord Henry had sat down again, Mr. Erskine moved round, and
taking a chair close to him, placed his hand upon his arm.

"You talk books away," he said; "why don't you write one?"

"I am too fond of reading books to care to write them, Mr.
Erskine. I should like to write a novel certainly, a novel that
would be as lovely as a Persian carpet and as unreal. But there is
no literary public in England for anything except newspapers,
primers, and encyclopaedias. Of all people in the world the English
have the least sense of the beauty of literature."

"I fear you are right," answered Mr. Erskine. "I myself used to
have literary ambitions, but I gave them up long ago. And now, my
dear young friend, if you will allow me to call you so, may I ask
if you really meant all that you said to us at lunch?"

"I quite forget what I said," smiled Lord Henry. "Was it all
very bad?"

"Very bad indeed. In fact I consider you extremely dangerous,
and if anything happens to our good duchess, we shall all look on
you as being primarily responsible. But I should like to talk to
you about life. The generation into which I was born was tedious.
Some day, when you are tired of London, come down to Treadley and
expound to me your philosophy of pleasure over some admirable
Burgundy I am fortunate enough to possess."
