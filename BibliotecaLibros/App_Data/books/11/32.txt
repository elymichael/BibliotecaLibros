"They say that when good Americans die they go to Paris,"
chuckled Sir Thomas, who had a large wardrobe of Humour's cast-off
clothes.

"Really! And where do bad Americans go to when they die?"
inquired the duchess.

"They go to America," murmured Lord Henry.

Sir Thomas frowned. "I am afraid that your nephew is prejudiced
against that great country," he said to Lady Agatha. "I have
travelled all over it in cars provided by the directors, who, in
such matters, are extremely civil. I assure you that it is an
education to visit it."

"But must we really see Chicago in order to be educated?" asked
Mr. Erskine plaintively. "I don't feel up to the journey."

Sir Thomas waved his hand. "Mr. Erskine of Treadley has the
world on his shelves. We practical men like to see things, not to
read about them. The Americans are an extremely interesting people.
They are absolutely reasonable. I think that is their
distinguishing characteristic. Yes, Mr. Erskine, an absolutely
reasonable people. I assure you there is no nonsense about the
Americans."

"How dreadful!" cried Lord Henry. "I can stand brute force, but
brute reason is quite unbearable. There is something unfair about
its use. It is hitting below the intellect."

"I do not understand you," said Sir Thomas, growing rather
red.

"I do, Lord Henry," murmured Mr. Erskine, with a smile.

"Paradoxes are all very well in their wayâ€¦ ." rejoined the
baronet.

"Was that a paradox?" asked Mr. Erskine. "I did not think so.
Perhaps it was. Well, the way of paradoxes is the way of truth. To
test reality we must see it on the tight rope. When the verities
become acrobats, we can judge them."
