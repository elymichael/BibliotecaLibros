<br/>"Oh, yes, Harry."<br/><br/>"He bores me dreadfully, almost as much as he bores her. She is<br/>very clever, too clever for a woman. She lacks the indefinable<br/>charm of weakness. It is the feet of clay that make the gold of the<br/>image precious. Her feet are very pretty, but they are not feet of<br/>clay. White porcelain feet, if you like. They have been through the<br/>fire, and what fire does not destroy, it hardens. She has had<br/>experiences."<br/><br/>"How long has she been married?" asked Dorian.<br/><br/>"An eternity, she tells me. I believe, according to the peerage,<br/>it is ten years, but ten years with Monmouth must have been like<br/>eternity, with time thrown in. Who else is coming?"<br/><br/>"Oh, the Willoughbys, Lord Rugby and his wife, our hostess,<br/>Geoffrey Clouston, the usual set. I have asked Lord Grotrian."<br/><br/>"I like him," said Lord Henry. "A great many people don't, but I<br/>find him charming. He atones for being occasionally somewhat<br/>overdressed by being always absolutely over-educated. He is a very<br/>modern type."<br/><br/>"I don't know if he will be able to come, Harry. He may have to<br/>go to Monte Carlo with his father."<br/><br/>"Ah! what a nuisance people's people are! Try and make him come.<br/>By the way, Dorian, you ran off very early last night. You left<br/>before eleven. What did you do afterwards? Did you go straight<br/>home?"<br/><br/>Dorian glanced at him hurriedly and frowned.<br/><br/>"No, Harry," he said at last, "I did not get home till nearly<br/>three."<br/><br/>
