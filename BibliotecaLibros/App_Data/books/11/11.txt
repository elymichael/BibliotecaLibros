"I am very glad you didn't, Harry."

"Why?"

"I don't want you to meet him."

"You don't want me to meet him?"

"No."

"Mr. Dorian Gray is in the studio, sir," said the butler, coming
into the garden.

"You must introduce me now," cried Lord Henry, laughing.

The painter turned to his servant, who stood blinking in the
sunlight. "Ask Mr. Gray to wait, Parker: I shall be in in a few
moments." The man bowed and went up the walk.

Then he looked at Lord Henry. "Dorian Gray is my dearest
friend," he said. "He has a simple and a beautiful nature. Your
aunt was quite right in what she said of him. Don't spoil him.
Don't try to influence him. Your influence would be bad. The world
is wide, and has many marvellous people in it. Don't take away from
me the one person who gives to my art whatever charm it possesses:
my life as an artist depends on him. Mind, Harry, I trust you." He
spoke very slowly, and the words seemed wrung out of him almost
against his will.

"What nonsense you talk!" said Lord Henry, smiling, and taking
Hallward by the arm, he almost led him into the house.
