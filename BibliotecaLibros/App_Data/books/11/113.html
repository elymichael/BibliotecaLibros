<br/>"Come, Alan, you must decide at once."<br/><br/>"I cannot do it," he said, mechanically, as though words could<br/>alter things.<br/><br/>"You must. You have no choice. Don't delay."<br/><br/>He hesitated a moment. "Is there a fire in the room<br/>upstairs?"<br/><br/>"Yes, there is a gas-fire with asbestos."<br/><br/>"I shall have to go home and get some things from the<br/>laboratory."<br/><br/>"No, Alan, you must not leave the house. Write out on a sheet of<br/>notepaper what you want and my servant will take a cab and bring<br/>the things back to you."<br/><br/>Campbell scrawled a few lines, blotted them, and addressed an<br/>envelope to his assistant. Dorian took the note up and read it<br/>carefully. Then he rang the bell and gave it to his valet, with<br/>orders to return as soon as possible and to bring the things with<br/>him.<br/><br/>As the hall door shut, Campbell started nervously, and having<br/>got up from the chair, went over to the chimney-piece. He was<br/>shivering with a kind of ague. For nearly twenty minutes, neither<br/>of the men spoke. A fly buzzed noisily about the room, and the<br/>ticking of the clock was like the beat of a hammer.<br/><br/>As the chime struck one, Campbell turned round, and looking at<br/>Dorian Gray, saw that his eyes were filled with tears. There was<br/>something in the purity and refinement of that sad face that seemed<br/>to enrage him. "You are infamous, absolutely infamous!" he<br/>muttered.<br/><br/>
