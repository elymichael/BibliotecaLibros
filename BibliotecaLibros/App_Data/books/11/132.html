<br/>"Forgive me, sir," muttered James Vane. "I was deceived. A<br/>chance word I heard in that damned den set me on the wrong<br/>track."<br/><br/>"You had better go home and put that pistol away, or you may get<br/>into trouble," said Dorian, turning on his heel and going slowly<br/>down the street.<br/><br/>James Vane stood on the pavement in horror. He was trembling<br/>from head to foot. After a little while, a black shadow that had<br/>been creeping along the dripping wall moved out into the light and<br/>came close to him with stealthy footsteps. He felt a hand laid on<br/>his arm and looked round with a start. It was one of the women who<br/>had been drinking at the bar.<br/><br/>"Why didn't you kill him?" she hissed out, putting haggard face<br/>quite close to his. "I knew you were following him when you rushed<br/>out from Daly's. You fool! You should have killed him. He has lots<br/>of money, and he's as bad as bad."<br/><br/>"He is not the man I am looking for," he answered, "and I want<br/>no man's money. I want a man's life. The man whose life I want must<br/>be nearly forty now. This one is little more than a boy. Thank God,<br/>I have not got his blood upon my hands."<br/><br/>The woman gave a bitter laugh. "Little more than a boy!" she<br/>sneered. "Why, man, it's nigh on eighteen years since Prince<br/>Charming made me what I am."<br/><br/>"You lie!" cried James Vane.<br/><br/>She raised her hand up to heaven. "Before God I am telling the<br/>truth," she cried.<br/><br/>"Before God?"<br/><br/>"Strike me dumb if it ain't so. He is the worst one that comes<br/>here. They say he has sold himself to the devil for a pretty face.<br/>It's nigh on eighteen years since I met him. He hasn't changed much<br/>since then. I have, though," she added, with a sickly leer.<br/><br/>
