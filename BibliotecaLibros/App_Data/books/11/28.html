"Mr. Dorian Gray does not belong to Blue Books, Uncle George,"<br/>said Lord Henry languidly.<br/><br/>"Mr. Dorian Gray? Who is he?" asked Lord Fermor, knitting his<br/>bushy white eyebrows.<br/><br/>"That is what I have come to learn, Uncle George. Or rather, I<br/>know who he is. He is the last Lord Kelso's grandson. His mother<br/>was a Devereux, Lady Margaret Devereaux. I want you to tell me<br/>about his mother. What was she like? Whom did she marry? You have<br/>known nearly everybody in your time, so you might have known her. I<br/>am very much interested in Mr. Gray at present. I have only just<br/>met him."<br/><br/>"Kelso's grandson!" echoed the old gentleman. "Kelso's<br/>grandson!&#160;… Of course… . I knew his mother intimately. I<br/>believe I was at her christening. She was an extraordinarily<br/>beautiful girl, Margaret Devereux, and made all the men frantic by<br/>running away with a penniless young fellow— a mere nobody, sir, a<br/>subaltern in a foot regiment, or something of that kind. Certainly.<br/>I remember the whole thing as if it happened yesterday. The poor<br/>chap was killed in a duel at Spa a few months after the marriage.<br/>There was an ugly story about it. They said Kelso got some rascally<br/>adventurer, some Belgian brute, to insult his son-in-law in<br/>public—paid him, sir, to do it, paid him— and that the fellow<br/>spitted his man as if he had been a pigeon. The thing was hushed<br/>up, but, egad, Kelso ate his chop alone at the club for some time<br/>afterwards. He brought his daughter back with him, I was told, and<br/>she never spoke to him again. Oh, yes; it was a bad business. The<br/>girl died, too, died within a year. So she left a son, did she? I<br/>had forgotten that. What sort of boy is he? If he is like his<br/>mother, he must be a good-looking chap."<br/><br/>"He is very good-looking," assented Lord Henry.<br/><br/>"I hope he will fall into proper hands," continued the old man.<br/>"He should have a pot of money waiting for him if Kelso did the<br/>right thing by him. His mother had money, too. All the Selby<br/>property came to her, through her grandfather. Her grandfather<br/>hated Kelso, thought him a mean dog. He was, too. Came to Madrid<br/>once when I was there. Egad, I was ashamed of him. The Queen used<br/>to ask me about the English noble who was always quarrelling with<br/>the cabmen about their fares. They made quite a story of it. I<br/>didn't dare show my face at Court for a month. I hope he treated<br/>his grandson better than he did the jarvies."<br/><br/>"I don't know," answered Lord Henry. "I fancy that the boy will<br/>be well off. He is not of age yet. He has Selby, I know. He told me<br/>so. And&#160;… his mother was very beautiful?"<br/><br/>"Margaret Devereux was one of the loveliest creatures I ever<br/>saw, Harry. What on earth induced her to behave as she did, I never<br/>could understand. She could have married anybody she chose.<br/>Carlington was mad after her. She was romantic, though. All the<br/>women of that family were. The men were a poor lot, but, egad! the<br/>women were wonderful. Carlington went on his knees to her. Told me<br/>so himself. She laughed at him, and there wasn't a girl in London<br/>at the time who wasn't after him. And by the way, Harry, talking<br/>about silly marriages, what is this humbug your father tells me<br/>about Dartmoor wanting to marry an American? Ain't English girls<br/>good enough for him?"<br/><br/>"It is rather fashionable to marry Americans just now, Uncle<br/>George."<br/><br/>"I'll back English women against the world, Harry," said Lord<br/>Fermor, striking the table with his fist.<br/><br/>"The betting is on the Americans."<br/>
