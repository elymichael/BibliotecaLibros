<br/>"Why?" said the younger man wearily.<br/><br/>"Because," said Lord Henry, passing beneath his nostrils the<br/>gilt trellis of an open vinaigrette box, "one can survive<br/>everything nowadays except that. Death and vulgarity are the only<br/>two facts in the nineteenth century that one cannot explain away.<br/>Let us have our coffee in the music-room, Dorian. You must play<br/>Chopin to me. The man with whom my wife ran away played Chopin<br/>exquisitely. Poor Victoria! I was very fond of her. The house is<br/>rather lonely without her. Of course, married life is merely a<br/>habit, a bad habit. But then one regrets the loss even of one's<br/>worst habits. Perhaps one regrets them the most. They are such an<br/>essential part of one's personality."<br/><br/>Dorian said nothing, but rose from the table, and passing into<br/>the next room, sat down to the piano and let his fingers stray<br/>across the white and black ivory of the keys. After the coffee had<br/>been brought in, he stopped, and looking over at Lord Henry, said,<br/>"Harry, did it ever occur to you that Basil was murdered?"<br/><br/>Lord Henry yawned. "Basil was very popular, and always wore a<br/>Waterbury watch. Why should he have been murdered? He was not<br/>clever enough to have enemies. Of course, he had a wonderful genius<br/>for painting. But a man can paint like Velasquez and yet be as dull<br/>as possible. Basil was really rather dull. He only interested me<br/>once, and that was when he told me, years ago, that he had a wild<br/>adoration for you and that you were the dominant motive of his<br/>art."<br/><br/>"I was very fond of Basil," said Dorian with a note of sadness<br/>in his voice. "But don't people say that he was murdered?"<br/><br/>"Oh, some of the papers do. It does not seem to me to be at all<br/>probable. I know there are dreadful places in Paris, but Basil was<br/>not the sort of man to have gone to them. He had no curiosity. It<br/>was his chief defect."<br/><br/>"What would you say, Harry, if I told you that I had murdered<br/>Basil?" said the younger man. He watched him intently after he had<br/>spoken.<br/><br/>"I would say, my dear fellow, that you were posing for a<br/>character that doesn't suit you. All crime is vulgar, just as all<br/>vulgarity is crime. It is not in you, Dorian, to commit a murder. I<br/>am sorry if I hurt your vanity by saying so, but I assure you it is<br/>true. Crime belongs exclusively to the lower orders. I don't blame<br/>them in the smallest degree. I should fancy that crime was to them<br/>what art is to us, simply a method of procuring extraordinary<br/>sensations."<br/><br/>"A method of procuring sensations? Do you think, then, that a<br/>man who has once committed a murder could possibly do the same<br/>crime again? Don't tell me that."<br/><br/>"Oh! anything becomes a pleasure if one does it too often,"<br/>cried Lord Henry, laughing. "That is one of the most important<br/>secrets of life. I should fancy, however, that murder is always a<br/>mistake. One should never do anything that one cannot talk about<br/>after dinner. But let us pass from poor Basil. I wish I could<br/>believe that he had come to such a really romantic end as you<br/>suggest, but I can't. I dare say he fell into the Seine off an<br/>omnibus and that the conductor hushed up the scandal. Yes: I should<br/>fancy that was his end. I see him lying now on his back under those<br/>dull-green waters, with the heavy barges floating over him and long<br/>weeds catching in his hair. Do you know, I don't think he would<br/>have done much more good work. During the last ten years his<br/>painting had gone off very much."<br/><br/>
