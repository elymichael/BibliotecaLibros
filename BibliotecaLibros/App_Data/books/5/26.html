"Great has been the pleasure, I am sure. I never met with a<br/>disposition more truly amiable."<br/><br/>"I have no doubt of it." And it was spoken with a sort of<br/>sighing animation, which had a vast deal of the lover. She was not<br/>less pleased another day with the manner in which he seconded a<br/>sudden wish of hers, to have Harriet's picture.<br/><br/>"Did you ever have your likeness taken, Harriet?" said she: "did<br/>you ever sit for your picture?"<br/><br/>Harriet was on the point of leaving the room, and only stopt to<br/>say, with a very interesting naivete,<br/><br/>"Oh! dear, no, never."<br/><br/>No sooner was she out of sight, than Emma exclaimed,<br/><br/>"What an exquisite possession a good picture of her would be! I<br/>would give any money for it. I almost long to attempt her likeness<br/>myself. You do not know it I dare say, but two or three years ago I<br/>had a great passion for taking likenesses, and attempted several of<br/>my friends, and was thought to have a tolerable eye in general. But<br/>from one cause or another, I gave it up in disgust. But really, I<br/>could almost venture, if Harriet would sit to me. It would be such<br/>a delight to have her picture!"<br/><br/>"Let me entreat you," cried Mr. Elton; "it would indeed be a<br/>delight! Let me entreat you, Miss Woodhouse, to exercise so<br/>charming a talent in favour of your friend. I know what your<br/>drawings are. How could you suppose me ignorant? Is not this room<br/>rich in specimens of your landscapes and flowers; and has not Mrs.<br/>Weston some inimitable figure-pieces in her drawing-room, at<br/>Randalls?"<br/><br/>Yes, good man!—thought Emma—but what has all that to do with<br/>taking likenesses? You know nothing of drawing. Don't pretend to be<br/>in raptures about mine. Keep your raptures for Harriet's face.<br/>"Well, if you give me such kind encouragement, Mr. Elton, I believe<br/>I shall try what I can do. Harriet's features are very delicate,<br/>which makes a likeness difficult; and yet there is a peculiarity in<br/>the shape of the eye and the lines about the mouth which one ought<br/>to catch."<br/><br/>"Exactly so—The shape of the eye and the lines about the mouth—I<br/>have not a doubt of your success. Pray, pray attempt it. As you<br/>will do it, it will indeed, to use your own words, be an exquisite<br/>possession."<br/><br/>"But I am afraid, Mr. Elton, Harriet will not like to sit. She<br/>thinks so little of her own beauty. Did not you observe her manner<br/>of answering me? How completely it meant, `why should my picture be<br/>drawn?'"<br/>
