Harriet slept at Hartfield that night. For some weeks past she
had been spending more than half her time there, and gradually
getting to have a bed-room appropriated to herself; and Emma judged
it best in every respect, safest and kindest, to keep her with them
as much as possible just at present. She was obliged to go the next
morning for an hour or two to Mrs. Goddard's, but it was then to be
settled that she should return to Hartfield, to make a regular
visit of some days.

While she was gone, Mr. Knightley called, and sat some time with
Mr. Woodhouse and Emma, till Mr. Woodhouse, who had previously made
up his mind to walk out, was persuaded by his daughter not to defer
it, and was induced by the entreaties of both, though against the
scruples of his own civility, to leave Mr. Knightley for that
purpose. Mr. Knightley, who had nothing of ceremony about him, was
offering by his short, decided answers, an amusing contrast to the
protracted apologies and civil hesitations of the other.

"Well, I believe, if you will excuse me, Mr. Knightley, if you
will not consider me as doing a very rude thing, I shall take
Emma's advice and go out for a quarter of an hour. As the sun is
out, I believe I had better take my three turns while I can. I
treat you without ceremony, Mr. Knightley. We invalids think we are
privileged people."

"My dear sir, do not make a stranger of me."

"I leave an excellent substitute in my daughter. Emma will be
happy to entertain you. And therefore I think I will beg your
excuse and take my three turns—my winter walk."

"You cannot do better, sir."
