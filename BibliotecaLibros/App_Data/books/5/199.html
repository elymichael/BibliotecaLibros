Mrs. Elton was spoken of. "I think she must be here soon," said<br/>he. "I have a great curiosity to see Mrs. Elton, I have heard so<br/>much of her. It cannot be long, I think, before she comes."<br/><br/>A carriage was heard. He was on the move immediately; but coming<br/>back, said,<br/><br/>"I am forgetting that I am not acquainted with her. I have never<br/>seen either Mr. or Mrs. Elton. I have no business to put myself<br/>forward."<br/><br/>Mr. and Mrs. Elton appeared; and all the smiles and the<br/>proprieties passed.<br/><br/>"But Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax!" said Mr. Weston, looking<br/>about. "We thought you were to bring them."<br/><br/>The mistake had been slight. The carriage was sent for them now.<br/>Emma longed to know what Frank's first opinion of Mrs. Elton might<br/>be; how he was affected by the studied elegance of her dress, and<br/>her smiles of graciousness. He was immediately qualifying himself<br/>to form an opinion, by giving her very proper attention, after the<br/>introduction had passed.<br/><br/>In a few minutes the carriage returned.—Somebody talked of<br/>rain.— "I will see that there are umbrellas, sir," said Frank to<br/>his father: "Miss Bates must not be forgotten:" and away he went.<br/>Mr. Weston was following; but Mrs. Elton detained him, to gratify<br/>him by her opinion of his son; and so briskly did she begin, that<br/>the young man himself, though by no means moving slowly, could<br/>hardly be out of hearing.<br/><br/>"A very fine young man indeed, Mr. Weston. You know I candidly<br/>told you I should form my own opinion; and I am happy to say that I<br/>am extremely pleased with him.—You may believe me. I never<br/>compliment. I think him a very handsome young man, and his manners<br/>are precisely what I like and approve—so truly the gentleman,<br/>without the least conceit or puppyism. You must know I have a vast<br/>dislike to puppies— quite a horror of them. They were never<br/>tolerated at Maple Grove. Neither Mr. Suckling nor me had ever any<br/>patience with them; and we used sometimes to say very cutting<br/>things! Selina, who is mild almost to a fault, bore with them much<br/>better."<br/><br/>While she talked of his son, Mr. Weston's attention was chained;<br/>but when she got to Maple Grove, he could recollect that there were<br/>ladies just arriving to be attended to, and with happy smiles must<br/>hurry away.<br/><br/>Mrs. Elton turned to Mrs. Weston. "I have no doubt of its being<br/>our carriage with Miss Bates and Jane. Our coachman and horses are<br/>so extremely expeditious!—I believe we drive faster than any body.—<br/>What a pleasure it is to send one's carriage for a friend!— I<br/>understand you were so kind as to offer, but another time it will<br/>be quite unnecessary. You may be very sure I shall always take care<br/>of them."<br/><br/>Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax, escorted by the two gentlemen,<br/>walked into the room; and Mrs. Elton seemed to think it as much her<br/>duty as Mrs. Weston's to receive them. Her gestures and movements<br/>might be understood by any one who looked on like Emma; but her<br/>words, every body's words, were soon lost under the incessant flow<br/>of Miss Bates, who came in talking, and had not finished her speech<br/>under many minutes after her being admitted into the circle at the<br/>fire. As the door opened she was heard,<br/>
