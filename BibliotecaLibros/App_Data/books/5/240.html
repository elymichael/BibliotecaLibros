To guess what all this meant, was impossible even for Emma.<br/>Something really important seemed announced by his looks; but, as<br/>her friend was well, she endeavoured not to be uneasy, and settling<br/>it with her father, that she would take her walk now, she and Mr.<br/>Weston were soon out of the house together and on their way at a<br/>quick pace for Randalls.<br/><br/>"Now,"—said Emma, when they were fairly beyond the sweep gates,—<br/>"now Mr. Weston, do let me know what has happened."<br/><br/>"No, no,"—he gravely replied.—"Don't ask me. I promised my wife<br/>to leave it all to her. She will break it to you better than I can.<br/>Do not be impatient, Emma; it will all come out too soon."<br/><br/>"Break it to me," cried Emma, standing still with terror.— "Good<br/>God!—Mr. Weston, tell me at once.—Something has happened in<br/>Brunswick Square. I know it has. Tell me, I charge you tell me this<br/>moment what it is."<br/><br/>"No, indeed you are mistaken."—<br/><br/>"Mr. Weston do not trifle with me.—Consider how many of my<br/>dearest friends are now in Brunswick Square. Which of them is it?—<br/>I charge you by all that is sacred, not to attempt<br/>concealment."<br/><br/>"Upon my word, Emma."—<br/><br/>"Your word!—why not your honour!—why not say upon your honour,<br/>that it has nothing to do with any of them? Good Heavens!—What can<br/>be to be broke to me, that does not relate to one of that<br/>family?"<br/><br/>"Upon my honour," said he very seriously, "it does not. It is<br/>not in the smallest degree connected with any human being of the<br/>name of Knightley."<br/><br/>Emma's courage returned, and she walked on.<br/><br/>"I was wrong," he continued, "in talking of its being broke to<br/>you. I should not have used the expression. In fact, it does not<br/>concern you— it concerns only myself,—that is, we hope.—Humph!—In<br/>short, my dear Emma, there is no occasion to be so uneasy about it.<br/>I don't say that it is not a disagreeable business—but things might<br/>be much worse.—If we walk fast, we shall soon be at Randalls."<br/>
