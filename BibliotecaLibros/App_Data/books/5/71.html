"I am most happy to hear it—but only Jane Fairfax one knows to<br/>be so very accomplished and superior!—and exactly Emma's age."<br/><br/>This topic was discussed very happily, and others succeeded of<br/>similar moment, and passed away with similar harmony; but the<br/>evening did not close without a little return of agitation. The<br/>gruel came and supplied a great deal to be said—much praise and<br/>many comments— undoubting decision of its wholesomeness for every<br/>constitution, and pretty severe Philippics upon the many houses<br/>where it was never met with tolerable;—but, unfortunately, among<br/>the failures which the daughter had to instance, the most recent,<br/>and therefore most prominent, was in her own cook at South End, a<br/>young woman hired for the time, who never had been able to<br/>understand what she meant by a basin of nice smooth gruel, thin,<br/>but not too thin. Often as she had wished for and ordered it, she<br/>had never been able to get any thing tolerable. Here was a<br/>dangerous opening.<br/><br/>"Ah!" said Mr. Woodhouse, shaking his head and fixing his eyes<br/>on her with tender concern.—The ejaculation in Emma's ear<br/>expressed, "Ah! there is no end of the sad consequences of your<br/>going to South End. It does not bear talking of." And for a little<br/>while she hoped he would not talk of it, and that a silent<br/>rumination might suffice to restore him to the relish of his own<br/>smooth gruel. After an interval of some minutes, however, he began<br/>with,<br/><br/>"I shall always be very sorry that you went to the sea this<br/>autumn, instead of coming here."<br/><br/>"But why should you be sorry, sir?—I assure you, it did the<br/>children a great deal of good."<br/><br/>"And, moreover, if you must go to the sea, it had better not<br/>have been to South End. South End is an unhealthy place. Perry was<br/>surprized to hear you had fixed upon South End."<br/><br/>"I know there is such an idea with many people, but indeed it is<br/>quite a mistake, sir.—We all had our health perfectly well there,<br/>never found the least inconvenience from the mud; and Mr. Wingfield<br/>says it is entirely a mistake to suppose the place unhealthy; and I<br/>am sure he may be depended on, for he thoroughly understands the<br/>nature of the air, and his own brother and family have been there<br/>repeatedly."<br/><br/>"You should have gone to Cromer, my dear, if you went anywhere.—<br/>Perry was a week at Cromer once, and he holds it to be the best of<br/>all the sea-bathing places. A fine open sea, he says, and very pure<br/>air. And, by what I understand, you might have had lodgings there<br/>quite away from the sea—a quarter of a mile off—very comfortable.<br/>You should have consulted Perry."<br/><br/>"But, my dear sir, the difference of the journey;—only consider<br/>how great it would have been.—An hundred miles, perhaps, instead of<br/>forty."<br/><br/>"Ah! my dear, as Perry says, where health is at stake, nothing<br/>else should be considered; and if one is to travel, there is not<br/>much to chuse between forty miles and an hundred.—Better not move<br/>at all, better stay in London altogether than travel forty miles to<br/>get into a worse air. This is just what Perry said. It seemed to<br/>him a very ill-judged measure."<br/><br/>Emma's attempts to stop her father had been vain; and when he<br/>had reached such a point as this, she could not wonder at her<br/>brother-in-law's breaking out.<br/>
