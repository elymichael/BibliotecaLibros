Every invitation was successful. They were all disengaged and<br/>all happy.— The preparatory interest of this dinner, however, was<br/>not yet over. A circumstance rather unlucky occurred. The two<br/>eldest little Knightleys were engaged to pay their grandpapa and<br/>aunt a visit of some weeks in the spring, and their papa now<br/>proposed bringing them, and staying one whole day at<br/>Hartfield—which one day would be the very day of this party.—His<br/>professional engagements did not allow of his being put off, but<br/>both father and daughter were disturbed by its happening so. Mr.<br/>Woodhouse considered eight persons at dinner together as the utmost<br/>that his nerves could bear— and here would be a ninth—and Emma<br/>apprehended that it would be a ninth very much out of humour at not<br/>being able to come even to Hartfield for forty-eight hours without<br/>falling in with a dinner-party.<br/><br/>She comforted her father better than she could comfort herself,<br/>by representing that though he certainly would make them nine, yet<br/>he always said so little, that the increase of noise would be very<br/>immaterial. She thought it in reality a sad exchange for herself,<br/>to have him with his grave looks and reluctant conversation opposed<br/>to her instead of his brother.<br/><br/>The event was more favourable to Mr. Woodhouse than to Emma.<br/>John Knightley came; but Mr. Weston was unexpectedly summoned to<br/>town and must be absent on the very day. He might be able to join<br/>them in the evening, but certainly not to dinner. Mr. Woodhouse was<br/>quite at ease; and the seeing him so, with the arrival of the<br/>little boys and the philosophic composure of her brother on hearing<br/>his fate, removed the chief of even Emma's vexation.<br/><br/>The day came, the party were punctually assembled, and Mr. John<br/>Knightley seemed early to devote himself to the business of being<br/>agreeable. Instead of drawing his brother off to a window while<br/>they waited for dinner, he was talking to Miss Fairfax. Mrs. Elton,<br/>as elegant as lace and pearls could make her, he looked at in<br/>silence— wanting only to observe enough for Isabella's<br/>information—but Miss Fairfax was an old acquaintance and a quiet<br/>girl, and he could talk to her. He had met her before breakfast as<br/>he was returning from a walk with his little boys, when it had been<br/>just beginning to rain. It was natural to have some civil hopes on<br/>the subject, and he said,<br/><br/>"I hope you did not venture far, Miss Fairfax, this morning, or<br/>I am sure you must have been wet.—We scarcely got home in time. I<br/>hope you turned directly."<br/><br/>"I went only to the post-office," said she, "and reached home<br/>before the rain was much. It is my daily errand. I always fetch the<br/>letters when I am here. It saves trouble, and is a something to get<br/>me out. A walk before breakfast does me good."<br/><br/>"Not a walk in the rain, I should imagine."<br/><br/>"No, but it did not absolutely rain when I set out."<br/><br/>Mr. John Knightley smiled, and replied,<br/><br/>"That is to say, you chose to have your walk, for you were not<br/>six yards from your own door when I had the pleasure of meeting<br/>you; and Henry and John had seen more drops than they could count<br/>long before. The post-office has a great charm at one period of our<br/>lives. When you have lived to my age, you will begin to think<br/>letters are never worth going through the rain for."<br/><br/>There was a little blush, and then this answer,<br/>
