They arrived, the carriage turned, the step was let down, and<br/>Mr. Elton, spruce, black, and smiling, was with them instantly.<br/>Emma thought with pleasure of some change of subject. Mr. Elton was<br/>all obligation and cheerfulness; he was so very cheerful in his<br/>civilities indeed, that she began to think he must have received a<br/>different account of Harriet from what had reached her. She had<br/>sent while dressing, and the answer had been, "Much the same— not<br/>better."<br/><br/>"My report from Mrs. Goddard's," said she presently, "was not so<br/>pleasant as I had hoped—`Not better' was my answer."<br/><br/>His face lengthened immediately; and his voice was the voice of<br/>sentiment as he answered.<br/><br/>"Oh! no—I am grieved to find—I was on the point of telling you<br/>that when I called at Mrs. Goddard's door, which I did the very<br/>last thing before I returned to dress, I was told that Miss Smith<br/>was not better, by no means better, rather worse. Very much grieved<br/>and concerned— I had flattered myself that she must be better after<br/>such a cordial as I knew had been given her in the morning."<br/><br/>Emma smiled and answered—"My visit was of use to the nervous<br/>part of her complaint, I hope; but not even I can charm away a sore<br/>throat; it is a most severe cold indeed. Mr. Perry has been with<br/>her, as you probably heard."<br/><br/>"Yes—I imagined—that is—I did not—"<br/><br/>"He has been used to her in these complaints, and I hope<br/>to-morrow morning will bring us both a more comfortable report. But<br/>it is impossible not to feel uneasiness. Such a sad loss to our<br/>party to-day!"<br/><br/>"Dreadful!—Exactly so, indeed.—She will be missed every<br/>moment."<br/><br/>This was very proper; the sigh which accompanied it was really<br/>estimable; but it should have lasted longer. Emma was rather in<br/>dismay when only half a minute afterwards he began to speak of<br/>other things, and in a voice of the greatest alacrity and<br/>enjoyment.<br/><br/>"What an excellent device," said he, "the use of a sheepskin for<br/>carriages. How very comfortable they make it;—impossible to feel<br/>cold with such precautions. The contrivances of modern days indeed<br/>have rendered a gentleman's carriage perfectly complete. One is so<br/>fenced and guarded from the weather, that not a breath of air can<br/>find its way unpermitted. Weather becomes absolutely of no<br/>consequence. It is a very cold afternoon—but in this carriage we<br/>know nothing of the matter.—Ha! snows a little I see."<br/><br/>"Yes," said John Knightley, "and I think we shall have a good<br/>deal of it."<br/>
