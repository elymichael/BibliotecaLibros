"It is hotter to-day."

"Not to my feelings. I am perfectly comfortable to-day."

"You are comfortable because you are under command."

"Your command?—Yes."

"Perhaps I intended you to say so, but I meant self-command. You
had, somehow or other, broken bounds yesterday, and run away from
your own management; but to-day you are got back again—and as I
cannot be always with you, it is best to believe your temper under
your own command rather than mine."

"It comes to the same thing. I can have no self-command without
a motive. You order me, whether you speak or not. And you can be
always with me. You are always with me."

"Dating from three o'clock yesterday. My perpetual influence
could not begin earlier, or you would not have been so much out of
humour before."

"Three o'clock yesterday! That is your date. I thought I had
seen you first in February."

"Your gallantry is really unanswerable. But (lowering her
voice)— nobody speaks except ourselves, and it is rather too much
to be talking nonsense for the entertainment of seven silent
people."

"I say nothing of which I am ashamed," replied he, with lively
impudence. "I saw you first in February. Let every body on the Hill
hear me if they can. Let my accents swell to Mickleham on one side,
and Dorking on the other. I saw you first in February." And then
whispering— "Our companions are excessively stupid. What shall we
do to rouse them? Any nonsense will serve. They shall talk. Ladies
and gentlemen, I am ordered by Miss Woodhouse (who, wherever she
is, presides) to say, that she desires to know what you are all
thinking of?"

Some laughed, and answered good-humouredly. Miss Bates said a
great deal; Mrs. Elton swelled at the idea of Miss Woodhouse's
presiding; Mr. Knightley's answer was the most distinct.
