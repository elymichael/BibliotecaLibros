"A sore-throat!—I hope not infectious. I hope not of a putrid<br/>infectious sort. Has Perry seen her? Indeed you should take care of<br/>yourself as well as of your friend. Let me entreat you to run no<br/>risks. Why does not Perry see her?"<br/><br/>Emma, who was not really at all frightened herself,<br/>tranquillised this excess of apprehension by assurances of Mrs.<br/>Goddard's experience and care; but as there must still remain a<br/>degree of uneasiness which she could not wish to reason away, which<br/>she would rather feed and assist than not, she added soon<br/>afterwards—as if quite another subject,<br/><br/>"It is so cold, so very cold—and looks and feels so very much<br/>like snow, that if it were to any other place or with any other<br/>party, I should really try not to go out to-day—and dissuade my<br/>father from venturing; but as he has made up his mind, and does not<br/>seem to feel the cold himself, I do not like to interfere, as I<br/>know it would be so great a disappointment to Mr. and Mrs. Weston.<br/>But, upon my word, Mr. Elton, in your case, I should certainly<br/>excuse myself. You appear to me a little hoarse already, and when<br/>you consider what demand of voice and what fatigues to-morrow will<br/>bring, I think it would be no more than common prudence to stay at<br/>home and take care of yourself to-night."<br/><br/>Mr. Elton looked as if he did not very well know what answer to<br/>make; which was exactly the case; for though very much gratified by<br/>the kind care of such a fair lady, and not liking to resist any<br/>advice of her's, he had not really the least inclination to give up<br/>the visit;— but Emma, too eager and busy in her own previous<br/>conceptions and views to hear him impartially, or see him with<br/>clear vision, was very well satisfied with his muttering<br/>acknowledgment of its being "very cold, certainly very cold," and<br/>walked on, rejoicing in having extricated him from Randalls, and<br/>secured him the power of sending to inquire after Harriet every<br/>hour of the evening.<br/><br/>"You do quite right," said she;—"we will make your apologies to<br/>Mr. and Mrs. Weston."<br/><br/>But hardly had she so spoken, when she found her brother was<br/>civilly offering a seat in his carriage, if the weather were Mr.<br/>Elton's only objection, and Mr. Elton actually accepting the offer<br/>with much prompt satisfaction. It was a done thing; Mr. Elton was<br/>to go, and never had his broad handsome face expressed more<br/>pleasure than at this moment; never had his smile been stronger,<br/>nor his eyes more exulting than when he next looked at her.<br/><br/>"Well," said she to herself, "this is most strange!—After I had<br/>got him off so well, to chuse to go into company, and leave Harriet<br/>ill behind!—Most strange indeed!—But there is, I believe, in many<br/>men, especially single men, such an inclination— such a passion for<br/>dining out—a dinner engagement is so high in the class of their<br/>pleasures, their employments, their dignities, almost their duties,<br/>that any thing gives way to it—and this must be the case with Mr.<br/>Elton; a most valuable, amiable, pleasing young man undoubtedly,<br/>and very much in love with Harriet; but still, he cannot refuse an<br/>invitation, he must dine out wherever he is asked. What a strange<br/>thing love is! he can see ready wit in Harriet, but will not dine<br/>alone for her."<br/><br/>Soon afterwards Mr. Elton quitted them, and she could not but do<br/>him the justice of feeling that there was a great deal of sentiment<br/>in his manner of naming Harriet at parting; in the tone of his<br/>voice while assuring her that he should call at Mrs. Goddard's for<br/>news of her fair friend, the last thing before he prepared for the<br/>happiness of meeting her again, when he hoped to be able to give a<br/>better report; and he sighed and smiled himself off in a way that<br/>left the balance of approbation much in his favour.<br/><br/>After a few minutes of entire silence between them, John<br/>Knightley began with—<br/><br/>"I never in my life saw a man more intent on being agreeable<br/>than Mr. Elton. It is downright labour to him where ladies are<br/>concerned. With men he can be rational and unaffected, but when he<br/>has ladies to please, every feature works."<br/><br/>"Mr. Elton's manners are not perfect," replied Emma; "but where<br/>there is a wish to please, one ought to overlook, and one does<br/>overlook a great deal. Where a man does his best with only moderate<br/>powers, he will have the advantage over negligent superiority.<br/>There is such perfect good-temper and good-will in Mr. Elton as one<br/>cannot but value."<br/>
