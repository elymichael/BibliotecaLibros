<br/>"It is very natural. It is natural, and it is honourable.— Yes,<br/>honourable, I think, to chuse so well and so gratefully.— But that<br/>it will be a fortunate preference is more that I can promise. I do<br/>not advise you to give way to it, Harriet. I do not by any means<br/>engage for its being returned. Consider what you are about. Perhaps<br/>it will be wisest in you to check your feelings while you can: at<br/>any rate do not let them carry you far, unless you are persuaded of<br/>his liking you. Be observant of him. Let his behaviour be the guide<br/>of your sensations. I give you this caution now, because I shall<br/>never speak to you again on the subject. I am determined against<br/>all interference. Henceforward I know nothing of the matter. Let no<br/>name ever pass our lips. We were very wrong before; we will be<br/>cautious now.—He is your superior, no doubt, and there do seem<br/>objections and obstacles of a very serious nature; but yet,<br/>Harriet, more wonderful things have taken place, there have been<br/>matches of greater disparity. But take care of yourself. I would<br/>not have you too sanguine; though, however it may end, be assured<br/>your raising your thoughts to him, is a mark of good taste which I<br/>shall always know how to value."<br/><br/>Harriet kissed her hand in silent and submissive gratitude. Emma<br/>was very decided in thinking such an attachment no bad thing for<br/>her friend. Its tendency would be to raise and refine her mind— and<br/>it must be saving her from the danger of degradation.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
