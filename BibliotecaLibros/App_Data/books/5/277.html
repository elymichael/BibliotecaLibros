<br/>It was the answer to the communication of his intended marriage.<br/>Emma accepted it with a very eager hand, with an impatience all<br/>alive to know what he would say about it, and not at all checked by<br/>hearing that her friend was unmentioned.<br/><br/>"John enters like a brother into my happiness," continued Mr.<br/>Knightley, "but he is no complimenter; and though I well know him<br/>to have, likewise, a most brotherly affection for you, he is so far<br/>from making flourishes, that any other young woman might think him<br/>rather cool in her praise. But I am not afraid of your seeing what<br/>he writes."<br/><br/>"He writes like a sensible man," replied Emma, when she had read<br/>the letter. "I honour his sincerity. It is very plain that he<br/>considers the good fortune of the engagement as all on my side, but<br/>that he is not without hope of my growing, in time, as worthy of<br/>your affection, as you think me already. Had he said any thing to<br/>bear a different construction, I should not have believed him."<br/><br/>"My Emma, he means no such thing. He only means—"<br/><br/>"He and I should differ very little in our estimation of the<br/>two," interrupted she, with a sort of serious smile—"much less,<br/>perhaps, than he is aware of, if we could enter without ceremony or<br/>reserve on the subject."<br/><br/>"Emma, my dear Emma—"<br/><br/>"Oh!" she cried with more thorough gaiety, "if you fancy your<br/>brother does not do me justice, only wait till my dear father is in<br/>the secret, and hear his opinion. Depend upon it, he will be much<br/>farther from doing you justice. He will think all the happiness,<br/>all the advantage, on your side of the question; all the merit on<br/>mine. I wish I may not sink into `poor Emma' with him at once.— His<br/>tender compassion towards oppressed worth can go no farther."<br/><br/>"Ah!" he cried, "I wish your father might be half as easily<br/>convinced as John will be, of our having every right that equal<br/>worth can give, to be happy together. I am amused by one part of<br/>John's letter— did you notice it?—where he says, that my<br/>information did not take him wholly by surprize, that he was rather<br/>in expectation of hearing something of the kind."<br/><br/>"If I understand your brother, he only means so far as your<br/>having some thoughts of marrying. He had no idea of me. He seems<br/>perfectly unprepared for that."<br/><br/>"Yes, yes—but I am amused that he should have seen so far into<br/>my feelings. What has he been judging by?—I am not conscious of any<br/>difference in my spirits or conversation that could prepare him at<br/>this time for my marrying any more than at another.— But it was so,<br/>I suppose. I dare say there was a difference when I was staying<br/>with them the other day. I believe I did not play with the children<br/>quite so much as usual. I remember one evening the poor boys<br/>saying, `Uncle seems always tired now.'"<br/><br/>
