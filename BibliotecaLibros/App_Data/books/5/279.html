It was an alarming change; and Emma was thinking<br/>of it one morning, as what must bring a great deal to agitate and<br/>grieve her, when Mr. Knightley came in, and distressing thoughts<br/>were put by.

You are<br/>trying not to smile."<br/><br/>"I am afraid," said he, composing his features, "I am very much<br/>afraid, my dear Emma, that you will not smile when you hear<br/>it."<br/><br/>
