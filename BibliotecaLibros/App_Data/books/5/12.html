<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>2<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>Mr. Weston was a native of Highbury, and born of a respectable<br/>family, which for the last two or three generations had been rising<br/>into gentility and property. He had received a good education, but,<br/>on succeeding early in life to a small independence, had become<br/>indisposed for any of the more homely pursuits in which his<br/>brothers were engaged, and had satisfied an active, cheerful mind<br/>and social temper by entering into the militia of his county, then<br/>embodied.<br/><br/>Captain Weston was a general favourite; and when the chances of<br/>his military life had introduced him to Miss Churchill, of a great<br/>Yorkshire family, and Miss Churchill fell in love with him, nobody<br/>was surprized, except her brother and his wife, who had never seen<br/>him, and who were full of pride and importance, which the connexion<br/>would offend.<br/><br/>Miss Churchill, however, being of age, and with the full command<br/>of her fortune—though her fortune bore no proportion to the<br/>family-estate—was not to be dissuaded from the marriage, and it<br/>took place, to the infinite mortification of Mr. and Mrs.<br/>Churchill, who threw her off with due decorum. It was an unsuitable<br/>connexion, and did not produce much happiness. Mrs. Weston ought to<br/>have found more in it, for she had a husband whose warm heart and<br/>sweet temper made him think every thing due to her in return for<br/>the great goodness of being in love with him; but though she had<br/>one sort of spirit, she had not the best. She had resolution enough<br/>to pursue her own will in spite of her brother, but not enough to<br/>refrain from unreasonable regrets at that brother's unreasonable<br/>anger, nor from missing the luxuries of her former home. They lived<br/>beyond their income, but still it was nothing in comparison of<br/>Enscombe: she did not cease to love her husband, but she wanted at<br/>once to be the wife of Captain Weston, and Miss Churchill of<br/>Enscombe.<br/><br/>Captain Weston, who had been considered, especially by the<br/>Churchills, as making such an amazing match, was proved to have<br/>much the worst of the bargain; for when his wife died, after a<br/>three years' marriage, he was rather a poorer man than at first,<br/>and with a child to maintain. From the expense of the child,<br/>however, he was soon relieved. The boy had, with the additional<br/>softening claim of a lingering illness of his mother's, been the<br/>means of a sort of reconciliation; and Mr. and Mrs. Churchill,<br/>having no children of their own, nor any other young creature of<br/>equal kindred to care for, offered to take the whole charge of the<br/>little Frank soon after her decease. Some scruples and some<br/>reluctance the widower-father may be supposed to have felt; but as<br/>they were overcome by other considerations, the child was given up<br/>to the care and the wealth of the Churchills, and he had only his<br/>own comfort to seek, and his own situation to improve as he<br/>could.<br/><br/>A complete change of life became desirable. He quitted the<br/>militia and engaged in trade, having brothers already established<br/>in a good way in London, which afforded him a favourable opening.<br/>It was a concern which brought just employment enough. He had still<br/>a small house in Highbury, where most of his leisure days were<br/>spent; and between useful occupation and the pleasures of society,<br/>the next eighteen or twenty years of his life passed cheerfully<br/>away. He had, by that time, realised an easy competence—enough to<br/>secure the purchase of a little estate adjoining Highbury, which he<br/>had always longed for—enough to marry a woman as portionless even<br/>as Miss Taylor, and to live according to the wishes of his own<br/>friendly and social disposition.<br/><br/>It was now some time since Miss Taylor had begun to influence<br/>his schemes; but as it was not the tyrannic influence of youth on<br/>youth, it had not shaken his determination of never settling till<br/>he could purchase Randalls, and the sale of Randalls was long<br/>looked forward to; but he had gone steadily on, with these objects<br/>in view, till they were accomplished. He had made his fortune,<br/>bought his house, and obtained his wife; and was beginning a new<br/>period of existence, with every probability of greater happiness<br/>than in any yet passed through. He had never been an unhappy man;<br/>his own temper had secured him from that, even in his first<br/>marriage; but his second must shew him how delightful a<br/>well-judging and truly amiable woman could be, and must give him<br/>the pleasantest proof of its being a great deal better to choose<br/>than to be chosen, to excite gratitude than to feel it.<br/><br/>
