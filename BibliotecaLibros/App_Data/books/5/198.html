<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>2<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>No misfortune occurred, again to prevent the ball. The day<br/>approached, the day arrived; and after a morning of some anxious<br/>watching, Frank Churchill, in all the certainty of his own self,<br/>reached Randalls before dinner, and every thing was safe.<br/><br/>No second meeting had there yet been between him and Emma. The<br/>room at the Crown was to witness it;—but it would be better than a<br/>common meeting in a crowd. Mr. Weston had been so very earnest in<br/>his entreaties for her arriving there as soon as possible after<br/>themselves, for the purpose of taking her opinion as to the<br/>propriety and comfort of the rooms before any other persons came,<br/>that she could not refuse him, and must therefore spend some quiet<br/>interval in the young man's company. She was to convey Harriet, and<br/>they drove to the Crown in good time, the Randalls party just<br/>sufficiently before them.<br/><br/>Frank Churchill seemed to have been on the watch; and though he<br/>did not say much, his eyes declared that he meant to have a<br/>delightful evening. They all walked about together, to see that<br/>every thing was as it should be; and within a few minutes were<br/>joined by the contents of another carriage, which Emma could not<br/>hear the sound of at first, without great surprize. "So<br/>unreasonably early!" she was going to exclaim; but she presently<br/>found that it was a family of old friends, who were coming, like<br/>herself, by particular desire, to help Mr. Weston's judgment; and<br/>they were so very closely followed by another carriage of cousins,<br/>who had been entreated to come early with the same distinguishing<br/>earnestness, on the same errand, that it seemed as if half the<br/>company might soon be collected together for the purpose of<br/>preparatory inspection.<br/><br/>Emma perceived that her taste was not the only taste on which<br/>Mr. Weston depended, and felt, that to be the favourite and<br/>intimate of a man who had so many intimates and confidantes, was<br/>not the very first distinction in the scale of vanity. She liked<br/>his open manners, but a little less of open-heartedness would have<br/>made him a higher character.—General benevolence, but not general<br/>friendship, made a man what he ought to be.— She could fancy such a<br/>man. The whole party walked about, and looked, and praised again;<br/>and then, having nothing else to do, formed a sort of half-circle<br/>round the fire, to observe in their various modes, till other<br/>subjects were started, that, though May, a fire in the evening was<br/>still very pleasant.<br/><br/>Emma found that it was not Mr. Weston's fault that the number of<br/>privy councillors was not yet larger. They had stopped at Mrs.<br/>Bates's door to offer the use of their carriage, but the aunt and<br/>niece were to be brought by the Eltons.<br/><br/>Frank was standing by her, but not steadily; there was a<br/>restlessness, which shewed a mind not at ease. He was looking<br/>about, he was going to the door, he was watching for the sound of<br/>other carriages,— impatient to begin, or afraid of being always<br/>near her.<br/><br/>
