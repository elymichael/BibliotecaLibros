"Oh! my dear sir, her throat is so much better that I have<br/>hardly any uneasiness about it. Either bathing has been of the<br/>greatest service to her, or else it is to be attributed to an<br/>excellent embrocation of Mr. Wingfield's, which we have been<br/>applying at times ever since August."<br/><br/>"It is not very likely, my dear, that bathing should have been<br/>of use to her—and if I had known you were wanting an embrocation, I<br/>would have spoken to—<br/><br/>"You seem to me to have forgotten Mrs. and Miss Bates," said<br/>Emma, "I have not heard one inquiry after them."<br/><br/>"Oh! the good Bateses—I am quite ashamed of myself—but you<br/>mention them in most of your letters. I hope they are quite well.<br/>Good old Mrs. Bates—I will call upon her to-morrow, and take my<br/>children.—They are always so pleased to see my children.— And that<br/>excellent Miss Bates!—such thorough worthy people!— How are they,<br/>sir?"<br/><br/>"Why, pretty well, my dear, upon the whole. But poor Mrs. Bates<br/>had a bad cold about a month ago."<br/><br/>"How sorry I am! But colds were never so prevalent as they have<br/>been this autumn. Mr. Wingfield told me that he has never known<br/>them more general or heavy—except when it has been quite an<br/>influenza."<br/><br/>"That has been a good deal the case, my dear; but not to the<br/>degree you mention. Perry says that colds have been very general,<br/>but not so heavy as he has very often known them in November. Perry<br/>does not call it altogether a sickly season."<br/><br/>"No, I do not know that Mr. Wingfield considers it very sickly<br/>except—<br/><br/>"Ah! my poor dear child, the truth is, that in London it is<br/>always a sickly season. Nobody is healthy in London, nobody can be.<br/>It is a dreadful thing to have you forced to live there! so far<br/>off!— and the air so bad!"<br/><br/>"No, indeed—we are not at all in a bad air. Our part of London<br/>is very superior to most others!—You must not confound us with<br/>London in general, my dear sir. The neighbourhood of Brunswick<br/>Square is very different from almost all the rest. We are so very<br/>airy! I should be unwilling, I own, to live in any other part of<br/>the town;— there is hardly any other that I could be satisfied to<br/>have my children in: but we are so remarkably airy!—Mr. Wingfield<br/>thinks the vicinity of Brunswick Square decidedly the most<br/>favourable as to air."<br/><br/>"Ah! my dear, it is not like Hartfield. You make the best of it—<br/>but after you have been a week at Hartfield, you are all of you<br/>different creatures; you do not look like the same. Now I cannot<br/>say, that I think you are any of you looking well at present."<br/>
