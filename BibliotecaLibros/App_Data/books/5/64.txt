"It would be very hard upon Mr. Weston if she did not, papa.—
You quite forget poor Mr. Weston."

"I think, indeed," said John Knightley pleasantly, "that Mr.
Weston has some little claim. You and I, Emma, will venture to take
the part of the poor husband. I, being a husband, and you not being
a wife, the claims of the man may very likely strike us with equal
force. As for Isabella, she has been married long enough to see the
convenience of putting all the Mr. Westons aside as much as she
can."

"Me, my love," cried his wife, hearing and understanding only in
part.— "Are you talking about me?—I am sure nobody ought to be, or
can be, a greater advocate for matrimony than I am; and if it had
not been for the misery of her leaving Hartfield, I should never
have thought of Miss Taylor but as the most fortunate woman in the
world; and as to slighting Mr. Weston, that excellent Mr. Weston, I
think there is nothing he does not deserve. I believe he is one of
the very best-tempered men that ever existed. Excepting yourself
and your brother, I do not know his equal for temper. I shall never
forget his flying Henry's kite for him that very windy day last
Easter—and ever since his particular kindness last September
twelvemonth in writing that note, at twelve o'clock at night, on
purpose to assure me that there was no scarlet fever at Cobham, I
have been convinced there could not be a more feeling heart nor a
better man in existence.—If any body can deserve him, it must be
Miss Taylor."

"Where is the young man?" said John Knightley. "Has he been here
on this occasion—or has he not?"

"He has not been here yet," replied Emma. "There was a strong
expectation of his coming soon after the marriage, but it ended in
nothing; and I have not heard him mentioned lately."

"But you should tell them of the letter, my dear," said her
father. "He wrote a letter to poor Mrs. Weston, to congratulate
her, and a very proper, handsome letter it was. She shewed it to
me. I thought it very well done of him indeed. Whether it was his
own idea you know, one cannot tell. He is but young, and his uncle,
perhaps—"

"My dear papa, he is three-and-twenty. You forget how time
passes."

"Three-and-twenty!—is he indeed?—Well, I could not have thought
it— and he was but two years old when he lost his poor mother!
Well, time does fly indeed!—and my memory is very bad. However, it
was an exceeding good, pretty letter, and gave Mr. and Mrs. Weston
a great deal of pleasure. I remember it was written from Weymouth,
and dated Sept. 28th—and began, `My dear Madam,' but I forget how
it went on; and it was signed `F. C. Weston Churchill.'— I remember
that perfectly."

"How very pleasing and proper of him!" cried the good-hearted
Mrs. John Knightley. "I have no doubt of his being a most amiable
young man. But how sad it is that he should not live at home with
his father! There is something so shocking in a child's being taken
away from his parents and natural home! I never could comprehend
how Mr. Weston could part with him. To give up one's child! I
really never could think well of any body who proposed such a thing
to any body else."

"Nobody ever did think well of the Churchills, I fancy,"
observed Mr. John Knightley coolly. "But you need not imagine Mr.
Weston to have felt what you would feel in giving up Henry or John.
Mr. Weston is rather an easy, cheerful-tempered man, than a man of
strong feelings; he takes things as he finds them, and makes
enjoyment of them somehow or other, depending, I suspect, much more
upon what is called society for his comforts, that is, upon the
power of eating and drinking, and playing whist with his neighbours
five times a week, than upon family affection, or any thing that
home affords."
