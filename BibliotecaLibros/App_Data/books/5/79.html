"We want only two more to be just the right number. I should<br/>like to see two more here,—your pretty little friend, Miss Smith,<br/>and my son—and then I should say we were quite complete. I believe<br/>you did not hear me telling the others in the drawing-room that we<br/>are expecting Frank. I had a letter from him this morning, and he<br/>will be with us within a fortnight."<br/><br/>Emma spoke with a very proper degree of pleasure; and fully<br/>assented to his proposition of Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Smith<br/>making their party quite complete.<br/><br/>"He has been wanting to come to us," continued Mr. Weston, "ever<br/>since September: every letter has been full of it; but he cannot<br/>command his own time. He has those to please who must be pleased,<br/>and who (between ourselves) are sometimes to be pleased only by a<br/>good many sacrifices. But now I have no doubt of seeing him here<br/>about the second week in January."<br/><br/>"What a very great pleasure it will be to you! and Mrs. Weston<br/>is so anxious to be acquainted with him, that she must be almost as<br/>happy as yourself."<br/><br/>"Yes, she would be, but that she thinks there will be another<br/>put-off. She does not depend upon his coming so much as I do: but<br/>she does not know the parties so well as I do. The case, you see,<br/>is—(but this is quite between ourselves: I did not mention a<br/>syllable of it in the other room. There are secrets in all<br/>families, you know)—The case is, that a party of friends are<br/>invited to pay a visit at Enscombe in January; and that Frank's<br/>coming depends upon their being put off. If they are not put off,<br/>he cannot stir. But I know they will, because it is a family that a<br/>certain lady, of some consequence, at Enscombe, has a particular<br/>dislike to: and though it is thought necessary to invite them once<br/>in two or three years, they always are put off when it comes to the<br/>point. I have not the smallest doubt of the issue. I am as<br/>confident of seeing Frank here before the middle of January, as I<br/>am of being here myself: but your good friend there (nodding<br/>towards the upper end of the table) has so few vagaries herself,<br/>and has been so little used to them at Hartfield, that she cannot<br/>calculate on their effects, as I have been long in the practice of<br/>doing."<br/><br/>"I am sorry there should be any thing like doubt in the case,"<br/>replied Emma; "but am disposed to side with you, Mr. Weston. If you<br/>think he will come, I shall think so too; for you know<br/>Enscombe."<br/><br/>"Yes—I have some right to that knowledge; though I have never<br/>been at the place in my life.—She is an odd woman!—But I never<br/>allow myself to speak ill of her, on Frank's account; for I do<br/>believe her to be very fond of him. I used to think she was not<br/>capable of being fond of any body, except herself: but she has<br/>always been kind to him (in her way—allowing for little whims and<br/>caprices, and expecting every thing to be as she likes). And it is<br/>no small credit, in my opinion, to him, that he should excite such<br/>an affection; for, though I would not say it to any body else, she<br/>has no more heart than a stone to people in general; and the devil<br/>of a temper."<br/><br/>Emma liked the subject so well, that she began upon it, to Mrs.<br/>Weston, very soon after their moving into the drawing-room: wishing<br/>her joy— yet observing, that she knew the first meeting must be<br/>rather alarming.— Mrs. Weston agreed to it; but added, that she<br/>should be very glad to be secure of undergoing the anxiety of a<br/>first meeting at the time talked of: "for I cannot depend upon his<br/>coming. I cannot be so sanguine as Mr. Weston. I am very much<br/>afraid that it will all end in nothing. Mr. Weston, I dare say, has<br/>been telling you exactly how the matter stands?"<br/><br/>"Yes—it seems to depend upon nothing but the ill-humour of Mrs.<br/>Churchill, which I imagine to be the most certain thing in the<br/>world."<br/><br/>"My Emma!" replied Mrs. Weston, smiling, "what is the certainty<br/>of caprice?" Then turning to Isabella, who had not been attending<br/>before—"You must know, my dear Mrs. Knightley, that we are by no<br/>means so sure of seeing Mr. Frank Churchill, in my opinion, as his<br/>father thinks. It depends entirely upon his aunt's spirits and<br/>pleasure; in short, upon her temper. To you—to my two daughters—I<br/>may venture on the truth. Mrs. Churchill rules at Enscombe, and is<br/>a very odd-tempered woman; and his coming now, depends upon her<br/>being willing to spare him."<br/><br/>"Oh, Mrs. Churchill; every body knows Mrs. Churchill," replied<br/>Isabella: "and I am sure I never think of that poor young man<br/>without the greatest compassion. To be constantly living with an<br/>ill-tempered person, must be dreadful. It is what we happily have<br/>never known any thing of; but it must be a life of misery. What a<br/>blessing, that she never had any children! Poor little creatures,<br/>how unhappy she would have made them!"<br/>
