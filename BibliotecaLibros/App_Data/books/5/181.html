The kind-hearted, polite old man might then sit down and feel<br/>that he had done his duty, and made every fair lady welcome and<br/>easy.<br/><br/>By this time, the walk in the rain had reached Mrs. Elton, and<br/>her remonstrances now opened upon Jane.<br/><br/>"My dear Jane, what is this I hear?—Going to the post-office in<br/>the rain!—This must not be, I assure you.—You sad girl, how could<br/>you do such a thing?—It is a sign I was not there to take care of<br/>you."<br/><br/>Jane very patiently assured her that she had not caught any<br/>cold.<br/><br/>"Oh! do not tell me. You really are a very sad girl, and do not<br/>know how to take care of yourself.—To the post-office indeed! Mrs.<br/>Weston, did you ever hear the like? You and I must positively exert<br/>our authority."<br/><br/>"My advice," said Mrs. Weston kindly and persuasively, "I<br/>certainly do feel tempted to give. Miss Fairfax, you must not run<br/>such risks.— Liable as you have been to severe colds, indeed you<br/>ought to be particularly careful, especially at this time of year.<br/>The spring I always think requires more than common care. Better<br/>wait an hour or two, or even half a day for your letters, than run<br/>the risk of bringing on your cough again. Now do not you feel that<br/>you had? Yes, I am sure you are much too reasonable. You look as if<br/>you would not do such a thing again."<br/><br/>"Oh! she shall not do such a thing again," eagerly rejoined Mrs.<br/>Elton. "We will not allow her to do such a thing again:"— and<br/>nodding significantly—"there must be some arrangement made, there<br/>must indeed. I shall speak to Mr. E. The man who fetches our<br/>letters every morning (one of our men, I forget his name) shall<br/>inquire for yours too and bring them to you. That will obviate all<br/>difficulties you know; and from us I really think, my dear Jane,<br/>you can have no scruple to accept such an accommodation."<br/><br/>"You are extremely kind," said Jane; "but I cannot give up my<br/>early walk. I am advised to be out of doors as much as I can, I<br/>must walk somewhere, and the post-office is an object; and upon my<br/>word, I have scarcely ever had a bad morning before."<br/><br/>"My dear Jane, say no more about it. The thing is determined,<br/>that is (laughing affectedly) as far as I can presume to determine<br/>any thing without the concurrence of my lord and master. You know,<br/>Mrs. Weston, you and I must be cautious how we express ourselves.<br/>But I do flatter myself, my dear Jane, that my influence is not<br/>entirely worn out. If I meet with no insuperable difficulties<br/>therefore, consider that point as settled."<br/><br/>"Excuse me," said Jane earnestly, "I cannot by any means consent<br/>to such an arrangement, so needlessly troublesome to your servant.<br/>If the errand were not a pleasure to me, it could be done, as it<br/>always is when I am not here, by my grandmama's."<br/><br/>"Oh! my dear; but so much as Patty has to do!—And it is a<br/>kindness to employ our men."<br/>
