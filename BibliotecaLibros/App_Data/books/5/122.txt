"And now that I understand your question, I must pronounce it to
be a very unfair one. It is always the lady's right to decide on
the degree of acquaintance. Miss Fairfax must already have given
her account.— I shall not commit myself by claiming more than she
may chuse to allow."

"Upon my word! you answer as discreetly as she could do herself.
But her account of every thing leaves so much to be guessed, she is
so very reserved, so very unwilling to give the least information
about any body, that I really think you may say what you like of
your acquaintance with her."

"May I, indeed?—Then I will speak the truth, and nothing suits
me so well. I met her frequently at Weymouth. I had known the
Campbells a little in town; and at Weymouth we were very much in
the same set. Colonel Campbell is a very agreeable man, and Mrs.
Campbell a friendly, warm-hearted woman. I like them all."

"You know Miss Fairfax's situation in life, I conclude; what she
is destined to be?"

"Yes—(rather hesitatingly)—I believe I do."

"You get upon delicate subjects, Emma," said Mrs. Weston
smiling; "remember that I am here.—Mr. Frank Churchill hardly knows
what to say when you speak of Miss Fairfax's situation in life. I
will move a little farther off."

"I certainly do forget to think of her," said Emma, "as having
ever been any thing but my friend and my dearest friend."

He looked as if he fully understood and honoured such a
sentiment.

When the gloves were bought, and they had quitted the shop
again, "Did you ever hear the young lady we were speaking of,
play?" said Frank Churchill.

"Ever hear her!" repeated Emma. "You forget how much she belongs
to Highbury. I have heard her every year of our lives since we both
began. She plays charmingly."
