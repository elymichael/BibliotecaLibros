<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>8<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>Frank Churchill came back again; and if he kept his father's<br/>dinner waiting, it was not known at Hartfield; for Mrs. Weston was<br/>too anxious for his being a favourite with Mr. Woodhouse, to betray<br/>any imperfection which could be concealed.<br/><br/>He came back, had had his hair cut, and laughed at himself with<br/>a very good grace, but without seeming really at all ashamed of<br/>what he had done. He had no reason to wish his hair longer, to<br/>conceal any confusion of face; no reason to wish the money unspent,<br/>to improve his spirits. He was quite as undaunted and as lively as<br/>ever; and, after seeing him, Emma thus moralised to herself:—<br/><br/>"I do not know whether it ought to be so, but certainly silly<br/>things do cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in<br/>an impudent way. Wickedness is always wickedness, but folly is not<br/>always folly.—It depends upon the character of those who handle it.<br/>Mr. Knightley, he is not a trifling, silly young man. If he were,<br/>he would have done this differently. He would either have gloried<br/>in the achievement, or been ashamed of it. There would have been<br/>either the ostentation of a coxcomb, or the evasions of a mind too<br/>weak to defend its own vanities.—No, I am perfectly sure that he is<br/>not trifling or silly."<br/><br/>With Tuesday came the agreeable prospect of seeing him again,<br/>and for a longer time than hitherto; of judging of his general<br/>manners, and by inference, of the meaning of his manners towards<br/>herself; of guessing how soon it might be necessary for her to<br/>throw coldness into her air; and of fancying what the observations<br/>of all those might be, who were now seeing them together for the<br/>first time.<br/><br/>She meant to be very happy, in spite of the scene being laid at<br/>Mr. Cole's; and without being able to forget that among the<br/>failings of Mr. Elton, even in the days of his favour, none had<br/>disturbed her more than his propensity to dine with Mr. Cole.<br/><br/>Her father's comfort was amply secured, Mrs. Bates as well as<br/>Mrs. Goddard being able to come; and her last pleasing duty, before<br/>she left the house, was to pay her respects to them as they sat<br/>together after dinner; and while her father was fondly noticing the<br/>beauty of her dress, to make the two ladies all the amends in her<br/>power, by helping them to large slices of cake and full glasses of<br/>wine, for whatever unwilling self-denial his care of their<br/>constitution might have obliged them to practise during the<br/>meal.—She had provided a plentiful dinner for them; she wished she<br/>could know that they had been allowed to eat it.<br/><br/>
