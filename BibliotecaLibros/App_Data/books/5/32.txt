"I had no notion that he liked me so very much," said Harriet,
contemplating the letter. For a little while Emma persevered in her
silence; but beginning to apprehend the bewitching flattery of that
letter might be too powerful, she thought it best to say,

"I lay it down as a general rule, Harriet, that if a woman
doubts as to whether she should accept a man or not, she certainly
ought to refuse him. If she can hesitate as to `Yes,' she ought to
say `No' directly. It is not a state to be safely entered into with
doubtful feelings, with half a heart. I thought it my duty as a
friend, and older than yourself, to say thus much to you. But do
not imagine that I want to influence you."

"Oh! no, I am sure you are a great deal too kind to—but if you
would just advise me what I had best do—No, no, I do not mean
that—As you say, one's mind ought to be quite made up—One should
not be hesitating—It is a very serious thing.—It will be safer to
say `No,' perhaps.—Do you think I had better say `No?'"

"Not for the world," said Emma, smiling graciously, "would I
advise you either way. You must be the best judge of your own
happiness. If you prefer Mr. Martin to every other person; if you
think him the most agreeable man you have ever been in company
with, why should you hesitate? You blush, Harriet.—Does any body
else occur to you at this moment under such a definition? Harriet,
Harriet, do not deceive yourself; do not be run away with by
gratitude and compassion. At this moment whom are you thinking
of?"

The symptoms were favourable.—Instead of answering, Harriet
turned away confused, and stood thoughtfully by the fire; and
though the letter was still in her hand, it was now mechanically
twisted about without regard. Emma waited the result with
impatience, but not without strong hopes. At last, with some
hesitation, Harriet said—

"Miss Woodhouse, as you will not give me your opinion, I must do
as well as I can by myself; and I have now quite determined, and
really almost made up my mind—to refuse Mr. Martin. Do you think I
am right?"

"Perfectly, perfectly right, my dearest Harriet; you are doing
just what you ought. While you were at all in suspense I kept my
feelings to myself, but now that you are so completely decided I
have no hesitation in approving. Dear Harriet, I give myself joy of
this. It would have grieved me to lose your acquaintance, which
must have been the consequence of your marrying Mr. Martin. While
you were in the smallest degree wavering, I said nothing about it,
because I would not influence; but it would have been the loss of a
friend to me. I could not have visited Mrs. Robert Martin, of
Abbey-Mill Farm. Now I am secure of you for ever."

Harriet had not surmised her own danger, but the idea of it
struck her forcibly.

"You could not have visited me!" she cried, looking aghast. "No,
to be sure you could not; but I never thought of that before. That
would have been too dreadful!—What an escape!—Dear Miss Woodhouse,
I would not give up the pleasure and honour of being intimate with
you for any thing in the world."

"Indeed, Harriet, it would have been a severe pang to lose you;
but it must have been. You would have thrown yourself out of all
good society. I must have given you up."
