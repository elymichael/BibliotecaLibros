<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>15<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>This letter must make its way to Emma's feelings. She was<br/>obliged, in spite of her previous determination to the contrary, to<br/>do it all the justice that Mrs. Weston foretold. As soon as she<br/>came to her own name, it was irresistible; every line relating to<br/>herself was interesting, and almost every line agreeable; and when<br/>this charm ceased, the subject could still maintain itself, by the<br/>natural return of her former regard for the writer, and the very<br/>strong attraction which any picture of love must have for her at<br/>that moment. She never stopt till she had gone through the whole;<br/>and though it was impossible not to feel that he had been wrong,<br/>yet he had been less wrong than she had supposed—and he had<br/>suffered, and was very sorry—and he was so grateful to Mrs. Weston,<br/>and so much in love with Miss Fairfax, and she was so happy<br/>herself, that there was no being severe; and could he have entered<br/>the room, she must have shaken hands with him as heartily as<br/>ever.<br/><br/>She thought so well of the letter, that when Mr. Knightley came<br/>again, she desired him to read it. She was sure of Mrs. Weston's<br/>wishing it to be communicated; especially to one, who, like Mr.<br/>Knightley, had seen so much to blame in his conduct.<br/><br/>"I shall be very glad to look it over," said he; "but it seems<br/>long. I will take it home with me at night."<br/><br/>But that would not do. Mr. Weston was to call in the evening,<br/>and she must return it by him.<br/><br/>"I would rather be talking to you," he replied; "but as it seems<br/>a matter of justice, it shall be done."<br/><br/>He began—stopping, however, almost directly to say, "Had I been<br/>offered the sight of one of this gentleman's letters to his<br/>mother-in-law a few months ago, Emma, it would not have been taken<br/>with such indifference."<br/><br/>
