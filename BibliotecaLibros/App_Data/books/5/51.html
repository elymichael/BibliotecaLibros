<br/>—"The best of all. Granted;—for private enjoyment; and for<br/>private enjoyment keep them. They are not at all the less written<br/>you know, because you divide them. The couplet does not cease to<br/>be, nor does its meaning change. But take it away, and all<br/>appropriation ceases, and a very pretty gallant charade remains,<br/>fit for any collection. Depend upon it, he would not like to have<br/>his charade slighted, much better than his passion. A poet in love<br/>must be encouraged in both capacities, or neither. Give me the<br/>book, I will write it down, and then there can be no possible<br/>reflection on you."<br/><br/>Harriet submitted, though her mind could hardly separate the<br/>parts, so as to feel quite sure that her friend were not writing<br/>down a declaration of love. It seemed too precious an offering for<br/>any degree of publicity.<br/><br/>"I shall never let that book go out of my own hands," said<br/>she.<br/><br/>"Very well," replied Emma; "a most natural feeling; and the<br/>longer it lasts, the better I shall be pleased. But here is my<br/>father coming: you will not object to my reading the charade to<br/>him. It will be giving him so much pleasure! He loves any thing of<br/>the sort, and especially any thing that pays woman a compliment. He<br/>has the tenderest spirit of gallantry towards us all!—You must let<br/>me read it to him."<br/><br/>Harriet looked grave.<br/><br/>"My dear Harriet, you must not refine too much upon this<br/>charade.—You will betray your feelings improperly, if you are too<br/>conscious and too quick, and appear to affix more meaning, or even<br/>quite all the meaning which may be affixed to it. Do not be<br/>overpowered by such a little tribute of admiration. If he had been<br/>anxious for secrecy, he would not have left the paper while I was<br/>by; but he rather pushed it towards me than towards you. Do not let<br/>us be too solemn on the business. He has encouragement enough to<br/>proceed, without our sighing out our souls over this charade."<br/><br/>"Oh! no—I hope I shall not be ridiculous about it. Do as you<br/>please."<br/><br/>Mr. Woodhouse came in, and very soon led to the subject again,<br/>by the recurrence of his very frequent inquiry of "Well, my dears,<br/>how does your book go on?—Have you got any thing fresh?"<br/><br/>"Yes, papa; we have something to read you, something quite<br/>fresh. A piece of paper was found on the table this morning—(dropt,<br/>we suppose, by a fairy)—containing a very pretty charade, and we<br/>have just copied it in."<br/><br/>She read it to him, just as he liked to have any thing read,<br/>slowly and distinctly, and two or three times over, with<br/>explanations of every part as she proceeded—and he was very much<br/>pleased, and, as she had foreseen, especially struck with the<br/>complimentary conclusion.<br/><br/>
