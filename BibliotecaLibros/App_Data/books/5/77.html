<br/>"Christmas weather," observed Mr. Elton. "Quite seasonable; and<br/>extremely fortunate we may think ourselves that it did not begin<br/>yesterday, and prevent this day's party, which it might very<br/>possibly have done, for Mr. Woodhouse would hardly have ventured<br/>had there been much snow on the ground; but now it is of no<br/>consequence. This is quite the season indeed for friendly meetings.<br/>At Christmas every body invites their friends about them, and<br/>people think little of even the worst weather. I was snowed up at a<br/>friend's house once for a week. Nothing could be pleasanter. I went<br/>for only one night, and could not get away till that very day<br/>se'nnight."<br/><br/>Mr. John Knightley looked as if he did not comprehend the<br/>pleasure, but said only, coolly,<br/><br/>"I cannot wish to be snowed up a week at Randalls."<br/><br/>At another time Emma might have been amused, but she was too<br/>much astonished now at Mr. Elton's spirits for other feelings.<br/>Harriet seemed quite forgotten in the expectation of a pleasant<br/>party.<br/><br/>"We are sure of excellent fires," continued he, "and every thing<br/>in the greatest comfort. Charming people, Mr. and Mrs. Weston;—<br/>Mrs. Weston indeed is much beyond praise, and he is exactly what<br/>one values, so hospitable, and so fond of society;— it will be a<br/>small party, but where small parties are select, they are perhaps<br/>the most agreeable of any. Mr. Weston's dining-room does not<br/>accommodate more than ten comfortably; and for my part, I would<br/>rather, under such circumstances, fall short by two than exceed by<br/>two. I think you will agree with me, (turning with a soft air to<br/>Emma,) I think I shall certainly have your approbation, though Mr.<br/>Knightley perhaps, from being used to the large parties of London,<br/>may not quite enter into our feelings."<br/><br/>"I know nothing of the large parties of London, sir—I never dine<br/>with any body."<br/><br/>"Indeed! (in a tone of wonder and pity,) I had no idea that the<br/>law had been so great a slavery. Well, sir, the time must come when<br/>you will be paid for all this, when you will have little labour and<br/>great enjoyment."<br/><br/>"My first enjoyment," replied John Knightley, as they passed<br/>through the sweep-gate, "will be to find myself safe at Hartfield<br/>again."<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
