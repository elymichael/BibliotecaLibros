"Yes," he replied, "any body may know how highly I think of
her."

"And yet," said Emma, beginning hastily and with an arch look,
but soon stopping—it was better, however, to know the worst at
once— she hurried on—"And yet, perhaps, you may hardly be aware
yourself how highly it is. The extent of your admiration may take
you by surprize some day or other."

Mr. Knightley was hard at work upon the lower buttons of his
thick leather gaiters, and either the exertion of getting them
together, or some other cause, brought the colour into his face, as
he answered,

"Oh! are you there?—But you are miserably behindhand. Mr. Cole
gave me a hint of it six weeks ago."

He stopped.—Emma felt her foot pressed by Mrs. Weston, and did
not herself know what to think. In a moment he went on—

"That will never be, however, I can assure you. Miss Fairfax, I
dare say, would not have me if I were to ask her—and I am very sure
I shall never ask her."

Emma returned her friend's pressure with interest; and was
pleased enough to exclaim,

"You are not vain, Mr. Knightley. I will say that for you."

He seemed hardly to hear her; he was thoughtful—and in a manner
which shewed him not pleased, soon afterwards said,

"So you have been settling that I should marry Jane
Fairfax?"

"No indeed I have not. You have scolded me too much for
match-making, for me to presume to take such a liberty with you.
What I said just now, meant nothing. One says those sort of things,
of course, without any idea of a serious meaning. Oh! no, upon my
word I have not the smallest wish for your marrying Jane Fairfax or
Jane any body. You would not come in and sit with us in this
comfortable way, if you were married."
