The very day of Mr. Elton's going to London produced a fresh
occasion for Emma's services towards her friend. Harriet had been
at Hartfield, as usual, soon after breakfast; and, after a time,
had gone home to return again to dinner: she returned, and sooner
than had been talked of, and with an agitated, hurried look,
announcing something extraordinary to have happened which she was
longing to tell. Half a minute brought it all out. She had heard,
as soon as she got back to Mrs. Goddard's, that Mr. Martin had been
there an hour before, and finding she was not at home, nor
particularly expected, had left a little parcel for her from one of
his sisters, and gone away; and on opening this parcel, she had
actually found, besides the two songs which she had lent Elizabeth
to copy, a letter to herself; and this letter was from him, from
Mr. Martin, and contained a direct proposal of marriage. "Who could
have thought it? She was so surprized she did not know what to do.
Yes, quite a proposal of marriage; and a very good letter, at least
she thought so. And he wrote as if he really loved her very
much—but she did not know—and so, she was come as fast as she could
to ask Miss Woodhouse what she should do.—" Emma was half-ashamed
of her friend for seeming so pleased and so doubtful.

"Upon my word," she cried, "the young man is determined not to
lose any thing for want of asking. He will connect himself well if
he can."

"Will you read the letter?" cried Harriet. "Pray do. I'd rather
you would."

Emma was not sorry to be pressed. She read, and was surprized.
The style of the letter was much above her expectation. There were
not merely no grammatical errors, but as a composition it would not
have disgraced a gentleman; the language, though plain, was strong
and unaffected, and the sentiments it conveyed very much to the
credit of the writer. It was short, but expressed good sense, warm
attachment, liberality, propriety, even delicacy of feeling. She
paused over it, while Harriet stood anxiously watching for her
opinion, with a "Well, well," and was at last forced to add, "Is it
a good letter? or is it too short?"

"Yes, indeed, a very good letter," replied Emma rather
slowly—"so good a letter, Harriet, that every thing considered, I
think one of his sisters must have helped him. I can hardly imagine
the young man whom I saw talking with you the other day could
express himself so well, if left quite to his own powers, and yet
it is not the style of a woman; no, certainly, it is too strong and
concise; not diffuse enough for a woman. No doubt he is a sensible
man, and I suppose may have a natural talent for—thinks strongly
and clearly—and when he takes a pen in hand, his thoughts naturally
find proper words. It is so with some men. Yes, I understand the
sort of mind. Vigorous, decided, with sentiments to a certain
point, not coarse. A better written letter, Harriet (returning it,)
than I had expected."

"Well," said the still waiting Harriet;—"well—and—and what shall
I do?"
