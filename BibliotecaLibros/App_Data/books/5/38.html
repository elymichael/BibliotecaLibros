<br/>"Harriet may not consider every body tiresome that you<br/>would."<br/><br/>Emma knew this was too true for contradiction, and therefore<br/>said nothing. He presently added, with a smile,<br/><br/>"I do not pretend to fix on times or places, but I must tell you<br/>that I have good reason to believe your little friend will soon<br/>hear of something to her advantage."<br/><br/>"Indeed! how so? of what sort?"<br/><br/>"A very serious sort, I assure you;" still smiling.<br/><br/>"Very serious! I can think of but one thing—Who is in love with<br/>her? Who makes you their confidant?"<br/><br/>Emma was more than half in hopes of Mr. Elton's having dropt a<br/>hint. Mr. Knightley was a sort of general friend and adviser, and<br/>she knew Mr. Elton looked up to him.<br/><br/>"I have reason to think," he replied, "that Harriet Smith will<br/>soon have an offer of marriage, and from a most unexceptionable<br/>quarter:—Robert Martin is the man. Her visit to Abbey-Mill, this<br/>summer, seems to have done his business. He is desperately in love<br/>and means to marry her."<br/><br/>"He is very obliging," said Emma; "but is he sure that Harriet<br/>means to marry him?"<br/><br/>"Well, well, means to make her an offer then. Will that do? He<br/>came to the Abbey two evenings ago, on purpose to consult me about<br/>it. He knows I have a thorough regard for him and all his family,<br/>and, I believe, considers me as one of his best friends. He came to<br/>ask me whether I thought it would be imprudent in him to settle so<br/>early; whether I thought her too young: in short, whether I<br/>approved his choice altogether; having some apprehension perhaps of<br/>her being considered (especially since your making so much of her)<br/>as in a line of society above him. I was very much pleased with all<br/>that he said. I never hear better sense from any one than Robert<br/>Martin. He always speaks to the purpose; open, straightforward, and<br/>very well judging. He told me every thing; his circumstances and<br/>plans, and what they all proposed doing in the event of his<br/>marriage. He is an excellent young man, both as son and brother. I<br/>had no hesitation in advising him to marry. He proved to me that he<br/>could afford it; and that being the case, I was convinced he could<br/>not do better. I praised the fair lady too, and altogether sent him<br/>away very happy. If he had never esteemed my opinion before, he<br/>would have thought highly of me then; and, I dare say, left the<br/>house thinking me the best friend and counsellor man ever had. This<br/>happened the night before last. Now, as we may fairly suppose, he<br/>would not allow much time to pass before he spoke to the lady, and<br/>as he does not appear to have spoken yesterday, it is not unlikely<br/>that he should be at Mrs. Goddard's to-day; and she may be detained<br/>by a visitor, without thinking him at all a tiresome wretch."<br/><br/>
