"What do you say to Mrs. Dixon?"

"Mrs. Dixon! very true indeed. I had not thought of Mrs. Dixon.
She must know as well as her father, how acceptable an instrument
would be; and perhaps the mode of it, the mystery, the surprize, is
more like a young woman's scheme than an elderly man's. It is Mrs.
Dixon, I dare say. I told you that your suspicions would guide
mine."

"If so, you must extend your suspicions and comprehend Mr. Dixon
in them."

"Mr. Dixon.—Very well. Yes, I immediately perceive that it must
be the joint present of Mr. and Mrs. Dixon. We were speaking the
other day, you know, of his being so warm an admirer of her
performance."

"Yes, and what you told me on that head, confirmed an idea which
I had entertained before.—I do not mean to reflect upon the good
intentions of either Mr. Dixon or Miss Fairfax, but I cannot help
suspecting either that, after making his proposals to her friend,
he had the misfortune to fall in love with her, or that he became
conscious of a little attachment on her side. One might guess
twenty things without guessing exactly the right; but I am sure
there must be a particular cause for her chusing to come to
Highbury instead of going with the Campbells to Ireland. Here, she
must be leading a life of privation and penance; there it would
have been all enjoyment. As to the pretence of trying her native
air, I look upon that as a mere excuse.—In the summer it might have
passed; but what can any body's native air do for them in the
months of January, February, and March? Good fires and carriages
would be much more to the purpose in most cases of delicate health,
and I dare say in her's. I do not require you to adopt all my
suspicions, though you make so noble a profession of doing it, but
I honestly tell you what they are."

"And, upon my word, they have an air of great probability. Mr.
Dixon's preference of her music to her friend's, I can answer for
being very decided."

"And then, he saved her life. Did you ever hear of that?— A
water party; and by some accident she was falling overboard. He
caught her."

"He did. I was there—one of the party."

"Were you really?—Well!—But you observed nothing of course, for
it seems to be a new idea to you.—If I had been there, I think I
should have made some discoveries."

"I dare say you would; but I, simple I, saw nothing but the
fact, that Miss Fairfax was nearly dashed from the vessel and that
Mr. Dixon caught her.—It was the work of a moment. And though the
consequent shock and alarm was very great and much more
durable—indeed I believe it was half an hour before any of us were
comfortable again— yet that was too general a sensation for any
thing of peculiar anxiety to be observable. I do not mean to say,
however, that you might not have made discoveries."

The conversation was here interrupted. They were called on to
share in the awkwardness of a rather long interval between the
courses, and obliged to be as formal and as orderly as the others;
but when the table was again safely covered, when every corner dish
was placed exactly right, and occupation and ease were generally
restored, Emma said,
