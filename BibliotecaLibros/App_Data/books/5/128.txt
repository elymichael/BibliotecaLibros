Frank Churchill came back again; and if he kept his father's
dinner waiting, it was not known at Hartfield; for Mrs. Weston was
too anxious for his being a favourite with Mr. Woodhouse, to betray
any imperfection which could be concealed.

He came back, had had his hair cut, and laughed at himself with
a very good grace, but without seeming really at all ashamed of
what he had done. He had no reason to wish his hair longer, to
conceal any confusion of face; no reason to wish the money unspent,
to improve his spirits. He was quite as undaunted and as lively as
ever; and, after seeing him, Emma thus moralised to herself:—

"I do not know whether it ought to be so, but certainly silly
things do cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in
an impudent way. Wickedness is always wickedness, but folly is not
always folly.—It depends upon the character of those who handle it.
Mr. Knightley, he is not a trifling, silly young man. If he were,
he would have done this differently. He would either have gloried
in the achievement, or been ashamed of it. There would have been
either the ostentation of a coxcomb, or the evasions of a mind too
weak to defend its own vanities.—No, I am perfectly sure that he is
not trifling or silly."

With Tuesday came the agreeable prospect of seeing him again,
and for a longer time than hitherto; of judging of his general
manners, and by inference, of the meaning of his manners towards
herself; of guessing how soon it might be necessary for her to
throw coldness into her air; and of fancying what the observations
of all those might be, who were now seeing them together for the
first time.

She meant to be very happy, in spite of the scene being laid at
Mr. Cole's; and without being able to forget that among the
failings of Mr. Elton, even in the days of his favour, none had
disturbed her more than his propensity to dine with Mr. Cole.

Her father's comfort was amply secured, Mrs. Bates as well as
Mrs. Goddard being able to come; and her last pleasing duty, before
she left the house, was to pay her respects to them as they sat
together after dinner; and while her father was fondly noticing the
beauty of her dress, to make the two ladies all the amends in her
power, by helping them to large slices of cake and full glasses of
wine, for whatever unwilling self-denial his care of their
constitution might have obliged them to practise during the
meal.—She had provided a plentiful dinner for them; she wished she
could know that they had been allowed to eat it.
