<br/>"Very pretty, sir, upon my word; to send me on here, to be an<br/>encumbrance to my friends, so long before you vouchsafe to come!—<br/>But you knew what a dutiful creature you had to deal with. You knew<br/>I should not stir till my lord and master appeared.— Here have I<br/>been sitting this hour, giving these young ladies a sample of true<br/>conjugal obedience—for who can say, you know, how soon it may be<br/>wanted?"<br/><br/>Mr. Elton was so hot and tired, that all this wit seemed thrown<br/>away. His civilities to the other ladies must be paid; but his<br/>subsequent object was to lament over himself for the heat he was<br/>suffering, and the walk he had had for nothing.<br/><br/>"When I got to Donwell," said he, "Knightley could not be found.<br/>Very odd! very unaccountable! after the note I sent him this<br/>morning, and the message he returned, that he should certainly be<br/>at home till one."<br/><br/>"Donwell!" cried his wife.—"My dear Mr. E., you have not been to<br/>Donwell!—You mean the Crown; you come from the meeting at the<br/>Crown."<br/><br/>"No, no, that's to-morrow; and I particularly wanted to see<br/>Knightley to-day on that very account.—Such a dreadful broiling<br/>morning!— I went over the fields too—(speaking in a tone of great<br/>ill-usage,) which made it so much the worse. And then not to find<br/>him at home! I assure you I am not at all pleased. And no apology<br/>left, no message for me. The housekeeper declared she knew nothing<br/>of my being expected.— Very extraordinary!—And nobody knew at all<br/>which way he was gone. Perhaps to Hartfield, perhaps to the Abbey<br/>Mill, perhaps into his woods.— Miss Woodhouse, this is not like our<br/>friend Knightley!—Can you explain it?"<br/><br/>Emma amused herself by protesting that it was very<br/>extraordinary, indeed, and that she had not a syllable to say for<br/>him.<br/><br/>"I cannot imagine," said Mrs. Elton, (feeling the indignity as a<br/>wife ought to do,) "I cannot imagine how he could do such a thing<br/>by you, of all people in the world! The very last person whom one<br/>should expect to be forgotten!—My dear Mr. E., he must have left a<br/>message for you, I am sure he must.—Not even Knightley could be so<br/>very eccentric;— and his servants forgot it. Depend upon it, that<br/>was the case: and very likely to happen with the Donwell servants,<br/>who are all, I have often observed, extremely awkward and remiss.—I<br/>am sure I would not have such a creature as his Harry stand at our<br/>sideboard for any consideration. And as for Mrs. Hodges, Wright<br/>holds her very cheap indeed.—She promised Wright a receipt, and<br/>never sent it."<br/><br/>"I met William Larkins," continued Mr. Elton, "as I got near the<br/>house, and he told me I should not find his master at home, but I<br/>did not believe him.—William seemed rather out of humour. He did<br/>not know what was come to his master lately, he said, but he could<br/>hardly ever get the speech of him. I have nothing to do with<br/>William's wants, but it really is of very great importance that I<br/>should see Knightley to-day; and it becomes a matter, therefore, of<br/>very serious inconvenience that I should have had this hot walk to<br/>no purpose."<br/><br/>Emma felt that she could not do better than go home directly. In<br/>all probability she was at this very time waited for there; and Mr.<br/>Knightley might be preserved from sinking deeper in aggression<br/>towards Mr. Elton, if not towards William Larkins.<br/><br/>She was pleased, on taking leave, to find Miss Fairfax<br/>determined to attend her out of the room, to go with her even<br/>downstairs; it gave her an opportunity which she immediately made<br/>use of, to say,<br/><br/>
