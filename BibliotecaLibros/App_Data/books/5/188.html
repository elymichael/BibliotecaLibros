Mrs. Weston was most comfortably pleased on the occasion. Her<br/>looks and words had nothing to restrain them. She was happy, she<br/>knew she was happy, and knew she ought to be happy. Her<br/>congratulations were warm and open; but Emma could not speak so<br/>fluently. She was a little occupied in weighing her own feelings,<br/>and trying to understand the degree of her agitation, which she<br/>rather thought was considerable.<br/><br/>Mr. Weston, however, too eager to be very observant, too<br/>communicative to want others to talk, was very well satisfied with<br/>what she did say, and soon moved away to make the rest of his<br/>friends happy by a partial communication of what the whole room<br/>must have overheard already.<br/><br/>It was well that he took every body's joy for granted, or he<br/>might not have thought either Mr. Woodhouse or Mr. Knightley<br/>particularly delighted. They were the first entitled, after Mrs.<br/>Weston and Emma, to be made happy;â€”from them he would have<br/>proceeded to Miss Fairfax, but she was so deep in conversation with<br/>John Knightley, that it would have been too positive an<br/>interruption; and finding himself close to Mrs. Elton, and her<br/>attention disengaged, he necessarily began on the subject with<br/>her.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
