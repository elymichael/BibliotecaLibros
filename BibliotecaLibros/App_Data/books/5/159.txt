Alas! there was soon no leisure for quarrelling with Mr.
Knightley. Two days of joyful security were immediately followed by
the over-throw of every thing. A letter arrived from Mr. Churchill
to urge his nephew's instant return. Mrs. Churchill was unwell— far
too unwell to do without him; she had been in a very suffering
state (so said her husband) when writing to her nephew two days
before, though from her usual unwillingness to give pain, and
constant habit of never thinking of herself, she had not mentioned
it; but now she was too ill to trifle, and must entreat him to set
off for Enscombe without delay.

The substance of this letter was forwarded to Emma, in a note
from Mrs. Weston, instantly. As to his going, it was inevitable. He
must be gone within a few hours, though without feeling any real
alarm for his aunt, to lessen his repugnance. He knew her
illnesses; they never occurred but for her own convenience.

Mrs. Weston added, "that he could only allow himself time to
hurry to Highbury, after breakfast, and take leave of the few
friends there whom he could suppose to feel any interest in him;
and that he might be expected at Hartfield very soon."

This wretched note was the finale of Emma's breakfast. When once
it had been read, there was no doing any thing, but lament and
exclaim. The loss of the ball—the loss of the young man— and all
that the young man might be feeling!—It was too wretched!— Such a
delightful evening as it would have been!—Every body so happy! and
she and her partner the happiest!—"I said it would be so," was the
only consolation.

Her father's feelings were quite distinct. He thought
principally of Mrs. Churchill's illness, and wanted to know how she
was treated; and as for the ball, it was shocking to have dear Emma
disappointed; but they would all be safer at home.

Emma was ready for her visitor some time before he appeared; but
if this reflected at all upon his impatience, his sorrowful look
and total want of spirits when he did come might redeem him. He
felt the going away almost too much to speak of it. His dejection
was most evident. He sat really lost in thought for the first few
minutes; and when rousing himself, it was only to say,

"Of all horrid things, leave-taking is the worst."

"But you will come again," said Emma. "This will not be your
only visit to Randalls."

"Ah!—(shaking his head)—the uncertainty of when I may be able to
return!—I shall try for it with a zeal!—It will be the object of
all my thoughts and cares!—and if my uncle and aunt go to town this
spring—but I am afraid—they did not stir last spring— I am afraid
it is a custom gone for ever."

"Our poor ball must be quite given up."

"Ah! that ball!—why did we wait for any thing?—why not seize the
pleasure at once?—How often is happiness destroyed by preparation,
foolish preparation!—You told us it would be so.—Oh! Miss
Woodhouse, why are you always so right?"
