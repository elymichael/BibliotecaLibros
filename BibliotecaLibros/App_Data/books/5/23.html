<br/>"Pretty! say beautiful rather. Can you imagine any thing nearer<br/>perfect beauty than Emma altogether—face and figure?"<br/><br/>"I do not know what I could imagine, but I confess that I have<br/>seldom seen a face or figure more pleasing to me than hers. But I<br/>am a partial old friend."<br/><br/>"Such an eye!—the true hazle eye—and so brilliant! regular<br/>features, open countenance, with a complexion! oh! what a bloom of<br/>full health, and such a pretty height and size; such a firm and<br/>upright figure! There is health, not merely in her bloom, but in<br/>her air, her head, her glance. One hears sometimes of a child being<br/>`the picture of health;' now, Emma always gives me the idea of<br/>being the complete picture of grown-up health. She is loveliness<br/>itself. Mr. Knightley, is not she?"<br/><br/>"I have not a fault to find with her person," he replied. "I<br/>think her all you describe. I love to look at her; and I will add<br/>this praise, that I do not think her personally vain. Considering<br/>how very handsome she is, she appears to be little occupied with<br/>it; her vanity lies another way. Mrs. Weston, I am not to be talked<br/>out of my dislike of Harriet Smith, or my dread of its doing them<br/>both harm."<br/><br/>"And I, Mr. Knightley, am equally stout in my confidence of its<br/>not doing them any harm. With all dear Emma's little faults, she is<br/>an excellent creature. Where shall we see a better daughter, or a<br/>kinder sister, or a truer friend? No, no; she has qualities which<br/>may be trusted; she will never lead any one really wrong; she will<br/>make no lasting blunder; where Emma errs once, she is in the right<br/>a hundred times."<br/><br/>"Very well; I will not plague you any more. Emma shall be an<br/>angel, and I will keep my spleen to myself till Christmas brings<br/>John and Isabella. John loves Emma with a reasonable and therefore<br/>not a blind affection, and Isabella always thinks as he does;<br/>except when he is not quite frightened enough about the children. I<br/>am sure of having their opinions with me."<br/><br/>"I know that you all love her really too well to be unjust or<br/>unkind; but excuse me, Mr. Knightley, if I take the liberty (I<br/>consider myself, you know, as having somewhat of the privilege of<br/>speech that Emma's mother might have had) the liberty of hinting<br/>that I do not think any possible good can arise from Harriet<br/>Smith's intimacy being made a matter of much discussion among you.<br/>Pray excuse me; but supposing any little inconvenience may be<br/>apprehended from the intimacy, it cannot be expected that Emma,<br/>accountable to nobody but her father, who perfectly approves the<br/>acquaintance, should put an end to it, so long as it is a source of<br/>pleasure to herself. It has been so many years my province to give<br/>advice, that you cannot be surprized, Mr. Knightley, at this little<br/>remains of office."<br/><br/>"Not at all," cried he; "I am much obliged to you for it. It is<br/>very good advice, and it shall have a better fate than your advice<br/>has often found; for it shall be attended to."<br/><br/>"Mrs. John Knightley is easily alarmed, and might be made<br/>unhappy about her sister."<br/><br/>"Be satisfied," said he, "I will not raise any outcry. I will<br/>keep my ill-humour to myself. I have a very sincere interest in<br/>Emma. Isabella does not seem more my sister; has never excited a<br/>greater interest; perhaps hardly so great. There is an anxiety, a<br/>curiosity in what one feels for Emma. I wonder what will become of<br/>her!"<br/><br/>
