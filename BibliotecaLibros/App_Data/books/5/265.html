<br/>He did so, but very soon stopt again to say, "the pianoforte!<br/>Ah! That was the act of a very, very young man, one too young to<br/>consider whether the inconvenience of it might not very much exceed<br/>the pleasure. A boyish scheme, indeed!—I cannot comprehend a man's<br/>wishing to give a woman any proof of affection which he knows she<br/>would rather dispense with; and he did know that she would have<br/>prevented the instrument's coming if she could."<br/><br/>After this, he made some progress without any pause. Frank<br/>Churchill's confession of having behaved shamefully was the first<br/>thing to call for more than a word in passing.<br/><br/>"I perfectly agree with you, sir,"—was then his remark. "You did<br/>behave very shamefully. You never wrote a truer line." And having<br/>gone through what immediately followed of the basis of their<br/>disagreement, and his persisting to act in direct opposition to<br/>Jane Fairfax's sense of right, he made a fuller pause to say, "This<br/>is very bad.—He had induced her to place herself, for his sake, in<br/>a situation of extreme difficulty and uneasiness, and it should<br/>have been his first object to prevent her from suffering<br/>unnecessarily.—She must have had much more to contend with, in<br/>carrying on the correspondence, than he could. He should have<br/>respected even unreasonable scruples, had there been such; but hers<br/>were all reasonable. We must look to her one fault, and remember<br/>that she had done a wrong thing in consenting to the engagement, to<br/>bear that she should have been in such a state of punishment."<br/><br/>Emma knew that he was now getting to the Box Hill party, and<br/>grew uncomfortable. Her own behaviour had been so very improper!<br/>She was deeply ashamed, and a little afraid of his next look. It<br/>was all read, however, steadily, attentively, and without the<br/>smallest remark; and, excepting one momentary glance at her,<br/>instantly withdrawn, in the fear of giving pain—no remembrance of<br/>Box Hill seemed to exist.<br/><br/>"There is no saying much for the delicacy of our good friends,<br/>the Eltons," was his next observation.—"His feelings are natural.—<br/>What! actually resolve to break with him entirely!—She felt the<br/>engagement to be a source of repentance and misery to each— she<br/>dissolved it.—What a view this gives of her sense of his<br/>behaviour!—Well, he must be a most extraordinary—"<br/><br/>"Nay, nay, read on.—You will find how very much he suffers."<br/><br/>"I hope he does," replied Mr. Knightley coolly, and resuming the<br/>letter. "`Smallridge!'—What does this mean? What is all this?"<br/><br/>"She had engaged to go as governess to Mrs. Smallridge's<br/>children— a dear friend of Mrs. Elton's—a neighbour of Maple Grove;<br/>and, by the bye, I wonder how Mrs. Elton bears the<br/>disappointment?"<br/><br/>"Say nothing, my dear Emma, while you oblige me to read—not even<br/>of Mrs. Elton. Only one page more. I shall soon have done. What a<br/>letter the man writes!"<br/><br/>"I wish you would read it with a kinder spirit towards him."<br/><br/>
