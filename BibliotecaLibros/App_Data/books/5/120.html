<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>6<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>The next morning brought Mr. Frank Churchill again. He came with<br/>Mrs. Weston, to whom and to Highbury he seemed to take very<br/>cordially. He had been sitting with her, it appeared, most<br/>companionably at home, till her usual hour of exercise; and on<br/>being desired to chuse their walk, immediately fixed on<br/>Highbury.—"He did not doubt there being very pleasant walks in<br/>every direction, but if left to him, he should always chuse the<br/>same. Highbury, that airy, cheerful, happy-looking Highbury, would<br/>be his constant attraction."— Highbury, with Mrs. Weston, stood for<br/>Hartfield; and she trusted to its bearing the same construction<br/>with him. They walked thither directly.<br/><br/>Emma had hardly expected them: for Mr. Weston, who had called in<br/>for half a minute, in order to hear that his son was very handsome,<br/>knew nothing of their plans; and it was an agreeable surprize to<br/>her, therefore, to perceive them walking up to the house together,<br/>arm in arm. She was wanting to see him again, and especially to see<br/>him in company with Mrs. Weston, upon his behaviour to whom her<br/>opinion of him was to depend. If he were deficient there, nothing<br/>should make amends for it. But on seeing them together, she became<br/>perfectly satisfied. It was not merely in fine words or<br/>hyperbolical compliment that he paid his duty; nothing could be<br/>more proper or pleasing than his whole manner to her—nothing could<br/>more agreeably denote his wish of considering her as a friend and<br/>securing her affection. And there was time enough for Emma to form<br/>a reasonable judgment, as their visit included all the rest of the<br/>morning. They were all three walking about together for an hour or<br/>two— first round the shrubberies of Hartfield, and afterwards in<br/>Highbury. He was delighted with every thing; admired Hartfield<br/>sufficiently for Mr. Woodhouse's ear; and when their going farther<br/>was resolved on, confessed his wish to be made acquainted with the<br/>whole village, and found matter of commendation and interest much<br/>oftener than Emma could have supposed.<br/><br/>Some of the objects of his curiosity spoke very amiable<br/>feelings. He begged to be shewn the house which his father had<br/>lived in so long, and which had been the home of his father's<br/>father; and on recollecting that an old woman who had nursed him<br/>was still living, walked in quest of her cottage from one end of<br/>the street to the other; and though in some points of pursuit or<br/>observation there was no positive merit, they shewed, altogether, a<br/>good-will towards Highbury in general, which must be very like a<br/>merit to those he was with.<br/><br/>Emma watched and decided, that with such feelings as were now<br/>shewn, it could not be fairly supposed that he had been ever<br/>voluntarily absenting himself; that he had not been acting a part,<br/>or making a parade of insincere professions; and that Mr. Knightley<br/>certainly had not done him justice.<br/><br/>Their first pause was at the Crown Inn, an inconsiderable house,<br/>though the principal one of the sort, where a couple of pair of<br/>post-horses were kept, more for the convenience of the<br/>neighbourhood than from any run on the road; and his companions had<br/>not expected to be detained by any interest excited there; but in<br/>passing it they gave the history of the large room visibly added;<br/>it had been built many years ago for a ball-room, and while the<br/>neighbourhood had been in a particularly populous, dancing state,<br/>had been occasionally used as such;—but such brilliant days had<br/>long passed away, and now the highest purpose for which it was ever<br/>wanted was to accommodate a whist club established among the<br/>gentlemen and half-gentlemen of the place. He was immediately<br/>interested. Its character as a ball-room caught him; and instead of<br/>passing on, he stopt for several minutes at the two superior sashed<br/>windows which were open, to look in and contemplate its<br/>capabilities, and lament that its original purpose should have<br/>ceased. He saw no fault in the room, he would acknowledge none<br/>which they suggested. No, it was long enough, broad enough,<br/>handsome enough. It would hold the very number for comfort. They<br/>ought to have balls there at least every fortnight through the<br/>winter. Why had not Miss Woodhouse revived the former good old days<br/>of the room?—She who could do any thing in Highbury! The want of<br/>proper families in the place, and the conviction that none beyond<br/>the place and its immediate environs could be tempted to attend,<br/>were mentioned; but he was not satisfied. He could not be persuaded<br/>that so many good-looking houses as he saw around him, could not<br/>furnish numbers enough for such a meeting; and even when<br/>particulars were given and families described, he was still<br/>unwilling to admit that the inconvenience of such a mixture would<br/>be any thing, or that there would be the smallest difficulty in<br/>every body's returning into their proper place the next morning. He<br/>argued like a young man very much bent on dancing; and Emma was<br/>rather surprized to see the constitution of the Weston prevail so<br/>decidedly against the habits of the Churchills. He seemed to have<br/>all the life and spirit, cheerful feelings, and social inclinations<br/>of his father, and nothing of the pride or reserve of Enscombe. Of<br/>pride, indeed, there was, perhaps, scarcely enough; his<br/>indifference to a confusion of rank, bordered too much on<br/>inelegance of mind. He could be no judge, however, of the evil he<br/>was holding cheap. It was but an effusion of lively spirits.<br/><br/>At last he was persuaded to move on from the front of the Crown;<br/>and being now almost facing the house where the Bateses lodged,<br/>Emma recollected his intended visit the day before, and asked him<br/>if he had paid it.<br/><br/>
