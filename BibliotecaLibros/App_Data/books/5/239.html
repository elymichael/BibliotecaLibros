<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>10<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>One morning, about ten days after Mrs. Churchill's decease, Emma<br/>was called downstairs to Mr. Weston, who "could not stay five<br/>minutes, and wanted particularly to speak with her."— He met her at<br/>the parlour-door, and hardly asking her how she did, in the natural<br/>key of his voice, sunk it immediately, to say, unheard by her<br/>father,<br/><br/>"Can you come to Randalls at any time this morning?—Do, if it be<br/>possible. Mrs. Weston wants to see you. She must see you."<br/><br/>"Is she unwell?"<br/><br/>"No, no, not at all—only a little agitated. She would have<br/>ordered the carriage, and come to you, but she must see you alone,<br/>and that you know—(nodding towards her father)—Humph!—Can you<br/>come?"<br/><br/>"Certainly. This moment, if you please. It is impossible to<br/>refuse what you ask in such a way. But what can be the matter?— Is<br/>she really not ill?"<br/><br/>"Depend upon me—but ask no more questions. You will know it all<br/>in time. The most unaccountable business! But hush, hush!"<br/><br/>
