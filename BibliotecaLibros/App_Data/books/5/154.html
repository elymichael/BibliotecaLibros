"Sir," said Mr. Woodhouse, rather warmly, "you are very much<br/>mistaken if you suppose Mr. Perry to be that sort of character. Mr.<br/>Perry is extremely concerned when any of us are ill. But I do not<br/>understand how the room at the Crown can be safer for you than your<br/>father's house."<br/><br/>"From the very circumstance of its being larger, sir. We shall<br/>have no occasion to open the windows at all—not once the whole<br/>evening; and it is that dreadful habit of opening the windows,<br/>letting in cold air upon heated bodies, which (as you well know,<br/>sir) does the mischief."<br/><br/>"Open the windows!—but surely, Mr. Churchill, nobody would think<br/>of opening the windows at Randalls. Nobody could be so imprudent! I<br/>never heard of such a thing. Dancing with open windows!—I am sure,<br/>neither your father nor Mrs. Weston (poor Miss Taylor that was)<br/>would suffer it."<br/><br/>"Ah! sir—but a thoughtless young person will sometimes step<br/>behind a window-curtain, and throw up a sash, without its being<br/>suspected. I have often known it done myself."<br/><br/>"Have you indeed, sir?—Bless me! I never could have supposed it.<br/>But I live out of the world, and am often astonished at what I<br/>hear. However, this does make a difference; and, perhaps, when we<br/>come to talk it over—but these sort of things require a good deal<br/>of consideration. One cannot resolve upon them in a hurry. If Mr.<br/>and Mrs. Weston will be so obliging as to call here one morning, we<br/>may talk it over, and see what can be done."<br/><br/>"But, unfortunately, sir, my time is so limited—"<br/><br/>"Oh!" interrupted Emma, "there will be plenty of time for<br/>talking every thing over. There is no hurry at all. If it can be<br/>contrived to be at the Crown, papa, it will be very convenient for<br/>the horses. They will be so near their own stable."<br/><br/>"So they will, my dear. That is a great thing. Not that James<br/>ever complains; but it is right to spare our horses when we can. If<br/>I could be sure of the rooms being thoroughly aired—but is Mrs.<br/>Stokes to be trusted? I doubt it. I do not know her, even by<br/>sight."<br/><br/>"I can answer for every thing of that nature, sir, because it<br/>will be under Mrs. Weston's care. Mrs. Weston undertakes to direct<br/>the whole."<br/><br/>"There, papa!—Now you must be satisfied—Our own dear Mrs.<br/>Weston, who is carefulness itself. Do not you remember what Mr.<br/>Perry said, so many years ago, when I had the measles? `If Miss<br/>Taylor undertakes to wrap Miss Emma up, you need not have any<br/>fears, sir.' How often have I heard you speak of it as such a<br/>compliment to her!"<br/><br/>"Aye, very true. Mr. Perry did say so. I shall never forget it.<br/>Poor little Emma! You were very bad with the measles; that is, you<br/>would have been very bad, but for Perry's great attention. He came<br/>four times a day for a week. He said, from the first, it was a very<br/>good sort—which was our great comfort; but the measles are a<br/>dreadful complaint. I hope whenever poor Isabella's little ones<br/>have the measles, she will send for Perry."<br/>
