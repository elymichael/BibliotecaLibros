"It is hotter to-day."<br/><br/>"Not to my feelings. I am perfectly comfortable to-day."<br/><br/>"You are comfortable because you are under command."<br/><br/>"Your command?—Yes."<br/><br/>"Perhaps I intended you to say so, but I meant self-command. You<br/>had, somehow or other, broken bounds yesterday, and run away from<br/>your own management; but to-day you are got back again—and as I<br/>cannot be always with you, it is best to believe your temper under<br/>your own command rather than mine."<br/><br/>"It comes to the same thing. I can have no self-command without<br/>a motive. You order me, whether you speak or not. And you can be<br/>always with me. You are always with me."<br/><br/>"Dating from three o'clock yesterday. My perpetual influence<br/>could not begin earlier, or you would not have been so much out of<br/>humour before."<br/><br/>"Three o'clock yesterday! That is your date. I thought I had<br/>seen you first in February."<br/><br/>"Your gallantry is really unanswerable. But (lowering her<br/>voice)— nobody speaks except ourselves, and it is rather too much<br/>to be talking nonsense for the entertainment of seven silent<br/>people."<br/><br/>"I say nothing of which I am ashamed," replied he, with lively<br/>impudence. "I saw you first in February. Let every body on the Hill<br/>hear me if they can. Let my accents swell to Mickleham on one side,<br/>and Dorking on the other. I saw you first in February." And then<br/>whispering— "Our companions are excessively stupid. What shall we<br/>do to rouse them? Any nonsense will serve. They shall talk. Ladies<br/>and gentlemen, I am ordered by Miss Woodhouse (who, wherever she<br/>is, presides) to say, that she desires to know what you are all<br/>thinking of?"<br/><br/>Some laughed, and answered good-humouredly. Miss Bates said a<br/>great deal; Mrs. Elton swelled at the idea of Miss Woodhouse's<br/>presiding; Mr. Knightley's answer was the most distinct.<br/>
