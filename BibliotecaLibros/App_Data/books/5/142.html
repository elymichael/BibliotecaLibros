Mrs. Weston was disappointed.<br/><br/>"I thought you meant to go with me. They would be very much<br/>pleased."<br/><br/>"Me! I should be quite in the way. But, perhaps—I may be equally<br/>in the way here. Miss Woodhouse looks as if she did not want me. My<br/>aunt always sends me off when she is shopping. She says I fidget<br/>her to death; and Miss Woodhouse looks as if she could almost say<br/>the same. What am I to do?"<br/><br/>"I am here on no business of my own," said Emma; "I am only<br/>waiting for my friend. She will probably have soon done, and then<br/>we shall go home. But you had better go with Mrs. Weston and hear<br/>the instrument."<br/><br/>"Well—if you advise it.—But (with a smile) if Colonel Campbell<br/>should have employed a careless friend, and if it should prove to<br/>have an indifferent tone—what shall I say? I shall be no support to<br/>Mrs. Weston. She might do very well by herself. A disagreeable<br/>truth would be palatable through her lips, but I am the wretchedest<br/>being in the world at a civil falsehood."<br/><br/>"I do not believe any such thing," replied Emma.—"I am persuaded<br/>that you can be as insincere as your neighbours, when it is<br/>necessary; but there is no reason to suppose the instrument is<br/>indifferent. Quite otherwise indeed, if I understood Miss Fairfax's<br/>opinion last night."<br/><br/>"Do come with me," said Mrs. Weston, "if it be not very<br/>disagreeable to you. It need not detain us long. We will go to<br/>Hartfield afterwards. We will follow them to Hartfield. I really<br/>wish you to call with me. It will be felt so great an attention!<br/>and I always thought you meant it."<br/><br/>He could say no more; and with the hope of Hartfield to reward<br/>him, returned with Mrs. Weston to Mrs. Bates's door. Emma watched<br/>them in, and then joined Harriet at the interesting<br/>counter,—trying, with all the force of her own mind, to convince<br/>her that if she wanted plain muslin it was of no use to look at<br/>figured; and that a blue ribbon, be it ever so beautiful, would<br/>still never match her yellow pattern. At last it was all settled,<br/>even to the destination of the parcel.<br/><br/>"Should I send it to Mrs. Goddard's, ma'am?" asked Mrs. Ford.—<br/>"Yes—no—yes, to Mrs. Goddard's. Only my pattern gown is at<br/>Hartfield. No, you shall send it to Hartfield, if you please. But<br/>then, Mrs. Goddard will want to see it.—And I could take the<br/>pattern gown home any day. But I shall want the ribbon directly— so<br/>it had better go to Hartfield—at least the ribbon. You could make<br/>it into two parcels, Mrs. Ford, could not you?"<br/><br/>"It is not worth while, Harriet, to give Mrs. Ford the trouble<br/>of two parcels."<br/><br/>"No more it is."<br/>
