Emma's colour was heightened by this unjust praise; and with a<br/>smile, and shake of the head, which spoke much, she looked at Mr.<br/>Knightley.— It seemed as if there were an instantaneous impression<br/>in her favour, as if his eyes received the truth from her's, and<br/>all that had passed of good in her feelings were at once caught and<br/>honoured.— He looked at her with a glow of regard. She was warmly<br/>gratified— and in another moment still more so, by a little<br/>movement of more than common friendliness on his part.—He took her<br/>hand;— whether she had not herself made the first motion, she could<br/>not say— she might, perhaps, have rather offered it—but he took her<br/>hand, pressed it, and certainly was on the point of carrying it to<br/>his lips— when, from some fancy or other, he suddenly let it<br/>go.—Why he should feel such a scruple, why he should change his<br/>mind when it was all but done, she could not perceive.—He would<br/>have judged better, she thought, if he had not stopped.—The<br/>intention, however, was indubitable; and whether it was that his<br/>manners had in general so little gallantry, or however else it<br/>happened, but she thought nothing became him more.— It was with<br/>him, of so simple, yet so dignified a nature.— She could not but<br/>recall the attempt with great satisfaction. It spoke such perfect<br/>amity.—He left them immediately afterwards— gone in a moment. He<br/>always moved with the alertness of a mind which could neither be<br/>undecided nor dilatory, but now he seemed more sudden than usual in<br/>his disappearance.<br/><br/>Emma could not regret her having gone to Miss Bates, but she<br/>wished she had left her ten minutes earlier;—it would have been a<br/>great pleasure to talk over Jane Fairfax's situation with Mr.<br/>Knightley.— Neither would she regret that he should be going to<br/>Brunswick Square, for she knew how much his visit would be<br/>enjoyed—but it might have happened at a better time—and to have had<br/>longer notice of it, would have been pleasanter.—They parted<br/>thorough friends, however; she could not be deceived as to the<br/>meaning of his countenance, and his unfinished gallantry;—it was<br/>all done to assure her that she had fully recovered his good<br/>opinion.—He had been sitting with them half an hour, she found. It<br/>was a pity that she had not come back earlier!<br/><br/>In the hope of diverting her father's thoughts from the<br/>disagreeableness of Mr. Knightley's going to London; and going so<br/>suddenly; and going on horseback, which she knew would be all very<br/>bad; Emma communicated her news of Jane Fairfax, and her dependence<br/>on the effect was justified; it supplied a very useful check,—<br/>interested, without disturbing him. He had long made up his mind to<br/>Jane Fairfax's going out as governess, and could talk of it<br/>cheerfully, but Mr. Knightley's going to London had been an<br/>unexpected blow.<br/><br/>"I am very glad, indeed, my dear, to hear she is to be so<br/>comfortably settled. Mrs. Elton is very good-natured and agreeable,<br/>and I dare say her acquaintance are just what they ought to be. I<br/>hope it is a dry situation, and that her health will be taken good<br/>care of. It ought to be a first object, as I am sure poor Miss<br/>Taylor's always was with me. You know, my dear, she is going to be<br/>to this new lady what Miss Taylor was to us. And I hope she will be<br/>better off in one respect, and not be induced to go away after it<br/>has been her home so long."<br/><br/>The following day brought news from Richmond to throw every<br/>thing else into the background. An express arrived at Randalls to<br/>announce the death of Mrs. Churchill! Though her nephew had had no<br/>particular reason to hasten back on her account, she had not lived<br/>above six-and-thirty hours after his return. A sudden seizure of a<br/>different nature from any thing foreboded by her general state, had<br/>carried her off after a short struggle. The great Mrs. Churchill<br/>was no more.<br/><br/>It was felt as such things must be felt. Every body had a degree<br/>of gravity and sorrow; tenderness towards the departed, solicitude<br/>for the surviving friends; and, in a reasonable time, curiosity to<br/>know where she would be buried. Goldsmith tells us, that when<br/>lovely woman stoops to folly, she has nothing to do but to die; and<br/>when she stoops to be disagreeable, it is equally to be recommended<br/>as a clearer of ill-fame. Mrs. Churchill, after being disliked at<br/>least twenty-five years, was now spoken of with compassionate<br/>allowances. In one point she was fully justified. She had never<br/>been admitted before to be seriously ill. The event acquitted her<br/>of all the fancifulness, and all the selfishness of imaginary<br/>complaints.<br/><br/>"Poor Mrs. Churchill! no doubt she had been suffering a great<br/>deal: more than any body had ever supposed—and continual pain would<br/>try the temper. It was a sad event—a great shock—with all her<br/>faults, what would Mr. Churchill do without her? Mr. Churchill's<br/>loss would be dreadful indeed. Mr. Churchill would never get over<br/>it."— Even Mr. Weston shook his head, and looked solemn, and said,<br/>"Ah! poor woman, who would have thought it!" and resolved, that his<br/>mourning should be as handsome as possible; and his wife sat<br/>sighing and moralising over her broad hems with a commiseration and<br/>good sense, true and steady. How it would affect Frank was among<br/>the earliest thoughts of both. It was also a very early speculation<br/>with Emma. The character of Mrs. Churchill, the grief of her<br/>husband—her mind glanced over them both with awe and compassion—and<br/>then rested with lightened feelings on how Frank might be affected<br/>by the event, how benefited, how freed. She saw in a moment all the<br/>possible good. Now, an attachment to Harriet Smith would have<br/>nothing to encounter. Mr. Churchill, independent of his wife, was<br/>feared by nobody; an easy, guidable man, to be persuaded into any<br/>thing by his nephew. All that remained to be wished was, that the<br/>nephew should form the attachment, as, with all her goodwill in the<br/>cause, Emma could feel no certainty of its being already<br/>formed.<br/><br/>Harriet behaved extremely well on the occasion, with great<br/>self-command. What ever she might feel of brighter hope, she<br/>betrayed nothing. Emma was gratified, to observe such a proof in<br/>her of strengthened character, and refrained from any allusion that<br/>might endanger its maintenance. They spoke, therefore, of Mrs.<br/>Churchill's death with mutual forbearance.<br/><br/>Short letters from Frank were received at Randalls,<br/>communicating all that was immediately important of their state and<br/>plans. Mr. Churchill was better than could be expected; and their<br/>first removal, on the departure of the funeral for Yorkshire, was<br/>to be to the house of a very old friend in Windsor, to whom Mr.<br/>Churchill had been promising a visit the last ten years. At<br/>present, there was nothing to be done for Harriet; good wishes for<br/>the future were all that could yet be possible on Emma's side.<br/><br/>It was a more pressing concern to shew attention to Jane<br/>Fairfax, whose prospects were closing, while Harriet's opened, and<br/>whose engagements now allowed of no delay in any one at Highbury,<br/>who wished to shew her kindness—and with Emma it was grown into a<br/>first wish. She had scarcely a stronger regret than for her past<br/>coldness; and the person, whom she had been so many months<br/>neglecting, was now the very one on whom she would have lavished<br/>every distinction of regard or sympathy. She wanted to be of use to<br/>her; wanted to shew a value for her society, and testify respect<br/>and consideration. She resolved to prevail on her to spend a day at<br/>Hartfield. A note was written to urge it. The invitation was<br/>refused, and by a verbal message. "Miss Fairfax was not well enough<br/>to write;" and when Mr. Perry called at Hartfield, the same<br/>morning, it appeared that she was so much indisposed as to have<br/>been visited, though against her own consent, by himself, and that<br/>she was suffering under severe headaches, and a nervous fever to a<br/>degree, which made him doubt the possibility of her going to Mrs.<br/>Smallridge's at the time proposed. Her health seemed for the moment<br/>completely deranged— appetite quite gone—and though there were no<br/>absolutely alarming symptoms, nothing touching the pulmonary<br/>complaint, which was the standing apprehension of the family, Mr.<br/>Perry was uneasy about her. He thought she had undertaken more than<br/>she was equal to, and that she felt it so herself, though she would<br/>not own it. Her spirits seemed overcome. Her present home, he could<br/>not but observe, was unfavourable to a nervous disorder:— confined<br/>always to one room;—he could have wished it otherwise— and her good<br/>aunt, though his very old friend, he must acknowledge to be not the<br/>best companion for an invalid of that description. Her care and<br/>attention could not be questioned; they were, in fact, only too<br/>great. He very much feared that Miss Fairfax derived more evil than<br/>good from them. Emma listened with the warmest concern; grieved for<br/>her more and more, and looked around eager to discover some way of<br/>being useful. To take her—be it only an hour or two—from her aunt,<br/>to give her change of air and scene, and quiet rational<br/>conversation, even for an hour or two, might do her good; and the<br/>following morning she wrote again to say, in the most feeling<br/>language she could command, that she would call for her in the<br/>carriage at any hour that Jane would name— mentioning that she had<br/>Mr. Perry's decided opinion, in favour of such exercise for his<br/>patient. The answer was only in this short note:<br/><br/>"Miss Fairfax's compliments and thanks, but is quite unequal to<br/>any exercise."<br/>
