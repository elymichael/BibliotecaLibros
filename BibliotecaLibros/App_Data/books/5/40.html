<br/>"I cannot help wondering at your knowing so little of Emma as to<br/>say any such thing. What! think a farmer, (and with all his sense<br/>and all his merit Mr. Martin is nothing more,) a good match for my<br/>intimate friend! Not regret her leaving Highbury for the sake of<br/>marrying a man whom I could never admit as an acquaintance of my<br/>own! I wonder you should think it possible for me to have such<br/>feelings. I assure you mine are very different. I must think your<br/>statement by no means fair. You are not just to Harriet's claims.<br/>They would be estimated very differently by others as well as<br/>myself; Mr. Martin may be the richest of the two, but he is<br/>undoubtedly her inferior as to rank in society.—The sphere in which<br/>she moves is much above his.—It would be a degradation."<br/><br/>"A degradation to illegitimacy and ignorance, to be married to a<br/>respectable, intelligent gentleman-farmer!"<br/><br/>"As to the circumstances of her birth, though in a legal sense<br/>she may be called Nobody, it will not hold in common sense. She is<br/>not to pay for the offence of others, by being held below the level<br/>of those with whom she is brought up.—There can scarcely be a doubt<br/>that her father is a gentleman—and a gentleman of fortune.—Her<br/>allowance is very liberal; nothing has ever been grudged for her<br/>improvement or comfort.—That she is a gentleman's daughter, is<br/>indubitable to me; that she associates with gentlemen's daughters,<br/>no one, I apprehend, will deny.—She is superior to Mr. Robert<br/>Martin."<br/><br/>"Whoever might be her parents," said Mr. Knightley, "whoever may<br/>have had the charge of her, it does not appear to have been any<br/>part of their plan to introduce her into what you would call good<br/>society. After receiving a very indifferent education she is left<br/>in Mrs. Goddard's hands to shift as she can;—to move, in short, in<br/>Mrs. Goddard's line, to have Mrs. Goddard's acquaintance. Her<br/>friends evidently thought this good enough for her; and it was good<br/>enough. She desired nothing better herself. Till you chose to turn<br/>her into a friend, her mind had no distaste for her own set, nor<br/>any ambition beyond it. She was as happy as possible with the<br/>Martins in the summer. She had no sense of superiority then. If she<br/>has it now, you have given it. You have been no friend to Harriet<br/>Smith, Emma. Robert Martin would never have proceeded so far, if he<br/>had not felt persuaded of her not being disinclined to him. I know<br/>him well. He has too much real feeling to address any woman on the<br/>haphazard of selfish passion. And as to conceit, he is the farthest<br/>from it of any man I know. Depend upon it he had<br/>encouragement."<br/><br/>It was most convenient to Emma not to make a direct reply to<br/>this assertion; she chose rather to take up her own line of the<br/>subject again.<br/><br/>"You are a very warm friend to Mr. Martin; but, as I said<br/>before, are unjust to Harriet. Harriet's claims to marry well are<br/>not so contemptible as you represent them. She is not a clever<br/>girl, but she has better sense than you are aware of, and does not<br/>deserve to have her understanding spoken of so slightingly. Waiving<br/>that point, however, and supposing her to be, as you describe her,<br/>only pretty and good-natured, let me tell you, that in the degree<br/>she possesses them, they are not trivial recommendations to the<br/>world in general, for she is, in fact, a beautiful girl, and must<br/>be thought so by ninety-nine people out of an hundred; and till it<br/>appears that men are much more philosophic on the subject of beauty<br/>than they are generally supposed; till they do fall in love with<br/>well-informed minds instead of handsome faces, a girl, with such<br/>loveliness as Harriet, has a certainty of being admired and sought<br/>after, of having the power of chusing from among many, consequently<br/>a claim to be nice. Her good-nature, too, is not so very slight a<br/>claim, comprehending, as it does, real, thorough sweetness of<br/>temper and manner, a very humble opinion of herself, and a great<br/>readiness to be pleased with other people. I am very much mistaken<br/>if your sex in general would not think such beauty, and such<br/>temper, the highest claims a woman could possess."<br/><br/>"Upon my word, Emma, to hear you abusing the reason you have, is<br/>almost enough to make me think so too. Better be without sense,<br/>than misapply it as you do."<br/><br/>"To be sure!" cried she playfully. "I know that is the feeling<br/>of you all. I know that such a girl as Harriet is exactly what<br/>every man delights in—what at once bewitches his senses and<br/>satisfies his judgment. Oh! Harriet may pick and chuse. Were you,<br/>yourself, ever to marry, she is the very woman for you. And is she,<br/>at seventeen, just entering into life, just beginning to be known,<br/>to be wondered at because she does not accept the first offer she<br/>receives? No—pray let her have time to look about her."<br/><br/>"I have always thought it a very foolish intimacy," said Mr.<br/>Knightley presently, "though I have kept my thoughts to myself; but<br/>I now perceive that it will be a very unfortunate one for Harriet.<br/>You will puff her up with such ideas of her own beauty, and of what<br/>she has a claim to, that, in a little while, nobody within her<br/>reach will be good enough for her. Vanity working on a weak head,<br/>produces every sort of mischief. Nothing so easy as for a young<br/>lady to raise her expectations too high. Miss Harriet Smith may not<br/>find offers of marriage flow in so fast, though she is a very<br/>pretty girl. Men of sense, whatever you may chuse to say, do not<br/>want silly wives. Men of family would not be very fond of<br/>connecting themselves with a girl of such obscurity—and most<br/>prudent men would be afraid of the inconvenience and disgrace they<br/>might be involved in, when the mystery of her parentage came to be<br/>revealed. Let her marry Robert Martin, and she is safe,<br/>respectable, and happy for ever; but if you encourage her to expect<br/>to marry greatly, and teach her to be satisfied with nothing less<br/>than a man of consequence and large fortune, she may be a<br/>parlour-boarder at Mrs. Goddard's all the rest of her life—or, at<br/>least, (for Harriet Smith is a girl who will marry somebody or<br/>other,) till she grow desperate, and is glad to catch at the old<br/>writing-master's son."<br/><br/>"We think so very differently on this point, Mr. Knightley, that<br/>there can be no use in canvassing it. We shall only be making each<br/>other more angry. But as to my letting her marry Robert Martin, it<br/>is impossible; she has refused him, and so decidedly, I think, as<br/>must prevent any second application. She must abide by the evil of<br/>having refused him, whatever it may be; and as to the refusal<br/>itself, I will not pretend to say that I might not influence her a<br/>little; but I assure you there was very little for me or for any<br/>body to do. His appearance is so much against him, and his manner<br/>so bad, that if she ever were disposed to favour him, she is not<br/>now. I can imagine, that before she had seen any body superior, she<br/>might tolerate him. He was the brother of her friends, and he took<br/>pains to please her; and altogether, having seen nobody better<br/>(that must have been his great assistant) she might not, while she<br/>was at Abbey-Mill, find him disagreeable. But the case is altered<br/>now. She knows now what gentlemen are; and nothing but a gentleman<br/>in education and manner has any chance with Harriet."<br/><br/>
