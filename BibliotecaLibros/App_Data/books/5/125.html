<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>7<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>Emma's very good opinion of Frank Churchill was a little shaken<br/>the following day, by hearing that he was gone off to London,<br/>merely to have his hair cut. A sudden freak seemed to have seized<br/>him at breakfast, and he had sent for a chaise and set off,<br/>intending to return to dinner, but with no more important view that<br/>appeared than having his hair cut. There was certainly no harm in<br/>his travelling sixteen miles twice over on such an errand; but<br/>there was an air of foppery and nonsense in it which she could not<br/>approve. It did not accord with the rationality of plan, the<br/>moderation in expense, or even the unselfish warmth of heart, which<br/>she had believed herself to discern in him yesterday. Vanity,<br/>extravagance, love of change, restlessness of temper, which must be<br/>doing something, good or bad; heedlessness as to the pleasure of<br/>his father and Mrs. Weston, indifferent as to how his conduct might<br/>appear in general; he became liable to all these charges. His<br/>father only called him a coxcomb, and thought it a very good story;<br/>but that Mrs. Weston did not like it, was clear enough, by her<br/>passing it over as quickly as possible, and making no other comment<br/>than that "all young people would have their little whims."<br/><br/>With the exception of this little blot, Emma found that his<br/>visit hitherto had given her friend only good ideas of him. Mrs.<br/>Weston was very ready to say how attentive and pleasant a companion<br/>he made himself—how much she saw to like in his disposition<br/>altogether. He appeared to have a very open temper—certainly a very<br/>cheerful and lively one; she could observe nothing wrong in his<br/>notions, a great deal decidedly right; he spoke of his uncle with<br/>warm regard, was fond of talking of him—said he would be the best<br/>man in the world if he were left to himself; and though there was<br/>no being attached to the aunt, he acknowledged her kindness with<br/>gratitude, and seemed to mean always to speak of her with respect.<br/>This was all very promising; and, but for such an unfortunate fancy<br/>for having his hair cut, there was nothing to denote him unworthy<br/>of the distinguished honour which her imagination had given him;<br/>the honour, if not of being really in love with her, of being at<br/>least very near it, and saved only by her own indifference— (for<br/>still her resolution held of never marrying)—the honour, in short,<br/>of being marked out for her by all their joint acquaintance.<br/><br/>Mr. Weston, on his side, added a virtue to the account which<br/>must have some weight. He gave her to understand that Frank admired<br/>her extremely—thought her very beautiful and very charming; and<br/>with so much to be said for him altogether, she found she must not<br/>judge him harshly. As Mrs. Weston observed, "all young people would<br/>have their little whims."<br/><br/>There was one person among his new acquaintance in Surry, not so<br/>leniently disposed. In general he was judged, throughout the<br/>parishes of Donwell and Highbury, with great candour; liberal<br/>allowances were made for the little excesses of such a handsome<br/>young man— one who smiled so often and bowed so well; but there was<br/>one spirit among them not to be softened, from its power of<br/>censure, by bows or smiles—Mr. Knightley. The circumstance was told<br/>him at Hartfield; for the moment, he was silent; but Emma heard him<br/>almost immediately afterwards say to himself, over a newspaper he<br/>held in his hand, "Hum! just the trifling, silly fellow I took him<br/>for." She had half a mind to resent; but an instant's observation<br/>convinced her that it was really said only to relieve his own<br/>feelings, and not meant to provoke; and therefore she let it<br/>pass.<br/><br/>Although in one instance the bearers of not good tidings, Mr.<br/>and Mrs. Weston's visit this morning was in another respect<br/>particularly opportune. Something occurred while they were at<br/>Hartfield, to make Emma want their advice; and, which was still<br/>more lucky, she wanted exactly the advice they gave.<br/><br/>This was the occurrence:—The Coles had been settled some years<br/>in Highbury, and were very good sort of people—friendly, liberal,<br/>and unpretending; but, on the other hand, they were of low origin,<br/>in trade, and only moderately genteel. On their first coming into<br/>the country, they had lived in proportion to their income, quietly,<br/>keeping little company, and that little unexpensively; but the last<br/>year or two had brought them a considerable increase of means— the<br/>house in town had yielded greater profits, and fortune in general<br/>had smiled on them. With their wealth, their views increased; their<br/>want of a larger house, their inclination for more company. They<br/>added to their house, to their number of servants, to their<br/>expenses of every sort; and by this time were, in fortune and style<br/>of living, second only to the family at Hartfield. Their love of<br/>society, and their new dining-room, prepared every body for their<br/>keeping dinner-company; and a few parties, chiefly among the single<br/>men, had already taken place. The regular and best families Emma<br/>could hardly suppose they would presume to invite— neither Donwell,<br/>nor Hartfield, nor Randalls. Nothing should tempt her to go, if<br/>they did; and she regretted that her father's known habits would be<br/>giving her refusal less meaning than she could wish. The Coles were<br/>very respectable in their way, but they ought to be taught that it<br/>was not for them to arrange the terms on which the superior<br/>families would visit them. This lesson, she very much feared, they<br/>would receive only from herself; she had little hope of Mr.<br/>Knightley, none of Mr. Weston.<br/><br/>
