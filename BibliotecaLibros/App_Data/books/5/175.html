<br/>"She must have some motive, more powerful than appears, for<br/>refusing this invitation," was Emma's conclusion. "She must be<br/>under some sort of penance, inflicted either by the Campbells or<br/>herself. There is great fear, great caution, great resolution<br/>somewhere.— She is not to be with the Dixons. The decree is issued<br/>by somebody. But why must she consent to be with the Eltons?—Here<br/>is quite a separate puzzle."<br/><br/>Upon her speaking her wonder aloud on that part of the subject,<br/>before the few who knew her opinion of Mrs. Elton, Mrs. Weston<br/>ventured this apology for Jane.<br/><br/>"We cannot suppose that she has any great enjoyment at the<br/>Vicarage, my dear Emma—but it is better than being always at home.<br/>Her aunt is a good creature, but, as a constant companion, must be<br/>very tiresome. We must consider what Miss Fairfax quits, before we<br/>condemn her taste for what she goes to."<br/><br/>"You are right, Mrs. Weston," said Mr. Knightley warmly, "Miss<br/>Fairfax is as capable as any of us of forming a just opinion of<br/>Mrs. Elton. Could she have chosen with whom to associate, she would<br/>not have chosen her. But (with a reproachful smile at Emma) she<br/>receives attentions from Mrs. Elton, which nobody else pays<br/>her."<br/><br/>Emma felt that Mrs. Weston was giving her a momentary glance;<br/>and she was herself struck by his warmth. With a faint blush, she<br/>presently replied,<br/><br/>"Such attentions as Mrs. Elton's, I should have imagined, would<br/>rather disgust than gratify Miss Fairfax. Mrs. Elton's invitations<br/>I should have imagined any thing but inviting."<br/><br/>"I should not wonder," said Mrs. Weston, "if Miss Fairfax were<br/>to have been drawn on beyond her own inclination, by her aunt's<br/>eagerness in accepting Mrs. Elton's civilities for her. Poor Miss<br/>Bates may very likely have committed her niece and hurried her into<br/>a greater appearance of intimacy than her own good sense would have<br/>dictated, in spite of the very natural wish of a little<br/>change."<br/><br/>Both felt rather anxious to hear him speak again; and after a<br/>few minutes silence, he said,<br/><br/>"Another thing must be taken into consideration too—Mrs. Elton<br/>does not talk to Miss Fairfax as she speaks of her. We all know the<br/>difference between the pronouns he or she and thou, the plainest<br/>spoken amongst us; we all feel the influence of a something beyond<br/>common civility in our personal intercourse with each other— a<br/>something more early implanted. We cannot give any body the<br/>disagreeable hints that we may have been very full of the hour<br/>before. We feel things differently. And besides the operation of<br/>this, as a general principle, you may be sure that Miss Fairfax<br/>awes Mrs. Elton by her superiority both of mind and manner; and<br/>that, face to face, Mrs. Elton treats her with all the respect<br/>which she has a claim to. Such a woman as Jane Fairfax probably<br/>never fell in Mrs. Elton's way before—and no degree of vanity can<br/>prevent her acknowledging her own comparative littleness in action,<br/>if not in consciousness."<br/><br/>"I know how highly you think of Jane Fairfax," said Emma. Little<br/>Henry was in her thoughts, and a mixture of alarm and delicacy made<br/>her irresolute what else to say.<br/><br/>
