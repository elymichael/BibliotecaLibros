<br/>"I certainly must," said she. "This sensation of listlessness,<br/>weariness, stupidity, this disinclination to sit down and employ<br/>myself, this feeling of every thing's being dull and insipid about<br/>the house!— I must be in love; I should be the oddest creature in<br/>the world if I were not—for a few weeks at least. Well! evil to<br/>some is always good to others. I shall have many fellow-mourners<br/>for the ball, if not for Frank Churchill; but Mr. Knightley will be<br/>happy. He may spend the evening with his dear William Larkins now<br/>if he likes."<br/><br/>Mr. Knightley, however, shewed no triumphant happiness. He could<br/>not say that he was sorry on his own account; his very cheerful<br/>look would have contradicted him if he had; but he said, and very<br/>steadily, that he was sorry for the disappointment of the others,<br/>and with considerable kindness added,<br/><br/>"You, Emma, who have so few opportunities of dancing, you are<br/>really out of luck; you are very much out of luck!"<br/><br/>It was some days before she saw Jane Fairfax, to judge of her<br/>honest regret in this woeful change; but when they did meet, her<br/>composure was odious. She had been particularly unwell, however,<br/>suffering from headache to a degree, which made her aunt declare,<br/>that had the ball taken place, she did not think Jane could have<br/>attended it; and it was charity to impute some of her unbecoming<br/>indifference to the languor of ill-health.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
