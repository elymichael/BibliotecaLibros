"I am going to Kingston. Can I do any thing for you?"

"Oh! dear, Kingston—are you?—Mrs. Cole was saying the other day
she wanted something from Kingston."

"Mrs. Cole has servants to send. Can I do any thing for
you?"

"No, I thank you. But do come in. Who do you think is here?—
Miss Woodhouse and Miss Smith; so kind as to call to hear the new
pianoforte. Do put up your horse at the Crown, and come in."

"Well," said he, in a deliberating manner, "for five minutes,
perhaps."

"And here is Mrs. Weston and Mr. Frank Churchill too!—Quite
delightful; so many friends!"

"No, not now, I thank you. I could not stay two minutes. I must
get on to Kingston as fast as I can."

"Oh! do come in. They will be so very happy to see you."

"No, no; your room is full enough. I will call another day, and
hear the pianoforte."

"Well, I am so sorry!—Oh! Mr. Knightley, what a delightful party
last night; how extremely pleasant.—Did you ever see such dancing?—
Was not it delightful?—Miss Woodhouse and Mr. Frank Churchill; I
never saw any thing equal to it."
