It was by no means his daughter's wish that the intellects of<br/>Highbury in general should be put under requisition. Mr. Elton was<br/>the only one whose assistance she asked. He was invited to<br/>contribute any really good enigmas, charades, or conundrums that he<br/>might recollect; and she had the pleasure of seeing him most<br/>intently at work with his recollections; and at the same time, as<br/>she could perceive, most earnestly careful that nothing ungallant,<br/>nothing that did not breathe a compliment to the sex should pass<br/>his lips.
