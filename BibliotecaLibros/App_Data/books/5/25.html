<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>6<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>Emma could not feel a doubt of having given Harriet's fancy a<br/>proper direction and raised the gratitude of her young vanity to a<br/>very good purpose, for she found her decidedly more sensible than<br/>before of Mr. Elton's being a remarkably handsome man, with most<br/>agreeable manners; and as she had no hesitation in following up the<br/>assurance of his admiration by agreeable hints, she was soon pretty<br/>confident of creating as much liking on Harriet's side, as there<br/>could be any occasion for. She was quite convinced of Mr. Elton's<br/>being in the fairest way of falling in love, if not in love<br/>already. She had no scruple with regard to him. He talked of<br/>Harriet, and praised her so warmly, that she could not suppose any<br/>thing wanting which a little time would not add. His perception of<br/>the striking improvement of Harriet's manner, since her<br/>introduction at Hartfield, was not one of the least agreeable<br/>proofs of his growing attachment.<br/><br/>"You have given Miss Smith all that she required," said he; "you<br/>have made her graceful and easy. She was a beautiful creature when<br/>she came to you, but, in my opinion, the attractions you have added<br/>are infinitely superior to what she received from nature."<br/><br/>"I am glad you think I have been useful to her; but Harriet only<br/>wanted drawing out, and receiving a few, very few hints. She had<br/>all the natural grace of sweetness of temper and artlessness in<br/>herself. I have done very little."<br/><br/>"If it were admissible to contradict a lady," said the gallant<br/>Mr. Eltonâ€”<br/><br/>"I have perhaps given her a little more decision of character,<br/>have taught her to think on points which had not fallen in her way<br/>before."<br/><br/>"Exactly so; that is what principally strikes me. So much<br/>superadded decision of character! Skilful has been the hand!"<br/><br/>
