But she had made up her mind how to meet this presumption so<br/>many weeks before it appeared, that when the insult came at last,<br/>it found her very differently affected. Donwell and Randalls had<br/>received their invitation, and none had come for her father and<br/>herself; and Mrs. Weston's accounting for it with "I suppose they<br/>will not take the liberty with you; they know you do not dine out,"<br/>was not quite sufficient. She felt that she should like to have had<br/>the power of refusal; and afterwards, as the idea of the party to<br/>be assembled there, consisting precisely of those whose society was<br/>dearest to her, occurred again and again, she did not know that she<br/>might not have been tempted to accept. Harriet was to be there in<br/>the evening, and the Bateses. They had been speaking of it as they<br/>walked about Highbury the day before, and Frank Churchill had most<br/>earnestly lamented her absence. Might not the evening end in a<br/>dance? had been a question of his. The bare possibility of it acted<br/>as a farther irritation on her spirits; and her being left in<br/>solitary grandeur, even supposing the omission to be intended as a<br/>compliment, was but poor comfort.<br/><br/>It was the arrival of this very invitation while the Westons<br/>were at Hartfield, which made their presence so acceptable; for<br/>though her first remark, on reading it, was that "of course it must<br/>be declined," she so very soon proceeded to ask them what they<br/>advised her to do, that their advice for her going was most prompt<br/>and successful.<br/><br/>She owned that, considering every thing, she was not absolutely<br/>without inclination for the party. The Coles expressed themselves<br/>so properly—there was so much real attention in the manner of it—<br/>so much consideration for her father. "They would have solicited<br/>the honour earlier, but had been waiting the arrival of a<br/>folding-screen from London, which they hoped might keep Mr.<br/>Woodhouse from any draught of air, and therefore induce him the<br/>more readily to give them the honour of his company." Upon the<br/>whole, she was very persuadable; and it being briefly settled among<br/>themselves how it might be done without neglecting his comfort—how<br/>certainly Mrs. Goddard, if not Mrs. Bates, might be depended on for<br/>bearing him company— Mr. Woodhouse was to be talked into an<br/>acquiescence of his daughter's going out to dinner on a day now<br/>near at hand, and spending the whole evening away from him. As for<br/>his going, Emma did not wish him to think it possible, the hours<br/>would be too late, and the party too numerous. He was soon pretty<br/>well resigned.<br/><br/>"I am not fond of dinner-visiting," said he—"I never was. No<br/>more is Emma. Late hours do not agree with us. I am sorry Mr. and<br/>Mrs. Cole should have done it. I think it would be much better if<br/>they would come in one afternoon next summer, and take their tea<br/>with us—take us in their afternoon walk; which they might do, as<br/>our hours are so reasonable, and yet get home without being out in<br/>the damp of the evening. The dews of a summer evening are what I<br/>would not expose any body to. However, as they are so very desirous<br/>to have dear Emma dine with them, and as you will both be there,<br/>and Mr. Knightley too, to take care of her, I cannot wish to<br/>prevent it, provided the weather be what it ought, neither damp,<br/>nor cold, nor windy." Then turning to Mrs. Weston, with a look of<br/>gentle reproach—"Ah! Miss Taylor, if you had not married, you would<br/>have staid at home with me."<br/><br/>"Well, sir," cried Mr. Weston, "as I took Miss Taylor away, it<br/>is incumbent on me to supply her place, if I can; and I will step<br/>to Mrs. Goddard in a moment, if you wish it."<br/><br/>But the idea of any thing to be done in a moment, was<br/>increasing, not lessening, Mr. Woodhouse's agitation. The ladies<br/>knew better how to allay it. Mr. Weston must be quiet, and every<br/>thing deliberately arranged.<br/><br/>With this treatment, Mr. Woodhouse was soon composed enough for<br/>talking as usual. "He should be happy to see Mrs. Goddard. He had a<br/>great regard for Mrs. Goddard; and Emma should write a line, and<br/>invite her. James could take the note. But first of all, there must<br/>be an answer written to Mrs. Cole."<br/><br/>"You will make my excuses, my dear, as civilly as possible. You<br/>will say that I am quite an invalid, and go no where, and therefore<br/>must decline their obliging invitation; beginning with my<br/>compliments, of course. But you will do every thing right. I need<br/>not tell you what is to be done. We must remember to let James know<br/>that the carriage will be wanted on Tuesday. I shall have no fears<br/>for you with him. We have never been there above once since the new<br/>approach was made; but still I have no doubt that James will take<br/>you very safely. And when you get there, you must tell him at what<br/>time you would have him come for you again; and you had better name<br/>an early hour. You will not like staying late. You will get very<br/>tired when tea is over."<br/><br/>"But you would not wish me to come away before I am tired,<br/>papa?"<br/><br/>"Oh! no, my love; but you will soon be tired. There will be a<br/>great many people talking at once. You will not like the<br/>noise."<br/><br/>"But, my dear sir," cried Mr. Weston, "if Emma comes away early,<br/>it will be breaking up the party."<br/>
