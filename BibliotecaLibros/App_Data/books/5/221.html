<br/>It was a sweet view—sweet to the eye and the mind. English<br/>verdure, English culture, English comfort, seen under a sun bright,<br/>without being oppressive.<br/><br/>In this walk Emma and Mr. Weston found all the others assembled;<br/>and towards this view she immediately perceived Mr. Knightley and<br/>Harriet distinct from the rest, quietly leading the way. Mr.<br/>Knightley and Harriet!—It was an odd tete-a-tete; but she was glad<br/>to see it.—There had been a time when he would have scorned her as<br/>a companion, and turned from her with little ceremony. Now they<br/>seemed in pleasant conversation. There had been a time also when<br/>Emma would have been sorry to see Harriet in a spot so favourable<br/>for the Abbey Mill Farm; but now she feared it not. It might be<br/>safely viewed with all its appendages of prosperity and beauty, its<br/>rich pastures, spreading flocks, orchard in blossom, and light<br/>column of smoke ascending.—She joined them at the wall, and found<br/>them more engaged in talking than in looking around. He was giving<br/>Harriet information as to modes of agriculture, etc. and Emma<br/>received a smile which seemed to say, "These are my own concerns. I<br/>have a right to talk on such subjects, without being suspected of<br/>introducing Robert Martin."—She did not suspect him. It was too old<br/>a story.—Robert Martin had probably ceased to think of<br/>Harriet.—They took a few turns together along the walk.—The shade<br/>was most refreshing, and Emma found it the pleasantest part of the<br/>day.<br/><br/>The next remove was to the house; they must all go in and eat;—<br/>and they were all seated and busy, and still Frank Churchill did<br/>not come. Mrs. Weston looked, and looked in vain. His father would<br/>not own himself uneasy, and laughed at her fears; but she could not<br/>be cured of wishing that he would part with his black mare. He had<br/>expressed himself as to coming, with more than common certainty.<br/>"His aunt was so much better, that he had not a doubt of getting<br/>over to them."—Mrs. Churchill's state, however, as many were ready<br/>to remind her, was liable to such sudden variation as might<br/>disappoint her nephew in the most reasonable dependence—and Mrs.<br/>Weston was at last persuaded to believe, or to say, that it must be<br/>by some attack of Mrs. Churchill that he was prevented coming.—<br/>Emma looked at Harriet while the point was under consideration; she<br/>behaved very well, and betrayed no emotion.<br/><br/>The cold repast was over, and the party were to go out once more<br/>to see what had not yet been seen, the old Abbey fish-ponds;<br/>perhaps get as far as the clover, which was to be begun cutting on<br/>the morrow, or, at any rate, have the pleasure of being hot, and<br/>growing cool again.—Mr. Woodhouse, who had already taken his little<br/>round in the highest part of the gardens, where no damps from the<br/>river were imagined even by him, stirred no more; and his daughter<br/>resolved to remain with him, that Mrs. Weston might be persuaded<br/>away by her husband to the exercise and variety which her spirits<br/>seemed to need.<br/><br/>Mr. Knightley had done all in his power for Mr. Woodhouse's<br/>entertainment. Books of engravings, drawers of medals, cameos,<br/>corals, shells, and every other family collection within his<br/>cabinets, had been prepared for his old friend, to while away the<br/>morning; and the kindness had perfectly answered. Mr. Woodhouse had<br/>been exceedingly well amused. Mrs. Weston had been shewing them all<br/>to him, and now he would shew them all to Emma;—fortunate in having<br/>no other resemblance to a child, than in a total want of taste for<br/>what he saw, for he was slow, constant, and methodical.—Before this<br/>second looking over was begun, however, Emma walked into the hall<br/>for the sake of a few moments' free observation of the entrance and<br/>ground-plot of the house—and was hardly there, when Jane Fairfax<br/>appeared, coming quickly in from the garden, and with a look of<br/>escape.— Little expecting to meet Miss Woodhouse so soon, there was<br/>a start at first; but Miss Woodhouse was the very person she was in<br/>quest of.<br/><br/>"Will you be so kind," said she, "when I am missed, as to say<br/>that I am gone home?—I am going this moment.—My aunt is not aware<br/>how late it is, nor how long we have been absent—but I am sure we<br/>shall be wanted, and I am determined to go directly.—I have said<br/>nothing about it to any body. It would only be giving trouble and<br/>distress. Some are gone to the ponds, and some to the lime walk.<br/>Till they all come in I shall not be missed; and when they do, will<br/>you have the goodness to say that I am gone?"<br/><br/>"Certainly, if you wish it;—but you are not going to walk to<br/>Highbury alone?"<br/><br/>"Yes—what should hurt me?—I walk fast. I shall be at home in<br/>twenty minutes."<br/><br/>"But it is too far, indeed it is, to be walking quite alone. Let<br/>my father's servant go with you.—Let me order the carriage. It can<br/>be round in five minutes."<br/><br/>"Thank you, thank you—but on no account.—I would rather walk.—<br/>And for me to be afraid of walking alone!—I, who may so soon have<br/>to guard others!"<br/><br/>
