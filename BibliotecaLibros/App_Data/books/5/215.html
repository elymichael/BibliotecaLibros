He remained at Hartfield after all the rest, his thoughts full<br/>of what he had seen; so full, that when the candles came to assist<br/>his observations, he must—yes, he certainly must, as a friend— an<br/>anxious friend—give Emma some hint, ask her some question. He could<br/>not see her in a situation of such danger, without trying to<br/>preserve her. It was his duty.<br/><br/>"Pray, Emma," said he, "may I ask in what lay the great<br/>amusement, the poignant sting of the last word given to you and<br/>Miss Fairfax? I saw the word, and am curious to know how it could<br/>be so very entertaining to the one, and so very distressing to the<br/>other."<br/><br/>Emma was extremely confused. She could not endure to give him<br/>the true explanation; for though her suspicions were by no means<br/>removed, she was really ashamed of having ever imparted them.<br/><br/>"Oh!" she cried in evident embarrassment, "it all meant nothing;<br/>a mere joke among ourselves."<br/><br/>"The joke," he replied gravely, "seemed confined to you and Mr.<br/>Churchill."<br/><br/>He had hoped she would speak again, but she did not. She would<br/>rather busy herself about any thing than speak. He sat a little<br/>while in doubt. A variety of evils crossed his mind. Interference—<br/>fruitless interference. Emma's confusion, and the acknowledged<br/>intimacy, seemed to declare her affection engaged. Yet he would<br/>speak. He owed it to her, to risk any thing that might be involved<br/>in an unwelcome interference, rather than her welfare; to encounter<br/>any thing, rather than the remembrance of neglect in such a<br/>cause.<br/><br/>"My dear Emma," said he at last, with earnest kindness, "do you<br/>think you perfectly understand the degree of acquaintance between<br/>the gentleman and lady we have been speaking of?"<br/><br/>"Between Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Fairfax? Oh! yes,<br/>perfectly.— Why do you make a doubt of it?"<br/><br/>"Have you never at any time had reason to think that he admired<br/>her, or that she admired him?"<br/><br/>"Never, never!" she cried with a most open eagerness—"Never, for<br/>the twentieth part of a moment, did such an idea occur to me. And<br/>how could it possibly come into your head?"<br/><br/>"I have lately imagined that I saw symptoms of attachment<br/>between them— certain expressive looks, which I did not believe<br/>meant to be public."<br/>
