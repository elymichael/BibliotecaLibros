She had not time to know how Mr. Elton took the reproof, so<br/>rapidly did another subject succeed; for Mr. John Knightley now<br/>came into the room from examining the weather, and opened on them<br/>all with the information of the ground being covered with snow, and<br/>of its still snowing fast, with a strong drifting wind; concluding<br/>with these words to Mr. Woodhouse:<br/><br/>"This will prove a spirited beginning of your winter<br/>engagements, sir. Something new for your coachman and horses to be<br/>making their way through a storm of snow."<br/><br/>Poor Mr. Woodhouse was silent from consternation; but every body<br/>else had something to say; every body was either surprized or not<br/>surprized, and had some question to ask, or some comfort to offer.<br/>Mrs. Weston and Emma tried earnestly to cheer him and turn his<br/>attention from his son-in-law, who was pursuing his triumph rather<br/>unfeelingly.<br/><br/>"I admired your resolution very much, sir," said he, "in<br/>venturing out in such weather, for of course you saw there would be<br/>snow very soon. Every body must have seen the snow coming on. I<br/>admired your spirit; and I dare say we shall get home very well.<br/>Another hour or two's snow can hardly make the road impassable; and<br/>we are two carriages; if one is blown over in the bleak part of the<br/>common field there will be the other at hand. I dare say we shall<br/>be all safe at Hartfield before midnight."<br/><br/>Mr. Weston, with triumph of a different sort, was confessing<br/>that he had known it to be snowing some time, but had not said a<br/>word, lest it should make Mr. Woodhouse uncomfortable, and be an<br/>excuse for his hurrying away. As to there being any quantity of<br/>snow fallen or likely to fall to impede their return, that was a<br/>mere joke; he was afraid they would find no difficulty. He wished<br/>the road might be impassable, that he might be able to keep them<br/>all at Randalls; and with the utmost good-will was sure that<br/>accommodation might be found for every body, calling on his wife to<br/>agree with him, that with a little contrivance, every body might be<br/>lodged, which she hardly knew how to do, from the consciousness of<br/>there being but two spare rooms in the house.<br/><br/>"What is to be done, my dear Emma?—what is to be done?" was Mr.<br/>Woodhouse's first exclamation, and all that he could say for some<br/>time. To her he looked for comfort; and her assurances of safety,<br/>her representation of the excellence of the horses, and of James,<br/>and of their having so many friends about them, revived him a<br/>little.<br/><br/>His eldest daughter's alarm was equal to his own. The horror of<br/>being blocked up at Randalls, while her children were at Hartfield,<br/>was full in her imagination; and fancying the road to be now just<br/>passable for adventurous people, but in a state that admitted no<br/>delay, she was eager to have it settled, that her father and Emma<br/>should remain at Randalls, while she and her husband set forward<br/>instantly through all the possible accumulations of drifted snow<br/>that might impede them.<br/><br/>"You had better order the carriage directly, my love," said she;<br/>"I dare say we shall be able to get along, if we set off directly;<br/>and if we do come to any thing very bad, I can get out and walk. I<br/>am not at all afraid. I should not mind walking half the way. I<br/>could change my shoes, you know, the moment I got home; and it is<br/>not the sort of thing that gives me cold."<br/><br/>"Indeed!" replied he. "Then, my dear Isabella, it is the most<br/>extraordinary sort of thing in the world, for in general every<br/>thing does give you cold. Walk home!—you are prettily shod for<br/>walking home, I dare say. It will be bad enough for the<br/>horses."<br/><br/>Isabella turned to Mrs. Weston for her approbation of the plan.<br/>Mrs. Weston could only approve. Isabella then went to Emma; but<br/>Emma could not so entirely give up the hope of their being all able<br/>to get away; and they were still discussing the point, when Mr.<br/>Knightley, who had left the room immediately after his brother's<br/>first report of the snow, came back again, and told them that he<br/>had been out of doors to examine, and could answer for there not<br/>being the smallest difficulty in their getting home, whenever they<br/>liked it, either now or an hour hence. He had gone beyond the<br/>sweep— some way along the Highbury road—the snow was nowhere above<br/>half an inch deep—in many places hardly enough to whiten the<br/>ground; a very few flakes were falling at present, but the clouds<br/>were parting, and there was every appearance of its being soon<br/>over. He had seen the coachmen, and they both agreed with him in<br/>there being nothing to apprehend.<br/><br/>To Isabella, the relief of such tidings was very great, and they<br/>were scarcely less acceptable to Emma on her father's account, who<br/>was immediately set as much at ease on the subject as his nervous<br/>constitution allowed; but the alarm that had been raised could not<br/>be appeased so as to admit of any comfort for him while he<br/>continued at Randalls. He was satisfied of there being no present<br/>danger in returning home, but no assurances could convince him that<br/>it was safe to stay; and while the others were variously urging and<br/>recommending, Mr. Knightley and Emma settled it in a few brief<br/>sentences: thus—<br/>
