<br/>"Very true, Miss Woodhouse, so she will. He is the very best<br/>young man—But, my dear Jane, if you remember, I told you yesterday<br/>he was precisely the height of Mr. Perry. Miss Hawkins,—I dare say,<br/>an excellent young woman. His extreme attention to my mother—<br/>wanting her to sit in the vicarage pew, that she might hear the<br/>better, for my mother is a little deaf, you know—it is not much,<br/>but she does not hear quite quick. Jane says that Colonel Campbell<br/>is a little deaf. He fancied bathing might be good for it—the warm<br/>bath— but she says it did him no lasting benefit. Colonel Campbell,<br/>you know, is quite our angel. And Mr. Dixon seems a very charming<br/>young man, quite worthy of him. It is such a happiness when good<br/>people get together—and they always do. Now, here will be Mr. Elton<br/>and Miss Hawkins; and there are the Coles, such very good people;<br/>and the Perrys—I suppose there never was a happier or a better<br/>couple than Mr. and Mrs. Perry. I say, sir," turning to Mr.<br/>Woodhouse, "I think there are few places with such society as<br/>Highbury. I always say, we are quite blessed in our neighbours.—My<br/>dear sir, if there is one thing my mother loves better than<br/>another, it is pork— a roast loin of pork—"<br/><br/>"As to who, or what Miss Hawkins is, or how long he has been<br/>acquainted with her," said Emma, "nothing I suppose can be known.<br/>One feels that it cannot be a very long acquaintance. He has been<br/>gone only four weeks."<br/><br/>Nobody had any information to give; and, after a few more<br/>wonderings, Emma said,<br/><br/>"You are silent, Miss Fairfax—but I hope you mean to take an<br/>interest in this news. You, who have been hearing and seeing so<br/>much of late on these subjects, who must have been so deep in the<br/>business on Miss Campbell's account—we shall not excuse your being<br/>indifferent about Mr. Elton and Miss Hawkins."<br/><br/>"When I have seen Mr. Elton," replied Jane, "I dare say I shall<br/>be interested—but I believe it requires that with me. And as it is<br/>some months since Miss Campbell married, the impression may be a<br/>little worn off."<br/><br/>"Yes, he has been gone just four weeks, as you observe, Miss<br/>Woodhouse," said Miss Bates, "four weeks yesterday.—A Miss<br/>Hawkins!—Well, I had always rather fancied it would be some young<br/>lady hereabouts; not that I ever—Mrs. Cole once whispered to me—but<br/>I immediately said, `No, Mr. Elton is a most worthy young<br/>man—but'—In short, I do not think I am particularly quick at those<br/>sort of discoveries. I do not pretend to it. What is before me, I<br/>see. At the same time, nobody could wonder if Mr. Elton should have<br/>aspired—Miss Woodhouse lets me chatter on, so good-humouredly. She<br/>knows I would not offend for the world. How does Miss Smith do? She<br/>seems quite recovered now. Have you heard from Mrs. John Knightley<br/>lately? Oh! those dear little children. Jane, do you know I always<br/>fancy Mr. Dixon like Mr. John Knightley. I mean in person—tall, and<br/>with that sort of look—and not very talkative."<br/><br/>"Quite wrong, my dear aunt; there is no likeness at all."<br/><br/>"Very odd! but one never does form a just idea of any body<br/>beforehand. One takes up a notion, and runs away with it. Mr.<br/>Dixon, you say, is not, strictly speaking, handsome?"<br/><br/>"Handsome! Oh! no—far from it—certainly plain. I told you he was<br/>plain."<br/><br/>"My dear, you said that Miss Campbell would not allow him to be<br/>plain, and that you yourself—"<br/><br/>
