Behold him there, the monarch of the seas!<br/><br/>That is ship;—plain as it can be.—Now for the cream.<br/><br/>But ah! united, (courtship, you know,) what reverse we have!<br/><br/>Man's boasted power and freedom, all are flown.<br/><br/>Lord of the earth and sea, he bends a slave,<br/><br/>And woman, lovely woman, reigns alone.<br/><br/>A very proper compliment!—and then follows the application,<br/>which I think, my dear Harriet, you cannot find much difficulty in<br/>comprehending. Read it in comfort to yourself. There can be no<br/>doubt of its being written for you and to you."<br/><br/>Harriet could not long resist so delightful a persuasion. She<br/>read the concluding lines, and was all flutter and happiness. She<br/>could not speak. But she was not wanted to speak. It was enough for<br/>her to feel. Emma spoke for her.<br/><br/>"There is so pointed, and so particular a meaning in this<br/>compliment," said she, "that I cannot have a doubt as to Mr.<br/>Elton's intentions. You are his object—and you will soon receive<br/>the completest proof of it. I thought it must be so. I thought I<br/>could not be so deceived; but now, it is clear; the state of his<br/>mind is as clear and decided, as my wishes on the subject have been<br/>ever since I knew you. Yes, Harriet, just so long have I been<br/>wanting the very circumstance to happen what has happened. I could<br/>never tell whether an attachment between you and Mr. Elton were<br/>most desirable or most natural. Its probability and its eligibility<br/>have really so equalled each other! I am very happy. I congratulate<br/>you, my dear Harriet, with all my heart. This is an attachment<br/>which a woman may well feel pride in creating. This is a connexion<br/>which offers nothing but good. It will give you every thing that<br/>you want—consideration, independence, a proper home—it will fix you<br/>in the centre of all your real friends, close to Hartfield and to<br/>me, and confirm our intimacy for ever. This, Harriet, is an<br/>alliance which can never raise a blush in either of us."<br/><br/>"Dear Miss Woodhouse!"—and "Dear Miss Woodhouse," was all that<br/>Harriet, with many tender embraces could articulate at first; but<br/>when they did arrive at something more like conversation, it was<br/>sufficiently clear to her friend that she saw, felt, anticipated,<br/>and remembered just as she ought. Mr. Elton's superiority had very<br/>ample acknowledgment.<br/><br/>"Whatever you say is always right," cried Harriet, "and<br/>therefore I suppose, and believe, and hope it must be so; but<br/>otherwise I could not have imagined it. It is so much beyond any<br/>thing I deserve. Mr. Elton, who might marry any body! There cannot<br/>be two opinions about him. He is so very superior. Only think of<br/>those sweet verses—`To Miss ————.' Dear me, how clever!—Could it<br/>really be meant for me?"<br/>
