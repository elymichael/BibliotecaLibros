<br/>Emma found that she must wait; and now it required little<br/>effort. She asked no more questions therefore, merely employed her<br/>own fancy, and that soon pointed out to her the probability of its<br/>being some money concern—something just come to light, of a<br/>disagreeable nature in the circumstances of the family,—something<br/>which the late event at Richmond had brought forward. Her fancy was<br/>very active. Half a dozen natural children, perhaps—and poor Frank<br/>cut off!— This, though very undesirable, would be no matter of<br/>agony to her. It inspired little more than an animating<br/>curiosity.<br/><br/>"Who is that gentleman on horseback?" said she, as they<br/>proceeded— speaking more to assist Mr. Weston in keeping his<br/>secret, than with any other view.<br/><br/>"I do not know.—One of the Otways.—Not Frank;—it is not Frank, I<br/>assure you. You will not see him. He is half way to Windsor by this<br/>time."<br/><br/>"Has your son been with you, then?"<br/><br/>"Oh! yes—did not you know?—Well, well, never mind."<br/><br/>For a moment he was silent; and then added, in a tone much more<br/>guarded and demure,<br/><br/>"Yes, Frank came over this morning, just to ask us how we<br/>did."<br/><br/>They hurried on, and were speedily at Randalls.—"Well, my dear,"<br/>said he, as they entered the room—"I have brought her, and now I<br/>hope you will soon be better. I shall leave you together. There is<br/>no use in delay. I shall not be far off, if you want me."— And Emma<br/>distinctly heard him add, in a lower tone, before he quitted the<br/>room,—"I have been as good as my word. She has not the least<br/>idea."<br/><br/>Mrs. Weston was looking so ill, and had an air of so much<br/>perturbation, that Emma's uneasiness increased; and the moment they<br/>were alone, she eagerly said,<br/><br/>"What is it my dear friend? Something of a very unpleasant<br/>nature, I find, has occurred;—do let me know directly what it is. I<br/>have been walking all this way in complete suspense. We both abhor<br/>suspense. Do not let mine continue longer. It will do you good to<br/>speak of your distress, whatever it may be."<br/><br/>
