<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>11<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>It may be possible to do without dancing entirely. Instances<br/>have been known of young people passing many, many months<br/>successively, without being at any ball of any description, and no<br/>material injury accrue either to body or mind;—but when a beginning<br/>is made— when the felicities of rapid motion have once been, though<br/>slightly, felt—it must be a very heavy set that does not ask for<br/>more.<br/><br/>Frank Churchill had danced once at Highbury, and longed to dance<br/>again; and the last half-hour of an evening which Mr. Woodhouse was<br/>persuaded to spend with his daughter at Randalls, was passed by the<br/>two young people in schemes on the subject. Frank's was the first<br/>idea; and his the greatest zeal in pursuing it; for the lady was<br/>the best judge of the difficulties, and the most solicitous for<br/>accommodation and appearance. But still she had inclination enough<br/>for shewing people again how delightfully Mr. Frank Churchill and<br/>Miss Woodhouse danced—for doing that in which she need not blush to<br/>compare herself with Jane Fairfax—and even for simple dancing<br/>itself, without any of the wicked aids of vanity—to assist him<br/>first in pacing out the room they were in to see what it could be<br/>made to hold—and then in taking the dimensions of the other<br/>parlour, in the hope of discovering, in spite of all that Mr.<br/>Weston could say of their exactly equal size, that it was a little<br/>the largest.<br/><br/>His first proposition and request, that the dance begun at Mr.<br/>Cole's should be finished there—that the same party should be<br/>collected, and the same musician engaged, met with the readiest<br/>acquiescence. Mr. Weston entered into the idea with thorough<br/>enjoyment, and Mrs. Weston most willingly undertook to play as long<br/>as they could wish to dance; and the interesting employment had<br/>followed, of reckoning up exactly who there would be, and<br/>portioning out the indispensable division of space to every<br/>couple.<br/><br/>"You and Miss Smith, and Miss Fairfax, will be three, and the<br/>two Miss Coxes five," had been repeated many times over. "And there<br/>will be the two Gilberts, young Cox, my father, and myself, besides<br/>Mr. Knightley. Yes, that will be quite enough for pleasure. You and<br/>Miss Smith, and Miss Fairfax, will be three, and the two Miss Coxes<br/>five; and for five couple there will be plenty of room."<br/><br/>But soon it came to be on one side,<br/><br/>"But will there be good room for five couple?—I really do not<br/>think there will."<br/><br/>
