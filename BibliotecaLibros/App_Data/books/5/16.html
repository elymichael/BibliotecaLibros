<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>4<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>Harriet Smith's intimacy at Hartfield was soon a settled thing.<br/>Quick and decided in her ways, Emma lost no time in inviting,<br/>encouraging, and telling her to come very often; and as their<br/>acquaintance increased, so did their satisfaction in each other. As<br/>a walking companion, Emma had very early foreseen how useful she<br/>might find her. In that respect Mrs. Weston's loss had been<br/>important. Her father never went beyond the shrubbery, where two<br/>divisions of the ground sufficed him for his long walk, or his<br/>short, as the year varied; and since Mrs. Weston's marriage her<br/>exercise had been too much confined. She had ventured once alone to<br/>Randalls, but it was not pleasant; and a Harriet Smith, therefore,<br/>one whom she could summon at any time to a walk, would be a<br/>valuable addition to her privileges. But in every respect, as she<br/>saw more of her, she approved her, and was confirmed in all her<br/>kind designs.<br/><br/>Harriet certainly was not clever, but she had a sweet, docile,<br/>grateful disposition, was totally free from conceit, and only<br/>desiring to be guided by any one she looked up to. Her early<br/>attachment to herself was very amiable; and her inclination for<br/>good company, and power of appreciating what was elegant and<br/>clever, shewed that there was no want of taste, though strength of<br/>understanding must not be expected. Altogether she was quite<br/>convinced of Harriet Smith's being exactly the young friend she<br/>wanted—exactly the something which her home required. Such a friend<br/>as Mrs. Weston was out of the question. Two such could never be<br/>granted. Two such she did not want. It was quite a different sort<br/>of thing, a sentiment distinct and independent. Mrs. Weston was the<br/>object of a regard which had its basis in gratitude and esteem.<br/>Harriet would be loved as one to whom she could be useful. For Mrs.<br/>Weston there was nothing to be done; for Harriet every thing.<br/><br/>Her first attempts at usefulness were in an endeavour to find<br/>out who were the parents, but Harriet could not tell. She was ready<br/>to tell every thing in her power, but on this subject questions<br/>were vain. Emma was obliged to fancy what she liked—but she could<br/>never believe that in the same situation she should not have<br/>discovered the truth. Harriet had no penetration. She had been<br/>satisfied to hear and believe just what Mrs. Goddard chose to tell<br/>her; and looked no farther.<br/><br/>Mrs. Goddard, and the teachers, and the girls and the affairs of<br/>the school in general, formed naturally a great part of the<br/>conversation—and but for her acquaintance with the Martins of<br/>Abbey-Mill Farm, it must have been the whole. But the Martins<br/>occupied her thoughts a good deal; she had spent two very happy<br/>months with them, and now loved to talk of the pleasures of her<br/>visit, and describe the many comforts and wonders of the place.<br/>Emma encouraged her talkativeness—amused by such a picture of<br/>another set of beings, and enjoying the youthful simplicity which<br/>could speak with so much exultation of Mrs. Martin's having "two<br/>parlours, two very good parlours, indeed; one of them quite as<br/>large as Mrs. Goddard's drawing-room; and of her having an upper<br/>maid who had lived five-and-twenty years with her; and of their<br/>having eight cows, two of them Alderneys, and one a little Welch<br/>cow, a very pretty little Welch cow indeed; and of Mrs. Martin's<br/>saying as she was so fond of it, it should be called her cow; and<br/>of their having a very handsome summer-house in their garden, where<br/>some day next year they were all to drink tea:—a very handsome<br/>summer-house, large enough to hold a dozen people."<br/><br/>For some time she was amused, without thinking beyond the<br/>immediate cause; but as she came to understand the family better,<br/>other feelings arose. She had taken up a wrong idea, fancying it<br/>was a mother and daughter, a son and son's wife, who all lived<br/>together; but when it appeared that the Mr. Martin, who bore a part<br/>in the narrative, and was always mentioned with approbation for his<br/>great good-nature in doing something or other, was a single man;<br/>that there was no young Mrs. Martin, no wife in the case; she did<br/>suspect danger to her poor little friend from all this hospitality<br/>and kindness, and that, if she were not taken care of, she might be<br/>required to sink herself forever.<br/><br/>With this inspiriting notion, her questions increased in number<br/>and meaning; and she particularly led Harriet to talk more of Mr.<br/>Martin, and there was evidently no dislike to it. Harriet was very<br/>ready to speak of the share he had had in their moonlight walks and<br/>merry evening games; and dwelt a good deal upon his being so very<br/>good-humoured and obliging. He had gone three miles round one day<br/>in order to bring her some walnuts, because she had said how fond<br/>she was of them, and in every thing else he was so very obliging.<br/>He had his shepherd's son into the parlour one night on purpose to<br/>sing to her. She was very fond of singing. He could sing a little<br/>himself. She believed he was very clever, and understood every<br/>thing. He had a very fine flock, and, while she was with them, he<br/>had been bid more for his wool than any body in the country. She<br/>believed every body spoke well of him. His mother and sisters were<br/>very fond of him. Mrs. Martin had told her one day (and there was a<br/>blush as she said it,) that it was impossible for any body to be a<br/>better son, and therefore she was sure, whenever he married, he<br/>would make a good husband. Not that she wanted him to marry. She<br/>was in no hurry at all.<br/><br/>
