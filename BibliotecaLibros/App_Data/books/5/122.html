<br/>"And now that I understand your question, I must pronounce it to<br/>be a very unfair one. It is always the lady's right to decide on<br/>the degree of acquaintance. Miss Fairfax must already have given<br/>her account.— I shall not commit myself by claiming more than she<br/>may chuse to allow."<br/><br/>"Upon my word! you answer as discreetly as she could do herself.<br/>But her account of every thing leaves so much to be guessed, she is<br/>so very reserved, so very unwilling to give the least information<br/>about any body, that I really think you may say what you like of<br/>your acquaintance with her."<br/><br/>"May I, indeed?—Then I will speak the truth, and nothing suits<br/>me so well. I met her frequently at Weymouth. I had known the<br/>Campbells a little in town; and at Weymouth we were very much in<br/>the same set. Colonel Campbell is a very agreeable man, and Mrs.<br/>Campbell a friendly, warm-hearted woman. I like them all."<br/><br/>"You know Miss Fairfax's situation in life, I conclude; what she<br/>is destined to be?"<br/><br/>"Yes—(rather hesitatingly)—I believe I do."<br/><br/>"You get upon delicate subjects, Emma," said Mrs. Weston<br/>smiling; "remember that I am here.—Mr. Frank Churchill hardly knows<br/>what to say when you speak of Miss Fairfax's situation in life. I<br/>will move a little farther off."<br/><br/>"I certainly do forget to think of her," said Emma, "as having<br/>ever been any thing but my friend and my dearest friend."<br/><br/>He looked as if he fully understood and honoured such a<br/>sentiment.<br/><br/>When the gloves were bought, and they had quitted the shop<br/>again, "Did you ever hear the young lady we were speaking of,<br/>play?" said Frank Churchill.<br/><br/>"Ever hear her!" repeated Emma. "You forget how much she belongs<br/>to Highbury. I have heard her every year of our lives since we both<br/>began. She plays charmingly."<br/><br/>
