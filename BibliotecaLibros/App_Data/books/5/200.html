<br/>"So very obliging of you!—No rain at all. Nothing to signify. I<br/>do not care for myself. Quite thick shoes. And Jane declares—<br/>Well!—(as soon as she was within the door) Well! This is brilliant<br/>indeed!—This is admirable!—Excellently contrived, upon my word.<br/>Nothing wanting. Could not have imagined it.—So well lighted up!—<br/>Jane, Jane, look!—did you ever see any thing? Oh! Mr. Weston, you<br/>must really have had Aladdin's lamp. Good Mrs. Stokes would not<br/>know her own room again. I saw her as I came in; she was standing<br/>in the entrance. `Oh! Mrs. Stokes,' said I— but I had not time for<br/>more." She was now met by Mrs. Weston.— "Very well, I thank you,<br/>ma'am. I hope you are quite well. Very happy to hear it. So afraid<br/>you might have a headache!— seeing you pass by so often, and<br/>knowing how much trouble you must have. Delighted to hear it<br/>indeed. Ah! dear Mrs. Elton, so obliged to you for the<br/>carriage!—excellent time. Jane and I quite ready. Did not keep the<br/>horses a moment. Most comfortable carriage.— Oh! and I am sure our<br/>thanks are due to you, Mrs. Weston, on that score. Mrs. Elton had<br/>most kindly sent Jane a note, or we should have been.— But two such<br/>offers in one day!—Never were such neighbours. I said to my mother,<br/>`Upon my word, ma'am—.' Thank you, my mother is remarkably well.<br/>Gone to Mr. Woodhouse's. I made her take her shawl—for the evenings<br/>are not warm—her large new shawl— Mrs. Dixon's wedding-present.—So<br/>kind of her to think of my mother! Bought at Weymouth, you know—Mr.<br/>Dixon's choice. There were three others, Jane says, which they<br/>hesitated about some time. Colonel Campbell rather preferred an<br/>olive. My dear Jane, are you sure you did not wet your feet?—It was<br/>but a drop or two, but I am so afraid:—but Mr. Frank Churchill was<br/>so extremely— and there was a mat to step upon—I shall never forget<br/>his extreme politeness.—Oh! Mr. Frank Churchill, I must tell you my<br/>mother's spectacles have never been in fault since; the rivet never<br/>came out again. My mother often talks of your good-nature. Does not<br/>she, Jane?—Do not we often talk of Mr. Frank Churchill?— Ah! here's<br/>Miss Woodhouse.—Dear Miss Woodhouse, how do you do?— Very well I<br/>thank you, quite well. This is meeting quite in fairy-land!— Such a<br/>transformation!—Must not compliment, I know (eyeing Emma most<br/>complacently)—that would be rude—but upon my word, Miss Woodhouse,<br/>you do look—how do you like Jane's hair?—You are a judge.— She did<br/>it all herself. Quite wonderful how she does her hair!— No<br/>hairdresser from London I think could.—Ah! Dr. Hughes I declare—<br/>and Mrs. Hughes. Must go and speak to Dr. and Mrs. Hughes for a<br/>moment.—How do you do? How do you do?—Very well, I thank you. This<br/>is delightful, is not it?—Where's dear Mr. Richard?— Oh! there he<br/>is. Don't disturb him. Much better employed talking to the young<br/>ladies. How do you do, Mr. Richard?—I saw you the other day as you<br/>rode through the town—Mrs. Otway, I protest!— and good Mr. Otway,<br/>and Miss Otway and Miss Caroline.—Such a host of friends!—and Mr.<br/>George and Mr. Arthur!—How do you do? How do you all do?—Quite<br/>well, I am much obliged to you. Never better.— Don't I hear another<br/>carriage?—Who can this be?—very likely the worthy Coles.—Upon my<br/>word, this is charming to be standing about among such friends! And<br/>such a noble fire!—I am quite roasted. No coffee, I thank you, for<br/>me—never take coffee.—A little tea if you please, sir, by and<br/>bye,—no hurry—Oh! here it comes. Every thing so good!"<br/><br/>Frank Churchill returned to his station by Emma; and as soon as<br/>Miss Bates was quiet, she found herself necessarily overhearing the<br/>discourse of Mrs. Elton and Miss Fairfax, who were standing a<br/>little way behind her.—He was thoughtful. Whether he were<br/>overhearing too, she could not determine. After a good many<br/>compliments to Jane on her dress and look, compliments very quietly<br/>and properly taken, Mrs. Elton was evidently wanting to be<br/>complimented herself— and it was, "How do you like my gown?—How do<br/>you like my trimming?— How has Wright done my hair?"—with many<br/>other relative questions, all answered with patient politeness.<br/>Mrs. Elton then said, "Nobody can think less of dress in general<br/>than I do—but upon such an occasion as this, when every body's eyes<br/>are so much upon me, and in compliment to the Westons—who I have no<br/>doubt are giving this ball chiefly to do me honour—I would not wish<br/>to be inferior to others. And I see very few pearls in the room<br/>except mine.— So Frank Churchill is a capital dancer, I<br/>understand.—We shall see if our styles suit.—A fine young man<br/>certainly is Frank Churchill. I like him very well."<br/><br/>At this moment Frank began talking so vigorously, that Emma<br/>could not but imagine he had overheard his own praises, and did not<br/>want to hear more;—and the voices of the ladies were drowned for a<br/>while, till another suspension brought Mrs. Elton's tones again<br/>distinctly forward.—Mr. Elton had just joined them, and his wife<br/>was exclaiming,<br/><br/>"Oh! you have found us out at last, have you, in our seclusion?—<br/>I was this moment telling Jane, I thought you would begin to be<br/>impatient for tidings of us."<br/><br/>"Jane!"—repeated Frank Churchill, with a look of surprize and<br/>displeasure.— "That is easy—but Miss Fairfax does not disapprove<br/>it, I suppose."<br/><br/>"How do you like Mrs. Elton?" said Emma in a whisper.<br/><br/>"Not at all."<br/><br/>"You are ungrateful."<br/><br/>"Ungrateful!—What do you mean?" Then changing from a frown to a<br/>smile—"No, do not tell me—I do not want to know what you mean.—<br/>Where is my father?—When are we to begin dancing?"<br/><br/>Emma could hardly understand him; he seemed in an odd humour. He<br/>walked off to find his father, but was quickly back again with both<br/>Mr. and Mrs. Weston. He had met with them in a little perplexity,<br/>which must be laid before Emma. It had just occurred to Mrs. Weston<br/>that Mrs. Elton must be asked to begin the ball; that she would<br/>expect it; which interfered with all their wishes of giving Emma<br/>that distinction.—Emma heard the sad truth with fortitude.<br/><br/>
