"I not aware!" said Jane, shaking her head; "dear Mrs. Elton,
who can have thought of it as I have done?"

"But you have not seen so much of the world as I have. You do
not know how many candidates there always are for the first
situations. I saw a vast deal of that in the neighbourhood round
Maple Grove. A cousin of Mr. Suckling, Mrs. Bragge, had such an
infinity of applications; every body was anxious to be in her
family, for she moves in the first circle. Wax-candles in the
schoolroom! You may imagine how desirable! Of all houses in the
kingdom Mrs. Bragge's is the one I would most wish to see you
in."

"Colonel and Mrs. Campbell are to be in town again by
midsummer," said Jane. "I must spend some time with them; I am sure
they will want it;—afterwards I may probably be glad to dispose of
myself. But I would not wish you to take the trouble of making any
inquiries at present."

"Trouble! aye, I know your scruples. You are afraid of giving me
trouble; but I assure you, my dear Jane, the Campbells can hardly
be more interested about you than I am. I shall write to Mrs.
Partridge in a day or two, and shall give her a strict charge to be
on the look-out for any thing eligible."

"Thank you, but I would rather you did not mention the subject
to her; till the time draws nearer, I do not wish to be giving any
body trouble."

"But, my dear child, the time is drawing near; here is April,
and June, or say even July, is very near, with such business to
accomplish before us. Your inexperience really amuses me! A
situation such as you deserve, and your friends would require for
you, is no everyday occurrence, is not obtained at a moment's
notice; indeed, indeed, we must begin inquiring directly."

"Excuse me, ma'am, but this is by no means my intention; I make
no inquiry myself, and should be sorry to have any made by my
friends. When I am quite determined as to the time, I am not at all
afraid of being long unemployed. There are places in town, offices,
where inquiry would soon produce something—Offices for the sale—
not quite of human flesh—but of human intellect."

"Oh! my dear, human flesh! You quite shock me; if you mean a
fling at the slave-trade, I assure you Mr. Suckling was always
rather a friend to the abolition."

"I did not mean, I was not thinking of the slave-trade," replied
Jane; "governess-trade, I assure you, was all that I had in view;
widely different certainly as to the guilt of those who carry it
on; but as to the greater misery of the victims, I do not know
where it lies. But I only mean to say that there are advertising
offices, and that by applying to them I should have no doubt of
very soon meeting with something that would do."

"Something that would do!" repeated Mrs. Elton. "Aye, that may
suit your humble ideas of yourself;—I know what a modest creature
you are; but it will not satisfy your friends to have you taking up
with any thing that may offer, any inferior, commonplace situation,
in a family not moving in a certain circle, or able to command the
elegancies of life."

"You are very obliging; but as to all that, I am very
indifferent; it would be no object to me to be with the rich; my
mortifications, I think, would only be the greater; I should suffer
more from comparison. A gentleman's family is all that I should
condition for."
