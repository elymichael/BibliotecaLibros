"Upon my word," exclaimed Emma, "you amuse me! I should like to<br/>know how many of all my numerous engagements take place without<br/>your being of the party; and why I am to be supposed in danger of<br/>wanting leisure to attend to the little boys. These amazing<br/>engagements of mine— what have they been? Dining once with the<br/>Coles—and having a ball talked of, which never took place. I can<br/>understand you—(nodding at Mr. John Knightley)—your good fortune in<br/>meeting with so many of your friends at once here, delights you too<br/>much to pass unnoticed. But you, (turning to Mr. Knightley,) who<br/>know how very, very seldom I am ever two hours from Hartfield, why<br/>you should foresee such a series of dissipation for me, I cannot<br/>imagine. And as to my dear little boys, I must say, that if Aunt<br/>Emma has not time for them, I do not think they would fare much<br/>better with Uncle Knightley, who is absent from home about five<br/>hours where she is absent one— and who, when he is at home, is<br/>either reading to himself or settling his accounts."<br/><br/>Mr. Knightley seemed to be trying not to smile; and succeeded<br/>without difficulty, upon Mrs. Elton's beginning to talk to him.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
