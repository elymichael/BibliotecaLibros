<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>18<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>Mr. Frank Churchill did not come. When the time proposed drew<br/>near, Mrs. Weston's fears were justified in the arrival of a letter<br/>of excuse. For the present, he could not be spared, to his "very<br/>great mortification and regret; but still he looked forward with<br/>the hope of coming to Randalls at no distant period."<br/><br/>Mrs. Weston was exceedingly disappointedâ€”much more disappointed,<br/>in fact, than her husband, though her dependence on seeing the<br/>young man had been so much more sober: but a sanguine temper,<br/>though for ever expecting more good than occurs, does not always<br/>pay for its hopes by any proportionate depression. It soon flies<br/>over the present failure, and begins to hope again. For half an<br/>hour Mr. Weston was surprized and sorry; but then he began to<br/>perceive that Frank's coming two or three months later would be a<br/>much better plan; better time of year; better weather; and that he<br/>would be able, without any doubt, to stay considerably longer with<br/>them than if he had come sooner.<br/><br/>These feelings rapidly restored his comfort, while Mrs. Weston,<br/>of a more apprehensive disposition, foresaw nothing but a<br/>repetition of excuses and delays; and after all her concern for<br/>what her husband was to suffer, suffered a great deal more<br/>herself.<br/><br/>Emma was not at this time in a state of spirits to care really<br/>about Mr. Frank Churchill's not coming, except as a disappointment<br/>at Randalls. The acquaintance at present had no charm for her. She<br/>wanted, rather, to be quiet, and out of temptation; but still, as<br/>it was desirable that she should appear, in general, like her usual<br/>self, she took care to express as much interest in the<br/>circumstance, and enter as warmly into Mr. and Mrs. Weston's<br/>disappointment, as might naturally belong to their friendship.<br/><br/>She was the first to announce it to Mr. Knightley; and exclaimed<br/>quite as much as was necessary, (or, being acting a part, perhaps<br/>rather more,) at the conduct of the Churchills, in keeping him<br/>away. She then proceeded to say a good deal more than she felt, of<br/>the advantage of such an addition to their confined society in<br/>Surry; the pleasure of looking at somebody new; the gala-day to<br/>Highbury entire, which the sight of him would have made; and ending<br/>with reflections on the Churchills again, found herself directly<br/>involved in a disagreement with Mr. Knightley; and, to her great<br/>amusement, perceived that she was taking the other side of the<br/>question from her real opinion, and making use of Mrs. Weston's<br/>arguments against herself.<br/><br/>"The Churchills are very likely in fault," said Mr. Knightley,<br/>coolly; "but I dare say he might come if he would."<br/><br/>
