"Ah!—well—to be sure. Yes, I see what she means, (turning to Mr.<br/>Knightley,) and I will try to hold my tongue. I must make myself<br/>very disagreeable, or she would not have said such a thing to an<br/>old friend."<br/><br/>"I like your plan," cried Mr. Weston. "Agreed, agreed. I will do<br/>my best. I am making a conundrum. How will a conundrum reckon?"<br/><br/>"Low, I am afraid, sir, very low," answered his son;—"but we<br/>shall be indulgent—especially to any one who leads the way."<br/><br/>"No, no," said Emma, "it will not reckon low. A conundrum of Mr.<br/>Weston's shall clear him and his next neighbour. Come, sir, pray<br/>let me hear it."<br/><br/>"I doubt its being very clever myself," said Mr. Weston. "It is<br/>too much a matter of fact, but here it is.—What two letters of the<br/>alphabet are there, that express perfection?"<br/><br/>"What two letters!—express perfection! I am sure I do not<br/>know."<br/><br/>"Ah! you will never guess. You, (to Emma), I am certain, will<br/>never guess.—I will tell you.—M. and A.—Em-ma.—Do you<br/>understand?"<br/><br/>Understanding and gratification came together. It might be a<br/>very indifferent piece of wit, but Emma found a great deal to laugh<br/>at and enjoy in it—and so did Frank and Harriet.—It did not seem to<br/>touch the rest of the party equally; some looked very stupid about<br/>it, and Mr. Knightley gravely said,<br/><br/>"This explains the sort of clever thing that is wanted, and Mr.<br/>Weston has done very well for himself; but he must have knocked up<br/>every body else. Perfection should not have come quite so<br/>soon."<br/><br/>"Oh! for myself, I protest I must be excused," said Mrs. Elton;<br/>"I really cannot attempt—I am not at all fond of the sort of thing.<br/>I had an acrostic once sent to me upon my own name, which I was not<br/>at all pleased with. I knew who it came from. An abominable puppy!—<br/>You know who I mean (nodding to her husband). These kind of things<br/>are very well at Christmas, when one is sitting round the fire; but<br/>quite out of place, in my opinion, when one is exploring about the<br/>country in summer. Miss Woodhouse must excuse me. I am not one of<br/>those who have witty things at every body's service. I do not<br/>pretend to be a wit. I have a great deal of vivacity in my own way,<br/>but I really must be allowed to judge when to speak and when to<br/>hold my tongue. Pass us, if you please, Mr. Churchill. Pass Mr. E.,<br/>Knightley, Jane, and myself. We have nothing clever to say— not one<br/>of us.<br/><br/>"Yes, yes, pray pass me," added her husband, with a sort of<br/>sneering consciousness; "I have nothing to say that can entertain<br/>Miss Woodhouse, or any other young lady. An old married man— quite<br/>good for nothing. Shall we walk, Augusta?"<br/>
