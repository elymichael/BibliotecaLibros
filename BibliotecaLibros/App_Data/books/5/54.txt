Mr. Woodhouse could never allow for Mr. Knightley's claims on
his brother, or any body's claims on Isabella, except his own. He
sat musing a little while, and then said,

"But I do not see why poor Isabella should be obliged to go back
so soon, though he does. I think, Emma, I shall try and persuade
her to stay longer with us. She and the children might stay very
well."

"Ah! papa—that is what you never have been able to accomplish,
and I do not think you ever will. Isabella cannot bear to stay
behind her husband."

This was too true for contradiction. Unwelcome as it was, Mr.
Woodhouse could only give a submissive sigh; and as Emma saw his
spirits affected by the idea of his daughter's attachment to her
husband, she immediately led to such a branch of the subject as
must raise them.

"Harriet must give us as much of her company as she can while my
brother and sister are here. I am sure she will be pleased with the
children. We are very proud of the children, are not we, papa? I
wonder which she will think the handsomest, Henry or John?"

"Aye, I wonder which she will. Poor little dears, how glad they
will be to come. They are very fond of being at Hartfield,
Harriet."

"I dare say they are, sir. I am sure I do not know who is
not."

"Henry is a fine boy, but John is very like his mama. Henry is
the eldest, he was named after me, not after his father. John, the
second, is named after his father. Some people are surprized, I
believe, that the eldest was not, but Isabella would have him
called Henry, which I thought very pretty of her. And he is a very
clever boy, indeed. They are all remarkably clever; and they have
so many pretty ways. They will come and stand by my chair, and say,
`Grandpapa, can you give me a bit of string?' and once Henry asked
me for a knife, but I told him knives were only made for
grandpapas. I think their father is too rough with them very
often."

"He appears rough to you," said Emma, "because you are so very
gentle yourself; but if you could compare him with other papas, you
would not think him rough. He wishes his boys to be active and
hardy; and if they misbehave, can give them a sharp word now and
then; but he is an affectionate father—certainly Mr. John Knightley
is an affectionate father. The children are all fond of him."

"And then their uncle comes in, and tosses them up to the
ceiling in a very frightful way!"

"But they like it, papa; there is nothing they like so much. It
is such enjoyment to them, that if their uncle did not lay down the
rule of their taking turns, whichever began would never give way to
the other."
