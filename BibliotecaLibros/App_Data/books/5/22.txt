"Emma has been meaning to read more ever since she was twelve
years old. I have seen a great many lists of her drawing-up at
various times of books that she meant to read regularly through—and
very good lists they were—very well chosen, and very neatly
arranged—sometimes alphabetically, and sometimes by some other
rule. The list she drew up when only fourteen—I remember thinking
it did her judgment so much credit, that I preserved it some time;
and I dare say she may have made out a very good list now. But I
have done with expecting any course of steady reading from Emma.
She will never submit to any thing requiring industry and patience,
and a subjection of the fancy to the understanding. Where Miss
Taylor failed to stimulate, I may safely affirm that Harriet Smith
will do nothing.—You never could persuade her to read half so much
as you wished.—You know you could not."

"I dare say," replied Mrs. Weston, smiling, "that I thought so
then;—but since we have parted, I can never remember Emma's
omitting to do any thing I wished."

"There is hardly any desiring to refresh such a memory as
that,"—said Mr. Knightley, feelingly; and for a moment or two he
had done. "But I," he soon added, "who have had no such charm
thrown over my senses, must still see, hear, and remember. Emma is
spoiled by being the cleverest of her family. At ten years old, she
had the misfortune of being able to answer questions which puzzled
her sister at seventeen. She was always quick and assured: Isabella
slow and diffident. And ever since she was twelve, Emma has been
mistress of the house and of you all. In her mother she lost the
only person able to cope with her. She inherits her mother's
talents, and must have been under subjection to her."

"I should have been sorry, Mr. Knightley, to be dependent on
your recommendation, had I quitted Mr. Woodhouse's family and
wanted another situation; I do not think you would have spoken a
good word for me to any body. I am sure you always thought me unfit
for the office I held."

"Yes," said he, smiling. "You are better placed here; very fit
for a wife, but not at all for a governess. But you were preparing
yourself to be an excellent wife all the time you were at
Hartfield. You might not give Emma such a complete education as
your powers would seem to promise; but you were receiving a very
good education from her, on the very material matrimonial point of
submitting your own will, and doing as you were bid; and if Weston
had asked me to recommend him a wife, I should certainly have named
Miss Taylor."

"Thank you. There will be very little merit in making a good
wife to such a man as Mr. Weston."

"Why, to own the truth, I am afraid you are rather thrown away,
and that with every disposition to bear, there will be nothing to
be borne. We will not despair, however. Weston may grow cross from
the wantonness of comfort, or his son may plague him."

"I hope not that.—It is not likely. No, Mr. Knightley, do not
foretell vexation from that quarter."

"Not I, indeed. I only name possibilities. I do not pretend to
Emma's genius for foretelling and guessing. I hope, with all my
heart, the young man may be a Weston in merit, and a Churchill in
fortune.—But Harriet Smith—I have not half done about Harriet
Smith. I think her the very worst sort of companion that Emma could
possibly have. She knows nothing herself, and looks upon Emma as
knowing every thing. She is a flatterer in all her ways; and so
much the worse, because undesigned. Her ignorance is hourly
flattery. How can Emma imagine she has any thing to learn herself,
while Harriet is presenting such a delightful inferiority? And as
for Harriet, I will venture to say that she cannot gain by the
acquaintance. Hartfield will only put her out of conceit with all
the other places she belongs to. She will grow just refined enough
to be uncomfortable with those among whom birth and circumstances
have placed her home. I am much mistaken if Emma's doctrines give
any strength of mind, or tend at all to make a girl adapt herself
rationally to the varieties of her situation in life.—They only
give a little polish."

"I either depend more upon Emma's good sense than you do, or am
more anxious for her present comfort; for I cannot lament the
acquaintance. How well she looked last night!"

"Oh! you would rather talk of her person than her mind, would
you? Very well; I shall not attempt to deny Emma's being
pretty."
