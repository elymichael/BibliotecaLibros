<br/>"I must not hope to be ever situated as you are, in the midst of<br/>every dearest connexion, and therefore I cannot expect that simply<br/>growing older should make me indifferent about letters."<br/><br/>"Indifferent! Oh! no—I never conceived you could become<br/>indifferent. Letters are no matter of indifference; they are<br/>generally a very positive curse."<br/><br/>"You are speaking of letters of business; mine are letters of<br/>friendship."<br/><br/>"I have often thought them the worst of the two," replied he<br/>coolly. "Business, you know, may bring money, but friendship hardly<br/>ever does."<br/><br/>"Ah! you are not serious now. I know Mr. John Knightley too<br/>well— I am very sure he understands the value of friendship as well<br/>as any body. I can easily believe that letters are very little to<br/>you, much less than to me, but it is not your being ten years older<br/>than myself which makes the difference, it is not age, but<br/>situation. You have every body dearest to you always at hand, I,<br/>probably, never shall again; and therefore till I have outlived all<br/>my affections, a post-office, I think, must always have power to<br/>draw me out, in worse weather than to-day."<br/><br/>"When I talked of your being altered by time, by the progress of<br/>years," said John Knightley, "I meant to imply the change of<br/>situation which time usually brings. I consider one as including<br/>the other. Time will generally lessen the interest of every<br/>attachment not within the daily circle—but that is not the change I<br/>had in view for you. As an old friend, you will allow me to hope,<br/>Miss Fairfax, that ten years hence you may have as many<br/>concentrated objects as I have."<br/><br/>It was kindly said, and very far from giving offence. A pleasant<br/>"thank you" seemed meant to laugh it off, but a blush, a quivering<br/>lip, a tear in the eye, shewed that it was felt beyond a laugh. Her<br/>attention was now claimed by Mr. Woodhouse, who being, according to<br/>his custom on such occasions, making the circle of his guests, and<br/>paying his particular compliments to the ladies, was ending with<br/>her—and with all his mildest urbanity, said,<br/><br/>"I am very sorry to hear, Miss Fairfax, of your being out this<br/>morning in the rain. Young ladies should take care of themselves.—<br/>Young ladies are delicate plants. They should take care of their<br/>health and their complexion. My dear, did you change your<br/>stockings?"<br/><br/>"Yes, sir, I did indeed; and I am very much obliged by your kind<br/>solicitude about me."<br/><br/>"My dear Miss Fairfax, young ladies are very sure to be cared<br/>for.— I hope your good grand-mama and aunt are well. They are some<br/>of my very old friends. I wish my health allowed me to be a better<br/>neighbour. You do us a great deal of honour to-day, I am sure. My<br/>daughter and I are both highly sensible of your goodness, and have<br/>the greatest satisfaction in seeing you at Hartfield."<br/><br/>
