<br/>"I never should have presumed to think of it at first," said<br/>she, "but for you. You told me to observe him carefully, and let<br/>his behaviour be the rule of mine—and so I have. But now I seem to<br/>feel that I may deserve him; and that if he does chuse me, it will<br/>not be any thing so very wonderful."<br/><br/>The bitter feelings occasioned by this speech, the many bitter<br/>feelings, made the utmost exertion necessary on Emma's side, to<br/>enable her to say on reply,<br/><br/>"Harriet, I will only venture to declare, that Mr. Knightley is<br/>the last man in the world, who would intentionally give any woman<br/>the idea of his feeling for her more than he really does."<br/><br/>Harriet seemed ready to worship her friend for a sentence so<br/>satisfactory; and Emma was only saved from raptures and fondness,<br/>which at that moment would have been dreadful penance, by the sound<br/>of her father's footsteps. He was coming through the hall. Harriet<br/>was too much agitated to encounter him. "She could not compose<br/>herself— Mr. Woodhouse would be alarmed—she had better go;"—with<br/>most ready encouragement from her friend, therefore, she passed off<br/>through another door—and the moment she was gone, this was the<br/>spontaneous burst of Emma's feelings: "Oh God! that I had never<br/>seen her!"<br/><br/>The rest of the day, the following night, were hardly enough for<br/>her thoughts.—She was bewildered amidst the confusion of all that<br/>had rushed on her within the last few hours. Every moment had<br/>brought a fresh surprize; and every surprize must be matter of<br/>humiliation to her.—How to understand it all! How to understand the<br/>deceptions she had been thus practising on herself, and living<br/>under!—The blunders, the blindness of her own head and heart!—she<br/>sat still, she walked about, she tried her own room, she tried the<br/>shrubbery—in every place, every posture, she perceived that she had<br/>acted most weakly; that she had been imposed on by others in a most<br/>mortifying degree; that she had been imposing on herself in a<br/>degree yet more mortifying; that she was wretched, and should<br/>probably find this day but the beginning of wretchedness.<br/><br/>To understand, thoroughly understand her own heart, was the<br/>first endeavour. To that point went every leisure moment which her<br/>father's claims on her allowed, and every moment of involuntary<br/>absence of mind.<br/><br/>How long had Mr. Knightley been so dear to her, as every feeling<br/>declared him now to be? When had his influence, such influence<br/>begun?— When had he succeeded to that place in her affection, which<br/>Frank Churchill had once, for a short period, occupied?—She looked<br/>back; she compared the two—compared them, as they had always stood<br/>in her estimation, from the time of the latter's becoming known to<br/>her— and as they must at any time have been compared by her, had<br/>it— oh! had it, by any blessed felicity, occurred to her, to<br/>institute the comparison.—She saw that there never had been a time<br/>when she did not consider Mr. Knightley as infinitely the superior,<br/>or when his regard for her had not been infinitely the most dear.<br/>She saw, that in persuading herself, in fancying, in acting to the<br/>contrary, she had been entirely under a delusion, totally ignorant<br/>of her own heart—and, in short, that she had never really cared for<br/>Frank Churchill at all!<br/><br/>This was the conclusion of the first series of reflection. This<br/>was the knowledge of herself, on the first question of inquiry,<br/>which she reached; and without being long in reaching it.— She was<br/>most sorrowfully indignant; ashamed of every sensation but the one<br/>revealed to her—her affection for Mr. Knightley.— Every other part<br/>of her mind was disgusting.<br/><br/>With insufferable vanity had she believed herself in the secret<br/>of every body's feelings; with unpardonable arrogance proposed to<br/>arrange every body's destiny. She was proved to have been<br/>universally mistaken; and she had not quite done nothing—for she<br/>had done mischief. She had brought evil on Harriet, on herself, and<br/>she too much feared, on Mr. Knightley.—Were this most unequal of<br/>all connexions to take place, on her must rest all the reproach of<br/>having given it a beginning; for his attachment, she must believe<br/>to be produced only by a consciousness of Harriet's;—and even were<br/>this not the case, he would never have known Harriet at all but for<br/>her folly.<br/><br/>Mr. Knightley and Harriet Smith!—It was a union to distance<br/>every wonder of the kind.—The attachment of Frank Churchill and<br/>Jane Fairfax became commonplace, threadbare, stale in the<br/>comparison, exciting no surprize, presenting no disparity,<br/>affording nothing to be said or thought.—Mr. Knightley and Harriet<br/>Smith!—Such an elevation on her side! Such a debasement on his! It<br/>was horrible to Emma to think how it must sink him in the general<br/>opinion, to foresee the smiles, the sneers, the merriment it would<br/>prompt at his expense; the mortification and disdain of his<br/>brother, the thousand inconveniences to himself.—Could it be?—No;<br/>it was impossible. And yet it was far, very far, from<br/>impossible.—Was it a new circumstance for a man of first-rate<br/>abilities to be captivated by very inferior powers? Was it new for<br/>one, perhaps too busy to seek, to be the prize of a girl who would<br/>seek him?—Was it new for any thing in this world to be unequal,<br/>inconsistent, incongruous—or for chance and circumstance (as second<br/>causes) to direct the human fate?<br/><br/>
