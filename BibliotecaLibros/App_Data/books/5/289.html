Jane Fairfax had already quitted Highbury, and was restored to<br/>the comforts of her beloved home with the Campbells.—The Mr.<br/>Churchills were also in town; and they were only waiting for<br/>November.<br/><br/>The intermediate month was the one fixed on, as far as they<br/>dared, by Emma and Mr. Knightley.—They had determined that their<br/>marriage ought to be concluded while John and Isabella were still<br/>at Hartfield, to allow them the fortnight's absence in a tour to<br/>the seaside, which was the plan.—John and Isabella, and every other<br/>friend, were agreed in approving it. But Mr. Woodhouse—how was Mr.<br/>Woodhouse to be induced to consent?—he, who had never yet alluded<br/>to their marriage but as a distant event.<br/><br/>When first sounded on the subject, he was so miserable, that<br/>they were almost hopeless.—A second allusion, indeed, gave less<br/>pain.— He began to think it was to be, and that he could not<br/>prevent it— a very promising step of the mind on its way to<br/>resignation. Still, however, he was not happy. Nay, he appeared so<br/>much otherwise, that his daughter's courage failed. She could not<br/>bear to see him suffering, to know him fancying himself neglected;<br/>and though her understanding almost acquiesced in the assurance of<br/>both the Mr. Knightleys, that when once the event were over, his<br/>distress would be soon over too, she hesitated—she could not<br/>proceed.<br/><br/>In this state of suspense they were befriended, not by any<br/>sudden illumination of Mr. Woodhouse's mind, or any wonderful<br/>change of his nervous system, but by the operation of the same<br/>system in another way.— Mrs. Weston's poultry-house was robbed one<br/>night of all her turkeys— evidently by the ingenuity of man. Other<br/>poultry-yards in the neighbourhood also suffered.—Pilfering was<br/>housebreaking to Mr. Woodhouse's fears.—He was very uneasy; and but<br/>for the sense of his son-in-law's protection, would have been under<br/>wretched alarm every night of his life. The strength, resolution,<br/>and presence of mind of the Mr. Knightleys, commanded his fullest<br/>dependence. While either of them protected him and his, Hartfield<br/>was safe.— But Mr. John Knightley must be in London again by the<br/>end of the first week in November.<br/><br/>The result of this distress was, that, with a much more<br/>voluntary, cheerful consent than his daughter had ever presumed to<br/>hope for at the moment, she was able to fix her wedding-day—and Mr.<br/>Elton was called on, within a month from the marriage of Mr. and<br/>Mrs. Robert Martin, to join the hands of Mr. Knightley and Miss<br/>Woodhouse.<br/><br/>The wedding was very much like other weddings, where the parties<br/>have no taste for finery or parade; and Mrs. Elton, from the<br/>particulars detailed by her husband, thought it all extremely<br/>shabby, and very inferior to her own.—"Very little white satin,<br/>very few lace veils; a most pitiful business!—Selina would stare<br/>when she heard of it."—But, in spite of these deficiencies, the<br/>wishes, the hopes, the confidence, the predictions of the small<br/>band of true friends who witnessed the ceremony, were fully<br/>answered in the perfect happiness of the union.<br/><br/>FINIS<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
