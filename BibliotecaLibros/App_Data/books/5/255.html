<br/>The evening of this day was very long, and melancholy, at<br/>Hartfield. The weather added what it could of gloom. A cold stormy<br/>rain set in, and nothing of July appeared but in the trees and<br/>shrubs, which the wind was despoiling, and the length of the day,<br/>which only made such cruel sights the longer visible.<br/><br/>The weather affected Mr. Woodhouse, and he could only be kept<br/>tolerably comfortable by almost ceaseless attention on his<br/>daughter's side, and by exertions which had never cost her half so<br/>much before. It reminded her of their first forlorn tete-a-tete, on<br/>the evening of Mrs. Weston's wedding-day; but Mr. Knightley had<br/>walked in then, soon after tea, and dissipated every melancholy<br/>fancy. Alas! such delightful proofs of Hartfield's attraction, as<br/>those sort of visits conveyed, might shortly be over. The picture<br/>which she had then drawn of the privations of the approaching<br/>winter, had proved erroneous; no friends had deserted them, no<br/>pleasures had been lost.—But her present forebodings she feared<br/>would experience no similar contradiction. The prospect before her<br/>now, was threatening to a degree that could not be entirely<br/>dispelled— that might not be even partially brightened. If all took<br/>place that might take place among the circle of her friends,<br/>Hartfield must be comparatively deserted; and she left to cheer her<br/>father with the spirits only of ruined happiness.<br/><br/>The child to be born at Randalls must be a tie there even dearer<br/>than herself; and Mrs. Weston's heart and time would be occupied by<br/>it. They should lose her; and, probably, in great measure, her<br/>husband also.—Frank Churchill would return among them no more; and<br/>Miss Fairfax, it was reasonable to suppose, would soon cease to<br/>belong to Highbury. They would be married, and settled either at or<br/>near Enscombe. All that were good would be withdrawn; and if to<br/>these losses, the loss of Donwell were to be added, what would<br/>remain of cheerful or of rational society within their reach? Mr.<br/>Knightley to be no longer coming there for his evening comfort!— No<br/>longer walking in at all hours, as if ever willing to change his<br/>own home for their's!—How was it to be endured? And if he were to<br/>be lost to them for Harriet's sake; if he were to be thought of<br/>hereafter, as finding in Harriet's society all that he wanted; if<br/>Harriet were to be the chosen, the first, the dearest, the friend,<br/>the wife to whom he looked for all the best blessings of existence;<br/>what could be increasing Emma's wretchedness but the reflection<br/>never far distant from her mind, that it had been all her own<br/>work?<br/><br/>When it came to such a pitch as this, she was not able to<br/>refrain from a start, or a heavy sigh, or even from walking about<br/>the room for a few seconds—and the only source whence any thing<br/>like consolation or composure could be drawn, was in the resolution<br/>of her own better conduct, and the hope that, however inferior in<br/>spirit and gaiety might be the following and every future winter of<br/>her life to the past, it would yet find her more rational, more<br/>acquainted with herself, and leave her less to regret when it were<br/>gone.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
