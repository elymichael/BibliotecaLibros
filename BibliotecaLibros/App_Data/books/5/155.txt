"My father and Mrs. Weston are at the Crown at this moment,"
said Frank Churchill, "examining the capabilities of the house. I
left them there and came on to Hartfield, impatient for your
opinion, and hoping you might be persuaded to join them and give
your advice on the spot. I was desired to say so from both. It
would be the greatest pleasure to them, if you could allow me to
attend you there. They can do nothing satisfactorily without
you."

Emma was most happy to be called to such a council; and her
father, engaging to think it all over while she was gone, the two
young people set off together without delay for the Crown. There
were Mr. and Mrs. Weston; delighted to see her and receive her
approbation, very busy and very happy in their different way; she,
in some little distress; and he, finding every thing perfect.

"Emma," said she, "this paper is worse than I expected. Look! in
places you see it is dreadfully dirty; and the wainscot is more
yellow and forlorn than any thing I could have imagined."

"My dear, you are too particular," said her husband. "What does
all that signify? You will see nothing of it by candlelight. It
will be as clean as Randalls by candlelight. We never see any thing
of it on our club-nights."

The ladies here probably exchanged looks which meant, "Men never
know when things are dirty or not;" and the gentlemen perhaps
thought each to himself, "Women will have their little nonsenses
and needless cares."

One perplexity, however, arose, which the gentlemen did not
disdain. It regarded a supper-room. At the time of the ballroom's
being built, suppers had not been in question; and a small
card-room adjoining, was the only addition. What was to be done?
This card-room would be wanted as a card-room now; or, if cards
were conveniently voted unnecessary by their four selves, still was
it not too small for any comfortable supper? Another room of much
better size might be secured for the purpose; but it was at the
other end of the house, and a long awkward passage must be gone
through to get at it. This made a difficulty. Mrs. Weston was
afraid of draughts for the young people in that passage; and
neither Emma nor the gentlemen could tolerate the prospect of being
miserably crowded at supper.

Mrs. Weston proposed having no regular supper; merely
sandwiches, &amp;c., set out in the little room; but that was
scouted as a wretched suggestion. A private dance, without sitting
down to supper, was pronounced an infamous fraud upon the rights of
men and women; and Mrs. Weston must not speak of it again. She then
took another line of expediency, and looking into the doubtful
room, observed,

"I do not think it is so very small. We shall not be many, you
know."

And Mr. Weston at the same time, walking briskly with long steps
through the passage, was calling out,

"You talk a great deal of the length of this passage, my dear.
It is a mere nothing after all; and not the least draught from the
stairs."
