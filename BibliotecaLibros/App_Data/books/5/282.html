"Do you dare say this?" cried Mr. Knightley. "Do you dare to<br/>suppose me so great a blockhead, as not to know what a man is<br/>talking of?— What do you deserve?"<br/><br/>"Oh! I always deserve the best treatment, because I never put up<br/>with any other; and, therefore, you must give me a plain, direct<br/>answer. Are you quite sure that you understand the terms on which<br/>Mr. Martin and Harriet now are?"<br/><br/>"I am quite sure," he replied, speaking very distinctly, "that<br/>he told me she had accepted him; and that there was no obscurity,<br/>nothing doubtful, in the words he used; and I think I can give you<br/>a proof that it must be so. He asked my opinion as to what he was<br/>now to do. He knew of no one but Mrs. Goddard to whom he could<br/>apply for information of her relations or friends. Could I mention<br/>any thing more fit to be done, than to go to Mrs. Goddard? I<br/>assured him that I could not. Then, he said, he would endeavour to<br/>see her in the course of this day."<br/><br/>"I am perfectly satisfied," replied Emma, with the brightest<br/>smiles, "and most sincerely wish them happy."<br/><br/>"You are materially changed since we talked on this subject<br/>before."<br/><br/>"I hope so—for at that time I was a fool."<br/><br/>"And I am changed also; for I am now very willing to grant you<br/>all Harriet's good qualities. I have taken some pains for your<br/>sake, and for Robert Martin's sake, (whom I have always had reason<br/>to believe as much in love with her as ever,) to get acquainted<br/>with her. I have often talked to her a good deal. You must have<br/>seen that I did. Sometimes, indeed, I have thought you were half<br/>suspecting me of pleading poor Martin's cause, which was never the<br/>case; but, from all my observations, I am convinced of her being an<br/>artless, amiable girl, with very good notions, very seriously good<br/>principles, and placing her happiness in the affections and utility<br/>of domestic life.— Much of this, I have no doubt, she may thank you<br/>for."<br/><br/>"Me!" cried Emma, shaking her head.—"Ah! poor Harriet!"<br/><br/>She checked herself, however, and submitted quietly to a little<br/>more praise than she deserved.<br/><br/>Their conversation was soon afterwards closed by the entrance of<br/>her father. She was not sorry. She wanted to be alone. Her mind was<br/>in a state of flutter and wonder, which made it impossible for her<br/>to be collected. She was in dancing, singing, exclaiming spirits;<br/>and till she had moved about, and talked to herself, and laughed<br/>and reflected, she could be fit for nothing rational.<br/><br/>Her father's business was to announce James's being gone out to<br/>put the horses to, preparatory to their now daily drive to<br/>Randalls; and she had, therefore, an immediate excuse for<br/>disappearing.<br/>
