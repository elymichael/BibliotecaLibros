"Ah! you are an odd creature!" she cried, satisfied to have no
one preferred to herself.—"You are a humourist, and may say what
you like. Quite a humourist. Well, I shall bring Jane with me— Jane
and her aunt.—The rest I leave to you. I have no objections at all
to meeting the Hartfield family. Don't scruple. I know you are
attached to them."

"You certainly will meet them if I can prevail; and I shall call
on Miss Bates in my way home."

"That's quite unnecessary; I see Jane every day:—but as you
like. It is to be a morning scheme, you know, Knightley; quite a
simple thing. I shall wear a large bonnet, and bring one of my
little baskets hanging on my arm. Here,—probably this basket with
pink ribbon. Nothing can be more simple, you see. And Jane will
have such another. There is to be no form or parade—a sort of gipsy
party. We are to walk about your gardens, and gather the
strawberries ourselves, and sit under trees;—and whatever else you
may like to provide, it is to be all out of doors—a table spread in
the shade, you know. Every thing as natural and simple as possible.
Is not that your idea?"

"Not quite. My idea of the simple and the natural will be to
have the table spread in the dining-room. The nature and the
simplicity of gentlemen and ladies, with their servants and
furniture, I think is best observed by meals within doors. When you
are tired of eating strawberries in the garden, there shall be cold
meat in the house."

"Well—as you please; only don't have a great set out. And, by
the bye, can I or my housekeeper be of any use to you with our
opinion?— Pray be sincere, Knightley. If you wish me to talk to
Mrs. Hodges, or to inspect anything—"

"I have not the least wish for it, I thank you."

"Well—but if any difficulties should arise, my housekeeper is
extremely clever."

"I will answer for it, that mine thinks herself full as clever,
and would spurn any body's assistance."

"I wish we had a donkey. The thing would be for us all to come
on donkeys, Jane, Miss Bates, and me—and my caro sposo walking by.
I really must talk to him about purchasing a donkey. In a country
life I conceive it to be a sort of necessary; for, let a woman have
ever so many resources, it is not possible for her to be always
shut up at home;—and very long walks, you know—in summer there is
dust, and in winter there is dirt."

"You will not find either, between Donwell and Highbury. Donwell
Lane is never dusty, and now it is perfectly dry. Come on a donkey,
however, if you prefer it. You can borrow Mrs. Cole's. I would wish
every thing to be as much to your taste as possible."
