<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>3<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>This little explanation with Mr. Knightley gave Emma<br/>considerable pleasure. It was one of the agreeable recollections of<br/>the ball, which she walked about the lawn the next morning to<br/>enjoy.—She was extremely glad that they had come to so good an<br/>understanding respecting the Eltons, and that their opinions of<br/>both husband and wife were so much alike; and his praise of<br/>Harriet, his concession in her favour, was peculiarly gratifying.<br/>The impertinence of the Eltons, which for a few minutes had<br/>threatened to ruin the rest of her evening, had been the occasion<br/>of some of its highest satisfactions; and she looked forward to<br/>another happy result—the cure of Harriet's infatuation.— From<br/>Harriet's manner of speaking of the circumstance before they<br/>quitted the ballroom, she had strong hopes. It seemed as if her<br/>eyes were suddenly opened, and she were enabled to see that Mr.<br/>Elton was not the superior creature she had believed him. The fever<br/>was over, and Emma could harbour little fear of the pulse being<br/>quickened again by injurious courtesy. She depended on the evil<br/>feelings of the Eltons for supplying all the discipline of pointed<br/>neglect that could be farther requisite.—Harriet rational, Frank<br/>Churchill not too much in love, and Mr. Knightley not wanting to<br/>quarrel with her, how very happy a summer must be before her!<br/><br/>She was not to see Frank Churchill this morning. He had told her<br/>that he could not allow himself the pleasure of stopping at<br/>Hartfield, as he was to be at home by the middle of the day. She<br/>did not regret it.<br/><br/>Having arranged all these matters, looked them through, and put<br/>them all to rights, she was just turning to the house with spirits<br/>freshened up for the demands of the two little boys, as well as of<br/>their grandpapa, when the great iron sweep-gate opened, and two<br/>persons entered whom she had never less expected to see<br/>together—Frank Churchill, with Harriet leaning on his arm—actually<br/>Harriet!—A moment sufficed to convince her that something<br/>extraordinary had happened. Harriet looked white and frightened,<br/>and he was trying to cheer her.— The iron gates and the front-door<br/>were not twenty yards asunder;— they were all three soon in the<br/>hall, and Harriet immediately sinking into a chair fainted<br/>away.<br/><br/>A young lady who faints, must be recovered; questions must be<br/>answered, and surprizes be explained. Such events are very<br/>interesting, but the suspense of them cannot last long. A few<br/>minutes made Emma acquainted with the whole.<br/><br/>Miss Smith, and Miss Bickerton, another parlour boarder at Mrs.<br/>Goddard's, who had been also at the ball, had walked out together,<br/>and taken a road, the Richmond road, which, though apparently<br/>public enough for safety, had led them into alarm.—About half a<br/>mile beyond Highbury, making a sudden turn, and deeply shaded by<br/>elms on each side, it became for a considerable stretch very<br/>retired; and when the young ladies had advanced some way into it,<br/>they had suddenly perceived at a small distance before them, on a<br/>broader patch of greensward by the side, a party of gipsies. A<br/>child on the watch, came towards them to beg; and Miss Bickerton,<br/>excessively frightened, gave a great scream, and calling on Harriet<br/>to follow her, ran up a steep bank, cleared a slight hedge at the<br/>top, and made the best of her way by a short cut back to Highbury.<br/>But poor Harriet could not follow. She had suffered very much from<br/>cramp after dancing, and her first attempt to mount the bank<br/>brought on such a return of it as made her absolutely powerless—<br/>and in this state, and exceedingly terrified, she had been obliged<br/>to remain.<br/><br/>How the trampers might have behaved, had the young ladies been<br/>more courageous, must be doubtful; but such an invitation for<br/>attack could not be resisted; and Harriet was soon assailed by half<br/>a dozen children, headed by a stout woman and a great boy, all<br/>clamorous, and impertinent in look, though not absolutely in<br/>word.—More and more frightened, she immediately promised them<br/>money, and taking out her purse, gave them a shilling, and begged<br/>them not to want more, or to use her ill.—She was then able to<br/>walk, though but slowly, and was moving away—but her terror and her<br/>purse were too tempting, and she was followed, or rather<br/>surrounded, by the whole gang, demanding more.<br/><br/>
