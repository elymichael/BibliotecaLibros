<br/>"Mrs. Churchill is not much in my good graces, as you may<br/>suspect— but this is quite between ourselves. She is very fond of<br/>Frank, and therefore I would not speak ill of her. Besides, she is<br/>out of health now; but that indeed, by her own account, she has<br/>always been. I would not say so to every body, Mrs. Elton, but I<br/>have not much faith in Mrs. Churchill's illness."<br/><br/>"If she is really ill, why not go to Bath, Mr. Weston?—To Bath,<br/>or to Clifton?" "She has taken it into her head that Enscombe is<br/>too cold for her. The fact is, I suppose, that she is tired of<br/>Enscombe. She has now been a longer time stationary there, than she<br/>ever was before, and she begins to want change. It is a retired<br/>place. A fine place, but very retired."<br/><br/>"Aye—like Maple Grove, I dare say. Nothing can stand more<br/>retired from the road than Maple Grove. Such an immense plantation<br/>all round it! You seem shut out from every thing—in the most<br/>complete retirement.— And Mrs. Churchill probably has not health or<br/>spirits like Selina to enjoy that sort of seclusion. Or, perhaps<br/>she may not have resources enough in herself to be qualified for a<br/>country life. I always say a woman cannot have too many<br/>resources—and I feel very thankful that I have so many myself as to<br/>be quite independent of society."<br/><br/>"Frank was here in February for a fortnight."<br/><br/>"So I remember to have heard. He will find an addition to the<br/>society of Highbury when he comes again; that is, if I may presume<br/>to call myself an addition. But perhaps he may never have heard of<br/>there being such a creature in the world."<br/><br/>This was too loud a call for a compliment to be passed by, and<br/>Mr. Weston, with a very good grace, immediately exclaimed,<br/><br/>"My dear madam! Nobody but yourself could imagine such a thing<br/>possible. Not heard of you!—I believe Mrs. Weston's letters lately<br/>have been full of very little else than Mrs. Elton."<br/><br/>He had done his duty and could return to his son.<br/><br/>"When Frank left us," continued he, "it was quite uncertain when<br/>we might see him again, which makes this day's news doubly welcome.<br/>It has been completely unexpected. That is, I always had a strong<br/>persuasion he would be here again soon, I was sure something<br/>favourable would turn up—but nobody believed me. He and Mrs. Weston<br/>were both dreadfully desponding. `How could he contrive to come?<br/>And how could it be supposed that his uncle and aunt would spare<br/>him again?' and so forth—I always felt that something would happen<br/>in our favour; and so it has, you see. I have observed, Mrs. Elton,<br/>in the course of my life, that if things are going untowardly one<br/>month, they are sure to mend the next."<br/><br/>"Very true, Mr. Weston, perfectly true. It is just what I used<br/>to say to a certain gentleman in company in the days of courtship,<br/>when, because things did not go quite right, did not proceed with<br/>all the rapidity which suited his feelings, he was apt to be in<br/>despair, and exclaim that he was sure at this rate it would be May<br/>before Hymen's saffron robe would be put on for us. Oh! the pains I<br/>have been at to dispel those gloomy ideas and give him cheerfuller<br/>views! The carriage—we had disappointments about the carriage;—one<br/>morning, I remember, he came to me quite in despair."<br/><br/>
