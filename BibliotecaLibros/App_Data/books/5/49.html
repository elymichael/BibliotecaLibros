<br/>"I cannot make a question, or listen to a question about that.<br/>It is a certainty. Receive it on my judgment. It is a sort of<br/>prologue to the play, a motto to the chapter; and will be soon<br/>followed by matter-of-fact prose."<br/><br/>"It is a sort of thing which nobody could have expected. I am<br/>sure, a month ago, I had no more idea myself!—The strangest things<br/>do take place!"<br/><br/>"When Miss Smiths and Mr. Eltons get acquainted—they do<br/>indeed—and really it is strange; it is out of the common course<br/>that what is so evidently, so palpably desirable—what courts the<br/>pre-arrangement of other people, should so immediately shape itself<br/>into the proper form. You and Mr. Elton are by situation called<br/>together; you belong to one another by every circumstance of your<br/>respective homes. Your marrying will be equal to the match at<br/>Randalls. There does seem to be a something in the air of Hartfield<br/>which gives love exactly the right direction, and sends it into the<br/>very channel where it ought to flow.<br/><br/>The course of true love never did run smooth—<br/><br/>A Hartfield edition of Shakespeare would have a long note on<br/>that passage."<br/><br/>"That Mr. Elton should really be in love with me,—me, of all<br/>people, who did not know him, to speak to him, at Michaelmas! And<br/>he, the very handsomest man that ever was, and a man that every<br/>body looks up to, quite like Mr. Knightley! His company so sought<br/>after, that every body says he need not eat a single meal by<br/>himself if he does not chuse it; that he has more invitations than<br/>there are days in the week. And so excellent in the Church! Miss<br/>Nash has put down all the texts he has ever preached from since he<br/>came to Highbury. Dear me! When I look back to the first time I saw<br/>him! How little did I think!—The two Abbots and I ran into the<br/>front room and peeped through the blind when we heard he was going<br/>by, and Miss Nash came and scolded us away, and staid to look<br/>through herself; however, she called me back presently, and let me<br/>look too, which was very good-natured. And how beautiful we thought<br/>he looked! He was arm-in-arm with Mr. Cole."<br/><br/>"This is an alliance which, whoever—whatever your friends may<br/>be, must be agreeable to them, provided at least they have common<br/>sense; and we are not to be addressing our conduct to fools. If<br/>they are anxious to see you happily married, here is a man whose<br/>amiable character gives every assurance of it;—if they wish to have<br/>you settled in the same country and circle which they have chosen<br/>to place you in, here it will be accomplished; and if their only<br/>object is that you should, in the common phrase, be well married,<br/>here is the comfortable fortune, the respectable establishment, the<br/>rise in the world which must satisfy them."<br/><br/>"Yes, very true. How nicely you talk; I love to hear you. You<br/>understand every thing. You and Mr. Elton are one as clever as the<br/>other. This charade!—If I had studied a twelvemonth, I could never<br/>have made any thing like it."<br/><br/>"I thought he meant to try his skill, by his manner of declining<br/>it yesterday."<br/><br/>"I do think it is, without exception, the best charade I ever<br/>read."<br/><br/>
