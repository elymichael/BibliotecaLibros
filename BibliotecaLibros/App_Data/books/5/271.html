"He promised to come to me as soon as he could disengage himself<br/>from Knightley; but he and Knightley are shut up together in deep<br/>consultation.—Mr. E. is Knightley's right hand."<br/><br/>Emma would not have smiled for the world, and only said, "Is Mr.<br/>Elton gone on foot to Donwell?—He will have a hot walk."<br/><br/>"Oh! no, it is a meeting at the Crown, a regular meeting. Weston<br/>and Cole will be there too; but one is apt to speak only of those<br/>who lead.—I fancy Mr. E. and Knightley have every thing their own<br/>way."<br/><br/>"Have not you mistaken the day?" said Emma. "I am almost certain<br/>that the meeting at the Crown is not till to-morrow.—Mr. Knightley<br/>was at Hartfield yesterday, and spoke of it as for Saturday."<br/><br/>"Oh! no, the meeting is certainly to-day," was the abrupt<br/>answer, which denoted the impossibility of any blunder on Mrs.<br/>Elton's side.— "I do believe," she continued, "this is the most<br/>troublesome parish that ever was. We never heard of such things at<br/>Maple Grove."<br/><br/>"Your parish there was small," said Jane.<br/><br/>"Upon my word, my dear, I do not know, for I never heard the<br/>subject talked of."<br/><br/>"But it is proved by the smallness of the school, which I have<br/>heard you speak of, as under the patronage of your sister and Mrs.<br/>Bragge; the only school, and not more than five-and-twenty<br/>children."<br/><br/>"Ah! you clever creature, that's very true. What a thinking<br/>brain you have! I say, Jane, what a perfect character you and I<br/>should make, if we could be shaken together. My liveliness and your<br/>solidity would produce perfection.—Not that I presume to insinuate,<br/>however, that some people may not think you perfection already.—But<br/>hush!— not a word, if you please."<br/><br/>It seemed an unnecessary caution; Jane was wanting to give her<br/>words, not to Mrs. Elton, but to Miss Woodhouse, as the latter<br/>plainly saw. The wish of distinguishing her, as far as civility<br/>permitted, was very evident, though it could not often proceed<br/>beyond a look.<br/><br/>Mr. Elton made his appearance. His lady greeted him with some of<br/>her sparkling vivacity.<br/>
