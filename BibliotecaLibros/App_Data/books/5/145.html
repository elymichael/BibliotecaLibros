<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>10<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>The appearance of the little sitting-room as they entered, was<br/>tranquillity itself; Mrs. Bates, deprived of her usual employment,<br/>slumbering on one side of the fire, Frank Churchill, at a table<br/>near her, most deedily occupied about her spectacles, and Jane<br/>Fairfax, standing with her back to them, intent on her<br/>pianoforte.<br/><br/>Busy as he was, however, the young man was yet able to shew a<br/>most happy countenance on seeing Emma again.<br/><br/>"This is a pleasure," said he, in rather a low voice, "coming at<br/>least ten minutes earlier than I had calculated. You find me trying<br/>to be useful; tell me if you think I shall succeed."<br/><br/>"What!" said Mrs. Weston, "have not you finished it yet? you<br/>would not earn a very good livelihood as a working silversmith at<br/>this rate."<br/><br/>"I have not been working uninterruptedly," he replied, "I have<br/>been assisting Miss Fairfax in trying to make her instrument stand<br/>steadily, it was not quite firm; an unevenness in the floor, I<br/>believe. You see we have been wedging one leg with paper. This was<br/>very kind of you to be persuaded to come. I was almost afraid you<br/>would be hurrying home."<br/><br/>He contrived that she should be seated by him; and was<br/>sufficiently employed in looking out the best baked apple for her,<br/>and trying to make her help or advise him in his work, till Jane<br/>Fairfax was quite ready to sit down to the pianoforte again. That<br/>she was not immediately ready, Emma did suspect to arise from the<br/>state of her nerves; she had not yet possessed the instrument long<br/>enough to touch it without emotion; she must reason herself into<br/>the power of performance; and Emma could not but pity such<br/>feelings, whatever their origin, and could not but resolve never to<br/>expose them to her neighbour again.<br/><br/>
