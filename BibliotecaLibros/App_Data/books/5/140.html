"Oh! dear—I think you play the best of the two. I think you play<br/>quite as well as she does. I am sure I had much rather hear you.<br/>Every body last night said how well you played."<br/><br/>"Those who knew any thing about it, must have felt the<br/>difference. The truth is, Harriet, that my playing is just good<br/>enough to be praised, but Jane Fairfax's is much beyond it."<br/><br/>"Well, I always shall think that you play quite as well as she<br/>does, or that if there is any difference nobody would ever find it<br/>out. Mr. Cole said how much taste you had; and Mr. Frank Churchill<br/>talked a great deal about your taste, and that he valued taste much<br/>more than execution."<br/><br/>"Ah! but Jane Fairfax has them both, Harriet."<br/><br/>"Are you sure? I saw she had execution, but I did not know she<br/>had any taste. Nobody talked about it. And I hate Italian singing.—<br/>There is no understanding a word of it. Besides, if she does play<br/>so very well, you know, it is no more than she is obliged to do,<br/>because she will have to teach. The Coxes were wondering last night<br/>whether she would get into any great family. How did you think the<br/>Coxes looked?"<br/><br/>"Just as they always do—very vulgar."<br/><br/>"They told me something," said Harriet rather hesitatingly;" but<br/>it is nothing of any consequence."<br/><br/>Emma was obliged to ask what they had told her, though fearful<br/>of its producing Mr. Elton.<br/><br/>"They told me—that Mr. Martin dined with them last<br/>Saturday."<br/><br/>"Oh!"<br/><br/>"He came to their father upon some business, and he asked him to<br/>stay to dinner."<br/>
