During his present short stay, Emma had barely seen him; but<br/>just enough to feel that the first meeting was over, and to give<br/>her the impression of his not being improved by the mixture of<br/>pique and pretension, now spread over his air. She was, in fact,<br/>beginning very much to wonder that she had ever thought him<br/>pleasing at all; and his sight was so inseparably connected with<br/>some very disagreeable feelings, that, except in a moral light, as<br/>a penance, a lesson, a source of profitable humiliation to her own<br/>mind, she would have been thankful to be assured of never seeing<br/>him again. She wished him very well; but he gave her pain, and his<br/>welfare twenty miles off would administer most satisfaction.<br/><br/>The pain of his continued residence in Highbury, however, must<br/>certainly be lessened by his marriage. Many vain solicitudes would<br/>be prevented— many awkwardnesses smoothed by it. A Mrs. Elton would<br/>be an excuse for any change of intercourse; former intimacy might<br/>sink without remark. It would be almost beginning their life of<br/>civility again.<br/><br/>Of the lady, individually, Emma thought very little. She was<br/>good enough for Mr. Elton, no doubt; accomplished enough for<br/>Highbury— handsome enough—to look plain, probably, by Harriet's<br/>side. As to connexion, there Emma was perfectly easy; persuaded,<br/>that after all his own vaunted claims and disdain of Harriet, he<br/>had done nothing. On that article, truth seemed attainable. What<br/>she was, must be uncertain; but who she was, might be found out;<br/>and setting aside the 10,000 l., it did not appear that she was at<br/>all Harriet's superior. She brought no name, no blood, no alliance.<br/>Miss Hawkins was the youngest of the two daughters of a Bristol—<br/>merchant, of course, he must be called; but, as the whole of the<br/>profits of his mercantile life appeared so very moderate, it was<br/>not unfair to guess the dignity of his line of trade had been very<br/>moderate also. Part of every winter she had been used to spend in<br/>Bath; but Bristol was her home, the very heart of Bristol; for<br/>though the father and mother had died some years ago, an uncle<br/>remained— in the law line—nothing more distinctly honourable was<br/>hazarded of him, than that he was in the law line; and with him the<br/>daughter had lived. Emma guessed him to be the drudge of some<br/>attorney, and too stupid to rise. And all the grandeur of the<br/>connexion seemed dependent on the elder sister, who was very well<br/>married, to a gentleman in a great way, near Bristol, who kept two<br/>carriages! That was the wind-up of the history; that was the glory<br/>of Miss Hawkins.<br/><br/>Could she but have given Harriet her feelings about it all! She<br/>had talked her into love; but, alas! she was not so easily to be<br/>talked out of it. The charm of an object to occupy the many<br/>vacancies of Harriet's mind was not to be talked away. He might be<br/>superseded by another; he certainly would indeed; nothing could be<br/>clearer; even a Robert Martin would have been sufficient; but<br/>nothing else, she feared, would cure her. Harriet was one of those,<br/>who, having once begun, would be always in love. And now, poor<br/>girl! she was considerably worse from this reappearance of Mr.<br/>Elton. She was always having a glimpse of him somewhere or other.<br/>Emma saw him only once; but two or three times every day Harriet<br/>was sure just to meet with him, or just to miss him, just to hear<br/>his voice, or see his shoulder, just to have something occur to<br/>preserve him in her fancy, in all the favouring warmth of surprize<br/>and conjecture. She was, moreover, perpetually hearing about him;<br/>for, excepting when at Hartfield, she was always among those who<br/>saw no fault in Mr. Elton, and found nothing so interesting as the<br/>discussion of his concerns; and every report, therefore, every<br/>guess—all that had already occurred, all that might occur in the<br/>arrangement of his affairs, comprehending income, servants, and<br/>furniture, was continually in agitation around her. Her regard was<br/>receiving strength by invariable praise of him, and her regrets<br/>kept alive, and feelings irritated by ceaseless repetitions of Miss<br/>Hawkins's happiness, and continual observation of, how much he<br/>seemed attached!— his air as he walked by the house—the very<br/>sitting of his hat, being all in proof of how much he was in<br/>love!<br/><br/>Had it been allowable entertainment, had there been no pain to<br/>her friend, or reproach to herself, in the waverings of Harriet's<br/>mind, Emma would have been amused by its variations. Sometimes Mr.<br/>Elton predominated, sometimes the Martins; and each was<br/>occasionally useful as a check to the other. Mr. Elton's engagement<br/>had been the cure of the agitation of meeting Mr. Martin. The<br/>unhappiness produced by the knowledge of that engagement had been a<br/>little put aside by Elizabeth Martin's calling at Mrs. Goddard's a<br/>few days afterwards. Harriet had not been at home; but a note had<br/>been prepared and left for her, written in the very style to touch;<br/>a small mixture of reproach, with a great deal of kindness; and<br/>till Mr. Elton himself appeared, she had been much occupied by it,<br/>continually pondering over what could be done in return, and<br/>wishing to do more than she dared to confess. But Mr. Elton, in<br/>person, had driven away all such cares. While he staid, the Martins<br/>were forgotten; and on the very morning of his setting off for Bath<br/>again, Emma, to dissipate some of the distress it occasioned,<br/>judged it best for her to return Elizabeth Martin's visit.<br/><br/>How that visit was to be acknowledged—what would be necessary—<br/>and what might be safest, had been a point of some doubtful<br/>consideration. Absolute neglect of the mother and sisters, when<br/>invited to come, would be ingratitude. It must not be: and yet the<br/>danger of a renewal of the acquaintance!—<br/><br/>After much thinking, she could determine on nothing better, than<br/>Harriet's returning the visit; but in a way that, if they had<br/>understanding, should convince them that it was to be only a formal<br/>acquaintance. She meant to take her in the carriage, leave her at<br/>the Abbey Mill, while she drove a little farther, and call for her<br/>again so soon, as to allow no time for insidious applications or<br/>dangerous recurrences to the past, and give the most decided proof<br/>of what degree of intimacy was chosen for the future.<br/><br/>She could think of nothing better: and though there was<br/>something in it which her own heart could not approve—something of<br/>ingratitude, merely glossed over—it must be done, or what would<br/>become of Harriet?<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
