"Very well. I undertake the commission. You shall have a<br/>charming wife."<br/><br/>"She must be very lively, and have hazle eyes. I care for<br/>nothing else. I shall go abroad for a couple of years—and when I<br/>return, I shall come to you for my wife. Remember."<br/><br/>Emma was in no danger of forgetting. It was a commission to<br/>touch every favourite feeling. Would not Harriet be the very<br/>creature described? Hazle eyes excepted, two years more might make<br/>her all that he wished. He might even have Harriet in his thoughts<br/>at the moment; who could say? Referring the education to her seemed<br/>to imply it.<br/><br/>"Now, ma'am," said Jane to her aunt, "shall we join Mrs.<br/>Elton?"<br/><br/>"If you please, my dear. With all my heart. I am quite ready. I<br/>was ready to have gone with her, but this will do just as well. We<br/>shall soon overtake her. There she is—no, that's somebody else.<br/>That's one of the ladies in the Irish car party, not at all like<br/>her.— Well, I declare—"<br/><br/>They walked off, followed in half a minute by Mr. Knightley. Mr.<br/>Weston, his son, Emma, and Harriet, only remained; and the young<br/>man's spirits now rose to a pitch almost unpleasant. Even Emma grew<br/>tired at last of flattery and merriment, and wished herself rather<br/>walking quietly about with any of the others, or sitting almost<br/>alone, and quite unattended to, in tranquil observation of the<br/>beautiful views beneath her. The appearance of the servants looking<br/>out for them to give notice of the carriages was a joyful sight;<br/>and even the bustle of collecting and preparing to depart, and the<br/>solicitude of Mrs. Elton to have her carriage first, were gladly<br/>endured, in the prospect of the quiet drive home which was to close<br/>the very questionable enjoyments of this day of pleasure. Such<br/>another scheme, composed of so many ill-assorted people, she hoped<br/>never to be betrayed into again.<br/><br/>While waiting for the carriage, she found Mr. Knightley by her<br/>side. He looked around, as if to see that no one were near, and<br/>then said,<br/><br/>"Emma, I must once more speak to you as I have been used to do:<br/>a privilege rather endured than allowed, perhaps, but I must still<br/>use it. I cannot see you acting wrong, without a remonstrance. How<br/>could you be so unfeeling to Miss Bates? How could you be so<br/>insolent in your wit to a woman of her character, age, and<br/>situation?— Emma, I had not thought it possible."<br/><br/>Emma recollected, blushed, was sorry, but tried to laugh it<br/>off.<br/><br/>"Nay, how could I help saying what I did?—Nobody could have<br/>helped it. It was not so very bad. I dare say she did not<br/>understand me."<br/><br/>"I assure you she did. She felt your full meaning. She has<br/>talked of it since. I wish you could have heard how she talked of<br/>it— with what candour and generosity. I wish you could have heard<br/>her honouring your forbearance, in being able to pay her such<br/>attentions, as she was for ever receiving from yourself and your<br/>father, when her society must be so irksome."<br/>
