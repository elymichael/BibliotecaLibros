&#160;


Emma's pensive meditations, as she walked home, were not
interrupted; but on entering the parlour, she found those who must
rouse her. Mr. Knightley and Harriet had arrived during her
absence, and were sitting with her father.—Mr. Knightley
immediately got up, and in a manner decidedly graver than usual,
said,

"I would not go away without seeing you, but I have no time to
spare, and therefore must now be gone directly. I am going to
London, to spend a few days with John and Isabella. Have you any
thing to send or say, besides the `love,' which nobody
carries?"

"Nothing at all. But is not this a sudden scheme?"

"Yes—rather—I have been thinking of it some little time."

Emma was sure he had not forgiven her; he looked unlike himself.
Time, however, she thought, would tell him that they ought to be
friends again. While he stood, as if meaning to go, but not going—
her father began his inquiries.

"Well, my dear, and did you get there safely?—And how did you
find my worthy old friend and her daughter?—I dare say they must
have been very much obliged to you for coming. Dear Emma has been
to call on Mrs. and Miss Bates, Mr. Knightley, as I told you
before. She is always so attentive to them!"
