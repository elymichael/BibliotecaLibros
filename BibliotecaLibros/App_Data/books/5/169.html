"My brother and sister have promised us a visit in the spring,<br/>or summer at farthest," continued Mrs. Elton; "and that will be our<br/>time for exploring. While they are with us, we shall explore a<br/>great deal, I dare say. They will have their barouche-landau, of<br/>course, which holds four perfectly; and therefore, without saying<br/>any thing of our carriage, we should be able to explore the<br/>different beauties extremely well. They would hardly come in their<br/>chaise, I think, at that season of the year. Indeed, when the time<br/>draws on, I shall decidedly recommend their bringing the<br/>barouche-landau; it will be so very much preferable. When people<br/>come into a beautiful country of this sort, you know, Miss<br/>Woodhouse, one naturally wishes them to see as much as possible;<br/>and Mr. Suckling is extremely fond of exploring. We explored to<br/>King's-Weston twice last summer, in that way, most delightfully,<br/>just after their first having the barouche-landau. You have many<br/>parties of that kind here, I suppose, Miss Woodhouse, every<br/>summer?"<br/><br/>"No; not immediately here. We are rather out of distance of the<br/>very striking beauties which attract the sort of parties you speak<br/>of; and we are a very quiet set of people, I believe; more disposed<br/>to stay at home than engage in schemes of pleasure."<br/><br/>"Ah! there is nothing like staying at home for real comfort.<br/>Nobody can be more devoted to home than I am. I was quite a proverb<br/>for it at Maple Grove. Many a time has Selina said, when she has<br/>been going to Bristol, `I really cannot get this girl to move from<br/>the house. I absolutely must go in by myself, though I hate being<br/>stuck up in the barouche-landau without a companion; but Augusta, I<br/>believe, with her own good-will, would never stir beyond the park<br/>paling.' Many a time has she said so; and yet I am no advocate for<br/>entire seclusion. I think, on the contrary, when people shut<br/>themselves up entirely from society, it is a very bad thing; and<br/>that it is much more advisable to mix in the world in a proper<br/>degree, without living in it either too much or too little. I<br/>perfectly understand your situation, however, Miss Woodhouse—<br/>(looking towards Mr. Woodhouse), Your father's state of health must<br/>be a great drawback. Why does not he try Bath?—Indeed he should.<br/>Let me recommend Bath to you. I assure you I have no doubt of its<br/>doing Mr. Woodhouse good."<br/><br/>"My father tried it more than once, formerly; but without<br/>receiving any benefit; and Mr. Perry, whose name, I dare say, is<br/>not unknown to you, does not conceive it would be at all more<br/>likely to be useful now."<br/><br/>"Ah! that's a great pity; for I assure you, Miss Woodhouse,<br/>where the waters do agree, it is quite wonderful the relief they<br/>give. In my Bath life, I have seen such instances of it! And it is<br/>so cheerful a place, that it could not fail of being of use to Mr.<br/>Woodhouse's spirits, which, I understand, are sometimes much<br/>depressed. And as to its recommendations to you, I fancy I need not<br/>take much pains to dwell on them. The advantages of Bath to the<br/>young are pretty generally understood. It would be a charming<br/>introduction for you, who have lived so secluded a life; and I<br/>could immediately secure you some of the best society in the place.<br/>A line from me would bring you a little host of acquaintance; and<br/>my particular friend, Mrs. Partridge, the lady I have always<br/>resided with when in Bath, would be most happy to shew you any<br/>attentions, and would be the very person for you to go into public<br/>with."<br/><br/>It was as much as Emma could bear, without being impolite. The<br/>idea of her being indebted to Mrs. Elton for what was called an<br/>introduction—of her going into public under the auspices of a<br/>friend of Mrs. Elton's—probably some vulgar, dashing widow, who,<br/>with the help of a boarder, just made a shift to live!— The dignity<br/>of Miss Woodhouse, of Hartfield, was sunk indeed!<br/><br/>She restrained herself, however, from any of the reproofs she<br/>could have given, and only thanked Mrs. Elton coolly; "but their<br/>going to Bath was quite out of the question; and she was not<br/>perfectly convinced that the place might suit her better than her<br/>father." And then, to prevent farther outrage and indignation,<br/>changed the subject directly.<br/><br/>"I do not ask whether you are musical, Mrs. Elton. Upon these<br/>occasions, a lady's character generally precedes her; and Highbury<br/>has long known that you are a superior performer."<br/><br/>"Oh! no, indeed; I must protest against any such idea. A<br/>superior performer!—very far from it, I assure you. Consider from<br/>how partial a quarter your information came. I am doatingly fond of<br/>music—passionately fond;—and my friends say I am not entirely<br/>devoid of taste; but as to any thing else, upon my honour my<br/>performance is mediocre to the last degree. You, Miss Woodhouse, I<br/>well know, play delightfully. I assure you it has been the greatest<br/>satisfaction, comfort, and delight to me, to hear what a musical<br/>society I am got into. I absolutely cannot do without music. It is<br/>a necessary of life to me; and having always been used to a very<br/>musical society, both at Maple Grove and in Bath, it would have<br/>been a most serious sacrifice. I honestly said as much to Mr. E.<br/>when he was speaking of my future home, and expressing his fears<br/>lest the retirement of it should be disagreeable; and the<br/>inferiority of the house too—knowing what I had been accustomed<br/>to—of course he was not wholly without apprehension. When he was<br/>speaking of it in that way, I honestly said that the world I could<br/>give up—parties, balls, plays—for I had no fear of retirement.<br/>Blessed with so many resources within myself, the world was not<br/>necessary to me. I could do very well without it. To those who had<br/>no resources it was a different thing; but my resources made me<br/>quite independent. And as to smaller-sized rooms than I had been<br/>used to, I really could not give it a thought. I hoped I was<br/>perfectly equal to any sacrifice of that description. Certainly I<br/>had been accustomed to every luxury at Maple Grove; but I did<br/>assure him that two carriages were not necessary to my happiness,<br/>nor were spacious apartments. `But,' said I, `to be quite honest, I<br/>do not think I can live without something of a musical society. I<br/>condition for nothing else; but without music, life would be a<br/>blank to me.'"<br/><br/>"We cannot suppose," said Emma, smiling, "that Mr. Elton would<br/>hesitate to assure you of there being a very musical society in<br/>Highbury; and I hope you will not find he has outstepped the truth<br/>more than may be pardoned, in consideration of the motive."<br/><br/>"No, indeed, I have no doubts at all on that head. I am<br/>delighted to find myself in such a circle. I hope we shall have<br/>many sweet little concerts together. I think, Miss Woodhouse, you<br/>and I must establish a musical club, and have regular weekly<br/>meetings at your house, or ours. Will not it be a good plan? If we<br/>exert ourselves, I think we shall not be long in want of allies.<br/>Something of that nature would be particularly desirable for me, as<br/>an inducement to keep me in practice; for married women, you know—<br/>there is a sad story against them, in general. They are but too apt<br/>to give up music."<br/>
