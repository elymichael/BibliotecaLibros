<br/>"I have heard him lamenting her having no instrument repeatedly;<br/>oftener than I should suppose such a circumstance would, in the<br/>common course of things, occur to him."<br/><br/>"Very well; and if he had intended to give her one, he would<br/>have told her so."<br/><br/>"There might be scruples of delicacy, my dear Emma. I have a<br/>very strong notion that it comes from him. I am sure he was<br/>particularly silent when Mrs. Cole told us of it at dinner."<br/><br/>"You take up an idea, Mrs. Weston, and run away with it; as you<br/>have many a time reproached me with doing. I see no sign of<br/>attachment— I believe nothing of the pianoforte—and proof only<br/>shall convince me that Mr. Knightley has any thought of marrying<br/>Jane Fairfax."<br/><br/>They combated the point some time longer in the same way; Emma<br/>rather gaining ground over the mind of her friend; for Mrs. Weston<br/>was the most used of the two to yield; till a little bustle in the<br/>room shewed them that tea was over, and the instrument in<br/>preparation;— and at the same moment Mr. Cole approaching to<br/>entreat Miss Woodhouse would do them the honour of trying it. Frank<br/>Churchill, of whom, in the eagerness of her conversation with Mrs.<br/>Weston, she had been seeing nothing, except that he had found a<br/>seat by Miss Fairfax, followed Mr. Cole, to add his very pressing<br/>entreaties; and as, in every respect, it suited Emma best to lead,<br/>she gave a very proper compliance.<br/><br/>She knew the limitations of her own powers too well to attempt<br/>more than she could perform with credit; she wanted neither taste<br/>nor spirit in the little things which are generally acceptable, and<br/>could accompany her own voice well. One accompaniment to her song<br/>took her agreeably by surprize—a second, slightly but correctly<br/>taken by Frank Churchill. Her pardon was duly begged at the close<br/>of the song, and every thing usual followed. He was accused of<br/>having a delightful voice, and a perfect knowledge of music; which<br/>was properly denied; and that he knew nothing of the matter, and<br/>had no voice at all, roundly asserted. They sang together once<br/>more; and Emma would then resign her place to Miss Fairfax, whose<br/>performance, both vocal and instrumental, she never could attempt<br/>to conceal from herself, was infinitely superior to her own.<br/><br/>With mixed feelings, she seated herself at a little distance<br/>from the numbers round the instrument, to listen. Frank Churchill<br/>sang again. They had sung together once or twice, it appeared, at<br/>Weymouth. But the sight of Mr. Knightley among the most attentive,<br/>soon drew away half Emma's mind; and she fell into a train of<br/>thinking on the subject of Mrs. Weston's suspicions, to which the<br/>sweet sounds of the united voices gave only momentary<br/>interruptions. Her objections to Mr. Knightley's marrying did not<br/>in the least subside. She could see nothing but evil in it. It<br/>would be a great disappointment to Mr. John Knightley; consequently<br/>to Isabella. A real injury to the children—a most mortifying<br/>change, and material loss to them all;—a very great deduction from<br/>her father's daily comfort—and, as to herself, she could not at all<br/>endure the idea of Jane Fairfax at Donwell Abbey. A Mrs. Knightley<br/>for them all to give way to!—No—Mr. Knightley must never marry.<br/>Little Henry must remain the heir of Donwell.<br/><br/>Presently Mr. Knightley looked back, and came and sat down by<br/>her. They talked at first only of the performance. His admiration<br/>was certainly very warm; yet she thought, but for Mrs. Weston, it<br/>would not have struck her. As a sort of touchstone, however, she<br/>began to speak of his kindness in conveying the aunt and niece; and<br/>though his answer was in the spirit of cutting the matter short,<br/>she believed it to indicate only his disinclination to dwell on any<br/>kindness of his own.<br/><br/>"I often feel concern," said she, "that I dare not make our<br/>carriage more useful on such occasions. It is not that I am without<br/>the wish; but you know how impossible my father would deem it that<br/>James should put-to for such a purpose."<br/><br/>"Quite out of the question, quite out of the question," he<br/>replied;— "but you must often wish it, I am sure." And he smiled<br/>with such seeming pleasure at the conviction, that she must proceed<br/>another step.<br/><br/>
