<br/>"Well, I cannot understand it."<br/><br/>"That is the case with us all, papa. One half of the world<br/>cannot understand the pleasures of the other."<br/><br/>Later in the morning, and just as the girls were going to<br/>separate in preparation for the regular four o'clock dinner, the<br/>hero of this inimitable charade walked in again. Harriet turned<br/>away; but Emma could receive him with the usual smile, and her<br/>quick eye soon discerned in his the consciousness of having made a<br/>push—of having thrown a die; and she imagined he was come to see<br/>how it might turn up. His ostensible reason, however, was to ask<br/>whether Mr. Woodhouse's party could be made up in the evening<br/>without him, or whether he should be in the smallest degree<br/>necessary at Hartfield. If he were, every thing else must give way;<br/>but otherwise his friend Cole had been saying so much about his<br/>dining with him—had made such a point of it, that he had promised<br/>him conditionally to come.<br/><br/>Emma thanked him, but could not allow of his disappointing his<br/>friend on their account; her father was sure of his rubber. He<br/>re-urged—she re-declined; and he seemed then about to make his bow,<br/>when taking the paper from the table, she returned it—<br/><br/>"Oh! here is the charade you were so obliging as to leave with<br/>us; thank you for the sight of it. We admired it so much, that I<br/>have ventured to write it into Miss Smith's collection. Your friend<br/>will not take it amiss I hope. Of course I have not transcribed<br/>beyond the first eight lines."<br/><br/>Mr. Elton certainly did not very well know what to say. He<br/>looked rather doubtingly—rather confused; said something about<br/>"honour,"—glanced at Emma and at Harriet, and then seeing the book<br/>open on the table, took it up, and examined it very attentively.<br/>With the view of passing off an awkward moment, Emma smilingly<br/>said,<br/><br/>"You must make my apologies to your friend; but so good a<br/>charade must not be confined to one or two. He may be sure of every<br/>woman's approbation while he writes with such gallantry."<br/><br/>"I have no hesitation in saying," replied Mr. Elton, though<br/>hesitating a good deal while he spoke; "I have no hesitation in<br/>saying—at least if my friend feels at all as I do—I have not the<br/>smallest doubt that, could he see his little effusion honoured as I<br/>see it, (looking at the book again, and replacing it on the table),<br/>he would consider it as the proudest moment of his life."<br/><br/>After this speech he was gone as soon as possible. Emma could<br/>not think it too soon; for with all his good and agreeable<br/>qualities, there was a sort of parade in his speeches which was<br/>very apt to incline her to laugh. She ran away to indulge the<br/>inclination, leaving the tender and the sublime of pleasure to<br/>Harriet's share.<br/><br/><br/><br/>
