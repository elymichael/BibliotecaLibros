"Yes," he replied, "any body may know how highly I think of<br/>her."<br/><br/>"And yet," said Emma, beginning hastily and with an arch look,<br/>but soon stopping—it was better, however, to know the worst at<br/>once— she hurried on—"And yet, perhaps, you may hardly be aware<br/>yourself how highly it is. The extent of your admiration may take<br/>you by surprize some day or other."<br/><br/>Mr. Knightley was hard at work upon the lower buttons of his<br/>thick leather gaiters, and either the exertion of getting them<br/>together, or some other cause, brought the colour into his face, as<br/>he answered,<br/><br/>"Oh! are you there?—But you are miserably behindhand. Mr. Cole<br/>gave me a hint of it six weeks ago."<br/><br/>He stopped.—Emma felt her foot pressed by Mrs. Weston, and did<br/>not herself know what to think. In a moment he went on—<br/><br/>"That will never be, however, I can assure you. Miss Fairfax, I<br/>dare say, would not have me if I were to ask her—and I am very sure<br/>I shall never ask her."<br/><br/>Emma returned her friend's pressure with interest; and was<br/>pleased enough to exclaim,<br/><br/>"You are not vain, Mr. Knightley. I will say that for you."<br/><br/>He seemed hardly to hear her; he was thoughtful—and in a manner<br/>which shewed him not pleased, soon afterwards said,<br/><br/>"So you have been settling that I should marry Jane<br/>Fairfax?"<br/><br/>"No indeed I have not. You have scolded me too much for<br/>match-making, for me to presume to take such a liberty with you.<br/>What I said just now, meant nothing. One says those sort of things,<br/>of course, without any idea of a serious meaning. Oh! no, upon my<br/>word I have not the smallest wish for your marrying Jane Fairfax or<br/>Jane any body. You would not come in and sit with us in this<br/>comfortable way, if you were married."<br/>
