"Is not this most vexations, Knightley?" she cried.—"And such<br/>weather for exploring!—These delays and disappointments are quite<br/>odious. What are we to do?—The year will wear away at this rate,<br/>and nothing done. Before this time last year I assure you we had<br/>had a delightful exploring party from Maple Grove to Kings<br/>Weston."<br/><br/>"You had better explore to Donwell," replied Mr. Knightley.<br/>"That may be done without horses. Come, and eat my strawberries.<br/>They are ripening fast."<br/><br/>If Mr. Knightley did not begin seriously, he was obliged to<br/>proceed so, for his proposal was caught at with delight; and the<br/>"Oh! I should like it of all things," was not plainer in words than<br/>manner. Donwell was famous for its strawberry-beds, which seemed a<br/>plea for the invitation: but no plea was necessary; cabbage-beds<br/>would have been enough to tempt the lady, who only wanted to be<br/>going somewhere. She promised him again and again to come—much<br/>oftener than he doubted—and was extremely gratified by such a proof<br/>of intimacy, such a distinguishing compliment as she chose to<br/>consider it.<br/><br/>"You may depend upon me," said she. "I certainly will come. Name<br/>your day, and I will come. You will allow me to bring Jane<br/>Fairfax?"<br/><br/>"I cannot name a day," said he, "till I have spoken to some<br/>others whom I would wish to meet you."<br/><br/>"Oh! leave all that to me. Only give me a carte-blanche.—I am<br/>Lady Patroness, you know. It is my party. I will bring friends with<br/>me."<br/><br/>"I hope you will bring Elton," said he: "but I will not trouble<br/>you to give any other invitations."<br/><br/>"Oh! now you are looking very sly. But consider—you need not be<br/>afraid of delegating power to me. I am no young lady on her<br/>preferment. Married women, you know, may be safely authorised. It<br/>is my party. Leave it all to me. I will invite your guests."<br/><br/>"No,"—he calmly replied,—"there is but one married woman in the<br/>world whom I can ever allow to invite what guests she pleases to<br/>Donwell, and that one is—"<br/><br/>"—Mrs. Weston, I suppose," interrupted Mrs. Elton, rather<br/>mortified.<br/><br/>"No—Mrs. Knightley;—and till she is in being, I will manage such<br/>matters myself."<br/>
