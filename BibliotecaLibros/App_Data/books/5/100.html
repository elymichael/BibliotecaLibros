<br/>"Thank you. You are very kind. Yes, next week. Every body is so<br/>surprized; and every body says the same obliging things. I am sure<br/>she will be as happy to see her friends at Highbury, as they can be<br/>to see her. Yes, Friday or Saturday; she cannot say which, because<br/>Colonel Campbell will be wanting the carriage himself one of those<br/>days. So very good of them to send her the whole way! But they<br/>always do, you know. Oh yes, Friday or Saturday next. That is what<br/>she writes about. That is the reason of her writing out of rule, as<br/>we call it; for, in the common course, we should not have heard<br/>from her before next Tuesday or Wednesday."<br/><br/>"Yes, so I imagined. I was afraid there could be little chance<br/>of my hearing any thing of Miss Fairfax to-day."<br/><br/>"So obliging of you! No, we should not have heard, if it had not<br/>been for this particular circumstance, of her being to come here so<br/>soon. My mother is so delighted!—for she is to be three months with<br/>us at least. Three months, she says so, positively, as I am going<br/>to have the pleasure of reading to you. The case is, you see, that<br/>the Campbells are going to Ireland. Mrs. Dixon has persuaded her<br/>father and mother to come over and see her directly. They had not<br/>intended to go over till the summer, but she is so impatient to see<br/>them again—for till she married, last October, she was never away<br/>from them so much as a week, which must make it very strange to be<br/>in different kingdoms, I was going to say, but however different<br/>countries, and so she wrote a very urgent letter to her mother—or<br/>her father, I declare I do not know which it was, but we shall see<br/>presently in Jane's letter—wrote in Mr. Dixon's name as well as her<br/>own, to press their coming over directly, and they would give them<br/>the meeting in Dublin, and take them back to their country seat,<br/>Baly-craig, a beautiful place, I fancy. Jane has heard a great deal<br/>of its beauty; from Mr. Dixon, I mean— I do not know that she ever<br/>heard about it from any body else; but it was very natural, you<br/>know, that he should like to speak of his own place while he was<br/>paying his addresses—and as Jane used to be very often walking out<br/>with them—for Colonel and Mrs. Campbell were very particular about<br/>their daughter's not walking out often with only Mr. Dixon, for<br/>which I do not at all blame them; of course she heard every thing<br/>he might be telling Miss Campbell about his own home in Ireland;<br/>and I think she wrote us word that he had shewn them some drawings<br/>of the place, views that he had taken himself. He is a most<br/>amiable, charming young man, I believe. Jane was quite longing to<br/>go to Ireland, from his account of things."<br/><br/>At this moment, an ingenious and animating suspicion entering<br/>Emma's brain with regard to Jane Fairfax, this charming Mr. Dixon,<br/>and the not going to Ireland, she said, with the insidious design<br/>of farther discovery,<br/><br/>"You must feel it very fortunate that Miss Fairfax should be<br/>allowed to come to you at such a time. Considering the very<br/>particular friendship between her and Mrs. Dixon, you could hardly<br/>have expected her to be excused from accompanying Colonel and Mrs.<br/>Campbell."<br/><br/>"Very true, very true, indeed. The very thing that we have<br/>always been rather afraid of; for we should not have liked to have<br/>her at such a distance from us, for months together—not able to<br/>come if any thing was to happen. But you see, every thing turns out<br/>for the best. They want her (Mr. and Mrs. Dixon) excessively to<br/>come over with Colonel and Mrs. Campbell; quite depend upon it;<br/>nothing can be more kind or pressing than their joint invitation,<br/>Jane says, as you will hear presently; Mr. Dixon does not seem in<br/>the least backward in any attention. He is a most charming young<br/>man. Ever since the service he rendered Jane at Weymouth, when they<br/>were out in that party on the water, and she, by the sudden<br/>whirling round of something or other among the sails, would have<br/>been dashed into the sea at once, and actually was all but gone, if<br/>he had not, with the greatest presence of mind, caught hold of her<br/>habit— (I can never think of it without trembling!)—But ever since<br/>we had the history of that day, I have been so fond of Mr.<br/>Dixon!"<br/><br/>"But, in spite of all her friends' urgency, and her own wish of<br/>seeing Ireland, Miss Fairfax prefers devoting the time to you and<br/>Mrs. Bates?"<br/><br/>"Yes—entirely her own doing, entirely her own choice; and<br/>Colonel and Mrs. Campbell think she does quite right, just what<br/>they should recommend; and indeed they particularly wish her to try<br/>her native air, as she has not been quite so well as usual<br/>lately."<br/><br/>"I am concerned to hear of it. I think they judge wisely. But<br/>Mrs. Dixon must be very much disappointed. Mrs. Dixon, I<br/>understand, has no remarkable degree of personal beauty; is not, by<br/>any means, to be compared with Miss Fairfax."<br/><br/>"Oh! no. You are very obliging to say such things—but certainly<br/>not. There is no comparison between them. Miss Campbell always was<br/>absolutely plain—but extremely elegant and amiable."<br/><br/>
