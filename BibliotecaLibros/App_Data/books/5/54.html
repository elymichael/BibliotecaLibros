Mr. Woodhouse could never allow for Mr. Knightley's claims on<br/>his brother, or any body's claims on Isabella, except his own. He<br/>sat musing a little while, and then said,<br/><br/>"But I do not see why poor Isabella should be obliged to go back<br/>so soon, though he does. I think, Emma, I shall try and persuade<br/>her to stay longer with us. She and the children might stay very<br/>well."<br/><br/>"Ah! papa—that is what you never have been able to accomplish,<br/>and I do not think you ever will. Isabella cannot bear to stay<br/>behind her husband."<br/><br/>This was too true for contradiction. Unwelcome as it was, Mr.<br/>Woodhouse could only give a submissive sigh; and as Emma saw his<br/>spirits affected by the idea of his daughter's attachment to her<br/>husband, she immediately led to such a branch of the subject as<br/>must raise them.<br/><br/>"Harriet must give us as much of her company as she can while my<br/>brother and sister are here. I am sure she will be pleased with the<br/>children. We are very proud of the children, are not we, papa? I<br/>wonder which she will think the handsomest, Henry or John?"<br/><br/>"Aye, I wonder which she will. Poor little dears, how glad they<br/>will be to come. They are very fond of being at Hartfield,<br/>Harriet."<br/><br/>"I dare say they are, sir. I am sure I do not know who is<br/>not."<br/><br/>"Henry is a fine boy, but John is very like his mama. Henry is<br/>the eldest, he was named after me, not after his father. John, the<br/>second, is named after his father. Some people are surprized, I<br/>believe, that the eldest was not, but Isabella would have him<br/>called Henry, which I thought very pretty of her. And he is a very<br/>clever boy, indeed. They are all remarkably clever; and they have<br/>so many pretty ways. They will come and stand by my chair, and say,<br/>`Grandpapa, can you give me a bit of string?' and once Henry asked<br/>me for a knife, but I told him knives were only made for<br/>grandpapas. I think their father is too rough with them very<br/>often."<br/><br/>"He appears rough to you," said Emma, "because you are so very<br/>gentle yourself; but if you could compare him with other papas, you<br/>would not think him rough. He wishes his boys to be active and<br/>hardy; and if they misbehave, can give them a sharp word now and<br/>then; but he is an affectionate father—certainly Mr. John Knightley<br/>is an affectionate father. The children are all fond of him."<br/><br/>"And then their uncle comes in, and tosses them up to the<br/>ceiling in a very frightful way!"<br/><br/>"But they like it, papa; there is nothing they like so much. It<br/>is such enjoyment to them, that if their uncle did not lay down the<br/>rule of their taking turns, whichever began would never give way to<br/>the other."<br/>
