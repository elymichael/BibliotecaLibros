"I was with Mr. Cole on business an hour and a half ago. He had<br/>just read Elton's letter as I was shewn in, and handed it to me<br/>directly."<br/><br/>"Well! that is quite—I suppose there never was a piece of news<br/>more generally interesting. My dear sir, you really are too<br/>bountiful. My mother desires her very best compliments and regards,<br/>and a thousand thanks, and says you really quite oppress her."<br/><br/>"We consider our Hartfield pork," replied Mr. Woodhouse—"indeed<br/>it certainly is, so very superior to all other pork, that Emma and<br/>I cannot have a greater pleasure than—"<br/><br/>"Oh! my dear sir, as my mother says, our friends are only too<br/>good to us. If ever there were people who, without having great<br/>wealth themselves, had every thing they could wish for, I am sure<br/>it is us. We may well say that `our lot is cast in a goodly<br/>heritage.' Well, Mr. Knightley, and so you actually saw the letter;<br/>well—"<br/><br/>"It was short—merely to announce—but cheerful, exulting, of<br/>course."— Here was a sly glance at Emma. "He had been so fortunate<br/>as to— I forget the precise words—one has no business to remember<br/>them. The information was, as you state, that he was going to be<br/>married to a Miss Hawkins. By his style, I should imagine it just<br/>settled."<br/><br/>"Mr. Elton going to be married!" said Emma, as soon as she could<br/>speak. "He will have every body's wishes for his happiness."<br/><br/>"He is very young to settle," was Mr. Woodhouse's observation.<br/>"He had better not be in a hurry. He seemed to me very well off as<br/>he was. We were always glad to see him at Hartfield."<br/><br/>"A new neighbour for us all, Miss Woodhouse!" said Miss Bates,<br/>joyfully; "my mother is so pleased!—she says she cannot bear to<br/>have the poor old Vicarage without a mistress. This is great news,<br/>indeed. Jane, you have never seen Mr. Elton!—no wonder that you<br/>have such a curiosity to see him."<br/><br/>Jane's curiosity did not appear of that absorbing nature as<br/>wholly to occupy her.<br/><br/>"No—I have never seen Mr. Elton," she replied, starting on this<br/>appeal; "is he—is he a tall man?"<br/><br/>"Who shall answer that question?" cried Emma. "My father would<br/>say `yes,' Mr. Knightley `no;' and Miss Bates and I that he is just<br/>the happy medium. When you have been here a little longer, Miss<br/>Fairfax, you will understand that Mr. Elton is the standard of<br/>perfection in Highbury, both in person and mind."<br/>
