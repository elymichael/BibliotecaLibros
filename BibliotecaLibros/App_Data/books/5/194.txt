"Upon my word," exclaimed Emma, "you amuse me! I should like to
know how many of all my numerous engagements take place without
your being of the party; and why I am to be supposed in danger of
wanting leisure to attend to the little boys. These amazing
engagements of mine— what have they been? Dining once with the
Coles—and having a ball talked of, which never took place. I can
understand you—(nodding at Mr. John Knightley)—your good fortune in
meeting with so many of your friends at once here, delights you too
much to pass unnoticed. But you, (turning to Mr. Knightley,) who
know how very, very seldom I am ever two hours from Hartfield, why
you should foresee such a series of dissipation for me, I cannot
imagine. And as to my dear little boys, I must say, that if Aunt
Emma has not time for them, I do not think they would fare much
better with Uncle Knightley, who is absent from home about five
hours where she is absent one— and who, when he is at home, is
either reading to himself or settling his accounts."

Mr. Knightley seemed to be trying not to smile; and succeeded
without difficulty, upon Mrs. Elton's beginning to talk to him.
