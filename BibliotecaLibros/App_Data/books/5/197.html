Emma heard that Frank wrote in the highest spirits of this<br/>arrangement, and seemed most fully to appreciate the blessing of<br/>having two months before him of such near neighbourhood to many<br/>dear friends— for the house was taken for May and June. She was<br/>told that now he wrote with the greatest confidence of being often<br/>with them, almost as often as he could even wish.<br/><br/>Emma saw how Mr. Weston understood these joyous prospects. He<br/>was considering her as the source of all the happiness they<br/>offered. She hoped it was not so. Two months must bring it to the<br/>proof.<br/><br/>Mr. Weston's own happiness was indisputable. He was quite<br/>delighted. It was the very circumstance he could have wished for.<br/>Now, it would be really having Frank in their neighbourhood. What<br/>were nine miles to a young man?—An hour's ride. He would be always<br/>coming over. The difference in that respect of Richmond and London<br/>was enough to make the whole difference of seeing him always and<br/>seeing him never. Sixteen miles—nay, eighteen—it must be full<br/>eighteen to Manchester-street—was a serious obstacle. Were he ever<br/>able to get away, the day would be spent in coming and returning.<br/>There was no comfort in having him in London; he might as well be<br/>at Enscombe; but Richmond was the very distance for easy<br/>intercourse. Better than nearer!<br/><br/>One good thing was immediately brought to a certainty by this<br/>removal,— the ball at the Crown. It had not been forgotten before,<br/>but it had been soon acknowledged vain to attempt to fix a day.<br/>Now, however, it was absolutely to be; every preparation was<br/>resumed, and very soon after the Churchills had removed to<br/>Richmond, a few lines from Frank, to say that his aunt felt already<br/>much better for the change, and that he had no doubt of being able<br/>to join them for twenty-four hours at any given time, induced them<br/>to name as early a day as possible.<br/><br/>Mr. Weston's ball was to be a real thing. A very few to-morrows<br/>stood between the young people of Highbury and happiness.<br/><br/>Mr. Woodhouse was resigned. The time of year lightened the evil<br/>to him. May was better for every thing than February. Mrs. Bates<br/>was engaged to spend the evening at Hartfield, James had due<br/>notice, and he sanguinely hoped that neither dear little Henry nor<br/>dear little John would have any thing the matter with them, while<br/>dear Emma were gone.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
