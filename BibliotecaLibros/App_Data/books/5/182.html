<br/>Jane looked as if she did not mean to be conquered; but instead<br/>of answering, she began speaking again to Mr. John Knightley.<br/><br/>"The post-office is a wonderful establishment!" said she.— "The<br/>regularity and despatch of it! If one thinks of all that it has to<br/>do, and all that it does so well, it is really astonishing!"<br/><br/>"It is certainly very well regulated."<br/><br/>"So seldom that any negligence or blunder appears! So seldom<br/>that a letter, among the thousands that are constantly passing<br/>about the kingdom, is even carried wrong—and not one in a million,<br/>I suppose, actually lost! And when one considers the variety of<br/>hands, and of bad hands too, that are to be deciphered, it<br/>increases the wonder."<br/><br/>"The clerks grow expert from habit.—They must begin with some<br/>quickness of sight and hand, and exercise improves them. If you<br/>want any farther explanation," continued he, smiling, "they are<br/>paid for it. That is the key to a great deal of capacity. The<br/>public pays and must be served well."<br/><br/>The varieties of handwriting were farther talked of, and the<br/>usual observations made.<br/><br/>"I have heard it asserted," said John Knightley, "that the same<br/>sort of handwriting often prevails in a family; and where the same<br/>master teaches, it is natural enough. But for that reason, I should<br/>imagine the likeness must be chiefly confined to the females, for<br/>boys have very little teaching after an early age, and scramble<br/>into any hand they can get. Isabella and Emma, I think, do write<br/>very much alike. I have not always known their writing apart."<br/><br/>"Yes," said his brother hesitatingly, "there is a likeness. I<br/>know what you mean—but Emma's hand is the strongest."<br/><br/>"Isabella and Emma both write beautifully," said Mr. Woodhouse;<br/>"and always did. And so does poor Mrs. Weston"—with half a sigh and<br/>half a smile at her.<br/><br/>"I never saw any gentleman's handwriting"—Emma began, looking<br/>also at Mrs. Weston; but stopped, on perceiving that Mrs. Weston<br/>was attending to some one else—and the pause gave her time to<br/>reflect, "Now, how am I going to introduce him?—Am I unequal to<br/>speaking his name at once before all these people? Is it necessary<br/>for me to use any roundabout phrase?—Your Yorkshire friend— your<br/>correspondent in Yorkshire;—that would be the way, I suppose, if I<br/>were very bad.—No, I can pronounce his name without the smallest<br/>distress. I certainly get better and better.—Now for it."<br/><br/>
