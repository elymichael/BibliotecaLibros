She spoke with great agitation; and Emma very feelingly replied,<br/>"That can be no reason for your being exposed to danger now. I must<br/>order the carriage. The heat even would be danger.—You are fatigued<br/>already."<br/><br/>"I am,"—she answered—"I am fatigued; but it is not the sort of<br/>fatigue—quick walking will refresh me.—Miss Woodhouse, we all know<br/>at times what it is to be wearied in spirits. Mine, I confess, are<br/>exhausted. The greatest kindness you can shew me, will be to let me<br/>have my own way, and only say that I am gone when it is<br/>necessary."<br/><br/>Emma had not another word to oppose. She saw it all; and<br/>entering into her feelings, promoted her quitting the house<br/>immediately, and watched her safely off with the zeal of a friend.<br/>Her parting look was grateful—and her parting words, "Oh! Miss<br/>Woodhouse, the comfort of being sometimes alone!"—seemed to burst<br/>from an overcharged heart, and to describe somewhat of the<br/>continual endurance to be practised by her, even towards some of<br/>those who loved her best.<br/><br/>"Such a home, indeed! such an aunt!" said Emma, as she turned<br/>back into the hall again. "I do pity you. And the more sensibility<br/>you betray of their just horrors, the more I shall like you."<br/><br/>Jane had not been gone a quarter of an hour, and they had only<br/>accomplished some views of St. Mark's Place, Venice, when Frank<br/>Churchill entered the room. Emma had not been thinking of him, she<br/>had forgotten to think of him—but she was very glad to see him.<br/>Mrs. Weston would be at ease. The black mare was blameless; they<br/>were right who had named Mrs. Churchill as the cause. He had been<br/>detained by a temporary increase of illness in her; a nervous<br/>seizure, which had lasted some hours—and he had quite given up<br/>every thought of coming, till very late;—and had he known how hot a<br/>ride he should have, and how late, with all his hurry, he must be,<br/>he believed he should not have come at all. The heat was excessive;<br/>he had never suffered any thing like it—almost wished he had staid<br/>at home—nothing killed him like heat—he could bear any degree of<br/>cold, etc., but heat was intolerable—and he sat down, at the<br/>greatest possible distance from the slight remains of Mr.<br/>Woodhouse's fire, looking very deplorable.<br/><br/>"You will soon be cooler, if you sit still," said Emma.<br/><br/>"As soon as I am cooler I shall go back again. I could very ill<br/>be spared—but such a point had been made of my coming! You will all<br/>be going soon I suppose; the whole party breaking up. I met one as<br/>I came—Madness in such weather!—absolute madness!"<br/><br/>Emma listened, and looked, and soon perceived that Frank<br/>Churchill's state might be best defined by the expressive phrase of<br/>being out of humour. Some people were always cross when they were<br/>hot. Such might be his constitution; and as she knew that eating<br/>and drinking were often the cure of such incidental complaints, she<br/>recommended his taking some refreshment; he would find abundance of<br/>every thing in the dining-room—and she humanely pointed out the<br/>door.<br/><br/>"No—he should not eat. He was not hungry; it would only make him<br/>hotter." In two minutes, however, he relented in his own favour;<br/>and muttering something about spruce-beer, walked off. Emma<br/>returned all her attention to her father, saying in secret—<br/><br/>"I am glad I have done being in love with him. I should not like<br/>a man who is so soon discomposed by a hot morning. Harriet's sweet<br/>easy temper will not mind it."<br/><br/>He was gone long enough to have had a very comfortable meal, and<br/>came back all the better—grown quite cool—and, with good manners,<br/>like himself—able to draw a chair close to them, take an interest<br/>in their employment; and regret, in a reasonable way, that he<br/>should be so late. He was not in his best spirits, but seemed<br/>trying to improve them; and, at last, made himself talk nonsense<br/>very agreeably. They were looking over views in Swisserland.<br/>
