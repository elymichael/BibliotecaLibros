She saw that Enscombe could not satisfy, and that Highbury,<br/>taken at its best, might reasonably please a young man who had more<br/>retirement at home than he liked. His importance at Enscombe was<br/>very evident. He did not boast, but it naturally betrayed itself,<br/>that he had persuaded his aunt where his uncle could do nothing,<br/>and on her laughing and noticing it, he owned that he believed<br/>(excepting one or two points) he could with time persuade her to<br/>any thing. One of those points on which his influence failed, he<br/>then mentioned. He had wanted very much to go abroad—had been very<br/>eager indeed to be allowed to travel—but she would not hear of it.<br/>This had happened the year before. Now, he said, he was beginning<br/>to have no longer the same wish.<br/><br/>The unpersuadable point, which he did not mention, Emma guessed<br/>to be good behaviour to his father.<br/><br/>"I have made a most wretched discovery," said he, after a short<br/>pause.— "I have been here a week to-morrow—half my time. I never<br/>knew days fly so fast. A week to-morrow!—And I have hardly begun to<br/>enjoy myself. But just got acquainted with Mrs. Weston, and<br/>others!— I hate the recollection."<br/><br/>"Perhaps you may now begin to regret that you spent one whole<br/>day, out of so few, in having your hair cut."<br/><br/>"No," said he, smiling, "that is no subject of regret at all. I<br/>have no pleasure in seeing my friends, unless I can believe myself<br/>fit to be seen."<br/><br/>The rest of the gentlemen being now in the room, Emma found<br/>herself obliged to turn from him for a few minutes, and listen to<br/>Mr. Cole. When Mr. Cole had moved away, and her attention could be<br/>restored as before, she saw Frank Churchill looking intently across<br/>the room at Miss Fairfax, who was sitting exactly opposite.<br/><br/>"What is the matter?" said she.<br/><br/>He started. "Thank you for rousing me," he replied. "I believe I<br/>have been very rude; but really Miss Fairfax has done her hair in<br/>so odd a way—so very odd a way—that I cannot keep my eyes from her.<br/>I never saw any thing so outree!—Those curls!—This must be a fancy<br/>of her own. I see nobody else looking like her!— I must go and ask<br/>her whether it is an Irish fashion. Shall I?— Yes, I will—I declare<br/>I will—and you shall see how she takes it;— whether she<br/>colours."<br/><br/>He was gone immediately; and Emma soon saw him standing before<br/>Miss Fairfax, and talking to her; but as to its effect on the young<br/>lady, as he had improvidently placed himself exactly between them,<br/>exactly in front of Miss Fairfax, she could absolutely distinguish<br/>nothing.<br/><br/>Before he could return to his chair, it was taken by Mrs.<br/>Weston.<br/><br/>"This is the luxury of a large party," said she:—"one can get<br/>near every body, and say every thing. My dear Emma, I am longing to<br/>talk to you. I have been making discoveries and forming plans, just<br/>like yourself, and I must tell them while the idea is fresh. Do you<br/>know how Miss Bates and her niece came here?"<br/>
