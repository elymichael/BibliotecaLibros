"So do I," said Mrs. Weston gently, "very much."<br/><br/>"She always declares she will never marry, which, of course,<br/>means just nothing at all. But I have no idea that she has yet ever<br/>seen a man she cared for. It would not be a bad thing for her to be<br/>very much in love with a proper object. I should like to see Emma<br/>in love, and in some doubt of a return; it would do her good. But<br/>there is nobody hereabouts to attach her; and she goes so seldom<br/>from home."<br/><br/>"There does, indeed, seem as little to tempt her to break her<br/>resolution at present," said Mrs. Weston, "as can well be; and<br/>while she is so happy at Hartfield, I cannot wish her to be forming<br/>any attachment which would be creating such difficulties on poor<br/>Mr. Woodhouse's account. I do not recommend matrimony at present to<br/>Emma, though I mean no slight to the state, I assure you."<br/><br/>Part of her meaning was to conceal some favourite thoughts of<br/>her own and Mr. Weston's on the subject, as much as possible. There<br/>were wishes at Randalls respecting Emma's destiny, but it was not<br/>desirable to have them suspected; and the quiet transition which<br/>Mr. Knightley soon afterwards made to "What does Weston think of<br/>the weather; shall we have rain?" convinced her that he had nothing<br/>more to say or surmise about Hartfield.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
