<br/>"You, sir, may say any thing," cried Mr. Elton, "but I must<br/>confess that I regard it as a most happy thought, the placing of<br/>Miss Smith out of doors; and the tree is touched with such<br/>inimitable spirit! Any other situation would have been much less in<br/>character. The naivete of Miss Smith's manners—and altogether—Oh,<br/>it is most admirable! I cannot keep my eyes from it. I never saw<br/>such a likeness."<br/><br/>The next thing wanted was to get the picture framed; and here<br/>were a few difficulties. It must be done directly; it must be done<br/>in London; the order must go through the hands of some intelligent<br/>person whose taste could be depended on; and Isabella, the usual<br/>doer of all commissions, must not be applied to, because it was<br/>December, and Mr. Woodhouse could not bear the idea of her stirring<br/>out of her house in the fogs of December. But no sooner was the<br/>distress known to Mr. Elton, than it was removed. His gallantry was<br/>always on the alert. "Might he be trusted with the commission, what<br/>infinite pleasure should he have in executing it! he could ride to<br/>London at any time. It was impossible to say how much he should be<br/>gratified by being employed on such an errand."<br/><br/>"He was too good!—she could not endure the thought!—she would<br/>not give him such a troublesome office for the world,"—brought on<br/>the desired repetition of entreaties and assurances,—and a very few<br/>minutes settled the business.<br/><br/>Mr. Elton was to take the drawing to London, chuse the frame,<br/>and give the directions; and Emma thought she could so pack it as<br/>to ensure its safety without much incommoding him, while he seemed<br/>mostly fearful of not being incommoded enough.<br/><br/>"What a precious deposit!" said he with a tender sigh, as he<br/>received it.<br/><br/>"This man is almost too gallant to be in love," thought Emma. "I<br/>should say so, but that I suppose there may be a hundred different<br/>ways of being in love. He is an excellent young man, and will suit<br/>Harriet exactly; it will be an `Exactly so,' as he says himself;<br/>but he does sigh and languish, and study for compliments rather<br/>more than I could endure as a principal. I come in for a pretty<br/>good share as a second. But it is his gratitude on Harriet's<br/>account."<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
