Oh! had she never brought Harriet forward! Had she left her<br/>where she ought, and where he had told her she ought!—Had she not,<br/>with a folly which no tongue could express, prevented her marrying<br/>the unexceptionable young man who would have made her happy and<br/>respectable in the line of life to which she ought to belong— all<br/>would have been safe; none of this dreadful sequel would have<br/>been.<br/><br/>How Harriet could ever have had the presumption to raise her<br/>thoughts to Mr. Knightley!—How she could dare to fancy herself the<br/>chosen of such a man till actually assured of it!— But Harriet was<br/>less humble, had fewer scruples than formerly.— Her inferiority,<br/>whether of mind or situation, seemed little felt.— She had seemed<br/>more sensible of Mr. Elton's being to stoop in marrying her, than<br/>she now seemed of Mr. Knightley's.— Alas! was not that her own<br/>doing too? Who had been at pains to give Harriet notions of<br/>self-consequence but herself?—Who but herself had taught her, that<br/>she was to elevate herself if possible, and that her claims were<br/>great to a high worldly establishment?— If Harriet, from being<br/>humble, were grown vain, it was her doing too.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
