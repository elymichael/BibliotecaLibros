"I was with Mr. Cole on business an hour and a half ago. He had
just read Elton's letter as I was shewn in, and handed it to me
directly."

"Well! that is quite—I suppose there never was a piece of news
more generally interesting. My dear sir, you really are too
bountiful. My mother desires her very best compliments and regards,
and a thousand thanks, and says you really quite oppress her."

"We consider our Hartfield pork," replied Mr. Woodhouse—"indeed
it certainly is, so very superior to all other pork, that Emma and
I cannot have a greater pleasure than—"

"Oh! my dear sir, as my mother says, our friends are only too
good to us. If ever there were people who, without having great
wealth themselves, had every thing they could wish for, I am sure
it is us. We may well say that `our lot is cast in a goodly
heritage.' Well, Mr. Knightley, and so you actually saw the letter;
well—"

"It was short—merely to announce—but cheerful, exulting, of
course."— Here was a sly glance at Emma. "He had been so fortunate
as to— I forget the precise words—one has no business to remember
them. The information was, as you state, that he was going to be
married to a Miss Hawkins. By his style, I should imagine it just
settled."

"Mr. Elton going to be married!" said Emma, as soon as she could
speak. "He will have every body's wishes for his happiness."

"He is very young to settle," was Mr. Woodhouse's observation.
"He had better not be in a hurry. He seemed to me very well off as
he was. We were always glad to see him at Hartfield."

"A new neighbour for us all, Miss Woodhouse!" said Miss Bates,
joyfully; "my mother is so pleased!—she says she cannot bear to
have the poor old Vicarage without a mistress. This is great news,
indeed. Jane, you have never seen Mr. Elton!—no wonder that you
have such a curiosity to see him."

Jane's curiosity did not appear of that absorbing nature as
wholly to occupy her.

"No—I have never seen Mr. Elton," she replied, starting on this
appeal; "is he—is he a tall man?"

"Who shall answer that question?" cried Emma. "My father would
say `yes,' Mr. Knightley `no;' and Miss Bates and I that he is just
the happy medium. When you have been here a little longer, Miss
Fairfax, you will understand that Mr. Elton is the standard of
perfection in Highbury, both in person and mind."
