How was she to bear the change?—It was true that her friend was<br/>going only half a mile from them; but Emma was aware that great<br/>must be the difference between a Mrs. Weston, only half a mile from<br/>them, and a Miss Taylor in the house; and with all her advantages,<br/>natural and domestic, she was now in great danger of suffering from<br/>intellectual solitude. She dearly loved her father, but he was no<br/>companion for her. He could not meet her in conversation, rational<br/>or playful.<br/><br/>The evil of the actual disparity in their ages (and Mr.<br/>Woodhouse had not married early) was much increased by his<br/>constitution and habits; for having been a valetudinarian all his<br/>life, without activity of mind or body, he was a much older man in<br/>ways than in years; and though everywhere beloved for the<br/>friendliness of his heart and his amiable temper, his talents could<br/>not have recommended him at any time.<br/><br/>Her sister, though comparatively but little removed by<br/>matrimony, being settled in London, only sixteen miles off, was<br/>much beyond her daily reach; and many a long October and November<br/>evening must be struggled through at Hartfield, before Christmas<br/>brought the next visit from Isabella and her husband, and their<br/>little children, to fill the house, and give her pleasant society<br/>again.<br/><br/>Highbury, the large and populous village, almost amounting to a<br/>town, to which Hartfield, in spite of its separate lawn, and<br/>shrubberies, and name, did really belong, afforded her no equals.<br/>The Woodhouses were first in consequence there. All looked up to<br/>them. She had many acquaintance in the place, for her father was<br/>universally civil, but not one among them who could be accepted in<br/>lieu of Miss Taylor for even half a day. It was a melancholy<br/>change; and Emma could not but sigh over it, and wish for<br/>impossible things, till her father awoke, and made it necessary to<br/>be cheerful. His spirits required support. He was a nervous man,<br/>easily depressed; fond of every body that he was used to, and<br/>hating to part with them; hating change of every kind. Matrimony,<br/>as the origin of change, was always disagreeable; and he was by no<br/>means yet reconciled to his own daughter's marrying, nor could ever<br/>speak of her but with compassion, though it had been entirely a<br/>match of affection, when he was now obliged to part with Miss<br/>Taylor too; and from his habits of gentle selfishness, and of being<br/>never able to suppose that other people could feel differently from<br/>himself, he was very much disposed to think Miss Taylor had done as<br/>sad a thing for herself as for them, and would have been a great<br/>deal happier if she had spent all the rest of her life at<br/>Hartfield. Emma smiled and chatted as cheerfully as she could, to<br/>keep him from such thoughts; but when tea came, it was impossible<br/>for him not to say exactly as he had said at dinner,<br/><br/>"Poor Miss Taylor!—I wish she were here again. What a pity it is<br/>that Mr. Weston ever thought of her!"<br/><br/>"I cannot agree with you, papa; you know I cannot. Mr. Weston is<br/>such a good-humoured, pleasant, excellent man, that he thoroughly<br/>deserves a good wife;—and you would not have had Miss Taylor live<br/>with us for ever, and bear all my odd humours, when she might have<br/>a house of her own?"<br/><br/>"A house of her own!—But where is the advantage of a house of<br/>her own? This is three times as large.—And you have never any odd<br/>humours, my dear."<br/><br/>"How often we shall be going to see them, and they coming to see<br/>us!—We shall be always meeting! We must begin; we must go and pay<br/>wedding visit very soon."<br/><br/>"My dear, how am I to get so far? Randalls is such a distance. I<br/>could not walk half so far."<br/><br/>"No, papa, nobody thought of your walking. We must go in the<br/>carriage, to be sure."<br/><br/>"The carriage! But James will not like to put the horses to for<br/>such a little way;—and where are the poor horses to be while we are<br/>paying our visit?"<br/>
