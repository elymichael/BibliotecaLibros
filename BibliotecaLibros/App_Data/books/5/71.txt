"I am most happy to hear it—but only Jane Fairfax one knows to
be so very accomplished and superior!—and exactly Emma's age."

This topic was discussed very happily, and others succeeded of
similar moment, and passed away with similar harmony; but the
evening did not close without a little return of agitation. The
gruel came and supplied a great deal to be said—much praise and
many comments— undoubting decision of its wholesomeness for every
constitution, and pretty severe Philippics upon the many houses
where it was never met with tolerable;—but, unfortunately, among
the failures which the daughter had to instance, the most recent,
and therefore most prominent, was in her own cook at South End, a
young woman hired for the time, who never had been able to
understand what she meant by a basin of nice smooth gruel, thin,
but not too thin. Often as she had wished for and ordered it, she
had never been able to get any thing tolerable. Here was a
dangerous opening.

"Ah!" said Mr. Woodhouse, shaking his head and fixing his eyes
on her with tender concern.—The ejaculation in Emma's ear
expressed, "Ah! there is no end of the sad consequences of your
going to South End. It does not bear talking of." And for a little
while she hoped he would not talk of it, and that a silent
rumination might suffice to restore him to the relish of his own
smooth gruel. After an interval of some minutes, however, he began
with,

"I shall always be very sorry that you went to the sea this
autumn, instead of coming here."

"But why should you be sorry, sir?—I assure you, it did the
children a great deal of good."

"And, moreover, if you must go to the sea, it had better not
have been to South End. South End is an unhealthy place. Perry was
surprized to hear you had fixed upon South End."

"I know there is such an idea with many people, but indeed it is
quite a mistake, sir.—We all had our health perfectly well there,
never found the least inconvenience from the mud; and Mr. Wingfield
says it is entirely a mistake to suppose the place unhealthy; and I
am sure he may be depended on, for he thoroughly understands the
nature of the air, and his own brother and family have been there
repeatedly."

"You should have gone to Cromer, my dear, if you went anywhere.—
Perry was a week at Cromer once, and he holds it to be the best of
all the sea-bathing places. A fine open sea, he says, and very pure
air. And, by what I understand, you might have had lodgings there
quite away from the sea—a quarter of a mile off—very comfortable.
You should have consulted Perry."

"But, my dear sir, the difference of the journey;—only consider
how great it would have been.—An hundred miles, perhaps, instead of
forty."

"Ah! my dear, as Perry says, where health is at stake, nothing
else should be considered; and if one is to travel, there is not
much to chuse between forty miles and an hundred.—Better not move
at all, better stay in London altogether than travel forty miles to
get into a worse air. This is just what Perry said. It seemed to
him a very ill-judged measure."

Emma's attempts to stop her father had been vain; and when he
had reached such a point as this, she could not wonder at her
brother-in-law's breaking out.
