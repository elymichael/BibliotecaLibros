In this state Frank Churchill had found her, she trembling and<br/>conditioning, they loud and insolent. By a most fortunate chance<br/>his leaving Highbury had been delayed so as to bring him to her<br/>assistance at this critical moment. The pleasantness of the morning<br/>had induced him to walk forward, and leave his horses to meet him<br/>by another road, a mile or two beyond Highbury— and happening to<br/>have borrowed a pair of scissors the night before of Miss Bates,<br/>and to have forgotten to restore them, he had been obliged to stop<br/>at her door, and go in for a few minutes: he was therefore later<br/>than he had intended; and being on foot, was unseen by the whole<br/>party till almost close to them. The terror which the woman and boy<br/>had been creating in Harriet was then their own portion. He had<br/>left them completely frightened; and Harriet eagerly clinging to<br/>him, and hardly able to speak, had just strength enough to reach<br/>Hartfield, before her spirits were quite overcome. It was his idea<br/>to bring her to Hartfield: he had thought of no other place.<br/><br/>This was the amount of the whole story,—of his communication and<br/>of Harriet's as soon as she had recovered her senses and speech.—<br/>He dared not stay longer than to see her well; these several delays<br/>left him not another minute to lose; and Emma engaging to give<br/>assurance of her safety to Mrs. Goddard, and notice of there being<br/>such a set of people in the neighbourhood to Mr. Knightley, he set<br/>off, with all the grateful blessings that she could utter for her<br/>friend and herself.<br/><br/>Such an adventure as this,—a fine young man and a lovely young<br/>woman thrown together in such a way, could hardly fail of<br/>suggesting certain ideas to the coldest heart and the steadiest<br/>brain. So Emma thought, at least. Could a linguist, could a<br/>grammarian, could even a mathematician have seen what she did, have<br/>witnessed their appearance together, and heard their history of it,<br/>without feeling that circumstances had been at work to make them<br/>peculiarly interesting to each other?—How much more must an<br/>imaginist, like herself, be on fire with speculation and<br/>foresight!—especially with such a groundwork of anticipation as her<br/>mind had already made.<br/><br/>It was a very extraordinary thing! Nothing of the sort had ever<br/>occurred before to any young ladies in the place, within her<br/>memory; no rencontre, no alarm of the kind;—and now it had happened<br/>to the very person, and at the very hour, when the other very<br/>person was chancing to pass by to rescue her!—It certainly was very<br/>extraordinary!—And knowing, as she did, the favourable state of<br/>mind of each at this period, it struck her the more. He was wishing<br/>to get the better of his attachment to herself, she just recovering<br/>from her mania for Mr. Elton. It seemed as if every thing united to<br/>promise the most interesting consequences. It was not possible that<br/>the occurrence should not be strongly recommending each to the<br/>other.<br/><br/>In the few minutes' conversation which she had yet had with him,<br/>while Harriet had been partially insensible, he had spoken of her<br/>terror, her naivete, her fervour as she seized and clung to his<br/>arm, with a sensibility amused and delighted; and just at last,<br/>after Harriet's own account had been given, he had expressed his<br/>indignation at the abominable folly of Miss Bickerton in the<br/>warmest terms. Every thing was to take its natural course, however,<br/>neither impelled nor assisted. She would not stir a step, nor drop<br/>a hint. No, she had had enough of interference. There could be no<br/>harm in a scheme, a mere passive scheme. It was no more than a<br/>wish. Beyond it she would on no account proceed.<br/><br/>Emma's first resolution was to keep her father from the<br/>knowledge of what had passed,—aware of the anxiety and alarm it<br/>would occasion: but she soon felt that concealment must be<br/>impossible. Within half an hour it was known all over Highbury. It<br/>was the very event to engage those who talk most, the young and the<br/>low; and all the youth and servants in the place were soon in the<br/>happiness of frightful news. The last night's ball seemed lost in<br/>the gipsies. Poor Mr. Woodhouse trembled as he sat, and, as Emma<br/>had foreseen, would scarcely be satisfied without their promising<br/>never to go beyond the shrubbery again. It was some comfort to him<br/>that many inquiries after himself and Miss Woodhouse (for his<br/>neighbours knew that he loved to be inquired after), as well as<br/>Miss Smith, were coming in during the rest of the day; and he had<br/>the pleasure of returning for answer, that they were all very<br/>indifferent— which, though not exactly true, for she was perfectly<br/>well, and Harriet not much otherwise, Emma would not interfere<br/>with. She had an unhappy state of health in general for the child<br/>of such a man, for she hardly knew what indisposition was; and if<br/>he did not invent illnesses for her, she could make no figure in a<br/>message.<br/><br/>The gipsies did not wait for the operations of justice; they<br/>took themselves off in a hurry. The young ladies of Highbury might<br/>have walked again in safety before their panic began, and the whole<br/>history dwindled soon into a matter of little importance but to<br/>Emma and her nephews:—in her imagination it maintained its ground,<br/>and Henry and John were still asking every day for the story of<br/>Harriet and the gipsies, and still tenaciously setting her right if<br/>she varied in the slightest particular from the original<br/>recital.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
