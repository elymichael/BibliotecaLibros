<br/>"Yes," said Mr. John Knightley presently, with some slyness, "he<br/>seems to have a great deal of good-will towards you."<br/><br/>"Me!" she replied with a smile of astonishment, "are you<br/>imagining me to be Mr. Elton's object?"<br/><br/>"Such an imagination has crossed me, I own, Emma; and if it<br/>never occurred to you before, you may as well take it into<br/>consideration now."<br/><br/>"Mr. Elton in love with me!—What an idea!"<br/><br/>"I do not say it is so; but you will do well to consider whether<br/>it is so or not, and to regulate your behaviour accordingly. I<br/>think your manners to him encouraging. I speak as a friend, Emma.<br/>You had better look about you, and ascertain what you do, and what<br/>you mean to do."<br/><br/>"I thank you; but I assure you you are quite mistaken. Mr. Elton<br/>and I are very good friends, and nothing more;" and she walked on,<br/>amusing herself in the consideration of the blunders which often<br/>arise from a partial knowledge of circumstances, of the mistakes<br/>which people of high pretensions to judgment are for ever falling<br/>into; and not very well pleased with her brother for imagining her<br/>blind and ignorant, and in want of counsel. He said no more.<br/><br/>Mr. Woodhouse had so completely made up his mind to the visit,<br/>that in spite of the increasing coldness, he seemed to have no idea<br/>of shrinking from it, and set forward at last most punctually with<br/>his eldest daughter in his own carriage, with less apparent<br/>consciousness of the weather than either of the others; too full of<br/>the wonder of his own going, and the pleasure it was to afford at<br/>Randalls to see that it was cold, and too well wrapt up to feel it.<br/>The cold, however, was severe; and by the time the second carriage<br/>was in motion, a few flakes of snow were finding their way down,<br/>and the sky had the appearance of being so overcharged as to want<br/>only a milder air to produce a very white world in a very short<br/>time.<br/><br/>Emma soon saw that her companion was not in the happiest humour.<br/>The preparing and the going abroad in such weather, with the<br/>sacrifice of his children after dinner, were evils, were<br/>disagreeables at least, which Mr. John Knightley did not by any<br/>means like; he anticipated nothing in the visit that could be at<br/>all worth the purchase; and the whole of their drive to the<br/>vicarage was spent by him in expressing his discontent.<br/><br/>"A man," said he, "must have a very good opinion of himself when<br/>he asks people to leave their own fireside, and encounter such a<br/>day as this, for the sake of coming to see him. He must think<br/>himself a most agreeable fellow; I could not do such a thing. It is<br/>the greatest absurdity—Actually snowing at this moment!— The folly<br/>of not allowing people to be comfortable at home—and the folly of<br/>people's not staying comfortably at home when they can! If we were<br/>obliged to go out such an evening as this, by any call of duty or<br/>business, what a hardship we should deem it;—and here are we,<br/>probably with rather thinner clothing than usual, setting forward<br/>voluntarily, without excuse, in defiance of the voice of nature,<br/>which tells man, in every thing given to his view or his feelings,<br/>to stay at home himself, and keep all under shelter that he can;—<br/>here are we setting forward to spend five dull hours in another<br/>man's house, with nothing to say or to hear that was not said and<br/>heard yesterday, and may not be said and heard again to-morrow.<br/>Going in dismal weather, to return probably in worse;—four horses<br/>and four servants taken out for nothing but to convey five idle,<br/>shivering creatures into colder rooms and worse company than they<br/>might have had at home."<br/><br/>Emma did not find herself equal to give the pleased assent,<br/>which no doubt he was in the habit of receiving, to emulate the<br/>"Very true, my love," which must have been usually administered by<br/>his travelling companion; but she had resolution enough to refrain<br/>from making any answer at all. She could not be complying, she<br/>dreaded being quarrelsome; her heroism reached only to silence. She<br/>allowed him to talk, and arranged the glasses, and wrapped herself<br/>up, without opening her lips.<br/><br/>
