<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>10<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>Though now the middle of December, there had yet been no weather<br/>to prevent the young ladies from tolerably regular exercise; and on<br/>the morrow, Emma had a charitable visit to pay to a poor sick<br/>family, who lived a little way out of Highbury.<br/><br/>Their road to this detached cottage was down Vicarage Lane, a<br/>lane leading at right angles from the broad, though irregular, main<br/>street of the place; and, as may be inferred, containing the<br/>blessed abode of Mr. Elton. A few inferior dwellings were first to<br/>be passed, and then, about a quarter of a mile down the lane rose<br/>the Vicarage, an old and not very good house, almost as close to<br/>the road as it could be. It had no advantage of situation; but had<br/>been very much smartened up by the present proprietor; and, such as<br/>it was, there could be no possibility of the two friends passing it<br/>without a slackened pace and observing eyes.—Emma's remark was—<br/><br/>"There it is. There go you and your riddle-book one of these<br/>days."— Harriet's was—<br/><br/>"Oh, what a sweet house!—How very beautiful!—There are the<br/>yellow curtains that Miss Nash admires so much."<br/><br/>"I do not often walk this way now," said Emma, as they<br/>proceeded, "but then there will be an inducement, and I shall<br/>gradually get intimately acquainted with all the hedges, gates,<br/>pools and pollards of this part of Highbury."<br/><br/>Harriet, she found, had never in her life been within side the<br/>Vicarage, and her curiosity to see it was so extreme, that,<br/>considering exteriors and probabilities, Emma could only class it,<br/>as a proof of love, with Mr. Elton's seeing ready wit in her.<br/><br/>
