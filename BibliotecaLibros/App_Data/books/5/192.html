She was stopped by a slight fit of coughing, and Mr. Weston<br/>instantly seized the opportunity of going on.<br/><br/>"You were mentioning May. May is the very month which Mrs.<br/>Churchill is ordered, or has ordered herself, to spend in some<br/>warmer place than Enscombe—in short, to spend in London; so that we<br/>have the agreeable prospect of frequent visits from Frank the whole<br/>spring— precisely the season of the year which one should have<br/>chosen for it: days almost at the longest; weather genial and<br/>pleasant, always inviting one out, and never too hot for exercise.<br/>When he was here before, we made the best of it; but there was a<br/>good deal of wet, damp, cheerless weather; there always is in<br/>February, you know, and we could not do half that we intended. Now<br/>will be the time. This will be complete enjoyment; and I do not<br/>know, Mrs. Elton, whether the uncertainty of our meetings, the sort<br/>of constant expectation there will be of his coming in to-day or<br/>to-morrow, and at any hour, may not be more friendly to happiness<br/>than having him actually in the house. I think it is so. I think it<br/>is the state of mind which gives most spirit and delight. I hope<br/>you will be pleased with my son; but you must not expect a prodigy.<br/>He is generally thought a fine young man, but do not expect a<br/>prodigy. Mrs. Weston's partiality for him is very great, and, as<br/>you may suppose, most gratifying to me. She thinks nobody equal to<br/>him."<br/><br/>"And I assure you, Mr. Weston, I have very little doubt that my<br/>opinion will be decidedly in his favour. I have heard so much in<br/>praise of Mr. Frank Churchill.—At the same time it is fair to<br/>observe, that I am one of those who always judge for themselves,<br/>and are by no means implicitly guided by others. I give you notice<br/>that as I find your son, so I shall judge of him.—I am no<br/>flatterer."<br/><br/>Mr. Weston was musing.<br/><br/>"I hope," said he presently, "I have not been severe upon poor<br/>Mrs. Churchill. If she is ill I should be sorry to do her<br/>injustice; but there are some traits in her character which make it<br/>difficult for me to speak of her with the forbearance I could wish.<br/>You cannot be ignorant, Mrs. Elton, of my connexion with the<br/>family, nor of the treatment I have met with; and, between<br/>ourselves, the whole blame of it is to be laid to her. She was the<br/>instigator. Frank's mother would never have been slighted as she<br/>was but for her. Mr. Churchill has pride; but his pride is nothing<br/>to his wife's: his is a quiet, indolent, gentlemanlike sort of<br/>pride that would harm nobody, and only make himself a little<br/>helpless and tiresome; but her pride is arrogance and insolence!<br/>And what inclines one less to bear, she has no fair pretence of<br/>family or blood. She was nobody when he married her, barely the<br/>daughter of a gentleman; but ever since her being turned into a<br/>Churchill she has out-Churchill'd them all in high and mighty<br/>claims: but in herself, I assure you, she is an upstart."<br/><br/>"Only think! well, that must be infinitely provoking! I have<br/>quite a horror of upstarts. Maple Grove has given me a thorough<br/>disgust to people of that sort; for there is a family in that<br/>neighbourhood who are such an annoyance to my brother and sister<br/>from the airs they give themselves! Your description of Mrs.<br/>Churchill made me think of them directly. People of the name of<br/>Tupman, very lately settled there, and encumbered with many low<br/>connexions, but giving themselves immense airs, and expecting to be<br/>on a footing with the old established families. A year and a half<br/>is the very utmost that they can have lived at West Hall; and how<br/>they got their fortune nobody knows. They came from Birmingham,<br/>which is not a place to promise much, you know, Mr. Weston. One has<br/>not great hopes from Birmingham. I always say there is something<br/>direful in the sound: but nothing more is positively known of the<br/>Tupmans, though a good many things I assure you are suspected; and<br/>yet by their manners they evidently think themselves equal even to<br/>my brother, Mr. Suckling, who happens to be one of their nearest<br/>neighbours. It is infinitely too bad. Mr. Suckling, who has been<br/>eleven years a resident at Maple Grove, and whose father had it<br/>before him—I believe, at least—I am almost sure that old Mr.<br/>Suckling had completed the purchase before his death."<br/><br/>They were interrupted. Tea was carrying round, and Mr. Weston,<br/>having said all that he wanted, soon took the opportunity of<br/>walking away.<br/><br/>After tea, Mr. and Mrs. Weston, and Mr. Elton sat down with Mr.<br/>Woodhouse to cards. The remaining five were left to their own<br/>powers, and Emma doubted their getting on very well; for Mr.<br/>Knightley seemed little disposed for conversation; Mrs. Elton was<br/>wanting notice, which nobody had inclination to pay, and she was<br/>herself in a worry of spirits which would have made her prefer<br/>being silent.<br/><br/>Mr. John Knightley proved more talkative than his brother. He<br/>was to leave them early the next day; and he soon began with—<br/><br/>"Well, Emma, I do not believe I have any thing more to say about<br/>the boys; but you have your sister's letter, and every thing is<br/>down at full length there we may be sure. My charge would be much<br/>more concise than her's, and probably not much in the same spirit;<br/>all that I have to recommend being comprised in, do not spoil them,<br/>and do not physic them."<br/><br/>"I rather hope to satisfy you both," said Emma, "for I shall do<br/>all in my power to make them happy, which will be enough for<br/>Isabella; and happiness must preclude false indulgence and<br/>physic."<br/>
