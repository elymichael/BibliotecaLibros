<br/>Emma wished she had been alone with Mrs. Weston. She should then<br/>have heard more: Mrs. Weston would speak to her, with a degree of<br/>unreserve which she would not hazard with Isabella; and, she really<br/>believed, would scarcely try to conceal any thing relative to the<br/>Churchills from her, excepting those views on the young man, of<br/>which her own imagination had already given her such instinctive<br/>knowledge. But at present there was nothing more to be said. Mr.<br/>Woodhouse very soon followed them into the drawing-room. To be<br/>sitting long after dinner, was a confinement that he could not<br/>endure. Neither wine nor conversation was any thing to him; and<br/>gladly did he move to those with whom he was always<br/>comfortable.<br/><br/>While he talked to Isabella, however, Emma found an opportunity<br/>of saying,<br/><br/>"And so you do not consider this visit from your son as by any<br/>means certain. I am sorry for it. The introduction must be<br/>unpleasant, whenever it takes place; and the sooner it could be<br/>over, the better."<br/><br/>"Yes; and every delay makes one more apprehensive of other<br/>delays. Even if this family, the Braithwaites, are put off, I am<br/>still afraid that some excuse may be found for disappointing us. I<br/>cannot bear to imagine any reluctance on his side; but I am sure<br/>there is a great wish on the Churchills' to keep him to themselves.<br/>There is jealousy. They are jealous even of his regard for his<br/>father. In short, I can feel no dependence on his coming, and I<br/>wish Mr. Weston were less sanguine."<br/><br/>"He ought to come," said Emma. "If he could stay only a couple<br/>of days, he ought to come; and one can hardly conceive a young<br/>man's not having it in his power to do as much as that. A young<br/>woman, if she fall into bad hands, may be teazed, and kept at a<br/>distance from those she wants to be with; but one cannot comprehend<br/>a young man's being under such restraint, as not to be able to<br/>spend a week with his father, if he likes it."<br/><br/>"One ought to be at Enscombe, and know the ways of the family,<br/>before one decides upon what he can do," replied Mrs. Weston. "One<br/>ought to use the same caution, perhaps, in judging of the conduct<br/>of any one individual of any one family; but Enscombe, I believe,<br/>certainly must not be judged by general rules: she is so very<br/>unreasonable; and every thing gives way to her."<br/><br/>"But she is so fond of the nephew: he is so very great a<br/>favourite. Now, according to my idea of Mrs. Churchill, it would be<br/>most natural, that while she makes no sacrifice for the comfort of<br/>the husband, to whom she owes every thing, while she exercises<br/>incessant caprice towards him, she should frequently be governed by<br/>the nephew, to whom she owes nothing at all."<br/><br/>"My dearest Emma, do not pretend, with your sweet temper, to<br/>understand a bad one, or to lay down rules for it: you must let it<br/>go its own way. I have no doubt of his having, at times,<br/>considerable influence; but it may be perfectly impossible for him<br/>to know beforehand when it will be."<br/><br/>Emma listened, and then coolly said, "I shall not be satisfied,<br/>unless he comes."<br/><br/>"He may have a great deal of influence on some points,"<br/>continued Mrs. Weston, "and on others, very little: and among<br/>those, on which she is beyond his reach, it is but too likely, may<br/>be this very circumstance of his coming away from them to visit<br/>us."<br/><br/>
