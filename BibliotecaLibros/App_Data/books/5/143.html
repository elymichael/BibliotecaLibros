<br/>"No trouble in the world, ma'am," said the obliging Mrs.<br/>Ford.<br/><br/>"Oh! but indeed I would much rather have it only in one. Then,<br/>if you please, you shall send it all to Mrs. Goddard's— I do not<br/>know—No, I think, Miss Woodhouse, I may just as well have it sent<br/>to Hartfield, and take it home with me at night. What do you<br/>advise?"<br/><br/>"That you do not give another half-second to the subject. To<br/>Hartfield, if you please, Mrs. Ford."<br/><br/>"Aye, that will be much best," said Harriet, quite satisfied, "I<br/>should not at all like to have it sent to Mrs. Goddard's."<br/><br/>Voices approached the shop—or rather one voice and two ladies:<br/>Mrs. Weston and Miss Bates met them at the door.<br/><br/>"My dear Miss Woodhouse," said the latter, "I am just run across<br/>to entreat the favour of you to come and sit down with us a little<br/>while, and give us your opinion of our new instrument; you and Miss<br/>Smith. How do you do, Miss Smith?—Very well I thank you.—And I<br/>begged Mrs. Weston to come with me, that I might be sure of<br/>succeeding."<br/><br/>"I hope Mrs. Bates and Miss Fairfax are—"<br/><br/>"Very well, I am much obliged to you. My mother is delightfully<br/>well; and Jane caught no cold last night. How is Mr. Woodhouse?—I<br/>am so glad to hear such a good account. Mrs. Weston told me you<br/>were here.— Oh! then, said I, I must run across, I am sure Miss<br/>Woodhouse will allow me just to run across and entreat her to come<br/>in; my mother will be so very happy to see her—and now we are such<br/>a nice party, she cannot refuse.—`Aye, pray do,' said Mr. Frank<br/>Churchill, `Miss Woodhouse's opinion of the instrument will be<br/>worth having.'— But, said I, I shall be more sure of succeeding if<br/>one of you will go with me.—`Oh,' said he, `wait half a minute,<br/>till I have finished my job;'—For, would you believe it, Miss<br/>Woodhouse, there he is, in the most obliging manner in the world,<br/>fastening in the rivet of my mother's spectacles.—The rivet came<br/>out, you know, this morning.— So very obliging!—For my mother had<br/>no use of her spectacles— could not put them on. And, by the bye,<br/>every body ought to have two pair of spectacles; they should<br/>indeed. Jane said so. I meant to take them over to John Saunders<br/>the first thing I did, but something or other hindered me all the<br/>morning; first one thing, then another, there is no saying what,<br/>you know. At one time Patty came to say she thought the kitchen<br/>chimney wanted sweeping. Oh, said I, Patty do not come with your<br/>bad news to me. Here is the rivet of your mistress's spectacles<br/>out. Then the baked apples came home, Mrs. Wallis sent them by her<br/>boy; they are extremely civil and obliging to us, the Wallises,<br/>always—I have heard some people say that Mrs. Wallis can be uncivil<br/>and give a very rude answer, but we have never known any thing but<br/>the greatest attention from them. And it cannot be for the value of<br/>our custom now, for what is our consumption of bread, you know?<br/>Only three of us.— besides dear Jane at present—and she really eats<br/>nothing—makes such a shocking breakfast, you would be quite<br/>frightened if you saw it. I dare not let my mother know how little<br/>she eats—so I say one thing and then I say another, and it passes<br/>off. But about the middle of the day she gets hungry, and there is<br/>nothing she likes so well as these baked apples, and they are<br/>extremely wholesome, for I took the opportunity the other day of<br/>asking Mr. Perry; I happened to meet him in the street. Not that I<br/>had any doubt before— I have so often heard Mr. Woodhouse recommend<br/>a baked apple. I believe it is the only way that Mr. Woodhouse<br/>thinks the fruit thoroughly wholesome. We have apple-dumplings,<br/>however, very often. Patty makes an excellent apple-dumpling. Well,<br/>Mrs. Weston, you have prevailed, I hope, and these ladies will<br/>oblige us."<br/><br/>Emma would be "very happy to wait on Mrs. Bates, &amp;c.," and<br/>they did at last move out of the shop, with no farther delay from<br/>Miss Bates than,<br/><br/>"How do you do, Mrs. Ford? I beg your pardon. I did not see you<br/>before. I hear you have a charming collection of new ribbons from<br/>town. Jane came back delighted yesterday. Thank ye, the gloves do<br/>very well—only a little too large about the wrist; but Jane is<br/>taking them in."<br/><br/>
