Mrs. Weston was most comfortably pleased on the occasion. Her
looks and words had nothing to restrain them. She was happy, she
knew she was happy, and knew she ought to be happy. Her
congratulations were warm and open; but Emma could not speak so
fluently. She was a little occupied in weighing her own feelings,
and trying to understand the degree of her agitation, which she
rather thought was considerable.

Mr. Weston, however, too eager to be very observant, too
communicative to want others to talk, was very well satisfied with
what she did say, and soon moved away to make the rest of his
friends happy by a partial communication of what the whole room
must have overheard already.

It was well that he took every body's joy for granted, or he
might not have thought either Mr. Woodhouse or Mr. Knightley
particularly delighted. They were the first entitled, after Mrs.
Weston and Emma, to be made happy;â€”from them he would have
proceeded to Miss Fairfax, but she was so deep in conversation with
John Knightley, that it would have been too positive an
interruption; and finding himself close to Mrs. Elton, and her
attention disengaged, he necessarily began on the subject with
her.
