"Nay, dear Emma, now I must take his part; for though he has
been wrong in this instance, I have known him long enough to answer
for his having many, very many, good qualities; and—"

"Good God!" cried Emma, not attending to her.—"Mrs. Smallridge,
too! Jane actually on the point of going as governess! What could
he mean by such horrible indelicacy? To suffer her to engage
herself— to suffer her even to think of such a measure!"

"He knew nothing about it, Emma. On this article I can fully
acquit him. It was a private resolution of hers, not communicated
to him—or at least not communicated in a way to carry conviction.—
Till yesterday, I know he said he was in the dark as to her plans.
They burst on him, I do not know how, but by some letter or
message— and it was the discovery of what she was doing, of this
very project of hers, which determined him to come forward at once,
own it all to his uncle, throw himself on his kindness, and, in
short, put an end to the miserable state of concealment that had
been carrying on so long."

Emma began to listen better.

"I am to hear from him soon," continued Mrs. Weston. "He told me
at parting, that he should soon write; and he spoke in a manner
which seemed to promise me many particulars that could not be given
now. Let us wait, therefore, for this letter. It may bring many
extenuations. It may make many things intelligible and excusable
which now are not to be understood. Don't let us be severe, don't
let us be in a hurry to condemn him. Let us have patience. I must
love him; and now that I am satisfied on one point, the one
material point, I am sincerely anxious for its all turning out
well, and ready to hope that it may. They must both have suffered a
great deal under such a system of secresy and concealment."

"His sufferings," replied Emma dryly, "do not appear to have
done him much harm. Well, and how did Mr. Churchill take it?"

"Most favourably for his nephew—gave his consent with scarcely a
difficulty. Conceive what the events of a week have done in that
family! While poor Mrs. Churchill lived, I suppose there could not
have been a hope, a chance, a possibility;—but scarcely are her
remains at rest in the family vault, than her husband is persuaded
to act exactly opposite to what she would have required. What a
blessing it is, when undue influence does not survive the grave!—
He gave his consent with very little persuasion."

"Ah!" thought Emma, "he would have done as much for
Harriet."

"This was settled last night, and Frank was off with the light
this morning. He stopped at Highbury, at the Bates's, I fancy, some
time—and then came on hither; but was in such a hurry to get back
to his uncle, to whom he is just now more necessary than ever,
that, as I tell you, he could stay with us but a quarter of an
hour.— He was very much agitated—very much, indeed—to a degree that
made him appear quite a different creature from any thing I had
ever seen him before.—In addition to all the rest, there had been
the shock of finding her so very unwell, which he had had no
previous suspicion of— and there was every appearance of his having
been feeling a great deal."

"And do you really believe the affair to have been carrying on
with such perfect secresy?—The Campbells, the Dixons, did none of
them know of the engagement?"

Emma could not speak the name of Dixon without a little
blush.
