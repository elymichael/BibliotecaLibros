<br/>"Mr. Perry," said he, in a voice of very strong displeasure,<br/>"would do as well to keep his opinion till it is asked for. Why<br/>does he make it any business of his, to wonder at what I do?— at my<br/>taking my family to one part of the coast or another?—I may be<br/>allowed, I hope, the use of my judgment as well as Mr. Perry.— I<br/>want his directions no more than his drugs." He paused— and growing<br/>cooler in a moment, added, with only sarcastic dryness, "If Mr.<br/>Perry can tell me how to convey a wife and five children a distance<br/>of an hundred and thirty miles with no greater expense or<br/>inconvenience than a distance of forty, I should be as willing to<br/>prefer Cromer to South End as he could himself."<br/><br/>"True, true," cried Mr. Knightley, with most ready<br/>interposition— "very true. That's a consideration indeed.—But John,<br/>as to what I was telling you of my idea of moving the path to<br/>Langham, of turning it more to the right that it may not cut<br/>through the home meadows, I cannot conceive any difficulty. I<br/>should not attempt it, if it were to be the means of inconvenience<br/>to the Highbury people, but if you call to mind exactly the present<br/>line of the path… . The only way of proving it, however, will be to<br/>turn to our maps. I shall see you at the Abbey to-morrow morning I<br/>hope, and then we will look them over, and you shall give me your<br/>opinion."<br/><br/>Mr. Woodhouse was rather agitated by such harsh reflections on<br/>his friend Perry, to whom he had, in fact, though unconsciously,<br/>been attributing many of his own feelings and expressions;— but the<br/>soothing attentions of his daughters gradually removed the present<br/>evil, and the immediate alertness of one brother, and better<br/>recollections of the other, prevented any renewal of it.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
