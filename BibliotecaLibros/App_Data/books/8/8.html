<br/><br/><br/>The Description of a New World, Called<br/>The Blazing-World.<br/><br/><br/>A Merchant travelling into a foreign Country, fell extreamly in<br/>Love with a young Lady; but being a stranger in that Nation, and<br/>beneath her, both in Birth and Wealth, he could have but little<br/>hopes of obtaining his desire; however his Love growing more and<br/>more vehement upon him, even to the slighting of all difficulties,<br/>he resolved at last to Steal her away; which he had the better<br/>opportunity to do, because her Father's house was not far from the<br/>Sea,&#160;and she often using to gather shells upon the shore<br/>accompanied not with above two to three of her servants it<br/>encouraged him the more to execute his design. Thus coming one time<br/>with a little leight Vessel, not unlike a Packet-boat, mann'd with<br/>some few Sea-men, and well victualled, for fear of some accidents,<br/>which might perhaps retard their journey, to the place where she<br/>used to repair; he forced her away: But when he fancied himself the<br/>happiest man of the World, he proved to be the most unfortunate;<br/>for Heaven frowning at his Theft, raised such a Tempest, as they<br/>knew not what to do, or whither to steer their course; so that the<br/>Vessel, both by its own leightness, and the violent motion of the<br/>Wind, was carried as swift as an Arrow out of a Bow, towards the<br/>North-pole, and in a short time reached the Icy Sea, where the wind<br/>forced it amongst huge pieces of Ice; but being little, and leight,<br/>it did by the assistance and favour of the gods to this virtuous<br/>Lady, so turn and wind through those precipices, as if it had been<br/>guided by some experienced Pilot, and skilful Mariner: But alas!<br/>Those few men which were in it, not knowing whither they went, nor<br/>what was to be done in so strange an Adventure, and not being<br/>provided for so cold a Voyage, were all frozen to death; the young<br/>Lady onely, by the light of her Beauty, the heat of her Youth, and<br/>Protection of the Gods, remaining alive: Neither was it a wonder<br/>that the men did freeze to death; for they were not<br/>onely&#160;driven to the very end or point of the Pole of that<br/>World, but even to another Pole of another World, which joined<br/>close to it; so that the cold having a double strength at the<br/>conjunction of those two Poles, was insupportable: At last, the<br/>Boat still passing on, was forced into another World; for it is<br/>impossible to round this Worlds Globe from Pole to Pole, so as we<br/>do from East to West; because the Poles of the other World, joining<br/>to the Poles of this, do not allow any further passage to surround<br/>the World that way; but if any one arrives to either of these<br/>Poles, he is either forced to return, or to enter into another<br/>World: and lest you should scruple at it, and think, if it were<br/>thus, those that live at the Poles would either see two Suns at one<br/>time, or else they would never want the Sun's light for six months<br/>together, as it is commonly believed: You must know, that each of<br/>these Worlds having its own Sun to enlighten it, they move each one<br/>in their peculiar Circles; which motion is so just and exact, that<br/>neither can hinder or obstruct the other; for they do not exceed<br/>their Tropicks: and although they should meet, yet we in this World<br/>cannot so well perceive them, by reason of the brightness of our<br/>Sun, which being nearer to us, obstructs the splendor of the Sun of<br/>the other World, they being too far off to be discerned by our<br/>optick perception, except we use very good Telescopes; by which,<br/>skilful Astronomers have often observed two or three Suns at<br/>once.&#160;But to return to the wandering Boat, and the distresed<br/>Lady; she seeing all the Men dead, found small comfort in life;<br/>their Bodies which were preserved all that while from putrefaction<br/>and stench, by the extremity of cold, began now to thaw, and<br/>corrupt; whereupon she having not strength enough to fling them<br/>over-board, was forced to remove out of her small Cabine, upon the<br/>deck, to avoid the nauseous smell; and finding the Boat swim<br/>between two plains of Ice, as a stream that runs betwixt two<br/>shores, at last perceived land, but covered all with Snow: from<br/>which came, walking upon the Ice, strange Creatures, in shape like<br/>Bears, only they went upright as men; those Creatures coming near<br/>the Boat, catched hold of it with their Paws, that served them<br/>instead of hands; some two or three of them entred first; and when<br/>they came out, the rest went in one after another; at last having<br/>viewed and observed all that was in the Boat, they spake to each<br/>other in a language which the Lady did not understand; and having<br/>carried her out of the Boat, sunk it, together with the dead<br/>men.<br/><br/>The Lady now finding her self in so strange a place, and amongst<br/>such wonderful kind of Creatures, was extreamly strucken with fear,<br/>and could entertain no other Thoughts, but that every moment her<br/>life was to be a sacrifice to their cruelty; but those Bear-like<br/>Creatures, how terrible soever they appear'd to her sight, yet were<br/>they so far from exercising any cruelty&#160;upon her, that rather<br/>they shewed her all civility and kindness imaginable; for she being<br/>not able to go upon the Ice, by reason of its slipperiness, they<br/>took her up in their rough arms, and carried her into their City,<br/>where instead of Houses, they had Caves under ground; and as soon<br/>as they enter'd the City, both Males and Females, young and old,<br/>flockt together to see this Lady, holding up their Paws in<br/>admiration; at last having brought her into a certain large and<br/>spacious Cave, which they intended for her reception, they left her<br/>to the custody of the Females, who entertained her with all<br/>kindness and respect, and gave her such victuals as they used to<br/>eat; but seeing her Constitution neither agreed with the temper of<br/>that Climate, nor their Diet, they were resolved to carry her into<br/>another Island of a warmer temper; in which were men like Foxes,<br/>onely walking in an upright shape, who received their neighbours<br/>the Bear-men with great civility and Courtship, very much admiring<br/>this beauteous Lady; and having discoursed some while together,<br/>agreed at last to make her a Present to the Emperor of their World;<br/>to which end, after she had made some short stay in the same place,<br/>they brought her cross that Island to a large River, whose stream<br/>run smooth and clear, like Chrystal; in which were numerous Boats,<br/>much like our Fox-traps; in one whereof she was carried, some of<br/>the Bear- and Fox-men waiting on her; and as soon as they<br/>had&#160;crossed the River, they came into an Island where there<br/>were Men which had heads, beaks and feathers, like wild-Geese,<br/>onely they went in an upright shape, like the Bear-men and Fox-men:<br/>their rumps they carried between their legs, their wings were of<br/>the same length with their Bodies, and their tails of an<br/>indifferent size, trailing after them like a Ladie's Garment; and<br/>after the Bear- and Fox-men had declared their intention and design<br/>to their Neighbours, the Geese- or Bird-men, some of them joined to<br/>the rest, and attended the Lady through that Island, till they came<br/>to another great and large River, where there was a preparation<br/>made of many Boats, much like Birds nests, onely of a bigger size;<br/>and having crost that River, they arrived into another Island,<br/>which was of a pleasant and mild temper, full of Woods and the<br/>Inhabitants thereof were Satyrs, who received both the Bear- Fox-<br/>and Bird men, with all respect and civility; and after some<br/>conferences (for they all understood each others language) some<br/>chief of the Satyrs joining to them, accompanied the Lady out of<br/>that Island to another River, wherein were many handsome and<br/>commodious Barges; and having crost that River, they entered into a<br/>large and spacious Kingdom, the men whereof were of a Grass-Green<br/>Complexion, who entertained them very kindly, and provided all<br/>conveniences for their further voyage: hitherto they had onely<br/>crost Rivers, but now they&#160;could not avoid the open Seas any<br/>longer; wherefore they made their Ships and tacklings ready to sail<br/>over into the Island, where the Emperor of the Blazing- world (for<br/>so it was call'd) kept his residence. Very good Navigators they<br/>were; and though they had no knowledg of the Load-stone, or Needle<br/>or pendulous Watches, yet (which was as serviceable to them) they<br/>had subtile observations, and great practice; in so much that they<br/>could not onely tell the depth of the Sea in every place, but where<br/>there were shelves of Sand, Rocks, and other obstructions to be<br/>avoided by skilful and experienced Sea-men: Besides, they were<br/>excellent Augurers, which skill they counted more necessary and<br/>beneficial then the use of Compasses, Cards, Watches, and the like;<br/>but, above the rest, they had an extraordinary Art, much to be<br/>taken notice of by Experimental Philosophers, and that was a<br/>certain Engin, which would draw in a great quantity of Air, and<br/>shoot forth Wind with a great force; this Engine in a calm, they<br/>placed behind their Ships, and in a storm, before; for it served<br/>against the raging waves, like Cannons against an hostile Army, or<br/>besieged Town; it would batter and beat the waves in pieces, were<br/>they as high as Steeples; and as soon as a breach was made, they<br/>forced their passage through, in spight even of the most furious<br/>wind, using two of those Engins at every Ship, one before, to beat<br/>off the waves, and another behind to drive it on; so that the<br/>artificial wind had the&#160;better of the natural; for, it had a<br/>greater advantage of the waves, then the natural of the Ships: the<br/>natural being above the face of the Water, could not without a down<br/>right motion enter or press into the Ships; whereas the artificial<br/>with a sideward-motion, did pierce into the bowels of the Waves:<br/>Moreover, it is to be observed, that in a great Tempest they would<br/>join their Ships in battel-aray: and when they feared Wind and<br/>Waves would be too strong for them, if they divided their Ships;<br/>they joined as many together as the compass or advantage of the<br/>places of the Liquid Element would give them leave. For, their<br/>Ships were so ingeniously contrived, that they could fasten them<br/>together as close as a Honey-comb, without waste of place; and<br/>being thus united, no Wind nor Waves were able to separate them.<br/>The Emperor's Ships, were all of Gold; but the Merchants and<br/>Skippers, of Leather; the Golden Ships were not much heavier then<br/>ours of Wood, by reason they were neatly made, and required not<br/>such thickness, neither were they troubled with Pitch, Tar, Pumps,<br/>Guns, and the like, which make our Woodden-Ships very heavy; for<br/>though they were not all of a piece, yet they were so well<br/>sodder'd, that there was no fear of Leaks, Chinks, or Clefts; and<br/>as for Guns, there was no use of them, because they had no other<br/>enemies but the Winds: But the Leather Ships were not altogether so<br/>sure, although much leighter; besides, they were pitched to keep<br/>out Water.<br/><br/>Having thus prepar'd, and order'd their Navy, they went on in<br/>despight of Calm or Storm: And though the Lady at first fancied her<br/>self in a very sad condition, and her mind was much tormented with<br/>doubts and fears, not knowing whether this strange Adventure would<br/>tend to her safety or destruction; yet she being withal of a<br/>generous spirit, and ready wit, considering what dangers she had<br/>past, and finding those sorts of men civil and diligent attendants<br/>to her, took courage, and endeavoured to learn their language;<br/>which after she had obtained so far, that partly by some words and<br/>signs she was able to apprehend their meaning, she was so far from<br/>being afraid of them, that she thought her self not onely safe, but<br/>very happy in their company: By which we may see, that Novelty<br/>discomposes the mind, but acquaintance settles it in peace and<br/>tranquillity. At last, having passed by several rich Islands and<br/>Kingdoms, they went towards Paradise, which was the seat of the<br/>Emperor; and coming in sight of it, rejoiced very much; the Lady at<br/>first could perceive nothing but high Rocks, which seemed to touch<br/>the Skies; and although they appear'd not of an equal heigth, yet<br/>they seemed to be all one piece, without partitions: but at last<br/>drawing nearer, she perceived a clift, which was a part of those<br/>Rocks, out of which she spied coming forth a great number of Boats,<br/>which afar off shewed like a company of Ants, marching one after<br/>another; the Boats appeared like the holes or&#160;partitions in a<br/>Honey-comb, and when joined together, stood as close; the men were<br/>of several Complexions, but none like any of our World; and when<br/>both the Boats and Ships met, they saluted and spake to each other<br/>very courteously; for there was but one language in all that World:<br/>nor no more but one Emperor, to whom they all submitted with the<br/>greatest duty and obedience, which made them live in a continued<br/>Peace and Happiness; not acquainted with Foreign Wars or Home-bred<br/>Insurrections. The Lady now being arrived at this place, was<br/>carried out of her Ship into one of those Boats, and conveighed<br/>through the same passage (for there was no other) into that part of<br/>the World where the Emperor did reside; which part was very<br/>pleasant, and of a mild temper: Within it self it was divided by a<br/>great number of vast and large Rivers, all ebbing and flowing, into<br/>several Islands of unequal distance from each other, which in most<br/>parts were as pleasant, healthful, rich, and fruitful, as Nature<br/>could make them; and, as I mentioned before, secure from all<br/>Foreign Invasions, by reason there was but one way to enter, and<br/>that like a Labyrinth, so winding and turning among the Rocks, that<br/>no other Vessels but small Boats, could pass, carrying not above<br/>three passengers at a time: On each side all along the narrow and<br/>winding River, there were several Cities, some of Marble, some of<br/>Alabaster, some of Agat, some of Amber, some of Coral, and some of<br/>other&#160;precious materials not known in our world; all which<br/>after the Lady had passed, she came to the Imperial City, named<br/>Paradise, which appeared in form like several Islands; for, Rivers<br/>did run betwixt every street, which together with the Bridges,<br/>whereof there was a great number, were all paved. The City it self<br/>was built of Gold; and their Architectures were noble, stately, and<br/>magnificent, not like our Modern, but like those in the Romans<br/>time; for, our Modern Buildings are like those Houses which<br/>Children use to make of Cards, one story above another, fitter for<br/>Birds, then Men; but theirs were more Large, and Broad, then high;<br/>the highest of them did not exceed two stories, besides those rooms<br/>that were under-ground, as Cellars, and other Offices. The<br/>Emperor's Palace stood upon an indifferent ascent from the Imperial<br/>City; at the top of which ascent was a broad Arch, supported by<br/>several Pillars, which went round the Palace, and contained four of<br/>our English miles in compass: within the Arch stood the Emperor's<br/>Guard, which consisted of several sorts of Men; at every half mile,<br/>was a Gate to enter, and every Gate was of a different fashion; the<br/>first, which allowed a passage from the Imperial City into the<br/>Palace, had on either hand a Cloyster, the outward part whereof<br/>stood upon Arches sustained by Pillars, but the inner part was<br/>close: Being entred through the Gate, the Palace it self appear'd<br/>in its middle like the Isle of a Church, a mile and&#160;a half<br/>long, and half a mile broad; the roof of it was all Arched, and<br/>rested upon Pillars, so artificially placed that a stranger would<br/>lose himself therein without a Guide; at the extream sides, that<br/>is, between the outward and inward part of the Cloyster, were<br/>Lodgings for Attendants; and in the midst of the Palace, the<br/>Emperor's own Rooms; whose Lights were placed at the top of every<br/>one, because of the heat of the Sun: the Emperor's appartment for<br/>State was no more inclosed then the rest; onely an Imperial Throne<br/>was in every appartment, of which the several adornments could not<br/>be perceived until one entered, because the Pillars were so just<br/>opposite to one another, that all the adornments could not be seen<br/>at one. The first part of the Palace was, as the Imperial City, all<br/>of Gold; and when it came to the Emperors appartment, it was so<br/>rich with Diamonds, Pearls, Rubies, and the like precious Stones,<br/>that it surpasses my skill to enumerate them all. Amongst the rest,<br/>the Imperial Room of State appear'd most magnificent; it was paved<br/>with green Diamonds (for there are in that World Diamonds of all<br/>Colours) so artificially, as it seemed but of one piece; the<br/>Pillars were set with Diamonds so close, and in such a manner, that<br/>they appear'd most Glorious to the sight; between every Pillar was<br/>a Bow or Arch of a certain sort of Diamonds, the like whereof our<br/>World does not afford; which being placed in every one of the<br/>Arches in several rows, seemed just like so many Rain-bows&#160;of<br/>several different colours. The roof of the Arches was of blew<br/>Diamonds, and in the midst thereof was a Carbuncle, which<br/>represented the Sun; and the Rising and Setting-Sun at the East and<br/>West-side of the Room were made of Rubies. Out of this Room there<br/>was a passage into the Emperor's Bed-Chamber, the Walls whereof<br/>were of Jet, and the Floor of black Marble; the Roof was of Mother<br/>of Pearl, where the Moon and Blazing-Stars were represented by<br/>white Diamonds, and his Bed was made of Diamonds and<br/>Carbuncles.<br/><br/>No sooner was the Lady brought before the Emperor, but he<br/>conceived her to be some Goddess, and offered to worship her; which<br/>she refused, telling him, (for by that time she had pretty well<br/>learned their Language) that although she came out of another<br/>world, yet was she but a mortal. At which the Emperor rejoycing,<br/>made her his Wife, and gave her an absolute power to rule and<br/>govern all that World as she pleased. But her subjects, who could<br/>hardly be perswaded to believe her mortal, tender'd her all the<br/>Veneration and Worship due to a Deity.<br/><br/>Her Accoustrement after she was made Empress, was as followeth:<br/>On her head she wore a Cap of Pearl, and a Half-moon of Diamonds<br/>just before it; on the top of her Crown came spreading over a broad<br/>Carbuncle, cut in the form of the Sun; her Coat was of Pearl, mixt<br/>with blew Diamonds, and frindged&#160;with red ones; her Buskins<br/>and Sandals were of green Diamonds; In her left hand she held a<br/>Buckler, to signifie the Defence of her Dominions; which Buckler<br/>was made of that sort of Diamond as has several different Colours;<br/>and being cut and made in the form of an Arch, shewed like a<br/>Rain-bow; In her right hand she carried a Spear made of white<br/>Diamond, cut like the tail of a Blazing Star, which signified that<br/>she was ready to assault those that proved her Enemies.<br/><br/>None was allowed to use or wear Gold but those of the Imperial<br/>Race, which were the onely Nobles of the State; nor durst any one<br/>wear Jewels but the Emperor, the Empress and their Eldest Son;<br/>notwithstanding that they had an infinite quantity both of Gold and<br/>precious Stones in that World; for they had larger extents of Gold,<br/>then our Arabian Sands; their precious Stones were Rocks, and their<br/>Diamonds of several Colours; they used no Coyn, but all their<br/>Traffick was by exchange of several Commodities.<br/><br/>Their Priests and Governors were Princes of the Imperial Blood,<br/>and made Eunuches for that purpose; and as for the ordinary sort of<br/>men in that part of the World where the Emperor resided, they were<br/>of several Complexions; not white, black, tawny, olive or<br/>ash-coloured; but some appear'd of an Azure, some of a deep Purple,<br/>some of a Grass-green, some of a Scarlet, some of an Orange-colour,<br/>&amp;c. Which Colours and Complexions, whether they were made<br/>by&#160;the bare reflection of light, without the assistance of<br/>small particles; or by the help of well-ranged and order'd Atoms;<br/>or by a continual agitation of little Globules; or by some pressing<br/>and re-acting motion, I am not able to determine. The rest of the<br/>Inhabitants of that World, were men of several different sorts,<br/>shapes, figures, dispositions, and humors, as I have already made<br/>mention, heretofore; some were Bear-men, some Worm-men, some Fish-<br/>or Mear-men, otherwise called Syrens; some Bird-men, some Fly-men,<br/>some Ant-men, some Geese-men, some Spider-men, some Lice-men, some<br/>Fox-men, some Ape-men, some Jack daw-men, some Magpie-men, some<br/>Parrot-men, some Satyrs, some Gyants, and many more, which I cannot<br/>all remember; and of these several sorts of men, each followed such<br/>a profession as was most proper for the nature of their Species,<br/>which the Empress encouraged them in, especially those that had<br/>applied themselves to the study of several Arts and Sciences; for<br/>they were as ingenious and witty in the invention of profitable and<br/>useful Arts, as we are in our world, nay, more; and to that end she<br/>erected Schools, and founded several Societies. The Bear-men were<br/>to be her Experimental Philosophers, the Bird-men her Astronomers,<br/>the Fly- Worm- and Fish-men her Natural Philosophers, the Ape-men<br/>her Chymists, the Satyrs her Galenick Physicians, the Fox-men her<br/>Politicians, the Spider- and Lice-men her Mathematicians, the<br/>Jackdaw- Magpie-&#160;and Parrot-men her Orators and Logicians, the<br/>Gyants her Architects, &amp;c. But before all things, she having<br/>got a Soveraign power from the Emperor over all the World, desired<br/>to be informed both of the manner of their Religion and Government;<br/>and to that end she called the Priests and States men, to give her<br/>an account of either. Of the States men she enquired, first, Why<br/>they had so few Laws? To which they answered, That many Laws made<br/>many Divisions, which most commonly did breed Factions, and at last<br/>brake out into open Wars. Next, she asked, Why they preferred the<br/>Monarchical form of Government before any other? They answered,<br/>That as it was natural for one Body to have but one Head, so it was<br/>also natural for a Politick body to have but one Governor; and that<br/>a Common-wealth, which had many Governors was like a Monster with<br/>many Heads. Besides, said they, a Monarchy is a divine form of<br/>Government, and agrees most with our Religion: For as there is but<br/>one God, whom we all unanimously worship and adore with one Faith;<br/>so we are resolved to have but one Emperor, to whom we all submit<br/>with one obedience.<br/><br/>Then the Empress seeing that the several sorts of her Subjects<br/>had each their Churches apart, asked the Priests, whether they were<br/>of several Religions? They answered her Majesty, That there was no<br/>more but one Religion in all that World, nor no diversity<br/>of&#160;opinions in that same Religion for though there were<br/>several sorts of men, yet had they all but one opinion concerning<br/>the Worship and Adoration of God. The Empress asked them, Whether<br/>they were Jews, Turks, or Christians? We do not know, said they,<br/>what Religions those are; but we do all unanimously acknowledg,<br/>worship and adore the Onely, Omnipotent, and Eternal God, with all<br/>reverence, submission, and duty. Again, the Empress enquired,<br/>Whether they had several Forms of Worship? They answered, No: For<br/>our Devotion and Worship consists onely in Prayers, which we frame<br/>according to our several Necessities, in Petitions, Humiliations,<br/>Thanksgiving, &amp;c. Truly, replied the Empress, I thought you had<br/>been either Jews, or Turks, because I never perceived any Women in<br/>your Congregations: But what is the reason, you bar them from your<br/>religious Assemblies? It is not fit, said they, that Men and Women<br/>should be promiscuously together in time of Religious Worship; for<br/>their company hinders Devotion, and makes many, instead of praying<br/>to God, direct their Devotion to their Mistresses. But, asked the<br/>Empress, Have they no Congregation of their own, to perform the<br/>duties of Divine Worship, as well as Men? No, answered they: but<br/>they stay at home, and say their Prayers by themselves in their<br/>Closets. Then the Empress desir'd to know the reason why the<br/>Priests and Governors of their World&#160;were made Eunuchs? They<br/>answer'd, To keep them from Marriage: For Women and Children most<br/>commonly make disturbance both in Church and State. But, said she,<br/>Women and Children have no Employment in Church or State. 'Tis<br/>true, answer'd they; but, although they are not admitted to publick<br/>Employments, yet are they so prevalent with their Husbands and<br/>Parents, that many times by their importunate perswasions, they<br/>cause as much, nay, more mischief secretly, then if they had the<br/>management of publick Affairs.<br/><br/>
