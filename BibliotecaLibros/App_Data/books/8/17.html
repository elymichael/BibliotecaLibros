Hereupon a Councel was called, and the business debated; but<br/>there were so many cross and different Opinions, that they could<br/>not suddenly resolve what answer to send the Empress; at which she<br/>grew angry, insomuch that she resolved to return into her Blazing-<br/>World, without giving any assistance to her Countrymen: but the<br/>Duchess of Newcastle intreated her Majesty to abate her passion;<br/>for, said she, Great Councels are most commonly slow, because many<br/>men have many several Opinions: besides, every Councellor striving<br/>to be the wisest, makes long speeches, and raise many doubts, which<br/>cause retardments. If I had long-speeched Councellors, replied the<br/>Empress, I would hang them, by reason they give more Words, then<br/>Advice. The Duchess answered, That her Majesty should not be angry,<br/>but consider the differences of that and her Blazing-World; for,<br/>said she, they are not both alike; but there are grosser and duller<br/>understandings in this, than in the Blazing-World.<br/><br/>At last a Messenger came out, who returned the Empress thanks<br/>for her kind proffer, but desired withal, to know from whence she<br/>came, and how, and in what manner her assistance could be<br/>serviceable to them? The Empress answered, That she was not bound<br/>to tell them whence she came; but as for the manner of her<br/>assistance, I will appear, said she, to your Navy in a splendorous<br/>Light, surrounded with Fire. The Messenger asked at what time they<br/>should expect her coming? I'le be with you, answered the Empress,<br/>about one of the Clock at night. With this report the Messenger<br/>returned; which made both the poor Councellors and Sea-men much<br/>afraid; but yet they longed for the time to behold this strange<br/>sight.<br/><br/>The appointed hour being come, the Empress appear'd with<br/>Garments made of the Star-stone, and was born or supported above<br/>the Water, upon the Fish- mens heads and backs, so that she seemed<br/>to walk upon the face of the Water, and the Bird- and Fish-men<br/>carried the Fire-stone, lighted both in the Air, and above the<br/>Waters.<br/><br/>Which sight, when her Country-men perceived at a distance, their<br/>hearts began to tremble; but coming something nearer, she left her<br/>Torches, and appeared onely in her Garments of Light, like an<br/>Angel, or some Deity, and all kneeled down before her, and<br/>worshipped her with all submission and reverence: But&#160;the<br/>Empress would not come nearer than at such a distance where her<br/>voice might be generally heard, by reason she would not have that<br/>any of her Accoustrements should be perceived, but the splendor<br/>thereof; and when she was come so near that her voice could be<br/>heard and understood by all, she made this following Speech:<br/><br/>Dear Country-men, for so you are, although you know me not; I<br/>being a Native of this Kingdom, and hearing that most part of this<br/>World had resolved to make Warr against it, and sought to destroy<br/>it, at least to weaken its Naval Force and Power, have made a<br/>Voyage out of another World, to lend you my assistance against your<br/>Enemies. I come not to make bargains with you, or to regard my own<br/>Interest more than your Safety; but I intend to make you the most<br/>powerful Nation of this World, and therefore I have chosen rather<br/>to quit my own Tranquility, Riches and Pleasure, than suffer you to<br/>be ruined and destroyed. All the Return I desire, is but your<br/>grateful acknowledgment, and to declare my Power, Love and Loyalty<br/>to my Native Country: for, although I am now a Great and Absolute<br/>Princess, and Empress of a whole World, yet I acknowledg, that once<br/>I was a Subject of this Kingdom, which is but a small part of this<br/>World; and therefore I will have you undoubtedly believe, that I<br/>shall destroy all your Enemies before this following Night, I mean<br/>those which trouble you by Sea; and if you have any&#160;by Land,<br/>assure your self I shall also give you my assistance against them,<br/>and make you triumph over all that seek your Ruine and<br/>Destruction.<br/><br/>Upon this Declaration of the Empress, when both the General, and<br/>all the Commanders in their several Ships, had return'd their<br/>humble and hearty Thanks to Her Majesty for so great a favour to<br/>them, she took her leave, and departed to her own Ships. But, good<br/>Lord! what several Opinions and Judgments did this produce in the<br/>minds of her Country-men! some said she was an Angel; others, she<br/>was a sorceress; some believed her a Goddess; others said the Devil<br/>deluded them in the shape of a fine Lady.<br/><br/>The morning after, when the Navies were to fight, the Empress<br/>appear'd upon the face of the Waters, dress'd in her Imperial<br/>Robes, which were all of Diamonds and Carbuncles; in one hand she<br/>held a Buckler, made of one intire Carbuncle; and in the other hand<br/>a Spear of one intire Diamond; on her head she had a Cap of<br/>Diamonds, and just upon the top of the Crown, was a Starr made of<br/>the Starr-stone, mentioned heretofore; and a Half-Moon made of the<br/>same Stone, was placed on her forehead; all her other Garments were<br/>of several sorts of precious Jewels; and having given her Fish-men<br/>directions how to destroy the Enemies of her Native Country, she<br/>proceeded to effect her design. The Fish-men were to carry<br/>the&#160;Fire-stones in cases of Diamonds (for the Diamonds in the<br/>Blazing-World, are in splendor so far beyond the Diamonds of this<br/>World, as Peble-stones are to the best sort of this Worlds<br/>Diamonds) and to uncase or uncover those Fire-stones no sooner but<br/>when they were just under the Enemis Ships, or close at their<br/>sides, and then to wet them, and set their Ships on fire; which was<br/>no sooner done, but all the Enemie's Fleet was of a Flaming fire;<br/>and coming to the place where the Powder was, it streight blew them<br/>up; so that all the several Navies of the Enemies, were destroyed<br/>in a short time: which when her Countrymen did see, they all cried<br/>out with one voice, That she was an Angel sent from God to deliver<br/>them out of the hands of their Enemies: Neither would she return<br/>into the Blazing-World, until she had forced all the rest of the<br/>World to submit to that same Nation.<br/><br/>In the mean time, the General of all their Naval Forces, sent to<br/>their soveraign to acquaint him with their miraculous Delivery and<br/>Conquest, and with the Empress's design of making him the most<br/>powerful Monarch of all that World. After a short time, the Empress<br/>sent her self, to the soveraign of that Nation to know in what she<br/>could be serviceable to him; who returning her many thanks, both<br/>for her assistance against his Enemies, and her kind proffer to do<br/>him further service for the good and benefit of his Nations (for he<br/>was King over several Kingdoms) sent her word,&#160;that although<br/>she did partly destroy his Enemies by Sea, yet, they were so<br/>powerful, that they did hinder the Trade and Traffick of his<br/>Dominions. To which the Empress returned this answer, That she<br/>would burn and sink all those Ships that would not pay him Tribute;<br/>and forthwith sent to all the Neighbouring Nations, who had any<br/>Traffick by Sea, desiring them to pay Tribute to the King and<br/>soveraign of that Nation where she was born; But they denied it<br/>with great scorn. Whereupon, she immediately commanded her<br/>Fish-men, to destroy all strangers Ships that traffick'd on the<br/>Seas; which they did according to the Empress's Command; and when<br/>the Neighbouring Nations and Kingdoms perceived her power, they<br/>were so discomposed in their affairs and designs, that they knew<br/>not what to do: At last they sent to the Empress, and desired to<br/>treat with her, but could get no other conditions then to submit<br/>and pay Tribute to the said King and soveraign of her Native<br/>Country, otherwise, she was resolved to ruin all their Trade and<br/>Traffick by burning their Ships. Long was this Treaty, but in fine,<br/>they could obtain nothing, so that at last they were inforced to<br/>submit; by which the King of the mentioned Nations became absolute<br/>Master of the Seas, and consequently of that World; by reason, as I<br/>mentioned heretofore, the several Nations of that World could not<br/>well live without Traffick and Commerce, by Sea, as well as by<br/>Land.<br/><br/>But after a short time, those Neighbouring Nations finding<br/>themselves so much inslaved, that they were hardly able to peep out<br/>of their own Dominions without a chargeable Tribute, they all<br/>agreed to join again their Forces against the King and soveraign of<br/>the said Dominions; which when the Empress receiv'd notice of, she<br/>sent out her Fish-men to destroy, as they had done before, the<br/>remainder of all their Naval Power, by which they were soon forced<br/>again to submit, except some Nations which could live without<br/>Foreign Traffick, and some whose Trade and Traffick was meerly by<br/>Land; these would no ways be Tributary to the mentioned King. The<br/>Empress sent them word, That in case they did not submit to him,<br/>she intended to fire all their Towns and Cities, and reduce them by<br/>force, to what they would not yield with a good will. But they<br/>rejected and scorned her Majesties Message, which provoked her<br/>anger so much, that she resolved to send her Bird- and Worm men<br/>thither, with order to begin first with their smaller Towns, and<br/>set them on fire (for she was loath to make more spoil then she was<br/>forced to do) and if they remain'd still obstinate in their<br/>resolutions, to destroy also their greater Cities. The onely<br/>difficulty was, how to convey the Worm-men conveniently to those<br/>places; but they desired that her Majesty would but set them upon<br/>any part of the Earth of those Nations,&#160;and they could travel<br/>within the Earth as easily, and as nimbly as men upon the face of<br/>the Earth; which the Empress did according to their desire.<br/><br/>But before both the Bird- and Worm-men began their journey, the<br/>Empress commanded the Bearmen to view through their Telescopes what<br/>Towns and Cities those were that would not submit; and having a<br/>full information thereof, she instructed the Bird- and Bear-men<br/>what Towns they should begin withal; in the mean while she sent to<br/>all the Princes and soveraigns of those Nations, to let them know<br/>that she would give them a proof of her Power, and check their<br/>Obstinacies by burning some of their smaller Towns; and if they<br/>continued still in their Obstinate Resolutions, that she would<br/>convert their smaller Loss into a Total Ruin. she also commanded<br/>her Bird-men to make their flight at night, lest they be perceived.<br/>At last when both the Bird- and Worm-men came to the designed<br/>places, the Worm-men laid some Fire-stones under the Foundation of<br/>every House, and the Bird-men placed some at the tops of them, so<br/>that both by rain, and by some other moisture within the Earth, the<br/>stones could not fail of burning. The Bird-men in the mean time<br/>having learned some few words of their Language, told them, That<br/>the next time it did rain, their Towns would be all on fire; at<br/>which they were amaz'd to hear Men speak in the air;<br/>but&#160;withall they laughed when they heard them say that rain<br/>should fire their Towns; knowing that the effect of Water was to<br/>quench, not produce Fire.<br/><br/>At last a rain came, and upon a sudden all their Houses appeared<br/>of a flaming Fire; and the more Water there was poured on them, the<br/>more they did flame and burn; which struck such a Fright and Terror<br/>into all the Neighbouring Cities, Nations and Kingdoms, that for<br/>fear the like should happen to them, they and all the rest of the<br/>parts of that World, granted the Empress's desire, and submitted to<br/>the Monarch and sovereign of her Native Countrey, the King of Esfi;<br/>save one, which having seldom or never any rain, but onely dews,<br/>which would soon be spent in a great fire, slighted her Power: The<br/>Empress being desirous to make it stoop as well as the rest, knew<br/>that every year it was watered by a flowing Tide, which lasted some<br/>Weeks; and although their Houses stood high from the ground, yet<br/>they were built upon Supporters which were fixt into the ground.<br/>Wherefore she commanded both her Bird- and Worm-men to lay some of<br/>the Fire-stones at the bottom of those Supporters, and when the<br/>Tide came in, all their Houses were of a Fire, which did so rarifie<br/>the Water, that the Tide was soon turn'd into a Vapour, and this<br/>Vapour again into Air; which caused not onely a destruction of<br/>their Houses, but also a general barrenness&#160;over all their<br/>Countrey that year, and forced them to submit, as well as the rest<br/>of the World had done.<br/>
