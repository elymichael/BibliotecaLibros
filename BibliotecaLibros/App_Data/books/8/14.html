<br/>Noble Friends, I think it fit, by your leave, to answer Lady<br/>Fortune in the behalf of my Noble Lord and Husband, since he is not<br/>here himself; and since you have heard her complaint concerning the<br/>choice my Lord made of his Friends, and the neglect and disrespect<br/>he seemed to cast upon her; give me leave to answer, that, first<br/>concerning the Choice of his Friends, He has proved himself a wise<br/>man in it; and as for the disrespect and rudeness her Ladiship<br/>accuses him of, I dare say he is so much a Gentleman, that I am<br/>confident he would never slight, scorn or disrespect&#160;any of<br/>the Female Sex in all his life time; but was such a servant and<br/>Champion for them, that he ventured Life and Estate in their<br/>service; but being of an honest, as well as an honourable Nature,<br/>he could not trust Fortune with that which he preferred above his<br/>life, which was his Reputation, by reason Fortune did not side with<br/>those that were honest and honourable, but renounced them; and<br/>since he could not be of both sides, he chose to be of that which<br/>was agreeable both to his Conscience, Nature and Education; for<br/>which choice Fortune did not onely declare her self his open Enemy,<br/>but fought with him in several Battels; nay, many times, hand to<br/>hand; at last, she being a Powerful Princess, and as some believe,<br/>a Deity, overcame him, and cast him into a Banishment, where she<br/>kept him in great misery, ruined his Estate, and took away from him<br/>most of his Friends; nay, even when she favoured many that were<br/>against her, she still frowned on him; all which he endured with<br/>the greatest patience, and with that respect to Lady Fortune, that<br/>he did never in the least endeavour to disoblige any of her<br/>Favourites, but was onely sorry that he, an honest man, could find<br/>no favor in her Court; and since he did never injure any of those<br/>she favoured, he neither was an enemy to her Ladiship, but gave her<br/>always that respect and worship which belonged to her power and<br/>dignity, and is still ready at any time honestly and prudently to<br/>serve her; he onely begs, her Ladiship would be his friend for the<br/>future, as she hath been his enemy in times past.<br/><br/>As soon as the Duchess's Speech was ended, Folly and Rashness<br/>started up, and both spake so thick and fast at once, that not<br/>onely the Assembly, but themselves were not able to understand each<br/>other: At which Fortune was somewhat out of countenance; and<br/>commanded them either to speak singly, or be silent: But Prudence<br/>told her Ladiship, she should command them to speak wisely, as well<br/>as singly; otherwise, said she, it were best for them not to speak<br/>at all: Which Fortune resented very ill, and told Prudence, she was<br/>too bold; and then commanded Folly to declare what she would have<br/>made known: but her Speech was so foolish, mixt with such<br/>Non-sense, that none knew what to make of it; besides, it was so<br/>tedious, that Fortune bid her to be silent; and commanded Rashness<br/>to speak for her, who began after this manner:<br/><br/>Great Fortune; The Duchess of Newcastle has proved her self,<br/>according to report, a very Proud and Ambitious Lady, in presuming<br/>to answer you her own self, in this noble Assembly without your<br/>Command, in a Speech wherein she did not onely contradict you, but<br/>preferred Honesty and Prudence before you; saying, That her Lord<br/>was ready to serve you honestly and prudently; which presumption is<br/>beyond all pardon; and if you allow Honesty and Prudence to be<br/>above you, none will admire, worship, or serve you; but you'l be<br/>forced to serve your self, and will be despised, neglected and<br/>scorned by all; and from a Deity, become a miserable, dirty,<br/>begging mortal in a&#160;Church-yard-Porch, or Noble-man's Gate:<br/>Wherefore to prevent such disasters, fling as many misfortunes and<br/>neglects on the Duke and Duchess of Newcastle, and their two<br/>friends, as your power is able to do; otherwise Prudence and<br/>Honesty will be the chief and onely Moral Deities of Mortals.<br/><br/>Rashness having thus ended her Speech, Prudence rose and<br/>declared her self in this manner:<br/><br/>Beautiful Truth, Great Fortune, and you the rest of my noble<br/>Friends; I am come a great and long journey in the behalf of my<br/>dear Friend the Duke of Newcastle; not to make more wounds, but, if<br/>it be possible, to heal those that are made already. Neither do I<br/>presume to be a Deity; but my onely request is, that you would be<br/>pleased to accept of my Offering, I being an humble and devout<br/>supplicant; and since no offering is more acceptable to the Gods,<br/>then the offering of Peace; in order to that, I desire to make an<br/>agreement between Fortune, and the Duke of Newcastle.<br/><br/>Thus she spake, and as she was going up, up started Honesty (for<br/>she has not always so much discretion as she ought to have) and<br/>interrupted Prudence.<br/><br/>I came not here, said she, to hear Fortune flattered, but to<br/>hear the Cause decided between Fortune and the Duke; neither came I<br/>hither to speak Rhetorically and Eloquently, but to propound the<br/>case plainly and truly; and I'le have you know, that the Duke,<br/>whose Cause we argue, was and is my Foster-son; for I Honesty bred<br/>him from his&#160;Childhood, and made a perpetual friendship<br/>betwixt him and Gratitude, Charity and Generosity; and put him to<br/>School to Prudence, who taught him Wisdom, and informed him in the<br/>Rules of Temperance, Patience, Justice, and the like; then I put<br/>him into the University of Honour, where he learned all Honourable<br/>Qualities, Arts, and Sciences; afterward I sent him to travel<br/>through the World of Actions, and made Observation his Governor;<br/>and in those his travels, he contracted a friendship with<br/>Experience; all which, made him fit for Heavens Blessings, and<br/>Fortunes Favours: But she hating all those that have merit and<br/>desert, became his inveterate Enemy, doing him all the mischief she<br/>could, until the God of Justice opposed Fortune's Malice, and<br/>pull'd him out of those ruines she had cast upon him: For this<br/>God's Favourites were the Dukes Champions; wherefore to be an Enemy<br/>to him, were to be an Enemy to the God of Justice: In short, the<br/>true cause of Fortunes Malice to this Duke is, that he would never<br/>flatter her; for I Honesty, did command him not to do it, or else<br/>he would be forced to follow all her inconstant ways, and obey all<br/>her unjust commands, which would cause a great reproach to him:<br/>but, on the other side, Prudence advised him not to despise<br/>Fortune's favours, for that would be an obstrustion and hinderance<br/>to his worth and merit; and He to obey both our advice and<br/>counsels, did neither flatter nor despise Her; but was always<br/>humble and respectful to her so far as Honour, Honesty and<br/>Conscience would permit: all which I refer to Truth's Judgment, and<br/>expect her final Sentence.<br/><br/>Fortune hearing thus Honesty's plain Speech, thought it very<br/>rude, and would not hearken to Truth's Judgment, but went away in a<br/>Passion: At which, both the Empress and Duchess were extreamly<br/>troubled, that their endeavours should have no better effect: but<br/>Honesty chid the Duchess, and said, she was to be punished for<br/>desiring so much Fortune's favours; for it appears, said she, that<br/>you mistrust the gods blessings: At which the Duchess wept,<br/>answering Honesty, That she did neither mistrust the gods<br/>blessings, nor relye upon Fortune's favours; but desired onely that<br/>her Lord might have no potent Enemies. The Empress being much<br/>troubled to see her weep, told Honesty in anger, she wanted the<br/>discretion of Prudence; for though you are commended, said she, yet<br/>you are apt to commit many indiscreet actions, unless Prudence be<br/>your guide. At which reproof Prudence smiled, and Honesty was<br/>somewhat out of countenance; but they soon became very good<br/>friends: and after the Duchess's Soul had stayed some time with the<br/>Empress in the Blazing-World, she begg'd leave of her to return to<br/>her Lord and Husband; which the Empress granted her, upon condition<br/>she should come and visit her as often as conveniently she could,<br/>promising that she would do the same to the Duchess.<br/><br/>Thus the Duchess's soul, after she had taken her leave of the<br/>Empress, as also of the Spirits, who with great civility, promised<br/>her, that they would endeavour&#160;in time to make a Peace and<br/>Agreement between Fortune and the Duke, returned with Prudence and<br/>Honesty, into her own World: But when she was just upon her<br/>departure, the Empress sent to Her, and desired that she might yet<br/>have some little conference with her before she went; which the<br/>Duchess most willingly granted her Majesty; and when she came to<br/>wait on her, the Empress told the Duchess, That she being her dear<br/>Platonick Friend, of whose just and Impartial Judgment, she had<br/>alwayes a very great esteem; could not forbear, before she went<br/>from her, to ask her Advice concerning the Government of the<br/>Blazing-world: For, said she, although this World was very well and<br/>wisely ordered and governed at first, when I came to be Empress<br/>thereof; yet the nature of Women being much delighted with Change<br/>and Variety, after I had received an absolute Power from the<br/>Emperor, did somewhat alter the Form of Government from what I<br/>found it; but now perceiving that the World is not so quiet as it<br/>was at first, I am much troubled at it; especially there are such<br/>continual Contentions and Divisions between the Worm- Bear- and<br/>Fly-men, the Ape-men, the Satyrs, the Spider-men, and all others of<br/>such sorts, that I fear they'l break out into an open Rebellion,<br/>and cause a great disorder; and the ruin of the Government; and<br/>therefore I desire your advice and assistance, how I may order it<br/>to the best advantage, that this World may be&#160;rendred<br/>peaceable, quiet and happy, as it was before. Whereupon the Duchess<br/>answered, That since she heard by her Imperial Majesty, how well<br/>and happily the World had been governed when she first came to be<br/>Empress thereof, she would advise her Majesty to introduce the same<br/>form of Government again, which had been before; that is, to have<br/>but one soveraign, one Religion, one Law, and one Language, so that<br/>all the World might be but as one united Family, without divisions;<br/>nay, like God, and his Blessed Saints and Angels: Otherwise, said<br/>she, it may in time prove as unhappy, nay, as miserable a World as<br/>that is from which I came, wherein are more soveraigns then Worlds,<br/>and more pretended Governours then Government, more Religions then<br/>Gods, and more Opinions in those Religions then Truths; more Laws<br/>then Rights, and more Bribes then Justices; more Policies then<br/>Necessities, and more Fears then Dangers; more Covetousness then<br/>Riches, more Ambitions then Merits, more Services then Rewards,<br/>more Languages then Wit, more Controversie then Knowledg, more<br/>Reports then noble Actions, and more Gifts by partiality, then<br/>according to Merit; all which, said she, is a great misery, nay, a<br/>curse, which your blessed Blazing-World never knew, nor 'tis<br/>probable, will never know of, unless your Imperial Majesty alter<br/>the Government thereof from what it was when you began to govern<br/>it: And since your Majesty complains much of&#160;the factions of<br/>the Bear- Fish- Fly- Ape- and Worm- men, the Satyrs, Spider-men,<br/>and the like, and of their perpetual disputes and quarrels, I would<br/>advise your Majesty to dissolve all their societies; for 'tis<br/>better to be without their intelligences, then to have an unquiet<br/>and disorderly Government. The truth is, said she, wheresoever<br/>Learning is, there is most commonly also Controversie and<br/>quarelling; for there be always some that will know more, and be<br/>wiser then others: some think their Arguments come nearer to Truth,<br/>and are more rational then others; some are so wedded to their own<br/>opinions, that they'l never yield to Reason; and others, though<br/>they find their Opinions not firmly grounded upon Reason, yet, for<br/>fear of receiving some disgrace by altering them, will nevertheless<br/>maintain them against all sense and reason, which must needs breed<br/>factions in their Schools, which at last break out into open Wars,<br/>and draw sometimes an utter ruin upon a State or Government. The<br/>Empress told the Duchess, that she would willingly follow her<br/>advice; but she thought it would be an eternal disgrace to her, to<br/>alter her own Decrees, Acts, and Laws. To which the Duchess<br/>answered, That it was so far from a disgrace, as it would rather be<br/>for her Majesties eternal honour, to return from a worse to a<br/>better, and would express and declare Her to be more then ordinary<br/>wise and good; so wise, as to perceive her own errors, and so good,<br/>as not to persist in them, which few did: for&#160;which, said she,<br/>you will get a glorious fame in this World, and an Eternal Glory<br/>hereafter; and I shall pray for it so long as I live. Upon which<br/>Advice, the Empress's Soul embrac'd and kiss'd the Duchess's Soul<br/>with an Immaterial Kiss, and shed Immaterial Tears, that she was<br/>forced to part from her, finding her not a flattering Parasite, but<br/>a true Friend; and in truth, such was their Platonick Friendship,<br/>as these two loving Souls did often meet and rejoice in each others<br/>Conversation.<br/><br/><br/><br/>
