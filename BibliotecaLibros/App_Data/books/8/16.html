<br/><br/><br/>The Second Part of the Description of the<br/>New Blazing-World.<br/><br/><br/>The Empress having now ordered and setled her Government to the<br/>best advantage and quiet of her Blazing-World, lived and reigned<br/>most happily and blessedly, and received oftentimes Visits from the<br/>Immaterial Spirits, who gave her Intelligence of all such things as<br/>she desired to know, and they were able to inform her of: One time<br/>they told her, how the World she came from, was imbroiled in a<br/>great War, and that most parts or Nations thereof made War against<br/>that Kingdom which was her Native Country,&#160;where all her<br/>Friends and Relations did live; at which the Empress was extreamly<br/>troubled; insomuch that the Emperor perceived her grief by her<br/>tears, and examining the cause thereof, she told him that she had<br/>received Intelligence from the Spirits, that that part of the World<br/>she came from, which was her native Country, was like to be<br/>destroyed by numerous Enemies that made War against it. The Emperor<br/>being very sensible of this ill news, especially of the Trouble it<br/>caused to the Empress, endeavoured to comfort her as much as<br/>possibly he could; and told her, that she might have all the<br/>assistance which the Blazing-World was able to afford. she<br/>answered, That if there were any possibility of transporting Forces<br/>out of the Blazing-World, into the World she came from, she would<br/>not fear so much the ruin thereof: but, said she, there being no<br/>probability of effecting anysuch thing, I know not how to shew my<br/>readiness to serve my Native Country. The Emperor asked, Whether<br/>those Spirits that gave her Intelligence of this War, could not<br/>with all their Power and Forces, assist her against those Enemies?<br/>she answered, That Spirits could not arm themselves, nor make any<br/>use of Artificial Arms or Weapons; for their Vehicles were Natural<br/>Bodies, not Artificial: Besides, said she, the violent and strong<br/>actions of war, will never agree with Immaterial Spirits; for<br/>Immaterial Spirits cannot fight, nor make Trenches, Fortifications,<br/>and the like. But, said the Emperor, their Vehicles<br/>can;&#160;especially if those Vehicles be mens Bodies, they may be<br/>serviceable in all the actions of War. Alas, replied the Empress,<br/>that will never do; for first, said she, it will be difficult to<br/>get so many dead Bodies for their Vehicles, as to make up a whole<br/>Army, much more to make many Armies to fight with so many several<br/>Nations; nay, if this could be, yet it is not possible to get so<br/>many dead and undissolved Bodies in one Nation; and for<br/>transporting them out of other Nations, it would be a thing of<br/>great difficulty and improbability: But put the case, said she, all<br/>these difficulties could be overcome; yet there is one obstruction<br/>or hindrance which can no ways be avoided: For although those dead<br/>and undissolved Bodies did all die in one minute of time; yet<br/>before they could Rendezvouze, and be put into a posture of War, to<br/>make a great and formidable Army, they would stink and dissolve;<br/>and when they came to a fight, they would moulder into dust and<br/>ashes, and so leave the purer Immaterial Spirits naked: nay, were<br/>it also possible, that those dead bodies could be preserved from<br/>stinking and dissolving, yet the Souls of such Bodies would not<br/>suffer Immaterial Spirits to rule and order them, but they would<br/>enter and govern them themselves, as being the right owners<br/>thereof, which would produce a War between those Immaterial Souls,<br/>and the Immaterial Spirits in Material Bodies; all which would<br/>hinder them from doing any service in the actions of War, against<br/>the Enemies&#160;of my Native Countrey. You speak Reason, said the<br/>Emperor, and I wish with all my Soul I could advise any manner or<br/>way, that you might be able to assist it; but you having told me of<br/>your dear Platonick Friend the Duchess of Newcastle and of her good<br/>and profitable Counsels, I would desire you to send for her Soul,<br/>and conferr with her about this business.<br/><br/>The Empress was very glad of this motion of the Emperor, and<br/>immediately sent for the Soul of the said Duchess, which in a<br/>minute waited on her Majesty. Then the Empress declared to her the<br/>grievance and sadness of her mind, and how much she was troubled<br/>and afflicted at the News brought her by the Immaterial Spirits,<br/>desiring the Duchess, if possible, to assist her with the best<br/>Counsels she could, that she might shew the greatness of her love<br/>and affection which she bore to her Native Countrey. Whereupon the<br/>Duchess promised her Majesty to do what lay in her power; and since<br/>it was a business of great Importance, she desired some time to<br/>consider of it; for, said she, Great Affairs require deep<br/>Considerations; which the Empress willingly allowed her. And after<br/>the Duchess had considered some little time, she desired the<br/>Empress to send some of her Syrens or Mear men, to see what<br/>passages they could find out of the Blazing-World, into the World<br/>she came from; for, said she, if there be&#160;a passage for a Ship<br/>to come out of that World into this; then certainly there may also<br/>a Ship pass thorow the same passage out of this World into that.<br/>Hereupon the Mear- or Fish-men were sent out; who being many in<br/>number, employ'd all their industry, and did swim several ways; at<br/>last having found out the passage, they returned to the Empress,<br/>and told her, That as their Blazing World had but one Emperor, one<br/>Government, one Religion, and one Language, so there was but one<br/>Passage into that World, which was so little, that no Vessel bigger<br/>than a Packet-Boat could go thorow; neither was that Passage always<br/>open, but sometimes quite frozen up. At which Relation both the<br/>Empress and Duchess seemed somewhat troubled, fearing that this<br/>would perhaps be an hindrance or obstruction to their Design.<br/><br/>At last the Duchess desired the Empress to send for her<br/>Ship-wrights, and all her Architects, which were Giants; who being<br/>called, the Duchess told them how some in her own World had been so<br/>ingenious, as to contrive Ships that could swim under Water, and<br/>asked, Whether they could do the like? The Giants answered, They<br/>had never heard of that Invention; nevertheless, they would try<br/>what might be done by Art, and spare no labour or industry to find<br/>it out. In the mean time, while both the Empress and Duchess were<br/>in a serious Counsel,&#160;after many debates, the Duchess desired<br/>but a few Ships to transport some of the Bird- Worm- and Bear- men:<br/>Alas! said the Empress, What can such sorts of Men do in the other<br/>World? especially so few? They will be soon destroyed, for a Musket<br/>will destroy numbers of Birds in one shot. The Duchess said, I<br/>desire your Majesty will have but a little patience, and relie upon<br/>my advice, and you shall not fail to save your own Native Country,<br/>and in a manner become a Mistress of all that World you came from.<br/>The Empress, who loved the Duchess as her own Soul, did so; the<br/>Giants returned soon after, and told her Majesty, that they had<br/>found out the Art which the Duchess had mentioned, to make such<br/>Ships as could swim under water; which the Empress and Duchess were<br/>both very glad at, and when the Ships were made ready, the Duchess<br/>told the Empress, that it was requisite that her Majesty should go<br/>her self in body, as well as in Soul; but I, said she, can onely<br/>wait on your Majesty after a Spiritual manner, that is, with my<br/>Soul. Your Soul, said the Empress, shall live with my Soul, in my<br/>Body; for I shall onely desire your Counsel and Advice. Then said<br/>the Duchess, Your Majesty must command a great number of your<br/>Fish-men to wait on your Ships; for you know that your Ships are<br/>not made for Cannons, and therefore are no ways serviceable in War;<br/>for though by the help of your Engines, they can drive on, and your<br/>Fish-men may by the&#160;help of Chains and Ropes, draw them which<br/>way they will, to make them go on, or flye back, yet not so as to<br/>fight: And though your Ships be of Gold, and cannot be shot thorow,<br/>but onely bruised and battered; yet the Enemy will assault and<br/>enter them, and take them as Prizes; wherefore your Fishmen must do<br/>you Service instead of Cannons. But how, said the Empress, can the<br/>Fish-men do me service against an Enemy, without Cannons and all<br/>sorts of Arms? That is the reason, answered the Duchess, that I<br/>would have numbers of Fish-men, for they shall destroy all your<br/>Enemies Ships, before they can come near you. The Empress asked in<br/>what manner that could be? Thus, answered the Duchess: Your Majesty<br/>must send a number of Worm-men to the Burning-Mountains (for you<br/>have good store of them in the Blazing-World) which must get a<br/>great quantity of the Fire-stone, whose property, you know, is,<br/>that it burns so long as it is wet; and the Ships in the other<br/>World being all made of Wood, they may by that means set them all<br/>on fire; and if you can but destroy their Ships, and hinder their<br/>Navigation, you will be Mistress of all that World, by reason most<br/>parts thereof cannot live without Navigation. Besides, said she,<br/>the Fire-stone will serve you instead of Light or Torches; for you<br/>know, that the World you are going into, is dark at nights<br/>(especially if there be no&#160;Moon-shine, or if the Moon be<br/>overshadowed by Clouds) and not so full of Blazing-Stars as this<br/>World is, which make as great a light in the absence of the Sun, as<br/>the Sun doth when it is present; for that World hath but little<br/>blinking Stars, which make more shadows then light, and are onely<br/>able to draw up Vapours from the Earth, but not to rarifie or<br/>clarifie them, or to convert them into serene air.<br/><br/>This Advice of the Duchess was very much approved; and joyfully<br/>embraced by the Empress, who forthwith sent her Worm-men to get a<br/>good quantity of the mentioned Fire-stone. she also commanded<br/>numbers of Fish-men to wait on her under Water, and Bird-men to<br/>wait on her in the Air; and Bear- and Worm-men to wait on her in<br/>Ships, according to the Duchess's advice; and indeed the Bear-men<br/>were as serviceable to her, as the North Star; but the Bird-men<br/>would often rest themselves upon the Deck of the Ships; neither<br/>would the Empress, being of a sweet and noble Nature, suffer that<br/>they should tire or weary themselves by long flights; for though by<br/>Land they did often fly out of one Countrey into another, yet they<br/>did rest in some Woods, or on some Grounds, especially at night,<br/>when it was their sleeping time: And therefore the Empress was<br/>forced to take a great many Ships along with her, both for<br/>transporting those several sorts of her loyal&#160;and serviceable<br/>Subjects, and to carry provisions for them: Besides, she was so<br/>wearied with the Petitions of several others of her Subjects who<br/>desired to wait on her Majesty, that she could not possibly deny<br/>them all; for some would rather chuse to be drowned, then not<br/>tender their duty to her.<br/><br/>Thus after all things were made fit and ready, the Empress began<br/>her Journey; I cannot properly say, she set Sail, by reason in some<br/>Part, as in the passage between the two Worlds (which yet was but<br/>short) the Ships were drawn under water by the Fish-men with Golden<br/>Chains, so that they had no need of Sails there, nor of any other<br/>Arts, but onely to keep out water from entering into the Ships, and<br/>to give or make so much Air as would serve, for breath or<br/>respiration, those Land-Animals that were in the Ships; which the<br/>Giants had so Artificially contrived, that they which were therein,<br/>found no inconveniency at all: And after they had passed the Icy<br/>Sea, the Golden Ships appeared above Water, and so went on until<br/>they came near the Kingdom that was the Empress's Native Countrey;<br/>where the Bear-men through their Telescopes discovered a great<br/>number of Ships which had beset all that Kingdom, well rigg'd and<br/>mann'd.<br/><br/>The Empress before she came in sight of the Enemy, sent some of<br/>her Fish- and Bird-men to bring her intelligence of their Fleet;<br/>and hearing of their&#160;number, their station and posture, she<br/>gave order that when it was Night, her Bird-men should carry in<br/>their beeks some of the mentioned Fire-stones, with the tops<br/>thereof wetted; and the Fish-men should carry them likewise, and<br/>hold them out of the Water; for they were cut in the form of<br/>Torches or Candles, and being many thousands, made a terrible shew;<br/>for it appear'd as if all the Air and Sea had been of a<br/>Flaming-Fire; and all that were upon the Sea, or near it, did<br/>verily believe, the time of Judgment, or the Last Day was come,<br/>which made them all fall down, and Pray.<br/><br/>At the break of Day, the Empress commanded those Lights to be<br/>put out, and then the Naval Forces of the Enemy perceived nothing<br/>but a Number of Ships without Sails, Guns, Arms, and other<br/>Instruments of War; which Ships seemed to swim of themselves,<br/>without any help or assistance: which sight put them into a great<br/>amaze; neither could they perceive that those Ships were of Gold,<br/>by reason the Empress had caused them all to be coloured black, or<br/>with a dark colour; so that the natural colour of the Gold could<br/>not be perceived through the artificial colour of the paint, no not<br/>by the best Telescopes. All which put the Enemies Fleet into such a<br/>fright at night, and to such wonder in the morning, or at day-time,<br/>that they know not what to judg or make of them; for they know<br/>neither what&#160;Ships they were, nor what Party they belonged to,<br/>insomuch that they had no power to stir.<br/><br/>In the mean while, the Empress knowing the Colours of her own<br/>Country, sent a Letter to their General, and the rest of the chief<br/>Commanders, to let them know, that she was a great and powerful<br/>Princess, and came to assist them against their Enemies: wherefore<br/>she desired they should declare themselves, when they would have<br/>her help and assistance.<br/><br/>
