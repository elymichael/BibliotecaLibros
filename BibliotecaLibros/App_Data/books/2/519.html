"What more is there to tell! I lay there and I thought I heard<br/>the master shout. And before that Grigory Vassilyevitch had<br/>suddenly got up and came out, and he suddenly gave a scream, and<br/>then all was silence and darkness. I lay there waiting, my heart<br/>beating; I couldn't bear it. I got up at last, went out. I saw the<br/>window open on the left into the garden, and I stepped to the left<br/>to listen whether he was sitting there alive, and I heard the<br/>master moving about, sighing, so I knew he was alive. 'Ech!' I<br/>thought. I went to the window and shouted to the master, 'It's I.'<br/>And he shouted to me, 'He's been, he's been; he's run away.' He<br/>meant Dmitri Fyodorovitch had been. 'He's killed Grigory! "Where?'<br/>I whispered. 'There, in the corner,' he pointed. He was whispering,<br/>too. 'Wait a bit," I said. I went to the corner of the garden to<br/>look, and there I came upon Grigory Vassilyevitch lying by the<br/>wall, covered with blood, senseless. So it's true that Dmitri<br/>Fyodorovitch has been here, was the thought that came into my head,<br/>and I determined on the spot to make an end of it, as Grigory<br/>Vassilyevitch, even if he were alive, would see nothing of it, as<br/>he lay there senseless. The only risk was that Marfa Ignatyevna<br/>might wake up. I felt that at the moment, but the longing to get it<br/>done came over me, till I could scarcely breathe. I went back to<br/>the window to the master and said, 'She's here, she's come;<br/>Agrafena Alexandrovna has come, wants to be let in.' And he started<br/>like a baby. 'Where is she?' he fairly gasped, but couldn't believe<br/>it. 'She's standing there,' said I. 'Open.' He looked out of the<br/>window at me, half believing and half distrustful, but afraid to<br/>open. 'Why, he is afraid of me now,' I thought. And it was funny. I<br/>bethought me to knock on the window-frame those taps we'd agreed<br/>upon as a signal that Grushenka had come, in his presence, before<br/>his eyes. He didn't seem to believe my word, but as soon as he<br/>heard the taps, he ran at once to open the door. He opened it. I<br/>would have gone in, but he stood in the way to prevent me passing.<br/>'Where is she? Where is she?' He looked at me, all of a tremble.<br/>'Well,' thought I, 'if he's so frightened of me as all that, it's a<br/>bad lookout!' And my legs went weak with fright that he wouldn't<br/>let me in or would call out, or Marfa Ignatyevna would run up, or<br/>something else might happen. I don't remember now, but I must have<br/>stood pale, facing him. I whispered to him, 'Why, she's there,<br/>there, under the window; how is it you don't see her?' I said.<br/>'Bring her then, bring her.' 'She's afraid,' said I; 'she was<br/>frightened at the noise, she's hidden in the bushes; go and call to<br/>her yourself from the study.' He ran to the window, put the candle<br/>in the window. 'Grushenka,' he cried, 'Grushenka, are you here?'<br/>Though he cried that, he didn't want to lean out of the window, he<br/>didn't want to move away from me, for he was panic-stricken; he was<br/>so frightened he didn't dare to turn his back on me. 'Why, here she<br/>is,' said I. I went up to the window and leaned right out of it.<br/>'Here she is; she's in the bush, laughing at you, don't you see<br/>her?' He suddenly believed it; he was all of a shake- he was<br/>awfully crazy about her- and he leaned right out of the window. I<br/>snatched up that iron paper-weight from his table; do you remember,<br/>weighing about three pounds? I swung it and hit him on the top of<br/>the skull with the corner of it. He didn't even cry out. He only<br/>sank down suddenly, and I hit him again and a third time. And the<br/>third time I knew I'd broken his skull. He suddenly rolled on his<br/>back, face upwards, covered with blood. I looked round. There was<br/>no blood on me, not a spot. I wiped the paper-weight, put it back,<br/>went up to the ikons, took the money out of the envelope, and flung<br/>the envelope on the floor and the pink ribbon beside it. I went out<br/>into the garden all of a tremble, straight to the apple-tree with a<br/>hollow in it- you know that hollow. I'd marked it long before and<br/>put a rag and a piece of paper ready in it. I wrapped all the notes<br/>in the rag and stuffed it deep down in the hole. And there it<br/>stayed for over a fortnight. I took it out later, when I came out<br/>of the hospital. I went back to my bed, lay down and thought, 'If<br/>Grigory Vassilyevitch has been killed outright it may be a bad job<br/>for me, but if he is not killed and recovers, it will be<br/>first-rate, for then he'll bear witness that Dmitri Fyodorovitch<br/>has been here, and so he must have killed him and taken the money.'<br/>Then I began groaning with suspense and impatience, so as to wake<br/>Marfa Ignatyevna as soon as possible. At last she got up and she<br/>rushed to me, but when she saw Grigory Vassilyevitch was not there,<br/>she ran out, and I heard her scream in the garden. And that set it<br/>all going and set my mind at rest."<br/><br/>He stopped. Ivan had listened all the time in dead silence<br/>without stirring or taking his eyes off him. As he told his story<br/>Smerdyakov glanced at him from time to time, but for the most part<br/>kept his eyes averted. When he had finished he was evidently<br/>agitated and was breathing hard. The perspiration stood out on his<br/>face. But it was impossible to tell whether it was remorse he was<br/>feeling, or what.<br/><br/>"Stay," cried Ivan pondering. "What about the door? If he only<br/>opened the door to you, how could Grigory have seen it open before?<br/>For Grigory saw it before you went."<br/><br/>It was remarkable that Ivan spoke quite amicably, in a different<br/>tone, not angry as before, so if anyone had opened the door at that<br/>moment and peeped in at them, he would certainly have concluded<br/>that they were talking peaceably about some ordinary, though<br/>interesting, subject.<br/><br/>"As for that door and having seen it open, that's only his<br/>fancy," said Smerdyakov, with a wry smile. "He is not a man, I<br/>assure you, but an obstinate mule. He didn't see it, but fancied he<br/>had seen it, and there's no shaking him. It's just our luck he took<br/>that notion into his head, for they can't fail to convict Dmitri<br/>Fyodorovitch after that."<br/><br/>"Listen… " said Ivan, beginning to seem bewildered again and<br/>making an effort to grasp something. "Listen. There are a lot of<br/>questions I want to ask you, but I forget them… I keep forgetting<br/>and getting mixed up. Yes. Tell me this at least, why did you open<br/>the envelope and leave it there on the floor? Why didn't you simply<br/>carry off the envelope?… When you were telling me, I thought you<br/>spoke about it as though it were the right thing to do… but why, I<br/>can't understand… "<br/><br/>"I did that for a good reason. For if a man had known all about<br/>it, as I did for instance, if he'd seen those notes before, and<br/>perhaps had put them in that envelope himself, and had seen the<br/>envelope sealed up and addressed, with his own eyes, if such a man<br/>had done the murder, what should have made him tear open the<br/>envelope afterwards, especially in such desperate haste, since he'd<br/>know for certain the notes must be in the envelope? No, if the<br/>robber had been someone like me, he'd simply have put the envelope<br/>straight in his pocket and got away with it as fast as he could.<br/>But it'd be quite different with Dmitri Fyodorovitch. He only knew<br/>about the envelope by hearsay; he had never seen it, and if he'd<br/>found it, for instance, under the mattress, he'd have torn it open<br/>as quickly as possible to make sure the notes were in it. And he'd<br/>have thrown the envelope down, without having time to think that it<br/>would be evidence against him. Because he was not an habitual thief<br/>and had never directly stolen anything before, for he is a<br/>gentleman born, and if he did bring himself to steal, it would not<br/>be regular stealing, but simply taking what was his own, for he'd<br/>told the whole town he meant to before, and had even bragged aloud<br/>before everyone that he'd go and take his property from Fyodor<br/>Pavlovitch. I didn't say that openly to the prosecutor when I was<br/>being examined, but quite the contrary, I brought him to it by a<br/>hint, as though I didn't see it myself, and as though he'd thought<br/>of it himself and I hadn't prompted him; so that Mr. Prosecutor's<br/>mouth positively watered at my suggestion."<br/><br/>"But can you possibly have thought of all that on the spot?"<br/>cried Ivan, overcome with astonishment. He looked at Smerdyakov<br/>again with alarm.<br/><br/>"Mercy on us! Could anyone think of it all in such a desperate<br/>hurry? It was all thought out beforehand."<br/><br/>"Well… well, it was the devil helped you!" Ivan cried again.<br/>"No, you are not a fool, you are far cleverer than I thought… "<br/><br/>He got up, obviously intending to walk across the room. He was<br/>in terrible distress. But as the table blocked his way, and there<br/>was hardly room to pass between the table and the wall, he only<br/>turned round where he stood and sat down again. Perhaps the<br/>impossibility of moving irritated him, as he suddenly cried out<br/>almost as furiously as before.<br/>
