You're the servant there?"<br/><br/>"Just so, sir, I was only running out to Prohoritch'sâ€¦ But I<br/>don't know you now."<br/><br/>"Tell me, my good woman, is Agrafena Alexandrovna there now?"<br/>said Mitya, beside himself with suspense. "I saw her to the house<br/>some time ago."<br/><br/>"She has been there, sir. She stayed a little while, and went<br/>off again."<br/><br/>"What? Went away?" cried Mitya. "When did she go?"<br/><br/>"Why, as soon as she came. She only stayed a minute. She only<br/>told Kuzma Kuzmitch a tale that made him laugh, and then she ran<br/>away."<br/><br/>"You're lying, damn you!" roared Mitya.<br/><br/>"Aie! Aie!" shrieked the old woman, but Mitya had vanished.<br/><br/>He ran with all his might to the house where Grushenka lived. At<br/>the moment he reached it, Grushenka was on her way to Mokroe. It<br/>was not more than a quarter of an hour after her departure.<br/><br/>Fenya was sitting with her grandmother, the old cook, Matryona,<br/>in the kitchen when "the captain" ran in. Fenya uttered a piercing<br/>shriek on seeing him.<br/><br/>
