<br/>The prosecutor started like a war-horse at the sound of a<br/>trumpet.<br/><br/>"Let me assure you that I fully believe in the complete<br/>sincerity of your conviction and do not explain it by or identify<br/>it with your affection for your unhappy brother. Your peculiar view<br/>of the whole tragic episode is known to us already from the<br/>preliminary investigation. I won't attempt to conceal from you that<br/>it is highly individual and contradicts all the other evidence<br/>collected by the prosecution. And so I think it essential to press<br/>you to tell me what facts have led you to this conviction of your<br/>brother's innocence and of the guilt of another person against whom<br/>you gave evidence at the preliminary inquiry?"<br/><br/>"I only answered the questions asked me at the preliminary<br/>inquiry," replied Alyosha, slowly and calmly. "I made no accusation<br/>against Smerdyakov of myself."<br/><br/>"Yet you gave evidence against him?"<br/><br/>"I was led to do so by my brother Dmitri's words. I was told<br/>what took place at his arrest and how he had pointed to Smerdyakov<br/>before I was examined. I believe absolutely that my brother is<br/>innocent, and if he didn't commit the murder, then-"<br/><br/>"Then Smerdyakov? Why Smerdyakov? And why are you so completely<br/>persuaded of your brother's innocence?"<br/><br/>"I cannot help believing my brother. I know he wouldn't lie to<br/>me. I saw from his face he wasn't lying."<br/><br/>"Only from his face? Is that all the proof you have?"<br/><br/>"I have no other proof."<br/><br/>"And of Smerdyakov's guilt you have no proof whatever but your<br/>brother's word and the expression of his face?"<br/><br/>
