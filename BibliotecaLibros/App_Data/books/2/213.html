"Looking at you, I have made up my mind."<br/><br/>I looked at him.<br/><br/>"Is it possible," I cried, clasping my hands, "that such a<br/>trivial incident could give rise to a resolution in you?"<br/><br/>"My resolution has been growing for the last three years," he<br/>answered, "and your story only gave the last touch to it. Looking<br/>at you, I reproached myself and envied you." He said this to me<br/>almost sullenly.<br/><br/>"But you won't be believed," I observed; "it's fourteen years<br/>ago."<br/><br/>"I have proofs, great proofs. I shall show them."<br/><br/>Then I cried and kissed him.<br/><br/>"Tell me one thing, one thing," he said (as though it all<br/>depended upon me), "my wife, my children! My wife may die of grief,<br/>and though my children won't lose their rank and property, they'll<br/>be a convict's children and for ever! And what a memory, what a<br/>memory of me I shall leave in their hearts!"<br/><br/>I said nothing.<br/><br/>"And to part from them, to leave them for ever? It's for ever,<br/>you know, for ever!" I sat still and repeated a silent prayer. I<br/>got up at last, I felt afraid.<br/><br/>"Well?" He looked at me.<br/>
