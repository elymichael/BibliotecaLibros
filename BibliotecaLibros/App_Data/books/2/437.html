<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>5<br/>By<br/>Ilusha's Bedside<br/><br/><br/>THE room inhabited by the family of the retired captain<br/>Snegiryov is already familiar to the reader. It was close and<br/>crowded at that moment with a number of visitors. Several boys were<br/>sitting with Ilusha, and though all of them, like Smurov, were<br/>prepared to deny that it was Alyosha who had brought them and<br/>reconciled them with Ilusha, it was really the fact. All the art he<br/>had used had been to take them, one by one, to Ilusha, without<br/>"sheepish sentimentality," appearing to do so casually and without<br/>design. It was a great consolation to Ilusha in his suffering. He<br/>was greatly touched by seeing the almost tender affection and<br/>sympathy shown him by these boys, who had been his enemies.<br/>Krassotkin was the only one missing and his absence was a heavy<br/>load on Ilusha's heart. Perhaps the bitterest of all his bitter<br/>memories was his stabbing Krassotkin, who had been his one friend<br/>and protector. Clever little Smurov, who was the first to make it<br/>up with Ilusha, thought it was so. But when Smurov hinted to<br/>Krassotkin that Alyosha wanted to come and see him about something,<br/>the latter cut him short, bidding Smurov tell "Karamazov" at once<br/>that he knew best what to do, that he wanted no one's advice, and<br/>that, if he went to see Ilusha, he would choose his own time for he<br/>had "his own reasons."<br/><br/>That was a fortnight before this Sunday. That was why Alyosha<br/>had not been to see him, as he had meant to. But though he waited<br/>he sent Smurov to him twice again. Both times Krassotkin met him<br/>with a curt, impatient refusal, sending Alyosha a message not to<br/>bother him any more, that if he came himself, he, Krassotkin, would<br/>not go to Ilusha at all. Up to the very last day, Smurov did not<br/>know that Kolya meant to go to Ilusha that morning, and only the<br/>evening before, as he parted from Smurov, Kolya abruptly told him<br/>to wait at home for him next morning, for he would go with him to<br/>the Snegiryovs, but warned him on no account to say he was coming,<br/>as he wanted to drop in casually. Smurov obeyed. Smurov's fancy<br/>that Kolya would bring back the lost dog was based on the words<br/>Kolya had dropped that "they must be asses not to find the dog, if<br/>it was alive." When Smurov, waiting for an opportunity, timidly<br/>hinted at his guess about the dog, Krassotkin flew into a violent<br/>rage. "I'm not such an ass as to go hunting about the town for<br/>other people's dogs when I've got a dog of my own! And how can you<br/>imagine a dog could be alive after swallowing a pin? Sheepish<br/>sentimentality, thats what it is!<br/><br/>For the last fortnight Ilusha had not left his little bed under<br/>the ikons in the corner. He had not been to school since the day he<br/>met Alyosha and bit his finger. He was taken ill the same day,<br/>though for a month afterwards he was sometimes able to get up and<br/>walk about the room and passage. But latterly he had become so weak<br/>that he could not move without help from his father. His father was<br/>terribly concerned about him. He even gave up drinking and was<br/>almost crazy with terror that his boy would die. And often,<br/>especially after leading him round the room on his arm and putting<br/>him back to bed, he would run to a dark corner in the passage and,<br/>leaning his head against the wall, he would break into paroxysms of<br/>violent weeping, stifling his sobs that they might not be heard by<br/>Ilusha.<br/><br/>Returning to the room, he would usually begin doing something to<br/>amuse and comfort his precious boy: he would tell him stories,<br/>funny anecdotes, or would mimic comic people he had happened to<br/>meet, even imitate the howls and cries of animals. But Ilusha could<br/>not bear to see his father fooling and playing the buffoon. Though<br/>the boy tried not to show how he disliked it, he saw with an aching<br/>heart that his father was an object of contempt, and he was<br/>continually haunted by the memory of the "wisp of tow" and that<br/>"terrible day."<br/><br/>Nina, Ilusha's gentle, crippled sister, did not like her<br/>father's buffoonery either (Varvara had been gone for some time<br/>past to Petersburg to study at the university). But the<br/>half-imbecile mother was greatly diverted and laughed heartily when<br/>her husband began capering about or performing something. It was<br/>the only way she could be amused; all the rest of the time she was<br/>grumbling and complaining that now everyone had forgotten her, that<br/>no one treated her with respect, that she was slighted, and so on.<br/>But during the last few days she had completely changed. She began<br/>looking constantly at Ilusha's bed in the corner and seemed lost in<br/>thought. She was more silent, quieter, and, if she cried, she cried<br/>quietly so as not to be heard. The captain noticed the change in<br/>her with mournful perplexity. The boys' visits at first only<br/>angered her, but later on their merry shouts and stories began to<br/>divert her, and at last she liked them so much that, if the boys<br/>had given up coming, she would have felt dreary without them. When<br/>the children told some story or played a game, she laughed and<br/>clapped her hands. She called some of them to her and kissed them.<br/>She was particularly fond of Smurov.<br/><br/>As for the captain, the presence in his room of the children,<br/>who came to cheer up Ilusha, filled his heart from the first with<br/>ecstatic joy. He even hoped that Ilusha would now get over his<br/>depression and that that would hasten his recovery. In spite of his<br/>alarm about Ilusha, he had not, till lately, felt one minute's<br/>doubt of his boy's ultimate recovery.<br/><br/>He met his little visitors with homage, waited upon them hand<br/>and foot; he was ready to be their horse and even began letting<br/>them ride on his back, but Ilusha did not like the game and it was<br/>given up. He began buying little things for them, gingerbread and<br/>nuts, gave them tea and cut them sandwiches. It must be noted that<br/>all this time he had plenty of money. He had taken the two hundred<br/>roubles from Katerina Ivanovna just as Alyosha had predicted he<br/>would. And afterwards Katerina Ivanovna, learning more about their<br/>circumstances and Ilusha's illness, visited them herself, made the<br/>acquaintance of the family, and succeeded in fascinating the<br/>half-imbecile mother. Since then she had been lavish in helping<br/>them, and the captain, terror-stricken at the thought that his boy<br/>might be dying, forgot his pride and humbly accepted her<br/>assistance.<br/>
