<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>1<br/>Father Zossima and His Visitors<br/><br/><br/>WHEN with an anxious and aching heart Alyosha went into his<br/>elder's cell, he stood still almost astonished. Instead of a sick<br/>man at his last gasp, perhaps unconscious, as he had feared to find<br/>him, he saw him sitting up in his chair and, though weak and<br/>exhausted, his face was bright and cheerful, he was surrounded by<br/>visitors and engaged in a quiet and joyful conversation. But he had<br/>only got up from his bed a quarter of an hour before Alyosha's<br/>arrival; his visitors had gathered together in his cell earlier,<br/>waiting for him to wake, having received a most confident assurance<br/>from Father Paissy that "the teacher would get up, and as he had<br/>himself promised in the morning, converse once more with those dear<br/>to his heart." This promise and indeed every word of the dying<br/>elder Father Paissy put implicit trust in. If he had seen him<br/>unconscious, if he had seen him breathe his last, and yet had his<br/>promise that he would rise up and say good-bye to him, he would not<br/>have believed perhaps even in death, but would still have expected<br/>the dead man to recover and fulfil his promise. In the morning as<br/>he lay down to sleep, Father Zossima had told him positively: "I<br/>shall not die without the delight of another conversation with you,<br/>beloved of my heart. I shall look once more on your dear face and<br/>pour out my heart to you once again." The monks, who had gathered<br/>for this probably last conversation with Father Zossima, had all<br/>been his devoted friends for many years. There were four of them:<br/>Father Iosif and Father Paissy, Father Mihail the warden of the<br/>hermitage, a man not very old and far from being learned. He was of<br/>humble origin, of strong will and steadfast faith, of austere<br/>appearance, but of deep tenderness, though he obviously concealed<br/>it as though he were almost ashamed of it. The fourth, Father<br/>Anfim, was a very old and humble little monk of the poorest peasant<br/>class. He was almost illiterate, and very quiet, scarcely speaking<br/>to anyone. He was the humblest of the humble, and looked as though<br/>he had been frightened by something great and awful beyond the<br/>scope of his intelligence. Father Zossima had a great affection for<br/>this timorous man, and always treated him with marked respect,<br/>though perhaps there was no one he had known to whom he had said<br/>less, in spite of the fact that he had spent years wandering about<br/>holy Russia with him. That was very long ago, forty years before,<br/>when Father Zossima first began his life as a monk in a poor and<br/>little monastery at Kostroma, and when, shortly after, he had<br/>accompanied Father Anfim on his pilgrimage to collect alms for<br/>their poor monastery.<br/><br/>The whole party were in the bedroom which, as we mentioned<br/>before, was very small, so that there was scarcely room for the<br/>four of them (in addition to Porfiry, the novice, who stood) to sit<br/>round Father Zossima on chairs brought from the sitting room. It<br/>was already beginning to get dark, the room was lighted up by the<br/>lamps and the candles before the ikons.<br/><br/>Seeing Alyosha standing embarrassed in the doorway, Father<br/>Zossima smiled at him joyfully and held out his hand.<br/><br/>"Welcome, my quiet one, welcome, my dear, here you are too. I<br/>knew you would come."<br/><br/>Alyosha went up to him, bowed down before him to the ground and<br/>wept. Something surged up from his heart, his soul was quivering,<br/>he wanted to sob.<br/><br/>"Come, don't weep over me yet," Father Zossima smiled, laying<br/>his right hand on his head. "You see I am sitting up talking; maybe<br/>I shall live another twenty years yet, as that dear good woman from<br/>Vishegorye, with her little Lizaveta in her arms, wished me<br/>yesterday. God bless the mother and the little girl Lizaveta," he<br/>crossed himself. "Porfiry, did you take her offering where I told<br/>you?"<br/><br/>He meant the sixty copecks brought him the day before by the<br/>good-humoured woman to be given "to someone poorer than me." Such<br/>offerings, always of money gained by personal toil, are made by way<br/>of penance voluntarily undertaken. The elder had sent Porfiry the<br/>evening before to a widow, whose house had been burnt down lately,<br/>and who after the fire had gone with her children begging alms.<br/>Porfiry hastened to reply that he had given the money, as he had<br/>been instructed, "from an unknown benefactress."<br/>
