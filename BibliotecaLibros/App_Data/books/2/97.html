<br/>Ivan and Alyosha caught the old man and were forcibly bringing<br/>him back.<br/><br/>"Why do you run after him? He'll murder you outright," Ivan<br/>cried wrathfully at his father.<br/><br/>"Ivan! Alyosha! She must be here. Grushenka's here. He said he<br/>saw her himself, running."<br/><br/>He was choking. He was not expecting Grushenka at the time, and<br/>the sudden news that she was here made him beside himself. He was<br/>trembling all over. He seemed frantic.<br/><br/>"But you've seen for yourself that she hasn't come," cried<br/>Ivan.<br/><br/>"But she may have come by that other entrance."<br/><br/>"You know that entrance is locked, and you have the key."<br/><br/>Dmitri suddenly reappeared in the drawing-room. He had, of<br/>course, found the other entrance locked, and the key actually was<br/>in Fyodor Pavlovitch's pocket. The windows of all rooms were also<br/>closed, so Grushenka could not have come in anywhere nor have run<br/>out anywhere.<br/><br/>"Hold him!" shrieked Fyodor Pavlovitch, as soon as he saw him<br/>again. "He's been stealing money in my bedroom." And tearing<br/>himself from Ivan he rushed again at Dmitri. But Dmitri threw up<br/>both hands and suddenly clutched the old man by the two tufts of<br/>hair that remained on his temples, tugged at them, and flung him<br/>with a crash on the floor. He kicked him two or three times with<br/>his heel in the face. The old man moaned shrilly. Ivan, though not<br/>so strong as Dmitri, threw his arms round him, and with all his<br/>might pulled him away. Alyosha helped him with his slender<br/>strength, holding Dmitri in front.<br/><br/>"Madman! You've killed him!" cried Ivan.<br/><br/>
