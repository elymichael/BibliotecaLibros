"I will tell you; that's perhaps why I asked you to come, for I<br/>don't know now why I did ask you to come. Well, Ivan Fyodorovitch<br/>has been to see me twice, since he came back from Moscow. First<br/>time he came as a friend to call on me, and the second time Katya<br/>was here and he came because he heard she was here. I didn't, of<br/>course, expect him to come often, knowing what a lot he has to do<br/>as it is, vous comprenez, cette affaire et la mort terrible de<br/>votre papa. (You know, this affair and your father's terrible<br/>death.) But I suddenly heard he'd been here again, not to see me<br/>but to see Lise. That's six days ago now. He came, stayed five<br/>minutes, and went away. And I didn't hear of it till three days<br/>afterwards, from Glafira, so it was a great shock to me. I sent for<br/>Lise directly. She laughed. 'He thought you were asleep,' she said,<br/>'and came in to me to ask after your health.' Of course, that's how<br/>it happened. But Lise, Lise, mercy on us, how she distresses me!<br/>Would you believe it, one night, four days ago, just after you saw<br/>her last time, and had gone away, she suddenly had a fit,<br/>screaming, shrieking, hysterics! Why is it I never have hysterics?<br/>Then, next day another fit, and the same thing on the third, and<br/>yesterday too, and then yesterday that aberration. She suddenly<br/>screamed out, 'I hate Ivan Fyodorovitch. I insist on your never<br/>letting him come to the house again.' I was struck dumb at these<br/>amazing words, and answered, 'On what grounds could I refuse to see<br/>such an excellent young man, a young man of such learning too, and<br/>so unfortunate?'- for all this business is a misfortune, isn't it?'<br/>She suddenly burst out laughing at my words, and so rudely, you<br/>know. Well, I was pleased; I thought I had amused her and the fits<br/>would pass off, especially as I wanted to refuse to see Ivan<br/>Fyodorovitch anyway on account of his strange visits without my<br/>knowledge, and meant to ask him for an explanation. But early this<br/>morning Lise waked up and flew into a passion with Yulia and, would<br/>you believe it, slapped her in the face. That's monstrous; I am<br/>always polite to my servants. And an hour later she was hugging<br/>Yulia's feet and kissing them. She sent a message to me that she<br/>wasn't coming to me at all, and would never come and see me again,<br/>and when I dragged myself down to her, she rushed to kiss me,<br/>crying, and as she kissed me, she pushed me out of the room without<br/>saying a word, so I couldn't find out what was the matter. Now,<br/>dear Alexey Fyodorovitch, I rest all my hopes on you, and, of<br/>course, my whole life is in your hands. I simply beg you to go to<br/>Lise and find out everything from her, as you alone can, and come<br/>back and tell me- me, her mother, for you understand it will be the<br/>death of me, simply the death of me, if this goes on, or else I<br/>shall run away. I can stand no more. I have patience; but I may<br/>lose patience, and then… then something awful will happen. Ah, dear<br/>me! At last, Pyotr Ilyitch!" cried Madame Hohlakov, beaming all<br/>over as she saw Perhotin enter the room. "You are late, you are<br/>late! Well, sit down, speak, put us out of suspense. What does the<br/>counsel say. Where are you off to, Alexey Fyodorovitch?"<br/><br/>"To Lise."<br/><br/>"Oh, yes. You won't forget, you won't forget what I asked you?<br/>It's a question of life and death!<br/><br/>"Of course, I won't forget, if I can… but I am so late,"<br/>muttered Alyosha, beating a hasty retreat.<br/><br/>"No, be sure, be sure to come in; don't say 'If you can.' I<br/>shall die if you don't," Madame Hohlakov called after him, but<br/>Alyosha had already left the room.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
