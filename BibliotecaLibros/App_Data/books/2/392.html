"The devil knows. From bravado perhaps… at having wasted so much<br/>money… . To try and forget that money I had sewn up, perhaps… yes,<br/>that was why… damn it… how often will you ask me that question?<br/>Well, I told a fib, and that was the end of it; once I'd said it, I<br/>didn't care to correct it. What does a man tell lies for<br/>sometimes?"<br/><br/>"That's very difficult to decide, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, what<br/>makes a man tell lies," observed the prosecutor impressively. "Tell<br/>me, though, was that 'amulet,' as you call it, on your neck, a big<br/>thing?"<br/><br/>"No, not big."<br/><br/>"How big, for instance?"<br/><br/>"If you fold a hundred-rouble note in half, that would be the<br/>size."<br/><br/>"You'd better show us the remains of it. You must have them<br/>somewhere."<br/><br/>"Damnation, what nonsense! I don't know where they are."<br/><br/>"But excuse me: where and when did you take it off your neck?<br/>According to your own evidence you didn't go home."<br/><br/>"When I was going from Fenya's to Perhotin's, on the way I tore<br/>it off my neck and took out the money."<br/><br/>"In the dark?"<br/><br/>"What should I want a light for? I did it with my fingers in one<br/>minute."<br/>
