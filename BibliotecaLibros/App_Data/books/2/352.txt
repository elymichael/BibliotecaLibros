"Write it down? You want to write that down? Well, write it; I
consent, I give my full consent, gentlemen, only… do you see?…
Stay, stay, write this. Of disorderly conduct I am guilty, of
violence on a poor old man I am guilty. And there is something else
at the bottom of my heart, of which I am guilty, too but that you
need not write down" (he turned suddenly to the secretary); "that's
my personal life, gentlemen, that doesn't concern you, the bottom
of my heart, that's to say… . But of the murder of my old father
I'm not guilty. That's a wild idea. It's quite a wild idea!… I will
prove you that and you'll be convinced directly… . You will laugh,
gentlemen. You'll laugh yourselves at your suspicion!… "

"Be calm, Dmitri Fyodorovitch," said the investigating lawyer
evidently trying to allay Mitya's excitement by his own composure.
"Before we go on with our inquiry, I should like, if you will
consent to answer, to hear you confirm the statement that you
disliked your father, Fyodor Pavlovitch, that you were involved in
continual disputes with him. Here at least, a quarter of an hour
ago, you exclaimed that you wanted to kill him: 'I didn't kill
him,' you said,'but I wanted to kill him.'"

"Did I exclaim that? Ach, that may be so, gentlemen! Yes,
unhappily, I did want to kill him… many times I wanted to…
unhappily, unhappily!"

"You wanted to. Would you consent to explain what motives
precisely led you to such a sentiment of hatred for your
parent?"

"What is there to explain, gentlemen?" Mitya shrugged his
shoulders sullenly, looking down. "I have never concealed my
feelings. All the town knows about it- everyone knows in the
tavern. Only lately I declared them in Father Zossima's cell. And
the very same day, in the evening I beat my father. I nearly killed
him, and I swore I'd come again and kill him, before witnesses… .
Oh, a thousand witnesses! I've been shouting it aloud for the last
month, anyone can tell you that!… The fact stares you in the face,
it speaks for itself, it cries aloud, but feelings, gentlemen,
feelings are another matter. You see, gentlemen"- Mitya frowned-
"it seemed to me that about feelings you've no right to question
me. I know that you are bound by your office, I quite understand
that, but that's my affair, my private, intimate affair, yet… since
I haven't concealed my feelings in the past… in the tavern, for
instance, I've talked to everyone, so… so I won't make a secret of
it now. You see, I understand, gentlemen, that there are terrible
facts against me in this business. I told everyone that I'd kill
him, and now, all of a sudden, he's been killed. So it must have
been me! Ha ha! I can make allowances for you, gentlemen, I can
quite make allowances. I'm struck all of a heap myself, for who can
have murdered him, if not I? That's what it comes to, isn't it? If
not I, who can it be, who? Gentlemen, I want to know, I insist on
knowing!" he exclaimed suddenly. "Where was he murdered? How was he
murdered? How, and with what? Tell me," he asked quickly, looking
at the two lawyers.

"We found him in his study, lying on his back on the floor, with
his head battered in," said the prosecutor.

"That's horrible!" Mitya shuddered and, putting his elbows on
the table, hid his face in his right hand.

"We will continue," interposed Nikolay Parfenovitch. "So what
was it that impelled you to this sentiment of hatred? You have
asserted in public, I believe, that it was based upon
jealousy?"

"Well, yes, jealousy. not only jealousy."

"Disputes about money?"
