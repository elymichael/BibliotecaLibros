<br/>"I thank you sincerely," said Grushenka, bowing to him, "I'm<br/>going with this old gentleman; I am driving him back to town with<br/>me, and meanwhile, if you'll allow me, I'll wait below to hear what<br/>you decide about Dmitri Fyodorovitch."<br/><br/>She went out. Mitya was calm, and even looked more cheerful, but<br/>only for a moment. He felt more and more oppressed by a strange<br/>physical weakness. His eyes were closing with fatigue. The<br/>examination of the witnesses was, at last, over. They procceded to<br/>a revision of the protocol. Mitya got up, moved from his chair to<br/>the corner by the curtain, lay down on a large chest covered with a<br/>rug, and instantly fell asleep.<br/><br/>He had a strange dream, utterly out of keeping with the place<br/>and the time.<br/><br/>He was driving somewhere in the steppes, where he had been<br/>stationed long ago, and a peasant was driving him in a cart with a<br/>pair of horses, through snow and sleet. He was cold, it was early<br/>in November, and the snow was falling in big wet flakes, melting as<br/>soon as it touched the earth. And the peasant drove him smartly, he<br/>had a fair, long beard. He was not an old man, somewhere about<br/>fifty, and he had on a grey peasant's smock. Not far off was a<br/>village, he could see the black huts, and half the huts were burnt<br/>down, there were only the charred beams sticking up. And as they<br/>drove in, there were peasant women drawn up along the road, a lot<br/>of women, a whole row, all thin and wan, with their faces a sort of<br/>brownish colour, especially one at the edge, a tall, bony woman,<br/>who looked forty, but might have been only twenty, with a long thin<br/>face. And in her arms was a little baby crying. And her breasts<br/>seemed so dried up that there was not a drop of milk in them. And<br/>the child cried and cried, and held out its little bare arms, with<br/>its little fists blue from cold.<br/><br/>"Why are they crying? Why are they crying?" Mitya asked, as they<br/>dashed gaily by.<br/><br/>"It's the babe," answered the driver, "the babe weeping."<br/><br/>And Mitya was struck by his saying, in his peasant way, "the<br/>babe," and he liked the peasant's calling it a "babe." There seemed<br/>more pity in it.<br/><br/>"But why is it weeping?" Mitya persisted stupidly, "why are its<br/>little arms bare? Why don't they wrap it up?"<br/><br/>"The babe's cold, its little clothes are frozen and don't warm<br/>it."<br/><br/>"But why is it? Why?" foolish Mitya still persisted.<br/><br/>
