"Who? You mean the myth about that crazy idiot, the epileptic,
Smerdyakov?"

Alyosha suddenly felt himself trembling all over.

"You know who," broke helplessly from him. He could scarcely
breathe.

"Who? Who?" Ivan cried almost fiercely. All his restraint
suddenly vanished.

"I only know one thing," Alyosha went on, still almost in a
whisper, "it wasn't you killed father."

"'Not you'! What do you mean by 'not you'?" Ivan was
thunderstruck.

"It was not you killed father, not you! Alyosha repeated
firmly.

The silence lasted for half a minute.

"I know I didn't. Are you raving?" said Ivan, with a pale,
distorted smile. His eyes were riveted on Alyosha. They were
standing again under a lamp-post.

"No, Ivan. You've told yourself several times that you are the
murderer."

"When did I say so? I was in Moscowâ€¦ . When have I said so?"
Ivan faltered helplessly.
