<br/>"No, I'm not going to play any more," observed Kalganov, "I've<br/>lost fifty roubles to them just now."<br/><br/>"The pan had no luck, perhaps he'll be lucky this time," the<br/>Pole on the sofa observed in his direction.<br/><br/>"How much in the bank? To correspond?" asked Mitya.<br/><br/>"That's according, panie, maybe a hundred, maybe two hundred, as<br/>much as you will stake." "A million!" laughed Mitya.<br/><br/>"The Pan Captain has heard of Pan Podvysotsky, perhaps?"<br/><br/>"What Podvysotsky?"<br/><br/>"In Warsaw there was a bank and anyone comes and stakes against<br/>it. Podvysotsky comes, sees a thousand gold pieces, stakes against<br/>the bank. The banker says, 'Panie Podvysotsky, are you laying down<br/>the gold, or must we trust to your honour?' 'To my honour, panie,'<br/>says Podvysotsky. 'So much the better.' The banker throws the dice.<br/>Podvysotsky wins. 'Take it, panie,' says the banker, and pulling<br/>out the drawer he gives him a million. 'Take it, panie, this is<br/>your gain.' There was a million in the bank. 'I didn't know that,'<br/>says Podvysotsky. 'Panie Podvysotsky,' said the banker, 'you<br/>pledged your honour and we pledged ours.' Podvysotsky took the<br/>million."<br/><br/>"That's not true," said Kalganov.<br/><br/>"Panie Kalganov, in gentlemanly society one doesn't say such<br/>things."<br/><br/>"As if a Polish gambler would give away a million!" cried Mitya,<br/>but checked himself at once. "Forgive me, panie, it's my fault<br/>again; he would, he would give away a million, for honour, for<br/>Polish honour. You see how I talk Polish, ha ha! Here, I stake ten<br/>roubles, the knave leads."<br/><br/>
