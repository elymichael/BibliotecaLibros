"How do you mean, offering herself?" exclaimed Alyosha.

"As wanton women offer themselves, to be sure."

"How can you, Ivan, how can you?" Alyosha cried warmly, in a
grieved voice. "She is a child; you are insulting a child! She is
ill; she is very ill, too. She is on the verge of insanity, too,
perhaps… . I had hoped to hear something from you… that would save
her."

"You'll hear nothing from me. If she is a child, I am not her
nurse. Be quiet, Alexey. Don't go on about her. I am not even
thinking about it."

They were silent again for a moment.

"She will be praying all night now to the Mother of God to show
her how to act to-morrow at the trial," he said sharply and angrily
again.

"You… you mean Katerina Ivanovna?"

"Yes. Whether she's to save Mitya or ruin him. She'll pray for
light from above. She can't make up her mind for herself, you see.
She has not had time to decide yet. She takes me for her nurse,
too. She wants me to sing lullabies to her."

"Katerina Ivanovna loves you, brother," said Alyosha sadly.

"Perhaps; but I am not very keen on her."

"She is suffering. Why do you… sometimes say things to her that
give her hope?" Alyosha went on, with timid reproach. "I know that
you've given her hope. Forgive me for speaking to you like this,"
he added.
