You frightened me, Rakitin, that's what it is." Grushenka turned
with a smile to Alyosha. "Don't be afraid of me, my dear Alyosha,
you cannot think how glad I am to see you, my unexpected visitor.
But you frightened me, Rakitin, I thought it was Mitya breaking in.
You see, I deceived him just now, I made him promise to believe me
and I told him a lie. I told him that I was going to spend the
evening with my old man, Kuzma Kuzmitch, and should be there till
late counting up his money. I always spend one whole evening a week
with him making up his accounts. We lock ourselves in and he counts
on the reckoning beads while I sit and put things down in the book.
I am the only person he trusts. Mitya believes that I am there, but
I came back and have been sitting locked in here, expecting some
news. How was it Fenya let you in? Fenya, Fenya, run out to the
gate, open it and look about whether the captain is to be seen!
Perhaps he is hiding and spying, I am dreadfully frightened."

There's no one there, Agrafena Alexandrovna, I've just looked
out; I keep running to peep through the crack; I am in fear and
trembling myself."

"Are the shutters fastened, Fenya? And we must draw the
curtains- that's better!" She drew the heavy curtains herself.
"He'd rush in at once if he saw a light. I am afraid of your
brother Mitya to-day, Alyosha."

Grushenka spoke aloud, and, though she was alarmed, she seemed
very happy about something.

"Why are you so afraid of Mitya to-day?" inquired Rakitin. "I
should have thought you were not timid with him, you'd twist him
round your little finger."

"I tell you, I am expecting news, priceless news, so I don't
want Mitya at all. And he didn't believe, I feel he didn't, that I
should stay at Kuzma Kuzmitch's. He must be in his ambush now,
behind Fyodor Pavlovitch's, in the garden, watching for me. And if
he's there, he won't come here, so much the better! But I really
have been to Kuzma Kuzmitch's, Mitya escorted me there. I told him
I should stay there till midnight, and I asked him to be sure to
come at midnight to fetch me home. He went away and I sat ten
minutes with Kuzma Kuzmitch and came back here again. Ugh, I was
afraid, I ran for fear of meeting him."

"And why are you so dressed up? What a curious cap you've got
on!"

"How curious you are yourself, Rakitin! I tell you, I am
expecting a message. If the message comes, I shall fly, I shall
gallop away and you will see no more of me. That's why I am dressed
up, so as to be ready."

"And where are you flying to?"

"If you know too much, you'll get old too soon."

"Upon my word! You are highly delightedâ€¦ I've never seen you
like this before. You are dressed up as if you were going to a
ball." Rakitin looked her up and down.
