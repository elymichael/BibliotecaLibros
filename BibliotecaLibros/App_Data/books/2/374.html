<br/>"You spoke to Mr. Perhotin, I believe, of having received three<br/>thousand from Madame Hohlakov."<br/><br/>"Perhaps I did. Enough, gentlemen. I won't say how much I<br/>had."<br/><br/>"Will you be so good then as to tell us how you came here and<br/>what you have done since you arrived?"<br/><br/>"Oh! you might ask the people here about that.

But here's my money- count it- take it. That's<br/>all, I think."<br/><br/>He turned it all out of his pockets; even the small change- two<br/>pieces of twenty copecks- he pulled out of his waistcoat pocket.<br/>They counted the money, which amounted to eight hundred and<br/>thirty-six roubles, and forty copecks.<br/><br/>"And is that all?" asked the investigating lawyer.<br/><br/>"You stated just now in your evidence that you spent three<br/>hundred roubles at Plotnikovs'. You gave Perhotin ten, your driver<br/>twenty, here you lost two hundred, thenâ€¦ "<br/><br/>
