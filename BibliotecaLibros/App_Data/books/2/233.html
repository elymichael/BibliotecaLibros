<br/>"You here, Alexey? Can you have- " he began wondering but broke<br/>off. He had meant to say, "Can you have come to this?"<br/><br/>Alyosha did not look at him, but from a slight movement Rakitin<br/>at once saw that he heard and understood him.<br/><br/>"What's the matter?" he went on; but the surprise in his face<br/>gradually passed into a smile that became more and more<br/>ironical.<br/><br/>"I say, I've been looking for you for the last two hours. You<br/>suddenly disappeared. What are you about? What foolery is this? You<br/>might just look at meâ€¦ "<br/><br/>Alyosha raised his head, sat up and leaned his back against the<br/>tree.

It's long<br/>since I've been surprised at anything here. I always took you for<br/>an educated man.<br/><br/>Alyosha at last looked at him, but vaguely, as though scarcely<br/>understanding what he said.<br/><br/>"Can you really be so upset simply because your old man has<br/>begun to stink? You don't mean to say you seriously believed that<br/>he was going to work miracles?" exclaimed Rakitin, genuinely<br/>surprised again.<br/><br/>
