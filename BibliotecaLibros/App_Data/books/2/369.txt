"You're making fun of me, aren't you?" asked Mitya, looking
haughtily at the speaker; but the latter did not flinch.

Mitya turned abruptly, sat astride on his chair, and swung his
arm.

"This was how I struck him! That's how I knocked him down! What
more do you want?"

"Thank you. May I trouble you now to explain why you jumped
down, with what object, and what you had in view?"

"Oh, hang it!… I jumped down to look at the man I'd hurt… I
don't know what for!"

"Though you were so excited and were running away?"

"Yes, though I was excited and running away."

"You wanted to help him?"

"Help!… Yes, perhaps I did want to help him… . I don't
remember."

"You don't remember? Then you didn't quite know what you were
doing?"

"Not at all. I remember everything- every detail. I jumped down
to look at him, and wiped his face with my handkerchief."
