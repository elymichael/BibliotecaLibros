<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>6<br/>The Prosecutor Catches Mitya<br/><br/><br/>SOMETHING utterly unexpected and amazing to Mitya followed. He<br/>could never, even a minute before, have conceived that anyone could<br/>behave like that to him, Mitya Karamazov. What was worst of all,<br/>there was something humiliating in it, and on their side something<br/>"supercilious and scornful." It was nothing to take off his coat,<br/>but he was asked to undress further, or rather not asked but<br/>"commanded," he quite understood that. From pride and contempt he<br/>submitted without a word. Several peasants accompanied the lawyers<br/>and remained on the same side of the curtain. "To be ready if force<br/>is required," thought Mitya, "and perhaps for some other reason,<br/>too."<br/><br/>"Well, must I take off my shirt, too?" he asked sharply, but<br/>Nikolay Parfenovitch did not answer. He was busily engaged with the<br/>prosecutor in examining the coat, the trousers, the waistcoat and<br/>the cap; and it was evident that they were both much interested in<br/>the scrutiny. "They make no bones about it," thought Mitya, "they<br/>don't keep up the most elementary politeness."<br/><br/>"I ask you for the second time- need I take off my shirt or<br/>not?" he said, still more sharply and irritably.<br/><br/>"Don't trouble yourself. We will tell you what to do," Nikolay<br/>Parfenovitch said, and his voice was positively peremptory, or so<br/>it seemed to Mitya.<br/><br/>Meantime a consultation was going on in undertones between the<br/>lawyers. There turned out to be on the coat, especially on the left<br/>side at the back, a huge patch of blood, dry, and still stiff.<br/>There were bloodstains on the trousers, too. Nikolay Parfenovitch,<br/>moreover, in the presence of the peasant witnesses, passed his<br/>fingers along the collar, the cuffs, and all the seams of the coat<br/>and trousers, obviously looking for something- money, of course. He<br/>didn't even hide from Mitya his suspicion that he was capable of<br/>sewing money up in his clothes.<br/><br/>"He treats me not as an officer but as a thief," Mitya muttered<br/>to himself. They communicated their ideas to one another with<br/>amazing frankness. The secretary, for instance, who was also behind<br/>the curtain, fussing about and listening, called Nikolay<br/>Parfenovitch's attention to the cap, which they were also<br/>fingering.<br/><br/>"You remember Gridyenko, the copying clerk," observed the<br/>secretary. "Last summer he received the wages of the whole office,<br/>and pretended to have lost the money when he was drunk. And where<br/>was it found? Why, in just such pipings in his cap. The<br/>hundred-rouble notes were screwed up in little rolls and sewed in<br/>the piping."<br/>
