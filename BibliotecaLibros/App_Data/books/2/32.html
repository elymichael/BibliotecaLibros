<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>4<br/>A<br/>Lady of Little Faith<br/><br/><br/>A visitor looking on the scene of his conversation with the<br/>peasants and his blessing them shed silent tears and wiped them<br/>away with her handkerchief. She was a sentimental society lady of<br/>genuinely good disposition in many respects. When the elder went up<br/>to her at last she met him enthusiastically.<br/><br/>"Ah, what I have been feeling, looking on at this touching<br/>scene!â€¦ "She could not go on for emotion. "Oh, I understand the<br/>people's love for you. I love the people myself. I want to love<br/>them. And who could help loving them, our splendid Russian people,<br/>so simple in their greatness!"<br/><br/>"How is your daughter's health? You wanted to talk to me<br/>again?"<br/><br/>"Oh, I have been urgently begging for it, I have prayed for it!<br/>I was ready to fall on my knees and kneel for three days at your<br/>windows until you let me in. We have come, great healer, to express<br/>our ardent gratitude. You have healed my Lise, healed her<br/>completely, merely by praying over her last Thursday and laying<br/>your hands upon her. We have hastened here to kiss those hands, to<br/>pour out our feelings and our homage."<br/><br/>"What do you mean by healed? But she is still lying down in her<br/>chair."<br/><br/>"But her night fevers have entirely ceased ever since Thursday,"<br/>said the lady with nervous haste. "And that's not all. Her legs are<br/>stronger. This mourning she got up well; she had slept all night.<br/>Look at her rosy cheeks, her bright eyes! She used to be always<br/>crying, but now she laughs and is gay and happy. This morning she<br/>insisted on my letting her stand up, and she stood up for a whole<br/>minute without any support. She wagers that in a fortnight she'll<br/>be dancing a quadrille. I've called in Doctor Herzenstube. He<br/>shrugged his shoulders and said, 'I am amazed; I can make nothing<br/>of it.' And would you have us not come here to disturb you, not fly<br/>here to thank you? Lise, thank him- thank him!"<br/><br/>Lise's pretty little laughing face became suddenly serious. She<br/>rose in her chair as far as she could and, looking at the elder,<br/>clasped her hands before him, but could not restrain herself and<br/>broke into laughter.<br/>
