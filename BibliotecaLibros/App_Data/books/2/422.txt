"I like to watch such realistic scenes, Smurov," said Kolya
suddenly. "Have you noticed how dogs sniff at one another when they
meet? It seems to be a law of their nature."

"Yes; it's a funny habit."

"No, it's not funny; you are wrong there. There's nothing funny
in nature, however funny it may seem to man with his prejudices. If
dogs could reason and criticise us they'd be sure to find just as
much that would be funny to them, if not far more, in the social
relations of men, their masters- far more, indeed. I repeat that,
because I am convinced that there is far more foolishness among us.
That's Rakitin's idea- a remarkable idea. I am a Socialist,
Smurov."

"And what is a Socialist?" asked Smurov.

"That's when all are equal and all have property in common,
there are no marriages, and everyone has any religion and laws he
likes best, and all the rest of it. You are not old enough to
understand that yet. It's cold, though."

"Yes, twelve degrees of frost. Father looked at the thermometer
just now."

"Have you noticed, Smurov, that in the middle of winter we don't
feel so cold even when there are fifteen or eighteen degrees of
frost as we do now, in the beginning of winter, when there is a
sudden frost of twelve degrees, especially when there is not much
snow. It's because people are not used to it. Everything is habit
with men, everything even in their social and political relations.
Habit is the great motive-power. What a funny-looking peasant!"

Kolya pointed to a tall peasant, with a good-natured countenance
in a long sheepskin coat, who was standing by his wagon, clapping
together his hands, in their shapeless leather gloves, to warm
them. His long fair beard was all white with frost.

"That peasant's beard's frozen," Kolya cried in a loud
provocative voice as he passed him.

"Lots of people's beards are frozen," the peasant replied,
calmly and sententiously.
