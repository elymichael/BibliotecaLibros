<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>7<br/>An<br/>Historical Survey<br/><br/><br/>"THE medical experts have striven to convince us that the<br/>prisoner is out of his mind and, in fact, a maniac. I maintain that<br/>he is in his right mind, and that if he had not been, he would have<br/>behaved more cleverly. As for his being a maniac, that I would<br/>agree with, but only in one point, that is, his fixed idea about<br/>the three thousand. Yet I think one might find a much simpler cause<br/>than his tendency to insanity. For my part I agree thoroughly with<br/>the young doctor who maintained that the prisoner's mental<br/>faculties have always been normal, and that he has only been<br/>irritable and exasperated. The object of the prisoner's continual<br/>and violent anger was not the sum itself; there was a special<br/>motive at the bottom of it. That motive is jealousy!"<br/><br/>Here Ippolit Kirillovitch described at length the prisoner's<br/>fatal passion for Grushenka. He began from the moment when the<br/>prisoner went to the "young person's" lodgings "to beat her"- "I<br/>use his own expression," the prosecutor explained- "but instead of<br/>beating her, he remained there, at her feet. That was the beginning<br/>of the passion. At the same time the prisoner's father was<br/>captivated by the same young person- a strange and fatal<br/>coincidence, for they both lost their hearts to her simultaneously,<br/>though both had known her before. And she inspired in both of them<br/>the most violent, characteristically Karamazov passion. We have her<br/>own confession: 'I was laughing at both of them.' Yes, the sudden<br/>desire to make a jest of them came over her, and she conquered both<br/>of them at once. The old man, who worshipped money, at once set<br/>aside three thousand roubles as a reward for one visit from her,<br/>but soon after that, he would have been happy to lay his property<br/>and his name at her feet, if only she would become his lawful wife.<br/>We have good evidence of this. As for the prisoner, the tragedy of<br/>his fate is evident; it is before us. But such was the young<br/>person's 'game.' The enchantress gave the unhappy young man no hope<br/>until the last moment, when he knelt before her, stretching out<br/>hands that were already stained with the blood of his father and<br/>rival. It was in that position that he was arrested. 'Send me to<br/>Siberia with him, I have brought him to this, I am most to blame,'<br/>the woman herself cried, in genuine remorse at the moment of his<br/>arrest.<br/><br/>"The talented young man, to whom I have referred already, Mr.<br/>Rakitin, characterised this heroine in brief and impressive terms:<br/>'She was disillusioned early in life, deceived and ruined by a<br/>betrothed, who seduced and abandoned her. She was left in poverty,<br/>cursed by her respectable family and taken under the protection of<br/>a wealthy old man, whom she still, however, considers as her<br/>benefactor. There was perhaps much that was good in her young<br/>heart, but it was embittered too early. She became prudent and<br/>saved money. She grew sarcastic and resentful against society.'<br/>After this sketch of her character it may well be understood that<br/>she might laugh at both of them simply from mischief, from<br/>malice.<br/><br/>"After a month of hopeless love and moral degradation, during<br/>which he betrayed his betrothed and appropriated money entrusted to<br/>his honour, the prisoner was driven almost to frenzy, almost to<br/>madness by continual jealousy- and of whom? His father! And the<br/>worst of it was that the crazy old man was alluring and enticing<br/>the object of his affection by means of that very three thousand<br/>roubles, which the son looked upon as his own property, part of his<br/>inheritance from his mother, of which his father was cheating him.<br/>Yes, I admit it was hard to bear! It might well drive a man to<br/>madness. It was not the money, but the fact that this money was<br/>used with such revolting cynicism to ruin his happiness!"<br/><br/>Then the prosecutor went on to describe how the idea of<br/>murdering his father had entered the prisoner's head, and<br/>illustrated his theory with facts.<br/><br/>"At first he only talked about it in taverns- he was talking<br/>about it all that month. Ah, he likes being always surrounded with<br/>company, and he likes to tell his companions everything, even his<br/>most diabolical and dangerous ideas; he likes to share every<br/>thought with others, and expects, for some reason, that those he<br/>confides in will meet him with perfect sympathy, enter into all his<br/>troubles and anxieties, take his part and not oppose him in<br/>anything. If not, he flies into a rage and smashes up everything in<br/>the tavern. (Then followed the anecdote about Captain Snegiryov.)<br/>Those who heard the prisoner began to think at last that he might<br/>mean more than threats, and that such a frenzy might turn threats<br/>into actions."<br/><br/>Here the prosecutor described the meeting of the family at the<br/>monastery, the conversations with Alyosha, and the horrible scene<br/>of violence when the prisoner had rushed into his father's house<br/>just after dinner.<br/>
