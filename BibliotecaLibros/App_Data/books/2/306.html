<br/>Trifon Borissovitch was a thick-set, healthy peasant, of middle<br/>height, with a rather fat face. His expression was severe and<br/>uncompromising, especially with the peasants of Mokroe, but he had<br/>the power of assuming the most obsequious countenance, when he had<br/>an inkling that it was to his interest. He dressed in Russian<br/>style, with a shirt buttoning down on one side, and a full-skirted<br/>coat. He had saved a good sum of money, but was for ever dreaming<br/>of improving his position. More than half the peasants were in his<br/>clutches, everyone in the neighbourhood was in debt to him. From<br/>the neighbouring landowners he bought and rented lands which were<br/>worked by the peasants, in payment of debts which they could never<br/>shake off. He was a widower, with four grown-up daughters. One of<br/>them was already a widow and lived in the inn with her two<br/>children, his grandchildren, and worked for him like a charwoman.<br/>Another of his daughters was married to a petty official, and in<br/>one of the rooms of the inn, on the wall could be seen, among the<br/>family photographs, a miniature photograph of this official in<br/>uniform and official epaulettes. The two younger daughters used to<br/>wear fashionable blue or green dresses, fitting tight at the back,<br/>and with trains a yard long, on Church holidays or when they went<br/>to pay visits. But next morning they would get up at dawn, as<br/>usual, sweep out the rooms with a birch-broom, empty the slops, and<br/>clean up after lodgers.<br/><br/>In spite of the thousands of roubles he had saved, Trifon<br/>Borissovitch was very fond of emptying the pockets of a drunken<br/>guest, and remembering that not a month ago he had, in twenty-four<br/>hours, made two if not three hundred roubles out of Dmitri, when he<br/>had come on his escapade with Grushenka, he met him now with eager<br/>welcome, scenting his prey the moment Mitya drove up to the<br/>steps.<br/><br/>"Dmitri Fyodorovitch, dear sir, we see you once more!"<br/><br/>"Stay, Trifon Borissovitch," began Mitya, "first and foremost,<br/>where is she?"<br/><br/>"Agrafena Alexandrovna?" The inn-keeper understood at once,<br/>looking sharply into Mitya's face. "She's here, tooâ€¦ "<br/><br/>"With whom? With whom?"<br/><br/>"Some strangers. One is an official gentleman, a Pole, to judge<br/>from his speech. He sent the horses for her from here; and there's<br/>another with him, a friend of his, or a fellow traveller, there's<br/>no telling. They're dressed like civilians."<br/><br/>"Well, are they feasting? Have they money?"<br/><br/>"Poor sort of a feast! Nothing to boast of, Dmitri<br/>Fyodorovitch."<br/><br/>"Nothing to boast of? And who are the others?"<br/><br/>
