<br/>"The prisoner, running away in the garden in the dark, climbed<br/>over the fence, was seized by the servant, and knocked him down<br/>with a brass pestle. Then he jumped back into the garden and spent<br/>five minutes over the man, trying to discover whether he had killed<br/>him or not. And the prosecutor refuses to believe the prisoner's<br/>statement that he ran to old Grigory out of pity. 'No,' he says,<br/>'such sensibility is impossible at such a moment, that's unnatural;<br/>he ran to find out whether the only witness of his crime was dead<br/>or alive, and so showed that he had committed the murder, since he<br/>would not have run back for any other reason.'<br/><br/>"Here you have psychology; but let us take the same method and<br/>apply it to the case the other way round, and our result will be no<br/>less probable. The murderer, we are told, leapt down to find out,<br/>as a precaution, whether the witness was alive or not, yet he had<br/>left in his murdered father's study, as the prosecutor himself<br/>argues, an amazing piece of evidence in the shape of a torn<br/>envelope, with an inscription that there had been three thousand<br/>roubles in it. 'If he had carried that envelope away with him, no<br/>one in the world would have known of that envelope and of the notes<br/>in it, and that the money had been stolen by the prisoner.' Those<br/>are the prosecutor's own words. So on one side you see a complete<br/>absence of precaution, a man who has lost his head and run away in<br/>a fright, leaving that clue on the floor, and two minutes later,<br/>when he has killed another man, we are entitled to assume the most<br/>heartless and calculating foresight in him. But even admitting this<br/>was so, it is psychological subtlety, I suppose, that discerns that<br/>under certain circumstances I become as bloodthirsty and<br/>keen-sighted as a Caucasian eagle, while at the next I am as timid<br/>and blind as a mole. But if I am so bloodthirsty and cruelly<br/>calculating that when I kill a man I only run back to find out<br/>whether he is alive to witness against me, why should I spend five<br/>minutes looking after my victim at the risk of encountering other<br/>witnesses? Why soak my handkerchief, wiping the blood off his head<br/>so that it may be evidence against me later? If he were so<br/>cold-hearted and calculating, why not hit the servant on the head<br/>again and again with the same pestle so as to kill him outright and<br/>relieve himself of all anxiety about the witness?<br/><br/>"Again, though he ran to see whether the witness was alive, he<br/>left another witness on the path, that brass pestle which he had<br/>taken from the two women, and which they could always recognise<br/>afterwards as theirs, and prove that he had taken it from them. And<br/>it is not as though he had forgotten it on the path, dropped it<br/>through carelessness or haste, no, he had flung away his weapon,<br/>for it was found fifteen paces from where Grigory lay. Why did he<br/>do so? just because he was grieved at having killed a man, an old<br/>servant; and he flung away the pestle with a curse, as a murderous<br/>weapon. That's how it must have been, what other reason could he<br/>have had for throwing it so far? And if he was capable of feeling<br/>grief and pity at having killed a man, it shows that he was<br/>innocent of his father's murder. Had he murdered him, he would<br/>never have run to another victim out of pity; then he would have<br/>felt differently; his thoughts would have been centred on<br/>self-preservation. He would have had none to spare for pity, that<br/>is beyond doubt. On the contrary, he would have broken his skull<br/>instead of spending five minutes looking after him. There was room<br/>for pity and good-feeling just because his conscience had been<br/>clear till then. Here we have a different psychology. I have<br/>purposely resorted to this method, gentlemen of the jury, to show<br/>that you can prove anything by it. It all depends on who makes use<br/>of it. Psychology lures even most serious people into romancing,<br/>and quite unconsciously. I am speaking of the abuse of psychology,<br/>gentlemen."<br/><br/>Sounds of approval and laughter, at the expense of the<br/>prosecutor, were again audible in the court. I will not repeat the<br/>speech in detail; I will only quote some passages from it, some<br/>leading points.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
