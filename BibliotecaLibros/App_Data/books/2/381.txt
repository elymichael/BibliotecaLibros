He was asked to go back to the "other room." Mitya went in,
scowling with anger, and trying to avoid looking at anyone. Dressed
in another man's clothes he felt himself disgraced, even in the
eyes of the peasants, and of Trifon Borissovitch, whose face
appeared, for some reason, in the doorway, and vanished
immediately. "He's come to look at me dressed up," thought Mitya.
He sat down on the same chair as before. He had an absurd
nightmarish feeling, as though he were out of his mind.

"Well, what now? Are you going to flog me? That's all that's
left for you," he said, clenching his teeth and addressing the
prosecutor. He would not turn to Nikolay Parfenovitch, as though he
disdained to speak to him.

"He looked too closely at my socks, and turned them inside out
on purpose to show everyone how dirty they were- the
scoundrel!"

"Well, now we must proceed to the examination of witnesses,"
observed Nikolay Parfenovitch, as though in reply to Mitya's
question.

"Yes," said the prosecutor thoughtfully, as though reflecting on
something.

"We've done what we could in your interest, Dmitri
Fyodorovitch," Nikolay Parfenovitch went on, "but having received
from you such an uncompromising refusal to explain to us the source
from which you obtained the money found upon you, we are, at the
present moment-"

"What is the stone in your ring?" Mitya interrupted suddenly, as
though awakening from a reverie. He pointed to one of the three
large rings adorning Nikolay Parfenovitch's right hand.

"Ring?" repeated Nikolay Parfenovitch with surprise.

"Yes, that one… on your middle finger, with the little veins in
it, what stone is that?" Mitya persisted, like a peevish child.

"That's a smoky topaz," said Nikolay Parfenovitch, smiling.
"Would you like to look at it? I'll take it off… "

"No, don't take it off," cried Mitya furiously, suddenly waking
up, and angry with himself. "Don't take it off… there's no need… .
Damn it!… Gentlemen, you've sullied my heart! Can you suppose that
I would conceal it from you, if I had really killed my father, that
I would shuffle, lie, and hide myself? No, that's not like Dmitri
Karamazov, that he couldn't do, and if I were guilty, I swear I
shouldn't have waited for your coming, or for the sunrise as I
meant at first, but should have killed myself before this, without
waiting for the dawn! I know that about myself now. I couldn't have
learnt so much in twenty years as I've found out in this accursed
night!… And should I have been like this on this night, and at this
moment, sitting with you, could I have talked like this, could I
have moved like this, could I have looked at you and at the world
like this, if I had really been the murderer of my father, when the
very thought of having accidentally killed Grigory gave me no peace
all night- not from fear- oh, not simply from fear of your
punishment! The disgrace of it! And you expect me to be open with
such scoffers as you, who see nothing and believe in nothing, blind
moles and scoffers, and to tell you another nasty thing I've done,
another disgrace, even if that would save me from your accusation!
No, better Siberia! The man who opened the door to my father and
went in at that door, he killed him, he robbed him. Who was he? I'm
racking my brains and can't think who. But I can tell you it was
not Dmitri Karamazov, and that's all I can tell you, and that's
enough, enough, leave me alone… . Exile me, punish me, but don't
bother me any more. I'll say no more. Call your witnesses!"
