<br/>About two o'clock when everything was quiet, and even Fyodor<br/>Pavlovitch had gone to bed, Ivan had got into bed, firmly resolved<br/>to fall asleep at once, as he felt fearfully exhausted. And he did<br/>fall asleep at once, and slept soundly without dreams, but waked<br/>early, at seven o'clock, when it was broad daylight. Opening his<br/>eyes, he was surprised to feel himself extraordinarily vigorous. He<br/>jumped up at once and dressed quickly; then dragged out his trunk<br/>and began packing immediately. His linen had come back from the<br/>laundress the previous morning. Ivan positively smiled at the<br/>thought that everything was helping his sudden departure. And his<br/>departure certainly was sudden. Though Ivan had said the day before<br/>(to Katerina Ivanovna, Alyosha, and Smerdyakov) that he was leaving<br/>next day, yet he remembered that he had no thought of departure<br/>when he went to bed, or, at least, had not dreamed that his first<br/>act in the morning would be to pack his trunk. At last his trunk<br/>and bag were ready. It was about nine o'clock when Marfa Ignatyevna<br/>came in with her usual inquiry, "Where will your honour take your<br/>tea, in your own room or downstairs?" He looked almost cheerful,<br/>but there was about him, about his words and gestures, something<br/>hurried and scattered. Greeting his father affably, and even<br/>inquiring specially after his health, though he did not wait to<br/>hear his answer to the end, he announced that he was starting off<br/>in an hour to return to Moscow for good, and begged him to send for<br/>the horses. His father heard this announcement with no sign of<br/>surprise, and forgot in an unmannerly way to show regret at losing<br/>him. Instead of doing so, he flew into a great flutter at the<br/>recollection of some important business of his own.<br/><br/>"What a fellow you are! Not to tell me yesterday! Never mind;<br/>we'll manage it all the same. Do me a great service, my dear boy.<br/>Go to Tchermashnya on the way. It's only to turn to the left from<br/>the station at Volovya, only another twelve versts and you come to<br/>Tchermashnya."<br/><br/>"I'm sorry, I can't. It's eighty versts to the railway and the<br/>train starts for Moscow at seven o'clock to-night. I can only just<br/>catch it."<br/><br/>"You'll catch it to-morrow or the day after, but to-day turn off<br/>to Tchermashnya. It won't put you out much to humour your father!<br/>If I hadn't had something to keep me here, I would have run over<br/>myself long ago, for I've some business there in a hurry. But here<br/>I… it's not the time for me to go now… . You see, I've two pieces<br/>of copse land there. The Maslovs, an old merchant and his son, will<br/>give eight thousand for the timber. But last year I just missed a<br/>purchaser who would have given twelve. There's no getting anyone<br/>about here to buy it. The Maslovs have it all their own way. One<br/>has to take what they'll give, for no one here dare bid against<br/>them. The priest at Ilyinskoe wrote to me last Thursday that a<br/>merchant called Gorstkin, a man I know, had turned up. What makes<br/>him valuable is that he is not from these parts, so he is not<br/>afraid of the Maslovs. He says he will give me eleven thousand for<br/>the copse. Do you hear? But he'll only be here, the priest writes,<br/>for a week altogether, so you must go at once and make a bargain<br/>with him."<br/><br/>"Well, you write to the priest; he'll make the bargain."<br/><br/>"He can't do it. He has no eye for business. He is a perfect<br/>treasure, I'd give him twenty thousand to take care of for me<br/>without a receipt; but he has no eye for business, he is a perfect<br/>child, a crow could deceive him. And yet he is a learned man, would<br/>you believe it? This Gorstkin looks like a peasant, he wears a blue<br/>kaftan, but he is a regular rogue. That's the common complaint. He<br/>is a liar. Sometimes he tells such lies that you wonder why he is<br/>doing it. He told me the year before last that his wife was dead<br/>and that he had married another, and would you believe it, there<br/>was not a word of truth in it? His wife has never died at all, she<br/>is alive to this day and gives him a beating twice a week. So what<br/>you have to find out is whether he is lying or speaking the truth<br/>when he says he wants to buy it and would give eleven<br/>thousand."<br/><br/>"I shall be no use in such a business. I have no eye<br/>either."<br/><br/>"Stay, wait a bit! You will be of use, for I will tell you the<br/>signs by which you can judge about Gorstkin. I've done business<br/>with him a long time. You see, you must watch his beard; he has a<br/>nasty, thin, red beard. If his beard shakes when he talks and he<br/>gets cross, it's all right, he is saying what he means, he wants to<br/>do business. But if he strokes his beard with his left hand and<br/>grins- he is trying to cheat you. Don't watch his eyes, you won't<br/>find out anything from his eyes, he is a deep one, a rogue but<br/>watch his beard! I'll give you a note and you show it to him. He's<br/>called Gorstkin, though his real name is Lyagavy;<br/>[9]<br/>but don't call him so, he will be<br/>offended. If you come to an understanding with him, and see it's<br/>all right, write here at once. You need only write: 'He's not<br/>lying.' Stand out for eleven thousand; one thousand you can knock<br/>off, but not more. just think! there's a difference between eight<br/>thousand and eleven thousand. It's as good as picking up three<br/>thousand; it's not so easy to find a purchaser, and I'm in<br/>desperate need of money. Only let me know it's serious, and I'll<br/>run over and fix it up. I'll snatch the time somehow. But what's<br/>the good of my galloping over, if it's all a notion of the<br/>priest's? Come, will you go?" "Oh, I can't spare the time. You must<br/>excuse me." "Come, you might oblige your father. I shan't forget<br/>it. You've no heart, any of you that's what it is! What's a day or<br/>two to you? Where are you going now- to Venice? Your Venice will<br/>keep another two days. I would have sent Alyosha, but what use is<br/>Alyosha in a thing like that? I send you just because you are a<br/>clever fellow. Do you suppose I don't see that? You know nothing<br/>about timber, but you've got an eye. All that is wanted is to see<br/>whether the man is in earnest. I tell you, watch his beard- if his<br/>beard shakes you know he is in earnest." "You force me to go to<br/>that damned Tchermashnya yourself, then?" cried Ivan, with a<br/>malignant smile. Fyodor Pavlovitch did not catch, or would not<br/>catch, the malignancy, but he caught the smile. "Then you'll go,<br/>you'll go? I'll scribble the note for you at once." "I don't know<br/>whether I shall go. I don't know. I'll decide on the way."<br/>"Nonsense! Decide at once. My dear fellow, decide! If you settle<br/>the matter, write me a line; give it to the priest and he'll send<br/>it on to me at once. And I won't delay you more than that. You can<br/>go to Venice. The priest will give you horses back to Volovya<br/>station." The old man was quite delighted. He wrote the note, and<br/>sent for the horses. A light lunch was brought in, with brandy.<br/>When Fyodor Pavlovitch was pleased, he usually became expansive,<br/>but to-day he seemed to restrain himself. Of Dmitri, for instance,<br/>he did not say a word. He was quite unmoved by the parting, and<br/>seemed, in fact, at a loss for something to say. Ivan noticed this<br/>particularly. "He must be bored with me," he thought. Only when<br/>accompanying his son out on to the steps, the old man began to fuss<br/>about. He would have kissed him, but Ivan made haste to hold out<br/>his hand, obviously avoiding the kiss. His father saw it at once,<br/>and instantly pulled himself up. "Well, good luck to you, good luck<br/>to you!" he repeated from the steps. "You'll come again some time<br/>or other? Mind you do come. I shall always be glad to see you.<br/>Well, Christ be with you!" Ivan got into the carriage. "Good-bye,<br/>Ivan! Don't be too hard on me!" the father called for the last<br/>time. The whole household came out to take leave- Smerdyakov, Marfa<br/>and Grigory. Ivan gave them ten roubles each. When he had seated<br/>himself in the carriage, Smerdyakov jumped up to arrange the rug.<br/>"You see… I am going to Tchermashnya," broke suddenly from Ivan.<br/>Again, as the day before, the words seemed to drop of themselves,<br/>and he laughed, too, a peculiar, nervous laugh. He remembered it<br/>long after. "It's a true saying then, that 'it's always worth while<br/>speaking to a clever man,'" answered Smerdyakov firmly, looking<br/>significantly at Ivan. The carriage rolled away. Nothing was clear<br/>in Ivan's soul, but he looked eagerly around him at the fields, at<br/>the hills, at the trees, at a flock of geese flying high overhead<br/>in the bright sky. And all of a sudden he felt very happy. He tried<br/>to talk to the driver, and he felt intensely interested in an<br/>answer the peasant made him; but a minute later he realised that he<br/>was not catching anything, and that he had not really even taken in<br/>the peasant's answer. He was silent, and it was pleasant even so.<br/>The air was pure and cool, sky bright. The images of Alyosha and<br/>Katerina Ivanovna floated into his mind. But he softly smiled, blew<br/>softly on the friendly phantoms, and they flew away. "There's<br/>plenty of time for them," he thought. They reached the station<br/>quickly, changed horses, and galloped to Volovya "Why is it worth<br/>while speaking to a clever man? What did he mean by that?" The<br/>thought seemed suddenly to clutch at his breathing. "And why did I<br/>tell him I was going to Tchermashnya?" They reached Volovya<br/>station. Ivan got out of the carriage, and the drivers stood round<br/>him bargaining over the journey of twelve versts to Tchermashnya.<br/>He told them to harness the horses. He went into the station house,<br/>looked round, glanced at the overseer's wife, and suddenly went<br/>back to the entrance. "I won't go to Tchermashnya. Am I too late to<br/>reach the railway by seven, brothers?" "We shall just do it. Shall<br/>we get the carriage out?" "At once. Will any one of you be going to<br/>the town to-morrow?" "To be sure. Mitri here will." "Can you do me<br/>a service, Mitri? Go to my father's, to Fyodor Pavlovitch<br/>Karamazov, and tell him I haven't gone to Tchermashnya. Can you?"<br/>"Of course I can. I've known Fyodor Pavlovitch a long time." "And<br/>here's something for you, for I dare say he won't give you<br/>anything," said Ivan, laughing gaily. "You may depend on it he<br/>won't." Mitri laughed too. "Thank you, sir. I'll be sure to do it."<br/>At seven o'clock Ivan got into the train and set off to Moscow.<br/>"Away with the past. I've done with the old world for ever, and may<br/>I have no news, no echo, from it. To a new life, new places, and no<br/>looking back!" But instead of delight his soul was filled with such<br/>gloom, and his heart ached with such anguish, as he had never known<br/>in his life before. He was thinking all the night. The train flew<br/>on, and only at daybreak, when he was approaching Moscow, he<br/>suddenly roused himself from his meditation. "I am a scoundrel," he<br/>whispered to himself. Fyodor Pavlovitch remained well satisfied at<br/>having seen his son off. For two hours afterwards he felt almost<br/>happy, and sat drinking brandy. But suddenly something happened<br/>which was very annoying and unpleasant for everyone in the house,<br/>and completely upset Fyodor Pavlovitch's equanimity at once.<br/>Smerdyakov went to the cellar for something and fell down from the<br/>top of the steps. Fortunately, Marfa Ignatyevna was in the yard and<br/>heard him in time. She did not see the fall, but heard his scream-<br/>the strange, peculiar scream, long familiar to her- the scream of<br/>the epileptic falling in a fit. They could not tell whether the fit<br/>had come on him at the moment he was decending the steps, so that<br/>he must have fallen unconscious, or whether it was the fall and the<br/>shock that had caused the fit in Smerdyakov, who was known to be<br/>liable to them. They found him at the bottom of the cellar steps,<br/>writhing in convulsions and foaming at the mouth. It was thought at<br/>first that he must have broken something- an arm or a leg- and hurt<br/>himself, but "God had preserved him," as Marfa Ignatyevna expressed<br/>it- nothing of the kind had happened. But it was difficult to get<br/>him out of the cellar. They asked the neighbours to help and<br/>managed it somehow. Fyodor Pavlovitch himself was present at the<br/>whole ceremony. He helped, evidently alarmed and upset. The sick<br/>man did not regain consciousness; the convulsions ceased for a<br/>time, but then began again, and everyone concluded that the same<br/>thing would happen, as had happened a year before, when he<br/>accidently fell from the garret. They remembered that ice been put<br/>on his head then. There was still ice in the cellar, and Marfa<br/>Ignatyevna had some brought up. In the evening, Fyodor Pavlovitch<br/>sent for Doctor Herzenstube, who arrived at once. He was a most<br/>estimable old man, and the most careful and conscientious doctor in<br/>the province. After careful examination, he concluded that the fit<br/>was a very violent one and might have serious consequences; that<br/>meanwhile he, Herzenstube, did not fully understand it, but that by<br/>to-morrow morning, if the present remedies were unavailing, he<br/>would venture to try something else. The invalid was taken to the<br/>lodge, to a room next to Grigory's and Marfa Ignatyevna's. Then<br/>Fyodor Pavlovitch had one misfortune after another to put up with<br/>that day. Marfa Ignatyevna cooked the dinner, and the soup,<br/>compared with Smerdyakov's, was "no better than dish-water," and<br/>the fowl was so dried up that it was impossible to masticate it. To<br/>her master's bitter, though deserved, reproaches, Marfa Ignatyevna<br/>replied that the fowl was a very old one to begin with, and that<br/>she had never been trained as a cook. In the evening there was<br/>another trouble in store for Fyodor Pavlovitch; he was informed<br/>that Grigory, who had not been well for the last three days, was<br/>completely laid up by his lumbago. Fyodor Pavlovitch finished his<br/>tea as early as possible and locked himself up alone in the house.<br/>He was in terrible excitement and suspense. That evening he<br/>reckoned on Grushenka's coming almost as a certainty. He had<br/>received from Smerdyakov that morning an assurance "that she had<br/>promised to come without fail." The incorrigible old man's heart<br/>throbbed with excitement; he paced up and down his empty rooms<br/>listening. He had to be on the alert. Dmitri might be on the watch<br/>for her somewhere, and when she knocked on the window (Smerdyakov<br/>had informed him two days before that he had told her where and how<br/>to knock) the door must be opened at once. She must not be a second<br/>in the passage, for fear which God forbid!- that she should be<br/>frightened and run away. Fyodor Pavlovitch had much to think of,<br/>but never had his heart been steeped in such voluptuous hopes. This<br/>time he could say almost certainly that she would come!<br/><br/><br/><br/>
