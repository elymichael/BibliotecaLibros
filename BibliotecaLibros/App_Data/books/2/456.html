repeated the doctor, perplexed. "He<br/>hears the bell, but where it is he cannot tell. Good-bye, we shall<br/>meet in Syracuse." "Who's this? Who's this?" The doctor flew into a<br/>terrible rage. "He is a schoolboy, doctor, he is a mischievous boy;<br/>take no notice of him," said Alyosha, frowning and speaking<br/>quickly. "Kolya, hold your tongue!" he cried to Krassotkin. "Take<br/>no notice of him, doctor," he repeated, rather impatiently. "He<br/>wants a thrashing, a good thrashing!" The doctor stamped in a<br/>perfect fury. "And you know, apothecary, my Perezvon might bite!"<br/>said Kolya, turning pale, with quivering voice and flashing eyes.<br/>"Ici, Perezvon!" "Kolya, if you say another word, I'll have nothing<br/>more to do with you," Alyosha cried peremptorily. "There is only<br/>one man in the world who can command Nikolay Krassotkin- this is<br/>the man," Kolya pointed to Alyosha. "I obey him, good-bye!" He<br/>stepped forward, opened the door, and quickly went into the inner<br/>room. Perezvon flew after him. The doctor stood still for five<br/>seconds in amazement, looking at Alyosha; then, with a curse, he<br/>went out quickly to the carriage, repeating aloud, "This is… this<br/>is… I don't know what it is!" The captain darted forward to help<br/>him into the carriage. Alyosha followed Kolya into the room. He was<br/>already by Ilusha's bedside. The sick boy was holding his hand and<br/>calling for his father. A minute later the captain, too, came back.<br/>"Father, father, come… we… " Ilusha faltered in violent excitement,<br/>but apparently unable to go on, he flung his wasted arms, found his<br/>father and Kolya, uniting them in one embrace, and hugging them as<br/>tightly as he could. The captain suddenly began to shake with dumb<br/>sobs, and Kolya's lips and chin twitched. "Father, father! How<br/>sorry I am for you!" Ilusha moaned bitterly. "Ilusha… darling… the<br/>doctor said… you would be all right… we shall be happy… the doctor…<br/>" the captain began. "Ah, father! I know what the new doctor said<br/>to you about me… . I saw!" cried Ilusha, and again he hugged them<br/>both with all his strength, hiding his face on his father's<br/>shoulder. "Father, don't cry, and when I die get a good boy,<br/>another one… choose one of them all, a good one, call him Ilusha<br/>and love him instead of me… " "Hush, old man, you'll get well,"<br/>Krassotkin cried suddenly, in a voice that sounded angry. "But<br/>don't ever forget me, father," Ilusha went on, "come to my grave…<br/>and father, bury me by our big stone, where we used to go for our<br/>walk, and come to me there with Krassotkin in the evening… and<br/>Perezvon… I shall expect you… . Father, father!" His voice broke.<br/>They were all three silent, still embracing. Nina was crying,<br/>quietly in her chair, and at last seeing them all crying, "mamma,"<br/>too, burst into tears. "Ilusha! Ilusha!" she exclaimed. Krassotkin<br/>suddenly released himself from Ilusha's embrace. "Good-bye, old<br/>man, mother expects me back to dinner," he said quickly. "What a<br/>pity I did not tell her! She will be dreadfully anxious… But after<br/>dinner I'll come back to you for the whole day, for the whole<br/>evening, and I'll tell you all sorts of things, all sorts of<br/>things. And I'll bring Perezvon, but now I will take him with me,<br/>because he will begin to howl when I am away and bother you.<br/>Good-bye! And he ran out into the passage. He didn't want to cry,<br/>but in the passage he burst into tears. Alyosha found him crying.<br/>"Kolya, you must be sure to keep your word and come, or he will be<br/>terribly disappointed," Alyosha said emphatically. "I will! Oh, how<br/>I curse myself for not having come before" muttered Kolya, crying,<br/>and no longer ashamed of it. At that moment the captain flew out of<br/>the room, and at once closed the door behind him. His face looked<br/>frenzied, his lips were trembling. He stood before the two and<br/>flung up his arms. "I don't want a good boy! I don't want another<br/>boy!" he muttered in a wild whisper, clenching his teeth. "If I<br/>forget thee, knees before the wooden bench. Pressing his fists<br/>against his head, he began sobbing with absurd whimpering cries,<br/>doing his utmost that his cries should not be heard in the room.<br/>Kolya ran out into the street. "Good-bye, Karamazov? Will you come<br/>yourself?" he cried sharply and angrily to Alyosha. "I will<br/>certainly come in the evening." "What was that he said about<br/>Jerusalem?… What did he mean by that?" "It's from the Bible. 'If I<br/>forget thee, Jerusalem,' that is, if I forget all that is most<br/>precious to me, if I let anything take its place, then may-" "I<br/>understand, that's enough! Mind you come! Ici, Perezvon!" he cried<br/>with positive ferocity to the dog, and with rapid strides he went<br/>home.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
