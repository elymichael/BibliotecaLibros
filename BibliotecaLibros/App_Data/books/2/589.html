<br/>"It's all right, it's all right, don't be anxious about him! she<br/>began again, sharply and stubbornly. "All that is only momentary, I<br/>know him, I know his heart only too well. You may be sure he will<br/>consent to escape. It's not as though it would be immediately; he<br/>will have time to make up his mind to it. Ivan Fyodorovitch will be<br/>well by that time and will manage it all himself, so that I shall<br/>have nothing to do with it. Don't be anxious; he will consent to<br/>run away. He has agreed already: do you suppose he would give up<br/>that creature? And they won't let her go to him, so he is bound to<br/>escape. It's you he's most afraid of, he is afraid you won't<br/>approve of his escape on moral grounds. But you must generously<br/>allow it, if your sanction is so necessary," Katya added viciously.<br/>She paused and smiled.<br/><br/>"He talks about some hymn," she went on again, "some cross he<br/>has to bear, some duty; I remember Ivan Fyodorovitch told me a<br/>great deal about it, and if you knew how he talked! Katya cried<br/>suddenly, with feeling she could not repress, "If you knew how he<br/>loved that wretched man at the moment he told me, and how he hated<br/>him, perhaps, at the same moment. And I heard his story and his<br/>tears with sneering disdain. Brute! Yes, I am a brute. I am<br/>responsible for his fever. But that man in prison is incapable of<br/>suffering," Katya concluded irritably. "Can such a man suffer? Men<br/>like him never suffer!" There was a note of hatred and contemptuous<br/>repulsion in her words. And yet it was she who had betrayed him.<br/>"Perhaps because she feels how she's wronged him she hates him at<br/>moments," Alyosha thought to himself. He hoped that it was only "at<br/>moments." In Katya's last words he detected a challenging note, but<br/>he did not take it up.<br/><br/>"I sent for you this morning to make you promise to persuade him<br/>yourself. Or do you, too, consider that to escape would be<br/>dishonourable, cowardly, or something… unchristian, perhaps?" Katya<br/>added, even more defiantly.<br/><br/>"Oh, no. I'll tell him everything," muttered Alyosha. "He asks<br/>you to come and see him to-day," he blurted out suddenly, looking<br/>her steadily in the face. She started, and drew back a little from<br/>him on the sofa.<br/><br/>"Me? Can that be?" She faltered, turning pale.<br/><br/>"It can and ought to be!" Alyosha began emphatically, growing<br/>more animated. "He needs you particularly just now. I would not<br/>have opened the subject and worried you, if it were not necessary.<br/>He is ill, he is beside himself, he keeps asking for you. It is not<br/>to be reconciled with you that he wants you, but only that you<br/>would go and show yourself at his door. So much has happened to him<br/>since that day. He realises that he has injured you beyond all<br/>reckoning. He does not ask your forgiveness- 'It's impossible to<br/>forgive me,' he says himself- but only that you would show yourself<br/>in his doorway."<br/><br/>"It's so sudden… " faltered Katya. "I've had a presentiment all<br/>these days that you would come with that message. I knew he would<br/>ask me to come. It's impossible!"<br/><br/>"Let it be impossible, but do it. Only think, he realises for<br/>the first time how he has wounded you, the first time in his life;<br/>he had never grasped it before so fully. He said, 'If she refuses<br/>to come I shall be unhappy all my life.' you hear? though he is<br/>condemned to penal servitude for twenty years, he is still planning<br/>to be happy- is not that piteous? Think- you must visit him; though<br/>he is ruined, he is innocent," broke like a challenge from Alyosha.<br/>"His hands are clean, there is no blood on them! For the sake of<br/>his infinite sufferings in the future visit him now. Go, greet him<br/>on his way into the darkness- stand at his door, that is all… . You<br/>ought to do it, you ought to!" Alyosha concluded, laying immense<br/>stress on the word "ought."<br/><br/>"I ought to… but I cannot… " Katya moaned. "He will look at me…<br/>. I can't."<br/><br/>"Your eyes ought to meet. How will you live all your life, if<br/>you don't make up your mind to do it now?"<br/><br/>
