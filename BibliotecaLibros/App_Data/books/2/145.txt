"In a theatre? What? What do you mean?" exclaimed Katerina
Ivanovna, profoundly astonished, flushing crimson, and
frowning.

"Though you assure him you are sorry to lose a friend in him,
you persist in telling him to his face that it's fortunate he is
going," said Alyosha breathlessly. He was standing at the table and
did not sit down.

"What are you talking about? I don't understand."

"I don't understand myself… . I seemed to see in a flash… I know
I am not saying it properly, but I'll say it all the same," Alyosha
went on in the same shaking and broken voice. "What I see is that
perhaps you don't love Dmitri at all… and never have, from the
beginning… . And Dmitri, too, has never loved you… and only esteems
you… . I really don't know how I dare to say all this, but somebody
must tell the truth… for nobody here will tell the truth."

"What truth?" cried Katerina Ivanovna,and there was an
hysterical ring in her voice.

"I'll tell you," Alyosha went on with desperate haste, as though
he were jumping from the top of a house. "Call Dmitri; I will fetch
him and let him come here and take your hand and take Ivan's and
join your hands. For you're torturing Ivan, simply because you love
him- and torturing him, because you love Dmitri through
'self-laceration'-with an unreal love- because you've persuaded
yourself."

Alyosha broke off and was silent.

"You… you… you are a little religious idiot- that's what you
are!" Katerina Ivanovna snapped. Her face was white and her lips
were moving with anger.

Ivan suddenly laughed and got up. His hat was in his hand.

"You are mistaken, my good Alyosha," he said, with an expression
Alyosha had never seen in his face before- an expression of
youthful sincerity and strong, irresistibly frank feeling.
"Katerina Ivanovna has never cared for me! She has known all the
time that I cared for her- though I never said a word of my love to
her- she knew, but she didn't care for me. I have never been her
friend either, not for one moment; she is too proud to need my
friendship. She kept me at her side as a means of revenge. She
revenged with me and on me all the insults which she has been
continually receiving from Dmitri ever since their first meeting.
For even that first meeting has rankled in her heart as an insult-
that's what her heart is like! She has talked to me of nothing but
her love for him. I am going now; but, believe me, Katerina
Ivanovna, you really love him. And the more he insults you, the
more you love him- that's your 'laceration.' You love him just as
he is; you love him for insulting you. If he reformed, you'd give
him up at once and cease to love him. But you need him so as to
contemplate continually your heroic fidelity and to reproach him
for infidelity. And it all comes from your pride. Oh, there's a
great deal of humiliation and self-abasement about it, but it all
comes from pride… . I am too young and I've loved you too much. I
know that I ought not to say this, that it would be more dignified
on my part simply to leave you, and it would be less offensive for
you. But I am going far away, and shall never come back… . It is
for ever. I don't want to sit beside a 'laceration.'… But I don't
know how to speak now. I've said everything… . Good-bye, Katerina
Ivanovna; you can't be angry with me, for I am a hundred times more
severely punished than you, if only by the fact that I shall never
see you again. Good-bye! I don't want your hand. You have tortured
me too deliberately for me to be able to forgive you at this
moment. I shall forgive you later, but now I don't want your hand.
Den Dank, Dame, begehr ich nicht,"
