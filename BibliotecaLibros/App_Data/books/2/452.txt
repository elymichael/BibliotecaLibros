"In the first place I am not thirteen, but fourteen, fourteen in
a fortnight," he flushed angrily, "and in the second place I am at
a complete loss to understand what my age has to do with it? The
question is what are my convictions, not what is my age, isn't
it?"

"When you are older, you'll understand for yourself the
influence of age on convictions. I fancied, too, that you were not
expressing your own ideas," Alyosha answered serenely and modestly,
but Kolya interrupted him hotly:

"Come, you want obedience and mysticism. You must admit that the
Christian religion, for instance, has only been of use to the rich

isn't it?"

"Ah, I know where you read that, and I am sure someone told you
so!" cried Alyosha.

"I say, what makes you think I read it? And certainly no one
told so. I can think for myself… . I am not opposed to Christ, if
you like. He was a most humane person, and if He were alive to-day,
He would be found in the ranks of the revolutionists, and would
perhaps play a conspicuous part… . There's no doubt about
that."

"Oh, where, where did you get that from? What fool have you made
friends with?" exclaimed Alyosha.

"Come, the truth will out! It has so chanced that I have often
talked to Mr. Rakitin, of course, but… old Byelinsky said that,
too, so they say."

"Byelinsky? I don't remember. He hasn't written that
anywhere."

"If he didn't write it, they say he said it. I heard that from
a… but never mind."

"And have you read Byelinsky?"

"Well, no… I haven't read all of him, but… I read the passage
about Tatyana, why she didn't go off with Onyegin."
