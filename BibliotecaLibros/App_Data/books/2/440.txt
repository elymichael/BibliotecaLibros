"No… I came with Perezvon. I've got a dog now, called Perezvon.
A Slavonic name. He's out there… if I whistle, he'll run in. I've
brought a dog, too," he said, addressing Ilusha all at once. "Do
you remember Zhutchka, old man?" he suddenly fired the question at
him.

Ilusha's little face quivered. He looked with an agonised
expression at Kolya. Alyosha, standing at the door, frowned and
signed to Kolya not to speak of Zhutchka, but he did not or would
not notice.

"Where… is Zhutchka?" Ilusha asked in a broken voice.

"Oh well, my boy, your Zhutchka's lost and done for!"

Ilusha did not speak, but he fixed an intent gaze once more on
Kolya. Alyosha, catching Kolya's eye, signed to him vigourously
again, but he turned away his eyes pretending not to have
noticed.

"It must have run away and died somewhere. It must have died
after a meal like that," Kolya pronounced pitilessly, though he
seemed a little breathless. "But I've got a dog, Perezvon… A
Slavonic name… I've brought him to show you."

"I don't want him!" said Ilusha suddenly.

"No, no, you really must see him… it will amuse you. I brought
him on purpose… . He's the same sort of shaggy dog… . You allow me
to call in my dog, madam?" He suddenly addressed Madame Snegiryov,
with inexplicable excitement in his manner.

"I don't want him, I don't want him!" cried Ilusha, with a
mournful break in his voice. There was a reproachful light in his
eyes.

"You'd better," the captain started up from the chest by the
wall on which he had just sat down, "you'd better… another time,"
he muttered, but Kolya could not be restrained. He hurriedly
shouted to Smurov, "Open the door," and as soon as it was open, he
blew his whistle. Perezvon dashed headlong into the room.
