<br/>"No, I didn't believe it."<br/><br/>"Oh, you insupportable person, you are incorrigible."<br/><br/>"You see, I knew that you seemed to care for me, but I pretended<br/>to believe that you didn't care for me to make it easier for<br/>you."<br/><br/>"That makes it worse! Worse and better than all! Alyosha, I am<br/>awfully fond of you. Just before you came this morning, I tried my<br/>fortune. I decided I would ask you for my letter, and if you<br/>brought it out calmly and gave it to me (as might have been<br/>expected from you) it would mean that you did not love me at all,<br/>that you felt nothing, and were simply a stupid boy, good for<br/>nothing, and that I am ruined. But you left the letter at home and<br/>that cheered me. You left it behind on purpose, so as not to give<br/>it back, because you knew I would ask for it? That was it, wasn't<br/>it?"<br/><br/>"Ah, Lise, it was not so a bit. The letter is with me now, and<br/>it was this morning, in this pocket. Here it is."<br/><br/>Alyosha pulled the letter out laughing, and showed it her at a<br/>distance.<br/><br/>"But I am not going to give it to you. Look at it from<br/>here."<br/><br/>"Why, then you told a lie? You, a monk, told a lie!"<br/><br/>"I told a lie if you like," Alyosha laughed, too. "I told a lie<br/>so as not to give you back the letter. It's very precious to me,"<br/>he added suddenly, with strong feeling, and again he flushed. "It<br/>always will be, and I won't give it up to anyone!"<br/><br/>Lise looked at him joyfully. "Alyosha," she murmured again,<br/>"look at the door. Isn't mamma listening?"<br/><br/>
