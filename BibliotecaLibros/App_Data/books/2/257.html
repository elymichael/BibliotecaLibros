<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>1<br/>Kuzma Samsonov<br/><br/><br/>BUT Dmitri, to whom Grushenka, flying away to a new life, had<br/>left her last greetings, bidding him remember the hour of her love<br/>for ever, knew nothing of what had happened to her, and was at that<br/>moment in a condition of feverish agitation and activity. For the<br/>last two days he had been in such an inconceivable state of mind<br/>that he might easily have fallen ill with brain fever, as he said<br/>himself afterwards. Alyosha had not been able to find him the<br/>morning before, and Ivan had not succeeded in meeting him at the<br/>tavern on the same day. The people at his lodgings, by his orders,<br/>concealed his movements.<br/><br/>He had spent those two days literally rushing in all directions,<br/>"struggling with his destiny and trying to save himself," as he<br/>expressed it himself afterwards, and for some hours he even made a<br/>dash out of the town on urgent business, terrible as it was to him<br/>to lose sight of Grushenka for a moment. All this was explained<br/>afterwards in detail, and confirmed by documentary evidence; but<br/>for the present we will only note the most essential incidents of<br/>those two terrible days immediately preceding the awful catastrophe<br/>that broke so suddenly upon him.<br/><br/>Though Grushenka had, it is true, loved him for an hour,<br/>genuinely and sincerely, yet she tortured him sometimes cruelly and<br/>mercilessly. The worst of it was that he could never tell what she<br/>meant to do. To prevail upon her by force or kindness was also<br/>impossible: she would yield to nothing. She would only have become<br/>angry and turned away from him altogether, he knew that well<br/>already. He suspected, quite correctly, that she, too, was passing<br/>through an inward struggle, and was in a state of extraordinary<br/>indecision, that she was making up her mind to something, and<br/>unable to determine upon it. And so, not without good reason, he<br/>divined, with a sinking heart, that at moments she must simply hate<br/>him and his passion. And so, perhaps, it was, but what was<br/>distressing Grushenka he did not understand. For him the whole<br/>tormenting question lay between him and Fyodor Pavlovitch.<br/><br/>Here, we must note, by the way, one certain fact: he was firmly<br/>persuaded that Fyodor Pavlovitch would offer, or perhaps had<br/>offered, Grushenka lawful wedlock, and did not for a moment believe<br/>that the old voluptuary hoped to gain his object for three thousand<br/>roubles. Mitya had reached this conclusion from his knowledge of<br/>Grushenka and her character. That was how it was that he could<br/>believe at times that all Grushenka's uneasiness rose from not<br/>knowing which of them to choose, which was most to her<br/>advantage.<br/><br/>Strange to say, during those days it never occurred to him to<br/>think of the approaching return of the "officer," that is, of the<br/>man who had been such a fatal influence in Grushenka's life, and<br/>whose arrival she was expecting with such emotion and dread. It is<br/>true that of late Grushenka had been very silent about it. Yet he<br/>was perfectly aware of a letter she had received a month ago from<br/>her seducer, and had heard of it from her own lips. He partly knew,<br/>too, what the letter contained. In a moment of spite Grushenka had<br/>shown him that letter, but to her astonishment he attached hardly<br/>any consequence to it. It would be hard to say why this was.<br/>Perhaps, weighed down by all the hideous horror of his struggle<br/>with his own father for this woman, he was incapable of imagining<br/>any danger more terrible, at any rate for the time. He simply did<br/>not believe in a suitor who suddenly turned up again after five<br/>years' disappearance, still less in his speedy arrival. Moreover,<br/>in the "officer's" first letter which had been shown to Mitya, the<br/>possibility of his new rival's visit was very vaguely suggested.<br/>The letter was very indefinite, high-flown, and full of<br/>sentimentality. It must be noted that Grushenka had concealed from<br/>him the last lines of the letter, in which his return was alluded<br/>to more definitely. He had, besides, noticed at that moment, he<br/>remembered afterwards, a certain involuntary proud contempt for<br/>this missive from Siberia on Grushenka's face. Grushenka told him<br/>nothing of what had passed later between her and this rival; so<br/>that by degrees he had completely forgotten the officer's<br/>existence.<br/><br/>He felt that whatever might come later, whatever turn things<br/>might take, his final conflict with Fyodor Pavlovitch was close<br/>upon him, and must be decided before anything else. With a sinking<br/>heart he was expecting every moment Grushenka's decision, always<br/>believing that it would come suddenly, on the impulse of the<br/>moment. All of a sudden she would say to him: "Take me, I'm yours<br/>for ever," and it would all be over. He would seize her and bear<br/>her away at once to the ends of the earth. Oh, then he would bear<br/>her away at once, as far, far away as possible; to the farthest end<br/>of Russia, if not of the earth, then he would marry her, and settle<br/>down with her incognito, so that no one would know anything about<br/>them, there, here, or anywhere. Then, oh then, a new life would<br/>begin at once!<br/><br/>Of this different, reformed and "virtuous" life ("it must, it<br/>must be virtuous") he dreamed feverishly at every moment. He<br/>thirsted for that reformation and renewal. The filthy morass, in<br/>which he had sunk of his own free will, was too revolting to him,<br/>and, like very many men in such cases, he put faith above all in<br/>change of place. If only it were not for these people, if only it<br/>were not for these circumstances, if only he could fly away from<br/>this accursed place- he would be altogether regenerated, would<br/>enter on a new path. That was what he believed in, and what he was<br/>yearning for.<br/>
