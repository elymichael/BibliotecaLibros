"No, I didn't believe it."

"Oh, you insupportable person, you are incorrigible."

"You see, I knew that you seemed to care for me, but I pretended
to believe that you didn't care for me to make it easier for
you."

"That makes it worse! Worse and better than all! Alyosha, I am
awfully fond of you. Just before you came this morning, I tried my
fortune. I decided I would ask you for my letter, and if you
brought it out calmly and gave it to me (as might have been
expected from you) it would mean that you did not love me at all,
that you felt nothing, and were simply a stupid boy, good for
nothing, and that I am ruined. But you left the letter at home and
that cheered me. You left it behind on purpose, so as not to give
it back, because you knew I would ask for it? That was it, wasn't
it?"

"Ah, Lise, it was not so a bit. The letter is with me now, and
it was this morning, in this pocket. Here it is."

Alyosha pulled the letter out laughing, and showed it her at a
distance.

"But I am not going to give it to you. Look at it from
here."

"Why, then you told a lie? You, a monk, told a lie!"

"I told a lie if you like," Alyosha laughed, too. "I told a lie
so as not to give you back the letter. It's very precious to me,"
he added suddenly, with strong feeling, and again he flushed. "It
always will be, and I won't give it up to anyone!"

Lise looked at him joyfully. "Alyosha," she murmured again,
"look at the door. Isn't mamma listening?"
