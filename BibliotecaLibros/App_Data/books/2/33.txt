"It's at him," she said, pointing to Alyosha, with childish
vexation at herself for not being able to repress her mirth.

If anyone had looked at Alyosha standing a step behind the
elder, he would have caught a quick flush crimsoning his cheeks in
an instant. His eyes shone and he looked down.

"She has a message for you, Alexey Fyodorovitch. How are you?"
the mother went on, holding out her exquisitely gloved hand to
Alyosha.

The elder turned round and all at once looked attentively at
Alyosha. The latter went nearer to Lise and, smiling in a strangely
awkward way, held out his hand to her too. Lise assumed an
important air.

"Katerina Ivanovna has sent you this through me." She handed him
a little note. "She particularly begs you to go and see her as soon
as possible; that you will not fail her, but will be sure to
come."

"She asks me to go and see her? Me? What for?" Alyosha muttered
in great astonishment. His face at once looked anxious.

"Oh, it's all to do with Dmitri Fyodorovitch and- what has
happened lately," the mother explained hurriedly. "Katerina
Ivanovna has made up her mind, but she must see you about it… .
Why, of course, I can't say. But she wants to see you at once. And
you will go to her, of course. It is a Christian duty."

"I have only seen her once," Alyosha protested with the same
perplexity.

"Oh, she is such a lofty, incomparable creature If only for her
suffering… . Think what she has gone through, what she is enduring
now Think what awaits her! It's all terrible, terrible!

"Very well, I will come," Alyosha decided, after rapidly
scanning the brief, enigmatic note, which consisted of an urgent
entreaty that he would come, without any sort of explanation.
