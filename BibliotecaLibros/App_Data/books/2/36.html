"Yes. But could I endure such a life for long?" the lady went on<br/>fervently, almost frantically. "That's the chief question- that's<br/>my most agonising question. I shut my eyes and ask myself, 'Would<br/>you persevere long on that path? And if the patient whose wounds<br/>you are washing did not meet you with gratitude, but worried you<br/>with his whims, without valuing or remarking your charitable<br/>services, began abusing you and rudely commanding you, and<br/>complaining to the superior authorities of you (which often happens<br/>when people are in great suffering)- what then? Would you persevere<br/>in your love, or not?' And do you know, I came with horror to the<br/>conclusion that, if anything could dissipate my love to humanity,<br/>it would be ingratitude. In short, I am a hired servant, I expect<br/>my payment at once- that is, praise, and the repayment of love with<br/>love. Otherwise I am incapable of loving anyone.'"<br/><br/>She was in a very paroxysm of self-castigation, and, concluding,<br/>she looked with defiant resolution at the elder.<br/><br/>"It's just the same story as a doctor once told me," observed<br/>the elder. "He was a man getting on in years, and undoubtedly<br/>clever. He spoke as frankly as you, though in jest, in bitter jest.<br/>'I love humanity,' he said, 'but I wonder at myself. The more I<br/>love humanity in general, the less I love man in particular. In my<br/>dreams,' he said, 'I have often come to making enthusiastic schemes<br/>for the service of humanity, and perhaps I might actually have<br/>faced crucifixion if it had been suddenly necessary; and yet I am<br/>incapable of living in the same room with anyone for two days<br/>together, as I know by experience. As soon as anyone is near me,<br/>his personality disturbs my self-complacency and restricts my<br/>freedom. In twenty-four hours I begin to hate the best of men: one<br/>because he's too long over his dinner; another because he has a<br/>cold and keeps on blowing his nose. I become hostile to people the<br/>moment they come close to me. But it has always happened that the<br/>more I detest men individually the more ardent becomes my love for<br/>humanity.'<br/><br/>"But what's to be done? What can one do in such a case? Must one<br/>despair?"<br/><br/>"No. It is enough that you are distressed at it. Do what you<br/>can, and it will be reckoned unto you. Much is done already in you<br/>since you can so deeply and sincerely know yourself. If you have<br/>been talking to me so sincerely, simply to gain approbation for<br/>your frankness, as you did from me just now, then, of course, you<br/>will not attain to anything in the achievement of real love; it<br/>will all get no further than dreams, and your whole life will slip<br/>away like a phantom. In that case you will naturally cease to think<br/>of the future life too, and will of yourself grow calmer after a<br/>fashion in the end."<br/><br/>"You have crushed me! Only now, as you speak, I understand that<br/>I was really only seeking your approbation for my sincerity when I<br/>told you I could not endure ingratitude. You have revealed me to<br/>myself. You have seen through me and explained me to myself<br/><br/>"Are you speaking the truth? Well, now, after such a confession,<br/>I believe that you are sincere and good at heart. If you do not<br/>attain happiness, always remember that you are on the right road,<br/>and try not to leave it. Above all, avoid falsehood, every kind of<br/>falsehood, especially falseness to yourself. Watch over your own<br/>deceitfulness and look into it every hour, every minute. Avoid<br/>being scornful, both to others and to yourself. What seems to you<br/>bad within you will grow purer from the very fact of your observing<br/>it in yourself. Avoid fear, too, though fear is only the<br/>consequence of every sort of falsehood. Never be frightened at your<br/>own faint-heartedness in attaining love. Don't be frightened<br/>overmuch even at your evil actions. I am sorry I can say nothing<br/>more consoling to you, for love in action is a harsh and dreadful<br/>thing compared with love in dreams. Love in dreams is greedy for<br/>immediate action, rapidly performed and in the sight of all. Men<br/>will even give their lives if only the ordeal does not last long<br/>but is soon over, with all looking on and applauding as though on<br/>the stage. But active love is labour and fortitude, and for some<br/>people too, perhaps, a complete science. But I predict that just<br/>when you see with horror that in spite of all your efforts you are<br/>getting farther from your goal instead of nearer to it- at that<br/>very moment I predict that you will reach it and behold clearly the<br/>miraculous power of the Lord who has been all the time loving and<br/>mysteriously guiding you. Forgive me for not being able to stay<br/>longer with you. They are waiting for me. Good-bye."<br/><br/>The lady was weeping.<br/><br/>"Lise, Lise! Bless her- bless her!" she cried, starting up<br/>suddenly.<br/><br/>"She does not deserve to be loved. I have seen her naughtiness<br/>all along," the elder said jestingly. "Why have you been laughing<br/>at Alexey?"<br/><br/>Lise had in fact been occupied in mocking at him all the time.<br/>She had noticed before that Alyosha was shy and tried not to look<br/>at her, and she found this extremely amusing. She waited intently<br/>to catch his eye. Alyosha, unable to endure her persistent stare,<br/>was irresistibly and suddenly drawn to glance at her, and at once<br/>she smiled triumphantly in his face. Alyosha was even more<br/>disconcerted and vexed. At last he turned away from her altogether<br/>and hid behind the elder's back. After a few minutes, drawn by the<br/>same irresistible force, he turned again to see whether he was<br/>being looked at or not, and found Lise almost hanging out of her<br/>chair to peep sideways at him, eagerly waiting for him to look.<br/>Catching his eye, she laughed so that the elder could not help<br/>saying, "Why do you make fun of him like that, naughty girl?"<br/>
