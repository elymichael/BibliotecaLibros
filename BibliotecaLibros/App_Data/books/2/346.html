<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>2<br/>The Alarm<br/><br/><br/>OUR police captain, Mihail Makarovitch Makarov, a retired<br/>lieutenant-colonel, was a widower and an excellent man. He had only<br/>come to us three years previously, but had won general esteem,<br/>chiefly because he "knew how to keep society together." He was<br/>never without visitors, and could not have got on without them.<br/>Someone or other was always dining with him; he never sat down to<br/>table without guests. He gave regular dinners, too, on all sorts of<br/>occasions, sometimes most surprising ones. Though the fare was not<br/>recherche, it was abundant. The fish-pies were excellent, and the<br/>wine made up in quantity for what it lacked in quality.<br/><br/>The first room his guests entered was a well fitted<br/>billiard-room, with pictures of English race horses, in black<br/>frames on the walls, an essential decoration, as we all know, for a<br/>bachelor's billiard-room. There was card playing every evening at<br/>his house, if only at one table. But at frequent intervals, all the<br/>society of our town, with the mammas and young ladies, assembled at<br/>his house to dance. Mihail Makarovitch was a widower, he did not<br/>live alone. His widowed daughter lived with him, with her two<br/>unmarried daughters, grown-up girls, who had finished their<br/>education. They were of agreeable appearance and lively character,<br/>and though everyone knew they would have no dowry, they attracted<br/>all the young men of fashion to their grandfather's house.<br/><br/>Mihail Makarovitch was by no means very efficient in his work,<br/>though he performed his duties no worse than many others. To speak<br/>plainly, he was a man of rather narrow education. His understanding<br/>of the limits of his administrative power could not always be<br/>relied upon. It was not so much that he failed to grasp certain<br/>reforms enacted during the present reign, as that he made<br/>conspicuous blunders in his interpretation of them. This was not<br/>from any special lack of intelligence, but from carelessness, for<br/>he was always in to great a hurry to go into the subject.<br/><br/>"I have the heart of a soldier rather than of a civilian," he<br/>used to say of himself. He had not even formed a definite idea of<br/>the fundamental principles of the reforms connected with the<br/>emancipation of the serfs, and only picked it up, so to speak, from<br/>year to year, involuntarily increasing his knowledge by practice.<br/>And yet he was himself a landowner. Pyotr Ilyitch knew for certain<br/>that he would meet some of Mihail Makarovitch's visitors there that<br/>evening, but he didn't know which. As it happened, at that moment<br/>the prosecutor, and Varvinsky, our district doctor, a young man,<br/>who had only just come to us from Petersburg after taking a<br/>brilliant degree at the Academy of Medicine, were playing whist at<br/>the police captain's. Ippolit Kirillovitch, the prosecutor (he was<br/>really the deputy prosecutor, but we always called him the<br/>prosecutor), was rather a peculiar man, of about five and thirty,<br/>inclined to be consumptive, and married to a fat and childless<br/>woman. He was vain and irritable, though he had a good intellect,<br/>and even a kind heart. It seemed that all that was wrong with him<br/>was that he had a better opinion of himself than his ability<br/>warranted. And that made him seem constantly uneasy. He had,<br/>moreover, certain higher, even artistic, leanings, towards<br/>psychology, for instance, a special study of the human heart, a<br/>special knowledge of the criminal and his crime. He cherished a<br/>grievance on this ground, considering that he had been passed over<br/>in the service, and being firmly persuaded that in higher spheres<br/>he had not been properly appreciated, and had enemies. In gloomy<br/>moments he even threatened to give up his post, and practise as a<br/>barrister in criminal cases. The unexpected Karamazov case agitated<br/>him profoundly: "It was a case that might well be talked about all<br/>over Russia." But I am anticipating.<br/><br/>Nikolay Parfenovitch Nelyudov, the young investigating lawyer,<br/>who had only come from Petersburg two months before, was sitting in<br/>the next room with the young ladies. People talked about it<br/>afterwards and wondered that all the gentlemen should, as though<br/>intentionally, on the evening of "the crime" have been gathered<br/>together at the house of the executive authority. Yet it was<br/>perfectly simple and happened quite naturally.<br/><br/>Ippolit Kirillovitch's wife had had toothache for the last two<br/>days, and he was obliged to go out to escape from her groans. The<br/>doctor, from the very nature of his being, could not spend an<br/>evening except at cards. Nikolay Parfenovitch Nelyudov had been<br/>intending for three days past to drop in that evening at Mihail<br/>Makarovitch's, so to speak casually, so as slyly to startle the<br/>eldest granddaughter, Olga Mihailovna, by showing that he knew her<br/>secret, that he knew it was her birthday, and that she was trying<br/>to conceal it on purpose, so as not to be obliged to give a dance.<br/>He anticipated a great deal of merriment, many playful jests about<br/>her age, and her being afraid to reveal it, about his knowing her<br/>secret and telling everybody, and so on. The charming young man was<br/>a great adept at such teasing; the ladies had christened him "the<br/>naughty man," and he seemed to be delighted at the name. He was<br/>extremely well-bred, however, of good family, education and<br/>feelings, and, though leading a life of pleasure, his sallies were<br/>always innocent and in good taste. He was short, and<br/>delicate-looking. On his white, slender, little fingers he always<br/>wore a number of big, glittering rings. When he was engaged in his<br/>official duties, he always became extraordinarily grave, as though<br/>realising his position and the sanctity of the obligations laid<br/>upon him. He had a special gift for mystifying murderers and other<br/>criminals of the peasant class during interrogation, and if he did<br/>not win their respect, he certainly succeeded in arousing their<br/>wonder.<br/><br/>Pyotr Ilyitch was simply dumbfounded when he went into the<br/>police captain's. He saw instantly that everyone knew. They had<br/>positively thrown down their cards, all were standing up and<br/>talking. Even Nikolay Parfenovitch had left the young ladies and<br/>run in, looking strenuous and ready for action. Pyotr Ilyitch was<br/>met with the astounding news that old Fyodor Pavlovitch really had<br/>been murdered that evening in his own house, murdered and robbed.<br/>The news had only just reached them in the following manner:<br/>
