<br/>"You may ask any question," the prosecutor replied with frigid<br/>severity, "any question relating to the facts of the case, and we<br/>are, I repeat, bound to answer every inquiry you make. We found the<br/>servant Smerdyakov, concerning whom you inquire, lying unconscious<br/>in his bed, in an epileptic fit of extreme severity, that had<br/>recurred, possibly, ten times. The doctor who was with us told us,<br/>after seeing him, that he may possibly not outlive the night."<br/><br/>"Well, if that's so, the devil must have killed him," broke<br/>suddenly from Mitya, as though until that moment had been asking<br/>himself: "Was it Smerdyakov or not?"<br/><br/>"We will come back to this later," Nikolay Parfenovitch decided.<br/>"Now wouldn't you like to continue your statement?"<br/><br/>Mitya asked for a rest. His request was courteously granted.<br/>After resting, he went on with his story. But he was evidently<br/>depressed. He was exhausted, mortified, and morally shaken. To make<br/>things worse the prosecutor exasperated him, as though<br/>intentionally, by vexatious interruptions about "trifling points."<br/>Scarcely had Mitya described how, sitting on the wall, he had<br/>struck Grigory on the head with the pestle, while the old man had<br/>hold of his left leg, and how he then jumped down to look at him,<br/>when the prosecutor stopped him to ask him to describe exactly how<br/>he was sitting on the wall. Mitya was surprised.<br/><br/>"Oh, I was sitting like this, astride, one leg on one side of<br/>the wall and one on the other."<br/><br/>"And the pestle?"<br/><br/>"The pestle was in my hand."<br/><br/>"Not in your pocket? Do you remember that precisely? Was it a<br/>violent blow you gave him?"<br/><br/>"It must have been a violent one. But why do you ask?"<br/><br/>"Would you mind sitting on the chair just as you sat on the wall<br/>then and showing us just how you moved your arm, and in what<br/>direction?"<br/><br/>
