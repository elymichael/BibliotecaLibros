<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>2<br/>At<br/>His Father's<br/><br/><br/>FIRST of all, Alyosha went to his father. On the way he<br/>remembered that his father had insisted the day before that he<br/>should come without his brother Ivan seeing him. "Why so?" Alyosha<br/>wondered suddenly. "Even if my father has something to say to me<br/>alone, why should I go in unseen? Most likely in his excitement<br/>yesterday he meant to say something different," he decided. Yet he<br/>was very glad when Marfa Ignatyevna, who opened the garden gate to<br/>him (Grigory, it appeared, was ill in bed in the lodge), told him<br/>in answer to his question that Ivan Fyodorovitch had gone out two<br/>hours ago.<br/><br/>"And my father?"<br/><br/>"He is up, taking his coffee," Marfa answered somewhat<br/>drily.<br/><br/>Alyosha went in. The old man was sitting alone at the table<br/>wearing slippers and a little old overcoat. He was amusing himself<br/>by looking through some accounts, rather inattentively however. He<br/>was quite alone in the house, for Smerdyakov too had gone out<br/>marketing. Though he had got up early and was trying to put a bold<br/>face on it, he looked tired and weak. His forehead, upon which huge<br/>purple bruises had come out during the night, was bandaged with a<br/>red handkerchief; his nose too was swollen terribly in the night,<br/>and some smaller bruises covered it in patches, giving his whole<br/>face a peculiarly spiteful and irritable look. The old man was<br/>aware of this, and turned a hostile glance on Alyosha as he came<br/>in.<br/><br/>"The coffee is cold," he cried harshly; "I won't offer you any.<br/>I've ordered nothing but a Lenten fish soup to-day, and I don't<br/>invite anyone to share it. Why have you come?"<br/><br/>"To find out how you are," said Alyosha.<br/><br/>"Yes. Besides, I told you to come yesterday. It's all of no<br/>consequence. You need not have troubled. But I knew you'd come<br/>poking in directly."<br/>
