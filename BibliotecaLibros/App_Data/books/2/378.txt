laid aside Mitya's cap, and decided that all his clothes must be

the right cuff of Mitya's shirt was turned in, and covered with
blood, "excuse me, what's that, blood?"

"Yes," Mitya jerked out.

Mitya told him how he had got the sleeve stained with blood
looking after Grigory, and had turned it inside when he was washing
his hands at Perhotin's.

"You must take off your shirt, too. That's very important as
material evidence."

Mitya flushed red and flew into a rage.

"What, am I to stay naked?" he shouted.

"Don't disturb yourself. We will arrange something. And
meanwhile take off your socks."

"You're not joking? Is that really necessary?"
