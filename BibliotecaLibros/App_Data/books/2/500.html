I want the truth, the truth!"<br/><br/>He drew a deep breath, looking angrily at Alyosha before his<br/>answer came.<br/><br/>"Forgive me, I did think that, too, at the time," whispered<br/>Alyosha, and he did not add one softening phrase.<br/><br/>"Thanks," snapped Ivan, and, leaving Alyosha, he went quickly on<br/>his way. From that time Alyosha noticed that Ivan began obviously<br/>to avoid him and seemed even to have taken a dislike to him, so<br/>much so that Alyosha gave up going to see him. Immediately after<br/>that meeting with him, Ivan had not gone home, but went straight to<br/>Smerdyakov again.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
