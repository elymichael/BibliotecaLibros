"You know of yourself, for a fact, that it wasn't I murdered
him. And I should have thought that there was no need for a
sensible man to speak of it again."

"But why, why had you such a suspicion about me at the
time?"

"As you know already, it was simply from fear. For I was in such
a position, shaking with fear, that I suspected everyone. I
resolved to sound you, too, for I thought if you wanted the same as
your brother, then the business was as good as settled and I should
be crushed like a fly, too."

"Look here, you didn't say that a fortnight ago."

"I meant the same when I talked to you in the hospital, only I
thought you'd understand without wasting words, and that being such
a sensible man you wouldn't care to talk of it openly."

"What next! Come answer, answer, I insist: what was itâ€¦ what
could I have done to put such a degrading suspicion into your mean
soul?"

"As for the murder, you couldn't have done that and didn't want
to, but as for wanting someone else to do it, that was just what
you did want."

"And how coolly, how coolly he speakst But why should I have
wanted it; what grounds had I for wanting it?"

"What grounds had you? What about the inheritance?" said
Smerdyakov sarcastically, and, as it were, vindictively. "Why,
after your parent's death there was at least forty thousand to come
to each of you, and very likely more, but if Fyodor Pavlovitch got
married then to that lady, Agrafena Alexandrovna, she would have
had all his capital made over to her directly after the wedding,
for she's plenty of sense, so that your parent would not have left
you two roubles between the three of you. And were they far from a
wedding, either? Not a hair's-breadth: that lady had only to lift
her little finger and he would have run after her to church, with
his tongue out."

Ivan restrained himself with painful effort.
