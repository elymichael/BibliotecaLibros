<br/>Meantime she had made Pyotr Ilyitch sit down and sat down<br/>herself, facing him briefly, but fairly clearly, Pyotr Ilyitch told<br/>her the history of the affair, that part of it at least which he<br/>had himself witnessed. He described, too, his visit to Fenya, and<br/>told her about the pestle. All these details produced an<br/>overwhelming effect on the distracted lady, who kept uttering<br/>shrieks, and covering her face with her hands…<br/><br/>"Would you believe it, I foresaw all this! I have that special<br/>faculty, whatever I imagine comes to pass. And how often I've<br/>looked at that awful man and always thought, that man will end by<br/>murdering me. And now it's happened… that is, if he hasn't murdered<br/>me, but only his own father, it's only because the finger of God<br/>preserved me, and what's more, he was ashamed to murder me because,<br/>in this very place, I put the holy ikon from the relics of the holy<br/>martyr, Saint Varvara, on his neck… . And to think how near I was<br/>to death at that minute I went close up to him and he stretched out<br/>his neck to me!… Do you know, Pyotr Ilyitch (I think you said your<br/>name was Pyotr Ilyitch), I don't believe in miracles, but that ikon<br/>and this unmistakable miracle with me now- that shakes me, and I'm<br/>ready to believe in anything you like. Have you heard about Father<br/>Zossima?… But I don't know what I'm saying… and only fancy, with<br/>the ikon on his neck he spat at me… . He only spat, it's true, he<br/>didn't murder me and… he dashed away! But what shall we do, what<br/>must we do now? What do you think?"<br/><br/>Pyotr Ilyitch got up, and announced that he was going straight<br/>to the police captain, to tell him all about it, and leave him to<br/>do what he thought fit.<br/><br/>"Oh, he's an excellent man, excellent! Mihail Makarovitch, I<br/>know him. Of course, he's the person to go to. How practical you<br/>are, Pyotr Ilyitch! How well you've thought of everything! I should<br/>never have thought of it in your place!"<br/><br/>"Especially as I know the police captain very well, too,"<br/>observed Pyotr Ilyitch, who still continued to stand, and was<br/>obviously anxious to escape as quickly as possible from the<br/>impulsive lady, who would not let him say good-bye and go away.<br/><br/>"And be sure, be sure," she prattled on, "to come back and tell<br/>me what you see there, and what you find out… what comes to light…<br/>how they'll try him… and what he's condemned to… . Tell me, we have<br/>no capital punishment, have we? But be sure to come, even if it's<br/>at three o'clock at night, at four, at half-past four… . Tell them<br/>to wake me, to wake me, to shake me, if I don't get up… . But, good<br/>heavens, I shan't sleep! But wait, hadn't I better come with<br/>you?"<br/><br/>"N-no. But if you would write three lines with your own hand,<br/>stating that you did not give Dmitri Fyodorovitch money, it might,<br/>perhaps, be of use… in case it's needed… "<br/><br/>"To be sure!" Madame Hohlakov skipped, delighted, to her bureau.<br/>"And you know I'm simply struck, amazed at your resourcefulness,<br/>your good sense in such affairs. Are you in the service here? I'm<br/>delighted to think that you're in the service here!"<br/><br/>And still speaking, she scribbled on half a sheet of notepaper<br/>the following lines:<br/><br/>I've never in my life lent to that unhappy man, Dmitri<br/>Fyodorovitch Karamazov (for, in spite of all, he is unhappy), three<br/>thousand roubles to-day. I've never given him money, never: That I<br/>swear by all thats holy! K. Hohlakov<br/><br/>
