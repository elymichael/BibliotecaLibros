"Listen, you miserable, contemptible creature! Don't you
understand that if I haven't killed you, it's simply because I am
keeping you to answer to-morrow at the trial. God sees," Ivan
raised his hand, "perhaps I, too, was guilty; perhaps I really had
a secret desire for my father'sâ€¦ death, but I swear I was not as
guilty as you think, and perhaps I didn't urge you on at all. No,
no, I didn't urge you on! But no matter, I will give evidence
against myself to-morrow at the trial. I'm determined to! I shall
tell everything, everything. But we'll make our appearance
together. And whatever you may say against me at the trial,
whatever evidence you give, I'll face it; I am not afraid of you.
I'll confirm it all myself! But you must confess, too! You must,
you must; we'll go together. That's how it shall be!"

Ivan said this solemnly and resolutely and from his flashing
eyes alone it could be seen that it would be so.

"You are ill, I see; you are quite ill. Your eyes are yellow,"
Smerdyakov commented, without the least irony, with apparent
sympathy in fact.

"We'll go together," Ivan repeated. "And if you won't go, no
matter, I'll go alone."

Smerdyakov paused as though pondering.

"There'll be nothing of the sort, and you won't go," he
concluded at last positively.

"You don't understand me," Ivan exclaimed reproachfully.

"You'll be too much ashamed, if you confess it all. And, what's
more, it will be no use at all, for I shall say straight out that I
never said anything of the sort to you, and that you are either ill
(and it looks like it, too), or that you're so sorry for your
brother that you are sacrificing yourself to save him and have
invented it all against me, for you've always thought no more of me
than if I'd been a fly. And who will believe you, and what single
proof have you got?"

"Listen, you showed me those notes just now to convince me."

Smerdyakov lifted the book off the notes and laid it on one
side.
