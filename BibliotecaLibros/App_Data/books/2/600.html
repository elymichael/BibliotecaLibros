<br/>Meantime they were strolling slowly along the path and suddenly<br/>Smurov exclaimed:<br/><br/>"There's Ilusha's stone, under which they wanted to bury<br/>him."<br/><br/>They all stood still by the big stone. Alyosha looked and the<br/>whole picture of what Snegiryov had described to him that day, how<br/>Ilusha, weeping and hugging his father, had cried, "Father, father,<br/>how he insulted you," rose at once before his imagination. A sudden<br/>impulse seemed to come into his soul. With a serious and earnest<br/>expression he looked from one to another of the bright, pleasant<br/>faces of Ilusha's schoolfellows, and suddenly said to them:<br/><br/>"Boys, I should like to say one word to you, here at this<br/>place."<br/><br/>The boys stood round him and at once bent attentive and<br/>expectant eyes upon him.<br/><br/>"Boys, we shall soon part. I shall be for some time with my two<br/>brothers, of whom one is going to Siberia and the other is lying at<br/>death's door. But soon I shall leave this town, perhaps for a long<br/>time, so we shall part. Let us make a compact here, at Ilusha's<br/>stone, that we will never forget Ilusha and one another.<br/><br/>And whatever happens to us later in life, if we don't meet for<br/>twenty years afterwards, let us always remember how we buried the<br/>poor boy at whom we once threw stones, do you remember, by the<br/>bridge? and afterwards we all grew so fond of him. He was a fine<br/>boy, a kindhearted, brave boy, he felt for his father's honour and<br/>resented the cruel insult to him and stood up for him. And so in<br/>the first place, we will remember him, boys, all our lives. And<br/>even if we are occupied with most important things, if we attain to<br/>honour or fall into great misfortune- still let us remember how<br/>good it was once here, when we were all together, united by a good<br/>and kind feeling which made us, for the time we were loving that<br/>poor boy, better perhaps than we are. My little doves let me call<br/>you so, for you are very like them, those pretty blue birds, at<br/>this minute as I look at your good dear faces. My dear children,<br/>perhaps you won't understand what I am saying to you, because I<br/>often speak very unintelligibly, but you'll remember all the same<br/>and will agree with my words some time. You must know that there is<br/>nothing higher and stronger and more wholesome and good for life in<br/>the future than some good memory, especially a memory of childhood,<br/>of home. People talk to you a great deal about your education, but<br/>some good, sacred memory, preserved from childhood, is perhaps the<br/>best education. If a man carries many such memories with him into<br/>life, he is safe to the end of his days, and if one has only one<br/>good memory left in one's heart, even that may sometime be the<br/>means of saving us. Perhaps we may even grow wicked later on, may<br/>be unable to refrain from a bad action, may laugh at men's tears<br/>and at those people who say as Kolya did just now, 'I want to<br/>suffer for all men,' and may even jeer spitefully at such people.<br/>But however bad we may become- which God forbid- yet, when we<br/>recall how we buried Ilusha, how we loved him in his last days, and<br/>how we have been talking like friends all together, at this stone,<br/>the cruellest and most mocking of us- if we do become so will not<br/>dare to laugh inwardly at having been kind and good at this moment!<br/>What's more, perhaps, that one memory may keep him from great evil<br/>and he will reflect and say, 'Yes, I was good and brave and honest<br/>then!' Let him laugh to himself, that's no matter, a man often<br/>laughs at what's good and kind. That's only from thoughtlessness.<br/>But I assure you, boys, that as he laughs he will say at once in<br/>his heart, 'No, I do wrong to laugh, for that's not a thing to<br/>laugh at.'<br/><br/>"That will be so, I understand you, Karamazov!" cried Kolya,<br/>with flashing eyes.<br/><br/>The boys were excited and they, too, wanted to say something,<br/>but they restrained themselves, looking with intentness and emotion<br/>at the speaker.<br/><br/>"I say this in case we become bad," Alyosha went on, "but<br/>there's no reason why we should become bad, is there, boys? Let us<br/>be, first and above all, kind, then honest and then let us never<br/>forget each other! I say that again. I give you my word for my part<br/>that I'll never forget one of you. Every face looking at me now I<br/>shall remember even for thirty years. Just now Kolya said to<br/>Kartashov that we did not care to know whether he exists or not.<br/>But I cannot forget that Kartashov exists and that he is not<br/>blushing now as he did when he discovered the founders of Troy, but<br/>is looking at me with his jolly, kind, dear little eyes. Boys, my<br/>dear boys, let us all be generous and brave like Ilusha, clever,<br/>brave and generous like Kolya (though he will be ever so much<br/>cleverer when he is grown up), and let us all be as modest, as<br/>clever and sweet as Kartashov. But why am I talking about those<br/>two? You are all dear to me, boys; from this day forth, I have a<br/>place in my heart for you all, and I beg you to keep a place in<br/>your hearts for me! Well, and who has united us in this kind, good<br/>feeling which we shall remember and intend to remember all our<br/>lives? Who, if not Ilusha, the good boy, the dear boy, precious to<br/>us for ever! Let us never forget him. May his memory live for ever<br/>in our hearts from this time forth!"<br/><br/>
