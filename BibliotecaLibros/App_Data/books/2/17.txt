"I know it's the other side of the copse," observed Fyodor
Pavlovitch, "but we don't remember the way. It is a long time since
we've been here."

"This way, by this gate, and straight across the copse… the
copse. Come with me, won't you? I'll show you. I have to go… . I am
going myself. This way, this way."

They came out of the gate and turned towards the copse. Maximov,
a man of sixty, ran rather than walked, turning sideways to stare
at them all, with an incredible degree of nervous curiosity. His
eyes looked starting out of his head.

"You see, we have come to the elder upon business of our own,"
observed Miusov severely. "That personage has granted us an
audience, so to speak, and so, though we thank you for showing us
the way, we cannot ask you to accompany us."

"I've been there. I've been already; un chevalier parfait," and
Maximov snapped his fingers in the air.

"Who is a chevalier?" asked Miusov.

"The elder, the splendid elder, the elder! The honour and glory
of the monastery, Zossima. Such an elder!"

But his incoherent talk was cut short by a very pale,
wan-looking monk of medium height wearing a monk's cap, who
overtook them. Fyodor Pavlovitch and Miusov stopped.

The monk, with an extremely courteous, profound bow,
announced:

"The Father Superior invites all of you gentlemen to dine with
him after your visit to the hermitage. At one o'clock, not later.
And you also," he added, addressing Maximov.
