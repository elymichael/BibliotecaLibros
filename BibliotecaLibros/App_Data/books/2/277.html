"You scream?" roared Mitya, "where is she?"<br/><br/>But without giving the terror-stricken Fenya time to utter a<br/>word, he fell all of a heap at her feet.<br/><br/>"Fenya, for Christ's sake, tell me, where is she?"<br/><br/>"I don't know. Dmitri Fyodorovitch, my dear, I don't know. You<br/>may kill me but I can't tell you." Fenya swore and protested. "You<br/>went out with her yourself not long ago-"<br/><br/>"She came back!"<br/><br/>"Indeed she didn't. By God I swear she didn't come back."<br/><br/>"You're lying!" shouted Mitya. "From your terror I know where<br/>she is."<br/><br/>He rushed away. Fenya in her fright was glad she had got off so<br/>easily. But she knew very well that it was only that he was in such<br/>haste, or she might not have fared so well. But as he ran, he<br/>surprised both Fenya and old Matryona by an unexpected action.

Mitya already had<br/>opened the door with one hand when, with the other, he snatched up<br/>the pestle, and thrust it in his side-pocket.<br/><br/>"Oh Lord! He's going to murder someone!" cried Fenya, flinging<br/>up her hands.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
