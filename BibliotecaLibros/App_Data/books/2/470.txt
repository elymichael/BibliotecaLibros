A
Little Demon


GOING in to Lise, he found her half reclining in the
invalid-chair, in which she had been wheeled when she was unable to
walk. She did not move to meet him, but her sharp, keen eyes were
simply riveted on his face. There was a feverish look in her eyes,
her face was pale and yellow. Alyosha was amazed at the change that
had taken place in her in three days. She was positively thinner.
She did not hold out her hand to him. He touched the thin, long
fingers which lay motionless on her dress, then he sat down facing
her, without a word.

"I know you are in a hurry to get to the prison," Lise said
curtly, "and mamma's kept you there for hours; she's just been
telling you about me and Yulia."

"How do you know?" asked Alyosha.

"I've been listening. Why do you stare at me? I want to listen
and I do listen, there's no harm in that. I don't apologise."

"You are upset about something?"

"On the contrary, I am very happy. I've only just been
reflecting for the thirtieth time what a good thing it is I refused
you and shall not be your wife. You are not fit to be a husband. If
I were to marry you and give you a note to take to the man I loved
after you, you'd take it and be sure to give it to him and bring an
answer back, too. If you were forty, you would still go on taking
my love-letters for me."

She suddenly laughed.
