<br/>"Ah, I dare say you are a connoisseur in that. But, look here,<br/>Fyodor Pavlovitch, you said just now that we had given our word to<br/>behave properly. Remember it. I advise you to control yourself.<br/>But, if you begin to play the fool I don't intend to be associated<br/>with you hereâ€¦ You see what a man he is"- he turned to the monk-<br/>"I'm afraid to go among decent people with him." A fine smile, not<br/>without a certain slyness, came on to the pale, bloodless lips of<br/>the monk, but he made no reply, and was evidently silent from a<br/>sense of his own dignity. Miusov frowned more than ever.<br/><br/>"Oh, devil take them all! An outer show elaborated through<br/>centuries, and nothing but charlatanism and nonsense underneath,"<br/>flashed through Miusov's mind.<br/><br/>"Here's the hermitage. We've arrived," cried Fyodor Pavlovitch.<br/>"The gates are shut."<br/><br/>And he repeatedly made the sign of the cross to the saints<br/>painted above and on the sides of the gates.<br/><br/>"When you go to Rome you must do as the Romans do. Here in this<br/>hermitage there are twenty-five saints being saved. They look at<br/>one another, and eat cabbages. And not one woman goes in at this<br/>gate. That's what is remarkable. And that really is so. But I did<br/>hear that the elder receives ladies," he remarked suddenly to the<br/>monk.<br/><br/>"Women of the people are here too now, lying in the portico<br/>there waiting. But for ladies of higher rank two rooms have been<br/>built adjoining the portico, but outside the precincts you can see<br/>the windows- and the elder goes out to them by an inner passage<br/>when he is well enough. They are always outside the precincts.<br/>There is a Harkov lady, Madame Hohlakov, waiting there now with her<br/>sick daughter. Probably he has promised to come out to her, though<br/>of late he has been so weak that he has hardly shown himself even<br/>to the people."<br/><br/>"So then there are loopholes, after all, to creep out of the<br/>hermitage to the ladies. Don't suppose, holy father, that I mean<br/>any harm. But do you know that at Athos not only the visits of<br/>women are not allowed, but no creature of the female sex- no hens,<br/>nor turkey hens, nor cows."<br/><br/>"Fyodor Pavlovitch, I warn you I shall go back and leave you<br/>here. They'll turn you out when I'm gone."<br/><br/>"But I'm not interfering with you, Pyotr Alexandrovitch. Look,"<br/>he cried suddenly, stepping within the precincts, "what a vale of<br/>roses they live in!"<br/><br/>Though there were no roses now, there were numbers of rare and<br/>beautiful autumn flowers growing wherever there was space for them,<br/>and evidently tended by a skilful hand; there were flower-beds<br/>round the church, and between the tombs; and the one-storied wooden<br/>house where the elder lived was also surrounded with flowers.<br/><br/>
