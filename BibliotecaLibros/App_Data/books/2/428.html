"But his name<br/>wasn't Trifon.

"Alexey Ivanitch is his name. Tchizhov, Alexey<br/>Ivanitch."<br/><br/>"Not a doubt about it, it's Tchizhov," a fourth woman<br/>emphatically confirmed the statement.<br/><br/>The bewildered youth gazed from one to another.<br/><br/>"But what did he ask for, what did he ask for, good people?" he<br/>cried almost in desperation."

Tell me, if you know."<br/><br/>"That tall, snivelling fellow who used to sit in the market in<br/>the summer."<br/><br/>
