<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>3<br/>Conversations and Exhortations of Father Zossima<br/><br/><br/>(e) The Russian Monk and his possible Significance.<br/><br/>FATHERS and teachers, what is the monk? In the cultivated world<br/>the word is nowadays pronounced by some people with a jeer, and by<br/>others it is used as a term of abuse, and this contempt for the<br/>monk is growing. It is true, alas, it is true, that there are many<br/>sluggards, gluttons, profligates, and insolent beggars among monks.<br/>Educated people point to these: "You are idlers, useless members of<br/>society, you live on the labour of others, you are shameless<br/>beggars." And yet how many meek and humble monks there are,<br/>yearning for solitude and fervent prayer in peace! These are less<br/>noticed, or passed over in silence. And how suprised men would be<br/>if I were to say that from these meek monks, who yearn for solitary<br/>prayer, the salvation of Russia will come perhaps once more! For<br/>they are in truth made ready in peace and quiet "for the day and<br/>the hour, the month and the year." Meanwhile, in their solitude,<br/>they keep the image of Christ fair and undefiled, in the purity of<br/>God's truth, from the times of the Fathers of old, the Apostles and<br/>the martyrs. And when the time comes they will show it to the<br/>tottering creeds of the world. That is a great thought. That star<br/>will rise out of the East.<br/><br/>That is my view of the monk, and is it false? Is it too proud?<br/>Look at the worldly and all who set themselves up above the people<br/>of God; has not God's image and His truth been distorted in them?<br/>They have science; but in science there is nothing but what is the<br/>object of sense. The spiritual world, the higher part of man's<br/>being is rejected altogether, dismissed with a sort of triumph,<br/>even with hatred. The world has proclaimed the reign of freedom,<br/>especially of late, but what do we see in this freedom of theirs?<br/>Nothing but slavery and self-destruction! For the world says:<br/><br/>"You have desires and so satisfy them, for you have the same<br/>rights as the most rich and powerful. Don't be afraid of satisfying<br/>them and even multiply your desires." That is the modern doctrine<br/>of the world. In that they see freedom. And what follows from this<br/>right of multiplication of desires? In the rich, isolation and<br/>spiritual suicide; in the poor, envy and murder; for they have been<br/>given rights, but have not been shown the means of satisfying their<br/>wants. They maintain that the world is getting more and more<br/>united, more and more bound together in brotherly community, as it<br/>overcomes distance and sets thoughts flying through the air.<br/><br/>Alas, put no faith in such a bond of union. Interpreting freedom<br/>as the multiplication and rapid satisfaction of desires, men<br/>distort their own nature, for many senseless and foolish desires<br/>and habits and ridiculous fancies are fostered in them. They live<br/>only for mutual envy, for luxury and ostentation. To have dinners<br/>visits, carriages, rank, and slaves to wait on one is looked upon<br/>as a necessity, for which life, honour and human feeling are<br/>sacrificed, and men even commit suicide if they are unable to<br/>satisfy it. We see the same thing among those who are not rich,<br/>while the poor drown their unsatisfied need and their envy in<br/>drunkenness. But soon they will drink blood instead of wine, they<br/>are being led on to it. I ask you is such a man free? I knew one<br/>"champion of freedom" who told me himself that, when he was<br/>deprived of tobacco in prison, he was so wretched at the privation<br/>that he almost went and betrayed his cause for the sake of getting<br/>tobacco again! And such a man says, "I am fighting for the cause of<br/>humanity."<br/><br/>How can such a one fight? What is he fit for? He is capable<br/>perhaps of some action quickly over, but he cannot hold out long.<br/>And it's no wonder that instead of gaining freedom they have sunk<br/>into slavery, and instead of serving, the cause of brotherly love<br/>and the union of humanity have fallen, on the contrary, into<br/>dissension and isolation, as my mysterious visitor and teacher said<br/>to me in my youth. And therefore the idea of the service of<br/>humanity, of brotherly love and the solidarity of mankind, is more<br/>and more dying out in the world, and indeed this idea is sometimes<br/>treated with derision. For how can a man shake off his habits? What<br/>can become of him if he is in such bondage to the habit of<br/>satisfying the innumerable desires he has created for himself? He<br/>is isolated, and what concern has he with the rest of humanity?<br/>They have succeeded in accumulating a greater mass of objects, but<br/>the joy in the world has grown less.<br/><br/>The monastic way is very different. Obedience, fasting, and<br/>prayer are laughed at, yet only through them lies the way to real,<br/>true freedom. I cut off my superfluous and unnecessary desires, I<br/>subdue my proud and wanton will and chastise it with obedience, and<br/>with God's help I attain freedom of spirit and with it spiritual<br/>joy. Which is most capable of conceiving a great idea and serving<br/>it- the rich in his isolation or the man who has freed himself from<br/>the tyranny of material things and habits? The monk is reproached<br/>for his solitude, "You have secluded yourself within the walls of<br/>the monastery for your own salvation, and have forgotten the<br/>brotherly service of humanity!" But we shall see which will be most<br/>zealous in the cause of brotherly love. For it is not we, but they,<br/>who are in isolation, though they don't see that. Of old, leaders<br/>of the people came from among us, and why should they not again?<br/>The same meek and humble ascetics will rise up and go out to work<br/>for the great cause. The salvation of Russia comes from the people.<br/>And the Russian monk has always been on the side of the people. We<br/>are isolated only if the people are isolated. The people believe as<br/>we do, and an unbelieving reformer will never do anything in<br/>Russia, even if he is sincere in heart and a genius. Remember that!<br/>The people will meet the atheist and overcome him, and Russia will<br/>be one and orthodox. Take care of the peasant and guard his heart.<br/>Go on educating him quietly. That's your duty as monks, for the<br/>peasant has God in his heart.<br/>
