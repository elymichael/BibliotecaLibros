<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>7<br/>And in the Open Air<br/><br/><br/>"THE air is fresh, but in my apartment it is not so in any sense<br/>of the word. Let us walk slowly, sir. I should be glad of your kind<br/>interest."<br/><br/>"I too have something important to say to you," observed<br/>Alyosha, "only I don't know how to begin."<br/><br/>"To be sure you must have business with me. You would never have<br/>looked in upon me without some object. Unless you come simply to<br/>complain of the boy, and that's hardly likely. And, by the way,<br/>about the boy: I could not explain to you in there, but here I will<br/>describe that scene to you. My tow was thicker a week ago- I mean<br/>my beard. That's the nickname they give to my beard, the schoolboys<br/>most of all. Well, your brother Dmitri Fyodorovitch was pulling me<br/>by my beard, I'd done nothing, he was in a towering rage and<br/>happened to come upon me. He dragged me out of the tavern into the<br/>market place; at that moment the boys were coming out of school,<br/>and with them Ilusha. As soon as he saw me in such a state he<br/>rushed up to me. 'Father,' he cried, 'father!' He caught hold of<br/>me, hugged me, tried to pull me away, crying to my assailant, 'Let<br/>go, let go, it's my father, forgive him!'- yes, he actually cried<br/>'forgive him.' He clutched at that hand, that very hand, in his<br/>little hands and kissed it… . I remember his little face at that<br/>moment, I haven't forgotten it and I never shall!"<br/><br/>"I swear," cried Alyosha, "that my brother will express his most<br/>deep and sincere regret, even if he has to go down on his knees in<br/>that same market-place… . I'll make him or he is no brother of<br/>mine!<br/><br/>"Aha, then it's only a suggestion! And it does not come from him<br/>but simply from the generosity of your own warm heart. You should<br/>have said so. No, in that case allow me to tell you of your<br/>brother's highly chivalrous soldierly generosity, for he did give<br/>expression to it at the time. He left off dragging me by my beard<br/>and released me: 'You are an officer,' he said, 'and I am an<br/>officer, if you can find a decent man to be your second send me<br/>your challenge. I will give satisfaction, though you are a<br/>scoundrel.' That's what he said. A chivalrous spirit indeed! I<br/>retired with Ilusha, and that scene is a family record imprinted<br/>forever on Ilusha's soul. No, it's not for us to claim the<br/>privileges of noblemen. Judge for yourself. You've just been in our<br/>mansion, what did you see there? Three ladies, one a cripple and<br/>weak-minded, another a cripple and hunchback and the third not<br/>crippled but far too clever. She is a student, dying to get back to<br/>Petersburg, to work for the emancipation of the Russian woman on<br/>the banks of the Neva. I won't speak of Ilusha, he is only nine. I<br/>am alone in the world, and if I die, what will become of all of<br/>them? I simply ask you that. And if I challenge him and he kills me<br/>on the spot, what then? What will become of them? And worse still,<br/>if he doesn't kill me but only cripples me: I couldn't work, but I<br/>should still be a mouth to feed. Who would feed it and who would<br/>feed them all? Must I take Ilusha from school and send him to beg<br/>in the streets? That's what it means for me to challenge him to a<br/>duel. It's silly talk and nothing else."<br/><br/>"He will beg your forgiveness, he will bow down at your feet in<br/>the middle of the marketplace," cried Alyosha again, with glowing<br/>eyes.<br/><br/>"I did think of prosecuting him," the captain went on, "but look<br/>in our code, could I get much compensation for a personal injury?<br/>And then Agrafena Alexandrovna<br/>
