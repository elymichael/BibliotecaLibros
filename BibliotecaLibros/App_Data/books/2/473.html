<br/>"You are awfully cross, because I don't talk about holy things.<br/>I don't want to be holy. What will they do to one in the next world<br/>for the greatest sin? You must know all about that."<br/><br/>"God will censure you." Alyosha was watching her steadily.<br/><br/>"That's just what I should like. I would go up and they would<br/>censure me, and I would burst out laughing in their faces. I should<br/>dreadfully like to set fire to the house, Alyosha, to our house;<br/>you still don't believe me?"<br/><br/>"Why? There are children of twelve years old, who have a longing<br/>to set fire to something and they do set things on fire, too. It's<br/>a sort of disease."<br/><br/>"That's not true, that's not true; there may be children, but<br/>that's not what I mean."<br/><br/>"You take evil for good; it's a passing crisis; it's the result<br/>of your illness, perhaps."<br/><br/>"You do despise me, though! It's simply that I don't want to do<br/>good, I want to do evil, and it has nothing to do with<br/>illness."<br/><br/>"Why do evil?"<br/><br/>"So that everything might be destroyed. Ah, how nice it would be<br/>if everything were destroyed! You know, Alyosha, I sometimes think<br/>of doing a fearful lot of harm and everything bad, and I should do<br/>it for a long while on the sly and suddenly everyone would find it<br/>out. Everyone will stand round and point their fingers at me and I<br/>would look at them all. That would be awfully nice. Why would it be<br/>so nice, Alyosha?"<br/><br/>"I don't know. It's a craving to destroy something good or, as<br/>you say, to set fire to something. It happens sometimes."<br/><br/>
