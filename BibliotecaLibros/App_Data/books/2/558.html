<br/>"I cannot positively assert," the prosecutor continued, "that<br/>the prisoner fully intended to murder his father before that<br/>incident. Yet the idea had several times presented itself to him,<br/>and he had deliberated on it- for that we have facts, witnesses,<br/>and his own words. I confess, gentlemen of the jury," he added,<br/>"that till to-day I have been uncertain whether to attribute to the<br/>prisoner conscious premeditation. I was firmly convinced that he<br/>had pictured the fatal moment beforehand, but had only pictured it,<br/>contemplating it as a possibility. He had not definitely considered<br/>when and how he might commit the crime.<br/><br/>"But I was only uncertain till to-day, till that fatal document<br/>was presented to the court just now. You yourselves heard that<br/>young lady's exclamation, 'It is the plan, the programme of the<br/>murder!' That is how she defined that miserable, drunken letter of<br/>the unhappy prisoner. And, in fact, from that letter we see that<br/>the whole fact of the murder was premeditated. It was written two<br/>days before, and so we know now for a fact that, forty-eight hours<br/>before the perpetration of his terrible design, the prisoner swore<br/>that, if he could not get money next day, he would murder his<br/>father in order to take the envelope with the notes from under his<br/>pillow, as soon as Ivan had left. 'As soon as Ivan had gone away'-<br/>you hear that; so he had thought everything out, weighing every<br/>circumstance, and he carried it all out just as he had written it.<br/>The proof of premeditation is conclusive; the crime must have been<br/>committed for the sake of the money, that is stated clearly, that<br/>is written and signed. The prisoner does not deny his<br/>signature.<br/><br/>"I shall be told he was drunk when he wrote it. But that does<br/>not diminish the value of the letter, quite the contrary; he wrote<br/>when drunk what he had planned when sober. Had he not planned it<br/>when sober, he would not have written it when drunk. I shall be<br/>asked: Then why did he talk about it in taverns? A man who<br/>premeditates such a crime is silent and keeps it to himself. Yes,<br/>but he talked about it before he had formed a plan, when he had<br/>only the desire, only the impulse to it. Afterwards he talked less<br/>about it. On the evening he wrote that letter at the Metropolis<br/>tavern, contrary to his custom he was silent, though he had been<br/>drinking. He did not play billiards, he sat in a corner, talked to<br/>no one. He did indeed turn a shopman out of his seat, but that was<br/>done almost unconsciously, because he could never enter a tavern<br/>without making a disturbance. It is true that after he had taken<br/>the final decision, he must have felt apprehensive that he had<br/>talked too much about his design beforehand, and that this might<br/>lead to his arrest and prosecution afterwards. But there was<br/>nothing for it; he could not take his words back, but his luck had<br/>served him before, it would serve him again. He believed in his<br/>star, you know! I must confess, too, that he did a great deal to<br/>avoid the fatal catastrophe. 'To-morrow I shall try and borrow the<br/>money from everyone,' as he writes in his peculiar language,' and<br/>if they won't give it to me, there will be bloodshed.'"<br/><br/>Here Ippolit Kirillovitch passed to a detailed description of<br/>all Mitya's efforts to borrow the money. He described his visit to<br/>Samsonov, his journey to Lyagavy. "Harassed, jeered at, hungry,<br/>after selling his watch to pay for the journey (though he tells us<br/>he had fifteen hundred roubles on him- a likely story), tortured by<br/>jealousy at having left the object of his affections in the town,<br/>suspecting that she would go to Fyodor Pavlovitch in his absense,<br/>he returned at last to the town, to find, to his joy, that she had<br/>not been near his father. He accompanied her himself to her<br/>protector. (Strange to say, he doesn't seem to have been jealous of<br/>Samsonov, which is psychologically interesting.) Then he hastens<br/>back to his ambush in the back gardens, and then learns that<br/>Smerdyakov is in a fit, that the other servant is ill- the coast is<br/>clear and he knows the 'signals'- what a temptation! Still he<br/>resists it; he goes off to a lady who has for some time been<br/>residing in the town, and who is highly esteemed among us, Madame<br/>Hohlakov. That lady, who had long watched his career with<br/>compassion, gave him the most judicious advice, to give up his<br/>dissipated life, his unseemly love-affair, the waste of his youth<br/>and vigour in pot-house debauchery, and to set off to Siberia to<br/>the gold mines: 'that would be an outlet for your turbulent<br/>energies, your romantic character, your thirst for adventure.'"<br/><br/>After describing the result of this conversation and the moment<br/>when the prisoner learnt that Grushenka had not remained at<br/>Samsonov's, the sudden frenzy of the luckless man worn out with<br/>jealousy and nervous exhaustion, at the thought that she had<br/>deceived him and was now with his father, Ippolit Kirillovitch<br/>concluded by dwelling upon the fatal influence of chance. "Had the<br/>maid told him that her mistress was at Mokroe with her former<br/>lover, nothing would have happened. But she lost her head, she<br/>could only swear and protest her ignorance, and if the prisoner did<br/>not kill her on the spot, it was only because he flew in pursuit of<br/>his false mistress.<br/><br/>"But note, frantic as he was, he took with him a brass pestle.<br/>Why that? Why not some other weapon? But since he had been<br/>contemplating his plan and preparing himself for it for a whole<br/>month, he would snatch up anything like a weapon that caught his<br/>eye. He had realised for a month past that any object of the kind<br/>would serve as a weapon, so he instantly, without hesitation,<br/>recognised that it would serve his purpose. So it was by no means<br/>unconsciously, by no means involuntarily, that he snatched up that<br/>fatal pestle. And then we find him in his father's garden- the<br/>coast is clear, there are no witnesses, darkness and jealousy. The<br/>suspicion that she was there, with him, with his rival, in his<br/>arms, and perhaps laughing at him at that moment- took his breath<br/>away. And it was not mere suspicion, the deception was open,<br/>obvious. She must be there, in that lighted room, she must be<br/>behind the screen; and the unhappy man would have us believe that<br/>he stole up to the window, peeped respectfully in, and discreetly<br/>withdrew, for fear something terrible and immoral should happen.<br/>And he tries to persuade us of that, us, who understand his<br/>character, who know his state of mind at the moment, and that he<br/>knew the signals by which he could at once enter the house." At<br/>this point Ippolit Kirillovitch broke off to discuss exhaustively<br/>the suspected connection of Smerdyakov with the murder. He did this<br/>very circumstantially, and everyone realised that, although he<br/>professed to despise that suspicion, he thought the subject of<br/>great importance.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
