<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>2<br/>The Old Buffoon<br/><br/><br/>THEY entered the room almost at the same moment that the elder<br/>came in from his bedroom. There were already in the cell, awaiting<br/>the elder, two monks of the hermitage, one the Father Librarian,<br/>and the other Father Paissy, a very learned man, so they said, in<br/>delicate health, though not old. There was also a tall young man,<br/>who looked about two and twenty, standing in the corner throughout<br/>the interview. He had a broad, fresh face, and clever, observant,<br/>narrow brown eyes, and was wearing ordinary dress. He was a<br/>divinity student, living under the protection of the monastery. His<br/>expression was one of unquestioning, but self-respecting,<br/>reverence. Being in a subordinate and dependent position, and so<br/>not on an equality with the guests, he did not greet them with a<br/>bow.<br/><br/>Father Zossima was accompanied by a novice, and by Alyosha. The<br/>two monks rose and greeted him with a very deep bow, touching the<br/>ground with their fingers; then kissed his hand. Blessing them, the<br/>elder replied with as deep a reverence to them, and asked their<br/>blessing. The whole ceremony was performed very seriously and with<br/>an appearance of feeling, not like an everyday rite. But Miusov<br/>fancied that it was all done with intentional impressiveness. He<br/>stood in front of the other visitors. He ought- he had reflected<br/>upon it the evening before- from simple politeness, since it was<br/>the custom here, to have gone up to receive the elder's blessing,<br/>even if he did not kiss his hand. But when he saw all this bowing<br/>and kissing on the part of the monks he instantly changed his mind.<br/>With dignified gravity he made a rather deep, conventional bow, and<br/>moved away to a chair. Fyodor Pavlovitch did the same, mimicking<br/>Miusov like an ape. Ivan bowed with great dignity and courtesy, but<br/>he too kept his hands at his sides, while Kalganov was so confused<br/>that he did not bow at all. The elder let fall the hand raised to<br/>bless them, and bowing to them again, asked them all to sit down.<br/>The blood rushed to Alyosha's cheeks. He was ashamed. His<br/>forebodings were coming true.<br/><br/>Father Zossima sat down on a very old-fashioned mahogany sofa,<br/>covered with leather, and made his visitors sit down in a row along<br/>the opposite wall on four mahogany chairs, covered with shabby<br/>black leather. The monks sat, one at the door and the other at the<br/>window. The divinity student, the novice, and Alyosha remained<br/>standing. The cell was not very large and had a faded look. It<br/>contained nothing but the most necessary furniture, of coarse and<br/>poor quality. There were two pots of flowers in the window, and a<br/>number of holy pictures in the corner. Before one huge ancient ikon<br/>of the virgin a lamp was burning. Near it were two other holy<br/>pictures in shining settings, and, next them, carved cherubim,<br/>china eggs, a Catholic cross of ivory, with a Mater Dolorosa<br/>embracing it, and several foreign engravings from the great Italian<br/>artists of past centuries. Next to these costly and artistic<br/>engravings were several of the roughest Russian prints of saints<br/>and martyrs, such as are sold for a few farthings at all the fairs.<br/>On the other walls were portraits of Russian bishops, past and<br/>present.<br/><br/>Miusov took a cursory glance at all these "conventional"<br/>surroundings and bent an intent look upon the elder. He had a high<br/>opinion of his own insight a weakness excusable in him as he was<br/>fifty, an age at which a clever man of the world of established<br/>position can hardly help taking himself rather seriously. At the<br/>first moment he did not like Zossima. There was, indeed, something<br/>in the elder's face which many people besides Miusov might not have<br/>liked. He was a short, bent, little man, with very weak legs, and<br/>though he was only sixty-five, he looked at least ten years older.<br/>His face was very thin and covered with a network of fine wrinkles,<br/>particularly numerous about his eyes, which were small,<br/>light-coloured, quick, and shining like two bright points. He had a<br/>sprinkling of grey hair about his temples. His pointed beard was<br/>small and scanty, and his lips, which smiled frequently, were as<br/>thin as two threads. His nose was not long, but sharp, like a<br/>bird's beak.<br/><br/>"To all appearances a malicious soul, full of petty pride,"<br/>thought Miusov. He felt altogether dissatisfied with his<br/>position.<br/><br/>A cheap little clock on the wall struck twelve hurriedly, and<br/>served to begin the conversation.<br/><br/>"Precisely to our time," cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, "but no sign<br/>of my son, Dmitri. I apologise for him, sacred elder!" (Alyosha<br/>shuddered all over at "sacred elder".) "I am always punctual<br/>myself, minute for minute, remembering that punctuality is the<br/>courtesy of kingsâ€¦ .<br/>
