<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>1<br/>They Arrive at the Monastery<br/><br/><br/>IT was a warm, bright day the end of August. The interview with<br/>the elder had been fixed for half-past eleven, immediately after<br/>late mass. Our visitors did not take part in the service, but<br/>arrived just as it was over. First an elegant open carriage, drawn<br/>by two valuable horses, drove up with Miusov and a distant relative<br/>of his, a young man of twenty, called Pyotr Fomitch Kalganov. This<br/>young man was preparing to enter the university. Miusov with whom<br/>he was staying for the time, was trying to persuade him to go<br/>abroad to the university of Zurich or Jena. The young man was still<br/>undecided. He was thoughtful and absent-minded. He was<br/>nice-looking, strongly built, and rather tall. There was a strange<br/>fixity in his gaze at times. Like all very absent-minded people he<br/>would sometimes stare at a person without seeing him. He was silent<br/>and rather awkward, but sometimes, when he was alone with anyone,<br/>he became talkative and effusive, and would laugh at anything or<br/>nothing. But his animation vanished as quickly as it appeared. He<br/>was always well and even elaborately dressed; he had already some<br/>independent fortune and expectations of much more. He was a friend<br/>of Alyosha's.<br/><br/>In an ancient, jolting, but roomy, hired carriage, with a pair<br/>of old pinkish-grey horses, a long way behind Miusov's carriage,<br/>came Fyodor Pavlovitch, with his son Ivan. Dmitri was late, though<br/>he had been informed of the time the evening before. The visitors<br/>left their carriage at the hotel, outside the precincts, and went<br/>to the gates of the monastery on foot. Except Fyodor Pavlovitch,<br/>more of the party had ever seen the monastery, and Miusov had<br/>probably not even been to church for thirty years. He looked about<br/>him with curiosity, together with assumed ease. But, except the<br/>church and the domestic buildings, though these too were ordinary<br/>enough, he found nothing of interest in the interior of the<br/>monastery. The last of the worshippers were coming out of the<br/>church bareheaded and crossing themselves. Among the humbler people<br/>were a few of higher rank- two or three ladies and a very old<br/>general. They were all staying at the hotel. Our visitors were at<br/>once surrounded by beggars, but none of them gave them anything,<br/>except young Kalganov, who took a ten-copeck piece out of his<br/>purse, and, nervous and embarrassed- God knows why!- hurriedly gave<br/>it to an old woman, saying: "Divide it equally." None of his<br/>companions made any remark upon it, so that he had no reason to be<br/>embarrassed; but, perceiving this, he was even more overcome.<br/><br/>It was strange that their arrival did not seem expected, and<br/>that they were not received with special honour, though one of them<br/>had recently made a donation of a thousand roubles, while another<br/>was a very wealthy and highly cultured landowner, upon whom all in<br/>the monastery were in a sense dependent, as a decision of the<br/>lawsuit might at any moment put their fishing rights in his hands.<br/>Yet no official personage met them.<br/><br/>Miusov looked absent-mindedly at the tombstones round the<br/>church, and was on the point of saying that the dead buried here<br/>must have paid a pretty penny for the right of lying in this "holy<br/>place," but refrained. His liberal irony was rapidly changing<br/>almost into anger.<br/><br/>"Who the devil is there to ask in this imbecile place? We must<br/>find out, for time is passing," he observed suddenly, as though<br/>speaking to himself.<br/><br/>All at once there came up a bald-headed, elderly man with<br/>ingratiating little eyes, wearing a full, summer overcoat. Lifting<br/>his hat, he introduced himself with a honeyed lisp as Maximov, a<br/>landowner of Tula. He at once entered into our visitors'<br/>difficulty.<br/><br/>"Father Zossima lives in the hermitage, apart, four hundred<br/>paces from the monastery, the other side of the copse."<br/>
