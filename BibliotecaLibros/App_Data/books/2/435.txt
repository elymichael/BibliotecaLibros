"Oh no; there are people of deep feeling who have been somehow
crushed. Buffoonery in them is a form of resentful irony against
those to whom they daren't speak the truth, from having been for
years humiliated and intimidated by them. Believe me, Krassotkin,
that sort of buffoonery is sometimes tragic in the extreme. His
whole life now is centred in Ilusha, and if Ilusha dies, he will
either go mad with grief or kill himself. I feel almost certain of
that when I look at him now."

"I understand you, Karamazov. I see you understand human
nature," Kolya added, with feeling.

"And as soon as I saw you with a dog, I thought it was Zhutchka
you were bringing."

"Wait a bit, Karamazov, perhaps we shall find it yet; but this
is Perezvon. I'll let him go in now and perhaps it will amuse
Ilusha more than the mastiff pup. Wait a bit, Karamazov, you will
know something in a minute. But, I say, I am keeping you here!"
Kolya cried suddenly. "You've no overcoat on in this bitter cold.
You see what an egoist I am. Oh, we are all egoists,
Karamazov!"

"Don't trouble; it is cold, but I don't often catch cold. Let us
go in, though, and, by the way, what is your name? I know you are
called Kolya, but what else?"

"Nikolay- Nikolay Ivanovitch Krassotkin, or, as they say in
official documents, 'Krassotkin son.'" Kolya laughed for some
reason, but added suddenly, "Of course I hate my name Nikolay."

"Why so?"

"It's so trivial, so ordinary."

"You are thirteen?" asked Alyosha.

"No, fourteen- that is, I shall be fourteen very soon, in a
fortnight. I'll confess one weakness of mine, Karamazov, just to
you, since it's our first meeting, so that you may understand my
character at once. I hate being asked my age, more than that… and
in fact… there's a libellous story going about me, that last week I
played robbers with the preparatory boys. It's a fact that I did
play with them, but it's a perfect libel to say I did it for my own
amusement. I have reasons for believing that you've heard the
story; but I wasn't playing for my own amusement, it was for the
sake of the children, because they couldn't think of anything to do
by themselves. But they've always got some silly tale. This is an
awful town for gossip, I can tell you."

"But what if you had been playing for your own amusement, what's
the harm?"
