<br/>He was saved by meeting an old merchant who was being driven<br/>across country in a hired trap. When he overtook him, Mitya asked<br/>the way and it turned out that the old merchant, too, was going to<br/>Volovya. After some discussion Mitya got into the trap. Three hours<br/>later they arrived. At Volovya, Mitya at once ordered<br/>posting-horses to drive to the town, and suddenly realised that he<br/>was appallingly hungry. While the horses were being harnessed, an<br/>omelette was prepared for him. He ate it all in an instant, ate a<br/>huge hunk of bread, ate a sausage, and swallowed three glasses of<br/>vodka. After eating, his spirits and his heart grew lighter. He<br/>flew towards the town, urged on the driver, and suddenly made a new<br/>and "unalterable" plan to procure that "accursed money" before<br/>evening. "And to think, only to think that a man's life should be<br/>ruined for the sake of that paltry three thousand!" he cried,<br/>contemptuously. "I'll settle it to-day." And if it had not been for<br/>the thought of Grushenka and of what might have happened to her,<br/>which never left him, he would perhaps have become quite cheerful<br/>againâ€¦ . But the thought of her was stabbing him to the heart every<br/>moment, like a sharp knife.<br/><br/>At last they arrived, and Mitya at once ran to Grushenka.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
