<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>3<br/>The Second Marriage and the Second Family<br/><br/><br/>VERY shortly after getting his four-year-old Mitya off his hands<br/>Fyodor Pavlovitch married a second time. His second marriage lasted<br/>eight years. He took this second wife, Sofya Ivanovna, also a very<br/>young girl, from another province, where he had gone upon some<br/>small piece of business in company with a Jew. Though Fyodor<br/>Pavlovitch was a drunkard and a vicious debauchee he never<br/>neglected investing his capital, and managed his business affairs<br/>very successfully, though, no doubt, not over-scrupulously. Sofya<br/>Ivanovna was the daughter of an obscure deacon, and was left from<br/>childhood an orphan without relations. She grew up in the house of<br/>a general's widow, a wealthy old lady of good position, who was at<br/>once her benefactress and tormentor. I do not know the details, but<br/>I have only heard that the orphan girl, a meek and gentle creature,<br/>was once cut down from a halter in which she was hanging from a<br/>nail in the loft, so terrible were her sufferings from the caprice<br/>and everlasting nagging of this old woman, who was apparently not<br/>bad-hearted but had become an insufferable tyrant through<br/>idleness.<br/><br/>Fyodor Pavlovitch made her an offer; inquiries were made about<br/>him and he was refused. But again, as in his first marriage, he<br/>proposed an elopement to the orphan girl. There is very little<br/>doubt that she would not on any account have married him if she had<br/>known a little more about him in time. But she lived in another<br/>province; besides, what could a little girl of sixteen know about<br/>it, except that she would be better at the bottom of the river than<br/>remaining with her benefactress. So the poor child exchanged a<br/>benefactress for a benefactor. Fyodor Pavlovitch did not get a<br/>penny this time, for the general's widow was furious. She gave them<br/>nothing and cursed them both. But he had not reckoned on a dowry;<br/>what allured him was the remarkable beauty of the innocent girl,<br/>above all her innocent appearance, which had a peculiar attraction<br/>for a vicious profligate, who had hitherto admired only the coarser<br/>types of feminine beauty.<br/><br/>"Those innocent eyes slit my soul up like a razor," he used to<br/>say afterwards, with his loathsome snigger. In a man so depraved<br/>this might, of course, mean no more than sensual attraction. As he<br/>had received no dowry with his wife, and had, so to speak, taken<br/>her "from the halter," he did not stand on ceremony with her.<br/>Making her feel that she had "wronged" him, he took advantage of<br/>her phenomenal meekness and submissiveness to trample on the<br/>elementary decencies of marriage. He gathered loose women into his<br/>house, and carried on orgies of debauchery in his wife's presence.<br/>To show what a pass things had come to, I may mention that Grigory,<br/>the gloomy, stupid, obstinate, argumentative servant, who had<br/>always hated his first mistress, Adelaida Ivanovna, took the side<br/>of his new mistress. He championed her cause, abusing Fyodor<br/>Pavlovitch in a manner little befitting a servant, and on one<br/>occasion broke up the revels and drove all the disorderly women out<br/>of the house. In the end this unhappy young woman, kept in terror<br/>from her childhood, fell into that kind of nervous disease which is<br/>most frequently found in peasant women who are said to be<br/>"possessed by devils." At times after terrible fits of hysterics<br/>she even lost her reason. Yet she bore Fyodor Pavlovitch two sons,<br/>Ivan and Alexey, the eldest in the first year of marriage and the<br/>second three years later. When she died, little Alexey was in his<br/>fourth year, and, strange as it seems, I know that he remembered<br/>his mother all his life, like a dream, of course. At her death<br/>almost exactly the same thing happened to the two little boys as to<br/>their elder brother, Mitya. They were completely forgotten and<br/>abandoned by their father. They were looked after by the same<br/>Grigory and lived in his cottage, where they were found by the<br/>tyrannical old lady who had brought up their mother. She was still<br/>alive, and had not, all those eight years, forgotten the insult<br/>done her. All that time she was obtaining exact information as to<br/>her Sofya's manner of life, and hearing of her illness and hideous<br/>surroundings she declared aloud two or three times to her<br/>retainers:<br/><br/>"It serves her right. God has punished her for her<br/>ingratitude."<br/><br/>Exactly three months after Sofya Ivanovna's death the general's<br/>widow suddenly appeared in our town, and went straight to Fyodor<br/>Pavlovitch's house. She spent only half an hour in the town but she<br/>did a great deal. It was evening. Fyodor Pavlovitch, whom she had<br/>not seen for those eight years, came in to her drunk. The story is<br/>that instantly upon seeing him, without any sort of explanation,<br/>she gave him two good, resounding slaps on the face, seized him by<br/>a tuft of hair, and shook him three times up and down. Then,<br/>without a word, she went straight to the cottage to the two boys.<br/>Seeing, at the first glance, that they were unwashed and in dirty<br/>linen, she promptly gave Grigory, too, a box on the ear, and<br/>announcing that she would carry off both the children she wrapped<br/>them just as they were in a rug, put them in the carriage, and<br/>drove off to her own town. Grigory accepted the blow like a devoted<br/>slave, without a word, and when he escorted the old lady to her<br/>carriage he made her a low bow and pronounced impressively that,<br/>"God would repay her for orphans." "You are a blockhead all the<br/>same," the old lady shouted to him as she drove away.<br/><br/>Fyodor Pavlovitch, thinking it over, decided that it was a good<br/>thing, and did not refuse the general's widow his formal consent to<br/>any proposition in regard to his children's education. As for the<br/>slaps she had given him, he drove all over the town telling the<br/>story.<br/><br/>It happened that the old lady died soon after this, but she left<br/>the boys in her will a thousand roubles each "for their<br/>instruction, and so that all be spent on them exclusively, with the<br/>condition that it be so portioned out as to last till they are<br/>twenty-one, for it is more than adequate provision for such<br/>children. If other people think fit to throw away their money, let<br/>them." I have not read the will myself, but I heard there was<br/>something queer of the sort, very whimsically expressed. The<br/>principal heir, Yefim Petrovitch Polenov, the Marshal of Nobility<br/>of the province, turned out, however, to be an honest man. Writing<br/>to Fyodor Pavlovitch, and discerning at once that he could extract<br/>nothing from him for his children's education (though the latter<br/>never directly refused but only procrastinated as he always did in<br/>such cases, and was, indeed, at times effusively sentimental),<br/>Yefim Petrovitch took a personal interest in the orphans. He became<br/>especially fond of the younger, Alexey, who lived for a long while<br/>as one of his family. I beg the reader to note this from the<br/>beginning. And to Yefim Petrovitch, a man of a generosity and<br/>humanity rarely to be met with, the young people were more indebted<br/>for their education and bringing up than to anyone. He kept the two<br/>thousand roubles left to them by the general's widow intact, so<br/>that by the time they came of age their portions had been doubled<br/>by the accumulation of interest. He educated them both at his own<br/>expense, and certainly spent far more than a thousand roubles upon<br/>each of them. I won't enter into a detailed account of their<br/>boyhood and youth, but will only mention a few of the most<br/>important events. Of the elder, Ivan, I will only say that he grew<br/>into a somewhat morose and reserved, though far from timid boy. At<br/>ten years old he had realised that they were living not in their<br/>own home but on other people's charity, and that their father was a<br/>man of whom it was disgraceful to speak. This boy began very early,<br/>almost in his infancy (so they say at least), to show a brilliant<br/>and unusual aptitude for learning. I don't know precisely why, but<br/>he left the family of Yefim Petrovitch when he was hardly thirteen,<br/>entering a Moscow gymnasium and boarding with an experienced and<br/>celebrated teacher, an old friend of Yefim Petrovitch. Ivan used to<br/>declare afterwards that this was all due to the "ardour for good<br/>works" of Yefim Petrovitch, who was captivated by the idea that the<br/>boy's genius should be trained by a teacher of genius. But neither<br/>Yefim Petrovitch nor this teacher was living when the young man<br/>finished at the gymnasium and entered the university. As Yefim<br/>Petrovitch had made no provision for the payment of the tyrannical<br/>old lady's legacy, which had grown from one thousand to two, it was<br/>delayed, owing to formalities inevitable in Russia, and the young<br/>man was in great straits for the first two years at the university,<br/>as he was forced to keep himself all the time he was studying. It<br/>must be noted that he did not even attempt to communicate with his<br/>father, perhaps from pride, from contempt for him, or perhaps from<br/>his cool common sense, which told him that from such a father he<br/>would get no real assistance. However that may have been, the young<br/>man was by no means despondent and succeeded in getting work, at<br/>first giving sixpenny lessons and afterwards getting paragraphs on<br/>street incidents into the newspapers under the signature of<br/>"Eye-Witness." These paragraphs, it was said, were so interesting<br/>and piquant that they were soon taken. This alone showed the young<br/>man's practical and intellectual superiority over the masses of<br/>needy and unfortunate students of both sexes who hang about the<br/>offices of the newspapers and journals, unable to think of anything<br/>better than everlasting entreaties for copying and translations<br/>from the French. Having once got into touch with the editors Ivan<br/>Fyodorovitch always kept up his connection with them, and in his<br/>latter years at the university he published brilliant reviews of<br/>books upon various special subjects, so that he became well known<br/>in literary circles. But only in his last year he suddenly<br/>succeeded in attracting the attention of a far wider circle of<br/>readers, so that a great many people noticed and remembered him. It<br/>was rather a curious incident. When he had just left the university<br/>and was preparing to go abroad upon his two thousand roubles, Ivan<br/>Fyodorovitch published in one of the more important journals a<br/>strange article, which attracted general notice, on a subject of<br/>which he might have been supposed to know nothing, as he was a<br/>student of natural science. The article dealt with a subject which<br/>was being debated everywhere at the time- the position of the<br/>ecclesiastical courts. After discussing several opinions on the<br/>subject he went on to explain his own view. What was most striking<br/>about the article was its tone, and its unexpected conclusion. Many<br/>of the Church party regarded him unquestioningly as on their side.<br/>And yet not only the secularists but even atheists joined them in<br/>their applause. Finally some sagacious persons opined that the<br/>article was nothing but an impudent satirical burlesque. I mention<br/>this incident particularly because this article penetrated into the<br/>famous monastery in our neighbourhood, where the inmates, being<br/>particularly interested in question of the ecclesiastical courts,<br/>were completely bewildered by it. Learning the author's name, they<br/>were interested in his being a native of the town and the son of<br/>"that Fyodor Pavlovitch." And just then it was that the author<br/>himself made his appearance among us.<br/>
