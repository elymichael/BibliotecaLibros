<br/>"'Receiving bread from us, they will see clearly that we take<br/>the bread made by their hands from them, to give it to them,<br/>without any miracle. They will see that we do not change the stones<br/>to bread, but in truth they will be more thankful for taking it<br/>from our hands than for the bread itself! For they will remember<br/>only too well that in old days, without our help, even the bread<br/>they made turned to stones in their hands, while since they have<br/>come back to us, the very stones have turned to bread in their<br/>hands. Too, too well will they know the value of complete<br/>submission! And until men know that, they will be unhappy. Who is<br/>most to blame for their not knowing it?-speak! Who scattered the<br/>flock and sent it astray on unknown paths? But the flock will come<br/>together again and will submit once more, and then it will be once<br/>for all. Then we shall give them the quiet humble happiness of weak<br/>creatures such as they are by nature. Oh, we shall persuade them at<br/>last not to be proud, for Thou didst lift them up and thereby<br/>taught them to be proud. We shall show them that they are weak,<br/>that they are only pitiful children, but that childlike happiness<br/>is the sweetest of all. They will become timid and will look to us<br/>and huddle close to us in fear, as chicks to the hen. They will<br/>marvel at us and will be awe-stricken before us, and will be proud<br/>at our being so powerful and clever that we have been able to<br/>subdue such a turbulent flock of thousands of millions. They will<br/>tremble impotently before our wrath, their minds will grow fearful,<br/>they will be quick to shed tears like women and children, but they<br/>will be just as ready at a sign from us to pass to laughter and<br/>rejoicing, to happy mirth and childish song. Yes, we shall set them<br/>to work, but in their leisure hours we shall make their life like a<br/>child's game, with children's songs and innocent dance. Oh, we<br/>shall allow them even sin, they are weak and helpless, and they<br/>will love us like children because we allow them to sin. We shall<br/>tell them that every sin will be expiated, if it is done with our<br/>permission, that we allow them to sin because we love them, and the<br/>punishment for these sins we take upon ourselves. And we shall take<br/>it upon ourselves, and they will adore us as their saviours who<br/>have taken on themselves their sins before God. And they will have<br/>no secrets from us. We shall allow or forbid them to live with<br/>their wives and mistresses, to have or not to have children<br/>according to whether they have been obedient or disobedient- and<br/>they will submit to us gladly and cheerfully. The most painful<br/>secrets of their conscience, all, all they will bring to us, and we<br/>shall have an answer for all. And they will be glad to believe our<br/>answer, for it will save them from the great anxiety and terrible<br/>agony they endure at present in making a free decision for<br/>themselves. And all will be happy, all the millions of creatures<br/>except the hundred thousand who rule over them. For only we, we who<br/>guard the mystery, shall be unhappy. There will be thousands of<br/>millions of happy babes, and a hundred thousand sufferers who have<br/>taken upon themselves the curse of the knowledge of good and evil.<br/>Peacefully they will die, peacefully they will expire in Thy name,<br/>and beyond the grave they will find nothing but death. But we shall<br/>keep the secret, and for their happiness we shall allure them with<br/>the reward of heaven and eternity. Though if there were anything in<br/>the other world, it certainly would not be for such as they. It is<br/>prophesied that Thou wilt come again in victory, Thou wilt come<br/>with Thy chosen, the proud and strong, but we will say that they<br/>have only saved themselves, but we have saved all. We are told that<br/>the harlot who sits upon the beast, and holds in her hands the<br/>mystery, shall be put to shame, that the weak will rise up again,<br/>and will rend her royal purple and will strip naked her loathsome<br/>body. But then I will stand up and point out to Thee the thousand<br/>millions of happy children who have known no sin. And we who have<br/>taken their sins upon us for their happiness will stand up before<br/>Thee and say: "Judge us if Thou canst and darest." Know that I fear<br/>Thee not. Know that I too have been in the wilderness, I too have<br/>lived on roots and locusts, I too prized the freedom with which<br/>Thou hast blessed men, and I too was striving to stand among Thy<br/>elect, among the strong and powerful, thirsting "to make up the<br/>number." But I awakened and would not serve madness. I turned back<br/>and joined the ranks of those who have corrected Thy work. I left<br/>the proud and went back to the humble, for the happiness of the<br/>humble. What I say to Thee will come to pass, and our dominion will<br/>be built up. I repeat, to-morrow Thou shalt see that obedient flock<br/>who at a sign from me will hasten to heap up the hot cinders about<br/>the pile on which I shall burn Thee for coming to hinder us. For if<br/>anyone has ever deserved our fires, it is Thou. To-morrow I shall<br/>burn Thee. Dixi.'"<br/>[8]<br/>Ivan<br/>stopped. He was carried away as he talked, and spoke with<br/>excitement; when he had finished, he suddenly smiled. Alyosha had<br/>listened in silence; towards the end he was greatly moved and<br/>seemed several times on the point of interrupting, but restrained<br/>himself. Now his words came with a rush. "But… that's absurd!" he<br/>cried, flushing. "Your poem is in praise of Jesus, not in blame of<br/>Him- as you meant it to be. And who will believe you about freedom?<br/>Is that the way to understand it? That's not the idea of it in the<br/>Orthodox Church… . That's Rome, and not even the whole of Rome,<br/>it's false-those are the worst of the Catholics the Inquisitors,<br/>the Jesuits!… And there could not be such a fantastic creature as<br/>your Inquisitor. What are these sins of mankind they take on<br/>themselves? Who are these keepers of the mystery who have taken<br/>some curse upon themselves for the happiness of mankind? When have<br/>they been seen? We know the Jesuits, they are spoken ill of, but<br/>surely they are not what you describe? They are not that at all,<br/>not at all… . They are simply the Romish army for the earthly<br/>sovereignty of the world in the future, with the Pontiff of Rome<br/>for Emperor… that's their ideal, but there's no sort of mystery or<br/>lofty melancholy about it… . It's simple lust of power, of filthy<br/>earthly gain, of domination-something like a universal serfdom with<br/>them as masters-that's all they stand for. They don't even believe<br/>in God perhaps. Your suffering Inquisitor is a mere fantasy."<br/>"Stay, stay," laughed Ivan. "how hot you are! A fantasy you say,<br/>let it be so! Of course it's a fantasy. But allow me to say: do you<br/>really think that the Roman Catholic movement of the last centuries<br/>is actually nothing but the lust of power, of filthy earthly gain?<br/>Is that Father Paissy's teaching?" "No, no, on the contrary, Father<br/>Paissy did once say something rather the same as you… but of course<br/>it's not the same, not a bit the same," Alyosha hastily corrected<br/>himself. "A precious admission, in spite of your 'not a bit the<br/>same.' I ask you why your Jesuits and Inquisitors have united<br/>simply for vile material gain? Why can there not be among them one<br/>martyr oppressed by great sorrow and loving humanity? You see, only<br/>suppose that there was one such man among all those who desire<br/>nothing but filthy material gain-if there's only one like my old<br/>Inquisitor, who had himself eaten roots in the desert and made<br/>frenzied efforts to subdue his flesh to make himself free and<br/>perfect. But yet all his life he loved humanity, and suddenly his<br/>eyes were opened, and he saw that it is no great moral blessedness<br/>to attain perfection and freedom, if at the same time one gains the<br/>conviction that millions of God's creatures have been created as a<br/>mockery, that they will never be capable of using their freedom,<br/>that these poor rebels can never turn into giants to complete the<br/>tower, that it was not for such geese that the great idealist<br/>dreamt his dream of harmony. Seeing all that he turned back and<br/>joined- the clever people. Surely that could have happened?"<br/>"Joined whom, what clever people?" cried Alyosha, completely<br/>carried away. "They have no such great cleverness and no mysteries<br/>and secrets… . Perhaps nothing but Atheism, that's all their<br/>secret. Your Inquisitor does not believe in God, that's his<br/>secret!" "What if it is so! At last you have guessed it. It's<br/>perfectly true, it's true that that's the whole secret, but isn't<br/>that suffering, at least for a man like that, who has wasted his<br/>whole life in the desert and yet could not shake off his incurable<br/>love of humanity? In his old age he reached the clear conviction<br/>that nothing but the advice of the great dread spirit could build<br/>up any tolerable sort of life for the feeble, unruly, 'incomplete,<br/>empirical creatures created in jest.' And so, convinced of this, he<br/>sees that he must follow the counsel of the wise spirit, the dread<br/>spirit of death and destruction, and therefore accept lying and<br/>deception, and lead men consciously to death and destruction, and<br/>yet deceive them all the way so that they may not notice where they<br/>are being led, that the poor blind creatures may at least on the<br/>way think themselves happy. And note, the deception is in the name<br/>of Him in Whose ideal the old man had so fervently believed all his<br/>life long. Is not that tragic? And if only one such stood at the<br/>head of the whole army 'filled with the lust of power only for the<br/>sake of filthy gain'- would not one such be enough to make a<br/>tragedy? More than that, one such standing at the head is enough to<br/>create the actual leading idea of the Roman Church with all its<br/>armies and Jesuits, its highest idea. I tell you frankly that I<br/>firmly believe that there has always been such a man among those<br/>who stood at the head of the movement. Who knows, there may have<br/>been some such even among the Roman Popes. Who knows, perhaps the<br/>spirit of that accursed old man who loves mankind so obstinately in<br/>his own way, is to be found even now in a whole multitude of such<br/>old men, existing not by chance but by agreement, as a secret<br/>league formed long ago for the guarding of the mystery, to guard it<br/>from the weak and the unhappy, so as to make them happy. No doubt<br/>it is so, and so it must be indeed. I fancy that even among the<br/>Masons there's something of the same mystery at the bottom, and<br/>that that's why the Catholics so detest the Masons as their rivals<br/>breaking up the unity of the idea, while it is so essential that<br/>there should be one flock and one shepherd… . But from the way I<br/>defend my idea I might be an author impatient of your criticism.<br/>Enough of it." "You are perhaps a Mason yourself!" broke suddenly<br/>from Alyosha. "You don't believe in God," he added, speaking this<br/>time very sorrowfully. He fancied besides that his brother was<br/>looking at him ironically. "How does your poem end?" he asked,<br/>suddenly looking down. "Or was it the end?" "I meant to end it like<br/>this. When the Inquisitor ceased speaking he waited some time for<br/>his Prisoner to answer him. His silence weighed down upon him. He<br/>saw that the Prisoner had listened intently all the time, looking<br/>gently in his face and evidently not wishing to reply. The old man<br/>longed for him to say something, however bitter and terrible. But<br/>He suddenly approached the old man in silence and softly kissed him<br/>on his bloodless aged lips. That was all his answer. The old man<br/>shuddered. His lips moved. He went to the door, opened it, and said<br/>to Him: 'Go, and come no more… come not at all, never, never!' And<br/>he let Him out into the dark alleys of the town. The Prisoner went<br/>away." "And the old man?" "The kiss glows in his heart, but the old<br/>man adheres to his idea." "And you with him, you too?" cried<br/>Alyosha, mournfully. Ivan laughed. "Why, it's all nonsense,<br/>Alyosha. It's only a senseless poem of a senseless student, who<br/>could never write two lines of verse. Why do you take it so<br/>seriously? Surely you don't suppose I am going straight off to the<br/>Jesuits, to join the men who are correcting His work? Good Lord,<br/>it's no business of mine. I told you, all I want is to live on to<br/>thirty, and then… dash the cup to the ground!" "But the little<br/>sticky leaves, and the precious tombs, and the blue sky, and the<br/>woman you love! How will you live, how will you love them?" Alyosha<br/>cried sorrowfully. "With such a hell in your heart and your head,<br/>how can you? No, that's just what you are going away for, to join<br/>them… if not, you will kill yourself, you can't endure it!" "There<br/>is a strength to endure everything," Ivan said with a cold smile.<br/>"The strength of the Karamazovs- the strength of the Karamazov<br/>baseness." "To sink into debauchery, to stifle your soul with<br/>corruption, yes?" "Possibly even that… only perhaps till I am<br/>thirty I shall escape it, and then-" "How will you escape it? By<br/>what will you escape it? That's impossible with your ideas." "In<br/>the Karamazov way, again." "'Everything is lawful,' you mean?<br/>Everything is lawful, is that it?" Ivan scowled, and all at once<br/>turned strangely pale. "Ah, you've caught up yesterday's phrase,<br/>which so offended Muisov- and which Dmitri pounced upon so naively<br/>and paraphrased!" he smiled queerly. "Yes, if you like, 'everything<br/>is lawful' since the word has been said, I won't deny it. And<br/>Mitya's version isn't bad." Alyosha looked at him in silence. "I<br/>thought that going away from here I have you at least," Ivan said<br/>suddenly, with unexpected feeling; "but now I see that there is no<br/>place for me even in your heart, my dear hermit. The formula, 'all<br/>is lawful,' I won't renounce- will you renounce me for that, yes?"<br/>Alyosha got up, went to him and softly kissed him on the lips.<br/>"That's plagiarism," cried Ivan, highly delighted. "You stole that<br/>from my poem. Thank you though. Get up, Alyosha, it's time we were<br/>going, both of us." They went out, but stopped when they reached<br/>the entrance of the restaurant. "Listen, Alyosha," Ivan began in a<br/>resolute voice, "if I am really able to care for the sticky little<br/>leaves I shall only love them, remembering you. It's enough for me<br/>that you are somewhere here, and I shan't lose my desire for life<br/>yet. Is that enough for you? Take it as a declaration of love if<br/>you like. And now you go to the right and I to the left. And it's<br/>enough, do you hear, enough. I mean even if I don't go away<br/>to-morrow (I think I certainly shall go) and we meet again, don't<br/>say a word more on these subjects. I beg that particularly. And<br/>about Dmitri too, I ask you specially, never speak to me again," he<br/>added, with sudden irritation; "it's all exhausted, it has all been<br/>said over and over again, hasn't it? And I'll make you one promise<br/>in return for it. When at thirty, I want to 'dash the cup to the<br/>ground,' wherever I may be I'll come to have one more talk with<br/>you, even though it were from America, you may be sure of that.<br/>I'll come on purpose. It will be very interesting to have a look at<br/>you, to see what you'll be by that time. It's rather a solemn<br/>promise, you see. And we really may be parting for seven years or<br/>ten. Come, go now to your Pater Seraphicus, he is dying. If he dies<br/>without you, you will be angry with me for having kept you.<br/>Good-bye, kiss me once more; that's right, now go." Ivan turned<br/>suddenly and went his way without looking back. It was just as<br/>Dmitri had left Alyosha the day before, though the parting had been<br/>very different. The strange resemblance flashed like an arrow<br/>through Alyosha's mind in the distress and dejection of that<br/>moment. He waited a little, looking after his brother. He suddenly<br/>noticed that Ivan swayed as he walked and that his right shoulder<br/>looked lower than his left. He had never noticed it before. But all<br/>at once he turned too, and almost ran to the monastery. It was<br/>nearly dark, and he felt almost frightened; something new was<br/>growing up in him for which he could not account. The wind had<br/>risen again as on the previous evening, and the ancient pines<br/>murmured gloomily about him when he entered the hermitage copse. He<br/>almost ran. "Pater Seraphicus- he got that name from somewhere-<br/>where from?" Alyosha wondered. "Ivan, poor Ivan, and when shall I<br/>see you again?… Here is the hermitage. Yes, yes, that he is, Pater<br/>Seraphicus, he will save me- from him and for ever!" Several times<br/>afterwards he wondered how he could, on leaving Ivan, so completely<br/>forget his brother Dmitri, though he had that morning, only a few<br/>hours before, so firmly resolved to find him and not to give up<br/>doing so, even should he be unable to return to the monastery that<br/>night.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
