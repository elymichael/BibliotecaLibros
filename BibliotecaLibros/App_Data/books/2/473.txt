"You are awfully cross, because I don't talk about holy things.
I don't want to be holy. What will they do to one in the next world
for the greatest sin? You must know all about that."

"God will censure you." Alyosha was watching her steadily.

"That's just what I should like. I would go up and they would
censure me, and I would burst out laughing in their faces. I should
dreadfully like to set fire to the house, Alyosha, to our house;
you still don't believe me?"

"Why? There are children of twelve years old, who have a longing
to set fire to something and they do set things on fire, too. It's
a sort of disease."

"That's not true, that's not true; there may be children, but
that's not what I mean."

"You take evil for good; it's a passing crisis; it's the result
of your illness, perhaps."

"You do despise me, though! It's simply that I don't want to do
good, I want to do evil, and it has nothing to do with
illness."

"Why do evil?"

"So that everything might be destroyed. Ah, how nice it would be
if everything were destroyed! You know, Alyosha, I sometimes think
of doing a fearful lot of harm and everything bad, and I should do
it for a long while on the sly and suddenly everyone would find it
out. Everyone will stand round and point their fingers at me and I
would look at them all. That would be awfully nice. Why would it be
so nice, Alyosha?"

"I don't know. It's a craving to destroy something good or, as
you say, to set fire to something. It happens sometimes."
