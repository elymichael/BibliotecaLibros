<br/>"But why?" asked Alyosha. "It's all so far off. We may have to<br/>wait another year and a half."<br/><br/>"Ah, Alexey Fyodorovitch, that's true, of course, and you'll<br/>have time to quarrel and separate a thousand times in a year and a<br/>half. But I am so unhappy! Though it's such nonsense, it's a great<br/>blow to me. I feel like Famusov in the last scene of Sorrow from<br/>Wit. You are Tchatsky and she is Sofya, and, only fancy, I've run<br/>down to meet you on the stairs, and in the play the fatal scene<br/>takes place on the staircase. I heard it all; I almost dropped. So<br/>this is the explanation of her dreadful night and her hysterics of<br/>late! It means love to the daughter but death to the mother. I<br/>might as well be in my grave at once. And a more serious matter<br/>still, what is this letter she has written? Show it me at once, at<br/>once!"<br/><br/>"No, there's no need. Tell me, how is Katerina Ivanovna now? I<br/>must know."<br/><br/>"She still lies in delirium; she has not regained consciousness.<br/>Her aunts are here; but they do nothing but sigh and give<br/>themselves airs. Herzenstube came, and he was so alarmed that I<br/>didn't know what to do for him. I nearly sent for a doctor to look<br/>after him. He was driven home in my carriage. And on the top of it<br/>all, you and this letter! It's true nothing can happen for a year<br/>and a half. In the name of all that's holy, in the name of your<br/>dying elder, show me that letter, Alexey Fyodorovitch. I'm her<br/>mother. Hold it in your hand, if you like, and I will read it<br/>so."<br/><br/>"No, I won't show it to you. Even if she sanctioned it, I<br/>wouldn't. I am coming to-morrow, and if you like, we can talk over<br/>many things, but now good-bye!"<br/><br/>And Alyosha ran downstairs and into the street.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
