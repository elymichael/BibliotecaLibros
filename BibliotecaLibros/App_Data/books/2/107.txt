She slowly raised the hands to her lips, with the strange object
indeed of "being even" with her in kisses.

Katerina Ivanovna did not take her hand away. She listened with
timid hope to the last words, though Grushenka's promise to do her
bidding like a slave was very strangely expressed. She looked
intently into her eyes; she still saw in those eyes the same
simple-hearted, confiding expression, the same bright gaiety.

"She's perhaps too naive," thought Katerina Ivanovna, with a
gleam of hope.

Grushenka meanwhile seemed enthusiastic over the "sweet hand."
She raised it deliberately to her lips. But she held it for two or
three minutes near her lips, as though reconsidering something.

"Do you know, angel lady," she suddenly drawled in an even more
soft and sugary voice, "do you know, after all, I think I won't
kiss your hand?" And she laughed a little merry laugh.

"As you please. What's the matter with you?" said Katerina
Ivanovna, starting suddenly.

"So that you may be left to remember that you kissed my hand,
but I didn't kiss yours."

There was a sudden gleam in her eyes. She looked with awful
intentness at Katerina Ivanovna.

"Insolent creature!" cried Katerina Ivanovna, as though suddenly
grasping something. She flushed all over and leapt up from her
seat.

Grushenka too got up, but without haste.

"So I shall tell Mitya how you kissed my hand, but I didn't kiss
yours at all. And how he will laugh!"
