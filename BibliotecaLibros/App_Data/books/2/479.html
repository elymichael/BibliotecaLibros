Give my love to Mitya, go, go!"<br/><br/>And she almost forcibly pushed Alyosha out of the door. He<br/>looked at her with pained surprise, when he was suddenly aware of a<br/>letter in his right hand, a tiny letter folded up tight and sealed.<br/>He glanced at it and instantly read the address, "To Ivan<br/>Fyodorovitch Karamazov."

Ten seconds after, releasing her finger, she<br/>walked softly, slowly to her chair, sat up straight in it and<br/>looked intently at her blackened finger and at the blood that oozed<br/>from under the nail. Her lips were quivering and she kept<br/>whispering rapidly to herself:<br/><br/>"I am a wretch, wretch, wretch, wretch!"<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
