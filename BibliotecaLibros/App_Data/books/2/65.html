<br/>God had not blessed them with children. One child was born but<br/>it died. Grigory was fond of children, and was not ashamed of<br/>showing it. When Adelaida Ivanovna had run away, Grigory took<br/>Dmitri, then a child of three years old, combed his hair and washed<br/>him in a tub with his own hands, and looked after him for almost a<br/>year. Afterwards he had looked after Ivan and Alyosha, for which<br/>the general's widow had rewarded him with a slap in the face; but I<br/>have already related all that. The only happiness his own child had<br/>brought him had been in the anticipation of its birth. When it was<br/>born, he was overwhelmed with grief and horror. The baby had six<br/>fingers. Grigory was so crushed by this, that he was not only<br/>silent till the day of the christening, but kept away in the<br/>garden. It was spring, and he spent three days digging the kitchen<br/>garden. The third day was fixed for christening the baby: meantime<br/>Grigory had reached a conclusion. Going into the cottage where the<br/>clergy were assembled and the visitors had arrived, including<br/>Fyodor Pavlovitch, who was to stand godfather, he suddenly<br/>announced that the baby "ought not to be christened at all." He<br/>announced this quietly, briefly, forcing out his words, and gazing<br/>with dull intentness at the priest.<br/><br/>"Why not?" asked the priest with good-humoured surprise.<br/><br/>"Because it's a dragon," muttered Grigory.<br/><br/>"A dragon? What dragon?"<br/><br/>Grigory did not speak for some time. "It's a confusion of<br/>nature," he muttered vaguely, but firmly, and obviously unwilling<br/>to say more.<br/><br/>They laughed, and, of course, christened the poor baby. Grigory<br/>prayed earnestly at the font, but his opinion of the new-born child<br/>remained unchanged. Yet he did not interfere in any way. As long as<br/>the sickly infant lived he scarcely looked at it, tried indeed not<br/>to notice it, and for the most part kept out of the cottage. But<br/>when, at the end of a fortnight, the baby died of thrush, he<br/>himself laid the child in its little coffin, looked at it in<br/>profound grief, and when they were filling up the shallow little<br/>grave he fell on his knees and bowed down to the earth. He did not<br/>for years afterwards mention his child, nor did Marfa speak of the<br/>baby before him, and, even if Grigory were not present, she never<br/>spoke of it above a whisper. Marfa observed that, from the day of<br/>the burial, he devoted himself to "religion," and took to reading<br/>the Lives of the Saints, for the most part sitting alone and in<br/>silence, and always putting on his big, round, silver-rimmed<br/>spectacles. He rarely read aloud, only perhaps in Lent. He was fond<br/>of the Book of Job, and had somehow got hold of a copy of the<br/>sayings and sermons of "the God fearing Father Isaac the Syrian,<br/>which he read persistently for years together, understanding very<br/>little of it, but perhaps prizing and loving it the more for that.<br/>Of late he had begun to listen to the doctrines of the sect of<br/>Flagellants settled in the neighbourhood. He was evidently shaken<br/>by them, but judged it unfitting to go over to the new faith. His<br/>habit of theological reading gave him an expression of still<br/>greater gravity.<br/><br/>He was perhaps predisposed to mysticism. And the birth of his<br/>deformed child, and its death, had, as though by special design,<br/>been accompanied by another strange and marvellous event, which, as<br/>he said later, had left a "stamp" upon his soul. It happened that,<br/>on the very night after the burial of his child, Marfa was awakened<br/>by the wail of a new-born baby. She was frightened and waked her<br/>husband. He listened and said he thought it was more like someone<br/>groaning, "it might be a woman." He got up and dressed. It was a<br/>rather warm night in May. As he went down the steps, he distinctly<br/>heard groans coming from the garden. But the gate from the yard<br/>into the garden was locked at night, and there was no other way of<br/>entering it, for it was enclosed all round by a strong, high fence.<br/>Going back into the house, Grigory lighted a lantern, took the<br/>garden key, and taking no notice of the hysterical fears of his<br/>wife, who was still persuaded that she heard a child crying, and<br/>that it was her own baby crying and calling for her, went into the<br/>garden in silence. There he heard at once that the groans came from<br/>the bath-house that stood near the garden gate, and that they were<br/>the groans of a woman. Opening the door of the bath-house, he saw a<br/>sight which petrified him. An idiot girl, who wandered about the<br/>streets and was known to the whole town by the nickname of Lizaveta<br/>Smerdyastchaya (Stinking Lizaveta), had got into the bath-house and<br/>had just given birth to a child. She lay dying with the baby beside<br/>her. She said nothing, for she had never been able to speak. But<br/>her story needs a chapter to itself.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
