"There's no phantom here, but only us two and one other. No
doubt he is here, that third, between us."

"Who is he? Who is here? What third person?" Ivan cried in
alarm, looking about him, his eyes hastily searching in every
corner.

"That third is God Himself- Providence. He is the third beside
us now. Only don't look for Him, you won't find him."

"It's a lie that you killed him!" Ivan cried madly. "You are
mad, or teasing me again!"

Smerdyakov, as before, watched him curiously, with no sign of
fear. He could still scarcely get over his incredulity; he still
fancied that Ivan knew everything and was trying to "throw it all
on him to his face."

"Wait a minute," he said at last in a weak voice, and suddenly
bringing up his left leg from under the table, he began turning up
his trouser leg. He was wearing long white stockings and slippers.
Slowly he took off his garter and fumbled to the bottom of his
stocking. Ivan gazed at him, and suddenly shuddered in a paroxysm
of terror.

"He's mad!" he cried, and rapidly jumping up, he drew back, so
that he knocked his back against the wall and stood up against it,
stiff and straight. He looked with insane terror at Smerdyakov,
who, entirely unaffected by his terror, continued fumbling in his
stocking, as though he were making an effort to get hold of
something with his fingers and pull it out. At last he got hold of
it and began pulling it out. Ivan saw that it was a piece of paper,
or perhaps a roll of papers. Smerdyakov pulled it out and laid it
on the table.

"Here," he said quietly.

"What is it?" asked Ivan, trembling.

"Kindly look at it," Smerdyakov answered, still in the same low
tone.
