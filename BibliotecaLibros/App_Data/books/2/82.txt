"No one else. He will let me know if she goes to the old
man."

"It was he told you about the money, then?"

"Yes. It's a dead secret. Even Ivan doesn't know about the
money, or anything. The old man is sending Ivan to Tchermashnya on
a two or three days' journey. A purchaser has turned up for the
copse: he'll give eight thousand for the timber. So the old man
keeps asking Ivan to help him by going to arrange it. It will take
him two or three days. That's what the old man wants, so that
Grushenka can come while he's away."

"Then he's expecting Grushenka to-day?"

"No, she won't come to-day; there are signs, She's certain not
to come," cried Mitya suddenly. "Smerdyakov thinks so, too.
Father's drinking now. He's sitting at table with Ivan. Go to him,
Alyosha, and ask for the three thousand."

"Mitya, dear, what's the matter with you?" cried Alyosha,
jumping up from his place, and looking keenly at his brother's
frenzied face. For one moment the thought struck him that Dmitri
was mad.

"What is it? I'm not insane," said Dmitri, looking intently and
earnestly at him. "No fear. I am sending you to father, and I know
what I'm saying. I believe in miracles."

"In miracles?"

"In a miracle of Divine Providence. God knows my heart. He sees
my despair. He sees the whole picture. Surely He won't let
something awful happen. Alyosha, I believe in miracles. Go!"

"I am going. Tell me, will you wait for me here?"
