<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>9<br/>The Sensualists<br/><br/><br/>GRIGORY and Smerdyakov ran into the room after Dmitri. They had<br/>been struggling with him in the passage, refusing to admit him,<br/>acting on instructions given them by Fyodor Pavlovitch some days<br/>before. Taking advantage of the fact that Dmitri stopped a moment<br/>on entering the room to look about him, Grigory ran round the<br/>table, closed the double doors on the opposite side of the room<br/>leading to the inner apartments, and stood before the closed doors,<br/>stretching wide his arms, prepared to defend the entrance, so to<br/>speak, with the last drop of his blood. Seeing this, Dmitri uttered<br/>a scream rather than a shout and rushed at Grigory.<br/><br/>"Then she's there! She's hidden there! Out of the way,<br/>scoundrel!"<br/><br/>He tried to pull Grigory away, but the old servant pushed him<br/>back. Beside himself with fury, Dmitri struck out, and hit Grigory<br/>with all his might. The old man fell like a log, and Dmitri,<br/>leaping over him, broke in the door. Smerdyakov remained pale and<br/>trembling at the other end of the room, huddling close to Fyodor<br/>Pavlovitch.<br/><br/>"She's here!" shouted Dmitri. "I saw her turn towards the house<br/>just now, but I couldn't catch her. Where is she? Where is<br/>she?"<br/><br/>That shout, "She's here!" produced an indescribable effect on<br/>Fyodor Pavlovitch. All his terror left him.<br/><br/>"Hold him! Hold him!" he cried, and dashed after Dmitri.<br/>Meanwhile Grigory had got up from the floor, but still seemed<br/>stunned. Ivan and Alyosha ran after their father. In the third room<br/>something was heard to fall on the floor with a ringing crash: it<br/>was a large glass vase- not an expensive one- on a marble pedestal<br/>which Dmitri had upset as he ran past it.<br/><br/>"At him!" shouted the old man. "Help!"<br/>
