<br/>"On purpose?" queried Alyosha.<br/><br/>"I tell you you are silly, Alyosha. You know nothing about it,<br/>with all your cleverness. I am not offended that he is jealous of a<br/>girl like me. I would be offended if he were not jealous. I am like<br/>that. I am not offended at jealousy. I have a fierce heart, too. I<br/>can be jealous myself. Only what offends me is that he doesn't love<br/>me at all. I tell you he is jealous now on purpose. Am I blind?<br/>Don't I see? He began talking to me just now of that woman, of<br/>Katerina, saying she was this and that, how she had ordered a<br/>doctor from Moscow for him, to try and save him; how she had<br/>ordered the best counsel, the most learned one, too. So he loves<br/>her, if he'll praise her to my face, more shame to him! He's<br/>treated me badly himself, so he attacked me, to make out I am in<br/>fault first and to throw it all on me. 'You were with your Pole<br/>before me, so I can't be blamed for Katerina,' that's what it<br/>amounts to. He wants to throw the whole blame on me. He attacked me<br/>on purpose, on purpose, I tell you, but I'll-"<br/><br/>Grushenka could not finish saying what she would do. She hid her<br/>eyes in her handkerchief and sobbed violently.<br/><br/>"He doesn't love Katerina Ivanovna," said Alyosha firmly.<br/><br/>"Well, whether he loves her or not, I'll soon find out for<br/>myself," said Grushenka, with a menacing note in her voice, taking<br/>the handkerchief from her eyes. Her face was distorted. Alyosha saw<br/>sorrowfully that from being mild and serene, it had become sullen<br/>and spiteful.<br/><br/>"Enough of this foolishness," she said suddenly; "it's not for<br/>that I sent for you. Alyosha, darling, to-morrow- what will happen<br/>to-morrow? That's what worries me! And it's only me it worries! I<br/>look at everyone and no one is thinking of it. No one cares about<br/>it. Are you thinking about it even? To-morrow he'll be tried, you<br/>know. Tell me, how will he be tried? You know it's the valet, the<br/>valet killed him! Good heavens! Can they condemn him in place of<br/>the valet and will no one stand up for him? They haven't troubled<br/>the valet at all, have they?"<br/><br/>"He's been severely cross-examined," observed Alyosha<br/>thoughtfully; "but everyone came to the conclusion it was not he.<br/>Now he is lying very ill. He has been ill ever since that attack.<br/>Really ill," added Alyosha.<br/><br/>"Oh, dear! couldn't you go to that counsel yourself and tell him<br/>the whole thing by yourself? He's been brought from Petersburg for<br/>three thousand roubles, they say."<br/><br/>"We gave these three thousand together- Ivan, Katerina Ivanovna<br/>and I- but she paid two thousand for the doctor from Moscow<br/>herself. The counsel Fetyukovitch would have charged more, but the<br/>case has become known all over Russia; it's talked of in all the<br/>papers and journals. Fetyukovitch agreed to come more for the glory<br/>of the thing, because the case has become so notorious. I saw him<br/>yesterday."<br/><br/>"Well? Did you talk to him?" Grushenka put in eagerly.<br/><br/>
