"I believed, I believe, I want to believe, and I will believe,
what more do you want?" cried Alyosha irritably.

"Nothing at all, my boy. Damn it all! why, no schoolboy of
thirteen believes in that now. But there… So now you are in a
temper with your God, you are rebelling against Him; He hasn't
given promotion, He hasn't bestowed the order of merit! Eh, you are
a set!"

Alyosha gazed a long while with his eyes half closed at Rakitin,
and there was a sudden gleam in his eyes… but not of anger with
Rakitin.

"I am not rebelling against my God; I simply 'don't accept His
world.'" Alyosha suddenly smiled a forced smile.

"How do you mean, you don't accept the world?" Rakitin thought a
moment over his answer. "What idiocy is this?"

Alyosha did not answer.

"Come, enough nonsense, now to business. Have you had anything
to eat to-day?"

"I don't remember… . I think I have."

"You need keeping up, to judge by your face. It makes one sorry
to look at you. You didn't sleep all night either, I hear; you had
a meeting in there. And then all this bobbery afterwards. Most
likely you've had nothing to eat but a mouthful of holy bread. I've
got some sausage in my pocket; I've brought it from the town in
case of need, only you won't eat sausage… ."

"Give me some."

"I say! You are going it! Why, it's a regular mutiny, with
barricades! Well, my boy, we must make the most of it. Come to my
place… shouldn't mind a drop of vodka myself, I am tired to death.
Vodka is going too far for you, I suppose… or would you like
some?"
