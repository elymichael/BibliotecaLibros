I don't intend to grieve at all.

Then something unexpected happened. Alyosha suddenly sneezed.
They were silent. Alyosha got up and walked towards them. He found
Smerdyakov dressed up and wearing polished boots, his hair pomaded,
and perhaps curled. The guitar lay on the garden-seat. His
companion was the daughter of the house, wearing a light-blue dress
with a train two yards long. She was young and would not have been
bad-looking, but that her face was so round and terribly
freckled.

"Will my brother Dmitri soon be back? asked Alyosha with as much
composure as he could.

Smerdyakov got up slowly; Marya Kondratyevna rose too.

"How am I to know about Dmitri Fyodorovitch? It's not as if I
were his keeper," answered Smerdyakov quietly, distinctly, and
superciliously.

"But I simply asked whether you do know?" Alyosha explained.

"I know nothing of his whereabouts and don't want to."

"But my brother told me that you let him know all that goes on
in the house, and promised to let him know when Agrafena
Alexandrovna comes."

Smerdyakov turned a deliberate, unmoved glance upon him.

"And how did you get in this time, since the gate was bolted an
hour ago?" he asked, looking at Alyosha.
