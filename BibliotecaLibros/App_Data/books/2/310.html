<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>7<br/>The First and Rightful Lover<br/><br/><br/>WITH his long, rapid strides, Mitya walked straight up to the<br/>table.<br/><br/>"Gentlemen," he said in a loud voice, almost shouting, yet<br/>stammering at every word, "I… I'm all right! Don't be afraid!" he<br/>exclaimed, "I- there's nothing the matter," he turned suddenly to<br/>Grushenka, who had shrunk back in her chair towards Kalganov, and<br/>clasped his hand tightly. "I… I'm coming, too. I'm here till<br/>morning. Gentlemen, may I stay with you till morning? Only till<br/>morning, for the last time, in this same room?"<br/><br/>So he finished, turning to the fat little man, with the pipe,<br/>sitting on the sofa. The latter removed his pipe from his lips with<br/>dignity and observed severely:<br/><br/>"Panie,* we're here in private. There are other rooms."<br/><br/>* Pan and Panie mean Mr. in Polish. Pani means Mrs., Panovie,<br/>gentlemen.<br/><br/>"Why, it's you, Dmitri Fyodorovitch! What do you mean?" answered<br/>Kalgonov suddenly. "Sit down with us. How are you?"<br/><br/>"Delighted to see you, dear… and precious fellow, I always<br/>thought a lot of you." Mitya responded, joyfully and eagerly, at<br/>once holding out his hand across the table.<br/>
