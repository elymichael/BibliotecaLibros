<br/>"What do you mean? How can you? Why?" cried Alyosha<br/>surprised.<br/><br/>"Oh, if I, too, could sacrifice myself some day for truth!" said<br/>Kolya with enthusiasm.<br/><br/>"But not in such a cause, not with such disgrace and such<br/>horrer!" said Alyosha.<br/><br/>"Of courseâ€¦ I should like to die for all humanity, and as for<br/>disgrace, I don't care about that- our names may perish. I respect<br/>your brother!"<br/><br/>"And so do I!" the boy, who had once declared that he knew who<br/>had founded Troy, cried suddenly and unexpectedly, and he blushed<br/>up to his ears like a peony as he had done on that occasion.<br/><br/>Alyosha went into the room. Ilusha lay with his hands folded and<br/>his eyes closed in a blue coffin with a white frill round it. His<br/>thin face was hardly changed at all, and strange to say there was<br/>no smell of decay from the corpse. The expression of his face was<br/>serious and, as it were, thoughtful. His hands, crossed over his<br/>breast, looked particularly beautiful, as though chiselled in<br/>marble. There were flowers in his hands and the coffin, with<br/>flowers, which had been sent early in the morning by Lise Hohlakov.<br/>But there were flowers too from Katerina Ivanovna, and when Alyosha<br/>opened the door, the captain had a bunch in his trembling hands and<br/>was strewing them again over his dear boy. He scarcely glanced at<br/>Alyosha when he came in, and he would not look at anyone, even at<br/>his crazy weeping wife, "mamma," who kept trying to stand on her<br/>crippled legs to get a nearer look at her dead boy. Nina had been<br/>pushed in her chair by the boys close up to the coffin. She sat<br/>with her head pressed to it and she too was no doubt quietly<br/>weeping. Snegiryov's face looked eager, yet bewildered and<br/>exasperated. There was something crazy about his gestures and the<br/>words that broke from him. "Old man, dear old man!" he exclaimed<br/>every minute, gazing at Ilusha. It was his habit to call Ilusha<br/>"old man," as a term of affection when he was alive.<br/><br/>"Father, give me a flower, too; take that white one out of his<br/>hand and give it me," the crazy mother begged, whimpering. Either<br/>because the little white rose in Ilusha's hand had caught her fancy<br/>or that she wanted one from his hand to keep in memory of him, she<br/>moved restlessly, stretching out her hands for the flower.<br/><br/>"I won't give it to anyone, I won't give you anything,"<br/>Snegiryov cried callously. "They are his flowers, not yours!<br/>Everything is his, nothing is yours!"<br/><br/>"Father, give mother a flower!" said Nina, lifting her face wet<br/>with tears.<br/><br/>"I won't give away anything and to her less than anyone! She<br/>didn't love Ilusha. She took away his little cannon and he gave it<br/>to her," the captain broke into loud sobs at the thought of how<br/>Ilusha had given up his cannon to his mother. The poor, crazy<br/>creature was bathed in noiseless tears, hiding her face in her<br/>hands.<br/><br/>
