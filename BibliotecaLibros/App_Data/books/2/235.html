<br/>"Give me some vodka too."<br/><br/>"Hullo! You surprise me, brother!" Rakitin looked at him in<br/>amazement. "Well, one way or another, vodka or sausage, this is a<br/>jolly fine chance and mustn't be missed. Come along."<br/><br/>Alyosha got up in silence and followed Rakitin.<br/><br/>"If your little brother Ivan could see this wouldn't he be<br/>surprised! By the way, your brother Ivan set off to Moscow this<br/>morning, did you know?"<br/><br/>"Yes," answered Alyosha listlessly, and suddenly the image of<br/>his brother Dmitri rose before his mind. But only for a minute, and<br/>though it reminded him of something that must not be put off for a<br/>moment, some duty, some terrible obligation, even that reminder<br/>made no impression on him, did not reach his heart and instantly<br/>faded out of his mind and was forgotten. But, a long while<br/>afterwards, Alyosha remembered this.<br/><br/>"Your brother Ivan declared once that I was a 'liberal booby<br/>with no talents whatsoever.' Once you, too, could not resist<br/>letting me know I was 'dishonourable.' Well! I should like to see<br/>what your talents and sense of honour will do for you now." This<br/>phrase Rakitin finished to himself in a whisper.<br/><br/>"Listen!" he said aloud, "Let's go by the path beyond the<br/>monastery straight to the town. H'm! I ought to go to Madame<br/>Hohlakov's by the way. Only fancy, I've written to tell her<br/>everything that happened, and would you believe it, she answered me<br/>instantly in pencil (the lady has a passion for writing notes) that<br/>'she would never have expected such conduct from a man of such a<br/>reverend character as Father Zossima.' That was her very word:<br/>'conduct.' She is angry too. Eh, you are a set! Stay!" he cried<br/>suddenly again. He suddenly stopped and taking Alyosha by the<br/>shoulder made him stop too.<br/><br/>"Do you know, Alyosha," he peeped inquisitively into his eyes,<br/>absorbed in a sudden new thought which had dawned on him, and<br/>though he was laughing outwardly he was evidently afraid to utter<br/>that new idea aloud, so difficult he still found it to believe in<br/>the strange and unexpected mood in which he now saw Alyosha.<br/>"Alyosha, do you know where we had better go?" he brought out at<br/>last timidly, and insinuatingly.<br/><br/>"I don't careâ€¦ where you like."<br/><br/>"Let's go to Grushenka, eh? Will you come?" pronounced Rakitin<br/>at last, trembling with timid suspense.<br/><br/>
