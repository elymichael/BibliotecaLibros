A
Young Man Bent on a Career


ALYOSHA helped Father Zossima to his bedroom and seated him on
his bed. It was a little room furnished with the bare necessities.
There was a narrow iron bedstead, with a strip of felt for a
mattress. In the corner, under the ikons, was a reading-desk with a
cross and the Gospel lying on it. The elder sank exhausted on the
bed. His eyes glittered and he breathed hard. He looked intently at
Alyosha, as though considering something.

"Go, my dear boy, go. Porfiry is enough for me. Make haste, you
are needed there, go and wait at the Father Superior's table."

"Let me stay here," Alyosha entreated.

"You are more needed there. There is no peace there. You will
wait, and be of service. If evil spirits rise up, repeat a prayer.
And remember, my son"- the elder liked to call him that- "this is
not the place for you in the future. When it is God's will to call
me, leave the monastery. Go away for good."

Alyosha started.

"What is it? This is not your place for the time. I bless you
for great service in the world. Yours will be a long pilgrimage.
And you will have to take a wife, too. You will have to bear all
before you come back. There will be much to do. But I don't doubt
of you, and so I send you forth. Christ is with you. Do not abandon
Him and He will not abandon you. You will see great sorrow, and in
that sorrow you will be happy. This is my last message to you: in
sorrow seek happiness. Work, work unceasingly. Remember my words,
for although I shall talk with you again, not only my days but my
hours are numbered."

Alyosha's face again betrayed strong emotion. The corners of his
mouth quivered.
