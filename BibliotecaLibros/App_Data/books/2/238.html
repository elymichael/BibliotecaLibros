<br/>These were the very words of the old profligate, who felt<br/>already that his death was not far off and who actually died five<br/>months later.<br/><br/>I will note too, in passing- that although many in our town knew<br/>of the grotesque and monstrous rivalry of the Karamazovs, father<br/>and son, the object of which was Grushenka, scarcely anyone<br/>understood what really underlay her attitude to both of them. Even<br/>Grushenka's two servants (after the catastrophe of which we will<br/>speak later) testified in court that she received Dmitri<br/>Fyodorovitch simply from fear because "he threatened to murder<br/>her." These servants were an old cook, invalidish and almost deaf,<br/>who came from Grushenka's old home, and her granddaughter, a smart<br/>young girl of twenty, who performed the duties of a maid. Grushenka<br/>lived very economically and her surroundings were anything but<br/>luxurious. Her lodge consisted of three rooms furnished with<br/>mahogany furniture in the fashion of 1820, belonging to her<br/>landlady.<br/><br/>It was quite dark when Rakitin and Alyosha entered her rooms,<br/>yet they were not lighted up. Grushenka was lying down in her<br/>drawing-room on the big, hard, clumsy sofa, with a mahogany back.<br/>The sofa was covered with shabby and ragged leather. Under her head<br/>she had two white down pillows taken from her bed. She was lying<br/>stretched out motionless on her back with her hands behind her<br/>head. She was dressed as though expecting someone, in a black silk<br/>dress, with a dainty lace fichu on her head, which was very<br/>becoming. Over her shoulders was thrown a lace shawl pinned with a<br/>massive gold brooch. She certainly was expecting someone. She lay<br/>as though impatient and weary, her face rather pale and her lips<br/>and eyes hot, restlessly tapping the arm of the sofa with the tip<br/>of her right foot. The appearance of Rakitin and Alyosha caused a<br/>slight excitement. From the hall they could hear Grushenka leap up<br/>from the sofa and cry out in a frightened voice, "Who's there?" But<br/>the maid met the visitors and at once called back to her<br/>mistress.<br/><br/>"It's not he, it's nothing, only other visitors."<br/><br/>"What can be the matter?" muttered Rakitin, leading Alyosha into<br/>the drawing-room.<br/><br/>Grushenka was standing by the sofa as though still alarmed. A<br/>thick coil of her dark brown hair escaped from its lace covering<br/>and fell on her right shoulder, but she did not notice it and did<br/>not put it back till she had gazed at her visitors and recognised<br/>them.<br/><br/>"Ah, it's you, Rakitin? You quite frightened me. Whom have you<br/>brought? Who is this with you? Good heavens, you have brought him!"<br/>she exclaimed, recognising Alyosha.<br/><br/>"Do send for candles!" said Rakitin, with the free-and-easy air<br/>of a most intimate friend, who is privileged to give orders in the<br/>house.<br/><br/>"Candles… of course, candles… . Fenya, fetch him a candle… .<br/>Well, you have chosen a moment to bring him! she exclaimed again,<br/>nodding towards Alyosha, and turning to the looking-glass she began<br/>quickly fastening up her hair with both hands. She seemed<br/>displeased.<br/><br/>"Haven't I managed to please you?" asked Rakitin, instantly<br/>almost offended.<br/><br/>
