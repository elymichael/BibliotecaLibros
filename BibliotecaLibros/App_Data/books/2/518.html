<br/>"If he did not kill him, of course, I would not have ventured to<br/>take the money, and nothing would have happened. But I calculated<br/>that he would beat him senseless, and I should have time to take it<br/>then, and then I'd make out to Fyodor Pavlovitch that it was no one<br/>but Dmitri Fyodorovitch who had taken the money after beating<br/>him."<br/><br/>"Stop… I am getting mixed. Then it was Dmitri after all who<br/>killed him; you only took the money?"<br/><br/>"No, he didn't kill him. Well, I might as well have told you now<br/>that he was the murderer… . But I don't want to lie to you now<br/>because… because if you really haven't understood till now, as I<br/>see for myself, and are not pretending, so as to throw your guilt<br/>on me to my very face, you are still responsible for it all, since<br/>you knew of the murder and charged me to do it, and went away<br/>knowing all about it. And so I want to prove to your face this<br/>evening that you are the only real murderer in the whole affair,<br/>and I am not the real murderer, though I did kill him. You are the<br/>rightful murderer."<br/><br/>"Why, why, am I a murderer? Oh, God!" Ivan cried, unable to<br/>restrain himself at last, and forgetting that he had put off<br/>discussing himself till the end of the conversation. "You still<br/>mean that Tchermashnya? Stay, tell me, why did you want my consent,<br/>if you really took Tchermashnya for consent? How will you explain<br/>that now?"<br/><br/>"Assured of your consent, I should have known that you wouldn't<br/>have made an outcry over those three thousand being lost, even if<br/>I'd been suspected, instead of Dmitri Fyodorovitch, or as his<br/>accomplice; on the contrary, you would have protected me from<br/>others… . And when you got your inheritance you would have rewarded<br/>me when you were able, all the rest of your life. For you'd have<br/>received your inheritance through me, seeing that if he had married<br/>Agrafena Alexandrovna, you wouldn't have had a farthing."<br/><br/>"Ah! Then you intended to worry me all my life afterwards,"<br/>snarled Ivan. "And what if I hadn't gone away then, but had<br/>informed against you?"<br/><br/>"What could you have informed? That I persuaded you to go to<br/>Tcherinashnya? That's all nonsense. Besides, after our conversation<br/>you would either have gone away or have stayed. If you had stayed,<br/>nothing would have happened. I should have known that you didn't<br/>want it done, and should have attempted nothing. As you went away,<br/>it meant you assured me that you wouldn't dare to inform against me<br/>at the trial, and that you'd overlook my having the three thousand.<br/>And, indeed, you couldn't have prosecuted me afterwards, because<br/>then I should have told it all in the court; that is, not that I<br/>had stolen the money or killed him- I shouldn't have said that- but<br/>that you'd put me up to the theft and the murder, though I didn't<br/>consent to it. That's why I needed your consent, so that you<br/>couldn't have cornered me afterwards, for what proof could you have<br/>had? I could always have cornered you, revealing your eagerness for<br/>your father's death, and I tell you the public would have believed<br/>it all, and you would have been ashamed for the rest of your<br/>life."<br/><br/>"Was I then so eager, was I?" Ivan snarled again.<br/><br/>"To be sure you were, and by your consent you silently<br/>sanctioned my doing it." Smerdyakov looked resolutely at Ivan. He<br/>was very weak and spoke slowly and wearily, but some hidden inner<br/>force urged him on. He evidently had some design. Ivan felt<br/>that.<br/><br/>"Go on," he said. "Tell me what happened that night."<br/><br/>
