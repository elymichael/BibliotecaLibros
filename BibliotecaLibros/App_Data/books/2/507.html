Ivan did not go home, but went straight to Katerina Ivanovna and<br/>alarmed her by his appearance. He was like a madman. He repeated<br/>all his conversation with Smerdyakov, every syllable of it. He<br/>couldn't be calmed, however much she tried to soothe him: he kept<br/>walking about the room, speaking strangely, disconnectedly. At last<br/>he sat down, put his elbows on the table, leaned his head on his<br/>hands and pronounced this strange sentence: "If it's not Dmitri,<br/>but Smerdyakov who's the murderer, I share his guilt, for I put him<br/>up to it. Whether I did, I don't know yet. But if he is the<br/>murderer, and not Dmitri, then, of course, I am the murderer,<br/>too."<br/><br/>When Katerina Ivanovna heard that, she got up from her seat<br/>without a word, went to her writing-table, opened a box standing on<br/>it, took out a sheet of paper and laid it before Ivan. This was the<br/>document of which Ivan spoke to Alyosha later on as a "conclusive<br/>proof" that Dmitri had killed his father. It was the letter written<br/>by Mitya to Katerina Ivanovna when he was drunk, on the very<br/>evening he met Alyosha at the crossroads on the way to the<br/>monastery, after the scene at Katerina Ivanovna's, when Grushenka<br/>had insulted her. Then, parting from Alyosha, Mitya had rushed to<br/>Grushenka. I don't know whether he saw her, but in the evening he<br/>was at the Metropolis, where he got thoroughly drunk. Then he asked<br/>for pen and paper and wrote a document of weighty consequences to<br/>himself. It was a wordy, disconnected, frantic letter, a drunken<br/>letter, in fact. It was like the talk of a drunken man, who, on his<br/>return home, begins with extraordinary heat telling his wife or one<br/>of his household how he has just been insulted, what a rascal had<br/>just insulted him, what a fine fellow he is on the other hand, and<br/>how he will pay that scoundrel out; and all that at great length,<br/>with great excitement and incoherence, with drunken tears and blows<br/>on the table. The letter was written on a dirty piece of ordinary<br/>paper of the cheapest kind. It had been provided by the tavern and<br/>there were figures scrawled on the back of it. There was evidently<br/>not space enough for his drunken verbosity and Mitya not only<br/>filled the margins but had written the last line right across the<br/>rest. The letter ran as follows:<br/><br/>FATAL KATYA: To-morrow I will get the money and repay your three<br/>thousand and farewell, woman of great wrath, but farewell, too, my<br/>love! Let us make an end! To-morrow I shall try and get it from<br/>everyone, and if I can't borrow it, I give you my word of honour I<br/>shall go to my father and break his skull and take the money from<br/>under the pillow, if only Ivan has gone. It I have to go to Siberia<br/>for it, I'll give you back your three thousand. And farewell. I bow<br/>down to the ground before you, for I've been a scoundrel to you.<br/>Forgive me! No, better not forgive me, you'll be happier and so<br/>shall I! Better Siberia than your love, for I love another woman<br/>and you got to know her too well to-day, so how can you forgive? I<br/>will murder the man who's robbed me! I'll leave you all and go to<br/>the East so as to see no one again. Not her either, for you are not<br/>my only tormentress; she is too. Farewel!<br/><br/>P.S.- I write my curse, but I adore you! I hear it in my<br/>heart.<br/><br/>One string is left, and it vibrates. Better tear my heart in<br/>two! I shall kill myself, but first of all that cur. I shall tear<br/>three thousand from him and fling it to you. Though I've been a<br/>scoundrel to you, I am not a thief! You can expect three thousand.<br/>The cur keeps it under his mattress, in pink ribbon. I am not a<br/>thief, but I'll murder my thief. Katya, don't look disdainful.<br/>Dmitri is not a thief! but a murderer! He has murdered his father<br/>and ruined himself to hold his ground, rather than endure your<br/>pride. And he doesn't love<br/><br/>you.<br/><br/>&gt; P.P.S.- I kiss your feet, farewel!<br/><br/>&gt; P.P.P.S.- Katya, pray to God that someone'll give me the<br/>money.<br/><br/>Then I shall not be steeped in gore, and if no one does- I<br/>shall! Kill me!<br/><br/>Your slave and enemy,<br/><br/>D. KARAMAZOV<br/>
