"Vile slut! Go away!"

"Ah, for shame, young lady! Ah, for shame! That's unbecoming for
you, dear young lady, a word like that."

"Go away! You're a creature for sale" screamed Katerina
Ivanovna. Every feature was working in her utterly distorted
face.

"For sale indeed! You used to visit gentlemen in the dusk for
money once; you brought your beauty for sale. You see, I know."

Katerina Ivanovna shrieked, and would have rushed at her, but
Alyosha held her with all his strength.

"Not a step, not a word! Don't speak, don't answer her. She'll
go away- she'll go at once."

At that instant Katerina Ivanovna's two aunts ran in at her cry,
and with them a maid-servant. All hurried to her.

"I will go away," said Grushenka, taking up her mantle from the
sofa. "Alyosha, darling, see me home!"

"Go away- go away, make haste!" cried Alyosha, clasping his
hands imploringly.

"Dear little Alyosha, see me home! I've got a pretty little
story to tell you on the way. I got up this scene for your benefit,
Alyosha. See me home, dear, you'll be glad of it afterwards."
