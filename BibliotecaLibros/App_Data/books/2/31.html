<br/>"By the way, I have a thing to ask, not a great one. Here are<br/>sixty copecks. Give them, dear Father, to someone poorer than me. I<br/>thought as I came along, better give through him. He'll know whom<br/>to give to."<br/><br/>"Thanks, my dear, thanks! You are a good woman. I love you. I<br/>will do so certainly. Is that your little girl?"<br/><br/>"My little girl, Father, Lizaveta."<br/><br/>"May the Lord bless you both, you and your babe Lizaveta! You<br/>have gladdened my heart, mother. Farewell, dear children, farewell,<br/>dear ones."<br/><br/>He blessed them all and bowed low to them.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
