<br/>"Yes, I shall be told, but he was carousing that night,<br/>squandering money; he was shown to have had fifteen hundred<br/>roubles- where did he get the money? But the very fact that only<br/>fifteen hundred could be found, and the other half of the sum could<br/>nowhere be discovered, shows that that money was not the same, and<br/>had never been in any envelope. By strict calculation of time it<br/>was proved at the preliminary inquiry that the prisoner ran<br/>straight from those women servants to Perhotin's without going<br/>home, and that he had been nowhere. So he had been all the time in<br/>company and therefore could not have divided the three thousand in<br/>half and hidden half in the town. It's just this consideration that<br/>has led the prosecutor to assume that the money is hidden in some<br/>crevice at Mokroe. Why not in the dungeons of the castle of<br/>Udolpho, gentlemen? Isn't this supposition really too fantastic and<br/>too romantic? And observe, if that supposition breaks down, the<br/>whole charge of robbery is scattered to the winds, for in that case<br/>what could have become of the other fifteen hundred roubles? By<br/>what miracle could they have disappeared, since it's proved the<br/>prisoner went nowhere else? And we are ready to ruin a man's life<br/>with such tales!<br/><br/>"I shall be told that he could not explain where he got the<br/>fifteen hundred that he had. and everyone knew that he was without<br/>money before that night. Who knew it, pray? The prisoner has made a<br/>clear and unflinching statement of the source of that money, and if<br/>you will have it so, gentlemen of the jury, nothing can be more<br/>probable than that statement, and more consistent with the temper<br/>and spirit of the prisoner. The prosecutor is charmed with his own<br/>romance. A man of weak will, who had brought himself to take the<br/>three thousand so insultingly offered by his betrothed, could not,<br/>we are told, have set aside half and sewn it up, but would, even if<br/>he had done so, have unpicked it every two days and taken out a<br/>hundred, and so would have spent it all in a month. All this, you<br/>will remember, was put forward in a tone what brooked no<br/>contradiction. But what if the thing happened quite differently?<br/>What if you've been weaving a romance, and about quite a different<br/>kind of man? That's just it, you have invented quite a different<br/>man!<br/><br/>"I shall be told, perhaps, there are witnesses that he spent on<br/>one day all that three thousand given him by his betrothed a month<br/>before the catastrophe, so he could not have divided the sum in<br/>half. But who are these witnesses? The value of their evidence has<br/>been shown in court already. Besides, in another man's hand a crust<br/>always seems larger, and no one of these witnesses counted that<br/>money; they all judged simply at sight. And the witness Maximov has<br/>testified that the prisoner had twenty thousand in his hand. You<br/>see, gentlemen of the jury, psychology is a two edged weapon. Let<br/>me turn the other edge now and see what comes of it.<br/><br/>"A month before the catastrophe the prisoner was entrusted by<br/>Katerina Ivanovna with three thousand roubles to send off by post.<br/>But the question is: is it true that they were entrusted to him in<br/>such an insulting and degrading way as was proclaimed just now? The<br/>first statement made by the young lady on the subject was<br/>different, perfectly different. In the second statement we heard<br/>only cries of resentment and revenge, cries of long-concealed<br/>hatred. And the very fact that the witness gave her first evidence<br/>incorrectly gives us a right to conclude that her second piece of<br/>evidence may have been incorrect also. The prosecutor will not,<br/>dare not (his own words) touch on that story. So be it. I will not<br/>touch on it either, but will only venture to observe that if a<br/>lofty and high-principled person, such as that highly respected<br/>young lady unquestionably is, if such a person, I say, allows<br/>herself suddenly in court to contradict her first statement, with<br/>the obvious motive of ruining the prisoner, it is clear that this<br/>evidence has been given not impartially, not coolly. Have not we<br/>the right to assume that a revengeful woman might have exaggerated<br/>much? Yes, she may well have exaggerated, in particular, the insult<br/>and humiliation of her offering him the money. No, it was offered<br/>in such a way that it was possible to take it, especially for a man<br/>so easygoing as the prisoner, above all, as he expected to receive<br/>shortly from his father the three thousand roubles that he reckoned<br/>was owing to him. It was unreflecting of him, but it was just his<br/>irresponsible want of reflection that made him so confident that<br/>his father would give him the money, that he would get it, and so<br/>could always dispatch the money entrusted to him and repay the<br/>debt.<br/><br/>"But the prosecutor refuses to allow that he could the same day<br/>have set aside half the money and sewn it up in a little bag.<br/>That's not his character, he tells us, he couldn't have had such<br/>feelings. But yet he talked himself of the broad Karamazov nature;<br/>he cried out about the two extremes which a Karamazov can<br/>contemplate at once. Karamazov is just such a two-sided nature,<br/>fluctuating between two extremes, that even when moved by the most<br/>violent craving for riotous gaiety, he can pull himself up, if<br/>something strikes him on the other side. And on the other side is<br/>love that new love which had flamed up in his heart, and for that<br/>love he needed money; oh, far more than for carousing with his<br/>mistress. If she were to say to him, 'I am yours, I won't have<br/>Fyodor Pavlovitch,' then he must have money to take her away. That<br/>was more important than carousing. Could a Karamazov fail to<br/>understand it? That anxiety was just what he was suffering from-<br/>what is there improbable in his laying aside that money and<br/>concealing it in case of emergency?<br/><br/>"But time passed, and Fyodor Pavlovitch did not give the<br/>prisoner the expected three thousand; on the contrary, the latter<br/>heard that he meant to use this sum to seduce the woman he, the<br/>prisoner, loved. 'If Fyodor Pavlovitch doesn't give the money,' he<br/>thought, 'I shall be put in the position of a thief before Katerina<br/>Ivanovna.' And then the idea presented itself to him that he would<br/>go to Katerina Ivanovna, lay before her the fifteen hundred roubles<br/>he still carried round his neck, and say, 'I am a scoundrel, but<br/>not a thief.' So here we have already a twofold reason why he<br/>should guard that sum of money as the apple of his eye, why he<br/>shouldn't unpick the little bag, and spend it a hundred at a time.<br/>Why should you deny the prisoner a sense of honour? Yes, he has a<br/>sense of honour, granted that it's misplaced, granted it's often<br/>mistaken, yet it exists and amounts to a passion, and he has proved<br/>that.<br/><br/>"But now the affair becomes even more complex; his jealous<br/>torments reach a climax, and those same two questions torture his<br/>fevered brain more and more: 'If I repay Katerina Ivanovna, where<br/>can I find the means to go off with Grushenka?' If he behaved<br/>wildly, drank, and made disturbances in the taverns in the course<br/>of that month, it was perhaps because he was wretched and strained<br/>beyond his powers of endurance. These two questions became so acute<br/>that they drove him at last to despair. He sent his younger brother<br/>to beg for the last time for the three thousand roubles, but<br/>without waiting for a reply, burst in himself and ended by beating<br/>the old man in the presence of witnesses. After that he had no<br/>prospect of getting it from anyone; his father would not give it<br/>him after that beating.<br/><br/>"The same evening he struck himself on the breast, just on the<br/>upper part of the breast where the little bag was, and swore to his<br/>brother that he had the means of not being a scoundrel, but that<br/>still he would remain a scoundrel, for he foresaw that he would not<br/>use that means, that he wouldn't have the character, that he<br/>wouldn't have the will-power to do it. Why, why does the prosecutor<br/>refuse to believe the evidence of Alexey Karamazov, given so<br/>genuinely and sincerely, so spontaneously and convincingly? And<br/>why, on the contrary, does he force me to believe in money hidden<br/>in a crevice, in the dungeons of the castle of Udolpho?<br/><br/>"The same evening, after his talk with his brother, the prisoner<br/>wrote that fatal letter, and that letter is the chief, the most<br/>stupendous proof of the prisoner having committed robbery! 'I shall<br/>beg from everyone, and if I don't get it I shall murder my father<br/>and shall take the envelope with the pink ribbon on it from under<br/>his mattress as soon as Ivan has gone.' A full programme of the<br/>murder, we are told, so it must have been he. 'It has all been done<br/>as he wrote,' cries the prosecutor.<br/><br/>"But in the first place, it's the letter of a drunken man and<br/>written in great irritation; secondly, he writes of the envelope<br/>from what he has heard from Smerdyakov again, for he has not seen<br/>the envelope himself; and thirdly, he wrote it indeed, but how can<br/>you prove that he did it? Did the prisoner take the envelope from<br/>under the pillow, did he find the money, did that money exist<br/>indeed? And was it to get money that the prisoner ran off, if you<br/>remember? He ran off post-haste not to steal, but to find out where<br/>she was, the woman who had crushed him. He was not running to carry<br/>out a programme, to carry out what he had written, that is, not for<br/>an act of premeditated robbery, but he ran suddenly, spontaneously,<br/>in a jealous fury. Yes! I shall be told, but when he got there and<br/>murdered him he seized the money, too. But did he murder him after<br/>all? The charge of robbery I repudiate with indignation. A man<br/>cannot be accused of robbery, if it's impossible to state<br/>accurately what he has stolen; that's an axiom. But did he murder<br/>him without robbery, did he murder him at all? Is that proved?<br/>Isn't that, too, a romance?"<br/><br/>
