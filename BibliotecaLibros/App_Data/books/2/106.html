<br/>"Yes, and you too perhaps quite misunderstand me, dear young<br/>lady. Maybe I'm not so good as I seem to you. I've a bad heart; I<br/>will have my own way. I fascinated poor Dmitri Fyodorovitch that<br/>day simply for fun."<br/><br/>"But now you'll save him. You've given me your word. You'll<br/>explain it all to him. You'll break to him that you have long loved<br/>another man, who is now offering you his hand."<br/><br/>"Oh, no I didn't give you my word to do that. It was you kept<br/>talking about that. I didn't give you my word."<br/><br/>"Then I didn't quite understand you," said Katerina Ivanovna<br/>slowly, turning a little pale. "You promised-"<br/><br/>"Oh no, angel lady, I've promised nothing," Grushenka<br/>interrupted softly and evenly, still with the same gay and simple<br/>expression. "You see at once, dear young lady, what a wilful wretch<br/>I am compared with you. If I want to do a thing I do it. I may have<br/>made you some promise just now. But now again I'm thinking: I may<br/>take Mitya again. I liked him very much once- liked him for almost<br/>a whole hour. Now maybe I shall go and tell him to stay with me<br/>from this day forward. You see, I'm so changeable."<br/><br/>"Just now you said- something quite different," Katerina<br/>Ivanovna whispered faintly.<br/><br/>"Ah, just now! But, you know, I'm such a soft-hearted, silly<br/>creature. Only think what he's gone through on my account! What if<br/>when I go home I feel sorry for him? What then?"<br/><br/>"I never expected-"<br/><br/>"Ah, young lady, how good and generous you are compared with me!<br/>Now perhaps you won't care for a silly creature like me, now you<br/>know my character. Give me your sweet little hand, angelic lady,"<br/>she said tenderly, and with a sort of reverence took Katerina<br/>Ivanovna's hand.<br/><br/>"Here, dear young lady, I'll take your hand and kiss it as you<br/>did mine. You kissed mine three times, but I ought to kiss yours<br/>three hundred times to be even with you. Well, but let that pass.<br/>And then it shall be as God wills. Perhaps I shall be your slave<br/>entirely and want to do your bidding like a slave. Let it be as God<br/>wills, without any agreements and promises. What a sweet hand- what<br/>a sweet hand you have! You sweet young lady, you incredible<br/>beauty!"<br/><br/>
