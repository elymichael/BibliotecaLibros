<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>6<br/>The First Interview with Smerdyakov<br/><br/><br/>THIS was the third time that Ivan had been to see Smerdyakov<br/>since his return from Moscow. The first time he had seen him and<br/>talked to him was on the first day of his arrival, then he had<br/>visited him once more, a fortnight later. But his visits had ended<br/>with that second one, so that it was now over a month since he had<br/>seen him. And he had scarcely heard anything of him.<br/><br/>Ivan had only returned five days after his father's death, so<br/>that he was not present at the funeral, which took place the day<br/>before he came back. The cause of his delay was that Alyosha, not<br/>knowing his Moscow address, had to apply to Katerina Ivanovna to<br/>telegraph to him, and she, not knowing his address either,<br/>telegraphed to her sister and aunt, reckoning on Ivan's going to<br/>see them as soon as he arrived in Moscow. But he did not go to them<br/>till four days after his arrival. When he got the telegram, he had,<br/>of course, set off post-haste to our town. The first to meet him<br/>was Alyosha, and Ivan was greatly surprised to find that, in<br/>opposition to the general opinion of the town, he refused to<br/>entertain a suspicion against Mitya, and spoke openly of Smerdyakov<br/>as the murderer. Later on, after seeing the police captain and the<br/>prosecutor, and hearing the details of the charge and the arrest,<br/>he was still more surprised at Alyosha, and ascribed his opinion<br/>only to his exaggerated brotherly feeling and sympathy with Mitya,<br/>of whom Alyosha, as Ivan knew, was very fond.<br/><br/>By the way, let us say a word or two of Ivan's feeling to his<br/>brother Dmitri. He positively disliked him; at most, felt sometimes<br/>a compassion for him, and even that was mixed with great contempt,<br/>almost repugnance. Mitya's whole personality, even his appearance,<br/>was extremely unattractive to him. Ivan looked with indignation on<br/>Katerina Ivanovna's love for his brother. Yet he went to see Mitya<br/>on the first day of his arrival, and that interview, far from<br/>shaking Ivan's belief in his guilt, positively strengthened it. He<br/>found his brother agitated, nervously excited. Mitya had been<br/>talkative, but very absent-minded and incoherent. He used violent<br/>language, accused Smerdyakov, and was fearfully muddled. He talked<br/>principally about the three thousand roubles, which he said had<br/>been "stolen" from him by his father.<br/><br/>"The money was mine, it was my money," Mitya kept repeating.<br/>"Even if I had stolen it, I should have had the right."<br/><br/>He hardly contested the evidence against him, and if he tried to<br/>turn a fact to his advantage, it was in an absurd and incoherent<br/>way. He hardly seemed to wish to defend himself to Ivan or anyone<br/>else. Quite the contrary, he was angry and proudly scornful of the<br/>charges against him; he was continually firing up and abusing<br/>everyone. He only laughed contemptuously at Grigory's evidence<br/>about the open door, and declared that it was "the devil that<br/>opened it." But he could not bring forward any coherent explanation<br/>of the fact. He even succeeded in insulting Ivan during their first<br/>interview, telling him sharply that it was not for people who<br/>declared that "everything was lawful," to suspect and question him.<br/>Altogether he was anything but friendly with Ivan on that occasion.<br/>Immediately after that interview with Mitya, Ivan went for the<br/>first time to see Smerdyakov.<br/><br/>In the railway train on his way from Moscow, he kept thinking of<br/>Smerdyakov and of his last conversation with him on the evening<br/>before he went away. Many things seemed to him puzzling and<br/>suspicious. when he gave his evidence to the investigating lawyer<br/>Ivan said nothing, for the time, of that conversation. He put that<br/>off till he had seen Smerdyakov, who was at that time in the<br/>hospital.<br/><br/>Doctor Herzenstube and Varvinsky, the doctor he met in the<br/>hospital, confidently asserted in reply to Ivan's persistent<br/>questions, that Smerdyakov's epileptic attack was unmistakably<br/>genuine, and were surprised indeed at Ivan asking whether he might<br/>not have been shamming on the day of the catastrophe. They gave him<br/>to understand that the attack was an exceptional one, the fits<br/>persisting and recurring several times, so that the patient's life<br/>was positively in danger, and it was only now, after they had<br/>applied remedies, that they could assert with confidence that the<br/>patient would survive. "Though it might well be," added Doctor<br/>Herzenstube, "that his reason would be impaired for a considerable<br/>period, if not permanently." On Ivan's asking impatiently whether<br/>that meant that he was now mad, they told him that this was not yet<br/>the case, in the full sense of the word, but that certain<br/>abnormalities were perceptible. Ivan decided to find out for<br/>himself what those abnormalities were.<br/>
