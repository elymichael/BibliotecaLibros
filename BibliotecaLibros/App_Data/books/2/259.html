When he was informed of the arrival of the "captain," he at once<br/>refused to see him. But Mitya persisted and sent his name up again.<br/>Samsonov questioned the lad minutely: What he looked like? Whether<br/>he was drunk? Was he going to make a row? The answer he received<br/>was: that he was sober, but wouldn't go away. The old man again<br/>refused to see him. Then Mitya, who had foreseen this, and<br/>purposely brought pencil and paper with him, wrote clearly on the<br/>piece of paper the words: "On most important business closely<br/>concerning Agrafena Alexandrovna," and sent it up to the old<br/>man.<br/><br/>After thinking a little Samsonov told the lad to take the<br/>visitor to the drawing-room, and sent the old woman downstairs with<br/>a summons to his younger son to come upstairs to him at once. This<br/>younger son, a man over six foot and of exceptional physical<br/>strength, who was closely-shaven and dressed in the European style,<br/>though his father still wore a kaftan and a beard, came at once<br/>without a comment. All the family trembled before the father. The<br/>old man had sent for this giant, not because he was afraid of the<br/>"captain" (he was by no means of a timorous temper), but in order<br/>to have a witness in case of any emergency. Supported by his son<br/>and the servant lad, he waddled at last into the drawing-room. It<br/>may be assumed that he felt considerable curiosity. The<br/>drawing-room in which Mitya was awaiting him was a vast, dreary<br/>room that laid a weight of depression on the heart. It had a double<br/>row of windows, a gallery, marbled walls, and three immense<br/>chandeliers with glass lustres covered with shades.<br/><br/>Mitya was sitting on a little chair at the entrance, awaiting<br/>his fate with nervous impatience. When the old man appeared at the<br/>opposite door, seventy feet away, Mitya jumped up at once, and with<br/>his long, military stride walked to meet him. Mitya was well<br/>dressed, in a frock-coat, buttoned up, with a round hat and black<br/>gloves in his hands, just as he had been three days before at the<br/>elder's, at the family meeting with his father and brothers. The<br/>old man waited for him, standing dignified and unbending, and Mitya<br/>felt at once that he had looked him through and through as he<br/>advanced. Mitya was greatly impressed, too, with Samsonov's<br/>immensely swollen face. His lower lip, which had always been thick,<br/>hung down now, looking like a bun. He bowed to his guest in<br/>dignified silence, motioned him to a low chair by the sofa, and,<br/>leaning on his son's arm he began lowering himself on to the sofa<br/>opposite, groaning painfully, so that Mitya, seeing his painful<br/>exertions, immediately felt remorseful and sensitively conscious of<br/>his insignificance in the presence of the dignified person he had<br/>ventured to disturb.<br/><br/>"What is it you want of me, sir?" said the old man,<br/>deliberately, distinctly, severely, but courteously, when he was at<br/>last seated.<br/><br/>Mitya started, leapt up, but sat down again. Then he began at<br/>once speaking with loud, nervous haste, gesticulating, and in a<br/>positive frenzy. He was unmistakably a man driven into a corner, on<br/>the brink of ruin, catching at the last straw, ready to sink if he<br/>failed. Old Samsonov probably grasped all this in an instant,<br/>though his face remained cold and immovable as a statue's.<br/><br/>"Most honoured sir, Kuzma Kuzmitch, you have no doubt heard more<br/>than once of my disputes with my father, Fyodor Pavlovitch<br/>Karamazov, who robbed me of my inheritance from my mother… seeing<br/>the whole town is gossiping about it… for here everyone's gossiping<br/>of what they shouldn't… and besides, it might have reached you<br/>through Grushenka… I beg your pardon, through Agrafena<br/>Alexandrovna… Agrafena Alexandrovna, the lady of whom I have the<br/>highest respect and esteem… "<br/><br/>So Mitya began, and broke down at the first sentence. We will<br/>not reproduce his speech word for word, but will only summarise the<br/>gist of it. Three months ago, he said, he had of express intention<br/>(Mitya purposely used these words instead of "intentionally")<br/>consulted a lawyer in the chief town of the province, "a<br/>distinguished lawyer, Kuzma Kuzmitch, Pavel Pavlovitch Korneplodov.<br/>You have perhaps heard of him? A man of vast intellect, the mind of<br/>a statesman… he knows you, too… spoke of you in the highest terms…<br/>" Mitya broke down again. But these breaks did not deter him. He<br/>leapt instantly over the gaps, and struggled on and on.<br/><br/>This Korneplodov, after questioning him minutely, and inspecting<br/>the documents he was able to bring him (Mitya alluded somewhat<br/>vaguely to these documents, and slurred over the subject with<br/>special haste), reported that they certainly might take proceedings<br/>concerning the village of Tchermashnya, which ought, he said, to<br/>have come to him, Mitya, from his mother, and so checkmate the old<br/>villain, his father… "because every door was not closed and justice<br/>might still find a loophole." In fact, he might reckon on an<br/>additional sum of six or even seven thousand roubles from Fyodor<br/>Pavlovitch, as Tchermashnya was worth, at least, twenty-five<br/>thousand, he might say twenty-eight thousand, in fact, "thirty,<br/>thirty, Kuzma Kuzmitch, and would you believe it, I didn't get<br/>seventeen from that heartless man!" So he, Mitya, had thrown the<br/>business up for the time, knowing nothing about the law, but on<br/>coming here was struck dumb by a cross- claim made upon him (here<br/>Mitya went adrift again and again took a flying leap forward), "so<br/>will not you, excellent and honoured Kuzma Kuzmitch, be willing to<br/>take up all my claims against that unnatural monster, and pay me a<br/>sum down of only three thousand?… You see, you cannot, in any case,<br/>lose over it. On my honour, my honour, I swear that. Quite the<br/>contrary, you may make six or seven thousand instead of three."<br/>Above all, he wanted this concluded that very day.<br/><br/>"I'll do the business with you at a notary's, or whatever it is…<br/>in fact, I'm ready to do anything… I'll hand over all the deeds…<br/>whatever you want, sign anything… and we could draw up the<br/>agreement at once… and if it were possible, if it were only<br/>possible, that very morning… . You could pay me that three<br/>thousand, for there isn't a capitalist in this town to compare with<br/>you, and so would save me from… save me, in fact… for a good, I<br/>might say an honourable action… . For I cherish the most honourable<br/>feelings for a certain person, whom you know well, and care for as<br/>a father. I would not have come, indeed, if it had not been as a<br/>father. And, indeed, it's a struggle of three in this business, for<br/>it's fate- that's a fearful thing, Kuzma Kuzmitch! A tragedy, Kuzma<br/>Kuzmitch, a tragedy! And as you've dropped out long ago, it's a<br/>tug-of-war between two. I'm expressing it awkwardly, perhaps, but<br/>I'm not a literary man. You see, I'm on the one side, and that<br/>monster on the other. So you must choose. It's either I or the<br/>monster. It all lies in your hands-.the fate of three lives, and<br/>the happiness of two… . Excuse me, I'm making a mess of it, but you<br/>understand… I see from your venerable eyes that you understand… and<br/>if you don't understand, I'm done for… so you see!"<br/><br/>Mitya broke off his clumsy speech with that, "so you see!" and<br/>jumping up from his seat, awaited the answer to his foolish<br/>proposal. At the last phrase he had suddenly become hopelessly<br/>aware that it had all fallen flat, above all, that he had been<br/>talking utter nonsense.<br/><br/>"How strange it is! On the way here it seemed all right, and now<br/>it's nothing but nonsense." The idea suddenly dawned on his<br/>despairing mind. All the while he had been talking, the old man sat<br/>motionless, watching him with an icy expression in his eyes. After<br/>keeping him for a moment in suspense, Kuzma Kuzmitch pronounced at<br/>last in the most positive and chilling tone:<br/>
