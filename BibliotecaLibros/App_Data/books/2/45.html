"You are blessed in believing that, or else most unhappy."<br/><br/>"Why unhappy?" Ivan asked smiling.<br/><br/>"Because, in all probability you don't believe yourself in the<br/>immortality of your soul, nor in what you have written yourself in<br/>your article on Church Jurisdiction."<br/><br/>"Perhaps you are right!… But I wasn't altogether joking," Ivan<br/>suddenly and strangely confessed, flushing quickly.<br/><br/>"You were not altogether joking. That's true. The question is<br/>still fretting your heart, and not answered. But the martyr likes<br/>sometimes to divert himself with his despair, as it were driven to<br/>it by despair itself. Meanwhile, in your despair, you, too, divert<br/>yourself with magazine articles, and discussions in society, though<br/>you don't believe your own arguments, and with an aching heart mock<br/>at them inwardly… . That question you have not answered, and it is<br/>your great grief, for it clamours for an answer."<br/><br/>"But can it be answered by me? Answered in the affirmative?"<br/>Ivan went on asking strangely, still looking at the elder with the<br/>same inexplicable smile.<br/><br/>"If it can't be decided in the affirmative, it will never be<br/>decided in the negative. You know that that is the peculiarity of<br/>your heart, and all its suffering is due to it. But thank the<br/>Creator who has given you a lofty heart capable of such suffering;<br/>of thinking and seeking higher things, for our dwelling is in the<br/>heavens. God grant that your heart will attain the answer on earth,<br/>and may God bless your path."<br/><br/>The elder raised his hand and would have made the sign of the<br/>cross over Ivan from where he stood. But the latter rose from his<br/>seat, went up to him, received his blessing, and kissing his hand<br/>went back to his place in silence. His face looked firm and<br/>earnest. This action and all the preceding conversation, which was<br/>so surprising from Ivan, impressed everyone by its strangeness and<br/>a certain solemnity, so that all were silent for a moment, and<br/>there was a look almost of apprehension in Alyosha's face. But<br/>Miusov suddenly shrugged his shoulders. And at the same moment<br/>Fyodor Pavlovitch jumped up from his seat.<br/><br/>"Most pious and holy elder," he cried pointing to Ivan, "that is<br/>my son, flesh of my flesh, the dearest of my flesh! He is my most<br/>dutiful Karl Moor, so to speak, while this son who has just come<br/>in, Dmitri, against whom I am seeking justice from you, is the<br/>undutiful Franz Moor- they are both out of Schiller's Robbers, and<br/>so I am the reigning Count von Moor! Judge and save us! We need not<br/>only your prayers but your prophecies!"<br/><br/>"Speak without buffoonery, and don't begin by insulting the<br/>members of your family," answered the elder, in a faint, exhausted<br/>voice. He was obviously getting more and more fatigued, and his<br/>strength was failing.<br/><br/>"An unseemly farce which I foresaw when I came here!" cried<br/>Dmitri indignantly. He too leapt up. "Forgive it, reverend Father,"<br/>he added, addressing the elder. "I am not a cultivated man, and I<br/>don't even know how to address you properly, but you have been<br/>deceived and you have been too good-natured in letting us meet<br/>here. All my father wants is a scandal. Why he wants it only he can<br/>tell. He always has some motive. But I believe I know why- "<br/>
