"What have I to be afraid of? Let them write down the whole
truth," Smerdyakov pronounced firmly.

"And have you told them every word of our conversation at the
gate?"

"No, not to say every word."

"And did you tell them that you can sham fits, as you boasted
then?"

"No, I didn't tell them that either."

"Tell me now, why did you send me then to Tchermashnya?"

"I was afraid you'd go away to Moscow; Tchermashnya is nearer,
anyway."

"You are lying; you suggested my going away yourself; you told
me to get out of the way of trouble."

"That was simply out of affection and my sincere devotion to
you, foreseeing trouble in the house, to spare you. Only I wanted
to spare myself even more. That's why I told you to get out of
harm's way, that you might understand that there would be trouble
in the house, and would remain at home to protect your father."

"You might have said it more directly, you blockhead!" Ivan
suddenly fired up.
