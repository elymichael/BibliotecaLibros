<br/>Bearing the Cross, in slavish dress,<br/><br/>Weary and worn, the Heavenly King<br/><br/>Our mother, Russia, came to bless,<br/><br/>And through our land went wandering. And that certainly was so,<br/>I assure you.<br/><br/>/<br/><br/>"And behold, He deigned to appear for a moment to the people, to<br/>the tortured, suffering people, sunk in iniquity, but loving Him<br/>like children. My story is laid in Spain, in Seville, in the most<br/>terrible time of the Inquisition, when fires were lighted every day<br/>to the glory of God, and 'in the splendid auto da fe the wicked<br/>heretics were burnt.' Oh, of course, this was not the coming in<br/>which He will appear, according to His promise, at the end of time<br/>in all His heavenly glory, and which will be sudden 'as lightning<br/>flashing from east to west.' No, He visited His children only for a<br/>moment, and there where the flames were crackling round the<br/>heretics. In His infinite mercy He came once more among men in that<br/>human shape in which He walked among men for thirty-three years<br/>fifteen centuries ago. He came down to the 'hot pavements' of the<br/>southern town in which on the day before almost a hundred heretics<br/>had, ad majorem gloriam Dei, been burnt by the cardinal, the Grand<br/>Inquisitor, in a magnificent auto da fe, in the presence of the<br/>king, the court, the knights, the cardinals, the most charming<br/>ladies of the court, and the whole population of Seville.<br/><br/>"He came softly, unobserved, and yet, strange to say, everyone<br/>recognised Him. That might be one of the best passages in the poem.<br/>I mean, why they recognised Him. The people are irresistibly drawn<br/>to Him, they surround Him, they flock about Him, follow Him. He<br/>moves silently in their midst with a gentle smile of infinite<br/>compassion. The sun of love burns in His heart, and power shine<br/>from His eyes, and their radiance, shed on the people, stirs their<br/>hearts with responsive love. He holds out His hands to them,<br/>blesses them, and a healing virtue comes from contact with Him,<br/>even with His garments. An old man in the crowd, blind from<br/>childhood, cries out, 'O Lord, heal me and I shall see Thee!' and,<br/>as it were, scales fall from his eyes and the blind man sees Him.<br/>The crowd weeps and kisses the earth under His feet. Children throw<br/>flowers before Him, sing, and cry hosannah. 'It is He- it is He!'<br/>repeat. 'It must be He, it can be no one but Him!' He stops at the<br/>steps of the Seville cathedral at the moment when the weeping<br/>mourners are bringing in a little open white coffin. In it lies a<br/>child of seven, the only daughter of a prominent citizen. The dead<br/>child lies hidden in flowers. 'He will raise your child,' the crowd<br/>shouts to the weeping mother. The priest, coming to meet the<br/>coffin, looks perplexed, and frowns, but the mother of the dead<br/>child throws herself at His feet with a wail. 'If it is Thou, raise<br/>my child!' she cries, holding out her hands to Him. The procession<br/>halts, the coffin is laid on the steps at His feet. He looks with<br/>compassion, and His lips once more softly pronounce, 'Maiden,<br/>arise!' and the maiden arises. The little girl sits up in the<br/>coffin and looks round, smiling with wide-open wondering eyes,<br/>holding a bunch of white roses they had put in her hand.<br/><br/>"There are cries, sobs, confusion among the people, and at that<br/>moment the cardinal himself, the Grand Inquisitor, passes by the<br/>cathedral. He is an old man, almost ninety, tall and erect, with a<br/>withered face and sunken eyes, in which there is still a gleam of<br/>light. He is not dressed in his gorgeous cardinal's robes, as he<br/>was the day before, when he was burning the enemies of the Roman<br/>Church- at this moment he is wearing his coarse, old, monk's<br/>cassock. At a distance behind him come his gloomy assistants and<br/>slaves and the 'holy guard.' He stops at the sight of the crowd and<br/>watches it from a distance. He sees everything; he sees them set<br/>the coffin down at His feet, sees the child rise up, and his face<br/>darkens. He knits his thick grey brows and his eyes gleam with a<br/>sinister fire. He holds out his finger and bids the guards take<br/>Him. And such is his power, so completely are the people cowed into<br/>submission and trembling obedience to him, that the crowd<br/>immediately makes way for the guards, and in the midst of deathlike<br/>silence they lay hands on Him and lead him away. The crowd<br/>instantly bows down to the earth, like one man, before the old<br/>Inquisitor. He blesses the people in silence and passes on' The<br/>guards lead their prisoner to the close, gloomy vaulted prison- in<br/>the ancient palace of the Holy, inquisition and shut him in it. The<br/>day passes and is followed by the dark, burning, 'breathless' night<br/>of Seville. The air is 'fragrant with laurel and lemon.' In the<br/>pitch darkness the iron door of the prison is suddenly opened and<br/>the Grand Inquisitor himself comes in with a light in his hand. He<br/>is alone; the door is closed at once behind him. He stands in the<br/>doorway and for a minute or two gazes into His face. At last he<br/>goes up slowly, sets the light on the table and speaks.<br/><br/>"'Is it Thou? Thou?' but receiving no answer, he adds at once.<br/>'Don't answer, be silent. What canst Thou say, indeed? I know too<br/>well what Thou wouldst say. And Thou hast no right to add anything<br/>to what Thou hadst said of old. Why, then, art Thou come to hinder<br/>us? For Thou hast come to hinder us, and Thou knowest that. But<br/>dost thou know what will be to-morrow? I know not who Thou art and<br/>care not to know whether it is Thou or only a semblance of Him, but<br/>to-morrow I shall condemn Thee and burn Thee at the stake as the<br/>worst of heretics. And the very people who have to-day kissed Thy<br/>feet, to-morrow at the faintest sign from me will rush to heap up<br/>the embers of Thy fire. Knowest Thou that? Yes, maybe Thou knowest<br/>it,' he added with thoughtful penetration, never for a moment<br/>taking his eyes off the Prisoner."<br/><br/>"I don't quite understand, Ivan. What does it mean?" Alyosha,<br/>who had been listening in silence, said with a smile. "Is it simply<br/>a wild fantasy, or a mistake on the part of the old man- some<br/>impossible quid pro quo?"<br/><br/>
