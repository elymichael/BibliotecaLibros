It was diffcult to imagine what Kalgonov was excited about, but
his excitement was genuine. Mitya followed his lead without
protest.

"Well, but if they did thrash him!" he cried, laughing.

"It's not that they thrashed me exactly, but what I mean is- "
put in Maximov.

"What do you mean? Either they thrashed you or they didn't."

"What o'clock is it, panie?" the Pole, with the pipe, asked his
tall friend, with a bored expression. The other shrugged his
shoulders in reply. Neither of them had a watch.

"Why not talk? Let other people talk. Mustn't other people talk
because you're bored?" Grushenka flew at him with evident intention
of finding fault. Something seemed for the first time to flash upon
Mitya's mind. This time the Pole answered with unmistakable
irritability.

"Pani, I didn't oppose it. I didn't say anything."

"All right then. Come, tell us your story," Grushenka cried to
Maximov. "Why are you all silent?"

"There's nothing to tell, it's all so foolish," answered Maximov
at once, with evident satisfaction, mincing a little. "Besides, all
that's by way of allegory in Gogol, for he's made all the names
have a meaning. Nozdryov was really called Nosov, and Kuvshinikov
had quite a different name, he was called Shkvornev. Fenardi really
was called Fenardi, only he wasn't an Italian but a Russian, and
Mamsel Fenardi was a pretty girl with her pretty little legs in
tights, and she had a little short skirt with spangles, and she
kept turning round and round, only not for four hours but for four
minutes only, and she bewitched everyoneâ€¦ "

"But what were you beaten for?" cried Kalganov.

"For Piron!" answered Maximov.
