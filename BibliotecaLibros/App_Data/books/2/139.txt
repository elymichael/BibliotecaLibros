"Never mind my being witty, but I must say you show nice feeling
for Alexey Fyodorovitch's sufferings! Oh, my dear Alexey
Fyodorovitch, what's killing me is no one thing in particular, not
Herzenstube, but everything together, that's what is too much for
me."

"That's enough, mamma, enough about Herzenstube," Lise laughed
gaily. "Make haste with the lint and the lotion, mamma. That's
simply Goulard's water, Alexey Fyodorovitch, I remember the name
now, but it's a splendid lotion. Would you believe it, Mamma, on
the way here he had a fight with the boys in the street, and it was
a boy bit his finger, isn't he a child, a child himself? Is he fit
to be married after that? For only fancy, he wants to be married,
mamma. Just think of him married, wouldn't it be funny, wouldn't it
be awful?"

And Lise kept laughing her thin hysterical giggle, looking slyly
at Alyosha.

"But why married, Lise? What makes you talk of such a thing?
It's quite out of place and perhaps the boy was rabid."

"Why, mamma! As though there were rabid boys!"

"Why not, Lise, as though I had said something stupid! Your boy
might have been bitten by a mad dog and he would become mad and
bite anyone near him. How well she has bandaged it, Alexey
Fyodorovitch! I couldn't have done it. Do you still feel the
pain?"

"It's nothing much now."

"You don't feel afraid of water?" asked Lise.

"Come, that's enough, Lise, perhaps I really was rather too
quick talking of the boy being rabid, and you pounced upon it at
once. Katerina Ivanovna has only just heard that you are here,
Alexey Fyodorovitch, she simply rushed at me, she's dying to see
you, dying!"

"Ach, mamma, go to them yourself. He can't go just now, he is in
too much pain."
