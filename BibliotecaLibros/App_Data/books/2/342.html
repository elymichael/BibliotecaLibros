<br/>"Ask at the top of the stairs. If the lady wants to receive you,<br/>she'll receive you. If she won't, she won't."<br/><br/>Pyotr Ilyitch went up, but did not find things so easy here. The<br/>footman was unwilling to take in his name, but finally called a<br/>maid. Pyotr Ilyitch politely but insistently begged her to inform<br/>her lady that an official, living in the town, called Perhotin, had<br/>called on particular business, and that if it were not of the<br/>greatest importance he would not have ventured to come. "Tell her<br/>in those words, in those words exactly," he asked the girl.<br/><br/>She went away. He remained waiting in the entry. Madame Hohlakov<br/>herself was already in her bedroom, though not yet asleep. She had<br/>felt upset ever since Mitya's visit, and had a presentiment that<br/>she would not get through the night without the sick headache which<br/>always, with her, followed such excitement. She was surprised on<br/>hearing the announcement from the maid. She irritably declined to<br/>see him, however, though the unexpected visit at such an hour, of<br/>an "official living in the town," who was a total stranger, roused<br/>her feminine curiosity intensely. But this time Pyotr Ilyitch was<br/>as obstinate as a mule. He begged the maid most earnestly to take<br/>another message in these very words:<br/><br/>"That he had come on business of the greatest importance, and<br/>that Madame Hohlakov might have cause to regret it later, if she<br/>refused to see him now."<br/><br/>"I plunged headlong," he described it afterwards.<br/><br/>The maid, gazing at him in amazement, went to take his message<br/>again. Madame Hohlakov was impressed. She thought a little, asked<br/>what he looked like, and learned that he was very well dressed,<br/>young, and so polite." We may note, parenthetically, that Pyotr<br/>Ilyitch was a rather good-looking young man, and well aware of the<br/>fact. Madame Hohlakov made up her mind to see him. She was in her<br/>dressing-gown and slippers, but she flung a black shawl over her<br/>shoulders. "The official" was asked to walk into the drawing-room,<br/>the very room in which Mitya had been received shortly before. The<br/>lady came to meet her visitor, with a sternly inquiring<br/>countenance, and, without asking him to sit down, began at once<br/>with the question:<br/><br/>"What do you want?"<br/><br/>"I have ventured to disturb you, madam, on a matter concerning<br/>our common acquaintance, Dmitri Fyodorovitch Karamazov," Perhotin<br/>began.<br/><br/>But he had hardly uttered the name, when the lady's face showed<br/>signs of acute irritation. She almost shrieked, and interrupted him<br/>in a fury:<br/><br/>"How much longer am I to be worried by that awful man?" she<br/>cried hysterically. "How dare you, sir, how could you venture to<br/>disturb a lady who is a stranger to you, in her own house at such<br/>an hour!… And to force yourself upon her to talk of a man who came<br/>here, to this very drawing-room, only three hours ago, to murder<br/>me, and went stamping out of the room, as no one would go out of a<br/>decent house. Let me tell you, sir, that I shall lodge a complaint<br/>against you, that I will not let it pass. Kindly leave me at once…<br/>I am a mother… . I… I-"<br/><br/>
