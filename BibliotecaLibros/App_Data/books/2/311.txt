"Aie! How tight you squeeze! You've quite broken my fingers,"
laughed Kalganov.

"He always squeezes like that, always," Grushenka put in gaily,
with a timid smile, seeming suddenly convinced from Mitya's face
that he was not going to make a scene. She was watching him with
intense curiosity and still some uneasiness. She was impressed by
something about him, and indeed the last thing she expected of him
was that he would come in and speak like this at such a moment.

"Good evening," Maximov ventured blandly on the left. Mitya
rushed up to him, too.

"Good evening. You're here, too! How glad I am to find you here,
too! Gentlemen, gentlemen, I- " (He addressed the Polish gentleman
with the pipe again, evidently taking him for the most important
person present.) "I flew here… . I wanted to spend my last day, my
last hour in this room, in this very room&#160;… where I, too,
adored… my queen… . Forgive me, Panie," he cried wildly, "I flew
here and vowed- Oh, don't be afraid, it's my last night! Let's
drink to our good understanding. They'll bring the wine at once… .
I brought this with me." (Something made him pull out his bundle of
notes.) "Allow me, panie! I want to have music, singing, a revel,
as we had before. But the worm, the unnecessary worm, will crawl
away, and there'll be no more of him. I will commemorate my day of
joy on my last night."

He was almost choking. There was so much, so much he wanted to
say, but strange exclamations were all that came from his lips. The
Pole gazed fixedly at him, at the bundle of notes in his hand;
looked at Grushenka, and was in evident perplexity.

"If my suverin lady is permitting- " he was beginning.

"What does 'suverin' mean? 'Sovereign,' I suppose?" interrupted
Grushenka. "I can't help laughing at you, the way you talk. Sit
down, Mitya, what are you talking about? Don't frighten us, please.
You won't frighten us, will you? If you won't, I am glad to see
you… "

"Me, me frighten you?" cried Mitya, flinging up his hands. "Oh,
pass me by, go your way, I won't hinder you!… "

And suddenly he surprised them all, and no doubt himself as
well, by flinging himself on a chair, and bursting into tears,
turning his head away to the opposite wall, while his arms clasped
the back of the chair tight, as though embracing it.

"Come, come, what a fellow you are!" cried Grushenka
reproachfully. "That's just how he comes to see me- he begins
talking, and I can't make out what he means. He cried like that
once before, and now he's crying again! It's shamefull Why are you
crying? As though you had anything to cry for!" she added
enigmatically, emphasising each word with some irritability.
