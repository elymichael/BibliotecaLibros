<br/>"A wash-stand? That's all right… but where am I to put<br/>this?"<br/><br/>With the strangest perplexity he indicated his bundle of<br/>hundred-rouble notes, looking inquiringly at Pyotr Ilyitch as<br/>though it were for him to decide what he, Mitya, was to do with his<br/>own money.<br/><br/>"In your pocket, or on the table here. They won't be lost."<br/><br/>"In my pocket? Yes, in my pocket. All right… . But, I say,<br/>that's all nonsense," he cried, as though suddenly coming out of<br/>his absorption. "Look here, let's first settle that business of the<br/>pistols. Give them back to me. Here's your money… because I am in<br/>great need of them… and I haven't a minute, a minute to spare."<br/><br/>And taking the topmost note from the bundle he held it out to<br/>Pyotr Ilyitch.<br/><br/>"But I shan't have change enough. Haven't you less?"<br/><br/>"No," said Mitya, looking again at the bundle, and as though not<br/>trusting his own words he turned over two or three of the topmost<br/>ones.<br/><br/>"No, they're all alike," he added, and again he looked<br/>inquiringly at Pyotr Ilyitch.<br/><br/>"How have you grown so rich?" the latter asked. "Wait, I'll send<br/>my boy to Plotnikov's, they close late- to see if they won't change<br/>it. Here, Misha!" he called into the passage.<br/><br/>"To Plotnikov's shop- first-rate!" cried Mitya, as though struck<br/>by an idea. "Misha," he turned to the boy as he came in, "look<br/>here, run to Plotnikov's and tell them that Dmitri Fyodorovitch<br/>sends his greetings, and will be there directly… . But listen,<br/>listen, tell them to have champagne, three dozen bottles, ready<br/>before I come, and packed as it was to take to Mokroe. I took four<br/>dozen with me then," he added (suddenly addressing Pyotr Ilyitch);<br/>"they know all about it, don't you trouble, Misha," he turned again<br/>to the boy. "Stay, listen; tell them to put in cheese, Strasburg<br/>pies, smoked fish, ham, caviare, and everything, everything they've<br/>got, up to a hundred roubles, or a hundred and twenty as before… .<br/>But wait: don't let them forget dessert, sweets, pears,<br/>watermelons, two or three or four- no, one melon's enough, and<br/>chocolate, candy, toffee, fondants; in fact, everything I took to<br/>Mokroe before, three hundred roubles' worth with the champagne… let<br/>it be just the same again. And remember, Misha, if you are called<br/>Misha- His name is Misha, isn't it?" He turned to Pyotr Ilyitch<br/>again.<br/><br/>
