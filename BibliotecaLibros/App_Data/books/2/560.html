<br/>"You see, gentlemen of the jury, on the night of the murder,<br/>there were five persons in Fyodor Pavlovitch's- Fyodor Pavlovitch<br/>himself (but he did not kill himself, that's evident); then his<br/>servant, Grigory, but he was almost killed himself; the third<br/>person was Grigory's wife, Marfa Ignatyevna, but it would be simply<br/>shameful to imagine her murdering her master. Two persons are left-<br/>the prisoner and Smerdyakov. But, if we are to believe the<br/>prisoner's statement that he is not the murderer, then Smerdyakov<br/>must have been, for there is no other alternative, no one else can<br/>be found. That is what accounts for the artful, astounding<br/>accusation against the unhappy idiot who committed suicide<br/>yesterday. Had a shadow of suspicion rested on anyone else, had<br/>there been any sixth person, I am persuaded that even the prisoner<br/>would have been ashamed to accuse Smerdyakov, and would have<br/>accused that sixth person, for to charge Smerdyakov with that<br/>murder is perfectly absurd.<br/><br/>"Gentlemen, let us lay aside psychology, let us lay aside<br/>medicine, let us even lay aside logic, let us turn only to the<br/>facts and see what the facts tell us. If Smerdyakov killed him, how<br/>did he do it? Alone or with the assistance of the prisoner? Let us<br/>consider the first alternative- that he did it alone. If he had<br/>killed him it must have been with some object, for some advantage<br/>to himself. But not having a shadow of the motive that the prisoner<br/>had for the murder- hatred, jealousy, and so on- Smerdyakov could<br/>only have murdered him for the sake of gain, in order to<br/>appropriate the three thousand roubles he had seen his master put<br/>in the envelope. And yet he tells another person- and a person most<br/>closely interested, that is, the prisoner- everything about the<br/>money and the signals, where the envelope lay, what was written on<br/>it, what it was tied up with, and, above all, told him of those<br/>signals by which he could enter the house. Did he do this simply to<br/>betray himself, or to invite to the same enterprise one who would<br/>be anxious to get that envelope for himself? 'Yes,' I shall be<br/>told, 'but he betrayed it from fear.' But how do you explain this?<br/>A man who could conceive such an audacious, savage act, and carry<br/>it out, tells facts which are known to no one else in the world,<br/>and which, if he held his tongue, no one would ever have<br/>guessed!<br/><br/>"No, however cowardly he might be, if he had plotted such a<br/>crime, nothing would have induced him to tell anyone about the<br/>envelope and the signals, for that was as good as betraying himself<br/>beforehand. He would have invented something, he would have told<br/>some lie if he had been forced to give information, but he would<br/>have been silent about that. For, on the other hand, if he had said<br/>nothing about the money, but had committed the murder and stolen<br/>the money, no one in the world could have charged him with murder<br/>for the sake of robbery, since no one but he had seen the money, no<br/>one but he knew of its existence in the house. Even if he had been<br/>accused of the murder, it could only have been thought that he had<br/>committed it from some other motive. But since no one had observed<br/>any such motive in him beforehand, and everyone saw, on the<br/>contrary, that his master was fond of him and honoured him with his<br/>confidence, he would, of course, have been the last to be<br/>suspected. People would have suspected first the man who had a<br/>motive, a man who had himself declared he had such motives, who had<br/>made no secret of it; they would, in fact, have suspected the son<br/>of the murdered man, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. Had Smerdyakov killed and<br/>robbed him, and the son been accused of it, that would, of course,<br/>have suited Smerdyakov. Yet are we to believe that, though plotting<br/>the murder, he told that son, Dmitri, about the money, the<br/>envelope, and the signals? Is that logical? Is that clear?<br/><br/>"When the day of the murder planned by Smerdyakov came, we have<br/>him falling downstairs in a feigned fit- with what object? In the<br/>first place that Grigory, who had been intending to take his<br/>medicine, might put it off and remain on guard, seeing there was no<br/>one to look after the house, and, in the second place, I suppose,<br/>that his master seeing that there was no one to guard him, and in<br/>terror of a visit from his son, might redouble his vigilance and<br/>precaution. And, most of all, I suppose that he, Smerdyakov,<br/>disabled by the fit, might be carried from the kitchen, where he<br/>always slept, apart from all the rest, and where he could go in and<br/>out as he liked, to Grigory's room at the other end of the lodge,<br/>where he was always put, shut off by a screen three paces from<br/>their own bed. This was the immemorial custom established by his<br/>master and the kindhearted Marfa Ignatyevna, whenever he had a fit.<br/>There, lying behind the screen, he would most likely, to keep up<br/>the sham, have begun groaning, and so keeping them awake all night<br/>(as Grigory and his wife testified). And all this, we are to<br/>believe, that he might more conveniently get up and murder his<br/>master!<br/><br/>"But I shall be told that he shammed illness on purpose that he<br/>might not be suspected and that he told the prisoner of the money<br/>and the signals to tempt him to commit the murder, and when he had<br/>murdered him and had gone away with the money, making a noise, most<br/>likely, and waking people, Smerdyakov got up, am I to believe, and<br/>went in- what for? To murder his master a second time and carry off<br/>the money that had already been stolen? Gentlemen, are you<br/>laughing? I am ashamed to put forward such suggestions, but,<br/>incredible as it seems, that's just what the prisoner alleges. When<br/>he had left the house, had knocked Grigory down and raised an<br/>alarm, he tells us Smerdyakov got up, went in and murdered his<br/>master and stole the money! I won't press the point that Smerdyakov<br/>could hardly have reckoned on this beforehand, and have foreseen<br/>that the furious and exasperated son would simply come to peep in<br/>respectfully, though he knew the signals, and beat a retreat,<br/>leaving Smerdyakov his booty. Gentlemen of the jury, I put this<br/>question to you in earnest: when was the moment when Smerdyakov<br/>could have committed his crime? Name that moment, or you can't<br/>accuse him.<br/><br/>"But, perhaps, the fit was a real one, the sick man suddenly<br/>recovered, heard a shout, and went out. Well- what then? He looked<br/>about him and said, 'Why not go and kill the master?' And how did<br/>he know what had happened, since he had been lying unconscious till<br/>that moment? But there's a limit to these flights of fancy.<br/><br/>"'Quite so,' some astute people will tell me, 'but what if they<br/>were in agreement? What if they murdered him together and shared<br/>the money- what then?' A weighty question, truly! And the facts to<br/>confirm it are astounding. One commits the murder and takes all the<br/>trouble while his accomplice lies on one side shamming a fit,<br/>apparently to arouse suspicion in everyone, alarm in his master and<br/>alarm in Grigory. It would be interesting to know what motives<br/>could have induced the two accomplices to form such an insane<br/>plan.<br/><br/>"But perhaps it was not a case of active complicity on<br/>Smerdyakov's part, but only of passive acquiescence; perhaps<br/>Smerdyakov was intimidated and agreed not to prevent the murder,<br/>and foreseeing that he would be blamed for letting his master be<br/>murdered, without screaming for help or resisting, he may have<br/>obtained permission from Dmitri Karamazov to get out of the way by<br/>shamming a fit- 'you may murder him as you like; it's nothing to<br/>me.' But as this attack of Smerdyakov's was bound to throw the<br/>household into confusion, Dmitri Karamazov could never have agreed<br/>to such a plan. I will waive that point however. Supposing that he<br/>did agree, it would still follow that Dmitri Karamazov is the<br/>murderer and the instigator, and Smerdyakov is only a passive<br/>accomplice, and not even an accomplice, but merely acquiesced<br/>against his will through terror.<br/><br/>"But what do we see? As soon as he is arrested the prisoner<br/>instantly throws all the blame on Smerdyakov, not accusing him of<br/>being his accomplice, but of being himself the murderer. 'He did it<br/>alone,' he says. 'He murdered and robbed him. It was the work of<br/>his hands.' Strange sort of accomplices who begin to accuse one<br/>another at once! And think of the risk for Karamazov. After<br/>committing the murder while his accomplice lay in bed, he throws<br/>the blame on the invalid, who might well have resented it and in<br/>self-preservation might well have confessed the truth. For he might<br/>well have seen that the court would at once judge how far he was<br/>responsible, and so he might well have reckoned that if he were<br/>punished, it would be far less severely than the real murderer. But<br/>in that case he would have been certain to make a confession, yet<br/>he has not done so. Smerdyakov never hinted at their complicity,<br/>though the actual murderer persisted in accusing him and declaring<br/>that he had committed the crime alone.<br/><br/>"What's more, Smerdyakov at the inquiry volunteered the<br/>statement that it was he who had told the prisoner of the envelope<br/>of notes and of the signals, and that, but for him, he would have<br/>known nothing about them. If he had really been a guilty<br/>accomplice, would he so readily have made this statement at the<br/>inquiry? On the contrary, he would have tried to conceal it, to<br/>distort the facts or minimise them. But he was far from distorting<br/>or minimising them. No one but an innocent man, who had no fear of<br/>being charged with complicity, could have acted as he did. And in a<br/>fit of melancholy arising from his disease and this catastrophe he<br/>hanged himself yesterday. He left a note written in his peculiar<br/>language, 'I destroy myself of my own will and inclination so as to<br/>throw no blame on anyone.' What would it have cost him to add: 'I<br/>am the murderer, not Karamazov'? But that he did not add. Did his<br/>conscience lead him to suicide and not to avowing his guilt?<br/><br/>
