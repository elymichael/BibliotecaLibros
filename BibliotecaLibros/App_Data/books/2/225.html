<br/>The news of his death spread at once through the hermitage and<br/>reached the monastery. The nearest friends of the deceased and<br/>those whose duty it was from their position began to lay out the<br/>corpse according to the ancient ritual, and all the monks gathered<br/>together in the church. And before dawn the news of the death<br/>reached the town. By the morning all the town was talking of the<br/>event, and crowds were flocking from the town to the monastery. But<br/>this subject will be treated in the next book; I will only add here<br/>that before a day had passed something happened so unexpected, so<br/>strange, upsetting, and bewildering in its effect on the monks and<br/>the townspeople, that after all these years, that day of general<br/>suspense is still vividly remembered in the town.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
