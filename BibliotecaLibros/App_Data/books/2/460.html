"My wife was dreadfully jealous over me, too," Maximov put in<br/>his word.<br/><br/>"Jealous of you?" Grushenka laughed in spite of herself. "Of<br/>whom could she have been jealous?"<br/><br/>"Of the servant girls."<br/><br/>"Hold your tongue, Maximushka, I am in no laughing mood now; I<br/>feel angry. Don't ogle the pies. I shan't give you any; they are<br/>not good for you, and I won't give you any vodka either. I have to<br/>look after him, too, just as though I kept an almshouse," she<br/>laughed.<br/><br/>"I don't deserve your kindness. I am a worthless creature," said<br/>Maximov, with tears in his voice. "You would do better to spend<br/>your kindness on people of more use than me."<br/><br/>"Ech, everyone is of use, Maximushka, and how can we tell who's<br/>of most use? If only that Pole didn't exist, Alyosha. He's taken it<br/>into his head to fall ill, too, to-day. I've been to see him also.<br/>And I shall send him some pies, too, on purpose. I hadn't sent him<br/>any, but Mitya accused me of it, so now I shall send some! Ah,<br/>here's Fenya with a letter! Yes, it's from the Poles- begging<br/>again!<br/><br/>Pan Mussyalovitch had indeed sent an extremely long and<br/>characteristically eloquent letter in which he begged her to lend<br/>him three roubles. In the letter was enclosed a receipt for the<br/>sum, with a promise to repay it within three months, signed by Pan<br/>Vrublevsky as well. Grushenka had received many such letters,<br/>accompanied by such receipts, from her former lover during the<br/>fortnight of her convalescence. But she knew that the two Poles had<br/>been to ask after her health during her illness. The first letter<br/>Grushenka got from them was a long one, written on large notepaper<br/>and with a big family crest on the seal. It was so obscure and<br/>rhetorical that Grushenka put it down before she had read half,<br/>unable to make head or tail of it. She could not attend to letters<br/>then. The first letter was followed next day by another in which<br/>Pan Mussyalovitch begged her for a loan of two thousand roubles for<br/>a very short period. Grushenka left that letter, too, unanswered. A<br/>whole series of letters had followed- one every day- all as pompous<br/>and rhetorical, but the loan asked for, gradually diminishing,<br/>dropped to a hundred roubles, than to twenty-five, to ten, and<br/>finally Grushenka received a letter in which both the Poles begged<br/>her for only one rouble and included a receipt signed by both.<br/><br/>Then Grushenka suddenly felt sorry for them, and at dusk she<br/>went round herself to their lodging. She found the two Poles in<br/>great poverty, almost destitution, without food or fuel, without<br/>cigarettes, in debt to their landlady. The two hundred roubles they<br/>had carried off from Mitya at Mokroe had soon disappeared. But<br/>Grushenka was surprised at their meeting her with arrogant dignity<br/>and self-assertion, with the greatest punctilio and pompous<br/>speeches. Grushenka simply laughed, and gave her former admirer ten<br/>roubles. Then, laughing, she told Mitya of it and he was not in the<br/>least jealous. But ever since, the Poles had attached themselves to<br/>Grushenka and bombarded her daily with requests for money and she<br/>had always sent them small sums. And now that day Mitya had taken<br/>it into his head to be fearfully jealous.<br/><br/>"Like a fool, I went round to him just for a minute, on the way<br/>to see Mitya, for he is ill, too, my Pole," Grushenka began again<br/>with nervous haste. "I was laughing, telling Mitya about it.<br/>'Fancy,' I said, 'my Pole had the happy thought to sing his old<br/>songs to me to the guitar. He thought I would be touched and marry<br/>him!' Mitya leapt up swearingâ€¦ . So, there, I'll send them the<br/>pies! Fenya, is it that little girl they've sent? Here, give her<br/>three roubles and pack up a dozen pies in a paper and tell her to<br/>take them. And you, Alyosha, be sure to tell Mitya that I did send<br/>them the pies."<br/><br/>"I wouldn't tell him for anything," said Alyosha, smiling.<br/><br/>"Ech! You think he is unhappy about it. Why, he's jealous on<br/>purpose. He doesn't care," said Grushenka bitterly.<br/>
