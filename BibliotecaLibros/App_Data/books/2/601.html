"Yes, yes, for ever, for ever!" the boys cried in their ringing<br/>voices, with softened faces.<br/><br/>"Let us remember his face and his clothes and his poor little<br/>boots, his coffin and his unhappy, sinful father, and how boldly he<br/>stood up for him alone against the whole school."<br/><br/>"We will remember, we will remember," cried the boys. "He was<br/>brave, he was good!"<br/><br/>"Ah, how I loved him!" exclaimed Kolya.<br/><br/>"Ah, children, ah, dear friends, don't be afraid of life! How<br/>good life is when one does something good and just!"<br/><br/>"Yes, yes," the boys repeated enthusiastically.<br/><br/>"Karamazov, we love you!" a voice, probably Kartashov's, cried<br/>impulsively.<br/><br/>"We love you, we love you!" they all caught it up. There were<br/>tears in the eyes of many of them.<br/><br/>"Hurrah for Karamazov!" Kolya shouted ecstatically.<br/><br/>"And may the dead boy's memory live for ever!" Alyosha added<br/>again with feeling.<br/><br/>"For ever!" the boys chimed in again.<br/>
