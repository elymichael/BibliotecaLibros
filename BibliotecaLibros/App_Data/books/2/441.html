"Jump, Perezvon, beg! Beg!" shouted Kolya, jumping up, and the<br/>dog stood erect on its hind-legs by Ilusha's bedside. What followed<br/>was a surprise to everyone: Ilusha started, lurched violently<br/>forward, bent over Perezvon and gazed at him, faint with<br/>suspense.<br/><br/>"It's… Zhutchka!" he cried suddenly, in a voice breaking with<br/>joy and suffering.<br/><br/>"And who did you think it was?" Krassotkin shouted with all his<br/>might, in a ringing, happy voice, and bending down he seized the<br/>dog and lifted him up to Ilusha.<br/><br/>"Look, old man, you see, blind of one eye and the left ear is<br/>torn, just the marks you described to me. It was by that I found<br/>him. I found him directly. He did not belong to anyone!" he<br/>explained, to the captain, to his wife, to Alyosha and then again<br/>to Ilusha. "He used to live in the Fedotovs' backyard. Though he<br/>made his home there, they did not feed him. He was a stray dog that<br/>had run away from the village… I found him… . You see, old man, he<br/>couldn't have swallowed what you gave him. If he had, he must have<br/>died, he must have! So he must have spat it out, since he is alive.<br/>You did not see him do it. But the pin pricked his tongue, that is<br/>why he squealed. He ran away squealing and you thought he'd<br/>swallowed it. He might well squeal, because the skin of dogs'<br/>mouths is so tender… tenderer than in men, much tenderer!" Kolya<br/>cried impetuously, his face glowing and radiant with delight.<br/>Ilusha could not speak. White as a sheet, he gazed open-mouthed at<br/>Kolya, with his great eyes almost starting out of his head. And if<br/>Krassotkin, who had no suspicion of it, had known what a disastrous<br/>and fatal effect such a moment might have on the sick child's<br/>health, nothing would have induced him to play such a trick on him.<br/>But Alyosha was perhaps the only person in the room who realised<br/>it. As for the captain he behaved like a small child.<br/><br/>"Zhutchka! It's Zhutchka!" he cried in a blissful voice,<br/>"Ilusha, this is Zhutchka, your Zhutchka! Mamma, this is Zhutchka!"<br/>He was almost weeping.<br/><br/>"And I never guessed!" cried Smurov regretfully. "Bravo,<br/>Krassotkin! I said he'd find the dog and here he's found him."<br/><br/>"Here he's found him!" another boy repeated gleefully.<br/><br/>"Krassotkin's a brick! cried a third voice.<br/><br/>"He's a brick, he's a brick!" cried the other boys, and they<br/>began clapping.<br/><br/>"Wait, wait," Krassotkin did his utmost to shout above them all.<br/>"I'll tell you how it happened, that's the whole point. I found<br/>him, I took him home and hid him at once. I kept him locked up at<br/>home and did not show him to anyone till to-day. Only Smurov has<br/>known for the last fortnight, but I assured him this dog was called<br/>Perezvon and he did not guess. And meanwhile I taught the dog all<br/>sorts of tricks. You should only see all the things he can do! I<br/>trained him so as to bring you a well trained dog, in good<br/>condition, old man, so as to be able to say to you, 'See, old man,<br/>what a fine dog your Zhutchka is now!' Haven't you a bit of meat?<br/>He'll show you a trick that will make you die with laughing. A<br/>piece of meat, haven't you got any?"<br/><br/>The captain ran across the passage to the landlady, where their<br/>cooking was done. Not to lose precious time, Kolya, in desperate<br/>haste, shouted to Perezvon, "Dead!" And the dog immediately turned<br/>round and lay on his back with its four paws in the air. The boys<br/>laughed, Ilusha looked on with the same suffering smile, but the<br/>person most delighted with the dog's performance was "mamma." She<br/>laughed at the dog and began snapping her fingers and calling it,<br/>"Perezvon, Perezvon!"<br/>
