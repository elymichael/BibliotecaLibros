Now, listen and remember. In an hour's time the wine will<br/>arrive, savouries, pies, and sweets- bring them all up at once.<br/>That box Andrey has got is to be brought up at once, too. Open it,<br/>and hand champagne immediately. And the girls, we must have the<br/>girls, Marya especially."<br/><br/>He turned to the cart and pulled out the box of pistols.<br/><br/>"Here, Andrey, let's settle. Here's fifteen roubles for the<br/>drive, and fifty for vodka… for your readiness, for your love… .<br/>Remember Karamazov!"<br/><br/>"I'm afraid, sir," Andrey. "Give me five roubles extra, but more<br/>I won't take. Trifon Borissovitch, bear witness. Forgive my foolish<br/>words… "<br/><br/>"What are you afraid of?" asked Mitya, scanning him. "Well, go<br/>to the devil, if that's it?" he cried, flinging him five roubles.<br/>"Now, Trifon Borissovitch, take me up quietly and let me first get<br/>a look at them, so that they don't see me. Where are they? In the<br/>blue room?"<br/><br/>Trifon Borissovitch looked apprehensively at Mitya, but at once<br/>obediently did his bidding. Leading him into the passage, he went<br/>himself into the first large room, adjoining that in which the<br/>visitors were sitting, and took the light away. Then he stealthily<br/>led Mitya in, and put him in a corner in the dark, whence he could<br/>freely watch the company without being seen. But Mitya did not look<br/>long, and, indeed, he could not see them; he saw her, his heart<br/>throbbed violently, and all was dark before his eyes.<br/><br/>She was sitting sideways to the table in a low chair, and beside<br/>her, on the sofa, was the pretty youth, Kalganov. She was holding<br/>his hand and seemed to be laughing, while he, seeming vexed and not<br/>looking at her, was saying something in a loud voice to Maximov,<br/>who sat the other side of the table, facing Grushenka. Maximov was<br/>laughing violently at something. On the sofa sat he, and on a chair<br/>by the sofa there was another stranger. The one on the sofa was<br/>lolling backwards, smoking a pipe, and Mitya had an impression of a<br/>stoutish, broad-faced, short little man, who was apparently angry<br/>about something. His friend, the other stranger, struck Mitya as<br/>extraordinarily tall, but he could make out nothing more. He caught<br/>his breath. He could not bear it for a minute, he put the<br/>pistol-case on a chest, and with a throbbing heart he walked,<br/>feeling cold all over, straight into the blue room to face the<br/>company.<br/><br/>"Aie!" shrieked Grushenka, the first to notice him.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
