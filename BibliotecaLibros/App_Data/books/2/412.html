<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>2<br/>Children<br/><br/><br/>AND so on that frosty, snowy, and windy day in November, Kolya<br/>Krassotkin was sitting at home. It was Sunday and there was no<br/>school. It had just struck eleven, and he particularly wanted to go<br/>out "on very urgent business," but he was left alone in charge of<br/>the house, for it so happened that all its elder inmates were<br/>absent owing to a sudden and singular event. Madame Krassotkin had<br/>let two little rooms, separated from the rest of the house by a<br/>passage, to a doctor's wife with her two small children. This lady<br/>was the same age as Anna Fyodorovna, and a great friend of hers.<br/>Her husband, the doctor, had taken his departure twelve months<br/>before, going first to Orenburg and then to Tashkend, and for the<br/>last six months she had not heard a word from him. Had it not been<br/>for her friendship with Madame Krassotkin, which was some<br/>consolation to the forsaken lady, she would certainly have<br/>completely dissolved away in tears. And now, to add to her<br/>misfortunes, Katerina, her only servant, was suddenly moved the<br/>evening before to announce, to her mistress's amazement, that she<br/>proposed to bring a child into the world before morning. It seemed<br/>almost miraculous to everyone that no one had noticed the<br/>probability of it before. The astounded doctor's wife decided to<br/>move Katerina while there was still time to an establishment in the<br/>town kept by a midwife for such emergencies. As she set great store<br/>by her servant, she promptly carried out this plan and remained<br/>there looking after her. By the morning all Madame Krassotkin's<br/>friendly sympathy and energy were called upon to render assistance<br/>and appeal to someone for help in the case.<br/><br/>So both the ladies were absent from home, the Krassotkins'<br/>servant, Agafya, had gone out to the market, and Kolya was thus<br/>left for a time to protect and look after "the kids," that is, the<br/>son and daughter of the doctor's wife, who were left alone. Kolya<br/>was not afraid of taking care of the house, besides he had<br/>Perezvon, who had been told to lie flat, without moving, under the<br/>bench in the hall. Every time Kolya, walking to and fro through the<br/>rooms, came into the hall, the dog shook his head and gave two loud<br/>and insinuating taps on the floor with his tail, but alas! the<br/>whistle did not sound to release him. Kolya looked sternly at the<br/>luckless dog, who relapsed again into obedient rigidity. The one<br/>thing that troubled Kolya was "the kids." He looked, of course,<br/>with the utmost scorn on Katerina's unexpected adventure, but he<br/>was very fond of the bereaved "kiddies," and had already taken them<br/>a picture-book. Nastya, the elder, a girl of eight, could read, and<br/>Kostya, the boy, aged seven, was very fond of being read to by her.<br/>Krassotkin could, of course, have provided more diverting<br/>entertainment for them. He could have made them stand side by side<br/>and played soldiers with them, or sent them hiding all over the<br/>house. He had done so more than once before and was not above doing<br/>it, so much so that a report once spread at school that Krassotkin<br/>played horses with the little lodgers at home, prancing with his<br/>head on one side like a trace-horse. But Krassotkin haughtily<br/>parried this thrust, pointing out that to play horses with boys of<br/>one's own age, boys of thirteen, would certainly be disgraceful "at<br/>this date," but that he did it for the sake of "the kids" because<br/>he liked them, and no one had a right to call him to account for<br/>his feelings. The two "kids" adored him.<br/><br/>But on this occasion he was in no mood for games. He had very<br/>important business of his own before him, something almost<br/>mysterious. Meanwhile time was passing and Agafya, with whom he<br/>could have left the children, would not come back from market. He<br/>had several times already crossed the passage, opened the door of<br/>the lodgers' room and looked anxiously at "the kids" who were<br/>sitting over the book, as he had bidden them. Every time he opened<br/>the door they grinned at him, hoping he would come in and would do<br/>something delightful and amusing. But Kolya was bothered and did<br/>not go in.<br/><br/>At last it struck eleven and he made up his mind, once for all,<br/>that if that "damned" Agafya did not come back within ten minutes<br/>he should go out without waiting for her, making "the kids"<br/>promise, of course, to be brave when he was away, not to be<br/>naughty, not to cry from fright. With this idea he put on his<br/>wadded winter overcoat with its catskin fur collar, slung his<br/>satchel round his shoulder, and, regardless of his mother's<br/>constantly reiterated entreaties that he would always put on<br/>goloshes in such cold weather, he looked at them contemptuously as<br/>he crossed the hall and went out with only his boots on. Perezvon,<br/>seeing him in his outdoor clothes, began tapping nervously, yet<br/>vigorously, on the floor with his tail. Twitching all over, he even<br/>uttered a plaintive whine. But Kolya, seeing his dog's passionate<br/>excitement, decided that it was a breach of discipline, kept him<br/>for another minute under the bench, and only when he had opened the<br/>door into the passage, whistled for him. The dog leapt up like a<br/>mad creature and rushed bounding before him rapturously.<br/><br/>Kolya opened the door to peep at "the kids." They were both<br/>sitting as before at the table, not reading but warmly disputing<br/>about something. The children often argued together about various<br/>exciting problems of life, and Nastya, being the elder, always got<br/>the best of it. If Kostya did not agree with her, he almost always<br/>appealed to Kolya Krassotkin, and his verdict was regarded as<br/>infallible by both of them. This time the "kids"' discussion rather<br/>interested Krassotkin, and he stood still in the passage to listen.<br/>The children saw he was listening and that made them dispute with<br/>even greater energy.<br/><br/>"I shall never, never believe," Nastya prattled, "that the old<br/>women find babies among the cabbages in the kitchen garden. It's<br/>winter now and there are no cabbages, and so the old woman couldn't<br/>have taken Katerina a daughter."<br/><br/>Kolya whistled to himself.<br/>
