<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>10<br/>"It Was He Who Said That"<br/><br/><br/>ALYOSHA coming in told Ivan that a little over an hour ago Marya<br/>Kondratyevna had run to his rooms and informed him Smerdyakov had<br/>taken his own life. "I went in to clear away the samovar and he was<br/>hanging on a nail in the wall." On Alyosha's inquiring whether she<br/>had informed the police, she answered that she had told no one,<br/>"but I flew straight to you, I've run all the way." She seemed<br/>perfectly crazy, Alyosha reported, and was shaking like a leaf.<br/>When Alyosha ran with her to the cottage, he found Smerdyakov still<br/>hanging. On the table lay a note: "I destroy my life of my own will<br/>and desire, so as to throw no blame on anyone." Alyosha left the<br/>note on the table and went straight to the police captain and told<br/>him all about it. "And from him I've come straight to you," said<br/>Alyosha, in conclusion, looking intently into Ivan's face. He had<br/>not taken his eyes off him while he told his story, as though<br/>struck by something in his expression.<br/><br/>"Brother," he cried suddenly, "you must be terribly ill. You<br/>look and don't seem to understand what I tell you."<br/><br/>"It's a good thing you came," said Ivan, as though brooding, and<br/>not hearing Alyosha's exclamation. "I knew he had hanged<br/>himself."<br/><br/>"From whom?"<br/><br/>"I don't know. But I knew. Did I know? Yes, he told me. He told<br/>me so just now."<br/><br/>Ivan stood in the middle of the room, and still spoke in the<br/>same brooding tone, looking at the ground.<br/><br/>"Who is he?" asked Alyosha, involuntarily looking round.<br/>
