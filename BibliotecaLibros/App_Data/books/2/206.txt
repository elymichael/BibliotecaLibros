I had no sooner said this than they all three shouted at me.

"Upon my word," cried my adversary, annoyed, "if you did not
want to fight, why did not you let me alone?"

"Yesterday I was a fool, to-day I know better," I answered him
gaily.

"As to yesterday, I believe you, but as for to-day, it is
difficult to agree with your opinion," said he.

"Bravo," I cried, clapping my hands. "I agree with you there
too, I have deserved it!"

"Will you shoot, sir, or not?"

"No, I won't," I said; "if you like, fire at me again, but it
would be better for you not to fire."

The seconds, especially mine, were shouting too: "Can you
disgrace the regiment like this, facing your antagonist and begging
his forgiveness! If I'd only known this!"

I stood facing them all, not laughing now.

"Gentlemen," I said, "is it really so wonderful in these days to
find a man who can repent of his stupidity and publicly confess his
wrongdoing?"
