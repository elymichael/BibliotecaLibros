"I am glad to hear it," she snapped out maliciously, and she<br/>suddenly blushed.<br/><br/>"You don't know me yet, Alexey Fyodorovitch," she said<br/>menacingly. "And I don't know myself yet. Perhaps you'll want to<br/>trample me under foot after my examination to-morrow."<br/><br/>"You will give your evidence honourably," said Alyosha; "that's<br/>all that's wanted."<br/><br/>"Women are often dishonourable," she snarled. "Only an hour ago<br/>I was thinking I felt afraid to touch that monster… as though he<br/>were a reptile… but no, he is still a human being to me! But did he<br/>do it? Is he the murderer?" she cried, all of a sudden,<br/>hysterically, turning quickly to Ivan. Alyosha saw at once that she<br/>had asked Ivan that question before, perhaps only a moment before<br/>he came in, and not for the first time, but for the hundredth, and<br/>that they had ended by quarrelling.<br/><br/>"I've been to see Smerdyakov… . It was you, you who persuaded me<br/>that he murdered his father. It's only you I believed" she<br/>continued, still addressing Ivan. He gave her a sort of strained<br/>smile. Alyosha started at her tone. He had not suspected such<br/>familiar intimacy between them.<br/><br/>"Well, that's enough, anyway," Ivan cut short the conversation.<br/>"I am going. I'll come to-morrow." And turning at once, he walked<br/>out of the room and went straight downstairs.<br/><br/>With an imperious gesture, Katerina Ivanovna seized Alyosha by<br/>both hands.<br/><br/>"Follow him! Overtake him! Don't leave him alone for a minute!"<br/>she said, in a hurried whisper. "He's mad! Don't you know that he's<br/>mad? He is in a fever, nervous fever. The doctor told me so. Go,<br/>run after him… ."<br/><br/>Alyosha jumped up and ran after Ivan, who was not fifty paces<br/>ahead of him.<br/><br/>"What do you want?" He turned quickly on Alyosha, seeing that he<br/>was running after him. "She told you to catch me up, because I'm<br/>mad. I know it all by heart," he added irritably.<br/><br/>"She is mistaken, of course; but she is right that you are ill,"<br/>said Alyosha. "I was looking at your face just now. You look very<br/>ill, Ivan."<br/>
