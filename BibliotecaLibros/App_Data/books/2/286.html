"Wait a minute," Pyotr Ilyitch intervened listening and watching<br/>him uneasily, "you'd better go yourself and tell them. He'll muddle<br/>it."<br/><br/>"He will, I see he will! Eh, Misha! Why, I was going to kiss you<br/>for the commission… . If you don't make a mistake, there's ten<br/>roubles for you, run along, make haste… . Champagne's the chief<br/>thing, let them bring up champagne. And brandy, too, and red and<br/>white wine, and all I had then… . They know what I had then."<br/><br/>"But listen!" Pyotr Ilyitch interrupted with some impatience. "I<br/>say, let him simply run and change the money and tell them not to<br/>close, and you go and tell them… . Give him your note. Be off,<br/>Misha! Put your best leg forward!"<br/><br/>Pyotr Ilyitch seemed to hurry Misha off on purpose, because the<br/>boy remained standing with his mouth and eyes wide open, apparently<br/>understanding little of Mitya's orders, gazing up with amazement<br/>and terror at his bloodstained face and the trembling blood-stained<br/>fingers that held the notes.<br/><br/>"Well, now come and wash," said Pyotr Ilyitch sternly. "Put the<br/>money on the table or else in your pocket… . That's right, come<br/>along. But take off your coat."<br/><br/>And beginning to help him off with his coat, he cried out<br/>again:<br/><br/>"Look, your coat's covered with blood, too!"<br/><br/>"That… it's not the coat. It's only a little here on the sleeve…<br/>. And that's only here where the handkerchief lay. It must have<br/>soaked through. I must have sat on the handkerchief at Fenya's, and<br/>the blood's come through," Mitya explained at once with a<br/>child-like unconsciousness that was astounding. Pyotr Ilyitch<br/>listened, frowning.<br/><br/>"Well, you must have been up to something; you must have been<br/>fighting with someone," he muttered.<br/><br/>They began to wash. Pyotr Ilyitch held the jug and poured out<br/>the water. Mitya, in desperate haste, scarcely soaped his hands<br/>(they were trembling, and Pyotr Ilyitch remembered it afterwards).<br/>But the young official insisted on his soaping them thoroughly and<br/>rubbing them more. He seemed to exercise more and more sway over<br/>Mitya, as time went on. It may be noted in passing that he was a<br/>young man of sturdy character.<br/><br/>"Look, you haven't got your nails clean. Now rub your face;<br/>here, on your temples, by your ear… . Will you go in that shirt?<br/>Where are you going? Look, all the cuff of your right sleeve is<br/>covered with blood."<br/>
