<br/>"Do you know," he used often to say, looking at Alyosha, "that<br/>you are like her, 'the crazy woman'"- that was what he used to call<br/>his dead wife, Alyosha's mother. Grigory it was who pointed out the<br/>"crazy woman's" grave to Alyosha. He took him to our town cemetery<br/>and showed him in a remote corner a cast-iron tombstone, cheap but<br/>decently kept, on which were inscribed the name and age of the<br/>deceased and the date of her death, and below a four-lined verse,<br/>such as are commonly used on old-fashioned middle-class tombs. To<br/>Alyosha's amazement this tomb turned out to be Grigory's doing. He<br/>had put it up on the poor "crazy woman's" grave at his own expense,<br/>after Fyodor Pavlovitch, whom he had often pestered about the<br/>grave, had gone to Odessa, abandoning the grave and all his<br/>memories. Alyosha showed no particular emotion at the sight of his<br/>mother's grave. He only listened to Grigory's minute and solemn<br/>account of the erection of the tomb; he stood with bowed head and<br/>walked away without uttering a word. It was perhaps a year before<br/>he visited the cemetery again. But this little episode was not<br/>without an influence upon Fyodor Pavlovitch- and a very original<br/>one. He suddenly took a thousand roubles to our monastery to pay<br/>for requiems for the soul of his wife; but not for the second,<br/>Alyosha's mother, the "crazy woman," but for the first, Adelaida<br/>Ivanovna, who used to thrash him. In the evening of the same day he<br/>got drunk and abused the monks to Alyosha. He himself was far from<br/>being religious; he had probably never put a penny candle before<br/>the image of a saint. Strange impulses of sudden feeling and sudden<br/>thought are common in such types.<br/><br/>I have mentioned already that he looked bloated. His countenance<br/>at this time bore traces of something that testified unmistakably<br/>to the life he had led. Besides the long fleshy bags under his<br/>little, always insolent, suspicious, and ironical eyes; besides the<br/>multitude of deep wrinkles in his little fat face, the Adam's apple<br/>hung below his sharp chin like a great, fleshy goitre, which gave<br/>him a peculiar, repulsive, sensual appearance; add to that a long<br/>rapacious mouth with full lips, between which could be seen little<br/>stumps of black decayed teeth. He slobbered every time he began to<br/>speak. He was fond indeed of making fun of his own face, though, I<br/>believe, he was well satisfied with it. He used particularly to<br/>point to his nose, which was not very large, but very delicate and<br/>conspicuously aquiline. "A regular Roman nose," he used to say,<br/>"with my goitre I've quite the countenance of an ancient Roman<br/>patrician of the decadent period." He seemed proud of it.<br/><br/>Not long after visiting his mother's grave Alyosha suddenly<br/>announced that he wanted to enter the monastery, and that the monks<br/>were willing to receive him as a novice. He explained that this was<br/>his strong desire, and that he was solemnly asking his consent as<br/>his father. The old man knew that the elder Zossima, who was living<br/>in the monastery hermitage, had made a special impression upon his<br/>"gentle boy."<br/><br/>"That is the most honest monk among them, of course," he<br/>observed, after listening in thoughtful silence to Alyosha, and<br/>seeming scarcely surprised at his request. "H'm!… So that's where<br/>you want to be, my gentle boy?"<br/><br/>He was half drunk, and suddenly he grinned his slow half-drunken<br/>grin, which was not without a certain cunning and tipsy slyness.<br/>"H'm!… I had a presentiment that you would end in something like<br/>this. Would you believe it? You were making straight for it. Well,<br/>to be sure you have your own two thousand. That's a dowry for you.<br/>And I'll never desert you, my angel. And I'll pay what's wanted for<br/>you there, if they ask for it. But, of course, if they don't ask,<br/>why should we worry them? What do you say? You know, you spend<br/>money like a canary, two grains a week. H'm!… Do you know that near<br/>one monastery there's a place outside the town where every baby<br/>knows there are none but 'the monks' wives' living, as they are<br/>called. Thirty women, I believe. I have been there myself. You<br/>know, it's interesting in its way, of course, as a variety. The<br/>worst of it is it's awfully Russian. There are no French women<br/>there. Of course, they could get them fast enough, they have plenty<br/>of money. If they get to hear of it they'll come along. Well,<br/>there's nothing of that sort here, no 'monks' wives,' and two<br/>hundred monks. They're honest. They keep the fasts. I admit it… .<br/>H'm… . So you want to be a monk? And do you know I'm sorry to lose<br/>you, Alyosha; would you believe it, I've really grown fond of you?<br/>Well, it's a good opportunity. You'll pray for us sinners; we have<br/>sinned too much here. I've always been thinking who would pray for<br/>me, and whether there's anyone in the world to do it. My dear boy,<br/>I'm awfully stupid about that. You wouldn't believe it. Awfully.<br/>You see, however stupid I am about it, I keep thinking, I keep<br/>thinking- from time to time, of course, not all the while. It's<br/>impossible, I think, for the devils to forget to drag me down to<br/>hell with their hooks when I die. Then I wonder- hooks? Where would<br/>they get them? What of? Iron hooks? Where do they forge them? Have<br/>they a foundry there of some sort? The monks in the monastery<br/>probably believe that there's a ceiling in hell, for instance. Now<br/>I'm ready to believe in hell, but without a ceiling. It makes it<br/>more refined, more enlightened, more Lutheran that is. And, after<br/>all, what does it matter whether it has a ceiling or hasn't? But,<br/>do you know, there's a damnable question involved in it? If there's<br/>no ceiling there can be no hooks, and if there are no hooks it all<br/>breaks down, which is unlikely again, for then there would be none<br/>to drag me down to hell, and if they don't drag me down what<br/>justice is there in the world? Il faudrait les inventer,<br/>[1]<br/>those hooks, on purpose for me alone,<br/>for, if you only knew, Alyosha, what a black-guard I am." "But<br/>there are no hooks there," said Alyosha, looking gently and<br/>seriously at his father. "Yes, yes, only the shadows of hooks. I<br/>know, I know. That's how a Frenchman described hell: 'J'ai vu<br/>l'ombre d'un cocher qui avec l'ombre d'une brosse frottait l'ombre<br/>d'une carrosse.'<br/>[2]<br/>How do you know there are no hooks,<br/>darling? When you've lived with the monks you'll sing a different<br/>tune. But go and get at the truth there, and then come and tell me.<br/>Anyway it's easier going to the other world if one knows what there<br/>is there. Besides, it will be more seemly for you with the monks<br/>than here with me, with a drunken old man and young harlots… though<br/>you're like an angel, nothing touches you. And I dare say nothing<br/>will touch you there. That's why I let you go, because I hope for<br/>that. You've got all your wits about you. You will burn and you<br/>will burn out; you will be healed and come back again. And I will<br/>wait for you. I feel that you're the only creature in the world who<br/>has not condemned me. My dear boy, I feel it, you know. I can't<br/>help feeling it." And he even began blubbering. He was sentimental.<br/>He was wicked and sentimental.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
