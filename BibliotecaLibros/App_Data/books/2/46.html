<br/>"They all blame me, all of them!" cried Fyodor Pavlovitch in his<br/>turn. "Pyotr Alexandrovitch here blames me too. You have been<br/>blaming me, Pyotr Alexandrovitch, you have!" he turned suddenly to<br/>Miusov, although the latter was not dreaming of interrupting him.<br/>"They all accuse me of having hidden the children's money in my<br/>boots, and cheated them, but isn't there a court of law? There they<br/>will reckon out for you, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, from your notes, your<br/>letters, and your agreements, how much money you had, how much you<br/>have spent, and how much you have left. Why does Pyotr<br/>Alexandrovitch refuse to pass judgment? Dmitri is not a stranger to<br/>him. Because they are all against me, while Dmitri Fyodorovitch is<br/>in debt to me, and not a little, but some thousands of which I have<br/>documentary proof. The whole town is echoing with his debaucheries.<br/>And where he was stationed before, he several times spent a<br/>thousand or two for the seduction of some respectable girl; we know<br/>all about that, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, in its most secret details.<br/>I'll prove it… . Would you believe it, holy Father, he has<br/>captivated the heart of the most honourable of young ladies of good<br/>family and fortune, daughter of a gallant colonel, formerly his<br/>superior officer, who had received many honours and had the Anna<br/>Order on his breast. He compromised the girl by his promise of<br/>marriage, now she is an orphan and here; she is betrothed to him,<br/>yet before her very eyes he is dancing attendance on a certain<br/>enchantress. And although this enchantress has lived in, so to<br/>speak, civil marriage with a respectable man, yet she is of an<br/>independent character, an unapproachable fortress for everybody,<br/>just like a legal wife- for she is virtuous, yes, holy Fathers, she<br/>is virtuous. Dmitri Fyodorovitch wants to open this fortress with a<br/>golden key, and that's why he is insolent to me now, trying to get<br/>money from me, though he has wasted thousands on this enchantress<br/>already. He's continually borrowing money for the purpose. From<br/>whom do you think? Shall I say, Mitya?"<br/><br/>"Be silent!" cried Dmitri, "wait till I'm gone. Don't dare in my<br/>presence to asperse the good name of an honourable girl! That you<br/>should utter a word about her is an outrage, and I won't permit<br/>it!" He was breathless.<br/><br/>He was breathless. "Mitya! Mitya!" cried Fyodor Pavlovitch<br/>hysterically, squeezing out a tear. "And is your father's blessing<br/>nothing to you? If I curse you, what then?"<br/><br/>"Shameless hypocrite! "exclaimed Dmitri furiously.<br/><br/>"He says that to his father! his father What would he be with<br/>others? Gentlemen, only fancy; there's a poor but honourable man<br/>living here, burdened with a numerous family, a captain who got<br/>into trouble and was discharged from the army, but not publicly,<br/>not by court-martial, with no slur on his honour. And three weeks<br/>ago, Dmitri seized him by the beard in a tavern, dragged him out<br/>into the street and beat him publicly, and all because he is an<br/>agent in a little business of mine."<br/><br/>"It's all a lie! Outwardly it's the truth, but inwardly a lie!"<br/>Dmitri was trembling with rage. "Father, I don't justify my action.<br/>Yes, I confess it publicly, I behaved like a brute to that captain,<br/>and I regret it now, and I'm disgusted with myself for my brutal<br/>rage. But this captain, this agent of yours, went to that lady whom<br/>you call an enchantress, and suggested to her from you, that she<br/>should take I.O.U.s of mine which were in your possession, and<br/>should sue me for the money so as to get me into prison by means of<br/>them, if I persisted in claiming an account from you of my<br/>property. Now you reproach me for having a weakness for that lady<br/>when you yourself incited her to captivate me! She told me so to my<br/>face… . She told me the story and laughed at you… . You wanted to<br/>put me in prison because you are jealous of me with her, because<br/>you'd begun to force your attentions upon her; and I know all about<br/>that, too; she laughed at you for that as well- you hear- she<br/>laughed at you as she described it. So here you have this man, this<br/>father who reproaches his profligate son! Gentlemen, forgive my<br/>anger, but I foresaw that this crafty old man would only bring you<br/>together to create a scandal. I had come to forgive him if he held<br/>out his hand; to forgive him, and ask forgiveness! But as he has<br/>just this minute insulted not only me, but an honourable young<br/>lady, for whom I feel such reverence that I dare not take her name<br/>in vain, I have made up my mind to show up his game, though he is<br/>my father… ."<br/><br/>He could not go on. His eyes were glittering and he breathed<br/>with difficulty. But everyone in the cell was stirred. All except<br/>Father Zossima got up from their seats uneasily. The monks looked<br/>austere but waited for guidance from the elder. He sat still, pale,<br/>not from excitement but from the weakness of disease. An imploring<br/>smile lighted up his face; from time to time he raised his hand, as<br/>though to check the storm, and, of course, a gesture from him would<br/>have been enough to end the scene; but he seemed to be waiting for<br/>something and watched them intently as though trying to make out<br/>something which was not perfectly clear to him. At last Miusov felt<br/>completely humiliated and disgraced.<br/><br/>"We are all to blame for this scandalous scene," he said hotly.<br/>"But I did not foresee it when I came, though I knew with whom I<br/>had to deal. This must be stopped at once! Believe me, your<br/>reverence, I had no precise knowledge of the details that have just<br/>come to light, I was unwilling to believe them, and I learn for the<br/>first time… . A father is jealous of his son's relation with a<br/>woman of loose behaviour and intrigues with the creature to get his<br/>son into prison! This is the company in which I have been forced to<br/>be present! I was deceived. I declare to you all that I was as much<br/>deceived as anyone."<br/><br/>"Dmitri Fyodorovitch," yelled Fyodor Pavlovitch suddenly, in an<br/>unnatural voice, "if you were not my son I would challenge you this<br/>instant to a duel… with pistols, at three paces… across a<br/>handkerchief," he ended, stamping with both feet.<br/><br/>With old liars who have been acting all their lives there are<br/>moments when they enter so completely into their part that they<br/>tremble or shed tears of emotion in earnest, although at that very<br/>moment, or a second later, they are able to whisper to themselves,<br/>"You know you are lying, you shameless old sinner! You're acting<br/>now, in spite of your 'holy' wrath."<br/><br/>
