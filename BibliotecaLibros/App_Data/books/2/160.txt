Alyosha stood still, holding her hand in his. Suddenly he
stooped down and kissed her on her lips.

"Oh, what are you doing?" cried Lise. Alyosha was terribly
abashed.

"Oh, forgive me if I shouldn't… . Perhaps I'm awfully stupid… .
You said I was cold, so I kissed you… . But I see it was
stupid."

Lise laughed, and hid her face in her hands. "And in that
dress!" she ejaculated in the midst of her mirth. But she suddenly
ceased laughing and became serious, almost stern.

"Alyosha, we must put off kissing. We are not ready for that
yet, and we shall have a long time to wait," she ended suddenly.
"Tell me rather why you who are so clever, so intellectual, so
observant, choose a little idiot, an invalid like me? Ah, Alyosha,
I am awfully happy, for I don't deserve you a bit."

"You do, Lise. I shall be leaving the monastery altogether in a
few days. If I go into the world, I must marry. I know that. He
told me to marry, too. Whom could I marry better than you- and who
would have me except you? I have been thinking it over. In the
first place, you've known me from a child and you've a great many
qualities I haven't. You are more light-hearted than I am; above
all, you are more innocent than I am. I have been brought into
contact with many, many things already… . Ah, you don't know, but
I, too, am a Karamazov. What does it matter if you do laugh and
make jokes, and at me, too? Go on laughing. I am so glad you do.
You laugh like a little child, but you think like a martyr."

"Like a martyr? How?"

"Yes, Lise, your question just now: whether we weren't showing
contempt for that poor man by dissecting his soul- that was the
question of a sufferer… . You see, I don't know how to express it,
but anyone who thinks of such questions is capable of suffering.
Sitting in your invalid chair you must have thought over many
things already."

"Alyosha, give me your hand. Why are you taking it away?"
murmured Lise in a failing voice, weak with happiness. "Listen,
Alyosha. What will you wear when you come out of the monastery?
What sort of suit? Don't laugh, don't be angry, it's very, very
important to me."

"I haven't thought about the suit, Lise; But I'll wear whatever
you like."

"I should like you to have a dark blue velvet coat, a white
pique waistcoat, and a soft grey felt hat… . Tell me, did you
believe that I didn't care for you when I said I didn't mean what I
wrote?"
