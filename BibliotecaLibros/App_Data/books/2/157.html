<br/>Alyosha sat down to the table and began to tell his story, but<br/>at the first words he lost his embarrassment and gained the whole<br/>of Lise's attention as well. He spoke with deep feeling, under the<br/>influence of the strong impression he had just received, and he<br/>succeeded in telling his story well and circumstantially. In old<br/>days in Moscow he had been fond of coming to Lise and describing to<br/>her what had just happened to him, what he had read, or what he<br/>remembered of his childhood. Sometimes they had made day-dreams and<br/>woven whole romances together- generally cheerful and amusing ones.<br/>Now they both felt suddenly transported to the old days in Moscow,<br/>two years before. Lise was extremely touched by his story. Alyosha<br/>described Ilusha with warm feeling. When he finished describing how<br/>the luckless man trampled on the money, Lise could not help<br/>clasping her hands and crying out:<br/><br/>"So you didn't give him the money! So you let him run away! Oh,<br/>dear, you ought to have run after him!"<br/><br/>"No, Lise; it's better I didn't run after him," said Alyosha,<br/>getting up from his chair and walking thoughtfully across the<br/>room.<br/><br/>"How so? How is it better? Now they are without food and their<br/>case is hopeless."<br/><br/>"Not hopeless, for the two hundred roubles will still come to<br/>them. He'll take the money to-morrow. To-morrow he will be sure to<br/>take it," said Alyosha, pacing up and down, pondering. "You see,<br/>Lise," he went on, stopping suddenly before her, "I made one<br/>blunder, but that, even that, is all for the best."<br/><br/>"What blunder, and why is it for the best?"<br/><br/>"I'll tell you. He is a man of weak and timorous character; he<br/>has suffered so much and is very good-natured. I keep wondering why<br/>he took offence so suddenly, for I assure you, up to the last<br/>minute, he did not know that he was going to trample on the notes.<br/>And I think now that there was a great deal to offend him… and it<br/>could not have been otherwise in his position… . To begin with, he<br/>was sore at having been so glad of the money in my presence and not<br/>having concealed it from me. If he had been pleased, but not so<br/>much; if he had not shown it; if he had begun affecting scruples<br/>and difficulties, as other people do when they take money, he might<br/>still endure- to take it. But he was too genuinely delighted, and<br/>that was mortifying. Ah, Lise, he is a good and truthful man-<br/>that's the worst of the whole business. All the while he talked,<br/>his voice was so weak, so broken, he talked so fast, so fast, he<br/>kept laughing such a laugh, or perhaps he was crying- yes, I am<br/>sure he was crying, he was so delighted- and he talked about his<br/>daughters- and about the situation he could get in another town… .<br/>And when he had poured out his heart, he felt ashamed at having<br/>shown me his inmost soul like that. So he began to hate me at once.<br/>He is one of those awfully sensitive poor people. What had made him<br/>feel most ashamed was that he had given in too soon and accepted me<br/>as a friend, you see. At first he almost flew at me and tried to<br/>intimidate me, but as soon as he saw the money he had begun<br/>embracing me; he kept touching me with his hands. This must have<br/>been how he came to feel it all so humiliating, and then I made<br/>that blunder, a very important one. I suddenly said to him that if<br/>he had not money enough to move to another town, we would give it<br/>to him, and, indeed, I myself would give him as much as he wanted<br/>out of my own money. That struck him all at once. Why, he thought,<br/>did I put myself forward to help him? You know, Lise, it's awfully<br/>hard for a man who has been injured, when other people look at him<br/>as though they were his benefactors… . I've heard that; Father<br/>Zossima told me so. I don't know how to put it, but I have often<br/>seen it myself. And I feel like that myself, too. And the worst of<br/>it was that though he did not know, to the very last minute, that<br/>he would trample on the notes, he had a kind of presentiment of it,<br/>I am sure of that. That's just what made him so ecstatic, that he<br/>had that presentiment… . And though it's so dreadful, it's all for<br/>the best. In fact, I believe nothing better could have<br/>happened."<br/><br/>"Why, why could nothing better have happened?" cried Lise,<br/>looking with great surprise at Alyosha.<br/><br/>"Because if he had taken the money, in an hour after getting<br/>home, he would be crying with mortification, that's just what would<br/>have happened. And most likely he would have come to me early<br/>to-morrow, and perhaps have flung the notes at me and trampled upon<br/>them as he did just now. But now he has gone home awfully proud and<br/>triumphant, though he knows he has 'ruined himself.' So now nothing<br/>could be easier than to make him accept the two hundred roubles by<br/>to-morrow, for he has already vindicated his honour, tossed away<br/>the money, and trampled it under foot… . He couldn't know when he<br/>did it that I should bring it to him again to-morrow, and yet he is<br/>in terrible need of that money. Though he is proud of himself now,<br/>yet even to-day he'll be thinking what a help he has lost. He will<br/>think of it more than ever at night, will dream of it, and by<br/>to-morrow morning he may be ready to run to me to ask forgiveness.<br/>It's just then that I'll appear. 'Here, you are a proud man,' I<br/>shall say: 'you have shown it; but now take the money and forgive<br/>us!' And then he will take it!<br/><br/>Alyosha was carried away with joy as he uttered his last words,<br/>"And then he will take it!" Lise clapped her hands.<br/><br/>
