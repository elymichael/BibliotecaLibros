<br/>"Brother," Alyosha interposed, "restrain yourself. It was not<br/>you murdered him. It's not true!"<br/><br/>"That's what he says, he, and he knows it. 'You are going to<br/>perform an act of heroic virtue, and you don't believe in virtue;<br/>that's what tortures you and makes you angry, that's why you are so<br/>vindictive.' He said that to me about me and he knows what he<br/>says."<br/><br/>"It's you say that, not he," exclaimed Alyosha mournfully, "and<br/>you say it because you are ill and delirious, tormenting<br/>yourself."<br/><br/>"No, he knows what he says. 'You are going from pride,' he says.<br/>'You'll stand up and say it was I killed him, and why do you writhe<br/>with horror? You are lying! I despise your opinion, I despise your<br/>horror!' He said that about me. 'And do you know you are longing<br/>for their praise- "he is a criminal, a murderer, but what a<br/>generous soul; he wanted to save his brother and he confessed."<br/>That's a lie Alyosha!" Ivan cried suddenly, with flashing eyes. "I<br/>don't want the low rabble to praise me, I swear I don't! That's a<br/>lie! That's why I threw the glass at him and it broke against his<br/>ugly face."<br/><br/>"Brother, calm yourself, stop!" Alyosha entreated him.<br/><br/>"Yes, he knows how to torment one. He's cruel," Ivan went on,<br/>unheeding. "I had an inkling from the first what he came for.<br/>'Granting that you go through pride, still you had a hope that<br/>Smerdyakov might be convicted and sent to Siberia, and Mitya would<br/>be acquitted, while you would only be punished, with moral<br/>condemnation' ('Do you hear?' he laughed then)- 'and some people<br/>will praise you. But now Smerdyakov's dead, he has hanged himself,<br/>and who'll believe you alone? But yet you are going, you are going,<br/>you'll go all the same, you've decided to go. What are you going<br/>for now?' That's awful, Alyosha. I can't endure such questions. Who<br/>dare ask me such questions?"<br/><br/>"Brother," interposed Alyosha- his heart sank with terror, but<br/>he still seemed to hope to bring Ivan to reason- "how could he have<br/>told you of Smerdyakov's death before I came, when no one knew of<br/>it and there was no time for anyone to know of it?"<br/><br/>"He told me," said Ivan firmly, refusing to admit a doubt. "It<br/>was all he did talk about, if you come to that. 'And it would be<br/>all right if you believed in virtue,' he said. 'No matter if they<br/>disbelieve you, you are going for the sake of principle. But you<br/>are a little pig like Fyodor Pavlovitch, and what do you want with<br/>virtue? Why do you want to go meddling if your sacrifice is of no<br/>use to anyone? Because you don't know yourself why you go! Oh,<br/>you'd give a great deal to know yourself why you go! And can you<br/>have made up your mind? You've not made up your mind. You'll sit<br/>all night deliberating whether to go or not. But you will go; you<br/>know you'll go. You know that whichever way you decide, the<br/>decision does not depend on you. You'll go because you won't dare<br/>not to go. Why won't you dare? You must guess that for yourself.<br/>That's a riddle for you!' He got up and went away. You came and he<br/>went. He called me a coward, Alyosha! Le mot de l'enigme is that I<br/>am a coward. 'It is not for such eagles to soar above the earth.'It<br/>was he added that- he! And Smerdyakov said the same. He must be<br/>killed! Katya despises me. I've seen that for a month past. Even<br/>Lise will begin to despise me! 'You are going in order to be<br/>praised.' That's a brutal lie! And you despise me too, Alyosha. Now<br/>I am going to hate you again! And I hate the monster, too! I hate<br/>the monster! I don't want to save the monster. Let him rot in<br/>Siberia! He's begun singing a hymn! Oh, to-morrow I'll go, stand<br/>before them, and spit in their faces!"<br/><br/>He jumped up in a frenzy, flung off the towel, and fell to<br/>pacing up and down the room again. Alyosha recalled what he had<br/>just said. "I seem to be sleeping awake… I walk, I speak, I see,<br/>but I am asleep." It seemed to be just like that now. Alyosha did<br/>not leave him. The thought passed through his mind to run for a<br/>doctor, but he was afraid to leave his brother alone: there was no<br/>one to whom he could leave him. By degrees Ivan lost consciousness<br/>completely at last. He still went on talking, talking incessantly,<br/>but quite incoherently, and even articulated his words with<br/>difficulty. Suddenly he staggered violently; but Alyosha was in<br/>time to support him. Ivan let him lead him to his bed. Alyosha<br/>undressed him somehow and put him to bed. He sat watching over him<br/>for another two hours. The sick man slept soundly, without<br/>stirring, breathing softly and evenly. Alyosha took a pillow and<br/>lay down on the sofa, without undressing.<br/><br/>As he fell asleep he prayed for Mitya and Ivan. He began to<br/>understand Ivan's illness. "The anguish of a proud determination.<br/>An earnest conscience!" God, in Whom he disbelieved, and His truth<br/>were gaining mastery over his heart, which still refused to submit.<br/>"Yes," the thought floated through Alyosha's head as it lay on the<br/>pillow, "yes, if Smerdyakov is dead, no one will believe Ivan's<br/>evidence; but he will go and give it." Alyosha smiled softly. "God<br/>will conquer!" he thought. "He will either rise up in the light of<br/>truth, or… he'll perish in hate, revenging on himself and on<br/>everyone his having served the cause he does not believe in,"<br/>Alyosha added bitterly, and again he prayed for Ivan.<br/><br/>
