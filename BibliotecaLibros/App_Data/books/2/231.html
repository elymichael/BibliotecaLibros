The incident he referred to was this. One of the monks was<br/>haunted in his dreams and, later on, in waking moments, by visions<br/>of evil spirits. When in the utmost terror he confided this to<br/>Father Zossima, the elder had advised continual prayer and rigid<br/>fasting. But when that was of no use, he advised him while<br/>persisting in prayer and fasting, to take a special medicine. Many<br/>persons were shocked at the time and wagged their heads as they<br/>talked over it- and most of all Father Ferapont, to whom some of<br/>the censorious had hastened to report this "extraordinary" counsel<br/>on the part of the elder.<br/><br/>"Go away, Father!" said Father Paissy, in a commanding voice,<br/>"it's not for man to judge but for God. Perhaps we see here a<br/>'sign' which neither you, nor I, nor anyone of us is able to<br/>comprehend. Go, Father, and do not trouble the flock!" he repeated<br/>impressively.<br/><br/>"He did not keep the fasts according to the rule and therefore<br/>the sign has come. That is clear and it's a sin to hide it," the<br/>fanatic, carried away by a zeal that outstripped his reason, would<br/>not be quieted. "He was seduced by sweetmeats, ladies brought them<br/>to him in their pockets, he sipped tea, he worshipped his belly,<br/>filling it with sweet things and his mind with haughty thoughts… .<br/>And for this he is put to shame… ."<br/><br/>"You speak lightly, Father." Father Paissy, too, raised his<br/>voice. "I admire your fasting and severities, but you speak lightly<br/>like some frivolous youth, fickle and childish. Go away, Father, I<br/>command you!" Father Paissy thundered in conclusion.<br/><br/>"I will go," said Ferapont, seeming somewhat taken aback, but<br/>still as bitter. "You learned men! You are so clever you look down<br/>upon my humbleness. I came hither with little learning and here I<br/>have forgotten what I did know; God Himself has preserved me in my<br/>weakness from your subtlety."<br/><br/>Father Paissy stood over him, waiting resolutely. Father<br/>Ferapont paused and, suddenly leaning his cheek on his hand<br/>despondently, pronounced in a sing-song, voice, looking at the<br/>coffin of the dead elder:<br/><br/>"To-morrow they will sing over him 'Our Helper and Defender'- a<br/>splendid anthem- and over me when I die all they'll sing will be<br/>'What Earthly Joy'- a little cantical,"<br/>[10]<br/>he added<br/>with tearful regret. "You are proud and puffed up, this is a vain<br/>place!" he shouted suddenly like a madman, and with a wave of his<br/>hand he turned quickly and quickly descended the steps. The crowd<br/>awaiting him below wavered; some followed him at once and some<br/>lingered, for the cell was still open, and Father Paissy, following<br/>Father Ferapont on to the steps, stood watching him. the excited<br/>old fanatic was not completely silenced. Walking twenty steps away,<br/>he suddenly turned towards the setting sun, raised both his arms<br/>and, as though someone had cut him down, fell to the ground with a<br/>loud scream. "My God has conquered! Christ has conquered the<br/>setting sun!" he shouted frantically, stretching up his hands to<br/>the sun, and falling face downwards on the ground, he sobbed like a<br/>little child, shaken by his tears and spreading out his arms on the<br/>ground. Then all rushed up to him; there were exclamations and<br/>sympathetic sobs… a kind of frenzy seemed to take possession of<br/>them all. "This is the one who is a saint! This is the one who is a<br/>holy man!" some cried aloud, losing their fear. "This is he who<br/>should be an elder," others added malignantly. "He wouldn't be an<br/>elder… he would refuse… he wouldn't serve a cursed innovation… he<br/>wouldn't imitate their foolery," other voices chimed in at once.<br/>And it is hard to say how far they might have gone, but at that<br/>moment the bell rang summoning them to service. All began crossing<br/>themselves at once. Father Ferapont, too, got up and crossing<br/>himself went back to his cell without looking round, still uttering<br/>exclamations which were utterly incoherent. A few followed him, but<br/>the greater number dispersed, hastening to service. Father Paissy<br/>let Father Iosif read in his place and went down. The frantic<br/>outcries of bigots could not shake him, but his heart was suddenly<br/>filled with melancholy for some special reason and he felt that. He<br/>stood still and suddenly wondered, "Why am I sad even to<br/>dejection?" and immediately grasped with surprise that his sudden<br/>sadness was due to a very small and special cause. In the crowd<br/>thronging at the entrance to the cell, he had noticed Alyosha and<br/>he remembered that he had felt at once a pang at heart on seeing<br/>him. "Can that boy mean so much to my heart now?" he asked himself,<br/>wondering. At that moment Alyosha passed him, hurrying away, but<br/>not in the direction of the church. Their eyes met. Alyosha quickly<br/>turned away his eyes and dropped them to the ground, and from the<br/>boy's look alone, Father Paissy guessed what a great change was<br/>taking place in him at that moment. "Have you, too, fallen into<br/>temptation?" cried Father Paissy. "Can you be with those of little<br/>faith?" he added mournfully. Alyosha stood still and gazed vaguely<br/>at Father Paissy, but quickly turned his eyes away again and again<br/>looked on the ground. He stood sideways and did not turn his face<br/>to Father Paissy, who watched him attentively. "Where are you<br/>hastening? The bell calls to service," he asked again, but again<br/>Alyosha gave no answer. "Are you leaving the hermitage? What,<br/>without asking leave, without asking a blessing?" Alyosha suddenly<br/>gave a wry smile, cast a strange, very strange, look at the Father<br/>to whom his former guide, the former sovereign of his heart and<br/>mind, his beloved elder, had confided him as he lay dying. And<br/>suddenly, still without speaking, waved his hand, as though not<br/>caring even to be respectful, and with rapid steps walked towards<br/>the gates away from the hermitage. "You will come back again!"<br/>murmured Father Paissy, looking after him with sorrowful<br/>surprise.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
