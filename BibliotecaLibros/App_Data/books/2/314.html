"But did you serve in the cavalry? You were talking about the<br/>cavalry. Were you a cavalry officer?" put in Kalgonov at once.<br/><br/>"Was he a cavalry officer indeed? Ha ha!" cried Mitya, listening<br/>eagerly, and turning his inquiring eyes to each as he spoke, as<br/>though there were no knowing what he might hear from each.<br/><br/>"No, you see," Maximov turned to him. "What I mean is that those<br/>pretty Polish ladies&#160;… when they danced the mazurka with our<br/>Uhlans… when one of them dances a mazurka with a Uhlan she jumps on<br/>his knee like a kitten… a little white one… and the pan-father and<br/>pan-mother look on and allow it… They allow it… and next day the<br/>Uhlan comes and offers her his hand… . That's how it is… offers her<br/>his hand, he he!" Maximov ended, tittering.<br/><br/>"The pan is a lajdak!"* the tall Pole on the chair growled<br/>suddenly and crossed one leg over the other. Mitya's eye was caught<br/>by his huge greased boot, with its thick, dirty sole. The dress of<br/>both the Poles looked rather greasy.<br/><br/>* Scoundrel.<br/><br/>"Well, now it's lajdak! What's he scolding about?" said<br/>Grushenka, suddenly vexed.<br/><br/>"Pani Agrippina, what the gentleman saw in Poland were servant<br/>girls, and not ladies of good birth," the Pole with the pipe<br/>observed to Grushenka.<br/><br/>"You can reckon on that," the tall Pole snapped<br/>contemptuously.<br/><br/>"What next! Let him talk! People talk, why hinder them? It makes<br/>it cheerful," Grushenka said crossly.<br/><br/>"I'm not hindering them, pani," said the Pole in the wig, with a<br/>long look at Grushenka, and relapsing into dignified silence he<br/>sucked his pipe again.<br/><br/>"No, no. The Polish gentleman spoke the truth." Kalgonov got<br/>excited again, as though it were a question of vast import. "He's<br/>never been in Poland, so how can he talk about it? I suppose you<br/>weren't married in Poland, were you?"<br/>
