<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>2<br/>For a Moment the Lie Becomes Truth<br/><br/><br/>HE hurried to the hospital where Mitya was lying now. The day<br/>after his fate was determined, Mitya had fallen ill with nervous<br/>fever, and was sent to the prison division of the town hospital.<br/>But at the request of several persons (Alyosha, Madame Hohlakov,<br/>Lise, etc.), Doctor Varvinsky had put Mitya not with other<br/>prisoners, but in a separate little room, the one where Smerdyakov<br/>had been. It is true that there was a sentinel at the other end of<br/>the corridor, and there was a grating over the window, so that<br/>Varvinsky could be at ease about the indulgence he had shown, which<br/>was not quite legal, indeed; but he was a kind-hearted and<br/>compassionate young man. He knew how hard it would be for a man<br/>like Mitya to pass at once so suddenly into the society of robbers<br/>and murderers, and that he must get used to it by degrees. The<br/>visits of relations and friends were informally sanctioned by the<br/>doctor and overseer, and even by the police captain. But only<br/>Alyosha and Grushenka had visited Mitya. Rakitin had tried to force<br/>his way in twice, but Mitya persistently begged Varvinsky not to<br/>admit him.<br/><br/>Alyosha found him sitting on his bed in a hospital dressing<br/>gown, rather feverish, with a towel, soaked in vinegar and water,<br/>on his head. He looked at Alyosha as he came in with an undefined<br/>expression, but there was a shade of something like dread<br/>discernible in it. He had become terribly preoccupied since the<br/>trial; sometimes he would be silent for half an hour together, and<br/>seemed to be pondering something heavily and painfully, oblivious<br/>of everything about him. If he roused himself from his brooding and<br/>began to talk, he always spoke with a kind of abruptness and never<br/>of what he really wanted to say. He looked sometimes with a face of<br/>suffering at his brother. He seemed to be more at ease with<br/>Grushenka than with Alyosha. It is true, he scarcely spoke to her<br/>at all, but as soon as she came in, his whole face lighted up with<br/>joy.<br/><br/>Alyosha sat down beside him on the bed in silence. This time<br/>Mitya was waiting for Alyosha in suspense, but he did not dare ask<br/>him a question. He felt it almost unthinkable that Katya would<br/>consent to come, and at the same time he felt that if she did not<br/>come, something inconceivable would happen. Alyosha understood his<br/>feelings.<br/><br/>"Trifon Borissovitch," Mitya began nervously, "has pulled his<br/>whole inn to pieces, I am told. He's taken up the flooring, pulled<br/>apart the planks, split up all the gallery, I am told. He is<br/>seeking treasure all the time- the fifteen hundred roubles which<br/>the prosecutor said I'd hidden there. He began playing these<br/>tricks, they say, as soon as he got home. Serve him right, the<br/>swindler! The guard here told me yesterday; he comes from<br/>there."<br/><br/>"Listen," began Alyosha. "She will come, but I don't know when.<br/>Perhaps to-day, perhaps in a few days, that I can't tell. But she<br/>will come, she will, that's certain."<br/><br/>Mitya started, would have said something, but was silent. The<br/>news had a tremendous effect on him. It was evident that he would<br/>have liked terribly to know what had been said, but he was again<br/>afraid to ask. Something cruel and contemptuous from Katya would<br/>have cut him like a knife at that moment.<br/><br/>"This was what she said among other things; that I must be sure<br/>to set your conscience at rest about escaping. If Ivan is not well<br/>by then she will see to it all herself."<br/>
