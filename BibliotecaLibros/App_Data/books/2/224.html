(h) Can a Man judge his Fellow Creatures? Faith to the End.<br/><br/>Remember particularly that you cannot be a judge of anyone. For<br/>no one can judge a criminal until he recognises that he is just<br/>such a criminal as the man standing before him, and that he perhaps<br/>is more than all men to blame for that crime. When he understands<br/>that, he will be able to be a judge. Though that sounds absurd, it<br/>is true. If I had been righteous myself, perhaps there would have<br/>been no criminal standing before me. If you can take upon yourself<br/>the crime of the criminal your heart is judging, take it at once,<br/>suffer for him yourself, and let him go without reproach. And even<br/>if the law itself makes you his judge, act in the same spirit so<br/>far as possible, for he will go away and condemn himself more<br/>bitterly than you have done. If, after your kiss, he goes away<br/>untouched, mocking at you, do not let that be a stumbling-block to<br/>you. It shows his time has not yet come, but it will come in due<br/>course. And if it come not, no Matter; if not he, then another in<br/>his place will understand and suffer, and judge and condemn<br/>himself, and the truth will be fulfilled. Believe that, believe it<br/>without doubt; for in that lies all the hope and faith of the<br/>saints.<br/><br/>Work without ceasing. If you remember in the night as you go to<br/>sleep, "I have not done what I ought to have done," rise up at once<br/>and do it. If the people around you are spiteful and callous and<br/>will not hear you, fall down before them and beg their forgiveness;<br/>for in truth you are to blame for their not wanting to hear you.<br/>And if you cannot speak to them in their bitterness, serve them in<br/>silence and in humility, never losing hope. If all men abandon you<br/>and even drive you away by force, then when you are left alone fall<br/>on the earth and kiss it, water it with your tears and it will<br/>bring forth fruit even though no one has seen or heard you in your<br/>solitude. Believe to the end, even if all men went astray and you<br/>were left the only one faithful; bring your offering even then and<br/>praise God in your loneliness. And if two of you are gathered<br/>together- then there is a whole world, a world of living love.<br/>Embrace each other tenderly and praise God, for if only in you two<br/>His truth has been fulfilled.<br/><br/>If you sin yourself and grieve even unto death for your sins or<br/>for your sudden sin, then rejoice for others, rejoice for the<br/>righteous man, rejoice that if you have sinned, he is righteous and<br/>has not sinned.<br/><br/>If the evil-doing of men moves you to indignation and<br/>overwhelming distress, even to a desire for vengeance on the<br/>evil-doers, shun above all things that feeling. Go at once and seek<br/>suffering for yourself, as though you were yourself guilty of that<br/>wrong. Accept that suffering and bear it and your heart will find<br/>comfort, and you will understand that you too are guilty, for you<br/>might have been a light to the evil-doers, even as the one man<br/>sinless, and you were not a light to them. If you had been a light,<br/>you would have lightened the path for others too, and the evil-doer<br/>might perhaps have been saved by your light from his sin. And even<br/>though your light was shining, yet you see men were not saved by<br/>it, hold firm and doubt not the power of the heavenly light.<br/>Believe that if they were not saved, they will be saved hereafter.<br/>And if they are not saved hereafter, then their sons will be saved,<br/>for your light will not die even when you are dead. The righteous<br/>man departs, but his light remains. Men are always saved after the<br/>death of the deliverer. Men reject their prophets and slay them,<br/>but they love their martyrs and honour those whom they have slain.<br/>You are working for the whole, are acting for the future. Seek no<br/>reward, for great is your reward on this earth: the spiritual joy<br/>which is only vouchsafed to the righteous man. Fear not the great<br/>nor the mighty, but be wise and ever serene. Know the measure, know<br/>the times, study that. When you are left alone, pray. Love to throw<br/>yourself on the earth and kiss it. Kiss the earth and love it with<br/>an unceasing, consuming love. Love all men, love everything. Seek<br/>that rapture and ecstasy. Water the earth with the tears of your<br/>joy and love those tears. Don't be ashamed of that ecstasy, prize<br/>it, for it is a gift of God and a great one; it is not given to<br/>many but only to the elect.<br/><br/>(i) Of Hell and Hell Fire, a Mystic Reflection.<br/><br/>Fathers and teachers, I ponder, "What is hell?" I maintain that<br/>it is the suffering of being unable to love. Once in infinite<br/>existence, immeasurable in time and space, a spiritual creature was<br/>given on his coming to earth the power of saying, "I am and I<br/>love." Once, only once, there was given him a moment of active<br/>lifting love, and for that was earthly life given him, and with it<br/>times and seasons. And that happy creature rejected the priceless<br/>gift, prized it and loved it not, scorned it and remained callous.<br/>Such a one, having left the earth, sees Abraham's bosom and talks<br/>with Abraham as we are told in the parable of the rich man and<br/>Lazarus, and beholds heaven and can go up to the Lord. But that is<br/>just his torment, to rise up to the Lord without ever having loved,<br/>to be brought close to those who have loved when he has despised<br/>their love. For he sees clearly and says to himself, "Now I have<br/>understanding, and though I now thirst to love, there will be<br/>nothing great, no sacrifice in my love, for my earthly life is<br/>over, and Abraham will not come even with a drop of living water<br/>(that is the gift of earthly active life) to cool the fiery thirst<br/>of spiritual love which burns in me now, though I despised it on<br/>earth; there is no more life for me and will be no more time! Even<br/>though I would gladly give my life for others, it can never be, for<br/>that life is passed which can be sacrificed for love, and now there<br/>is a gulf fixed between that life and this existence."<br/><br/>They talk of hell fire in the material sense. I don't go into<br/>that mystery and I shun it. But I think if there were fire in<br/>material sense, they would be glad of it, for I imagine that in<br/>material agony, their still greater spiritual agony would be<br/>forgotten for a moment. Moreover, that spiritual agony cannot be<br/>taken from them, for that suffering is not external but within<br/>them. And if it could be taken from them, I think it would be<br/>bitterer still for the unhappy creatures. For even if the righteous<br/>in Paradise forgave them, beholding their torments, and called them<br/>up to heaven in their infinite love, they would only multiply their<br/>torments, for they would arouse in them still more keenly a flaming<br/>thirst for responsive, active and grateful love which is now<br/>impossible. In the timidity of my heart I imagine, however, that<br/>the very recognition of this impossibility would serve at last to<br/>console them. For accepting the love of the righteous together with<br/>the impossibility of repaying it, by this submissiveness and the<br/>effect of this humility, they will attain at last, as it were, to a<br/>certain semblance of that active love which they scorned in life,<br/>to something like its outward expression… I am sorry, friends and<br/>brothers, that I cannot express this clearly. But woe to those who<br/>have slain themselves on earth, woe to the suicides! I believe that<br/>there can be none more miserable than they. They tell us that it is<br/>a sin to pray for them and outwardly the Church, as it were,<br/>renounces them, but in my secret heart I believe that we may pray<br/>even for them. Love can never be an offence to Christ. For such as<br/>those I have prayed inwardly all my life, I confess it, fathers and<br/>teachers, and even now I pray for them every day.<br/><br/>Oh, there are some who remain proud and fierce even in hell, in<br/>spite of their certain knowledge and contemplation of the absolute<br/>truth; there are some fearful ones who have given themselves over<br/>to Satan and his proud spirit entirely. For such, hell is voluntary<br/>and ever consuming; they are tortured by their own choice. For they<br/>have cursed themselves, cursing God and life. They live upon their<br/>vindictive pride like a starving man in the desert sucking blood<br/>out of his own body. But they are never satisfied, and they refuse<br/>forgiveness, they curse God Who calls them. They cannot behold the<br/>living God without hatred, and they cry out that the God of life<br/>should be annihilated, that God should destroy Himself and His own<br/>creation. And they will burn in the fire of their own wrath for<br/>ever and yearn for death and annihilation. But they will not attain<br/>to death… .<br/><br/>Here Alexey Fyodorovitch Karamazov's manuscript ends. I repeat,<br/>it is incomplete and fragmentary. Biographical details, for<br/>instance, cover only Father Zossima's earliest youth. Of his<br/>teaching and opinions we find brought together sayings evidently<br/>uttered on very different occasions. His utterances during the last<br/>few hours have not been kept separate from the rest, but their<br/>general character can be gathered from what we have in Alexey<br/>Fyodorovitch's manuscript.<br/><br/>The elder's death came in the end quite unexpectedly. For<br/>although those who were gathered about him that last evening<br/>realised that his death was approaching, yet it was difficult to<br/>imagine that it would come so suddenly. On the contrary, his<br/>friends, as I observed already, seeing him that night apparently so<br/>cheerful and talkative, were convinced that there was at least a<br/>temporary change for the better in his condition. Even five minutes<br/>before his death, they said afterwards wonderingly, it was<br/>impossible to foresee it. He seemed suddenly to feel an acute pain<br/>in his chest, he turned pale and pressed his hands to his heart.<br/>All rose from their seats and hastened to him. But though<br/>suffering, he still looked at them with a smile, sank slowly from<br/>his chair on to his knees, then bowed his face to the ground,<br/>stretched out his arms and as though in joyful ecstasy, praying and<br/>kissing the ground, quietly and joyfully gave up his soul to<br/>God.<br/>
