<br/>"Yes. I can give up their bread, not needing it at all, and go<br/>away into the forest and live there on the mushrooms or the<br/>berries, but they can't give up their bread here, wherefore they<br/>are in bondage to the devil. Nowadays the unclean deny that there<br/>is need of such fasting. Haughty and unclean is their<br/>judgment."<br/><br/>"Och, true," sighed the monk.<br/><br/>"And have you seen devils among them?" asked Ferapont.<br/><br/>"Among them? Among whom?" asked the monk, timidly.<br/><br/>"I went to the Father Superior on Trinity Sunday last year, I<br/>haven't been since. I saw a devil sitting on one man's chest hiding<br/>under his cassock, only his horns poked out; another had one<br/>peeping out of his pocket with such sharp eyes, he was afraid of<br/>me; another settled in the unclean belly of one, another was<br/>hanging round a man's neck, and so he was carrying him about<br/>without seeing him."<br/><br/>"You- can see spirits?" the monk inquired.<br/><br/>"I tell you I can see, I can see through them. When I was coming<br/>out from the Superior's I saw one hiding from me behind the door,<br/>and a big one, a yard and a half or more high, with a thick long<br/>grey tail, and the tip of his tail was in the crack of the door and<br/>I was quick and slammed the door, pinching his tail in it. He<br/>squealed and began to struggle, and I made the sign of the cross<br/>over him three times. And he died on the spot like a crushed<br/>spider. He must have rotted there in the corner and be stinking,<br/>but they don't see, they don't smell it. It's a year since I have<br/>been there. I reveal it to you, as you are a stranger."<br/><br/>"Your words are terrible! But, holy and blessed father," said<br/>the monk, growing bolder and bolder, "is it true, as they noise<br/>abroad even to distant lands about you, that you are in continual<br/>communication with the Holy Ghost?"<br/><br/>"He does fly down at times."<br/><br/>"How does he fly down? In what form?"<br/><br/>
