<br/>"And I never saw such a charming fellow as this nice boy," said<br/>the grateful lady, pointing to Krassotkin.<br/><br/>"And I'll bring you as much powder as you like, Ilusha. We make<br/>the powder ourselves now. Borovikov found out how it's made-<br/>twenty-four parts of saltpetre, ten of sulphur and six of birchwood<br/>charcoal. It's all pounded together, mixed into a paste with water<br/>and rubbed through a tammy sieve-that's how it's done."<br/><br/>"Smurov told me about your powder, only father says it's not<br/>real gunpowder," responded Ilusha.<br/><br/>"Not real?" Kolya flushed. "It burns. I don't know, of<br/>course."<br/><br/>"No, I didn't mean that," put in the captain with a guilty face.<br/>"I only said that real powder is not made like that, but that's<br/>nothing, it can be made so."<br/><br/>"I don't know, you know best. We lighted some in a pomatum pot,<br/>it burned splendidly, it all burnt away leaving only a tiny ash.<br/>But that was only the paste, and if you rub it through… but of<br/>course you know best, I don't know… And Bulkin's father thrashed<br/>him on account of our powder, did you hear?" he turned to<br/>Ilusha.<br/><br/>"We had prepared a whole bottle of it and he used to keep it<br/>under his bed. His father saw it. He said it might explode, and<br/>thrashed him on the spot. He was going to make a complaint against<br/>me to the masters. He is not allowed to go about with me now, no<br/>one is allowed to go about with me now. Smurov is not allowed to<br/>either; I've got a bad name with everyone. They say I'm a<br/>'desperate character,'" Kolya smiled scornfully. "It all began from<br/>what happened on the railway."<br/><br/>"Ah, we've heard of that exploit of yours, too," cried the<br/>captain. "How could you lie still on the line? Is it possible you<br/>weren't the least afraid, lying there under the train? Weren't you<br/>frightened?"<br/><br/>The captain was abject in his flattery of Kolya.<br/><br/>"N- not particularly," answered Kolya carelessly. "What's<br/>blasted my reputation more than anything here was that cursed<br/>goose," he said, turning again to Ilusha- but though he assumed an<br/>unconcerned air as he talked, he still could not control himself<br/>and was continually missing the note he tried to keep up.<br/><br/>
