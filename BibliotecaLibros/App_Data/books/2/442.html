<br/>"Nothing will make him get up, nothing!" Kolya cried<br/>triumphantly, proud of his success. "He won't move for all the<br/>shouting in the world, but if I call to him, he'll jump up in a<br/>minute. Ici, Perezvon!" The dog leapt up and bounded about, whining<br/>with delight. The captain ran back with a piece of cooked beef.<br/><br/>"Is it hot?" Kolya inquired hurriedly, with a business-like air,<br/>taking the meat. "Dogs don't like hot things. No, it's all right.<br/>Look, everybody, look, Ilusha, look, old man; why aren't you<br/>looking? He does not look at him, now I've brought him."<br/><br/>The new trick consisted in making the dog stand motionless with<br/>his nose out and putting a tempting morsel of meat just on his<br/>nose. The luckless dog had to stand without moving, with the meat<br/>on his nose, as long as his master chose to keep him, without a<br/>movement, perhaps for half an hour. But he kept Perezvon only for a<br/>brief moment.<br/><br/>"Paid for!" cried Kolya, and the meat passed in a flash from the<br/>dog's nose to his mouth. The audience, of course, expressed<br/>enthusiasm and surprise.<br/><br/>"Can you really have put off coming all this time simply to<br/>train the dog?" exclaimed Alyosha, with an involuntary note of<br/>reproach in his voice.<br/><br/>"Simply for that!" answered Kolya, with perfect simplicity. "I<br/>wanted to show him in all his glory."<br/><br/>"Perezvon! Perezvon," called Ilusha suddenly, snapping his thin<br/>fingers and beckoning to the dog.<br/><br/>"What is it? Let him jump up on the bed! Ici, Perezvon!" Kolya<br/>slapped the bed and Perezvon darted up by Ilusha. The boy threw<br/>both arms round his head and Perezvon instantly licked his cheek.<br/>Ilusha crept close to him, stretched himself out in bed and hid his<br/>face in the dog's shaggy coat.<br/><br/>"Dear, dear!" kept exclaiming the captain. Kolya sat down again<br/>on the edge of the bed.<br/><br/>"Ilusha, I can show you another trick. I've brought you a little<br/>cannon. You remember, I told you about it before and you said how<br/>much you'd like to see it. Well, here, I've brought it to you."<br/><br/>
