<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>1<br/>Fyodor Pavlovitch Karamazov<br/><br/><br/>ALEXEY Fyodorovitch Karamazov was the third son of Fyodor<br/>Pavlovitch Karamazov, a landowner well known in our district in his<br/>own day, and still remembered among us owing to his gloomy and<br/>tragic death, which happened thirteen years ago, and which I shall<br/>describe in its proper place. For the present I will only say that<br/>this "landowner"- for so we used to call him, although he hardly<br/>spent a day of his life on his own estate- was a strange type, yet<br/>one pretty frequently to be met with, a type abject and vicious and<br/>at the same time senseless. But he was one of those senseless<br/>persons who are very well capable of looking after their worldly<br/>affairs, and, apparently, after nothing else. Fyodor Pavlovitch,<br/>for instance, began with next to nothing; his estate was of the<br/>smallest; he ran to dine at other men's tables, and fastened on<br/>them as a toady, yet at his death it appeared that he had a hundred<br/>thousand roubles in hard cash. At the same time, he was all his<br/>life one of the most senseless, fantastical fellows in the whole<br/>district. I repeat, it was not stupidity- the majority of these<br/>fantastical fellows are shrewd and intelligent enough- but just<br/>senselessness, and a peculiar national form of it.<br/><br/>He was married twice, and had three sons, the eldest, Dmitri, by<br/>his first wife, and two, Ivan and Alexey, by his second. Fyodor<br/>Pavlovitch's first wife, Adelaida Ivanovna, belonged to a fairly<br/>rich and distinguished noble family, also landowners in our<br/>district, the Miusovs. How it came to pass that an heiress, who was<br/>also a beauty, and moreover one of those vigorous intelligent<br/>girls, so common in this generation, but sometimes also to be found<br/>in the last, could have married such a worthless, puny weakling, as<br/>we all called him, I won't attempt to explain. I knew a young lady<br/>of the last "romantic" generation who after some years of an<br/>enigmatic passion for a gentleman, whom she might quite easily have<br/>married at any moment, invented insuperable obstacles to their<br/>union, and ended by throwing herself one stormy night into a rather<br/>deep and rapid river from a high bank, almost a precipice, and so<br/>perished, entirely to satisfy her own caprice, and to be like<br/>Shakespeare's Ophelia. Indeed, if this precipice, a chosen and<br/>favourite spot of hers, had been less picturesque, if there had<br/>been a prosaic flat bank in its place, most likely the suicide<br/>would never have taken place. This is a fact, and probably there<br/>have been not a few similar instances in the last two or three<br/>generations. Adelaida Ivanovna Miusov's action was similarly, no<br/>doubt, an echo of other people's ideas, and was due to the<br/>irritation caused by lack of mental freedom. She wanted, perhaps,<br/>to show her feminine independence, to override class distinctions<br/>and the despotism of her family. And a pliable imagination<br/>persuaded her, we must suppose, for a brief moment, that Fyodor<br/>Pavlovitch, in spite of his parasitic position, was one of the bold<br/>and ironical spirits of that progressive epoch, though he was, in<br/>fact, an ill-natured buffoon and nothing more. What gave the<br/>marriage piquancy was that it was preceded by an elopement, and<br/>this greatly captivated Adelaida Ivanovna's fancy. Fyodor<br/>Pavlovitch's position at the time made him specially eager for any<br/>such enterprise, for he was passionately anxious to make a career<br/>in one way or another. To attach himself to a good family and<br/>obtain a dowry was an alluring prospect. As for mutual love it did<br/>not exist apparently, either in the bride or in him, in spite of<br/>Adelaida Ivanovna's beauty. This was, perhaps, a unique case of the<br/>kind in the life of Fyodor Pavlovitch, who was always of a<br/>voluptuous temper, and ready to run after any petticoat on the<br/>slightest encouragement. She seems to have been the only woman who<br/>made no particular appeal to his senses.<br/><br/>Immediately after the elopement Adelaida Ivanovna discerned in a<br/>flash that she had no feeling for her husband but contempt. The<br/>marriage accordingly showed itself in its true colours with<br/>extraordinary rapidity. Although the family accepted the event<br/>pretty quickly and apportioned the runaway bride her dowry, the<br/>husband and wife began to lead a most disorderly life, and there<br/>were everlasting scenes between them. It was said that the young<br/>wife showed incomparably more generosity and dignity than Fyodor<br/>Pavlovitch, who, as is now known, got hold of all her money up to<br/>twenty five thousand roubles as soon as she received it, so that<br/>those thousands were lost to her forever. The little village and<br/>the rather fine town house which formed part of her dowry he did<br/>his utmost for a long time to transfer to his name, by means of<br/>some deed of conveyance. He would probably have succeeded, merely<br/>from her moral fatigue and desire to get rid of him, and from the<br/>contempt and loathing he aroused by his persistent and shameless<br/>importunity. But, fortunately, Adelaida Ivanovna's family<br/>intervened and circumvented his greediness. It is known for a fact<br/>that frequent fights took place between the husband and wife, but<br/>rumour had it that Fyodor Pavlovitch did not beat his wife but was<br/>beaten by her, for she was a hot-tempered, bold, dark-browed,<br/>impatient woman, possessed of remarkable physical strength.<br/>Finally, she left the house and ran away from Fyodor Pavlovitch<br/>with a destitute divinity student, leaving Mitya, a child of three<br/>years old, in her husband's hands. Immediately Fyodor Pavlovitch<br/>introduced a regular harem into the house, and abandoned himself to<br/>orgies of drunkenness. In the intervals he used to drive all over<br/>the province, complaining tearfully to each and all of Adelaida<br/>Ivanovna's having left him, going into details too disgraceful for<br/>a husband to mention in regard to his own married life. What seemed<br/>to gratify him and flatter his self-love most was to play the<br/>ridiculous part of the injured husband, and to parade his woes with<br/>embellishments.<br/><br/>"One would think that you'd got a promotion, Fyodor Pavlovitch,<br/>you seem so pleased in spite of your sorrow," scoffers said to him.<br/>Many even added that he was glad of a new comic part in which to<br/>play the buffoon, and that it was simply to make it funnier that he<br/>pretended to be unaware of his ludicrous position. But, who knows,<br/>it may have been simplicity. At last he succeeded in getting on the<br/>track of his runaway wife. The poor woman turned out to be in<br/>Petersburg, where she had gone with her divinity student, and where<br/>she had thrown herself into a life of complete emancipation. Fyodor<br/>Pavlovitch at once began bustling about, making preparations to go<br/>to Petersburg, with what object he could not himself have said. He<br/>would perhaps have really gone; but having determined to do so he<br/>felt at once entitled to fortify himself for the journey by another<br/>bout of reckless drinking. And just at that time his wife's family<br/>received the news of her death in Petersburg. She had died quite<br/>suddenly in a garret, according to one story, of typhus, or as<br/>another version had it, of starvation. Fyodor Pavlovitch was drunk<br/>when he heard of his wife's death, and the story is that he ran out<br/>into the street and began shouting with joy, raising his hands to<br/>Heaven: "Lord, now lettest Thou Thy servant depart in peace," but<br/>others say he wept without restraint like a little child, so much<br/>so that people were sorry for him, in spite of the repulsion he<br/>inspired. It is quite possible that both versions were true, that<br/>he rejoiced at his release, and at the same time wept for her who<br/>released him. As a general rule, people, even the wicked, are much<br/>more naive and simple-hearted than we suppose. And we ourselves<br/>are, too.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
