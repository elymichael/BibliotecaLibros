"So you'll hit a man from behind! They tell the truth, then,
when they say that you attack on the sly," said Alyosha, turning
round again. This time the boy threw a stone savagely right into
Alyosha's face; but Alyosha just had time to guard himself, and the
stone struck him on the elbow.

"Aren't you ashamed? What have I done to you?" he cried.

The boy waited in silent defiance, certain that now Alyosha
would attack him. Seeing that even now he would not, his rage was
like a little wild beast's; he flew at Alyosha himself, and before
Alyosha had time to move, the spiteful child had seized his left
hand with both of his and bit his middle finger. He fixed his teeth
in it and it was ten seconds before he let go. Alyosha cried out
with pain and pulled his finger away with all his might. The child
let go at last and retreated to his former distance. Alyosha's
finger had been badly bitten to the bone, close to the nail; it
began to bleed. Alyosha took out his handkerchief and bound it
tightly round his injured hand. He was a full minute bandaging it.
The boy stood waiting all the time. At last Alyosha raised his
gentle eyes and looked at him.

"Very well," he said, "You see how badly you've bitten me.
That's enough, isn't it? Now tell me, what have I done to you?"

The boy stared in amazement.

"Though I don't know you and it's the first time I've seen you,"
Alyosha went on with the same serenity, "yet I must have done
something to you- you wouldn't have hurt me like this for nothing.
So what have I done? How have I wronged you, tell me?"

Instead of answering, the boy broke into a loud tearful wail and
ran away. Alyosha walked slowly after him towards Mihailovsky
Street, and for a long time he saw the child running in the
distance as fast as ever, not turning his head and no doubt still
keeping up his tearful wail. He made up his mind to find him out as
soon as he had time, and to solve this mystery. just now he had not
the time.
