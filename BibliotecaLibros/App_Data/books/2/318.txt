"But what for? What for?"

"For my education. People can thrash a man for anything,"
Maximov concluded, briefly and sententiously.

"Eh, that's enough! That's all stupid, I don't want to listen. I
thought it would be amusing," Grushenka cut them short,
suddenly.

Mitya started, and at once left off laughing. The tall Pole rose
upon his feet, and with the haughty air of a man, bored and out of
his element, began pacing from corner to corner of the room, his
hands behind his back.

"Ah, he can't sit still," said Grushenka, looking at him
contemptuously. Mitya began to feel anxious. He noticed besides,
that the Pole on the sofa was looking at him with an irritable
expression.

"Panie!" cried Mitya, "Let's drink! and the other pan, too! Let
us drink."

In a flash he had pulled three glasses towards him, and filled
them with champagne.

"To Poland, Panovie, I drink to your Poland!" cried Mitya.

"I shall be delighted, panie," said the Pole on the sofa, with
dignity and affable condescension, and he took his glass.

"And the other pan, what's his name? Drink, most illustrious,
take your glass!" Mitya urged.

"Pan Vrublevsky," put in the Pole on the sofa.
