<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>6<br/>Precocity<br/><br/><br/>"WHAT do you think the doctor will say to him?" Kolya asked<br/>quickly. "What a repulsive mug, though, hasn't he? I can't endure<br/>medicine!"<br/><br/>"Ilusha is dying. I think that's certain," answered Alyosha,<br/>mournfully.<br/><br/>"They are rogues! Medicine's a fraud! I am glad to have made<br/>your acquaintance, though, Karamazov. I wanted to know you for a<br/>long time. I am only sorry we meet in such sad circumstances."<br/><br/>Kolya had a great inclination to say something even warmer and<br/>more demonstrative, but he felt ill at ease. Alyosha noticed this,<br/>smiled, and pressed his hand.<br/><br/>"I've long learned to respect you as a rare person," Kolya<br/>muttered again, faltering and uncertain. "I have heard you are a<br/>mystic and have been in the monastery. I know you are a mystic,<br/>but… that hasn't put me off. Contact with real life will cure you…<br/>. It's always so with characters like yours."<br/><br/>"What do you mean by mystic? Cure me of what?" Alyosha was<br/>rather astonished.<br/><br/>"Oh, God and all the rest of it."<br/>
