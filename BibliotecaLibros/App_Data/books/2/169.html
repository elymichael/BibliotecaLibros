<br/>"If you'd been a cadet in the army, or a young hussar, you<br/>wouldn't have talked like that, but would have drawn your sabre to<br/>defend all Russia."<br/><br/>"I don't want to be a hussar, Marya Kondratyevna, and, what's<br/>more, I should like to abolish all soldiers."<br/><br/>"And when an enemy comes, who is going to defend us?"<br/><br/>"There's no need of defence. In 1812 there was a great invasion<br/>of Russia by Napoleon, first Emperor of the French, father of the<br/>present one, and it would have been a good thing if they had<br/>conquered us. A clever nation would have conquered a very stupid<br/>one and annexed it. We should have had quite different<br/>institutions."<br/><br/>"Are they so much better in their own country than we are? I<br/>wouldn't change a dandy I know of for three young englishmen,"<br/>observed Marya Kondratyevna tenderly, doubtless accompanying her<br/>words with a most languishing glance.<br/><br/>"That's as one prefers."<br/><br/>"But you are just like a foreigner- just like a most gentlemanly<br/>foreigner. I tell you that, though it makes me bashful."<br/><br/>"If you care to know, the folks there and ours here are just<br/>alike in their vice. They are swindlers, only there the scoundrel<br/>wears polished boots and here he grovels in filth and sees no harm<br/>in it. The Russian people want thrashing, as Fyodor Pavlovitch said<br/>very truly yesterday, though he is mad, and all his children."<br/><br/>"You said yourself you had such a respect for Ivan<br/>Fyodorovitch."<br/><br/>"But he said I was a stinking lackey. He thinks that I might be<br/>unruly. He is mistaken there. If I had a certain sum in my pocket,<br/>I would have left here long ago. Dmitri Fyodorovitch is lower than<br/>any lackey in his behaviour, in his mind, and in his poverty. He<br/>doesn't know how to do anything, and yet he is respected by<br/>everyone. I may be only a soup-maker, but with luck I could open a<br/>cafe restaurant in Petrovka, in Moscow, for my cookery is something<br/>special, and there's no one in Moscow, except the foreigners, whose<br/>cookery is anything special. Dmitri Fyodorovitch is a beggar, but<br/>if he were to challenge the son of the first count in the country,<br/>he'd fight him. Though in what way is he better than I am? For he<br/>is ever so much stupider than I am. Look at the money he has wasted<br/>without any need!"<br/><br/>
