And Kolya hurriedly pulled out of his satchel the little bronze<br/>cannon. He hurried, because he was happy himself. Another time he<br/>would have waited till the sensation made by Perezvon had passed<br/>off, now he hurried on, regardless of all consideration. "You are<br/>all happy now," he felt, "so here's something to make you happier!"<br/>He was perfectly enchanted himself.<br/><br/>"I've been coveting this thing for a long while; it's for you,<br/>old man, it's for you. It belonged to Morozov, it was no use to<br/>him, he had it from his brother. I swopped a book from father's<br/>book-case for it, A Kinsman of Mahomet, or Salutary Folly, a<br/>scandalous book published in Moscow a hundred years ago, before<br/>they had any censorship. And Morozov has a taste for such things.<br/>He was grateful to me, tooâ€¦ ."<br/><br/>Kolya held the cannon in his hand so that all could see and<br/>admire it. Ilusha raised himself, and, with his right arm still<br/>round the dog, he gazed enchanted at the toy. The sensation was<br/>even greater when Kolya announced that he had gunpowder too, and<br/>that it could be fired off at once "if it won't alarm the ladies."<br/>"Mamma" immediately asked to look at the toy closer and her request<br/>was granted. She was much pleased with the little bronze cannon on<br/>wheels and began rolling it to and fro on her lap. She readily gave<br/>permission for the cannon to be fired, without any idea of what she<br/>had been asked. Kolya showed the powder and the shot. The captain,<br/>as a military man, undertook to load it, putting in a minute<br/>quantity of powder. He asked that the shot might be put off till<br/>another time. The cannon was put on the floor, aiming towards an<br/>empty part of the room, three grains of powder were thrust into the<br/>touchhole and a match was put to it. A magnificent explosion<br/>followed. Mamma was startled, but at once laughed with delight. The<br/>boys gazed in speechless triumph. But the captain, looking at<br/>Ilusha, was more enchanted than any of them. Kolya picked up the<br/>cannon and immediately presented it to Ilusha, together with the<br/>powder and the shot.<br/><br/>"I got it for you, for you! I've been keeping it for you a long<br/>time," he repeated once more in his delight.<br/><br/>"Oh, give it to me! No, give me the cannon!" mamma began begging<br/>like a little child. Her face showed a piteous fear that she would<br/>not get it. Kolya was disconcerted. The captain fidgeted<br/>uneasily.<br/><br/>"Mamma, mamma," he ran to her, "the cannon's yours, of course,<br/>but let Ilusha have it, because it's a present to him, but it's<br/>just as good as yours. Ilusha will always let you play with it; it<br/>shall belong to both of you, both of you."<br/><br/>"No, I don't want it to belong to both of us; I want it to be<br/>mine altogether, not Ilusha's," persisted mamma, on the point of<br/>tears.<br/><br/>"Take it, mother, here, keep it!" Ilusha cried. "Krassotkin, may<br/>I give it to my mother?" he turned to Krassotkin with an imploring<br/>face, as though he were afraid he might be offended at his giving<br/>his present to someone else.<br/><br/>"Of course you may," Krassotkin assented heartily, and, taking<br/>the cannon from Ilusha, he handed it himself to mamma with a polite<br/>bow. She was so touched that she cried.<br/><br/>"Ilusha, darling, he's the one who loves his mammal" she said<br/>tenderly, and at once began wheeling the cannon to and fro on her<br/>lap again.<br/><br/>"Mamma, let me kiss your hand." The captain darted up to her at<br/>once and did so.<br/>
