"Mamma, mamma, my dear, give over! You are not lonely. Everyone
loves you, everyone adores you." He began kissing both her hands
again and tenderly stroking her face; taking the dinner-napkin, he
began wiping away her tears. Alyosha fancied that he too had tears
in his eyes. "There, you see, you hear?" he turned with a sort of
fury to Alyosha, pointing to the poor imbecile.

"I see and hear," muttered Alyosha.

"Father, father, how can you- with him! Let him alone!" cried
the boy, sitting up in his bed and gazing at his father with
glowing eyes.

"Do give over fooling, showing off your silly antics which never
lead to anything! shouted Varvara, stamping her foot with
passion.

"Your anger is quite just this time, Varvara, and I'll make
haste to satisfy you. Come, put on your cap, Alexey Fyodorovitch,
and I'll put on mine. We will go out. I have a word to say to you
in earnest, but not within these walls. This girl sitting here is
my daughter Nina; I forgot to introduce her to you. She is a
heavenly angel incarnate… who has flown down to us mortals,… if you
can understand."

"There he is shaking all over, as though he is in convulsions!"
Varvara went on indignantly.

"And she there stamping her foot at me and calling me a fool
just now, she is a heavenly angel incarnate too, and she has good
reason to call me so. Come along, Alexey Fyodorovitch, we must make
an end."

And, snatching Alyosha's hand, he drew him out of the room into
the street.
