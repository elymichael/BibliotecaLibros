"Mother never does whip us," Nastya observed at once.

"I know, I only said it to finish the sentence. And don't you
ever deceive your mother except just this once, until I come back.
And so, kiddies, can I go out? You won't be frightened and cry when
I'm gone?"

"We sha-all cry," drawled Kostya, on the verge of tears
already.

"We shall cry, we shall be sure to cry," Nastya chimed in with
timid haste.

"Oh, children, children, how fraught with peril are your years!
There's no help for it, chickens; I shall have to stay with you I
don't know how long. And time is passing, time is passing,
oogh!"

"Tell Perezvon to pretend to be dead!" Kostya begged.

"There's no help for it, we must have recourse to Perezvon. Ici,
Perezvon." And Kolya began giving orders to the dog, who performed
all his tricks.

He was a rough-haired dog, of medium size, with a coat of a sort
of lilac-grey colour. He was blind in his right eye, and his left
ear was torn. He whined and jumped, stood and walked on his hind
legs, lay on his back with his paws in the air, rigid as though he
were dead. While this last performance was going on, the door
opened and Agafya, Madame Krassotkin's servant, a stout woman of
forty, marked with small-pox, appeared in the doorway. She had come
back from market and had a bag full of provisions in her hand.
Holding up the bag of provisions in her left hand she stood still
to watch the dog. Though Kolya had been so anxious for her return,
he did not cut short the performance, and after keeping Perezvon
dead for the usual time, at last he whistled to him. The dog jumped
up and began bounding about in his joy at having done his duty.

"Only think, a dog!" Agafya observed sententiously.

"Why are you late, female?" asked Krassotkin sternly.

"Female, indeed! Go on with you, you brat."
