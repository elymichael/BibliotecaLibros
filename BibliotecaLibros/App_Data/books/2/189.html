<br/>"I climb up to the garret every day. I might fall from the<br/>garret again to-morrow. And, if not, I might fall down the cellar<br/>steps. I have to go into the cellar every day, too."<br/><br/>Ivan took a long look at him.<br/><br/>"You are talking nonsense, I see, and I don't quite understand<br/>you," he said softly, but with a sort of menace. "Do you mean to<br/>pretend to be ill to-morrow for three days, eh?"<br/><br/>Smerdyakov, who was looking at the ground again, and playing<br/>with the toe of his right foot, set the foot down, moved the left<br/>one forward, and, grinning, articulated:<br/><br/>"If I were able to play such a trick, that is, pretend to have a<br/>fit- and it would not be difficult for a man accustomed to them- I<br/>should have a perfect right to use such a means to save myself from<br/>death. For even if Agrafena Alexandrovna comes to see his father<br/>while I am ill, his honour can't blame a sick man for not telling<br/>him. He'd be ashamed to."<br/><br/>"Hang it all!" Ivan cried, his face working with anger, "Why are<br/>you always in such a funk for your life? All my brother Dmitri's<br/>threats are only hasty words and mean nothing. He won't kill you;<br/>it's not you he'll kill!"<br/><br/>"He'd kill me first of all, like a fly. But even more than that,<br/>I am afraid I shall be taken for an accomplice of his when he does<br/>something crazy to his father."<br/><br/>"Why should you be taken for an accomplice?"<br/><br/>"They'll think I am an accomplice, because I let him know the<br/>signals as a great secret."<br/><br/>"What signals? Whom did you tell? Confound you, speak more<br/>plainly."<br/><br/>
