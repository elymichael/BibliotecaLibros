"The devil knows. From bravado perhaps… at having wasted so much
money… . To try and forget that money I had sewn up, perhaps… yes,
that was why… damn it… how often will you ask me that question?
Well, I told a fib, and that was the end of it; once I'd said it, I
didn't care to correct it. What does a man tell lies for
sometimes?"

"That's very difficult to decide, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, what
makes a man tell lies," observed the prosecutor impressively. "Tell
me, though, was that 'amulet,' as you call it, on your neck, a big
thing?"

"No, not big."

"How big, for instance?"

"If you fold a hundred-rouble note in half, that would be the
size."

"You'd better show us the remains of it. You must have them
somewhere."

"Damnation, what nonsense! I don't know where they are."

"But excuse me: where and when did you take it off your neck?
According to your own evidence you didn't go home."

"When I was going from Fenya's to Perhotin's, on the way I tore
it off my neck and took out the money."

"In the dark?"

"What should I want a light for? I did it with my fingers in one
minute."
