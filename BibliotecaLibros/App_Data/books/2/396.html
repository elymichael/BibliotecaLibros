"May I look out of window?" he asked Nikolay Parfenovitch,<br/>suddenly.<br/><br/>"Oh, as much as you like," the latter replied.<br/><br/>Mitya got up and went to the window… . The rain lashed against<br/>its little greenish panes. He could see the muddy road just below<br/>the house, and farther away, in the rain and mist, a row of poor,<br/>black, dismal huts, looking even blacker and poorer in the rain.<br/>Mitya thought of "Phoebus the golden-haired, and how he had meant<br/>to shoot himself at his first ray. "Perhaps it would be even better<br/>on a morning like this," he thought with a smile, and suddenly,<br/>flinging his hand downwards, he turned to his "torturers."<br/><br/>"Gentlemen," he cried, "I see that I am lost! But she? Tell me<br/>about her, I beseech you. Surely she need not be ruined with me?<br/>She's innocent, you know, she was out of her mind when she cried<br/>last night 'It's all my fault!' She's done nothing, nothing! I've<br/>been grieving over her all night as I sat with you… . Can't you,<br/>won't you tell me what you are going to do with her now?"<br/><br/>"You can set your mind quite at rest on that score, Dmitri<br/>Fyodorovitch," the prosecutor answered at once, with evident<br/>alacrity. "We have, so far, no grounds for interfering with the<br/>lady in whom you are so interested. I trust that it may be the same<br/>in the later development of the case… . On the contrary, we'll do<br/>everything that lies in our power in that matter. Set your mind<br/>completely at rest."<br/><br/>"Gentlemen, I thank you. I knew that you were honest,<br/>straightforward people in spite of everything. You've taken a load<br/>off my heart… . Well, what are we to do now? I'm ready."<br/><br/>"Well, we ought to make haste. We must pass to examining the<br/>witnesses without delay. That must be done in your presence and<br/>therefore-"<br/><br/>"Shouldn't we have some tea first?" interposed Nikolay<br/>Parfenovitch, "I think we've deserved it!"<br/><br/>They decided that if tea were ready downstairs (Mihail<br/>Makarovitch had, no doubt, gone down to get some) they would have a<br/>glass and then "go on and on," putting off their proper breakfast<br/>until a more favourable opportunity. Tea really was ready below,<br/>and was soon brought up. Mitya at first refused the glass that<br/>Nikolay Parfenovitch politely offered him, but afterwards he asked<br/>for it himself and drank it greedily. He looked surprisingly<br/>exhausted. It might have been supposed from his Herculean strength<br/>that one night of carousing, even accompanied by the most violent<br/>emotions, could have had little effect on him. But he felt that he<br/>could hardly hold his head up, and from time to time all the<br/>objects about him seemed heaving and dancing before his eyes. "A<br/>little more and I shall begin raving," he said to himself.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
