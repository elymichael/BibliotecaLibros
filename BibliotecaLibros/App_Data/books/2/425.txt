"Only don't tease them, please, or you'll get into another
scrape as you did about that goose."

"So you're afraid?"

"Don't laugh, Kolya. Of course I'm afraid. My father would be
awfully cross. I am strictly forbidden to go out with you."

"Don't be uneasy, nothing will happen this time. Hallo,
Natasha!" he shouted to a market woman in one of the booths.

"Call me Natasha! What next! My name is Marya," the middle-aged
marketwoman shouted at him.

"I am so glad it's Marya. Good-bye!"

"Ah, you young rascal! A brat like you to carry on so!"

"I'm in a hurry. I can't stay now. You shall tell me next
Sunday." Kolya waved his hand at her, as though she had attacked
him and not he her.

"I've nothing to tell you next Sunday. You set upon me, you
impudent young monkey. I didn't say anything," bawled Marya. "You
want a whipping, that's what you want, you saucy jackanapes!"

There was a roar of laughter among the other market women round
her. Suddenly a man in a violent rage darted out from the arcade of
shops close by. He was a young man, not a native of the town, with
dark, curly hair and a long, pale face, marked with smallpox. He
wore a long blue coat and a peaked cap, and looked like a
merchant's clerk. He was in a state of stupid excitement and
brandished his fist at Kolya.

"I know you!" he cried angrily, "I know you!"
