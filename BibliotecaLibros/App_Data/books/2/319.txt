Pan Vrublevsky came up to the table, swaying as he walked.

"To Poland, Panovie!" cried Mitya, raisin, his glass.
"Hurrah!"

All three drank. Mitya seized the bottle and again poured out
three glasses.

"Now to Russia, Panovie, and let us be brothers!"

"Pour out some for us," said Grushenka; "I'll drink to Russia,
too!"

"So will I," said Kalganov.

"And I would, tooâ€¦ to Russia, the old grandmother!" tittered
Maximov.

"All! All!" cried Mitya. "Trifon Borissovitch, some more
bottles!"

The other three bottles Mitya had brought with him were put on
the table. Mitya filled the glasses.

"To Russia! Hurrah!" he shouted again. All drank the toast
except the Poles, and Grushenka tossed off her whole glass at once.
The Poles did not touch theirs.
