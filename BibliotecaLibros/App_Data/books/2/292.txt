"Don't dare to do such a thing!" cried Pyotr Ilyitch. "I won't
have it in my house, it's a bad, demoralising habit. Put your money
away. Here, put it here, why waste it? It would come in handy
to-morrow, and I dare say you'll be coming to me to borrow ten
roubles again. Why do you keep putting the notes in your side
pocket? Ah, you'll lose them!"

"I say, my dear fellow, let's go to Mokroe together."

"What should I go for?"

"I say, let's open a bottle at once, and drink to life! I want
to drink, and especially to drink with you. I've never drunk with
you, have I?"

"Very well, we can go to the Metropolis. I was just going
there."

"I haven't time for that. Let's drink at the Plotnikovs', in the
back room. Shall I ask you a riddle?"

"Ask away."

Mitya took the piece of paper out of his waistcoat pocket,
unfolded it and showed it. In a large, distinct hand was written:
"I punish myself for my whole life; my whole life I punish!"

"I will certainly speak to someone. I'll go at once," said Pyotr
Ilyitch, after reading the paper.

"You won't have time, dear boy, come and have a drink.
March!"

Plotnikov's shop was at the corner of the street, next door but
one to Pyotr Ilyitch's. It was the largest grocery shop in our
town, and by no means a bad one, belonging to some rich merchants.
They kept everything that could be got in a Petersburg shop,
grocery of all sort, wines "bottled by the brothers Eliseyev,"
fruits, cigars, tea, coffee, sugar, and so on. There were three
shop-assistants and two errand boys always employed. Though our
part of the country had grown poorer, the landowners had gone away,
and trade had got worse, yet the grocery stores flourished as
before, every year with increasing prosperity; there were plenty of
purchasers for their goods.
