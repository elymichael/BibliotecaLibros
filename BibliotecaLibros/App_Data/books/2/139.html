<br/>"Never mind my being witty, but I must say you show nice feeling<br/>for Alexey Fyodorovitch's sufferings! Oh, my dear Alexey<br/>Fyodorovitch, what's killing me is no one thing in particular, not<br/>Herzenstube, but everything together, that's what is too much for<br/>me."<br/><br/>"That's enough, mamma, enough about Herzenstube," Lise laughed<br/>gaily. "Make haste with the lint and the lotion, mamma. That's<br/>simply Goulard's water, Alexey Fyodorovitch, I remember the name<br/>now, but it's a splendid lotion. Would you believe it, Mamma, on<br/>the way here he had a fight with the boys in the street, and it was<br/>a boy bit his finger, isn't he a child, a child himself? Is he fit<br/>to be married after that? For only fancy, he wants to be married,<br/>mamma. Just think of him married, wouldn't it be funny, wouldn't it<br/>be awful?"<br/><br/>And Lise kept laughing her thin hysterical giggle, looking slyly<br/>at Alyosha.<br/><br/>"But why married, Lise? What makes you talk of such a thing?<br/>It's quite out of place and perhaps the boy was rabid."<br/><br/>"Why, mamma! As though there were rabid boys!"<br/><br/>"Why not, Lise, as though I had said something stupid! Your boy<br/>might have been bitten by a mad dog and he would become mad and<br/>bite anyone near him. How well she has bandaged it, Alexey<br/>Fyodorovitch! I couldn't have done it. Do you still feel the<br/>pain?"<br/><br/>"It's nothing much now."<br/><br/>"You don't feel afraid of water?" asked Lise.<br/><br/>"Come, that's enough, Lise, perhaps I really was rather too<br/>quick talking of the boy being rabid, and you pounced upon it at<br/>once. Katerina Ivanovna has only just heard that you are here,<br/>Alexey Fyodorovitch, she simply rushed at me, she's dying to see<br/>you, dying!"<br/><br/>"Ach, mamma, go to them yourself. He can't go just now, he is in<br/>too much pain."<br/><br/>
