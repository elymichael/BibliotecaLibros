"Cleverer than you," the peasant answered unexpectedly, with the
same gravity.

"I doubt it," said Kolya, somewhat taken aback.

"It's true, though."

"Perhaps it is."

"It is, brother."

"Good-bye, peasant!"

"Good-bye!"

"There are all sorts of peasants," Kolya observed to Smurov
after a brief silence. "How could I tell I had hit on a clever one?
I am always ready to recognise intelligence in the peasantry."

In the distance the cathedral clock struck half-past eleven. The
boys made haste and they walked as far as Captain Snegiryov's
lodging, a considerable distance, quickly and almost in silence.
Twenty paces from the house Kolya stopped and told Smurov to go on
ahead and ask Karamazov to come out to him.

"One must sniff round a bit first," he observed to Smurov.

"Why ask him to come out?" Smurov protested. "You go in; they
will be awfully glad to see you. What's the sense of making friends
in the frost out here?"
