"Oh no; there are people of deep feeling who have been somehow<br/>crushed. Buffoonery in them is a form of resentful irony against<br/>those to whom they daren't speak the truth, from having been for<br/>years humiliated and intimidated by them. Believe me, Krassotkin,<br/>that sort of buffoonery is sometimes tragic in the extreme. His<br/>whole life now is centred in Ilusha, and if Ilusha dies, he will<br/>either go mad with grief or kill himself. I feel almost certain of<br/>that when I look at him now."<br/><br/>"I understand you, Karamazov. I see you understand human<br/>nature," Kolya added, with feeling.<br/><br/>"And as soon as I saw you with a dog, I thought it was Zhutchka<br/>you were bringing."<br/><br/>"Wait a bit, Karamazov, perhaps we shall find it yet; but this<br/>is Perezvon. I'll let him go in now and perhaps it will amuse<br/>Ilusha more than the mastiff pup. Wait a bit, Karamazov, you will<br/>know something in a minute. But, I say, I am keeping you here!"<br/>Kolya cried suddenly. "You've no overcoat on in this bitter cold.<br/>You see what an egoist I am. Oh, we are all egoists,<br/>Karamazov!"<br/><br/>"Don't trouble; it is cold, but I don't often catch cold. Let us<br/>go in, though, and, by the way, what is your name? I know you are<br/>called Kolya, but what else?"<br/><br/>"Nikolay- Nikolay Ivanovitch Krassotkin, or, as they say in<br/>official documents, 'Krassotkin son.'" Kolya laughed for some<br/>reason, but added suddenly, "Of course I hate my name Nikolay."<br/><br/>"Why so?"<br/><br/>"It's so trivial, so ordinary."<br/><br/>"You are thirteen?" asked Alyosha.<br/><br/>"No, fourteen- that is, I shall be fourteen very soon, in a<br/>fortnight. I'll confess one weakness of mine, Karamazov, just to<br/>you, since it's our first meeting, so that you may understand my<br/>character at once. I hate being asked my age, more than that… and<br/>in fact… there's a libellous story going about me, that last week I<br/>played robbers with the preparatory boys. It's a fact that I did<br/>play with them, but it's a perfect libel to say I did it for my own<br/>amusement. I have reasons for believing that you've heard the<br/>story; but I wasn't playing for my own amusement, it was for the<br/>sake of the children, because they couldn't think of anything to do<br/>by themselves. But they've always got some silly tale. This is an<br/>awful town for gossip, I can tell you."<br/><br/>"But what if you had been playing for your own amusement, what's<br/>the harm?"<br/>
