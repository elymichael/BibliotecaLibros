Just answer my question<br/>and I'll go away."<br/><br/>"I've no answer to give you," said Smerdyakov, looking down<br/>again.<br/><br/>"You may be sure I'll make you answer!"<br/><br/>"Why are you so uneasy?" Smerdyakov stared at him, not simply<br/>with contempt, but almost with repulsion. "Is this because the<br/>trial begins to-morrow? Nothing will happen to you; can't you<br/>believe that at last? Go home, go to bed and sleep in peace, don't<br/>be afraid of anything."<br/><br/>"I don't understand youâ€¦ . What have I to be afraid of<br/>to-morrow?" Ivan articulated in astonishment, and suddenly a chill<br/>breath of fear did in fact pass over his soul. Smerdyakov measured<br/>him with his eyes.<br/>
