Mitya turned, and saw that someone had, in fact, parted the
curtains and seemed to be watching them. And not one person alone,
it seemed.

He jumped up and walked quickly to the intruder.

"Here, come to us, come here," said a voice, speaking not
loudly, but firmly and peremptorily.

Mitya passed to the other side of the curtain and stood stock
still. The room was filled with people, but not those who had been
there before. An instantaneous shiver ran down his back, and he
shuddered. He recognised all those people instantly. That tall,
stout old man in the overcoat and forage-cap with a cockade- was
the police captain, Mihail Makarovitch. And that
"consumptive-looking" trim dandy,"who always has such polished
boots"- that was the deputy prosecutor. "He has a chronometer worth
four hundred roubles; he showed it to me." And that small young man
in spectacles… . Mitya forgot his surname though he knew him, had
seen him: he was the "investigating lawyer," from the "school of
jurisprudence," who had only lately come to the town. And this man-
the inspector of police, Mavriky Mavrikyevitch, a man he knew well.
And those fellows with the brass plates on, why are they here? And
those other two… peasants… . And there at the door Kalganov with
Trifon Borissovitch… .

"Gentlemen! What's this for, gentlemen?" began Mitya, but
suddenly, as though beside himself, not knowing what he was doing,
he cried aloud, at the top of his voice:

"I un-der-stand!"

The young man in spectacles moved forward suddenly, and stepping
up to Mitya, began with dignity, though hurriedly:

"We have to make… in brief, I beg you to come this way, this way
to the sofa… . It is absolutely imperative that you should give an
explanation."

"The old man!" cried Mitya frantically. "The old man and his
blood!… I understand."

And he sank, almost fell, on a chair close by, as though he had
been mown down by a scythe.
