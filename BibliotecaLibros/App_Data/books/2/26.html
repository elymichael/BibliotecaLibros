<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>3<br/>Peasant Women Who Have Faith<br/><br/><br/>NEAR the wooden portico below, built on to the outer wall of the<br/>precinct, there was a crowd of about twenty peasant women. They had<br/>been told that the elder was at last coming out, and they had<br/>gathered together in anticipation. Two ladies, Madame Hohlakov and<br/>her daughter, had also come out into the portico to wait for the<br/>elder, but in a separate part of it set aside for women of<br/>rank.<br/><br/>Madame Hohlakov was a wealthy lady, still young and attractive,<br/>and always dressed with taste. She was rather pale, and had lively<br/>black eyes. She was not more than thirty-three, and had been five<br/>years a widow. Her daughter, a girl of fourteen, was partially<br/>paralysed. The poor child had not been able to walk for the last<br/>six months, and was wheeled about in a long reclining chair. She<br/>had a charming little face, rather thin from illness, but full of<br/>gaiety. There was a gleam of mischief in her big dark eyes with<br/>their long lashes. Her mother had been intending to take her abroad<br/>ever since the spring, but they had been detained all the summer by<br/>business connected with their estate. They had been staying a week<br/>in our town, where they had come more for purposes of business than<br/>devotion, but had visited Father Zossima once already, three days<br/>before. Though they knew that the elder scarcely saw anyone, they<br/>had now suddenly turned up again, and urgently entreated "the<br/>happiness of looking once again on the great healer."<br/><br/>The mother was sitting on a chair by the side of her daughter's<br/>invalid carriage, and two paces from her stood an old monk, not one<br/>of our monastery, but a visitor from an obscure religious house in<br/>the far north. He too sought the elder's blessing.<br/><br/>But Father Zossima, on entering the portico, went first straight<br/>to the peasants who were crowded at the foot of the three steps<br/>that led up into the portico. Father Zossima stood on the top step,<br/>put on his stole, and began blessing the women who thronged about<br/>him. One crazy woman was led up to him. As soon as she caught sight<br/>of the elder she began shrieking and writhing as though in the<br/>pains of childbirth. Laying the stole on her forehead, he read a<br/>short prayer over her, and she was at once soothed and quieted.<br/><br/>I do not know how it may be now, but in my childhood I often<br/>happened to see and hear these "possessed" women in the villages<br/>and monasteries. They used to be brought to mass; they would squeal<br/>and bark like a dog so that they were heard all over the church.<br/>But when the sacrament was carried in and they were led up to it,<br/>at once the "possession" ceased, and the sick women were always<br/>soothed for a time. I was greatly impressed and amazed at this as a<br/>child; but then I heard from country neighbours and from my town<br/>teachers that the whole illness was simulated to avoid work, and<br/>that it could always be cured by suitable severity; various<br/>anecdotes were told to confirm this. But later on I learnt with<br/>astonishment from medical specialists that there is no pretence<br/>about it, that it is a terrible illness to which women are subject,<br/>especially prevalent among us in Russia, and that it is due to the<br/>hard lot of the peasant women. It is a disease, I was told, arising<br/>from exhausting toil too soon after hard, abnormal and unassisted<br/>labour in childbirth, and from the hopeless misery, from beatings,<br/>and so on, which some women were not able to endure like others.<br/>The strange and instant healing of the frantic and struggling woman<br/>as soon as she was led up to the holy sacrament, which had been<br/>explained to me as due to malingering and the trickery of the<br/>"clericals," arose probably in the most natural manner. Both the<br/>women who supported her and the invalid herself fully believed as a<br/>truth beyond question that the evil spirit in possession of her<br/>could not hold if the sick woman were brought to the sacrament and<br/>made to bow down before it. And so, with a nervous and psychically<br/>deranged woman, a sort of convulsion of the whole organism always<br/>took place, and was bound to take place, at the moment of bowing<br/>down to the sacrament, aroused by the expectation of the miracle of<br/>healing and the implicit belief that it would come to pass; and it<br/>did come to pass, though only for a moment. It was exactly the same<br/>now as soon as the elder touched the sick woman with the stole.<br/><br/>Many of the women in the crowd were moved to tears of ecstasy by<br/>the effect of the moment: some strove to kiss the hem of his<br/>garment, others cried out in sing-song voices.<br/><br/>He blessed them all and talked with some of them. The<br/>"possessed" woman he knew already. She came from a village only six<br/>versts from the monastery, and had been brought to him before.<br/>
