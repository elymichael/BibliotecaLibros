"I can't behave to her as I ought- break off altogether and tell
her so straight out," said Ivan, irritably. "I must wait till
sentence is passed on the murderer. If I break off with her now,
she will avenge herself on me by ruining that scoundrel to-morrow
at the trial, for she hates him and knows she hates him. It's all a
lie- lie upon lie! As long as I don't break off with her, she goes
on hoping, and she won't ruin that monster, knowing how I want to
get him out of trouble. If only that damned verdict would
come!"

The words "murderer" and "monster" echoed painfully in Alyosha's
heart.

"But how can she ruin Mitya?" he asked, pondering on Ivan's
words. "What evidence can she give that would ruin Mitya?"

"You don't know that yet. She's got a document in her hands, in
Mitya's own writing, that proves conclusively that he did murder
Fyodor Pavlovitch."

"That's impossible!" cried Alyosha.

"Why is it impossible? I've read it myself."

"There can't be such a document!" Alyosha repeated warmly.
"There can't be, because he's not the murderer. It's not he
murdered father, not he!"

Ivan suddenly stopped.

"Who is the murderer then, according to you?" he asked, with
apparent coldness. There was even a supercilious note in his
voice.

"You know who," Alyosha pronounced in a low, penetrating
voice.
