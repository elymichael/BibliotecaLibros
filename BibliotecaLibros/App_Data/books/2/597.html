The boys, seeing that the father would not leave the coffin and<br/>that it was time to carry it out, stood round it in a close circle<br/>and began to lift it up.<br/><br/>"I don't want him to be buried in the churchyard," Snegiryov<br/>wailed suddenly; "I'll bury him by the stone, by our stone! Ilusha<br/>told me to. I won't let him be carried out!" He had been saying for<br/>the last three days that he would bury him by the stone, but<br/>Alyosha, Krassotkin, the landlady, her sister and all the boys<br/>interfered.<br/><br/>"What an idea, bury him by an unholy stone, as though he had<br/>hanged himself!" the old landlady said sternly. "There in the<br/>churchyard the ground has been crossed. He'll be prayed for there.<br/>One can hear the singing in church and the deacon reads so plainly<br/>and verbally that it will reach him every time just as though it<br/>were read over his grave."<br/><br/>At last the captain made a gesture of despair as though to say,<br/>"Take him where you will." The boys raised the coffin, but as they<br/>passed the mother, they stopped for a moment and lowered it that<br/>she might say good-bye to Ilusha. But on seeing that precious<br/>little face, which for the last three days she had only looked at<br/>from a distance, she trembled all over and her grey head began<br/>twitching spasmodically over the coffin.<br/><br/>"Mother, make the sign of the cross over him, give him your<br/>blessing, kiss him," Nina cried to her. But her head still twitched<br/>like an automaton and with a face contorted with bitter grief she<br/>began, without a word, beating her breast with her fist. They<br/>carried the coffin past her. Nina pressed her lips to her brother's<br/>for the last time as they bore the coffin by her. As Alyosha went<br/>out of the house he begged the landlady to look after those who<br/>were left behind, but she interrupted him before he had<br/>finished.<br/><br/>"To be sure, I'll stay with them, we are Christians, too." The<br/>old woman wept as she said it.<br/><br/>They had not far to carry the coffin to the church, not more<br/>than three hundred paces. It was a still, clear day, with a slight<br/>frost. The church bells were still ringing. Snegiryov ran fussing<br/>and distracted after the coffin, in his short old summer overcoat,<br/>with his head bare and his soft, old, wide-brimmed hat in his hand.<br/>He seemed in a state of bewildered anxiety. At one minute he<br/>stretched out his hand to support the head of the coffin and only<br/>hindered the bearers, at another he ran alongside and tried to find<br/>a place for himself there. A flower fell on the snow and he rushed<br/>to pick it up as though everything in the world depended on the<br/>loss of that flower.<br/><br/>"And the crust of bread, we've forgotten the crust!" he cried<br/>suddenly in dismay. But the boys reminded him at once that he had<br/>taken the crust of bread already and that it was in his pocket. He<br/>instantly pulled it out and was reassured.<br/><br/>"Ilusha told me to, Ilusha," he explained at once to Alyosha. "I<br/>was sitting by him one night and he suddenly told me: 'Father, when<br/>my grave is filled up crumble a piece of bread on it so that the<br/>sparrows may fly down; I shall hear and it will cheer me up not to<br/>be lying alone.'"<br/><br/>"That's a good thing," said Alyosha, "we must often take<br/>some."<br/><br/>"Every day, every day!" said the captain quickly, seeming<br/>cheered at the thought.<br/>
