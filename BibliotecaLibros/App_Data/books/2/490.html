<br/>"You've said so to yourself many times, when you've been alone<br/>during these two dreadful months," Alyosha went on softly and<br/>distinctly as before. Yet he was speaking now, as it were, not of<br/>himself, not of his own will, but obeying some irresistible<br/>command. "You have accused yourself and have confessed to yourself<br/>that you are the murderer and no one else. But you didn't do it:<br/>you are mistaken: you are not the murderer. Do you hear? It was not<br/>you! God has sent me to tell you so."<br/><br/>They were both silent. The silence lasted a whole long minute.<br/>They were both standing still, gazing into each other's eyes. They<br/>were both pale. Suddenly Ivan began trembling all over, and<br/>clutched Alyosha's shoulder.<br/><br/>"You've been in my room!" he whispered hoarsely. "You've been<br/>there at night, when he came… . Confess… have you seen him, have<br/>you seen him?"<br/><br/>"Whom do you mean- Mitya?" Alyosha asked, bewildered.<br/><br/>"Not him, damn the monster!" Ivan shouted, in a frenzy, "Do you<br/>know that he visits me? How did you find out? Speak!"<br/><br/>"Who is he? I don't know whom you are talking about," Alyosha<br/>faltered, beginning to be alarmed.<br/><br/>"Yes, you do know. or how could you-&#160;? It's impossible that<br/>you don't know."<br/><br/>Suddenly he seemed to check himself. He stood still and seemed<br/>to reflect. A strange grin contorted his lips.<br/><br/>"Brother," Alyosha began again, in a shaking voice, "I have said<br/>this to you, because you'll believe my word, I know that. I tell<br/>you once and for all, it's not you. You hear, once for all! God has<br/>put it into my heart to say this to you, even though it may make<br/>you hate me from this hour."<br/><br/>But by now Ivan had apparently regained his self-control.<br/><br/>
