<br/>"There's no phantom here, but only us two and one other. No<br/>doubt he is here, that third, between us."<br/><br/>"Who is he? Who is here? What third person?" Ivan cried in<br/>alarm, looking about him, his eyes hastily searching in every<br/>corner.<br/><br/>"That third is God Himself- Providence. He is the third beside<br/>us now. Only don't look for Him, you won't find him."<br/><br/>"It's a lie that you killed him!" Ivan cried madly. "You are<br/>mad, or teasing me again!"<br/><br/>Smerdyakov, as before, watched him curiously, with no sign of<br/>fear. He could still scarcely get over his incredulity; he still<br/>fancied that Ivan knew everything and was trying to "throw it all<br/>on him to his face."<br/><br/>"Wait a minute," he said at last in a weak voice, and suddenly<br/>bringing up his left leg from under the table, he began turning up<br/>his trouser leg. He was wearing long white stockings and slippers.<br/>Slowly he took off his garter and fumbled to the bottom of his<br/>stocking. Ivan gazed at him, and suddenly shuddered in a paroxysm<br/>of terror.<br/><br/>"He's mad!" he cried, and rapidly jumping up, he drew back, so<br/>that he knocked his back against the wall and stood up against it,<br/>stiff and straight. He looked with insane terror at Smerdyakov,<br/>who, entirely unaffected by his terror, continued fumbling in his<br/>stocking, as though he were making an effort to get hold of<br/>something with his fingers and pull it out. At last he got hold of<br/>it and began pulling it out. Ivan saw that it was a piece of paper,<br/>or perhaps a roll of papers. Smerdyakov pulled it out and laid it<br/>on the table.<br/><br/>"Here," he said quietly.<br/><br/>"What is it?" asked Ivan, trembling.<br/><br/>"Kindly look at it," Smerdyakov answered, still in the same low<br/>tone.<br/><br/>
