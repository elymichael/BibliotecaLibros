"He's no money; not a farthing. I'll settle down for the night,<br/>and think things over, and you can go. Perhaps you'll meet herâ€¦ .<br/>Only be sure to come to me to-morrow in the morning. Be sure to. I<br/>have a word to say to you to-morrow. Will you come?"<br/><br/>"When you come, pretend you've come of your own accord to ask<br/>after me. Don't tell anyone I told you to. Don't say a word to<br/>Ivan."<br/><br/>"Very well."<br/><br/>"Good-bye, my angel. You stood up for me, just now. I shall<br/>never forget it. I've a word to say to you to-morrow- but I must<br/>think about it."<br/><br/>"And how do you feel now?"<br/><br/>"I shall get up to-morrow and go out, perfectly well, perfectly<br/>well!"<br/><br/>Crossing the yard Alyosha found Ivan sitting on the bench at the<br/>gateway. He was sitting writing something in pencil in his<br/>notebook. Alyosha told Ivan that their father had waked up, was<br/>conscious, and had let him go back to sleep at the monastery.<br/><br/>"Alyosha, I should be very glad to meet you to-morrow morning,"<br/>said Ivan cordially, standing up. His cordiality was a complete<br/>surprise to Alyosha.<br/><br/>"I shall be at the Hohlakovs' to-morrow," answered Alyosha, "I<br/>may be at Katerina Ivanovna's, too, if I don't find her now."<br/><br/>"But you're going to her now, anyway? For that 'compliments and<br/>farewell,'" said Ivan smiling. Alyosha was disconcerted.<br/><br/>"I think I quite understand his exclamations just now, and part<br/>of what went before. Dmitri has asked you to go to her and say that<br/>he- well, in fact- takes his leave of her?"<br/>
