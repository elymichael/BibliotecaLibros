<br/>"I like to watch such realistic scenes, Smurov," said Kolya<br/>suddenly. "Have you noticed how dogs sniff at one another when they<br/>meet? It seems to be a law of their nature."<br/><br/>"Yes; it's a funny habit."<br/><br/>"No, it's not funny; you are wrong there. There's nothing funny<br/>in nature, however funny it may seem to man with his prejudices. If<br/>dogs could reason and criticise us they'd be sure to find just as<br/>much that would be funny to them, if not far more, in the social<br/>relations of men, their masters- far more, indeed. I repeat that,<br/>because I am convinced that there is far more foolishness among us.<br/>That's Rakitin's idea- a remarkable idea. I am a Socialist,<br/>Smurov."<br/><br/>"And what is a Socialist?" asked Smurov.<br/><br/>"That's when all are equal and all have property in common,<br/>there are no marriages, and everyone has any religion and laws he<br/>likes best, and all the rest of it. You are not old enough to<br/>understand that yet. It's cold, though."<br/><br/>"Yes, twelve degrees of frost. Father looked at the thermometer<br/>just now."<br/><br/>"Have you noticed, Smurov, that in the middle of winter we don't<br/>feel so cold even when there are fifteen or eighteen degrees of<br/>frost as we do now, in the beginning of winter, when there is a<br/>sudden frost of twelve degrees, especially when there is not much<br/>snow. It's because people are not used to it. Everything is habit<br/>with men, everything even in their social and political relations.<br/>Habit is the great motive-power. What a funny-looking peasant!"<br/><br/>Kolya pointed to a tall peasant, with a good-natured countenance<br/>in a long sheepskin coat, who was standing by his wagon, clapping<br/>together his hands, in their shapeless leather gloves, to warm<br/>them. His long fair beard was all white with frost.<br/><br/>"That peasant's beard's frozen," Kolya cried in a loud<br/>provocative voice as he passed him.<br/><br/>"Lots of people's beards are frozen," the peasant replied,<br/>calmly and sententiously.<br/><br/>
