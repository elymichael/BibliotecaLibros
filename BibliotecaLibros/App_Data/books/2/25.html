"What do I care for your faith?" Miusov was on the point of<br/>shouting, but he suddenly checked himself, and said with contempt,<br/>"You defile everything you touch."<br/><br/>The elder suddenly rose from his seat. "Excuse me, gentlemen,<br/>for leaving you a few minutes," he said, addressing all his guests.<br/>"I have visitors awaiting me who arrived before you. But don't you<br/>tell lies all the same," he added, turning to Fyodor Pavlovitch<br/>with a good-humoured face. He went out of the cell. Alyosha and the<br/>novice flew to escort him down the steps. Alyosha was breathless:<br/>he was glad to get away, but he was glad, too, that the elder was<br/>good-humoured and not offended. Father Zossima was going towards<br/>the portico to bless the people waiting for him there. But Fyodor<br/>Pavlovitch persisted, in stopping him at the door of the cell.<br/><br/>"Blessed man!" he cried, with feeling. "Allow me to kiss your<br/>hand once more. Yes, with you I could still talk, I could still get<br/>on. Do you think I always lie and play the fool like this? Believe<br/>me, I have been acting like this all the time on purpose to try<br/>you. I have been testing you all the time to see whether I could<br/>get on with you. Is there room for my humility beside your pride? I<br/>am ready to give you a testimonial that one can get on with you!<br/>But now, I'll be quiet; I will keep quiet all the time. I'll sit in<br/>a chair and hold my tongue. Now it is for you to speak, Pyotr<br/>Alexandrovitch. You are the principal person left now- for ten<br/>minutes."<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
