"Pyotr Alexandrovitch! How could I dare after what's happened!
Forgive me, gentlemen, I was carried away! And upset besides! And,
indeed, I am ashamed. Gentlemen, one man has the heart of Alexander
of Macedon and another the heart of the little dog Fido. Mine is
that of the little dog Fido. I am ashamed! After such an escapade
how can I go to dinner, to gobble up the monastery's sauces? I am
ashamed, I can't. You must excuse me!"

"The devil only knows, what if he deceives us?" thought Miusov,
still hesitating, and watching the retreating buffoon with
distrustful eyes. The latter turned round, and noticing that Miusov
was watching him, waved him a kiss.

"Well, are you coming to the Superior?" Miusov asked Ivan
abruptly.

"Why not? I was especially invited yesterday."

"Unfortunately I feel myself compelled to go to this confounded
dinner," said Miusov with the same irritability, regardless of the
fact that the monk was listening. "We ought, at least, to apologise
for the disturbance, and explain that it was not our doing. What do
you think?"

"Yes, we must explain that it wasn't our doing. Besides, father
won't be there," observed Ivan.

"Well, I should hope not! Confound this dinner!"

They all walked on, however. The monk listened in silence. On
the road through the copse he made one observation however- that
the Father Superior had been waiting a long time, and that they
were more than half an hour late. He received no answer. Miusov
looked with hatred at Ivan.

"Here he is, going to the dinner as though nothing had
happened," he thought. "A brazen face, and the conscience of a
Karamazov!"
