"Take that money away with you," Smerdyakov sighed.<br/><br/>"Of course, I shall take it. But why do you give it to me, if<br/>you committed the murder for the sake of it?" Ivan looked at him<br/>with great surprise.<br/><br/>"I don't want it," Smerdyakov articulated in a shaking voice,<br/>with a gesture of refusal. "I did have an idea of beginning a new<br/>life with that money in Moscow or, better still, abroad. I did<br/>dream of it, chiefly because 'all things are lawful.' That was<br/>quite right what you taught me, for you talked a lot to me about<br/>that. For if there's no everlasting God, there's no such thing as<br/>virtue, and there's no need of it. You were right there. So that's<br/>how I looked at it."<br/><br/>"Did you come to that of yourself?" asked Ivan, with a wry<br/>smile.<br/><br/>"With your guidance."<br/><br/>"And now, I suppose, you believe in God, since you are giving<br/>back the money?"<br/><br/>"No, I don't believe," whispered Smerdyakov.<br/><br/>"Then why are you giving it back?"<br/><br/>"Leave off… that's enough!" Smerdyakov waved his hand again.<br/>"You used to say yourself that everything was lawful, so now why<br/>are you so upset, too? You even want to go and give evidence<br/>against yourself… . Only there'll be nothing of the sort! You won't<br/>go to give evidence," Smerdyakov decided with conviction.<br/><br/>"You'll see," said Ivan.<br/><br/>"It isn't possible. You are very clever. You are fond of money,<br/>I know that. You like to be respected, too, for you're very proud;<br/>you are far too fond of female charms, too, and you mind most of<br/>all about living in undisturbed comfort, without having to depend<br/>on anyone- that's what you care most about. You won't want to spoil<br/>your life for ever by taking such a disgrace on yourself. You are<br/>like Fyodor Pavlovitch, you are more like him than any of his<br/>children; you've the same soul as he had."<br/>
