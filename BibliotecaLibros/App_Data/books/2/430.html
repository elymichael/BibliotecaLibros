<br/>"Nothing could stop me, now I am once off. Hey, good morning,<br/>peasant!"<br/><br/>A sturdy-looking peasant, with a round, simple face and grizzled<br/>beard, who was walking by, raised his head and looked at the boy.<br/>He seemed not quite sober.<br/><br/>"Good morning, if you are not laughing at me," he said<br/>deliberately in reply.<br/><br/>"And if I am?" laughed Kolya.<br/><br/>"Well, a joke's a joke. Laugh away. I don't mind. There's no<br/>harm in a joke."<br/><br/>"I beg your pardon, brother, it was a joke."<br/><br/>"Well, God forgive you!"<br/><br/>"Do you forgive me, too?"<br/><br/>"I quite forgive you. Go along."<br/><br/>"I say, you seem a clever peasant."<br/><br/>
