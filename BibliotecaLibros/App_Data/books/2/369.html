"You're making fun of me, aren't you?" asked Mitya, looking<br/>haughtily at the speaker; but the latter did not flinch.<br/><br/>Mitya turned abruptly, sat astride on his chair, and swung his<br/>arm.<br/><br/>"This was how I struck him! That's how I knocked him down! What<br/>more do you want?"<br/><br/>"Thank you. May I trouble you now to explain why you jumped<br/>down, with what object, and what you had in view?"<br/><br/>"Oh, hang it!… I jumped down to look at the man I'd hurt… I<br/>don't know what for!"<br/><br/>"Though you were so excited and were running away?"<br/><br/>"Yes, though I was excited and running away."<br/><br/>"You wanted to help him?"<br/><br/>"Help!… Yes, perhaps I did want to help him… . I don't<br/>remember."<br/><br/>"You don't remember? Then you didn't quite know what you were<br/>doing?"<br/><br/>"Not at all. I remember everything- every detail. I jumped down<br/>to look at him, and wiped his face with my handkerchief."<br/>
