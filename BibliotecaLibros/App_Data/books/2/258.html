<br/>But all this could only be on condition of the first, the happy<br/>solution of the question. There was another possibility, a<br/>different and awful ending. Suddenly she might say to him: "Go<br/>away. I have just come to terms with Fyodor Pavlovitch. I am going<br/>to marry him and don't want you"- and then… but then… But Mitya did<br/>not know what would happen then. Up to the last hour he didn't<br/>know. That must be said to his credit. He had no definite<br/>intentions, had planned no crime. He was simply watching and spying<br/>in agony, while he prepared himself for the first, happy solution<br/>of his destiny. He drove away any other idea, in fact. But for that<br/>ending a quite different anxiety arose, a new, incidental, but yet<br/>fatal and insoluble difficulty presented itself.<br/><br/>If she were to say to him: "I'm yours; take me away," how could<br/>he take her away? Where had he the means, the money to do it? It<br/>was just at this time that all sources of revenue from Fyodor<br/>Pavlovitch, doles which had gone on without interruption for so<br/>many years, ceased. Grushenka had money, of course, but with regard<br/>to this Mitya suddenly evinced extraordinary pride; he wanted to<br/>carry her away and begin the new life with her himself, at his own<br/>expense, not at hers. He could not conceive of taking her money,<br/>and the very idea caused him a pang of intense repulsion. I won't<br/>enlarge on this fact or analyse it here, but confine myself to<br/>remarking that this was his attitude at the moment. All this may<br/>have arisen indirectly and unconsciously from the secret stings of<br/>his conscience for the money of Katerina Ivanovna that he had<br/>dishonestly appropriated. "I've been a scoundrel to one of them,<br/>and I shall be a scoundrel again to the other directly," was his<br/>feeling then, as he explained after: "and when Grushenka knows, she<br/>won't care for such a scoundrel."<br/><br/>Where then was he to get the means, where was he to get the<br/>fateful money? Without it, all would be lost and nothing could be<br/>done, "and only because I hadn't the money. Oh, the shame of<br/>it!"<br/><br/>To anticipate things: he did, perhaps, know where to get the<br/>money, knew, perhaps, where it lay at that moment. I will say no<br/>more of this here, as it will all be clear later. But his chief<br/>trouble, I must explain however obscurely, lay in the fact that to<br/>have that sum he knew of, to have the right to take it, he must<br/>first restore Katerina Ivanovna's three thousand- if not, "I'm a<br/>common pick-pocket, I'm a scoundrel, and I don't want to begin a<br/>new life as a scoundrel," Mitya decided. And so he made up his mind<br/>to move heaven and earth to return Katerina Ivanovna that three<br/>thousand, and that first of all. The final stage of this decision,<br/>so to say, had been reached only during the last hours, that is,<br/>after his last interview with Alyosha, two days before, on the<br/>high-road, on the evening when Grushenka had insulted Katerina<br/>Ivanovna, and Mitya, after hearing Alyosha's account of it, had<br/>admitted that he was a scoundrel, and told him to tell Katerina<br/>Ivanovna so, if it could be any comfort to her. After parting from<br/>his brother on that night, he had felt in his frenzy that it would<br/>be better "to murder and rob someone than fail to pay my debt to<br/>Katya. I'd rather everyone thought me a robber and a murderer; I'd<br/>rather go to Siberia than that Katya should have the right to say<br/>that I deceived her and stole her money, and used her money to run<br/>away with Grushenka and begin a new life! That I can't do!" So<br/>Mitya decided, grinding his teeth, and he might well fancy at times<br/>that his brain would give way. But meanwhile he went on struggling…<br/>.<br/><br/>Strange to say, though one would have supposed there was nothing<br/>left for him but despair- for what chance had he, with nothing in<br/>the world, to raise such a sum?- yet to the very end he persisted<br/>in hoping that he would get that three thousand, that the money<br/>would somehow come to him of itself, as though it might drop from<br/>heaven. That is just how it is with people who, like Dmitri, have<br/>never had anything to do with money, except to squander what has<br/>come to them by inheritance without any effort of their own, and<br/>have no notion how money is obtained. A whirl of the most fantastic<br/>notions took possession of his brain immediately after he had<br/>parted with Alyosha two days before, and threw his thoughts into a<br/>tangle of confusion. This is how it was he pitched first on a<br/>perfectly wild enterprise. And perhaps to men of that kind in such<br/>circumstances the most impossible, fantastic schemes occur first,<br/>and seem most practical.<br/><br/>He suddenly determined to go to Samsonov, the merchant who was<br/>Grushenka's protector, and to propose a "scheme" to him, and by<br/>means of it to obtain from him at once the whole of the sum<br/>required. Of the commercial value of his scheme he had no doubt,<br/>not the slightest, and was only uncertain how Samsonov would look<br/>upon his freak, supposing he were to consider it from any but the<br/>commercial point of view. Though Mitya knew the merchant by sight,<br/>he was not acquainted with him and had never spoken a word to him.<br/>But for some unknown reason he had long entertained the conviction<br/>that the old reprobate, who was lying at death's door, would<br/>perhaps not at all object now to Grushenka's securing a respectable<br/>position, and marrying a man "to be depended upon." And he believed<br/>not only that he would not object, but that this was what he<br/>desired, and, if opportunity arose, that he would be ready to help.<br/>From some rumour, or perhaps from some stray word of Grushenka's,<br/>he had gathered further that the old man would perhaps prefer him<br/>to Fyodor Pavlovitch for Grushenka.<br/><br/>Possibly many of the readers of my novel will feel that in<br/>reckoning on such assistance, and being ready to take his bride, so<br/>to speak, from the hands of her protector, Dmitri showed great<br/>coarseness and want of delicacy. I will only observe that Mitya<br/>looked upon Grushenka's past as something completely over. He<br/>looked on that past with infinite pity and resolved with all the<br/>fervour of his passion that when once Grushenka told him she loved<br/>him and would marry him, it would mean the beginning of a new<br/>Grushenka and a new Dmitri, free from every vice. They would<br/>forgive one another and would begin their lives afresh. As for<br/>Kuzma Samsonov, Dmitri looked upon him as a man who had exercised a<br/>fateful influence in that remote past of Grushenka's, though she<br/>had never loved him, and who was now himself a thing of the past,<br/>completely done with, and, so to say, non-existent. Besides, Mitya<br/>hardly looked upon him as a man at all, for it was known to<br/>everyone in the town that he was only a shattered wreck, whose<br/>relations with Grushenka had changed their character and were now<br/>simply paternal, and that this had been so for a long time.<br/><br/>In any case there was much simplicity on Mitya's part in all<br/>this, for in spite of all his vices, he was a very simple-hearted<br/>man. It was an instance of this simplicity that Mitya was seriously<br/>persuaded that, being on the eve of his departure for the next<br/>world, old Kuzma must sincerely repent of his past relations with<br/>Grushenka, and that she had no more devoted friend and protector in<br/>the world than this, now harmless, old man.<br/><br/>After his conversation with Alyosha, at the cross-roads, he<br/>hardly slept all night, and at ten o'clock next morning, he was at<br/>the house of Samsonov and telling the servant to announce him. It<br/>was a very large and gloomy old house of two stories, with a lodge<br/>and outhouses. In the lower story lived Samsonov's two married sons<br/>with their families, his old sister, and his unmarried daughter. In<br/>the lodge lived two of his clerks, one of whom also had a large<br/>family. Both the lodge and the lower story were overcrowded, but<br/>the old man kept the upper floor to himself, and would not even let<br/>the daughter live there with him, though she waited upon him, and<br/>in spite of her asthma was obliged at certain fixed hours, and at<br/>any time he might call her, to run upstairs to him from below.<br/><br/>This upper floor contained a number of large rooms kept purely<br/>for show, furnished in the old-fashioned merchant style, with long<br/>monotonous rows of clumsy mahogany chairs along the walls, with<br/>glass chandeliers under shades, and gloomy mirrors on the walls.<br/>All these rooms were entirely empty and unused, for the old man<br/>kept to one room, a small, remote bedroom, where he was waited upon<br/>by an old servant with a kerchief on her head, and by a lad, who<br/>used to sit on the locker in the passage. Owing to his swollen<br/>legs, the old man could hardly walk at all, and was only rarely<br/>lifted from his leather armchair, when the old woman supporting him<br/>led him up and down the room once or twice. He was morose and<br/>taciturn even with this old woman.<br/><br/>
