Pyotr Alexandrovitch could say no more, and was about to leave<br/>the room, overwhelmed with confusion.<br/><br/>"Don't distress yourself, I beg." The elder got on to his feeble<br/>legs, and taking Pyotr Alexandrovitch by both hands, made him sit<br/>down again. "I beg you not to disturb yourself. I particularly beg<br/>you to be my guest." And with a bow he went back and sat down again<br/>on his little sofa.<br/><br/>"Great elder, speak! Do I annoy you by my vivacity?" Fyodor<br/>Pavlovitch cried suddenly, clutching the arms of his chair in both<br/>hands, as though ready to leap up from it if the answer were<br/>unfavourable.<br/><br/>"I earnestly beg you, too, not to disturb yourself, and not to<br/>be uneasy," the elder said impressively. "Do not trouble. Make<br/>yourself quite at home. And, above all, do not be so ashamed of<br/>yourself, for that is at the root of it all."<br/><br/>"Quite at home? To be my natural self? Oh, that is much too<br/>much, but I accept it with grateful joy. Do you know, blessed<br/>father, you'd better not invite me to be my natural self. Don't<br/>risk it… . I will not go so far as that myself. I warn you for your<br/>own sake. Well, the rest is still plunged in the mists of<br/>uncertainty, though there are people who'd be pleased to describe<br/>me for you. I mean that for you, Pyotr Alexandrovitch. But as for<br/>you, holy being, let me tell you, I am brimming over with<br/>ecstasy."<br/><br/>He got up, and throwing up his hands, declaimed, "Blessed be the<br/>womb that bare thee, and the paps that gave thee suck- the paps<br/>especially. When you said just now, 'Don't be so ashamed of<br/>yourself, for that is at the root of it all,' you pierced right<br/>through me by that remark, and read me to the core. Indeed, I<br/>always feel when I meet people that I am lower than all, and that<br/>they all take me for a buffoon. So I say, 'Let me really play the<br/>buffoon. I am not afraid of your opinion, for you are every one of<br/>you worse than I am.' That is why I am a buffoon. It is from shame,<br/>great elder, from shame; it's simply over-sensitiveness that makes<br/>me rowdy. If I had only been sure that everyone would accept me as<br/>the kindest and wisest of men, oh, Lord, what a good man I should<br/>have been then! Teacher!" he fell suddenly on his knees, "what must<br/>I do to gain eternal life?"<br/><br/>It was difficult even now to decide whether he was joking or<br/>really moved.<br/><br/>Father Zossima, lifting his eyes, looked at him, and said with a<br/>smile:<br/><br/>"You have known for a long time what you must do. You have sense<br/>enough: don't give way to drunkenness and incontinence of speech;<br/>don't give way to sensual lust; and, above all, to the love of<br/>money. And close your taverns. If you can't close all, at least two<br/>or three. And, above all- don't lie."<br/><br/>"You mean about Diderot?"<br/><br/>"No, not about Diderot. Above all, don't lie to yourself. The<br/>man who lies to himself and listens to his own lie comes to such a<br/>pass that he cannot distinguish the truth within him, or around<br/>him, and so loses all respect for himself and for others. And<br/>having no respect he ceases to love, and in order to occupy and<br/>distract himself without love he gives way to passions and coarse<br/>pleasures, and sinks to bestiality in his vices, all from continual<br/>lying to other men and to himself. The man who lies to himself can<br/>be more easily offended than anyone. You know it is sometimes very<br/>pleasant to take offence, isn't it? A man may know that nobody has<br/>insulted him, but that he has invented the insult for himself, has<br/>lied and exaggerated to make it picturesque, has caught at a word<br/>and made a mountain out of a molehill- he knows that himself, yet<br/>he will be the first to take offence, and will revel in his<br/>resentment till he feels great pleasure in it, and so pass to<br/>genuine vindictiveness. But get up, sit down, I beg you. All this,<br/>too, is deceitful posturing… ."<br/>
