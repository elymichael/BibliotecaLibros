<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>5<br/>A<br/>Sudden Catastrophe<br/><br/><br/>I MAY note that he had been called before Alyosha. But the usher<br/>of the court announced to the President that, owing to an attack of<br/>illness or some sort of fit, the witness could not appear at the<br/>moment, but was ready to give his evidence as soon as he recovered.<br/>But no one seemed to have heard it and it only came out later.<br/><br/>His entrance was for the first moment almost unnoticed. The<br/>principal witnesses, especially the two rival ladies, had already<br/>been questioned. Curiosity was satisfied for the time; the public<br/>was feeling almost fatigued. Several more witnesses were still to<br/>be heard, who probably had little information to give after all<br/>that had been given. Time was passing. Ivan walked up with<br/>extraordinary slowness, looking at no one, and with his head bowed,<br/>as though plunged in gloomy thought. He was irreproachably dressed,<br/>but his face made a painful impression, on me at least: there was<br/>an earthy look in it, a look like a dying man's. His eyes were<br/>lustreless; he raised them and looked slowly round the court.<br/>Alyosha jumped up from his seat and moaned "Ah!" I remember that,<br/>but it was hardly noticed.<br/><br/>The President began by informing him that he was a witness not<br/>on oath, that he might answer or refuse to answer, but that, of<br/>course, he must bear witness according to his conscience, and so<br/>on, and so on. Ivan listened and looked at him blankly, but his<br/>face gradually relaxed into a smile, and as soon as the President,<br/>looking at him in astonishment, finished, he laughed outright.<br/><br/>"Well, and what else?" he asked in a loud voice.<br/><br/>There was a hush in the court; there was a feeling of something<br/>strange. The President showed signs of uneasiness.<br/><br/>"Youâ€¦ are perhaps still unwell?" he began, looking everywhere<br/>for the usher.<br/><br/>"Don't trouble yourself, your excellency, I am well enough and<br/>can tell you something interesting," Ivan answered with sudden<br/>calmness and respectfulness.<br/>
