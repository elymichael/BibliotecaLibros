Alyosha turned away, wringing his hands. Grushenka ran out of
the house, laughing musically.

Katerina Ivanovna went into a fit of hysterics. She sobbed, and
was shaken with convulsions. Everyone fussed round her.

"I warned you," said the elder of her aunts. "I tried to prevent
your doing this. You're too impulsive. How could you do such a
thing? You don't know these creatures, and they say she's worse
than any of them. You are too self-willed."

"She's a tigress!" yelled Katerina Ivanovna. "Why did you hold
me, Alexey Fyodorovitch? I'd have beaten her- beaten her!"

She could not control herself before Alyosha; perhaps she did
not care to, indeed.

"She ought to be flogged in public on a scaffold!"

Alyosha withdrew towards the door.

"But, my God!" cried Katerina Ivanovna, clasping her hands. "He!
He! He could be so dishonourable, so inhuman! Why, he told that
creature what happened on that fatal, accursed day! 'You brought
your beauty for sale, dear young lady.' She knows it! Your
brother's a scoundrel, Alexey Fyodorovitch."

Alyosha wanted to say something, but he couldn't find a word.
His heart ached.

"Go away, Alexey Fyodorovitch! It's shameful, it's awful for me!
To-morrow, I beg you on my knees, come to-morrow. Don't condemm me.
Forgive me. I don't know what I shall do with myself now!"

Alyosha walked out into the street reeling. He could have wept
as she did. Suddenly he was overtaken by the maid.
