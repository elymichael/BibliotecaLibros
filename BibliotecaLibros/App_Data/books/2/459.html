<br/>"You've come at last!" she cried, flinging down the cards and<br/>joyfully greeting Alyosha, "and Maximushka's been scaring me that<br/>perhaps you wouldn't come. Ah, how I need you! Sit down to the<br/>table. What will you have coffee?"<br/><br/>"Yes, please," said Alyosha, sitting down at the table. "I am<br/>very hungry."<br/><br/>"That's right. Fenya, Fenya, coffee," cried Grushenka. "It's<br/>been made a long time ready for you. And bring some little pies,<br/>and mind they are hot. Do you know, we've had a storm over those<br/>pies to-day. I took them to the prison for him, and would you<br/>believe it, he threw them back to me: he would not eat them. He<br/>flung one of them on the floor and stamped on it. So I said to him:<br/>'I shall leave them with the warder; if you don't eat them before<br/>evening, it will be that your venomous spite is enough for you!'<br/>With that I went away. We quarrelled again, would you believe it?<br/>Whenever I go we quarrel."<br/><br/>Grushenka said all this in one breath in her agitation. Maximov,<br/>feeling nervous, at once smiled and looked on the floor.<br/><br/>"What did you quarrel about this time?" asked Alyosha.<br/><br/>"I didn't expect it in the least. Only fancy, he is jealous of<br/>the Pole. 'Why are you keeping him?' he said. 'So you've begun<br/>keeping him.' He is jealous, jealous of me all the time, jealous<br/>eating and sleeping! He even took into his head to be jealous of<br/>Kuzma last week."<br/><br/>"But he knew about the Pole before?"<br/><br/>"Yes, but there it is. He has known about him from the very<br/>beginning but to-day he suddenly got up and began scolding about<br/>him. I am ashamed to repeat what he said. Silly fellow! Rakitin<br/>went in as I came out. Perhaps Rakitin is egging him on. What do<br/>you think?" she added carelessly.<br/><br/>"He loves you, that's what it is; he loves you so much. And now<br/>he is particularly worried."<br/><br/>"I should think he might be, with the trial to-morrow. And I<br/>went to him to say something about to-morrow, for I dread to think<br/>what's going to happen then. You say that he is worried, but how<br/>worried I am! And he talks about the Pole! He's too silly! He is<br/>not jealous of Maximushka yet, anyway."<br/><br/>
