The boy waited for him without budging. Coming up to him,
Alyosha saw facing him a child of about nine years old. He was an
undersized weakly boy with a thin pale face, with large dark eyes
that gazed at him vindictively. He was dressed in a rather shabby
old overcoat, which he had monstrously outgrown. His bare arms
stuck out beyond his sleeves. There was a large patch on the right
knee of his trousers, and in his right boot just at the toe there
was a big hole in the leather, carefully blackened with ink. Both
the pockets of his greatcoat were weighed down with stones. Alyosha
stopped two steps in front of him, looking inquiringly at him, The
boy, seeing at once from Alyosha's eyes that he wouldn't beat him,
became less defiant, and addressed him first.

"I am alone, and there are six of them. I'll beat them all,
alone!" he said suddenly, with flashing eyes.

"I think one of the stones must have hurt you badly," observed
Alyosha.

"But I hit Smurov on the head!" cried the boy.

"They told me that you know me, and that you threw a stone at me
on purpose," said Alyosha.

The boy looked darkly at him.

"I don't know you. Do you know me?" Alyosha continued.

"Let me alone!" the boy cried irritably; but he did not move, as
though he were expecting something, and again there was a
vindictive light in his eyes.

"Very well, I am going," said Alyosha; "only I don't know you
and I don't tease you. They told me how they tease you, but I don't
want to tease you. Good-bye!"

"Monk in silk trousers!" cried the boy, following Alyosha with
the same vindictive and defiant expression, and he threw himself
into an attitude of defence, feeling sure that now Alyosha would
fall upon him; but Alyosha turned, looked at him, and walked away.
He had not gone three steps before the biggest stone the boy had in
his pocket hit him a painful blow in the back.
