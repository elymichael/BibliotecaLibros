"When I stood him drinks in the tavern, the man had quite a<br/>different face," thought Mitya, as he got in. At the gates there<br/>was a crowd of people, peasants, women, and drivers. Trifon<br/>Borissovitch came down the steps too. All stared at Mitya.<br/><br/>"Forgive me at parting, good people!" Mitya shouted suddenly<br/>from the cart.<br/><br/>"Forgive us too!" he heard two or three voices.<br/><br/>"Good-bye to you, too, Trifon Borissovitch!"<br/><br/>But Trifon Borissovitch did not even turn round. He was,<br/>perhaps, too busy. He, too, was shouting and fussing about<br/>something. It appeared that everything was not yet ready in the<br/>second cart, in which two constables were to accompany Mavriky<br/>Mavrikyevitch. The peasant who had been ordered to drive the second<br/>cart was pulling on his smock, stoutly maintaining that it was not<br/>his turn to go, but Akim's. But Akim was not to be seen. They ran<br/>to look for him. The peasant persisted and besought them to<br/>wait.<br/><br/>"You see what our peasants are, Mavriky Mavrikyevitch. They've<br/>no shame!" exclaimed Trifon Borissovitch. "Akim gave you<br/>twenty-five copecks the day before yesterday. You've drunk it all<br/>and now you cry out. I'm simply surprised at your good-nature, with<br/>our low peasants, Mavriky Mavrikyevitch, that's all I can say."<br/><br/>"But what do we want a second cart for?" Mitya put in. "Let's<br/>start with the one, Mavriky Mavrikyevitch. I won't be unruly, I<br/>won't run away from you, old fellow. What do we want an escort<br/>for?"<br/><br/>"I'll trouble you, sir, to learn how to speak to me if you've<br/>never been taught. I'm not 'old fellow' to you, and you can keep<br/>your advice for another time!" Mavriky Mavrikyevitch snapped out<br/>savagely, as though glad to vent his wrath.<br/><br/>Mitya was reduced to silence. He flushed all over. A moment<br/>later he felt suddenly very cold. The rain had ceased, but the dull<br/>sky was still overcast with clouds, and a keen wind was blowing<br/>straight in his face.<br/><br/>"I've taken a chill," thought Mitya, twitching his<br/>shoulders.<br/><br/>At last Mavriky Mavrikyevitch, too, got into the cart, sat down<br/>heavily, and, as though without noticing it, squeezed Mitya into<br/>the corner. It is true that he was out of humour and greatly<br/>disliked the task that had been laid upon him.<br/>
