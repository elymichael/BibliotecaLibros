"You are not a fool," said Ivan, seeming struck. The blood
rushed to his face. "You are serious now!" he observed, looking
suddenly at Smerdyakov with a different expression.

"It was your pride made you think I was a fool. Take the
money."

Ivan took the three rolls of notes and put them in his pocket
without wrapping them in anything.

"I shall show them at the court to-morrow," he said.

"Nobody will believe you, as you've plenty of money of your own;
you may simply have taken it out of your cash-box and brought it to
the court."

Ivan rose from his seat.

"I repeat," he said, "the only reason I haven't killed you is
that I need you for to-morrow, remember that, don't forget it!"

"Well, kill me. Kill me now," Smerdyakov said, all at once
looking strangely at Ivan. "You won't dare do that even!" he added,
with a bitter smile. "You won't dare to do anything, you, who used
to be so bold!"

"Till to-morrow," cried Ivan, and moved to go out.

"Stay a momentâ€¦ . Show me those notes again."
