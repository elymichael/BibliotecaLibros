<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>3<br/>The Schoolboy<br/><br/><br/>BUT Kolya did not hear her. At last he could go out. As he went<br/>out at the gate he looked round him, shrugged up his shoulders, and<br/>saying "It is freezing," went straight along the street and turned<br/>off to the right towards the market-place. When he reached the last<br/>house but one before the market-place he stopped at the gate,<br/>pulled a whistle out of his pocket, and whistled with all his might<br/>as though giving a signal. He had not to wait more than a minute<br/>before a rosy-cheeked boy of about eleven, wearing a warm, neat and<br/>even stylish coat, darted out to meet him. This was Smurov, a boy<br/>in the preparatory class (two classes below Kolya Krassotkin), son<br/>of a well-to-do official. Apparently he was forbidden by his<br/>parents to associate with Krassotkin, who was well known to be a<br/>desperately naughty boy, so Smurov was obviously slipping out on<br/>the sly. He was- if the reader has not forgotten one of the group<br/>of boys who two months before had thrown stones at Ilusha. He was<br/>the one who told Alyosha about Ilusha.<br/><br/>"I've been waiting for you for the last hour, Krassotkin," said<br/>Smurov stolidly, and the boys strode towards the market-place.<br/><br/>"I am late," answered Krassotkin. "I was detained by<br/>circumstances. You won't be thrashed for coming with me?"<br/><br/>"Come, I say, I'm never thrashed! And you've got Perezvon with<br/>you?"<br/><br/>"Yes."<br/><br/>"You're taking him, too?"<br/><br/>"Yes."<br/>
