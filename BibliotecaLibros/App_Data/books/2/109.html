Alyosha turned away, wringing his hands. Grushenka ran out of<br/>the house, laughing musically.<br/><br/>Katerina Ivanovna went into a fit of hysterics. She sobbed, and<br/>was shaken with convulsions. Everyone fussed round her.<br/><br/>"I warned you," said the elder of her aunts. "I tried to prevent<br/>your doing this. You're too impulsive. How could you do such a<br/>thing? You don't know these creatures, and they say she's worse<br/>than any of them. You are too self-willed."<br/><br/>"She's a tigress!" yelled Katerina Ivanovna.

I don't know what I shall do with myself now!"<br/><br/>Alyosha walked out into the street reeling. He could have wept<br/>as she did. Suddenly he was overtaken by the maid.<br/>
