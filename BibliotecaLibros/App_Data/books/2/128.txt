"What's that for?" The old man was a little surprised. "We shall
see each other again, or do you think we shan't?"

"Not at all, I didn't mean anything."

"Nor did I, I did not mean anything," said the old man, looking
at him. "Listen, listen," he shouted after him, "make haste and
come again and I'll have a fish soup for you, a fine one, not like
to-day. Be sure to come! Come to-morrow, do you hear,
to-morrow!"

And as soon as Alyosha had gone out of the door, he went to the
cupboard again and poured out another half-glass.

"I won't have more!" he muttered, clearing his throat, and again
he locked the cupboard and put the key in his pocket. Then he went
into his bedroom, lay down on the bed, exhausted, and in one minute
he was asleep.
