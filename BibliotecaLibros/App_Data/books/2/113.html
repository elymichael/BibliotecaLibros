"Brother, you don't seem to have noticed how you've insulted<br/>Katerina Ivanovna by telling Grushenka about that day. And she<br/>flung it in her face just now that she had gone to gentlemen in<br/>secret to sell her beauty! Brother, what could be worse than that<br/>insult?"<br/><br/>What worried Alyosha more than anything was that, incredible as<br/>it seemed, his brother appeared pleased at Katerina Ivanovna's<br/>humiliation.<br/><br/>"Bah!" Dmitri frowned fiercely, and struck his forehead with his<br/>hand. He only now realised it, though Alyosha had just told him of<br/>the insult, and Katerina Ivanovna's cry: "Your brother is a<br/>scoundrel"<br/><br/>"Yes, perhaps, I really did tell Grushenka about that 'fatal<br/>day,' as Katya calls it. Yes, I did tell her, I remember! It was<br/>that time at Mokroe. I was drunk, the Gypsies were singing… But I<br/>was sobbing. I was sobbing then, kneeling and praying to Katya's<br/>image, and Grushenka understood it. She understood it all then. I<br/>remember, she cried herself… . Damn it all! But it's bound to be so<br/>now… . Then she cried, but now 'the dagger in the heart'! That's<br/>how women are."<br/><br/>He looked down and sank into thought.<br/><br/>"Yes, I am a scoundrel, a thorough scoundrel" he said suddenly,<br/>in a gloomy voice. "It doesn't matter whether I cried or not, I'm a<br/>scoundrel! Tell her I accept the name, if that's any comfort. Come,<br/>that's enough. Good-bye. It's no use talking! It's not amusing. You<br/>go your way and I mine. And I don't want to see you again except as<br/>a last resource. Good-bye, Alexey!"<br/><br/>He warmly pressed Alyosha's hand, and still looking down,<br/>without raising his head, as though tearing himself away, turned<br/>rapidly towards the town.<br/><br/>Alyosha looked after him, unable to believe he would go away so<br/>abruptly.<br/><br/>"Stay, Alexey, one more confession to you alone" cried Dmitri,<br/>suddenly turning back. "Look at me. Look at me well. You see here,<br/>here- there's terrible disgrace in store for me." (As he said<br/>"here," Dmitri struck his chest with his fist with a strange air,<br/>as though the dishonour lay precisely on his chest, in some spot,<br/>in a pocket, perhaps, or hanging round his neck.) "You know me now,<br/>a scoundrel, an avowed scoundrel, but let me tell you that I've<br/>never done anything before and never shall again, anything that can<br/>compare in baseness with the dishonour which I bear now at this<br/>very minute on my breast, here, here, which will come to pass,<br/>though I'm perfectly free to stop it. I can stop it or carry it<br/>through, note that. Well, let me tell you, I shall carry it<br/>through. I shan't stop it. I told you everything just now, but I<br/>didn't tell you this, because even I had not brass enough for it. I<br/>can still pull up; if I do, I can give back the full half of my<br/>lost honour to-morrow. But I shan't pull up. I shall carry out my<br/>base plan, and you can bear witness that I told so beforehand.<br/>Darkness and destruction! No need to explain. You'll find out in<br/>due time. The filthy back-alley and the she-devil. Good-bye. Don't<br/>pray for me, I'm not worth it. And there's no need, no need at all…<br/>. I don't need it! Away!"<br/><br/>And he suddenly retreated, this time finally. Alyosha went<br/>towards the monastery.<br/><br/>"What? I shall never see him again! What is he saying?" he<br/>wondered wildly. "Why, I shall certainly see him to-morrow. I shall<br/>look him up. I shall make a point of it. What does he mean?"<br/>
