He ceased speaking suddenly, as though checking himself. After<br/>listening attentively and respectfully Ivan went on, addressing the<br/>elder with perfect composure and as before with ready<br/>cordiality:<br/><br/>"The whole point of my article lies in the fact that during the<br/>first three centuries Christianity only existed on earth in the<br/>Church and was nothing but the Church. When the pagan Roman Empire<br/>desired to become Christian, it inevitably happened that, by<br/>becoming Christian, it included the Church but remained a pagan<br/>State in very many of its departments. In reality this was bound to<br/>happen. But Rome as a State retained too much of the pagan<br/>civilisation and culture, as, for example, in the very objects and<br/>fundamental principles of the State. The Christian Church entering<br/>into the State could, of course, surrender no part of its<br/>fundamental principles- the rock on which it stands- and could<br/>pursue no other aims than those which have been ordained and<br/>revealed by God Himself, and among them that of drawing the whole<br/>world, and therefore the ancient pagan State itself, into the<br/>Church. In that way (that is, with a view to the future) it is not<br/>the Church that should seek a definite position in the State, like<br/>'every social organisation,' or as 'an organisation of men for<br/>religious purposes' (as my opponent calls the Church), but, on the<br/>contrary, every earthly State should be, in the end, completely<br/>transformed into the Church and should become nothing else but a<br/>Church, rejecting every purpose incongruous with the aims of the<br/>Church. All this will not degrade it in any way or take from its<br/>honour and glory as a great State, nor from the glory of its<br/>rulers, but only turns it from a false, still pagan, and mistaken<br/>path to the true and rightful path, which alone leads to the<br/>eternal goal. This is why the author of the book On the Foundations<br/>of Church Jurisdiction would have judged correctly if, in seeking<br/>and laying down those foundations, he bad looked upon them as a<br/>temporary compromise inevitable in our sinful and imperfect days.<br/>But as soon as the author ventures to declare that the foundations<br/>which he predicates now, part of which Father Iosif just<br/>enumerated, are the permanent, essential, and eternal foundations,<br/>he is going directly against the Church and its sacred and eternal<br/>vocation. That is the gist of my article."<br/><br/>"That is, in brief," Father Paissy began again, laying stress on<br/>each word, "according to certain theories only too clearly<br/>formulated in the nineteenth century, the Church ought to be<br/>transformed into the State, as though this would be an advance from<br/>a lower to a higher form, so as to disappear into it, making way<br/>for science, for the spirit of the age, and civilisation. And if<br/>the Church resists and is unwilling, some corner will be set apart<br/>for her in the State, and even that under control and this will be<br/>so everywhere in all modern European countries. But Russian hopes<br/>and conceptions demand not that the Church should pass as from a<br/>lower into a higher type into the State, but, on the contrary, that<br/>the State should end by being worthy to become only the Church and<br/>nothing else. So be it! So be it!"<br/><br/>"Well, I confess you've reassured me somewhat," Miusov said<br/>smiling, again crossing his legs. "So far as I understand, then,<br/>the realisation of such an ideal is infinitely remote, at the<br/>second coming of Christ. That's as you please. It's a beautiful<br/>Utopian dream of the abolition of war, diplomacy, banks, and so on-<br/>something after the fashion of socialism, indeed. But I imagined<br/>that it was all meant seriously, and that the Church might be now<br/>going to try criminals, and sentence them to beating, prison, and<br/>even death."<br/><br/>"But if there were none but the ecclesiastical court, the Church<br/>would not even now sentence a criminal to prison or to death. Crime<br/>and the way of regarding it would inevitably change, not all at<br/>once of course, but fairly soon," Ivan replied calmly, without<br/>flinching.<br/><br/>"Are you serious?" Miusov glanced keenly at him.<br/><br/>"If everything became the Church, the Church would exclude all<br/>the criminal and disobedient, and would not cut off their heads,"<br/>Ivan went on. "I ask you, what would become of the excluded? He<br/>would be cut off then not only from men, as now, but from Christ.<br/>By his crime he would have transgressed not only against men but<br/>against the Church of Christ. This is so even now, of course,<br/>strictly speaking, but it is not clearly enunciated, and very, very<br/>often the criminal of to-day compromises with his conscience: 'I<br/>steal,' he says, 'but I don't go against the Church. I'm not an<br/>enemy of Christ.' That's what the criminal of to-day is continually<br/>saying to himself, but when the Church takes the place of the State<br/>it will be difficult for him, in opposition to the Church all over<br/>the world, to say: 'All men are mistaken, all in error, all mankind<br/>are the false Church. I, a thief and murderer, am the only true<br/>Christian Church.' It will be very difficult to say this to<br/>himself; it requires a rare combination of unusual circumstances.<br/>Now, on the other side, take the Church's own view of crime: is it<br/>not bound to renounce the present almost pagan attitude, and to<br/>change from a mechanical cutting off of its tainted member for the<br/>preservation of society, as at present, into completely and<br/>honestly adopting the idea of the regeneration of the man, of his<br/>reformation and salvation?"<br/><br/>"What do you mean? I fail to understand again," Miusov<br/>interrupted. "Some sort of dream again. Something shapeless and<br/>even incomprehensible. What is excommunication? What sort of<br/>exclusion? I suspect you are simply amusing yourself, Ivan<br/>Fyodorovitch."<br/><br/>"Yes, but you know, in reality it is so now," said the elder<br/>suddenly, and all turned to him at once. "If it were not for the<br/>Church of Christ there would be nothing to restrain the criminal<br/>from evil-doing, no real chastisement for it afterwards; none, that<br/>is, but the mechanical punishment spoken of just now, which in the<br/>majority of cases only embitters the heart; and not the real<br/>punishment, the only effectual one, the only deterrent and<br/>softening one, which lies in the recognition of sin by<br/>conscience."<br/><br/>"How is that, may one inquire?" asked Miusov, with lively<br/>curiosity.<br/><br/>"Why," began the elder, "all these sentences to exile with hard<br/>labour, and formerly with flogging also, reform no one, and what's<br/>more, deter hardly a single criminal, and the number of crimes does<br/>not diminish but is continually on the increase. You must admit<br/>that. Consequently the security of society is not preserved, for,<br/>although the obnoxious member is mechanically cut off and sent far<br/>away out of sight, another criminal always comes to take his place<br/>at once, and often two of them. If anything does preserve society,<br/>even in our time, and does regenerate and transform the criminal,<br/>it is only the law of Christ speaking in his conscience. It is only<br/>by recognising his wrongdoing as a son of a Christian society- that<br/>is, of the Church- that he recognises his sin against society- that<br/>is, against the Church. So that it is only against the Church, and<br/>not against the State, that the criminal of to-day can recognise<br/>that he has sinned. If society, as a Church, had jurisdiction, then<br/>it would know when to bring back from exclusion and to reunite to<br/>itself. Now the Church having no real jurisdiction, but only the<br/>power of moral condemnation, withdraws of her own accord from<br/>punishing the criminal actively. She does not excommunicate him but<br/>simply persists in motherly exhortation of him. What is more, the<br/>Church even tries to preserve all Christian communion with the<br/>criminal. She admits him to church services, to the holy sacrament,<br/>gives him alms, and treats him more a captive than as a convict.<br/>And what would become of the criminal, O Lord, if even the<br/>Christian society- that is, the Church- were to reject him even as<br/>the civil law rejects him and cuts him off? What would become of<br/>him if the Church punished him with her excommunication as the<br/>direct consequence of the secular law? There could be no more<br/>terrible despair, at least for a Russian criminal, for Russian<br/>criminals still have faith. Though, who knows, perhaps then a<br/>fearful thing would happen, perhaps the despairing heart of the<br/>criminal would lose its faith and then what would become of him?<br/>But the Church, like a tender, loving mother, holds aloof from<br/>active punishment herself, as the sinner is too severely punished<br/>already by the civil law, and there must be at least someone to<br/>have pity on him. The Church holds aloof, above all, because its<br/>judgment is the only one that contains the truth, and therefore<br/>cannot practically and morally be united to any other judgment even<br/>as a temporary compromise. She can enter into no compact about<br/>that. The foreign criminal, they say, rarely repents, for the very<br/>doctrines of to-day confirm him in the idea that his crime is not a<br/>crime, but only a reaction against an unjustly oppressive force.<br/>Society cuts him off completely by a force that triumphs over him<br/>mechanically and (so at least they say of themselves in Europe)<br/>accompanies this exclusion with hatred, forgetfulness, and the most<br/>profound indifference as to the ultimate fate of the erring<br/>brother. In this way, it all takes place without the compassionate<br/>intervention of the Church, for in many cases there are no churches<br/>there at all, for though ecclesiastics and splendid church<br/>buildings remain, the churches themselves have long ago striven to<br/>pass from Church into State and to disappear in it completely. So<br/>it seems at least in Lutheran countries. As for Rome, it was<br/>proclaimed a State instead of a Church a thousand years ago. And so<br/>the criminal is no longer conscious of being a member of the Church<br/>and sinks into despair. If he returns to society, often it is with<br/>such hatred that society itself instinctively cuts him off. You can<br/>judge for yourself how it must end. In many cases it would seem to<br/>be the same with us, but the difference is that besides the<br/>established law courts we have the Church too, which always keeps<br/>up relations with the criminal as a dear and still precious son.<br/>And besides that, there is still preserved, though only in thought,<br/>the judgment of the Church, which though no longer existing in<br/>practice is still living as a dream for the future, and is, no<br/>doubt, instinctively recognised by the criminal in his soul. What<br/>was said here just now is true too, that is, that if the<br/>jurisdiction of the Church were introduced in practice in its full<br/>force, that is, if the whole of the society were changed into the<br/>Church, not only the judgment of the Church would have influence on<br/>the reformation of the criminal such as it never has now, but<br/>possibly also the crimes themselves would be incredibly diminished.<br/>And there can be no doubt that the Church would look upon the<br/>criminal and the crime of the future in many cases quite<br/>differently and would succeed in restoring the excluded, in<br/>restraining those who plan evil, and in regenerating the fallen. It<br/>is true," said Father Zossima, with a smile, "the Christian society<br/>now is not ready and is only resting on some seven righteous men,<br/>but as they are never lacking, it will continue still unshaken in<br/>expectation of its complete transformation from a society almost<br/>heathen in character into a single universal and all-powerful<br/>Church. So be it, so be it! Even though at the end of the ages, for<br/>it is ordained to come to pass! And there is no need to be troubled<br/>about times and seasons, for the secret of the times and seasons is<br/>in the wisdom of God, in His foresight, and His love. And what in<br/>human reckoning seems still afar off, may by the Divine ordinance<br/>be close at hand, on the eve of its appearance. And so be it, so be<br/>it!<br/>
