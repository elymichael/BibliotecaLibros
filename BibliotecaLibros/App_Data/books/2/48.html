<br/>"Good-bye! Forgive me, all of you" he said, bowing on all sides<br/>to his guests.<br/><br/>Dmitri stood for a few moments in amazement. Bowing down to him-<br/>what did it mean? Suddenly he cried aloud, "Oh God!" hid his face<br/>in his hands, and rushed out of the room. All the guests flocked<br/>out after him, in their confusion not saying good-bye, or bowing to<br/>their host. Only the monks went up to him again for a blessing.<br/><br/>"What did it mean, falling at his feet like that? Was it<br/>symbolic or what?" said Fyodor Pavlovitch, suddenly quieted and<br/>trying to reopen conversation without venturing to address anybody<br/>in particular. They were all passing out of the precincts of the<br/>hermitage at the moment.<br/><br/>"I can't answer for a madhouse and for madmen," Miusov answered<br/>at once ill-humouredly, "but I will spare myself your company,<br/>Fyodor Pavlovitch, and, trust me, for ever. Where's that monk?"<br/><br/>"That monk," that is, the monk who had invited them to dine with<br/>the Superior, did not keep them waiting. He met them as soon as<br/>they came down the steps from the elder's cell, as though he had<br/>been waiting for them all the time.<br/><br/>"Reverend Father, kindly do me a favour. Convey my deepest<br/>respect to the Father Superior, apologise for me, personally,<br/>Miusov, to his reverence, telling him that I deeply regret that<br/>owing to unforeseen circumstances I am unable to have the honour of<br/>being present at his table, greatly I should desire to do so,"<br/>Miusov said irritably to the monk.<br/><br/>"And that unforeseen circumstance, of course, is myself," Fyodor<br/>Pavlovitch cut in immediately. "Do you hear, Father; this gentleman<br/>doesn't want to remain in my company or else he'd come at once. And<br/>you shall go, Pyotr Alexandrovitch, pray go to the Father Superior<br/>and good appetite to you. I will decline, and not you. Home, home,<br/>I'll eat at home, I don't feel equal to it here, Pyotr<br/>Alexandrovitch, my amiable relative."<br/><br/>"I am not your relative and never have been, you contemptible<br/>man!"<br/><br/>"I said it on purpose to madden you, because you always disclaim<br/>the relationship, though you really are a relation in spite of your<br/>shuffling. I'll prove it by the church calendar. As for you, Ivan,<br/>stay if you like. I'll send the horses for you later. Propriety<br/>requires you to go to the Father Superior, Pyotr Alexandrovitch, to<br/>apologise for the disturbance we've been makingâ€¦ ."<br/><br/>"Is it true that you are going home? Aren't you lying?"<br/><br/>
