<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>9<br/>The Galloping Troika. The End of the Prosecutor's Speech<br/><br/><br/>IPPOLIT KIRILLOVITCH had chosen the historial method of<br/>exposition, beloved by all nervous orators, who find in its<br/>limitation a check on their own eager rhetoric. At this moment in<br/>his speech he went off into a dissertation on Grushenka's "first<br/>lover," and brought forward several interesting thoughts on this<br/>theme.<br/><br/>"Karamazov, who had been frantically jealous of everyone,<br/>collapsed, so to speak, and effaced himself at once before this<br/>first lover. What makes it all the more strange is that he seems to<br/>have hardly thought of this formidable rival. But he had looked<br/>upon him as a remote danger, and Karamazov always lives in the<br/>present. Possibly he regarded him as a fiction. But his wounded<br/>heart grasped instantly that the woman had been concealing this new<br/>rival and deceiving him, because he was anything but a fiction to<br/>her, because he was the one hope of her life. Grasping this<br/>instantly, he resigned himself.<br/><br/>"Gentlemen of the jury, I cannot help dwelling on this<br/>unexpected trait in the prisoner's character. He suddenly evinces<br/>an irresistible desire for justice, a respect for woman and a<br/>recognition of her right to love. And all this at the very moment<br/>when he had stained his hands with his father's blood for her sake!<br/>It is true that the blood he had shed was already crying out for<br/>vengeance, for, after having ruined his soul and his life in this<br/>world, he was forced to ask himself at that same instant what he<br/>was and what he could be now to her, to that being, dearer to him<br/>than his own soul, in comparison with that former lover who had<br/>returned penitent, with new love, to the woman he had once<br/>betrayed, with honourable offers, with the promise of a reformed<br/>and happy life. And he, luckless man, what could he give her now,<br/>what could he offer her?<br/><br/>"Karamazov felt all this, knew that all ways were barred to him<br/>by his crime and that he was a criminal under sentence, and not a<br/>man with life before him! This thought crushed him. And so he<br/>instantly flew to one frantic plan, which, to a man of Karamazov's<br/>character, must have appeared the one inevitable way out of his<br/>terrible position. That way out was suicide. He ran for the pistols<br/>he had left in pledge with his friend Perhotin and on the way, as<br/>he ran, he pulled out of his pocket the money, for the sake of<br/>which he had stained his hands with his father's gore. Oh, now he<br/>needed money more than ever. Karamazov would die, Karamazov would<br/>shoot himself and it should be remembered! To be sure, he was a<br/>poet and had burnt the candle at both ends all his life. 'To her,<br/>to her! and there, oh, there I will give a feast to the whole<br/>world, such as never was before, that will be remembered and talked<br/>of long after! In the midst of shouts of wild merriment, reckless<br/>gypsy songs and dances I shall raise the glass and drink to the<br/>woman I adore and her new-found happiness! And then, on the spot,<br/>at her feet, I shall dash out my brains before her and punish<br/>myself! She will remember Mitya Karamazov sometimes, she will see<br/>how Mitya loved her, she will feel for Mitya!'<br/><br/>"Here we see in excess a love of effect, a romantic despair and<br/>sentimentality, and the wild recklessness of the Karamazovs. Yes,<br/>but there is something else, gentlemen of the jury, something that<br/>cries out in the soul, throbs incessantly in the mind, and poisons<br/>the heart unto death- that something is conscience, gentlemen of<br/>the jury, its judgment, its terrible torments! The pistol will<br/>settle everything, the pistol is the only way out! But beyond- I<br/>don't know whether Karamazov wondered at that moment 'What lies<br/>beyond,' whether Karamazov could, like Hamlet, wonder 'What lies<br/>beyond.' No, gentlemen of the jury, they have their Hamlets, but we<br/>still have our Karamazovs!"<br/><br/>Here Ippolit Kirillovitch drew a minute picture of Mitya's<br/>preparations, the scene at Perhotin's, at the shop, with the<br/>drivers. He quoted numerous words and actions, confirmed by<br/>witnesses, and the picture made a terrible impression on the<br/>audience. The guilt of this harassed and desperate man stood out<br/>clear and convincing, when the facts were brought together.<br/><br/>"What need had he of precaution? Two or three times he almost<br/>confessed, hinted at it, all but spoke out." (Then followed the<br/>evidence given by witnesses.) "He even cried out to the peasant who<br/>drove him, 'Do you know, you are driving a murderer!' But it was<br/>impossible for him to speak out, he had to get to Mokroe and there<br/>to finish his romance. But what was awaiting the luckless man?<br/>Almost from the first minute at Mokroe he saw that his invincible<br/>rival was perhaps by no means so invincible, that the toast to<br/>their new-found happiness was not desired and would not be<br/>acceptable. But you know the facts, gentlemen of the jury, from the<br/>preliminary inquiry. Karamazov's triumph over his rival was<br/>complete and his soul passed into quite a new phase, perhaps the<br/>most terrible phase through which his soul has passed or will<br/>pass.<br/>
