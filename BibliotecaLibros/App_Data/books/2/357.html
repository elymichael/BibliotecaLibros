<br/>"Yes, I went a journey of forty versts into the country. Didn't<br/>you know?"<br/><br/>The prosecutor and Nikolay Parfenovitch exchanged glances.<br/><br/>"Well, how would it be if you began your story with a systematic<br/>description of all you did yesterday, from the morning onwards?<br/>Allow us, for instance, to inquire why you were absent from the<br/>town, and just when you left and when you came back- all those<br/>facts."<br/><br/>"You should have asked me like that from the beginning," cried<br/>Mitya, laughing aloud, "and, if you like, we won't begin from<br/>yesterday, but from the morning of the day before; then you'll<br/>understand how, why, and where I went. I went the day before<br/>yesterday, gentlemen, to a merchant of the town, called Samsonov,<br/>to borrow three thousand roubles from him on safe security. It was<br/>a pressing matter, gentlemen, it was a sudden necessity."<br/><br/>"Allow me to interrupt you," the prosecutor put in politely.<br/>"Why were you in such pressing need for just that sum, three<br/>thousand?"<br/><br/>"Oh, gentlemen, you needn't go into details, how, when and why,<br/>and why just so much money, and not so much, and all that<br/>rigmarole. Why, it'll run to three volumes, and then you'll want an<br/>epilogue!" Mitya said all this with the good-natured but impatient<br/>familiarity of a man who is anxious to tell the whole truth and is<br/>full of the best intentions.<br/><br/>"Gentlemen!"- he corrected himself hurriedly- "don't be vexed<br/>with me for my restiveness, I beg you again. Believe me once more,<br/>I feel the greatest respect for you and understand the true<br/>position of affairs. Don't think I'm drunk. I'm quite sober now.<br/>And, besides, being drunk would be no hindrance. It's with me, you<br/>know, like the saying: 'When he is sober, he is a fool; when he is<br/>drunk, he is a wise man.' Ha ha! But I see, gentlemen, it's not the<br/>proper thing to make jokes to you, till we've had our explanation,<br/>I mean. And I've my own dignity to keep up, too. I quite understand<br/>the difference for the moment. I am, after all, in the position of<br/>a criminal, and so, far from being on equal terms with you. And<br/>it's your business to watch me. I can't expect you to pat me on the<br/>head for what I did to Grigory, for one can't break old men's heads<br/>with impunity. I suppose you'll put me away for him for six months,<br/>or a year perhaps, in a house of correction. I don't know what the<br/>punishment is- but it will be without loss of the rights of my<br/>rank, without loss of my rank, won't it? So you see, gentlemen, I<br/>understand the distinction between usâ€¦ . But you must see that you<br/>could puzzle God Himself with such questions. 'How did you step?<br/>Where did you step? When did you step? And on what did you step?' I<br/>shall get mixed up, if you go on like this, and you will put it all<br/>down against me. And what will that lead to? To nothing! And even<br/>if it's nonsense I'm talking now, let me finish, and you,<br/>gentlemen, being men of honour and refinement, will forgive me!<br/>I'll finish by asking you, gentlemen, to drop that conventional<br/>method of questioning. I mean, beginning from some miserable<br/>trifle, how I got up, what I had for breakfast, how I spat, and<br/>where I spat, and so distracting the attention of the criminal,<br/>suddenly stun him with an overwhelming question, 'Whom did you<br/>murder? Whom did you rob?' Ha-ha! That's your regulation method,<br/>that's where all your cunning comes in. You can put peasants off<br/>their guard like that, but not me. I know the tricks. I've been in<br/>the service, too. Ha ha ha! You're not angry, gentlemen? You<br/>forgive my impertinence?" he cried, looking at them with a<br/>good-nature that was almost surprising. "It's only Mitya Karamazov,<br/>you know, so you can overlook it. It would be inexcusable in a<br/>sensible man; but you can forgive it in Mitya. Ha ha!"<br/><br/>Nikolay Parfenovitch listened, and laughed too. Though the<br/>prosecutor did not laugh, he kept his eyes fixed keenly on Mitya,<br/>as though anxious not to miss the least syllable, the slightest<br/>movement, the smallest twitch of any feature of his face.<br/><br/>"That's how we have treated you from the beginning," said<br/>Nikolay Parfenovitch, still laughing. "We haven't tried to put you<br/>out by asking how you got up in the morning and what you had for<br/>breakfast. We began, indeed, with questions of the greatest<br/>importance."<br/><br/>"I understand. I saw it and appreciated it, and I appreciate<br/>still more your present kindness to me, an unprecedented kindness,<br/>worthy of your noble hearts. We three here are gentlemen and let<br/>everything be on the footing of mutual confidence between educated,<br/>well-bred people, who have the common bond of noble birth and<br/>honour. In any case, allow me to look upon you as my best friends<br/>at this moment of my life, at this moment when my honour is<br/>assailed. That's no offence to you, gentlemen, is it?"<br/><br/>
