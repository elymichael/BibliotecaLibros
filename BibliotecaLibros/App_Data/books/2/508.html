<br/>When Ivan read this "document" he was convinced. So then it was<br/>his brother, not Smerdyakov. And if not Smerdyakov, then not he,<br/>Ivan. This letter at once assumed in his eyes the aspect of a<br/>logical proof. There could be no longer the slightest doubt of<br/>Mitya's guilt. The suspicion never occurred to Ivan, by the way,<br/>that Mitya might have committed the murder in conjunction with<br/>Smerdyakov, and, indeed, such a theory did not fit in with the<br/>facts. Ivan was completely reassured. The next morning he only<br/>thought of Smerdyakov and his gibes with contempt. A few days later<br/>he positively wondered how he could have been so horribly<br/>distressed at his suspicions. He resolved to dismiss him with<br/>contempt and forget him. So passed a month. He made no further<br/>inquiry about Smerdyakov, but twice he happened to hear that he was<br/>very ill and out of his mind.<br/><br/>"He'll end in madness," the young doctor Varvinsky observed<br/>about him, and Ivan remembered this. During the last week of that<br/>month Ivan himself began to feel very ill. He went to consult the<br/>Moscow doctor who had been sent for by Katerina Ivanovna just<br/>before the trial. And just at that time his relations with Katerina<br/>Ivanovna became acutely strained. They were like two enemies in<br/>love with one another. Katerina Ivanovna's "returns" to Mitya, that<br/>is, her brief but violent revulsions of feeling in his favour,<br/>drove Ivan to perfect frenzy. Strange to say, until that last scene<br/>described above, when Alyosha came from Mitya to Katerina Ivanovna,<br/>Ivan had never once, during that month, heard her express a doubt<br/>of Mitya's guilt, in spite of those "returns" that were so hateful<br/>to him. It is remarkable, too, that while he felt that he hated<br/>Mitya more and more every day, he realised that it was not on<br/>account of Katya's "returns" that he hated him, but just because he<br/>was the murderer of his father. He was conscious of this and fully<br/>recognised it to himself<br/><br/>Nevertheless, he went to see Mitya ten days before the trial and<br/>proposed to him a plan of escape- a plan he had obviously thought<br/>over a long time. He was partly impelled to do this by a sore place<br/>still left in his heart from a phrase of Smerdyakov's, that it was<br/>to his, Ivan's, advantage that his brother should be convicted, as<br/>that would increase his inheritance and Alyosha's from forty to<br/>sixty thousand roubles. He determined to sacrifice thirty thousand<br/>on arranging Mitya's escape. On his return from seeing him, he was<br/>very mournful and dispirited; he suddenly began to feel that he was<br/>anxious for Mitya's escape, not only to heal that sore place by<br/>sacrificing thirty thousand, but for another reason. "Is it because<br/>I am as much a murderer at heart?" he asked himself. Something very<br/>deep down seemed burning and rankling in his soul. His pride above<br/>all suffered cruelly all that month. But of that laterâ€¦ .<br/><br/>When, after his conversation with Alyosha, Ivan suddenly decided<br/>with his hand on the bell of his lodging to go to Smerdyakov, he<br/>obeyed a sudden and peculiar impulse of indignation. He suddenly<br/>remembered how Katerina Ivanovna had only just cried out to him in<br/>Alyosha's presence: "It was you, you, persuaded me of his" (that<br/>is, Mitya's) "guilt!" Ivan was thunderstruck when he recalled it.<br/>He had never once tried to persuade her that Mitya was the<br/>murderer; on the contrary, he had suspected himself in her<br/>presence, that time when he came back from Smerdyakov. It was she,<br/>she, who had produced that "document" and proved his brother's<br/>guilt. And now she suddenly exclaimed: "I've been at Smerdyakov's<br/>myself!" When had she been there? Ivan had known nothing of it. So<br/>she was not at all so sure of Mitya's guilt! And what could<br/>Smerdyakov have told her? What, what, had he said to her? His heart<br/>burned with violent anger. He could not understand how he could,<br/>half an hour before, have let those words pass and not have cried<br/>out at the moment. He let go of the bell and rushed off to<br/>Smerdyakov. "I shall kill him, perhaps, this time," he thought on<br/>the way.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
