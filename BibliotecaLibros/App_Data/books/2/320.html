"How's this, Panovie?" cried Mitya, "won't you drink it?"<br/><br/>Pan Vrublevsky took the glass, raised it and said with a<br/>resonant voice:<br/><br/>"To Russia as she was before 1772."<br/><br/>"Come, that's better!" cried the other Pole, and they both<br/>emptied their glasses at once.<br/><br/>"You're fools, you Panovie," broke suddenly from Mitya.<br/><br/>"Panie!" shouted both the Poles, menacingly, setting on Mitya<br/>like a couple of cocks. Pan Vrublevsky was specially furious.<br/><br/>"Can one help loving one's own country?" he shouted.<br/><br/>"Be silent! Don't quarrel! I won't have any quarrelling!" cried<br/>Grushenka imperiously, and she stamped her foot on the floor. Her<br/>face glowed, her eyes were shining. The effects of the glass she<br/>had just drunk were apparent. Mitya was terribly alarmed.<br/><br/>"Panovie, forgive me! It was my fault, I'm sorry. Vrublevsky,<br/>panie Vrublevsky, I'm sorry."<br/><br/>"Hold your tongue, you, anyway! Sit down, you stupid!".<br/>Grushenka scolded with angry annoyance.<br/><br/>Everyone sat down, all were silent, looking at one another.<br/>
