<br/>"No, I never dreamed of thinking you a vulgar fool. You are<br/>clever butâ€¦ never mind, I was silly to smile. I understand your<br/>getting hot about it, Misha. I guess from your warmth that you are<br/>not indifferent to Katerina Ivanovna yourself; I've suspected that<br/>for a long time, brother, that's why you don't like my brother<br/>Ivan. Are you jealous of him?"<br/><br/>"And jealous of her money, too? Won't you add that?"<br/><br/>"I'll say nothing about money. I am not going to insult<br/>you."<br/><br/>"I believe it, since you say so, but confound you, and your<br/>brother Ivan with you. Don't you understand that one might very<br/>well dislike him, apart from Katerina Ivanovna. And why the devil<br/>should I like him? He condescends to abuse me, you know. Why<br/>haven't I a right to abuse him?"<br/><br/>"I never heard of his saying anything about you, good or bad. He<br/>doesn't speak of you at all."<br/><br/>"But I heard that the day before yesterday at Katerina<br/>Ivanovna's he was abusing me for all he was worth- you see what an<br/>interest he takes in your humble servant. And which is the jealous<br/>one after that, brother, I can't say. He was so good as to express<br/>the opinion that, if I don't go in for the career of an<br/>archimandrite in the immediate future and don't become a monk, I<br/>shall be sure to go to Petersburg and get on to some solid magazine<br/>as a reviewer, that I shall write for the next ten years, and in<br/>the end become the owner of the magazine, and bring it out on the<br/>liberal and atheistic side, with a socialistic tinge, with a tiny<br/>gloss of socialism, but keeping a sharp lookout all the time, that<br/>is, keeping in with both sides and hoodwinking the fools. According<br/>to your brother's account, the tinge of socialism won't hinder me<br/>from laying by the proceeds and investing them under the guidance<br/>of some Jew, till at the end of my career I build a great house in<br/>Petersburg and move my publishing offices to it, and let out the<br/>upper stories to lodgers. He has even chosen the place for it, near<br/>the new stone bridge across the Neva, which they say is to be built<br/>in Petersburg."<br/><br/>"Ah, Misha, that's just what will really happen, every word of<br/>it," cried Alyosha, unable to restrain a good-humoured smile.<br/><br/>"You are pleased to be sarcastic, too, Alexey Fyodorovitch."<br/><br/>"No, no, I'm joking, forgive me. I've something quite different<br/>in my mind. But, excuse me, who can have told you all this? You<br/>can't have been at Katerina Ivanovna's yourself when he was talking<br/>about you?"<br/><br/>"I wasn't there, but Dmitri Fyodorovitch was; and I heard him<br/>tell it with my own ears; if you want to know, he didn't tell me,<br/>but I overheard him, unintentionally, of course, for I was sitting<br/>in Grushenka's bedroom and I couldn't go away because Dmitri<br/>Fyodorovitch was in the next room."<br/><br/>
