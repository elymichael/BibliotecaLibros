<br/>"I do, blessed Father."<br/><br/>"You think it's an elm, but for me it has another shape."<br/><br/>"What sort of shape?" inquired the monk, after a pause of vain<br/>expectation.<br/><br/>"It happens at night. You see those two branches? In the night<br/>it is Christ holding out His arms to me and seeking me with those<br/>arms, I see it clearly and tremble. It's terrible, terrible!"<br/><br/>"What is there terrible if it's Christ Himself?"<br/><br/>"Why, He'll snatch me up and carry me away."<br/><br/>"Alive?"<br/><br/>"In the spirit and glory of Elijah, haven't you heard? He will<br/>take me in His arms and bear me away."<br/><br/>Though the monk returned to the cell he was sharing with one of<br/>the brothers, in considerable perplexity of mind, he still<br/>cherished at heart a greater reverence for Father Ferapont than for<br/>Father Zossima. He was strongly in favour of fasting, and it was<br/>not strange that one who kept so rigid a fast as Father Ferapont<br/>should "see marvels."

But he did not pay<br/>much attention to him at the time, and only recollected it<br/>afterwards.<br/><br/>He had no thought to spare for it indeed, for when Father<br/>Zossima, feeling tired again, had gone back to bed, he thought of<br/>Alyosha as he was closing his eyes, and sent for him. Alyosha ran<br/>at once. There was no one else in the cell but Father Paissy,<br/>Father Iosif, and the novice Porfiry.
