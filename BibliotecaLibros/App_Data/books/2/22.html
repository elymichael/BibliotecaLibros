<br/>"But you are not a king, anyway," Miusov muttered, losing his<br/>self-restraint at once.<br/><br/>"Yes; that's true. I'm not a king, and, would you believe it,<br/>Pyotr Alexandrovitch, I was aware of that myself. But, there! I<br/>always say the wrong thing. Your reverence," he cried, with sudden<br/>pathos, "you behold before you a buffoon in earnest! I introduce<br/>myself as such. It's an old habit, alas! And if I sometimes talk<br/>nonsense out of place it's with an object, with the object of<br/>amusing people and making myself agreeable. One must be agreeable,<br/>mustn't one? I was seven years ago in a little town where I had<br/>business, and I made friends with some merchants there. We went to<br/>the captain of police because we had to see him about something,<br/>and to ask him to dine with us. He was a tall, fat, fair, sulky<br/>man, the most dangerous type in such cases. It's their liver. I<br/>went straight up to him, and with the ease of a man of the world,<br/>you know, 'Mr. Ispravnik,' said I, 'be our Napravnik.' 'What do you<br/>mean by Napravnik?' said he. I saw, at the first half-second, that<br/>it had missed fire. He stood there so glum. 'I wanted to make a<br/>joke,' said I, 'for the general diversion, as Mr. Napravnik is our<br/>well-known Russian orchestra conductor and what we need for the<br/>harmony of our undertaking is someone of that sort.' And I<br/>explained my comparison very reasonably, didn't I? 'Excuse me,'<br/>said he, 'I am an Ispravnik, and I do not allow puns to be made on<br/>my calling.' He turned and walked away. I followed him, shouting,<br/>'Yes, yes, you are an Ispravnik, not a Napravnik.' 'No,' he said,<br/>'since you called me a Napravnik I am one.' And would you believe<br/>it, it ruined our business! And I'm always like that, always like<br/>that. Always injuring myself with my politeness. Once, many years<br/>ago, I said to an influential person: 'Your wife is a ticklish<br/>lady,' in an honourable sense, of the moral qualities, so to speak.<br/>But he asked me, 'Why, have you tickled her?' I thought I'd be<br/>polite, so I couldn't help saying, 'Yes,' and he gave me a fine<br/>tickling on the spot. Only that happened long ago, so I'm not<br/>ashamed to tell the story. I'm always injuring myself like<br/>that."<br/><br/>"You're doing it now," muttered Miusov, with disgust.<br/><br/>Father Zossima scrutinised them both in silence.<br/><br/>"Am I? Would you believe it, I was aware of that, too, Pyotr<br/>Alexandrovitch, and let tell you, indeed, I foresaw I should as<br/>soon as I began to speak. And do you know I foresaw, too, that<br/>you'd be the first to remark on it. The minute I see my joke isn't<br/>coming off, your reverence, both my cheeks feel as though they were<br/>drawn down to the lower jaw and there is almost a spasm in them.<br/>That's been so since I was young, when I had to make jokes for my<br/>living in noblemen's families. I am an inveterate buffoon, and have<br/>been from birth up, your reverence, it's as though it were a craze<br/>in me. I dare say it's a devil within me. But only a little one. A<br/>more serious one would have chosen another lodging. But not your<br/>soul, Pyotr Alexandrovitch; you're not a lodging worth having<br/>either. But I do believe- I believe in God, though I have had<br/>doubts of late. But now I sit and await words of wisdom. I'm like<br/>the philosopher, Diderot, your reverence. Did you ever hear, most<br/>Holy Father, how Diderot went to see the Metropolitan Platon, in<br/>the time of the Empress Catherine? He went in and said straight<br/>out, 'There is no God.' To which the great bishop lifted up his<br/>finger and answered, 'The fool has said in his heart there is no<br/>God and he fell down at his feet on the spot. 'I believe,' he<br/>cried, 'and will be christened.' And so he was. Princess Dashkov<br/>was his godmother, and Potyomkin his godfather."<br/><br/>"Fyodor Pavlovitch, this is unbearable! You know you're telling<br/>lies and that that stupid anecdote isn't true. Why are you playing<br/>the fool?" cried Miusov in a shaking voice.<br/><br/>"I suspected all my life that it wasn't true," Fyodor Pavlovitch<br/>cried with conviction. "But I'll tell you the whole truth,<br/>gentlemen. Great elder! Forgive me, the last thing about Diderot's<br/>christening I made up just now. I never thought of it before. I<br/>made it up to add piquancy. I play the fool, Pyotr Alexandrovitch,<br/>to make myself agreeable. Though I really don't know myself,<br/>sometimes, what I do it for. And as for Diderot, I heard as far as<br/>'the fool hath said in his heart' twenty times from the gentry<br/>about here when I was young. I heard your aunt, Pyotr<br/>Alexandrovitch, tell the story. They all believe to this day that<br/>the infidel Diderot came to dispute about God with the Metropolitan<br/>Platon… ."<br/><br/>Miusov got up, forgetting himself in his impatience. He was<br/>furious, and conscious of being ridiculous.<br/><br/>What was taking place in the cell was really incredible. For<br/>forty or fifty years past, from the times of former elders, no<br/>visitors had entered that cell without feelings of the profoundest<br/>veneration. Almost everyone admitted to the cell felt that a great<br/>favour was being shown him. Many remained kneeling during the whole<br/>visit. Of those visitors, many had been men of high rank and<br/>learning, some even free thinkers, attracted by curiosity, but all<br/>without exception had shown the profoundest reverence and delicacy,<br/>for here there was no question of money, but only, on the one side<br/>love and kindness, and on the other penitence and eager desire to<br/>decide some spiritual problem or crisis. So that such buffoonery<br/>amazed and bewildered the spectators, or at least some of them. The<br/>monks, with unchanged countenances, waited, with earnest attention,<br/>to hear what the elder would say, but seemed on the point of<br/>standing up, like Miusov. Alyosha stood, with hanging head, on the<br/>verge of tears. What seemed to him strangest of all was that his<br/>brother Ivan, on whom alone he had rested his hopes, and who alone<br/>had such influence on his father that he could have stopped him,<br/>sat now quite unmoved, with downcast eyes, apparently waiting with<br/>interest to see how it would end, as though he had nothing to do<br/>with it. Alyosha did not dare to look at Rakitin, the divinity<br/>student, whom he knew almost intimately. He alone in the monastery<br/>knew Rakitin's thoughts.<br/><br/>"Forgive me," began Miusov, addressing Father Zossima, "for<br/>perhaps I seem to be taking part in this shameful foolery. I made a<br/>mistake in believing that even a man like Fyodor Pavlovitch would<br/>understand what was due on a visit to so honoured a personage. I<br/>did not suppose I should have to apologise simply for having come<br/>with him… ."<br/><br/>
