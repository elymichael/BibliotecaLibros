<br/>For a long while I could not believe him, and I did not believe<br/>him at that time, but only after he had been to see me three days<br/>running and told me all about it. I thought he was mad, but ended<br/>by being convinced, to my great grief and amazement. His crime was<br/>a great and terrible one.<br/><br/>Fourteen years before, he had murdered the widow of a landowner,<br/>a wealthy and handsome young woman who had a house in our town. He<br/>fell passionately in love with her, declared his feeling and tried<br/>to persuade her to marry him. But she had already given her heart<br/>to another man, an officer of noble birth and high rank in the<br/>service, who was at that time away at the front, though she was<br/>expecting him soon to return. She refused his offer and begged him<br/>not to come and see her. After he had ceased to visit her, he took<br/>advantage of his knowledge of the house to enter at night through<br/>the garden by the roof, at great risk of discovery. But, as often<br/>happens, a crime committed with extraordinary audacity is more<br/>successful than others.<br/><br/>Entering the garret through the skylight, he went down the<br/>ladder, knowing that the door at the bottom of it was sometimes,<br/>through the negligence of the servants, left unlocked. He hoped to<br/>find it so, and so it was. He made his way in the dark to her<br/>bedroom, where a light was burning. As though on purpose, both her<br/>maids had gone off to a birthday party in the same street, without<br/>asking leave. The other servants slept in the servants' quarters or<br/>in the kitchen on the ground floor. His passion flamed up at the<br/>sight of her asleep, and then vindictive, jealous anger took<br/>possession of his heart, and like a drunken man, beside himself, he<br/>thrust a knife into her heart, so that she did not even cry out.<br/>Then with devilish and criminal cunning he contrived that suspicion<br/>should fall on the servants. He was so base as to take her purse,<br/>to open her chest with keys from under her pillow, and to take some<br/>things from it, doing it all as it might have been done by an<br/>ignorant servant, leaving valuable papers and taking only money. He<br/>took some of the larger gold things, but left smaller articles that<br/>were ten times as valuable. He took with him, too, some things for<br/>himself as remembrances, but of that later. Having done this awful<br/>deed. he returned by the way he had come.<br/><br/>Neither the next day, when the alarm was raised, nor at any time<br/>after in his life, did anyone dream of suspecting that he was the<br/>criminal. No one indeed knew of his love for her, for he was always<br/>reserved and silent and had no friend to whom he would have opened<br/>his heart. He was looked upon simply as an acquaintance, and not a<br/>very intimate one, of the murdered woman, as for the previous<br/>fortnight he had not even visited her. A serf of hers called Pyotr<br/>was at once suspected, and every circumstance confirmed the<br/>suspicion. The man knew- indeed his mistress did not conceal the<br/>fact- that having to send one of her serfs as a recruit she had<br/>decided to send him, as he had no relations and his conduct was<br/>unsatisfactory. People had heard him angrily threatening to murder<br/>her when he was drunk in a tavern. Two days before her death, he<br/>had run away, staying no one knew where in the town. The day after<br/>the murder, he was found on the road leading out of the town, dead<br/>drunk, with a knife in his pocket, and his right hand happened to<br/>be stained with blood. He declared that his nose had been bleeding,<br/>but no one believed him. The maids confessed that they had gone to<br/>a party and that the street door had been left open till they<br/>returned. And a number of similar details came to light, throwing<br/>suspicion on the innocent servant.<br/><br/>They arrested him, and he was tried for the murder; but a week<br/>after the arrest, the prisoner fell sick of a fever and died<br/>unconscious in the hospital. There the matter ended and the judges<br/>and the authorities and everyone in the town remained convinced<br/>that the crime had been committed by no one but the servant who had<br/>died in the hospital. And after that the punishment began.<br/><br/>My mysterious visitor, now my friend, told me that at first he<br/>was not in the least troubled by pangs of conscience. He was<br/>miserable a long time, but not for that reason; only from regret<br/>that he had killed the woman he loved, that she was no more, that<br/>in killing her he had killed his love, while the fire of passion<br/>was still in his veins. But of the innocent blood he had shed, of<br/>the murder of a fellow creature, he scarcely thought. The thought<br/>that his victim might have become the wife of another man was<br/>insupportable to him, and so, for a long time, he was convinced in<br/>his conscience that he could not have acted otherwise.<br/><br/>At first he was worried at the arrest of the servant, but his<br/>illness and death soon set his mind at rest, for the man's death<br/>was apparently (so he reflected at the time) not owing to his<br/>arrest or his fright, but a chill he had taken on the day he ran<br/>away, when he had lain all night dead drunk on the damp ground. The<br/>theft of the money and other things troubled him little, for he<br/>argued that the theft had not been committed for gain but to avert<br/>suspicion. The sum stolen was small, and he shortly afterwards<br/>subscribed the whole of it, and much more, towards the funds for<br/>maintaining an almshouse in the town. He did this on purpose to set<br/>his conscience at rest about the theft, and it's a remarkable fact<br/>that for a long time he really was at peace- he told me this<br/>himself. He entered then upon a career of great activity in the<br/>service, volunteered for a difficult and laborious duty, which<br/>occupied him two years, and being a man of strong will almost<br/>forgot the past. Whenever he recalled it, he tried not to think of<br/>it at all. He became active in philanthropy too, founded and helped<br/>to maintain many institutions in the town, did a good deal in the<br/>two capitals, and in both Moscow and Petersburg was elected a<br/>member of philanthropic societies.<br/><br/>At last, however, he began brooding over the past, and the<br/>strain of it was too much for him. Then he was attracted by a fine<br/>and intelligent girl and soon after married her, hoping that<br/>marriage would dispel his lonely depression, and that by entering<br/>on a new life and scrupulously doing his duty to his wife and<br/>children, he would escape from old memories altogether. But the<br/>very opposite of what he expected happened. He began, even in the<br/>first month of his marriage, to be continually fretted by the<br/>thought, "My wife loves me- but what if she knew?" When she first<br/>told him that she would soon bear him a child, he was troubled. "I<br/>am giving life, but I have taken life." Children came. "How dare I<br/>love them, teach and educate them, how can I talk to them of<br/>virtue? I have shed blood." They were splendid children, he longed<br/>to caress them; "and I can't look at their innocent candid faces, I<br/>am unworthy."<br/><br/>At last he began to be bitterly and ominously haunted by the<br/>blood of his murdered victim, by the young life he had destroyed,<br/>by the blood that cried out for vengeance. He had begun to have<br/>awful dreams. But, being a man of fortitude, he bore his suffering<br/>a long time, thinking: "I shall expiate everything by this secret<br/>agony." But that hope, too, was vain; the longer it went on, the<br/>more intense was his suffering.<br/><br/>He was respected in society for his active benevolence, though<br/>everyone was overawed by his stern and gloomy character. But the<br/>more he was respected, the more intolerable it was for him. He<br/>confessed to me that he had thoughts of killing himself. But he<br/>began to be haunted by another idea- an idea which he had at first<br/>regarded as impossible and unthinkable, though at last it got such<br/>a hold on his heart that he could not shake it off. He dreamed of<br/>rising up, going out and confessing in the face of all men that he<br/>had committed murder. For three years this dream had pursued him,<br/>haunting him in different forms. At last he believed with his whole<br/>heart that if he confessed his crime, he would heal his soul and<br/>would be at peace for ever. But this belief filled his heart with<br/>terror, for how could he carry it out? And then came what happened<br/>at my duel.<br/><br/>
