<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>8<br/>Delirium<br/><br/><br/>WHAT followed was almost an orgy, a feast to which all were<br/>welcome. Grushenka was the first to call for wine.<br/><br/>"I want to drink. I want to be quite drunk, as we were before.<br/>Do you remember, Mitya, do you remember how we made friends here<br/>last time!"<br/><br/>Mitya himself was almost delirious, feeling that his happiness<br/>was at hand. But Grushenka was continually sending him away from<br/>her.<br/><br/>"Go and enjoy yourself. Tell them to dance, to make merry, 'let<br/>the stove and cottage dance'; as we had it last time," she kept<br/>exclaiming. She was tremendously excited. And Mitya hastened to<br/>obey her. The chorus were in the next room. The room in which they<br/>had been sitting till that moment was too small, and was divided in<br/>two by cotton curtains, behind which was a huge bed with a puffy<br/>feather mattress and a pyramid of cotton pillows. In the four rooms<br/>for visitors there were beds. Grushenka settled herself just at the<br/>door. Mitya set an easy chair for her. She had sat in the same<br/>place to watch the dancing and singing "the time before," when they<br/>had made merry there. All the girls who had come had been there<br/>then; the Jewish band with fiddles and zithers had come, too, and<br/>at last the long expected cart had arrived with the wines and<br/>provisions.<br/><br/>Mitya bustled about. All sorts of people began coming into the<br/>room to look on, peasants and their women, who had been roused from<br/>sleep and attracted by the hopes of another marvellous<br/>entertainment such as they had enjoyed a month before. Mitya<br/>remembered their faces, greeting and embracing everyone he knew. He<br/>uncorked bottles and poured out wine for everyone who presented<br/>himself. Only the girls were very eager for the champagne. The men<br/>preferred rum, brandy, and, above all, hot punch. Mitya had<br/>chocolate made for all the girls, and ordered that three samovars<br/>should be kept boiling all night to provide tea and punch for<br/>everyone to help himself.<br/><br/>An absurd chaotic confusion followed, but Mitya was in his<br/>natural element, and the more foolish it became, the more his<br/>spirits rose. If the peasants had asked him for money at that<br/>moment, he would have pulled out his notes and given them away<br/>right and left. This was probably why the landlord, Trifon<br/>Borissovitch, kept hovering about Mitya to protect him. He seemed<br/>to have given up all idea of going to bed that night; but he drank<br/>little, only one glass of punch, and kept a sharp look-out on<br/>Mitya's interests after his own fashion. He intervened in the nick<br/>of time, civilly and obsequiously persuading Mitya not to give away<br/>"cigars and Rhine wine," and, above all, money to the peasants as<br/>he had done before. He was very indignant, too, at the peasant<br/>girls drinking liqueur, and eating sweets.<br/><br/>"They're a lousy lot, Dmitri Fyodorovitch," he said. "I'd give<br/>them a kick, every one of them, and they'd take it as an honour-<br/>that's all they're worth!"<br/>
