<br/>"Then you did take- but you have not given it back yet… or have<br/>you?"<br/><br/>"That's of no consequence," muttered Rakitin, "I refuse to<br/>answer such questions… . Of course, I shall give it back."<br/><br/>The President intervened, but Fetyukovitch declared he had no<br/>more questions to ask of the witness. Mr. Rakitin left the<br/>witness-box not absolutely without a stain upon his character. The<br/>effect left by the lofty idealism of his speech was somewhat<br/>marred, and Fetyukovitch's expression, as he watched him walk away,<br/>seemed to suggest to the public "this is a specimen of the<br/>lofty-minded persons who accuse him." I remember that this<br/>incident, too, did not pass off without an outbreak from Mitya.<br/>Enraged by the tone in which Rakitin had referred to Grushenka, he<br/>suddenly shouted "Bernard!" When, after Rakitin's<br/>cross-examination, the President asked the prisoner if he had<br/>anything to say, Mitya cried loudly:<br/><br/>"Since I've been arrested, he has borrowed money from me! He is<br/>a contemptible Bernard and opportunist, and he doesn't believe in<br/>God; he took the bishop in!"<br/><br/>Mitya of course, was pulled up again for the intemperance of his<br/>language, but Rakitin was done for. Captain Snegiryov's evidence<br/>was a failure, too, but from quite a different reason. He appeared<br/>in ragged and dirty clothes, muddy boots, and in spite of the<br/>vigilance and expert observation of the police officers, he turned<br/>out to be hopelessly drunk. On being asked about Mitya's attack<br/>upon him, he refused to answer.<br/><br/>"God bless him. Ilusha told me not to. God will make it up to me<br/>yonder."<br/><br/>"Who told you not to tell? Of whom are you talking?"<br/><br/>"Ilusha, my little son. 'Father, father, how he insulted you!'<br/>He said that at the stone. Now he is dying… "<br/><br/>The captain suddenly began sobbing, and plumped down on His<br/>knees before the President. He was hurriedly led away amidst the<br/>laughter of the public. The effect prepared by the prosecutor did<br/>not come off at all.<br/><br/>Fetyukovitch went on making the most of every opportunity, and<br/>amazed people more and more by his minute knowledge of the case.<br/>Thus, for example, Trifon Borissovitch made a great impression, of<br/>course, very prejudicial to Mitya. He calculated almost on his<br/>fingers that on his first visit to Mokroe, Mitya must have spent<br/>three thousand roubles, "or very little less. Just think what he<br/>squandered on those gypsy girls alone! And as for our lousy<br/>peasants, it wasn't a case of flinging half a rouble in the street,<br/>he made them presents of twenty-five roubles each, at least, he<br/>didn't give them less. And what a lot of money was simply stolen<br/>from him! And if anyone did steal, he did not leave a receipt. How<br/>could one catch the thief when he was flinging his money away all<br/>the time? Our peasants are robbers, you know; they have no care for<br/>their souls. And the way he went on with the girls, our village<br/>girls! They're completely set up since then, I tell you, they used<br/>to be poor." He recalled, in fact, every item of expense and added<br/>it all up. So the theory that only fifteen hundred had been spent<br/>and the rest had been put aside in a little bag seemed<br/>inconceivable.<br/><br/>
