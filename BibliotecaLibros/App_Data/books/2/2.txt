About Dostoyevsky:

Fyodor Mikhailovich Dostoevsky (November 11 [O.S. October 30]
1821 â€“ February 9 [O.S. January 28] 1881) is considered one of two
greatest prose writers of Russian literature, alongside close
contemporary Leo Tolstoy. Dostoevsky's works have had a profound
and lasting effect on twentieth-century thought and world
literature. Dostoevsky's chief ouevre, mainly novels, explore the
human psychology in the disturbing political, social and spiritual
context of his 19th-century Russian society. Considered by many as
a founder or precursor of 20th-century existentialism, his Notes
from Underground (1864), written in the anonymous, embittered voice
of the Underground Man, is considered by Walter Kaufmann as the
"best overture for existentialism ever written." Source:
