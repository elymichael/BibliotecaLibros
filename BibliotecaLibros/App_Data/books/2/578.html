<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>13<br/>A<br/>Corrupter of Thought<br/><br/><br/>"IT'S not only the accumulation of facts that threatens my<br/>client with ruin, gentlemen of the jury," he began, "what is really<br/>damning for my client is one fact- the dead body of his father. Had<br/>it been an ordinary case of murder you would have rejected the<br/>charge in view of the triviality, the incompleteness, and the<br/>fantastic character of the evidence, if you examine each part of it<br/>separately; or, at least, you would have hesitated to ruin a man's<br/>life simply from the prejudice against him which he has, alas! only<br/>too well deserved. But it's not an ordinary case of murder, it's a<br/>case of parricide. That impresses men's minds, and to such a degree<br/>that the very triviality and incompleteness of the evidence becomes<br/>less trivial and less incomplete even to an unprejudiced mind. How<br/>can such a prisoner be acquitted? What if he committed the murder<br/>and gets off unpunished? That is what everyone, almost<br/>involuntarily, instinctively, feels at heart.<br/><br/>"Yes, it's a fearful thing to shed a father's blood- the father<br/>who has begotten me, loved me, not spared his life for me, grieved<br/>over my illnesses from childhood up, troubled all his life for my<br/>happiness, and has lived in my joys, in my successes. To murder<br/>such a father- that's inconceivable. Gentlemen of the jury, what is<br/>a father- a real father? What is the meaning of that great word?<br/>What is the great idea in that name? We have just indicated in part<br/>what a true father is and what he ought to be. In the case in which<br/>we are now so deeply occupied and over which our hearts are aching-<br/>in the present case, the father, Fyodor Pavlovitch Karamazov, did<br/>not correspond to that conception of a father to which we have just<br/>referred. That's the misfortune. And indeed some fathers are a<br/>misfortune. Let us examine this misfortune rather more closely: we<br/>must shrink from nothing, gentlemen of the jury, considering the<br/>importance of the decision you have to make. It's our particular<br/>duty not to shrink from any idea, like children or frightened<br/>women, as the talented prosecutor happily expresses it.<br/><br/>"But in the course of his heated speech my esteemed opponent<br/>(and he was my opponent before I opened my lips) exclaimed several<br/>times, 'Oh, I will not yield the defence of the prisoner to the<br/>lawyer who has come down from Petersburg. I accuse, but I defend<br/>also!' He exclaimed that several times, but forgot to mention that<br/>if this terrible prisoner was for twenty-three years so grateful<br/>for a mere pound of nuts given him by the only man who had been<br/>kind to him, as a child in his father's house, might not such a man<br/>well have remembered for twenty-three years how he ran in his<br/>father's back-yard, without boots on his feet and with his little<br/>trousers hanging by one button'- to use the expression of the<br/>kindhearted doctor, Herzenstube?<br/><br/>"Oh, gentlemen of the jury, why need we look more closely at<br/>this misfortune, why repeat what we all know already? What did my<br/>client meet with when he arrived here, at his father's house, and<br/>why depict my client as a heartless egoist and monster? He is<br/>uncontrolled, he is wild and unruly- we are trying him now for<br/>that- but who is responsible for his life? Who is responsible for<br/>his having received such an unseemly bringing up, in spite of his<br/>excellent disposition and his grateful and sensitive heart? Did<br/>anyone train him to be reasonable? Was he enlightened by study? Did<br/>anyone love him ever so little in his childhood? My client was left<br/>to the care of Providence like a beast of the field. He thirsted<br/>perhaps to see his father after long years of separation. A<br/>thousand times perhaps he may, recalling his childhood, have driven<br/>away the loathsome phantoms that haunted his childish dreams and<br/>with all his heart he may have longed to embrace and to forgive his<br/>father! And what awaited him? He was met by cynical taunts,<br/>suspicions and wrangling about money. He heard nothing but<br/>revolting talk and vicious precepts uttered daily over the brandy,<br/>and at last he saw his father seducing his mistress from him with<br/>his own money. Oh, gentlemen of the jury, that was cruel and<br/>revolting! And that old man was always complaining of the<br/>disrespect and cruelty of his son. He slandered him in society,<br/>injured him, calumniated him, bought up his unpaid debts to get him<br/>thrown into prison.<br/><br/>"Gentlemen of the jury, people like my client, who are fierce,<br/>unruly, and uncontrolled on the surface, are sometimes, most<br/>frequently indeed, exceedingly tender-hearted, only they don't<br/>express it. Don't laugh, don't laugh at my idea! The talented<br/>prosecutor laughed mercilessly just now at my client for loving<br/>Schiller- loving the sublime and beautiful! I should not have<br/>laughed at that in his place. Yes, such natures- oh, let me speak<br/>in defence of such natures, so often and so cruelly misunderstood-<br/>these natures often thirst for tenderness, goodness, and justice,<br/>as it were, in contrast to themselves, their unruliness, their<br/>ferocity- they thirst for it unconsciously. Passionate and fierce<br/>on the surface, they are painfully capable of loving woman, for<br/>instance, and with a spiritual and elevated love. Again do not<br/>laugh at me, this is very often the case in such natures. But they<br/>cannot hide their passions- sometimes very coarse- and that is<br/>conspicuous and is noticed, but the inner man is unseen. Their<br/>passions are quickly exhausted; but, by the side of a noble and<br/>lofty creature that seemingly coarse and rough man seeks a new<br/>life, seeks to correct himself, to be better, to become noble and<br/>honourable, 'sublime and beautiful,' however much the expression<br/>has been ridiculed.<br/><br/>"I said just now that I would not venture to touch upon my<br/>client's engagement. But I may say half a word. What we heard just<br/>now was not evidence, but only the scream of a frenzied and<br/>revengeful woman, and it was not for her- oh, not for her!- to<br/>reproach him with treachery, for she has betrayed him! If she had<br/>had but a little time for reflection she would not have given such<br/>evidence. Oh, do not believe her! No, my client is not a monster,<br/>as she called him!<br/><br/>"The Lover of Mankind on the eve of His Crucifixion said: 'I am<br/>the Good Shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for his<br/>sheep, so that not one of them might be lost.' Let not a man's soul<br/>be lost through us!<br/>
