"Good Lord!" I thought to myself, "he is thinking of other<br/>people's respect at such a moment!" And I felt so sorry for him<br/>then, that I believe I would have shared his fate if it could have<br/>comforted him. I saw he was beside himself. I was aghast, realising<br/>with my heart as well as my mind what such a resolution meant.<br/><br/>"Decide my fate!" he exclaimed again.<br/><br/>"Go and confess," I whispered to him. My voice failed me, but I<br/>whispered it firmly. I took up the New Testament from the table,<br/>the Russian translation, and showed him the Gospel of St. John,<br/>chapter 12, verse 24:<br/><br/>"Verily, verily, I say unto you,<br/><br/>except a corn of wheat fall into<br/><br/>the ground and die, it abideth alone:<br/><br/>but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit."<br/><br/>I had just been reading that verse when he came in. He read<br/>it.<br/><br/>"That's true," he said, he smiled bitterly. "It's terrible the<br/>things you find in those books," he said, after a pause. "It's easy<br/>enough to thrust them upon one. And who wrote them? Can they have<br/>been written by men?"<br/><br/>"The Holy Spirit wrote them," said I.<br/><br/>"It's easy for you to prate," he smiled again, this time almost<br/>with hatred.<br/>
