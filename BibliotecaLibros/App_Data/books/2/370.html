<br/>"We have seen your handkerchief. Did you hope to restore him to<br/>consciousness?"<br/><br/>"I don't know whether I hoped it. I simply wanted to make sure<br/>whether he was alive or not."<br/><br/>"Ah! You wanted to be sure? Well, what then?"<br/><br/>"I'm not a doctor. I couldn't decide. I ran away thinking I'd<br/>killed him. And now he's recovered."<br/><br/>"Excellent," commented the prosecutor. "Thank you. That's all I<br/>wanted. Kindly proceed."<br/><br/>Alas! it never entered Mitya's head to tell them, though he<br/>remembered it, that he had jumped back from pity, and standing over<br/>the prostrate figure had even uttered some words of regret: "You've<br/>come to grief, old man- there's no help for it. Well, there you<br/>must lie."<br/><br/>The prosecutor could only draw one conclusion: that the man had<br/>jumped back "at such a moment and in such excitement simply with<br/>the object of ascertaining whether the only witness of his crime<br/>were dead; that he must therefore have been a man of great<br/>strength, coolness, decision, and foresight even at such a<br/>moment,"â€¦ and so on. The prosecutor was satisfied: "I've provoked<br/>the nervous fellow by 'trifles' and he has said more than he meant<br/>With painful effort Mitya went on. But this time he was pulled up<br/>immediately by Nikolay Parfenovitch.<br/><br/>"How came you to run to the servant, Fedosya Markovna, with your<br/>hands so covered with blood, and, as it appears, your face,<br/>too?"<br/><br/>"Why, I didn't notice the blood at all at the time," answered<br/>Mitya.<br/><br/>"That's quite likely. It does happen sometimes." The prosecutor<br/>exchanged glances with Nikolay Parfenovitch.<br/><br/>
