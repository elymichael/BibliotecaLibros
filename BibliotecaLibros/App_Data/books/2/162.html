"Very well, Lise, I'll look; but wouldn't it be better not to<br/>look? Why suspect your mother of such meanness?"<br/><br/>"What meanness? As for her spying on her daughter, it's her<br/>right, it's not meanness!" cried Lise, firing up. "You may be sure,<br/>Alexey Fyodorovitch, that when I am a mother, if I have a daughter<br/>like myself I shall certainly spy on her!"<br/><br/>"Really, Lise? That's not right."<br/><br/>"Oh, my goodness! What has meanness to do with it? If she were<br/>listening to some ordinary worldly conversation, it would be<br/>meanness, but when her own daughter is shut up with a young man…<br/>Listen, Alyosha, do you know I shall spy upon you as soon as we are<br/>married, and let me tell you I shall open all your letters and read<br/>them, so you may as well be prepared."<br/><br/>"Yes, of course, if so- " muttered Alyosha, "only it's not<br/>right."<br/><br/>"Ah, how contemptuous! Alyosha, dear, we won't quarrel the very<br/>first day. I'd better tell you the whole truth. Of course, it's<br/>very wrong to spy on people, and, of course, I am not right and you<br/>are, only I shall spy on you all the same."<br/><br/>"Do, then; you won't find out anything," laughed Alyosha.<br/><br/>"And Alyosha, will you give in to me? We must decide that<br/>too."<br/><br/>"I shall be delighted to, Lise, and certain to, only not in the<br/>most important things. Even if you don't agree with me, I shall do<br/>my duty in the most important things."<br/><br/>"That's right; but let me tell you I am ready to give in to you<br/>not only in the most important matters, but in everything. And I am<br/>ready to vow to do so now- in everything, and for all my life!"<br/>cried Lise fervently, "and I'll do it gladly, gladly! What's more,<br/>I'll swear never to spy on you, never once, never to read one of<br/>your letters. For you are right and I am not. And though I shall be<br/>awfully tempted to spy, I know that I won't do it since you<br/>consider it dishonourable. You are my conscience now… . Listen,<br/>Alexey Fyodorovitch, why have you been so sad lately- both<br/>yesterday and to-day? I know you have a lot of anxiety and trouble,<br/>but I see you have some special grief besides, some secret one,<br/>perhaps?"<br/><br/>"Yes, Lise, I have a secret one, too," answered Alyosha<br/>mournfully. "I see you love me, since you guessed that."<br/>
