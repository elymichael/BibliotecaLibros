Precocity


"WHAT do you think the doctor will say to him?" Kolya asked
quickly. "What a repulsive mug, though, hasn't he? I can't endure
medicine!"

"Ilusha is dying. I think that's certain," answered Alyosha,
mournfully.

"They are rogues! Medicine's a fraud! I am glad to have made
your acquaintance, though, Karamazov. I wanted to know you for a
long time. I am only sorry we meet in such sad circumstances."

Kolya had a great inclination to say something even warmer and
more demonstrative, but he felt ill at ease. Alyosha noticed this,
smiled, and pressed his hand.

"I've long learned to respect you as a rare person," Kolya
muttered again, faltering and uncertain. "I have heard you are a
mystic and have been in the monastery. I know you are a mystic,
but… that hasn't put me off. Contact with real life will cure you…
. It's always so with characters like yours."

"What do you mean by mystic? Cure me of what?" Alyosha was
rather astonished.

"Oh, God and all the rest of it."
