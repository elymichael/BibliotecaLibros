<br/>"What is it again?" Father Zossima asked, smiling gently. "The<br/>worldly may follow the dead with tears, but here we rejoice over<br/>the father who is departing. We rejoice and pray for him. Leave me,<br/>I must pray. Go, and make haste. Be near your brothers. And not<br/>near one only, but near both."<br/><br/>Father Zossima raised his hand to bless him. Alyosha could make<br/>no protest, though he had a great longing to remain. He longed,<br/>moreover, to ask the significance of his bowing to Dmitri, the<br/>question was on the tip of his tongue, but he dared not ask it. He<br/>knew that the elder would have explained it unasked if he had<br/>thought fit. But evidently it was not his will. That action had<br/>made a terrible impression on Alyosha; he believed blindly in its<br/>mysterious significance. Mysterious, and perhaps awful.<br/><br/>As he hastened out of the hermatage precincts to reach the<br/>monastery in time to serve at the Father Superior's dinner, he felt<br/>a sudden pang at his heart, and stopped short. He seemed to hear<br/>again Father Zossima's words, foretelling his approaching end. What<br/>he had foretold so exactly must infallibly come to pass. Alyosha<br/>believed that implicitly. But how could he go? He had told him not<br/>to weep, and to leave the monastery. Good God! It was long since<br/>Alyosha had known such anguish. He hurried through the copse that<br/>divided the monastery from the hermitage, and unable to bear the<br/>burden of his thoughts, he gazed at the ancient pines beside the<br/>path. He had not far to go- about five hundred paces. He expected<br/>to meet no one at that hour, but at the first turn of the path he<br/>noticed Rakitin. He was waiting for someone.<br/><br/>"Are you waiting for me?" asked Alyosha, overtaking him.<br/><br/>"Yes," grinned Rakitin. "You are hurrying to the Father<br/>Superior, I know; he has a banquet. There's not been such a banquet<br/>since the Superior entertained the Bishop and General Pahatov, do<br/>you remember? I shan't be there, but you go and hand the sauces.<br/>Tell me one thing, Alexey, what does that vision mean? That's what<br/>I want to ask you."<br/><br/>"What vision?"<br/><br/>"That bowing to your brother, Dmitri. And didn't he tap the<br/>ground with his forehead, too!"<br/><br/>"You speak of Father Zossima?"<br/><br/>"Yes, of Father Zossima,"<br/><br/>"Tapped the ground?"<br/><br/>
