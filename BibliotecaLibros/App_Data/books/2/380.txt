"Here are clothes for you," he observed airily, seeming well
satisfied with the success of his mission. "Mr. Kalganov has kindly
provided these for this unusual emergency, as well as a clean
shirt. Luckily he had them all in his trunk. You can keep your own
socks and underclothes."

Mitya flew into a passion.

"I won't have other people's clothes!" he shouted menacingly,
"give me my own!"

"It's impossible!"

"Give me my own. Damn Kalganov and his clothes, too!"

It was a long time before they could persuade him. But they
succeeded somehow in quieting him down. They impressed upon him
that his clothes, being stained with blood, must be "included with
the other material evidence," and that they "had not even the right
to let him have them now… taking into consideration the possible
outcome of the case." Mitya at last understood this. He subsided
into gloomy silence and hurriedly dressed himself. He merely
observed, as he put them on, that the clothes were much better than
his old ones, and that he disliked "gaining by the change." The
coat was, besides, "ridiculously tight. Am I to be dressed up like
a fool… for your amusement?"

They urged upon him again that he was exaggerating, that
Kalganov was only a little taller, so that only the trousers might
be a little too long. But the coat turned out to be really tight in
the shoulders.

"Damn it all! I can hardly button it," Mitya grumbled. "Be so
good as to tell Mr. Kalganov from me that I didn't ask for his
clothes, and it's not my doing that they've dressed me up like a
clown."

"He understands that, and is sorry… I mean, not sorry to lend
you his clothes, but sorry about all this business," mumbled
Nikolay Parfenovitch.

"Confound his sorrow! Well, where now? Am I to go on sitting
here?"
