a row with the man. But he had been in so many rows in the street

your saucy pranks again? I know, you are at it again!"

"It's not your business, brother, if I am at my saucy pranks
again," said Kolya, standing still and scanning him.

"Not my business?"

"No; it's not your business."

"Whose then? Whose then? Whose then?"

"It's Trifon Nikititch's business, not yours."
