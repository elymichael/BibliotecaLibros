"Let me tell you," she said, "that I am the first not to laugh<br/>at you, but on the contrary I thank you with tears and express my<br/>respect for you for your action then."<br/><br/>Her husband, too, came up and then they all approached me and<br/>almost kissed me. My heart was filled with joy, but my attention<br/>was especially caught by a middle-aged man who came up to me with<br/>the others. I knew him by name already, but had never made his<br/>acquaintance nor exchanged a word with him till that evening.<br/><br/>(d) The Mysterious Visitor.<br/><br/>He had long been an official in the town; he was in a prominent<br/>position, respected by all, rich and had a reputation for<br/>benevolence. He subscribed considerable sums to the almshouse and<br/>the orphan asylum; he was very charitable, too, in secret, a fact<br/>which only became known after his death. He was a man of about<br/>fifty, almost stern in appearance and not much given to<br/>conversation. He had been married about ten years and his wife, who<br/>was still young, had borne him three children. Well, I was sitting<br/>alone in my room the following evening, when my door suddenly<br/>opened and this gentleman walked in.<br/><br/>I must mention, by the way, that I was no longer living in my<br/>former quarters. As soon as I resigned my commission, I took rooms<br/>with an old lady, the widow of a government clerk. My landlady's<br/>servant waited upon me, for I had moved into her rooms simply<br/>because on my return from the duel I had sent Afanasy back to the<br/>regiment, as I felt ashamed to look him in the face after my last<br/>interview with him. So prone is the man of the world to be ashamed<br/>of any righteous action.<br/><br/>"I have," said my visitor, "with great interest listened to you<br/>speaking in different houses the last few days and I wanted at last<br/>to make your personal acquaintance, so as to talk to you more<br/>intimately. Can you, dear sir, grant me this favour?"<br/><br/>"I can, with the greatest pleasure, and I shall look upon it as<br/>an honour." I said this, though I felt almost dismayed, so greatly<br/>was I impressed from the first moment by the appearance of this<br/>man. For though other people had listened to me with interest and<br/>attention, no one had come to me before with such a serious, stern,<br/>and concentrated expression. And now he had come to see me in my<br/>own rooms. He sat down.<br/><br/>"You are, I see, a man of great strength of character" he said;<br/>"as you have dared to serve the truth, even when by doing so you<br/>risked incurring the contempt of all."<br/><br/>"Your praise is, perhaps, excessive," I replied.<br/><br/>"No, it's not excessive," he answered; "believe me, such a<br/>course of action is far more difficult than you think. It is that<br/>which has impressed me, and it is only on that account that I have<br/>come to you," he continued. "Tell me, please, that is if you are<br/>not annoyed by my perhaps unseemly curiosity, what were your exact<br/>sensations, if you can recall them, at the moment when you made up<br/>your mind to ask forgiveness at the duel. Do not think my question<br/>frivolous; on the contrary, I have in asking the question a secret<br/>motive of my own, which I will perhaps explain to you later on, if<br/>it is God's will that we should become more intimately<br/>acquainted."<br/><br/>All the while he was speaking, I was looking at him straight<br/>into the face and I felt all at once a complete trust in him and<br/>great curiosity on my side also, for I felt that there was some<br/>strange secret in his soul.<br/>
