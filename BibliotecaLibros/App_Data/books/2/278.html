<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>4<br/>In<br/>the Dark<br/><br/><br/>WHERE was he running? "Where could she be except at Fyodor<br/>Pavlovitch's? She must have run straight to him from Samsonov's,<br/>that was clear now. The whole intrigue, the whole deceit was<br/>evident."… It all rushed whirling through his mind. He did not run<br/>to Marya Kondratyevna's. "There was no need to go there… not the<br/>slightest need… he must raise no alarm… they would run and tell<br/>directly… . Marya Kondratyevna was clearly in the plot, Smerdyakov<br/>too, he too, all had been bought over!"<br/><br/>He formed another plan of action: he ran a long way round Fyodor<br/>Pavlovitch's house, crossing the lane, running down Dmitrovsky<br/>Street, then over the little bridge, and so came straight to the<br/>deserted alley at the back, which was empty and uninhabited, with,<br/>on one side the hurdle fence of a neighbour's kitchen-garden, on<br/>the other the strong high fence that ran all round Fyodor<br/>Pavlovitch's garden. Here he chose a spot, apparently the very<br/>place, where according to the tradition, he knew Lizaveta had once<br/>climbed over it: "If she could climb over it," the thought, God<br/>knows why, occurred to him, "surely I can." He did in fact jump up,<br/>and instantly contrived to catch hold of the top of the fence. Then<br/>he vigorously pulled himself up and sat astride on it. Close by, in<br/>the garden stood the bathhouse, but from the fence he could see the<br/>lighted windows of the house too.<br/><br/>"Yes, the old man's bedroom is lighted up. She's there! and he<br/>leapt from the fence into the garden. Though he knew Grigory was<br/>ill and very likely Smerdyakov, too, and that there was no one to<br/>hear him, he instinctively hid himself, stood still, and began to<br/>listen. But there was dead silence on all sides and, as though of<br/>design, complete stillness, not the slightest breath of wind.<br/><br/>"And naught but the whispering silence," the line for some<br/>reason rose to his mind. "If only no one heard me jump over the<br/>fence! I think not." Standing still for a minute, he walked softly<br/>over the grass in the garden, avoiding the trees and shrubs. He<br/>walked slowly, creeping stealthily at every step, listening to his<br/>own footsteps. It took him five minutes to reach the lighted<br/>window. He remembered that just under the window there were several<br/>thick and high bushes of elder and whitebeam. The door from the<br/>house into the garden on the left-hand side was shut; he had<br/>carefully looked on purpose to see, in passing. At last he reached<br/>the bushes and hid behind them. He held his breath. "I must wait<br/>now," he thought, "to reassure them, in case they heard my<br/>footsteps and are listening… if only I don't cough or sneeze."<br/><br/>He waited two minutes. His heart was beating violently, and, at<br/>moments, he could scarcely breathe. "No, this throbbing at my heart<br/>won't stop," he thought. "I can't wait any longer." He was standing<br/>behind a bush in the shadow. The light of the window fell on the<br/>front part of the bush.<br/><br/>"How red the whitebeam berries are!" he murmured, not knowing<br/>why. Softly and noiselessly, step by step, he approached the<br/>window, and raised himself on tiptoe. All Fyodor Pavlovitch's<br/>bedroom lay open before him. It was not a large room, and was<br/>divided in two parts by a red screen, "Chinese," as Fyodor<br/>Pavlovitch used to call it. The word "Chinese" flashed into Mitya's<br/>mind, "and behind the screen, is Grushenka," thought Mitya. He<br/>began watching Fyodor Pavlovitch who was wearing his new<br/>striped-silk dressing-gown, which Mitya had never seen, and a silk<br/>cord with tassels round the waist. A clean, dandified shirt of fine<br/>linen with gold studs peeped out under the collar of the<br/>dressing-gown. On his head Fyodor Pavlovitch had the same red<br/>bandage which Alyosha had seen.<br/><br/>"He has got himself up," thought Mitya.<br/>
