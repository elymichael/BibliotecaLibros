"And was it like this in the time of the last elder, Varsonofy?
He didn't care for such elegance. They say he used to jump up and
thrash even ladies with a stick," observed Fyodor Pavlovitch, as he
went up the steps.

"The elder Varsonofy did sometimes seem rather strange, but a
great deal that's told is foolishness. He never thrashed anyone,"
answered the monk. "Now, gentlemen, if you will wait a minute I
will announce you."

"Fyodor Pavlovitch, for the last time, your compact, do you
hear? Behave properly or I will pay you out!" Miusov had time to
mutter again.

"I can't think why you are so agitated," Fyodor Pavlovitch
observed sarcastically. "Are you uneasy about your sins? They say
he can tell by one's eyes what one has come about. And what a lot
you think of their opinion! you, a Parisian, and so advanced. I'm
surprised at you."

But Miusov had no time to reply to this sarcasm. They were asked
to come in. He walked in, somewhat irritated.

"Now, I know myself, I am annoyed, I shall lose my temper and
begin to quarrel- and lower myself and my ideas," he reflected.
