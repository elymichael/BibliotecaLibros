<br/>"Yes, that's really true," Rakitin put in suddenly with genuine<br/>surprise. "Alyosha, she is really afraid of a chicken like<br/>you."<br/><br/>"He is a chicken to you, Rakitin… because you've no conscience,<br/>that's what it is! You see, I love him with all my soul, that's how<br/>it is! Alyosha, do you believe I love you with all my soul?"<br/><br/>"Ah, you shameless woman! She is making you a declaration,<br/>Alexey!"<br/><br/>"Well, what of it, I love him!"<br/><br/>"And what about your officer? And the priceless message from<br/>Mokroe?"<br/><br/>"That is quite different."<br/><br/>"That's a woman's way of looking at it!"<br/><br/>"Don't you make me angry, Rakitin." Grushenka caught him up<br/>hotly. "This is quite different. I love Alyosha in a different way.<br/>It's true, Alyosha, I had sly designs on you before. For I am a<br/>horrid, violent creature.

I thought that the day before<br/>yesterday, as I ran home from the young lady's. I have thought of<br/>you a long time in that way, Alyosha, and Mitya knows; I've talked<br/>to him about it. Mitya understands. Would you believe it, I<br/>sometimes look at you and feel ashamed, utterly ashamed of myself…<br/>. And how, and since when, I began to think about you like that, I<br/>can't say, I don't remember… ."<br/><br/>Fenya came in and put a tray with an uncorked bottle and three<br/>glasses of champagne on the table.<br/><br/>"Here's the champagne!" cried Rakitin. "You're excited, Agrafena<br/>Alexandrovna, and not yourself. When you've had a glass of<br/>champagne, you'll be ready to dance. Eh, they can't even do that<br/>properly," he added, looking at the bottle. "The old woman's poured<br/>it out in the kitchen and the bottle's been brought in warm and<br/>without a cork. Well, let me have some, anyway."<br/><br/>
