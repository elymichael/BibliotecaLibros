<br/>"Nonsense! It's absurd! I'd no idea it was under the pillow. And<br/>perhaps it wasn't under the pillow at all… . It was just a chance<br/>guess that it was under the pillow. What does Smerdyakov say? Have<br/>you asked him where it was? What does Smerdyakov say? That's the<br/>chief point… . And I went out of my way to tell lies against<br/>myself… . I told you without thinking that it was under the pillow,<br/>and now you- Oh, you know how one says the wrong thing, without<br/>meaning it. No one knew but Smerdyakov, only Smerdyakov, and no one<br/>else… . He didn't even tell me where it was! But it's his doing,<br/>his doing; there's no doubt about it, he murdered him, that's as<br/>clear as daylight now," Mitya exclaimed more and more frantically,<br/>repeating himself incoherently, and growing more and more<br/>exasperated and excited. "You must understand that, and arrest him<br/>at once… . He must have killed him while I was running away and<br/>while Grigory was unconscious, that's clear now… . He gave the<br/>signal and father opened to him… for no one but he knew the signal,<br/>and without the signal father would never have opened the door…<br/>."<br/><br/>"But you're again forgetting the circumstance," the prosecutor<br/>observed, still speaking with the same restraint, though with a<br/>note of triumph, "that there was no need to give the signal if the<br/>door already stood open when you were there, while you were in the<br/>garden… "<br/><br/>"The door, the door," muttered Mitya, and he stared speechless<br/>at the prosecutor. He sank back helpless in his chair. All were<br/>silent.<br/><br/>"Yes, the door!… It's a nightmare! God is against me!" he<br/>exclaimed, staring before him in complete stupefaction.<br/><br/>"Come, you see," the prosecutor went on with dignity, "and you<br/>can judge for yourself, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. On the one hand, we<br/>have the evidence of the open door from which you ran out, a fact<br/>which overwhelms you and us. On the other side, your<br/>incomprehensible, persistent, and, so to speak, obdurate silence<br/>with regard to the source from which you obtained the money which<br/>was so suddenly seen in your hands, when only three hours earlier,<br/>on your own showing, you pledged your pistols for the sake of ten<br/>roubles! In view of all these facts, judge for yourself. What are<br/>we to believe, and what can we depend upon? And don't accuse us of<br/>being 'frigid, cynical, scoffing people,' who are incapable of<br/>believing in the generous impulses of your heart… . Try to enter<br/>into our position… "<br/><br/>Mitya was indescribably agitated. He turned pale.<br/><br/>"Very well!" he exclaimed suddenly, "I will tell you my secret.<br/>I'll tell you where I got the money!… I'll reveal my shame, that I<br/>may not have to blame myself or you hereafter."<br/><br/>"And believe me, Dmitri Fyodorovitch," put in Nikolay<br/>Parfenovitch, in a voice of almost pathetic delight, "that every<br/>sincere and complete confession on your part at this moment may,<br/>later on, have an immense influence in your favour, and may,<br/>indeed, moreover-"<br/><br/>But the prosecutor gave him a slight shove under the table, and<br/>he checked himself in time. Mitya, it is true, had not heard<br/>him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>
