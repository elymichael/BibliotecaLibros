"You ask what were my exact sensations at the moment when I
asked my opponent's forgiveness," I answered; "but I had better
tell you from the beginning what I have not yet told anyone else."
And I described all that had passed between Afanasy and me, and how
I had bowed down to the ground at his feet. "From that you can see
for yourself," I concluded, "that at the time of the duel it was
easier for me, for I had made a beginning already at home, and when
once I had started on that road, to go farther along it was far
from being difficult, but became a source of joy and
happiness."

I liked the way he looked at me as he listened. "All that," he
said, "is exceedingly interesting. I will come to see you again and
again."

And from that time forth he came to see me nearly every evening.
And we should have become greater friends, if only he had ever
talked of himself. But about himself he scarcely ever said a word,
yet continually asked me about myself. In spite of that I became
very fond of him and spoke with perfect frankness to him about all
my feelings; "for," thought I, "what need have I to know his
secrets, since I can see without that that is a good man? Moreover,
though he is such a serious man and my senior, he comes to see a
youngster like me and treats me as his equal." And I learned a
great deal that was profitable from him, for he was a man of lofty
mind.

"That life is heaven," he said to me suddenly, "that I have long
been thinking about"; and all at once he added, "I think of nothing
else indeed." He looked at me and smiled. "I am more convinced of
it than you are, I will tell you later why."

I listened to him and thought that he evidently wanted to tell
me something.

"Heaven," he went on, "lies hidden within all of us- here it
lies hidden in me now, and if I will it, it will be revealed to me
to-morrow and for all time."

I looked at him; he was speaking with great emotion and gazing
mysteriously at me, as if he were questioning me.

"And that we are all responsible to all for all, apart from our
own sins, you were quite right in thinking that, and it is
wonderful how you could comprehend it in all its significance at
once. And in very truth, so soon as men understand that, the
Kingdom of Heaven will be for them not a dream, but a living
reality."

"And when," I cried out to him bitterly, "when will that come to
pass? and will it ever come to pass? Is not it simply a dream of
ours?"

"What then, you don't believe it," he said. "You preach it and
don't believe it yourself. Believe me, this dream, as you call it,
will come to pass without doubt; it will come, but not now, for
every process has its law. It's a spiritual, psychological process.
To transform the world, to recreate it afresh, men must turn into
another path psychologically. Until you have become really, in
actual fact, a brother to everyone, brotherhood will not come to
pass. No sort of scientific teaching, no kind of common interest,
will ever teach men to share property and privileges with equal
consideration for all. Everyone will think his share too small and
they will be always envying, complaining and attacking one another.
You ask when it will come to pass; it will come to pass, but first
we have to go though the period of isolation."
