<br/>"You know of yourself, for a fact, that it wasn't I murdered<br/>him. And I should have thought that there was no need for a<br/>sensible man to speak of it again."<br/><br/>"But why, why had you such a suspicion about me at the<br/>time?"<br/><br/>"As you know already, it was simply from fear. For I was in such<br/>a position, shaking with fear, that I suspected everyone. I<br/>resolved to sound you, too, for I thought if you wanted the same as<br/>your brother, then the business was as good as settled and I should<br/>be crushed like a fly, too."<br/><br/>"Look here, you didn't say that a fortnight ago."<br/><br/>"I meant the same when I talked to you in the hospital, only I<br/>thought you'd understand without wasting words, and that being such<br/>a sensible man you wouldn't care to talk of it openly."<br/><br/>"What next! Come answer, answer, I insist: what was itâ€¦ what<br/>could I have done to put such a degrading suspicion into your mean<br/>soul?"<br/><br/>"As for the murder, you couldn't have done that and didn't want<br/>to, but as for wanting someone else to do it, that was just what<br/>you did want."<br/><br/>"And how coolly, how coolly he speakst But why should I have<br/>wanted it; what grounds had I for wanting it?"<br/><br/>"What grounds had you? What about the inheritance?" said<br/>Smerdyakov sarcastically, and, as it were, vindictively. "Why,<br/>after your parent's death there was at least forty thousand to come<br/>to each of you, and very likely more, but if Fyodor Pavlovitch got<br/>married then to that lady, Agrafena Alexandrovna, she would have<br/>had all his capital made over to her directly after the wedding,<br/>for she's plenty of sense, so that your parent would not have left<br/>you two roubles between the three of you. And were they far from a<br/>wedding, either? Not a hair's-breadth: that lady had only to lift<br/>her little finger and he would have run after her to church, with<br/>his tongue out."<br/><br/>Ivan restrained himself with painful effort.<br/><br/>
