"I not only say it, I shall do it."

"I believe you."

"Ah, how I love you for saying you believe me. And you are not
lying one little bit. But perhaps you think that I am saying all
this on purpose to annoy you?"

"No, I don't think thatâ€¦ though perhaps there is a little desire
to do that in it, too."

"There is a little. I never can tell lies to you," she declared,

What struck Alyosha above everything was her earnestness. There
was not a trace of humour or jesting in her face now, though, in
old days, fun and gaiety never deserted her even at her most
"earnest" moments.

"There are moments when people love crime," said Alyosha
thoughtfully.

"Yes, yes! You have uttered my thought; they love crime,
everyone loves crime, they love it always, not at some 'moments.'
You know, it's as though people have made an agreement to lie about
it and have lied about it ever since. They all declare that they
hate evil, but secretly they all love it."

"And are you still reading nasty books?"

"Yes, I am. Mamma reads them and hides them under her pillow and
I steal them."

"Aren't you ashamed to destroy yourself?"
