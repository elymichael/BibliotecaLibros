"I want to destroy myself. There's a boy here, who lay down
between the railway lines when the train was passing. Lucky fellow!
Listen, your brother is being tried now for murdering his father
and everyone loves his having killed his father."

"Loves his having killed his father?"

"Yes, loves it; everyone loves it! Everybody says it's so awful,
but secretly they simply love it. I for one love it."

"There is some truth in what you say about everyone," said
Alyosha softly.

"Oh, what ideas you have!" Lise shrieked in delight. "And you a
monk, too! You wouldn't believe how I respect you, Alyosha, for
never telling lies. Oh, I must tell you a funny dream of mine. I
sometimes dream of devils. It's night; I am in my room with a
candle and suddenly there are devils all over the place, in all the
corners, under the table, and they open the doors; there's a crowd
of them behind the doors and they want to come and seize me. And
they are just coming, just seizing me. But I suddenly cross myself
and they all draw back, though they don't go away altogether, they
stand at the doors and in the corners, waiting. And suddenly I have
a frightful longing to revile God aloud, and so I begin, and then
they come crowding back to me, delighted, and seize me again and I
cross myself again and they all draw back. It's awful fun, it takes
one's breath away."

"I've had the same dream, too," said Alyosha suddenly.

"Really?" cried Lise, surprised. "I say, Alyosha, don't laugh,
that's awfully important. Could two different people have the same
dream?"

"It seems they can."

"Alyosha, I tell you, it's awfully important," Lise went on,
with really excessive amazement. "It's not the dream that's
important, but your having the same dream as me. You never lie to
me, don't lie now; is it true? You are not laughing?"

"It's true."
