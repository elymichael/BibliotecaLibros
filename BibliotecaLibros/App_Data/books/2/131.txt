"What's wrong with him?" asked Alyosha, "Is he a tell-tale or
what?"

The boys looked at one another as though derisively.

"Are you going that way, to Mihailovsky?" the same boy went on.
"Catch him upâ€¦ . You see he's stopped again, he is waiting and
looking at you."

"He is looking at you," the other boys chimed in.

"You ask him, does he like a dishevelled wisp of tow. Do you
hear, ask him that!"

There was a general burst of laughter. Alyosha looked at them,
and they at him.

"Don't go near him, he'll hurt you," cried Smurov in a warning
voice.

"I shan't ask him about the wisp of tow, for I expect you tease
him with that question somehow. But I'll find out from him why you
hate him so."

"Find out then, find out," cried the boys laughing.

Alyosha crossed the bridge and walked uphill by the fence,
straight towards the boy.

"You'd better look out," the boys called after him; "he won't be
afraid of you. He will stab you in a minute, on the sly, as he did
Krassotkin."
