<br/>When the servants came in to him he would say continually,<br/>"Dear, kind people, why are you doing so much for me, do I deserve<br/>to be waited on? If it were God's will for me to live, I would wait<br/>on you, for all men should wait on one another."<br/><br/>Mother shook her head as she listened. "My darling, it's your<br/>illness makes you talk like that."<br/><br/>"Mother darling," he would say, "there must be servants and<br/>masters, but if so I will be the servant of my servants, the same<br/>as they are to me. And another thing, mother, every one of us has<br/>sinned against all men, and I more than any."<br/><br/>Mother positively smiled at that, smiled through her tears.<br/>"Why, how could you have sinned against all men, more than all?<br/>Robbers and murderers have done that, but what sin have you<br/>committed yet, that you hold yourself more guilty than all?"<br/><br/>"Mother, little heart of mine," he said (he had begun using such<br/>strange caressing words at that time), "little heart of mine, my<br/>joy, believe me, everyone is really responsible to all men for all<br/>men and for everything. I don't know how to explain it to you, but<br/>I feel it is so, painfully even. And how is it we went on then<br/>living, getting angry and not knowing?"<br/><br/>So he would get up every day, more and more sweet and joyous and<br/>full of love. When the doctor, an old German called Eisenschmidt,<br/>came:<br/><br/>"Well, doctor, have I another day in this world?" he would ask,<br/>joking.<br/><br/>"You'll live many days yet," the doctor would answer, "and<br/>months and years too."<br/><br/>"Months and years!" he would exclaim. "Why reckon the days? One<br/>day is enough for a man to know all happiness. My dear ones, why do<br/>we quarrel, try to outshine each other and keep grudges against<br/>each other? Let's go straight into the garden, walk and play there,<br/>love, appreciate, and kiss each other, and glorify life."<br/><br/>"Your son cannot last long," the doctor told my mother, as she<br/>accompanied him the door. "The disease is affecting his brain."<br/><br/>
