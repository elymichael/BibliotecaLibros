<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>7<br/>"It's Always Worth While Speaking to a Clever Man"<br/><br/><br/>AND in the same nervous frenzy, too, he spoke. Meeting Fyodor<br/>Pavlovitch in the drawing-room directly he went in, he shouted to<br/>him, waving his hands, "I am going upstairs to my room, not in to<br/>you. Good-bye!" and passed by, trying not even to look at his<br/>father. Very possibly the old man was too hateful to him at that<br/>moment; but such an unceremonious display of hostility was a<br/>surprise even to Fyodor Pavlovitch. And the old man evidently<br/>wanted to tell him something at once and had come to meet him in<br/>the drawing-room on purpose. Receiving this amiable greeting, he<br/>stood still in silence and with an ironical air watched his son<br/>going upstairs, till he passed out of sight.<br/><br/>"What's the matter with him?" he promptly asked Smerdyakov, who<br/>had followed Ivan.<br/><br/>"Angry about something. Who can tell?" the valet muttered<br/>evasively.<br/><br/>"Confound him! Let him be angry then. Bring in the samovar, and<br/>get along with you. Look sharp! No news?"<br/><br/>Then followed a series of questions such as Smerdyakov had just<br/>complained of to Ivan, all relating to his expected visitor, and<br/>these questions we will omit. Half an hour later the house was<br/>locked, and the crazy old man was wandering along through the rooms<br/>in excited expectation of hearing every minute the five knocks<br/>agreed upon. Now and then he peered out into the darkness, seeing<br/>nothing.<br/><br/>It was very late, but Ivan was still awake and reflecting. He<br/>sat up late that night, till two o'clock. But we will not give an<br/>account of his thoughts, and this is not the place to look into<br/>that soul- its turn will come. And even if one tried, it would be<br/>very hard to give an account of them, for there were no thoughts in<br/>his brain, but something very vague, and, above all, intense<br/>excitement. He felt himself that he had lost his bearings. He was<br/>fretted, too, by all sorts of strange and almost surprising<br/>desires; for instance, after midnight he suddenly had an intense<br/>irresistible inclination to go down, open the door, go to the lodge<br/>and beat Smerdyakov. But if he had been asked why, he could not<br/>have given any exact reason, except perhaps that he loathed the<br/>valet as one who had insulted him more gravely than anyone in the<br/>world. On the other hand, he was more than once that night overcome<br/>by a sort of inexplicable humiliating terror, which he felt<br/>positively paralysed his physical powers. His head ached and he was<br/>giddy. A feeling of hatred was rankling in his heart, as though he<br/>meant to avenge himself on someone. He even hated Alyosha,<br/>recalling the conversation he had just had with him. At moments he<br/>hated himself intensely. Of Katerina Ivanovna he almost forgot to<br/>think, and wondered greatly at this afterwards, especially as he<br/>remembered perfectly that when he had protested so valiantly to<br/>Katerina Ivanovna that he would go away next day to Moscow,<br/>something had whispered in his heart, "That's nonsense, you are not<br/>going, and it won't be so easy to tear yourself away as you are<br/>boasting now."<br/><br/>Remembering that night long afterwards, Ivan recalled with<br/>peculiar repulsion how he had suddenly got up from the sofa and had<br/>stealthily, as though he were afraid of being watched, opened the<br/>door, gone out on the staircase and listened to Fyodor Pavlovitch<br/>stirring down below, had listened a long while- some five minutes-<br/>with a sort of strange curiosity, holding his breath while his<br/>heart throbbed. And why he had done all this, why he was listening,<br/>he could not have said. That "action" all his life afterwards he<br/>called "infamous," and at the bottom of his heart, he thought of it<br/>as the basest action of his life. For Fyodor Pavlovitch himself he<br/>felt no hatred at that moment, but was simply intensely curious to<br/>know how he was walking down there below and what he must be doing<br/>now. He wondered and imagined how he must be peeping out of the<br/>dark windows and stopping in the middle of the room, listening,<br/>listening- for someone to knock. Ivan went out on the stairs twice<br/>to listen like this.<br/>
