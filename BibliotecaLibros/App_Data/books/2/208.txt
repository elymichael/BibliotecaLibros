"If he had been afraid of being shot, he would have shot his own
pistol first before asking forgiveness, while he flung it loaded
into the forest. No, there's something else in this, something
original."

I enjoyed listening and looking at them. "My dear friends and
comrades," said I, "don't worry about my resigning my commission,
for I have done so already. I have sent in my papers this morning
and as soon as I get my discharge I shall go into a monastery- it's
with that object I am leaving the regiment."

When I had said this every one of them burst out laughing.

"You should have told us of that first, that explains
everything, we can't judge a monk."

They laughed and could not stop themselves, and not scornfully,
but kindly and merrily. They all felt friendly to me at once, even
those who had been sternest in their censure, and all the following
month, before my discharge came, they could not make enough of me.
"Ah, you monk," they would say. And everyone said something kind to
me, they began trying to dissuade me, even to pity me: "What are
you doing to yourself?"

"No," they would say, "he is a brave fellow, he faced fire and
could have fired his own pistol too, but he had a dream the night
before that he should become a monk, that's why he did it."

It was the same thing with the society of the town. Till then I
had been kindly received, but had not been the object of special
attention, and now all came to know me at once and invited me; they
laughed at me, but they loved me. I may mention that although
everybody talked openly of our duel, the authorities took no notice
of it, because my antagonist was a near relation of our general,
and as there had been no bloodshed and no serious consequences, and
as I resigned my commission, they took it as a joke. And I began
then to speak aloud and fearlessly, regardless of their laughter,
for it was always kindly and not spiteful laughter. These
conversations mostly took place in the evenings, in the company of
ladies; women particularly liked listening to me then and they made
the men listen.

"But how can I possibly be responsible for all?" everyone would
laugh in my face. "Can I, for instance, be responsible for
you?"

"You may well not know it," I would answer, "since the whole
world has long been going on a different line, since we consider
the veriest lies as truth and demand the same lies from others.
Here I have for once in my life acted sincerely and, well, you all
look upon me as a madman. Though you are friendly to me, yet, you
see, you all laugh at me."

"But how can we help being friendly to you?" said my hostess,
laughing. The room was full of people. All of a sudden the young
lady rose, on whose account the duel had been fought and whom only
lately I had intended to be my future wife. I had not noticed her
coming into the room. She got up, came to me and held out her
hand.
