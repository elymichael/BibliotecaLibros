"Good-bye! Forgive me, all of you" he said, bowing on all sides
to his guests.

Dmitri stood for a few moments in amazement. Bowing down to him-
what did it mean? Suddenly he cried aloud, "Oh God!" hid his face
in his hands, and rushed out of the room. All the guests flocked
out after him, in their confusion not saying good-bye, or bowing to
their host. Only the monks went up to him again for a blessing.

"What did it mean, falling at his feet like that? Was it
symbolic or what?" said Fyodor Pavlovitch, suddenly quieted and
trying to reopen conversation without venturing to address anybody
in particular. They were all passing out of the precincts of the
hermitage at the moment.

"I can't answer for a madhouse and for madmen," Miusov answered
at once ill-humouredly, "but I will spare myself your company,
Fyodor Pavlovitch, and, trust me, for ever. Where's that monk?"

"That monk," that is, the monk who had invited them to dine with
the Superior, did not keep them waiting. He met them as soon as
they came down the steps from the elder's cell, as though he had
been waiting for them all the time.

"Reverend Father, kindly do me a favour. Convey my deepest
respect to the Father Superior, apologise for me, personally,
Miusov, to his reverence, telling him that I deeply regret that
owing to unforeseen circumstances I am unable to have the honour of
being present at his table, greatly I should desire to do so,"
Miusov said irritably to the monk.

"And that unforeseen circumstance, of course, is myself," Fyodor
Pavlovitch cut in immediately. "Do you hear, Father; this gentleman
doesn't want to remain in my company or else he'd come at once. And
you shall go, Pyotr Alexandrovitch, pray go to the Father Superior
and good appetite to you. I will decline, and not you. Home, home,
I'll eat at home, I don't feel equal to it here, Pyotr
Alexandrovitch, my amiable relative."

"I am not your relative and never have been, you contemptible
man!"

"I said it on purpose to madden you, because you always disclaim
the relationship, though you really are a relation in spite of your
shuffling. I'll prove it by the church calendar. As for you, Ivan,
stay if you like. I'll send the horses for you later. Propriety
requires you to go to the Father Superior, Pyotr Alexandrovitch, to
apologise for the disturbance we've been makingâ€¦ ."

"Is it true that you are going home? Aren't you lying?"
