Nastya inquired.<br/><br/>"Yes."<br/><br/>"Show us the powder, too," she drawled with a smile of<br/>entreaty.<br/><br/>Krassotkin dived again into his satchel and pulled out a small<br/>flask containing a little real gunpowder. He had some shot, too, in<br/>a screw of paper. He even uncorked the flask and shook a little<br/>powder into the palm of his hand.<br/><br/>"One has to be careful there's no fire about, or it would blow<br/>up and kill us all," Krassotkin warned them sensationally.<br/><br/>The children gazed at the powder with an awe-stricken alarm that<br/>only intensified their enjoyment. But Kostya liked the shot<br/>better.<br/><br/>"And does the shot burn?" he inquired.<br/><br/>"No, it doesn't."<br/><br/>"Give me a little shot," he asked in an imploring voice.<br/><br/>"I'll give you a little shot; here, take it, but don't show it<br/>to your mother till I come back, or she'll be sure to think it's<br/>gunpowder, and will die of fright and give you a thrashing."<br/><br/>
