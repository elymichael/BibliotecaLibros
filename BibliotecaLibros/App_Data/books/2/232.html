<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>2<br/>A<br/>Critical Moment<br/><br/><br/>FATHER PAISSY, of course, was not wrong when he decided that his<br/>"dear boy" would come back again. Perhaps indeed, to some extent,<br/>he penetrated with insight into the true meaning of Alyosha's<br/>spiritual condition. Yet I must frankly own that it would be very<br/>difficult for me to give a clear account of that strange, vague<br/>moment in the life of the young hero I love so much. To Father<br/>Paissy's sorrowful question, "Are you too with those of little<br/>faith?" I could, of course, confidently answer for Alyosha, "No, he<br/>is not with those of little faith. Quite the contrary." Indeed, all<br/>his trouble came from the fact that he was of great faith. But<br/>still the trouble was there and was so agonising that even long<br/>afterwards Alyosha thought of that sorrowful day as one of the<br/>bitterest and most fatal days of his life. If the question is<br/>asked: "Could all his grief and disturbance have been only due to<br/>the fact that his elder's body had shown signs of premature<br/>decomposition instead of at once performing miracles?" I must<br/>answer without beating about the bush, "Yes, it certainly was." I<br/>would only beg the reader not to be in too great a hurry to laugh<br/>at my young hero's pure heart. I am far from intending to apologise<br/>for him or to justify his innocent faith on the ground of his<br/>youth, or the little progress he had made in his studies, or any<br/>such reason. I must declare, on the contrary, that I have genuine<br/>respect for the qualities of his heart. No doubt a youth who<br/>received impressions cautiously, whose love was lukewarm, and whose<br/>mind was too prudent for his age and so of little value, such a<br/>young man might, I admit, have avoided what happened to my hero.<br/>But in some cases it is really more creditable to be carried away<br/>by an emotion, however unreasonable, which springs from a great<br/>love, than to be unmoved. And this is even truer in youth, for a<br/>young man who is always sensible is to be suspected and is of<br/>little worth- that's my opinion!<br/><br/>"But," reasonable people will exclaim perhaps, "every young man<br/>cannot believe in such a superstition and your hero is no model for<br/>others."<br/><br/>To this I reply again, "Yes! my hero had faith, a faith holy and<br/>steadfast, but still I am not going to apologise for him."<br/><br/>Though I declared above, and perhaps too hastily, that I should<br/>not explain or justify my hero, I see that some explanation is<br/>necessary for the understanding of the rest of my story. Let me say<br/>then, it was not a question of miracles. There was no frivolous and<br/>impatient expectation of miracles in his mind. And Alyosha needed<br/>no miracles at the time, for the triumph of some preconceived idea-<br/>oh no, not at all- what he saw before all was one figure- the<br/>figure of his beloved elder, the figure of that holy man whom he<br/>revered with such adoration. The fact is that all the love that lay<br/>concealed in his pure young heart for everyone and everything had,<br/>for the past year, been concentrated- and perhaps wrongly so- on<br/>one being, his beloved elder. It is true that being had for so long<br/>been accepted by him as his ideal, that all his young strength and<br/>energy could not but turn towards that ideal, even to the<br/>forgetting at the moment "of everyone and everything." He<br/>remembered afterwards how, on that terrible day, he had entirely<br/>forgotten his brother Dmitri, about whom he had been so anxious and<br/>troubled the day before; he had forgotten, too, to take the two<br/>hundred roubles to Ilusha's father, though he had so warmly<br/>intended to do so the preceding evening. But again it was not<br/>miracles he needed but only "the higher justice" which had been in<br/>his belief outraged by the blow that had so suddenly and cruelly<br/>wounded his heart. And what does it signify that this "justice"<br/>looked for by Alyosha inevitably took the shape of miracles to be<br/>wrought immediately by the ashes of his adored teacher? Why,<br/>everyone in the monastery cherished the same thought and the same<br/>hope, even those whose intellects Alyosha revered, Father Paissy<br/>himself, for instance. And so Alyosha, untroubled by doubts,<br/>clothed his dreams too in the same form as all the rest. And a<br/>whole year of life in the monastery had formed the habit of this<br/>expectation in his heart. But it was justice, justice, he thirsted<br/>for, not simply miracles.<br/><br/>And now the man who should, he believed, have been exalted above<br/>everyone in the whole world, that man, instead of receiving the<br/>glory that was his due, was suddenly degraded and dishonoured! What<br/>for? Who had judged him? Who could have decreed this? Those were<br/>the questions that wrung his inexperienced and virginal heart. He<br/>could not endure without mortification, without resentment even,<br/>that the holiest of holy men should have been exposed to the<br/>jeering and spiteful mockery of the frivolous crowd so inferior to<br/>him. Even had there been no miracles, had there been nothing<br/>marvellous to justify his hopes, why this indignity, why this<br/>humiliation, why this premature decay, "in excess of nature," as<br/>the spiteful monks said? Why this "sign from heaven," which they so<br/>triumphantly acclaimed in company with Father Ferapont, and why did<br/>they believe they had gained the right to acclaim it? Where is the<br/>finger of Providence? Why did Providence hide its face "at the most<br/>critical moment" (so Alyosha thought it), as though voluntarily<br/>submitting to the blind, dumb, pitiless laws of nature?<br/><br/>That was why Alyosha's heart was bleeding, and, of course, as I<br/>have said already, the sting of it all was that the man he loved<br/>above everything on earth should be put to shame and humiliated!<br/>This murmuring may have been shallow and unreasonable in my hero,<br/>but I repeat again for the third time- and am prepared to admit<br/>that it might be difficult to defend my feeling- I am glad that my<br/>hero showed himself not too reasonable at that moment, for any man<br/>of sense will always come back to reason in time, but, if love does<br/>not gain the upper hand in a boy's heart at such an exceptional<br/>moment, when will it? I will not, however, omit to mention<br/>something strange, which came for a time to the surface of<br/>Alyosha's mind at this fatal and obscure moment. This new something<br/>was the harassing impression left by the conversation with Ivan,<br/>which now persistently haunted Alyosha's mind. At this moment it<br/>haunted him. Oh, it was not that something of the fundamental,<br/>elemental, so to speak, faith of his soul had been shaken. He loved<br/>his God and believed in Him steadfastly, though he was suddenly<br/>murmuring against Him. Yet a vague but tormenting and evil<br/>impression left by his conversation with Ivan the day before,<br/>suddenly revived again now in his soul and seemed forcing its way<br/>to the surface of his consciousness.<br/><br/>It had begun to get dusk when Rakitin, crossing the pine copse<br/>from the hermitage to the monastery, suddenly noticed Alyosha,<br/>lying face downwards on the ground under a tree, not moving and<br/>apparently asleep. He went up and called him by his name.<br/>
