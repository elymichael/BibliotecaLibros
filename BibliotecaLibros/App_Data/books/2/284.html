Seeing him with his face all smeared with blood, the young man<br/>uttered a cry of surprise.<br/><br/>"Good heavens! What is the matter?"<br/><br/>"I've come for my pistols," said Mitya, "and brought you the<br/>money. And thanks very much. I'm in a hurry, Pyotr Ilyitch, please<br/>make haste."<br/><br/>Pyotr Ilyitch grew more and more surprised; he suddenly caught<br/>sight of a bundle of banknotes in Mitya's hand, and what was more,<br/>he had walked in holding the notes as no one walks in and no one<br/>carries money: he had them in his right hand, and held them<br/>outstretched as if to show them. Perhotin's servant-boy, who met<br/>Mitya in the passage, said afterwards that he walked into the<br/>passage in the same way, with the money outstretched in his hand,<br/>so he must have been carrying them like that even in the streets.<br/>They were all rainbow-coloured hundred-rouble notes, and the<br/>fingers holding them were covered with blood.<br/><br/>When Pyotr Ilyitch was questioned later on as to the sum of<br/>money, he said that it was difficult to judge at a glance, but that<br/>it might have been two thousand, or perhaps three, but it was a<br/>big, "fat" bundle. "Dmitri Fyodorovitch," so he testified<br/>afterwards, "seemed unlike himself, too; not drunk, but, as it<br/>were, exalted, lost to everything, but at the same time, as it<br/>were, absorbed, as though pondering and searching for something and<br/>unable to come to a decision. He was in great haste, answered<br/>abruptly and very strangely, and at moments seemed not at all<br/>dejected but quite cheerful."<br/><br/>"But what is the matter with you? What's wrong?" cried Pyotr<br/>Ilyitch, looking wildly at his guest. "How is it that you're all<br/>covered with blood? Have you had a fall? Look at yourself!"<br/><br/>He took him by the elbow and led him to the glass.<br/><br/>Seeing his blood-stained face, Mitya started and scowled<br/>wrathfully.<br/><br/>"Damnation! That's the last straw," he muttered angrily,<br/>hurriedly changing the notes from his right hand to the left, and<br/>impulsively jerked the handkerchief out of his pocket. But the<br/>handkerchief turned out to be soaked with blood, too (it was the<br/>handkerchief he had used to wipe Grigory's face). There was<br/>scarcely a white spot on it, and it had not merely begun to dry,<br/>but had stiffened into a crumpled ball and could not be pulled<br/>apart. Mitya threw it angrily on the floor.<br/><br/>"Oh, damn it!" he said. "Haven't you a rag of some sortâ€¦ to wipe<br/>my face?"<br/><br/>"So you're only stained, not wounded? You'd better wash," said<br/>Pyotr Ilyitch. "Here's a wash-stand. I'll pour you out some<br/>water."<br/>
