The President again and again warned Mitya impressively and very
sternly to be more careful in his language.

"You are injuring yourself in the opinion of your judges."

The counsel for the defence was equally clever in dealing with
the evidence of Rakitin. I may remark that Rakitin was one of the
leading witnesses and one to whom the prosecutor attached great
significance. It appeared that he knew everything; his knowledge
was amazing, he had been everywhere, seen everything, talked to
everybody, knew every detail of the biography of Fyodor Pavlovitch
and all the Karamazovs. Of the envelope, it is true, he had only
heard from Mitya himself. But he described minutely Mitya's
exploits in the Metropolis, all his compromising doings and
sayings, and told the story of Captain Snegiryov's "wisp of tow."
But even Rakitin could say nothing positive about Mitya's
inheritance, and confined himself to contemptuous generalities.

"Who could tell which of them was to blame, and which was in
debt to the other, with their crazy Karamazov way of muddling
things so that no one could make head or tail of it?" He attributed
the tragic crime to the habits that had become ingrained by ages of
serfdom and the distressed condition of Russia, due to the lack of
appropriate institutions. He was, in fact, allowed some latitude of
speech. This was the first occasion on which Rakitin showed what he
could do, and attracted notice. The prosecutor knew that the
witness was preparing a magazine article on the case, and
afterwards in his speech, as we shall see later, quoted some ideas
from the article, showing that he had seen it already. The picture
drawn by the witness was a gloomy and sinister one, and greatly
strengthened the case for the prosecution. Altogether, Rakatin's
discourse fascinated the public by its independence and the
extraordinary nobility of its ideas. There were even two or three
outbreaks of applause when he spoke of serfdom and the distressed
condition of Russia.

But Rakitin, in his youthful ardour, made a slight blunder, of
which the counsel for the defence at once adroitly took advantage.
Answering certain questions about Grushenka and carried away by the
loftiness of his own sentiments and his success, of which he was,
of course, conscious, he went so far as to speak somewhat
contemptuously of Agrafena Alexandrovna as "the kept mistress of
Samsonov." He would have given a good deal to take back his words
afterwards, for Fetyukovitch caught him out over it at once. And it
was all because Rakitin had not reckoned on the lawyer having been
able to become so intimately acquainted with every detail in so
short a time.

"Allow me to ask," began the counsel for the defence, with the
most affable and even respectful smile, "you are, of course, the
same Mr. Rakitin whose pamphlet, The Life of the Deceased Elder,
Father Zossima, published by the diocesan authorities, full of
profound and religious reflections and preceded by an excellent and
devout dedication to the bishop, I have just read with such
pleasure?"

"I did not write it for publication… it was published
afterwards," muttered Rakitin, for some reason fearfully
disconcerted and almost ashamed.

"Oh, that's excellent! A thinker like you can, and indeed ought
to, take the widest view of every social question. Your most
instructive pamphlet has been widely circulated through the
patronage of the bishop, and has been of appreciable service… . But
this is the chief thing I should like to learn from you. You stated
just now that you were very intimately acquainted with Madame
Svyetlov." (It must be noted that Grushenka's surname was Svyetlov.
I heard it for the first time that day, during the case.)

"I cannot answer for all my acquaintances… . I am a young man…
and who can be responsible for everyone he meets?" cried Rakitin,
flushing all over.

"I understand, I quite understand," cried Fetyukovitch; as
though he, too, were embarrassed and in haste to excuse himself.
"You, like any other, might well be interested in an acquaintance
with a young and beautiful woman who would readily entertain the
elite of the youth of the neighbourhood, but… I only wanted to
know… It has come to my knowledge, that Madame Svyetlov was
particularly anxious a couple of months ago to make the
acquaintance of the younger Karamazov, Alexey Fyodorovitch, and
promised you twenty-five roubles, if you would bring him to her in
his monastic dress. And that actually took place on the evening of
the day on which the terrible crime, which is the subject of the
present investigation, was committed. You brought Alexey Karamazov
to Madame Svyetlov, and did you receive the twenty-five roubles
from Madame Svyetlov as a reward, that's what I wanted to hear from
you?"

"It was a joke… . I don't, see of what interest that can be to
you… . I took it for a joke… meaning to give it back later… "
