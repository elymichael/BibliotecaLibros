"As God's above, it's involuntary, and I usen't to use it! I<br/>didn't use the word 'sir' all my life, but as soon as I sank into<br/>low water I began to say 'sir.' It's the work of a higher power. I<br/>see you are interested in contemporary questions, but how can I<br/>have excited your curiosity, living as I do in surroundings<br/>impossible for the exercise of hospitality?"<br/><br/>"I've come- about that business."<br/><br/>"About what business?" the captain interrupted impatiently.<br/><br/>"About your meeting with my brother Dmitri Fyodorovitch,"<br/>Alyosha blurted out awkwardly.<br/><br/>"What meeting, sir? You don't mean that meeting? About my 'wisp<br/>of tow,' then?" He moved closer so that his knees positively<br/>knocked against Alyosha. His lips were strangely compressed like a<br/>thread.<br/><br/>"What wisp of tow?" muttered Alyosha.<br/><br/>"He is come to complain of me, father!" cried a voice familiar<br/>to Alyosha- the voice of the schoolboy- from behind the curtain. "I<br/>bit his finger just now." The curtain was pulled, and Alyosha saw<br/>his assailant lying on a little bed made up on the bench and the<br/>chair in the corner under the ikons. The boy lay covered by his<br/>coat and an old wadded quilt. He was evidently unwell, and, judging<br/>by his glittering eyes, he was in a fever. He looked at Alyosha<br/>without fear, as though he felt he was at home and could not be<br/>touched.<br/><br/>"What! Did he bite your finger?" The captain jumped up from his<br/>chair. "Was it your finger he bit?"<br/><br/>"Yes. He was throwing stones with other schoolboys. There were<br/>six of them against him alone. I went up to him, and he threw a<br/>stone at me and then another at my head. I asked him what I had<br/>done to him. And then he rushed at me and bit my finger badly, I<br/>don't know why."<br/><br/>"I'll thrash him, sir, at once- this minute!" The captain jumped<br/>up from his seat.<br/><br/>"But I am not complaining at all, I am simply telling youâ€¦ . I<br/>don't want him to be thrashed. Besides, he seems to be ill."<br/>
