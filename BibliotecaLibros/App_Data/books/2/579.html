<br/>"I asked just now what does 'father' mean, and exclaimed that it<br/>was a great word, a precious name. But one must use words honestly,<br/>gentlemen, and I venture to call things by their right names: such<br/>a father as old Karamazov cannot be called a father and does not<br/>deserve to be. Filial love for an unworthy father is an absurdity,<br/>an impossibility. Love cannot be created from nothing: only God can<br/>create something from nothing.<br/><br/>"'Fathers, provoke not your children to wrath,' the apostle<br/>writes, from a heart glowing with love. It's not for the sake of my<br/>client that I quote these sacred words, I mention them for all<br/>fathers. Who has authorised me to preach to fathers? No one. But as<br/>a man and a citizen I make my appeal- vivos voco! We are not long<br/>on earth, we do many evil deeds and say many evil words. So let us<br/>all catch a favourable moment when we are all together to say a<br/>good word to each other. That's what I am doing: while I am in this<br/>place I take advantage of my opportunity. Not for nothing is this<br/>tribune given us by the highest authority- all Russia hears us! I<br/>am not speaking only for the fathers here present, I cry aloud to<br/>all fathers: 'Fathers, provoke not your children to wrath.' Yes,<br/>let us first fulfil Christ's injunction ourselves and only then<br/>venture to expect it of our children. Otherwise we are not fathers,<br/>but enemies of our children, and they are not our children, but our<br/>enemies, and we have made them our enemies ourselves. 'What measure<br/>ye mete it shall be measured unto you again'- it's not I who say<br/>that, it's the Gospel precept, measure to others according as they<br/>measure to you. How can we blame children if they measure us<br/>according to our measure?<br/><br/>"Not long ago a servant girl in Finland was suspected of having<br/>secretly given birth to a child. She was watched, and a box of<br/>which no one knew anything was found in the corner of the loft,<br/>behind some bricks. It was opened and inside was found the body of<br/>a new-born child which she had killed. In the same box were found<br/>the skeletons of two other babies which, according to her own<br/>confession, she had killed at the moment of their birth.<br/><br/>"Gentlemen of the jury, was she a mother to her children? She<br/>gave birth to them, indeed; but was she a mother to them? Would<br/>anyone venture to give her the sacred name of mother? Let us be<br/>bold, gentlemen, let us be audacious even: it's our duty to be so<br/>at this moment and not to be afraid of certain words and ideas like<br/>the Moscow women in Ostrovsky's play, who are scared at the sound<br/>of certain words. No, let us prove that the progress of the last<br/>few years has touched even us, and let us say plainly, the father<br/>is not merely he who begets the child, but he who begets it and<br/>does his duty by it.<br/><br/>"Oh, of course, there is the other meaning, there is the other<br/>interpretation of the word 'father,' which insists that any father,<br/>even though he be a monster, even though he be the enemy of his<br/>children, still remains my father simply because he begot me. But<br/>this is, so to say, the mystical meaning which I cannot comprehend<br/>with my intellect, but can only accept by faith, or, better to say,<br/>on faith, like many other things which I do not understand, but<br/>which religion bids me believe. But in that case let it be kept<br/>outside the sphere of actual life. In the sphere of actual life,<br/>which has, indeed, its own rights, but also lays upon us great<br/>duties and obligations, in that sphere, if we want to be humane-<br/>Christian, in fact- we must, or ought to, act only upon convictions<br/>justified by reason and experience, which have been passed through<br/>the crucible of analysis; in a word, we must act rationally, and<br/>not as though in dream and delirium, that we may not do harm, that<br/>we may not ill-treat and ruin a man. Then it will be real Christian<br/>work, not only mystic, but rational and philanthropic… ."<br/><br/>There was violent applause at this passage from many parts of<br/>the court, but Fetyukovitch waved his hands as though imploring<br/>them to let him finish without interruption. The court relapsed<br/>into silence at once. The orator went on.<br/><br/>"Do you suppose, gentlemen, that our children as they grow up<br/>and begin to reason can avoid such questions? No, they cannot, and<br/>we will not impose on them an impossible restriction. The sight of<br/>an unworthy father involuntarily suggests tormenting questions to a<br/>young creature, especially when he compares him with the excellent<br/>fathers of his companions. The conventional answer to this question<br/>is: 'He begot you, and you are his flesh and blood, and therefore<br/>you are bound to love him.' The youth involuntarily reflects: 'But<br/>did he love me when he begot me?' he asks, wondering more and more.<br/>'Was it for my sake he begot me? He did not know me, not even my<br/>sex, at that moment, at the moment of passion, perhaps, inflamed by<br/>wine, and he has only transmitted to me a propensity to<br/>drunkenness- that's all he's done for me… . Why am I bound to love<br/>him simply for begetting me when he has cared nothing for me all my<br/>life after?'<br/><br/>"Oh, perhaps those questions strike you as coarse and cruel, but<br/>do not expect an impossible restraint from a young mind. 'Drive<br/>nature out of the door and it will fly in at the window,' and,<br/>above all, let us not be afraid of words, but decide the question<br/>according to the dictates of reason and humanity and not of mystic<br/>ideas. How shall it be decided? Why, like this. Let the son stand<br/>before his father and ask him, 'Father, tell me, why must I love<br/>you? Father, show me that I must love you,' and if that father is<br/>able to answer him and show him good reason, we have a real,<br/>normal, parental relation, not resting on mystical prejudice, but<br/>on a rational, responsible and strictly humanitarian basis. But if<br/>he does not, there's an end to the family tie. He is not a father<br/>to him, and the son has a right to look upon him as a stranger, and<br/>even an enemy. Our tribune, gentlemen of the jury, ought to be a<br/>school of true and sound ideas."<br/><br/>(Here the orator was interrupted by irrepressible and almost<br/>frantic applause. Of course, it was not the whole audience, but a<br/>good half of it applauded. The fathers and mothers present<br/>applauded. Shrieks and exclamations were heard from the gallery,<br/>where the ladies were sitting. Handkerchiefs were waved. The<br/>President began ringing his bell with all his might. He was<br/>obviously irritated by the behaviour of the audience, but did not<br/>venture to clear the court as he had threatened. Even persons of<br/>high position, old men with stars on their breasts, sitting on<br/>specially reserved seats behind the judges, applauded the orator<br/>and waved their handkerchiefs. So that when the noise died down,<br/>the President confined himself to repeating his stern threat to<br/>clear the court, and Fetyukovitch, excited and triumphant,<br/>continued his speech.)<br/><br/>"Gentlemen of the jury, you remember that awful night of which<br/>so much has been said to-day, when the son got over the fence and<br/>stood face to face with the enemy and persecutor who had begotten<br/>him. I insist most emphatically it was not for money he ran to his<br/>father's house: the charge of robbery is an absurdity, as I proved<br/>before. And it was not to murder him he broke into the house, oh,<br/>no! If he had had that design he would, at least, have taken the<br/>precaution of arming himself beforehand. The brass pestle he caught<br/>up instinctively without knowing why he did it. Granted that he<br/>deceived his father by tapping at the window, granted that he made<br/>his way in- I've said already that I do not for a moment believe<br/>that legend, but let it be so, let us suppose it for a moment.<br/>Gentlemen, I swear to you by all that's holy, if it had not been<br/>his father, but an ordinary enemy, he would, after running through<br/>the rooms and satisfying himself that the woman was not there, have<br/>made off, post-haste, without doing any harm to his rival. He would<br/>have struck him, pushed him away perhaps, nothing more, for he had<br/>no thought and no time to spare for that. What he wanted to know<br/>was where she was. But his father, his father! The mere sight of<br/>the father who had hated him from his childhood, had been his<br/>enemy, his persecutor, and now his unnatural rival, was enough! A<br/>feeling of hatred came over him involuntarily, irresistibly,<br/>clouding his reason. It all surged up in one moment! It was an<br/>impulse of madness and insanity, but also an impulse of nature,<br/>irresistibly and unconsciously (like everything in nature) avenging<br/>the violation of its eternal laws.<br/><br/>
