"Forgive me," I said.

Then he was completely aghast.

"Your honourâ€¦ sir, what are you doing? Am I worth it?"

And he burst out crying as I had done before, hid his face in
his hands, turned to the window and shook all over with his sobs. I
flew out to my comrade and jumped into the carriage.

"Ready," I cried. "Have you ever seen a conqueror?" I asked him.
"Here is one before you."

I was in ecstasy, laughing and talking all the way, I don't
remember what about.

He looked at me. "Well, brother, you are a plucky fellow, you'll
keep up the honour of the uniform, I can see."

So we reached the place and found them there, waiting us. We
were placed twelve paces apart; he had the first shot. I stood
gaily, looking him full in the face; I did not twitch an eyelash, I
looked lovingly at him, for I knew what I would do. His shot just
grazed my cheek and ear.

"Thank God," I cried, "no man has been killed," and I seized my
pistol, turned back and flung it far away into the wood. "That's
the place for you," I cried.

I turned to my adversary.

"Forgive me, young fool that I am, sir," I said, "for my
unprovoked insult to you and for forcing you to fire at me. I am
ten times worse than you and more, maybe. Tell that to the person
whom you hold dearest in the world."
