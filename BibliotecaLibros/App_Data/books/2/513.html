Ivan sank back on his chair, as though pondering something. He<br/>laughed malignantly.<br/><br/>"You mean my going away. What you talked about last time?"<br/><br/>"You stood before me last time and understood it all, and you<br/>understand it now."<br/><br/>"All I understand is that you are mad."<br/><br/>"Aren't you tired of it? Here we are face to face; what's the<br/>use of going on keeping up a farce to each other? Are you still<br/>trying to throw it all on me, to my face? You murdered him; you are<br/>the real murderer, I was only your instrument, your faithful<br/>servant, and it was following your words I did it."<br/><br/>"Did it? Why, did you murder him?" Ivan turned cold.<br/><br/>Something seemed to give way in his brain, and he shuddered all<br/>over with a cold shiver. Then Smerdyakov himself looked at him<br/>wonderingly; probably the genuineness of Ivan's horror struck<br/>him.<br/><br/>"You don't mean to say you really did not know?" he faltered<br/>mistrustfully, looking with a forced smile into his eyes. Ivan<br/>still gazed at him, and seemed unable to speak.<br/><br/>Ach, Vanka's gone to Petersburg;<br/><br/>I won't wait till he comes back, suddenly echoed in his<br/>head.<br/><br/>"Do you know, I am afraid that you are a dream, a phantom<br/>sitting before me," he muttered.<br/>
