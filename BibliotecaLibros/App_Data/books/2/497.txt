"Forgive me, I thought you were like me."

"Of course, I ought to have guessed," Ivan said in agitation;
"and I did guess there was some mischief brewing on your partâ€¦ only
you are lying, you are lying again," he cried, suddenly
recollecting. "Do you remember how you went up to the carriage and
said to me, 'It's always worth while speaking to a clever man'? So
you were glad I went away, since you praised me?"

Smerdyakov sighed again and again. A trace of colour came into
his face.

"If I was pleased," he articulated rather breathlessly, "it was
simply because you agreed not to go to Moscow, but to Tchermashnya.
For it was nearer, anyway. Only when I said these words to you, it
was not by way of praise, but of reproach. You didn't understand
it."

"What reproach?"

"Why, that foreseeing such a calamity you deserted your own
father, and would not protect us, for I might have been taken up
any time for stealing that three thousand."

"Damn you!" Ivan swore again. "Stay, did you tell the prosecutor
and the investigating lawyer about those knocks?"

"I told them everything just as it was."

Ivan wondered inwardly again.
