<br/>"As for mutton, that's not so, and there'll be nothing there for<br/>this, and there shouldn't be either, if it's according to justice,"<br/>Smerdyakov maintained stoutly.<br/><br/>"How do you mean 'according to justice'?" Fyodor Pavlovitch<br/>cried still more gaily, nudging Alyosha with his knee.<br/><br/>"He's a rascal, that's what he is!" burst from Grigory. He<br/>looked Smerdyakov wrathfully in the face.<br/><br/>"As for being a rascal, wait a little, Grigory Vassilyevitch,"<br/>answered Smerdyakov with perfect composure. "You'd better consider<br/>yourself that, once I am taken prisoner by the enemies of the<br/>Christian race, and they demand from me to curse the name of God<br/>and to renounce my holy christening, I am fully entitled to act by<br/>my own reason, since there would be no sin in it."<br/><br/>"But you've said that before. Don't waste words. Prove it,"<br/>cried Fyodor Pavlovitch.<br/><br/>"Soup-maker!" muttered Grigory contemptuously.<br/><br/>"As for being a soup-maker, wait a bit, too, and consider for<br/>yourself, Grigory Vassilyevitch, without abusing me. For as soon as<br/>I say to those enemies, 'No, I'm not a Christian, and I curse my<br/>true God,' then at once, by God's high judgment, I become<br/>immediately and specially anathema accursed, and am cut off from<br/>the Holy Church, exactly as though I were a heathen, so that at<br/>that very instant, not only when I say it aloud, but when I think<br/>of saying it, before a quarter of a second has passed, I am cut<br/>off. Is that so or not, Grigory Vassilyevitch?"<br/><br/>He addressed Grigory with obvious satisfaction, though he was<br/>really answering Fyodor Pavlovitch's questions, and was well aware<br/>of it, and intentionally pretending that Grigory had asked the<br/>questions.<br/><br/>"Ivan," cried Fyodor Pavlovitch suddenly, "stoop down for me to<br/>whisper. He's got this all up for your benefit. He wants you to<br/>praise him. Praise him."<br/><br/>Ivan listened with perfect seriousness to his father's excited<br/>whisper.<br/><br/>
