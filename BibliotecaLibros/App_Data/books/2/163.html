Can you tell me?" asked Lise with timid<br/>entreaty.<br/><br/>"I'll tell you later, Lise- afterwards," said Alyosha, confused.<br/>"Now you wouldn't understand it perhaps- and perhaps I couldn't<br/>explain it."<br/><br/>"I know your brothers and your father are worrying you,<br/>too."<br/><br/>"Yes, my brothers too," murmured Alyosha, pondering.<br/><br/>"I don't like your brother Ivan, Alyosha," said Lise<br/>suddenly.<br/><br/>He noticed this remark with some surprise, but did not answer<br/>it.<br/><br/>"My brothers are destroying themselves," he went on, "my father,<br/>too. And they are destroying others with them. It's 'the primitive<br/>force of the Karamazovs,' as father Paissy said the other day, a<br/>crude, unbridled, earthly force. Does the spirit of God move above<br/>that force? Even that I don't know. I only know that I, too, am a<br/>Karamazovâ€¦ . Me a monk, a monk! Am I a monk, Lise? You said just<br/>now that I was."<br/><br/>"Yes, I did."<br/><br/>"And perhaps I don't even believe in God."<br/><br/>"You don't believe? What is the matter?" said Lise quietly and<br/>gently. But Alyosha did not answer. There was something too<br/>mysterious, too subjective in these last words of his, perhaps<br/>obscure to himself, but yet torturing him.<br/><br/>
