<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>5<br/>So<br/>Be It! So Be It!<br/><br/><br/>THE elder's absence from his cell had lasted for about<br/>twenty-five minutes. It was more than half-past twelve, but Dmitri,<br/>on whose account they had all met there, had still not appeared.<br/>But he seemed almost to be forgotten, and when the elder entered<br/>the cell again, he found his guests engaged in eager conversation.<br/>Ivan and the two monks took the leading share in it. Miusov, too,<br/>was trying to take a part, and apparently very eagerly, in the<br/>conversation. But he was unsuccessful in this also. He was<br/>evidently in the background, and his remarks were treated with<br/>neglect, which increased his irritability. He had had intellectual<br/>encounters with Ivan before and he could not endure a certain<br/>carelessness Ivan showed him.<br/><br/>"Hitherto at least I have stood in the front ranks of all that<br/>is progressive in Europe, and here the new generation positively<br/>ignores us," he thought.<br/><br/>Fyodor Pavlovitch, who had given his word to sit still and be<br/>quiet, had actually been quiet for some time, but he watched his<br/>neighbour Miusov with an ironical little smile, obviously enjoying<br/>his discomfiture. He had been waiting for some time to pay off old<br/>scores, and now he could not let the opportunity slip. Bending over<br/>his shoulder he began teasing him again in a whisper.<br/><br/>"Why didn't you go away just now, after the 'courteously<br/>kissing'? Why did you consent to remain in such unseemly company?<br/>It was because you felt insulted and aggrieved, and you remained to<br/>vindicate yourself by showing off your intelligence. Now you won't<br/>go till you've displayed your intellect to them."<br/><br/>"You again?â€¦ On the contrary, I'm just going."<br/><br/>"You'll be the last, the last of all to go!" Fyodor Pavlovitch<br/>delivered him another thrust, almost at the moment of Father<br/>Zossima's return.<br/><br/>The discussion died down for a moment, but the elder, seating<br/>himself in his former place, looked at them all as though cordially<br/>inviting them to go on. Alyosha, who knew every expression of his<br/>face, saw that he was fearfully exhausted and making a great<br/>effort. Of late he had been liable to fainting fits from<br/>exhaustion. His face had the pallor that was common before such<br/>attacks, and his lips were white. But he evidently did not want to<br/>break up the party. He seemed to have some special object of his<br/>own in keeping them. What object? Alyosha watched him intently.<br/>
