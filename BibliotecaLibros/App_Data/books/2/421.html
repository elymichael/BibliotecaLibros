"Not the whole class: it's only ten of our fellows who go to see<br/>him every day. There's nothing in that."<br/><br/>"What I don't understand in all this is the part that Alexey<br/>Karamazov is taking in it. His brother's going to be tried<br/>to-morrow or next day for such a crime, and yet he has so much time<br/>to spend on sentimentality with boys."<br/><br/>"There's no sentimentality about it. You are going yourself now<br/>to make it up with Ilusha."<br/><br/>"Make it up with him? What an absurd expression! But I allow no<br/>one to analyse my actions."<br/><br/>"And how pleased Ilusha will be to see you! He has no idea that<br/>you are coming. Why was it, why was it you wouldn't come all this<br/>time?" Smurov cried with sudden warmth.<br/><br/>"My dear boy, that's my business, not yours.<br/><br/>I am going of myself because I choose to, but you've all been<br/>hauled there by Alexey Karamazov- there's a difference, you know.<br/>And how do you know? I may not be going to make it up at all. It's<br/>a stupid expression."<br/><br/>"It's not Karamazov at all; it's not his doing. Our fellows<br/>began going there of themselves. Of course, they went with<br/>Karamazov at first. And there's been nothing of that sort of<br/>silliness. First one went, and then another. His father was awfully<br/>pleased to see us. You know he will simply go out of his mind if<br/>Ilusha dies. He sees that Ilusha's dying. And he seems so glad<br/>we've made it up with Ilusha. Ilusha asked after you, that was all.<br/>He just asks and says no more. His father will go out of his mind<br/>or hang himself. He behaved like a madman before. You know he is a<br/>very decent man. We made a mistake then. It's all the fault of that<br/>murderer who beat him then."<br/><br/>"Karamazov's a riddle to me all the same. I might have made his<br/>acquaintance long ago, but I like to have a proper pride in some<br/>cases. Besides, I have a theory about him which I must work out and<br/>verify."<br/><br/>Kolya subsided into dignified silence. Smurov, too, was silent.<br/>Smurov, of course, worshipped Krassotkin and never dreamed of<br/>putting himself on a level with him. Now he was tremendously<br/>interested at Kolya's saying that he was "going of himself" to see<br/>Ilusha. He felt that there must be some mystery in Kolya's suddenly<br/>taking it into his head to go to him that day. They crossed the<br/>market-place, in which at that hour were many loaded wagons from<br/>the country and a great number of live fowls. The market women were<br/>selling rolls, cottons and threads, etc., in their booths. These<br/>Sunday markets were naively called "fairs" in the town, and there<br/>were many such fairs in the year.<br/><br/>Perezvon ran about in the wildest spirits, sniffing about first<br/>one side, then the other. When he met other dogs they zealously<br/>smelt each other over according to the rules of canine<br/>etiquette.<br/>
