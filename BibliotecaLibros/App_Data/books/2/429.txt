"And what's your Tchizhov to do with me, good people, eh?"

"How can I tell what he's to do with you?" put in another. "You
ought to know yourself what you want with him, if you make such a
clamour about him. He spoke to you, he did not speak to us, you
stupid. Don't you really know him?"

"Know whom?"

"Tchizhov."

"The devil take Tchizhov and you with him. I'll give him a
hiding, that I will. He was laughing at me!"

"Will give Tchizhov a hiding! More likely he will give you one.
You are a fool, that's what you are!"

"Not Tchizhov, not Tchizhov, you spiteful, mischievous woman.
I'll give the boy a hiding. Catch him, catch him, he was laughing
at me

The woman guffawed. But Kolya was by now a long way off,
marching along with a triumphant air. Smurov walked beside him,
looking round at the shouting group far behind. He too was in high
spirits, though he was still afraid of getting into some scrape in
Kolya's company.

"What Sabaneyev did you mean?" he asked Kolya, foreseeing what
his answer would be.

"How do I know? Now there'll be a hubbub among them all day. I
like to stir up fools in every class of society. There's another
blockhead, that peasant there. You know, they say 'there's no one
stupider than a stupid Frenchman,' but a stupid Russian shows it in
his face just as much. Can't you see it all over his face that he
is a fool, that peasant, eh?"

"Let him alone, Kolya. Let's go on."
