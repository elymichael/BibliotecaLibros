Ilusha's Funeral. The Speech at the Stone


HE really was late. They had waited for him and had already
decided to bear the pretty flower-decked little coffin to the
church without him. It was the coffin of poor little Ilusha. He had
died two days after Mitya was sentenced. At the gate of the house
Alyosha was met by the shouts of the boys, Ilusha's schoolfellows.
They had all been impatiently expecting him and were glad that he
had come at last. There were about twelve of them, they all had
their school-bags or satchels on their shoulders. "Father will cry,
be with father," Ilusha had told them as he lay dying, and the boys
remembered it. Kolya Krassotkin was the foremost of them.

"How glad I am you've come, Karamazov!" he cried, holding out
his hand to Alyosha. "It's awful here. It's really horrible to see
it. Snegiryov is not drunk, we know for a fact he's had nothing to
drink to-day, but he seems as if he were drunkâ€¦ I am always manly,
but this is awful. Karamazov, if I am not keeping you, one question
before you go in?"

"What is it, Kolya?" said Alyosha.

"Is your brother innocent or guilty? Was it he killed your
father or was it the valet? As you say, so it will be. I haven't
slept for the last four nights for thinking of it."

"The valet killed him, my brother is innocent," answered
Alyosha.

"That's what I said," cried Smurov.

"So he will perish an innocent victim!" exclaimed Kolya; "though
he is ruined he is happy! I could envy him!"
