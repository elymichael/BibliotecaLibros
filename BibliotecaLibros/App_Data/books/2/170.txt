"It must be lovely, a duel," Marya Kondratyevna observed
suddenly.

"How so?"

"It must be so dreadful and so brave, especially when young
officers with pistols in their hands pop at one another for the
sake of some lady. A perfect picture! Ah, if only girls were
allowed to look on, I'd give anything to see one!"

"It's all very well when you are firing at someone, but when he
is firing straight in your mug, you must feel pretty silly. You'd
be glad to run away, Marya Kondratyevna."

"You don't mean you would run away?" But Smerdyakov did not
deign to reply. After a moment's silence the guitar tinkled again,
and he sang again in the same falsetto:

Whatever you may say,

I shall go far away.

Life will be bright and gay

In the city far away.

I shall not grieve,

I shall not grieve at all,
