<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>5<br/>A<br/>Sudden Resolution<br/><br/><br/>SHE was sitting in the kitchen with her grandmother; they were<br/>both just going to bed. Relying on Nazar Ivanovitch, they had not<br/>locked themselves in. Mitya ran in, pounced on Fenya and seized her<br/>by the throat.<br/><br/>"Speak at once! Where is she? With whom is she now, at Mokroe?"<br/>he roared furiously.<br/><br/>Both the women squealed.<br/><br/>"Aie! I'll tell you. Aie! Dmitri Fyodorovitch, darling, I'll<br/>tell you everything directly, I won't hide anything," gabbled<br/>Fenya, frightened to death; "she's gone to Mokroe, to her<br/>officer."<br/><br/>"What officer?" roared Mitya.<br/><br/>"To her officer, the same one she used to know, the one who<br/>threw her over five years ago," cackled Fenya, as fast as she could<br/>speak.<br/><br/>Mitya withdrew the hands with which he was squeezing her throat.<br/>He stood facing her, pale as death, unable to utter a word, but his<br/>eyes showed that he realised it all, all, from the first word, and<br/>guessed the whole position. Poor Fenya was not in a condition at<br/>that moment to observe whether he understood or not. She remained<br/>sitting on the trunk as she had been when he ran into the room,<br/>trembling all over, holding her hands out before her as though<br/>trying to defend herself. She seemed to have grown rigid in that<br/>position. Her wide-opened, scared eyes were fixed immovably upon<br/>him. And to make matters worse, both his hands were smeared with<br/>blood. On the way, as he ran, he must have touched his forehead<br/>with them, wiping off the perspiration, so that on his forehead and<br/>his right cheek were bloodstained patches. Fenya was on the verge<br/>of hysterics. The old cook had jumped up and was staring at him<br/>like a mad woman, almost unconscious with terror.<br/>
