(a) Father Zossima's Brother.<br/><br/>Beloved fathers and teachers, I was born in a distant province<br/>in the north, in the town of V. My father was a gentleman by birth,<br/>but of no great consequence or position. He died when I was only<br/>two years old, and I don't remember him at all. He left my mother a<br/>small house built of wood, and a fortune, not large, but sufficient<br/>to keep her and her children in comfort. There were two of us, my<br/>elder brother Markel and I. He was eight years older than I was, of<br/>hasty, irritable temperament, but kind-hearted and never ironical.<br/>He was remarkably silent, especially at home with me, his mother,<br/>and the servants. He did well at school, but did not get on with<br/>his school-fellows, though he never quarrelled, at least so my<br/>mother has told me. Six months before his death, when he was<br/>seventeen, he made friends with a political exile who had been<br/>banished from Moscow to our town for freethinking, and led a<br/>solitary existence there. He was a good scholar who had gained<br/>distinction in philosophy in the university. Something made him<br/>take a fancy to Markel, and he used to ask him to see him. The<br/>young man would spend whole evenings with him during that winter,<br/>till the exile was summoned to Petersburg to take up his post again<br/>at his own request, as he had powerful friends.<br/><br/>It was the beginning of Lent, and Markel would not fast, he was<br/>rude and laughed at it. "That's all silly twaddle, and there is no<br/>God," he said, horrifying my mother, the servants, and me too. For<br/>though I was only nine, I too was aghast at hearing such words. We<br/>had four servants, all serfs. I remember my mother selling one of<br/>the four, the cook Afimya, who was lame and elderly, for sixty<br/>paper roubles, and hiring a free servant to take her place.<br/><br/>In the sixth week in Lent, my brother, who was never strong and<br/>had a tendency to consumption, was taken ill. He was tall but thin<br/>and delicate-looking, and of very pleasing countenance. I suppose<br/>he caught cold, anyway the doctor, who came, soon whispered to my<br/>mother that it was galloping consumption, that he would not live<br/>through the spring. My mother began weeping, and, careful not to<br/>alarm my brother, she entreated him to go to church, to confess and<br/>take the sacrament, as he was still able to move about. This made<br/>him angry, and he said something profane about the church. He grew<br/>thoughtful, however; he guessed at once that he was seriously ill,<br/>and that that was why his mother was begging him to confess and<br/>take the sacrament. He had been aware, indeed, for a long time<br/>past, that he was far from well, and had a year before coolly<br/>observed at dinner to your mother and me, "My life won't be long<br/>among you, I may not live another year," which seemed now like a<br/>prophecy.<br/><br/>Three days passed and Holy Week had come. And on Tuesday morning<br/>my brother began going to church. "I am doing this simply for your<br/>sake, mother, to please and comfort you," he said. My mother wept<br/>with joy and grief. "His end must be near," she thought, "if<br/>there's such a change in him." But he was not able to go to church<br/>long, he took to his bed, so he had to confess and take the<br/>sacrament at home.<br/><br/>It was a late Easter, and the days were bright, fine, and full<br/>of fragrance. I remember he used to cough all night and sleep<br/>badly, but in the morning he dressed and tried to sit up in an<br/>arm-chair. That's how I remember him sitting, sweet and gentle,<br/>smiling, his face bright and joyous, in spite of his illness. A<br/>marvellous change passed over him, his spirit seemed transformed.<br/>The old nurse would come in and say, "Let me light the lamp before<br/>the holy image, my dear." And once he would not have allowed it and<br/>would have blown it out.<br/><br/>"Light it, light it, dear, I was a wretch to have prevented you<br/>doing it. You are praying when you light the lamp, and I am praying<br/>when I rejoice seeing you. So we are praying to the same God."<br/><br/>Those words seemed strange to us, and mother would go to her<br/>room and weep, but when she went in to him she wiped her eyes and<br/>looked cheerful. "Mother, don't weep, darling," he would say, "I've<br/>long to live yet, long to rejoice with you, and life is glad and<br/>joyful."<br/><br/>"Ah, dear boy, how can you talk of joy when you lie feverish at<br/>night, coughing as though you would tear yourself to pieces."<br/><br/>"Don't cry, mother," he would answer, "life is paradise, and we<br/>are all in paradise, but we won't see it; if we would, we should<br/>have heaven on earth the next day."<br/><br/>Everyone wondered at his words, he spoke so strangely and<br/>positively; we were all touched and wept. Friends came to see us.<br/>"Dear ones," he would say to them, "what have I done that you<br/>should love me so, how can you love anyone like me, and how was it<br/>I did not know, I did not appreciate it before?"<br/>
