<br/>At the sight of Grushenka, Mitya's jealousy vanished, and, for<br/>an instant he became trustful and generous, and positively despised<br/>himself for his evil feelings. But it only proved that, in his love<br/>for the woman, there was an element of something far higher than he<br/>himself imagined, that it was not only a sensual passion, not only<br/>the "curve of her body," of which he had talked to Alyosha. But, as<br/>soon as Grushenka had gone, Mitya began to suspect her of all the<br/>low cunning of faithlessness, and he felt no sting of conscience at<br/>it.<br/><br/>And so jealousy surged up in him again. He had, in any case, to<br/>make haste. The first thing to be done was to get hold of at least<br/>a small, temporary loan of money. The nine roubles had almost all<br/>gone on his expedition. And, as we all know, one can't take a step<br/>without money. But he had thought over in the cart where he could<br/>get a loan. He had a brace of fine duelling pistols in a case,<br/>which he had not pawned till then because he prized them above all<br/>his possessions.<br/><br/>In the Metropolis tavern he had some time since made<br/>acquaintance with a young official and had learnt that this very<br/>opulent bachelor was passionately fond of weapons. He used to buy<br/>pistols, revolvers, daggers, hang them on his wall and show them to<br/>acquaintances. He prided himself on them, and was quite a<br/>specialist on the mechanism of the revolver. Mitya, without<br/>stopping to think, went straight to him, and offered to pawn his<br/>pistols to him for ten roubles. The official, delighted, began<br/>trying to persuade him to sell them outright. But Mitya would not<br/>consent, so the young man gave him ten roubles, protesting that<br/>nothing would induce him to take interest. They parted friends.<br/><br/>Mitya was in haste; he rushed towards Fyodor Pavlovitch's by the<br/>back way, to his arbour, to get hold of Smerdyakov as soon as<br/>possible. In this way the fact was established that three or four<br/>hours before a certain event, of which I shall speak later on,<br/>Mitya had not a farthing, and pawned for ten roubles a possession<br/>he valued, though, three hours later, he was in possession of<br/>thousands… . But I am anticipating. From Marya Kondratyevna (the<br/>woman living near Fyodor Pavlovitch's) he learned the very<br/>disturbing fact of Smerdyakov's illness. He heard the story of his<br/>fall in the cellar, his fit, the doctor's visit, Fyodor<br/>Pavlovitch's anxiety; he heard with interest, too, that his brother<br/>Ivan had set off that morning for Moscow.<br/><br/>"Then he must have driven through Volovya before me," thought<br/>Dmitri, but he was terribly distressed about Smerdyakov. "What will<br/>happen now? Who'll keep watch for me? Who'll bring me word?" he<br/>thought. He began greedily questioning the women whether they had<br/>seen anything the evening before. They quite understood what he was<br/>trying to find out, and completely reassured him. No one had been<br/>there. Ivan Fyodorovitch had been there that night; everything had<br/>been perfectly as usual. Mitya grew thoughtful. He would certainly<br/>have to keep watch to-day, but where? Here or at Samsonov's gate?<br/>He decided that he must be on the lookout both here and there, and<br/>meanwhile… meanwhile… The difficulty was that he had to carry out<br/>the new plan that he had made on the journey back. He was sure of<br/>its success, but he must not delay acting upon it. Mitya resolved<br/>to sacrifice an hour to it: "In an hour I shall know everything, I<br/>shall settle everything, and then, then, then, first of all to<br/>Samsonov's. I'll inquire whether Grushenka's there and instantly be<br/>back here again, stay till eleven, and then to Samsonov's again to<br/>bring her home." This was what he decided.<br/><br/>He flew home, washed, combed his hair, brushed his clothes,<br/>dressed, and went to Madame Hohlakov's. Alas! he had built his<br/>hopes on her. He had resolved to borrow three thousand from that<br/>lady. And what was more, he felt suddenly convinced that she would<br/>not refuse to lend it to him. It may be wondered why, if he felt so<br/>certain, he had not gone to her at first, one of his own sort, so<br/>to speak, instead of to Samsonov, a man he did not know, who was<br/>not of his own class, and to whom he hardly knew how to speak.<br/><br/>But the fact was that he had never known Madame Hohlakov well,<br/>and had seen nothing of her for the last month, and that he knew<br/>she could not endure him. She had detested him from the first<br/>because he was engaged to Katerina Ivanovna, while she had, for<br/>some reason, suddenly conceived the desire that Katerina Ivanovna<br/>should throw him over, and marry the "charming, chivalrously<br/>refined Ivan, who had such excellent manners." Mitya's manners she<br/>detested. Mitya positively laughed at her, and had once said about<br/>her that she was just as lively and at her ease as she was<br/>uncultivated. But that morning in the cart a brilliant idea had<br/>struck him: "If she is so anxious I should not marry Katerina<br/>Ivanovna" (and he knew she was positively hysterical upon the<br/>subject) "why should she refuse me now that three thousand, just to<br/>enable me to leave Katya and get away from her for ever. These<br/>spoilt fine ladies, if they set their hearts on anything, will<br/>spare no expense to satisfy their caprice. Besides, she's so rich,"<br/>Mitya argued.<br/><br/>As for his "plan" it was just the same as before; it consisted<br/>of the offer of his rights to Tchermashnya- but not with a<br/>commercial object, as it had been with Samsonov, not trying to<br/>allure the lady with the possibility of making a profit of six or<br/>seven thousand- but simply as a security for the debt. As he worked<br/>out this new idea, Mitya was enchanted with it, but so it always<br/>was with him in all his undertakings, in all his sudden decisions.<br/>He gave himself up to every new idea with passionate enthusiasm.<br/>Yet, when he mounted the steps of Madame Hohlakov's house he felt a<br/>shiver of fear run down his spine. At that moment he saw fully, as<br/>a mathematical certainty, that this was his last hope, that if this<br/>broke down, nothing else was left him in the world but to "rob and<br/>murder someone for the three thousand." It was half-past seven when<br/>he rang at the bell.<br/><br/>At first fortune seemed to smile upon him. As soon as he was<br/>announced he was received with extraordinary rapidity. "As though<br/>she were waiting for me," thought Mitya, and as soon as he had been<br/>led to the drawing-room, the lady of the house herself ran in, and<br/>declared at once that she was expecting him.<br/><br/>"I was expecting you! I was expecting you! Though I'd no reason<br/>to suppose you would come to see me, as you will admit yourself.<br/>Yet, I did expect you. You may marvel at my instinct, Dmitri<br/>Fyodorovitch, but I was convinced all the morning that you would<br/>come."<br/><br/>
