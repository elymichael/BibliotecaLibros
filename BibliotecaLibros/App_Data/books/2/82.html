<br/>"No one else. He will let me know if she goes to the old<br/>man."<br/><br/>"It was he told you about the money, then?"<br/><br/>"Yes. It's a dead secret. Even Ivan doesn't know about the<br/>money, or anything. The old man is sending Ivan to Tchermashnya on<br/>a two or three days' journey. A purchaser has turned up for the<br/>copse: he'll give eight thousand for the timber. So the old man<br/>keeps asking Ivan to help him by going to arrange it. It will take<br/>him two or three days. That's what the old man wants, so that<br/>Grushenka can come while he's away."<br/><br/>"Then he's expecting Grushenka to-day?"<br/><br/>"No, she won't come to-day; there are signs, She's certain not<br/>to come," cried Mitya suddenly. "Smerdyakov thinks so, too.<br/>Father's drinking now. He's sitting at table with Ivan. Go to him,<br/>Alyosha, and ask for the three thousand."<br/><br/>"Mitya, dear, what's the matter with you?" cried Alyosha,<br/>jumping up from his place, and looking keenly at his brother's<br/>frenzied face. For one moment the thought struck him that Dmitri<br/>was mad.<br/><br/>"What is it? I'm not insane," said Dmitri, looking intently and<br/>earnestly at him. "No fear. I am sending you to father, and I know<br/>what I'm saying. I believe in miracles."<br/><br/>"In miracles?"<br/><br/>"In a miracle of Divine Providence. God knows my heart. He sees<br/>my despair. He sees the whole picture. Surely He won't let<br/>something awful happen. Alyosha, I believe in miracles. Go!"<br/><br/>"I am going. Tell me, will you wait for me here?"<br/><br/>
