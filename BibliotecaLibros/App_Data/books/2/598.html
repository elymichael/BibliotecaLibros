<br/>They reached the church at last and set the coffin in the middle<br/>of it. The boys surrounded it and remained reverently standing so,<br/>all through the service. It was an old and rather poor church; many<br/>of the ikons were without settings; but such churches are the best<br/>for praying in. During the mass Snegiryov became somewhat calmer,<br/>though at times he had outbursts of the same unconscious and, as it<br/>were, incoherent anxiety. At one moment he went up to the coffin to<br/>set straight the cover or the wreath, when a candle fell out of the<br/>candlestick he rushed to replace it and was a fearful time fumbling<br/>over it, then he subsided and stood quietly by the coffin with a<br/>look of blank uneasiness and perplexity. After the Epistle he<br/>suddenly whispered to Alyosha, who was standing beside him, that<br/>the Epistle had not been read properly but did not explain what he<br/>meant. During the prayer, "Like the Cherubim," he joined in the<br/>singing but did not go on to the end. Falling on his knees, he<br/>pressed his forehead to the stone floor and lay so for a long<br/>while.<br/><br/>At last came the funeral service itself and candles were<br/>distributed. The distracted father began fussing about again, but<br/>the touching and impressive funeral prayers moved and roused his<br/>soul. He seemed suddenly to shrink together and broke into rapid,<br/>short sobs, which he tried at first to smother, but at last he<br/>sobbed aloud. When they began taking leave of the dead and closing<br/>the coffin, he flung his arms about, as though he would not allow<br/>them to cover Ilusha, and began greedily and persistently kissing<br/>his dead boy on the lips. At last they succeeded in persuading him<br/>to come away from the step, but suddenly he impulsively stretched<br/>out his hand and snatched a few flowers from the coffin. He looked<br/>at them and a new idea seemed to dawn upon him, so that he<br/>apparently forgot his grief for a minute. Gradually he seemed to<br/>sink into brooding and did not resist when the coffin was lifted up<br/>and carried to the grave. It was an expensive one in the churchyard<br/>close to the church, Katerina Ivanovna had paid for it. After the<br/>customary rites the grave-diggers lowered the coffin. Snegiryov<br/>with his flowers in his hands bent down so low over the open grave<br/>that the boys caught hold of his coat in alarm and pulled him back.<br/>He did not seem to understand fully what was happening. When they<br/>began filling up the grave, he suddenly pointed anxiously at the<br/>falling earth and began trying to say something, but no one could<br/>make out what he meant, and he stopped suddenly. Then he was<br/>reminded that he must crumble the bread and he was awfully excited,<br/>snatched up the bread and began pulling it to pieces- and flinging<br/>the morsels on the grave.<br/><br/>"Come, fly down, birds, fly down, sparrows!" he muttered<br/>anxiously.<br/><br/>One of the boys observed that it was awkward for him to crumble<br/>the bread with the flowers in his hands and suggested he should<br/>give them to someone to hold for a time. But he would not do this<br/>and seemed indeed suddenly alarmed for his flowers, as though they<br/>wanted to take them from him altogether. And after looking at the<br/>grave, and as it were, satisfying himself that everything had been<br/>done and the bread had been crumbled, he suddenly, to the surprise<br/>of everyone, turned, quite composedly even, and made his way<br/>homewards. But his steps became more and more hurried, he almost<br/>ran. The boys and Alyosha kept up with him.<br/><br/>"The flowers are for mamma, the flowers are for mamma! I was<br/>unkind to mamma," he began exclaiming suddenly.<br/><br/>Someone called to him to put on his hat as it was cold. But he<br/>flung the hat in the snow as though he were angry and kept<br/>repeating, "I won't have the hat, I won't have the hat." Smurov<br/>picked it up and carried it after him. All the boys were crying,<br/>and Kolya and the boy who discovered about Troy most of all. Though<br/>Smurov, with the captain's hat in his hand, was crying bitterly<br/>too, he managed, as he ran, to snatch up a piece of red brick that<br/>lay on the snow of the path, to fling it at the flock of sparrows<br/>that was flying by. He missed them, of course, and went on crying<br/>as he ran. Half-way, Snegiryov suddenly stopped, stood still for<br/>half a minute, as though struck by something, and suddenly turning<br/>back to the church, ran towards the deserted grave. But the boys<br/>instantly overtook him and caught hold of him on all sides. Then he<br/>fell helpless on the snow as though he had been knocked down, and<br/>struggling, sobbing, and wailing, he began crying out, "Ilusha, old<br/>man, dear old man!" Alyosha and Kolya tried to make him get up,<br/>soothing and persuading him.<br/><br/>"Captain, give over, a brave man must show fortitude," muttered<br/>Kolya.<br/><br/>"You'll spoil the flowers," said Alyosha, and mamma is expecting<br/>them, she is sitting crying because you would not give her any<br/>before. Ilusha's little bed is still there-"<br/><br/>"Yes, yes, mamma!" Snegiryov suddenly recollected, "they'll take<br/>away the bed, they'll take it away," he added as though alarmed<br/>that they really would. He jumped up and ran homewards again. But<br/>it was not far off and they all arrived together. Snegiryov opened<br/>the door hurriedly and called to his wife with whom he had so<br/>cruelly quarrelled just before:<br/><br/>"Mamma, poor crippled darling, Ilusha has sent you these<br/>flowers," he cried, holding out to her a little bunch of flowers<br/>that had been frozen and broken while he was struggling in the<br/>snow. But at that instant he saw in the corner, by the little bed,<br/>Ilusha's little boots, which the landlady had put tidily side by<br/>side. Seeing the old, patched, rusty-looking, stiff boots he flung<br/>up his hands and rushed to them, fell on his knees, snatched up one<br/>boot and, pressing his lips to it, began kissing it greedily,<br/>crying, "Ilusha, old man, dear old man, where are your little<br/>feet?"<br/><br/>
