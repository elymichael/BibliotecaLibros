<br/>But the unexpected pronouncement of Doctor Varvinsky gave the<br/>last touch of comedy to the difference of opinion between the<br/>experts. In his opinion the prisoner was now, and had been all<br/>along, in a perfectly normal condition, and, although he certainly<br/>must have been in a nervous and exceedingly excited state before<br/>his arrest, this might have been due to several perfectly obvious<br/>causes, jealousy, anger, continual drunkenness, and so on. But this<br/>nervous condition would not involve the mental abberation of which<br/>mention had just been made. As to the question whether the prisoner<br/>should have looked to the left or to the right on entering the<br/>court, "in his modest opinion," the prisoner would naturally look<br/>straight before him on entering the court, as he had in fact done,<br/>as that was where the judges, on whom his fate depended, were<br/>sitting. So that it was just by looking straight before him that he<br/>showed his perfectly normal state of mind at the present. The young<br/>doctor concluded his "modest" testimony with some heat.<br/><br/>"Bravo, doctor!" cried Mitya, from his seat, "just so!"<br/><br/>Mitya, of course, was checked, but the young doctor's opinion<br/>had a decisive influence on the judges and on the public, and, as<br/>appeared afterwards, everyone agreed with him. But Doctor<br/>Herzenstube, when called as a witness, was quite unexpectedly of<br/>use to Mitya. As an old resident in the town, who had known the<br/>Karamazov family for years, he furnished some facts of great value<br/>for the prosecution, and suddenly, as though recalling something,<br/>he added:<br/><br/>"But the poor young man might have had a very different life,<br/>for he had a good heart both in childhood and after childhood, that<br/>I know. But the Russian proverb says, 'If a man has one head, it's<br/>good, but if another clever man comes to visit him, it would be<br/>better still, for then there will be two heads and not only<br/>one."'<br/><br/>"One head is good, but two are better," the prosecutor put in<br/>impatiently. He knew the old man's habit of talking slowly and<br/>deliberately, regardless of the impression he was making and of the<br/>delay he was causing, and highly prizing his flat, dull and always<br/>gleefully complacent German wit. The old man was fond of making<br/>jokes.<br/><br/>"Oh, yes, that's what I say," he went on stubbornly. "One head<br/>is good, but two are much better, but he did not meet another head<br/>with wits, and his wits went. Where did they go? I've forgotten the<br/>word." He went on, passing his hand before his eyes, "Oh, yes,<br/>spazieren."<br/><br/>Promenading.<br/><br/>"Wandering?"<br/><br/>"Oh, yes, wandering, that's what I say. Well, his wits went<br/>wandering and fell in such a deep hole that he lost himself. And<br/>yet he was a grateful and sensitive boy. Oh, I remember him very<br/>well, a little chap so high, left neglected by his father in the<br/>back yard, when he ran about without boots on his feet, and his<br/>little breeches hanging by one button."<br/><br/>A note of feeling and tenderness suddenly came into the honest<br/>old man's voice. Fetyukovitch positively started, as though<br/>scenting something, and caught at it instantly.<br/><br/>
