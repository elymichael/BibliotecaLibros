And would cause me many a tear.<br/><br/>And many more men come to try their luck, among them a<br/>soldier:<br/><br/>The soldier came to try the girls:<br/><br/>Would they love him, would they not?<br/><br/>But the soldier is rejected with contempt, in two indecent<br/>lines, sung with absolute frankness and producing a furore in the<br/>audience.
