"Yes, universal history! It's the study of the successive<br/>follies of mankind and nothing more. The only subjects I respect<br/>are mathematics and natural science," said Kolya. He was showing<br/>off and he stole a glance at Alyosha; his was the only opinion he<br/>was afraid of there. But Alyosha was still silent and still serious<br/>as before. If Alyosha had said a word it would have stopped him,<br/>but Alyosha was silent and "it might be the silence of contempt,"<br/>and that finally irritated Kolya.<br/><br/>"The classical languages, too… they are simply madness, nothing<br/>more. You seem to disagree with me again, Karamazov?"<br/><br/>"I don't agree," said Alyosha, with a faint smile.<br/><br/>"The study of the classics, if you ask my opinion, is simply a<br/>police measure, that's simply why it has been introduced into our<br/>schools." By degrees Kolya began to get breathless again. "Latin<br/>and Greek were introduced because they are a bore and because they<br/>stupefy the intellect. It was dull before, so what could they do to<br/>make things duller? It was senseless enough before, so what could<br/>they do to make it more senseless? So they thought of Greek and<br/>Latin. That's my opinion, I hope I shall never change it," Kolya<br/>finished abruptly. His cheeks were flushed.<br/><br/>"That's true," assented Smurov suddenly, in a ringing tone of<br/>conviction. He had listened attentively.<br/><br/>"And yet he is first in Latin himself," cried one of the group<br/>of boys suddenly.<br/><br/>"Yes, father, he says that and yet he is first in Latin," echoed<br/>Ilusha.<br/><br/>"What of it?" Kolya thought fit to defend himself, though the<br/>praise was very sweet to him. "I am fagging away at Latin because I<br/>have to, because I promised my mother to pass my examination, and I<br/>think that whatever you do, it's worth doing it well. But in my<br/>soul I have a profound contempt for the classics and all that<br/>fraud… . You don't agree, Karamazov?"<br/><br/>"Why 'fraud'?" Alyosha smiled again.<br/><br/>"Well, all the classical authors have been translated into all<br/>languages, so it was not for the sake of studying the classics they<br/>introduced Latin, but solely as a police measure, to stupefy the<br/>intelligence. So what can one call it but a fraud?"<br/><br/>"Why, who taught you all this?" cried Alyosha, surprised at<br/>last.<br/>
