Over the Brandy


THE controversy was over. But, strange to say, Fyodor
Pavlovitch, who had been so gay, suddenly began frowning. He
frowned and gulped brandy, and it was already a glass too much.

"Get along with you, Jesuits!" he cried to the servants. "Go
away, Smerdyakov. I'll send you the gold piece I promised you
to-day, but be off! Don't cry, Grigory. Go to Marfa. She'll comfort
you and put you to bed. The rascals won't let us sit in peace after
dinner," he snapped peevishly, as the servants promptly withdrew at
his word.

"Smerdyakov always pokes himself in now, after dinner. It's you
he's so interested in. What have you done to fascinate him?" he
added to Ivan.

"Nothing whatever," answered Ivan. "He's pleased to have a high
opinion of me; he's a lackey and a mean soul. Raw material for
revolution, however, when the time comes."

"There will be others and better ones. But there will be some
like him as well. His kind will come first, and better ones
after."

"And when will the time come?"

"The rocket will go off and fizzle out, perhaps. The peasants
are not very fond of listening to these soup-makers, so far."
