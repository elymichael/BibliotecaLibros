<br/>"Well, yes, it does."<br/><br/>"Ech, what a life!" The peasant heaved a sigh from the bottom of<br/>his heart.<br/><br/>"Good-bye, Matvey."<br/><br/>"Good-bye. You are a nice chap, that you are."<br/><br/>The boys went on.<br/><br/>"That was a nice peasant," Kolya observed to Smurov. "I like<br/>talking to the peasants, and am always glad to do them<br/>justice."<br/><br/>"Why did you tell a lie, pretending we are thrashed?" asked<br/>Smurov.<br/><br/>"I had to say that to please him."<br/><br/>"How do you mean?"<br/><br/>"You know, Smurov, I don't like being asked the same thing<br/>twice. I like people to understand at the first word. Some things<br/>can't be explained. According to a peasant's notions, schoolboys<br/>are whipped, and must be whipped. What would a schoolboy be if he<br/>were not whipped? And if I were to tell him we are not, he'd be<br/>disappointed. But you don't understand that. One has to know how to<br/>talk to the peasants."<br/><br/>
