"Well, gentlemen, I admit it was eloquent. But still it's not<br/>the thing to break your father's head with a pestle! Or what are we<br/>coming to?"<br/><br/>"The chariot! Do you remember the chariot?"<br/><br/>"Yes; he turned a cart into a chariot!"<br/><br/>"And to-morrow he will turn a chariot into a cart, just to suit<br/>his purpose."<br/><br/>"What cunning chaps there are nowadays! Is there any justice to<br/>be had in Russia?"<br/><br/>But the bell rang. The jury deliberated for exactly an hour,<br/>neither more nor less. A profound silence reigned in the court as<br/>soon as the public had taken their seats. I remember how the<br/>jurymen walked into the court. At last! I won't repeat the<br/>questions in order, and, indeed, I have forgotten them. I remember<br/>only the answer to the President's first and chief question: "Did<br/>the prisoner commit the murder for the sake of robbery and with<br/>premeditation?" (I don't remember the exact words.) There was a<br/>complete hush. The foreman of the jury, the youngest of the clerks,<br/>pronounced, in a clear, loud voice, amidst the deathlike stillness<br/>of the court:<br/><br/>"Yes, guilty!"<br/><br/>And the same answer was repeated to every question: "Yes,<br/>guilty!" and without the slightest extenuating comment. This no one<br/>had expected; almost everyone had reckoned upon a recommendation to<br/>mercy, at least. The death-like silence in the court was not<br/>broken- all seemed petrified: those who desired his conviction as<br/>well as those who had been eager for his acquittal. But that was<br/>only for the first instant, and it was followed by a fearful<br/>hubbub. Many of the men in the audience were pleased. Some were<br/>rubbing their hands with no attempt to conceal their joy. Those who<br/>disagreed with the verdict seemed crushed, shrugged their<br/>shoulders, whispered, but still seemed unable to realise this. But<br/>how shall I describe the state the ladies were in? I thought they<br/>would create a riot. At first they could scarcely believe their<br/>ears. Then suddenly the whole court rang with exclamations: "What's<br/>the meaning of it? What next?" They leapt up from their places.<br/>They seemed to fancy that it might be at once reconsidered and<br/>reversed. At that instant Mitya suddenly stood up and cried in a<br/>heart-rending voice, stretching his hands out before him:<br/><br/>"I swear by God and the dreadful Day of Judgment I am not guilty<br/>of my father's blood! Katya, I forgive you! Brothers, friends, have<br/>pity on the other woman!"<br/><br/>He could not go on, and broke into a terrible sobbing wail that<br/>was heard all over the court in a strange, unnatural voice unlike<br/>his own. From the farthest corner at the back of the gallery came a<br/>piercing shriek- it was Grushenka. She had succeeded in begging<br/>admittance to the court again before the beginning of the lawyers'<br/>speeches. Mitya was taken away. The passing of the sentence was<br/>deferred till next day. The whole court was in a hubbub but I did<br/>not wait to hear. I only remember a few exclamations I heard on the<br/>steps as I went out.<br/><br/>"He'll have a twenty years' trip to the mines!"<br/>
