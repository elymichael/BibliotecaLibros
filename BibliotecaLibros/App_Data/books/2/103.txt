"Brother, how will all this horror end between father and
Dmitri?" exclaimed Alyosha.

"One can't tell for certain. Perhaps in nothing: it may all
fizzle out. That woman is a beast. In any case we must keep the old
man indoors and not let Dmitri in the house."

"Brother, let me ask one thing more: has any man a right to look
at other men and decide which is worthy to live?"

"Why bring in the question of worth? The matter is most often
decided in men's hearts on other grounds much more natural. And as
for rights- who has not the right to wish?"

"Not for another man's death?"

"What even if for another man's death? Why lie to oneself since
all men live so and perhaps cannot help living so. Are you
referring to what I said just now- that one reptile will devour the
other? In that case let me ask you, do you think me like Dmitri
capable of shedding Aesop's blood, murdering him, eh?"

"What are you saying, Ivan? Such an idea never crossed my mind.
I don't think Dmitri is capable of it, either."

"Thanks, if only for that," smiled Ivan. "Be sure, I should
always defend him. But in my wishes I reserve myself full latitude
in this case. Good-bye till to-morrow. Don't condemn me, and don't
look on me as a villain," he added with a smile.

They shook hands warmly as they had never done before. Alyosha
felt that his brother had taken the first step towards him, and
that he had certainly done this with some definite motive.
