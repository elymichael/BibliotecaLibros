"It's true, I did. I told the whole town so, and the whole town<br/>said so. And here, at Mokroe, too, everyone reckoned it was three<br/>thousand. Yet I didn't spend three thousand, but fifteen hundred.<br/>And the other fifteen hundred I sewed into a little bag. That's how<br/>it was, gentlemen. That's where I got that money yesterday… ."<br/><br/>"This is almost miraculous," murmured Nikolay Parfenovitch.<br/><br/>"Allow me to inquire," observed the prosecutor at last, "have<br/>you informed anyone whatever of this circumstance before; I mean<br/>that you had fifteen hundred left about you a month ago?"<br/><br/>"I told no one."<br/><br/>"That's strange. Do you mean absolutely no one?"<br/><br/>"Absolutely no one. No one and nobody."<br/><br/>"What was your reason for this reticence? What was your motive<br/>for making such a secret of it? To be more precise: You have told<br/>us at last your secret, in your words, so 'disgraceful,' though in<br/>reality- that is, of course, comparatively speaking- this action,<br/>that is, the appropriation of three thousand roubles belonging to<br/>someone else, and, of course, only for a time is, in my view at<br/>least, only an act of the greatest recklessness and not so<br/>disgraceful, when one takes into consideration your character… .<br/>Even admitting that it was an action in the highest degree<br/>discreditable, still, discreditable is not 'disgraceful.'… Many<br/>people have already guessed, during this last month, about the<br/>three thousand of Katerina Ivanovna's that you have spent, and I<br/>heard the legend myself, apart from your confession… . Mihail<br/>Makarovitch, for instance, had heard it, too, so that indeed, it<br/>was scarcely a legend, but the gossip of the whole town. There are<br/>indications, too, if I am not mistaken, that you confessed this<br/>yourself to someone, I mean that the money was Katerina Ivanovna's,<br/>and so, it's extremely surprising to me that hitherto, that is, up<br/>to the present moment, you have made such an extraordinary secret<br/>of the fifteen hundred you say you put by, apparently connecting a<br/>feeling of positive horror with that secret… . It's not easy to<br/>believe that it could cost you such distress to confess such a<br/>secret… . You cried out, just now, that Siberia would be better<br/>than confessing it… "<br/><br/>The prosecutor ceased speaking. He was provoked. He did not<br/>conceal his vexation, which was almost anger, and gave vent to all<br/>his accumulated spleen, disconnectedly and incoherently, without<br/>choosing words.<br/><br/>"It's not the fifteen hundred that's the disgrace, but that I<br/>put it apart from the rest of the three thousand," said Mitya<br/>firmly.<br/><br/>"Why?" smiled the prosecutor irritably. "What is there<br/>disgraceful, to your thinking, in your having set aside half of the<br/>three thousand you had discreditably, if you prefer,<br/>'disgracefully,' appropriated? Your taking the three thousand is<br/>more important than what you did with it. And by the way, why did<br/>you do that- why did you set apart that half, for what purpose, for<br/>what object did you do it? Can you explain that to us?"<br/><br/>"Oh, gentlemen, the purpose is the whole point!" cried Mitya. "I<br/>put it aside because I was vile, that is, because I was<br/>calculating, and to be calculating in such a case is vile… and that<br/>vileness has been going on a whole month."<br/>
