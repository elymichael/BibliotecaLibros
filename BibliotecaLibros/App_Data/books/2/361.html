<br/>"We quite understand that you made that statement just now<br/>through exasperation with us and the questions we put to you, which<br/>you consider trivial, though they are, in fact, essential," the<br/>prosecutor remarked drily in reply.<br/><br/>"Well, upon my word, gentlemen! Yes, I took the pestle… . What<br/>does one pick things up for at such moments? I don't know what for.<br/>I snatched it up and ran- that's all. For to me, gentlemen,<br/>passons, or I declare I won't tell you any more."<br/><br/>He sat with his elbows on the table and his head in his hand. He<br/>sat sideways to them and gazed at the wall, struggling against a<br/>feeling of nausea. He had, in fact, an awful inclination to get up<br/>and declare that he wouldn't say another word, "not if you hang me<br/>for it."<br/><br/>"You see, gentlemen," he said at last, with difficulty<br/>controlling himself, "you see. I listen to you and am haunted by a<br/>dream… . It's a dream I have sometimes, you know… .

But still you do have curious<br/>dreams."<br/><br/>"It's not a question of dreams now, gentlemen- this is realism,<br/>this is real life! I'm a wolf and you're the hunters. Well, hunt<br/>him down!"<br/><br/>"You are wrong to make such comparisons." began Nikolay<br/>Parfenovitch, with extraordinary softness.<br/><br/>"No, I'm not wrong, at all!" Mitya flared up again, though his<br/>outburst of wrath had obviously relieved his heart. He grew more<br/>good humoured at every word. "You may not trust a criminal or a man<br/>on trial tortured by your questions, but an honourable man, the<br/>honourable impulses of the heart (I say that boldly!)- no!
