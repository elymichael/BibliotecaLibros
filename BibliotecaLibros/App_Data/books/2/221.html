<br/>(f) Of Masters and Servants, and of whether it is<br/><br/>possible for them to be Brothers in the Spirit.<br/><br/>Of course, I don't deny that there is sin in the peasants too.<br/>And the fire of corruption is spreading visibly, hourly, working<br/>from above downwards. The spirit of isolation is coming upon the<br/>people too. Money-lenders and devourers of the commune are rising<br/>up. Already the merchant grows more and more eager for rank, and<br/>strives to show himself cultured though he has not a trace of<br/>culture, and to this end meanly despises his old traditions, and is<br/>even ashamed of the faith of his fathers. He visits princes, though<br/>he is only a peasant corrupted. The peasants are rotting in<br/>drunkenness and cannot shake off the habit. And what cruelty to<br/>their wives, to their children even! All from drunkenness! I've<br/>seen in the factories children of nine years old, frail, rickety,<br/>bent and already depraved. The stuffy workshop, the din of<br/>machinery, work all day long, the vile language and the drink, the<br/>drink- is that what a little child's heart needs? He needs<br/>sunshine, childish play, good examples all about him, and at least<br/>a little love. There must be no more of this, monks, no more<br/>torturing of children, rise up and preach that, make haste, make<br/>haste!<br/><br/>But God will save Russia, for though the peasants are corrupted<br/>and cannot renounce their filthy sin, yet they know it is cursed by<br/>God and that they do wrong in sinning. So that our people still<br/>believe in righteousness, have faith in God and weep tears of<br/>devotion.<br/><br/>It is different with the upper classes. They, following science,<br/>want to base justice on reason alone, but not with Christ, as<br/>before, and they have already proclaimed that there is no crime,<br/>that there is no sin. And that's consistent, for if you have no God<br/>what is the meaning of crime? In Europe the people are already<br/>rising up against the rich with violence, and the leaders of the<br/>people are everywhere leading them to bloodshed, and teaching them<br/>that their wrath is righteous. But their "wrath is accursed, for it<br/>is cruel." But God will save Russia as He has saved her many times.<br/>Salvation will come from the people, from their faith and their<br/>meekness.<br/><br/>Fathers and teachers, watch over the people's faith and this<br/>will not be a dream. I've been struck all my life in our great<br/>people by their dignity, their true and seemly dignity. I've seen<br/>it myself, I can testify to it, I've seen it and marvelled at it,<br/>I've seen it in spite of the degraded sins and poverty-stricken<br/>appearance of our peasantry. They are not servile, and even after<br/>two centuries of serfdom they are free in manner and bearing, yet<br/>without insolence, and not revengeful and not envious. "You are<br/>rich and noble, you are clever and talented, well, be so, God bless<br/>you. I respect you, but I know that I too am a man. By the very<br/>fact that I respect you without envy I prove my dignity as a<br/>man."<br/><br/>In truth if they don't say this (for they don't know how to say<br/>this yet), that is how they act. I have seen it myself, I have<br/>known it myself, and, would you believe it, the poorer our Russian<br/>peasant is, the more noticeable is that serene goodness, for the<br/>rich among them are for the most part corrupted already, and much<br/>of that is due to our carelessness and indifference. But God will<br/>save His people, for Russia is great in her humility. I dream of<br/>seeing, and seem to see clearly already, our future. It will come<br/>to pass that even the most corrupt of our rich will end by being<br/>ashamed of his riches before the poor, and the poor, seeing his<br/>humility, will understand and give way before him, will respond<br/>joyfully and kindly to his honourable shame. Believe me that it<br/>will end in that; things are moving to that. Equality is to be<br/>found only in the spiritual dignity of man, and that will only be<br/>understood among us. If we were brothers, there would be<br/>fraternity, but before that they will never agree about the<br/>division of wealth. We preserve the image of Christ, and it will<br/>shine forth like a precious diamond to the whole world. So may it<br/>be, so may it be!<br/><br/>Fathers and teachers, a touching incident befell me once. In my<br/>wanderings I met in the town of K. my old orderly, Afanasy. It was<br/>eight years since I had parted from him. He chanced to see me in<br/>the market-place, recognised me, ran up to me, and how delighted he<br/>was! He simply pounced on me: "Master dear, is it you? Is it really<br/>you I see?" He took me home with him.<br/><br/>He was no longer in the army, he was married and already had two<br/>little children. He and his wife earned their living as<br/>costermongers in the market-place. His room was poor, but bright<br/>and clean. He made me sit down, set the samovar, sent for his wife,<br/>as though my appearance were a festival for them. He brought me his<br/>children: "Bless them, Father."<br/><br/>"Is it for me to bless them? I am only a humble monk. I will<br/>pray for them. And for you, Afanasy Pavlovitch, I have prayed every<br/>day since that day, for it all came from you," said I. And I<br/>explained that to him as well as I could. And what do you think?<br/>The man kept gazing at me and could not believe that I, his former<br/>master, an officer, was now before him in such a guise and<br/>position; it made him shed tears.<br/><br/>
