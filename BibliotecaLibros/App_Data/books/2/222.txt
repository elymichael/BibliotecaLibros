"Why are you weeping?" said I, "better rejoice over me, dear
friend, whom I can never forget, for my path is a glad and joyful
one."

He did not say much, but kept sighing and shaking his head over
me tenderly.

"What has become of your fortune?" he asked.

"I gave it to the monastery," I answered; "we live in
common."

After tea I began saying good-bye, and suddenly he brought out
half a rouble as an offering to the monastery, and another
half-rouble I saw him thrusting hurriedly into my hand: "That's for
you in your wanderings, it may be of use to you, Father."

I took his half-rouble, bowed to him and his wife, and went out
rejoicing. And on my way I thought: "Here we are both now, he at
home and I on the road, sighing and shaking our heads, no doubt,
and yet smiling joyfully in the gladness of our hearts, remembering
how God brought about our meeting."

I have never seen him again since then. I had been his master
and he my servant, but now when we exchanged a loving kiss with
softened hearts, there was a great human bond between us. I have
thought a great deal about that, and now what I think is this: Is
it so inconceivable that that grand and simple-hearted unity might
in due time become universal among the Russian people? I believe
that it will come to pass and that the time is at hand.

And of servants I will add this: In old days when I was young I
was often angry with servants; "the cook had served something too
hot, the orderly had not brushed my clothes." But what taught me
better then was a thought of my dear brother's, which I had heard
from him in childhood: "Am I worth it, that another should serve me
and be ordered about by me in his poverty and ignorance?" And I
wondered at the time that such simple and self-evident ideas should
be so slow to occur to our minds.

It is impossible that there should be no servants in the world,
but act so that your servant may be freer in spirit than if he were
not a servant. And why cannot I be a servant to my servant and even
let him see it, and that without any pride on my part or any
mistrust on his? Why should not my servant be like my own kindred,
so that I may take him into my family and rejoice in doing so? Even
now this can be done, but it will lead to the grand unity of men in
the future, when a man will not seek servants for himself, or
desire to turn his fellow creatures into servants as he does now,
but on the contrary, will long with his whole heart to be the
servant of all, as the Gospel teaches.

And can it be a dream, that in the end man will find his joy
only in deeds of light and mercy, and not in cruel pleasures as
now, in gluttony, fornication, ostentation, boasting and envious
rivalry of one with the other? I firmly believe that it is not and
that the time is at hand. People laugh and ask: "When will that
time come and does it look like coming?" I believe that with
Christ's help we shall accomplish this great thing. And how many
ideas there have been on earth in the history of man which were
unthinkable ten years before they appeared! Yet when their destined
hour had come, they came forth and spread over the whole earth. So
it will be with us, and our people will shine forth in the world,
and all men will say: "The stone which the builders rejected has
become the cornerstone of the building."

And we may ask the scornful themselves: If our hope is a dream,
when will you build up your edifice and order things justly by your
intellect alone, without Christ? If they declare that it is they
who are advancing towards unity, only the most simple-hearted among
them believe it, so that one may positively marvel at such
simplicity. Of a truth, they have more fantastic dreams than we.
They aim at justice, but, denying Christ, they will end by flooding
the earth with blood, for blood cries out for blood, and he that
taketh up the sword shall perish by the sword. And if it were not
for Christ's covenant, they would slaughter one another down to the
last two men on earth. And those two last men would not be able to
restrain each other in their pride, and the one would slay the
other and then himself. And that would come to pass, were it not
for the promise of Christ that for the sake of the humble and meek
the days shall be shortened.
