"Why, that boy came in riding on that one's back and this one on<br/>that one's."<br/><br/>Kolya was already by Ilusha's bedside. The sick boy turned<br/>visibly paler. He raised himself in the bed and looked intently at<br/>Kolya. Kolya had not seen his little friend for two months, and he<br/>was overwhelmed at the sight of him. He had never imagined that he<br/>would see such a wasted, yellow face, such enormous, feverishly<br/>glowing eyes and such thin little hands. He saw, with grieved<br/>surprise, Ilusha's rapid, hard breathing and dry lips. He stepped<br/>close to him, held out his hand, and almost overwhelmed, he<br/>said:<br/><br/>"Well, old man… how are you?" But his voice failed him, he<br/>couldn't achieve an appearance of ease; his face suddenly twitched<br/>and the corners of his mouth quivered. Ilusha smiled a pitiful<br/>little smile, still unable to utter a word. Something moved Kolya<br/>to raise his hand and pass it over Ilusha's hair.<br/><br/>"Never mind!" he murmured softly to him to cheer him up, or<br/>perhaps not knowing why he said it. For a minute they were silent<br/>again.<br/><br/>"Hallo, so you've got a new puppy?" Kolya said suddenly, in a<br/>most callous voice.<br/><br/>"Ye-es," answered Ilusha in a long whisper, gasping for<br/>breath.<br/><br/>"A black nose, that means he'll be fierce, a good house-dog,"<br/>Kolya observed gravely and stolidly, as if the only thing he cared<br/>about was the puppy and its black nose. But in reality he still had<br/>to do his utmost to control his feelings not to burst out crying<br/>like a child, and do what he would he could not control it. "When<br/>it grows up, you'll have to keep it on the chain, I'm sure."<br/><br/>"He'll be a huge dog!" cried one of the boys.<br/><br/>"Of course he will," "a mastiff," "large," "like this," "as big<br/>as a calf," shouted several voices.<br/><br/>"As big as a calf, as a real calf," chimed in the captain. "I<br/>got one like that on purpose, one of the fiercest breed, and his<br/>parents are huge and very fierce, they stand as high as this from<br/>the floor… . Sit down here, on Ilusha's bed, or here on the bench.<br/>You are welcome, we've been hoping to see you a long time… . You<br/>were so kind as to come with Alexey Fyodorovitch?"<br/><br/>Krassotkin sat on the edge of the bed, at Ilusha's feet. Though<br/>he had perhaps prepared a free-and-easy opening for the<br/>conversation on his way, now he completely lost the thread of<br/>it.<br/>
