"Murder! then he tried to murder you, too?"<br/><br/>"Why, has he killed somebody else?" Madame Hohlakov asked<br/>impulsively.<br/><br/>"If you would kindly listen, madam, for half a moment, I'll<br/>explain it all in a couple of words," answered Perhotin, firmly.<br/>"At five o'clock this afternoon Dmitri Fyodorovitch borrowed ten<br/>roubles from me, and I know for a fact he had no money. Yet at nine<br/>o'clock, he came to see me with a bundle of hundred-rouble notes in<br/>his hand, about two or three thousand roubles. His hands and face<br/>were all covered with blood, and he looked like a madman. When I<br/>asked him where he had got so much money, he answered that he had<br/>just received it from you, that you had given him a sum of three<br/>thousand to go to the gold mines… "<br/><br/>Madame Hohlakov's face assumed an expression of intense and<br/>painful excitement.<br/><br/>"Good God! He must have killed his old father!" she cried,<br/>clasping her hands. "I have never given him money, never! Oh, run,<br/>run!… Don't say another word Save the old man… run to his father…<br/>run!"<br/><br/>"Excuse me, madam, then you did not give him money? You remember<br/>for a fact that you did not give him any money?"<br/><br/>"No, I didn't, I didn't! I refused to give it him, for he could<br/>not appreciate it. He ran out in a fury, stamping. He rushed at me,<br/>but I slipped away… . And let me tell you, as I wish to hide<br/>nothing from you now, that he positively spat at me. Can you fancy<br/>that! But why are we standing? Ah, sit down."<br/><br/>"Excuse me, I… "<br/><br/>"Or better run, run, you must run and save the poor old man from<br/>an awful death!"<br/><br/>"But if he has killed him already?"<br/><br/>"Ah, good heavens, yes! Then what are we to do now? What do you<br/>think we must do now?"<br/>
