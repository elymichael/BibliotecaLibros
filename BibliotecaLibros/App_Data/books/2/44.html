<br/>Dmitri's entrance had taken no more than two minutes, and the<br/>conversation was resumed. But this time Miusov thought it<br/>unnecessary to reply to Father Paissy's persistent and almost<br/>irritable question.<br/><br/>"Allow me to withdraw from this discussion," he observed with a<br/>certain well-bred nonchalance. "It's a subtle question, too. Here<br/>Ivan Fyodorovitch is smiling at us. He must have something<br/>interesting to say about that also. Ask him."<br/><br/>"Nothing special, except one little remark," Ivan replied at<br/>once. "European Liberals in general, and even our liberal<br/>dilettanti, often mix up the final results of socialism with those<br/>of Christianity. This wild notion is, of course, a characteristic<br/>feature. But it's not only Liberals and dilettanti who mix up<br/>socialism and Christianity, but, in many cases, it appears, the<br/>police- the foreign police, of course- do the same. Your Paris<br/>anecdote is rather to the point, Pyotr Alexandrovitch."<br/><br/>"I ask your permission to drop this subject altogether," Miusov<br/>repeated. "I will tell you instead, gentlemen, another interesting<br/>and rather characteristic anecdote of Ivan Fyodorovitch himself.<br/>Only five days ago, in a gathering here, principally of ladies, he<br/>solemnly declared in argument that there was nothing in the whole<br/>world to make men love their neighbours. That there was no law of<br/>nature that man should love mankind, and that, if there had been<br/>any love on earth hitherto, it was not owing to a natural law, but<br/>simply because men have believed in immortality. Ivan Fyodorovitch<br/>added in parenthesis that the whole natural law lies in that faith,<br/>and that if you were to destroy in mankind the belief in<br/>immortality, not only love but every living force maintaining the<br/>life of the world would at once be dried up. Moreover, nothing then<br/>would be immoral, everything would be lawful, even cannibalism.<br/>That's not all. He ended by asserting that for every individual,<br/>like ourselves, who does not believe in God or immortality, the<br/>moral law of nature must immediately be changed into the exact<br/>contrary of the former religious law, and that egoism, even to<br/>crime, must become not only lawful but even recognised as the<br/>inevitable, the most rational, even honourable outcome of his<br/>position. From this paradox, gentlemen, you can judge of the rest<br/>of our eccentric and paradoxical friend Ivan Fyodorovitch's<br/>theories."<br/><br/>"Excuse me," Dmitri cried suddenly; "if I've heard aright, crime<br/>must not only be permitted but even recognised as the inevitable<br/>and the most rational outcome of his position for every infidel! Is<br/>that so or not?"<br/><br/>"Quite so," said Father Paissy.<br/><br/>"I'll remember it."<br/><br/>Having uttered these words Dmitri ceased speaking as suddenly as<br/>he had begun. Everyone looked at him with curiosity.<br/><br/>"Is that really your conviction as to the consequences of the<br/>disappearance of the faith in immortality?" the elder asked Ivan<br/>suddenly.<br/><br/>"Yes. That was my contention. There is no virtue if there is no<br/>immortality."<br/><br/>
