<br/>"All right, all right… "<br/><br/>Mitya's head was burning. He went outside to the wooden balcony<br/>which ran round the whole building on the inner side, overlooking<br/>the courtyard. The fresh air revived him. He stood alone in a dark<br/>corner, and suddenly clutched his head in both hands. His scattered<br/>thoughts came together; his sensations blended into a whole and<br/>threw a sudden light into his mind. A fearful and terrible light!<br/>"If I'm to shoot myself, why not now?" passed through his mind.<br/>"Why not go for the pistols, bring them here, and here, in this<br/>dark dirty corner, make an end?" Almost a minute he undecided. A<br/>few hours earlier, when he had been dashing here, he was pursued by<br/>disgrace, by the theft he had committed, and that blood, that<br/>blood!… But yet it was easier for him then. Then everything was<br/>over: he had lost her, given her up. She was gone, for him- oh,<br/>then his death sentence had been easier for him; at least it had<br/>seemed necessary, inevitable, for what had he to stay on earth<br/>for?<br/><br/>But now? Was it the same as then? Now one phantom, one terror at<br/>least was at an end: that first, rightful lover, that fateful<br/>figure had vanished, leaving no trace. The terrible phantom had<br/>turned into something so small, so comic; it had been carried into<br/>the bedroom and locked in. It would never return. She was ashamed,<br/>and from her eyes he could see now whom she loved. Now he had<br/>everything to make life happy… but he could not go on living, he<br/>could not; oh, damnation! "O God! restore to life the man I knocked<br/>down at the fence! Let this fearful cup pass from me! Lord, thou<br/>hast wrought miracles for such sinners as me! But what, what if the<br/>old man's alive? Oh, then the shame of the other disgrace I would<br/>wipe away. I would restore the stolen money. I'd give it back; I'd<br/>get it somehow… . No trace of that shame will remain except in my<br/>heart for ever! But no, no; oh, impossible cowardly dreams! Oh,<br/>damnation!"<br/><br/>Yet there was a ray of light and hope in his darkness. He jumped<br/>up and ran back to the room- to her, to her, his queen for ever!<br/>Was not one moment of her love worth all the rest of life, even in<br/>the agonies of disgrace? This wild question clutched at his heart.<br/>"To her, to her alone, to see her, to hear her, to think of<br/>nothing, to forget everything, if only for that night, for an hour,<br/>for a moment!" Just as he turned from the balcony into the passage,<br/>he came upon the landlord, Trifon Borissovitch. He thought he<br/>looked gloomy and worried, and fancied he had come to find him.<br/><br/>"What is it, Trifon Borissovitch? Are you looking for me?"<br/><br/>"No, sir," The landlord seemed disconcerted. "Why should I be<br/>looking for you? Where have you been?"<br/><br/>"Why do you look so glum? You're not angry, are you? Wait a bit,<br/>you shall soon get to bed… . What's the time?"<br/><br/>"It'll be three o'clock. Past three, it must be."<br/><br/>"We'll leave off soon. We'll leave off."<br/><br/>"Don't mention it; it doesn't matter. Keep it up as long as you<br/>like… "<br/><br/>
