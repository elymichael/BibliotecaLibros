She drew out of her bosom her boy's little embroidered sash, and<br/>as soon as she looked at it she began shaking with sobs, hiding her<br/>eyes with her fingers through which the tears flowed in a sudden<br/>stream.<br/><br/>"It is Rachel of old," said the elder, "weeping for her<br/>children, and will not be comforted because they are not. Such is<br/>the lot set on earth for you mothers. Be not comforted. Consolation<br/>is not what you need. Weep and be not consoled, but weep. Only<br/>every time that you weep be sure to remember that your little son<br/>is one of the angels of God, that he looks down from there at you<br/>and sees you, and rejoices at your tears, and points at them to the<br/>Lord God; and a long while yet will you keep that great mother's<br/>grief. But it will turn in the end into quiet joy, and your bitter<br/>tears will be only tears of tender sorrow that purifies the heart<br/>and delivers it from sin. And I shall pray for the peace of your<br/>child's soul. What was his name?"<br/><br/>"Alexey, Father."<br/><br/>"A sweet name. After Alexey, the man of God?"<br/><br/>"Yes, Father."<br/><br/>"What a saint he was! I will remember him, mother, and your<br/>grief in my prayers, and I will pray for your husband's health. It<br/>is a sin for you to leave him. Your little one will see from heaven<br/>that you have forsaken his father, and will weep over you. Why do<br/>you trouble his happiness? He is living, for the soul lives for<br/>ever, and though he is not in the house he is near you, unseen. How<br/>can he go into the house when you say that the house is hateful to<br/>you? To whom is he to go if he find you not together, his father<br/>and mother? He comes to you in dreams now, and you grieve. But then<br/>he will send you gentle dreams. Go to your husband, mother; go this<br/>very day."<br/><br/>"I will go, Father, at your word. I will go. You've gone<br/>straight to my heart. My Nikita, my Nikita, you are waiting for<br/>me," the woman began in a sing-song voice; but the elder had<br/>already turned away to a very old woman, dressed like a dweller in<br/>the town, not like a pilgrim. Her eyes showed that she had come<br/>with an object, and in order to say something. She said she was the<br/>widow of a non-commissioned officer, and lived close by in the<br/>town. Her son Vasenka was in the commissariat service, and had gone<br/>to Irkutsk in Siberia. He had written twice from there, but now a<br/>year had passed since he had written. She did inquire about him,<br/>but she did not know the proper place to inquire.<br/><br/>"Only the other day Stepanida Ilyinishna- she's a rich<br/>merchant's wife- said to me, 'You go, Prohorovna, and put your<br/>son's name down for prayer in the church, and pray for the peace of<br/>his soul as though he were dead. His soul will be troubled,' she<br/>said, 'and he will write you a letter.' And Stepanida Ilyinishna<br/>told me it was a certain thing which had been many times tried.<br/>Only I am in doubtâ€¦ . Oh, you light of ours! is it true or false,<br/>and would it be right?"<br/><br/>"Don't think of it. It's shameful to ask the question. How is it<br/>possible to pray for the peace of a living soul? And his own mother<br/>too! It's a great sin, akin to sorcery. Only for your ignorance it<br/>is forgiven you. Better pray to the Queen of Heaven, our swift<br/>defence and help, for his good health, and that she may forgive you<br/>for your error. And another thing I will tell you, Prohorovna.<br/>Either he will soon come back to you, your son, or he will be sure<br/>to send a letter. Go, and henceforward be in peace. Your son is<br/>alive, I tell you."<br/><br/>"Dear Father, God reward you, our benefactor, who prays for all<br/>of us and for our sins!"<br/><br/>But the elder had already noticed in the crowd two glowing eyes<br/>fixed upon him. An exhausted, consumptive-looking, though young<br/>peasant woman was gazing at him in silence. Her eyes besought him,<br/>but she seemed afraid to approach.<br/>
