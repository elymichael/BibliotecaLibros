"Couldn't you, without abandoning your resolution to be silent
about the chief point, could you not, at the same time, give us
some slight hint as to the nature of the motives which are strong
enough to induce you to refuse to answer, at a crisis so full of
danger to you?"

Mitya smiled mournfully, almost dreamily.

"I'm much more good-natured than you think, gentlemen. I'll tell
you the reason why and give you that hint, though you don't deserve
it. I won't speak of that, gentlemen, because it would be a stain
on my honour. The answer to the question where I got the money
would expose me to far greater disgrace than the murder and robbing
of my father, if I had murdered and robbed him. That's why I can't
tell you. I can't for fear of disgrace. What, gentlemen, are you
going to write that down?"

"Yes, we'll write it down," lisped Nikolay Parfenovitch.

"You ought not to write that down about 'disgrace.' I only told
you that in the goodness of my heart. I needn't have told you. I
made you a present of it, so to speak, and you pounce upon it at
once. Oh, well, write- write what you like," he concluded, with
scornful disgust. "I'm not afraid of you and I can still hold up my
head before you."

"And can't you tell us the nature of that disgrace?" Nikolay
Parfenovitch hazarded.

The prosecutor frowned darkly.

"No, no, c'est fini, don't trouble yourselves. It's not worth
while soiling one's hands. I have soiled myself enough through you
as it is. You're not worth it- no one is. Enough, gentlemen. I'm
not going on."

This was said too peremptorily. Nikolay Parfenovitch did not
insist further, but from Ippolit Kirillovitch's eyes he saw that he
had not given up hope.

"Can you not, at least, tell us what sum you had in your hands
when you went into Mr. Perhotin's- how many roubles exactly?"

"I can't tell you that."
