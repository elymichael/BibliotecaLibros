<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>9<br/>The Devil. Ivan's Nightmare<br/><br/><br/>I AM NOT a doctor, but yet I feel that the moment has come when<br/>I must inevitably give the reader some account of the nature of<br/>Ivan's illness. Anticipating events I can say at least one thing:<br/>he was at that moment on the very eve of an attack of brain fever.<br/>Though his health had long been affected, it had offered a stubborn<br/>resistance to the fever which in the end gained complete mastery<br/>over it. Though I know nothing of medicine, I venture to hazard the<br/>suggestion that he really had perhaps, by a terrible effort of<br/>will, succeeded in delaying the attack for a time, hoping, of<br/>course, to check it completely. He knew that he was unwell, but he<br/>loathed the thought of being ill at that fatal time, at the<br/>approaching crisis in his life, when he needed to have all his wits<br/>about him, to say what he had to say boldly and resolutely and "to<br/>justify himself to himself."<br/><br/>He had, however, consulted the new doctor, who had been brought<br/>from Moscow by a fantastic notion of Katerina Ivanovna's to which I<br/>have referred already. After listening to him and examining him the<br/>doctor came to the conclusion that he was actually suffering from<br/>some disorder of the brain, and was not at all surprised by an<br/>admission which Ivan had reluctantly made him. "Hallucinations are<br/>quite likely in your condition," the doctor opined, 'though it<br/>would be better to verify them… you must take steps at once,<br/>without a moment's delay, or things will go badly with you." But<br/>Ivan did not follow this judicious advice and did not take to his<br/>bed to be nursed. "I am walking about, so I am strong enough, if I<br/>drop, it'll be different then, anyone may nurse me who likes," he<br/>decided, dismissing the subject.<br/><br/>And so he was sitting almost conscious himself of his delirium<br/>and, as I have said already, looking persistently at some object on<br/>the sofa against the opposite wall. Someone appeared to be sitting<br/>there, though goodness knows how he had come in, for he had not<br/>been in the room when Ivan came into it, on his return from<br/>Smerdyakov. This was a person or, more accurately speaking, a<br/>Russian gentleman of a particular kind, no longer young, qui<br/>faisait la cinquantaine,<br/>[15]<br/>as the<br/>French say, with rather long, still thick, dark hair, slightly<br/>streaked with grey and a small pointed beard. He was wearing a<br/>brownish reefer jacket, rather shabby, evidently made by a good<br/>tailor though, and of a fashion at least three years old, that had<br/>been discarded by smart and well-to-do people for the last two<br/>years. His linen and his long scarf-like neck-tie were all such as<br/>are worn by people who aim at being stylish, but on closer<br/>inspection his linen was not overclean and his wide scarf was very<br/>threadbare. The visitor's check trousers were of excellent cut, but<br/>were too light in colour and too tight for the present fashion. His<br/>soft fluffy white hat was out of keeping with the season. In brief<br/>there was every appearance of gentility on straitened means. It<br/>looked as though the gentleman belonged to that class of idle<br/>landowners who used to flourish in the times of serfdom. He had<br/>unmistakably been, at some time, in good and fashionable society,<br/>had once had good connections, had possibly preserved them indeed,<br/>but, after a gay youth, becoming gradually impoverished on the<br/>abolition of serfdom, he had sunk into the position of a poor<br/>relation of the best class, wandering from one good old friend to<br/>another and received by them for his companionable and<br/>accommodating disposition and as being, after all, a gentleman who<br/>could be asked to sit down with anyone, though, of course, not in a<br/>place of honour. Such gentlemen of accommodating temper and<br/>dependent position, who can tell a story, take a hand at cards, and<br/>who have a distinct aversion for any duties that may be forced upon<br/>them, are usually solitary creatures, either bachelors or widowers.<br/>Sometimes they have children, but if so, the children are always<br/>being brought up at a distance, at some aunt's, to whom these<br/>gentlemen never allude in good society, seeming ashamed of the<br/>relationship. They gradually lose sight of their children<br/>altogether, though at intervals they receive a birthday or<br/>Christmas letter from them and sometimes even answer it. The<br/>countenance of the unexpected visitor was not so much good-natured,<br/>as accommodating and ready to assume any amiable expression as<br/>occasion might arise. He had no watch, but he had a tortoise-shell<br/>lorgnette on a black ribbon. On the middle finger of his right hand<br/>was a massive gold ring with a cheap opal stone in it. Ivan was<br/>angrily silent and would not begin the conversation. The visitor<br/>waited and sat exactly like a poor relation who had come down from<br/>his room to keep his host company at tea, and was discreetly<br/>silent, seeing that his host was frowning and preoccupied. But he<br/>was ready for any affable conversation as soon as his host should<br/>begin it. All at once his face expressed a sudden solicitude. "I<br/>say," he began to Ivan, "excuse me, I only mention it to remind<br/>you. You went to Smerdyakov's to find out about Katerina Ivanovna,<br/>but you came away without finding out anything about her, you<br/>probably forgot-" "Ah, yes." broke from Ivan and his face grew<br/>gloomy with uneasiness. "Yes, I'd forgotten… but it doesn't matter<br/>now, never mind, till to-morrow," he muttered to himself, "and<br/>you," he added, addressing his visitor, "I should have remembered<br/>that myself in a minute, for that was just what was tormenting me!<br/>Why do you interfere, as if I should believe that you prompted me,<br/>and that I didn't remember it of myself?" "Don't believe it then,"<br/>said the gentleman, smiling amicably, "what's the good of believing<br/>against your will? Besides, proofs are no help to believing,<br/>especially material proofs. Thomas believed, not because he saw<br/>Christ risen, but because he wanted to believe, before he saw. Look<br/>at the spiritualists, for instance… . I am very fond of them… only<br/>fancy, they imagine that they are serving the cause of religion,<br/>because the devils show them their horns from the other world.<br/>That, they say, is a material proof, so to speak, of the existence<br/>of another world. The other world and material proofs, what next!<br/>And if you come to that, does proving there's a devil prove that<br/>there's a God? I want to join an idealist society, I'll lead the<br/>opposition in it, I'll say I am a realist, but not a materialist,<br/>he he!" "Listen," Ivan suddenly got up from the table. "I seem to<br/>be delirious… I am delirious, in fact, talk any nonsense you like,<br/>I don't care! You won't drive me to fury, as you did last time. But<br/>I feel somehow ashamed… I want to walk about the room… . I<br/>sometimes don't see you and don't even hear your voice as I did<br/>last time, but I always guess what you are prating, for it's I, I<br/>myself speaking, not you. Only I don't know whether I was dreaming<br/>last time or whether I really saw you. I'll wet a towel and put it<br/>on my head and perhaps you'll vanish into air." Ivan went into the<br/>corner, took a towel, and did as he said, and with a wet towel on<br/>his head began walking up and down the room. "I am so glad you<br/>treat me so familiarly," the visitor began. "Fool," laughed Ivan,<br/>"do you suppose I should stand on ceremony with you? I am in good<br/>spirits now, though I've a pain in my forehead… and in the top of<br/>my head… only please don't talk philosophy, as you did last time.<br/>If you can't take yourself off, talk of something amusing. Talk<br/>gossip, you are a poor relation, you ought to talk gossip. What a<br/>nightmare to have! But I am not afraid of you. I'll get the better<br/>of you. I won't be taken to a mad-house!" "C'est charmant, poor<br/>relation. Yes, I am in my natural shape. For what am I on earth but<br/>a poor relation? By the way, I am listening to you and am rather<br/>surprised to find you are actually beginning to take me for<br/>something real, not simply your fancy, as you persisted in<br/>declaring last time-" "Never for one minute have I taken you for<br/>reality," Ivan cried with a sort of fury. "You are a lie, you are<br/>my illness, you are a phantom. It's only that I don't know how to<br/>destroy you and I see I must suffer for a time. You are my<br/>hallucination. You are the incarnation of myself, but only of one<br/>side of me… of my thoughts and feelings, but only the nastiest and<br/>stupidest of them. From that point of view you might be of interest<br/>to me, if only I had time to waste on you-" "Excuse me, excuse me,<br/>I'll catch you. When you flew out at Alyosha under the lamp-post<br/>this evening and shouted to him, 'You learnt it from him! How do<br/>you know that he visits me?' You were thinking of me then. So for<br/>one brief moment you did believe that I really exist," the<br/>gentleman laughed blandly. "Yes, that was a moment of weakness… but<br/>I couldn't believe in you. I don't know whether I was asleep or<br/>awake last time. Perhaps I was only dreaming then and didn't see<br/>you really at all-" "And why were you so surly with Alyosha just<br/>now? He is a dear; I've treated him badly over Father Zossima."<br/>"Don't talk of Alyosha! How dare you, you flunkey!" Ivan laughed<br/>again. "You scold me, but you laugh- that's a good sign. But you<br/>are ever so much more polite than you were last time and I know<br/>why: that great resolution of yours-" "Don't speak of my<br/>resolution," cried Ivan, savagely. "I understand, I understand,<br/>c'est noble, c'est charmant, you are going to defend your brother<br/>and to sacrifice yourself… C'est chevaleresque." "Hold your tongue,<br/>I'll kick you!" "I shan't be altogether sorry, for then my object<br/>will be attained. If you kick me, you must believe in my reality,<br/>for people don't kick ghosts. Joking apart, it doesn't matter to<br/>me, scold if you like, though it's better to be a trifle more<br/>polite even to me. 'Fool, flunkey!' what words!" "Scolding you, I<br/>scold myself," Ivan laughed again, "you are myself, myself, only<br/>with a different face. You just say what I am thinking… and are<br/>incapable of saying anything new!" "If I am like you in my way of<br/>thinking, it's all to my credit," the gentleman declared, with<br/>delicacy and dignity. "You choose out only my worst thoughts, and<br/>what's more, the stupid ones. You are stupid and vulgar. You are<br/>awfully stupid. No, I can't put up with you! What am I to do, what<br/>am I to do?" Ivan said through his clenched teeth. "My dear friend,<br/>above all things I want to behave like a gentleman and to be<br/>recognised as such," the visitor began in an access of deprecating<br/>and simple-hearted pride, typical of a poor relation. "I am poor,<br/>but… I won't say very honest, but… it's an axiom generally accepted<br/>in society that I am a fallen angel. I certainly can't conceive how<br/>I can ever have been an angel. If I ever was, it must have been so<br/>long ago that there's no harm in forgetting it. Now I only prize<br/>the reputation of being a gentlemanly person and live as I can,<br/>trying to make myself agreeable. I love men genuinely, I've been<br/>greatly calumniated! Here when I stay with you from time to time,<br/>my life gains a kind of reality and that's what I like most of all.<br/>You see, like you, I suffer from the fantastic and so I love the<br/>realism of earth. Here, with you, everything is circumscribed, here<br/>all is formulated and geometrical, while we have nothing but<br/>indeterminate equations! I wander about here dreaming. I like<br/>dreaming. Besides, on earth I become superstitious. Please don't<br/>laugh, that's just what I like, to become superstitious. I adopt<br/>all your habits here: I've grown fond of going to the public baths,<br/>would you believe it? and I go and steam myself with merchants and<br/>priests. What I dream of is becoming incarnate once for all and<br/>irrevocably in the form of some merchant's wife weighing eighteen<br/>stone, and of believing all she believes. My ideal is to go to<br/>church and offer a candle in simple-hearted faith, upon my word it<br/>is. Then there would be an end to my sufferings. I like being<br/>doctored too; in the spring there was an outbreak of smallpox and I<br/>went and was vaccinated in a foundling hospital- if only you knew<br/>how I enjoyed myself that day. I subscribed ten roubles in the<br/>cause of the Slavs!… But you are not listening. Do you know, you<br/>are not at all well this evening? I know you went yesterday to that<br/>doctor… well, what about your health? What did the doctor say?"<br/>"Fool!" Ivan snapped out. "But you are clever, anyway. You are<br/>scolding again? I didn't ask out of sympathy. You needn't answer.<br/>Now rheumatism has come in again-" "Fool!" repeated Ivan. "You keep<br/>saying the same thing; but I had such an attack of rheumatism last<br/>year that I remember it to this day." "The devil have rheumatism!"<br/>"Why not, if I sometimes put on fleshly form? I put on fleshly form<br/>and I take the consequences. Satan sum et nihil humanum a me<br/>alienum puto."<br/>[16]<br/>"What, what, Satan sum et nihil<br/>humanum… that's not bad for the devil!" "I am glad I've pleased you<br/>at last." "But you didn't get that from me." Ivan stopped suddenly,<br/>seeming struck. "That never entered my head, that's strange."<br/>"C'est du nouveau, n'est-ce pas?"<br/>[17]<br/>This<br/>time I'll act honestly and explain to you. Listen, in dreams and<br/>especially in nightmares, from indigestion or anything, a man sees<br/>sometimes such artistic visions, such complex and real actuality,<br/>such events, even a whole world of events, woven into such a plot,<br/>with such unexpected details from the most exalted matters to the<br/>last button on a cuff, as I swear Leo Tolstoy has never invented.<br/>Yet such dreams are sometimes seen not by writers, but by the most<br/>ordinary people, officials, journalists, priests… . The subject is<br/>a complete enigma. A statesman confessed to me, indeed, that all<br/>his best ideas came to him when he was asleep. Well, that's how it<br/>is now, though I am your hallucination, yet just as in a nightmare,<br/>I say original things which had not entered your head before. So I<br/>don't repeat your ideas, yet I am only your nightmare, nothing<br/>more." "You are lying, your aim is to convince me you exist apart<br/>and are not my nightmare, and now you are asserting you are a<br/>dream." "My dear fellow, I've adopted a special method to-day, I'll<br/>explain it to you afterwards. Stay, where did I break off? Oh, yes!<br/>I caught cold then, only not here but yonder." "Where is yonder?<br/>Tell me, will you be here long. Can't you go away?" Ivan exclaimed<br/>almost in despair. He ceased walking to and fro, sat down on the<br/>sofa, leaned his elbows on the table again and held his head tight<br/>in both hands. He pulled the wet towel off and flung it away in<br/>vexation. It was evidently of no use. "Your nerves are out of<br/>order," observed the gentleman, with a carelessly easy, though<br/>perfectly polite, air. "You are angry with me even for being able<br/>to catch cold, though it happened in a most natural way. I was<br/>hurrying then to a diplomatic soiree at the house of a lady of high<br/>rank in Petersburg, who was aiming at influence in the Ministry.<br/>Well, an evening suit, white tie, gloves, though I was God knows<br/>where and had to fly through space to reach your earth… . Of<br/>course, it took only an instant, but you know a ray of light from<br/>the sun takes full eight minutes, and fancy in an evening suit and<br/>open waistcoat. Spirits don't freeze, but when one's in fleshly<br/>form, well… in brief, I didn't think, and set off, and you know in<br/>those ethereal spaces, in the water that is above the firmament,<br/>there's such a frost… at least one can't call it frost, you fancy,<br/>150 degrees below zero! You know the game the village girls play-<br/>they invite the unwary to lick an axe in thirty degrees of frost,<br/>the tongue instantly freezes to it and the dupe tears the skin off,<br/>so it bleeds. But that's only in 30 degrees, in 150 degrees I<br/>imagine it would be enough to put your finger on the axe and it<br/>would be the end of it… if only there could be an axe there." "And<br/>can there be an axe there?" Ivan interrupted, carelessly and<br/>disdainfully. He was exerting himself to the utmost not to believe<br/>in the delusion and not to sink into complete insanity "An axe?"<br/>the guest interrupted in surprise. "Yes, what would become of an<br/>axe there?" Ivan cried suddenly, with a sort of savage and<br/>insistent obstinacy. "What would become of an axe in space? Quelle<br/>idee! If it were to fall to any distance, it would begin, I think,<br/>flying round the earth without knowing why, like a satellite. The<br/>astronomers would calculate the rising and the setting of the axe;<br/>Gatzuk would put it in his calendar, that's all." "You are stupid,<br/>awfully stupid," said Ivan peevishly. "Fib more cleverly or I won't<br/>listen. You want to get the better of me by realism, to convince me<br/>that you exist, but I don't want to believe you exist! I won't<br/>believe it!" "But I am not fibbing, it's all the truth; the truth<br/>is unhappily hardly ever amusing. I see you persist in expecting<br/>something big of me, and perhaps something fine. That's a great<br/>pity, for I only give what I can-" "Don't talk philosophy, you<br/>ass!" "Philosophy, indeed, when all my right side is numb and I am<br/>moaning and groaning. I've tried all the medical faculty: they can<br/>diagnose beautifully, they have the whole of your disease at their<br/>finger-tips, but they've no idea how to cure you. There was an<br/>enthusiastic little student here, 'You may die,' said he, 'but<br/>you'll know perfectly what disease you are dying of!' And then what<br/>a way they have of sending people to specialists! 'We only<br/>diagnose,' they say, 'but go to such-and-such a specialist, he'll<br/>cure you.' The old doctor who used to cure all sorts of disease has<br/>completely disappeared, I assure you, now there are only<br/>specialists and they all advertise in the newspapers. If anything<br/>is wrong with your nose, they send you to Paris: there, they say,<br/>is a European specialist who cures noses. If you go to Paris, he'll<br/>look at your nose; I can only cure your right nostril, he'll tell<br/>you, for I don't cure the left nostril, that's not my speciality,<br/>but go to Vienna, there there's a specialist who will cure your<br/>left nostril. What are you to do? I fell back on popular remedies,<br/>a German doctor advised me to rub myself with honey and salt in the<br/>bath-house. Solely to get an extra bath I went, smeared myself all<br/>over and it did me no good at all. In despair I wrote to Count<br/>Mattei in Milan. He sent me a book and some drops, bless him, and,<br/>only fancy, Hoff's malt extract cured me! I bought it by accident,<br/>drank a bottle and a half of it, and I was ready to dance, it took<br/>it away completely. I made up my mind to write to the papers to<br/>thank him, I was prompted by a feeling of gratitude, and only<br/>fancy, it led to no end of a bother: not a single paper would take<br/>my letter. 'It would be very reactionary,' they said, 'none will<br/>believe it. Le diable n'existe point.* You'd better remain<br/>anonymous,' they advised me. What use is a letter of thanks if it's<br/>anonymous? I laughed with the men at the newspaper office; 'It's<br/>reactionary to believe in God in our days,' I said, 'but I am the<br/>devil, so I may be believed in.' 'We quite understand that,' they<br/>said. 'Who doesn't believe in the devil? Yet it won't do, it might<br/>injure our reputation. As a joke, if you like.' But I thought as a<br/>joke it wouldn't be very witty. So it wasn't printed. And do you<br/>know, I have felt sore about it to this day. My best feelings,<br/>gratitude, for instance, are literally denied me simply from my<br/>social position." The devil does not exist. "Philosophical<br/>reflections again?" Ivan snarled malignantly. "God preserve me from<br/>it, but one can't help complaining sometimes. I am a slandered man.<br/>You upbraid me every moment with being stupid. One can see you are<br/>young. My dear fellow, intelligence isn't the only thing! I have<br/>naturally a kind and merry heart. 'I also write vaudevilles of all<br/>sorts.' You seem to take me for Hlestakov grown old, but my fate is<br/>a far more serious one. Before time was, by some decree which I<br/>could never make out, I was predestined 'to deny' and yet I am<br/>genuinely good-hearted and not at all inclined to negation. 'No,<br/>you must go and deny, without denial there's no criticism and what<br/>would a journal be without a column of criticism?' Without<br/>criticism it would be nothing but one 'hosannah.' But nothing but<br/>hosannah is not enough for life, the hosannah must be tried in the<br/>crucible of doubt and so on, in the same style. But I don't meddle<br/>in that, I didn't create it, I am not answerable for it. Well,<br/>they've chosen their scapegoat, they've made me write the column of<br/>criticism and so life was made possible. We understand that comedy;<br/>I, for instance, simply ask for annihilation. No, live, I am told,<br/>for there'd be nothing without you. If everything in the universe<br/>were sensible, nothing would happen. There would be no events<br/>without you, and there must be events. So against the grain I serve<br/>to produce events and do what's irrational because I am commanded<br/>to. For all their indisputable intelligence, men take this farce as<br/>something serious, and that is their tragedy. They suffer, of<br/>course… but then they live, they live a real life, not a fantastic<br/>one, for suffering is life. Without suffering what would be the<br/>pleasure of it? It would be transformed into an endless church<br/>service; it would be holy, but tedious. But what about me? I<br/>suffer, but still, I don't live. I am x in an indeterminate<br/>equation. I am a sort of phantom in life who has lost all beginning<br/>and end, and who has even forgotten his own name. You are laughing-<br/>no, you are not laughing, you are angry again. You are for ever<br/>angry, all you care about is intelligence, but I repeat again that<br/>I would give away all this superstellar life, all the ranks and<br/>honours, simply to be transformed into the soul of a merchant's<br/>wife weighing eighteen stone and set candles at God's shrine."<br/>"Then even you don't believe in God?" said Ivan, with a smile of<br/>hatred. "What can I say?- that is, if you are in earnest-" "Is<br/>there a God or not?" Ivan cried with the same savage intensity.<br/>"Ah, then you are in earnest! My dear fellow, upon my word I don't<br/>know. There! I've said it now!" "You don't know, but you see God?<br/>No, you are not someone apart, you are myself, you are I and<br/>nothing more! You are rubbish, you are my fancy!" "Well, if you<br/>like, I have the same philosophy as you, that would be true. Je<br/>pense, donc je suis,* I know that for a fact; all the rest, all<br/>these worlds, God and even Satan- all that is not proved, to my<br/>mind. Does all that exist of itself, or is it only an emanation of<br/>myself, a logical development of my ego which alone has existed for<br/>ever: but I make haste to stop, for I believe you will be jumping<br/>up to beat me directly." I think, therefore I am. "You'd better<br/>tell me some anecdote!" said Ivan miserably. "There is an anecdote<br/>precisely on our subject, or rather a legend, not an anecdote. You<br/>reproach me with unbelief; you see, you say, yet you don't believe.<br/>But, my dear fellow, I am not the only one like that. We are all in<br/>a muddle over there now and all through your science. Once there<br/>used to be atoms, five senses, four elements, and then everything<br/>hung together somehow. There were atoms in the ancient world even,<br/>but since we've learned that you've discovered the chemical<br/>molecule and protoplasm and the devil knows what, we had to lower<br/>our crest. There's a regular muddle, and, above all, superstition,<br/>scandal; there's as much scandal among us as among you, you know; a<br/>little more in fact, and spying, indeed, for we have our secret<br/>police department where private information is received. Well, this<br/>wild legend belongs to our middle ages- not yours, but ours- and no<br/>one believes it even among us, except the old ladies of eighteen<br/>stone, not your old ladies I mean, but ours. We've everything you<br/>have, I am revealing one of our secrets out of friendship for you;<br/>though it's forbidden. This legend is about Paradise. There was,<br/>they say, here on earth a thinker and philosopher. He rejected<br/>everything, 'laws, conscience, faith,' and, above all, the future<br/>life. He died; he expected to go straight to darkness and death and<br/>he found a future life before him. He was astounded and indignant.<br/>'This is against my principles!' he said. And he was punished for<br/>that… that is, you must excuse me, I am just repeating what I heard<br/>myself, it's only a legend… he was sentenced to walk a quadrillion<br/>kilometres in the dark (we've adopted the metric system, you know):<br/>and when he has finished that quadrillion, the gates of heaven<br/>would be opened to him and he'll be forgiven-" "And what tortures<br/>have you in the other world besides the quadrillion kilometres?"<br/>asked Ivan, with a strange eagerness. "What tortures? Ah, don't<br/>ask. In old days we had all sorts, but now they have taken chiefly<br/>to moral punishments- 'the stings of conscience' and all that<br/>nonsense. We got that, too, from you, from the softening of your<br/>manners. And who's the better for it? Only those who have got no<br/>conscience, for how can they be tortured by conscience when they<br/>have none? But decent people who have conscience and a sense of<br/>honour suffer for it. Reforms, when the ground has not been<br/>prepared for them, especially if they are institutions copied from<br/>abroad, do nothing but mischief! The ancient fire was better. Well,<br/>this man, who was condemned to the quadrillion kilometres, stood<br/>still, looked round and lay down across the road. 'I won't go, I<br/>refuse on principle!' Take the soul of an enlightened Russian<br/>atheist and mix it with the soul of the prophet Jonah, who sulked<br/>for three days and nights in the belly of the whale, and you get<br/>the character of that thinker who lay across the road." "What did<br/>he lie on there?" "Well, I suppose there was something to lie on.<br/>You are not laughing?" "Bravo!" cried Ivan, still with the same<br/>strange eagerness. Now he was listening with an unexpected<br/>curiosity. "Well, is he lying there now?" "That's the point, that<br/>he isn't. He lay there almost a thousand years and then he got up<br/>and went on." "What an ass!" cried Ivan, laughing nervously and<br/>still seeming to be pondering something intently. "Does it make any<br/>difference whether he lies there for ever or walks the quadrillion<br/>kilometres? It would take a billion years to walk it?" "Much more<br/>than that. I haven't got a pencil and paper or I could work it out.<br/>But he got there long ago, and that's where the story begins."<br/>"What, he got there? But how did he get the billion years to do<br/>it?" "Why, you keep thinking of our present earth! But our present<br/>earth may have been repeated a billion times. Why, it's become<br/>extinct, been frozen; cracked, broken to bits, disintegrated into<br/>its elements, again 'the water above the firmament,' then again a<br/>comet, again a sun, again from the sun it becomes earth- and the<br/>same sequence may have been repeated endlessly and exactly the same<br/>to every detail, most unseemly and insufferably tedious-" "Well,<br/>well, what happened when he arrived?" "Why, the moment the gates of<br/>Paradise were open and he walked in; before he had been there two<br/>seconds, by his watch (though to my thinking his watch must have<br/>long dissolved into its elements on the way), he cried out that<br/>those two seconds were worth walking not a quadrillion kilometres<br/>but a quadrillion of quadrillions, raised to the quadrillionth<br/>power! In fact, he sang 'hosannah' and overdid it so, that some<br/>persons there of lofty ideas wouldn't shake hands with him at<br/>first- he'd become too rapidly reactionary, they said. The Russian<br/>temperament. I repeat, it's a legend. I give it for what it's<br/>worth, so that's the sort of ideas we have on such subjects even<br/>now." "I've caught you!" Ivan cried, with an almost childish<br/>delight, as though he had succeeded in remembering something at<br/>last. "That anecdote about the quadrillion years, I made up myself!<br/>I was seventeen then, I was at the high school. I made up that<br/>anecdote and told it to a schoolfellow called Korovkin, it was at<br/>Moscow… . The anecdote is so characteristic that I couldn't have<br/>taken it from anywhere. I thought I'd forgotten it… but I've<br/>unconsciously recalled it- I recalled it myself- it was not you<br/>telling it! Thousands of things are unconsciously remembered like<br/>that even when people are being taken to execution… it's come back<br/>to me in a dream. You are that dream! You are a dream, not a living<br/>creature!" "From the vehemence with which you deny my existence,"<br/>laughed the gentleman, "I am convinced that you believe in me."<br/>"Not in the slightest! I haven't a hundredth part of a grain of<br/>faith in you!" "But you have the thousandth of a grain. Homeopathic<br/>doses perhaps are the strongest. Confess that you have faith even<br/>to the ten-thousandth of a grain." "Not for one minute," cried Ivan<br/>furiously. "But I should like to believe in you," he added<br/>strangely. "Aha! There's an admission! But I am good-natured. I'll<br/>come to your assistance again. Listen, it was I caught you, not you<br/>me. I told you your anecdote you'd forgotten, on purpose, so as to<br/>destroy your faith in me completely." "You are lying. The object of<br/>your visit is to convince me of your existence!" "Just so. But<br/>hesitation, suspense, conflict between belief and disbelief- is<br/>sometimes such torture to a conscientious man, such as you are,<br/>that it's better to hang oneself at once. Knowing that you are<br/>inclined to believe in me, I administered some disbelief by telling<br/>you that anecdote. I lead you to belief and disbelief by turns, and<br/>I have my motive in it. It's the new method. As soon as you<br/>disbelieve in me completely, you'll begin assuring me to my face<br/>that I am not a dream but a reality. I know you. Then I shall have<br/>attained my object, which is an honourable one. I shall sow in you<br/>only a tiny grain of faith and it will grow into an oak-tree- and<br/>such an oak-tree that, sitting on it, you will long to enter the<br/>ranks of 'the hermits in the wilderness and the saintly women,' for<br/>that is what you are secretly longing for. You'll dine on locusts,<br/>you'll wander into the wilderness to save your soul!" "Then it's<br/>for the salvation of my soul you are working, is it, you<br/>scoundrel?" "One must do a good work sometimes. How ill-humoured<br/>you are!" "Fool! did you ever tempt those holy men who ate locusts<br/>and prayed seventeen years in the wilderness till they were<br/>overgrown with moss?" "My dear fellow, I've done nothing else. One<br/>forgets the whole world and all the worlds, and sticks to one such<br/>saint, because he is a very precious diamond. One such soul, you<br/>know, is sometimes worth a whole constellation. We have our system<br/>of reckoning, you know. The conquest is priceless! And some of<br/>them, on my word, are not inferior to you in culture, though you<br/>won't believe it. They can contemplate such depths of belief and<br/>disbelief at the same moment that sometimes it really seems that<br/>they are within a hair's-breadth of being 'turned upside down,' as<br/>the actor Gorbunov says." "Well, did you get your nose pulled?" "My<br/>dear fellow," observed the visitor sententiously, "it's better to<br/>get off with your nose pulled than without a nose at all. As an<br/>afflicted marquis observed not long ago (he must have been treated<br/>by a specialist) in confession to his spiritual father- a Jesuit. I<br/>was present, it was simply charming. 'Give me back my nose!' he<br/>said, and he beat his breast. 'My son,' said the priest evasively,<br/>'all things are accomplished in accordance with the inscrutable<br/>decrees of Providence, and what seems a misfortune sometimes leads<br/>to extraordinary, though unapparent, benefits. If stern destiny has<br/>deprived you of your nose, it's to your advantage that no one can<br/>ever pull you by your nose.' 'Holy father, that's no comfort,'<br/>cried the despairing marquis. 'I'd be delighted to have my nose<br/>pulled every day of my life, if it were only in its proper place.'<br/>'My son,' sighs the priest, 'you can't expect every blessing at<br/>once. This is murmuring against Providence, who even in this has<br/>not forgotten you, for if you repine as you repined just now,<br/>declaring you'd be glad to have your nose pulled for the rest of<br/>your life, your desire has already been fulfilled indirectly, for<br/>when you lost your nose, you were led by the nose.' "Fool, how<br/>stupid!" cried Ivan. "My dear friend, I only wanted to amuse you.<br/>But I swear that's the genuine Jesuit casuistry and I swear that it<br/>all happened word for word as I've told you. It happened lately and<br/>gave me a great deal of trouble. The unhappy young man shot himself<br/>that very night when he got home. I was by his side till the very<br/>last moment. Those Jesuit confessionals are really my most<br/>delightful diversion at melancholy moments. Here's another incident<br/>that happened only the other day. A little blonde Norman girl of<br/>twenty- a buxom, unsophisticated beauty that would make your mouth<br/>water- comes to an old priest. She bends down and whispers her sin<br/>into the grating. 'Why, my daughter, have you fallen again<br/>already?' cries the priest: 'O Sancta Maria, what do I hear! Not<br/>the same man this time, how long is this going on? Aren't you<br/>ashamed!' 'Ah, mon pere,' answers the sinner with tears of<br/>penitence, 'Ca lui fait tant de plaisir, et a moi si peu de<br/>peine!'* Fancy, such an answer! I drew back. It was the cry of<br/>nature, better than innocence itself, if you like. I absolved her<br/>sin on the spot and was turning to go, but I was forced to turn<br/>back. I heard the priest at the grating making an appointment with<br/>her for the evening- though he was an old man hard as flint, he<br/>fell in an instant! It was nature, the truth of nature asserted its<br/>rights! What, you are turning up your nose again? Angry again? I<br/>don't know how to please you-" Ah, my father, this gives him so<br/>much pleasure, and me so little pain! "Leave me alone, you are<br/>beating on my brain like a haunting nightmare," Ivan moaned<br/>miserably, helpless before his apparition. "I am bored with you,<br/>agonisingly and insufferably. I would give anything to be able to<br/>shake you off!" "I repeat, moderate your expectations, don't demand<br/>of me 'everything great and noble,' and you'll see how well we<br/>shall get on," said the gentleman impressively. "You are really<br/>angry with me for not having appeared to you in a red glow, with<br/>thunder and lightning, with scorched wings, but have shown myself<br/>in such a modest form. You are wounded, in the first place, in your<br/>asthetic feelings, and, secondly, in your pride. How could such a<br/>vulgar devil visit such a great man as you! Yes, there is that<br/>romantic strain in you, that was so derided by Byelinsky. I can't<br/>help it, young man, as I got ready to come to you I did think as a<br/>joke of appearing in the figure of a retired general who had served<br/>in the Caucasus, with a star of the Lion and the Sun on my coat.<br/>But I was positively afraid of doing it, for you'd have thrashed me<br/>for daring to pin the Lion and the Sun on my coat, instead of, at<br/>least, the Polar Star or the Sirius. And you keep on saying I am<br/>stupid, but, mercy on us! I make no claim to be equal to you in<br/>intelligence. Mephistopheles declared to Faust that he desired<br/>evil, but did only good. Well, he can say what he likes, it's quite<br/>the opposite with me. I am perhaps the one man in all creation who<br/>loves the truth and genuinely desires good. I was there when the<br/>Word, Who died on the Cross, rose up into heaven bearing on His<br/>bosom the soul of the penitent thief. I heard the glad shrieks of<br/>the cherubim singing and shouting hosannah and the thunderous<br/>rapture of the seraphim which shook heaven and all creation, and I<br/>swear to you by all that's sacred, I longed to join the choir and<br/>shout hosannah with them all. The word had almost escaped me, had<br/>almost broken from my lips… you know how susceptible and<br/>aesthetically impressionable I am. But common sense- oh, a most<br/>unhappy trait in my character- kept me in due bounds and I let the<br/>moment pass! For what would have happened, I reflected, what would<br/>have happened after my hosannah? Everything on earth would have<br/>been extinguished at once and no events could have occurred. And<br/>so, solely from a sense of duty and my social position, was forced<br/>to suppress the good moment and to stick to my nasty task. Somebody<br/>takes all the credit of what's good for Himself, and nothing but<br/>nastiness is left for me. But I don't envy the honour of a life of<br/>idle imposture, I am not ambitious. Why am I, of all creatures in<br/>the world, doomed to be cursed by all decent people and even to be<br/>kicked, for if I put on mortal form I am bound to take such<br/>consequences sometimes? I know, of course, there's a secret in it,<br/>but they won't tell me the secret for anything, for then perhaps,<br/>seeing the meaning of it, I might bawl hosannah, and the<br/>indispensable minus would disappear at once, and good sense would<br/>reign supreme throughout the whole world. And that, of course,<br/>would mean the end of everything, even of magazines and newspapers,<br/>for who would take them in? I know that at the end of all things I<br/>shall be reconciled. I, too, shall walk my quadrillion and learn<br/>the secret. But till that happens I am sulking and fulfil my<br/>destiny though it's against the grain- that is, to ruin thousands<br/>for the sake of saving one. How many souls have had to be ruined<br/>and how many honourable reputations destroyed for the sake of that<br/>one righteous man, Job, over whom they made such a fool of me in<br/>old days! Yes, till the secret is revealed, there are two sorts of<br/>truths for me- one, their truth, yonder, which I know nothing about<br/>so far, and the other my own. And there's no knowing which will<br/>turn out the better… . Are you asleep?" "I might well be," Ivan<br/>groaned angrily. "All my stupid ideas- outgrown, thrashed out long<br/>ago, and flung aside like a dead carcass you present to me as<br/>something new!" "There's no pleasing you! And I thought I should<br/>fascinate you by my literary style. That hosannah in the skies<br/>really wasn't bad, was it? And then that ironical tone a la Heine,<br/>eh?" "No, I was never such a flunkey! How then could my soul beget<br/>a flunkey like you?" "My dear fellow, I know a most charming and<br/>attractive young Russian gentleman, a young thinker and a great<br/>lover of literature and art, the author of a promising poem<br/>entitled The Grand Inquisitor. I was only thinking of him!" "I<br/>forbid you to speak of The Grand Inquisitor," cried Ivan, crimson<br/>with shame. "And the Geological Cataclysm. Do you remember? That<br/>was a poem, now!" "Hold your tongue, or I'll kill you!" "You'll<br/>kill me? No, excuse me, I will speak. I came to treat myself to<br/>that pleasure. Oh, I love the dreams of my ardent young friends,<br/>quivering with eagerness for life! 'There are new men,' you decided<br/>last spring, when you were meaning to come here, 'they propose to<br/>destroy everything and begin with cannibalism. Stupid fellows! they<br/>didn't ask my advice! I maintain that nothing need be destroyed,<br/>that we only need to destroy the idea of God in man, that's how we<br/>have to set to work. It's that, that we must begin with. Oh, blind<br/>race of men who have no understanding! As soon as men have all of<br/>them denied God- and I believe that period, analogous with<br/>geological periods, will come to pass- the old conception of the<br/>universe will fall of itself without cannibalism, and, what's more,<br/>the old morality, and everything will begin anew. Men will unite to<br/>take from life all it can give, but only for joy and happiness in<br/>the present world. Man will be lifted up with a spirit of divine<br/>Titanic pride and the man-god will appear. From hour to hour<br/>extending his conquest of nature infinitely by his will and his<br/>science, man will feel such lofty joy from hour to hour in doing it<br/>that it will make up for all his old dreams of the joys of heaven.<br/>Everyone will know that he is mortal and will accept death proudly<br/>and serenely like a god. His pride will teach him that it's useless<br/>for him to repine at life's being a moment, and he will love his<br/>brother without need of reward. Love will be sufficient only for a<br/>moment of life, but the very consciousness of its momentariness<br/>will intensify its fire, which now is dissipated in dreams of<br/>eternal love beyond the grave'… and so on and so on in the same<br/>style. Charming!" Ivan sat with his eyes on the floor, and his<br/>hands pressed to his ears, but he began trembling all over. The<br/>voice continued. "The question now is, my young thinker reflected,<br/>is it possible that such a period will ever come? If it does,<br/>everything is determined and humanity is settled for ever. But as,<br/>owing to man's inveterate stupidity, this cannot come about for at<br/>least a thousand years, everyone who recognises the truth even now<br/>may legitimately order his life as he pleases, on the new<br/>principles. In that sense, 'all things are lawful' for him. What's<br/>more, even if this period never comes to pass, since there is<br/>anyway no God and no immortality, the new man may well become the<br/>man-god, even if he is the only one in the whole world, and<br/>promoted to his new position, he may lightheartedly overstep all<br/>the barriers of the old morality of the old slaveman, if necessary.<br/>There is no law for God. Where God stands, the place is holy. Where<br/>I stand will be at once the foremost place… 'all things are lawful'<br/>and that's the end of it! That's all very charming; but if you want<br/>to swindle why do you want a moral sanction for doing it? But<br/>that's our modern Russian all over. He can't bring himself to<br/>swindle without a moral sanction. He is so in love with truth-" The<br/>visitor talked, obviously carried away by his own eloquence,<br/>speaking louder and louder and looking ironically at his host. But<br/>he did not succeed in finishing; Ivan suddenly snatched a glass<br/>from the table and flung it at the orator. "Ah, mais c'est bete<br/>enfin,"<br/>[18]<br/>cried the latter, jumping up from the<br/>sofa and shaking the drops of tea off himself. "He remembers<br/>Luther's inkstand! He takes me for a dream and throws glasses at a<br/>dream! It's like a woman! I suspected you were only pretending to<br/>stop up your ears." A loud, persistent knocking was suddenly heard<br/>at the window. Ivan jumped up from the sofa. "Do you hear? You'd<br/>better open," cried the visitor; "it's your brother Alyosha with<br/>the most interesting and surprising news, I'll be bound!" "Be<br/>silent, deceiver, I knew it was Alyosha, I felt he was coming, and<br/>of course he has not come for nothing; of course he brings 'news,'"<br/>Ivan exclaimed frantically. "Open, open to him. There's a snowstorm<br/>and he is your brother. Monsieur sait-il le temps qu'il fait? C'est<br/>a ne pas mettre un chien dehors." Does the gentleman know the<br/>weather he's making? It's not weather for a dog. The knocking<br/>continued. Ivan wanted to rush to the window, but something seemed<br/>to fetter his arms and legs. He strained every effort to break his<br/>chains, but in vain. The knocking at the window grew louder and<br/>louder. At last the chains were broken and Ivan leapt up from the<br/>sofa. He looked round him wildly. Both candles had almost burnt<br/>out, the glass he had just thrown at his visitor stood before him<br/>on the table, and there was no one on the sofa opposite. The<br/>knocking on the window frame went on persistently, but it was by no<br/>means so loud as it had seemed in his dream; on the contrary, it<br/>was quite subdued. "It was not a dream! No, I swear it was not a<br/>dream, it all happened just now!" cried Ivan. He rushed to the<br/>window and opened the movable pane. "Alyosha, I told you not to<br/>come," he cried fiercely to his brother. "In two words, what do you<br/>want? In two words, do you hear?" "An hour ago Smerdyakov hanged<br/>himself," Alyosha answered from the yard. "Come round to the steps,<br/>I'll open at once," said Ivan, going to open the door to<br/>Alyosha.<br/>
