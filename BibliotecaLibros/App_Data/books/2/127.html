<br/>"That's enough. One glass won't kill me."<br/><br/>"You see you are in a better humour now," said Alyosha,<br/>smiling.<br/><br/>"Um! I love you even without the brandy, but with scoundrels I<br/>am a scoundrel. Ivan is not going to Tchermashnya- why is that? He<br/>wants to spy how much I give Grushenka if she comes. They are all<br/>scoundrels! But I don't recognise Ivan, I don't know him at all.<br/>Where does he come from? He is not one of us in soul. As though I'd<br/>leave him anything! I shan't leave a will at all, you may as well<br/>know. And I'll crush Mitya like a beetle. I squash black-beetles at<br/>night with my slipper; they squelch when you tread on them. And<br/>your Mitya will squelch too. Your Mitya, for you love him. Yes you<br/>love him and I am not afraid of your loving him. But if Ivan loved<br/>him I should be afraid for myself at his loving him. But Ivan loves<br/>nobody. Ivan is not one of us. People like Ivan are not our sort,<br/>my boy. They are like a cloud of dust. When the wind blows, the<br/>dust will be goneâ€¦ . I had a silly idea in my head when I told you<br/>to come to-day; I wanted to find out from you about Mitya. If I<br/>were to hand him over a thousand or maybe two now, would the<br/>beggarly wretch agree to take himself off altogether for five years<br/>or, better still, thirty-five, and without Grushenka, and give her<br/>up once for all, eh?"<br/><br/>"I- I'll ask him," muttered Alyosha. "If you would give him<br/>three thousand, perhaps he-"<br/><br/>"That's nonsense! You needn't ask him now, no need! I've changed<br/>my mind. It was a nonsensical idea of mine. I won't give him<br/>anything, not a penny, I want my money myself," cried the old man,<br/>waving his hand. "I'll crush him like a beetle without it. Don't<br/>say anything to him or else he will begin hoping. There's nothing<br/>for you to do here, you needn't stay. Is that betrothed of his,<br/>Katerina Ivanovna, whom he has kept so carefully hidden from me all<br/>this time, going to marry him or not? You went to see her<br/>yesterday, I believe?"<br/><br/>"Nothing will induce her to abandon him."<br/><br/>"There you see how dearly these fine young ladies love a rake<br/>and a scoundrel. They are poor creatures I tell you, those pale<br/>young ladies, very different from- Ah, if I had his youth and the<br/>looks I had then (for I was better-looking than he at eight and<br/>twenty) I'd have been a conquering hero just as he is. He is a low<br/>cad! But he shan't have Grushenka, anyway, he shan't! I'll crush<br/>him!"<br/><br/>His anger had returned with the last words.<br/><br/>"You can go. There's nothing for you to do here to-day," he<br/>snapped harshly.<br/><br/>Alyosha went up to say good-bye to him, and kissed him on the<br/>shoulder.<br/><br/>
