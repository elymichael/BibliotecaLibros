Who smirch'd thus and mired with infamy,<br/>I might have said 'No part of it is mine;<br/>This shame derives itself from unknown loins'?<br/>But mine and mine I loved and mine I praised<br/>And mine that I was proud on, mine so much<br/>That I myself was to myself not mine,<br/>Valuing of her,â€”why, she, O, she is fallen<br/>Into a pit of ink, that the wide sea<br/>Hath drops too few to wash her clean again<br/>And salt too little which may season give<br/>To her foul-tainted flesh!<br/><br/><br/>BENEDICK<br/><br/><br/>Sir, sir, be patient.<br/>For my part, I am so attired in wonder,<br/>I know not what to say.<br/><br/><br/>
