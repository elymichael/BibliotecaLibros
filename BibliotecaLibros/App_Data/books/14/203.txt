Well, masters, we hear our charge: let us go sit here
upon the church-bench till two, and then all to bed.


DOGBERRY


One word more, honest neighbours. I pray you watch
about Signior Leonato's door; for the wedding being
there to-morrow, there is a great coil to-night.
Adieu: be vigitant, I beseech you.

Exeunt DOGBERRY and VERGES

Enter BORACHIO and CONRADE


BORACHIO


What Conrade!
