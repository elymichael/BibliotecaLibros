There is some strange misprision in the princes.<br/><br/><br/>BENEDICK<br/><br/><br/>Two of them have the very bent of honour;<br/>And if their wisdoms be misled in this,<br/>The practise of it lives in John the bastard,<br/>Whose spirits toil in frame of villanies.<br/><br/><br/>LEONATO<br/><br/><br/>I know not. If they speak but truth of her,<br/>These hands shall tear her; if they wrong her honour,<br/>The proudest of them shall well hear of it.<br/>Time hath not yet so dried this blood of mine,<br/>Nor age so eat up my invention,<br/>Nor fortune made such havoc of my means,<br/>
