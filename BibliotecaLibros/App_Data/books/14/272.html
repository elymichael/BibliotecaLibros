Out of all eyes, tongues, minds and injuries.<br/><br/><br/>BENEDICK<br/><br/><br/>Signior Leonato, let the friar advise you:<br/>And though you know my inwardness and love<br/>Is very much unto the prince and Claudio,<br/>Yet, by mine honour, I will deal in this<br/>As secretly and justly as your soul<br/>Should with your body.<br/><br/><br/>LEONATO<br/><br/><br/>Being that I flow in grief,<br/>The smallest twine may lead me.<br/><br/><br/>
