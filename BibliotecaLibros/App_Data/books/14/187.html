DON JOHN<br/><br/><br/>The word is too good to paint out her wickedness; I<br/>could say she were worse: think you of a worse<br/>title, and I will fit her to it. Wonder not till<br/>further warrant: go but with me to-night, you shall<br/>see her chamber-window entered, even the night<br/>before her wedding-day: if you love her then,<br/>to-morrow wed her; but it would better fit your honour<br/>to change your mind.<br/><br/><br/>CLAUDIO<br/><br/><br/>May this be so?<br/><br/><br/>DON PEDRO<br/><br/>
