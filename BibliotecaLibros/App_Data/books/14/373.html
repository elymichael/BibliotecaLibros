<br/>Exit ANTONIO<br/><br/><br/>DON PEDRO<br/><br/><br/>Good morrow, Benedick. Why, what's the matter,<br/>That you have such a February face,<br/>So full of frost, of storm and cloudiness?<br/><br/><br/>CLAUDIO<br/><br/><br/>I think he thinks upon the savage bull.<br/>Tush, fear not, man; we'll tip thy horns with gold<br/>And all Europa shall rejoice at thee,<br/>As once Europa did at lusty Jove,<br/>When he would play the noble beast in love.<br/><br/>
