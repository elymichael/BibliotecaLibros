<br/><br/>CLAUDIO<br/><br/><br/>Yet say I, he is in love.<br/><br/><br/>DON PEDRO<br/><br/><br/>There is no appearance of fancy in him, unless it be<br/>a fancy that he hath to strange disguises; as, to be<br/>a Dutchman today, a Frenchman to-morrow, or in the<br/>shape of two countries at once, as, a German from<br/>the waist downward, all slops, and a Spaniard from<br/>the hip upward, no doublet. Unless he have a fancy<br/>to this foolery, as it appears he hath, he is no<br/>fool for fancy, as you would have it appear he is.<br/><br/><br/>
