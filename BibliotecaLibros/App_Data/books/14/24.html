Well, you are a rare parrot-teacher.<br/><br/><br/>BEATRICE<br/><br/><br/>A bird of my tongue is better than a beast of yours.<br/><br/><br/>BENEDICK<br/><br/><br/>I would my horse had the speed of your tongue, and<br/>so good a continuer. But keep your way, i' God's<br/>name; I have done.<br/><br/><br/>BEATRICE<br/><br/><br/>You always end with a jade's trick: I know you of old.<br/>
