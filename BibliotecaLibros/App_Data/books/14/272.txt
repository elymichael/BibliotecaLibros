Out of all eyes, tongues, minds and injuries.


BENEDICK


Signior Leonato, let the friar advise you:
And though you know my inwardness and love
Is very much unto the prince and Claudio,
Yet, by mine honour, I will deal in this
As secretly and justly as your soul
Should with your body.


LEONATO


Being that I flow in grief,
The smallest twine may lead me.
