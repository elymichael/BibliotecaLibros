Dost thou not suspect my place? dost thou not<br/>suspect my years? O that he were here to write me<br/>down an ass! But, masters, remember that I am an<br/>ass; though it be not written down, yet forget not<br/>that I am an ass. No, thou villain, thou art full of<br/>piety, as shall be proved upon thee by good witness.<br/>I am a wise fellow, and, which is more, an officer,<br/>and, which is more, a householder, and, which is<br/>more, as pretty a piece of flesh as any is in<br/>Messina, and one that knows the law, go to; and a<br/>rich fellow enough, go to; and a fellow that hath<br/>had losses, and one that hath two gowns and every<br/>thing handsome about him. Bring him away. O that<br/>I had been writ down an ass!<br/><br/>Exeunt<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
