Possess the people in Messina here<br/>How innocent she died; and if your love<br/>Can labour ought in sad invention,<br/>Hang her an epitaph upon her tomb<br/>And sing it to her bones, sing it to-night:<br/>To-morrow morning come you to my house,<br/>And since you could not be my son-in-law,<br/>Be yet my nephew: my brother hath a daughter,<br/>Almost the copy of my child that's dead,<br/>And she alone is heir to both of us:<br/>Give her the right you should have given her cousin,<br/>And so dies my revenge.<br/><br/><br/>CLAUDIO<br/><br/><br/>O noble sir,<br/>Your over-kindness doth wring tears from me!<br/>I do embrace your offer; and dispose<br/>For henceforth of poor Claudio.<br/>
