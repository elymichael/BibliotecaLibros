Sings<br/><br/>The god of love,<br/>That sits above,<br/>And knows me, and knows me,<br/>How pitiful I deserve,â€”<br/>I mean in singing; but in loving, Leander the good<br/>swimmer, Troilus the first employer of panders, and<br/>a whole bookful of these quondam carpet-mangers,<br/>whose names yet run smoothly in the even road of a<br/>blank verse, why, they were never so truly turned<br/>over and over as my poor self in love. Marry, I<br/>cannot show it in rhyme; I have tried: I can find<br/>out no rhyme to 'lady' but 'baby,' an innocent<br/>rhyme; for 'scorn,' 'horn,' a hard rhyme; for,<br/>'school,' 'fool,' a babbling rhyme; very ominous<br/>endings: no, I was not born under a rhyming planet,<br/>nor I cannot woo in festival terms.<br/><br/>Enter BEATRICE<br/><br/>
