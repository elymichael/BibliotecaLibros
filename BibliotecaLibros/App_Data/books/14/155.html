<br/>BENEDICK<br/><br/><br/>Ha! 'Against my will I am sent to bid you come in<br/>to dinner;' there's a double meaning in that 'I took<br/>no more pains for those thanks than you took pains<br/>to thank me.' that's as much as to say, Any pains<br/>that I take for you is as easy as thanks. If I do<br/>not take pity of her, I am a villain; if I do not<br/>love her, I am a Jew. I will go get her picture.<br/><br/>Exit<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
