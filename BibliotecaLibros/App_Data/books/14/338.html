<br/>BORACHIO<br/><br/><br/>Yea, even I alone.<br/><br/><br/>LEONATO<br/><br/><br/>No, not so, villain; thou beliest thyself:<br/>Here stand a pair of honourable men;<br/>A third is fled, that had a hand in it.<br/>I thank you, princes, for my daughter's death:<br/>Record it with your high and worthy deeds:<br/>'Twas bravely done, if you bethink you of it.<br/><br/><br/>CLAUDIO<br/><br/><br/>
