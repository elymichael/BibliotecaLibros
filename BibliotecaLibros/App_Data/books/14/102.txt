DON PEDRO


I' faith, lady, I think your blazon to be true;
though, I'll be sworn, if he be so, his conceit is
false. Here, Claudio, I have wooed in thy name, and
fair Hero is won: I have broke with her father,
and his good will obtained: name the day of
marriage, and God give thee joy!


LEONATO


Count, take of me my daughter, and with her my
fortunes: his grace hath made the match, and an
grace say Amen to it.
