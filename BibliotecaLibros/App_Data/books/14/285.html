<br/><br/>BENEDICK<br/><br/><br/>Beatâ€”<br/><br/><br/>BEATRICE<br/><br/><br/>Princes and counties! Surely, a princely testimony,<br/>a goodly count, Count Comfect; a sweet gallant,<br/>surely! O that I were a man for his sake! or that I<br/>had any friend would be a man for my sake! But<br/>manhood is melted into courtesies, valour into<br/>compliment, and men are only turned into tongue, and<br/>trim ones too: he is now as valiant as Hercules<br/>that only tells a lie and swears it. I cannot be a<br/>man with wishing, therefore I will die a woman with<br/>grieving.<br/><br/>
