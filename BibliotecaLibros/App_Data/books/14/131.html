The Song<br/><br/><br/>BALTHASAR<br/><br/><br/>Sigh no more, ladies, sigh no more,<br/>Men were deceivers ever,<br/>One foot in sea and one on shore,<br/>To one thing constant never:<br/>Then sigh not so, but let them go,<br/>And be you blithe and bonny,<br/>Converting all your sounds of woe<br/>Into Hey nonny, nonny.<br/>Sing no more ditties, sing no moe,<br/>Of dumps so dull and heavy;<br/>The fraud of men was ever so,<br/>Since summer first was leafy:<br/>Then sigh not so, &amp; c.<br/><br/><br/>
