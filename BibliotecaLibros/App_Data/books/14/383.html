BENEDICK<br/><br/><br/>A miracle! here's our own hands against our hearts.<br/>Come, I will have thee; but, by this light, I take<br/>thee for pity.<br/><br/><br/>BEATRICE<br/><br/><br/>I would not deny you; but, by this good day, I yield<br/>upon great persuasion; and partly to save your life,<br/>for I was told you were in a consumption.<br/><br/><br/>BENEDICK<br/><br/><br/>Peace! I will stop your mouth.<br/><br/>
