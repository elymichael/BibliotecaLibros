But I persuaded them, if they loved Benedick,
To wish him wrestle with affection,
And never to let Beatrice know of it.


URSULA


Why did you so? Doth not the gentleman
Deserve as full as fortunate a bed
As ever Beatrice shall couch upon?


HERO


O god of love! I know he doth deserve
As much as may be yielded to a man:
But Nature never framed a woman's heart
Of prouder stuff than that of Beatrice;
Disdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes,
