<br/><br/>DON PEDRO<br/><br/><br/>And Benedick is not the unhopefullest husband that<br/>I know. Thus far can I praise him; he is of a noble<br/>strain, of approved valour and confirmed honesty. I<br/>will teach you how to humour your cousin, that she<br/>shall fall in love with Benedick; and I, with your<br/>two helps, will so practise on Benedick that, in<br/>despite of his quick wit and his queasy stomach, he<br/>shall fall in love with Beatrice. If we can do this,<br/>Cupid is no longer an archer: hi s glory shall be<br/>ours, for we are the only love-gods. Go in with me,<br/>and I will tell you my drift.<br/><br/>Exeunt<br/><br/><br/><br/>
