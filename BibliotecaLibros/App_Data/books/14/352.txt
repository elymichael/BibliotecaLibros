Sweet Beatrice, wouldst thou come when I called thee?


BEATRICE


Yea, signior, and depart when you bid me.


BENEDICK


O, stay but till then!


BEATRICE


'Then' is spoken; fare you well now: and yet, ere
I go, let me go with that I came; which is, with
knowing what hath passed between you and Claudio.
