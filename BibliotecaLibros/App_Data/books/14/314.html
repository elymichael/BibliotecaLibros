I know them, yea,<br/>And what they weigh, even to the utmost scruple,—<br/>Scrambling, out-facing, fashion-monging boys,<br/>That lie and cog and flout, deprave and slander,<br/>Go anticly, show outward hideousness,<br/>And speak off half a dozen dangerous words,<br/>How they might hurt their enemies, if they durst;<br/>And this is all.<br/><br/><br/>LEONATO<br/><br/><br/>But, brother Antony,—<br/><br/><br/>ANTONIO<br/>
