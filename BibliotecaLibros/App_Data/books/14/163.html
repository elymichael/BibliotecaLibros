She would swear the gentleman should be her sister;<br/>If black, why, Nature, drawing of an antique,<br/>Made a foul blot; if tall, a lance ill-headed;<br/>If low, an agate very vilely cut;<br/>If speaking, why, a vane blown with all winds;<br/>If silent, why, a block moved with none.<br/>So turns she every man the wrong side out<br/>And never gives to truth and virtue that<br/>Which simpleness and merit purchaseth.<br/><br/><br/>URSULA<br/><br/><br/>Sure, sure, such carping is not commendable.<br/><br/><br/>HERO<br/><br/><br/>No, not to be so odd and from all fashions<br/>
