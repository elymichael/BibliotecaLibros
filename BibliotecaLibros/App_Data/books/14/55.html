fair weather that you make yourself: it is needful<br/>that you frame the season for your own harvest.<br/><br/><br/>DON JOHN<br/><br/><br/>I had rather be a canker in a hedge than a rose in<br/>his grace, and it better fits my blood to be<br/>disdained of all than to fashion a carriage to rob<br/>love from any: in this, though I cannot be said to<br/>be a flattering honest man, it must not be denied<br/>but I am a plain-dealing villain. I am trusted with<br/>a muzzle and enfranchised with a clog; therefore I<br/>have decreed not to sing in my cage. If I had my<br/>mouth, I would bite; if I had my liberty, I would do<br/>my liking: in the meantime let me be that I am and<br/>seek not to alter me.<br/><br/><br/>CONRADE<br/>
