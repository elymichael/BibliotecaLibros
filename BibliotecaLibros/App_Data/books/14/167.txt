HERO


Why, every day, to-morrow. Come, go in:
I'll show thee some attires, and have thy counsel
Which is the best to furnish me to-morrow.


URSULA


She's limed, I warrant you: we have caught her, madam.


HERO


If it proves so, then loving goes by haps:
Some Cupid kills with arrows, some with traps.
