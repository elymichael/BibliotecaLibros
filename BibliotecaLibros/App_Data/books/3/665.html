<br/>Frantic, delirious! thou art lost for ever!<br/>Is it in vain that thou hast ears to hear,<br/>And hast thou neither shame nor reason left?<br/>How? hear'st thou not the Goddess? the report<br/>Of white-arm'd Juno from Olympian Jove<br/>Return'd this moment? or perfer'st thou rather,<br/>Plagued with a thousand woes, and under force<br/>Of sad necessity to seek again<br/>Olympus, and at thy return to prove<br/>Author of countless miseries to us all?<br/>For He at once Grecians and Trojans both<br/>Abandoning, will hither haste prepared<br/>To tempest&#160;us in heaven, whom he will seize,<br/>The guilty and the guiltless, all alike.<br/>I bid thee, therefore, patient bear the death<br/>Of thy Ascalaphus; braver than he<br/>And abler have, ere now, in battle fallen,<br/>And shall hereafter; arduous were the task<br/>To rescue from the stroke of fate the race<br/>Of mortal men, with all their progeny.<br/>
