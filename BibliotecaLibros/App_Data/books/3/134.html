Brethren, dear daughter, and companions dear,<br/>A wanderer with thy son. Yet I alas!<br/>Died not, and therefore now, live but to weep.<br/>But I resolve thee. Thou behold'st the son<br/>Of Atreus, Agamemnon, mighty king,<br/>In arms heroic, gracious in the throne,<br/>And, (though it shame me now to call him such,)<br/>By nuptial ties a brother once to me.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Then him the ancient King-admiring, said.<br/>Oh blest Atrides, happy was thy birth,<br/>And thy lot glorious, whom this gallant host<br/>So numerous, of the sons of Greece obey!<br/>To vine-famed Phrygia, in my days of youth,<br/>I journey'd; many Phrygians there I saw,<br/>Brave horsemen, and expert; they were the powers<br/>Of Otreus and of Mygdon, godlike Chief,<br/>And on the banks of Sangar's stream encamp'd.<br/>I march'd among them, chosen in that war<br/>
