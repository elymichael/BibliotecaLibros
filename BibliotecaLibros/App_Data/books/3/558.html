Of that huge mass, flew scatter'd on all sides.<br/>In leap'd the godlike Hero at the breach,<br/>Gloomy as night in aspect, but in arms<br/>All-dazzling, and he grasp'd two quivering spears.<br/>Him entering with a leap the gates, no force<br/>Whate'er of opposition had repress'd,<br/>Save of the Gods alone. Fire fill'd his eyes;<br/>Turning, he bade the multitude without<br/>Ascend the rampart; they his voice obey'd;<br/>Part climb'd the wall, part pour'd into the gate;<br/>The Grecians to their hollow galleys flew<br/>Scatter'd, and tumult infinite arose.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
