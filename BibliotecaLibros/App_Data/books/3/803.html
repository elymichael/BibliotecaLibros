Robust of Phœnix, him she thus bespake.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Shame, Menelaus, shall to thee redound<br/>For ever, and reproach, should dogs devour<br/>The faithful friend of Peleus' noble son<br/>Under Troy's battlements; but stand, thyself,<br/>Undaunted, and encourage all the host.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>To whom the son of Atreus bold in arms.<br/>Ah, Phœnix, friend revered, ancient and sage!<br/>Would Pallas give me might and from the dint<br/>Shield me of dart and spear, with willing mind<br/>I would defend Patroclus, for his death<br/>Hath touch'd me deep. But Hector with the rage<br/>Burns of consuming fire, nor to his spear<br/>Gives pause, for him Jove leads to victory.<br/><br/>
