Him answer'd then heroic Hector huge.<br/>Since, Ajax, the immortal powers on thee<br/>Have bulk pre-eminent and strength bestow'd,<br/>With such address in battle, that the host<br/>Of Greece hath not thine equal at the spear,<br/>Now let the combat cease. We shall not want<br/>More fair occasion; on some future day<br/>We will not part till all-disposing heaven<br/>Shall give thee victory, or shall make her mine.<br/>But Night hath fallen, and Night must be obey'd,<br/>That them may'st gratify with thy return<br/>The Achaians, and especially thy friends<br/>And thy own countrymen. I go, no less<br/>To exhilarate in Priam's royal town<br/>Men and robed matrons, who shall seek the Gods<br/>For me, with pious ceremonial due.<br/>But come. We will exchange, or ere we part,<br/>Some princely gift, that Greece and Troy may say<br/>Hereafter, with soul-wasting rage they fought,<br/>But parted with the gentleness of friends.<br/><br/>
