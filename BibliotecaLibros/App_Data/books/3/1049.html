As ill become you. Ye would feel, yourselves,<br/>Resentment, should another act as ye.<br/>Survey the course, peaceable, from your seats;<br/>The charioteers, by competition wing'd,<br/>Will soon themselves arrive, then shall ye know<br/>Distinctly, both who follows and who leads.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>He scarce had said, when nigh at hand appear'd<br/>Tydides, lashing, as he came, his steeds<br/>Continual; they with hoofs uplifted high<br/>Their yet remaining ground shorten'd apace,<br/>Sprinkling with dusty drops at every stroke<br/>Their charioteer, while close upon their heels<br/>Radiant with tin and gold the chariot ran,<br/>Scarce tracking light the dust, so swift they flew.<br/>He stood in the mid-circus; there the sweat<br/>Rain'd under them from neck and chest profuse,<br/>And Diomede from his resplendent seat<br/>Leaping, reclined his scourge against the yoke.<br/>
