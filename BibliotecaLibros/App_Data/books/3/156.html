<br/><br/><br/>Book IV<br/><br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>ARGUMENT OF THE FOURTH BOOK.<br/><br/>In a Council of the Gods, a dispute arises between Jupiter and<br/>Juno, which is at last compromised, Jove consenting to dispatch<br/>Minerva with a charge to incite some Trojan to a violation of the<br/>truce. Minerva descends for that purpose, and in the form of<br/>Laodocus, a son of Priam, exhorts Pandarus to shoot at Menelaus,<br/>and succeeds. Menelaus is wounded, and Agamemnon having consigned<br/>him to the care of Machaon, goes forth to perform the duties of<br/>commander-in-chief, in the encouragement of his host to battle. The<br/>battle begins.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>Now, on the golden floor of Jove's abode<br/>The Gods all sat consulting; Hebe them,<br/>Graceful, with nectar served;&#160;they pledging each<br/>His next, alternate quaff'd from cups of gold,<br/>And at their ease reclined, look'd down on Troy,<br/>When, sudden, Jove essay'd by piercing speech<br/>Invidious, to enkindle Juno's ire.<br/>
