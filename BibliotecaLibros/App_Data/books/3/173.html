Argives! abate no spark of all your fire.<br/>Jove will not prosper traitors. Them who first<br/>Transgress'd the truce the vultures shall devour,<br/>But we (their city taken) shall their wives<br/>Lead captive, and their children home to Greece.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>So cheer'd he them. But whom he saw supine,<br/>Or in the rugged work of war remiss,<br/>In terms of anger them he stern rebuked.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Oh Greeks! The shame of Argos! Arrow-doom'd!<br/>Blush ye not? Wherefore stand ye thus aghast,<br/>Like fawns which wearied after scouring wide<br/>The champain, gaze and pant, and can no more?<br/>Senseless like them ye stand, nor seek the fight.<br/>Is it your purpose patient here to wait<br/>Till Troy invade your vessels on the shore<br/>
