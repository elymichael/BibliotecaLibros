Alas! how vain against the Thunderer's will
Our anger, and the hope to supersede
His purpose, by persuasion or by force!
He solitary sits, all unconcern'd
At our resentment, and himself proclaims
Mightiest and most to be revered in heaven.
Be patient, therefore, and let each endure
Such ills as Jove may send him. Mars, I ween,
Already hath his share; the warrior God
Hath lost Ascalaphus, of all mankind
His most beloved, and whom he calls his own.

She spake, and with expanded palms his thighs
Smiling, thus, sorrowful, the God exclaim'd.
