Exadius, Cœneus, and the Godlike son<br/>Of Ægeus, mighty Theseus; men renown'd<br/>For force superior to the race of man,<br/>Brave Chiefs they were, and with brave foes they fought,<br/>With the rude dwellers on the mountain-heights<br/>The Centaurs,&#160;whom with havoc such as fame<br/>Shall never cease to celebrate, they slew.<br/>With these men I consorted erst, what time<br/>From Pylus, though a land from theirs remote,<br/>They called me forth, and such as was my strength,<br/>With all that strength I served them. Who is he?<br/>What Prince or Chief of the degenerate race<br/>Now seen on earth who might with these compare?<br/>Yet even these would listen and conform<br/>To my advice in consultation given,<br/>Which hear ye also; for compliance proves<br/>Oft times the safer and the manlier course.<br/>Thou, Agamemnon! valiant as thou art,<br/>Seize not the maid, his portion from the Greeks,<br/>But leave her his; nor thou, Achilles, strive<br/>With our imperial Chief; for never King<br/>
