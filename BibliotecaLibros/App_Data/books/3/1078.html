<br/>Atrides! (for we know thy skill and force<br/>Matchless! that none can hurl the spear as thou)<br/>This prize is thine, order it to thy ship;<br/>And if it please thee, as I would it might,<br/>Let brave Meriones the spear receive.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>He said; nor Agamemnon not complied,<br/>But to Meriones the brazen spear<br/>Presenting, to Talthybius gave in charge<br/>The caldron, next, his own illustrious prize.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
