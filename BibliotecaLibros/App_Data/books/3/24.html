But, distribution made, thy lot exceeds<br/>Mine far; while I, with any pittance pleased,<br/>Bear to my ships the little that I win<br/>After long battle, and account it much.<br/>But I am gone, I and my sable barks<br/>(My wiser course) to Phthia, and I judge,<br/>Scorn'd as I am, that thou shalt hardly glean<br/>Without me, more than thou shalt soon consume.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>He ceased, and Agamemnon thus replied<br/>Fly, and fly now; if in thy soul thou feel<br/>Such ardor of desire to goâ€”begone!<br/>I woo thee not to stay; stay not an hour<br/>On my behalf, for I have others here<br/>Who will respect me more, and above all<br/>All-judging Jove. There is not in the host<br/>King or commander whom I hate as thee,<br/>For all thy pleasure is in strife and blood,<br/>And at all times; yet valor is no ground<br/>
