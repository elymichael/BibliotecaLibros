&#160;<br/><br/>So saying, Ulysses' oval disk he smote.<br/>Through his bright disk the stormy weapon flew,<br/>Transpierced his twisted mail, and from his side<br/>Drove all the skin, but to his nobler parts<br/>Found entrance none, by Pallas turn'd aslant.<br/>Ulysses, conscious of his life untouch'd,<br/>Retired a step from Socus, and replied.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Ah hapless youth; thy fate is on the wing;<br/>Me thou hast forced indeed to cease a while<br/>From battle with the Trojans, but I speak<br/>Thy death at hand; for vanquish'd by my spear,<br/>This self-same day thou shalt to me resign<br/>Thy fame, thy soul to Pluto steed-renown'd.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>
