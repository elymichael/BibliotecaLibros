In his ascent to heaven smote on the fields.<br/>When Greeks and Trojans met. Scarce could the slain<br/>Be clear distinguish'd, but they cleansed from each<br/>His clotted gore with water, and warm tears<br/>Distilling copious, heaved them to the wains.<br/>But wailing none was heard, for such command<br/>Had Priam issued; therefore heaping high<br/>The bodies, silent and with sorrowing hearts<br/>They burn'd them, and to sacred Troy return'd.<br/>The Grecians also, on the funeral pile<br/>The bodies heaping sad, burn'd them with fire<br/>Together, and return'd into the fleet.<br/>Then, ere the peep of dawn, and while the veil<br/>Of night, though thinner, still o'erhung the earth,<br/>Achaians, chosen from the rest, the pile<br/>Encompass'd. With a tomb (one tomb for all)<br/>They crown'd the spot adust, and to the tomb<br/>(For safety of their fleet and of themselves)<br/>Strong fortress added of high wall and tower,<br/>With solid gates affording egress thence<br/>Commodious to the mounted charioteer;<br/>
