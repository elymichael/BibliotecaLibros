<br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Laertes' noble son, for wiles renown'd!<br/>Art thou too fugitive, and turn'st thy back<br/>Like the base multitude? Ah! fear a lance<br/>Implanted ignominious in thy spine.<br/>Stopâ€”Nestor dies. Fell Hector is at hand.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>So shouted Diomede, whose summons loud,<br/>Ulysses yet heard not, but, passing, flew<br/>With headlong haste to the Achaian fleet.<br/>Then, Diomede, unaided as he was,<br/>Rush'd ardent to the vanward, and before<br/>The steeds of the Neleian sovereign old<br/>Standing, in accents wing'd, him thus address'd.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>
