Big<br/>words on small matters<br/>may serve as a pretty exact definition<br/>of the burlesque; an instance of which they will find in the Battle<br/>of the Frogs and Mice, but none in the Iliad.<br/><br/>By others I expect to be told that my numbers, though here and<br/>there tolerably smooth, are not always such, but have, now and<br/>then, an ugly hitch in their gait, ungraceful in itself, and<br/>inconvenient to the reader. To this charge also I plead guilty, but<br/>beg leave in alleviation of judgment to add, that my limping lines<br/>are not numerous, compared with those that limp not. The truth is,<br/>that not one of them all escaped me, but, such as they are, they<br/>were all made such with a wilful intention. In poems of great<br/>length there is no blemish more to be feared than sameness of<br/>numbers, and every art is useful by which it may be avoided. A<br/>line, rough in itself, has yet its recommendations; it saves the<br/>ear the pain of an irksome monotony, and seems even to add greater<br/>smoothness to others. Milton, whose ear and taste were exquisite,<br/>has exemplified in his Paradise Lost the effect of this practice<br/>frequently.<br/><br/>x<br/>Having mentioned Milton, I cannot but add<br/>an observation on the similitude of his manner to that of Homer. It<br/>is such, that no person familiar with both, can read either without<br/>being reminded of the other; and it is in those breaks and pauses,<br/>to which the numbers of the English poet are so much indebted both<br/>for their dignity and variety, that he chiefly copies the Grecian.<br/>But these are graces to which rhyme is not competent; so broken, it<br/>loses all its music; of which any person may convince himself by<br/>reading a page only of any of our poets anterior to Denham, Waller,<br/>and Dryden. A translator of Homer, therefore, seems directed by<br/>Homer himself to the use of blank verse, as to that alone in which<br/>he can be rendered with any tolerable representation of his manner<br/>in this particular. A remark which I am naturally led to make by a<br/>desire to conciliate, if possible, some, who, rather unreasonably<br/>partial to rhyme, demand it on all occasions, and seem persuaded<br/>that poetry in our language is a vain attempt without it. Verse,<br/>that claims to be verse in right of its metre only, they judge to<br/>be such rather by courtesy than by kind, on an apprehension that it<br/>costs the writer little trouble, that he has only to give his lines<br/>their prescribed number of syllables, and so far as the mechanical<br/>part is concerned, all is well. Were this true, they would have<br/>reason on their side; for the author is certainly best entitled to<br/>applause who succeeds against the greatest difficulty, and in verse<br/>that calls for the most artificial management in its construction.<br/>But the case is not as they suppose. To rhyme, in our language,<br/>demands no great exertion of ingenuity, but is always easy to a<br/>person exercised in the practice. Witness the multitudes who rhyme,<br/>but have no other poetical pretensions. Let it be considered too,<br/>how merciful we are apt to be to unclassical and indifferent<br/>language for the sake of rhyme, and we shall soon see that the<br/>labor lies principally on the other side. Many ornaments of no easy<br/>purchase are required to atone for the absence of this single<br/>recommendation. It is not sufficient that the lines of blank verse<br/>be smooth in themselves, they must also be harmonious in the<br/>combination. Whereas the chief concern of the rhymist is to beware<br/>that his couplets and his sense be commensurate, lest the<br/>regularity of his numbers should be (too frequently at least)<br/>interrupted. A trivial difficulty this, compared with those which<br/>attend the poet unaccompanied by his bells. He, in order that he<br/>may be musical, must exhibit all the variations, as he proceeds, of<br/>which ten syllables are susceptible; between the first syllable and<br/>the last there is no place at which he must not occasionally pause,<br/>and the place of the pause must be perpetually shifted. To effect<br/>this variety, his attention must be given, at one and the same<br/>time, to the pauses he has already made in the period before him,<br/>as well as to that which he is about to make, and to those which<br/>shall succeed it. On no lighter terms than these is it possible<br/>that blank verse can be written which will not, in the course of a<br/>long work, fatigue the ear past all endurance. If it be easier,<br/>therefore, to throw five balls into the air and to catch them in<br/>succession, than to sport in that manner with one only, then may<br/>blank verse be more easily fabricated than rhyme. And if to these<br/>labors we add others equally requisite, a style in general more<br/>elaborate than rhyme requires, farther removed from the vernacular<br/>idiom both in the language xi<br/>itself and in the<br/>arrangement of it, we shall not long doubt which of these two very<br/>different species of verse threatens the composer with most expense<br/>of study and contrivance. I feel it unpleasant to appeal to my own<br/>experience, but, having no other voucher at hand, am constrained to<br/>it. As I affirm, so I have found. I have dealt pretty largely in<br/>both kinds, and have frequently written more verses in a day, with<br/>tags, than I could ever write without them. To what has been here<br/>said (which whether it have been said by others or not, I cannot<br/>tell, having never read any modern book on the subject) I shall<br/>only add, that to be poetical without rhyme, is an argument of a<br/>sound and classical constitution in any language.<br/><br/>A word or two on the subject of the following translation, and I<br/>have done.<br/><br/>My chief boast is that I have adhered closely to my original,<br/>convinced that every departure from him would be punished with the<br/>forfeiture of some grace or beauty for which I could substitute no<br/>equivalent. The epithets that would consent to an English form I<br/>have preserved as epithets; others that would not, I have melted<br/>into the context. There are none, I believe, which I have not<br/>translated in one way or other, though the reader will not find<br/>them repeated so often as most of them are in Homer, for a reason<br/>that need not be mentioned.<br/><br/>Few persons of any consideration are introduced either in the<br/>Iliad or Odyssey by their own name only, but their patronymic is<br/>given also. To this ceremonial I have generally attended, because<br/>it is a circumstance of my author's manner.<br/><br/>Homer never allots less than a whole line to the introduction of<br/>a speaker. No, not even when the speech itself is no longer than<br/>the line that leads it. A practice to which, since he never departs<br/>from it, he must have been determined by some cogent reason. He<br/>probably deemed it a formality necessary to the majesty of his<br/>narration. In this article, therefore, I have scrupulously adhered<br/>to my pattern, considering these introductory lines as heralds in a<br/>procession; important persons, because employed to usher in persons<br/>more important than themselves.<br/><br/>It has been my point every where to be as little verbose as<br/>possible, though; at the same time, my constant determination not<br/>to sacrifice my author's full meaning to an affected brevity.<br/><br/>In the affair of style, I have endeavored neither to creep nor<br/>to bluster, for no author is so likely to betray his translator<br/>into both these faults, as Homer, though himself never guilty of<br/>either. I have cautiously avoided all terms of new invention, with<br/>an abundance of which, persons of more ingenuity than judgment have<br/>not enriched our language, but incumbered it. I have also every<br/>where used an unabbreviated fullness of phrase as most suited to<br/>the nature of the work, and, above all, have studied perspicuity,<br/>not only because verse is good for little that wants it, but<br/>because Homer is the most perspicuous of all poets.<br/><br/>
