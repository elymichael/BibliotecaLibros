As when a man<br/>On some projecting rock seated, with line<br/>And splendid hook draws forth a sea-fish huge,<br/>So him wide-gaping from his seat he drew<br/>At his spear-point, then shook him to the ground<br/>Prone on his face, where gasping he expired.<br/>At Eryalus, next, advancing swift<br/>He hurl'd a rock; full on the middle front<br/>He smote him, and within the ponderous casque<br/>His whole head open'd into equal halves.<br/>With deadliest night surrounded, prone he fell.<br/>Epaltes, Erymas, Amphoterus,<br/>Echius, Tlepolemus Damastor's son,<br/>Evippus, Ipheus, Pyres, Polymelus,<br/>All these he on the champain, corse on corse<br/>
