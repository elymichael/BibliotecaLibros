Of the superior virtue of my steeds.<br/>They are immortal; Neptune on my sire<br/>Peleus conferr'd them, and my sire on me.<br/>But neither I this contest share myself,<br/>Nor shall my steeds; for they would miss the force<br/>And guidance of a charioteer so kind<br/>As they have lost, who many a time hath cleansed<br/>Their manes with water of the crystal brook,<br/>And made them sleek, himself, with limpid oil.<br/>Him, therefore, mourning, motionless they stand<br/>With hair dishevell'd, streaming to the ground.<br/>But ye, whoever of the host profess<br/>Superior skill, and glory in your steeds<br/>And well-built chariots, for the strife prepare!<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>So spake Pelides, and the charioteers,<br/>For speed renown'd arose. Long ere the rest<br/>Eumelus, King of men, Admetus' son<br/>Arose, accomplish'd in equestrian arts.<br/>
