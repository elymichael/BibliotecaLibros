<br/>How long, my son! sorrowing and mourning here,<br/>Wilt thou consume thy soul, nor give one thought<br/>Either to food or love? Yet love is good,<br/>And woman grief's best cure; for length of days<br/>Is not thy doom, but, even now, thy death<br/>And ruthless destiny are on the wing.<br/>Mark me,—I come a lieger sent from Jove.<br/>The Gods, he saith, resent it, but himself<br/>More deeply than the rest, that thou detain'st<br/>Amid thy fleet, through fury of revenge,<br/>Unransom'd Hector. Be advised, accept<br/>Ransom, and to his friends resign the dead.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>To whom Achilles, swiftest of the swift.<br/>Come then the ransomer, and take him hence;<br/>If Jove himself command it,—be it so.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/>
