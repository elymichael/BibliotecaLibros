Wins here no thanks; one recompense awaits<br/>The sedentary and the most alert,<br/>The brave and base in equal honor stand,<br/>And drones and heroes fall unwept alike.<br/>I after all my labors, who exposed<br/>My life continual in the field, have earn'd<br/>No very sumptuous prize. As the poor bird<br/>Gives to her unfledged brood a morsel gain'd<br/>After long search, though wanting it herself,<br/>So I have worn out many sleepless nights,<br/>And waded deep through many a bloody day<br/>In battle for their wives.&#160;I have destroy'd<br/>Twelve cities with my fleet, and twelve, save one,<br/>On foot contending in the fields of Troy.<br/>From all these cities, precious spoils I took<br/>Abundant, and to Agamemnon's hand<br/>Gave all the treasure. He within his ships<br/>Abode the while, and having all received,<br/>Little distributed, and much retained;<br/>He gave, however, to the Kings and Chiefs<br/>A portion, and they keep it. Me alone<br/>
