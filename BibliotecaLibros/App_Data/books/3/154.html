Jove's daughter, reconciled to his embrace.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>But Menelaüs like a lion ranged<br/>The multitude, inquiring far and near<br/>For Paris lost. Yet neither Trojan him<br/>Nor friend of Troy could show, whom, else, through love<br/>None had conceal'd, for him as death itself<br/>All hated, but his going none had seen.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Amidst them all then spake the King of men.<br/>Trojans, and Dardans, and allies of Troy!<br/>The warlike Menelaüs hath prevailed,<br/>As is most plain. Now therefore bring ye forth<br/>Helen with all her treasures, also bring<br/>Such large amercement as is meet, a sum<br/>To be remember'd in all future times.<br/><br/>
