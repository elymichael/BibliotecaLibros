Twice twenty ships awaited their command.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Guneus from Cyphus twenty and two ships<br/>Led forth; the Enienes him obey'd,<br/>And the robust Perœbi, warriors bold,<br/>And dwellers on Dodona's wintry brow.<br/>To these were join'd who till the pleasant fields<br/>Where Titaresius winds; the gentle flood<br/>Pours into Peneus all his limpid stores,<br/>But with the silver-eddied Peneus flows<br/>Unmixt as oil;&#160;for Stygian is his stream,<br/>And Styx is the inviolable oath.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Last with his forty ships, Tenthredon's son,<br/>The active Prothoüs came. From the green banks<br/>Of Peneus his Magnesians far and near<br/>He gather'd, and from Pelion forest-crown'd.<br/>
