That shield gore-tainted Mars with fury smote.<br/>But she, retiring, with strong grasp upheaved<br/>A rugged stone, black, ponderous, from the plain,<br/>A land-mark fixt by men of ancient times,<br/>Which hurling at the neck of stormy Mars<br/>She smote him. Down he fell. Seven acres, stretch'd,<br/>He overspread, his ringlets in the dust<br/>Polluted lay, and dreadful rang his arms.<br/>The Goddess laugh'd, and thus in accents wing'd<br/>With exultation, as he lay, exclaim'd.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Fool! Art thou still to learn how far my force<br/>Surpasses thine, and darest thou cope with me?<br/>Now feel the furies of thy mother's ire<br/>Who hates thee for thy treachery to the Greeks,<br/>And for thy succor given to faithless Troy.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>
