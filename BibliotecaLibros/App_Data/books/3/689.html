The steel-charged&#160;arrow, and he dropp'd his bow.<br/>Then shuddering, to his brother thus he spake.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Ah! it is evident. Some Power divine<br/>Makes fruitless all our efforts, who hath struck<br/>My bow out of my hand, and snapt the cord<br/>With which I strung it new at dawn of day,<br/>That it might bear the bound of many a shaft.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>To whom the towering son of Telamon.<br/>Leave then thy bow, and let thine arrows rest,<br/>Which, envious of the Greeks, some God confounds,<br/>That thou may'st fight with spear and buckler arm'd,<br/>And animate the rest. Such be our deeds<br/>That, should they conquer us, our foes may find<br/>Our ships, at least a prize not lightly won.<br/><br/>
