Such prayer they made, and Pallas heard well pleased.<br/>Their orisons ended to the daughter dread<br/>Of mighty Jove, lion-like they advanced<br/>Through shades of night, through carnage, arms and blood.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Nor Hector to his gallant host indulged<br/>Sleep, but convened the leaders; leader none<br/>Or senator of all his host he left<br/>Unsummon'd, and his purpose thus promulged.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Where is the warrior who for rich reward,<br/>Such as shall well suffice him, will the task<br/>Adventurous, which I propose, perform?<br/>A chariot with two steeds of proudest height,<br/>Surpassing all in the whole fleet of Greece<br/>Shall be his portion, with immortal praise,<br/>Who shall the well-appointed ships approach<br/>
