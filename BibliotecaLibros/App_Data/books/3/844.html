Achilles stood, deploring loud his friend,<br/>And Jove his spouse and sister thus bespake.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>So then, Imperial Juno! not in vain<br/>Thou hast the swift Achilles sought to rouse<br/>Again to battle; the Achaians, sure,<br/>Are thy own children, thou hast borne them all.<br/><br/>To whom the awful Goddess ample-eyed.<br/>What word hath pass'd thy lips, Jove, most severe?<br/>A man, though mortal merely, and to me<br/>Inferior in device, might have achieved<br/>That labor easily. Can I who boast<br/>Myself the chief of Goddesses, and such<br/>Not by birth only, but as thine espoused,<br/>Who art thyself sovereign of all the Gods,<br/>Can I with anger burn against the house<br/>Of Priam, and want means of just revenge?<br/><br/>
