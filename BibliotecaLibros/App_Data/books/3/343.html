Into Achaia's host. They at the sight<br/>Astonish'd stood; fear whiten'd every cheek.<br/>Idomeneus dared not himself abide<br/>That shock, nor Agamemnon stood, nor stood<br/>The heroes Ajax, ministers of Mars.<br/>Gerenian Nestor, guardian of the Greeks,<br/>Alone fled not, nor he by choice remain'd,<br/>But by his steed retarded, which the mate<br/>Of beauteous Helen, Paris, with a shaft<br/>Had stricken where the forelock grows, a part<br/>Of all most mortal. Tortured by the wound<br/>Erect he rose, the arrow in his brain,<br/>And writhing furious, scared his fellow-steeds.<br/>Meantime, while, strenuous, with his falchion's edge<br/>The hoary warrior stood slashing the reins,<br/>Through multitudes of fierce pursuers borne<br/>On rapid wheels, the dauntless charioteer<br/>Approach'd him, Hector. Then, past hope, had died<br/>The ancient King, but Diomede discern'd<br/>His peril imminent, and with a voice<br/>Like thunder, called Ulysses to his aid.<br/>
