Chief leader of Pœnia's host spear-arm'd;<br/>This day hath also the eleventh risen<br/>Since I at Troy arrived. For my descent,<br/>It is from Axius river wide-diffused,<br/>From Axius, fairest stream that waters earth,<br/>Sire of bold Pelegon whom men report<br/>My sire. Let this suffice. Now fight, Achilles!<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>So spake he threatening, and Achilles raised<br/>Dauntless the Pelian ash. At once two spears<br/>The hero bold, Asteropæus threw,<br/>With both hands apt for battle. One his shield<br/>Struck but pierced not, impeded by the gold,<br/>Gift of a God; the other as it flew<br/>Grazed at his right elbow; sprang the sable blood;<br/>But, overflying him, the spear in earth<br/>Stood planted deep, still hungering for the prey.<br/>Then, full at the Pœonian Peleus' son<br/>Hurl'd forth his weapon with unsparing force<br/>
