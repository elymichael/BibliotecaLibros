ARGUMENT OF THE TWENTY-FIRST BOOK.

Achilles having separated the Trojans, and driven one part of
them to the city and the other into the Scamander, takes twelve
young men alive, his intended victims to the manes of Patroclus.
The river overflowing his banks with purpose to overwhelm him, is
opposed by Vulcan, and gladly relinquishes the attempt. The battle
of the gods ensues. Apollo, in the form of Agenor, decoys Achilles
from the town, which in the mean time the Trojans enter and shut
the gates against him.

His stream vortiginous from Jove derived,
There, separating Ilium's host, he drove
Part o'er the plain to Troy in the same road
By which the Grecians had so lately fled
The fury of illustrious Hector's arm.
That way they fled pouring themselves along
