If from thy Goddess-mother thou have aught<br/>Received, and with authority of Jove,<br/>Me send at least, me quickly, and with me<br/>The Myrmidons. A dawn of cheerful hope<br/>Shall thence, it may be, on the Greeks arise.<br/>Grant me thine armor also, that the foe<br/>Thyself supposing present, may abstain<br/>From battle, and the weary Greeks enjoy<br/>Short respite; it is all that war allows.<br/>We, fresh and vigorous, by our shouts alone<br/>May easily repulse an army spent<br/>With labor from the camp, and from the fleet,<br/><br/>Such suit he made, alas! all unforewarn'd<br/>That his own death should be the bitter fruit,<br/>And thus Achilles, sorrowful, replied.<br/><br/>Patroclus, noble friend! what hast thou spoken?<br/>Me neither prophesy that I have heard<br/>Holds in suspense, nor aught that I have learn'd<br/>From Thetis with authority of Jove!<br/>
