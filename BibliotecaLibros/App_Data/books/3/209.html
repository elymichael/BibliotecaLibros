Ã†neas him discern'd scattering the ranks,<br/>And through the battle and the clash of spears<br/>Went seeking godlike Pandarus; ere long<br/>Finding Lycaon's martial son renown'd,<br/>He stood before him, and him thus address'd.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Thy bow, thy feather'd shafts, and glorious name<br/>Where are they, Pandarus? whom none of Troy<br/>Could equal, whom of Lycia, none excel.<br/>Come. Lift thine hands to Jove, and at yon Chief<br/>Dispatch an arrow, who afflicts the host<br/>Of Ilium thus, conquering where'er he flies,<br/>And who hath slaughter'd numerous brave in arms,<br/>But him some Deity I rather deem<br/>Avenging on us his neglected rites,<br/>And who can stand before an angry God?<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>
