Through the Dardanian gates; to all he kneel'd<br/>In turn, then roll'd himself in dust, and each<br/>By name solicited to give him way.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Stand off, my fellow mourners! I would pass<br/>The gates, would seek, alone, the Grecian fleet.<br/>I go to supplicate the bloody man,<br/>Yon ravager; he may respect, perchance,<br/>My years, may feel some pity of my age;<br/>For, such as I am, his own father is,<br/>Peleus, who rear'd him for a curse to Troy,<br/>But chiefly rear'd him to myself a curse,<br/>So numerous have my sons in prime of youth<br/>Fall'n by his hand, all whom I less deplore<br/>(Though mourning all) than one; my agonies<br/>For Hector soon shall send me to the shades.<br/>Oh had he but within these arms expired,<br/>The hapless Queen who bore him, and myself<br/>Had wept him, then, till sorrow could no more!<br/>
