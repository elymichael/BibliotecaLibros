Thus he the Greeks exhorted. Opposite,
Meantime, illustrious Hector to his host
Vociferated, his design to oppose
Achilles publishing in every ear.

Fear not, ye valiant men of Troy! fear not
The son of Peleus. In a war of words
I could, myself, cope even with the Gods;
But not with spears; there they excel us all.
Nor shall Achilles full performance give
To all his vaunts, but, if he some fulfil,
Shall others leave mutilate in the midst.
I will encounter him, though his hands be fire,
Though fire his hands, and his heart hammer'd steel.

&#160;

So spake he them exhorting. At his word
Uprose the Trojan spears, thick intermixt
The battle join'd, and clamor loud began.
