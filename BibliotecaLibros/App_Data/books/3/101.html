Looks toward Elis o'er the curling waves,<br/>Sent forth their powers with Meges at their head,<br/>Brave son of Phyleus, warrior dear to Jove.<br/>Phyleus in wrath, his father's house renounced,<br/>And to Dulichium wandering, there abode.<br/>Twice twenty ships had follow'd Meges forth.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Ulysses led the Cephallenians bold.<br/>From Ithaca, and from the lofty woods<br/>Of Neritus they came, and from the rocks<br/>Of rude Ã†gilipa. Crocylia these,<br/>And these Zacynthus own'd; nor yet a few<br/>From Samos, from Epirus join'd their aid,<br/>And from the opposite Ionian shore.<br/>Them, wise as Jove himself, Ulysses led<br/>In twelve fair ships, with crimson prows adorn'd.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>
