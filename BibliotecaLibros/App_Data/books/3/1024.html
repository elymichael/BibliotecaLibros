They heap'd the fuel quick, a lofty pile.<br/>But Peleus' son, on other thoughts intent,<br/>Retiring from the funeral pile, shore off<br/>His amber ringlets,&#160;whose exuberant growth<br/>Sacred to Sperchius he had kept unshorn,<br/>And looking o'er the gloomy deep, he said.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Sperchius! in vain Peleus my father vow'd<br/>That, hence returning to my native land,<br/>These ringlets shorn I should present to thee<br/>With a whole hecatomb, and should, beside,<br/>Rams offer fifty at thy fountain head<br/>In thy own field, at thy own fragrant shrine.<br/>So vow'd the hoary Chief, whose wishes thou<br/>Leavest unperform'd. Since, therefore, never more<br/>I see my native home, the hero these<br/>Patroclus takes down with him to the shades.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/>
