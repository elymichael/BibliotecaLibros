Sprang forth for furious combat well prepared,<br/>But room for fight found none, so thick a fence<br/>Of shields and ported spears fronted secure<br/>The phalanx guarding Men≈ìtiades.<br/>For Ajax ranging all the ranks, aloud<br/>Admonish'd them that no man yielding ground<br/>Should leave Patroclus, or advance before<br/>The rest, but all alike fight and stand fast.<br/>Such order gave huge Ajax; purple gore<br/>Drench'd all the ground; in slaughter'd heaps they fell<br/>Trojans and Trojan aids of dauntless hearts<br/>And Grecians; for not even they the fight<br/>Waged bloodless, though with far less cost of blood,<br/>Each mindful to avert his fellow's fate.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Thus burn'd the battle; neither hadst thou deem'd<br/>The sun himself in heaven unquench'd, or moon,<br/>Beneath a cope so dense of darkness strove<br/>Unceasing all the most renown'd in arms<br/>
