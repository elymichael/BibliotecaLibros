Well fitted to his gripe, his ponderous spear.<br/>Meantime the hero Menela√ºs made<br/>Like preparation, and his arms put on.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>When thus, from all the multitude apart,<br/>Both combatants had arm'd, with eyes that flash'd<br/>Defiance, to the middle space they strode,<br/>Trojans and Greeks between. Astonishment<br/>Seized all beholders. On the measured ground<br/>Full near they stood, each brandishing on high<br/>His massy spear, and each was fiery wroth.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>First, Alexander his long-shadow'd spear<br/>Sent forth, and on his smooth shield's surface struck<br/>The son of Atreus, but the brazen guard<br/>Pierced not, for at the disk, with blunted point<br/>Reflex, his ineffectual weapon stay'd.<br/>
