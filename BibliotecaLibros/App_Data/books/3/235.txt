Of brave Æneas, warring in the van,
Deicöon son of Pergasus, in Troy

Nor stayed the weapon there, but through his belt
His bowels enter'd, and with hideous clang
And outcry&#160;of his batter'd arms he fell.

Sons of Diocles, of a wealthy sire,
Whose house magnificent in Phæræ stood,
Orsilochus and Crethon. Their descent
From broad-stream'd Alpheus, Pylian flood, they drew.
