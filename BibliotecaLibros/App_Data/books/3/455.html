<p>
Of fiery sort, difficult to be ruled<br/>By force of mortal man, Achilles' self<br/>Except, whom an immortal mother bore.<br/>But tell me yet again; use no disguise;<br/>Where left'st thou, at thy coming forth, your Chief,<br/>The valiant Hector? where hath he disposed<br/>His armor battle-worn, and where his steeds?<br/>What other quar4ers of your host are watch'd?<br/>Where lodge the guard, and what intend ye next?<br/>Still to abide in prospect of the fleet?<br/>Or well-content that ye have thus reduced<br/>Achaia's host, will ye retire to Troy?<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>To whom this answer Dolon straight returned<br/>Son of Eumedes. With unfeigning truth<br/>Simply and plainly will I utter all.<br/>Hector, with all the Senatorial Chiefs,<br/>Beside the tomb of sacred Ilius sits<br/>Consulting, from the noisy camp remote.<br/>
