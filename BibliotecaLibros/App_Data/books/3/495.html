Are ever such. More terrible are mine,<br/>And whom they pierce, though slightly pierced, he dies.<br/>His wife her cheeks rends inconsolable,<br/>His babes are fatherless, his blood the glebe<br/>Incarnadines, and where he bleeds and rots<br/>More birds of prey than women haunt the place.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>He ended, and Ulysses, drawing nigh,<br/>Shelter'd Tydides; he behind the Chief<br/>Of Ithaca sat drawing forth the shaft,<br/>But pierced with agonizing pangs the while.<br/>Then, climbing to his chariot-seat, he bade<br/>Sthenelus hasten to the hollow ships,<br/>Heart-sick with pain. And now alone was seen<br/>Spear-famed Ulysses; not an Argive more<br/>Remain'd, so universal was the rout,<br/>And groaning, to his own great heart he said.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/>
