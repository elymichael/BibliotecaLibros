Promise me, reaping smooth this silver beard,<br/>To make me downy-cheek'd as in my youth;<br/>Such as when erst from Hellas beauty-famed<br/>I fled, escaping from my father's wrath<br/>Amyntor, son of Ormenus, who loved<br/>A beauteous concubine, and for her sake<br/>Despised his wife and persecuted me.<br/>My mother suppliant at my knees, with prayer<br/>Perpetual importuned me to embrace<br/>The damsel first, that she might loathe my sire.<br/>I did so; and my father soon possess'd<br/>With hot suspicion of the fact, let loose<br/>A storm of imprecation, in his rage<br/>Invoking all the Furies to forbid565<br/>That ever son of mine should press his knees.<br/>Tartarian Jove&#160;and dread Persephone<br/>Fulfill'd his curses; with my pointed spear<br/>I would have pierced his heart, but that my wrath<br/>Some Deity assuaged, suggesting oft<br/>What shame and obloquy I should incur,<br/>Known as a parricide through all the land.<br/>
