The warlike prince? Now learn how brave a Chief<br/>Thou hast defrauded of his blooming spouse.<br/>Thy lyre, thy locks, thy person, specious gifts<br/>Of partial Venus, will avail thee nought,<br/>Once mixt by Menelaus with the dust.<br/>But we are base ourselves, or long ago,<br/>For all thy numerous mischiefs, thou hadst slept<br/>Secure beneath a coverlet&#160;of stone.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Then godlike Alexander thus replied.<br/>Oh Hector, true in temper as the axe<br/>Which in the shipwright's hand the naval plank<br/>Divides resistless, doubling all his force,<br/>Such is thy dauntless spirit whose reproach<br/>Perforce I own, nor causeless nor unjust.<br/>Yet let the gracious gifts uncensured pass<br/>Of golden Venus; man may not reject<br/>The glorious bounty by the Gods bestow'd,<br/>Nor follows their beneficence our choice.<br/>
