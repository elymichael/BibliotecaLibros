Eluded, and the spear piercing the soil<br/>Behind him, shook to its superior end,<br/>Till, spent by slow degrees, its fury slept.<br/>And now, with hand to hilt, for closer war<br/>Both stood prepared, when through the multitude<br/>Advancing at their fellow-warrior's call,<br/>The Ajaces suddenly their combat fierce<br/>Prevented. Awed at once by their approach<br/>Hector retired, with whom Æneas went<br/>Also and godlike Chromius, leaving there<br/>Aretus with his vitals torn, whose arms,<br/>Fierce as the God of war Automedon<br/>Stripp'd off, and thus exulted o'er the slain.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>My soul some portion of her grief resigns<br/>Consoled, although by slaughter of a worse,<br/>For loss of valiant Menœtiades.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/>
