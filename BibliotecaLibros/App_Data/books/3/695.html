<br/>Are we thus slack? Can Melanippus view<br/>Unmoved a kinsman slain? Seest not the Greeks<br/>How busy there with Dolops and his arms?<br/>Come on. It is no time for distant war,<br/>But either our Achaian foes must bleed,<br/>Or Ilium taken, from her topmost height<br/>Must stoop, and all her citizens be slain.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>So saying he went, whose steps the godlike Chief<br/>Attended; and the Telamonian, next,<br/>Huge Ajax, animated thus the Greeks.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Oh friends, be men! Deep treasure in your hearts<br/>An honest shame, and, fighting bravely, fear<br/>Each to incur the censure of the rest.<br/>Of men so minded more survive than die,<br/>
