<br/>Hear all ye Gods! as ye have given to me,<br/>So also on my son excelling might<br/>Bestow, with chief authority in Troy.<br/>And be his record this, in time to come,<br/>When he returns from battle. Lo! how far<br/>The son excels the sire! May every foe<br/>Fall under him, and he come laden home<br/>With spoils blood-stain'd to his dear mother's joy.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>He said, and gave his infant to the arms<br/>Of his Andromache, who him received<br/>Into her fragrant bosom, bitter tears<br/>With sweet smiles mingling; he with pity moved<br/>That sight observed, soft touch'd her cheek, and said,<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Mourn not, my loved Andromache, for me<br/>
