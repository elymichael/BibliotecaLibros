With such persuasions occupied, they fought.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Then Hector seized the stern of a brave bark<br/>Well-built, sharp-keel'd, and of the swiftest sail,<br/>Which had to Troy Protesil√§us brought,<br/>But bore him never thence. For that same ship<br/>Contending, Greeks and Trojans hand to hand<br/>Dealt slaughter mutual. Javelins now no more<br/>Might serve them, or the arrow-starting bow,<br/>But close conflicting and of one mind all<br/>With bill and battle-axe, with ponderous swords,<br/>And with long lances double-edged they fought.<br/>Many a black-hilted falchion huge of haft<br/>Fell to the ground, some from the grasp, and some<br/>From shoulders of embattled warriors hewn,<br/>And pools of blood soak'd all the sable glebe.<br/>Hector that ship once grappled by the stern<br/>Left not, but griping fast her upper edge<br/>With both hands, to his Trojans call'd aloud.<br/>
