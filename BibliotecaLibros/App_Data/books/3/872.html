To whom, designing fraud, Juno replied.<br/>Thou wilt be found false, and this word of thine<br/>Shall want performance. But Olympian Jove!<br/>Swear now the inviolable oath, that he<br/>Who shall, this day, fall from between the feet<br/>Of woman, drawing his descent from thee,<br/>Shall rule all kingdoms bordering on his own.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>She said, and Jove, suspecting nought her wiles,<br/>The great oath swore, to his own grief and wrong.<br/>At once from the Olympian summit flew<br/>Juno, and to Achaian Argos borne,<br/>There sought the noble wife&#160;of Sthenelus,<br/>Offspring of Perseus. Pregnant with a son<br/>Six months, she now the seventh saw at hand,<br/>But him the Goddess premature produced,<br/>And check'd Alcmena's pangs already due.<br/>Then joyful to have so prevail'd, she bore<br/>Herself the tidings to Saturnian Jove.<br/>
