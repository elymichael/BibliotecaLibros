I hope that, fierce in combat though he be,<br/>We shall, at last, slay Hector, and return<br/>Crown'd with great glory to the fleet of Greece.<br/>No fear of his deliverance now remains,<br/>Not even should the King of radiant shafts,<br/>Apollo, toil in supplication, roll'd<br/>And roll'd again&#160;before the Thunderer's feet.<br/>But stand, recover breath; myself, the while,<br/>Shall urge him to oppose thee face to face.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>So Pallas spake, whom joyful he obey'd,<br/>And on his spear brass-pointed lean'd. But she,<br/>(Achilles left) to noble Hector pass'd,<br/>And in the form, and with the voice loud-toned<br/>Approaching of Deiphobus, his ear<br/>In accents, as of pity, thus address'd.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>
