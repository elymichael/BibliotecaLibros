Meantime arrived where they had slain the spy<br/>Of Hector, there Ulysses, dear to Jove,<br/>The coursers stay'd, and, leaping to the ground,<br/>The son of Tydeus in Ulysses' hands<br/>The arms of Dolon placed foul with his blood,<br/>Then vaulted light into his seat again.<br/>He lash'd the steeds, they, not unwilling, flew<br/>To the deep-bellied barks, as to their home.<br/>First Nestor heard the sound, and thus he said.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Friends! Counsellors! and leaders of the Greeks!<br/>False shall I speak, or true?â€”but speak I must.<br/>The echoing sound of hoofs alarms my ear.<br/>Oh, that Ulysses, and brave Diomede<br/>This moment might arrive drawn into camp<br/>By Trojan steeds! But, ah, the dread I feel!<br/>Lest some disaster have for ever quell'd<br/>In yon rude host those noblest of the Greeks.<br/><br/>
