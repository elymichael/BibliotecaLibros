Is it, because by ordinance of Jove<br/>Thou art a lioness to womankind,<br/>Killing them at thy pleasure? Ah beware—<br/>Far easier is it, on the mountain-heights<br/>To slay wild beasts and chase the roving hind,<br/>Than to conflict with mightier than ourselves.<br/>But, if thou wish a lesson on that theme,<br/>Approach—thou shalt be taught with good effect<br/>How far my force in combat passes thine.<br/><br/>She said, and with her left hand seizing both<br/>Diana's wrists, snatch'd suddenly the bow<br/>Suspended on her shoulder with the right,<br/>And, smiling, smote her with it on the ears.<br/>She, writhing oft and struggling, to the ground<br/>Shook forth her rapid shafts, then, weeping, fled<br/>As to her cavern in some hollow rock<br/>The dove, not destined to his talons, flies<br/>The hawk's pursuit, and left her arms behind.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/>
