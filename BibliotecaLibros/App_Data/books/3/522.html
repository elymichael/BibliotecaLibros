Wisely, and thou shalt find him apt to learn."<br/>So thee thy father taught, but, as it seems,<br/>In vain. Yet even now essay to move<br/>Warlike Achilles; if the Gods so please,<br/>Who knows but that thy reasons may prevail<br/>To rouse his valiant heart? men rarely scorn<br/>The earnest intercession of a friend.<br/>But if some prophecy alarm his fears,<br/>And from his Goddess mother he have aught<br/>Received, who may have learnt the same from Jove,<br/>Thee let him send at least, and order forth<br/>With thee the Myrmidons; a dawn of hope<br/>Shall thence, it may be, on our host arise.<br/>And let him send thee to the battle clad<br/>In his own radiant armor; Troy, deceived<br/>By such resemblance, shall abstain perchance<br/>From conflict, and the weary Greeks enjoy<br/>Short respite; it is all that war allows.<br/>Fresh as ye are, ye, by your shouts alone,<br/>May easily repulse an army spent<br/>With labor from the camp and from the fleet.<br/>
