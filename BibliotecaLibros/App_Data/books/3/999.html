And, stripping slain Patroclus, thought'st thee safe,<br/>Nor caredst for absent me. Fond dream and vain!<br/>I was not distant far; in yonder fleet<br/>He left one able to avenge his death,<br/>And he hath slain thee. Thee the dogs shall rend<br/>Dishonorably, and the fowls of air,<br/>But all Achaia's host shall him entomb.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>To whom the Trojan Chief languid replied.<br/>By thy own life, by theirs who gave thee birth,<br/>And by thy knees,&#160;oh let not Grecian dogs<br/>Rend and devour me, but in gold accept<br/>And brass a ransom at my father's hands,<br/>And at my mother's an illustrious price;<br/>Send home my body, grant me burial rites<br/>Among the daughters and the sons of Troy.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>
