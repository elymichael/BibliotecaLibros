But since the past is fled<br/>Irrevocable, howsoe'er distress'd,<br/>Renounce we now vain musings on the past,<br/>Content through sad necessity. I go<br/>In quest of noble Hector, who hath slain<br/>My loved Patroclus, and such death will take<br/>As Jove ordains me and the Powers of Heaven<br/>At their own season, send it when they may.<br/>For neither might the force of Hercules,<br/>
