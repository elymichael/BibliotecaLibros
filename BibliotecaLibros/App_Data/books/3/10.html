the<br/>).<br/>When this particle precedes a vowel, shall he melt it into the<br/>substantive, or leave the<br/>hiatus<br/>open? Both practices are<br/>offensive to a delicate ear. The particle absorbed occasions<br/>harshness, and the open vowel a vacuity equally inconvenient.<br/>Sometimes, therefore, to leave it open, and sometimes to ingraft it<br/>into its adjunct seems most advisable; this course Mr. Pope has<br/>taken, whose authority recommended it to me; though of the two<br/>evils I have most frequently chosen the elision as the least.<br/><br/>Compound epithets have obtained so long in the poetical language<br/>of our country, that I employed them without fear or scruple. To<br/>have abstained from them in a blank verse translation of Homer, who<br/>abounds with them, and from whom our poets probably first adopted<br/>them, would have been strange indeed. But though the genius of our<br/>language favors the formation of such words almost as much as that<br/>of the Greek, it happens sometimes, that a Grecian compound either<br/>cannot be rendered in English at all, or, at best, but awkwardly.<br/>For this reason, and because I found that some readers much<br/>disliked them, I have expunged many; retaining, according to my<br/>best judgment, the most eligible only, and making less frequent the<br/>repetitions even of these.<br/><br/>I know not that I can add any thing material on the subject of<br/>this last revisal, unless it be proper to give the reason why the<br/>Iliad, though greatly altered, has undergone much fewer alterations<br/>than the Odyssey. The true reason I believe is this. The Iliad<br/>demanded my utmost possible exertions; it seemed to meet me like an<br/>ascent almost perpendicular, which could not be surmounted at less<br/>cost than of all the labor that I could bestow on it. The Odyssey<br/>on the contrary seemed to resemble an open and level country,<br/>through which I might travel at my ease. The latter, therefore,<br/>betrayed me into some negligence, which, though little conscious of<br/>it at the time, on an accurate search, I found had left many<br/>disagreeable effects behind it.<br/><br/>I now leave the work to its fate. Another may labor hereafter in<br/>an attempt of the same kind with more success; but more<br/>industriously, I believe, none ever will.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
