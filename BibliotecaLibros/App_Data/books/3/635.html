<br/>To whom majestic Juno thus replied.<br/>Ah, wherefore, Sleep! shouldst thou indulge a fear<br/>So groundless? Chase it from thy mind afar.<br/>Think'st thou the Thunderer as intent to serve<br/>The Trojans, and as jealous in their cause<br/>As erst for Hercules, his genuine son?<br/>Come then, and I will bless thee with a bride;<br/>One of the younger Graces shall be thine,<br/>Pasithea, day by day still thy desire.<br/><br/>She spake; Sleep heard delighted, and replied.<br/>By the inviolable Stygian flood<br/>Swear to me; lay thy right hand on the glebe<br/>All-teeming, lay thy other on the face<br/>Of the flat sea, that all the Immortal Powers<br/>Who compass Saturn in the nether realms<br/>May witness, that thou givest me for a bride<br/>The younger Grace whom thou hast named, divine<br/>Pasithea, day by day still my desire.<br/><br/>
