Plain I behold my former prayer perform'd,<br/>Myself exalted, and the Greeks abased.<br/>Now also grant me, Jove, this my desire!<br/>Here, in my fleet, I shall myself abide,<br/>But lo! with all these Myrmidons I send<br/>My friend to battle. Thunder-rolling Jove,<br/>Send glory with him, make his courage firm!<br/>That even Hector may himself be taught,<br/>If my companion have a valiant heart<br/>When he goes forth alone, or only then<br/>The noble frenzy feels that Mars inspires<br/>When I rush also to the glorious field.<br/>But when he shall have driven the battle-shout<br/>Once from the fleet, grant him with all his arms,<br/>None lost, himself unhurt, and my whole band<br/>Of dauntless warriors with him, safe return!<br/><br/>Such prayer Achilles offer'd, and his suit<br/>Jove hearing, part confirm'd, and part refused;<br/>To chase the dreadful battle from the fleet<br/>He gave him, but vouchsafed him no return.<br/>
