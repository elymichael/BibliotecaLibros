Brandish, by Chiron for his father hewn<br/>From Pelion's top for slaughter of the brave.<br/>His coursers, then, Automedon prepared<br/>And Alcimus, adjusting diligent<br/>The fair caparisons; they thrust the bits<br/>Into their mouths, and to the chariot seat<br/>Extended and made fast the reins behind.<br/>The splendid scourge commodious to the grasp<br/>Seizing, at once Automedon upsprang<br/>Into his place; behind him, arm'd complete<br/>Achilles mounted, as the orient sun<br/>All dazzling, and with awful tone his speech<br/>Directed to the coursers of his Sire.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Xanthus, and Balius of Podarges' blood<br/>Illustrious! see ye that, the battle done,<br/>Ye bring whom now ye bear back to the host<br/>Of the Achaians in far other sort,<br/>Nor leave him, as ye left Patroclus, dead.<br/>
