Opposed the force of Agamemnon's arm?<br/>Iphidamas, Antenor's valiant son,<br/>Of loftiest stature, who in fertile Thrace<br/>Mother of flocks was nourish'd, Cisseus him<br/>His grandsire, father of Theano praised<br/>For loveliest features, in his own abode<br/>Rear'd yet a child, and when at length he reach'd<br/>The measure of his glorious manhood firm<br/>Dismiss'd him not, but, to engage him more,<br/>Gave him his daughter. Wedded, he his bride<br/>As soon deserted, and with galleys twelve<br/>Following the rumor'd voyage of the Greeks,<br/>The same course steer'd; but at Percope moor'd,<br/>And marching thence, arrived on foot at Troy.<br/>He first opposed Atrides. They approach'd.<br/>The spear of Agamemnon wander'd wide;<br/>But him Iphidamas on his broad belt<br/>Beneath the corselet struck, and, bearing still<br/>On his spear-beam, enforced it; but ere yet<br/>He pierced the broider'd zone, his point, impress'd<br/>Against the silver, turn'd, obtuse as lead.<br/>
