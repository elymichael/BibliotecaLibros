He then, retiring slow, and turning oft,<br/>Forsook the body. As by dogs and swains<br/>With clamors loud and spears driven from the stalls<br/>A bearded lion goes, his noble heart<br/>Abhors retreat, and slow he quits the prey;<br/>So Menelaus with slow steps forsook<br/>Patroclus, and arrived in front, at length,<br/>Of his own phalanx, stood, with sharpen'd eyes<br/>Seeking vast Ajax, son of Telamon.<br/>Him leftward, soon, of all the field he mark'd<br/>Encouraging aloud his band, whose hearts<br/>With terrors irresistible himself<br/>Phœbus had fill'd. He ran, and at his side<br/>Standing, incontinent him thus bespake.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>My gallant Ajax, haste—come quickly—strive<br/>With me to rescue for Achilles' sake<br/>His friend, though bare, for Hector hath his arms.<br/><br/>
