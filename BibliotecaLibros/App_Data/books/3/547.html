March'd forward. As the lion mountain-bred,<br/>After long fast, by impulse of his heart<br/>Undaunted urged, seeks resolute the flock<br/>Even in the shelter of their guarded home;<br/>He finds, perchance, the shepherds arm'd with spears,<br/>And all their dogs awake, yet can not leave<br/>Untried the fence, but either leaps it light,<br/>And entering tears the prey, or in the attempt<br/>Pierced by some dexterous peasant, bleeds himself;<br/>So high his courage to the assault impell'd<br/>Godlike Sarpedon, and him fired with hope<br/>To break the barrier; when to Glaucus thus,<br/>Son of Hippolochus, his speech he turn'd.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Why, Glaucus, is the seat of honor ours,<br/>Why drink we brimming cups, and feast in state?<br/>Why gaze they all on us as we were Gods<br/>In Lycia, and why share we pleasant fields<br/>And spacious vineyards, where the Xanthus winds?<br/>
