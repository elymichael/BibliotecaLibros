Juno having borrowed the Cestus of Venus, first<br/>engages the assistance of Sleep, then hastens to Ida to inveigle<br/>Jove. She prevails. Jove sleeps; and Neptune takes that opportunity<br/>to succor the Grecians.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>Nor was that cry by Nestor unperceived<br/>Though drinking, who in words wing'd with surprise<br/>The son of Ã†sculapius thus address'd.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Divine Machaon! think what this may bode.<br/>
