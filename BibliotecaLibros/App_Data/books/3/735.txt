Promiscuous flung. Sarpedon, when he saw
Such havoc made of his uncinctured&#160;friends
By Men≈ìtiades, with sharp rebuke
His band of godlike Lycians loud address'd.

Shame on you, Lycians! whither would ye fly?
Now are ye swift indeed! I will oppose
Myself this conqueror, that I may learn
Who thus afflicts the Trojan host, of life
Bereaving numerous of their warriors bold.

He said, and with his arms leap'd to the ground.
On the other side, Patroclus at that sight
Sprang from his chariot. As two vultures clash
Bow-beak'd, crook-talon'd, on some lofty rock
Clamoring both, so they together rush'd
With clamors loud; whom when the son observed
Of wily Saturn, with compassion moved
His sister and his spouse he thus bespake.

Alas, he falls! my most beloved of men
