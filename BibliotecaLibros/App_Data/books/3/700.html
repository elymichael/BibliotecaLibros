Fell, as a wave by wintry blasts upheaved<br/>Falls ponderous on the ship; white clings the foam<br/>Around her, in her sail shrill howls the storm,<br/>And every seaman trembles at the view<br/>Of thousand deaths from which he scarce escapes,<br/>Such anguish rent the bosom of the Greeks.<br/>But he, as leaps a famish'd lion fell<br/>On beeves that graze some marshy meadow's breadth,<br/>A countless herd, tended by one unskill'd<br/>To cope with savage beasts in their defence,<br/>Beside the foremost kine or with the last<br/>He paces heedless, but the lion, borne<br/>Impetuous on the midmost, one devours<br/>And scatters all the rest,&#160;so fled the Greeks,<br/>Terrified from above, before the arm<br/>Of Hector, and before the frown of Jove.<br/>All fled, but of them all alone he slew<br/>The Mycen√¶an Periphetes, son<br/>Of Copreus custom'd messenger of King<br/>Eurystheus to the might of Hercules.<br/>From such a sire inglorious had arisen<br/>
