Ah that I could grow<br/>Young yet again, could feel again such force<br/>Athletic, as when in Buprasium erst<br/>The Epeans with sepulchral pomp entomb'd<br/>King Amarynceus, where his sons ordain'd<br/>Funereal games in honor of their sire!<br/>Epean none or even Pylian there<br/>Could cope with me, or yet Ætolian bold.<br/>Boxing, I vanquish'd Clytomedes, son<br/>Of Enops; wrestling, the Pleuronian Chief<br/>Ancæus; in the foot-race Iphiclus,<br/>Though a fleet runner; and I over-pitch'd<br/>Phyleus and Polydorus at the spear.<br/>The sons of Actor&#160;in the chariot-race<br/>Alone surpass'd me, being two for one,<br/>And jealous both lest I should also win<br/>That prize, for to the victor charioteer<br/>They had assign'd the noblest prize of all.<br/>They were twin-brothers, and one ruled the steeds,<br/>
