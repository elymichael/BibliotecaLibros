Seized fast; he wept, and suppliant them bespake.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Take me alive, and I will pay the price<br/>Of my redemption. I have gold at home,<br/>Brass also, and bright steel, and when report<br/>Of my captivity within your fleet<br/>Shall reach my father, treasures he will give<br/>Not to be told, for ransom of his son.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>To whom Ulysses politic replied.<br/>Take courage; entertain no thought of death.<br/>But haste! this tell me, and disclose the truth.<br/>Why thus toward the ships comest thou alone<br/>From yonder host, by night, while others sleep?<br/>To spoil some carcase? or from Hector sent<br/>A spy of all that passes in the fleet?<br/>Or by thy curiosity impell'd?<br/>
