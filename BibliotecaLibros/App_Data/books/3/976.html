<br/><br/><br/>Book XXII<br/><br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>ARGUMENT OF THE TWENTY-SECOND BOOK.<br/><br/>Achilles slays Hector.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>Thus they, throughout all Troy, like hunted fawns<br/>Dispersed, their trickling limbs at leisure cool'd,<br/>And, drinking, slaked their fiery thirst, reclined<br/>Against the battlements. Meantime, the Greeks<br/>Sloping their shields, approach'd the walls of Troy,<br/>And Hector, by his adverse fate ensnared,<br/>Still stood exposed before the Sc√¶an gate.<br/>
