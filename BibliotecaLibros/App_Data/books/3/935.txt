To Lemnos; there the son of Jason paid
His price, and, at great cost, EÃ«tion
The guest of Jason, thence redeeming him,
Sent him to fair Arisba;&#160;but he 'scaped
Thence also and regain'd his father's house.
Eleven days, at his return, he gave
To recreation joyous with his friends,
And on the twelfth his fate cast him again
Into Achilles' hands, who to the shades
Now doom'd him, howsoever loth to go.
Soon as Achilles swiftest of the swift
Him naked saw (for neither spear had he
Nor shield nor helmet, but, when he emerged,
Weary and faint had cast them all away)
Indignant to his mighty self he said.

&#160;

Gods! I behold a miracle! Ere long
The valiant Trojans whom my self have slain
Shall rise from Erebus, for he is here,
