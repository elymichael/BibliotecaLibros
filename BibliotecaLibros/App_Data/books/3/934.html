But he (his hands<br/>Wearied at length with slaughter) from the rest<br/>Twelve youths selected whom to death he doom'd,<br/>In vengeance for his loved Patroclus slain.<br/>Them stupified with dread like fawns he drove<br/>Forth from the river, manacling their hands<br/>Behind them fast with their own tunic-strings,<br/>And gave them to his warrior train in charge.<br/>Then, ardent still for blood, rushing again<br/>Toward the stream, Dardanian Priam's son<br/>He met, Lycaon, as he climb'd the bank.<br/>Him erst by night, in his own father's field<br/>Finding him, he had led captive away.<br/>Lycaon was employ'd cutting green shoots<br/>Of the wild-fig for chariot-rings, when lo!<br/>Terrible, unforeseen, Achilles came.<br/>He seized and sent him in a ship afar<br/>
