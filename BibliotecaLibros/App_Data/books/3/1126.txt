Hero! dismiss us now each to our bed,
That there at ease reclined, we may enjoy
Sweet sleep; for never have these eyelids closed
Since Hector fell and died, but without cease

But I have now both tasted food, and given
Wine to my lips, untasted till with thee.

With all dispatch two couches, purple rugs,
And arras, and warm mantles over all.

A couch for each, when feigning needful fear,
Achilles thus his speech to Priam turn'd.
