From steed to steed he vaults; they rapid fly;<br/>So Ajax o'er the decks of numerous ships<br/>Stalk'd striding large, and sent his voice to heaven.<br/>Thus, ever clamoring, he bade the Greeks<br/>Stand both for camp and fleet. Nor could himself<br/>Hector, contented, now, the battle wage<br/>Lost in the multitude of Trojans more,<br/>But as the tawny eagle on full wing<br/>Assails the feather'd nations, geese or cranes<br/>Or swans lithe-neck'd grazing the river's verge,<br/>So Hector at a galley sable-prow'd<br/>Darted; for, from behind, Jove urged him on<br/>With mighty hand, and his host after him.<br/>And now again the battle at the ships<br/>Grew furious; thou hadst deem'd them of a kind<br/>By toil untameable, so fierce they strove,<br/>And, striving, thus they fought. The Grecians judged<br/>Hope vain, and the whole host's destruction sure;<br/>But nought expected every Trojan less<br/>Than to consume the fleet with fire, and leave<br/>Achaia's heroes lifeless on the field.<br/>
