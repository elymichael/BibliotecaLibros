Unconquer'd daughter of Jove Ægis-arm'd!<br/>Ah foul dishonor! Is it thus at last<br/>That the Achaians on the billows borne,<br/>Shall seek again their country, leaving here,<br/>To be the vaunt of Ilium and her King,<br/>Helen of Argos, in whose cause the Greeks<br/>Have numerous perish'd from their home remote?<br/>Haste! Seek the mail-arm'd multitude, by force<br/>Detain them of thy soothing speech, ere yet<br/>All launch their oary barks into the flood.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>She spake, nor did Minerva not comply,<br/>But darting swift from the Olympian heights,<br/>Reach'd soon Achaia's fleet. There, she perceived<br/>Prudent as Jove himself, Ulysses; firm<br/>He stood; he touch'd not even with his hand<br/>His sable bark, for sorrow whelm'd his soul.<br/>The Athenæan Goddess azure-eyed<br/>Beside him stood, and thus the Chief bespake.<br/>
