<br/>&#160;<br/><br/>My Hector! reverence this, and pity me<br/>If ever, drawing forth this breast, thy griefs<br/>Of infancy I soothed, oh now, my son!<br/>Acknowledge it, and from within the walls<br/>Repulse this enemy; stand not abroad<br/>To cope with<br/>him<br/>, for he is savage-fierce,<br/>And should he slay thee, neither shall myself<br/>Who bore thee, nor thy noble spouse weep o'er<br/>Thy body, but, where we can never come,<br/>Dogs shall devour it in the fleet of Greece.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>So they with prayers importuned, and with tears<br/>Their son, but him sway'd not; unmoved he stood,<br/>Expecting vast Achilles now at hand.<br/>
