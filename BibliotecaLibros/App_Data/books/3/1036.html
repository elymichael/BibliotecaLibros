&#160;<br/><br/>Antilochus! Thou art, I know, beloved<br/>By Jove and Neptune both, from whom, though young<br/>Thou hast received knowledge of every art<br/>Equestrian, and hast little need to learn.<br/>Thou know'st already how to trim the goal<br/>With nicest skill, yet wondrous slow of foot<br/>Thy coursers are, whence evil may ensue.<br/>But though their steeds be swifter, I account<br/>Thee wise, at least, as they. Now is the time<br/>For counsel, furnish now thy mind with all<br/>Precaution, that the prize escape thee not.<br/>The feller of huge trees by skill prevails<br/>More than by strength; by skill the pilot guides<br/>His flying bark rock'd by tempestuous winds,<br/>And more by skill than speed the race is won.<br/>But he who in his chariot and his steeds<br/>Trusts only, wanders here and wanders there<br/>Unsteady, while his coursers loosely rein'd<br/>Roam wide the field; not so the charioteer<br/>
