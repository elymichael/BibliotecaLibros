Then, stung with grief, and with resentment fired<br/>Immeasurable, Menelaus rose<br/>To charge Antilochus. His herald gave<br/>The sceptre to his hand, and (silence bidden<br/>To all) the godlike hero thus began.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Antilochus! oh heretofore discreet!<br/>What hast thou done? Thou hast dishonor'd foul<br/>My skill, and wrong'd my coursers, throwing thine,<br/>Although inferior far, by fraud before them.<br/>Ye Chiefs and Senators of Argos' host!<br/>Impartial judge between us, lest, of these,<br/>Some say hereafter, Menelaus bore<br/>Antilochus by falsehood down, and led<br/>The mare away, because, although his steeds<br/>Were worse, his arm was mightier, and prevail'd.<br/>Yet holdâ€”myself will judge, and will to all<br/>Contentment give, for I will judge aright.<br/>Hither, Antilochus, illustrious youth!<br/>
