Chestnut throughout, save that his forehead bore<br/>A splendid blazon white, round as the moon.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>He stood erect, and to the Greeks he cried.<br/>Friends! Chiefs and senators of Argos' host!<br/>Discern I sole the steeds, or also ye?<br/>The horses, foremost now, to me appear<br/>Other than erst, and I descry at hand<br/>A different charioteer; the mares of late<br/>Victorious, somewhere distant in the race<br/>Are hurt; I plainly saw them at the first<br/>Turning the goal, but see them now no more;<br/>And yet with eyes inquisitive I range<br/>From side to side the whole broad plain of Troy.<br/>Either the charioteer hath slipp'd the reins,<br/>Or rounded not successfully the goal<br/>Through want of guidance. Thrown, as it should seem,<br/>Forth from his seat, he hath his chariot maim'd,<br/>And his ungovern'd steeds have roam'd away.<br/>
