Thou tell'st not, or thy words come not to pass.<br/>And now among the Danaï thy dreams<br/>Divulging, thou pretend'st the Archer-God<br/>For his priest's sake, our enemy, because<br/>I scorn'd his offer'd ransom of the maid<br/>Chrysëis, more desirous far to bear<br/>Her to my home, for that she charms me more<br/>Than Clytemnestra, my own first espoused,<br/>With whom, in disposition, feature, form,<br/>Accomplishments, she may be well compared.<br/>Yet, being such, I will return her hence<br/>If that she go be best. Perish myself—<br/>But let the people of my charge be saved<br/>Prepare ye, therefore, a reward for me,<br/>And seek it instant. It were much unmeet<br/>That I alone of all the Argive host<br/>Should want due recompense, whose former prize<br/>Is elsewhere destined, as ye all perceive.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>
