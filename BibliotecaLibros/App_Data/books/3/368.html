<br/>Juno and Pallas, wherefore sit ye sad?<br/>Not through fatigue by glorious fight incurr'd<br/>And slaughter of the Trojans whom ye hate.<br/>Mark now the difference. Not the Gods combined<br/>Should have constrain'd<br/>me<br/>back, till all my force,<br/>Superior as it is, had fail'd, and all<br/>My fortitude. But ye, ere ye beheld<br/>The wonders of the field, trembling retired.<br/>And ye did wellâ€”Hear what had else befallen.<br/>My bolts had found you both, and ye had reach'd,<br/>In your own chariot borne, the Olympian height,<br/>Seat of the blest Immortals, never more.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>He ended; Juno and Minerva heard<br/>Low murmuring deep disgust, and side by side<br/>Devising sat calamity to Troy.<br/>
