<br/><br/><br/>Book VII<br/><br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>ARGUMENT OF THE SEVENTH BOOK.<br/><br/>Ajax and Hector engage in single combat. The Grecians fortify<br/>their camp.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>So saying, illustrious Hector through the gates<br/>To battle rush'd, with Paris at his side,<br/>And both were bent on deeds of high renown.<br/>As when the Gods vouchsafe propitious gales<br/>To longing mariners, who with smooth oars<br/>Threshing the waves have all their strength consumed,<br/>So them the longing Trojans glad received.<br/>
