<br/>First Telamonian Ajax,&#160;bulwark firm<br/>Of the Achaians, broke the Trojan ranks,<br/>And kindled for the Greeks a gleam of hope,<br/>Slaying the bravest of the Thracian band,<br/>Huge Acamas, Eusorus' son; him first<br/>Full on the shaggy crest he smote, and urged<br/>The spear into his forehead; through his skull<br/>The bright point pass'd, and darkness veil'd his eyes.<br/>But Diomede, heroic Chief, the son<br/>Of Teuthras slew, Axylus.&#160;Rich was he,<br/>And in Arisba (where he dwelt beside<br/>The public road, and at his open door<br/>Made welcome all) respected and beloved.<br/>But of his numerous guests none interposed<br/>To avert his woful doom; nor him alone<br/>He slew, but with him also to the shades<br/>Calesius sent, his friend and charioteer.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>
