Self-praise, the Gods do know, is little worth.<br/>But neither lion may in pride compare<br/>Nor panther, nor the savage boar whose heart's<br/>High temper flashes in his eyes, with these<br/>The spear accomplish'd youths of Panthus' house.<br/>Yet Hyperenor of equestrian fame<br/>Lived not his lusty manhood to enjoy,<br/>Who scoffingly defied my force in arms,<br/>And call'd me most contemptible in fight<br/>Of all the Danaï. But him, I ween,<br/>His feet bore never hence to cheer at home<br/>His wife and parents with his glad return.<br/>So also shall thy courage fierce be tamed,<br/>If thou oppose me. I command thee, go—<br/>Mix with the multitude; withstand not me,<br/>Lest evil overtake thee! To be taught<br/>By sufferings only, is the part of fools.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>He said, but him sway'd not, who thus replied.<br/>
