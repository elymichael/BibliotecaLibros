On slain Patroclus, but at length his speech
To warlike Menelaus thus address'd.

&#160;

Ah, Menelaus, valiant friend! I hope
No longer, now, that even we shall 'scape
Ourselves from fight; nor fear I so the loss
Of dead Patroclus, who shall soon the dogs
Of Ilium, and the fowls sate with his flesh,
As for my life I tremble and for thine,
That cloud of battle, Hector, such a gloom
Sheds all around; death manifest impends.
Hasteâ€”call our best, if even they can hear.

&#160;

He spake, nor Menelaus not complied,
But call'd aloud on all the Chiefs of Greece.
