Both whom to glory he ordains, and whom<br/>He weakens and aids not; so now he leaves<br/>The Grecians, but propitious smiles on us.<br/>Therefore stand fast, and whosoever gall'd<br/>By arrow or by spear, diesâ€”let him die;<br/>It shall not shame him that he died to serve<br/>His country,&#160;but his children, wife and home,<br/>With all his heritage, shall be secure,<br/>Drive but the Grecians from the shores of Troy.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>So saying, he animated each. Meantime,<br/>Ajax his fellow-warriors thus address'd.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Shame on you all! Now, Grecians, either die,<br/>Or save at once your galley and yourselves.<br/>Hope ye, that should your ships become the prize<br/>Of warlike Hector, ye shall yet return<br/>
