Between the hosts, and rested in the soil.<br/>Long as the God unagitated held<br/>The dreadful disk, so long the vollied darts<br/>Made mutual slaughter, and the people fell;<br/>But when he look'd the Grecian charioteers<br/>Full in the face and shook it, raising high<br/>Himself the shout of battle, then he quell'd<br/>Their spirits, then he struck from every mind<br/>At once all memory of their might in arms.<br/>As when two lions in the still, dark night<br/>A herd of beeves scatter or numerous flock<br/>Suddenly, in the absence of the guard,<br/>So fled the heartless Greeks, for Phœbus sent<br/>Terrors among them, but renown conferr'd<br/>And triumph proud on Hector and his host.<br/>Then, in that foul disorder of the field,<br/>Man singled man. Arcesilaüs died<br/>By Hector's arm, and Stichius; one, a Chief<br/>Of the Bœotians brazen-mail'd, and one,<br/>Menestheus' faithful follower to the fight.<br/>Æneas Medon and Iäsus slew.<br/>
