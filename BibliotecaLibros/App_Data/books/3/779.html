But Hector found<br/>The armor apt; the God of war his soul<br/>With fury fill'd, he felt his limbs afresh<br/>Invigorated, and with loudest shouts<br/>Return'd to his illustrious allies.<br/>To them he seem'd, clad in those radiant arms,<br/>Himself Achilles; rank by rank he pass'd<br/>Through all the host, exhorting every Chief,<br/>Asteropæus, Mesthles, Phorcys, Medon,<br/>Thersilochus, Deisenor, augur Ennomus,<br/>Chromius, Hippothoüs; all these he roused<br/>To battle, and in accents wing'd began.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Hear me, ye myriads, neighbors and allies!<br/>For not through fond desire to fill the plain<br/>With multitudes, have I convened you here<br/>
