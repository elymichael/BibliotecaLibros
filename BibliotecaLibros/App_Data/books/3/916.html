&#160;<br/><br/>I pity brave Æneas, who shall soon,<br/>Slain by Achilles, see the realms below,<br/>By smooth suggestions of Apollo lured<br/>To danger, such as he can ne'er avert.<br/>But wherefore should the Chief, guiltless himself,<br/>Die for the fault of others? at no time<br/>His gifts have fail'd, grateful to all in heaven.<br/>Come, therefore, and let us from death ourselves<br/>Rescue him, lest if by Achilles' arm<br/>This hero perish, Jove himself be wroth;<br/>For he is destined to survive, lest all<br/>The house of Dardanus (whom Jove beyond<br/>All others loved, his sons of woman born)<br/>Fail with Æneas, and be found no more.<br/>Saturnian Jove hath hated now long time<br/>The family of Priam, and henceforth<br/>Æneas and his son, and his sons' sons,<br/>Shall sway the sceptre o'er the race of Troy.<br/><br/>
