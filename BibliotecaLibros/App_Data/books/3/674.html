<br/>Say, Hector, Priam's son! why sittest here<br/>Feeble and spiritless, and from thy host<br/>Apart? what new disaster hath befall'n?<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>To whom with difficulty thus replied<br/>The warlike Chief.â€”But tell me who art Thou,<br/>Divine inquirer! best of powers above!<br/>Know'st not that dauntless Ajax me his friends<br/>Slaughtering at yonder ships, hath with a stone<br/>Surceased from fight, smiting me on the breast?<br/>I thought to have beheld, this day, the dead<br/>In Ades, every breath so seem'd my last.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Then answer thus the Archer-God return'd.<br/>Courage this moment! such a helper Jove<br/>From Ida sends thee at thy side to war<br/>
