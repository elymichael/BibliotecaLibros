Beyond the lot of others. Him with shame<br/>The King of men hath overwhelm'd, by force<br/>Usurping his just meed; thou, therefore, Jove,<br/>Supreme in wisdom, honor him, and give<br/>Success to Troy, till all Achaia's sons<br/>Shall yield him honor more than he hath lost!<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>She spake, to whom the Thunderer nought replied,<br/>But silent sat long time. She, as her hand<br/>Had grown there, still importunate, his knees<br/>Clasp'd as at first, and thus her suit renew'd.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Or grant my prayer, and ratify the grant,<br/>Or send me hence (for thou hast none to fear)<br/>Plainly refused; that I may know and feel<br/>By how much I am least of all in heaven.<br/><br/>
