Why speaks Meriones, although in fight<br/>Approved, thus proudly? Nay, my gallant friend!<br/>The Trojans will not for reproach of ours<br/>Renounce the body. Blood must first be spilt.<br/>Tongues in debate, but hands in war decide;<br/>Deeds therefore now, not wordy vaunts, we need.<br/><br/>So saying he led the way, whom follow'd close<br/>Godlike Meriones. As from the depth<br/>Of some lone wood that clothes the mountain's side<br/>The fellers at their toil are heard remote,<br/>So, from the face of Ilium's ample plain<br/>Reverberated, was the din of brass<br/>And of tough targets heard by falchions huge<br/>Hard-smitten, and by spears of double-edge.<br/>None then, no, not the quickest to discern,<br/>Had known divine Sarpedon, from his head<br/>To his foot-sole with mingled blood and dust<br/>Polluted, and o'erwhelm'd with weapons. They<br/>Around the body swarm'd. As hovel-flies<br/>In spring-time buzz around the brimming pails<br/>
