<br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Discretion in a messenger is good<br/>At all times. But the cause that fires me thus,<br/>And with resentment my whole heart and mind<br/>Possesses, is the license that he claims<br/>To vex with provocation rude of speech<br/>Me his compeer, and by decree of Fate<br/>Illustrious as himself; yet, though incensed,<br/>And with just cause, I will not now persist.<br/>But hear—for it is treasured in my heart<br/>The threat that my lips utter. If he still<br/>Resolve to spare proud Ilium in despite<br/>Of me, of Pallas, Goddess of the spoils,<br/>Of Juno, Mercury, and the King of fire,<br/>And will not overturn her lofty towers,<br/>Nor grant immortal glory to the Greeks,<br/>Then tell him thus—hostility shall burn,<br/>And wrath between us never to be quench'd.<br/><br/>
