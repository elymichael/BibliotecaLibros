<br/>&#160;<br/><br/>These were the princes and the Chiefs of Greece.<br/>Say, Muse, who most in personal desert<br/>Excell'd, and whose were the most warlike steeds<br/>And of the noblest strain. Their hue, their age,<br/>Their height the same, swift as the winds of heaven<br/>And passing far all others, were the mares<br/>Which drew Eumelus; on Pierian hills<br/>The heavenly Archer of the silver bow,<br/>Apollo, bred them. But of men, the chief<br/>Was Telamonian Ajax, while wrath-bound<br/>Achilles lay; for he was worthier far,<br/>And more illustrious were the steeds which bore<br/>The noble son of Peleus; but revenge<br/>On Agamemnon leader of the host<br/>Was all his thought, while in his gallant ships<br/>Sharp-keel'd to cut the foaming flood, he lay.<br/>Meantime, along the margin of the deep<br/>His soldiers hurled the disk, or bent the bow.<br/>
