Immortal, thou may'st drink and be refresh'd.<br/>For wine is mighty to renew the strength<br/>Of weary man, and weary thou must be<br/>Thyself, thus long defending us and ours.<br/>To whom her son majestic thus replied.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>My mother, whom I reverence! cheering wine<br/>Bring none to me, lest I forget my might.<br/>I fear, beside, with unwash'd hands to pour<br/>Libation forth of sable wine to Jove,<br/>And dare on none account, thus blood-defiled,<br/>Approach the tempest-stirring God in prayer.<br/>Thou, therefore, gathering all our matrons, seek<br/>The fane of Pallas, huntress of the spoil,<br/>Bearing sweet incense; but from the attire<br/>Treasured within thy chamber, first select<br/>The amplest robe, most exquisitely wrought,<br/>And which thou prizest most—then spread the gift<br/>On Athenæan Pallas' lap divine.<br/>
