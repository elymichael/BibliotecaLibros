Fight for detested Helen under Troy.<br/>Nor even were<br/>he<br/>dead, whom, if he live,<br/>I rear in Scyros, my own darling son,<br/>My Neoptolemus of form divine.<br/>For still this hope I cherish'd in my breast<br/>Till now, that, of us two, myself alone<br/>Should fall at Ilium, and that thou, restored<br/>To Phthia, should'st have wafted o'er the waves<br/>My son from Scyros to his native home,<br/>That thou might'st show him all his heritage,<br/>My train of menials, and my fair abode.<br/>For either dead already I account<br/>Peleus, or doubt not that his residue<br/>Of miserable life shall soon be spent,<br/>Through stress of age and expectation sad<br/>That tidings of my death shall, next, arrive.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>
