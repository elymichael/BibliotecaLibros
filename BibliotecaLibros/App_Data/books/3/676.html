And gather'd fast his charioteers to battle.<br/>But as when hounds and hunters through the woods<br/>Rush in pursuit of stag or of wild goat,<br/>He, in some cave with tangled boughs o'erhung,<br/>Lies safe conceal'd, no destined prey of theirs,<br/>Till by their clamors roused, a lion grim<br/>Starts forth to meet them; then, the boldest fly;<br/>Such hot pursuit the Danaï, with swords<br/>And spears of double edge long time maintain'd.<br/>But seeing Hector in his ranks again<br/>Occupied, felt at once their courage fall'n.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Then, Thoas them, Andræmon's son, address'd,<br/>Foremost of the Ætolians, at the spear<br/>Skilful, in stationary combat bold,<br/>And when the sons of Greece held in dispute<br/>The prize of eloquence, excell'd by few.<br/>Prudent advising them, he thus began.<br/><br/>
