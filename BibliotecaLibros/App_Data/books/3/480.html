Dismounted; for no weapon raged as his.<br/>But now, at last, when he should soon have reach'd<br/>The lofty walls of Ilium, came the Sire<br/>Of Gods and men descending from the skies,<br/>And on the heights of Ida fountain-fed,<br/>Sat arm'd with thunders. Calling to his foot<br/>Swift Iris golden-pinion'd, thus he spake.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Iris! away. Thus speak in Hector's ears.<br/>While yet he shall the son of Atreus see<br/>Fierce warring in the van, and mowing down<br/>The Trojan ranks, so long let him abstain<br/>From battle, leaving to his host the task<br/>Of bloody contest furious with the Greeks.<br/>But soon as Atreus' son by spear or shaft<br/>Wounded shall climb his chariot, with such force<br/>I will endue Hector, that he shall slay<br/>Till he have reach'd the ships, and till, the sun<br/>Descending, sacred darkness cover all.<br/>
