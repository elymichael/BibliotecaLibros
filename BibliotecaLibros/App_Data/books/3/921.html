<br/>Thus he the Greeks exhorted. Opposite,<br/>Meantime, illustrious Hector to his host<br/>Vociferated, his design to oppose<br/>Achilles publishing in every ear.<br/><br/>Fear not, ye valiant men of Troy! fear not<br/>The son of Peleus. In a war of words<br/>I could, myself, cope even with the Gods;<br/>But not with spears; there they excel us all.<br/>Nor shall Achilles full performance give<br/>To all his vaunts, but, if he some fulfil,<br/>Shall others leave mutilate in the midst.<br/>I will encounter him, though his hands be fire,<br/>Though fire his hands, and his heart hammer'd steel.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>So spake he them exhorting. At his word<br/>Uprose the Trojan spears, thick intermixt<br/>The battle join'd, and clamor loud began.<br/>
