<br/>Sleep, over all, both Gods and men, supreme!<br/>If ever thou hast heard, hear also now<br/>My suit; I will be grateful evermore.<br/>Seal for me fast the radiant eyes of Jove<br/>In the instant of his gratified desire.<br/>Thy recompense shall be a throne of gold,<br/>Bright, incorruptible; my limping son,<br/>Vulcan, shall fashion it himself with art<br/>Laborious, and, beneath, shall place a stool<br/>For thy fair feet, at the convivial board.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Then answer thus the tranquil Sleep returned<br/>Great Saturn's daughter, awe-inspiring Queen!<br/>All other of the everlasting Gods<br/>I could with ease make slumber, even the streams<br/>Of Ocean, Sire of all.&#160;Not so the King<br/>The son of Saturn: him, unless himself<br/>Give me command, I dare not lull to rest,<br/>
