ARGUMENT OF THE FOURTEENTH BOOK.

Agamemnon and the other wounded Chiefs taking Nestor with them,
visit the battle. Juno having borrowed the Cestus of Venus, first
engages the assistance of Sleep, then hastens to Ida to inveigle
Jove. She prevails. Jove sleeps; and Neptune takes that opportunity
to succor the Grecians.

&#160;


Nor was that cry by Nestor unperceived
Though drinking, who in words wing'd with surprise
The son of Ã†sculapius thus address'd.

&#160;

Divine Machaon! think what this may bode.
