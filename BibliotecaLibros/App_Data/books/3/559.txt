ARGUMENT OF THE THIRTEENTH BOOK.

Neptune engages on the part of the Grecians. The battle
proceeds. Deiphobus advances to combat, but is repulsed by
Meriones, who losing his spear, repairs to his tent for another.
Teucer slays Imbrius, and Hector Amphimachus. Neptune, under the
similitude of Thoas, exhorts Idomeneus. Idomeneus having armed
himself in his tent, and going forth to battle, meets Meriones.
After discourse held with each other, Idomeneus accommodates
Meriones with a spear, and they proceed to battle. Idomeneus slays
Othryoneus, and Asius. Deiphobus assails Idomeneus, but, his spear
glancing over him, kills Hypsenor. Idomeneus slays Alcathoüs,
son-in-law of Anchises. Deiphobus and Idomeneus respectively summon
their friends to their assistance, and a contest ensues for the
body of Alcathoüs.

When Jove to Hector and his host had given
Such entrance to the fleet, to all the woes
And toils of unremitting battle there
He them abandon'd, and his glorious eyes
Averting, on the land look'd down remote
Of the horse-breeding Thracians, of the bold
Close-fighting Mysian race, and where abide
