Distinguished thus in Lycia, we are call'd<br/>To firmness here, and to encounter bold<br/>The burning battle, that our fair report<br/>Among the Lycians may be blazon'd thus—<br/>No dastards are the potentates who rule<br/>The bright-arm'd Lycians; on the fatted flock<br/>They banquet, and they drink the richest wines;<br/>But they are also valiant, and the fight<br/>Wage dauntless in the vanward of us all.<br/>Oh Glaucus, if escaping safe the death<br/>That threats us here, we also could escape<br/>Old age, and to ourselves secure a life<br/>Immortal, I would neither in the van<br/>Myself expose, nor would encourage thee<br/>To tempt the perils of the glorious field.<br/>But since a thousand messengers of fate<br/>Pursue us close, and man is born to die—<br/>E'en let us on; the prize of glory yield,<br/>If yield we must, or wrest it from the foe.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/>
