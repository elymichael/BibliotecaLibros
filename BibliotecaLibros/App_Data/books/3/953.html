Brother! oh let us with united force<br/>Check, if we may, this warrior; he shall else<br/>Soon lay the lofty towers of Priam low,<br/>Whose host appall'd, defend them now no more.<br/>Haste—succor me—thy channel fill with streams<br/>From all thy fountains; call thy torrents down;<br/>Lift high the waters; mingle trees and stones<br/>With uproar wild, that we may quell the force<br/>Of this dread Chief triumphant now, and fill'd<br/>With projects that might more beseem a God.<br/>But vain shall be his strength, his beauty nought<br/>Shall profit him or his resplendent arms,<br/>For I will bury them in slime and ooze,<br/>And I will overwhelm himself with soil,<br/>Sands heaping o'er him and around him sands<br/>Infinite, that no Greek shall find his bones<br/>For ever, in my bottom deep immersed.<br/>There shall his tomb be piled, nor other earth,<br/>At his last rites, his friends shall need for him.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/>
