<br/>Ye sons of Atreus, and ye Chiefs, the flower<br/>Of all Achaia! Priam and the Chiefs<br/>Of Ilium, bade me to your ear impart<br/>(If chance such embassy might please your ear)<br/>The mind of Paris, author of the war.<br/>The treasures which on board his ships he brought<br/>From Argos home (oh, had he perish'd first!)<br/>He yields them with addition from his own.<br/>Not so the consort of the glorious prince<br/>Brave Menelaus; her (although in Troy<br/>All counsel otherwise) he still detains.<br/>Thus too I have in charge. Are ye inclined<br/>That the dread sounding clamors of the field<br/>Be caused to cease till we shall burn the dead?<br/>Then will we clash again, 'till heaven at length<br/>Shall part us, and the doubtful strife decide.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>So spake Id√¶us, and all silent sat;<br/>
