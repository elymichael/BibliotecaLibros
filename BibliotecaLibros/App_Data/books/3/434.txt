To find them, since I gave them so in charge.

To whom the brave Gerenian Chief replied.
Him none will censure, or his will dispute,
Whom he shall waken and exhort to rise.

So saying, he bound his corselet to his breast,
His sandals fair to his unsullied feet,
And fastening by its clasps his purple cloak
Around him, double and of shaggy pile,
Seized, next, his sturdy spear headed with brass,
And issued first into the Grecian fleet.
There, Nestor, brave Gerenian, with a voice
Sonorous roused the godlike counsellor
From sleep, Ulysses; the alarm came o'er
His startled ear, forth from his tent he sprang
Sudden, and of their coming, quick, inquired.
