<br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Oh friends! hath no Achaian here such trust<br/>In his own prowess, as to venture forth<br/>Among yon haughty Trojans? He, perchance,<br/>Might on the borders of their host surprise<br/>Some wandering adversary, or might learn<br/>Their consultations, whether they propose<br/>Here to abide in prospect of the fleet,<br/>Or, satiate with success against the Greeks<br/>So signal, meditate retreat to Troy.<br/>These tidings gain'd, should he at last return<br/>Secure, his recompense will be renown<br/>Extensive as the heavens, and fair reward.<br/>From every leader of the fleet, his gift<br/>Shall be a sable&#160;ewe, and sucking lamb,<br/>Rare acquisition! and at every board<br/>And sumptuous banquet, he shall be a guest.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/>
