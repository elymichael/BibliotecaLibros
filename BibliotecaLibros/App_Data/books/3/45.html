First pierced, then flay'd them; the disjointed thighs<br/>They, next, invested with the double caul,<br/>Which with crude slices thin they overspread.<br/>The priest burned incense, and libation poured<br/>Large on the hissing brands, while, him beside,<br/>Busy with spit and prong, stood many a youth<br/>Trained to the task. The thighs with fire consumed,<br/>They gave to each his portion of the maw,<br/>Then slashed the remnant, pierced it with the spits,<br/>And managing with culinary skill<br/>The roast, withdrew it from the spits again.<br/>Their whole task thus accomplish'd, and the board<br/>Set forth, they feasted, and were all sufficed.<br/>When neither hunger more nor thirst remained<br/>Unsatisfied, boys crown'd the beakers high<br/>With wine delicious, and from right to left<br/>Distributing the cups, served every guest.<br/>Thenceforth the youths of the Achaian race<br/>To song propitiatory gave the day,<br/>Pæans&#160;to Phœbus, Archer of the skies,<br/>Chaunting melodious. Pleased, Apollo heard.<br/>
