<br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Since, then, ye bid me my own partner choose<br/>Free from constraint, how can I overlook<br/>Divine Ulysses, whose courageous heart<br/>With such peculiar cheerfulness endures<br/>Whatever toils, and whom Minerva loves?<br/>Let<br/>him<br/>attend me, and through fire itself<br/>We shall return; for none is wise as he.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>To him Ulysses, hardy Chief, replied.<br/>Tydides! neither praise me much, nor blame,<br/>For these are Grecians in whose ears thou speak'st,<br/>And know me well. But let us hence! the night<br/>Draws to a close; day comes apace; the stars<br/>Are far advanced; two portions have elapsed<br/>
