To ancient Nestor, whom he thus bespake.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Thou also, oh my father! this accept,<br/>Which in remembrance of the funeral rites<br/>Of my Patroclus, keep, for him thou seest<br/>Among the Greeks no more. Receive a prize,<br/>Thine by gratuity; for thou shalt wield<br/>The cestus, wrestle, at the spear contend,<br/>Or in the foot-race (fallen as thou art<br/>Into the wane of life) never again.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>He said, and placed it in his hands. He, glad,<br/>Receiving it, in accents wing'd replied.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>True, oh my son! is all which thou hast spoken.<br/>
