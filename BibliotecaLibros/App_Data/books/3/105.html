In thirty ships they sought the shores of Troy.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>The warriors of Pelasgian Argos next,<br/>Of Alus, and Alope, and who held<br/>Trechina, Phthia, and for women fair<br/>Distinguish'd, Hellas; known by various names<br/>Hellenes, Myrmidons, Achæans, them<br/>In fifty ships embark'd, Achilles ruled.<br/>But these were deaf to the hoarse-throated war,<br/>For there was none to draw their battle forth,<br/>And give them just array. Close in his ships<br/>Achilles, after loss of the bright-hair'd<br/>Brisëis, lay, resentful; her obtained<br/>Not without labor hard, and after sack<br/>Of Thebes and of Lyrnessus, where he slew<br/>Two mighty Chiefs, sons of Evenus both,<br/>Epistrophus and Mynes, her he mourn'd,<br/>And for her sake self-prison'd in his fleet<br/>And idle lay, though soon to rise again.<br/>
