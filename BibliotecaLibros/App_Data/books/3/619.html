For, spacious though it were, the shore alone<br/>That fleet sufficed not, incommoding much<br/>The people; wherefore they had ranged the ships<br/>Line above line gradual, and the bay<br/>Between both promontories, all was fill'd.<br/>They, therefore, curious to survey the fight,<br/>Came forth together, leaning on the spear,<br/>When Nestor met them; heavy were their hearts,<br/>And at the sight of him still more alarm'd,<br/>Whom royal Agamemnon thus bespake.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Neleian Nestor, glory of the Greeks!<br/>What moved thee to forsake yon bloody field,<br/>And urged thee hither? Cause I see of fear,<br/>Lest furious Hector even now his threat<br/>Among the Trojans publish'd, verify,<br/>That he would never enter Ilium more<br/>Till he had burn'd our fleet, and slain ourselves.<br/>So threaten'd Hector, and shall now perform.<br/>
