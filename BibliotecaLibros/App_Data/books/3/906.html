But should Achilles unapprized remain<br/>Of such advantage by a voice divine,<br/>When he shall meet some Deity in the field,<br/>Fear then will seize him, for celestial forms<br/>Unveil'd are terrible to mortal eyes.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>To whom replied the Shaker of the shores.<br/>Juno! thy hot impatience needs control;<br/>It ill befits thee. No desire I feel<br/>To force into contention with ourselves<br/>Gods, our inferiors. No. Let us, retired<br/>To yonder hill, distant from all resort,<br/>There sit, while these the battle wage alone.<br/>But if Apollo, or if Mars the fight<br/>Entering, begin, themselves, to interfere<br/>Against Achilles, then will we at once<br/>To battle also; and, I much misdeem,<br/>Or glad they shall be soon to mix again<br/>Among the Gods on the Olympian heights,<br/>
