Of Atreus, Agamemnon. Then the host<br/>Pray'd all, their hands uplifting, and with eyes<br/>To the wide heavens directed, many said-<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Eternal sire! choose Ajax, or the son<br/>Of Tydeus, or the King himself&#160;who sways<br/>The sceptre in Mycen√¶ wealth-renown'd!<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Such prayer the people made; then Nestor shook<br/>The helmet, and forth leaped, whose most they wished,<br/>The lot of Ajax. Throughout all the host<br/>To every chief and potentate of Greece,<br/>From right to left the herald bore the lot<br/>By all disown'd; but when at length he reach'd<br/>The inscriber of the lot, who cast it in,<br/>Illustrious Ajax, in his open palm<br/>The herald placed it, standing at his side.<br/>
