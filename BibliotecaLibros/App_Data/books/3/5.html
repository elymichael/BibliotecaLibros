<br/><br/><br/>Preface<br/><br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Whether a translation of Homer may be best executed in blank<br/>verse or in rhyme, is a question in the decision of which no man<br/>can find difficulty, who has ever duly considered what translation<br/>ought to be, or who is in any degree practically acquainted with<br/>those very different kinds of versification. I will venture to<br/>assert that a just translation of any ancient poet in rhyme, is<br/>impossible. No human ingenuity can be equal to the task of closing<br/>every couplet with sounds homotonous, expressing at the same time<br/>the full sense, and only the full sense of his original. The<br/>translator's ingenuity, indeed, in this case becomes itself a<br/>snare, and the readier he is at invention and expedient, the more<br/>likely he is to be betrayed into the widest departures from the<br/>guide whom he professes to follow. Hence it has happened, that<br/>although the public have long been in possession of an English<br/>Homer by a poet whose writings have done immortal honor to his<br/>country, the demand of a new one, and especially in blank verse,<br/>has been repeatedly and loudly made by some of the best judges and<br/>ablest writers of the present day.<br/><br/>I have no contest with my predecessor. None is supposable<br/>between performers on different instruments. Mr. Pope has<br/>surmounted all difficulties in his version of Homer that it was<br/>possible to surmount in rhyme. But he was fettered, and his fetters<br/>were his choice. Accustomed always to rhyme, he had formed to<br/>himself an ear which probably could not be much gratified by verse<br/>that wanted it, and determined to encounter even impossibilities,<br/>rather than abandon a mode of writing in which he had excelled<br/>every body, for the sake of another to which, unexercised in it as<br/>he was, he must have felt strong objections.<br/><br/>I number myself among the warmest admirers of Mr. Pope as an<br/>original writer, and I allow him all the merit he can justly claim<br/>as the translator of this chief of poets. He has given us the<br/>Tale of Troy divine<br/>in smooth verse, generally in correct<br/>and elegant language, and in diction often highly poetical. But his<br/>deviations are so many, occasioned chiefly by the cause already<br/>mentioned, that, much as he has done, and valuable as his work is<br/>on some accounts, it was yet in the humble province of a translator<br/>that I thought it possible even for me to fellow him with some<br/>advantage.<br/><br/>That he has sometimes altogether suppressed the sense of his<br/>author, and has not seldom intermingled his own ideas with it, is a<br/>remark which, on viii<br/>this occasion, nothing<br/>but necessity should have extorted from me. But we differ sometimes<br/>so widely in our matter, that unless this remark, invidious as it<br/>seems, be premised, I know not how to obviate a suspicion, on the<br/>one hand, of careless oversight, or of factitious embellishment on<br/>the other. On this head, therefore, the English reader is to be<br/>admonished, that the matter found in me, whether he like it or not,<br/>is found also in Homer, and that the matter not found in me, how<br/>much soever he may admire it, is found only in Mr. Pope. I have<br/>omitted nothing; I have invented nothing.<br/><br/>There is indisputably a wide difference between the case of an<br/>original writer in rhyme and a translator. In an original work the<br/>author is free; if the rhyme be of difficult attainment, and he<br/>cannot find it in one direction, he is at liberty to seek it in<br/>another; the matter that will not accommodate itself to his<br/>occasions he may discard, adopting such as will. But in a<br/>translation no such option is allowable; the sense of the author is<br/>required, and we do not surrender it willingly even to the plea of<br/>necessity. Fidelity is indeed of the very essence of translation,<br/>and the term itself implies it. For which reason, if we suppress<br/>the sense of our original, and force into its place our own, we may<br/>call our work an<br/>imitation<br/>, if we please, or perhaps a<br/>
