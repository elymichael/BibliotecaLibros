Her, therefore, Idas and Marpessa named<br/>Thenceforth Alcyone, because the fate<br/>Of sad Alcyone Marpessa shared,<br/>And wept like her, by Ph≈ìbus forced away.<br/>Thus Meleager, tortured with the pangs<br/>Of wrath indulged, with Cleopatra dwelt,<br/>Vex'd that his mother cursed him; for, with grief<br/>Frantic, his mother importuned the Gods<br/>To avenge her slaughter'd brothers&#160;on his head.<br/>Oft would she smite the earth, while on her knees<br/>Seated, she fill'd her bosom with her tears,<br/>And call'd on Pluto and dread Proserpine<br/>To slay her son; nor vain was that request,<br/>But by implacable Erynnis heard<br/>Roaming the shades of Erebus. Ere long<br/>The tumult and the deafening din of war<br/>Roar'd at the gates, and all the batter'd towers<br/>Resounded. Then the elders of the town<br/>Dispatch'd the high-priests of the Gods to plead<br/>With Meleager for his instant aid,<br/>With strong assurances of rich reward.<br/>
