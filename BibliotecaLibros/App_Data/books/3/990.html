Eluded, had not Ph≈ìbus, at his last,<br/>Last effort meeting him, his strength restored,<br/>And wing'd for flight his agile limbs anew?<br/>The son of Peleus, as he ran, his brows<br/>Shaking, forbad the people to dismiss<br/>A dart at Hector, lest a meaner hand<br/>Piercing him, should usurp the foremost praise.<br/>But when the fourth time to those rivulets.<br/>They came, then lifting high his golden scales,<br/>Two lots the everlasting Father placed<br/>Within them, for Achilles one, and one<br/>For Hector, balancing the doom of both.<br/>Grasping it in the midst, he raised the beam.<br/>Down went the fatal day of Hector, down<br/>To Ades, and Apollo left his side.<br/>Then blue-eyed Pallas hasting to the son<br/>Of Peleus, in wing'd accents him address'd.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Now, dear to Jove, Achilles famed in arms!<br/>
