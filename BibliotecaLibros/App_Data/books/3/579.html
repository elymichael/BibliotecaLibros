An ambush forth of all the bravest Greeks,<br/>(For in the ambush is distinguish'd best<br/>The courage; there the timorous and the bold<br/>Plainly appear; the dastard changes hue<br/>And shifts from place to place, nor can he calm<br/>The fears that shake his trembling limbs, but sits<br/>Low-crouching on his hams, while in his breast<br/>Quick palpitates his death-foreboding heart,<br/>And his teeth chatter; but the valiant man<br/>His posture shifts not; no excessive fears<br/>Feels he, but seated once in ambush, deems<br/>Time tedious till the bloody fight begin;)<br/>Even there, thy courage should no blame incur.<br/>For should'st thou, toiling in the fight, by spear<br/>Or falchion bleed, not on thy neck behind<br/>Would fall the weapon, or thy back annoy,<br/>But it would meet thy bowels or thy chest<br/>While thou didst rush into the clamorous van.<br/>But hasteâ€”we may not longer loiter here<br/>As children prating, lest some sharp rebuke<br/>Reward us. Enter quick, and from within<br/>
