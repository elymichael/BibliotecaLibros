Illustrious Hector first, then drags his corse<br/>In cruel triumph at his chariot-wheels<br/>Around Patroclus' tomb; but neither well<br/>He acts, nor honorably to himself,<br/>Who may, perchance, brave though he be, incur<br/>Our anger, while to gratify revenge<br/>He pours dishonor thus on senseless clay.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>To whom, incensed, Juno white-arm'd replied.<br/>And be it so; stand fast this word of thine,<br/>God of the silver bow! if ye account<br/>Only such honor to Achilles due<br/>As Hector claims; but Hector was by birth<br/>Mere man, and suckled at a woman's breast.<br/>Not such Achilles; him a Goddess bore,<br/>Whom I myself nourish'd, and on my lap<br/>Fondled, and in due time to Peleus gave<br/>In marriage, to a chief beloved in heaven<br/>Peculiarly; ye were yourselves, ye Gods!<br/>
