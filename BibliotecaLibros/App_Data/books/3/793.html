Than to permit the steed-famed host of Troy<br/>To drag Patroclus hence into the town,<br/>And make the glory of this conflict theirs.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Thus also of the dauntless Trojans spake<br/>A certain warrior. Oh, my friends! although<br/>The Fates ordain us, one and all, to die<br/>Around this body, stand! quit not the field.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>So spake the warrior prompting into act<br/>The courage of his friends, and such they strove<br/>On both sides; high into the vault of heaven<br/>The iron din pass'd through the desart air.<br/>Meantime the horses of Ã†acides<br/>From fight withdrawn, soon as they understood<br/>Their charioteer fallen in the dust beneath<br/>The arm of homicidal Hector, wept.<br/>
