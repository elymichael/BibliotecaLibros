Ah brother! thou art overtask'd, around<br/>The walls of Troy by swift Achilles driven;<br/>But stand, that we may chase him in his turn.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>To whom crest-tossing Hector huge replied.<br/>Deiphobus! of all my father's sons<br/>Brought forth by Hecuba, I ever loved<br/>Thee most, but more than ever love thee now,<br/>Who hast not fear'd, seeing me, for my sake<br/>To quit the town, where others rest content.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>To whom the Goddess, thus, cerulean-eyed.<br/>Brother! our parents with much earnest suit<br/>Clasping my knees, and all my friends implored me<br/>To stay in Troy, (such fear hath seized on all)<br/>But grief for thee prey'd on my inmost soul.<br/>Come—fight we bravely—spare we now our spears<br/>
