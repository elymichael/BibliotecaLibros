Echechleus, Actor's mighty son, enrich'd<br/>With countless dower, and led her to his home;<br/>While ancient Phylas, cherishing her boy<br/>With fond affection, reared him as his own.<br/>The third brave troop warlike Pisander led,<br/>Offspring of Maimalus; he far excell'd<br/>In spear-fight every Myrmidon, the friend<br/>Of Peleus' dauntless son alone except.<br/>The hoary Phœnix of equestrian fame<br/>The fourth band led to battle, and the fifth<br/>Laërceus' offspring, bold Alcimedon.<br/>Thus, all his bands beneath their proper Chiefs<br/>Marshall'd, Achilles gave them strict command—<br/><br/>Myrmidons! all that vengeance now inflict,<br/>Which in this fleet ye ceased not to denounce<br/>Against the Trojans while my wrath endured.<br/>Me censuring, ye have proclaim'd me oft<br/>Obdurate. Oh Achilles! ye have said,<br/>Thee not with milk thy mother but with bile<br/>Suckled, who hold'st thy people here in camp<br/>
