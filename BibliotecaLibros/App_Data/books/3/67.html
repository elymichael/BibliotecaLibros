With minds in tumult toss'd; all, save the few,<br/>Partners of his intent. Commotion shook<br/>The whole assembly, such as heaves the flood<br/>Of the Icarian Deep, when South and East<br/>Burst forth together from the clouds of Jove.<br/>And as when vehement the West-wind falls<br/>On standing corn mature, the loaded ears<br/>Innumerable bow before the gale,<br/>So was the council shaken. With a shout<br/>All flew toward the ships; uprais'd, the dust<br/>Stood o'er them; universal was the cry,<br/>"Now clear the passages, strike down the props,<br/>Set every vessel free, launch, and away!"<br/>Heaven rang with exclamation of the host<br/>All homeward bent, and launching glad the fleet.<br/>Then baffled Fate had the Achaians seen<br/>Returning premature, but Juno thus,<br/>With admonition quick to Pallas spake.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>
