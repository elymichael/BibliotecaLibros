Libation, praying him a safe return<br/>From hostile hands, since thou art urged to seek<br/>The Grecian camp, though not by my desire.<br/>Pray also to Id√¶an Jove cloud-girt,<br/>Who oversees all Ilium, that he send<br/>His messenger or ere thou go, the bird<br/>His favorite most, surpassing all in strength,<br/>At thy right hand; him seeing, thou shalt tend<br/>With better hope toward the fleet of Greece.<br/>But should loud-thundering Jove his lieger swift<br/>Withhold, from me far be it to advise<br/>This journey, howsoe'er thou wish to go.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>To whom the godlike Priam thus replied.<br/>This exhortation will I not refuse,<br/>O Queen! for, lifting to the Gods his hands<br/>In prayer for their compassion, none can err.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/>
