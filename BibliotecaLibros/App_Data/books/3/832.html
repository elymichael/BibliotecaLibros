To win him, purposing to lop his head,<br/>And to exhibit it impaled on high.<br/>Thou then arise, nor longer on the ground<br/>Lie stretch'd inactive; let the thought with shame<br/>Touch thee, of thy Patroclus made the sport<br/>Of Trojan dogs, whose corse, if it return<br/>Dishonored home, brings with it thy reproach.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>To whom Achilles matchless in the race.<br/>Iris divine! of all the Gods, who sent thee?<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Then, thus, the swift ambassadress of heaven.<br/>By Juno sent I come, consort of Jove.<br/>Nor knows Saturnian Jove high-throned, himself,<br/>My flight, nor any of the Immortal Powers,<br/>Tenants of the Olympian heights snow-crown'd.<br/><br/>
