&#160;<br/><br/>So saying, the Shaker of the shores forsook<br/>The Grecian host, and plunged into the deep,<br/>Miss'd by Achaia's heroes. Then, the cloud-Assembler<br/>God thus to Apollo spake.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Hence, my Apollo! to the Trojan Chief<br/>Hector; for earth-encircler Neptune, awed<br/>By fear of my displeasure imminent,<br/>Hath sought the sacred Deep. Else, all the Gods<br/>Who compass Saturn in the nether realms,<br/>Had even there our contest heard, I ween,<br/>And heard it loudly. But that he retreats<br/>Although at first incensed, shunning my wrath,<br/>Is salutary both for him and me,<br/>Whose difference else had not been healed with ease.<br/>Take thou my shaggy Ã†gis, and with force<br/>Smiting it, terrify the Chiefs of Greece.<br/>
