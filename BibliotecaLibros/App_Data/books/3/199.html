So shall we not provoke our father's ire.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>She said, and from the fight conducted forth<br/>The impetuous Deity, whom on the side<br/>She seated of Scamander deep-embank'd.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>And now the host of Troy to flight inclined<br/>Before the Grecians, and the Chiefs of Greece<br/>Each slew a warrior. Agamemnon first<br/>Gigantic Odius from his chariot hurl'd.<br/>Chief of the Halizonians. He to flight<br/>Turn'd foremost, when the monarch in his spine<br/>Between the shoulder-bones his spear infixt,<br/>And urged it through his breast. Sounding he fell,<br/>And loud his batter'd armor rang around.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/>
