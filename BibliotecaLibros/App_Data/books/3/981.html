Or falchion of some Greek hath laid me low.<br/>The very dogs fed at my table-side,<br/>My portal-guards, drinking their master's blood<br/>To drunkenness, shall wallow in my courts.<br/>Fair falls the warlike youth in battle slain,<br/>And when he lies torn by the pointed steel,<br/>His death becomes him well; he is secure,<br/>Though dead, from shame, whatever next befalls:<br/>But when the silver locks and silver beard<br/>Of an old man slain by the sword, from dogs<br/>Receive dishonor, of all ills that wait<br/>On miserable man, that sure is worst.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>So spake the ancient King, and his grey hairs<br/>Pluck'd with both hands, but Hector firm endured.<br/>On the other side all tears his mother stood,<br/>And lamentation; with one hand she bared,<br/>And with the other hand produced her breast,<br/>Then in wing'd accents, weeping, him bespake.<br/>
