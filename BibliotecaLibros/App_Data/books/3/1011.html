Ate marrow only, once, and fat of lambs,<br/>And when sleep took him, and his crying fit<br/>Had ceased, slept ever on the softest bed,<br/>Warm in his nurse's arms, fed to his fill<br/>With delicacies, and his heart at rest.<br/>But now, Astyanax (so named in Troy<br/>For thy sake, guardian of her gates and towers)<br/>His father lost, must many a pang endure.<br/>And as for thee, cast naked forth among<br/>Yon galleys, where no parent's eye of thine<br/>Shall find thee, when the dogs have torn thee once<br/>Till they are sated, worms shall eat thee next.<br/>Meantime, thy graceful raiment rich, prepared<br/>By our own maidens, in thy palace lies;<br/>But I will burn it, burn it all, because<br/>Useless to thee, who never, so adorn'd,<br/>Shalt slumber more; yet every eye in Troy<br/>Shall see, how glorious once was thy attire.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>
