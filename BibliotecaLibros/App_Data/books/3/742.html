To fight for slain Sarpedon; striding next<br/>With eager haste into the ranks of Troy,<br/>Renown'd Agenor and the son he call'd<br/>Of Panthus, brave Polydamas, with whom<br/>Æneas also, and approaching last<br/>To Hector brazen-mail'd him thus bespake.<br/><br/>Now, Hector! now, thou hast indeed resign'd<br/>All care of thy allies, who, for thy sake,<br/>Lost both to friends and country, on these plains<br/>Perish, unaided and unmiss'd by thee.<br/>Sarpedon breathless lies, who led to fight<br/>Our shielded bands, and from whose just control<br/>And courage Lycia drew her chief defence.<br/>Him brazen Mars hath by the spear subdued<br/>Of Menœtiades. But stand ye firm!<br/>Let indignation fire you, O my friends!<br/>Lest, stripping him of his resplendent arms,<br/>The Myrmidons with foul dishonor shame<br/>His body, through resentment of the deaths<br/>Of numerous Grecians slain by spears of ours.<br/>
