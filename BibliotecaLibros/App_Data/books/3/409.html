His only son, the son of his old age,<br/>Inheritor of all his large demesnes.<br/>He made me rich; placed under my control<br/>A populous realm, and on the skirts I dwelt<br/>Of Phthia, ruling the Dolopian race.<br/>Thee from my soul, thou semblance of the Gods,<br/>I loved, and all illustrious as thou art,<br/>Achilles! such I made thee. For with me,<br/>Me only, would'st thou forth to feast abroad,<br/>Nor would'st thou taste thy food at home, 'till first<br/>I placed thee on my knees, with my own hand<br/>Thy viands carved and fed thee, and the wine<br/>Held to thy lips; and many a time, in fits<br/>Of infant frowardness, the purple juice<br/>Rejecting thou hast deluged all my vest,<br/>And fill'd my bosom. Oh, I have endured<br/>Much, and have also much perform'd for thee,<br/>Thus purposing, that since the Gods vouchsaf'd<br/>No son to me, thyself shouldst be my son,<br/>Godlike Achilles! who shouldst screen perchance<br/>From a foul fate my else unshelter'd age.<br/>
