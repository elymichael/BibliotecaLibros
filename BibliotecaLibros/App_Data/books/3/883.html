Father! dire calamities, effects<br/>Of thy appointment, fall on human-kind.<br/>Never had Agamemnon in my breast<br/>Such anger kindled, never had he seized,<br/>Blinded by wrath, and torn my prize away,<br/>But that the slaughter of our numerous friends<br/>Which thence ensued, thou hadst, thyself, ordained.<br/>Now go, ye Grecians, eat, and then to battle.<br/><br/>
