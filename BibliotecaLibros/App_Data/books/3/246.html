Sightless, of all thought bereft,<br/>He sank, but soon revived, by breathing airs<br/>Refresh'd, that fann'd him gently from the North.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Meantime the Argives, although press'd alike<br/>By Mars himself and Hector brazen-arm'd,<br/>Neither to flight inclined, nor yet advanced<br/>To battle, but inform'd that Mars the fight<br/>Waged on the side of Ilium, slow retired.<br/><br/>
