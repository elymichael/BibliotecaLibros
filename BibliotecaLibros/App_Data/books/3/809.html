Sent forth by brave or base? Jove guides them all,<br/>While, ineffectual, ours fall to the ground.<br/>But haste, devise we of ourselves the means<br/>How likeliest we may bear Patroclus hence,<br/>And gladden, safe returning, all our friends,<br/>Who, hither looking anxious, hope have none<br/>That we shall longer check the unconquer'd force<br/>Of hero-slaughtering Hector, but expect<br/>To see him soon amid the fleet of Greece.<br/>Oh for some Grecian now to carry swift<br/>The tidings to Achilles' ear, untaught,<br/>As I conjecture, yet the doleful news<br/>Of his Patroclus slain! but no such Greek<br/>May I discern, such universal gloom<br/>Both men and steeds envelops all around.<br/>Father of heaven and earth! deliver thou<br/>Achaia's host from darkness; clear the skies;<br/>Give day; and (since thy sovereign will is such)<br/>Destruction with itâ€”but oh give us day!<br/><br/>&#160;<br/>
