So spake the son of Peleus; then arose<br/>Huge Telamonian Ajax, and upstood<br/>Ulysses also, in all wiles adept.<br/>Both girt around, into the midst they moved.<br/>With vigorous gripe each lock'd the other fast,<br/>Like rafters, standing, of some mansion built<br/>By a prime artist proof against all winds.<br/>Their backs, tugg'd vehemently, creak'd,&#160;the sweat<br/>Trickled, and on their flanks and shoulders, red<br/>The whelks arose; they bearing still in mind<br/>The tripod, ceased not struggling for the prize.<br/>Nor could Ulysses from his station move<br/>And cast down Ajax, nor could Ajax him<br/>Unsettle, fixt so firm Ulysses stood.<br/>But when, long time expectant, all the Greeks<br/>Grew weary, then, huge Ajax him bespake.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Laertes' noble son, for wiles renown'd!<br/>Lift, or be lifted, and let Jove decide.<br/>
