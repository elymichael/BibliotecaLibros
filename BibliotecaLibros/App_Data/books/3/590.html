Erewhile his bosom's faithful guard; shrill rang<br/>The shiver'd brass; sounding he fell; the beam<br/>Implanted in his palpitating heart<br/>Shook to its topmost point, but, its force spent,<br/>At last, quiescent, stood. Then loud exclaim'd<br/>Idomeneus, exulting in his fall.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>What thinks Deiphobus? seems it to thee<br/>Vain boaster, that, three warriors slain for one,<br/>We yield thee just amends? else, stand thyself<br/>Against me; learn the valor of a Chief<br/>The progeny of Jove; Jove first begat<br/>Crete's guardian, Minos, from which Minos sprang<br/>Deucalion, and from famed Deucalion, I;<br/>I, sovereign of the numerous race of Crete's<br/>Extensive isle, and whom my galleys brought<br/>To these your shores at last, that I might prove<br/>Thy curse, thy father's, and a curse to Troy.<br/><br/>
