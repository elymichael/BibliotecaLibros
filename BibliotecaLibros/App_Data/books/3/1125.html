<br/>So spake Achilles, and, upstarting, slew<br/>A sheep white-fleeced, which his attendants flay'd,<br/>And busily and with much skill their task<br/>Administ'ring, first scored the viands well,<br/>Then pierced them with the spits, and when the roast<br/>Was finish'd, drew them from the spits again.<br/>And now, Automedon dispensed around<br/>The polish'd board bread in neat baskets piled,<br/>Which done, Achilles portion'd out to each<br/>His share, and all assail'd the ready feast.<br/>But when nor hunger more nor thirst they felt,<br/>Dardanian Priam, wond'ring at his bulk<br/>And beauty (for he seem'd some God from heaven)<br/>Gazed on Achilles, while Achilles held<br/>Not less in admiration of his looks<br/>Benign, and of his gentle converse wise,<br/>Gazed on Dardanian Priam, and, at length<br/>(The eyes of each gratified to the full)<br/>The ancient King thus to Achilles spake.<br/><br/>
