Furnish'd with plenteous cheer, they feasted all<br/>Till all were satisfied; nor Ajax miss'd<br/>The conqueror's meed, to whom the hero-king<br/>Wide-ruling Agamemnon, gave the chine<br/>Perpetual,&#160;his distinguish'd portion due.<br/>The calls of hunger and of thirst at length<br/>Both well sufficed, thus, foremost of them all<br/>The ancient Nestor, whose advice had oft<br/>Proved salutary, prudent thus began.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Chiefs of Achaia, and thou, chief of all,<br/>Great Agamemnon! Many of our host<br/>Lie slain, whose blood sprinkles, in battle shed,<br/>The banks of smooth Scamander, and their souls<br/>Have journey'd down into the realms of death.<br/>To-morrow, therefore, let the battle pause<br/>As need requires, and at the peep of day<br/>With mules and oxen, wheel ye from all parts<br/>The dead, that we may burn them near the fleet.<br/>
