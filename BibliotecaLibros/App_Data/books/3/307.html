Shall me bereave, my armor is his prize,<br/>Which he shall hence into your fleet convey;<br/>Not so my body; that he shall resign<br/>For burial to the men and wives of Troy.<br/>But if Apollo make the glory mine,<br/>And he fall vanquish'd, him will I despoil,<br/>And hence conveying into sacred Troy<br/>His arms, will in the temple hang them high<br/>Of the bow-bender God, but I will send<br/>His body to the fleet, that him the Greeks95<br/>May grace with rights funereal. On the banks<br/>Of wide-spread Hellespont ye shall upraise<br/>His tomb, and as they cleave with oary barks<br/>The sable deep, posterity shall sayâ€”<br/>"It is a warrior's tomb; in ancient days<br/>The Hero died; him warlike Hector slew."<br/>So men shall speak hereafter, and my fame<br/>Who slew him, and my praise, shall never die.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>
