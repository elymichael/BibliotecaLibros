Retiring to his tent, displaced the lid<br/>Of a capacious chest magnificent<br/>By silver-footed Thetis stow'd on board<br/>His bark, and fill'd with tunics, mantles warm,<br/>And gorgeous arras; there he also kept<br/>Secure a goblet exquisitely wrought,<br/>Which never lip touched save his own, and whence<br/>He offer'd only to the Sire of all.<br/>That cup producing from the chest, he first<br/>With sulphur fumed it, then with water rinsed<br/>Pellucid of the running stream, and, last<br/>(His hands clean laved) he charged it high with wine.<br/>And now, advancing to his middle court,<br/>He pour'd libation, and with eyes to heaven<br/>Uplifted pray'd,&#160;of Jove not unobserved.<br/><br/>Pelasgian, Dodon√¶an Jove supreme,<br/>Dwelling remote, who on Dodona's heights<br/>Snow-clad reign'st Sovereign, by thy seers around<br/>Compass'd the Selli, prophets vow-constrain'd<br/>To unwash'd feet and slumbers on the ground!<br/>
