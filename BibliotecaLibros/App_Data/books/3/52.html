But now there seems a cause. Deeply I dread<br/>Lest Thetis, silver-footed daughter fair<br/>Of Ocean's hoary Sovereign, here arrived<br/>At early dawn to practise on thee, Jove!<br/>I noticed her a suitress at thy knees,<br/>And much misdeem or promise-bound thou stand'st<br/>To Thetis past recall, to exalt her son,<br/>And Greeks to slaughter thousands at the ships.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>To whom the cloud-assembler God, incensed.<br/>Ah subtle! ever teeming with surmise,<br/>And fathomer of my concealed designs,<br/>Thy toil is vain, or (which is worse for thee,)<br/>Shall but estrange thee from mine heart the more.<br/>And be it as thou sayest,â€”I am well pleased<br/>That so it should be. Be advised, desist,<br/>Hold thou thy peace. Else, if my glorious hands<br/>Once reach thee, the Olympian Powers combined<br/>To rescue thee, shall interfere in vain.<br/>
