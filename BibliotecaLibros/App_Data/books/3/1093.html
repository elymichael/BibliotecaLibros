Trouble thee aught, so safe a guard and sure<br/>He gives thee; Mercury shall be thy guide<br/>Even to Achilles' presence in his tent.<br/>Nor will himself Achilles slay thee there,<br/>Or even permit thy death, but will forbid<br/>All violence; for he is not unwise<br/>Nor heedless, noâ€”nor wilful to offend,<br/>But will his suppliant with much grace receive.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>So spake the swift ambassadress, and went.<br/>Then, calling to his sons, he bade them bring<br/>His litter forth, and bind the coffer on,<br/>While to his fragrant chamber he repair'd<br/>Himself, with cedar lined and lofty-roof'd,<br/>A treasury of wonders into which<br/>The Queen he summon'd, whom he thus bespake.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>
