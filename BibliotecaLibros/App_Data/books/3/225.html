Oppress'd him, into his huge shoulder driven.<br/>But Pæon&#160;him not liable to death<br/>With unction smooth of salutiferous balms<br/>Heal'd soon. Presumptuous, sacrilegious man!<br/>Careless what dire enormities he wrought,<br/>Who bent his bow against the powers of heaven!<br/>But blue-eyed Pallas instigated him<br/>By whom thou bleed'st. Infatuate! he forgets<br/>That whoso turns against the Gods his arm<br/>Lives never long; he never, safe escaped<br/>From furious fight, the lisp'd caresses hears<br/>Of his own infants prattling at his knees.<br/>Let therefore Diomede beware, lest strong<br/>And valiant as he is, he chance to meet<br/>Some mightier foe than thou, and lest his wife,<br/>Daughter of King Adrastus, the discrete<br/>Ægialea, from portentous dreams<br/>Upstarting, call her family to wail<br/>Her first-espoused, Achaia's proudest boast,<br/>Diomede, whom she must behold no more.<br/><br/>
