For Podalirius and Machaon both<br/>Are occupied. Machaon, as I judge,<br/>Lies wounded in his tent, needing like aid<br/>Himself, and Podalirius in the field<br/>Maintains sharp conflict with the sons of Troy.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>To whom Men≈ìtius' gallant son replied.<br/>Hero! Eurypylus! how shall we act<br/>In this perplexity? what course pursue?<br/>I seek the brave Achilles, to whose ear<br/>I bear a message from the ancient chief<br/>Gerenian Nestor, guardian of the Greeks.<br/>Yet will I not, even for such a cause,<br/>My friend! abandon thee in thy distress.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>He ended, and his arms folding around<br/>The warrior bore him thence into his tent.<br/>
