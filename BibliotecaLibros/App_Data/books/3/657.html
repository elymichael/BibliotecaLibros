Indissoluble? In the clouds of heaven<br/>I hung thee, while from the Olympian heights<br/>The Gods look'd mournful on, but of them all<br/>None could deliver thee, for whom I seized,<br/>Hurl'd through the gates of heaven on earth he fell,<br/>Half-breathless. Neither so did I resign<br/>My hot resentment of the hero's wrongs<br/>Immortal Hercules, whom thou by storms<br/>Call'd from the North, with mischievous intent<br/>Hadst driven far distant o'er the barren Deep<br/>To populous Cos. Thence I deliver'd him,<br/>And after numerous woes severe, he reach'd<br/>The shores of fruitful Argos, saved by me.<br/>I thus remind thee now, that thou mayst cease<br/>Henceforth from artifice, and mayst be taught<br/>How little all the dalliance and the love<br/>Which, stealing down from heaven, thou hast by fraud<br/>Obtain'd from me, shall profit thee at last.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>
