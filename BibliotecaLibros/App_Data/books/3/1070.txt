The cup, and Ajax took his prize, the ox.
He grasp'd his horn, and sputtering as he stood
The ordure forth, the Argives thus bespake.

&#160;

Ahâ€”Pallas tripp'd my footsteps; she attends
Ulysses ever with a mother's care.

&#160;

Loud laugh'd the Grecians. Then, the remnant prize
Antilochus receiving, smiled and said.

&#160;

Ye need not, fellow-warriors, to be taught
That now, as ever, the immortal Gods
Honor on seniority bestow.
Ajax is elder, yet not much, than I.
But Laertiades was born in times
