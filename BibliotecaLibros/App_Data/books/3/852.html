Perplex not with these cares thy soul.<br/>I would that when his fatal hour shall come,<br/>I could as sure secrete him from the stroke<br/>Of destiny, as he shall soon have arms<br/>Illustrious, such as each particular man<br/>Of thousands, seeing them, shall wish his own.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>He said, and to his bellows quick repair'd,<br/>Which turning to the fire he bade them heave.<br/>Full twenty bellows working all at once<br/>Breathed on the furnace, blowing easy and free<br/>The managed winds, now forcible, as best<br/>Suited dispatch, now gentle, if the will<br/>Of Vulcan and his labor so required.<br/>Impenetrable brass, tin, silver, gold,<br/>He cast into the forge, then, settling firm<br/>His ponderous anvil on the block, one hand<br/>With his huge hammer fill'd, one with the tongs.<br/>
