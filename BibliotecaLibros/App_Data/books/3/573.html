Stichius and Menestheus, leaders both<br/>Of the Athenians, to the host of Greece<br/>Bore off Amphimachus, and, fierce in arms<br/>The Ajaces, Imbrius. As two lions bear<br/>Through thick entanglement of boughs and brakes<br/>A goat snatch'd newly from the peasants' cogs,<br/>Upholding high their prey above the ground,<br/>So either Ajax terrible in fight,<br/>Upholding Imbrius high, his brazen arms<br/>Tore off, and OÃ¯liades his head<br/>From his smooth neck dissevering in revenge<br/>For slain Amphimachus, through all the host<br/>Sent it with swift rotation like a globe,<br/>Till in the dust at Hector's feet it fell.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Then anger fill'd the heart of Ocean's King,<br/>His grandson&#160;slain in battle; forth he pass'd<br/>Through the Achaian camp and fleet, the Greeks<br/>Rousing, and meditating wo to Troy.<br/>
