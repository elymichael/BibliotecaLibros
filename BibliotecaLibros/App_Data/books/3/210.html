Him answer'd then Lycaon's son renown'd.<br/>Brave leader of the Trojans brazen-mail'd,<br/>Ã†neas! By his buckler which I know,<br/>And by his helmet's height, considering, too<br/>His steeds, I deem him Diomede the bold;<br/>Yet such pronounce him not, who seems a God.<br/>But if bold Diomede indeed he be<br/>Of whom I speak, not without aid from heaven<br/>His fury thus prevails, but at his side<br/>Some God, in clouds enveloped, turns away<br/>From him the arrow to a devious course.<br/>Already, at his shoulder's hollow mail<br/>My shaft hath pierced him through, and him I deem'd<br/>Dismiss'd full sure to Pluto ere his time<br/>But he survives; whom therefore I at last<br/>Perforce conclude some angry Deity.<br/>Steeds have I none or chariot to ascend,<br/>Who have eleven chariots in the stands<br/>Left of Lycaon, with fair hangings all<br/>O'ermantled, strong, new finish'd, with their steeds<br/>In pairs beside them, eating winnow'd grain.<br/>
