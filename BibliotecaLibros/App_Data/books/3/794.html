Them oft with hasty lash Diores' son<br/>Automedon impatient smote, full oft<br/>He stroked them gently, and as oft he chode;<br/>Yet neither to the fleet ranged on the shore<br/>Of spacious Hellespont would they return,<br/>Nor with the Grecians seek the fight, but stood<br/>As a sepulchral pillar stands, unmoved<br/>Between their traces;&#160;to the earth they hung<br/>Their heads, with plenteous tears their driver mourn'd,<br/>And mingled their dishevell'd manes with dust.<br/>Jove saw their grief with pity, and his brows<br/>Shaking, within himself thus, pensive, said.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Ah hapless pair! Wherefore by gift divine<br/>Were ye to Peleus given, a mortal king,<br/>Yourselves immortal and from age exempt?<br/>Was it that ye might share in human woes?<br/>For, of all things that breathe or creep the earth,<br/>No creature lives so mere a wretch as man.<br/>
