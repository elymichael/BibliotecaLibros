Nobly endow'd with plenty and with wealth<br/>Distinguish'd by the Gods past all mankind,<br/>Lord of the Myrmidons, and, though a man,<br/>Yet match'd from heaven with an immortal bride.<br/>But even him the Gods afflict, a son<br/>Refusing him, who might possess his throne<br/>Hereafter; for myself, his only heir,<br/>Pass as a dream, and while I live, instead<br/>Of solacing his age, here sit, before<br/>Your distant walls, the scourge of thee and thine.<br/>Thee also, ancient Priam, we have heard<br/>Reported, once possessor of such wealth<br/>As neither Lesbos, seat of Macar, owns,<br/>Nor eastern Phrygia, nor yet all the ports<br/>Of Hellespont, but thou didst pass them all<br/>In riches, and in number of thy sons.<br/>But since the Powers of heaven brought on thy land<br/>This fatal war, battle and deeds of death<br/>Always surround the city where thou reign'st.<br/>Cease, therefore, from unprofitable tears,<br/>Which, ere they raise thy son to life again<br/>
