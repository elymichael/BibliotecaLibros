He ceased, and all sat mute. His challenge bold
None dared accept, which yet they blush'd to shun,
Till Menelaus, at the last, arose
Groaning profound, and thus reproach'd the Greeks.

&#160;

Ah boasters! henceforth women—men no more—
Eternal shame, shame infinite is ours,
If none of all the Grecians dares contend
With Hector. Dastards—deaf to glory's call—
Rot where ye sit! I will myself take arms
Against him, for the gods alone dispose,
At their own pleasure, the events of war.

&#160;

He ended, and put on his radiant arms.
Then, Menelaus, manifest appear'd
Thy death approaching by the dreadful hands
Of Hector, mightier far in arms than thou,
