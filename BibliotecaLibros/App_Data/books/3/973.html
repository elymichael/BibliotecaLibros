<br/>Renown'd Achilles! Thou art high in hope<br/>Doubtless, that thou shalt this day overthrow<br/>The city of the glorious sons of Troy.<br/>Fool! ye must labor yet ere she be won,<br/>For numerous are her citizens and bold,<br/>And we will guard her for our parents' sake<br/>Our wives and little ones. But here thou diest<br/>Terrible Chief and dauntless as thou art.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>He said, and with full force hurling his lance<br/>Smote, and err'd not, his greave beneath his knee<br/>The glittering tin, forged newly, at the stroke<br/>Tremendous rang, but quick recoil'd and vain<br/>The weapon, weak against that guard divine.<br/>Then sprang Achilles in his turn to assail<br/>Godlike Agenor, but Apollo took<br/>That glory from him, snatching wrapt in clouds<br/>Agenor thence, whom calm he sent away.<br/>
