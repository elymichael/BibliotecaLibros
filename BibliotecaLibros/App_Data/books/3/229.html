Grecians and Trojans on each other's breasts<br/>The bull-hide buckler batter'd and light targe.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Then thus Apollo to the warrior God.<br/>Gore-tainted homicide, town-batterer Mars!<br/>Wilt thou not meet and from the fight withdraw<br/>This man Tydides, now so fiery grown<br/>That he would even cope with Jove himself?<br/>First Venus' hand he wounded, and assail'd<br/>Impetuous as a God, next, even me.<br/>He ceased, and on the topmost turret sat<br/>Of Pergamus. Then all-destroyer Mars<br/>Ranging the Trojan host, rank after rank<br/>Exhorted loud, and in the form assumed<br/>Of Acamas the Thracian leader bold,<br/>The godlike sons of Priam thus harangued.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>
