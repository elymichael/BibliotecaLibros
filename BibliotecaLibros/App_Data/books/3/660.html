Achaia's host, which with base panic fill'd,<br/>Shall even to Achilles' ships be driven.<br/>Achilles shall his valiant friend exhort<br/>Patroclus forth; him under Ilium's walls<br/>Shall glorious Hector slay; but many a youth<br/>Shall perish by Patroclus first, with whom,<br/>My noble son Sarpedon. Peleus' son,<br/>Resentful of Patroclus' death, shall slay<br/>Hector, and I will urge ceaseless, myself,<br/>Thenceforth the routed Trojans back again,<br/>Till by Minerva's aid the Greeks shall take<br/>Ilium's proud city; till that day arrive<br/>My wrath shall burn, nor will I one permit<br/>Of all the Immortals to assist the Greeks,<br/>But will perform Achilles' whole desire.<br/>Such was my promise to him at the first,<br/>Ratified by a nod that self-same day<br/>When Thetis clasp'd my knees, begging revenge<br/>And glory for her city-spoiler son.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/>
