Laertes' noble son, for wiles renown'd!
Art thou too fugitive, and turn'st thy back
Like the base multitude? Ah! fear a lance
Implanted ignominious in thy spine.
Stopâ€”Nestor dies. Fell Hector is at hand.

So shouted Diomede, whose summons loud,
Ulysses yet heard not, but, passing, flew
With headlong haste to the Achaian fleet.

Rush'd ardent to the vanward, and before
The steeds of the Neleian sovereign old
Standing, in accents wing'd, him thus address'd.
