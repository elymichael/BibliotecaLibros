His bow elastic, wrapp'd himself around<br/>With a grey wolf-skin, to his head a casque<br/>Adjusted, coated o'er with ferret's felt,<br/>And seizing his sharp javelin, from the host<br/>Turn'd right toward the fleet, but was ordain'd<br/>To disappoint his sender, and to bring<br/>No tidings thence. The throng of Trojan steeds<br/>And warriors left, with brisker pace he moved,<br/>When brave Ulysses his approach perceived,<br/>And thus to Diomede his speech address'd.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Tydides! yonder man is from the host;<br/>Either a spy he comes, or with intent<br/>To spoil the dead. First, freely let him pass<br/>Few paces, then pursuing him with speed,<br/>Seize on him suddenly; but should he prove<br/>The nimbler of the three, with threatening spear<br/>Enforce him from his camp toward the fleet,<br/>Lest he elude us, and escape to Troy.<br/>
