And his fierce onset at a stroke repress'd.<br/>Hippodamas his weapon next received<br/>Within his spine, while with a leap he left<br/>His steeds and fled. He, panting forth his life,<br/>Moan'd like a bull, by consecrated youths<br/>Dragg'd round the Heliconian King,&#160;who views<br/>That victim with delight. So, with loud moans<br/>The noble warrior sigh'd his soul away.<br/>Then, spear in hand, against the godlike son<br/>Of Priam, Polydorus, he advanced.<br/>Not yet his father had to him indulged<br/>A warrior's place, for that of all his sons<br/>He was the youngest-born, his hoary sire's<br/>Chief darling, and in speed surpass'd them all.<br/>Then also, in the vanity of youth,<br/>For show of nimbleness, he started oft<br/>Into the vanward, till at last he fell.<br/>Him gliding swiftly by, swifter than he<br/>Achilles with a javelin reach'd; he struck<br/>His belt behind him, where the golden clasps<br/>Met, and the double hauberk interposed.<br/>
