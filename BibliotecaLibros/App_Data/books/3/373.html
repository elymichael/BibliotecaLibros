Make sprightly blaze, and place ye there a guard<br/>Sufficient, lest in absence of the troops<br/>An ambush enter, and surprise the town.<br/>Act thus, ye dauntless Trojans; the advice<br/>Is wholesome, and shall serve the present need,<br/>And so much for the night; ye shall be told<br/>The business of the morn when morn appears.<br/>It is my prayer to Jove and to all heaven<br/>(Not without hope) that I may hence expel<br/>These dogs, whom Ilium's unpropitious fates<br/>Have wafted hither in their sable barks.<br/>But we will also watch this night, ourselves,<br/>And, arming with the dawn, will at their ships<br/>Give them brisk onset. Then shall it appear<br/>If Diomede the brave shall me compel<br/>Back to our walls, or I, his arms blood-stain'd,<br/>Torn from his breathless body, bear away.<br/>To-morrow, if he dare but to abide<br/>My lance, he shall not want occasion meet<br/>For show of valor. But much more I judge<br/>That the next rising sun shall see him slain<br/>
