Make fierce assault; awhile at utmost speed<br/>They stretch toward him hungering, for the prey,<br/>But oft as, turning sudden, the stout brawn<br/>Faces them, scatter'd on all sides escape;<br/>The Trojans so, thick thronging in the rear,<br/>Ceaseless with falchions and spears double-edged<br/>Annoy'd them sore, but oft as in retreat<br/>The dauntless heroes, the Ajaces turn'd<br/>To face them, deadly wan grew every cheek,<br/>And not a Trojan dared with onset rude<br/>Molest them more in conflict for the dead.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Thus they, laborious, forth from battle bore<br/>Patroclus to the fleet, tempestuous war<br/>Their steps attending, rapid as the flames<br/>Which, kindled suddenly, some city waste;<br/>Consumed amid the blaze house after house<br/>Sinks, and the wind, meantime, roars through the fire;<br/>So them a deafening tumult as they went<br/>
