&#160;<br/><br/>Neptune, and thou, Minerva! with mature<br/>Deliberation, ponder the event.<br/>Yon Chief, Ã†neas, dazzling bright in arms;<br/>Goes to withstand Achilles, and he goes<br/>Sent by Apollo; in despite of whom<br/>Be it our task to give him quick repulse,<br/>Or, of ourselves, let some propitious Power<br/>Strengthen Achilles with a mind exempt<br/>From terror, and with force invincible.<br/>So shall he know that of the Gods above<br/>The mightiest are his friends, with whom compared<br/>The favorers of Ilium in time past,<br/>Who stood her guardians in the bloody strife,<br/>Are empty boasters all, and nothing worth.<br/>For therefore came we down, that we may share<br/>This fight, and that Achilles suffer nought<br/>Fatal to-day, though suffer all he must<br/>Hereafter, with his thread of life entwined<br/>By Destiny, the day when he was born.<br/>
