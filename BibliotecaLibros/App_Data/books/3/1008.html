Some mischief sure o'er Priam's sons impends.<br/>Far be such tidings from me! but I fear<br/>Horribly, lest Achilles, cutting off<br/>My dauntless Hector from the gates alone,<br/>Enforce him to the field, and quell perhaps<br/>The might, this moment, of that dreadful arm<br/>His hinderance long; for Hector ne'er was wont<br/>To seek his safety in the ranks, but flew<br/>First into battle, yielding place to none.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>So saying, she rush'd with palpitating heart<br/>And frantic air abroad, by her two maids<br/>Attended; soon arriving at the tower,<br/>And at the throng of men, awhile she stood<br/>Down-looking wistful from the city-wall,<br/>And, seeing him in front of Ilium, dragg'd<br/>So cruelly toward the fleet of Greece,<br/>O'erwhelm'd with sudden darkness at the view<br/>Fell backward, with a sigh heard all around.<br/>
