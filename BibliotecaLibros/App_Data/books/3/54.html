Seek to assuage<br/>His anger therefore; so shall he with smiles<br/>Cheer thee, nor thee alone, but all in heaven.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>So Vulcan, and, upstarting, placed a cup<br/>Full-charged between his mother's hands, and said,<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>My mother, be advised, and, though aggrieved,<br/>Yet patient; lest I see thee whom I love<br/>So dear, with stripes chastised before my face,<br/>Willing, but impotent to give thee aid.<br/>Who can resist the Thunderer? Me, when once<br/>I flew to save thee, by the foot he seized<br/>And hurl'd me through the portal of the skies.<br/>
