But, when, the sun descending, darkness fell,<br/>They on the beach beside their hawsers slept;<br/>And, when the day-spring's daughter rosy-palm'd<br/>Aurora look'd abroad, then back they steer'd<br/>To the vast camp. Fair wind, and blowing fresh,<br/>Apollo sent them; quick they rear'd the mast,<br/>Then spread the unsullied canvas to the gale,<br/>And the wind filled it. Roared the sable flood<br/>Around the bark, that ever as she went<br/>Dash'd wide the brine, and scudded swift away.<br/>Thus reaching soon the spacious camp of Greece,<br/>Their galley they updrew sheer o'er the sands<br/>From the rude surge remote, then propp'd her sides<br/>With scantlings long,&#160;and sought their several tents.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>But Peleus' noble son, the speed-renown'd<br/>Achilles, he, his well-built bark beside,<br/>Consumed his hours, nor would in council more,<br/>Where wise men win distinction, or in fight<br/>
