Retracting, placed it at Achilles' feet.<br/>Then, lifting high Æneas from the ground,<br/>He heaved him far remote; o'er many a rank<br/>Of heroes and of bounding steeds he flew,<br/>Launch'd into air from the expanded palm<br/>Of Neptune, and alighted in the rear<br/>Of all the battle where the Caucons stood.<br/>Neptune approach'd him there, and at his side<br/>Standing, in accents wing'd, him thus bespake.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>What God, Æneas! tempted thee to cope<br/>Thus inconsiderately with the son<br/>Of Peleus, both more excellent in fight<br/>Than thou, and more the favorite of the skies?<br/>From him retire hereafter, or expect<br/>A premature descent into the shades.<br/>But when Achilles shall have once fulfill'd<br/>His destiny, in battle slain, then fight<br/>Fearless, for thou canst fall by none beside.<br/>
