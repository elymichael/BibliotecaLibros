Refulgent on they moved, by Neptune led<br/>With firm hand grasping his long-bladed sword<br/>Keen as Jove's bolt; with him may none contend<br/>In dreadful fight; but fear chains every arm.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Opposite, Priameian Hector ranged<br/>His Trojans; then they stretch'd the bloody cord<br/>Of conflict tight, Neptune c≈ìrulean-hair'd,<br/>And Hector, pride of Ilium; one, the Greeks<br/>Supporting firm, and one, the powers of Troy;<br/>A sea-flood dash'd the galleys, and the hosts<br/>Join'd clamorous. Not so the billows roar<br/>The shores among, when Boreas' roughest blast<br/>Sweeps landward from the main the towering surge;<br/>Not so, devouring fire among the trees<br/>That clothe the mountain, when the sheeted flames<br/>Ascending wrap the forest in a blaze;<br/>Nor howl the winds through leafy boughs of oaks<br/>Upgrown aloft (though loudest there they rave)<br/>
