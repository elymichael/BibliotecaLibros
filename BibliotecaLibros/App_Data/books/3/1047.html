Arise and look ye forth yourselves, for I<br/>With doubtful ken behold him; yet the man<br/>Seems, in my view, Ætolian by descent,<br/>A Chief of prime renown in Argos' host,<br/>The hero Tydeus' son, brave Diomede,<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>But Ajax Oïliades the swift<br/>Him sharp reproved. Why art thou always given<br/>To prate, Idomeneus? thou seest the mares,<br/>Remote indeed, but posting to the goal.<br/>Thou art not youngest of the Argives here<br/>So much, nor from beneath thy brows look forth<br/>Quick-sighted more than ours, thine eyes abroad.<br/>Yet still thou pratest, although silence more<br/>Should suit thee, among wiser far than thou.<br/>The mares which led, lead still, and he who drives<br/>Eumelus is, the same who drove before.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/>
