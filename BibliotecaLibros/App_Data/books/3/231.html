Alone, were guard sufficient for the town.<br/>But none of all thy kindred now appears;<br/>I can discover none; they stand aloof<br/>Quaking, as dogs that hear the lion's roar.<br/>We bear the stress, who are but Troy's allies;<br/>Myself am such, and from afar I came;<br/>For Lycia lies far distant on the banks<br/>Of the deep-eddied Xanthus. There a wife<br/>I left and infant son, both dear to me,<br/>With plenteous wealth, the wish of all who want.<br/>Yet urge I still my Lycians, and am prompt<br/>Myself to fight, although possessing here<br/>Nought that the Greeks can carry or drive hence.<br/>But there stand'st thou, neither employed thyself,<br/>Nor moving others to an active part<br/>For all their dearest pledges. Oh beware!<br/>Lest, as with meshes of an ample net,<br/>At one huge draught the Grecians sweep you all,<br/>And desolate at once your populous Troy!<br/>By day, by night, thoughts such as these should still<br/>Thy conduct influence, and from Chief to Chief<br/>
