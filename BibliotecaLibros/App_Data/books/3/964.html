Aid'st thou for this the Trojans? Canst thou less<br/>Than seek, with us, to exterminate the whole<br/>Perfidious race, wives, children, husbands, all?<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>To whom the King of radiant shafts Apollo.<br/>Me, Neptune, thou wouldst deem, thyself, unwise<br/>Contending for the sake of mortal men<br/>With thee; a wretched race, who like the leaves<br/>Now flourish rank, by fruits of earth sustain'd,<br/>Now sapless fall. Here, therefore, us between<br/>Let all strife cease, far better left to them.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>He said, and turn'd away, fearing to lift<br/>His hand against the brother of his sire.<br/>But him Diana of the woods with sharp<br/>Rebuke, his huntress sister, thus reproved.<br/><br/>
