Stoop to thy spear, nor to the spear itself<br/>Of Peleus' son, though mightier far than thou.<br/><br/>He said, and Menœtiades the wrath<br/>Of shaft-arm'd Phœbus shunning, far retired.<br/>But in the Scæan gate Hector his steeds<br/>Detain'd, uncertain whether thence to drive<br/>Amid the warring multitude again,<br/>Or, loud commandment issuing, to collect<br/>His host within the walls. Him musing long<br/>Apollo, clad in semblance of a Chief<br/>Youthful and valiant, join'd. Asius he seem'd<br/>Equestrian Hector's uncle, brother born<br/>Of Hecuba the queen, and Dymas' son,<br/>Who on the Sangar's banks in Phrygia dwelt.<br/>Apollo, so disguised, him thus bespake.<br/><br/>Why, Hector, hast thou left the fight? this sloth<br/>Not well befits thee. Oh that I as far<br/>Thee pass'd in force as thou transcendest me,<br/>Then, not unpunish'd long, should'st thou retire;<br/>
