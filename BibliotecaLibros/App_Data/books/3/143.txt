All-glorious Jove, and ye the powers of heaven,
Whoso shall violate this contract first,
So be the brains of them and of their sons
Pour'd out, as we this wine pour on the earth,
And may their wives bring forth to other men!

&#160;

So they: but them Jove heard not. Then arose
Priam, the son of Dardanus, and said,

&#160;

Hear me, ye Trojans and ye Greeks well-arm'd.
Hence back to wind-swept Ilium I return,
Unable to sustain the sight, my son
With warlike Menela√ºs match'd in arms.
Jove knows, and the immortal Gods, to whom
Of both, this day is preordain'd the last.
