<br/><br/><br/>Book XXIII<br/><br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>ARGUMENT OF THE TWENTY-THIRD BOOK.<br/><br/>The body of Patroclus is burned, and the funeral games<br/>ensue.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>Such mourning was in Troy; meantime the Greeks<br/>Their galleys and the shores of Hellespont<br/>Regaining, each to his own ship retired.<br/>But not the Myrmidons; Achilles them<br/>Close rank'd in martial order still detain'd,<br/>And thus his fellow-warriors brave address'd.<br/><br/>
