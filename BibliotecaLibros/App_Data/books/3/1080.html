Of such a friend, so manly, and so brave.<br/>Their fellowship in toil; their hardships oft<br/>Sustain'd in fight laborious, or o'ercome<br/>With difficulty on the perilous deep—<br/>Remembrance busily retracing themes<br/>Like these, drew down his cheeks continual tears.<br/>Now on his side he lay, now lay supine,<br/>Now prone, then starting from his couch he roam'd<br/>Forlorn the beach, nor did the rising morn<br/>On seas and shores escape his watchful eye,<br/>But joining to his chariot his swift steeds,<br/>He fasten'd Hector to be dragg'd behind.<br/>Around the tomb of Menœtiades<br/>Him thrice he dragg'd; then rested in his tent,<br/>Leaving him at his length stretch'd in the dust.<br/>Meantime Apollo with compassion touch'd<br/>Even of the lifeless Hector, from all taint<br/>Saved him, and with the golden ægis broad<br/>Covering, preserved him, although dragg'd, untorn.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/>
