Feeble and spiritless, and from thy host
Apart? what new disaster hath befall'n?

To whom with difficulty thus replied
The warlike Chief.â€”But tell me who art Thou,
Divine inquirer! best of powers above!
Know'st not that dauntless Ajax me his friends
Slaughtering at yonder ships, hath with a stone
Surceased from fight, smiting me on the breast?
I thought to have beheld, this day, the dead
In Ades, every breath so seem'd my last.

Courage this moment! such a helper Jove
From Ida sends thee at thy side to war
