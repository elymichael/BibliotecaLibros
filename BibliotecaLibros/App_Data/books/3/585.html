Cassandra, but no nuptial gift vouchsafed<br/>To offer, save a sounding promise proud<br/>To chase, himself, however resolute<br/>The Grecian host, and to deliver Troy.<br/>To him assenting, Priam, ancient King,<br/>Assured to him his wish, and in the faith<br/>Of that assurance confident, he fought.<br/>But brave Idomeneus his splendid lance<br/>Well-aim'd dismissing, struck the haughty Chief.<br/>Pacing elate the field; his brazen mail<br/>Endured not; through his bowels pierced, with clang<br/>Of all his arms he fell, and thus with joy<br/>Immense exulting, spake Idomeneus.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>I give thee praise, Othryoneus! beyond<br/>All mortal men, if truly thou perform<br/>Thy whole big promise to the Dardan king,<br/>Who promised thee his daughter. Now, behold,<br/>We also promise: doubt not the effect.<br/>
