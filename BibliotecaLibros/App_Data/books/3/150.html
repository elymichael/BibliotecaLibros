<br/>Haste—Paris calls thee—on his sculptured couch,<br/>(Sparkling alike his looks and his attire)<br/>He waits thy wish'd return. Thou wouldst not dream<br/>That he had fought; he rather seems prepared<br/>For dance, or after dance, for soft repose.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>So saying, she tumult raised in Helen's mind.<br/>Yet soon as by her symmetry of neck,<br/>By her love-kindling breasts and luminous eyes<br/>She knew the Goddess, her she thus bespake.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Ah whence, deceitful deity! thy wish<br/>Now to ensnare me? Wouldst thou lure me, say,<br/>To some fair city of Mæonian name<br/>Or Phrygian, more remote from Sparta still?<br/>Hast thou some human favorite also there?<br/>
