Watch all the night; he famish'd, yet again<br/>Comes furious on, but speeds not, kept aloof<br/>By spears from daring hands dismissed, but more<br/>By flash of torches which, though fierce, he dreads,<br/>Till at the dawn, sullen he stalks away;<br/>So from Patroclus Menelaus went<br/>Heroic Chief! reluctant; for he fear'd<br/>Lest the Achaians should resign the dead,<br/>Through consternation, to the host of Troy.<br/>Departing, therefore, he admonish'd oft<br/>Meriones and the Ajaces, thus.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Ye two brave leaders of the Argive host,<br/>And thou, Meriones! now recollect<br/>The gentle manners of Patroclus fallen<br/>Hapless in battle, who by carriage mild<br/>Well understood, while yet he lived, to engage<br/>All hearts, through prisoner now of death and fate.<br/><br/>
