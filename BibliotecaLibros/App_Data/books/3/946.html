And forceful arm of Peleus' son, beside<br/>The eddy-whirling stream fled all dispersed.<br/>Thersilochus and Mydon then he slew,<br/>Thrasius, Astypylus and Ophelestes,<br/>Ænius and Mnesus; nor had these sufficed<br/>Achilles, but Pœonians more had fallen,<br/>Had not the angry River from within<br/>His circling gulfs in semblance, of a man<br/>Call'd to him, interrupting thus his rage.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Oh both in courage and injurious deeds<br/>Unmatch'd, Achilles! whom themselves the Gods<br/>Cease not to aid, if Saturn's son have doom'd<br/>All Ilium's race to perish by thine arm,<br/>Expel them, first, from me, ere thou achieve<br/>That dread exploit; for, cumber'd as I am<br/>With bodies, I can pour my pleasant stream<br/>No longer down into the sacred deep;<br/>All vanish where thou comest. But oh desist<br/>
