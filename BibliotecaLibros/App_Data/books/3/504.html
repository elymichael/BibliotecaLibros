Of Ã†sculapius, mounted at his side.<br/>He lash'd the steeds, they not unwilling sought<br/>The hollow ships, long their familiar home.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Cebriones, meantime, the charioteer<br/>Of Hector, from his seat the Trojan ranks<br/>Observing sore discomfited, began.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Here are we busied, Hector! on the skirts<br/>Of roaring battle, and meantime I see<br/>Our host confused, their horses and themselves<br/>All mingled. Telamonian Ajax there<br/>Routs them; I know the hero by his shield.<br/>Haste, drive we thither, for the carnage most<br/>Of horse and foot conflicting furious, there<br/>Rages, and infinite the shouts arise.<br/><br/>
