"Here's mine!" and Amy waved her pencil.

"I haven't got any," said Meg forlornly.

"Yes, you have," said Laurie at once.

"Where?"

"In your face."

"Nonsense, that's of no use."

"Wait and see if it doesn't bring you something worth having,"
replied the boy, laughing at the thought of a charming little
secret which he fancied he knew.

across the river with the same expectant expression which Mr.
Brooke had worn when he told the story of the knight.

"If we are all alive ten years hence, let's meet, and see how
many of us have got our wishes, or how much nearer we are then than

"Bless me! How old I shall be, twenty-seven!" exclaimed Meg, who
felt grown up already, having just reached seventeen.

"You and I will be twenty-six, Teddy, Beth twenty-four, and Amy
twenty-two. What a venerable party!" said Jo.
