The record of a peaceful lifeâ€”<br/>Gifts to gentle child and girl,<br/>A bridal gown, lines to a wife,<br/>A tiny shoe, a baby curl.<br/>No toys in this first chest remain,<br/>For all are carried away,<br/>In their old age, to join again<br/>In another small Meg's play.<br/>Ah, happy mother! Well I know<br/>You hear, like a sweet refrain,<br/>Lullabies ever soft and low<br/>In the falling summer rain.<br/><br/>"Jo" on the next lid, scratched and worn,<br/>And within a motley store<br/>Of headless dolls, of schoolbooks torn,<br/>Birds and beasts that speak no more,<br/>Spoils brought home from the fairy ground<br/>Only trod by youthful feet,<br/>Dreams of a future never found,<br/>Memories of a past still sweet,<br/>
