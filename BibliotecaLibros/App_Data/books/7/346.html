<br/>"What happens then, a ball?"<br/><br/>"A Christmas party at our hotel. There are many Americans there,<br/>and they give it in honor of the day. You'll go with us, of course?<br/>Aunt will be charmed."<br/><br/>"Thank you. Where now?" asked Laurie, leaning back and folding<br/>his arms, a proceeding which suited Amy, who preferred to drive,<br/>for her parasol whip and blue reins over the white ponies backs<br/>afforded her infinite satisfaction.<br/><br/>"I'm going to the bankers first for letters, and then to Castle<br/>Hill. The view is so lovely, and I like to feed the peacocks. Have<br/>you ever been there?"<br/><br/>"Often, years ago, but I don't mind having a look at it."<br/><br/>"Now tell me all about yourself. The last I heard of you, your<br/>grandfather wrote that he expected you from Berlin."<br/><br/>"Yes, I spent a month there and then joined him in Paris, where<br/>he has settled for the winter. He has friends there and finds<br/>plenty to amuse him, so I go and come, and we get on<br/>capitally."<br/><br/>"That's a sociable arrangement," said Amy, missing something in<br/>Laurie's manner, though she couldn't tell what.<br/><br/>"Why, you see, he hates to travel, and I hate to keep still, so<br/>we each suit ourselves, and there is no trouble. I am often with<br/>him, and he enjoys my adventures, while I like to feel that someone<br/>is glad to see me when I get back from my wanderings. Dirty old<br/>hole, isn't it?" he added, with a look of disgust as they drove<br/>along the boulevard to the Place Napoleon in the old city.<br/><br/>"The dirt is picturesque, so I don't mind. The river and the<br/>hills are delicious, and these glimpses of the narrow cross streets<br/>are my delight. Now we shall have to wait for that procession to<br/>pass. It's going to the Church of St. John."<br/><br/>
