<br/>"Let us say nothing about it to him till the plan is settled,<br/>then I'll run away before he can collect his wits and be tragic.<br/>Beth must think I'm going to please myself, as I am, for I can't<br/>talk about Laurie to her. But she can pet and comfort him after I'm<br/>gone, and so cure him of this romantic notion. He's been through so<br/>many little trials of the sort, he's used to it, and will soon get<br/>over his lovelornity."<br/><br/>Jo spoke hopefully, but could not rid herself of the foreboding<br/>fear that this 'little trial' would be harder than the others, and<br/>that Laurie would not get over his 'lovelornity' as easily as<br/>heretofore.<br/><br/>The plan was talked over in a family council and agreed upon,<br/>for Mrs. Kirke gladly accepted Jo, and promised to make a pleasant<br/>home for her. The teaching would render her independent, and such<br/>leisure as she got might be made profitable by writing, while the<br/>new scenes and society would be both useful and agreeable. Jo liked<br/>the prospect and was eager to be gone, for the home nest was<br/>growing too narrow for her restless nature and adventurous spirit.<br/>When all was settled, with fear and trembling she told Laurie, but<br/>to her surprise he took it very quietly. He had been graver than<br/>usual of late, but very pleasant, and when jokingly accused of<br/>turning over a new leaf, he answered soberly, "So I am, and I mean<br/>this one shall stay turned."<br/><br/>Jo was very much relieved that one of his virtuous fits should<br/>come on just then, and made her preparations with a lightened<br/>heart, for Beth seemed more cheerful, and hoped she was doing the<br/>best for all.<br/><br/>"One thing I leave in your especial care," she said, the night<br/>before she left.<br/><br/>"You mean your papers?" asked Beth.<br/><br/>"No, my boy. Be very good to him, won't you?"<br/><br/>"Of course I will, but I can't fill your place, and he'll miss<br/>you sadly."<br/><br/>"It won't hurt him, so remember, I leave him in your charge, to<br/>plague, pet, and keep in order."<br/><br/>"I'll do my best, for your sake," promised Beth, wondering why<br/>Jo looked at her so queerly.<br/><br/>
