"Not at all. Where is the use of having a lot of dresses when<br/>she isn't out yet? There's no need of sending home, Daisy, even if<br/>you had a dozen, for I've got a sweet blue silk laid away, which<br/>I've outgrown, and you shall wear it to please me, won't you,<br/>dear?"<br/><br/>"You are very kind, but I don't mind my old dress if you don't,<br/>it does well enough for a little girl like me," said Meg.<br/><br/>"Now do let me please myself by dressing you up in style. I<br/>admire to do it, and you'd be a regular little beauty with a touch<br/>here and there. I shan't let anyone see you till you are done, and<br/>then we'll burst upon them like Cinderella and her godmother going<br/>to the ball," said Belle in her persuasive tone.<br/><br/>Meg couldn't refuse the offer so kindly made, for a desire to<br/>see if she would be 'a little beauty' after touching up caused her<br/>to accept and forget all her former uncomfortable feelings toward<br/>the Moffats.<br/><br/>On the Thursday evening, Belle shut herself up with her maid,<br/>and between them they turned Meg into a fine lady. They crimped and<br/>curled her hair, they polished her neck and arms with some fragrant<br/>powder, touched her lips with coralline salve to make them redder,<br/>and Hortense would have added 'a soupcon of rouge', if Meg had not<br/>rebelled. They laced her into a sky-blue dress, which was so tight<br/>she could hardly breathe and so low in the neck that modest Meg<br/>blushed at herself in the mirror. A set of silver filagree was<br/>added, bracelets, necklace, brooch, and even earrings, for Hortense<br/>tied them on with a bit of pink silk which did not show. A cluster<br/>of tea-rose buds at the bosom, and a ruche, reconciled Meg to the<br/>display of her pretty, white shoulders, and a pair of high-heeled<br/>silk boots satisfied the last wish of her heart. A lace<br/>handkerchief, a plumy fan, and a bouquet in a shoulder holder<br/>finished her off, and Miss Belle surveyed her with the satisfaction<br/>of a little girl with a newly dressed doll.<br/><br/>"Mademoiselle is charmante, tres jolie, is she not?" cried<br/>Hortense, clasping her hands in an affected rapture.<br/><br/>"Come and show yourself," said Miss Belle, leading the way to<br/>the room where the others were waiting.<br/><br/>As Meg went rustling after, with her long skirts trailing, her<br/>earrings tinkling, her curls waving, and her heart beating, she<br/>felt as if her fun had really begun at last, for the mirror had<br/>plainly told her that she was 'a little beauty'. Her friends<br/>repeated the pleasing phrase enthusiastically, and for several<br/>minutes she stood, like a jackdaw in the fable, enjoying her<br/>borrowed plumes, while the rest chattered like a party of<br/>magpies.<br/><br/>"While I dress, do you drill her, Nan, in the management of her<br/>skirt and those French heels, or she will trip herself up. Take<br/>your silver butterfly, and catch up that long curl on the left side<br/>of her head, Clara, and don't any of you disturb the charming work<br/>of my hands," said Belle, as she hurried away, looking well pleased<br/>with her success.<br/><br/>"You don't look a bit like yourself, but you are very nice. I'm<br/>nowhere beside you, for Belle has heaps of taste, and you're quite<br/>French, I assure you. Let your flowers hang, don't be so careful of<br/>them, and be sure you don't trip," returned Sallie, trying not to<br/>care that Meg was prettier than herself.<br/><br/>Keeping that warning carefully in mind, Margaret got safely down<br/>stairs and sailed into the drawing rooms where the Moffats and a<br/>few early guests were assembled. She very soon discovered that<br/>there is a charm about fine clothes which attracts a certain class<br/>of people and secures their respect. Several young ladies, who had<br/>taken no notice of her before, were very affectionate all of a<br/>sudden. Several young gentlemen, who had only stared at her at the<br/>other party, now not only stared, but asked to be introduced, and<br/>said all manner of foolish but agreeable things to her, and several<br/>old ladies, who sat on the sofas, and criticized the rest of the<br/>party, inquired who she was with an air of interest. She heard Mrs.<br/>Moffat reply to one of themâ€¦<br/>
