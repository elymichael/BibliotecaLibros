Coffee was a treat, and Hannah showed great tact in making it<br/>that morning. No one could resist her persuasive nods, or the<br/>fragrant invitation issuing from the nose of the coffee pot. They<br/>drew up to the table, exchanged their handkerchiefs for napkins,<br/>and in ten minutes were all right again.<br/><br/>"'Hope and keep busy', that's the motto for us, so let's see who<br/>will remember it best. I shall go to Aunt March, as usual. Oh,<br/>won't she lecture though!" said Jo, as she sipped with returning<br/>spirit.<br/><br/>"I shall go to my Kings, though I'd much rather stay at home and<br/>attend to things here," said Meg, wishing she hadn't made her eyes<br/>so red.<br/><br/>"No need of that. Beth and I can keep house perfectly well," put<br/>in Amy, with an important air.<br/><br/>"Hannah will tell us what to do, and we'll have everything nice<br/>when you come home," added Beth, getting out her mop and dish tub<br/>without delay.<br/><br/>"I think anxiety is very interesting," observed Amy, eating<br/>sugar pensively.<br/><br/>The girls couldn't help laughing, and felt better for it, though<br/>Meg shook her head at the young lady who could find consolation in<br/>a sugar bowl.<br/><br/>The sight of the turnovers made Jo sober again; and when the two<br/>went out to their daily tasks, they looked sorrowfully back at the<br/>window where they were accustomed to see their mother's face. It<br/>was gone, but Beth had remembered the little household ceremony,<br/>and there she was, nodding away at them like a rosyfaced<br/>mandarin.<br/><br/>"That's so like my Beth!" said Jo, waving her hat, with a<br/>grateful face. "Goodbye, Meggy, I hope the Kings won't strain<br/>today. Don't fret about Father, dear," she added, as they<br/>parted.<br/><br/>"And I hope Aunt March won't croak. Your hair is becoming, and<br/>it looks very boyish and nice," returned Meg, trying not to smile<br/>at the curly head, which looked comically small on her tall<br/>sister's shoulders.<br/><br/>"That's my only comfort." And, touching her hat a la Laurie,<br/>away went Jo, feeling like a shorn sheep on a wintry day.<br/>
