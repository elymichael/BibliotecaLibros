Coffee was a treat, and Hannah showed great tact in making it
that morning. No one could resist her persuasive nods, or the
fragrant invitation issuing from the nose of the coffee pot. They
drew up to the table, exchanged their handkerchiefs for napkins,
and in ten minutes were all right again.

"'Hope and keep busy', that's the motto for us, so let's see who
will remember it best. I shall go to Aunt March, as usual. Oh,
won't she lecture though!" said Jo, as she sipped with returning
spirit.

"I shall go to my Kings, though I'd much rather stay at home and
attend to things here," said Meg, wishing she hadn't made her eyes
so red.

"No need of that. Beth and I can keep house perfectly well," put
in Amy, with an important air.

"Hannah will tell us what to do, and we'll have everything nice
when you come home," added Beth, getting out her mop and dish tub
without delay.

"I think anxiety is very interesting," observed Amy, eating
sugar pensively.

The girls couldn't help laughing, and felt better for it, though
Meg shook her head at the young lady who could find consolation in
a sugar bowl.

The sight of the turnovers made Jo sober again; and when the two
went out to their daily tasks, they looked sorrowfully back at the
window where they were accustomed to see their mother's face. It
was gone, but Beth had remembered the little household ceremony,
and there she was, nodding away at them like a rosyfaced
mandarin.

"That's so like my Beth!" said Jo, waving her hat, with a
grateful face. "Goodbye, Meggy, I hope the Kings won't strain
today. Don't fret about Father, dear," she added, as they
parted.

"And I hope Aunt March won't croak. Your hair is becoming, and
it looks very boyish and nice," returned Meg, trying not to smile
at the curly head, which looked comically small on her tall
sister's shoulders.

"That's my only comfort." And, touching her hat a la Laurie,
away went Jo, feeling like a shorn sheep on a wintry day.
