<br/>Amy recovered herself in a breath, set her basket boldly on the<br/>seat, and said, laughing, "Don't you wish you were to have some of<br/>the salad he's going to make, and to see the charming young ladies<br/>who are to eat it?"<br/><br/>Now that was tact, for two of the ruling foibles of the<br/>masculine mind were touched. The lobster was instantly surrounded<br/>by a halo of pleasing reminiscences, and curiosity about 'the<br/>charming young ladies' diverted his mind from the comical<br/>mishap.<br/><br/>"I suppose he'll laugh and joke over it with Laurie, but I<br/>shan't see them, that's a comfort," thought Amy, as Tudor bowed and<br/>departed.<br/><br/>She did not mention this meeting at home (though she discovered<br/>that, thanks to the upset, her new dress was much damaged by the<br/>rivulets of dressing that meandered down the skirt), but went<br/>through with the preparations which now seemed more irksome than<br/>before, and at twelve o'clock all was ready again. Feeling that the<br/>neighbors were interested in her movements, she wished to efface<br/>the memory of yesterday's failure by a grand success today, so she<br/>ordered the 'cherry bounce', and drove away in state to meet and<br/>escort her guests to the banquet.<br/><br/>"There's the rumble, they're coming! I'll go onto the porch and<br/>meet them. It looks hospitable, and I want the poor child to have a<br/>good time after all her trouble," said Mrs. March, suiting the<br/>action to the word. But after one glance, she retired, with an<br/>indescribable expression, for looking quite lost in the big<br/>carriage, sat Amy and one young lady.<br/><br/>"Run, Beth, and help Hannah clear half the things off the table.<br/>It will be too absurd to put a luncheon for twelve before a single<br/>girl," cried Jo, hurrying away to the lower regions, too excited to<br/>stop even for a laugh.<br/><br/>In came Amy, quite calm and delightfully cordial to the one<br/>guest who had kept her promise. The rest of the family, being of a<br/>dramatic turn, played their parts equally well, and Miss Eliott<br/>found them a most hilarious set, for it was impossible to control<br/>entirely the merriment which possessed them. The remodeled lunch<br/>being gaily partaken of, the studio and garden visited, and art<br/>discussed with enthusiasm, Amy ordered a buggy (alas for the<br/>elegant cherry-bounce), and drove her friend quietly about the<br/>neighborhood till sunset, when 'the party went out'.<br/><br/>As she came walking in, looking very tired but as composed as<br/>ever, she observed that every vestige of the unfortunate fete had<br/>disappeared, except a suspicious pucker about the corners of Jo's<br/>mouth.<br/><br/>"You've had a loverly afternoon for your drive, dear," said her<br/>mother, as respectfully as if the whole twelve had come.<br/><br/>"Miss Eliott is a very sweet girl, and seemed to enjoy herself,<br/>I thought," observed Beth, with unusual warmth.<br/><br/>
