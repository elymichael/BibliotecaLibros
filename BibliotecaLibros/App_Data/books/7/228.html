<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>23<br/>Aunt March Settles the Question<br/><br/><br/>Like bees swarming after their queen, mother and daughters<br/>hovered about Mr. March the next day, neglecting everything to look<br/>at, wait upon, and listen to the new invalid, who was in a fair way<br/>to be killed by kindness. As he sat propped up in a big chair by<br/>Beth's sofa, with the other three close by, and Hannah popping in<br/>her head now and then 'to peek at the dear man', nothing seemed<br/>needed to complete their happiness. But something was needed, and<br/>the elder ones felt it, though none confessed the fact. Mr. and<br/>Mrs. March looked at one another with an anxious expression, as<br/>their eyes followed Meg. Jo had sudden fits of sobriety, and was<br/>seen to shake her fist at Mr. Brooke's umbrella, which had been<br/>left in the hall. Meg was absent-minded, shy, and silent, started<br/>when the bell rang, and colored when John's name was mentioned. Amy<br/>said, "Everyone seemed waiting for something, and couldn't settle<br/>down, which was queer, since Father was safe at home," and Beth<br/>innocently wondered why their neighbors didn't run over as<br/>usual.<br/><br/>Laurie went by in the afternoon, and seeing Meg at the window,<br/>seemed suddenly possessed with a melodramatic fit, for he fell down<br/>on one knee in the snow, beat his breast, tore his hair, and<br/>clasped his hands imploringly, as if begging some boon. And when<br/>Meg told him to behave himself and go away, he wrung imaginary<br/>tears out of his handkerchief, and staggered round the corner as if<br/>in utter despair.<br/><br/>"What does the goose mean?" said Meg, laughing and trying to<br/>look unconscious.<br/><br/>"He's showing you how your John will go on by-and-by. Touching,<br/>isn't it?" answered Jo scornfully.<br/><br/>"Don't say my John, it isn't proper or true," but Meg's voice<br/>lingered over the words as if they sounded pleasant to her. "Please<br/>don't plague me, Jo, I've told you I don't care much about him, and<br/>there isn't to be anything said, but we are all to be friendly, and<br/>go on as before."<br/><br/>"We can't, for something has been said, and Laurie's mischief<br/>has spoiled you for me. I see it, and so does Mother. You are not<br/>like your old self a bit, and seem ever so far away from me. I<br/>don't mean to plague you and will bear it like a man, but I do wish<br/>it was all settled. I hate to wait, so if you mean ever to do it,<br/>make haste and have it over quickly," said Jo pettishly.<br/><br/>"I can't say anything till he speaks, and he won't, because<br/>Father said I was too young," began Meg, bending over her work with<br/>a queer little smile, which suggested that she did not quite agree<br/>with her father on that point.<br/>
