<br/>"Poor little souls, they will have a hard time, I'm afraid, but<br/>they won't suffer, and it will do them good," she said, producing<br/>the more palatable viands with which she had provided herself, and<br/>disposing of the bad breakfast, so that their feelings might not be<br/>hurt, a motherly little deception for which they were grateful.<br/><br/>Many were the complaints below, and great the chagrin of the<br/>head cook at her failures. "Never mind, I'll get the dinner and be<br/>servant, you be mistress, keep your hands nice, see company, and<br/>give orders," said Jo, who knew still less than Meg about culinary<br/>affairs.<br/><br/>This obliging offer was gladly accepted, and Margaret retired to<br/>the parlor, which she hastily put in order by whisking the litter<br/>under the sofa and shutting the blinds to save the trouble of<br/>dusting. Jo, with perfect faith in her own powers and a friendly<br/>desire to make up the quarrel, immediately put a note in the<br/>office, inviting Laurie to dinner.<br/><br/>"You'd better see what you have got before you think of having<br/>company," said Meg, when informed of the hospitable but rash<br/>act.<br/><br/>"Oh, there's corned beef and plenty of poatoes, and I shall get<br/>some asparagus and a lobster, 'for a relish', as Hannah says. We'll<br/>have lettuce and make a salad. I don't know how, but the book<br/>tells. I'll have blanc mange and strawberries for dessert, and<br/>coffee too, if you want to be elegant."<br/><br/>"Don't try too many messes, Jo, for you can't make anything but<br/>gingerbread and molasses candy fit to eat. I wash my hands of the<br/>dinner party, and since you have asked Laurie on your own<br/>responsibility, you may just take care of him."<br/><br/>"I don't want you to do anything but be civil to him and help to<br/>the pudding. You'll give me your advice if I get in a muddle, won't<br/>you?" asked Jo, rather hurt.<br/><br/>"Yes, but I don't know much, except about bread and a few<br/>trifles. You had better ask Mother's leave before you order<br/>anything," returned Meg prudently.<br/><br/>"Of course I shall. I'm not a fool." And Jo went off in a huff<br/>at the doubts expressed of her powers.<br/><br/>"Get what you like, and don't disturb me. I'm going out to<br/>dinner and can't worry about things at home," said Mrs. March, when<br/>Jo spoke to her. "I never enjoyed housekeeping, and I'm going to<br/>take a vacation today, and read, write, go visiting, and amuse<br/>myself."<br/><br/>
