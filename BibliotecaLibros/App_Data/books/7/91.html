"Just say I looked pretty well and was having a good time."<br/><br/>"I'll say the first with all my heart, but how about the other?<br/>You don't look as if you were having a good time. Are you?" And<br/>Laurie looked at her with an expression which made her answer in a<br/>whisperâ€¦<br/><br/>"No, not just now. Don't think I'm horrid. I only wanted a<br/>little fun, but this sort doesn't pay, I find, and I'm getting<br/>tired of it."<br/><br/>"Here comes Ned Moffat. What does he want?" said Laurie,<br/>knitting his black brows as if he did not regard his young host in<br/>the light of a pleasant addition to the party.<br/><br/>"He put his name down for three dances, and I suppose he's<br/>coming for them. What a bore!" said Meg, assuming a languid air<br/>which amused Laurie immensely.<br/><br/>He did not speak to her again till suppertime, when he saw her<br/>drinking champagne with Ned and his friend Fisher, who were<br/>behaving 'like a pair of fools', as Laurie said to himself, for he<br/>felt a brotherly sort of right to watch over the Marches and fight<br/>their battles whenever a defender was needed.<br/><br/>"You'll have a splitting headache tomorrow, if you drink much of<br/>that. I wouldn't, Meg, your mother doesn't like it, you know," he<br/>whispered, leaning over her chair, as Ned turned to refill her<br/>glass and Fisher stooped to pick up her fan.<br/><br/>"I'm not Meg tonight, I'm 'a doll' who does all sorts of crazy<br/>things. Tomorrow I shall put away my 'fuss and feathers' and be<br/>desperately good again," she answered with an affected little<br/>laugh.<br/><br/>"Wish tomorrow was here, then," muttered Laurie, walking off,<br/>ill-pleased at the change he saw in her.<br/><br/>Meg danced and flirted, chattered and giggled, as the other<br/>girls did. After supper she undertook the German, and blundered<br/>through it, nearly upsetting her partner with her long skirt, and<br/>romping in a way that scandalized Laurie, who looked on and<br/>meditated a lecture. But he got no chance to deliver it, for Meg<br/>kept away from him till he came to say good night.<br/><br/>"Remember!" she said, trying to smile, for the splitting<br/>headache had already begun.<br/>
