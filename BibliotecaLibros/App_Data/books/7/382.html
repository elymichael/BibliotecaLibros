<br/>"Then I don't feel as if I'd wasted my life. I'm not so good as<br/>you make me, but I have tried to do right. And now, when it's too<br/>late to begin even to do better, it's such a comfort to know that<br/>someone loves me so much, and feels as if I'd helped them."<br/><br/>"More than any one in the world, Beth. I used to think I<br/>couldn't let you go, but I'm learning to feel that I don't lose<br/>you, that you'll be more to me than ever, and death can't part us,<br/>though it seems to."<br/><br/>"I know it cannot, and I don't fear it any longer, for I'm sure<br/>I shall be your Beth still, to love and help you more than ever.<br/>You must take my place, Jo, and be everything to Father and Mother<br/>when I'm gone. They will turn to you, don't fail them, and if it's<br/>hard to work alone, remember that I don't forget you, and that<br/>you'll be happier in doing that than writing splendid books or<br/>seeing all the world, for love is the only thing that we can carry<br/>with us when we go, and it makes the end so easy."<br/><br/>"I'll try, Beth." and then and there Jo renounced her old<br/>ambition, pledged herself to a new and better one, acknowledging<br/>the poverty of other desires, and feeling the blessed solace of a<br/>belief in the immortality of love.<br/><br/>So the spring days came and went, the sky grew clearer, the<br/>earth greener, the flowers were up fairly early, and the birds came<br/>back in time to say goodbye to Beth, who, like a tired but trustful<br/>child, clung to the hands that had led her all her life, as Father<br/>and Mother guided her tenderly through the Valley of the Shadow,<br/>and gave her up to God.<br/><br/>Seldom except in books do the dying utter memorable words, see<br/>visions, or depart with beatified countenances, and those who have<br/>sped many parting souls know that to most the end comes as<br/>naturally and simply as sleep. As Beth had hoped, the 'tide went<br/>out easily', and in the dark hour before dawn, on the bosom where<br/>she had drawn her first breath, she quietly drew her last, with no<br/>farewell but one loving look, one little sigh.<br/><br/>With tears and prayers and tender hands, Mother and sisters made<br/>her ready for the long sleep that pain would never mar again,<br/>seeing with grateful eyes the beautiful serenity that soon replaced<br/>the pathetic patience that had wrung their hearts so long, and<br/>feeling with reverent joy that to their darling death was a<br/>benignant angel, not a phantom full of dread.<br/><br/>When morning came, for the first time in many months the fire<br/>was out, Jo's place was empty, and the room was very still. But a<br/>bird sang blithely on a budding bough, close by, the snowdrops<br/>blossomed freshly at the window, and the spring sunshine streamed<br/>in like a benediction over the placid face upon the pillow, a face<br/>so full of painless peace that those who loved it best smiled<br/>through their tears, and thanked God that Beth was well at<br/>last.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
