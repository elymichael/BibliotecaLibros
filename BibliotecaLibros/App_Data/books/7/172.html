<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>16<br/>Letters<br/><br/><br/>In the cold gray dawn the sisters lit their lamp and read their<br/>chapter with an earnestness never felt before. For now the shadow<br/>of a real trouble had come, the little books were full of help and<br/>comfort, and as they dressed, they agreed to say goodbye cheerfully<br/>and hopefully, and send their mother on her anxious journey<br/>unsaddened by tears or complaints from them. Everything seemed very<br/>strange when they went down, so dim and still outside, so full of<br/>light and bustle within. Breakfast at that early hour seemed odd,<br/>and even Hannah's familiar face looked unnatural as she flew about<br/>her kitchen with her nightcap on. The big trunk stood ready in the<br/>hall, Mother's cloak and bonnet lay on the sofa, and Mother herself<br/>sat trying to eat, but looking so pale and worn with sleeplessness<br/>and anxiety that the girls found it very hard to keep their<br/>resolution. Meg's eyes kept filling in spite of herself, Jo was<br/>obliged to hide her face in the kitchen roller more than once, and<br/>the little girls wore a grave, troubled expression, as if sorrow<br/>was a new experience to them.<br/><br/>Nobody talked much, but as the time drew very near and they sat<br/>waiting for the carriage, Mrs. March said to the girls, who were<br/>all busied about her, one folding her shawl, another smoothing out<br/>the strings of her bonnet, a third putting on her overshoes, and a<br/>fourth fastening up her travelling bagâ€¦<br/><br/>"Children, I leave you to Hannah's care and Mr. Laurence's<br/>protection. Hannah is faithfulness itself, and our good neighbor<br/>will guard you as if you were his own. I have no fears for you, yet<br/>I am anxious that you should take this trouble rightly. Don't<br/>grieve and fret when I am gone, or think that you can be idle and<br/>comfort yourselves by being idle and trying to forget. Go on with<br/>your work as usual, for work is a blessed solace. Hope and keep<br/>busy, and whatever happens, remember that you never can be<br/>fatherless."<br/><br/>"Yes, Mother."<br/><br/>"Meg, dear, be prudent, watch over your sisters, consult Hannah,<br/>and in any perplexity, go to Mr. Laurence. Be patient, Jo, don't<br/>get despondent or do rash things, write to me often, and be my<br/>brave girl, ready to help and cheer all. Beth, comfort yourself<br/>with your music, and be faithful to the little home duties, and<br/>you, Amy, help all you can, be obedient, and keep happy safe at<br/>home."<br/><br/>"We will, Mother! We will!"<br/><br/>The rattle of an approaching carriage made them all start and<br/>listen. That was the hard minute, but the girls stood it well. No<br/>one cried, no one ran away or uttered a lamentation, though their<br/>hearts were very heavy as they sent loving messages to Father,<br/>remembering, as they spoke that it might be too late to deliver<br/>them. They kissed their mother quietly, clung about her tenderly,<br/>and tried to wave their hands cheerfully when she drove away.<br/>
