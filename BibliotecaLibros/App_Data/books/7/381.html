My wild nature more serene,<br/>Give to life new aspirations,<br/>A new trust in the unseen.<br/><br/>Henceforth, safe across the river,<br/>I shall see forever more<br/>A beloved, household spirit<br/>Waiting for me on the shore.<br/>Hope and faith, born of my sorrow,<br/>Guardian angels shall become,<br/>And the sister gone before me<br/>By their hands shall lead me home.<br/><br/><br/>Blurred and blotted, faulty and feeble as the lines were, they<br/>brought a look of inexpressible comfort to Beth's face, for her one<br/>regret had been that she had done so little, and this seemed to<br/>assure her that her life had not been useless, that her death would<br/>not bring the despair she feared. As she sat with the paper folded<br/>between her hands, the charred log fell asunder. Jo started up,<br/>revived the blaze, and crept to the bedside, hoping Beth slept.<br/><br/>"Not asleep, but so happy, dear. See, I found this and read it.<br/>I knew you wouldn't care. Have I been all that to you, Jo?" she<br/>asked, with wistful, humble earnestness.<br/><br/>"<br/>Oh<br/>, Beth, so much, so much!" and Jo's head went down<br/>upon the pillow beside her sister's.<br/>
