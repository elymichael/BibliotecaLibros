"I'll go and tell Amy," said Meg, feeling a little hurt, yet<br/>rather relieved on the whole, for she did not like nursing, and Jo<br/>did.<br/><br/>Amy rebelled outright, and passionately declared that she had<br/>rather have the fever than go to Aunt March. Meg reasoned, pleaded,<br/>and commanded, all in vain. Amy protested that she would not go,<br/>and Meg left her in despair to ask Hannah what should be done.<br/>Before she came back, Laurie walked into the parlor to find Amy<br/>sobbing, with her head in the sofa cushions. She told her story,<br/>expecting to be consoled, but Laurie only put his hands in his<br/>pockets and walked about the room, whistling softly, as he knit his<br/>brows in deep thought. Presently he sat down beside her, and said,<br/>in his most wheedlesome tone, "Now be a sensible little woman, and<br/>do as they say. No, don't cry, but hear what a jolly plan I've got.<br/>You go to Aunt March's, and I'll come and take you out every day,<br/>driving or walking, and we'll have capital times. Won't that be<br/>better than moping here?"<br/><br/>"I don't wish to be sent off as if I was in the way," began Amy,<br/>in an injured voice.<br/><br/>"Bless your heart, child, it's to keep you well. You don't want<br/>to be sick, do you?"<br/><br/>"No, I'm sure I don't, but I dare say I shall be, for I've been<br/>with Beth all the time."<br/><br/>"That's the very reason you ought to go away at once, so that<br/>you may escape it. Change of air and care will keep you well, I<br/>dare say, or if it does not entirely, you will have the fever more<br/>lightly. I advise you to be off as soon as you can, for scarlet<br/>fever is no joke, miss."<br/><br/>"But it's dull at Aunt March's, and she is so cross," said Amy,<br/>looking rather frightened.<br/><br/>"It won't be dull with me popping in every day to tell you how<br/>Beth is, and take you out gallivanting. The old lady likes me, and<br/>I'll be as sweet as possible to her, so she won't peck at us,<br/>whatever we do."<br/><br/>"Will you take me out in the trotting wagon with Puck?"<br/><br/>"On my honor as a gentleman."<br/><br/>"And come every single day?"<br/>
