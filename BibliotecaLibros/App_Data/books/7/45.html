<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>5<br/>Being Neighborly<br/><br/><br/>"What in the world are you going to do now, Jo?" asked Meg one<br/>snowy afternoon, as her sister came tramping through the hall, in<br/>rubber boots, old sack, and hood, with a broom in one hand and a<br/>shovel in the other.<br/><br/>"Going out for exercise," answered Jo with a mischievous twinkle<br/>in her eyes.<br/><br/>"I should think two long walks this morning would have been<br/>enough! It's cold and dull out, and I advise you to stay warm and<br/>dry by the fire, as I do," said Meg with a shiver.<br/><br/>"Never take advice! Can't keep still all day, and not being a<br/>pussycat, I don't like to doze by the fire. I like adventures, and<br/>I'm going to find some."<br/><br/>Meg went back to toast her feet and read&#160;<br/>Ivanhoe<br/>,<br/>and Jo began to dig paths with great energy. The snow was light,<br/>and with her broom she soon swept a path all round the garden, for<br/>Beth to walk in when the sun came out and the invalid dolls needed<br/>air. Now, the garden separated the Marches' house from that of Mr.<br/>Laurence. Both stood in a suburb of the city, which was still<br/>countrylike, with groves and lawns, large gardens, and quiet<br/>streets. A low hedge parted the two estates. On one side was an<br/>old, brown house, looking rather bare and shabby, robbed of the<br/>vines that in summer covered its walls and the flowers, which then<br/>surrounded it. On the other side was a stately stone mansion,<br/>plainly betokening every sort of comfort and luxury, from the big<br/>coach house and well-kept grounds to the conservatory and the<br/>glimpses of lovely things one caught between the rich curtains.<br/><br/>Yet it seemed a lonely, lifeless sort of house, for no children<br/>frolicked on the lawn, no motherly face ever smiled at the windows,<br/>and few people went in and out, except the old gentleman and his<br/>grandson.<br/>
