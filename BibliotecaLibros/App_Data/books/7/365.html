<br/>The two never quarreled. Amy was too well-bred, and just now<br/>Laurie was too lazy, so in a minute he peeped under her hatbrim<br/>with an inquiring air. She answered him with a smile, and they went<br/>on together in the most amicable manner.<br/><br/>It was a lovely drive, along winding roads rich in the<br/>picturesque scenes that delight beauty-loving eyes. Here an ancient<br/>monastery, whence the solemn chanting of the monks came down to<br/>them. There a bare-legged shepherd, in wooden shoes, pointed hat,<br/>and rough jacket over one shoulder, sat piping on a stone while his<br/>goats skipped among the rocks or lay at his feet. Meek,<br/>mouse-colored donkeys, laden with panniers of freshly cut grass<br/>passed by, with a pretty girl in a capaline sitting between the<br/>green piles, or an old woman spinning with a distaff as she went.<br/>Brown, soft-eyed children ran out from the quaint stone hovels to<br/>offer nosegays, or bunches of oranges still on the bough. Gnarled<br/>olive trees covered the hills with their dusky foliage, fruit hung<br/>golden in the orchard, and great scarlet anemones fringed the<br/>roadside, while beyond green slopes and craggy heights, the<br/>Maritime Alps rose sharp and white against the blue Italian<br/>sky.<br/><br/>Valrosa well deserved its name, for in that climate of perpetual<br/>summer roses blossomed everywhere. They overhung the archway,<br/>thrust themselves between the bars of the great gate with a sweet<br/>welcome to passers-by, and lined the avenue, winding through lemon<br/>trees and feathery palms up to the villa on the hill. Every shadowy<br/>nook, where seats invited one to stop and rest, was a mass of<br/>bloom, every cool grotto had its marble nymph smiling from a veil<br/>of flowers and every fountain reflected crimson, white, or pale<br/>pink roses, leaning down to smile at their own beauty. Roses<br/>covered the walls of the house, draped the cornices, climbed the<br/>pillars, and ran riot over the balustrade of the wide terrace,<br/>whence one looked down on the sunny Mediterranean, and the<br/>white-walled city on its shore.<br/><br/>"This is a regular honeymoon paradise, isn't it? Did you ever<br/>see such roses?" asked Amy, pausing on the terrace to enjoy the<br/>view, and a luxurious whiff of perfume that came wandering by.<br/><br/>"No, nor felt such thorns," returned Laurie, with his thumb in<br/>his mouth, after a vain attempt to capture a solitary scarlet<br/>flower that grew just beyond his reach.<br/><br/>"Try lower down, and pick those that have no thorns," said Amy,<br/>gathering three of the tiny cream-colored ones that starred the<br/>wall behind her. She put them in his buttonhole as a peace<br/>offering, and he stood a minute looking down at them with a curious<br/>expression, for in the Italian part of his nature there was a touch<br/>of superstition, and he was just then in that state of half-sweet,<br/>half-bitter melancholy, when imaginative young men find<br/>significance in trifles and food for romance everywhere. He had<br/>thought of Jo in reaching after the thorny red rose, for vivid<br/>flowers became her, and she had often worn ones like that from the<br/>greenhouse at home. The pale roses Amy gave him were the sort that<br/>the Italians lay in dead hands, never in bridal wreaths, and for a<br/>moment he wondered if the omen was for Jo or for himself, but the<br/>next instant his American common sense got the better of<br/>sentimentality, and he laughed a heartier laugh than Amy had heard<br/>since he came.<br/><br/>"It's good advice, you'd better take it and save your fingers,"<br/>she said, thinking her speech amused him.<br/><br/>"Thank you, I will," he answered in jest, and a few months later<br/>he did it in earnest.<br/><br/>"Laurie, when are you going to your grandfather?" she asked<br/>presently, as she settled herself on a rustic seat.<br/><br/>"Very soon."<br/><br/>
