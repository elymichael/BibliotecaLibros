<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>18<br/>Dark Days<br/><br/><br/>Beth did have the fever, and was much sicker than anyone but<br/>Hannah and the doctor suspected. The girls knew nothing about<br/>illness, and Mr. Laurence was not allowed to see her, so Hannah had<br/>everything her own way, and busy Dr. Bangs did his best, but left a<br/>good deal to the excellent nurse. Meg stayed at home, lest she<br/>should infect the Kings, and kept house, feeling very anxious and a<br/>little guilty when she wrote letters in which no mention was made<br/>of Beth's illness. She could not think it right to deceive her<br/>mother, but she had been bidden to mind Hannah, and Hannah wouldn't<br/>hear of 'Mrs. March bein' told, and worried just for sech a<br/>trifle.'<br/><br/>Jo devoted herself to Beth day and night, not a hard task, for<br/>Beth was very patient, and bore her pain uncomplainingly as long as<br/>she could control herself. But there came a time when during the<br/>fever fits she began to talk in a hoarse, broken voice, to play on<br/>the coverlet as if on her beloved little piano, and try to sing<br/>with a throat so swollen that there was no music left, a time when<br/>she did not know the familiar faces around her, but addressed them<br/>by wrong names, and called imploringly for her mother. Then Jo grew<br/>frightened, Meg begged to be allowed to write the truth, and even<br/>Hannah said she 'would think of it, though there was no danger<br/>yet'. A letter from Washington added to their trouble, for Mr.<br/>March had had a relapse, and could not think of coming home for a<br/>long while.<br/><br/>How dark the days seemed now, how sad and lonely the house, and<br/>how heavy were the hearts of the sisters as they worked and waited,<br/>while the shadow of death hovered over the once happy home. Then it<br/>was that Margaret, sitting alone with tears dropping often on her<br/>work, felt how rich she had been in things more precious than any<br/>luxuries money could buyâ€”in love, protection, peace, and health,<br/>the real blessings of life. Then it was that Jo, living in the<br/>darkened room, with that suffering little sister always before her<br/>eyes and that pathetic voice sounding in her ears, learned to see<br/>the beauty and the sweetness of Beth's nature, to feel how deep and<br/>tender a place she filled in all hearts, and to acknowledge the<br/>worth of Beth's unselfish ambition to live for others, and make<br/>home happy by that exercise of those simple virtues which all may<br/>possess, and which all should love and value more than talent,<br/>wealth, or beauty. And Amy, in her exile, longed eagerly to be at<br/>home, that she might work for Beth, feeling now that no service<br/>would be hard or irksome, and remembering, with regretful grief,<br/>how many neglected tasks those willing hands had done for her.<br/>Laurie haunted the house like a restless ghost, and Mr. Laurence<br/>locked the grand piano, because he could not bear to be reminded of<br/>the young neighbor who used to make the twilight pleasant for him.<br/>Everyone missed Beth. The milkman, baker, grocer, and butcher<br/>inquired how she did, poor Mrs. Hummel came to beg pardon for her<br/>thoughtlessness and to get a shroud for Minna, the neighbors sent<br/>all sorts of comforts and good wishes, and even those who knew her<br/>best were surprised to find how many friends shy little Beth had<br/>made.<br/><br/>Meanwhile she lay on her bed with old Joanna at her side, for<br/>even in her wanderings she did not forget her forlorn protege. She<br/>longed for her cats, but would not have them brought, lest they<br/>should get sick, and in her quiet hours she was full of anxiety<br/>about Jo. She sent loving messages to Amy, bade them tell her<br/>mother that she would write soon, and often begged for pencil and<br/>paper to try to say a word, that Father might not think she had<br/>neglected him. But soon even these intervals of consciousness<br/>ended, and she lay hour after hour, tossing to and fro, with<br/>incoherent words on her lips, or sank into a heavy sleep which<br/>brought her no refreshment. Dr. Bangs came twice a day, Hannah sat<br/>up at night, Meg kept a telegram in her desk all ready to send off<br/>at any minute, and Jo never stirred from Beth's side.<br/><br/>The first of December was a wintry day indeed to them, for a<br/>bitter wind blew, snow fell fast, and the year seemed getting ready<br/>for its death. When Dr. Bangs came that morning, he looked long at<br/>Beth, held the hot hand in both his own for a minute, and laid it<br/>gently down, saying, in a low voice to Hannah, "If Mrs. March can<br/>leave her husband she'd better be sent for."<br/><br/>Hannah nodded without speaking, for her lips twitched nervously,<br/>Meg dropped down into a chair as the strength seemed to go out of<br/>her limbs at the sound of those words, and Jo, standing with a pale<br/>face for a minute, ran to the parlor, snatched up the telegram, and<br/>throwing on her things, rushed out into the storm. She was soon<br/>back, and while noiselessly taking off her cloak, Laurie came in<br/>with a letter, saying that Mr. March was mending again. Jo read it<br/>thankfully, but the heavy weight did not seem lifted off her heart,<br/>and her face was so full of misery that Laurie asked quickly, "What<br/>is it? Is Beth worse?"<br/><br/>"I've sent for Mother," said Jo, tugging at her rubber boots<br/>with a tragic expression.<br/>
