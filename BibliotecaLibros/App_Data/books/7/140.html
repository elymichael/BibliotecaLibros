<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>13<br/>Castles in the Air<br/><br/><br/>Laurie lay luxuriously swinging to and fro in his hammock one<br/>warm September afternoon, wondering what his neighbors were about,<br/>but too lazy to go and find out. He was in one of his moods, for<br/>the day had been both unprofitable and unsatisfactory, and he was<br/>wishing he could live it over again. The hot weather made him<br/>indolent, and he had shirked his studies, tried Mr. Brooke's<br/>patience to the utmost, displeased his grandfather by practicing<br/>half the afternoon, frightened the maidservants half out of their<br/>wits by mischievously hinting that one of his dogs was going mad,<br/>and, after high words with the stableman about some fancied neglect<br/>of his horse, he had flung himself into his hammock to fume over<br/>the stupidity of the world in general, till the peace of the lovely<br/>day quieted him in spite of himself. Staring up into the green<br/>gloom of the horse-chestnut trees above him, he dreamed dreams of<br/>all sorts, and was just imagining himself tossing on the ocean in a<br/>voyage round the world, when the sound of voices brought him ashore<br/>in a flash. Peeping through the meshes of the hammock, he saw the<br/>Marches coming out, as if bound on some expedition.<br/><br/>"What in the world are those girls about now?" thought Laurie,<br/>opening his sleepy eyes to take a good look, for there was<br/>something rather peculiar in the appearance of his neighbors. Each<br/>wore a large, flapping hat, a brown linen pouch slung over one<br/>shoulder, and carried a long staff. Meg had a cushion, Jo a book,<br/>Beth a basket, and Amy a portfolio. All walked quietly through the<br/>garden, out at the little back gate, and began to climb the hill<br/>that lay between the house and river.<br/><br/>"Well, that's cool," said Laurie to himself, "to have a picnic<br/>and never ask me! They can't be going in the boat, for they haven't<br/>got the key. Perhaps they forgot it. I'll take it to them, and see<br/>what's going on."<br/><br/>Though possessed of half a dozen hats, it took him some time to<br/>find one, then there was a hunt for the key, which was at last<br/>discovered in his pocket, so that the girls were quite out of sight<br/>when he leaped the fence and ran after them. Taking the shortest<br/>way to the boathouse, he waited for them to appear, but no one<br/>came, and he went up the hill to take an observation. A grove of<br/>pines covered one part of it, and from the heart of this green spot<br/>came a clearer sound than the soft sigh of the pines or the drowsy<br/>chirp of the crickets.<br/><br/>"Here's a landscape!" thought Laurie, peeping through the<br/>bushes, and looking wide-awake and good-natured already.<br/><br/>It was a rather pretty little picture, for the sisters sat<br/>together in the shady nook, with sun and shadow flickering over<br/>them, the aromatic wind lifting their hair and cooling their hot<br/>cheeks, and all the little wood people going on with their affairs<br/>as if these were no strangers but old friends. Meg sat upon her<br/>cushion, sewing daintily with her white hands, and looking as fresh<br/>and sweet as a rose in her pink dress among the green. Beth was<br/>sorting the cones that lay thick under the hemlock near by, for she<br/>made pretty things with them. Amy was sketching a group of ferns,<br/>and Jo was knitting as she read aloud. A shadow passed over the<br/>boy's face as he watched them, feeling that he ought to go away<br/>because uninvited; yet lingering because home seemed very lonely<br/>and this quiet party in the woods most attractive to his restless<br/>spirit. He stood so still that a squirrel, busy with its<br/>harvesting, ran down a pine close beside him, saw him suddenly and<br/>skipped back, scolding so shrilly that Beth looked up, espied the<br/>wistful face behind the birches, and beckoned with a reassuring<br/>smile.<br/><br/>"May I come in, please? Or shall I be a bother?" he asked,<br/>advancing slowly.<br/>
