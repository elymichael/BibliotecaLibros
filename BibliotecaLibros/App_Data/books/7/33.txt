Jo thanked him and gladly went, wishing she had two neat gloves
when she saw the nice, pearl-colored ones her partner wore. The
hall was empty, and they had a grand polka, for Laurie danced well,
and taught her the German step, which delighted Jo, being full of
swing and spring. When the music stopped, they sat down on the
stairs to get their breath, and Laurie was in the midst of an
account of a students' festival at Heidelberg when Meg appeared in
search of her sister. She beckoned, and Jo reluctantly followed her
into a side room, where she found her on a sofa, holding her foot,
and looking pale.

"I've sprained my ankle. That stupid high heel turned and gave
me a sad wrench. It aches so, I can hardly stand, and I don't know
how I'm ever going to get home," she said, rocking to and fro in
pain.

"I knew you'd hurt your feet with those silly shoes. I'm sorry.
But I don't see what you can do, except get a carriage, or stay
here all night," answered Jo, softly rubbing the poor ankle as she
spoke.

"I can't have a carriage without its costing ever so much. I
dare say I can't get one at all, for most people come in their own,
and it's a long way to the stable, and no one to send."

"I'll go."

"No, indeed! It's past nine, and dark as Egypt. I can't stop
here, for the house is full. Sallie has some girls staying with
her. I'll rest till Hannah comes, and then do the best I can."

"I'll ask Laurie. He will go," said Jo, looking relieved as the
idea occurred to her.

"Mercy, no! Don't ask or tell anyone. Get me my rubbers, and put
these slippers with our things. I can't dance anymore, but as soon
as supper is over, watch for Hannah and tell me the minute she
comes."

"They are going out to supper now. I'll stay with you. I'd
rather."

"No, dear, run along, and bring me some coffee. I'm so tired I
can't stir."
