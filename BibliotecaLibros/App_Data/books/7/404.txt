Nobody knew where the evening went to, for Hannah skillfully
abstracted the babies at an early hour, nodding like two rosy
poppies, and Mr. Laurence went home to rest. The others sat round
the fire, talking away, utterly regardless of the lapse of time,
till Meg, whose maternal mind was impressed with a firm conviction
that Daisy had tumbled out of bed, and Demi set his nightgown afire
studying the structure of matches, made a move to go.

"We must have our sing, in the good old way, for we are all
together again once more," said Jo, feeling that a good shout would
be a safe and pleasant vent for the jubilant emotions of her
soul.

They were not all there. But no one found the words thougtless
or untrue, for Beth still seemed among them, a peaceful presence,
invisible, but dearer than ever, since death could not break the
household league that love made disoluble. The little chair stood
in its old place. The tidy basket, with the bit of work she left
unfinished when the needle grew 'so heavy', was still on its
accustomed shelf. The beloved instrument, seldom touched now had
not been moved, and above it Beth's face, serene and smiling, as in
the early days, looked down upon them, seeming to say, "Be happy. I
am here."

"Play something, Amy. Let them hear how much you have improved,"
said Laurie, with pardonable pride in his promising pupil.

But Amy whispered, with full eyes, as she twirled the faded
stool, "Not tonight, dear. I can't show off tonight."

But she did show something better than brilliancy or skill, for
she sang Beth's songs with a tender music in her voice which the
best master could not have taught, and touched the listener's
hearts with a sweeter power than any other inspiration could have
given her. The room was very still, when the clear voice failed
suddenly at the last line of Beth's favorite hymn. It was hard to
say…


Earth hath no sorrow that heaven cannot heal;


and Amy leaned against her husband, who stood
behind her, feeling that her welcome home was not quite perfect
without Beth's kiss.

"Now, we must finish with Mignon's song, for Mr. Bhaer sings
that," said Jo, before the pause grew painful. And Mr. Bhaer
cleared his throat with a gratified "Hem!" as he stepped into the
corner where Jo stood, saying…

"You will sing with me? We go excellently well together."
