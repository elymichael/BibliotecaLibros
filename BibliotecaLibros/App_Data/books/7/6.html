Undine and Sintran<br/>&#160;for<br/>myself. I've wanted it so long," said Jo, who was a bookworm.<br/><br/>"I planned to spend mine in new music," said Beth, with a little<br/>sigh, which no one heard but the hearth brush and<br/>kettle-holder.<br/><br/>"I shall get a nice box of Faber's drawing pencils; I really<br/>need them," said Amy decidedly.<br/><br/>"Mother didn't say anything about our money, and she won't wish<br/>us to give up everything. Let's each buy what we want, and have a<br/>little fun; I'm sure we work hard enough to earn it," cried Jo,<br/>examining the heels of her shoes in a gentlemanly manner.<br/><br/>"I know I doâ€”teaching those tiresome children nearly all day,<br/>when I'm longing to enjoy myself at home," began Meg, in the<br/>complaining tone again.<br/><br/>"You don't have half such a hard time as I do," said Jo. "How<br/>would you like to be shut up for hours with a nervous, fussy old<br/>lady, who keeps you trotting, is never satisfied, and worries you<br/>till you're ready to fly out the window or cry?"<br/><br/>"It's naughty to fret, but I do think washing dishes and keeping<br/>things tidy is the worst work in the world. It makes me cross, and<br/>my hands get so stiff, I can't practice well at all." And Beth<br/>looked at her rough hands with a sigh that any one could hear that<br/>time.<br/><br/>"I don't believe any of you suffer as I do," cried Amy, "for you<br/>don't have to go to school with impertinent girls, who plague you<br/>if you don't know your lessons, and laugh at your dresses, and<br/>label your father if he isn't rich, and insult you when your nose<br/>isn't nice."<br/><br/>"If you mean libel, I'd say so, and not talk about labels, as if<br/>Papa was a pickle bottle," advised Jo, laughing.<br/><br/>"I know what I mean, and you needn't be statirical about it.<br/>It's proper to use good words, and improve your vocabilary,"<br/>returned Amy, with dignity.<br/><br/>
