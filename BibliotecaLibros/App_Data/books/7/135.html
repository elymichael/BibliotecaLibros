There was a queer smile about Mr. Brooke's mouth as he opened at<br/>poor Mary's lament.<br/><br/>Meg obediently following the long grass-blade which her new<br/>tutor used to point with, read slowly and timidly, unconsciously<br/>making poetry of the hard words by the soft intonation of her<br/>musical voice. Down the page went the green guide, and presently,<br/>forgetting her listener in the beauty of the sad scene, Meg read as<br/>if alone, giving a little touch of tragedy to the words of the<br/>unhappy queen. If she had seen the brown eyes then, she would have<br/>stopped short, but she never looked up, and the lesson was not<br/>spoiled for her.<br/><br/>"Very well indeed!" said Mr. Brooke, as she paused, quite<br/>ignoring her many mistakes, and looking as if he did indeed love to<br/>teach.<br/><br/>Miss Kate put up her glass, and, having taken a survey of the<br/>little tableau before her, shut her sketch book, saying with<br/>condescension, "You've a nice accent and in time will be a clever<br/>reader. I advise you to learn, for German is a valuable<br/>accomplishment to teachers. I must look after Grace, she is<br/>romping." And Miss Kate strolled away, adding to herself with a<br/>shrug, "I didn't come to chaperone a governess, though she is young<br/>and pretty. What odd people these Yankees are. I'm afraid Laurie<br/>will be quite spoiled among them."<br/><br/>"I forgot that English people rather turn up their noses at<br/>governesses and don't treat them as we do," said Meg, looking after<br/>the retreating figure with an annoyed expression.<br/><br/>"Tutors also have rather a hard time of it there, as I know to<br/>my sorrow. There's no place like America for us workers, Miss<br/>Margaret." And Mr. Brooke looked so contented and cheerful that Meg<br/>was ashamed to lament her hard lot.<br/><br/>"I'm glad I live in it then. I don't like my work, but I get a<br/>good deal of satisfaction out of it after all, so I won't complain.<br/>I only wished I liked teaching as you do."<br/><br/>"I think you would if you had Laurie for a pupil. I shall be<br/>very sorry to lose him next year," said Mr. Brooke, busily punching<br/>holes in the turf.<br/><br/>"Going to college, I suppose?" Meg's lips asked the question,<br/>but her eyes added, "And what becomes of you?"<br/><br/>"Yes, it's high time he went, for he is ready, and as soon as he<br/>is off, I shall turn soldier. I am needed."<br/><br/>"I am glad of that!" exclaimed Meg. "I should think every young<br/>man would want to go, though it is hard for the mothers and sisters<br/>who stay at home," she added sorrowfully.<br/>
