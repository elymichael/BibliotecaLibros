<br/>"They needn't see or speak to anyone, but run in at any time.<br/>For I'm shut up in my study at the other end of the house, Laurie<br/>is out a great deal, and the servants are never near the drawing<br/>room after nine o'clock."<br/><br/>Here he rose, as if going, and Beth made up her mind to speak,<br/>for that last arrangement left nothing to be desired. "Please, tell<br/>the young ladies what I say, and if they don't care to come, why,<br/>never mind." Here a little hand slipped into his, and Beth looked<br/>up at him with a face full of gratitude, as she said, in her<br/>earnest yet timid way…<br/><br/>"Oh sir, they do care, very very much!"<br/><br/>"Are you the musical girl?" he asked, without any startling<br/>"Hey!" as he looked down at her very kindly.<br/><br/>"I'm Beth. I love it dearly, and I'll come, if you are quite<br/>sure nobody will hear me, and be disturbed," she added, fearing to<br/>be rude, and trembling at her own boldness as she spoke.<br/><br/>"Not a soul, my dear. The house is empty half the day, so come<br/>and drum away as much as you like, and I shall be obliged to<br/>you."<br/><br/>"How kind you are, sir!"<br/><br/>Beth blushed like a rose under the friendly look he wore, but<br/>she was not frightened now, and gave the hand a grateful squeeze<br/>because she had no words to thank him for the precious gift he had<br/>given her. The old gentleman softly stroked the hair off her<br/>forehead, and, stooping down, he kissed her, saying, in a tone few<br/>people ever heard…<br/><br/>"I had a little girl once, with eyes like these. God bless you,<br/>my dear! Good day, madam." And away he went, in a great hurry.<br/><br/>Beth had a rapture with her mother, and then rushed up to impart<br/>the glorious news to her family of invalids, as the girls were not<br/>home. How blithely she sang that evening, and how they all laughed<br/>at her because she woke Amy in the night by playing the piano on<br/>her face in her sleep. Next day, having seen both the old and young<br/>gentleman out of the house, Beth, after two or three retreats,<br/>fairly got in at the side door, and made her way as noiselessly as<br/>any mouse to the drawing room where her idol stood. Quite by<br/>accident, of course, some pretty, easy music lay on the piano, and<br/>with trembling fingers and frequent stops to listen and look about,<br/>Beth at last touched the great instrument, and straightway forgot<br/>her fear, herself, and everything else but the unspeakable delight<br/>which the music gave her, for it was like the voice of a beloved<br/>friend.<br/><br/>
