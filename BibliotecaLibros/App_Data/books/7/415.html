<br/>Aunt Dodo was chief playmate and confidante of both children,<br/>and the trio turned the little house topsy-turvy. Aunt Amy was as<br/>yet only a name to them, Aunt Beth soon faded into a pleasantly<br/>vague memory, but Aunt Dodo was a living reality, and they made the<br/>most of her, for which compliment she was deeply grateful. But when<br/>Mr. Bhaer came, Jo neglected her playfellows, and dismay and<br/>desolation fell upon their little souls. Daisy, who was fond of<br/>going about peddling kisses, lost her best customer and became<br/>bankrupt. Demi, with infantile penetration, soon discovered that<br/>Dodo like to play with 'the bear-man' better than she did him, but<br/>though hurt, he concealed his anguish, for he hadn't the heart to<br/>insult a rival who kept a mine of chocolate drops in his waistcoat<br/>pocket, and a watch that could be taken out of its case and freely<br/>shaken by ardent admirers.<br/><br/>Some persons might have considered these pleasing liberties as<br/>bribes, but Demi didn't see it in that light, and continued to<br/>patronize the 'the bear-man' with pensive affability, while Daisy<br/>bestowed her small affections upon him at the third call, and<br/>considered his shoulder her throne, his arm her refuge, his gifts<br/>treasures surpassing worth.<br/><br/>Gentlemen are sometimes seized with sudden fits of admiration<br/>for the young relatives of ladies whom they honor with their<br/>regard, but this counterfeit philoprogenitiveness sits uneasily<br/>upon them, and does not deceive anybody a particle. Mr. Bhaer's<br/>devotion was sincere, however likewise effective—for honesty is the<br/>best policy in love as in law. He was one of the men who are at<br/>home with children, and looked particularly well when little faces<br/>made a pleasant contrast with his manly one. His business, whatever<br/>it was, detained him from day to day, but evening seldom failed to<br/>bring him out to see—well, he always asked for Mr. March, so I<br/>suppose he was the attraction. The excellent papa labored under the<br/>delusion that he was, and reveled in long discussions with the<br/>kindred spirit, till a chance remark of his more observing grandson<br/>suddenly enlightened him.<br/><br/>Mr. Bhaer came in one evening to pause on the threshold of the<br/>study, astonished by the spectacle that met his eye. Prone upon the<br/>floor lay Mr. March, with his respectable legs in the air, and<br/>beside him, likewise prone, was Demi, trying to imitate the<br/>attitude with his own short, scarlet-stockinged legs, both<br/>grovelers so seriously absorbed that they were unconscious of<br/>spectators, till Mr. Bhaer laughed his sonorous laugh, and Jo cried<br/>out, with a scandalized face…<br/><br/>"Father, Father, here's the Professor!"<br/><br/>Down went the black legs and up came the gray head, as the<br/>preceptor said, with undisturbed dignity, "Good evening, Mr. Bhaer.<br/>Excuse me for a moment. We are just finishing our lesson. Now,<br/>Demi, make the letter and tell its name."<br/><br/>"I knows him!" and, after a few convulsive efforts, the red legs<br/>took the shape of a pair of compasses, and the intelligent pupil<br/>triumphantly shouted, "It's a We, Dranpa, it's a We!"<br/><br/>"He's a born Weller," laughed Jo, as her parent gathered himself<br/>up, and her nephew tried to stand on his head, as the only mode of<br/>expressing his satisfaction that school was over.<br/><br/>"What have you been at today, bubchen?" asked Mr. Bhaer, picking<br/>up the gymnast.<br/><br/>"Me went to see little Mary."<br/><br/>
