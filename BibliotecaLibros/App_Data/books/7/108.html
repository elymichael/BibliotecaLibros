<br/>Meg—Good.<br/><br/>Jo—Bad.<br/><br/>Beth—Very Good.<br/><br/>Amy—Middling.<br/><br/>_________________________________________________<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>As the President finished reading the paper (which I beg leave<br/>to assure my readers is a bona fide copy of one written by bona<br/>fide girls once upon a time), a round of applause followed, and<br/>then Mr. Snodgrass rose to make a proposition.<br/><br/>"Mr. President and gentlemen," he began, assuming a<br/>parliamentary attitude and tone, "I wish to propose the admission<br/>of a new member—one who highly deserves the honor, would be deeply<br/>grateful for it, and would add immensely to the spirit of the club,<br/>the literary value of the paper, and be no end jolly and nice. I<br/>propose Mr. Theodore Laurence as an honorary member of the P. C.<br/>Come now, do have him."<br/><br/>Jo's sudden change of tone made the girls laugh, but all looked<br/>rather anxious, and no one said a word as Snodgrass took his<br/>seat.<br/><br/>"We'll put it to a vote," said the President. "All in favor of<br/>this motion please to manifest it by saying, 'Aye'."<br/>
