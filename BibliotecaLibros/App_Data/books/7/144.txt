Something in the boy's face troubled his little friend, but she
said cheerfully, with her quiet eyes on the changing clouds, "If
people really want to go, and really try all their lives, I think
they will get in, for I don't believe there are any locks on that
door or any guards at the gate. I always imagine it is as it is in
the picture, where the shining ones stretch out their hands to
welcome poor Christian as he comes up from the river."

"Wouldn't it be fun if all the castles in the air which we make
could come true, and we could live in them?" said Jo, after a
little pause.

"I've made such quantities it would be hard to choose which I'd
have," said Laurie, lying flat and throwing cones at the squirrel
who had betrayed him.

"You'd have to take your favorite one. What is it?" asked
Meg.

"If I tell mine, will you tell yours?"

"Yes, if the girls will too."

"We will. Now, Laurie."

"After I'd seen as much of the world as I want to, I'd like to
settle in Germany and have just as much music as I choose. I'm to
be a famous musician myself, and all creation is to rush to hear
me. And I'm never to be bothered about money or business, but just
enjoy myself and live for what I like. That's my favorite castle.
What's yours, Meg?"

Margaret seemed to find it a little hard to tell hers, and waved
a brake before her face, as if to disperse imaginary gnats, while
she said slowly, "I should like a lovely house, full of all sorts
of luxurious thingsâ€”nice food, pretty clothes, handsome furniture,
pleasant people, and heaps of money. I am to be mistress of it, and
manage it as I like, with plenty of servants, so I never need work
a bit. How I should enjoy it! For I wouldn't be idle, but do good,
and make everyone love me dearly."

"Wouldn't you have a master for your castle in the air?" asked
Laurie slyly.

"I said 'pleasant people', you know," and Meg carefully tied up
her shoe as she spoke, so that no one saw her face.
