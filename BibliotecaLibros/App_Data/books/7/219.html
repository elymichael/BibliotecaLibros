<br/>"I'm sorry for that, and ought to thank him for not shaking me,<br/>I suppose. What the dickens does the fellow expect?" and the old<br/>gentleman looked a trifle ashamed of his own testiness.<br/><br/>"If I were you, I'd write him an apology, Sir. He says he won't<br/>come down till he has one, and talks about Washington, and goes on<br/>in an absurd way. A formal apology will make him see how foolish he<br/>is, and bring him down quite amiable. Try it. He likes fun, and<br/>this way is better than talking. I'll carry it up, and teach him<br/>his duty."<br/><br/>Mr. Laurence gave her a sharp look, and put on his spectacles,<br/>saying slowly, "You're a sly puss, but I don't mind being managed<br/>by you and Beth. Here, give me a bit of paper, and let us have done<br/>with this nonsense."<br/><br/>The note was written in the terms which one gentleman would use<br/>to another after offering some deep insult. Jo dropped a kiss on<br/>the top of Mr. Laurence's bald head, and ran up to slip the apology<br/>under Laurie's door, advising him through the keyhole to be<br/>submissive, decorous, and a few other agreeable impossibilities.<br/>Finding the door locked again, she left the note to do its work,<br/>and was going quietly away, when the young gentleman slid down the<br/>banisters, and waited for her at the bottom, saying, with his most<br/>virtuous expression of countenance, "What a good fellow you are,<br/>Jo! Did you get blown up?" he added, laughing.<br/><br/>"No, he was pretty mild, on the whole."<br/><br/>"Ah! I got it all round. Even you cast me off over there, and I<br/>felt just ready to go to the deuce," he began apologetically.<br/><br/>"Don't talk that way, turn over a new leaf and begin again,<br/>Teddy, my son."<br/><br/>"I keep turning over new leaves, and spoiling them, as I used to<br/>spoil my copybooks, and I make so many beginnings there never will<br/>be an end," he said dolefully.<br/><br/>"Go and eat your dinner, you'll feel better after it. Men always<br/>croak when they are hungry," and Jo whisked out at the front door<br/>after that.<br/><br/>"That's a 'label' on my 'sect'," answered Laurie, quoting Amy,<br/>as he went to partake of humble pie dutifully with his grandfather,<br/>who was quite saintly in temper and overwhelmingly respectful in<br/>manner all the rest of the day.<br/><br/>
