"What has that boy been about? Don't try to shield him. I know
he has been in mischief by the way he acted when he came home. I
can't get a word from him, and when I threatened to shake the truth
out of him he bolted upstairs and locked himself into his
room."

"He did wrong, but we forgave him, and all promised not to say a
word to anyone," began Jo reluctantly.

"That won't do. He shall not shelter himself behind a promise
from you softhearted girls. If he's done anything amiss, he shall
confess, beg pardon, and be punished. Out with it, Jo. I won't be
kept in the dark."

Mr. Laurence looked so alarming and spoke so sharply that Jo
would have gladly run away, if she could, but she was perched aloft
on the steps, and he stood at the foot, a lion in the path, so she
had to stay and brave it out.

"Indeed, Sir, I cannot tell. Mother forbade it. Laurie has
confessed, asked pardon, and been punished quite enough. We don't
keep silence to shield him, but someone else, and it will make more
trouble if you interfere. Please don't. It was partly my fault, but
it's all right now. So let's forget it, and talk about
the&#160;
Rambler
&#160;or something pleasant."

"Hang the&#160;
Rambler!
&#160;Come down and give me your
word that this harum-scarum boy of mine hasn't done anything
ungrateful or impertinent. If he has, after all your kindness to
him, I'll thrash him with my own hands."

The threat sounded awful, but did not alarm Jo, for she knew the
irascible old gentleman would never lift a finger against his
grandson, whatever he might say to the contrary. She obediently
descended, and made as light of the prank as she could without
betraying Meg or forgetting the truth.

"Hum… ha… well, if the boy held his tongue because he promised,
and not from obstinacy, I'll forgive him. He's a stubborn fellow
and hard to manage," said Mr. Laurence, rubbing up his hair till it
looked as if he had been out in a gale, and smoothing the frown
from his brow with an air of relief.
