It did not seem at all comical to Meg, who kissed and caressed<br/>the afflicted heroine in the tenderest manner.<br/><br/>"I'm not sorry," protested Jo, with a choke. "I'd do it again<br/>tomorrow, if I could. It's only the vain part of me that goes and<br/>cries in this silly way. Don't tell anyone, it's all over now. I<br/>thought you were asleep, so I just made a little private moan for<br/>my one beauty. How came you to be awake?"<br/><br/>"I can't sleep, I'm so anxious," said Meg.<br/><br/>"Think about something pleasant, and you'll soon drop off."<br/><br/>"I tried it, but felt wider awake than ever."<br/><br/>"What did you think of?"<br/><br/>"Handsome facesâ€”eyes particularly," answered Meg, smiling to<br/>herself in the dark.<br/><br/>"What color do you like best?"<br/><br/>"Brown, that is, sometimes. Blue are lovely."<br/><br/>Jo laughed, and Meg sharply ordered her not to talk, then<br/>amiably promised to make her hair curl, and fell asleep to dream of<br/>living in her castle in the air.<br/><br/>The clocks were striking midnight and the rooms were very still<br/>as a figure glided quietly from bed to bed, smoothing a coverlet<br/>here, settling a pillow there, and pausing to look long and<br/>tenderly at each unconscious face, to kiss each with lips that<br/>mutely blessed, and to pray the fervent prayers which only mothers<br/>utter. As she lifted the curtain to look out into the dreary night,<br/>the moon broke suddenly from behind the clouds and shone upon her<br/>like a bright, benignant face, which seemed to whisper in the<br/>silence, "Be comforted, dear soul! There is always light behind the<br/>clouds."<br/>
