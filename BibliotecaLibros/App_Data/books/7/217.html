<br/>"What has that boy been about? Don't try to shield him. I know<br/>he has been in mischief by the way he acted when he came home. I<br/>can't get a word from him, and when I threatened to shake the truth<br/>out of him he bolted upstairs and locked himself into his<br/>room."<br/><br/>"He did wrong, but we forgave him, and all promised not to say a<br/>word to anyone," began Jo reluctantly.<br/><br/>"That won't do. He shall not shelter himself behind a promise<br/>from you softhearted girls. If he's done anything amiss, he shall<br/>confess, beg pardon, and be punished. Out with it, Jo. I won't be<br/>kept in the dark."<br/><br/>Mr. Laurence looked so alarming and spoke so sharply that Jo<br/>would have gladly run away, if she could, but she was perched aloft<br/>on the steps, and he stood at the foot, a lion in the path, so she<br/>had to stay and brave it out.<br/><br/>"Indeed, Sir, I cannot tell. Mother forbade it. Laurie has<br/>confessed, asked pardon, and been punished quite enough. We don't<br/>keep silence to shield him, but someone else, and it will make more<br/>trouble if you interfere. Please don't. It was partly my fault, but<br/>it's all right now. So let's forget it, and talk about<br/>the&#160;<br/>Rambler<br/>&#160;or something pleasant."<br/><br/>"Hang the&#160;<br/>Rambler!<br/>&#160;Come down and give me your<br/>word that this harum-scarum boy of mine hasn't done anything<br/>ungrateful or impertinent. If he has, after all your kindness to<br/>him, I'll thrash him with my own hands."<br/><br/>The threat sounded awful, but did not alarm Jo, for she knew the<br/>irascible old gentleman would never lift a finger against his<br/>grandson, whatever he might say to the contrary. She obediently<br/>descended, and made as light of the prank as she could without<br/>betraying Meg or forgetting the truth.<br/><br/>"Hum… ha… well, if the boy held his tongue because he promised,<br/>and not from obstinacy, I'll forgive him. He's a stubborn fellow<br/>and hard to manage," said Mr. Laurence, rubbing up his hair till it<br/>looked as if he had been out in a gale, and smoothing the frown<br/>from his brow with an air of relief.<br/><br/>
