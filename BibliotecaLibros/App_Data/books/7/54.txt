"Just her father's way of doing good. I shall come and see your
mother some fine day. Tell her so. There's the tea bell, we have it
early on the boy's account. Come down and go on being
neighborly."

"If you'd like to have me, sir."

"Shouldn't ask you, if I didn't." And Mr. Laurence offered her
his arm with old-fashioned courtesy.

"What would Meg say to this?" thought Jo, as she was marched
away, while her eyes danced with fun as she imagined herself
telling the story at home.

"Hey! Why, what the dickens has come to the fellow?" said the
old gentleman, as Laurie came running downstairs and brought up
with a start of surprise at the astounding sight of Jo arm in arm
with his redoubtable grandfather.

"I didn't know you'd come, sir," he began, as Jo gave him a
triumphant little glance.

"That's evident, by the way you racket downstairs. Come to your
tea, sir, and behave like a gentleman." And having pulled the boy's
hair by way of a caress, Mr. Laurence walked on, while Laurie went
through a series of comic evolutions behind their backs, which
nearly produced an explosion of laughter from Jo.

The old gentleman did not say much as he drank his four cups of
tea, but he watched the young people, who soon chatted away like
old friends, and the change in his grandson did not escape him.
There was color, light, and life in the boy's face now, vivacity in
his manner, and genuine merriment in his laugh.

"She's right, the lad is lonely. I'll see what these little
girls can do for him," thought Mr. Laurence, as he looked and
listened. He liked Jo, for her odd, blunt ways suited him, and she
seemed to understand the boy almost as well as if she had been one
herself.

If the Laurences had been what Jo called 'prim and poky', she
would not have got on at all, for such people always made her shy
and awkward. But finding them free and easy, she was so herself,
and made a good impression. When they rose she proposed to go, but
Laurie said he had something more to show her, and took her away to
the conservatory, which had been lighted for her benefit. It seemed
quite fairylike to Jo, as she went up and down the walks, enjoying
the blooming walls on either side, the soft light, the damp sweet
air, and the wonderful vines and trees that hung about her, while
her new friend cut the finest flowers till his hands were full.
Then he tied them up, saying, with the happy look Jo liked to see,
"Please give these to your mother, and tell her I like the medicine
she sent me very much."
