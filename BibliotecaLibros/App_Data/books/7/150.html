<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>14<br/>Secrets<br/><br/><br/>Jo was very busy in the garret, for the October days began to<br/>grow chilly, and the afternoons were short. For two or three hours<br/>the sun lay warmly in the high window, showing Jo seated on the old<br/>sofa, writing busily, with her papers spread out upon a trunk<br/>before her, while Scrabble, the pet rat, promenaded the beams<br/>overhead, accompanied by his oldest son, a fine young fellow, who<br/>was evidently very proud of his whiskers. Quite absorbed in her<br/>work, Jo scribbled away till the last page was filled, when she<br/>signed her name with a flourish and threw down her pen,<br/>exclaimingâ€¦<br/><br/>"There, I've done my best! If this won't suit I shall have to<br/>wait till I can do better."<br/><br/>Lying back on the sofa, she read the manuscript carefully<br/>through, making dashes here and there, and putting in many<br/>exclamation points, which looked like little balloons. Then she<br/>tied it up with a smart red ribbon, and sat a minute looking at it<br/>with a sober, wistful expression, which plainly showed how earnest<br/>her work had been. Jo's desk up here was an old tin kitchen which<br/>hung against the wall. In it she kept her papers, and a few books,<br/>safely shut away from Scrabble, who, being likewise of a literary<br/>turn, was fond of making a circulating library of such books as<br/>were left in his way by eating the leaves. From this tin receptacle<br/>Jo produced another manuscript, and putting both in her pocket,<br/>crept quietly downstairs, leaving her friends to nibble on her pens<br/>and taste her ink.<br/><br/>She put on her hat and jacket as noiselessly as possible, and<br/>going to the back entry window, got out upon the roof of a low<br/>porch, swung herself down to the grassy bank, and took a roundabout<br/>way to the road. Once there, she composed herself, hailed a passing<br/>omnibus, and rolled away to town, looking very merry and<br/>mysterious.<br/><br/>If anyone had been watching her, he would have thought her<br/>movements decidedly peculiar, for on alighting, she went off at a<br/>great pace till she reached a certain number in a certain busy<br/>street. Having found the place with some difficulty, she went into<br/>the doorway, looked up the dirty stairs, and after standing stock<br/>still a minute, suddenly dived into the street and walked away as<br/>rapidly as she came. This maneuver she repeated several times, to<br/>the great amusement of a black-eyed young gentleman lounging in the<br/>window of a building opposite. On returning for the third time, Jo<br/>gave herself a shake, pulled her hat over her eyes, and walked up<br/>the stairs, looking as if she were going to have all her teeth<br/>out.<br/><br/>There was a dentist's sign, among others, which adorned the<br/>entrance, and after staring a moment at the pair of artificial jaws<br/>which slowly opened and shut to draw attention to a fine set of<br/>teeth, the young gentleman put on his coat, took his hat, and went<br/>down to post himself in the opposite doorway, saying with a smile<br/>and a shiver, "It's like her to come alone, but if she has a bad<br/>time she'll need someone to help her home."<br/><br/>In ten minutes Jo came running downstairs with a very red face<br/>and the general appearance of a person who had just passed through<br/>a trying ordeal of some sort. When she saw the young gentleman she<br/>looked anything but pleased, and passed him with a nod. But he<br/>followed, asking with an air of sympathy, "Did you have a bad<br/>time?"<br/>
