<br/>"Can't wait, and I'm afraid I haven't much faith in ink and<br/>dirt, though I'm grateful for your good intentions."<br/><br/>Meg sighed, and turned to the frostbitten garden again. Jo<br/>groaned and leaned both elbows on the table in a despondent<br/>attitude, but Amy spatted away energetically, and Beth, who sat at<br/>the other window, said, smiling, "Two pleasant things are going to<br/>happen right away. Marmee is coming down the street, and Laurie is<br/>tramping through the garden as if he had something nice to<br/>tell."<br/><br/>In they both came, Mrs. March with her usual question, "Any<br/>letter from Father, girls?" and Laurie to say in his persuasive<br/>way, "Won't some of you come for a drive? I've been working away at<br/>mathematics till my head is in a muddle, and I'm going to freshen<br/>my wits by a brisk turn. It's a dull day, but the air isn't bad,<br/>and I'm going to take Brooke home, so it will be gay inside, if it<br/>isn't out.

And Meg whisked out her<br/>workbasket, for she had agreed with her mother that it was best,<br/>for her at least, not to drive too often with the young<br/>gentleman.<br/><br/>"We three will be ready in a minute," cried Amy, running away to<br/>wash her hands.<br/><br/>"Can I do anything for you, Madam Mother?" asked Laurie, leaning<br/>over Mrs. March's chair with the affectionate look and tone he<br/>always gave her.<br/><br/>"No, thank you, except call at the office, if you'll be so kind,<br/>dear. It's our day for a letter, and the postman hasn't been.<br/>Father is as regular as the sun, but there's some delay on the way,<br/>perhaps."<br/><br/>A sharp ring interrupted her, and a minute after Hannah came in<br/>with a letter.<br/><br/>"It's one of them horrid telegraph things, mum," she said,<br/>handling it as if she was afraid it would explode and do some<br/>damage.<br/><br/>
