"I know I have no right to talk so to you, Laurie, and if you<br/>weren't the sweetest-tempered fellow in the world, you'd be very<br/>angry with me. But we are all so fond and proud of you, I couldn't<br/>bear to think they should be disappointed in you at home as I have<br/>been, though, perhaps they would understand the change better than<br/>I do."<br/><br/>"I think they would," came from under the hat, in a grim tone,<br/>quite as touching as a broken one.<br/><br/>"They ought to have told me, and not let me go blundering and<br/>scolding, when I should have been more kind and patient than ever.<br/>I never did like that Miss Randal and now I hate her!" said artful<br/>Amy, wishing to be sure of her facts this time.<br/><br/>"Hang Miss Randal!" and Laurie knocked the hat off his face with<br/>a look that left no doubt of his sentiments toward that young<br/>lady.<br/><br/>"I beg pardon, I thoughtâ€¦ " and there she paused<br/>diplomatically.<br/><br/>"No, you didn't, you knew perfectly well I never cared for<br/>anyone but Jo," Laurie said that in his old, impetuous tone, and<br/>turned his face away as he spoke.<br/><br/>"I did think so, but as they never said anything about it, and<br/>you came away, I supposed I was mistaken. And Jo wouldn't be kind<br/>to you? Why, I was sure she loved you dearly."<br/><br/>"She was kind, but not in the right way, and it's lucky for her<br/>she didn't love me, if I'm the good-for-nothing fellow you think<br/>me. It's her fault though, and you may tell her so."<br/><br/>The hard, bitter look came back again as he said that, and it<br/>troubled Amy, for she did not know what balm to apply.<br/><br/>"I was wrong, I didn't know. I'm very sorry I was so cross, but<br/>I can't help wishing you'd bear it better, Teddy, dear."<br/><br/>"Don't, that's her name for me!" and Laurie put up his hand with<br/>a quick gesture to stop the words spoken in Jo's half-kind,<br/>half-reproachful tone. "Wait till you've tried it yourself," he<br/>added in a low voice, as he pulled up the grass by the handful.<br/>
