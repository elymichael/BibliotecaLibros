<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>8<br/>Our Foreign Correspondent<br/><br/><br/><br/>London<br/><br/>Dearest People, Here I really sit at a front<br/>window of the Bath Hotel, Piccadilly. It's not a fashionable place,<br/>but Uncle stopped here years ago, and won't go anywhere else.<br/>However, we don't mean to stay long, so it's no great matter. Oh, I<br/>can't begin to tell you how I enjoy it all! I never can, so I'll<br/>only give you bits out of my notebook, for I've done nothing but<br/>sketch and scribble since I started.<br/><br/>I sent a line from Halifax, when I felt pretty<br/>miserable, but after that I got on delightfully, seldom ill, on<br/>deck all day, with plenty of pleasant people to amuse me. Everyone<br/>was very kind to me, especially the officers.

It was early in the morning, but I didn't regret getting up<br/>to see it, for the bay was full of little boats, the shore so<br/>picturesque, and a rosy sky overhead. I never shall forget it.<br/><br/>At Queenstown one of my new acquaintances left<br/>us, Mr. Lennox, and when I said something about the Lakes of<br/>Killarney, he sighed, and sung, with a look at meâ€¦<br/><br/>
