Dear me, how delighted they all were, to be sure! How Meg<br/>wouldn't believe it till she saw the words. "Miss Josephine March,"<br/>actually printed in the paper. How graciously Amy critisized the<br/>artistic parts of the story, and offered hints for a sequel, which<br/>unfortunately couldn't be carried out, as the hero and heroine were<br/>dead. How Beth got excited, and skipped and sang with joy. How<br/>Hannah came in to exclaim, "Sakes alive, well I never!" in great<br/>astonishment at 'that Jo's doin's'. How proud Mrs. March was when<br/>she knew it. How Jo laughed, with tears in her eyes, as she<br/>declared she might as well be a peacock and done with it, and how<br/>the 'Spread Eagle' might be said to flap his wings triumphantly<br/>over the House of March, as the paper passed from hand to hand.<br/><br/>"Tell us about it." "When did it come?" "How much did you get<br/>for it?" "What will Father say?" "Won't Laurie laugh?" cried the<br/>family, all in one breath as they clustered about Jo, for these<br/>foolish, affectionate people made a jubilee of every little<br/>household joy.<br/><br/>"Stop jabbering, girls, and I'll tell you everything," said Jo,<br/>wondering if Miss Burney felt any grander over her Evelina than she<br/>did over her 'Rival Painters'. Having told how she disposed of her<br/>tales, Jo added, "And when I went to get my answer, the man said he<br/>liked them both, but didn't pay beginners, only let them print in<br/>his paper, and noticed the stories. It was good practice, he said,<br/>and when the beginners improved, anyone would pay. So I let him<br/>have the two stories, and today this was sent to me, and Laurie<br/>caught me with it and insisted on seeing it, so I let him. And he<br/>said it was good, and I shall write more, and he's going to get the<br/>next paid for, and I am so happy, for in time I may be able to<br/>support myself and help the girls."<br/><br/>Jo's breath gave out here, and wrapping her head in the paper,<br/>she bedewed her little story with a few natural tears, for to be<br/>independent and earn the praise of those she loved were the dearest<br/>wishes of her heart, and this seemed to be the first step toward<br/>that happy end.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
