<br/>"Goodness only knows. Some poor creeter came a-beggin', and your<br/>ma went straight off to see what was needed. There never was such a<br/>woman for givin' away vittles and drink, clothes and firin',"<br/>replied Hannah, who had lived with the family since Meg was born,<br/>and was considered by them all more as a friend than a servant.<br/><br/>"She will be back soon, I think, so fry your cakes, and have<br/>everything ready," said Meg, looking over the presents which were<br/>collected in a basket and kept under the sofa, ready to be produced<br/>at the proper time. "Why, where is Amy's bottle of cologne?" she<br/>added, as the little flask did not appear.<br/><br/>"She took it out a minute ago, and went off with it to put a<br/>ribbon on it, or some such notion," replied Jo, dancing about the<br/>room to take the first stiffness off the new army slippers.<br/><br/>"How nice my handkerchiefs look, don't they?

It will please her very much,<br/>I know," said Meg, with a frown for Jo and a smile for Beth.<br/><br/>"There's Mother. Hide the basket, quick!" cried Jo, as a door<br/>slammed and steps sounded in the hall.<br/><br/>Amy came in hastily, and looked rather abashed when she saw her<br/>sisters all waiting for her.<br/><br/>"Where have you been, and what are you hiding behind you?" asked<br/>Meg, surprised to see, by her hood and cloak, that lazy Amy had<br/>been out so early.<br/><br/>
