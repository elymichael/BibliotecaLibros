<br/>"If I shall not be Monsieur de Trop, I will so gladly see them<br/>all. You haf been ill, my friend?"<br/><br/>He put the question abruptly, for, as Jo hung up his coat, the<br/>light fell on her face, and he saw a change in it.<br/><br/>"Not ill, but tired and sorrowful. We have had trouble since I<br/>saw you last."<br/><br/>"Ah, yes, I know. My heart was sore for you when I heard that,"<br/>and he shook hands again, with such a sympathetic face that Jo felt<br/>as if no comfort could equal the look of the kind eyes, the grasp<br/>of the big, warm hand.<br/><br/>"Father, Mother, this is my friend, Professor Bhaer," she said,<br/>with a face and tone of such irrepressible pride and pleasure that<br/>she might as well have blown a trumpet and opened the door with a<br/>flourish.<br/><br/>If the stranger had any doubts about his reception, they were<br/>set at rest in a minute by the cordial welcome he received.<br/>Everyone greeted him kindly, for Jo's sake at first, but very soon<br/>they liked him for his own. They could not help it, for he carried<br/>the talisman that opens all hearts, and these simple people warmed<br/>to him at once, feeling even the more friendly because he was poor.<br/>For poverty enriches those who live above it, and is a sure<br/>passport to truly hospitable spirits. Mr. Bhaer sat looking about<br/>him with the air of a traveler who knocks at a strange door, and<br/>when it opens, finds himself at home. The children went to him like<br/>bees to a honeypot, and establishing themselves on each knee,<br/>proceeded to captivate him by rifling his pockets, pulling his<br/>beard, and investigating his watch, with juvenile audacity. The<br/>women telegraphed their approval to one another, and Mr. March,<br/>feeling that he had got a kindred spirit, opened his choicest<br/>stores for his guest's benefit, while silent John listened and<br/>enjoyed the talk, but said not a word, and Mr. Laurence found it<br/>impossible to go to sleep.<br/><br/>If Jo had not been otherwise engaged, Laurie's behavior would<br/>have amused her, for a faint twinge, not of jealousy, but something<br/>like suspicion, caused that gentleman to stand aloof at first, and<br/>observe the newcomer with brotherly circumspection. But it did not<br/>last long. He got interested in spite of himself, and before he<br/>knew it, was drawn into the circle. For Mr. Bhaer talked well in<br/>this genial atmosphere, and did himself justice. He seldom spoke to<br/>Laurie, but he looked at him often, and a shadow would pass across<br/>his face, as if regretting his own lost youth, as he watched the<br/>young man in his prime. Then his eyes would turn to Jo so wistfully<br/>that she would have surely answered the mute inquiry if she had<br/>seen it. But Jo had her own eyes to take care of, and feeling that<br/>they could not be trusted, she prudently kept them on the little<br/>sock she was knitting, like a model maiden aunt.<br/><br/>A stealthy glance now and then refreshed her like sips of fresh<br/>water after a dusty walk, for the sidelong peeps showed her several<br/>propitious omens. Mr. Bhaer's face had lost the absent-minded<br/>expression, and looked all alive with interest in the present<br/>moment, actually young and handsome, she thought, forgetting to<br/>compare him with Laurie, as she usually did strange men, to their<br/>great detriment. Then he seemed quite inspired, though the burial<br/>customs of the ancients, to which the conversation had strayed,<br/>might not be considered an exhilarating topic. Jo quite glowed with<br/>triumph when Teddy got quenched in an argument, and thought to<br/>herself, as she watched her father's absorbed face, "How he would<br/>enjoy having such a man as my Professor to talk with every day!"<br/>Lastly, Mr. Bhaer was dressed in a new suit of black, which made<br/>him look more like a gentleman than ever. His bushy hair had been<br/>cut and smoothly brushed, but didn't stay in order long, for in<br/>exciting moments, he rumpled it up in the droll way he used to do,<br/>and Jo liked it rampantly erect better than flat, because she<br/>thought it gave his fine forehead a Jove-like aspect. Poor Jo, how<br/>she did glorify that plain man, as she sat knitting away so<br/>quietly, yet letting nothing escape her, not even the fact that Mr.<br/>Bhaer actually had gold sleeve-buttons in his immaculate<br/>wristbands.<br/><br/>"Dear old fellow! He couldn't have got himself up with more care<br/>if he'd been going a-wooing," said Jo to herself, and then a sudden<br/>thought born of the words made her blush so dreadfully that she had<br/>to drop her ball, and go down after it to hide her face.<br/><br/>The maneuver did not succeed as well as she expected, however,<br/>for though just in the act of setting fire to a funeral pyre, the<br/>Professor dropped his torch, metaphorically speaking, and made a<br/>dive after the little blue ball. Of course they bumped their heads<br/>smartly together, saw stars, and both came up flushed and laughing,<br/>without the ball, to resume their seats, wishing they had not left<br/>them.<br/><br/>
