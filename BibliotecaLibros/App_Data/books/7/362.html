John laughed, and watched her for a minute, as she poised a<br/>pretty little preparation of lace and flowers on her hand, and<br/>regarded it with the genuine interest which his harangue had failed<br/>to waken.<br/><br/>"She is trying to like politics for my sake, so I'll try and<br/>like millinery for hers, that's only fair," thought John the Just,<br/>adding aloud, "That's very pretty. Is it what you call a breakfast<br/>cap?"<br/><br/>"My dear man, it's a bonnet! My very best<br/>go-to-concert-and-theater bonnet."<br/><br/>"I beg your pardon, it was so small, I naturally mistook it for<br/>one of the flyaway things you sometimes wear. How do you keep it<br/>on?"<br/><br/>"These bits of lace are fastened under the chin with a rosebud,<br/>so," and Meg illustrated by putting on the bonnet and regarding him<br/>with an air of calm satisfaction that was irresistible.<br/><br/>"It's a love of a bonnet, but I prefer the face inside, for it<br/>looks young and happy again," and John kissed the smiling face, to<br/>the great detriment of the rosebud under the chin.<br/><br/>"I'm glad you like it, for I want you to take me to one of the<br/>new concerts some night. I really need some music to put me in<br/>tune. Will you, please?"<br/><br/>"Of course I will, with all my heart, or anywhere else you like.<br/>You have been shut up so long, it will do you no end of good, and I<br/>shall enjoy it, of all things. What put it into your head, little<br/>mother?"<br/><br/>"Well, I had a talk with Marmee the other day, and told her how<br/>nervous and cross and out of sorts I felt, and she said I needed<br/>change and less care, so Hannah is to help me with the children,<br/>and I'm to see to things about the house more, and now and then<br/>have a little fun, just to keep me from getting to be a fidgety,<br/>broken-down old woman before my time. It's only an experiment,<br/>John, and I want to try it for your sake as much as for mine,<br/>because I've neglected you shamefully lately, and I'm going to make<br/>home what it used to be, if I can. You don't object, I hope?"<br/><br/>Never mind what John said, or what a very narrow escape the<br/>little bonnet had from utter ruin. All that we have any business to<br/>know is that John did not appear to object, judging from the<br/>changes which gradually took place in the house and its inmates. It<br/>was not all Paradise by any means, but everyone was better for the<br/>division of labor system. The children throve under the paternal<br/>rule, for accurate, stedfast John brought order and obedience into<br/>Babydom, while Meg recovered her spirits and composed her nerves by<br/>plenty of wholesome exercise, a little pleasure, and much<br/>confidential conversation with her sensible husband. Home grew<br/>homelike again, and John had no wish to leave it, unless he took<br/>Meg with him. The Scotts came to the Brookes' now, and everyone<br/>found the little house a cheerful place, full of happiness,<br/>content, and family love. Even Sallie Moffatt liked to go there.<br/>"It is always so quiet and pleasant here, it does me good, Meg,"<br/>she used to say, looking about her with wistful eyes, as if trying<br/>to discover the charm, that she might use it in her great house,<br/>full of splendid loneliness, for there were no riotous, sunny-faced<br/>babies there, and Ned lived in a world of his own, where there was<br/>no place for her.<br/><br/>This household happiness did not come all at once, but John and<br/>Meg had found the key to it, and each year of married life taught<br/>them how to use it, unlocking the treasuries of real home love and<br/>mutual helpfulness, which the poorest may possess, and the richest<br/>cannot buy. This is the sort of shelf on which young wives and<br/>mothers may consent to be laid, safe from the restless fret and<br/>fever of the world, finding loyal lovers in the little sons and<br/>daughters who cling to them, undaunted by sorrow, poverty, or age,<br/>walking side by side, through fair and stormy weather, with a<br/>faithful friend, who is, in the true sense of the good old Saxon<br/>word, the 'house-band', and learning, as Meg learned, that a<br/>woman's happiest kingdom is home, her highest honor the art of<br/>ruling it not as a queen, but as a wise wife and mother.<br/>
