<br/>"Silence a la mort," replied Laurie, with a melodramatic<br/>flourish, as he went away.<br/><br/>This little bit of byplay excited Annie's curiosity, but Meg was<br/>too tired for gossip and went to bed, feeling as if she had been to<br/>a masquerade and hadn't enjoyed herself as much as she expected.<br/>She was sick all the next day, and on Saturday went home, quite<br/>used up with her fortnight's fun and feeling that she had 'sat in<br/>the lap of luxury' long enough.<br/><br/>"It does seem pleasant to be quiet, and not have company manners<br/>on all the time.
