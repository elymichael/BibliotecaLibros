Half-writ poems, stories wild,<br/>April letters, warm and cold,<br/>Diaries of a wilful child,<br/>Hints of a woman early old,<br/>A woman in a lonely home,<br/>Hearing, like a sad refrain—<br/>"Be worthy, love, and love will come,"<br/>In the falling summer rain.<br/><br/>My Beth! the dust is always swept<br/>From the lid that bears your name,<br/>As if by loving eyes that wept,<br/>By careful hands that often came.<br/>Death canonized for us one saint,<br/>Ever less human than divine,<br/>And still we lay, with tender plaint,<br/>Relics in this household shrine—<br/>The silver bell, so seldom rung,<br/>The little cap which last she wore,<br/>The fair, dead Catherine that hung<br/>By angels borne above her door.<br/>
