Seeing this did more for Jo than the wisest sermons, the
saintliest hymns, the most fervent prayers that any voice could
utter. For with eyes made clear by many tears, and a heart softened
by the tenderest sorrow, she recognized the beauty of her sister's
lifeâ€”uneventful, unambitious, yet full of the genuine virtues which
'smell sweet, and blossom in the dust', the self-forgetfulness that
makes the humblest on earth remembered soonest in heaven, the true
success which is possible to all.

One night when Beth looked among the books upon her table, to
find something to make her forget the mortal weariness that was
almost as hard to bear as pain, as she turned the leaves of her old
favorite, Pilgrims's Progress, she found a little paper, scribbled
over in Jo's hand. The name caught her eye and the blurred look of
the lines made her sure that tears had fallen on it.

"Poor Jo! She's fast asleep, so I won't wake her to ask leave.
She shows me all her things, and I don't think she'll mind if I
look at this", thought Beth, with a glance at her sister, who lay
on the rug, with the tongs beside her, ready to wake up the minute
the log fell apart.


MY BETH

Sitting patient in the shadow
Till the blessed light shall come,
A serene and saintly presence
Sanctifies our troubled home.
Earthly joys and hopes and sorrows
Break like ripples on the strand
Of the deep and solemn river
Where her willing feet now stand.

O my sister, passing from me,
Out of human care and strife,
