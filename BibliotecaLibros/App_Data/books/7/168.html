As everyone exclaimed, and Beth hugged the cropped head<br/>tenderly, Jo assumed an indifferent air, which did not deceive<br/>anyone a particle, and said, rumpling up the brown bush and trying<br/>to look as if she liked it, "It doesn't affect the fate of the<br/>nation, so don't wail, Beth. It will be good for my vanity, I was<br/>getting too proud of my wig. It will do my brains good to have that<br/>mop taken off. My head feels deliciously light and cool, and the<br/>barber said I could soon have a curly crop, which will be boyish,<br/>becoming, and easy to keep in order. I'm satisfied, so please take<br/>the money and let's have supper."<br/><br/>"Tell me all about it, Jo. I am not quite satisfied, but I can't<br/>blame you, for I know how willingly you sacrificed your vanity, as<br/>you call it, to your love. But, my dear, it was not necessary, and<br/>I'm afraid you will regret it one of these days," said Mrs.<br/>March.<br/><br/>"No, I won't!" returned Jo stoutly, feeling much relieved that<br/>her prank was not entirely condemned.<br/><br/>"What made you do it?" asked Amy, who would as soon have thought<br/>of cutting off her head as her pretty hair.<br/><br/>"Well, I was wild to do something for Father," replied Jo, as<br/>they gathered about the table, for healthy young people can eat<br/>even in the midst of trouble. "I hate to borrow as much as Mother<br/>does, and I knew Aunt March would croak, she always does, if you<br/>ask for a ninepence. Meg gave all her quarterly salary toward the<br/>rent, and I only got some clothes with mine, so I felt wicked, and<br/>was bound to have some money, if I sold the nose off my face to get<br/>it."<br/><br/>"You needn't feel wicked, my child! You had no winter things and<br/>got the simplest with your own hard earnings," said Mrs. March with<br/>a look that warmed Jo's heart.<br/><br/>"I hadn't the least idea of selling my hair at first, but as I<br/>went along I kept thinking what I could do, and feeling as if I'd<br/>like to dive into some of the rich stores and help myself. In a<br/>barber's window I saw tails of hair with the prices marked, and one<br/>black tail, not so thick as mine, was forty dollars. It came to me<br/>all of a sudden that I had one thing to make money out of, and<br/>without stopping to think, I walked in, asked if they bought hair,<br/>and what they would give for mine."<br/><br/>"I don't see how you dared to do it," said Beth in a tone of<br/>awe.<br/><br/>"Oh, he was a little man who looked as if he merely lived to oil<br/>his hair. He rather stared at first, as if he wasn't used to having<br/>girls bounce into his shop and ask him to buy their hair. He said<br/>he didn't care about mine, it wasn't the fashionable color, and he<br/>never paid much for it in the first place. The work put into it<br/>made it dear, and so on. It was getting late, and I was afraid if<br/>it wasn't done right away that I shouldn't have it done at all, and<br/>you know when I start to do a thing, I hate to give it up. So I<br/>begged him to take it, and told him why I was in such a hurry. It<br/>was silly, I dare say, but it changed his mind, for I got rather<br/>excited, and told the story in my topsy-turvy way, and his wife<br/>heard, and said so kindly, 'Take it, Thomas, and oblige the young<br/>lady. I'd do as much for our Jimmy any day if I had a spire of hair<br/>worth selling."<br/><br/>"Who was Jimmy?" asked Amy, who liked to have things explained<br/>as they went along.<br/><br/>"Her son, she said, who was in the army. How friendly such<br/>things make strangers feel, don't they? She talked away all the<br/>time the man clipped, and diverted my mind nicely."<br/>
