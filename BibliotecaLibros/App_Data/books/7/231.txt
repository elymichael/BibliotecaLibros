He seemed to think it was worth the trouble, for he smiled to
himself as if quite satisfied, pressed the plump hand gratefully,
and said in his most persuasive tone, "Will you try and find out? I
want to know so much, for I can't go to work with any heart until I
learn whether I am to have my reward in the end or not."

"I'm too young," faltered Meg, wondering why she was so
fluttered, yet rather enjoying it.

"I'll wait, and in the meantime, you could be learning to like
me. Would it be a very hard lesson, dear?"

"Not if I chose to learn it, butâ€¦ "

"Please choose to learn, Meg. I love to teach, and this is
easier than German," broke in John, getting possession of the other
hand, so that she had no way of hiding her face as he bent to look
into it.

His tone was properly beseeching, but stealing a shy look at
him, Meg saw that his eyes were merry as well as tender, and that
he wore the satisfied smile of one who had no doubt of his success.
This nettled her. Annie Moffat's foolish lessons in coquetry came
into her mind, and the love of power, which sleeps in the bosoms of
the best of little women, woke up all of a sudden and took
possession of her. She felt excited and strange, and not knowing
what else to do, followed a capricious impulse, and, withdrawing
her hands, said petulantly, "I don't choose. Please go away and let
me be!"

Poor Mr. Brooke looked as if his lovely castle in the air was
tumbling about his ears, for he had never seen Meg in such a mood
before, and it rather bewildered him.

"Do you really mean that?" he asked anxiously, following her as
she walked away.

"Yes, I do. I don't want to be worried about such things. Father
says I needn't, it's too soon and I'd rather not."

"Mayn't I hope you'll change your mind by-and-by? I'll wait and
say nothing till you have had more time. Don't play with me, Meg. I
didn't think that of you."
