<br/>To Jo's lively fancy, this fine house seemed a kind of enchanted<br/>palace, full of splendors and delights which no one enjoyed. She<br/>had long wanted to behold these hidden glories, and to know the<br/>Laurence boy, who looked as if he would like to be known, if he<br/>only knew how to begin. Since the party, she had been more eager<br/>than ever, and had planned many ways of making friends with him,<br/>but he had not been seen lately, and Jo began to think he had gone<br/>away, when she one day spied a brown face at an upper window,<br/>looking wistfully down into their garden, where Beth and Amy were<br/>snow-balling one another.<br/><br/>"That boy is suffering for society and fun," she said to<br/>herself. "His grandpa does not know what's good for him, and keeps<br/>him shut up all alone. He needs a party of jolly boys to play with,<br/>or somebody young and lively. I've a great mind to go over and tell<br/>the old gentleman so!"<br/><br/>The idea amused Jo, who liked to do daring things and was always<br/>scandalizing Meg by her queer performances. The plan of 'going<br/>over' was not forgotten. And when the snowy afternoon came, Jo<br/>resolved to try what could be done. She saw Mr. Lawrence drive off,<br/>and then sallied out to dig her way down to the hedge, where she<br/>paused and took a survey. All quiet, curtains down at the lower<br/>windows, servants out of sight, and nothing human visible but a<br/>curly black head leaning on a thin hand at the upper window.<br/><br/>"There he is," thought Jo, "Poor boy! All alone and sick this<br/>dismal day. It's a shame! I'll toss up a snowball and make him look<br/>out, and then say a kind word to him."<br/><br/>Up went a handful of soft snow, and the head turned at once,<br/>showing a face which lost its listless look in a minute, as the big<br/>eyes brightened and the mouth began to smile. Jo nodded and<br/>laughed, and flourished her broom as she called out…<br/><br/>"How do you do? Are you sick?"<br/><br/>Laurie opened the window, and croaked out as hoarsely as a<br/>raven…<br/><br/>"Better, thank you. I've had a bad cold, and been shut up a<br/>week."<br/><br/>"I'm sorry. What do you amuse yourself with?"<br/><br/>"Nothing. It's dull as tombs up here."<br/><br/>
