<br/>Presently Jo appeared, proudly bearing a flannel bundle laid<br/>forth upon a large pillow. Jo's face was very sober, but her eyes<br/>twinkled, and there was an odd sound in her voice of repressed<br/>emotion of some sort.<br/><br/>"Shut your eyes and hold out your arms," she said<br/>invitingly.<br/><br/>Laurie backed precipitately into a corner, and put his hands<br/>behind him with an imploring gesture. "No, thank you. I'd rather<br/>not. I shall drop it or smash it, as sure as fate."<br/><br/>"Then you shan't see your nevvy," said Jo decidedly, turning as<br/>if to go.<br/><br/>"I will, I will!

I wouldn't have<br/>told you, for I set my heart on surprising you, and I flatter<br/>myself I've done it," said Jo, when she got her breath.<br/><br/>"I never was more staggered in my life. Isn't it fun? Are they<br/>boys? What are you going to name them? Let's have another look.<br/>Hold me up, Jo, for upon my life it's one too many for me,"<br/>returned Laurie, regarding the infants with the air of a big,<br/>benevolent Newfoundland looking at a pair of infantile kittens.<br/><br/>
