To which pathetic appeal Daisy would answer with a coo, or Demi
with a crow, and Meg would put by her lamentations for a maternal
revel, which soothed her solitude for the time being. But the pain
increased as politics absorbed John, who was always running over to
discuss interesting points with Scott, quite unconscious that Meg
missed him. Not a word did she say, however, till her mother found
her in tears one day, and insisted on knowing what the matter was,
for Meg's drooping spirits had not escaped her observation.

"I wouldn't tell anyone except you, Mother, but I really do need
advice, for if John goes on much longer I might as well be
widowed," replied Mrs. Brooke, drying her tears on Daisy's bib with
an injured air.

"Goes on how, my dear?" asked her mother anxiously.

"He's away all day, and at night when I want to see him, he is
continually going over to the Scotts'. It isn't fair that I should
have the hardest work, and never any amusement. Men are very
selfish, even the best of them."

"So are women. Don't blame John till you see where you are wrong
yourself."

"But it can't be right for him to neglect me."

"Don't you neglect him?"

"Why, Mother, I thought you'd take my part!"

"So I do, as far as sympathizing goes, but I think the fault is
yours, Meg."

"I don't see how."
