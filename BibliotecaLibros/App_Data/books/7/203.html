<br/>As Amy pointed to the smiling Christ child on his Mother's knee,<br/>Mrs. March saw something on the lifted hand that made her smile.<br/>She said nothing, but Amy understood the look, and after a minute's<br/>pause, she added gravely, "I wanted to speak to you about this, but<br/>I forgot it. Aunt gave me the ring today. She called me to her and<br/>kissed me, and put it on my finger, and said I was a credit to her,<br/>and she'd like to keep me always. She gave that funny guard to keep<br/>the turquoise on, as it's too big. I'd like to wear them Mother,<br/>can I?"<br/><br/>"They are very pretty, but I think you're rather too young for<br/>such ornaments, Amy," said Mrs. March, looking at the plump little<br/>hand, with the band of sky-blue stones on the forefinger, and the<br/>quaint guard formed of two tiny golden hands clasped together.<br/><br/>"I'll try not to be vain," said Amy. "I don't think I like it<br/>only because it's so pretty, but I want to wear it as the girl in<br/>the story wore her bracelet, to remind me of something."<br/><br/>"Do you mean Aunt March?" asked her mother, laughing.<br/><br/>"No, to remind me not to be selfish." Amy looked so earnest and<br/>sincere about it that her mother stopped laughing, and listened<br/>respectfully to the little plan.<br/><br/>"I've thought a great deal lately about my 'bundle of<br/>naughties', and being selfish is the largest one in it, so I'm<br/>going to try hard to cure it, if I can. Beth isn't selfish, and<br/>that's the reason everyone loves her and feels so bad at the<br/>thoughts of losing her. People wouldn't feel so bad about me if I<br/>was sick, and I don't deserve to have them, but I'd like to be<br/>loved and missed by a great many friends, so I'm going to try and<br/>be like Beth all I can. I'm apt to forget my resolutions, but if I<br/>had something always about me to remind me, I guess I should do<br/>better. May we try this way?"<br/><br/>"Yes, but I have more faith in the corner of the big closet.<br/>Wear your ring, dear, and do your best. I think you will prosper,<br/>for the sincere wish to be good is half the battle. Now I must go<br/>back to Beth. Keep up your heart, little daughter, and we will soon<br/>have you home again."<br/><br/>That evening while Meg was writing to her father to report the<br/>traveler's safe arrival, Jo slipped upstairs into Beth's room, and<br/>finding her mother in her usual place, stood a minute twisting her<br/>fingers in her hair, with a worried gesture and an undecided<br/>look.<br/><br/>"What is it, deary?" asked Mrs. March, holding out her hand,<br/>with a face which invited confidence.<br/><br/>"I want to tell you something, Mother."<br/><br/>
