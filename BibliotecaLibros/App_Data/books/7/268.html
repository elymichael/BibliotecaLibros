"The… The jelly won't jell and I don't know what to do!"<br/><br/>John Brooke laughed then as he never dared to laugh afterward,<br/>and the derisive Scott smiled involuntarily as he heard the hearty<br/>peal, which put the finishing stroke to poor Meg's woe.<br/><br/>"Is that all? Fling it out of the window, and don't bother any<br/>more about it. I'll buy you quarts if you want it, but for heaven's<br/>sake don't have hysterics, for I've brought Jack Scott home to<br/>dinner, and… "<br/><br/>John got no further, for Meg cast him off, and clasped her hands<br/>with a tragic gesture as she fell into a chair, exclaiming in a<br/>tone of mingled indignation, reproach, and dismay…<br/><br/>"A man to dinner, and everything in a mess! John Brooke, how<br/>could you do such a thing?"<br/><br/>"Hush, he's in the garden! I forgot the confounded jelly, but it<br/>can't be helped now," said John, surveying the prospect with an<br/>anxious eye.<br/><br/>"You ought to have sent word, or told me this morning, and you<br/>ought to have remembered how busy I was," continued Meg petulantly,<br/>for even turtledoves will peck when ruffled.<br/><br/>"I didn't know it this morning, and there was no time to send<br/>word, for I met him on the way out. I never thought of asking<br/>leave, when you have always told me to do as I liked. I never tried<br/>it before, and hang me if I ever do again!" added John, with an<br/>aggrieved air.<br/><br/>"I should hope not! Take him away at once. I can't see him, and<br/>there isn't any dinner."<br/><br/>"Well, I like that! Where's the beef and vegetables I sent home,<br/>and the pudding you promised?" cried John, rushing to the<br/>larder.<br/><br/>"I hadn't time to cook anything. I meant to dine at Mother's.<br/>I'm sorry, but I was so busy," and Meg's tears began again.<br/>
