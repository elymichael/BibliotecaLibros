"So am I, but a kind word will govern me when all the king's
horses and all the king's men couldn't," said Jo, trying to say a
kind word for her friend, who seemed to get out of one scrape only
to fall into another.

"You think I'm not kind to him, hey?" was the sharp answer.

"Oh, dear no, Sir. You are rather too kind sometimes, and then
just a trifle hasty when he tries your patience. Don't you think
you are?"

Jo was determined to have it out now, and tried to look quite
placid, though she quaked a little after her bold speech. To her
great relief and surprise, the old gentleman only threw his
spectacles onto the table with a rattle and exclaimed frankly,
"You're right, girl, I am! I love the boy, but he tries my patience
past bearing, and I know how it will end, if we go on so."

"I'll tell you, he'll run away." Jo was sorry for that speech
the minute it was made. She meant to warn him that Laurie would not
bear much restraint, and hoped he would be more forebearing with
the lad.

Mr. Laurence's ruddy face changed suddenly, and he sat down,
with a troubled glance at the picture of a handsome man, which hung
over his table. It was Laurie's father, who had run away in his
youth, and married against the imperious old man's will. Jo fancied
he remembered and regretted the past, and she wished she had held
her tongue.

"He won't do it unless he is very much worried, and only
threatens it sometimes, when he gets tired of studying. I often
think I should like to, especially since my hair was cut, so if you
ever miss us, you may advertise for two boys and look among the
ships bound for India."

She laughed as she spoke, and Mr. Laurence looked relieved,
evidently taking the whole as a joke.

"You hussy, how dare you talk in that way? Where's your respect
for me, and your proper bringing up? Bless the boys and girls! What
torments they are, yet we can't do without them," he said, pinching
her cheeks good-humoredly. "Go and bring that boy down to his
dinner, tell him it's all right, and advise him not to put on
tragedy airs with his grandfather. I won't bear it."

"He won't come, Sir. He feels badly because you didn't believe
him when he said he couldn't tell. I think the shaking hurt his
feelings very much."

Jo tried to look pathetic but must have failed, for Mr. Laurence
began to laugh, and she knew the day was won.
