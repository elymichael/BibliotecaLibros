"Sometimes. You see I've been abroad a good many years, and
haven't been into company enough yet to know how you do things
here."

"Abroad!" cried Jo. "Oh, tell me about it! I love dearly to hear
people describe their travels."

Laurie didn't seem to know where to begin, but Jo's eager
questions soon set him going, and he told her how he had been at
school in Vevay, where the boys never wore hats and had a fleet of
boats on the lake, and for holiday fun went on walking trips about
Switzerland with their teachers.

"Don't I wish I'd been there!" cried Jo. "Did you go to
Paris?"

"We spent last winter there."

"Can you talk French?"

"We were not allowed to speak anything else at Vevay."

"Do say some! I can read it, but can't pronounce."

"Quel nom a cette jeune demoiselle en les pantoufles jolis?"

"How nicely you do it! Let me see&#160;â€¦ you said, 'Who is the
young lady in the pretty slippers', didn't you?"

"Oui, mademoiselle."
