"We have our plans. We don't mean to say much about them yet,
because we are such very new brooms, but we don't intend to be
idle. I'm going into business with a devotion that shall delight
Grandfather, and prove to him that I'm not spoiled. I need
something of the sort to keep me steady. I'm tired of dawdling, and
mean to work like a man."

"And Amy, what is she going to do?" asked Mrs. March, well
pleased at Laurie's decision and the energy with which he
spoke.

"After doing the civil all round, and airing our best bonnet, we
shall astonish you by the elegant hospitalities of our mansion, the
brilliant society we shall draw about us, and the beneficial
influence we shall exert over the world at large. That's about it,
isn't it, Madame Recamier?" asked Laurie with a quizzical look at
Amy.

"Time will show. Come away, Impertinence, and don't shock my
family by calling me names before their faces," answered Amy,
resolving that there should be a home with a good wife in it before
she set up a salon as a queen of society.

"How happy those children seem together!" observed Mr. March,
finding it difficult to become absorbed in his Aristotle after the
young couple had gone.

"Yes, and I think it will last," added Mrs. March, with the
restful expression of a pilot who has brought a ship safely into
port.

"I know it will. Happy Amy!" and Jo sighed, then smiled brightly
as Professor Bhaer opened the gate with an impatient push.

Later in the evening, when his mind had been set at rest about
the bootjack, Laurie said suddenly to his wife, "Mrs.
Laurence."

"My Lord!"

"That man intends to marry our Jo!"
