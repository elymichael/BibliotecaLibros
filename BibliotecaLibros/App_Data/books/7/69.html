<br/>"So it is!" cried Laurie, who was playing chess in a corner with<br/>Jo. "I knew a girl once, who had a really remarkable talent for<br/>music, and she didn't know it, never guessed what sweet little<br/>things she composed when she was alone, and wouldn't have believed<br/>it if anyone had told her."<br/><br/>"I wish I'd known that nice girl. Maybe she would have helped<br/>me, I'm so stupid," said Beth, who stood beside him, listening<br/>eagerly.<br/><br/>"You do know her, and she helps you better than anyone else<br/>could," answered Laurie, looking at her with such mischievous<br/>meaning in his merry black eyes that Beth suddenly turned very red,<br/>and hid her face in the sofa cushion, quite overcome by such an<br/>unexpected discovery.<br/><br/>Jo let Laurie win the game to pay for that praise of her Beth,<br/>who could not be prevailed upon to play for them after her<br/>compliment. So Laurie did his best, and sang delightfully, being in<br/>a particularly lively humor, for to the Marches he seldom showed<br/>the moody side of his character. When he was gone, Amy, who had<br/>been pensive all evening, said suddenly, as if busy over some new<br/>idea, "Is Laurie an accomplished boy?"<br/><br/>"Yes, he has had an excellent education, and has much talent. He<br/>will make a fine man, if not spoiled by petting," replied her<br/>mother.<br/><br/>"And he isn't conceited, is he?" asked Amy.<br/><br/>"Not in the least. That is why he is so charming and we all like<br/>him so much."<br/><br/>"I see. It's nice to have accomplishments and be elegant, but<br/>not to show off or get perked up," said Amy thoughtfully.<br/><br/>"These things are always seen and felt in a person's manner and<br/>conversations, if modestly used, but it is not necessary to display<br/>them," said Mrs. March.<br/><br/>"Any more than it's proper to wear all your bonnets and gowns<br/>and ribbons at once, that folks may know you've got them," added<br/>Jo, and the lecture ended in a laugh.<br/><br/>
