<br/>He seemed to think it was worth the trouble, for he smiled to<br/>himself as if quite satisfied, pressed the plump hand gratefully,<br/>and said in his most persuasive tone, "Will you try and find out? I<br/>want to know so much, for I can't go to work with any heart until I<br/>learn whether I am to have my reward in the end or not."<br/><br/>"I'm too young," faltered Meg, wondering why she was so<br/>fluttered, yet rather enjoying it.<br/><br/>"I'll wait, and in the meantime, you could be learning to like<br/>me. Would it be a very hard lesson, dear?"<br/><br/>"Not if I chose to learn it, butâ€¦ "<br/><br/>"Please choose to learn, Meg. I love to teach, and this is<br/>easier than German," broke in John, getting possession of the other<br/>hand, so that she had no way of hiding her face as he bent to look<br/>into it.<br/><br/>His tone was properly beseeching, but stealing a shy look at<br/>him, Meg saw that his eyes were merry as well as tender, and that<br/>he wore the satisfied smile of one who had no doubt of his success.<br/>This nettled her. Annie Moffat's foolish lessons in coquetry came<br/>into her mind, and the love of power, which sleeps in the bosoms of<br/>the best of little women, woke up all of a sudden and took<br/>possession of her. She felt excited and strange, and not knowing<br/>what else to do, followed a capricious impulse, and, withdrawing<br/>her hands, said petulantly, "I don't choose. Please go away and let<br/>me be!"<br/><br/>Poor Mr. Brooke looked as if his lovely castle in the air was<br/>tumbling about his ears, for he had never seen Meg in such a mood<br/>before, and it rather bewildered him.<br/><br/>"Do you really mean that?" he asked anxiously, following her as<br/>she walked away.<br/><br/>"Yes, I do. I don't want to be worried about such things. Father<br/>says I needn't, it's too soon and I'd rather not."<br/><br/>"Mayn't I hope you'll change your mind by-and-by? I'll wait and<br/>say nothing till you have had more time. Don't play with me, Meg. I<br/>didn't think that of you."<br/><br/>
