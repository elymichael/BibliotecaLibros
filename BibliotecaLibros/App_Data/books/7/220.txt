Everyone thought the matter ended and the little cloud blown
over, but the mischief was done, for though others forgot it, Meg
remembered. She never alluded to a certain person, but she thought
of him a good deal, dreamed dreams more than ever, and once Jo,
rummaging her sister's desk for stamps, found a bit of paper
scribbled over with the words, 'Mrs. John Brooke', whereat she
groaned tragically and cast it into the fire, feeling that Laurie's
prank had hastened the evil day for her.
