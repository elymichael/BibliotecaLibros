Aunt March Settles the Question


Like bees swarming after their queen, mother and daughters
hovered about Mr. March the next day, neglecting everything to look
at, wait upon, and listen to the new invalid, who was in a fair way
to be killed by kindness. As he sat propped up in a big chair by
Beth's sofa, with the other three close by, and Hannah popping in
her head now and then 'to peek at the dear man', nothing seemed
needed to complete their happiness. But something was needed, and
the elder ones felt it, though none confessed the fact. Mr. and
Mrs. March looked at one another with an anxious expression, as
their eyes followed Meg. Jo had sudden fits of sobriety, and was
seen to shake her fist at Mr. Brooke's umbrella, which had been
left in the hall. Meg was absent-minded, shy, and silent, started
when the bell rang, and colored when John's name was mentioned. Amy
said, "Everyone seemed waiting for something, and couldn't settle
down, which was queer, since Father was safe at home," and Beth
innocently wondered why their neighbors didn't run over as
usual.

Laurie went by in the afternoon, and seeing Meg at the window,
seemed suddenly possessed with a melodramatic fit, for he fell down
on one knee in the snow, beat his breast, tore his hair, and
clasped his hands imploringly, as if begging some boon. And when
Meg told him to behave himself and go away, he wrung imaginary
tears out of his handkerchief, and staggered round the corner as if
in utter despair.

"What does the goose mean?" said Meg, laughing and trying to
look unconscious.

"He's showing you how your John will go on by-and-by. Touching,
isn't it?" answered Jo scornfully.

"Don't say my John, it isn't proper or true," but Meg's voice
lingered over the words as if they sounded pleasant to her. "Please
don't plague me, Jo, I've told you I don't care much about him, and
there isn't to be anything said, but we are all to be friendly, and
go on as before."

"We can't, for something has been said, and Laurie's mischief
has spoiled you for me. I see it, and so does Mother. You are not
like your old self a bit, and seem ever so far away from me. I
don't mean to plague you and will bear it like a man, but I do wish
it was all settled. I hate to wait, so if you mean ever to do it,
make haste and have it over quickly," said Jo pettishly.

"I can't say anything till he speaks, and he won't, because
Father said I was too young," began Meg, bending over her work with
a queer little smile, which suggested that she did not quite agree
with her father on that point.
