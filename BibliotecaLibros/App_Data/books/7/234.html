"Not yet. Mr. Laurence is going to help him."<br/><br/>"That won't last long. James Laurence is a crotchety old fellow<br/>and not to be depended on. So you intend to marry a man without<br/>money, position, or business, and go on working harder than you do<br/>now, when you might be comfortable all your days by minding me and<br/>doing better? I thought you had more sense, Meg."<br/><br/>"I couldn't do better if I waited half my life! John is good and<br/>wise, he's got heaps of talent, he's willing to work and sure to<br/>get on, he's so energetic and brave. Everyone likes and respects<br/>him, and I'm proud to think he cares for me, though I'm so poor and<br/>young and silly," said Meg, looking prettier than ever in her<br/>earnestness.<br/><br/>"He knows you have got rich relations, child. That's the secret<br/>of his liking, I suspect."<br/><br/>"Aunt March, how dare you say such a thing? John is above such<br/>meanness, and I won't listen to you a minute if you talk so," cried<br/>Meg indignantly, forgetting everything but the injustice of the old<br/>lady's suspicions. "My John wouldn't marry for money, any more than<br/>I would. We are willing to work and we mean to wait. I'm not afraid<br/>of being poor, for I've been happy so far, and I know I shall be<br/>with him because he loves me, and Iâ€¦ "<br/><br/>Meg stopped there, remembering all of a sudden that she hadn't<br/>made up her mind, that she had told 'her John' to go away, and that<br/>he might be overhearing her inconsistent remarks.<br/><br/>Aunt March was very angry, for she had set her heart on having<br/>her pretty niece make a fine match, and something in the girl's<br/>happy young face made the lonely old woman feel both sad and<br/>sour.<br/><br/>"Well, I wash my hands of the whole affair! You are a willful<br/>child, and you've lost more than you know by this piece of folly.<br/>No, I won't stop. I'm disappointed in you, and haven't spirits to<br/>see your father now. Don't expect anything from me when you are<br/>married. Your Mr. Brooke's friends must take care of you. I'm done<br/>with you forever."<br/><br/>And slamming the door in Meg's face, Aunt March drove off in<br/>high dudgeon. She seemed to take all the girl's courage with her,<br/>for when left alone, Meg stood for a moment, undecided whether to<br/>laugh or cry. Before she could make up her mind, she was taken<br/>possession of by Mr. Brooke, who said all in one breath, "I<br/>couldn't help hearing, Meg. Thank you for defending me, and Aunt<br/>March for proving that you do care for me a little bit."<br/><br/>"I didn't know how much till she abused you," began Meg.<br/><br/>"And I needn't go away, but may stay and be happy, may I,<br/>dear?"<br/>
