I'm so fond of writing, I should go spinning on
forever if motives of economy didn't stop me, for though I've used
thin paper and written fine, I tremble to think of the stamps this
long letter will need. Pray forward Amy's as soon as you can spare
them. My small news will sound very flat after her splendors, but
you will like them, I know. Is Teddy studying so hard that he can't
find time to write to his friends? Take good care of him for me,
Beth, and tell me all about the babies, and give heaps of love to
everyone. From your faithful Jo.

P.S. On reading over my letter, it strikes me as
rather Bhaery, but I am always interested in odd people, and I
really had nothing else to write about. Bless you!

My Precious Betsey,

As this is to be a scribble-scrabble letter, I
direct it to you, for it may amuse you, and give you some idea of
my goings on, for though quiet, they are rather amusing, for which,
oh, be joyful! After what Amy would call Herculaneum efforts, in
the way of mental and moral agriculture, my young ideas begin to
shoot and my little twigs to bend as I could wish. They are not so
interesting to me as Tina and the boys, but I do my duty by them,
and they are fond of me. Franz and Emil are jolly little lads,
quite after my own heart, for the mixture of German and American
spirit in them produces a constant state of effervescence. Saturday
afternoons are riotous times, whether spent in the house or out,
for on pleasant days they all go to walk, like a seminary, with the
Professor and myself to keep order, and then such fun!

We are very good friends now, and I've begun to
take lessons. I really couldn't help it, and it all came about in
such a droll way that I must tell you. To begin at the beginning,
Mrs. Kirke called to me one day as I passed Mr. Bhaer's room where
she was rummaging.

"Did you ever see such a den, my dear? Just come
and help me put these books to rights, for I've turned everything
upside down, trying to discover what he has done with the six new
handkerchiefs I gave him not long ago."

I went in, and while we worked I looked about me,
for it was 'a den' to be sure. Books and papers everywhere, a
broken meerschaum, and an old flute over the mantlepiece as if done
with, a ragged bird without any tail chirped on one window seat,
and a box of white mice adorned the other. Half-finished boats and
bits of string lay among the manuscripts. Dirty little boots stood
drying before the fire, and traces of the dearly beloved boys, for
whom he makes a slave of himself, were to be seen all over the
room. After a grand rummage three of the missing articles were
found, one over the bird cage, one covered with ink, and a third
burned brown, having been used as a holder.

"Such a man!" laughed good-natured Mrs. K., as
she put the relics in the rag bay. "I suppose the others are torn
up to rig ships, bandage cut fingers, or make kite tails. It's
dreadful, but I can't scold him. He's so absent-minded and
goodnatured, he lets those boys ride over him roughshod. I agreed
to do his washing and mending, but he forgets to give out his
things and I forget to look them over, so he comes to a sad pass
sometimes."

"Let me mend them," said I. "I don't mind it, and
he needn't know. I'd like to, he's so kind to me about bringing my
letters and lending books."

So I have got his things in order, and knit heels
into two pairs of the socks, for they were boggled out of shape
with his queer darns. Nothing was said, and I hoped he wouldn't
find it out, but one day last week he caught me at it. Hearing the
lessons he gives to others has interested and amused me so much
that I took a fancy to learn, for Tina runs in and out, leaving the
door open, and I can hear. I had been sitting near this door,
finishing off the last sock, and trying to understand what he said
to a new scholar, who is as stupid as I am. The girl had gone, and
I thought he had also, it was so still, and I was busily gabbling
over a verb, and rocking to and fro in a most absurd way, when a
little crow made me look up, and there was Mr. Bhaer looking and
laughing quietly, while he made signs to Tina not to betray
him.
