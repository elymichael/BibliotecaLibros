<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>16<br/>Lazy Laurence<br/><br/><br/>Laurie went to Nice intending to stay a week, and remained a<br/>month. He was tired of wandering about alone, and Amy's familiar<br/>presence seemed to give a homelike charm to the foreign scenes in<br/>which she bore a part. He rather missed the 'petting' he used to<br/>receive, and enjoyed a taste of it again, for no attentions,<br/>however flattering, from strangers, were half so pleasant as the<br/>sisterly adoration of the girls at home. Amy never would pet him<br/>like the others, but she was very glad to see him now, and quite<br/>clung to him, feeling that he was the representative of the dear<br/>family for whom she longed more than she would confess. They<br/>naturally took comfort in each other's society and were much<br/>together, riding, walking, dancing, or dawdling, for at Nice no one<br/>can be very industrious during the gay season. But, while<br/>apparently amusing themselves in the most careless fashion, they<br/>were half-consciously making discoveries and forming opinions about<br/>each other. Amy rose daily in the estimation of her friend, but he<br/>sank in hers, and each felt the truth before a word was spoken. Amy<br/>tried to please, and succeeded, for she was grateful for the many<br/>pleasures he gave her, and repaid him with the little services to<br/>which womanly women know how to lend an indescribable charm. Laurie<br/>made no effort of any kind, but just let himself drift along as<br/>comfortably as possible, trying to forget, and feeling that all<br/>women owed him a kind word because one had been cold to him. It<br/>cost him no effort to be generous, and he would have given Amy all<br/>the trinkets in Nice if she would have taken them, but at the same<br/>time he felt that he could not change the opinion she was forming<br/>of him, and he rather dreaded the keen blue eyes that seemed to<br/>watch him with such half-sorrowful, half-scornful surprise.<br/><br/>"All the rest have gone to Monaco for the day. I preferred to<br/>stay at home and write letters. They are done now, and I am going<br/>to Valrosa to sketch, will you come?" said Amy, as she joined<br/>Laurie one lovely day when he lounged in as usual, about noon.<br/><br/>"Well, yes, but isn't it rather warm for such a long walk?" he<br/>answered slowly, for the shaded salon looked inviting after the<br/>glare without.<br/><br/>"I'm going to have the little carriage, and Baptiste can drive,<br/>so you'll have nothing to do but hold your umbrella, and keep your<br/>gloves nice," returned Amy, with a sarcastic glance at the<br/>immaculate kids, which were a weak point with Laurie.<br/><br/>"Then I'll go with pleasure." and he put out his hand for her<br/>sketchbook. But she tucked it under her arm with a sharpâ€¦<br/><br/>"Don't trouble yourself. It's no exertion to me, but you don't<br/>look equal to it."<br/><br/>Laurie lifted his eyebrows and followed at a leisurely pace as<br/>she ran downstairs, but when they got into the carriage he took the<br/>reins himself, and left little Baptiste nothing to do but fold his<br/>arms and fall asleep on his perch.<br/>
