<br/>"If he did speak, you wouldn't know what to say, but would cry<br/>or blush, or let him have his own way, instead of giving a good,<br/>decided no."<br/><br/>"I'm not so silly and weak as you think. I know just what I<br/>should say, for I've planned it all, so I needn't be taken<br/>unawares. There's no knowing what may happen, and I wished to be<br/>prepared."<br/><br/>Jo couldn't help smiling at the important air which Meg had<br/>unconsciously assumed and which was as becoming as the pretty color<br/>varying in her cheeks.<br/><br/>"Would you mind telling me what you'd say?" asked Jo more<br/>respectfully.<br/><br/>"Not at all. You are sixteen now, quite old enough to be my<br/>confident, and my experience will be useful to you by-and-by,<br/>perhaps, in your own affairs of this sort."<br/><br/>"Don't mean to have any. It's fun to watch other people<br/>philander, but I should feel like a fool doing it myself," said Jo,<br/>looking alarmed at the thought.<br/><br/>"I think not, if you liked anyone very much, and he liked you."<br/>Meg spoke as if to herself, and glanced out at the lane where she<br/>had often seen lovers walking together in the summer twilight.<br/><br/>"I thought you were going to tell your speech to that man," said<br/>Jo, rudely shortening her sister's little reverie.<br/><br/>"Oh, I should merely say, quite calmly and decidedly, 'Thank<br/>you, Mr. Brooke, you are very kind, but I agree with Father that I<br/>am too young to enter into any engagement at present, so please say<br/>no more, but let us be friends as we were.'"<br/><br/>"Hum, that's stiff and cool enough! I don't believe you'll ever<br/>say it, and I know he won't be satisfied if you do. If he goes on<br/>like the rejected lovers in books, you'll give in, rather than hurt<br/>his feelings."<br/><br/>
