"I thought so. It was like you, but it was no use. I only loved<br/>you all the more, and I worked hard to please you, and I gave up<br/>billiards and everything you didn't like, and waited and never<br/>complained, for I hoped you'd love me, though I'm not half good<br/>enoughâ€¦ " Here there was a choke that couldn't be controlled, so he<br/>decapitated buttercups while he cleared his 'confounded<br/>throat'.<br/><br/>"You, you are, you're a great deal too good for me, and I'm so<br/>grateful to you, and so proud and fond of you, I don't know why I<br/>can't love you as you want me to. I've tried, but I can't change<br/>the feeling, and it would be a lie to say I do when I don't."<br/><br/>"Really, truly, Jo?"<br/><br/>He stopped short, and caught both her hands as he put his<br/>question with a look that she did not soon forget.<br/><br/>"Really, truly, dear."<br/><br/>They were in the grove now, close by the stile, and when the<br/>last words fell reluctantly from Jo's lips, Laurie dropped her<br/>hands and turned as if to go on, but for once in his life the fence<br/>was too much for him. So he just laid his head down on the mossy<br/>post, and stood so still that Jo was frightened.<br/><br/>"Oh, Teddy, I'm sorry, so desperately sorry, I could kill myself<br/>if it would do any good! I wish you wouldn't take it so hard, I<br/>can't help it. You know it's impossible for people to make<br/>themselves love other people if they don't," cried Jo inelegantly<br/>but remorsefully, as she softly patted his shoulder, remembering<br/>the time when he had comforted her so long ago.<br/><br/>"They do sometimes," said a muffled voice from the post. "I<br/>don't believe it's the right sort of love, and I'd rather not try<br/>it," was the decided answer.<br/><br/>There was a long pause, while a blackbird sung blithely on the<br/>willow by the river, and the tall grass rustled in the wind.<br/>Presently Jo said very soberly, as she sat down on the step of the<br/>stile, "Laurie, I want to tell you something."<br/><br/>He started as if he had been shot, threw up his head, and cried<br/>out in a fierce tone, "Don't tell me that, Jo, I can't bear it<br/>now!"<br/><br/>"Tell what?" she asked, wondering at his violence.<br/>
