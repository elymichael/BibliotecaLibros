<br/>"I'll call. Good morning, Sir."<br/><br/>As she departed, Mr. Dashwood put up his feet, with the graceful<br/>remark, "Poor and proud, as usual, but she'll do."<br/><br/>Following Mr. Dashwood's directions, and making Mrs. Northbury<br/>her model, Jo rashly took a plunge into the frothy sea of<br/>sensational literature, but thanks to the life preserver thrown her<br/>by a friend, she came up again not much the worse for her<br/>ducking.<br/><br/>Like most young scribblers, she went abroad for her characters<br/>and scenery, and banditti, counts, gypsies, nuns, and duchesses<br/>appeared upon her stage, and played their parts with as much<br/>accuracy and spirit as could be expected. Her readers were not<br/>particular about such trifles as grammar, punctuation, and<br/>probability, and Mr. Dashwood graciously permitted her to fill his<br/>columns at the lowest prices, not thinking it necessary to tell her<br/>that the real cause of his hospitality was the fact that one of his<br/>hacks, on being offered higher wages, had basely left him in the<br/>lurch.<br/><br/>She soon became interested in her work, for her emaciated purse<br/>grew stout, and the little hoard she was making to take Beth to the<br/>mountains next summer grew slowly but surely as the weeks passed.<br/>One thing disturbed her satisfaction, and that was that she did not<br/>tell them at home. She had a feeling that Father and Mother would<br/>not approve, and preferred to have her own way first, and beg<br/>pardon afterward. It was easy to keep her secret, for no name<br/>appeared with her stories. Mr. Dashwood had of course found it out<br/>very soon, but promised to be dumb, and for a wonder kept his<br/>word.<br/><br/>She thought it would do her no harm, for she sincerely meant to<br/>write nothing of which she would be ashamed, and quieted all pricks<br/>of conscience by anticipations of the happy minute when she should<br/>show her earnings and laugh over her well-kept secret.<br/><br/>But Mr. Dashwood rejected any but thrilling tales, and as<br/>thrills could not be produced except by harrowing up the souls of<br/>the readers, history and romance, land and sea, science and art,<br/>police records and lunatic asylums, had to be ransacked for the<br/>purpose. Jo soon found that her innocent experience had given her<br/>but few glimpses of the tragic world which underlies society, so<br/>regarding it in a business light, she set about supplying her<br/>deficiencies with characteristic energy. Eager to find material for<br/>stories, and bent on making them original in plot, if not masterly<br/>in execution, she searched newspapers for accidents, incidents, and<br/>crimes. She excited the suspicions of public librarians by asking<br/>for works on poisons. She studied faces in the street, and<br/>characters, good, bad, and indifferent, all about her. She delved<br/>in the dust of ancient times for facts or fictions so old that they<br/>were as good as new, and introduced herself to folly, sin, and<br/>misery, as well as her limited opportunities allowed. She thought<br/>she was prospering finely, but unconsciously she was beginning to<br/>desecrate some of the womanliest attributes of a woman's character.<br/>She was living in bad society, and imaginary though it was, its<br/>influence affected her, for she was feeding heart and fancy on<br/>dangerous and unsubstantial food, and was fast brushing the<br/>innocent bloom from her nature by a premature acquaintance with the<br/>darker side of life, which comes soon enough to all of us.<br/><br/>She was beginning to feel rather than see this, for much<br/>describing of other people's passions and feelings set her to<br/>studying and speculating about her own, a morbid amusement in which<br/>healthy young minds do not voluntarily indulge. Wrongdoing always<br/>brings its own punishment, and when Jo most needed hers, she got<br/>it.<br/><br/>I don't know whether the study of Shakespeare helped her to read<br/>character, or the natural instinct of a woman for what was honest,<br/>brave, and strong, but while endowing her imaginary heroes with<br/>every perfection under the sun, Jo was discovering a live hero, who<br/>interested her in spite of many human imperfections. Mr. Bhaer, in<br/>one of their conversations, had advised her to study simple, true,<br/>and lovely characters, wherever she found them, as good training<br/>for a writer. Jo took him at his word, for she coolly turned round<br/>and studied himâ€”a proceeding which would have much surprised him,<br/>had he known it, for the worthy Professor was very humble in his<br/>own conceit.<br/><br/>Why everybody liked him was what puzzled Jo, at first. He was<br/>neither rich nor great, young nor handsome, in no respect what is<br/>called fascinating, imposing, or brilliant, and yet he was as<br/>attractive as a genial fire, and people seemed to gather about him<br/>as naturally as about a warm hearth. He was poor, yet always<br/>appeared to be giving something away; a stranger, yet everyone was<br/>his friend; no longer young, but as happy-hearted as a boy; plain<br/>and peculiar, yet his face looked beautiful to many, and his<br/>oddities were freely forgiven for his sake. Jo often watched him,<br/>trying to discover the charm, and at last decided that it was<br/>benevolence which worked the miracle. If he had any sorrow, 'it sat<br/>with its head under its wing', and he turned only his sunny side to<br/>the world. There were lines upon his forehead, but Time seemed to<br/>have touched him gently, remembering how kind he was to others. The<br/>pleasant curves about his mouth were the memorials of many friendly<br/>words and cheery laughs, his eyes were never cold or hard, and his<br/>big hand had a warm, strong grasp that was more expressive than<br/>words.<br/><br/>
