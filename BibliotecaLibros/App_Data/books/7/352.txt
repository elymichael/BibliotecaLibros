"My rouge won't come off." and Amy rubbed her brilliant cheek,
and showed him her white glove with a sober simplicity that made
him laugh outright.

"What do you call this stuff?" he asked, touching a fold of her
dress that had blown over his knee.

"Illusion."

"Good name for it. It's very pretty—new thing, isn't it?"

"It's as old as the hills. You have seen it on dozens of girls,
and you never found out that it was pretty till now—stupide!"

"I never saw it on you before, which accounts for the mistake,
you see."

"None of that, it is forbidden. I'd rather take coffee than
compliments just now. No, don't lounge, it makes me nervous."

Laurie sat bold upright, and meekly took her empty plate feeling
an odd sort of pleasure in having 'little Amy' order him about, for
she had lost her shyness now, and felt an irrestible desire to
trample on him, as girls have a delightful way of doing when lords
of creation show any signs of subjection.

"Where did you learn all this sort of thing?" he asked with a
quizzical look.

"As 'this sort of thing' is rather a vague expression, would you
kindly explain?" returned Amy, knowing perfectly well what he
meant, but wickedly leaving him to describe what is
indescribable.

"Well—the general air, the style, the self-possession,
the—the—illusion—you know", laughed Laurie, breaking down and
helping himself out of his quandary with the new word.
