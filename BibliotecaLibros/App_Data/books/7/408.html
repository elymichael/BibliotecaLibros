<br/>"We have our plans. We don't mean to say much about them yet,<br/>because we are such very new brooms, but we don't intend to be<br/>idle. I'm going into business with a devotion that shall delight<br/>Grandfather, and prove to him that I'm not spoiled. I need<br/>something of the sort to keep me steady. I'm tired of dawdling, and<br/>mean to work like a man."<br/><br/>"And Amy, what is she going to do?" asked Mrs. March, well<br/>pleased at Laurie's decision and the energy with which he<br/>spoke.<br/><br/>"After doing the civil all round, and airing our best bonnet, we<br/>shall astonish you by the elegant hospitalities of our mansion, the<br/>brilliant society we shall draw about us, and the beneficial<br/>influence we shall exert over the world at large.

Happy Amy!" and Jo sighed, then smiled brightly<br/>as Professor Bhaer opened the gate with an impatient push.<br/><br/>Later in the evening, when his mind had been set at rest about<br/>the bootjack, Laurie said suddenly to his wife, "Mrs.<br/>Laurence."<br/><br/>"My Lord!"<br/><br/>"That man intends to marry our Jo!"<br/><br/>
