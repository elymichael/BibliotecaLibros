<br/>It was certainly proposing under difficulties, for even if he<br/>had desired to do so, Mr. Bhaer could not go down upon his knees,<br/>on account of the mud. Neither could he offer Jo his hand, except<br/>figuratively, for both were full. Much less could he indulge in<br/>tender remonstrations in the open street, though he was near it. So<br/>the only way in which he could express his rapture was to look at<br/>her, with an expression which glorified his face to such a degree<br/>that there actually seemed to be little rainbows in the drops that<br/>sparkled on his beard. If he had not loved Jo very much, I don't<br/>think he could have done it then, for she looked far from lovely,<br/>with her skirts in a deplorable state, her rubber boots splashed to<br/>the ankle, and her bonnet a ruin. Fortunately, Mr. Bhaer considered<br/>her the most beautiful woman living, and she found him more<br/>"Jove-like" than ever, though his hatbrim was quite limp with the<br/>little rills trickling thence upon his shoulders (for he held the<br/>umbrella all over Jo), and every finger of his gloves needed<br/>mending.<br/><br/>Passers-by probably thought them a pair of harmless lunatics,<br/>for they entirely forgot to hail a bus, and strolled leisurely<br/>along, oblivious of deepening dusk and fog. Little they cared what<br/>anybody thought, for they were enjoying the happy hour that seldom<br/>comes but once in any life, the magical moment which bestows youth<br/>on the old, beauty on the plain, wealth on the poor, and gives<br/>human hearts a foretaste of heaven. The Professor looked as if he<br/>had conquered a kingdom, and the world had nothing more to offer<br/>him in the way of bliss. While Jo trudged beside him, feeling as if<br/>her place had always been there, and wondering how she ever could<br/>have chosen any other lot. Of course, she was the first to<br/>speak—intelligibly, I mean, for the emotional remarks which<br/>followed her impetuous "Oh, yes!" were not of a coherent or<br/>reportable character.<br/><br/>"Friedrich, why didn't you… "<br/><br/>"Ah, heaven, she gifs me the name that no one speaks since Minna<br/>died!" cried the Professor, pausing in a puddle to regard her with<br/>grateful delight.<br/><br/>"I always call you so to myself—I forgot, but I won't unless you<br/>like it."<br/><br/>"Like it? It is more sweet to me than I can tell. Say 'thou',<br/>also, and I shall say your language is almost as beautiful as<br/>mine."<br/><br/>"Isn't 'thou' a little sentimental?" asked Jo, privately<br/>thinking it a lovely monosyllable.<br/><br/>"Sentimental? Yes. Thank Gott, we Germans believe in sentiment,<br/>and keep ourselves young mit it. Your English 'you' is so cold, say<br/>'thou', heart's dearest, it means so much to me," pleaded Mr.<br/>Bhaer, more like a romantic student than a grave professor.<br/><br/>"Well, then, why didn't thou tell me all this sooner?" asked Jo<br/>bashfully.<br/><br/>"Now I shall haf to show thee all my heart, and I so gladly<br/>will, because thou must take care of it hereafter. See, then, my<br/>Jo—ah, the dear, funny little name—I had a wish to tell something<br/>the day I said goodbye in New York, but I thought the handsome<br/>friend was betrothed to thee, and so I spoke not. Wouldst thou have<br/>said 'Yes', then, if I had spoken?"<br/><br/>
