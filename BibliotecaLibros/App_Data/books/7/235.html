<br/>Here was another fine chance to make the crushing speech and the<br/>stately exit, but Meg never thought of doing either, and disgraced<br/>herself forever in Jo's eyes by meekly whispering, "Yes, John," and<br/>hiding her face on Mr. Brooke's waistcoat.<br/><br/>Fifteen minutes after Aunt March's departure, Jo came softly<br/>downstairs, paused an instant at the parlor door, and hearing no<br/>sound within, nodded and smiled with a satisfied expression, saying<br/>to herself, "She has seen him away as we planned, and that affair<br/>is settled. I'll go and hear the fun, and have a good laugh over<br/>it."<br/><br/>But poor Jo never got her laugh, for she was transfixed upon the<br/>threshold by a spectacle which held her there, staring with her<br/>mouth nearly as wide open as her eyes. Going in to exult over a<br/>fallen enemy and to praise a strong-minded sister for the<br/>banishment of an objectionable lover, it certainly was a shock to<br/>behold the aforesaid enemy serenely sitting on the sofa, with the<br/>strongminded sister enthroned upon his knee and wearing an<br/>expression of the most abject submission. Jo gave a sort of gasp,<br/>as if a cold shower bath had suddenly fallen upon her, for such an<br/>unexpected turning of the tables actually took her breath away. At<br/>the odd sound the lovers turned and saw her. Meg jumped up, looking<br/>both proud and shy, but 'that man', as Jo called him, actually<br/>laughed and said coolly, as he kissed the astonished newcomer,<br/>"Sister Jo, congratulate us!"<br/><br/>That was adding insult to injury, it was altogether too much,<br/>and making some wild demonstration with her hands, Jo vanished<br/>without a word. Rushing upstairs, she startled the invalids by<br/>exclaiming tragically as she burst into the room, "Oh, do somebody<br/>go down quick! John Brooke is acting dreadfully, and Meg likes<br/>it!"<br/><br/>Mr. and Mrs. March left the room with speed, and casting herself<br/>upon the bed, Jo cried and scolded tempestuously as she told the<br/>awful news to Beth and Amy. The little girls, however, considered<br/>it a most agreeable and interesting event, and Jo got little<br/>comfort from them, so she went up to her refuge in the garret, and<br/>confided her troubles to the rats.<br/><br/>Nobody ever knew what went on in the parlor that afternoon, but<br/>a great deal of talking was done, and quiet Mr. Brooke astonished<br/>his friends by the eloquence and spirit with which he pleaded his<br/>suit, told his plans, and persuaded them to arrange everything just<br/>as he wanted it.<br/><br/>The tea bell rang before he had finished describing the paradise<br/>which he meant to earn for Meg, and he proudly took her in to<br/>supper, both looking so happy that Jo hadn't the heart to be<br/>jealous or dismal. Amy was very much impressed by John's devotion<br/>and Meg's dignity, Beth beamed at them from a distance, while Mr.<br/>and Mrs. March surveyed the young couple with such tender<br/>satisfaction that it was perfectly evident Aunt March was right in<br/>calling them as 'unworldly as a pair of babies'. No one ate much,<br/>but everyone looked very happy, and the old room seemed to brighten<br/>up amazingly when the first romance of the family began there.<br/><br/>"You can't say nothing pleasant ever happens now, can you, Meg?"<br/>said Amy, trying to decide how she would group the lovers in a<br/>sketch she was planning to make.<br/><br/>"No, I'm sure I can't. How much has happened since I said that!<br/>It seems a year ago," answered Meg, who was in a blissful dream<br/>lifted far above such common things as bread and butter.<br/><br/>"The joys come close upon the sorrows this time, and I rather<br/>think the changes have begun," said Mrs. March. "In most families<br/>there comes, now and then, a year full of events. This has been<br/>such a one, but it ends well, after all."<br/><br/>
