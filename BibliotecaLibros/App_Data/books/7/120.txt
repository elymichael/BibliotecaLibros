"Then let me advise you to take up your little burdens again,
for though they seem heavy sometimes, they are good for us, and
lighten as we learn to carry them. Work is wholesome, and there is
plenty for everyone. It keeps us from ennui and mischief, is good
for health and spirits, and gives us a sense of power and
independence better than money or fashion."

dinner party I have shall be a success."

"I'll make the set of shirts for father, instead of letting you
do it, Marmee. I can and I will, though I'm not fond of sewing.
That will be better than fussing over my own things, which are
plenty nice enough as they are." said Meg.

"I'll do my lessons every day, and not spend so much time with
my music and dolls. I am a stupid thing, and ought to be studying,
not playing," was Beth's resolution, while Amy followed their

buttonholes, and attend to my parts of speech."

"Very good! Then I am quite satisfied with the experiment, and
fancy that we shall not have to repeat it, only don't go to the
other extreme and delve like slaves. Have regular hours for work
and play, make each day both useful and pleasant, and prove that
you understand the worth of time by employing it well. Then youth
will be delightful, old age will bring few regrets, and life become
a beautiful success, in spite of poverty."

"We'll remember, Mother!" and they did.
