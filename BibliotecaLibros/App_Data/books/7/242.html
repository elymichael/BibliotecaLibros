What happy times they had planning together, what solemn<br/>shopping excursions, what funny mistakes they made, and what shouts<br/>of laughter arose over Laurie's ridiculous bargains. In his love of<br/>jokes, this young gentleman, though nearly through college, was a<br/>much of a boy as ever. His last whim had been to bring with him on<br/>his weekly visits some new, useful, and ingenious article for the<br/>young housekeeper. Now a bag of remarkable clothespins, next, a<br/>wonderful nutmeg grater which fell to pieces at the first trial, a<br/>knife cleaner that spoiled all the knives, or a sweeper that picked<br/>the nap neatly off the carpet and left the dirt, labor-saving soap<br/>that took the skin off one's hands, infallible cements which stuck<br/>firmly to nothing but the fingers of the deluded buyer, and every<br/>kind of tinware, from a toy savings bank for odd pennies, to a<br/>wonderful boiler which would wash articles in its own steam with<br/>every prospect of exploding in the process.<br/><br/>In vain Meg begged him to stop. John laughed at him, and Jo<br/>called him 'Mr. Toodles'. He was possessed with a mania for<br/>patronizing Yankee ingenuity, and seeing his friends fitly<br/>furnished forth. So each week beheld some fresh absurdity.<br/><br/>Everything was done at last, even to Amy's arranging different<br/>colored soaps to match the different colored rooms, and Beth's<br/>setting the table for the first meal.<br/><br/>"Are you satisfied? Does it seem like home, and do you feel as<br/>if you should be happy here?" asked Mrs. March, as she and her<br/>daughter went through the new kingdom arm in arm, for just then<br/>they seemed to cling together more tenderly than ever.<br/><br/>"Yes, Mother, perfectly satisfied, thanks to you all, and so<br/>happy that I can't talk about it," with a look that was far better<br/>than words.<br/><br/>"If she only had a servant or two it would be all right," said<br/>Amy, coming out of the parlor, where she had been trying to decide<br/>whether the bronze Mercury looked best on the whatnot or the<br/>mantlepiece.<br/><br/>"Mother and I have talked that over, and I have made up my mind<br/>to try her way first. There will be so little to do that with Lotty<br/>to run my errands and help me here and there, I shall only have<br/>enough work to keep me from getting lazy or homesick," answered Meg<br/>tranquilly.<br/><br/>"Sallie Moffat has four," began Amy.<br/><br/>"If Meg had four, the house wouldn't hold them, and master and<br/>missis would have to camp in the garden," broke in Jo, who,<br/>enveloped in a big blue pinafore, was giving the last polish to the<br/>door handles.<br/><br/>"Sallie isn't a poor man's wife, and many maids are in keeping<br/>with her fine establishment. Meg and John begin humbly, but I have<br/>a feeling that there will be quite as much happiness in the little<br/>house as in the big one. It's a great mistake for young girls like<br/>Meg to leave themselves nothing to do but dress, give orders, and<br/>gossip. When I was first married, I used to long for my new clothes<br/>to wear out or get torn, so that I might have the pleasure of<br/>mending them, for I got heartily sick of doing fancywork and<br/>tending my pocket handkerchief."<br/><br/>"Why didn't you go into the kitchen and make messes, as Sallie<br/>says she does to amuse herself, though they never turn out well and<br/>the servants laugh at her," said Meg.<br/>
