"How many young ladies are there?" asked her mother, beginning
to look sober.

"Twelve or fourteen in the class, but I dare say they won't all
come."

"Bless me, child, you will have to charter an omnibus to carry
them about."

"Why, Mother, how can you think of such a thing? Not more than
six or eight will probably come, so I shall hire a beach wagon and
borrow Mr. Laurence's cherry-bounce." (Hannah's pronunciation of
char-a-banc.)

"All of this will be expensive, Amy."

"Not very. I've calculated the cost, and I'll pay for it
myself."

"Don't you think, dear, that as these girls are used to such
things, and the best we can do will be nothing new, that some
simpler plan would be pleasanter to them, as a change if nothing
more, and much better for us than buying or borrowing what we don't
need, and attempting a style not in keeping with our
circumstances?"

"If I can't have it as I like, I don't care to have it at all. I
know that I can carry it out perfectly well, if you and the girls
will help a little, and I don't see why I can't if I'm willing to
pay for it," said Amy, with the decision which opposition was apt
to change into obstinacy.

Mrs. March knew that experience was an excellent teacher, and
when it was possible she left her children to learn alone the
lessons which she would gladly have made easier, if they had not
objected to taking advice as much as they did salts and senna.

"Very well, Amy, if your heart is set upon it, and you see your
way through without too great an outlay of money, time, and temper,
I'll say no more. Talk it over with the girls, and whichever way
you decide, I'll do my best to help you."

"Thanks, Mother, you are always so kind." and away went Amy to
lay her plan before her sisters.
