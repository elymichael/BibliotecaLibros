<br/>"Now, then, mum?"<br/><br/>I gave my order as soberly as I could, and<br/>slamming down the door, with an "Aye, aye, mum," the man made his<br/>horse walk, as if going to a funeral. I poked again and said, "A<br/>little faster," then off he went, helter-skelter as before, and we<br/>resigned ourselves to our fate.<br/><br/>Today was fair, and we went to Hyde Park, close<br/>by, for we are more aristocratic than we look. The Duke of<br/>Devonshire lives near. I often see his footmen lounging at the back<br/>gate, and the Duke of Wellington's house is not far off. Such<br/>sights as I saw, my dear! It was as good as Punch, for there were<br/>fat dowagers rolling about in their red and yellow coaches, with<br/>gorgeous Jeameses in silk stockings and velvet coats, up behind,<br/>and powdered coachmen in front. Smart maids, with the rosiest<br/>children I ever saw, handsome girls, looking half asleep, dandies<br/>in queer English hats and lavender kids lounging about, and tall<br/>soldiers, in short red jackets and muffin caps stuck on one side,<br/>looking so funny I longed to sketch them.<br/><br/>Rotten Row means 'Route de Roi', or the king's<br/>way, but now it's more like a riding school than anything else. The<br/>horses are splendid, and the men, especially the grooms, ride well,<br/>but the women are stiff, and bounce, which isn't according to our<br/>rules. I longed to show them a tearing American gallop, for they<br/>trotted solemnly up and down, in their scant habits and high hats,<br/>looking like the women in a toy Noah's Ark. Everyone rides—old men,<br/>stout ladies, little children—and the young folks do a deal of<br/>flirting here, I saw a pair exchange rose buds, for it's the thing<br/>to wear one in the button-hole, and I thought it rather a nice<br/>little idea.<br/><br/>In the P.M. to Westminster Abbey, but don't<br/>expect me to describe it, that's impossible, so I'll only say it<br/>was sublime! This evening we are going to see Fechter, which will<br/>be an appropriate end to the happiest day of my life.<br/><br/>It's very late, but I can't let my letter go in<br/>the morning without telling you what happened last evening. Who do<br/>you think came in, as we were at tea? Laurie's English friends,<br/>Fred and Frank Vaughn! I was so surprised, for I shouldn't have<br/>known them but for the cards. Both are tall fellows with whiskers,<br/>Fred handsome in the English style, and Frank much better, for he<br/>only limps slightly, and uses no crutches. They had heard from<br/>Laurie where we were to be, and came to ask us to their house, but<br/>Uncle won't go, so we shall return the call, and see them as we<br/>can. They went to the theater with us, and we did have such a good<br/>time, for Frank devoted himself to Flo, and Fred and I talked over<br/>past, present, and future fun as if we had known each other all our<br/>days. Tell Beth Frank asked for her, and was sorry to hear of her<br/>ill health. Fred laughed when I spoke of Jo, and sent his<br/>'respectful compliments to the big hat'. Neither of them had<br/>forgotten Camp Laurence, or the fun we had there. What ages ago it<br/>seems, doesn't it?<br/><br/>Aunt is tapping on the wall for the third time,<br/>so I must stop. I really feel like a dissipated London fine lady,<br/>writing here so late, with my room full of pretty things, and my<br/>head a jumble of parks, theaters, new gowns, and gallant creatures<br/>who say "Ah!" and twirl their blond mustaches with the true English<br/>lordliness. I long to see you all, and in spite of my nonsense am,<br/>as ever, your loving…<br/><br/>AMY<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>PARIS<br/><br/>
