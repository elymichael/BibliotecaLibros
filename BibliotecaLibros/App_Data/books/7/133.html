"Well, I think Truth is a very silly play. Let's have a sensible<br/>game of Authors to refresh our minds," proposed Jo.<br/><br/>Ned, Frank, and the little girls joined in this, and while it<br/>went on, the three elders sat apart, talking. Miss Kate took out<br/>her sketch again, and Margaret watched her, while Mr. Brooke lay on<br/>the grass with a book, which he did not read.<br/><br/>"How beautifully you do it! I wish I could draw," said Meg, with<br/>mingled admiration and regret in her voice.<br/><br/>"Why don't you learn? I should think you had taste and talent<br/>for it," replied Miss Kate graciously.<br/><br/>"I haven't time."<br/><br/>"Your mamma prefers other accomplishments, I fancy. So did mine,<br/>but I proved to her that I had talent by taking a few lessons<br/>privately, and then she was quite willing I should go on. Can't you<br/>do the same with your governess?"<br/><br/>"I have none."<br/><br/>"I forgot young ladies in America go to school more than with<br/>us. Very fine schools they are, too, Papa says. You go to a private<br/>one, I suppose?"<br/><br/>"I don't go at all. I am a governess myself."<br/><br/>"Oh, indeed!" said Miss Kate, but she might as well have said,<br/>"Dear me, how dreadful!" for her tone implied it, and something in<br/>her face made Meg color, and wish she had not been so frank.<br/><br/>Mr. Brooke looked up and said quickly, "Young ladies in America<br/>love independence as much as their ancestors did, and are admired<br/>and respected for supporting themselves."<br/>
