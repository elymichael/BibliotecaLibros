"Now then, we must walk her home as fast as we can. Pile our<br/>things on her, while I get off these confounded skates," cried<br/>Laurie, wrapping his coat round Amy, and tugging away at the straps<br/>which never seemed so intricate before.<br/><br/>Shivering, dripping, and crying, they got Amy home, and after an<br/>exciting time of it, she fell asleep, rolled in blankets before a<br/>hot fire. During the bustle Jo had scarcely spoken but flown about,<br/>looking pale and wild, with her things half off, her dress torn,<br/>and her hands cut and bruised by ice and rails and refractory<br/>buckles. When Amy was comfortably asleep, the house quiet, and Mrs.<br/>March sitting by the bed, she called Jo to her and began to bind up<br/>the hurt hands.<br/><br/>"Are you sure she is safe?" whispered Jo, looking remorsefully<br/>at the golden head, which might have been swept away from her sight<br/>forever under the treacherous ice.<br/><br/>"Quite safe, dear. She is not hurt, and won't even take cold, I<br/>think, you were so sensible in covering and getting her home<br/>quickly," replied her mother cheerfully.<br/><br/>"Laurie did it all. I only let her go. Mother, if she should<br/>die, it would be my fault." And Jo dropped down beside the bed in a<br/>passion of penitent tears, telling all that had happened, bitterly<br/>condemning her hardness of heart, and sobbing out her gratitude for<br/>being spared the heavy punishment which might have come upon<br/>her.<br/><br/>"It's my dreadful temper! I try to cure it, I think I have, and<br/>then it breaks out worse than ever. Oh, Mother, what shall I do?<br/>What shall I do?" cried poor Jo, in despair.<br/><br/>"Watch and pray, dear, never get tired of trying, and never<br/>think it is impossible to conquer your fault," said Mrs. March,<br/>drawing the blowzy head to her shoulder and kissing the wet cheek<br/>so tenderly that Jo cried even harder.<br/><br/>"You don't know, you can't guess how bad it is! It seems as if I<br/>could do anything when I'm in a passion. I get so savage, I could<br/>hurt anyone and enjoy it. I'm afraid I shall do something dreadful<br/>some day, and spoil my life, and make everybody hate me. Oh,<br/>Mother, help me, do help me!"<br/><br/>"I will, my child, I will. Don't cry so bitterly, but remember<br/>this day, and resolve with all your soul that you will never know<br/>another like it. Jo, dear, we all have our temptations, some far<br/>greater than yours, and it often takes us all our lives to conquer<br/>them. You think your temper is the worst in the world, but mine<br/>used to be just like it."<br/><br/>"Yours, Mother? Why, you are never angry!" And for the moment Jo<br/>forgot remorse in surprise.<br/><br/>"I've been trying to cure it for forty years, and have only<br/>succeeded in controlling it. I am angry nearly every day of my<br/>life, Jo, but I have learned not to show it, and I still hope to<br/>learn not to feel it, though it may take me another forty years to<br/>do so."<br/>
