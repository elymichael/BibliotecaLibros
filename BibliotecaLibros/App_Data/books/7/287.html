<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>7<br/>Consequences<br/><br/><br/>Mrs. Chester's fair was so very elegant and select that it was<br/>considered a great honor by the young ladies of the neighborhood to<br/>be invited to take a table, and everyone was much interested in the<br/>matter. Amy was asked, but Jo was not, which was fortunate for all<br/>parties, as her elbows were decidedly akimbo at this period of her<br/>life, and it took a good many hard knocks to teach her how to get<br/>on easily. The 'haughty, uninteresting creature' was let severely<br/>alone, but Amy's talent and taste were duly complimented by the<br/>offer of the art table, and she exerted herself to prepare and<br/>secure appropriate and valuable contributions to it.<br/><br/>Everything went on smoothly till the day before the fair opened,<br/>then there occurred one of the little skirmishes which it is almost<br/>impossible to avoid, when some five-and-twenty women, old and<br/>young, with all their private piques and prejudices, try to work<br/>together.<br/><br/>May Chester was rather jealous of Amy because the latter was a<br/>greater favorite than herself, and just at this time several<br/>trifling circumstances occurred to increase the feeling. Amy's<br/>dainty pen-and-ink work entirely eclipsed May's painted vases—that<br/>was one thorn. Then the all conquering Tudor had danced four times<br/>with Amy at a late party and only once with May—that was thorn<br/>number two. But the chief grievance that rankled in her soul, and<br/>gave an excuse for her unfriendly conduct, was a rumor which some<br/>obliging gossip had whispered to her, that the March girls had made<br/>fun of her at the Lambs'. All the blame of this should have fallen<br/>upon Jo, for her naughty imitation had been too lifelike to escape<br/>detection, and the frolicsome Lambs had permitted the joke to<br/>escape. No hint of this had reached the culprits, however, and<br/>Amy's dismay can be imagined, when, the very evening before the<br/>fair, as she was putting the last touches to her pretty table, Mrs.<br/>Chester, who, of course, resented the supposed ridicule of her<br/>daughter, said, in a bland tone, but with a cold look…<br/><br/>"I find, dear, that there is some feeling among the young ladies<br/>about my giving this table to anyone but my girls. As this is the<br/>most prominent, and some say the most attractive table of all, and<br/>they are the chief getters-up of the fair, it is thought best for<br/>them to take this place. I'm sorry, but I know you are too<br/>sincerely interested in the cause to mind a little personal<br/>disappointment, and you shall have another table if you like."<br/><br/>Mrs. Chester fancied beforehand that it would be easy to deliver<br/>this little speech, but when the time came, she found it rather<br/>difficult to utter it naturally, with Amy's unsuspicious eyes<br/>looking straight at her full of surprise and trouble.<br/><br/>Amy felt that there was something behind this, but could not<br/>guess what, and said quietly, feeling hurt, and showing that she<br/>did, "Perhaps you had rather I took no table at all?"<br/><br/>"Now, my dear, don't have any ill feeling, I beg. It's merely a<br/>matter of expediency, you see, my girls will naturally take the<br/>lead, and this table is considered their proper place. I think it<br/>very appropriate to you, and feel very grateful for your efforts to<br/>make it so pretty, but we must give up our private wishes, of<br/>course, and I will see that you have a good place elsewhere.<br/>Wouldn't you like the flower table? The little girls undertook it,<br/>but they are discouraged. You could make a charming thing of it,<br/>and the flower table is always attractive you know."<br/>
