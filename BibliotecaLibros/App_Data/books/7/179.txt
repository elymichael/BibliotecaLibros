Dear Madam:

The little girls are all well. Beth and my boy
report daily. Hannah is a model servant, and guards pretty Meg like
a dragon. Glad the fine weather holds. Pray make Brooke useful, and
draw on me for funds if expenses exceed your estimate. Don't let
your husband want anything. Thank God he is mending.

Your sincere friend and servant, JAMES
LAURENCE
