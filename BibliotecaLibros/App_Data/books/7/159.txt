"What in the world are you doing here?" she asked, regarding her
disheveled sister with well-bred surprise.

"Getting leaves," meekly answered Jo, sorting the rosy handful
she had just swept up.

"And hairpins," added Laurie, throwing half a dozen into Jo's
lap. "They grow on this road, Meg, so do combs and brown straw
hats."

"You have been running, Jo. How could you? When will you stop
such romping ways?" said Meg reprovingly, as she settled her cuffs
and smoothed her hair, with which the wind had taken liberties.

"Never till I'm stiff and old and have to use a crutch. Don't
try to make me grow up before my time, Meg. It's hard enough to
have you change all of a sudden. Let me be a little girl as long as
I can."

As she spoke, Jo bent over the leaves to hide the trembling of
her lips, for lately she had felt that Margaret was fast getting to
be a woman, and Laurie's secret made her dread the separation which
must surely come some time and now seemed very near. He saw the
trouble in her face and drew Meg's attention from it by asking
quickly, "Where have you been calling, all so fine?"

"At the Gardiners', and Sallie has been telling me all about
Belle Moffat's wedding. It was very splendid, and they have gone to
spend the winter in Paris. Just think how delightful that must
be!"

"Do you envy her, Meg?" said Laurie.

"I'm afraid I do."

"I'm glad of it!" muttered Jo, tying on her hat with a jerk.
