Estelle Valnor, Theodore Laurence.


The last name was written in pencil, and Amy explained that he
was to rewrite it in ink and seal it up for her properly.

"What put it into your head? Did anyone tell you about Beth's
giving away her things?" asked Laurie soberly, as Amy laid a bit of
red tape, with sealing wax, a taper, and a standish before him.

She explained and then asked anxiously, "What about Beth?"

"I'm sorry I spoke, but as I did, I'll tell you. She felt so ill
one day that she told Jo she wanted to give her piano to Meg, her
cats to you, and the poor old doll to Jo, who would love it for her
sake. She was sorry she had so little to give, and left locks of
hair to the rest of us, and her best love to Grandpa. She never
thought of a will."

Laurie was signing and sealing as he spoke, and did not look up
till a great tear dropped on the paper. Amy's face was full of
trouble, but she only said, "Don't people put sort of postscripts
to their wills, sometimes?"

"Yes, 'codicils', they call them."

"Put one in mine then, that I wish all my curls cut off, and
given round to my friends. I forgot it, but I want it done though
it will spoil my looks."

Laurie added it, smiling at Amy's last and greatest sacrifice.
Then he amused her for an hour, and was much interested in all her
trials. But when he came to go, Amy held him back to whisper with
trembling lips, "Is there really any danger about Beth?"

"I'm afraid there is, but we must hope for the best, so don't
cry, dear." And Laurie put his arm about her with a brotherly
gesture which was very comforting.
