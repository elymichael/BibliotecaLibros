, up in the apple<br/>tree. Beth began by rummaging everything out of the big closet<br/>where her family resided, but getting tired before half done, she<br/>left her establishment topsy-turvy and went to her music, rejoicing<br/>that she had no dishes to wash. Amy arranged her bower, put on her<br/>best white frock, smoothed her curls, and sat down to draw under<br/>the honeysuckle, hoping someone would see and inquire who the young<br/>artist was. As no one appeared but an inquisitive daddy-longlegs,<br/>who examined her work with interest, she went to walk, got caught<br/>in a shower, and came home dripping.<br/><br/>At teatime they compared notes, and all agreed that it had been<br/>a delightful, though unusually long day. Meg, who went shopping in<br/>the afternoon and got a 'sweet blue muslin', had discovered, after<br/>she had cut the breadths off, that it wouldn't wash, which mishap<br/>made her slightly cross. Jo had burned the skin off her nose<br/>boating, and got a raging headache by reading too long. Beth was<br/>worried by the confusion of her closet and the difficulty of<br/>learning three or four songs at once, and Amy deeply regretted the<br/>damage done her frock, for Katy Brown's party was to be the next<br/>day and now like Flora McFlimsey, she had 'nothing to wear'. But<br/>these were mere trifles, and they assured their mother that the<br/>experiment was working finely. She smiled, said nothing, and with<br/>Hannah's help did their neglected work, keeping home pleasant and<br/>the domestic machinery running smoothly. It was astonishing what a<br/>peculiar and uncomfortable state of things was produced by the<br/>'resting and reveling' process. The days kept getting longer and<br/>longer, the weather was unusually variable and so were tempers; an<br/>unsettled feeling possessed everyone, and Satan found plenty of<br/>mischief for the idle hands to do. As the height of luxury, Meg put<br/>out some of her sewing, and then found time hang so heavily, that<br/>she fell to snipping and spoiling her clothes in her attempts to<br/>furbish them up a la Moffat. Jo read till her eyes gave out and she<br/>was sick of books, got so fidgety that even good-natured Laurie had<br/>a quarrel with her, and so reduced in spirits that she desperately<br/>wished she had gone with Aunt March. Beth got on pretty well, for<br/>she was constantly forgetting that it was to be all play and no<br/>work, and fell back into her old ways now and then. But something<br/>in the air affected her, and more than once her tranquility was<br/>much disturbed, so much so that on one occasion she actually shook<br/>poor dear Joanna and told her she was 'a fright'. Amy fared worst<br/>of all, for her resources were small, and when her sisters left her<br/>to amuse herself, she soon found that accomplished and important<br/>little self a great burden. She didn't like dolls, fairy tales were<br/>childish, and one couldn't draw all the time. Tea parties didn't<br/>amount to much, neither did picnics, unless very well conducted.<br/>"If one could have a fine house, full of nice girls, or go<br/>traveling, the summer would be delightful, but to stay at home with<br/>three selfish sisters and a grown-up boy was enough to try the<br/>patience of a Boaz," complained Miss Malaprop, after several days<br/>devoted to pleasure, fretting, and ennui.<br/><br/>No one would own that they were tired of the experiment, but by<br/>Friday night each acknowledged to herself that she was glad the<br/>week was nearly done. Hoping to impress the lesson more deeply,<br/>Mrs. March, who had a good deal of humor, resolved to finish off<br/>the trial in an appropriate manner, so she gave Hannah a holiday<br/>and let the girls enjoy the full effect of the play system.<br/><br/>When they got up on Saturday morning, there was no fire in the<br/>kitchen, no breakfast in the dining room, and no mother anywhere to<br/>be seen.<br/><br/>"Mercy on us! What has happened?" cried Jo, staring about her in<br/>dismay.<br/><br/>Meg ran upstairs and soon came back again, looking relieved but<br/>rather bewildered, and a little ashamed.<br/><br/>"Mother isn't sick, only very tired, and she says she is going<br/>to stay quietly in her room all day and let us do the best we can.<br/>It's a very queer thing for her to do, she doesn't act a bit like<br/>herself. But she says it has been a hard week for her, so we<br/>mustn't grumble but take care of ourselves."<br/><br/>"That's easy enough, and I like the idea, I'm aching for<br/>something to do, that is, some new amusement, you know," added Jo<br/>quickly.<br/><br/>In fact it was an immense relief to them all to have a little<br/>work, and they took hold with a will, but soon realized the truth<br/>of Hannah's saying, "Housekeeping ain't no joke." There was plenty<br/>of food in the larder, and while Beth and Amy set the table, Meg<br/>and Jo got breakfast, wondering as they did why servants ever<br/>talked about hard work.<br/><br/>"I shall take some up to Mother, though she said we were not to<br/>think of her, for she'd take care of herself," said Meg, who<br/>presided and felt quite matronly behind the teapot.<br/><br/>So a tray was fitted out before anyone began, and taken up with<br/>the cook's compliments. The boiled tea was very bitter, the omelet<br/>scorched, and the biscuits speckled with saleratus, but Mrs. March<br/>received her repast with thanks and laughed heartily over it after<br/>Jo was gone.<br/>
