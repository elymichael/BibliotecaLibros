"I'll go and tell Amy," said Meg, feeling a little hurt, yet
rather relieved on the whole, for she did not like nursing, and Jo
did.

Amy rebelled outright, and passionately declared that she had
rather have the fever than go to Aunt March. Meg reasoned, pleaded,
and commanded, all in vain. Amy protested that she would not go,
and Meg left her in despair to ask Hannah what should be done.
Before she came back, Laurie walked into the parlor to find Amy
sobbing, with her head in the sofa cushions. She told her story,
expecting to be consoled, but Laurie only put his hands in his
pockets and walked about the room, whistling softly, as he knit his
brows in deep thought. Presently he sat down beside her, and said,
in his most wheedlesome tone, "Now be a sensible little woman, and
do as they say. No, don't cry, but hear what a jolly plan I've got.
You go to Aunt March's, and I'll come and take you out every day,
driving or walking, and we'll have capital times. Won't that be
better than moping here?"

"I don't wish to be sent off as if I was in the way," began Amy,
in an injured voice.

"Bless your heart, child, it's to keep you well. You don't want
to be sick, do you?"

"No, I'm sure I don't, but I dare say I shall be, for I've been
with Beth all the time."

"That's the very reason you ought to go away at once, so that
you may escape it. Change of air and care will keep you well, I
dare say, or if it does not entirely, you will have the fever more
lightly. I advise you to be off as soon as you can, for scarlet
fever is no joke, miss."

"But it's dull at Aunt March's, and she is so cross," said Amy,
looking rather frightened.

"It won't be dull with me popping in every day to tell you how
Beth is, and take you out gallivanting. The old lady likes me, and
I'll be as sweet as possible to her, so she won't peck at us,
whatever we do."

"Will you take me out in the trotting wagon with Puck?"

"On my honor as a gentleman."

"And come every single day?"
