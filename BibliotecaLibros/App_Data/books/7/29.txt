"How is your cat, Miss March?" asked the boy, trying to look
sober while his black eyes shone with fun.

"Nicely, thank you, Mr. Laurence. But I am not Miss March, I'm
only Jo," returned the young lady.

"I'm not Mr. Laurence, I'm only Laurie."

"Laurie Laurence, what an odd name."

"My first name is Theodore, but I don't like it, for the fellows
called me Dora, so I made them say Laurie instead."

"I hate my name, too, so sentimental! I wish every one would say
Jo instead of Josephine. How did you make the boys stop calling you
Dora?"

"I thrashed 'em."

"I can't thrash Aunt March, so I suppose I shall have to bear
it." And Jo resigned herself with a sigh.

"Don't you like to dance, Miss Jo?" asked Laurie, looking as if
he thought the name suited her.

"I like it well enough if there is plenty of room, and everyone
is lively. In a place like this I'm sure to upset something, tread
on people's toes, or do something dreadful, so I keep out of
mischief and let Meg sail about. Don't you dance?"
