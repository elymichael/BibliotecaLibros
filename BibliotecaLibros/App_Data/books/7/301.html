must<br/>&#160;marry<br/>well. Meg didn't, Jo won't, Beth can't yet, so I shall, and make<br/>everything okay all round. I wouldn't marry a man I hated or<br/>despised. You may be sure of that, and though Fred is not my model<br/>hero, he does very well, and in time I should get fond enough of<br/>him if he was very fond of me, and let me do just as I liked. So<br/>I've been turning the matter over in my mind the last week, for it<br/>was impossible to help seeing that Fred liked me. He said nothing,<br/>but little things showed it. He never goes with Flo, always gets on<br/>my side of the carriage, table, or promenade, looks sentimental<br/>when we are alone, and frowns at anyone else who ventures to speak<br/>to me. Yesterday at dinner, when an Austrian officer stared at us<br/>and then said something to his friend, a rakish-looking baron,<br/>about '<br/>ein wonderschones Blondchen'<br/>, Fred looked as fierce<br/>as a lion, and cut his meat so savagely it nearly flew off his<br/>plate. He isn't one of the cool, stiff Englishmen, but is rather<br/>peppery, for he has Scotch blood in him, as one might guess from<br/>his bonnie blue eyes.<br/><br/>Well, last evening we went up to the castle about<br/>sunset, at least all of us but Fred, who was to meet us there after<br/>going to the Post Restante for letters. We had a charming time<br/>poking about the ruins, the vaults where the monster tun is, and<br/>the beautiful gardens made by the elector long ago for his English<br/>wife. I liked the great terrace best, for the view was divine, so<br/>while the rest went to see the rooms inside, I sat there trying to<br/>sketch the gray stone lion's head on the wall, with scarlet<br/>woodbine sprays hanging round it. I felt as if I'd got into a<br/>romance, sitting there, watching the Neckar rolling through the<br/>valley, listening to the music of the Austrian band below, and<br/>waiting for my lover, like a real storybook girl. I had a feeling<br/>that something was going to happen and I was ready for it. I didn't<br/>feel blushy or quakey, but quite cool and only a little<br/>excited.<br/><br/>By-and-by I heard Fred's voice, and then he came<br/>hurrying through the great arch to find me. He looked so troubled<br/>that I forgot all about myself, and asked what the matter was. He<br/>said he'd just got a letter begging him to come home, for Frank was<br/>very ill. So he was going at once on the night train and only had<br/>time to say good-by. I was very sorry for him, and disappointed for<br/>myself, but only for a minute because he said, as he shook hands,<br/>and said it in a way that I could not mistake, "I shall soon come<br/>back, you won't forget me, Amy?"<br/><br/>I didn't promise, but I looked at him, and he<br/>seemed satisfied, and there was no time for anything but messages<br/>and good-byes, for he was off in an hour, and we all miss him very<br/>much. I know he wanted to speak, but I think, from something he<br/>once hinted, that he had promised his father not to do anything of<br/>the sort yet a while, for he is a rash boy, and the old gentleman<br/>dreads a foreign daughter-in-law. We shall soon meet in Rome, and<br/>then, if I don't change my mind, I'll say "Yes, thank you," when he<br/>says "Will you, please?"<br/><br/>Of course this is all&#160;<br/>very private<br/>,<br/>but I wished you to know what was going on. Don't be anxious about<br/>me, remember I am your 'prudent Amy', and be sure I will do nothing<br/>rashly. Send me as much advice as you like. I'll use it if I can. I<br/>wish I could see you for a good talk, Marmee. Love and trust<br/>me.<br/><br/>Ever your AMY<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
