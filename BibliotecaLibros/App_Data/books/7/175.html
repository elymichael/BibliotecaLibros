<br/>News from their father comforted the girls very much, for though<br/>dangerously ill, the presence of the best and tenderest of nurses<br/>had already done him good. Mr. Brooke sent a bulletin every day,<br/>and as the head of the family, Meg insisted on reading the<br/>dispatches, which grew more cheerful as the week passed. At first,<br/>everyone was eager to write, and plump envelopes were carefully<br/>poked into the letter box by one or other of the sisters, who felt<br/>rather important with their Washington correspondence. As one of<br/>these packets contained characteristic notes from the party, we<br/>will rob an imaginary mail, and read them.<br/><br/><br/>My dearest Mother:<br/><br/>It is impossible to tell you how happy your last<br/>letter made us, for the news was so good we couldn't help laughing<br/>and crying over it. How very kind Mr. Brooke is, and how fortunate<br/>that Mr. Laurence's business detains him near you so long, since he<br/>is so useful to you and Father. The girls are all as good as gold.<br/>Jo helps me with the sewing, and insists on doing all sorts of hard<br/>jobs. I should be afraid she might overdo, if I didn't know her<br/>'moral fit' wouldn't last long. Beth is as regular about her tasks<br/>as a clock, and never forgets what you told her. She grieves about<br/>Father, and looks sober except when she is at her little piano. Amy<br/>minds me nicely, and I take great care of her. She does her own<br/>hair, and I am teaching her to make buttonholes and mend her<br/>stockings. She tries very hard, and I know you will be pleased with<br/>her improvement when you come. Mr. Laurence watches over us like a<br/>motherly old hen, as Jo says, and Laurie is very kind and<br/>neighborly. He and Jo keep us merry, for we get pretty blue<br/>sometimes, and feel like orphans, with you so far away. Hannah is a<br/>perfect saint. She does not scold at all, and always calls me Miss<br/>Margaret, which is quite proper, you know, and treats me with<br/>respect. We are all well and busy, but we long, day and night, to<br/>have you back. Give my dearest love to Father, and believe me, ever<br/>your own…<br/><br/>MEG<br/><br/><br/>This note, prettily written on scented paper, was a great<br/>contrast to the next, which was scribbled on a big sheet of thin<br/>foreign paper, ornamented with blots and all manner of flourishes<br/>and curly-tailed letters.<br/><br/><br/>My precious Marmee:<br/><br/>Three cheers for dear Father! Brooke was a trump<br/>to telegraph right off, and let us know the minute he was better. I<br/>rushed up garret when the letter came, and tried to thank god for<br/>being so good to us, but I could only cry, and say, "I'm glad! I'm<br/>glad!" Didn't that do as well as a regular prayer? For I felt a<br/>great many in my heart. We have such funny times, and now I can<br/>enjoy them, for everyone is so desperately good, it's like living<br/>in a nest of turtledoves. You'd laugh to see Meg head the table and<br/>try to be motherish. She gets prettier every day, and I'm in love<br/>with her sometimes. The children are regular archangels, and<br/>I—well, I'm Jo, and never shall be anything else. Oh, I must tell<br/>you that I came near having a quarrel with Laurie. I freed my mind<br/>about a silly little thing, and he was offended. I was right, but<br/>didn't speak as I ought, and he marched home, saying he wouldn't<br/>come again till I begged pardon. I declared I wouldn't and got mad.<br/>It lasted all day. I felt bad and wanted you very much. Laurie and<br/>I are both so proud, it's hard to beg pardon. But I thought he'd<br/>come to it, for I was in the right. He didn't come, and just at<br/>night I remembered what you said when Amy fell into the river. I<br/>read my little book, felt better, resolved not to let the sun set<br/>on my anger, and ran over to tell Laurie I was sorry. I met him at<br/>the gate, coming for the same thing. We both laughed, begged each<br/>other's pardon, and felt all good and comfortable again.<br/><br/>I made a 'pome' yesterday, when I was helping<br/>Hannah wash, and as Father likes my silly little things, I put it<br/>in to amuse him. Give him my lovingest hug that ever was, and kiss<br/>yourself a dozen times for your…<br/><br/>TOPSY-TURVY JO<br/>
