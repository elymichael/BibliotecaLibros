"My rouge won't come off." and Amy rubbed her brilliant cheek,<br/>and showed him her white glove with a sober simplicity that made<br/>him laugh outright.<br/><br/>"What do you call this stuff?" he asked, touching a fold of her<br/>dress that had blown over his knee.<br/><br/>"Illusion."<br/><br/>"Good name for it. It's very pretty—new thing, isn't it?"<br/><br/>"It's as old as the hills.

I'd rather take coffee than<br/>compliments just now.
