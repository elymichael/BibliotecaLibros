"I shall marry whom I please, Aunt March, and you can leave your
money to anyone you like," she said, nodding her head with a
resolute air.

"Highty-tighty! Is that the way you take my advice, Miss? You'll
be sorry for it by-and-by, when you've tried love in a cottage and
found it a failure."

"It can't be a worse one than some people find in big houses,"
retorted Meg.

Aunt March put on her glasses and took a look at the girl, for
she did not know her in this new mood. Meg hardly knew herself, she
felt so brave and independent, so glad to defend John and assert
her right to love him, if she liked. Aunt March saw that she had
begun wrong, and after a little pause, made a fresh start, saying
as mildly as she could, "Now, Meg, my dear, be reasonable and take
my advice. I mean it kindly, and don't want you to spoil your whole
life by making a mistake at the beginning. You ought to marry well
and help your family. It's your duty to make a rich match and it
ought to be impressed upon you."

"Father and Mother don't think so. They like John though he is
poor."

"Your parents, my dear, have no more worldly wisdom than a pair
of babies."

"I'm glad of it," cried Meg stoutly.

Aunt March took no notice, but went on with her lecture. "This
Rook is poor and hasn't got any rich relations, has he?"

"No, but he has many warm friends."

"You can't live on friends, try it and see how cool they'll
grow. He hasn't any business, has he?"
