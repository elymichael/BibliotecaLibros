Meg Goes to Vanity Fair


"I do think it was the most fortunate thing in the world that
those children should have the measles just now," said Meg, one
April day, as she stood packing the 'go abroady' trunk in her room,
surrounded by her sisters.

"And so nice of Annie Moffat not to forget her promise. A whole
fortnight of fun will be regularly splendid," replied Jo, looking
like a windmill as she folded skirts with her long arms.

"And such lovely weather, I'm so glad of that," added Beth,
tidily sorting neck and hair ribbons in her best box, lent for the
great occasion.

"I wish I was going to have a fine time and wear all these nice
things," said Amy with her mouth full of pins, as she artistically
replenished her sister's cushion.

"I wish you were all going, but as you can't, I shall keep my
adventures to tell you when I come back. I'm sure it's the least I
can do when you have been so kind, lending me things and helping me
get ready," said Meg, glancing round the room at the very simple
outfit, which seemed nearly perfect in their eyes.

"What did Mother give you out of the treasure box?" asked Amy,
who had not been present at the opening of a certain cedar chest in
which Mrs. March kept a few relics of past splendor, as gifts for
her girls when the proper time came.

"A pair of silk stockings, that pretty carved fan, and a lovely
blue sash. I wanted the violet silk, but there isn't time to make
it over, so I must be contented with my old tarlaton."
