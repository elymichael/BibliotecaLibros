It was a very long day and a hard one for Amy, as she sat behind
her table, often quite alone, for the little girls deserted very
soon. Few cared to buy flowers in summer, and her bouquets began to
droop long before night.

The art table was the most attractive in the room. There was a
crowd about it all day long, and the tenders were constantly flying
to and fro with important faces and rattling money boxes. Amy often
looked wistfully across, longing to be there, where she felt at
home and happy, instead of in a corner with nothing to do. It might
seem no hardship to some of us, but to a pretty, blithe young girl,
it was not only tedious, but very trying, and the thought of Laurie
and his friends made it a real martyrdom.

She did not go home till night, and then she looked so pale and
quiet that they knew the day had been a hard one, though she made
no complaint, and did not even tell what she had done. Her mother
gave her an extra cordial cup of tea. Beth helped her dress, and
made a charming little wreath for her hair, while Jo astonished her
family by getting herself up with unusual care, and hinting darkly
that the tables were about to be turned.

"Don't do anything rude, pray Jo; I won't have any fuss made, so
let it all pass and behave yourself," begged Amy, as she departed
early, hoping to find a reinforcement of flowers to refresh her
poor little table.

"I merely intend to make myself entrancingly agreeable to every
one I know, and to keep them in your corner as long as possible.
Teddy and his boys will lend a hand, and we'll have a good time
yet." returned Jo, leaning over the gate to watch for Laurie.
Presently the familiar tramp was heard in the dusk, and she ran out
to meet him.

"Is that my boy?"

"As sure as this is my girl!" and Laurie tucked her hand under
his arm with the air of a man whose every wish was gratified.

"Oh, Teddy, such doings!" and Jo told Amy's wrongs with sisterly
zeal.

"A flock of our fellows are going to drive over by-and-by, and
I'll be hanged if I don't make them buy every flower she's got, and
camp down before her table afterward," said Laurie, espousing her
cause with warmth.

"The flowers are not at all nice, Amy says, and the fresh ones
may not arrive in time. I don't wish to be unjust or suspicious,
but I shouldn't wonder if they never came at all. When people do
one mean thing they are very likely to do another," observed Jo in
a disgusted tone.
