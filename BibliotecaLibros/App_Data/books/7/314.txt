Jo’s Journal



New York, November

Dear Marmee and Beth,

I'm going to write you a regular volume, for I've
got heaps to tell, though I'm not a fine young lady traveling on
the continent. When I lost sight of Father's dear old face, I felt
a trifle blue, and might have shed a briny drop or two, if an Irish
lady with four small children, all crying more or less, hadn't
diverted my mind, for I amused myself by dropping gingerbread nuts
over the seat every time they opened their mouths to roar.

Soon the sun came out, and taking it as a good
omen, I cleared up likewise and enjoyed my journey with all my
heart.

Mrs. Kirke welcomed me so kindly I felt at home
at once, even in that big house full of strangers. She gave me a
funny little sky parlor—all she had, but there is a stove in it,
and a nice table in a sunny window, so I can sit here and write
whenever I like. A fine view and a church tower opposite atone for
the many stairs, and I took a fancy to my den on the spot. The
nursery, where I am to teach and sew, is a pleasant room next Mrs.
Kirke's private parlor, and the two little girls are pretty
children, rather spoiled, I fancy, but they took to me after
telling them The Seven Bad Pigs, and I've no doubt I shall make a
model governess.

I am to have my meals with the children, if I
prefer it to the great table, and for the present I do, for I am
bashful, though no one will believe it.
