<br/>"Daisy March—father a colonel in the army—one of our first<br/>families, but reverses of fortune, you know; intimate friends of<br/>the Laurences; sweet creature, I assure you; my Ned is quite wild<br/>about her."<br/><br/>"Dear me!" said the old lady, putting up her glass for another<br/>observation of Meg, who tried to look as if she had not heard and<br/>been rather shocked at Mrs. Moffat's fibs. The 'queer feeling' did<br/>not pass away, but she imagined herself acting the new part of fine<br/>lady and so got on pretty well, though the tight dress gave her a<br/>side-ache, the train kept getting under her feet, and she was in<br/>constant fear lest her earrings should fly off and get lost or<br/>broken. She was flirting her fan and laughing at the feeble jokes<br/>of a young gentleman who tried to be witty, when she suddenly<br/>stopped laughing and looked confused, for just opposite, she saw<br/>Laurie. He was staring at her with undisguised surprise, and<br/>disapproval also, she thought, for though he bowed and smiled, yet<br/>something in his honest eyes made her blush and wish she had her<br/>old dress on. To complete her confusion, she saw Belle nudge Annie,<br/>and both glance from her to Laurie, who, she was happy to see,<br/>looked unusually boyish and shy.<br/><br/>"Silly creatures, to put such thoughts into my head. I won't<br/>care for it, or let it change me a bit," thought Meg, and rustled<br/>across the room to shake hands with her friend.<br/><br/>"I'm glad you came, I was afraid you wouldn't." she said, with<br/>her most grown-up air.<br/><br/>"Jo wanted me to come, and tell her how you looked, so I did,"<br/>answered Laurie, without turning his eyes upon her, though he half<br/>smiled at her maternal tone.<br/><br/>"What shall you tell her?" asked Meg, full of curiosity to know<br/>his opinion of her, yet feeling ill at ease with him for the first<br/>time.<br/><br/>"I shall say I didn't know you, for you look so grown-up and<br/>unlike yourself, I'm quite afraid of you," he said, fumbling at his<br/>glove button.<br/><br/>"How absurd of you! The girls dressed me up for fun, and I<br/>rather like it. Wouldn't Jo stare if she saw me?" said Meg, bent on<br/>making him say whether he thought her improved or not.<br/><br/>"Yes, I think she would," returned Laurie gravely.<br/><br/>"Don't you like me so?" asked Meg.<br/><br/>
