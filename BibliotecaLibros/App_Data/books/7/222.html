<br/>Here's fruit to feed our busy bee,<br/>And flowers for her nose.<br/>Here's music for her pianee,<br/>An afghan for her toes,<br/><br/>A portrait of Joanna, see,<br/>By Raphael No. 2,<br/>Who laboured with great industry<br/>To make it fair and true.<br/><br/>Accept a ribbon red, I beg,<br/>For Madam Purrer's tail,<br/>And ice cream made by lovely Peg,<br/>A Mont Blanc in a pail.<br/><br/>Their dearest love my makers laid<br/>Within my breast of snow.<br/>Accept it, and the Alpine maid,<br/>From Laurie and from Jo.<br/><br/>
