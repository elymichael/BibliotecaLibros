"Don't peck at one another, children. Don't you wish we had the
money Papa lost when we were little, Jo? Dear me! How happy and
good we'd be, if we had no worries!" said Meg, who could remember
better times.

"You said the other day you thought we were a deal happier than
the King children, for they were fighting and fretting all the
time, in spite of their money."

"So I did, Beth. Well, I think we are. For though we do have to
work, we make fun of ourselves, and are a pretty jolly set, as Jo
would say."

"Jo does use such slang words!" observed Amy, with a reproving
look at the long figure stretched on the rug.

Jo immediately sat up, put her hands in her pockets, and began
to whistle.

"Don't, Jo. It's so boyish!"

"That's why I do it."

"I detest rude, unladylike girls!"

"I hate affected, niminy-piminy chits!"

"Birds in their little nests agree," sang Beth, the peacemaker,
with such a funny face that both sharp voices softened to a laugh,
and the "pecking" ended for that time.

"Really, girls, you are both to be blamed," said Meg, beginning
to lecture in her elder-sisterly fashion. "You are old enough to
leave off boyish tricks, and to behave better, Josephine. It didn't
matter so much when you were a little girl, but now you are so
tall, and turn up your hair, you should remember that you are a
young lady."
