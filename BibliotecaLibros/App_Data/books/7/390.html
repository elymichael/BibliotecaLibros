<br/>"You thoughtful creeter, you're determined we shan't miss that<br/>dear lamb ef you can help it. We don't say much, but we see it, and<br/>the Lord will bless you for't, see ef He don't."<br/><br/>As they sat sewing together, Jo discovered how much improved her<br/>sister Meg was, how well she could talk, how much she knew about<br/>good, womanly impulses, thoughts, and feelings, how happy she was<br/>in husband and children, and how much they were all doing for each<br/>other.<br/><br/>"Marriage is an excellent thing, after all. I wonder if I should<br/>blossom out half as well as you have, if I tried it?,<br/>always&#160;<br/>'perwisin'<br/>&#160;I could," said Jo, as she<br/>constructed a kite for Demi in the topsy-turvy nursery.<br/><br/>"It's just what you need to bring out the tender womanly half of<br/>your nature, Jo. You are like a chestnut burr, prickly outside, but<br/>silky-soft within, and a sweet kernal, if one can only get at it.<br/>Love will make you show your heart one day, and then the rough burr<br/>will fall off."<br/><br/>"Frost opens chestnut burrs, ma'am, and it takes a good shake to<br/>bring them down. Boys go nutting, and I don't care to be bagged by<br/>them," returned Jo, pasting away at the kite which no wind that<br/>blows would ever carry up, for Daisy had tied herself on as a<br/>bob.<br/><br/>Meg laughed, for she was glad to see a glimmer of Jo's old<br/>spirit, but she felt it her duty to enforce her opinion by every<br/>argument in her power, and the sisterly chats were not wasted,<br/>especially as two of Meg's most effective arguments were the<br/>babies, whom Jo loved tenderly. Grief is the best opener of some<br/>hearts, and Jo's was nearly ready for the bag. A little more<br/>sunshine to ripen the nut, then, not a boy's impatient shake, but a<br/>man's hand reached up to pick it gently from the burr, and find the<br/>kernal sound and sweet. If she suspected this, she would have shut<br/>up tight, and been more prickly than ever, fortunately she wasn't<br/>thinking about herself, so when the time came, down she<br/>dropped.<br/><br/>Now, if she had been the heroine of a moral storybook, she ought<br/>at this period of her life to have become quite saintly, renounced<br/>the world, and gone about doing good in a mortified bonnet, with<br/>tracts in her pocket. But, you see, Jo wasn't a heroine, she was<br/>only a struggling human girl like hundreds of others, and she just<br/>acted out her nature, being sad, cross, listless, or energetic, as<br/>the mood suggested. It's highly virtuous to say we'll be good, but<br/>we can't do it all at once, and it takes a long pull, a strong<br/>pull, and a pull all together before some of us even get our feet<br/>set in the right way. Jo had got so far, she was learning to do her<br/>duty, and to feel unhappy if she did not, but to do it cheerfully,<br/>ah, that was another thing! She had often said she wanted to do<br/>something splendid, no matter how hard, and now she had her wish,<br/>for what could be more beautiful than to devote her life to Father<br/>and Mother, trying to make home as happy to them as they had to<br/>her? And if difficulties were necessary to increase the splendor of<br/>the effort, what could be harder for a restless, ambitious girl<br/>than to give up her own hopes, plans, and desires, and cheerfully<br/>live for others?<br/><br/>Providence had taken her at her word. Here was the task, not<br/>what she had expected, but better because self had no part in it.<br/>Now, could she do it? She decided that she would try, and in her<br/>first attempt she found the helps I have suggested. Still another<br/>was given her, and she took it, not as a reward, but as a comfort,<br/>as Christian took the refreshment afforded by the little arbor<br/>where he rested, as he climbed the hill called Difficulty.<br/><br/>"Why don't you write? That always used to make you happy," said<br/>her mother once, when the desponding fit over-shadowed Jo.<br/><br/>
