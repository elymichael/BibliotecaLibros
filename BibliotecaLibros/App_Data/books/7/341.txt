Bethâ€™s Secret


When Jo came home that spring, she had been struck with the
change in Beth. No one spoke of it or seemed aware of it, for it
had come too gradually to startle those who saw her daily, but to
eyes sharpened by absence, it was very plain and a heavy weight
fell on Jo's heart as she saw her sister's face. It was no paler
and but littler thinner than in the autumn, yet there was a
strange, transparent look about it, as if the mortal was being
slowly refined away, and the immortal shining through the frail
flesh with an indescribably pathetic beauty. Jo saw and felt it,
but said nothing at the time, and soon the first impression lost
much of its power, for Beth seemed happy, no one appeared to doubt
that she was better, and presently in other cares Jo for a time
forgot her fear.

But when Laurie was gone, and peace prevailed again, the vague
anxiety returned and haunted her. She had confessed her sins and
been forgiven, but when she showed her savings and proposed a
mountain trip, Beth had thanked her heartily, but begged not to go
so far away from home. Another little visit to the seashore would
suit her better, and as Grandma could not be prevailed upon to
leave the babies, Jo took Beth down to the quiet place, where she
could live much in the open air, and let the fresh sea breezes blow
a little color into her pale cheeks.

It was not a fashionable place, but even among the pleasant
people there, the girls made few friends, preferring to live for
one another. Beth was too shy to enjoy society, and Jo too wrapped
up in her to care for anyone else. So they were all in all to each
other, and came and went, quite unconscious of the interest they
exited in those about them, who watched with sympathetic eyes the
strong sister and the feeble one, always together, as if they felt
instinctively that a long separation was not far away.

They did feel it, yet neither spoke of it, for often between
ourselves and those nearest and dearest to us there exists a
reserve which it is very hard to overcome. Jo felt as if a veil had
fallen between her heart and Beth's, but when she put out her hand
to lift it up, there seemed something sacred in the silence, and
she waited for Beth to speak. She wondered, and was thankful also,
that her parents did not seem to see what she saw, and during the
quiet weeks when the shadows grew so plain to her, she said nothing
of it to those at home, believing that it would tell itself when
Beth came back no better. She wondered still more if her sister
really guessed the hard truth, and what thoughts were passing
through her mind during the long hours when she lay on the warm
rocks with her head in Jo's lap, while the winds blew healthfully
over her and the sea made music at her feet.

One day Beth told her. Jo thought she was asleep, she lay so
still, and putting down her book, sat looking at her with wistful
eyes, trying to see signs of hope in the faint color on Beth's
cheeks. But she could not find enough to satisfy her, for the
cheeks were very thin, and the hands seemed too feeble to hold even
the rosy little shells they had been collecting. It came to her
then more bitterly than ever that Beth was slowly drifting away
from her, and her arms instinctively tightened their hold upon the
dearest treasure she possessed. For a minute her eyes were too dim
for seeing, and when they cleared, Beth was looking up at her so
tenderly that there was hardly any need for her to say, "Jo, dear,
I'm glad you know it. I've tried to tell you, but I couldn't."

There was no answer except her sister's cheek against her own,
not even tears, for when most deeply moved, Jo did not cry. She was
the weaker then, and Beth tried to comfort and sustain her, with
her arms about her and the soothing words she whispered in her
ear.

"I've known it for a good while, dear, and now I'm used to it,
it isn't hard to think of or to bear. Try to see it so and don't be
troubled about me, because it's best, indeed it is."
