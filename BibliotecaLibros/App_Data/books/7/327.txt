She said nothing at first, for she liked to hear him laugh out
his big, hearty laugh when anything funny happened, so she left him
to discover it for himself, and presently forgot all about it, for
to hear a German read Schiller is rather an absorbing occupation.
After the reading came the lesson, which was a lively one, for Jo
was in a gay mood that night, and the cocked hat kept her eyes
dancing with merriment. The Professor didn't know what to make of
her, and stopped at last to ask with an air of mild surprise that
was irresistible…

"Mees Marsch, for what do you laugh in your master's face? Haf
you no respect for me, that you go on so bad?"

"How can I be respectful, Sir, when you forget to take your hat
off?" said Jo.

Lifting his hand to his head, the absent-minded Professor
gravely felt and removed the little cocked hat, looked at it a
minute, and then threw back his head and laughed like a merry bass
viol.

"Ah! I see him now, it is that imp Tina who makes me a fool with
my cap. Well, it is nothing, but see you, if this lesson goes not
well, you too shall wear him."

But the lesson did not go at all for a few minutes because Mr.
Bhaer caught sight of a picture on the hat, and unfolding it, said
with great disgust, "I wish these papers did not come in the house.
They are not for children to see, nor young people to read. It is
not well, and I haf no patience with those who make this harm."

Jo glanced at the sheet and saw a pleasing illustration composed
of a lunatic, a corpse, a villain, and a viper. She did not like
it, but the impulse that made her turn it over was not one of
displeasure but fear, because for a minute she fancied the paper
was the Volcano. It was not, however, and her panic subsided as she
remembered that even if it had been and one of her own tales in it,
there would have been no name to betray her. She had betrayed
herself, however, by a look and a blush, for though an absent man,
the Professor saw a good deal more than people fancied. He knew
that Jo wrote, and had met her down among the newspaper offices
more than once, but as she never spoke of it, he asked no questions
in spite of a strong desire to see her work. Now it occurred to him
that she was doing what she was ashamed to own, and it troubled
him. He did not say to himself, "It is none of my business. I've no
right to say anything," as many people would have done. He only
remembered that she was young and poor, a girl far away from
mother's love and father's care, and he was moved to help her with
an impulse as quick and natural as that which would prompt him to
put out his hand to save a baby from a puddle. All this flashed
through his mind in a minute, but not a trace of it appeared in his
face, and by the time the paper was turned, and Jo's needle
threaded, he was ready to say quite naturally, but very
gravely…

"Yes, you are right to put it from you. I do not think that good
young girls should see such things. They are made pleasant to some,
but I would more rather give my boys gunpowder to play with than
this bad trash."

"All may not be bad, only silly, you know, and if there is a
demand for it, I don't see any harm in supplying it. Many very
respectable people make an honest living out of what are called
sensation stories," said Jo, scratching gathers so energetically
that a row of little slits followed her pin.

"There is a demand for whisky, but I think you and I do not care
to sell it. If the respectable people knew what harm they did, they
would not feel that the living was honest. They haf no right to put
poison in the sugarplum, and let the small ones eat it. No, they
should think a little, and sweep mud in the street before they do
this thing."
