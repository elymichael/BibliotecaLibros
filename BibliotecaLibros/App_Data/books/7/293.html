"Yes, we all do, and love her for being so ready to forgive. It<br/>must have been dreadfully hard, after working so long and setting<br/>your heart on selling your own pretty things. I don't believe I<br/>could have done it as kindly as you did," added Beth from her<br/>pillow.<br/><br/>"Why, girls, you needn't praise me so. I only did as I'd be done<br/>by. You laugh at me when I say I want to be a lady, but I mean a<br/>true gentlewoman in mind and manners, and I try to do it as far as<br/>I know how. I can't explain exactly, but I want to be above the<br/>little meannesses and follies and faults that spoil so many women.<br/>I'm far from it now, but I do my best, and hope in time to be what<br/>Mother is."<br/><br/>Amy spoke earnestly, and Jo said, with a cordial hug, "I<br/>understand now what you mean, and I'll never laugh at you again.<br/>You are getting on faster than you think, and I'll take lessons of<br/>you in true politeness, for you've learned the secret, I believe.<br/>Try away, deary, you'll get your reward some day, and no one will<br/>be more delighted than I shall."<br/><br/>A week later Amy did get her reward, and poor Jo found it hard<br/>to be delighted. A letter came from Aunt Carrol, and Mrs. March's<br/>face was illuminated to such a degree when she read it that Jo and<br/>Beth, who were with her, demanded what the glad tidings were.<br/><br/>"Aunt Carrol is going abroad next month, and wants… "<br/><br/>"Me to go with her!" burst in Jo, flying out of her chair in an<br/>uncontrollable rapture.<br/><br/>"No, dear, not you. It's Amy."<br/><br/>"Oh, Mother! She's too young, it's my turn first. I've wanted it<br/>so long. It would do me so much good, and be so altogether<br/>splendid. I must go!"<br/><br/>"I'm afraid it's impossible, Jo. Aunt says Amy, decidedly, and<br/>it is not for us to dictate when she offers such a favor."<br/><br/>"It's always so. Amy has all the fun and I have all the work. It<br/>isn't fair, oh, it isn't fair!" cried Jo passionately.<br/><br/>"I'm afraid it's partly your own fault, dear. When Aunt spoke to<br/>me the other day, she regretted your blunt manners and too<br/>independent spirit, and here she writes, as if quoting something<br/>you had said—'I planned at first to ask Jo, but as 'favors burden<br/>her', and she 'hates French', I think I won't venture to invite<br/>her. Amy is more docile, will make a good companion for Flo, and<br/>receive gratefully any help the trip may give her."<br/>
