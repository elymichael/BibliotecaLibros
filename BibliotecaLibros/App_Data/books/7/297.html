"Oh, have you e'er heard of Kate Kearney?<br/>She lives on the banks of Killarney;<br/>From the glance of her eye,<br/>Shun danger and fly,<br/>For fatal's the glance of Kate Kearney."<br/><br/>Wasn't that nonsensical?<br/><br/>We only stopped at Liverpool a few hours. It's a<br/>dirty, noisy place, and I was glad to leave it. Uncle rushed out<br/>and bought a pair of dogskin gloves, some ugly, thick shoes, and an<br/>umbrella, and got shaved&#160;<br/>à la<br/>&#160;mutton chop, the<br/>first thing. Then he flattered himself that he looked like a true<br/>Briton, but the first time he had the mud cleaned off his shoes,<br/>the little bootblack knew that an American stood in them, and said,<br/>with a grin, "There yer har, sir. I've given 'em the latest Yankee<br/>shine." It amused Uncle immensely. Oh, I must tell you what that<br/>absurd Lennox did! He got his friend Ward, who came on with us, to<br/>order a bouquet for me, and the first thing I saw in my room was a<br/>lovely one, with "Robert Lennox's compliments," on the card. Wasn't<br/>that fun, girls? I like traveling.<br/><br/>I never shall get to London if I don't hurry. The<br/>trip was like riding through a long picture gallery, full of lovely<br/>landscapes. The farmhouses were my delight, with thatched roofs,<br/>ivy up to the eaves, latticed windows, and stout women with rosy<br/>children at the doors. The very cattle looked more tranquil than<br/>ours, as they stood knee-deep in clover, and the hens had a<br/>contented cluck, as if they never got nervous like Yankee biddies.<br/>Such perfect color I never saw, the grass so green, sky so blue,<br/>grain so yellow, woods so dark, I was in a rapture all the way. So<br/>was Flo, and we kept bouncing from one side to the other, trying to<br/>see everything while we were whisking along at the rate of sixty<br/>miles an hour. Aunt was tired and went to sleep, but Uncle read his<br/>guidebook, and wouldn't be astonished at anything. This is the way<br/>we went on. Amy, flying up—"Oh, that must be Kenilworth, that gray<br/>place among the trees!" Flo, darting to my window—"How sweet! We<br/>must go there sometime, won't we Papa?" Uncle, calmly admiring his<br/>boots—"No, my dear, not unless you want beer, that's a<br/>brewery."<br/><br/>A pause—then Flo cried out, "Bless me, there's a<br/>gallows and a man going up." "Where, where?" shrieks Amy, staring<br/>out at two tall posts with a crossbeam and some dangling chains. "A<br/>colliery," remarks Uncle, with a twinkle of the eye. "Here's a<br/>lovely flock of lambs all lying down," says Amy. "See, Papa, aren't<br/>they pretty?" added Flo sentimentally. "Geese, young ladies,"<br/>returns Uncle, in a tone that keeps us quiet till Flo settles down<br/>to enjoy the&#160;<br/>Flirtations of Captain Cavendish<br/>, and I<br/>have the scenery all to myself.<br/><br/>Of course it rained when we got to London, and<br/>there was nothing to be seen but fog and umbrellas. We rested,<br/>unpacked, and shopped a little between the showers. Aunt Mary got<br/>me some new things, for I came off in such a hurry I wasn't half<br/>ready. A white hat and blue feather, a muslin dress to match, and<br/>the loveliest mantle you ever saw. Shopping in Regent Street is<br/>perfectly splendid. Things seem so cheap, nice ribbons only<br/>sixpence a yard. I laid in a stock, but shall get my gloves in<br/>Paris. Doesn't that sound sort of elegant and rich?<br/><br/>Flo and I, for the fun of it, ordered a hansom<br/>cab, while Aunt and Uncle were out, and went for a drive, though we<br/>learned afterward that it wasn't the thing for young ladies to ride<br/>in them alone. It was so droll! For when we were shut in by the<br/>wooden apron, the man drove so fast that Flo was frightened, and<br/>told me to stop him, but he was up outside behind somewhere, and I<br/>couldn't get at him. He didn't hear me call, nor see me flap my<br/>parasol in front, and there we were, quite helpless, rattling away,<br/>and whirling around corners at a breakneck pace. At last, in my<br/>despair, I saw a little door in the roof, and on poking it open, a<br/>red eye appeared, and a beery voice said…<br/>
