"You are not engaged, I hope?" and Laurie looked very
elder-brotherly and grave all of a sudden.

"No."

"But you will be, if he comes back and goes properly down on his
knees, won't you?"

"Very likely."

"Then you are fond of old Fred?"

"I could be, if I tried."

"But you don't intend to try till the proper moment? Bless my
soul, what unearthly prudence! He's a good fellow, Amy, but not the
man I fancied you'd like."

"He is rich, a gentleman, and has delightful manners," began
Amy, trying to be quite cool and dignified, but feeling a little
ashamed of herself, in spite of the sincerity of her
intentions.

"I understand. Queens of society can't get on without money, so
you mean to make a good match, and start in that way? Quite right
and proper, as the world goes, but it sounds odd from the lips of
one of your mother's girls."

"True, nevertheless."

A short speech, but the quiet decision with which it was uttered
contrasted curiously with the young speaker. Laurie felt this
instinctively and laid himself down again, with a sense of
disappointment which he could not explain. His look and silence, as
well as a certain inward self-disapproval, ruffled Amy, and made
her resolve to deliver her lecture without delay.
