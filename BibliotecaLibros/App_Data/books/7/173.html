<br/>Laurie and his grandfather came over to see her off, and Mr.<br/>Brooke looked so strong and sensible and kind that the girls<br/>christened him 'Mr. Greatheart' on the spot.<br/><br/>"Goodby, my darlings! God bless and keep us all!" whispered Mrs.<br/>March, as she kissed one dear little face after the other, and<br/>hurried into the carriage.<br/><br/>As she rolled away, the sun came out, and looking back, she saw<br/>it shining on the group at the gate like a good omen. They saw it<br/>also, and smiled and waved their hands, and the last thing she<br/>beheld as she turned the corner was the four bright faces, and<br/>behind them like a bodyguard, old Mr. Laurence, faithful Hannah,<br/>and devoted Laurie.<br/><br/>"How kind everyone is to us!" she said, turning to find fresh<br/>proof of it in the respectful sympathy of the young man's face.<br/><br/>"I don't see how they can help it," returned Mr. Brooke,<br/>laughing so infectiously that Mrs. March could not help smiling.<br/>And so the journey began with the good omens of sunshine, smiles,<br/>and cheerful words.<br/><br/>"I feel as if there had been an earthquake," said Jo, as their<br/>neighbors went home to breakfast, leaving them to rest and refresh<br/>themselves.<br/><br/>"It seems as if half the house was gone," added Meg<br/>forlornly.<br/><br/>Beth opened her lips to say something, but could only point to<br/>the pile of nicely mended hose which lay on Mother's table, showing<br/>that even in her last hurried moments she had thought and worked<br/>for them. It was a little thing, but it went straight to their<br/>hearts, and in spite of their brave resolutions, they all broke<br/>down and cried bitterly.<br/><br/>Hannah wisely allowed them to relieve their feelings, and when<br/>the shower showed signs of clearing up, she came to the rescue,<br/>armed with a coffeepot.<br/><br/>"Now, my dear young ladies, remember what your ma said, and<br/>don't fret. Come and have a cup of coffee all round, and then let's<br/>fall to work and be a credit to the family."<br/><br/>
