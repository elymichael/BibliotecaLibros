<br/>Feeling almost happy again, she laid by a few ferns and roses<br/>for herself, and quickly made up the rest in dainty bouquets for<br/>the breasts, hair, or skirts of her friends, offering them so<br/>prettily that Clara, the elder sister, told her she was 'the<br/>sweetest little thing she ever saw', and they looked quite charmed<br/>with her small attention. Somehow the kind act finished her<br/>despondency, and when all the rest went to show themselves to Mrs.<br/>Moffat, she saw a happy, bright-eyed face in the mirror, as she<br/>laid her ferns against her rippling hair and fastened the roses in<br/>the dress that didn't strike her as so very shabby now.<br/><br/>She enjoyed herself very much that evening, for she danced to<br/>her heart's content. Everyone was very kind, and she had three<br/>compliments. Annie made her sing, and some one said she had a<br/>remarkably fine voice. Major Lincoln asked who 'the fresh little<br/>girl with the beautiful eyes' was, and Mr. Moffat insisted on<br/>dancing with her because she 'didn't dawdle, but had some spring in<br/>her', as he gracefully expressed it. So altogether she had a very<br/>nice time, till she overheard a bit of conversation, which<br/>disturbed her extremely. She was sitting just inside the<br/>conservatory, waiting for her partner to bring her an ice, when she<br/>heard a voice ask on the other side of the flowery wall…<br/><br/>"How old is he?"<br/><br/>"Sixteen or seventeen, I should say," replied another voice.<br/><br/>"It would be a grand thing for one of those girls, wouldn't it?<br/>Sallie says they are very intimate now, and the old man quite dotes<br/>on them."<br/><br/>"Mrs. M. has made her plans, I dare say, and will play her cards<br/>well, early as it is. The girl evidently doesn't think of it yet,"<br/>said Mrs. Moffat.<br/><br/>"She told that fib about her momma, as if she did know, and<br/>colored up when the flowers came quite prettily. Poor thing! She'd<br/>be so nice if she was only got up in style. Do you think she'd be<br/>offended if we offered to lend her a dress for Thursday?" asked<br/>another voice.<br/><br/>"She's proud, but I don't believe she'd mind, for that dowdy<br/>tarlaton is all she has got. She may tear it tonight, and that will<br/>be a good excuse for offering a decent one."<br/><br/>Here Meg's partner appeared, to find her looking much flushed<br/>and rather agitated. She was proud, and her pride was useful just<br/>then, for it helped her hide her mortification, anger, and disgust<br/>at what she had just heard. For, innocent and unsuspicious as she<br/>was, she could not help understanding the gossip of her friends.<br/>She tried to forget it, but could not, and kept repeating to<br/>herself, "Mrs. M. has made her plans," "that fib about her mamma,"<br/>and "dowdy tarlaton," till she was ready to cry and rush home to<br/>tell her troubles and ask for advice. As that was impossible, she<br/>did her best to seem gay, and being rather excited, she succeeded<br/>so well that no one dreamed what an effort she was making. She was<br/>very glad when it was all over and she was quiet in her bed, where<br/>she could think and wonder and fume till her head ached and her hot<br/>cheeks were cooled by a few natural tears. Those foolish, yet well<br/>meant words, had opened a new world to Meg, and much disturbed the<br/>peace of the old one in which till now she had lived as happily as<br/>a child. Her innocent friendship with Laurie was spoiled by the<br/>silly speeches she had overheard. Her faith in her mother was a<br/>little shaken by the worldly plans attributed to her by Mrs.<br/>Moffat, who judged others by herself, and the sensible resolution<br/>to be contented with the simple wardrobe which suited a poor man's<br/>daughter was weakened by the unnecessary pity of girls who thought<br/>a shabby dress one of the greatest calamities under heaven.<br/><br/>Poor Meg had a restless night, and got up heavy-eyed, unhappy,<br/>half resentful toward her friends, and half ashamed of herself for<br/>not speaking out frankly and setting everything right. Everybody<br/>dawdled that morning, and it was noon before the girls found energy<br/>enough even to take up their worsted work. Something in the manner<br/>of her friends struck Meg at once. They treated her with more<br/>respect, she thought, took quite a tender interest in what she<br/>said, and looked at her with eyes that plainly betrayed curiosity.<br/>All this surprised and flattered her, though she did not understand<br/>it till Miss Belle looked up from her writing, and said, with a<br/>sentimental air…<br/><br/>
