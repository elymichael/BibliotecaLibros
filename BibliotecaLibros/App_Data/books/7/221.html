<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>22<br/>Pleasant Meadows<br/><br/><br/>Like sunshine after a storm were the peaceful weeks which<br/>followed. The invalids improved rapidly, and Mr. March began to<br/>talk of returning early in the new year. Beth was soon able to lie<br/>on the study sofa all day, amusing herself with the well-beloved<br/>cats at first, and in time with doll's sewing, which had fallen<br/>sadly behind-hand. Her once active limbs were so stiff and feeble<br/>that Jo took her for a daily airing about the house in her strong<br/>arms. Meg cheerfully blackened and burned her white hands cooking<br/>delicate messes for 'the dear', while Amy, a loyal slave of the<br/>ring, celebrated her return by giving away as many of her treasures<br/>as she could prevail on her sisters to accept.<br/><br/>As Christmas approached, the usual mysteries began to haunt the<br/>house, and Jo frequently convulsed the family by proposing utterly<br/>impossible or magnificently absurd ceremonies, in honor of this<br/>unusually merry Christmas. Laurie was equally impracticable, and<br/>would have had bonfires, skyrockets, and triumphal arches, if he<br/>had had his own way. After many skirmishes and snubbings, the<br/>ambitious pair were considered effectually quenched and went about<br/>with forlorn faces, which were rather belied by explosions of<br/>laughter when the two got together.<br/><br/>Several days of unusually mild weather fitly ushered in a<br/>splendid Christmas Day. Hannah 'felt in her bones' that it was<br/>going to be an unusually fine day, and she proved herself a true<br/>prophetess, for everybody and everything seemed bound to produce a<br/>grand success. To begin with, Mr. March wrote that he should soon<br/>be with them, then Beth felt uncommonly well that morning, and,<br/>being dressed in her mother's gift, a soft crimson merino wrapper,<br/>was borne in high triumph to the window to behold the offering of<br/>Jo and Laurie. The Unquenchables had done their best to be worthy<br/>of the name, for like elves they had worked by night and conjured<br/>up a comical surprise. Out in the garden stood a stately snow<br/>maiden, crowned with holly, bearing a basket of fruit and flowers<br/>in one hand, a great roll of music in the other, a perfect rainbow<br/>of an Afghan round her chilly shoulders, and a Christmas carol<br/>issuing from her lips on a pink paper streamer.<br/><br/><br/>THE JUNGFRAU TO BETH<br/><br/>God bless you, dear Queen Bess!<br/>May nothing you dismay,<br/>But health and peace and happiness<br/>Be yours, this Christmas day.<br/>
