<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>14<br/>New Impressions<br/><br/><br/>At three o'clock in the afternoon, all the fashionable world at<br/>Nice may be seen on the Promenade des Anglais—a charming place, for<br/>the wide walk, bordered with palms, flowers, and tropical shrubs,<br/>is bounded on one side by the sea, on the other by the grand drive,<br/>lined with hotels and villas, while beyond lie orange orchards and<br/>the hills. Many nations are represented, many languages spoken,<br/>many costumes worn, and on a sunny day the spectacle is as gay and<br/>brilliant as a carnival. Haughty English, lively French, sober<br/>Germans, handsome Spaniards, ugly Russians, meek Jews,<br/>free-and-easy Americans, all drive, sit, or saunter here, chatting<br/>over the news, and criticizing the latest celebrity who has<br/>arrived—Ristori or Dickens, Victor Emmanuel or the Queen of the<br/>Sandwich Islands. The equipages are as varied as the company and<br/>attract as much attention, especially the low basket barouches in<br/>which ladies drive themselves, with a pair of dashing ponies, gay<br/>nets to keep their voluminous flounces from overflowing the<br/>diminutive vehicles, and little grooms on the perch behind.<br/><br/>Along this walk, on Christmas Day, a tall young man walked<br/>slowly, with his hands behind him, and a somewhat absent expression<br/>of countenance. He looked like an Italian, was dressed like an<br/>Englishman, and had the independent air of an American—a<br/>combination which caused sundry pairs of feminine eyes to look<br/>approvingly after him, and sundry dandies in black velvet suits,<br/>with rose-colored neckties, buff gloves, and orange flowers in<br/>their buttonholes, to shrug their shoulders, and then envy him his<br/>inches. There were plenty of pretty faces to admire, but the young<br/>man took little notice of them, except to glance now and then at<br/>some blonde girl in blue. Presently he strolled out of the<br/>promenade and stood a moment at the crossing, as if undecided<br/>whether to go and listen to the band in the Jardin Publique, or to<br/>wander along the beach toward Castle Hill. The quick trot of<br/>ponies' feet made him look up, as one of the little carriages,<br/>containing a single young lady, came rapidly down the street. The<br/>lady was young, blonde, and dressed in blue. He stared a minute,<br/>then his whole face woke up, and, waving his hat like a boy, he<br/>hurried forward to meet her.<br/><br/>"Oh, Laurie, is it really you? I thought you'd never come!"<br/>cried Amy, dropping the reins and holding out both hands, to the<br/>great scandalization of a French mamma, who hastened her daughter's<br/>steps, lest she should be demoralized by beholding the free manners<br/>of these 'mad English'.<br/><br/>"I was detained by the way, but I promised to spend Christmas<br/>with you, and here I am."<br/><br/>"How is your grandfather? When did you come? Where are you<br/>staying?"<br/><br/>"Very well—last night—at the Chauvain. I called at your hotel,<br/>but you were out."<br/><br/>"I have so much to say, I don't know where to begin! Get in and<br/>we can talk at our ease. I was going for a drive and longing for<br/>company. Flo's saving up for tonight."<br/>
