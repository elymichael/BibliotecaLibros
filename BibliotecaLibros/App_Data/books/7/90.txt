"Not a bit of it, I'm dying to do it. Come, I'll be good. I
don't like your gown, but I do think you are just splendid." And he
waved his hands, as if words failed to express his admiration.

Meg smiled and relented, and whispered as they stood waiting to
catch the time, "Take care my skirt doesn't trip you up. It's the
plague of my life and I was a goose to wear it."

"Pin it round your neck, and then it will be useful," said
Laurie, looking down at the little blue boots, which he evidently
approved of.

Away they went fleetly and gracefully, for having practiced at
home, they were well matched, and the blithe young couple were a
pleasant sight to see, as they twirled merrily round and round,
feeling more friendly than ever after their small tiff.

"Laurie, I want you to do me a favor, will you?" said Meg, as he
stood fanning her when her breath gave out, which it did very soon
though she would not own why.

"Won't I!" said Laurie, with alacrity.

"Please don't tell them at home about my dress tonight. They
won't understand the joke, and it will worry Mother."

"Then why did you do it?" said Laurie's eyes, so plainly that
Meg hastily addedâ€¦

"I shall tell them myself all about it, and 'fess' to Mother how
silly I've been. But I'd rather do it myself. So you'll not tell,
will you?"

"I give you my word I won't, only what shall I say when they ask
me?"
