"I only said I thought so."<br/><br/>"But you like me in spite of it?"<br/><br/>"Yes, I do, sir."<br/><br/>That answer pleased the old gentleman. He gave a short laugh,<br/>shook hands with her, and, putting his finger under her chin,<br/>turned up her face, examined it gravely, and let it go, saying with<br/>a nod, "You've got your grandfather's spirit, if you haven't his<br/>face. He was a fine man, my dear, but what is better, he was a<br/>brave and an honest one, and I was proud to be his friend."<br/><br/>"Thank you, sir," And Jo was quite comfortable after that, for<br/>it suited her exactly.<br/><br/>"What have you been doing to this boy of mine, hey?" was the<br/>next question, sharply put.<br/><br/>"Only trying to be neighborly, sir." And Jo told how her visit<br/>came about.<br/><br/>"You think he needs cheering up a bit, do you?"<br/><br/>"Yes, sir, he seems a little lonely, and young folks would do<br/>him good perhaps. We are only girls, but we should be glad to help<br/>if we could, for we don't forget the splendid Christmas present you<br/>sent us," said Jo eagerly.<br/><br/>"Tut, tut, tut! That was the boy's affair. How is the poor<br/>woman?"<br/><br/>"Doing nicely, sir." And off went Jo, talking very fast, as she<br/>told all about the Hummels, in whom her mother had interested<br/>richer friends than they were.<br/>
