"It shall be stopped, your tide must not turn so soon, nineteen<br/>is too young, Beth. I can't let you go. I'll work and pray and<br/>fight against it. I'll keep you in spite of everything. There must<br/>be ways, it can't be too late. God won't be so cruel as to take you<br/>from me," cried poor Jo rebelliously, for her spirit was far less<br/>piously submissive than Beth's.<br/><br/>Simple, sincere people seldom speak much of their piety. It<br/>shows itself in acts rather than in words, and has more influence<br/>than homilies or protestations. Beth could not reason upon or<br/>explain the faith that gave her courage and patience to give up<br/>life, and cheerfully wait for death. Like a confiding child, she<br/>asked no questions, but left everything to God and nature, Father<br/>and Mother of us all, feeling sure that they, and they only, could<br/>teach and strengthen heart and spirit for this life and the life to<br/>come. She did not rebuke Jo with saintly speeches, only loved her<br/>better for her passionate affection, and clung more closely to the<br/>dear human love, from which our Father never means us to be weaned,<br/>but through which He draws us closer to Himself. She could not say,<br/>"I'm glad to go," for life was very sweet for her. She could only<br/>sob out, "I try to be willing," while she held fast to Jo, as the<br/>first bitter wave of this great sorrow broke over them<br/>together.<br/><br/>By and by Beth said, with recovered serenity, "You'll tell them<br/>this when we go home?"<br/><br/>"I think they will see it without words," sighed Jo, for now it<br/>seemed to her that Beth changed every day.<br/><br/>"Perhaps not. I've heard that the people who love best are often<br/>blindest to such things. If they don't see it, you will tell them<br/>for me. I don't want any secrets, and it's kinder to prepare them.<br/>Meg has John and the babies to comfort her, but you must stand by<br/>Father and Mother, won't you Jo?"<br/><br/>"If I can. But, Beth, I don't give up yet. I'm going to believe<br/>that it is a sick fancy, and not let you think it's true." said Jo,<br/>trying to speak cheerfully.<br/><br/>Beth lay a minute thinking, and then said in her quiet way, "I<br/>don't know how to express myself, and shouldn't try to anyone but<br/>you, because I can't speak out except to my Jo. I only mean to say<br/>that I have a feeling that it never was intended I should live<br/>long. I'm not like the rest of you. I never made any plans about<br/>what I'd do when I grew up. I never thought of being married, as<br/>you all did. I couldn't seem to imagine myself anything but stupid<br/>little Beth, trotting about at home, of no use anywhere but there.<br/>I never wanted to go away, and the hard part now is the leaving you<br/>all. I'm not afraid, but it seems as if I should be homesick for<br/>you even in heaven."<br/><br/>Jo could not speak, and for several minutes there was no sound<br/>but the sigh of the wind and the lapping of the tide. A<br/>white-winged gull flew by, with the flash of sunshine on its<br/>silvery breast. Beth watched it till it vanished, and her eyes were<br/>full of sadness. A little gray-coated sand bird came tripping over<br/>the beach 'peeping' softly to itself, as if enjoying the sun and<br/>sea. It came quite close to Beth, and looked at her with a friendly<br/>eye and sat upon a warm stone, dressing its wet feathers, quite at<br/>home. Beth smiled and felt comforted, for the tiny thing seemed to<br/>offer its small friendship and remind her that a pleasant world was<br/>still to be enjoyed.<br/><br/>"Dear little bird! See, Jo, how tame it is. I like peeps better<br/>than the gulls. They are not so wild and handsome, but they seem<br/>happy, confiding little things. I used to call them my birds last<br/>summer, and Mother said they reminded her of meâ€”busy,<br/>quaker-colored creatures, always near the shore, and always<br/>chirping that contented little song of theirs. You are the gull,<br/>Jo, strong and wild, fond of the storm and the wind, flying far out<br/>to sea, and happy all alone. Meg is the turtledove, and Amy is like<br/>the lark she writes about, trying to get up among the clouds, but<br/>always dropping down into its nest again. Dear little girl! She's<br/>so ambitious, but her heart is good and tender, and no matter how<br/>high she flies, she never will forget home. I hope I shall see her<br/>again, but she seems so far away."<br/><br/>"She is coming in the spring, and I mean that you shall be all<br/>ready to see and enjoy her. I'm going to have you well and rosy by<br/>that time," began Jo, feeling that of all the changes in Beth, the<br/>talking change was the greatest, for it seemed to cost no effort<br/>now, and she thought aloud in a way quite unlike bashful Beth.<br/><br/>"Jo, dear, don't hope any more. It won't do any good. I'm sure<br/>of that. We won't be miserable, but enjoy being together while we<br/>wait. We'll have happy times, for I don't suffer much, and I think<br/>the tide will go out easily, if you help me."<br/>
