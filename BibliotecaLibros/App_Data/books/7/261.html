<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>4<br/>Literary Lessons<br/><br/><br/>Fortune suddenly smiled upon Jo, and dropped a good luck penny<br/>in her path. Not a golden penny, exactly, but I doubt if half a<br/>million would have given more real happiness then did the little<br/>sum that came to her in this wise.<br/><br/>Every few weeks she would shut herself up in her room, put on<br/>her scribbling suit, and 'fall into a vortex', as she expressed it,<br/>writing away at her novel with all her heart and soul, for till<br/>that was finished she could find no peace. Her 'scribbling suit'<br/>consisted of a black woolen pinafore on which she could wipe her<br/>pen at will, and a cap of the same material, adorned with a<br/>cheerful red bow, into which she bundled her hair when the decks<br/>were cleared for action. This cap was a beacon to the inquiring<br/>eyes of her family, who during these periods kept their distance,<br/>merely popping in their heads semi-occasionally to ask, with<br/>interest, "Does genius burn, Jo?" They did not always venture even<br/>to ask this question, but took an observation of the cap, and<br/>judged accordingly. If this expressive article of dress was drawn<br/>low upon the forehead, it was a sign that hard work was going on,<br/>in exciting moments it was pushed rakishly askew, and when despair<br/>seized the author it was plucked wholly off, and cast upon the<br/>floor. At such times the intruder silently withdrew, and not until<br/>the red bow was seen gaily erect upon the gifted brow, did anyone<br/>dare address Jo.<br/><br/>She did not think herself a genius by any means, but when the<br/>writing fit came on, she gave herself up to it with entire abandon,<br/>and led a blissful life, unconscious of want, care, or bad weather,<br/>while she sat safe and happy in an imaginary world, full of friends<br/>almost as real and dear to her as any in the flesh. Sleep forsook<br/>her eyes, meals stood untasted, day and night were all too short to<br/>enjoy the happiness which blessed her only at such times, and made<br/>these hours worth living, even if they bore no other fruit. The<br/>devine afflatus usually lasted a week or two, and then she emerged<br/>from her 'vortex', hungry, sleepy, cross, or despondent.<br/><br/>She was just recovering from one of these attacks when she was<br/>prevailed upon to escort Miss Crocker to a lecture, and in return<br/>for her virtue was rewarded with a new idea. It was a People's<br/>Course, the lecture on the Pyramids, and Jo rather wondered at the<br/>choice of such a subject for such an audience, but took it for<br/>granted that some great social evil would be remedied or some great<br/>want supplied by unfolding the glories of the Pharaohs to an<br/>audience whose thoughts were busy with the price of coal and flour,<br/>and whose lives were spent in trying to solve harder riddles than<br/>that of the Sphinx.<br/><br/>They were early, and while Miss Crocker set the heel of her<br/>stocking, Jo amused herself by examining the faces of the people<br/>who occupied the seat with them. On her left were two matrons, with<br/>massive foreheads and bonnets to match, discussing Women's Rights<br/>and making tatting. Beyond sat a pair of humble lovers, artlessly<br/>holding each other by the hand, a somber spinster eating<br/>peppermints out of a paper bag, and an old gentleman taking his<br/>preparatory nap behind a yellow bandanna. On her right, her only<br/>neighbor was a studious looking lad absorbed in a newspaper.<br/><br/>It was a pictorial sheet, and Jo examined the work of art<br/>nearest her, idly wondering what fortuitous concatenation of<br/>circumstances needed the melodramatic illustration of an Indian in<br/>full war costume, tumbling over a precipice with a wolf at his<br/>throat, while two infuriated young gentlemen, with unnaturally<br/>small feet and big eyes, were stabbing each other close by, and a<br/>disheveled female was flying away in the background with her mouth<br/>wide open. Pausing to turn a page, the lad saw her looking and,<br/>with boyish good nature offered half his paper, saying bluntly,<br/>"want to read it? That's a first-rate story."<br/><br/>Jo accepted it with a smile, for she had never outgrown her<br/>liking for lads, and soon found herself involved in the usual<br/>labyrinth of love, mystery, and murder, for the story belonged to<br/>that class of light literature in which the passions have a<br/>holiday, and when the author's invention fails, a grand catastrophe<br/>clears the stage of one half the dramatis personae, leaving the<br/>other half to exult over their downfall.<br/>
