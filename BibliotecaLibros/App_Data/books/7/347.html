While Laurie listlessly watched the procession of priests under<br/>their canopies, white-veiled nuns bearing lighted tapers, and some<br/>brotherhood in blue chanting as they walked, Amy watched him, and<br/>felt a new sort of shyness steal over her, for he was changed, and<br/>she could not find the merry-faced boy she left in the<br/>moody-looking man beside her. He was handsomer than ever and<br/>greatly improved, she thought, but now that the flush of pleasure<br/>at meeting her was over, he looked tired and spiritlessâ€”not sick,<br/>nor exactly unhappy, but older and graver than a year or two of<br/>prosperous life should have made him. She couldn't understand it<br/>and did not venture to ask questions, so she shook her head and<br/>touched up her ponies, as the procession wound away across the<br/>arches of the Paglioni bridge and vanished in the church.<br/><br/>"Que pensez-vous?" she said, airing her French, which had<br/>improved in quantity, if not in quality, since she came abroad.<br/><br/>"That mademoiselle has made good use of her time, and the result<br/>is charming," replied Laurie, bowing with his hand on his heart and<br/>an admiring look.<br/><br/>She blushed with pleasure, but somehow the compliment did not<br/>satisfy her like the blunt praises he used to give her at home,<br/>when he promenaded round her on festival occasions, and told her<br/>she was 'altogether jolly', with a hearty smile and an approving<br/>pat on the head. She didn't like the new tone, for though not<br/>blase, it sounded indifferent in spite of the look.<br/><br/>"If that's the way he's going to grow up, I wish he'd stay a<br/>boy," she thought, with a curious sense of disappointment and<br/>discomfort, trying meantime to seem quite easy and gay.<br/><br/>At Avigdor's she found the precious home letters and, giving the<br/>reins to Laurie, read them luxuriously as they wound up the shady<br/>road between green hedges, where tea roses bloomed as freshly as in<br/>June.<br/><br/>"Beth is very poorly, Mother says. I often think I ought to go<br/>home, but they all say 'stay'. So I do, for I shall never have<br/>another chance like this," said Amy, looking sober over one<br/>page.<br/><br/>"I think you are right, there. You could do nothing at home, and<br/>it is a great comfort to them to know that you are well and happy,<br/>and enjoying so much, my dear."<br/><br/>He drew a little nearer, and looked more like his old self as he<br/>said that, and the fear that sometimes weighed on Amy's heart was<br/>lightened, for the look, the act, the brotherly 'my dear', seemed<br/>to assure her that if any trouble did come, she would not be alone<br/>in a strange land. Presently she laughed and showed him a small<br/>sketch of Jo in her scribbling suit, with the bow rampantly erect<br/>upon her cap, and issuing from her mouth the words, 'Genius<br/>burns!'.<br/><br/>Laurie smiled, took it, put it in his vest pocket 'to keep it<br/>from blowing away', and listened with interest to the lively letter<br/>Amy read him.<br/><br/>"This will be a regularly merry Christmas to me, with presents<br/>in the morning, you and letters in the afternoon, and a party at<br/>night," said Amy, as they alighted among the ruins of the old fort,<br/>and a flock of splendid peacocks came trooping about them, tamely<br/>waiting to be fed. While Amy stood laughing on the bank above him<br/>as she scattered crumbs to the brilliant birds, Laurie looked at<br/>her as she had looked at him, with a natural curiosity to see what<br/>changes time and absence had wrought. He found nothing to perplex<br/>or disappoint, much to admire and approve, for overlooking a few<br/>little affectations of speech and manner, she was as sprightly and<br/>graceful as ever, with the addition of that indescribable something<br/>in dress and bearing which we call elegance. Always mature for her<br/>age, she had gained a certain aplomb in both carriage and<br/>conversation, which made her seem more of a woman of the world than<br/>she was, but her old petulance now and then showed itself, her<br/>strong will still held its own, and her native frankness was<br/>unspoiled by foreign polish.<br/>
