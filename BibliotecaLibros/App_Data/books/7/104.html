<br/>It is our painful duty to record the sudden and mysterious<br/>disappearance of our cherished friend, Mrs. Snowball Pat Paw. This<br/>lovely and beloved cat was the pet of a large circle of warm and<br/>admiring friends; for her beauty attracted all eyes, her graces and<br/>virtues endeared her to all hearts, and her loss is deeply felt by<br/>the whole community.<br/><br/>When last seen, she was sitting at the gate, watching the<br/>butcher's cart, and it is feared that some villain, tempted by her<br/>charms, basely stole her. Weeks have passed, but no trace of her<br/>has been discovered, and we relinquish all hope, tie a black ribbon<br/>to her basket, set aside her dish, and weep for her as one lost to<br/>us forever.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>________<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>A sympathizing friend sends the following gem:<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>A LAMENT<br/><br/>(FOR S. B. PAT PAW)<br/><br/>We mourn the loss of our little pet,<br/>And sigh o'er her hapless fate,<br/>
