"I'm shopping."

Mr. Bhaer smiled, as he glanced from the pickle factory on one
side to the wholesale hide and leather concern on the other, but he
only said politely, "You haf no umbrella. May I go also, and take
for you the bundles?"

"Yes, thank you."

Jo's cheeks were as red as her ribbon, and she wondered what he
thought of her, but she didn't care, for in a minute she found
herself walking away arm in arm with her Professor, feeling as if
the sun had suddenly burst out with uncommon brilliancy, that the
world was all right again, and that one thoroughly happy woman was
paddling through the wet that day.

"We thought you had gone," said Jo hastily, for she knew he was
looking at her. Her bonnet wasn't big enough to hide her face, and
she feared he might think the joy it betrayed unmaidenly.

"Did you believe that I should go with no farewell to those who
haf been so heavenly kind to me?" he asked so reproachfully that
she felt as if she had insulted him by the suggestion, and answered
heartily…

"No, I didn't. I knew you were busy about your own affairs, but
we rather missed you, Father and Mother especially."

"And you?"

"I'm always glad to see you, sir."

In her anxiety to keep her voice quite calm, Jo made it rather
cool, and the frosty little monosyllable at the end seemed to chill
the Professor, for his smile vanished, as he said gravely…

"I thank you, and come one more time before I go."
