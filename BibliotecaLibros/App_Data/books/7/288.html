<br/>"Especially to gentlemen," added May, with a look which<br/>enlightened Amy as to one cause of her sudden fall from favor. She<br/>colored angrily, but took no other notice of that girlish sarcasm,<br/>and answered with unexpected amiability…<br/><br/>"It shall be as you please, Mrs. Chester. I'll give up my place<br/>here at once, and attend to the flowers, if you like."<br/><br/>"You can put your own things on your own table, if you prefer,"<br/>began May, feeling a little conscience-stricken, as she looked at<br/>the pretty racks, the painted shells, and quaint illuminations Amy<br/>had so carefully made and so gracefully arranged. She meant it<br/>kindly, but Amy mistook her meaning, and said quickly…<br/><br/>"Oh, certainly, if they are in your way," and sweeping her<br/>contributions into her apron, pell-mell, she walked off, feeling<br/>that herself and her works of art had been insulted past<br/>forgiveness.<br/><br/>"Now she's mad. Oh, dear, I wish I hadn't asked you to speak,<br/>Mama," said May, looking disconsolately at the empty spaces on her<br/>table.<br/><br/>"Girls' quarrels are soon over," returned her mother, feeling a<br/>trifle ashamed of her own part in this one, as well she might.<br/><br/>The little girls hailed Amy and her treasures with delight,<br/>which cordial reception somewhat soothed her perturbed spirit, and<br/>she fell to work, determined to succeed florally, if she could not<br/>artistically. But everything seemed against her. It was late, and<br/>she was tired. Everyone was too busy with their own affairs to help<br/>her, and the little girls were only hindrances, for the dears<br/>fussed and chattered like so many magpies, making a great deal of<br/>confusion in their artless efforts to preserve the most perfect<br/>order. The evergreen arch wouldn't stay firm after she got it up,<br/>but wiggled and threatened to tumble down on her head when the<br/>hanging baskets were filled. Her best tile got a splash of water,<br/>which left a sepia tear on the Cupid's cheek. She bruised her hands<br/>with hammering, and got cold working in a draft, which last<br/>affliction filled her with apprehensions for the morrow. Any girl<br/>reader who has suffered like afflictions will sympathize with poor<br/>Amy and wish her well through her task.<br/><br/>There was great indignation at home when she told her story that<br/>evening. Her mother said it was a shame, but told her she had done<br/>right. Beth declared she wouldn't go to the fair at all, and Jo<br/>demanded why she didn't take all her pretty things and leave those<br/>mean people to get on without her.<br/><br/>"Because they are mean is no reason why I should be. I hate such<br/>things, and though I think I've a right to be hurt, I don't intend<br/>to show it. They will feel that more than angry speeches or huffy<br/>actions, won't they, Marmee?"<br/><br/>"That's the right spirit, my dear. A kiss for a blow is always<br/>best, though it's not very easy to give it sometimes," said her<br/>mother, with the air of one who had learned the difference between<br/>preaching and practicing.<br/><br/>
