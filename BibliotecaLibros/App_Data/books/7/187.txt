"He does very well, for a boy," was Meg's somewhat ungracious
answer, for the subject did not interest her.

Dr. Bangs came, said Beth had symptoms of the fever, but he
thought she would have it lightly, though he looked sober over the
Hummel story. Amy was ordered off at once, and provided with
something to ward off danger, she departed in great state, with Jo
and Laurie as escort.

Aunt March received them with her usual hospitality.

"What do you want now?" she asked, looking sharply over her
spectacles, while the parrot, sitting on the back of her chair,
called outâ€¦

"Go away. No boys allowed here."

Laurie retired to the window, and Jo told her story.

"No more than I expected, if you are allowed to go poking about
among poor folks. Amy can stay and make herself useful if she isn't
sick, which I've no doubt she will be, looks like it now. Don't
cry, child, it worries me to hear people sniff."

Amy was on the point of crying, but Laurie slyly pulled the
parrot's tail, which caused Polly to utter an astonished croak and
call out, "Bless my boots!" in such a funny way, that she laughed
instead.

"What do you hear from your mother?" asked the old lady
gruffly.

"Father is much better," replied Jo, trying to keep sober.
