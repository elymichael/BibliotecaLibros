They always looked back before turning the corner, for their<br/>mother was always at the window to nod and smile, and wave her hand<br/>to them. Somehow it seemed as if they couldn't have got through the<br/>day without that, for whatever their mood might be, the last<br/>glimpse of that motherly face was sure to affect them like<br/>sunshine.<br/><br/>"If Marmee shook her fist instead of kissing her hand to us, it<br/>would serve us right, for more ungrateful wretches than we are were<br/>never seen," cried Jo, taking a remorseful satisfaction in the<br/>snowy walk and bitter wind.<br/><br/>"Don't use such dreadful expressions," replied Meg from the<br/>depths of the veil in which she had shrouded herself like a nun<br/>sick of the world.<br/><br/>"I like good strong words that mean something," replied Jo,<br/>catching her hat as it took a leap off her head preparatory to<br/>flying away altogether.<br/><br/>"Call yourself any names you like, but I am neither a rascal nor<br/>a wretch and I don't choose to be called so."<br/><br/>"You're a blighted being, and decidedly cross today because you<br/>can't sit in the lap of luxury all the time. Poor dear, just wait<br/>till I make my fortune, and you shall revel in carriages and ice<br/>cream and high-heeled slippers, and posies, and red-headed boys to<br/>dance with."<br/><br/>"How ridiculous you are, Jo!" But Meg laughed at the nonsense<br/>and felt better in spite of herself.<br/><br/>"Lucky for you I am, for if I put on crushed airs and tried to<br/>be dismal, as you do, we should be in a nice state. Thank goodness,<br/>I can always find something funny to keep me up. Don't croak any<br/>more, but come home jolly, there's a dear."<br/><br/>Jo gave her sister an encouraging pat on the shoulder as they<br/>parted for the day, each going a different way, each hugging her<br/>little warm turnover, and each trying to be cheerful in spite of<br/>wintry weather, hard work, and the unsatisfied desires of<br/>pleasure-loving youth.<br/><br/>When Mr. March lost his property in trying to help an<br/>unfortunate friend, the two oldest girls begged to be allowed to do<br/>something toward their own support, at least. Believing that they<br/>could not begin too early to cultivate energy, industry, and<br/>independence, their parents consented, and both fell to work with<br/>the hearty good will which in spite of all obstacles is sure to<br/>succeed at last.<br/><br/>Margaret found a place as nursery governess and felt rich with<br/>her small salary. As she said, she was 'fond of luxury', and her<br/>chief trouble was poverty. She found it harder to bear than the<br/>others because she could remember a time when home was beautiful,<br/>life full of ease and pleasure, and want of any kind unknown. She<br/>tried not to be envious or discontented, but it was very natural<br/>that the young girl should long for pretty things, gay friends,<br/>accomplishments, and a happy life. At the Kings' she daily saw all<br/>she wanted, for the children's older sisters were just out, and Meg<br/>caught frequent glimpses of dainty ball dresses and bouquets, heard<br/>lively gossip about theaters, concerts, sleighing parties, and<br/>merrymakings of all kinds, and saw money lavished on trifles which<br/>would have been so precious to her. Poor Meg seldom complained, but<br/>a sense of injustice made her feel bitter toward everyone<br/>sometimes, for she had not yet learned to know how rich she was in<br/>the blessings which alone can make life happy.<br/>
