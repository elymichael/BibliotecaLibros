They found Mr. Laurence standing before the fire in the great<br/>drawing room, but Jo's attention was entirely absorbed by a grand<br/>piano, which stood open.<br/><br/>"Do you play?" she asked, turning to Laurie with a respectful<br/>expression.<br/><br/>"Sometimes," he answered modestly.<br/><br/>"Please do now. I want to hear it, so I can tell Beth."<br/><br/>"Won't you first?"<br/><br/>"Don't know how. Too stupid to learn, but I love music<br/>dearly."<br/><br/>So Laurie played and Jo listened, with her nose luxuriously<br/>buried in heliotrope and tea roses. Her respect and regard for the<br/>'Laurence' boy increased very much, for he played remarkably well<br/>and didn't put on any airs. She wished Beth could hear him, but she<br/>did not say so, only praised him till he was quite abashed, and his<br/>grandfather came to his rescue.<br/><br/>"That will do, that will do, young lady. Too many sugarplums are<br/>not good for him. His music isn't bad, but I hope he will do as<br/>well in more important things. Going? well, I'm much obliged to<br/>you, and I hope you'll come again. My respects to your mother. Good<br/>night, Doctor Jo."<br/><br/>He shook hands kindly, but looked as if something did not please<br/>him. When they got into the hall, Jo asked Laurie if she had said<br/>something amiss. He shook his head.<br/><br/>"No, it was me. He doesn't like to hear me play."<br/><br/>"Why not?"<br/>
