"It's your little mind, Demi," replied the sage, stroking the
yellow head respectfully.

"What is a little mine?"

"It is something which makes your body move, as the spring made
the wheels go in my watch when I showed it to you."

"Open me. I want to see it go wound."

"I can't do that any more than you could open the watch. God
winds you up, and you go till He stops you."

"Does I?" and Demi's brown eyes grew big and bright as he took
in the new thought. "Is I wounded up like the watch?"

"Yes, but I can't show you how, for it is done when we don't
see."

Demi felt his back, as if expecting to find it like that of the
watch, and then gravely remarked, "I dess Dod does it when I's
asleep."

A careful explanation followed, to which he listened so
attentively that his anxious grandmother said, "My dear, do you
think it wise to talk about such things to that baby? He's getting
great bumps over his eyes, and learning to ask the most
unanswerable questions."

"If he is old enough to ask the question he is old enough to
receive true answers. I am not putting the thoughts into his head,
but helping him unfold those already there. These children are
wiser than we are, and I have no doubt the boy understands every
word I have said to him. Now, Demi, tell me where you keep your
mind."
