"Quite right and proper. I like your grateful spirit, my dear.<br/>It's a pleasure to help people who appreciate our efforts. Some do<br/>not, and that is trying," observed Aunt March, looking over her<br/>spectacles at Jo, who sat apart, rocking herself, with a somewhat<br/>morose expression.<br/><br/>If Jo had only known what a great happiness was wavering in the<br/>balance for one of them, she would have turned dove-like in a<br/>minute, but unfortunately, we don't have windows in our breasts,<br/>and cannot see what goes on in the minds of our friends. Better for<br/>us that we cannot as a general thing, but now and then it would be<br/>such a comfort, such a saving of time and temper. By her next<br/>speech, Jo deprived herself of several years of pleasure, and<br/>received a timely lesson in the art of holding her tongue.<br/><br/>"I don't like favors, they oppress and make me feel like a<br/>slave. I'd rather do everything for myself, and be perfectly<br/>independent."<br/><br/>"Ahem!" coughed Aunt Carrol softly, with a look at Aunt<br/>March.<br/><br/>"I told you so," said Aunt March, with a decided nod to Aunt<br/>Carrol.<br/><br/>Mercifully unconscious of what she had done, Jo sat with her<br/>nose in the air, and a revolutionary aspect which was anything but<br/>inviting.<br/><br/>"Do you speak French, dear?" asked Mrs. Carrol, laying a hand on<br/>Amy's.<br/><br/>"Pretty well, thanks to Aunt March, who lets Esther talk to me<br/>as often as I like," replied Amy, with a grateful look, which<br/>caused the old lady to smile affably.<br/><br/>"How are you about languages?" asked Mrs. Carrol of Jo.<br/><br/>"Don't know a word. I'm very stupid about studying anything,<br/>can't bear French, it's such a slippery, silly sort of language,"<br/>was the brusque reply.<br/><br/>Another look passed between the ladies, and Aunt March said to<br/>Amy, "You are quite strong and well now, dear, I believe? Eyes<br/>don't trouble you any more, do they?"<br/>
