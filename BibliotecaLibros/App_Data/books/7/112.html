<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>11<br/>Experiments<br/><br/><br/>"The first of June! The Kings are off to the seashore tomorrow,<br/>and I'm free. Three months' vacation—how I shall enjoy it!"<br/>exclaimed Meg, coming home one warm day to find Jo laid upon the<br/>sofa in an unusual state of exhaustion, while Beth took off her<br/>dusty boots, and Amy made lemonade for the refreshment of the whole<br/>party.<br/><br/>"Aunt March went today, for which, oh, be joyful!" said Jo. "I<br/>was mortally afraid she'd ask me to go with her. If she had, I<br/>should have felt as if I ought to do it, but Plumfield is about as<br/>gay as a churchyard, you know, and I'd rather be excused. We had a<br/>flurry getting the old lady off, and I had a fright every time she<br/>spoke to me, for I was in such a hurry to be through that I was<br/>uncommonly helpful and sweet, and feared she'd find it impossible<br/>to part from me. I quaked till she was fairly in the carriage, and<br/>had a final fright, for as it drove of, she popped out her head,<br/>saying, 'Josyphine, won't you—?' I didn't hear any more, for I<br/>basely turned and fled. I did actually run, and whisked round the<br/>corner where I felt safe."<br/><br/>"Poor old Jo! She came in looking as if bears were after her,"<br/>said Beth, as she cuddled her sister's feet with a motherly<br/>air.<br/><br/>"Aunt March is a regular samphire, is she not?" observed Amy,<br/>tasting her mixture critically.<br/><br/>"She means vampire, not seaweed, but it doesn't matter. It's too<br/>warm to be particular about one's parts of speech," murmured<br/>Jo.<br/><br/>"What shall you do all your vacation?" asked Amy, changing the<br/>subject with tact.<br/><br/>"I shall lie abed late, and do nothing," replied Meg, from the<br/>depths of the rocking chair. "I've been routed up early all winter<br/>and had to spend my days working for other people, so now I'm going<br/>to rest and revel to my heart's content."<br/>
