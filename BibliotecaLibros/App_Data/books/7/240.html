<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>1<br/>Gossip<br/><br/><br/>In order that we may start afresh and go to Meg's wedding with<br/>free minds, it will be well to begin with a little gossip about the<br/>Marches. And here let me premise that if any of the elders think<br/>there is too much 'lovering' in the story, as I fear they may (I'm<br/>not afraid the young folks will make that objection), I can only<br/>say with Mrs. March, "What can you expect when I have four gay<br/>girls in the house, and a dashing young neighbor over the way?"<br/><br/>The three years that have passed have brought but few changes to<br/>the quiet family. The war is over, and Mr. March safely at home,<br/>busy with his books and the small parish which found in him a<br/>minister by nature as by grace, a quiet, studious man, rich in the<br/>wisdom that is better than learning, the charity which calls all<br/>mankind 'brother', the piety that blossoms into character, making<br/>it august and lovely.<br/><br/>These attributes, in spite of poverty and the strict integrity<br/>which shut him out from the more worldly successes, attracted to<br/>him many admirable persons, as naturally as sweet herbs draw bees,<br/>and as naturally he gave them the honey into which fifty years of<br/>hard experience had distilled no bitter drop. Earnest young men<br/>found the gray-headed scholar as young at heart as they; thoughtful<br/>or troubled women instinctively brought their doubts to him, sure<br/>of finding the gentlest sympathy, the wisest counsel. Sinners told<br/>their sins to the pure-hearted old man and were both rebuked and<br/>saved. Gifted men found a companion in him. Ambitious men caught<br/>glimpses of nobler ambitions than their own, and even worldlings<br/>confessed that his beliefs were beautiful and true, although 'they<br/>wouldn't pay'.<br/><br/>To outsiders the five energetic women seemed to rule the house,<br/>and so they did in many things, but the quiet scholar, sitting<br/>among his books, was still the head of the family, the household<br/>conscience, anchor, and comforter, for to him the busy, anxious<br/>women always turned in troublous times, finding him, in the truest<br/>sense of those sacred words, husband and father.<br/><br/>The girls gave their hearts into their mother's keeping, their<br/>souls into their father's, and to both parents, who lived and<br/>labored so faithfully for them, they gave a love that grew with<br/>their growth and bound them tenderly together by the sweetest tie<br/>which blesses life and outlives death.<br/><br/>Mrs. March is as brisk and cheery, though rather grayer, than<br/>when we saw her last, and just now so absorbed in Meg's affairs<br/>that the hospitals and homes still full of wounded 'boys' and<br/>soldiers' widows, decidedly miss the motherly missionary's<br/>visits.<br/><br/>John Brooke did his duty manfully for a year, got wounded, was<br/>sent home, and not allowed to return. He received no stars or bars,<br/>but he deserved them, for he cheerfully risked all he had, and life<br/>and love are very precious when both are in full bloom. Perfectly<br/>resigned to his discharge, he devoted himself to getting well,<br/>preparing for business, and earning a home for Meg. With the good<br/>sense and sturdy independence that characterized him, he refused<br/>Mr. Laurence's more generous offers, and accepted the place of<br/>bookkeeper, feeling better satisfied to begin with an honestly<br/>earned salary than by running any risks with borrowed money.<br/>
