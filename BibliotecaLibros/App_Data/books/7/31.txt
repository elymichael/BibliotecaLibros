"It's my sister Margaret, and you knew it was! Do you think she
is pretty?"

"Yes, she makes me think of the German girls, she looks so fresh
and quiet, and dances like a lady."

Jo quite glowed with pleasure at this boyish praise of her
sister, and stored it up to repeat to Meg. Both peeped and
critisized and chatted till they felt like old acquaintances.
Laurie's bashfulness soon wore off, for Jo's gentlemanly demeanor
amused and set him at his ease, and Jo was her merry self again,
because her dress was forgotten and nobody lifted their eyebrows at
her. She liked the 'Laurence boy' better than ever and took several
good looks at him, so that she might describe him to the girls, for
they had no brothers, very few male cousins, and boys were almost
unknown creatures to them.

"Curly black hair, brown skin, big black eyes, handsome nose,
fine teeth, small hands and feet, taller than I am, very polite,
for a boy, and altogether jolly. Wonder how old he is?"

It was on the tip of Jo's tongue to ask, but she checked herself
in time and, with unusual tact, tried to find out in a round-about
way.

"I suppose you are going to college soon? I see you pegging away
at your books, no, I mean studying hard." And Jo blushed at the
dreadful 'pegging' which had escaped her.

Laurie smiled but didn't seem shocked, and answered with a
shrug. "Not for a year or two. I won't go before seventeen,
anyway."

"Aren't you but fifteen?" asked Jo, looking at the tall lad,
whom she had imagined seventeen already.

"Sixteen, next month."

"How I wish I was going to college! You don't look as if you
liked it."
