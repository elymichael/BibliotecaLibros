<br/>"You are so generous and kind-hearted that you let people<br/>borrow, and can't say 'No' to anyone. We heard about Henshaw and<br/>all you did for him. If you always spent money in that way, no one<br/>would blame you," said Jo warmly.<br/><br/>"Oh, he made a mountain out of a molehill. You wouldn't have me<br/>let that fine fellow work himself to death just for want of a<br/>little help, when he is worth a dozen of us lazy chaps, would<br/>you?"<br/><br/>"Of course not, but I don't see the use of your having seventeen<br/>waistcoats, endless neckties, and a new hat every time you come<br/>home. I thought you'd got over the dandy period, but every now and<br/>then it breaks out in a new spot. Just now it's the fashion to be<br/>hideous, to make your head look like a scrubbing brush, wear a<br/>strait jacket, orange gloves, and clumping square-toed boots. If it<br/>was cheap ugliness, I'd say nothing, but it costs as much as the<br/>other, and I don't get any satisfaction out of it."<br/><br/>Laurie threw back his head, and laughed so heartily at this<br/>attack, that the felt hat fell off, and Jo walked on it, which<br/>insult only afforded him an opportunity for expatiating on the<br/>advantages of a rough-and-ready costume, as he folded up the<br/>maltreated hat, and stuffed it into his pocket.<br/><br/>"Don't lecture any more, there's a good soul! I have enough all<br/>through the week, and like to enjoy myself when I come home. I'll<br/>get myself up regardless of expense tomorrow and be a satisfaction<br/>to my friends."<br/><br/>"I'll leave you in peace if you'll only let your hair grow. I'm<br/>not aristocratic, but I do object to being seen with a person who<br/>looks like a young prize fighter," observed Jo severely.<br/><br/>"This unassuming style promotes study, that's why we adopt it,"<br/>returned Laurie, who certainly could not be accused of vanity,<br/>having voluntarily sacrificed a handsome curly crop to the demand<br/>for quarter-inch-long stubble.<br/><br/>"By the way, Jo, I think that little Parker is really getting<br/>desperate about Amy. He talks of her constantly, writes poetry, and<br/>moons about in a most suspicious manner. He'd better nip his little<br/>passion in the bud, hadn't he?" added Laurie, in a confidential,<br/>elder brotherly tone, after a minute's silence.<br/><br/>"Of course he had. We don't want any more marrying in this<br/>family for years to come. Mercy on us, what are the children<br/>thinking of?" and Jo looked as much scandalized as if Amy and<br/>little Parker were not yet in their teens.<br/><br/>"It's a fast age, and I don't know what we are coming to, ma'am.<br/>You are a mere infant, but you'll go next, Jo, and we'll be left<br/>lamenting," said Laurie, shaking his head over the degeneracy of<br/>the times.<br/><br/>
