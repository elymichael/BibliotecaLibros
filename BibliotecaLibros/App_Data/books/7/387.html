With praiseworthy discretion, the good lady said nothing, and<br/>betrayed no sign of enlightenment, but cordially urged Laurie to<br/>stay and begged Amy to enjoy his society, for it would do her more<br/>good than so much solitude. Amy was a model of docility, and as her<br/>aunt was a good deal occupied with Flo, she was left to entertain<br/>her friend, and did it with more than her usual success.<br/><br/>At Nice, Laurie had lounged and Amy had scolded. At Vevay,<br/>Laurie was never idle, but always walking, riding, boating, or<br/>studying in the most energetic manner, while Amy admired everything<br/>he did and followed his example as far and as fast as she could. He<br/>said the change was owing to the climate, and she did not<br/>contradict him, being glad of a like excuse for her own recovered<br/>health and spirits.<br/><br/>The invigorating air did them both good, and much exercise<br/>worked wholesome changes in minds as well as bodies. They seemed to<br/>get clearer views of life and duty up there among the everlasting<br/>hills. The fresh winds blew away desponding doubts, delusive<br/>fancies, and moody mists. The warm spring sunshine brought out all<br/>sorts of aspiring ideas, tender hopes, and happy thoughts. The lake<br/>seemed to wash away the troubles of the past, and the grand old<br/>mountains to look benignly down upon them saying, "Little children,<br/>love one another."<br/><br/>In spite of the new sorrow, it was a very happy time, so happy<br/>that Laurie could not bear to disturb it by a word. It took him a<br/>little while to recover from his surprise at the cure of his first,<br/>and as he had firmly believed, his last and only love. He consoled<br/>himself for the seeming disloyalty by the thought that Jo's sister<br/>was almost the same as Jo's self, and the conviction that it would<br/>have been impossible to love any other woman but Amy so soon and so<br/>well. His first wooing had been of the tempestuous order, and he<br/>looked back upon it as if through a long vista of years with a<br/>feeling of compassion blended with regret. He was not ashamed of<br/>it, but put it away as one of the bitter-sweet experiences of his<br/>life, for which he could be grateful when the pain was over. His<br/>second wooing, he resolved, should be as calm and simple as<br/>possible. There was no need of having a scene, hardly any need of<br/>telling Amy that he loved her, she knew it without words and had<br/>given him his answer long ago. It all came about so naturally that<br/>no one could complain, and he knew that everybody would be pleased,<br/>even Jo. But when our first little passion has been crushed, we are<br/>apt to be wary and slow in making a second trial, so Laurie let the<br/>days pass, enjoying every hour, and leaving to chance the utterance<br/>of the word that would put an end to the first and sweetest part of<br/>his new romance.<br/><br/>He had rather imagined that the denoument would take place in<br/>the chateau garden by moonlight, and in the most graceful and<br/>decorous manner, but it turned out exactly the reverse, for the<br/>matter was settled on the lake at noonday in a few blunt words.<br/>They had been floating about all the morning, from gloomy St.<br/>Gingolf to sunny Montreux, with the Alps of Savoy on one side, Mont<br/>St. Bernard and the Dent du Midi on the other, pretty Vevay in the<br/>valley, and Lausanne upon the hill beyond, a cloudless blue sky<br/>overhead, and the bluer lake below, dotted with the picturesque<br/>boats that look like white-winged gulls.<br/><br/>They had been talking of Bonnivard, as they glided past Chillon,<br/>and of Rousseau, as they looked up at Clarens, where he wrote his<br/>Heloise. Neither had read it, but they knew it was a love story,<br/>and each privately wondered if it was half as interesting as their<br/>own. Amy had been dabbling her hand in the water during the little<br/>pause that fell between them, and when she looked up, Laurie was<br/>leaning on his oars with an expression in his eyes that made her<br/>say hastily, merely for the sake of saying somethingâ€¦<br/><br/>"You must be tired. Rest a little, and let me row. It will do me<br/>good, for since you came I have been altogether lazy and<br/>luxurious."<br/><br/>"I'm not tired, but you may take an oar, if you like. There's<br/>room enough, though I have to sit nearly in the middle, else the<br/>boat won't trim," returned Laurie, as if he rather liked the<br/>arrangement.<br/><br/>Feeling that she had not mended matters much, Amy took the<br/>offered third of a seat, shook her hair over her face, and accepted<br/>an oar. She rowed as well as she did many other things, and though<br/>she used both hands, and Laurie but one, the oars kept time, and<br/>the boat went smoothly through the water.<br/><br/>"How well we pull together, don't we?" said Amy, who objected to<br/>silence just then.<br/><br/>"So well that I wish we might always pull in the same boat. Will<br/>you, Amy?" very tenderly.<br/>
