"You are so generous and kind-hearted that you let people
borrow, and can't say 'No' to anyone. We heard about Henshaw and
all you did for him. If you always spent money in that way, no one
would blame you," said Jo warmly.

"Oh, he made a mountain out of a molehill. You wouldn't have me
let that fine fellow work himself to death just for want of a
little help, when he is worth a dozen of us lazy chaps, would
you?"

"Of course not, but I don't see the use of your having seventeen
waistcoats, endless neckties, and a new hat every time you come
home. I thought you'd got over the dandy period, but every now and
then it breaks out in a new spot. Just now it's the fashion to be
hideous, to make your head look like a scrubbing brush, wear a
strait jacket, orange gloves, and clumping square-toed boots. If it
was cheap ugliness, I'd say nothing, but it costs as much as the
other, and I don't get any satisfaction out of it."

Laurie threw back his head, and laughed so heartily at this
attack, that the felt hat fell off, and Jo walked on it, which
insult only afforded him an opportunity for expatiating on the
advantages of a rough-and-ready costume, as he folded up the
maltreated hat, and stuffed it into his pocket.

"Don't lecture any more, there's a good soul! I have enough all
through the week, and like to enjoy myself when I come home. I'll
get myself up regardless of expense tomorrow and be a satisfaction
to my friends."

"I'll leave you in peace if you'll only let your hair grow. I'm
not aristocratic, but I do object to being seen with a person who
looks like a young prize fighter," observed Jo severely.

"This unassuming style promotes study, that's why we adopt it,"
returned Laurie, who certainly could not be accused of vanity,
having voluntarily sacrificed a handsome curly crop to the demand
for quarter-inch-long stubble.

"By the way, Jo, I think that little Parker is really getting
desperate about Amy. He talks of her constantly, writes poetry, and
moons about in a most suspicious manner. He'd better nip his little
passion in the bud, hadn't he?" added Laurie, in a confidential,
elder brotherly tone, after a minute's silence.

"Of course he had. We don't want any more marrying in this
family for years to come. Mercy on us, what are the children
thinking of?" and Jo looked as much scandalized as if Amy and
little Parker were not yet in their teens.

"It's a fast age, and I don't know what we are coming to, ma'am.
You are a mere infant, but you'll go next, Jo, and we'll be left
lamenting," said Laurie, shaking his head over the degeneracy of
the times.
