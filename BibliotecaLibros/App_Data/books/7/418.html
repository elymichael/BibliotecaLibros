<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>23<br/>Under the Umbrella<br/><br/><br/>While Laurie and Amy were taking conjugal strolls over velvet<br/>carpets, as they set their house in order, and planned a blissful<br/>future, Mr. Bhaer and Jo were enjoying promenades of a different<br/>sort, along muddy roads and sodden fields.<br/><br/>"I always do take a walk toward evening, and I don't know why I<br/>should give it up, just because I happen to meet the Professor on<br/>his way out," said Jo to herself, after two or three encounters,<br/>for though there were two paths to Meg's whichever one she took she<br/>was sure to meet him, either going or returning. He was always<br/>walking rapidly, and never seemed to see her until quite close,<br/>when he would look as if his short-sighted eyes had failed to<br/>recognize the approaching lady till that moment. Then, if she was<br/>going to Meg's he always had something for the babies. If her face<br/>was turned homeward, he had merely strolled down to see the river,<br/>and was just returning, unless they were tired of his frequent<br/>calls.<br/><br/>Under the circumstances, what could Jo do but greet him civilly,<br/>and invite him in? If she was tired of his visits, she concealed<br/>her weariness with perfect skill, and took care that there should<br/>be coffee for supper, "as Friedrich—I mean Mr. Bhaer—doesn't like<br/>tea."<br/><br/>By the second week, everyone knew perfectly well what was going<br/>on, yet everyone tried to look as if they were stone-blind to the<br/>changes in Jo's face. They never asked why she sang about her work,<br/>did up her hair three times a day, and got so blooming with her<br/>evening exercise. And no one seemed to have the slightest suspicion<br/>that Professor Bhaer, while talking philosophy with the father, was<br/>giving the daughter lessons in love.<br/><br/>Jo couldn't even lose her heart in a decorous manner, but<br/>sternly tried to quench her feelings, and failing to do so, led a<br/>somewhat agitated life. She was mortally afraid of being laughed at<br/>for surrendering, after her many and vehement declarations of<br/>independence. Laurie was her especial dread, but thanks to the new<br/>manager, he behaved with praiseworthy propriety, never called Mr.<br/>Bhaer 'a capital old fellow' in public, never alluded, in the<br/>remotest manner, to Jo's improved appearance, or expressed the<br/>least surprise at seeing the Professor's hat on the Marches' table<br/>nearly every evening. But he exulted in private and longed for the<br/>time to come when he could give Jo a piece of plate, with a bear<br/>and a ragged staff on it as an appropriate coat of arms.<br/><br/>For a fortnight, the Professor came and went with lover-like<br/>regularity. Then he stayed away for three whole days, and made no<br/>sign, a proceeding which caused everybody to look sober, and Jo to<br/>become pensive, at first, and then—alas for romance—very cross.<br/><br/>"Disgusted, I dare say, and gone home as suddenly as he came.<br/>It's nothing to me, of course, but I should think he would have<br/>come and bid us goodbye like a gentleman," she said to herself,<br/>with a despairing look at the gate, as she put on her things for<br/>the customary walk one dull afternoon.<br/>
