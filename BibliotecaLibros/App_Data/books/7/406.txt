Mrs. March was not so blind to her children's interest as Mrs.

"I suspect that is a wise man," remarked Mr. March, with placid
satisfaction, from the hearthrug, after the last guest had
gone.

"I know he is a good one," added Mrs. March, with decided
approval, as she wound up the clock.

"I thought you'd like him," was all Jo said, as she slipped away
to her bed.

She wondered what the business was that brought Mr. Bhaer to the
city, and finally decided that he had been appointed to some great
honor, somewhere, but had been too modest to mention the fact. If
she had seen his face when, safe in his own room, he looked at the
picture of a severe and rigid young lady, with a good deal of hair,
who appeared to be gazing darkly into futurity, it might have
thrown some light upon the subject, especially when he turned off
the gas, and kissed the picture in the dark.
