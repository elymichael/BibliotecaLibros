"Let it go, it has done its duty, and I will haf a fresh one<br/>when I read all the brown book in which she keeps her little<br/>secrets," said Mr. Bhaer with a smile as he watched the fragments<br/>fly away on the wind. "Yes," he added earnestly, "I read that, and<br/>I think to myself, She has a sorrow, she is lonely, she would find<br/>comfort in true love. I haf a heart full, full for her. Shall I not<br/>go and say, 'If this is not too poor a thing to gif for what I<br/>shall hope to receive, take it in Gott's name?'"<br/><br/>"And so you came to find that it was not too poor, but the one<br/>precious thing I needed," whispered Jo.<br/><br/>"I had no courage to think that at first, heavenly kind as was<br/>your welcome to me. But soon I began to hope, and then I said, 'I<br/>will haf her if I die for it,' and so I will!" cried Mr. Bhaer,<br/>with a defiant nod, as if the walls of mist closing round them were<br/>barriers which he was to surmount or valiantly knock down.<br/><br/>Jo thought that was splendid, and resolved to be worthy of her<br/>knight, though he did not come prancing on a charger in gorgeous<br/>array.<br/><br/>"What made you stay away so long?" she asked presently, finding<br/>it so pleasant to ask confidential questions and get delightful<br/>answers that she could not keep silent.<br/><br/>"It was not easy, but I could not find the heart to take you<br/>from that so happy home until I could haf a prospect of one to gif<br/>you, after much time, perhaps, and hard work. How could I ask you<br/>to gif up so much for a poor old fellow, who has no fortune but a<br/>little learning?"<br/><br/>"I'm glad you are poor. I couldn't bear a rich husband," said Jo<br/>decidedly, adding in a softer tone, "Don't fear poverty. I've known<br/>it long enough to lose my dread and be happy working for those I<br/>love, and don't call yourself old—forty is the prime of life. I<br/>couldn't help loving you if you were seventy!"<br/><br/>The Professor found that so touching that he would have been<br/>glad of his handkerchief, if he could have got at it. As he<br/>couldn't, Jo wiped his eyes for him, and said, laughing, as she<br/>took away a bundle or two…<br/><br/>"I may be strong-minded, but no one can say I'm out of my sphere<br/>now, for woman's special mission is supposed to be drying tears and<br/>bearing burdens. I'm to carry my share, Friedrich, and help to earn<br/>the home. Make up your mind to that, or I'll never go," she added<br/>resolutely, as he tried to reclaim his load.<br/><br/>"We shall see. Haf you patience to wait a long time, Jo? I must<br/>go away and do my work alone. I must help my boys first, because,<br/>even for you, I may not break my word to Minna. Can you forgif<br/>that, and be happy while we hope and wait?"<br/><br/>"Yes, I know I can, for we love one another, and that makes all<br/>the rest easy to bear. I have my duty, also, and my work. I<br/>couldn't enjoy myself if I neglected them even for you, so there's<br/>no need of hurry or impatience. You can do your part out West, I<br/>can do mine here, and both be happy hoping for the best, and<br/>leaving the future to be as God wills."<br/>
