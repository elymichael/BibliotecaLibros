Up went Jo, and knocked smartly on the door of Laurie's little
study.

"Stop that, or I'll open the door and make you!" called out the
young gentleman in a threatening tone.

Jo immediately knocked again. The door flew open, and in she
bounced before Laurie could recover from his surprise. Seeing that
he really was out of temper, Jo, who knew how to manage him,
assumed a contrite expression, and going artistically down upon her
knees, said meekly, "Please forgive me for being so cross. I came
to make it up, and can't go away till I have."

"It's all right. Get up, and don't be a goose, Jo," was the
cavalier reply to her petition.

"Thank you, I will. Could I ask what's the matter? You don't
look exactly easy in your mind."

"I've been shaken, and I won't bear it!" growled Laurie
indignantly.

"Who did it?" demanded Jo.

"Grandfather. If it had been anyone else I'd haveâ€¦ " And the
injured youth finished his sentence by an energetic gesture of the
right arm.

"That's nothing. I often shake you, and you don't mind," said Jo
soothingly.
