"It is so beautiful to be loved as Laurie loves me. He isn't<br/>sentimental, doesn't say much about it, but I see and feel it in<br/>all he says and does, and it makes me so happy and so humble that I<br/>don't seem to be the same girl I was. I never knew how good and<br/>generous and tender he was till now, for he lets me read his heart,<br/>and I find it full of noble impulses and hopes and purposes, and am<br/>so proud to know it's mine. He says he feels as if he 'could make a<br/>prosperous voyage now with me aboard as mate, and lots of love for<br/>ballast'. I pray he may, and try to be all he believes me, for I<br/>love my gallant captain with all my heart and soul and might, and<br/>never will desert him, while God lets us be together. Oh, Mother, I<br/>never knew how much like heaven this world could be, when two<br/>people love and live for one another!"<br/><br/>"And that's our cool, reserved, and worldly Amy! Truly, love<br/>does work miracles. How very, very happy they must be!" and Jo laid<br/>the rustling sheets together with a careful hand, as one might shut<br/>the covers of a lovely romance, which holds the reader fast till<br/>the end comes, and he finds himself alone in the workaday world<br/>again.<br/><br/>By-and-by Jo roamed away upstairs, for it was rainy, and she<br/>could not walk. A restless spirit possessed her, and the old<br/>feeling came again, not bitter as it once was, but a sorrowfully<br/>patient wonder why one sister should have all she asked, the other<br/>nothing. It was not true, she knew that and tried to put it away,<br/>but the natural craving for affection was strong, and Amy's<br/>happiness woke the hungry longing for someone to 'love with heart<br/>and soul, and cling to while God let them be together'. Up in the<br/>garret, where Jo's unquiet wanderings ended stood four little<br/>wooden chests in a row, each marked with its owners name, and each<br/>filled with relics of the childhood and girlhood ended now for all.<br/>Jo glanced into them, and when she came to her own, leaned her chin<br/>on the edge, and stared absently at the chaotic collection, till a<br/>bundle of old exercise books caught her eye. She drew them out,<br/>turned them over, and relived that pleasant winter at kind Mrs.<br/>Kirke's. She had smiled at first, then she looked thoughtful, next<br/>sad, and when she came to a little message written in the<br/>Professor's hand, her lips began to tremble, the books slid out of<br/>her lap, and she sat looking at the friendly words, as they took a<br/>new meaning, and touched a tender spot in her heart.<br/><br/>"Wait for me, my friend. I may be a little late, but I shall<br/>surely come."<br/><br/>"Oh, if he only would! So kind, so good, so patient with me<br/>always, my dear old Fritz. I didn't value him half enough when I<br/>had him, but now how I should love to see him, for everyone seems<br/>going away from me, and I'm all alone."<br/><br/>And holding the little paper fast, as if it were a promise yet<br/>to be fulfilled, Jo laid her head down on a comfortable rag bag,<br/>and cried, as if in opposition to the rain pattering on the<br/>roof.<br/><br/>Was it all self-pity, loneliness, or low spirits? Or was it the<br/>waking up of a sentiment which had bided its time as patiently as<br/>its inspirer? Who shall say?<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
