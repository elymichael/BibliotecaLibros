"Boy and girl. Aren't they beauties?" said the proud papa,<br/>beaming upon the little red squirmers as if they were unfledged<br/>angels.<br/><br/>"Most remarkable children I ever saw. Which is which?" and<br/>Laurie bent like a well-sweep to examine the prodigies.<br/><br/>"Amy put a blue ribbon on the boy and a pink on the girl, French<br/>fashion, so you can always tell. Besides, one has blue eyes and one<br/>brown. Kiss them, Uncle Teddy," said wicked Jo.<br/><br/>"I'm afraid they mightn't like it," began Laurie, with unusual<br/>timidity in such matters.<br/><br/>"Of course they will, they are used to it now. Do it this<br/>minute, sir!" commanded Jo, fearing he might propose a proxy.<br/><br/>Laurie screwed up his face and obeyed with a gingerly peck at<br/>each little cheek that produced another laugh, and made the babies<br/>squeal.<br/><br/>"There, I knew they didn't like it! That's the boy, see him<br/>kick, he hits out with his fists like a good one. Now then, young<br/>Brooke, pitch into a man of your own size, will you?" cried Laurie,<br/>delighted with a poke in the face from a tiny fist, flapping<br/>aimlessly about.<br/><br/>"He's to be named John Laurence, and the girl Margaret, after<br/>mother and grandmother. We shall call her Daisey, so as not to have<br/>two Megs, and I suppose the mannie will be Jack, unless we find a<br/>better name," said Amy, with aunt-like interest.<br/><br/>"Name him Demijohn, and call him Demi for short," said<br/>Laurie<br/><br/>"Daisy and Demi, just the thing! I knew Teddy would do it,"<br/>cried Jo clapping her hands.<br/><br/>Teddy certainly had done it that time, for the babies were<br/>'Daisy' and 'Demi' to the end of the chapter.<br/>
