<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>6<br/>Beth Finds the Palace Beautiful<br/><br/><br/>The big house did prove a Palace Beautiful, though it took some<br/>time for all to get in, and Beth found it very hard to pass the<br/>lions. Old Mr. Laurence was the biggest one, but after he had<br/>called, said something funny or kind to each one of the girls, and<br/>talked over old times with their mother, nobody felt much afraid of<br/>him, except timid Beth. The other lion was the fact that they were<br/>poor and Laurie rich, for this made them shy of accepting favors<br/>which they could not return. But, after a while, they found that he<br/>considered them the benefactors, and could not do enough to show<br/>how grateful he was for Mrs. March's motherly welcome, their<br/>cheerful society, and the comfort he took in that humble home of<br/>theirs. So they soon forgot their pride and interchanged kindnesses<br/>without stopping to think which was the greater.<br/><br/>All sorts of pleasant things happened about that time, for the<br/>new friendship flourished like grass in spring. Every one liked<br/>Laurie, and he privately informed his tutor that "the Marches were<br/>regularly splendid girls." With the delightful enthusiasm of youth,<br/>they took the solitary boy into their midst and made much of him,<br/>and he found something very charming in the innocent companionship<br/>of these simple-hearted girls. Never having known mother or<br/>sisters, he was quick to feel the influences they brought about<br/>him, and their busy, lively ways made him ashamed of the indolent<br/>life he led. He was tired of books, and found people so interesting<br/>now that Mr. Brooke was obliged to make very unsatisfactory<br/>reports, for Laurie was always playing truant and running over to<br/>the Marches'.<br/><br/>"Never mind, let him take a holiday, and make it up afterward,"<br/>said the old gentleman. "The good lady next door says he is<br/>studying too hard and needs young society, amusement, and exercise.<br/>I suspect she is right, and that I've been coddling the fellow as<br/>if I'd been his grandmother. Let him do what he likes, as long as<br/>he is happy. He can't get into mischief in that little nunnery over<br/>there, and Mrs. March is doing more for him than we can."<br/><br/>What good times they had, to be sure. Such plays and tableaux,<br/>such sleigh rides and skating frolics, such pleasant evenings in<br/>the old parlor, and now and then such gay little parties at the<br/>great house. Meg could walk in the conservatory whenever she liked<br/>and revel in bouquets, Jo browsed over the new library voraciously,<br/>and convulsed the old gentleman with her criticisms, Amy copied<br/>pictures and enjoyed beauty to her heart's content, and Laurie<br/>played 'lord of the manor' in the most delightful style.<br/><br/>But Beth, though yearning for the grand piano, could not pluck<br/>up courage to go to the 'Mansion of Bliss', as Meg called it. She<br/>went once with Jo, but the old gentleman, not being aware of her<br/>infirmity, stared at her so hard from under his heavy eyebrows, and<br/>said "Hey!" so loud, that he frightened her so much her 'feet<br/>chattered on the floor', she never told her mother, and she ran<br/>away, declaring she would never go there any more, not even for the<br/>dear piano. No persuasions or enticements could overcome her fear,<br/>till, the fact coming to Mr. Laurence's ear in some mysterious way,<br/>he set about mending matters. During one of the brief calls he<br/>made, he artfully led the conversation to music, and talked away<br/>about great singers whom he had seen, fine organs he had heard, and<br/>told such charming anecdotes that Beth found it impossible to stay<br/>in her distant corner, but crept nearer and nearer, as if<br/>fascinated. At the back of his chair she stopped and stood<br/>listening, with her great eyes wide open and her cheeks red with<br/>excitement of this unusual performance. Taking no more notice of<br/>her than if she had been a fly, Mr. Laurence talked on about<br/>Laurie's lessons and teachers. And presently, as if the idea had<br/>just occurred to him, he said to Mrs. March…<br/><br/>"The boy neglects his music now, and I'm glad of it, for he was<br/>getting too fond of it. But the piano suffers for want of use.<br/>Wouldn't some of your girls like to run over, and practice on it<br/>now and then, just to keep it in tune, you know, ma'am?"<br/><br/>Beth took a step forward, and pressed her hands tightly together<br/>to keep from clapping them, for this was an irresistible<br/>temptation, and the thought of practicing on that splendid<br/>instrument quite took her breath away. Before Mrs. March could<br/>reply, Mr. Laurence went on with an odd little nod and smile…<br/>
