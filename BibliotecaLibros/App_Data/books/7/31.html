<br/>"It's my sister Margaret, and you knew it was! Do you think she<br/>is pretty?"<br/><br/>"Yes, she makes me think of the German girls, she looks so fresh<br/>and quiet, and dances like a lady."<br/><br/>Jo quite glowed with pleasure at this boyish praise of her<br/>sister, and stored it up to repeat to Meg. Both peeped and<br/>critisized and chatted till they felt like old acquaintances.<br/>Laurie's bashfulness soon wore off, for Jo's gentlemanly demeanor<br/>amused and set him at his ease, and Jo was her merry self again,<br/>because her dress was forgotten and nobody lifted their eyebrows at<br/>her. She liked the 'Laurence boy' better than ever and took several<br/>good looks at him, so that she might describe him to the girls, for<br/>they had no brothers, very few male cousins, and boys were almost<br/>unknown creatures to them.<br/><br/>"Curly black hair, brown skin, big black eyes, handsome nose,<br/>fine teeth, small hands and feet, taller than I am, very polite,<br/>for a boy, and altogether jolly.

I see you pegging away<br/>at your books, no, I mean studying hard." And Jo blushed at the<br/>dreadful 'pegging' which had escaped her.<br/><br/>Laurie smiled but didn't seem shocked, and answered with a<br/>shrug. "Not for a year or two. I won't go before seventeen,<br/>anyway."<br/><br/>"Aren't you but fifteen?" asked Jo, looking at the tall lad,<br/>whom she had imagined seventeen already.<br/><br/>"Sixteen, next month."<br/><br/>"How I wish I was going to college! You don't look as if you<br/>liked it."<br/><br/>
