<br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Gondola after gondola swept up to the marble steps, and left its<br/>lovely load to swell the brilliant throng that filled the stately<br/>halls of Count Adelon. Knights and ladies, elves and pages, monks<br/>and flower girls, all mingled gaily in the dance. Sweet voices and<br/>rich melody filled the air, and so with mirth and music the<br/>masquerade went on. "Has your Highness seen the Lady Viola<br/>tonight?" asked a gallant troubadour of the fairy queen who floated<br/>down the hall upon his arm.<br/><br/>"Yes, is she not lovely, though so sad! Her dress is well<br/>chosen, too, for in a week she weds Count Antonio, whom she<br/>passionately hates."<br/><br/>"By my faith, I envy him. Yonder he comes, arrayed like a<br/>bridegroom, except the black mask. When that is off we shall see<br/>how he regards the fair maid whose heart he cannot win, though her<br/>stern father bestows her hand," returned the troubadour.<br/><br/>"Tis whispered that she loves the young English artist who<br/>haunts her steps, and is spurned by the old Count," said the lady,<br/>as they joined the dance. The revel was at its height when a priest<br/>appeared, and withdrawing the young pair to an alcove, hung with<br/>purple velvet, he motioned them to kneel. Instant silence fell on<br/>the gay throng, and not a sound, but the dash of fountains or the<br/>rustle of orange groves sleeping in the moonlight, broke the hush,<br/>as Count de Adelon spoke thus:<br/><br/>"My lords and ladies, pardon the ruse by which I have gathered<br/>you here to witness the marriage of my daughter. Father, we wait<br/>your services." All eyes turned toward the bridal party, and a<br/>murmur of amazement went through the throng, for neither bride nor<br/>groom removed their masks. Curiosity and wonder possessed all<br/>hearts, but respect restrained all tongues till the holy rite was<br/>over. Then the eager spectators gathered round the count, demanding<br/>an explanation.<br/><br/>"Gladly would I give it if I could, but I only know that it was<br/>the whim of my timid Viola, and I yielded to it. Now, my children,<br/>let the play end. Unmask and receive my blessing."<br/><br/>But neither bent the knee, for the young bridegroom replied in a<br/>tone that startled all listeners as the mask fell, disclosing the<br/>noble face of Ferdinand Devereux, the artist lover, and leaning on<br/>the breast where now flashed the star of an English earl was the<br/>lovely Viola, radiant with joy and beauty.<br/><br/>"My lord, you scornfully bade me claim your daughter when I<br/>could boast as high a name and vast a fortune as the Count Antonio.<br/>I can do more, for even your ambitious soul cannot refuse the Earl<br/>of Devereux and De Vere, when he gives his ancient name and<br/>boundless wealth in return for the beloved hand of this fair lady,<br/>now my wife."<br/><br/>The count stood like one changed to stone, and turning to the<br/>bewildered crowd, Ferdinand added, with a gay smile of triumph, "To<br/>you, my gallant friends, I can only wish that your wooing may<br/>prosper as mine has done, and that you may all win as fair a bride<br/>as I have by this masked marriage."<br/><br/>
