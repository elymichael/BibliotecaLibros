"No, no. I mean what do you intend and wish to do?"

"Smoke a cigarette, if you'll allow me."

"How provoking you are! I don't approve of cigars and I will
only allow it on condition that you let me put you into my sketch.
I need a figure."

"With all the pleasure in life. How will you have me, full
length or three-quarters, on my head or my heels? I should
respectfully suggest a recumbent posture, then put yourself in also
and call it 'Dolce far niente'."

"Stay as you are, and go to sleep if you like. I intend to work
hard," said Amy in her most energetic tone.

"What delightful enthusiasm!" and he leaned against a tall urn
with an air of entire satisfaction.

"What would Jo say if she saw you now?" asked Amy impatiently,
hoping to stir him up by the mention of her still more energetic
sister's name.

"As usual, 'Go away, Teddy. I'm busy!'" He laughed as he spoke,
but the laugh was not natural, and a shade passed over his face,
for the utterance of the familiar name touched the wound that was
not healed yet. Both tone and shadow struck Amy, for she had seen
and heard them before, and now she looked up in time to catch a new
expression on Laurie's faceâ€”a hard bitter look, full of pain,
dissatisfaction, and regret. It was gone before she could study it
and the listless expression back again. She watched him for a
moment with artistic pleasure, thinking how like an Italian he
looked, as he lay basking in the sun with uncovered head and eyes
full of southern dreaminess, for he seemed to have forgotten her
and fallen into a reverie.

"You look like the effigy of a young knight asleep on his tomb,"
she said, carefully tracing the well-cut profile defined against
the dark stone.

"Wish I was!"
