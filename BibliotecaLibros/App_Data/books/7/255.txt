"My lady," as her friends called her, sincerely desired to be a
genuine lady, and was so at heart, but had yet to learn that money
cannot buy refinement of nature, that rank does not always confer
nobility, and that true breeding makes itself felt in spite of
external drawbacks.

"I want to ask a favor of you, Mamma," Amy said, coming in with
an important air one day.

"Well, little girl, what is it?" replied her mother, in whose
eyes the stately young lady still remained 'the baby'.

"Our drawing class breaks up next week, and before the girls
separate for the summer, I want to ask them out here for a day.
They are wild to see the river, sketch the broken bridge, and copy
some of the things they admire in my book. They have been very kind
to me in many ways, and I am grateful, for they are all rich and I
know I am poor, yet they never made any difference."

"Why should they?" and Mrs. March put the question with what the
girls called her 'Maria Theresa air'.

"You know as well as I that it does make a difference with
nearly everyone, so don't ruffle up like a dear, motherly hen, when
your chickens get pecked by smarter birds. The ugly duckling turned
out a swan, you know." and Amy smiled without bitterness, for she
possessed a happy temper and hopeful spirit.

Mrs. March laughed, and smoothed down her maternal pride as she
asked, "Well, my swan, what is your plan?"

"I should like to ask the girls out to lunch next week, to take
them for a drive to the places they want to see, a row on the
river, perhaps, and make a little artistic fete for them."

"That looks feasible. What do you want for lunch? Cake,
sandwiches, fruit, and coffee will be all that is necessary, I
suppose?"

"Oh, dear, no! We must have cold tongue and chicken, French
chocolate and ice cream, besides. The girls are used to such
things, and I want my lunch to be proper and elegant, though I do
work for my living."
