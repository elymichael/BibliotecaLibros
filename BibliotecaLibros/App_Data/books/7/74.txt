"You know something about it, and you'd better tell at once, or
I'll make you." And Jo gave her a slight shake.

"Scold as much as you like, you'll never see your silly old book
again," cried Amy, getting excited in her turn.

"Why not?"

"I burned it up."

"What! My little book I was so fond of, and worked over, and
meant to finish before Father got home? Have you really burned it?"
said Jo, turning very pale, while her eyes kindled and her hands
clutched Amy nervously.

"Yes, I did! I told you I'd make you pay for being so cross
yesterday, and I have, so… "

Amy got no farther, for Jo's hot temper mastered her, and she
shook Amy till her teeth chattered in her head, crying in a passion
of grief and anger…

"You wicked, wicked girl! I never can write it again, and I'll
never forgive you as long as I live."

Meg flew to rescue Amy, and Beth to pacify Jo, but Jo was quite
beside herself, and with a parting box on her sister's ear, she
rushed out of the room up to the old sofa in the garret, and
finished her fight alone.

The storm cleared up below, for Mrs. March came home, and,
having heard the story, soon brought Amy to a sense of the wrong
she had done her sister. Jo's book was the pride of her heart, and
was regarded by her family as a literary sprout of great promise.
It was only half a dozen little fairy tales, but Jo had worked over
them patiently, putting her whole heart into her work, hoping to
make something good enough to print. She had just copied them with
great care, and had destroyed the old manuscript, so that Amy's
bonfire had consumed the loving work of several years. It seemed a
small loss to others, but to Jo it was a dreadful calamity, and she
felt that it never could be made up to her. Beth mourned as for a
departed kitten, and Meg refused to defend her pet. Mrs. March
looked grave and grieved, and Amy felt that no one would love her
till she had asked pardon for the act which she now regretted more
than any of them.
