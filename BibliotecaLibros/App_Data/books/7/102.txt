Mr. Pickwick, Sir:â€”

I address you upon the subject of sin the sinner I mean is a man
named Winkle who makes trouble in his club by laughing and
sometimes won't write his piece in this fine paper I hope you will
pardon his badness and let him send a French fable because he can't
write out of his head as he has so many lessons to do and no brains
in future I will try to take time by the fetlock and prepare some
work which will be all commy la fo that means all right I am in
haste as it is nearly school time.

Yours respectably,

N. WINKLE

misdemeanors. If our young friend studied punctuation, it would be
well.]
