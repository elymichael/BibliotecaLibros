"Doesn't Meg pull fair?" asked Laurie, looking indignant.<br/><br/>"Oh, yes, she tries to, but she can't love Bethy as I do, and<br/>she won't miss her as I shall. Beth is my conscience, and I can't<br/>give her up. I can't! I can't!"<br/><br/>Down went Jo's face into the wet handkerchief, and she cried<br/>despairingly, for she had kept up bravely till now and never shed a<br/>tear. Laurie drew his hand across his eyes, but could not speak<br/>till he had subdued the choky feeling in his throat and steadied<br/>his lips. It might be unmanly, but he couldn't help it, and I am<br/>glad of it. Presently, as Jo's sobs quieted, he said hopefully, "I<br/>don't think she will die. She's so good, and we all love her so<br/>much, I don't believe God will take her away yet."<br/><br/>"The good and dear people always do die," groaned Jo, but she<br/>stopped crying, for her friend's words cheered her up in spite of<br/>her own doubts and fears.<br/><br/>"Poor girl, you're worn out. It isn't like you to be forlorn.<br/>Stop a bit. I'll hearten you up in a jiffy."<br/><br/>Laurie went off two stairs at a time, and Jo laid her wearied<br/>head down on Beth's little brown hood, which no one had thought of<br/>moving from the table where she left it. It must have possessed<br/>some magic, for the submissive spirit of its gentle owner seemed to<br/>enter into Jo, and when Laurie came running down with a glass of<br/>wine, she took it with a smile, and said bravely, "I drinkâ€” Health<br/>to my Beth! You are a good doctor, Teddy, and such a comfortable<br/>friend. How can I ever pay you?" she added, as the wine refreshed<br/>her body, as the kind words had done her troubled mind.<br/><br/>"I'll send my bill, by-and-by, and tonight I'll give you<br/>something that will warm the cockles of your heart better than<br/>quarts of wine," said Laurie, beaming at her with a face of<br/>suppressed satisfaction at something.<br/><br/>"What is it?" cried Jo, forgetting her woes for a minute in her<br/>wonder.<br/><br/>"I telegraphed to your mother yesterday, and Brooke answered<br/>she'd come at once, and she'll be here tonight, and everything will<br/>be all right. Aren't you glad I did it?"<br/><br/>Laurie spoke very fast, and turned red and excited all in a<br/>minute, for he had kept his plot a secret, for fear of<br/>disappointing the girls or harming Beth. Jo grew quite white, flew<br/>out of her chair, and the moment he stopped speaking she<br/>electrified him by throwing her arms round his neck, and crying<br/>out, with a joyful cry, "Oh, Laurie! Oh, Mother! I am so glad!" She<br/>did not weep again, but laughed hysterically, and trembled and<br/>clung to her friend as if she was a little bewildered by the sudden<br/>news.<br/><br/>Laurie, though decidedly amazed, behaved with great presence of<br/>mind. He patted her back soothingly, and finding that she was<br/>recovering, followed it up by a bashful kiss or two, which brought<br/>Jo round at once. Holding on to the banisters, she put him gently<br/>away, saying breathlessly, "Oh, don't! I didn't mean to, it was<br/>dreadful of me, but you were such a dear to go and do it in spite<br/>of Hannah that I couldn't help flying at you. Tell me all about it,<br/>and don't give me wine again, it makes me act so."<br/>
