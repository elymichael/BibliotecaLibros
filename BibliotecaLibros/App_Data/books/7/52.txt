"The doctor to see you, sir," and the maid beckoned as she
spoke.

"Would you mind if I left you for a minute? I suppose I must see
him," said Laurie.

"Don't mind me. I'm happy as a cricket here," answered Jo.

Laurie went away, and his guest amused herself in her own way.
She was standing before a fine portrait of the old gentleman when
the door opened again, and without turning, she said decidedly,
"I'm sure now that I shouldn't be afraid of him, for he's got kind
eyes, though his mouth is grim, and he looks as if he had a
tremendous will of his own. He isn't as handsome as my grandfather,
but I like him."

"Thank you, ma'am," said a gruff voice behind her, and there, to
her great dismay, stood old Mr. Laurence.

Poor Jo blushed till she couldn't blush any redder, and her
heart began to beat uncomfortably fast as she thought what she had
said. For a minute a wild desire to run away possessed her, but
that was cowardly, and the girls would laugh at her, so she
resolved to stay and get out of the scrape as she could. A second
look showed her that the living eyes, under the bushy eyebrows,
were kinder even than the painted ones, and there was a sly twinkle
in them, which lessened her fear a good deal. The gruff voice was
gruffer than ever, as the old gentleman said abruptly, after the
dreadful pause, "So you're not afraid of me, hey?"

"Not much, sir."

"And you don't think me as handsome as your grandfather?"

"Not quite, sir."

"And I've got a tremendous will, have I?"
