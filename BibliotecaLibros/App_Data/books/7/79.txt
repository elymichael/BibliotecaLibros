"I hope you will be a great deal better, dear, but you must keep
watch over your 'bosom enemy', as father calls it, or it may
sadden, if not spoil your life. You have had a warning. Remember
it, and try with heart and soul to master this quick temper, before
it brings you greater sorrow and regret than you have known
today."

"I will try, Mother, I truly will. But you must help me, remind
me, and keep me from flying out. I used to see Father sometimes put
his finger on his lips, and look at you with a very kind but sober
face, and you always folded your lips tight and went away. Was he
reminding you then?" asked Jo softly.

"Yes. I asked him to help me so, and he never forgot it, but
saved me from many a sharp word by that little gesture and kind
look."

Jo saw that her mother's eyes filled and her lips trembled as
she spoke, and fearing that she had said too much, she whispered
anxiously, "Was it wrong to watch you and to speak of it? I didn't
mean to be rude, but it's so comfortable to say all I think to you,
and feel so safe and happy here."

"My Jo, you may say anything to your mother, for it is my
greatest happiness and pride to feel that my girls confide in me
and know how much I love them."

"I thought I'd grieved you."

"No, dear, but speaking of Father reminded me how much I miss
him, how much I owe him, and how faithfully I should watch and work
to keep his little daughters safe and good for him."

"Yet you told him to go, Mother, and didn't cry when he went,
and never complain now, or seem as if you needed any help," said
Jo, wondering.

"I gave my best to the country I love, and kept my tears till he
was gone. Why should I complain, when we both have merely done our
duty and will surely be the happier for it in the end? If I don't
seem to need help, it is because I have a better friend, even than
Father, to comfort and sustain me. My child, the troubles and
temptations of your life are beginning and may be many, but you can
overcome and outlive them all if you learn to feel the strength and
tenderness of your Heavenly Father as you do that of your earthly
one. The more you love and trust Him, the nearer you will feel to
Him, and the less you will depend on human power and wisdom. His
love and care never tire or change, can never be taken from you,
but may become the source of lifelong peace, happiness, and
strength. Believe this heartily, and go to God with all your little
cares, and hopes, and sins, and sorrows, as freely and confidingly
as you come to your mother."

Jo's only answer was to hold her mother close, and in the
silence which followed the sincerest prayer she had ever prayed
left her heart without words. For in that sad yet happy hour, she
had learned not only the bitterness of remorse and despair, but the
sweetness of self-denial and self-control, and led by her mother's
hand, she had drawn nearer to the Friend who always welcomes every
child with a love stronger than that of any father, tenderer than
that of any mother.

Amy stirred and sighed in her sleep, and as if eager to begin at
once to mend her fault, Jo looked up with an expression on her face
which it had never worn before.
