"Here's the place for my errands. Will you come in? It won't
take long."

Jo rather prided herself upon her shopping capabilities, and
particularly wished to impress her escort with the neatness and
dispatch with which she would accomplish the business. But owing to
the flutter she was in, everything went amiss. She upset the tray
of needles, forgot the silesia was to be 'twilled' till it was cut
off, gave the wrong change, and covered herself with confusion by
asking for lavender ribbon at the calico counter. Mr. Bhaer stood
by, watching her blush and blunder, and as he watched, his own
bewilderment seemed to subside, for he was beginning to see that on
some occasions, women, like dreams, go by contraries.

When they came out, he put the parcel under his arm with a more
cheerful aspect, and splashed through the puddles as if he rather
enjoyed it on the whole.

"Should we no do a little what you call shopping for the babies,
and haf a farewell feast tonight if I go for my last call at your
so pleasant home?" he asked, stopping before a window full of fruit
and flowers.

"What will we buy?" asked Jo, ignoring the latter part of his
speech, and sniffing the mingled odors with an affectation of
delight as they went in.

"May they haf oranges and figs?" asked Mr. Bhaer, with a
paternal air.

"They eat them when they can get them."

"Do you care for nuts?"

"Like a squirrel."

"Hamburg grapes. Yes, we shall drink to the Fatherland in
those?"

Jo frowned upon that piece of extravagance, and asked why he
didn't buy a frail of dates, a cask of raisins, and a bag of
almonds, and be done with it? Whereat Mr. Bhaer confiscated her
purse, produced his own, and finished the marketing by buying
several pounds of grapes, a pot of rosy daisies, and a pretty jar
of honey, to be regarded in the light of a demijohn. Then
distorting his pockets with knobby bundles, and giving her the
flowers to hold, he put up the old umbrella, and they traveled on
again.
