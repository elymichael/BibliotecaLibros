"And bring me back the minute Beth is well?"

"The identical minute."

"And go to the theater, truly?"

"A dozen theaters, if we may."

"Wellâ€”I guess I will," said Amy slowly.

"Good girl! Call Meg, and tell her you'll give in," said Laurie,
with an approving pat, which annoyed Amy more than the 'giving
in'.

Meg and Jo came running down to behold the miracle which had
been wrought, and Amy, feeling very precious and self-sacrificing,
promised to go, if the doctor said Beth was going to be ill.

"How is the little dear?" asked Laurie, for Beth was his
especial pet, and he felt more anxious about her than he liked to
show.

"She is lying down on Mother's bed, and feels better. The baby's
death troubled her, but I dare say she has only got cold. Hannah
says she thinks so, but she looks worried, and that makes me
fidgety," answered Meg.
