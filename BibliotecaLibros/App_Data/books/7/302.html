<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>9<br/>Tender Troubles<br/><br/><br/>"Jo, I'm anxious about Beth."<br/><br/>"Why, Mother, she has seemed unusually well since the babies<br/>came."<br/><br/>"It's not her health that troubles me now, it's her spirits. I'm<br/>sure there is something on her mind, and I want you to discover<br/>what it is."<br/><br/>"What makes you think so, Mother?"<br/><br/>"She sits alone a good deal, and doesn't talk to her father as<br/>much as she used. I found her crying over the babies the other day.<br/>When she sings, the songs are always sad ones, and now and then I<br/>see a look in her face that I don't understand. This isn't like<br/>Beth, and it worries me."<br/><br/>"Have you asked her about it?"<br/><br/>"I have tried once or twice, but she either evaded my questions<br/>or looked so distressed that I stopped. I never force my children's<br/>confidence, and I seldom have to wait for long."<br/>
