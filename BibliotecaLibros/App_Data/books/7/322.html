<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>11<br/>A<br/>Friend<br/><br/><br/>Though very happy in the social atmosphere about her, and very<br/>busy with the daily work that earned her bread and made it sweeter<br/>for the effort, Jo still found time for literary labors. The<br/>purpose which now took possession of her was a natural one to a<br/>poor and ambitious girl, but the means she took to gain her end<br/>were not the best. She saw that money conferred power, money and<br/>power, therefore, she resolved to have, not to be used for herself<br/>alone, but for those whom she loved more than life. The dream of<br/>filling home with comforts, giving Beth everything she wanted, from<br/>strawberries in winter to an organ in her bedroom, going abroad<br/>herself, and always having more than enough, so that she might<br/>indulge in the luxury of charity, had been for years Jo's most<br/>cherished castle in the air.<br/><br/>The prize-story experience had seemed to open a way which might,<br/>after long traveling and much uphill work, lead to this delightful<br/>chateau en Espagne. But the novel disaster quenched her courage for<br/>a time, for public opinion is a giant which has frightened<br/>stouter-hearted Jacks on bigger beanstalks than hers. Like that<br/>immortal hero, she reposed awhile after the first attempt, which<br/>resulted in a tumble and the least lovely of the giant's treasures,<br/>if I remember rightly. But the 'up again and take another' spirit<br/>was as strong in Jo as in Jack, so she scrambled up on the shady<br/>side this time and got more booty, but nearly left behind her what<br/>was far more precious than the moneybags.<br/><br/>She took to writing sensation stories, for in those dark ages,<br/>even all-perfect America read rubbish. She told no one, but<br/>concocted a 'thrilling tale', and boldly carried it herself to Mr.<br/>Dashwood, editor of the Weekly Volcano. She had never read Sartor<br/>Resartus, but she had a womanly instinct that clothes possess an<br/>influence more powerful over many than the worth of character or<br/>the magic of manners. So she dressed herself in her best, and<br/>trying to persuade herself that she was neither excited nor<br/>nervous, bravely climbed two pairs of dark and dirty stairs to find<br/>herself in a disorderly room, a cloud of cigar smoke, and the<br/>presence of three gentlemen, sitting with their heels rather higher<br/>than their hats, which articles of dress none of them took the<br/>trouble to remove on her appearance. Somewhat daunted by this<br/>reception, Jo hesitated on the threshold, murmuring in much<br/>embarrassment…<br/><br/>"Excuse me, I was looking for the Weekly Volcano office. I<br/>wished to see Mr. Dashwood."<br/><br/>Down went the highest pair of heels, up rose the smokiest<br/>gentleman, and carefully cherishing his cigar between his fingers,<br/>he advanced with a nod and a countenance expressive of nothing but<br/>sleep. Feeling that she must get through the matter somehow, Jo<br/>produced her manuscript and, blushing redder and redder with each<br/>sentence, blundered out fragments of the little speech carefully<br/>prepared for the occasion.<br/><br/>"A friend of mine desired me to offer—a story—just as an<br/>experiment—would like your opinion—be glad to write more if this<br/>suits."<br/><br/>While she blushed and blundered, Mr. Dashwood had taken the<br/>manuscript, and was turning over the leaves with a pair of rather<br/>dirty fingers, and casting critical glances up and down the neat<br/>pages.<br/>
