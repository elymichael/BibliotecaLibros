She stayed till Hannah came to take her home to dinner, but she<br/>had no appetite, and could only sit and smile upon everyone in a<br/>general state of beatitude.<br/><br/>After that, the little brown hood slipped through the hedge<br/>nearly every day, and the great drawing room was haunted by a<br/>tuneful spirit that came and went unseen. She never knew that Mr.<br/>Laurence opened his study door to hear the old-fashioned airs he<br/>liked. She never saw Laurie mount guard in the hall to warn the<br/>servants away. She never suspected that the exercise books and new<br/>songs which she found in the rack were put there for her especial<br/>benefit, and when he talked to her about music at home, she only<br/>thought how kind he was to tell things that helped her so much. So<br/>she enjoyed herself heartily, and found, what isn't always the<br/>case, that her granted wish was all she had hoped. Perhaps it was<br/>because she was so grateful for this blessing that a greater was<br/>given her. At any rate she deserved both.<br/><br/>"Mother, I'm going to work Mr. Laurence a pair of slippers. He<br/>is so kind to me, I must thank him, and I don't know any other way.<br/>Can I do it?" asked Beth, a few weeks after that eventful call of<br/>his.<br/><br/>"Yes, dear. It will please him very much, and be a nice way of<br/>thanking him. The girls will help you about them, and I will pay<br/>for the making up," replied Mrs. March, who took peculiar pleasure<br/>in granting Beth's requests because she so seldom asked anything<br/>for herself.<br/><br/>After many serious discussions with Meg and Jo, the pattern was<br/>chosen, the materials bought, and the slippers begun. A cluster of<br/>grave yet cheerful pansies on a deeper purple ground was pronounced<br/>very appropriate and pretty, and Beth worked away early and late,<br/>with occasional lifts over hard parts. She was a nimble little<br/>needlewoman, and they were finished before anyone got tired of<br/>them. Then she wrote a short, simple note, and with Laurie's help,<br/>got them smuggled onto the study table one morning before the old<br/>gentleman was up.<br/><br/>When this excitement was over, Beth waited to see what would<br/>happen. All day passed and a part of the next before any<br/>acknowledgement arrived, and she was beginning to fear she had<br/>offended her crochety friend. On the afternoon of the second day,<br/>she went out to do an errand, and give poor Joanna, the invalid<br/>doll, her daily exercise. As she came up the street, on her return,<br/>she saw three, yes, four heads popping in and out of the parlor<br/>windows, and the moment they saw her, several hands were waved, and<br/>several joyful voices screamed…<br/><br/>"Here's a letter from the old gentleman! Come quick, and read<br/>it!"<br/><br/>"Oh, Beth, he's sent you… " began Amy, gesticulating with<br/>unseemly energy, but she got no further, for Jo quenched her by<br/>slamming down the window.<br/><br/>Beth hurried on in a flutter of suspense. At the door her<br/>sisters seized and bore her to the parlor in a triumphal<br/>procession, all pointing and all saying at once, "Look there! Look<br/>there!" Beth did look, and turned pale with delight and surprise,<br/>for there stood a little cabinet piano, with a letter lying on the<br/>glossy lid, directed like a sign board to "Miss Elizabeth<br/>March."<br/><br/>"For me?" gasped Beth, holding onto Jo and feeling as if she<br/>should tumble down, it was such an overwhelming thing<br/>altogether.<br/><br/>"Yes, all for you, my precious! Isn't it splendid of him? Don't<br/>you think he's the dearest old man in the world? Here's the key in<br/>the letter. We didn't open it, but we are dying to know what he<br/>says," cried Jo, hugging her sister and offering the note.<br/>
