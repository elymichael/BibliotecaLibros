said at once, "Of course you may. We should have asked you before,
only we thought you wouldn't care for such a girl's game as
this."

"I always like your games, but if Meg doesn't want me, I'll go
away."

"I've no objection, if you do something. It's against the rules
to be idle here," replied Meg gravely but graciously.

"Much obliged. I'll do anything if you'll let me stop a bit, for
it's as dull as the Desert of Sahara down there. Shall I sew, read,
cone, draw, or do all at once? Bring on your bears. I'm ready." And
Laurie sat down with a submissive expression delightful to

the book.

"Yes'm." was the meek answer, as he began, doing his best to
prove his gratitude for the favor of admission into the 'Busy Bee
Society'.

ventured to ask a few questions as a reward of merit.

"Please, ma'am, could I inquire if this highly instructive and
charming institution is a new one?"

"Would you tell him?" asked Meg of her sisters.

"He'll laugh," said Amy warningly.
