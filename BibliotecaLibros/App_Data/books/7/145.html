<br/>"Why don't you say you'd have a splendid, wise, good husband and<br/>some angelic little children? You know your castle wouldn't be<br/>perfect without," said blunt Jo, who had no tender fancies yet, and<br/>rather scorned romance, except in books.<br/><br/>"You'd have nothing but horses, inkstands, and novels in yours,"<br/>answered Meg petulantly.<br/><br/>"Wouldn't I though? I'd have a stable full of Arabian steeds,<br/>rooms piled high with books, and I'd write out of a magic inkstand,<br/>so that my works should be as famous as Laurie's music. I want to<br/>do something splendid before I go into my castle, something heroic<br/>or wonderful that won't be forgotten after I'm dead. I don't know<br/>what, but I'm on the watch for it, and mean to astonish you all<br/>some day. I think I shall write books, and get rich and famous,<br/>that would suit me, so that is my favorite dream."<br/><br/>"Mine is to stay at home safe with Father and Mother, and help<br/>take care of the family," said Beth contentedly.<br/><br/>"Don't you wish for anything else?" asked Laurie.<br/><br/>"Since I had my little piano, I am perfectly satisfied. I only<br/>wish we may all keep well and be together, nothing else."<br/><br/>"I have ever so many wishes, but the pet one is to be an artist,<br/>and go to Rome, and do fine pictures, and be the best artist in the<br/>whole world," was Amy's modest desire.<br/><br/>"We're an ambitious set, aren't we? Every one of us, but Beth,<br/>wants to be rich and famous, and gorgeous in every respect. I do<br/>wonder if any of us will ever get our wishes," said Laurie, chewing<br/>grass like a meditative calf.<br/><br/>"I've got the key to my castle in the air, but whether I can<br/>unlock the door remains to be seen," observed Jo mysteriously.<br/><br/>"I've got the key to mine, but I'm not allowed to try it. Hang<br/>college!" muttered Laurie with an impatient sigh.<br/><br/>
