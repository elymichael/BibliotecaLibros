At the word 'telegraph', Mrs. March snatched it, read the two<br/>lines it contained, and dropped back into her chair as white as if<br/>the little paper had sent a bullet to her heart. Laurie dashed<br/>downstairs for water, while Meg and Hannah supported her, and Jo<br/>read aloud, in a frightened voiceâ€¦<br/><br/><br/>Mrs. March:<br/>Your husband is very ill. Come at once.<br/>S. HALE<br/>Blank Hospital, Washington.<br/><br/><br/>How still the room was as they listened breathlessly, how<br/>strangely the day darkened outside, and how suddenly the whole<br/>world seemed to change, as the girls gathered about their mother,<br/>feeling as if all the happiness and support of their lives was<br/>about to be taken from them.<br/><br/>Mrs. March was herself again directly, read the message over,<br/>and stretched out her arms to her daughters, saying, in a tone they<br/>never forgot, "I shall go at once, but it may be too late. Oh,<br/>children, children, help me to bear it!"<br/><br/>For several minutes there was nothing but the sound of sobbing<br/>in the room, mingled with broken words of comfort, tender<br/>assurances of help, and hopeful whispers that died away in tears.<br/>Poor Hannah was the first to recover, and with unconscious wisdom<br/>she set all the rest a good example, for with her, work was panacea<br/>for most afflictions.<br/><br/>"The Lord keep the dear man! I won't waste no time a-cryin', but<br/>git your things ready right away, mum," she said heartily, as she<br/>wiped her face on her apron, gave her mistress a warm shake of the<br/>hand with her own hard one, and went away to work like three women<br/>in one.<br/><br/>"She's right, there's no time for tears now. Be calm, girls, and<br/>let me think."<br/><br/>They tried to be calm, poor things, as their mother sat up,<br/>looking pale but steady, and put away her grief to think and plan<br/>for them.<br/><br/>
