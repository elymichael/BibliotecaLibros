Mr. Dashwoods's editorial gravity relaxed into a smile, for Jo
had forgotten her 'friend', and spoken as only an author could.

"People want to be amused, not preached at, you know. Morals
don't sell nowadays." Which was not quite a correct statement, by
the way.

"You think it would do with these alterations, then?"

"Yes, it's a new plot, and pretty well worked up—language good,
and so on," was Mr. Dashwood's affable reply.

"What do you—that is, what compensation—" began Jo, not exactly
knowing how to express herself.

"Oh, yes, well, we give from twenty-five to thirty for things of
this sort. Pay when it comes out," returned Mr. Dashwood, as if
that point had escaped him. Such trifles do escape the editorial
mind, it is said.

"Very well, you can have it," said Jo, handing back the story
with a satisfied air, for after the dollar-a-column work, even
twenty-five seemed good pay.

"Shall I tell my friend you will take another if she has one
better than this?" asked Jo, unconscious of her little slip of the
tongue, and emboldened by her success.

"Well, we'll look at it. Can't promise to take it. Tell her to
make it short and spicy, and never mind the moral. What name would
your friend like to put on it?" in a careless tone.

"None at all, if you please, she doesn't wish her name to appear
and has no nom de plume," said Jo, blushing in spite of
herself.

"Just as she likes, of course. The tale will be out next week.
Will you call for the money, or shall I send it?" asked Mr.
Dashwood, who felt a natural desire to know who his new contributor
might be.
