"He has promised to be very good today, and he can be perfectly
elegant if he likes," returned Amy, and gliding away to warn
Hercules to beware of the dragon, which warning caused him to haunt
the old lady with a devotion that nearly distracted her.

There was no bridal procession, but a sudden silence fell upon
the room as Mr. March and the young couple took their places under
the green arch. Mother and sisters gathered close, as if loath to
give Meg up. The fatherly voice broke more than once, which only
seemed to make the service more beautiful and solemn. The
bridegroom's hand trembled visibly, and no one heard his replies.
But Meg looked straight up in her husband's eyes, and said, "I
will!" with such tender trust in her own face and voice that her
mother's heart rejoiced and Aunt March sniffed audibly.

Jo did not cry, though she was very near it once, and was only
saved from a demonstration by the consciousness that Laurie was
staring fixedly at her, with a comical mixture of merriment and
emotion in his wicked black eyes. Beth kept her face hidden on her
mother's shoulder, but Amy stood like a graceful statue, with a
most becoming ray of sunshine touching her white forehead and the
flower in her hair.

It wasn't at all the thing, I'm afraid, but the minute she was
fairly married, Meg cried, "The first kiss for Marmee!" and
turning, gave it with her heart on her lips. During the next
fifteen minutes she looked more like a rose than ever, for everyone
availed themselves of their privileges to the fullest extent, from
Mr. Laurence to old Hannah, who, adorned with a headdress fearfully
and wonderfully made, fell upon her in the hall, crying with a sob
and a chuckle, "Bless you, deary, a hundred times! The cake ain't
hurt a mite, and everything looks lovely."

Everybody cleared up after that, and said something brilliant,
or tried to, which did just as well, for laughter is ready when
hearts are light. There was no display of gifts, for they were
already in the little house, nor was there an elaborate breakfast,
but a plentiful lunch of cake and fruit, dressed with flowers. Mr.
Laurence and Aunt March shrugged and smiled at one another when
water, lemonade, and coffee were found to be to only sorts of
nectar which the three Hebes carried round. No one said anything,
till Laurie, who insisted on serving the bride, appeared before
her, with a loaded salver in his hand and a puzzled expression on
his face.

"Has Jo smashed all the bottles by accident?" he whispered, "or
am I merely laboring under a delusion that I saw some lying about
loose this morning?"

"No, your grandfather kindly offered us his best, and Aunt March
actually sent some, but Father put away a little for Beth, and
dispatched the rest to the Soldier's Home. You know he thinks that
wine should be used only in illness, and Mother says that neither
she nor her daughters will ever offer it to any young man under her
roof."

Meg spoke seriously and expected to see Laurie frown or laugh,
but he did neither, for after a quick look at her, he said, in his
impetuous way, "I like that! For I've seen enough harm done to wish
other women would think as you do."

"You are not made wise by experience, I hope?" and there was an
anxious accent in Meg's voice.

"No. I give you my word for it. Don't think too well of me,
either, this is not one of my temptations. Being brought up where
wine is as common as water and almost as harmless, I don't care for
it, but when a pretty girl offers it, one doesn't like to refuse,
you see."

"But you will, for the sake of others, if not for your own.
Come, Laurie, promise, and give me one more reason to call this the
happiest day of my life."
