"Can't wait, and I'm afraid I haven't much faith in ink and
dirt, though I'm grateful for your good intentions."

Meg sighed, and turned to the frostbitten garden again. Jo
groaned and leaned both elbows on the table in a despondent
attitude, but Amy spatted away energetically, and Beth, who sat at
the other window, said, smiling, "Two pleasant things are going to
happen right away. Marmee is coming down the street, and Laurie is
tramping through the garden as if he had something nice to
tell."

In they both came, Mrs. March with her usual question, "Any
letter from Father, girls?" and Laurie to say in his persuasive
way, "Won't some of you come for a drive? I've been working away at
mathematics till my head is in a muddle, and I'm going to freshen
my wits by a brisk turn. It's a dull day, but the air isn't bad,
and I'm going to take Brooke home, so it will be gay inside, if it
isn't out. Come, Jo, you and Beth will go, won't you?"

"Of course we will."

"Much obliged, but I'm busy." And Meg whisked out her
workbasket, for she had agreed with her mother that it was best,
for her at least, not to drive too often with the young
gentleman.

"We three will be ready in a minute," cried Amy, running away to
wash her hands.

"Can I do anything for you, Madam Mother?" asked Laurie, leaning
over Mrs. March's chair with the affectionate look and tone he
always gave her.

"No, thank you, except call at the office, if you'll be so kind,
dear. It's our day for a letter, and the postman hasn't been.
Father is as regular as the sun, but there's some delay on the way,
perhaps."

A sharp ring interrupted her, and a minute after Hannah came in
with a letter.

"It's one of them horrid telegraph things, mum," she said,
handling it as if she was afraid it would explode and do some
damage.
