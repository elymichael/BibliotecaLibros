"So do I, it was so smooth and pretty. But it will soon grow out
again," said Beth, coming to kiss and comfort the shorn sheep.

After various lesser mishaps, Meg was finished at last, and by
the united exertions of the entire family Jo's hair was got up and
her dress on. They looked very well in their simple suits, Meg's in
silvery drab, with a blue velvet snood, lace frills, and the pearl
pin. Jo in maroon, with a stiff, gentlemanly linen collar, and a
white chrysanthemum or two for her only ornament. Each put on one
nice light glove, and carried one soiled one, and all pronounced
the effect "quite easy and fine". Meg's high-heeled slippers were
very tight and hurt her, though she would not own it, and Jo's
nineteen hairpins all seemed stuck straight into her head, which
was not exactly comfortable, but, dear me, let us be elegant or
die.

"Have a good time, dearies!" said Mrs. March, as the sisters
went daintily down the walk. "Don't eat much supper, and come away
at eleven when I send Hannah for you." As the gate clashed behind
them, a voice cried from a windowâ€¦

"Girls, girls! Have you you both got nice pocket
handkerchiefs?"

"Yes, yes, spandy nice, and Meg has cologne on hers," cried Jo,
adding with a laugh as they went on, "I do believe Marmee would ask
that if we were all running away from an earthquake."

"It is one of her aristocratic tastes, and quite proper, for a
real lady is always known by neat boots, gloves, and handkerchief,"
replied Meg, who had a good many little 'aristocratic tastes' of
her own.

"Now don't forget to keep the bad breadth out of sight, Jo. Is
my sash right? And does my hair look very bad?" said Meg, as she
turned from the glass in Mrs. Gardiner's dressing room after a
prolonged prink.

"I know I shall forget. If you see me doing anything wrong, just
remind me by a wink, will you?" returned Jo, giving her collar a
twitch and her head a hasty brush.

"No, winking isn't ladylike. I'll lift my eyebrows if any thing
is wrong, and nod if you are all right. Now hold your shoulder
straight, and take short steps, and don't shake hands if you are
introduced to anyone. It isn't the thing."

"How do you learn all the proper ways? I never can. Isn't that
music gay?"
