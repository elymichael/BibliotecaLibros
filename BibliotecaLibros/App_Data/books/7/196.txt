"I, too, covet that, but not as a necklace. Ah, no! To me it is
a rosary, and as such I should use it like a good catholic," said
Esther, eyeing the handsome thing wistfully.

"Is it meant to use as you use the string of good-smelling
wooden beads hanging over your glass?" asked Amy.

"Truly, yes, to pray with. It would be pleasing to the saints if
one used so fine a rosary as this, instead of wearing it as a vain
bijou."

"You seem to take a great deal of comfort in your prayers,
Esther, and always come down looking quiet and satisfied. I wish I
could."

"If Mademoiselle was a Catholic, she would find true comfort,
but as that is not to be, it would be well if you went apart each
day to meditate and pray, as did the good mistress whom I served
before Madame. She had a little chapel, and in it found solacement
for much trouble."

"Would it be right for me to do so too?" asked Amy, who in her
loneliness felt the need of help of some sort, and found that she
was apt to forget her little book, now that Beth was not there to
remind her of it.

"It would be excellent and charming, and I shall gladly arrange
the little dressing room for you if you like it. Say nothing to
Madame, but when she sleeps go you and sit alone a while to think
good thoughts, and pray the dear God preserve your sister."

Esther was truly pious, and quite sincere in her advice, for she
had an affectionate heart, and felt much for the sisters in their
anxiety. Amy liked the idea, and gave her leave to arrange the
light closet next her room, hoping it would do her good.

"I wish I knew where all these pretty things would go when Aunt
March dies," she said, as she slowly replaced the shining rosary
and shut the jewel cases one by one.

"To you and your sisters. I know it, Madame confides in me. I
witnessed her will, and it is to be so," whispered Esther
smiling.
