<br/>"Bless you! He won't do that."<br/><br/>"I won't go down till he does."<br/><br/>"Now, Teddy, be sensible. Let it pass, and I'll explain what I<br/>can. You can't stay here, so what's the use of being<br/>melodramatic?"<br/><br/>"I don't intend to stay here long, anyway. I'll slip off and<br/>take a journey somewhere, and when Grandpa misses me he'll come<br/>round fast enough."<br/><br/>"I dare say, but you ought not to go and worry him."<br/><br/>"Don't preach. I'll go to Washington and see Brooke. It's gay<br/>there, and I'll enjoy myself after the troubles."<br/><br/>"What fun you'd have! I wish I could run off too," said Jo,<br/>forgetting her part of mentor in lively visions of martial life at<br/>the capital.<br/><br/>"Come on, then! Why not? You go and surprise your father, and<br/>I'll stir up old Brooke. It would be a glorious joke. Let's do it,<br/>Jo. We'll leave a letter saying we are all right, and trot off at<br/>once. I've got money enough. It will do you good, and no harm, as<br/>you go to your father."<br/><br/>For a moment Jo looked as if she would agree, for wild as the<br/>plan was, it just suited her. She was tired of care and<br/>confinement, longed for change, and thoughts of her father blended<br/>temptingly with the novel charms of camps and hospitals, liberty<br/>and fun. Her eyes kindled as they turned wistfully toward the<br/>window, but they fell on the old house opposite, and she shook her<br/>head with sorrowful decision.<br/><br/>"If I was a boy, we'd run away together, and have a capital<br/>time, but as I'm a miserable girl, I must be proper and stop at<br/>home. Don't tempt me, Teddy, it's a crazy plan."<br/><br/>
