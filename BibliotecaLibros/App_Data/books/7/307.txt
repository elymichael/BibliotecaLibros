"Yes, I do, but you'd better wait till you are through college,
on the whole, and be fitting yourself for the place meantime.
You're not half good enough forâ€”well, whoever the modest girl may
be." and Jo looked a little queer likewise, for a name had almost
escaped her.

"That I'm not!" acquiesced Laurie, with an expression of
humility quite new to him, as he dropped his eyes and absently
wound Jo's apron tassel round his finger.

"Mercy on us, this will never do," thought Jo, adding aloud, "Go
and sing to me. I'm dying for some music, and always like
yours."

"I'd rather stay here, thank you."

"Well, you can't, there isn't room. Go and make yourself useful,
since you are too big to be ornamental. I thought you hated to be
tied to a woman's apron string?" retorted Jo, quoting certain
rebellious words of his own.

"Ah, that depends on who wears the apron!" and Laurie gave an
audacious tweak at the tassel.

"Are you going?" demanded Jo, diving for the pillow.

He fled at once, and the minute it was well, "Up with the
bonnets of bonnie Dundee," she slipped away to return no more till
the young gentleman departed in high dudgeon.

Jo lay long awake that night, and was just dropping off when the
sound of a stifled sob made her fly to Beth's bedside, with the
anxious inquiry, "What is it, dear?"

"I thought you were asleep," sobbed Beth.

"Is it the old pain, my precious?"
