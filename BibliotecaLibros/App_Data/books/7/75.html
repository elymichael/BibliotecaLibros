When the tea bell rang, Jo appeared, looking so grim and<br/>unapproachable that it took all Amy's courage to say meeklyâ€¦<br/><br/>"Please forgive me, Jo. I'm very, very sorry."<br/><br/>"I never shall forgive you," was Jo's stern answer, and from<br/>that moment she ignored Amy entirely.<br/><br/>No one spoke of the great trouble, not even Mrs. March, for all<br/>had learned by experience that when Jo was in that mood words were<br/>wasted, and the wisest course was to wait till some little<br/>accident, or her own generous nature, softened Jo's resentment and<br/>healed the breach. It was not a happy evening, for though they<br/>sewed as usual, while their mother read aloud from Bremer, Scott,<br/>or Edgeworth, something was wanting, and the sweet home peace was<br/>disturbed. They felt this most when singing time came, for Beth<br/>could only play, Jo stood dumb as a stone, and Amy broke down, so<br/>Meg and Mother sang alone. But in spite of their efforts to be as<br/>cheery as larks, the flutelike voices did not seem to chord as well<br/>as usual, and all felt out of tune.<br/><br/>As Jo received her good-night kiss, Mrs. March whispered gently,<br/>"My dear, don't let the sun go down upon your anger. Forgive each<br/>other, help each other, and begin again tomorrow."<br/><br/>Jo wanted to lay her head down on that motherly bosom, and cry<br/>her grief and anger all away, but tears were an unmanly weakness,<br/>and she felt so deeply injured that she really couldn't quite<br/>forgive yet. So she winked hard, shook her head, and said gruffly<br/>because Amy was listening, "It was an abominable thing, and she<br/>doesn't deserve to be forgiven."<br/><br/>With that she marched off to bed, and there was no merry or<br/>confidential gossip that night.<br/><br/>Amy was much offended that her overtures of peace had been<br/>repulsed, and began to wish she had not humbled herself, to feel<br/>more injured than ever, and to plume herself on her superior virtue<br/>in a way which was particularly exasperating. Jo still looked like<br/>a thunder cloud, and nothing went well all day. It was bitter cold<br/>in the morning, she dropped her precious turnover in the gutter,<br/>Aunt March had an attack of the fidgets, Meg was sensitive, Beth<br/>would look grieved and wistful when she got home, and Amy kept<br/>making remarks about people who were always talking about being<br/>good and yet wouldn't even try when other people set them a<br/>virtuous example.<br/><br/>"Everybody is so hateful, I'll ask Laurie to go skating. He is<br/>always kind and jolly, and will put me to rights, I know," said Jo<br/>to herself, and off she went.<br/><br/>Amy heard the clash of skates, and looked out with an impatient<br/>exclamation.<br/><br/>"There! She promised I should go next time, for this is the last<br/>ice we shall have. But it's no use to ask such a crosspatch to take<br/>me."<br/>
