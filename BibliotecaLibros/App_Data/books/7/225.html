<br/>"Oh, tell us what they are!" cried Meg, who sat beside him.<br/><br/>"Here is one." And taking up the hand which lay on the arm of<br/>his chair, he pointed to the roughened forefinger, a burn on the<br/>back, and two or three little hard spots on the palm. "I remember a<br/>time when this hand was white and smooth, and your first care was<br/>to keep it so. It was very pretty then, but to me it is much<br/>prettier now, for in this seeming blemishes I read a little<br/>history. A burnt offering has been made to vanity, this hardened<br/>palm has earned something better than blisters, and I'm sure the<br/>sewing done by these pricked fingers will last a long time, so much<br/>good will went into the stitches. Meg, my dear, I value the womanly<br/>skill which keeps home happy more than white hands or fashionable<br/>accomplishments. I'm proud to shake this good, industrious little<br/>hand, and hope I shall not soon be asked to give it away."<br/><br/>If Meg had wanted a reward for hours of patient labor, she<br/>received it in the hearty pressure of her father's hand and the<br/>approving smile he gave her.<br/><br/>"What about Jo? Please say something nice, for she has tried so<br/>hard and been so very, very good to me," said Beth in her father's<br/>ear.<br/><br/>He laughed and looked across at the tall girl who sat opposite,<br/>with an unusually mild expression in her face.<br/><br/>"In spite of the curly crop, I don't see the 'son Jo' whom I<br/>left a year ago," said Mr. March. "I see a young lady who pins her<br/>collar straight, laces her boots neatly, and neither whistles,<br/>talks slang, nor lies on the rug as she used to do. Her face is<br/>rather thin and pale just now, with watching and anxiety, but I<br/>like to look at it, for it has grown gentler, and her voice is<br/>lower. She doesn't bounce, but moves quietly, and takes care of a<br/>certain little person in a motherly way which delights me. I rather<br/>miss my wild girl, but if I get a strong, helpful, tenderhearted<br/>woman in her place, I shall feel quite satisfied. I don't know<br/>whether the shearing sobered our black sheep, but I do know that in<br/>all Washington I couldn't find anything beautiful enough to be<br/>bought with the five-and-twenty dollars my good girl sent me."<br/><br/>Jo's keen eyes were rather dim for a minute, and her thin face<br/>grew rosy in the firelight as she received her father's praise,<br/>feeling that she did deserve a portion of it.<br/><br/>"Now, Beth," said Amy, longing for her turn, but ready to<br/>wait.<br/><br/>"There's so little of her, I'm afraid to say much, for fear she<br/>will slip away altogether, though she is not so shy as she used to<br/>be," began their father cheerfully. But recollecting how nearly he<br/>had lost her, he held her close, saying tenderly, with her cheek<br/>against his own, "I've got you safe, my Beth, and I'll keep you so,<br/>please God."<br/><br/>After a minute's silence, he looked down at Amy, who sat on the<br/>cricket at his feet, and said, with a caress of the shining<br/>hairâ€¦<br/><br/>
