Gondola after gondola swept up to the marble steps, and left its
lovely load to swell the brilliant throng that filled the stately
halls of Count Adelon. Knights and ladies, elves and pages, monks
and flower girls, all mingled gaily in the dance. Sweet voices and
rich melody filled the air, and so with mirth and music the
masquerade went on. "Has your Highness seen the Lady Viola
tonight?" asked a gallant troubadour of the fairy queen who floated
down the hall upon his arm.

"Yes, is she not lovely, though so sad! Her dress is well
chosen, too, for in a week she weds Count Antonio, whom she
passionately hates."

"By my faith, I envy him. Yonder he comes, arrayed like a
bridegroom, except the black mask. When that is off we shall see
how he regards the fair maid whose heart he cannot win, though her
stern father bestows her hand," returned the troubadour.

"Tis whispered that she loves the young English artist who
haunts her steps, and is spurned by the old Count," said the lady,
as they joined the dance. The revel was at its height when a priest
appeared, and withdrawing the young pair to an alcove, hung with
purple velvet, he motioned them to kneel. Instant silence fell on
the gay throng, and not a sound, but the dash of fountains or the
rustle of orange groves sleeping in the moonlight, broke the hush,
as Count de Adelon spoke thus:

"My lords and ladies, pardon the ruse by which I have gathered
you here to witness the marriage of my daughter. Father, we wait
your services." All eyes turned toward the bridal party, and a
murmur of amazement went through the throng, for neither bride nor
groom removed their masks. Curiosity and wonder possessed all
hearts, but respect restrained all tongues till the holy rite was
over. Then the eager spectators gathered round the count, demanding
an explanation.

"Gladly would I give it if I could, but I only know that it was
the whim of my timid Viola, and I yielded to it. Now, my children,
let the play end. Unmask and receive my blessing."

But neither bent the knee, for the young bridegroom replied in a
tone that startled all listeners as the mask fell, disclosing the
noble face of Ferdinand Devereux, the artist lover, and leaning on
the breast where now flashed the star of an English earl was the
lovely Viola, radiant with joy and beauty.

"My lord, you scornfully bade me claim your daughter when I
could boast as high a name and vast a fortune as the Count Antonio.
I can do more, for even your ambitious soul cannot refuse the Earl
of Devereux and De Vere, when he gives his ancient name and
boundless wealth in return for the beloved hand of this fair lady,
now my wife."

The count stood like one changed to stone, and turning to the
bewildered crowd, Ferdinand added, with a gay smile of triumph, "To
you, my gallant friends, I can only wish that your wooing may
prosper as mine has done, and that you may all win as fair a bride
as I have by this masked marriage."
