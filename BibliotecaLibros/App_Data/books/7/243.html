<br/>"I did after a while, not to 'mess' but to learn of Hannah how<br/>things should be done, that my servants need not laugh at me. It<br/>was play then, but there came a time when I was truly grateful that<br/>I not only possessed the will but the power to cook wholesome food<br/>for my little girls, and help myself when I could no longer afford<br/>to hire help. You begin at the other end, Meg, dear, but the<br/>lessons you learn now will be of use to you by-and-by when John is<br/>a richer man, for the mistress of a house, however splendid, should<br/>know how work ought to be done, if she wishes to be well and<br/>honestly served."<br/><br/>"Yes, Mother, I'm sure of that," said Meg, listening<br/>respectfully to the little lecture, for the best of women will hold<br/>forth upon the all absorbing subject of house keeping. "Do you know<br/>I like this room most of all in my baby house," added Meg, a minute<br/>after, as they went upstairs and she looked into her well-stored<br/>linen closet.<br/><br/>Beth was there, laying the snowy piles smoothly on the shelves<br/>and exulting over the goodly array. All three laughed as Meg spoke,<br/>for that linen closet was a joke. You see, having said that if Meg<br/>married 'that Brooke' she shouldn't have a cent of her money, Aunt<br/>March was rather in a quandary when time had appeased her wrath and<br/>made her repent her vow. She never broke her word, and was much<br/>exercised in her mind how to get round it, and at last devised a<br/>plan whereby she could satisfy herself. Mrs. Carrol, Florence's<br/>mamma, was ordered to buy, have made, and marked a generous supply<br/>of house and table linen, and send it as her present, all of which<br/>was faithfully done, but the secret leaked out, and was greatly<br/>enjoyed by the family, for Aunt March tried to look utterly<br/>unconscious, and insisted that she could give nothing but the<br/>old-fashioned pearls long promised to the first bride.<br/><br/>"That's a housewifely taste which I am glad to see. I had a<br/>young friend who set up housekeeping with six sheets, but she had<br/>finger bowls for company and that satisfied her," said Mrs. March,<br/>patting the damask tablecloths, with a truly feminine appreciation<br/>of their fineness.<br/><br/>"I haven't a single finger bowl, but this is a setout that will<br/>last me all my days, Hannah says." And Meg looked quite contented,<br/>as well she might.<br/><br/>A tall, broad-shouldered young fellow, with a cropped head, a<br/>felt basin of a hat, and a flyaway coat, came tramping down the<br/>road at a great pace, walked over the low fence without stopping to<br/>open the gate, straight up to Mrs. March, with both hands out and a<br/>heartyâ€¦<br/><br/>"Here I am, Mother! Yes, it's all right."<br/><br/>The last words were in answer to the look the elder lady gave<br/>him, a kindly questioning look which the handsome eyes met so<br/>frankly that the little ceremony closed, as usual, with a motherly<br/>kiss.<br/><br/>"For Mrs. John Brooke, with the maker's congratulations and<br/>compliments. Bless you, Beth! What a refreshing spectacle you are,<br/>Jo. Amy, you are getting altogether too handsome for a single<br/>lady."<br/><br/>As Laurie spoke, he delivered a brown paper parcel to Meg,<br/>pulled Beth's hair ribbon, stared at Jo's big pinafore, and fell<br/>into an attitude of mock rapture before Amy, then shook hands all<br/>round, and everyone began to talk.<br/><br/>
