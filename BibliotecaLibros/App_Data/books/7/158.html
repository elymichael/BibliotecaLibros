"Well, I won't for the present, anyway, but I'm disgusted, and<br/>wish you hadn't told me."<br/><br/>"I thought you'd be pleased."<br/><br/>"At the idea of anybody coming to take Meg away? No, thank<br/>you."<br/><br/>"You'll feel better about it when somebody comes to take you<br/>away."<br/><br/>"I'd like to see anyone try it," cried Jo fiercely.<br/><br/>"So should I!" and Laurie chuckled at the idea.<br/><br/>"I don't think secrets agree with me, I feel rumpled up in my<br/>mind since you told me that," said Jo rather ungratefully.<br/><br/>"Race down this hill with me, and you'll be all right,"<br/>suggested Laurie.<br/><br/>No one was in sight, the smooth road sloped invitingly before<br/>her, and finding the temptation irresistible, Jo darted away, soon<br/>leaving hat and comb behind her and scattering hairpins as she ran.<br/>Laurie reached the goal first and was quite satisfied with the<br/>success of his treatment, for his Atlanta came panting up with<br/>flying hair, bright eyes, ruddy cheeks, and no signs of<br/>dissatisfaction in her face.<br/><br/>"I wish I was a horse, then I could run for miles in this<br/>splendid air, and not lose my breath. It was capital, but see what<br/>a guy it's made me. Go, pick up my things, like a cherub, as you<br/>are," said Jo, dropping down under a maple tree, which was<br/>carpeting the bank with crimson leaves.<br/><br/>Laurie leisurely departed to recover the lost property, and Jo<br/>bundled up her braids, hoping no one would pass by till she was<br/>tidy again. But someone did pass, and who should it be but Meg,<br/>looking particularly ladylike in her state and festival suit, for<br/>she had been making calls.<br/>
