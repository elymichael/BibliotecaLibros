"About Meg?"

"How quickly you guessed! Yes, it's about her, and though it's a
little thing, it fidgets me."

"Beth is asleep. Speak low, and tell me all about it. That
Moffat hasn't been here, I hope?" asked Mrs. March rather
sharply.

"No. I should have shut the door in his face if he had," said
Jo, settling herself on the floor at her mother's feet. "Last
summer Meg left a pair of gloves over at the Laurences' and only
one was returned. We forgot about it, till Teddy told me that Mr.
Brooke owned that he liked Meg but didn't dare say so, she was so
young and he so poor. Now, isn't it a dreadful state of
things?"

"Do you think Meg cares for him?" asked Mrs. March, with an
anxious look.

"Mercy me! I don't know anything about love and such nonsense!"
cried Jo, with a funny mixture of interest and contempt. "In
novels, the girls show it by starting and blushing, fainting away,
growing thin, and acting like fools. Now Meg does not do anything
of the sort. She eats and drinks and sleeps like a sensible
creature, she looks straight in my face when I talk about that man,
and only blushes a little bit when Teddy jokes about lovers. I
forbid him to do it, but he doesn't mind me as he ought."

"Then you fancy that Meg is not interested in John?"

"Who?" cried Jo, staring.

"Mr. Brooke. I call him 'John' now. We fell into the way of
doing so at the hospital, and he likes it."

"Oh, dear! I know you'll take his part. He's been good to
Father, and you won't send him away, but let Meg marry him, if she
wants to. Mean thing! To go petting Papa and helping you, just to
wheedle you into liking him." And Jo pulled her hair again with a
wrathful tweak.

"My dear, don't get angry about it, and I will tell you how it
happened. John went with me at Mr. Laurence's request, and was so
devoted to poor Father that we couldn't help getting fond of him.
He was perfectly open and honorable about Meg, for he told us he
loved her, but would earn a comfortable home before he asked her to
marry him. He only wanted our leave to love her and work for her,
and the right to make her love him if he could. He is a truly
excellent young man, and we could not refuse to listen to him, but
I will not consent to Meg's engaging herself so young."
