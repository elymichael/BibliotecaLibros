"Oh, my tongue, my abominable tongue! Why can't I learn to keep
it quiet?" groaned Jo, remembering words which had been her
undoing. When she had heard the explanation of the quoted phrases,
Mrs. March said sorrowfullyâ€¦

"I wish you could have gone, but there is no hope of it this
time, so try to bear it cheerfully, and don't sadden Amy's pleasure
by reproaches or regrets."

"I'll try," said Jo, winking hard as she knelt down to pick up
the basket she had joyfully upset. "I'll take a leaf out of her
book, and try not only to seem glad, but to be so, and not grudge
her one minute of happiness. But it won't be easy, for it is a
dreadful disappointment," and poor Jo bedewed the little fat
pincushion she held with several very bitter tears.

"Jo, dear, I'm very selfish, but I couldn't spare you, and I'm
glad you are not going quite yet," whispered Beth, embracing her,
basket and all, with such a clinging touch and loving face that Jo
felt comforted in spite of the sharp regret that made her want to
box her own ears, and humbly beg Aunt Carrol to burden her with
this favor, and see how gratefully she would bear it.

By the time Amy came in, Jo was able to take her part in the
family jubilation, not quite as heartily as usual, perhaps, but
without repinings at Amy's good fortune. The young lady herself
received the news as tidings of great joy, went about in a solemn
sort of rapture, and began to sort her colors and pack her pencils
that evening, leaving such trifles as clothes, money, and passports
to those less absorbed in visions of art than herself.

"It isn't a mere pleasure trip to me, girls," she said
impressively, as she scraped her best palette. "It will decide my
career, for if I have any genius, I shall find it out in Rome, and
will do something to prove it."

"Suppose you haven't?" said Jo, sewing away, with red eyes, at
the new collars which were to be handed over to Amy.

"Then I shall come home and teach drawing for my living,"
replied the aspirant for fame, with philosophic composure. But she
made a wry face at the prospect, and scratched away at her palette
as if bent on vigorous measures before she gave up her hopes.

"No, you won't. You hate hard work, and you'll marry some rich
man, and come home to sit in the lap of luxury all your days," said
Jo.

"Your predictions sometimes come to pass, but I don't believe
that one will. I'm sure I wish it would, for if I can't be an
artist myself, I should like to be able to help those who are,"
said Amy, smiling, as if the part of Lady Bountiful would suit her
better than that of a poor drawing teacher.
