Heartache


Whatever his motive might have been, Laurie studied to some
purpose that year, for he graduated with honor, and gave the Latin
oration with the grace of a Phillips and the eloquence of a
Demosthenes, so his friends said. They were all there, his
grandfather—oh, so proud—Mr. and Mrs. March, John and Meg, Jo and
Beth, and all exulted over him with the sincere admiration which
boys make light of at the time, but fail to win from the world by
any after-triumphs.

"I've got to stay for this confounded supper, but I shall be
home early tomorrow. You'll come and meet me as usual, girls?"
Laurie said, as he put the sisters into the carriage after the joys
of the day were over. He said 'girls', but he meant Jo, for she was
the only one who kept up the old custom. She had not the heart to
refuse her splendid, successful boy anything, and answered
warmly…

"I'll come, Teddy, rain or shine, and march before you, playing
'Hail the conquering hero comes' on a jew's-harp."

Laurie thanked her with a look that made her think in a sudden
panic, "Oh, deary me! I know he'll say something, and then what
shall I do?"

Evening meditation and morning work somewhat allayed her fears,
and having decided that she wouldn't be vain enough to think people
were going to propose when she had given them every reason to know
what her answer would be, she set forth at the appointed time,
hoping Teddy wouldn't do anything to make her hurt his poor
feelings. A call at Meg's, and a refreshing sniff and sip at the
Daisy and Demijohn, still further fortified her for the
tete-a-tete, but when she saw a stalwart figure looming in the
distance, she had a strong desire to turn about and run away.

"Where's the jew's-harp, Jo?" cried Laurie, as soon as he was
within speaking distance.

"I forgot it." And Jo took heart again, for that salutation
could not be called lover-like.
