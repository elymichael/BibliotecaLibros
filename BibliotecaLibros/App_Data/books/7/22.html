<br/>"Mother did it." And Meg smiled her sweetest, in spite of her<br/>gray beard and white eyebrows.<br/><br/>"Aunt March had a good fit and sent the supper," cried Jo, with<br/>a sudden inspiration.<br/><br/>"All wrong. Old Mr. Laurence sent it," replied Mrs. March.<br/><br/>"The Laurence boy's grandfather! What in the world put such a<br/>thing into his head? We don't know him!" exclaimed Meg.<br/><br/>"Hannah told one of his servants about your breakfast party. He<br/>is an odd old gentleman, but that pleased him. He knew my father<br/>years ago, and he sent me a polite note this afternoon, saying he<br/>hoped I would allow him to express his friendly feeling toward my<br/>children by sending them a few trifles in honor of the day. I could<br/>not refuse, and so you have a little feast at night to make up for<br/>the bread-and-milk breakfast."<br/><br/>"That boy put it into his head, I know he did! He's a capital<br/>fellow, and I wish we could get acquainted. He looks as if he'd<br/>like to know us but he's bashful, and Meg is so prim she won't let<br/>me speak to him when we pass," said Jo, as the plates went round,<br/>and the ice began to melt out of sight, with ohs and ahs of<br/>satisfaction.<br/><br/>"You mean the people who live in the big house next door, don't<br/>you?" asked one of the girls. "My mother knows old Mr. Laurence,<br/>but says he's very proud and doesn't like to mix with his<br/>neighbors. He keeps his grandson shut up, when he isn't riding or<br/>walking with his tutor, and makes him study very hard. We invited<br/>him to our party, but he didn't come. Mother says he's very nice,<br/>though he never speaks to us girls."<br/><br/>"Our cat ran away once, and he brought her back, and we talked<br/>over the fence, and were getting on capitally, all about cricket,<br/>and so on, when he saw Meg coming, and walked off. I mean to know<br/>him some day, for he needs fun, I'm sure he does," said Jo<br/>decidedly.<br/><br/>"I like his manners, and he looks like a little gentleman, so<br/>I've no objection to your knowing him, if a proper opportunity<br/>comes. He brought the flowers himself, and I should have asked him<br/>in, if I had been sure what was going on upstairs. He looked so<br/>wistful as he went away, hearing the frolic and evidently having<br/>none of his own."<br/><br/>"It's a mercy you didn't, Mother!" laughed Jo, looking at her<br/>boots. "But we'll have another play sometime that he can see.<br/>Perhaps he'll help act. Wouldn't that be jolly?"<br/><br/>
