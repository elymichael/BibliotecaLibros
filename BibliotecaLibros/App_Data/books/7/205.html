<br/>"Of course not. It would be idiotic! I knew there was mischief<br/>brewing. I felt it, and now it's worse than I imagined. I just wish<br/>I could marry Meg myself, and keep her safe in the family."<br/><br/>This odd arrangement made Mrs. March smile, but she said<br/>gravely, "Jo, I confide in you and don't wish you to say anything<br/>to Meg yet. When John comes back, and I see them together, I can<br/>judge better of her feelings toward him."<br/><br/>"She'll see those handsome eyes that she talks about, and then<br/>it will be all up with her. She's got such a soft heart, it will<br/>melt like butter in the sun if anyone looks sentimentlly at her.<br/>She read the short reports he sent more than she did your letters,<br/>and pinched me when I spoke of it, and likes brown eyes, and<br/>doesn't think John an ugly name, and she'll go and fall in love,<br/>and there's an end of peace and fun, and cozy times together. I see<br/>it all! They'll go lovering around the house, and we shall have to<br/>dodge. Meg will be absorbed and no good to me any more. Brooke will<br/>scratch up a fortune somehow, carry her off, and make a hole in the<br/>family, and I shall break my heart, and everything will be<br/>abominably uncomfortable. Oh, dear me! Why weren't we all boys,<br/>then there wouldn't be any bother."<br/><br/>Jo leaned her chin on her knees in a disconsolate attitude and<br/>shook her fist at the reprehensible John. Mrs. March sighed, and Jo<br/>looked up with an air of relief.<br/><br/>"You don't like it, Mother? I'm glad of it. Let's send him about<br/>his business, and not tell Meg a word of it, but all be happy<br/>together as we always have been."<br/><br/>"I did wrong to sigh, Jo. It is natural and right you should all<br/>go to homes of your own in time, but I do want to keep my girls as<br/>long as I can, and I am sorry that this happened so soon, for Meg<br/>is only seventeen and it will be some years before John can make a<br/>home for her. Your father and I have agreed that she shall not bind<br/>herself in any way, nor be married, before twenty. If she and John<br/>love one another, they can wait, and test the love by doing so. She<br/>is conscientious, and I have no fear of her treating him unkindly.<br/>My pretty, tender hearted girl! I hope things will go happily with<br/>her."<br/><br/>"Hadn't you rather have her marry a rich man?" asked Jo, as her<br/>mother's voice faltered a little over the last words.<br/><br/>"Money is a good and useful thing, Jo, and I hope my girls will<br/>never feel the need of it too bitterly, nor be tempted by too much.<br/>I should like to know that John was firmly established in some good<br/>business, which gave him an income large enough to keep free from<br/>debt and make Meg comfortable. I'm not ambitious for a splendid<br/>fortune, a fashionable position, or a great name for my girls. If<br/>rank and money come with love and virtue, also, I should accept<br/>them gratefully, and enjoy your good fortune, but I know, by<br/>experience, how much genuine happiness can be had in a plain little<br/>house, where the daily bread is earned, and some privations give<br/>sweetness to the few pleasures. I am content to see Meg begin<br/>humbly, for if I am not mistaken, she will be rich in the<br/>possession of a good man's heart, and that is better than a<br/>fortune."<br/><br/>"I understand, Mother, and quite agree, but I'm disappointed<br/>about Meg, for I'd planned to have her marry Teddy by-and-by and<br/>sit in the lap of luxury all her days. Wouldn't it be nice?" asked<br/>Jo, looking up with a brighter face.<br/><br/>"He is younger than she, you know," began Mrs. March, but Jo<br/>broke inâ€¦<br/><br/>
