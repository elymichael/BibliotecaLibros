Now Mr. Davis had declared limes a contraband article, and<br/>solemnly vowed to publicly ferrule the first person who was found<br/>breaking the law. This much-enduring man had succeeded in banishing<br/>chewing gum after a long and stormy war, had made a bonfire of the<br/>confiscated novels and newspapers, had suppressed a private post<br/>office, had forbidden distortions of the face, nicknames, and<br/>caricatures, and done all that one man could do to keep half a<br/>hundred rebellious girls in order. Boys are trying enough to human<br/>patience, goodness knows, but girls are infinitely more so,<br/>especially to nervous gentlemen with tyrannical tempers and no more<br/>talent for teaching than Dr. Blimber. Mr. Davis knew any quantity<br/>of Greek, Latin, algebra, and ologies of all sorts so he was called<br/>a fine teacher, and manners, morals, feelings, and examples were<br/>not considered of any particular importance. It was a most<br/>unfortunate moment for denouncing Amy, and Jenny knew it. Mr. Davis<br/>had evidently taken his coffee too strong that morning, there was<br/>an east wind, which always affected his neuralgia, and his pupils<br/>had not done him the credit which he felt he deserved. Therefore,<br/>to use the expressive, if not elegant, language of a schoolgirl,<br/>"He was as nervous as a witch and as cross as a bear". The word<br/>'limes' was like fire to powder, his yellow face flushed, and he<br/>rapped on his desk with an energy which made Jenny skip to her seat<br/>with unusual rapidity.<br/><br/>"Young ladies, attention, if you please!"<br/><br/>At the stern order the buzz ceased, and fifty pairs of blue,<br/>black, gray, and brown eyes were obediently fixed upon his awful<br/>countenance.<br/><br/>"Miss March, come to the desk."<br/><br/>Amy rose to comply with outward composure, but a secret fear<br/>oppressed her, for the limes weighed upon her conscience.<br/><br/>"Bring with you the limes you have in your desk," was the<br/>unexpected command which arrested her before she got out of her<br/>seat.<br/><br/>"Don't take all." whispered her neighbor, a young lady of great<br/>presence of mind.<br/><br/>Amy hastily shook out half a dozen and laid the rest down before<br/>Mr. Davis, feeling that any man possessing a human heart would<br/>relent when that delicious perfume met his nose. Unfortunately, Mr.<br/>Davis particularly detested the odor of the fashionable pickle, and<br/>disgust added to his wrath.<br/><br/>"Is that all?"<br/><br/>"Not quite," stammered Amy.<br/><br/>"Bring the rest immediately."<br/>
