"I know it. I'll tell you by-and-by."

"Is the pain better now?"

"Oh, yes, much better, you are so comfortable, Jo."

"Go to sleep, dear. I'll stay with you."

So cheek to cheek they fell asleep, and on the morrow Beth
seemed quite herself again, for at eighteen neither heads nor
hearts ache long, and a loving word can medicine most ills.

But Jo had made up her mind, and after pondering over a project
for some days, she confided it to her mother.

"You asked me the other day what my wishes were. I'll tell you
one of them, Marmee," she began, as they sat along together. "I
want to go away somewhere this winter for a change."

"Why, Jo?" and her mother looked up quickly, as if the words
suggested a double meaning.

With her eyes on her work Jo answered soberly, "I want something
new. I feel restless and anxious to be seeing, doing, and learning
more than I am. I brood too much over my own small affairs, and
need stirring up, so as I can be spared this winter, I'd like to
hop a little way and try my wings."

"Where will you hop?"

"To New York. I had a bright idea yesterday, and this is it. You
know Mrs. Kirke wrote to you for some respectable young person to
teach her children and sew. It's rather hard to find just the
thing, but I think I should suit if I tried."
