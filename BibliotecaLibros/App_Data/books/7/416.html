"And what did you there?"<br/><br/>"I kissed her," began Demi, with artless frankness.<br/><br/>"Prut! Thou beginnest early. What did the little Mary say to<br/>that?" asked Mr. Bhaer, continuing to confess the young sinner, who<br/>stood upon the knee, exploring the waistcoat pocket.<br/><br/>"Oh, she liked it, and she kissed me, and I liked it. Don't<br/>little boys like little girls?" asked Demi, with his mouth full,<br/>and an air of bland satisfaction.<br/><br/>"You precocious chick! Who put that into your head?" said Jo,<br/>enjoying the innocent revelation as much as the Professor.<br/><br/>"'Tisn't in mine head, it's in mine mouf," answered literal<br/>Demi, putting out his tongue, with a chocolate drop on it, thinking<br/>she alluded to confectionery, not ideas.<br/><br/>"Thou shouldst save some for the little friend. Sweets to the<br/>sweet, mannling," and Mr. Bhaer offered Jo some, with a look that<br/>made her wonder if chocolate was not the nectar drunk by the gods.<br/>Demi also saw the smile, was impressed by it, and artlessy<br/>inquiredâ€¦<br/><br/>"Do great boys like great girls, to, 'Fessor?"<br/><br/>Like young Washington, Mr. Bhaer 'couldn't tell a lie', so he<br/>gave the somewhat vague reply that he believed they did sometimes,<br/>in a tone that made Mr. March put down his clothesbrush, glance at<br/>Jo's retiring face, and then sink into his chair, looking as if the<br/>'precocious chick' had put an idea into his head that was both<br/>sweet and sour.<br/><br/>Why Dodo, when she caught him in the china closet half an hour<br/>afterward, nearly squeezed the breath out of his little body with a<br/>tender embrace, instead of shaking him for being there, and why she<br/>followed up this novel performance by the unexpected gift of a big<br/>slice of bread and jelly, remained one of the problems over which<br/>Demi puzzled his small wits, and was forced to leave unsolved<br/>forever.<br/><br/><br/>
