"Talk to me, please. It's dull, sitting by myself," answered<br/>Frank, who had evidently been used to being made much of at<br/>home.<br/><br/>If he asked her to deliver a Latin oration, it would not have<br/>seemed a more impossible task to bashful Beth, but there was no<br/>place to run to, no Jo to hide behind now, and the poor boy looked<br/>so wistfully at her that she bravely resolved to try.<br/><br/>"What do you like to talk about?" she asked, fumbling over the<br/>cards and dropping half as she tried to tie them up.<br/><br/>"Well, I like to hear about cricket and boating and hunting,"<br/>said Frank, who had not yet learned to suit his amusements to his<br/>strength.<br/><br/>My heart! What shall I do? I don't know anything about them,<br/>thought Beth, and forgetting the boy's misfortune in her flurry,<br/>she said, hoping to make him talk, "I never saw any hunting, but I<br/>suppose you know all about it."<br/><br/>"I did once, but I can never hunt again, for I got hurt leaping<br/>a confounded five-barred gate, so there are no more horses and<br/>hounds for me," said Frank with a sigh that made Beth hate herself<br/>for her innocent blunder.<br/><br/>"Your deer are much prettier than our ugly buffaloes," she said,<br/>turning to the prairies for help and feeling glad that she had read<br/>one of the boys' books in which Jo delighted.<br/><br/>Buffaloes proved soothing and satisfactory, and in her eagerness<br/>to amuse another, Beth forgot herself, and was quite unconscious of<br/>her sisters' surprise and delight at the unusual spectacle of Beth<br/>talking away to one of the dreadful boys, against whom she had<br/>begged protection.<br/><br/>"Bless her heart! She pities him, so she is good to him," said<br/>Jo, beaming at her from the croquet ground.<br/><br/>"I always said she was a little saint," added Meg, as if there<br/>could be no further doubt of it.<br/><br/>"I haven't heard Frank laugh so much for ever so long," said<br/>Grace to Amy, as they sat discussing dolls and making tea sets out<br/>of the acorn cups.<br/>
