"So we are to countenance things and people which we detest,
merely because we are not belles and millionaires, are we? That's a
nice sort of morality."

"I can't argue about it, I only know that it's the way of the
world, and people who set themselves against it only get laughed at
for their pains. I don't like reformers, and I hope you never try
to be one."

"I do like them, and I shall be one if I can, for in spite of
the laughing the world would never get on without them. We can't
agree about that, for you belong to the old set, and I to the new.
You will get on the best, but I shall have the liveliest time of
it. I should rather enjoy the brickbats and hooting, I think."

"Well, compose yourself now, and don't worry Aunt with your new
ideas."

"I'll try not to, but I'm always possessed to burst out with
some particularly blunt speech or revolutionary sentiment before
her. It's my doom, and I can't help it."

They found Aunt Carrol with the old lady, both absorbed in some
very interesting subject, but they dropped it as the girls came in,
with a conscious look which betrayed that they had been talking
about their nieces. Jo was not in a good humor, and the perverse
fit returned, but Amy, who had virtuously done her duty, kept her
temper and pleased everybody, was in a most angelic frame of mind.
This amiable spirit was felt at once, and both aunts 'my deared'
her affectionately, looking what they afterward said emphatically,
"That child improves every day."

"Are you going to help about the fair, dear?" asked Mrs. Carrol,
as Amy sat down beside her with the confiding air elderly people
like so well in the young.

"Yes, Aunt. Mrs. Chester asked me if I would, and I offered to
tend a table, as I have nothing but my time to give."

"I'm not," put in Jo decidedly. "I hate to be patronized, and
the Chesters think it's a great favor to allow us to help with
their highly connected fair. I wonder you consented, Amy, they only
want you to work."

"I am willing to work. It's for the freedmen as well as the
Chesters, and I think it very kind of them to let me share the
labor and the fun. Patronage does not trouble me when it is well
meant."
