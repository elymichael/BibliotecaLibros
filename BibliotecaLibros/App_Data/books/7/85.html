"Daisy, dear, I've sent an invitation to your friend, Mr.<br/>Laurence, for Thursday. We should like to know him, and it's only a<br/>proper compliment to you."<br/><br/>Meg colored, but a mischievous fancy to tease the girls made her<br/>reply demurely, "You are very kind, but I'm afraid he won't<br/>come."<br/><br/>"Why not, Cherie?" asked Miss Belle.<br/><br/>"He's too old."<br/><br/>"My child, what do you mean? What is his age, I beg to know!"<br/>cried Miss Clara.<br/><br/>"Nearly seventy, I believe," answered Meg, counting stitches to<br/>hide the merriment in her eyes.<br/><br/>"You sly creature! Of course we meant the young man," exclaimed<br/>Miss Belle, laughing.<br/><br/>"There isn't any, Laurie is only a little boy." And Meg laughed<br/>also at the queer look which the sisters exchanged as she thus<br/>described her supposed lover.<br/><br/>"About your age," Nan said.<br/><br/>"Nearer my sister Jo's; I am seventeen in August," returned Meg,<br/>tossing her head.<br/><br/>"It's very nice of him to send you flowers, isn't it?" said<br/>Annie, looking wise about nothing.<br/>
