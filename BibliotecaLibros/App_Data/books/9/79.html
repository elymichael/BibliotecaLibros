The spirit of adventure rose in the boys' souls once more.<br/><br/>"Hucky, do you das't to go if I lead?"<br/><br/>"I don't like to, much. Tom, s'pose it's Injun Joe!"<br/><br/>Tom quailed. But presently the temptation rose up strong again<br/>and the boys agreed to try, with the understanding that they would<br/>take to their heels if the snoring stopped. So they went tiptoeing<br/>stealthily down, the one behind the other. When they had got to<br/>within five steps of the snorer, Tom stepped on a stick, and it<br/>broke with a sharp snap. The man moaned, writhed a little, and his<br/>face came into the moonlight. It was Muff Potter. The boys' hearts<br/>had stood still, and their hopes too, when the man moved, but their<br/>fears passed away now. They tiptoed out, through the broken<br/>weather-boarding, and stopped at a little distance to exchange a<br/>parting word. That long, lugubrious howl rose on the night air<br/>again! They turned and saw the strange dog standing within a few<br/>feet of where Potter was lying, and facing Potter, with his nose<br/>pointing heavenward.<br/><br/>"Oh, geeminy, it's him!" exclaimed both boys, in a breath.<br/><br/>"Say, Tom — they say a stray dog come howling around Johnny<br/>Miller's house, 'bout midnight, as much as two weeks ago; and a<br/>whippoorwill come in and lit on the banisters and sung, the very<br/>same evening; and there ain't anybody dead there yet."<br/><br/>"Well, I know that. And suppose there ain't. Didn't Gracie<br/>Miller fall in the kitchen fire and burn herself terrible the very<br/>next Saturday?"<br/><br/>"Yes, but she ain't dead. And what's more, she's getting better,<br/>too."<br/><br/>"All right, you wait and see. She's a goner, just as dead sure<br/>as Muff Potter's a goner. That's what the niggers say, and they<br/>know all about these kind of things, Huck."<br/><br/>Then they separated, cogitating. When Tom crept in at his<br/>bedroom window the night was almost spent. He undressed with<br/>excessive caution, and fell asleep congratulating himself that<br/>nobody knew of his escapade. He was not aware that the<br/>gently-snoring Sid was awake, and had been so for an hour.<br/><br/>When Tom awoke, Sid was dressed and gone. There was a late look<br/>in the light, a late sense in the atmosphere. He was startled. Why<br/>had he not been called — persecuted till he was up, as usual? The<br/>thought filled him with bodings. Within five minutes he was dressed<br/>and down-stairs, feeling sore and drowsy. The family were still at<br/>table, but they had finished breakfast. There was no voice of<br/>rebuke; but there were averted eyes; there was a silence and an air<br/>of solemnity that struck a chill to the culprit's heart. He sat<br/>down and tried to seem gay, but it was up-hill work; it roused no<br/>smile, no response, and he lapsed into silence and let his heart<br/>sink down to the depths.<br/>
