<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>2<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>Saturday morning was come, and all the summer world was bright<br/>and fresh, and brimming with life. There was a song in every heart;<br/>and if the heart was young the music issued at the lips. There was<br/>cheer in every face and a spring in every step. The locust-trees<br/>were in bloom and the fragrance of the blossoms filled the air.<br/>Cardiff Hill, beyond the village and above it, was green with<br/>vegetation and it lay just far enough away to seem a Delectable<br/>Land, dreamy, reposeful, and inviting.<br/><br/>Tom appeared on the sidewalk with a bucket of whitewash and a<br/>long-handled brush. He surveyed the fence, and all gladness left<br/>him and a deep melancholy settled down upon his spirit. Thirty<br/>yards of board fence nine feet high. Life to him seemed hollow, and<br/>existence but a burden. Sighing, he dipped his brush and passed it<br/>along the topmost plank; repeated the operation; did it again;<br/>compared the insignificant whitewashed streak with the far-reaching<br/>continent of unwhitewashed fence, and sat down on a tree-box<br/>discouraged. Jim came skipping out at the gate with a tin pail, and<br/>singing Buffalo Gals. Bringing water from the town pump had always<br/>been hateful work in Tom's eyes, before, but now it did not strike<br/>him so. He remembered that there was company at the pump. White,<br/>mulatto, and negro boys and girls were always there waiting their<br/>turns, resting, trading playthings, quarrelling, fighting,<br/>skylarking. And he remembered that although the pump was only a<br/>hundred and fifty yards off, Jim never got back with a bucket of<br/>water under an hour — and even then somebody generally had to go<br/>after him. Tom said:<br/><br/>"Say, Jim, I'll fetch the water if you'll whitewash some."<br/><br/>Jim shook his head and said:<br/><br/>"Can't, Mars Tom. Ole missis, she tole me I got to go an' git<br/>dis water an' not stop foolin' roun' wid anybody. She say she spec'<br/>Mars Tom gwine to ax me to whitewash, an' so she tole me go 'long<br/>an' 'tend to my own business — she 'lowed she'd 'tend to de<br/>whitewashin'."<br/><br/>"Oh, never you mind what she said, Jim. That's the way she<br/>always talks. Gimme the bucket — I won't be gone only a a minute.<br/>She won't ever know."<br/><br/>
