"Oh, you don't want to see!"

"Now that you treat me so, I will see." And she put her small
hand upon his and a little scuffle ensued, Tom pretending to resist
in earnest but letting his hand slip by degrees till these words
were revealed: "I love You."

"Oh, you bad thing!" And she hit his hand a smart rap, but
reddened and looked pleased, nevertheless.

Just at this juncture the boy felt a slow, fateful grip closing
on his ear, and a steady lifting impulse. In that vise he was borne
across the house and deposited in his own seat, under a peppering
fire of giggles from the whole school. Then the master stood over
him during a few awful moments, and finally moved away to his
throne without saying a word. But although Tom's ear tingled, his
heart was jubilant.

As the school quieted down Tom made an honest effort to study,
but the turmoil within him was too great. In turn he took his place
in the reading class and made a botch of it; then in the geography
class and turned lakes into mountains, mountains into rivers, and
rivers into continents, till chaos was come again; then in the
spelling class, and got "turned down," by a succession of mere baby
words, till he brought up at the foot and yielded up the pewter
medal which he had worn with ostentation for months.
