<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>30<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>As the earliest suspicion of dawn appeared on Sunday morning,<br/>Huck came groping up the hill and rapped gently at the old<br/>Welshman's door. The inmates were asleep, but it was a sleep that<br/>was set on a hair-trigger, on account of the exciting episode of<br/>the night. A call came from a window: "Who's there!"<br/><br/>Huck's scared voice answered in a low tone:<br/><br/>"Please let me in! It's only Huck Finn!"<br/><br/>"It's a name that can open this door night or day, lad! — and<br/>welcome!"<br/><br/>These were strange words to the vagabond boy's ears, and the<br/>pleasantest he had ever heard. He could not recollect that the<br/>closing word had ever been applied in his case before. The door was<br/>quickly unlocked, and he entered. Huck was given a seat and the old<br/>man and his brace of tall sons speedily dressed themselves.<br/><br/>"Now, my boy, I hope you're good and hungry, because breakfast<br/>will be ready as soon as the sun's up, and we'll have a piping hot<br/>one, too — make yourself easy about that! I and the boys hoped<br/>you'd turn up and stop here last night."<br/><br/>
