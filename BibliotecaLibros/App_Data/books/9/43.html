"Yes. Least I reckon so."<br/><br/>"Did he say anything?"<br/><br/>"I don't reckon he did. I don't know."<br/><br/>"Aha! Talk about trying to cure warts with spunk-water such a<br/>blame fool way as that! Why, that ain't a-going to do any good. You<br/>got to go all by yourself, to the middle of the woods, where you<br/>know there's a spunk-water stump, and just as it's midnight you<br/>back up against the stump and jam your hand in and say:<br/><br/>'Barley-corn, barley-corn, injun-meal shorts,<br/><br/>Spunk-water, spunk-water, swaller these warts,'<br/><br/>and then walk away quick, eleven steps, with your eyes shut, and<br/>then turn around three times and walk home without speaking to<br/>anybody. Because if you speak the charm's busted." "Well, that<br/>sounds like a good way; but that ain't the way Bob Tanner<br/>done."<br/><br/>"No, sir, you can bet he didn't, becuz he's the wartiest boy in<br/>this town; and he wouldn't have a wart on him if he'd knowed how to<br/>work spunk-water. I've took off thousands of warts off of my hands<br/>that way, Huck. I play with frogs so much that I've always got<br/>considerable many warts. Sometimes I take 'em off with a bean."<br/><br/>"Yes, bean's good. I've done that."<br/><br/>"Have you? What's your way?"<br/><br/>"You take and split the bean, and cut the wart so as to get some<br/>blood, and then you put the blood on one piece of the bean and take<br/>and dig a hole and bury it 'bout midnight at the crossroads in the<br/>dark of the moon, and then you burn up the rest of the bean. You<br/>see that piece that's got the blood on it will keep drawing and<br/>drawing, trying to fetch the other piece to it, and so that helps<br/>the blood to draw the wart, and pretty soon off she comes."<br/>
