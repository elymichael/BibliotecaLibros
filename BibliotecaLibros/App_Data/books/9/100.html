Tom withered him with derision! Huck, being uncommitted as yet,<br/>joined in with Tom, and the waverer quickly "explained," and was<br/>glad to get out of the scrape with as little taint of<br/>chicken-hearted homesickness clinging to his garments as he could.<br/>Mutiny was effectually laid to rest for the moment.<br/><br/>As the night deepened, Huck began to nod, and presently to<br/>snore. Joe followed next. Tom lay upon his elbow motionless, for<br/>some time, watching the two intently. At last he got up cautiously,<br/>on his knees, and went searching among the grass and the flickering<br/>reflections flung by the camp-fire. He picked up and inspected<br/>several large semi-cylinders of the thin white bark of a sycamore,<br/>and finally chose two which seemed to suit him. Then he knelt by<br/>the fire and painfully wrote something upon each of these with his<br/>"red keel"; one he rolled up and put in his jacket pocket, and the<br/>other he put in Joe's hat and removed it to a little distance from<br/>the owner. And he also put into the hat certain schoolboy treasures<br/>of almost inestimable value â€” among them a lump of chalk, an<br/>India-rubber ball, three fishhooks, and one of that kind of marbles<br/>known as a "sure 'nough crystal." Then he tiptoed his way<br/>cautiously among the trees till he felt that he was out of hearing,<br/>and straightway broke into a keen run in the direction of the<br/>sandbar.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
