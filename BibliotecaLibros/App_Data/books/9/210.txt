Huck said: "Tom, we can slope, if we can find a rope. The window
ain't high from the ground." "Shucks! what do you want to slope
for?"

"Well, I ain't used to that kind of a crowd. I can't stand it. I
ain't going down there, Tom."

"Oh, bother! It ain't anything. I don't mind it a bit. I'll take
care of you."

Sid appeared.

"Tom," said he, "auntie has been waiting for you all the
afternoon. Mary got your Sunday clothes ready, and everybody's been
fretting about you. Say â€” ain't this grease and clay, on your
clothes?"

"Now, Mr. Siddy, you jist 'tend to your own business. What's all
this blow-out about, anyway?"
