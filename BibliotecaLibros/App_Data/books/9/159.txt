"Any fool knows that. I don't reckon you was the first that
found it out, Huck."

"Well, I never said I was, did I? And Friday ain't all, neither.
I had a rotten bad dream last night — dreampt about rats."

"No! Sure sign of trouble. Did they fight?"

"No."

"Well, that's good, Huck. When they don't fight it's only a sign
that there's trouble around, you know. All we got to do is to look
mighty sharp and keep out of it. We'll drop this thing for to-day,
and play. Do you know Robin Hood, Huck?"

"No. Who's Robin Hood?"

"Why, he was one of the greatest men that was ever in England —
and the best. He was a robber."

"Cracky, I wisht I was. Who did he rob?"

"Only sheriffs and bishops and rich people and kings, and such
like. But he never bothered the poor. He loved 'em. He always
divided up with 'em perfectly square."

"Well, he must 'a' been a brick."

"I bet you he was, Huck. Oh, he was the noblest man that ever
was. They ain't any such men now, I can tell you. He could lick any
man in England, with one hand tied behind him; and he could take
his yew bow and plug a ten-cent piece every time, a mile and a
half."
