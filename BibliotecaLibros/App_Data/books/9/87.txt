But Peter signified that he did want it.

"You better make sure."

Peter was sure.

"Now you've asked for it, and I'll give it to you, because there
ain't anything mean about me; but if you find you don't like it,
you mustn't blame anybody but your own self."

Peter was agreeable. So Tom pried his mouth open and poured down
the Pain-killer. Peter sprang a couple of yards in the air, and
then delivered a war-whoop and set off round and round the room,
banging against furniture, upsetting flower-pots, and making
general havoc. Next he rose on his hind feet and pranced around, in
a frenzy of enjoyment, with his head over his shoulder and his
voice proclaiming his unappeasable happiness. Then he went tearing
around the house again spreading chaos and destruction in his path.
Aunt Polly entered in time to see him throw a few double
summersets, deliver a final mighty hurrah, and sail through the
open window, carrying the rest of the flower-pots with him. The old
lady stood petrified with astonishment, peering over her glasses;
Tom lay on the floor expiring with laughter.

"Tom, what on earth ails that cat?"

"I don't know, aunt," gasped the boy.

"Why, I never see anything like it. What did make him act
so?"

"Deed I don't know, Aunt Polly; cats always act so when they're
having a good time."

"They do, do they?" There was something in the tone that made
Tom apprehensive.

"Yes'm. That is, I believe they do."
