"Well, everybody does that way, Huck."<br/><br/>"Tom, it don't make no difference. I ain't everybody, and I<br/>can't stand it. It's awful to be tied up so. And grub comes too<br/>easy — I don't take no interest in vittles, that way. I got to ask<br/>to go a-fishing; I got to ask to go in a-swimming — dern'd if I<br/>hain't got to ask to do everything. Well, I'd got to talk so nice<br/>it wasn't no comfort — I'd got to go up in the attic and rip out<br/>awhile, every day, to git a taste in my mouth, or I'd a died, Tom.<br/>The widder wouldn't let me smoke; she wouldn't let me yell, she<br/>wouldn't let me gape, nor stretch, nor scratch, before folks —"<br/>[Then with a spasm of special irritation and injury] — "And dad<br/>fetch it, she prayed all the time! I never see such a woman! I had<br/>to shove, Tom — I just had to. And besides, that school's going to<br/>open, and I'd a had to go to it — well, I wouldn't stand that, Tom.<br/>Looky-here, Tom, being rich ain't what it's cracked up to be. It's<br/>just worry and worry, and sweat and sweat, and a-wishing you was<br/>dead all the time. Now these clothes suits me, and this bar'l suits<br/>me, and I ain't ever going to shake 'em any more. Tom, I wouldn't<br/>ever got into all this trouble if it hadn't 'a' ben for that money;<br/>now you just take my sheer of it along with your'n, and gimme a<br/>ten-center sometimes — not many times, becuz I don't give a dern<br/>for a thing 'thout it's tollable hard to git — and you go and beg<br/>off for me with the widder."<br/><br/>"Oh, Huck, you know I can't do that. 'Tain't fair; and besides<br/>if you'll try this thing just a while longer you'll come to like<br/>it."<br/><br/>"Like it! Yes — the way I'd like a hot stove if I was to set on<br/>it long enough. No, Tom, I won't be rich, and I won't live in them<br/>cussed smothery houses. I like the woods, and the river, and<br/>hogsheads, and I'll stick to 'em, too. Blame it all! just as we'd<br/>got guns, and a cave, and all just fixed to rob, here this dern<br/>foolishness has got to come up and spile it all!"<br/><br/>Tom saw his opportunity —<br/><br/>"Lookyhere, Huck, being rich ain't going to keep me back from<br/>turning robber."<br/><br/>"No! Oh, good-licks; are you in real dead-wood earnest,<br/>Tom?"<br/><br/>"Just as dead earnest as I'm sitting here. But Huck, we can't<br/>let you into the gang if you ain't respectable, you know."<br/><br/>Huck's joy was quenched.<br/><br/>"Can't let me in, Tom? Didn't you let me go for a pirate?"<br/><br/>"Yes, but that's different. A robber is more high-toned than<br/>what a pirate is — as a general thing. In most countries they're<br/>awful high up in the nobility — dukes and such."<br/>
