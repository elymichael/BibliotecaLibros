<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>22<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>Tom joined the new order of Cadets of Temperance, being<br/>attracted by the showy character of their "regalia." He promised to<br/>abstain from smoking, chewing, and profanity as long as he remained<br/>a member. Now he found out a new thing — namely, that to promise<br/>not to do a thing is the surest way in the world to make a body<br/>want to go and do that very thing. Tom soon found himself tormented<br/>with a desire to drink and swear; the desire grew to be so intense<br/>that nothing but the hope of a chance to display himself in his red<br/>sash kept him from withdrawing from the order. Fourth of July was<br/>coming; but he soon gave that up — gave it up before he had worn<br/>his shackles over forty-eight hours — and fixed his hopes upon old<br/>Judge Frazer, justice of the peace, who was apparently on his<br/>deathbed and would have a big public funeral, since he was so high<br/>an official. During three days Tom was deeply concerned about the<br/>Judge's condition and hungry for news of it. Sometimes his hopes<br/>ran high — so high that he would venture to get out his regalia and<br/>practise before the looking-glass. But the Judge had a most<br/>discouraging way of fluctuating. At last he was pronounced upon the<br/>mend — and then convalescent. Tom was disgusted; and felt a sense<br/>of injury, too. He handed in his resignation at once — and that<br/>night the Judge suffered a relapse and died. Tom resolved that he<br/>would never trust a man like that again. The funeral was a fine<br/>thing. The Cadets paraded in a style calculated to kill the late<br/>member with envy. Tom was a free boy again, however — there was<br/>something in that. He could drink and swear, now — but found to his<br/>surprise that he did not want to. The simple fact that he could,<br/>took the desire away, and the charm of it.<br/><br/>Tom presently wondered to find that his coveted vacation was<br/>beginning to hang a little heavily on his hands.<br/><br/>He attempted a diary — but nothing happened during three days,<br/>and so he abandoned it.<br/><br/>The first of all the negro minstrel shows came to town, and made<br/>a sensation. Tom and Joe Harper got up a band of performers and<br/>were happy for two days.<br/><br/>Even the Glorious Fourth was in some sense a failure, for it<br/>rained hard, there was no procession in consequence, and the<br/>greatest man in the world (as Tom supposed), Mr. Benton, an actual<br/>United States Senator, proved an overwhelming disappointment — for<br/>he was not twenty-five feet high, nor even anywhere in the<br/>neighborhood of it.<br/><br/>A circus came. The boys played circus for three days afterward<br/>in tents made of rag carpeting — admission, three pins for boys,<br/>two for girls — and then circusing was abandoned.<br/><br/>
