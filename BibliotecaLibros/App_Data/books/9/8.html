<br/>"Well, I know. It's jam — that's what it is. Forty times I've<br/>said if you didn't let that jam alone I'd skin you. Hand me that<br/>switch."<br/><br/>The switch hovered in the air — the peril was desperate —<br/><br/>"My! Look behind you, aunt!"<br/><br/>The old lady whirled round, and snatched her skirts out of<br/>danger. The lad fled on the instant, scrambled up the high<br/>board-fence, and disappeared over it.<br/><br/>His aunt Polly stood surprised a moment, and then broke into a<br/>gentle laugh.<br/><br/>"Hang the boy, can't I never learn anything? Ain't he played me<br/>tricks enough like that for me to be looking out for him by this<br/>time? But old fools is the biggest fools there is. Can't learn an<br/>old dog new tricks, as the saying is. But my goodness, he never<br/>plays them alike, two days, and how is a body to know what's<br/>coming? He 'pears to know just how long he can torment me before I<br/>get my dander up, and he knows if he can make out to put me off for<br/>a minute or make me laugh, it's all down again and I can't hit him<br/>a lick. I ain't doing my duty by that boy, and that's the Lord's<br/>truth, goodness knows. Spare the rod and spoil the child, as the<br/>Good Book says. I'm a laying up sin and suffering for us both, I<br/>know. He's full of the Old Scratch, but laws-a-me! he's my own dead<br/>sister's boy, poor thing, and I ain't got the heart to lash him,<br/>somehow. Every time I let him off, my conscience does hurt me so,<br/>and every time I hit him my old heart most breaks. Well-a-well, man<br/>that is born of woman is of few days and full of trouble, as the<br/>Scripture says, and I reckon it's so. He'll play hookey this<br/>evening [*], and I'll just be obliged to make him work, to-morrow,<br/>to punish him. It's mighty hard to make him work Saturdays, when<br/>all the boys is having holiday, but he hates work more than he<br/>hates anything else, and I've got to do some of my duty by him, or<br/>I'll be the ruination of the child."<br/><br/>Tom did play hookey, and he had a very good time. He got back<br/>home barely in season to help Jim, the small colored boy, saw<br/>next-day's wood and split the kindlings before supper — at least he<br/>was there in time to tell his adventures to Jim while Jim did<br/>three-fourths of the work. Tom's younger brother (or rather<br/>half-brother) Sid was already through with his part of the work<br/>(picking up chips), for he was a quiet boy, and had no adventurous,<br/>troublesome ways.<br/><br/>While Tom was eating his supper, and stealing sugar as<br/>opportunity offered, Aunt Polly asked him questions that were full<br/>of guile, and very deep — for she wanted to trap him into damaging<br/>revealments. Like many other simple-hearted souls, it was her pet<br/>vanity to believe she was endowed with a talent for dark and<br/>mysterious diplomacy, and she loved to contemplate her most<br/>transparent devices as marvels of low cunning. Said she:<br/><br/>"Tom, it was middling warm in school, warn't it?"<br/><br/>"Yes'm."<br/><br/>
