"It was just so with my Joe — always full of his devilment, and<br/>up to every kind of mischief, but he was just as unselfish and kind<br/>as he could be — and laws bless me, to think I went and whipped him<br/>for taking that cream, never once recollecting that I throwed it<br/>out myself because it was sour, and I never to see him again in<br/>this world, never, never, never, poor abused boy!" And Mrs. Harper<br/>sobbed as if her heart would break.<br/><br/>"I hope Tom's better off where he is," said Sid, "but if he'd<br/>been better in some ways —"<br/><br/>"Sid!" Tom felt the glare of the old lady's eye, though he could<br/>not see it. "Not a word against my Tom, now that he's gone! God'll<br/>take care of him — never you trouble yourself, sir! Oh, Mrs.<br/>Harper, I don't know how to give him up! I don't know how to give<br/>him up! He was such a comfort to me, although he tormented my old<br/>heart out of me, 'most."<br/><br/>"The Lord giveth and the Lord hath taken away — Blessed be the<br/>name of the Lord! But it's so hard — Oh, it's so hard! Only last<br/>Saturday my Joe busted a firecracker right under my nose and I<br/>knocked him sprawling. Little did I know then, how soon — Oh, if it<br/>was to do over again I'd hug him and bless him for it."<br/><br/>"Yes, yes, yes, I know just how you feel, Mrs. Harper, I know<br/>just exactly how you feel. No longer ago than yesterday noon, my<br/>Tom took and filled the cat full of Pain-killer, and I did think<br/>the cretur would tear the house down. And God forgive me, I cracked<br/>Tom's head with my thimble, poor boy, poor dead boy. But he's out<br/>of all his troubles now. And the last words I ever heard him say<br/>was to reproach —"<br/><br/>But this memory was too much for the old lady, and she broke<br/>entirely down. Tom was snuffling, now, himself — and more in pity<br/>of himself than anybody else. He could hear Mary crying, and<br/>putting in a kindly word for him from time to time. He began to<br/>have a nobler opinion of himself than ever before. Still, he was<br/>sufficiently touched by his aunt's grief to long to rush out from<br/>under the bed and overwhelm her with joy — and the theatrical<br/>gorgeousness of the thing appealed strongly to his nature, too, but<br/>he resisted and lay still.<br/><br/>He went on listening, and gathered by odds and ends that it was<br/>conjectured at first that the boys had got drowned while taking a<br/>swim; then the small raft had been missed; next, certain boys said<br/>the missing lads had promised that the village should "hear<br/>something" soon; the wise-heads had "put this and that together"<br/>and decided that the lads had gone off on that raft and would turn<br/>up at the next town below, presently; but toward noon the raft had<br/>been found, lodged against the Missouri shore some five or six<br/>miles below the village — and then hope perished; they must be<br/>drowned, else hunger would have driven them home by nightfall if<br/>not sooner. It was believed that the search for the bodies had been<br/>a fruitless effort merely because the drowning must have occurred<br/>in midchannel, since the boys, being good swimmers, would otherwise<br/>have escaped to shore. This was Wednesday night. If the bodies<br/>continued missing until Sunday, all hope would be given over, and<br/>the funerals would be preached on that morning. Tom shuddered.<br/><br/>Mrs. Harper gave a sobbing good-night and turned to go. Then<br/>with a mutual impulse the two bereaved women flung themselves into<br/>each other's arms and had a good, consoling cry, and then parted.<br/>Aunt Polly was tender far beyond her wont, in her good-night to Sid<br/>and Mary. Sid snuffled a bit and Mary went off crying with all her<br/>heart.<br/><br/>Aunt Polly knelt down and prayed for Tom so touchingly, so<br/>appealingly, and with such measureless love in her words and her<br/>old trembling voice, that he was weltering in tears again, long<br/>before she was through.<br/><br/>He had to keep still long after she went to bed, for she kept<br/>making broken-hearted ejaculations from time to time, tossing<br/>unrestfully, and turning over. But at last she was still, only<br/>moaning a little in her sleep. Now the boy stole out, rose<br/>gradually by the bedside, shaded the candle-light with his hand,<br/>and stood regarding her. His heart was full of pity for her. He<br/>took out his sycamore scroll and placed it by the candle. But<br/>something occurred to him, and he lingered considering. His face<br/>lighted with a happy solution of his thought; he put the bark<br/>hastily in his pocket. Then he bent over and kissed the faded lips,<br/>and straightway made his stealthy exit, latching the door behind<br/>him.<br/><br/>He threaded his way back to the ferry landing, found nobody at<br/>large there, and walked boldly on board the boat, for he knew she<br/>was tenantless except that there was a watchman, who always turned<br/>in and slept like a graven image. He untied the skiff at the stern,<br/>slipped into it, and was soon rowing cautiously upstream. When he<br/>had pulled a mile above the village, he started quartering across<br/>and bent himself stoutly to his work. He hit the landing on the<br/>other side neatly, for this was a familiar bit of work to him. He<br/>was moved to capture the skiff, arguing that it might be considered<br/>a ship and therefore legitimate prey for a pirate, but he knew a<br/>thorough search would be made for it and that might end in<br/>revelations. So he stepped ashore and entered the woods.<br/>
