"You've been mighty good to me, boys — better'n anybody else in<br/>this town. And I don't forget it, I don't. Often I says to myself,<br/>says I, 'I used to mend all the boys' kites and things, and show<br/>'em where the good fishin' places was, and befriend 'em what I<br/>could, and now they've all forgot old Muff when he's in trouble;<br/>but Tom don't, and Huck don't — they don't forget him, says I, 'and<br/>I don't forget them.' Well, boys, I done an awful thing — drunk and<br/>crazy at the time — that's the only way I account for it — and now<br/>I got to swing for it, and it's right. Right, and best, too, I<br/>reckon — hope so, anyway. Well, we won't talk about that. I don't<br/>want to make you feel bad; you've befriended me. But what I want to<br/>say, is, don't you ever get drunk — then you won't ever get here.<br/>Stand a litter furder west — so — that's it; it's a prime comfort<br/>to see faces that's friendly when a body's in such a muck of<br/>trouble, and there don't none come here but yourn. Good friendly<br/>faces — good friendly faces. Git up on one another's backs and let<br/>me touch 'em. That's it. Shake hands — yourn'll come through the<br/>bars, but mine's too big. Little hands, and weak — but they've<br/>helped Muff Potter a power, and they'd help him more if they<br/>could."<br/><br/>Tom went home miserable, and his dreams that night were full of<br/>horrors. The next day and the day after, he hung about the<br/>court-room, drawn by an almost irresistible impulse to go in, but<br/>forcing himself to stay out. Huck was having the same experience.<br/>They studiously avoided each other. Each wandered away, from time<br/>to time, but the same dismal fascination always brought them back<br/>presently. Tom kept his ears open when idlers sauntered out of the<br/>courtroom, but invariably heard distressing news — the toils were<br/>closing more and more relentlessly around poor Potter. At the end<br/>of the second day the village talk was to the effect that Injun<br/>Joe's evidence stood firm and unshaken, and that there was not the<br/>slightest question as to what the jury's verdict would be.<br/><br/>Tom was out late, that night, and came to bed through the<br/>window. He was in a tremendous state of excitement. It was hours<br/>before he got to sleep. All the village flocked to the court-house<br/>the next morning, for this was to be the great day. Both sexes were<br/>about equally represented in the packed audience. After a long wait<br/>the jury filed in and took their places; shortly afterward, Potter,<br/>pale and haggard, timid and hopeless, was brought in, with chains<br/>upon him, and seated where all the curious eyes could stare at him;<br/>no less conspicuous was Injun Joe, stolid as ever. There was<br/>another pause, and then the judge arrived and the sheriff<br/>proclaimed the opening of the court. The usual whisperings among<br/>the lawyers and gathering together of papers followed. These<br/>details and accompanying delays worked up an atmosphere of<br/>preparation that was as impressive as it was fascinating.<br/><br/>Now a witness was called who testified that he found Muff Potter<br/>washing in the brook, at an early hour of the morning that the<br/>murder was discovered, and that he immediately sneaked away. After<br/>some further questioning, counsel for the prosecution said:<br/><br/>"Take the witness."<br/><br/>The prisoner raised his eyes for a moment, but dropped them<br/>again when his own counsel said:<br/><br/>"I have no questions to ask him."<br/><br/>The next witness proved the finding of the knife near the<br/>corpse. Counsel for the prosecution said:<br/><br/>"Take the witness."<br/><br/>"I have no questions to ask him," Potter's lawyer replied.<br/><br/>A third witness swore he had often seen the knife in Potter's<br/>possession.<br/>
