"Oh, you don't want to see!"<br/><br/>"Now that you treat me so, I will see." And she put her small<br/>hand upon his and a little scuffle ensued, Tom pretending to resist<br/>in earnest but letting his hand slip by degrees till these words<br/>were revealed: "I love You."<br/><br/>"Oh, you bad thing!" And she hit his hand a smart rap, but<br/>reddened and looked pleased, nevertheless.<br/><br/>Just at this juncture the boy felt a slow, fateful grip closing<br/>on his ear, and a steady lifting impulse. In that vise he was borne<br/>across the house and deposited in his own seat, under a peppering<br/>fire of giggles from the whole school. Then the master stood over<br/>him during a few awful moments, and finally moved away to his<br/>throne without saying a word. But although Tom's ear tingled, his<br/>heart was jubilant.<br/><br/>As the school quieted down Tom made an honest effort to study,<br/>but the turmoil within him was too great. In turn he took his place<br/>in the reading class and made a botch of it; then in the geography<br/>class and turned lakes into mountains, mountains into rivers, and<br/>rivers into continents, till chaos was come again; then in the<br/>spelling class, and got "turned down," by a succession of mere baby<br/>words, till he brought up at the foot and yielded up the pewter<br/>medal which he had worn with ostentation for months.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
