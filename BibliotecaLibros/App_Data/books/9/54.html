<br/>"Put on your bonnet and let on you're going home; and when you<br/>get to the corner, give the rest of 'em the slip, and turn down<br/>through the lane and come back. I'll go the other way and come it<br/>over 'em the same way."<br/><br/>So the one went off with one group of scholars, and the other<br/>with another. In a little while the two met at the bottom of the<br/>lane, and when they reached the school they had it all to<br/>themselves. Then they sat together, with a slate before them, and<br/>Tom gave Becky the pencil and held her hand in his, guiding it, and<br/>so created another surprising house. When the interest in art began<br/>to wane, the two fell to talking. Tom was swimming in bliss. He<br/>said:<br/><br/>"Do you love rats?"<br/><br/>"No! I hate them!"<br/><br/>"Well, I do, too â€” live ones. But I mean dead ones, to swing<br/>round your head with a string."<br/><br/>"No, I don't care for rats much, anyway. What I like is<br/>chewing-gum."<br/><br/>"Oh, I should say so! I wish I had some now."<br/><br/>"Do you? I've got some. I'll let you chew it awhile, but you<br/>must give it back to me."<br/><br/>That was agreeable, so they chewed it turn about, and dangled<br/>their legs against the bench in excess of contentment.<br/><br/>"Was you ever at a circus?" said Tom.<br/><br/>
