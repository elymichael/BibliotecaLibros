"It's about five mile into there the way anybody but me would<br/>go, Huck, but there's a mighty short cut that they don't anybody<br/>but me know about. Huck, I'll take you right to it in a skiff. I'll<br/>float the skiff down there, and I'll pull it back again all by<br/>myself. You needn't ever turn your hand over."<br/><br/>"Less start right off, Tom."<br/><br/>"All right. We want some bread and meat, and our pipes, and a<br/>little bag or two, and two or three kite-strings, and some of these<br/>new-fangled things they call lucifer matches. I tell you, many's<br/>the time I wished I had some when I was in there before."<br/><br/>A trifle after noon the boys borrowed a small skiff from a<br/>citizen who was absent, and got under way at once. When they were<br/>several miles below "Cave Hollow," Tom said:<br/><br/>"Now you see this bluff here looks all alike all the way down<br/>from the cave hollow — no houses, no wood-yards, bushes all alike.<br/>But do you see that white place up yonder where there's been a<br/>landslide? Well, that's one of my marks. We'll get ashore,<br/>now."<br/><br/>They landed.<br/><br/>"Now, Huck, where we're a-standing you could touch that hole I<br/>got out of with a fishing-pole. See if you can find it."<br/><br/>Huck searched all the place about, and found nothing. Tom<br/>proudly marched into a thick clump of sumach bushes and said:<br/><br/>"Here you are! Look at it, Huck; it's the snuggest hole in this<br/>country. You just keep mum about it. All along I've been wanting to<br/>be a robber, but I knew I'd got to have a thing like this, and<br/>where to run across it was the bother. We've got it now, and we'll<br/>keep it quiet, only we'll let Joe Harper and Ben Rogers in —<br/>because of course there's got to be a Gang, or else there wouldn't<br/>be any style about it. Tom Sawyer's Gang — it sounds splendid,<br/>don't it, Huck?"<br/><br/>"Well, it just does, Tom. And who'll we rob?"<br/><br/>"Oh, most anybody. Waylay people — that's mostly the way."<br/>
