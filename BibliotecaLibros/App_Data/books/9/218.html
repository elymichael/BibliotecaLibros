<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>36<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>So endeth this chronicle. It being strictly a history of a boy,<br/>it must stop here; the story could not go much further without<br/>becoming the history of a man. When one writes a novel about grown<br/>people, he knows exactly where to stop â€” that is, with a marriage;<br/>but when he writes of juveniles, he must stop where he best<br/>can.<br/><br/>Most of the characters that perform in this book still live, and<br/>are prosperous and happy. Some day it may seem worth while to take<br/>up the story of the younger ones again and see what sort of men and<br/>women they turned out to be; therefore it will be wisest not to<br/>reveal any of that part of their lives at present.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
