Huck said:<br/><br/>"I can't — I'd die if they was to wake."<br/><br/>Tom urged — Huck held back. At last Tom rose slowly and softly,<br/>and started alone. But the first step he made wrung such a hideous<br/>creak from the crazy floor that he sank down almost dead with<br/>fright. He never made a second attempt. The boys lay there counting<br/>the dragging moments till it seemed to them that time must be done<br/>and eternity growing gray; and then they were grateful to note that<br/>at last the sun was setting.<br/><br/>Now one snore ceased. Injun Joe sat up, stared around — smiled<br/>grimly upon his comrade, whose head was drooping upon his knees —<br/>stirred him up with his foot and said:<br/><br/>"Here! You're a watchman, ain't you! All right, though —<br/>nothing's happened."<br/><br/>"My! have I been asleep?"<br/><br/>"Oh, partly, partly. Nearly time for us to be moving, pard.<br/>What'll we do with what little swag we've got left?"<br/><br/>"I don't know — leave it here as we've always done, I reckon. No<br/>use to take it away till we start south. Six hundred and fifty in<br/>silver's something to carry."<br/><br/>"Well — all right — it won't matter to come here once more."<br/><br/>"No — but I'd say come in the night as we used to do — it's<br/>better."<br/><br/>"Yes: but look here; it may be a good while before I get the<br/>right chance at that job; accidents might happen; 'tain't in such a<br/>very good place; we'll just regularly bury it — and bury it<br/>deep."<br/>
