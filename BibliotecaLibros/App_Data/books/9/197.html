<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>32<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>Tuesday afternoon came, and waned to the twilight. The village<br/>of St. Petersburg still mourned. The lost children had not been<br/>found. Public prayers had been offered up for them, and many and<br/>many a private prayer that had the petitioner's whole heart in it;<br/>but still no good news came from the cave. The majority of the<br/>searchers had given up the quest and gone back to their daily<br/>avocations, saying that it was plain the children could never be<br/>found. Mrs. Thatcher was very ill, and a great part of the time<br/>delirious. People said it was heartbreaking to hear her call her<br/>child, and raise her head and listen a whole minute at a time, then<br/>lay it wearily down again with a moan. Aunt Polly had drooped into<br/>a settled melancholy, and her gray hair had grown almost white. The<br/>village went to its rest on Tuesday night, sad and forlorn. Away in<br/>the middle of the night a wild peal burst from the village bells,<br/>and in a moment the streets were swarming with frantic half-clad<br/>people, who shouted, "Turn out! turn out! they're found! they're<br/>found!" Tin pans and horns were added to the din, the population<br/>massed itself and moved toward the river, met the children coming<br/>in an open carriage drawn by shouting citizens, thronged around it,<br/>joined its homeward march, and swept magnificently up the main<br/>street roaring huzzah after huzzah!<br/><br/>The village was illuminated; nobody went to bed again; it was<br/>the greatest night the little town had ever seen. During the first<br/>half-hour a procession of villagers filed through Judge Thatcher's<br/>house, seized the saved ones and kissed them, squeezed Mrs.<br/>Thatcher's hand, tried to speak but couldn't — and drifted out<br/>raining tears all over the place.<br/><br/>Aunt Polly's happiness was complete, and Mrs. Thatcher's nearly<br/>so. It would be complete, however, as soon as the messenger<br/>dispatched with the great news to the cave should get the word to<br/>her husband. Tom lay upon a sofa with an eager auditory about him<br/>and told the history of the wonderful adventure, putting in many<br/>striking additions to adorn it withal; and closed with a<br/>description of how he left Becky and went on an exploring<br/>expedition; how he followed two avenues as far as his kite-line<br/>would reach; how he followed a third to the fullest stretch of the<br/>kite-line, and was about to turn back when he glimpsed a far-off<br/>speck that looked like daylight; dropped the line and groped toward<br/>it, pushed his head and shoulders through a small hole, and saw the<br/>broad Mississippi rolling by! And if it had only happened to be<br/>night he would not have seen that speck of daylight and would not<br/>have explored that passage any more! He told how he went back for<br/>Becky and broke the good news and she told him not to fret her with<br/>such stuff, for she was tired, and knew she was going to die, and<br/>wanted to. He described how he labored with her and convinced her;<br/>and how she almost died for joy when she had groped to where she<br/>actually saw the blue speck of daylight; how he pushed his way out<br/>at the hole and then helped her out; how they sat there and cried<br/>for gladness; how some men came along in a skiff and Tom hailed<br/>them and told them their situation and their famished condition;<br/>how the men didn't believe the wild tale at first, "because," said<br/>they, "you are five miles down the river below the valley the cave<br/>is in" — then took them aboard, rowed to a house, gave them supper,<br/>made them rest till two or three hours after dark and then brought<br/>them home.<br/><br/>Before day-dawn, Judge Thatcher and the handful of searchers<br/>with him were tracked out, in the cave, by the twine clews they had<br/>strung behind them, and informed of the great news.<br/><br/>Three days and nights of toil and hunger in the cave were not to<br/>be shaken off at once, as Tom and Becky soon discovered. They were<br/>bedridden all of Wednesday and Thursday, and seemed to grow more<br/>and more tired and worn, all the time. Tom got about, a little, on<br/>Thursday, was down-town Friday, and nearly as whole as ever<br/>Saturday; but Becky did not leave her room until Sunday, and then<br/>she looked as if she had passed through a wasting illness.<br/><br/>Tom learned of Huck's sickness and went to see him on Friday,<br/>but could not be admitted to the bedroom; neither could he on<br/>Saturday or Sunday. He was admitted daily after that, but was<br/>warned to keep still about his adventure and introduce no exciting<br/>topic. The Widow Douglas stayed by to see that he obeyed. At home<br/>Tom learned of the Cardiff Hill event; also that the "ragged man's"<br/>body had eventually been found in the river near the ferry-landing;<br/>he had been drowned while trying to escape, perhaps.<br/><br/>
