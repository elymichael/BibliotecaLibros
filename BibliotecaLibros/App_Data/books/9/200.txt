"Why, Huck, I never told on that tavern-keeper. You know his
tavern was all right the Saturday I went to the picnic. Don't you
remember you was to watch there that night?"

"Oh yes! Why, it seems 'bout a year ago. It was that very night
that I follered Injun Joe to the widder's."

"You followed him?"

"Yes — but you keep mum. I reckon Injun Joe's left friends
behind him, and I don't want 'em souring on me and doing me mean
tricks. If it hadn't ben for me he'd be down in Texas now, all
right."

Then Huck told his entire adventure in confidence to Tom, who
had only heard of the Welshman's part of it before.

"Well," said Huck, presently, coming back to the main question,
"whoever nipped the whiskey in No. 2, nipped the money, too, I
reckon — anyways it's a goner for us, Tom."

"Huck, that money wasn't ever in No. 2!"

"What!" Huck searched his comrade's face keenly. "Tom, have you
got on the track of that money again?"

"Huck, it's in the cave!"

Huck's eyes blazed.

"Say it again, Tom."
