About midnight Tom arrived with a boiled ham and a few trifles,<br/>and stopped in a dense undergrowth on a small bluff overlooking the<br/>meeting-place. It was starlight, and very still. The mighty river<br/>lay like an ocean at rest. Tom listened a moment, but no sound<br/>disturbed the quiet. Then he gave a low, distinct whistle. It was<br/>answered from under the bluff. Tom whistled twice more; these<br/>signals were answered in the same way. Then a guarded voice<br/>said:<br/><br/>"Who goes there?"<br/><br/>"Tom Sawyer, the Black Avenger of the Spanish Main. Name your<br/>names."<br/><br/>"Huck Finn the Red-Handed, and Joe Harper the Terror of the<br/>Seas." Tom had furnished these titles, from his favorite<br/>literature.<br/><br/>"'Tis well. Give the countersign."<br/><br/>Two hoarse whispers delivered the same awful word simultaneously<br/>to the brooding night:<br/><br/>"Blood!"<br/><br/>Then Tom tumbled his ham over the bluff and let himself down<br/>after it, tearing both skin and clothes to some extent in the<br/>effort. There was an easy, comfortable path along the shore under<br/>the bluff, but it lacked the advantages of difficulty and danger so<br/>valued by a pirate.<br/><br/>The Terror of the Seas had brought a side of bacon, and had<br/>about worn himself out with getting it there. Finn the Red-Handed<br/>had stolen a skillet and a quantity of half-cured leaf tobacco, and<br/>had also brought a few corn-cobs to make pipes with. But none of<br/>the pirates smoked or "chewed" but himself. The Black Avenger of<br/>the Spanish Main said it would never do to start without some fire.<br/>That was a wise thought; matches were hardly known there in that<br/>day. They saw a fire smouldering upon a great raft a hundred yards<br/>above, and they went stealthily thither and helped themselves to a<br/>chunk. They made an imposing adventure of it, saying, "Hist!" every<br/>now and then, and suddenly halting with finger on lip; moving with<br/>hands on imaginary dagger-hilts; and giving orders in dismal<br/>whispers that if "the foe" stirred, to "let him have it to the<br/>hilt," because "dead men tell no tales." They knew well enough that<br/>the raftsmen were all down at the village laying in stores or<br/>having a spree, but still that was no excuse for their conducting<br/>this thing in an unpiratical way.<br/><br/>They shoved off, presently, Tom in command, Huck at the after<br/>oar and Joe at the forward. Tom stood amidships, gloomy-browed, and<br/>with folded arms, and gave his orders in a low, stern whisper:<br/><br/>"Luff, and bring her to the wind!"<br/>
