<br/>"What's a yew bow?"<br/><br/>"I don't know. It's some kind of a bow, of course. And if he hit<br/>that dime only on the edge he would set down and cry — and curse.<br/>But we'll play Robin Hood — it's nobby fun. I'll learn you."<br/><br/>"I'm agreed."<br/><br/>So they played Robin Hood all the afternoon, now and then<br/>casting a yearning eye down upon the haunted house and passing a<br/>remark about the morrow's prospects and possibilities there. As the<br/>sun began to sink into the west they took their way homeward<br/>athwart the long shadows of the trees and soon were buried from<br/>sight in the forests of Cardiff Hill.<br/><br/>On Saturday, shortly after noon, the boys were at the dead tree<br/>again. They had a smoke and a chat in the shade, and then dug a<br/>little in their last hole, not with great hope, but merely because<br/>Tom said there were so many cases where people had given up a<br/>treasure after getting down within six inches of it, and then<br/>somebody else had come along and turned it up with a single thrust<br/>of a shovel. The thing failed this time, however, so the boys<br/>shouldered their tools and went away feeling that they had not<br/>trifled with fortune, but had fulfilled all the requirements that<br/>belong to the business of treasure-hunting.<br/><br/>When they reached the haunted house there was something so weird<br/>and grisly about the dead silence that reigned there under the<br/>baking sun, and something so depressing about the loneliness and<br/>desolation of the place, that they were afraid, for a moment, to<br/>venture in. Then they crept to the door and took a trembling peep.<br/>They saw a weed-grown, floorless room, unplastered, an ancient<br/>fireplace, vacant windows, a ruinous staircase; and here, there,<br/>and everywhere hung ragged and abandoned cobwebs. They presently<br/>entered, softly, with quickened pulses, talking in whispers, ears<br/>alert to catch the slightest sound, and muscles tense and ready for<br/>instant retreat.<br/><br/>In a little while familiarity modified their fears and they gave<br/>the place a critical and interested examination, rather admiring<br/>their own boldness, and wondering at it, too. Next they wanted to<br/>look up-stairs. This was something like cutting off retreat, but<br/>they got to daring each other, and of course there could be but one<br/>result — they threw their tools into a corner and made the ascent.<br/>Up there were the same signs of decay. In one corner they found a<br/>closet that promised mystery, but the promise was a fraud — there<br/>was nothing in it. Their courage was up now and well in hand. They<br/>were about to go down and begin work when —<br/><br/>"Sh!" said Tom.<br/><br/>"What is it?" whispered Huck, blanching with fright.<br/><br/>"Sh!&#160;… There!&#160;… Hear it?"<br/><br/>
