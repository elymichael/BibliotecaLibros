"The money's in the cave!"

"Tom — honest injun, now — is it fun, or earnest?"

"Earnest, Huck — just as earnest as ever I was in my life. Will
you go in there with me and help get it out?"

"I bet I will! I will if it's where we can blaze our way to it
and not get lost."

"Huck, we can do that without the least little bit of trouble in
the world."

"Good as wheat! What makes you think the money's —"

"Huck, you just wait till we get in there. If we don't find it
I'll agree to give you my drum and every thing I've got in the
world. I will, by jings."

"All right — it's a whiz. When do you say?"

"Right now, if you say it. Are you strong enough?"

"Is it far in the cave? I ben on my pins a little, three or four
days, now, but I can't walk more'n a mile, Tom — least I don't
think I could."
