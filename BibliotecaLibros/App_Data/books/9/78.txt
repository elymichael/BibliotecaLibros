"Look, Hucky, look! He's got his back to us!"

Hucky looked, with joy in his heart.

"Well, he has, by jingoes! Did he before?"

"Yes, he did. But I, like a fool, never thought. Oh, this is

"Sh! What's that?" he whispered.

"Sounds like — like hogs grunting. No — it's somebody snoring,
Tom."

"That is it! Where 'bouts is it, Huck?"

"I bleeve it's down at 'tother end. Sounds so, anyway. Pap used
to sleep there, sometimes, 'long with the hogs, but laws bless you,
he just lifts things when he snores. Besides, I reckon he ain't
ever coming back to this town any more."
