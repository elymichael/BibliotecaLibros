"Tom," whispered Huckleberry, "does this keep us from ever
telling — always?"

"Of course it does. It don't make any difference what happens,
we got to keep mum. We'd drop down dead — don't you know that?"

"Yes, I reckon that's so."

They continued to whisper for some little time. Presently a dog
set up a long, lugubrious howl just outside — within ten feet of
them. The boys clasped each other suddenly, in an agony of
fright.

"Which of us does he mean?" gasped Huckleberry.

"I dono — peep through the crack. Quick!"

"No, you, Tom!"

"I can't — I can't do it, Huck!"

"Please, Tom. There 'tis again!"

"Oh, lordy, I'm thankful!" whispered Tom. "I know his voice.
It's Bull Harbison." *
