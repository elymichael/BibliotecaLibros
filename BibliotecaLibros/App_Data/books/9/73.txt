"Why, I know it, Tom."

Tom thought a while, then he said:

"Who'll tell? We?"

"What are you talking about? S'pose something happened and Injun
Joe didn't hang? Why, he'd kill us some time or other, just as dead
sure as we're a laying here."

"That's just what I was thinking to myself, Huck."

"If anybody tells, let Muff Potter do it, if he's fool enough.
He's generally drunk enough."

Tom said nothing â€” went on thinking. Presently he whispered:

"Huck, Muff Potter don't know it. How can he tell?"

"What's the reason he don't know it?"

"Because he'd just got that whack when Injun Joe done it. D'you
reckon he could see anything? D'you reckon he knowed anything?"

"By hokey, that's so, Tom!"
