<br/>"Oh, Tom, you didn't make any marks!"<br/><br/>"Becky, I was such a fool! Such a fool! I never thought we might<br/>want to come back! No — I can't find the way. It's all mixed<br/>up."<br/><br/>"Tom, Tom, we're lost! we're lost! We never can get out of this<br/>awful place! Oh, why did we ever leave the others!"<br/><br/>She sank to the ground and burst into such a frenzy of crying<br/>that Tom was appalled with the idea that she might die, or lose her<br/>reason. He sat down by her and put his arms around her; she buried<br/>her face in his bosom, she clung to him, she poured out her<br/>terrors, her unavailing regrets, and the far echoes turned them all<br/>to jeering laughter. Tom begged her to pluck up hope again, and she<br/>said she could not. He fell to blaming and abusing himself for<br/>getting her into this miserable situation; this had a better<br/>effect. She said she would try to hope again, she would get up and<br/>follow wherever he might lead if only he would not talk like that<br/>any more. For he was no more to blame than she, she said.<br/><br/>So they moved on again — aimlessly — simply at random — all they<br/>could do was to move, keep moving. For a little while, hope made a<br/>show of reviving — not with any reason to back it, but only because<br/>it is its nature to revive when the spring has not been taken out<br/>of it by age and familiarity with failure.<br/><br/>By-and-by Tom took Becky's candle and blew it out. This economy<br/>meant so much! Words were not needed. Becky understood, and her<br/>hope died again. She knew that Tom had a whole candle and three or<br/>four pieces in his pockets — yet he must economize.<br/><br/>By-and-by, fatigue began to assert its claims; the children<br/>tried to pay attention, for it was dreadful to think of sitting<br/>down when time was grown to be so precious, moving, in some<br/>direction, in any direction, was at least progress and might bear<br/>fruit; but to sit down was to invite death and shorten its<br/>pursuit.<br/><br/>At last Becky's frail limbs refused to carry her farther. She<br/>sat down. Tom rested with her, and they talked of home, and the<br/>friends there, and the comfortable beds and, above all, the light!<br/>Becky cried, and Tom tried to think of some way of comforting her,<br/>but all his encouragements were grown threadbare with use, and<br/>sounded like sarcasms. Fatigue bore so heavily upon Becky that she<br/>drowsed off to sleep. Tom was grateful. He sat looking into her<br/>drawn face and saw it grow smooth and natural under the influence<br/>of pleasant dreams; and by-and-by a smile dawned and rested there.<br/>The peaceful face reflected somewhat of peace and healing into his<br/>own spirit, and his thoughts wandered away to bygone times and<br/>dreamy memories. While he was deep in his musings, Becky woke up<br/>with a breezy little laugh — but it was stricken dead upon her<br/>lips, and a groan followed it.<br/><br/>"Oh, how could I sleep! I wish I never, never had waked! No! No,<br/>I don't, Tom! Don't look so! I won't say it again."<br/><br/>"I'm glad you've slept, Becky; you'll feel rested, now, and<br/>we'll find the way out."<br/><br/>
