"What do you call work?"

"Why, ain't that work?"

Tom resumed his whitewashing, and answered carelessly:

"Well, maybe it is, and maybe it ain't. All I know, is, it suits
Tom Sawyer."

"Oh come, now, you don't mean to let on that you like it?"

The brush continued to move.

"Like it? Well, I don't see why I oughtn't to like it. Does a
boy get a chance to whitewash a fence every day?"

That put the thing in a new light. Ben stopped nibbling his
apple. Tom swept his brush daintily back and forth — stepped back
to note the effect — added a touch here and there — criticised the
effect again — Ben watching every move and getting more and more
interested, more and more absorbed. Presently he said:

"Say, Tom, let me whitewash a little."

Tom considered, was about to consent; but he altered his
mind:

"No — no — I reckon it wouldn't hardly do, Ben. You see, Aunt
Polly's awful particular about this fence — right here on the
street, you know — but if it was the back fence I wouldn't mind and
she wouldn't. Yes, she's awful particular about this fence; it's
got to be done very careful; I reckon there ain't one boy in a
thousand, maybe two thousand, that can do it the way it's got to be
done."
