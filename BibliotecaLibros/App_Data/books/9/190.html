<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>31<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>Now to return to Tom and Becky's share in the picnic. They<br/>tripped along the murky aisles with the rest of the company,<br/>visiting the familiar wonders of the cave — wonders dubbed with<br/>rather overdescriptive names, such as "The Drawing-Room," "The<br/>Cathedral," "Aladdin's Palace," and so on. Presently the<br/>hide-and-seek frolicking began, and Tom and Becky engaged in it<br/>with zeal until the exertion began to grow a trifle wearisome; then<br/>they wandered down a sinuous avenue holding their candles aloft and<br/>reading the tangled web-work of names, dates, post-office<br/>addresses, and mottoes with which the rocky walls had been frescoed<br/>(in candle-smoke). Still drifting along and talking, they scarcely<br/>noticed that they were now in a part of the cave whose walls were<br/>not frescoed. They smoked their own names under an overhanging<br/>shelf and moved on. Presently they came to a place where a little<br/>stream of water, trickling over a ledge and carrying a limestone<br/>sediment with it, had, in the slow-dragging ages, formed a laced<br/>and ruffled Niagara in gleaming and imperishable stone. Tom<br/>squeezed his small body behind it in order to illuminate it for<br/>Becky's gratification. He found that it curtained a sort of steep<br/>natural stairway which was enclosed between narrow walls, and at<br/>once the ambition to be a discoverer seized him. Becky responded to<br/>his call, and they made a smoke-mark for future guidance, and<br/>started upon their quest. They wound this way and that, far down<br/>into the secret depths of the cave, made another mark, and branched<br/>off in search of novelties to tell the upper world about. In one<br/>place they found a spacious cavern, from whose ceiling depended a<br/>multitude of shining stalactites of the length and circumference of<br/>a man's leg; they walked all about it, wondering and admiring, and<br/>presently left it by one of the numerous passages that opened into<br/>it. This shortly brought them to a bewitching spring, whose basin<br/>was incrusted with a frostwork of glittering crystals; it was in<br/>the midst of a cavern whose walls were supported by many fantastic<br/>pillars which had been formed by the joining of great stalactites<br/>and stalagmites together, the result of the ceaseless water-drip of<br/>centuries. Under the roof vast knots of bats had packed themselves<br/>together, thousands in a bunch; the lights disturbed the creatures<br/>and they came flocking down by hundreds, squeaking and darting<br/>furiously at the candles. Tom knew their ways and the danger of<br/>this sort of conduct. He seized Becky's hand and hurried her into<br/>the first corridor that offered; and none too soon, for a bat<br/>struck Becky's light out with its wing while she was passing out of<br/>the cavern. The bats chased the children a good distance; but the<br/>fugitives plunged into every new passage that offered, and at last<br/>got rid of the perilous things. Tom found a subterranean lake,<br/>shortly, which stretched its dim length away until its shape was<br/>lost in the shadows. He wanted to explore its borders, but<br/>concluded that it would be best to sit down and rest awhile, first.<br/>Now, for the first time, the deep stillness of the place laid a<br/>clammy hand upon the spirits of the children. Becky said: "Why, I<br/>didn't notice, but it seems ever so long since I heard any of the<br/>others."<br/><br/>"Come to think, Becky, we are away down below them — and I don't<br/>know how far away north, or south, or east, or whichever it is. We<br/>couldn't hear them here."<br/><br/>Becky grew apprehensive.<br/><br/>"I wonder how long we've been down here, Tom? We better start<br/>back."<br/><br/>"Yes, I reckon we better. P'raps we better."<br/><br/>"Can you find the way, Tom? It's all a mixed-up crookedness to<br/>me."<br/><br/>
