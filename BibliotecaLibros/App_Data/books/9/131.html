<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>21<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>Vacation was approaching. The schoolmaster, always severe, grew<br/>severer and more exacting than ever, for he wanted the school to<br/>make a good showing on "Examination" day. His rod and his ferule<br/>were seldom idle now — at least among the smaller pupils. Only the<br/>biggest boys, and young ladies of eighteen and twenty, escaped<br/>lashing. Mr. Dobbins' lashings were very vigorous ones, too; for<br/>although he carried, under his wig, a perfectly bald and shiny<br/>head, he had only reached middle age, and there was no sign of<br/>feebleness in his muscle. As the great day approached, all the<br/>tyranny that was in him came to the surface; he seemed to take a<br/>vindictive pleasure in punishing the least shortcomings. The<br/>consequence was, that the smaller boys spent their days in terror<br/>and suffering and their nights in plotting revenge. They threw away<br/>no opportunity to do the master a mischief. But he kept ahead all<br/>the time. The retribution that followed every vengeful success was<br/>so sweeping and majestic that the boys always retired from the<br/>field badly worsted. At last they conspired together and hit upon a<br/>plan that promised a dazzling victory. They swore in the<br/>sign-painter's boy, told him the scheme, and asked his help. He had<br/>his own reasons for being delighted, for the master boarded in his<br/>father's family and had given the boy ample cause to hate him. The<br/>master's wife would go on a visit to the country in a few days, and<br/>there would be nothing to interfere with the plan; the master<br/>always prepared himself for great occasions by getting pretty well<br/>fuddled, and the sign-painter's boy said that when the dominie had<br/>reached the proper condition on Examination Evening he would<br/>"manage the thing" while he napped in his chair; then he would have<br/>him awakened at the right time and hurried away to school. In the<br/>fulness of time the interesting occasion arrived. At eight in the<br/>evening the schoolhouse was brilliantly lighted, and adorned with<br/>wreaths and festoons of foliage and flowers. The master sat throned<br/>in his great chair upon a raised platform, with his blackboard<br/>behind him. He was looking tolerably mellow. Three rows of benches<br/>on each side and six rows in front of him were occupied by the<br/>dignitaries of the town and by the parents of the pupils. To his<br/>left, back of the rows of citizens, was a spacious temporary<br/>platform upon which were seated the scholars who were to take part<br/>in the exercises of the evening; rows of small boys, washed and<br/>dressed to an intolerable state of discomfort; rows of gawky big<br/>boys; snowbanks of girls and young ladies clad in lawn and muslin<br/>and conspicuously conscious of their bare arms, their grandmothers'<br/>ancient trinkets, their bits of pink and blue ribbon and the<br/>flowers in their hair. All the rest of the house was filled with<br/>non-participating scholars.<br/><br/>The exercises began. A very little boy stood up and sheepishly<br/>recited, "You'd scarce expect one of my age to speak in public on<br/>the stage," etc. — accompanying himself with the painfully exact<br/>and spasmodic gestures which a machine might have used — supposing<br/>the machine to be a trifle out of order. But he got through safely,<br/>though cruelly scared, and got a fine round of applause when he<br/>made his manufactured bow and retired.<br/><br/>A little shamefaced girl lisped, "Mary had a little lamb," etc.,<br/>performed a compassion-inspiring curtsy, got her meed of applause,<br/>and sat down flushed and happy.<br/><br/>Tom Sawyer stepped forward with conceited confidence and soared<br/>into the unquenchable and indestructible "Give me liberty or give<br/>me death" speech, with fine fury and frantic gesticulation, and<br/>broke down in the middle of it. A ghastly stage-fright seized him,<br/>his legs quaked under him and he was like to choke. True, he had<br/>the manifest sympathy of the house but he had the house's silence,<br/>too, which was even worse than its sympathy. The master frowned,<br/>and this completed the disaster. Tom struggled awhile and then<br/>retired, utterly defeated. There was a weak attempt at applause,<br/>but it died early.<br/><br/>"The Boy Stood on the Burning Deck" followed; also "The Assyrian<br/>Came Down," and other declamatory gems. Then there were reading<br/>exercises, and a spelling fight. The meagre Latin class recited<br/>with honor. The prime feature of the evening was in order, now —<br/>original "compositions" by the young ladies. Each in her turn<br/>stepped forward to the edge of the platform, cleared her throat,<br/>held up her manuscript (tied with dainty ribbon), and proceeded to<br/>read, with labored attention to "expression" and punctuation. The<br/>themes were the same that had been illuminated upon similar<br/>occasions by their mothers before them, their grandmothers, and<br/>doubtless all their ancestors in the female line clear back to the<br/>Crusades. "Friendship" was one; "Memories of Other Days"; "Religion<br/>in History"; "Dream Land"; "The Advantages of Culture"; "Forms of<br/>Political Government Compared and Contrasted"; "Melancholy";<br/>"Filial Love"; "Heart Longings," etc., etc.<br/><br/>A prevalent feature in these compositions was a nursed and<br/>petted melancholy; another was a wasteful and opulent gush of "fine<br/>language"; another was a tendency to lug in by the ears<br/>particularly prized words and phrases until they were worn entirely<br/>out; and a peculiarity that conspicuously marked and marred them<br/>was the inveterate and intolerable sermon that wagged its crippled<br/>tail at the end of each and every one of them. No matter what the<br/>subject might be, a brain-racking effort was made to squirm it into<br/>some aspect or other that the moral and religious mind could<br/>contemplate with edification. The glaring insincerity of these<br/>sermons was not sufficient to compass the banishment of the fashion<br/>from the schools, and it is not sufficient to-day; it never will be<br/>sufficient while the world stands, perhaps. There is no school in<br/>all our land where the young ladies do not feel obliged to close<br/>their compositions with a sermon; and you will find that the sermon<br/>of the most frivolous and the least religious girl in the school is<br/>always the longest and the most relentlessly pious. But enough of<br/>this. Homely truth is unpalatable.<br/><br/>
