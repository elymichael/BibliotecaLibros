"Guy of Guisborne wants no man's pass. Who art thou that — that
—"

"Dares to hold such language," said Tom, prompting — for they
talked "by the book," from memory.

"Who art thou that dares to hold such language?"

"I, indeed! I am Robin Hood, as thy caitiff carcase soon shall
know."

"Then art thou indeed that famous outlaw? Right gladly will I
dispute with thee the passes of the merry wood. Have at thee!"

They took their lath swords, dumped their other traps on the
ground, struck a fencing attitude, foot to foot, and began a grave,
careful combat, "two up and two down." Presently Tom said:

"Now, if you've got the hang, go it lively!"

So they "went it lively," panting and perspiring with the work.
By and by Tom shouted:

"Fall! fall! Why don't you fall?"

"I sha'n't! Why don't you fall yourself? You're getting the
worst of it."
