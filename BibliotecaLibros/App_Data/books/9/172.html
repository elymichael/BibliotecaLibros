<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>28<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>That night Tom and Huck were ready for their adventure. They<br/>hung about the neighborhood of the tavern until after nine, one<br/>watching the alley at a distance and the other the tavern door.<br/>Nobody entered the alley or left it; nobody resembling the Spaniard<br/>entered or left the tavern door. The night promised to be a fair<br/>one; so Tom went home with the understanding that if a considerable<br/>degree of darkness came on, Huck was to come and "maow," whereupon<br/>he would slip out and try the keys. But the night remained clear,<br/>and Huck closed his watch and retired to bed in an empty sugar<br/>hogshead about twelve. Tuesday the boys had the same ill luck. Also<br/>Wednesday. But Thursday night promised better. Tom slipped out in<br/>good season with his aunt's old tin lantern, and a large towel to<br/>blindfold it with. He hid the lantern in Huck's sugar hogshead and<br/>the watch began. An hour before midnight the tavern closed up and<br/>its lights (the only ones thereabouts) were put out. No Spaniard<br/>had been seen. Nobody had entered or left the alley. Everything was<br/>auspicious. The blackness of darkness reigned, the perfect<br/>stillness was interrupted only by occasional mutterings of distant<br/>thunder.<br/><br/>Tom got his lantern, lit it in the hogshead, wrapped it closely<br/>in the towel, and the two adventurers crept in the gloom toward the<br/>tavern. Huck stood sentry and Tom felt his way into the alley. Then<br/>there was a season of waiting anxiety that weighed upon Huck's<br/>spirits like a mountain. He began to wish he could see a flash from<br/>the lantern — it would frighten him, but it would at least tell him<br/>that Tom was alive yet. It seemed hours since Tom had disappeared.<br/>Surely he must have fainted; maybe he was dead; maybe his heart had<br/>burst under terror and excitement. In his uneasiness Huck found<br/>himself drawing closer and closer to the alley; fearing all sorts<br/>of dreadful things, and momentarily expecting some catastrophe to<br/>happen that would take away his breath. There was not much to take<br/>away, for he seemed only able to inhale it by thimblefuls, and his<br/>heart would soon wear itself out, the way it was beating. Suddenly<br/>there was a flash of light and Tom came tearing by him:<br/><br/>."Run!" said he; "run, for your life!"<br/><br/>He needn't have repeated it; once was enough; Huck was making<br/>thirty or forty miles an hour before the repetition was uttered.<br/>The boys never stopped till they reached the shed of a deserted<br/>slaughter-house at the lower end of the village. Just as they got<br/>within its shelter the storm burst and the rain poured down. As<br/>soon as Tom got his breath he said:<br/><br/>"Huck, it was awful! I tried two of the keys, just as soft as I<br/>could; but they seemed to make such a power of racket that I<br/>couldn't hardly get my breath I was so scared. They wouldn't turn<br/>in the lock, either. Well, without noticing what I was doing, I<br/>took hold of the knob, and open comes the door! It warn't locked! I<br/>hopped in, and shook off the towel, and, great Caesar's ghost!"<br/><br/>"What! — what'd you see, Tom?"<br/><br/>
