<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>8<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>Tom dodged hither and thither through lanes until he was well<br/>out of the track of returning scholars, and then fell into a moody<br/>jog. He crossed a small "branch" two or three times, because of a<br/>prevailing juvenile superstition that to cross water baffled<br/>pursuit. Half an hour later he was disappearing behind the Douglas<br/>mansion on the summit of Cardiff Hill, and the school-house was<br/>hardly distinguishable away off in the valley behind him. He<br/>entered a dense wood, picked his pathless way to the centre of it,<br/>and sat down on a mossy spot under a spreading oak. There was not<br/>even a zephyr stirring; the dead noonday heat had even stilled the<br/>songs of the birds; nature lay in a trance that was broken by no<br/>sound but the occasional far-off hammering of a woodpecker, and<br/>this seemed to render the pervading silence and sense of loneliness<br/>the more profound. The boy's soul was steeped in melancholy; his<br/>feelings were in happy accord with his surroundings. He sat long<br/>with his elbows on his knees and his chin in his hands, meditating.<br/>It seemed to him that life was but a trouble, at best, and he more<br/>than half envied Jimmy Hodges, so lately released; it must be very<br/>peaceful, he thought, to lie and slumber and dream forever and<br/>ever, with the wind whispering through the trees and caressing the<br/>grass and the flowers over the grave, and nothing to bother and<br/>grieve about, ever any more. If he only had a clean Sunday-school<br/>record he could be willing to go, and be done with it all. Now as<br/>to this girl. What had he done? Nothing. He had meant the best in<br/>the world, and been treated like a dog — like a very dog. She would<br/>be sorry some day — maybe when it was too late. Ah, if he could<br/>only die temporarily!<br/><br/>But the elastic heart of youth cannot be compressed into one<br/>constrained shape long at a time. Tom presently began to drift<br/>insensibly back into the concerns of this life again. What if he<br/>turned his back, now, and disappeared mysteriously? What if he went<br/>away — ever so far away, into unknown countries beyond the seas —<br/>and never came back any more! How would she feel then! The idea of<br/>being a clown recurred to him now, only to fill him with disgust.<br/>For frivolity and jokes and spotted tights were an offense, when<br/>they intruded themselves upon a spirit that was exalted into the<br/>vague august realm of the romantic. No, he would be a soldier, and<br/>return after long years, all war-worn and illustrious. No — better<br/>still, he would join the Indians, and hunt buffaloes and go on the<br/>warpath in the mountain ranges and the trackless great plains of<br/>the Far West, and away in the future come back a great chief,<br/>bristling with feathers, hideous with paint, and prance into<br/>Sunday-school, some drowsy summer morning, with a blood-curdling<br/>war-whoop, and sear the eyeballs of all his companions with<br/>unappeasable envy. But no, there was something gaudier even than<br/>this. He would be a pirate! That was it! Now his future lay plain<br/>before him, and glowing with unimaginable splendor. How his name<br/>would fill the world, and make people shudder! How gloriously he<br/>would go plowing the dancing seas, in his long, low, black-hulled<br/>racer, the Spirit of the Storm, with his grisly flag flying at the<br/>fore! And at the zenith of his fame, how he would suddenly appear<br/>at the old village and stalk into church, brown and weather-beaten,<br/>in his black velvet doublet and trunks, his great jack-boots, his<br/>crimson sash, his belt bristling with horse-pistols, his<br/>crime-rusted cutlass at his side, his slouch hat with waving<br/>plumes, his black flag unfurled, with the skull and crossbones on<br/>it, and hear with swelling ecstasy the whisperings, "It's Tom<br/>Sawyer the Pirate! — the Black Avenger of the Spanish Main!"<br/><br/>Yes, it was settled; his career was determined. He would run<br/>away from home and enter upon it. He would start the very next<br/>morning. Therefore he must now begin to get ready. He would collect<br/>his resources together. He went to a rotten log near at hand and<br/>began to dig under one end of it with his Barlow knife. He soon<br/>struck wood that sounded hollow. He put his hand there and uttered<br/>this incantation impressively:<br/><br/>"What hasn't come here, come! What's here, stay here!"<br/><br/>Then he scraped away the dirt, and exposed a pine shingle. He<br/>took it up and disclosed a shapely little treasure-house whose<br/>bottom and sides were of shingles. In it lay a marble. Tom's<br/>astonishment was boundless! He scratched his head with a perplexed<br/>air, and said:<br/><br/>"Well, that beats anything!"<br/><br/>
