<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>16<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>After dinner all the gang turned out to hunt for turtle eggs on<br/>the bar. They went about poking sticks into the sand, and when they<br/>found a soft place they went down on their knees and dug with their<br/>hands. Sometimes they would take fifty or sixty eggs out of one<br/>hole. They were perfectly round white things a trifle smaller than<br/>an English walnut. They had a famous fried-egg feast that night,<br/>and another on Friday morning.<br/><br/>After breakfast they went whooping and prancing out on the bar,<br/>and chased each other round and round, shedding clothes as they<br/>went, until they were naked, and then continued the frolic far away<br/>up the shoal water of the bar, against the stiff current, which<br/>latter tripped their legs from under them from time to time and<br/>greatly increased the fun. And now and then they stooped in a group<br/>and splashed water in each other's faces with their palms,<br/>gradually approaching each other, with averted faces to avoid the<br/>strangling sprays, and finally gripping and struggling till the<br/>best man ducked his neighbor, and then they all went under in a<br/>tangle of white legs and arms and came up blowing, sputtering,<br/>laughing, and gasping for breath at one and the same time.<br/><br/>When they were well exhausted, they would run out and sprawl on<br/>the dry, hot sand, and lie there and cover themselves up with it,<br/>and by and by break for the water again and go through the original<br/>performance once more. Finally it occurred to them that their naked<br/>skin represented flesh-colored "tights" very fairly; so they drew a<br/>ring in the sand and had a circus — with three clowns in it, for<br/>none would yield this proudest post to his neighbor.<br/><br/>Next they got their marbles and played "knucks" and "ring-taw"<br/>and "keeps" till that amusement grew stale. Then Joe and Huck had<br/>another swim, but Tom would not venture, because he found that in<br/>kicking off his trousers he had kicked his string of rattlesnake<br/>rattles off his ankle, and he wondered how he had escaped cramp so<br/>long without the protection of this mysterious charm. He did not<br/>venture again until he had found it, and by that time the other<br/>boys were tired and ready to rest. They gradually wandered apart,<br/>dropped into the "dumps," and fell to gazing longingly across the<br/>wide river to where the village lay drowsing in the sun. Tom found<br/>himself writing "Becky" in the sand with his big toe; he scratched<br/>it out, and was angry with himself for his weakness. But he wrote<br/>it again, nevertheless; he could not help it. He erased it once<br/>more and then took himself out of temptation by driving the other<br/>boys together and joining them.<br/><br/>But Joe's spirits had gone down almost beyond resurrection. He<br/>was so homesick that he could hardly endure the misery of it. The<br/>tears lay very near the surface. Huck was melancholy, too. Tom was<br/>downhearted, but tried hard not to show it. He had a secret which<br/>he was not ready to tell, yet, but if this mutinous depression was<br/>not broken up soon, he would have to bring it out. He said, with a<br/>great show of cheerfulness:<br/><br/>"I bet there's been pirates on this island before, boys. We'll<br/>explore it again. They've hid treasures here somewhere. How'd you<br/>feel to light on a rotten chest full of gold and silver — hey?"<br/><br/>
