"Oh, child, you never think. You never think of anything but<br/>your own selfishness. You could think to come all the way over here<br/>from Jackson's Island in the night to laugh at our troubles, and<br/>you could think to fool me with a lie about a dream; but you<br/>couldn't ever think to pity us and save us from sorrow."<br/><br/>"Auntie, I know now it was mean, but I didn't mean to be mean. I<br/>didn't, honest. And besides, I didn't come over here to laugh at<br/>you that night."<br/><br/>"What did you come for, then?"<br/><br/>"It was to tell you not to be uneasy about us, because we hadn't<br/>got drownded."<br/><br/>"Tom, Tom, I would be the thankfullest soul in this world if I<br/>could believe you ever had as good a thought as that, but you know<br/>you never did — and I know it, Tom."<br/><br/>"Indeed and 'deed I did, auntie — I wish I may never stir if I<br/>didn't."<br/><br/>"Oh, Tom, don't lie — don't do it. It only makes things a<br/>hundred times worse."<br/><br/>"It ain't a lie, auntie; it's the truth. I wanted to keep you<br/>from grieving — that was all that made me come."<br/><br/>"I'd give the whole world to believe that — it would cover up a<br/>power of sins, Tom. I'd 'most be glad you'd run off and acted so<br/>bad. But it ain't reasonable; because, why didn't you tell me,<br/>child?"<br/><br/>"Why, you see, when you got to talking about the funeral, I just<br/>got all full of the idea of our coming and hiding in the church,<br/>and I couldn't somehow bear to spoil it. So I just put the bark<br/>back in my pocket and kept mum."<br/><br/>"What bark?"<br/>
