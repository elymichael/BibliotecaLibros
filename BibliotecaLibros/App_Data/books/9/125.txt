tenderness dawned in her eyes.

"Did you kiss me, Tom?"

"Why, yes, I did."

"Are you sure you did, Tom?"

"What did you kiss me for, Tom?"

"Because I loved you so, and you laid there moaning and I was so
sorry."

The words sounded like truth. The old lady could not hide a
tremor in her voice when she said:

"Kiss me again, Tom! — and be off with you to school, now, and
don't bother me any more."
