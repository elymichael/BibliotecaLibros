<br/>The boys were there that night, about the appointed time. They<br/>sat in the shadow waiting. It was a lonely place, and an hour made<br/>solemn by old traditions. Spirits whispered in the rustling leaves,<br/>ghosts lurked in the murky nooks, the deep baying of a hound<br/>floated up out of the distance, an owl answered with his sepulchral<br/>note. The boys were subdued by these solemnities, and talked<br/>little. By and by they judged that twelve had come; they marked<br/>where the shadow fell, and began to dig. Their hopes commenced to<br/>rise. Their interest grew stronger, and their industry kept pace<br/>with it. The hole deepened and still deepened, but every time their<br/>hearts jumped to hear the pick strike upon something, they only<br/>suffered a new disappointment. It was only a stone or a chunk. At<br/>last Tom said:<br/><br/>"It ain't any use, Huck, we're wrong again."<br/><br/>"Well, but we can't be wrong. We spotted the shadder to a<br/>dot."<br/><br/>"I know it, but then there's another thing."<br/><br/>"What's that?".<br/><br/>"Why, we only guessed at the time. Like enough it was too late<br/>or too early."<br/><br/>Huck dropped his shovel.<br/><br/>"That's it," said he. "That's the very trouble. We got to give<br/>this one up. We can't ever tell the right time, and besides this<br/>kind of thing's too awful, here this time of night with witches and<br/>ghosts a-fluttering around so. I feel as if something's behind me<br/>all the time; and I'm afeard to turn around, becuz maybe there's<br/>others in front a-waiting for a chance. I been creeping all over,<br/>ever since I got here."<br/><br/>"Well, I've been pretty much so, too, Huck. They most always put<br/>in a dead man when they bury a treasure under a tree, to look out<br/>for it."<br/><br/>"Lordy!"<br/><br/>
