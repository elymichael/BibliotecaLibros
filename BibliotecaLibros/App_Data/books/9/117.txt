"As I'm sitting here, I did! Didn't I, Mary! Go on!"

"And then — and then — well I won't be certain, but it seems
like as if you made Sid go and — and —"

"Well? Well? What did I make him do, Tom? What did I make him
do?"

"You made him — you — Oh, you made him shut it."

"Well, for the land's sake! I never heard the beat of that in
all my days! Don't tell me there ain't anything in dreams, any
more. Sereny Harper shall know of this before I'm an hour older.
I'd like to see her get around this with her rubbage 'bout
superstition. Go on, Tom!"

"Oh, it's all getting just as bright as day, now. Next you said
I warn't bad, only mischeevous and harum-scarum, and not any more
responsible than — than — I think it was a colt, or something."

"And so it was! Well, goodness gracious! Go on, Tom!"

"And then you began to cry."

"So I did. So I did. Not the first time, neither. And then
—"

"Then Mrs. Harper she began to cry, and said Joe was just the
same, and she wished she hadn't whipped him for taking cream when
she'd throwed it out her own self —"

"Tom! The sperrit was upon you! You was a prophesying — that's
what you was doing! Land alive, go on, Tom!"
