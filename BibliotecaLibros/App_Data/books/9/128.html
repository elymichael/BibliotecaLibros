"Tom Sawyer, you are just as mean as you can be, to sneak up on<br/>a person and look at what they're looking at."<br/><br/>"How could I know you was looking at anything?"<br/><br/>"You ought to be ashamed of yourself, Tom Sawyer; you know<br/>you're going to tell on me, and oh, what shall I do, what shall I<br/>do! I'll be whipped, and I never was whipped in school."<br/><br/>Then she stamped her little foot and said:<br/><br/>"Be so mean if you want to! I know something that's going to<br/>happen. You just wait and you'll see! Hateful, hateful, hateful!" —<br/>and she flung out of the house with a new explosion of crying.<br/><br/>Tom stood still, rather flustered by this onslaught. Presently<br/>he said to himself:<br/><br/>"What a curious kind of a fool a girl is! Never been licked in<br/>school! Shucks! What's a licking! That's just like a girl — they're<br/>so thin-skinned and chicken-hearted. Well, of course I ain't going<br/>to tell old Dobbins on this little fool, because there's other ways<br/>of getting even on her, that ain't so mean; but what of it? Old<br/>Dobbins will ask who it was tore his book. Nobody'll answer. Then<br/>he'll do just the way he always does — ask first one and then<br/>t'other, and when he comes to the right girl he'll know it, without<br/>any telling. Girls' faces always tell on them. They ain't got any<br/>backbone. She'll get licked. Well, it's a kind of a tight place for<br/>Becky Thatcher, because there ain't any way out of it." Tom conned<br/>the thing a moment longer, and then added: "All right, though;<br/>she'd like to see me in just such a fix — let her sweat it<br/>out!"<br/><br/>Tom joined the mob of skylarking scholars outside. In a few<br/>moments the master arrived and school "took in." Tom did not feel a<br/>strong interest in his studies. Every time he stole a glance at the<br/>girls' side of the room Becky's face troubled him. Considering all<br/>things, he did not want to pity her, and yet it was all he could do<br/>to help it. He could get up no exultation that was really worthy<br/>the name. Presently the spelling-book discovery was made, and Tom's<br/>mind was entirely full of his own matters for a while after that.<br/>Becky roused up from her lethargy of distress and showed good<br/>interest in the proceedings. She did not expect that Tom could get<br/>out of his trouble by denying that he spilt the ink on the book<br/>himself; and she was right. The denial only seemed to make the<br/>thing worse for Tom. Becky supposed she would be glad of that, and<br/>she tried to believe she was glad of it, but she found she was not<br/>certain. When the worst came to the worst, she had an impulse to<br/>get up and tell on Alfred Temple, but she made an effort and forced<br/>herself to keep still — because, said she to herself, "he'll tell<br/>about me tearing the picture sure. I wouldn't say a word, not to<br/>save his life!"<br/><br/>Tom took his whipping and went back to his seat not at all<br/>broken-hearted, for he thought it was possible that he had<br/>unknowingly upset the ink on the spelling-book himself, in some<br/>skylarking bout — he had denied it for form's sake and because it<br/>was custom, and had stuck to the denial from principle.<br/><br/>A whole hour drifted by, the master sat nodding in his throne,<br/>the air was drowsy with the hum of study. By and by, Mr. Dobbins<br/>straightened himself up, yawned, then unlocked his desk, and<br/>reached for his book, but seemed undecided whether to take it out<br/>or leave it. Most of the pupils glanced up languidly, but there<br/>were two among them that watched his movements with intent eyes.<br/>Mr. Dobbins fingered his book absently for a while, then took it<br/>out and settled himself in his chair to read! Tom shot a glance at<br/>Becky. He had seen a hunted and helpless rabbit look as she did,<br/>with a gun levelled at its head. Instantly he forgot his quarrel<br/>with her. Quick — something must be done! done in a flash, too! But<br/>the very imminence of the emergency paralyzed his invention. Good!<br/>— he had an inspiration! He would run and snatch the book, spring<br/>through the door and fly. But his resolution shook for one little<br/>instant, and the chance was lost — the master opened the volume. If<br/>Tom only had the wasted opportunity back again! Too late. There was<br/>no help for Becky now, he said. The next moment the master faced<br/>the school. Every eye sank under his gaze. There was that in it<br/>which smote even the innocent with fear. There was silence while<br/>one might count ten — the master was gathering his wrath. Then he<br/>spoke: "Who tore this book?"<br/><br/>There was not a sound. One could have heard a pin drop. The<br/>stillness continued; the master searched face after face for signs<br/>of guilt.<br/>
