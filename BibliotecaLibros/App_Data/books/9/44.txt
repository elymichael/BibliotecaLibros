"Yes, that's it, Huck — that's it; though when you're burying it
if you say 'Down bean; off wart; come no more to bother me!' it's
better. That's the way Joe Harper does, and he's been nearly to
Coonville and most everywheres. But say — how do you cure 'em with
dead cats?"

"Why, you take your cat and go and get in the graveyard 'long
about midnight when somebody that was wicked has been buried; and
when it's midnight a devil will come, or maybe two or three, but
you can't see 'em, you can only hear something like the wind, or
maybe hear 'em talk; and when they're taking that feller away, you
heave your cat after 'em and say, 'Devil follow corpse, cat follow
devil, warts follow cat, I'm done with ye!' That'll fetch any
wart."

"Sounds right. D'you ever try it, Huck?"

"No, but old Mother Hopkins told me."

"Well, I reckon it's so, then. Becuz they say she's a
witch."

"Say! Why, Tom, I know she is. She witched pap. Pap says so his
own self. He come along one day, and he see she was a-witching him,
so he took up a rock, and if she hadn't dodged, he'd a got her.
Well, that very night he rolled off'n a shed wher' he was a layin
drunk, and broke his arm."

"Why, that's awful. How did he know she was a-witching him?"

"Lord, pap can tell, easy. Pap says when they keep looking at
you right stiddy, they're a-witching you. Specially if they mumble.
Becuz when they mumble they're saying the Lord's Prayer
backards."

"Say, Hucky, when you going to try the cat?"

"To-night. I reckon they'll come after old Hoss Williams
to-night."
