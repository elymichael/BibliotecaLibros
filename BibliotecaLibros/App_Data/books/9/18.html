"Oh, I dasn't, Mars Tom. Ole missis she'd take an' tar de head<br/>off'n me. 'Deed she would."<br/><br/>"She! She never licks anybody — whacks 'em over the head with<br/>her thimble — and who cares for that, I'd like to know. She talks<br/>awful, but talk don't hurt — anyways it don't if she don't cry.<br/>Jim, I'll give you a marvel. I'll give you a white alley!"<br/><br/>Jim began to waver.<br/><br/>"White alley, Jim! And it's a bully taw."<br/><br/>"My! Dat's a mighty gay marvel, I tell you! But Mars Tom I's<br/>powerful 'fraid ole missis —"<br/><br/>"And besides, if you will I'll show you my sore toe."<br/><br/>Jim was only human — this attraction was too much for him. He<br/>put down his pail, took the white alley, and bent over the toe with<br/>absorbing interest while the bandage was being unwound. In another<br/>moment he was flying down the street with his pail and a tingling<br/>rear, Tom was whitewashing with vigor, and Aunt Polly was retiring<br/>from the field with a slipper in her hand and triumph in her<br/>eye.<br/><br/>But Tom's energy did not last. He began to think of the fun he<br/>had planned for this day, and his sorrows multiplied. Soon the free<br/>boys would come tripping along on all sorts of delicious<br/>expeditions, and they would make a world of fun of him for having<br/>to work — the very thought of it burnt him like fire. He got out<br/>his worldly wealth and examined it — bits of toys, marbles, and<br/>trash; enough to buy an exchange of work, maybe, but not half<br/>enough to buy so much as half an hour of pure freedom. So he<br/>returned his straitened means to his pocket, and gave up the idea<br/>of trying to buy the boys. At this dark and hopeless moment an<br/>inspiration burst upon him! Nothing less than a great, magnificent<br/>inspiration.<br/><br/>He took up his brush and went tranquilly to work. Ben Rogers<br/>hove in sight presently — the very boy, of all boys, whose ridicule<br/>he had been dreading. Ben's gait was the hop-skip-and-jump — proof<br/>enough that his heart was light and his anticipations high. He was<br/>eating an apple, and giving a long, melodious whoop, at intervals,<br/>followed by a deep-toned ding-dong-dong, ding-dong-dong, for he was<br/>personating a steamboat. As he drew near, he slackened speed, took<br/>the middle of the street, leaned far over to starboard and rounded<br/>to ponderously and with laborious pomp and circumstance — for he<br/>was personating the Big Missouri, and considered himself to be<br/>drawing nine feet of water. He was boat and captain and<br/>engine-bells combined, so he had to imagine himself standing on his<br/>own hurricane-deck giving the orders and executing them:<br/><br/>"Stop her, sir! Ting-a-ling-ling!" The headway ran almost out,<br/>and he drew up slowly toward the sidewalk.<br/><br/>"Ship up to back! Ting-a-ling-ling!" His arms straightened and<br/>stiffened down his sides.<br/>
