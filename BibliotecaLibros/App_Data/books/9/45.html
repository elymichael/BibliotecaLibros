Devils don't slosh around much of a Sunday, I<br/>don't reckon."<br/><br/>"I never thought of that. That's so. Lemme go with you?"<br/><br/>"Of course — if you ain't afeard."<br/><br/>"Afeard! 'Tain't likely. Will you meow?"<br/><br/>"Yes — and you meow back, if you get a chance. Last time, you<br/>kep' me a-meowing around till old Hays went to throwing rocks at me<br/>and says 'Dern that cat!' and so I hove a brick through his window<br/>— but don't you tell."<br/><br/>"I won't. I couldn't meow that night, becuz auntie was watching<br/>me, but I'll meow this time. Say — what's that?"<br/><br/>"Nothing but a tick."<br/><br/>"Where'd you get him?"<br/><br/>"Out in the woods."<br/><br/>"What'll you take for him?"<br/>
