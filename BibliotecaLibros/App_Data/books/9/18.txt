"Oh, I dasn't, Mars Tom. Ole missis she'd take an' tar de head
off'n me. 'Deed she would."

"She! She never licks anybody — whacks 'em over the head with
her thimble — and who cares for that, I'd like to know. She talks
awful, but talk don't hurt — anyways it don't if she don't cry.
Jim, I'll give you a marvel. I'll give you a white alley!"

Jim began to waver.

"White alley, Jim! And it's a bully taw."

"My! Dat's a mighty gay marvel, I tell you! But Mars Tom I's
powerful 'fraid ole missis —"

"And besides, if you will I'll show you my sore toe."

Jim was only human — this attraction was too much for him. He
put down his pail, took the white alley, and bent over the toe with
absorbing interest while the bandage was being unwound. In another
moment he was flying down the street with his pail and a tingling
rear, Tom was whitewashing with vigor, and Aunt Polly was retiring
from the field with a slipper in her hand and triumph in her
eye.

But Tom's energy did not last. He began to think of the fun he
had planned for this day, and his sorrows multiplied. Soon the free
boys would come tripping along on all sorts of delicious
expeditions, and they would make a world of fun of him for having
to work — the very thought of it burnt him like fire. He got out
his worldly wealth and examined it — bits of toys, marbles, and
trash; enough to buy an exchange of work, maybe, but not half
enough to buy so much as half an hour of pure freedom. So he
returned his straitened means to his pocket, and gave up the idea
of trying to buy the boys. At this dark and hopeless moment an
inspiration burst upon him! Nothing less than a great, magnificent
inspiration.

He took up his brush and went tranquilly to work. Ben Rogers
hove in sight presently — the very boy, of all boys, whose ridicule
he had been dreading. Ben's gait was the hop-skip-and-jump — proof
enough that his heart was light and his anticipations high. He was
eating an apple, and giving a long, melodious whoop, at intervals,
followed by a deep-toned ding-dong-dong, ding-dong-dong, for he was
personating a steamboat. As he drew near, he slackened speed, took
the middle of the street, leaned far over to starboard and rounded
to ponderously and with laborious pomp and circumstance — for he
was personating the Big Missouri, and considered himself to be
drawing nine feet of water. He was boat and captain and
engine-bells combined, so he had to imagine himself standing on his
own hurricane-deck giving the orders and executing them:

"Stop her, sir! Ting-a-ling-ling!" The headway ran almost out,
and he drew up slowly toward the sidewalk.

"Ship up to back! Ting-a-ling-ling!" His arms straightened and
stiffened down his sides.
