Early in the forenoon parties of jaded men began to straggle<br/>into the village, but the strongest of the citizens continued<br/>searching. All the news that could be gained was that remotenesses<br/>of the cavern were being ransacked that had never been visited<br/>before; that every corner and crevice was going to be thoroughly<br/>searched; that wherever one wandered through the maze of passages,<br/>lights were to be seen flitting hither and thither in the distance,<br/>and shoutings and pistol-shots sent their hollow reverberations to<br/>the ear down the sombre aisles. In one place, far from the section<br/>usually traversed by tourists, the names "Becky &amp; Tom" had been<br/>found traced upon the rocky wall with candle-smoke, and near at<br/>hand a grease-soiled bit of ribbon. Mrs. Thatcher recognized the<br/>ribbon and cried over it. She said it was the last relic she should<br/>ever have of her child; and that no other memorial of her could<br/>ever be so precious, because this one parted latest from the living<br/>body before the awful death came. Some said that now and then, in<br/>the cave, a far-away speck of light would glimmer, and then a<br/>glorious shout would burst forth and a score of men go trooping<br/>down the echoing aisle — and then a sickening disappointment always<br/>followed; the children were not there; it was only a searcher's<br/>light.<br/><br/>Three dreadful days and nights dragged their tedious hours<br/>along, and the village sank into a hopeless stupor. No one had<br/>heart for anything. The accidental discovery, just made, that the<br/>proprietor of the Temperance Tavern kept liquor on his premises,<br/>scarcely fluttered the public pulse, tremendous as the fact was. In<br/>a lucid interval, Huck feebly led up to the subject of taverns, and<br/>finally asked — dimly dreading the worst — if anything had been<br/>discovered at the Temperance Tavern since he had been ill.<br/><br/>"Yes," said the widow.<br/><br/>Huck started up in bed, wild-eyed:<br/><br/>"What? What was it?"<br/><br/>"Liquor! — and the place has been shut up. Lie down, child —<br/>what a turn you did give me!"<br/><br/>"Only tell me just one thing — only just one — please! Was it<br/>Tom Sawyer that found it?"<br/><br/>The widow burst into tears. "Hush, hush, child, hush! I've told<br/>you before, you must not talk. You are very, very sick!"<br/><br/>Then nothing but liquor had been found; there would have been a<br/>great powwow if it had been the gold. So the treasure was gone<br/>forever — gone forever! But what could she be crying about? Curious<br/>that she should cry.<br/><br/>These thoughts worked their dim way through Huck's mind, and<br/>under the weariness they gave him he fell asleep. The widow said to<br/>herself:<br/><br/>"There — he's asleep, poor wreck. Tom Sawyer find it! Pity but<br/>somebody could find Tom Sawyer! Ah, there ain't many left, now,<br/>that's got hope enough, or strength enough, either, to go on<br/>searching."<br/>
