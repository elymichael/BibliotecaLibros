The point was well taken. It had its effect.

"Tom, I didn't think of that. But that's so. It's luck for us,
that cross is. I reckon we'll climb down there and have a hunt for
that box."

Tom went first, cutting rude steps in the clay hill as he
descended. Huck followed. Four avenues opened out of the small
cavern which the great rock stood in. The boys examined three of
them with no result. They found a small recess in the one nearest
the base of the rock, with a pallet of blankets spread down in it;
also an old suspender, some bacon rind, and the well-gnawed bones

rift. He proposed to explore. He stooped and passed under; the
narrow way descended gradually. He followed its winding course,
first to the right, then to the left, Huck at his heels. Tom turned
a short curve, by-and-by, and exclaimed:
