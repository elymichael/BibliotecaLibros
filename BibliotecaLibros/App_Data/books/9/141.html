<br/>"Take the witness."<br/><br/>Counsel for Potter declined to question him. The faces of the<br/>audience began to betray annoyance. Did this attorney mean to throw<br/>away his client's life without an effort?<br/><br/>Several witnesses deposed concerning Potter's guilty behavior<br/>when brought to the scene of the murder. They were allowed to leave<br/>the stand without being cross-questioned.<br/><br/>Every detail of the damaging circumstances that occurred in the<br/>graveyard upon that morning which all present remembered so well<br/>was brought out by credible witnesses, but none of them were<br/>cross-examined by Potter's lawyer.

Every eye fastened itself with wondering<br/>interest upon Tom as he rose and took his place upon the stand. The<br/>boy looked wild enough, for he was badly scared. The oath was<br/>administered.<br/><br/>"Thomas Sawyer, where were you on the seventeenth of June, about<br/>the hour of midnight?"<br/><br/>Tom glanced at Injun Joe's iron face and his tongue failed him.<br/>The audience listened breathless, but the words refused to come.<br/>After a few moments, however, the boy got a little of his strength<br/>back, and managed to put enough of it into his voice to make part<br/>of the house hear:<br/><br/>
