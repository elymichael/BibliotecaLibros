<br/>Mrs. Thatcher shook her head feebly and turned paler than<br/>ever.<br/><br/>"He didn't stay with us," said Mrs. Harper, beginning to look<br/>uneasy. A marked anxiety came into Aunt Polly's face.<br/><br/>"Joe Harper, have you seen my Tom this morning?"<br/><br/>"No'm."<br/><br/>"When did you see him last?"<br/><br/>Joe tried to remember, but was not sure he could say. The people<br/>had stopped moving out of church. Whispers passed along, and a<br/>boding uneasiness took possession of every countenance. Children<br/>were anxiously questioned, and young teachers. They all said they<br/>had not noticed whether Tom and Becky were on board the ferryboat<br/>on the homeward trip; it was dark; no one thought of inquiring if<br/>any one was missing. One young man finally blurted out his fear<br/>that they were still in the cave! Mrs. Thatcher swooned away. Aunt<br/>Polly fell to crying and wringing her hands.<br/><br/>The alarm swept from lip to lip, from group to group, from<br/>street to street, and within five minutes the bells were wildly<br/>clanging and the whole town was up! The Cardiff Hill episode sank<br/>into instant insignificance, the burglars were forgotten, horses<br/>were saddled, skiffs were manned, the ferryboat ordered out, and<br/>before the horror was half an hour old, two hundred men were<br/>pouring down highroad and river toward the cave.<br/><br/>All the long afternoon the village seemed empty and dead. Many<br/>women visited Aunt Polly and Mrs. Thatcher and tried to comfort<br/>them. They cried with them, too, and that was still better than<br/>words. All the tedious night the town waited for news; but when the<br/>morning dawned at last, all the word that came was, "Send more<br/>candles â€” and send food." Mrs. Thatcher was almost crazed; and Aunt<br/>Polly, also. Judge Thatcher sent messages of hope and encouragement<br/>from the cave, but they conveyed no real cheer.<br/><br/>The old Welshman came home toward daylight, spattered with<br/>candle-grease, smeared with clay, and almost worn out. He found<br/>Huck still in the bed that had been provided for him, and delirious<br/>with fever. The physicians were all at the cave, so the Widow<br/>Douglas came and took charge of the patient. She said she would do<br/>her best by him, because, whether he was good, bad, or indifferent,<br/>he was the Lord's, and nothing that was the Lord's was a thing to<br/>be neglected. The Welshman said Huck had good spots in him, and the<br/>widow said:<br/><br/>"You can depend on it. That's the Lord's mark. He don't leave it<br/>off. He never does. Puts it somewhere on every creature that comes<br/>from his hands."<br/><br/>
