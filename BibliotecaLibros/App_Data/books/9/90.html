<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>13<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>Tom's mind was made up now. He was gloomy and desperate. He was<br/>a forsaken, friendless boy, he said; nobody loved him; when they<br/>found out what they had driven him to, perhaps they would be sorry;<br/>he had tried to do right and get along, but they would not let him;<br/>since nothing would do them but to be rid of him, let it be so; and<br/>let them blame him for the consequences — why shouldn't they? What<br/>right had the friendless to complain? Yes, they had forced him to<br/>it at last: he would lead a life of crime. There was no choice.<br/><br/>By this time he was far down Meadow Lane, and the bell for<br/>school to "take up" tinkled faintly upon his ear. He sobbed, now,<br/>to think he should never, never hear that old familiar sound any<br/>more — it was very hard, but it was forced on him; since he was<br/>driven out into the cold world, he must submit — but he forgave<br/>them. Then the sobs came thick and fast.<br/><br/>Just at this point he met his soul's sworn comrade, Joe Harper —<br/>hard-eyed, and with evidently a great and dismal purpose in his<br/>heart. Plainly here were "two souls with but a single thought."<br/>Tom, wiping his eyes with his sleeve, began to blubber out<br/>something about a resolution to escape from hard usage and lack of<br/>sympathy at home by roaming abroad into the great world never to<br/>return; and ended by hoping that Joe would not forget him.<br/><br/>But it transpired that this was a request which Joe had just<br/>been going to make of Tom, and had come to hunt him up for that<br/>purpose. His mother had whipped him for drinking some cream which<br/>he had never tasted and knew nothing about; it was plain that she<br/>was tired of him and wished him to go; if she felt that way, there<br/>was nothing for him to do but succumb; he hoped she would be happy,<br/>and never regret having driven her poor boy out into the unfeeling<br/>world to suffer and die.<br/><br/>As the two boys walked sorrowing along, they made a new compact<br/>to stand by each other and be brothers and never separate till<br/>death relieved them of their troubles. Then they began to lay their<br/>plans. Joe was for being a hermit, and living on crusts in a remote<br/>cave, and dying, some time, of cold and want and grief; but after<br/>listening to Tom, he conceded that there were some conspicuous<br/>advantages about a life of crime, and so he consented to be a<br/>pirate.<br/><br/>Three miles below St. Petersburg, at a point where the<br/>Mississippi River was a trifle over a mile wide, there was a long,<br/>narrow, wooded island, with a shallow bar at the head of it, and<br/>this offered well as a rendezvous. It was not inhabited; it lay far<br/>over toward the further shore, abreast a dense and almost wholly<br/>unpeopled forest. So Jackson's Island was chosen. Who were to be<br/>the subjects of their piracies was a matter that did not occur to<br/>them. Then they hunted up Huckleberry Finn, and he joined them<br/>promptly, for all careers were one to him; he was indifferent. They<br/>presently separated to meet at a lonely spot on the river-bank two<br/>miles above the village at the favorite hour — which was midnight.<br/>There was a small log raft there which they meant to capture. Each<br/>would bring hooks and lines, and such provision as he could steal<br/>in the most dark and mysterious way — as became outlaws. And before<br/>the afternoon was done, they had all managed to enjoy the sweet<br/>glory of spreading the fact that pretty soon the town would "hear<br/>something." All who got this vague hint were cautioned to "be mum<br/>and wait."<br/><br/>
