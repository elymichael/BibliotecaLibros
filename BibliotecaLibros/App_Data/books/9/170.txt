"Oh, that's the trick! They ain't only two taverns. We can find
out quick."

"You stay here, Huck, till I come."

Tom was off at once. He did not care to have Huck's company in
public places. He was gone half an hour. He found that in the best
tavern, No. 2 had long been occupied by a young lawyer, and was
still so occupied. In the less ostentatious house, No. 2 was a
mystery. The tavern-keeper's young son said it was kept locked all
the time, and he never saw anybody go into it or come out of it
except at night; he did not know any particular reason for this
state of things; had had some little curiosity, but it was rather
feeble; had made the most of the mystery by entertaining himself
with the idea that that room was "ha'nted"; had noticed that there
was a light in there the night before.

"That's what I've found out, Huck. I reckon that's the very No.
2 we're after."

"I reckon it is, Tom. Now what you going to do?"

"Lemme think."

Tom thought a long time. Then he said:

"I'll tell you. The back door of that No. 2 is the door that
comes out into that little close alley between the tavern and the
old rattle trap of a brick store. Now you get hold of all the
door-keys you can find, and I'll nip all of auntie's, and the first
dark night we'll go there and try 'em. And mind you, keep a lookout
for Injun Joe, because he said he was going to drop into town and
spy around once more for a chance to get his revenge. If you see
him, you just follow him; and if he don't go to that No. 2, that
ain't the place."

"Lordy, I don't want to foller him by myself!"

"Why, it'll be night, sure. He mightn't ever see you â€” and if he
did, maybe he'd never think anything."
