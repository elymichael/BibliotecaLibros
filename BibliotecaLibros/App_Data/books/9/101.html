<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>15<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>A few minutes later Tom was in the shoal water of the bar,<br/>wading toward the Illinois shore. Before the depth reached his<br/>middle he was half-way over; the current would permit no more<br/>wading, now, so he struck out confidently to swim the remaining<br/>hundred yards. He swam quartering upstream, but still was swept<br/>downward rather faster than he had expected. However, he reached<br/>the shore finally, and drifted along till he found a low place and<br/>drew himself out. He put his hand on his jacket pocket, found his<br/>piece of bark safe, and then struck through the woods, following<br/>the shore, with streaming garments. Shortly before ten o'clock he<br/>came out into an open place opposite the village, and saw the<br/>ferryboat lying in the shadow of the trees and the high bank.<br/>Everything was quiet under the blinking stars. He crept down the<br/>bank, watching with all his eyes, slipped into the water, swam<br/>three or four strokes and climbed into the skiff that did "yawl"<br/>duty at the boat's stern. He laid himself down under the thwarts<br/>and waited, panting.<br/><br/>Presently the cracked bell tapped and a voice gave the order to<br/>"cast off." A minute or two later the skiff's head was standing<br/>high up, against the boat's swell, and the voyage was begun. Tom<br/>felt happy in his success, for he knew it was the boat's last trip<br/>for the night. At the end of a long twelve or fifteen minutes the<br/>wheels stopped, and Tom slipped overboard and swam ashore in the<br/>dusk, landing fifty yards downstream, out of danger of possible<br/>stragglers.<br/><br/>He flew along unfrequented alleys, and shortly found himself at<br/>his aunt's back fence. He climbed over, approached the "ell," and<br/>looked in at the sitting-room window, for a light was burning<br/>there. There sat Aunt Polly, Sid, Mary, and Joe Harper's mother,<br/>grouped together, talking. They were by the bed, and the bed was<br/>between them and the door. Tom went to the door and began to softly<br/>lift the latch; then he pressed gently and the door yielded a<br/>crack; he continued pushing cautiously, and quaking every time it<br/>creaked, till he judged he might squeeze through on his knees; so<br/>he put his head through and began, warily.<br/><br/>"What makes the candle blow so?" said Aunt Polly. Tom hurried<br/>up. "Why, that door's open, I believe. Why, of course it is. No end<br/>of strange things now. Go 'long and shut it, Sid."<br/><br/>Tom disappeared under the bed just in time. He lay and<br/>"breathed" himself for a time, and then crept to where he could<br/>almost touch his aunt's foot.<br/><br/>"But as I was saying," said Aunt Polly, "he warn't bad, so to<br/>say — only mischeevous. Only just giddy, and harum-scarum, you<br/>know. He warn't any more responsible than a colt. He never meant<br/>any harm, and he was the best-hearted boy that ever was" — and she<br/>began to cry.<br/><br/>
