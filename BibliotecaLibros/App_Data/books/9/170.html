<br/>"Oh, that's the trick! They ain't only two taverns. We can find<br/>out quick."<br/><br/>"You stay here, Huck, till I come."<br/><br/>Tom was off at once. He did not care to have Huck's company in<br/>public places. He was gone half an hour. He found that in the best<br/>tavern, No. 2 had long been occupied by a young lawyer, and was<br/>still so occupied. In the less ostentatious house, No. 2 was a<br/>mystery. The tavern-keeper's young son said it was kept locked all<br/>the time, and he never saw anybody go into it or come out of it<br/>except at night; he did not know any particular reason for this<br/>state of things; had had some little curiosity, but it was rather<br/>feeble; had made the most of the mystery by entertaining himself<br/>with the idea that that room was "ha'nted"; had noticed that there<br/>was a light in there the night before.<br/><br/>"That's what I've found out, Huck. I reckon that's the very No.<br/>2 we're after."<br/><br/>"I reckon it is, Tom. Now what you going to do?"<br/><br/>"Lemme think."<br/><br/>Tom thought a long time. Then he said:<br/><br/>"I'll tell you. The back door of that No. 2 is the door that<br/>comes out into that little close alley between the tavern and the<br/>old rattle trap of a brick store. Now you get hold of all the<br/>door-keys you can find, and I'll nip all of auntie's, and the first<br/>dark night we'll go there and try 'em. And mind you, keep a lookout<br/>for Injun Joe, because he said he was going to drop into town and<br/>spy around once more for a chance to get his revenge. If you see<br/>him, you just follow him; and if he don't go to that No. 2, that<br/>ain't the place."<br/><br/>"Lordy, I don't want to foller him by myself!"<br/><br/>"Why, it'll be night, sure. He mightn't ever see you â€” and if he<br/>did, maybe he'd never think anything."<br/><br/>
