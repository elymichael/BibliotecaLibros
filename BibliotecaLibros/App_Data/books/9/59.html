"Becky, I — I don't care for anybody but you."<br/><br/>No reply — but sobs.<br/><br/>"Becky" — pleadingly. "Becky, won't you say something?"<br/><br/>More sobs.<br/><br/>Tom got out his chiefest jewel, a brass knob from the top of an<br/>andiron, and passed it around her so that she could see it, and<br/>said:<br/><br/>"Please, Becky, won't you take it?"<br/><br/>She struck it to the floor. Then Tom marched out of the house<br/>and over the hills and far away, to return to school no more that<br/>day. Presently Becky began to suspect. She ran to the door; he was<br/>not in sight; she flew around to the play-yard; he was not there.<br/>Then she called:<br/><br/>"Tom! Come back, Tom!"<br/><br/>She listened intently, but there was no answer. She had no<br/>companions but silence and loneliness. So she sat down to cry again<br/>and upbraid herself; and by this time the scholars began to gather<br/>again, and she had to hide her griefs and still her broken heart<br/>and take up the cross of a long, dreary, aching afternoon, with<br/>none among the strangers about her to exchange sorrows with.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
