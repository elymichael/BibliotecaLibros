<br/>"And kill them?"<br/><br/>"No, not always. Hive them in the cave till they raise a<br/>ransom."<br/><br/>"What's a ransom?"<br/><br/>"Money. You make them raise all they can, off'n their friends;<br/>and after you've kept them a year, if it ain't raised then you kill<br/>them. That's the general way. Only you don't kill the women.

He showed Huck the fragment of candle-wick perched<br/>on a lump of clay against the wall, and described how he and Becky<br/>had watched the flame struggle and expire.<br/><br/>The boys began to quiet down to whispers, now, for the stillness<br/>and gloom of the place oppressed their spirits. They went on, and<br/>presently entered and followed Tom's other corridor until they<br/>reached the "jumping-off place." The candles revealed the fact that<br/>it was not really a precipice, but only a steep clay hill twenty or<br/>thirty feet high. Tom whispered:<br/><br/>"Now I'll show you something, Huck."<br/><br/>He held his candle aloft and said:<br/><br/>
