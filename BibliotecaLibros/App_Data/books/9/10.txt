"Bother! Well, go 'long with you. I'd made sure you'd played
hookey and been a-swimming. But I forgive ye, Tom. I reckon you're
a kind of a singed cat, as the saying is — better'n you look. This
time."

She was half sorry her sagacity had miscarried, and half glad
that Tom had stumbled into obedient conduct for once.

But Sidney said:

"Well, now, if I didn't think you sewed his collar with white
thread, but it's black."

"Why, I did sew it with white! Tom!"

But Tom did not wait for the rest. As he went out at the door he
said:

"Siddy, I'll lick you for that."

In a safe place Tom examined two large needles which were thrust
into the lapels of his jacket, and had thread bound about them —
one needle carried white thread and the other black. He said:

"She'd never noticed if it hadn't been for Sid. Confound it!
sometimes she sews it with white, and sometimes she sews it with
black. I wish to geeminy she'd stick to one or t'other — I can't
keep the run of 'em. But I bet you I'll lam Sid for that. I'll
learn him!"

He was not the Model Boy of the village. He knew the model boy
very well though — and loathed him.
