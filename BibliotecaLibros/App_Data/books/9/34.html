<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>5<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>About half-past ten the cracked bell of the small church began<br/>to ring, and presently the people began to gather for the morning<br/>sermon. The Sunday-school children distributed themselves about the<br/>house and occupied pews with their parents, so as to be under<br/>supervision. Aunt Polly came, and Tom and Sid and Mary sat with her<br/>— Tom being placed next the aisle, in order that he might be as far<br/>away from the open window and the seductive outside summer scenes<br/>as possible. The crowd filed up the aisles: the aged and needy<br/>postmaster, who had seen better days; the mayor and his wife — for<br/>they had a mayor there, among other unnecessaries; the justice of<br/>the peace; the widow Douglass, fair, smart, and forty, a generous,<br/>good-hearted soul and well-to-do, her hill mansion the only palace<br/>in the town, and the most hospitable and much the most lavish in<br/>the matter of festivities that St. Petersburg could boast; the bent<br/>and venerable Major and Mrs. Ward; lawyer Riverson, the new notable<br/>from a distance; next the belle of the village, followed by a troop<br/>of lawn-clad and ribbon-decked young heart-breakers; then all the<br/>young clerks in town in a body — for they had stood in the<br/>vestibule sucking their cane-heads, a circling wall of oiled and<br/>simpering admirers, till the last girl had run their gantlet; and<br/>last of all came the Model Boy, Willie Mufferson, taking as heedful<br/>care of his mother as if she were cut glass. He always brought his<br/>mother to church, and was the pride of all the matrons. The boys<br/>all hated him, he was so good. And besides, he had been "thrown up<br/>to them" so much. His white handkerchief was hanging out of his<br/>pocket behind, as usual on Sundays — accidentally. Tom had no<br/>handkerchief, and he looked upon boys who had as snobs.<br/><br/>The congregation being fully assembled, now, the bell rang once<br/>more, to warn laggards and stragglers, and then a solemn hush fell<br/>upon the church which was only broken by the tittering and<br/>whispering of the choir in the gallery. The choir always tittered<br/>and whispered all through service. There was once a church choir<br/>that was not ill-bred, but I have forgotten where it was, now. It<br/>was a great many years ago, and I can scarcely remember anything<br/>about it, but I think it was in some foreign country.<br/><br/>The minister gave out the hymn, and read it through with a<br/>relish, in a peculiar style which was much admired in that part of<br/>the country. His voice began on a medium key and climbed steadily<br/>up till it reached a certain point, where it bore with strong<br/>emphasis upon the topmost word and then plunged down as if from a<br/>spring-board:<br/><br/>Shall I be car-ri-ed toe the skies, on flow'ry beds<br/><br/>of ease,<br/><br/>Whilst others fight to win the prize, and sail thro' bloody<br/>seas?<br/><br/>
