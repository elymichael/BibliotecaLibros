"Follered 'em — yes. That was it. I wanted to see what was up —
they sneaked along so. I dogged 'em to the widder's stile, and
stood in the dark and heard the ragged one beg for the widder, and
the Spaniard swear he'd spile her looks just as I told you and your
two —"

"What! The deaf and dumb man said all that!"

Huck had made another terrible mistake! He was trying his best
to keep the old man from getting the faintest hint of who the
Spaniard might be, and yet his tongue seemed determined to get him
into trouble in spite of all he could do. He made several efforts
to creep out of his scrape, but the old man's eye was upon him and

Huck looked into the old man's honest eyes a moment, then bent
over and whispered in his ear:

"'Tain't a Spaniard — it's Injun Joe!"

The Welshman almost jumped out of his chair. In a moment he
said:

"It's all plain enough, now. When you talked about notching ears
and slitting noses I judged that that was your own embellishment,
because white men don't take that sort of revenge. But an Injun!
That's a different matter altogether."

During breakfast the talk went on, and in the course of it the
old man said that the last thing which he and his sons had done,
before going to bed, was to get a lantern and examine the stile and
its vicinity for marks of blood. They found none, but captured a
bulky bundle of —

"Of what?"

If the words had been lightning they could not have leaped with
a more stunning suddenness from Huck's blanched lips. His eyes were
staring wide, now, and his breath suspended — waiting for the
answer. The Welshman started — stared in return — three seconds —
five seconds — ten — then replied:
