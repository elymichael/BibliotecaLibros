A phrenologist and a mesmerizer came — and went again and left<br/>the village duller and drearier than ever.<br/><br/>There were some boys-and-girls' parties, but they were so few<br/>and so delightful that they only made the aching voids between ache<br/>the harder.<br/><br/>Becky Thatcher was gone to her Constantinople home to stay with<br/>her parents during vacation — so there was no bright side to life<br/>anywhere.<br/><br/>The dreadful secret of the murder was a chronic misery. It was a<br/>very cancer for permanency and pain.<br/><br/>Then came the measles.<br/><br/>During two long weeks Tom lay a prisoner, dead to the world and<br/>its happenings. He was very ill, he was interested in nothing. When<br/>he got upon his feet at last and moved feebly down-town, a<br/>melancholy change had come over everything and every creature.<br/>There had been a "revival," and everybody had "got religion," not<br/>only the adults, but even the boys and girls. Tom went about,<br/>hoping against hope for the sight of one blessed sinful face, but<br/>disappointment crossed him everywhere. He found Joe Harper studying<br/>a Testament, and turned sadly away from the depressing spectacle.<br/>He sought Ben Rogers, and found him visiting the poor with a basket<br/>of tracts. He hunted up Jim Hollis, who called his attention to the<br/>precious blessing of his late measles as a warning. Every boy he<br/>encountered added another ton to his depression; and when, in<br/>desperation, he flew for refuge at last to the bosom of Huckleberry<br/>Finn and was received with a Scriptural quotation, his heart broke<br/>and he crept home and to bed realizing that he alone of all the<br/>town was lost, forever and forever.<br/><br/>And that night there came on a terrific storm, with driving<br/>rain, awful claps of thunder and blinding sheets of lightning. He<br/>covered his head with the bedclothes and waited in a horror of<br/>suspense for his doom; for he had not the shadow of a doubt that<br/>all this hubbub was about him. He believed he had taxed the<br/>forbearance of the powers above to the extremity of endurance and<br/>that this was the result. It might have seemed to him a waste of<br/>pomp and ammunition to kill a bug with a battery of artillery, but<br/>there seemed nothing incongruous about the getting up such an<br/>expensive thunderstorm as this to knock the turf from under an<br/>insect like himself.<br/><br/>By and by the tempest spent itself and died without<br/>accomplishing its object. The boy's first impulse was to be<br/>grateful, and reform. His second was to wait — for there might not<br/>be any more storms.<br/><br/>The next day the doctors were back; Tom had relapsed. The three<br/>weeks he spent on his back this time seemed an entire age. When he<br/>got abroad at last he was hardly grateful that he had been spared,<br/>remembering how lonely was his estate, how companionless and<br/>forlorn he was. He drifted listlessly down the street and found Jim<br/>Hollis acting as judge in a juvenile court that was trying a cat<br/>for murder, in the presence of her victim, a bird. He found Joe<br/>Harper and Huck Finn up an alley eating a stolen melon. Poor lads!<br/>they — like Tom — had suffered a relapse.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
