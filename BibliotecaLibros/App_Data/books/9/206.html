"My goodness, Huck, lookyhere!"<br/><br/>It was the treasure-box, sure enough, occupying a snug little<br/>cavern, along with an empty powder-keg, a couple of guns in leather<br/>cases, two or three pairs of old moccasins, a leather belt, and<br/>some other rubbish well soaked with the water-drip.<br/><br/>"Got it at last!" said Huck, ploughing among the tarnished coins<br/>with his hand. "My, but we're rich, Tom!"<br/><br/>"Huck, I always reckoned we'd get it. It's just too good to<br/>believe, but we have got it, sure! Say — let's not fool around<br/>here. Let's snake it out. Lemme see if I can lift the box."<br/><br/>It weighed about fifty pounds. Tom could lift it, after an<br/>awkward fashion, but could not carry it conveniently.<br/><br/>"I thought so," he said; "They carried it like it was heavy,<br/>that day at the ha'nted house. I noticed that. I reckon I was right<br/>to think of fetching the little bags along."<br/><br/>The money was soon in the bags and the boys took it up to the<br/>cross rock.<br/><br/>"Now less fetch the guns and things," said Huck.<br/><br/>"No, Huck — leave them there. They're just the tricks to have<br/>when we go to robbing. We'll keep them there all the time, and<br/>we'll hold our orgies there, too. It's an awful snug place for<br/>orgies."<br/><br/>"What orgies?"<br/><br/>"I dono. But robbers always have orgies, and of course we've got<br/>to have them, too. Come along, Huck, we've been in here a long<br/>time. It's getting late, I reckon. I'm hungry, too. We'll eat and<br/>smoke when we get to the skiff."<br/>
