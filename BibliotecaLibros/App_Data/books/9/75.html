He at once took a pin<br/>from his lapel and was going to prick his flesh, but Tom said:<br/>"Hold on! Don't do that. A pin's brass. It might have verdigrease<br/>on it."<br/><br/>"What's verdigrease?"<br/><br/>"It's p'ison. That's what it is. You just swaller some of it<br/>once â€” you'll see."<br/><br/>So Tom unwound the thread from one of his needles, and each boy<br/>pricked the ball of his thumb and squeezed out a drop of blood. In<br/>time, after many squeezes, Tom managed to sign his initials, using<br/>the ball of his little finger for a pen. Then he showed Huckleberry<br/>how to make an H and an F, and the oath was complete. They buried<br/>the shingle close to the wall, with some dismal ceremonies and<br/>incantations, and the fetters that bound their tongues were<br/>considered to be locked and the key thrown away.<br/><br/>A figure crept stealthily through a break in the other end of<br/>the ruined building, now, but they did not notice it.<br/>
