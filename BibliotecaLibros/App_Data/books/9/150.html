"Oh, kings have slathers of them."<br/><br/>"Well, I don' know no kings, Tom."<br/><br/>"I reckon you don't. But if you was to go to Europe you'd see a<br/>raft of 'em hopping around."<br/><br/>"Do they hop?"<br/><br/>"Hop? — your granny! No!"<br/><br/>"Well, what did you say they did, for?"<br/><br/>"Shucks, I only meant you'd see 'em — not hopping, of course —<br/>what do they want to hop for? — but I mean you'd just see 'em —<br/>scattered around, you know, in a kind of a general way. Like that<br/>old humpbacked Richard."<br/><br/>"Richard? What's his other name?"<br/><br/>"He didn't have any other name. Kings don't have any but a given<br/>name."<br/><br/>"No?"<br/><br/>"But they don't."<br/>
