Huckleberry was filled with admiration of Tom's facility in
writing, and the sublimity of his language. He at once took a pin
from his lapel and was going to prick his flesh, but Tom said:
"Hold on! Don't do that. A pin's brass. It might have verdigrease
on it."

"What's verdigrease?"

"It's p'ison. That's what it is. You just swaller some of it
once â€” you'll see."

So Tom unwound the thread from one of his needles, and each boy
pricked the ball of his thumb and squeezed out a drop of blood. In
time, after many squeezes, Tom managed to sign his initials, using
the ball of his little finger for a pen. Then he showed Huckleberry
how to make an H and an F, and the oath was complete. They buried
the shingle close to the wall, with some dismal ceremonies and
incantations, and the fetters that bound their tongues were
considered to be locked and the key thrown away.

A figure crept stealthily through a break in the other end of
the ruined building, now, but they did not notice it.
