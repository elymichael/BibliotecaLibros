"All right, I'll keep still. Now they're stuck. Can't find it.
Here they come again. Now they're hot. Cold again. Hot again. Red
hot! They're p'inted right, this time. Say, Huck, I know another o'
them voices; it's Injun Joe."

"That's so â€” that murderin' half-breed! I'd druther they was
devils a dern sight. What kin they be up to?"

The whisper died wholly out, now, for the three men had reached
the grave and stood within a few feet of the boys'
hiding-place.

"Here it is," said the third voice; and the owner of it held the
lantern up and revealed the face of young Doctor Robinson.

Potter and Injun Joe were carrying a handbarrow with a rope and
a couple of shovels on it. They cast down their load and began to
open the grave. The doctor put the lantern at the head of the grave
and came and sat down with his back against one of the elm trees.
He was so close the boys could have touched him.

"Hurry, men!" he said, in a low voice; "the moon might come out
at any moment."

They growled a response and went on digging. For some time there
was no noise but the grating sound of the spades discharging their
freight of mould and gravel. It was very monotonous. Finally a
spade struck upon the coffin with a dull woody accent, and within
another minute or two the men had hoisted it out on the ground.
They pried off the lid with their shovels, got out the body and
dumped it rudely on the ground. The moon drifted from behind the
clouds and exposed the pallid face. The barrow was got ready and
the corpse placed on it, covered with a blanket, and bound to its
place with the rope. Potter took out a large spring-knife and cut
off the dangling end of the rope and then said:

"Now the cussed thing's ready, Sawbones, and you'll just out
with another five, or here she stays."

"That's the talk!" said Injun Joe.

"Look here, what does this mean?" said the doctor. "You required
your pay in advance, and I've paid you."
