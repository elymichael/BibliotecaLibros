There comes a time in every rightly-constructed boy's life when
he has a raging desire to go somewhere and dig for hidden treasure.
This desire suddenly came upon Tom one day. He sallied out to find
Joe Harper, but failed of success. Next he sought Ben Rogers; he
had gone fishing. Presently he stumbled upon Huck Finn the
Red-Handed. Huck would answer. Tom took him to a private place and
opened the matter to him confidentially. Huck was willing. Huck was
always willing to take a hand in any enterprise that offered
entertainment and required no capital, for he had a troublesome
superabundance of that sort of time which is not money. "Where'll
we dig?" said Huck. "Oh, most anywhere."

"Why, is it hid all around?"

"No, indeed it ain't. It's hid in mighty particular places, Huck
— sometimes on islands, sometimes in rotten chests under the end of
a limb of an old dead tree, just where the shadow falls at
midnight; but mostly under the floor in ha'nted houses."

"Who hides it?"

"Why, robbers, of course — who'd you reckon? Sunday-school
sup'rintendents?"

"I don't know. If 'twas mine I wouldn't hide it; I'd spend it
and have a good time."
