<br/>"The money's in the cave!"<br/><br/>"Tom — honest injun, now — is it fun, or earnest?"<br/><br/>"Earnest, Huck — just as earnest as ever I was in my life. Will<br/>you go in there with me and help get it out?"<br/><br/>"I bet I will! I will if it's where we can blaze our way to it<br/>and not get lost."<br/><br/>"Huck, we can do that without the least little bit of trouble in<br/>the world."<br/><br/>"Good as wheat! What makes you think the money's —"<br/><br/>"Huck, you just wait till we get in there. If we don't find it<br/>I'll agree to give you my drum and every thing I've got in the<br/>world. I will, by jings."<br/><br/>"All right — it's a whiz. When do you say?"<br/><br/>"Right now, if you say it. Are you strong enough?"<br/><br/>"Is it far in the cave? I ben on my pins a little, three or four<br/>days, now, but I can't walk more'n a mile, Tom — least I don't<br/>think I could."<br/><br/>
