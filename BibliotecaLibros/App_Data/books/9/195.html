"When would they miss us, Tom?"<br/><br/>"When they get back to the boat, I reckon."<br/><br/>"Tom, it might be dark then — would they notice we hadn't<br/>come?"<br/><br/>"I don't know. But anyway, your mother would miss you as soon as<br/>they got home."<br/><br/>A frightened look in Becky's face brought Tom to his senses and<br/>he saw that he had made a blunder. Becky was not to have gone home<br/>that night! The children became silent and thoughtful. In a moment<br/>a new burst of grief from Becky showed Tom that the thing in his<br/>mind had struck hers also — that the Sabbath morning might be half<br/>spent before Mrs. Thatcher discovered that Becky was not at Mrs.<br/>Harper's.<br/><br/>The children fastened their eyes upon their bit of candle and<br/>watched it melt slowly and pitilessly away; saw the half inch of<br/>wick stand alone at last; saw the feeble flame rise and fall, climb<br/>the thin column of smoke, linger at its top a moment, and then —<br/>the horror of utter darkness reigned!<br/><br/>How long afterward it was that Becky came to a slow<br/>consciousness that she was crying in Tom's arms, neither could<br/>tell. All that they knew was, that after what seemed a mighty<br/>stretch of time, both awoke out of a dead stupor of sleep and<br/>resumed their miseries once more. Tom said it might be Sunday, now<br/>— maybe Monday. He tried to get Becky to talk, but her sorrows were<br/>too oppressive, all her hopes were gone. Tom said that they must<br/>have been missed long ago, and no doubt the search was going on. He<br/>would shout and maybe some one would come. He tried it; but in the<br/>darkness the distant echoes sounded so hideously that he tried it<br/>no more.<br/><br/>The hours wasted away, and hunger came to torment the captives<br/>again. A portion of Tom's half of the cake was left; they divided<br/>and ate it. But they seemed hungrier than before. The poor morsel<br/>of food only whetted desire.<br/><br/>By-and-by Tom said:<br/><br/>"Sh! Did you hear that?"<br/><br/>Both held their breath and listened. There was a sound like the<br/>faintest, far-off shout. Instantly Tom answered it, and leading<br/>Becky by the hand, started groping down the corridor in its<br/>direction. Presently he listened again; again the sound was heard,<br/>and apparently a little nearer.<br/>
