<br/>"Any other boy!" Tom thought, grating his teeth. "Any boy in the<br/>whole town but that Saint Louis smarty that thinks he dresses so<br/>fine and is aristocracy! Oh, all right, I licked you the first day<br/>you ever saw this town, mister, and I'll lick you again! You just<br/>wait till I catch you out! I'll just take and —"<br/><br/>And he went through the motions of thrashing an imaginary boy —<br/>pummelling the air, and kicking and gouging. "Oh, you do, do you?<br/>You holler 'nough, do you? Now, then, let that learn you!" And so<br/>the imaginary flogging was finished to his satisfaction.<br/><br/>Tom fled home at noon. His conscience could not endure any more<br/>of Amy's grateful happiness, and his jealousy could bear no more of<br/>the other distress. Becky resumed her picture inspections with<br/>Alfred, but as the minutes dragged along and no Tom came to suffer,<br/>her triumph began to cloud and she lost interest; gravity and<br/>absent-mindedness followed, and then melancholy; two or three times<br/>she pricked up her ear at a footstep, but it was a false hope; no<br/>Tom came. At last she grew entirely miserable and wished she hadn't<br/>carried it so far. When poor Alfred, seeing that he was losing her,<br/>he did not know how, kept exclaiming: "Oh, here's a jolly one! look<br/>at this!" she lost patience at last, and said, "Oh, don't bother<br/>me! I don't care for them!" and burst into tears, and got up and<br/>walked away.<br/><br/>Alfred dropped alongside and was going to try to comfort her,<br/>but she said:<br/><br/>"Go away and leave me alone, can't you! I hate you!"<br/><br/>So the boy halted, wondering what he could have done — for she<br/>had said she would look at pictures all through the nooning — and<br/>she walked on, crying. Then Alfred went musing into the deserted<br/>schoolhouse. He was humiliated and angry. He easily guessed his way<br/>to the truth — the girl had simply made a convenience of him to<br/>vent her spite upon Tom Sawyer. He was far from hating Tom the less<br/>when this thought occurred to him. He wished there was some way to<br/>get that boy into trouble without much risk to himself. Tom's<br/>spelling-book fell under his eye. Here was his opportunity. He<br/>gratefully opened to the lesson for the afternoon and poured ink<br/>upon the page.<br/><br/>Becky, glancing in at a window behind him at the moment, saw the<br/>act, and moved on, without discovering herself. She started<br/>homeward, now, intending to find Tom and tell him; Tom would be<br/>thankful and their troubles would be healed. Before she was half<br/>way home, however, she had changed her mind. The thought of Tom's<br/>treatment of her when she was talking about her picnic came<br/>scorching back and filled her with shame. She resolved to let him<br/>get whipped on the damaged spelling-book's account, and to hate him<br/>forever, into the bargain.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
