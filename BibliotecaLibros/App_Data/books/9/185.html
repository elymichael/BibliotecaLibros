<br/>"Of burglar's tools. Why, what's the matter with you?"<br/><br/>Huck sank back, panting gently, but deeply, unutterably<br/>grateful. The Welshman eyed him gravely, curiously — and presently<br/>said:<br/><br/>"Yes, burglar's tools. That appears to relieve you a good deal.<br/>But what did give you that turn? What were you expecting we'd<br/>found?"<br/><br/>Huck was in a close place — the inquiring eye was upon him — he<br/>would have given anything for material for a plausible answer —<br/>nothing suggested itself — the inquiring eye was boring deeper and<br/>deeper — a senseless reply offered — there was no time to weigh it,<br/>so at a venture he uttered it — feebly:<br/><br/>"Sunday-school books, maybe."<br/><br/>Poor Huck was too distressed to smile, but the old man laughed<br/>loud and joyously, shook up the details of his anatomy from head to<br/>foot, and ended by saying that such a laugh was money in a-man's<br/>pocket, because it cut down the doctor's bill like everything. Then<br/>he added:<br/><br/>"Poor old chap, you're white and jaded — you ain't well a bit —<br/>no wonder you're a little flighty and off your balance. But you'll<br/>come out of it. Rest and sleep will fetch you out all right, I<br/>hope."<br/><br/>Huck was irritated to think he had been such a goose and<br/>betrayed such a suspicious excitement, for he had dropped the idea<br/>that the parcel brought from the tavern was the treasure, as soon<br/>as he had heard the talk at the widow's stile. He had only thought<br/>it was not the treasure, however — he had not known that it wasn't<br/>— and so the suggestion of a captured bundle was too much for his<br/>self-possession. But on the whole he felt glad the little episode<br/>had happened, for now he knew beyond all question that that bundle<br/>was not the bundle, and so his mind was at rest and exceedingly<br/>comfortable. In fact, everything seemed to be drifting just in the<br/>right direction, now; the treasure must be still in No. 2, the men<br/>would be captured and jailed that day, and he and Tom could seize<br/>the gold that night without any trouble or any fear of<br/>interruption.<br/><br/>Just as breakfast was completed there was a knock at the door.<br/>Huck jumped for a hiding-place, for he had no mind to be connected<br/>even remotely with the late event. The Welshman admitted several<br/>ladies and gentlemen, among them the Widow Douglas, and noticed<br/>that groups of citizens were climbing up the hill — to stare at the<br/>stile. So the news had spread. The Welshman had to tell the story<br/>of the night to the visitors. The widow's gratitude for her<br/>preservation was outspoken.<br/><br/>"Don't say a word about it, madam. There's another that you're<br/>more beholden to than you are to me and my boys, maybe, but he<br/>don't allow me to tell his name. We wouldn't have been there but<br/>for him."<br/><br/>
