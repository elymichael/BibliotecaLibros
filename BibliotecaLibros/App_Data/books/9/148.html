They always hide it<br/>and leave it there."<br/><br/>"Don't they come after it any more?"<br/><br/>"No, they think they will, but they generally forget the marks,<br/>or else they die. Anyway, it lays there a long time and gets rusty;<br/>and by and by somebody finds an old yellow paper that tells how to<br/>find the marks — a paper that's got to be ciphered over about a<br/>week because it's mostly signs and hy'roglyphics."<br/><br/>"HyroQwhich?"<br/><br/>"Hy'roglyphics — pictures and things, you know, that don't seem<br/>to mean anything."<br/><br/>"Have you got one of them papers, Tom?"<br/><br/>"No."<br/><br/>"Well then, how you going to find the marks?"<br/><br/>"I don't want any marks. They always bury it under a ha'nted<br/>house or on an island, or under a dead tree that's got one limb<br/>sticking out. Well, we've tried Jackson's Island a little, and we<br/>can try it again some time; and there's the old ha'nted house up<br/>the Still-House branch, and there's lots of deadlimb trees — dead<br/>loads of 'em."<br/><br/>"Is it under all of them?"<br/><br/>"How you talk! No!"<br/>
