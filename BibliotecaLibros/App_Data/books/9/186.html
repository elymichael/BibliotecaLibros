Of course this excited a curiosity so vast that it almost<br/>belittled the main matter — but the Welshman allowed it to eat into<br/>the vitals of his visitors, and through them be transmitted to the<br/>whole town, for he refused to part with his secret. When all else<br/>had been learned, the widow said:<br/><br/>"I went to sleep reading in bed and slept straight through all<br/>that noise. Why didn't you come and wake me?"<br/><br/>"We judged it warn't worth while. Those fellows warn't likely to<br/>come again — they hadn't any tools left to work with, and what was<br/>the use of waking you up and scaring you to death? My three negro<br/>men stood guard at your house all the rest of the night. They've<br/>just come back."<br/><br/>More visitors came, and the story had to be told and retold for<br/>a couple of hours more.<br/><br/>There was no Sabbath-school during day-school vacation, but<br/>everybody was early at church. The stirring event was well<br/>canvassed. News came that not a sign of the two villains had been<br/>yet discovered. When the sermon was finished, Judge Thatcher's wife<br/>dropped alongside of Mrs. Harper as she moved down the aisle with<br/>the crowd and said:<br/><br/>"Is my Becky going to sleep all day? I just expected she would<br/>be tired to death."<br/><br/>"Your Becky?"<br/><br/>"Yes," with a startled look — "didn't she stay with you last<br/>night?"<br/><br/>"Why, no."<br/><br/>Mrs. Thatcher turned pale, and sank into a pew, just as Aunt<br/>Polly, talking briskly with a friend, passed by. Aunt Polly<br/>said:<br/><br/>"Good-morning, Mrs. Thatcher. Good-morning, Mrs. Harper. I've<br/>got a boy that's turned up missing. I reckon my Tom stayed at your<br/>house last night — one of you. And now he's afraid to come to<br/>church. I've got to settle with him."<br/>
