<br/>"Yes, but, Huck, ghosts don't travel around only at night. They<br/>won't hender us from digging there in the daytime."<br/><br/>"Well, that's so. But you know mighty well people don't go about<br/>that ha'nted house in the day nor the night."<br/><br/>"Well, that's mostly because they don't like to go where a man's<br/>been murdered, anyway — but nothing's ever been seen around that<br/>house except in the night — just some blue lights slipping by the<br/>windows — no regular ghosts."<br/><br/>"Well, where you see one of them blue lights flickering around,<br/>Tom, you can bet there's a ghost mighty close behind it. It stands<br/>to reason. Becuz you know that they don't anybody but ghosts use<br/>'em."<br/><br/>"Yes, that's so. But anyway they don't come around in the<br/>daytime, so what's the use of our being afeard?"<br/><br/>"Well, all right. We'll tackle the ha'nted house if you say so —<br/>but I reckon it's taking chances."<br/><br/>They had started down the hill by this time. There in the middle<br/>of the moonlit valley below them stood the "ha'nted" house, utterly<br/>isolated, its fences gone long ago, rank weeds smothering the very<br/>doorsteps, the chimney crumbled to ruin, the window-sashes vacant,<br/>a corner of the roof caved in. The boys gazed awhile, half<br/>expecting to see a blue light flit past a window; then talking in a<br/>low tone, as befitted the time and the circumstances, they struck<br/>far off to the right, to give the haunted house a wide berth, and<br/>took their way homeward through the woods that adorned the rearward<br/>side of Cardiff Hill.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
