Pap would come back to thish-yer town<br/>some day and get his claws on it if I didn't hurry up, and I tell<br/>you he'd clean it out pretty quick. What you going to do with<br/>yourn, Tom?"<br/><br/>"I'm going to buy a new drum, and a sure-'nough sword, and a red<br/>necktie and a bull pup, and get married."<br/><br/>"Married!"<br/><br/>"That's it."<br/><br/>"Tom, you — why, you ain't in your right mind."<br/><br/>"Wait — you'll see."<br/><br/>"Well, that's the foolishest thing you could do. Look at pap and<br/>my mother. Fight! Why, they used to fight all the time. I remember,<br/>mighty well."<br/><br/>"That ain't anything. The girl I'm going to marry won't<br/>fight."<br/><br/>"Tom, I reckon they're all alike. They'll all comb a body. Now<br/>you better think 'bout this awhile. I tell you you better. What's<br/>the name of the gal?"<br/><br/>"It ain't a gal at all — it's a girl."<br/>
