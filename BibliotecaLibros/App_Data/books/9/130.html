"Rebecca Thatcher" [Tom glanced at her face — it was white with<br/>terror] — "did you tear — no, look me in the face" [her hands rose<br/>in appeal] — "did you tear this book?"<br/><br/>A thought shot like lightning through Tom's brain. He sprang to<br/>his feet and shouted — "I done it!"<br/><br/>The school stared in perplexity at this incredible folly. Tom<br/>stood a moment, to gather his dismembered faculties; and when he<br/>stepped forward to go to his punishment the surprise, the<br/>gratitude, the adoration that shone upon him out of poor Becky's<br/>eyes seemed pay enough for a hundred floggings. Inspired by the<br/>splendor of his own act, he took without an outcry the most<br/>merciless flaying that even Mr. Dobbins had ever administered; and<br/>also received with indifference the added cruelty of a command to<br/>remain two hours after school should be dismissed — for he knew who<br/>would wait for him outside till his captivity was done, and not<br/>count the tedious time as loss, either.<br/><br/>Tom went to bed that night planning vengeance against Alfred<br/>Temple; for with shame and repentance Becky had told him all, not<br/>forgetting her own treachery; but even the longing for vengeance<br/>had to give way, soon, to pleasanter musings, and he fell asleep at<br/>last with Becky's latest words lingering dreamily in his ear —<br/><br/>"Tom, how could you be so noble!"<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
