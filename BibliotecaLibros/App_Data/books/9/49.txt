The artist erected a man in the front yard, that resembled a
derrick. He could have stepped over the house; but the girl was not
hypercritical; she was satisfied with the monster, and
whispered:

"It's a beautiful man — now make me coming along."

Tom drew an hour-glass with a full moon and straw limbs to it
and armed the spreading fingers with a portentous fan. The girl
said:

"It's ever so nice — I wish I could draw."

"It's easy," whispered Tom, "I'll learn you."

"Oh, will you? When?"

"At noon. Do you go home to dinner?"

"I'll stay if you will."

"Good — that's a whack. What's your name?"

"Becky Thatcher. What's yours? Oh, I know. It's Thomas
Sawyer."

"That's the name they lick me by. I'm Tom when I'm good. You
call me Tom, will you?"
