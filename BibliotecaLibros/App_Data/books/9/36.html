<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>6<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>Monday morning found Tom Sawyer miserable. Monday morning always<br/>found him so â€” because it began another week's slow suffering in<br/>school. He generally began that day with wishing he had had no<br/>intervening holiday, it made the going into captivity and fetters<br/>again so much more odious.<br/><br/>Tom lay thinking. Presently it occurred to him that he wished he<br/>was sick; then he could stay home from school. Here was a vague<br/>possibility. He canvassed his system. No ailment was found, and he<br/>investigated again. This time he thought he could detect colicky<br/>symptoms, and he began to encourage them with considerable hope.<br/>But they soon grew feeble, and presently died wholly away. He<br/>reflected further. Suddenly he discovered something. One of his<br/>upper front teeth was loose. This was lucky; he was about to begin<br/>to groan, as a "starter," as he called it, when it occurred to him<br/>that if he came into court with that argument, his aunt would pull<br/>it out, and that would hurt. So he thought he would hold the tooth<br/>in reserve for the present, and seek further. Nothing offered for<br/>some little time, and then he remembered hearing the doctor tell<br/>about a certain thing that laid up a patient for two or three weeks<br/>and threatened to make him lose a finger. So the boy eagerly drew<br/>his sore toe from under the sheet and held it up for inspection.<br/>But now he did not know the necessary symptoms. However, it seemed<br/>well worth while to chance it, so he fell to groaning with<br/>considerable spirit.<br/><br/>But Sid slept on unconscious.<br/><br/>Tom groaned louder, and fancied that he began to feel pain in<br/>the toe.<br/><br/>No result from Sid.<br/><br/>Tom was panting with his exertions by this time. He took a rest<br/>and then swelled himself up and fetched a succession of admirable<br/>groans.<br/><br/>
