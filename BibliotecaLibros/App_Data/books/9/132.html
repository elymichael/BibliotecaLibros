Let us return to the "Examination." The first composition that<br/>was read was one entitled "Is this, then, Life?" Perhaps the reader<br/>can endure an extract from it:<br/><br/>"In the common walks of life, with what delightful emotions does<br/>the youthful mind look forward to some anticipated scene of<br/>festivity! Imagination is busy sketching rose-tinted pictures of<br/>joy. In fancy, the voluptuous votary of fashion sees herself amid<br/>the festive throng, 'the observed of all observers.' Her graceful<br/>form, arrayed in snowy robes, is whirling through the mazes of the<br/>joyous dance; her eye is brightest, her step is lightest in the gay<br/>assembly. "In such delicious fancies time quickly glides by, and<br/>the welcome hour arrives for her entrance into the Elysian world,<br/>of which she has had such bright dreams. How fairy-like does<br/>everything appear to her enchanted vision! Each new scene is more<br/>charming than the last. But after a while she finds that beneath<br/>this goodly exterior, all is vanity, the flattery which once<br/>charmed her soul, now grates harshly upon her ear; the ball-room<br/>has lost its charms; and with wasted health and imbittered heart,<br/>she turns away with the conviction that earthly pleasures cannot<br/>satisfy the longings of the soul!"<br/><br/>And so forth and so on. There was a buzz of gratification from<br/>time to time during the reading, accompanied by whispered<br/>ejaculations of "How sweet!" "How eloquent!" "So true!" etc., and<br/>after the thing had closed with a peculiarly afflicting sermon the<br/>applause was enthusiastic. Then arose a slim, melancholy girl,<br/>whose face had the "interesting" paleness that comes of pills and<br/>indigestion, and read a "poem." Two stanzas of it will do:<br/><br/>"A Missouri Maiden's Farewell to Alabama<br/><br/>"Alabama, good-bye! I love thee well!<br/><br/>But yet for a while do I leave thee now!<br/><br/>Sad, yes, sad thoughts of thee my heart doth swell,<br/><br/>And burning recollections throng my brow!<br/><br/>For I have wandered through thy flowery woods;<br/><br/>Have roamed and read near Tallapoosa's stream;<br/><br/>Have listened to Tallassee's warring floods,<br/>
