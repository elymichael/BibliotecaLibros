"It's to swear to stand by one another, and never tell the
gang's secrets, even if you're chopped all to flinders, and kill
anybody and all his family that hurts one of the gang."

"That's gay — that's mighty gay, Tom, I tell you."

"Well, I bet it is. And all that swearing's got to be done at
midnight, in the lonesomest, awfulest place you can find — a
ha'nted house is the best, but they're all ripped up now."

"Well, midnight's good, anyway, Tom."

"Yes, so it is. And you've got to swear on a coffin, and sign it
with blood."

"Now, that's something like! Why, it's a million times bullier
than pirating. I'll stick to the widder till I rot, Tom; and if I
git to be a reg'lar ripper of a robber, and everybody talking 'bout
it, I reckon she'll be proud she snaked me in out of the wet."
