"Look as far around the corner as you can. Do you see that?<br/>There — on the big rock over yonder — done with candle-smoke."<br/><br/>"Tom, it's a cross!"<br/><br/>"Now where's your Number Two? 'Under the cross,' hey? Right<br/>yonder's where I saw Injun Joe poke up his candle, Huck!"<br/><br/>Huck stared at the mystic sign awhile, and then said with a<br/>shaky voice:<br/><br/>"Tom, less git out of here!"<br/><br/>"What! and leave the treasure?"<br/><br/>"Yes — leave it. Injun Joe's ghost is round about there,<br/>certain."<br/><br/>"No it ain't, Huck, no it ain't. It would ha'nt the place where<br/>he died — away out at the mouth of the cave — five mile from<br/>here."<br/><br/>"No, Tom, it wouldn't. It would hang round the money. I know the<br/>ways of ghosts, and so do you."<br/><br/>Tom began to fear that Huck was right. Misgivings gathered in<br/>his mind. But presently an idea occurred to him —<br/><br/>"Lookyhere, Huck, what fools we're making of ourselves! Injun<br/>Joe's ghost ain't a going to come around where there's a<br/>cross!"<br/>
