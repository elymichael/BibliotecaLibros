<br/>"Never you mind, Tom. You know if I say it's nice, it is<br/>nice."<br/><br/>"You bet you that's so, Mary. All right, I'll tackle it<br/>again."<br/><br/>And he did "tackle it again" — and under the double pressure of<br/>curiosity and prospective gain he did it with such spirit that he<br/>accomplished a shining success. Mary gave him a brand-new "Barlow"<br/>knife worth twelve and a half cents; and the convulsion of delight<br/>that swept his system shook him to his foundations. True, the knife<br/>would not cut anything, but it was a "sure-enough" Barlow, and<br/>there was inconceivable grandeur in that — though where the Western<br/>boys ever got the idea that such a weapon could possibly be<br/>counterfeited to its injury is an imposing mystery and will always<br/>remain so, perhaps. Tom contrived to scarify the cupboard with it,<br/>and was arranging to begin on the bureau, when he was called off to<br/>dress for Sunday-school.<br/><br/>Mary gave him a tin basin of water and a piece of soap, and he<br/>went outside the door and set the basin on a little bench there;<br/>then he dipped the soap in the water and laid it down; turned up<br/>his sleeves; poured out the water on the ground, gently, and then<br/>entered the kitchen and began to wipe his face diligently on the<br/>towel behind the door. But Mary removed the towel and said:<br/><br/>"Now ain't you ashamed, Tom. You mustn't be so bad. Water won't<br/>hurt you."<br/><br/>Tom was a trifle disconcerted. The basin was refilled, and this<br/>time he stood over it a little while, gathering resolution; took in<br/>a big breath and began. When he entered the kitchen presently, with<br/>both eyes shut and groping for the towel with his hands, an<br/>honorable testimony of suds and water was dripping from his face.<br/>But when he emerged from the towel, he was not yet satisfactory,<br/>for the clean territory stopped short at his chin and his jaws,<br/>like a mask; below and beyond this line there was a dark expanse of<br/>unirrigated soil that spread downward in front and backward around<br/>his neck. Mary took him in hand, and when she was done with him he<br/>was a man and a brother, without distinction of color, and his<br/>saturated hair was neatly brushed, and its short curls wrought into<br/>a dainty and symmetrical general effect. [He privately smoothed out<br/>the curls, with labor and difficulty, and plastered his hair close<br/>down to his head; for he held curls to be effeminate, and his own<br/>filled his life with bitterness.] Then Mary got out a suit of his<br/>clothing that had been used only on Sundays during two years — they<br/>were simply called his "other clothes" — and so by that we know the<br/>size of his wardrobe. The girl "put him to rights" after he had<br/>dressed himself; she buttoned his neat roundabout up to his chin,<br/>turned his vast shirt collar down over his shoulders, brushed him<br/>off and crowned him with his speckled straw hat. He now looked<br/>exceedingly improved and uncomfortable. He was fully as<br/>uncomfortable as he looked; for there was a restraint about whole<br/>clothes and cleanliness that galled him. He hoped that Mary would<br/>forget his shoes, but the hope was blighted; she coated them<br/>thoroughly with tallow, as was the custom, and brought them out. He<br/>lost his temper and said he was always being made to do everything<br/>he didn't want to do. But Mary said, persuasively:<br/><br/>"Please, Tom — that's a good boy."<br/><br/>So he got into the shoes snarling. Mary was soon ready, and the<br/>three children set out for Sunday-school — a place that Tom hated<br/>with his whole heart; but Sid and Mary were fond of it.<br/><br/>Sabbath-school hours were from nine to half-past ten; and then<br/>church service. Two of the children always remained for the sermon<br/>voluntarily, and the other always remained too — for stronger<br/>reasons. The church's high-backed, uncushioned pews would seat<br/>about three hundred persons; the edifice was but a small, plain<br/>affair, with a sort of pine board tree-box on top of it for a<br/>steeple. At the door Tom dropped back a step and accosted a<br/>Sunday-dressed comrade:<br/><br/>"Say, Billy, got a yaller ticket?"<br/><br/>
