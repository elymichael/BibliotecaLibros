"Huck, I most stepped onto Injun Joe's hand!"<br/><br/>"No!"<br/><br/>"Yes! He was lying there, sound asleep on the floor, with his<br/>old patch on his eye and his arms spread out."<br/><br/>"Lordy, what did you do? Did he wake up?"<br/><br/>"No, never budged. Drunk, I reckon. I just grabbed that towel<br/>and started!"<br/><br/>"I'd never 'a' thought of the towel, I bet!"<br/><br/>"Well, I would. My aunt would make me mighty sick if I lost<br/>it."<br/><br/>"Say, Tom, did you see that box?"<br/><br/>"Huck, I didn't wait to look around. I didn't see the box, I<br/>didn't see the cross. I didn't see anything but a bottle and a tin<br/>cup on the floor by Injun Joe; yes, I saw two barrels and lots more<br/>bottles in the room. Don't you see, now, what's the matter with<br/>that ha'nted room?"<br/><br/>"How?"<br/><br/>"Why, it's ha'nted with whiskey! Maybe all the Temperance<br/>Taverns have got a ha'nted room, hey, Huck?"<br/>
