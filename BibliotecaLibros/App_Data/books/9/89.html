"I know you was meaning for the best, aunty, and so was I with<br/>Peter. It done him good, too. I never see him get around so since<br/>—"<br/><br/>"Oh, go 'long with you, Tom, before you aggravate me again. And<br/>you try and see if you can't be a good boy, for once, and you<br/>needn't take any more medicine."<br/><br/>Tom reached school ahead of time. It was noticed that this<br/>strange thing had been occurring every day latterly. And now, as<br/>usual of late, he hung about the gate of the schoolyard instead of<br/>playing with his comrades. He was sick, he said, and he looked it.<br/>He tried to seem to be looking everywhere but whither he really was<br/>looking — down the road. Presently Jeff Thatcher hove in sight, and<br/>Tom's face lighted; he gazed a moment, and then turned sorrowfully<br/>away. When Jeff arrived, Tom accosted him; and "led up" warily to<br/>opportunities for remark about Becky, but the giddy lad never could<br/>see the bait. Tom watched and watched, hoping whenever a frisking<br/>frock came in sight, and hating the owner of it as soon as he saw<br/>she was not the right one. At last frocks ceased to appear, and he<br/>dropped hopelessly into the dumps; he entered the empty schoolhouse<br/>and sat down to suffer. Then one more frock passed in at the gate,<br/>and Tom's heart gave a great bound. The next instant he was out,<br/>and "going on" like an Indian; yelling, laughing, chasing boys,<br/>jumping over the fence at risk of life and limb, throwing<br/>handsprings, standing on his head — doing all the heroic things he<br/>could conceive of, and keeping a furtive eye out, all the while, to<br/>see if Becky Thatcher was noticing. But she seemed to be<br/>unconscious of it all; she never looked. Could it be possible that<br/>she was not aware that he was there? He carried his exploits to her<br/>immediate vicinity; came war-whooping around, snatched a boy's cap,<br/>hurled it to the roof of the schoolhouse, broke through a group of<br/>boys, tumbling them in every direction, and fell sprawling,<br/>himself, under Becky's nose, almost upsetting her — and she turned,<br/>with her nose in the air, and he heard her say: "Mf! some people<br/>think they're mighty smart — always showing off!"<br/><br/>Tom's cheeks burned. He gathered himself up and sneaked off,<br/>crushed and crestfallen.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
