"I reckon that'll be a good one. But won't the widow take it<br/>away from us, Tom? It's on her land."<br/><br/>"She take it away! Maybe she'd like to try it once. Whoever<br/>finds one of these hid treasures, it belongs to him. It don't make<br/>any difference whose land it's on."<br/><br/>That was satisfactory. The work went on. By and by Huck<br/>said:<br/><br/>"Blame it, we must be in the wrong place again. What do you<br/>think?"<br/><br/>"It is mighty curious, Huck. I don't understand it. Sometimes<br/>witches interfere. I reckon maybe that's what's the trouble<br/>now."<br/><br/>"Shucks! Witches ain't got no power in the daytime."<br/><br/>"Well, that's so. I didn't think of that. Oh, I know what the<br/>matter is! What a blamed lot of fools we are! You got to find out<br/>where the shadow of the limb falls at midnight, and that's where<br/>you dig!"<br/><br/>"Then consound it, we've fooled away all this work for nothing.<br/>Now hang it all, we got to come back in the night. It's an awful<br/>long way. Can you get out?"<br/><br/>"I bet I will. We've got to do it to-night, too, because if<br/>somebody sees these holes they'll know in a minute what's here and<br/>they'll go for it."<br/><br/>"Well, I'll come around and maow to-night."<br/><br/>"All right. Let's hide the tools in the bushes."<br/>
