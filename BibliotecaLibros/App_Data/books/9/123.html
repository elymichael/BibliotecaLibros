<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>19<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>Tom arrived at home in a dreary mood, and the first thing his<br/>aunt said to him showed him that he had brought his sorrows to an<br/>unpromising market:<br/><br/>"Tom, I've a notion to skin you alive!"<br/><br/>"Auntie, what have I done?"<br/><br/>"Well, you've done enough. Here I go over to Sereny Harper, like<br/>an old softy, expecting I'm going to make her believe all that<br/>rubbage about that dream, when lo and behold you she'd found out<br/>from Joe that you was over here and heard all the talk we had that<br/>night. Tom, I don't know what is to become of a boy that will act<br/>like that. It makes me feel so bad to think you could let me go to<br/>Sereny Harper and make such a fool of myself and never say a<br/>word."<br/><br/>This was a new aspect of the thing. His smartness of the morning<br/>had seemed to Tom a good joke before, and very ingenious. It merely<br/>looked mean and shabby now. He hung his head and could not think of<br/>anything to say for a moment. Then he said:<br/><br/>"Auntie, I wish I hadn't done it â€” but I didn't think."<br/><br/>
