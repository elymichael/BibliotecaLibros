<br/>"Oh, please, auntie, don't pull it out. It don't hurt any more.<br/>I wish I may never stir if it does. Please don't, auntie. I don't<br/>want to stay home from school."<br/><br/>"Oh, you don't, don't you? So all this row was because you<br/>thought you'd get to stay home from school and go a-fishing? Tom,<br/>Tom, I love you so, and you seem to try every way you can to break<br/>my old heart with your outrageousness." By this time the dental<br/>instruments were ready. The old lady made one end of the silk<br/>thread fast to Tom's tooth with a loop and tied the other to the<br/>bedpost. Then she seized the chunk of fire and suddenly thrust it<br/>almost into the boy's face. The tooth hung dangling by the bedpost,<br/>now.<br/><br/>But all trials bring their compensations. As Tom wended to<br/>school after breakfast, he was the envy of every boy he met because<br/>the gap in his upper row of teeth enabled him to expectorate in a<br/>new and admirable way. He gathered quite a following of lads<br/>interested in the exhibition; and one that had cut his finger and<br/>had been a centre of fascination and homage up to this time, now<br/>found himself suddenly without an adherent, and shorn of his glory.<br/>His heart was heavy, and he said with a disdain which he did not<br/>feel that it wasn't anything to spit like Tom Sawyer; but another<br/>boy said, "Sour grapes!" and he wandered away a dismantled<br/>hero.<br/><br/>Shortly Tom came upon the juvenile pariah of the village,<br/>Huckleberry Finn, son of the town drunkard. Huckleberry was<br/>cordially hated and dreaded by all the mothers of the town, because<br/>he was idle and lawless and vulgar and bad â€” and because all their<br/>children admired him so, and delighted in his forbidden society,<br/>and wished they dared to be like him. Tom was like the rest of the<br/>respectable boys, in that he envied Huckleberry his gaudy outcast<br/>condition, and was under strict orders not to play with him. So he<br/>played with him every time he got a chance. Huckleberry was always<br/>dressed in the cast-off clothes of full-grown men, and they were in<br/>perennial bloom and fluttering with rags. His hat was a vast ruin<br/>with a wide crescent lopped out of its brim; his coat, when he wore<br/>one, hung nearly to his heels and had the rearward buttons far down<br/>the back; but one suspender supported his trousers; the seat of the<br/>trousers bagged low and contained nothing, the fringed legs dragged<br/>in the dirt when not rolled up.<br/><br/>Huckleberry came and went, at his own free will. He slept on<br/>doorsteps in fine weather and in empty hogsheads in wet; he did not<br/>have to go to school or to church, or call any being master or obey<br/>anybody; he could go fishing or swimming when and where he chose,<br/>and stay as long as it suited him; nobody forbade him to fight; he<br/>could sit up as late as he pleased; he was always the first boy<br/>that went barefoot in the spring and the last to resume leather in<br/>the fall; he never had to wash, nor put on clean clothes; he could<br/>swear wonderfully. In a word, everything that goes to make life<br/>precious that boy had. So thought every harassed, hampered,<br/>respectable boy in St. Petersburg.<br/><br/>Tom hailed the romantic outcast:<br/><br/>"Hello, Huckleberry!"<br/><br/>"Hello yourself, and see how you like it."<br/><br/>"What's that you got?"<br/><br/>"Dead cat."<br/><br/>
