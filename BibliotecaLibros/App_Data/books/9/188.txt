Early in the forenoon parties of jaded men began to straggle
into the village, but the strongest of the citizens continued
searching. All the news that could be gained was that remotenesses
of the cavern were being ransacked that had never been visited
before; that every corner and crevice was going to be thoroughly
searched; that wherever one wandered through the maze of passages,
lights were to be seen flitting hither and thither in the distance,
and shoutings and pistol-shots sent their hollow reverberations to
the ear down the sombre aisles. In one place, far from the section
usually traversed by tourists, the names "Becky &amp; Tom" had been
found traced upon the rocky wall with candle-smoke, and near at
hand a grease-soiled bit of ribbon. Mrs. Thatcher recognized the
ribbon and cried over it. She said it was the last relic she should
ever have of her child; and that no other memorial of her could
ever be so precious, because this one parted latest from the living
body before the awful death came. Some said that now and then, in
the cave, a far-away speck of light would glimmer, and then a
glorious shout would burst forth and a score of men go trooping
down the echoing aisle — and then a sickening disappointment always
followed; the children were not there; it was only a searcher's
light.

Three dreadful days and nights dragged their tedious hours
along, and the village sank into a hopeless stupor. No one had
heart for anything. The accidental discovery, just made, that the
proprietor of the Temperance Tavern kept liquor on his premises,
scarcely fluttered the public pulse, tremendous as the fact was. In
a lucid interval, Huck feebly led up to the subject of taverns, and
finally asked — dimly dreading the worst — if anything had been
discovered at the Temperance Tavern since he had been ill.

"Yes," said the widow.

Huck started up in bed, wild-eyed:

"What? What was it?"

"Liquor! — and the place has been shut up. Lie down, child —
what a turn you did give me!"

"Only tell me just one thing — only just one — please! Was it
Tom Sawyer that found it?"

The widow burst into tears. "Hush, hush, child, hush! I've told
you before, you must not talk. You are very, very sick!"

Then nothing but liquor had been found; there would have been a
great powwow if it had been the gold. So the treasure was gone
forever — gone forever! But what could she be crying about? Curious
that she should cry.

These thoughts worked their dim way through Huck's mind, and
under the weariness they gave him he fell asleep. The widow said to
herself:

"There — he's asleep, poor wreck. Tom Sawyer find it! Pity but
somebody could find Tom Sawyer! Ah, there ain't many left, now,
that's got hope enough, or strength enough, either, to go on
searching."
