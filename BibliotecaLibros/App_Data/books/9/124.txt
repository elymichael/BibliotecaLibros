"Oh, child, you never think. You never think of anything but
your own selfishness. You could think to come all the way over here
from Jackson's Island in the night to laugh at our troubles, and
you could think to fool me with a lie about a dream; but you
couldn't ever think to pity us and save us from sorrow."

"Auntie, I know now it was mean, but I didn't mean to be mean. I
didn't, honest. And besides, I didn't come over here to laugh at
you that night."

"What did you come for, then?"

"It was to tell you not to be uneasy about us, because we hadn't
got drownded."

"Tom, Tom, I would be the thankfullest soul in this world if I
could believe you ever had as good a thought as that, but you know
you never did — and I know it, Tom."

"Indeed and 'deed I did, auntie — I wish I may never stir if I
didn't."

"Oh, Tom, don't lie — don't do it. It only makes things a
hundred times worse."

"It ain't a lie, auntie; it's the truth. I wanted to keep you
from grieving — that was all that made me come."

"I'd give the whole world to believe that — it would cover up a
power of sins, Tom. I'd 'most be glad you'd run off and acted so
bad. But it ain't reasonable; because, why didn't you tell me,
child?"

"Why, you see, when you got to talking about the funeral, I just
got all full of the idea of our coming and hiding in the church,
and I couldn't somehow bear to spoil it. So I just put the bark
back in my pocket and kept mum."

"What bark?"
