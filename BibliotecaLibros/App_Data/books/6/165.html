"That's right, that's right," returned the sailor, who was not<br/>pleased whenever he heard his chase made light of. "You like to<br/>make objections. Seven months ago, when we landed on the island,<br/>you would have been only too glad to have met with such game!"<br/><br/>"Well, well," replied the reporter, "man is never perfect, nor<br/>contented."<br/><br/>"Now," said Pencroft, "I hope that Neb will distinguish himself.<br/>Look here! These two little peccaries are not more than three<br/>months old! They will be as tender as quails! Come along, Neb,<br/>come! I will look after the cooking myself."<br/><br/>And the sailor, followed by Neb, entered the kitchen, where they<br/>were soon absorbed in their culinary labors.<br/><br/>They were allowed to do it in their own way. Neb, therefore,<br/>prepared a magnificent repastâ€”the two little peccaries, kangaroo<br/>soup, a smoked ham, stone-pine almonds, Oswego tea; in fact, all<br/>the best that they had, but among all the dishes figured in the<br/>first rank the savory peccaries.<br/><br/>At five o'clock dinner was served in the dining-room of Granite<br/>House. The kangaroo soup was smoking on the table. They found it<br/>excellent.<br/><br/>To the soup succeeded the peccaries, which Pencroft insisted on<br/>carving himself, and of which he served out monstrous portions to<br/>each of the guests.<br/><br/>These suckling-pigs were really delicious, and Pencroft was<br/>devouring his share with great gusto, when all at once a cry and an<br/>oath escaped him.<br/><br/>"What's the matter?" asked Cyrus Harding.<br/><br/>"The matter? the matter is that I have just broken a tooth!"<br/>replied the sailor.<br/><br/>"What, are there pebbles in your peccaries?" said Gideon<br/>Spilett.<br/>
