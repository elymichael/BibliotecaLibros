The engineer was silent.

"Well, sir?"

"It is not for me to judge you, Captain Nemo," answered Cyrus
Harding, "at any rate as regards your past life. I am, with the
rest of the world, ignorant of the motives which induced you to
adopt this strange mode of existence, and I cannot judge of effects
without knowing their causes; but what I do know is, that a
beneficent hand has constantly protected us since our arrival on
Lincoln Island, that we all owe our lives to a good, generous, and
powerful being, and that this being so powerful, good and generous,
Captain Nemo, is yourself!"

"It is I," answered the captain simply.

The engineer and the reporter rose. Their companions had drawn
near, and the gratitude with which their hearts were charged was
about to express itself in their gestures and words.

Captain Nemo stopped them by a sign, and in a voice which
betrayed more emotion than he doubtless intended to show.

"Wait till you have heard all," he said.

And the captain, in a few concise sentences, ran over the events
of his life.

His narrative was short, yet he was obliged to summon up his
whole remaining energy to arrive at the end. He was evidently
contending against extreme weakness. Several times Cyrus Harding
entreated him to repose for a while, but he shook his head as a man
to whom the morrow may never come, and when the reporter offered
his assistance,â€”

"It is useless," he said; "my hours are numbered."

Captain Nemo was an Indian, the Prince Dakkar, son of a rajah of
the then independent territory of Bundelkund. His father sent him,
when ten years of age, to Europe, in order that he might receive an
education in all respects complete, and in the hopes that by his
talents and knowledge he might one day take a leading part in
raising his long degraded and heathen country to a level with the
nations of Europe.
