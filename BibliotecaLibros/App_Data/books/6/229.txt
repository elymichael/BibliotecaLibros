The poultry-yard occupied an area of two hundred square yards,
on the southeastern bank of the lake. It was surrounded by a
palisade, and in it were constructed various shelters for the birds
which were to populate it. These were simply built of branches and
divided into compartments, made ready for the expected guests.

The first were the two tinamous, which were not long in having a
number of young ones; they had for companions half a dozen ducks,
accustomed to the borders of the lake. Some belonged to the Chinese
species, of which the wings open like a fan, and which by the
brilliancy of their plumage rival the golden pheasants. A few days
afterwards, Herbert snared a couple of gallinaceae, with spreading
tails composed of long feathers, magnificent alectors, which soon
became tame. As to pelicans, kingfishers, water-hens, they came of
themselves to the shores of the poultry-yard, and this little
community, after some disputes, cooing, screaming, clucking, ended
by settling down peacefully, and increased in encouraging
proportion for the future use of the colony.

Cyrus Harding, wishing to complete his performance, established
a pigeon- house in a corner of the poultry-yard. There he lodged a
dozen of those pigeons which frequented the rocks of the plateau.
These birds soon became accustomed to returning every evening to
their new dwelling, and showed more disposition to domesticate
themselves than their congeners, the wood- pigeons.

Lastly, the time had come for turning the balloon-case to use,
by cutting it up to make shirts and other articles; for as to
keeping it in its present form, and risking themselves in a balloon
filled with gas, above a sea of the limits of which they had no
idea, it was not to be thought of.

It was necessary to bring the case to Granite House, and the
colonists employed themselves in rendering their heavy cart lighter
and more manageable. But though they had a vehicle, the moving
power was yet to be found.

But did there not exist in the island some animal which might
supply the place of the horse, ass, or ox? That was the
question.

"Certainly," said Pencroft, "a beast of burden would be very
useful to us until the captain has made a steam cart, or even an
engine, for some day we shall have a railroad from Granite House to
Port Balloon, with a branch line to Mount Franklin!"

One day, the 23rd of December, Neb and Top were heard shouting
and barking, each apparently trying to see who could make the most
noise. The settlers, who were busy at the Chimneys, ran, fearing
some vexatious incident.

What did they see? Two fine animals of a large size that had
imprudently ventured on the plateau, when the bridges were open.
One would have said they were horses, or at least donkeys, male and
female, of a fine shape, dove-colored, the legs and tail white,
striped with black on the head and neck. They advanced quietly
without showing any uneasiness, and gazed at the men, in whom they
could not as yet recognize their future masters.

"These are onagers!" cried Herbert, "animals something between
the zebra and the quagga!"
