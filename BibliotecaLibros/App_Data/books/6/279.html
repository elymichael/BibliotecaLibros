<br/>"Land!" shouted Pencroft at about six o'clock in the<br/>morning.<br/><br/>And it was impossible that Pencroft should be mistaken, it was<br/>evident that land was there. Imagine the joy of the little crew of<br/>the "Bonadventure." In a few hours they would land on the beach of<br/>the island!<br/><br/>The low coast of Tabor Island, scarcely emerging from the sea,<br/>was not more than fifteen miles distant.<br/><br/>The head of the "Bonadventure," which was a little to the south<br/>of the island, was set directly towards it, and as the sun mounted<br/>in the east, its rays fell upon one or two headlands.<br/><br/>"This is a much less important isle than Lincoln Island,"<br/>observed Herbert, "and is probably due like ours to some submarine<br/>convulsion."<br/><br/>At eleven o'clock the "Bonadventure" was not more than two miles<br/>off, and Pencroft, while looking for a suitable place at which to<br/>land, proceeded very cautiously through the unknown waters. The<br/>whole of the island could now be surveyed, and on it could be seen<br/>groups of gum and other large trees, of the same species as those<br/>growing on Lincoln Island. But the astonishing thing was that no<br/>smoke arose to show that the island was inhabited, no signal<br/>whatever appeared on the shore!<br/><br/>And yet the document was clear enough; there was a castaway, and<br/>this castaway should have been on the watch.<br/><br/>In the meanwhile the "Bonadventure" entered the winding channels<br/>among the reefs, and Pencroft observed every turn with extreme<br/>care. He had put Herbert at the helm, posting himself in the bows,<br/>inspecting the water, while he held the halliard in his hand, ready<br/>to lower the sail at a moment's notice. Gideon Spilett with his<br/>glass eagerly scanned the shore, though without perceiving<br/>anything.<br/><br/>However, at about twelve o'clock the keel of the "Bonadventure"<br/>grated on the bottom. The anchor was let go, the sails furled, and<br/>the crew of the little vessel landed.<br/><br/>And there was no reason to doubt that this was Tabor Island,<br/>since according to the most recent charts there was no island in<br/>this part of the Pacific between New Zealand and the American<br/>Coast.<br/><br/>
