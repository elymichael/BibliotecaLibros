It was now exactly seven months since the balloon voyagers had
been thrown on Lincoln Island. During that time, notwithstanding
the researches they had made, no human being had been discovered.
No smoke even had betrayed the presence of man on the surface of
the island. No vestiges of his handiwork showed that either at an
early or at a late period had man lived there. Not only did it now
appear to be uninhabited by any but themselves, but the colonists
were compelled to believe that it never had been inhabited. And
now, all this scaffolding of reasonings fell before a simple ball
of metal, found in the body of an inoffensive rodent! In fact, this
bullet must have issued from a firearm, and who but a human being
could have used such a weapon?

When Pencroft had placed the bullet on the table, his companions
looked at it with intense astonishment. All the consequences likely
to result from this incident, notwithstanding its apparent
insignificance, immediately took possession of their minds. The
sudden apparition of a supernatural being could not have startled
them more completely.

Cyrus Harding did not hesitate to give utterance to the
suggestions which this fact, at once surprising and unexpected,
could not fail to raise in his mind. He took the bullet, turned it
over and over, rolled it between his finger and thumb; then,
turning to Pencroft, he asked,â€”

Are you sure that the peccary wounded by this bullet was not
more than three months old?"

"Not more, captain," replied Pencroft. "It was still sucking its
mother when I found it in the trap."

"Well," said the engineer, "that proves that within three months
a gun- shot was fired in Lincoln Island."
