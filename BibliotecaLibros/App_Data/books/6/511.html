<br/>"The subterranean fires have therefore been smoldering for ten<br/>weeks," resumed Gideon Spilett, "and it is not to be wondered at<br/>that they now break out with such violence!"<br/><br/>"Do not you feel a certain vibration of the soil?" asked Cyrus<br/>Harding.<br/><br/>"Yes," replied Gideon Spilett, "but there is a great difference<br/>between that and an earthquake."<br/><br/>"I do not affirm that we are menaced with an earthquake,"<br/>answered Cyrus Harding, "may God preserve us from that! No; these<br/>vibrations are due to the effervescence of the central fire. The<br/>crust of the earth is simply the shell of a boiler, and you know<br/>that such a shell, under the pressure of steam, vibrates like a<br/>sonorous plate. it is this effect which is being produced at this<br/>moment."<br/><br/>"What magnificent flames!" exclaimed Herbert.<br/><br/>At this instant a kind of bouquet of flames shot forth from the<br/>crater, the brilliancy of which was visible even through the<br/>vapors. Thousands of luminous sheets and barbed tongues of fire<br/>were cast in various directions. Some, extending beyond the dome of<br/>smoke, dissipated it, leaving behind an incandescent powder. This<br/>was accompanied by successive explosions, resembling the discharge<br/>of a battery of machine-guns.<br/><br/>Cyrus Harding, the reporter, and Herbert, after spending an hour<br/>on the plateau of Prospect Heights, again descended to the beach,<br/>and returned to Granite House. The engineer was thoughtful and<br/>preoccupied, so much so, indeed, that Gideon Spilett inquired if he<br/>apprehended any immediate danger, of which the eruption might<br/>directly or indirectly be the cause.<br/><br/>"Yes, and no," answered Cyrus Harding.<br/><br/>"Nevertheless," continued the reporter, "would not the greatest<br/>misfortune which could happen to us be an earthquake which would<br/>overturn the island? Now, I do not suppose that this is to be<br/>feared, since the vapors and lava have found a free outlet."<br/><br/>"True," replied Cyrus Harding, "and I do not fear an earthquake<br/>in the sense in which the term is commonly applied to convulsions<br/>of the soil provoked by the expansion of subterranean gases. But<br/>other causes may produce great disasters."<br/><br/>
