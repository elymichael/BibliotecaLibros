"Do not make us lose it, my friend."<br/><br/>Pencroft was silent, but a reaction set in, and great tears<br/>rolled down his cheeks.<br/><br/>In the meanwhile, Gideon Spilett endeavored to collect his<br/>ideas, and proceed methodically. After his examination he had no<br/>doubt that the ball, entering in front, between the seventh and<br/>eighth ribs, had issued behind between the third and fourth. But<br/>what mischief had the ball committed in its passage? What important<br/>organs had been reached? A professional surgeon would have had<br/>difficulty in determining this at once, and still more so the<br/>reporter.<br/><br/>However, he knew one thing, this was that he would have to<br/>prevent the inflammatory strangulation of the injured parts, then<br/>to contend with the local inflammation and fever which would result<br/>from the wound, perhaps mortal! Now, what styptics, what<br/>antiphiogistics ought to be employed? By what means could<br/>inflammation be prevented?<br/><br/>At any rate, the most important thing was that the two wounds<br/>should be dressed without delay. It did not appear necessary to<br/>Gideon Spilett that a fresh flow of blood should be caused by<br/>bathing them in tepid water, and compressing their lips. The<br/>hemorrhage had been very abundant, and Herbert was already too much<br/>enfeebled by the loss of blood.<br/><br/>The reporter, therefore, thought it best to simply bathe the two<br/>wounds with cold water.<br/><br/>Herbert was placed on his left side, and was maintained in that<br/>position.<br/><br/>"He must not be moved." said Gideon Spilett. "He is in the most<br/>favorable position for the wounds in his back and chest to<br/>suppurate easily, and absolute rest is necessary."<br/><br/>"What! can't we carry him to Granite House?" asked Pencroft.<br/><br/>"No, Pencroft," replied the reporter.<br/><br/>"I'll pay the villains off!" cried the sailor, shaking his fist<br/>in a menacing manner.<br/>
