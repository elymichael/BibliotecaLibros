"Farewell, then!" he cried, and fled like a madman.<br/><br/>Neb, Pencroft, and Herbert ran also towards the edge of the<br/>wood—but they returned alone.<br/><br/>"We must let him alone!" said Cyrus Harding.<br/><br/>"He will never come back!" exclaimed Pencroft.<br/><br/>"He will come back," replied the engineer.<br/><br/>Many days passed; but Harding—was it a sort of presentiment?<br/>—presentiment in the fixed idea that sooner or later the unhappy<br/>man would return.<br/><br/>"It is the last revolt of his wild nature," said he, "which<br/>remorse has touched, and which renewed solitude will terrify."<br/><br/>In the meanwhile, works of all sorts were continued, as well on<br/>Prospect Heights as at the corral, where Harding intended to build<br/>a farm. It is unnecessary to say that the seeds collected by<br/>Herbert on Tabor Island had been carefully sown. The plateau thus<br/>formed one immense kitchen-garden, well laid out and carefully<br/>tended, so that the arms of the settlers were never in want of<br/>work. There was always something to be done. As the esculents<br/>increased in number, it became necessary to enlarge the simple<br/>beds, which threatened to grow into regular fields and replace the<br/>meadows. But grass abounded in other parts of the island, and there<br/>was no fear of the onagers being obliged to go on short allowance.<br/>It was well worth while, besides, to turn Prospect Heights into a<br/>kitchen-garden, defended by its deep belt of creeks, and to remove<br/>them to the meadows, which had no need of protection against the<br/>depredations of quadrumana and quadrapeds.<br/><br/>On the 15th of November, the third harvest was gathered in. How<br/>wonderfully had the field increased in extent, since eighteen<br/>months ago, when the first grain of wheat was sown! The second crop<br/>of six hundred thousand grains produced this time four thousand<br/>bushels, or five hundred millions of grains!<br/><br/>The colony was rich in corn, for ten bushels alone were<br/>sufficient for sowing every year to produce an ample crop for the<br/>food both of men and beasts. The harvest was completed, and the<br/>last fortnight of the month of November was devoted to the work of<br/>converting it into food for man. In fact, they had corn, but not<br/>flour, and the establishment of a mill was necessary. Cyrus Harding<br/>could have utilized the second fall which flowed into the Mercy to<br/>establish his motive power, the first being already occupied with<br/>moving the felting mill, but, after some consultation, it was<br/>decided that a simple windmill should be built on Prospect Heights.<br/>The building of this presented no more difficulty than the building<br/>of the former, and it was moreover certain that there would be no<br/>want of wind on the plateau, exposed as it was to the sea<br/>breezes.<br/><br/>"Not to mention," said Pencroft, "that the windmill will be more<br/>lively and will have a good effect in the landscape!"<br/>
