<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>8<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>The first week of January was devoted to the manufacture of the<br/>linen garments required by the colony. The needles found in the box<br/>were used by sturdy if not delicate fingers, and we may be sure<br/>that what was sewn was sewn firmly.<br/><br/>There was no lack of thread, thanks to Cyrus Harding's idea of<br/>re- employing that which had been already used in the covering of<br/>the balloon. This with admirable patience was all unpicked by<br/>Gideon Spilett and Herbert, for Pencroft had been obliged to give<br/>this work up, as it irritated him beyond measure; but he had no<br/>equal in the sewing part of the business. Indeed, everybody knows<br/>that sailors have a remarkable aptitude for tailoring.<br/><br/>The cloth of which the balloon-case was made was then cleaned by<br/>means of soda and potash, obtained by the incineration of plants,<br/>in such a way that the cotton, having got rid of the varnish,<br/>resumed its natural softness and elasticity; then, exposed to the<br/>action of the atmosphere, it soon became perfectly white. Some<br/>dozen shirts and sock—the latter not knitted, of course, but made<br/>of cotton—were thus manufactured. What a comfort it was to the<br/>settlers to clothe themselves again in clean linen, which was<br/>doubtless rather rough, but they were not troubled about that! and<br/>then to go to sleep between sheets, which made the couches at<br/>Granite House into quite comfortable beds!<br/><br/>It was about this time also that they made boots of<br/>seal-leather, which were greatly needed to replace the shoes and<br/>boots brought from America. We may be sure that these new shoes<br/>were large enough and never pinched the feet of the wearers.<br/><br/>With the beginning of the year 1866 the heat was very great, but<br/>the hunting in the forests did not stand still. Agouties,<br/>peccaries, capybaras, kangaroos, game of all sorts, actually<br/>swarmed there, and Spilett and Herbert were too good marksmen ever<br/>to throw away their shot uselessly.<br/><br/>Cyrus Harding still recommended them to husband the ammunition,<br/>and he took measures to replace the powder and shot which had been<br/>found in the box, and which he wished to reserve for the future.<br/>How did he know where chance might one day cast his companions and<br/>himself in the event of their leaving their domain? They should,<br/>then, prepare for the unknown future by husbanding their ammunition<br/>and by substituting for it some easily renewable substance.<br/><br/>
