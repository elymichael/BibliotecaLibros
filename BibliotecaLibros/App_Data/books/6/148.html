It has been seen that Lincoln Island, although its inhabitants<br/>had as yet only explored a small portion of it, already contributed<br/>to almost all their wants. It was probable that if they hunted into<br/>its most secret recesses, in all the wooded part between the Mercy<br/>and Reptile Point, they would find new treasures.<br/><br/>The settlers in Lincoln Island had still one privation. There<br/>was no want of meat, nor of vegetable products; those ligneous<br/>roots which they had found, when subjected to fermentation, gave<br/>them an acid drink, which was preferable to cold water; they also<br/>made sugar, without canes or beet- roots, by collecting the liquor<br/>which distils from the "acer saceharinum," a son of maple-tree,<br/>which flourishes in all the temperate zones, and of which the<br/>island possessed a great number; they made a very agreeable tea by<br/>employing the herbs brought from the warren; lastly, they had an<br/>abundance of salt, the only mineral which is used in food&#160;…<br/>but bread was wanting.<br/><br/>Perhaps in time the settlers could replace this want by some<br/>equivalent, it was possible that they might find the sago or the<br/>breadfruit tree among the forests of the south, but they had not as<br/>yet met with these precious trees. However, Providence came<br/>directly to their aid, in an infinitesimal proportion it is true,<br/>but Cyrus Harding, with all his intelligence, all his ingenuity,<br/>would never have been able to produce that which, by the greatest<br/>chance, Herbert one day found in the lining of his waistcoat, which<br/>he was occupied in setting to rights.<br/><br/>On this day, as it was raining in torrents, the settlers were<br/>assembled in the great hall in Granite House, when the lad cried<br/>out all at once,—<br/><br/>"Look here, captain—A grain of corn!"<br/><br/>And he showed his companions a grain—a single grain—which from a<br/>hole in his pocket had got into the lining of his waistcoat.<br/><br/>The presence of this grain was explained by the fact that<br/>Herbert, when at Richmond, used to feed some pigeons, of which<br/>Pencroft had made him a present.<br/><br/>"A grain of corn?" said the engineer quickly.<br/><br/>"Yes, captain; but one, only one!"<br/><br/>"Well, my boy," said Pencroft, laughing, "we're getting on<br/>capitally, upon my word! What shall we make with one grain of<br/>corn?"<br/><br/>"We will make bread of it," replied Cyrus Harding.<br/>
