"And we will call it?â€”" asked Herbert.

"Granite House," replied Harding; a name which his companions
again saluted with a cheer.

The torches were now almost consumed, and as they were obliged
to return by the passage to reach the summit of the plateau, it was
decided to put off the work necessary for the arrangement of their
new dwelling till the next day.

Before departing, Cyrus Harding leaned once more over the dark
well, which descended perpendicularly to the level of the sea. He
listened attentively. No noise was heard, not even that of the
water, which the undulations of the surge must sometimes agitate in
its depths. A flaming branch was again thrown in. The sides of the
well were lighted up for an instant, but as at the first time,
nothing suspicious was seen.

If some marine monster had been surprised unawares by the
retreat of the water, he would by this time have regained the sea
by the subterranean passage, before the new opening had been
offered to him.

Meanwhile, the engineer was standing motionless, his eyes fixed
on the gulf, without uttering a word.

The sailor approached him, and touching his arm, "Captain!" said
he.

"What do you want, my friend?" asked the engineer, as if he had
returned from the land of dreams.

"The torches will soon go out."

"Forward!" replied Cyrus Harding.

The little band left the cavern and began to ascend through the
dark passage. Top closed the rear, still growling every now and
then. The ascent was painful enough. The settlers rested a few
minutes in the upper grotto, which made a sort of landing-place
halfway up the long granite staircase. Then they began to climb
again.
