"'A Scotchman like yourself, my lord,' replied the man; 'I am<br/>one of Captain Grant's crew—one of the castaways of the<br/>"Britannia."'<br/><br/>"This man was called Ayrton. He was, in fact, the boatswain's<br/>mate of the 'Britannia,' as his papers showed. But, separated from<br/>Captain Grant at the moment when the ship struck upon the rocks, he<br/>had till then believed that the captain with all his crew had<br/>perished, and that he, Ayrton, was the sole survivor of the<br/>'Britannia.'<br/><br/>"'Only,' he added, 'it was not on the west coast, but on the<br/>east coast of Australia that the vessel was lost, and if Captain<br/>Grant is still living, as his document indicates, he is a prisoner<br/>among the natives, and it is on the other coast that he must be<br/>looked for.'<br/><br/>"This man spoke in a frank voice and with a confident look; his<br/>words could not be doubted. The irishman, in whose service he had<br/>been for more than a year, answered for his trustworthiness. Lord<br/>Glenarvan, therefore, believed in the fidelity of this man and, by<br/>his advice, resolved to cross Australia, following the<br/>thirty-seventh parallel. Lord Glenarvan, his wife, the two<br/>children, the major, the Frenchman, Captain Mangles, and a few<br/>sailors composed the little band under the command of Ayrton, while<br/>the 'Duncan,' under charge of the mate, Tom Austin, proceeded to<br/>Melbourne, there to await Lord Glenarvan's instructions.<br/><br/>"They set out on the 23rd of December, 1854.<br/><br/>"It is time to say that Ayrton was a traitor. He was, indeed,<br/>the boatswain's mate of the 'Britannia,' but, after some dispute<br/>with his captain, he endeavored to incite the crew to mutiny and<br/>seize the ship, and Captain Grant had landed him, on the 8th of<br/>April, 1852, on the west coast of Australia, and then sailed,<br/>leaving him there, as was only just.<br/><br/>"Therefore this wretched man knew nothing of the wreck of the<br/>'Britannia'; he had just heard of it from Glenarvan's account.<br/>Since his abandonment, he had become, under the name of Ben Joyce,<br/>the leader of the escaped convicts; and if he boldly maintained<br/>that the wreck had taken place on the east coast, and led Lord<br/>Glenarvan to proceed in that direction, it was that he hoped to<br/>separate him from his ship, seize the 'Duncan,' and make the yacht<br/>a pirate in the Pacific."<br/><br/>Here the stranger stopped for a moment. His voice trembled, but<br/>he continued,—<br/><br/>"The expedition set out and proceeded across Australia. It was<br/>inevitably unfortunate, since Ayrton, or Ben Joyce, as he may be<br/>called, guided it, sometimes preceded, sometimes followed by his<br/>band of convicts, who had been told what they had to do.<br/><br/>"Meanwhile, the 'Duncan' had been sent to Melbourne for repairs.<br/>It was necessary, then, to get Lord Glenarvan to order her to leave<br/>Melbourne and go to the east coast of Australia, where it would be<br/>easy to seize her. After having led the expedition near enough to<br/>the coast, in the midst of vast forests with no resources, Ayrton<br/>obtained a letter, which he was charged to carry to the mate of the<br/>'Duncan'—a letter which ordered the yacht to repair immediately to<br/>the east coast, to Twofold Bay, that is to say a few days' journey<br/>from the place where the expedition had stopped. It was there that<br/>Ayrton had agreed to meet his accomplices, and two days after<br/>gaining possession of the letter, he arrived at Melbourne.<br/><br/>"So far the villain had succeeded in his wicked design. He would<br/>be able to take the 'Duncan' into Twofold Bay, where it would be<br/>easy for the convicts to seize her, and her crew massacred, Ben<br/>Joyce would become master of the seas. But it pleased God to<br/>prevent the accomplishment of these terrible projects.<br/>
