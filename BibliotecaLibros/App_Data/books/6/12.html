Gideon Spilett was tall. He was rather more than forty years of<br/>age. Light whiskers bordering on red surrounded his face. His eye<br/>was steady, lively, rapid in its changes. It was the eye of a man<br/>accustomed to take in at a glance all the details of a scene. Well<br/>built, he was inured to all climates, like a bar of steel hardened<br/>in cold water.<br/><br/>For ten years Gideon Spilett had been the reporter of the New<br/>York Herald, which he enriched by his letters and drawings, for he<br/>was as skilful in the use of the pencil as of the pen. When he was<br/>captured, he was in the act of making a description and sketch of<br/>the battle. The last words in his note-book were these: "A Southern<br/>rifleman has just taken aim at me, but—" The Southerner<br/>notwithstanding missed Gideon Spilett, who, with his usual fortune,<br/>came out of this affair without a scratch.<br/><br/>Cyrus Harding and Gideon Spilett, who did not know each other<br/>except by reputation, had both been carried to Richmond. The<br/>engineer's wounds rapidly healed, and it was during his<br/>convalescence that he made acquaintance with the reporter. The two<br/>men then learned to appreciate each other. Soon their common aim<br/>had but one object, that of escaping, rejoining Grant's army, and<br/>fighting together in the ranks of the Federals.<br/><br/>The two Americans had from the first determined to seize every<br/>chance; but although they were allowed to wander at liberty in the<br/>town, Richmond was so strictly guarded, that escape appeared<br/>impossible. In the meanwhile Captain Harding was rejoined by a<br/>servant who was devoted to him in life and in death. This intrepid<br/>fellow was a Negro born on the engineer's estate, of a slave father<br/>and mother, but to whom Cyrus, who was an Abolitionist from<br/>conviction and heart, had long since given his freedom. The once<br/>slave, though free, would not leave his master. He would have died<br/>for him. He was a man of about thirty, vigorous, active, clever,<br/>intelligent, gentle, and calm, sometimes naive, always merry,<br/>obliging, and honest. His name was Nebuchadnezzar, but he only<br/>answered to the familiar abbreviation of Neb.<br/><br/>When Neb heard that his master had been made prisoner, he left<br/>Massachusetts without hesitating an instant, arrived before<br/>Richmond, and by dint of stratagem and shrewdness, after having<br/>risked his life twenty times over, managed to penetrate into the<br/>besieged town. The pleasure of Harding on seeing his servant, and<br/>the joy of Neb at finding his master, can scarcely be<br/>described.<br/><br/>But though Neb had been able to make his way into Richmond, it<br/>was quite another thing to get out again, for the Northern<br/>prisoners were very strictly watched. Some extraordinary<br/>opportunity was needed to make the attempt with any chance of<br/>success, and this opportunity not only did not present itself, but<br/>was very difficult to find.<br/><br/>Meanwhile Grant continued his energetic operations. The victory<br/>of Petersburg had been very dearly bought. His forces, united to<br/>those of Butler, had as yet been unsuccessful before Richmond, and<br/>nothing gave the prisoners any hope of a speedy deliverance.<br/><br/>The reporter, to whom his tedious captivity did not offer a<br/>single incident worthy of note, could stand it no longer. His<br/>usually active mind was occupied with one sole thought—how he might<br/>get out of Richmond at any cost. Several times had he even made the<br/>attempt, but was stopped by some insurmountable obstacle. However,<br/>the siege continued; and if the prisoners were anxious to escape<br/>and join Grant's army, certain of the besieged were no less anxious<br/>to join the Southern forces. Among them was one Jonathan Forster, a<br/>determined Southerner. The truth was, that if the prisoners of the<br/>Secessionists could not leave the town, neither could the<br/>Secessionists themselves while the Northern army invested it. The<br/>Governor of Richmond for a long time had been unable to communicate<br/>with General Lee, and he very much wished to make known to him the<br/>situation of the town, so as to hasten the march of the army to<br/>their relief. Thus Jonathan Forster accordingly conceived the idea<br/>of rising in a balloon, so as to pass over the besieging lines, and<br/>in that way reach the Secessionist camp.<br/><br/>The Governor authorized the attempt. A balloon was manufactured<br/>and placed at the disposal of Forster, who was to be accompanied by<br/>five other persons. They were furnished with arms in case they<br/>might have to defend themselves when they alighted, and provisions<br/>in the event of their aerial voyage being prolonged.<br/><br/>The departure of the balloon was fixed for the 18th of March. It<br/>should be effected during the night, with a northwest wind of<br/>moderate force, and the aeronauts calculated that they would reach<br/>General Lee's camp in a few hours.<br/><br/>But this northwest wind was not a simple breeze. From the 18th<br/>it was evident that it was changing to a hurricane. The tempest<br/>soon became such that Forster's departure was deferred, for it was<br/>impossible to risk the balloon and those whom it carried in the<br/>midst of the furious elements.<br/>
