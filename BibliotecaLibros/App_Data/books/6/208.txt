"Well," said Gideon Spilett, "it seems we must make up our minds
to console ourselves with thinking that no one will come to dispute
with us the possession of Lincoln Island!"

"But the bullet," cried Herbert. "That was not imaginary, I
suppose!"

"Hang it, no!" exclaimed Pencroft, thinking of his absent
tooth.

"Then what conclusion may be drawn?" asked the reporter.

"This," replied the engineer, "that three months or more ago, a
vessel, either voluntarily or not, came here."

"What! then you admit, Cyrus, that she was swallowed up without
leaving any trace?" cried the reporter.

"No, my dear Spilett; but you see that if it is certain that a
human being set foot on the island, it appears no less certain that
he has now left it."

"Then, if I understand you right, captain," said Herbert, "the
vessel has left again?"

"Evidently."

"And we have lost an opportunity to get back to our country?"
said Neb.

"I fear so."
