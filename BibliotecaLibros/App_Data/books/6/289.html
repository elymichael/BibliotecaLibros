<br/>"We won't waste time," returned Pencroft. "You, Herbert, go and<br/>gather the seeds, which you know better than we do. While you do<br/>that, Mr. Spilett and I will go and have a pig hunt, and even<br/>without Top I hope we shall manage to catch a few!"<br/><br/>Herbert accordingly took the path which led towards the<br/>cultivated part of the islet, while the sailor and the reporter<br/>entered the forest.<br/><br/>Many specimens of the porcine race fled before them, and these<br/>animals, which were singularly active, did not appear to be in a<br/>humor to allow themselves to be approached.<br/><br/>However, after an hour's chase, the hunters had just managed to<br/>get hold of a couple lying in a thicket, when cries were heard<br/>resounding from the north part of the island, With the cries were<br/>mingled terrible yells, in which there was nothing human.<br/><br/>Pencroft and Gideon Spilett were at once on their feet, and the<br/>pigs by this movement began to run away, at the moment when the<br/>sailor was getting ready the rope to bind them.<br/><br/>"That's Herbert's voice," said the reporter.<br/><br/>"Run!" exclaimed Pencroft.<br/><br/>And the sailor and Spilett immediately ran at full speed towards<br/>the spot from whence the cries proceeded.<br/><br/>They did well to hasten, for at a turn of the path near a<br/>clearing they saw the lad thrown on the ground and in the grasp of<br/>a savage being, apparently a gigantic ape, who was about to do him<br/>some great harm.<br/><br/>To rush on this monster, throw him on the ground in his turn,<br/>snatch Herbert from him, then bind him securely, was the work of a<br/>minute for Pencroft and Gideon Spilett. The sailor was of Herculean<br/>strength, the reporter also very powerful, and in spite of the<br/>monster's resistance he was firmly tied so that he could not even<br/>move.<br/><br/>
