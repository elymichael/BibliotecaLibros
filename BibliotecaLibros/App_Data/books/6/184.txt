"Nothing is wanting, indeed," murmured Cyrus Harding
thoughtfully.

"And for a certainty," added Herbert, "the vessel which carried
this chest and its owner was not a Malay pirate!"

"Unless," said Pencroft, "the owner had been taken prisoner by
pirates—"

"That is not admissible," replied the reporter. "It is more
probable that an American or European vessel has been driven into
this quarter, and that her passengers, wishing to save necessaries
at least, prepared this chest and threw it overboard."

"Is that your opinion, captain?" asked Herbert.

"Yes, my boy," replied the engineer, "that may have been the
case. It is possible that at the moment, or in expectation of a
wreck, they collected into this chest different articles of the
greatest use in hopes of finding it again on the coast—"

"Even the photographic box!" exclaimed the sailor
incredulously.

"As to that apparatus," replied Harding, "I do not quite see the
use of it; and a more complete supply of clothes or more abundant
ammunition would have been more valuable to us as well as to any
other castaways!"

"But isn't there any mark or direction on these instruments,
tools, or books, which would tell us something about them?" asked
Gideon Spilett.

That might be ascertained. Each article was carefully examined,
especially the books, instruments and weapons. Neither the weapons
nor the instruments, contrary to the usual custom, bore the name of
the maker; they were, besides, in a perfect state, and did not
appear to have been used. The same peculiarity marked the tools and
utensils; all were new, which proved that the articles had not been
taken by chance and thrown into the chest, but, on the contrary,
that the choice of things had been well considered and arranged
with care. This was also indicated by the second case of metal
which had preserved them from damp, and which could not have been
soldered in a moment of haste.
