"Who came here the last time?" asked the engineer.

"I did, captain," answered Ayrton.

"And that was—"

"Four days ago."

"Ah! a note!" cried Herbert, pointing to a paper lying on the
table.

On this paper were written these words in English:—

"Follow the new wire."

"Forward!" cried Harding, who understood that the despatch had
not been sent from the corral, but from the mysterious retreat,
communicating directly with Granite House by means of a
supplementary wire joined to the old one.

Neb took the lighted lantern, and all left the corral. The storm
then burst forth with tremendous violence. The interval between
each lightning- flash and each thunder-clap diminished rapidly. The
summit of the volcano, with its plume of vapor, could be seen by
occasional flashes.

There was no telegraphic communication in any part of the corral
between the house and the palisade; but the engineer, running
straight to the first post, saw by the light of a flash a new wire
hanging from the isolator to the ground.
