And Cyrus Harding, hurrying away the reporter and Ayrton, joined<br/>Pencroft, Neb, and Herbert on the beach.<br/><br/>Nothing could be seen of the brig, not even her masts. After<br/>having been raised by the water-spout, she had fallen on her side,<br/>and had sunk in that position, doubtless in consequence of some<br/>enormous leak. But as in that place the channel was not more than<br/>twenty feet in depth, it was certain that the sides of the<br/>submerged brig would reappear at low water.<br/><br/>A few things from the wreck floated on the surface of the water,<br/>a raft could be seen consisting of spare spars, coops of poultry<br/>with their occupants still living, boxes and barrels, which<br/>gradually came to the surface, after having escaped through the<br/>hatchways, but no pieces of the wreck appeared, neither planks from<br/>the deck, nor timber from the hull,â€” which rendered the sudden<br/>disappearance of the "Speedy" perfectly inexplicable.<br/><br/>However, the two masts, which had been broken and escaped from<br/>the shrouds and stays came up, and with their sails, some furled<br/>and the others spread. But it was not necessary to wait for the<br/>tide to bring up these riches, and Ayrton and Pencroft jumped into<br/>the boat with the intention of towing the pieces of wreck either to<br/>the beach or to the islet. But just as they were shoving off, an<br/>observation from Gideon Spilett arrested them.<br/><br/>"What about those six convicts who disembarked on the right bank<br/>of the Mercy?" said he.<br/><br/>In fact, it would not do to forget that the six men whose boat<br/>had gone to pieces on the rocks had landed at Flotsam Point.<br/><br/>They looked in that direction. None of the fugitives were<br/>visible. It was probable that, having seen their vessel engulfed in<br/>the channel, they had fled into the interior of the island.<br/><br/>"We will deal with them later," said Harding. "As they are<br/>armed, they will still be dangerous; but as it is six against six,<br/>the chances are equal. To the most pressing business first."<br/><br/>Ayrton and Pencroft pulled vigorously towards the wreck.<br/><br/>The sea was calm and the tide very high, as there had been a new<br/>moon but two days before. A whole hour at least would elapse before<br/>the hull of the brig could emerge from the water of the<br/>channel.<br/><br/>Ayrton and Pencroft were able to fasten the masts and spars by<br/>means of ropes, the ends of which were carried to the beach. There,<br/>by the united efforts of the settlers the pieces of wreck were<br/>hauled up. Then the boat picked up all that was floating, coops,<br/>barrels, and boxes, which were immediately carried to the<br/>Chimneys.<br/>
