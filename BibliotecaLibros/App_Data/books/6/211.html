<br/>"It is all that remains of our airy boat, of our balloon, which<br/>has been caught up aloft there, at the top of that tree!"<br/><br/>Pencroft was not mistaken, and he gave vent to his feelings in a<br/>tremendous hurrah, adding,â€”<br/><br/>"There is good cloth! There is what will furnish us with linen<br/>for years. There is what will make us handkerchiefs and shirts! Ha,<br/>ha, Mr. Spilett, what do you say to an island where shirts grow on<br/>the trees?"<br/><br/>It was certainly a lucky circumstance for the settlers in<br/>Lincoln Island that the balloon, after having made its last bound<br/>into the air, had fallen on the island and thus given them the<br/>opportunity of finding it again, whether they kept the case under<br/>its present form, or whether they wished to attempt another escape<br/>by it, or whether they usefully employed the several hundred yards<br/>of cotton, which was of fine quality. Pencroft's joy was therefore<br/>shared by all.<br/><br/>But it was necessary to bring down the remains of the balloon<br/>from the tree, to place it in security, and this was no slight<br/>task. Neb, Herbert, and the sailor, climbing to the summit of the<br/>tree, used all their skill to disengage the now reduced<br/>balloon.<br/><br/>The operation lasted two hours, and then not only the case, with<br/>its valve, its springs, its brasswork, lay on the ground, but the<br/>net, that is to say a considerable quantity of ropes and cordage,<br/>and the circle and the anchor. The case, except for the fracture,<br/>was in good condition, only the lower portion being torn.<br/><br/>It was a fortune which had fallen from the sky.<br/><br/>"All the same, captain," said the sailor, "if we ever decide to<br/>leave the island, it won't be in a balloon, will it? These airboats<br/>won't go where we want them to go, and we have had some experience<br/>in that way! Look here, we will build a craft of some twenty tons,<br/>and then we can make a main-sail, a foresail, and a jib out of that<br/>cloth. As to the rest of it, that will help to dress us."<br/><br/>"We shall see, Pencroft," replied Cyrus Harding; "we shall<br/>see."<br/><br/>"In the meantime, we must put it in a safe place," said Neb.<br/><br/>
