Pencroft, to his extreme surprise, found that the terrible storm<br/>had quite altered the aspect of the place. Important changes had<br/>occurred; great blocks of stone lay on the beach, which was also<br/>covered with a thick carpet of sea-weed, algae, and wrack.<br/>Evidently the sea, passing over the islet, had been carried right<br/>up to the foot of the enormous curtain of granite. The soil in<br/>front of the cave had been torn away by the violence of the waves.<br/>A horrid presentiment flashed across Pencroft's mind. He rushed<br/>into the passage, but returned almost immediately, and stood<br/>motionless, staring at his companionsâ€¦ . The fire was out; the<br/>drowned cinders were nothing but mud; the burnt linen, which was to<br/>have served as tinder, had disappeared!
