<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>10<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>Of the convicts, the dangers which menaced Granite House, the<br/>ruins with which the plateau was covered, the colonists thought no<br/>longer. Herbert's critical state outweighed all other<br/>considerations. Would the removal prove fatal to him by causing<br/>some internal injury? The reporter could not affirm it, but he and<br/>his companions almost despaired of the result. The cart was brought<br/>to the bend of the river. There some branches, disposed as a liner,<br/>received the mattress on which lay the unconscious Herbert. Ten<br/>minutes after, Cyrus Harding, Spilett, and Pencroft were at the<br/>foot of the cliff, leaving Neb to take the cart on to the plateau<br/>of Prospect Heights. The lift was put in motion, and Herbert was<br/>soon stretched on his bed in Granite House.<br/><br/>What cares were lavished on him to bring him back to life! He<br/>smiled for a moment on finding himself in his room, but could<br/>scarcely even murmur a few words, so great was his weakness. Gideon<br/>Spilett examined his wounds. He feared to find them reopened,<br/>having been imperfectly healed. There was nothing of the sort. From<br/>whence, then, came this prostration? why was Herbert so much worse?<br/>The lad then fell into a kind of feverish sleep, and the reporter<br/>and Pencroft remained near the bed. During this time, Harding told<br/>Neb all that had happened at the corral, and Neb recounted to his<br/>master the events of which the plateau had just been the<br/>theater.<br/><br/>It was only during the preceding night that the convicts had<br/>appeared on the edge of the forest, at the approaches to Creek<br/>Glycerine. Neb, who was watching near the poultry-yard, had not<br/>hesitated to fire at one of the pirates, who was about to cross the<br/>stream; but in the darkness he could not tell whether the man had<br/>been hit or not. At any rate, it was not enough to frighten away<br/>the band, and Neb had only just time to get up to Granite House,<br/>where at least he was in safety.<br/><br/>But what was he to do there? How prevent the devastations with<br/>which the convicts threatened the plateau? Had Neb any means by<br/>which to warn his master? And, besides, in what situation were the<br/>inhabitants of the corral themselves? Cyrus Harding and his<br/>companions had left on the 11th of November, and it was now the<br/>29th. It was, therefore, nineteen days since Neb had had other news<br/>than that brought by Topâ€”disastrous news: Ayrton disappeared,<br/>Herbert severely wounded, the engineer, reporter, and sailor, as it<br/>were, imprisoned in the corral!<br/><br/>What was he to do? asked poor Neb. Personally he had nothing to<br/>fear, for the convicts could not reach him in Granite House. But<br/>the buildings, the plantations, all their arrangements at the mercy<br/>of the pirates! Would it not be best to let Cyrus Harding judge of<br/>what he ought to do, and to warn him, at least, of the danger which<br/>threatened him?<br/><br/>Neb then thought of employing Jup, and confiding a note to him.<br/>He knew the orang's great intelligence, which had been often put to<br/>the proof. Jup understood the word corral, which had been<br/>frequently pronounced before him, and it may be remembered, too,<br/>that he had often driven the cart thither in company with Pencroft.<br/>Day had not yet dawned. The active orang would know how to pass<br/>unperceived through the woods, of which the convicts, besides,<br/>would think he was a native.<br/><br/>
