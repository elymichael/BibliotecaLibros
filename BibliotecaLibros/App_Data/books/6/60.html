<br/>First of all, Cyrus Harding was carried into the central<br/>passage. There they managed to arrange for him a couch of sea-weed<br/>which still remained almost dry. The deep sleep which had<br/>overpowered him would no doubt be more beneficial to him than any<br/>nourishment.<br/><br/>Night had closed in, and the temperature, which had modified<br/>when the wind shifted to the northwest, again became extremely<br/>cold. Also, the sea having destroyed the partitions which Pencroft<br/>had put up in certain places in the passages, the Chimneys, on<br/>account of the draughts, had become scarcely habitable. The<br/>engineer's condition would, therefore, have been bad enough, if his<br/>companions had not carefully covered him with their coats and<br/>waistcoats.<br/><br/>Supper, this evening, was of course composed of the inevitable<br/>lithodomes, of which Herbert and Neb picked up a plentiful supply<br/>on the beach. However, to these molluscs, the lad added some edible<br/>sea-weed, which he gathered on high rocks, whose sides were only<br/>washed by the sea at the time of high tides. This sea-weed, which<br/>belongs to the order of Fucacae, of the genus Sargassum, produces,<br/>when dry, a gelatinous matter, rich and nutritious. The reporter<br/>and his companions, after having eaten a quantity of lithodomes,<br/>sucked the sargassum, of which the taste was very tolerable. It is<br/>used in parts of the East very considerably by the natives. "Never<br/>mind!" said the sailor, "the captain will help us soon." Meanwhile<br/>the cold became very severe, and unhappily they had no means of<br/>defending themselves from it.<br/><br/>The sailor, extremely vexed, tried in all sorts of ways to<br/>procure fire. Neb helped him in this work. He found some dry moss,<br/>and by striking together two pebbles he obtained some sparks, but<br/>the moss, not being inflammable enough, did not take fire, for the<br/>sparks were really only incandescent, and not at all of the same<br/>consistency as those which are emitted from flint when struck in<br/>the same manner. The experiment, therefore, did not succeed.<br/><br/>Pencroft, although he had no confidence in the proceeding, then<br/>tried rubbing two pieces of dry wood together, as savages do.<br/>Certainly, the movement which he and Neb exhibited, if it had been<br/>transformed into heat, according to the new theory, would have been<br/>enough to heat the boiler of a steamer! It came to nothing. The<br/>bits of wood became hot, to be sure, but much less so than the<br/>operators themselves.<br/><br/>After working an hour, Pencroft, who was in a complete state of<br/>perspiration, threw down the pieces of wood in disgust.<br/><br/>"I can never be made to believe that savages light their fires<br/>in this way, let them say what they will," he exclaimed. "I could<br/>sooner light my arms by rubbing them against each other!"<br/><br/>The sailor was wrong to despise the proceeding. Savages often<br/>kindle wood by means of rapid rubbing. But every sort of wood does<br/>not answer for the purpose, and besides, there is "the knack,"<br/>following the usual expression, and it is probable that Pencroft<br/>had not "the knack."<br/><br/>Pencroft's ill humor did not last long. Herbert had taken the<br/>bits of wood which he had turned down, and was exerting himself to<br/>rub them. The hardy sailor could not restrain a burst of laughter<br/>on seeing the efforts of the lad to succeed where he had<br/>failed.<br/><br/>"Rub, my boy, rub!" said he.<br/><br/>
