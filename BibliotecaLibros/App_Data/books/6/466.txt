"Then the volcano is not totally extinct?" said the
reporter.

"It is possible that since our exploration of the crater,"
replied Cyrus Harding, "some change has occurred. Any volcano,
although considered extinct, may evidently again burst forth."

"But if an eruption of Mount Franklin occurred," asked Spilett,
"would there not be some danger to Lincoln Island?"

"I do not think so," answered the reporter. "The crater, that is
to say, the safety-valve, exists, and the overflow of smoke and
lava, would escape, as it did formerly, by this customary
outlet."

"Unless the lava opened a new way for itself towards the fertile
parts of the island!"

"And why, my dear Spilett," answered Cyrus Harding, "should it
not follow the road naturally traced out for it?"

"Well, volcanoes are capricious," returned the reporter.

"Notice," answered the engineer, "that the inclination of Mount
Franklin favors the flow of water towards the valleys which we are
exploring just now. To turn aside this flow, an earthquake would be
necessary to change the mountain's center of gravity."

"But an earthquake is always to be feared at these times,"
observed Gideon Spilett.

"Always," replied the engineer, "especially when the
subterranean forces begin to awake, as they risk meeting with some
obstruction, after a long rest. Thus, my dear Spilett, an eruption
would be a serious thing for us, and it would be better that the
volcano should not have the slightest desire to wake up. But we
could not prevent it, could we? At any rate, even if it should
occur, I do not think Prospect Heights would he seriously
threatened. Between them and the mountain, the ground is
considerably depressed, and if the lava should ever take a course
towards the lake, it would be cast on the downs and the neighboring
parts of Shark Gulf."

"We have not yet seen any smoke at the top of the mountain, to
indicate an approaching eruption," said Gideon Spilett.
