Several bodies floated also. Among them, Ayrton recognized that
of Bob Harvey, which he pointed out to his companion, saying with
some emotion,â€”

"That is what I have been, Pencroft."

"But what you are no longer, brave Ayrton!" returned the sailor
warmly.

It was singular enough that so few bodies floated. Only five or
six were counted, which were already being carried by the current
towards the open sea. Very probably the convicts had not had time
to escape, and the ship lying over on her side, the greater number
of them had remained below. Now the current, by carrying the bodies
of these miserable men out to sea, would spare the colonists the
sad task of burying them in some corner of their island.

For two hours, Cyrus Harding and his companions were solely
occupied in hauling up the spars on to the sand, and then in
spreading the sails which were perfectly uninjured, to dry. They
spoke little, for they were absorbed in their work, but what
thoughts occupied their minds!

The possession of this brig, or rather all that she contained,
was a perfect mine of wealth. In fact, a ship is like a little
world in miniature, and the stores of the colony would be increased
by a large number of useful articles. It would be, on a large
scale, equivalent to the chest found at Flotsam Point.

"And besides," thought Pencroft, "why should it be impossible to
refloat the brig? If she has only a leak, that may be stopped up; a
vessel from three to four hundred tons, why she is a regular ship
compared to our 'Bonadventure'! And we could go a long distance in
her! We could go anywhere we liked! Captain Harding, Ayrton and I
must examine her! She would be well worth the trouble!"

In fact, if the brig was still fit to navigate, the colonists'
chances of returning to their native land were singularly
increased. But, to decide this important question, it was necessary
to wait until the tide was quite low, so that every part of the
brig's hull might be examined.

When their treasures had been safely conveyed on shore, Harding
and his companions agreed to devote some minutes to breakfast. They
were almost famished; fortunately, the larder was not far off, and
Neb was noted for being an expeditious cook. They breakfasted,
therefore, near the Chimneys, and during their repast, as may be
supposed, nothing was talked of but the event which had so
miraculously saved the colony.

"Miraculous is the word," repeated Pencroft, "for it must be
acknowledged that those rascals blew up just at the right moment!
Granite House was beginning to be uncomfortable as a
habitation!"
