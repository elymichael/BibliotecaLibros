fire.

Top still barked, and Jup, running towards the dog, uttered
shrill cries.

The colonists followed him, and reached the borders of the
little stream, shaded by large trees. And there, in the bright
moonlight, what did they see? Five corpses, stretched on the
bank!

They were those of the convicts who, four months previously, had
landed on Lincoln Island!
