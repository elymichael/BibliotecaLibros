<br/>The engineer remarked this; but although he carefully examined<br/>these points by the light of his lantern, he could find no<br/>impression, no fracture which could give any reason to suppose that<br/>they had either recently or at any former time been used as a<br/>staircase. Cyrus Harding descended deeper, throwing the light of<br/>his lantern on all sides.<br/><br/>He saw nothing suspicious.<br/><br/>When the engineer had reached the last rounds he came upon the<br/>water, which was then perfectly calm. Neither at its level nor in<br/>any other part of the well, did any passage open, which could lead<br/>to the interior of the cliff. The wall which Harding struck with<br/>the hilt of his cutlass sounded solid. It was compact granite,<br/>through which no living being could force a way. To arrive at the<br/>bottom of the well and then climb up to its mouth it was necessary<br/>to pass through the channel under the rocky subsoil of the beach,<br/>which placed it in communication with the sea, and this was only<br/>possible for marine animals. As to the question of knowing where<br/>this channel ended, at what point of the shore, and at what depth<br/>beneath the water, it could not be answered.<br/><br/>Then Cyrus Harding, having ended his survey, re-ascended, drew<br/>up the ladder, covered the mouth of the well, and returned<br/>thoughtfully to the diningroom, saying to himself,â€”<br/><br/>"I have seen nothing, and yet there is something there!"<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
