Sand, stones, twisted branches, wet clay, closed up the<br/>galleries open to the south winds.

Better to have two strings to one's bow<br/>than no string at all!"<br/><br/>"Oh!" exclaimed Herbert, "how jolly it will be if they were to<br/>find Captain Harding and were to bring him back with them!"<br/><br/>"Yes, indeed!" said Pencroft, "that was a man of the right<br/>sort."<br/><br/>"Was!" exclaimed Herbert, "do you despair of ever seeing him<br/>again?"<br/><br/>
