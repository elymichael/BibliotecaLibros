And the "Bonadventure" sailed as near as possible to the rocky<br/>shore. Perhaps some cave, which it would be advisable to explore,<br/>existed there? But Harding saw nothing, not a cavern, not a cleft<br/>which could serve as a retreat to any being whatever, for the foot<br/>of the cliff was washed by the surf. Soon Top's barks ceased, and<br/>the vessel continued her course at a few cables-length from the<br/>coast.<br/><br/>In the northwest part of the island the shore became again flat<br/>and sandy. A few trees here and there rose above a low, marshy<br/>ground, which the colonists had already surveyed, and in violent<br/>contrast to the other desert shore, life was again manifested by<br/>the presence of myriads of water-fowl. That evening the<br/>"Bonadventure" anchored in a small bay to the north of the island,<br/>near the land, such was the depth of water there. The night passed<br/>quietly, for the breeze died away with the last light of day, and<br/>only rose again with the first streaks of dawn.<br/><br/>As it was easy to land, the usual hunters of the colony, that is<br/>to say, Herbert and Gideon Spilett, went for a ramble of two hours<br/>or so, and returned with several strings of wild duck and snipe.<br/>Top had done wonders, and not a bird had been lost, thanks to his<br/>zeal and cleverness.<br/><br/>At eight o'clock in the morning the "Bonadventure" set sail, and<br/>ran rapidly towards North Mandible Cape, for the wind was right<br/>astern and freshening rapidly.<br/><br/>"However," observed Pencroft, "I should not be surprised if a<br/>gale came up from the west. Yesterday the sun set in a very<br/>red-looking horizon, and now, this morning, those mares-tails don't<br/>forbode anything good."<br/><br/>These mares-tails are cirrus clouds, scattered in the zenith,<br/>their height from the sea being less than five thousand feet. They<br/>look like light pieces of cotton wool, and their presence usually<br/>announces some sudden change in the weather.<br/><br/>"Well," said Harding, "let us carry as much sail as possible,<br/>and run for shelter into Shark Gulf. I think that the<br/>'Bonadventure' will be safe there."<br/><br/>"Perfectly," replied Pencroft, "and besides, the north coast is<br/>merely sand, very uninteresting to look at."<br/><br/>"I shall not be sorry," resumed the engineer, "to pass not only<br/>to-night but to-morrow in that bay, which is worth being carefully<br/>explored."<br/><br/>"I think that we shall be obliged to do so, whether we like it<br/>or not," answered Pencroft, "for the sky looks very threatening<br/>towards the west. Dirty weather is coming on!"<br/><br/>"At any rate we have a favorable wind for reaching Cape<br/>Mandible," observed the reporter.<br/>
