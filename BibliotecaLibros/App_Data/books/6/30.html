Herbert did not reply. The loss of the box was certainly to be<br/>regretted, but the boy was still sure of procuring fire in some way<br/>or other. Pencroft, more experienced, did not think so, although he<br/>was not a man to trouble himself about a small or great grievance.<br/>At any rate, there was only one thing to be done—to await the<br/>return of Neb and the reporter; but they must give up the feast of<br/>hard eggs which they had meant to prepare, and a meal of raw flesh<br/>was not an agreeable prospect either for themselves or for the<br/>others.<br/><br/>Before returning to the cave, the sailor and Herbert, in the<br/>event of fire being positively unattainable, collected some more<br/>shell-fish, and then silently retraced their steps to their<br/>dwelling.<br/><br/>Pencroft, his eyes fixed on the ground, still looked for his<br/>box. He even climbed up the left bank of the river from its mouth<br/>to the angle where the raft had been moored. He returned to the<br/>plateau, went over it in every direction, searched among the high<br/>grass on the border of the forest, all in vain.<br/><br/>It was five in the evening when he and Herbert re-entered the<br/>cave. It is useless to say that the darkest corners of the passages<br/>were ransacked before they were obliged to give it up in despair.<br/>Towards six o'clock, when the sun was disappearing behind the high<br/>lands of the west, Herbert, who was walking up and down on the<br/>strand, signalized the return of Neb and Spilett.<br/><br/>They were returning alone!&#160;… . The boy's heart sank; the<br/>sailor had not been deceived in his forebodings; the engineer,<br/>Cyrus Harding, had not been found!<br/><br/>The reporter, on his arrival, sat down on a rock, without saying<br/>anything. Exhausted with fatigue, dying of hunger, he had not<br/>strength to utter a word.<br/><br/>As to Neb, his red eyes showed how he had cried, and the tears<br/>which he could not restrain told too clearly that he had lost all<br/>hope.<br/><br/>The reporter recounted all that they had done in their attempt<br/>to recover Cyrus Harding. He and Neb had surveyed the coast for a<br/>distance of eight miles and consequently much beyond the place<br/>where the balloon had fallen the last time but one, a fall which<br/>was followed by the disappearance of the engineer and the dog Top.<br/>The shore was solitary; not a vestige of a mark. Not even a pebble<br/>recently displaced; not a trace on the sand; not a human footstep<br/>on all that part of the beach. It was clear that that portion of<br/>the shore had never been visited by a human being. The sea was as<br/>deserted as the land, and it was there, a few hundred feet from the<br/>coast, that the engineer must have found a tomb.<br/><br/>As Spilett ended his account, Neb jumped up, exclaiming in a<br/>voice which showed how hope struggled within him, "No! he is not<br/>dead! he can't be dead! It might happen to any one else, but never<br/>to him! He could get out of anything!" Then his strength forsaking<br/>him, "Oh! I can do no more!" he murmured.<br/><br/>"Neb," said Herbert, running to him, "we will find him! God will<br/>give him back to us! But in the meantime you are hungry, and you<br/>must eat something."<br/><br/>So saying, he offered the poor Negro a few handfuls of<br/>shell-fish, which was indeed wretched and insufficient food. Neb<br/>had not eaten anything for several hours, but he refused them. He<br/>could not, would not live without his master.<br/>
