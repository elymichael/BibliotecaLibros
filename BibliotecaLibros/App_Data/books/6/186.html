<br/>During the day the different articles were carried to Granite<br/>House, where they were methodically arranged in the great hall.<br/>This day—the 29th of October—happened to be a Sunday, and, before<br/>going to bed, Herbert asked the engineer if he would not read them<br/>something from the Gospel.<br/><br/>"Willingly," replied Cyrus Harding.<br/><br/>He took the sacred volume, and was about to open it, when<br/>Pencroft stopped him, saying,—"Captain, I am superstitious. Open at<br/>random and read the first verse which, your eye falls upon. We will<br/>see if it applies to our situation."<br/><br/>Cyrus Harding smiled at the sailor's idea, and, yielding to his<br/>wish, he opened exactly at a place where the leaves were separated<br/>by a marker.<br/><br/>Immediately his eyes were attracted by a cross which, made with<br/>a pencil, was placed against the eighth verse of the seventh<br/>chapter of the Gospel of St. Matthew. He read the verse, which was<br/>this:—<br/><br/>"For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh<br/>findeth."<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
