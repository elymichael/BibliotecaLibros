It had been agreed that the construction of the vessel should be<br/>actively pushed forward, and Cyrus Harding more than ever devoted<br/>his time and labor to this object. It was impossible to divine what<br/>future lay before them. Evidently the advantage to the colonists<br/>would be great of having at their disposal a substantial vessel,<br/>capable of keeping the sea even in heavy weather, and large enough<br/>to attempt, in case of need, a voyage of some duration. Even if,<br/>when their vessel should be completed, the colonists should not<br/>resolve to leave Lincoln Island as yet, in order to gain either one<br/>of the Polynesian Archipelagoes of the Pacific or the shores of New<br/>Zealand, they might at least, sooner or later, proceed to Tabor<br/>Island, to leave there the notice relating to Ayrton. This was a<br/>precaution rendered indispensable by the possibility of the Scotch<br/>yacht reappearing in those seas, and it was of the highest<br/>importance that nothing should be neglected on this point.<br/><br/>The works were then resumed. Cyrus Harding, Pencroft, and<br/>Ayrton, assisted by Neb, Gideon Spilett, and Herbert, except when<br/>unavoidably called off by other necessary occupations, worked<br/>without cessation. It was important that the new vessel should be<br/>ready in five months—that is to say, by the beginning of March—if<br/>they wished to visit Tabor Island before the equinoctial gales<br/>rendered the voyage impracticable. Therefore the carpenters lost<br/>not a moment. Moreover, it was unnecessary to manufacture rigging,<br/>that of the "Speedy" having been saved entire, so that the hull<br/>only of the vessel needed to be constructed.<br/><br/>The end of the year 1868 found them occupied by these important<br/>labors, to the exclusion of almost all others. At the expiration of<br/>two months and a half the ribs had been set up and the first planks<br/>adjusted. It was already evident that the plans made by Cyrus<br/>Harding were admirable, and that the vessel would behave well at<br/>sea.<br/><br/>Pencroft brought to the task a devouring energy, and would even<br/>grumble when one or the other abandoned the carpenter's axe for the<br/>gun of the hunter. It was nevertheless necessary to keep up the<br/>stores of Granite House, in view of the approaching winter. But<br/>this did not satisfy Pencroft. The brave, honest sailor was not<br/>content when the workmen were not at the dockyard. when this<br/>happened he grumbled vigorously, and, by way of venting his<br/>feelings, did the work of six men.<br/><br/>The weather was very unfavorable during the whole of the summer<br/>season. For some days the heat was overpowering, and the<br/>atmosphere, saturated with electricity, was only cleared by violent<br/>storms. It was rarely that the distant growling of the thunder<br/>could not be heard, like a low but incessant murmur, such as is<br/>produced in the equatorial regions of the globe.<br/><br/>The 1st of January, 1869, was signalized by a storm of extreme<br/>violence, and the thunder burst several times over the island.<br/>Large trees were struck by the electric fluid and shattered, and<br/>among others one of those gigantic nettle-trees which had shaded<br/>the poultry-yard at the southern extremity of the lake. Had this<br/>meteor any relation to the phenomena going on in the bowels of the<br/>earth? Was there any connection between the commotion of the<br/>atmosphere and that of the interior of the earth? Cyrus Harding was<br/>inclined to think that such was the case, for the development of<br/>these storms was attended by the renewal of volcanic symptoms.<br/><br/>It was on the 3rd of January that Herbert, having ascended at<br/>daybreak to the plateau of Prospect Heights to harness one of the<br/>onagers, perceived an enormous hat-shaped cloud rolling from the<br/>summit of the volcano.<br/><br/>Herbert immediately apprised the colonists, who at once joined<br/>him in watching the summit of Mount Franklin.<br/><br/>"Ah!" exclaimed Pencroft, "those are not vapors this time! It<br/>seems to me that the giant is not content with breathing; he must<br/>smoke!"<br/><br/>This figure of speech employed by the sailor exactly expressed<br/>the changes going on at the mouth of the volcano. Already for three<br/>months had the crater emitted vapors more or less dense, but which<br/>were as yet produced only by an internal ebullition of mineral<br/>substances. But now the vapors were replaced by a thick smoke,<br/>rising in the form of a grayish column, more than three hundred<br/>feet in width at its base, and which spread like an immense<br/>mushroom to a height of from seven to eight hundred feet above the<br/>summit of the mountain.<br/><br/>"The fire is in the chimney," observed Gideon Spilett.<br/>
