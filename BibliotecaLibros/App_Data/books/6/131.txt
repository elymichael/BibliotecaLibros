Cyrus Harding's project had succeeded, but, according to his
usual habit he showed no satisfaction; with closed lips and a fixed

The nitro-glycerine had indeed acted powerfully. The opening
which it had made was so large that the volume of water which
escaped through this new outlet was at least treble that which
before passed through the old one. The result was, that a short
time after the operation the level of the lake would be lowered two
feet, or more.

iron-tipped spears, string made of fibers, flint and steel; they
then returned to the plateau, Top accompanying them.

On the way the sailor could not help saying to the
engineer,—

"Don't you think, captain, that by means of that charming liquid
you have made, one could blow up the whole of our island?"
