"And now, what shall we do with our prize?" said Neb. "We can't<br/>drag it to Granite House!"<br/><br/>"Leave it here, since it cannot turn over," replied Herbert,<br/>"and we will come back with the cart to fetch it."<br/><br/>"That is the best plan."<br/><br/>However, for greater precaution, Herbert took the trouble, which<br/>Neb deemed superfluous, to wedge up the animal with great stones;<br/>after which the two hunters returned to Granite House, following<br/>the beach, which the tide had left uncovered. Herbert, wishing to<br/>surprise Pencroft, said nothing about the "superb specimen of a<br/>chelonian" which they had turned over on the sand; but, two hours<br/>later, he and Neb returned with the cart to the place where they<br/>had left it. The "superb specimen of a chelonian" was no longer<br/>there!<br/><br/>Neb and Herbert stared at each other first; then they stared<br/>about them. It was just at this spot that the turtle had been left.<br/>The lad even found the stones which he had used, and therefore he<br/>was certain of not being mistaken.<br/><br/>"Well!" said Neb, "these beasts can turn themselves over,<br/>then?''<br/><br/>"It appears so," replied Herbert, who could not understand it at<br/>all, and was gazing at the stones scattered on the sand.<br/><br/>"Well, Pencroft will be disgusted!"<br/><br/>"And Captain Harding will perhaps be very perplexed how to<br/>explain this disappearance," thought Herbert.<br/><br/>"Look here," said Neb, who wished to hide his ill-luck, "we<br/>won't speak about it."<br/><br/>"On the contrary, Neb, we must speak about it," replied<br/>Herbert.<br/>
