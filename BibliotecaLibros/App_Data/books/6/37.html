The sailor and the lad, creeping among the grass, arrived at the<br/>foot of a tree, whose lower branches were covered with little<br/>birds. The couroucous were waiting the passage of insects which<br/>served for their nourishment. Their feathery feet could be seen<br/>clasping the slender twigs which supported them.<br/><br/>The hunters then rose, and using their sticks like scythes, they<br/>mowed down whole rows of these couroucous, who never thought of<br/>flying away, and stupidly allowed themselves to be knocked off. A<br/>hundred were already heaped on the ground, before the others made<br/>up their minds to fly.<br/><br/>"Well," said Pencroft, "here is game, which is quite within the<br/>reach of hunters like us. We have only to put out our hands and<br/>take it!"<br/><br/>The sailor having strung the couroucous like larks on flexible<br/>twigs, they then continued their exploration. The stream here made<br/>a bend towards the south, but this detour was probably not<br/>prolonged for the river must have its source in the mountain, and<br/>be supplied by the melting of the snow which covered the sides of<br/>the central cone.<br/><br/>The particular object of their expedition was, as has been said,<br/>to procure the greatest possible quantity of game for the<br/>inhabitants of the Chimneys. It must be acknowledged that as yet<br/>this object had not been attained. So the sailor actively pursued<br/>his researches, though he exclaimed, when some animal which he had<br/>not even time to recognize fled into the long grass, "If only we<br/>had had the dog Top!" But Top had disappeared at the same time as<br/>his master, and had probably perished with him.<br/><br/>Towards three o'clock new flocks of birds were seen through<br/>certain trees, at whose aromatic berries they were pecking, those<br/>of the juniper- tree among others. Suddenly a loud trumpet call<br/>resounded through the forest. This strange and sonorous cry was<br/>produced by a game bird called grouse in the United States. They<br/>soon saw several couples, whose plumage was rich chestnut-brown<br/>mottled with dark brown, and tail of the same color. Herbert<br/>recognized the males by the two wing-like appendages raised on the<br/>neck. Pencroft determined to get hold of at least one of these<br/>gallinaceae, which were as large as a fowl, and whose flesh is<br/>better than that of a pullet. But it was difficult, for they would<br/>not allow themselves to be approached. After several fruitless<br/>attempts, which resulted in nothing but scaring the grouse, the<br/>sailor said to the lad,â€”<br/><br/>"Decidedly, since we can't kill them on the wing, we must try to<br/>take them with a line."<br/><br/>"Like a fish?" cried Herbert, much surprised at the<br/>proposal.<br/><br/>"Like a fish," replied the sailor quite seriously. Pencroft had<br/>found among the grass half a dozen grouse nests, each having three<br/>or four eggs. He took great care not to touch these nests, to which<br/>their proprietors would not fail to return. It was around these<br/>that he meant to stretch his lines, not snares, but real<br/>fishing-lines. He took Herbert to some distance from the nests, and<br/>there prepared his singular apparatus with all the care which a<br/>disciple of Izaak Walton would have used. Herbert watched the work<br/>with great interest, though rather doubting its success. The lines<br/>were made of fine creepers, fastened one to the other, of the<br/>length of fifteen or twenty feet. Thick, strong thorns, the points<br/>bent back (which were supplied from a dwarf acacia bush) were<br/>fastened to the ends of the creepers, by way of hooks. Large red<br/>worms, which were crawling on the ground, furnished bait.<br/><br/>This done, Pencroft, passing among the grass and concealing<br/>himself skillfully, placed the end of his lines armed with hooks<br/>near the grouse nests; then he returned, took the other ends and<br/>hid with Herbert behind a large tree. There they both waited<br/>patiently; though, it must be said, that Herbert did not reckon<br/>much on the success of the inventive Pencroft.<br/><br/>A whole half-hour passed, but then, as the sailor had surmised,<br/>several couple of grouse returned to their nests. They walked<br/>along, pecking the ground, and not suspecting in any way the<br/>presence of the hunters, who, besides, had taken care to place<br/>themselves to leeward of the gallinaceae.<br/>
