<br/>"Pencroft!" said Cyrus Harding.<br/><br/>Gideon Spilett had resumed his examination of the wounded boy.<br/>Herbert was still so frightfully pale, that the reporter felt<br/>anxious.<br/><br/>"Cyrus," said he, "I am not a surgeon. I am in terrible<br/>perplexity. You must aid me with your advice, your experience!"<br/><br/>"Take courage, my friend," answered the engineer, pressing the<br/>reporter's hand. "Judge coolly. Think only of this: Herbert must be<br/>saved!"<br/><br/>These words restored to Gideon Spilett that self-possession<br/>which he had lost in a moment of discouragement on feeling his<br/>great responsibility. He seated himself close to the bed. Cyrus<br/>Harding stood near. Pencroft had torn up his shirt, and was<br/>mechanically making lint.<br/><br/>Spilett then explained to Cyrus Harding that he thought he ought<br/>first of all to stop the hemorrhage, but not close the two wounds,<br/>or cause their immediate cicatrization, for there had been internal<br/>perforation, and the suppuration must not be allowed to accumulate<br/>in the chest.<br/><br/>Harding approved entirely, and it was decided that the two<br/>wounds should be dressed without attempting to close them by<br/>immediate coaptation.<br/><br/>And now did the colonists possess an efficacious agent to act<br/>against the inflammation which might occur?<br/><br/>Yes. They had one, for nature had generously lavished it. They<br/>had cold water, that is to say, the most powerful sedative that can<br/>be employed against inflammation of wounds, the most efficacious<br/>therapeutic agent in grave cases, and the one which is now adopted<br/>by all physicians. Cold water has, moreover, the advantage of<br/>leaving the wound in absolute rest, and preserving it from all<br/>premature dressing, a considerable advantage, since it has been<br/>found by experience that contact with the air is dangerous during<br/>the first days.<br/><br/>Gideon Spilett and Cyrus Harding reasoned thus with their simple<br/>good sense, and they acted as the best surgeon would have done.<br/>Compresses of linen were applied to poor Herbert's two wounds, and<br/>were kept constantly wet with cold water.<br/><br/>
