The stones rolled and sparkled like fiery balls when they
crossed through the gleams of light. Harding was first—Ayrton last.
On they went, step by step. Now they slid over the slippery rock;
then they struggled to their feet and scrambled on.

At last the wire touched the rocks on the beach. The colonists
had reached the bottom of the basalt cliff.

There appeared a narrow ridge, running horizontally and parallel
with the sea. The settlers followed the wire along it. They had not
gone a hundred paces when the ridge by a moderate incline sloped
down to the level of the sea.

The engineer seized the wire and found that it disappeared
beneath the waves.

His companions were stupefied.

A cry of disappointment, almost a cry of despair, escaped them!
Must they then plunge beneath the water and seek there for some
submarine cavern? In their excited state they would not have
hesitated to do it.

The engineer stopped them.

He led his companions to a hollow in the rocks, and there—

"We must wait," said he. "The tide is high. At low water the way
will be open."

"But what can make you think-" asked Pencroft.
