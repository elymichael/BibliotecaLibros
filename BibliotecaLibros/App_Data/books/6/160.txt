"Why?"

"Because that pleases me!"

"Are you very fond of pig then, Pencroft?"

"I am very fond of pig," replied the sailor, "particularly of
its feet, and if it had eight instead of four, I should like it
twice as much!"

As to the animals in question, they were peccaries belonging to
one of the four species which are included in the family, and they
were also of the species of Tajacu, recognizable by their deep
color and the absence of those long teeth with which the mouths of
their congeners are armed. These peccaries generally live in herds,
and it was probable that they abounded in the woody parts of the
island.

At any rate, they were eatable from head to foot, and Pencroft
did not ask more from them.

Towards the 15th of August, the state of the atmosphere was
suddenly moderated by the wind shifting to the northwest. The
temperature rose some degrees, and the accumulated vapor in the air
was not long in resolving into snow. All the island was covered
with a sheet of white, and showed itself to its inhabitants under a
new aspect. The snow fell abundantly for several days, and it soon
reached a thickness of two feet.

The wind also blew with great violence, and at the height of
Granite House the sea could be heard thundering against the reefs.
In some places, the wind, eddying round the corners, formed the
snow into tall whirling columns, resembling those waterspouts which
turn round on their base, and which vessels attack with a shot from
a gun. However, the storm, coming from the northwest, blew across
the island, and the position of Granite House preserved it from a
direct attack.

But in the midst of this snow-storm, as terrible as if it had
been produced in some polar country, neither Cyrus Harding nor his
companions could, notwithstanding their wish for it, venture forth,
and they remained shut up for five days, from the 20th to the 25th
of August. They could hear the tempest raging in Jacamar Wood,
which would surely suffer from it. Many of the trees would no doubt
be torn up by the roots, but Pencroft consoled himself by thinking
that he would not have the trouble of cutting them down.

"The wind is turning woodman, let it alone," he repeated.
