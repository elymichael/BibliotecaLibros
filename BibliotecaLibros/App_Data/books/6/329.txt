"It can only be explained in that way, my friends," replied
Harding quickly, "and I understand now how Ayrton was able to point
out exactly the situation of Tabor Island, since the events which
had preceded his being left on the island had made it known to
him."

"However," observed Pencroft, "if he was not yet a brute when he
wrote that document, and if he threw it into the sea seven or eight
years ago, how is it that the paper has not been injured by
damp?"

"That proves," answered Cyrus Harding, "that Ayrton was deprived
of intelligence at a more recent time than he thinks."

"Of course it must be so," replied Pencroft, "without that the
fact would be unaccountable."

"Unaccountable indeed," answered the engineer, who did not
appear desirous to prolong the conversation.

"But has Ayrton told the truth?" asked the sailor.

"Yes," replied the reporter. "The story which he has told is
true in every point. I remember quite well the account in the
newspapers of the yacht expedition undertaken by Lord Glenarvan,
and its result."

"Ayrton has told the truth," added Harding. "Do not doubt it,
Pencroft, for it was painful to him. People tell the truth when
they accuse themselves like that!"

The next day—the 21st of December—the colonists descended to the
beach, and having climbed the plateau they found nothing of Ayrton.
He had reached his house in the corral during the night and the
settlers judged it best not to agitate him by their presence. Time
would doubtless perform what sympathy had been unable to
accomplish.

Herbert, Pencroft, and Neb resumed their ordinary occupations.
On this day the same work brought Harding and the reporter to the
workshop at the Chimneys.

"Do you know, my dear Cyrus," said Gideon Spilett, "that the
explanation you gave yesterday on the subject of the bottle has not
satisfied me at all! How can it be supposed that the unfortunate
man was able to write that document and throw the bottle into the
sea without having the slightest recollection of it?"
