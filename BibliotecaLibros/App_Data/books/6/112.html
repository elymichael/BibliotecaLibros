<br/>These were the seals which were to be captured. It was<br/>necessary, however, first to allow them to land, for with their<br/>close, short hair, and their fusiform conformation, being excellent<br/>swimmers, it is difficult to catch them in the sea, while on land<br/>their short, webbed feet prevent their having more than a slow,<br/>waddling movement.<br/><br/>Pencroft knew the habits of these creatures, and he advised<br/>waiting till they were stretched on the sand, when the sun, before<br/>long, would send them to sleep. They must then manage to cut off<br/>their retreat and knock them on the head.<br/><br/>The hunters, having concealed themselves behind the rocks,<br/>waited silently.<br/><br/>An hour passed before the seals came to play on the sand. They<br/>could count half a dozen. Pencroft and Herbert then went round the<br/>point of the islet, so as to take them in the rear, and cut off<br/>their retreat. During this time Cyrus Harding, Spilett, and Neb,<br/>crawling behind the rocks, glided towards the future scene of<br/>combat.<br/><br/>All at once the tall figure of the sailor appeared. Pencroft<br/>shouted. The engineer and his two companions threw themselves<br/>between the sea and the seals. Two of the animals soon lay dead on<br/>the sand, but the rest regained the sea in safety.<br/><br/>"Here are the seals required, captain!" said the sailor,<br/>advancing towards the engineer.<br/><br/>"Capital," replied Harding. "We will make bellows of them!"<br/><br/>"Bellows!" cried Pencroft. "Well! these are lucky seals!"<br/><br/>It was, in fact, a blowing-machine, necessary for the treatment<br/>of the ore that the engineer wished to manufacture with the skins<br/>of the amphibious creatures. They were of a medium size, for their<br/>length did not exceed six feet. They resembled a dog about the<br/>head.<br/><br/>As it was useless to burden themselves with the weight of both<br/>the animals, Neb and Pencroft resolved to skin them on the spot,<br/>while Cyrus Harding and the reporter continued to explore the<br/>islet.<br/><br/>
