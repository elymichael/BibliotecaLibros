"The 'Duncan!'" murmured Ayrton. "Already?" This last word
escaped Ayrton's lips as if involuntarily, and his head drooped
upon his hands.

Did not twelve years' solitude on a desert island appear to him
a sufficient expiation? Did not the penitent yet feel himself
pardoned, either in his own eyes or in the eyes of others?

"No," said he, "no! it cannot be the 'Duncan'!"

"Look, Ayrton," then said the engineer, "for it is necessary
that we should know beforehand what to expect."

Ayrton took the glass and pointed it in the direction indicated.
During some minutes he examined the horizon without moving, without
uttering a word. Then,â€”

"It is indeed a vessel," said he, "but I do not think she is the
'Duncan.'"

"Why do you not think so?" asked Gideon Spilett.

"Because the 'Duncan' is a steam-yacht, and I cannot perceive
any trace of smoke either above or near that vessel."

"Perhaps she is simply sailing," observed Pencroft. "The wind is
favorable for the direction which she appears to be taking, and she
may be anxious to economize her coal, being so far from land."

"It is possible that you may be right, Mr. Pencroft," answered
Ayrton, "and that the vessel has extinguished her fires. We must
wait until she is nearer, and then we shall soon know what to
expect."
