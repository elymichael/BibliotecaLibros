"Yes."

"But you don't believe that he will make fire?"

"I shall believe it when the wood is blazing in the
fireplace."

"It will blaze, since my master has said so."

"We shall see!"

Meanwhile, the sun had not reached the highest point in its
course above the horizon. The exploration, therefore, continued,
and was usefully marked by a discovery which Herbert made of a tree
whose fruit was edible. This was the stone-pine, which produces an
excellent almond, very much esteemed in the temperate regions of
America and Europe. These almonds were in a perfect state of
maturity, and Herbert described them to his companions, who feasted
on them.

"Come," said Pencroft, "sea-weed by way of bread, raw mussels
for meat, and almonds for dessert, that's certainly a good dinner
for those who have not a single match in their pocket!"

We mustn't complain," said Herbert.

"I am not complaining, my boy," replied Pencroft, "only I
repeat, that meat is a little too much economized in this sort of
meal."

"Top has found something!" cried Neb, who ran towards a thicket,
in the midst of which the dog had disappeared, barking. With Top's
barking were mingled curious gruntings.

The sailor and Herbert had followed Neb. If there was game there
this was not the time to discuss how it was to be cooked, but
rather, how they were to get hold of it.
