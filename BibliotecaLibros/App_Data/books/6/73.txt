"Perhaps these beasts will not let us pass by willingly," said
Pencroft.

"Well," replied the reporter, who had already hunted the tiger
in India, and the lion in Africa, "we shall soon learn how
successfully to encounter them. But in the meantime we must be upon
our guard!"

They ascended but slowly.

The distance, increased by detours and obstacles which could not
be surmounted directly, was long. Sometimes, too, the ground
suddenly fell, and they found themselves on the edge of a deep
chasm which they had to go round. Thus, in retracing their steps so
as to find some practicable path, much time was employed and
fatigue undergone for nothing. At twelve o'clock, when the small
band of adventurers halted for breakfast at the foot of a large
group of firs, near a little stream which fell in cascades, they
found themselves still half way from the first plateau, which most
probably they would not reach till nightfall. From this point the
view of the sea was much extended, but on the right the high
promontory prevented their seeing whether there was land beyond it.
On the left, the sight extended several miles to the north; but, on
the northwest, at the point occupied by the explorers, it was cut
short by the ridge of a fantastically-shaped spur, which formed a
powerful support of the central cone.

At one o'clock the ascent was continued. They slanted more
towards the southwest and again entered among thick bushes. There
under the shade of the trees fluttered several couples of
gallinaceae belonging to the pheasant species. They were tragopans,
ornamented by a pendant skin which hangs over their throats, and by
two small, round horns, planted behind the eyes. Among these birds,
which were about the size of a fowl, the female was uniformly
brown, while the male was gorgeous in his red plumage, decorated
with white spots. Gideon Spilett, with a stone cleverly and
vigorously thrown, killed one of these tragopans, on which
Pencroft, made hungry by the fresh air, had cast greedy eyes.

After leaving the region of bushes, the party, assisted by
resting on each other's shoulders, climbed for about a hundred feet
up a steep acclivity and reached a level place, with very few
trees, where the soil appeared volcanic. It was necessary to ascend
by zigzags to make the slope more easy, for it was very steep, and
the footing being exceedingly precarious required the greatest
caution. Neb and Herbert took the lead, Pencroft the rear, the
captain and the reporter between them. The animals which frequented
these heights—and there were numerous traces of them— must
necessarily belong to those races of sure foot and supple spine,
chamois or goat. Several were seen, but this was not the name
Pencroft gave them, for all of a sudden—"Sheep!" he shouted.

All stopped about fifty feet from half-a-dozen animals of a
large size, with strong horns bent back and flattened towards the
point, with a woolly fleece, hidden under long silky hair of a
tawny color.

They were not ordinary sheep, but a species usually found in the
mountainous regions of the temperate zone, to which Herbert gave
the name of the musmon.

"Have they legs and chops?" asked the sailor.

"Yes," replied Herbert.

"Well, then, they are sheep!" said Pencroft.
