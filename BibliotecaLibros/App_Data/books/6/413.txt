"Into the corral, then!" said Pencroft.

"In a moment," said Harding.

And he ran round the left corner of the palisade. There he found
a convict, who aiming at him, sent a ball through his hat. In a few
seconds, before he had even time to fire his second barrel, he
fell, struck to the heart by Harding's dagger, more sure even than
his gun.

During this time, Gideon Spilett and the sailor hoisted
themselves over the palisade, leaped into the enclosure, threw down
the props which supported the inner door, ran into the empty house,
and soon, poor Herbert was lying on Ayrton's bed. In a few moments,
Harding was by his side.

On seeing Herbert senseless, the sailor's grief was
terrible.

He sobbed, he cried, he tried to beat his head against the
wall.

Neither the engineer nor the reporter could calm him. They
themselves were choked with emotion. They could not speak.

However, they knew that it depended on them to rescue from death
the poor boy who was suffering beneath their eyes. Gideon Spilett
had not passed through the many incidents by which his life had
been checkered without acquiring some slight knowledge of medicine.
He knew a little of everything, and several times he had been
obliged to attend to wounds produced either by a sword-bayonet or
shot. Assisted by Cyrus Harding, he proceeded to render the aid
Herbert required.

The reporter was immediately struck by the complete stupor in
which Herbert lay, a stupor owing either to the hemorrhage, or to
the shock, the ball having struck a bone with sufficient force to
produce a violent concussion.

Herbert was deadly pale, and his pulse so feeble that Spilett
only felt it beat at long intervals, as if it was on the point of
stopping.

These symptoms were very serious.
