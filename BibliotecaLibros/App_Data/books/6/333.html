The weather was splendid, the temperature very warm in the day<br/>time, but in the evening the sea-breezes tempered the heat of the<br/>atmosphere and procured cool nights for the inhabitants of Granite<br/>House. There were, however, a few storms, which, although they were<br/>not of long duration, swept over Lincoln Island with extraordinary<br/>fury. The lightning blazed and the thunder continued to roll for<br/>some hours.<br/><br/>At this period the little colony was extremely prosperous.<br/><br/>The tenants of the poultry-yard swarmed, and they lived on the<br/>surplus, but it became necessary to reduce the population to a more<br/>moderate number. The pigs had already produced young, and it may be<br/>understood that their care for these animals absorbed a great part<br/>of Neb and Pencroft's time. The onagers, who had two pretty colts,<br/>were most often mounted by Gideon Spilett and Herbert, who had<br/>become an excellent rider under the reporter's instruction, and<br/>they also harnessed them to the cart either for carrying wood and<br/>coal to Granite House, or different mineral productions required by<br/>the engineer.<br/><br/>Several expeditions were made about this time into the depths of<br/>the Far West Forests. The explorers could venture there without<br/>having anything to fear from the heat, for the sun's rays scarcely<br/>penetrated through the thick foliage spreading above their heads.<br/>They thus visited all the left bank of the Mercy, along which ran<br/>the road from the corral to the mouth of Falls River.<br/><br/>But in these excursions the settlers took care to be well armed,<br/>for they met with savage wild boars, with which they often had a<br/>tussle. They also, during this season, made fierce war against the<br/>jaguars. Gideon Spilett had vowed a special hatred against them,<br/>and his pupil Herbert seconded him well. Armed as they were, they<br/>no longer feared to meet one of those beasts. Herbert's courage was<br/>superb, and the reporter's sang-froid astonishing. Already twenty<br/>magnificent skins ornamented the dining-room of Granite House, and<br/>if this continued, the jaguar race would soon be extinct in the<br/>island, the object aimed at by the hunters.<br/><br/>The engineer sometimes took part in the expeditions made to the<br/>unknown parts of the island, which he surveyed with great<br/>attention. It was for other traces than those of animals that he<br/>searched the thickets of the vast forest, but nothing suspicious<br/>ever appeared. Neither Top nor Jup, who accompanied him, ever<br/>betrayed by their behavior that there was anything strange there,<br/>and yet more than once again the dog barked at the mouth of the<br/>well, which the engineer had before explored without result.<br/><br/>At this time Gideon Spilett, aided by Herbert, took several<br/>views of the most picturesque parts of the island, by means of the<br/>photographic apparatus found in the cases, and of which they had<br/>not as yet made any use.<br/><br/>This apparatus, provided with a powerful object-glass, was very<br/>complete. Substances necessary for the photographic reproduction,<br/>collodion for preparing the glass plate, nitrate of silver to<br/>render it sensitive, hyposulfate of soda to fix the prints<br/>obtained, chloride of ammonium in which to soak the paper destined<br/>to give the positive proof, acetate of soda and chloride of gold in<br/>which to immerse the paper, nothing was wanting. Even the papers<br/>were there, all prepared, and before laying in the printing-frame<br/>upon the negatives, it was sufficient to soak them for a few<br/>minutes in the solution of nitrate of silver.<br/><br/>The reporter and his assistant became in a short time very<br/>skilful operators, and they obtained fine views of the country,<br/>such as the island, taken from Prospect Heights with Mount Franklin<br/>in the distance, the mouth of the Mercy, so picturesquely framed in<br/>high rocks, the glade and the corral, with the spurs of the<br/>mountain in the background, the curious development of Claw Cape,<br/>Flotsam Point, etc.<br/><br/>Nor did the photographers forget to take the portraits of all<br/>the inhabitants of the island, leaving out no one.<br/><br/>"It multiplies us," said Pencroft.<br/>
