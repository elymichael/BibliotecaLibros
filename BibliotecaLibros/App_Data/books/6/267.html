<br/>"They shall not pass!" returned the engineer.<br/><br/>But if they did not pass it was not for want of having attempted<br/>it. Those in the rear pushed on the foremost assailants, and it was<br/>an incessant struggle with revolvers and hatchets. Several colpeos<br/>already lay dead on the ground, but their number did not appear to<br/>diminish, and it might have been supposed that reinforcements were<br/>continually arriving over the bridge.<br/><br/>The colonists were soon obliged to fight at close quarters, not<br/>without receiving some wounds, though happily very slight ones.<br/>Herbert had, with a shot from his revolver, rescued Neb, on whose<br/>back a colpeo had sprung like a tiger cat. Top fought with actual<br/>fury, flying at the throats of the foxes and strangling them<br/>instantaneously. Jup wielded his weapon valiantly, and it was in<br/>vain that they endeavored to keep him in the rear. Endowed<br/>doubtless with sight which enabled him to pierce the obscurity, he<br/>was always in the thick of the fight uttering from time to timeâ€”a<br/>sharp hissing sound, which was with him the sign of great<br/>rejoicing.<br/><br/>At one moment he advanced so far, that by the light from a<br/>revolver he was seen surrounded by five or six large colpeos, with<br/>whom he was coping with great coolness.<br/><br/>However, the struggle was ended at last, and victory was on the<br/>side of the settlers, but not until they had fought for two long<br/>hours! The first signs of the approach of day doubtless determined<br/>the retreat of their assailants, who scampered away towards the<br/>North, passing over the bridge, which Neb ran immediately to raise.<br/>When day had sufficiently lighted up the field of battle, the<br/>settlers counted as many as fifty dead bodies scattered about on<br/>the shore.<br/><br/>"And Jup!" cried Pencroft; "where is Jup?" Jup had disappeared.<br/>His friend Neb called him, and for the first time Jup did not reply<br/>to his friend's call.<br/><br/>Everyone set out in search of Jup, trembling lest he should be<br/>found among the slain; they cleared the place of the bodies which<br/>stained the snow with their blood. Jup was found in the midst of a<br/>heap of colpeos whose broken jaws and crushed bodies showed that<br/>they had to do with the terrible club of the intrepid animal.<br/><br/>Poor Jup still held in his hand the stump of his broken cudgel,<br/>but deprived of his weapon he had been overpowered by numbers, and<br/>his chest was covered with severe wounds.<br/><br/>"He is living," cried Neb, who was bending over him.<br/><br/>"And we will save him," replied the sailor. "We will nurse him<br/>as if he was one of ourselves."<br/><br/>
