"My own opinion," said Gideon Spilett, "with due deference to
your experience, Pencroft, is that in the double fact of the
absolute disappearance of Cyrus and Top, living or dead, there is
something unaccountable and unlikely."

"I wish I could think like you, Mr. Spilett," replied Pencroft;
"unhappily, my mind is made up on this point." Having said this,
the sailor returned to the Chimneys. A good fire crackled on the
hearth. Herbert had just thrown on an armful of dry wood, and the
flame cast a bright light into the darkest parts of the
passage.

Pencroft immediately began to prepare the dinner. It appeared
best to introduce something solid into the bill of fare, for all
needed to get up their strength. The strings of couroucous were
kept for the next day, but they plucked a couple of grouse, which
were soon spitted on a stick, and roasting before a blazing
fire.

At seven in the evening Neb had not returned. The prolonged
absence of the Negro made Pencroft very uneasy. It was to be feared
that he had met with an accident on this unknown land, or that the
unhappy fellow had been driven to some act of despair. But Herbert
drew very different conclusions from this absence. According to
him, Neb's delay was caused by some new circumstances which had
induced him to prolong his search. Also, everything new must be to
the advantage of Cyrus Harding. Why had Neb not returned unless
hope still detained him? Perhaps he had found some mark, a
footstep, a trace which had put him in the right path. Perhaps he
was at this moment on a certain track. Perhaps even he was near his
master.

Thus the lad reasoned. Thus he spoke. His companions let him
talk. The reporter alone approved with a gesture. But what Pencroft
thought most probable was, that Neb had pushed his researches on
the shore farther than the day before, and that he had not as yet
had time to return.

Herbert, however, agitated by vague presentiments, several times
manifested an intention to go to meet Neb. But Pencroft assured him
that that would be a useless course, that in the darkness and
deplorable weather he could not find any traces of Neb, and that it
would be much better to wait. If Neb had not made his appearance by
the next day, Pencroft would not hesitate to join him in his
search.

Gideon Spilett approved of the sailor's opinion that it was best
not to divide, and Herbert was obliged to give up his project; but
two large tears fell from his eyes.

The reporter could not refrain from embracing the generous
boy.

Bad weather now set in. A furious gale from the southeast passed
over the coast. The sea roared as it beat over the reef. Heavy rain
was dashed by the storm into particles like dust. Ragged masses of
vapor drove along the beach, on which the tormented shingles
sounded as if poured out in cart- loads, while the sand raised by
the wind added as it were mineral dust to that which was liquid,
and rendered the united attack insupportable. Between the river's
mouth and the end of the cliff, eddies of wind whirled and gusts
from this maelstrom lashed the water which ran through the narrow
valley. The smoke from the fireplace was also driven back through
the opening, filling the passages and rendering them
uninhabitable.

Therefore, as the grouse were cooked, Pencroft let the fire die
away, and only preserved a few embers buried under the ashes.
