Herbert did not reply. The loss of the box was certainly to be
regretted, but the boy was still sure of procuring fire in some way
or other. Pencroft, more experienced, did not think so, although he
was not a man to trouble himself about a small or great grievance.
At any rate, there was only one thing to be done—to await the
return of Neb and the reporter; but they must give up the feast of
hard eggs which they had meant to prepare, and a meal of raw flesh
was not an agreeable prospect either for themselves or for the
others.

Before returning to the cave, the sailor and Herbert, in the
event of fire being positively unattainable, collected some more
shell-fish, and then silently retraced their steps to their
dwelling.

Pencroft, his eyes fixed on the ground, still looked for his
box. He even climbed up the left bank of the river from its mouth
to the angle where the raft had been moored. He returned to the
plateau, went over it in every direction, searched among the high
grass on the border of the forest, all in vain.

It was five in the evening when he and Herbert re-entered the
cave. It is useless to say that the darkest corners of the passages
were ransacked before they were obliged to give it up in despair.
Towards six o'clock, when the sun was disappearing behind the high
lands of the west, Herbert, who was walking up and down on the
strand, signalized the return of Neb and Spilett.

They were returning alone!&#160;… . The boy's heart sank; the
sailor had not been deceived in his forebodings; the engineer,
Cyrus Harding, had not been found!

The reporter, on his arrival, sat down on a rock, without saying
anything. Exhausted with fatigue, dying of hunger, he had not
strength to utter a word.

As to Neb, his red eyes showed how he had cried, and the tears
which he could not restrain told too clearly that he had lost all
hope.

The reporter recounted all that they had done in their attempt
to recover Cyrus Harding. He and Neb had surveyed the coast for a
distance of eight miles and consequently much beyond the place
where the balloon had fallen the last time but one, a fall which
was followed by the disappearance of the engineer and the dog Top.
The shore was solitary; not a vestige of a mark. Not even a pebble
recently displaced; not a trace on the sand; not a human footstep
on all that part of the beach. It was clear that that portion of
the shore had never been visited by a human being. The sea was as
deserted as the land, and it was there, a few hundred feet from the
coast, that the engineer must have found a tomb.

As Spilett ended his account, Neb jumped up, exclaiming in a
voice which showed how hope struggled within him, "No! he is not
dead! he can't be dead! It might happen to any one else, but never
to him! He could get out of anything!" Then his strength forsaking
him, "Oh! I can do no more!" he murmured.

"Neb," said Herbert, running to him, "we will find him! God will
give him back to us! But in the meantime you are hungry, and you
must eat something."

So saying, he offered the poor Negro a few handfuls of
shell-fish, which was indeed wretched and insufficient food. Neb
had not eaten anything for several hours, but he refused them. He
could not, would not live without his master.
