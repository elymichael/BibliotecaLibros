<br/>For a long time alter this, Captain Nemo continued to live thus,<br/>traversing every sea. But one by one his companions died, and found<br/>their last resting-place in their cemetery of coral, in the bed of<br/>the Pacific. At last Captain Nemo remained the solitary survivor of<br/>all those who had taken refuge with him in the depths of the<br/>ocean.<br/><br/>He was now sixty years of age. Although alone, he succeeded in<br/>navigating the "Nautilus" towards one of those submarine caverns<br/>which had sometimes served him as a harbor.<br/><br/>One of these ports was hollowed beneath Lincoln Island, and at<br/>this moment furnished an asylum to the "Nautilus."<br/><br/>The captain had now remained there six years, navigating the<br/>ocean no longer, but awaiting death, and that moment when he should<br/>rejoin his former companions, when by chance he observed the<br/>descent of the balloon which carried the prisoners of the<br/>Confederates. Clad in his diving dress he was walking beneath the<br/>water at a few cables' length from the shore of the island, when<br/>the engineer had been thrown into the sea. Moved by a feeling of<br/>compassion the captain saved Cyrus Harding.<br/><br/>His first impulse was to fly from the vicinity of the five<br/>castaways; but his harbor refuge was closed, for in consequence of<br/>an elevation of the basalt, produced by the influence of volcanic<br/>action, he could no longer pass through the entrance of the vault.<br/>Though there was sufficient depth of water to allow a light craft<br/>to pass the bar, there was not enough for the "Nautilus," whose<br/>draught of water was considerable.<br/><br/>Captain Nemo was compelled, therefore, to remain. He observed<br/>these men thrown without resources upon a desert island, but had no<br/>wish to be himself discovered by them. By degrees he became<br/>interested in their efforts when he saw them honest, energetic, and<br/>bound to each other by the ties of friendship. As if despite his<br/>wishes, he penetrated all the secrets of their existence. By means<br/>of the diving dress he could easily reach the well in the interior<br/>of Granite House, and climbing by the projections of rock to its<br/>upper orifice he heard the colonists as they recounted the past,<br/>and studied the present and future. He learned from them the<br/>tremendous conflict of America with America itself, for the<br/>abolition of slavery. Yes, these men were worthy to reconcile<br/>Captain Nemo with that humanity which they represented so nobly in<br/>the island.<br/><br/>Captain Nemo had saved Cyrus Harding. It was he also who had<br/>brought back the dog to the Chimneys, who rescued Top from the<br/>waters of the lake, who caused to fall at Flotsam Point the case<br/>containing so many things useful to the colonists, who conveyed the<br/>canoe back into the stream of the Mercy, who cast the cord from the<br/>top of Granite House at the time of the attack by the baboons, who<br/>made known the presence of Ayrton upon Tabor Island, by means of<br/>the document enclosed in the bottle, who caused the explosion of<br/>the brig by the shock of a torpedo placed at the bottom of the<br/>canal, who saved Herbert from certain death by bringing the<br/>sulphate of quinine; and finally, it was he who had killed the<br/>convicts with the electric balls, of which he possessed the secret,<br/>and which he employed in the chase of submarine creatures. Thus<br/>were explained so many apparently supernatural occurrences, and<br/>which all proved the generosity and power of the captain.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, this noble misanthrope longed to benefit his<br/>proteges still further. There yet remained much useful advice to<br/>give them, and, his heart being softened by the approach of death,<br/>he invited, as we are aware, the colonists of Granite House to<br/>visit the "Nautilus," by means of a wire which connected it with<br/>the corral. Possibly he would not have done this had he been aware<br/>that Cyrus Harding was sufficiently acquainted with his history to<br/>address him by the name of Nemo.<br/><br/>The captain concluded the narrative of his life. Cyrus Harding<br/>then spoke; he recalled all the incidents which had exercised so<br/>beneficent an influence upon the colony, and in the names of his<br/>companions and himself thanked the generous being to whom they owed<br/>so much.<br/><br/>But Captain Nemo paid little attention; his mind appeared to be<br/>absorbed by one idea, and without taking the proffered hand of the<br/>engineer,â€”<br/><br/>
