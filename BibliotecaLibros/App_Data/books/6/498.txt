Day had returned. No ray of light penetrated into the profundity
of the cavern. It being high-water, the entrance was closed by the
sea. But the artificial light, which escaped in long streams from
the skylights of the "Nautilus" was as vivid as before, and the
sheet of water shone around the floating vessel.

An extreme exhaustion now overcame Captain Nemo, who had fallen
back upon the divan. It was useless to contemplate removing him to
Granite House, for he had expressed his wish to remain in the midst
of those marvels of the "Nautilus" which millions could not have
purchased, and to wait there for that death which was swiftly
approaching.

During a long interval of prostration, which rendered him almost
unconscious, Cyrus Harding and Gideon Spilett attentively observed
the condition of the dying man. It was apparent that his strength
was gradually diminishing. That frame, once so robust, was now but
the fragile tenement of a departing soul. All of life was
concentrated in the heart and head.

The engineer and reporter consulted in whispers. Was it possible
to render any aid to the dying man? Might his life, if not saved,
be prolonged for some days? He himself had said that no remedy
could avail, and he awaited with tranquillity that death which had
for him no terrors.

"We can do nothing," said Gideon Spilett.

"But of what is he dying?" asked Pencroft.
