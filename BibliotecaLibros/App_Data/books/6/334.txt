And the sailor was enchanted to see his own countenance,
faithfully reproduced, ornamenting the walls of Granite House, and
he stopped as willingly before this exhibition as he would have
done before the richest shop-windows in Broadway.

But it must be acknowledged that the most successful portrait
was incontestably that of Master Jup. Master Jup had sat with a
gravity not to be described, and his portrait was lifelike!

"He looks as if he was just going to grin!" exclaimed
Pencroft.

And if Master Jup had not been satisfied, he would have been
very difficult to please; but he was quite contented and
contemplated his own countenance with a sentimental air which
expressed some small amount of conceit.

The summer heat ended with the month of March. The weather was
sometimes rainy, but still warm. The month of March, which
corresponds to the September of northern latitudes, was not so fine
as might have been hoped. Perhaps it announced an early and
rigorous winter.

It might have been supposed one morning—the 21 st—that the first
snow had already made its appearance. In fact Herbert looking early
from one of the windows of Granite House, exclaimed,—

"Hallo! the islet is covered with snow!"

"Snow at this time?" answered the reporter, joining the boy.

Their companions were soon beside them, but could only ascertain
one thing, that not only the islet but all the beach below Granite
House was covered with one uniform sheet of white.

"It must be snow!" said Pencroft.
