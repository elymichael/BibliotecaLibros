All approached, and saw to their extreme surprise, a boat
floating down the current.

"Boat ahoy!" shouted the sailor, without thinking that perhaps
it would be best to keep silence.

No reply. The boat still drifted onward, and it was not more
than twelve feet off, when the sailor exclaimed,â€”

"But it is our own boat! she has broken her moorings, and
floated down the current. I must say she has arrived very
opportunely."

"Our boat?" murmured the engineer.

Pencroft was right. It was indeed the canoe, of which the rope
had undoubtedly broken, and which had come alone from the sources
of the Mercy. It was very important to seize it before the rapid
current should have swept it away out of the mouth of the river,
but Neb and Pencroft cleverly managed this by means of a long
pole.

The canoe touched the shore. The engineer leaped in first, and
found, on examining the rope, that it had been really worn through
by rubbing against the rocks.

"Well," said the reporter to him, in a low voice, "this is a
strange thing."

"Strange indeed!" returned Cyrus Harding.

Strange or not, it was very fortunate. Herbert, the reporter,
Neb, and Pencroft, embarked in turn. There was no doubt about the
rope having been worn through, but the astonishing part of the
affair was, that the boat should arrive just at the moment when the
settlers were there to seize it on its way, for a quarter of an
hour earlier or later it would have been lost in the sea.
