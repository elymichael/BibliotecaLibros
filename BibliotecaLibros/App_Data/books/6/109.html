The possible fault which he attributed to errors in the<br/>observation was, it may be seen, of five degrees on both sides,<br/>which, at sixty miles to a degree, would give an error of three<br/>hundred miles in latitude and longitude for the exact position.<br/><br/>But this error would not influence the determination which it<br/>was necessary to take. It was very evident that Lincoln Island was<br/>at such a distance from every country or island that it would be<br/>too hazardous to attempt to reach one in a frail boat.<br/><br/>In fact, this calculation placed it at least twelve hundred<br/>miles from Tahiti and the islands of the archipelago of the<br/>Pomoutous, more than eighteen hundred miles from New Zealand, and<br/>more than four thousand five hundred miles from the American<br/>coast!<br/><br/>And when Cyrus Harding consulted his memory, he could not<br/>remember in any way that such an island occupied, in that part of<br/>the Pacific, the situation assigned to Lincoln Island.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
