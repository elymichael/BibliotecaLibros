"And the more so that it is a full moon to-day," remarked
Herbert, "and these April tides are very strong."

"Well, Pencroft," asked Harding, "can you not anchor off the
Cape?"

"Anchor near land, with bad weather coming on!" exclaimed the
sailor. "What are you thinking of, captain? We should run aground,
of a certainty!"

"What will you do then?"

"I shall try to keep in the offing until the flood, that is to
say, till about seven in the evening, and if there is still light
enough I will try to enter the gulf; if not, we must stand off and
on during the night, and we will enter to-morrow at sunrise."

"As I told you, Pencroft, we will leave it to you," answered
Harding.

"Ah!" said Pencroft, "if there was only a lighthouse on the
coast, it would be much more convenient for sailors."

"Yes," replied Herbert, "and this time we shall have no obliging
engineer to light a fire to guide us into port!"

"Why, indeed, my dear Cyrus," said Spilett, "we have never
thanked you; but frankly, without that fire we should never have
been ableâ€”"

"A fire?" asked Harding, much astonished at the reporter's
words.

"We mean, captain," answered Pencroft, "that on board the
'Bonadventure' we were very anxious during the few hours before our
return, and we should have passed to windward of the island, if it
had not been for the precaution you took of lighting a fire the
night of the 19th of October, on Prospect Heights."
