<br/>"Well!" exclaimed Pencroft, "when that day comes, I do not know<br/>what more will be wanting in our island!"<br/><br/>These different plants, which had been carefully rooted up, were<br/>carried to the canoe, where Cyrus Harding had remained buried in<br/>thought.<br/><br/>The reporter, Herbert, and Pencroft in this manner frequently<br/>disembarked, sometimes on the right bank, sometimes on the left<br/>bank of the Mercy.<br/><br/>The latter was less abrupt, but the former more wooded. The<br/>engineer ascertained by consulting his pocket-compass that the<br/>direction of the river from the first turn was obviously southwest<br/>and northeast, and nearly straight for a length of about three<br/>miles. But it was to be supposed that this direction changed beyond<br/>that point, and that the Mercy continued to the north-west, towards<br/>the spurs of Mount Franklin, among which the river rose.<br/><br/>During one of these excursions, Gideon Spilett managed to get<br/>hold of two couples of living gallinaceae. They were birds with<br/>long, thin beaks, lengthened necks, short wings, and without any<br/>appearance of a tail. Herbert rightly gave them the name of<br/>tinamous, and it was resolved that they should be the first tenants<br/>of their future poultry-yard.<br/><br/>But till then the guns had not spoken, and the first report<br/>which awoke the echoes of the forest of the Far West was provoked<br/>by the appearance of a beautiful bird, resembling the<br/>kingfisher.<br/><br/>"I recognize him!" cried Pencroft, and it seemed as if his gun<br/>went off by itself.<br/><br/>"What do you recognize?" asked the reporter.<br/><br/>"The bird which escaped us on our first excursion, and from<br/>which we gave the name to that part of the forest."<br/><br/>"A jacamar!" cried Herbert.<br/><br/>
