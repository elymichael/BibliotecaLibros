<br/>"No," replied Pencroft, "for the sky was covered with thick<br/>clouds, and at any rate a star would not have been so low on the<br/>horizon. But Mr. Spilett saw it as well as we, and he will confirm<br/>our words."<br/><br/>"I will add," said the reporter, "that the fire was very bright,<br/>and that it shot up like a sheet of lightning."<br/><br/>"Yes, yes! exactly," added Herbert, "and it was certainly placed<br/>on the heights of Granite House."<br/><br/>"Well, my friends," replied Cyrus Harding, "during the night of<br/>the 19th of October, neither Neb nor I lighted any fire on the<br/>coast."<br/><br/>"You did not!" exclaimed Pencroft, in the height of his<br/>astonishment, not being able to finish his sentence.<br/><br/>"We did not leave Granite House," answered Cyrus Harding, "and<br/>if a fire appeared on the coast, it was lighted by another hand<br/>than ours!"<br/><br/>Pencroft, Herbert, and Neb were stupefied. No illusion could be<br/>possible, and a fire had actually met their eyes during the night<br/>of the 19th of October. Yes! they had to acknowledge it, a mystery<br/>existed! An inexplicable influence, evidently favorable to the<br/>colonists, but very irritating to their curiosity, was executed<br/>always in the nick of time on Lincoln Island. Could there be some<br/>being hidden in its profoundest recesses? It was necessary at any<br/>cost to ascertain this.<br/><br/>Harding also reminded his companions of the singular behavior of<br/>Top and Jup when they prowled round the mouth of the well, which<br/>placed Granite House in communication with the sea, and he told<br/>them that he had explored the well, without discovering anything<br/>suspicious. The final resolve taken, in consequence of this<br/>conversation, by all the members of the colony, was that as soon as<br/>the fine season returned they would thoroughly search the whole of<br/>the island.<br/><br/>But from that day Pencroft appeared to be anxious. He felt as if<br/>the island which he had made his own personal property belonged to<br/>him entirely no longer, and that he shared it with another master,<br/>to whom, willing or not, he felt subject. Neb and he often talked<br/>of those unaccountable things, and both, their natures inclining<br/>them to the marvelous, were not far from believing that Lincoln<br/>Island was under the dominion of some supernatural power.<br/><br/>In the meanwhile, the bad weather came with the month of May,<br/>the November of the northern zones. It appeared that the winter<br/>would be severe and forward. The preparations for the winter season<br/>were therefore commenced without delay.<br/><br/>
