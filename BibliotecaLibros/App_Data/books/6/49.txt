Gideon Spilett at last rose, after a long and attentive
examination.

"He lives!" said he.

Pencroft knelt in his turn beside the engineer, he also heard a
throbbing, and even felt a slight breath on his cheek.

Herbert at a word from the reporter ran out to look for water.
He found, a hundred feet off, a limpid stream, which seemed to have
been greatly increased by the rains, and which filtered through the
sand; but nothing in which to put the water, not even a shell among
the downs. The lad was obliged to content himself with dipping his
handkerchief in the stream, and with it hastened back to the
grotto.

Happily the wet handkerchief was enough for Gideon Spilett, who
only wished to wet the engineer's lips. The cold water produced an
almost immediate effect. His chest heaved and he seemed to try to
speak.

"We will save him!" exclaimed the reporter.

At these words hope revived in Neb's heart. He undressed his
master to see if he was wounded, but not so much as a bruise was to
be found, either on the head, body, or limbs, which was surprising,
as he must have been dashed against the rocks; even the hands were
uninjured, and it was difficult to explain how the engineer showed
no traces of the efforts which he must have made to get out of
reach of the breakers.

But the explanation would come later. When Cyrus was able to
speak he would say what had happened. For the present the question
was, how to recall him to life, and it appeared likely that rubbing
would bring this about; so they set to work with the sailor's
jersey.

The engineer, revived by this rude shampooing, moved his arm
slightly and began to breathe more regularly. He was sinking from
exhaustion, and certainly, had not the reporter and his companions
arrived, it would have been all over with Cyrus Harding.

"You thought your master was dead, didn't you?" said the seaman
to Neb.

"Yes! quite dead!" replied Neb, "and if Top had not found you,
and brought you here, I should have buried my master, and then have
lain down on his grave to die!"
