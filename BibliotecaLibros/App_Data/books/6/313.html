<br/>They set to work by choosing timber for the frame and machinery<br/>of the mill. Some large stones, found at the north of the lake,<br/>could be easily transformed into millstones, and as to the sails,<br/>the inexhaustible case of the balloon furnished the necessary<br/>material.<br/><br/>Cyrus Harding made his model, and the site of the mill was<br/>chosen a little to the right of the poultry-yard, near the shore of<br/>the lake. The frame was to rest on a pivot supported with strong<br/>timbers, so that it could turn with all the machinery it contained<br/>according as the wind required it. The work advanced rapidly. Neb<br/>and Pencroft had become very skilful carpenters, and had nothing to<br/>do but to copy the models provided by the engineer.<br/><br/>Soon a sort of cylindrical box, in shape like a pepper-pot, with<br/>a pointed roof, rose on the spot chosen. The four frames which<br/>formed the sails had been firmly fixed in the center beam, so as to<br/>form a certain angle with it, and secured with iron clamps. As to<br/>the different parts of the internal mechanism, the box destined to<br/>contain the two millstones, the fixed stone and the moving stone,<br/>the hopper, a sort of large square trough, wide at the top, narrow<br/>at the bottom, which would allow the grain to fall on the stones,<br/>the oscillating spout intended to regulate the passing of the<br/>grain, and lastly the bolting machine, which by the operation of<br/>sifting, separates the bran from the flour, were made without<br/>difficulty. The tools were good, and the work not difficult, for in<br/>reality, the machinery of a mill is very simple. This was only a<br/>question of time.<br/><br/>Every one had worked at the construction of the mill, and on the<br/>1st of December it was finished. As usual, Pencroft was delighted<br/>with his work, and had no doubt that the apparatus was perfect.<br/><br/>"Now for a good wind," said he, "and we shall grind our first<br/>harvest splendidly!"<br/><br/>"A good wind, certainly," answered the engineer, "but not too<br/>much, Pencroft."<br/><br/>"Pooh! our mill would only go the faster!"<br/><br/>"There is no need for it to go so very fast," replied Cyrus<br/>Harding. "It is known by experience that the greatest quantity of<br/>work is performed by a mill when the number of turns made by the<br/>sails in a minute is six times the number of feet traversed by the<br/>wind in a second. A moderate breeze, which passes over twenty-four<br/>feet to the second, will give sixteen turns to the sails during a<br/>minute, and there is no need of more."<br/><br/>"Exactly!" cried Herbert, "a fine breeze is blowing from the<br/>northeast, which will soon do our business for us."<br/><br/>There was no reason for delaying the inauguration of the mill,<br/>for the settlers were eager to taste the first piece of bread in<br/>Lincoln Island. On this morning two or three bushels of wheat were<br/>ground, and the next day at breakfast a magnificent loaf, a little<br/>heavy perhaps, although raised with yeast, appeared on the table at<br/>Granite House. Every one munched away at it with a pleasure which<br/>may be easily understood.<br/><br/>
