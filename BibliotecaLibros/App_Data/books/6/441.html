The next day, the 8th of December, was but a succession of the<br/>fainting fits. Herbert's thin hands clutched the sheets. They had<br/>administered further doses of pounded bark, but the reporter<br/>expected no result from it.<br/><br/>"If before tomorrow morning we have not given him a more<br/>energetic febrifuge," said the reporter, "Herbert will be<br/>dead."<br/><br/>Night arrivedâ€”the last night, it was too much to be feared, of<br/>the good, brave, intelligent boy, so far in advance of his years,<br/>and who was loved by all as their own child.
