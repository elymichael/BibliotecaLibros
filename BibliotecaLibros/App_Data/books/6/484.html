"He would not have called us if the means had been wanting to<br/>enable us to reach him!"<br/><br/>Cyrus Harding spoke in a tone of such thorough conviction that<br/>no objection was raised. His remark, besides, was logical. It was<br/>quite possible that an opening, practicable at low water, though<br/>hidden now by the high tide, opened at the foot of the cliff.<br/><br/>There was some time to wait. The colonists remained silently<br/>crouching in a deep hollow. Rain now began to fall in torrents. The<br/>thunder was re- echoed among the rocks with a grand<br/>sonorousness.<br/><br/>The colonists' emotion was great. A thousand strange and<br/>extraordinary ideas crossed their brains, and they expected some<br/>grand and superhuman apparition, which alone could come up to the<br/>notion they had formed of the mysterious genius of the island.<br/><br/>At midnight, Harding carrying the lantern, descended to the<br/>beach to reconnoiter.<br/><br/>The engineer was not mistaken. The beginning of an immense<br/>excavation could be seen under the water. There the wire, bending<br/>at a right angle, entered the yawning gulf.<br/><br/>Cyrus Harding returned to his companions, and said simply,â€”<br/><br/>"In an hour the opening will be practicable."<br/><br/>"It is there, then?" said Pencroft.<br/><br/>"Did you doubt it?" returned Harding.<br/><br/>"But this cavern must be filled with water to a certain height,"<br/>observed Herbert.<br/>
