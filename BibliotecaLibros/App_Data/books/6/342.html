I would rather a knife were run<br/>into my ribs than a sharp rock into those of my<br/>'Bonadventure!'"<br/><br/>That which Pencroft called ribs was the pan of his vessel under<br/>water, and he valued it more than his own skin.<br/><br/>"What o'clock is it?" asked Pencroft.<br/><br/>"Ten o'clock," replied Gideon Spilett.<br/><br/>"And what distance is it to the Cape, captain?"<br/><br/>"About fifteen miles," replied the engineer.<br/><br/>"That's a matter of two hours and a half," said the sailor, "and<br/>we shall be off the Cape between twelve and one o'clock. Unluckily,<br/>the tide will be turning at that moment, and will be ebbing out of<br/>the gulf. I am afraid that it will be very difficult to get in,<br/>having both wind and tide against us."<br/><br/>
