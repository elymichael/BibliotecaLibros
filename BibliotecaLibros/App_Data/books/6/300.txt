"No, captain," replied the sailor. "Half of the time she is
stranded on the sand, and that works her. She is a famous craft,
you see, and she behaved admirably during the squall which struck
us on our return."

"Could she not float in the river?"

"No doubt, captain, she could; but there is no shelter there,
and in the east winds, I think that the 'Bonadventure' would suffer
much from the surf."

"Well, where would you put her, Pencroft?"

"In Port Balloon," replied the sailor. "That little creek, shut
in by rocks, seems to me to be just the harbor we want."

"Is it not rather far?"

"Pooh! it is not more than three miles from Granite House, and
we have a fine straight road to take us there!"

"Do it then, Pencroft, and take your 'Bonadventure' there,"
replied the engineer, "and yet I would rather have her under our
more immediate protection. When we have time, we must make a little
harbor for her."

"Famous!" exclaimed Pencroft. "A harbor with a lighthouse, a
pier, and dock! Ah! really with you, captain, everything becomes
easy."

"Yes, my brave Pencroft," answered the engineer, "but on
condition, however, that you help me, for you do as much as three
men in all our work."

Herbert and the sailor then re-embarked on board the
"Bonadventure," the anchor was weighed, the sail hoisted, and the
wind drove her rapidly towards Claw Cape. Two hours after, she was
reposing on the tranquil waters of Port Balloon.
