<br/>"Here is the water, and yonder is the wood we require!" said<br/>Pencroft. "Well, Herbert, now we only want the house."<br/><br/>The water of the river was limpid. The sailor ascertained that<br/>at this time—that is to say, at low tide, when the rising floods<br/>did not reach it —it was sweet. This important point established,<br/>Herbert looked for some cavity which would serve them as a retreat,<br/>but in vain; everywhere the wall appeared smooth, plain, and<br/>perpendicular.<br/><br/>However, at the mouth of the watercourse and above the reach of<br/>the high tide, the convulsions of nature had formed, not a grotto,<br/>but a pile of enormous rocks, such as are often met with in granite<br/>countries and which bear the name of "Chimneys."<br/><br/>Pencroft and Herbert penetrated quite far in among the rocks, by<br/>sandy passages in which light was not wanting, for it entered<br/>through the openings which were left between the blocks, of which<br/>some were only sustained by a miracle of equilibrium; but with the<br/>light came also air—a regular corridor-gale—and with the wind the<br/>sharp cold from the exterior. However, the sailor thought that by<br/>stopping-up some of the openings with a mixture of stones and sand,<br/>the Chimneys could be rendered habitable. Their geometrical plan<br/>represented the typographical sign "&amp;," which signifies "et<br/>cetera" abridged, but by isolating the upper mouth of the sign,<br/>through which the south and west winds blew so strongly, they could<br/>succeed in making the lower part of use.<br/><br/>"Here's our work," said Pencroft, "and if we ever see Captain<br/>Harding again, he will know how to make something of this<br/>labyrinth."<br/><br/>"We shall see him again, Pencroft," cried Herbert, "and when be<br/>returns he must find a tolerable dwelling here. It will be so, if<br/>we can make a fireplace in the left passage and keep an opening for<br/>the smoke."<br/><br/>"So we can, my boy," replied the sailor, "and these Chimneys<br/>will serve our turn. Let us set to work, but first come and get a<br/>store of fuel. I think some branches will be very useful in<br/>stopping up these openings, through which the wind shrieks like so<br/>many fiends."<br/><br/>Herbert and Pencroft left the Chimneys, and, turning the angle,<br/>they began to climb the left bank of the river. The current here<br/>was quite rapid, and drifted down some dead wood. The rising<br/>tide—and it could already be perceived—must drive it back with<br/>force to a considerable distance. The sailor then thought that they<br/>could utilize this ebb and flow for the transport of heavy<br/>objects.<br/><br/>After having walked for a quarter of an hour, the sailor and the<br/>boy arrived at the angle which the river made in turning towards<br/>the left. From this point its course was pursued through a forest<br/>of magnificent trees. These trees still retained their verdure,<br/>notwithstanding the advanced season, for they belonged to the<br/>family of "coniferae," which is spread over all the regions of the<br/>globe, from northern climates to the tropics. The young naturalist<br/>recognized especially the "deedara," which are very numerous in the<br/>Himalayan zone, and which spread around them a most agreeable odor.<br/>Between these beautiful trees sprang up clusters of firs, whose<br/>opaque open parasol boughs spread wide around. Among the long<br/>grass, Pencroft felt that his feet were crushing dry branches which<br/>crackled like fireworks.<br/><br/>"Well, my boy," said he to Herbert, "if I don't know the name of<br/>these trees, at any rate I reckon that we may call them 'burning<br/>wood,' and just now that's the chief thing we want."<br/><br/>
