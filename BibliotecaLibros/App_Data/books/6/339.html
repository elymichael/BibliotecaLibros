"I hope that it is not so," replied Cyrus Harding, "and that<br/>Heaven has not deprived us of the best chance which remains to<br/>us."<br/><br/>"I think," observed the reporter, "that at any rate we shall<br/>know what we have to depend on when we have been to Tabor Island,<br/>for if the yacht has returned there, they will necessarily have<br/>left some traces of their visit."<br/><br/>"That is evident," answered the engineer. "So then, my friends,<br/>since we have this chance of returning to our country, we must wait<br/>patiently, and if it is taken from us we shall see what will be<br/>best to do."<br/><br/>"At any rate," remarked Pencroft, "it is well understood that if<br/>we do leave Lincoln Island, it will not be because we were<br/>uncomfortable there!"<br/><br/>"No, Pencroft," replied the engineer, "it will be because we are<br/>far from all that a man holds dearest in the world, his family, his<br/>friends, his native land!"<br/><br/>Matters being thus decided, the building of a vessel large<br/>enough to sail either to the Archipelagoes in the north, or to New<br/>Zealand in the west, was no longer talked of, and they busied<br/>themselves in their accustomed occupations, with a view to<br/>wintering a third time in Granite House.<br/><br/>However, it was agreed that before the stormy weather came on,<br/>their little vessel should be employed in making a voyage round the<br/>island. A complete survey of the coast had not yet been made, and<br/>the colonists had but an imperfect idea of the shore to the west<br/>and north, from the mouth of Falls River to the Mandible Capes, as<br/>well as of the narrow bay between them, which opened like a shark's<br/>jaws.<br/><br/>The plan of this excursion was proposed by Pencroft, and Cyrus<br/>Harding fully acquiesced in it, for he himself wished to see this<br/>part of his domain.<br/><br/>The weather was variable, but the barometer did not fluctuate by<br/>sudden movements, and they could therefore count on tolerable<br/>weather. However, during the first week of April, after a sudden<br/>barometrical fall, a renewed rise was marked by a heavy gale of<br/>wind, lasting five or six days; then the needle of the instrument<br/>remained stationary at a height of twenty-nine inches and<br/>nine-tenths, and the weather appeared propitious for an<br/>excursion.<br/><br/>The departure was fixed for the 16th of April, and the<br/>"Bonadventure," anchored in Port Balloon, was provisioned for a<br/>voyage which might be of some duration.<br/><br/>Cyrus Harding informed Ayrton of the projected expedition, and<br/>proposed that he should take part in it, but Ayrton preferring to<br/>remain on shore, it was decided that he should come to Granite<br/>House during the absence of his companions. Master Jup was ordered<br/>to keep him company, and made no remonstrance.<br/>
