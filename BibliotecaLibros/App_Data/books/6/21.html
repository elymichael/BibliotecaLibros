<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>4<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>All at once the reporter sprang up, and telling the sailor that<br/>he would rejoin them at that same place, he climbed the cliff in<br/>the direction which the Negro Neb had taken a few hours before.<br/>Anxiety hastened his steps, for he longed to obtain news of his<br/>friend, and he soon disappeared round an angle of the cliff.<br/>Herbert wished to accompany him.<br/><br/>"Stop here, my boy," said the sailor; "we have to prepare an<br/>encampment, and to try and find rather better grub than these<br/>shell-fish. Our friends will want something when they come back.<br/>There is work for everybody."<br/><br/>"I am ready," replied Herbert.<br/><br/>"All right," said the sailor; "that will do. We must set about<br/>it regularly. We are tired, cold, and hungry; therefore we must<br/>have shelter, fire, and food. There is wood in the forest, and eggs<br/>in nests; we have only to find a house."<br/><br/>"Very well," returned Herbert, "I will look for a cave among the<br/>rocks, and I shall be sure to discover some hole into which we can<br/>creep."<br/><br/>"All right," said Pencroft; "go on, my boy."<br/><br/>
