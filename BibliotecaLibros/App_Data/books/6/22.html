They both walked to the foot of the enormous wall over the<br/>beach, far from which the tide had now retreated; but instead of<br/>going towards the north, they went southward. Pencroft had<br/>remarked, several hundred feet from the place at which they landed,<br/>a narrow cutting, out of which he thought a river or stream might<br/>issue. Now, on the one hand it was important to settle themselves<br/>in the neighborhood of a good stream of water, and on the other it<br/>was possible that the current had thrown Cyrus Harding on the shore<br/>there.<br/><br/>The cliff, as has been said, rose to a height of three hundred<br/>feet, but the mass was unbroken throughout, and even at its base,<br/>scarcely washed by the sea, it did not offer the smallest fissure<br/>which would serve as a dwelling. It was a perpendicular wall of<br/>very hard granite, which even the waves had not worn away. Towards<br/>the summit fluttered myriads of sea-fowl, and especially those of<br/>the web-footed species with long, flat, pointed beaksâ€”a clamorous<br/>tribe, bold in the presence of man, who probably for the first time<br/>thus invaded their domains. Pencroft recognized the skua and other<br/>gulls among them, the voracious little sea-mew, which in great<br/>numbers nestled in the crevices of the granite. A shot fired among<br/>this swarm would have killed a great number, but to fire a shot a<br/>gun was needed, and neither Pencroft nor Herbert had one; besides<br/>this, gulls and sea-mews are scarcely eatable, and even their eggs<br/>have a detestable taste. However, Herbert, who had gone forward a<br/>little more to the left, soon came upon rocks covered with<br/>sea-weed, which, some hours later, would be hidden by the high<br/>tide. On these rocks, in the midst of slippery wrack, abounded<br/>bivalve shell-fish, not to be despised by starving people. Herbert<br/>called Pencroft, who ran up hastily.<br/><br/>"Here are mussels!" cried the sailor; "these will do instead of<br/>eggs!"<br/><br/>"They are not mussels," replied Herbert, who was attentively<br/>examining the molluscs attached to the rocks; "they are<br/>lithodomes."<br/><br/>"Are they good to eat?" asked Pencroft.<br/><br/>"Perfectly so."<br/><br/>"Then let us eat some lithodomes."<br/><br/>The sailor could rely upon Herbert; the young boy was well up in<br/>natural history, and always had had quite a passion for the<br/>science. His father had encouraged him in it, by letting him attend<br/>the lectures of the best professors in Boston, who were very fond<br/>of the intelligent, industrious lad. And his turn for natural<br/>history was, more than once in the course of time, of great use,<br/>and he was not mistaken in this instance. These lithodomes were<br/>oblong shells, suspended in clusters and adhering very tightly to<br/>the rocks. They belong to that species of molluscous perforators<br/>which excavate holes in the hardest stone; their shell is rounded<br/>at both ends, a feature which is not remarked in the common<br/>mussel.<br/><br/>Pencroft and Herbert made a good meal of the lithodomes, which<br/>were then half opened to the sun. They ate them as oysters, and as<br/>they had a strong peppery taste, they were palatable without<br/>condiments of any sort.<br/><br/>Their hunger was thus appeased for the time, but not their<br/>thirst, which increased after eating these naturally-spiced<br/>molluscs. They had then to find fresh water, and it was not likely<br/>that it would be wanting in such a capriciously uneven region.<br/>Pencroft and Herbert, after having taken the precaution of<br/>collecting an ample supply of lithodomes, with which they filled<br/>their pockets and handkerchiefs, regained the foot of the<br/>cliff.<br/><br/>Two hundred paces farther they arrived at the cutting, through<br/>which, as Pencroft had guessed, ran a stream of water, whether<br/>fresh or not was to be ascertained. At this place the wall appeared<br/>to have been separated by some violent subterranean force. At its<br/>base was hollowed out a little creek, the farthest part of which<br/>formed a tolerably sharp angle. The watercourse at that part<br/>measured one hundred feet in breadth, and its two banks on each<br/>side were scarcely twenty feet high. The river became strong almost<br/>directly between the two walls of granite, which began to sink<br/>above the mouth; it then suddenly turned and disappeared beneath a<br/>wood of stunted trees half a mile off.<br/>
