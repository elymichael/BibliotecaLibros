When Cyrus Harding and his companions recovered consciousness,
thanks to the attention lavished upon them, they found themselves
in the cabin of a steamer, without being able to comprehend how
they had escaped death.

A word from Ayrton explained everything.

"The 'Duncan'!" he murmured.

"The 'Duncan'!" exclaimed Cyrus Harding. And raising his hand to
Heaven, he said, "Oh! Almighty God! mercifully hast Thou preserved
us!"

It was, in fact, the "Duncan," Lord Glenarvan's yacht, now
commanded by Robert, son of Captain Grant, who had been despatched
to Tabor Island to find Ayrton, and bring him back to his native
land alter twelve years of expiation.

The colonists were not only saved, but already on the way to
their native country.

"Captain Grant," asked Cyrus Harding, "who can have suggested to
you the idea, after having left Tabor Island, where you did not
find Ayrton, of coming a hundred miles farther northeast?"

"Captain Harding," replied Robert Grant, "it was in order to
find, not only Ayrton, but yourself and your companions."

"My companions and myself?"

"Doubtless, at Lincoln Island."
