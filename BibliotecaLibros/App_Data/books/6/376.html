Gideon Spilett and Neb crouched among the rocks at the mouth of<br/>the Mercy, from which the drawbridges had been raised, so as to<br/>prevent any one from crossing in a boat or landing on the opposite<br/>shore.<br/><br/>As to Ayrton and Pencroft, they shoved off in the boat, and<br/>prepared to cross the channel and to take up two separate stations<br/>on the islet. In this way, shots being fired from four different<br/>points at once, the convicts would be led to believe that the<br/>island was both largely peopled and strongly defended.<br/><br/>In the event of a landing being effected without their having<br/>been able to prevent it, and also if they saw that they were on the<br/>point of being cut off by the brig's boat, Ayrton and Pencroft were<br/>to return in their boat to the shore and proceed towards the<br/>threatened spot.<br/><br/>Before starting to occupy their posts, the colonists for the<br/>last time wrung each other's hands.<br/><br/>Pencroft succeeded in controlling himself sufficiently to<br/>suppress his emotion when he embraced Herbert, his boy! and then<br/>they separated.<br/><br/>In a few moments Harding and Herbert on one side, the reporter<br/>and Neb on the other, had disappeared behind the rocks, and five<br/>minutes later Ayrton and Pencroft, having without difficulty<br/>crossed the channel, disembarked on the islet and concealed<br/>themselves in the clefts of its eastern shore.<br/><br/>None of them could have been seen, for they themselves could<br/>scarcely distinguish the brig in the fog.<br/><br/>It was half-past six in the morning.<br/><br/>Soon the fog began to clear away, and the topmasts of the brig<br/>issued from the vapor. For some minutes great masses rolled over<br/>the surface of the sea, then a breeze sprang up, which rapidly<br/>dispelled the mist.<br/><br/>The "Speedy" now appeared in full view, with a spring on her<br/>cable, her head to the north, presenting her larboard side to the<br/>island. Just as Harding had calculated, she was not more than a<br/>mile and a quarter from the coast.<br/><br/>The sinister black flag floated from the peak.<br/>
