<br/>During the first days passed by the stranger in Granite House,<br/>had he already given them reason to think that his savage nature<br/>was becoming tamed? Did a brighter light burn in the depths of that<br/>obscured mind? In short, was the soul returning to the body?<br/><br/>Yes, to a certainty, and to such a degree, that Cyrus Harding<br/>and the reporter wondered if the reason of the unfortunate man had<br/>ever been totally extinguished. At first, accustomed to the open<br/>air, to the unrestrained liberty which he had enjoyed on Tabor<br/>Island, the stranger manifested a sullen fury, and it was feared<br/>that he might throw himself onto the beach, out of one of the<br/>windows of Granite House. But gradually he became calmer, and more<br/>freedom was allowed to his movements.<br/><br/>They had reason to hope, and to hope much. Already, forgetting<br/>his carnivorous instincts, the stranger accepted a less bestial<br/>nourishment than that on which he fed on the islet, and cooked meat<br/>did not produce in him the same sentiment of repulsion which he had<br/>showed on board the "Bonadventure." Cyrus Harding had profited by a<br/>moment when he was sleeping, to cut his hair and matted beard,<br/>which formed a sort of mane and gave him such a savage aspect. He<br/>had also been clothed more suitably, after having got rid of the<br/>rag which covered him. The result was that, thanks to these<br/>attentions, the stranger resumed a more human appearance, and it<br/>even seemed as if his eyes had become milder. Certainly, when<br/>formerly lighted up by intelligence, this man's face must have had<br/>a sort of beauty.<br/><br/>Every day, Harding imposed on himself the task of passing some<br/>hours in his company. He came and worked near him, and occupied<br/>himself in different things, so as to fix his attention. A spark,<br/>indeed, would be sufficient to reillumine that soul, a recollection<br/>crossing that brain to recall reason. That had been seen, during<br/>the storm, on board the "Bonadventure!" The engineer did not<br/>neglect either to speak aloud, so as to penetrate at the same time<br/>by the organs of hearing and sight the depths of that torpid<br/>intelligence. Sometimes one of his companions, sometimes another,<br/>sometimes all joined him. They spoke most often of things belonging<br/>to the navy, which must interest a sailor.<br/><br/>At times, the stranger gave some slight attention to what was<br/>said, and the settlers were soon convinced that he partly<br/>understood them. Sometimes the expression of his countenance was<br/>deeply sorrowful, a proof that he suffered mentally, for his face<br/>could not be mistaken; but he did not speak, although at different<br/>times, however, they almost thought that words were about to issue<br/>from his lips. At all events, the poor creature was quite quiet and<br/>sad!<br/><br/>But was not his calm only apparent? Was not his sadness only the<br/>result of his seclusion? Nothing could yet be ascertained. Seeing<br/>only certain objects and in a limited space, always in contact with<br/>the colonists, to whom he would soon become accustomed, having no<br/>desires to satisfy, better fed, better clothed, it was natural that<br/>his physical nature should gradually improve; but was he penetrated<br/>with the sense of a new life? or rather, to employ a word which<br/>would be exactly applicable to him, was he not becoming tamed, like<br/>an animal in company with his master? This was an important<br/>question, which Cyrus Harding was anxious to answer, and yet he did<br/>not wish to treat his invalid roughly! Would he ever be a<br/>convalescent?<br/><br/>How the engineer observed him every moment! How he was on the<br/>watch for his soul, if one may use the expression! How he was ready<br/>to grasp it! The settlers followed with real sympathy all the<br/>phases of the cure undertaken by Harding. They aided him also in<br/>this work of humanity, and all, except perhaps the incredulous<br/>Pencroft, soon shared both his hope and his faith.<br/><br/>The calm of the stranger was deep, as has been said, and he even<br/>showed a sort of attachment for the engineer, whose influence he<br/>evidently felt. Cyrus Harding resolved then to try him, by<br/>transporting him to another scene, from that ocean which formerly<br/>his eyes had been accustomed to contemplate, to the border of the<br/>forest, which might perhaps recall those where so many years of his<br/>life had been passed!<br/><br/>"But," said Gideon Spilett, "can we hope that he will not<br/>escape, if once set at liberty?"<br/><br/>"The experiment must be tried," replied the engineer.<br/><br/>
