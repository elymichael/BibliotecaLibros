Indeed, it was to be feared that some serious accident had
occurred in the corral. No doubt, Ayrton might have sent a telegram
which had not arrived, but this was not the reason why his
companions were so uneasy, for, a more unaccountable circumstance,
Ayrton, who had promised to return the evening before, had not
reappeared. In short, it was not without a motive that all
communication had been stopped between the corral and Granite
House, and who but the convicts could have any interest in
interrupting this communication?

The settlers hastened on, their hearts oppressed with anxiety.
They were sincerely attached to their new companion. Were they to
find him struck down by the hands of those of whom he was formerly
the leader?

Soon they arrived at the place where the road led along the side
of the little stream which flowed from the Red Creek and watered
the meadows of the corral. They then moderated their pace so that
they should not be out of breath at the moment when a struggle
might be necessary. Their guns were in their hands ready cocked.
The forest was watched on every side. Top uttered sullen groans
which were rather ominous.

At last the palisade appeared through the trees. No trace of any
damage could be seen. The gate was shut as usual. Deep silence
reigned in the corral. Neither the accustomed bleating of the sheep
nor Ayrton's voice could be heard.

"Let us enter," said Cyrus Harding.

And the engineer advanced, while his companions, keeping watch
about twenty paces behind him, were ready to fire at a moment's
notice.

Harding raised the inner latch of the gate and was about to push
it back, when Top barked loudly. A report sounded and was responded
to by a cry of pain.

Herbert, struck by a bullet, lay stretched on the ground.
