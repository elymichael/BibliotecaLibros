<br/>While strolling along the shore about two miles from Granite<br/>House, Herbert and Neb were fortunate enough to capture a<br/>magnificent specimen of the order of chelonia. It was a turtle of<br/>the species Midas, the edible green turtle, so called from the<br/>color both of its shell and fat.<br/><br/>Herbert caught sight of this turtle as it was crawling among the<br/>rocks to reach the sea.<br/><br/>"Help, Neb, help!" he cried.<br/><br/>Neb ran up.<br/><br/>"What a fine animal!" said Neb; "but how are we to catch<br/>it?"<br/><br/>"Nothing is easier, Neb," replied Herbert. "We have only to turn<br/>the turtle on its back, and it cannot possibly get away. Take your<br/>spear and do as I do."<br/><br/>The reptile, aware of danger, had retired between its carapace<br/>and plastron. They no longer saw its head or feet, and it was<br/>motionless as a rock.<br/><br/>Herbert and Neb then drove their sticks underneath the animal,<br/>and by their united efforts managed without difficulty to turn it<br/>on its back. The turtle, which was three feet in length, would have<br/>weighed at least four hundred pounds.<br/><br/>"Capital!" cried Neb; "this is something which will rejoice<br/>friend Pencroft's heart."<br/><br/>In fact, the heart of friend Pencroft could not fail to be<br/>rejoiced, for the flesh of the turtle, which feeds on wrack-grass,<br/>is extremely savory. At this moment the creature's head could be<br/>seen, which was small, flat, but widened behind by the large<br/>temporal fossae hidden under the long roof.<br/><br/>
