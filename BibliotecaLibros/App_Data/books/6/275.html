<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>13<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>"A castaway!" exclaimed Pencroft; "left on this Tabor Island not<br/>two hundred miles from us! Ah, Captain Harding, you won't now<br/>oppose my going."<br/><br/>"No, Pencroft," replied Cyrus Harding; "and you shall set out as<br/>soon as possible."<br/><br/>"To-morrow?"<br/><br/>"To-morrow!"<br/><br/>The engineer still held in his hand the paper which he had taken<br/>from the bottle. He contemplated it for some instants, then<br/>resumed,<br/><br/>"From this document, my friends, from the way in which it is<br/>worded, we may conclude this: first, that the castaway on Tabor<br/>Island is a man possessing a considerable knowledge of navigation,<br/>since he gives the latitude and longitude of the island exactly as<br/>we ourselves found it, and to a second of approximation; secondly,<br/>that he is either English or American, as the document is written<br/>in the English language."<br/><br/>
