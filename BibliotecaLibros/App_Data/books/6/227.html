<br/>On the north, from this breach to the sea, by the new<br/>water-course which had hollowed out a bed for itself across the<br/>plateau and shore, above and below the fall, and it would be enough<br/>to dig the bed of this creek a little deeper to make it<br/>impracticable for animals, on all the eastern border by the sea<br/>itself, from the mouth of the aforesaid creek to the mouth of the<br/>Mercy.<br/><br/>Lastly, on the south, from the mouth to the turn of the Mercy<br/>where the bridge was to be established.<br/><br/>The western border of the plateau now remained between the turn<br/>of the river and the southern angle of the lake, a distance of<br/>about a mile, which was open to all comers. But nothing could be<br/>easier than to dig a broad deep ditch, which could be filled from<br/>the lake, and the overflow of which would throw itself by a rapid<br/>fall into the bed of the Mercy. The level of the lake would, no<br/>doubt, be somewhat lowered by this fresh discharge of its waters,<br/>but Cyrus Harding had ascertained that the volume of water in the<br/>Red Creek was considerable enough to allow of the execution of this<br/>project.<br/><br/>"So then," added the engineer, "Prospect Heights will become a<br/>regular island, being surrounded with water on all sides, and only<br/>communicating with the rest of our domain by the bridge which we<br/>are about to throw across the Mercy, the two little bridges already<br/>established above and below the fall; and, lastly, two other little<br/>bridges which must be constructed, one over the canal which I<br/>propose to dig, the other across to the left bank of the Mercy.<br/>Now, if these bridges can be raised at will, Prospect Heights will<br/>be guarded from any surprise."<br/><br/>The bridge was the most urgent work. Trees were selected, cut<br/>down, stripped of their branches, and cut into beams, joists, and<br/>planks. The end of the bridge which rested on the right bank of the<br/>Mercy was to be firm, but the other end on the left bank was to be<br/>movable, so that it might be raised by means of a counterpoise, as<br/>some canal bridges are managed.<br/><br/>This was certainly a considerable work, and though it was<br/>skillfully conducted, it took some time, for the Mercy at this<br/>place was eighty feet wide. It was therefore necessary to fix piles<br/>in the bed of the river so as to sustain the floor of the bridge<br/>and establish a pile-driver to act on the tops of these piles,<br/>which would thus form two arches and allow the bridge to support<br/>heavy loads.<br/><br/>Happily there was no want of tools with which to shape the wood,<br/>nor of iron-work to make it firm, nor of the ingenuity of a man who<br/>had a marvelous knowledge of the work, nor lastly, the zeal of his<br/>companions, who in seven months had necessarily acquired great<br/>skill in the use of their tools; and it must be said that not the<br/>least skilful was Gideon Spilett, who in dexterity almost equaled<br/>the sailor himself. "Who would ever have expected so much from a<br/>newspaper man!" thought Pencroft.<br/><br/>The construction of the Mercy bridge lasted three weeks of<br/>regular hard work. They even breakfasted on the scene of their<br/>labors, and the weather being magnificent, they only returned to<br/>Granite House to sleep.<br/><br/>During this period it may be stated that Master Jup grew more<br/>accustomed to his new masters, whose movements he always watched<br/>with very inquisitive eyes. However, as a precautionary measure,<br/>Pencroft did not as yet allow him complete liberty, rightly wishing<br/>to wait until the limits of the plateau should be settled by the<br/>projected works. Top and Jup were good friends and played willingly<br/>together, but Jup did everything solemnly.<br/><br/>On the 20th of November the bridge was finished. The movable<br/>part, balanced by the counterpoise, swung easily, and only a slight<br/>effort was needed to rise it; between its hinge and the last<br/>cross-bar on which it rested when closed, there existed a space of<br/>twenty feet, which was sufficiently wide to prevent any animals<br/>from crossing.<br/><br/>
