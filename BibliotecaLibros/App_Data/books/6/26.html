They then returned, following the southern crest of the granite<br/>platform, bordered by a long fringe of jagged rocks, of the most<br/>whimsical shapes. Some hundreds of birds lived there nestled in the<br/>holes of the stone; Herbert, jumping over the rocks, startled a<br/>whole flock of these winged creatures.<br/><br/>"Oh!" cried he, "those are not gulls nor sea-mews!"<br/><br/>"What are they then?" asked Pencroft.<br/><br/>"Upon my word, one would say they were pigeons!"<br/><br/>"Just so, but these are wild or rock pigeons. I recognize them<br/>by the double band of black on the wing, by the white tail, and by<br/>their slate- colored plumage. But if the rock-pigeon is good to<br/>eat, its eggs must be excellent, and we will soon see how many they<br/>may have left in their nests!"<br/><br/>"We will not give them time to hatch, unless it is in the shape<br/>of an omelet!" replied Pencroft merrily.<br/><br/>"But what will you make your omelet in?" asked Herbert; "in your<br/>hat?"<br/><br/>"Well!" replied the sailor, "I am not quite conjuror enough for<br/>that; we must come down to eggs in the shell, my boy, and I will<br/>undertake to despatch the hardest!"<br/><br/>Pencroft and Herbert attentively examined the cavities in the<br/>granite, and they really found eggs in some of the hollows. A few<br/>dozen being collected, were packed in the sailor's handkerchief,<br/>and as the time when the tide would be full was approaching,<br/>Pencroft and Herbert began to redescend towards the watercourse.<br/>When they arrived there, it was an hour after midday. The tide had<br/>already turned. They must now avail themselves of the ebb to take<br/>the wood to the mouth. Pencroft did not intend to let the raft go<br/>away in the current without guidance, neither did he mean to embark<br/>on it himself to steer it. But a sailor is never at a loss when<br/>there is a question of cables or ropes, and Pencroft rapidly<br/>twisted a cord, a few fathoms long, made of dry creepers. This<br/>vegetable cable was fastened to the after-part of the raft, and the<br/>sailor held it in his hand while Herbert, pushing off the raft with<br/>a long pole, kept it in the current. This succeeded capitally. The<br/>enormous load of wood drifted down the current. The bank was very<br/>equal; there was no fear that the raft would run aground, and<br/>before two o'clock they arrived at the river's mouth, a few paces<br/>from the Chimneys.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
