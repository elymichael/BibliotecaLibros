<br/>"This is my idea: philosophers generally admit that some day our<br/>globe will end, or rather that animal and vegetable life will no<br/>longer be possible, because of the intense cold to which it will be<br/>subjected. What they are not agreed upon, is the cause of this<br/>cold. Some think that it will arise from the falling of the<br/>temperature, which the sun will experience alter millions of years;<br/>others, from the gradual extinction of the fires in the interior of<br/>our globe, which have a greater influence on it than is generally<br/>supposed. I hold to this last hypothesis, grounding it on the fact<br/>that the moon is really a cold star, which is no longer habitable,<br/>although the sun continues to throw on its surface the same amount<br/>of heat. If, then, the moon has become cold, it is because the<br/>interior fires to which, as do all the stars of the stellar world,<br/>it owes its origin, are completely extinct. Lastly, whatever may be<br/>the cause, our globe will become cold some day, but this cold will<br/>only operate gradually. What will happen, then? The temperate<br/>zones, at a more or less distant period, will not be more habitable<br/>than the polar regions now are. Then the population of men, as well<br/>as the animals, will flow towards the latitudes which are more<br/>directly under the solar influence. An immense emigration will take<br/>place. Europe, Central Asia, North America, will gradually be<br/>abandoned, as well as Australasia and the lower parts of South<br/>America. The vegetation will follow the human emigration. The flora<br/>will retreat towards the Equator at the same time as the fauna. The<br/>central parts of South America and Africa will be the continents<br/>chiefly inhabited. The Laplanders and the Samoides will find the<br/>climate of the polar regions on the shores of the Mediterranean.<br/>Who can say, that at this period, the equatorial regions will not<br/>be too small, to contain and nourish terrestrial humanity? Now, may<br/>not provident nature, so as to give refuge to all the vegetable and<br/>animal emigration, be at present laying the foundation of a new<br/>continent under the Equator, and may she not have entrusted these<br/>insects with the construction of it? I have often thought of all<br/>these things, my friends, and I seriously believe that the aspect<br/>of our globe will some day be completely changed; that by the<br/>raising of new continents the sea will cover the old, and that, in<br/>future ages, a Columbus will go to discover the islands of<br/>Chimborazo, of the Himalayas, or of Mont Blanc, remains of a<br/>submerged America, Asia, and Europe. Then these new continents will<br/>become, in their turn, uninhabitable; heat will die away, as does<br/>the heat from a body when the soul has left it; and life will<br/>disappear from the globe, if not for ever, at least for a period.<br/>Perhaps then, our spheroid will rest— will be left to death—to<br/>revive some day under superior conditions! But all that, my<br/>friends, is the secret of the Author of all things; and beginning<br/>by the work of the insects, I have perhaps let myself be carried<br/>too far, in investigating the secrets of the future.<br/><br/>"My dear Cyrus," replied Spilett, "these theories are prophecies<br/>to me, and they will be accomplished some day."<br/><br/>"That is the secret of God," said the engineer.<br/><br/>"All that is well and good," then said Pencroft, who had<br/>listened with all his might, "but will you tell me, captain, if<br/>Lincoln Island has been made by your insects?"<br/><br/>"No," replied Harding; "it is of a purely volcanic origin."<br/><br/>"Then it will disappear some day?"<br/><br/>"That is probable.<br/><br/>"I hope we won't be here then."<br/><br/>"No, don't be uneasy, Pencroft; we shall not be here then, as we<br/>have no wish to die here, and hope to get away some time."<br/><br/>"In the meantime," replied Gideon Spilett, "let us establish<br/>ourselves here as if forever. There is no use in doing things by<br/>halves."<br/><br/>
