beast got away; as I tell you, we had turned it over on its
back!"

"Then you didn't turn it over enough!" returned the obstinate
sailor.

"Not enough!" cried Herbert.

stones.

"It is a miracle, then!" replied Pencroft.

"I thought, captain," said Herbert, "that turtles, once placed
on their backs, could not regain their feet, especially when they
are of a large size?'

"That is true, my boy," replied Cyrus Harding.
