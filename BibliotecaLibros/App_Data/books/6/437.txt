Neb did not hesitate. He wrote the note, he tied it to Jup's
neck, he brought the ape to the door of Granite House, from which
he let down a long cord to the ground; then, several times he
repeated these words,—

"Jup Jup! corral, corral!"

The creature understood, seized the cord, glided rapidly down
the beach, and disappeared in the darkness without the convicts'
attention having been in the least excited.

"You did well, Neb," said Harding, "but perhaps in not warning
us you would have done still better!"

And, in speaking thus, Cyrus Harding thought of Herbert, whose
recovery the removal had so seriously checked.

Neb ended his account. The convicts had not appeared at all on
the beach. Not knowing the number of the island's inhabitants, they
might suppose that Granite House was defended by a large party.
They must have remembered that during the attack by the brig
numerous shot had been fired both from the lower and upper rocks,
and no doubt they did not wish to expose themselves. But the
plateau of Prospect Heights was open to them, and not covered by
the fire of Granite House. They gave themselves up, therefore, to
their instinct of destruction,—plundering, burning, devastating
everything,—and only retiring half an hour before the arrival of
the colonists, whom they believed still confined in the corral.

On their retreat, Neb hurried out. He climbed the plateau at the
risk of being perceived and fired at, tried to extinguish the fire
which was consuming the buildings of the poultry-yard, and had
struggled, though in vain, against it until the cart appeared at
the edge of the wood.

Such had been these serious events. The presence of the convicts
constituted a permanent source of danger to the settlers in Lincoln
Island, until then so happy, and who might now expect still greater
misfortunes.

Spilett remained in Granite House with Herbert and Pencroft,
while Cyrus Harding, accompanied by Neb, proceeded to judge for
himself of the extent of the disaster.

It was fortunate that the convicts had not advanced to the foot
of Granite House. The workshop at the Chimneys would in that case
not have escaped destruction. But after all, this evil would have
been more easily reparable than the ruins accumulated on the
plateau of Prospect Heights. Harding and Neb proceeded towards the
Mercy, and ascended its left bank without meeting with any trace of
the convicts; nor on the other side of the river, in the depths of
the wood, could they perceive any suspicious indications.

Besides, it might be supposed that in all probability either the
convicts knew of the return of the settlers to Granite House, by
having seen them pass on the road from the corral, or, after the
devastation of the plateau, they had penetrated into Jacamar Wood,
following the course of the Mercy, and were thus ignorant of their
return.
