<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>15<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>The colonists, warned by the engineer, left their work and gazed<br/>in silence at the summit of Mount Franklin.<br/><br/>The volcano had awoke, and the vapor had penetrated the mineral<br/>layer heaped at the bottom of the crater. But would the<br/>subterranean fires provoke any violent eruption? This was an event<br/>which could not be foreseen. However, even while admitting the<br/>possibility of an eruption, it was not probable that the whole of<br/>Lincoln Island would suffer from it. The flow of volcanic matter is<br/>not always disastrous, and the island had already undergone this<br/>trial, as was shown by the streams of lava hardened on the northern<br/>slopes of the mountain. Besides, from the shape of the crater—the<br/>opening broken in the upper edge—the matter would be thrown to the<br/>side opposite the fertile regions of the island.<br/><br/>However, the past did not necessarily answer for the future.<br/>Often, at the summit of volcanoes, the old craters close and new<br/>ones open. This had occurred in the two hemispheres—at Etna,<br/>Popocatepetl, at Orizabaand on the eve of an eruption there is<br/>everything to be feared. In fact, an earthquake—a phenomenon which<br/>often accompanies volcanic eruption—is enough to change the<br/>interior arrangement of a mountain, and to open new outlets for the<br/>burning lava.<br/><br/>Cyrus Harding explained these things to his companions, and,<br/>without exaggerating the state of things, he told them all the pros<br/>and cons. After all, they could not prevent it. It did not appear<br/>likely that Granite House would be threatened unless the ground was<br/>shaken by an earthquake. But the corral would be in great danger<br/>should a new crater open in the southern side of Mount<br/>Franklin.<br/><br/>From that day the smoke never disappeared from the top of the<br/>mountain, and it could even be perceived that it increased in<br/>height and thickness, without any flame mingling in its heavy<br/>volumes. The phenomenon was still concentrated in the lower part of<br/>the central crater.<br/><br/>However, with the fine days work had been continued. The<br/>building of the vessel was hastened as much as possible, and, by<br/>means of the waterfall on the shore, Cyrus Harding managed to<br/>establish an hydraulic sawmill, which rapidly cut up the trunks of<br/>trees into planks and joists. The mechanism of this apparatus was<br/>as simple as those used in the rustic sawmills of Norway. A first<br/>horizontal movement to move the piece of wood, a second vertical<br/>movement to move the saw—this was all that was wanted; and the<br/>engineer succeeded by means of a wheel, two cylinders, and pulleys<br/>properly arranged. Towards the end of the month of September the<br/>skeleton of the vessel, which was to be rigged as a schooner, lay<br/>in the dockyard. The ribs were almost entirely completed, and, all<br/>the timbers having been sustained by a provisional band, the shape<br/>of the vessel could already be seen. The schooner, sharp in the<br/>bows, very slender in the after-part, would evidently be suitable<br/>for a long voyage, if wanted; but laying the planking would still<br/>take a considerable time. Very fortunately, the iron work of the<br/>pirate brig had been saved after the explosion. From the planks and<br/>injured ribs Pencroft and Ayrton had extracted the bolts and a<br/>large quantity of copper nails. It was so much work saved for the<br/>smiths, but the carpenters had much to do.<br/><br/>
