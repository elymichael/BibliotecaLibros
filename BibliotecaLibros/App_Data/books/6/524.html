<br/>Thus it happened that the wild animals, jaguars, wild boars,<br/>capybaras, koalas, and game of every kind, mad with terror, had<br/>fled to the banks of the Mercy and to the Tadorn Marsh, beyond the<br/>road to Port Balloon. But the colonists were too much occupied with<br/>their task to pay any attention to even the most formidable of<br/>these animals. They had abandoned Granite House, and would not even<br/>take shelter at the Chimneys, but encamped under a tent, near the<br/>mouth of the Mercy.<br/><br/>Each day Cyrus Harding and Gideon Spilett ascended the plateau<br/>of Prospect Heights. Sometimes Herbert accompanied them, but never<br/>Pencroft, who could not bear to look upon the prospect of the<br/>island now so utterly devastated.<br/><br/>It was, in truth, a heart-rending spectacle. All the wooded part<br/>of the island was now completely bare. One single clump of green<br/>trees raised their heads at the extremity of Serpentine Peninsula.<br/>Here and there were a few grotesque blackened and branchless<br/>stumps. The side of the devastated forest was even more barren than<br/>Tadorn Marsh. The eruption of lava had been complete. Where<br/>formerly sprang up that charming verdure, the soil was now nothing<br/>but a savage mass of volcanic tufa. In the valleys of the Falls and<br/>Mercy rivers no drop of water now flowed towards the sea, and<br/>should Lake Grant be entirely dried up, the colonists would have no<br/>means of quenching their thirst. But, fortunately the lava had<br/>spared the southern corner of the lake, containing all that<br/>remained of the drinking water of the island. Towards the northwest<br/>stood out the rugged and well-defined outlines of the sides of the<br/>volcano, like a gigantic claw hovering over the island. What a sad<br/>and fearful sight, and how painful to the colonists, who, from a<br/>fertile domain covered with forests, irrigated by watercourses, and<br/>enriched by the produce of their toils, found themselves, as it<br/>were, transported to a desolate rock, upon which, but for their<br/>reserves of provisions, they could not even gather the means of<br/>subsistence!<br/><br/>"It is enough to break one's heart!" said Gideon Spilett, one<br/>day.<br/><br/>"Yes, Spilett," answered the engineer. "May God grant us the<br/>time to complete this vessel, now our sole refuge!"<br/><br/>"Do not you think, Cyrus, that the violence of the eruption has<br/>somewhat lessened? The volcano still vomits forth lava, but<br/>somewhat less abundantly, if I mistake not."<br/><br/>"It matters little," answered Cyrus Harding. "The fire is still<br/>burning in the interior of the mountain, and the sea may break in<br/>at any moment. We are in the condition of passengers whose ship is<br/>devoured by a conflagration which they cannot extinguish, and who<br/>know that sooner or later the flames must reach the<br/>powder-magazine. To work, Spilett, to work, and let us not lose an<br/>hour!"<br/><br/>During eight days more, that is to say until the 7th of<br/>February, the lava continued to flow, but the eruption was confined<br/>within the previous limits. Cyrus Harding feared above all lest the<br/>liquefied matter should overflow the shore, for in that event the<br/>dockyard could not escape. Moreover, about this time the colonists<br/>felt in the frame of the island vibrations which alarmed them to<br/>the highest degree.<br/><br/>It was the 20th of February. Yet another month must elapse<br/>before the vessel would be ready for sea. Would the island hold<br/>together till then? The intention of Pencroft and Cyrus Harding was<br/>to launch the vessel as soon as the hull should be complete. The<br/>deck, the upperworks, the interior woodwork and the rigging might<br/>be finished afterwards, but the essential point was that the<br/>colonists should have an assured refuge away from the island.<br/>Perhaps it might be even better to conduct the vessel to Port<br/>Balloon, that is to say, as far as possible from the center of<br/>eruption, for at the mouth of the Mercy, between the islet and the<br/>wall of granite, it would run the risk of being crushed in the<br/>event of any convulsion. All the exertions of the voyagers were<br/>therefore concentrated upon the completion of the hull.<br/><br/>Thus the 3rd of March arrived, and they might calculate upon<br/>launching the vessel in ten days.<br/><br/>
