"Yes, captain. We will build a decked boat, and I will undertake
to steer her. At what distance are we from this Tabor Island?"

"About a hundred and fifty miles to the northeast," replied
Harding.

"A hundred and fifty miles! And what's that?" returned Pencroft.
"In forty-eight hours, with a good wind, we should sight it!"

And, on this reply, it was decided that a vessel should be
constructed in time to be launched towards the month of next
October, on the return of the fine season.
