"Are you quite sure of that, Pencroft?" asked the engineer,<br/>looking at the sailor.<br/><br/>"Of course we shall not be quite sure, till we have explored it<br/>in every direction," replied Pencroft.<br/><br/>"Yes," said Harding, "for we know only a small portion of it as<br/>yet. But at any rate, if we have no enemies in the interior, they<br/>may come from the exterior, for parts of the Pacific are very<br/>dangerous. We must be provided against every contingency."<br/><br/>Cyrus Harding spoke wisely; and without making any further<br/>objection, Pencroft prepared to execute his orders.<br/><br/>The front of Granite House was then to be lighted by five<br/>windows and a door, besides a large bay window and some smaller<br/>oval ones, which would admit plenty of light to enter into the<br/>marvelous nave which was to be their chief room. This facade,<br/>situated at a height of eighty feet above the ground, was exposed<br/>to the east, and the rising sun saluted it with its first rays. It<br/>was found to be just at that part of the cliff which was between<br/>the projection at the mouth of the Mercy and a perpendicular line<br/>traced above the heap of rocks which formed the Chimneys. Thus the<br/>winds from the northeast would only strike it obliquely, for it was<br/>protected by the projection. Besides, until the window-frames were<br/>made, the engineer meant to close the openings with thick shutters,<br/>which would prevent either wind or rain from entering, and which<br/>could be concealed in need.<br/><br/>The first work was to make the openings. This would have taken<br/>too long with the pickaxe alone, and it is known that Harding was<br/>an ingenious man. He had still a quantity of nitro-glycerine at his<br/>disposal, and he employed it usefully. By means of this explosive<br/>substance the rock was broken open at the very places chosen by the<br/>engineer. Then, with the pickaxe and spade, the windows and doors<br/>were properly shaped, the jagged edges were smoothed off, and a few<br/>days alter the beginning of the work, Granite House was abundantly<br/>lighted by the rising sun, whose rays penetrated into its most<br/>secret recesses. Following the plan proposed by Cyrus Harding, the<br/>space was to be divided into five compartments looking out on the<br/>sea; to the right, an entry with a door, which would meet the<br/>ladder; then a kitchen, thirty feet long; a dining-room, measuring<br/>forty feet; a sleeping- room, of equal size; and lastly, a<br/>"Visitor's room," petitioned for by Pencroft, and which was next to<br/>the great hall. These rooms, or rather this suite of rooms, would<br/>not occupy all the depth of the cave. There would be also a<br/>corridor and a storehouse, in which their tools, provisions, and<br/>stores would be kept. All the productions of the island, the flora<br/>as well as the fauna, were to be there in the best possible state<br/>of preservation, and completely sheltered from the damp. There was<br/>no want of space, so that each object could be methodically<br/>arranged. Besides, the colonists had still at their disposal the<br/>little grotto above the great cavern, which was like the garret of<br/>the new dwelling.<br/><br/>This plan settled, it had only to be put into execution. The<br/>miners became brickmakers again, then the bricks were brought to<br/>the foot of Granite House. Till then, Harding and his companions<br/>had only entered the cavern by the long passage. This mode of<br/>communication obliged them first to climb Prospect Heights, making<br/>a detour by the river's bank, and then to descend two hundred feet<br/>through the passage, having to climb as far when they wished to<br/>return to the plateau. This was a great loss of time, and was also<br/>very fatiguing. Cyrus Harding, therefore, resolved to proceed<br/>without any further delay to the fabrication of a strong rope<br/>ladder, which, once raised, would render Granite House completely<br/>inaccessible.<br/><br/>This ladder was manufactured with extreme care, and its<br/>uprights, formed of the twisted fibers of a species of cane, had<br/>the strength of a thick cable. As to the rounds, they were made of<br/>a sort of red cedar, with light, strong branches; and this<br/>apparatus was wrought by the masterly hand of Pencroft.<br/><br/>Other ropes were made with vegetable fibers, and a sort of crane<br/>with a tackle was fixed at the door. In this way bricks could<br/>easily be raised into Granite House. The transport of the materials<br/>being thus simplified, the arrangement of the interior could begin<br/>immediately. There was no want of lime, and some thousands of<br/>bricks were there ready to be used. The framework of the partitions<br/>was soon raised, very roughly at first, and in a short time, the<br/>cave was divided into rooms and storehouses, according to the plan<br/>agreed upon.<br/><br/>These different works progressed rapidly under the direction of<br/>the engineer, who himself handled the hammer and the trowel. No<br/>labor came amiss to Cyrus Harding, who thus set an example to his<br/>intelligent and zealous companions. They worked with confidence,<br/>even gaily, Pencroft always having some joke to crack, sometimes<br/>carpenter, sometimes rope- maker, sometimes mason, while he<br/>communicated his good humor to all the members of their little<br/>world. His faith in the engineer was complete; nothing could<br/>disturb it. He believed him capable of undertaking anything and<br/>succeeding in everything. The question of boots and<br/>clothes—assuredly a serious question,—that of light during the<br/>winter months, utilizing the fertile parts of the island,<br/>transforming the wild flora into cultivated flora, it all appeared<br/>easy to him; Cyrus Harding helping, everything would be done in<br/>time. He dreamed of canals facilitating the transport of the riches<br/>of the ground; workings of quarries and mines; machines for every<br/>industrial manufacture; railroads; yes, railroads! of which a<br/>network would certainly one day cover Lincoln Island.<br/><br/>The engineer let Pencroft talk. He did not put down the<br/>aspirations of this brave heart. He knew how communicable<br/>confidence is; he even smiled to hear him speak, and said nothing<br/>of the uneasiness for the future which he felt. In fact, in that<br/>part of the Pacific, out of the course of vessels, it was to be<br/>feared that no help would ever come to them. It was on themselves,<br/>on themselves alone, that the settlers must depend, for the<br/>distance of Lincoln Island from all other land was such, that to<br/>hazard themselves in a boat, of a necessarily inferior<br/>construction, would be a serious and perilous thing.<br/>
