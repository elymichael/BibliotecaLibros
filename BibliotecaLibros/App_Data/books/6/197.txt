"Still another minute!" said Pencroft.

"What's the matter?" asked the reporter.

"Though hunting is forbidden, fishing is allowed, I suppose,"
said the sailor.

"We have no time to lose," replied the engineer.

"Oh! five minutes!" replied Pencroft, "I only ask for five
minutes to use in the interest of our breakfast!"

And Pencroft, lying down on the bank, plunged his arm into the
water, and soon pulled up several dozen of fine crayfish from among
the stones.

"These will be good!" cried Neb, going to the sailor's aid.

"As I said, there is everything in this island, except tobacco!"
muttered Pencroft with a sigh.

The fishing did not take five minutes, for the crayfish were
swarming in the creek. A bag was filled with the crustaceae, whose
shells were of a cobalt blue. The settlers then pushed on.

They advanced more rapidly and easily along the bank of the
river than in the forest. From time to time they came upon the
traces of animals of a large size who had come to quench their
thirst at the stream, but none were actually seen, and it was
evidently not in this part of the forest that the peccary had
received the bullet which had cost Pencroft a grinder.
