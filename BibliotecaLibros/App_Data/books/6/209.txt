"Very well, since the opportunity is lost, let us go on; it
can't be helped," said Pencroft, who felt home-sickness for Granite
House.

But just as they were rising, Top was heard loudly barking; and
the dog issued from the wood, holding in his mouth a rag soiled
with mud.

Neb seized it. It was a piece of strong cloth!

Top still barked, and by his going and coming, seemed to invite
his master to follow him into the forest.

"Now there's something to explain the bullet!" exclaimed
Pencroft.

"A castaway!" replied Herbert.

"Wounded, perhaps!" said Neb.

"Or dead!" added the reporter.

All ran after the dog, among the tall pines on the border of the
forest. Harding and his companions made ready their firearms, in
case of an emergency.

They advanced some way into the wood, but to their great
disappointment, they as yet saw no signs of any human being having
passed that way. Shrubs and creepers were uninjured, and they had
even to cut them away with the axe, as they had done in the deepest
recesses of the forest. It was difficult to fancy that any human
creature had ever passed there, but yet Top went backward and
forward, not like a dog who searches at random, but like a dog
being endowed with a mind, who is following up an idea.
