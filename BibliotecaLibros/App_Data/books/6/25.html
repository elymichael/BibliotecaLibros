<br/>"Something tells me," cried Herbert, "that a man as energetic as<br/>Captain Harding would not let himself be drowned like other people.<br/>He must have reached some point of the shore; don't you think so,<br/>Pencroft?"<br/><br/>The sailor shook his head sadly. He little expected ever to see<br/>Cyrus Harding again; but wishing to leave some hope to Herbert:<br/>"Doubtless, doubtless," said he; "our engineer is a man who would<br/>get out of a scrape to which any one else would yield."<br/><br/>In the meantime he examined the coast with great attention.<br/>Stretched out below them was the sandy shore, bounded on the right<br/>of the river's mouth by lines of breakers. The rocks which were<br/>visible appeared like amphibious monsters reposing in the surf.<br/>Beyond the reef, the sea sparkled beneath the sun's rays. To the<br/>south a sharp point closed the horizon, and it could not be seen if<br/>the land was prolonged in that direction, or if it ran southeast<br/>and southwest, which would have made this coast a very long<br/>peninsula. At the northern extremity of the bay the outline of the<br/>shore was continued to a great distance in a wider curve. There the<br/>shore was low, flat, without cliffs, and with great banks of sand,<br/>which the tide left uncovered. Pencroft and Herbert then returned<br/>towards the west. Their attention was first arrested by the<br/>snow-topped mountain which rose at a distance of six or seven<br/>miles. From its first declivities to within two miles of the coast<br/>were spread vast masses of wood, relieved by large green patches,<br/>caused by the presence of evergreen trees. Then, from the edge of<br/>this forest to the shore extended a plain, scattered irregularly<br/>with groups of trees. Here and there on the left sparkled through<br/>glades the waters of the little river; they could trace its winding<br/>course back towards the spurs of the mountain, among which it<br/>seemed to spring. At the point where the sailor had left his raft<br/>of wood, it began to run between the two high granite walls; but if<br/>on the left bank the wall remained clear and abrupt, on the right<br/>bank, on the contrary, it sank gradually, the massive sides changed<br/>to isolated rocks, the rocks to stones, the stones to shingle<br/>running to the extremity of the point.<br/><br/>"Are we on an island?" murmured the sailor.<br/><br/>"At any rate, it seems to be big enough," replied the lad.<br/><br/>"An island, ever so big, is an island all the same!" said<br/>Pencroft.<br/><br/>But this important question could not yet be answered. A more<br/>perfect survey had to be made to settle the point. As to the land<br/>itself, island or continent, it appeared fertile, agreeable in its<br/>aspect, and varied in its productions.<br/><br/>"This is satisfactory," observed Pencroft; "and in our<br/>misfortune, we must thank Providence for it."<br/><br/>"God be praised!" responded Herbert, whose pious heart was full<br/>of gratitude to the Author of all things.<br/><br/>Pencroft and Herbert examined for some time the country on which<br/>they had been cast; but it was difficult to guess after so hasty an<br/>inspection what the future had in store for them.<br/><br/>
