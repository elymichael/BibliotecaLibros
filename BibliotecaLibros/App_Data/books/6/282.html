Doubtless some whaler had landed them on the island, where they<br/>had rapidly increased. Herbert resolved to catch one or two living,<br/>and take them back to Lincoln Island.<br/><br/>It was no longer doubtful that men at some period or other had<br/>visited this islet, and this became still more evident when paths<br/>appeared trodden through the forest, felled trees, and everywhere<br/>traces of the hand of man; but the trees were becoming rotten, and<br/>had been felled many years ago; the marks of the axe were velveted<br/>with moss, and the grass grew long and thick on the paths, so that<br/>it was difficult to find them.<br/><br/>"But," observed Gideon Spilett, "this not only proves that men<br/>have landed on the island, but also that they lived on it for some<br/>time. Now, who were these men? How many of them remain?"<br/><br/>"The document," said Herbert, "only spoke of one castaway."<br/><br/>"Well, if he is still on the island," replied Pencroft, "it is<br/>impossible but that we shall find him."<br/><br/>The exploration was continued. The sailor and his companions<br/>naturally followed the route which cut diagonally across the<br/>island, and they were thus obliged to follow the stream which<br/>flowed towards the sea.<br/><br/>If the animals of European origin, if works due to a human hand,<br/>showed incontestably that men had already visited the island,<br/>several specimens of the vegetable kingdom did not prove it less.<br/>In some places, in the midst of clearings, it was evident that the<br/>soil had been planted with culinary plants, at probably the same<br/>distant period.<br/><br/>What, then, was Herbert's joy, when he recognized potatoes,<br/>chicory, sorrel, carrots, cabbages, and turnips, of which it was<br/>sufficient to collect the seed to enrich the soil of Lincoln<br/>Island.<br/><br/>"Capital, jolly!" exclaimed Pencroft. "That will suit Neb as<br/>well as us. Even if we do not find the castaway, at least our<br/>voyage will not have been useless, and God will have rewarded<br/>us."<br/><br/>"Doubtless," replied Gideon Spilett, "but to see the state in<br/>which we find these plantations, it is to be feared that the island<br/>has not been inhabited for some time."<br/><br/>"Indeed," answered Herbert, "an inhabitant, whoever he was,<br/>could not have neglected such an important culture!"<br/>
