The convalescence of the young invalid was regularly
progressing. One thing only was now to be desired, that his state
would allow him to be brought to Granite House. However well built
and supplied the corral house was, it could not be so comfortable
as the healthy granite dwelling. Besides, it did not offer the same
security, and its tenants, notwithstanding their watchfulness, were
here always in fear of some shot from the convicts. There, on the
contrary, in the middle of that impregnable and inaccessible cliff,
they would have nothing to fear, and any attack on their persons
would certainly fail. They therefore waited impatiently for the
moment when Herbert might be moved without danger from his wound,
and they were determined to make this move, although the
communication through Jacamar Wood was very difficult.

They had no news from Neb, but were not uneasy on that account.
The courageous Negro, well entrenched in the depths of Granite
House, would not allow himself to be surprised. Top had not been
sent again to him, as it appeared useless to expose the faithful
dog to some shot which might deprive the settlers of their most
useful auxiliary.

They waited, therefore, although they were anxious to be
reunited at Granite House. It pained the engineer to see his forces
divided, for it gave great advantage to the pirates. Since Ayrton's
disappearance they were only four against five, for Herbert could
not yet be counted, and this was not the least care of the brave
boy, who well understood the trouble of which he was the cause.

The question of knowing how, in their condition, they were to
act against the pirates, was thoroughly discussed on the 29th of
November by Cyrus Harding, Gideon Spilett, and Pencroft, at a
moment when Herbert was asleep and could not hear them.

"My friends," said the reporter, after they had talked of Neb
and of the impossibility of communicating with him, "I think,â€”like
you, that to venture on the road to the corral would be to risk
receiving a gunshot without being able to return it. But do you not
think that the best thing to be done now is to openly give chase to
these wretches?"

"That is just what I was thinking," answered Pencroft. "I
believe we're not fellows to be afraid of a bullet, and as for me,
if Captain Harding approves, I'm ready to dash into the forest!
Why, hang it, one man is equal to another!"
