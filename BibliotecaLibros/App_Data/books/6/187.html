<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>3<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>The next day, the 30th of October, all was ready for the<br/>proposed exploring expedition, which recent events had rendered so<br/>necessary. In fact, things had so come about that the settlers in<br/>Lincoln Island no longer needed help for themselves, but were even<br/>able to carry it to others.<br/><br/>It was therefore agreed that they should ascend the Mercy as far<br/>as the river was navigable. A great part of the distance would thus<br/>be traversed without fatigue, and the explorers could transport<br/>their provisions and arms to an advanced point in the west of the<br/>island.<br/><br/>It was necessary to think not only of the things which they<br/>should take with them, but also of those which they might have by<br/>chance to bring back to Granite House. If there had been a wreck on<br/>the coast, as was supposed, there would be many things cast up,<br/>which would be lawfully their prizes. In the event of this, the<br/>cart would have been of more use than the light canoe, but it was<br/>heavy and clumsy to drag, and therefore more difficult to use; this<br/>led Pencroft to express his regret that the chest had not<br/>contained, besides "his halfpound of tobacco," a pair of strong New<br/>Jersey horses, which would have been very useful to the colony!<br/><br/>The provisions, which Neb had already packed up, consisted of a<br/>store of meat and of several gallons of beer, that is to say enough<br/>to sustain them for three days, the time which Harding assigned for<br/>the expedition. They hoped besides to supply themselves on the<br/>road, and Neb took care not to forget the portable stove.<br/><br/>The only tools the settlers took were the two woodmen's axes,<br/>which they could use to cut a path through the thick forests, as<br/>also the instruments, the telescope and pocket-compass.<br/><br/>For weapons they selected the two flint-lock guns, which were<br/>likely to be more useful to them than the percussion<br/>fowling-pieces, the first only requiring flints which could be<br/>easily replaced, and the latter needing fulminating caps, a<br/>frequent use of which would soon exhaust their limited stock.<br/>However, they took also one of the carbines and some cartridges. As<br/>to the powder, of which there was about fifty pounds in the barrel,<br/>a small supply of it had to be taken, but the engineer hoped to<br/>manufacture an explosive substance which would allow them to<br/>husband it. To the firearms were added the five cutlasses well<br/>sheathed in leather, and, thus supplied, the settlers could venture<br/>into the vast forest with some chance of success.<br/><br/>
