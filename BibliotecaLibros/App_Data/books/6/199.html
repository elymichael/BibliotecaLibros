<br/>There was, however, nothing to show that a shipwreck had taken<br/>place recently. It is true that, as Gideon Spilett observed, any<br/>remains of it might have drifted out to sea, and they must not take<br/>it for granted that because they could find no traces of it, a ship<br/>had not been castaway on the coast.<br/><br/>The reporter's argument was just, and besides, the incident of<br/>the bullet proved that a shot must have been fired in Lincoln<br/>Island within three months.<br/><br/>It was already five o'clock, and there were still two miles<br/>between the settlers and the extremity of the Serpentine Peninsula.<br/>It was evident that after having reached Reptile End, Harding and<br/>his companions would not have time to return before dark to their<br/>encampment near the source of the Mercy. It would therefore be<br/>necessary to pass the night on the promontory. But they had no lack<br/>of provisions, which was lucky, for there were no animals on the<br/>shore, though birds, on the contrary, abound—jacamars, couroucous,<br/>tragopans, grouse, lories, parrots, cockatoos, pheasants, pigeons,<br/>and a hundred others. There was not a tree without a nest, and not<br/>a nest which was not full of flapping wings.<br/><br/>Towards seven o'clock the weary explorers arrived at Reptile<br/>End. Here the seaside forest ended, and the shore resumed the<br/>customary appearance of a coast, with rocks, reefs, and sands. It<br/>was possible that something might be found here, but darkness came<br/>on, and the further exploration had to be put off to the next<br/>day.<br/><br/>Pencroft and Herbert hastened on to find a suitable place for<br/>their camp. Among the last trees of the forest of the Far West, the<br/>boy found several thick clumps of bamboos.<br/><br/>"Good," said he; "this is a valuable discovery."<br/><br/>"Valuable?" returned Pencroft.<br/><br/>"Certainly," replied Herbert. "I may say, Pencroft, that the<br/>bark of the bamboo, cut into flexible laths, is used for making<br/>baskets; that this bark, mashed into a paste, is used for the<br/>manufacture of Chinese paper; that the stalks furnish, according to<br/>their size, canes and pipes and are used for conducting water; that<br/>large bamboos make excellent material for building, being light and<br/>strong, and being never attacked by insects. I will add that by<br/>sawing the bamboo in two at the joint, keeping for the bottom the<br/>part of the transverse film which forms the joint, useful cups are<br/>obtained, which are much in use among the Chinese. No! you don't<br/>care for that. But—"<br/><br/>"But what?"<br/><br/>"But I can tell you, if you are ignorant of it, that in India<br/>these bamboos are eaten like asparagus."<br/><br/>
