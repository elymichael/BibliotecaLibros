The possible fault which he attributed to errors in the
observation was, it may be seen, of five degrees on both sides,
which, at sixty miles to a degree, would give an error of three
hundred miles in latitude and longitude for the exact position.

But this error would not influence the determination which it
was necessary to take. It was very evident that Lincoln Island was
at such a distance from every country or island that it would be
too hazardous to attempt to reach one in a frail boat.

In fact, this calculation placed it at least twelve hundred
miles from Tahiti and the islands of the archipelago of the
Pomoutous, more than eighteen hundred miles from New Zealand, and
more than four thousand five hundred miles from the American
coast!

And when Cyrus Harding consulted his memory, he could not
remember in any way that such an island occupied, in that part of
the Pacific, the situation assigned to Lincoln Island.
