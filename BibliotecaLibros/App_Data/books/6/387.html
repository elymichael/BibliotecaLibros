<br/>Several bodies floated also. Among them, Ayrton recognized that<br/>of Bob Harvey, which he pointed out to his companion, saying with<br/>some emotion,â€”<br/><br/>"That is what I have been, Pencroft."<br/><br/>"But what you are no longer, brave Ayrton!" returned the sailor<br/>warmly.<br/><br/>It was singular enough that so few bodies floated. Only five or<br/>six were counted, which were already being carried by the current<br/>towards the open sea. Very probably the convicts had not had time<br/>to escape, and the ship lying over on her side, the greater number<br/>of them had remained below. Now the current, by carrying the bodies<br/>of these miserable men out to sea, would spare the colonists the<br/>sad task of burying them in some corner of their island.<br/><br/>For two hours, Cyrus Harding and his companions were solely<br/>occupied in hauling up the spars on to the sand, and then in<br/>spreading the sails which were perfectly uninjured, to dry. They<br/>spoke little, for they were absorbed in their work, but what<br/>thoughts occupied their minds!<br/><br/>The possession of this brig, or rather all that she contained,<br/>was a perfect mine of wealth. In fact, a ship is like a little<br/>world in miniature, and the stores of the colony would be increased<br/>by a large number of useful articles. It would be, on a large<br/>scale, equivalent to the chest found at Flotsam Point.<br/><br/>"And besides," thought Pencroft, "why should it be impossible to<br/>refloat the brig? If she has only a leak, that may be stopped up; a<br/>vessel from three to four hundred tons, why she is a regular ship<br/>compared to our 'Bonadventure'! And we could go a long distance in<br/>her! We could go anywhere we liked! Captain Harding, Ayrton and I<br/>must examine her! She would be well worth the trouble!"<br/><br/>In fact, if the brig was still fit to navigate, the colonists'<br/>chances of returning to their native land were singularly<br/>increased. But, to decide this important question, it was necessary<br/>to wait until the tide was quite low, so that every part of the<br/>brig's hull might be examined.<br/><br/>When their treasures had been safely conveyed on shore, Harding<br/>and his companions agreed to devote some minutes to breakfast. They<br/>were almost famished; fortunately, the larder was not far off, and<br/>Neb was noted for being an expeditious cook. They breakfasted,<br/>therefore, near the Chimneys, and during their repast, as may be<br/>supposed, nothing was talked of but the event which had so<br/>miraculously saved the colony.<br/><br/>"Miraculous is the word," repeated Pencroft, "for it must be<br/>acknowledged that those rascals blew up just at the right moment!<br/>Granite House was beginning to be uncomfortable as a<br/>habitation!"<br/><br/>
