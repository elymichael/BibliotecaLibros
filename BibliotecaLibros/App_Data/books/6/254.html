<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>11<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>Winter arrived with the month of June, which is the December of<br/>the northern zones, and the great business was the making of warm<br/>and solid clothing.<br/><br/>The musmons in the corral had been stripped of their wool, and<br/>this precious textile material was now to be transformed into<br/>stuff.<br/><br/>Of course Cyrus Harding, having at his disposal neither carders,<br/>combers, polishers, stretchers, twisters, mule-jenny, nor<br/>self-acting machine to spin the wool, nor loom to weave it, was<br/>obliged to proceed in a simpler way, so as to do without spinning<br/>and weaving. And indeed he proposed to make use of the property<br/>which the filaments of wool possess when subjected to a powerful<br/>pressure of mixing together, and of manufacturing by this simple<br/>process the material called felt. This felt could then be obtained<br/>by a simple operation which, if it diminished the flexibility of<br/>the stuff, increased its power of retaining heat in proportion. Now<br/>the wool furnished by the musmons was composed of very short hairs,<br/>and was in a good condition to be felted.<br/><br/>The engineer, aided by his companions, including Pencroft, who<br/>was once more obliged to leave his boat, commenced the preliminary<br/>operations, the subject of which was to rid the wool of that fat<br/>and oily substance with which it is impregnated, and which is<br/>called grease. This cleaning was done in vats filled with water,<br/>which was maintained at the temperature of seventy degrees, and in<br/>which the wool was soaked for four-and-twenty hours; it was then<br/>thoroughly washed in baths of soda, and, when sufficiently dried by<br/>pressure, it was in a state to be compressed, that is to say, to<br/>produce a solid material, rough, no doubt, and such as would have<br/>no value in a manufacturing center of Europe or America, but which<br/>would be highly esteemed in the Lincoln Island markets.<br/><br/>This sort of material must have been known from the most ancient<br/>times, and, in fact, the first woolen stuffs were manufactured by<br/>the process which Harding was now about to employ. Where Harding's<br/>engineering qualifications now came into play was in the<br/>construction of the machine for pressing the wool; for he knew how<br/>to turn ingeniously to profit the mechanical force, hitherto<br/>unused, which the waterfall on the beach possessed to move a<br/>fulling-mill.<br/><br/>Nothing could be more rudimentary. The wool was placed in<br/>troughs, and upon it fell in turns heavy wooden mallets; such was<br/>the machine in question, and such it had been for centuries until<br/>the time when the mallets were replaced by cylinders of<br/>compression, and the material was no longer subjected to beating,<br/>but to regular rolling.<br/><br/>
