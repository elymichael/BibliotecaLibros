<br/>"Alone?"<br/><br/>"Yes!"<br/><br/>"But they will come back!" cried Ayrton. "Defend yourselves!<br/>defend yourselves!"<br/><br/>And he fell back exhausted.<br/><br/>"Spilett," exclaimed the engineer, "we may be attacked at any<br/>moment. Bring the cart into the corral. Then, barricade the door,<br/>and all come back here."<br/><br/>Pencroft, Neb, and the reporter hastened to execute the<br/>engineer's orders. There was not a moment to be lost. Perhaps even<br/>now the cart was in the hands of the convicts!<br/><br/>In a moment the reporter and his two companions had crossed the<br/>corral and reached the gate of the palisade behind which Top was<br/>heard growling sullenly.<br/><br/>The engineer, leaving Ayrton for an instant, came out ready to<br/>fire.

A<br/>black mass soon appeared. This was the cart entering the circle of<br/>light, and Cyrus Harding could hear the noise made by the door, as<br/>his companions shut it and fastened the interior bars.<br/><br/>But, at that moment, Top, breaking loose, began to bark<br/>furiously and rush to the back of the corral, to the right of the<br/>house.<br/><br/>
