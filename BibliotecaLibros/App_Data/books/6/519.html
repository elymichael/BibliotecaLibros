"Captain Nemo!" exclaimed the colonists.<br/><br/>"Yes, and it was the last service he desired to render us before<br/>his death!"<br/><br/>"The last service!" exclaimed Pencroft, "the last service! You<br/>will see that though he is dead he will render us others yet!"<br/><br/>"But what did the captain say?" inquired the reporter.<br/><br/>"I will tell you, my friends," said the engineer. "Lincoln<br/>Island does not resemble the other islands of the Pacific, and a<br/>fact of which Captain Nemo has made me cognizant must sooner or<br/>later bring about the subversion of its foundation."<br/><br/>"Nonsense! Lincoln Island, it can't be!" cried Pencroft, who, in<br/>spite of the respect he felt for Cyrus Harding, could not prevent a<br/>gesture of incredulity.<br/><br/>"Listen, Pencroft," resumed the engineer, "I will tell you what<br/>Captain Nemo communicated to me, and which I myself confirmed<br/>yesterday, during the exploration of Dakkar Grotto.<br/><br/>"This cavern stretches under the island as far as the volcano,<br/>and is only separated from its central shaft by the wall which<br/>terminates it. Now, this wall is seamed with fissures and clefts<br/>which already allow the sulphurous gases generated in the interior<br/>of the volcano to escape."<br/><br/>"Well?" said Pencroft, his brow suddenly contracting.<br/><br/>"Well, then, I saw that these fissures widen under the internal<br/>pressure from within, that the wall of basalt is gradually giving<br/>way and that after a longer or shorter period it will afford a<br/>passage to the waters of the lake which fill the cavern."<br/><br/>"Good!" replied Pencroft, with an attempt at pleasantry. "The<br/>sea will extinguish the volcano, and there will be an end of the<br/>matter!"<br/>
