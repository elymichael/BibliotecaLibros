"At what place, Cyrus?"

"At the part of the bank nearest the coast."

"But it is a mass of granite!" observed Spilett.

"Well," replied Cyrus Harding, "I will blow up the granite, and
the water escaping, will subside, so as to lay bare this
opening—"

"And make a waterfall, by falling on to the beach," added the
reporter.

"A fall that we shall make use of!" replied Cyrus. "Come,
come!"

The engineer hurried away his companion, whose confidence in
Harding was such that he did not doubt the enterprise would
succeed. And yet, how was this granite wall to be opened without
powder, and with imperfect instruments? Was not this work upon
which the engineer was so bent above their strength?

When Harding and the reporter entered the Chimneys, they found
Herbert and Pencroft unloading their raft of wood.

"The woodmen have just finished, captain." said the sailor,
laughing, "and when you want masons—"

"Masons,—no, but chemists," replied the engineer.
