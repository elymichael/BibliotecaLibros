According to the sailor, any animal, whatever it was, would be a<br/>lawful prize, and the rodents or carnivora which might get into the<br/>new snares would be well received at Granite House.<br/><br/>The traps were besides extremely simple; being pits dug in the<br/>ground, a platform of branches and grass above, which concealed the<br/>opening, and at the bottom some bait, the scent of which would<br/>attract animals. It must be mentioned also, that they had not been<br/>dug at random, but at certain places where numerous footprints<br/>showed that quadrupeds frequented the ground. They were visited<br/>every day, and at three different times, during the first days,<br/>specimens of those Antarctic foxes which they had already seen on<br/>the right bank of the Mercy were found in them.<br/><br/>"Why, there are nothing but foxes in this country!" cried<br/>Pencroft, when for the third time he drew one of the animals out of<br/>the pit. Looking at it in great disgust, he added, "beasts which<br/>are good for nothing!"<br/><br/>"Yes," said Gideon Spilett, "they are good for something!"<br/><br/>"And what is that?"<br/><br/>"To make bait to attract other creatures!"<br/><br/>The reporter was right, and the traps were henceforward baited<br/>with the foxes carcasses.<br/><br/>The sailor had also made snares from the long tough fibers of a<br/>certain plant, and they were even more successful than the traps.<br/>Rarely a day passed without some rabbits from the warren being<br/>caught. It was always rabbit, but Neb knew how to vary his sauces<br/>and the settlers did not think of complaining.<br/><br/>However, once or twice in the second week of August, the traps<br/>supplied the hunters with other animals more useful than foxes,<br/>namely, several of those small wild boars which had already been<br/>seen to the north of the lake. Pencroft had no need to ask if these<br/>beasts were eatable. He could see that by their resemblance to the<br/>pig of America and Europe.<br/><br/>"But these are not pigs," said Herbert to him, "I warn you of<br/>that, Pencroft."<br/><br/>"My boy," replied the sailor, bending over the trap and drawing<br/>out one of these representatives of the family of sus by the little<br/>appendage which served it as a tail. "Let me believe that these are<br/>pigs."<br/>
