About Verne:

Jules Gabriel Verne (February 8, 1828â€“March 24, 1905) was a
French author who pioneered the science-fiction genre. He is best
known for novels such as Journey To The Center Of The Earth (1864),
Twenty Thousand Leagues Under The Sea (1870), and Around the World
in Eighty Days (1873). Verne wrote about space, air, and underwater
travel before air travel and practical submarines were invented,
and before practical means of space travel had been devised. He is
the third most translated author in the world, according to Index
Translationum. Some of his books have been made into films. Verne,
along with Hugo Gernsback and H. G. Wells, is often popularly
referred to as the "Father of Science Fiction". Source:
