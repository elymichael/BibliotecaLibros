<br/>At any rate, the settlers saw at once, with extreme<br/>satisfaction, that the brig possessed a very varied cargo—an<br/>assortment of all sorts of articles, utensils, manufactured goods,<br/>and tools—such as the ships which make the great coasting-trade of<br/>Polynesia are usually laden with. It was probable that they would<br/>find a little of everything, and they agreed that it was exactly<br/>what was necessary for the colony of Lincoln Island.<br/><br/>However—and Cyrus Harding observed it in silent astonishment—not<br/>only, as has been said, had the hull of the brig enormously<br/>suffered from the shock, whatever it was, that had occasioned the<br/>catastrophe, but the interior arrangements had been destroyed,<br/>especially towards the bows. Partitions and stanchions were<br/>smashed, as if some tremendous shell had burst in the interior of<br/>the brig. The colonists could easily go fore and aft, after having<br/>removed the cases as they were extricated. They were not heavy<br/>bales, which would have been difficult to remove, but simple<br/>packages, of which the stowage, besides, was no longer<br/>recognizable.<br/><br/>The colonists then reached the stern of the brig—the part<br/>formerly surmounted by the poop. It was there that, following<br/>Ayrton's directions, they must look for the powder-magazine. Cyrus<br/>Harding thought that it had not exploded; that it was possible some<br/>barrels might be saved, and that the powder, which is usually<br/>enclosed in metal coverings might not have suffered from contact<br/>with the water.<br/><br/>This, in fact, was just what had happened. They extricated from<br/>among a large number of shot twenty barrels, the insides of which<br/>were lined with copper. Pencroft was convinced by the evidence of<br/>his own eyes that the destruction of the "Speedy" could not be<br/>attributed to an explosion. That part of the hull in which the<br/>magazine was situated was, moreover, that which had suffered<br/>least.<br/><br/>"It may be so," said the obstinate sailor; "but as to a rock,<br/>there is not one in the channel!"<br/><br/>"Then, how did it happen?" asked Herbert.<br/><br/>"I don't know," answered Pencroft, "Captain Harding doesn't<br/>know, and nobody knows or ever will know!"<br/><br/>Several hours had passed during these researches, and the tide<br/>began to flow. Work must be suspended for the present. There was no<br/>fear of the brig being carried away by the sea, for she was already<br/>fixed as firmly as if moored by her anchors.<br/><br/>They could, therefore, without inconvenience, wait until the<br/>next day to resume operations; but, as to the vessel itself, she<br/>was doomed, and it would be best to hasten to save the remains of<br/>her hull, as she would not be long in disappearing in the<br/>quicksands of the channel.<br/><br/>It was now five o'clock in the evening. It had been a hard day's<br/>work for the men. They ate with good appetite, and notwithstanding<br/>their fatigue, they could not resist, after dinner, their desire of<br/>inspecting the cases which composed the cargo of the "Speedy."<br/><br/>
