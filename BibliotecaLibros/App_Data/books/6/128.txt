The crystals were placed in pots, and the heat from the furnace
would distil the sulphuric acid. The operation was successfully
completed, and on the 20th of May, twelve days after commencing it,
the engineer was the possessor of the agent which later he hoped to
use in so many different ways.

Now, why did he wish for this agent? Simply to produce azotic
acid; and that was easy, since saltpeter, attacked by sulphuric
acid, gives azotic, or nitric, acid by distillation.

But, after all, how was he going to employ this azotic acid? His
companions were still ignorant of this, for he had not informed
them of the result at which he aimed.

However, the engineer had nearly accomplished his purpose, and
by a last operation he would procure the substance which had given
so much trouble.

Taking some azotic acid, he mixed it with glycerine, which had
been previously concentrated by evaporation, subjected to the
water-bath, and he obtained, without even employing a refrigerant
mixture, several pints of an oily yellow mixture.

This last operation Cyrus Harding had made alone, in a retired
place, at a distance from the Chimneys, for he feared the danger of
an explosion, and when he showed a bottle of this liquid to his
friends, he contented himself with saying,â€”

"Here is nitro-glycerine!"

It was really this terrible production, of which the explosive
power is perhaps tenfold that of ordinary powder, and which has
already caused so many accidents. However, since a way has been
found to transform it into dynamite, that is to say, to mix with it
some solid substance, clay or sugar, porous enough to hold it, the
dangerous liquid has been used with some security. But dynamite was
not yet known at the time when the settlers worked on Lincoln
Island.

"And is it that liquid that is going to blow up our rocks?" said
Pencroft incredulously.

"Yes, my friend," replied the engineer, "and this
nitro-glycerine will produce so much the more effect, as the
granite is extremely hard, and will oppose a greater resistance to
the explosion."

"And when shall we see this, captain?"
