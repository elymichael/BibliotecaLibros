<br/>At five o'clock in the evening, Cyrus Harding gave the signal to<br/>halt. They were now outside the forest, at the beginning of the<br/>powerful spurs which supported Mount Franklin towards the west. At<br/>a distance of some hundred feet flowed the Red Creek, and<br/>consequently plenty of fresh water was within their reach.<br/><br/>The camp was soon organized. In less than an hour, on the edge<br/>of the forest, among the trees, a hut of branches interlaced with<br/>creepers, and pasted over with clay, offered a tolerable shelter.<br/>Their geological researches were put off till the next day. Supper<br/>was prepared, a good fire blazed before the hut, the roast turned,<br/>and at eight o'clock, while one of the settlers watched to keep up<br/>the fire, in case any wild beasts should prowl in the neighborhood,<br/>the others slept soundly.<br/><br/>The next day, the 21st of April, Cyrus Harding accompanied by<br/>Herbert, went to look for the soil of ancient formation, on which<br/>he had already discovered a specimen of ore. They found the vein<br/>above ground, near the source of the creek, at the foot of one of<br/>the northeastern spurs. This ore, very rich in iron, enclosed in<br/>its fusible veinstone, was perfectly suited to the mode of<br/>reduction which the engineer intended to employ; that is, the<br/>Catalan method, but simplified, as it is used in Corsica. In fact,<br/>the Catalan method, properly so called, requires the construction<br/>of kilns and crucibles, in which the ore and the coal, placed in<br/>alternate layers, are transformed and reduced, But Cyrus Harding<br/>intended to economize these constructions, and wished simply to<br/>form, with the ore and the coal, a cubic mass, to the center of<br/>which he would direct the wind from his bellows. Doubtless, it was<br/>the proceeding employed by Tubalcain, and the first metallurgists<br/>of the inhabited world. Now that which had succeeded with the<br/>grandson of Adam, and which still yielded good results in countries<br/>which in ore and fuel, could not but succeed with the settlers in<br/>Lincoln Island.<br/><br/>The coal, as well as the ore, was collected without trouble on<br/>the surface of the ground. They first broke the ore into little<br/>pieces, and cleansed them with the hand from the impurities which<br/>soiled their surface. Then coal and ore were arranged in heaps and<br/>in successive layers, as the charcoal-burner does with the wood<br/>which he wishes to carbonize. In this way, under the influence of<br/>the air projected by the blowing-machine, the coal would be<br/>transformed into carbonic acid, then into oxide of carbon, its use<br/>being to reduce the oxide of iron, that is to say, to rid it of the<br/>oxygen.<br/><br/>Thus the engineer proceeded. The bellows of sealskin, furnished<br/>at its extremity with a nozzle of clay, which had been previously<br/>fabricated in the pottery kiln, was established near the heap of<br/>ore. Using the mechanism which consisted of a frame, cords of fiber<br/>and counterpoise, he threw into the mass an abundance of air, which<br/>by raising the temperature also concurred with the chemical<br/>transformation to produce in time pure iron.<br/><br/>The operation was difficult. All the patience, all the ingenuity<br/>of the settlers was needed; but at last it succeeded, and the<br/>result was a lump of iron, reduced to a spongy state, which it was<br/>necessary to shingle and fagot, that is to say, to forge so as to<br/>expel from it the liquefied veinstone. These amateur smiths had, of<br/>course, no hammer; but they were in no worse a situation than the<br/>first metallurgist, and therefore did what, no doubt, he had to<br/>do.<br/><br/>A handle was fixed to the first lump, and was used as a hammer<br/>to forge the second on a granite anvil, and thus they obtained a<br/>coarse but useful metal. At length, after many trials and much<br/>fatigue, on the 25th of April several bars of iron were forged, and<br/>transformed into tools, crowbars, pincers, pickaxes, spades, etc.,<br/>which Pencroft and Neb declared to be real jewels. But the metal<br/>was not yet in its most serviceable state, that is, of steel. Now<br/>steel is a combination of iron and coal, which is extracted, either<br/>from the liquid ore, by taking from it the excess of coal, or from<br/>the iron by adding to it the coal which was wanting. The first,<br/>obtained by the decarburation of the metal, gives natural or<br/>puddled steel; the second, produced by the carburation of the iron,<br/>gives steel of cementation.<br/><br/>It was the last which Cyrus Harding intended to forge, as he<br/>possessed iron in a pure state. He succeeded by heating the metal<br/>with powdered coal in a crucible which had previously been<br/>manufactured from clay suitable for the purpose.<br/><br/>He then worked this steel, which is malleable both when hot or<br/>cold, with the hammer. Neb and Pencroft, cleverly directed, made<br/>hatchets, which, heated red-hot, and plunged suddenly into cold<br/>water, acquired an excellent temper.<br/><br/>Other instruments, of course roughly fashioned, were also<br/>manufactured; blades for planes, axes, hatchets, pieces of steel to<br/>be transformed into saws, chisels; then iron for spades, pickaxes,<br/>hammers, nails, etc. At last, on the 5th of May, the metallic<br/>period ended, the smiths returned to the Chimneys, and new work<br/>would soon authorize them to take a fresh title.<br/><br/>
