<br/>And, in fact, in several places they could distinguish traces,<br/>more or less recent, of the passage of a band of men—here branches<br/>broken off the trees, perhaps to mark out the way; there the ashes<br/>of a fire, and footprints in clayey spots; but nothing which<br/>appeared to belong to a settled encampment.<br/><br/>The engineer had recommended his companions to refrain from<br/>hunting. The reports of the firearms might give the alarm to the<br/>convicts, who were, perhaps, roaming through the forest. Moreover,<br/>the hunters would necessarily ramble some distance from the cart,<br/>which it was dangerous to leave unguarded.<br/><br/>In the afterpart of the day, when about six miles from Granite<br/>House, their progress became much more difficult. In order to make<br/>their way through some thickets, they were obliged to cut down<br/>trees. Before entering such places Harding was careful to send in<br/>Top and Jup, who faithfully accomplished their commission, and when<br/>the dog and orang returned without giving any warning, there was<br/>evidently nothing to fear, either from convicts or wild beasts, two<br/>varieties of the animal kingdom, whose ferocious instincts placed<br/>them on the same level. On the evening of the first day the<br/>colonists encamped about nine miles from Granite House, on the<br/>border of a little stream falling into the Mercy, and of the<br/>existence of which they had till then been ignorant; it evidently,<br/>however, belonged to the hydiographical system to which the soil<br/>owed its astonishing fertility. The settlers made a hearty meal,<br/>for their appetites were sharpened, and measures were then taken<br/>that the night might be passed in safety. If the engineer had had<br/>only to deal with wild beasts, jaguars or others, he would have<br/>simply lighted fires all around his camp, which would have sufficed<br/>for its defense; but the convicts would be rather attracted than<br/>terrified by the flames, and it was, therefore, better to be<br/>surrounded by the profound darkness of night.<br/><br/>The watch was, however, carefully organized. Two of the settlers<br/>were to watch together, and every two hours it was agreed that they<br/>should be relieved by their comrades. And so, notwithstanding his<br/>wish to the contrary, Herbert was exempted from guard. Pencroft and<br/>Gideon Spilett in one party, the engineer and Neb in another,<br/>mounted guard in turns over the camp.<br/><br/>The night, however, was but of few hours. The darkness was due<br/>rather to the thickness of the foliage than to the disappearance of<br/>the sun. The silence was scarcely disturbed by the howling of<br/>jaguars and the chattering of the monkeys, the latter appearing to<br/>particularly irritate Master Jup. The night passed without<br/>incident, and on the next day, the 15th of February, the journey<br/>through the forest, tedious rather than difficult, was continued.<br/>This day they could not accomplish more than six miles, for every<br/>moment they were obliged to cut a road with their hatchets.<br/><br/>Like true settlers, the colonists spared the largest and most<br/>beautiful trees, which would besides have cost immense labor to<br/>fell, and the small ones only were sacrificed, but the result was<br/>that the road took a very winding direction, and lengthened itself<br/>by numerous detours.<br/><br/>During the day Herbert discovered several new specimens not<br/>before met with in the island, such as the tree-fern, with its<br/>leaves spread out like the waters of a fountain, locust-trees, on<br/>the long pods of which the onagers browsed greedily, and which<br/>supplied a sweet pulp of excellent flavor. There, too, the<br/>colonists again found groups of magnificent kauries, their<br/>cylindrical trunks, crowded with a cone of verdure, rising to a<br/>height of two hundred feet. These were the tree-kings of New<br/>Zealand, as celebrated as the cedars of Lebanon.<br/><br/>As to the fauna, there was no addition to those species already<br/>known to the hunters. Nevertheless, they saw, though unable to get<br/>near them, a couple of those large birds peculiar to Australia, a<br/>sort of cassowary, called emu, five feet in height, and with brown<br/>plumage, which belong to the tribe of waders. Top darted after them<br/>as fast as his four legs could carry him, but the emus distanced<br/>him with ease, so prodigious was their speed.<br/><br/>As to the traces left by the convicts, a few more were<br/>discovered. Some footprints found near an apparently recently<br/>extinguished fire were attentively examined by the settlers. By<br/>measuring them one after the other, according to their length and<br/>breadth, the marks of five men's feet were easily distinguished.<br/>The five convicts had evidently camped on this spot; but,—and this<br/>was the object of so minute an examination,—a sixth footprint could<br/>not be discovered, which in that case would have been that of<br/>Ayrton.<br/><br/>"Ayrton was not with them!" said Herbert.<br/><br/>
