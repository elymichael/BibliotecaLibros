The wire was there fastened to the rock.

"Forward!" said Harding.

And the two oars, plunging into the dark waters, urged the boat
onwards.

On they went for another quarter of an hour, and a distance of
half-a- mile must have been cleared from the mouth of the cave,
when Harding's voice was again heard.

"Stop!" said he.

The boat stopped, and the colonists perceived a bright light
illuminating the vast cavern, so deeply excavated in the bowels of
the island, of which nothing had ever led them to suspect the
existence.

At a height of a hundred feet rose the vaulted roof, supported
on basalt shafts. Irregular arches, strange moldings, appeared on
the columns erected by nature in thousands from the first epochs of
the formation of the globe. The basalt pillars, fitted one into the
other, measured from forty to fifty feet in height, and the water,
calm in spite of the tumult outside, washed their base. The
brilliant focus of light, pointed out by the engineer, touched
every point of rocks, and flooded the walls with light.

By reflection the water reproduced the brilliant sparkles, so
that the boat appeared to be floating between two glittering zones.
They could not be mistaken in the nature of the irradiation thrown
from the glowing nucleus, whose clear rays were shattered by all
the angles, all the projections of the cavern. This light proceeded
from an electric source, and its white color betrayed its origin.
It was the sun of this cave, and it filled it entirely.

At a sign from Cyrus Harding the oars again plunged into the
water, causing a regular shower of gems, and the boat was urged
forward towards the light, which was now not more than half a
cable's length distant.

At this place the breadth of the sheet of water measured nearly
350 feet, and beyond the dazzling center could be seen an enormous
basaltic wall, blocking up any issue on that side. The cavern
widened here considerably, the sea forming a little lake. But the
roof, the side walls, the end cliff, all the prisms, all the peaks,
were flooded with the electric fluid, so that the brilliancy
belonged to them, and as if the light issued from them.

In the center of the lake a long cigar-shaped object floated on
the surface of the water, silent, motionless. The brilliancy which
issued from it escaped from its sides as from two kilns heated to a
white heat. This apparatus, similar in shape to an enormous whale,
was about 250 feet long, and rose about ten or twelve above the
water.
