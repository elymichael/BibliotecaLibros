As to the dictionaries of natural science and Polynesian idioms,<br/>both were English; but they neither bore the name of the publisher<br/>nor the date of publication.<br/><br/>The same with the Bible printed in English, in quarto,<br/>remarkable from a typographic point of view, and which appeared to<br/>have been often used.<br/><br/>The atlas was a magnificent work, comprising maps of every<br/>country in the world, and several planispheres arranged upon<br/>Mercator's projection, and of which the nomenclature was in<br/>French—but which also bore neither date nor name of publisher.<br/><br/>There was nothing, therefore, on these different articles by<br/>which they could be traced, and nothing consequently of a nature to<br/>show the nationality of the vessel which must have recently passed<br/>these shores.<br/><br/>But, wherever the chest might have come from, it was a treasure<br/>to the settlers on Lincoln Island. Till then, by making use of the<br/>productions of nature, they had created everything for themselves,<br/>and, thanks to their intelligence, they had managed without<br/>difficulty. But did it not appear as if Providence had wished to<br/>reward them by sending them these productions of human industry?<br/>Their thanks rose unanimously to Heaven.<br/><br/>However, one of them was not quite satisfied: it was Pencroft.<br/>It appeared that the chest did not contain something which he<br/>evidently held in great esteem, for in proportion as they<br/>approached the bottom of the box, his hurrahs diminished in<br/>heartiness, and, the inventory finished, he was heard to mutter<br/>these words:—"That's all very fine, but you can see that there is<br/>nothing for me in that box!"<br/><br/>This led Neb to say,—<br/><br/>"Why, friend Pencroft, what more do you expect?"<br/><br/>"Half a pound of tobacco," replied Pencroft seriously, "and<br/>nothing would have been wanting to complete my happiness!"<br/><br/>No one could help laughing at this speech of the sailor's.<br/><br/>But the result of this discovery of the chest was, that it was<br/>now more than ever necessary to explore the island thoroughly. It<br/>was therefore agreed that the next morning at break of day, they<br/>should set out, by ascending the Mercy so as to reach the western<br/>shore. If any castaways had landed on the coast, it was to be<br/>feared they were without resources, and it was therefore the more<br/>necessary to carry help to them without delay.<br/>
