<br/>In consequence and in view of these future establishments, it<br/>became of much importance that they should penetrate into all the<br/>yet unknown parts of Lincoln Island, that is to say, through that<br/>thick forest which extended on the right bank of the Mercy, from<br/>its mouth to the extremity of the Serpentine Peninsula, as well as<br/>on the whole of its western side. But this needed settled weather,<br/>and a month must pass before this exploration could be profitably<br/>undertaken.<br/><br/>They therefore waited with some impatience, when an incident<br/>occurred which increased the desire the settlers had to visit the<br/>whole of their domain.<br/><br/>It was the 24th of October. On this day, Pencroft had gone to<br/>visit his traps, which he always kept properly baited. In one of<br/>them he found three animals which would be very welcome for the<br/>larder. They were a female peccary and her two young ones.<br/><br/>Pencroft then returned to Granite House, enchanted with his<br/>capture, and, as usual, he made a great show of his game.<br/><br/>"Come, we shall have a grand feast, captain!" he exclaimed. "And<br/>you too, Mr. Spilett, you will eat some!"<br/><br/>"I shall be very happy," replied the reporter; "but what is it<br/>that I am going to eat?"<br/><br/>"Suckling-pig."<br/><br/>"Oh, indeed, suckling-pig, Pencroft? To hear you, I thought that<br/>you were bringing back a young partridge stuffed with<br/>truffles!"<br/><br/>"What?" cried Pencroft. "Do you mean to say that you turn up<br/>your nose at suckling-pig?'<br/><br/>"No," replied Gideon Spilett, without showing any enthusiasm;<br/>"provided one doesn't eat too much"<br/><br/>
