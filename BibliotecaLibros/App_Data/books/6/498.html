<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>17<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>Day had returned. No ray of light penetrated into the profundity<br/>of the cavern. It being high-water, the entrance was closed by the<br/>sea. But the artificial light, which escaped in long streams from<br/>the skylights of the "Nautilus" was as vivid as before, and the<br/>sheet of water shone around the floating vessel.<br/><br/>An extreme exhaustion now overcame Captain Nemo, who had fallen<br/>back upon the divan. It was useless to contemplate removing him to<br/>Granite House, for he had expressed his wish to remain in the midst<br/>of those marvels of the "Nautilus" which millions could not have<br/>purchased, and to wait there for that death which was swiftly<br/>approaching.<br/><br/>During a long interval of prostration, which rendered him almost<br/>unconscious, Cyrus Harding and Gideon Spilett attentively observed<br/>the condition of the dying man. It was apparent that his strength<br/>was gradually diminishing. That frame, once so robust, was now but<br/>the fragile tenement of a departing soul. All of life was<br/>concentrated in the heart and head.<br/><br/>The engineer and reporter consulted in whispers. Was it possible<br/>to render any aid to the dying man? Might his life, if not saved,<br/>be prolonged for some days? He himself had said that no remedy<br/>could avail, and he awaited with tranquillity that death which had<br/>for him no terrors.<br/><br/>"We can do nothing," said Gideon Spilett.<br/><br/>"But of what is he dying?" asked Pencroft.<br/><br/>
