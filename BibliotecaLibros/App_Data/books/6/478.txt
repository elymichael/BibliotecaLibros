The sailor's sentence was cut short by a new tinkle of the
bell.

Harding went to the apparatus, and sent this question to the
corral:—

"What do you want?"

A few moments later the needle, moving on the alphabetic dial,
gave this reply to the tenants of Granite House:—

"Come to the corral immediately."

"At last!" exclaimed Harding.

Yes! At last! The mystery was about to be unveiled. The
colonists' fatigue had disappeared before the tremendous interest
which was about to urge them to the corral, and all wish for rest
had ceased. Without having uttered a word, in a few moments they
had left Granite House, and were standing on the beach. Jup and Top
alone were left behind. They could do without them.

The night was black. The new moon had disappeared at the same
time as the sun. As Herbert had observed, great stormy clouds
formed a lowering and heavy vault, preventing any star rays. A few
lightning flashes, reflections from a distant storm, illuminated
the horizon.

It was possible that a few hours later the thunder would roll
over the island itself. The night was very threatening.

But however deep the darkness was, it would not prevent them
from finding the familiar road to the corral.

They ascended the left bank of the Mercy, reached the plateau,
passed the bridge over Creek Glycerine, and advanced through the
forest.
