"Mr. Harding, I wish to speak with youâ€”alone!"<br/><br/>The engineer's companions, respecting the wish, retired.<br/><br/>Cyrus Harding remained but a few minutes alone with Captain<br/>Nemo, and soon recalled his companions; but he said nothing to them<br/>of the private matters which the dying man had confided to him.<br/><br/>Gideon Spilett now watched the captain with extreme care. It was<br/>evident that he was no longer sustained by his moral energy, which<br/>had lost the power of reaction against his physical weakness.<br/><br/>The day closed without change. The colonists did not quit the<br/>"Nautilus" for a moment. Night arrived, although it was impossible<br/>to distinguish it from day in the cavern.<br/><br/>Captain Nemo suffered no pain, but he was visibly sinking. His<br/>noble features, paled by the approach of death, were perfectly<br/>calm. Inaudible words escaped at intervals from his lips, bearing<br/>upon various incidents of his checkered career. Life was evidently<br/>ebbing slowly and his extremities were already cold.<br/><br/>Once or twice more he spoke to the colonists who stood around<br/>him, and smiled on them with that last smile which continues after<br/>death.<br/><br/>At length, shortly after midnight, Captain Nemo by a supreme<br/>effort succeeded in folding his arms across his breast, as if<br/>wishing in that attitude to compose himself for death.<br/><br/>By one o'clock his glance alone showed signs of life. A dying<br/>light gleamed in those eyes once so brilliant. Then, murmuring the<br/>words, "God and my country!" he quietly expired.<br/><br/>Cyrus Harding, bending low closed the eyes of him who had once<br/>been the Prince Dakkar, and was now not even Captain Nemo.<br/><br/>Herbert and Pencroft sobbed aloud. Tears fell from Ayrton's<br/>eyes. Neb was on his knees by the reporter's side, motionless as a<br/>statue.<br/>
