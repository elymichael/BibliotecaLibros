"Perhaps," replied the engineer, "but we will begin by first<br/>manufacturing some bows and arrows, and I don't doubt that you will<br/>become as clever in the use of them as the Australian hunters."<br/><br/>"Bows and arrows!" said Pencroft scornfully. "That's all very<br/>well for children!"<br/><br/>"Don't be proud, friend Pencroft," replied the reporter. "Bows<br/>and arrows were sufficient for centuries to stain the earth with<br/>blood. Powder is but a thing of yesterday, and war is as old as the<br/>human race—unhappily."<br/><br/>"Faith, that's true, Mr. Spilett," replied the sailor, "and I<br/>always speak too quickly. You must excuse me!"<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Herbert constant to his favorite science, Natural<br/>History, reverted to the kangaroos, saying,—<br/><br/>"Besides, we had to deal just now with the species which is most<br/>difficult to catch. They were giants with long gray fur; but if I<br/>am not mistaken, there exist black and red kangaroos, rock<br/>kangaroos, and rat kangaroos, which are more easy to get hold of.<br/>It is reckoned that there are about a dozen species."<br/><br/>"Herbert," replied the sailor sententiously, "there is only one<br/>species of kangaroos to me, that is 'kangaroo on the spit,' and<br/>it's just the one we haven't got this evening!"<br/><br/>They could not help laughing at Master Pencroft's new<br/>classification. The honest sailor did not hide his regret at being<br/>reduced for dinner to the singing pheasants, but fortune once more<br/>showed itself obliging to him.<br/><br/>In fact, Top, who felt that his interest was concerned went and<br/>ferreted everywhere with an instinct doubled by a ferocious<br/>appetite. It was even probable that if some piece of game did fall<br/>into his clutches, none would be left for the hunters, if Top was<br/>hunting on his own account; but Neb watched him and he did<br/>well.<br/><br/>Towards three o'clock the dog disappeared in the brushwood and<br/>gruntings showed that he was engaged in a struggle with some<br/>animal. Neb rushed after him, and soon saw Top eagerly devouring a<br/>quadruped, which ten seconds later would have been past recognizing<br/>in Top's stomach. But fortunately the dog had fallen upon a brood,<br/>and besides the victim he was devouring, two other rodents—the<br/>animals in question belonged to that order—lay strangled on the<br/>turf.<br/><br/>Neb reappeared triumphantly holding one of the rodents in each<br/>hand. Their size exceeded that of a rabbit, their hair was yellow,<br/>mingled with green spots, and they had the merest rudiments of<br/>tails.<br/>
