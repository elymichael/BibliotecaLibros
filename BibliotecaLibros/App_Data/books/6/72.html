<br/>"To-morrow," he repeated, "we shall know what we have to depend<br/>upon, and we will act accordingly."<br/><br/>The meal ended, fresh armfuls of wood were thrown on the fire,<br/>and the inhabitants of the Chimneys, including the faithful Top,<br/>were soon buried in a deep sleep.<br/><br/>No incident disturbed this peaceful night, and the next day, the<br/>29th of March, fresh and active they awoke, ready to undertake the<br/>excursion which must determine their fate.<br/><br/>All was ready for the start. The remains of the capybara would<br/>be enough to sustain Harding and his companions for at least<br/>twenty-four hours.<br/><br/>Besides, they hoped to find more food on the way. As the glasses<br/>had been returned to the watches of the engineer and reporter,<br/>Pencroft burned a little linen to serve as tinder. As to flint,<br/>that would not be wanting in these regions of Plutonic origin. It<br/>was half-past seven in the morning when the explorers, armed with<br/>sticks, left the Chimneys. Following Pencroft's advice, it appeared<br/>best to take the road already traversed through the forest, and to<br/>return by another route. It was also the most direct way to reach<br/>the mountain. They turned the south angle and followed the left<br/>bank of the river, which was abandoned at the point where it formed<br/>an elbow towards the southwest. The path, already trodden under the<br/>evergreen trees, was found, and at nine o'clock Cyrus Harding and<br/>his companions had reached the western border of the forest. The<br/>ground, till then, very little undulated, boggy at first, dry and<br/>sandy afterwards, had a gentle slope, which ascended from the shore<br/>towards the interior of the country. A few very timid animals were<br/>seen under the forest-trees. Top quickly started them, but his<br/>master soon called him back, for the time had not come to commence<br/>hunting; that would be attended to later. The engineer was not a<br/>man who would allow himself to be diverted from his fixed idea. It<br/>might even have been said that he did not observe the country at<br/>all, either in its configuration or in its natural productions, his<br/>great aim being to climb the mountain before him, and therefore<br/>straight towards it he went. At ten o'clock a halt of a few minutes<br/>was made. On leaving the forest, the mountain system of the country<br/>appeared before the explorers. The mountain was composed of two<br/>cones; the first, truncated at a height of about two thousand five<br/>hundred feet, was sustained by buttresses, which appeared to branch<br/>out like the talons of an immense claw set on the ground. Between<br/>these were narrow valleys, bristling with trees, the last clumps of<br/>which rose to the top of the lowest cone. There appeared to be less<br/>vegetation on that side of the mountain which was exposed to the<br/>northeast, and deep fissures could be seen which, no doubt, were<br/>watercourses.<br/><br/>On the first cone rested a second, slightly rounded, and placed<br/>a little on one side, like a great round hat cocked over the ear. A<br/>Scotchman would have said, "His bonnet was a thocht ajee." It<br/>appeared formed of bare earth, here and there pierced by reddish<br/>rocks.<br/><br/>They wished to reach the second cone, and proceeding along the<br/>ridge of the spurs seemed to be the best way by which to gain<br/>it.<br/><br/>"We are on volcanic ground," Cyrus Harding had said, and his<br/>companions following him began to ascend by degrees on the back of<br/>a spur, which, by a winding and consequently more accessible path,<br/>joined the first plateau.<br/><br/>The ground had evidently been convulsed by subterranean force.<br/>Here and there stray blocks, numerous debris of basalt and<br/>pumice-stone, were met with. In isolated groups rose fir-trees,<br/>which, some hundred feet lower, at the bottom of the narrow gorges,<br/>formed massive shades almost impenetrable to the sun's rays.<br/><br/>During the first part of the ascent, Herbert remarked on the<br/>footprints which indicated the recent passage of large animals.<br/><br/>
