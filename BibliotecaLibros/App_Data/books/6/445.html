<br/>However, Herbert's convalescence progressed rapidly. The<br/>congestion of the liver had disappeared, and his wounds might be<br/>considered completely healed.<br/><br/>During the month of January, important work was done on the<br/>plateau of Prospect Heights; but it consisted solely in saving as<br/>much as was possible from the devastated crops, either of corn or<br/>vegetables. The grain and the plants were gathered, so as to<br/>provide a new harvest for the approaching half-season. With regard<br/>to rebuilding the poultry-yard, wall, or stables, Cyrus Harding<br/>preferred to wait. While he and his companions were in pursuit of<br/>the convicts, the latter might very probably pay another visit to<br/>the plateau, and it would be useless to give them an opportunity of<br/>recommencing their work of destruction. when the island should be<br/>cleared of these miscreants, they would set about rebuilding. The<br/>young convalescent began to get up in the second week of January,<br/>at first for one hour a day, then two, then three. His strength<br/>visibly returned, so vigorous was his constitution. He was now<br/>eighteen years of age. He was tall, and promised to become a man of<br/>noble and commanding presence. From this time his recovery, while<br/>still requiring care,—and Dr. Spilett was very strict,—made rapid<br/>progress. Towards the end of the month, Herbert was already walking<br/>about on Prospect Heights, and the beach.<br/><br/>He derived, from several sea-baths, which he took in company<br/>with Pencroft and Neb, the greatest possible benefit. Cyrus Harding<br/>thought he might now settle the day for their departure, for which<br/>the 15th of February was fixed. The nights, very clear at this time<br/>of year, would be favorable to the researches they intended to make<br/>all over the island.<br/><br/>The necessary preparations for this exploration were now<br/>commenced, and were important, for the colonists had sworn not to<br/>return to Granite House until their twofold object had been<br/>achieved; on the one hand, to exterminate the convicts, and rescue<br/>Ayrton, if he was still living; on the other, to discover who it<br/>was that presided so effectually over the fortunes of the<br/>colony.<br/><br/>Of Lincoln Island, the settlers knew thoroughly all the eastern<br/>coast from Claw Cape to the Mandible Capes, the extensive Tadorn<br/>Marsh, the neighborhood of Lake Grant, Jacamar Wood, between the<br/>road to the corral and the Mercy, the courses of the Mercy and Red<br/>Creek, and lastly, the spurs of Mount Franklin, among which the<br/>corral had been established.<br/><br/>They had explored, though only in an imperfect manner, the vast<br/>shore of Washington Bay from Claw Cape to Reptile End, the woody<br/>and marshy border of the west coast, and the interminable downs,<br/>ending at the open mouth of Shark Gulf. But they had in no way<br/>surveyed the woods which covered the Serpentine Peninsula, all to<br/>the right of the Mercy, the left bank of Falls River, and the<br/>wilderness of spurs and valleys which supported three quarters of<br/>the base of Mount Franklin, to the east, the north, and the west,<br/>and where doubtless many secret retreats existed. Consequently,<br/>many millions of acres of the island had still escaped their<br/>investigations.<br/><br/>It was, therefore, decided that the expedition should be carried<br/>through the Far West, so as to include all that region situated on<br/>the right of the Mercy.<br/><br/>It might, perhaps, be better worth while to go direct to the<br/>corral, where it might be supposed that the convicts had again<br/>taken refuge, either to pillage or to establish themselves there.<br/>But either the devastation of the corral would have been an<br/>accomplished fact by this time, and it would be too late to prevent<br/>it, or it had been the convicts' interest to entrench themselves<br/>there, and there would be still time to go and turn them out on<br/>their return.<br/><br/>Therefore, after some discussion, the first plan was adhered to,<br/>and the settlers resolved to proceed through the wood to Reptile<br/>End. They would make their way with their hatchets, and thus lay<br/>the first draft of a road which would place Granite House in<br/>communication with the end of the peninsula for a length of from<br/>sixteen to seventeen miles.<br/><br/>The cart was in good condition. The onagers, well rested, could<br/>go a long journey. Provisions, camp effects, a portable stove, and<br/>various utensils were packed in the cart, as also weapons and<br/>ammunition, carefully chosen from the now complete arsenal of<br/>Granite House. But it was necessary to remember that the convicts<br/>were, perhaps, roaming about the woods, and that in the midst of<br/>these thick forests a shot might quickly be fired and received. It<br/>was therefore resolved that the little band of settlers should<br/>remain together and not separate under any pretext whatever.<br/><br/>
