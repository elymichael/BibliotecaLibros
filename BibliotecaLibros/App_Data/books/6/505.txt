"Mr. Harding, I wish to speak with youâ€”alone!"

The engineer's companions, respecting the wish, retired.

Cyrus Harding remained but a few minutes alone with Captain
Nemo, and soon recalled his companions; but he said nothing to them
of the private matters which the dying man had confided to him.

Gideon Spilett now watched the captain with extreme care. It was
evident that he was no longer sustained by his moral energy, which
had lost the power of reaction against his physical weakness.

The day closed without change. The colonists did not quit the
"Nautilus" for a moment. Night arrived, although it was impossible
to distinguish it from day in the cavern.

Captain Nemo suffered no pain, but he was visibly sinking. His
noble features, paled by the approach of death, were perfectly
calm. Inaudible words escaped at intervals from his lips, bearing
upon various incidents of his checkered career. Life was evidently
ebbing slowly and his extremities were already cold.

Once or twice more he spoke to the colonists who stood around
him, and smiled on them with that last smile which continues after
death.

At length, shortly after midnight, Captain Nemo by a supreme
effort succeeded in folding his arms across his breast, as if
wishing in that attitude to compose himself for death.

By one o'clock his glance alone showed signs of life. A dying
light gleamed in those eyes once so brilliant. Then, murmuring the
words, "God and my country!" he quietly expired.

Cyrus Harding, bending low closed the eyes of him who had once
been the Prince Dakkar, and was now not even Captain Nemo.

Herbert and Pencroft sobbed aloud. Tears fell from Ayrton's
eyes. Neb was on his knees by the reporter's side, motionless as a
statue.
