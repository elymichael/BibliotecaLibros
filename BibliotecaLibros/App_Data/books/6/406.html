"No! I can swear to it. This is a reef knot, and I always make a<br/>running bowline."<br/><br/>"You must be mistaken, Pencroft."<br/><br/>"I am not mistaken!" declared the sailor. "My hand does it so<br/>naturally, and one's hand is never mistaken!"<br/><br/>"Then can the convicts have been on board?" asked Herbert.<br/><br/>"I know nothing about that," answered Pencroft, "but what is<br/>certain, is that some one has weighed the 'Bonadventure's' anchor<br/>and dropped it again! And look here, here is another proof! The<br/>cable of the anchor has been run out, and its service is no longer<br/>at the hawse-hole. I repeat that some one has been using our<br/>vessel!"<br/><br/>"But if the convicts had used her, they would have pillaged her,<br/>or rather gone off with her."<br/><br/>"Gone off! where toâ€”to Tabor Island?" replied Pencroft. "Do you<br/>think, they would risk themselves in a boat of such small<br/>tonnage?"<br/><br/>"We must, besides, be sure that they know of the islet,"<br/>rejoined the reporter.<br/><br/>"However that may be," said the sailor, "as sure as my name is<br/>Bonadventure Pencroft, of the Vineyard, our 'Bonadventure' has<br/>sailed without us!"<br/><br/>The sailor was positive that neither Gideon Spilett nor Herbert<br/>could dispute his statement. It was evident that the vessel had<br/>been moved, more or less, since Pencroft had brought her to Port<br/>Balloon. As to the sailor, he had not the slightest doubt that the<br/>anchor had been raised and then dropped again. Now, what was the<br/>use of these two maneuvers, unless the vessel had been employed in<br/>some expedition?<br/><br/>"But how was it we did not see the 'Bonadventure' pass in the<br/>sight of the island?" observed the reporter, who was anxious to<br/>bring forward every possible objection.<br/>
