Well, I don't like such jokes, and the joker had better<br/>look out for himself, if he falls into my hands, I can tell<br/>him."<br/><br/>As soon as the first gleam of light appeared in the east, the<br/>colonists, suitably armed, repaired to the beach under Granite<br/>House. The rising sun now shone on the cliff and they could see the<br/>windows, the shutters of which were closed, through the curtains of<br/>foliage.<br/><br/>All here was in order; but a cry escaped the colonists when they<br/>saw that the door, which they had closed on their departure, was<br/>now wide open.<br/><br/>Some one had entered Granite Houseâ€”there could be no more doubt<br/>about that.<br/><br/>The upper ladder, which generally hung from the door to the<br/>landing, was in its place, but the lower ladder was drawn up and<br/>raised to the threshold.

Hallo there, you<br/>pirates, brigands, robbers, sons of John Bull!"<br/><br/>When Pencroft, being a Yankee, treated any one to the epithet of<br/>"son of John Bull," he considered he had reached the last limits of<br/>insult.<br/><br/>The sun had now completely risen, and the whole facade of<br/>Granite House became illuminated by its rays; but in the interior<br/>as well as on the exterior all was quiet and calm.<br/><br/>
