"Good! And do you think now that she could undertake a voyage of
some extent?"

"What voyage, Pencroft?"

"One to Tabor Island, for instance."

"My friend," replied Harding, "I think that in any pressing
emergency we need not hesitate to trust ourselves to the
'Bonadventure' even for a longer voyage; but you know I should see
you set off to Tabor Island with great uneasiness, since nothing
obliges you to go there."

"One likes to know one's neighbors," returned the sailor, who
was obstinate in his idea. "Tabor Island is our neighbor, and the
only one! Politeness requires us to go at least to pay a
visit."

"By Jove," said Spilett, "our friend Pencroft has become very
particular about the proprieties all at once!"

"I am not particular about anything at all," retorted the
sailor, who was rather vexed by the engineer's opposition, but who
did not wish to cause him anxiety.

"Consider, Pencroft," resumed Harding, "you cannot go alone to
Tabor Island."

"One companion will be enough for me."

"Even so," replied the engineer, "you will risk depriving the
colony of Lincoln Island of two settlers out of five."

"Out of six," answered Pencroft; "you forget Jup."
