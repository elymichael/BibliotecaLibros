<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>20<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>The winter season set in with the month of June, which<br/>corresponds with the month of December in the Northern Hemisphere.<br/>It began with showers and squalls, which succeeded each other<br/>without intermission. The tenants of Granite House could appreciate<br/>the advantages of a dwelling which sheltered them from the<br/>inclement weather. The Chimneys would have been quite insufficient<br/>to protect them against the rigor of winter, and it was to be<br/>feared that the high tides would make another irruption. Cyrus<br/>Harding had taken precautions against this contingency, so as to<br/>preserve as much as possible the forge and furnace which were<br/>established there.<br/><br/>During the whole of the month of June the time was employed in<br/>different occupations, which excluded neither hunting nor fishing,<br/>the larder being, therefore, abundantly supplied. Pencroft, so soon<br/>as he had leisure, proposed to set some traps, from which he<br/>expected great results. He soon made some snares with creepers, by<br/>the aid of which the warren henceforth every day furnished its<br/>quota of rodents. Neb employed nearly all his time in salting or<br/>smoking meat, which insured their always having plenty of<br/>provisions. The question of clothes was now seriously discussed,<br/>the settlers having no other garments than those they wore when the<br/>balloon threw them on the island. These clothes were warm and good;<br/>they had taken great care of them as well as of their linen, and<br/>they were perfectly whole, but they would soon need to be replaced.<br/>Moreover, if the winter was severe, the settlers would suffer<br/>greatly from cold.<br/><br/>On this subject the ingenuity of Harding was at fault. They must<br/>provide for their most pressing wants, settle their dwelling, and<br/>lay in a store of food; thus the cold might come upon them before<br/>the question of clothes had been settled. They must therefore make<br/>up their minds to pass this first winter without additional<br/>clothing. When the fine season came round again, they would<br/>regularly hunt those musmons which had been seen on the expedition<br/>to Mount Franklin, and the wool once collected, the engineer would<br/>know how to make it into strong warm stuffâ€¦ . How? He would<br/>consider.<br/><br/>"Well, we are free to roast ourselves at Granite House!" said<br/>Pencroft. "There are heaps of fuel, and no reason for sparing<br/>it."<br/><br/>"Besides," added Gideon Spilett, "Lincoln Island is not situated<br/>under a very high latitude, and probably the winters here are not<br/>severe. Did you not say, Cyrus, that this thirty-fifth parallel<br/>corresponded to that of Spain in the other hemisphere?"<br/><br/>"Doubtless," replied the engineer, "but some winters in Spain<br/>are very cold! No want of snow and ice; and perhaps Lincoln Island<br/>is just as rigourously tried. However, it is an island, and as<br/>such, I hope that the temperature will be more moderate."<br/><br/>
