"Friends!—for me! friends!" exclaimed the stranger, hiding his
face in his hands. "No—never—leave me! leave me!"

Then he rushed to the side of the plateau which overlooked the
sea, and remained there a long time motionless.

Harding rejoined his companions and related to them what had
just happened.

"Yes! there is some mystery in that man's life," said Gideon
Spilett, "and it appears as if he had only re-entered society by
the path of remorse."

"I don't know what sort of a man we have brought here," said the
sailor. "He has secrets—"

"Which we will respect," interrupted Cyrus Harding quickly. "If
he has committed any crime, he has most fearfully expiated it, and
in our eyes he is absolved."

For two hours the stranger remained alone on the shore,
evidently under the influence of recollections which recalled all
his past life—a melancholy life doubtless—and the colonists,
without losing sight of him, did not attempt to disturb his
solitude. However, after two hours, appearing to have formed a
resolution, he came to find Cyrus Harding. His eyes were red with
the tears he had shed, but he wept no longer. His countenance
expressed deep humility. He appeared anxious, timorous, ashamed,
and his eyes were constantly fixed on the ground.

"Sir," said he to Harding, "your companions and you, are you
English?"

"No," answered the engineer, "we are Americans."

"Ah!" said the stranger, and he murmured, "I prefer that!"
