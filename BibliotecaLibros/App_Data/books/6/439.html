Gideon Spilett had not left Herbert, who, it was only too<br/>certain, was now seized by an intermittent fever, and this fever<br/>must be cured at any cost before it should assume a more serious<br/>aspect.<br/><br/>"And in order to cure it," said Spilett to Cyrus Harding, "we<br/>need a febrifuge."<br/><br/>"A febrifugeâ€”" answered the engineer. "We have neither Peruvian<br/>bark, nor sulphate of quinine."<br/><br/>"No," said Gideon Spilett, "but there are willows on the border<br/>of the lake, and the bark of the willow might, perhaps, prove to be<br/>a substitute for quinine."<br/><br/>"Let us try it without losing a moment," replied Cyrus<br/>Harding.<br/><br/>The bark of the willow has, indeed, been justly considered as a<br/>succedaneum for Peruvian bark, as has also that of the<br/>horse-chestnut tree, the leaf of the holly, the snake-root, etc. It<br/>was evidently necessary to make trial of this substance, although<br/>not so valuable as Peruvian bark, and to employ it in its natural<br/>state, since they had no means for extracting its essence.<br/><br/>Cyrus Harding went himself to cut from the trunk of a species of<br/>black willow, a few pieces of bark; he brought them back to Granite<br/>House, and reduced them to a powder, which was administered that<br/>same evening to Herbert.<br/><br/>The night passed without any important change. Herbert was<br/>somewhat delirious, but the fever did not reappear in the night,<br/>and did not return either during the following day.<br/><br/>Pencroft again began to hope. Gideon Spilett said nothing. It<br/>might be that the fever was not quotidian, but tertian, and that it<br/>would return next day. Therefore, he awaited the next day with the<br/>greatest anxiety.<br/><br/>It might have been remarked besides that during this period<br/>Herbert remained utterly prostrate, his head weak and giddy.<br/>Another symptom alarmed the reporter to the highest degree.<br/>Herbert's liver became congested, and soon a more intense delirium<br/>showed that his brain was also affected.<br/><br/>Gideon Spilett was overwhelmed by this new complication. He took<br/>the engineer aside.<br/>
