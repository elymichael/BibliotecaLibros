"What is especially curious," observed Harding, "is that the<br/>gulf has been formed by two rivers of lava, thrown out by the<br/>volcano, and accumulated by successive eruptions. The result is<br/>that the gulf is completely sheltered on all sides, and I believe<br/>that even in the stormiest weather, the sea here must be as calm as<br/>a lake."<br/><br/>"No doubt," returned the sailor, "since the wind has only that<br/>narrow entrance between the two capes to get in by, and, besides,<br/>the north cape protects that of the south in a way which would make<br/>the entrance of gusts very difficult. I declare our 'Bonadventure'<br/>could stay here from one end of the year to the other, without even<br/>dragging at her anchor!"<br/><br/>"It is rather large for her!" observed the reporter.<br/><br/>"Well! Mr. Spilett," replied the sailor, "I agree that it is too<br/>large for the 'Bonadventure,' but if the fleets of the Union were<br/>in want of a harbor in the Pacific, I don't think they would ever<br/>find a better place than this!"<br/><br/>"We are in the shark's mouth," remarked Nab, alluding to the<br/>form of the gulf.<br/><br/>"Right into its mouth, my honest Nab!" replied Herbert, "but you<br/>are not afraid that it will shut upon us, are you?"<br/><br/>"No, Mr. Herbert," answered Neb, "and yet this gulf here doesn't<br/>please me much! It has a wicked look!"<br/><br/>"Hallo!" cried Pencroft, "here is Neb turning up his nose at my<br/>gulf, just as I was thinking of presenting it to America!"<br/><br/>"But, at any rate, is the water deep enough?" asked the<br/>engineer, "for a depth sufficient for the keel of the<br/>'Bonadventure' would not be enough for those of our<br/>iron-clads."<br/><br/>"That is easily found out," replied Pencroft.<br/><br/>And the sailor sounded with a long cord, which served him as a<br/>lead-line, and to which was fastened a lump of iron. This cord<br/>measured nearly fifty fathoms, and its entire length was unrolled<br/>without finding any bottom.<br/>
