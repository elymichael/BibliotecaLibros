"A castaway!" exclaimed Pencroft; "left on this Tabor Island not
two hundred miles from us! Ah, Captain Harding, you won't now
oppose my going."

"No, Pencroft," replied Cyrus Harding; "and you shall set out as
soon as possible."

"To-morrow?"

"To-morrow!"

The engineer still held in his hand the paper which he had taken
from the bottle. He contemplated it for some instants, then
resumed,

"From this document, my friends, from the way in which it is
worded, we may conclude this: first, that the castaway on Tabor
Island is a man possessing a considerable knowledge of navigation,
since he gives the latitude and longitude of the island exactly as
we ourselves found it, and to a second of approximation; secondly,
that he is either English or American, as the document is written
in the English language."
