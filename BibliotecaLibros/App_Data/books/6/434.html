<br/>Certainly, it would have been safer to have taken a different<br/>road than that which led straight from the corral to Granite House,<br/>but the cart would have met with great difficulties in moving under<br/>the trees. It was necessary, therefore, to follow this way,<br/>although it was well known to the convicts.<br/><br/>Cyrus Harding and Gideon Spilett walked one on each side of the<br/>cart, ready to answer to any attack. However, it was not probable<br/>that the convicts would have yet left the plateau of Prospect<br/>Heights.<br/><br/>Neb's note had evidently been written and sent as soon as the<br/>convicts had shown themselves there. Now, this note was dated six<br/>o'clock in the morning, and the active orang, accustomed to come<br/>frequently to the corral, had taken scarcely three quarters of an<br/>hour to cross the five miles which separated it from Granite House.<br/>They would, therefore, be safe at that time, and if there was any<br/>occasion for firing, it would probably not be until they were in<br/>the neighborhood of Granite House. However, the colonists kept a<br/>strict watch. Top and Jup, the latter armed with his club,<br/>sometimes in front, sometimes beating the wood at the sides of the<br/>road, signalized no danger.<br/><br/>The cart advanced slowly under Pencroft's guidance. It had left<br/>the corral at half-past seven. An hour after, four out of the five<br/>miles had been cleared, without any incident having occurred. The<br/>road was as deserted as all that part of the Jacamar Wood which lay<br/>between the Mercy and the lake. There was no occasion for any<br/>warning. The wood appeared as deserted as on the day when the<br/>colonists first landed on the island.<br/><br/>They approached the plateau. Another mile and they would see the<br/>bridge over Creek Glycerine. Cyrus Harding expected to find it in<br/>its place; supposing that the convicts would have crossed it, and<br/>that, after having passed one of the streams which enclosed the<br/>plateau, they would have taken the precaution to lower it again, so<br/>as to keep open a retreat.<br/><br/>At length an opening in the trees allowed the sea-horizon to be<br/>seen. But the cart continued its progress, for not one of its<br/>defenders thought of abandoning it.<br/><br/>At that moment Pencroft stopped the onager, and in a hoarse<br/>voice,â€”<br/><br/>"Oh! the villains!" he exclaimed.<br/><br/>And he pointed to a thick smoke rising from the mill, the sheds,<br/>and the buildings at the poultry-yard.<br/><br/>A man was moving about in the midst of the smoke. It was<br/>Neb.<br/><br/>
