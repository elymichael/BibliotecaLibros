<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>5<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>Cyrus Harding and his companions slept like innocent marmots in<br/>the cave which the jaguar had so politely left at their<br/>disposal.<br/><br/>At sunrise all were on the shore at the extremity of the<br/>promontory, and their gaze was directed towards the horizon, of<br/>which two-thirds of the circumference were visible. For the last<br/>time the engineer could ascertain that not a sail nor the wreck of<br/>a ship was on the sea, and even with the telescope nothing<br/>suspicious could be discovered.<br/><br/>There was nothing either on the shore, at least, in the straight<br/>line of three miles which formed the south side of the promontory,<br/>for beyond that, rising ground had the rest of the coast, and even<br/>from the extremity of the Serpentine Peninsula Claw Cape could not<br/>be seen.<br/><br/>The southern coast of the island still remained to be explored.<br/>Now should they undertake it immediately, and devote this day to<br/>it?<br/><br/>This was not included in their first plan. In fact, when the<br/>boat was abandoned at the sources of the Mercy, it had been agreed<br/>that after having surveyed the west coast, they should go back to<br/>it, and return to Granite House by the Mercy. Harding then thought<br/>that the western coast would have offered refuge, either to a ship<br/>in distress, or to a vessel in her regular course; but now, as he<br/>saw that this coast presented no good anchorage, he wished to seek<br/>on the south what they had not been able to find on the west.<br/><br/>Gideon Spilett proposed to continue the exploration, that the<br/>question of the supposed wreck might be completely settled, and he<br/>asked at what distance Claw Cape might be from the extremity of the<br/>peninsula.<br/><br/>
