<br/>At the same time as the coal, the store of wood was renewed at<br/>Granite House, and they profited by the current of the Mercy having<br/>again become free, to float down several rafts. They could see that<br/>the cold period was not ended.<br/><br/>A visit was also paid to the Chimneys, and the settlers could<br/>not but congratulate themselves on not having been living there<br/>during the hurricane. The sea had left unquestionable traces of its<br/>ravages. Sweeping over the islet, it had furiously assailed the<br/>passages, half filling them with sand, while thick beds of seaweed<br/>covered the rocks. While Neb, Herbert, and Pencroft hunted or<br/>collected wood, Cyrus Harding and Gideon Spilett busied themselves<br/>in putting the Chimneys to rights, and they found the forge and the<br/>bellows almost unhurt, protected as they had been from the first by<br/>the heaps of sand.<br/><br/>The store of fuel had not been made uselessly. The settlers had<br/>not done with the rigorous cold. It is known that, in the Northern<br/>Hemisphere, the month of February is principally distinguished by<br/>rapid fallings of the temperature. It is the same in the Southern<br/>Hemisphere, and the end of the month of August, which is the<br/>February of North America, does not escape this climatic law.<br/><br/>About the 25th, after another change from snow to rain, the wind<br/>shifted to the southeast, and the cold became, suddenly, very<br/>severe. According to the engineer's calculation, the mercurial<br/>column of a Fahrenheit thermometer would not have marked less than<br/>eight degrees below zero, and this intense cold, rendered still<br/>more painful by a sharp gale, lasted for several days. The<br/>colonists were again shut up in Granite House, and as it was<br/>necessary to hermetically seal all the openings of the facade, only<br/>leaving a narrow passage for renewing the air, the consumption of<br/>candles was considerable. To economize them, the cavern was often<br/>only lighted by the blazing hearths, on which fuel was not spared.<br/>Several times, one or other of the settlers descended to the beach<br/>in the midst of ice which the waves heaped up at each tide, but<br/>they soon climbed up again to Granite House, and it was not without<br/>pain and difficulty that their hands could hold to the rounds of<br/>the ladder. In consequence of the intense cold, their fingers felt<br/>as if burned when they touched the rounds. To occupy the leisure<br/>hours, which the tenants of Granite House now had at their<br/>disposal, Cyrus Harding undertook an operation which could be<br/>performed indoors.<br/><br/>We know that the settlers had no other sugar at their disposal<br/>than the liquid substance which they drew from the maple, by making<br/>deep incisions in the tree. They contented themselves with<br/>collecting this liquor in jars and employing it in this state for<br/>different culinary purposes, and the more so, as on growing old,<br/>this liquid began to become white and to be of a syrupy<br/>consistence.<br/><br/>But there was something better to be made of it, and one day<br/>Cyrus Harding announced that they were going to turn into<br/>refiners.<br/><br/>"Refiners!" replied Pencroft. "That is rather a warm trade, I<br/>think."<br/><br/>"Very warm," answered the engineer.<br/><br/>"Then it will be seasonable!" said the sailor.<br/><br/>This word refining need not awake in the mind thoughts of an<br/>elaborate manufactory with apparatus and numerous workmen. No! to<br/>crystallize this liquor, only an extremely easy operation is<br/>required. Placed on the fire in large earthen pots, it was simply<br/>subjected to evaporation, and soon a scum arose to its surface. As<br/>soon as this began to thicken, Neb carefully removed it with a<br/>wooden spatula; this accelerated the evaporation, and at the same<br/>time prevented it from contracting an empyreumatic flavor.<br/><br/>
