<br/>"You have, four or five miles from here, a corral for your<br/>domesticated animals. These animals need to be taken care of. Will<br/>you allow me to live there with them?"<br/><br/>Cyrus Harding gazed at the unfortunate man for a few moments<br/>with a feeling of deep commiseration; then,â€”<br/><br/>"My friend," said he, "the corral has only stables hardly fit<br/>for animals."<br/><br/>"It will be good enough for me, sir."<br/><br/>"My friend," answered Harding, "we will not constrain you in<br/>anything. You wish to live at the corral, so be it. You will,<br/>however, be always welcome at Granite House. But since you wish to<br/>live at the corral we will make the necessary arrangements for your<br/>being comfortably established there."<br/><br/>"Never mind that, I shall do very well."<br/><br/>"My friend," answered Harding, who always intentionally made use<br/>of this cordial appellation, "you must let us judge what it will be<br/>best to do in this respect."<br/><br/>"Thank you, sir," replied the stranger as he withdrew.<br/><br/>The engineer then made known to his companions the proposal<br/>which had been made to him, and it was agreed that they should<br/>build a wooden house at the corral, which they would make as<br/>comfortable as possible.<br/><br/>That very day the colonists repaired to the corral with the<br/>necessary tools, and a week had not passed before the house was<br/>ready to receive its tenant. It was built about twenty feet from<br/>the sheds, and from there it was easy to overlook the flock of<br/>sheep, which then numbered more than eighty. Some furniture, a bed,<br/>table, bench, cupboard, and chest were manufactured, and a gun,<br/>ammunition, and tools were carried to the corral.<br/><br/>
