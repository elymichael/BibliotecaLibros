Cyrus Harding had provided himself with a straight stick, twelve<br/>feet long, which he had measured as exactly as possible by<br/>comparing it with his own height, which he knew to a hair. Herbert<br/>carried a plumb-line which Harding had given him, that is to say, a<br/>simple stone fastened to the end of a flexible fiber. Having<br/>reached a spot about twenty feet from the edge of the beach, and<br/>nearly five hundred feet from the cliff, which rose<br/>perpendicularly, Harding thrust the pole two feet into the sand,<br/>and wedging it up carefully, he managed, by means of the<br/>plumb-line, to erect it perpendicularly with the plane of the<br/>horizon.<br/><br/>That done, he retired the necessary distance, when, lying on the<br/>sand, his eye glanced at the same time at the top of the pole and<br/>the crest of the cliff. He carefully marked the place with a little<br/>stick.<br/><br/>Then addressing Herbertâ€”"Do you know the first principles of<br/>geometry?" he asked.<br/><br/>"Slightly, captain," replied Herbert, who did not wish to put<br/>himself forward.<br/><br/>"You remember what are the properties of two similar<br/>triangles?"<br/><br/>"Yes," replied Herbert; "their homologous sides are<br/>proportional."<br/><br/>"Well, my boy, I have just constructed two similar right-angled<br/>triangles; the first, the smallest, has for its sides the<br/>perpendicular pole, the distance which separates the little stick<br/>from the foot of the pole and my visual ray for hypothenuse; the<br/>second has for its sides the perpendicular cliff, the height of<br/>which we wish to measure, the distance which separates the little<br/>stick from the bottom of the cliff, and my visual ray also forms<br/>its hypothenuse, which proves to be prolongation of that of the<br/>first triangle."<br/><br/>"Ah, captain, I understand!" cried Herbert. "As the distance<br/>from the stick to the pole is to the distance from the stick to the<br/>base of the cliff, so is the height of the pole to the height of<br/>the cliff."<br/><br/>"Just so, Herbert," replied the engineer; "and when we have<br/>measured the two first distances, knowing the height of the pole,<br/>we shall only have a sum in proportion to do, which will give us<br/>the height of the cliff, and will save us the trouble of measuring<br/>it directly."<br/><br/>The two horizontal distances were found out by means of the<br/>pole, whose length above the sand was exactly ten feet.<br/><br/>The first distance was fifteen feet between the stick and the<br/>place where the pole was thrust into the sand.<br/>
