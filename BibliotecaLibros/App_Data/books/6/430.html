<br/>"It is that Ayrton was not killed at the corral! That they<br/>dragged him away living, since he has resisted. Therefore, perhaps,<br/>he is still living!"<br/><br/>"Perhaps, indeed," replied the engineer, who remained<br/>thoughtful.<br/><br/>This was a hope, to which Ayrton's companions could still hold.<br/>Indeed, they had before believed that, surprised in the corral,<br/>Ayrton had fallen by a bullet, as Herbert had fallen. But if the<br/>convicts had not killed him at first, if they had brought him<br/>living to another part of the island, might it not be admitted that<br/>he was still their prisoner? Perhaps, even, one of them had found<br/>in Ayrton his old Australian companion Ben Joyce, the chief of the<br/>escaped convicts. And who knows but that they had conceived the<br/>impossible hope of bringing back Ayrton to themselves? He would<br/>have been very useful to them, if they had been able to make him<br/>turn traitor!<br/><br/>This incident was, therefore, favorably interpreted at the<br/>corral, and it no longer appeared impossible that they should find<br/>Ayrton again. On his side, if he was only a prisoner, Ayrton would<br/>no doubt do all he could to escape from the hands of the villains,<br/>and this would be a powerful aid to the settlers!<br/><br/>"At any rate," observed Gideon Spilett, "if happily Ayrton did<br/>manage to escape, he would go directly to Granite House, for he<br/>could not know of the attempted assassination of which Herbert has<br/>been a victim, and consequently would never think of our being<br/>imprisoned in the corral."<br/><br/>"Oh! I wish that he was there, at Granite House!" cried<br/>Pencroft, "and that we were there, too! For, although the rascals<br/>can do nothing to our house, they may plunder the plateau, our<br/>plantations, our poultry-yard!"<br/><br/>Pencroft had become a thorough farmer, heartily attached to his<br/>crops. But it must be said that Herbert was more anxious than any<br/>to return to Granite House, for he knew how much the presence of<br/>the settlers was needed there. And it was he who was keeping them<br/>at the corral! Therefore, one idea occupied his mindâ€”to leave the<br/>corral, and when! He believed he could bear removal to Granite<br/>House. He was sure his strength would return more quickly in his<br/>room, with the air and sight of the sea!<br/><br/>Several times he pressed Gideon Spilett, but the latter,<br/>fearing, with good reason, that Herbert's wounds, half healed,<br/>might reopen on the way, did not give the order to start.<br/><br/>However, something occurred which compelled Cyrus Harding and<br/>his two friends to yield to the lad's wish, and God alone knew that<br/>this determination might cause them grief and remorse.<br/><br/>It was the 29th of November, seven o'clock in the evening. The<br/>three settlers were talking in Herbert's room, when they heard Top<br/>utter quick barks.<br/><br/>
