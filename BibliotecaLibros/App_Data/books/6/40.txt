"Two cables lengths at the most."

"But what is a cable's length?" asked Gideon Spilett.

"About a hundred and twenty fathoms, or six hundred feet."

"Then," said the reporter, "Cyrus Harding must have disappeared
twelve hundred feet at the most from the shore?"

"About that," replied Pencroft.

"And his dog also?"

"Also."

"What astonishes me," rejoined the reporter, "while admitting
that our companion has perished, is that Top has also met his
death, and that neither the body of the dog nor of his master has
been cast on the shore!"

"It is not astonishing, with such a heavy sea," replied the
sailor. "Besides, it is possible that currents have carried them
farther down the coast."

"Then, it is your opinion that our friend has perished in the
waves?" again asked the reporter.

"That is my opinion."
