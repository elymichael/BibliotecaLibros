"And can you guess, Pencroft," asked the reporter, "how it<br/>happened, or what can have occasioned the explosion?"<br/><br/>"Oh! Mr. Spilett, nothing is more simple," answered Pencroft. "A<br/>convict vessel is not disciplined like a man-of-war! Convicts are<br/>not sailors. Of course the powder-magazine was open, and as they<br/>were firing incessantly, some careless or clumsy fellow just blew<br/>up the vessel!"<br/><br/>"Captain Harding," said Herbert, "what astonishes me is that the<br/>explosion has not produced more effect. The report was not loud,<br/>and besides there are so few planks and timbers torn out. It seems<br/>as if the ship had rather foundered than blown up."<br/><br/>"Does that astonish you, my boy?" asked the engineer.<br/><br/>"Yes, captain."<br/><br/>"And it astonishes me also, Herbert," replied he, "but when we<br/>visit the hull of the brig, we shall no doubt find the explanation<br/>of the matter."<br/><br/>"Why, captain," said Pencroft, "you don't suppose that the<br/>'Speedy' simply foundered like a ship which has struck on a<br/>rock?"<br/><br/>"Why not," observed Neb, "if there are rocks in the<br/>channel?"<br/><br/>"Nonsense, Neb," answered Pencroft, "you did not look at the<br/>right moment. An instant before she sank, the brig, as I saw<br/>perfectly well, rose on an enormous wave, and fell back on her<br/>larboard side. Now, if she had only struck, she would have sunk<br/>quietly and gone to the bottom like an honest vessel."<br/><br/>"It was just because she was not an honest vessel!" returned<br/>Neb.<br/><br/>"Well, we shall soon see, Pencroft," said the engineer.<br/>
