<br/>"What's the matter?" asked the reporter.<br/><br/>"Look," replied Neb, with a shout of laughter. And what did they<br/>see? Master Jup smoking calmly and seriously, sitting crosslegged<br/>like a Turk at the entrance to Granite House!<br/><br/>"My pipe," cried Pencroft. "He has taken my pipe! Hello, my<br/>honest Jup, I make you a present of it! Smoke away, old boy, smoke<br/>away!"<br/><br/>And Jup gravely puffed out clouds of smoke which seemed to give<br/>him great satisfaction.

The building of the vessel advanced<br/>rapidly, she was already completely decked over, and all the inside<br/>parts of the hull were firmly united with ribs bent by means of<br/>steam, which answered all the purposes of a mold.<br/><br/>
