<br/>In the former case, they must have returned towards the corral,<br/>now without defenders, and which contained valuable stores.<br/><br/>In the latter, they must have regained their encampment, and<br/>would wait on opportunity to recommence the attack.<br/><br/>It was, therefore, possible to prevent them, but any enterprise<br/>to clear the island was now rendered difficult by reason of<br/>Herbert's condition. Indeed, their whole force would have been<br/>barely sufficient to cope with the convicts, and just now no one<br/>could leave Granite House.<br/><br/>The engineer and Neb arrived on the plateau. Desolation reigned<br/>everywhere. The fields had been trampled over; the ears of wheat,<br/>which were nearly full-grown, lay on the ground. The other<br/>plantations had not suffered less.<br/><br/>The kitchen-garden was destroyed. Happily, Granite House<br/>possessed a store of seed which would enable them to repair these<br/>misfortunes.<br/><br/>As to the wall and buildings of the poultry-yard and the onagers<br/>stable, the fire had destroyed all. A few terrified creatures<br/>roamed over the plateau. The birds, which during the fire had taken<br/>refuge on the waters of the lake, had already returned to their<br/>accustomed spot, and were dabbling on the banks. Everything would<br/>have to be reconstructed.<br/><br/>Cyrus Harding's face, which was paler than usual, expressed an<br/>internal anger which he commanded with difficulty, but he did not<br/>utter a word. Once more he looked at his devastated fields, and at<br/>the smoke which still rose from the ruins, then he returned to<br/>Granite House.<br/><br/>The following days were the saddest of any that the colonists<br/>had passed on the island! Herbert's weakness visibly increased. It<br/>appeared that a more serious malady, the consequence of the<br/>profound physiological disturbance he had gone through, threatened<br/>to declare itself, and Gideon Spilett feared such an aggravation of<br/>his condition that he would be powerless to fight against it!<br/><br/>In fact, Herbert remained in an almost continuous state of<br/>drowsiness, and symptoms of delirium began to manifest themselves.<br/>Refreshing drinks were the only remedies at the colonists'<br/>disposal. The fever was not as yet very high, but it soon appeared<br/>that it would probably recur at regular intervals. Gideon Spilett<br/>first recognized this on the 6th of December.<br/><br/>The poor boy, whose fingers, nose, and ears had become extremely<br/>pale, was at first seized with slight shiverings, horripilations,<br/>and tremblings. His pulse was weak and irregular, his skin dry, his<br/>thirst intense. To this soon succeeded a hot fit; his face became<br/>flushed; his skin reddened; his pulse quick; then a profuse<br/>perspiration broke out after which the fever seemed to diminish.<br/>The attack had lasted nearly five hours.<br/><br/>
