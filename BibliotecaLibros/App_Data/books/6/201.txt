"Back!" cried Pencroft. "Our guns are only loaded with small
shot, and beasts which can roar as loud as that would care no more
for it than for grains of salt!" And the sailor, seizing Herbert by
the arm, dragged him behind a rock, just as a magnificent animal
showed itself at the entrance of the cavern.

It was a jaguar of a size at least equal to its Asiatic
congeners, that is to say, it measured five feet from the extremity
of its head to the beginning of its tail. The yellow color of its
hair was relieved by streaks and regular oblong spots of black,
which contrasted with the white of its chest. Herbert recognized it
as the ferocious rival of the tiger, as formidable as the puma,
which is the rival of the largest wolf!

The jaguar advanced and gazed around him with blazing eyes, his
hair bristling as if this was not the first time he had scented
men.

At this moment the reporter appeared round a rock, and Herbert,
thinking that he had not seen the jaguar, was about to rush towards
him, when Gideon Spilett signed to him to remain where he was. This
was not his first tiger, and advancing to within ten feet of the
animal he remained motionless, his gun to his shoulder, without
moving a muscle. The jaguar collected itself for a spring, but at
that moment a shot struck it in the eyes, and it fell dead.

Herbert and Pencroft rushed towards the jaguar. Neb and Harding
also ran up, and they remained for some instants contemplating the
animal as it lay stretched on the ground, thinking that its
magnificent skin would be a great ornament to the hall at Granite
House.

"Oh, Mr. Spilett, how I admire and envy you!" cried Herbert, in
a fit of very natural enthusiasm.

"Well, my boy," replied the reporter, "you could have done the
same."

"I! with such coolness!â€”"

"Imagine to yourself, Herbert, that the jaguar is only a hare,
and you would fire as quietly as possible."

"That is," rejoined Pencroft, "that it is not more dangerous
than a hare!"
