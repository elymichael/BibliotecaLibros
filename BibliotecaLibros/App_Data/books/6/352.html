Nevertheless, the colonists were well prepared to meet the<br/>winter, however hard it might be. They had plenty of felt clothing,<br/>and the musmons, very numerous by this time, had furnished an<br/>abundance of wool necessary for the manufacture of this warm<br/>material.<br/><br/>It is unnecessary to say that Ayrton had been provided with this<br/>comfortable clothing. Cyrus Harding proposed that he should come to<br/>spend the bad season with them in Granite House, where he would be<br/>better lodged than at the corral, and Ayrton promised to do so, as<br/>soon as the last work at the corral was finished. He did this<br/>towards the middle of April. From that time Ayrton shared the<br/>common life, and made himself useful on all occasions; but still<br/>humble and sad, he never took part in the pleasures of his<br/>companions.<br/><br/>For the greater part of this, the third winter which the<br/>settlers passed in Lincoln Island, they were confined to Granite<br/>House. There were many violent storms and frightful tempests, which<br/>appeared to shake the rocks to their very foundations. Immense<br/>waves threatened to overwhelm the island, and certainly any vessel<br/>anchored near the shore would have been dashed to pieces. Twice,<br/>during one of these hurricanes, the Mercy swelled to such a degree<br/>as to give reason to fear that the bridges would be swept away, and<br/>it was necessary to strengthen those on the shore, which<br/>disappeared under the foaming waters, when the sea beat against the<br/>beach.<br/><br/>It may well be supposed that such storms, comparable to<br/>water-spouts in which were mingled rain and snow, would cause great<br/>havoc on the plateau of Prospect Heights. The mill and the<br/>poultry-yard particularly suffered. The colonists were often<br/>obliged to make immediate repairs, without which the safety of the<br/>birds would have been seriously threatened.<br/><br/>During the worst weather, several jaguars and troops of<br/>quadrumana ventured to the edge of the plateau, and it was always<br/>to be feared that the most active and audacious would, urged by<br/>hunger, manage to cross the stream, which besides, when frozen,<br/>offered them an easy passage. Plantations and domestic animals<br/>would then have been infallibly destroyed, without a constant<br/>watch, and it was often necessary to make use of the guns to keep<br/>those dangerous visitors at a respectful distance. Occupation was<br/>not wanting to the colonists, for without reckoning their out-door<br/>cares, they had always a thousand plans for the fitting up of<br/>Granite House.<br/><br/>They had also some fine sporting excursions, which were made<br/>during the frost in the vast Tadorn Marsh. Gideon Spilett and<br/>Herbert, aided by Jup and Top, did not miss a shot in the midst of<br/>myriads of wild-duck, snipe, teal, and others. The access to these<br/>hunting-grounds was easy; besides, whether they reached them by the<br/>road to Port Balloon, after having passed the Mercy Bridge, or by<br/>turning the rocks from Flotsam Point, the hunters were never<br/>distant from Granite House more than two or three miles.<br/><br/>Thus passed the four winter months, which were really rigorous,<br/>that is to say, June, July, August, and September. But, in short,<br/>Granite House did not suffer much from the inclemency of the<br/>weather, and it was the same with the corral, which, less exposed<br/>than the plateau, and sheltered partly by Mount Franklin, only<br/>received the remains of the hurricanes, already broken by the<br/>forests and the high rocks of the shore. The damages there were<br/>consequently of small importance, and the activity and skill of<br/>Ayrton promptly repaired them, when some time in October he<br/>returned to pass a few days in the corral.<br/><br/>During this winter, no fresh inexplicable incident occurred.<br/>Nothing strange happened, although Pencroft and Neb were on the<br/>watch for the most insignificant facts to which they attached any<br/>mysterious cause. Top and Jup themselves no longer growled round<br/>the well or gave any signs of uneasiness. It appeared, therefore,<br/>as if the series of supernatural incidents was interrupted,<br/>although they often talked of them during the evenings in Granite<br/>House, and they remained thoroughly resolved that the island should<br/>be searched, even in those parts the most difficult to explore. But<br/>an event of the highest importance, and of which the consequences<br/>might be terrible, momentarily diverted from their projects Cyrus<br/>Harding and his companions.<br/><br/>It was the month of October. The fine season was swiftly<br/>returning. Nature was reviving; and among the evergreen foliage of<br/>the coniferae which formed the border of the wood, already appeared<br/>the young leaves of the banksias, deodars, and other trees.<br/><br/>It may be remembered that Gideon Spilett and Herbert had, at<br/>different times, taken photographic views of Lincoln Island.<br/><br/>Now, on the 17th of this month of October, towards three o'clock<br/>in the afternoon, Herbert, enticed by the charms of the sky,<br/>thought of reproducing Union Bay, which was opposite to Prospect<br/>Heights, from Cape Mandible to Claw Cape.<br/>
