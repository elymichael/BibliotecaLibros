The stranding had taken place on the beach of Flotsam Point,
three miles from Granite House, and at high tide. It was therefore
probable that the cetacean would not be able to extricate itself
easily; at any rate it was best to hasten, so as to cut off its
retreat if necessary. They ran with pick-axes and iron-tipped poles
in their hands, passed over the Mercy bridge, descended the right
bank of the river, along the beach, and in less than twenty minutes
the settlers were close to the enormous animal, above which flocks
of birds already hovered.

"What a monster!" cried Neb.

And the exclamation was natural, for it was a southern whale,
eighty feet long, a giant of the species, probably not weighing
less than a hundred and fifty thousand pounds!

In the meanwhile, the monster thus stranded did not move, nor
attempt by struggling to regain the water while the tide was still
high.

It was dead, and a harpoon was sticking out of its left
side.

"There are whalers in these quarters, then?" said Gideon Spilett
directly.

"Oh, Mr. Spilett, that doesn't prove anything!" replied
Pencroft. "Whales have been known to go thousands of miles with a
harpoon in the side, and this one might even have been struck in
the north of the Atlantic and come to die in the south of the
Pacific, and it would be nothing astonishing."

Pencroft, having torn the harpoon from the animal's side, read
this inscription on it:

MARIA STELLA, VINEYARD

"A vessel from the Vineyard! A ship from my country!" he cried.
"The 'Maria Stella!' A fine whaler, 'pon my word; I know her well!
Oh, my friends, a vessel from the Vineyard!â€”a whaler from the
Vineyard!"
