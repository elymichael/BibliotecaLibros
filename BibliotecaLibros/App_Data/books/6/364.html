<br/>It was now half-past seven. The sun had disappeared twenty<br/>minutes ago behind Granite House. Consequently the Eastern horizon<br/>was becoming obscured. In the meanwhile the brig continued to<br/>advance towards Union Bay. She was now not more than two miles off,<br/>and exactly opposite the plateau of Prospect Heights, for after<br/>having tacked off Claw Cape, she had drifted towards the north in<br/>the current of the rising tide. One might have said that at this<br/>distance she had already entered the vast bay, for a straight line<br/>drawn from Claw Cape to Cape Mandible would have rested on her<br/>starboard quarter.<br/><br/>Was the brig about to penetrate far into the bay? That was the<br/>first question. When once in the bay, would she anchor there? That<br/>was the second. Would she not content herself with only surveying<br/>the coast, and stand out to sea again without landing her crew?<br/>They would know this in an hour. The colonists could do nothing but<br/>wait.<br/><br/>Cyrus Harding had not seen the suspected vessel hoist the black<br/>flag without deep anxiety. Was it not a direct menace against the<br/>work which he and his companions had till now conducted so<br/>successfully? Had these pirates—for the sailors of the brig could<br/>be nothing else—already visited the island, since on approaching it<br/>they had hoisted their colors. Had they formerly invaded it, so<br/>that certain unaccountable peculiarities might be explained in this<br/>way? Did there exist in the as yet unexplored parts some accomplice<br/>ready to enter into communication with them?<br/><br/>To all these questions which he mentally asked himself, Harding<br/>knew not what to reply; but he felt that the safety of the colony<br/>could not but be seriously threatened by the arrival of the<br/>brig.<br/><br/>However, he and his companions were determined to fight to the<br/>last gasp. It would have been very important to know if the pirates<br/>were numerous and better armed than the colonists. But how was this<br/>information to he obtained?<br/><br/>Night fell. The new moon had disappeared. Profound darkness<br/>enveloped the island and the sea. No light could pierce through the<br/>heavy piles of clouds on the horizon. The wind had died away<br/>completely with the twilight. Not a leaf rustled on the trees, not<br/>a ripple murmured on the shore. Nothing could be seen of the ship,<br/>all her lights being extinguished, and if she was still in sight of<br/>the island, her whereabouts could not be discovered.<br/><br/>"Well! who knows?" said Pencroft. "Perhaps that cursed craft<br/>will stand off during the night, and we shall see nothing of her at<br/>daybreak."<br/><br/>As if in reply to the sailor's observation, a bright light<br/>flashed in the darkness, and a cannon-shot was heard.<br/><br/>The vessel was still there and had guns on board.<br/><br/>Six seconds elapsed between the flash and the report.<br/><br/>
