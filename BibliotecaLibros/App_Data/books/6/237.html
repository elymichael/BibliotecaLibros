<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>9<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>The weather changed during the first week of March. There had<br/>been a full moon at the commencement of the month, and the heat was<br/>excessive. The atmosphere was felt to be full of electricity, and a<br/>period of some length of tempestuous weather was to be feared.<br/><br/>Indeed, on the 2nd, peals of thunder were heard, the wind blew<br/>from the east, and hail rattled against the facade of Granite House<br/>like volleys of grape-shot. The door and windows were immediately<br/>closed, or everything in the rooms would have been drenched. On<br/>seeing these hailstones, some of which were the size of a pigeon's<br/>egg, Pencroft's first thought was that his cornfield was in serious<br/>danger.<br/><br/>He directly rushed to his field, where little green heads were<br/>already appearing, and by means of a great cloth, he managed to<br/>protect his crop.<br/><br/>This bad weather lasted a week, during which time the thunder<br/>rolled without cessation in the depths of the sky.<br/><br/>The colonists, not having any pressing work out of doors,<br/>profited by the bad weather to work at the interior of Granite<br/>House, the arrangement of which was becoming more complete from day<br/>to day. The engineer made a turning-lathe, with which he turned<br/>several articles both for the toilet and the kitchen, particularly<br/>buttons, the want of which was greatly felt. A gunrack had been<br/>made for the firearms, which were kept with extreme care, and<br/>neither tables nor cupboards were left incomplete. They sawed, they<br/>planed, they filed, they turned; and during the whole of this bad<br/>season, nothing was heard but the grinding of tools or the humming<br/>of the turning-lathe which responded to the growling of the<br/>thunder.<br/><br/>Master Jup had not been forgotten, and he occupied a room at the<br/>back, near the storeroom, a sort of cabin with a cot always full of<br/>good litter, which perfectly suited his taste.<br/><br/>
