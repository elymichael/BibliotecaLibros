"Who knows?"

"And if you are caught in a hurricane?"

"There is no fear of that in the fine season," replied Pencroft.
"But, captain, as we must provide against everything, I shall ask
your permission to take Herbert only with me on this voyage."

"Pencroft," replied the engineer, placing his hand on the
sailor's shoulder, "if any misfortune happens to you, or to this
lad, whom chance has made our child, do you think we could ever
cease to blame ourselves?"

"Captain Harding," replied Pencroft, with unshaken confidence,
"we shall not cause you that sorrow. Besides, we will speak further
of this voyage, when the time comes to make it. And I fancy, when
you have seen our tight- rigged little craft, when you have
observed how she behaves at sea, when we sail round our island, for
we will do so togetherâ€”I fancy, I say, that you will no longer
hesitate to let me go. I don't conceal from you that your boat will
be a masterpiece."

"Say 'our' boat, at least, Pencroft," replied the engineer,
disarmed for the moment. The conversation ended thus, to be resumed
later on, without convincing either the sailor or the engineer.

The first snow fell towards the end of the month of June. The
corral had previously been largely supplied with stores, so that
daily visits to it were not requisite; but it was decided that more
than a week should never be allowed to pass without someone going
to it.

Traps were again set, and the machines manufactured by Harding
were tried. The bent whalebones, imprisoned in a case of ice, and
covered with a thick outer layer of fat, were placed on the border
of the forest at a spot where animals usually passed on their way
to the lake.

To the engineer's great satisfaction, this invention, copied
from the Aleutian fishermen, succeeded perfectly. A dozen foxes, a
few wild boars, and even a jaguar, were taken in this way, the
animals being found dead, their stomachs pierced by the unbent
bones.

An incident must here be related, not only as interesting in
itself, but because it was the first attempt made by the colonists
to communicate with the rest of mankind.
