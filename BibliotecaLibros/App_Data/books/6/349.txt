"No, Pencroft, but mysterious, most certainly," replied the
engineer; "unless you can explain that which Spilett and I have
until now failed to understand."

"Speak away, captain," answered the sailor.

"Well, have you understood," then said the engineer, "how was it
that after falling into the sea, I was found a quarter of a mile
into the interior of the island, and that, without my having any
consciousness of my removal there?"

"Unless, being unconscious—" said Pencroft.

"That is not admissible," replied the engineer. "But to
continue. Have you understood how Top was able to discover your
retreat five miles from the cave in which I was lying?"

"The dog's instinct—" observed Herbert.

"Singular instinct!" returned the reporter, "since
notwithstanding the storm of rain and wind which was raging during
that night, Top arrived at the Chimneys, dry and without a speck of
mud!"

"Let us continue," resumed the engineer. "Have you understood
how our dog was so strangely thrown up out of the water of the
lake, after his struggle with the dugong?"

"No! I confess, not at all," replied Pencroft, "and the wound
which the dugong had in its side, a wound which seemed to have been
made with a sharp instrument; that can't be understood,
either."

"Let us continue again," said Harding. "Have you understood, my
friends, how that bullet got into the body of the young peccary;
how that case happened to be so fortunately stranded, without there
being any trace of a wreck; how that bottle containing the document
presented itself so opportunely, during our first sea-excursion;
how our canoe, having broken its moorings, floated down the current
of the Mercy and rejoined us at the very moment we needed it; how
after the ape invasion the ladder was so obligingly thrown down
from Granite House; and lastly, how the document, which Ayrton
asserts was never written by him, fell into our hands?"
