<br/>The exploration was commenced at daybreak on the 19th of<br/>February, and lasted an entire week. The base of the mountain, with<br/>its spurs and their numberless ramifications, formed a labyrinth of<br/>valleys and elevations. It was evident that there, in the depths of<br/>these narrow gorges, perhaps even in the interior of Mount Franklin<br/>itself, was the proper place to pursue their researches. No part of<br/>the island could have been more suitable to conceal a dwelling<br/>whose occupant wished to remain unknown. But so irregular was the<br/>formation of the valleys that Cyrus Harding was obliged to conduct<br/>the exploration in a strictly methodical manner.<br/><br/>The colonists first visited the valley opening to the south of<br/>the volcano, and which first received the waters of Falls River.<br/>There Ayrton showed them the cavern where the convicts had taken<br/>refuge, and in which he had been imprisoned until his removal to<br/>the corral. This cavern was just as Ayrton had left it. They found<br/>there a considerable quantity of ammunition and provisions,<br/>conveyed thither by the convicts in order to form a reserve.<br/><br/>The whole of the valley bordering on the cave, shaded by fir and<br/>other trees, was thoroughly explored, and on turning the point of<br/>the southwestern spur, the colonists entered a narrower gorge<br/>similar to the picturesque columns of basalt on the coast. Here the<br/>trees were fewer. Stones took the place of grass. Goats and musmons<br/>gambolled among the rocks. Here began the barren part of the<br/>island. It could already be seen that, of the numerous valleys<br/>branching off at the base of Mount Franklin, three only were wooded<br/>and rich in pasturage like that of the corral, which bordered on<br/>the west on the Falls River valley, and on the east on the Red<br/>Creek valley. These two streams, which lower down became rivers by<br/>the absorption of several tributaries, were formed by all the<br/>springs of the mountain and thus caused the fertility of its<br/>southern part. As to the Mercy, it was more directly fed from ample<br/>springs concealed under the cover of Jacamar Wood, and it was by<br/>springs of this nature, spreading in a thousand streamlets, that<br/>the soil of the Serpentine Peninsula was watered.<br/><br/>Now, of these three well-watered valleys, either might have<br/>served as a retreat to some solitary who would have found there<br/>everything necessary for life. But the settlers had already<br/>explored them, and in no part had they discovered the presence of<br/>man.<br/><br/>Was it then in the depths of those barren gorges, in the midst<br/>of the piles of rock, in the rugged northern ravines, among the<br/>streams of lava, that this dwelling and its occupant would be<br/>found?<br/><br/>The northern part of Mount Franklin was at its base composed<br/>solely of two valleys, wide, not very deep, without any appearance<br/>of vegetation, strewn with masses of rock, paved with lava, and<br/>varied with great blocks of mineral. This region required a long<br/>and careful exploration. It contained a thousand cavities,<br/>comfortless no doubt, but perfectly concealed and difficult of<br/>access.<br/><br/>The colonists even visited dark tunnels, dating from the<br/>volcanic period, still black from the passage of the fire, and<br/>penetrated into the depths of the mountain. They traversed these<br/>somber galleries, waving lighted torches; they examined the<br/>smallest excavations; they sounded the shallowest depths, but all<br/>was dark and silent. It did not appear that the foot of man had<br/>ever before trodden these ancient passages, or that his arm had<br/>ever displaced one of these blocks, which remained as the volcano<br/>had cast them up above the waters, at the time of the submersion of<br/>the island.<br/><br/>However, although these passages appeared to be absolutely<br/>deserted, and the obscurity was complete, Cyrus Harding was obliged<br/>to confess that absolute silence did not reign there.<br/><br/>On arriving at the end of one of these gloomy caverns, extending<br/>several hundred feet into the interior of the mountain, he was<br/>surprised to hear a deep rumbling noise, increased in intensity by<br/>the sonorousness of the rocks.<br/><br/>Gideon Spilett, who accompanied him, also heard these distant<br/>mutterings, which indicated a revivification of the subterranean<br/>fires. Several times both listened, and they agreed that some<br/>chemical process was taking place in the bowels of the earth.<br/><br/>
