The boat slowly approached it, Cyrus Harding stood up in the
bows. He gazed, a prey to violent excitement. Then, all at once,
seizing the reporter's arm,—

"It is he! It can only be he!" he cried, "he!—"

Then, falling back on the seat, he murmured a name which Gideon
Spilett alone could hear.

The reporter evidently knew this name, for it had a wonderful
effect upon him, and he answered in a hoarse voice,—

"He! an outlawed man!"

"He!" said Harding.

At the engineer's command the boat approached this singular
floating apparatus. The boat touched the left side, from which
escaped a ray of light through a thick glass.

Harding and his companions mounted on the platform. An open
hatchway was there. All darted down the opening.

At the bottom of the ladder was a deck, lighted by electricity.
At the end of this deck was a door, which Harding opened.

A richly-ornamented room, quickly traversed by the colonists,
was joined to a library, over which a luminous ceiling shed a flood
of light.
