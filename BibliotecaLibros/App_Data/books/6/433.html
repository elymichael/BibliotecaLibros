"Let us go, then!" said he.<br/><br/>The question was quickly decided whether Herbert should be<br/>carried on a litter or in the cart which had brought Ayrton to the<br/>corral. The motion of the litter would have been more easy for the<br/>wounded lad, but it would have necessitated two bearers, that is to<br/>say, there would have been two guns less for defense if an attack<br/>was made on the road. Would they not, on the contrary, by employing<br/>the cart leave every arm free? Was it impossible to place the<br/>mattress on which Herbert was lying in it, and to advance with so<br/>much care that any jolt should be avoided? It could be done.<br/><br/>The cart was brought. Pencroft harnessed the onager. Cyrus<br/>Harding and the reporter raised Herbert's mattress and placed it on<br/>the bottom of the cart. The weather was fine. The sun's bright rays<br/>glanced through the trees.<br/><br/>"Are the guns ready?" asked Cyrus Harding.<br/><br/>They were. The engineer and Pencroft, each armed with a<br/>double-barreled gun, and Gideon Spilett carrying his rifle, had<br/>nothing to do but start.<br/><br/>"Are you comfortable, Herbert?" asked the engineer.<br/><br/>"Ah, captain," replied the lad, "don't be uneasy, I shall not<br/>die on the road!"<br/><br/>While speaking thus, it could be seen that the poor boy had<br/>called up all his energy, and by the energy of a powerful will had<br/>collected his failing strength.<br/><br/>The engineer felt his heart sink painfully. He still hesitated<br/>to give the signal for departure; but that would have driven<br/>Herbert to despairâ€”killed him perhaps.<br/><br/>"Forward!" said Harding.<br/><br/>The gate of the corral was opened. Jup and Top, who knew when to<br/>be silent, ran in advance. The cart came out, the gate was<br/>reclosed, and the onager, led by Pencroft, advanced at a slow<br/>pace.<br/>
