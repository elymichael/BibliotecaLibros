<br/>"And a staircase to climb up to them!" added Neb.<br/><br/>"You are laughing," cried the sailor, "and why? What is there<br/>impossible in what I propose? Haven't we got pickaxes and spades?<br/>Won't Captain Harding be able to make powder to blow up the mine?<br/>Isn't it true, captain, that you will make powder the very day we<br/>want it?"<br/><br/>Cyrus Harding listened to the enthusiastic Pencroft developing<br/>his fanciful projects. To attack this mass of granite, even by a<br/>mine, was Herculean work, and it was really vexing that nature<br/>could not help them at their need. But the engineer did not reply<br/>to the sailor except by proposing to examine the cliff more<br/>attentively, from the mouth of the river to the angle which<br/>terminated it on the north.<br/><br/>They went out, therefore, and the exploration was made with<br/>extreme care, over an extent of nearly two miles. But in no place<br/>in the bare, straight cliff, could any cavity be found. The nests<br/>of the rock pigeons which fluttered at its summit were only, in<br/>reality, holes bored at the very top, and on the irregular edge of<br/>the granite.<br/><br/>It was a provoking circumstance, and as to attacking this cliff,<br/>either with pickaxe or with powder, so as to effect a sufficient<br/>excavation, it was not to be thought of. It so happened that, on<br/>all this part of the shore, Pencroft had discovered the only<br/>habitable shelter, that is to say, the Chimneys, which now had to<br/>be abandoned.<br/><br/>The exploration ended, the colonists found themselves at the<br/>north angle of the cliff, where it terminated in long slopes which<br/>died away on the shore. From this place, to its extreme limit in<br/>the west, it only formed a sort of declivity, a thick mass of<br/>stones, earth, and sand, bound together by plants, bushes, and<br/>grass inclined at an angle of only forty-five degrees. Clumps of<br/>trees grew on these slopes, which were also carpeted with thick<br/>grass. But the vegetation did not extend far, and a long, sandy<br/>plain, which began at the foot of these slopes, reached to the<br/>beach.<br/><br/>Cyrus Harding thought, not without reason, that the overplus of<br/>the lake must overflow on this side. The excess of water furnished<br/>by the Red Creek must also escape by some channel or other. Now the<br/>engineer had not yet found this channel on any part of the shore<br/>already explored, that is to say, from the mouth of the stream on<br/>the west of Prospect Heights.<br/><br/>The engineer now proposed to his companions to climb the slope,<br/>and to return to the Chimneys by the heights, while exploring the<br/>northern and eastern shores of the lake. The proposal was accepted,<br/>and in a few minutes Herbert and Neb were on the upper plateau.<br/>Cyrus Harding, Gideon Spilett, and Pencroft followed with more<br/>sedate steps.<br/><br/>The beautiful sheet of water glittered through the trees under<br/>the rays of the sun. In this direction the country was charming.<br/>The eye feasted on the groups of trees. Some old trunks, bent with<br/>age, showed black against the verdant grass which covered the<br/>ground. Crowds of brilliant cockatoos screamed among the branches,<br/>moving prisms, hopping from one bough to another.<br/><br/>The settlers instead of going directly to the north bank of the<br/>lake, made a circuit round the edge of the plateau, so as to join<br/>the mouth of the creek on its left bank. It was a detour of more<br/>than a mile and a half. Walking was easy, for the trees widely<br/>spread, left a considerable space between them. The fertile zone<br/>evidently stopped at this point, and vegetation would be less<br/>vigorous in the part between the course of the Creek and the<br/>Mercy.<br/><br/>
