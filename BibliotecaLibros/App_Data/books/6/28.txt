"God forbid!" replied the sailor. Their work was soon done, and
Pencroft declared himself very well satisfied.

"Now," said he, "our friends can come back when they like. They
will find a good enough shelter."

They now had only to make a fireplace and to prepare the
supper—an easy task. Large flat stones were placed on the ground at
the opening of the narrow passage which had been kept. This, if the
smoke did not take the heat out with it, would be enough to
maintain an equal temperature inside. Their wood was stowed away in
one of the rooms, and the sailor laid in the fireplace some logs
and brushwood. The seaman was busy with this, when Herbert asked
him if he had any matches.

"Certainly," replied Pencroft, "and I may say happily, for
without matches or tinder we should be in a fix."

"Still we might get fire as the savages do," replied Herbert,
"by rubbing two bits of dry stick one against the other."

"All right; try, my boy, and let's see if you can do anything
besides exercising your arms."

"Well, it's a very simple proceeding, and much used in the
islands of the Pacific."

"I don't deny it," replied Pencroft, "but the savages must know
how to do it or employ a peculiar wood, for more than once I have
tried to get fire in that way, but I could never manage it. I must
say I prefer matches. By the bye, where are my matches?"

Pencroft searched in his waistcoat for the box, which was always
there, for he was a confirmed smoker. He could not find it; he
rummaged the pockets of his trousers, but, to his horror, he could
nowhere discover the box.

"Here's a go!" said he, looking at Herbert. "The box must have
fallen out of my pocket and got lost! Surely, Herbert, you must
have something—a tinder-box—anything that can possibly make
fire!"

"No, I haven't, Pencroft."
