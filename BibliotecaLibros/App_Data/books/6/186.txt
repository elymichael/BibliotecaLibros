During the day the different articles were carried to Granite
House, where they were methodically arranged in the great hall.
This day—the 29th of October—happened to be a Sunday, and, before
going to bed, Herbert asked the engineer if he would not read them
something from the Gospel.

"Willingly," replied Cyrus Harding.

He took the sacred volume, and was about to open it, when
Pencroft stopped him, saying,—"Captain, I am superstitious. Open at
random and read the first verse which, your eye falls upon. We will
see if it applies to our situation."

Cyrus Harding smiled at the sailor's idea, and, yielding to his
wish, he opened exactly at a place where the leaves were separated
by a marker.

Immediately his eyes were attracted by a cross which, made with
a pencil, was placed against the eighth verse of the seventh
chapter of the Gospel of St. Matthew. He read the verse, which was
this:—

"For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh
findeth."
