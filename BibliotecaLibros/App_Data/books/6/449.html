<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>12<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>The next day, the 18th of February, was devoted to the<br/>exploration of all that wooded region forming the shore from<br/>Reptile End to Falls River. The colonists were able to search this<br/>forest thoroughly, for, as it was comprised between the two shores<br/>of the Serpentine Peninsula, it was only from three to four miles<br/>in breadth. The trees, both by their height and their thick<br/>foliage, bore witness to the vegetative power of the soil, more<br/>astonishing here than in any other part of the island. One might<br/>have said that a corner from the virgin forests of America or<br/>Africa had been transported into this temperate zone. This led them<br/>to conclude that the superb vegetation found a heat in this soil,<br/>damp in its upper layer, but warmed in the interior by volcanic<br/>fires, which could not belong to a temperate climate. The most<br/>frequently occurring trees were knaries and eucalypti of gigantic<br/>dimensions.<br/><br/>But the colonists' object was not simply to admire the<br/>magnificent vegetation. They knew already that in this respect<br/>Lincoln Island would have been worthy to take the first rank in the<br/>Canary group, to which the first name given was that of the Happy<br/>Isles. Now, alas! their island no longer belonged to them entirely;<br/>others had taken possession of it, miscreants polluted its shores,<br/>and they must be destroyed to the last man.<br/><br/>No traces were found on the western coast, although they were<br/>carefully sought for. No more footprints, no more broken branches,<br/>no more deserted camps.<br/><br/>"This does not surprise me," said Cyrus Harding to his<br/>companions. "The convicts first landed on the island in the<br/>neighborhood of Flotsam Point, and they immediately plunged into<br/>the Far West forests, after crossing Tadorn Marsh. They then<br/>followed almost the same route that we took on leaving Granite<br/>House. This explains the traces we found in the wood. But, arriving<br/>on the shore, the convicts saw at once that they would discover no<br/>suitable retreat there, and it was then that, going northwards<br/>again, they came upon the corral."<br/><br/>"Where they have perhaps returned," said Pencroft.<br/><br/>"I do not think so," answered the engineer, "for they would<br/>naturally suppose that our researches would be in that direction.<br/>The corral is only a storehouse to them, and not a definitive<br/>encampment."<br/><br/>
