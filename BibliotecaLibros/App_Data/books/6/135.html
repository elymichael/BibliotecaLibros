<br/>There the passage ended in a vast and magnificent cavern.<br/><br/>Top was running backwards and forwards, barking furiously.<br/>Pencroft and Neb, waving their torches, threw the light into every<br/>crevice; and at the same time, Harding, Gideon Spilett, and<br/>Herbert, their spears raised, were ready for any emergency which<br/>might arise. The enormous cavern was empty. The settlers explored<br/>it in every direction. There was nothing there, not an animal, not<br/>a human being; and yet Top continued to bark. Neither caresses nor<br/>threats could make him be silent.<br/><br/>"There must be a place somewhere, by which the waters of the<br/>lake reached the sea," said the engineer.<br/><br/>"Of course," replied Pencroft, "and we must take care not to<br/>tumble into a hole."<br/><br/>"Go, Top, go!" cried Harding.<br/><br/>The dog, excited by his master's words, ran towards the<br/>extremity of the cavern, and there redoubled his barking.<br/><br/>They followed him, and by the light of the torches, perceived<br/>the mouth of a regular well in the granite. It was by this that the<br/>water escaped; and this time it was not an oblique and practicable<br/>passage, but a perpendicular well, into which it was impossible to<br/>venture.<br/><br/>The torches were held over the opening: nothing could be seen.<br/>Harding took a lighted branch, and threw it into the abyss. The<br/>blazing resin, whose illuminating power increased still more by the<br/>rapidity of its fall, lighted up the interior of the well, but yet<br/>nothing appeared. The flame then went out with a slight hiss, which<br/>showed that it had reached the water, that is to say, the level of<br/>the sea.<br/><br/>The engineer, calculating the time employed in its fall, was<br/>able to calculate the depth of the well, which was found to be<br/>about ninety feet.<br/><br/>The floor of the cavern must thus be situated ninety feet above<br/>the level of the sea.<br/><br/>
