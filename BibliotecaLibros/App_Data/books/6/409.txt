At dawn of day, the 11th of November, Harding again sent the
electric current along the wire and received no reply.

He tried again: the same result.

"Off to the corral," said he.

"And well armed!" added Pencroft.

It was immediately decided that Granite House should not be left
alone and that Neb should remain there. After having accompanied
his friends to Creek Glycerine, he raised the bridge; and waiting
behind a tree he watched for the return of either his companions or
Ayrton.

In the event of the pirates presenting themselves and attempting
to force the passage, he was to endeavor to stop them by firing on
them, and as a last resource he was to take refuge in Granite
House, where, the lift once raised, he would be in safety.

Cyrus Harding, Gideon Spilett, Herbert, and Pencroft were to
repair to the corral, and if they did not find Ayrton, search the
neighboring woods.

At six o'clock in the morning, the engineer and his three
companions had passed Creek Glycerine, and Neb posted himself
behind a small mound crowned by several dragon trees, on the left
bank of the stream.

The colonists, after leaving the plateau of Prospect Heights,
immediately took the road to the corral. They shouldered their
guns, ready to fire on the slightest hostile demonstration. The two
rifles and the two guns had been loaded with ball.

The wood was thick on each side of the road and might easily
have concealed the convicts, who owing to their weapons would have
been really formidable.
