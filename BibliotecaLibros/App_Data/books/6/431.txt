Harding, Pencroft, and Spilett seized their guns and ran out of
the house. Top, at the foot of the palisade, was jumping, barking,
but it was with pleasure, not anger.

"Some one is coming."

"Yes."

"It is not an enemy!"

"Neb, perhaps?"

"Or Ayrton?"

These words had hardly been exchanged between the engineer and
his two companions when a body leaped over the palisade and fell on
the ground inside the corral.

It was Jup, Master Jup in person, to whom Top immediately gave a
most cordial reception.

"Jup!" exclaimed Pencroft.

"Neb has sent him to us," said the reporter.

"Then," replied the engineer, "he must have some note on
him."
