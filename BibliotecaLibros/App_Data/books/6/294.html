Indeed, on the morning of the 17th, the "Bonadventure" had been<br/>forty- eight hours at sea, and nothing showed that she was near the<br/>island. It was impossible, besides, to estimate the distance<br/>traversed, or to trust to the reckoning for the direction, as the<br/>speed had been very irregular.<br/><br/>Twenty-four hours after there was yet no land in sight. The wind<br/>was right ahead and the sea very heavy. The sails were<br/>close-reefed, and they tacked frequently. On the 18th, a wave swept<br/>completely over the "Bonadventure"; and if the crew had not taken<br/>the precaution of lashing themselves to the deck, they would have<br/>been carried away.<br/><br/>On this occasion Pencroft and his companions, who were occupied<br/>with loosing themselves, received unexpected aid from the prisoner,<br/>who emerged from the hatchway as if his sailor's instinct had<br/>suddenly returned, broke a piece out of the bulwarks with a spar so<br/>as to let the water which filled the deck escape. Then the vessel<br/>being clear, he descended to his cabin without having uttered a<br/>word. Pencroft, Gideon Spilett, and Herbert, greatly astonished,<br/>let him proceed.<br/><br/>Their situation was truly serious, and the sailor had reason to<br/>fear that he was lost on the wide sea without any possibility of<br/>recovering his course.<br/><br/>The night was dark and cold. However, about eleven o'clock, the<br/>wind fell, the sea went down, and the speed of the vessel, as she<br/>labored less, greatly increased.<br/><br/>Neither Pencroft, Spilett, nor Herbert thought of taking an<br/>hour's sleep. They kept a sharp look-out, for either Lincoln Island<br/>could not be far distant and would be sighted at daybreak, or the<br/>"Bonadventure," carried away by currents, had drifted so much that<br/>it would be impossible to rectify her course. Pencroft, uneasy to<br/>the last degree, yet did not despair, for he had a gallant heart,<br/>and grasping the tiller he anxiously endeavored to pierce the<br/>darkness which surrounded them.<br/><br/>About two o'clock in the morning he started forward,â€”<br/><br/>"A light! a light!" he shouted.<br/><br/>Indeed, a bright light appeared twenty miles to the northeast.<br/>Lincoln Island was there, and this fire, evidently lighted by Cyrus<br/>Harding, showed them the course to be followed. Pencroft, who was<br/>bearing too much to the north, altered his course and steered<br/>towards the fire, which burned brightly above the horizon like a<br/>star of the first magnitude.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
