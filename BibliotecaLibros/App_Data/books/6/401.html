<br/>"What danger shall we run," said Herbert, "if we take care to be<br/>always on our guard?"<br/><br/>"Hum!" observed the reporter, who had not given any decided<br/>opinion. "They are six and well armed. If they each lay hid in a<br/>corner, and each fired at one of us, they would soon be masters of<br/>the colony!"<br/><br/>"Why have they not done so?" said Herbert. "No doubt because it<br/>was not their interest to do it. Besides, we are six also."<br/><br/>"Well, well!" replied Pencroft, whom no reasoning could have<br/>convinced. "Let us leave these good people to do what they like,<br/>and don't think anything more about them!"<br/><br/>"Come, Pencroft," said Neb, "don't make yourself out so bad as<br/>all that! Suppose one of these unfortunate men were here before<br/>you, within good range of your guns, you would not fire."<br/><br/>"I would fire on him as I would on a mad dog, Neb," replied<br/>Pencroft coldly.<br/><br/>"Pencroft," said the engineer, "you have always shown much<br/>deference to my advice; will you, in this matter, yield to me?"<br/><br/>"I will do as you please, Captain Harding," answered the sailor,<br/>who was not at all convinced.<br/><br/>"Very well, wait, and we will not attack them unless we are<br/>attacked first."<br/><br/>Thus their behavior towards the pirates was agreed upon,<br/>although Pencroft augured nothing good from it. They were not to<br/>attack them, but were to be on their guard. After all, the island<br/>was large and fertile. If any sentiment of honesty yet remained in<br/>the bottom of their hearts, these wretches might perhaps be<br/>reclaimed. Was it not their interest in the situation in which they<br/>found themselves to begin a new life? At any rate, for humanity's<br/>sake alone, it would be right to wait. The colonists would no<br/>longer as before, be able to go and come without fear. Hitherto<br/>they had only wild beasts to guard against, and now six convicts of<br/>the worst description, perhaps, were roaming over their island. It<br/>was serious, certainly, and to less brave men, it would have been<br/>security lost! No matter! At present, the colonists had reason on<br/>their side against Pencroft. Would they be right in the future?<br/>That remained to be seen.<br/><br/>
