At eight o'clock Neb had not appeared, but there was no doubt<br/>that the frightful weather alone hindered his return, and that he<br/>must have taken refuge in some cave, to await the end of the storm<br/>or at least the return of day. As to going to meet him, or<br/>attempting to find him, it was impossible.<br/><br/>The game constituted the only dish at supper; the meat was<br/>excellent, and Pencroft and Herbert, whose long excursion had<br/>rendered them very hungry, devoured it with infinite<br/>satisfaction.<br/><br/>Their meal concluded, each retired to the corner in which he had<br/>rested the preceding night, and Herbert was not long in going to<br/>sleep near the sailor, who had stretched himself beside the<br/>fireplace.<br/><br/>Outside, as the night advanced, the tempest also increased in<br/>strength, until it was equal to that which had carried the<br/>prisoners from Richmond to this land in the Pacific. The tempests<br/>which are frequent during the seasons of the equinox, and which are<br/>so prolific in catastrophes, are above all terrible over this<br/>immense ocean, which opposes no obstacle to their fury. No<br/>description can give an idea of the terrific violence of the gale<br/>as it beat upon the unprotected coast.<br/><br/>Happily the pile of rocks which formed the Chimneys was solid.<br/>It was composed of enormous blocks of granite, a few of which,<br/>insecurely balanced, seemed to tremble on their foundations, and<br/>Pencroft could feel rapid quiverings under his head as it rested on<br/>the rock. But he repeated to himself, and rightly, that there was<br/>nothing to fear, and that their retreat would not give way. However<br/>he heard the noise of stones torn from the summit of the plateau by<br/>the wind, falling down on to the beach. A few even rolled on to the<br/>upper part of the Chimneys, or flew off in fragments when they were<br/>projected perpendicularly. Twice the sailor rose and intrenched<br/>himself at the opening of the passage, so as to take a look in<br/>safety at the outside. But there was nothing to be feared from<br/>these showers, which were not considerable, and he returned to his<br/>couch before the fireplace, where the embers glowed beneath the<br/>ashes.<br/><br/>Notwithstanding the fury of the hurricane, the uproar of the<br/>tempest, the thunder, and the tumult, Herbert slept profoundly.<br/>Sleep at last took possession of Pencroft, whom a seafaring life<br/>had habituated to anything. Gideon Spilett alone was kept awake by<br/>anxiety. He reproached himself with not having accompanied Neb. It<br/>was evident that he had not abandoned all hope. The presentiments<br/>which had troubled Herbert did not cease to agitate him also. His<br/>thoughts were concentrated on Neb. Why had Neb not returned? He<br/>tossed about on his sandy couch, scarcely giving a thought to the<br/>struggle of the elements. Now and then, his eyes, heavy with<br/>fatigue, closed for an instant, but some sudden thought reopened<br/>them almost immediately.<br/><br/>Meanwhile the night advanced, and it was perhaps two hours from<br/>morning, when Pencroft, then sound asleep, was vigorously<br/>shaken.<br/><br/>"What's the matter?" he cried, rousing himself, and collecting<br/>his ideas with the promptitude usual to seamen.<br/><br/>The reporter was leaning over him, and saying,â€”<br/><br/>"Listen, Pencroft, listen!"<br/><br/>The sailor strained his ears, but could hear no noise beyond<br/>those caused by the storm.<br/>
