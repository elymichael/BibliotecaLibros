<br/>"We must take refuge in Granite House while there is still time,<br/>and the convicts cannot see us."<br/><br/>"That is, my opinion, too," replied Gideon Spilett, "but once<br/>shut upâ€”"<br/><br/>"We must be guided by circumstances," said the engineer.<br/><br/>"Let us be off, then, and make haste!" said the reporter.<br/><br/>"Would you not wish, captain, that Ayrton and I should remain<br/>here?" asked the sailor.<br/><br/>"What would be the use of that, Pencroft?" replied Harding.

A bend of the cliff prevented them from being seen by<br/>those in the brig, but two or three reports, and the crash of<br/>bullets on the rock, told them that the "Speedy" was at no great<br/>distance.<br/><br/>To spring into the lift, hoist themselves up to the door of<br/>Granite House, where Top and Jup had been shut up since the evening<br/>before, to rush into the large room, was the work of a minute<br/>only.<br/><br/>It was quite time, for the settlers, through the branches, could<br/>see the "Speedy," surrounded with smoke, gliding up the channel.<br/>The firing was incessant, and shot from the four guns struck<br/>blindly, both on the Mercy post, although it was not occupied, and<br/>on the Chimneys. The rocks were splintered, and cheers accompanied<br/>each discharge.
