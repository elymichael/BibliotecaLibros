Then Cyrus Harding, extending his hand over the forehead of the
dead, said solemnly, "May his soul be with God!" Turning to his
friends, he added, "Let us pray for him whom we have lost!"

Some hours later the colonists fulfilled the promise made to the
captain by carrying out his dying wishes.

Cyrus Harding and his companions quitted the "Nautilus," taking
with them the only memento left them by their benefactor, the
coffer which contained wealth amounting to millions.

The marvelous saloon, still flooded with light, had been
carefully closed. The iron door leading on deck was then securely
fastened in such a manner as to prevent even a drop of water from
penetrating to the interior of the "Nautilus."

The colonists then descended into the canoe, which was moored to
the side of the submarine vessel.

The canoe was now brought around to the stern. There, at the
water-line, were two large stop-cocks communicating with the
reservoirs employed in the submersion of the vessel.

The stop-cocks were opened, the reservoirs filled, and the
"Nautilus," slowly sinking, disappeared beneath the surface of the
lake.

But the colonists were yet able to follow its descent through
the waves. The powerful light it gave forth lighted up the
translucent water, while the cavern became gradually obscure. At
length this vast effusion of electric light faded away, and soon
after the "Nautilus," now the tomb of Captain Nemo, reposed in its
ocean bed.
