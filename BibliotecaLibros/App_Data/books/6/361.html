So saying, Ayrton sat down in a corner of the room and remained<br/>silent. The colonists again discussed the strange ship, but Ayrton<br/>took no part in the conversation. All were in such a mood that they<br/>found it impossible to continue their work. Gideon Spilett and<br/>Pencroft were particularly nervous, going, coming, not able to<br/>remain still in one place. Herbert felt more curiosity. Neb alone<br/>maintained his usual calm manner. Was not his country that where<br/>his master was? As to the engineer, he remained plunged in deep<br/>thought, and in his heart feared rather than desired the arrival of<br/>the ship. In the meanwhile, the vessel was a little nearer the<br/>island. With the aid of the glass, it was ascertained that she was<br/>a brig, and not one of those Malay proas, which are generally used<br/>by the pirates of the Pacific. It was, therefore, reasonable to<br/>believe that the engineer's apprehensions would not be justified,<br/>and that the presence of this vessel in the vicinity of the island<br/>was fraught with no danger.<br/><br/>Pencroft, after a minute examination, was able positively to<br/>affirm that the vessel was rigged as a brig, and that she was<br/>standing obliquely towards the coast, on the starboard tack, under<br/>her topsails and top- gallant-sails. This was confirmed by Ayrton.<br/>But by continuing in this direction she must soon disappear behind<br/>Claw Cape, as the wind was from the southwest, and to watch her it<br/>would be then necessary to ascend the height of Washington Bay,<br/>near Port Balloon—a provoking circumstance, for it was already five<br/>o'clock in the evening, and the twilight would soon make any<br/>observation extremely difficult.<br/><br/>"What shall we do when night comes on?" asked Gideon Spilett.<br/>"Shall we light a fire, so as to signal our presence on the<br/>coast?"<br/><br/>This was a serious question, and yet, although the engineer<br/>still retained some of his presentiments, it was answered in the<br/>affirmative. During the night the ship might disappear and leave<br/>for ever, and, this ship gone, would another ever return to the<br/>waters of Lincoln Island? Who could foresee what the future would<br/>then have in store for the colonists?<br/><br/>"Yes," said the reporter, "we ought to make known to that<br/>vessel, whoever she may be, that the island is inhabited. To<br/>neglect the opportunity which is offered to us might be to create<br/>everlasting regrets."<br/><br/>It was therefore decided that Neb and Pencroft should go to Port<br/>Balloon, and that there, at nightfall, they should light an immense<br/>fire, the blaze of which would necessarily attract the attention of<br/>the brig.<br/><br/>But at the moment when Neb and the sailor were preparing to<br/>leave Granite House, the vessel suddenly altered her course, and<br/>stood directly for Union Bay. The brig was a good sailer, for she<br/>approached rapidly. Neb and Pencroft put off their departure,<br/>therefore, and the glass was put into Ayrton's hands, that he might<br/>ascertain for certain whether the ship was or was not the "Duncan."<br/>The Scotch yacht was also rigged as a brig. The question was,<br/>whether a chimney could be discerned between the two masts of the<br/>vessel, which was now at a distance of only five miles.<br/><br/>The horizon was still very clear. The examination was easy, and<br/>Ayrton soon let the glass fall again, saying—<br/><br/>"It is not the 'Duncan'! It could not be!"<br/><br/>Pencroft again brought the brig within the range of the<br/>telescope, and could see that she was of between three and four<br/>hundred tons burden, wonderfully narrow, well-masted, admirably<br/>built, and must be a very rapid sailer. But to what nation did she<br/>belong? That was difficult to say.<br/><br/>"And yet," added the sailor, "a flag is floating from her peak,<br/>but I cannot distinguish the colors of it."<br/>
