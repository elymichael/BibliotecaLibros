Cyrus Harding considered. He knew very little. The wave had torn<br/>him from the balloon net. He sank at first several fathoms. On<br/>returning to the surface, in the half light, he felt a living<br/>creature struggling near him. It was Top, who had sprung to his<br/>help. He saw nothing of the balloon, which, lightened both of his<br/>weight and that of the dog, had darted away like an arrow.<br/><br/>There he was, in the midst of the angry sea, at a distance which<br/>could not be less than half a mile from the shore. He attempted to<br/>struggle against the billows by swimming vigorously. Top held him<br/>up by his clothes; but a strong current seized him and drove him<br/>towards the north, and after half an hour of exertion, he sank,<br/>dragging Top with him into the depths. From that moment to the<br/>moment in which he recovered to find himself in the arms of his<br/>friends he remembered nothing.<br/><br/>"However," remarked Pencroft, "you must have been thrown on to<br/>the beach, and you must have had strength to walk here, since Neb<br/>found your footmarks!"<br/><br/>"Yes… of course replied the engineer, thoughtfully; "and you<br/>found no traces of human beings on this coast?"<br/><br/>"Not a trace," replied the reporter; "besides, if by chance you<br/>had met with some deliverer there, just in the nick of time, why<br/>should he have abandoned you after having saved you from the<br/>waves?"<br/><br/>"You are right, my dear Spilett. Tell me, Neb," added the<br/>engineer, turning to his servant, "it was not you who… you can't<br/>have had a moment of unconsciousness… during which no, that's<br/>absurd… . Do any of the footsteps still remain?" asked Harding.<br/><br/>"Yes, master, replied Neb; "here, at the entrance, at the back<br/>of the mound, in a place sheltered from the rain and wind. The<br/>storm has destroyed the others."<br/><br/>"Pencroft," said Cyrus Harding, "will you take my shoe and see<br/>if it fits exactly to the footprints?"<br/><br/>The sailor did as the engineer requested. While he and Herbert,<br/>guided by Neb, went to the place where the footprints were to be<br/>found, Cyrus remarked to the reporter,—<br/><br/>"It is a most extraordinary thing!"<br/><br/>"Perfectly inexplicable!" replied Gideon Spilett.<br/>
