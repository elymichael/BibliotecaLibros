"God forbid!" replied the sailor. Their work was soon done, and<br/>Pencroft declared himself very well satisfied.<br/><br/>"Now," said he, "our friends can come back when they like. They<br/>will find a good enough shelter."<br/><br/>They now had only to make a fireplace and to prepare the<br/>supper—an easy task. Large flat stones were placed on the ground at<br/>the opening of the narrow passage which had been kept. This, if the<br/>smoke did not take the heat out with it, would be enough to<br/>maintain an equal temperature inside. Their wood was stowed away in<br/>one of the rooms, and the sailor laid in the fireplace some logs<br/>and brushwood. The seaman was busy with this, when Herbert asked<br/>him if he had any matches.<br/><br/>"Certainly," replied Pencroft, "and I may say happily, for<br/>without matches or tinder we should be in a fix."<br/><br/>"Still we might get fire as the savages do," replied Herbert,<br/>"by rubbing two bits of dry stick one against the other."<br/><br/>"All right; try, my boy, and let's see if you can do anything<br/>besides exercising your arms."<br/><br/>"Well, it's a very simple proceeding, and much used in the<br/>islands of the Pacific."<br/><br/>"I don't deny it," replied Pencroft, "but the savages must know<br/>how to do it or employ a peculiar wood, for more than once I have<br/>tried to get fire in that way, but I could never manage it. I must<br/>say I prefer matches. By the bye, where are my matches?"<br/><br/>Pencroft searched in his waistcoat for the box, which was always<br/>there, for he was a confirmed smoker. He could not find it; he<br/>rummaged the pockets of his trousers, but, to his horror, he could<br/>nowhere discover the box.<br/><br/>"Here's a go!" said he, looking at Herbert. "The box must have<br/>fallen out of my pocket and got lost! Surely, Herbert, you must<br/>have something—a tinder-box—anything that can possibly make<br/>fire!"<br/><br/>"No, I haven't, Pencroft."<br/>
