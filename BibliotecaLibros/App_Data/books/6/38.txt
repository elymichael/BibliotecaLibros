The lad felt at this moment highly interested. He held his
breath, and Pencroft, his eyes staring, his mouth open, his lips
advanced, as if about to taste a piece of grouse, scarcely
breathed.

Meanwhile, the birds walked about the hooks, without taking any
notice of them. Pencroft then gave little tugs which moved the bait
as if the worms had been still alive.

The sailor undoubtedly felt much greater anxiety than does the
fisherman, for he does not see his prey coming through the water.
The jerks attracted the attention of the gallinaceae, and they
attacked the hooks with their beaks. Three voracious grouse
swallowed at the same moment bait and hook. Suddenly with a smart
jerk, Pencroft "struck" his line, and a flapping of wings showed
that the birds were taken.

"Hurrah!" he cried, rushing towards the game, of which he made
himself master in an instant.

Herbert clapped his hands. It was the first time that he had
ever seen birds taken with a line, but the sailor modestly
confessed that it was not his first attempt, and that besides he
could not claim the merit of invention.

"And at any rate," added he, "situated as we are, we must hope
to hit upon many other contrivances."

The grouse were fastened by their claws, and Pencroft, delighted
at not having to appear before their companions with empty hands,
and observing that the day had begun to decline, judged it best to
return to their dwelling.

The direction was indicated by the river, whose course they had
only to follow, and, towards six o'clock, tired enough with their
excursion, Herbert and Pencroft arrived at the Chimneys.
