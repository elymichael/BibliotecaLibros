So, then, the island was, or had been, inhabited by others than<br/>the settlers. Proved as it was by the incident of the bullet, it<br/>was hereafter an unquestionable fact, and such a discovery could<br/>not but cause great uneasiness among the colonists.<br/><br/>Cyrus Harding and Gideon Spilett, before sleeping, conversed<br/>long about the matter. They asked themselves if by chance this<br/>incident might not have some connection with the inexplicable way<br/>in which the engineer had been saved, and the other peculiar<br/>circumstances which had struck them at different times. However,<br/>Cyrus Harding, after having discussed the pros and cons of the<br/>question, ended by saying,—<br/><br/>"In short, would you like to know my opinion, my dear<br/>Spilett?"<br/><br/>"Yes, Cyrus."<br/><br/>"Well, then, it is this: however minutely we explore the island,<br/>we shall find nothing."<br/><br/>The next day Pencroft set to work. He did not mean to build a<br/>boat with boards and planking, but simply a flat-bottomed canoe,<br/>which would be well suited for navigating the Mercy—above all, for<br/>approaching its source, where the water would naturally be shallow.<br/>Pieces of bark, fastened one to the other, would form a light boat;<br/>and in case of natural obstacles, which would render a portage<br/>necessary, it would be easily carried. Pencroft intended to secure<br/>the pieces of bark by means of nails, to insure the canoe being<br/>water-tight.<br/><br/>It was first necessary to select the trees which would afford a<br/>strong and supple bark for the work. Now the last storm had brought<br/>down a number of large birch-trees, the bark of which would be<br/>perfectly suited for their purpose. Some of these trees lay on the<br/>ground, and they had only to be barked, which was the most<br/>difficult thing of all, owing to the imperfect tools which the<br/>settlers possessed. However, they overcame all difficulties.<br/><br/>While the sailor, seconded by the engineer, thus occupied<br/>himself without losing an hour, Gideon Spilett and Herbert were not<br/>idle.<br/><br/>They were made purveyors to the colony. The reporter could not<br/>but admire the boy, who had acquired great skill in handling the<br/>bow and spear. Herbert also showed great courage and much of that<br/>presence of mind which may justly be called "the reasoning of<br/>bravery." These two companions of the chase, remembering Cyrus<br/>Harding's recommendations, did not go beyond a radius of two miles<br/>round Granite House; but the borders of the forest furnished a<br/>sufficient tribute of agoutis, capybaras, kangaroos, peccaries,<br/>etc.; and if the result from the traps was less than during the<br/>cold, still the warren yielded its accustomed quota, which might<br/>have fed all the colony in Lincoln Island.<br/><br/>Often during these excursions, Herbert talked with Gideon<br/>Spilett on the incident of the bullet, and the deductions which the<br/>engineer drew from it, and one day—it was the 26th of October—he<br/>said—"But, Mr. Spilett, do you not think it very extraordinary<br/>that, if any castaways have landed on the island, they have not yet<br/>shown themselves near Granite House?"<br/><br/>"Very astonishing if they are still here," replied the reporter,<br/>"but not astonishing at all if they are here no longer!"<br/>
