It can, therefore, be well understood how injurious this
seclusion in the corral must have been to the colonists.

But if they were compelled to bow before necessity, they did not
do so without impatience.

Once or twice the reporter ventured out into the road and made
the tour of the palisade. Top accompanied him, and Gideon Spilett,
his gun cocked, was ready for any emergency.

He met with no misadventure and found no suspicious traces. His
dog would have warned him of any danger, and, as Top did not bark,
it might be concluded that there was nothing to fear at the moment
at least, and that the convicts were occupied in another part of
the island.

However, on his second sortie, on the 27th of November, Gideon
Spilett, who had ventured a quarter of a mile into the woods,
towards the south of the mountain, remarked that Top scented
something. The dog had no longer his unconcerned manner; he went
backwards and forwards, ferreting among the grass and bushes as if
his smell had revealed some suspicious object to him.

Gideon Spilett followed Top, encouraged him, excited him by his
voice, while keeping a sharp look-out, his gun ready to fire, and
sheltering himself behind the trees. It was not probable that Top
scented the presence of man, for in that case, he would have
announced it by half-uttered, sullen, angry barks. Now, as he did
not growl, it was because danger was neither near nor
approaching.

Nearly five minutes passed thus, Top rummaging, the reporter
following him prudently when, all at once, the dog rushed towards a
thick bush, and drew out a rag.

It was a piece of cloth, stained and torn, which Spilett
immediately brought back to the corral. There it was examined by
the colonists, who found that it was a fragment of Ayrton's
waistcoat, a piece of that felt, manufactured solely by the Granite
House factory.

"You see, Pencroft," observed Harding, "there has been
resistance on the part of the unfortunate Ayrton. The convicts have
dragged him away in spite of himself! Do you still doubt his
honesty?"

"No, captain," answered the sailor, "and I repented of my
suspicion a long time ago! But it seems to me that something may be
learned from the incident."

"What is that?" asked the reporter.
