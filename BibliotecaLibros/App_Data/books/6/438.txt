In the former case, they must have returned towards the corral,
now without defenders, and which contained valuable stores.

In the latter, they must have regained their encampment, and
would wait on opportunity to recommence the attack.

It was, therefore, possible to prevent them, but any enterprise
to clear the island was now rendered difficult by reason of
Herbert's condition. Indeed, their whole force would have been
barely sufficient to cope with the convicts, and just now no one
could leave Granite House.

The engineer and Neb arrived on the plateau. Desolation reigned
everywhere. The fields had been trampled over; the ears of wheat,
which were nearly full-grown, lay on the ground. The other
plantations had not suffered less.

The kitchen-garden was destroyed. Happily, Granite House
possessed a store of seed which would enable them to repair these
misfortunes.

As to the wall and buildings of the poultry-yard and the onagers
stable, the fire had destroyed all. A few terrified creatures
roamed over the plateau. The birds, which during the fire had taken
refuge on the waters of the lake, had already returned to their
accustomed spot, and were dabbling on the banks. Everything would
have to be reconstructed.

Cyrus Harding's face, which was paler than usual, expressed an
internal anger which he commanded with difficulty, but he did not
utter a word. Once more he looked at his devastated fields, and at
the smoke which still rose from the ruins, then he returned to
Granite House.

The following days were the saddest of any that the colonists
had passed on the island! Herbert's weakness visibly increased. It
appeared that a more serious malady, the consequence of the
profound physiological disturbance he had gone through, threatened
to declare itself, and Gideon Spilett feared such an aggravation of
his condition that he would be powerless to fight against it!

In fact, Herbert remained in an almost continuous state of
drowsiness, and symptoms of delirium began to manifest themselves.
Refreshing drinks were the only remedies at the colonists'
disposal. The fever was not as yet very high, but it soon appeared
that it would probably recur at regular intervals. Gideon Spilett
first recognized this on the 6th of December.

The poor boy, whose fingers, nose, and ears had become extremely
pale, was at first seized with slight shiverings, horripilations,
and tremblings. His pulse was weak and irregular, his skin dry, his
thirst intense. To this soon succeeded a hot fit; his face became
flushed; his skin reddened; his pulse quick; then a profuse
perspiration broke out after which the fever seemed to diminish.
The attack had lasted nearly five hours.
