<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>15<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>The next day, the 20th of October, at seven o'clock in the<br/>morning, after a voyage of four days, the "Bonadventure" gently<br/>glided up to the beach at the mouth of the Mercy.<br/><br/>Cyrus Harding and Neb, who had become very uneasy at the bad<br/>weather and the prolonged absence of their companions, had climbed<br/>at daybreak to the plateau of Prospect Heights, and they had at<br/>last caught sight of the vessel which had been so long in<br/>returning.<br/><br/>"God be praised! there they are!" exclaimed Cyrus Harding.<br/><br/>As to Neb in his joy, he began to dance, to twirl round,<br/>clapping his hands and shouting, "Oh! my master!" A more touching<br/>pantomime than the finest discourse.<br/><br/>The engineer's first idea, on counting the people on the deck of<br/>the "Bonadventure," was that Pencroft had not found the castaway of<br/>Tabor Island, or at any rate that the unfortunate man had refused<br/>to leave his island and change one prison for another.<br/><br/>Indeed Pencroft, Gideon Spilett, and Herbert were alone on the<br/>deck of the "Bonadventure."<br/><br/>
