<br/>"My own opinion," said Gideon Spilett, "with due deference to<br/>your experience, Pencroft, is that in the double fact of the<br/>absolute disappearance of Cyrus and Top, living or dead, there is<br/>something unaccountable and unlikely."<br/><br/>"I wish I could think like you, Mr. Spilett," replied Pencroft;<br/>"unhappily, my mind is made up on this point." Having said this,<br/>the sailor returned to the Chimneys. A good fire crackled on the<br/>hearth. Herbert had just thrown on an armful of dry wood, and the<br/>flame cast a bright light into the darkest parts of the<br/>passage.<br/><br/>Pencroft immediately began to prepare the dinner. It appeared<br/>best to introduce something solid into the bill of fare, for all<br/>needed to get up their strength. The strings of couroucous were<br/>kept for the next day, but they plucked a couple of grouse, which<br/>were soon spitted on a stick, and roasting before a blazing<br/>fire.<br/><br/>At seven in the evening Neb had not returned. The prolonged<br/>absence of the Negro made Pencroft very uneasy. It was to be feared<br/>that he had met with an accident on this unknown land, or that the<br/>unhappy fellow had been driven to some act of despair. But Herbert<br/>drew very different conclusions from this absence. According to<br/>him, Neb's delay was caused by some new circumstances which had<br/>induced him to prolong his search. Also, everything new must be to<br/>the advantage of Cyrus Harding. Why had Neb not returned unless<br/>hope still detained him? Perhaps he had found some mark, a<br/>footstep, a trace which had put him in the right path. Perhaps he<br/>was at this moment on a certain track. Perhaps even he was near his<br/>master.<br/><br/>Thus the lad reasoned. Thus he spoke. His companions let him<br/>talk. The reporter alone approved with a gesture. But what Pencroft<br/>thought most probable was, that Neb had pushed his researches on<br/>the shore farther than the day before, and that he had not as yet<br/>had time to return.<br/><br/>Herbert, however, agitated by vague presentiments, several times<br/>manifested an intention to go to meet Neb. But Pencroft assured him<br/>that that would be a useless course, that in the darkness and<br/>deplorable weather he could not find any traces of Neb, and that it<br/>would be much better to wait. If Neb had not made his appearance by<br/>the next day, Pencroft would not hesitate to join him in his<br/>search.<br/><br/>Gideon Spilett approved of the sailor's opinion that it was best<br/>not to divide, and Herbert was obliged to give up his project; but<br/>two large tears fell from his eyes.<br/><br/>The reporter could not refrain from embracing the generous<br/>boy.<br/><br/>Bad weather now set in. A furious gale from the southeast passed<br/>over the coast. The sea roared as it beat over the reef. Heavy rain<br/>was dashed by the storm into particles like dust. Ragged masses of<br/>vapor drove along the beach, on which the tormented shingles<br/>sounded as if poured out in cart- loads, while the sand raised by<br/>the wind added as it were mineral dust to that which was liquid,<br/>and rendered the united attack insupportable. Between the river's<br/>mouth and the end of the cliff, eddies of wind whirled and gusts<br/>from this maelstrom lashed the water which ran through the narrow<br/>valley. The smoke from the fireplace was also driven back through<br/>the opening, filling the passages and rendering them<br/>uninhabitable.<br/><br/>Therefore, as the grouse were cooked, Pencroft let the fire die<br/>away, and only preserved a few embers buried under the ashes.<br/><br/>
