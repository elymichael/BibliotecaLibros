<br/>Cyrus Harding, after mature consideration, decided to<br/>manufacture a very simple battery, resembling as nearly as possible<br/>that invented by Becquerel in 1820, and in which zinc only is<br/>employed. The other substances, azotic acid and potash, were all at<br/>his disposal.<br/><br/>The way in which the battery was composed was as follows, and<br/>the results were to be attained by the reaction of acid and potash<br/>on each other. A number of glass bottles were made and filled with<br/>azotic acid. The engineer corked them by means of a stopper through<br/>which passed a glass tube, bored at its lower extremity, and<br/>intended to be plunged into the acid by means of a clay stopper<br/>secured by a rag. Into this tube, through its upper extremity, he<br/>poured a solution of potash, previously obtained by burning and<br/>reducing to ashes various plants, and in this way the acid and<br/>potash could act on each other through the clay.<br/><br/>Cyrus Harding then took two slips of zinc, one of which was<br/>plunged into azotic acid, the other into a solution of potash. A<br/>current was immediately produced, which was transmitted from the<br/>slip of zinc in the bottle to that in the tube, and the two slips<br/>having been connected by a metallic wire the slip in the tube<br/>became the positive pole, and that in the bottle the negative pole<br/>of the apparatus. Each bottle, therefore, produced as many currents<br/>as united would be sufficient to produce all the phenomena of the<br/>electric telegraph. Such was the ingenious and very simple<br/>apparatus constructed by Cyrus Harding, an apparatus which would<br/>allow them to establish a telegraphic communication between Granite<br/>House and the corral.<br/><br/>On the 6th of February was commenced the planting along the road<br/>to the corral, of posts furnished with glass insulators, and<br/>intended to support the wire. A few days after, the wire was<br/>extended, ready to produce the electric current at a rate of twenty<br/>thousand miles a second.<br/><br/>Two batteries had been manufactured, one for Granite House, the<br/>other for the corral; for if it was necessary the corral should be<br/>able to communicate with Granite House it might also be useful that<br/>Granite House should be able to communicate with the corral.<br/><br/>As to the receiver and manipulator, they were very simple. At<br/>the two stations the wire was wound round a magnet, that is to say,<br/>round a piece of soft iron surrounded with a wire. The<br/>communication was thus established between the two poles; the<br/>current, starting from the positive pole, traversed the wire,<br/>passed through the magnet which was temporarily magnetized, and<br/>returned through the earth to the negative pole. If the current was<br/>interrupted, the magnet immediately became unmagnetized. It was<br/>sufficient to place a plate of soft iron before the magnet, which,<br/>attracted during the passage of the current, would fall back when<br/>the current was interrupted. This movement of the plate thus<br/>obtained, Harding could easily fasten to it a needle arranged on a<br/>dial, bearing the letters of the alphabet, and in this way<br/>communicate from one station to the other.<br/><br/>All was completely arranged by the 12th of February. On this<br/>day, Harding, having sent the current through the wire, asked if<br/>all was going on well at the corral, and received in a few moments<br/>a satisfactory reply from Ayrton. Pencroft was wild with joy, and<br/>every morning and evening he sent a telegram to the corral, which<br/>always received an answer.<br/><br/>This mode of communication presented two very real advantages:<br/>firstly, because it enabled them to ascertain that Ayrton was at<br/>the corral; and secondly, that he was thus not left completely<br/>isolated. Besides, Cyrus Harding never allowed a week to pass<br/>without going to see him, and Ayrton came from time to time to<br/>Granite House, where he always found a cordial welcome.<br/><br/>The fine season passed away in the midst of the usual work. The<br/>resources of the colony, particularly in vegetables and corn,<br/>increased from day to day, and the plants brought from Tabor Island<br/>had succeeded perfectly.<br/><br/>The plateau of Prospect Heights presented an encouraging aspect.<br/>The fourth harvest had been admirable and it may be supposed that<br/>no one thought of counting whether the four hundred thousand<br/>millions of grains duly appeared in the crop. However, Pencroft had<br/>thought of doing so, but Cyrus Harding having told him that even if<br/>he managed to count three hundred grains a minute, or nine thousand<br/>an hour, it would take him nearly five thousand five-hundred years<br/>to finish his task, the honest sailor considered it best to give up<br/>the idea.<br/><br/>
