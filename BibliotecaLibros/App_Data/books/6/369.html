Ayrton and Pencroft, followed by their companions, descended to<br/>the beach. Ayrton undressed and rubbed himself with grease, so as<br/>to suffer less from the temperature of the water, which was still<br/>cold. He might, indeed, be obliged to remain in it for several<br/>hours.<br/><br/>Pencroft and Neb, during this time, had gone to fetch the boat,<br/>moored a few hundred feet higher up, on the bank of the Mercy, and<br/>by the time they returned, Ayrton was ready to start. A coat was<br/>thrown over his shoulders, and the settlers all came round him to<br/>press his hand.<br/><br/>Ayrton then shoved off with Pencroft in the boat.<br/><br/>It was half-past ten in the evening when the two adventurers<br/>disappeared in the darkness. Their companions returned to wait at<br/>the Chimneys.<br/><br/>The channel was easily traversed, and the boat touched the<br/>opposite shore of the islet. This was not done without precaution,<br/>for fear lest the pirates might be roaming about there. But after a<br/>careful survey, it was evident that the islet was deserted. Ayrton<br/>then, followed by Pencroft, crossed it with a rapid step, scaring<br/>the birds nestled in the holes of the rocks; then, without<br/>hesitating, he plunged into the sea, and swam noiselessly in the<br/>direction of the ship, in which a few lights had recently appeared,<br/>showing her exact situation. As to Pencroft, he crouched down in a<br/>cleft of the rock, and awaited the return of his companion.<br/><br/>In the meanwhile, Ayrton, swimming with a vigorous stroke,<br/>glided through the sheet of water without producing the slightest<br/>ripple. His head just emerged above it and his eyes were fixed on<br/>the dark hull of the brig, from which the lights were reflected in<br/>the water. He thought only of the duty which he had promised to<br/>accomplish, and nothing of the danger which he ran, not only on<br/>board the ship, but in the sea, often frequented by sharks. The<br/>current bore him along and he rapidly receded from the shore.<br/><br/>Half an hour afterwards, Ayrton, without having been either seen<br/>or heard, arrived at the ship and caught hold of the main-chains.<br/>He took breath, then, hoisting himself up, he managed to reach the<br/>extremity of the cutwater. There were drying several pairs of<br/>sailors' trousers. He put on a pair. Then settling himself firmly,<br/>he listened. They were not sleeping on board the brig. On the<br/>contrary, they were talking, singing, laughing. And these were the<br/>sentences, accompanied with oaths, which principally struck<br/>Ayrton:â€”<br/><br/>"Our brig is a famous acquisition."<br/><br/>"She sails well, and merits her name of the 'Speedy.'"<br/><br/>"She would show all the navy of Norfolk a clean pair of<br/>heels."<br/><br/>"Hurrah for her captain!"<br/>
