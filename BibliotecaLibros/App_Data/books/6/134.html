"Nearly a third," replied Harding, "for we have descended a<br/>hundred feet from the opening, and it is not impossible that a<br/>hundred feet farther downâ€”"<br/><br/>"Where is Top?" asked Neb, interrupting his master.<br/><br/>They searched the cavern, but the dog was not there.<br/><br/>"Most likely he has gone on," said Pencroft.<br/><br/>"Let us join him," replied Harding.<br/><br/>The descent was continued. The engineer carefully observed all<br/>the deviations of the passage, and notwithstanding so many detours,<br/>he could easily have given an account of its general direction,<br/>which went towards the sea.<br/><br/>The settlers had gone some fifty feet farther, when their<br/>attention was attracted by distant sounds which came up from the<br/>depths. They stopped and listened. These sounds, carried through<br/>the passage as through an acoustic tube, came clearly to the<br/>ear.<br/><br/>"That is Top barking!" cried Herbert.<br/><br/>"Yes," replied Pencroft, "and our brave dog is barking<br/>furiously!"<br/><br/>"We have our iron-tipped spears," said Cyrus Harding. "Keep on<br/>your guard, and forward!"<br/><br/>"It is becoming more and more interesting," murmured Gideon<br/>Spilett in the sailor's ear, who nodded. Harding and his companions<br/>rushed to the help of their dog. Top's barking became more and more<br/>perceptible, and it seemed strangely fierce. Was he engaged in a<br/>struggle with some animal whose retreat he had disturbed? Without<br/>thinking of the danger to which they might be exposed, the<br/>explorers were now impelled by an irresistible curiosity, and in a<br/>few minutes, sixteen feet lower they rejoined Top.<br/>
