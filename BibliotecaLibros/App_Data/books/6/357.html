"What is to be done?" asked the lad.<br/><br/>"Wait," replied Harding.<br/><br/>And for a considerable time the settlers remained silent, given<br/>up to all the thoughts, and the emotions, all the fears, all the<br/>hopes, which were aroused by this incident—the most important which<br/>had occurred since their arrival in Lincoln Island. Certainly, the<br/>colonists were not in the situation of castaways abandoned on a<br/>sterile islet, constantly contending against a cruel nature for<br/>their miserable existence, and incessantly tormented by the longing<br/>to return to inhabited countries. Pencroft and Neb, especially, who<br/>felt themselves at once so happy and so rich, would not have left<br/>their island without regret. They were accustomed, besides, to this<br/>new life in the midst of the domain which their intelligence had as<br/>it were civilized. But at any rate this ship brought news from the<br/>world, perhaps even from their native land. It was bringing<br/>fellow-creatures to them, and it may be conceived how deeply their<br/>hearts were moved at the sight!<br/><br/>From time to time Pencroft took the glass and rested himself at<br/>the window. From thence he very attentively examined the vessel,<br/>which was at a distance of twenty miles to the east. The colonists<br/>had as yet, therefore, no means of signalizing their presence. A<br/>flag would not have been perceived; a gun would not have been<br/>heard; a fire would not have been visible. However, it was certain<br/>that the island, overtopped by Mount Franklin, could not escape the<br/>notice of the vessel's lookout. But why was the ship coming there?<br/>Was it simple chance which brought it to that part of the Pacific,<br/>where the maps mentioned no land except Tabor Island, which itself<br/>was out of the route usually followed by vessels from the<br/>Polynesian Archipelagoes, from New Zealand, and from the American<br/>coast? To this question, which each one asked himself, a reply was<br/>suddenly made by Herbert.<br/><br/>"Can it be the 'Duncan'?" he cried.<br/><br/>The "Duncan," as has been said, was Lord Glenarvan's yacht,<br/>which had left Ayrton on the islet, and which was to return there<br/>someday to fetch him. Now, the islet was not so far distant from<br/>Lincoln Island, but that a vessel, standing for the one, could pass<br/>in sight of the other. A hundred and fifty miles only separated<br/>them in longitude, and seventy in latitude.<br/><br/>"We must tell Ayrton," said Gideon Spilett, "and send for him<br/>immediately. He alone can say if it is the 'Duncan.'"<br/><br/>This was the opinion of all, and the reporter, going to the<br/>telegraphic apparatus which placed the corral in communication with<br/>Granite House, sent this telegram:—"Come with all possible<br/>speed."<br/><br/>In a few minutes the bell sounded.<br/><br/>"I am coming," replied Ayrton.<br/><br/>Then the settlers continued to watch the vessel.<br/>
