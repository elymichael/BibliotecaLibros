In the meanwhile, considering the rapid current, Harding was led<br/>to suppose that he and his companions were much farther from the<br/>western coast than they had at first supposed. In fact, at this<br/>hour, the rising tide would have turned back the current of the<br/>creek, if its mouth had only been a few miles distant. Now, this<br/>effect was not produced, and the water pursued its natural course.<br/>The engineer was much astonished at this, and frequently consulted<br/>his compass, to assure himself that some turn of the river was not<br/>leading them again into the Far West.<br/><br/>However, the creek gradually widened and its waters became less<br/>tumultuous. The trees on the right bank were as close together as<br/>on the left bank, and it was impossible to distinguish anything<br/>beyond them; but these masses of wood were evidently uninhabited,<br/>for Top did not bark, and the intelligent animal would not have<br/>failed to signal the presence of any stranger in the<br/>neighborhood.<br/><br/>At half-past ten, to the great surprise of Cyrus Harding,<br/>Herbert, who was a little in front, suddenly stopped and<br/>exclaimed,â€”<br/><br/>"The sea!"<br/><br/>In a few minutes more, the whole western shore of the island lay<br/>extended before the eyes of the settlers.<br/><br/>But what a contrast between this and the eastern coast, upon<br/>which chance had first thrown them. No granite cliff, no rocks, not<br/>even a sandy beach. The forest reached the shore, and the tall<br/>trees bending over the water were beaten by the waves. It was not<br/>such a shore as is usually formed by nature, either by extending a<br/>vast carpet of sand, or by grouping masses of rock, but a beautiful<br/>border consisting of the most splendid trees. The bank was raised a<br/>little above the level of the sea, and on this luxuriant soil,<br/>supported by a granite base, the fine forest trees seemed to be as<br/>firmly planted as in the interior of the island.<br/><br/>The colonists were then on the shore of an unimportant little<br/>harbor, which would scarcely have contained even two or three<br/>fishing-boats. It served as a neck to the new creek, of which the<br/>curious thing was that its waters, instead of joining the sea by a<br/>gentle slope, fell from a height of more than forty feet, which<br/>explained why the rising tide was not felt up the stream. In fact,<br/>the tides of the Pacific, even at their maximum elevation, could<br/>never reach the level of the river, and, doubtless, millions of<br/>years would pass before the water would have worn away the granite<br/>and hollowed a practicable mouth.<br/><br/>It was settled that the name of Falls River should be given to<br/>this stream. Beyond, towards the north, the forest border was<br/>prolonged for a space of nearly two miles; then the trees became<br/>scarcer, and beyond that again the picturesque heights described a<br/>nearly straight line, which ran north and south. On the contrary,<br/>all the part of the shore between Falls River and Reptile End was a<br/>mass of wood, magnificent trees, some straight, others bent, so<br/>that the long sea-swell bathed their roots. Now, it was this coast,<br/>that is, all the Serpentine Peninsula, that was to be explored, for<br/>this part of the shore offered a refuge to castaways, which the<br/>other wild and barren side must have refused.<br/><br/>The weather was fine and clear, and from a height of a hillock<br/>on which Neb and Pencroft had arranged breakfast, a wide view was<br/>obtained. There was, however, not a sail in sight; nothing could be<br/>seen along the shore as far as the eye could reach. But the<br/>engineer would take nothing for granted until he had explored the<br/>coast to the very extremity of the Serpentine Peninsula.<br/><br/>Breakfast was soon despatched, and at half-past eleven the<br/>captain gave the signal for departure. Instead of proceeding over<br/>the summit of a cliff or along a sandy beach, the settlers were<br/>obliged to remain under cover of the trees so that they might<br/>continue on the shore.<br/><br/>The distance which separated Falls River from Reptile End was<br/>about twelve miles. It would have taken the settlers four hours to<br/>do this, on a clear ground and without hurrying themselves; but as<br/>it was they needed double the time, for what with trees to go<br/>round, bushes to cut down, and creepers to chop away, they were<br/>impeded at every step, these obstacles greatly lengthening their<br/>journey.<br/>
