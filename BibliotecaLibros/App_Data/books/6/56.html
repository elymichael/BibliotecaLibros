<br/>"But do not dwell upon it just now, my dear Spilett, we will<br/>talk about it by-and-by."<br/><br/>A moment after the others entered.<br/><br/>There was no doubt about it. The engineer's shoe fitted exactly<br/>to the footmarks. It was therefore Cyrus Harding who had left them<br/>on the sand.<br/><br/>"Come," said he, "I must have experienced this unconsciousness<br/>which I attributed to Neb. I must have walked like a somnambulist,<br/>without any knowledge of my steps, and Top must have guided me<br/>here, after having dragged me from the wavesâ€¦ Come, Top! Come, old<br/>dog!"<br/><br/>The magnificent animal bounded barking to his master, and<br/>caresses were lavished on him. It was agreed that there was no<br/>other way of accounting for the rescue of Cyrus Harding, and that<br/>Top deserved all the honor of the affair.<br/><br/>Towards twelve o'clock, Pencroft having asked the engineer if<br/>they could now remove him, Harding, instead of replying, and by an<br/>effort which exhibited the most energetic will, got up. But he was<br/>obliged to lean on the sailor, or he would have fallen.<br/><br/>"Well done!" cried Pencroft; "bring the captain's litter."<br/><br/>The litter was brought; the transverse branches had been covered<br/>with leaves and long grass. Harding was laid on it, and Pencroft,<br/>having taken his place at one end and Neb at the other, they<br/>started towards the coast. There was a distance of eight miles to<br/>be accomplished; but, as they could not go fast, and it would<br/>perhaps be necessary to stop frequently, they reckoned that it<br/>would take at least six hours to reach the Chimneys. The wind was<br/>still strong, but fortunately it did not rain. Although lying down,<br/>the engineer, leaning on his elbow, observed the coast,<br/>particularly inland. He did not speak, but he gazed; and, no doubt,<br/>the appearance of the country, with its inequalities of ground, its<br/>forests, its various productions, were impressed on his mind.<br/>However, after traveling for two hours, fatigue overcame him, and<br/>he slept.<br/><br/>At half-past five the little band arrived at the precipice, and<br/>a short time after at the Chimneys.<br/><br/>They stopped, and the litter was placed on the sand; Cyrus<br/>Harding was sleeping profoundly, and did not awake.<br/><br/>
