<br/>The situation was evidently becoming very dangerous for Pencroft<br/>and Ayrton, and they saw that they must regain the mainland.<br/><br/>However, they waited till the first boat was within range, when<br/>two well- directed balls threw its crew into disorder. Then,<br/>Pencroft and Ayrton, abandoning their posts, under fire from the<br/>dozen muskets, ran across the islet at full speed, jumped into<br/>their boat, crossed the channel at the moment the second boat<br/>reached the southern end, and ran to hide themselves in the<br/>Chimneys.<br/><br/>They had scarcely rejoined Cyrus Harding and Herbert, before the<br/>islet was overrun with pirates in every direction. Almost at the<br/>same moment, fresh reports resounded from the Mercy station, to<br/>which the second boat was rapidly approaching. Two, out of the<br/>eight men who manned her, were mortally wounded by Gideon Spilett<br/>and Neb, and the boat herself, carried irresistibly onto the reefs,<br/>was stove in at the mouth of the Mercy. But the six survivors,<br/>holding their muskets above their heads to preserve them from<br/>contact with the water, managed to land on the right bank of the<br/>river. Then, finding they were exposed to the fire of the ambush<br/>there, they fled in the direction of Flotsam Point, out of range of<br/>the balls.<br/><br/>The actual situation was this: on the islet were a dozen<br/>convicts, of whom some were no doubt wounded, but who had still a<br/>boat at their disposal; on the island were six, but who could not<br/>by any possibility reach Granite House, as they could not cross the<br/>river, all the bridges being raised.<br/><br/>"Hallo," exclaimed Pencroft as he rushed into the Chimneys,<br/>"hallo, captain! What do you think of it, now?"<br/><br/>"I think," answered the engineer, "that the combat will now take<br/>a new form, for it cannot be supposed that the convicts will be so<br/>foolish as to remain in a position so unfavorable for them!"<br/><br/>"They won't cross the channel," said the sailor. "Ayrton and Mr.<br/>Spilett's rifles are there to prevent them. You know that they<br/>carry more than a mile!"<br/><br/>"No doubt," replied Herbert; "but what can two rifles do against<br/>the brig's guns?"<br/><br/>"Well, the brig isn't in the channel yet, I fancy!" said<br/>Pencroft.<br/><br/>"But suppose she does come there?" said Harding.<br/><br/>
