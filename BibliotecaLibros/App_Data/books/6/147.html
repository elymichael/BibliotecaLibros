<br/>They were now at the 4th of June. It was Whit Sunday and they<br/>agreed to observe this feast. All work was suspended, and prayers<br/>were offered to Heaven. But these prayers were now thanksgivings.<br/>The settlers in Lincoln Island were no longer the miserable<br/>castaways thrown on the islet. They asked for nothing moreâ€”they<br/>gave thanks. The next day, the 5th of June, in rather uncertain<br/>weather, they set out for the islet. They had to profit by the low<br/>tide to cross the Channel, and it was agreed that they would<br/>construct, for this purpose, as well as they could, a boat which<br/>would render communication so much easier, and would also permit<br/>them to ascend the Mercy, at the time of their grand exploration of<br/>the southwest of the island, which was put off till the first fine<br/>days.<br/><br/>The seals were numerous, and the hunters, armed with their<br/>iron-tipped spears, easily killed half-a-dozen. Neb and Pencroft<br/>skinned them, and only brought back to Granite House their fat and<br/>skin, this skin being intended for the manufacture of boots.<br/><br/>The result of the hunt was this: nearly three hundred pounds of<br/>fat, all to be employed in the fabrication of candles.<br/><br/>The operation was extremely simple, and if it did not yield<br/>absolutely perfect results, they were at least very useful. Cyrus<br/>Harding would only have had at his disposal sulphuric acid, but by<br/>heating this acid with the neutral fatty bodies he could separate<br/>the glycerine; then from this new combination, he easily separated<br/>the olein, the margarin, and the stearin, by employing boiling<br/>water. But to simplify the operation, he preferred to saponify the<br/>fat by means of lime. By this he obtained a calcareous soap, easy<br/>to decompose by sulphuric acid, which precipitated the lime into<br/>the state of sulphate, and liberated the fatty acids.<br/><br/>From these three acids-oleic, margaric, and stearic-the first,<br/>being liquid, was driven out by a sufficient pressure. As to the<br/>two others, they formed the very substance of which the candles<br/>were to be molded.<br/><br/>This operation did not last more than four and twenty hours. The<br/>wicks, after several trials, were made of vegetable fibers, and<br/>dipped in the liquefied substance, they formed regular stearic<br/>candles, molded by the hand, which only wanted whiteness and<br/>polish. They would not doubtless have the advantages of the wicks<br/>which are impregnated with boracic acid, and which vitrify as they<br/>burn and are entirely consumed, but Cyrus Harding having<br/>manufactured a beautiful pair of snuffers, these candles would be<br/>greatly appreciated during the long evenings in Granite House.<br/><br/>During this month there was no want of work in the interior of<br/>their new dwelling. The joiners had plenty to do. They improved<br/>their tools, which were very rough, and added others also.<br/><br/>Scissors were made among other things, and the settlers were at<br/>last able to cut their hair, and also to shave, or at least trim<br/>their beards. Herbert had none, Neb but little, but their<br/>companions were bristling in a way which justified the making of<br/>the said scissors.<br/><br/>The manufacture of a hand-saw cost infinite trouble, but at last<br/>an instrument was obtained which, when vigorously handled, could<br/>divide the ligneous fibers of the wood. They then made tables,<br/>seats, cupboards, to furnish the principal rooms, and bedsteads, of<br/>which all the bedding consisted of grass mattresses. The kitchen,<br/>with its shelves, on which rested the cooking utensils, its brick<br/>stove, looked very well, and Neb worked away there as earnestly as<br/>if he was in a chemist's laboratory.<br/><br/>But the joiners had soon to be replaced by carpenters. In fact,<br/>the waterfall created by the explosion rendered the construction of<br/>two bridges necessary, one on Prospect Heights, the other on the<br/>shore. Now the plateau and the shore were transversely divided by a<br/>watercourse, which had to be crossed to reach the northern part of<br/>the island. To avoid it the colonists had been obliged to make a<br/>considerable detour, by climbing up to the source of the Red Creek.<br/>The simplest thing was to establish on the plateau, and on the<br/>shore, two bridges from twenty to five and twenty feet in length.<br/>All the carpenter's work that was needed was to clear some trees of<br/>their branches: this was a business of some days. Directly the<br/>bridges were established, Neb and Pencroft profited by them to go<br/>to the oyster-bed which had been discovered near the downs. They<br/>dragged with them a sort of rough cart, which replaced the former<br/>inconvenient hurdle, and brought back some thousands of oysters,<br/>which soon increased among the rocks and formed a bed at the mouth<br/>of the Mercy. These molluscs were of excellent quality, and the<br/>colonists consumed some daily.<br/><br/>
