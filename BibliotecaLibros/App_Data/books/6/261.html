The ape and the dog were silent. Jup went off to bed, but Top<br/>remained in the room, and continued to utter low growls at<br/>intervals during the rest of the evening. There was no further talk<br/>on the subject, but the incident, however, clouded the brow of the<br/>engineer.<br/><br/>During the remainder of the month of July there was alternate<br/>rain and frost. The temperature was not so low as during the<br/>preceding winter, and its maximum did not exceed eight degrees<br/>Fahrenheit. But although this winter was less cold, it was more<br/>troubled by storms and squalls; the sea besides often endangered<br/>the safety of the Chimneys. At times it almost seemed as if an<br/>under-current raised these monstrous billows which thundered<br/>against the wall of Granite House.<br/><br/>When the settlers, leaning from their windows, gazed on the huge<br/>watery masses breaking beneath their eyes, they could not but<br/>admire the magnificent spectacle of the ocean in its impotent fury.<br/>The waves rebounded in dazzling foam, the beach entirely<br/>disapppearing under the raging flood, and the cliff appearing to<br/>emerge from the sea itself, the spray rising to a height of more<br/>than a hundred feet.<br/><br/>During these storms it was difficult and even dangerous to<br/>venture out, owing to the frequently falling trees; however, the<br/>colonists never allowed a week to pass without having paid a visit<br/>to the corral. Happily, this enclosure, sheltered by the<br/>southeastern spur of Mount Franklin, did not greatly suffer from<br/>the violence of the hurricanes, which spared its trees, sheds, and<br/>palisades; but the poultry-yard on Prospect Heights, being directly<br/>exposed to the gusts of wind from the east, suffered considerable<br/>damage. The pigeon-house was twice unroofed and the paling blown<br/>down. All this required to be remade more solidly than before, for,<br/>as may be clearly seen, Lincoln Island was situated in one of the<br/>most dangerous parts of the Pacific. It really appeared as if it<br/>formed the central point of vast cyclones, which beat it<br/>perpetually as the whip does the top, only here it was the top<br/>which was motionless and the whip which moved. During the first<br/>week of the month of August the weather became more moderate, and<br/>the atmosphere recovered the calm which it appeared to have lost<br/>forever. With the calm the cold again became intense, and the<br/>thermometer fell to eight degrees Fahrenheit, below zero.<br/><br/>On the 3rd of August an excursion which had been talked of for<br/>several days was made into the southeastern part of the island,<br/>towards Tadorn Marsh. The hunters were tempted by the aquatic game<br/>which took up their winter quarters there. Wild duck, snipe, teal<br/>and grebe abounded there, and it was agreed that a day should be<br/>devoted to an expedition against these birds.<br/><br/>Not only Gideon Spilett and Herbert, but Pencroft and Neb also<br/>took part in this excursion. Cyrus Harding alone, alleging some<br/>work as an excuse, did not join them, but remained at Granite<br/>House.<br/><br/>The hunters proceeded in the direction of Port Balloon, in order<br/>to reach the marsh, after having promised to be back by the<br/>evening. Top and Jup accompanied them. As soon as they had passed<br/>over the Mercy Bridge, the engineer raised it and returned,<br/>intending to put into execution a project for the performance of<br/>which he wished to be alone.<br/><br/>Now this project was to minutely explore the interior well, the<br/>mouth of which was on a level with the passage of Granite House,<br/>and which communicated with the sea, since it formerly supplied a<br/>way to the waters of the lake.<br/><br/>Why did Top so often run round this opening? Why did he utter<br/>such strange barks when a sort of uneasiness seemed to draw him<br/>towards this well? Why did Jup join Top in a sort of common<br/>anxiety? Had this well branches besides the communication with the<br/>sea? Did it spread towards other parts of the island? This is what<br/>Cyrus Harding wished to know. He had resolved, therefore, to<br/>attempt the exploration of the well during the absence of his<br/>companions, and an opportunity for doing so had now presented<br/>itself.<br/><br/>It was easy to descend to the bottom of the well by employing<br/>the rope ladder which had not been used since the establishment of<br/>the lift. The engineer drew the ladder to the hole, the diameter of<br/>which measured nearly six feet, and allowed it to unroll itself<br/>after having securely fastened its upper extremity. Then, having<br/>lighted a lantern, taken a revolver, and placed a cutlass in his<br/>belt, he began the descent.<br/><br/>The sides were everywhere entire; but points of rock jutted out<br/>here and there, and by means of these points it would have been<br/>quite possible for an active creature to climb to the mouth of the<br/>well.<br/>
