"That's impossible, for she would risk running aground and being<br/>lost!"<br/><br/>"It is possible," said Ayrton. "The convicts might profit by the<br/>high tide to enter the channel, with the risk of grounding at low<br/>tide, it is true; but then, under the fire from her guns, our posts<br/>would be no longer tenable."<br/><br/>"Confound them!" exclaimed Pencroft, "it really seems as if the<br/>blackguards were preparing to weigh anchor."<br/><br/>"Perhaps we shall be obliged to take refuge in Granite House!"<br/>observed Herbert.<br/><br/>"We must wait!" answered Cyrus Harding.<br/><br/>"But Mr. Spilett and Neb?" said Pencroft.<br/><br/>"They will know when it is best to rejoin us. Be ready, Ayrton.<br/>It is yours and Spilett's rifles which must speak now."<br/><br/>It was only too true. The "Speedy" was beginning to weigh her<br/>anchor, and her intention was evidently to approach the islet. The<br/>tide would be rising for an hour and a half, and the ebb current<br/>being already weakened, it would be easy for the brig to advance.<br/>But as to entering the channel, Pencroft, contrary to Ayrton's<br/>opinion, could not believe that she would dare to attempt it.<br/><br/>In the meanwhile, the pirates who occupied the islet had<br/>gradually advanced to the opposite shore, and were now only<br/>separated from the mainland by the channel.<br/><br/>Being armed with muskets alone, they could do no harm to the<br/>settlers, in ambush at the Chimneys and the mouth of the Mercy;<br/>but, not knowing the latter to be supplied with long-range rifles,<br/>they on their side did not believe themselves to be exposed. Quite<br/>uncovered, therefore, they surveyed the islet, and examined the<br/>shore.<br/><br/>Their illusion was of short duration. Ayrton's and Gideon<br/>Spilett's rifles then spoke, and no doubt imparted some very<br/>disagreeable intelligence to two of the convicts, for they fell<br/>backwards.<br/>
