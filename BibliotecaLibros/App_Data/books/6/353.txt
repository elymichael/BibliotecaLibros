The horizon was beautifully clear, and the sea, undulating under
a soft breeze, was as calm as the waters of a lake, sparkling here
and there under the sun's rays.

The apparatus had been placed at one of the windows of the
dining-room at Granite House, and consequently overlooked the shore
and the bay. Herbert proceeded as he was accustomed to do, and the
negative obtained, he went away to fix it by means of the chemicals
deposited in a dark nook of Granite House.

Returning to the bright light, and examining it well, Herbert
perceived on his negative an almost imperceptible little spot on
the sea horizon. He endeavored to make it disappear by reiterated
washing, but could not accomplish it.

"It is a flaw in the glass," he thought.

And then he had the curiosity to examine this flaw with a strong
magnifier which he unscrewed from one of the telescopes.

But he had scarcely looked at it, when he uttered a cry, and the
glass almost fell from his hands.

Immediately running to the room in which Cyrus Harding then was,
he extended the negative and magnifier towards the engineer,
pointing out the little spot.

Harding examined it; then seizing his telescope he rushed to the
window.

The telescope, after having slowly swept the horizon, at last
stopped on the looked-for spot, and Cyrus Harding, lowering it,
pronounced one word only,â€”

"A vessel!"
