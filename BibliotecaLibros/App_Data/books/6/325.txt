"Ayrton was alone, but he had no want of either ammunition,
weapons, tools, or seeds.

"At his, the convict's disposal, was the house built by honest
Captain Grant. He had only to live and expiate in solitude the
crimes which he had committed.

"Gentlemen, he repented, he was ashamed of his crimes and was
very miserable! He said to himself, that if men came some day to
take him from that islet, he must be worthy to return among them!
How he suffered, that wretched man! How he labored to recover
himself by work! How he prayed to be reformed by prayer! For two
years, three years, this went on, but Ayrton, humbled by solitude,
always looking for some ship to appear on the horizon, asking
himself if the time of expiation would soon be complete, suffered
as none other suffered! Oh! how dreadful was this solitude, to a
heart tormented by remorse!

"But doubtless Heaven had not sufficiently punished this unhappy
man, for he felt that he was gradually becoming a savage! He felt
that brutishness was gradually gaining on him!

"He could not say if it was after two or three years of
solitude, but at last he became the miserable creature you
found!

"I have no need to tell you, gentlemen, that Ayrton, Ben Joyce,
and I, are the same."

Cyrus Harding and his companions rose at the end of this
account. It is impossible to say how much they were moved! What
misery, grief, and despair lay revealed before them!

"Ayrton," said Harding, rising, "you have been a great criminal,
but Heaven must certainly think that you have expiated your crimes!
That has been proved by your having been brought again among your
fellow-creatures. Ayrton, you are forgiven! And now you will be our
companion?"

Ayrton drew back.

"Here is my hand!" said the engineer.
