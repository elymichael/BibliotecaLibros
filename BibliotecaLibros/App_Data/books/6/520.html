<br/>"Not so!" said Cyrus Harding, "should a day arrive when the sea,<br/>rushing through the wall of the cavern, penetrates by the central<br/>shaft into the interior of the island to the boiling lava, Lincoln<br/>Island will that day be blown into the airâ€”just as would happen to<br/>the island of Sicily were the Mediterranean to precipitate itself<br/>into Mount Etna."<br/><br/>The colonists made no answer to these significant words of the<br/>engineer. They now understood the danger by which they were<br/>menaced.<br/><br/>It may be added that Cyrus Harding had in no way exaggerated the<br/>danger to be apprehended. Many persons have formed an idea that it<br/>would be possible to extinguish volcanoes, which are almost always<br/>situated on the shores of a sea or lake, by opening a passage for<br/>the admission of the water. But they are not aware that this would<br/>be to incur the risk of blowing up a portion of the globe, like a<br/>boiler whose steam is suddenly expanded by intense heat. The water,<br/>rushing into a cavity whose temperature might be estimated at<br/>thousands of degrees, would be converted into steam with a sudden<br/>energy which no enclosure could resist.<br/><br/>It was not therefore doubtful that the island, menaced by a<br/>frightful and approaching convulsion, would endure only so long as<br/>the wall of Dakkar Grotto itself should endure. It was not even a<br/>question of months, nor of weeks, but of days; it might be of<br/>hours.<br/><br/>The first sentiment which the colonists felt was that of<br/>profound sorrow. They thought not so much of the peril which<br/>menaced themselves personally, but of the destruction of the island<br/>which had sheltered them, which they had cultivated, which they<br/>loved so well, and had hoped to render so flourishing. So much<br/>effort ineffectually expended, so much labor lost.<br/><br/>Pencroft could not prevent a large tear from rolling down his<br/>cheek, nor did he attempt to conceal it.<br/><br/>Some further conversation now took place. The chances yet in<br/>favor of the colonists were discussed; but finally it was agreed<br/>that there was not an hour to be lost, that the building and<br/>fitting of the vessel should be pushed forward with their utmost<br/>energy, and that this was the sole chance of safety for the<br/>inhabitants of Lincoln Island.<br/><br/>All hands, therefore, set to work on the vessel. What could it<br/>avail to sow, to reap, to hunt, to increase the stores of Granite<br/>House? The contents of the storehouse and outbuildings contained<br/>more than sufficient to provide the ship for a voyage, however long<br/>might be its duration. But it was imperative that the ship should<br/>be ready to receive them before the inevitable catastrophe should<br/>arrive.<br/><br/>Their labors were now carried on with feverish ardor. By the<br/>23rd of January the vessel was half-decked over. Up to this time no<br/>change had taken place on the summit of the volcano. Vapor and<br/>smoke mingled with flames and incandescent stones were thrown up<br/>from the crater. But during the night of the 23rd, in consequence<br/>of the lava attaining the level of the first stratum of the<br/>volcano, the hat-shaped cone which formed over the latter<br/>disappeared. A frightful sound was heard. The colonists at first<br/>thought the island was rent asunder, and rushed out of Granite<br/>House.<br/><br/>This occurred about two o'clock in the morning.<br/><br/>
