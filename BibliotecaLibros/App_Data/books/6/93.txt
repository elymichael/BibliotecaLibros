It was then half-past four. In order to prepare for dinner it
was necessary that the settlers should return to their dwelling.
The little band retraced their steps, therefore, and by the left
bank of the Mercy, Cyrus Harding and his companions arrived at the
Chimneys.

The fire was lighted, and Neb and Pencroft, on whom the
functions of cooks naturally devolved, to the one in his quality of
Negro, to the other in that of sailor, quickly prepared some
broiled agouti, to which they did great justice.

The repast at length terminated; at the moment when each one was
about to give himself up to sleep, Cyrus Harding drew from his
pocket little specimens of different sorts of minerals, and just
said,â€”

"My friends, this is iron mineral, this a pyrite, this is clay,
this is lime, and this is coal. Nature gives us these things. It is
our business to make a right use of them. To-morrow we will
commence operations."
