<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>2<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>Those whom the hurricane had just thrown on this coast were<br/>neither aeronauts by profession nor amateurs. They were prisoners<br/>of war whose boldness had induced them to escape in this<br/>extraordinary manner.<br/><br/>A hundred times they had almost perished! A hundred times had<br/>they almost fallen from their torn balloon into the depths of the<br/>ocean. But Heaven had reserved them for a strange destiny, and<br/>after having, on the 20th of March, escaped from Richmond, besieged<br/>by the troops of General Ulysses Grant, they found themselves seven<br/>thousand miles from the capital of Virginia, which was the<br/>principal stronghold of the South, during the terrible War of<br/>Secession. Their aerial voyage had lasted five days.<br/><br/>The curious circumstances which led to the escape of the<br/>prisoners were as follows:<br/><br/>That same year, in the month of February, 1865, in one of the<br/>coups de main by which General Grant attempted, though in vain, to<br/>possess himself of Richmond, several of his officers fell into the<br/>power of the enemy and were detained in the town. One of the most<br/>distinguished was Captain Cyrus Harding. He was a native of<br/>Massachusetts, a first-class engineer, to whom the government had<br/>confided, during the war, the direction of the railways, which were<br/>so important at that time. A true Northerner, thin, bony, lean,<br/>about forty-five years of age; his close-cut hair and his beard, of<br/>which he only kept a thick mustache, were already getting gray. He<br/>had one-of those finely-developed heads which appear made to be<br/>struck on a medal, piercing eyes, a serious mouth, the physiognomy<br/>of a clever man of the military school. He was one of those<br/>engineers who began by handling the hammer and pickaxe, like<br/>generals who first act as common soldiers. Besides mental power, he<br/>also possessed great manual dexterity. His muscles exhibited<br/>remarkable proofs of tenacity. A man of action as well as a man of<br/>thought, all he did was without effort to one of his vigorous and<br/>sanguine temperament. Learned, clear-headed, and practical, he<br/>fulfilled in all emergencies those three conditions which united<br/>ought to insure human successâ€”activity of mind and body, impetuous<br/>wishes, and powerful will. He might have taken for his motto that<br/>of William of Orange in the 17th century: "I can undertake and<br/>persevere even without hope of success." Cyrus Harding was courage<br/>personified. He had been in all the battles of that war. After<br/>having begun as a volunteer at Illinois, under Ulysses Grant, he<br/>fought at Paducah, Belmont, Pittsburg Landing, at the siege of<br/>Corinth, Port Gibson, Black River, Chattanooga, the Wilderness, on<br/>the Potomac, everywhere and valiantly, a soldier worthy of the<br/>general who said, "I never count my dead!" And hundreds of times<br/>Captain Harding had almost been among those who were not counted by<br/>the terrible Grant; but in these combats where he never spared<br/>himself, fortune favored him till the moment when he was wounded<br/>and taken prisoner on the field of battle near Richmond. At the<br/>same time and on the same day another important personage fell into<br/>the hands of the Southerners. This was no other than Gideon Spilen,<br/>a reporter for the New York Herald, who had been ordered to follow<br/>the changes of the war in the midst of the Northern armies.<br/><br/>Gideon Spilett was one of that race of indomitable English or<br/>American chroniclers, like Stanley and others, who stop at nothing<br/>to obtain exact information, and transmit it to their journal in<br/>the shortest possible time. The newspapers of the Union, such as<br/>the New York Herald, are genuine powers, and their reporters are<br/>men to be reckoned with. Gideon Spilett ranked among the first of<br/>those reporters: a man of great merit, energetic, prompt and ready<br/>for anything, full of ideas, having traveled over the whole world,<br/>soldier and artist, enthusiastic in council, resolute in action,<br/>caring neither for trouble, fatigue, nor danger, when in pursuit of<br/>information, for himself first, and then for his journal, a perfect<br/>treasury of knowledge on all sorts of curious subjects, of the<br/>unpublished, of the unknown, and of the impossible. He was one of<br/>those intrepid observers who write under fire, "reporting" among<br/>bullets, and to whom every danger is welcome.<br/><br/>He also had been in all the battles, in the first rank, revolver<br/>in one hand, note-book in the other; grape-shot never made his<br/>pencil tremble. He did not fatigue the wires with incessant<br/>telegrams, like those who speak when they have nothing to say, but<br/>each of his notes, short, decisive, and clear, threw light on some<br/>important point. Besides, he was not wanting in humor. It was he<br/>who, after the affair of the Black River, determined at any cost to<br/>keep his place at the wicket of the telegraph office, and after<br/>having announced to his journal the result of the battle,<br/>telegraphed for two hours the first chapters of the Bible. It cost<br/>the New York Herald two thousand dollars, but the New York Herald<br/>published the first intelligence.<br/><br/>
