"He is," replied the reporter, "or rather he was a man! There,
Cyrus, that is all we can tell you!"

The engineer was then informed of all that had passed during the
voyage, and under what conditions the search had been conducted;
how the only dwelling in the island had long been abandoned; how at
last a castaway had been captured, who appeared no longer to belong
to the human species.

"And that's just the point," added Pencroft, "I don't know if we
have done right to bring him here."

"Certainly you have, Pencroft," replied the engineer
quickly.

"But the wretched creature has no sense!"

"That is possible at present," replied Cyrus Harding, "but only
a few months ago the wretched creature was a man like you and me.
And who knows what will become of the survivor of us after a long
solitude on this island? It is a great misfortune to be alone, my
friends; and it must be believed that solitude can quickly destroy
reason, since you have found this poor creature in such a
state!"

"But, captain," asked Herbert, "what leads you to think that the
brutishness of the unfortunate man began only a few months
back?"

"Because the document we found had been recently written,"
answered the engineer, "and the castaway alone can have written
it."

"Always supposing," observed Gideon Spilett, "that it had not
been written by a companion of this man, since dead."

"That is impossible, my dear Spilett."
