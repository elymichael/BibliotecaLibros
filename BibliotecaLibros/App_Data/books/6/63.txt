"It is all that we have, Captain Harding."

"Thanks, my boy," replied Harding; "it will do—for this morning
at least."

He ate the wretched food with appetite, and washed it down with
a little fresh water, drawn from the river in an immense shell.

His companions looked at him without speaking. Then, feeling
somewhat refreshed, Cyrus Harding crossed his arms, and said,—

"So, my friends, you do not know yet whether fate has thrown us
on an island, or on a continent?"

"No, captain," replied the boy.

"We shall know to-morrow," said the engineer; "till then, there
is nothing to be done."

"Yes," replied Pencroft.

"What?"

"Fire," said the sailor, who, also, had a fixed idea.

"We will make it, Pencroft," replied Harding.
