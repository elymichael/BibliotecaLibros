<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>11<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>Half an hour later Cyrus Harding and Herbert had returned to the<br/>encampment. The engineer merely told his companions that the land<br/>upon which fate had thrown them was an island, and that the next<br/>day they would consult. Then each settled himself as well as he<br/>could to sleep, and in that rocky hole, at a height of two thousand<br/>five hundred feet above the level of the sea, through a peaceful<br/>night, the islanders enjoyed profound repose.<br/><br/>The next day, the 30th of March, after a hasty breakfast, which<br/>consisted solely of the roasted tragopan, the engineer wished to<br/>climb again to the summit of the volcano, so as more attentively to<br/>survey the island upon which he and his companions were imprisoned<br/>for life perhaps, should the island be situated at a great distance<br/>from any land, or if it was out of the course of vessels which<br/>visited the archipelagoes of the Pacific Ocean. This time his<br/>companions followed him in the new exploration. They also wished to<br/>see the island, on the productions of which they must depend for<br/>the supply of all their wants.<br/><br/>It was about seven o'clock in the morning when Cyrus Harding,<br/>Herbert, Pencroft, Gideon Spilett, and Neb quitted the encampment.<br/>No one appeared to be anxious about their situation. They had faith<br/>in themselves, doubtless, but it must be observed that the basis of<br/>this faith was not the same with Harding as with his companions.<br/>The engineer had confidence, because he felt capable of extorting<br/>from this wild country everything necessary for the life of himself<br/>and his companions; the latter feared nothing, just because Cyrus<br/>Harding was with them. Pencroft especially, since the incident of<br/>the relighted fire, would not have despaired for an instant, even<br/>if he was on a bare rock, if the engineer was with him on the<br/>rock.<br/><br/>"Pshaw," said he, "we left Richmond without permission from the<br/>authorities! It will be hard if we don't manage to get away some<br/>day or other from a place where certainly no one will detain<br/>us!"<br/><br/>Cyrus Harding followed the same road as the evening before. They<br/>went round the cone by the plateau which formed the shoulder, to<br/>the mouth of the enormous chasm. The weather was magnificent. The<br/>sun rose in a pure sky and flooded with his rays all the eastern<br/>side of the mountain.<br/><br/>The crater was reached. It was just what the engineer had made<br/>it out to be in the dark; that is to say, a vast funnel which<br/>extended, widening, to a height of a thousand feet above the<br/>plateau. Below the chasm, large thick streaks of lava wound over<br/>the sides of the mountain, and thus marked the course of the<br/>eruptive matter to the lower valleys which furrowed the northern<br/>part of the island.<br/><br/>
