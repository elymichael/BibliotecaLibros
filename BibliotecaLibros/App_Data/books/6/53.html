The engineer nodded faintly, and then appeased to sleep.<br/><br/>They respected this sleep, and the reporter began immediately to<br/>make arrangements for transporting Harding to a more comfortable<br/>place. Neb, Herbert, and Pencroft left the cave and directed their<br/>steps towards a high mound crowned with a few distorted trees. On<br/>the way the sailor could not help repeating,—<br/><br/>"Island or continent! To think of that, when at one's last gasp!<br/>What a man!"<br/><br/>Arrived at the summit of the mound, Pencroft and his two<br/>companions set to work, with no other tools than their hands, to<br/>despoil of its principal branches a rather sickly tree, a sort of<br/>marine fir; with these branches they made a litter, on which,<br/>covered with grass and leaves, they could carry the engineer.<br/><br/>This occupied them nearly forty minutes, and it was ten o'clock<br/>when they returned to Cyrus Harding whom Spilett had not left.<br/><br/>The engineer was just awaking from the sleep, or rather from the<br/>drowsiness, in which they had found him. The color was returning to<br/>his cheeks, which till now had been as pale as death. He raised<br/>himself a little, looked around him, and appeared to ask where he<br/>was.<br/><br/>"Can you listen to me without fatigue, Cyrus?" asked the<br/>reporter.<br/><br/>"Yes," replied the engineer.<br/><br/>"It's my opinion," said the sailor, "that Captain Harding will<br/>be able to listen to you still better, if he will have some more<br/>grouse jelly,—for we have grouse, captain," added he, presenting<br/>him with a little of this jelly, to which he this time added some<br/>of the flesh.<br/><br/>Cyrus Harding ate a little of the grouse, and the rest was<br/>divided among his companions, who found it but a meager breakfast,<br/>for they were suffering extremely from hunger.<br/><br/>"Well!" said the sailor, "there is plenty of food at the<br/>Chimneys, for you must know, captain, that down there, in the<br/>south, we have a house, with rooms, beds, and fireplace, and in the<br/>pantry, several dozen of birds, which our Herbert calls couroucous.<br/>Your litter is ready, and as soon as you feel strong enough we will<br/>carry you home."<br/>
