Winter arrived with the month of June, which is the December of
the northern zones, and the great business was the making of warm
and solid clothing.

The musmons in the corral had been stripped of their wool, and
this precious textile material was now to be transformed into
stuff.

Of course Cyrus Harding, having at his disposal neither carders,
combers, polishers, stretchers, twisters, mule-jenny, nor
self-acting machine to spin the wool, nor loom to weave it, was
obliged to proceed in a simpler way, so as to do without spinning
and weaving. And indeed he proposed to make use of the property
which the filaments of wool possess when subjected to a powerful
pressure of mixing together, and of manufacturing by this simple
process the material called felt. This felt could then be obtained
by a simple operation which, if it diminished the flexibility of
the stuff, increased its power of retaining heat in proportion. Now
the wool furnished by the musmons was composed of very short hairs,
and was in a good condition to be felted.

The engineer, aided by his companions, including Pencroft, who
was once more obliged to leave his boat, commenced the preliminary
operations, the subject of which was to rid the wool of that fat
and oily substance with which it is impregnated, and which is
called grease. This cleaning was done in vats filled with water,
which was maintained at the temperature of seventy degrees, and in
which the wool was soaked for four-and-twenty hours; it was then
thoroughly washed in baths of soda, and, when sufficiently dried by
pressure, it was in a state to be compressed, that is to say, to
produce a solid material, rough, no doubt, and such as would have
no value in a manufacturing center of Europe or America, but which
would be highly esteemed in the Lincoln Island markets.

This sort of material must have been known from the most ancient
times, and, in fact, the first woolen stuffs were manufactured by
the process which Harding was now about to employ. Where Harding's
engineering qualifications now came into play was in the
construction of the machine for pressing the wool; for he knew how
to turn ingeniously to profit the mechanical force, hitherto
unused, which the waterfall on the beach possessed to move a
fulling-mill.

Nothing could be more rudimentary. The wool was placed in
troughs, and upon it fell in turns heavy wooden mallets; such was
the machine in question, and such it had been for centuries until
the time when the mallets were replaced by cylinders of
compression, and the material was no longer subjected to beating,
but to regular rolling.
