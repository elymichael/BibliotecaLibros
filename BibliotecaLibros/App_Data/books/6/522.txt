Towards seven in the morning the position was no longer tenable
by the colonists, who accordingly took shelter in the borders of
Jacamar Wood. Not only did the projectiles begin to rain around
them, but the lava, overflowing the bed of Red Creek, threatened to
cut off the road to the corral. The nearest rows of trees caught
fire, and their sap, suddenly transformed into vapor, caused them
to explode with loud reports, while others, less moist, remained
unhurt in the midst of the inundation.

The colonists had again taken the road to the corral. They
proceeded but slowly, frequently looking back; but, in consequence
of the inclination of the soil, the lava gained rapidly in the
east, and as its lower waves became solidified others, at boiling
heat, covered them immediately.

Meanwhile, the principal stream of Red Creek Valley became more
and more menacing. All this portion of the forest was on fare, and
enormous wreaths of smoke rolled over the trees, whore trunks were
already consumed by the lava.

The colonists halted near the lake, about half a mile from the
mouth of Red Creek. A question of life or death was now to be
decided.

Cyrus Harding, accustomed to the consideration of important
crises, and aware that he was addressing men capable of hearing the
truth, whatever it might be, then said,—

"Either the lake will arrest the progress of the lava, and a
part of the island will be preserved from utter destruction, or the
stream will overrun the forests of the Far West, and not a tree or
plant will remain on the surface of the soil. We shall have no
prospect but that of starvation upon these barren rocks—a death
which will probably be anticipated by the explosion of the
island."

"In that case," replied Pencroft, folding his arms and stamping
his foot, "what's the use of working any longer on the vessel?"

"Pencroft," answered Cyrus Harding, "we must do our duty to the
last!"

At this instant the river of lava, after having broken a passage
through the noble trees it devoured in its course, reached the
borders of the lake. At this point there was an elevation of the
soil which, had it been greater, might have sufficed to arrest the
torrent.

"To work!" cried Cyrus Harding.
