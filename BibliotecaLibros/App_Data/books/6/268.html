It appeared as if Jup understood, for he leaned his head on<br/>Pencroft's shoulder as if to thank him. The sailor was wounded<br/>himself, but his wound was insignificant, as were those of his<br/>companions; for thanks to their firearms they had been almost<br/>always able to keep their assailants at a distance. it was<br/>therefore only the orang whose condition was serious.<br/><br/>Jup, carried by Neb and Pencroft, was placed in the lift, and<br/>only a slight moan now and then escaped his lips. He was gently<br/>drawn up to Granite House. There he was laid on a mattress taken<br/>from one of the beds, and his wounds were bathed with the greatest<br/>care. It did not appear that any vital part had been reached, but<br/>Jup was very weak from loss of blood, and a high fever soon set in<br/>after his wounds had been dressed. He was laid down, strict diet<br/>was imposed, "just like a real person," as Neb said, and they made<br/>him swallow several cups of a cooling drink, for which the<br/>ingredients were supplied from the vegetable medicine chest of<br/>Granite House. Jup was at first restless, but his breathing<br/>gradually became more regular, and he was left sleeping quietly.<br/>From time to time Top, walking on tip-toe, as one might say, came<br/>to visit his friend, and seemed to approve of all the care that had<br/>been taken of him. One of Jup's hands hung over the side of his<br/>bed, and Top licked it with a sympathizing air.<br/><br/>They employed the day in interring the dead, who were dragged to<br/>the forest of the Far West, and there buried deep.<br/><br/>This attack, which might have had such serious consequences, was<br/>a lesson to the settlers, who from this time never went to bed<br/>until one of their number had made sure that all the bridges were<br/>raised, and that no invasion was possible.<br/><br/>However, Jup, after having given them serious anxiety for<br/>several days, began to recover. His constitution brought him<br/>through, the fever gradually subsided, and Gideon Spilett, who was<br/>a bit of a doctor, pronounced him quite out of danger. On the 16th<br/>of August, Jup began to eat. Neb made him nice little sweet dishes,<br/>which the invalid devoured with great relish, for if he had a pet<br/>failing it was that of being somewhat of a gourmend, and Neb had<br/>never done anything to cure him of this fault.<br/><br/>"What would you have?" said he to Gideon Spilett, who sometimes<br/>expostulated with him for spoiling the ape. "Poor Jup has no other<br/>pleasure than that of the palate, and I am only too glad to be able<br/>to reward his services in this way!"<br/><br/>Ten days after taking to his bed, on the 21st of August, Master<br/>Jup arose. His wounds were healed, and it was evident that he would<br/>not be long in regaining his usual strength and agility. Like all<br/>convalescents, he was tremendously hungry, and the reporter allowed<br/>him to eat as much as he liked, for he trusted to that instinct,<br/>which is too often wanting in reasoning beings, to keep the orang<br/>from any excess. Neb was delighted to see his pupil's appetite<br/>returning.<br/><br/>"Eat away, my Jup," said he, "and don't spare anything; you have<br/>shed your blood for us, and it is the least I can do to make you<br/>strong again!"<br/><br/>On the 25th of August Neb's voice was heard calling to his<br/>companions.<br/><br/>"Captain, Mr. Spilett, Mr. Herbert, Pencroft, come! come!"<br/><br/>The colonists, who were together in the dining-room, rose at<br/>Neb's call, who was then in Jup's room.<br/>
