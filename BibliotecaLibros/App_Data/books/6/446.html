It was also decided that no one should remain at Granite House.<br/>Top and Jup themselves were to accompany the expedition; the<br/>inaccessible dwelling needed no guard. The 14th of February, eve of<br/>the departure, was consecrated entirely to repose, and—thanksgiving<br/>addressed by the colonists to the Creator. A place in the cart was<br/>reserved for Herbert, who, though thoroughly convalescent, was<br/>still a little weak. The next morning, at daybreak, Cyrus Harding<br/>took the necessary measures to protect Granite House from any<br/>invasion. The ladders, which were formerly used for the ascent,<br/>were brought to the Chimneys and buried deep in the sand, so that<br/>they might be available on the return of the colonists, for the<br/>machinery of the lift had been taken to pieces, and nothing of the<br/>apparatus remained. Pencroft stayed the last in Granite House in<br/>order to finish this work, and he then lowered himself down by<br/>means of a double rope held below, and which, when once hauled<br/>down, left no communication between the upper landing and the<br/>beach.<br/><br/>The weather was magnificent.<br/><br/>"We shall have a warm day of it," said the reporter,<br/>laughing.<br/><br/>"Pooh! Dr. Spilett," answered Pencroft, "we shall walk under the<br/>shade of the trees and shan't even see the sun!"<br/><br/>"Forward!" said the engineer.<br/><br/>The cart was waiting on the beach before the Chimneys. The<br/>reporter made Herbert take his place in it during the first hours<br/>at least of the journey, and the lad was obliged to submit to his<br/>doctor's orders.<br/><br/>Neb placed himself at the onagers' heads. Cyrus Harding, the<br/>reporter, and the sailor, walked in front. Top bounded joyfully<br/>along. Herbert offered a seat in his vehicle to Jup, who accepted<br/>it without ceremony. The moment for departure had arrived, and the<br/>little band set out.<br/><br/>The cart first turned the angle of the mouth of the Mercy, then,<br/>having ascended the left bank for a mile, crossed the bridge, at<br/>the other side of which commenced the road to Port Balloon, and<br/>there the explorers, leaving this road on their left, entered the<br/>cover of the immense woods which formed the region of the Far<br/>West.<br/><br/>For the first two miles the widely scattered trees allowed the<br/>cart to pass with ease; from time to time it became necessary to<br/>cut away a few creepers and bushes, but no serious obstacle impeded<br/>the progress of the colonists.<br/><br/>The thick foliage of the trees threw a grateful shade on the<br/>ground. Deodars, Douglas firs, casuarinas, banksias, gum-trees,<br/>dragon-trees, and other well-known species, succeeded each other<br/>far as the eye could reach. The feathered tribes of the island were<br/>all represented—grouse, jacamars, pheasants, lories, as well as the<br/>chattering cockatoos, parrots, and paroquets. Agouties, kangaroos,<br/>and capybaras fled swiftly at their approach; and all this reminded<br/>the settlers of the first excursions they had made on their arrival<br/>at the island.<br/><br/>"Nevertheless," observed Cyrus Harding, "I notice that these<br/>creatures, both birds and quadrupeds, are more timid than formerly.<br/>These woods have, therefore, been recently traversed by the<br/>convicts, and we shall certainly find some traces of them."<br/>
