"At Lincoln Island!" exclaimed in a breath Gideon Spilett,
Herbert, Neb, and Pencroft, in the highest degree astonished.

"How could you be aware of the existence of Lincoln Island?"
inquired Cyrus Harding, "it is not even named in the charts."

"I knew of it from a document left by you on Tabor Island,"
answered Robert Grant.

"A document!" cried Gideon Spilett.

"Without doubt, and here it is," answered Robert Grant,
producing a paper which indicated the longitude and latitude of
Lincoln Island, "the present residence of Ayrton and five American
colonists."

"It is Captain Nemo!" cried Cyrus Harding, after having read the
notice, and recognized that the handwriting was similar to that of
the paper found at the corral.

"Ah!" said Pencroft, "it was then he who took our 'Bonadventure'
and hazarded himself alone to go to Tabor Island!"

"In order to leave this notice," added Herbert.

"I was then right in saying," exclaimed the sailor, "that even
after his death the captain would render us a last service."

"My friends," said Cyrus Harding, in a voice of the profoundest
emotion, "may the God of mercy have had pity on the soul of Captain
Nemo, our benefactor."

The colonists uncovered themselves at these last words of Cyrus
Harding, and murmured the name of Captain Nemo.
