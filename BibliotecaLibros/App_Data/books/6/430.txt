"It is that Ayrton was not killed at the corral! That they
dragged him away living, since he has resisted. Therefore, perhaps,
he is still living!"

"Perhaps, indeed," replied the engineer, who remained
thoughtful.

This was a hope, to which Ayrton's companions could still hold.
Indeed, they had before believed that, surprised in the corral,
Ayrton had fallen by a bullet, as Herbert had fallen. But if the
convicts had not killed him at first, if they had brought him
living to another part of the island, might it not be admitted that
he was still their prisoner? Perhaps, even, one of them had found
in Ayrton his old Australian companion Ben Joyce, the chief of the
escaped convicts. And who knows but that they had conceived the
impossible hope of bringing back Ayrton to themselves? He would
have been very useful to them, if they had been able to make him
turn traitor!

This incident was, therefore, favorably interpreted at the
corral, and it no longer appeared impossible that they should find
Ayrton again. On his side, if he was only a prisoner, Ayrton would
no doubt do all he could to escape from the hands of the villains,
and this would be a powerful aid to the settlers!

"At any rate," observed Gideon Spilett, "if happily Ayrton did
manage to escape, he would go directly to Granite House, for he
could not know of the attempted assassination of which Herbert has
been a victim, and consequently would never think of our being
imprisoned in the corral."

"Oh! I wish that he was there, at Granite House!" cried
Pencroft, "and that we were there, too! For, although the rascals
can do nothing to our house, they may plunder the plateau, our
plantations, our poultry-yard!"

Pencroft had become a thorough farmer, heartily attached to his
crops. But it must be said that Herbert was more anxious than any
to return to Granite House, for he knew how much the presence of
the settlers was needed there. And it was he who was keeping them
at the corral! Therefore, one idea occupied his mindâ€”to leave the
corral, and when! He believed he could bear removal to Granite
House. He was sure his strength would return more quickly in his
room, with the air and sight of the sea!

Several times he pressed Gideon Spilett, but the latter,
fearing, with good reason, that Herbert's wounds, half healed,
might reopen on the way, did not give the order to start.

However, something occurred which compelled Cyrus Harding and
his two friends to yield to the lad's wish, and God alone knew that
this determination might cause them grief and remorse.

It was the 29th of November, seven o'clock in the evening. The
three settlers were talking in Herbert's room, when they heard Top
utter quick barks.
