"No," replied the sailor; "but what I do know is, that I am
nothing better than a fool!"

"Well, they would make more than three millions, at a hundred
and thirty thousand a bushel, Pencroft."

"Three millions!" cried Pencroft.

"Three millions."

"In four years?"

"In four years," replied Cyrus Harding, "and even in two years,
if, as I hope, in this latitude we can obtain two crops a
year."

At that, according to his usual custom, Pencroft could not reply
otherwise than by a tremendous hurrah.

"So, Herbert," added the engineer, "you have made a discovery of
great importance to us. Everything, my friends, everything can
serve us in the condition in which we are. Do not forget that, I
beg of you."

"No, captain, no, we shan't forget it," replied Pencroft; "and
if ever I find one of those tobacco-seeds, which multiply by three
hundred and sixty thousand, I assure you I won't throw it away! And
now, what must we do?"

"We must plant this grain," replied Herbert.

"Yes," added Gideon Spilett, "and with every possible care, for
it bears in itself our future harvests."
