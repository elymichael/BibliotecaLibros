"Shall we leave the cart in the wood?" asked Neb.

"No," replied the engineer, "it is our wagon of ammunition and
provisions, and, if necessary, it would serve as an
entrenchment."

"Forward, then!" said Gideon Spilett.

The cart emerged from the wood and began to roll noiselessly
towards the palisade. The darkness was now profound, the silence as
complete as when Pencroft and the reporter crept over the ground.
The thick grass completely muffled their footsteps. The colonists
held themselves ready to fire. Jup, at Pencroft's orders, kept
behind. Neb led Top in a leash, to prevent him from bounding
forward.

The clearing soon came in sight. It was deserted. Without
hesitating, the little band moved towards the palisade. In a short
space of time the dangerous zone was passed. Neb remained at the
onagers' heads to hold them. The engineer, the reporter, Herbert,
and Pencroft, proceeded to the door, in order to ascertain if it
was barricaded inside. It was open!

"What do you say now?" asked the engineer, turning to the sailor
and Spilett.

Both were stupefied.

"I can swear," said Pencroft, "that this gate was shut just
now!"

The colonists now hesitated. Were the convicts in the corral
when Pencroft and the reporter made their reconnaissance? It could
not be doubted, as the gate then closed could only have been opened
by them. Were they still there, or had one of their number just
gone out?

All these questions presented themselves simultaneously to the
minds of the colonists, but how could they be answered?

At that moment, Herbert, who had advanced a few steps into the
enclosure, drew back hurriedly, and seized Harding's hand.
