"Out of seven," added Neb; "Top is quite worth another."

"There is no risk at all in it, captain," replied Pencroft.

"That is possible, Pencroft; but I repeat it is to expose
ourselves uselessly."

The obstinate sailor did not reply, and let the conversation
drop, quite determined to resume it again. But he did not suspect
that an incident would come to his aid and change into an act of
humanity that which was at first only a doubtful whim.

After standing off the shore the "Bonadventure" again approached
it in the direction of Port Balloon. It was important to ascertain
the channels between the sandbanks and reefs, that buoys might be
laid down since this little creek was to be the harbor.

They were not more than half a mile from the coast, and it was
necessary to tack to beat against the wind. The "Bonadventure" was
then going at a very moderate rate, as the breeze, partly
intercepted by the high land, scarcely swelled her sails, and the
sea, smooth as glass, was only rippled now and then by passing
gusts.

Herbert had stationed himself in the bows that he might indicate
the course to be followed among the channels, when all at once he
shouted,—

"Luff, Pencroft, luff!"

"What's the matter," replied the sailor; "a rock?"

"No—wait," said Herbert; "I don't quite see. Luff
again—right—now."
