We could<br/>not even suppose that after it had stayed for any length of time on<br/>the shore, it would have been swept off by the sea, for the south<br/>coast is all rocks, and it would certainly have been smashed to<br/>pieces there!"<br/><br/>"That is true," rejoined Cyrus Harding thoughtfully.<br/>
