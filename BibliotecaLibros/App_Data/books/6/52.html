<br/>The explanation of this fact could only be produced from the<br/>engineer's own lips, and they must wait for that till speech<br/>returned. Rubbing had re-established the circulation of the blood.<br/>Cyrus Harding moved his arm again, then his head, and a few<br/>incomprehensible words escaped him.<br/><br/>Neb, who was bending over him, spoke, but the engineer did not<br/>appear to hear, and his eyes remained closed. Life was only<br/>exhibited in him by movement, his senses had not as yet been<br/>restored.<br/><br/>Pencroft much regretted not having either fire, or the means of<br/>procuring it, for he had, unfortunately, forgotten to bring the<br/>burnt linen, which would easily have ignited from the sparks<br/>produced by striking together two flints. As to the engineer's<br/>pockets, they were entirely empty, except that of his waistcoat,<br/>which contained his watch. It was necessary to carry Harding to the<br/>Chimneys, and that as soon as possible. This was the opinion of<br/>all.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the care which was lavished on the engineer brought<br/>him back to consciousness sooner than they could have expected. The<br/>water with which they wetted his lips revived him gradually.<br/>Pencroft also thought of mixing with the water some moisture from<br/>the titra's flesh which he had brought. Herbert ran to the beach<br/>and returned with two large bivalve shells. The sailor concocted<br/>something which he introduced between the lips of the engineer, who<br/>eagerly drinking it opened his eyes.<br/><br/>Neb and the reporter were leaning over him.<br/><br/>"My master! my master!" cried Neb.<br/><br/>The engineer heard him. He recognized Neb and Spilett, then his<br/>other two companions, and his hand slightly pressed theirs.<br/><br/>A few words again escaped him, which showed what thoughts were,<br/>even then, troubling his brain. This time he was understood.<br/>Undoubtedly they were the same words he had before attempted to<br/>utter.<br/><br/>"Island or continent?" he murmured.<br/><br/>"Bother the continent," cried Pencroft hastily; "there is time<br/>enough to see about that, captain! we don't care for anything,<br/>provided you are living."<br/><br/>
