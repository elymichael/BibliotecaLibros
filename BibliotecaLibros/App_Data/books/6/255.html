The operation, ably directed by Cyrus Harding, was a complete<br/>success. The wool, previously impregnated with a solution of soap,<br/>intended on the one hand to facilitate the interlacing, the<br/>compression, and the softening of the wool, and on the other to<br/>prevent its diminution by the beating, issued from the mill in the<br/>shape of thick felt cloth. The roughnesses with which the staple of<br/>wool is naturally filled were so thoroughly entangled and<br/>interlaced together that a material was formed equally suitable<br/>either for garments or bedclothes. It was certainly neither merino,<br/>muslin, cashmere, rep, satin, alpaca, cloth, nor flannel. It was<br/>"Lincolnian felt," and Lincoln Island possessed yet another<br/>manufacture. The colonists had now warm garments and thick<br/>bedclothes, and they could without fear await the approach of the<br/>winter of 1866-67.<br/><br/>The severe cold began to be felt about the 20th of June, and, to<br/>his great regret, Pencroft was obliged to suspend his<br/>boat-building, which he hoped to finish in time for next<br/>spring.<br/><br/>The sailor's great idea was to make a voyage of discovery to<br/>Tabor Island, although Harding could not approve of a voyage simply<br/>for curiosity's sake, for there was evidently nothing to be found<br/>on this desert and almost arid rock. A voyage of a hundred and<br/>fifty miles in a comparatively small vessel, over unknown seas,<br/>could not but cause him some anxiety. Suppose that their vessel,<br/>once out at sea, should be unable to reach Tabor Island, and could<br/>not return to Lincoln Island, what would become of her in the midst<br/>of the Pacific, so fruitful of disasters?<br/><br/>Harding often talked over this project with Pencroft, and he<br/>found him strangely bent upon undertaking this voyage, for which<br/>determination he himself could give no sufficient reason.<br/><br/>"Now," said the engineer one day to him, "I must observe, my<br/>friend, that after having said so much, in praise of Lincoln<br/>Island, after having spoken so often of the sorrow you would feel<br/>if you were obliged to forsake it, you are the first to wish to<br/>leave it."<br/><br/>"Only to leave it for a few days," replied Pencroft, "only for a<br/>few days, captain. Time to go and come back, and see what that<br/>islet is like!"<br/><br/>"But it is not nearly as good as Lincoln Island."<br/><br/>"I know that beforehand."<br/><br/>"Then why venture there?"<br/><br/>"To know what is going on in Tabor Island."<br/><br/>"But nothing is going on there; nothing could happen there."<br/>
