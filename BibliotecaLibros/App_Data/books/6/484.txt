"He would not have called us if the means had been wanting to
enable us to reach him!"

Cyrus Harding spoke in a tone of such thorough conviction that
no objection was raised. His remark, besides, was logical. It was
quite possible that an opening, practicable at low water, though
hidden now by the high tide, opened at the foot of the cliff.

There was some time to wait. The colonists remained silently
crouching in a deep hollow. Rain now began to fall in torrents. The
thunder was re- echoed among the rocks with a grand
sonorousness.

The colonists' emotion was great. A thousand strange and
extraordinary ideas crossed their brains, and they expected some
grand and superhuman apparition, which alone could come up to the
notion they had formed of the mysterious genius of the island.

At midnight, Harding carrying the lantern, descended to the
beach to reconnoiter.

The engineer was not mistaken. The beginning of an immense
excavation could be seen under the water. There the wire, bending
at a right angle, entered the yawning gulf.

Cyrus Harding returned to his companions, and said simply,â€”

"In an hour the opening will be practicable."

"It is there, then?" said Pencroft.

"Did you doubt it?" returned Harding.

"But this cavern must be filled with water to a certain height,"
observed Herbert.
