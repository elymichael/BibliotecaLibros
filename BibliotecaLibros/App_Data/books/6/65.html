"I cannot say exactly," replied the engineer, "but I presume it<br/>is some land in the Pacific. In fact, when we left Richmond, the<br/>wind was blowing from the northeast, and its very violence greatly<br/>proves that it could not have varied. If the direction has been<br/>maintained from the northeast to the southwest, we have traversed<br/>the States of North Carolina, of South Carolina, of Georgia, the<br/>Gulf of Mexico, Mexico, itself, in its narrow part, then a part of<br/>the Pacific Ocean. I cannot estimate the distance traversed by the<br/>balloon at less than six to seven thousand miles, and, even<br/>supposing that the wind had varied half a quarter, it must have<br/>brought us either to the archipelago of Mendava, either on the<br/>Pomotous, or even, if it had a greater strength than I suppose, to<br/>the land of New Zealand. If the last hypothesis is correct, it will<br/>be easy enough to get home again. English or Maoris, we shall<br/>always find some one to whom we can speak. If, on the contrary,<br/>this is the coast of a desert island in some tiny archipelago,<br/>perhaps we shall be able to reconnoiter it from the summit of that<br/>peak which overlooks the country, and then we shall see how best to<br/>establish ourselves here as if we are never to go away."<br/><br/>"Never?" cried the reporter. "You say 'Never,' my dear<br/>Cyrus?"<br/><br/>"Better to put things at the worst at first," replied the<br/>engineer, "and reserve the best for a surprise."<br/><br/>"Well said," remarked Pencroft. "It is to be hoped, too, that<br/>this island, if it be one, is not situated just out of the course<br/>of ships; that would be really unlucky!"<br/><br/>"We shall not know what we have to rely on until we have first<br/>made the ascent of the mountain," replied the engineer.<br/><br/>"But to-morrow, captain," asked Herbert, "shall you be in a<br/>state to bear the fatigue of the ascent?"<br/><br/>"I hope so," replied the engineer, "provided you and Pencroft,<br/>my boy, show yourselves quick and clever hunters."<br/><br/>"Captain," said the sailor, "since you are speaking of game, if<br/>on my return, I was as certain of roasting it as I am of bringing<br/>it back—"<br/><br/>"Bring it back all the same, Pencroft," replied Harding.<br/><br/>It was then agreed that the engineer and the reporter were to<br/>pass the day at the Chimneys, so as to examine the shore and the<br/>upper plateau. Neb, Herbert, and the sailor were to return to the<br/>forest, renew their store of wood, and lay violent hands on every<br/>creature, feathered or hairy, which might come within their<br/>reach.<br/><br/>They set out accordingly about ten o'clock in the morning,<br/>Herbert confident, Neb joyous, Pencroft murmuring aside,—<br/>
