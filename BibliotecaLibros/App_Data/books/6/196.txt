Several pigs, agoutis, kangaroos, and other rodents were seen,
also two or three koalas, at which Pencroft longed to have a
shot.

"But," said he, "you may jump and play just now; we shall have
one or two words to say to you on our way back!"

At half-past nine the way was suddenly found to be barred by an
unknown stream, from thirty to forty feet broad, whose rapid
current dashed foaming over the numerous rocks which interrupted
its course. This creek was deep and clear, but it was absolutely
unnavigable.

"We are cut off!" cried Neb.

"No," replied Herbert, "it is only a stream, and we can easily
swim over."

"What would be the use of that?" returned Harding. "This creek
evidently runs to the sea. Let us remain on this side and follow
the bank, and I shall be much astonished if it does not lead us
very quickly to the coast. Forward!"

"One minute," said the reporter. "The name of this creek, my
friends? Do not let us leave our geography incomplete."

"All right!" said Pencroft.

"Name it, my boy," said the engineer, addressing the lad.

"Will it not be better to wait until we have explored it to its
mouth?" answered Herbert.

"Very well," replied Cyrus Harding. "Let us follow it as fast as
we can without stopping."
