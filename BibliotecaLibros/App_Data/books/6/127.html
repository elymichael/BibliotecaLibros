<br/>They then left the transformation to complete itself, and it<br/>would not take less than ten or twelve days for the sulphuret of<br/>iron to be changed to sulphate of iron and the alumina into<br/>sulphate of alumina, two equally soluble substances, the others,<br/>flint, burnt coal, and cinders, not being so.<br/><br/>While this chemical work was going on, Cyrus Harding proceeded<br/>with other operations, which were pursued with more than zeal,—it<br/>was eagerness.<br/><br/>Neb and Pencroft had taken away the fat from the dugong, and<br/>placed it in large earthen pots. It was then necessary to separate<br/>the glycerine from the fat by saponifying it. Now, to obtain this<br/>result, it had to be treated either with soda or lime. In fact, one<br/>or other of these substances, after having attacked the fat, would<br/>form a soap by separating the glycerine, and it was just this<br/>glycerine which the engineer wished to obtain. There was no want of<br/>lime, only treatment by lime would give calcareous soap, insoluble,<br/>and consequently useless, while treatment by soda would furnish, on<br/>the contrary, a soluble soap, which could be put to domestic use.<br/>Now, a practical man, like Cyrus Harding, would rather try to<br/>obtain soda. Was this difficult? No; for marine plants abounded on<br/>the shore, glass-wort, ficoides, and all those fucaceae which form<br/>wrack. A large quantity of these plants was collected, first dried,<br/>then burnt in holes in the open air. The combustion of these plants<br/>was kept up for several days, and the result was a compact gray<br/>mass, which has been long known under the name of "natural<br/>soda."<br/><br/>This obtained, the engineer treated the fat with soda, which<br/>gave both a soluble soap and that neutral substance, glycerine.<br/><br/>But this was not all. Cyrus Harding still needed, in view of his<br/>future preparation, another substance, nitrate of potash, which is<br/>better known under the name of salt niter, or of saltpeter.<br/><br/>Cyrus Harding could have manufactured this substance by treating<br/>the carbonate of potash, which would be easily extracted from the<br/>cinders of the vegetables, by azotic acid. But this acid was<br/>wanting, and he would have been in some difficulty, if nature had<br/>not happily furnished the saltpeter, without giving them any other<br/>trouble than that of picking it up. Herbert found a vein of it at<br/>the foot of Mount Franklin, and they had nothing to do but purify<br/>this salt.<br/><br/>These different works lasted a week. They were finished before<br/>the transformation of the sulphuret into sulphate of iron had been<br/>accomplished. During the following days the settlers had time to<br/>construct a furnace of bricks of a particular arrangement, to serve<br/>for the distillation of the sulphate or iron when it had been<br/>obtained. All this was finished about the 18th of May, nearly at<br/>the time when the chemical transformation terminated. Gideon<br/>Spilett, Herbert, Neb, and Pencroft, skillfully directed by the<br/>engineer, had become most clever workmen. Before all masters,<br/>necessity is the one most listened to, and who teaches the<br/>best.<br/><br/>When the heap of pyrites had been entirely reduced by fire, the<br/>result of the operation, consisting of sulphate of iron, sulphate<br/>of alumina, flint, remains of coal, and cinders was placed in a<br/>basinful of water. They stirred this mixture, let it settle, then<br/>decanted it, and obtained a clear liquid containing in solution<br/>sulphate of iron and sulphate of alumina, the other matters<br/>remaining solid, since they are insoluble. Lastly, this liquid<br/>being partly evaporated, crystals of sulphate of iron were<br/>deposited, and the not evaporated liquid, which contained the<br/>sulphate of alumina, was thrown away.<br/><br/>Cyrus Harding had now at his disposal a large quantity of these<br/>sulphate of iron crystals, from which the sulphuric acid had to be<br/>extracted. The making of sulphuric acid is a very expensive<br/>manufacture. Considerable works are necessary—a special set of<br/>tools, an apparatus of platina, leaden chambers, unassailable by<br/>the acid, and in which the transformation is performed, etc. The<br/>engineer had none of these at his disposal, but he knew that, in<br/>Bohemia especially, sulphuric acid is manufactured by very simple<br/>means, which have also the advantage of producing it to a superior<br/>degree of concentration. It is thus that the acid known under the<br/>name of Nordhausen acid is made.<br/><br/>To obtain sulphuric acid, Cyrus Harding had only one operation<br/>to make, to calcine the sulphate of iron crystals in a closed vase,<br/>so that the sulphuric acid should distil in vapor, which vapor, by<br/>condensation, would produce the acid.<br/><br/>
