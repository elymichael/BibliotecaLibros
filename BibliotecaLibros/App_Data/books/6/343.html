"And the more so that it is a full moon to-day," remarked<br/>Herbert, "and these April tides are very strong."<br/><br/>"Well, Pencroft," asked Harding, "can you not anchor off the<br/>Cape?"<br/><br/>"Anchor near land, with bad weather coming on!" exclaimed the<br/>sailor. "What are you thinking of, captain? We should run aground,<br/>of a certainty!"<br/><br/>"What will you do then?"<br/><br/>"I shall try to keep in the offing until the flood, that is to<br/>say, till about seven in the evening, and if there is still light<br/>enough I will try to enter the gulf; if not, we must stand off and<br/>on during the night, and we will enter to-morrow at sunrise."<br/><br/>"As I told you, Pencroft, we will leave it to you," answered<br/>Harding.<br/><br/>"Ah!" said Pencroft, "if there was only a lighthouse on the<br/>coast, it would be much more convenient for sailors."<br/><br/>"Yes," replied Herbert, "and this time we shall have no obliging<br/>engineer to light a fire to guide us into port!"<br/><br/>"Why, indeed, my dear Cyrus," said Spilett, "we have never<br/>thanked you; but frankly, without that fire we should never have<br/>been ableâ€”"<br/><br/>"A fire?" asked Harding, much astonished at the reporter's<br/>words.<br/><br/>"We mean, captain," answered Pencroft, "that on board the<br/>'Bonadventure' we were very anxious during the few hours before our<br/>return, and we should have passed to windward of the island, if it<br/>had not been for the precaution you took of lighting a fire the<br/>night of the 19th of October, on Prospect Heights."<br/>
