<br/>"Very well, since the opportunity is lost, let us go on; it<br/>can't be helped," said Pencroft, who felt home-sickness for Granite<br/>House.<br/><br/>But just as they were rising, Top was heard loudly barking; and<br/>the dog issued from the wood, holding in his mouth a rag soiled<br/>with mud.<br/><br/>Neb seized it. It was a piece of strong cloth!<br/><br/>Top still barked, and by his going and coming, seemed to invite<br/>his master to follow him into the forest.<br/><br/>"Now there's something to explain the bullet!" exclaimed<br/>Pencroft.<br/><br/>"A castaway!" replied Herbert.<br/><br/>"Wounded, perhaps!" said Neb.<br/><br/>"Or dead!" added the reporter.<br/><br/>All ran after the dog, among the tall pines on the border of the<br/>forest. Harding and his companions made ready their firearms, in<br/>case of an emergency.<br/><br/>They advanced some way into the wood, but to their great<br/>disappointment, they as yet saw no signs of any human being having<br/>passed that way. Shrubs and creepers were uninjured, and they had<br/>even to cut them away with the axe, as they had done in the deepest<br/>recesses of the forest. It was difficult to fancy that any human<br/>creature had ever passed there, but yet Top went backward and<br/>forward, not like a dog who searches at random, but like a dog<br/>being endowed with a mind, who is following up an idea.<br/><br/>
