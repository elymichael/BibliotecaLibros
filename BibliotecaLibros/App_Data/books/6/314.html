In the meanwhile, the stranger had not reappeared. Several times<br/>Gideon Spilett and Herbert searched the forest in the neighborhood<br/>of Granite House, without meeting or finding any trace of him. They<br/>became seriously uneasy at this prolonged absence. Certainly, the<br/>former savage of Tabor island could not be perplexed how to live in<br/>the forest, abounding in game, but was it not to be feared that he<br/>had resumed his habits, and that this freedom would revive in him<br/>his wild instincts? However, Harding, by a sort of presentiment,<br/>doubtless, always persisted in saying that the fugitive would<br/>return.<br/><br/>"Yes, he will return!" he repeated with a confidence which his<br/>companions could not share. "When this unfortunate man was on Tabor<br/>Island, he knew himself to be alone! Here, he knows that fellow-men<br/>are awaiting him! Since he has partially spoken of his past life,<br/>the poor penitent will return to tell the whole, and from that day<br/>he will belong to us!"<br/><br/>The event justified Cyrus Harding's predictions. On the 3rd of<br/>December, Herbert had left the plateau to go and fish on the<br/>southern bank of the lake. He was unarmed, and till then had never<br/>taken any precautions for defense, as dangerous animals had not<br/>shown themselves on that part of the island.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Pencroft and Neb were working in the poultry-yard,<br/>while Harding and the reporter were occupied at the Chimneys in<br/>making soda, the store of soap being exhausted.<br/><br/>Suddenly cries resounded,â€”<br/><br/>"Help! help!"<br/><br/>Cyrus Harding and the reporter, being at too great a distance,<br/>had not been able to hear the shouts. Pencroft and Neb, leaving the<br/>poultry-yard in all haste, rushed towards the lake.<br/><br/>But before then, the stranger, whose presence at this place no<br/>one had suspected, crossed Creek Glycerine, which separated the<br/>plateau from the forest, and bounded up the opposite bank.<br/><br/>Herbert was there face to face with a fierce jaguar, similar to<br/>the one which had been killed on Reptile End. Suddenly surprised,<br/>he was standing with his back against a tree, while the animal<br/>gathering itself together was about to spring.<br/><br/>But the stranger, with no other weapon than a knife, rushed on<br/>the formidable animal, who turned to meet this new adversary.<br/><br/>The struggle was short. The stranger possessed immense strength<br/>and activity. He seized the jaguar's throat with one powerful hand,<br/>holding it as in a vise, without heeding the beast's claws which<br/>tore his flesh, and with the other he plunged his knife into its<br/>heart.<br/>
