Five days had passed when a partial clearing allowed them to see<br/>the wide extending ocean beneath their feet, now lashed into the<br/>maddest fury by the gale.<br/><br/>Our readers will recollect what befell these five daring<br/>individuals who set out on their hazardous expedition in the<br/>balloon on the 20th of March. Five days afterwards four of them<br/>were thrown on a desert coast, seven thousand miles from their<br/>country!
