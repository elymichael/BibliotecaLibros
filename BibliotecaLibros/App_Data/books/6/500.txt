"You consider yourselves, gentlemen, under some obligations to
me?"

"Captain, believe us that we would give our lives to prolong
yours."

"Promise, then," continued Captain Nemo, "to carry out my last
wishes, and I shall be repaid for all I have done for you."

"We promise," said Cyrus Harding.

And by this promise he bound both himself and his
companions.

"Gentlemen," resumed the captain, "to-morrow I shall be
dead."

Herbert was about to utter an exclamation, but a sign from the
captain arrested him.

"To-morrow I shall die, and I desire no other tomb than the
'Nautilus.' It is my grave! All my friends repose in the depths of
the ocean; their resting-place shall be mine."

These words were received with profound silence.

"Pay attention to my wishes," he continued. "The 'Nautilus' is
imprisoned in this grotto, the entrance of which is blocked up;
but, although egress is impossible, the vessel may at least sink in
the abyss, and there bury my remains."
