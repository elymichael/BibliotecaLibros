Gideon Spilett at last rose, after a long and attentive<br/>examination.<br/><br/>"He lives!" said he.<br/><br/>Pencroft knelt in his turn beside the engineer, he also heard a<br/>throbbing, and even felt a slight breath on his cheek.<br/><br/>Herbert at a word from the reporter ran out to look for water.<br/>He found, a hundred feet off, a limpid stream, which seemed to have<br/>been greatly increased by the rains, and which filtered through the<br/>sand; but nothing in which to put the water, not even a shell among<br/>the downs. The lad was obliged to content himself with dipping his<br/>handkerchief in the stream, and with it hastened back to the<br/>grotto.<br/><br/>Happily the wet handkerchief was enough for Gideon Spilett, who<br/>only wished to wet the engineer's lips. The cold water produced an<br/>almost immediate effect. His chest heaved and he seemed to try to<br/>speak.<br/><br/>"We will save him!" exclaimed the reporter.<br/><br/>At these words hope revived in Neb's heart. He undressed his<br/>master to see if he was wounded, but not so much as a bruise was to<br/>be found, either on the head, body, or limbs, which was surprising,<br/>as he must have been dashed against the rocks; even the hands were<br/>uninjured, and it was difficult to explain how the engineer showed<br/>no traces of the efforts which he must have made to get out of<br/>reach of the breakers.<br/><br/>But the explanation would come later. When Cyrus was able to<br/>speak he would say what had happened. For the present the question<br/>was, how to recall him to life, and it appeared likely that rubbing<br/>would bring this about; so they set to work with the sailor's<br/>jersey.<br/><br/>The engineer, revived by this rude shampooing, moved his arm<br/>slightly and began to breathe more regularly. He was sinking from<br/>exhaustion, and certainly, had not the reporter and his companions<br/>arrived, it would have been all over with Cyrus Harding.<br/><br/>"You thought your master was dead, didn't you?" said the seaman<br/>to Neb.<br/><br/>"Yes! quite dead!" replied Neb, "and if Top had not found you,<br/>and brought you here, I should have buried my master, and then have<br/>lain down on his grave to die!"<br/>
