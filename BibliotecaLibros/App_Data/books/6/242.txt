"Well, who knows," returned the reporter, "who knows but that we
may be much nearer inhabited land than we think?"

"We shall know to-morrow," replied Cyrus Harding, "and if it had
not been for the occupations which left me no leisure, we should
have known it already."

"Good!" said Pencroft. "The captain is too good an observer to
be mistaken, and, if it has not moved from its place, the island is
just where he put it."

"We shall see."

On the next day, therefore, by means of the sextant, the
engineer made the necessary observations to verify the position
which he had already obtained, and this was the result of his
operation. His first observation had given him the situation of
Lincoln Island,â€”

In west longitude: from 1500 to 1550;

In south latitude: from 300 to 350

The second gave exactly:

In longitude: 1500 30'

In south latitude: 340 57'

So then, notwithstanding the imperfection of his apparatus,
Cyrus Harding had operated with so much skill that his error did
not exceed five degrees.
