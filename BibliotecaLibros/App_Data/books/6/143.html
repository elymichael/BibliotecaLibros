There was no reply to be made to that, but the lad went on with<br/>his collection all the same, and it was well received at Granite<br/>House. Besides these medicinal herbs, he added a plant known in<br/>North America as "Oswego tea," which made an excellent<br/>beverage.<br/><br/>At last, by searching thoroughly, the hunters arrived at the<br/>real site of the warren. There the ground was perforated like a<br/>sieve.<br/><br/>"Here are the burrows!" cried Herbert.<br/><br/>"Yes," replied the reporter, "so I see."<br/><br/>"But are they inhabited?"<br/><br/>"That is the question."<br/><br/>This was soon answered. Almost immediately, hundreds of little<br/>animals, similar to rabbits, fled in every direction, with such<br/>rapidity that even Top could not overtake them. Hunters and dog ran<br/>in vain; these rodents escaped them easily. But the reporter<br/>resolved not to leave the place, until he had captured at least<br/>half-a-dozen of the quadrupeds. He wished to stock their larder<br/>first, and domesticate those which they might take later. It would<br/>not have been difficult to do this, with a few snares stretched at<br/>the openings of the burrows. But at this moment they had neither<br/>snares, nor anything to make them of. They must, therefore, be<br/>satisfied with visiting each hole, and rummaging in it with a<br/>stick, hoping by dint of patience to do what could not be done in<br/>any other way.<br/><br/>At last, after half an hour, four rodents were taken in their<br/>holes. They were similar to their European brethren, and are<br/>commonly known by the name of American rabbits.<br/><br/>This produce of the chase was brought back to Granite House, and<br/>figured at the evening repast. The tenants of the warren were not<br/>at all to be despised, for they were delicious. It was a valuable<br/>resource of the colony, and it appeared to be inexhaustible.<br/><br/>On the 31st of May the partitions were finished. The rooms had<br/>now only to be furnished, and this would be work for the long<br/>winter days. A chimney was established in the first room, which<br/>served as a kitchen. The pipe destined to conduct the smoke outside<br/>gave some trouble to these amateur bricklayers. It appeared<br/>simplest to Harding to make it of brick clay; as creating an outlet<br/>for it to the upper plateau was not to be thought of, a hole was<br/>pierced in the granite above the window of the kitchen, and the<br/>pipe met it like that of an iron stove. Perhaps the winds which<br/>blew directly against the facade would make the chimney smoke, but<br/>these winds were rare, and besides, Master Neb, the cook, was not<br/>so very particular about that.<br/><br/>When these interior arrangements were finished, the engineer<br/>occupied himself in blocking up the outlet by the lake, so as to<br/>prevent any access by that way. Masses of rock were rolled to the<br/>entrance and strongly cemented together. Cyrus Harding did not yet<br/>realize his plan of drowning this opening under the waters of the<br/>lake, by restoring them to their former level by means of a dam. He<br/>contented himself with hiding the obstruction with grass and<br/>shrubs, which were planted in the interstices of the rocks, and<br/>which next spring would sprout thickly. However, he used the<br/>waterfall so as to lead a small stream of fresh water to the new<br/>dwelling. A little trench, made below their level, produced this<br/>result; and this derivation from a pure and inexhaustible source<br/>yielded twenty-five or thirty gallons a day. There would never be<br/>any want of water at Granite House. At last all was finished, and<br/>it was time, for the bad season was near. Thick shutters closed the<br/>windows of the facade, until the engineer had time to make<br/>glass.<br/>
