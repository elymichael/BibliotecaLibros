<br/>"To-morrow, as soon as we have dug a hole for the mine, replied<br/>the engineer."<br/><br/>The next day, the 21st of May, at daybreak, the miners went to<br/>the point which formed the eastern shore of Lake Grant, and was<br/>only five hundred feet from the coast. At this place, the plateau<br/>inclined downwards from the waters, which were only restrained by<br/>their granite case. Therefore, if this case was broken, the water<br/>would escape by the opening and form a stream, which, flowing over<br/>the inclined surface of the plateau, would rush on to the beach.<br/>Consequently, the level of the lake would be greatly lowered, and<br/>the opening where the water escaped would be exposed, which was<br/>their final aim.<br/><br/>Under the engineer's directions, Pencroft, armed with a pickaxe,<br/>which he handled skillfully and vigorously, attacked the granite.<br/>The hole was made on the point of the shore, slanting, so that it<br/>should meet a much lower level than that of the water of the lake.<br/>In this way the explosive force, by scattering the rock, would open<br/>a large place for the water to rush out.<br/><br/>The work took some time, for the engineer, wishing to produce a<br/>great effect, intended to devote not less than seven quarts of<br/>nitro-glycerine to the operation. But Pencroft, relieved by Neb,<br/>did so well, that towards four o'clock in the evening, the mine was<br/>finished.<br/><br/>Now the question of setting fire to the explosive substance was<br/>raised. Generally, nitro-glycerine is ignited by caps of fulminate,<br/>which in bursting cause the explosion. A shock is therefore needed<br/>to produce the explosion, for, simply lighted, this substance would<br/>burn without exploding.<br/><br/>Cyrus Harding could certainly have fabricated a percussion cap.<br/>In default of fulminate, he could easily obtain a substance similar<br/>to guncotton, since he had azotic acid at his disposal. This<br/>substance, pressed in a cartridge, and introduced among the<br/>nitro-glycerine, would burst by means of a fuse, and cause the<br/>explosion.<br/><br/>But Cyrus Harding knew that nitro-glycerine would explode by a<br/>shock. He resolved to employ this means, and try another way, if<br/>this did not succeed.<br/><br/>In fact, the blow of a hammer on a few drops of nitro-glycerine,<br/>spread out on a hard surface, was enough to create an explosion.<br/>But the operator could not be there to give the blow, without<br/>becoming a victim to the operation. Harding, therefore, thought of<br/>suspending a mass of iron, weighing several pounds, by means of a<br/>fiber, to an upright just above the mine. Another long fiber,<br/>previously impregnated with sulphur, was attached to the middle of<br/>the first, by one end, while the other lay on the ground several<br/>feet distant from the mine. The second fiber being set on fire, it<br/>would burn till it reached the first. This catching fire in its<br/>turn, would break, and the mass of iron would fall on the<br/>nitro-glycerine. This apparatus being then arranged, the engineer,<br/>after having sent his companions to a distance, filled the hole, so<br/>that the nitro-glycerine was on a level with the opening; then he<br/>threw a few drops of it on the surface of the rock, above which the<br/>mass of iron was already suspended.<br/><br/>This done, Harding lit the end of the sulphured fiber, and<br/>leaving the place, he returned with his companions to the<br/>Chimneys.<br/><br/>The fiber was intended to burn five and twenty minutes, and, in<br/>fact, five and twenty minutes afterwards a most tremendous<br/>explosion was heard. The island appeared to tremble to its very<br/>foundation. Stones were projected in the air as if by the eruption<br/>of a volcano. The shock produced by the displacing of the air was<br/>such, that the rocks of the Chimneys shook. The settlers, although<br/>they were more than two miles from the mine, were thrown on the<br/>ground.<br/><br/>
