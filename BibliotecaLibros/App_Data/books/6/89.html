Top was recalled by a slight whistle from his master, and the<br/>latter, signing to his companions to wait for him, glided away<br/>among the rocks. The colonists, motionless, anxiously awaited the<br/>result of this exploration, when a shout from the engineer made<br/>them hasten forward. They soon joined him, and were at once struck<br/>with a disagreeable odor which impregnated the atmosphere.<br/><br/>The odor, easily recognized, was enough for the engineer to<br/>guess what the smoke was which at first, not without cause, had<br/>startled him.<br/><br/>"This fue," said he, "or rather, this smoke is produced by<br/>nature alone. There is a sulphur spring there, which will cure all<br/>our sore throats."<br/><br/>"Captain!" cried Pencroft. "What a pity that I haven't got a<br/>cold!"<br/><br/>The settlers then directed their steps towards the place from<br/>which the smoke escaped. They there saw a sulphur spring which<br/>flowed abundantly between the rocks, and its waters discharged a<br/>strong sulphuric acid odor, after having absorbed the oxygen of the<br/>air.<br/><br/>Cyrus Harding, dipping in his hand, felt the water oily to the<br/>touch. He tasted it and found it rather sweet. As to its<br/>temperature, that he estimated at ninety-five degrees Fahrenheit.<br/>Herbert having asked on what he based this calculation,â€”<br/><br/>"Its quite simple, my boy," said he, "for, in plunging my hand<br/>into the water, I felt no sensation either of heat or cold.<br/>Therefore it has the same temperature as the human body, which is<br/>about ninety-five degrees."<br/><br/>The sulphur spring not being of any actual use to the settlers,<br/>they proceeded towards the thick border of the forest, which began<br/>some hundred paces off.<br/><br/>There, as they had conjectured, the waters of the stream flowed<br/>clear and limpid between high banks of red earth, the color of<br/>which betrayed the presence of oxide of iron. From this color, the<br/>name of Red Creek was immediately given to the watercourse.<br/><br/>It was only a large stream, deep and clear, formed of the<br/>mountain water, which, half river, half torrent, here rippling<br/>peacefully over the sand, there falling against the rocks or<br/>dashing down in a cascade, ran towards the lake, over a distance of<br/>a mile and a half, its breadth varying from thirty to forty feet.<br/>Its waters were sweet, and it was supposed that those of the lake<br/>were so also. A fortunate circumstance, in the event of their<br/>finding on its borders a more suitable dwelling than the<br/>Chimneys.<br/><br/>As to the trees, which some hundred feet downwards shaded the<br/>banks of the creek, they belonged, for the most part, to the<br/>species which abound in the temperate zone of America and Tasmania,<br/>and no longer to those coniferae observed in that portion of the<br/>island already explored to some miles from Prospect Heights. At<br/>this time of the year, the commencement of the month of April,<br/>which represents the month of October, in this hemisphere, that is,<br/>the beginning of autumn, they were still in full leaf. They<br/>consisted principally of casuarinas and eucalypti, some of which<br/>next year would yield a sweet manna, similar to the manna of the<br/>East. Clumps of Australian cedars rose on the sloping banks, which<br/>were also covered with the high grass called "tussac" in New<br/>Holland; but the cocoanut, so abundant in the archipelagoes of the<br/>Pacific, seemed to be wanting in the island, the latitude,<br/>doubtless, being too low.<br/>
