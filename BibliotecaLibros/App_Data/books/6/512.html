"How so, my dear Cyrus?'<br/><br/>"I am not certain. I must consider. I must visit the mountain.<br/>In a few days I shall learn more on this point."<br/><br/>Gideon Spilett said no more, and soon, in spite of the<br/>explosions of the volcano, whose intensity increased, and which<br/>were repeated by the echoes of the island, the inhabitants of<br/>Granite House were sleeping soundly.<br/><br/>Three days passed by—the 4th, 5th, and 6th of January. The<br/>construction of the vessel was diligently continued, and without<br/>offering further explanations the engineer pushed forward the work<br/>with all his energy. Mount Franklin was now hooded by a somber<br/>cloud of sinister aspect, and, amid the flames, vomiting forth<br/>incandescent rocks, some of which fell back into the crater itself.<br/>This caused Pencroft, who would only look at the matter in the<br/>light of a joke, to exclaim,—<br/><br/>"Ah! the giant is playing at cup and ball; he is a<br/>conjurer."<br/><br/>In fact, the substances thrown up fell back again in to the<br/>abyss, and it did not seem that the lava, though swollen by the<br/>internal pressure, had yet risen to the orifice of the crater. At<br/>any rate, the opening on the northeast, which was partly visible,<br/>poured out no torrent upon the northern slope of the mountain.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, however pressing was the construction of the<br/>vessel, other duties demanded the presence of the colonists on<br/>various portions of the island. Before everything it was necessary<br/>to go to the corral, where the flocks of musmons and goats were<br/>enclosed, and replenish the provision of forage for those animals.<br/>It was accordingly arranged that Ayrton should proceed thither the<br/>next day, the 7th of January; and as he was sufficient for the<br/>task, to which he was accustomed, Pencroft and the rest were<br/>somewhat surprised on hearing the engineer say to Ayrton—<br/><br/>"As you are going to-morrow to the corral I will accompany<br/>you."<br/><br/>"But, Captain Harding," exclaimed the sailor, "our working days<br/>will not be many, and if you go also we shall be two pair of hands<br/>short!"<br/><br/>"We shall return to-morrow," replied Cyrus Harding, "but it is<br/>necessary that I should go to the corral. I must learn how the<br/>eruption is progressing."<br/><br/>"The eruption! always the eruption!" answered Pencroft, with an<br/>air of discontent. "An important thing, truly, this eruption! I<br/>trouble myself very little about it."<br/>
