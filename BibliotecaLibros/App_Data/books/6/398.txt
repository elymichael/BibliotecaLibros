"Try them, Pencroft," replied the engineer. "However, I think
that in making the experiment, we ought to employ, not the ordinary
powder, the supply of which, I think, should remain untouched, but
the pyroxyle which will never fail us."

"Can the cannon support the shock of the pyroxyle?" asked the
reporter, who was not less anxious than Pencroft to try the
artillery of Granite House.

"I believe so. However," added the engineer, "we will be
prudent." The engineer was right in thinking that the guns were of
excellent make. Made of forged steel, and breech-loaders, they
ought consequently to be able to bear a considerable charge, and
also have an enormous range. In fact, as regards practical effect,
the transit described by the ball ought to be as extended as
possible, and this tension could only be obtained under the
condition that the projectile should be impelled with a very great
initial velocity.

"Now," said Harding to his companions, "the initial velocity is
in proportion to the quantity of powder used. In the fabrication of
these pieces, everything depends on employing a metal with the
highest possible power of resistance, and steel is incontestably
that metal of all others which resists the best. I have, therefore,
reason to believe that our guns will bear without risk the
expansion of the pyroxyle gas, and will give excellent
results."

"We shall be a great deal more certain of that when we have
tried them!" answered Pencroft.

It is unnecessary to say that the four cannons were in perfect
order. Since they had been taken from the water, the sailor had
bestowed great care upon them. How many hours he had spent, in
rubbing, greasing, and polishing them, and in cleaning the
mechanism! And now the pieces were as brilliant as if they had been
on board a frigate of the United States Navy.

On this day, therefore, in presence of all the members of the
colony, including Master Jup and Top, the four cannon were
successively tried. They were charged with pyroxyle, taking into
consideration its explosive power, which, as has been said, is four
times that of ordinary powder: the projectile to be fired was
cylindroconic.

Pencroft, holding the end of the quick-match, stood ready to
fire.

At Harding's signal, he fired. The shot, passing over the islet,
fell into the sea at a distance which could not be calculated with
exactitude.

The second gun was pointed at the rocks at the end of Flotsam
Point, and the shot striking a sharp rock nearly three miles from
Granite House, made it fly into splinters. It was Herbert who had
pointed this gun and fired it, and very proud he was of his first
shot. Pencroft only was prouder than he! Such a shot, the honor of
which belonged to his dear boy.

The third shot, aimed this time at the downs forming the upper
side of Union Bay, struck the sand at a distance of four miles,
then having ricocheted: was lost in the sea in a cloud of
spray.
