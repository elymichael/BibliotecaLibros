"By that lazy balloon which is left there doing nothing, and<br/>which looks to me as if it was waiting on purpose for us—"<br/><br/>There was no necessity for the sailor to finish his sentence.<br/>The engineer understood him at once. He seized Pencroft by the arm,<br/>and dragged him to his house. There the sailor developed his<br/>project, which was indeed extremely simple. They risked nothing but<br/>their lives in its execution. The hurricane was in all its<br/>violence, it is true, but so clever and daring an engineer as Cyrus<br/>Harding knew perfectly well how to manage a balloon. Had he himself<br/>been as well acquainted with the art of sailing in the air as he<br/>was with the navigation of a ship, Pencroft would not have<br/>hesitated to set out, of course taking his young friend Herbert<br/>with him; for, accustomed to brave the fiercest tempests of the<br/>ocean, he was not to be hindered on account of the hurricane.<br/><br/>Captain Harding had listened to the sailor without saying a<br/>word, but his eyes shone with satisfaction. Here was the<br/>long-sought-for opportunity—he was not a man to let it pass. The<br/>plan was feasible, though, it must be confessed, dangerous in the<br/>extreme. In the night, in spite of their guards, they might<br/>approach the balloon, slip into the car, and then cut the cords<br/>which held it. There was no doubt that they might be killed, but on<br/>the other hand they might succeed, and without this storm!—Without<br/>this storm the balloon would have started already and the<br/>looked-for opportunity would not have then presented itself.<br/><br/>"I am not alone!" said Harding at last.<br/><br/>"How many people do you wish to bring with you?" asked the<br/>sailor.<br/><br/>"Two; my friend Spilett, and my servant Neb."<br/><br/>"That will be three," replied Pencroft; "and with Herbert and me<br/>five. But the balloon will hold six—"<br/><br/>"That will be enough, we will go," answered Harding in a firm<br/>voice.<br/><br/>This "we" included Spilett, for the reporter, as his friend well<br/>knew, was not a man to draw back, and when the project was<br/>communicated to him he approved of it unreservedly. What astonished<br/>him was, that so simple an idea had not occurred to him before. As<br/>to Neb, he followed his master wherever his master wished to<br/>go.<br/><br/>"This evening, then," said Pencroft, "we will all meet out<br/>there."<br/><br/>"This evening, at ten o'clock," replied Captain Harding; "and<br/>Heaven grant that the storm does not abate before our<br/>departure."<br/>
