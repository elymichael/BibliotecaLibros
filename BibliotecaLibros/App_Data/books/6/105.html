At half-past eight the little band was following the edge of the<br/>channel. On the other side, on Safety Islet, numerous birds were<br/>gravely strutting. They were divers, easily recognized by their<br/>cry, which much resembles the braying of a donkey. Pencroft only<br/>considered them in an eatable point of view, and learnt with some<br/>satisfaction that their flesh, though blackish, is not bad<br/>food.<br/><br/>Great amphibious creatures could also be seen crawling on the<br/>sand; seals, doubtless, who appeared to have chosen the islet for a<br/>place of refuge. It was impossible to think of those animals in an<br/>alimentary point of view, for their oily flesh is detestable;<br/>however, Cyrus Harding observed them attentively, and without<br/>making known his idea, he announced to his companions that very<br/>soon they would pay a visit to the islet. The beach was strewn with<br/>innumerable shells, some of which would have rejoiced the heart of<br/>a conchologist; there were, among others, the phasianella, the<br/>terebratual, etc. But what would be of more use, was the discovery,<br/>by Neb, at low tide, of a large oysterbed among the rocks, nearly<br/>five miles from the Chimneys.<br/><br/>"Neb will not have lost his day," cried Pencroft, looking at the<br/>spacious oyster-bed.<br/><br/>"It is really a fortunate discovery," said the reporter, "and as<br/>it is said that each oyster produces yearly from fifty to sixty<br/>thousand eggs, we shall have an inexhaustible supply there."<br/><br/>"Only I believe that the oyster is not very nourishing," said<br/>Herbert.<br/><br/>"No," replied Harding. "The oyster contains very little<br/>nitrogen, and if a man lived exclusively on them, he would have to<br/>eat not less than fifteen to sixteen dozen a day."<br/><br/>"Capital!" replied Pencroft. "We might swallow dozens and dozens<br/>without exhausting the bed. Shall we take some for breakfast?"<br/><br/>And without waiting for a reply to this proposal, knowing that<br/>it would be approved of, the sailor and Neb detached a quantity of<br/>the molluscs. They put them in a sort of net of hibiscus fiber,<br/>which Neb had manufactured, and which already contained food; they<br/>then continued to climb the coast between the downs and the<br/>sea.<br/><br/>From time to time Harding consulted his watch, so as to be<br/>prepared in time for the solar observation, which had to be made<br/>exactly at midday.<br/><br/>All that part of the island was very barren as far as the point<br/>which closed Union Bay, and which had received the name of Cape<br/>South Mandible. Nothing could be seen there but sand and shells,<br/>mingled with debris of lava. A few sea-birds frequented this<br/>desolate coast, gulls, great albatrosses, as well as wild duck, for<br/>which Pencroft had a great fancy. He tried to knock some over with<br/>an arrow, but without result, for they seldom perched, and he could<br/>not hit them on the wing.<br/><br/>This led the sailor to repeat to the engineer,â€”<br/>
