Between the place occupied by the colonists and the other side
of the immense bay, the shore was composed, first, of a tract of
low land, bordered in the background by trees; then the shore
became more irregular, projecting sharp points into the sea, and
finally ended in the black rocks which, accumulated in picturesque
disorder, formed Claw Cape.

Such was the development of this part of the island, which the
settlers took in at a glance, while stopping for an instant.

"If a vessel ran in here," said Pencroft, "she would certainly
be lost. Sandbanks and reefs everywhere! Bad quarters!"

"But at least something would be left of the ship," observed the
reporter.

"There might be pieces of wood on the rocks, but nothing on the
sands," replied the sailor.

"Why?"

"Because the sands are still more dangerous than the rocks, for
they swallow up everything that is thrown on them. In a few days
the hull of a ship of several hundred tons would disappear entirely
in there!"

"So, Pencroft," asked the engineer, "if a ship has been wrecked
on these banks, is it not astonishing that there is now no trace of
her remaining?"

"No, captain, with the aid of time and tempest. However, it
would be surprising, even in this case, that some of the masts or
spars should not have been thrown on the beach, out of reach of the
waves."

"Let us go on with our search, then," returned Cyrus
Harding.

At one o'clock the colonists arrived at the other side of
Washington Bay, they having now gone a distance of twenty
miles.
