There was no longer any doubt as to the pirates' intentions.
They had dropped anchor at a short distance from the island, and it
was evident that the next day by means of their boats they purposed
to land on the beach!

Cyrus Harding and his companions were ready to act, but,
determined though they were, they must not forget to be prudent.
Perhaps their presence might still be concealed in the event of the
pirates contenting themselves with landing on the shore without
examining the interior of the island. It might be, indeed, that
their only intention was to obtain fresh water from the Mercy, and
it was not impossible that the bridge, thrown across a mile and a
half from the mouth, and the manufactory at the Chimneys might
escape their notice.

But why was that flag hoisted at the brig's peak? What was that
shot fired for? Pure bravado doubtless, unless it was a sign of the
act of taking possession. Harding knew now that the vessel was well
armed. And what had the colonists of Lincoln Island to reply to the
pirates' guns? A few muskets only.

"However," observed Cyrus Harding, "here we are in an
impregnable position. The enemy cannot discover the mouth of the
outlet, now that it is hidden under reeds and grass, and
consequently it would be impossible for them to penetrate into
Granite House."

"But our plantations, our poultry-yard, our corral, all,
everything!" exclaimed Pencroft, stamping his foot. "They may spoil
everything, destroy everything in a few hours!"

"Everything, Pencroft," answered Harding, "and we have no means
of preventing them."
