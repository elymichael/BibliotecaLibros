United
States public domain tag
&#160;to indicate why this work is in
the public domain in the United States. Note that a few countries
have copyright terms longer than 70 years: Mexico has 100 years,
Colombia has 80 years, and Guatemala and Samoa have 75 years,
Russia has 74 years for some authors. This image
may&#160;
not
&#160;be in the public domain in these
countries, which moreover do&#160;
not
&#160;implement
the&#160;
rule of the
shorter term
. CÃ´te d'Ivoire has a general copyright term of 99
years and Honduras has 75 years, but
they&#160;
do
&#160;implement the rule of the shorter
term.
