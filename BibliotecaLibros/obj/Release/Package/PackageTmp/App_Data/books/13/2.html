<br/><br/>About Ball:<br/><br/>Sir Robert Stawell Ball, Fellow of The Royal Society, (1 July<br/>1840, Dublin â€“ 25 November 1913, Cambridge) was an Irish<br/>astronomer. He worked for Lord Rosse from 1865 to 1867. In 1867 he<br/>became Professor of Applied Mathematics at the Royal College of<br/>Science in Dublin. In 1874 Ball was appointed Royal Astronomer of<br/>Ireland and Andrews Professor of Astronomy in the University of<br/>Dublin at Dunsink Observatory.[1] In 1892 he was appointed Lowndean<br/>Professor of Astronomy and Geometry at Cambridge University at the<br/>same time becoming director of the Cambridge Observatory. His<br/>lectures, articles, and books (e.g.<br/>Starland<br/>and<br/>The<br/>Story of the Heavens<br/>) were mostly popular and simple in style.<br/>However, he also published books on mathematical astronomy such as<br/>A Treatise on Spherical Astronomy<br/>. His main interest was<br/>mathematics and he devoted much of his spare time to his "Screw<br/>theory". He served for a time as President of the Quaternion<br/>Society. His work<br/>The Story of the Heavens<br/>is mentioned in<br/>the "Lestrygonians" chapter of James Joyce's<br/>Ulysses<br/>. He<br/>was the son of naturalist Robert Ball and Amelia Gresley Hellicar.<br/>(Biography from Wikpedia:<br/>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Stawell_Ball)<br/><br/><br/>Also available on Feedbooks<br/>Ball:<br/><br/><br/>Great Astronomers:<br/>Isaac Newton<br/>(1907)<br/>
