<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>2<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>&#160;Copernicus having established a theory of the celestial<br/>movements which deliberately set aside the stability of the earth,<br/>it seemed natural that he should inquire whether the doctrine of a<br/>moving earth might not remove the difficulties presented in other<br/>celestial phenomena. It had been universally admitted that the<br/>earth lay unsupported in space. Copernicus had further shown that<br/>it possessed a movement of rotation. Its want of stability being<br/>thus recognised, it seemed reasonable to suppose that the earth<br/>might also have some other kinds of movements as well. In this,<br/>Copernicus essayed to solve a problem far more difficult than that<br/>which had hitherto occupied his attention. It was a comparatively<br/>easy task to show how the diurnal rising and setting could be<br/>accounted for by the rotation, of the earth. It was a much more<br/>difficult undertaking to demonstrate that the planetary movements,<br/>which Ptolemy had represented with so much success, could be<br/>completely explained by the supposition that each of those planets<br/>revolved uniformly round the sun, and that the earth was also a<br/>planet, accomplishing a complete circuit of the sun once in the<br/>course of a year.<br/><br/>It would be impossible in a sketch like the present to enter<br/>into any detail as to the geometrical propositions on which this<br/>beautiful investigation of Copernicus depended. We can only mention<br/>a few of the leading principles. It may be laid down in general<br/>that, if an observer is in movement, he will, if unconscious of the<br/>fact, attribute to the fixed objects around him a movement equal<br/>and opposite to that which he actually possesses. A passenger on a<br/>canal-boat sees the objects on the banks apparently moving backward<br/>with a speed equal to that by which he is himself advancing<br/>forwards. By an application of this principle, we can account for<br/>all the phenomena of the movements of the planets, which Ptolemy<br/>had so ingeniously represented by his circles. Let us take, for<br/>instance, the most characteristic feature in. the irregularities of<br/>the outer planets. We have already remarked that Mars, though<br/>generally advancing from west to east among the stars, occasionally<br/>pauses, retraces his steps for a while, again pauses, and then<br/>resumes his ordinary onward progress. Copernicus showed clearly how<br/>this effect was produced by the real motion of the earth, combined<br/>with the real motion of Mars. In the adjoining figure we represent<br/>a portion of the circular tracks in which the earth and Mars move<br/>in accordance with the Copernican doctrine. I show particularly the<br/>case where the earth comes directly between the planet and the sun,<br/>because it is on such occasions that the retrograde movement (for<br/>so this backward movement of Mars is termed) is at its highest.<br/>Mars is then advancing in the direction shown by the arrow-head,<br/>and the earth is also advancing in the same direction. We, on the<br/>earth, however, being unconscious of our own motion, attribute, by<br/>the principle I have already explained, an equal and opposite<br/>motion to Mars. The visible effect upon the planet is, that Mars<br/>has two movements, a real onward movement in one direction, and an<br/>apparent movement in the opposite direction. If it so happened that<br/>the earth was moving with the same speed as Mars, then the apparent<br/>movement would exactly neutralise the real movement, and Mars would<br/>seem to be at rest relatively to the surrounding stars. Under the<br/>actual circumstances represented, however, the earth is moving<br/>faster than Mars, and the consequence is, that the apparent<br/>movement of the planet backwards exceeds the real movement<br/>forwards, the net result being an apparent retrograde movement.<br/><br/>With consummate skill, Copernicus showed how the applications of<br/>the same principles could account for the characteristic movements<br/>of the planets. His reasoning in due time bore down all opposition.<br/>The supreme importance of the earth in the system vanished. It had<br/>now merely to take rank as one of the planets. The same great<br/>astronomer now, for the first time, rendered something like a<br/>rational account of the changes of the seasons. Nor did certain of<br/>the more obscure astronomical phenomena escape his attention.<br/><br/>He delayed publishing his wonderful discoveries to the world<br/>until he was quite an old man. He had a well-founded apprehension<br/>of the storm of opposition which they would arouse.<br/>[3]<br/>However, he yielded at last to the<br/>entreaties of his friends, and his book was sent to the press. But<br/>ere it made its appearance to the world, Copernicus was seized by<br/>mortal illness. A copy of the book was brought to him on May 23,<br/>1543. We are told that he was able to see it and to touch it, but<br/>no more, and he died a few hours afterwards. He was buried in that<br/>Cathedral of Frauenburg, with which his life had been so closely<br/>associated.<br/><br/><br/><br/>
