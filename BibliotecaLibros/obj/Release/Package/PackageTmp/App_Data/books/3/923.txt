And rived his skull; with thundering sound he fell,
And thus the conqueror gloried in his fall.

&#160;

Ah Otryntides! thou art slain. Here lies
The terrible in arms, who born beside
The broad Gyg√¶an lake, where Hyllus flows
And Hermus, call'd the fertile soil his own.

Thus gloried he. Meantime the shades of death
Cover'd Iphition, and Achaian wheels
And horses ground his body in the van.
Demoleon next, Antenor's son, a brave
Defender of the walls of Troy, he slew.
Into his temples through his brazen casque
He thrust the Pelian ash, nor could the brass
Such force resist, but the huge weapon drove
The shatter'd bone into his inmost brain,
