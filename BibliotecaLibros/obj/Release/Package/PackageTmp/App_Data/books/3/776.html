&#160;<br/><br/>To whom brave Hector, frowning stern, replied,<br/>Why, Glaucus! should a Chief like thee his tongue<br/>Presume to employ thus haughtily? My friend!<br/>I thee accounted wisest, once, of all<br/>Who dwell in fruitful Lycia, but thy speech<br/>Now utter'd altogether merits blame,<br/>In which thou tell'st me that I fear to stand<br/>Against vast Ajax. Know that I from fight<br/>Shrink not, nor yet from sound of prancing steeds;<br/>But Jove's high purpose evermore prevails<br/>Against the thoughts of man; he turns to flight<br/>The bravest, and the victory takes with ease<br/>Even from those whom once he favor'd most.<br/>But hither, friend! stand with me; mark my deed;<br/>Prove me, if I be found, as thou hast said,<br/>An idler all the day, or if by force<br/>I not compel some Grecian to renounce<br/>Patroclus, even the boldest of them all.<br/><br/>
