<br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Gods! Goddesses! Inhabitants of heaven!<br/>Attend; I make my secret purpose known.<br/>Let neither God nor Goddess interpose<br/>My counsel to rescind, but with one heart<br/>Approve it, that it reach, at once, its end.<br/>Whom I shall mark soever from the rest<br/>Withdrawn, that he may Greeks or Trojans aid,<br/>Disgrace shall find him; shamefully chastised<br/>He shall return to the Olympian heights,<br/>Or I will hurl him deep into the gulfs<br/>Of gloomy Tartarus, where Hell shuts fast<br/>Her iron gates, and spreads her brazen floor,<br/>As far below the shades, as earth from heaven.<br/>There shall he learn how far I pass in might<br/>All others; which if ye incline to doubt<br/>Now prove me. Let ye down the golden chain<br/>From heaven, and at its nether links pull all,<br/>Both Goddesses and Gods. But me your King,<br/>
