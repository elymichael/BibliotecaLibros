He, conscious, with heroic joy the lot<br/>Cast at his foot, and thus exclaim'd aloud.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>My friends! the lot is mine,&#160;and my own heart<br/>Rejoices also; for I nothing doubt<br/>That noble Hector shall be foil'd by me.<br/>But while I put mine armor on, pray all<br/>In silence to the King Saturnian Jove,<br/>Lest, while ye pray, the Trojans overhear.<br/>Or pray aloud, for whom have we to dread?<br/>No man shall my firm standing by his strength<br/>Unsettle, or for ignorance of mine<br/>Me vanquish, who, I hope, brought forth and train'd<br/>In Salamis, have, now, not much to learn.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>He ended. They with heaven-directed eyes<br/>The King in prayer address'd, Saturnian Jove.<br/>
