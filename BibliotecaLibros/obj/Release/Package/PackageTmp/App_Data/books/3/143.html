<br/>All-glorious Jove, and ye the powers of heaven,<br/>Whoso shall violate this contract first,<br/>So be the brains of them and of their sons<br/>Pour'd out, as we this wine pour on the earth,<br/>And may their wives bring forth to other men!<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>So they: but them Jove heard not. Then arose<br/>Priam, the son of Dardanus, and said,<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Hear me, ye Trojans and ye Greeks well-arm'd.<br/>Hence back to wind-swept Ilium I return,<br/>Unable to sustain the sight, my son<br/>With warlike Menela√ºs match'd in arms.<br/>Jove knows, and the immortal Gods, to whom<br/>Of both, this day is preordain'd the last.<br/><br/>
