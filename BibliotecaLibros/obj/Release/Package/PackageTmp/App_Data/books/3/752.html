Who, then, Patroclus! first, who last by thee<br/>Fell slain, what time thyself was call'd to die?<br/>Adrastus first, then Perimus he slew,<br/>Offspring of Megas, then Autono√ºs,<br/>Echechlus, Melanippus, and Epistor,<br/>Pylartes, Mulius, Elasus. All these<br/>He slew, and from the field chased all beside.<br/>Then, doubtless, had Achaia's sons prevail'd<br/>To take proud-gated Troy, such havoc made<br/>He with his spear, but that the son of Jove<br/>Apollo, on a tower's conspicuous height<br/>Station'd, devoted him for Ilium's sake.<br/>Thrice on a buttress of the lofty wall<br/>Patroclus mounted, and him thrice the God<br/>With hands immortal his resplendent shield<br/>Smiting, struck down again; but when he rush'd<br/>A fourth time, demon-like, to the assault,<br/>The King of radiant shafts him, stern, rebuked.<br/><br/>Patroclus, warrior of renown, retire!<br/>The fates ordain not that imperial Troy<br/>
