ARGUMENT OF THE SIXTH BOOK.

The battle is continued. The Trojans being closely pursued,
Hector by the advice of Helenus enters Troy, and recommends it to
Hecuba to go in solemn procession to the temple of Minerva; she
with the matrons goes accordingly. Hector takes the opportunity to
find out Paris, and exhorts him to return to the field of battle.
An interview succeeds between Hector and Andromache, and Paris,
having armed himself in the mean time, comes up with Hector at the
close of it, when they sally from the gate together.

&#160;


Thus was the field forsaken by the Gods.
And now success proved various; here the Greeks
With their extended spears, the Trojans there
Prevail'd alternate, on the champain spread
The Xanthus and the Simo√Øs between.
