The fat acceptable of bulls or goats,<br/>Grant my petition. With thy shafts avenge<br/>On the Achaian host thy servant's tears.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Such prayer he made, and it was heard.&#160;The God,<br/>Down from Olympus with his radiant bow<br/>And his full quiver o'er his shoulder slung,<br/>Marched in his anger; shaken as he moved<br/>His rattling arrows told of his approach.<br/>Gloomy he came as night; sat from the ships<br/>Apart, and sent an arrow. Clang'd the cord<br/>Dread-sounding, bounding on the silver bow.<br/>Mules first and dogs he struck,&#160;but at themselves<br/>Dispatching soon his bitter arrows keen,<br/>Smote them. Death-piles on all sides always blazed.<br/>Nine days throughout the camp his arrows flew;<br/>The tenth, Achilles from all parts convened<br/>The host in council. Juno the white-armed<br/>Moved at the sight of Grecians all around<br/>
