Jove's daughter, Helen, fear'd,<br/>And, in her lucid veil close wrapt around,<br/>Silent retired, of all those Trojan dames<br/>Unseen, and Venus led, herself, the way.<br/>Soon then as Alexander's fair abode<br/>They reach'd, her maidens quick their tasks resumed,<br/>And she to her own chamber lofty-roof'd<br/>Ascended, loveliest of her sex. A seat<br/>For Helen, daughter of Jove Ægis-arm'd,<br/>To Paris opposite, the Queen of smiles<br/>Herself disposed; but with averted eyes<br/>She sat before him, and him keen reproach'd.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Thou hast escaped.—Ah would that thou hadst died<br/>By that heroic arm, mine husband's erst!<br/>Thou once didst vaunt thee in address and strength<br/>Superior. Go then—challenge yet again<br/>
