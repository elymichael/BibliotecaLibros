Of this his offer, all the treasured heaps<br/>Which he possesses, or shall yet possess,<br/>All that Orchomenos within her walls,<br/>And all that opulent Egyptian Thebes<br/>Receives, the city with a hundred gates,<br/>Whence twenty thousand chariots rush to war,<br/>And would he give me riches as the sands,<br/>And as the dust of earth, no gifts from him<br/>Should soothe me, till my soul were first avenged<br/>For all the offensive license of his tongue.<br/>I will not wed the daughter of your Chief,<br/>Of Agamemnon. Could she vie in charms<br/>With golden Venus, had she all the skill<br/>Of blue-eyed Pallas, even so endow'd<br/>She were no bride for me. No. He may choose<br/>From the Achaians some superior Prince,<br/>One more her equal. Peleus, if the Gods<br/>Preserve me, and I safe arrive at home,<br/>Himself, ere long, shall mate me with a bride.<br/>In Hellas and in Phthia may be found<br/>Fair damsels many, daughters of the Chiefs<br/>
