Ye leaders of the well-appointed Greeks,<br/>The son of noble Peteos calls; he begs<br/>With instant suit, that ye would share his toils,<br/>However short your stay; the aid of both<br/>Will serve him best, for havoc threatens there<br/>The Lycian leaders, ever in assault<br/>Tempestuous, bend their force toward the tower<br/>His station. But if also here ye find<br/>Laborious conflict pressing you severe,<br/>At least let Telamonian Ajax come,<br/>And Teucer with his death-dispensing bow.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>He spake, nor his request the towering son<br/>Of Telamon denied, but quick his speech<br/>To Ajax OÃ¯liades address'd.<br/><br/>Ajax! abiding here, exhort ye both<br/>(Heroic Lycomedes and thyself)<br/>The Greeks to battle. Thither I depart<br/>
