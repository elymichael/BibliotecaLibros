Then all the might of Atreus' royal son.<br/>As when a laboring woman's arrowy throes<br/>Seize her intense, by Juno's daughters dread<br/>The birth-presiding Ilithyæ deep<br/>Infixt, dispensers of those pangs severe;<br/>So, anguish insupportable subdued<br/>Then all the might of Atreus' royal son.<br/>Up-springing to his seat, instant he bade<br/>His charioteer drive to the hollow barks,<br/>Heart-sick himself with pain; yet, ere he went,<br/>With voice loud-echoing hail'd the Danaï.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Friends! counsellors and leaders of the Greeks!<br/>Now drive, yourselves, the battle from your ships.<br/>For me the Gods permit not to employ<br/>In fight with Ilium's host the day entire.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>
