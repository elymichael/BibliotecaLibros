Oppress'd, then oped the gates, thrust back the bars,<br/>And introduced, with all his litter-load<br/>Of costly gifts, the venerable King.<br/>But when they reached the tent for Peleus' son<br/>Raised by the Myrmidons (with trunks of pine<br/>They built it, lopping smooth the boughs away,<br/>Then spread with shaggy mowings of the mead<br/>Its lofty roof, and with a spacious court<br/>Surrounded it, all fenced with driven stakes;<br/>One bar alone of pine secured the door,<br/>Which ask'd three Grecians with united force<br/>To thrust it to its place, and three again<br/>To thrust it back, although Achilles oft<br/>Would heave it to the door himself alone;)<br/>Then Hermes, benefactor of mankind,<br/>That bar displacing for the King of Troy,<br/>Gave entrance to himself and to his gifts<br/>For Peleus' son design'd, and from the seat<br/>Alighting, thus his speech to Priam turn'd.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/>
