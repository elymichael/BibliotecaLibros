Wouldst thou that I wait<br/>Thy coming, there, or thy commands to both<br/>Given, that I incontinent return?<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>To whom the Sovereign of the host replied.<br/>There stay; lest striking into different paths<br/>(For many passes intersect the camp)<br/>We miss each other; summon them aloud<br/>Where thou shalt come; enjoin them to arise;<br/>Call each by his hereditary name,<br/>
