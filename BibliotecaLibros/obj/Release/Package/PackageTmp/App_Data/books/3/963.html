Alike and knowledge thine surpass so far,<br/>It suits not. Oh stupidity! how gross<br/>Art thou and senseless! Are no traces left<br/>In thy remembrance of our numerous wrongs<br/>Sustain'd at Ilium, when, of all the Gods<br/>Ourselves alone, by Jove's commandment, served<br/>For stipulated hire, a year complete,<br/>Our task-master the proud Laomedon?<br/>Myself a bulwark'd town, spacious, secure<br/>Against assault, and beautiful as strong<br/>Built for the Trojans, and thine office was<br/>To feed for King Laomedon his herds<br/>Among the groves of Ida many-valed.<br/>But when the gladsome hours the season brought<br/>Of payment, then the unjust King of Troy<br/>Dismiss'd us of our whole reward amerced<br/>By violence, and added threats beside.<br/>Thee into distant isles, bound hand and foot,<br/>To sell he threatened, and to amputate<br/>The ears of both; we, therefore, hasted thence<br/>Resenting deep our promised hire withheld.<br/>
