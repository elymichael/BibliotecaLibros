The phantom summoning, him thus addressed.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Haste, evil Dream! Fly to the Grecian fleet,<br/>And, entering royal Agamemnon's tent,<br/>His ear possess thou thus, omitting nought<br/>Of all that I enjoin thee. Bid him arm<br/>His universal host, for that the time<br/>When the Achaians shall at length possess<br/>Wide Ilium, hath arrived. The Gods above<br/>No longer dwell at variance. The request<br/>Of Juno hath prevail'd; now, wo to Troy!<br/>So charged, the Dream departed. At the ships<br/>Well-built arriving of Achaia's host,<br/>He Agamemnon, son of Atreus, sought.<br/>Him sleeping in his tent he found, immersed<br/>In soft repose ambrosial. At his head<br/>The shadow stood, similitude exact<br/>Of Nestor, son of Neleus; sage, with whom<br/>In Agamemnon's thought might none compare.<br/>
