Shalt also perish if thou dare abide<br/>My massy spear, which shall thy pamper'd flesh<br/>Disfigure, and amid the barks of Greece<br/>Falling, thou shalt the vultures with thy bulk<br/>Enormous satiate, and the dogs of Troy.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>He spake, and led his host; with clamor loud<br/>They follow'd him, and all the distant rear<br/>Came shouting on. On the other side the Greeks<br/>Re-echoed shout for shout, all undismay'd,<br/>And waiting firm the bravest of their foes.<br/>Upwent the double roar into the heights<br/>Ethereal, and among the beams of Jove.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
