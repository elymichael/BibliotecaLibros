The lofty towers of Scyros, the divine
Achilles took, and on his friend bestow'd.

But when those Chiefs at Agamemnon's tent
Arrived, the Greeks on every side arose
With golden cups welcoming their return.
All question'd them, but Agamemnon first.

&#160;

Oh worthy of Achaia's highest praise,
And her chief ornament, Ulysses, speak!
Will he defend the fleet? or his big heart
Indulging wrathful, doth he still refuse?

&#160;

To whom renown'd Ulysses thus replied.
Atrides, Agamemnon, King of men!
