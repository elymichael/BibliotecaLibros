Meriones; most willing Nestor's son;<br/>Willing the brother of the Chief of all,<br/>Nor willing less Ulysses to explore<br/>The host of Troy, for he possess'd a heart<br/>Delighted ever with some bold exploit.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Then Agamemnon, King of men, began.<br/>Now Diomede, in whom my soul delights!<br/>Choose whom thou wilt for thy companion; choose<br/>The fittest here; for numerous wish to go.<br/>Leave not through deference to another's rank,<br/>The more deserving, nor prefer a worse,<br/>Respecting either pedigree or power.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Such speech he interposed, fearing his choice<br/>Of Menelaus; then, renown'd in arms<br/>The son of Tydeus, rising, spake again.<br/>
