And calling golden Venus, her bespake.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>War and the tented field, my beauteous child,<br/>Are not for thee. Thou rather shouldst be found<br/>In scenes of matrimonial bliss. The toils<br/>Of war to Pallas and to Mars belong.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Thus they in heaven. But Diomede the while<br/>Sprang on Æneas, conscious of the God<br/>Whose hand o'ershadow'd him, yet even him<br/>Regarding lightly; for he burn'd to slay<br/>Æneas, and to seize his glorious arms.<br/>Thrice then he sprang impetuous to the deed,<br/>And thrice Apollo with his radiant shield<br/>Repulsed him. But when ardent as a God<br/>The fourth time he advanced, with thundering-voice<br/>Him thus the Archer of the skies rebuked.<br/>
