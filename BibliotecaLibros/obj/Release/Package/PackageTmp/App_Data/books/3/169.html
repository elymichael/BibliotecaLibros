<br/>&#160;<br/><br/>But him, the hero of the golden locks<br/>Thus cheer'd. My brother, fear not, nor infect<br/>With fear the Grecians; the sharp-pointed reed<br/>Hath touch'd no vital part. The broider'd zone,<br/>The hauberk, and the tough interior quilt,<br/>Work of the armorer, its force repress'd.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Him answer'd Agamemnon, King of men.<br/>So be it brother! but the hand of one<br/>Skilful to heal shall visit and shall dress<br/>The wound with drugs of pain-assuaging power.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>He ended, and his noble herald, next,<br/>Bespake, Talthybius. Haste, call hither quick<br/>
