For Oeneus, on a time, full twenty days<br/>Regaled Bellerophon, and pledges fair<br/>Of hospitality they interchanged.<br/>Oeneus a belt radiant with purple gave<br/>To brave Bellerophon, who in return<br/>Gave him a golden goblet. Coming forth<br/>I left the kind memorial safe at home.<br/>A child was I when Tydeus went to Thebes,<br/>Where the Achaians perish'd, and of him<br/>Hold no remembrance; but henceforth, my friend,<br/>Thine host am I in Argos, and thou mine<br/>In Lycia, should I chance to sojourn there.<br/>We will not clash. Trojans or aids of Troy<br/>No few the Gods shall furnish to my spear,<br/>Whom I may slaughter; and no want of Greeks<br/>On whom to prove thy prowess, thou shalt find.<br/>But it were well that an exchange ensued<br/>Between us; take mine armor, give me thine,<br/>That all who notice us may understand<br/>Our patrimonial&#160;amity and love.<br/><br/>
