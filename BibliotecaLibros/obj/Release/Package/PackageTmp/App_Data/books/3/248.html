Urges, and need appears that we ourselves<br/>Now call to mind the fury of our might.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>She spake; nor blue-eyed Pallas not complied.<br/>Then Juno, Goddess dread, from Saturn sprung,<br/>Her coursers gold-caparison'd prepared<br/>Impatient. Hebe to the chariot roll'd<br/>The brazen wheels,&#160;and joined them to the smooth<br/>Steel axle; twice four spokes divided each<br/>Shot from the centre to the verge. The verge<br/>Was gold by fellies of eternal brass<br/>Guarded, a dazzling show! The shining naves<br/>Were silver; silver cords and cords of gold<br/>The seat upbore; two crescents&#160;blazed in front.<br/>The pole was argent all, to which she bound<br/>The golden yoke, and in their place disposed<br/>The breast-bands incorruptible of gold;<br/>But Juno to the yoke, herself, the steeds<br/>Led forth, on fire to reach the dreadful field.<br/>
