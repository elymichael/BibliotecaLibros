How thenâ€”shall I withstand him here before<br/>The city? He hath also flesh to steel<br/>Pervious, within it but a single life,<br/>And men report him mortal, howsoe'er<br/>Saturnian Jove lift him to glory now.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>So saying, he turn'd and stood, his dauntless heart<br/>Beating for battle. As the pard springs forth<br/>To meet the hunter from her gloomy lair,<br/>Nor, hearing loud the hounds, fears or retires,<br/>But whether from afar or nigh at hand<br/>He pierce her first, although transfixt, the fight<br/>Still tries, and combats desperate till she fall,<br/>So, brave Antenor's son fled not, or shrank,<br/>Till he had proved Achilles, but his breast<br/>O'ershadowing with his buckler and his spear<br/>Aiming well-poised against him, loud exclaim'd.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/>
