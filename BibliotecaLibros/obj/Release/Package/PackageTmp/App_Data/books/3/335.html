From tent to tent slaughter'd the fatted ox<br/>And ate their evening cheer. Meantime arrived<br/>Large fleet with Lemnian wine; Euneus, son<br/>Of Jason and Hypsipile, that fleet<br/>From Lemnos freighted, and had stow'd on board<br/>A thousand measures from the rest apart<br/>For the Atridæ; but the host at large<br/>By traffic were supplied; some barter'd brass,<br/>Others bright steel; some purchased wine with hides,<br/>These with their cattle, with their captives those,<br/>And the whole host prepared a glad regale.<br/>All night the Grecians feasted, and the host<br/>Of Ilium, and all night deep-planning Jove<br/>Portended dire calamities to both,<br/>Thundering tremendous!—Pale was every cheek;<br/>Each pour'd his goblet on the ground, nor dared<br/>The hardiest drink, 'till he had first perform'd<br/>Libation meet to the Saturnian King<br/>Omnipotent; then, all retiring, sought<br/>Their couches, and partook the gift of sleep.<br/><br/>
