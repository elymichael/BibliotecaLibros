Thou come, behold! I fight not with the Gods.<br/>That war Lycurgus son of Dryas waged,<br/>And saw not many years. The nurses he<br/>Of brain-disturbing Bacchus down the steep<br/>Pursued of sacred Nyssa; they their wands<br/>Vine-wreathed cast all away, with an ox-goad<br/>Chastised by fell Lycurgus. Bacchus plunged<br/>Meantime dismay'd into the deep, where him<br/>Trembling, and at the Hero's haughty threats<br/>Confounded, Thetis in her bosom hid.<br/>Thus by Lycurgus were the blessed powers<br/>Of heaven offended, and Saturnian Jove<br/>Of sight bereaved him, who not long that loss<br/>Survived, for he was curst by all above.<br/>I, therefore, wage no contest with the Gods;<br/>But if thou be of men, and feed on bread<br/>Of earthly growth, draw nigh, that with a stroke<br/>Well-aim'd, I may at once cut short thy days.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>
