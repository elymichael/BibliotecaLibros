Calchas, an augur foremost in his art,<br/>Who all things, present, past, and future knew,<br/>And whom his skill in prophecy, a gift<br/>Conferred by Ph≈ìbus on him, had advanced<br/>To be conductor of the fleet to Troy;<br/>He, prudent, them admonishing, replied.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Jove-loved Achilles! Wouldst thou learn from me<br/>What cause hath moved Apollo to this wrath,<br/>The shaft-arm'd King? I shall divulge the cause.<br/>But thou, swear first and covenant on thy part<br/>That speaking, acting, thou wilt stand prepared<br/>To give me succor; for I judge amiss,<br/>Or he who rules the Argives, the supreme<br/>O'er all Achaia's host, will be incensed.<br/>Wo to the man who shall provoke the King<br/>For if, to-day, he smother close his wrath,<br/>He harbors still the vengeance, and in time<br/>Performs it. Answer, therefore, wilt thou save me?<br/>
