Might none discern. For as a winter-flood<br/>Impetuous, mounds and bridges sweeps away;<br/>The buttress'd bridge checks not its sudden force,<br/>The firm inclosure of vine-planted fields<br/>Luxuriant, falls before it; finish'd works<br/>Of youthful hinds, once pleasant to the eye,<br/>Now levell'd, after ceaseless rain from Jove;<br/>So drove Tydides into sudden flight<br/>The Trojans; phalanx after phalanx fled<br/>Before the terror of his single arm.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>When him Lycaon's son illustrious saw<br/>Scouring the field, and from before his face<br/>The ranks dispersing wide, at once he bent<br/>Against Tydides his elastic bow.<br/>The arrow met him in his swift career<br/>Sure-aim'd; it struck direct the hollow mail<br/>Of his right shoulder, with resistless force<br/>Transfix'd it, and his hauberk stain'd with blood.<br/>
