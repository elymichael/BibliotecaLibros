Not so inclined, that arduous task, to cope<br/>With the unmatch'd Achilles? I have proved<br/>His force already, when he chased me down<br/>From Ida with his spear, what time he made<br/>Seizure of all our cattle, and destroy'd<br/>Pedasus and Lyrnessus; but I 'scaped<br/>Unslain, by Jove himself empower'd to fly,<br/>Else had I fallen by Achilles' hand,<br/>And by the hand of Pallas, who his steps<br/>Conducted, and exhorted him to slay<br/>Us and the Leleges.&#160;Vain, therefore, proves<br/>All mortal force to Peleus' son opposed;<br/>For one, at least, of the Immortals stands<br/>Ever beside him, guardian of his life,<br/>And, of himself, he hath an arm that sends<br/>His rapid spear unerring to the mark.<br/>Yet, would the Gods more equal sway the scales<br/>Of battle, not with ease should he subdue<br/>Me, though he boast a panoply of brass.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/>
