ARGUMENT OF THE NINETEENTH BOOK.

Achilles is reconciled to Agamemnon, and clothed in new armor
forged by Vulcan, leads out the Myrmidons to battle.

&#160;


Now rose the morn in saffron vest attired
From ocean, with new day for Gods and men,
When Thetis at the fleet of Greece arrived,
Bearing that gift divine. She found her son
All tears, and close enfolding in his arms
Patroclus, while his Myrmidons around
Wept also;&#160;she amid them, graceful, stood,
