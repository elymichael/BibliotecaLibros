Him viewing, Argos' universal host<br/>Exulted, while a panic loosed the knees<br/>Of every Trojan; even Hector's heart<br/>Beat double, but escape for him remain'd<br/>None now, or to retreat into his ranks<br/>Again, from whom himself had challenged forth.<br/>Ajax advancing like a tower his shield<br/>Sevenfold, approach'd. It was the labor'd work<br/>Of Tychius, armorer of matchless skill,<br/>Who dwelt in Hyla; coated with the hides<br/>Of seven high-pamper'd bulls that shield he framed<br/>For Ajax, and the disk plated with brass.<br/>Advancing it before his breast, the son<br/>Of Telamon approach'd the Trojan Chief,<br/>And face to face, him threatening, thus began.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Now, Hector, prove, by me alone opposed,<br/>What Chiefs the Dana√Ø can furnish forth<br/>In absence of the lion-hearted prince<br/>
