&#160;<br/><br/>So Helenus; nor Hector not complied.<br/>Down from his chariot instant to the ground<br/>All arm'd he leap'd, and, shaking his sharp spears,<br/>Through every phalanx pass'd, rousing again<br/>Their courage, and rekindling horrid war.<br/>They, turning, faced the Greeks; the Greeks repulsed,<br/>Ceased from all carnage, nor supposed they less<br/>Than that some Deity, the starry skies<br/>Forsaken, help'd their foes, so firm they stood.<br/>But Hector to the Trojans call'd aloud.<br/>Ye dauntless Trojans and confederate powers<br/>Call'd from afar! now be ye men, my friends,<br/>Now summon all the fury of your might!<br/>I go to charge our senators and wives<br/>That they address the Gods with prayers and vows<br/>For our success, and hecatombs devote.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>
