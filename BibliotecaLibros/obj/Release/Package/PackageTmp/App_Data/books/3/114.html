<br/>But Hector! chiefly thee I shall exhort.<br/>In Priam's spacious city are allies<br/>Collected numerous, and of nations wide<br/>Disseminated various are the tongues.<br/>Let every Chief his proper troop command,<br/>And marshal his own citizens to war.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>She ceased; her Hector heard intelligent,<br/>And quick dissolved the council. All took arms.<br/>Wide flew the gates; forth rush'd the multitude,<br/>Horsemen and foot, and boisterous stir arose.<br/>In front of Ilium, distant on the plain,<br/>Clear all around from all obstruction, stands<br/>An eminence high-raised, by mortal men<br/>Call'd Bateia, but the Gods the tomb<br/>Have named it of Myrinna swift in fight.<br/>Troy and her aids there set the battle forth.<br/><br/>
