Well fitted to his gripe two sturdy spears.<br/>Of all Achilles' arms his spear alone<br/>He took not; that huge beam, of bulk and length<br/>Enormous, none, Æacides except,<br/>In all Achaia's host had power to wield.<br/>It was that Pelian ash which from the top<br/>Of Pelion hewn that it might prove the death<br/>Of heroes, Chiron had to Peleus given.<br/>He bade Automedon his coursers bind<br/>Speedily to the yoke, for him he loved<br/>Next to Achilles most, as worthiest found<br/>Of trust, what time the battle loudest roar'd.<br/>Then led Automedon the fiery steeds<br/>Swift as wing'd tempests to the chariot-yoke,<br/>Xanthus and Balius. Them the harpy bore<br/>Podarge, while in meadows green she fed<br/>On Ocean's side, to Zephyrus the wind.<br/>To these he added, at their side, a third,<br/>The noble Pedasus; him Peleus' son,<br/>Eëtion's city taken, thence had brought,<br/>Though mortal, yet a match for steeds divine.<br/>
