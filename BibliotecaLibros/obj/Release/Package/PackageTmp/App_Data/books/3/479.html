The dust, darts, deaths, and tumult of the field;<br/>And Agamemnon to the swift pursuit<br/>Call'd loud the Grecians. Through the middle plain<br/>Beside the sepulchre of Ilus, son<br/>Of Dardanus, and where the fig-tree stood,<br/>The Trojans flew, panting to gain the town,<br/>While Agamemnon pressing close the rear,<br/>Shout after shout terrific sent abroad,<br/>And his victorious hands reek'd, red with gore.<br/>But at the beech-tree and the Sc√¶an gate<br/>Arrived, the Trojans halted, waiting there<br/>The rearmost fugitives; they o'er the field<br/>Came like a herd, which in the dead of night<br/>A lion drives; all fly, but one is doom'd<br/>To death inevitable; her with jaws<br/>True to their hold he seizes, and her neck<br/>Breaking, embowels her, and laps the blood;<br/>So, Atreus' royal son, the hindmost still<br/>Slaying, and still pursuing, urged them on.<br/>Many supine, and many prone, the field<br/>Press'd, by the son of Atreus in their flight<br/>
