To whom the herald Mercury replied.<br/>Thy questions, venerable sire! proposed<br/>Concerning noble Hector, are design'd<br/>To prove me. Him, not seldom, with these eyes<br/>In man-ennobling fight I have beheld<br/>Most active; saw him when he thinn'd the Greeks<br/>With his sharp spear, and drove them to the ships.<br/>Amazed we stood to notice him; for us,<br/>Incensed against the ruler of our host,<br/>Achilles suffer'd not to share the fight.<br/>I serve Achilles; the same gallant bark<br/>Brought us, and of the Myrmidons am I,<br/>Son of Polyctor; wealthy is my sire,<br/>And such in years as thou; six sons he hath,<br/>Beside myself the seventh, and (the lots cast<br/>Among us all) mine sent me to the wars.<br/>That I have left the ships, seeking the plain,<br/>The cause is this; the Greeks, at break of day,<br/>Will compass, arm'd, the city, for they loathe<br/>To sit inactive, neither can the chiefs<br/>Restrain the hot impatience of the host.<br/>
