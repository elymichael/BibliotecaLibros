At the whole multitude his glittering spear.<br/>He smote Pyræchmes; he his horsemen band<br/>Pœonian led from Amydon, and from<br/>Broad-flowing Axius. In his shoulder stood<br/>The spear, and with loud groans supine he fell.<br/>At once fled all his followers, on all sides<br/>With consternation fill'd, seeing their Chief<br/>And their best warrior, by Patroclus slain.<br/>Forth from the fleet he drove them, quench'd the flames,<br/>And rescued half the ship. Then scatter'd fled<br/>With infinite uproar the host of Troy,<br/>While from between their ships the Danaï<br/>Pour'd after them, and hideous rout ensued.<br/>As when the king of lightnings, Jove, dispels<br/>From some huge eminence a gloomy cloud,<br/>The groves, the mountain-tops, the headland heights<br/>Shine all, illumined from the boundless heaven,<br/>So when the Danaï those hostile fires<br/>Had from their fleet expell'd, awhile they breathed,<br/>Yet found short respite, for the battle yet<br/>Ceased not, nor fled the Trojans in all parts<br/>
