Can I expect, thy day of life extinct,<br/>But thenceforth, sorrow. Father I have none;<br/>No mother. When Cilicia's city, Thebes<br/>The populous, was by Achilles sack'd.<br/>He slew my father; yet his gorgeous arms<br/>Stripp'd not through reverence of him, but consumed,<br/>Arm'd as it was, his body on the pile,<br/>And heap'd his tomb, which the Oreades,<br/>Jove's daughters, had with elms inclosed around.<br/>My seven brothers, glory of our house,<br/>All in one day descended to the shades;<br/>For brave Achilles,&#160;while they fed their herds<br/>And snowy flocks together, slew them all.<br/>My mother, Queen of the well-wooded realm<br/>Of Hypoplacian Thebes, her hither brought<br/>Among his other spoils, he loosed again<br/>At an inestimable ransom-price,<br/>But by Diana pierced, she died at home.<br/>Yet Hectorâ€”oh my husband! I in thee<br/>Find parents, brothers, all that I have lost.<br/>Come! have compassion on us. Go not hence,<br/>
