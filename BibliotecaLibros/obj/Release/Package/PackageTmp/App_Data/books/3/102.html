From forty ships, Thoas, Andræmon's son,<br/>Had landed his Ætolians; for extinct<br/>Was Meleager, and extinct the house<br/>Of Oeneus all, nor Oeneus self survived;<br/>To Thoas therefore had Ætolia fallen;<br/>Him Olenos, Pylene, Chalcis served,<br/>With Pleuro, and the rock-bound Calydon.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Idomeneus, spear-practised warrior, led<br/>The numerous Cretans. In twice forty ships<br/>He brought his powers to Troy. The warlike bands<br/>Of Cnossus, of Gortyna wall'd around,<br/>Of Lyctus, of Lycastus chalky-white,<br/>Of Phæstus, of Miletus, with the youth<br/>Of Rhytius him obey'd; nor these were all,<br/>But others from her hundred cities Crete<br/>Sent forth, all whom Idomeneus the brave<br/>Commanded, with Meriones in arms<br/>Dread as the God of battles blood-imbrued.<br/>
