Arriving, mingled with her kindred Gods.<br/>But though from violence, yet not from words<br/>Abstained Achilles, but with bitter taunt<br/>Opprobrious, his antagonist reproached.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Oh charged with wine, in steadfastness of face<br/>Dog unabashed, and yet at heart a deer!<br/>Thou never, when the troops have taken arms,<br/>Hast dared to take thine also; never thou<br/>Associate with Achaia's Chiefs, to form<br/>The secret ambush.&#160;No. The sound of war<br/>Is as the voice of destiny to thee.<br/>Doubtless the course is safer far, to range<br/>Our numerous host, and if a man have dared<br/>Dispute thy will, to rob him of his prize.<br/>King! over whom? Women and spiritlessâ€”<br/>Whom therefore thou devourest; else themselves<br/>Would stop that mouth that it should scoff no more.<br/>But hearken. I shall swear a solemn oath.<br/>
