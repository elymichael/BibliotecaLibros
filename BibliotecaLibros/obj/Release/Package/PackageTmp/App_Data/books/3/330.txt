Till at the last brave Diomede replied.

&#160;

No. We will none of Paris' treasures now,
Nor even Helen's self. A child may see
Destruction winging swift her course to Troy.

All praised the speech of warlike Diomede,
And answer thus the King of men return'd.

Id√¶us! thou hast witness'd the resolve
Of the Achaian Chiefs, whose choice is mine.
But for the slain, I shall not envy them
A funeral pile; the spirit fled, delay
Suits not. Last rites can not too soon be paid.
