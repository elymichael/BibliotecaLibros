With right-hand flight toward the ruddy East,<br/>Or leftward down into the shades of eve.<br/>Consider<br/>we<br/>the will of Jove alone,<br/>Sovereign of heaven and earth. Omens abound,<br/>But the best omen is our country's cause.<br/>Wherefore should fiery war<br/>thy<br/>soul alarm?<br/>For were we slaughter'd, one and all, around<br/>The fleet of Greece,<br/>thou<br/>need'st not fear to die,<br/>Whose courage never will thy flight retard.<br/>But if thou shrink thyself, or by smooth speech<br/>Seduce one other from a soldier's part,<br/>Pierced by this spear incontinent thou diest.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>
