All weeping, after whom Achilles went<br/>Fast-weeping also at the doleful sight<br/>Of his true friend on his funereal bed<br/>Extended, gash'd with many a mortal wound,<br/>Whom he had sent into the fight with steeds<br/>And chariot, but received him thence no more.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>And now majestic Juno sent the sun,<br/>Unwearied minister of light, although<br/>Reluctant, down into the Ocean stream.<br/>So the sun sank, and the Achaians ceased<br/>From the all-wasting labors of the war.<br/>On the other side, the Trojans, from the fight<br/>Retiring, loosed their steeds, but ere they took<br/>Thought of refreshment, in full council met.<br/>It was a council at which no man sat,<br/>Or dared; all stood; such terror had on all<br/>Fallen, for that Achilles had appear'd,<br/>After long pause from battle's arduous toil.<br/>
