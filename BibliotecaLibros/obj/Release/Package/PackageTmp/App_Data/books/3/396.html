Whom when thou conquer'dst Lesbos, he received<br/>His chosen portion, passing woman-kind<br/>In perfect loveliness of face and form.<br/>These will he give, and will with these resign<br/>Her whom he took, Brise√Øs, with an oath<br/>Most solemn, that unconscious as she was<br/>Of his embraces, such he yields her back.<br/>All these he gives thee now! and if at length<br/>The Gods vouchsafe to us to overturn<br/>Priam's great city, thou shalt heap thy ships<br/>With gold and brass, entering and choosing first,<br/>When we shall share the spoil; and shalt beside<br/>Choose twenty from among the maids of Troy,<br/>Helen except, loveliest of all their sex.<br/>And if once more the rich milk-flowing land<br/>We reach of Argos, thou shalt there become<br/>His son-in-law, and shalt enjoy like state<br/>With him, whom he in all abundance rears,<br/>His only son Orestes. In his house<br/>He hath three daughters; thou may'st home conduct<br/>To Phthia, her whom thou shalt most approve.<br/>
