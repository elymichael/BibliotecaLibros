Consider this, ye Gods! weigh the event.<br/>Shall we from death save Hector? or, at length,<br/>Leave him, although in battle high renown'd,<br/>To perish by the might of Peleus' son?<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Whom answer'd thus Pallas cerulean-eyed.<br/>Dread Sovereign of the storms! what hast thou said?<br/>Wouldst thou deliver from the stroke of fate<br/>A mortal man death-destined from of old?<br/>Do it; but small thy praise shall be in heaven.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Then answer thus, cloud-gatherer Jove return'd.<br/>Fear not, Tritonia, daughter dear! that word<br/>Spake not my purpose; me thou shalt perceive<br/>Always to thee indulgent. What thou wilt<br/>That execute, and use thou no delay.<br/><br/>
