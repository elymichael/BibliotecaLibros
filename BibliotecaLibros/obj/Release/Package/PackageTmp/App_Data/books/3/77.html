&#160;<br/><br/>Atrides! Monarch! The Achaians seek<br/>To make thee ignominious above all<br/>In sight of all mankind. None recollects<br/>His promise more in steed-famed Argos pledged,<br/>Here to abide till Ilium wall'd to heaven<br/>Should vanquish'd sink, and all her wealth be ours.<br/>Noâ€”now, like widow'd women, or weak boys,<br/>They whimper to each other, wishing home.<br/>And home, I grant, to the afflicted soul<br/>Seems pleasant.&#160;The poor seaman from his wife<br/>One month detain'd, cheerless his ship and sad<br/>Possesses, by the force of wintry blasts,<br/>And by the billows of the troubled deep<br/>Fast lock'd in port. But us the ninth long year<br/>Revolving, finds camp'd under Ilium still.<br/>I therefore blame not, if they mourn beside<br/>Their sable barks, the Grecians. Yet the shame<br/>That must attend us after absence long<br/>Returning unsuccessful, who can bear?<br/>
