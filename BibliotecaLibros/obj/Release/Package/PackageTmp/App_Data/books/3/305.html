I have heard the voice<br/>Of the Eternal Gods, and well-assured<br/>Foretell thee that thy death not now impends.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>He spake, whom Hector heard with joy elate.<br/>Before his van striding into the space<br/>Both hosts between, he with his spear transverse<br/>Press'd back the Trojans, and they sat. Down sat<br/>The well-greaved Grecians also at command<br/>Of Agamemnon; and in shape assumed<br/>Of vultures, Pallas and Apollo perch'd<br/>High on the lofty beech sacred to Jove<br/>
