By human hands to fall, and hands divine.

The interposing Furies at that word
Suppress'd his utterance,&#160;and indignant, thus,
Achilles, swiftest of the swift, replied.

&#160;

Why, Xanthus, propheciest thou my death?
It ill beseems thee. I already know
That from my parents far remote my doom
Appoints me here to die; yet not the more
Cease I from feats if arms, till Ilium's host
Shall have received, at length, their fill of war.

&#160;

He said, and with a shout drove forth to battle.
