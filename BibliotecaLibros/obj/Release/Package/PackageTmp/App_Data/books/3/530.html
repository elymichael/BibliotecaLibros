Rang, while the Grecians, by the scourge of Jove<br/>Subdued, stood close within their fleet immured,<br/>At Hector's phalanx-scattering force appall'd.<br/>He, as before, with whirlwind fury fought.<br/>As when the boar or lion fiery-eyed<br/>Turns short, the hunters and the hounds among,<br/>The close-embattled troop him firm oppose,<br/>And ply him fast with spears; he no dismay<br/>Conceives or terror in his noble heart,<br/>But by his courage falls; frequent he turns<br/>Attempting bold the ranks, and where he points<br/>Direct his onset, there the ranks retire;<br/>So, through the concourse on his rolling wheels<br/>Borne rapid, Hector animated loud<br/>His fellow-warriors to surpass the trench.<br/>But not his own swift-footed steeds would dare<br/>That hazard; standing on the dangerous brink<br/>They neigh'd aloud, for by its breadth the foss<br/>Deterr'd them; neither was the effort slight<br/>To leap that gulf, nor easy the attempt<br/>To pass it through; steep were the banks profound<br/>
