The force in fight of many a Trojan more.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>He said, and sprang to battle with loud voice,<br/>Calling the Grecians after him.â€”Ye sons<br/>Of the Achaians! stand not now aloof,<br/>My noble friends! but foot to foot let each<br/>Fall on courageous, and desire the fight.<br/>The task were difficult for me alone,<br/>Brave as I boast myself, to chase a foe<br/>So numerous, and to combat with them all.<br/>Not Mars himself, immortal though he be,<br/>Nor Pallas, could with all the ranks contend<br/>Of this vast multitude, and drive the whole.<br/>With hands, with feet, with spirit and with might,<br/>All that I can I will; right through I go,<br/>And not a Trojan who shall chance within<br/>Spear's reach of me, shall, as I judge, rejoice.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/>
