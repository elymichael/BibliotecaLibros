Now old himself, had on his son conferr'd<br/>But in those arms his son grew never old.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Him, therefore, soon as cloud-assembler Jove<br/>Saw glittering in divine Achilles' arms,<br/>Contemplative he shook his brows, and said,<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Ah hapless Chief! thy death, although at hand,<br/>Nought troubles thee. Thou wear'st his heavenly<br/>Who all excels, terror of Ilium's host.<br/>His friend, though bold yet gentle, thou hast slain<br/>And hast the brows and bosom of the dead<br/>Unseemly bared: yet, bright success awhile<br/>I give thee; so compensating thy lot,<br/>From whom Andromache shall ne'er receive<br/>Those glorious arms, for thou shalt ne'er return.<br/><br/>
