<p>
With ceaseless rage to ruin populous Troy?<br/>Go, make thine entrance at her lofty gates,<br/>Priam and all his house, and all his host<br/>Alive devour; then, haply, thou wilt rest;<br/>Do even as thou wilt, that this dispute<br/>Live not between us a consuming fire<br/>For ever. But attend; mark well the word.<br/>When I shall also doom in future time<br/>Some city to destruction, dear to thee,<br/>Oppose me not, but give my fury way<br/>As I give way to thine, not pleased myself,<br/>Yet not unsatisfied, so thou be pleased.<br/>For of all cities of the sons of men,<br/>And which the sun and stars from heaven behold,<br/>Me sacred Troy most pleases, Priam me<br/>Most, and the people of the warrior King.<br/>Nor without cause. They feed mine altar well;<br/>Libation there, and steam of savory scent<br/>Fail not, the tribute which by lot is ours.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/>
