And a brave man had stripp'd me of my arms.<br/>But fate now dooms me to a death abhorr'd<br/>Whelm'd in deep waters, like a swine-herd's boy<br/>Drown'd in wet weather while he fords a brook.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>So spake Achilles; then, in human form,<br/>Minerva stood and Neptune at his side;<br/>Each seized his hand confirming him, and thus<br/>The mighty Shaker of the shores began.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Achilles! moderate thy dismay, fear nought.<br/>In us behold, in Pallas and in me,<br/>Effectual aids, and with consent of Jove;<br/>For to be vanquish'd by a River's force<br/>Is not thy doom. This foe shall soon be quell'd;<br/>Thine eyes shall see it. Let our counsel rule<br/>Thy deed, and all is well. Cease not from war<br/>
