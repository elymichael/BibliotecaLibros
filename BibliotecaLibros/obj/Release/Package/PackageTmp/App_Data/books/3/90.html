Of Heroes, eminent above them all.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Tell me, (for ye are are heavenly, and beheld<br/>A scene, whereof the faint report alone<br/>Hath reached our ears, remote and ill-informed,)<br/>Tell me, ye Muses, under whom, beneath<br/>What Chiefs of royal or of humbler note<br/>Stood forth the embattled Greeks? The host at large;<br/><br/>They<br/>were a multitude in number more<br/>Than with ten tongues, and with ten mouths, each mouth<br/>Made vocal with a trumpet's throat of brass<br/>I might declare, unless the Olympian nine,<br/>Jove's daughters, would the chronicle themselves<br/>Indite, of all assembled, under Troy.<br/>I will rehearse the Captains and their fleets.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/>
