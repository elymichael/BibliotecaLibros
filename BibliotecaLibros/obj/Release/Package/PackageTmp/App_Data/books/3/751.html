His father's will, but, from the Id√¶an heights<br/>Descending swift into the dreadful field,<br/>Godlike Sarpedon's body from beneath<br/>The hill of weapons drew, which, borne remote,<br/>He laved in waters of the running stream,<br/>With oils ambrosial bathed, and clothed in robes<br/>Immortal. Then to Death and gentle Sleep,<br/>Swift-bearers both, twin-born, he gave the charge,<br/>Who placed it soon in Lycia's wealthy realm.<br/><br/>Meantime Patroclus, calling to his steeds,<br/>And to Automedon, the Trojans chased<br/>And Lycians, on his own destruction bent<br/>Infatuate; heedless of his charge received<br/>From Peleus' son, which, well perform'd, had saved<br/>The hero from his miserable doom.<br/>But Jove's high purpose evermore prevails<br/>Against the thoughts of man; he turns to flight<br/>The bravest, and the victory takes with ease<br/>E'en from the Chief whom he impels himself<br/>To battle, as he now this Chief impell'd.<br/>
