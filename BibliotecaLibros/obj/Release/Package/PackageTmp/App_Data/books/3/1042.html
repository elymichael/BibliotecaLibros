<br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Away—now stretch ye forward to the goal.<br/>I bid you not to an unequal strife<br/>With those of Diomede, for Pallas them<br/>Quickens that he may conquer, and the Chief<br/>So far advanced makes competition vain.<br/>But reach the son of Atreus, fly to reach<br/>His steeds, incontinent; ah, be not shamed<br/>For ever, foil'd by Æthe, by a mare!<br/>Why fall ye thus behind, my noblest steeds?<br/>I tell you both, and ye shall prove me true,<br/>No favor shall ye find at Nestor's hands,<br/>My valiant sire, but he will thrust his spear<br/>Right through you, should we lose, for sloth of yours,<br/>Or by your negligence, the nobler prize.<br/>Haste then—pursue him—reach the royal Chief—<br/>And how to pass him in yon narrow way<br/>Shall be my care, and not my care in vain.<br/><br/>
