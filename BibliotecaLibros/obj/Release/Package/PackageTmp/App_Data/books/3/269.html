With the assembled matrons, to the fane<br/>Of Pallas in the citadel of Troy.<br/>Opening her chambers' sacred doors, of all<br/>Her treasured mantles there, let her select<br/>The widest, most magnificently wrought,<br/>And which she values most;<br/>that<br/>let her spread<br/>On Athen√¶an Pallas' lap divine.<br/>Twelve heifers of the year yet never touch'd<br/>With puncture of the goad, let her alike<br/>Devote to her, if she will pity Troy,<br/>Our wives and little ones, and will avert<br/>The son of Tydeus from these sacred towers,<br/>That dreadful Chief, terror of all our host,<br/>Bravest, in my account, of all the Greeks.<br/>For never yet Achilles hath himself<br/>So taught our people fear, although esteemed<br/>Son of a Goddess. But this warrior's rage<br/>Is boundless, and his strength past all compare.<br/><br/>
