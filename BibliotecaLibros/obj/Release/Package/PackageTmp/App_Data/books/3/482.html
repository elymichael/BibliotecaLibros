Endue thee with such force, that thou shalt slay<br/>Till thou have reach'd the ships, and till, the sun<br/>Descending, sacred darkness cover all.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>So saying, swift-pinion'd Iris disappear'd.<br/>Then Hector from his chariot at a leap<br/>Came down all arm'd, and, shaking his bright spears,<br/>Ranged every quarter, animating loud<br/>The legions, and rekindling horrid war.<br/>Back roll'd the Trojan ranks, and faced the Greeks;<br/>The Greeks their host to closer phalanx drew;<br/>The battle was restored, van fronting van<br/>They stood, and Agamemnon into fight<br/>Sprang foremost, panting for superior fame.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Say now, ye Nine, who on Olympus dwell!<br/>What Trojan first, or what ally of Troy<br/>
