SECOND EDITION.

Soon after my publication of this work, I began to prepare it
for a second edition, by an accurate revisal of the first. It
seemed to me, that here and there, perhaps a slight alteration
might satisfy the demands of some, whom I was desirous to please;
and I comforted myself with the reflection, that if I still failed
to conciliate all, I should yet have no cause to account myself in
a singular degree unfortunate. To please an unqualified judge, an
author must sacrifice too much; and the attempt to please an
uncandid one were altogether hopeless. In one or other of these
classes may be ranged all such objectors, as would deprive blank
verse of one of its principal advantages, the variety of its
pauses; together with all such as deny the good effect, on the
whole, of a line, now and then, less harmonious than its
fellows.

With respect to the pauses, it has been affirmed with an
unaccountable rashness, that Homer himself has given me an example
of verse without them. Had this been true, it would by no means
have concluded against the use of them in an English version of
Homer; because, in one language, and in one species of metre, that
may be musical, which in another would be found disgusting. But the
assertion is totally unfounded. The pauses in Homer's verse are so
frequent and various, that to name another poet, if pauses are a
fault, more faulty than he, were, perhaps, impossible. It may even
be questioned, if a single passage of ten lines flowing with
uninterrupted smoothness could be singled out from all the
thousands that he has left us. He frequently pauses at the first
word of the line, when it consists of three or more syllables; not
seldom when of two; and sometimes even when of one only. In this
practice he was followed, as was observed in my Preface to the
first edition, by the Author of the Paradise Lost. An example
inimitable indeed, but which no writer of English heroic verse
without rhyme can neglect with impunity.

Similar to this is the objection which proscribes absolutely the
occasional use of a line irregularly constructed. When Horace
censured Lucilius for his lines
incomposite pede
currentes
, he did not mean to say, that he was xiv
chargeable with such in some instances, or even in
many, for then the censure would have been equally applicable to
himself; but he designed by that expression to characterize all his
writings. The censure therefore was just; Lucilius wrote at a time
when the Roman verse had not yet received its polish, and instead
of introducing artfully his rugged lines, and to serve a particular
purpose, had probably seldom, and never but by accident, composed a
smooth one. Such has been the versification of the earliest poets
in every country. Children lisp, at first, and stammer; but, in
time, their speech becomes fluent, and, if they are well taught,
harmonious.

Homer himself is not invariably regular in the construction of
his verse. Had he been so, Eustathius, an excellent critic and warm
admirer of Homer, had never affirmed, that some of his lines want a
head, some a tail, and others a middle. Some begin with a word that
is neither dactyl nor spondee, some conclude with a dactyl, and in
the intermediate part he sometimes deviates equally from the
established custom. I confess that instances of this sort are rare;
but they are surely, though few, sufficient to warrant a sparing
use of similar license in the present day.

Unwilling, however, to seem obstinate in both these particulars,
I conformed myself in some measure to these objections, though
unconvinced myself of their propriety. Several of the rudest and
most unshapely lines I composed anew; and several of the pauses
least in use I displaced for the sake of an easier enunciation.â€”And
this was the state of the work after the revisal given it about
seven years since.

Between that revisal and the present a considerable time
intervened, and the effect of long discontinuance was, that I
became more dissatisfied with it myself, than the most difficult to
be pleased of all my judges. Not for the sake of a few uneven lines
or unwonted pauses, but for reasons far more substantial. The
diction seemed to me in many passages either not sufficiently
elevated, or deficient in the grace of ease, and in others I found
the sense of the original either not adequately expressed or
misapprehended. Many elisions still remained unsoftened; the
compound epithets I found not always happily combined, and the same
sometimes too frequently repeated.

There is no end of passages in Homer, which must creep unless
they are lifted; yet in such, all embellishment is out of the
question. The hero puts on his clothes, or refreshes himself with
food and wine, or he yokes his steed, takes a journey, and in the
evening preparation is made for his repose. To give relief to
subjects prosaic as these without seeming unreasonably tumid is
extremely difficult. Mr. Pope much abridges some of them, and
others he omits; but neither of these liberties was compatible with
the nature of my undertaking. These, therefore, and many similar to
these, have been new-modeled; somewhat to their advantage I hope,
but not even now entirely to my satisfaction. The lines have a more
natural movement, the pauses are fewer and less stately, the
expression as easy as I could make it without meanness, and these
were all the improvements that I could give them.

The elisions, I believe, are all cured, with only one exception.
