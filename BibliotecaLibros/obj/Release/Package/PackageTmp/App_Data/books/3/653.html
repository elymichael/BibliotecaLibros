Fill'd his victorious hand with armor stript<br/>From slaughter'd Trojans, after Ocean's God<br/>Had, interposing, changed the battle's course?<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>First, Telamonian Ajax Hyrtius slew,<br/>Undaunted leader of the Mysian band.<br/>Phalces and Mermerus their arms resign'd<br/>To young Antilochus; Hyppotion fell<br/>And Morys by Meriones; the shafts<br/>Right-aim'd of Teucer to the shades dismiss'd<br/>Prothöus and Periphetes, and the prince<br/>Of Sparta, Menelaus, in his flank<br/>Pierced Hyperenor; on his entrails prey'd<br/>The hungry steel, and, through the gaping wound<br/>Expell'd, his spirit flew; night veil'd his eyes.<br/>But Ajax Oïliades the swift<br/>Slew most; him none could equal in pursuit<br/>Of tremblers scatter'd by the frown of Jove.<br/><br/>
