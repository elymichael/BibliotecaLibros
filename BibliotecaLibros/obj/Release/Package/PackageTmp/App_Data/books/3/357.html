Thus shoot, that light may visit once again<br/>The Dana√Ø, and Telamon rejoice!<br/>Thee Telamon within his own abode<br/>Rear'd although spurious; mount him, in return,<br/>Although remote, on glory's heights again.<br/>I tell thee, and the effect shall follow sure,<br/>Let but the Thunderer and Minerva grant<br/>The pillage of fair Ilium to the Greeks,<br/>And I will give to thy victorious hand,<br/>After my own, the noblest recompense,<br/>A tripod or a chariot with its steeds,<br/>Or some fair captive to partake thy bed.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>To whom the generous Teucer thus replied.<br/>Atrides! glorious monarch! wherefore me<br/>Exhortest thou to battle? who myself<br/>Glow with sufficient ardor, and such strength<br/>As heaven affords me spare not to employ.<br/>Since first we drove them back, with watchful eye<br/>
