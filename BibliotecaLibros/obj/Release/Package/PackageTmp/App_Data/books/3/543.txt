With right-hand flight toward the ruddy East,
Or leftward down into the shades of eve.
Consider
we
the will of Jove alone,
Sovereign of heaven and earth. Omens abound,
But the best omen is our country's cause.
Wherefore should fiery war
thy
soul alarm?
For were we slaughter'd, one and all, around
The fleet of Greece,
thou
need'st not fear to die,
Whose courage never will thy flight retard.
But if thou shrink thyself, or by smooth speech
Seduce one other from a soldier's part,
Pierced by this spear incontinent thou diest.
