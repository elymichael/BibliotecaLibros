&#160;<br/><br/>My noble friend, Thöotes! with all speed<br/>Call either Ajax; bid them hither both;<br/>Far better so; for havoc is at hand.<br/>The Lycian leaders, ever in assault<br/>Tempestuous, bend their force against this tower<br/>My station. But if also there they find<br/>Laborious conflict pressing them severe,<br/>At least let Telamonian Ajax come,<br/>And Teucer with his death-dispensing bow.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>He spake, nor was Thöotes slow to hear;<br/>Beside the rampart of the mail-clad Greeks<br/>Rapid he flew, and, at their side arrived,<br/>To either Ajax, eager, thus began.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>
