He ended, nor Patroclus disobey'd,
But leading beautiful BrisÃ«is forth
Into their guidance gave her; loth she went
From whom she loved, and looking oft behind.

With eyes directed to the gloomy Deep
And arms outstretch'd, his mother suppliant sought.

I am thy son, I might with cause expect
Some honor at the Thunderer's hands, but none
To me he shows, whom Agamemnon, Chief
Of the Achaians, hath himself disgraced,
