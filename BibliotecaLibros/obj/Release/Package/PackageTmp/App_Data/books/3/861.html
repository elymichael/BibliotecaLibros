A labyrinth for the dance, such as of old<br/>In Crete's broad island Dædalus composed<br/>For bright-hair'd Ariadne.&#160;There the youths<br/>And youth-alluring maidens, hand in hand,<br/>Danced jocund, every maiden neat-attired<br/>In finest linen, and the youths in vests<br/>Well-woven, glossy as the glaze of oil.<br/>These all wore garlands, and bright falchions, those,<br/>Of burnish'd gold in silver trappings hung:—<br/>They with well-tutor'd step, now nimbly ran<br/>The circle, swift, as when, before his wheel<br/>Seated, the potter twirls it with both hands<br/>For trial of its speed,&#160;now, crossing quick<br/>They pass'd at once into each other's place.<br/>On either side spectators numerous stood<br/>Delighted, and two tumblers roll'd themselves<br/>Between the dancers, singing as they roll'd.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Last, with the might of ocean's boundless flood<br/>
