<br/>&#160;<br/><br/>To whom the white-arm'd Goddess thus replied.<br/>Themis divine, ask not. Full well thou know'st<br/>How harshly temper'd is the mind of Jove,<br/>And how untractable. Resume thy seat;<br/>The banquet calls thee; at our board preside,<br/>Thou shalt be told, and all in heaven shall hear<br/>What ills he threatens; such as shall not leave<br/>All minds at ease, I judge, here or on earth,<br/>However tranquil some and joyous now.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>So spake the awful spouse of Jove, and sat.<br/>Then, all alike, the Gods displeasure felt<br/>Throughout the courts of Jove, but she, her lips<br/>Gracing with smiles from which her sable brows<br/>Dissented,&#160;thus indignant them address'd.<br/><br/>
