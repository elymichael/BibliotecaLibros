Responsive melody of vocal sweets.<br/>But when the sun's bright orb had now declined,<br/>Each to his mansion, wheresoever built<br/>By the lame matchless Architect, withdrew.<br/>Jove also, kindler of the fires of heaven,<br/>His couch ascending as at other times<br/>When gentle sleep approach'd him, slept serene,<br/>With golden-sceptred Juno at his side.<br/><br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
