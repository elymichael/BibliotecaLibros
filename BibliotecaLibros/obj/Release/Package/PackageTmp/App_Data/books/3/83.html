Himself afflicts, who in contentious broils<br/>Involves me, and in altercation vain.<br/>Thence all that wordy tempest for a girl<br/>Achilles and myself between, and I<br/>The fierce aggressor. Be that breach but heal'd!<br/>And Troy's reprieve thenceforth is at an end.<br/>Goâ€”take refreshment now that we may march<br/>Forth to our enemies. Let each whet well<br/>His spear, brace well his shield, well feed his brisk<br/>High-mettled horses, well survey and search<br/>His chariot on all sides, that no defect<br/>Disgrace his bright habiliments of war.<br/>So will we give the day from morn to eve<br/>To dreadful battle. Pause there shall be none<br/>Till night divide us. Every buckler's thong<br/>Shall sweat on the toil'd bosom, every hand<br/>That shakes the spear shall ache, and every steed<br/>Shall smoke that whirls the chariot o'er the plain.<br/>Wo then to whom I shall discover here<br/>Loitering among the tents; let him escape<br/>My vengeance if he can. The vulture's maw<br/>
