Who guard our cities; I may choose of them,<br/>And make the loveliest of them all my own.<br/>There, in my country, it hath ever been<br/>My dearest purpose, wedded to a wife<br/>Of rank convenient, to enjoy in peace<br/>Such wealth as ancient Peleus hath acquired.<br/>For life, in my account, surpasses far<br/>In value all the treasures which report<br/>Ascribed to populous Ilium, ere the Greeks<br/>Arrived, and while the city yet had peace;<br/>Those also which Apollo's marble shrine<br/>In rocky Pytho boasts. Fat flocks and beeves<br/>May be by force obtain'd, tripods and steeds<br/>Are bought or won, but if the breath of man<br/>Once overpass its bounds, no force arrests<br/>Or may constrain the unbodied spirit back.<br/>Me, as my silver-footed mother speaks<br/>Thetis, a twofold consummation waits.<br/>If still with battle I encompass Troy,<br/>I win immortal glory, but all hope<br/>Renounce of my return. If I return<br/>
