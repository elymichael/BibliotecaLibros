Achilles! bid thy mighty spirit down.<br/>Thou shouldst not be thus merciless; the Gods,<br/>Although more honorable, and in power<br/>And virtue thy superiors, are themselves<br/>Yet placable; and if a mortal man<br/>Offend them by transgression of their laws,<br/>Libation, incense, sacrifice, and prayer,<br/>In meekness offer'd turn their wrath away.<br/>Prayers are Jove's daughters,&#160;wrinkled,&#160;lame,<br/>slant-eyed,<br/>Which though far distant, yet with constant pace<br/>Follow Offence. Offence, robust of limb,<br/>And treading firm the ground, outstrips them all,<br/>And over all the earth before them runs<br/>Hurtful to man. They, following, heal the hurt.<br/>Received respectfully when they approach,<br/>They help us, and our prayers hear in return.<br/>But if we slight, and with obdurate heart<br/>Resist them, to Saturnian Jove they cry<br/>Against us, supplicating that Offence<br/>May cleave to us for vengeance of the wrong.<br/>Thou, therefore, O Achilles! honor yield<br/>
