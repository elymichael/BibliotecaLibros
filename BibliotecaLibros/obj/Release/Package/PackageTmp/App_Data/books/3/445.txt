He on Amphidamas the prize bestow'd
In Scandia;&#160;from Amphidamas it pass'd
To Molus as a hospitable pledge;
He gave it to Meriones his son,
And now it guarded shrewd Ulysses' brows.
Both clad in arms terrific, forth they sped,
Leaving their fellow Chiefs, and as they went
A heron, by command of Pallas, flew
Close on the right beside them; darkling they
Discern'd him not, but heard his clanging plumes.
Ulysses in the favorable sign
Exulted, and Minerva thus invoked.

&#160;

Oh hear me, daughter of Jove Ã†gis-arm'd!
My present helper in all straits, whose eye
Marks all my ways, oh with peculiar care
Now guard me, Pallas! grant that after toil
Successful, glorious, such as long shall fill
With grief the Trojans, we may safe return
