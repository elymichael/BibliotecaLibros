SECOND EDITION.<br/><br/>Soon after my publication of this work, I began to prepare it<br/>for a second edition, by an accurate revisal of the first. It<br/>seemed to me, that here and there, perhaps a slight alteration<br/>might satisfy the demands of some, whom I was desirous to please;<br/>and I comforted myself with the reflection, that if I still failed<br/>to conciliate all, I should yet have no cause to account myself in<br/>a singular degree unfortunate. To please an unqualified judge, an<br/>author must sacrifice too much; and the attempt to please an<br/>uncandid one were altogether hopeless. In one or other of these<br/>classes may be ranged all such objectors, as would deprive blank<br/>verse of one of its principal advantages, the variety of its<br/>pauses; together with all such as deny the good effect, on the<br/>whole, of a line, now and then, less harmonious than its<br/>fellows.<br/><br/>With respect to the pauses, it has been affirmed with an<br/>unaccountable rashness, that Homer himself has given me an example<br/>of verse without them. Had this been true, it would by no means<br/>have concluded against the use of them in an English version of<br/>Homer; because, in one language, and in one species of metre, that<br/>may be musical, which in another would be found disgusting. But the<br/>assertion is totally unfounded. The pauses in Homer's verse are so<br/>frequent and various, that to name another poet, if pauses are a<br/>fault, more faulty than he, were, perhaps, impossible. It may even<br/>be questioned, if a single passage of ten lines flowing with<br/>uninterrupted smoothness could be singled out from all the<br/>thousands that he has left us. He frequently pauses at the first<br/>word of the line, when it consists of three or more syllables; not<br/>seldom when of two; and sometimes even when of one only. In this<br/>practice he was followed, as was observed in my Preface to the<br/>first edition, by the Author of the Paradise Lost. An example<br/>inimitable indeed, but which no writer of English heroic verse<br/>without rhyme can neglect with impunity.<br/><br/>Similar to this is the objection which proscribes absolutely the<br/>occasional use of a line irregularly constructed. When Horace<br/>censured Lucilius for his lines<br/>incomposite pede<br/>currentes<br/>, he did not mean to say, that he was xiv<br/>chargeable with such in some instances, or even in<br/>many, for then the censure would have been equally applicable to<br/>himself; but he designed by that expression to characterize all his<br/>writings. The censure therefore was just; Lucilius wrote at a time<br/>when the Roman verse had not yet received its polish, and instead<br/>of introducing artfully his rugged lines, and to serve a particular<br/>purpose, had probably seldom, and never but by accident, composed a<br/>smooth one. Such has been the versification of the earliest poets<br/>in every country. Children lisp, at first, and stammer; but, in<br/>time, their speech becomes fluent, and, if they are well taught,<br/>harmonious.<br/><br/>Homer himself is not invariably regular in the construction of<br/>his verse. Had he been so, Eustathius, an excellent critic and warm<br/>admirer of Homer, had never affirmed, that some of his lines want a<br/>head, some a tail, and others a middle. Some begin with a word that<br/>is neither dactyl nor spondee, some conclude with a dactyl, and in<br/>the intermediate part he sometimes deviates equally from the<br/>established custom. I confess that instances of this sort are rare;<br/>but they are surely, though few, sufficient to warrant a sparing<br/>use of similar license in the present day.<br/><br/>Unwilling, however, to seem obstinate in both these particulars,<br/>I conformed myself in some measure to these objections, though<br/>unconvinced myself of their propriety. Several of the rudest and<br/>most unshapely lines I composed anew; and several of the pauses<br/>least in use I displaced for the sake of an easier enunciation.â€”And<br/>this was the state of the work after the revisal given it about<br/>seven years since.<br/><br/>Between that revisal and the present a considerable time<br/>intervened, and the effect of long discontinuance was, that I<br/>became more dissatisfied with it myself, than the most difficult to<br/>be pleased of all my judges. Not for the sake of a few uneven lines<br/>or unwonted pauses, but for reasons far more substantial. The<br/>diction seemed to me in many passages either not sufficiently<br/>elevated, or deficient in the grace of ease, and in others I found<br/>the sense of the original either not adequately expressed or<br/>misapprehended. Many elisions still remained unsoftened; the<br/>compound epithets I found not always happily combined, and the same<br/>sometimes too frequently repeated.<br/><br/>There is no end of passages in Homer, which must creep unless<br/>they are lifted; yet in such, all embellishment is out of the<br/>question. The hero puts on his clothes, or refreshes himself with<br/>food and wine, or he yokes his steed, takes a journey, and in the<br/>evening preparation is made for his repose. To give relief to<br/>subjects prosaic as these without seeming unreasonably tumid is<br/>extremely difficult. Mr. Pope much abridges some of them, and<br/>others he omits; but neither of these liberties was compatible with<br/>the nature of my undertaking. These, therefore, and many similar to<br/>these, have been new-modeled; somewhat to their advantage I hope,<br/>but not even now entirely to my satisfaction. The lines have a more<br/>natural movement, the pauses are fewer and less stately, the<br/>expression as easy as I could make it without meanness, and these<br/>were all the improvements that I could give them.<br/><br/>The elisions, I believe, are all cured, with only one exception.<br/>An alternative proposes itself to a modern versifier, from which<br/>there is no escape, xv<br/>which occurs<br/>perpetually, and which, choose as he may, presents him always with<br/>an evil. I mean in the instance of the particle (<br/>
