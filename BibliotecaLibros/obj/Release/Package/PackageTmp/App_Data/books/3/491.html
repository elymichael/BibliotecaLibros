Died and Hypeirochus. And now the son<br/>Of Saturn, looking down from Ida, poised<br/>The doubtful war, and mutual deaths they dealt.<br/>Tydides plunged his spear into the groin<br/>Of the illustrious son of PÃ¦on, bold<br/>Agastrophus. No steeds at his command<br/>Had he, infatuate! but his charioteer<br/>His steeds detain'd remote, while through the van<br/>Himself on foot rush'd madly till he fell.<br/>But Hector through the ranks darting his eye<br/>Perceived, and with ear-piercing cries advanced<br/>Against them, follow'd by the host of Troy.<br/>The son of Tydeus, shuddering, his approach<br/>Discern'd, and instant to Ulysses spake.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Now comes the storm! This way the mischief rolls!<br/>Stand and repulse the Trojan. Now be firm.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/>
