Then Menelaus fear'd,<br/>And with loud voice the son of Nestor hail'd.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Antilochus, at what a madman's rate<br/>Drivest thou! stop—check thy steeds—the way is here<br/>Too strait, but widening soon, will give thee scope<br/>To pass me by; beware, lest chariot close<br/>To chariot driven, thou maim thyself and me.<br/><br/>
