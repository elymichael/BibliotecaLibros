Matrons with all their children dragg'd away.<br/>That dread recital roused him, and at length<br/>Issuing, he put his radiant armor on.<br/>Thus Meleager, gratifying first<br/>His own resentment from a fatal day<br/>Saved the Ætolians, who the promised gift<br/>Refused him, and his toils found no reward.<br/>But thou, my son, be wiser; follow thou<br/>No demon who would tempt thee to a course<br/>Like his; occasion more propitious far<br/>Smiles on thee now, than if the fleet were fired.<br/>Come, while by gifts invited, and receive<br/>From all the host, the honors of a God;<br/>For shouldst thou, by no gifts induced, at last<br/>Enter the bloody field, although thou chase<br/>The Trojans hence, yet less shall be thy praise.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Then thus Achilles, matchless in the race.<br/>Phœnix, my guide, wise, noble and revered!<br/>
