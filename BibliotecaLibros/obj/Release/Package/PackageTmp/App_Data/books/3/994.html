I will not with dishonor foul insult<br/>Thy body, but, thine armor stripp'd, will give<br/>Thee to thy friends, as thou shalt me to mine.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>To whom Achilles, lowering dark, replied.<br/>Hector! my bitterest foe! speak not to me<br/>Of covenants! as concord can be none<br/>Lions and men between, nor wolves and lambs<br/>Can be unanimous, but hate perforce<br/>Each other by a law not to be changed,<br/>So cannot amity subsist between<br/>Thee and myself; nor league make I with thee<br/>Or compact, till thy blood in battle shed<br/>Or mine, shall gratify the fiery Mars.<br/>Rouse all thy virtue; thou hast utmost need<br/>Of valor now, and of address in arms.<br/>Escape me more thou canst not; Pallas' hand<br/>By mine subdues thee; now will I avenge<br/>At once the agonies of every Greek<br/>
