Of Solym√¶; and in her wrath divine<br/>Diana from her chariot golden-rein'd<br/>Laodamia slew. Myself I boast<br/>Sprung from Hippolochus; he sent me forth<br/>To fight for Troy, charging me much and oft<br/>That I should outstrip always all mankind<br/>In worth and valor, nor the house disgrace<br/>Of my forefathers, heroes without peer<br/>In Ephyra, and in Lycia's wide domain.<br/>Such is my lineage; such the blood I boast.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>He ceased. Then valiant Diomede rejoiced.<br/>He pitch'd his spear, and to the Lycian Prince<br/>In terms of peace and amity replied.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Thou art my own hereditary friend,<br/>Whose noble grandsire was the guest of mine.<br/>
