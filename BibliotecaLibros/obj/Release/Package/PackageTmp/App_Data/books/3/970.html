Now, wo to Troy!<br/>But soon as safe within the walls received<br/>They breathe again, shut fast the ponderous gates<br/>At once, lest that destroyer also pass.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>He said; they, shooting back the bars, threw wide<br/>The gates and saved the people, whom to aid<br/>Apollo also sprang into the field,<br/>They, parch'd with drought and whiten'd all with dust,<br/>Flew right toward the town, while, spear in hand,<br/>Achilles press'd them, vengeance in his heart<br/>And all on fire for glory. Then, full sure,<br/>Ilium, the city of lofty gates, had fallen<br/>Won by the Grecians, had not Ph≈ìbus roused<br/>Antenor's valiant son, the noble Chief<br/>Agenor; him with dauntless might he fill'd,<br/>And shielding him against the stroke of fate<br/>
