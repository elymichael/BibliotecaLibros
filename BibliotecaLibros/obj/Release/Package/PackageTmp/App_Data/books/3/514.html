By spear or arrow wounded in the fleet.<br/>Diomede, warlike son of Tydeus, bleeds,<br/>Gall'd by a shaft; Ulysses, glorious Chief,<br/>And Agamemnon&#160;suffer by the spear;<br/>Eurypylus is shot into the thigh,<br/>And here lies still another newly brought<br/>By me from fight, pierced also by a shaft.<br/>What then? How strong soe'er to give them aid,<br/>Achilles feels no pity of the Greeks.<br/>Waits he till every vessel on the shore<br/>Fired, in despite of the whole Argive host,<br/>Be sunk in its own ashes, and ourselves<br/>All perish, heaps on heaps? For in my limbs<br/>No longer lives the agility of my youth.<br/>Oh, for the vigor of those days again,<br/>When Elis, for her cattle which we took,<br/>Strove with us and Itymoneus I slew,<br/>Brave offspring of Hypirochus; he dwelt<br/>In Elis, and while I the pledges drove,<br/>Stood for his herd, but fell among the first<br/>By a spear hurl'd from my victorious arm.<br/>
