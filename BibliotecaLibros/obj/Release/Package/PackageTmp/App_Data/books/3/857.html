Seized newly wounded, and now captive held<br/>Another yet unhurt, and now a third<br/>Dragg'd breathless through the battle by his feet<br/>And all her garb was dappled thick with blood<br/>Like living men they traversed and they strove,<br/>And dragg'd by turns the bodies of the slain.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>He also graved on it a fallow field<br/>Rich, spacious, and well-till'd. Plowers not few,<br/>There driving to and fro their sturdy teams,<br/>Labor'd the land; and oft as in their course<br/>They came to the field's bourn, so oft a man<br/>Met them, who in their hands a goblet placed<br/>Charged with delicious wine. They, turning, wrought<br/>Each his own furrow, and impatient seem'd<br/>To reach the border of the tilth, which black<br/>Appear'd behind them as a glebe new-turn'd,<br/>Though golden. Sight to be admired by all!<br/><br/>
