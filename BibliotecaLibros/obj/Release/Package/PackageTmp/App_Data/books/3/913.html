Increases or reduces it in man,<br/>For he is lord of all. Therefore enough—<br/>Too long like children we have stood, the time<br/>Consuming here, while battle roars around.<br/>Reproach is cheap. Easily might we cast<br/>Gibes at each other, till a ship that asks<br/>A hundred oars should sink beneath the load.<br/>The tongue of man is voluble, hath words<br/>For every theme, nor wants wide field and long,<br/>And as he speaks so shall he hear again.<br/>But we—why should we wrangle, and with taunts<br/>Assail each other, as the practice is<br/>Of women, who with heart-devouring strife<br/>On fire, start forth into the public way<br/>To mock each other, uttering, as may chance,<br/>Much truth, much falsehood, as their anger bids?<br/>The ardor of my courage will not slack<br/>For all thy speeches; we must combat first;<br/>Now, therefore, without more delay, begin,<br/>That we may taste each other's force in arms.<br/><br/>
