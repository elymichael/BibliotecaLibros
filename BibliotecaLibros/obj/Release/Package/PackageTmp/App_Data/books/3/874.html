Laborious tasks servile, and of his birth<br/>Unworthy, at Eurystheus' will enjoin'd.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>So when the hero Hector at our ships<br/>Slew us, I then regretted my offence<br/>Which Ate first impell'd me to commit.<br/>But since, infatuated by the Gods<br/>I err'd, behold me ready to appease<br/>With gifts of price immense whom I have wrong'd.<br/>Thou, then, arise to battle, and the host<br/>Rouse also. Not a promise yesternight<br/>Was made thee by Ulysses in thy tent<br/>On my behalf, but shall be well perform'd.<br/>Or if it please thee, though impatient, wait<br/>Short season, and my train shall bring the gifts<br/>Even now; that thou may'st understand and know<br/>That my peace-offerings are indeed sincere.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/>
