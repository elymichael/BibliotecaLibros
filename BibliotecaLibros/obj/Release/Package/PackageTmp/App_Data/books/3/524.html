Left ye your native country that the dogs<br/>Might fatten on your flesh at distant Troy?<br/>But tell me, Hero! say, Eurypylus!<br/>Have the Achaians power still to withstand<br/>The enormous force of Hector, or is this<br/>The moment when his spear must pierce us all?<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>To whom Eurypylus, discreet, replied.<br/>Patroclus, dear to Jove! there is no help,<br/>No remedy. We perish at our ships.<br/>The warriors, once most strenuous of the Greeks,<br/>Lie wounded in the fleet by foes whose might<br/>Increases ever. But thyself afford<br/>To me some succor; lead me to my ship;<br/>Cut forth the arrow from my thigh; the gore<br/>With warm ablution cleanse, and on the wound<br/>Smooth unguents spread, the same as by report<br/>Achilles taught thee; taught, himself, their use<br/>By Chiron, Centaur, justest of his kind<br/>
