Since, by the will of heaven, this man is slain
Who harm'd us more than all our foes beside,
Essay we next the city, so to learn
The Trojan purpose, whether (Hector slain)
They will forsake the citadel, or still
Defend it, even though of him deprived.
But wherefore speak I thus? still undeplored,
Unburied in my fleet Patroclus lies;
Him never, while alive myself, I mix
With living men and move, will I forget.
In Ades, haply, they forget the dead,
Yet will not I Patroclus, even there.
Now chanting p√¶ans, ye Achaian youths!
Return we to the fleet with this our prize;
We have achieved great glory,&#160;we have slain
Illustrious Hector, him whom Ilium praised
In all her gates, and as a God revered.

&#160;

He said; then purposing dishonor foul
