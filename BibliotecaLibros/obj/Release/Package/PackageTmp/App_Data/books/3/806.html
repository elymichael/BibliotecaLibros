All clad in dazzling brass. Then, lifting high<br/>His tassel'd Ægis radiant, Jove with storms<br/>Enveloped Ida; flash'd his lightnings, roar'd<br/>His thunders, and the mountain shook throughout.<br/>Troy's host he prosper'd, and the Greeks dispersed.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>First fled Peneleus, the Bœotian Chief,<br/>Whom facing firm the foe Polydamas<br/>Struck on his shoulder's summit with a lance<br/>Hurl'd nigh at hand, which slight inscribed the bone.<br/>Leïtus also, son of the renown'd<br/>Alectryon, pierced by Hector in the wrist,<br/>Disabled left the fight; trembling he fled<br/>And peering narrowly around, nor hoped<br/>To lift a spear against the Trojans more.<br/>Hector, pursuing Leïtus, the point<br/>Encounter'd of the brave Idomeneus<br/>Full on his chest; but in his mail the lance<br/>Snapp'd, and the Trojans shouted to the skies.<br/>
