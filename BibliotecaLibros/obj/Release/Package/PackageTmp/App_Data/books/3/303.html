Marking from Pergamus, Apollo flew<br/>To meet her, ardent on the part of Troy.<br/>Beneath the beech they join'd, when first the King,<br/>The son of Jove, Apollo thus began.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Daughter of Jove supreme! why hast thou left<br/>Olympus, and with such impetuous speed?<br/>Comest thou to give the Danaï success<br/>Decisive? For I know that pity none<br/>Thou feel'st for Trojans, perish as they may<br/>But if advice of mine can influence thee<br/>To that which shall be best, let us compose<br/>This day the furious fight which shall again<br/>Hereafter rage, till Ilium be destroy'd.<br/>Since such is Juno's pleasure and thy own.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Him answer'd then Pallas cærulean-eyed.<br/>
