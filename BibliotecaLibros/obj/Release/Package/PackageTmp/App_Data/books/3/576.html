Emboldens even the weakest, and our might<br/>Hath oft been proved on warriors of renown.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>So Neptune spake, and, turning, sought again<br/>The toilsome field. Ere long, Idomeneus<br/>Arriving in his spacious tent, put on<br/>His radiant armor, and, two spears in hand,<br/>Set forth like lightning which Saturnian Jove<br/>From bright Olympus shakes into the air,<br/>A sign to mortal men, dazzling all eyes;<br/>So beam'd the Hero's armor as he ran.<br/>But him not yet far distant from his tent<br/>Meriones, his fellow-warrior met,<br/>For he had left the fight, seeking a spear,<br/>When thus the brave Idomeneus began.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Swift son of Molus! chosen companion dear!<br/>
