Loud shouted then Lycaon's son renown'd.

&#160;

Rush on, ye Trojans, spur your coursers hard.
Our fiercest foe is wounded, and I deem
His death not distant far, if me the King
Jove's son, indeed, from Lycia sent to Troy.

&#160;

So boasted Pandarus. Yet him the dart
Quell'd not. Retreating, at his coursers' heads
He stood, and to the son of Capaneus
His charioteer and faithful friend he said.

&#160;

Arise, sweet son of Capaneus, dismount,
And from my shoulder draw this bitter shaft.
