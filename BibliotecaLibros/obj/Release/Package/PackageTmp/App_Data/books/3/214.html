&#160;<br/><br/>Tydides, Diomede, my heart's delight!<br/>Two warriors of immeasurable force<br/>In battle, ardent to contend with thee,<br/>Come rattling on. Lycaon's offspring one,<br/>Bow-practised Pandarus; with whom appears<br/>Æneas; he who calls the mighty Chief<br/>Anchises father, and whom Venus bore.<br/>Mount—drive we swift away—lest borne so far<br/>Beyond the foremost battle, thou be slain.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>To whom, dark-frowning, Diomede replied<br/>Speak not of flight to me, who am disposed<br/>To no such course. I am ashamed to fly<br/>Or tremble, and my strength is still entire;<br/>I cannot mount. No. Rather thus, on foot,<br/>I will advance against them. Fear and dread<br/>Are not for me; Pallas forbids the thought.<br/>
