From side to side<br/>He slew; dread groans arose of dying men<br/>Hewn with the sword, and the earth swam with blood.<br/>As if he find a flock unguarded, sheep<br/>Or goats, the lion rushes on his prey,<br/>With such unsparing force Tydides smote<br/>The men of Thrace, till he had slaughter'd twelve;<br/>And whom Tydides with his falchion struck<br/>Laertes' son dragg'd by his feet abroad,<br/>Forecasting that the steeds might pass with ease,<br/>Nor start, as yet uncustom'd to the dead.<br/>But when the son of Tydeus found the King,<br/>Him also panting forth his last, last, breath,<br/>He added to the twelve; for at his head<br/>An evil dream that night had stood, the form<br/>Of Diomede, by Pallas' art devised.<br/>Meantime, the bold Ulysses loosed the steeds,<br/>Which, to each other rein'd, he drove abroad,<br/>Smiting them with his bow (for of the scourge<br/>He thought not in the chariot-seat secured)<br/>
