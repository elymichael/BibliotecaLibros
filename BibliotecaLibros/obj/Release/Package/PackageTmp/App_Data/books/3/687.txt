He pierced above his ear; down from the stern
Supine he fell, and in the dust expired.
Then, shuddering, Ajax to his brother spake.

&#160;

Alas, my Teucer! we have lost our friend;
Mastorides is slain, whom we received
An inmate from Cytheræ, and with love
And reverence even filia,, entertain'd;
Hector pierced, he dies. Where are thy shafts
Death-wing'd, and bow, by gift from Phœbus thine?

&#160;

He said, whom Teucer hearing, instant ran
With bow and well-stored quiver to his side,
Whence soon his arrows sought the Trojan host.
He struck Pisenor's son Clytus, the friend
And charioteer of brave Polydamas,
Offspring of Panthus, toiling with both hands
