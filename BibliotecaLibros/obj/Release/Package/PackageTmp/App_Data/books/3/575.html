Thoas! no Grecian is this day in fault!<br/>For we are all intelligent in arms,<br/>None yields by fear oppress'd, none lull'd by sloth<br/>From battle shrinks; but such the pleasure seems<br/>Of Jove himself, that we should perish here<br/>Inglorious, from our country far remote<br/>But, Thoas! (for thine heart was ever firm<br/>In battle, and thyself art wont to rouse<br/>Whom thou observ'st remiss) now also fight<br/>As erst, and urge each leader of the host.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Him answered, then, the Sovereign of the Deep.<br/>Return that Grecian never from the shores<br/>Of Troy, Idomeneus! but may the dogs<br/>Feast on him, who shall this day intermit<br/>Through wilful negligence his force in fight!<br/>But haste, take arms and come; we must exert<br/>All diligence, that, being only two,<br/>We yet may yield some service. Union much<br/>
