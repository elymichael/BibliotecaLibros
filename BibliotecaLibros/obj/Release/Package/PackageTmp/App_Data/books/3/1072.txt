Helmet and shield, which in the midst he placed.

I call for two brave warriors arm'd to prove
Each other's skill with weapons keen, this prize
Disputing, next, in presence of us all.
Who first shall through his armor reach the skin
Of his antagonist, and shall draw his blood,
To him this silver-studded falchion bright
I give; the blade is Thracian, and of late
Asterop√¶us wore it, whom I slew.
These other arms shall be their common meed,
And I will banquet both within my tent.

Arose, and opposite the son arose
Of warlike Tydeus, Diomede the brave.
