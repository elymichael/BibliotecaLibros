Although high-favored of Saturnian Jove,<br/>From death escape, but Fate and the revenge<br/>Restless of Juno vanquish'd even Him.<br/>I also, if a destiny like his<br/>Await me, shall, like him, find rest in death;<br/>But glory calls me now; now will I make<br/>Some Trojan wife or Dardan with both hands<br/>Wipe her soft cheeks, and utter many a groan.<br/>Long time have I been absent from the field,<br/>And they shall know it. Love me as thou may'st,<br/>Yet thwart me not, for I am fixt to go.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Whom Thetis answer'd, Goddess of the Deep.<br/>Thou hast well said, my son! it is no blame<br/>To save from threaten'd death our suffering friends.<br/>But thy magnificent and dazzling arms<br/>Are now in Trojan hands; them Hector wears<br/>Exulting, but ordain'd not long to exult,<br/>So habited; his death is also nigh.<br/>
