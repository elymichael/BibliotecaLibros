Loud shouted then Lycaon's son renown'd.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Rush on, ye Trojans, spur your coursers hard.<br/>Our fiercest foe is wounded, and I deem<br/>His death not distant far, if me the King<br/>Jove's son, indeed, from Lycia sent to Troy.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>So boasted Pandarus. Yet him the dart<br/>Quell'd not. Retreating, at his coursers' heads<br/>He stood, and to the son of Capaneus<br/>His charioteer and faithful friend he said.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Arise, sweet son of Capaneus, dismount,<br/>And from my shoulder draw this bitter shaft.<br/><br/>
