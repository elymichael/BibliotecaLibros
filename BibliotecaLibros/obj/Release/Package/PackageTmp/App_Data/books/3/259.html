<p>
To evil only and injurious deeds;<br/>There is not in Olympus, save herself,<br/>Who feels not thy control; but she her will<br/>Gratifies ever, and reproof from thee<br/>Finds none, because, pernicious as she is,<br/>She is thy daughter. She hath now the mind<br/>Of haughty Diomede with madness fill'd<br/>Against the immortal Gods; first Venus bled;<br/>Her hand he pierced impetuous, then assail'd,<br/>As if himself immortal, even me,<br/>But me my feet stole thence, or overwhelm'd<br/>Beneath yon heaps of carcases impure,<br/>What had I not sustain'd? And if at last<br/>I lived, had halted crippled by the sword.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>To whom with dark displeasure Jove replied.<br/>Base and side-shifting traitor! vex not me<br/>Here sitting querulous; of all who dwell<br/>On the Olympian heights, thee most I hate<br/>
