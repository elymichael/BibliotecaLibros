A noble gift, which yet the hoary King<br/>Spared not, such fervor of desire he felt<br/>To loose his son. Then from his portico,<br/>With angry taunts he drove the gather'd crowds.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Away! away! ye dregs of earth, away!<br/>Ye shame of human kind! Have ye no griefs<br/>At home, that ye come hither troubling<br/>me<br/>?<br/>Deem ye it little that Saturnian Jove<br/>Afflicts me thus, and of my very best,<br/>Best boy deprives me? Ah! ye shall be taught<br/>Yourselves that loss, far easier to be slain<br/>By the Achaians now, since he is dead.<br/>But I, ere yet the city I behold<br/>Taken and pillaged, with these aged eyes,<br/>Shall find safe hiding in the shades below.<br/><br/>
