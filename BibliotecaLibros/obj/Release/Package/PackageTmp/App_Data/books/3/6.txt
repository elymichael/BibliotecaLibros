paraphrase
, but it is no longer the same author only in a
different dress, and therefore it is not translation. Should a
painter, professing to draw the likeness of a beautiful woman, give
her more or fewer features than belong to her, and a general cast
of countenance of his own invention, he might be said to have
produced a
jeu d'esprit
, a curiosity perhaps in its way,
but by no means the lady in question.

It will however be necessary to speak a little more largely to
this subject, on which discordant opinions prevail even among good
judges.

The free and the close translation have, each, their advocates.
But inconveniences belong to both. The former can hardly be true to
the original author's style and manner, and the latter is apt to be
servile. The one loses his peculiarities, and the other his spirit.
Were it possible, therefore, to find an exact medium, a manner so
close that it should let slip nothing of the text, nor mingle any
thing extraneous with it, and at the same time so free as to have
an air of originality, this seems precisely the mode in which an
author might be best rendered. I can assure my readers from my own
experience, that to discover this very delicate line is difficult,
and to proceed by it when found, through the whole length of a poet
voluminous as Homer, nearly impossible. I can only pretend to have
endeavored it.

It is an opinion commonly received, but, like many others,
indebted for its prevalence to mere want of examination, that a
translator should imagine to himself the style which his author
would probably have used, had the language into which he is
rendered been his own. A direction which wants nothing but
practicability to recommend it. For suppose six persons, equally
qualified for the task, employed to translate the same Ancient into
their own language, with this rule to guide them. In the event it
would be found, that each had fallen on a manner different from
that of all the rest, and by probable inference it would follow
that none had fallen on the right. On the whole, therefore, as has
been said, the translation which partakes equally of fidelity and
liberality, that is close, but not so close as to ix
be servile, free, but not so free as to be
licentious, promises fairest; and my ambition will be sufficiently
gratified, if such of my readers as are able, and will take the
pains to compare me in this respect with Homer, shall judge that I
have in any measure attained a point so difficult.

As to energy and harmony, two grand requisites in a translation
of this most energetic and most harmonious of all poets, it is
neither my purpose nor my wish, should I be found deficient in
either, or in both, to shelter myself under an unfilial imputation
of blame to my mother-tongue. Our language is indeed less musical
than the Greek, and there is no language with which I am at all
acquainted that is not. But it is musical enough for the purposes
of melodious verse, and if it seem to fail, on whatsoever occasion,
in energy, the blame is due, not to itself, but to the unskilful
manager of it. For so long as Milton's works, whether his prose or
his verse, shall exist, so long there will be abundant proof that
no subject, however important, however sublime, can demand greater
force of expression than is within the compass of the English
language.

I have no fear of judges familiar with original Homer. They need
not be told that a translation of him is an arduous enterprise, and
as such, entitled to some favor. From these, therefore, I shall
expect, and shall not be disappointed, considerable candor and
allowance. Especially
they
will be candid, and I believe
that there are many such, who have occasionally tried their own
strength in this
bow of Ulysses
. They have not found it
supple and pliable, and with me are perhaps ready to acknowledge
that they could not always even approach with it the mark of their
ambition. But I would willingly, were it possible, obviate uncandid
criticism, because to answer it is lost labor, and to receive it in
silence has the appearance of stately reserve, and
self-importance.

To those, therefore, who shall be inclined to tell me hereafter
that my diction is often plain and unelevated, I reply beforehand
that I know it,â€”that it would be absurd were it otherwise, and that
Homer himself stands in the same predicament. In fact, it is one of
his numberless excellences, and a point in which his judgment never
fails him, that he is grand and lofty always in the right place,
and knows infallibly how to rise and fall with his subject.
