His arms gore-stain'd. Meantime the other sons
Of the Achaians, gathering fast around,
The bulk admired, and the proportion just
Of Hector; neither stood a Grecian there
Who pierced him not, and thus the soldier spake.

&#160;

Ye Gods! how far more patient of the touch
Is Hector now, than when he fired the fleet!

&#160;

Thus would they speak, then give him each a stab.
And now, the body stripp'd, their noble Chief
The swift Achilles standing in the midst,
The Grecians in wing'd accents thus address'd.

&#160;

Friends, Chiefs and Senators of Argos' host!
