<br/>By brave Idomeneus a Lydian died,<br/>Phæstus, from fruitful Tarne sent to Troy,<br/>Son of Mæonian Borus; him his steeds<br/>Mounting, Idomeneus the spear-renown'd<br/>Through his right shoulder pierced; unwelcome night<br/>Involved him; from his chariot down he fell,<br/>And the attendant Cretans stripp'd his arms.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>But Menelaus, son of Atreus slew<br/>With his bright spear Scamandrius, Stropius' son,<br/>A skilful hunter; for Diana him,<br/>Herself, the slaughter of all savage kinds<br/>Had taught, on mountain or in forest bred.<br/>But she, shaft-aiming Goddess, in that hour<br/>Avail'd him not, nor his own matchless skill;<br/>For Menelaus, Atreus son spear-famed,<br/>Him flying wounded in the spine between<br/>His shoulders, and the spear urged through his breast.<br/>
