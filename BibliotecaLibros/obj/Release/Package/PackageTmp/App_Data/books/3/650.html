Then Acamas around<br/>His brother stalking, wounded with his spear<br/>Bœotian Promachus, who by the feet<br/>Dragg'd off the slain. Acamas in his fall<br/>Aloud exulted with a boundless joy.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Vain-glorious Argives, archers inexpert!<br/>War's toil and trouble are not ours alone,<br/>But ye shall perish also; mark the man—<br/>How sound he sleeps tamed by my conquering arm,<br/>Your fellow-warrior Promachus! the debt<br/>Of vengeance on my brother's dear behalf<br/>Demanded quick discharge; well may the wish<br/>Of every dying warrior be to leave<br/>A brother living to avenge his fall.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>
