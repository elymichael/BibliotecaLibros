<br/>Big with great purposes and proud, they sat,<br/>Not disarray'd, but in fair form disposed<br/>Of even ranks, and watch'd their numerous fires,<br/>As when around the clear bright moon, the stars<br/>Shine in full splendor, and the winds are hush'd,<br/>The groves, the mountain-tops, the headland-heights<br/>Stand all apparent, not a vapor streaks<br/>The boundless blue, but ether open'd wide<br/>All glitters, and the shepherd's heart is cheer'd;<br/>So numerous seem'd those fires the bank between<br/>Of Xanthus, blazing, and the fleet of Greece,<br/>In prospect all of Troy; a thousand fires,<br/>Each watch'd by fifty warriors seated near.<br/>The steeds beside the chariots stood, their corn<br/>Chewing, and waiting till the golden-throned<br/>Aurora should restore the light of day.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
