My dazzling helmet, therefore bolder grown<br/>All Ilium comes abroad; but had I found<br/>Kindness at royal Agamemnon's hands,<br/>Soon had they fled, and with their bodies chok'd<br/>The streams, from whom ourselves now suffer siege<br/>For in the hands of Diomede his spear<br/>No longer rages rescuing from death<br/>The afflicted Danaï, nor hear I more<br/>The voice of Agamemnon issuing harsh<br/>From his detested throat, but all around<br/>The burst&#160;of homicidal Hector's cries,<br/>Calling his Trojans on; they loud insult<br/>The vanquish'd Greeks, and claim the field their own.<br/>Go therefore, my Patroclus; furious fall<br/>On these assailants, even now preserve<br/>From fire the only hope of our return.<br/>But hear the sum of all; mark well my word;<br/>So shalt thou glorify me in the eyes<br/>Of all the Danaï, and they shall yield<br/>Brisëis mine, with many a gift beside.<br/>The Trojans from the fleet expell'd, return.<br/>
