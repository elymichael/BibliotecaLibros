So shall they speak, and then shall I regret<br/>That I return'd ere I had slain in fight<br/>Achilles, or that, by Achilles slain,<br/>I died not nobly in defence of Troy.<br/>But shall I thus? Lay down my bossy shield,<br/>Put off my helmet, and my spear recline<br/>Against the city wall, then go myself<br/>To meet the brave Achilles, and at once<br/>Promise him Helen, for whose sake we strive<br/>With all the wealth that Paris in his fleet<br/>Brought home, to be restored to Atreus' sons,<br/>And to distribute to the Greeks at large<br/>All hidden treasures of the town, an oath<br/>Taking beside from every senator,<br/>That he will nought conceal, but will produce<br/>And share in just equality what stores<br/>Soever our fair city still includes?<br/>Ah airy speculations, questions vain!<br/>I may not sue to him: compassion none<br/>Will he vouchsafe me, or my suit respect.<br/>But, seeing me unarm'd, will sate at once<br/>
