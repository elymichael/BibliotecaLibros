&#160;<br/><br/>Ah! wo is me—why falls Achaia's host,<br/>With such disorder foul, back on the fleet?<br/>I tremble lest the Gods my anxious thoughts<br/>Accomplish and my mother's words, who erst<br/>Hath warn'd me, that the bravest and the best<br/>Of all my Myrmidons, while yet I live,<br/>Slain under Troy, must view the sun no more.<br/>Brave Menœtiades is, doubtless, slain.<br/>Unhappy friend! I bade thee oft, our barks<br/>Deliver'd once from hostile fires, not seek<br/>To cope in arms with Hector, but return.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>While musing thus he stood, the son approach'd<br/>Of noble Nestor, and with tears his cheeks<br/>Bedewing copious, his sad message told.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/>
