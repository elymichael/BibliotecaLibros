All sigh'd around; next, Hecuba began
Amid the women, thus, her sad complaint.

Breathe I forlorn of thee? Thou, night and day,
My glory wast in Ilium, thee her sons
And daughters, both, hail'd as their guardian God,
Conscious of benefits from thee received,
Whose life prolong'd should have advanced them all
To high renown. Vain boast! thou art no more.

Nought yet had heard, nor knew by sure report
