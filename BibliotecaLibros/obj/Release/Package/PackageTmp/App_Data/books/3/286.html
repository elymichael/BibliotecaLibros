Thou would'st resent to death. Haste, seek the field<br/>This moment, lest, the next, all Ilium blaze.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>To whom thus Paris, graceful as a God.<br/>Since, Hector, thou hast charged me with a fault,<br/>And not unjustly, I will answer make,<br/>And give thou special heed. That here I sit,<br/>The cause is sorrow, which I wish'd to soothe<br/>In secret, not displeasure or revenge.<br/>I tell thee also, that even now my wife<br/>Was urgent with me in most soothing terms<br/>That I would forth to battle; and myself,<br/>Aware that victory oft changes sides,<br/>That course prefer. Wait, therefore, thou awhile,<br/>'Till I shall dress me for the fight, or go<br/>Thou first, and I will overtake thee soon.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>
