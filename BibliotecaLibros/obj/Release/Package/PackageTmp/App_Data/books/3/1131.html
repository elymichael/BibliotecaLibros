Their steeds; the mules close follow'd with the dead.<br/>Nor warrior yet, nor cinctured matron knew<br/>Of all in Ilium aught of their approach,<br/>Cassandra sole except. She, beautiful<br/>As golden Venus, mounted on the height<br/>Of Pergamus, her father first discern'd,<br/>Borne on his chariot-seat erect, and knew:<br/>The herald heard so oft in echoing Troy;<br/>Him also on his bier outstretch'd she mark'd,<br/>Whom the mules drew. Then, shrieking, through the streets<br/>She ran of Troy, and loud proclaim'd the sight.<br/>Ye sons of Ilium and ye daughters, haste,<br/>Haste all to look on Hector, if ye e'er<br/>With joy beheld him, while he yet survived,<br/>From fight returning; for all Ilium erst<br/>In him, and all her citizens rejoiced.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>She spake. Then neither male nor female more<br/>In Troy remain'd, such sorrow seized on all.<br/>
