&#160;<br/><br/>So saying, he roused his spirit, and on fire<br/>To combat with the Cretan, forth he sprang.<br/>But fear seized not Idomeneus as fear<br/>May seize a nursling boy; resolved he stood<br/>As in the mountains, conscious of his force,<br/>The wild boar waits a coming multitude<br/>Of boisterous hunters to his lone retreat;<br/>Arching his bristly spine he stands, his eyes<br/>Beam fire, and whetting his bright tusks, he burns<br/>To drive, not dogs alone, but men to flight;<br/>So stood the royal Cretan, and fled not,<br/>Expecting brave Ã†neas; yet his friends<br/>He summon'd, on Ascalaphus his eyes<br/>Fastening, on Aphareus, Deipyrus,<br/>Meriones, and Antilochus, all bold<br/>In battle, and in accents wing'd exclaim'd.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>
