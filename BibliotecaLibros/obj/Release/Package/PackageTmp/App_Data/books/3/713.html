Hence springs, and hence alone, my grief of heart;<br/>If one, in nought superior to myself<br/>Save in his office only, should by force<br/>Amerce me of my well-earn'd recompense—<br/>How then? There lies the grief that stings my soul.<br/>The virgin chosen for me by the sons<br/>Of Greece, my just reward, by my own spear<br/>Obtain'd when I Eëtion's city took,<br/>Her, Agamemnon, leader of the host<br/>From my possession wrung, as I had been<br/>Some alien wretch, unhonor'd and unknown.<br/>But let it pass; anger is not a flame<br/>To feed for ever; I affirm'd, indeed,<br/>Mine inextinguishable till the shout<br/>Of battle should invade my proper barks;<br/>But thou put on my glorious arms, lead forth<br/>My valiant Myrmidons, since such a cloud,<br/>So dark, of dire hostility surrounds<br/>The fleet, and the Achaians, by the waves<br/>Hemm'd in, are prison'd now in narrow space.<br/>Because the Trojans meet not in the field<br/>
