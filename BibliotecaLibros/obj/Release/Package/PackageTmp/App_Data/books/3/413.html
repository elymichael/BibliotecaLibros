Of numerous cities; for a boar so vast<br/>Might not be vanquish'd by the power of few,<br/>And many to their funeral piles he sent.<br/>Then raised Diana clamorous dispute,<br/>And contest hot between them, all alike,<br/>Curetes and Ætolians fierce in arms<br/>The boar's head claiming, and his bristly hide.<br/>So long as warlike Meleager fought,<br/>Ætolia prosper'd, nor with all their powers<br/>Could the Curetes stand before the walls.<br/>But when resentment once had fired the heart<br/>Of Meleager, which hath tumult oft<br/>Excited in the breasts of wisest men,<br/>(For his own mother had his wrath provoked<br/>Althæa) thenceforth with his wedded wife<br/>He dwelt, fair Cleopatra, close retired.<br/>She was Marpessa's daughter, whom she bore<br/>To Idas, bravest warrior in his day<br/>Of all on earth. He fear'd not 'gainst the King<br/>Himself Apollo, for the lovely nymph<br/>Marpessa's sake, his spouse, to bend his bow.<br/>
