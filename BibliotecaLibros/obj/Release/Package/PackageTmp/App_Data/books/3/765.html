So moved the hero of the amber locks<br/>Around Patroclus, before whom his spear<br/>Advancing and broad shield, he death denounced<br/>On all opposers; neither stood the son<br/>Spear-famed of Panthus inattentive long<br/>To slain Patroclus, but approach'd the dead,<br/>And warlike Menelaus thus bespake.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Prince! Menelaus! Atreus' mighty son!<br/>Yield. Leave the body and these gory spoils;<br/>For of the Trojans or allies of Troy<br/>None sooner made Patroclus bleed than I.<br/>Seek not to rob me, therefore, of my praise<br/>Among the Trojans, lest my spear assail<br/>Thee also, and thou perish premature.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>To whom, indignant, Atreus' son replied.<br/>
