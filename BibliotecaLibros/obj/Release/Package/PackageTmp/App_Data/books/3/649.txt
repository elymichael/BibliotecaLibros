Shunn'd, starting sideward; but Antenor's son
Archilochus the mortal dint received,
Death-destined by the Gods; where neck and spine
Unite, both tendons he dissever'd wide,
And, ere his knees, his nostrils met the ground.

Then Ajax in his turn vaunting aloud
Against renown'd Polydamas, exclaim'd.
Speak now the truth, Polydamas, and weigh
My question well. His life whom I have slain
Makes it not compensation for the loss
Of Proth√∂enor's life! To me he seems
Nor base himself; nor yet of base descent,
But brother of Atenor steed-renown'd,
Or else perchance his son; for in my eyes
Antenor's lineage he resembles most.
