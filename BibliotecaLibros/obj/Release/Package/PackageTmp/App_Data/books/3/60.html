&#160;<br/><br/>So spake the Dream, and vanishing, him left<br/>In false hopes occupied and musings vain.<br/>Full sure he thought, ignorant of the plan<br/>By Jove design'd, that day the last of Troy.<br/>Fond thought! For toils and agonies to Greeks<br/>And Trojans both, in many a bloody field<br/>To be endured, the Thunderer yet ordain'd.<br/>Starting he woke, and seeming still to hear<br/>The warning voice divine, with hasty leap<br/>Sprang from his bed, and sat.&#160;His fleecy vest<br/>New-woven he put on, and mantle wide;<br/>His sandals fair to his unsullied feet<br/>He braced, and slung his argent-studded sword.<br/>Then, incorruptible for evermore<br/>The sceptre of his sires he took, with which<br/>He issued forth into the camp of Greece.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>
