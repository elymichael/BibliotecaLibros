And safest course, with all his boasted power,
Were to possess in peace his proper third.
Let him not seek to terrify with force
Me like a dastard; let him rather chide
His own-begotten; with big-sounding words
His sons and daughters govern, who perforce
Obey his voice, and shrink at his commands.

To whom thus Iris tempest-wing'd replied,
CÅ“rulean-tress'd Sovereign of the Deep!

Are flexible, and on the elder-born
Erynnis, with her vengeful sisters, waits.

&#160;

Her answer'd then the Shaker of the shores.
Prudent is thy advice, Iris divine!
