Sarpedon, vanquished by Patroclus, falls!<br/>So will the Fates. Yet, doubtful, much I muse<br/>Whether to place him, snatch'd from furious fight<br/>In Lycia's wealthy realm, or to permit<br/>His death by valiant Men≈ìtiades.<br/><br/>To whom his awful spouse, displeased, replied.<br/>How speaks the terrible Saturnian Jove!<br/>Wouldst thou again from pangs of death exempt<br/>A mortal man, destined long since to die?<br/>Do it. But small thy praise shall be in heaven,<br/>Mark thou my words, and in thy inmost breast<br/>Treasure them. If thou send Sarpedon safe<br/>To his own home, how many Gods<br/>their<br/>sons<br/>May also send from battle? Weigh it well.<br/>For under yon great city fight no few<br/>Sprung from Immortals whom thou shalt provoke.<br/>But if thou love him, and thine heart his lot<br/>Commiserate, leave him by the hands to fall<br/>
