ARGUMENT OF THE SIXTEENTH BOOK.

Achilles, at the suit of Patroclus, grants him his own armor,
and permission to lead the Myrmidons to battle. They, sallying,
repulse the Trojans. Patroclus slays Sarpedon, and Hector, when
Apollo had first stripped off his armor and Euphorbus wounded him,
slays Patroclus.

&#160;


Such contest for that gallant bark they waged.
Meantime Patroclus, standing at the side
Of the illustrious Chief Achilles, wept
Fast as a crystal fountain from the height
Of some rude rock pours down its rapid&#160;stream.
Divine Achilles with compassion moved
Mark'd him, and in wing'd accents thus began.
