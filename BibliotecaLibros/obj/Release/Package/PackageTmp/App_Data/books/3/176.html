Exulting, pass'd, and in his progress came<br/>Where stood each Ajax; them he found prepared<br/>With all their cloud of infantry behind.<br/>As when the goat-herd on some rocky point<br/>Advanced, a cloud sees wafted o'er the deep<br/>By western gales, and rolling slow along,<br/>To him, who stands remote, pitch-black it seems,<br/>And comes with tempest charged; he at the sight<br/>Shuddering, his flock compels into a cave;<br/>So moved the gloomy phalanx, rough with spears,<br/>And dense with shields of youthful warriors bold,<br/>Close-following either Ajax to the fight.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Them also, pleased, the King of men beheld,<br/>And in wing'd accents hail'd them as he pass'd.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Brave leaders of the mail-clad host of Greece!<br/>
