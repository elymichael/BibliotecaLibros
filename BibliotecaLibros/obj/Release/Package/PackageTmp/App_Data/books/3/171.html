Brave Menelaus, Atreus' son, for him<br/>Some archer, either Lycian or of Troy,<br/>A dexterous one, hath stricken with a shaft<br/>To his own glory, and to our distress.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>So saying, he roused Machaon, who his course<br/>Through the wide host began. Arriving soon<br/>Where wounded Menelaus stood, while all<br/>The bravest of Achaia's host around<br/>The godlike hero press'd, he strove at once<br/>To draw the arrow from his cincture forth.<br/>But, drawing, bent the barbs. He therefore loosed<br/>His broider'd belt, his hauberk and his quilt,<br/>Work of the armorer, and laying bare<br/>His body where the bitter shaft had plow'd<br/>His flesh, he suck'd the wound, then spread it o'er<br/>With drugs of balmy power, given on a time<br/>For friendship's sake by Chiron to his sire.<br/><br/>
