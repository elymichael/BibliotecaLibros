<br/>&#160;<br/><br/>To whom replied Jove, Sovereign of the storms,<br/>Thou know'st my council, Shaker of the shores!<br/>And wherefore ye are call'd. Although ordain'd<br/>So soon to die, they interest me still.<br/>Myself, here seated on Olympus' top,<br/>With contemplation will my mind indulge<br/>Of yon great spectacle; but ye, the rest,<br/>Descend into the field, Trojan or Greek<br/>Each to assist, as each shall most incline.<br/>For should Achilles in the field no foe<br/>Find save the Trojans, quickly should they fly<br/>Before the rapid force of Peleus' son.<br/>They trembled ever at his look, and since<br/>Such fury for his friend hath fired his heart,<br/>I fear lest he anticipate the will<br/>Of Fate, and Ilium perish premature.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/>
