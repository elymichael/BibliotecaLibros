ARGUMENT OF THE FOURTH BOOK.

In a Council of the Gods, a dispute arises between Jupiter and
Juno, which is at last compromised, Jove consenting to dispatch
Minerva with a charge to incite some Trojan to a violation of the
truce. Minerva descends for that purpose, and in the form of
Laodocus, a son of Priam, exhorts Pandarus to shoot at Menelaus,
and succeeds. Menelaus is wounded, and Agamemnon having consigned
him to the care of Machaon, goes forth to perform the duties of
commander-in-chief, in the encouragement of his host to battle. The
battle begins.

&#160;


Now, on the golden floor of Jove's abode
The Gods all sat consulting; Hebe them,
Graceful, with nectar served;&#160;they pledging each
His next, alternate quaff'd from cups of gold,
And at their ease reclined, look'd down on Troy,
When, sudden, Jove essay'd by piercing speech
Invidious, to enkindle Juno's ire.
