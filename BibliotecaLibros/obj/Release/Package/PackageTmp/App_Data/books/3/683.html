Their Trojan foes to tread the Grecians down!<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>So Nestor pray'd, and Jove thunder'd aloud<br/>Responsive to the old Neleïan's prayer.<br/>But when that voice of Ægis-bearing Jove<br/>The Trojans heard, more furious on the Greeks<br/>They sprang, all mindful of the fight. As when<br/>A turgid billow of some spacious sea,<br/>While the wind blow that heaves its highest, borne<br/>Sheer o'er the vessel's side, rolls into her,<br/>With such loud roar the Trojans pass'd the wall;<br/>In rush'd the steeds, and at the ships they waged<br/>Fierce battle hand to hand, from chariots, these,<br/>With spears of double edge, those, from the decks<br/>Of many a sable bark, with naval poles<br/>Long, ponderous, shod with steel; for every ship<br/>Had such, for conflict maritime prepared.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/>
