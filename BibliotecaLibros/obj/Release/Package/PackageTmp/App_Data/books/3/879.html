But haste, now take refreshment; though, in truth<br/>Might I direct, the host should by all means<br/>Unfed to battle, and at set of sun<br/>All sup together, this affront revenged.<br/>But as for me, no drop shall pass my lips<br/>Or morsel, whose companion lies with feet<br/>Turn'd to the vestibule, pierced by the spear,<br/>And compass'd by my weeping train around.<br/>No want of food feel I. My wishes call<br/>For carnage, blood, and agonies and groans.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>But him, excelling in all wisdom, thus<br/>Ulysses answer'd. Oh Achilles! son<br/>Of Peleus! bravest far of all our host!<br/>Me, in no scanty measure, thou excell'st<br/>Wielding the spear, and thee in prudence, I<br/>Not less. For I am elder, and have learn'd<br/>What thou hast yet to learn. Bid then thine heart<br/>Endure with patience to be taught by me.<br/>
