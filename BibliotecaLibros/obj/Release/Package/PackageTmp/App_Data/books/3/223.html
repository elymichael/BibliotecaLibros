<br/>My darling child! who? which of all the Gods<br/>Hath rashly done such violence to thee<br/>As if convicted of some open wrong?<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Her then the Goddess of love-kindling smiles<br/>Venus thus answer'd; Diomede the proud,<br/>Audacious Diomede; he gave the wound,<br/>For that I stole Ã†neas from the fight<br/>My son of all mankind my most beloved;<br/>Nor is it now the war of Greece with Troy,<br/>But of the Grecians with the Gods themselves.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Then thus Dione, Goddess all divine.<br/>My child! how hard soe'er thy sufferings seem<br/>Endure them patiently. Full many a wrong<br/>From human hands profane the Gods endure,<br/>
