His daughter valiant Hector had espoused.<br/>There she encounter'd him, and with herself<br/>The nurse came also, bearing in her arms<br/>Hectorides, his infant darling boy,<br/>Beautiful as a star. Him Hector called<br/>Scamandrios, but Astyanax&#160;all else<br/>In Ilium named him, for that Hector's arm<br/>Alone was the defence and strength of Troy.<br/>The father, silent, eyed his babe, and smiled.<br/>Andromache, meantime, before him stood,<br/>With streaming cheeks, hung on his hand, and said.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Thy own great courage will cut short thy days,<br/>My noble Hector! neither pitiest thou<br/>Thy helpless infant, or my hapless self,<br/>Whose widowhood is near; for thou wilt fall<br/>Ere long, assail'd by the whole host of Greece.<br/>Then let me to the tomb, my best retreat<br/>When thou art slain. For comfort none or joy<br/>
