Give me, that they may bear me to the heights<br/>Olympian, seat of the immortal Gods!<br/>Oh! I am wounded deep; a mortal man<br/>Hath done it, Diomede; nor would he fear<br/>This day in fight the Sire himself of all.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Then Mars his coursers gold-caparison'd<br/>Resign'd to Venus; she, with countenance sad,<br/>The chariot climb'd, and Iris at her side<br/>The bright reins seizing lash'd the ready steeds.<br/>Soon as the Olympian heights, seat of the Gods,<br/>They reach'd, wing-footed Iris loosing quick<br/>The coursers, gave them large whereon to browse<br/>Ambrosial food; but Venus on the knees<br/>Sank of Dione, who with folded arms<br/>Maternal, to her bosom straining close<br/>Her daughter, stroked her cheek, and thus inquired.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/>
