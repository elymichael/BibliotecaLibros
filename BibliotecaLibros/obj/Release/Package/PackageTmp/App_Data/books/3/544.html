So saying he led them, who with deafening roar<br/>Follow'd him. Then, from the Id√¶an hills<br/>Jove hurl'd a storm which wafted right the dust<br/>Into the fleet; the spirits too he quell'd<br/>Of the Achaians, and the glory gave<br/>To Hector and his host; they, trusting firm<br/>In signs from Jove, and in their proper force,<br/>Assay'd the barrier; from the towers they tore<br/>The galleries, cast the battlements to ground,<br/>And the projecting buttresses adjoin'd<br/>To strengthen the vast work, with bars upheaved.<br/>All these, with expectation fierce to break<br/>The rampart, down they drew; nor yet the Greeks<br/>Gave back, but fencing close with shields the wall,<br/>Smote from behind them many a foe beneath.<br/>Meantime from tower to tower the Ajaces moved<br/>Exhorting all; with mildness some, and some<br/>With harsh rebuke, whom they observed through fear<br/>Declining base the labors of the fight,<br/><br/>&#160;<br/>
