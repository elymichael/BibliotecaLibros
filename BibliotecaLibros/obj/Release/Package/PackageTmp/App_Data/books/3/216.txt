With swiftest pace approach'd, and first his speech
To Diomede Lycaon's son address'd.

&#160;

Heroic offspring of a noble sire,
Brave son of Tydeus! false to my intent
My shaft hath harm'd thee little. I will now
Make trial with my spear, if that may speed.

&#160;

He said, and shaking his long-shadow'd spear,
Dismiss'd it. Forceful on the shield it struck
Of Diomede, transpierced it, and approach'd
With threatening point the hauberk on his breast.
Loud shouted Pandarusâ€”Ah nobly thrown!
Home to thy bowels. Die, for die thou must,
And all the glory of thy death is mine.

&#160;
