He then, retiring slow, and turning oft,
Forsook the body. As by dogs and swains
With clamors loud and spears driven from the stalls
A bearded lion goes, his noble heart
Abhors retreat, and slow he quits the prey;
So Menelaus with slow steps forsook
Patroclus, and arrived in front, at length,
Of his own phalanx, stood, with sharpen'd eyes
Seeking vast Ajax, son of Telamon.
Him leftward, soon, of all the field he mark'd
Encouraging aloud his band, whose hearts
With terrors irresistible himself
Phœbus had fill'd. He ran, and at his side
Standing, incontinent him thus bespake.

&#160;

My gallant Ajax, haste—come quickly—strive
With me to rescue for Achilles' sake
His friend, though bare, for Hector hath his arms.
