ARGUMENT OF THE FIRST BOOK.

The book opens with an account of a pestilence that prevailed in
the Grecian camp, and the cause of it is assigned. A council is
called, in which fierce altercation takes place between Agamemnon
and Achilles. The latter solemnly renounces the field. Agamemnon,
by his heralds, demands BrisÃ«is, and Achilles resigns her. He makes
his complaint to Thetis, who undertakes to plead his cause with
Jupiter. She pleads it, and prevails. The book concludes with an
account of what passed in Heaven on that occasion.

BOOK I.


Achilles sing, O Goddess! Peleus' son;
His wrath pernicious, who ten thousand woes
Caused to Achaia's host, sent many a soul
Illustrious into Ades premature,
And Heroes gave (so stood the will of Jove)
