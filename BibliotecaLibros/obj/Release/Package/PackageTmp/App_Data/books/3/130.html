Talthybius to the Grecian fleet dismiss'd<br/>For a third lamb to Jove; nor he the voice<br/>Of noble Agamemnon disobey'd.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Iris, ambassadress of heaven, the while,<br/>To Helen came. Laödice she seem'd,<br/>Loveliest of all the daughters of the house<br/>Of Priam, wedded to Antenor's son,<br/>King Helicäon. Her she found within,<br/>An ample web magnificent she wove,<br/>Inwrought with numerous conflicts for her sake<br/>Beneath the hands of Mars endured by Greeks<br/>Mail-arm'd, and Trojans of equestrian fame.<br/>Swift Iris, at her side, her thus address'd.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Haste, dearest nymph! a wondrous sight behold!<br/>Greeks brazen-mail'd, and Trojans steed-renown'd.<br/>
