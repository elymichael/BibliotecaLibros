&#160;<br/><br/>So spake the seer, and as he spake, is done.<br/>Wait, therefore, brave Achaians! go not hence<br/>Till Priam's spacious city be your prize.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>He ceased, and such a shout ensued, that all<br/>The hollow ships the deafening roar return'd<br/>Of acclamation, every voice the speech<br/>Extolling of Ulysses, glorious Chief.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Then Nestor the Gerenian,&#160;warrior old,<br/>Arising, spake; and, by the Gods, he said,<br/>Ye more resemble children inexpert<br/>In war, than disciplined and prudent men.<br/>Where now are all your promises and vows,<br/>Councils, libations, right-hand covenants?<br/>
