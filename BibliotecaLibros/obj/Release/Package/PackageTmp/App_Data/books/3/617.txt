There lying in the tent, the shield well-forged
Of valiant Thrasymedes, his own son

Stood forth before the tent. Thence soon he saw
Foul deeds and strange, the Grecian host confused,
Their broken ranks flying before the host
Of Ilium, and the rampart overthrown.
As when the wide sea, darken'd over all
