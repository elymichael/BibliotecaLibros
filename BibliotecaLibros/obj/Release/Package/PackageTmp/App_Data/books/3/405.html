<p>
To my beloved country, I renounce<br/>The illustrious meed of glory, but obtain<br/>Secure and long immunity from death.<br/>And truly I would recommend to all<br/>To voyage homeward, for the fall as yet<br/>Ye shall not see of Ilium's lofty towers,<br/>For that the Thunderer with uplifted arm<br/>Protects her, and her courage hath revived.<br/>Bear ye mine answer back, as is the part<br/>Of good ambassadors, that they may frame<br/>Some likelier plan, by which both fleet and host<br/>May be preserved; for, my resentment still<br/>Burning, this project is but premature.<br/>Let Ph≈ìnix stay with us, and sleep this night<br/>Within my tent, that, if he so incline,<br/>He may to-morrow in my fleet embark,<br/>And hence attend me; but I leave him free.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>He ended; they astonish'd at his tone<br/>
