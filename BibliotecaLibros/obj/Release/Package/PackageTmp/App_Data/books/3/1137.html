To soothe them; therefore, with the same sad drops<br/>Thy fate, oh Hector! and my own I weep;<br/>For other friend within the ample bounds<br/>Of Ilium have I none, nor hope to hear<br/>Kind word again, with horror view'd by all.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>So Helen spake weeping, to whom with groans<br/>The countless multitude replied, and thus<br/>Their ancient sovereign next his people charged.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Ye Trojans, now bring fuel home, nor fear<br/>Close ambush of the Greeks; Achilles' self<br/>Gave me, at my dismission from his fleet,<br/>Assurance, that from hostile force secure<br/>We shall remain, till the twelfth dawn arise.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/>
