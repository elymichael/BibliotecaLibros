Celestial archer! be it so. I came<br/>Myself so purposing into the field<br/>From the Olympian heights. But by what means<br/>Wilt thou induce the warriors to a pause?<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>To whom the King, the son of Jove, replied.<br/>The courage of equestrian Hector bold<br/>Let us excite, that he may challenge forth<br/>To single conflict terrible some chief<br/>Achaian. The Achaians brazen-mail'd<br/>Indignant, will supply a champion soon<br/>To combat with the noble Chief of Troy.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>So spake Apollo, and his counsel pleased<br/>Minerva; which when Helenus the seer,<br/>Priam's own son, in his prophetic soul<br/>Perceived, approaching Hector, thus he spake.<br/>
