Them, when next thy wrath<br/>Shall be inflamed against them, lay thou waste;<br/>I will not interpose on their behalf;<br/>Thou shalt not hear me murmur; what avail<br/>Complaint or force against thy matchless arm?<br/>Yet were it most unmeet that even I<br/>Should toil in vain; I also boast a birth<br/>Celestial; Saturn deeply wise, thy Sire,<br/>Is also mine; our origin is one.<br/>Thee I acknowledge Sovereign, yet account<br/>Myself entitled by a twofold claim<br/>To veneration both from Gods and men,<br/>The daughter of Jove's sire, and spouse of Jove.<br/>Concession mutual therefore both thyself<br/>Befits and me, whom when the Gods perceive<br/>Disposed to peace, they also shall accord.<br/>
