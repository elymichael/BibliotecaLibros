The gifts arrive, and oaths of peace be sworn.<br/>To thee I give it in peculiar charge<br/>That choosing forth the most illustrious youths<br/>Of all Achaia, thou produce the gifts<br/>from my own ship, all those which yesternight<br/>We promised, nor the women leave behind.<br/>And let Talthybius throughout all the camp<br/>Of the Achaians, instant, seek a boar<br/>For sacrifice to Jove and to the Sun.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Then thus Achilles matchless in the race.<br/>Atrides! most illustrious! King of men!<br/>Expedience bids us to these cares attend<br/>Hereafter, when some pause, perchance, of fight<br/>Shall happen, and the martial rage which fires<br/>My bosom now, shall somewhat less be felt.<br/>Our friends by Priameian Hector slain,<br/>Now strew the field mangled, for him hath Jove<br/>Exalted high, and given him great renown.<br/>
