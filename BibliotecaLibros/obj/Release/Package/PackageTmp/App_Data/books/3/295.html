Shall bleed afresh through want of such a friend<br/>To stand between captivity and thee.<br/>But may I rest beneath my hill of earth<br/>Or ere that day arrive! I would not live<br/>To hear thy cries, and see thee torn away.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>So saying, illustrious Hector stretch'd his arms<br/>Forth to his son, but with a scream, the child<br/>Fell back into the bosom of his nurse,<br/>His father's aspect dreading, whose bright arms<br/>He had attentive mark'd and shaggy crest<br/>Playing tremendous o'er his helmet's height.<br/>His father and his gentle mother laugh'd,<br/>And noble Hector lifting from his head<br/>His dazzling helmet, placed it on the ground,<br/>Then kiss'd his boy and dandled him, and thus<br/>In earnest prayer the heavenly powers implored.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/>
