Its silent flood, forebodes shrill winds to blow,<br/>The doubtful waves roll yet to neither side,<br/>Till swept at length by a decisive gale;<br/>So stood the senior, with distressful doubts<br/>Conflicting anxious, whether first to seek<br/>The Grecian host, or Agamemnon's self<br/>The sovereign, and at length that course preferr'd.<br/>Meantime with mutual carnage they the field<br/>Spread far and wide, and by spears double-edged<br/>Smitten, and by the sword their corselets rang.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>The royal Chiefs ascending from the fleet,<br/>Ulysses, Diomede, and Atreus' son<br/>Imperial Agamemnon, who had each<br/>Bled in the battle, met him on his way.<br/>For from the war remote they had updrawn<br/>Their galleys on the shore of the gray Deep,<br/>The foremost to the plain, and at the sterns<br/>Of that exterior line had built the wall.<br/>
