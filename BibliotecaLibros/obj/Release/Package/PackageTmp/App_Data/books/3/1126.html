&#160;<br/><br/>Hero! dismiss us now each to our bed,<br/>That there at ease reclined, we may enjoy<br/>Sweet sleep; for never have these eyelids closed<br/>Since Hector fell and died, but without cease<br/>I mourn, and nourishing unnumber'd woes,<br/>Have roll'd me in the ashes of my courts.<br/>But I have now both tasted food, and given<br/>Wine to my lips, untasted till with thee.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>So he, and at his word Achilles bade<br/>His train beneath his portico prepare<br/>With all dispatch two couches, purple rugs,<br/>And arras, and warm mantles over all.<br/>Forth went the women bearing lights, and spread<br/>A couch for each, when feigning needful fear,<br/>Achilles thus his speech to Priam turn'd.<br/><br/>
