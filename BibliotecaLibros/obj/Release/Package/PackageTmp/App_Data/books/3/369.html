Minerva, through displeasure against Jove,<br/>Nought utter'd, for her bosom boil'd with rage;<br/>But Juno check'd not hers, who thus replied.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>What word hath pass'd thy lips, Jove most severe?<br/>We know thy force resistless; yet our hearts<br/>Feel not the less when we behold the Greeks<br/>Exhausting all the sorrows of their lot.<br/>If thou command, we doubtless will abstain<br/>From battle, yet such counsel to the Greeks<br/>Suggesting still, as may in part effect<br/>Their safety, lest thy wrath consume them all.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Then answer, thus, cloud-gatherer Jove return'd.<br/>Look forth, imperial Juno, if thou wilt,<br/>To-morrow at the blush of earliest dawn,<br/>And thou shalt see Saturn's almighty son<br/>
