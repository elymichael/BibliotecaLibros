Dread rang the brazen corselet, each his foe<br/>Assailing opposite; but two, the rest<br/>Surpassing far, terrible both as Mars,<br/>Æneas and Idomeneus, alike<br/>Panted to pierce each other with the spear.<br/>Æneas, first, cast at Idomeneus,<br/>But, warn'd, he shunn'd the weapon, and it pass'd.<br/>Quivering in the soil Æneas' lance<br/>Stood, hurl'd in vain, though by a forceful arm.<br/>Not so the Cretan; at his waist he pierced<br/>Oenomaüs, his hollow corselet clave,<br/>And in his midmost bowels drench'd the spear;<br/>Down fell the Chief, and dying, clench'd the dust.<br/>Instant, his massy spear the King of Crete<br/>Pluck'd from the dead, but of his radiant arms<br/>Despoil'd him not, by numerous weapons urged;<br/>For now, time-worn, he could no longer make<br/>Brisk sally, spring to follow his own spear,<br/>Or shun another, or by swift retreat<br/>Vanish from battle, but the evil day<br/>Warded in stationary fight alone.<br/>
