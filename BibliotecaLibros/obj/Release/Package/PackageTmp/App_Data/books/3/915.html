And thinnest the ox-hide. The Pelian ash<br/>Started right through the buckler, and it rang.<br/>Æneas crouch'd terrified, and his shield<br/>Thrust farther from him; but the rapid beam<br/>Bursting both borders of the ample disk,<br/>Glanced o'er his back, and plunged into the soil.<br/>He 'scaped it, and he stood; but, as he stood,<br/>With horror infinite the weapon saw<br/>Planted so near him. Then, Achilles drew<br/>His falchion keen, and with a deafening shout<br/>Sprang on him; but Æneas seized a stone<br/>Heavy and huge, a weight to overcharge<br/>Two men (such men as are accounted strong<br/>Now) but he wielded it with ease, alone.<br/>Then had Æneas, as Achilles came<br/>Impetuous on, smitten, although in vain,<br/>His helmet or his shield, and Peleus' son<br/>Had with his falchion him stretch'd at his feet,<br/>But that the God of Ocean quick perceived<br/>His peril, and the Immortals thus bespake.<br/><br/>
