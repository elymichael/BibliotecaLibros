<br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Whom thus Achilles interrupted fierce.<br/>Could I be found so abject as to take<br/>The measure of my doings at thy lips,<br/>Well might they call me coward through the camp,<br/>A vassal, and a fellow of no worth.<br/>Give law to others. Think not to control<br/>Me, subject to thy proud commands no more.<br/>Hear yet again! And weigh what thou shalt hear.<br/>I will not strive with thee in such a cause,<br/>Nor yet with any man; I scorn to fight<br/>For her, whom having given, ye take away.<br/>But I have other precious things on board;<br/>Of those take none away without my leave.<br/>Or if it please thee, put me to the proof<br/>Before this whole assembly, and my spear<br/>Shall stream that moment, purpled with thy blood.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/>
