Past remedy and havoc had ensued,<br/>Then had the routed Grecians, flying, sought<br/>Their ships again, but that Ulysses&#160;thus<br/>Summon'd the brave Tydides to his aid.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Whence comes it, Diomede, that we forget<br/>Our wonted courage? Hither, O my friend!<br/>And, fighting at my side, ward off the shame<br/>That must be ours, should Hector seize the fleet.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>To whom the valiant Diomede replied.<br/>I will be firm; trust me thou shalt not find<br/>Me shrinking; yet small fruit of our attempts<br/>Shall follow, for the Thunderer, not to us,<br/>But to the Trojan, gives the glorious day.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/>
