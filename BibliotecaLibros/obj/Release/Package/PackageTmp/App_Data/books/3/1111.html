His corse remains. Thou wouldst, thyself, admire<br/>Seeing how fresh the dew-drops, as he lies,<br/>Rest on him, and his blood is cleansed away<br/>That not a stain is left. Even his wounds<br/>(For many a wound they gave him) all are closed,<br/>Such care the blessed Gods have of thy son,<br/>Dead as he is, whom living much they loved.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>So he; then, glad, the ancient King replied.<br/>Good is it, oh my son! to yield the Gods<br/>Their just demands. My boy, while yet he lived,<br/>Lived not unmindful of the worship due<br/>To the Olympian powers, who, therefore, him<br/>Remember, even in the bands of death.<br/>Come then—this beauteous cup take at my hand—<br/>Be thou my guard, and, if the Gods permit,<br/>My guide, till to Achilles' tent I come.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/>
