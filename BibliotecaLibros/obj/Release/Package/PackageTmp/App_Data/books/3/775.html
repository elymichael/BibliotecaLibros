Thee and thy city profited, whom dead<br/>Thou fear'st to rescue even from the dogs.<br/>Now, therefore, may but my advice prevail,<br/>Back to your country, Lycians! so, at once,<br/>Shall remediless ruin fall on Troy.<br/>For had the Trojans now a daring heart<br/>Intrepid, such as in the breast resides<br/>Of laborers in their country's dear behalf,<br/>We soon should drag Patroclus into Troy;<br/>And were his body, from the battle drawn,<br/>In Priam's royal city once secured,<br/>As soon, the Argives would in ransom give<br/>Sarpedon's body with his splendid arms<br/>To be conducted safe into the town.<br/>For when Patroclus fell, the friend was slain<br/>Of such a Chief as is not in the fleet<br/>For valor, and his bands are dauntless all.<br/>But thou, at the first glimpse of Ajax' eye<br/>Confounded, hast not dared in arms to face<br/>That warrior bold, superior far to thee.<br/><br/>
