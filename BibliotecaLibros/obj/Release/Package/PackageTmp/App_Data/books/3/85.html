Of Tydeus, with Ulysses sixth and last,<br/>Jove's peer in wisdom. Menelaus went,<br/>Heroic Chief! unbidden, for he knew<br/>His brother's mind with weight of care oppress'd.<br/>The ox encircling, and their hands with meal<br/>Of consecration fill'd, the assembly stood,<br/>When Agamemnon thus his prayer preferred.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Almighty Father! Glorious above all!<br/>Cloud-girt, who dwell'st in heaven thy throne sublime,<br/>Let not the sun go down, till Priam's roof<br/>Fall flat into the flames; till I shall burn<br/>His gates with fire; till I shall hew away<br/>His hack'd and riven corslet from the breast<br/>Of Hector, and till numerous Chiefs, his friends,<br/>Around him, prone in dust, shall bite the ground.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>
