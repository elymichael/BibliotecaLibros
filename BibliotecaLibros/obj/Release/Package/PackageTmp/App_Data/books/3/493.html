But well beware<br/>Our next encounter, for if also me<br/>Some God befriend, thou diest. Now will I seek<br/>Another mark, and smite whom next I may.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>He spake, and of his armor stripp'd the son<br/>Spear-famed of Pæon. Meantime Paris, mate<br/>Of beauteous Helen, drew his bow against<br/>Tydides; by a pillar of the tomb<br/>Of Ilus, ancient senator revered,<br/>Conceal'd he stood, and while the Hero loosed<br/>His corselet from the breast of Pæon's son<br/>Renown'd, and of his helmet and his targe<br/>Despoil'd him; Paris, arching quick his bow,<br/>No devious shaft dismiss'd, but his right foot<br/>Pierced through the sole, and fix'd it to the ground.<br/>
