<br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Thus Nestor, and his mind bent to his words.<br/>Back to Æacides through all the camp<br/>He ran; and when, still running, he arrived<br/>Among Ulysses' barks, where they had fix'd<br/>The forum, where they minister'd the laws,<br/>And had erected altars to the Gods,<br/>There him Eurypylus, Evæmon's son,<br/>Illustrious met, deep-wounded in his thigh,<br/>And halting-back from battle. From his head<br/>The sweat, and from his shoulders ran profuse,<br/>And from his perilous wound the sable blood<br/>Continual stream'd; yet was his mind composed.<br/>Him seeing, Menœtiades the brave<br/>Compassion felt, and mournful, thus began.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Ah hapless senators and Chiefs of Greece!<br/>
