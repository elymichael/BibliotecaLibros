Or not interpreted, or kept concealed,<br/>Them saved not, for by Diomede they died.<br/>Xanthus and Thöon he encounter'd next,<br/>Both sons of Phænops, sons of his old age,<br/>Who other heir had none of all his wealth,<br/>Nor hoped another, worn with many years.<br/>Tydides slew them both; nor aught remain'd<br/>To the old man but sorrow for his sons<br/>For ever lost, and strangers were his heirs.<br/>Two sons of Priam in one chariot borne<br/>Echemon next, and Chromius felt his hand<br/>Resistless. As a lion on the herd<br/>Leaping, while they the shrubs and bushes browse,<br/>Breaks short the neck of heifer or of steer,<br/>So them, though clinging fast and loth to fall,<br/>Tydides hurl'd together to the ground,<br/>Then stripp'd their splendid armor, and the steeds<br/>Consigned and chariot to his soldiers' care.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>
