&#160;<br/><br/>While Menelaus thus the cares engross'd<br/>Of all those Chiefs, the shielded powers of Troy<br/>'Gan move toward them, and the Greeks again<br/>Put on their armor, mindful of the fight.<br/>Then hadst thou&#160;not great Agamemnon seen<br/>Slumbering, or trembling, or averse from war,<br/>But ardent to begin his glorious task.<br/>His steeds, and his bright chariot brass-inlaid<br/>He left; the snorting steeds Eurymedon,<br/>Offspring of Ptolemy Pira√Ødes<br/>Detain'd apart; for him he strict enjoin'd<br/>Attendance near, lest weariness of limbs<br/>Should seize him marshalling his numerous host.<br/>So forth he went, and through the files on foot<br/>Proceeding, where the warrior Greeks he saw<br/>Alert, he roused them by his words the more.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>
