Wind-footed Iris to the Trojans came.<br/>It was the time of council, when the throng<br/>At Priam's gate assembled, young and old:<br/>Them, standing nigh, the messenger of heaven<br/>Accosted with the voice of Priam's son,<br/>Polites. He, confiding in his speed<br/>For sure deliverance, posted was abroad<br/>On Ã†syeta's tomb,&#160;intent to watch<br/>When the Achaian host should leave the fleet.<br/>The Goddess in his form thus them address'd.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Oh, ancient Monarch! Ever, evermore<br/>Speaking, debating, as if all were peace;<br/>I have seen many a bright-embattled field,<br/>But never one so throng'd as this to-day.<br/>For like the leaves, or like the sands they come<br/>Swept by the winds, to gird the city round.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/>
