&#160;<br/><br/>Next, fierce as Mars, Pyl√¶menes they slew,<br/>Prince of the shielded band magnanimous<br/>Of Paphlagonia. Him Atrides kill'd<br/>Spear-practised Menelaus, with a lance<br/>His throat transpiercing while erect he rode.<br/>Then, while his charioteer, Mydon the brave,<br/>Son of Atymnias, turn'd his steeds to flight,<br/>Full on his elbow-point Antilochus,<br/>The son of Nestor, dash'd him with a stone.<br/>The slack reins, white as ivory,&#160;forsook<br/>His torpid hand and trail'd the dust. At once<br/>Forth sprang Antilochus, and with his sword<br/>Hew'd deep his temples. On his head he pitch'd<br/>Panting, and on his shoulders in the sand<br/>(For in deep sand he fell) stood long erect,<br/>Till his own coursers spread him in the dust;<br/>The son of Nestor seized, and with his scourge<br/>Drove them afar into the host of Greece.<br/><br/>
