Of Phœnops, valiant Phorcys, while he stood<br/>Guarding Hippothöus; through his hollow mail<br/>Enforced the weapon drank his inmost life,<br/>And in his palm, supine, he clench'd the dust.<br/>Then, Hector with the foremost Chiefs of Troy<br/>Fell back; the Argives sent a shout to heaven,<br/>And dragging Phorcys and Hippothöus thence<br/>Stripp'd both. In that bright moment Ilium's host<br/>Fear-quell'd before Achaia's warlike sons<br/>Had Troy re-enter'd, and the host of Greece<br/>By matchless might and fortitude their own<br/>Had snatch'd a victory from the grasp of fate,<br/>But that, himself, the King of radiant shafts<br/>Æneas roused; Epytis' son he seem'd<br/>Periphas, ancient in the service grown<br/>Of old Anchises whom he dearly loved;<br/>His form assumed, Apollo thus began.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>How could ye save, Æneas, were the Gods<br/>
