He ended; nor his spouse white-arm'd refused
Obedience, but from the Id√¶an heights
Departing, to the Olympian summit soar'd.
Swift as the traveller's thought,&#160;who, many a land
Traversed, deliberates on his future course
Uncertain, and his mind sends every way,
So swift updarted Juno to the skies.
Arrived on the Olympian heights, she found
The Gods assembled; they, at once, their seats
At her approach forsaking, with full cups
Her coming hail'd; heedless of all beside,
She took the cup from blooming Themis' hand,
For she first flew to welcome her, and thus
In accents wing'd of her return inquired.

&#160;

Say, Juno, why this sudden re-ascent?
Thou seem'st dismay'd; hath Saturn's son, thy spouse,
Driven thee affrighted to the skies again?
