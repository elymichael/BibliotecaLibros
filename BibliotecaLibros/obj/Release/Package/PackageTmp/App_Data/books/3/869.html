Clench'd with his teeth the ground, victim, alas!<br/>Of my revenge; whence triumph hath accrued<br/>To Hector and his host, while ours have cause<br/>For long remembrance of our mutual strife.<br/>But evils past let pass, yielding perforce<br/>To sad necessity. My wrath shall cease<br/>Now; I resign it; it hath burn'd too long.<br/>Thou therefore summon forth the host to fight,<br/>That I may learn meeting them in the field,<br/>If still the Trojans purpose at our fleet<br/>To watch us this night also. But I judge<br/>That driven by my spear to rapid flight,<br/>They shall escape with weary limbs&#160;at least.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>He ended, and the Grecians brazen-greaved<br/>Rejoiced that Peleus' mighty son had cast<br/>His wrath aside. Then not into the midst<br/>Proceeding, but at his own seat, upstood<br/>King Agamemnon, and them thus bespake.<br/>
