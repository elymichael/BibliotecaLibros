Disabled; break their chariot, dash themselves<br/>Headlong, and ten whole years shall not efface<br/>The wounds by my avenging bolts impress'd.<br/>So shall my blue-eyed daughter learn to dread<br/>A father's anger; but for the offence<br/>Of Juno, I resent it less; for she<br/>Clashes&#160;with all my counsels from of old.<br/>He ended; Iris with a tempest's speed<br/>From the Id√¶an summit soar'd at once<br/>To the Olympian; at the open gates<br/>Exterior of the mountain many-valed<br/>She stayed them, and her coming thus declared.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Whither, and for what cause? What rage is this?<br/>Ye may not aid the Grecians; Jove forbids;<br/>The son of Saturn threatens, if ye force<br/>His wrath by perseverance into act,<br/>That he will smite your steeds, and they shall halt<br/>Disabled; break your chariot, dash yourselves<br/>
