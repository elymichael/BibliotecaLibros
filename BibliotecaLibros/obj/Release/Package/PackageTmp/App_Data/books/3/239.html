&#160;<br/><br/>Them Hector through the ranks espying, flew<br/>With clamor loud to meet them; after whom<br/>Advanced in phalanx firm the powers of Troy,<br/>Mars led them, with Enyo terror-clad;<br/>She by the maddening tumult of the fight<br/>Attended, he, with his enormous spear<br/>in both hands brandish'd, stalking now in front<br/>Of Hector, and now following his steps.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Him Diomede the bold discerning, felt<br/>Himself no small dismay; and as a man<br/>Wandering he knows not whither, far from home,<br/>If chance a rapid torrent to the sea<br/>Borne headlong thwart his course, the foaming flood<br/>Obstreperous views awhile, then quick retires,<br/>So he, and his attendants thus bespake.<br/><br/>
