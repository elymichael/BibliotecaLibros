&#160;<br/><br/>Fool! speak'st of ransom? Name it not to me.<br/>For till my friend his miserable fate<br/>Accomplish'd, I was somewhat given to spare,<br/>And numerous, whom I seized alive, I sold.<br/>But now, of all the Trojans whom the Gods<br/>Deliver to me, none shall death escape,<br/>'Specially of the house of Priam, none.<br/>Die therefore, even thou, my friend! What mean<br/>Thy tears unreasonably shed and vain?<br/>Died not Patroclus. braver far than thou?<br/>And look on meâ€”see'st not to what a height<br/>My stature towers, and what a bulk I boast?<br/>A King begat me, and a Goddess bore.<br/>What then! A death by violence awaits<br/>Me also, and at morn, or eve, or noon,<br/>I perish, whensoe'er the destined spear<br/>Shall reach me, or the arrow from the nerve.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/>
