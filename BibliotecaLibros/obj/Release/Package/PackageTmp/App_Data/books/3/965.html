&#160;<br/><br/>Fly'st thou, Apollo! and to Neptune yield'st<br/>An unearn'd victory, the prize of fame<br/>Resigning patient and with no dispute?<br/>Fool! wherefore bearest thou the bow in vain?<br/>Ah, let me never in my father's courts<br/>Hear thee among the immortals vaunting more<br/>That thou wouldst Neptune's self confront in arms.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>So she, to whom Apollo nought replied.<br/>But thus the consort of the Thunderer, fired<br/>With wrath, reproved the Archeress of heaven.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>How hast thou dared, impudent, to oppose<br/>My will? Bow-practised as thou art, the task<br/>To match my force were difficult to thee.<br/>
