Henceforth thou art not worthy to be deem'd<br/>Son of Oenides, Tydeus famed in arms.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>To whom thus valiant Diomede replied.<br/>I know thee well, oh Goddess sprung from Jove!<br/>And therefore willing shall, and plain, reply.<br/>Me neither weariness nor heartless fear<br/>Restrains, but thine injunctions which impress<br/>My memory, still, that I should fear to oppose<br/>The blessed Gods in fight, Venus except,<br/>Whom in the battle found thou badest me pierce<br/>With unrelenting spear; therefore myself<br/>Retiring hither, I have hither call'd<br/>The other Argives also, for I know<br/>That Mars, himself in arms, controls the war.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Him answer'd then the Goddess azure-eyed.<br/>
