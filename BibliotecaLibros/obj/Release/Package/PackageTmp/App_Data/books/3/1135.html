So spake she weeping, whom her maidens all<br/>With sighs accompanied, and her complaint<br/>Mingled with sobs Hecuba next began.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Ah Hector! dearest to thy mother's heart<br/>Of all her sons, much must the Gods have loved<br/>Thee living, whom, though dead, they thus preserve.<br/>What son soever of our house beside<br/>Achilles took, over the barren deep<br/>To Samos, Imbrus, or to Lemnos girt<br/>With rocks inhospitable, him he sold;<br/>But thee, by his dread spear of life deprived,<br/>He dragg'd and dragg'd around Patroclus' tomb,<br/>As if to raise again his friend to life<br/>Whom thou hadst vanquish'd; yet he raised him not.<br/>But as for thee, thou liest here with dew<br/>Besprinkled, fresh as a young plant,&#160;and more<br/>Resemblest some fair youth by gentle shafts<br/>Of Ph≈ìbus pierced, than one in battle slain.<br/>
