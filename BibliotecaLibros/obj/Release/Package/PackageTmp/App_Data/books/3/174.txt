Of the grey deep, that ye may trial make
Of Jove, if he will prove, himself, your shield?

Thus, in discharge of his high office, pass'd
Atrides through the ranks, and now arrived
Where, hardy Chief! Idomeneus in front
Of his bold Cretans stood, stout as a boar
The van he occupied, while in the rear
Meriones harangued the most remote.
Them so prepared the King of men beheld
With joyful heart, and thus in courteous terms
Instant the brave Idomeneus address'd.

&#160;

Thee fighting, feasting, howsoe'er employed,
I most respect, Idomeneus, of all
The well-horsed Dan√§i; for when the Chiefs
Of Argos, banqueting, their beakers charge
