His eager speech thus to his mother turn'd.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>The God, my mother! hath bestow'd in truth<br/>Such armor on me as demanded skill<br/>Like his, surpassing far all power of man.<br/>Now, therefore, I will arm. But anxious fears<br/>Trouble me, lest intrusive flies, meantime,<br/>Breed worms within the spear-inflicted wounds<br/>Of Men≈ìtiades, and fill with taint<br/>Of putrefaction his whole breathless form.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>But him the silver-footed Goddess fair<br/>Thus answer'd. Oh, my son! chase from thy mind<br/>All such concern. I will, myself, essay<br/>To drive the noisome swarms which on the slain<br/>In battle feed voracious. Should he lie<br/>The year complete, his flesh shall yet be found<br/>
