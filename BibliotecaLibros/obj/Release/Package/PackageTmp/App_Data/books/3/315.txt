He, conscious, with heroic joy the lot
Cast at his foot, and thus exclaim'd aloud.

&#160;

My friends! the lot is mine,&#160;and my own heart
Rejoices also; for I nothing doubt
That noble Hector shall be foil'd by me.
But while I put mine armor on, pray all
In silence to the King Saturnian Jove,
Lest, while ye pray, the Trojans overhear.
Or pray aloud, for whom have we to dread?
No man shall my firm standing by his strength
Unsettle, or for ignorance of mine
Me vanquish, who, I hope, brought forth and train'd
In Salamis, have, now, not much to learn.

&#160;

He ended. They with heaven-directed eyes
The King in prayer address'd, Saturnian Jove.
