<br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Whom Agamemnon answer'd, King of men.<br/>Ah Nestor! if beneath our very sterns<br/>The battle rage, if neither trench nor wall<br/>Constructed with such labor, and supposed<br/>Of strength to guard impregnably secure<br/>Our navy and ourselves, avail us aught,<br/>It is because almighty Jove hath will'd<br/>That the Achaian host should perish here<br/>Inglorious, from their country far remote.<br/>When he vouchsafed assistance to the Greeks,<br/>I knew it well; and now, not less I know<br/>That high as the immortal Gods he lifts<br/>Our foes to glory, and depresses us.<br/>Haste therefore all, and act as I advise.<br/>Our shipsâ€”all those that nearest skirt the Deep,<br/>Launch we into the sacred flood, and moor<br/>With anchors safely, till o'ershadowing night<br/>(If night itself may save us) shall arrive.<br/>
