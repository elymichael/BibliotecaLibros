No tower'd city is at hand,<br/>None that presents us with a safe retreat<br/>While others occupy our station here,<br/>But from the shores of Argos far remote<br/>Our camp is, where the Trojans arm'd complete<br/>Swarm on the plain, and Ocean shuts us in.<br/>Our hands must therefore save us, not our heels<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>He said, and furious with his spear again<br/>
