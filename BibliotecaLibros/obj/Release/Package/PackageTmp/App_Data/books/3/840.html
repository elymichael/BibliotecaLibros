Hath given me glory now, and to inclose<br/>The Grecians in their fleet hemm'd by the sea,<br/>Fool! taint not with such talk the public mind.<br/>For not a Trojan here will thy advice<br/>Follow, or shall; it hath not my consent.<br/>But thus I counsel. Let us, band by band,<br/>Throughout the host take supper, and let each,<br/>Guarded against nocturnal danger, watch.<br/>And if a Trojan here be rack'd in mind<br/>Lest his possessions perish, let him cast<br/>His golden heaps into the public maw,<br/>Far better so consumed than by the Greeks.<br/>Then, with the morrow's dawn, all fair array'd<br/>In battle, we will give them at their fleet<br/>Sharp onset, and if Peleus' noble son<br/>Have risen indeed to conflict for the ships,<br/>The worse for him. I shall not for his sake<br/>Avoid the deep-toned battle, but will firm<br/>Oppose his utmost. Either he shall gain<br/>Or I, great glory. Mars his favors deals<br/>Impartial, and the slayer oft is slain.<br/>
