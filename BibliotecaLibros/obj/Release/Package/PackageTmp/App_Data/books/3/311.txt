Jove! Pallas! Phœbus! Oh that I were young
As when the Pylians in fierce fight engaged
The Arcadians spear-expert, beside the stream
Of rapid Celadon! Beneath the walls
We fought of Pheia, where the Jardan rolls.
There Ereuthalion, Chief of godlike form,
Stood forth before his van, and with loud voice
Defied the Pylians. Arm'd he was in steel
By royal Areïthous whilom worn;
Brave Areïthous, Corynetes&#160;named
By every tongue; for that in bow and spear
Nought trusted he, but with an iron mace
The close-embattled phalanx shatter'd wide.

Lycurgus vanquish'd, in a narrow pass,
Where him his iron whirl-bat&#160;nought avail'd.
Lycurgus stealing on him, with his lance
Transpierced and fix'd him to the soil supine.

He stripp'd, which after, in the embattled field
Lycurgus wore himself, but, growing old,
