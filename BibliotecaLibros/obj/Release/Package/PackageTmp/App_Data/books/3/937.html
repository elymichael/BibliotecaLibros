Ah, illustrious Chief!<br/>Reject not with disdain a suppliant's prayer.<br/>I am thy guest also, who at thy own board<br/>Have eaten bread, and did partake the gift<br/>Of Ceres with thee on the very day<br/>When thou didst send me in yon field surprised<br/>For sale to sacred Lemnos, far remote,<br/>And for my price receiv'dst a hundred beeves.<br/>Loose me, and I will yield thee now that sum<br/>Thrice told. Alas! this morn is but the twelfth<br/>Since, after numerous hardships, I arrived<br/>Once more in Troy, and now my ruthless lot<br/>Hath given me into thy hands again.<br/>Jove cannot less than hate me, who hath twice<br/>Made me thy prisoner, and my doom was death,<br/>
