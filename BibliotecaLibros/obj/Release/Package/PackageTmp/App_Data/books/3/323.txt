Presented bright-emboss'd, and a bright belt
Purpureal&#160;took from Ajax in return.

And one the Trojans; they when him they saw
From the unconquer'd hands return'd alive

And to the city led him, double joy
Conceiving all at his unhoped escape.

In honor of the conqueror slew an ox
Of the fifth year to Jove omnipotent.

The whole abroad, then, scoring deep the flesh,
They pierced it with the spits, and from the spits
(Once roasted well) withdrew it all again.
Their labor thus accomplish'd, and the board
