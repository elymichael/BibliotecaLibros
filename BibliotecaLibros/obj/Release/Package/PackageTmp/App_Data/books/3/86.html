So prayed he, but with none effect, The God<br/>Received his offering, but to double toil<br/>Doom'd them, and sorrow more than all the past.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>They then, the triturated barley grain<br/>First duly sprinkling, the sharp steel infix'd<br/>Deep in the victim's neck reversed, then stripp'd<br/>The carcase, and divided at their joint<br/>The thighs, which in the double caul involved<br/>They spread with slices crude, and burn'd with fire<br/>Ascending fierce from billets sere and dry.<br/>The spitted entrails next they o'er the coals<br/>Suspended held. The thighs with fire consumed,<br/>They gave to each his portion of the maw,<br/>Then slash'd the remnant, pierced it with the spits,<br/>And managing with culinary skill<br/>The roast, withdrew it from the spits again.<br/>Thus, all their task accomplished, and the board<br/>Set forth, they feasted, and were all sufficed.<br/>
