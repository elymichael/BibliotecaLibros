<br/>So they, among the ships, conferring sat<br/>On various themes, the Goddess and her son;<br/>Meantime Saturnian Jove commanded down<br/>His swift ambassadress to sacred Troy.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Hence, rapid Iris! leave the Olympian heights.<br/>And, finding noble Priam, bid him haste<br/>Into Achaia's fleet, bearing such gifts<br/>As may assuage Achilles, and prevail<br/>To liberate the body of his son.<br/>Alone, he must; no Trojan of them all<br/>May company the senior thither, save<br/>An ancient herald to direct his mules<br/>And his wheel'd litter, and to bring the dead<br/>Back into Ilium, whom Achilles slew.<br/>Let neither fear of death nor other fear<br/>Trouble him aught, so safe a guard and sure<br/>We give him; Mercury shall be his guide<br/>
