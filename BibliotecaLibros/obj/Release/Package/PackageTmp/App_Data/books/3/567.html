Stood not, nor to Achaian prowess dared<br/>The hindrance of a moment's strife oppose.<br/>But now, Troy left afar, even at our ships<br/>They give us battle, through our leader's fault<br/>And through the people's negligence, who fill'd<br/>With fierce displeasure against<br/>him<br/>, prefer<br/>Death at their ships, to war in their defence.<br/>But if the son of Atreus, our supreme,<br/>If Agamemnon, have indeed transgress'd<br/>Past all excuse, dishonoring the swift<br/>Achilles, ye at least the fight decline<br/>Blame-worthy, and with no sufficient plea.<br/>But heal we speedily the breach; brave minds<br/>Easily coalesce. It is not well<br/>That thus your fury slumbers, for the host<br/>Hath none illustrious as yourselves in arms.<br/>I can excuse the timid if he shrink,<br/>But am incensed at<br/>you<br/>
