A noble prize; a beauteous maiden versed<br/>In arts domestic, with a tripod ear'd,<br/>Of twenty and two measures. These he made<br/>The conqueror's meed. The second should a mare<br/>Obtain, unbroken yet, six years her age,<br/>Pregnant, and bearing in her womb a mule.<br/>A caldron of four measures, never smirch'd<br/>By smoke or flame, but fresh as from the forge<br/>The third awaited; to the fourth he gave<br/>Two golden talents, and, unsullied yet<br/>By use, a twin-ear'd phial&#160;to the fifth.<br/>He stood erect, and to the Greeks he cried.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Atrides, and ye chiefs of all the host!<br/>These prizes, in the circus placed, attend<br/>The charioteers. Held we the present games<br/>In honor of some other Grecian dead,<br/>I would myself bear hence the foremost prize;<br/>For ye are all witnesses well-inform'd<br/>
