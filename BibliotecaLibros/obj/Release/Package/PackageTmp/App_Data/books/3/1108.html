The Argicide. Oh ancient and revered!<br/>Thou hast well spoken all. Yet this declare,<br/>And with sincerity; bear'st thou away<br/>Into some foreign country, for the sake<br/>Of safer custody, this precious charge?<br/>Or, urged by fear, forsake ye all alike<br/>Troy's sacred towers! since he whom thou hast lost,<br/>Thy noble son, was of excelling worth<br/>In arms, and nought inferior to the Greeks.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Then thus the godlike Priam, hoary King.<br/>But tell me first who<br/>Thou<br/>art, and from whom<br/>Descended, loveliest youth! who hast the fate<br/>So well of my unhappy son rehearsed?<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>
