Promiscuous flung. Sarpedon, when he saw<br/>Such havoc made of his uncinctured&#160;friends<br/>By Men≈ìtiades, with sharp rebuke<br/>His band of godlike Lycians loud address'd.<br/><br/>Shame on you, Lycians! whither would ye fly?<br/>Now are ye swift indeed! I will oppose<br/>Myself this conqueror, that I may learn<br/>Who thus afflicts the Trojan host, of life<br/>Bereaving numerous of their warriors bold.<br/><br/>He said, and with his arms leap'd to the ground.<br/>On the other side, Patroclus at that sight<br/>Sprang from his chariot. As two vultures clash<br/>Bow-beak'd, crook-talon'd, on some lofty rock<br/>Clamoring both, so they together rush'd<br/>With clamors loud; whom when the son observed<br/>Of wily Saturn, with compassion moved<br/>His sister and his spouse he thus bespake.<br/><br/>Alas, he falls! my most beloved of men<br/>
