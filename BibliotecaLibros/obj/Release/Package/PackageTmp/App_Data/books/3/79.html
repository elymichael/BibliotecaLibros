Her also next,<br/>Hovering and clamoring, he by the wing<br/>Within his spiry folds drew, and devoured.<br/>All eaten thus, the nestlings and the dam,<br/>The God who sent him, signalized him too,<br/>For him Saturnian Jove transform'd to stone.<br/>We wondering stood, to see that strange portent<br/>Intrude itself into our holy rites,<br/>When Calchas, instant, thus the sign explain'd.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Why stand ye, Greeks, astonish'd? Ye behold<br/>A prodigy by Jove himself produced,<br/>An omen, whose accomplishment indeed<br/>Is distant, but whose fame shall never die.<br/>E'en as this serpent in your sight devour'd<br/>Eight youngling sparrows, with their dam, the ninth,<br/>So we nine years must war on yonder plain,<br/>And in the tenth, wide-bulwark'd Troy is ours.<br/><br/>
