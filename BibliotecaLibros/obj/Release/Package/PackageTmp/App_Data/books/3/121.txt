ARGUMENT OF THE THIRD BOOK.

The armies meet. Paris throws out a challenge to the Grecian
Princes. Menelaus accepts it. The terms of the combat are adjusted
solemnly by Agamemnon on the part of Greece, and by Priam on the
part of Troy. The combat ensues, in which Paris is vanquished, whom
yet Venus rescues. Agamemnon demands from the Trojans a performance
of the covenant.

Now marshall'd all beneath their several chiefs,
With deafening shouts, and with the clang of arms,
The host of Troy advanced. Such clang is heard
Along the skies, when from incessant showers
Escaping, and from winter's cold, the cranes
Take wing, and over Ocean speed away;
Wo to the land of dwarfs! prepared they fly
