Seated of Gargarus, and wrapt around<br/>With fragrant clouds, they found Saturnian Jove<br/>The Thunderer, and in his presence stood.<br/>He, nought displeased that they his high command<br/>Had with such readiness obey'd, his speech<br/>To Iris, first, in accents wing'd address'd<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Swift Iris, hasteâ€”to royal Neptune bear<br/>My charge entire; falsify not the word.<br/>Bid him, relinquishing the fight, withdraw<br/>Either to heaven, or to the boundless Deep.<br/>But should he disobedient prove, and scorn<br/>My message, let him, next, consider well<br/>How he will bear, powerful as he is,<br/>My coming. Me I boast superior far<br/>In force, and elder-born; yet deems he slight<br/>The danger of comparison with me,<br/>Who am the terror of all heaven beside.<br/><br/>
