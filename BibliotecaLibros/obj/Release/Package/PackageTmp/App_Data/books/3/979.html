Loud wail'd the hoary King; with lifted hands<br/>His head he smote, and, uttering doleful cries<br/>Of supplication, sued to his own son.<br/>He, fixt before the gate, desirous stood<br/>Of combat with Achilles, when his sire<br/>With arms outstretch'd toward him, thus began.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>My Hector! wait not, oh my son! the approach<br/>Of this dread Chief, alone, lest premature<br/>Thou die, this moment by Achilles slain,<br/>For he is strongest far. Oh that the Gods<br/>Him loved as I! then, soon should vultures rend<br/>And dogs his carcase, and my grief should cease.<br/>He hath unchilded me of many a son,<br/>All valiant youths, whom he hath slain or sold<br/>To distant isles, and even now, I miss<br/>Two sons, whom since the shutting of the gates<br/>I find not, Polydorus and Lycaon,<br/>My children by Laoth√∂e the fair.<br/>
