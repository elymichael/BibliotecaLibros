<br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Then Ph≈ìbus from pursuit of Ilium's host<br/>By art averted Peleus' son; the form<br/>Assuming of Agenor, swift he fled<br/>Before him, and Achilles swift pursued.<br/>While him Apollo thus lured to the chase<br/>Wide o'er the fruitful plain, inclining still<br/>Toward Scamander's dizzy stream his course<br/>Nor flying far before, but with false hope<br/>Always beguiling him, the scatter'd host<br/>Meantime, in joyful throngs, regain'd the town.<br/>They fill'd and shut it fast, nor dared to wait<br/>Each other in the field, or to inquire<br/>Who lived and who had fallen, but all, whom flight<br/>Had rescued, like a flood pour'd into Troy.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
