Fools! they shall find this wall which they have raised<br/>Too weak to check my course, a feeble guard<br/>Contemptible; such also is the trench;<br/>My steeds shall slight it with an easy leap.<br/>But when ye see me in their fleet arrived,<br/>Remember fire. Then bring me flaming brands<br/>That I may burn their galleys and themselves<br/>Slaughter beside them, struggling in the smoke.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>He spake, and thus encouraged next his steeds.<br/>Xanthus! Podargus! and ye generous pair<br/>Æthon and glossy Lampus! now requite<br/>Mine, and the bounty of Andromache,<br/>Far-famed Eëtion's daughter; she your bowl<br/>With corn fresh-flavor'd and with wine full oft<br/>Hath mingled, your refreshment seeking first<br/>Ere mine, who have a youthful husband's claim.<br/>Now follow! now be swift; that we may seize<br/>The shield of Nestor, bruited to the skies<br/>
