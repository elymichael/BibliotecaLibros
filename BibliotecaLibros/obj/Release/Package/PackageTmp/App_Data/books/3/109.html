&#160;<br/><br/>The men of Ormenus, and from beside<br/>The fountain Hypereia, from the tops<br/>Of chalky Titan, and Asteria's band;<br/>Them ruled Eurypylus, Evæmon's son<br/>Illustrious, whom twice twenty ships obeyed.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Orthe, Gyrtone, Oloösson white,<br/>Argissa and Helone; they their youth<br/>Gave to control of Polypœtes, son<br/>Undaunted of Pirithoüs, son of Jove.<br/>Him, to Pirithoüs, (on the self-same day<br/>When he the Centaurs punish'd and pursued<br/>Sheer to Æthicæ driven from Pelion's heights<br/>The shaggy race) Hippodamia bore.<br/>Nor he alone them led. With him was join'd<br/>Leonteus dauntless warrior, from the bold<br/>Coronus sprung, who Cæneus call'd his sire.<br/>
