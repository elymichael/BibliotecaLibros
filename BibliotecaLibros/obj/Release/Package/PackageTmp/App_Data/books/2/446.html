<br/>"Oh, that's all nonsense about Troy, a trivial matter. I<br/>consider this an unimportant question," said Kolya with haughty<br/>humility. He had by now completely recovered his dignity, though he<br/>was still a little uneasy. He felt that he was greatly excited and<br/>that he had talked about the goose, for instance, with too little<br/>reserve, while Alyosha had looked serious and had not said a word<br/>all the time. And the vain boy began by degrees to have a rankling<br/>fear that Alyosha was silent because he despised him, and thought<br/>he was showing off before him. If he dared to think anything like<br/>that, Kolya would-<br/><br/>"I regard the question as quite a trivial one," he rapped out<br/>again, proudly.<br/><br/>"And I know who founded Troy," a boy, who had not spoken before,<br/>said suddenly, to the surprise of everyone. He was silent and<br/>seemed to be shy. He was a pretty boy of about eleven, called<br/>Kartashov. He was sitting near the door. Kolya looked at him with<br/>dignified amazement.<br/><br/>The fact was that the identity of the founders of Troy had<br/>become a secret for the whole school, a secret which could only be<br/>discovered by reading Smaragdov, and no one had Smaragdov but<br/>Kolya. One day, when Kolya's back was turned, Kartashov hastily<br/>opened Smaragdov, which lay among Kolya's books, and immediately<br/>lighted on the passage relating to the foundation of Troy. This was<br/>a good time ago, but he felt uneasy and could not bring himself to<br/>announce publicly that he too knew who had founded Troy, afraid of<br/>what might happen and of Krassotkin's somehow putting him to shame<br/>over it. But now he couldn't resist saying it. For weeks he had<br/>been longing to.<br/><br/>"Well, who did found it?" Kolya, turning to him with haughty<br/>superciliousness. He saw from his face that he really did know and<br/>at once made up his mind how to take it. There was so to speak, a<br/>discordant note in the general harmony.<br/><br/>"Troy was founded by Teucer, Dardanus, Ilius and Tros," the boy<br/>rapped out at once, and in the same instant he blushed, blushed so,<br/>that it was painful to look at him. But the boys stared at him,<br/>stared at him for a whole minute, and then all the staring eyes<br/>turned at once and were fastened upon Kolya, who was still scanning<br/>the audacious boy with disdainful composure.<br/><br/>"In what sense did they found it?" he deigned to comment at<br/>last. "And what is meant by founding a city or a state? What do<br/>they do? Did they go and each lay a brick, do you suppose?"<br/><br/>There was laughter. The offending boy turned from pink to<br/>crimson. He was silent and on the point of tears. Kolya held him so<br/>for a minute.<br/><br/>"Before you talk of a historical event like the foundation of a<br/>nationality, you must first understand what you mean by it," he<br/>admonished him in stern, incisive tones. "But I attach no<br/>consequence to these old wives' tales and I don't think much of<br/>universal history in general," he added carelessly, addressing the<br/>company generally.<br/><br/>"Universal history?" the captain inquired, looking almost<br/>scared.<br/><br/>
