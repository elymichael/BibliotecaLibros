<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>6<br/>A<br/>Laceration in the Cottage<br/><br/><br/>HE certainly was really grieved in a way he had seldom been<br/>before. He had rushed in like a fool, and meddled in what? In a<br/>love-affair. "But what do I know about it? What can I tell about<br/>such things?" he repeated to himself for the hundredth time,<br/>flushing crimson. "Oh, being ashamed would be nothing; shame is<br/>only the punishment I deserve. The trouble is I shall certainly<br/>have caused more unhappinessâ€¦ . And Father Zossima sent me to<br/>reconcile and bring them together. Is this the way to bring them<br/>together?" Then he suddenly remembered how he had tried to join<br/>their hands, and he felt fearfully ashamed again. "Though I acted<br/>quite sincerely, I must be more sensible in the future," he<br/>concluded suddenly, and did not even smile at his conclusion.<br/><br/>Katerina Ivanovna's commission took him to Lake Street, and his<br/>brother Dmitri lived close by, in a turning out of Lake Street.<br/>Alyosha decided to go to him in any case before going to the<br/>captain, though he had a presentiment that he would not find his<br/>brother. He suspected that he would intentionally keep out of his<br/>way now, but he must find him anyhow. Time was passing: the thought<br/>of his dying elder had not left Alyosha for one minute from the<br/>time he set off from the monastery.<br/><br/>There was one point which interested him particularly about<br/>Katerina Ivanovna's commission; when she had mentioned the<br/>captain's son, the little schoolboy who had run beside his father<br/>crying, the idea had at once struck Alyosha that this must be the<br/>schoolboy who had bitten his finger when he, Alyosha, asked him<br/>what he had done to hurt him. Now Alyosha felt practically certain<br/>of this, though he could not have said why. Thinking of another<br/>subject was a relief, and he resolved to think no more about the<br/>"mischief" he had done, and not to torture himself with remorse,<br/>but to do what he had to do, let come what would. At that thought<br/>he was completely comforted. Turning to the street where Dmitri<br/>lodged, he felt hungry, and taking out of his pocket the roll he<br/>had brought from his father's, he ate it. It made him feel<br/>stronger.<br/><br/>Dmitri was not at home. The people of the house, an old<br/>cabinet-maker, his son, and his old wife, looked with positive<br/>suspicion at Alyosha. "He hasn't slept here for the last three<br/>nights. Maybe he has gone away," the old man said in answer to<br/>Alyosha's persistent inquiries. Alyosha saw that he was answering<br/>in accordance with instructions. When he asked whether he were not<br/>at Grushenka's or in hiding at Foma's (Alyosha spoke so freely on<br/>purpose), all three looked at him in alarm. "They are fond of him,<br/>they are doing their best for him," thought Alyosha. "That's<br/>good."<br/><br/>At last he found the house in Lake Street. It was a decrepit<br/>little house, sunk on one side, with three windows looking into the<br/>street, and with a muddy yard, in the middle of which stood a<br/>solitary cow. He crossed the yard and found the door opening into<br/>the passage. On the left of the passage lived the old woman of the<br/>house with her old daughter. Both seemed to be deaf. In answer to<br/>his repeated inquiry for the captain, one of them at last<br/>understood that he was asking for their lodgers, and pointed to a<br/>door across the passage. The captain's lodging turned out to be a<br/>simple cottage room. Alyosha had his hand on the iron latch to open<br/>the door, when he was struck by the strange hush within. Yet he<br/>knew from Katerina Ivanovna's words that the man had a family.<br/>"Either they are all asleep or perhaps they have heard me coming<br/>and are waiting for me to open the door. I'd better knock first,"<br/>and he knocked. An answer came, but not at once, after an interval<br/>of perhaps ten seconds.<br/><br/>"Who's there?" shouted someone in a loud and very angry<br/>voice.<br/><br/>Then Alyosha opened the door and crossed the threshold. He found<br/>himself in a regular peasant's room. Though it was large, it was<br/>cumbered up with domestic belongings of all sorts, and there were<br/>several people in it. On the left was a large Russian stove. From<br/>the stove to the window on the left was a string running across the<br/>room, and on it there were rags hanging. There was a bedstead<br/>against the wall on each side, right and left, covered with knitted<br/>quilts. On the one on the left was a pyramid of four print-covered<br/>pillows, each smaller than the one beneath. On the other there was<br/>only one very small pillow. The opposite corner was screened off by<br/>a curtain or a sheet hung on a string. Behind this curtain could be<br/>seen a bed made up on a bench and a chair. The rough square table<br/>of plain wood had been moved into the middle window. The three<br/>windows, which consisted each of four tiny greenish mildewy panes,<br/>gave little light, and were close shut, so that the room was not<br/>very light and rather stuffy. On the table was a frying pan with<br/>the remains of some fried eggs, a half-eaten piece of bread, and a<br/>small bottle with a few drops of vodka.<br/>
