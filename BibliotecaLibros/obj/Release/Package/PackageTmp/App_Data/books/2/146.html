he added,<br/>with a forced smile, showing, however, that he could read Schiller,<br/>and read him till he knew him by heart- which Alyosha would never<br/>have believed. He went out of the room without saying good-bye even<br/>to his hostess, Madame Hohlakov. Alyosha clasped his hands. "Ivan!"<br/>he cried desperately after him. "Come back, Ivan! No, nothing will<br/>induce him to come back now!" he cried again, regretfully realising<br/>it; "but it's my fault, my fault. I began it! Ivan spoke angrily,<br/>wrongly. Unjustly and angrily. He must come back here, come back,"<br/>Alyosha kept exclaiming frantically. Katerina Ivanovna went<br/>suddenly into the next room. "You have done no harm. You behaved<br/>beautifully, like an angel," Madame Hohlakov whispered rapidly and<br/>ecstatically to Alyosha. "I will do my utmost to prevent Ivan<br/>Fyodorovitch from going." Her face beamed with delight, to the<br/>great distress of Alyosha, but Katerina Ivanovna suddenly returned.<br/>She had two hundred-rouble notes in her hand. "I have a great<br/>favour to ask of you, Alexey Fyodorovitch," she began, addressing<br/>Alyosha with an apparently calm and even voice, as though nothing<br/>had happened. "A week- yes, I think it was a week ago- Dmitri<br/>Fyodorovitch was guilty of a hasty and unjust action- a very ugly<br/>action. There is a low tavern here, and in it he met that<br/>discharged officer, that captain, whom your father used to employ<br/>in some business. Dmitri Fyodorovitch somehow lost his temper with<br/>this captain, seized him by the beard and dragged him out into the<br/>street and for some distance along it, in that insulting fashion.<br/>And I am told that his son, a boy, quite a child, who is at the<br/>school here, saw it and ran beside them crying and begging for his<br/>father, appealing to everyone to defend him, while everyone<br/>laughed. You must forgive me, Alexey Fyodorovitch, I cannot think<br/>without indignation of that disgraceful action of his… one of those<br/>actions of which only Dmitri Fyodorovitch would be capable in his<br/>anger… and in his passions! I can't describe it even… . I can't<br/>find my words. I've made inquiries about his victim, and find he is<br/>quite a poor man. His name is Snegiryov. He did something wrong in<br/>the army and was discharged. I can't tell you what. And now he has<br/>sunk into terrible destitution, with his family- an unhappy family<br/>of sick children, and, I believe, an insane wife. He has been<br/>living here a long time; he used to work as a copying clerk, but<br/>now he is getting nothing. I thought if you… that is I thought… I<br/>don't know. I am so confused. You see, I wanted to ask you, my dear<br/>Alexey Fyodorovitch, to go to him, to find some excuse to go to<br/>them- I mean to that captain- oh, goodness, how badly I explain<br/>it!- and delicately, carefully, as only you know how to" (Alyosha<br/>blushed), "manage to give him this assistance, these two hundred<br/>roubles. He will be sure to take it… . I mean, persuade him to take<br/>it… . Or, rather, what do I mean? You see it's not by way of<br/>compensation to prevent him from taking proceedings (for I believe<br/>he meant to), but simply a token of sympathy, of a desire to assist<br/>him from me, Dmitri Fyodorovitch's betrothed, not from himself… .<br/>But you know… . I would go myself, but you'll know how to do it<br/>ever so much better. He lives in Lake Street in the house of a<br/>woman called Kalmikov… . For God's sake, Alexey Fyodorovitch, do it<br/>for me, and now… now I am rather… tired… Good-bye!" She turned and<br/>disappeared behind the portiere so quickly that Alyosha had not<br/>time to utter a word, though he wanted to speak. He longed to beg<br/>her pardon, to blame himself, to say something, for his heart was<br/>full and he could not bear to go out of the room without it. But<br/>Madame Hohlakov took him by the hand and drew him along with her.<br/>In the hall she stopped him again as before. "She is proud, she is<br/>struggling with herself; but kind, charming, generous, "she<br/>exclaimed, in a half-whisper. "Oh, how I love her, especially<br/>sometimes, and how glad I am again of everything! Dear Alexey<br/>Fyodorovitch, you didn't know, but I must tell you, that we all,<br/>all- both her aunts, I and all of us, Lise, even- have been hoping<br/>and praying for nothing for the last month but that she may give up<br/>your favourite Dmitri, who takes no notice of her and does not care<br/>for her, and may marry Ivan Fyodorovitch- such an excellent and<br/>cultivated young man, who loves her more than anything in the<br/>world. We are in a regular plot to bring it about, and I am even<br/>staying on here perhaps on that account." "But she has been crying-<br/>she has been wounded again," cried Alyosha. "Never trust a woman's<br/>tears, Alexey Fyodorovitch. I am never for the women in such cases.<br/>I am always on the side of the men." "Mamma, you are spoiling him,"<br/>Lise's little voice cried from behind the door. "No, it was all my<br/>fault. I am horribly to blame," Alyosha repeated unconsoled, hiding<br/>his face in his hands in an agony of remorse for his indiscretion.<br/>"Quite the contrary; you behaved like an angel, like an angel. I am<br/>ready to say so a thousand times over." "Mamma, how has he behaved<br/>like an angel?" Lise's voice was heard again. "I somehow fancied<br/>all at once," Alyosha went on as though he had not heard Lise,<br/>"that she loved Ivan, and so I said that stupid thing… . What will<br/>happen now?" "To whom, to whom?" cried Lise. "Mamma, you really<br/>want to be the death of me. I ask you and you don't answer." At the<br/>moment the maid ran in. "Katerina Ivanovna is ill… . She is crying,<br/>struggling… hysterics." "What is the matter?" cried Lise, in a tone<br/>of real anxiety. "Mamma, I shall be having hysterics, and not she!"<br/>"Lise, for mercy's sake, don't scream, don't persecute me. At your<br/>age one can't know everything that grown-up people know. I'll come<br/>and tell you everything you ought to know. Oh, mercy on us! I am<br/>coming, I am coming… . Hysterics is a good sign, Alexey<br/>Fyodorovitch; it's an excellent thing that she is hysterical.<br/>That's just as it ought to be. In such cases I am always against<br/>the woman, against all these feminine tears and hysterics. Run and<br/>say, Yulia, that I'll fly to her. As for Ivan Fyodorovitch's going<br/>away like that, it's her own fault. But he won't go away. Lise, for<br/>mercy's sake, don't scream! Oh, yes; you are not screaming. It's I<br/>am screaming. Forgive your mamma; but I am delighted, delighted,<br/>delighted! Did you notice, Alexey Fyodorovitch, how young, how<br/>young Ivan Fyodorovitch was just now when he went out, when he said<br/>all that and went out? I thought he was so learned, such a savant,<br/>and all of a sudden he behaved so warmly, openly, and youthfully,<br/>with such youthful inexperience, and it was all so fine, like you…<br/>. And the way he repeated that German verse, it was just like you!<br/>But I must fly, I must fly! Alexey Fyodorovitch, make haste to<br/>carry out her commission, and then make haste back. Lise, do you<br/>want anything now? For mercy's sake, don't keep Alexey Fyodorovitch<br/>a minute. He will come back to you at once." Madame Hohlakov at<br/>last ran off. Before leaving, Alyosha would have opened the door to<br/>see Lise. "On no account," cried Lise. "On no account now. Speak<br/>through the door. How have you come to be an angel? That's the only<br/>thing I want to know." "For an awful piece of stupidity, Lise!<br/>Goodbye!" "Don't dare to go away like that!" Lise was beginning.<br/>"Lise, I have a real sorrow! I'll be back directly, but I have a<br/>great, great sorrow! And he ran out of the room.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
