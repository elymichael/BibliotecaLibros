<br/>He almost fell back in his place: his voice broke: he could<br/>hardly articulate the last phrase. Then the judges proceeded to put<br/>the questions and began to ask both sides to formulate their<br/>conclusions. But I will not describe the details. At last the jury<br/>rose to retire for consultation. The President was very tired, and<br/>so his last charge to the jury was rather feeble. "Be impartial,<br/>don't be influenced by the eloquence of the defence, but yet weigh<br/>the arguments. Remember that there is a great responsibility laid<br/>upon you," and so on and so on.<br/><br/>The jury withdrew and the court adjourned. People could get up,<br/>move about, exchange their accumulated impressions, refresh<br/>themselves at the buffet. It was very late, almost one o'clock in<br/>the night, but nobody went away: the strain was so great that no<br/>one could think of repose. All waited with sinking hearts; though<br/>that is, perhaps, too much to say, for the ladies were only in a<br/>state of hysterical impatience and their hearts were untroubled. An<br/>acquittal, they thought, was inevitable. They all prepared<br/>themselves for a dramatic moment of general enthusiasm. I must own<br/>there were many among the men, too, who were convinced that an<br/>acquittal was inevitable. Some were pleased, others frowned, while<br/>some were simply dejected, not wanting him to be acquitted.<br/>Fetyukovitch himself was confident of his success. He was<br/>surrounded by people congratulating him and fawning upon him.<br/><br/>"There are," he said to one group, as I was told afterwards,<br/>"there are invisible threads binding the counsel for the defence<br/>with the jury. One feels during one's speech if they are being<br/>formed. I was aware of them. They exist. Our cause is won. Set your<br/>mind at rest."<br/><br/>"What will our peasants say now?" said one stout, cross-looking,<br/>pock-marked gentleman, a landowner of the neighbourhood,<br/>approaching a group of gentlemen engaged in conversation.<br/><br/>"But they are not all peasants. There are four government clerks<br/>among them."<br/><br/>"Yes, there are clerks," said a member of the district council,<br/>joining the group.<br/><br/>"And do you know that Nazaryev, the merchant with the medal, a<br/>juryman?"<br/><br/>"What of him?"<br/><br/>"He is a man with brains."<br/><br/>"But he never speaks."<br/><br/>
