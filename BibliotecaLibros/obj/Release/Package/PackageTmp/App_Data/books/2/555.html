<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>6<br/>The Prosecutor's Speech. Sketches of Character<br/><br/><br/>IPPOLIT KIRILLOVITCH began his speech, trembling with<br/>nervousness, with cold sweat on his forehead, feeling hot and cold<br/>all over by turns. He described this himself afterwards. He<br/>regarded this speech as his chef-d'oeuvre, the chef-d'oeuvre of his<br/>whole life, as his swan-song. He died, it is true, nine months<br/>later of rapid consumption, so that he had the right, as it turned<br/>out, to compare himself to a swan singing his last song. He had put<br/>his whole heart and all the brain he had into that speech. And poor<br/>Ippolit Kirillovitch unexpectedly revealed that at least some<br/>feeling for the public welfare and "the eternal question" lay<br/>concealed in him. Where his speech really excelled was in its<br/>sincerity. He genuinely believed in the prisoner's guilt; he was<br/>accusing him not as an official duty only, and in calling for<br/>vengeance he quivered with a genuine passion "for the security of<br/>society." Even the ladies in thee audience, though they remained<br/>hostile to Ippolit Kirillovitch, admitted that he made an<br/>extraordinary impression on them. He began in a breaking voice, but<br/>it soon gained strength and filled the court to the end of his<br/>speech. But as soon as he had finished, he almost fainted.<br/><br/>"Gentlemen of the jury," began the prosecutor, "this case has<br/>made a stir throughout Russia. But what is there to wonder at, what<br/>is there so peculiarly horrifying in it for us? We are so<br/>accustomed to such crimes! That's what's so horrible, that such<br/>dark deeds have ceased to horrify us. What ought to horrify us is<br/>that we are so accustomed to it, and not this or that isolated<br/>crime. What are the causes of our indifference, our lukewarm<br/>attitude to such deeds, to such signs of the times, ominous of an<br/>unenviable future? Is it our cynicism, is it the premature<br/>exhaustion of intellect and imagination in a society that is<br/>sinking into decay, in spite of its youth? Is it that our moral<br/>principles are shattered to their foundations, or is it, perhaps, a<br/>complete lack of such principles among us? I cannot answer such<br/>questions; nevertheless they are disturbing, and every citizen not<br/>only must, but ought to be harassed by them. Our newborn and still<br/>timid press has done good service to the public already, for<br/>without it we should never have heard of the horrors of unbridled<br/>violence and moral degradation which are continually made known by<br/>the press, not merely to those who attend the new jury courts<br/>established in the present reign, but to everyone. And what do we<br/>read almost daily? Of things beside which the present case grows<br/>pale, and seems almost commonplace. But what is most important is<br/>that the majority of our national crimes of violence bear witness<br/>to a widespread evil, now so general among us that it is difficult<br/>to contend against it.<br/><br/>"One day we see a brilliant young officer of high society, at<br/>the very outset of his career, in a cowardly underhand way, without<br/>a pang of conscience, murdering an official who had once been his<br/>benefactor, and the servant girl, to steal his own I O U and what<br/>ready money he could find on him; 'it will come in handy for my<br/>pleasures in the fashionable world and for my career in the<br/>future.' After murdering them, he puts pillows under the head of<br/>each of his victims; he goes away. Next, a young hero 'decorated<br/>for bravery' kills the mother of his chief and benefactor, like a<br/>highwayman, and to urge his companions to join him he asserts that<br/>'she loves him like a son, and so will follow all his directions<br/>and take no precautions.' Granted that he is a monster, yet I dare<br/>not say in these days that he is unique. Another man will not<br/>commit the murder, but will feel and think like him, and is as<br/>dishonourable in soul. In silence, alone with his conscience, he<br/>asks himself perhaps, 'What is honour, and isn't the condemnation<br/>of bloodshed a prejudice?'<br/><br/>"Perhaps people will cry out against me that I am morbid,<br/>hysterical, that it is a monstrous slander, that I am exaggerating.<br/>Let them say so- and heavens! I should be the first to rejoice if<br/>it were so! Oh, don't believe me, think of me as morbid, but<br/>remember my words; if only a tenth, if only a twentieth part of<br/>what I say is true- even so it's awful! Look how our young people<br/>commit suicide, without asking themselves Hamlet's question what<br/>there is beyond, without a sign of such a question, as though all<br/>that relates to the soul and to what awaits us beyond the grave had<br/>long been erased in their minds and buried under the sands. Look at<br/>our vice, at our profligates. Fyodor Pavlovitch, the luckless<br/>victim in the present case, was almost an innocent babe compared<br/>with many of them. And yet we all knew him, 'he lived among<br/>us!'…<br/><br/>"Yes, one day perhaps the leading intellects of Russia and of<br/>Europe will study the psychology of Russian crime, for the subject<br/>is worth it. But this study will come later, at leisure, when all<br/>the tragic topsy-turvydom of to-day is farther behind us, so that<br/>it's possible to examine it with more insight and more impartiality<br/>than I can do. Now we are either horrified or pretend to be<br/>horrified, though we really gloat over the spectacle, and love<br/>strong and eccentric sensations which tickle our cynical, pampered<br/>idleness. Or, like little children, we brush the dreadful ghosts<br/>away and hide our heads in the pillow so as to return to our sports<br/>and merriment as soon as they have vanished. But we must one day<br/>begin life in sober earnest, we must look at ourselves as a<br/>society; it's time we tried to grasp something of our social<br/>position, or at least to make a beginning in that direction.<br/><br/>"A great writer<br/>[20]<br/>of the<br/>last epoch, comparing Russia to a swift troika galloping to an<br/>unknown goal, exclaims, 'Oh, troika, birdlike troika, who invented<br/>thee!' and adds, in proud ecstasy, that all the peoples of the<br/>world stand aside respectfully to make way for the recklessly<br/>galloping troika to pass. That may be, they may stand aside,<br/>respectfully or no, but in my poor opinion the great writer ended<br/>his book in this way either in an excess of childish and naive<br/>optimism, or simply in fear of the censorship of the day. For if<br/>the troika were drawn by his heroes, Sobakevitch, Nozdryov,<br/>Tchitchikov, it could reach no rational goal, whoever might be<br/>driving it. And those were the heroes of an older generation, ours<br/>are worse specimens still… ." At this point Ippolit Kirillovitch's<br/>speech was interrupted by applause. The liberal significance of<br/>this simile was appreciated. The applause was, it's true, of brief<br/>duration, so that the President did not think it necessary to<br/>caution the public, and only looked severely in the direction of<br/>the offenders. But Ippolit Kirillovitch was encouraged; he had<br/>never been applauded before! He had been all his life unable to get<br/>a hearing, and now he suddenly had an opportunity of securing the<br/>ear of all Russia. "What, after all, is this Karamazov family,<br/>which has gained such an unenviable notoriety throughout Russia?"<br/>he continued. "Perhaps I am exaggerating, but it seems to me that<br/>certain fundamental features of the educated class of to-day are<br/>reflected in this family picture- only, of course, in miniature,<br/>'like the sun in a drop of water.' Think of that unhappy, vicious,<br/>unbridled old man, who has met with such a melancholy end, the head<br/>of a family! Beginning life of noble birth, but in a poor dependent<br/>position, through an unexpected marriage he came into a small<br/>fortune. A petty knave, a toady and buffoon, of fairly good, though<br/>undeveloped, intelligence, he was, above all, a moneylender, who<br/>grew bolder with growing prosperity. His abject and servile<br/>characteristics disappeared, his, malicious and sarcastic cynicism<br/>was all that remained. On the spiritual side he was undeveloped,<br/>while his vitality was excessive. He saw nothing in life but<br/>sensual pleasure, and he brought his children up to be the same. He<br/>had no feelings for his duties as a father. He ridiculed those<br/>duties. He left his little children to the servants, and was glad<br/>to be rid of them, forgot about them completely. The old man's<br/>maxim was Apres moi le deluge.* He was an example of everything<br/>that is opposed to civic duty, of the most complete and malignant<br/>individualism. 'The world may burn for aught I care, so long as I<br/>am all right,' and he was all right; he was content, he was eager<br/>to go on living in the same way for another twenty or thirty years.<br/>He swindled his own son and spent his money, his maternal<br/>inheritance, on trying to get his mistress from him. No, I don't<br/>intend to leave the prisoner's defence altogether to my talented<br/>colleague from Petersburg. I will speak the truth myself, I can<br/>well understand what resentment he had heaped up in his son's heart<br/>against him. After me, the deluge. "But enough, enough of that<br/>unhappy old man; he has paid the penalty. Let us remember, however,<br/>that he was a father, and one of the typical fathers of to-day. Am<br/>I unjust, indeed, in saying that he is typical of many modern<br/>fathers? Alas! many of them only differ in not openly professing<br/>such cynicism, for they are better educated, more cultured, but<br/>their philosophy is essentially the same as his. Perhaps I am a<br/>pessimist, but you have agreed to forgive me. Let us agree<br/>beforehand, you need not believe me, but let me speak. Let me say<br/>what I have to say, and remember something of my words. "Now for<br/>the children of this father, this head of a family. One of them is<br/>the prisoner before us, all the rest of my speech will deal with<br/>him. Of the other two I will speak only cursorily. "The elder is<br/>one of those modern young men of brilliant education and vigorous<br/>intellect, who has lost all faith in everything. He has denied and<br/>rejected much already, like his father. We have all heard him, he<br/>was a welcome guest in local society. He never concealed his<br/>opinions, quite the contrary in fact, which justifies me in<br/>speaking rather openly of him now, of course, not as an individual,<br/>but as a member of the Karamazov family. Another personage closely<br/>connected with the case died here by his own hand last night. I<br/>mean an afflicted idiot, formerly the servant, and possibly the<br/>illegitimate son, of Fyodor Pavlovitch, Smerdyakov. At the<br/>preliminary inquiry, he told me with hysterical tears how the young<br/>Ivan Karamazov had horrified him by his spiritual audacity.<br/>'Everything in the world is lawful according to him, and nothing<br/>must be forbidden in the future- that is what he always taught me.'<br/>I believe that idiot was driven out of his mind by this theory,<br/>though, of course, the epileptic attacks from which he suffered,<br/>and this terrible catastrophe, have helped to unhinge his<br/>faculties. But he dropped one very interesting observation, which<br/>would have done credit to a more intelligent observer, and that is,<br/>indeed, why I've mentioned it: 'If there is one of the sons that is<br/>like Fyodor Pavlovitch in character, it is Ivan Fyodorovitch.'<br/>"With that remark I conclude my sketch of his character, feeling it<br/>indelicate to continue further. Oh, I don't want to draw any<br/>further conclusions and croak like a raven over the young man's<br/>future. We've seen to-day in this court that there are still good<br/>impulses in his young heart, that family feeling has not been<br/>destroyed in him by lack of faith and cynicism, which have come to<br/>him rather by inheritance than by the exercise of independent<br/>thought. "Then the third son. Oh, he is a devout and modest youth,<br/>who does not share his elder brother's gloomy and destructive<br/>theory of life. He has sought to cling to the 'ideas of the<br/>people,' or to what goes by that name in some circles of our<br/>intellectual classes. He clung to the monastery, and was within an<br/>ace of becoming a monk. He seems to me to have betrayed<br/>unconsciously, and so early, that timid despair which leads so many<br/>in our unhappy society, who dread cynicism and its corrupting<br/>influences, and mistakenly attribute all the mischief to European<br/>enlightenment, to return to their 'native soil,' as they say, to<br/>the bosom, so to speak, of their mother earth, like frightened<br/>children, yearning to fall asleep on the withered bosom of their<br/>decrepit mother, and to sleep there for ever, only to escape the<br/>horrors that terrify them. "For my part I wish the excellent and<br/>gifted young man every success; I trust that youthful idealism and<br/>impulse towards the ideas of the people may never degenerate, as<br/>often happens, on the moral side into gloomy mysticism, and on the<br/>political into blind chauvinism- two elements which are even a<br/>greater menace to Russia than the premature decay, due to<br/>misunderstanding and gratuitous adoption of European ideas, from<br/>which his elder brother is suffering." Two or three people clapped<br/>their hands at the mention of chauvinism and mysticism. Ippolit<br/>Kirillovitch had been, indeed, carried away by his own eloquence.<br/>All this had little to do with the case in hand, to say nothing of<br/>the fact of its being somewhat vague, but the sickly and<br/>consumptive man was overcome by the desire to express himself once<br/>in his life. People said afterwards that he was actuated by<br/>unworthy motives in his criticism of Ivan, because the latter had<br/>on one or two occasions got the better of him in argument, and<br/>Ippolit Kirillovitch, remembering it, tried now to take his<br/>revenge. But I don't know whether it was true. All this was only<br/>introductory, however, and the speech passed to more direct<br/>consideration of the case. "But to return to the eldest son,"<br/>Ippolit Kirillovitch went on. "He is the prisoner before us. We<br/>have his life and his actions, too, before us; the fatal day has<br/>come and all has been brought to the surface. While his brothers<br/>seem to stand for 'Europeanism' and 'the principles of the people,'<br/>he seems to represent Russia as she is. Oh, not all Russia, not<br/>all! God preserve us, if it were! Yet, here we have her, our mother<br/>Russia, the very scent and sound of her. Oh, he is spontaneous, he<br/>is a marvellous mingling of good and evil, he is a lover of culture<br/>and Schiller, yet he brawls in taverns and plucks out the beards of<br/>his boon companions. Oh, he, too, can be good and noble, but only<br/>when all goes well with him. What is more, he can be carried off<br/>his feet, positively carried off his feet by noble ideals, but only<br/>if they come of themselves, if they fall from heaven for him, if<br/>they need not be paid for. He dislikes paying for anything, but is<br/>very fond of receiving, and that's so with him in everything. Oh,<br/>give him every possible good in life (he couldn't be content with<br/>less), and put no obstacle in his way, and he will show that he,<br/>too, can be noble. He is not greedy, no, but he must have money, a<br/>great deal of money, and you will see how generously, with what<br/>scorn of filthy lucre, he will fling it all away in the reckless<br/>dissipation of one night. But if he has not money, he will show<br/>what he is ready to do to get it when he is in great need of it.<br/>But all this later, let us take events in their chronological<br/>order. "First, we have before us a poor abandoned child, running<br/>about the back-yard 'without boots on his feet,' as our worthy and<br/>esteemed fellow citizen, of foreign origin, alas! expressed it just<br/>now. I repeat it again, I yield to no one the defence of the<br/>criminal. I am here to accuse him, but to defend him also. Yes, I,<br/>too, am human; I, too, can weigh the influence of home and<br/>childhood on the character. But the boy grows up and becomes an<br/>officer; for a duel and other reckless conduct he is exiled to one<br/>of the remote frontier towns of Russia. There he led a wild life as<br/>an officer. And, of course, he needed money, money before all<br/>things, and so after prolonged disputes he came to a settlement<br/>with his father, and the last six thousand was sent him. A letter<br/>is in existence in which he practically gives up his claim to the<br/>rest and settles his conflict with his father over the inheritance<br/>on the payment of this six thousand. "Then came his meeting with a<br/>young girl of lofty character and brilliant education. Oh, I do not<br/>venture to repeat the details; you have only just heard them.<br/>Honour, self-sacrifice were shown there, and I will be silent. The<br/>figure of the young officer, frivolous and profligate, doing homage<br/>to true nobility and a lofty ideal, was shown in a very sympathetic<br/>light before us. But the other side of the medal was unexpectedly<br/>turned to us immediately after in this very court. Again I will not<br/>venture to conjecture why it happened so, but there were causes.<br/>The same lady, bathed in tears of long-concealed indignation,<br/>alleged that he, he of all men, had despised her for her action,<br/>which, though incautious, reckless perhaps, was still dictated by<br/>lofty and generous motives. He, he, the girl's betrothed, looked at<br/>her with that smile of mockery, which was more insufferable from<br/>him than from anyone. And knowing that he had already deceived her<br/>(he had deceived her, believing that she was bound to endure<br/>everything from him, even treachery), she intentionally offered him<br/>three thousand roubles, and clearly, too clearly, let him<br/>understand that she was offering him money to deceive her. 'Well,<br/>will you take it or not, are you so lost to shame?' was the dumb<br/>question in her scrutinising eyes. He looked at her, saw clearly<br/>what was in her mind (he's admitted here before you that he<br/>understood it all), appropriated that three thousand<br/>unconditionally, and squandered it in two days with the new object<br/>of his affections. "What are we to believe then? The first legend<br/>of the young officer sacrificing his last farthing in a noble<br/>impulse of generosity and doing reverence to virtue, or this other<br/>revolting picture? As a rule, between two extremes one has to find<br/>the mean, but in the present case this is not true. The probability<br/>is that in the first case he was genuinely noble, and in the second<br/>as genuinely base. And why? Because he was of the broad Karamazov<br/>character- that's just what I am leading up to- capable of<br/>combining the most incongruous contradictions, and capable of the<br/>greatest heights and of the greatest depths. Remember the brilliant<br/>remark made by a young observer who has seen the Karamazov family<br/>at close quarters- Mr. Rakitin: 'The sense of their own degradation<br/>is as essential to those reckless, unbridled natures as the sense<br/>of their lofty generosity.' And that's true, they need continually<br/>this unnatural mixture. Two extremes at the same moment, or they<br/>are miserable and dissatisfied and their existence is incomplete.<br/>They are wide, wide as mother Russia; they include everything and<br/>put up with everything. "By the way, gentlemen of the jury, we've<br/>just touched upon that three thousand roubles, and I will venture<br/>to anticipate things a little. Can you conceive that a man like<br/>that, on receiving that sum and in such a way, at the price of such<br/>shame, such disgrace, such utter degradation, could have been<br/>capable that very day of setting apart half that sum, that very<br/>day, and sewing it up in a little bag, and would have had the<br/>firmness of character to carry it about with him for a whole month<br/>afterwards, in spite of every temptation and his extreme need of<br/>it! Neither in drunken debauchery in taverns, nor when he was<br/>flying into the country, trying to get from God knows whom, the<br/>money so essential to him to remove the object of his affections<br/>from being tempted by his father, did he bring himself to touch<br/>that little bag! Why, if only to avoid abandoning his mistress to<br/>the rival of whom he was so jealous, he would have been certain to<br/>have opened that bag and to have stayed at home to keep watch over<br/>her, and to await the moment when she would say to him at last 'I<br/>am yours,' and to fly with her far from their fatal surroundings.<br/>"But no, he did not touch his talisman, and what is the reason he<br/>gives for it? The chief reason, as I have just said, was that when<br/>she would say' I am yours, take me where you will,' he might have<br/>the wherewithal to take her. But that first reason, in the<br/>prisoner's own words, was of little weight beside the second. While<br/>I have that money on me, he said, I am a scoundrel, not a thief,<br/>for I can always go to my insulted betrothed, and, laying down half<br/>the sum I have fraudulently appropriated, I can always say to her,<br/>'You see, I've squandered half your money, and shown I am a weak<br/>and immoral man, and, if you like, a scoundrel' (I use the<br/>prisoner's own expressions), 'but though I am a scoundrel, I am not<br/>a thief, for if I had been a thief, I shouldn't have brought you<br/>back this half of the money, but should have taken it as I did the<br/>other half!' A marvellous explanation! This frantic, but weak man,<br/>who could not resist the temptation of accepting the three thousand<br/>roubles at the price of such disgrace, this very man suddenly<br/>develops the most stoical firmness, and carries about a thousand<br/>roubles without daring to touch it. Does that fit in at all with<br/>the character we have analysed? No, and I venture to tell you how<br/>the real Dmitri Karamazov would have behaved in such circumstances,<br/>if he really had brought himself to put away the money. "At the<br/>first temptation- for instance, to entertain the woman with whom he<br/>had already squandered half the money- he would have unpicked his<br/>little bag and have taken out some hundred roubles, for why should<br/>he have taken back precisely half the money, that is, fifteen<br/>hundred roubles? Why not fourteen hundred? He could just as well<br/>have said then that he was not a thief, because he brought back<br/>fourteen hundred roubles. Then another time he would have unpicked<br/>it again and taken out another hundred, and then a third, and then<br/>a fourth, and before the end of the month he would have taken the<br/>last note but one, feeling that if he took back only a hundred it<br/>would answer the purpose, for a thief would have stolen it all. And<br/>then he would have looked at this last note, and have said to<br/>himself, 'It's really not worth while to give back one hundred;<br/>let's spend that, too!' That's how the real Dmitri Karamazov, as we<br/>know him, would have behaved. One cannot imagine anything more<br/>incongruous with the actual fact than this legend of the little<br/>bag. Nothing could be more inconceivable. But we shall return to<br/>that later." After touching upon what had come out in the<br/>proceedings concerning the financial relations of father and son,<br/>and arguing again and again that it was utterly impossible, from<br/>the facts known, to determine which was in the wrong, Ippolit<br/>Kirillovitch passed to the evidence of the medical experts in<br/>reference to Mitya's fixed idea about the three thousand owing<br/>him.<br/>
