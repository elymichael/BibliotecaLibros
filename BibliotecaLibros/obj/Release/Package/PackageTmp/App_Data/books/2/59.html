"You are welcome with all my heart," answered the Superior.<br/>"Gentlemen!" he added, "I venture to beg you most earnestly to lay<br/>aside your dissensions, and to be united in love and family<br/>harmony- with prayer to the Lord at our humble table."<br/><br/>"No, no, it is impossible!" cried Miusov, beside himself.<br/><br/>"Well, if it is impossible for Pyotr Alexandrovitch, it is<br/>impossible for me, and I won't stop. That is why I came. I will<br/>keep with Pyotr Alexandrovitch everywhere now. If you will go away,<br/>Pyotr Alexandrovitch, I will go away too, if you remain, I will<br/>remain. You stung him by what you said about family harmony, Father<br/>Superior, he does not admit he is my relation. That's right, isn't<br/>it, von Sohn? Here's von Sohn. How are you, von Sohn?"<br/><br/>"Do you mean me?" muttered Maximov, puzzled.<br/><br/>"Of course I mean you," cried Fyodor Pavlovitch. "Who else? The<br/>Father Superior could not be von Sohn."<br/><br/>"But I am not von Sohn either. I am Maximov."<br/><br/>"No, you are von Sohn. Your reverence, do you know who von Sohn<br/>was? It was a famous murder case. He was killed in a house of<br/>harlotry- I believe that is what such places are called among you-<br/>he was killed and robbed, and in spite of his venerable age, he was<br/>nailed up in a box and sent from Petersburg to Moscow in the<br/>luggage van, and while they were nailing him up, the harlots sang<br/>songs and played the harp, that is to say, the piano. So this is<br/>that very von Solin. He has risen from the dead, hasn't he, von<br/>Sohn?"<br/><br/>"What is happening? What's this?" voices were heard in the group<br/>of monks.<br/><br/>"Let us go," cried Miusov, addressing Kalganov.<br/><br/>"No, excuse me," Fyodor Pavlovitch broke in shrilly, taking<br/>another step into the room. "Allow me to finish. There in the cell<br/>you blamed me for behaving disrespectfully just because I spoke of<br/>eating gudgeon, Pyotr Alexandrovitch. Miusov, my relation, prefers<br/>to have plus de noblesse que de sincerite in his words, but I<br/>prefer in mine plus de sincerite que de noblesse, and- damn the<br/>noblesse! That's right, isn't it, von Sohn? Allow me, Father<br/>Superior, though I am a buffoon and play the buffoon, yet I am the<br/>soul of honour, and I want to speak my mind. Yes, I am the soul of<br/>honour, while in Pyotr Alexandrovitch there is wounded vanity and<br/>nothing else. I came here perhaps to have a look and speak my mind.<br/>My son, Alexey, is here, being saved. I am his father; I care for<br/>his welfare, and it is my duty to care. While I've been playing the<br/>fool, I have been listening and having a look on the sly; and now I<br/>want to give you the last act of the performance. You know how<br/>things are with us? As a thing falls, so it lies. As a thing once<br/>has fallen, so it must lie for ever. Not a bit of it! I want to get<br/>up again. Holy Father, I am indignant with you. Confession is a<br/>great sacrament, before which I am ready to bow down reverently;<br/>but there in the cell, they all kneel down and confess aloud. Can<br/>it be right to confess aloud? It was ordained by the holy Fathers<br/>to confess in secret: then only your confession will be a mystery,<br/>and so it was of old. But how can I explain to him before everyone<br/>that I did this and that… well, you understand what- sometimes it<br/>would not be proper to talk about it- so it is really a scandal!<br/>No, Fathers, one might be carried along with you to the<br/>Flagellants, I dare say… . at the first opportunity I shall write<br/>to the Synod, and I shall take my son, Alexey, home."<br/><br/>We must note here that Fyodor Pavlovitch knew where to look for<br/>the weak spot. There had been at one time malicious rumours which<br/>had even reached the Archbishop (not only regarding our monastery,<br/>but in others where the institution of elders existed) that too<br/>much respect was paid to the elders, even to the detriment of the<br/>authority of the Superior, that the elders abused the sacrament of<br/>confession and so on and so on- absurd charges which had died away<br/>of themselves everywhere. But the spirit of folly, which had caught<br/>up Fyodor Pavlovitch and was bearing him on the current of his own<br/>nerves into lower and lower depths of ignominy, prompted him with<br/>this old slander. Fyodor Pavlovitch did not understand a word of<br/>it, and he could not even put it sensibly, for on this occasion no<br/>one had been kneeling and confessing aloud in the elder's cell, so<br/>that he could not have seen anything of the kind. He was only<br/>speaking from confused memory of old slanders. But as soon as he<br/>had uttered his foolish tirade, he felt he had been talking absurd<br/>nonsense, and at once longed to prove to his audience, and above<br/>all to himself, that he had not been talking nonsense. And, though<br/>he knew perfectly well that with each word he would be adding more<br/>and more absurdity, he could not restrain himself, and plunged<br/>forward blindly.<br/>
