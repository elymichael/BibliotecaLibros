Lise seemed extraordinarily impressed and for half a minute she<br/>was silent.<br/><br/>"Alyosha, come and see me, come and see me more often," she said<br/>suddenly, in a supplicating voice.<br/><br/>"I'll always come to see you, all my life," answered Alyosha<br/>firmly.<br/><br/>"You are the only person I can talk to, you know," Lise began<br/>again. "I talk to no one but myself and you. Only you in the whole<br/>world. And to you more readily than to myself. And I am not a bit<br/>ashamed with you, not a bit. Alyosha, why am I not ashamed with<br/>you, not a bit? Alyosha, is it true that at Easter the Jews steal a<br/>child and kill it?"<br/><br/>"I don't know."<br/><br/>"There's a book here in which I read about the trial of a Jew,<br/>who took a child of four years old and cut off the fingers from<br/>both hands, and then crucified him on the wall, hammered nails into<br/>him and crucified him, and afterwards, when he was tried, he said<br/>that the child died soon, within four hours. That was 'soon'! He<br/>said the child moaned, kept on moaning and he stood admiring it.<br/>That's nice!"<br/><br/>"Nice?"<br/><br/>"Nice; I sometimes imagine that it was I who crucified him. He<br/>would hang there moaning and I would sit opposite him eating<br/>pineapple compote. I am awfully fond of pineapple compote. Do you<br/>like it?"<br/><br/>Alyosha looked at her in silence. Her pale, sallow face was<br/>suddenly contorted, her eyes burned.<br/><br/>"You know, when I read about that Jew I shook with sobs all<br/>night. I kept fancying how the little thing cried and moaned (a<br/>child of four years old understands, you know), and all the while<br/>the thought of pineapple compote haunted me. In the morning I wrote<br/>a letter to a certain person, begging him particularly to come and<br/>see me. He came and I suddenly told him all about the child and the<br/>pineapple compote. All about it, all, and said that it was nice. He<br/>laughed and said it really was nice. Then he got up and went away.<br/>He was only here five minutes. Did he despise me? Did he despise<br/>me? Tell me, tell me, Alyosha, did he despise me or not?" She sat<br/>up on the couch, with flashing eyes.<br/><br/>"Tell me," Alyosha asked anxiously, "did you send for that<br/>person?"<br/>
