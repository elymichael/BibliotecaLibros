"I know that you asked him not to visit you for the future, but<br/>why it was, I haven't heard… from you, at least."<br/><br/>"Ah, then you've heard it from him! He abuses me, I suppose,<br/>abuses me dreadfully?"<br/><br/>"Yes, he does; but then he abuses everyone. But why you've given<br/>him up I, haven't heard from him either. I meet him very seldom<br/>now, indeed. We are not friends."<br/><br/>"Well, then, I'll tell you all about it. There's no help for it,<br/>I'll confess, for there is one point in which I was perhaps to<br/>blame. Only a little, little point, so little that perhaps it<br/>doesn't count. You see, my dear boy"- Madame Hohlakov suddenly<br/>looked arch and a charming, though enigmatic, smile played about<br/>her lips- "you see, I suspect… You must forgive me, Alyosha. I am<br/>like a mother to you… No, no; quite the contrary. I speak to you<br/>now as though you were my father- mother's quite out of place.<br/>Well, it's as though I were confessing to Father Zossima, that's<br/>just it. I called you a monk just now. Well, that poor young man,<br/>your friend, Rakitin (Mercy on us! I can't be angry with him. I<br/>feel cross, but not very), that frivolous young man, would you<br/>believe it, seems to have taken it into his head to fall in love<br/>with me. I only noticed it later. At first- a month ago- he only<br/>began to come oftener to see me, almost every day; though, of<br/>course, we were acquainted before. I knew nothing about it… and<br/>suddenly it dawned upon me, and I began to notice things with<br/>surprise. You know, two months ago, that modest, charming,<br/>excellent young man, Ilyitch Perhotin, who's in the service here,<br/>began to be a regular visitor at the house. You met him here ever<br/>so many times yourself. And he is an excellent, earnest young man,<br/>isn't he? He comes once every three days, not every day (though I<br/>should be glad to see him every day), and always so well dressed.<br/>Altogether, I love young people, Alyosha, talented, modest, like<br/>you, and he has almost the mind of a statesman, he talks so<br/>charmingly, and I shall certainly, certainly try and get promotion<br/>for him. He is a future diplomat. On that awful day he almost saved<br/>me from death by coming in the night. And your friend Rakitin comes<br/>in such boots, and always stretches them out on the carpet… . He<br/>began hinting at his feelings, in fact, and one day, as he was<br/>going, he squeezed my hand terribly hard. My foot began to swell<br/>directly after he pressed my hand like that. He had met Pyotr<br/>Ilyitch here before, and would you believe it, he is always gibing<br/>at him, growling at him, for some reason. I simply looked at the<br/>way they went on together and laughed inwardly. So I was sitting<br/>here alone- no, I was laid up then. Well, I was lying here alone<br/>and suddenly Rakitin comes in, and only fancy! brought me some<br/>verses of his own composition- a short poem, on my bad foot: that<br/>is, he described my foot in a poem. Wait a minute- how did it<br/>go?<br/><br/>A captivating little foot.<br/><br/>It began somehow like that. I can never remember poetry. I've<br/>got it here. I'll show it to you later. But it's a charming thing-<br/>charming; and, you know, it's not only about the foot, it had a<br/>good moral, too, a charming idea, only I've forgotten it; in fact,<br/>it was just the thing for an album. So, of course, I thanked him,<br/>and he was evidently flattered. I'd hardly had time to thank him<br/>when in comes Pyotr Ilyitch, and Rakitin suddenly looked as black<br/>as night. I could see that Pyotr Ilyitch was in the way, for<br/>Rakitin certainly wanted to say something after giving me the<br/>verses. I had a presentiment of it; but Pyotr Ilyitch came in. I<br/>showed Pyotr Ilyitch the verses and didn't say who was the author.<br/>But I am convinced that he guessed, though he won't own it to this<br/>day, and declares he had no idea. But he says that on purpose.<br/>Pyotr Ilyitch began to laugh at once, and fell to criticising it.<br/>'Wretched doggerel,' he said they were, 'some divinity student must<br/>have written them,' and with such vehemence, such vehemence! Then,<br/>instead of laughing, your friend flew into a rage. 'Good gracious!'<br/>I thought, 'they'll fly at each other.' 'It was I who wrote them,'<br/>said he. 'I wrote them as a joke,' he said, 'for I think it<br/>degrading to write verses… . But they are good poetry. They want to<br/>put a monument to your Pushkin for writing about women's feet,<br/>while I wrote with a moral purpose, and you,' said he, 'are an<br/>advocate of serfdom. You've no humane ideas,' said he. 'You have no<br/>modern enlightened feelings, you are uninfluenced by progress, you<br/>are a mere official,' he said, 'and you take bribes.' Then I began<br/>screaming and imploring them. And, you know, Pyotr Ilyitch is<br/>anything but a coward. He at once took up the most gentlemanly<br/>tone, looked at him sarcastically, listened, and apologised. 'I'd<br/>no idea,' said he. 'I shouldn't have said it, if I had known. I<br/>should have praised it. Poets are all so irritable,' he said. In<br/>short, he laughed at him under cover of the most gentlemanly tone.<br/>He explained to me afterwards that it was all sarcastic. I thought<br/>he was in earnest. Only as I lay there, just as before you now, I<br/>thought, 'Would it, or would it not, be the proper thing for me to<br/>turn Rakitin out for shouting so rudely at a visitor in my house?'<br/>And, would you believe it, I lay here, shut my eyes, and wondered,<br/>would it be the proper thing or not. I kept worrying and worrying,<br/>and my heart began to beat, and I couldn't make up my mind whether<br/>to make an outcry or not. One voice seemed to be telling me,<br/>'Speak,' and the other 'No, don't speak.' And no sooner had the<br/>second voice said that than I cried out, and fainted. Of course,<br/>there was a fuss. I got up suddenly and said to Rakitin, 'It's<br/>painful for me to say it, but I don't wish to see you in my house<br/>again.' So I turned him out. Ah! Alexey Fyodorovitch, I know myself<br/>I did wrong. I was putting it on. I wasn't angry with him at all,<br/>really; but I suddenly fancied- that was what did it- that it would<br/>be such a fine scene… . And yet, believe me, it was quite natural,<br/>for I really shed tears and cried for several days afterwards, and<br/>then suddenly, one afternoon, I forgot all about it. So it's a<br/>fortnight since he's been here, and I kept wondering whether he<br/>would come again. I wondered even yesterday, then suddenly last<br/>night came this Gossip. I read it and gasped. Who could have<br/>written it? He must have written it. He went home, sat down, wrote<br/>it on the spot, sent it, and they put it in. It was a fortnight<br/>ago, you see. But, Alyosha, it's awful how I keep talking and don't<br/>say what I want to say. the words come of themselves!"<br/><br/>"It's very important for me to be in time to see my brother<br/>to-day," Alyosha faltered.<br/><br/>"To be sure, to be sure! You bring it all back to me. Listen,<br/>what is an aberration?"<br/><br/>"What aberration?" asked Alyosha, wondering.<br/><br/>"In the legal sense. An aberration in which everything is<br/>pardonable. Whatever you do, you will be acquitted at once."<br/><br/>"What do you mean?"<br/>
