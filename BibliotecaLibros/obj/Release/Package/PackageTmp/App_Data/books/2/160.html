Alyosha stood still, holding her hand in his. Suddenly he<br/>stooped down and kissed her on her lips.<br/><br/>"Oh, what are you doing?" cried Lise. Alyosha was terribly<br/>abashed.<br/><br/>"Oh, forgive me if I shouldn't… . Perhaps I'm awfully stupid… .<br/>You said I was cold, so I kissed you… . But I see it was<br/>stupid."<br/><br/>Lise laughed, and hid her face in her hands. "And in that<br/>dress!" she ejaculated in the midst of her mirth. But she suddenly<br/>ceased laughing and became serious, almost stern.<br/><br/>"Alyosha, we must put off kissing. We are not ready for that<br/>yet, and we shall have a long time to wait," she ended suddenly.<br/>"Tell me rather why you who are so clever, so intellectual, so<br/>observant, choose a little idiot, an invalid like me? Ah, Alyosha,<br/>I am awfully happy, for I don't deserve you a bit."<br/><br/>"You do, Lise. I shall be leaving the monastery altogether in a<br/>few days. If I go into the world, I must marry. I know that. He<br/>told me to marry, too. Whom could I marry better than you- and who<br/>would have me except you? I have been thinking it over. In the<br/>first place, you've known me from a child and you've a great many<br/>qualities I haven't. You are more light-hearted than I am; above<br/>all, you are more innocent than I am. I have been brought into<br/>contact with many, many things already… . Ah, you don't know, but<br/>I, too, am a Karamazov. What does it matter if you do laugh and<br/>make jokes, and at me, too? Go on laughing. I am so glad you do.<br/>You laugh like a little child, but you think like a martyr."<br/><br/>"Like a martyr? How?"<br/><br/>"Yes, Lise, your question just now: whether we weren't showing<br/>contempt for that poor man by dissecting his soul- that was the<br/>question of a sufferer… . You see, I don't know how to express it,<br/>but anyone who thinks of such questions is capable of suffering.<br/>Sitting in your invalid chair you must have thought over many<br/>things already."<br/><br/>"Alyosha, give me your hand. Why are you taking it away?"<br/>murmured Lise in a failing voice, weak with happiness. "Listen,<br/>Alyosha. What will you wear when you come out of the monastery?<br/>What sort of suit? Don't laugh, don't be angry, it's very, very<br/>important to me."<br/><br/>"I haven't thought about the suit, Lise; But I'll wear whatever<br/>you like."<br/><br/>"I should like you to have a dark blue velvet coat, a white<br/>pique waistcoat, and a soft grey felt hat… . Tell me, did you<br/>believe that I didn't care for you when I said I didn't mean what I<br/>wrote?"<br/>
