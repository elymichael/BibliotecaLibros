The President again and again warned Mitya impressively and very<br/>sternly to be more careful in his language.<br/><br/>"You are injuring yourself in the opinion of your judges."<br/><br/>The counsel for the defence was equally clever in dealing with<br/>the evidence of Rakitin. I may remark that Rakitin was one of the<br/>leading witnesses and one to whom the prosecutor attached great<br/>significance. It appeared that he knew everything; his knowledge<br/>was amazing, he had been everywhere, seen everything, talked to<br/>everybody, knew every detail of the biography of Fyodor Pavlovitch<br/>and all the Karamazovs. Of the envelope, it is true, he had only<br/>heard from Mitya himself. But he described minutely Mitya's<br/>exploits in the Metropolis, all his compromising doings and<br/>sayings, and told the story of Captain Snegiryov's "wisp of tow."<br/>But even Rakitin could say nothing positive about Mitya's<br/>inheritance, and confined himself to contemptuous generalities.<br/><br/>"Who could tell which of them was to blame, and which was in<br/>debt to the other, with their crazy Karamazov way of muddling<br/>things so that no one could make head or tail of it?" He attributed<br/>the tragic crime to the habits that had become ingrained by ages of<br/>serfdom and the distressed condition of Russia, due to the lack of<br/>appropriate institutions. He was, in fact, allowed some latitude of<br/>speech. This was the first occasion on which Rakitin showed what he<br/>could do, and attracted notice. The prosecutor knew that the<br/>witness was preparing a magazine article on the case, and<br/>afterwards in his speech, as we shall see later, quoted some ideas<br/>from the article, showing that he had seen it already. The picture<br/>drawn by the witness was a gloomy and sinister one, and greatly<br/>strengthened the case for the prosecution. Altogether, Rakatin's<br/>discourse fascinated the public by its independence and the<br/>extraordinary nobility of its ideas. There were even two or three<br/>outbreaks of applause when he spoke of serfdom and the distressed<br/>condition of Russia.<br/><br/>But Rakitin, in his youthful ardour, made a slight blunder, of<br/>which the counsel for the defence at once adroitly took advantage.<br/>Answering certain questions about Grushenka and carried away by the<br/>loftiness of his own sentiments and his success, of which he was,<br/>of course, conscious, he went so far as to speak somewhat<br/>contemptuously of Agrafena Alexandrovna as "the kept mistress of<br/>Samsonov." He would have given a good deal to take back his words<br/>afterwards, for Fetyukovitch caught him out over it at once. And it<br/>was all because Rakitin had not reckoned on the lawyer having been<br/>able to become so intimately acquainted with every detail in so<br/>short a time.<br/><br/>"Allow me to ask," began the counsel for the defence, with the<br/>most affable and even respectful smile, "you are, of course, the<br/>same Mr. Rakitin whose pamphlet, The Life of the Deceased Elder,<br/>Father Zossima, published by the diocesan authorities, full of<br/>profound and religious reflections and preceded by an excellent and<br/>devout dedication to the bishop, I have just read with such<br/>pleasure?"<br/><br/>"I did not write it for publication… it was published<br/>afterwards," muttered Rakitin, for some reason fearfully<br/>disconcerted and almost ashamed.<br/><br/>"Oh, that's excellent! A thinker like you can, and indeed ought<br/>to, take the widest view of every social question. Your most<br/>instructive pamphlet has been widely circulated through the<br/>patronage of the bishop, and has been of appreciable service… . But<br/>this is the chief thing I should like to learn from you. You stated<br/>just now that you were very intimately acquainted with Madame<br/>Svyetlov." (It must be noted that Grushenka's surname was Svyetlov.<br/>I heard it for the first time that day, during the case.)<br/><br/>"I cannot answer for all my acquaintances… . I am a young man…<br/>and who can be responsible for everyone he meets?" cried Rakitin,<br/>flushing all over.<br/><br/>"I understand, I quite understand," cried Fetyukovitch; as<br/>though he, too, were embarrassed and in haste to excuse himself.<br/>"You, like any other, might well be interested in an acquaintance<br/>with a young and beautiful woman who would readily entertain the<br/>elite of the youth of the neighbourhood, but… I only wanted to<br/>know… It has come to my knowledge, that Madame Svyetlov was<br/>particularly anxious a couple of months ago to make the<br/>acquaintance of the younger Karamazov, Alexey Fyodorovitch, and<br/>promised you twenty-five roubles, if you would bring him to her in<br/>his monastic dress. And that actually took place on the evening of<br/>the day on which the terrible crime, which is the subject of the<br/>present investigation, was committed. You brought Alexey Karamazov<br/>to Madame Svyetlov, and did you receive the twenty-five roubles<br/>from Madame Svyetlov as a reward, that's what I wanted to hear from<br/>you?"<br/><br/>"It was a joke… . I don't, see of what interest that can be to<br/>you… . I took it for a joke… meaning to give it back later… "<br/>
