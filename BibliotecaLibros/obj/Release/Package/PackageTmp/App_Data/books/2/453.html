<br/>"Didn't go off with Onyegin? Surely you don't… understand that<br/>already?"<br/><br/>"Why, you seem to take me for little Smurov," said Kolya, with a<br/>grin of irritation. "But please don't suppose I am such a<br/>revolutionist. I often disagree with Mr. Rakitin. Though I mention<br/>Tatyana, I am not at all for the emancipation of women. I<br/>acknowledge that women are a subject race and must obey. Les femmes<br/>tricottent,<br/>[12]<br/>Napoleon said." Kolya, for some reason,<br/>smiled, "And on that question at least I am quite of one mind with<br/>that pseudo-great man. I think, too, that to leave one's own<br/>country and fly to America is mean, worse than mean- silly. Why go<br/>to America when one may be of great service to humanity here? Now<br/>especially. There's a perfect mass of fruitful activity open to us.<br/>That's what I answered." "What do you mean? Answered whom? Has<br/>someone suggested your going to America already?" "I must own,<br/>they've been at me to go, but I declined. That's between ourselves,<br/>of course, Karamazov; do you hear, not a word to anyone. I say this<br/>only to you. I am not at all anxious to fall into the clutches of<br/>the secret police and take lessons at the Chain bridge. Long will<br/>you remember The house at the Chain bridge. Do you remember? It's<br/>splendid. Why are you laughing? You don't suppose I am fibbing, do<br/>you?" ("What if he should find out that I've only that one number<br/>of The Bell in father's book case, and haven't read any more of<br/>it?" Kolya thought with a shudder.) "Oh no, I am not laughing and<br/>don't suppose for a moment that you are lying. No, indeed, I can't<br/>suppose so, for all this, alas! is perfectly true. But tell me,<br/>have you read Pushkin- Onyegin, for instance?… You spoke just now<br/>of Tatyana." "No, I haven't read it yet, but I want to read it. I<br/>have no prejudices, Karamazov; I want to hear both sides. What<br/>makes you ask?" "Oh, nothing." "Tell me, Karamazov, have you an<br/>awful contempt for me?" Kolya rapped out suddenly and drew himself<br/>up before Alyosha, as though he were on drill. "Be so kind as to<br/>tell me, without beating about the bush." "I have a contempt for<br/>you?" Alyosha looked at him wondering. "What for? I am only sad<br/>that a charming nature such as yours should be perverted by all<br/>this crude nonsense before you have begun life." "Don't be anxious<br/>about my nature," Kolya interrupted, not without complacency. "But<br/>it's true that I am stupidly sensitive, crudely sensitive. You<br/>smiled just now, and I fancied you seemed to-" "Oh, my smile meant<br/>something quite different. I'll tell you why I smiled. Not long ago<br/>I read the criticism made by a German who had lived in Russia, on<br/>our students and schoolboys of to-day. 'Show a Russian schoolboy,'<br/>he writes, 'a map of the stars, which he knows nothing about, and<br/>he will give you back the map next day with corrections on it.' No<br/>knowledge and unbounded conceit- that's what the German meant to<br/>say about the Russian schoolboy." "Yes, that's perfectly right,"<br/>Kolya laughed suddenly, "exactly so! Bravo the German! But he did<br/>not see the good side, what do you think? Conceit may be, that<br/>comes from youth, that will be corrected if need be, but, on the<br/>other hand, there is an independent spirit almost from childhood,<br/>boldness of thought and conviction, and not the spirit of these<br/>sausage makers, grovelling before authority… . But the German was<br/>right all the same. Bravo the German! But Germans want strangling<br/>all the same. Though they are so good at science and learning they<br/>must be strangled." "Strangled, what for?" smiled Alyosha. "Well,<br/>perhaps I am talking nonsense, I agree. I am awfully childish<br/>sometimes, and when I am pleased about anything I can't restrain<br/>myself and am ready to talk any stuff. But, I say, we are<br/>chattering away here about nothing, and that doctor has been a long<br/>time in there. But perhaps he's examining the mamma and that poor<br/>crippled Nina. I liked that Nina, you know. She whispered to me<br/>suddenly as I was coming away, 'Why didn't you come before?' And in<br/>such a voice, so reproachfully! I think she is awfully nice and<br/>pathetic." "Yes, yes! Well, you'll be coming often, you will see<br/>what she is like. It would do you a great deal of good to know<br/>people like that, to learn to value a great deal which you will<br/>find out from knowing these people," Alyosha observed warmly. "That<br/>would have more effect on you than anything." "Oh, how I regret and<br/>blame myself for not having come sooner!" Kolya exclaimed, with<br/>bitter feeling. "Yes, it's a great pity. You saw for yourself how<br/>delighted the poor child was to see you. And how he fretted for you<br/>to come!" "Don't tell me! You make it worse! But it serves me<br/>right. What kept me from coming was my conceit, my egoistic vanity,<br/>and the beastly wilfulness, which I never can get rid of, though<br/>I've been struggling with it all my life. I see that now. I am a<br/>beast in lots of ways, Karamazov!" "No, you have a charming nature,<br/>though it's been distorted, and I quite understand why you have had<br/>such an influence on this generous, morbidly sensitive boy,"<br/>Alyosha answered warmly. "And you say that to me!" cried Kolya;<br/>"and would you believe it, I thought- I've thought several times<br/>since I've been here- that you despised me! If only you knew how I<br/>prize your opinion!" "But are you really so sensitive? At your age!<br/>Would you believe it, just now, when you were telling your story, I<br/>thought, as I watched you, that you must be very sensitive!" "You<br/>thought so? What an eye you've got, I say! I bet that was when I<br/>was talking about the goose. That was just when I was fancying you<br/>had a great contempt for me for being in such a hurry to show off,<br/>and for a moment I quite hated you for it, and began talking like a<br/>fool. Then I fancied- just now, here- when I said that if there<br/>were no God He would have to be invented, that I was in too great a<br/>hurry to display my knowledge, especially as I got that phrase out<br/>of a book. But I swear I wasn't showing off out of vanity, though I<br/>really don't know why. Because I was so pleased? Yes, I believe it<br/>was because I was so pleased… though it's perfectly disgraceful for<br/>anyone to be gushing directly they are pleased, I know that. But I<br/>am convinced now that you don't despise me; it was all my<br/>imagination. Oh, Karamazov, I am profoundly unhappy. I sometimes<br/>fancy all sorts of things, that everyone is laughing at me, the<br/>whole world, and then I feel ready to overturn the whole order of<br/>things." "And you worry everyone about you," smiled Alyosha. "Yes,<br/>I worry everyone about me, especially my mother. Karamazov, tell<br/>me, am I very ridiculous now?" "Don't think about that, don't think<br/>of it at all!" cried Alyosha. "And what does ridiculous mean? Isn't<br/>everyone constantly being or seeming ridiculous? Besides, nearly<br/>all clever people now are fearfully afraid of being ridiculous, and<br/>that makes them unhappy. All I am surprised at is that you should<br/>be feeling that so early, though I've observed it for some time<br/>past,, not only in you. Nowadays the very children have begun to<br/>suffer from it. It's almost a sort of insanity. The devil has taken<br/>the form of that vanity and entered into the whole generation; it's<br/>simply the devil," added Alyosha, without a trace of the smile that<br/>Kolya, staring at him, expected to see. "You are like everyone<br/>else," said Alyosha, in conclusion, "that is, like very many<br/>others. Only you must not be like everybody else, that's all."<br/>"Even if everyone is like that?" "Yes, even if everyone is like<br/>that. You be the only one not like it. You really are not like<br/>everyone else, here you are not ashamed to confess to something bad<br/>and even ridiculous. And who will admit so much in these days? No<br/>one. And people have even ceased to feel the impulse to<br/>self-criticism. Don't be like everyone else, even if you are the<br/>only one." "Splendid! I was not mistaken in you. You know how to<br/>console one. Oh, how I have longed to know you, Karamazov! I've<br/>long been eager for this meeting. Can you really have thought about<br/>me, too? You said just now that you thought of me, too?" "Yes, I'd<br/>heard of you and had thought of you, too… and if it's partly vanity<br/>that makes you ask, it doesn't matter." "Do you know, Karamazov,<br/>our talk has been like a declaration of love," said Kolya, in a<br/>bashful and melting voice. "That's not ridiculous, is it?" "Not at<br/>all ridiculous, and if it were, it wouldn't matter, because it's<br/>been a good thing." Alyosha smiled brightly. "But do you know,<br/>Karamazov, you must admit that you are a little ashamed yourself,<br/>now… . I see it by your eyes." Kolya smiled with a sort of sly<br/>happiness. "Why ashamed?" "Well, why are you blushing?" "It was you<br/>made me blush," laughed Alyosha, and he really did blush. "Oh,<br/>well, I am a little, goodness knows why, I don't know… " he<br/>muttered, almost embarrassed. "Oh, how I love you and admire you at<br/>this moment just because you are rather ashamed! Because you are<br/>just like me," cried Kolya, in positive ecstasy. His cheeks glowed,<br/>his eyes beamed. "You know, Kolya, you will be very unhappy in your<br/>life," something made Alyosha say suddenly. "I know, I know. How<br/>you know it all before hand!" Kolya agreed at once. "But you will<br/>bless life on the whole, all the same." "Just so, hurrah! You are a<br/>prophet. Oh, we shall get on together, Karamazov! Do you know, what<br/>delights me most, is that you treat me quite like an equal. But we<br/>are not equals, no, we are not, you are better! But we shall get<br/>on. Do you know, all this last month, I've been saying to myself,<br/>'Either we shall be friends at once, for ever, or we shall part<br/>enemies to the grave!'" "And saying that, of course, you loved me,"<br/>Alyosha laughed gaily. "I did. I loved you awfully. I've been<br/>loving and dreaming of you. And how do you know it all beforehand?<br/>Ah, here's the doctor. Goodness! What will he tell us? Look at his<br/>face!"<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
