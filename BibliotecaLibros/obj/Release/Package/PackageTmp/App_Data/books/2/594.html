"They won't let her go out there to you," Alyosha put in at<br/>once.<br/><br/>"And there is something else I wanted tell you," Mitya went on,<br/>with a sudden ring in his voice. "If they beat me on the way or out<br/>there, I won't submit to it. I shall kill someone, and shall be<br/>shot for it. And this will be going on for twenty years! They speak<br/>to me rudely as it is. I've been lying here all night, passing<br/>judgment on myself. I am not ready! I am not able to resign myself.<br/>I wanted to sing a 'hymn'; but if a guard speaks rudely to me, I<br/>have not the strength to bear it. For Grusha I would bear anything…<br/>anything except blows… . But she won't be allowed to come<br/>there."<br/><br/>Alyosha smiled gently.<br/><br/>"Listen, brother, once for all," he said. "This is what I think<br/>about it. And you know that I would not tell you a lie. Listen: you<br/>are not ready, and such a cross is not for you. What's more, you<br/>don't need such a martyr's cross when you are not ready for it. If<br/>you had murdered our father, it would grieve me that you should<br/>reject your punishment. But you are innocent, and such a cross is<br/>too much for you. You wanted to make yourself another man by<br/>suffering. I say, only remember that other man always, all your<br/>life and wherever you go; and that will be enough for you. Your<br/>refusal of that great cross will only serve to make you feel all<br/>your life even greater duty, and that constant feeling will do more<br/>to make you a new man, perhaps, than if you went there. For there<br/>you would not endure it and would repine, and perhaps at last would<br/>say: 'I am quits.' The lawyer was right about that. Such heavy<br/>burdens are not for all men. For some they are impossible. These<br/>are my thoughts about it, if you want them so much. If other men<br/>would have to answer for your escape, officers or soldiers, then I<br/>would not have 'allowed' you," smiled Alyosha. "But they declare-<br/>the superintendent of that etape<br/>[21]<br/>told<br/>Ivan himself- that if it's well managed there will be no great<br/>inquiry, and that they can get off easily. Of course, bribing is<br/>dishonest even in such a case, but I can't undertake to judge about<br/>it, because if Ivan and Katya commissioned me to act for you, I<br/>know I should go and give bribes. I must tell you the truth. And so<br/>I can't judge of your own action. But let me assure you that I<br/>shall never condemn you. And it would be a strange thing if I could<br/>judge you in this. Now I think I've gone into everything." "But I<br/>do condemn myself!" cried Mitya. "I shall escape, that was settled<br/>apart from you; could Mitya Karamazov do anything but run away? But<br/>I shall condemn myself, and I will pray for my sin for ever. That's<br/>how the Jesuits talk, isn't it? Just as we are doing?" "Yes."<br/>Alyosha smiled gently. "I love you for always telling the whole<br/>truth and never hiding anything," cried Mitya, with a joyful laugh.<br/>"So I've caught my Alyosha being Jesuitical. I must kiss you for<br/>that. Now listen to the rest; I'll open the other side of my heart<br/>to you. This is what I planned and decided. If I run away, even<br/>with money and a passport, and even to America, I should be cheered<br/>up by the thought that I am not running away for pleasure, not for<br/>happiness, but to another exile as bad, perhaps, as Siberia. It is<br/>as bad, Alyosha, it is! I hate that America, damn it, already. Even<br/>though Grusha will be with me. Just look at her; is she an<br/>American? She is Russian, Russian to the marrow of her bones; she<br/>will be homesick for the mother country, and I shall see every hour<br/>that she is suffering for my sake, that she has taken up that cross<br/>for me. And what harm has she done? And how shall I, too, put up<br/>with the rabble out there, though they may be better than I, every<br/>one of them? I hate that America already! And though they may be<br/>wonderful at machinery, every one of them, damn them, they are not<br/>of my soul. I love Russia, Alyosha, I love the Russian God, though<br/>I am a scoundrel myself. I shall choke there!" he exclaimed, his<br/>eyes suddenly flashing. His voice was trembling with tears. "So<br/>this is what I've decided, Alyosha, listen," he began again,<br/>mastering his emotion. "As soon as I arrive there with Grusha, we<br/>will set to work at once on the land, in solitude, somewhere very<br/>remote, with wild bears. There must be some remote parts even<br/>there. I am told there are still Redskins there, somewhere, on the<br/>edge of the horizon. So to the country of the Last of the Mohicans,<br/>and there we'll tackle the grammar at once, Grusha and I. Work and<br/>grammar- that's how we'll spend three years. And by that time we<br/>shall speak English like any Englishman. And as soon as we've<br/>learnt it- good-bye to America! We'll run here to Russia as<br/>American citizens. Don't be uneasy- we would not come to this<br/>little town. We'd hide somewhere, a long way off, in the north or<br/>in the south. I shall be changed by that time, and she will, too,<br/>in America. The doctors shall make me some sort of wart on my face-<br/>what's the use of their being so mechanical!- or else I'll put out<br/>one eye, let my beard grow a yard, and I shall turn grey, fretting<br/>for Russia. I dare say they won't recognise us. And if they do, let<br/>them send us to Siberia- I don't care. It will show it's our fate.<br/>We'll work on the land here, too, somewhere in the wilds, and I'll<br/>make up as an American all my life. But we shall die on our own<br/>soil. That's my plan, and it shan't be altered. Do you approve?"<br/>"Yes," said Alyosha, not wanting to contradict him. Mitya paused<br/>for a minute and said suddenly: "And how they worked it up at the<br/>trial! Didn't they work it up!" "If they had not, you would have<br/>been convicted just the same," said Alyosha, with a sigh. "Yes,<br/>people are sick of me here! God bless them, but it's hard," Mitya<br/>moaned miserably. Again there was silence for a minute. "Alyosha,<br/>put me out of my misery at once!" he exclaimed suddenly. "Tell me,<br/>is she coming now, or not? Tell me? What did she say? How did she<br/>say it?" "She said she would come, but I don't know whether she<br/>will come to-day. It's hard for her, you know," Alyosha looked<br/>timidly at his brother. "I should think it is hard for her!<br/>Alyosha, it will drive me out of my mind. Grusha keeps looking at<br/>me. She understands. My God, calm my heart: what is it I want? I<br/>want Katya! Do I understand what I want? It's the headstrong, evil<br/>Karamazov spirit! No, I am not fit for suffering. I am a scoundrel,<br/>that's all one can say." "Here she is!" cried Alyosha. At that<br/>instant Katya appeared in the doorway. For a moment she stood<br/>still, gazing at Mitya with a dazed expression. He leapt pulsively<br/>to his feet, and a scared look came into his face. He turned pale,<br/>but a timid, pleading smile appeared on his lips at once, and with<br/>an irresistible impulse he held out both hands to Katya. Seeing it,<br/>she flew impetuously to him. She seized him by the hands, and<br/>almost by force made him sit down on the bed. She sat down beside<br/>him, and still keeping his hands pressed them violently. Several<br/>times they both strove to speak, but stopped short and again gazed<br/>speechless with a strange smile, their eyes fastened on one<br/>another. So passed two minutes. "Have you forgiven me?" Mitya<br/>faltered at last, and at the same moment turning to Alyosha, his<br/>face working with joy, he cried, "Do you hear what I am asking, do<br/>you hear?" "That's what I loved you for, that you are generous at<br/>heart!" broke from Katya. "My forgiveness is no good to you, nor<br/>yours to me; whether you forgive me or not, you will always be a<br/>sore place in my heart, and I in yours- so it must be… ." She<br/>stopped to take breath. "What have I come for?" she began again<br/>with nervous haste: "to embrace your feet, to press your hands like<br/>this, till it hurts- you remember how in Moscow I used to squeeze<br/>them- to tell you again that you are my god, my joy, to tell you<br/>that I love you madly," she moaned in anguish, and suddenly pressed<br/>his hand greedily to her lips. Tears streamed from her eyes.<br/>Alyosha stood speechless and confounded; he had never expected what<br/>he was seeing. "Love is over, Mitya!" Katya began again, "But the<br/>past is painfully dear to me. Know that you will always be so. But<br/>now let what might have been come true for one minute," she<br/>faltered, with a drawn smile, looking into his face joyfully again.<br/>"You love another woman, and I love another man, and yet I shall<br/>love you for ever, and you will love me; do you know that? Do you<br/>hear? Love me, love me all your life!" she cried, with a quiver<br/>almost of menace in her voice. "I shall love you, and… do you know,<br/>Katya," Mitya began, drawing a deep breath at each word, "do you<br/>know, five days ago, that same evening, I loved you… . When you<br/>fell down and were carried out… All my life! So it will be, so it<br/>will always be-" So they murmured to one another frantic words,<br/>almost meaningless, perhaps not even true, but at that moment it<br/>was all true, and they both believed what they said implicitly.<br/>"Katya," cried Mitya suddenly, "do you believe I murdered him? I<br/>know you don't believe it now, but then… when you gave evidence… .<br/>Surely, surely you did not believe it!" "I did not believe it even<br/>then. I've never believed it. I hated you, and for a moment I<br/>persuaded myself. While I was giving evidence I persuaded myself<br/>and believed it, but when I'd finished speaking I left off<br/>believing it at once. Don't doubt that! I have forgotten that I<br/>came here to punish myself," she said, with a new expression in her<br/>voice, quite unlike the loving tones of a moment before. "Woman,<br/>yours is a heavy burden," broke, as it were, involuntarily from<br/>Mitya. "Let me go," she whispered. "I'll come again. It's more than<br/>I can bear now." She was getting up from her place, but suddenly<br/>uttered a loud scream and staggered back. Grushenka walked suddenly<br/>and noiselessly into the room. No one had expected her. Katya moved<br/>swiftly to the door, but when she reached Grushenka, she stopped<br/>suddenly, turned as white as chalk and moaned softly, almost in a<br/>whisper: "Forgive me!" Grushenka stared at her and, pausing for an<br/>instant, in a vindictive, venomous voice, answered: "We are full of<br/>hatred, my girl, you and I! We are both full of hatred! As though<br/>we could forgive one another! Save him, and I'll worship you all my<br/>life." "You won't forgive her!" cried Mitya, with frantic reproach.<br/>"Don't be anxious, I'll save him for you!" Katya whispered rapidly,<br/>and she ran out of the room. "And you could refuse to forgive her<br/>when she begged your forgiveness herself?' Mitya exclaimed bitterly<br/>again. "Mitya, don't dare to blame her; you have no right to!"<br/>Alyosha cried hotly. "Her proud lips spoke, not her heart,"<br/>Grushenka brought out in a tone of disgust. "If she saves you I'll<br/>forgive her everything-" She stopped speaking, as though<br/>suppressing something. She could not yet recover herself. She had<br/>come in, as appeared afterwards, accidentally, with no suspicion of<br/>what she would meet. "Alyosha, run after her!" Mitya cried to his<br/>brother; "tell her… I don't know… don't let her go away like this!"<br/>"I'll come to you again at nightfall," said Alyosha, and he ran<br/>after Katya. He overtook her outside the hospital grounds. She<br/>walking fast, but as soon as Alyosha caught her up she said<br/>quickly: "No, before that woman I can't punish myself! I asked her<br/>forgiveness because I wanted to punish myself to the bitter end.<br/>She would not forgive me… . I like her for that!" she added, in an<br/>unnatural voice, and her eyes flashed with fierce resentment. "My<br/>brother did not expect this in the least," muttered Alyosha. "He<br/>was sure she would not come-" "No doubt. Let us leave that," she<br/>snapped. "Listen: I can't go with you to the funeral now. I've sent<br/>them flowers. I think they still have money. If necessary, tell<br/>them I'll never abandon them… . Now leave me, leave me, please. You<br/>are late as it is- the bells are ringing for the service… . Leave<br/>me, please!"<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
