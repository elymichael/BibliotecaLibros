<br/>"Enough, dear son, enough, dear," he pronounced with feeling at<br/>last. "Why do you weep? Rejoice and weep not. Don't you know that<br/>this is the greatest of his days? Think only where he is now, at<br/>this moment!"<br/><br/>Alyosha glanced at him, uncovering his face, which was swollen<br/>with crying like a child's, but turned away at once without<br/>uttering a word and hid his face in his hands again.<br/><br/>"Maybe it is well," said Father Paissy thoughtfully; "weep if<br/>you must; Christ has sent you those tears."<br/><br/>"Your touching tears are but a relief to your spirit and will<br/>serve to gladden your dear heart," he added to himself, walking<br/>away from Alyosha, and thinking lovingly of him. He moved away<br/>quickly, however, for he felt that he too might weep looking at<br/>him.<br/><br/>Meanwhile the time was passing; the monastery services and the<br/>requiems for the dead followed in their due course. Father Paissy<br/>again took Father Iosif's place by the coffin and began reading the<br/>Gospel. But before three o'clock in the afternoon that something<br/>took place to which I alluded at the end of the last book,<br/>something so unexpected by all of us and so contrary to the general<br/>hope, that, I repeat, this trivial incident has been minutely<br/>remembered to this day in our town and all the surrounding<br/>neighbourhood. I may add here, for myself personally, that I feel<br/>it almost repulsive that event which caused such frivolous<br/>agitation and was such a stumbling-block to many, though in reality<br/>it was the most natural and trivial matter. I should, of course,<br/>have omitted all mention of it in my story, if it had not exerted a<br/>very strong influence on the heart and soul of the chief, though<br/>future, hero of my story, Alyosha, forming a crisis and<br/>turning-point in his spiritual development, giving a shock to his<br/>intellect, which finally strengthened it for the rest of his life<br/>and gave it a definite aim.<br/><br/>And so, to return to our story. When before dawn they laid<br/>Father Zossima's body in the coffin and brought it into the front<br/>room, the question of opening the windows was raised among those<br/>who were around the coffin. But this suggestion made casually by<br/>someone was unanswered and almost unnoticed. Some of those present<br/>may perhaps have inwardly noticed it, only to reflect that the<br/>anticipation of decay and corruption from the body of such a saint<br/>was an actual absurdity, calling for compassion (if not a smile)<br/>for the lack of faith and the frivolity it implied. For they<br/>expected something quite different.<br/><br/>And, behold, soon after midday there were signs of something, at<br/>first only observed in silence by those who came in and out and<br/>were evidently each afraid to communicate the thought in his mind.<br/>But by three o'clock those signs had become so clear and<br/>unmistakable, that the news swiftly reached all the monks and<br/>visitors in the hermitage, promptly penetrated to the monastery,<br/>throwing all the monks into amazement, and finally, in the shortest<br/>possible time, spread to the town, exciting everyone in it,<br/>believers and unbelievers alike. The unbelievers rejoiced, and as<br/>for the believers some of them rejoiced even more than the<br/>unbelievers, for "men love the downfall and disgrace of the<br/>righteous," as the deceased elder had said in one of his<br/>exhortations.<br/><br/>The fact is that a smell of decomposition began to come from the<br/>coffin, growing gradually more marked, and by three o'clock it was<br/>quite unmistakable. In all the past history of our monastery, no<br/>such scandal could be recalled, and in no other circumstances could<br/>such a scandal have been possible, as showed itself in unseemly<br/>disorder immediately after this discovery among the very monks<br/>themselves. Afterwards, even many years afterwards, some sensible<br/>monks were amazed and horrified, when they recalled that day, that<br/>the scandal could have reached such proportions. For in the past,<br/>monks of very holy life had died, God-fearing old men, whose<br/>saintliness was acknowledged by all, yet from their humble coffins,<br/>too, the breath of corruption had come, naturally, as from all dead<br/>bodies, but that had caused no scandal nor even the slightest<br/>excitement. Of course, there had been, in former times, saints in<br/>the monastery whose memory was carefully preserved and whose<br/>relics, according to tradition, showed no signs of corruption. This<br/>fact was regarded by the monks as touching and mysterious, and the<br/>tradition of it was cherished as something blessed and miraculous,<br/>and as a promise, by God's grace, of still greater glory from their<br/>tombs in the future.<br/><br/>One such, whose memory was particularly cherished, was an old<br/>monk, Job, who had died seventy years before at the age of a<br/>hundred and five. He had been a celebrated ascetic, rigid in<br/>fasting and silence, and his tomb was pointed out to all visitors<br/>on their arrival with peculiar respect and mysterious hints of<br/>great hopes connected with it. (That was the very tomb on which<br/>Father Paissy had found Alyosha sitting in the morning.) Another<br/>memory cherished in the monastery was that of the famous Father<br/>Varsonofy, who was only recently dead and had preceded Father<br/>Zossima in the eldership. He was reverenced during his lifetime as<br/>a crazy saint by all the pilgrims to the monastery. There was a<br/>tradition that both of these had lain in their coffins as though<br/>alive, that they had shown no signs of decomposition when they were<br/>buried and that there had been a holy light in their faces. And<br/>some people even insisted that a sweet fragrance came from their<br/>bodies.<br/><br/>Yet, in spite of these edifying memories, it would be difficult<br/>to explain the frivolity, absurdity and malice that were manifested<br/>beside the coffin of Father Zossima. It is my private opinion that<br/>several different causes were simultaneously at work, one of which<br/>was the deeply rooted hostility to the institution of elders as a<br/>pernicious innovation, an antipathy hidden deep in the hearts of<br/>many of the monks. Even more powerful was jealousy of the dead<br/>man's saintliness, so firmly established during lifetime that it<br/>was almost a forbidden thing to question it. For though the late<br/>elder had won over many hearts, more by love than by miracles, and<br/>had gathered round him a mass of loving adherents, none the less,<br/>in fact, rather the more on that account he had awakened jealousy<br/>and so had come to have bitter enemies, secret and open, not only<br/>in the monastery but in the world outside it. He did no one any<br/>harm, but "Why do they think him so saintly?" And that question<br/>alone, gradually repeated, gave rise at last to an intense,<br/>insatiable hatred of him. That, I believe, was why many people were<br/>extremely delighted at the smell of decomposition which came so<br/>quickly, for not a day had passed since his death. At the same time<br/>there were some among those who had been hitherto reverently<br/>devoted to the elder, who were almost mortified and personally<br/>affronted by this incident. This was how the thing happened.<br/><br/>
