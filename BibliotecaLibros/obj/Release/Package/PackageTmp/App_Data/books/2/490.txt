"You've said so to yourself many times, when you've been alone
during these two dreadful months," Alyosha went on softly and
distinctly as before. Yet he was speaking now, as it were, not of
himself, not of his own will, but obeying some irresistible
command. "You have accused yourself and have confessed to yourself
that you are the murderer and no one else. But you didn't do it:
you are mistaken: you are not the murderer. Do you hear? It was not
you! God has sent me to tell you so."

They were both silent. The silence lasted a whole long minute.
They were both standing still, gazing into each other's eyes. They
were both pale. Suddenly Ivan began trembling all over, and
clutched Alyosha's shoulder.

"You've been in my room!" he whispered hoarsely. "You've been
there at night, when he came… . Confess… have you seen him, have
you seen him?"

"Whom do you mean- Mitya?" Alyosha asked, bewildered.

"Not him, damn the monster!" Ivan shouted, in a frenzy, "Do you
know that he visits me? How did you find out? Speak!"

"Who is he? I don't know whom you are talking about," Alyosha
faltered, beginning to be alarmed.

"Yes, you do know. or how could you-&#160;? It's impossible that
you don't know."

Suddenly he seemed to check himself. He stood still and seemed
to reflect. A strange grin contorted his lips.

"Brother," Alyosha began again, in a shaking voice, "I have said
this to you, because you'll believe my word, I know that. I tell
you once and for all, it's not you. You hear, once for all! God has
put it into my heart to say this to you, even though it may make
you hate me from this hour."

But by now Ivan had apparently regained his self-control.
