"Have you told it in confession?"<br/><br/>"I have confessed it. Twice I have confessed it."<br/><br/>"Have you been admitted to Communion?"<br/><br/>"Yes. I am afraid. I am afraid to die."<br/><br/>"Fear nothing and never be afraid; and don't fret. If only your<br/>penitence fail not, God will forgive all. There is no sin, and<br/>there can be no sin on all the earth, which the Lord will not<br/>forgive to the truly repentant! Man cannot commit a sin so great as<br/>to exhaust the infinite love of God. Can there be a sin which could<br/>exceed the love of God? Think only of repentance, continual<br/>repentance, but dismiss fear altogether. Believe that God loves you<br/>as you cannot conceive; that He loves you with your sin, in your<br/>sin. It has been said of old that over one repentant sinner there<br/>is more joy in heaven than over ten righteous men. Go, and fear<br/>not. Be not bitter against men. Be not angry if you are wronged.<br/>Forgive the dead man in your heart what wrong he did you. Be<br/>reconciled with him in truth. If you are penitent, you love. And if<br/>you love you are of God. All things are atoned for, all things are<br/>saved by love. If I, a sinner, even as you are, am tender with you<br/>and have pity on you, how much more will God. Love is such a<br/>priceless treasure that you can redeem the whole world by it, and<br/>expiate not only your own sins but the sins of others."<br/><br/>He signed her three times with the cross, took from his own neck<br/>a little ikon and put it upon her. She bowed down to the earth<br/>without speaking.<br/><br/>He got up and looked cheerfully at a healthy peasant woman with<br/>a tiny baby in her arms.<br/><br/>"From Vyshegorye, dear Father."<br/><br/>"Five miles you have dragged yourself with the baby. What do you<br/>want?"<br/><br/>"I've come to look at you. I have been to you before- or have<br/>you forgotten? You've no great memory if you've forgotten me. They<br/>told us you were ill. Thinks I, I'll go and see him for myself. Now<br/>I see you, and you're not ill! You'll live another twenty years.<br/>God bless you! There are plenty to pray for you; how should you be<br/>ill?"<br/><br/>"I thank you for all, daughter."<br/>
