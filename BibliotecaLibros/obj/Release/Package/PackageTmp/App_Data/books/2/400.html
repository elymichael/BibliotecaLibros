Further examination elicited that Grushenka knew, too,<br/>where that money had come from, and that Dmitri Fyodorovitch had<br/>got it from Katerina Ivanovna.<br/><br/>"And did you never, once, hear that the money spent a month ago<br/>was not three thousand, but less, and that Dmitri Fyodorovitch had<br/>saved half that sum for his own use?"<br/><br/>"No, I never heard that," answered Grushenka.<br/><br/>It was explained further that Mitya had, on the contrary, often<br/>told her that he hadn't a farthing.<br/><br/>"He was always expecting to get some from his father," said<br/>Grushenka in conclusion.<br/><br/>"Did he never say before youâ€¦ casually, or in a moment of<br/>irritation," Nikolay Parfenovitch put in suddenly, "that he<br/>intended to make an attempt on his father's life?"<br/><br/>"Ach, he did say so," sighed Grushenka.<br/><br/>"Once or several times?"<br/><br/>"He mentioned it several times, always in anger."<br/><br/>
