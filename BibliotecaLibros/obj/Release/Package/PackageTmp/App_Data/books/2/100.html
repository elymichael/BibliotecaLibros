"Alyosha," he whispered apprehensively, "where's Ivan?"<br/><br/>"In the yard. He's got a headache. He's on the watch."<br/><br/>"Give me that looking-glass. It stands over there. Give it<br/>me."<br/><br/>Alyosha gave him a little round folding looking-glass which<br/>stood on the chest of drawers. The old man looked at himself in it;<br/>his nose was considerably swollen, and on the left side of his<br/>forehead there was a rather large crimson bruise.<br/><br/>"What does Ivan say? Alyosha, my dear, my only son, I'm afraid<br/>of Ivan. I'm more afraid of Ivan than the other. You're the only<br/>one I'm not afraid ofâ€¦ ."<br/><br/>"Don't be afraid of Ivan either. He is angry, but he'll defend<br/>you."<br/><br/>"Alyosha, and what of the other? He's run to Grushenka. My<br/>angel, tell me the truth, was she here just now or not?"<br/><br/>"No one has seen her. It was a mistake. She has not been<br/>here."<br/><br/>"You know Mitya wants to marry her, to marry her."<br/><br/>"She won't marry him."<br/><br/>"She won't. She won't. She won't. She won't on any account!"<br/>
