"Yes, that's purely Russian," said Alyosha smiling.<br/><br/>"Your words are worth a gold piece, O ass, and I'll give it to<br/>you to-day. But as to the rest you talk nonsense, nonsense,<br/>nonsense. Let me tell you, stupid, that we here are all of little<br/>faith, only from carelessness, because we haven't time; things are<br/>too much for us, and, in the second place, the Lord God has given<br/>us so little time, only twenty-four hours in the day, so that one<br/>hasn't even time to get sleep enough, much less to repent of one's<br/>sins. While you have denied your faith to your enemies when you'd<br/>nothing else to think about but to show your faith! So I consider,<br/>brother, that it constitutes a sin."<br/><br/>"Constitute a sin it may, but consider yourself, Grigory<br/>Vassilyevitch, that it only extenuates it, if it does constitute.<br/>If I had believed then in very truth, as I ought to have believed,<br/>then it really would have been sinful if I had not faced tortures<br/>for my faith, and had gone over to the pagan Mohammedan faith. But,<br/>of course, it wouldn't have come to torture then, because I should<br/>only have had to say at that instant to the mountain, 'Move and<br/>crush the tormentor,' and it would have moved and at the very<br/>instant have crushed him like a black-beetle, and I should have<br/>walked away as though nothing had happened, praising and glorifying<br/>God. But, suppose at that very moment I had tried all that, and<br/>cried to that mountain, 'Crush these tormentors,' and it hadn't<br/>crushed them, how could I have helped doubting, pray, at such a<br/>time, and at such a dread hour of mortal terror? And apart from<br/>that, I should know already that I could not attain to the fullness<br/>of the Kingdom of Heaven (for since the mountain had not moved at<br/>my word, they could not think very much of my faith up aloft, and<br/>there could be no very great reward awaiting me in the world to<br/>come). So why should I let them flay the skin off me as well, and<br/>to no good purpose? For, even though they had flayed my skin half<br/>off my back, even then the mountain would not have moved at my word<br/>or at my cry. And at such a moment not only doubt might come over<br/>one but one might lose one's reason from fear, so that one would<br/>not be able to think at all. And, therefore, how should I be<br/>particularly to blame if not seeing my advantage or reward there or<br/>here, I should, at least, save my skin. And so trusting fully in<br/>the grace of the Lord I should cherish the hope that I might be<br/>altogether forgiven."<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
