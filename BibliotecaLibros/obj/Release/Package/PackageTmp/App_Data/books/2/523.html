Ivan took out the notes and showed them to him. Smerdyakov<br/>looked at them for ten seconds.<br/><br/>"Well, you can go," he said, with a wave of his hand. "Ivan<br/>Fyodorovitch!" he called after him again.<br/><br/>"What do you want?" Ivan turned without stopping.<br/><br/>"Good-bye!"<br/><br/>"Till to-morrow!" Ivan cried again, and he walked out of the<br/>cottage.<br/><br/>The snowstorm was still raging. He walked the first few steps<br/>boldly, but suddenly began staggering. "It's something physical,"<br/>he thought with a grin. Something like joy was springing up in his<br/>heart. He was conscious of unbounded resolution; he would make an<br/>end of the wavering that had so tortured him of late. His<br/>determination was taken, "and now it will not be changed," he<br/>thought with relief. At that moment he stumbled against something<br/>and almost fell down. Stopping short, he made out at his feet the<br/>peasant he had knocked down, still lying senseless and motionless.<br/>The snow had almost covered his face. Ivan seized him and lifted<br/>him in his arms. Seeing a light in the little house to the right he<br/>went up, knocked at the shutters, and asked the man to whom the<br/>house belonged to help him carry the peasant to the police station,<br/>promising him three roubles. The man got ready and came out. I<br/>won't describe in detail how Ivan succeeded in his object, bringing<br/>the peasant to the police-station and arranging for a doctor to see<br/>him at once, providing with a liberal hand for the expenses. I will<br/>only say that this business took a whole hour, but Ivan was well<br/>content with it. His mind wandered and worked incessantly.<br/><br/>"If I had not taken my decision so firmly for to-morrow," he<br/>reflected with satisfaction, "I should not have stayed a whole hour<br/>to look after the peasant, but should have passed by, without<br/>caring about his being frozen. I am quite capable of watching<br/>myself, by the way," he thought at the same instant, with still<br/>greater satisfaction, "although they have decided that I am going<br/>out of my mind!"<br/><br/>Just as he reached his own house he stopped short, asking<br/>himself suddenly hadn't he better go at once to the prosecutor and<br/>tell him everything. He decided the question by turning back to the<br/>house. "Everything together to-morrow!" he whispered to himself,<br/>and, strange to say, almost all his gladness and selfsatisfaction<br/>passed in one instant.<br/><br/>As he entered his own room he felt something like a touch of ice<br/>on his heart, like a recollection or, more exactly, a reminder, of<br/>something agonising and revolting that was in that room now, at<br/>that moment, and had been there before. He sank wearily on his<br/>sofa. The old woman brought him a samovar; he made tea, but did not<br/>touch it. He sat on the sofa and felt giddy. He felt that he was<br/>ill and helpless. He was beginning to drop asleep, but got up<br/>uneasily and walked across the room to shake off his drowsiness. At<br/>moments he fancied he was delirious, but it was not illness that he<br/>thought of most. Sitting down again, he began looking round, as<br/>though searching for something. This happened several times. At<br/>last his eyes were fastened intently on one point. Ivan smiled, but<br/>an angry flush suffused his face. He sat a long time in his place,<br/>his head propped on both arms, though he looked sideways at the<br/>same point, at the sofa that stood against the opposite wall. There<br/>was evidently something, some object, that irritated him there,<br/>worried him and tormented him.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
