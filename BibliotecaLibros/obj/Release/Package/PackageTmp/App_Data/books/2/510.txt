It was over-heated as before, but there were changes in the
room. One of the benches at the side had been removed, and in its
place had been put a large old mahogany leather sofa, on which a
bed had been made up, with fairly clean white pillows. Smerdyakov
was sitting on the sofa, wearing the same dressing-gown. The table
had been brought out in front of the sofa, so that there was hardly
room to move. On the table lay a thick book in yellow cover, but
Smerdyakov was not reading it. He seemed to be sitting doing
nothing. He met Ivan with a slow silent gaze, and was apparently
not at all surprised at his coming. There was a great change in his
face; he was much thinner and sallower. His eyes were sunken and
there were blue marks under them.

"Why, you really are ill?" Ivan stopped short. "I won't keep you
long, I wont even take off my coat. Where can one sit down?"

He went to the other end of the table, moved up a chair and sat
down on it.

"Why do you look at me without speaking? We only come with one
question, and I swear I won't go without an answer. Has the young
lady, Katerina Ivanovna, been with you?"

Smerdyakov still remained silent, looking quietly at Ivan as
before. Suddenly, with a motion of his hand, he turned his face
away.

"What's the matter with you?" cried Ivan.

"Nothing."

"What do you mean by 'nothing'?"

"Yes, she has. It's no matter to you. Let me alone."

"No, I won't let you alone. Tell me, when was she here?"
