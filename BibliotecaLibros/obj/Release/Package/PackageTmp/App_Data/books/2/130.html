<br/>"He even throws stones with his left hand," observed a<br/>third.<br/><br/>At that instant a stone flew into the group, but only just<br/>grazed the left-handed boy, though it was well and vigorously<br/>thrown by the boy standing on the other side of the ditch.<br/><br/>"Give it him, hit him back, Smurov," they all shouted. But<br/>Smurov, the left-handed boy, needed no telling, and at once<br/>revenged himself; he threw a stone, but it missed the boy and hit<br/>the ground. The boy on the other side of the ditch, the pocket of<br/>whose coat was visibly bulging with stones, flung another stone at<br/>the group; this time it flew straight at Alyosha and hit him<br/>painfully on the shoulder.<br/><br/>"He aimed it at you, he meant it for you. You are Karamazov,<br/>Karamazov!" the boys shouted laughing, "Come, all throw at him at<br/>once!" and six stones flew at the boy. One struck the boy on the<br/>head and he fell down, but at once leapt up and began ferociously<br/>returning their fire. Both sides threw stones incessantly. Many of<br/>the group had their pockets full too.<br/><br/>"What are you about! Aren't you ashamed? Six against one! Why,<br/>you'll kill him," cried Alyosha.<br/><br/>He ran forward and met the flying stones to screen the solitary<br/>boy. Three or four ceased throwing for a minute.<br/><br/>"He began first!" cried a boy in a red shirt in an angry<br/>childish voice. "He is a beast, he stabbed Krassotkin in class the<br/>other day with a penknife. It bled. Krassotkin wouldn't tell tales,<br/>but he must be thrashed."<br/><br/>"But what for? I suppose you tease him."<br/><br/>"There, he sent a stone in your back again, he knows you," cried<br/>the children. "It's you he is throwing at now, not us. Come, all of<br/>you, at him again, don't miss, Smurov!" and again a fire of stones,<br/>and a very vicious one, began. The boy on the other side of the<br/>ditch was hit in the chest; he screamed, began to cry and ran away<br/>uphill towards Mihailovsky Street. They all shouted: "Aha, he is<br/>funking, he is running away. Wisp of tow!"<br/><br/>"You don't know what a beast he is, Karamazov, killing is too<br/>good for him," said the boy in the jacket, with flashing eyes. He<br/>seemed to be the eldest.<br/><br/>
