"Murder! then he tried to murder you, too?"

"Why, has he killed somebody else?" Madame Hohlakov asked
impulsively.

"If you would kindly listen, madam, for half a moment, I'll
explain it all in a couple of words," answered Perhotin, firmly.
"At five o'clock this afternoon Dmitri Fyodorovitch borrowed ten
roubles from me, and I know for a fact he had no money. Yet at nine
o'clock, he came to see me with a bundle of hundred-rouble notes in
his hand, about two or three thousand roubles. His hands and face
were all covered with blood, and he looked like a madman. When I
asked him where he had got so much money, he answered that he had
just received it from you, that you had given him a sum of three
thousand to go to the gold mines… "

Madame Hohlakov's face assumed an expression of intense and
painful excitement.

"Good God! He must have killed his old father!" she cried,
clasping her hands. "I have never given him money, never! Oh, run,
run!… Don't say another word Save the old man… run to his father…
run!"

"Excuse me, madam, then you did not give him money? You remember
for a fact that you did not give him any money?"

"No, I didn't, I didn't! I refused to give it him, for he could
not appreciate it. He ran out in a fury, stamping. He rushed at me,
but I slipped away… . And let me tell you, as I wish to hide
nothing from you now, that he positively spat at me. Can you fancy
that! But why are we standing? Ah, sit down."

"Excuse me, I… "

"Or better run, run, you must run and save the poor old man from
an awful death!"

"But if he has killed him already?"

"Ah, good heavens, yes! Then what are we to do now? What do you
think we must do now?"
