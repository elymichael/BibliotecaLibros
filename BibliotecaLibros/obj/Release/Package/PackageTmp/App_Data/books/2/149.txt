"As God's above, it's involuntary, and I usen't to use it! I
didn't use the word 'sir' all my life, but as soon as I sank into
low water I began to say 'sir.' It's the work of a higher power. I
see you are interested in contemporary questions, but how can I
have excited your curiosity, living as I do in surroundings
impossible for the exercise of hospitality?"

"I've come- about that business."

"About what business?" the captain interrupted impatiently.

"About your meeting with my brother Dmitri Fyodorovitch,"
Alyosha blurted out awkwardly.

"What meeting, sir? You don't mean that meeting? About my 'wisp
of tow,' then?" He moved closer so that his knees positively
knocked against Alyosha. His lips were strangely compressed like a
thread.

"What wisp of tow?" muttered Alyosha.

"He is come to complain of me, father!" cried a voice familiar
to Alyosha- the voice of the schoolboy- from behind the curtain. "I
bit his finger just now." The curtain was pulled, and Alyosha saw
his assailant lying on a little bed made up on the bench and the
chair in the corner under the ikons. The boy lay covered by his
coat and an old wadded quilt. He was evidently unwell, and, judging
by his glittering eyes, he was in a fever. He looked at Alyosha
without fear, as though he felt he was at home and could not be
touched.

"What! Did he bite your finger?" The captain jumped up from his
chair. "Was it your finger he bit?"

"Yes. He was throwing stones with other schoolboys. There were
six of them against him alone. I went up to him, and he threw a
stone at me and then another at my head. I asked him what I had
done to him. And then he rushed at me and bit my finger badly, I
don't know why."

"I'll thrash him, sir, at once- this minute!" The captain jumped
up from his seat.

"But I am not complaining at all, I am simply telling youâ€¦ . I
don't want him to be thrashed. Besides, he seems to be ill."
