"He's slipped away."

Ivan raised his head and smiled softly.

"He was afraid of you, of a dove like you. You are a 'pure
cherub.' Dmitri calls you a cherub. Cherub!… the thunderous rapture
of the seraphim. What are seraphim? Perhaps a whole constellation.
But perhaps that constellation is only a chemical molecule. There's
a constellation of the Lion and the Sun. Don't you know it?"

"Brother, sit down," said Alyosha in alarm. "For goodness' sake,
sit down on the sofa! You are delirious; put your head on the
pillow, that's right. Would you like a wet towel on your head?
Perhaps it will do you good."

"Give me the towel: it's here on the chair. I just threw it down
there."

"It's not here. Don't worry yourself. I know where it is- here,"
said Alyosha, finding a clean towel, folded up and unused, by
Ivan's dressing-table in the other corner of the room. Ivan looked
strangely at the towel: recollection seemed to come back to him for
an instant.

"Stay"- he got up from the sofa- "an hour ago I took that new
towel from there and wetted it. I wrapped it round my head and
threw it down here… How is it it's dry? There was no other."

"You put that towel on your head?" asked Alyosha.

"Yes, and walked up and down the room an hour ago… Why have the
candles burnt down so? What's the time?"

"Nearly twelve"
