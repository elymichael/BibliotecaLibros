<br/>"Judge us together!" Grushenka cried frantically, still<br/>kneeling. "Punish us together. I will go with him now, if it's to<br/>death!"<br/><br/>"Grusha, my life, my blood, my holy one!" Mitya fell on his<br/>knees beside her and held her tight in his arms. "Don't believe<br/>her," he cried, "she's not guilty of anything, of any blood, of<br/>anything!"<br/><br/>He remembered afterwards that he was forcibly dragged away from<br/>her by several men, and that she was led out, and that when he<br/>recovered himself he was sitting at the table. Beside him and<br/>behind him stood the men with metal plates. Facing him on the other<br/>side of the table sat Nikolay Parfenovitch, the investigating<br/>lawyer. He kept persuading him to drink a little water out of a<br/>glass that stood on the table.<br/><br/>"That will refresh you, that will calm you. Be calm, don't be<br/>frightened," he added, extremely politely. Mitya (he remembered it<br/>afterwards) became suddenly intensely interested in his big rings,<br/>one with an amethyst, and another with a transparent bright yellow<br/>stone, of great brilliance. And long afterwards he remembered with<br/>wonder how those rings had riveted his attention through all those<br/>terrible hours of interrogation, so that he was utterly unable to<br/>tear himself away from them and dismiss them, as things that had<br/>nothing to do with his position. On Mitya's left side, in the place<br/>where Maximov had been sitting at the beginning of the evening, the<br/>prosecutor was now seated, and on Mitya's right hand, where<br/>Grushenka had been, was a rosy-cheeked young man in a sort of<br/>shabby hunting-jacket, with ink and paper before him. This was the<br/>secretary of the investigating lawyer, who had brought him with<br/>him. The police captain was now standing by the window at the other<br/>end of the room, beside Kalganov, who was sitting there.<br/><br/>"Drink some water," said the investigating lawyer softly, for<br/>the tenth time.<br/><br/>"I have drunk it, gentlemen, I have… but come gentlemen, crush<br/>me, punish me, decide my fate!" cried Mitya, staring with terribly<br/>fixed wide-open eyes at the investigating lawyer.<br/><br/>"So you positively declare that you are not guilty of the death<br/>of your father, Fyodor Pavlovitch?" asked the investigating lawyer,<br/>softly but insistently.<br/><br/>"I am not guilty. I am guilty of the blood of another old man,<br/>but not of my father's. And I weep for it! I killed, I killed the<br/>old man and knocked him down… . But it's hard to have to answer for<br/>that murder with another, a terrible murder of which I am not<br/>guilty… .It's a terrible accusation, gentlemen, a knockdown blow.<br/>But who has killed my father, who has killed him? Who can have<br/>killed him if I didn't? It's marvellous, extraordinary,<br/>impossible."<br/><br/>"Yes, who can have killed him?" the investigating lawyer was<br/>beginning, but Ippolit Kirillovitch, the prosecutor, glancing at<br/>him, addressed Mitya.<br/><br/>"You need not worry yourself about the old servant, Grigory<br/>Vasilyevitch. He is alive, he has recovered, and in spite of the<br/>terrible blows inflicted, according to his own and your evidence,<br/>by you, there seems no doubt that he will live, so the doctor says,<br/>at least."<br/><br/>
