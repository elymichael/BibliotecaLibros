<br/>Madame Hohlakov warmly entreated Alyosha to report this new<br/>"miracle of prediction" to the Superior and all the brotherhood.<br/>"All, all, ought to know of it" she concluded. The letter had been<br/>written in haste, the excitement of the writer was apparent in<br/>every line of it. But Alyosha had no need to tell the monks, for<br/>all knew of it already. Rakitin had commissioned the monk who<br/>brought his message "to inform most respectfully his reverence<br/>Father Paissy, that he, Rakitin, has a matter to speak of with him,<br/>of such gravity that he dare not defer it for a moment, and humbly<br/>begs forgiveness for his presumption." As the monk had given the<br/>message to Father Paissy, before that to Alyosha, the latter found<br/>after reading the letter, there was nothing left for him to do but<br/>to hand it to Father Paissy in confirmation of the story.<br/><br/>And even that austere and cautious man, though he frowned as he<br/>read the news of the "miracle," could not completely restrain some<br/>inner emotion. His eyes gleamed, and a grave and solemn smile came<br/>into his lips.<br/><br/>"We shall see greater things!" broke from him.<br/><br/>"We shall see greater things, greater things yet!" the monks<br/>around repeated.<br/><br/>But Father Paissy, frowning again, begged all of them, at least<br/>for a time, not to speak of the matter "till it be more fully<br/>confirmed, seeing there is so much credulity among those of this<br/>world, and indeed this might well have chanced naturally," he<br/>added, prudently, as it were to satisfy his conscience, though<br/>scarcely believing his own disavowal, a fact his listeners very<br/>clearly perceived.<br/><br/>Within the hour the "miracle" was of course known to the whole<br/>monastery, and many visitors who had come for the mass. No one<br/>seemed more impressed by it than the monk who had come the day<br/>before from St. Sylvester, from the little monastery of Obdorsk in<br/>the far North. It was he who had been standing near Madame Hohlakov<br/>the previous day and had asked Father Zossima earnestly, referring<br/>to the "healing" of the lady's daughter, "How can you presume to do<br/>such things?"<br/><br/>He was now somewhat puzzled and did not know whom to believe.<br/>The evening before he had visited Father Ferapont in his cell<br/>apart, behind the apiary, and had been greatly impressed and<br/>overawed by the visit. This Father Ferapont was that aged monk so<br/>devout in fasting and observing silence who has been mentioned<br/>already, as antagonistic to Father Zossima and the whole<br/>institution of "elders," which he regarded as a pernicious and<br/>frivolous innovation. He was a very formidable opponent, although<br/>from his practice of silence he scarcely spoke a word to anyone.<br/>What made him formidable was that a number of monks fully shared<br/>his feeling, and many of the visitors looked upon him as a great<br/>saint and ascetic, although they had no doubt that he was crazy.<br/>But it was just his craziness attracted them.<br/><br/>Father Ferapont never went to see the elder. Though he lived in<br/>the hermitage they did not worry him to keep its regulations, and<br/>this too because he behaved as though he were crazy. He was<br/>seventy-five or more, and he lived in a corner beyond the apiary in<br/>an old decaying wooden cell which had been built long ago for<br/>another great ascetic, Father Iona, who had lived to be a hundred<br/>and five, and of whose saintly doings many curious stories were<br/>still extant in the monastery and the neighbourhood.<br/><br/>Father Ferapont had succeeded in getting himself installed in<br/>this same solitary cell seven years previously. It was simply a<br/>peasant's hut, though it looked like a chapel, for it contained an<br/>extraordinary number of ikons with lamps perpetually burning before<br/>them- which men brought to the monastery as offerings to God.<br/>Father Ferapont had been appointed to look after them and keep the<br/>lamps burning. It was said (and indeed it was true) that he ate<br/>only two pounds of bread in three days. The beekeeper, who lived<br/>close by the apiary, used to bring him the bread every three days,<br/>and even to this man who waited upon him, Father Ferapont rarely<br/>uttered a word. The four pounds of bread, together with the<br/>sacrament bread, regularly sent him on Sundays after the late mass<br/>by the Father Superior, made up his weekly rations. The water in<br/>his jug was changed every day. He rarely appeared at mass. Visitors<br/>who came to do him homage saw him sometimes kneeling all day long<br/>at prayer without looking round. If he addressed them, he was<br/>brief, abrupt, strange, and almost always rude. On very rare<br/>occasions, however, he would talk to visitors, but for the most<br/>part he would utter some one strange saying which was a complete<br/>riddle, and no entreaties would induce him to pronounce a word in<br/>explanation. He was not a priest, but a simple monk. There was a<br/>strange belief, chiefly, however, among the most ignorant, that<br/>Father Ferapont had communication with heavenly spirits and would<br/>only converse with them, and so was silent with men.<br/><br/>The monk from Obdorsk, having been directed to the apiary by the<br/>beekeeper, who was also a very silent and surly monk, went to the<br/>corner where Father Ferapont's cell stood. "Maybe he will speak as<br/>you are a stranger and maybe you'll get nothing out of him," the<br/>beekeeper had warned him. The monk, as he related afterwards,<br/>approached in the utmost apprehension. It was rather late in the<br/>evening. Father Ferapont was sitting at the door of his cell on a<br/>low bench. A huge old elm was lightly rustling overhead. There was<br/>an evening freshness in the air. The monk from Obdorsk bowed down<br/>before the saint and asked his blessing.<br/><br/>
