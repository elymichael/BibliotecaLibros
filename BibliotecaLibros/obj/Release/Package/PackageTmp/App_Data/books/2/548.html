<br/>"But it was not with his fist," cried Alyosha; "he pointed with<br/>his fingers and pointed here, very high up… . How could I have so<br/>completely forgotten it till this moment?"<br/><br/>The President asked Mitya what he had to say to the last<br/>witness's evidence. Mitya confirmed it, saying that he had been<br/>pointing to the fifteen hundred roubles which were on his breast,<br/>just below the neck, and that that was, of course, the disgrace, "A<br/>disgrace I cannot deny, the most shameful act of my whole life,"<br/>cried Mitya. "I might have repaid it and didn't repay it. I<br/>preferred to remain a thief in her eyes rather than give it back.<br/>And the most shameful part of it was that I knew beforehand I<br/>shouldn't give it back! You are right, Alyosha! Thanks,<br/>Alyosha!"<br/><br/>So Alyosha's cross-examination ended. What was important and<br/>striking about it was that one fact at least had been found, and<br/>even though this were only one tiny bit of evidence, a mere hint at<br/>evidence, it did go some little way towards proving that the bag<br/>had existed and had contained fifteen hundred roubles and that the<br/>prisoner had not been lying at the preliminary inquiry when he<br/>alleged at Mokroe that those fifteen hundred roubles were "his<br/>own." Alyosha was glad. With a flushed face he moved away to the<br/>seat assigned to him. He kept repeating to himself: "How was it I<br/>forgot? How could I have forgotten it? And what made it come back<br/>to me now?"<br/><br/>Katerina Ivanovna was called to the witness-box. As she entered<br/>something extraordinary happened in the court. The ladies clutched<br/>their lorgnettes and opera-glasses. There was a stir among the men:<br/>some stood up to get a better view. Everybody alleged afterwards<br/>that Mitya had turned "white as a sheet" on her entrance. All in<br/>black, she advanced modestly, almost timidly. It was impossible to<br/>tell from her face that she was agitated; but there was a resolute<br/>gleam in her dark and gloomy eyes. I may remark that many people<br/>mentioned that she looked particularly handsome at that moment. She<br/>spoke softly but clearly, so that she was heard all over the court.<br/>She expressed herself with composure, or at least tried to appear<br/>composed. The President began his examination discreetly and very<br/>respectfully, as though afraid to touch on "certain chords," and<br/>showing consideration for her great unhappiness. But in answer to<br/>one of the first questions Katerina Ivanovna replied firmly that<br/>she had been formerly betrothed to the prisoner, "until he left me<br/>of his own accord… " she added quietly. When they asked her about<br/>the three thousand she had entrusted to Mitya to post to her<br/>relations, she said firmly, "I didn't give him the money simply to<br/>send it off. I felt at the time that he was in great need of money…<br/>. I gave him the three thousand on the understanding that he should<br/>post it within the month if he cared to. There was no need for him<br/>to worry himself about that debt afterwards."<br/><br/>I will not repeat all the questions asked her and all her<br/>answers in detail. I will only give the substance of her<br/>evidence.<br/><br/>"I was firmly convinced that he would send off that sum as soon<br/>as he got money from his father," she went on. "I have never<br/>doubted his disinterestedness and his honesty… his scrupulous<br/>honesty… in money matters. He felt quite certain that he would<br/>receive the money from his father, and spoke to me several times<br/>about it. I knew he had a feud with his father and have always<br/>believed that he had been unfairly treated by his father. I don't<br/>remember any threat uttered by him against his father. He certainly<br/>never uttered any such threat before me. If he had come to me at<br/>that time, I should have at once relieved his anxiety about that<br/>unlucky three thousand roubles, but he had given up coming to see<br/>me… and I myself was put in such a position… that I could not<br/>invite him… . And I had no right, indeed, to be exacting as to that<br/>money, she added suddenly, and there was a ring of resolution in<br/>her voice. "I was once indebted to him for assistance in money for<br/>more than three thousand, and I took it, although I could not at<br/>that time foresee that I should ever be in a position to repay my<br/>debt."<br/><br/>There was a note of defiance in her voice. It was then<br/>Fetyukovitch began his cross-examination.<br/><br/>"Did that take place not here, but at the beginning of your<br/>acquaintance?" Fetyukovitch suggested cautiously, feeling his way,<br/>instantly scenting something favourable. I must mention in<br/>parenthesis that, though Fetyukovitch had been brought from<br/>Petersburg partly at the instance of Katerina Ivanovna herself, he<br/>knew nothing about the episode of the four thousand roubles given<br/>her by Mitya, and of her "bowing to the ground to him." She<br/>concealed this from him and said nothing about it, and that was<br/>strange. It may be pretty certainly assumed that she herself did<br/>not know till the very last minute whether she would speak of that<br/>episode in the court, and waited for the inspiration of the<br/>moment.<br/><br/>No, I can never forget those moments. She began telling her<br/>story. She told everything, the whole episode that Mitya had told<br/>Alyosha, and her bowing to the ground, and her reason. She told<br/>about her father and her going to Mitya, and did not in one word,<br/>in a single hint, suggest that Mitya had himself, through her<br/>sister, proposed they should "send him Katerina Ivanovna" to fetch<br/>the money. She generously concealed that and was not ashamed to<br/>make it appear as though she had of her own impulse run to the<br/>young officer, relying on something… to beg him for the money. It<br/>was something tremendous! I turned cold and trembled as I listened.<br/>The court was hushed, trying to catch each word. It was something<br/>unexampled. Even from such a self-willed and contemptuously proud<br/>girl as she was, such an extremely frank avowal, such sacrifice,<br/>such self-immolation, seemed incredible. And for what, for whom? To<br/>save the man who had deceived and insulted her and to help, in<br/>however small a degree, in saving him, by creating a strong<br/>impression in his favour. And, indeed, the figure of the young<br/>officer who, with a respectful bow to the innocent girl, handed her<br/>his last four thousand roubles- all he had in the world- was thrown<br/>into a very sympathetic and attractive light, but… I had a painful<br/>misgiving at heart! I felt that calumny might come of it later (and<br/>it did, in fact, it did). It was repeated all over the town<br/>afterwards with spiteful laughter that was perhaps not quite<br/>complete- that is, in the statement that the officer had let the<br/>young lady depart "with nothing but a respectful bow." It was<br/>hinted that something was here omitted.<br/><br/>"And even if nothing had been omitted, if this were the whole<br/>story," the most highly respected of our ladies maintained, "even<br/>then it's very doubtful whether it was creditable for a young girl<br/>to behave in that way, even for the sake of saving her father."<br/><br/>
