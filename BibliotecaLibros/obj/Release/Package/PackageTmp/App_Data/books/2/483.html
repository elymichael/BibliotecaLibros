<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>5<br/>Not You, Not You!<br/><br/><br/>ON the way to Ivan he had to pass the house where Katerina<br/>Ivanovna was living. There was light in the windows. He suddenly<br/>stopped and resolved to go in. He had not seen Katerina Ivanovna<br/>for more than a week. But now it struck him that Ivan might be with<br/>her, especially on the eve of the terrible day. Ringing, and<br/>mounting the staircase, which was dimly lighted by a Chinese<br/>lantern, he saw a man coming down, and as they met, he recognised<br/>him as his brother. So he was just coming from Katerina<br/>Ivanovna.<br/><br/>"Ah, it's only you," said Ivan dryly. "Well, good-bye! You are<br/>going to her?"<br/><br/>"Yes."<br/><br/>"I don't advise you to; she's upset and you'll upset her<br/>more."<br/><br/>A door was instantly flung open above, and a voice cried<br/>suddenly:<br/><br/>"No, no! Alexey Fyodorovitch, have you come from him?"<br/><br/>"Yes, I have been with him."<br/>
