"Yes, universal history! It's the study of the successive
follies of mankind and nothing more. The only subjects I respect
are mathematics and natural science," said Kolya. He was showing
off and he stole a glance at Alyosha; his was the only opinion he
was afraid of there. But Alyosha was still silent and still serious
as before. If Alyosha had said a word it would have stopped him,
but Alyosha was silent and "it might be the silence of contempt,"
and that finally irritated Kolya.

"The classical languages, too… they are simply madness, nothing
more. You seem to disagree with me again, Karamazov?"

"I don't agree," said Alyosha, with a faint smile.

"The study of the classics, if you ask my opinion, is simply a
police measure, that's simply why it has been introduced into our
schools." By degrees Kolya began to get breathless again. "Latin
and Greek were introduced because they are a bore and because they
stupefy the intellect. It was dull before, so what could they do to
make things duller? It was senseless enough before, so what could
they do to make it more senseless? So they thought of Greek and
Latin. That's my opinion, I hope I shall never change it," Kolya
finished abruptly. His cheeks were flushed.

"That's true," assented Smurov suddenly, in a ringing tone of
conviction. He had listened attentively.

"And yet he is first in Latin himself," cried one of the group
of boys suddenly.

"Yes, father, he says that and yet he is first in Latin," echoed
Ilusha.

"What of it?" Kolya thought fit to defend himself, though the
praise was very sweet to him. "I am fagging away at Latin because I
have to, because I promised my mother to pass my examination, and I
think that whatever you do, it's worth doing it well. But in my
soul I have a profound contempt for the classics and all that
fraud… . You don't agree, Karamazov?"

"Why 'fraud'?" Alyosha smiled again.

"Well, all the classical authors have been translated into all
languages, so it was not for the sake of studying the classics they
introduced Latin, but solely as a police measure, to stupefy the
intelligence. So what can one call it but a fraud?"

"Why, who taught you all this?" cried Alyosha, surprised at
last.
