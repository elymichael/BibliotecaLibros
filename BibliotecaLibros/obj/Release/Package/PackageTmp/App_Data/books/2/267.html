"For mercy's sake! It isn't a joke! You're drunk, perhaps. Yet<br/>you can speak and understand… or else… I understand nothing!"<br/><br/>"You're a painter!"<br/><br/>"For mercy's sake! I'm Karamazov, Dmitri Karamazov. I have an<br/>offer to make you, an advantageous offer… very advantageous offer,<br/>concerning the copse!"<br/><br/>The peasant stroked his beard importantly.<br/><br/>"No, you've contracted for the job and turned out a scamp.<br/>You're a scoundrel!"<br/><br/>"I assure you you're mistaken," cried Mitya, wringing his hands<br/>in despair. The peasant still stroked his beard, and suddenly<br/>screwed up his eyes cunningly.<br/><br/>"No, you show me this: you tell me the law that allows roguery.<br/>D'you hear? You're a scoundrel! Do you understand that?"<br/><br/>Mitya stepped back gloomily, and suddenly "something seemed to<br/>hit him on the head," as he said afterwards. In an instant a light<br/>seemed to dawn in his mind, "a light was kindled and I grasped it<br/>all." He stood, stupefied, wondering how he, after all a man of<br/>intelligence, could have yielded to such folly, have been led into<br/>such an adventure, and have kept it up for almost twenty-four<br/>hours, fussing round this Lyagavy, wetting his head.<br/><br/>"Why, the man's drunk, dead drunk, and he'll go on drinking now<br/>for a week; what's the use of waiting here? And what if Samsonov<br/>sent me here on purpose? What if she-&#160;? Oh God, what have I<br/>done?"<br/><br/>The peasant sat watching him and grinning. Another time Mitya<br/>might have killed the fool in a fury, but now he felt as weak as a<br/>child. He went quietly to the bench, took up his overcoat, put it<br/>on without a word, and went out of the hut. He did not find the<br/>forester in the next room; there was no one there. He took fifty<br/>copecks in small change out of his pocket and put them on the table<br/>for his night's lodging, the candle, and the trouble he had given.<br/>Coming out of the hut he saw nothing but forest all round. He<br/>walked at hazard, not knowing which way to turn out of the hut, to<br/>the right or to the left. Hurrying there the evening before with<br/>the priest, he had not noticed the road. He had no revengeful<br/>feeling for anybody, even for Samsonov, in his heart. He strode<br/>along a narrow forest path, aimless, dazed, without heeding where<br/>he was going. A child could have knocked him down, so weak was he<br/>in body and soul. He got out of the forest somehow, however, and a<br/>vista of fields, bare after the harvest, stretched as far as the<br/>eye could see.<br/><br/>"What despair! What death all round!" he repeated, striding on<br/>and on.<br/>
