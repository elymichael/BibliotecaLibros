<br/>"You see, I remember once taking a cap for a rag, perhaps to<br/>wipe my pen on. I took it without asking, because it was a<br/>worthless rag. I tore it up, and I took the notes and sewed them up<br/>in it. I believe it was in that very rag I sewed them. An old piece<br/>of calico, washed a thousand times."<br/><br/>"And you remember that for certain now?"<br/><br/>"I don't know whether for certain. I think it was in the cap.<br/>But, hang it, what does it matter?"<br/><br/>"In that case your landlady will remember that the thing was<br/>lost?"<br/><br/>"No, she won't, she didn't miss it. It was an old rag, I tell<br/>you, an old rag not worth a farthing."<br/><br/>"And where did you get the needle and thread?"<br/><br/>"I'll stop now. I won't say any more. Enough of it!" said Mitya,<br/>losing his temper at last.<br/><br/>"It's strange that you should have so completely forgotten where<br/>you threw the pieces in the market-place."<br/><br/>"Give orders for the market-place to be swept to-morrow, and<br/>perhaps you'll find it," said Mitya sneering. "Enough, gentlemen,<br/>enough!" he decided, in an exhausted voice. "I see you don't<br/>believe me! Not for a moment! It's my fault, not yours. I ought not<br/>to have been so ready. Why, why did I degrade myself by confessing<br/>my secret to you? it's a joke to you. I see that from your eyes.<br/>You led me on to it, prosecutor! Sing a hymn of triumph if you canâ€¦<br/>. Damn you, you torturers!"<br/><br/>He bent his head, and hid his face in his hands. The lawyers<br/>were silent. A minute later he raised his head and looked at them<br/>almost vacantly. His face now expressed complete, hopeless despair,<br/>and he sat mute and passive as though hardly conscious of what was<br/>happening. In the meantime they had to finish what they were about.<br/>They had immediately to begin examining the witnesses. It was by<br/>now eight o'clock in the morning. The lights had been extinguished<br/>long ago. Mihail Makarovitch and Kalganov, who had been continually<br/>in and out of the room all the while the interrogation had been<br/>going on, had now both gone out again. The lawyers, too, looked<br/>very tired. It was a wretched morning, the whole sky was overcast,<br/>and the rain streamed down in bucketfuls. Mitya gazed blankly out<br/>of window.<br/><br/>
