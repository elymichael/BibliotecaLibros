<br/>"I know, I know all. I've heard exactly what happened yesterday-<br/>and the atrocious behaviour of that- creature. C'est tragique, and<br/>if I'd been in her place I don't know what I should have done. And<br/>your brother Dmitri Fyodorovitch, what do you think of him?- my<br/>goodness! Alexey Fyodorovitch, I am forgetting, only fancy; your<br/>brother is in there with her, not that dreadful brother who was so<br/>shocking yesterday, but the other, Ivan Fyodorovitch, he is sitting<br/>with her talking; they are having a serious conversation. If you<br/>could only imagine what's passing between them now- it's awful, I<br/>tell you it's lacerating, it's like some incredible tale of horror.<br/>They are ruining their lives for no reason anyone can see. They<br/>both recognise it and revel in it. I've been watching for you! I've<br/>been thirsting for you! It's too much for me. that's the worst of<br/>it. I'll tell you all about it presently, but now I must speak of<br/>something else, the most important thing- I had quite forgotten<br/>what's most important. Tell me, why has Lise been in hysterics? As<br/>soon as she heard you were here, she began to be hysterical!"<br/><br/>"Maman, it's you who are hysterical now, not I," Lise's voice<br/>carolled through a tiny crack of the door at the side. Her voice<br/>sounded as though she wanted to laugh, but was doing her utmost to<br/>control it. Alyosha at once noticed the crack, and no doubt Lise<br/>was peeping through it, but that he could not see.<br/><br/>"And no wonder, Lise, no wonder… your caprices will make me<br/>hysterical too. But she is so ill, Alexey Fyodorovitch, she has<br/>been so ill all night, feverish and moaning! I could hardly wait<br/>for the morning and for Herzenstube to come. He says that he can<br/>make nothing of it, that we must wait. Herzenstube always comes and<br/>says that he can make nothing of it. As soon as you approached the<br/>house, she screamed, fell into hysterics, and insisted on being<br/>wheeled back into this room here."<br/><br/>"Mamma, I didn't know he had come. It wasn't on his account I<br/>wanted to be wheeled into this room."<br/><br/>"That's not true, Lise, Yulia ran to tell you that Alexey<br/>Fyodorovitch was coming. She was on the lookout for you."<br/><br/>"My darling mamma, it's not at all clever of you. But if you<br/>want to make up for it and say something very clever, dear mamma,<br/>you'd better tell our honoured visitor, Alexey Fyodorovitch, that<br/>he has shown his want of wit by venturing to us after what happened<br/>yesterday and although everyone is laughing at him."<br/><br/>"Lise, you go too far. I declare I shall have to be severe. Who<br/>laughs at him? I am so glad he has come, I need him, I can't do<br/>without him. Oh, Alexey Fyodorovitch, I am exceedingly<br/>unhappy!"<br/><br/>"But what's the matter with you, mamma, darling?"<br/><br/>"Ah, your caprices, Lise, your fidgetiness, your illness, that<br/>awful night of fever, that awful everlasting Herzenstube,<br/>everlasting, everlasting, that's the worst of it! Everything, in<br/>fact, everything… . Even that miracle, too! Oh, how it has upset<br/>me, how it has shattered me, that miracle, dear Alexey<br/>Fyodorovitch! And that tragedy in the drawing-room, it's more than<br/>I can bear, I warn you. I can't bear it. A comedy, perhaps, not a<br/>tragedy. Tell me, will Father Zossima live till to-morrow, will he?<br/>Oh, my God! What is happening to me? Every minute I close my eyes<br/>and see that it's all nonsense, all nonsense."<br/><br/>"I should be very grateful," Alyosha interrupted suddenly, "if<br/>you could give me a clean rag to bind up my finger with. I have<br/>hurt it, and it's very painful."<br/><br/>
