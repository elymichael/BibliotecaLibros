A perfect picture! Ah, if only girls were<br/>allowed to look on, I'd give anything to see one!"<br/><br/>"It's all very well when you are firing at someone, but when he<br/>is firing straight in your mug, you must feel pretty silly. You'd<br/>be glad to run away, Marya Kondratyevna."<br/><br/>"You don't mean you would run away?" But Smerdyakov did not<br/>deign to reply. After a moment's silence the guitar tinkled again,<br/>and he sang again in the same falsetto:<br/><br/>Whatever you may say,<br/><br/>I shall go far away.<br/><br/>Life will be bright and gay<br/><br/>In the city far away.<br/><br/>I shall not grieve,<br/><br/>I shall not grieve at all,<br/>
