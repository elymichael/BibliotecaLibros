"And what followed? Notes for three thousand roubles were<br/>brought into the court just now, and we were told that they were<br/>the same that lay in the envelope now on the table before us, and<br/>that the witness had received them from Smerdyakov the day before.<br/>But I need not recall the painful scene, though I will make one or<br/>two comments, selecting such trivial ones as might not be obvious<br/>at first sight to everyone, and so may be overlooked. In the first<br/>place, Smerdyakov must have given back the money and hanged himself<br/>yesterday from remorse. And only yesterday he confessed his guilt<br/>to Ivan Karamazov, as the latter informs us. If it were not so,<br/>indeed, why should Ivan Fyodorovitch have kept silence till now?<br/>And so, if he has confessed, then why, I ask again, did he not avow<br/>the whole truth in the last letter he left behind, knowing that the<br/>innocent prisoner had to face this terrible ordeal the next<br/>day?<br/><br/>"The money alone is no proof. A week ago, quite by chance, the<br/>fact came to the knowledge of myself and two other persons in this<br/>court that Ivan Fyodorovitch had sent two five per cent coupons of<br/>five thousand each- that is, ten thousand in all- to the chief town<br/>of the province to be changed. I only mention this to point out<br/>that anyone may have money, and that it can't be proved that these<br/>notes are the same as were in Fyodor Pavlovitch's envelope.<br/><br/>"Ivan Karamazov, after receiving yesterday a communication of<br/>such importance from the real murderer, did not stir. Why didn't he<br/>report it at once? Why did he put it all off till morning? I think<br/>I have a right to conjecture why. His health had been giving way<br/>for a week past: he had admitted to a doctor and to his most<br/>intimate friends that he was suffering from hallucinations and<br/>seeing phantoms of the dead: he was on the eve of the attack of<br/>brain fever by which he has been stricken down to-day. In this<br/>condition he suddenly heard of Smerdyakov's death, and at once<br/>reflected. 'The man is dead, I can throw the blame on him and save<br/>my brother. I have money. I will take a roll of notes and say that<br/>Smerdyakov gave them me before his death.' You will say that was<br/>dishonourable: it's dishonourable to slander even the dead, and<br/>even to save a brother. True, but what if he slandered him<br/>unconsciously? What if, finally unhinged by the sudden news of the<br/>valet's death, he imagined it really was so? You saw the recent<br/>scene: you have seen the witness's condition. He was standing up<br/>and was speaking, but where was his mind?<br/><br/>"Then followed the document, the prisoner's letter written two<br/>days before the crime, and containing a complete programme of the<br/>murder. Why, then, are we looking for any other programme? The<br/>crime was committed precisely according to this programme, and by<br/>no other than the writer of it. Yes, gentlemen of the jury, it went<br/>off without a hitch! He did not run respectfully and timidly away<br/>from his father's window, though he was firmly convinced that the<br/>object of his affections was with him. No, that is absurd and<br/>unlikely! He went in and murdered him. Most likely he killed him in<br/>anger, burning with resentment, as soon as he looked on his hated<br/>rival. But having killed him, probably with one blow of the brass<br/>pestle, and having convinced himself, after careful search, that<br/>she was not there, he did not, however, forget to put his hand<br/>under the pillow and take out the envelope, the torn cover of which<br/>lies now on the table before us.<br/><br/>"I mention this fact that you may note one, to my thinking, very<br/>characteristic circumstance. Had he been an experienced murderer<br/>and had he committed the murder for the sake of gain only, would he<br/>have left the torn envelope on the floor as it was found, beside<br/>the corpse? Had it been Smerdyakov, for instance, murdering his<br/>master to rob him, he would have simply carried away the envelope<br/>with him, without troubling himself to open it over his victim's<br/>corpse, for he would have known for certain that the notes were in<br/>the envelope- they had been put in and sealed up in his presence-<br/>and had he taken the envelope with him, no one would ever have<br/>known of the robbery. I ask you, gentlemen, would Smerdyakov have<br/>behaved in that way? Would he have left the envelope on the<br/>floor?<br/><br/>"No, this was the action of a frantic murderer, a murderer who<br/>was not a thief and had never stolen before that day, who snatched<br/>the notes from under the pillow, not like a thief stealing them,<br/>but as though seizing his own property from the thief who had<br/>stolen it. For that was the idea which had become almost an insane<br/>obsession in Dmitri Karamazov in regard to that money. And pouncing<br/>upon the envelope, which he had never seen before, he tore it open<br/>to make sure whether the money was in it, and ran away with the<br/>money in his pocket, even forgetting to consider that he had left<br/>an astounding piece of evidence against himself in that torn<br/>envelope on the floor. All because it was Karamazov, not<br/>Smerdyakov, he didn't think, he didn't reflect, and how should he?<br/>He ran away; he heard behind him the servant cry out; the old man<br/>caught him, stopped him and was felled to the ground by the brass<br/>pestle.<br/><br/>"The prisoner, moved by pity, leapt down to look at him. Would<br/>you believe it, he tells us that he leapt down out of pity, out of<br/>compassion, to see whether he could do anything for him. Was that a<br/>moment to show compassion? No; he jumped down simply to make<br/>certain whether the only witness of his crime were dead or alive.<br/>Any other feeling, any other motive would be unnatural. Note that<br/>he took trouble over Grigory, wiped his head with his handkerchief<br/>and, convincing himself he was dead, he ran to the house of his<br/>mistress, dazed and covered with blood. How was it he never thought<br/>that he was covered with blood and would be at once detected? But<br/>the prisoner himself assures us that he did not even notice that he<br/>was covered with blood. That may be believed, that is very<br/>possible, that always happens at such moments with criminals. On<br/>one point they will show diabolical cunning, while another will<br/>escape them altogether. But he was thinking at that moment of one<br/>thing only- where was she? He wanted to find out at once where she<br/>was, so he ran to her lodging and learnt an unexpected and<br/>astounding piece of news- she had gone off to Mokroe to meet her<br/>first lover."<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
