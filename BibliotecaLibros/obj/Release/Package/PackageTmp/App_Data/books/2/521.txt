"Take that money away with you," Smerdyakov sighed.

"Of course, I shall take it. But why do you give it to me, if
you committed the murder for the sake of it?" Ivan looked at him
with great surprise.

"I don't want it," Smerdyakov articulated in a shaking voice,
with a gesture of refusal. "I did have an idea of beginning a new
life with that money in Moscow or, better still, abroad. I did
dream of it, chiefly because 'all things are lawful.' That was
quite right what you taught me, for you talked a lot to me about
that. For if there's no everlasting God, there's no such thing as
virtue, and there's no need of it. You were right there. So that's
how I looked at it."

"Did you come to that of yourself?" asked Ivan, with a wry
smile.

"With your guidance."

"And now, I suppose, you believe in God, since you are giving
back the money?"

"No, I don't believe," whispered Smerdyakov.

"Then why are you giving it back?"

"Leave off… that's enough!" Smerdyakov waved his hand again.
"You used to say yourself that everything was lawful, so now why
are you so upset, too? You even want to go and give evidence
against yourself… . Only there'll be nothing of the sort! You won't
go to give evidence," Smerdyakov decided with conviction.

"You'll see," said Ivan.

"It isn't possible. You are very clever. You are fond of money,
I know that. You like to be respected, too, for you're very proud;
you are far too fond of female charms, too, and you mind most of
all about living in undisturbed comfort, without having to depend
on anyone- that's what you care most about. You won't want to spoil
your life for ever by taking such a disgrace on yourself. You are
like Fyodor Pavlovitch, you are more like him than any of his
children; you've the same soul as he had."
