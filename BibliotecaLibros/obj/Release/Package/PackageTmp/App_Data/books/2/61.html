It was at that moment Rakitin saw him and pointed him out to<br/>Alyosha.<br/><br/>"Alexey!" his father shouted, from far off, catching sight of<br/>him. "You come home to me to-day, for good, and bring your pillow<br/>and mattress, and leave no trace behind."<br/><br/>Alyosha stood rooted to the spot, watching the scene in silence.<br/>Meanwhile, Fyodor Pavlovitch had got into the carriage, and Ivan<br/>was about to follow him in grim silence without even turning to say<br/>good-bye to Alyosha. But at this point another almost incredible<br/>scene of grotesque buffoonery gave the finishing touch to the<br/>episode. Maximov suddenly appeared by the side of the carriage. He<br/>ran up, panting, afraid of being too late. Rakitin and Alyosha saw<br/>him running. He was in such a hurry that in his impatience he put<br/>his foot on the step on which Ivan's left foot was still resting,<br/>and clutching the carriage he kept trying to jump in. "I am going<br/>with you! " he kept shouting, laughing a thin mirthful laugh with a<br/>look of reckless glee in his face. "Take me, too."<br/><br/>"There!" cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, delighted. "Did I not say he<br/>was von Sohn. It is von Sohn himself, risen from the dead. Why, how<br/>did you tear yourself away? What did you von Sohn there? And how<br/>could you get away from the dinner? You must be a brazen-faced<br/>fellow! I am that myself, but I am surprised at you, brother! Jump<br/>in, jump in! Let him pass, Ivan. It will be fun. He can lie<br/>somewhere at our feet. Will you lie at our feet, von Sohn? Or perch<br/>on the box with the coachman. Skip on to the box, von Sohn!"<br/><br/>But Ivan, who had by now taken his seat, without a word gave<br/>Maximov a violent punch in the breast and sent him flying. It was<br/>quite by chance he did not fall.<br/><br/>"Drive on!" Ivan shouted angrily to the coachman.<br/><br/>"Why, what are you doing, what are you about? Why did you do<br/>that?" Fyodor Pavlovitch protested.<br/><br/>But the carriage had already driven away. Ivan made no<br/>reply.<br/><br/>"Well, you are a fellow," Fyodor Pavlovitch said again.<br/><br/>After a pause of two minutes, looking askance at his son, "Why,<br/>it was you got up all this monastery business. You urged it, you<br/>approved of it. Why are you angry now?"<br/><br/>"You've talked rot enough. You might rest a bit now," Ivan<br/>snapped sullenly.<br/>
