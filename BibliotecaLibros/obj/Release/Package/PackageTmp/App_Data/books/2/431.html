"How could I tell I had hit on a clever one?<br/>I am always ready to recognise intelligence in the peasantry."<br/><br/>In the distance the cathedral clock struck half-past eleven. The<br/>boys made haste and they walked as far as Captain Snegiryov's<br/>lodging, a considerable distance, quickly and almost in silence.<br/>Twenty paces from the house Kolya stopped and told Smurov to go on<br/>ahead and ask Karamazov to come out to him.<br/><br/>"One must sniff round a bit first," he observed to Smurov.<br/><br/>"Why ask him to come out?" Smurov protested. "You go in; they<br/>will be awfully glad to see you. What's the sense of making friends<br/>in the frost out here?"<br/>
