"We quite understand that you made that statement just now
through exasperation with us and the questions we put to you, which
you consider trivial, though they are, in fact, essential," the
prosecutor remarked drily in reply.

"Well, upon my word, gentlemen! Yes, I took the pestle… . What
does one pick things up for at such moments? I don't know what for.
I snatched it up and ran- that's all. For to me, gentlemen,
