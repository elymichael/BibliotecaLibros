<br/>But even though he exclaimed he still preserved for a time his<br/>genially expansive mood. So he told them how Samsonov had made a<br/>fool of him two days before. (He had completely realised by now<br/>that he had been fooled.) The sale of his watch for six roubles to<br/>obtain money for the journey was something new to the lawyers. They<br/>were at once greatly interested, and even, to Mitya's intense<br/>indignation, thought it necessary to write the fact down as a<br/>secondary confirmation of the circumstance that he had hardly a<br/>farthing in his pocket at the time. Little by little Mitya began to<br/>grow surly. Then, after describing his journey to see Lyagavy, the<br/>night spent in the stifling hut, and so on, he came to his return<br/>to the town. Here he began, without being particularly urged, to<br/>give a minute account of the agonies of jealousy he endured on<br/>Grushenka's account.<br/><br/>He was heard with silent attention. They inquired particularly<br/>into the circumstance of his having a place of ambush in Marya<br/>Kondratyevna's house at the back of Fyodor Pavlovitch's garden to<br/>keep watch on Grushenka, and of Smerdyakov's bringing him<br/>information. They laid particular stress on this, and noted it<br/>down. Of his jealousy he spoke warmly and at length, and though<br/>inwardly ashamed at exposing his most intimate feelings to "public<br/>ignominy," so to speak, he evidently overcame his shame in order to<br/>tell the truth. The frigid severity with which the investigating<br/>lawyer, and still more the prosecutor, stared intently at him as he<br/>told his story, disconcerted him at last considerably.<br/><br/>"That boy, Nikolay Parfenovitch, to whom I was talking nonsense<br/>about women only a few days ago, and that sickly prosecutor are not<br/>worth my telling this to," he reflected mournfully. "It's<br/>ignominious. 'Be patient, humble, hold thy peace.'" He wound up his<br/>reflections with that line. But he pulled himself together to go on<br/>again. When he came to telling of his visit to Madame Hohlakov, he<br/>regained his spirits and even wished to tell a little anecdote of<br/>that lady which had nothing to do with the case. But the<br/>investigating lawyer stopped him, and civilly suggested that he<br/>should pass on to "more essential matters." At last, when he<br/>described his despair and told them how, when he left Madame<br/>Hohlakov's, he thought that he'd "get three thousand if he had to<br/>murder someone to do it," they stopped him again and noted down<br/>that he had "meant to murder someone." Mitya let them write it<br/>without protest. At last he reached the point in his story when he<br/>learned that Grushenka had deceived him and had returned from<br/>Samsonov's as soon as he left her there, though she had said that<br/>she would stay there till midnight.<br/><br/>"If I didn't kill Fenya then, gentlemen, it was only because I<br/>hadn't time," broke from him suddenly at that point in his story.<br/>That, too, was carefully written down. Mitya waited gloomily, and<br/>was beginning to tell how he ran into his father's garden when the<br/>investigating lawyer suddenly stopped him, and opening the big<br/>portfolio that lay on the sofa beside him he brought out the brass<br/>pestle.<br/><br/>"Do you recognise this object?" he asked, showing it to<br/>Mitya.<br/><br/>"Oh, yes," he laughed gloomily. "Of course, I recognise it. Let<br/>me have a look at itâ€¦ . Damn it, never mind!"<br/><br/>"You have forgotten to mention it," observed the investigating<br/>lawyer.<br/><br/>"Hang it all, I shouldn't have concealed it from you. Do you<br/>suppose I could have managed without it? It simply escaped my<br/>memory."<br/><br/>"Be so good as to tell us precisely how you came to arm yourself<br/>with it."<br/><br/>"Certainly I will be so good, gentlemen."<br/><br/>
