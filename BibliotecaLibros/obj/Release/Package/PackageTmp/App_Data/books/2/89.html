<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>7<br/>The Controversy<br/><br/><br/>BUT Balaam's ass had suddenly spoken. The subject was a strange<br/>one. Grigory had gone in the morning to make purchases, and had<br/>heard from the shopkeeper Lukyanov the story of a Russian soldier<br/>which had appeared in the newspaper of that day. This soldier had<br/>been taken prisoner in some remote part of Asia, and was threatened<br/>with an immediate agonising death if he did not renounce<br/>Christianity and follow Islam. He refused to deny his faith, and<br/>was tortured, flayed alive, and died, praising and glorifying<br/>Christ. Grigory had related the story at table. Fyodor Pavlovitch<br/>always liked, over the dessert after dinner, to laugh and talk, if<br/>only with Grigory. This afternoon he was in a particularly<br/>good-humoured and expansive mood. Sipping his brandy and listening<br/>to the story, he observed that they ought to make a saint of a<br/>soldier like that, and to take his skin to some monastery. "That<br/>would make the people flock, and bring the money in."<br/><br/>Grigory frowned, seeing that Fyodor Pavlovitch was by no means<br/>touched, but, as usual, was beginning to scoff. At that moment<br/>Smerdyakov, who was standing by the door, smiled. Smerdyakov often<br/>waited at table towards the end of dinner, and since Ivan's arrival<br/>in our town he had done so every day.<br/><br/>"What are you grinning at?" asked Fyodor Pavlovitch, catching<br/>the smile instantly, and knowing that it referred to Grigory.<br/><br/>"Well, my opinion is," Smerdyakov began suddenly and<br/>unexpectedly in a loud voice, "that if that laudable soldier's<br/>exploit was so very great there would have been, to my thinking, no<br/>sin in it if he had on such an emergency renounced, so to speak,<br/>the name of Christ and his own christening, to save by that same<br/>his life, for good deeds, by which, in the course of years to<br/>expiate his cowardice."<br/><br/>"How could it not be a sin? You're talking nonsense. For that<br/>you'll go straight to hell and be roasted there like mutton," put<br/>in Fyodor Pavlovitch.<br/><br/>It was at this point that Alyosha came in, and Fyodor<br/>Pavlovitch, as we have seen, was highly delighted at his<br/>appearance.<br/><br/>"We're on your subject, your subject," he chuckled gleefully,<br/>making Alyosha sit down to listen.<br/>
