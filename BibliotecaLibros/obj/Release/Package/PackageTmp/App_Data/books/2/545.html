<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>4<br/>Fortune Smiles on Mitya<br/><br/><br/>IT came quite as a surprise even to Alyosha himself. He was not<br/>required to take the oath, and I remember that both sides addressed<br/>him very gently and sympathetically. It was evident that his<br/>reputation for goodness had preceded him. Alyosha gave his evidence<br/>modestly and with restraint, but his warm sympathy for his unhappy<br/>brother was unmistakable. In answer to one question, he sketched<br/>his brother's character as that of a man, violent-tempered perhaps<br/>and carried away by his passions, but at the same time honourable,<br/>proud and generous, capable of self-sacrifice, if necessary. He<br/>admitted, however, that, through his passion for Grushenka and his<br/>rivalry with his father, his brother had been of late in an<br/>intolerable position. But he repelled with indignation the<br/>suggestion that his brother might have committed a murder for the<br/>sake of gain, though he recognised that the three thousand roubles<br/>had become almost an obsession with Mitya; that upon them as part<br/>of the inheritance he had been cheated of by his father, and that,<br/>indifferent as he was to money as a rule, he could not even speak<br/>of that three thousand without fury. As for the rivalry of the two<br/>"ladies," as the prosecutor expressed it- that is, of Grushenka and<br/>Katya- he answered evasively and was even unwilling to answer one<br/>or two questions altogether.<br/><br/>"Did your brother tell you, anyway, that he intended to kill<br/>your father?" asked the prosecutor. "You can refuse to answer if<br/>you think necessary," he added.<br/><br/>"He did not tell me so directly," answered Alyosha.<br/><br/>"How so? Did he indirectly?"<br/><br/>"He spoke to me once of his hatred for our father and his fear<br/>that at an extreme momentâ€¦ at a moment of fury, he might perhaps<br/>murder him."<br/><br/>"And you believed him?"<br/><br/>"I am afraid to say that I did. But I never doubted that some<br/>higher feeling would always save him at that fatal moment, as it<br/>has indeed saved him, for it was not he killed my father," Alyosha<br/>said firmly, in a loud voice that was heard throughout the<br/>court.<br/>
