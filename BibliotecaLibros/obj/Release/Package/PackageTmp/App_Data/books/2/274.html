<br/>"Madam, I am so touched. I don't know how to thank you, indeed…<br/>for such kindness, but… If only you knew how precious time is to<br/>me… . That sum of money, for which I shall be indebted to your<br/>generosity… Oh, madam, since you are so kind, so touchingly<br/>generous to me," Mitya exclaimed impulsively, "then let me reveal<br/>to you… though, of course, you've known it a long time… that I love<br/>somebody here… . I have been false to Katya… Katerina Ivanovna I<br/>should say… . Oh, I've behaved inhumanly, dishonourably to her, but<br/>I fell in love here with another woman… a woman whom you, madam,<br/>perhaps, despise, for you know everything already, but whom I<br/>cannot leave on any account, and therefore that three thousand<br/>now-"<br/><br/>"Leave everything, Dmitri Fyodorovitch," Madame Hohlakov<br/>interrupted in the most decisive tone. "Leave everything,<br/>especially women. Gold mines are your goal, and there's no place<br/>for women there. Afterwards, when you come back rich and famous,<br/>you will find the girl of your heart in the highest society. That<br/>will be a modern girl, a girl of education and advanced ideas. By<br/>that time the dawning woman question will have gained ground, and<br/>the new woman will have appeared."<br/><br/>"Madam, that's not the point, not at all… . Mitya clasped his<br/>hands in entreaty.<br/><br/>"Yes it is, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, just what you need; the very<br/>thing you're yearning for, though you don't realise it yourself. I<br/>am not at all opposed to the present woman movement, Dmitri<br/>Fyodorovitch. The development of woman, and even the political<br/>emancipation of woman in the near future- that's my ideal. I've a<br/>daughter myself, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, people don't know that side<br/>of me. I wrote a letter to the author, Shtchedrin, on that subject.<br/>He has taught me so much, so much about the vocation of woman. So<br/>last year I sent him an anonymous letter of two lines: 'I kiss and<br/>embrace you, my teacher, for the modern woman. Persevere.' And I<br/>signed myself, 'A Mother.' I thought of signing myself 'A<br/>contemporary Mother,' and hesitated, but I stuck to the simple<br/>'Mother'; there's more moral beauty in that, Dmitri Fyodorovitch.<br/>And the word 'contemporary' might have reminded him of The<br/>Contemporary- a painful recollection owing to the censorship… .<br/>Good Heavens, what is the matter!"<br/><br/>"Madam!" cried Mitya, jumping up at last, clasping his hands<br/>before her in helpless entreaty. "You will make me weep if you<br/>delay what you have so generously-"<br/><br/>"Oh, do weep, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, do weep! That's a noble<br/>feeling… such a path lies open before you! Tears will ease your<br/>heart, and later on you will return rejoicing. You will hasten to<br/>me from Siberia on purpose to share your joy with me-"<br/><br/>"But allow me, too!" Mitya cried suddenly.<br/><br/>"For the last time I entreat you, tell me, can I have the sum<br/>you promised me to-day, if not, when may I come for it?"<br/><br/>"What sum, Dmitri Fyodorovitch?"<br/><br/>"The three thousand you promised me… that you so<br/>generously-"<br/><br/>
