"Why, I'd quite forgotten about her," said Smerdyakov, with a
scornful smile, and turning his face to Ivan again, he stared at
him with a look of frenzied hatred, the same look that he had fixed
on him at their last interview, a month before.

"You seem very ill yourself, your face is sunken; you don't look
like yourself," he said to Ivan.

"Never mind my health, tell me what I ask you.,

"But why are your eyes so yellow? The whites are quite yellow.
Are you so worried?" He smiled contemptuously and suddenly laughed
outright.

"Listen; I've told you I won't go away without an answer!" Ivan
cried, intensely irritated.

"Why do you keep pestering me? Why do you torment me?" said
Smerdyakov, with a look of suffering.

"Damn it! I've nothing to do with you. Just answer my question
and I'll go away."

"I've no answer to give you," said Smerdyakov, looking down
again.

"You may be sure I'll make you answer!"

"Why are you so uneasy?" Smerdyakov stared at him, not simply
with contempt, but almost with repulsion. "Is this because the
trial begins to-morrow? Nothing will happen to you; can't you
believe that at last? Go home, go to bed and sleep in peace, don't
be afraid of anything."

"I don't understand youâ€¦ . What have I to be afraid of
to-morrow?" Ivan articulated in astonishment, and suddenly a chill
breath of fear did in fact pass over his soul. Smerdyakov measured
him with his eyes.
