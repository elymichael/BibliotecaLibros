"The effect of it was amazing. He leapt up and shouted to us,<br/>'Then Smerdyakov murdered him, it was Smerdyakov!' and so betrayed<br/>the basis of the defence he was keeping back, and betrayed it in<br/>its most improbable shape, for Smerdyakov could only have committed<br/>the murder after he had knocked Grigory down and run away. When we<br/>told him that Grigory saw the door was open before he fell down,<br/>and had heard Smerdyakov behind the screen as he came out of his<br/>bedroom- Karamazov was positively crushed. My esteemed and witty<br/>colleague, Nikolay Parfenovitch, told me afterwards that he was<br/>almost moved to tears at the sight of him. And to improve matters,<br/>the prisoner hastened to tell us about the much-talked-of little<br/>bag- so be it, you shall hear this romance!<br/><br/>"Gentlemen of the jury, I have told you already why I consider<br/>this romance not only an absurdity, but the most improbable<br/>invention that could have been brought forward in the<br/>circumstances. If one tried for a bet to invent the most unlikely<br/>story, one could hardly find anything more incredible. The worst of<br/>such stories is that the triumphant romancers can always be put to<br/>confusion and crushed by the very details in which real life is so<br/>rich and which these unhappy and involuntary storytellers neglect<br/>as insignificant trifles. Oh, they have no thought to spare for<br/>such details, their minds are concentrated on their grand invention<br/>as a whole, and fancy anyone daring to pull them up for a trifle!<br/>But that's how they are caught. The prisoner was asked the<br/>question, 'Where did you get the stuff for your little bag and who<br/>made it for you?' 'I made it myself.' 'And where did you get the<br/>linen?' The prisoner was positively offended, he thought it almost<br/>insulting to ask him such a trivial question, and would you believe<br/>it, his resentment was genuine! But they are all like that. 'I tore<br/>it off my shirt. "Then we shall find that shirt among your linen<br/>to-morrow, with a piece torn off.' And only fancy, gentlemen of the<br/>jury, if we really had found that torn shirt (and how could we have<br/>failed to find it in his chest of drawers or trunk?) that would<br/>have been a fact, a material fact in support of his statement! But<br/>he was incapable of that reflection. 'I don't remember, it may not<br/>have been off my shirt, I sewed it up in one of my landlady's<br/>caps.' 'What sort of a cap?' 'It was an old cotton rag of hers<br/>lying about.' 'And do you remember that clearly?' 'No, I don't.'<br/>And he was angry, very angry, and yet imagine not remembering it!<br/>At the most terrible moments of man's life, for instance when he is<br/>being led to execution, he remembers just such trifles. He will<br/>forget anything but some green roof that has flashed past him on<br/>the road, or a jackdaw on a cross- that he will remember. He<br/>concealed the making of that little bag from his household, he must<br/>have remembered his humiliating fear that someone might come in and<br/>find him needle in hand, how at the slightest sound he slipped<br/>behind the screen (there is a screen in his lodgings).<br/><br/>"But, gentlemen of the jury, why do I tell you all this, all<br/>these details, trifles?" cried Ippolit Kirillovitch suddenly. "Just<br/>because the prisoner still persists in these absurdities to this<br/>moment. He has not explained anything since that fatal night two<br/>months ago, he has not added one actual illuminating fact to his<br/>former fantastic statements; all those are trivialities. 'You must<br/>believe it on my honour.' Oh, we are glad to believe it, we are<br/>eager to believe it, even if only on his word of honour! Are we<br/>jackals thirsting for human blood? Show us a single fact in the<br/>prisoner's favour and we shall rejoice; but let it be a<br/>substantial, real fact, and not a conclusion drawn from the<br/>prisoner's expression by his own brother, or that when he beat<br/>himself on the breast he must have meant to point to the little<br/>bag, in the darkness, too. We shall rejoice at the new fact, we<br/>shall be the first to repudiate our charge, we shall hasten to<br/>repudiate it. But now justice cries out and we persist, we cannot<br/>repudiate anything."<br/><br/>Ippolit Kirillovitch passed to his final peroration. He looked<br/>as though he was in a fever, he spoke of the blood that cried for<br/>vengeance, the blood of the father murdered by his son, with the<br/>base motive of robbery! He pointed to the tragic and glaring<br/>consistency of the facts.<br/><br/>"And whatever you may hear from the talented and celebrated<br/>counsel for the defence," Ippolit Kirillovitch could not resist<br/>adding, "whatever eloquent and touching appeals may be made to your<br/>sensibilities, remember that at this moment you are in a temple of<br/>justice. Remember that you are the champions of our justice, the<br/>champions of our holy Russia, of her principles, her family,<br/>everything that she holds sacred! Yes, you represent Russia here at<br/>this moment, and your verdict will be heard not in this hall only<br/>but will re-echo throughout the whole of Russia, and all Russia<br/>will hear you, as her champions and her judges, and she will be<br/>encouraged or disheartened by your verdict. Do not disappoint<br/>Russia and her expectations. Our fatal troika dashes on in her<br/>headlong flight perhaps to destruction and in all Russia for long<br/>past men have stretched out imploring hands and called a halt to<br/>its furious reckless course. And if other nations stand aside from<br/>that troika that may be, not from respect, as the poet would fain<br/>believe, but simply from horror. From horror, perhaps from disgust.<br/>And well it is that they stand aside, but maybe they will cease one<br/>day to do so and will form a firm wall confronting the hurrying<br/>apparition and will check the frenzied rush of our lawlessness, for<br/>the sake of their own safety, enlightenment and civilisation.<br/>Already we have heard voices of alarm from Europe, they already<br/>begin to sound. Do not tempt them! Do not heap up their growing<br/>hatred by a sentence justifying the murder of a father by his son<br/>I<br/><br/>Though Ippolit Kirillovitch was genuinely moved, he wound up his<br/>speech with this rhetorical appeal- and the effect produced by him<br/>was extraordinary. When he had finished his speech, he went out<br/>hurriedly and, as I have mentioned before, almost fainted in the<br/>adjoining room. There was no applause in the court, but serious<br/>persons were pleased. The ladies were not so well satisfied, though<br/>even they were pleased with his eloquence, especially as they had<br/>no apprehensions as to the upshot of the trial and had full trust<br/>in Fetyukovitch. "He will speak at last and of course carry all<br/>before him."<br/><br/>Everyone looked at Mitya; he sat silent through the whole of the<br/>prosecutor's speech, clenching his teeth, with his hands clasped,<br/>and his head bowed. Only from time to time he raised his head and<br/>listened, especially when Grushenka was spoken of. When the<br/>prosecutor mentioned Rakitin's opinion of her, a smile of contempt<br/>and anger passed over his face and he murmured rather audibly, "The<br/>Bernards!" When Ippolit Kirillovitch described how he had<br/>questioned and tortured him at Mokroe, Mitya raised his head and<br/>listened with intense curiosity. At one point he seemed about to<br/>jump up and cry out, but controlled himself and only shrugged his<br/>shoulders disdainfully. People talked afterwards of the end of the<br/>speech, of the prosecutor's feat in examining the prisoner at<br/>Mokroe, and jeered at Ippolit Kirillovitch. "The man could not<br/>resist boasting of his cleverness," they said.<br/><br/>The court was adjourned, but only for a short interval, a<br/>quarter of an hour or twenty minutes at most. There was a hum of<br/>conversation and exclamations in the audience. I remember some of<br/>them.<br/><br/>"A weighty speech," a gentleman in one group observed<br/>gravely.<br/><br/>"He brought in too much psychology," said another voice.<br/><br/>"But it was all true, the absolute truth!"<br/>
