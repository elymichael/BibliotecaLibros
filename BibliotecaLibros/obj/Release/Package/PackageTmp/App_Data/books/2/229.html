As soon as signs of decomposition had begun to appear, the whole<br/>aspect of the monks betrayed their secret motives in entering the<br/>cell. They went in, stayed a little while and hastened out to<br/>confirm the news to the crowd of other monks waiting outside. Some<br/>of the latter shook their heads mournfully, but others did not even<br/>care to conceal the delight which gleamed unmistakably in their<br/>malignant eyes. And now no one reproached them for it, no one<br/>raised his voice in protest, which was strange, for the majority of<br/>the monks had been devoted to the dead elder. But it seemed as<br/>though God had in this case let the minority get the upper hand for<br/>a time.<br/><br/>Visitors from outside, particularly of the educated class, soon<br/>went into the cell, too, with the same spying intent. Of the<br/>peasantry few went into the cell, though there were crowds of them<br/>at the gates of the hermitage. After three o'clock the rush of<br/>worldly visitors was greatly increased and this was no doubt owing<br/>to the shocking news. People were attracted who would not otherwise<br/>have come on that day and had not intended to come, and among them<br/>were some personages of high standing. But external decorum was<br/>still preserved and Father Paissy, with a stern face, continued<br/>firmly and distinctly reading aloud the Gospel, apparently not<br/>noticing what was taking place around him, though he had, in fact,<br/>observed something unusual long before. But at last the murmurs,<br/>first subdued but gradually louder and more confident, reached even<br/>him. "It shows God's judgment is not as man's," Father Paissy heard<br/>suddenly. The first to give utterance to this sentiment was a<br/>layman, an elderly official from the town, known to be a man of<br/>great piety. But he only repeated aloud what the monks had long<br/>been whispering. They had long before formulated this damning<br/>conclusion, and the worst of it was that a sort of triumphant<br/>satisfaction at that conclusion became more and more apparent every<br/>moment. Soon they began to lay aside even external decorum and<br/>almost seemed to feel they had a sort of right to discard it.<br/><br/>"And for what reason can this have happened," some of the monks<br/>said, at first with a show of regret; "he had a small frame and his<br/>flesh was dried up on his bones, what was there to decay?"<br/><br/>"It must be a sign from heaven," others hastened to add, and<br/>their opinion was adopted at once without protest. For it was<br/>pointed out, too, that if the decomposition had been natural, as in<br/>the case of every dead sinner, it would have been apparent later,<br/>after a lapse of at least twenty-four hours, but this premature<br/>corruption "was in excess of nature," and so the finger of God was<br/>evident. It was meant for a sign. This conclusion seemed<br/>irresistible.<br/><br/>Gentle Father Iosif, the librarian, a great favourite of the<br/>dead man's, tried to reply to some of the evil speakers that "this<br/>is not held everywhere alike," and that the incorruptibility of the<br/>bodies of the just was not a dogma of the Orthodox Church, but only<br/>an opinion, and that even in the most Orthodox regions, at Athos<br/>for instance, they were not greatly confounded by the smell of<br/>corruption, and there the chief sign of the glorification of the<br/>saved was not bodily incorruptibility, but the colour of the bones<br/>when the bodies have lain many years in the earth and have decayed<br/>in it. "And if the bones are yellow as wax, that is the great sign<br/>that the Lord has glorified the dead saint, if they are not yellow<br/>but black, it shows that God has not deemed him worthy of such<br/>glory- that is the belief in Athos, a great place, which the<br/>Orthodox doctrine has been preserved from of old, unbroken and in<br/>its greatest purity," said Father Iosif in conclusion.<br/><br/>But the meek Father's words had little effect and even provoked<br/>a mocking retort. "That's all pedantry and innovation, no use<br/>listening to it," the monks decided. "We stick to the old doctrine;<br/>there are all sorts of innovations nowadays, are we to follow them<br/>all?" added others.<br/><br/>"We have had as many holy fathers as they had. There they are<br/>among the Turks, they have forgotten everything. Their doctrine has<br/>long been impure and they have no bells even, the most sneering<br/>added.<br/><br/>Father Iosif walked away, grieving the more since he had put<br/>forward his own opinion with little confidence as though scarcely<br/>believing in it himself. He foresaw with distress that something<br/>very unseemly was beginning and that there were positive signs of<br/>disobedience. Little by little, all the sensible monks were reduced<br/>to silence like Father Iosif. And so it came to pass that all who<br/>loved the elder and had accepted with devout obedience the<br/>institution of the eldership were all at once terribly cast down<br/>and glanced timidly in one another's faces, when they met. Those<br/>who were hostile to the institution of elders, as a novelty, held<br/>up their heads proudly. "There was no smell of corruption from the<br/>late elder Varsonofy, but a sweet fragrance," they recalled<br/>malignantly. "But he gained that glory not because he was an elder,<br/>but because he was a holy man."<br/><br/>And this was followed by a shower of criticism and even blame of<br/>Father Zossima. "His teaching was false; he taught that life is a<br/>great joy and not a vale of tears," said some of the more<br/>unreasonable. "He followed the fashionable belief, he did not<br/>recognise material fire in hell," others, still more unreasonable,<br/>added. "He was not strict in fasting, allowed himself sweet things,<br/>ate cherry jam with his tea, ladies used to send it to him. Is it<br/>for a monk of strict rule to drink tea?" could be heard among some<br/>of the envious. "He sat in pride," the most malignant declared<br/>vindictively; "he considered himself a saint and he took it as his<br/>due when people knelt before him." "He abused the sacrament of<br/>confession," the fiercest opponents of the institution of elders<br/>added in a malicious whisper. And among these were some of the<br/>oldest monks, strictest in their devotion, genuine ascetics, who<br/>had kept silent during the life of the deceased elder, but now<br/>suddenly unsealed their lips. And this was terrible, for their<br/>words had great influence on young monks who were not yet firm in<br/>their convictions. The monk from Obdorsk heard all this<br/>attentively, heaving deep sighs and nodding his head. "Yes, clearly<br/>Father Ferapont was right in his judgment yesterday," and at that<br/>moment Father Ferapont himself made his appearance, as though on<br/>purpose to increase the confusion.<br/><br/>I have mentioned already that he rarely left his wooden cell by<br/>the apiary. He was seldom even seen at church and they overlooked<br/>this neglect on the ground of his craziness, and did not keep him<br/>to the rules binding on all the rest. But if the whole truth is to<br/>be told, they hardly had a choice about it. For it would have been<br/>discreditable to insist on burdening with the common regulations so<br/>great an ascetic, who prayed day and night (he even dropped asleep<br/>on his knees). If they had insisted, the monks would have said, "He<br/>is holier than all of us and he follows a rule harder than ours.<br/>And if he does not go to church, it's because he knows when he<br/>ought to; he has his own rule." It was to avoid the chance of these<br/>sinful murmurs that Father Ferapont was left in peace.<br/><br/>As everyone was aware, Father Ferapont particularly disliked<br/>Father Zossima. And now the news had reached him in his hut that<br/>"God's judgment is not the same as man's," and that something had<br/>happened which was "in excess of nature." It may well be supposed<br/>that among the first to run to him with the news was the monk from<br/>Obdorsk, who had visited him the evening before and left his cell<br/>terror-stricken.<br/>
