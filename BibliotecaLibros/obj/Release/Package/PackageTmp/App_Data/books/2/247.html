"Let him alone, Alyosha, my cherub; you see what he is, he is<br/>not a person for you to speak to. Mihail Osipovitch," she turned to<br/>Rakitin, "I meant to beg your pardon for being rude to you, but now<br/>I don't want to. Alyosha, come to me, sit down here." She beckoned<br/>to him with a happy smile. "That's right, sit here. Tell me," she<br/>took him by the hand and peeped into his face, smiling, "tell me,<br/>do I love that man or not? The man who wronged me, do I love him or<br/>not? Before you came, I lay here in the dark, asking my heart<br/>whether I loved him. Decide for me, Alyosha, the time has come, it<br/>shall be as you say. Am I to forgive him or not?"<br/><br/>"But you have forgiven him already," said Alyosha, smiling.<br/><br/>"Yes, I really have forgiven him," Grushenka murmured<br/>thoughtfully. "What an abject heart! To my abject heart!" She<br/>snatched up a glass from the table, emptied it at a gulp, lifted it<br/>in the air and flung it on the floor. The glass broke with a crash.<br/>A little cruel line came into her smile.<br/><br/>"Perhaps I haven't forgiven him, though," she said, with a sort<br/>of menace in her voice, and she dropped her eyes to the ground as<br/>though she were talking to herself. "Perhaps my heart is only<br/>getting ready to forgive. I shall struggle with my heart. You see,<br/>Alyosha, I've grown to love my tears in these five years… . Perhaps<br/>I only love my resentment, not him… "<br/><br/>"Well, I shouldn't care to be in his shoes," hissed Rakitin.<br/><br/>"Well, you won't be, Rakitin, you'll never be in his shoes. You<br/>shall black my shoes, Rakitin, that's the place you are fit for.<br/>You'll never get a woman like me… and he won't either, perhaps…<br/>"<br/><br/>"Won't he? Then why are you dressed up like that?" said Rakitin,<br/>with a venomous sneer.<br/><br/>"Don't taunt me with dressing up, Rakitin, you don't know all<br/>that is in my heart! If I choose to tear off my finery, I'll tear<br/>it off at once, this minute," she cried in a resonant voice. "You<br/>don't know what that finery is for, Rakitin! Perhaps I shall see<br/>him and say: 'Have you ever seen me look like this before?' He left<br/>me a thin, consumptive cry-baby of seventeen. I'll sit by him,<br/>fascinate him and work him up. 'Do you see what I am like now?'<br/>I'll say to him; 'well, and that's enough for you, my dear sir,<br/>there's many a slip twixt the cup and the lip! That may be what the<br/>finery is for, Rakitin." Grushenka finished with a malicious laugh.<br/>"I'm violent and resentful, Alyosha, I'll tear off my finery, I'll<br/>destroy my beauty, I'll scorch my face, slash it with a knife, and<br/>turn beggar. If I choose, I won't go anywhere now to see anyone. If<br/>I choose, I'll send Kuzma back all he has ever given me, to-morrow,<br/>and all his money and I'll go out charing for the rest of my life.<br/>You think I wouldn't do it, Rakitin, that I would not dare to do<br/>it? I would, I would, I could do it directly, only don't exasperate<br/>me… and I'll send him about his business, I'll snap my fingers in<br/>his face, he shall never see me again!"<br/><br/>She uttered the last words in an hysterical scream, but broke<br/>down again, hid her face in her hands, buried it in the pillow and<br/>shook with sobs.<br/><br/>Rakitin got up.<br/><br/>"It's time we were off," he said, "it's late, we shall be shut<br/>out of the monastery."<br/>
