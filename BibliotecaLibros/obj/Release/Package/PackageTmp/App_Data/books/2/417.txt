"Brat?"

"Yes, a brat. What is it to you if I'm late; if I'm late, you
may be sure I have good reason," muttered Agafya, busying herself
about the stove, without a trace of anger or displeasure in her
voice. She seemed quite pleased, in fact, to enjoy a skirmish with
her merry young master.

"Listen, you frivolous young woman," Krassotkin began, getting
up from the sofa, "can you swear by all you hold sacred in the
world and something else besides, that you will watch vigilantly
over the kids in my absence? I am going out."

"And what am I going to swear for?" laughed Agafya. "I shall
look after them without that."

"No, you must swear on your eternal salvation. Else I shan't
go."

"Well, don't then. What does it matter to me? It's cold out;
stay at home."

"Kids," Kolya turned to the children, "this woman will stay with
you till I come back or till your mother comes, for she ought to
have been back long ago. She will give you some lunch, too. You'll
give them something, Agafya, won't you?"

"That I can do."

"Good-bye, chickens, I go with my heart at rest. And you,
granny," he added gravely, in an undertone, as he passed Agafya, "I
hope you'll spare their tender years and not tell them any of your
old woman's nonsense about Katerina. Ici, Perezvon!"

"Get along with you!" retorted Agafya, really angry this time.
"Ridiculous boy! You want a whipping for saying such things, that's
what you want!"
