<br/>Alyosha noticed that many, almost all, went in to the elder for<br/>the first time with apprehension and uneasiness, but came out with<br/>bright and happy faces. Alyosha was particularly struck by the fact<br/>that Father Zossima was not at all stern. On the contrary, he was<br/>always almost gay. The monks used to say that he was more drawn to<br/>those who were more sinful, and the greater the sinner the more he<br/>loved him. There were, no doubt, up to the end of his life, among<br/>the monks some who hated and envied him, but they were few in<br/>number and they were silent, though among them were some of great<br/>dignity in the monastery, one, for instance, of the older monks<br/>distinguished for his strict keeping of fasts and vows of silence.<br/>But the majority were on Father Zossima's side and very many of<br/>them loved him with all their hearts, warmly and sincerely. Some<br/>were almost fanatically devoted to him, and declared, though not<br/>quite aloud, that he was a saint, that there could be no doubt of<br/>it, and, seeing that his end was near, they anticipated miracles<br/>and great glory to the monastery in the immediate future from his<br/>relics. Alyosha had unquestioning faith in the miraculous power of<br/>the elder, just as he had unquestioning faith in the story of the<br/>coffin that flew out of the church. He saw many who came with sick<br/>children or relatives and besought the elder to lay hands on them<br/>and to pray over them, return shortly after- some the next day-<br/>and, falling in tears at the elder's feet, thank him for healing<br/>their sick.<br/><br/>Whether they had really been healed or were simply better in the<br/>natural course of the disease was a question which did not exist<br/>for Alyosha, for he fully believed in the spiritual power of his<br/>teacher and rejoiced in his fame, in his glory, as though it were<br/>his own triumph. His heart throbbed, and he beamed, as it were, all<br/>over when the elder came out to the gates of the hermitage into the<br/>waiting crowd of pilgrims of the humbler class who had flocked from<br/>all parts of Russia on purpose to see the elder and obtain his<br/>blessing. They fell down before him, wept, kissed his feet, kissed<br/>the earth on which he stood, and wailed, while the women held up<br/>their children to him and brought him the sick "possessed with<br/>devils." The elder spoke to them, read a brief prayer over them,<br/>blessed them, and dismissed them. Of late he had become so weak<br/>through attacks of illness that he was sometimes unable to leave<br/>his cell, and the pilgrims waited for him to come out for several<br/>days. Alyosha did not wonder why they loved him so, why they fell<br/>down before him and wept with emotion merely at seeing his face.<br/>Oh! he understood that for the humble soul of the Russian peasant,<br/>worn out by grief and toil, and still more by the everlasting<br/>injustice and everlasting sin, his own and the world's, it was the<br/>greatest need and comfort to find someone or something holy to fall<br/>down before and worship.<br/><br/>"Among us there is sin, injustice, and temptation, but yet,<br/>somewhere on earth there is someone holy and exalted. He has the<br/>truth; he knows the truth; so it is not dead upon the earth; so it<br/>will come one day to us, too, and rule over all the earth according<br/>to the promise."<br/><br/>Alyosha knew that this was just how the people felt and even<br/>reasoned. He understood it, but that the elder Zossima was this<br/>saint and custodian of God's truth- of that he had no more doubt<br/>than the weeping peasants and the sick women who held out their<br/>children to the elder. The conviction that after his death the<br/>elder would bring extraordinary glory to the monastery was even<br/>stronger in Alyosha than in anyone there, and, of late, a kind of<br/>deep flame of inner ecstasy burnt more and more strongly in his<br/>heart. He was not at all troubled at this elder's standing as a<br/>solitary example before him.<br/><br/>"No matter. He is holy. He carries in his heart the secret of<br/>renewal for all: that power which will, at last, establish truth on<br/>the earth, and all men will be holy and love one another, and there<br/>will be no more rich nor poor, no exalted nor humbled, but all will<br/>be as the children of God, and the true Kingdom of Christ will<br/>come." That was the dream in Alyosha's heart.<br/><br/>The arrival of his two brothers, whom he had not known till<br/>then, seemed to make a great impression on Alyosha. He more quickly<br/>made friends with his half-brother Dmitri (though he arrived later)<br/>than with his own brother Ivan. He was extremely interested in his<br/>brother Ivan, but when the latter had been two months in the town,<br/>though they had met fairly often, they were still not intimate.<br/>Alyosha was naturally silent, and he seemed to be expecting<br/>something, ashamed about something, while his brother Ivan, though<br/>Alyosha noticed at first that he looked long and curiously at him,<br/>seemed soon to have left off thinking of him. Alyosha noticed it<br/>with some embarrassment. He ascribed his brother's indifference at<br/>first to the disparity of their age and education. But he also<br/>wondered whether the absence of curiosity and sympathy in Ivan<br/>might be due to some other cause entirely unknown to him. He kept<br/>fancying that Ivan was absorbed in something- something inward and<br/>important- that he was striving towards some goal, perhaps very<br/>hard to attain, and that that was why he had no thought for him.<br/>Alyosha wondered, too, whether there was not some contempt on the<br/>part of the learned atheist for him- a foolish novice. He knew for<br/>certain that his brother was an atheist. He could not take offence<br/>at this contempt, if it existed; yet, with an uneasy embarrassment<br/>which he did not himself understand, he waited for his brother to<br/>come nearer to him. Dmitri used to speak of Ivan with the deepest<br/>respect and with a peculiar earnestness. From him Alyosha learnt<br/>all the details of the important affair which had of late formed<br/>such a close and remarkable bond between the two elder brothers.<br/>Dmitri's enthusiastic references to Ivan were the more striking in<br/>Alyosha's eyes since Dmitri was, compared with Ivan, almost<br/>uneducated, and the two brothers were such a contrast in<br/>personality and character that it would be difficult to find two<br/>men more unlike.<br/><br/>It was at this time that the meeting, or, rather gathering of<br/>the members of this inharmonious family took place in the cell of<br/>the elder who had such an extraordinary influence on Alyosha. The<br/>pretext for this gathering was a false one. It was at this time<br/>that the discord between Dmitri and his father seemed at its<br/>acutest stage and their relations had become insufferably strained.<br/>Fyodor Pavlovitch seems to have been the first to suggest,<br/>apparently in joke, that they should all meet in Father Zossima's<br/>cell, and that, without appealing to his direct intervention, they<br/>might more decently come to an understanding under the conciliating<br/>influence of the elder's presence. Dmitri, who had never seen the<br/>elder, naturally supposed that his father was trying to intimidate<br/>him, but, as he secretly blamed himself for his outbursts of temper<br/>with his father on several recent occasions, he accepted the<br/>challenge. It must be noted that he was not, like Ivan, staying<br/>with his father, but living apart at the other end of the town. It<br/>happened that Pyotr Alexandrovitch Miusov, who was staying in the<br/>district at the time, caught eagerly at the idea. A Liberal of the<br/>forties and fifties, a freethinker and atheist, he may have been<br/>led on by boredom or the hope of frivolous diversion. He was<br/>suddenly seized with the desire to see the monastery and the holy<br/>man. As his lawsuit with the monastery still dragged on, he made it<br/>the pretext for seeing the Superior, in order to attempt to settle<br/>it amicably. A visitor coming with such laudable intentions might<br/>be received with more attention and consideration than if he came<br/>from simple curiosity. Influences from within the monastery were<br/>brought to bear on the elder, who of late had scarcely left his<br/>cell, and had been forced by illness to deny even his ordinary<br/>visitors. In the end he consented to see them, and the day was<br/>fixed.<br/><br/>"Who has made me a judge over them?" was all he said, smilingly,<br/>to Alyosha.<br/><br/>Alyosha was much perturbed when he heard of the proposed visit.<br/>Of all the wrangling, quarrelsome party, Dmitri was the only one<br/>who could regard the interview seriously. All the others would come<br/>from frivolous motives, perhaps insulting to the elder. Alyosha was<br/>well aware of that. Ivan and Miusov would come from curiosity,<br/>perhaps of the coarsest kind, while his father might be<br/>contemplating some piece of buffoonery. Though he said nothing,<br/>Alyosha thoroughly understood his father. The boy, I repeat, was<br/>far from being so simple as everyone thought him. He awaited the<br/>day with a heavy heart. No doubt he was always pondering in his<br/>mind how the family discord could be ended. But his chief anxiety<br/>concerned the elder. He trembled for him, for his glory, and<br/>dreaded any affront to him, especially the refined, courteous irony<br/>of Miusov and the supercilious half-utterances of the highly<br/>educated Ivan. He even wanted to venture on warning the elder,<br/>telling him something about them, but, on second thoughts, said<br/>nothing. He only sent word the day before, through a friend, to his<br/>brother Dmitri, that he loved him and expected him to keep his<br/>promise. Dmitri wondered, for he could not remember what he had<br/>promised, but he answered by letter that he would do his utmost not<br/>to let himself be provoked "by vileness," but that, although he had<br/>a deep respect for the elder and for his brother Ivan, he was<br/>convinced that the meeting was either a trap for him or an unworthy<br/>farce.<br/><br/>"Nevertheless I would rather bite out my tongue than be lacking<br/>in respect to the sainted man whom you reverence so highly," he<br/>wrote in conclusion. Alyosha was not greatly cheered by the<br/>letter.<br/><br/>
