"No, I have no other proof."

The prosecutor dropped the examination at this point. The
impression left by Alyosha's evidence on the public was most
disappointing. There had been talk about Smerdyakov before the
trial; someone had heard something, someone had pointed out
something else, it was said that Alyosha had gathered together some
extraordinary proofs of his brother's innocence and Smerdyakov's
guilt, and after all there was nothing, no evidence except certain
moral convictions so natural in a brother.

But Fetyukovitch began his cross-examination. On his asking
Alyosha when it was that the prisoner had told him of his hatred
for his father and that he might kill him, and whether he had heard
it, for instance, at their last meeting before the catastrophe,
Alyosha started as he answered, as though only just recollecting
and understanding something.

"I remember one circumstance now which I'd quite forgotten
myself. It wasn't clear to me at the time, but now-"

And, obviously only now for the first time struck by an idea, he
recounted eagerly how, at his last interview with Mitya that
evening under the tree, on the road to the monastery, Mitya had
struck himself on the breast, "the upper part of the breast," and
had repeated several times that he had a means of regaining his
honour, that that means was here, here on his breast. "I thought,
when he struck himself on the breast, he meant that it was in his
heart," Alyosha continued, "that he might find in his heart
strength to save himself from some awful disgrace which was
awaiting him and which he did not dare confess even to me. I must
confess I did think at the time that he was speaking of our father,
and that the disgrace he was shuddering at was the thought of going
to our father and doing some violence to him. Yet it was just then
that he pointed to something on his breast, so that I remember the
idea struck me at the time that the heart is not on that part of
the breast, but below, and that he struck himself much too high,
just below the neck, and kept pointing to that place. My idea
seemed silly to me at the time, but he was perhaps pointing then to
that little bag in which he had fifteen hundred roubles!"

"Just so, Mitya cried from his place. "That's right, Alyosha, it
was the little bag I struck with my fist."

Fetyukovitch flew to him in hot haste entreating him to keep
quiet, and at the same instant pounced on Alyosha. Alyosha, carried
away himself by his recollection, warmly expressed his theory that
this disgrace was probably just that fifteen hundred roubles on
him, which he might have returned to Katerina Ivanovna as half of
what he owed her, but which he had yet determined not to repay her
and to use for another purpose- namely, to enable him to elope with
Grushenka, if she consented.

"It is so, it must be so," exclaimed Alyosha, in sudden
excitement. "My brother cried several times that half of the
disgrace, half of it (he said half several times) he could free
himself from at once, but that he was so unhappy in his weakness of
will that he wouldn't do it… that he knew beforehand he was
incapable of doing it!"

"And you clearly, confidently remember that he struck himself
just on this part of the breast?" Fetyukovitch asked eagerly.

"Clearly and confidently, for I thought at the time, 'Why does
he strike himself up there when the heart is lower down?' and the
thought seemed stupid to me at the time… I remember its seeming
stupid… it flashed through my mind. That's what brought it back to
me just now. How could I have forgotten it till now? It was that
little bag he meant when he said he had the means but wouldn't give
back that fifteen hundred. And when he was arrested at Mokroe he
cried out- I know, I was told it- that he considered it the most
disgraceful act of his life that when he had the means of repaying
Katerina Ivanovna half (half, note!) what he owed her, he yet could
not bring himself to repay the money and preferred to remain a
thief in her eyes rather than part with it. And what torture, what
torture that debt has been to him!" Alyosha exclaimed in
conclusion.

The prosecutor, of course, intervened. He asked Alyosha to
describe once more how it had all happened, and several times
insisted on the question, "Had the prisoner seemed to point to
anything? Perhaps he had simply struck himself with his fist on the
breast?"
