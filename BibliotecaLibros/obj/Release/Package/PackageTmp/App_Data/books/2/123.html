"Are your people expecting you, my son?"<br/><br/>Alyosha hesitated.<br/><br/>"Haven't they need of you? Didn't you promise someone yesterday<br/>to see them to-day?"<br/><br/>"I did promise- to my father- my brothers- others too."<br/><br/>"You see, you must go. Don't grieve. Be sure I shall not die<br/>without your being by to hear my last word. To you I will say that<br/>word, my son, it will be my last gift to you. To you, dear son,<br/>because you love me. But now go to keep your promise."<br/><br/>Alyosha immediately obeyed, though it was hard to go. But the<br/>promise that he should hear his last word on earth, that it should<br/>be the last gift to him, Alyosha, sent a thrill of rapture through<br/>his soul. He made haste that he might finish what he had to do in<br/>the town and return quickly. Father Paissy, too, uttered some words<br/>of exhortation which moved and surprised him greatly. He spoke as<br/>they left the cell together.<br/><br/>"Remember, young man, unceasingly," Father Paissy began, without<br/>preface, "that the science of this world, which has become a great<br/>power, has, especially in the last century, analysed everything<br/>divine handed down to us in the holy books. After this cruel<br/>analysis the learned of this world have nothing left of all that<br/>was sacred of old. But they have only analysed the parts and<br/>overlooked the whole, and indeed their blindness is marvellous. Yet<br/>the whole still stands steadfast before their eyes, and the gates<br/>of hell shall not prevail against it. Has it not lasted nineteen<br/>centuries, is it not still a living, a moving power in the<br/>individual soul and in the masses of people? It is still as strong<br/>and living even in the souls of atheists, who have destroyed<br/>everything! For even those who have renounced Christianity and<br/>attack it, in their inmost being still follow the Christian ideal,<br/>for hitherto neither their subtlety nor the ardour of their hearts<br/>has been able to create a higher ideal of man and of virtue than<br/>the ideal given by Christ of old. When it has been attempted, the<br/>result has been only grotesque. Remember this especially, young<br/>man, since you are being sent into the world by your departing<br/>elder. Maybe, remembering this great day, you will not forget my<br/>words, uttered from the heart for your guidance, seeing you are<br/>young, and the temptations of the world are great and beyond your<br/>strength to endure. Well, now go, my orphan."<br/><br/>With these words Father Paissy blessed him. As Alyosha left the<br/>monastery and thought them over, he suddenly realised that he had<br/>met a new and unexpected friend, a warmly loving teacher, in this<br/>austere monk who had hitherto treated him sternly. It was as though<br/>Father Zossima had bequeathed him to him at his death, and "perhaps<br/>that's just what had passed between them," Alyosha thought<br/>suddenly. The philosophic reflections he had just heard so<br/>unexpectedly testified to the warmth of Father Paissy's heart. He<br/>was in haste to arm the boy's mind for conflict with temptation and<br/>to guard the young soul left in his charge with the strongest<br/>defence he could imagine.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
