<br/>Indeed, not only his wife but the whole town were down upon me<br/>and blamed me. "It's all your doing," they said. I was silent and<br/>indeed rejoiced at heart, for I saw plainly God's mercy to the man<br/>who had turned against himself and punished himself. I could not<br/>believe in his insanity.<br/><br/>They let me see him at last. he insisted upon saying good-bye to<br/>me. I went in to him and saw at once, that not only his days, but<br/>his hours were numbered. He was weak, yellow, his hands trembled,<br/>he gasped for breath, but his face was full of tender and happy<br/>feeling.<br/><br/>"It is done!" he said. "I've long been yearning to see you. Why<br/>didn't you come?"<br/><br/>I did not tell him that they would not let me see him.<br/><br/>"God has had pity on me and is calling me to Himself. I know I<br/>am dying, but I feel joy and peace for the first time after so many<br/>years. There was heaven in my heart from the moment I had done what<br/>I had to do. Now I dare to love my children and to kiss them.<br/>Neither my wife nor the judges, nor anyone has believed it. My<br/>children will never believe it either. I see in that God's mercy to<br/>them. I shall die, and my name will be without a stain for them.<br/>And now I feel God near, my heart rejoices as in Heavenâ€¦ I have<br/>done my duty."<br/><br/>He could not speak, he gasped for breath, he pressed my hand<br/>warmly, looking fervently at me. We did not talk for long, his wife<br/>kept peeping in at us. But he had time to whisper to me:<br/><br/>"Do you remember how I came back to you that second time, at<br/>midnight? I told you to remember it. You know what I came back for?<br/>I came to kill you!"<br/><br/>I started.<br/><br/>"I went out from you then into the darkness, I wandered about<br/>the streets, struggling with myself. And suddenly I hated you so<br/>that I could hardly bear it. Now, I thought, he is all that binds<br/>me, and he is my judge. I can't refuse to face my punishment<br/>to-morrow, for he knows all. It was not that I was afraid you would<br/>betray me (I never even thought of that), but I thought, 'How can I<br/>look him in the face if I don't confess?' And if you had been at<br/>the other end of the earth, but alive, it would have been all the<br/>same, the thought was unendurable that you were alive knowing<br/>everything and condemning me. I hated you as though you were the<br/>cause, as though you were to blame for everything. I came back to<br/>you then, remembering that you had a dagger lying on your table. I<br/>sat down and asked you to sit down, and for a whole minute I<br/>pondered. If I had killed you, I should have been ruined by that<br/>murder even if I had not confessed the other. But I didn't think<br/>about that at all, and I didn't want to think of it at that moment.<br/>I only hated you and longed to revenge myself on you for<br/>everything. The Lord vanquished the devil in my heart. But let me<br/>tell you, you were never nearer death."<br/><br/>A week later he died. The whole town followed him to the grave.<br/>The chief priest made a speech full of feeling. All lamented the<br/>terrible illness that had cut short his days. But all the town was<br/>up in arms against me after the funeral, and people even refused to<br/>see me. Some, at first a few and afterwards more, began indeed to<br/>believe in the truth of his story, and they visited me and<br/>questioned me with great interest and eagerness, for man loves to<br/>see the downfall and disgrace of the righteous. But I held my<br/>tongue, and very shortly after, I left the town, and five months<br/>later by God's grace I entered the safe and blessed path, praising<br/>the unseen finger which had guided me so clearly to it. But I<br/>remember in my prayer to this day, the servant of God, Mihail, who<br/>suffered so greatly.<br/><br/>
