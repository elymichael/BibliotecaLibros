<br/>Mitya uttered his sudden monologue as though he were determined<br/>to be absolutely silent for the future. The prosecutor watched him<br/>the whole time and only when he had ceased speaking, observed, as<br/>though it were the most ordinary thing, with the most frigid and<br/>composed air:<br/><br/>"Oh, about the open door of which you spoke just now, we may as<br/>well inform you, by the way, now, of a very interesting piece of<br/>evidence of the greatest importance both to you and to us, that has<br/>been given us by Grigory, the old man you wounded. On his recovery,<br/>he clearly and emphatically stated, in reply to our questions, that<br/>when, on coming out to the steps, and hearing a noise in the<br/>garden, he made up his mind to go into it through the little gate<br/>which stood open, before he noticed you running, as you have told<br/>us already, in the dark from the open window where you saw your<br/>father, he, Grigory, glanced to the left, and, while noticing the<br/>open window, observed at the same time, much nearer to him, the<br/>door, standing wide open- that door which you have stated to have<br/>been shut the whole time you were in the garden. I will not conceal<br/>from you that Grigory himself confidently affirms and bears witness<br/>that you must have run from that door, though, of course, he did<br/>not see you do so with his own eyes, since he only noticed you<br/>first some distance away in the garden, running towards the<br/>fence."<br/><br/>Mitya had leapt up from his chair half-way through this<br/>speech.<br/><br/>"Nonsense!" he yelled, in a sudden frenzy, "it's a barefaced<br/>lie. He couldn't have seen the door open because it was shut. He's<br/>lying!"<br/><br/>"I consider it my duty to repeat that he is firm in his<br/>statement. He does not waver. He adheres to it. We've<br/>cross-examined him several times."<br/><br/>"Precisely. I have cross-examined him several times," Nikolay<br/>Parfenovitch confirmed warmly.<br/><br/>"It's false, false! It's either an attempt to slander me, or the<br/>hallucination of a madman," Mitya still shouted. "He's simply<br/>raving, from loss of blood, from the wound. He must have fancied it<br/>when he came to… . He's raving."<br/><br/>"Yes, but he noticed the open door, not when he came to after<br/>his injuries, but before that, as soon as he went into the garden<br/>from the lodge."<br/><br/>"But it's false, it's false! It can't be so! He's slandering me<br/>from spite… . He couldn't have seen it… I didn't come from the<br/>door," gasped Mitya.<br/><br/>The prosecutor turned to Nikolay Parfenovitch and said to him<br/>impressively:<br/><br/>
