"I am going away to Moscow to-morrow, if you care to know- early<br/>to-morrow morning. That's all!" he suddenly said aloud angrily, and<br/>wondered himself afterwards what need there was to say this then to<br/>Smerdyakov.<br/><br/>"That's the best thing you can do," he responded, as though he<br/>had expected to hear it; "except that you can always be telegraphed<br/>for from Moscow, if anything should happen here."<br/><br/>Ivan stopped again, and again turned quickly to Smerdyakov. But<br/>a change had passed over him, too. All his familiarity and<br/>carelessnes had completely disappeared. His face expressed<br/>attention and expectation, intent but timid and cringing.<br/><br/>"Haven't you something more to say- something to add?" could be<br/>read in the intent gaze he fixed on Ivan.<br/><br/>"And couldn't I be sent for from Tchermashnya, too- in case<br/>anything happened?" Ivan shouted suddenly, for some unknown reason<br/>raising his voice.<br/><br/>"From Tchermashnya, too… you could be sent for," Smerdyakov<br/>muttered, almost in a whisper, looking disconcerted, but gazing<br/>intently into Ivan's eyes.<br/><br/>"Only Moscow is farther and Tchermashnya is nearer. Is it to<br/>save my spending money on the fare, or to save my going so far out<br/>of my way, that you insist on Tchermashnya?"<br/><br/>"Precisely so… " muttered Smerdyakov, with a breaking voice. He<br/>looked at Ivan with a revolting smile, and again made ready to draw<br/>back. But to his astonishment Ivan broke into a laugh, and went<br/>through the gate still laughing. Anyone who had seen his face at<br/>that moment would have known that he was not laughing from<br/>lightness of heart, and he could not have explained himself what he<br/>was feeling at that instant. He moved and walked as though in a<br/>nervous frenzy.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
