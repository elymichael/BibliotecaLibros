<br/>"Were you very anxious to see me, then?"<br/><br/>"Very. I want to get to know you once for all, and I want you to<br/>know me. And then to say good-bye. I believe it's always best to<br/>get to know people just before leaving them. I've noticed how<br/>you've been looking at me these three months. There has been a<br/>continual look of expectation in your eyes, and I can't endure<br/>that. That's how it is I've kept away from you. But in the end I<br/>have learned to respect you. The little man stands firm, I thought.<br/>Though I am laughing, I am serious. You do stand firm, don't you? I<br/>like people who are firm like that whatever it is they stand by,<br/>even if they are such little fellows as you. Your expectant eyes<br/>ceased to annoy me, I grew fond of them in the end, those expectant<br/>eyes. You seem to love me for some reason, Alyosha?"<br/><br/>"I do love you, Ivan. Dmitri says of you- Ivan is a tomb! I say<br/>of you, Ivan is a riddle. You are a riddle to me even now. But I<br/>understand something in you, and I did not understand it till this<br/>morning."<br/><br/>"What's that?" laughed Ivan.<br/><br/>"You won't be angry?" Alyosha laughed too.<br/><br/>"Well?"<br/><br/>"That you are just as young as other young men of three and<br/>twenty, that you are just a young and fresh and nice boy, green in<br/>fact! Now, have I insulted you dreadfully?"<br/><br/>"On the contrary, I am struck by a coincidence," cried Ivan,<br/>warmly and good-humouredly. "Would you believe it that ever since<br/>that scene with her, I have thought of nothing else but my youthful<br/>greenness, and just as though you guessed that, you begin about it.<br/>Do you know I've been sitting here thinking to myself: that if I<br/>didn't believe in life, if I lost faith in the woman I love, lost<br/>faith in the order of things, were convinced, in fact, that<br/>everything is a disorderly, damnable, and perhaps devil-ridden<br/>chaos, if I were struck by every horror of man's disillusionment-<br/>still I should want to live and, having once tasted of the cup, I<br/>would not turn away from it till I had drained it! At thirty,<br/>though, I shall be sure to leave the cup, even if I've not emptied<br/>it, and turn away- where I don't know. But till I am thirty, I know<br/>that my youth will triumph over everything- every disillusionment,<br/>every disgust with life. I've asked myself many times whether there<br/>is in the world any despair that would overcome this frantic and<br/>perhaps unseemly thirst for life in me, and I've come to the<br/>conclusion that there isn't, that is till I am thirty, and then I<br/>shall lose it of myself, I fancy. Some drivelling consumptive<br/>moralists- and poets especially- often call that thirst for life<br/>base. It's a feature of the Karamazovs, it's true, that thirst for<br/>life regardless of everything; you have it no doubt too, but why is<br/>it base? The centripetal force on our planet is still fearfully<br/>strong, Alyosha. I have a longing for life, and I go on living in<br/>spite of logic. Though I may not believe in the order of the<br/>universe, yet I love the sticky little leaves as they open in<br/>spring. I love the blue sky, I love some people, whom one loves you<br/>know sometimes without knowing why. I love some great deeds done by<br/>men, though I've long ceased perhaps to have faith in them, yet<br/>from old habit one's heart prizes them. Here they have brought the<br/>soup for you, eat it, it will do you good. It's first-rate soup,<br/>they know how to make it here. I want to travel in Europe, Alyosha,<br/>I shall set off from here. And yet I know that I am only going to a<br/>graveyard, but it's a most precious graveyard, that's what it is!<br/>Precious are the dead that lie there, every stone over them speaks<br/>of such burning life in the past, of such passionate faith in their<br/>work, their truth, their struggle and their science, that I know I<br/>shall fall on the ground and kiss those stones and weep over them;<br/>though I'm convinced in my heart that it's long been nothing but a<br/>graveyard. And I shall not weep from despair, but simply because I<br/>shall be happy in my tears, I shall steep my soul in emotion. I<br/>love the sticky leaves in spring, the blue sky- that's all it is.<br/>It's not a matter of intellect or logic, it's loving with one's<br/>inside, with one's stomach. One loves the first strength of one's<br/>youth. Do you understand anything of my tirade, Alyosha?" Ivan<br/>laughed suddenly.<br/><br/>"I understand too well, Ivan. One longs to love with one's<br/>inside, with one's stomach. You said that so well and I am awfully<br/>glad that you have such a longing for life," cried Alyosha. "I<br/>think everyone should love life above everything in the world."<br/><br/>"Love life more than the meaning of it?"<br/><br/>
