"Not at all, I can go quite well," said Alyosha.<br/><br/>"What! You are going away? Is that what you say?"<br/><br/>"Well, when I've seen them, I'll come back here and we can talk<br/>as much as you like. But I should like to see Katerina Ivanovna at<br/>once, for I am very anxious to be back at the monastery as soon as<br/>I can."<br/><br/>"Mamma, take him away quickly. Alexey Fyodorovitch, don't<br/>trouble to come and see me afterwards, but go straight back to your<br/>monastery and a good riddance. I want to sleep, I didn't sleep all<br/>night."<br/><br/>"Ah, Lise, you are only making fun, but how I wish you would<br/>sleep!" cried Madame Hohlakov.<br/><br/>"I don't know what I've doneâ€¦ . I'll stay another three minutes,<br/>five if you like," muttered Alyosha.<br/><br/>"Even five! Do take him away quickly, mamma, he is a<br/>monster."<br/><br/>"Lise, you are crazy. Let us go, Alexey Fyodorovitch, she is too<br/>capricious to-day. I am afraid to cross her. Oh, the trouble one<br/>has with nervous girls! Perhaps she really will be able to sleep<br/>after seeing you. How quickly you have made her sleepy, and how<br/>fortunate it is!"<br/><br/>"Ah, mamma, how sweetly you talk! I must kiss you for it,<br/>mamma."<br/><br/>"And I kiss you too, Lise. Listen, Alexey Fyodorovitch," Madame<br/>Hohlakov began mysteriously and importantly, speaking in a rapid<br/>whisper. "I don't want to suggest anything, I don't want to lift<br/>the veil, you will see for yourself what's going on. It's<br/>appalling. It's the most fantastic farce. She loves your brother,<br/>Ivan, and she is doing her utmost to persuade herself she loves<br/>your brother, Dmitri. It's appalling! I'll go in with you, and if<br/>they don't turn me out, I'll stay to the end."<br/><br/><br/>
