<br/>While I was still wearing an officer's uniform after my duel, I<br/>talked about servants in general society, and I remember everyone<br/>was amazed at me. "What!" they asked, "are we to make our servants<br/>sit down on the sofa and offer them tea?" And I answered them: "Why<br/>not, sometimes at least?" Everyone laughed. Their question was<br/>frivolous and my answer was not clear; but the thought in it was to<br/>some extent right.<br/><br/>(g) Of Prayer, of Love, and of Contact with other Worlds.<br/><br/>Young man, be not forgetful of prayer. Every time you pray, if<br/>your prayer is sincere, there will be new feeling and new meaning<br/>in it, which will give you fresh courage, and you will understand<br/>that prayer is an education. Remember, too, every day, and whenever<br/>you can, repeat to yourself, "Lord, have mercy on all who appear<br/>before Thee to-day." For every hour and every moment thousands of<br/>men leave life on this earth, and their souls appear before God.<br/>And how many of them depart in solitude, unknown, sad, dejected<br/>that no one mourns for them or even knows whether they have lived<br/>or not! And behold, from the other end of the earth perhaps, your<br/>prayer for their rest will rise up to God though you knew them not<br/>nor they you. How touching it must be to a soul standing in dread<br/>before the Lord to feel at that instant that, for him too, there is<br/>one to pray, that there is a fellow creature left on earth to love<br/>him too! And God will look on you both more graciously, for if you<br/>have had so much pity on him, how much will He have pity Who is<br/>infinitely more loving and merciful than you! And He will forgive<br/>him for your sake.<br/><br/>Brothers, have no fear of men's sin. Love a man even in his sin,<br/>for that is the semblance of Divine Love and is the highest love on<br/>earth. Love all God's creation, the whole and every grain of sand<br/>in it. Love every leaf, every ray of God's light. Love the animals,<br/>love the plants, love everything. If you love everything, you will<br/>perceive the divine mystery in things. Once you perceive it, you<br/>will begin to comprehend it better every day. And you will come at<br/>last to love the whole world with an all-embracing love. Love the<br/>animals: God has given them the rudiments of thought and joy<br/>untroubled. Do not trouble it, don't harass them, don't deprive<br/>them of their happiness, don't work against God's intent. Man, do<br/>not pride yourself on superiority to the animals; they are without<br/>sin, and you, with your greatness, defile the earth by your<br/>appearance on it, and leave the traces of your foulness after you-<br/>alas, it is true of almost every one of us! Love children<br/>especially, for they too are sinless like the angels; they live to<br/>soften and purify our hearts and, as it were, to guide us. Woe to<br/>him who offends a child! Father Anfim taught me to love children.<br/>The kind, silent man used often on our wanderings to spend the<br/>farthings given us on sweets and cakes for the children. He could<br/>not pass by a child without emotion. That's the nature of the<br/>man.<br/><br/>At some thoughts one stands perplexed, especially at the sight<br/>of men's sin, and wonders whether one should use force or humble<br/>love. Always decide to use humble love. If you resolve on that once<br/>for all, you may subdue the whole world. Loving humility is<br/>marvellously strong, the strongest of all things, and there is<br/>nothing else like it.<br/><br/>Every day and every hour, every minute, walk round yourself and<br/>watch yourself, and see that your image is a seemly one. You pass<br/>by a little child, you pass by, spiteful, with ugly words, with<br/>wrathful heart; you may not have noticed the child, but he has seen<br/>you, and your image, unseemly and ignoble, may remain in his<br/>defenceless heart. You don't know it, but you may have sown an evil<br/>seed in him and it may grow, and all because you were not careful<br/>before the child, because you did not foster in yourself a careful,<br/>actively benevolent love. Brothers, love is a teacher; but one must<br/>know how to acquire it, for it is hard to acquire, it is dearly<br/>bought, it is won slowly by long labour. For we must love not only<br/>occasionally, for a moment, but for ever. Everyone can love<br/>occasionally, even the wicked can.<br/><br/>My brother asked the birds to forgive him; that sounds<br/>senseless, but it is right; for all is like an ocean, all is<br/>flowing and blending; a touch in one place sets up movement at the<br/>other end of the earth. It may be senseless to beg forgiveness of<br/>the birds, but birds would be happier at your side- a little<br/>happier, anyway- and children and all animals, if you were nobler<br/>than you are now. It's all like an ocean, I tell you. Then you<br/>would pray to the birds too, consumed by an all-embracing love, in<br/>a sort of transport, and pray that they too will forgive you your<br/>sin. Treasure this ecstasy, however senseless it may seem to<br/>men.<br/><br/>My friends, pray to God for gladness. Be glad as children, as<br/>the birds of heaven. And let not the sin of men confound you in<br/>your doings. Fear not that it will wear away your work and hinder<br/>its being accomplished. Do not say, "Sin is mighty, wickedness is<br/>mighty, evil environment is mighty, and we are lonely and helpless,<br/>and evil environment is wearing us away and hindering our good work<br/>from being done." Fly from that dejection, children! There is only<br/>one means of salvation, then take yourself and make yourself<br/>responsible for all men's sins, that is the truth, you know,<br/>friends, for as soon as you sincerely make yourself responsible for<br/>everything and for all men, you will see at once that it is really<br/>so, and that you are to blame for everyone and for all things. But<br/>throwing your own indolence and impotence on others you will end by<br/>sharing the pride of Satan and murmuring against God.<br/><br/>Of the pride of Satan what I think is this: it is hard for us on<br/>earth to comprehend it, and therefore it is so easy to fall into<br/>error and to share it, even imagining that we are doing something<br/>grand and fine. Indeed, many of the strongest feelings and<br/>movements of our nature we cannot comprehend on earth. Let not that<br/>be a stumbling-block, and think not that it may serve as a<br/>justification to you for anything. For the Eternal judge asks of<br/>you what you can comprehend and not what you cannot. You will know<br/>that yourself hereafter, for you will behold all things truly then<br/>and will not dispute them. On earth, indeed, we are, as it were,<br/>astray, and if it were not for the precious image of Christ before<br/>us, we should be undone and altogether lost, as was the human race<br/>before the flood. Much on earth is hidden from us, but to make up<br/>for that we have been given a precious mystic sense of our living<br/>bond with the other world, with the higher heavenly world, and the<br/>roots of our thoughts and feelings are not here but in other<br/>worlds. That is why the philosophers say that we cannot apprehend<br/>the reality of things on earth.<br/><br/>God took seeds from different worlds and sowed them on this<br/>earth, and His garden grew up and everything came up that could<br/>come up, but what grows lives and is alive only through the feeling<br/>of its contact with other mysterious worlds. If that feeling grows<br/>weak or is destroyed in you, the heavenly growth will die away in<br/>you. Then you will be indifferent to life and even grow to hate it.<br/>That's what I think.<br/><br/>
