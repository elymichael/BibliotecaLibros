<br/>"In a theatre? What? What do you mean?" exclaimed Katerina<br/>Ivanovna, profoundly astonished, flushing crimson, and<br/>frowning.<br/><br/>"Though you assure him you are sorry to lose a friend in him,<br/>you persist in telling him to his face that it's fortunate he is<br/>going," said Alyosha breathlessly. He was standing at the table and<br/>did not sit down.<br/><br/>"What are you talking about? I don't understand."<br/><br/>"I don't understand myself… . I seemed to see in a flash… I know<br/>I am not saying it properly, but I'll say it all the same," Alyosha<br/>went on in the same shaking and broken voice. "What I see is that<br/>perhaps you don't love Dmitri at all… and never have, from the<br/>beginning… . And Dmitri, too, has never loved you… and only esteems<br/>you… . I really don't know how I dare to say all this, but somebody<br/>must tell the truth… for nobody here will tell the truth."<br/><br/>"What truth?" cried Katerina Ivanovna,and there was an<br/>hysterical ring in her voice.<br/><br/>"I'll tell you," Alyosha went on with desperate haste, as though<br/>he were jumping from the top of a house. "Call Dmitri; I will fetch<br/>him and let him come here and take your hand and take Ivan's and<br/>join your hands. For you're torturing Ivan, simply because you love<br/>him- and torturing him, because you love Dmitri through<br/>'self-laceration'-with an unreal love- because you've persuaded<br/>yourself."<br/><br/>Alyosha broke off and was silent.<br/><br/>"You… you… you are a little religious idiot- that's what you<br/>are!" Katerina Ivanovna snapped. Her face was white and her lips<br/>were moving with anger.<br/><br/>Ivan suddenly laughed and got up. His hat was in his hand.<br/><br/>"You are mistaken, my good Alyosha," he said, with an expression<br/>Alyosha had never seen in his face before- an expression of<br/>youthful sincerity and strong, irresistibly frank feeling.<br/>"Katerina Ivanovna has never cared for me! She has known all the<br/>time that I cared for her- though I never said a word of my love to<br/>her- she knew, but she didn't care for me. I have never been her<br/>friend either, not for one moment; she is too proud to need my<br/>friendship. She kept me at her side as a means of revenge. She<br/>revenged with me and on me all the insults which she has been<br/>continually receiving from Dmitri ever since their first meeting.<br/>For even that first meeting has rankled in her heart as an insult-<br/>that's what her heart is like! She has talked to me of nothing but<br/>her love for him. I am going now; but, believe me, Katerina<br/>Ivanovna, you really love him. And the more he insults you, the<br/>more you love him- that's your 'laceration.' You love him just as<br/>he is; you love him for insulting you. If he reformed, you'd give<br/>him up at once and cease to love him. But you need him so as to<br/>contemplate continually your heroic fidelity and to reproach him<br/>for infidelity. And it all comes from your pride. Oh, there's a<br/>great deal of humiliation and self-abasement about it, but it all<br/>comes from pride… . I am too young and I've loved you too much. I<br/>know that I ought not to say this, that it would be more dignified<br/>on my part simply to leave you, and it would be less offensive for<br/>you. But I am going far away, and shall never come back… . It is<br/>for ever. I don't want to sit beside a 'laceration.'… But I don't<br/>know how to speak now. I've said everything… . Good-bye, Katerina<br/>Ivanovna; you can't be angry with me, for I am a hundred times more<br/>severely punished than you, if only by the fact that I shall never<br/>see you again. Good-bye! I don't want your hand. You have tortured<br/>me too deliberately for me to be able to forgive you at this<br/>moment. I shall forgive you later, but now I don't want your hand.<br/>Den Dank, Dame, begehr ich nicht,"<br/>[5]<br/>
