<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>5<br/>A<br/>Laceration in the Drawing-Room<br/><br/><br/>BUT in the drawing-room the conversation was already over.<br/>Katerina Ivanovna was greatly excited, though she looked resolute.<br/>At the moment Alyosha and Madame Hohlakov entered, Ivan<br/>Fyodorovitch stood up to take leave. His face was rather pale, and<br/>Alyosha looked at him anxiously. For this moment was to solve a<br/>doubt, a harassing enigma which had for some time haunted Alyosha.<br/>During the preceding month it had been several times suggested to<br/>him that his brother Ivan was in love with Katerina Ivanovna, and,<br/>what was more, that he meant "to carry her off from Dmitri. Until<br/>quite lately the idea seemed to Alyosha monstrous, though it<br/>worried him extremely. He loved both his brothers, and dreaded such<br/>rivalry between them. Meantime, Dmitri had said outright on the<br/>previous day that he was glad that Ivan was his rival, and that it<br/>was a great assistance to him, Dmitri. In what way did it assist<br/>him? To marry Grushenka? But that Alyosha considered the worst<br/>thing possible. Besides all this, Alyosha had till the evening<br/>before implicitly believed that Katerina Ivanovna had a steadfast<br/>and passionate love for Dmitri; but he had only believed it till<br/>the evening before. He had fancied, too, that she was incapable of<br/>loving a man like Ivan, and that she did love Dmitri, and loved him<br/>just as he was, in spite of all the strangeness of such a<br/>passion.<br/><br/>But during yesterday's scene with Grushenka another idea had<br/>struck him. The word "lacerating," which Madame Hohlakov had just<br/>uttered, almost made him start, because half waking up towards<br/>daybreak that night he had cried out "Laceration, laceration,"<br/>probably applying it to his dream. He had been dreaming all night<br/>of the previous day's scene at Katerina Ivanovna's. Now Alyosha was<br/>impressed by Madame Hohlakov's blunt and persistent assertion that<br/>Katerina Ivanovna was in love with Ivan, and only deceived herself<br/>through some sort of pose, from "self-laceration," and tortured<br/>herself by her pretended love for Dmitri from some fancied duty of<br/>gratitude. "Yes," he thought, "perhaps the whole truth lies in<br/>those words." But in that case what was Ivan's position? Alyosha<br/>felt instinctively that a character like Katerina Ivanovna's must<br/>dominate, and she could only dominate someone like Dmitri, and<br/>never a man like Ivan. For Dmitri might- at last submit to her<br/>domination "to his own happiness" (which was what Alyosha would<br/>have desired), but Ivan- no, Ivan could not submit to her, and such<br/>submission would not give him happiness. Alyosha could not help<br/>believing that of Ivan. And now all these doubts and reflections<br/>flitted through his mind as he entered the drawing-room. Another<br/>idea, too, forced itself upon him: "What if she loved neither of<br/>them- neither Ivan nor Dmitri?"<br/><br/>It must be noted that Alyosha felt as it were ashamed of his own<br/>thoughts and blamed himself when they kept recurring to him during<br/>the last month. "What do I know about love and women and how can I<br/>decide such questions?" he thought reproachfully, after such doubts<br/>and surmises. And yet it was impossible not to think about it. He<br/>felt instinctively that this rivalry was of immense importance in<br/>his brothers' lives and that a great deal depended upon it.<br/><br/>"One reptile will devour the other," Ivan had pronounced the day<br/>before, speaking in anger of his father and Dmitri. So Ivan looked<br/>upon Dmitri as a reptile, and perhaps long done so. Was it perhaps<br/>since he had known Katerina Ivanovna? That phrase had, of course,<br/>escaped Ivan unawares yesterday, but that only made it more<br/>important. If he felt like that, what chance was there of peace?<br/>Were there not, on the contrary, new grounds for hatred and<br/>hostility in their family? And with which of them was Alyosha to<br/>sympathise? And what was he to wish for each of them? He loved them<br/>both, but what could he desire for each in the midst of these<br/>conflicting interests? He might go quite astray in this maze, and<br/>Alyosha's heart could not endure uncertainty, because his love was<br/>always of an active character. He was incapable of passive love. If<br/>he loved anyone, he set to work at once to help him. And to do so<br/>he must know what he was aiming at; he must know for certain what<br/>was best for each, and having ascertained this it was natural for<br/>him to help them both. But instead of a definite aim, he found<br/>nothing but uncertainty and perplexity on all sides. "It was<br/>lacerating," as was said just now. But what could he understand<br/>even in this "laceration"? He did not understand the first word in<br/>this perplexing maze.<br/><br/>Seeing Alyosha, Katerina Ivanovna said quickly and joyfully to<br/>Ivan, who had already got up to go, "A minute! Stay another minute!<br/>I want to hear the opinion of this person here whom I trust<br/>absolutely. Don't go away," she added, addressing Madame Hohlakov.<br/>She made Alyosha sit down beside her, and Madame Hohlakov sat<br/>opposite, by Ivan.<br/><br/>"You are all my friends here, all I have in the world, dear<br/>friends," she warmly, in a voice which quivered with genuine tears<br/>of suffering, and Alyosha's heart warmed to her at once. "You,<br/>Alexey Fyodorovitch, were witness yesterday of that abominable<br/>scene, and saw what I did. You did not see it, Ivan Fyodorovitch,<br/>he did. What he thought of me yesterday I don't know. I only know<br/>one thing, that if it were repeated to-day, this minute, I should<br/>express the same feelings again as yesterday- the same feelings,<br/>the same words, the same actions. You remember my actions, Alexey<br/>Fyodorovitch; you checked me in one of them"â€¦ (as she said that,<br/>she flushed and her eyes shone). "I must tell you that I can't get<br/>over it. Listen, Alexey Fyodorovitch. I don't even know whether I<br/>still love him. I feel pity for him, and that is a poor sign of<br/>love. If I loved him, if I still loved him, perhaps I shouldn't be<br/>sorry for him now, but should hate him"<br/><br/>.Her voice quivered and tears glittered on her eyelashes.<br/>Alyosha shuddered inwardly. "That girl is truthful and sincere," he<br/>thought, "and she does not love Dmitri any more."<br/>
