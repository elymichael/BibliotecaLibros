<br/>He said this with almost hostile feeling. At the same time he<br/>got up and looked anxiously in the looking-glass (perhaps for the<br/>fortieth time that morning) at his nose. He began, too, binding his<br/>red handkerchief more becomingly on his forehead.<br/><br/>"Red's better. It's just like the hospital in a white one," he<br/>observed sententiously. "Well, how are things over there? How is<br/>your elder?"<br/><br/>"He is very bad; he may die to-day," answered Alyosha. But his<br/>father had not listened, and had forgotten his own question at<br/>once.<br/><br/>"Ivan's gone out," he said suddenly. "He is doing his utmost to<br/>carry off Mitya's betrothed. That's what he is staying here for,"<br/>he added maliciously, and, twisting his mouth, looked at<br/>Alyosha.<br/><br/>"Surely he did not tell you so?" asked Alyosha.<br/><br/>"Yes, he did, long ago. Would you believe it, he told me three<br/>weeks ago? You don't suppose he too came to murder me, do you? He<br/>must have had some object in coming."<br/><br/>"What do you mean? Why do you say such things?" said Alyosha,<br/>troubled.<br/><br/>"He doesn't ask for money, it's true, but yet he won't get a<br/>farthing from me. I intend living as long as possible, you may as<br/>well know, my dear Alexey Fyodorovitch, and so I need every<br/>farthing, and the longer I live, the more I shall need it," he<br/>continued, pacing from one corner of the room to the other, keeping<br/>his hands in the pockets of his loose greasy overcoat made of<br/>yellow cotton material. "I can still pass for a man at five and<br/>fifty, but I want to pass for one for another twenty years. As I<br/>get older, you know, I shan't be a pretty object. The wenches won't<br/>come to me of their own accord, so I shall want my money. So I am<br/>saving up more and more, simply for myself, my dear son Alexey<br/>Fyodorovitch. You may as well know. For I mean to go on in my sins<br/>to the end, let me tell you. For sin is sweet; all abuse it, but<br/>all men live in it, only others do it on the sly, and I openly. And<br/>so all the other sinners fall upon me for being so simple. And your<br/>paradise, Alexey Fyodorovitch, is not to my taste, let me tell you<br/>that; and it's not the proper place for a gentleman, your paradise,<br/>even if it exists. I believe that I fall asleep and don't wake up<br/>again, and that's all. You can pray for my soul if you like. And if<br/>you don't want to, don't, damn you! That's my philosophy. Ivan<br/>talked well here yesterday, though we were all drunk. Ivan is a<br/>conceited coxcomb, but he has no particular learningâ€¦ nor education<br/>either. He sits silent and smiles at one without speaking- that's<br/>what pulls him through."<br/><br/>Alyosha listened to him in silence.<br/><br/>"Why won't he talk to me? If he does speak, he gives himself<br/>airs. Your Ivan is a scoundrel! And I'll marry Grushenka in a<br/>minute if I want to. For if you've money, Alexey Fyodorovitch, you<br/>have only to want a thing and you can have it. That's what Ivan is<br/>afraid of, he is on the watch to prevent me getting married and<br/>that's why he is egging on Mitya to marry Grushenka himself. He<br/>hopes to keep me from Grushenka by that (as though I should leave<br/>him my money if I don't marry her!). Besides if Mitya marries<br/>Grushenka, Ivan will carry off his rich betrothed, that's what he's<br/>reckoning on! He is a scoundrel, your Ivan!"<br/><br/>
