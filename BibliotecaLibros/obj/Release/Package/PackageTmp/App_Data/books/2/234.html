"I believed, I believe, I want to believe, and I will believe,<br/>what more do you want?" cried Alyosha irritably.<br/><br/>"Nothing at all, my boy. Damn it all! why, no schoolboy of<br/>thirteen believes in that now. But there… So now you are in a<br/>temper with your God, you are rebelling against Him; He hasn't<br/>given promotion, He hasn't bestowed the order of merit! Eh, you are<br/>a set!"<br/><br/>Alyosha gazed a long while with his eyes half closed at Rakitin,<br/>and there was a sudden gleam in his eyes… but not of anger with<br/>Rakitin.<br/><br/>"I am not rebelling against my God; I simply 'don't accept His<br/>world.'" Alyosha suddenly smiled a forced smile.<br/><br/>"How do you mean, you don't accept the world?" Rakitin thought a<br/>moment over his answer. "What idiocy is this?"<br/><br/>Alyosha did not answer.<br/><br/>"Come, enough nonsense, now to business. Have you had anything<br/>to eat to-day?"<br/><br/>"I don't remember… . I think I have."<br/><br/>"You need keeping up, to judge by your face. It makes one sorry<br/>to look at you. You didn't sleep all night either, I hear; you had<br/>a meeting in there. And then all this bobbery afterwards. Most<br/>likely you've had nothing to eat but a mouthful of holy bread. I've<br/>got some sausage in my pocket; I've brought it from the town in<br/>case of need, only you won't eat sausage… ."<br/><br/>"Give me some."<br/><br/>"I say! You are going it! Why, it's a regular mutiny, with<br/>barricades! Well, my boy, we must make the most of it. Come to my<br/>place… shouldn't mind a drop of vodka myself, I am tired to death.<br/>Vodka is going too far for you, I suppose… or would you like<br/>some?"<br/>
