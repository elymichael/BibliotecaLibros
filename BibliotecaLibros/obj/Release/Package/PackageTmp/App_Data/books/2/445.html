"Ah! I heard about the goose!" Ilusha laughed, beaming all over.<br/>"They told me, but I didn't understand. Did they really take you to<br/>the court?"<br/><br/>"The most stupid, trivial affair, they made a mountain of a<br/>mole-hill as they always do," Kolya began carelessly. "I was<br/>walking through the market-place here one day, just when they'd<br/>driven in the geese. I stopped and looked at them. All at once a<br/>fellow, who is an errand-boy at Plotnikov's now, looked at me and<br/>said, 'What are you looking at the geese for?' I looked at him; he<br/>was a stupid, moon-faced fellow of twenty. I am always on the side<br/>of the peasantry, you know. I like talking to the peasants… . We've<br/>dropped behind the peasants that's an axiom. I believe you are<br/>laughing, Karamazov?"<br/><br/>"No, Heaven forbid, I am listening," said Alyosha with a most<br/>good-natured air, and the sensitive Kolya was immediately<br/>reassured."<br/><br/>"My theory, Karamazov, is clear and simple," he hurried on<br/>again, looking pleased. "I believe in the people and am always glad<br/>to give them their due, but I am not for spoiling them, that is a<br/>sine qua non… But I was telling you about the goose. So I turned to<br/>the fool and answered, 'I am wondering what the goose thinks<br/>about.' He looked at me quite stupidly, 'And what does the goose<br/>think about?' he asked. 'Do you see that cart full of oats?'I said.<br/>'The oats are dropping out of the sack, and the goose has put its<br/>neck right under the wheel to gobble them up- do you see?' 'I see<br/>that quite well,' he said. 'Well,' said I, 'if that cart were to<br/>move on a little, would it break the goose's neck or not?' 'It'd be<br/>sure to break it,' and he grinned all over his face, highly<br/>delighted. 'Come on, then,' said I, 'let's try.' 'Let's,' he said.<br/>And it did not take us long to arrange: he stood at the bridle<br/>without being noticed, and I stood on one side to direct the goose.<br/>And the owner wasn't looking, he was talking to someone, so I had<br/>nothing to do, the goose thrust its head in after the oats of<br/>itself, under the cart, just under the wheel. I winked at the lad,<br/>he tugged at the bridle, and crack. The goose's neck was broken in<br/>half. And, as luck would have it, all the peasants saw us at that<br/>moment and they kicked up a shindy at once. 'You did that on<br/>purpose!' 'No, not on purpose.' 'Yes, you did, on purpose!' Well,<br/>they shouted, 'Take him to the justice of the peace!' They took me,<br/>too. 'You were there, too,' they said, 'you helped, you're known<br/>all over the market!' And, for some reason, I really am known all<br/>over the market," Kolya added conceitedly. "We all went off to the<br/>justice's, they brought the goose, too. The fellow was crying in a<br/>great funk, simply blubbering like a woman. And the farmer kept<br/>shouting that you could kill any number of geese like that. Well,<br/>of course, there were witnesses. The justice of the peace settled<br/>it in a minute, that the farmer was to be paid a rouble for the<br/>goose, and the fellow to have the goose. And he was warned not to<br/>play such pranks again. And the fellow kept blubbering like a<br/>woman. 'It wasn't me,' he said, 'it was he egged me on,' and he<br/>pointed to me. I answered with the utmost composure that I hadn't<br/>egged him on, that I simply stated the general proposition, had<br/>spoken hypothetically. The justice of the peace smiled and was<br/>vexed with himself once for having smiled. 'I'll complain to your<br/>masters of you, so that for the future you mayn't waste your time<br/>on such general propositions, instead of sitting at your books and<br/>learning your lessons.' He didn't complain to the masters, that was<br/>a joke, but the matter noised abroad and came to the ears of the<br/>masters. Their ears are long, you know! The classical master,<br/>Kolbasnikov, was particularly shocked about it, but Dardanelov got<br/>me off again. But Kolbasnikov is savage with everyone now like a<br/>green ass. Did you know, Ilusha, he is just married, got a dowry of<br/>a thousand roubles, and his bride's a regular fright of the first<br/>rank and the last degree. The third-class fellows wrote an epigram<br/>on it:<br/><br/>Astounding news has reached the class,<br/><br/>Kolbasnikov has been an ass.<br/><br/>And so on, awfully funny, I'll bring it to you later on. I say<br/>nothing against Dardanelov, he is a learned man, there's no doubt<br/>about it. I respect men like that and it's not because he stood up<br/>for me."<br/><br/>"But you took him down about the founders of Troy!" Smurov put<br/>in suddenly, proud of Krassotkin at such a moment. He was<br/>particularly pleased with the story of the goose.<br/><br/>"Did you really take him down?" the captain inquired, in a<br/>flattering way. "On the question who founded Troy? We heard of it,<br/>Ilusha told me about it at the time."<br/><br/>"He knows everything, father, he knows more than any of us!" put<br/>in Ilusha; "he only pretends to be like that, but really he is top<br/>in every subject… "<br/><br/>Ilusha looked at Kolya with infinite happiness.<br/>
