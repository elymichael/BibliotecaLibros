"I came in from the back-alley, over the fence, and went
straight to the summer-house. I hope you'll forgive me, he added
addressing Marya Kondratyevna. "I was in a hurry to find my
brother."

"Ach, as though we could take it amiss in you!" drawled Marya
Kondratyevna, flattered by Alyosha's apology. "For Dmitri
Fyodorovitch often goes to the summer-house in that way. We don't
know he is here and he is sitting in the summer-house."

"I am very anxious to find him, or to learn from you where he is
now. Believe me, it's on business of great importance to him."

"He never tells us," lisped Marya Kondratyevna.

"Though I used to come here as a friend," Smerdyakov began
again, "Dmitri Fyodorovitch has pestered me in a merciless way even
here by his incessant questions about the master. 'What news?'
he'll ask. 'What's going on in there now? Who's coming and going?'
and can't I tell him something more. Twice already he's threatened
me with death

"With death?" Alyosha exclaimed in surprise.

"Do you suppose he'd think much of that, with his temper, which
you had a chance of observing yourself yesterday? He says if I let
Agrafena Alexandrovna in and she passes the night there, I'll be
the first to suffer for it. I am terribly afraid of him, and if I
were not even more afraid of doing so, I ought to let the police
know. God only knows what he might not do!"

"His honour said to him the other day, 'I'll pound you in a
mortar!'" added Marya Kondratyevna.

"Oh, if it's pounding in a mortar, it may be only talk,"
observed Alyosha. "If I could meet him, I might speak to him about
that too."

"Well, the only thing I can tell you is this," said Smerdyakov,
as though thinking better of it; "I am here as an old friend and
neighbour, and it would be odd if I didn't come. On the other hand,
Ivan Fyodorovitch sent me first thing this morning to your
brother's lodging in Lake Street, without a letter, but with a
message to Dmitri Fyodorovitch to go to dine with him at the
restaurant here, in the marketplace. I went, but didn't find Dmitri
Fyodorovitch at home, though it was eight o'clock. 'He's been here,
but he is quite gone,' those were the very words of his landlady.
It's as though there was an understanding between them. Perhaps at
this moment he is in the restaurant with Ivan Fyodorovitch, for
Ivan Fyodorovitch has not been home to dinner and Fyodor Pavlovitch
dined alone an hour ago, and is gone to lie down. But I beg you
most particularly not to speak of me and of what I have told you,
for he'd kill me for nothing at all."

"Brother Ivan invited Dmitri to the restaurant to-day?" repeated
Alyosha quickly.
