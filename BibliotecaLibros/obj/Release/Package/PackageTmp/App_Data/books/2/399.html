"He certainly would have accepted it," Mitya declared warmly.<br/>"Why, look here, he might have grabbed not two thousand, but four<br/>or six, for it. He would have put his lawyers, Poles and Jews, on<br/>to the job, and might have got, not three thousand, but the whole<br/>property out of the old man."<br/><br/>The evidence of Pan Mussyalovitch was, of course, entered in the<br/>protocol in the fullest detail. Then they let the Poles go. The<br/>incident of the cheating at cards was hardly touched upon. Nikolay<br/>Parfenovitch was too well pleased with them, as it was, and did not<br/>want to worry them with trifles, moreover, it was nothing but a<br/>foolish, drunken quarrel over cards. There had been drinking and<br/>disorder enough, that night… . So the two hundred roubles remained<br/>in the pockets of the Poles.<br/><br/>Then old Maximov was summoned. He came in timidly, approached<br/>with little steps, looking very dishevelled and depressed. He had,<br/>all this time, taken refuge below with Grushenka, sitting dumbly<br/>beside her, and "now and then he'd begin blubbering over her and<br/>wiping his eyes with a blue check handkerchief," as Mihail<br/>Makarovitch described afterwards. So that she herself began trying<br/>to pacify and comfort him. The old man at once confessed that he<br/>had done wrong, that he had borrowed "ten roubles in my poverty,"<br/>from Dmitri Fyodorovitch, and that he was ready to pay it back. To<br/>Nikolay Parfenovitch's direct question, had he noticed how much<br/>money Dmitri Fyodorovitch held in his hand, as he must have been<br/>able to see the sum better than anyone when he took the note from<br/>him, Maximov, in the most positive manner, declared that there was<br/>twenty thousand.<br/><br/>"Have you ever seen so much as twenty thousand before, then?"<br/>inquired Nikolay Parfenovitch, with a smile.<br/><br/>"To be sure I have, not twenty, but seven, when my wife<br/>mortgaged my little property. She'd only let me look at it from a<br/>distance, boasting of it to me. It was a very thick bundle, all<br/>rainbow-coloured notes. And Dmitri Fyodorovitch's were all<br/>rainbow-coloured… "<br/><br/>He was not kept long. At last it was Grushenka's turn. Nikolay<br/>Parfenovitch was obviously apprehensive of the effect her<br/>appearance might have on Mitya, and he muttered a few words of<br/>admonition to him, but Mitya bowed his head in silence, giving him<br/>to understand "that he would not make a scene." Mihail Makarovitch<br/>himself led Grushenka in. She entered with a stern and gloomy face,<br/>that looked almost composed, and sat down quietly on the chair<br/>offered her by Nikolay Parfenovitch. She was very pale, she seemed<br/>to be cold, and wrapped herself closely in her magnificent black<br/>shawl. She was suffering from a slight feverish chill- the first<br/>symptom of the long illness which followed that night. Her grave<br/>air, her direct earnest look and quiet manner made a very<br/>favourable impression on everyone. Nikolay Parfenovitch was even a<br/>little bit "fascinated." He admitted himself, when talking about it<br/>afterwards, that only then had he seen "how handsome the woman<br/>was," for, though he had seen her several times he had always<br/>looked upon her as something of a "provincial hetaira." "She has<br/>the manners of the best society," he said enthusiastically,<br/>gossiping about her in a circle of ladies. But this was received<br/>with positive indignation by the ladies, who immediately called him<br/>a "naughty man," to his great satisfaction.<br/><br/>As she entered the room, Grushenka only glanced for an instant<br/>at Mitya, who looked at her uneasily. But her face reassured him at<br/>once. After the first inevitable inquiries and warnings, Nikolay<br/>Parfenovitch asked her, hesitating a little, but preserving the<br/>most courteous manner, on what terms she was with the retired<br/>lieutenant, Dmitri Fyodorovitch Karamazov. To this Grushenka firmly<br/>and quietly replied:<br/><br/>"He was an acquaintance. He came to see me as an acquaintance<br/>during the last month." To further inquisitive questions she<br/>answered plainly and with complete frankness, that, though "at<br/>times" she had thought him attractive, she had not loved him, but<br/>had won his heart as well as his old father's "in my nasty spite,"<br/>that she had seen that Mitya was very jealous of Fyodor Pavlovitch<br/>and everyone else; but that had only amused her. She had never<br/>meant to go to Fyodor Pavlovitch, she had simply been laughing at<br/>him. "I had no thoughts for either of them all this last month. I<br/>was expecting another man who had wronged me. But I think," she<br/>said in conclusion, "that there's no need for you to inquire about<br/>that, nor for me to answer you, for that's my own affair."<br/><br/>Nikolay Parfenovitch immediately acted upon this hint. He again<br/>dismissed the "romantic" aspect of the case and passed to the<br/>serious one, that is, to the question of most importance,<br/>concerning the three thousand roubles. Grushenka confirmed the<br/>statement that three thousand roubles had certainly been spent on<br/>the first carousal at Mokroe, and, though she had not counted the<br/>money herself, she had heard that it was three thousand from Dmitri<br/>Fyodorovitch's own lips.<br/><br/>"Did he tell you that alone, or before someone else, or did you<br/>only hear him speak of it to others in your presence?" the<br/>prosecutor inquired immediately.<br/><br/>To which Grushenka replied that she had heard him say so before<br/>other people, and had heard him say so when they were alone.<br/>
