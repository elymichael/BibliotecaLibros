<br/>"How disgraceful!" cried Pyotr Alexandrovitch.<br/><br/>"Pardon me!" said the Father Superior. "It was said of old,<br/>'Many have begun to speak against me and have uttered evil sayings<br/>about me. And hearing it I have said to myself: it is the<br/>correction of the Lord and He has sent it to heal my vain soul.'<br/>And so we humbly thank you, honoured guest!" and he made Fyodor<br/>Pavlovitch a low bow.<br/><br/>"Tut- tut- tut- sanctimoniousness and stock phrases! Old phrases<br/>and old gestures. The old lies and formal prostrations. We know all<br/>about them. A kiss on the lips and a dagger in the heart, as in<br/>Schiller's Robbers. I don't like falsehood, Fathers, I want the<br/>truth. But the truth is not to be found in eating gudgeon and that<br/>I proclaim aloud! Father monks, why do you fast? Why do you expect<br/>reward in heaven for that? Why, for reward like that I will come<br/>and fast too! No, saintly monk, you try being virtuous in the<br/>world, do good to society, without shutting yourself up in a<br/>monastery at other people's expense, and without expecting a reward<br/>up aloft for it- you'll find that a bit harder. I can talk sense,<br/>too, Father Superior. What have they got here?" He went up to the<br/>table. "Old port wine, mead brewed by the Eliseyev Brothers. Fie,<br/>fie, fathers! That is something beyond gudgeon. Look at the bottles<br/>the fathers have brought out, he he he! And who has provided it<br/>all? The Russian peasant, the labourer, brings here the farthing<br/>earned by his horny hand, wringing it from his family and the<br/>tax-gatherer! You bleed the people, you know, holy Fathers."<br/><br/>"This is too disgraceful!" said Father Iosif.<br/><br/>Father Paissy kept obstinately silent. Miusov rushed from the<br/>room, and Kalgonov after him.<br/><br/>"Well, Father, I will follow Pyotr Alexandrovitch! I am not<br/>coming to see you again. You may beg me on your knees, I shan't<br/>come. I sent you a thousand roubles, so you have begun to keep your<br/>eye on me. He he he! No, I'll say no more. I am taking my revenge<br/>for my youth, for all the humiliation I endured." He thumped the<br/>table with his fist in a paroxysm of simulated feeling. "This<br/>monastery has played a great part in my life! It has cost me many<br/>bitter tears. You used to set my wife, the crazy one, against me.<br/>You cursed me with bell and book, you spread stories about me all<br/>over the place. Enough, fathers! This is the age of Liberalism, the<br/>age of steamers and railways. Neither a thousand, nor a hundred<br/>roubles, no, nor a hundred farthings will you get out of me!"<br/><br/>It must be noted again that our monastery never had played any<br/>great part in his life, and he never had shed a bitter tear owing<br/>to it. But he was so carried away by his simulated emotion, that he<br/>was for one moment almost believing it himself. He was so touched<br/>he was almost weeping. But at that very instant, he felt that it<br/>was time to draw back.<br/><br/>The Father Superior bowed his head at his malicious lie, and<br/>again spoke impressively:<br/><br/>"It is written again, 'Bear circumspectly and gladly dishonour<br/>that cometh upon thee by no act of thine own, be not confounded and<br/>hate not him who hath dishonoured thee.' And so will we."<br/><br/>"Tut, tut, tut! Bethinking thyself and the rest of the<br/>rigmarole. Bethink yourselves Fathers, I will go. But I will take<br/>my son, Alexey, away from here for ever, on my parental authority.<br/>Ivan Fyodorovitch, my most dutiful son, permit me to order you to<br/>follow me. Von Sohn, what have you to stay for? Come and see me now<br/>in the town. It is fun there. It is only one short verst; instead<br/>of lenten oil, I will give you sucking-pig and kasha. We will have<br/>dinner with some brandy and liqueur to itâ€¦ . I've cloudberry wine.<br/>Hey, von Sohn, don't lose your chance." He went out, shouting and<br/>gesticulating.<br/><br/>
