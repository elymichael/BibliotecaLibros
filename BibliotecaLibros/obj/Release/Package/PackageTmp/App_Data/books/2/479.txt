"How can I leave you like this?" said Alyosha, almost in
alarm.

"Go to your brother, the prison will be shut; go, here's your
hat. Give my love to Mitya, go, go!"

And she almost forcibly pushed Alyosha out of the door. He
looked at her with pained surprise, when he was suddenly aware of a
letter in his right hand, a tiny letter folded up tight and sealed.
He glanced at it and instantly read the address, "To Ivan
Fyodorovitch Karamazov." He looked quickly at Lise. Her face had
become almost menacing.

"Give it to him, you must give it to him!" she ordered him,
trembling and beside herself. "To-day, at once, or I'll poison
myself! That's why I sent for you."

And she slammed the door quickly. The bolt clicked. Alyosha put
the note in his pocket and went straight downstairs, without going
back to Madame Hohlakov; forgetting her, in fact. As soon as
Alyosha had gone, Lise unbolted the door, opened it a little, put
her finger in the crack and slammed the door with all her might,
pinching her finger. Ten seconds after, releasing her finger, she
walked softly, slowly to her chair, sat up straight in it and
looked intently at her blackened finger and at the blood that oozed
from under the nail. Her lips were quivering and she kept
whispering rapidly to herself:

"I am a wretch, wretch, wretch, wretch!"
