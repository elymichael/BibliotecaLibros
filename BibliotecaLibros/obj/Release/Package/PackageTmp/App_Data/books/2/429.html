"And what's your Tchizhov to do with me, good people, eh?"<br/><br/>"How can I tell what he's to do with you?" put in another. "You<br/>ought to know yourself what you want with him, if you make such a<br/>clamour about him. He spoke to you, he did not speak to us, you<br/>stupid. Don't you really know him?"<br/><br/>"Know whom?"<br/><br/>"Tchizhov."<br/><br/>"The devil take Tchizhov and you with him. I'll give him a<br/>hiding, that I will. He was laughing at me!"<br/><br/>"Will give Tchizhov a hiding! More likely he will give you one.<br/>You are a fool, that's what you are!"<br/><br/>"Not Tchizhov, not Tchizhov, you spiteful, mischievous woman.<br/>I'll give the boy a hiding. Catch him, catch him, he was laughing<br/>at me<br/><br/>The woman guffawed. But Kolya was by now a long way off,<br/>marching along with a triumphant air. Smurov walked beside him,<br/>looking round at the shouting group far behind. He too was in high<br/>spirits, though he was still afraid of getting into some scrape in<br/>Kolya's company.<br/><br/>"What Sabaneyev did you mean?" he asked Kolya, foreseeing what<br/>his answer would be.<br/><br/>"How do I know? Now there'll be a hubbub among them all day. I<br/>like to stir up fools in every class of society. There's another<br/>blockhead, that peasant there. You know, they say 'there's no one<br/>stupider than a stupid Frenchman,' but a stupid Russian shows it in<br/>his face just as much. Can't you see it all over his face that he<br/>is a fool, that peasant, eh?"<br/><br/>"Let him alone, Kolya. Let's go on."<br/>
