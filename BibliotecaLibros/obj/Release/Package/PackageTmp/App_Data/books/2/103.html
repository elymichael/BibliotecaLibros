<br/>"Brother, how will all this horror end between father and<br/>Dmitri?" exclaimed Alyosha.<br/><br/>"One can't tell for certain. Perhaps in nothing: it may all<br/>fizzle out. That woman is a beast. In any case we must keep the old<br/>man indoors and not let Dmitri in the house."<br/><br/>"Brother, let me ask one thing more: has any man a right to look<br/>at other men and decide which is worthy to live?"<br/><br/>"Why bring in the question of worth? The matter is most often<br/>decided in men's hearts on other grounds much more natural. And as<br/>for rights- who has not the right to wish?"<br/><br/>"Not for another man's death?"<br/><br/>"What even if for another man's death? Why lie to oneself since<br/>all men live so and perhaps cannot help living so. Are you<br/>referring to what I said just now- that one reptile will devour the<br/>other? In that case let me ask you, do you think me like Dmitri<br/>capable of shedding Aesop's blood, murdering him, eh?"<br/><br/>"What are you saying, Ivan? Such an idea never crossed my mind.<br/>I don't think Dmitri is capable of it, either."<br/><br/>"Thanks, if only for that," smiled Ivan. "Be sure, I should<br/>always defend him. But in my wishes I reserve myself full latitude<br/>in this case. Good-bye till to-morrow. Don't condemn me, and don't<br/>look on me as a villain," he added with a smile.<br/><br/>They shook hands warmly as they had never done before. Alyosha<br/>felt that his brother had taken the first step towards him, and<br/>that he had certainly done this with some definite motive.<br/><br/><br/><br/>
