"What Trifon Nikititch?" asked the youth, staring with loutish
amazement at Kolya, but still as angry as ever.

Kolya scanned him gravely.

"Have you been to the Church of the Ascension?" he suddenly
asked him, with stern emphasis.

"What Church of Ascension? What for? No, I haven't," said the
young man, somewhat taken aback.

"Do you know Sabaneyev?" Kolya went on even more emphatically
and even more severely.

"What Sabaneyev? No, I don't know him."

"Well then you can go to the devil," said Kolya, cutting short
the conversation; and turning sharply to the right he strode
quickly on his way as though he disdained further conversation with
a dolt who did not even know Sabaneyev.

"Stop, heigh! What Sabaneyev?" the young man recovered from his
momentary stupefaction and was as excited as before. "What did he
say?" He turned to the market women with a silly stare.

The women laughed.

"You can never tell what he's after," said one of them.

"What Sabaneyev is it he's talking about?" the young man
repeated, still furious and brandishing his right arm.
