A
Sudden Resolution


SHE was sitting in the kitchen with her grandmother; they were
both just going to bed. Relying on Nazar Ivanovitch, they had not
locked themselves in. Mitya ran in, pounced on Fenya and seized her
by the throat.

"Speak at once! Where is she? With whom is she now, at Mokroe?"
he roared furiously.

Both the women squealed.

"Aie! I'll tell you. Aie! Dmitri Fyodorovitch, darling, I'll
tell you everything directly, I won't hide anything," gabbled
Fenya, frightened to death; "she's gone to Mokroe, to her
officer."

"What officer?" roared Mitya.

"To her officer, the same one she used to know, the one who
threw her over five years ago," cackled Fenya, as fast as she could
speak.

Mitya withdrew the hands with which he was squeezing her throat.
He stood facing her, pale as death, unable to utter a word, but his
eyes showed that he realised it all, all, from the first word, and
guessed the whole position. Poor Fenya was not in a condition at
that moment to observe whether he understood or not. She remained
sitting on the trunk as she had been when he ran into the room,
trembling all over, holding her hands out before her as though
trying to defend herself. She seemed to have grown rigid in that
position. Her wide-opened, scared eyes were fixed immovably upon
him. And to make matters worse, both his hands were smeared with
blood. On the way, as he ran, he must have touched his forehead
with them, wiping off the perspiration, so that on his forehead and
his right cheek were bloodstained patches. Fenya was on the verge
of hysterics. The old cook had jumped up and was staring at him
like a mad woman, almost unconscious with terror.
