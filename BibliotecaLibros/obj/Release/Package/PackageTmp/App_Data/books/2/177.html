"Certainly, love it, regardless of logic as you say, it must be<br/>regardless of logic, and it's only then one will understand the<br/>meaning of it. I have thought so a long time. Half your work is<br/>done, Ivan, you love life, now you've only to try to do the second<br/>half and you are saved."<br/><br/>"You are trying to save me, but perhaps I am not lost! And what<br/>does your second half mean?"<br/><br/>"Why, one has to raise up your dead, who perhaps have not died<br/>after all. Come, let me have tea. I am so glad of our talk,<br/>Ivan."<br/><br/>"I see you are feeling inspired. I am awfully fond of such<br/>professions de foi<br/>[7]<br/>from such-<br/>novices. You are a steadfast person, Alexey. Is it true that you<br/>mean to leave the monastery?" "Yes, my elder sends me out into the<br/>world." "We shall see each other then in the world. We shall meet<br/>before I am thirty, when I shall begin to turn aside from the cup.<br/>Father doesn't want to turn aside from his cup till he is seventy,<br/>he dreams of hanging on to eighty in fact, so he says. He means it<br/>only too seriously, though he is a buffoon. He stands on a firm<br/>rock, too, he stands on his sensuality though after we are thirty,<br/>indeed, there may be nothing else to stand on… . But to hang on to<br/>seventy is nasty, better only to thirty; one might retain 'a shadow<br/>of nobility' by deceiving oneself. Have you seen Dmitri to-day?"<br/>"No, but I saw Smerdyakov," and Alyosha rapidly, though minutely,<br/>described his meeting with Smerdyakov. Ivan began listening<br/>anxiously and questioned him. "But he begged me not to tell Dmitri<br/>that he had told me about him," added Alyosha. Ivan frowned and<br/>pondered. "Are you frowning on Smerdyakov's account?" asked<br/>Alyosha. "Yes, on his account. Damn him, I certainly did want to<br/>see Dmitri, but now there's no need," said Ivan reluctantly. "But<br/>are you really going so soon, brother?" "What of Dmitri and father?<br/>how will it end?" asked Alyosha anxiously. "You are always harping<br/>upon it! What have I to do with it? Am I my brother Dmitri's<br/>keeper?" Ivan snapped irritably, but then he suddenly smiled<br/>bitterly. "Cain's answer about his murdered brother, wasn't it?<br/>Perhaps that's what you're thinking at this moment? Well damn it<br/>all, I can't stay here to be their keeper, can I? I've finished<br/>what I had to do, and I am going. Do you imagine I am jealous of<br/>Dmitri, that I've been trying to steal his beautiful Katerina<br/>Ivanovna for the last three months? Nonsense, I had business of my<br/>own. I finished it. I am going. I finished it just now, you were<br/>witness." "At Katerina Ivanovna's?" "Yes, and I've released myself<br/>once for all. And after all, what have I to do with Dmitri? Dmitri<br/>doesn't come in. I had my own business to settle with Katerina<br/>Ivanovna. You know, on the contrary, that Dmitri behaved as though<br/>there was an understanding between us. I didn't ask to do it, but<br/>he solemnly handed her over to me and gave us his blessing. It's<br/>all too funny. Ah, Alyosha, if you only knew how light my heart is<br/>now! Would you believe it, I sat here eating my dinner and was<br/>nearly ordering champagne to celebrate my first hour of freedom.<br/>Tfoo! It's been going on nearly six months, and all at once I've<br/>thrown it off. I could never have guessed even yesterday, how easy<br/>it would be to put an end to it if I wanted." "You are speaking of<br/>your love, Ivan?" "Of my love, if you like. I fell in love with the<br/>young lady, I worried myself over her and she worried me. I sat<br/>watching over her… and all at once it's collapsed! I spoke this<br/>morning with inspiration, but I went away and roared with laughter.<br/>Would you believe it? Yes, it's the literal truth." "You seem very<br/>merry about it now," observed Alyosha, looking into his face, which<br/>had suddenly grown brighter. "But how could I tell that I didn't<br/>care for her a bit! Ha ha! It appears after all I didn't. And yet<br/>how she attracted me! How attractive she was just now when I made<br/>my speech! And do you know she attracts me awfully even now, yet<br/>how easy it is to leave her. Do you think I am boasting?" "No, only<br/>perhaps it wasn't love." "Alyosha," laughed Ivan, "don't make<br/>reflections about love, it's unseemly for you. How you rushed into<br/>the discussion this morning! I've forgotten to kiss you for it… .<br/>But how she tormented me! It certainly was sitting by a<br/>'laceration.' Ah, she knew how I loved her! She loved me and not<br/>Dmitri," Ivan insisted gaily. "Her feeling for Dmitri was simply a<br/>self-laceration. All I told her just now was perfectly true, but<br/>the worst of it is, it may take her fifteen or twenty years to find<br/>out that she doesn't care for Dmitri, and loves me whom she<br/>torments, and perhaps she may never find it out at all, in spite of<br/>her lesson to-day. Well, it's better so; I can simply go away for<br/>good. By the way, how is she now? What happened after I departed?"<br/>Alyosha told him she had been hysterical, and that she was now, he<br/>heard, unconscious and delirious. "Isn't Madame Hohlakov laying it<br/>on?" "I think not." "I must find out. Nobody dies of hysterics,<br/>though. They don't matter. God gave woman hysterics as a relief. I<br/>won't go to her at all. Why push myself forward again?" "But you<br/>told her that she had never cared for you." "I did that on purpose.<br/>Alyosha, shall I call for some champagne? Let us drink to my<br/>freedom. Ah, if only you knew how glad I am!" "No, brother, we had<br/>better not drink," said Alyosha suddenly. "Besides I feel somehow<br/>depressed." "Yes, you've been depressed a long time, I've noticed<br/>it." "Have you settled to go to-morrow morning, then?" "Morning? I<br/>didn't say I should go in the morning… . But perhaps it may be the<br/>morning. Would you believe it, I dined here to-day only to avoid<br/>dining with the old man, I loathe him so. I should have left long<br/>ago, so far as he is concerned. But why are you so worried about my<br/>going away? We've plenty of time before I go, an eternity!" "If you<br/>are going away to-morrow, what do you mean by an eternity?" "But<br/>what does it matter to us?" laughed Ivan. "We've time enough for<br/>our talk, for what brought us here. Why do you look so surprised?<br/>Answer: why have we met here? To talk of my love for Katerina<br/>Ivanovna, of the old man and Dmitri? of foreign travel? of the<br/>fatal position of Russia? of the Emperor Napoleon? Is that it?"<br/>"No." "Then you know what for. It's different for other people; but<br/>we in our green youth have to settle the eternal questions first of<br/>all. That's what we care about. Young Russia is talking about<br/>nothing but the eternal questions now. just when the old folks are<br/>all taken up with practical questions. Why have you been looking at<br/>me in expectation for the last three months? To ask me, 'What do<br/>you believe, or don't you believe at all?' That's what your eyes<br/>have been meaning for these three months, haven't they?" "Perhaps<br/>so," smiled Alyosha. "You are not laughing at me, now, Ivan? "Me<br/>laughing! I don't want to wound my little brother who has been<br/>watching me with such expectation for three months. Alyosha, look<br/>straight at me! Of course, I am just such a little boy as you are,<br/>only not a novice. And what have Russian boys been doing up till<br/>now, some of them, I mean? In this stinking tavern, for instance,<br/>here, they meet and sit down in a corner. They've never met in<br/>their lives before and, when they go out of the tavern, they won't<br/>meet again for forty years. And what do they talk about in that<br/>momentary halt in the tavern? Of the eternal questions, of the<br/>existence of God and immortality. And those who do not believe in<br/>God talk of socialism or anarchism, of the transformation of all<br/>humanity on a new pattern, so that it all comes to the same,<br/>they're the same questions turned inside out. And masses, masses of<br/>the most original Russian boys do nothing but talk of the eternal<br/>questions! Isn't it so?" "Yes, for real Russians the questions of<br/>God's existence and of immortality, or, as you say, the same<br/>questions turned inside out, come first and foremost, of course,<br/>and so they should," said Alyosha, still watching his brother with<br/>the same gentle and inquiring smile. "Well, Alyosha, it's sometimes<br/>very unwise to be a Russian at all, but anything stupider than the<br/>way Russian boys spend their time one can hardly imagine. But<br/>there's one Russian boy called Alyosha I am awfully fond of." "How<br/>nicely you put that in!" Alyosha laughed suddenly. "Well, tell me<br/>where to begin, give your orders. The existence of God, eh?" "Begin<br/>where you like. You declared yesterday at father's that there was<br/>no God." Alyosha looked searchingly at his brother. "I said that<br/>yesterday at dinner on purpose to tease you and I saw your eyes<br/>glow. But now I've no objection to discussing with you, and I say<br/>so very seriously. I want to be friends with you, Alyosha, for I<br/>have no friends and want to try it. Well, only fancy, perhaps I too<br/>accept God," laughed Ivan; "that's a surprise for you, isn't it?"<br/>"Yes of course, if you are not joking now." "Joking? I was told at<br/>the elder's yesterday that I was joking. You know, dear boy, there<br/>was an old sinner in the eighteenth century who declared that, if<br/>there were no God, he would have to be invented. S'il n'existait<br/>pas Dieu, il faudrait l'inventer. And man has actually invented<br/>God. And what's strange, what would be marvellous, is not that God<br/>should really exist; the marvel is that such an idea, the idea of<br/>the necessity of God, could enter the head of such a savage,<br/>vicious beast as man. So holy it is, so touching, so wise and so<br/>great a credit it does to man. As for me, I've long resolved not to<br/>think whether man created God or God man. And I won't go through<br/>all the axioms laid down by Russian boys on that subject, all<br/>derived from European hypotheses; for what's a hypothesis there is<br/>an axiom with the Russian boy, and not only with the boys but with<br/>their teachers too, for our Russian professors are often just the<br/>same boys themselves. And so I omit all the hypotheses. For what<br/>are we aiming at now? I am trying to explain as quickly as possible<br/>my essential nature, that is what manner of man I am, what I<br/>believe in, and for what I hope, that's it, isn't it? And therefore<br/>I tell you that I accept God simply. But you must note this: if God<br/>exists and if He really did create the world, then, as we all know,<br/>He created it according to the geometry of Euclid and the human<br/>mind with the conception of only three dimensions in space. Yet<br/>there have been and still are geometricians and philosophers, and<br/>even some of the most distinguished, who doubt whether the whole<br/>universe, or to speak more widely, the whole of being, was only<br/>created in Euclid's geometry; they even dare to dream that two<br/>parallel lines, which according to Euclid can never meet on earth,<br/>may meet somewhere in infinity. I have come to the conclusion that,<br/>since I can't understand even that, I can't expect to understand<br/>about God. I acknowledge humbly that I have no faculty for settling<br/>such questions, I have a Euclidian earthly mind, and how could I<br/>solve problems that are not of this world? And I advise you never<br/>to think about it either, my dear Alyosha, especially about God,<br/>whether He exists or not. All such questions are utterly<br/>inappropriate for a mind created with an idea of only three<br/>dimensions. And so I accept God and am glad to, and what's more, I<br/>accept His wisdom, His purpose which are utterly beyond our ken; I<br/>believe in the underlying order and the meaning of life; I believe<br/>in the eternal harmony in which they say we shall one day be<br/>blended. I believe in the Word to Which the universe is striving,<br/>and Which Itself was 'with God,' and Which Itself is God and so on,<br/>and so on, to infinity. There are all sorts of phrases for it. I<br/>seem to be on the right path, don't I'? Yet would you believe it,<br/>in the final result I don't accept this world of God's, and,<br/>although I know it exists, I don't accept it at all. It's not that<br/>I don't accept God, you must understand, it's the world created by<br/>Him I don't and cannot accept. Let me make it plain. I believe like<br/>a child that suffering will be healed and made up for, that all the<br/>humiliating absurdity of human contradictions will vanish like a<br/>pitiful mirage, like the despicable fabrication of the impotent and<br/>infinitely small Euclidian mind of man, that in the world's finale,<br/>at the moment of eternal harmony, something so precious will come<br/>to pass that it will suffice for all hearts, for the comforting of<br/>all resentments, for the atonement of all the crimes of humanity,<br/>of all the blood they've shed; that it will make it not only<br/>possible to forgive but to justify all that has happened with men-<br/>but thought all that may come to pass, I don't accept it. I won't<br/>accept it. Even if parallel lines do meet and I see it myself, I<br/>shall see it and say that they've met, but still I won't accept it.<br/>That's what's at the root of me, Alyosha; that's my creed. I am in<br/>earnest in what I say. I began our talk as stupidly as I could on<br/>purpose, but I've led up to my confession, for that's all you want.<br/>You didn't want to hear about God, but only to know what the<br/>brother you love lives by. And so I've told you." Ivan concluded<br/>his long tirade with marked and unexpected feeling. "And why did<br/>you begin 'as stupidly as you could'?" asked Alyosha, looking<br/>dreamily at him. "To begin with, for the sake of being Russian.<br/>Russian conversations on such subjects are always carried on<br/>inconceivably stupidly. And secondly, the stupider one is, the<br/>closer one is to reality. The stupider one is, the clearer one is.<br/>Stupidity is brief and artless, while intelligence wriggles and<br/>hides itself. Intelligence is a knave, but stupidity is honest and<br/>straight forward. I've led the conversation to my despair, and the<br/>more stupidly I have presented it, the better for me." "You will<br/>explain why you don't accept the world?" said Alyosha. "To be sure<br/>I will, it's not a secret, that's what I've been leading up to.<br/>Dear little brother, I don't want to corrupt you or to turn you<br/>from your stronghold, perhaps I want to be healed by you." Ivan<br/>smiled suddenly quite like a little gentle child. Alyosha had never<br/>seen such a smile on his face before.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
