"With<br/>this eight hundred you must have had about fifteen hundred at<br/>first?"<br/><br/>"I suppose so," snapped Mitya.<br/><br/>"How is it they all assert there was much more?"<br/><br/>"Let them assert it."<br/><br/>"But you asserted it yourself."<br/><br/>"Yes, I did, too."<br/><br/>"We will compare all this with the evidence of other persons not<br/>yet examined. Don't be anxious about your money. It will be<br/>properly taken care of and be at your disposal at the conclusion<br/>of… what is beginning… if it appears, or, so to speak, is proved<br/>that you have undisputed right to it. Well, and now… "<br/><br/>Nikolay Parfenovitch suddenly got up, and informed Mitya firmly<br/>that it was his duty and obligation to conduct a minute and<br/>thorough search "of your clothes and everything else… "<br/><br/>"By all means, gentlemen. I'll turn out all my pockets, if you<br/>like."<br/><br/>And he did, in fact, begin turning out his pockets.<br/><br/>"It will be necessary to take off your clothes, too."<br/>
