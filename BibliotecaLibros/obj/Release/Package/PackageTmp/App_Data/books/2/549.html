And can Katerina Ivanovna, with her intelligence, her morbid<br/>sensitiveness, have failed to understand that people would talk<br/>like that? She must have understood it, yet she made up her mind to<br/>tell everything. Of course, all these nasty little suspicions as to<br/>the truth of her story only arose afterwards and at the first<br/>moment all were deeply impressed by it. As for the judges and the<br/>lawyers, they listened in reverent, almost shamefaced silence to<br/>Katerina Ivanovna. The prosecutor did not venture upon even one<br/>question on the subject. Fetyukovitch made a low bow to her. Oh, he<br/>was almost triumphant! Much ground had been gained. For a man to<br/>give his last four thousand on a generous impulse and then for the<br/>same man to murder his father for the sake of robbing him of three<br/>thousand- the idea seemed too incongruous. Fetyukovitch felt that<br/>now the charge of theft, at least, was as good as disproved. "The<br/>case" was thrown into quite a different light. There was a wave of<br/>sympathy for Mitya. As for him… . I was told that once or twice,<br/>while Katerina Ivanovna was giving her evidence, he jumped up from<br/>his seat, sank back again, and hid his face in his hands. But when<br/>she had finished, he suddenly cried in a sobbing voice:<br/><br/>"Katya, why have you ruined me?" and his sobs were audible all<br/>over the court. But he instantly restrained himself, and cried<br/>again:<br/><br/>"Now I am condemned!"<br/><br/>Then he sat rigid in his place, with his teeth clenched and his<br/>arms across his chest. Katerina Ivanovna remained in the court and<br/>sat down in her place. She was pale and sat with her eyes cast<br/>down. Those who were sitting near her declared that for a long time<br/>she shivered all over as though in a fever. Grushenka was<br/>called.<br/><br/>I am approaching the sudden catastrophe which was perhaps the<br/>final cause of Mitya's ruin. For I am convinced, so is everyone-<br/>all the lawyers said the same afterwards- that if the episode had<br/>not occurred, the prisoner would at least have been recommended to<br/>mercy. But of that later. A few words first about Grushenka.<br/><br/>She, too, was dressed entirely in black, with her magnificent<br/>black shawl on her shoulders. She walked to the witness-box with<br/>her smooth, noiseless tread, with the slightly swaying gait common<br/>in women of full figure. She looked steadily at the President,<br/>turning her eyes neither to the right nor to the left. To my<br/>thinking she looked very handsome at that moment, and not at all<br/>pale, as the ladies alleged afterwards. They declared, too, that<br/>she had a concentrated and spiteful expression. I believe that she<br/>was simply irritated and painfully conscious of the contemptuous<br/>and inquisitive eyes of our scandal-loving public. She was proud<br/>and could not stand contempt. She was one of those people who flare<br/>up, angry and eager to retaliate, at the mere suggestion of<br/>contempt. There was an element of timidity, too, of course, and<br/>inward shame at her own timidity, so it was not strange that her<br/>tone kept changing. At one moment it was angry, contemptuous and<br/>rough, and at another there was a sincere note of<br/>self-condemnation. Sometimes she spoke as though she were taking a<br/>desperate plunge; as though she felt, "I don't care what happens,<br/>I'll say it… ." Apropos of her acquaintance with Fyodor Pavlovitch,<br/>she remarked curtly, "That's all nonsense, and was it my fault that<br/>he would pester me?" But a minute later she added, "It was all my<br/>fault. I was laughing at them both- at the old man and at him, too-<br/>and I brought both of them to this. It was all on account of me it<br/>happened."<br/><br/>Samsonov's name came up somehow. "That's nobody's business," she<br/>snapped at once, with a sort of insolent defiance. "He was my<br/>benefactor; he took me when I hadn't a shoe to my foot, when my<br/>family had turned me out." The President reminded her, though very<br/>politely, that she must answer the questions directly, without<br/>going off into irrelevant details. Grushenka crimsoned and her eyes<br/>flashed.<br/><br/>The envelope with the notes in it she had not seen, but had only<br/>heard from "that wicked wretch" that Fyodor Pavlovitch had an<br/>envelope with notes for three thousand in it. "But that was all<br/>foolishness. I was only laughing. I wouldn't have gone to him for<br/>anything."<br/><br/>"To whom are you referring as 'that wicked wretch'?" inquired<br/>the prosecutor.<br/><br/>"The lackey, Smerdyakov, who murdered his master and hanged<br/>himself last night."<br/><br/>She was, of course, at once asked what ground she had for such a<br/>definite accusation; but it appeared that she, too, had no grounds<br/>for it.<br/>
