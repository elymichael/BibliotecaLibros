Dmitri frowned painfully, and looked with unutterable contempt<br/>at his father.<br/><br/>"I thoughtâ€¦ I thought," he said. in a soft and, as it were,<br/>controlled voice, "that I was coming to my native place with the<br/>angel of my heart, my betrothed, to cherish his old age, and I find<br/>nothing but a depraved profligate, a despicable clown!"<br/><br/>"A duel!" yelled the old wretch again, breathless and<br/>spluttering at each syllable. "And you, Pyotr Alexandrovitch<br/>Miusov, let me tell you that there has never been in all your<br/>family a loftier, and more honest- you hear- more honest woman than<br/>this 'creature,' as you have dared to call her! And you, Dmitri<br/>Fyodorovitch, have abandoned your betrothed for that 'creature,' so<br/>you must yourself have thought that your betrothed couldn't hold a<br/>candle to her. That's the woman called a "creature"<br/><br/>"Shameful!" broke from Father Iosif.<br/><br/>"Shameful and disgraceful!" Kalganov, flushing crimson cried in<br/>a boyish voice, trembling with emotion. He had been silent till<br/>that moment.<br/><br/>"Why is such a man alive?" Dmitri, beside himself with rage,<br/>growled in a hollow voice, hunching up his shoulders till he looked<br/>almost deformed. "Tell me, can he be allowed to go on defiling the<br/>earth?" He looked round at everyone and pointed at the old man. He<br/>spoke evenly and deliberately.<br/><br/>"Listen, listen, monks, to the parricide!" cried Fyodor<br/>Pavlovitch, rushing up to Father Iosif. "That's the answer to your<br/>'shameful!' What is shameful? That 'creature,' that 'woman of loose<br/>behaviour' is perhaps holier than you are yourselves, you monks who<br/>are seeking salvation! She fell perhaps in her youth, ruined by her<br/>environment. But she loved much, and Christ himself forgave the<br/>woman 'who loved much.'"<br/><br/>"It was not for such love Christ forgave her," broke impatiently<br/>from the gentle Father Iosif.<br/><br/>"Yes, it was for such, monks, it was! You save your souls here,<br/>eating cabbage, and think you are the righteous. You eat a gudgeon<br/>a day, and you think you bribe God with gudgeon."<br/><br/>"This is unendurable!" was heard on all sides in the cell.<br/><br/>But this unseemly scene was cut short in a most unexpected way.<br/>Father Zossima Father Zossima rose suddenly from his seat. Almost<br/>distracted with anxiety for the elder and everyone else, Alyosha<br/>succeeded, however, in supporting him by the arm. Father Zossima<br/>moved towards Dmitri and reaching him sank on his knees before him.<br/>Alyosha thought that he had fallen from weakness, but this was not<br/>so. The elder distinctly and deliberately bowed down at Dmitri's<br/>feet till his forehead touched the floor. Alyosha was so astounded<br/>that he failed to assist him when he got up again. There was a<br/>faint smile on his lips.<br/>
