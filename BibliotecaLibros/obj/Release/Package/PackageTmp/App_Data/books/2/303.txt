"Cards?"

"So, maybe they're not in bed if they're at cards. It's most
likely not more than eleven."

"Quicker, Andrey! Quicker!" Mitya cried again, nervously.

"May I ask you something, sir?" said Andrey, after a pause.
"Only I'm afraid of angering you, sir."

"What is it?"

"Why, Fenya threw herself at your feet just now, and begged you
not to harm her mistress, and someone else, too… so you see, sir-
It's I am taking you there… forgive me, sir, it's my conscience…
maybe it's stupid of me to speak of it-."

Mitya suddenly seized him by the shoulders from behind.

"Are you a driver?" he asked frantically.

"Yes sir."

"Then you know that one has to make way. What would you say to a
driver who wouldn't make way for anyone, but would just drive on
and crush people? No, a driver mustn't run over people. One can't
run over a man. One can't spoil people's lives. And if you have
spoilt a life- punish yourself… . If only you've spoilt, if only
you've ruined anyone's life- punish yourself and go away."

These phrases burst from Mitya almost hysterically. Though
Andrey was surprised at him, he kept up the conversation.
