Alyosha unbound his bitten finger. The handkerchief was soaked
with blood. Madame Hohlakov screamed and shut her eyes.

"Good heavens, what a wound, how awful!

But as soon as Lise saw Alyosha's finger through the crack, she
flung the door wide open.

"Come, come here," she cried, imperiously. "No nonsense now!
Good heavens, why did you stand there saying nothing about it all
this time? He might have bled to death, mamma! How did you do it?
Water, water! You must wash it first of all, simply hold it in cold
water to stop the pain, and keep it there, keep it thereâ€¦ . Make
haste, mamma, some water in a slop-basin. But do make haste," she
finished nervously. She was quite frightened at the sight of
Alyosha's wound.

"Shouldn't we send for Herzenstube?" cried Madame Hohlakov.

"Mamma, you'll be the death of me. Your Herzenstube will come
and say that he can make nothing of it! Water, water! Mamma, for
goodness' sake go yourself and hurry Yulia, she is such a slowcoach
and never can come quickly! Make haste, mamma, or I shall die."

"Why, it's nothing much," cried Alyosha, frightened at this
alarm.

Yulia ran in with water and Alyosha put his finger in it.

"Some lint, mamma, for mercy's sake, bring some lint and that
muddy caustic lotion for wounds, what's it called? We've got some.
You know where the bottle is, mamma; it's in your bedroom in the
right-hand cupboard, there's a big bottle of it there with the
lint."

"I'll bring everything in a minute, Lise, only don't scream and
don't fuss. You see how bravely Alexey Fyodorovitch bears it. Where
did you get such a dreadful wound, Alexey Fyodorovitch?"

Madame Hohlakov hastened away. This was all Lise was waiting
for.
