<br/>"If he had been afraid of being shot, he would have shot his own<br/>pistol first before asking forgiveness, while he flung it loaded<br/>into the forest. No, there's something else in this, something<br/>original."<br/><br/>I enjoyed listening and looking at them. "My dear friends and<br/>comrades," said I, "don't worry about my resigning my commission,<br/>for I have done so already. I have sent in my papers this morning<br/>and as soon as I get my discharge I shall go into a monastery- it's<br/>with that object I am leaving the regiment."<br/><br/>When I had said this every one of them burst out laughing.<br/><br/>"You should have told us of that first, that explains<br/>everything, we can't judge a monk."<br/><br/>They laughed and could not stop themselves, and not scornfully,<br/>but kindly and merrily. They all felt friendly to me at once, even<br/>those who had been sternest in their censure, and all the following<br/>month, before my discharge came, they could not make enough of me.<br/>"Ah, you monk," they would say. And everyone said something kind to<br/>me, they began trying to dissuade me, even to pity me: "What are<br/>you doing to yourself?"<br/><br/>"No," they would say, "he is a brave fellow, he faced fire and<br/>could have fired his own pistol too, but he had a dream the night<br/>before that he should become a monk, that's why he did it."<br/><br/>It was the same thing with the society of the town. Till then I<br/>had been kindly received, but had not been the object of special<br/>attention, and now all came to know me at once and invited me; they<br/>laughed at me, but they loved me. I may mention that although<br/>everybody talked openly of our duel, the authorities took no notice<br/>of it, because my antagonist was a near relation of our general,<br/>and as there had been no bloodshed and no serious consequences, and<br/>as I resigned my commission, they took it as a joke. And I began<br/>then to speak aloud and fearlessly, regardless of their laughter,<br/>for it was always kindly and not spiteful laughter. These<br/>conversations mostly took place in the evenings, in the company of<br/>ladies; women particularly liked listening to me then and they made<br/>the men listen.<br/><br/>"But how can I possibly be responsible for all?" everyone would<br/>laugh in my face. "Can I, for instance, be responsible for<br/>you?"<br/><br/>"You may well not know it," I would answer, "since the whole<br/>world has long been going on a different line, since we consider<br/>the veriest lies as truth and demand the same lies from others.<br/>Here I have for once in my life acted sincerely and, well, you all<br/>look upon me as a madman. Though you are friendly to me, yet, you<br/>see, you all laugh at me."<br/><br/>"But how can we help being friendly to you?" said my hostess,<br/>laughing. The room was full of people. All of a sudden the young<br/>lady rose, on whose account the duel had been fought and whom only<br/>lately I had intended to be my future wife. I had not noticed her<br/>coming into the room. She got up, came to me and held out her<br/>hand.<br/><br/>
