"That's right, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, you're quite right, one
mustn't crush or torment a man, or any kind of creature, for every
creature is created by God. Take a horse, for instance, for some
folks, even among us drivers, drive anyhow. Nothing will restrain
them, they just force it along."

"To hell?" Mitya interrupted, and went off into his abrupt,
short laugh. "Andrey, simple soul," he seized him by the shoulders
again, "tell me, will Dmitri Fyodorovitch Karamazov go to hell, or
not, what do you think?"

"I don't know, darling, it depends on you, for you are… you see,
sir, when the Son of God was nailed on the Cross and died, He went
straight down to hell from the Cross, and set free all sinners that
were in agony. And the devil groaned, because he thought that he
would get no more sinners in hell. And God said to him, then,
'Don't groan, for you shall have all the mighty of the earth, the
rulers, the chief judges, and the rich men, and shall be filled up
as you have been in all the ages till I come again.' Those were His
very words… "

"A peasant legend! Capital! Whip up the left, Andrey!"

"So you see, sir, who it is hell's for," said Andrey, whipping
up the left horse, "but you're like a little child… that's how we
look on you… and though you're hasty-tempered, sir, yet God will
forgive you for your kind heart."

"And you, do you forgive me, Andrey?"

"What should I forgive you for, sir? You've never done me any
harm."

"No, for everyone, for everyone, you here alone, on the road,
will you forgive me for everyone? Speak, simple peasant heart!"

"Oh, sir! I feel afraid of driving you, your talk is so
strange."

But Mitya did not hear. He was frantically praying and muttering
to himself.
