<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>2<br/>(c) Recollections of Father Zossima's Youth before he became a<br/>Monk. The Duel<br/><br/><br/>I SPENT a long time, almost eight years, in the military cadet<br/>school at Petersburg, and in the novelty of my surroundings there,<br/>many of my childish impressions grew dimmer, though I forgot<br/>nothing. I picked up so many new habits and opinions that I was<br/>transformed into a cruel, absurd, almost savage creature. A surface<br/>polish of courtesy and society manners I did acquire together with<br/>the French language.<br/><br/>But we all, myself included, looked upon the soldiers in our<br/>service as cattle. I was perhaps worse than the rest in that<br/>respect, for I was so much more impressionable than my companions.<br/>By the time we left the school as officers, we were ready to lay<br/>down our lives for the honour of the regiment, but no one of us had<br/>any knowledge of the real meaning of honour, and if anyone had<br/>known it, he would have been the first to ridicule it. Drunkenness,<br/>debauchery and devilry were what we almost prided ourselves on. I<br/>don't say that we were bad by nature, all these young men were good<br/>fellows, but they behaved badly, and I worst of all. What made it<br/>worse for me was that I had come into my own money, and so I flung<br/>myself into a life of pleasure, and plunged headlong into all the<br/>recklessness of youth.<br/><br/>I was fond of reading, yet strange to say, the Bible was the one<br/>book I never opened at that time, though I always carried it about<br/>with me, and I was never separated from it; in very truth I was<br/>keeping that book "for the day and the hour, for the month and the<br/>year," though I knew it not.<br/><br/>After four years of this life, I chanced to be in the town of K.<br/>where our regiment was stationed at the time. We found the people<br/>of the town hospitable, rich, and fond of entertainments. I met<br/>with a cordial reception everywhere, as I was of a lively<br/>temperament and was known to be well off, which always goes a long<br/>way in the world. And then a circumstance happened which was the<br/>beginning of it all.<br/><br/>I formed an attachment to a beautiful and intelligent young girl<br/>of noble and lofty character, the daughter of people much<br/>respected. They were well-to-do people of influence and position.<br/>They always gave me a cordial and friendly reception. I fancied<br/>that the young lady looked on me with favour and my heart was<br/>aflame at such an idea. Later on I saw and fully realised that I<br/>perhaps was not so passionately in love with her at all, but only<br/>recognised the elevation of her mind and character, which I could<br/>not indeed have helped doing. I was prevented, however, from making<br/>her an offer at the time by my selfishness; I was loath to part<br/>with the allurements of my free and licentious bachelor life in the<br/>heyday of my youth, and with my pockets full of money. I did drop<br/>some hint as to my feelings however, though I put off taking any<br/>decisive step for a time. Then, all of a sudden, we were ordered<br/>off for two months to another district.<br/><br/>On my return two months later, I found the young lady already<br/>married to a rich neighbouring landowner, a very amiable man, still<br/>young though older than I was, connected with the best Petersburg<br/>society, which I was not, and of excellent education, which I also<br/>was not. I was so overwhelmed at this unexpected circumstance that<br/>my mind was positively clouded. The worst of it all was that, as I<br/>learned then, the young landowner had been a long while betrothed<br/>to her, and I had met him indeed many times in her house, but<br/>blinded by my conceit I had noticed nothing. And this particularly<br/>mortified me; almost everybody had known all about it, while I knew<br/>nothing. I was filled with sudden irrepressible fury. With flushed<br/>face I began recalling how often I had been on the point of<br/>declaring my love to her, and as she had not attempted to stop me<br/>or to warn me, she must, I concluded, have been laughing at me all<br/>the time. Later on, of course, I reflected and remembered that she<br/>had been very far from laughing at me; on the contrary, she used to<br/>turn off any love-making on my part with a jest and begin talking<br/>of other subjects; but at that moment I was incapable of reflecting<br/>and was all eagerness for revenge. I am surprised to remember that<br/>my wrath and revengeful feelings were extremely repugnant to my own<br/>nature, for being of an easy temper, I found it difficult to be<br/>angry with anyone for long, and so I had to work myself up<br/>artificially and became at last revolting and absurd.<br/><br/>I waited for an opportunity and succeeded in insulting my<br/>"rival" in the presence of a large company. I insulted him on a<br/>perfectly extraneous pretext, jeering at his opinion upon an<br/>important public event- it was in the year 1826- my jeer was, so<br/>people said, clever and effective. Then I forced him to ask for an<br/>explanation, and behaved so rudely that he accepted my challenge in<br/>spite of the vast inequality between us, as I was younger, a person<br/>of no consequence, and of inferior rank. I learned afterwards for a<br/>fact that it was from a jealous feeling on his side also that my<br/>challenge was accepted; he had been rather jealous of me on his<br/>wife's account before their marriage; he fancied now that if he<br/>submitted to be insulted by me and refused to accept my challenge,<br/>and if she heard of it, she might begin to despise him and waver in<br/>her love for him. I soon found a second in a comrade, an ensign of<br/>our regiment. In those days though duels were severely punished,<br/>yet duelling was a kind of fashion among the officers- so strong<br/>and deeply rooted will a brutal prejudice sometimes be.<br/>
