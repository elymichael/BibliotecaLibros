<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>2<br/>The Injured Foot<br/><br/><br/>THE first of these things was at the house of Madame Hohlakov,<br/>and he hurried there to get it over as quickly as possible and not<br/>be too late for Mitya. Madame Hohlakov had been slightly ailing for<br/>the last three weeks: her foot had for some reason swollen up, and<br/>though she was not in bed, she lay all day half-reclining on the<br/>couch in her boudoir, in a fascinating but decorous deshabille.<br/>Alyosha had once noted with innocent amusement that, in spite of<br/>her illness, Madame Hohlakov had begun to be rather dressy-<br/>topknots, ribbons, loose wrappers had made their appearance, and he<br/>had an inkling of the reason, though he dismissed such ideas from<br/>his mind as frivolous. During the last two months the young<br/>official, Perhotin, had become a regular visitor at the house.<br/><br/>Alyosha had not called for four days and he was in haste to go<br/>straight to Lise, as it was with her he had to speak, for Lise had<br/>sent a maid to him the previous day specially asking him to come to<br/>her "about something very important," a request which, for certain<br/>reasons, had interest for Alyosha. But while the maid went to take<br/>his name in to Lise, Madame Hohlakov heard of his arrival from<br/>someone, and immediately sent to beg him to come to her "just for<br/>one minute." Alyosha reflected that it was better to accede to the<br/>mamma's request, or else she would be sending down to Lise's room<br/>every minute that he was there. Madame Hohlakov was lying on a<br/>couch. She was particularly smartly dressed and was evidently in a<br/>state of extreme nervous excitement. She greeted Alyosha with cries<br/>of rapture.<br/><br/>"It's ages, ages, perfect ages since I've seen you! It's a whole<br/>week- only think of it! Ah, but you were here only four days ago,<br/>on Wednesday. You have come to see Lise. I'm sure you meant to slip<br/>into her room on tiptoe, without my hearing you. My dear, dear<br/>Alexey Fyodorovitch, if you only knew how worried I am about her!<br/>But of that later, though that's the most important thing, of that<br/>later. Dear Alexey Fyodorovitch, I trust you implicitly with my<br/>Lise. Since the death of Father Zossima- God rest his soul!" (she<br/>crossed herself)- "I look upon you as a monk, though you look<br/>charming in your new suit. Where did you find such a tailor in<br/>these parts? No, no, that's not the chief thing- of that later.<br/>Forgive me for sometimes calling you Alyosha; an old woman like me<br/>may take liberties," she smiled coquettishly; "but that will do<br/>later, too. The important thing is that I shouldn't forget what is<br/>important. Please remind me of it yourself. As soon as my tongue<br/>runs away with me, you just say 'the important thing?' Ach! how do<br/>I know now what is of most importance? Ever since Lise took back<br/>her promise- her childish promise, Alexey Fyodorovitch- to marry<br/>you, you've realised, of course, that it was only the playful fancy<br/>of a sick child who had been so long confined to her chair- thank<br/>God, she can walk now!… that-new doctor Katya sent for from Moscow<br/>for your unhappy brother, who will to-morrow- but why speak of<br/>to-morrow? I am ready to die at the very thought of to-morrow.<br/>Ready to die of curiosity… . That doctor was with us yesterday and<br/>saw Lise… . I paid him fifty roubles for the visit. But that's not<br/>the point, that's not the point again. You see, I'm mixing<br/>everything up. I am in such a hurry. Why am I in a hurry? I don't<br/>understand. It's awful how I seem growing unable to understand<br/>anything. Everything seems mixed up in a sort of tangle. I am<br/>afraid you are so bored you will jump up and run away, and that<br/>will be all I shall see of you. Goodness! Why are we sitting here<br/>and no coffee? Yulia, Glafira, coffee!"<br/><br/>Alyosha made haste to thank her, and said that he had only just<br/>had coffee.<br/><br/>"Where?"<br/><br/>"At Agrfena Alexandrovna's."<br/><br/>"At… at that woman's? Ah, it's she has brought ruin on everyone.<br/>I know nothing about it though. They say she has become a saint,<br/>though it's rather late in the day. She had better have done it<br/>before. What use is it now? Hush, hush, Alexey Fyodorovitch, for I<br/>have so much to say to you that I am afraid I shall tell you<br/>nothing. This awful trial… I shall certainly go, I am making<br/>arrangements. I shall be carried there in my chair; besides I can<br/>sit up. I shall have people with me. And, you know, I am a witness.<br/>How shall I speak, how shall I speak? I don't know what I shall<br/>say. One has to take an oath, hasn't one?"<br/>
