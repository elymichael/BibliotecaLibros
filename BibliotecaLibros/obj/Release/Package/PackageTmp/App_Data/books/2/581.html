<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>14<br/>The Peasants Stand Firm<br/><br/><br/>THIS was how Fetyukovitch concluded his speech, and the<br/>enthusiasm of the audience burst like an irresistible storm. It was<br/>out of the question to stop it: the women wept, many of the men<br/>wept too, even two important personages shed tears. The President<br/>submitted, and even postponed ringing his bell. The suppression of<br/>such an enthusiasm would be the suppression of something sacred, as<br/>the ladies cried afterwards. The orator himself was genuinely<br/>touched.<br/><br/>And it was at this moment that Ippolit Kirillovitch got up to<br/>make certain objections. People looked at him with hatred. "What?<br/>What's the meaning of it? He positively dares to make objections,"<br/>the ladies babbled. But if the whole world of ladies, including his<br/>wife, had protested he could not have been stopped at that moment.<br/>He was pale, he was shaking with emotion, his first phrases were<br/>even unintelligible, he gasped for breath, could hardly speak<br/>clearly, lost the thread. But he soon recovered himself. Of this<br/>new speech of his I will quote only a few sentences.<br/><br/>"… I am reproached with having woven a romance. But what is this<br/>defence if not one romance on the top of another? All that was<br/>lacking was poetry. Fyodor Pavlovitch, while waiting for his<br/>mistress, tears open the envelope and throws it on the floor. We<br/>are even told what he said while engaged in this strange act. Is<br/>not this a flight of fancy? And what proof have we that he had<br/>taken out the money? Who heard what he said? The weak-minded idiot,<br/>Smerdyakov, transformed into a Byronic hero, avenging society for<br/>his illegitimate birth- isn't this a romance in the Byronic style?<br/>And the son who breaks into his father's house and murders him<br/>without murdering him is not even a romance- this is a sphinx<br/>setting us a riddle which he cannot solve himself. If he murdered<br/>him, he murdered him, and what's the meaning of his murdering him<br/>without having murdered him- who can make head or tail of this?<br/><br/>"Then we are admonished that our tribune is a tribune of true<br/>and sound ideas and from this tribune of 'sound ideas' is heard a<br/>solemn declaration that to call the murder of a father 'parricide'<br/>is nothing but a prejudice! But if parricide is a prejudice, and if<br/>every child is to ask his father why he is to love him, what will<br/>become of us? What will become of the foundations of society? What<br/>will become of the family? Parricide, it appears, is only a bogy of<br/>Moscow merchants' wives. The most precious, the most sacred<br/>guarantees for the destiny and future of Russian justice are<br/>presented to us in a perverted and frivolous form, simply to attain<br/>an object- to obtain the justification of something which cannot be<br/>justified. 'Oh, crush him by mercy,' cries the counsel for the<br/>defence; but that's all the criminal wants, and to-morrow it will<br/>be seen how much he is crushed. And is not the counsel for the<br/>defence too modest in asking only for the acquittal of the<br/>prisoner? Why not found a charity in the honour of the parricide to<br/>commemorate his exploit among future generations? Religion and the<br/>Gospel are corrected- that's all mysticism, we are told, and ours<br/>is the only true Christianity which has been subjected to the<br/>analysis of reason and common sense. And so they set up before us a<br/>false semblance of Christ! 'What measure ye mete so it shall be<br/>meted unto you again,' cried the counsel for the defence, and<br/>instantly deduces that Christ teaches us to measure as it is<br/>measured to us and this from the tribune of truth and sound sense!<br/>We peep into the Gospel only on the eve of making speeches, in<br/>order to dazzle the audience by our acquaintance with what is,<br/>anyway, a rather original composition, which may be of use to<br/>produce a certain effect- all to serve the purpose! But what Christ<br/>commands us is something very different: He bids us beware of doing<br/>this, because the wicked world does this, but we ought to forgive<br/>and to turn the other cheek, and not to measure to our persecutors<br/>as they measure to us. This is what our God has taught us and not<br/>that to forbid children to murder their fathers is a prejudice. And<br/>we will not from the tribune of truth and good sense correct the<br/>Gospel of our Lord, Whom the counsel for the defence deigns to call<br/>only 'the crucified lover of humanity,' in opposition to all<br/>orthodox Russia, which calls to Him, 'For Thou art our God!'"<br/><br/>At this the President intervened and checked the over-zealous<br/>speaker, begging him not to exaggerate, not to overstep the bounds,<br/>and so on, as presidents always do in such cases. The audience,<br/>too, was uneasy. The public was restless: there were even<br/>exclamations of indignation. Fetyukovitch did not so much as reply;<br/>he only mounted the tribune to lay his hand on his heart and, with<br/>an offended voice, utter a few words full of dignity. He only<br/>touched again, lightly and ironically, on "romancing" and<br/>"psychology," and in an appropriate place quoted, "Jupiter, you are<br/>angry, therefore you are wrong," which provoked a burst of<br/>approving laughter in the audience, for Ippolit Kirillovitch was by<br/>no means like Jupiter. Then, a propos of the accusation that he was<br/>teaching the young generation to murder their fathers, Fetyukovitch<br/>observed, with great dignity, that he would not even answer. As for<br/>the prosecutor's charge of uttering unorthodox opinions,<br/>Fetyukovitch hinted that it was a personal insinuation and that he<br/>had expected in this court to be secure from accusations "damaging<br/>to my reputation as a citizen and a loyal subject." But at these<br/>words the President pulled him up, too, and Fetyukovitch concluded<br/>his speech with a bow, amid a hum of approbation in the court. And<br/>Ippolit Kirillovitch was, in the opinion of our ladies, "crushed<br/>for good."<br/><br/>Then the prisoner was allowed to speak. Mitya stood up, but said<br/>very little. He was fearfully exhausted, physically and mentally.<br/>The look of strength and independence with which he had entered in<br/>the morning had almost disappeared. He seemed as though he had<br/>passed through an experience that day, which had taught him for the<br/>rest of his life something very important he had not understood<br/>till then. His voice was weak, he did not shout as before. In his<br/>words there was a new note of humility, defeat and submission.<br/><br/>"What am I to say, gentlemen of the jury? The hour of judgment<br/>has come for me, I feel the hand of God upon me! The end has come<br/>to an erring man! But, before God, I repeat to you, I am innocent<br/>of my father's blood! For the last time I repeat, it wasn't I<br/>killed him! I was erring, but I loved what is good. Every instant I<br/>strove to reform, but I lived like a wild beast. I thank the<br/>prosecutor, he told me many things about myself that I did not<br/>know; but it's not true that I killed my father, the prosecutor is<br/>mistaken. I thank my counsel, too. I cried listening to him; but<br/>it's not true that I killed my father, and he needn't have supposed<br/>it. And don't believe the doctors. I am perfectly sane, only my<br/>heart is heavy. If you spare me, if you let me go, I will pray for<br/>you. I will be a better man. I give you my word before God I will!<br/>And if you will condemn me, I'll break my sword over my head myself<br/>and kiss the pieces. But spare me, do not rob me of my God! I know<br/>myself, I shall rebel! My heart is heavy, gentlemen… spare me!"<br/>
