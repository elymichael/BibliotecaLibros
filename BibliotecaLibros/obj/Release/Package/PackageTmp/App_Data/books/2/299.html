<br/>"Good-bye, Pyotr Ilyitch! My last tear is for you!… "<br/><br/>"He's not drunk, but he keeps babbling like a lunatic," Pyotr<br/>Ilyitch thought as he watched him go. He had half a mind to stay<br/>and see the cart packed with the remaining wines and provisions,<br/>knowing that they would deceive and defraud Mitya. But, suddenly<br/>feeling vexed with himself, he turned away with a curse and went to<br/>the tavern to play billiards.<br/><br/>"He's a fool, though he's a good fellow," he muttered as he<br/>went. "I've heard of that officer, Grushenka's former flame. Well,<br/>if he has turned up… . Ech, those pistols! Damn it all! I'm not his<br/>nurse! Let them do what they like! Besides, it'll all come to<br/>nothing. They're a set of brawlers, that's all. They'll drink and<br/>fight, fight and make friends again. They are not men who do<br/>anything real. What does he mean by 'I'm stepping aside, I'm<br/>punishing myself'? It'll come to nothing! He's shouted such phrases<br/>a thousand times, drunk, in the taverns. But now he's not drunk.<br/>'Drunk in spirit'- they're fond of fine phrases, the villains. Am I<br/>his nurse? He must have been fighting, his face was all over blood.<br/>With whom? I shall find out at the Metropolis. And his handkerchief<br/>was soaked in blood… . It's still lying on my floor… . Hang<br/>it!"<br/><br/>He reached the tavern in a bad humour and at once made up a<br/>game. The game cheered him. He played a second game, and suddenly<br/>began telling one of his partners that Dmitri Karamazov had come in<br/>for some cash again- something like three thousand roubles, and had<br/>gone to Mokroe again to spend it with Grushenka… . This news roused<br/>singular interest in his listeners. They all spoke of it, not<br/>laughing, but with a strange gravity. They left off playing.<br/><br/>"Three thousand? But where can he have got three thousand?"<br/><br/>Questions were asked. The story of Madame Hohlakov's present was<br/>received with scepticism.<br/><br/>"Hasn't he robbed his old father?- that's the question."<br/><br/>"Three thousand! There's something odd about it."<br/><br/>"He boasted aloud that he would kill his father; we all heard<br/>him, here. And it was three thousand he talked about… "<br/><br/>Pyotr Ilyitch listened. All at once he became short and dry in<br/>his answers. He said not a word about the blood on Mitya's face and<br/>hands, though he had meant to speak of it at first.<br/><br/>
