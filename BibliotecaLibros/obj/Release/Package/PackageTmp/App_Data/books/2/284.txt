Seeing him with his face all smeared with blood, the young man
uttered a cry of surprise.

"Good heavens! What is the matter?"

"I've come for my pistols," said Mitya, "and brought you the
money. And thanks very much. I'm in a hurry, Pyotr Ilyitch, please
make haste."

Pyotr Ilyitch grew more and more surprised; he suddenly caught
sight of a bundle of banknotes in Mitya's hand, and what was more,
he had walked in holding the notes as no one walks in and no one
carries money: he had them in his right hand, and held them
outstretched as if to show them. Perhotin's servant-boy, who met
Mitya in the passage, said afterwards that he walked into the
passage in the same way, with the money outstretched in his hand,
so he must have been carrying them like that even in the streets.
They were all rainbow-coloured hundred-rouble notes, and the
fingers holding them were covered with blood.

When Pyotr Ilyitch was questioned later on as to the sum of
money, he said that it was difficult to judge at a glance, but that
it might have been two thousand, or perhaps three, but it was a
big, "fat" bundle. "Dmitri Fyodorovitch," so he testified
afterwards, "seemed unlike himself, too; not drunk, but, as it
were, exalted, lost to everything, but at the same time, as it
were, absorbed, as though pondering and searching for something and
unable to come to a decision. He was in great haste, answered
abruptly and very strangely, and at moments seemed not at all
dejected but quite cheerful."

"But what is the matter with you? What's wrong?" cried Pyotr
Ilyitch, looking wildly at his guest. "How is it that you're all
covered with blood? Have you had a fall? Look at yourself!"

He took him by the elbow and led him to the glass.

Seeing his blood-stained face, Mitya started and scowled
wrathfully.

"Damnation! That's the last straw," he muttered angrily,
hurriedly changing the notes from his right hand to the left, and
impulsively jerked the handkerchief out of his pocket. But the
handkerchief turned out to be soaked with blood, too (it was the
handkerchief he had used to wipe Grigory's face). There was
scarcely a white spot on it, and it had not merely begun to dry,
but had stiffened into a crumpled ball and could not be pulled
apart. Mitya threw it angrily on the floor.

"Oh, damn it!" he said. "Haven't you a rag of some sortâ€¦ to wipe
my face?"

"So you're only stained, not wounded? You'd better wash," said
Pyotr Ilyitch. "Here's a wash-stand. I'll pour you out some
water."
