<br/>Mitya turned, and saw that someone had, in fact, parted the<br/>curtains and seemed to be watching them. And not one person alone,<br/>it seemed.<br/><br/>He jumped up and walked quickly to the intruder.<br/><br/>"Here, come to us, come here," said a voice, speaking not<br/>loudly, but firmly and peremptorily.<br/><br/>Mitya passed to the other side of the curtain and stood stock<br/>still. The room was filled with people, but not those who had been<br/>there before. An instantaneous shiver ran down his back, and he<br/>shuddered. He recognised all those people instantly. That tall,<br/>stout old man in the overcoat and forage-cap with a cockade- was<br/>the police captain, Mihail Makarovitch. And that<br/>"consumptive-looking" trim dandy,"who always has such polished<br/>boots"- that was the deputy prosecutor. "He has a chronometer worth<br/>four hundred roubles; he showed it to me." And that small young man<br/>in spectacles… . Mitya forgot his surname though he knew him, had<br/>seen him: he was the "investigating lawyer," from the "school of<br/>jurisprudence," who had only lately come to the town. And this man-<br/>the inspector of police, Mavriky Mavrikyevitch, a man he knew well.<br/>And those fellows with the brass plates on, why are they here? And<br/>those other two… peasants… . And there at the door Kalganov with<br/>Trifon Borissovitch… .<br/><br/>"Gentlemen! What's this for, gentlemen?" began Mitya, but<br/>suddenly, as though beside himself, not knowing what he was doing,<br/>he cried aloud, at the top of his voice:<br/><br/>"I un-der-stand!"<br/><br/>The young man in spectacles moved forward suddenly, and stepping<br/>up to Mitya, began with dignity, though hurriedly:<br/><br/>"We have to make… in brief, I beg you to come this way, this way<br/>to the sofa… . It is absolutely imperative that you should give an<br/>explanation."<br/><br/>"The old man!" cried Mitya frantically. "The old man and his<br/>blood!… I understand."<br/><br/>And he sank, almost fell, on a chair close by, as though he had<br/>been mown down by a scythe.<br/><br/>
