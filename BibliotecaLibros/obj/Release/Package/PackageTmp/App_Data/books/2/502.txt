"No one can hear anything. You've seen for yourself: there's a
passage."

"Listen, my good fellow; what was that you babbled, as I was
leaving the hospital, that if I said nothing about your faculty of
shamming fits, you wouldn't tell the investigating lawyer all our
conversation at the gate? What do you mean by all? What could you
mean by it? Were you threatening me? Have I entered into some sort
of compact with you? Do you suppose I am afraid of you?"

Ivan said this in a perfect fury, giving him to understand with
obvious intention that he scorned any subterfuge or indirectness
and meant to show his cards. Smerdyakov's eyes gleamed resentfully,
his left eye winked, and he at once gave his answer, with his
habitual composure and deliberation. "You want to have everything
above-board; very well, you shall have it," he seemed to say.

"This is what I meant then, and this is why I said that, that
you, knowing beforehand of this murder of your own parent, left him
to his fate, and that people mightn't after that conclude any evil
about your feelings and perhaps of something else, too- that's what
I promised not to tell the authorities."

Though Smerdyakov spoke without haste and obviously controlling
himself, yet there was something in his voice, determined and
emphatic, resentful and insolently defiant. He stared impudently at
Ivan. A mist passed before Ivan's eyes for the first moment.

"How? What? Are you out of your mind?"

"I'm perfectly in possession of all my faculties."

"Do you suppose I knew of the murder?" Ivan cried at last, and
he brought his fist violently on the table. "What do you mean by
'something else, too'? Speak, scoundrel!"

Smerdyakov was silent and still scanned Ivan with the same
insolent stare.

"Speak, you stinking rogue, what is that 'something else,
too'?"
