<br/>"I want to destroy myself. There's a boy here, who lay down<br/>between the railway lines when the train was passing. Lucky fellow!<br/>Listen, your brother is being tried now for murdering his father<br/>and everyone loves his having killed his father."<br/><br/>"Loves his having killed his father?"<br/><br/>"Yes, loves it; everyone loves it! Everybody says it's so awful,<br/>but secretly they simply love it. I for one love it."<br/><br/>"There is some truth in what you say about everyone," said<br/>Alyosha softly.<br/><br/>"Oh, what ideas you have!" Lise shrieked in delight. "And you a<br/>monk, too! You wouldn't believe how I respect you, Alyosha, for<br/>never telling lies. Oh, I must tell you a funny dream of mine. I<br/>sometimes dream of devils. It's night; I am in my room with a<br/>candle and suddenly there are devils all over the place, in all the<br/>corners, under the table, and they open the doors; there's a crowd<br/>of them behind the doors and they want to come and seize me. And<br/>they are just coming, just seizing me. But I suddenly cross myself<br/>and they all draw back, though they don't go away altogether, they<br/>stand at the doors and in the corners, waiting. And suddenly I have<br/>a frightful longing to revile God aloud, and so I begin, and then<br/>they come crowding back to me, delighted, and seize me again and I<br/>cross myself again and they all draw back. It's awful fun, it takes<br/>one's breath away."<br/><br/>"I've had the same dream, too," said Alyosha suddenly.<br/><br/>"Really?" cried Lise, surprised. "I say, Alyosha, don't laugh,<br/>that's awfully important. Could two different people have the same<br/>dream?"<br/><br/>"It seems they can."<br/><br/>"Alyosha, I tell you, it's awfully important," Lise went on,<br/>with really excessive amazement. "It's not the dream that's<br/>important, but your having the same dream as me. You never lie to<br/>me, don't lie now; is it true? You are not laughing?"<br/><br/>"It's true."<br/><br/>
