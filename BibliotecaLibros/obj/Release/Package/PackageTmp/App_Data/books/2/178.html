<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>4<br/>Rebellion<br/><br/><br/>"I MUST make one confession" Ivan began. "I could never<br/>understand how one can love one's neighbours. It's just one's<br/>neighbours, to my mind, that one can't love, though one might love<br/>those at a distance. I once read somewhere of John the Merciful, a<br/>saint, that when a hungry, frozen beggar came to him, he took him<br/>into his bed, held him in his arms, and began breathing into his<br/>mouth, which was putrid and loathsome from some awful disease. I am<br/>convinced that he did that from 'self-laceration,' from the<br/>self-laceration of falsity, for the sake of the charity imposed by<br/>duty, as a penance laid on him. For anyone to love a man, he must<br/>be hidden, for as soon as he shows his face, love is gone."<br/><br/>"Father Zossima has talked of that more than once," observed<br/>Alyosha; "he, too, said that the face of a man often hinders many<br/>people not practised in love, from loving him. But yet there's a<br/>great deal of love in mankind, and almost Christ-like love. I know<br/>that myself, Ivan."<br/><br/>"Well, I know nothing of it so far, and can't understand it, and<br/>the innumerable mass of mankind are with me there. The question is,<br/>whether that's due to men's bad qualities or whether it's inherent<br/>in their nature. To my thinking, Christ-like love for men is a<br/>miracle impossible on earth. He was God. But we are not gods.<br/>Suppose I, for instance, suffer intensely. Another can never know<br/>how much I suffer, because he is another and not I. And what's<br/>more, a man is rarely ready to admit another's suffering (as though<br/>it were a distinction). Why won't he admit it, do you think?<br/>Because I smell unpleasant, because I have a stupid face, because I<br/>once trod on his foot. Besides, there is suffering and suffering;<br/>degrading, humiliating suffering such as humbles me- hunger, for<br/>instance- my benefactor will perhaps allow me; but when you come to<br/>higher suffering- for an idea, for instance- he will very rarely<br/>admit that, perhaps because my face strikes him as not at all what<br/>he fancies a man should have who suffers for an idea. And so he<br/>deprives me instantly of his favour, and not at all from badness of<br/>heart. Beggars, especially genteel beggars, ought never to show<br/>themselves, but to ask for charity through the newspapers. One can<br/>love one's neighbours in the abstract, or even at a distance, but<br/>at close quarters it's almost impossible. If it were as on the<br/>stage, in the ballet, where if beggars come in, they wear silken<br/>rags and tattered lace and beg for alms dancing gracefully, then<br/>one might like looking at them. But even then we should not love<br/>them. But enough of that. I simply wanted to show you my point of<br/>view. I meant to speak of the suffering of mankind generally, but<br/>we had better confine ourselves to the sufferings of the children.<br/>That reduces the scope of my argument to a tenth of what it would<br/>be. Still we'd better keep to the children, though it does weaken<br/>my case. But, in the first place, children can be loved even at<br/>close quarters, even when they are dirty, even when they are ugly<br/>(I fancy, though, children never are ugly). The second reason why I<br/>won't speak of grown-up people is that, besides being disgusting<br/>and unworthy of love, they have a compensation- they've eaten the<br/>apple and know good and evil, and they have become 'like gods.'<br/>They go on eating it still. But the children haven't eaten<br/>anything, and are so far innocent. Are you fond of children,<br/>Alyosha? I know you are, and you will understand why I prefer to<br/>speak of them. If they, too, suffer horribly on earth, they must<br/>suffer for their fathers' sins, they must be punished for their<br/>fathers, who have eaten the apple; but that reasoning is of the<br/>other world and is incomprehensible for the heart of man here on<br/>earth. The innocent must not suffer for another's sins, and<br/>especially such innocents! You may be surprised at me, Alyosha, but<br/>I am awfully fond of children, too. And observe, cruel people, the<br/>violent, the rapacious, the Karamazovs are sometimes very fond of<br/>children. Children while they are quite little- up to seven, for<br/>instance- are so remote from grown-up people they are different<br/>creatures, as it were, of a different species. I knew a criminal in<br/>prison who had, in the course of his career as a burglar, murdered<br/>whole families, including several children. But when he was in<br/>prison, he had a strange affection for them. He spent all his time<br/>at his window, watching the children playing in the prison yard. He<br/>trained one little boy to come up to his window and made great<br/>friends with himâ€¦ . You don't know why I am telling you all this,<br/>Alyosha? My head aches and I am sad."<br/><br/>"You speak with a strange air," observed Alyosha uneasily, "as<br/>though you were not quite yourself."<br/><br/>"By the way, a Bulgarian I met lately in Moscow," Ivan went on,<br/>seeming not to hear his brother's words, "told me about the crimes<br/>committed by Turks and Circassians in all parts of Bulgaria through<br/>fear of a general rising of the Slavs. They burn villages, murder,<br/>outrage women and children, they nail their prisoners by the ears<br/>to the fences, leave them so till morning, and in the morning they<br/>hang them- all sorts of things you can't imagine. People talk<br/>sometimes of bestial cruelty, but that's a great injustice and<br/>insult to the beasts; a beast can never be so cruel as a man, so<br/>artistically cruel. The tiger only tears and gnaws, that's all he<br/>can do. He would never think of nailing people by the ears, even if<br/>he were able to do it. These Turks took a pleasure in torturing<br/>children, -too; cutting the unborn child from the mothers womb, and<br/>tossing babies up in the air and catching them on the points of<br/>their bayonets before their mothers' eyes. Doing it before the<br/>mothers' eyes was what gave zest to the amusement. Here is another<br/>scene that I thought very interesting. Imagine a trembling mother<br/>with her baby in her arms, a circle of invading Turks around her.<br/>They've planned a diversion: they pet the baby, laugh to make it<br/>laugh. They succeed, the baby laughs. At that moment a Turk points<br/>a pistol four inches from the baby's face. The baby laughs with<br/>glee, holds out its little hands to the pistol, and he pulls the<br/>trigger in the baby's face and blows out its brains. Artistic,<br/>wasn't it? By the way, Turks are particularly fond of sweet things,<br/>they say."<br/><br/>"Brother, what are you driving at?" asked Alyosha.<br/><br/>"I think if the devil doesn't exist, but man has created him, he<br/>has created him in his own image and likeness."<br/>
