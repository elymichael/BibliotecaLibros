<br/>"What Piron?" cried Mitya.<br/><br/>"The famous French writer, Piron. We were all drinking then, a<br/>big party of us, in a tavern at that very fair. They'd invited me,<br/>and first of all I began quoting epigrams. 'Is that you, Boileau?<br/>What a funny get-up!' and Boileau answers that he's going to a<br/>masquerade, that is to the baths, he he! And they took it to<br/>themselves, so I made haste to repeat another, very sarcastic, well<br/>known to all educated people:<br/><br/>Yes, Sappho and Phaon are we!<br/><br/>But one grief is weighing on me.<br/><br/>You don't know your way to the sea!<br/><br/>"They were still more offended and began abusing me in the most<br/>unseemly way for it. And as ill-luck would have it, to set things<br/>right, I began telling a very cultivated anecdote about Piron, how<br/>he was not accepted into the French Academy, and to revenge himself<br/>wrote his own epitaph:<br/><br/>Ci-git Piron qui ne fut rien,<br/><br/>Pas meme academicien,*<br/><br/>* Here lies Piron, who was nothing, not even an Academician.<br/><br/>They seized me and thrashed me."<br/><br/>
