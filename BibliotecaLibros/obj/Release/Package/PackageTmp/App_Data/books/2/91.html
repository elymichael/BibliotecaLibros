"Stay, Smerdyakov, be quiet a minute," cried Fyodor Pavlovitch<br/>once more. "Ivan, your ear again."<br/><br/>Ivan bent down again with a perfectly grave face.<br/><br/>"I love you as I do Alyosha. Don't think I don't love you. Some<br/>brandy?"<br/><br/>"Yes.- But you're rather drunk yourself," thought Ivan, looking<br/>steadily at his father.<br/><br/>He was watching Smerdyakov with great curiosity.<br/><br/>"You're anathema accursed, as it is, Grigory suddenly burst out,<br/>"and how dare you argue, you rascal, after that, if- "<br/><br/>"Don't scold him, Grigory, don't scold him," Fyodor Pavlovitch<br/>cut him short.<br/><br/>"You should wait, Grigory Vassilyevitch, if only a short time,<br/>and listen, for I haven't finished all I had to say. For at the<br/>very moment I become accursed, at that same highest moment, I<br/>become exactly like a heathen, and my christening is taken off me<br/>and becomes of no avail. Isn't that so?"<br/><br/>"Make haste and finish, my boy," Fyodor Pavlovitch urged him,<br/>sipping from his wineglass with relish.<br/><br/>"And if I've ceased to be a Christian, then I told no lie to the<br/>enemy when they asked whether I was a Christian or not a Christian,<br/>seeing I had already been relieved by God Himself of my<br/>Christianity by reason of the thought alone, before I had time to<br/>utter a word to the enemy. And if I have already been discharged,<br/>in what manner and with what sort of justice can I be held<br/>responsible as a Christian in the other world for having denied<br/>Christ, when, through the very thought alone, before denying Him I<br/>had been relieved from my christening? If I'm no longer a<br/>Christian, then I can't renounce Christ, for I've nothing then to<br/>renounce. Who will hold an unclean Tatar responsible, Grigory<br/>Vassilyevitch, even in heaven, for not having been born a<br/>Christian? And who would punish him for that, considering that you<br/>can't take two skins off one ox? For God Almighty Himself, even if<br/>He did make the Tatar responsible, when he dies would give him the<br/>smallest possible punishment, I imagine (since he must be<br/>punished), judging that he is not to blame if he has come into the<br/>world an unclean heathen, from heathen parents. The Lord God can't<br/>surely take a Tatar and say he was a Christian? That would mean<br/>that the Almighty would tell a real untruth. And can the Lord of<br/>Heaven and earth tell a lie, even in one word?"<br/><br/>Grigory was thunderstruck and looked at the orator, his eyes<br/>nearly starting out of his head. Though he did not clearly<br/>understand what was said, he had caught something in this<br/>rigmarole, and stood, looking like a man who has just hit his head<br/>against a wall. Fyodor Pavlovitch emptied his glass and went off<br/>into his shrill laugh.<br/>
