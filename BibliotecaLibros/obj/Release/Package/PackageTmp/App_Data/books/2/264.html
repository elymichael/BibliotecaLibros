<br/>Mitya at once began talking to him, too, of his plans, nervously<br/>and excitedly asking advice in regard to Lyagavy, and talking all<br/>the way. The priest listened attentively, but gave little advice.<br/>He turned off Mitya's questions with: "I don't know. Ah, I can't<br/>say. How can I tell?" and so on. When Mitya began to speak of his<br/>quarrel with his father over his inheritance, the priest was<br/>positively alarmed, as he was in some way dependent on Fyodor<br/>Pavlovitch. He inquired, however, with surprise, why he called the<br/>peasant-trader Gorstkin, Lyagavy, and obligingly explained to Mitya<br/>that, though the man's name really was Lyagavy, he was never called<br/>so, as he would be grievously offended at the name, and that he<br/>must be sure to call him Gorstkin, "or you'll do nothing with him;<br/>he won't even listen to you," said the priest in conclusion.<br/><br/>Mitya was somewhat surprised for a moment, and explained that<br/>that was what Samsonov had called him. On hearing this fact, the<br/>priest dropped the subject, though he would have done well to put<br/>into words his doubt whether, if Samsonov had sent him to that<br/>peasant, calling him Lyagavy, there was not something wrong about<br/>it and he was turning him into ridicule. But Mitya had no time to<br/>pause over such trifles. He hurried, striding along, and only when<br/>he reached Suhoy Possyolok did he realise that they had come not<br/>one verst, nor one and a half, but at least three. This annoyed<br/>him, but he controlled himself.<br/><br/>They went into the hut. The forester lived in one half of the<br/>hut, and Gorstkin was lodging in the other, the better room the<br/>other side of the passage. They went into that room and lighted a<br/>tallow candle. The hut was extremely overheated. On the table there<br/>was a samovar that had gone out, a tray with cups, an empty rum<br/>bottle, a bottle of vodka partly full, and some half-eaten crusts<br/>of wheaten bread. The visitor himself lay stretched at full length<br/>on the bench, with his coat crushed up under his head for a pillow,<br/>snoring heavily. Mitya stood in perplexity.<br/><br/>"Of course, I must wake him. My business is too important. I've<br/>come in such haste. I'm in a hurry to get back to-day," he said in<br/>great agitation. But the priest and the forester stood in silence,<br/>not giving their opinion. Mitya went up and began trying to wake<br/>him himself; he tried vigorously, but the sleeper did not wake.<br/><br/>"He's drunk," Mitya decided. "Good Lord! What am I to do? What<br/>am I to do?" And, terribly impatient, he began pulling him by the<br/>arms, by the legs, shaking his head, lifting him up and making him<br/>sit on the bench. Yet, after prolonged exertions, he could only<br/>succeed in getting the drunken man to utter absurd grunts, and<br/>violent, but inarticulate oaths.<br/><br/>"No, you'd better wait a little," the priest pronounced at last,<br/>"for he's obviously not in a fit state."<br/><br/>"He's been drinking the whole day," the forester chimed in.<br/><br/>"Good heavens!" cried Mitya. "If only you knew how important it<br/>is to me and how desperate I am!"<br/><br/>"No, you'd better wait till morning," the priest repeated.<br/><br/>"Till morning? Mercy! that's impossible!" And in his despair he<br/>was on the point of attacking the sleeping man again, but stopped<br/>short at once, realising the uselessness of his efforts. The priest<br/>said nothing, the sleepy forester looked gloomy.<br/><br/>
