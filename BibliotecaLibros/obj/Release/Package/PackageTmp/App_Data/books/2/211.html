"What do you mean by isolation?" I asked him.<br/><br/>"Why, the isolation that prevails everywhere, above all in our<br/>age- it has not fully developed, it has not reached its limit yet.<br/>For everyone strives to keep his individuality as apart as<br/>possible, wishes to secure the greatest possible fullness of life<br/>for himself; but meantime all his efforts result not in attaining<br/>fullness of life but self-destruction, for instead of<br/>self-realisation he ends by arriving at complete solitude. All<br/>mankind in our age have split up into units, they all keep apart,<br/>each in his own groove; each one holds aloof, hides himself and<br/>hides what he has, from the rest, and he ends by being repelled by<br/>others and repelling them. He heaps up riches by himself and<br/>thinks, 'How strong I am now and how secure,' and in his madness he<br/>does not understand that the more he heaps up, the more he sinks<br/>into self-destructive impotence. For he is accustomed to rely upon<br/>himself alone and to cut himself off from the whole; he has trained<br/>himself not to believe in the help of others, in men and in<br/>humanity, and only trembles for fear he should lose his money and<br/>the privileges that he has won for himself. Everywhere in these<br/>days men have, in their mockery, ceased to understand that the true<br/>security is to be found in social solidarity rather than in<br/>isolated individual effort. But this terrible individualism must<br/>inevitably have an end, and all will suddenly understand how<br/>unnaturally they are separated from one another. It will be the<br/>spirit of the time, and people will marvel that they have sat so<br/>long in darkness without seeing the light. And then the sign of the<br/>Son of Man will be seen in the heavens… . But, until then, we must<br/>keep the banner flying. Sometimes even if he has to do it alone,<br/>and his conduct seems to be crazy, a man must set an example, and<br/>so draw men's souls out of their solitude, and spur them to some<br/>act of brotherly love, that the great idea may not die."<br/><br/>Our evenings, one after another, were spent in such stirring and<br/>fervent talk. I gave up society and visited my neighbours much less<br/>frequently. Besides, my vogue was somewhat over. I say this, not as<br/>blame, for they still loved me and treated me good-humouredly, but<br/>there's no denying that fashion is a great power in society. I<br/>began to regard my mysterious visitor with admiration, for besides<br/>enjoying his intelligence, I began to perceive that he was brooding<br/>over some plan in his heart, and was preparing himself perhaps for<br/>a great deed. Perhaps he liked my not showing curiosity about his<br/>secret, not seeking to discover it by direct question nor by<br/>insinuation. But I noticed at last, that he seemed to show signs of<br/>wanting to tell me something. This had become quite evident,<br/>indeed, about a month after he first began to visit me.<br/><br/>"Do you know," he said to me once, "that people are very<br/>inquisitive about us in the town and wonder why I come to see you<br/>so often. But let them wonder, for soon all will be explained."<br/><br/>Sometimes an extraordinary agitation would come over him, and<br/>almost always on such occasions he would get up and go away.<br/>Sometimes he would fix a long piercing look upon me, and I thought,<br/>"He will say something directly now." But he would suddenly begin<br/>talking of something ordinary and familiar. He often complained of<br/>headache too.<br/><br/>One day, quite unexpectedly indeed, after he had been talking<br/>with great fervour a long time, I saw him suddenly turn pale, and<br/>his face worked convulsively, while he stared persistently at<br/>me.<br/><br/>"What's the matter?" I said; "do you feel ill?"- he had just<br/>been complaining of headache.<br/><br/>"I… do you know… I murdered someone."<br/><br/>He said this and smiled with a face as white as chalk. "Why is<br/>it he is smiling?" The thought flashed through my mind before I<br/>realised anything else. I too turned pale.<br/><br/>"What are you saying?" I cried.<br/><br/>"You see," he said, with a pale smile, "how much it has cost me<br/>to say the first word. Now I have said it, I feel I've taken the<br/>first step and shall go on."<br/>
