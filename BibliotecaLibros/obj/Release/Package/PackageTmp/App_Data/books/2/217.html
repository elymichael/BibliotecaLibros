"You sit down, too," said he.<br/><br/>I sat down. We sat still for two minutes; he looked intently at<br/>me and suddenly smiled. I remembered that- then he got up, embraced<br/>me warmly and kissed me.<br/><br/>"Remember," he said, "how I came to you a second time. Do you<br/>hear, remember it!"<br/><br/>And he went out.<br/><br/>"To-morrow," I thought.<br/><br/>And so it was. I did not know that evening that the next day was<br/>his birthday. I had not been out for the last few days, so I had no<br/>chance of hearing it from anyone. On that day he always had a great<br/>gathering, everyone in the town went to it. It was the same this<br/>time. After dinner he walked into the middle of the room, with a<br/>paper in his hand- a formal declaration to the chief of his<br/>department who was present. This declaration he read aloud to the<br/>whole assembly. It contained a full account of the crime, in every<br/>detail.<br/><br/>"I cut myself off from men as a monster. God has visited me," he<br/>said in conclusion. "I want to suffer for my sin!"<br/><br/>Then he brought out and laid on the table all the things he had<br/>been keeping for fourteen years, that he thought would prove his<br/>crime, the jewels belonging to the murdered woman which he had<br/>stolen to divert suspicion, a cross and a locket taken from her<br/>neck with a portrait of her betrothed in the locket, her notebook<br/>and two letters; one from her betrothed, telling her that he would<br/>soon be with her, and her unfinished answer left on the table to be<br/>sent off next day. He carried off these two letters- what for? Why<br/>had he kept them for fourteen years afterwards instead of<br/>destroying them as evidence against him?<br/><br/>And this is what happened: everyone was amazed and horrified,<br/>everyone refused to believe it and thought that he was deranged,<br/>though all listened with intense curiosity. A few days later it was<br/>fully decided and agreed in every house that the unhappy man was<br/>mad. The legal authorities could not refuse to take the case up,<br/>but they too dropped it. Though the trinkets and letters made them<br/>ponder, they decided that even if they did turn out to be<br/>authentic, no charge could be based on those alone. Besides, she<br/>might have given him those things as a friend, or asked him to take<br/>care of them for her. I heard afterwards, however, that the<br/>genuineness of the things was proved by the friends and relations<br/>of the murdered woman, and that there was no doubt about them. Yet<br/>nothing was destined to come of it, after all.<br/><br/>Five days later, all had heard that he was ill and that his life<br/>was in danger. The nature of his illness I can't explain; they said<br/>it was an affection of the heart. But it became known that the<br/>doctors had been induced by his wife to investigate his mental<br/>condition also, and had come to the conclusion that it was a case<br/>of insanity. I betrayed nothing, though people ran to question me.<br/>But when I wanted to visit him, I was for a long while forbidden to<br/>do so, above all by his wife.<br/><br/>"It's you who have caused his illness," she said to me; "he was<br/>always gloomy, but for the last year people noticed that he was<br/>peculiarly excited and did strange things, and now you have been<br/>the ruin of him. Your preaching has brought him to this; for the<br/>last month he was always with you."<br/>
