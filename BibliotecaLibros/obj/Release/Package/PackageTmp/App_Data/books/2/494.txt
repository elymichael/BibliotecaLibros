Ivan felt suddenly angry.

"No, I haven't yet, but I certainly shall. You must explain a
great deal to me, my man; and let me tell you, I am not going to
let you play with me!"

"Why should I play with you, when I put my whole trust in you,
as in God Almighty?" said Smerdyakov, with the same composure, only
for a moment closing his eyes.

"In the first place," began Ivan, "I know that epileptic fits
can't be told beforehand. I've inquired; don't try and take me in.
You can't foretell the day and the hour. How was it you told me the
day and the hour beforehand, and about the cellar, too? How could
you tell that you would fall down the cellar stairs in a fit, if
you didn't sham a fit on purpose?"

"I had to go to the cellar anyway, several times a day, indeed,"
Smerdyakov drawled deliberately. "I fell from the garret just in
the same way a year ago. It's quite true you can't tell the day and
hour of a fit beforehand, but you can always have a presentiment of
it."

"But you did foretell the day and the hour!"

"In regard to my epilepsy, sir, you had much better inquire of
the doctors here. You can ask them whether it was a real fit or a
sham; it's no use my saying any more about it."

"And the cellar? How could you know beforehand of the
cellar?"

"You don't seem able to get over that cellar! As I was going
down to the cellar, I was in terrible dread and doubt. What
frightened me most was losing you and being left without defence in
all the world. So I went down into the cellar thinking, 'Here,
it'll come on directly, it'll strike me down directly, shall I
fall?' And it was through this fear that I suddenly felt the spasm
that always comesâ€¦ and so I went flying. All that and all my
previous conversation with you at the gate the evening before, when
I told you how frightened I was and spoke of the cellar, I told all
that to Doctor Herzenstube and Nikolay Parfenovitch, the
investigating lawyer, and it's all been written down in the
protocol. And the doctor here, Mr. Varvinsky, maintained to all of
them that it was just the thought of it brought it on, the
apprehension that I might fall. It was just then that the fit
seized me. And so they've written it down, that it's just how it
must have happened, simply from my fear."

As he finished, Smerdyakov. drew a deep breath, as though
exhausted.

"Then you have said all that in your evidence?" said Ivan,
somewhat taken aback. He had meant to frighten him with the threat
of repeating their conversation, and it appeared that Smerdyakov
had already reported it all himself.
