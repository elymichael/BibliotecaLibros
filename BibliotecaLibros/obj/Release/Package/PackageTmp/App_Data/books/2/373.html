"Couldn't you, without abandoning your resolution to be silent<br/>about the chief point, could you not, at the same time, give us<br/>some slight hint as to the nature of the motives which are strong<br/>enough to induce you to refuse to answer, at a crisis so full of<br/>danger to you?"<br/><br/>Mitya smiled mournfully, almost dreamily.<br/><br/>"I'm much more good-natured than you think, gentlemen. I'll tell<br/>you the reason why and give you that hint, though you don't deserve<br/>it. I won't speak of that, gentlemen, because it would be a stain<br/>on my honour. The answer to the question where I got the money<br/>would expose me to far greater disgrace than the murder and robbing<br/>of my father, if I had murdered and robbed him. That's why I can't<br/>tell you. I can't for fear of disgrace. What, gentlemen, are you<br/>going to write that down?"<br/><br/>"Yes, we'll write it down," lisped Nikolay Parfenovitch.<br/><br/>"You ought not to write that down about 'disgrace.' I only told<br/>you that in the goodness of my heart. I needn't have told you. I<br/>made you a present of it, so to speak, and you pounce upon it at<br/>once. Oh, well, write- write what you like," he concluded, with<br/>scornful disgust. "I'm not afraid of you and I can still hold up my<br/>head before you."<br/><br/>"And can't you tell us the nature of that disgrace?" Nikolay<br/>Parfenovitch hazarded.<br/><br/>The prosecutor frowned darkly.<br/><br/>"No, no, c'est fini, don't trouble yourselves. It's not worth<br/>while soiling one's hands. I have soiled myself enough through you<br/>as it is. You're not worth it- no one is. Enough, gentlemen. I'm<br/>not going on."<br/><br/>This was said too peremptorily. Nikolay Parfenovitch did not<br/>insist further, but from Ippolit Kirillovitch's eyes he saw that he<br/>had not given up hope.<br/><br/>"Can you not, at least, tell us what sum you had in your hands<br/>when you went into Mr. Perhotin's- how many roubles exactly?"<br/><br/>"I can't tell you that."<br/>
