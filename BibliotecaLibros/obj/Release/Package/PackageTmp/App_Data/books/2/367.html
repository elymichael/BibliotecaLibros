"He is suspected, too."<br/><br/>Mitya fixed his eyes on the floor.<br/><br/>"Joking apart," he brought out gloomily. "Listen. From the very<br/>beginning, almost from the moment when I ran out to you from behind<br/>the curtain, I've had the thought of Smerdyakov in my mind. I've<br/>been sitting here, shouting that I'm innocent and thinking all the<br/>time 'Smerdyakov!' I can't get Smerdyakov out of my head. In fact,<br/>I, too, thought of Smerdyakov just now; but only for a second.<br/>Almost at once I thought, 'No, it's not Smerdyakov.' It's not his<br/>doing, gentlemen."<br/><br/>"In that case is there anybody else you suspect?" Nikolay<br/>Parfenovitch inquired cautiously.<br/><br/>"I don't know anyone it could be, whether it's the hand of<br/>Heaven or of Satan, butâ€¦ not Smerdyakov," Mitya jerked out with<br/>decision.<br/><br/>"But what makes you affirm so confidently and emphatically that<br/>it's not he?"<br/><br/>"From my conviction- my impression. Because Smerdyakov is a man<br/>of the most abject character and a coward. He's not a coward, he's<br/>the epitome of all the cowardice in the world walking on two legs.<br/>He has the heart of a chicken. When he talked to me, he was always<br/>trembling for fear I should kill him, though I never raised my hand<br/>against him. He fell at my feet and blubbered; he has kissed these<br/>very boots, literally, beseeching me 'not to frighten him.' Do you<br/>hear? 'Not to frighten him.' What a thing to say! Why, I offered<br/>him money. He's a puling chicken- sickly, epileptic, weak-minded- a<br/>child of eight could thrash him. He has no character worth talking<br/>about. It's not Smerdyakov, gentlemen. He doesn't care for money;<br/>he wouldn't take my presents. Besides, what motive had he for<br/>murdering the old man? Why, he's very likely his son, you know- his<br/>natural son. Do you know that?"<br/><br/>"We have heard that legend. But you are your father's son, too,<br/>you know; yet you yourself told everyone you meant to murder<br/>him."<br/><br/>"That's a thrust! And a nasty, mean one, too! I'm not afraid!<br/>Oh, gentlemen, isn't it too base of you to say that to my face?<br/>It's base, because I told you that myself. I not only wanted to<br/>murder him, but I might have done it. And, what's more, I went out<br/>of my way to tell you of my own accord that I nearly murdered him.<br/>But, you see, I didn't murder him; you see, my guardian angel saved<br/>me- that's what you've not taken into account. And that's why it's<br/>so base of you. For I didn't kill him, I didn't kill him! Do you<br/>hear, I did not kill him."<br/><br/>He was almost choking. He had not been so moved before during<br/>the whole interrogation.<br/><br/>"And what has he told you, gentlemen- Smerdyakov, I mean?" he<br/>added suddenly, after a pause. "May I ask that question?"<br/>
