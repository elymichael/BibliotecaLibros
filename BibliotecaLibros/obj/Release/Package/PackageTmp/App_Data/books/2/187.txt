Ivan shook. "Get away, miserable idiot. What have I to do with
you?" was on the tip of his tongue, but to his profound
astonishment he heard himself say, "Is my father still asleep, or
has he waked?"

He asked the question softly and meekly, to his own surprise,
and at once, again to his own surprise, sat down on the bench. For
an instant he felt almost frightened; he remembered it afterwards.
Smerdyakov stood facing him, his hands behind his back, looking at
him with assurance and almost severity.

"His honour is still asleep," he articulated deliberately ("You
were the first to speak, not I," he seemed to say). "I am surprised
at you, sir," he added, after a pause, dropping his eyes
affectedly, setting his right foot forward, and playing with the
tip of his polished boot.

"Why are you surprised at me?" Ivan asked abruptly and sullenly,
doing his utmost to restrain himself, and suddenly realising, with
disgust, that he was feeling intense curiosity and would not, on
any account, have gone away without satisfying it.

"Why don't you go to Tchermashnya, sir?" Smerdyakov suddenly
raised his eyes and smiled familiarly. "Why I smile you must
understand of yourself, if you are a clever man," his screwed-up
left eye seemed to say.

"Why should I go to Tchermashnya?" Ivan asked in surprise.

Smerdyakov was silent again.

"Fyodor Pavlovitch himself has so begged you to," he said at
last, slowly and apparently attaching no significance to his
answer. "I put you off with a secondary reason," he seemed to
suggest, "simply to say something."

"Damn you! Speak out what you want!" Ivan cried angrily at last,
passing from meekness to violence.

Smerdyakov drew his right foot up to his left, pulled himself
up, but still looked at him with the same serenity and the same
little smile.
