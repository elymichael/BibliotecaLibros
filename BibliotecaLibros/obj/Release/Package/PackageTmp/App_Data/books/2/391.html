<br/>"Yes, what you said just now," said Nikolay Parfenovitch,<br/>looking at him surprise, "that is, that up to the last hour you<br/>were still contemplating going to Katerina Ivanovna to beg that sum<br/>from her… . I assure you, that's a very important piece of evidence<br/>for us, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, I mean for the whole case… and<br/>particularly for you, particularly important for you."<br/><br/>"Have mercy, gentlemen!" Mitya flung up his hands. "Don't write<br/>that, anyway; have some shame. Here I've torn my heart asunder<br/>before you, and you seize the opportunity and are fingering the<br/>wounds in both halves… . Oh, my God!"<br/><br/>In despair he hid his face in his hands.<br/><br/>"Don't worry yourself so, Dmitri Fyodorovitch," observed the<br/>prosecutor, "everything that is written down will be read over to<br/>you afterwards, and what you don't agree to we'll alter as you<br/>like.

And now, too, when you<br/>got hold of the money you had yesterday, you gave many people to<br/>understand that you had brought three thousand with you."<br/><br/>"You've got not dozens, but hundreds of witnesses, two hundred<br/>witnesses, two hundred have heard it, thousands have heard it!"<br/>cried Mitya.<br/><br/>"Well, you see, all bear witness to it. And the word all means<br/>something."<br/><br/>"It means nothing. I talked rot, and everyone began repeating<br/>it."<br/><br/>"But what need had you to 'talk rot,' as you call it?"<br/><br/>
