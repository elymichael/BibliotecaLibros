<br/>"It's incomprehensible."<br/><br/>"I wonder at you. But I'll make it clearer. Perhaps it really is<br/>incomprehensible. You see, attend to what I say. I appropriate<br/>three thousand entrusted to my honour; I spend it on a spree, say I<br/>spend it all, and next morning I go to her and say, 'Katya, I've<br/>done wrong, I've squandered your three thousand'; well, is that<br/>right? No, it's not right- it's dishonest and cowardly; I'm a<br/>beast, with no more self-control than a beast, that's so, isn't it?<br/>But still I'm not a thief? Not a downright thief, you'll admit! I<br/>squandered it, but I didn't steal it. Now a second, rather more<br/>favourable alternative: follow me carefully, or I may get confused<br/>again- my head's going round- and so, for the second alternative: I<br/>spend here only fifteen hundred out of the three thousand, that is,<br/>only half. Next day I go and take that half to her: 'Katya, take<br/>this fifteen hundred from me, I'm a low beast, and an untrustworthy<br/>scoundrel, for I've wasted half the money, and I shall waste this,<br/>too, so keep me from temptation!' Well, what of that alternative? I<br/>should be a beast and a scoundrel, and whatever you like; but not a<br/>thief, not altogether a thief, or I should not have brought back<br/>what was left, but have kept that, too. She would see at once that<br/>since I brought back half, I should pay back what I'd spent, that I<br/>should never give up trying to, that I should work to get it and<br/>pay it back. So in that case I should be a scoundrel, but not a<br/>thief, you may say what you like, not a thief!"<br/><br/>"I admit that there is a certain distinction," said the<br/>prosecutor, with a cold smile. "But it's strange that you see such<br/>a vital difference."<br/><br/>"Yes, I see a vital difference. Every man may be a scoundrel,<br/>and perhaps every man is a scoundrel, but not everyone can be a<br/>thief; it takes an arch-scoundrel to be that. Oh, of course, I<br/>don't know how to make these fine distinctionsâ€¦ but a thief is<br/>lower than a scoundrel, that's my conviction. Listen, I carry the<br/>money about me a whole month; I may make up my mind to give it back<br/>to-morrow, and I'm a scoundrel no longer; but I cannot make up my<br/>mind, you see, though I'm making up my mind every day, and every<br/>day spurring myself on to do it, and yet for a whole month I can't<br/>bring myself to it, you see. Is that right to your thinking, is<br/>that right?"<br/><br/>"Certainly, that's not right; that I can quite understand, and<br/>that I don't dispute," answered the prosecutor with reserve. "And<br/>let us give up all discussion of these subtleties and distinctions,<br/>and, if you will be so kind, get back to the point. And the point<br/>is, that you have still not told us, although we've asked you, why,<br/>in the first place, you halved the money, squandering one half and<br/>hiding the other? For what purpose exactly did you hide it, what<br/>did you mean to do with that fifteen hundred? I insist upon that<br/>question, Dmitri Fyodorovitch."<br/><br/>"Yes, of course!" cried Mitya, striking himself on the forehead;<br/>"forgive me, I'm worrying you, and am not explaining the chief<br/>point, or you'd understand in a minute, for it's just the motive of<br/>it that's the disgrace! You see, it was all to do with the old man,<br/>my dead father. He was always pestering Agrafena and I was jealous;<br/>I thought then that she was hesitating between me and him. So I<br/>kept thinking everyday, suppose she were to make up her mind all of<br/>a sudden, suppose she were to leave off tormenting me, and were<br/>suddenly to say to me, 'I love you, not him; take me to the other<br/>end of the world.' And I'd only forty copecks; how could I take her<br/>away, what could I do? Why, I'd be lost. You see, I didn't know her<br/>then, I didn't understand her, I thought she wanted money, and that<br/>she wouldn't forgive my poverty. And so I fiendishly counted out<br/>the half of that three thousand, sewed it up, calculating on it,<br/>sewed it up before I was drunk, and after I had sewn it up, I went<br/>off to get drunk on the rest. Yes, that was base. Do you understand<br/>now?"<br/><br/>Both the lawyers laughed aloud.<br/><br/>"I should have called it sensible and moral on your part not to<br/>have squandered it all," chuckled Nikolay Parfenovitch, "for after<br/>all what does it amount to?"<br/><br/>"Why, that I stole it, that's what it amounts to! Oh, God, you<br/>horrify me by not understanding! Every day that I had that fifteen<br/>hundred sewn up round my neck, every day and every hour I said to<br/>myself, 'You're a thief! you're a thief!' Yes, that's why I've been<br/>so savage all this month, that's why I fought in the tavern, that's<br/>why I attacked my father, it was because I felt I was a thief. I<br/>couldn't make up my mind; I didn't dare even to tell Alyosha, my<br/>brother, about that fifteen hundred: I felt I was such a scoundrel<br/>and such a pickpocket. But, do you know, while I carried it I said<br/>to myself at the same time every hour: 'No, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,<br/>you may yet not be a thief.' Why? Because I might go next day and<br/>pay back that fifteen hundred to Katya. And only yesterday I made<br/>up my mind to tear my amulet off my neck, on my way from Fenya's to<br/>Perhotin. I hadn't been able till that moment to bring myself to<br/>it. And it was only when I tore it off that I became a downright<br/>thief, a thief and a dishonest man for the rest of my life. Why?<br/>Because, with that I destroyed, too, my dream of going to Katya and<br/>saying, 'I'm a scoundrel, but not a thief! Do you understand now?<br/>Do you understand?"<br/><br/>"What was it made you decide to do it yesterday?" Nikolay<br/>Parfenovitch interrupted.<br/><br/>
