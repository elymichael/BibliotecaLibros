<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>4<br/>The Confession of a Passionate Heart- In Anecdote<br/><br/><br/>"I was leading a wild life then. Father said just now that I<br/>spent several thousand roubles in seducing young girls. That's a<br/>swinish invention, and there was nothing of the sort. And if there<br/>was, I didn't need money simply for that. With me money is an<br/>accessory, the overflow of my heart, the framework. To-day she<br/>would be my lady, to-morrow a wench out of the streets in her<br/>place. I entertained them both. I threw away money by the handful<br/>on music, rioting, and Gypsies. Sometimes I gave it to the ladies,<br/>too, for they'll take it greedily, that must be admitted, and be<br/>pleased and thankful for it. Ladies used to be fond of me: not all<br/>of them, but it happened, it happened. But I always liked<br/>side-paths, little dark back-alleys behind the main road- there one<br/>finds adventures and surprises, and precious metal in the dirt. I<br/>am speaking figuratively, brother. In the town I was in, there were<br/>no such back-alleys in the literal sense, but morally there were.<br/>If you were like me, you'd know what that means. I loved vice, I<br/>loved the ignominy of vice. I loved cruelty; am I not a bug, am I<br/>not a noxious insect? In fact a Karamazov! Once we went, a whole<br/>lot of us, for a picnic, in seven sledges. It was dark, it was<br/>winter, and I began squeezing a girl's hand, and forced her to kiss<br/>me. She was the daughter of an official, a sweet, gentle,<br/>submissive creature. She allowed me, she allowed me much in the<br/>dark. She thought, poor thing, that I should come next day to make<br/>her an offer (I was looked upon as a good match, too). But I didn't<br/>say a word to her for five months. I used to see her in a corner at<br/>dances (we were always having dances), her eyes watching me. I saw<br/>how they glowed with fire- a fire of gentle indignation. This game<br/>only tickled that insect lust I cherished in my soul. Five months<br/>later she married an official and left the town, still angry, and<br/>still, perhaps, in love with me. Now they live happily. Observe<br/>that I told no one. I didn't boast of it. Though I'm full of low<br/>desires, and love what's low, I'm not dishonourable. You're<br/>blushing; your eyes flashed. Enough of this filth with you. And all<br/>this was nothing much- wayside blossoms a la Paul de Kock- though<br/>the cruel insect had already grown strong in my soul. I've a<br/>perfect album of reminiscences, brother. God bless them, the<br/>darlings. I tried to break it off without quarrelling. And I never<br/>gave them away, I never bragged of one of them. But that's enough.<br/>You can't suppose I brought you here simply to talk of such<br/>nonsense. No, I'm going to tell you something more curious; and<br/>don't be surprised that I'm glad to tell you, instead of being<br/>ashamed."<br/><br/>"You say that because I blushed," Alyosha said suddenly. "I<br/>wasn't blushing at what you were saying or at what you've done. I<br/>blushed because I am the same as you are."<br/><br/>"You? Come, that's going a little too far!"<br/><br/>"No, it's not too far," said Alyosha warmly (obviously the idea<br/>was not a new one). "The ladder's the same. I'm at the bottom step,<br/>and you're above, somewhere about the thirteenth. That's how I see<br/>it. But it's all the same. Absolutely the same in kind. Anyone on<br/>the bottom step is bound to go up to the top one."<br/><br/>"Then one ought not to step on at all."<br/><br/>"Anyone who can help it had better not."<br/><br/>"But can you?"<br/>
