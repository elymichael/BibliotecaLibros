<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>1<br/>â€”<br/>At Grushenka's<br/><br/><br/>ALYOSHA went towards the cathedral square to the widow Morozov's<br/>house to see Grushenka, who had sent Fenya to him early in the<br/>morning with an urgent message begging him to come. Questioning<br/>Fenya, Alyosha learned that her mistress had been particularly<br/>distressed since the previous day. During the two months that had<br/>passed since Mitya's arrest, Alyosha had called frequently at the<br/>widow Morozov's house, both from his own inclination and to take<br/>messages for Mitya. Three days after Mitya's arrest, Grushenka was<br/>taken very ill and was ill for nearly five weeks. For one whole<br/>week she was unconscious. She was very much changed- thinner and a<br/>little sallow, though she had for the past fortnight been well<br/>enough to go out. But to Alyosha her face was even more attractive<br/>than before, and he liked to meet her eyes when he went in to her.<br/>A look of firmness and intelligent purpose had developed in her<br/>face. There were signs of a spiritual transformation in her, and a<br/>steadfast, fine and humble determination that nothing could shake<br/>could be discerned in her. There was a small vertical line between<br/>her brows which gave her charming face a look of concentrated<br/>thought, almost austere at the first glance. There was scarcely a<br/>trace of her former frivolity.<br/><br/>It seemed strange to Alyosha, too, that in spite of the calamity<br/>that had overtaken the poor girl, betrothed to a man who had been<br/>arrested for a terrible crime, almost at the instant of their<br/>betrothal, in spite of her illness and the almost inevitable<br/>sentence hanging over Mitya, Grushenka had not yet lost her<br/>youthful cheerfulness. There was a soft light in the once proud<br/>eyes, though at times they gleamed with the old vindictive fire<br/>when she was visited by one disturbing thought stronger than ever<br/>in her heart. The object of that uneasiness was the same as ever-<br/>Katerina Ivanovna, of whom Grushenka had even raved when she lay in<br/>delirium. Alyosha knew that she was fearfully jealous of her. Yet<br/>Katerina Ivanovna had not once visited Mitya in his prison, though<br/>she might have done it whenever she liked. All this made a<br/>difficult problem for Alyosha, for he was the only person to whom<br/>Grushenka opened her heart and from whom she was continually asking<br/>advice. Sometimes he was unable to say anything.<br/><br/>Full of anxiety he entered her lodging. She was at home. She had<br/>returned from seeing Mitya half an hour before, and from the rapid<br/>movement with which she leapt up from her chair to meet him he saw<br/>that she had been expecting him with great impatience. A pack of<br/>cards dealt for a game of "fools" lay on the table. A bed had been<br/>made up on the leather sofa on the other side and Maximov lay, half<br/>reclining, on it. He wore a dressing-gown and a cotton nightcap,<br/>and was evidently ill and weak, though he was smiling blissfully.<br/>When the homeless old man returned with Grushenka from Mokroe two<br/>months before, he had simply stayed on and was still staying with<br/>her. He arrived with her in rain and sleet, sat down on the sofa,<br/>drenched and scared, and gazed mutely at her with a timid,<br/>appealing smile. Grushenka, who was in terrible grief and in the<br/>first stage of fever, almost forgot his existence in all she had to<br/>do the first half hour after her arrival. Suddenly she chanced to<br/>look at him intently: he laughed a pitiful, helpless little laugh.<br/>She called Fenya and told her to give him something to eat. All<br/>that day he sat in the same place, almost without stirring. When it<br/>got dark and the shutters were closed, Fenya asked her<br/>mistress:<br/><br/>"Is the gentleman going to stay the night, mistress?"<br/><br/>"Yes; make him a bed on the sofa," answered Grushenka.<br/><br/>Questioning him more in detail, Grushenka learned from him that<br/>he had literally nowhere to go, and that "Mr. Kalganov, my<br/>benefactor, told me straight that he wouldn't receive me again and<br/>gave me five roubles."<br/><br/>"Well, God bless you, you'd better stay, then," Grushenka<br/>decided in her grief, smiling compassionately at him. Her smile<br/>wrung the old man's heart and his lips twitched with grateful<br/>tears. And so the destitute wanderer had stayed with her ever<br/>since. He did not leave the house even when she was ill. Fenya and<br/>her grandmother, the cook, did not turn him out, but went on<br/>serving him meals and making up his bed on the sofa. Grushenka had<br/>grown used to him, and coming back from seeing Mitya (whom she had<br/>begun to visit in prison before she was really well) she would sit<br/>down and begin talking to "Maximushka" about trifling matters, to<br/>keep her from thinking of her sorrow. The old man turned out to be<br/>a good story-teller on occasions, so that at last he became<br/>necessary to her. Grushenka saw scarcely anyone else beside<br/>Alyosha, who did not come every day and never stayed long. Her old<br/>merchant lay seriously ill at this time, "at his last gasp" as they<br/>said in the town, and he did, in fact, die a week after Mitya's<br/>trial. Three weeks before his death, feeling the end approaching,<br/>he made his sons, their wives and children, come upstairs to him at<br/>last and bade them not leave him again. From that moment he gave<br/>strict orders to his servants not to admit Grushenka and to tell<br/>her if she came, "The master wishes you long life and happiness and<br/>tells you to forget him." But Grushenka sent almost every day to<br/>inquire after him.<br/>
