Mitya stood for a moment, then mechanically sank on to a chair
next to Fenya. He sat, not reflecting but, as it were,
terror-stricken, benumbed. Yet everything was clear as day: that
officer, he knew about him, he knew everything perfectly, he had
known it from Grushenka herself, had known that a letter had come
from him a month before. So that for a month, for a whole month,
this had been going on, a secret from him, till the very arrival of
this new man, and he had never thought of him! But how could he,
how could he not have thought of him? Why was it he had forgotten
this officer, like that, forgotten him as soon as he heard of him?
That was the question that faced him like some monstrous thing. And
he looked at this monstrous thing with horror, growing cold with
horror.

But suddenly, as gently and mildly as a gentle and affectionate
child, he began speaking to Fenya as though he had utterly
forgotten how he had scared and hurt her just now. He fell to
questioning Fenya with an extreme preciseness, astonishing in his
position, and though the girl looked wildly at his blood-stained
hands, she, too, with wonderful readiness and rapidity, answered
every question as though eager to put the whole truth and nothing
but the truth before him. Little by little, even with a sort of
enjoyment, she began explaining every detail, not wanting to
torment him, but, as it were, eager to be of the utmost service to
him. She described the whole of that day, in great detail, the
visit of Rakitin and Alyosha, how she, Fenya, had stood on the
watch, how the mistress had set off, and how she had called out of
the window to Alyosha to give him, Mitya, her greetings, and to
tell him "to remember for ever how she had loved him for an
hour."

Hearing of the message, Mitya suddenly smiled, and there was a
flush of colour on his pale cheeks. At the same moment Fenya said
to him, not a bit afraid now to be inquisitive:

"Look at your hands, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. They're all over
blood!

"Yes," answered Mitya mechanically. He looked carelessly at his
hands and at once forgot them and Fenya's question.

He sank into silence again. Twenty minutes had passed since he
had run in. His first horror was over, but evidently some new fixed
determination had taken possession of him. He suddenly stood up,
smiling dreamily.

"What has happened to you, sir?" said Fenya, pointing to his
hands again. She spoke compassionately, as though she felt very
near to him now in his grief. Mitya looked at his hands again.

"That's blood, Fenya," he said, looking at her with a strange
expression. "That's human blood, and my God! why was it shed? But…
Fenya… there's a fence here" (he looked at her as though setting
her a riddle), "a high fence, and terrible to look at. But at dawn
to-morrow, when the sun rises, Mitya will leap over that fence… .
You don't understand what fence, Fenya, and, never mind… . You'll
hear to-morrow and understand… and now, good-bye. I won't stand in
her way. I'll step aside, I know how to step aside. Live, my joy… .
You loved me for an hour, remember Mityenka Karamazov so for ever…
. She always used to call me Mityenka, do you remember?"

And with those words he went suddenly out of the kitchen. Fenya
was almost more frightened at this sudden departure than she had
been when he ran in and attacked her.

Just ten minutes later Dmitri went in to Pyotr Ilyitch Perhotin,
the young official with whom he had pawned his pistols. It was by
now half-past eight, and Pyotr Ilyitch had finished his evening
tea, and had just put his coat on again to go to the Metropolis to
play billiards. Mitya caught him coming out.
