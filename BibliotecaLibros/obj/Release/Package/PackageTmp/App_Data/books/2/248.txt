Grushenka leapt up from her place.

"Surely you don't want to go, Alyosha!" she cried, in mournful
surprise. "What are you doing to me? You've stirred up my feeling,
tortured me, and now you'll leave me to face this night alone!"

"He can hardly spend the night with you! Though if he wants to,
let him! I'll go alone," Rakitin scoffed jeeringly.

"Hush, evil tongue!" Grushenka cried angrily at him; "you never
said such words to me as he has come to say."

"What has he said to you so special?" asked Rakitin
irritably.

"I can't say, I don't know. I don't know what he said to me, it
went straight to my heart; he has wrung my heart… . He is the
first, the only one who has pitied me, that's what it is. Why did
you not come before, you angel?" She fell on her knees before him
as though in a sudden frenzy. "I've been waiting all my life for
someone like you, I knew that someone like you would come and
forgive me. I believed that, nasty as I am, someone would really
love me, not only with a shameful love!"

"What have I done to you?" answered Alyosha, bending over her
with a tender smile, and gently taking her by the hands; "I only
gave you an onion, nothing but a tiny little onion, that was
all!"

He was moved to tears himself as he said it. At that moment
there was a sudden noise in the passage, someone came into the
hall. Grushenka jumped up, seeming greatly alarmed. Fenya ran
noisily into the room, crying out:

"Mistress, mistress darling, a messenger has galloped up," she
cried, breathless and joyful. "A carriage from Mokroe for you,
Timofey the driver, with three horses, they are just putting in
fresh horses… . A letter, here's the letter, mistress."

A letter was in her hand and she waved it in the air all the
while she talked. Grushenka snatched the letter from her and
carried it to the candle. It was only a note, a few lines. She read
it in one instant.
