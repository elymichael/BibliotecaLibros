<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>5<br/>Elders<br/><br/><br/>SOME of my readers may imagine that my young man was a sickly,<br/>ecstatic, poorly developed creature, a pale, consumptive dreamer.<br/>On the contrary, Alyosha was at this time a well-grown,<br/>red-cheeked, clear-eyed lad of nineteen, radiant with health. He<br/>was very handsome, too, graceful, moderately tall, with hair of a<br/>dark brown, with a regular, rather long, oval-shaped face, and<br/>wide-set dark grey, shining eyes; he was very thoughtful, and<br/>apparently very serene. I shall be told, perhaps, that red cheeks<br/>are not incompatible with fanaticism and mysticism; but I fancy<br/>that Alyosha was more of a realist than anyone. Oh! no doubt, in<br/>the monastery he fully believed in miracles, but, to my thinking,<br/>miracles are never a stumbling-block to the realist. It is not<br/>miracles that dispose realists to belief. The genuine realist, if<br/>he is an unbeliever, will always find strength and ability to<br/>disbelieve in the miraculous, and if he is confronted with a<br/>miracle as an irrefutable fact he would rather disbelieve his own<br/>senses than admit the fact. Even if he admits it, he admits it as a<br/>fact of nature till then unrecognised by him. Faith does not, in<br/>the realist, spring from the miracle but the miracle from faith. If<br/>the realist once believes, then he is bound by his very realism to<br/>admit the miraculous also. The Apostle Thomas said that he would<br/>not believe till he saw, but when he did see he said, "My Lord and<br/>my God!" Was it the miracle forced him to believe? Most likely not,<br/>but he believed solely because he desired to believe and possibly<br/>he fully believed in his secret heart even when he said, "I do not<br/>believe till I see."<br/><br/>I shall be told, perhaps, that Alyosha was stupid, undeveloped,<br/>had not finished his studies, and so on. That he did not finish his<br/>studies is true, but to say that he was stupid or dull would be a<br/>great injustice. I'll simply repeat what I have said above. He<br/>entered upon this path only because, at that time, it alone struck<br/>his imagination and presented itself to him as offering an ideal<br/>means of escape for his soul from darkness to light. Add to that<br/>that he was to some extent a youth of our last epoch- that is,<br/>honest in nature, desiring the truth, seeking for it and believing<br/>in it, and seeking to serve it at once with all the strength of his<br/>soul, seeking for immediate action, and ready to sacrifice<br/>everything, life itself, for it. Though these young men unhappily<br/>fail to understand that the sacrifice of life is, in many cases,<br/>the easiest of all sacrifices, and that to sacrifice, for instance,<br/>five or six years of their seething youth to hard and tedious<br/>study, if only to multiply tenfold their powers of serving the<br/>truth and the cause they have set before them as their goal such a<br/>sacrifice is utterly beyond the strength of many of them. The path<br/>Alyosha chose was a path going in the opposite direction, but he<br/>chose it with the same thirst for swift achievement. As soon as he<br/>reflected seriously he was convinced of the existence of God and<br/>immortality, and at once he instinctively said to himself: "I want<br/>to live for immortality, and I will accept no compromise." In the<br/>same way, if he had decided that God and immortality did not exist,<br/>he would at once have become an atheist and a socialist. For<br/>socialism is not merely the labour question, it is before all<br/>things the atheistic question, the question of the form taken by<br/>atheism to-day, the question of the tower of Babel built without<br/>God, not to mount to heaven from earth but to set up heaven on<br/>earth. Alyosha would have found it strange and impossible to go on<br/>living as before. It is written: "Give all that thou hast to the<br/>poor and follow Me, if thou wouldst be perfect."<br/><br/>Alyosha said to himself: "I can't give two roubles instead of<br/>'all,' and only go to mass instead of 'following Him.'" Perhaps his<br/>memories of childhood brought back our monastery, to which his<br/>mother may have taken him to mass. Perhaps the slanting sunlight<br/>and the holy image to which his poor "crazy" mother had held him up<br/>still acted upon his imagination. Brooding on these things he may<br/>have come to us perhaps only to see whether here he could sacrifice<br/>all or only "two roubles," and in the monastery he met this elder.<br/>I must digress to explain what an "elder" is in Russian<br/>monasteries, and I am sorry that I do not feel very competent to do<br/>so. I will try, however, to give a superficial account of it in a<br/>few words. Authorities on the subject assert that the institution<br/>of "elders" is of recent date, not more than a hundred years old in<br/>our monasteries, though in the orthodox East, especially in Sinai<br/>and Athos, it has existed over a thousand years. It is maintained<br/>that it existed in ancient times in Russia also, but through the<br/>calamities which overtook Russia- the Tartars, civil war, the<br/>interruption of relations with the East after the destruction of<br/>Constantinople- this institution fell into oblivion. It was revived<br/>among us towards the end of last century by one of the great<br/>"ascetics," as they called him, Paissy Velitchkovsky, and his<br/>disciples. But to this day it exists in few monasteries only, and<br/>has sometimes been almost persecuted as an innovation in Russia. It<br/>flourished especially in the celebrated Kozelski Optin Monastery.<br/>When and how it was introduced into our monastery I cannot say.<br/>There had already been three such elders and Zossima was the last<br/>of them. But he was almost dying of weakness and disease, and they<br/>had no one to take his place. The question for our monastery was an<br/>important one, for it had not been distinguished by anything in<br/>particular till then: they had neither relics of saints, nor<br/>wonder- working ikons, nor glorious traditions, nor historical<br/>exploits. It had flourished and been glorious all over Russia<br/>through its elders, to see and hear whom pilgrims had flocked for<br/>thousands of miles from all parts.<br/><br/>What was such an elder? An elder was one who took your soul,<br/>your will, into his soul and his will. When you choose an elder,<br/>you renounce your own will and yield it to him in complete<br/>submission, complete self-abnegation. This novitiate, this terrible<br/>school of abnegation, is undertaken voluntarily, in the hope of<br/>self-conquest, of self-mastery, in order, after a life of<br/>obedience, to attain perfect freedom, that is, from self; to escape<br/>the lot of those who have lived their whole life without finding<br/>their true selves in themselves. This institution of elders is not<br/>founded on theory, but was established in the East from the<br/>practice of a thousand years. The obligations due to an elder are<br/>not the ordinary "obedience" which has always existed in our<br/>Russian monasteries. The obligation involves confession to the<br/>elder by all who have submitted themselves to him, and to the<br/>indissoluble bond between him and them.<br/><br/>The story is told, for instance, that in the early days of<br/>Christianity one such novice, failing to fulfil some command laid<br/>upon him by his elder, left his monastery in Syria and went to<br/>Egypt. There, after great exploits, he was found worthy at last to<br/>suffer torture and a martyr's death for the faith. When the Church,<br/>regarding him as a saint, was burying him, suddenly, at the<br/>deacon's exhortation, "Depart all ye unbaptised," the coffin<br/>containing the martyr's body left its place and was cast forth from<br/>the church, and this took place three times. And only at last they<br/>learnt that this holy man had broken his vow of obedience and left<br/>his elder, and, therefore, could not be forgiven without the<br/>elder's absolution in spite of his great deeds. Only after this<br/>could the funeral take place. This, of course, is only an old<br/>legend. But here is a recent instance.<br/><br/>A monk was suddenly commanded by his elder to quit Athos, which<br/>he loved as a sacred place and a haven of refuge, and to go first<br/>to Jerusalem to do homage to the Holy Places and then to go to the<br/>north to Siberia: "There is the place for thee and not here." The<br/>monk, overwhelmed with sorrow, went to the Oecumenical Patriarch at<br/>Constantinople and besought him to release him from his obedience.<br/>But the Patriarch replied that not only was he unable to release<br/>him, but there was not and could not be on earth a power which<br/>could release him except the elder who had himself laid that duty<br/>upon him. In this way the elders are endowed in certain cases with<br/>unbounded and inexplicable authority. That is why in many of our<br/>monasteries the institution was at first resisted almost to<br/>persecution. Meantime the elders immediately began to be highly<br/>esteemed among the people. Masses of the ignorant people as well as<br/>of distinction flocked, for instance, to the elders of our<br/>monastery to confess their doubts, their sins, and their<br/>sufferings, and ask for counsel and admonition. Seeing this, the<br/>opponents of the elders declared that the sacrament of confession<br/>was being arbitrarily and frivolously degraded, though the<br/>continual opening of the heart to the elder by the monk or the<br/>layman had nothing of the character of the sacrament. In the end,<br/>however, the institution of elders has been retained and is<br/>becoming established in Russian monasteries. It is true, perhaps,<br/>that this instrument which had stood the test of a thousand years<br/>for the moral regeneration of a man from slavery to freedom and to<br/>moral perfectibility may be a two-edged weapon and it may lead some<br/>not to humility and complete self-control but to the most Satanic<br/>pride, that is, to bondage and not to freedom.<br/><br/>The elder Zossima was sixty-five. He came of a family of<br/>landowners, had been in the army in early youth, and served in the<br/>Caucasus as an officer. He had, no doubt, impressed Alyosha by some<br/>peculiar quality of his soul. Alyosha lived in the cell of the<br/>elder, who was very fond of him and let him wait upon him. It must<br/>be noted that Alyosha was bound by no obligation and could go where<br/>he pleased and be absent for whole days. Though he wore the<br/>monastic dress it was voluntarily, not to be different from others.<br/>No doubt he liked to do so. Possibly his youthful imagination was<br/>deeply stirred by the power and fame of his elder. It was said that<br/>so many people had for years past come to confess their sins to<br/>Father Zossima and to entreat him for words of advice and healing,<br/>that he had acquired the keenest intuition and could tell from an<br/>unknown face what a new-comer wanted, and what was the suffering on<br/>his conscience. He sometimes astounded and almost alarmed his<br/>visitors by his knowledge of their secrets before they had spoken a<br/>word.<br/>
