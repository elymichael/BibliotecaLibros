"It is yours, Dmitri Fyodorovitch," Madame Hohlakov cut in at<br/>once. "The money is as good as in your pocket, not three thousand,<br/>but three million, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, in less than no time. I'll<br/>make you a present of the idea: you shall find gold mines, make<br/>millions, return and become a leading man, and wake us up and lead<br/>us to better things. Are we to leave it all to the Jews? You will<br/>found institutions and enterprises of all sorts. You will help the<br/>poor, and they will bless you. This is the age of railways, Dmitri<br/>Fyodorovitch. You'll become famous and indispensable to the<br/>Department of Finance, which is so badly off at present. The<br/>depreciation of the rouble keeps me awake at night, Dmitri<br/>Fyodorovitch; people don't know that side of me-"<br/><br/>"Madam, madam! Dmitri interrupted with an uneasy presentiment.<br/>"I shall indeed, perhaps, follow your advice, your wise advice,<br/>madam… . I shall perhaps set off… to the gold mines… . I'll come<br/>and see you again about it… many times, indeed… but now, that three<br/>thousand you so generously… oh, that would set me free, and if you<br/>could to-day… you see, I haven't a minute, a minute to lose<br/>to-day-"<br/><br/>"Enough, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, enough!" Madame Hohlakov<br/>interrupted emphatically. "The question is, will you go to the gold<br/>mines or not; have you quite made up your mind? Answer yes or<br/>no."<br/><br/>"I will go, madam, afterwards… . I'll go where you like… but<br/>now-"<br/><br/>"Wait!" cried Madame Hohlakov. And jumping up and running to a<br/>handsome bureau with numerous little drawers, she began pulling out<br/>one drawer after another, looking for something with desperate<br/>haste.<br/><br/>"The three thousand," thought Mitya, his heart almost stopping,<br/>"and at the instant… without any papers or formalities… that's<br/>doing things in gentlemanly style! She's a splendid woman, if only<br/>she didn't talk so much!"<br/><br/>"Here!" cried Madame Hohlakov, running back joyfully to Mitya,<br/>"here is what I was looking for!"<br/><br/>It was a tiny silver ikon on a cord, such as is sometimes worn<br/>next the skin with a cross.<br/><br/>"This is from Kiev, Dmitri Fyodorovitch," she went on<br/>reverently, "from the relics of the Holy Martyr, Varvara. Let me<br/>put it on your neck myself, and with it dedicate you to a new life,<br/>to a new career."<br/><br/>And she actually put the cord round his neck, and began<br/>arranging it. In extreme embarrassment, Mitya bent down and helped<br/>her, and at last he got it under his neck-tie and collar through<br/>his shirt to his chest.<br/><br/>"Now you can set off," Madame Hohlakov pronounced, sitting down<br/>triumphantly in her place again.<br/>
