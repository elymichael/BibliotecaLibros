I took the book again, opened it in another place and showed him
the Epistle to the Hebrews, chapter 10, verse 31. He read:

"It is a fearful thing to fall

into the hands of the living God."

He read it and simply flung down the book. He was trembling all
over.

"An awful text," he said. "There's no denying you've picked out
fitting ones." He rose from the chair. "Well!" he said, "good-bye,
perhaps I shan't come again… we shall meet in heaven. So I have
been for fourteen years 'in the hands of the living God,' that's
how one must think of those fourteen years. To-morrow I will
beseech those hands to let me go."

I wanted to take him in my arms and kiss him, but I did not
dare- his face was contorted add sombre. He went away.

"Good God," I thought, "what has he gone to face!" I fell on my
knees before the ikon and wept for him before the Holy Mother of
God, our swift defender and helper. I was half an hour praying in
tears, and it was late, about midnight. Suddenly I saw the door
open and he came in again. I was surprised.

Where have you been?" I asked him.

"I think," he said, "I've forgotten something… my handkerchief,
I think… . Well, even if I've not forgotten anything, let me stay a
little."

He sat down. I stood over him.
