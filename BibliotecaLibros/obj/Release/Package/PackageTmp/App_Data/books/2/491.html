"Alexey Fyodorovitch," he said, with a cold smile, "I can't<br/>endure prophets and epileptics- messengers from God especially- and<br/>you know that only too well. I break off all relations with you<br/>from this moment and probably for ever. I beg you to leave me at<br/>this turning. It's the way to your lodgings, too. You'd better be<br/>particularly careful not to come to me to-day! Do you hear?"<br/><br/>He turned and walked on with a firm step, not looking back.<br/><br/>"Brother," Alyosha called after him, "if anything happens to you<br/>to-day, turn to me before anyone!"<br/><br/>But Ivan made no reply. Alyosha stood under the lamp-post at the<br/>cross roads, till Ivan had vanished into the darkness. Then he<br/>turned and walked slowly homewards. Both Alyosha and Ivan were<br/>living in lodgings; neither of them was willing to live in Fyodor<br/>Pavlovitch's empty house. Alyosha had a furnished room in the house<br/>of some working people. Ivan lived some distance from him. He had<br/>taken a roomy and fairly comfortable lodge attached to a fine house<br/>that belonged to a well-to-do lady, the widow of an official. But<br/>his only attendant was a deaf and rheumatic old crone who went to<br/>bed at six o'clock every evening and got up at six in the morning.<br/>Ivan had become remarkably indifferent to his comforts of late, and<br/>very fond of being alone. He did everything for himself in the one<br/>room he lived in, and rarely entered any of the other rooms in his<br/>abode.<br/><br/>He reached the gate of the house and had his hand on the bell,<br/>when he suddenly stopped. He felt that he was trembling all over<br/>with anger. Suddenly he let go of the bell, turned back with a<br/>curse, and walked with rapid steps in the opposite direction. He<br/>walked a mile and a half to a tiny, slanting, wooden house, almost<br/>a hut, where Marya Kondratyevna, the neighbour who used to come to<br/>Fyodor Pavlovitch's kitchen for soup and to whom Smerdyakov had<br/>once sung his songs and played on the guitar, was now lodging. She<br/>had sold their little house, and was now living here with her<br/>mother. Smerdyakov, who was ill- almost dying-had been with them<br/>ever since Fyodor Pavlovitch's death. It was to him Ivan was going<br/>now, drawn by a sudden and irresistible prompting.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
