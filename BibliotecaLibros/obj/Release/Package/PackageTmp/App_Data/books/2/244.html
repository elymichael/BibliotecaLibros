<br/>Alyosha bent a long wondering look upon her and a light seemed<br/>to dawn in his face.<br/><br/>"Rakitin," he said suddenly, in a firm and loud voice; "don't<br/>taunt me with having rebelled against God. I don't want to feel<br/>angry with you, so you must be kinder, too; I've lost a treasure<br/>such as you have never had, and you cannot judge me now. You had<br/>much better look at her- do you see how she has pity on me? I came<br/>here to find a wicked soul- I felt drawn to evil because I was base<br/>and evil myself, and I've found a true sister; I have found a<br/>treasure- a loving heart. She had pity on me just nowâ€¦ . Agrafena<br/>Alexandrovna, I am speaking of you. You've raised my soul from the<br/>depths."<br/><br/>Alyosha's lips were quivering and he caught his breath.<br/><br/>"She has saved you, it seems," laughed Rakitin spitefully. "And<br/>she meant to get you in her clutches, do your realise that?"<br/><br/>"Stay, Rakitin." Grushenka jumped up. "Hush, both of you. Now<br/>I'll tell you all about it. Hush, Alyosha, your words make me<br/>ashamed, for I am bad and not good- that's what I am. And you hush,<br/>Rakitin, because you are telling lies. I had the low idea of trying<br/>to get him in my clutches, but now you are lying, now it's all<br/>different. And don't let me hear anything more from you,<br/>Rakitin."<br/><br/>All this Grushenka said with extreme emotion.<br/><br/>"They are both crazy," said Rakitin, looking at them with<br/>amazement. "I feel as though I were in a madhouse. They're both<br/>getting so feeble they'll begin crying in a minute."<br/><br/>"I shall begin to cry, I shall," repeated Grushenka. "He called<br/>me his sister and I shall never forget that. Only let me tell you,<br/>Rakitin, though I am bad, I did give away an onion."<br/><br/>"An onion? Hang it all, you really are crazy."<br/><br/>Rakitin wondered at their enthusiasm. He was aggrieved and<br/>annoyed, though he might have reflected that each of them was just<br/>passing through a spiritual crisis such as does not come often in a<br/>lifetime. But though Rakitin was very sensitive about everything<br/>that concerned himself, he was very obtuse as regards the feelings<br/>and sensations of others- partly from his youth and inexperience,<br/>partly from his intense egoism.<br/><br/>
