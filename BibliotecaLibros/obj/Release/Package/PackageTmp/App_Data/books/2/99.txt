"Shouldn't you put a wet bandage on your head and go to bed,
too?" Alyosha said to him. "We'll look after him. My brother gave
you a terrible blow- on the head."

"He's insulted me!" Grigory articulated gloomily and
distinctly.

"He's 'insulted' his father, not only you," observed Ivan with a
forced smile.

"I used to wash him in his tub. He's insulted me," repeated
Grigory.

"Damn it all, if I hadn't pulled him away perhaps he'd have
murdered him. It wouldn't take much to do for Aesop, would it?"
whispered Ivan to Alyosha.

"God forbid!" cried Alyosha.

"Why should He forbid?" Ivan went on in the same whisper, with a
malignant grimace. "One reptile will devour the other. And serve
them both right, too."

Alyosha shuddered.

"Of course I won't let him be murdered as I didn't just now.
Stay here, Alyosha, I'll go for a turn in the yard. My head's begun
to ache."

Alyosha went to his father's bedroom and sat by his bedside
behind the screen for about an hour. The old man suddenly opened
his eyes and gazed for a long while at Alyosha, evidently
remembering and meditating. All at once his face betrayed
extraordinary excitement.
