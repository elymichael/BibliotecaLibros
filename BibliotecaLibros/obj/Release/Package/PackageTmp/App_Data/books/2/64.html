<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>1<br/>In<br/>the Servants' Quarters<br/><br/><br/>THE Karamazovs' house was far from being in the centre of the<br/>town, but it was not quite outside it. It was a pleasant-looking<br/>old house of two stories, painted grey, with a red iron roof. It<br/>was roomy and snug, and might still last many years. There were all<br/>sorts of unexpected little cupboards and closets and staircases.<br/>There were rats in it, but Fyodor Pavlovitch did not altogether<br/>dislike them. "One doesn't feel so solitary when one's left alone<br/>in the evening," he used to say. It was his habit to send the<br/>servants away to the lodge for the night and to lock himself up<br/>alone. The lodge was a roomy and solid building in the yard. Fyodor<br/>Pavlovitch used to have the cooking done there, although there was<br/>a kitchen in the house; he did not like the smell of cooking, and,<br/>winter and summer alike, the dishes were carried in across the<br/>courtyard. The house was built for a large family; there was room<br/>for five times as many, with their servants. But at the time of our<br/>story there was no one living in the house but Fyodor Pavlovitch<br/>and his son Ivan. And in the lodge there were only three servants:<br/>old Grigory, and his old wife Marfa, and a young man called<br/>Smerdyakov. Of these three we must say a few words. Of old Grigory<br/>we have said something already. He was firm and determined and went<br/>blindly and obstinately for his object, if once be had been brought<br/>by any reasons (and they were often very illogical ones) to believe<br/>that it was immutably right. He was honest and incorruptible. His<br/>wife, Marfa Ignatyevna, had obeyed her husband's will implicitly<br/>all her life, yet she had pestered him terribly after the<br/>emancipation of the serfs. She was set on leaving Fyodor Pavlovitch<br/>and opening a little shop in Moscow with their small savings. But<br/>Grigory decided then, once for all, that "the woman's talking<br/>nonsense, for every woman is dishonest," and that they ought not to<br/>leave their old master, whatever he might be, for "that was now<br/>their duty."<br/><br/>"Do you understand what duty is?" he asked Marfa Ignatyevna.<br/><br/>"I understand what duty means, Grigory Vassilyevitch, but why<br/>it's our duty to stay here I never shall understand," Marfa<br/>answered firmly.<br/><br/>"Well, don't understand then. But so it shall be. And you hold<br/>your tongue."<br/><br/>And so it was. They did not go away, and Fyodor Pavlovitch<br/>promised them a small sum for wages, and paid it regularly. Grigory<br/>knew, too, that he had an indisputable influence over his master.<br/>It was true, and he was aware of it. Fyodor Pavlovitch was an<br/>obstinate and cunning buffoon, yet, though his will was strong<br/>enough "in some of the affairs of life," as he expressed it, he<br/>found himself, to his surprise, extremely feeble in facing certain<br/>other emergencies. He knew his weaknesses and was afraid of them.<br/>There are positions in which one has to keep a sharp lookout. And<br/>that's not easy without a trustworthy man, and Grigory was a most<br/>trustworthy man. Many times in the course of his life Fyodor<br/>Pavlovitch had only just escaped a sound thrashing through<br/>Grigory's intervention, and on each occasion the old servant gave<br/>him a good lecture. But it wasn't only thrashings that Fyodor<br/>Pavlovitch was afraid of. There were graver occasions, and very<br/>subtle and complicated ones, when Fyodor Pavlovitch could not have<br/>explained the extraordinary craving for someone faithful and<br/>devoted, which sometimes unaccountably came upon him all in a<br/>moment. It was almost a morbid condition. Corrupt and often cruel<br/>in his lust, like some noxious insect, Fyodor Pavlovitch was<br/>sometimes, in moments of drunkenness, overcome by superstitious<br/>terror and a moral convulsion which took an almost physical form.<br/>"My soul's simply quaking in my throat at those times," he used to<br/>say. At such moments he liked to feel that there was near at hand,<br/>in the lodge if not in the room, a strong, faithful man, virtuous<br/>and unlike himself, who had seen all his debauchery and knew all<br/>his secrets, but was ready in his devotion to overlook all that,<br/>not to oppose him, above all, not to reproach him or threaten him<br/>with anything, either in this world or in the next, and, in case of<br/>need, to defend him- from whom? From somebody unknown, but terrible<br/>and dangerous. What he needed was to feel that there was another<br/>man, an old and tried friend, that he might call him in his sick<br/>moments merely to look at his face, or, perhaps, exchange some<br/>quite irrelevant words with him. And if the old servant were not<br/>angry, he felt comforted, and if he were angry, he was more<br/>dejected. It happened even (very rarely however) that Fyodor<br/>Pavlovitch went at night to the lodge to wake Grigory and fetch him<br/>for a moment. When the old man came, Fyodor Pavlovitch would begin<br/>talking about the most trivial matters, and would soon let him go<br/>again, sometimes even with a jest. And after he had gone, Fyodor<br/>Pavlovitch would get into bed with a curse and sleep the sleep of<br/>the just. Something of the same sort had happened to Fyodor<br/>Pavlovitch on Alyosha's arrival. Alyosha "pierced his heart" by<br/>"living with him, seeing everything and blaming nothing." Moreover,<br/>Alyosha brought with him something his father had never known<br/>before: a complete absence of contempt for him and an invariable<br/>kindness, a perfectly natural unaffected devotion to the old man<br/>who deserved it so little. All this was a complete surprise to the<br/>old profligate, who had dropped all family ties. It was a new and<br/>surprising experience for him, who had till then loved nothing but<br/>"evil." When Alyosha had left him, he confessed to himself that he<br/>had learnt something he had not till then been willing to<br/>learn.<br/><br/>I have mentioned already that Grigory had detested Adelaida<br/>Ivanovna, the first wife of Fyodor Pavlovitch and the mother of<br/>Dmitri, and that he had, on the contrary, protected Sofya Ivanovna,<br/>the poor "crazy woman," against his master and anyone who chanced<br/>to speak ill or lightly of her. His sympathy for the unhappy wife<br/>had become something sacred to him, so that even now, twenty years<br/>after, he could not bear a slighting allusion to her from anyone,<br/>and would at once check the offender. Externally, Grigory was cold,<br/>dignified and taciturn, and spoke, weighing his words, without<br/>frivolity. It was impossible to tell at first sight whether he<br/>loved his meek, obedient wife; but he really did love her, and she<br/>knew it.<br/><br/>Marfa Ignatyevna was by no means foolish; she was probably,<br/>indeed, cleverer than her husband, or, at least, more prudent than<br/>he in worldly affairs, and yet she had given in to him in<br/>everything without question or complaint ever since her marriage,<br/>and respected him for his spiritual superiority. It was remarkable<br/>how little they spoke to one another in the course of their lives,<br/>and only of the most necessary daily affairs. The grave and<br/>dignified Grigory thought over all his cares and duties alone, so<br/>that Marfa Ignatyevna had long grown used to knowing that he did<br/>not need her advice. She felt that her husband respected her<br/>silence, and took it as a sign of her good sense. He had never<br/>beaten her but once, and then only slightly. Once during the year<br/>after Fyodor Pavlovitch's marriage with Adelaida Ivanovna, the<br/>village girls and women- at that time serfs- were called together<br/>before the house to sing and dance. They were beginning "In the<br/>Green Meadows," when Marfa, at that time a young woman, skipped<br/>forward and danced "the Russian Dance," not in the village fashion,<br/>but as she had danced it when she was a servant in the service of<br/>the rich Miusov family, in their private theatre, where the actors<br/>were taught to dance by a dancing master from Moscow. Grigory saw<br/>how his wife danced, and, an hour later, at home in their cottage<br/>he gave her a lesson, pulling her hair a little. But there it<br/>ended: the beating was never repeated, and Marfa Ignatyevna gave up<br/>dancing.<br/>
