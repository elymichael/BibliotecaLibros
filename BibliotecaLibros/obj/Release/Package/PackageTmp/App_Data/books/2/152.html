<br/>"Mamma, mamma, my dear, give over! You are not lonely. Everyone<br/>loves you, everyone adores you." He began kissing both her hands<br/>again and tenderly stroking her face; taking the dinner-napkin, he<br/>began wiping away her tears. Alyosha fancied that he too had tears<br/>in his eyes. "There, you see, you hear?" he turned with a sort of<br/>fury to Alyosha, pointing to the poor imbecile.<br/><br/>"I see and hear," muttered Alyosha.<br/><br/>"Father, father, how can you- with him! Let him alone!" cried<br/>the boy, sitting up in his bed and gazing at his father with<br/>glowing eyes.<br/><br/>"Do give over fooling, showing off your silly antics which never<br/>lead to anything! shouted Varvara, stamping her foot with<br/>passion.<br/><br/>"Your anger is quite just this time, Varvara, and I'll make<br/>haste to satisfy you. Come, put on your cap, Alexey Fyodorovitch,<br/>and I'll put on mine. We will go out. I have a word to say to you<br/>in earnest, but not within these walls. This girl sitting here is<br/>my daughter Nina; I forgot to introduce her to you. She is a<br/>heavenly angel incarnate… who has flown down to us mortals,… if you<br/>can understand."<br/><br/>"There he is shaking all over, as though he is in convulsions!"<br/>Varvara went on indignantly.<br/><br/>"And she there stamping her foot at me and calling me a fool<br/>just now, she is a heavenly angel incarnate too, and she has good<br/>reason to call me so. Come along, Alexey Fyodorovitch, we must make<br/>an end."<br/><br/>And, snatching Alyosha's hand, he drew him out of the room into<br/>the street.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
