<br/>Ivan shook. "Get away, miserable idiot. What have I to do with<br/>you?" was on the tip of his tongue, but to his profound<br/>astonishment he heard himself say, "Is my father still asleep, or<br/>has he waked?"<br/><br/>He asked the question softly and meekly, to his own surprise,<br/>and at once, again to his own surprise, sat down on the bench. For<br/>an instant he felt almost frightened; he remembered it afterwards.<br/>Smerdyakov stood facing him, his hands behind his back, looking at<br/>him with assurance and almost severity.<br/><br/>"His honour is still asleep," he articulated deliberately ("You<br/>were the first to speak, not I," he seemed to say). "I am surprised<br/>at you, sir," he added, after a pause, dropping his eyes<br/>affectedly, setting his right foot forward, and playing with the<br/>tip of his polished boot.<br/><br/>"Why are you surprised at me?" Ivan asked abruptly and sullenly,<br/>doing his utmost to restrain himself, and suddenly realising, with<br/>disgust, that he was feeling intense curiosity and would not, on<br/>any account, have gone away without satisfying it.<br/><br/>"Why don't you go to Tchermashnya, sir?" Smerdyakov suddenly<br/>raised his eyes and smiled familiarly. "Why I smile you must<br/>understand of yourself, if you are a clever man," his screwed-up<br/>left eye seemed to say.<br/><br/>"Why should I go to Tchermashnya?" Ivan asked in surprise.<br/><br/>Smerdyakov was silent again.<br/><br/>"Fyodor Pavlovitch himself has so begged you to," he said at<br/>last, slowly and apparently attaching no significance to his<br/>answer. "I put you off with a secondary reason," he seemed to<br/>suggest, "simply to say something."<br/><br/>"Damn you! Speak out what you want!" Ivan cried angrily at last,<br/>passing from meekness to violence.<br/><br/>Smerdyakov drew his right foot up to his left, pulled himself<br/>up, but still looked at him with the same serenity and the same<br/>little smile.<br/><br/>
