<br/>"You mean, 'steal it'? Speak out plainly now. Yes, I consider<br/>that I practically stole it, but, if you prefer, I 'appropriated<br/>it.' I consider I stole it. And last night I stole it finally."<br/><br/>"Last night? But you said that it's a month since you… obtained<br/>it?… "<br/><br/>"Yes. But not from my father. Not from my father, don't be<br/>uneasy. I didn't steal it from my father, but from her. Let me tell<br/>you without interrupting. It's hard to do, you know. You see, a<br/>month ago, I was sent for by Katerina Ivanovna, formerly my<br/>betrothed. Do you know her?"<br/><br/>"Yes, of course."<br/><br/>"I know you know her. She's a noble creature, noblest of the<br/>noble. But she has hated me ever so long, oh, ever so long… and<br/>hated me with good reason, good reason!"<br/><br/>"Katerina Ivanovna!" Nikolay Parfenovitch exclaimed with wonder.<br/>The prosecutor, too, stared.<br/><br/>"Oh, don't take her name in vain! I'm a scoundrel to bring her<br/>into it. Yes, I've seen that she hated me… a long while… . From the<br/>very first, even that evening at my lodging… but enough, enough.<br/>You're unworthy even to know of that. No need of that at all… . I<br/>need only tell you that she sent for me a month ago, gave me three<br/>thousand roubles to send off to her sister and another relation in<br/>Moscow (as though she couldn't have sent it off herself!) and I… it<br/>was just at that fatal moment in my life when I… well, in fact,<br/>when I'd just come to love another, her, she's sitting down below<br/>now, Grushenka. I carried her off here to Mokroe then, and wasted<br/>here in two days half that damned three thousand, but the other<br/>half I kept on me. Well, I've kept that other half, that fifteen<br/>hundred, like a locket round my neck, but yesterday I undid it, and<br/>spent it. What's left of it, eight hundred roubles, is in your<br/>hands now, Nikolay Parfenovitch. That's the change out of the<br/>fifteen hundred I had yesterday."<br/><br/>"Excuse me. How's that? Why, when you were here a month ago you<br/>spent three thousand, not fifteen hundred, everybody knows<br/>that."<br/><br/>"Who knows it? Who counted the money? Did I let anyone count<br/>it?"<br/><br/>"Why, you told everyone yourself that you'd spent exactly three<br/>thousand."<br/><br/>
