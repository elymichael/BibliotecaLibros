<br/>"No one can hear anything. You've seen for yourself: there's a<br/>passage."<br/><br/>"Listen, my good fellow; what was that you babbled, as I was<br/>leaving the hospital, that if I said nothing about your faculty of<br/>shamming fits, you wouldn't tell the investigating lawyer all our<br/>conversation at the gate? What do you mean by all? What could you<br/>mean by it? Were you threatening me? Have I entered into some sort<br/>of compact with you? Do you suppose I am afraid of you?"<br/><br/>Ivan said this in a perfect fury, giving him to understand with<br/>obvious intention that he scorned any subterfuge or indirectness<br/>and meant to show his cards. Smerdyakov's eyes gleamed resentfully,<br/>his left eye winked, and he at once gave his answer, with his<br/>habitual composure and deliberation. "You want to have everything<br/>above-board; very well, you shall have it," he seemed to say.<br/><br/>"This is what I meant then, and this is why I said that, that<br/>you, knowing beforehand of this murder of your own parent, left him<br/>to his fate, and that people mightn't after that conclude any evil<br/>about your feelings and perhaps of something else, too- that's what<br/>I promised not to tell the authorities."<br/><br/>Though Smerdyakov spoke without haste and obviously controlling<br/>himself, yet there was something in his voice, determined and<br/>emphatic, resentful and insolently defiant. He stared impudently at<br/>Ivan. A mist passed before Ivan's eyes for the first moment.<br/><br/>"How? What? Are you out of your mind?"<br/><br/>"I'm perfectly in possession of all my faculties."<br/><br/>"Do you suppose I knew of the murder?" Ivan cried at last, and<br/>he brought his fist violently on the table. "What do you mean by<br/>'something else, too'? Speak, scoundrel!"<br/><br/>Smerdyakov was silent and still scanned Ivan with the same<br/>insolent stare.<br/><br/>"Speak, you stinking rogue, what is that 'something else,<br/>too'?"<br/><br/>
