"How could I have said it more directly then? It was simply my<br/>fear that made me speak, and you might have been angry, too. I<br/>might well have been apprehensive that Dmitri Fyodorovitch would<br/>make a scene and carry away that money, for he considered it as<br/>good as his own; but who could tell that it would end in a murder<br/>like this? I thought that he would only carry off the three<br/>thousand that lay under the master's mattress in the envelope, and<br/>you see, he's murdered him. How could you guess it either,<br/>sir?"<br/><br/>"But if you say yourself that it couldn't be guessed, how could<br/>I have guessed and stayed at home? You contradict yourself!" said<br/>Ivan, pondering.<br/><br/>"You might have guessed from my sending you to Tchermashnya and<br/>not to Moscow."<br/><br/>"How could I guess it from that?"<br/><br/>Smerdyakov seemed much exhausted, and again he was silent for a<br/>minute.<br/><br/>"You might have guessed from the fact of my asking you not to go<br/>to Moscow, but to Tchermashnya, that I wanted to have you nearer,<br/>for Moscow's a long way off, and Dmitri Fyodorovitch, knowing you<br/>are not far off, would not be so bold. And if anything had<br/>happened, you might have come to protect me, too, for I warned you<br/>of Grigory Vassilyevitch's illness, and that I was afraid of having<br/>a fit. And when I explained those knocks to you, by means of which<br/>one could go in to the deceased, and that Dmitri Fyodorovitch knew<br/>them all through me, I thought that you would guess yourself that<br/>he would be sure to do something, and so wouldn't go to<br/>Tchermashnya even, but would stay."<br/><br/>"He talks very coherently," thought Ivan, "though he does<br/>mumble; what's the derangement of his faculties that Herzenstube<br/>talked of?"<br/><br/>"You are cunning with me, damn you!" he exclaimed, getting<br/>angry.<br/><br/>"But I thought at the time that you quite guessed," Smerdyakov<br/>parried with the simplest air.<br/><br/>"If I'd guessed, I should have stayed," cried Ivan.<br/><br/>"Why, I thought that it was because you guessed, that you went<br/>away in such a hurry, only to get out of trouble, only to run away<br/>and save yourself in your fright."<br/>
