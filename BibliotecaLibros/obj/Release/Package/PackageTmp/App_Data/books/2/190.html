"I'm bound to admit the fact," Smerdyakov drawled with pedantic<br/>composure, "that I have a secret with Fyodor Pavlovitch in this<br/>business. As you know yourself (if only you do know it) he has for<br/>several days past locked himself in as soon as night or even<br/>evening comes on. Of late you've been going upstairs to your room<br/>early every evening, and yesterday you did not come down at all,<br/>and so perhaps you don't know how carefully he has begun to lock<br/>himself in at night, and even if Grigory Vassilyevitch comes to the<br/>door he won't open to him till he hears his voice. But Grigory<br/>Vassilyevitch does not come, because I wait upon him alone in his<br/>room now. That's the arrangement he made himself ever since this<br/>to-do with Agrafena Alexandrovna began. But at night, by his<br/>orders, I go away to the lodge so that I don't get to sleep till<br/>midnight, but am on the watch, getting up and walking about the<br/>yard, waiting for Agrafena Alexandrovna to come. For the last few<br/>days he's been perfectly frantic expecting her. What he argues is,<br/>she is afraid of him, Dmitri Fyodorovitch (Mitya, as he calls him),<br/>'and so,' says he, 'she'll come the back-way, late at night, to me.<br/>You look out for her,' says he, 'till midnight and later; and if<br/>she does come, you run up and knock at my door or at the window<br/>from the garden. Knock at first twice, rather gently, and then<br/>three times more quickly, then,' says he, 'I shall understand at<br/>once that she has come, and will open the door to you quietly.'<br/>Another signal he gave me in case anything unexpected happens. At<br/>first, two knocks, and then, after an interval, another much<br/>louder. Then he will understand that something has happened<br/>suddenly and that I must see him, and he will open to me so that I<br/>can go and speak to him. That's all in case Agrafena Alexandrovna<br/>can't come herself, but sends a message. Besides, Dmitri<br/>Fyodorovitch might come, too, so I must let him know he is near.<br/>His honour is awfully afraid of Dmitri Fyodorovitch, so that even<br/>if Agrafena Alexandrovna had come and were locked in with him, and<br/>Dmitri Fyodorovitch were to turn up anywhere near at the time, I<br/>should be bound to let him know at once, knocking three times. So<br/>that the first signal of five knocks means Agrafena Alexandrovna<br/>has come, while the second signal of three knocks means 'something<br/>important to tell you.' His honour has shown me them several times<br/>and explained them. And as in the whole universe no one knows of<br/>these signals but myself and his honour, so he'd open the door<br/>without the slightest hesitation and without calling out (he is<br/>awfully afraid of calling out aloud). Well, those signals are known<br/>to Dmitri Fyodorovitch too, now."<br/><br/>"How are they known? Did you tell him? How dared you tell<br/>him?"<br/><br/>"It was through fright I did it. How could I dare to keep it<br/>back from him? Dmitri Fyodorovitch kept persisting every day, 'You<br/>are deceiving me, you are hiding something from me! I'll break both<br/>your legs for you.' So I told him those secret signals that he<br/>might see my slavish devotion, and might be satisfied that I was<br/>not deceiving him, but was telling him all I could."<br/><br/>"If you think that he'll make use of those signals and try to<br/>get in, don't let him in."<br/><br/>"But if I should be laid up with a fit, how can I prevent him<br/>coming in then, even if I dared prevent him, knowing how desperate<br/>he is?"<br/><br/>"Hang it! How can you be so sure you are going to have a fit,<br/>confound you? Are you laughing at me?"<br/><br/>"How could I dare laugh at you? I am in no laughing humour with<br/>this fear on me. I feel I am going to have a fit. I have a<br/>presentiment. Fright alone will bring it on."<br/><br/>"Confound it! If you are laid up, Grigory will be on the watch.<br/>Let Grigory know beforehand; he will be sure not to let him<br/>in."<br/><br/>"I should never dare to tell Grigory Vassilyevitch about the<br/>signals without orders from my master. And as for Grigory<br/>Vassilyevitch hearing him and not admitting him, he has been ill<br/>ever since yesterday, and Marfa Ignatyevna intends to give him<br/>medicine to-morrow. They've just arranged it. It's a very strange<br/>remedy of hers. Marfa Ignatyevna knows of a preparation and always<br/>keeps it. It's a strong thing made from some herb. She has the<br/>secret of it, and she always gives it to Grigory Vassilyevitch<br/>three times a year when his lumbago's so bad he is almost paralysed<br/>by it. Then she takes a towel, wets it with the stuff, and rubs his<br/>whole back for half an hour till it's quite red and swollen, and<br/>what's left in the bottle she gives him to drink with a special<br/>prayer; but not quite all, for on such occasions she leaves some<br/>for herself, and drinks it herself. And as they never take strong<br/>drink, I assure you they both drop asleep at once and sleep sound a<br/>very long time. And when Grigory Vassilyevitch wakes up he is<br/>perfectly well after it, but Marfa Ignatyevna always has a headache<br/>from it. So, if Marfa Ignatyevna carries out her intention<br/>to-morrow, they won't hear anything and hinder Dmitri Fyodorovitch.<br/>They'll be asleep."<br/><br/>"What a rigmarole! And it all seems to happen at once, as though<br/>it were planned. You'll have a fit and they'll both be<br/>unconscious," cried Ivan. "But aren't you trying to arrange it so?"<br/>broke from him suddenly, and he frowned threateningly.<br/><br/>"How could I?… And why should I, when it all depends on Dmitri<br/>Fyodorovitch and his plans?… If he means to do anything, he'll do<br/>it; but if not, I shan't be thrusting him upon his father."<br/>
