"I came in from the back-alley, over the fence, and went<br/>straight to the summer-house. I hope you'll forgive me, he added<br/>addressing Marya Kondratyevna. "I was in a hurry to find my<br/>brother."<br/><br/>"Ach, as though we could take it amiss in you!" drawled Marya<br/>Kondratyevna, flattered by Alyosha's apology. "For Dmitri<br/>Fyodorovitch often goes to the summer-house in that way. We don't<br/>know he is here and he is sitting in the summer-house."<br/><br/>"I am very anxious to find him, or to learn from you where he is<br/>now. Believe me, it's on business of great importance to him."<br/><br/>"He never tells us," lisped Marya Kondratyevna.<br/><br/>"Though I used to come here as a friend," Smerdyakov began<br/>again, "Dmitri Fyodorovitch has pestered me in a merciless way even<br/>here by his incessant questions about the master. 'What news?'<br/>he'll ask. 'What's going on in there now? Who's coming and going?'<br/>and can't I tell him something more. Twice already he's threatened<br/>me with death<br/><br/>"With death?" Alyosha exclaimed in surprise.<br/><br/>"Do you suppose he'd think much of that, with his temper, which<br/>you had a chance of observing yourself yesterday? He says if I let<br/>Agrafena Alexandrovna in and she passes the night there, I'll be<br/>the first to suffer for it. I am terribly afraid of him, and if I<br/>were not even more afraid of doing so, I ought to let the police<br/>know. God only knows what he might not do!"<br/><br/>"His honour said to him the other day, 'I'll pound you in a<br/>mortar!'" added Marya Kondratyevna.<br/><br/>"Oh, if it's pounding in a mortar, it may be only talk,"<br/>observed Alyosha. "If I could meet him, I might speak to him about<br/>that too."<br/><br/>"Well, the only thing I can tell you is this," said Smerdyakov,<br/>as though thinking better of it; "I am here as an old friend and<br/>neighbour, and it would be odd if I didn't come. On the other hand,<br/>Ivan Fyodorovitch sent me first thing this morning to your<br/>brother's lodging in Lake Street, without a letter, but with a<br/>message to Dmitri Fyodorovitch to go to dine with him at the<br/>restaurant here, in the marketplace. I went, but didn't find Dmitri<br/>Fyodorovitch at home, though it was eight o'clock. 'He's been here,<br/>but he is quite gone,' those were the very words of his landlady.<br/>It's as though there was an understanding between them. Perhaps at<br/>this moment he is in the restaurant with Ivan Fyodorovitch, for<br/>Ivan Fyodorovitch has not been home to dinner and Fyodor Pavlovitch<br/>dined alone an hour ago, and is gone to lie down. But I beg you<br/>most particularly not to speak of me and of what I have told you,<br/>for he'd kill me for nothing at all."<br/><br/>"Brother Ivan invited Dmitri to the restaurant to-day?" repeated<br/>Alyosha quickly.<br/>
