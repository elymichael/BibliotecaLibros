<br/>I took the book again, opened it in another place and showed him<br/>the Epistle to the Hebrews, chapter 10, verse 31. He read:<br/><br/>"It is a fearful thing to fall<br/><br/>into the hands of the living God."<br/><br/>He read it and simply flung down the book. He was trembling all<br/>over.<br/><br/>"An awful text," he said. "There's no denying you've picked out<br/>fitting ones." He rose from the chair. "Well!" he said, "good-bye,<br/>perhaps I shan't come again… we shall meet in heaven. So I have<br/>been for fourteen years 'in the hands of the living God,' that's<br/>how one must think of those fourteen years. To-morrow I will<br/>beseech those hands to let me go."<br/><br/>I wanted to take him in my arms and kiss him, but I did not<br/>dare- his face was contorted add sombre. He went away.<br/><br/>"Good God," I thought, "what has he gone to face!" I fell on my<br/>knees before the ikon and wept for him before the Holy Mother of<br/>God, our swift defender and helper. I was half an hour praying in<br/>tears, and it was late, about midnight. Suddenly I saw the door<br/>open and he came in again. I was surprised.<br/><br/>Where have you been?" I asked him.<br/><br/>"I think," he said, "I've forgotten something… my handkerchief,<br/>I think… . Well, even if I've not forgotten anything, let me stay a<br/>little."<br/><br/>He sat down. I stood over him.<br/><br/>
