Mitya remembered Andrey again, and ordered punch to be sent out
to him. "I was rude to him just now," he repeated with a sinking,
softened voice. Kalgonov did to drink, and at first did not care
for the girls singing; but after he had drunk a couple of glasses
of champagne he became extraordinarily lively, strolling about the
room, laughing and praising the music and the songs, admiring
everyone and everything. Maximov, blissfully drunk, never left his
side. Grushenka, too, was beginning to get drunk. Pointing to
Kalganov, she said to Mitya:

"What a dear, charming boy he is!"

And Mitya, delighted, ran to kiss Kalgonov and Maximov. Oh,
great were his hopes! She had said nothing yet, and seemed, indeed,
purposely to refrain from speaking. But she looked at him from time
to time with caressing and passionate eyes. At last she suddenly
gripped his hand and drew him vigorously to her. She was sitting at
the moment in the low chair by the door.

"How was it you came just now, eh? Have you walked in!… I was
frightened. So you wanted to give me up to him, did you? Did you
really want to?"

"I didn't want to spoil your happiness!" Mitya faltered
blissfully. But she did not need his answer.

"Well, go and enjoy yourself… " she sent him away once more.
"Don't cry, I'll call you back again."

He would run away and she listened to the singing and looked at
the dancing, though her eyes followed him wherever he went. But in
another quarter of an hour she would call him once more and again
he would run back to her.

"Come, sit beside me, tell me, how did you hear about me, and my
coming here yesterday? From whom did you first hear it?"

And Mitya began telling her all about it, disconnectedly,
incoherently, feverishly. He spoke strangely, often frowning, and
stopping abruptly.

"What are you frowning at?" she asked.
