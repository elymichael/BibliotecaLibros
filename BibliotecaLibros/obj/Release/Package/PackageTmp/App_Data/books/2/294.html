The officious shopmen began explaining with oily politeness that<br/>the first box contained only half a dozen bottles of champagne, and<br/>only "the most indispensable articles," such as savouries, sweets,<br/>toffee, etc. But the main part of the goods ordered would be packed<br/>and sent off, as on the previous occasion, in a special cart also<br/>with three horses travelling at full speed, so that it would arrive<br/>not more than an hour later than Dmitri Fyodorovitch himself.<br/><br/>"Not more than an hour! Not more than an hour! And put in more<br/>toffee and fondants. The girls there are so fond of it," Mitya<br/>insisted hotly.<br/><br/>"The fondants are all right. But what do you want with four<br/>dozen of champagne? One would be enough," said Pyotr Ilyitch,<br/>almost angry. He began bargaining, asking for a bill of the goods,<br/>and refused to be satisfied. But he only succeeded in saving a<br/>hundred roubles. In the end it was agreed that only three hundred<br/>roubles' worth should be sent.<br/><br/>"Well, you may go to the devil!" cried Pyotr Ilyitch, on second<br/>thoughts. "What's it to do with me? Throw away your money, since<br/>it's cost you nothing."<br/><br/>"This way, my economist, this way, don't be angry." Mitya drew<br/>him into a room at the back of the shop. "They'll give us a bottle<br/>here directly. We'll taste it. Ech, Pyotr Ilyitch, come along with<br/>me, for you're a nice fellow, the sort I like."<br/><br/>Mitya sat down on a wicker chair, before a little table, covered<br/>with a dirty dinner-napkin. Pyotr Ilyitch sat down opposite, and<br/>the champagne soon appeared, and oysters were suggested to the<br/>gentlemen. "First-class oysters, the last lot in."<br/><br/>"Hang the oysters. I don't eat them. And we don't need<br/>anything," cried Pyotr Ilyitch, almost angrily.<br/><br/>"There's no time for oysters," said Mitya. "And I'm not hungry.<br/>Do you know, friend," he said suddenly, with feeling, "I never have<br/>liked all this disorder."<br/><br/>"Who does like it? Three dozen of champagne for peasants, upon<br/>my word, that's enough to make anyone angry!"<br/><br/>"That's not what I mean. I'm talking of a higher order. There's<br/>no order in me, no higher order. Butâ€¦ that's all over. There's no<br/>need to grieve about it. It's too late, damn it! My whole life has<br/>been disorder, and one must set it in order. Is that a pun,<br/>eh?"<br/><br/>"You're raving, not making puns!<br/>
