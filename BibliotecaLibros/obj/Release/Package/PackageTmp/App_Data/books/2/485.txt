"I am glad to hear it," she snapped out maliciously, and she
suddenly blushed.

"You don't know me yet, Alexey Fyodorovitch," she said
menacingly. "And I don't know myself yet. Perhaps you'll want to
trample me under foot after my examination to-morrow."

"You will give your evidence honourably," said Alyosha; "that's
all that's wanted."

"Women are often dishonourable," she snarled. "Only an hour ago
I was thinking I felt afraid to touch that monster… as though he
were a reptile… but no, he is still a human being to me! But did he
do it? Is he the murderer?" she cried, all of a sudden,
hysterically, turning quickly to Ivan. Alyosha saw at once that she
had asked Ivan that question before, perhaps only a moment before
he came in, and not for the first time, but for the hundredth, and
that they had ended by quarrelling.

"I've been to see Smerdyakov… . It was you, you who persuaded me
that he murdered his father. It's only you I believed" she
continued, still addressing Ivan. He gave her a sort of strained
smile. Alyosha started at her tone. He had not suspected such
familiar intimacy between them.

"Well, that's enough, anyway," Ivan cut short the conversation.
"I am going. I'll come to-morrow." And turning at once, he walked
out of the room and went straight downstairs.

With an imperious gesture, Katerina Ivanovna seized Alyosha by
both hands.

"Follow him! Overtake him! Don't leave him alone for a minute!"
she said, in a hurried whisper. "He's mad! Don't you know that he's
mad? He is in a fever, nervous fever. The doctor told me so. Go,
run after him… ."

Alyosha jumped up and ran after Ivan, who was not fifty paces
ahead of him.

"What do you want?" He turned quickly on Alyosha, seeing that he
was running after him. "She told you to catch me up, because I'm
mad. I know it all by heart," he added irritably.

"She is mistaken, of course; but she is right that you are ill,"
said Alyosha. "I was looking at your face just now. You look very
ill, Ivan."
