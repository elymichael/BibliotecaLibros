<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>1<br/>Kolya Krassotkin<br/><br/><br/>IT was the beginning of November. There had been a hard frost,<br/>eleven degrees Reaumur, without snow, but a little dry snow had<br/>fallen on the frozen ground during the night, and a keen dry wind<br/>was lifting and blowing it along the dreary streets of our town,<br/>especially about the market-place. It was a dull morning, but the<br/>snow had ceased.<br/><br/>Not far from the market-place, close to Plotnikov's shop, there<br/>stood a small house, very clean both without and within. It<br/>belonged to Madame Krassotkin, the widow of a former provincial<br/>secretary, who had been dead for fourteen years. His widow, still a<br/>nice-looking woman of thirty-two, was living in her neat little<br/>house on her private means. She lived in respectable seclusion; she<br/>was of a soft but fairly cheerful disposition. She was about<br/>eighteen at the time of her husband's death; she had been married<br/>only a year and had just borne him a son. From the day of his death<br/>she had devoted herself heart and soul to the bringing up of her<br/>precious treasure, her boy Kolya. Though she had loved him<br/>passionately those fourteen years, he had caused her far more<br/>suffering than happiness. She had been trembling and fainting with<br/>terror almost every day, afraid he would fall ill, would catch<br/>cold, do something naughty, climb on a chair and fall off it, and<br/>so on and so on. When Kolya began going to school, the mother<br/>devoted herself to studying all the sciences with him so as to help<br/>him, and go through his lessons with him. She hastened to make the<br/>acquaintance of the teachers and their wives, even made up to<br/>Kolya's schoolfellows, and fawned upon them in the hope of thus<br/>saving Kolya from being teased, laughed at, or beaten by them. She<br/>went so far that the boys actually began to mock at him on her<br/>account and taunt him with being a "mother's darling."<br/><br/>But the boy could take his own part. He was a resolute boy,<br/>"tremendously strong," as was rumoured in his class, and soon<br/>proved to be the fact; he was agile, strong-willed, and of an<br/>audacious and enterprising temper. He was good at lessons, and<br/>there was a rumour in the school that he could beat the teacher,<br/>Dardanelov, at arithmetic and universal history. Though he looked<br/>down upon everyone, he was a good comrade and not supercilious. He<br/>accepted his schoolfellows' respect as his due, but was friendly<br/>with them. Above all, he knew where to draw the line. He could<br/>restrain himself on occasion, and in his relations with the<br/>teachers he never overstepped that last mystic limit beyond which a<br/>prank becomes an unpardonable breach of discipline. But he was as<br/>fond of mischief on every possible occasion as the smallest boy in<br/>the school, and not so much for the sake of mischief as for<br/>creating a sensation, inventing something, something effective and<br/>conspicuous. He was extremely vain. He knew how to make even his<br/>mother give way to him; he was almost despotic in his control of<br/>her. She gave way to him, oh, she had given way to him for years.<br/>The one thought unendurable to her was that her boy had no great<br/>love for her. She was always fancying that Kolya was "unfeeling" to<br/>her, and at times, dissolving into hysterical tears, she used to<br/>reproach him with his coldness. The boy disliked this, and the more<br/>demonstrations of feeling were demanded of him, the more he seemed<br/>intentionally to avoid them. Yet it was not intentional on his part<br/>but instinctive- it was his character. His mother was mistaken; he<br/>was very fond of her. He only disliked "sheepish sentimentality,"<br/>as he expressed it in his schoolboy language.<br/><br/>There was a bookcase in the house containing a few books that<br/>had been his father's. Kolya was fond of reading, and had read<br/>several of them by himself. His mother did not mind that and only<br/>wondered sometimes at seeing the boy stand for hours by the<br/>bookcase poring over a book instead of going to play. And in that<br/>way Kolya read some things unsuitable for his age.<br/><br/>Though the boy, as a rule, knew where to draw the line in his<br/>mischief, he had of late begun to play pranks that caused his<br/>mother serious alarm. It is true there was nothing vicious in what<br/>he did, but a wild mad recklessness.<br/><br/>It happened that July, during the summer holidays, that the<br/>mother and son went to another district, forty-five miles away, to<br/>spend a week with a distant relation, whose husband was an official<br/>at the railway station (the very station, the nearest one to our<br/>town, from which a month later Ivan Fyodorovitch Karamazov set off<br/>for Moscow). There Kolya began by carefully investigating every<br/>detail connected with the railways, knowing that he could impress<br/>his schoolfellows when he got home with his newly acquired<br/>knowledge. But there happened to be some other boys in the place<br/>with whom he soon made friends. Some of them were living at the<br/>station, others in the neighbourhood; there were six or seven of<br/>them, all between twelve and fifteen, and two of them came from our<br/>town. The boys played together, and on the fourth or fifth day of<br/>Kolya's stay at the station, a mad bet was made by the foolish<br/>boys. Kolya, who was almost the youngest of the party and rather<br/>looked down upon by the others in consequence, was moved by vanity<br/>or by reckless bravado to bet them two roubles that he would lie<br/>down between the rails at night when the eleven o'clock train was<br/>due, and would lie there without moving while the train rolled over<br/>him at full speed. It is true they made a preliminary<br/>investigation, from which it appeared that it was possible to lie<br/>so flat between the rails that the train could pass over without<br/>touching, but to lie there was no joke! Kolya maintained stoutly<br/>that he would. At first they laughed at him, called him a little<br/>liar, a braggart, but that only egged him on. What piqued him most<br/>was that these boys of fifteen turned up their noses at him too<br/>superciliously, and were at first disposed to treat him as "a small<br/>boy," not fit to associate with them, and that was an unendurable<br/>insult. And so it was resolved to go in the evening, half a mile<br/>from the station, so that the train might have time to get up full<br/>speed after leaving the station The boys assembled. It was a<br/>pitch-dark night without a moon. At the time fixed, Kolya lay down<br/>between the rails. The five others who had taken the bet waited<br/>among the bushes below the embankment, their hearts beating with<br/>suspense, which was followed by alarm and remorse. At last they<br/>heard in the distance the rumble of the train leaving the station.<br/>Two red lights gleamed out of the darkness; the monster roared as<br/>it approached.<br/><br/>"Run, run away from the rails," the boys cried to Kolya from the<br/>bushes, breathless with terror. But it was too late: the train<br/>darted up and flew past. The boys rushed to Kolya. He lay without<br/>moving. They began pulling at him, lifting him up. He suddenly got<br/>up and walked away without a word. Then he explained that he had<br/>lain there as though he were insensible to frighten them, but the<br/>fact was that he really had lost consciousness, as he confessed<br/>long after to his mother. In this way his reputation as "a<br/>desperate character," was established for ever. He returned home to<br/>the station as white as a sheet. Next day he had a slight attack of<br/>nervous fever, but he was in high spirits and well pleased with<br/>himself. The incident did not become known at once, but when they<br/>came back to the town it penetrated to the school and even reached<br/>the ears of the masters. But then Kolya's mother hastened to<br/>entreat the masters on her boy's behalf, and in the end Dardanelov,<br/>a respected and influential teacher, exerted himself in his favour,<br/>and the affair was ignored.<br/>
