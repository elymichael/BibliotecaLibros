"Where have you taken him away? Where have you taken him?" the
lunatic cried in a heart-rending voice. Nina, too, broke into sobs.
Kolya ran out of the room, the boys followed him. At last Alyosha
too went out.

"Let them weep," he said to Kolya, "it's no use trying to
comfort them just now. Let wait a minute and then go back."

"No, it's no use, it's awful," Kolya assented. "Do you know,
Karamazov," he dropped his voice so that no one could hear them, "I
feel dreadfully sad, and if it were only possible to bring him
back, I'd give anything in the world to do it."

"Ah, so would I," said Alyosha.

"What do you think, Karamazov? Had we better come back here
to-night? He'll be drunk, you know."

"Perhaps he will. Let us come together, you and I, that will be
enough, to spend an hour with them, with the mother and Nina. If we
all come together we shall remind them of everything again,"
Alyosha suggested.

"The landlady is laying the table for them now- there'll be a
funeral dinner or something, the priest is coming; shall we go back
to it, Karamazov?"

"Of course," said Alyosha.

"It's all so strange, Karamazov, such sorrow and then pancakes
after it, it all seems so unnatural in our religion."

"They are going to have salmon, too," the boy who had discovered
about Troy observed in a loud voice.

"I beg you most earnestly, Kartashov, not to interrupt again
with your idiotic remarks, especially when one is not talking to
you and doesn't care to know whether you exist or not!" Kolya
snapped out irritably. The boy flushed crimson but did not dare to
reply.
