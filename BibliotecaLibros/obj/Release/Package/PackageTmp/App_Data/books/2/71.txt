"And you were going the backway! Oh, gods, I thank you for
sending him by the backway, and he came to me like the golden fish
to the silly old fishermen in the fable! Listen, Alyosha, listen,
brother! Now I mean to tell you everything, for I must tell
someone. An angel in heaven I've told already; but I want to tell
an angel on earth. You are an angel on earth. You will hear and
judge and forgive. And that's what I need, that someone above me
should forgive. Listen! If two people break away from everything on
earth and fly off into the unknown, or at least one of them, and
before flying off or going to ruin he comes to someone else and
says, 'Do this for me'- some favour never asked before that could
only be asked on one's deathbed- would that other refuse, if he
were a friend or a brother?"

"I will do it, but tell me what it is, and make haste," said
Alyosha.

"Make haste! H'm!â€¦ Don't be in a hurry, Alyosha, you hurry and
worry yourself. There's no need to hurry now. Now the world has
taken a new turning. Ah, Alyosha, what a pity you can't understand
ecstasy. But what am I saying to him? As though you didn't
understand it. What an ass I am! What am I saying? 'Be noble, O
man!'- who says that?"

Alyosha made up his mind to wait. He felt that, perhaps, indeed,
his work lay here. Mitya sank into thought for a moment, with his
elbow on the table and his head in his hand. Both were silent.

"Alyosha," said Mitya, "you're the only one who won't laugh. I
should like to begin- my confession- with Schiller's Hymn to Joy,
An die Freude! I don't know German, I only know it's called that.
Don't think I'm talking nonsense because I'm drunk. I'm not a bit
drunk. Brandy's all very well, but I need two bottles to make me
drunk:

{verse

Silenus with his rosy phiz

Upon his stumbling ass.

{verse

But I've not drunk a quarter of a bottle, and I'm not Silenus.
I'm not Silenus, though I am strong,
