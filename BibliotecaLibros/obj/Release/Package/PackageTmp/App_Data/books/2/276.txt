"Just so, sir, I was only running out to Prohoritch'sâ€¦ But I
don't know you now."

"Tell me, my good woman, is Agrafena Alexandrovna there now?"
said Mitya, beside himself with suspense. "I saw her to the house
some time ago."

"She has been there, sir. She stayed a little while, and went
off again."

"What? Went away?" cried Mitya. "When did she go?"

"Why, as soon as she came. She only stayed a minute. She only
told Kuzma Kuzmitch a tale that made him laugh, and then she ran
away."

"You're lying, damn you!" roared Mitya.

"Aie! Aie!" shrieked the old woman, but Mitya had vanished.

He ran with all his might to the house where Grushenka lived. At
the moment he reached it, Grushenka was on her way to Mokroe. It
was not more than a quarter of an hour after her departure.

Fenya was sitting with her grandmother, the old cook, Matryona,
in the kitchen when "the captain" ran in. Fenya uttered a piercing
shriek on seeing him.
