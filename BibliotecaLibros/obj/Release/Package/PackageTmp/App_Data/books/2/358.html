On the contrary. You've expressed all that so well, Dmitri<br/>Fyodorovitch," Nikolay Parfenovitch answered with dignified<br/>approbation.<br/><br/>"And enough of those trivial questions, gentlemen, all those<br/>tricky questions! cried Mitya enthusiastically. "Or there's simply<br/>no knowing where we shall get to! Is there?"<br/><br/>"I will follow your sensible advice entirely," the prosecutor<br/>interposed, addressing Mitya. "I don't withdraw my question,<br/>however. It is now vitally important for us to know exactly why you<br/>needed that sum, I mean precisely three thousand."<br/><br/>"Why I needed it?… Oh, for one thing and another… . Well, it was<br/>to pay a debt."<br/><br/>"A debt to whom?"<br/><br/>"That I absolutely refuse to answer, gentlemen. Not because I<br/>couldn't, or because I shouldn't dare, or because it would be<br/>damaging, for it's all a paltry matter and absolutely trifling,<br/>but- I won't, because it's a matter of principle: that's my private<br/>life, and I won't allow any intrusion into my private life. That's<br/>my principle. Your question has no bearing on the case, and<br/>whatever has nothing to do with the case is my private affair. I<br/>wanted to pay a debt. I wanted to pay a debt of honour but to whom<br/>I won't say."<br/><br/>"Allow me to make a note of that," said the prosecutor.<br/><br/>"By all means. Write down that I won't say, that I won't. Write<br/>that I should think it dishonourable to say. Ech! you can write it;<br/>you've nothing else to do with your time."<br/><br/>"Allow me to caution you, sir, and to remind you once more, if<br/>you are unaware of it," the prosecutor began, with a peculiar and<br/>stern impressiveness, "that you have a perfect right not to answer<br/>the questions put to you now, and we on our side have no right to<br/>extort an answer from you, if you decline to give it for one reason<br/>or another. That is entirely a matter for your personal decision.<br/>But it is our duty, on the other hand, in such cases as the<br/>present, to explain and set before you the degree of injury you<br/>will be doing yourself by refusing to give this or that piece of<br/>evidence. After which I will beg you to continue."<br/><br/>"Gentlemen, I'm not angry… I… "Mitya muttered in a rather<br/>disconcerted tone. "Well, gentlemen, you see, that Samsonov to whom<br/>I went then… "<br/><br/>We will, of course, not reproduce his account of what is known<br/>to the reader already. Mitya was impatiently anxious not to omit<br/>the slightest detail. At the same time he was in a hurry to get it<br/>over. But as he gave his evidence it was written down, and<br/>therefore they had continually to pull him up. Mitya disliked this,<br/>but submitted; got angry, though still good-humouredly. He did, it<br/>is true, exclaim, from time to time, "Gentlemen, that's enough to<br/>make an angel out of patience!" Or, "Gentlemen, it's no good your<br/>irritating me."<br/>
