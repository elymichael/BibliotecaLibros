"It Was He Who Said That"


ALYOSHA coming in told Ivan that a little over an hour ago Marya
Kondratyevna had run to his rooms and informed him Smerdyakov had
taken his own life. "I went in to clear away the samovar and he was
hanging on a nail in the wall." On Alyosha's inquiring whether she
had informed the police, she answered that she had told no one,
"but I flew straight to you, I've run all the way." She seemed
perfectly crazy, Alyosha reported, and was shaking like a leaf.
When Alyosha ran with her to the cottage, he found Smerdyakov still
hanging. On the table lay a note: "I destroy my life of my own will
and desire, so as to throw no blame on anyone." Alyosha left the
note on the table and went straight to the police captain and told
him all about it. "And from him I've come straight to you," said
Alyosha, in conclusion, looking intently into Ivan's face. He had
not taken his eyes off him while he told his story, as though
struck by something in his expression.

"Brother," he cried suddenly, "you must be terribly ill. You
look and don't seem to understand what I tell you."

"It's a good thing you came," said Ivan, as though brooding, and
not hearing Alyosha's exclamation. "I knew he had hanged
himself."

"From whom?"

"I don't know. But I knew. Did I know? Yes, he told me. He told
me so just now."

Ivan stood in the middle of the room, and still spoke in the
same brooding tone, looking at the ground.

"Who is he?" asked Alyosha, involuntarily looking round.
