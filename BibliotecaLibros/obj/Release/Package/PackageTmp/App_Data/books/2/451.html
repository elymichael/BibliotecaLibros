<br/>"What, don't you believe in God?"<br/><br/>"Oh, I've nothing against God. Of course, God is only a<br/>hypothesis, but… I admit that He is needed… for the order of the<br/>universe and all that… and that if there were no God He would have<br/>to be invented," added Kolya, beginning to blush. He suddenly<br/>fancied that Alyosha might think he was trying to show off his<br/>knowledge and to prove that he was "grown up." "I haven't the<br/>slightest desire to show off my knowledge to him," Kolya thought<br/>indignantly. And all of a sudden he felt horribly annoyed.<br/><br/>"I must confess I can't endure entering on such discussions," he<br/>said with a final air. "It's possible for one who doesn't believe<br/>in God to love mankind, don't you think so? Voltaire didn't believe<br/>in God and loved mankind?" ("I am at it again," he thought to<br/>himself.)<br/><br/>"Voltaire believed in God, though not very much, I think, and I<br/>don't think he loved mankind very much either," said Alyosha<br/>quietly, gently, and quite naturally, as though he were talking to<br/>someone of his own age, or even older. Kolya was particularly<br/>struck by Alyosha's apparent diffidence about his opinion of<br/>Voltaire. He seemed to be leaving the question for him, little<br/>Kolya, to settle.<br/><br/>"Have you read Voltaire?" Alyosha finished.<br/><br/>"No, not to say read… . But I've read Candide in the Russian<br/>translation… in an absurd, grotesque, old translation.. (At it<br/>again! again!)"<br/><br/>"And did you understand it?"<br/><br/>"Oh, yes, everything… . That is… Why do you suppose I shouldn't<br/>understand it? There's a lot of nastiness in it, of course… . Of<br/>course I can understand that it's a philosophical novel and written<br/>to advocate an idea… ." Kolya was getting mixed by now. "I am a<br/>Socialist, Karamazov, I am an incurable Socialist," he announced<br/>suddenly, apropos of nothing.<br/><br/>"A Socialist?" laughed Alyosha. "But when have you had time to<br/>become one? Why, I thought you were only thirteen?"<br/><br/>Kolya winced.<br/><br/>
