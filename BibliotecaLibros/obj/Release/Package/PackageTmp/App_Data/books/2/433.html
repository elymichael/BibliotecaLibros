<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>4<br/>The Lost Dog<br/><br/><br/>KOLYA leaned against the fence with an air of dignity, waiting<br/>for Alyosha to appear. Yes, he had long wanted to meet him. He had<br/>heard a great deal about him from the boys, but hitherto he had<br/>always maintained an appearance of disdainful indifference when he<br/>was mentioned, and he had even "criticised" what he heard about<br/>Alyosha. But secretely he had a great longing to make his<br/>acquaintance; there was something sympathetic and attractive in all<br/>he was told about Alyosha. So the present moment was important: to<br/>begin with, he had to show himself at his best, to show his<br/>independence. "Or he'll think of me as thirteen and take me for a<br/>boy, like the rest of them. And what are these boys to him? I shall<br/>ask him when I get to know him. It's a pity I am so short, though.<br/>Tuzikov is younger than I am, yet he is half a head taller. But I<br/>have a clever face. I am not good-looking. I know I'm hideous, but<br/>I've a clever face. I mustn't talk too freely; if I fall into his<br/>arms all at once, he may think- Tfoo! how horrible if he should<br/>think-&#160;!"<br/><br/>Such were the thoughts that excited Kolya while he was doing his<br/>utmost to assume the most independent air. What distressed him most<br/>was his being so short; he did not mind so much his "hideous" face,<br/>as being so short. On the wall in a corner at home he had the year<br/>before made a pencil-mark to show his height, and every two months<br/>since he anxiously measured himself against it to see how much he<br/>had gained. But alas! he grew very slowly, and this sometimes<br/>reduced him almost to despair. His face was in reality by no means<br/>"hideous"; on the contrary, it was rather attractive, with a fair,<br/>pale skin, freckled. His small, lively grey eyes had a fearless<br/>look, and often glowed with feeling. He had rather high cheekbones;<br/>small, very red, but not very thick, lips; his nose was small and<br/>unmistakably turned up. "I've a regular pug nose, a regular pug<br/>nose," Kolya used to mutter to himself when he looked in the<br/>looking-glass, and he always left it with indignation. "But perhaps<br/>I haven't got a clever face?" he sometimes thought, doubtful even<br/>of that. But it must not be supposed that his mind was preoccupied<br/>with his face and his height. On the contrary, however bitter the<br/>moments before the looking-glass were to him, he quickly forgot<br/>them, and forgot them for a long time, "abandoning himself entirely<br/>to ideas and to real life," as he formulated it to himself.<br/><br/>Alyosha came out quickly and hastened up to Kolya. Before he<br/>reached him, Kolya could see that he looked delighted. "Can he be<br/>so glad to see me?" Kolya wondered, feeling pleased. We may note<br/>here, in passing, that Alyosha's appearance had undergone a<br/>complete change since we saw him last. He had abandoned his cassock<br/>and was wearing now a wellcut coat, a soft, round hat, and his hair<br/>had been cropped short. All this was very becoming to him, and he<br/>looked quite handsome. His charming face always had a good-humoured<br/>expression; but there was a gentleness and serenity in his<br/>good-humour. To Kolya's surprise, Alyosha came out to him just as<br/>he was, without an overcoat. He had evidently come in haste. He<br/>held out his hand to Kolya at once.<br/><br/>"Here you are at last! How anxious we've been to see you!"<br/><br/>"There were reasons which you shall know directly. Anyway, I am<br/>glad to make your acquaintance. I've long been hoping for an<br/>opportunity, and have heard a great deal about you," Kolya<br/>muttered, a little breathless.<br/><br/>"We should have met anyway. I've heard a great deal about you,<br/>too; but you've been a long time coming here."<br/><br/>"Tell me, how are things going?"<br/>
