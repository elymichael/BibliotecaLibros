"Ah, that's true! I understand that perfectly now. Ah, Alyosha,<br/>how do you know all this? So young and yet he knows what's in the<br/>heart… . I should never have worked it out."<br/><br/>"The great thing now is to persuade him that he is on an equal<br/>footing with us, in spite of his taking money from us," Alyosha<br/>went on in his excitement, "and not only on an equal, but even on a<br/>higher footing."<br/><br/>"'On a higher footing' is charming, Alexey Fyodorovitch; but go<br/>on, go on!"<br/><br/>"You mean there isn't such an expression as 'on a higher<br/>footing'; but that doesn't matter because- "<br/><br/>"Oh, no, of course it doesn't matter. Forgive me, Alyosha, dear…<br/>. You know, I scarcely respected you till now- that is I respected<br/>you but on an equal footing; but now I shall begin to respect you<br/>on a higher footing. Don't be angry, dear, at my joking," she put<br/>in at once, with strong feeling. "I am absurd and small, but you,<br/>you! Listen, Alexey Fyodorovitch. Isn't there in all our analysis-<br/>I mean your analysis… no, better call it ours- aren't we showing<br/>contempt for him, for that poor man- in analysing his soul like<br/>this, as it were, from above, eh? In deciding so certainly that he<br/>will take the money?"<br/><br/>"No, Lise, it's not contempt," Alyosha answered, as though he<br/>had prepared himself for the question. "I was thinking of that on<br/>the way here. How can it be contempt when we are all like him, when<br/>we are all just the same as he is? For you know we are just the<br/>same, no better. If we are better, we should have been just the<br/>same in his place… . I don't know about you, Lise, but I consider<br/>that I have a sordid soul in many ways, and his soul is not sordid;<br/>on the contrary, full of fine feeling… . No, Lise, I have no<br/>contempt for him. Do you know, Lise, my elder told me once to care<br/>for most people exactly as one would for children, and for some of<br/>them as one would for the sick in hospitals."<br/><br/>"Ah, Alexey Fyodorovitch. dear, let us care for people as we<br/>would for the sick!"<br/><br/>"Let us, Lise; I am ready. Though I am not altogether ready in<br/>myself. I am sometimes very impatient and at other times I don't<br/>see things. It's different with you."<br/><br/>"Ah, I don't believe it! Alexey Fyodorovitch, how happy I<br/>am!"<br/><br/>"I am so glad you say so, Lise."<br/><br/>"Alexey Fyodorovitch, you are wonderfully good, but you are<br/>sometimes sort of formal… . And yet you are not a bit formal<br/>really. Go to the door, open it gently, and see whether mamma is<br/>listening," said Lise, in a nervous, hurried whisper.<br/>
