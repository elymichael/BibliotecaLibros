"Confront him with it."

"Do you recognise this object?"

Nikolay Parfenovitch laid upon the table a large and thick
official envelope, on which three seals still remained intact. The
envelope was empty, and slit open at one end. Mitya stared at it
with open eyes.

"It… it must be that envelope of my father's, the envelope that
contained the three thousand roubles… and if there's inscribed on
it, allow me, 'For my little chicken'… yes- three thousand!" he
shouted, "do you see, three thousand, do you see?"

"Of course, we see. But we didn't find the money in it. It was
empty, and lying on the floor by the bed, behind the screen."

For some seconds Mitya stood as though thunderstruck.

"Gentlemen, it's Smerdyakov!" he shouted suddenly, at the top of
his voice. "It's he who's murdered him! He's robbed him! No one
else knew where the old man hid the envelope. It's Smerdyakov,
that's clear, now!"

"But you, too, knew of the envelope and that it was under the
pillow."

"I never knew it. I've never seen it. This is the first time
I've looked at it. I'd only heard of it from Smerdyakov… . He was
the only one who knew where the old man kept it hidden, I didn't
know… " Mitya was completely breathless.

"But you told us yourself that the envelope was under your
deceased father's pillow. You especially stated that it was under
the pillow, so you must have known it."

"We've got it written down," confirmed Nikolay Parfenovitch.
