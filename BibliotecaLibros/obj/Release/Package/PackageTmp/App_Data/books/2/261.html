"How can I thank you, Kuzma Kuzmitch?" cried Mitya<br/>effusively.<br/><br/>"Don't mention it," said Samsonov, inclining his head.<br/><br/>"But you don't know, you've saved me. Oh, it was a true<br/>presentiment brought me to you… . So now to this priest!<br/><br/>"No need of thanks."<br/><br/>"I'll make haste and fly there. I'm afraid I've overtaxed your<br/>strength. I shall never forget it. It's a Russian says that, Kuzma<br/>Kuzmitch, a R-r-russian!"<br/><br/>"To be sure!" Mitya seized his hand to press it, but there was a<br/>malignant gleam in the old man's eye. Mitya drew back his hand, but<br/>at once blamed himself for his mistrustfulness. "It's because he's<br/>tired," he thought.<br/><br/>"For her sake! For her sake, Kuzma Kuzmitch! You understand that<br/>it's for her," he cried, his voice ringing through the room. He<br/>bowed, turned sharply round, and with the same long stride walked<br/>to the door without looking back. He was trembling with<br/>delight.<br/><br/>"Everything was on the verge of ruin and my guardian angel saved<br/>me," was the thought in his mind. And if such a business man as<br/>Samsonov (a most worthy old man, and what dignity!) had suggested<br/>this course, then… then success was assured. He would fly off<br/>immediately. "I will be back before night, I shall be back at night<br/>and the thing is done. Could the old man have been laughing at me?"<br/>exclaimed Mitya, as he strode towards his lodging. He could, of<br/>course, imagine nothing but that the advice was practical "from<br/>such a business man" with an understanding of the business, with an<br/>understanding of this Lyagavy (curious surname!). Or- the old man<br/>was laughing at him.<br/><br/>Alas! The second alternative was the correct one. Long<br/>afterwards, when the catastrophe had happened, old Samsonov himself<br/>confessed, laughing, that he had made a fool of the "captain." He<br/>was a cold, spiteful and sarcastic man, liable to violent<br/>antipathies. Whether it was the "captain's" excited face, or the<br/>foolish conviction of the "rake and spendthrift," that he,<br/>Samsonov, could be taken in by such a cock-and-bull story as his<br/>scheme, or his jealousy of Grushenka, in whose name this<br/>"scapegrace" had rushed in on him with such a tale to get money<br/>which worked on the old man, I can't tell. But at the instant when<br/>Mitya stood before him, feeling his legs grow weak under him, and<br/>frantically exclaiming that he was ruined, at that moment the old<br/>man looked at him with intense spite, and resolved to make a<br/>laughing-stock of him. When Mitya had gone, Kuzma Kuzmitch, white<br/>with rage, turned to his son and bade him see to it that that<br/>beggar be never seen again, and never admitted even into the yard,<br/>or else he'd-<br/><br/>He did not utter his threat. But even his son, who often saw him<br/>enraged, trembled with fear. For a whole hour afterwards, the old<br/>man was shaking with anger, and by evening he was worse, and sent<br/>for the doctor.<br/><br/><br/>
