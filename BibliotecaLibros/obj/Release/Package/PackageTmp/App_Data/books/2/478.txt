"Then he despises me, me?"

"You, too."

"Good." Lise seemed to grind her teeth. "When he went out
laughing, I felt that it was nice to be despised. The child with
fingers cut off is nice, and to be despised is niceâ€¦ "

And she laughed in Alyosha's face, a feverish malicious
laugh.

"Do you know, Alyosha, do you know, I should like- Alyosha, save
me!" She suddenly jumped from the couch, rushed to him and seized
him with both hands. "Save me!" she almost groaned. "Is there
anyone in the world I could tell what I've told you? I've told you
the truth, the truth. I shall kill myself, because I loathe
everything! I don't want to live, because I loathe everything! I
loathe everything, everything. Alyosha, why don't you love me in
the least?" she finished in a frenzy.

"But I do love you!" answered Alyosha warmly.

"And will you weep over me, will you?"

"Yes."

"Not because I won't be your wife, but simply weep for me?"

"Yes."

"Thank you! It's only your tears I want. Everyone else may
punish me and trample me under foot, everyone, everyone, not
excepting anyone. For I don't love anyone. Do you hear, not anyone!
On the contrary, I hate him! Go, Alyosha; it's time you went to
your brother"; she tore herself away from him suddenly.
