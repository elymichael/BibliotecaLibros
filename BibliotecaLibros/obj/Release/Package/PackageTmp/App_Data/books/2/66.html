<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>2<br/>Lizaveta<br/><br/><br/>THERE was one circumstance which struck Grigory particularly,<br/>and confirmed a very unpleasant and revolting suspicion. This<br/>Lizaveta was a dwarfish creature, "not five foot within a wee bit,"<br/>as many of the pious old women said pathetically about her, after<br/>her death. Her broad, healthy, red face had a look of blank idiocy<br/>and the fixed stare in her eyes was unpleasant, in spite of their<br/>meek expression. She wandered about, summer and winter alike,<br/>barefooted, wearing nothing but a hempen smock. Her coarse, almost<br/>black hair curled like lamb's wool, and formed a sort of huge cap<br/>on her head. It was always crusted with mud, and had leaves; bits<br/>of stick, and shavings clinging to it, as she always slept on the<br/>ground and in the dirt. Her father, a homeless, sickly drunkard,<br/>called Ilya, had lost everything and lived many years as a workman<br/>with some well-to-do tradespeople. Her mother had long been dead.<br/>Spiteful and diseased, Ilya used to beat Lizaveta inhumanly<br/>whenever she returned to him. But she rarely did so, for everyone<br/>in the town was ready to look after her as being an idiot, and so<br/>specially dear to God. Ilya's employers, and many others in the<br/>town, especially of the tradespeople, tried to clothe her better,<br/>and always rigged her out with high boots and sheepskin coat for<br/>the winter. But, although she allowed them to dress her up without<br/>resisting, she usually went away, preferably to the cathedral<br/>porch, and taking off all that had been given her- kerchief,<br/>sheepskin, skirt or boots- she left them there and walked away<br/>barefoot in her smock as before. It happened on one occasion that a<br/>new governor of the province, making a tour of inspection in our<br/>town, saw Lizaveta, and was wounded in his tenderest<br/>susceptibilities. And though he was told she was an idiot, he<br/>pronounced that for a young woman of twenty to wander about in<br/>nothing but a smock was a breach of the proprieties, and must not<br/>occur again. But the governor went his way, and Lizaveta was left<br/>as she was. At last her father died, which made her even more<br/>acceptable in the eyes of the religious persons of the town, as an<br/>orphan. In fact, everyone seemed to like her; even the boys did not<br/>tease her, and the boys of our town, especially the schoolboys, are<br/>a mischievous set. She would walk into strange houses, and no one<br/>drove her away. Everyone was kind to her and gave her something. If<br/>she were given a copper, she would take it, and at once drop it in<br/>the alms-jug of the church or prison. If she were given a roll or<br/>bun in the market, she would hand it to the first child she met.<br/>Sometimes she would stop one of the richest ladies in the town and<br/>give it to her, and the lady would be pleased to take it. She<br/>herself never tasted anything but black bread and water. If she<br/>went into an expensive shop, where there were costly goods or money<br/>lying about, no one kept watch on her, for they knew that if she<br/>saw thousands of roubles overlooked by them, she would not have<br/>touched a farthing. She scarcely ever went to church. She slept<br/>either in the church porch or climbed over a hurdle (there are many<br/>hurdles instead of fences to this day in our town) into a kitchen<br/>garden. She used at least once a week to turn up "at home," that is<br/>at the house of her father's former employers, and in the winter<br/>went there every night, and slept either in the passage or the<br/>cow-house. People were amazed that she could stand such a life, but<br/>she was accustomed to it, and, although she was so tiny, she was of<br/>a robust constitution. Some of the townspeople declared that she<br/>did all this only from pride, but that is hardly credible. She<br/>could hardly speak, and only from time to time uttered an<br/>inarticulate grunt. How could she have been proud?<br/><br/>It happened one clear, warm, moonlight night in September (many<br/>years ago) five or six drunken revellers were returning from the<br/>club at a very late hour, according to our provincial notions. They<br/>passed through the "backway," which led between the back gardens of<br/>the houses, with hurdles on either side. This way leads out on to<br/>the bridge over the long, stinking pool which we were accustomed to<br/>call a river. Among the nettles and burdocks under the hurdle our<br/>revellers saw Lizaveta asleep. They stopped to look at her,<br/>laughing, and began jesting with unbridled licentiousness. It<br/>occurred to one young gentleman to make the whimsical inquiry<br/>whether anyone could possibly look upon such an animal as a woman,<br/>and so forth… . They all pronounced with lofty repugnance that it<br/>was impossible. But Fyodor Pavlovitch, who was among them, sprang<br/>forward and declared that it was by no means impossible, and that,<br/>indeed, there was a certain piquancy about it, and so on… . It is<br/>true that at that time he was overdoing his part as a buffoon. He<br/>liked to put himself forward and entertain the company, ostensibly<br/>on equal terms, of course, though in reality he was on a servile<br/>footing with them. It was just at the time when he had received the<br/>news of his first wife's death in Petersburg, and, with crape upon<br/>his hat, was drinking and behaving so shamelessly that even the<br/>most reckless among us were shocked at the sight of him. The<br/>revellers, of course, laughed at this unexpected opinion; and one<br/>of them even began challenging him to act upon it. The others<br/>repelled the idea even more emphatically, although still with the<br/>utmost hilarity, and at last they went on their way. Later on,<br/>Fyodor Pavlovitch swore that he had gone with them, and perhaps it<br/>was so, no one knows for certain, and no one ever knew. But five or<br/>six months later, all the town was talking, with intense and<br/>sincere indignation, of Lizaveta's condition, and trying to find<br/>out who was the miscreant who had wronged her. Then suddenly a<br/>terrible rumour was all over the town that this miscreant was no<br/>other than Fyodor Pavlovitch. Who set the rumour going? Of that<br/>drunken band five had left the town and the only one still among us<br/>was an elderly and much respected civil councillor, the father of<br/>grown-up daughters, who could hardly have spread the tale, even if<br/>there had been any foundation for it. But rumour pointed straight<br/>at Fyodor Pavlovitch, and persisted in pointing at him. Of course<br/>this was no great grievance to him: he would not have troubled to<br/>contradict a set of tradespeople. In those days he was proud, and<br/>did not condescend to talk except in his own circle of the<br/>officials and nobles, whom he entertained so well.<br/><br/>At the time, Grigory stood up for his master vigorously. He<br/>provoked quarrels and altercations in defence of him and succeeded<br/>in bringing some people round to his side. "It's the wench's own<br/>fault," he asserted, and the culprit was Karp, a dangerous convict,<br/>who had escaped from prison and whose name was well known to us, as<br/>he had hidden in our town. This conjecture sounded plausible, for<br/>it was remembered that Karp had been in the neighbourhood just at<br/>that time in the autumn, and had robbed three people. But this<br/>affair and all the talk about it did not estrange popular sympathy<br/>from the poor idiot. She was better looked after than ever. A<br/>well-to-do merchants's widow named Kondratyev arranged to take her<br/>into her house at the end of April, meaning not to let her go out<br/>until after the confinement. They kept a constant watch over her,<br/>but in spite of their vigilance she escaped on the very last day,<br/>and made her way into Fyodor Pavlovitch's garden. How, in her<br/>condition, she managed to climb over the high, strong fence<br/>remained a mystery. Some maintained that she must have been lifted<br/>over by somebody; others hinted at something more uncanny. The most<br/>likely explanation is that it happened naturally- that Lizaveta,<br/>accustomed to clambering over hurdles to sleep in gardens, had<br/>somehow managed to climb this fence, in spite of her condition, and<br/>had leapt down, injuring herself.<br/><br/>Grigory rushed to Marfa and sent her to Lizaveta, while he ran<br/>to fetch an old midwife who lived close by. They saved the baby,<br/>but Lizaveta died at dawn. Grigory took the baby, brought it home,<br/>and making his wife sit down, put it on her lap. "A child of God-<br/>an orphan is akin to all," he said, "and to us above others. Our<br/>little lost one has sent us this, who has come from the devil's son<br/>and a holy innocent. Nurse him and weep no more."<br/><br/>So Marfa brought up the child. He was christened Pavel, to which<br/>people were not slow in adding Fyodorovitch (son of Fyodor). Fyodor<br/>Pavlovitch did not object to any of this, and thought it amusing,<br/>though he persisted vigorously in denying his responsibility. The<br/>townspeople were pleased at his adopting the foundling. Later on,<br/>Fyodor Pavlovitch invented a surname for the child, calling him<br/>Smerdyakov, after his mother's nickname.<br/><br/>So this Smerdyakov became Fyodor Pavlovitch's second servant,<br/>and was living in the lodge with Grigory and Marfa at the time our<br/>story begins. He was employed as cook. I ought to say something of<br/>this Smerdyakov, but I am ashamed of keeping my readers' attention<br/>so long occupied with these common menials, and I will go back to<br/>my story, hoping to say more of Smerdyakov in the course of it.<br/><br/><br/>
