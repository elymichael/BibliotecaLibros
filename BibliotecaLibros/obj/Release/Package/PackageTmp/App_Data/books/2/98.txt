"Serve him right!" shouted Dmitri breathlessly. "If I haven't
killed him, I'll come again and kill him. You can't protect
him!"

"Dmitri! Go away at once!" cried Alyosha commandingly.

"Alexey! You tell me. It's only you I can believe; was she here
just now, or not? I saw her myself creeping this way by the fence
from the lane. I shouted, she ran away."

"I swear she's not been here, and no one expected her."

"But I saw her… . So she must… I'll find out at once where she
is… . Good-bye, Alexey! Not a word to Aesop about the money now.
But go to Katerina Ivanovna at once and be sure to say, 'He sends
his compliments to you!' Compliments, his compliments! just
compliments and farewell! Describe the scene to her."

Meanwhile Ivan and Grigory had raised the old man and seated him
in an arm-chair. His face was covered with blood, but he was
conscious and listened greedily to Dmitri's cries. He was still
fancying that Grushenka really was somewhere in the house. Dmitri
looked at him with hatred as he went out.

"I don't repent shedding your blood!" he cried. "Beware, old
man, beware of your dream, for I have my dream, too. I curse you,
and disown you altogether."

He ran out of the room.

"She's here. She must be here. Smerdyakov! Smerdyakov!" the old
man wheezed, scarcely audibly, beckoning to him with his
finger.

"No, she's not here, you old lunatic!" Ivan shouted at him
angrily. "Here, he's fainting? Water! A towel! Make haste,
Smerdyakov!"

Smerdyakov ran for water. At last they got the old man
undressed, and put him to bed. They wrapped a wet towel round his
head. Exhausted by the brandy, by his violent emotion, and the
blows he had received, he shut his eyes and fell asleep as soon as
his head touched the pillow. Ivan and Alyosha went back to the
drawing-room. Smerdyakov removed the fragments of the broken vase,
while Grigory stood by the table looking gloomily at the floor.
