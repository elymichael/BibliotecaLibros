"Do you want me to bow down to you, monk?" said Father Ferapont.<br/>"Get up!"<br/><br/>The monk got up.<br/><br/>"Blessing, be blessed! Sit beside me. Where have you come<br/>from?"<br/><br/>What most struck the poor monk was the fact that in spite of his<br/>strict fasting and great age, Father Ferapont still looked a<br/>vigorous old man. He was tall, held himself erect, and had a thin,<br/>but fresh and healthy face. There was no doubt he still had<br/>considerable strength. He was of athletic build. In spite of his<br/>great age he was not even quite grey, and still had very thick hair<br/>and a full beard, both of which had once been black. His eyes were<br/>grey, large and luminous, but strikingly prominent. He spoke with a<br/>broad accent. He was dressed in a peasant's long reddish coat of<br/>coarse convict cloth (as it used to be called) and had a stout rope<br/>round his waist. His throat and chest were bare. Beneath his coat,<br/>his shirt of the coarsest linen showed almost black with dirt, not<br/>having been changed for months. They said that he wore irons<br/>weighing thirty pounds under his coat. His stockingless feet were<br/>thrust in old slippers almost dropping to pieces.<br/><br/>"From the little Obdorsk monastery, from St. Sylvester," the<br/>monk answered humbly, whilst his keen and inquisitive, but rather<br/>frightened little eyes kept watch on the hermit.<br/><br/>"I have been at your Sylvester's. I used to stay there. Is<br/>Sylvester well?"<br/><br/>The monk hesitated.<br/><br/>"You are a senseless lot! How do you keep the fasts?"<br/><br/>"Our dietary is according to the ancient conventual rules.<br/>During Lent there are no meals provided for Monday, Wednesday, and<br/>Friday. For Tuesday and Thursday we have white bread, stewed fruit<br/>with honey, wild berries, or salt cabbage and whole meal stirabout.<br/>On Saturday white cabbage soup, noodles with peas, kasha, all with<br/>hemp oil. On weekdays we have dried fish and kasha with the cabbage<br/>soup. From Monday till Saturday evening, six whole days in Holy<br/>Week, nothing is cooked, and we have only bread and water, and that<br/>sparingly; if possible not taking food every day, just the same as<br/>is ordered for first week in Lent. On Good Friday nothing is eaten.<br/>In the same way on the Saturday we have to fast till three o'clock,<br/>and then take a little bread and water and drink a single cup of<br/>wine. On Holy Thursday we drink wine and have something cooked<br/>without oil or not cooked at all, inasmuch as the Laodicean council<br/>lays down for Holy Thursday: "It is unseemly by remitting the fast<br/>on the Holy Thursday to dishonour the whole of Lent!" This is how<br/>we keep the fast. But what is that compared with you, holy Father,"<br/>added the monk, growing more confident, "for all the year round,<br/>even at Easter, you take nothing but bread and water, and what we<br/>should eat in two days lasts you full seven. It's truly marvellous-<br/>your great abstinence."<br/><br/>"And mushrooms?" asked Father Ferapont, suddenly.<br/><br/>"Mushrooms?" repeated the surprised monk.<br/>
