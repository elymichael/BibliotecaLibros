The Third Ordeal


THOUGH Mitya spoke sullenly, it was evident that he was trying
more than ever not to forget or miss a single detail of his story.
He told them how he had leapt over the fence into his father's
garden; how he had gone up to the window; told them all that had
passed under the window. Clearly, precisely, distinctly, he
described the feelings that troubled him during those moments in
the garden when he longed so terribly to know whether Grushenka was
with his father or not. But, strange to say, both the lawyers
listened now with a sort of awful reserve, looked coldly at him,
asked few questions. Mitya could gather nothing from their
faces.

"They're angry and offended," he thought. "Well, bother
them!"

When he described how he made up his mind at last to make the
"signal" to his father that Grushenka had come, so that he should
open the window, the lawyers paid no attention to the word
"signal," as though they entirely failed to grasp the meaning of
the word in this connection: so much so, that Mitya noticed it.
Coming at last to the moment when, seeing his father peering out of
the window, his hatred flared up and he pulled the pestle out of
his pocket, he suddenly, as though of design, stopped short. He sat
gazing at the wall and was aware that their eyes were fixed upon
him.

"Well?" said the investigating lawyer. "You pulled out the
weapon and… and what happened then?

"Then? Why, then I murdered him… hit him on the head and cracked
his skull… . I suppose that's your story. That's it!"

His eyes suddenly flashed. All his smothered wrath suddenly
flamed up with extraordinary violence in his soul.

"Our story?" repeated Nikolay Parfenovitch.
