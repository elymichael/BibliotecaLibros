You frightened me, Rakitin, that's what it is." Grushenka turned<br/>with a smile to Alyosha. "Don't be afraid of me, my dear Alyosha,<br/>you cannot think how glad I am to see you, my unexpected visitor.<br/>But you frightened me, Rakitin, I thought it was Mitya breaking in.<br/>You see, I deceived him just now, I made him promise to believe me<br/>and I told him a lie. I told him that I was going to spend the<br/>evening with my old man, Kuzma Kuzmitch, and should be there till<br/>late counting up his money. I always spend one whole evening a week<br/>with him making up his accounts. We lock ourselves in and he counts<br/>on the reckoning beads while I sit and put things down in the book.<br/>I am the only person he trusts. Mitya believes that I am there, but<br/>I came back and have been sitting locked in here, expecting some<br/>news. How was it Fenya let you in? Fenya, Fenya, run out to the<br/>gate, open it and look about whether the captain is to be seen!<br/>Perhaps he is hiding and spying, I am dreadfully frightened."<br/><br/>There's no one there, Agrafena Alexandrovna, I've just looked<br/>out; I keep running to peep through the crack; I am in fear and<br/>trembling myself."<br/><br/>"Are the shutters fastened, Fenya? And we must draw the<br/>curtains- that's better!" She drew the heavy curtains herself.<br/>"He'd rush in at once if he saw a light. I am afraid of your<br/>brother Mitya to-day, Alyosha."<br/><br/>Grushenka spoke aloud, and, though she was alarmed, she seemed<br/>very happy about something.<br/><br/>"Why are you so afraid of Mitya to-day?" inquired Rakitin. "I<br/>should have thought you were not timid with him, you'd twist him<br/>round your little finger."<br/><br/>"I tell you, I am expecting news, priceless news, so I don't<br/>want Mitya at all. And he didn't believe, I feel he didn't, that I<br/>should stay at Kuzma Kuzmitch's. He must be in his ambush now,<br/>behind Fyodor Pavlovitch's, in the garden, watching for me. And if<br/>he's there, he won't come here, so much the better! But I really<br/>have been to Kuzma Kuzmitch's, Mitya escorted me there. I told him<br/>I should stay there till midnight, and I asked him to be sure to<br/>come at midnight to fetch me home. He went away and I sat ten<br/>minutes with Kuzma Kuzmitch and came back here again. Ugh, I was<br/>afraid, I ran for fear of meeting him."<br/><br/>"And why are you so dressed up? What a curious cap you've got<br/>on!"<br/><br/>"How curious you are yourself, Rakitin! I tell you, I am<br/>expecting a message. If the message comes, I shall fly, I shall<br/>gallop away and you will see no more of me. That's why I am dressed<br/>up, so as to be ready."<br/><br/>"And where are you flying to?"<br/><br/>"If you know too much, you'll get old too soon."<br/><br/>"Upon my word! You are highly delightedâ€¦ I've never seen you<br/>like this before. You are dressed up as if you were going to a<br/>ball." Rakitin looked her up and down.<br/>
