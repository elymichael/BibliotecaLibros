Alyosha did not speak. He sat afraid to move, he heard her<br/>words, "If you tell me, I'll get off," but he did not answer. But<br/>there was nothing in his heart such as Rakitin, for instance,<br/>watching him malignantly from his corner, might have expected or<br/>fancied. The great grief in his heart swallowed up every sensation<br/>that might have been aroused, and, if only he could have thought<br/>clearly at that moment, he would have realised that he had now the<br/>strongest armour to protect him from every lust and temptation. Yet<br/>in spite of the vague irresponsiveness of his spiritual condition<br/>and the sorrow that overwhelmed him, he could not help wondering at<br/>a new and strange sensation in his heart. This woman, this<br/>"dreadful" woman, had no terror for him now, none of that terror<br/>that had stirred in his soul at any passing thought of woman. On<br/>the contrary, this woman, dreaded above all women, sitting now on<br/>his knee, holding him in her arms, aroused in him now a quite<br/>different, unexpected, peculiar feeling, a feeling of the intensest<br/>and purest interest without a trace of fear, of his former terror.<br/>That was what instinctively surprised him.<br/><br/>"You've talked nonsense enough," cried Rakitin, "you'd much<br/>better give us some champagne. You owe it me, you know you do!"<br/><br/>"Yes, I really do. Do you know, Alyosha, I promised him<br/>champagne on the top of everything, if he'd bring you? I'll have<br/>some too! Fenya, Fenya, bring us the bottle Mitya left! Look sharp!<br/>Though I am so stingy, I'll stand a bottle, not for you, Rakitin,<br/>you're a toadstool, but he is a falcon! And though my heart is full<br/>of something very different, so be it, I'll drink with you. I long<br/>for some dissipation."<br/><br/>"But what is the matter with you? And what is this message, may<br/>I ask, or is it a secret?" Rakitin put in inquisitively, doing his<br/>best to pretend not to notice the snubs that were being continually<br/>aimed at him.<br/><br/>"Ech, it's not a secret, and you know it, too," Grushenka said,<br/>in a voice suddenly anxious, turning her head towards Rakitin, and<br/>drawing a little away from Alyosha, though she still sat on his<br/>knee with her arm round his neck. "My officer is coming, Rakitin,<br/>my officer is coming."<br/><br/>"I heard he was coming, but is he so near?"<br/><br/>"He is at Mokroe now; he'll send a messenger from there, so he<br/>wrote; I got a letter from him to-day. I am expecting the messenger<br/>every minute."<br/><br/>"You don't say so! Why at Mokroe?"<br/><br/>"That's a long story, I've told you enough."<br/><br/>"Mitya'll be up to something now- I say! Does he know or doesn't<br/>he?"<br/><br/>"He know! Of course he doesn't. If he knew, there would be<br/>murder. But I am not afraid of that now, I am not afraid of his<br/>knife. Be quiet, Rakitin, don't remind me of Dmitri Fyodorovitch,<br/>he has bruised my heart. And I don't want to think of that at this<br/>moment. I can think of Alyosha here, I can look at Alyosha… smile<br/>at me, dear, cheer up, smile at my foolishness, at my pleasure… .<br/>Ah, he's smiling, he's smiling! How kindly he looks at me! And you<br/>know, Alyosha, I've been thinking all this time you were angry with<br/>me, because of the day before yesterday, because of that young<br/>lady. I was a cur, that's the truth… . But it's a good thing it<br/>happened so. It was a horrid thing, but a good thing too."<br/>Grushenka smiled dreamily and a little cruel line showed in her<br/>smile. "Mitya told me that she screamed out that I 'ought to be<br/>flogged.' I did insult her dreadfully. She sent for me, she wanted<br/>to make a conquest of me, to win me over with her chocolate… . No,<br/>it's a good thing it did end like that." She smiled again. "But I<br/>am still afraid of your being angry."<br/>
