When the servants came in to him he would say continually,
"Dear, kind people, why are you doing so much for me, do I deserve
to be waited on? If it were God's will for me to live, I would wait
on you, for all men should wait on one another."

Mother shook her head as she listened. "My darling, it's your
illness makes you talk like that."

"Mother darling," he would say, "there must be servants and
masters, but if so I will be the servant of my servants, the same
as they are to me. And another thing, mother, every one of us has
sinned against all men, and I more than any."

Mother positively smiled at that, smiled through her tears.
"Why, how could you have sinned against all men, more than all?
Robbers and murderers have done that, but what sin have you
committed yet, that you hold yourself more guilty than all?"

"Mother, little heart of mine," he said (he had begun using such
strange caressing words at that time), "little heart of mine, my
joy, believe me, everyone is really responsible to all men for all
men and for everything. I don't know how to explain it to you, but
I feel it is so, painfully even. And how is it we went on then
living, getting angry and not knowing?"

So he would get up every day, more and more sweet and joyous and
full of love. When the doctor, an old German called Eisenschmidt,
came:

"Well, doctor, have I another day in this world?" he would ask,
joking.

"You'll live many days yet," the doctor would answer, "and
months and years too."

"Months and years!" he would exclaim. "Why reckon the days? One
day is enough for a man to know all happiness. My dear ones, why do
we quarrel, try to outshine each other and keep grudges against
each other? Let's go straight into the garden, walk and play there,
love, appreciate, and kiss each other, and glorify life."

"Your son cannot last long," the doctor told my mother, as she
accompanied him the door. "The disease is affecting his brain."
