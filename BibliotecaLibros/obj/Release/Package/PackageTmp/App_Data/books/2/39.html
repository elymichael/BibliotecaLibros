<br/>"We are discussing this gentleman's most interesting article,"<br/>said Father Iosif, the librarian, addressing the elder, and<br/>indicating Ivan. "He brings forward much that is new, but I think<br/>the argument cuts both ways. It is an article written in answer to<br/>a book by an ecclesiastical authority on the question of the<br/>ecclesiastical court, and the scope of its jurisdiction."<br/><br/>"I'm sorry I have not read your article, but I've heard of it,"<br/>said the elder, looking keenly and intently at Ivan.<br/><br/>"He takes up a most interesting position," continued the Father<br/>Librarian. "As far as Church jurisdiction is concerned he is<br/>apparently quite opposed to the separation of Church from<br/>State."<br/><br/>"That's interesting. But in what sense?" Father Zossima asked<br/>Ivan.<br/><br/>The latter, at last, answered him, not condescendingly, as<br/>Alyosha had feared, but with modesty and reserve, with evident<br/>goodwill and apparently without the slightest arrierepensee<br/><br/>"I start from the position that this confusion of elements, that<br/>is, of the essential principles of Church and State, will, of<br/>course, go on for ever, in spite of the fact that it is impossible<br/>for them to mingle, and that the confusion of these elements cannot<br/>lead to any consistent or even normal results, for there is falsity<br/>at the very foundation of it. Compromise between the Church and<br/>State in such questions as, for instance, jurisdiction, is, to my<br/>thinking, impossible in any real sense. My clerical opponent<br/>maintains that the Church holds a precise and defined position in<br/>the State. I maintain, on the contrary, that the Church ought to<br/>include the whole State, and not simply to occupy a corner in it,<br/>and, if this is, for some reason, impossible at present, then it<br/>ought, in reality, to be set up as the direct and chief aim of the<br/>future development of Christian society!"<br/><br/>"Perfectly true," Father Paissy, the silent and learned monk,<br/>assented with fervour and decision.<br/><br/>"The purest Ultramontanism!" cried Miusov impatiently, crossing<br/>and recrossing his legs.<br/><br/>"Oh, well, we have no mountains," cried Father Iosif, and<br/>turning to the elder he continued: "Observe the answer he makes to<br/>the following 'fundamental and essential' propositions of his<br/>opponent, who is, you must note, an ecclesiastic. First, that 'no<br/>social organisation can or ought to arrogate to itself power to<br/>dispose of the civic and political rights of its members.'<br/>Secondly, that 'criminal and civil jurisdiction ought not to belong<br/>to the Church, and is inconsistent with its nature, both as a<br/>divine institution and as an organisation of men for religious<br/>objects,' and, finally, in the third place, 'the Church is a<br/>kingdom not of this world.'<br/><br/>"A most unworthy play upon words for an ecclesiastic!" Father<br/>Paissy could not refrain from breaking in again. "I have read the<br/>book which you have answered," he added, addressing Ivan, "and was<br/>astounded at the words 'The Church is a kingdom not of this world.<br/>'If it is not of this world, then it cannot exist on earth at all.<br/>In the Gospel, the words 'not of this world' are not used in that<br/>sense. To play with such words is indefensible. Our Lord Jesus<br/>Christ came to set up the Church upon earth. The Kingdom of Heaven,<br/>of course, is not of this world, but in Heaven; but it is only<br/>entered through the Church which has been founded and established<br/>upon earth. And so a frivolous play upon words in such a connection<br/>is unpardonable and improper. The Church is, in truth, a kingdom<br/>and ordained to rule, and in the end must undoubtedly become the<br/>kingdom ruling over all the earth. For that we have the divine<br/>promise."<br/><br/>
