<br/>"Why does he come here so often? Surely you are not such great<br/>friends?" asked Alyosha. He, too, nodded at the door through which<br/>Rakitin had disappeared.<br/><br/>"Great friends with Rakitin? No, not as much as that. Is it<br/>likely- a pig like that? He considers I am… a blackguard. They<br/>can't understand a joke either, that's the worst of such people.<br/>They never understand a joke, and their souls are dry, dry and<br/>flat; they remind me of prison walls when I was first brought here.<br/>But he is a clever fellow, very clever. Well, Alexey, it's all over<br/>with me now."<br/><br/>He sat down on the bench and made Alyosha sit down beside<br/>him.<br/><br/>"Yes, the trial's to-morrow. Are you so hopeless, brother?"<br/>Alyosha said, with an apprehensive feeling.<br/><br/>"What are you talking about?" said Mitya, looking at him rather<br/>uncertainly. "Oh, you mean the trial! Damn it all! Till now we've<br/>been talking of things that don't matter, about this trial, but I<br/>haven't said a word to you about the chief thing. Yes, the trial is<br/>to-morrow; but it wasn't the trial I meant, when I said it was all<br/>over with me. Why do you look at me so critically?"<br/><br/>"What do you mean, Mitya?"<br/><br/>"Ideas, ideas, that's all! Ethics! What is ethics?"<br/><br/>"Ethics?" asked Alyosha, wondering.<br/><br/>"Yes; is it a science?"<br/><br/>"Yes, there is such a science… but… I confess I can't explain to<br/>you what sort of science it is."<br/><br/>
