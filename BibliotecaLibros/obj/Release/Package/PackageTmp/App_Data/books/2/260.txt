"Excuse me, we don't undertake such business."

Mitya suddenly felt his legs growing weak under him.

"What am I to do now, Kuzma Kuzmitch?" he muttered, with a pale
smile. "I suppose it's all up with me- what do you think?"

"Excuse meâ€¦ "

Mitya remained standing, staring motionless. He suddenly noticed
a movement in the old man's face. He started.

"You see, sir, business of that sort's not in our line," said
the old man slowly. "There's the court, and the lawyers- it's a
perfect misery. But if you like, there is a man here you might
apply to."

"Good heavens! Who is it? You're my salvation, Kuzma Kuzmitch,"
faltered Mitya.

"He doesn't live here, and he's not here just now. He is a
peasant, he does business in timber. His name is Lyagavy. He's been
haggling with Fyodor Pavlovitch for the last year, over your copse
at Tchermashnya. They can't agree on the price, maybe you've heard?
Now he's come back again and is staying with the priest at
Ilyinskoe, about twelve versts from the Volovya station. He wrote
to me, too, about the business of the copse, asking my advice.
Fyodor Pavlovitch means to go and see him himself. So if you were
to be beforehand with Fyodor Pavlovitch and to make Lyagavy the
offer you've made me, he might possibly- "

"A brilliant idea!" Mitya interrupted ecstatically. "He's the
very man, it would just suit him. He's haggling with him for it,
being asked too much, and here he would have all the documents
entitling him to the property itself. Ha ha ha!"

And Mitya suddenly went off into his short, wooden laugh,
startling Samsonov.
