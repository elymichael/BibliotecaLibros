"Yes, yes, for ever, for ever!" the boys cried in their ringing
voices, with softened faces.

"Let us remember his face and his clothes and his poor little
boots, his coffin and his unhappy, sinful father, and how boldly he
stood up for him alone against the whole school."

"We will remember, we will remember," cried the boys. "He was
brave, he was good!"

"Ah, how I loved him!" exclaimed Kolya.

"Ah, children, ah, dear friends, don't be afraid of life! How
good life is when one does something good and just!"

"Yes, yes," the boys repeated enthusiastically.

"Karamazov, we love you!" a voice, probably Kartashov's, cried
impulsively.

"We love you, we love you!" they all caught it up. There were
tears in the eyes of many of them.

"Hurrah for Karamazov!" Kolya shouted ecstatically.

"And may the dead boy's memory live for ever!" Alyosha added
again with feeling.

"For ever!" the boys chimed in again.
