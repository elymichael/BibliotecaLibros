A
Sudden Catastrophe


I MAY note that he had been called before Alyosha. But the usher
of the court announced to the President that, owing to an attack of
illness or some sort of fit, the witness could not appear at the
moment, but was ready to give his evidence as soon as he recovered.
But no one seemed to have heard it and it only came out later.

His entrance was for the first moment almost unnoticed. The
principal witnesses, especially the two rival ladies, had already
been questioned. Curiosity was satisfied for the time; the public
was feeling almost fatigued. Several more witnesses were still to
be heard, who probably had little information to give after all
that had been given. Time was passing. Ivan walked up with
extraordinary slowness, looking at no one, and with his head bowed,
as though plunged in gloomy thought. He was irreproachably dressed,
but his face made a painful impression, on me at least: there was
an earthy look in it, a look like a dying man's. His eyes were
lustreless; he raised them and looked slowly round the court.
Alyosha jumped up from his seat and moaned "Ah!" I remember that,
but it was hardly noticed.

The President began by informing him that he was a witness not
on oath, that he might answer or refuse to answer, but that, of
course, he must bear witness according to his conscience, and so
on, and so on. Ivan listened and looked at him blankly, but his
face gradually relaxed into a smile, and as soon as the President,
looking at him in astonishment, finished, he laughed outright.

"Well, and what else?" he asked in a loud voice.

There was a hush in the court; there was a feeling of something
strange. The President showed signs of uneasiness.

"Youâ€¦ are perhaps still unwell?" he began, looking everywhere
for the usher.

"Don't trouble yourself, your excellency, I am well enough and
can tell you something interesting," Ivan answered with sudden
calmness and respectfulness.
