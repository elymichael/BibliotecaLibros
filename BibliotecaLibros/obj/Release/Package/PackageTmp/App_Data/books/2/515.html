Ivan stepped up to the table, took up the roll of paper and<br/>began unfolding it, but suddenly drew back his fingers, as though<br/>from contact with a loathsome reptile.<br/><br/>"Your hands keep twitching," observed Smerdyakov, and he<br/>deliberately unfolded the bundle himself. Under the wrapper were<br/>three packets of hundred-rouble notes.<br/><br/>"They are all here, all the three thousand roubles; you need not<br/>count them. Take them," Smerdyakov suggested to Ivan, nodding at<br/>the notes. Ivan sank back in his chair. He was as white as a<br/>handkerchief.<br/><br/>"You frightened meâ€¦ with your stocking," he said, with a strange<br/>grin.<br/><br/>"Can you really not have known till now?" Smerdyakov asked once<br/>more.<br/><br/>"No, I did not know. I kept thinking of Dmitri. Brother,<br/>brother! Ach!" He suddenly clutched his head in both hands.<br/><br/>"Listen. Did you kill him alone? With my brother's help or<br/>without?"<br/><br/>"It was only with you, with your help, I killed him, and Dmitri<br/>Fyodorovitch is quite innocent."<br/><br/>"All right, all right. Talk about me later. Why do I keep on<br/>trembling? I can't speak properly."<br/><br/>"You were bold enough then. You said 'everything was lawful,'<br/>and how frightened you are now," Smerdyakov muttered in surprise.<br/>"Won't you have some lemonade? I'll ask for some at once. It's very<br/>refreshing. Only I must hide this first."<br/><br/>And again he motioned at the notes. He was just going to get up<br/>and call at the door to Marya Kondratyevna to make some lemonade<br/>and bring it them, but, looking for something to cover up the notes<br/>that she might not see them, he first took out his handkerchief,<br/>and as it turned out to be very dirty, took up the big yellow book<br/>that Ivan had noticed at first lying on the table, and put it over<br/>the notes. The book was The Sayings of the Holy Father Isaac the<br/>Syrian. Ivan read it mechanically.<br/>
