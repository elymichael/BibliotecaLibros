"Thank you,<br/>Smerdyakov; that's important. I'll go there at once."<br/><br/>"Don't betray me," Smerdyakov called after him.<br/><br/>"Oh, no, I'll go to the tavern as though by chance. Don't be<br/>anxious."<br/><br/>"But wait a minute, I'll open the gate to you," cried Marya<br/>Kondratyevna.<br/><br/>"No; it's a short cut, I'll get over the fence again."<br/><br/>What he had heard threw Alyosha into great agitation. He ran to<br/>the tavern. It was impossible for him to go into the tavern in his<br/>monastic dress, but he could inquire at the entrance for his<br/>brothers and call them down. But just as he reached the tavern, a<br/>window was flung open, and his brother Ivan called down to him from<br/>it.<br/><br/>"Alyosha, can't you come up here to me? I shall be awfully<br/>grateful."<br/><br/>
