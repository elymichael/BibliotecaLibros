<br/>"I'll explain the rest now, in two words. In Moscow their<br/>fortunes changed with the swiftness of lightning and the<br/>unexpectedness of an Arabian fairy-tale. That general's widow,<br/>their nearest relation, suddenly lost the two nieces who were her<br/>heiresses and next-of-kin- both died in the same week of small-pox.<br/>The old lady, prostrated with grief, welcomed Katya as a daughter,<br/>as her one hope, clutched at her, altered her will in Katya's<br/>favour. But that concerned the future. Meanwhile she gave her, for<br/>present use, eighty thousand roubles, as a marriage portion, to do<br/>what she liked with. She was an hysterical woman. I saw something<br/>of her in Moscow, later.<br/><br/>"Well, suddenly I received by post four thousand five hundred<br/>roubles. I was speechless with surprise, as you may suppose. Three<br/>days later came the promised letter. I have it with me now. You<br/>must read it. She offers to be my wife, offers herself to me. 'I<br/>love you madly, she says, 'even if you don't love me, never mind.<br/>Be my husband. Don't be afraid. I won't hamper you in any way. I<br/>will be your chattel. I will be the carpet under your feet. I want<br/>to love you for ever. I want to save you from yourself.' Alyosha, I<br/>am not worthy to repeat those lines in my vulgar words and in my<br/>vulgar tone, my everlastingly vulgar tone, that I can never cure<br/>myself of. That letter stabs me even now. Do you think I don't<br/>mind- that I don't mind still? I wrote her an answer at once, as it<br/>was impossible for me to go to Moscow. I wrote to her with tears.<br/>One thing I shall be ashamed of for ever. I referred to her being<br/>rich and having a dowry while I was only a stuck-up beggar! I<br/>mentioned money! I ought to have borne it in silence, but it<br/>slipped from my pen. Then I wrote at once to Ivan, and told him all<br/>I could about it in a letter of six pages, and sent him to her. Why<br/>do you look like that? Why are you staring at me? Yes, Ivan fell in<br/>love with her; he's in love with her still. I know that. I did a<br/>stupid thing, in the world's opinion; but perhaps that one stupid<br/>thing may be the saving of us all now. Oo! Don't you see what a lot<br/>she thinks of Ivan, how she respects him? When she compares us, do<br/>you suppose she can love a man like me, especially after all that<br/>has happened here?"<br/><br/>"But I'm convinced that she does love a man like you, and not a<br/>man like him."<br/><br/>"She loves her own virtue, not me." The words broke<br/>involuntarily, and almost malignantly, from Dmitri. He laughed, but<br/>a minute later his eyes gleamed, he flushed crimson and struck the<br/>table violently with his fist.<br/><br/>"I swear, Alyosha," he cried, with intense and genuine anger at<br/>himself; "You may not believe me, but as God is Holy, and as Christ<br/>is God, I swear that though I smiled at her lofty sentiments just<br/>now, I know that I am a million times baser in soul than she, and<br/>that these lofty sentiments of hers are as sincere as a heavenly<br/>angel's. That's the tragedy of it- that I know that for certain.<br/>What if anyone does show off a bit? Don't I do it myself? And yet<br/>I'm sincere, I'm sincere. As for Ivan, I can understand how he must<br/>be cursing nature now with his intellect, too! To see the<br/>preference given- to whom, to what? To a monster who, though he is<br/>betrothed and all eyes are fixed on him, can't restrain his<br/>debaucheries- and before the very eyes of his betrothed! And a man<br/>like me is preferred, while he is rejected. And why? Because a girl<br/>wants to sacrifice her life and destiny out of gratitude. It's<br/>ridiculous! I've never said a word of this to Ivan, and Ivan of<br/>course has never dropped a hint of the sort to me. But destiny will<br/>be accomplished, and the best man will hold his ground while the<br/>undeserving one will vanish into his back-alley for ever- his<br/>filthy back-alley, his beloved back-alley, where he is at home and<br/>where he will sink in filth and stench at his own free will and<br/>with enjoyment. I've been talking foolishly. I've no words left. I<br/>used them at random, but it will be as I have said. I shall drown<br/>in the back-alley, and she will marry Ivan."<br/><br/>"Stop, Dmitri," Alyosha interrupted again with great anxiety.<br/>"There's one thing you haven't made clear yet: you are still<br/>betrothed all the same, aren't you? How can you break off the<br/>engagement if she, your betrothed, doesn't want to?"<br/><br/>"Yes, formally and solemnly betrothed. It was all done on my<br/>arrival in Moscow, with great ceremony, with ikons, all in fine<br/>style. The general's wife blessed us, and- would you believe it?-<br/>congratulated Katya. You've made a good choice,' she said, 'I see<br/>right through him.' And- would you believe it?- she didn't like<br/>Ivan, and hardly greeted him. I had a lot of talk with Katya in<br/>Moscow. I told her about myself- sincerely, honourably. She<br/>listened to everything.<br/><br/>There was sweet confusion,<br/><br/>There were tender words. Though there were proud words, too. She<br/>wrung out of me a mighty promise to reform. I gave my promise, and<br/>here- "<br/><br/>"What?"<br/><br/>
