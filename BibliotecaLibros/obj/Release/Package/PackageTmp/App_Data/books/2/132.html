<br/>The boy waited for him without budging. Coming up to him,<br/>Alyosha saw facing him a child of about nine years old. He was an<br/>undersized weakly boy with a thin pale face, with large dark eyes<br/>that gazed at him vindictively. He was dressed in a rather shabby<br/>old overcoat, which he had monstrously outgrown. His bare arms<br/>stuck out beyond his sleeves. There was a large patch on the right<br/>knee of his trousers, and in his right boot just at the toe there<br/>was a big hole in the leather, carefully blackened with ink. Both<br/>the pockets of his greatcoat were weighed down with stones. Alyosha<br/>stopped two steps in front of him, looking inquiringly at him, The<br/>boy, seeing at once from Alyosha's eyes that he wouldn't beat him,<br/>became less defiant, and addressed him first.<br/><br/>"I am alone, and there are six of them. I'll beat them all,<br/>alone!" he said suddenly, with flashing eyes.<br/><br/>"I think one of the stones must have hurt you badly," observed<br/>Alyosha.<br/><br/>"But I hit Smurov on the head!" cried the boy.<br/><br/>"They told me that you know me, and that you threw a stone at me<br/>on purpose," said Alyosha.<br/><br/>The boy looked darkly at him.<br/><br/>"I don't know you. Do you know me?" Alyosha continued.<br/><br/>"Let me alone!" the boy cried irritably; but he did not move, as<br/>though he were expecting something, and again there was a<br/>vindictive light in his eyes.<br/><br/>"Very well, I am going," said Alyosha; "only I don't know you<br/>and I don't tease you. They told me how they tease you, but I don't<br/>want to tease you. Good-bye!"<br/><br/>"Monk in silk trousers!" cried the boy, following Alyosha with<br/>the same vindictive and defiant expression, and he threw himself<br/>into an attitude of defence, feeling sure that now Alyosha would<br/>fall upon him; but Alyosha turned, looked at him, and walked away.<br/>He had not gone three steps before the biggest stone the boy had in<br/>his pocket hit him a painful blow in the back.<br/><br/>
