"But not in a duel," cried my second again.<br/><br/>"That's what's so strange," I said. "For I ought to have owned<br/>my fault as soon as I got here, before he had fired a shot, before<br/>leading him into a great and deadly sin; but we have made our life<br/>so grotesque, that to act in that way would have been almost<br/>impossible, for only after I had faced his shot at the distance of<br/>twelve paces could my words have any significance for him, and if I<br/>had spoken before, he would have said, 'He is a coward, the sight<br/>of the pistols has frightened him, no use to listen to him.'<br/>Gentlemen," I cried suddenly, speaking straight from my heart,<br/>"look around you at the gifts of God, the clear sky, the pure air,<br/>the tender grass, the birds; nature is beautiful and sinless, and<br/>we, only we, are sinful and foolish, and we don't understand that<br/>life is heaven, for we have only to understand that and it will at<br/>once be fulfilled in all its beauty, we shall embrace each other<br/>and weep."<br/><br/>I would have said more but I could not; my voice broke with the<br/>sweetness and youthful gladness of it, and there was such bliss in<br/>my heart as I had never known before in my life.<br/><br/>"All this is rational and edifying," said my antagonist, "and in<br/>any case you are an original person."<br/><br/>"You may laugh," I said to him, laughing too, "but afterwards<br/>you will approve of me."<br/><br/>"Oh, I am ready to approve of you now," said he; "will you shake<br/>hands? for I believe you are genuinely sincere."<br/><br/>"No," I said, "not now, later on when I have grown worthier and<br/>deserve your esteem, then shake hands and you will do well."<br/><br/>We went home, my second upbraiding me all the way, while I<br/>kissed him. All my comrades heard of the affair at once and<br/>gathered together to pass judgment on me the same day.<br/><br/>"He has disgraced the uniform," they said; "Let him resign his<br/>commission."<br/><br/>Some stood up for me: "He faced the shot," they said.<br/><br/>"Yes, but he was afraid of his other shot and begged for<br/>forgiveness."<br/>
