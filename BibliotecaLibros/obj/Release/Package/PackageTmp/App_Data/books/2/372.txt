"No, I didn't go home," answered Mitya, apparently perfectly
composed, but looking at the floor.

"Allow me then to repeat my question," Nikolay Parfenovitch went
on as though creeping up to the subject. "Where were you able to
procure such a sum all at once, when by your own confession, at
five o'clock the same day you-"

"I was in want of ten roubles and pledged my pistols with
Perhotin, and then went to Madame Hohlakov to borrow three thousand
which she wouldn't give me, and so on, and all the rest of it,"
Mitya interrupted sharply. "Yes, gentlemen, I was in want of it,
and suddenly thousands turned up, eh? Do you know, gentlemen,
you're both afraid now 'what if he won't tell us where he got it?'
That's just how it is. I'm not going to tell you, gentlemen. You've
guessed right. You'll never know," said Mitya, chipping out each
word with extraordinary determination. The lawyers were silent for
a moment.

"You must understand, Mr. Karamazov, that it is of vital
importance for us to know," said Nikolay Parfenovitch, softly and
suavely.

"I understand; but still I won't tell you."

The prosecutor, too, intervened, and again reminded the prisoner
that he was at liberty to refuse to answer questions, if he thought
it to his interest, and so on. But in view of the damage he might
do himself by his silence, especially in a case of such importance
as-

"And so on, gentlemen, and so on. Enough! I've heard that
rigmarole before," Mitya interrupted again. "I can see for myself
how important it is, and that this is the vital point, and still I
won't say."

"What is it to us? It's not our business, but yours. .You are
doing yourself harm," observed Nikolay Parfenovitch nervously.

"You see, gentlemen, joking apart"- Mitya lifted his eyes and
looked firmly at them both- "I had an inkling from the first that
we should come to loggerheads at this point. But at first when I
began to give my evidence, it was all still far away and misty; it
was all floating, and I was so simple that I began with the
supposition of mutual confidence existing between us. Now I can see
for myself that such confidence is out of the question, for in any
case we were bound to come to this cursed stumbling-block. And now
we've come to it! It's impossible and there's an end of it! But I
don't blame you. You can't believe it all simply on my word. I
understand that, of course."

He relapsed into gloomy silence.
