<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>2<br/>He<br/>Gets Rid of His Eldest Son<br/><br/><br/>YOU can easily imagine what a father such a man could be and how<br/>he would bring up his children. His behaviour as a father was<br/>exactly what might be expected. He completely abandoned the child<br/>of his marriage with Adelaida Ivanovna, not from malice, nor<br/>because of his matrimonial grievances, but simply because he forgot<br/>him. While he was wearying everyone with his tears and complaints,<br/>and turning his house into a sink of debauchery, a faithful servant<br/>of the family, Grigory, took the three-year old Mitya into his<br/>care. If he hadn't looked after him there would have been no one<br/>even to change the baby's little shirt.<br/><br/>It happened moreover that the child's relations on his mother's<br/>side forgot him too at first. His grandfather was no longer living,<br/>his widow, Mitya's grandmother, had moved to Moscow, and was<br/>seriously ill, while his daughters were married, so that Mitya<br/>remained for almost a whole year in old Grigory's charge and lived<br/>with him in the servant's cottage. But if his father had remembered<br/>him (he could not, indeed, have been altogether unaware of his<br/>existence) he would have sent him back to the cottage, as the child<br/>would only have been in the way of his debaucheries. But a cousin<br/>of Mitya's mother, Pyotr Alexandrovitch Miusov, happened to return<br/>from Paris. He lived for many years afterwards abroad, but was at<br/>that time quite a young .man, and distinguished among the Miusovs<br/>as a man of enlightened ideas and of European culture, who had been<br/>in the capitals and abroad. Towards the end of his life he became a<br/>Liberal of the type common in the forties and fifties. In the<br/>course of his career he had come into contact with many of the most<br/>Liberal men of his epoch, both in Russia and abroad. He had known<br/>Proudhon and Bakunin personally, and in his declining years was<br/>very fond of describing the three days of the Paris Revolution of<br/>February, 1848, hinting that he himself had almost taken part in<br/>the fighting on the barricades. This was one of the most grateful<br/>recollections of his youth. He had an independent property of about<br/>a thousand souls, to reckon in the old style. His splendid estate<br/>lay on the outskirts of our little town and bordered on the lands<br/>of our famous monastery, with which Pyotr Alexandrovitch began an<br/>endless lawsuit, almost as soon as he came into the estate,<br/>concerning the rights of fishing in the river or wood-cutting in<br/>the forest, I don't know exactly which. He regarded it as his duty<br/>as a citizen and a man of culture to open an attack upon the<br/>"clericals." Hearing all about Adelaida Ivanovna, whom he, of<br/>course, remembered, and in whom he had at one time been interested,<br/>and learning of the existence of Mitya, he intervened, in spite of<br/>all his youthful indignation and contempt for Fyodor Pavlovitch. He<br/>made the latter's acquaintance for the first time, and told him<br/>directly that he wished to undertake the child's education. He used<br/>long afterwards to tell as a characteristic touch, that when he<br/>began to speak of Mitya, Fyodor Pavlovitch looked for some time as<br/>though he did not understand what child he was talking about, and<br/>even as though he was surprised to hear that he had a little son in<br/>the house. The story may have been exaggerated, yet it must have<br/>been something like the truth.<br/><br/>Fyodor Pavlovitch was all his life fond of acting, of suddenly<br/>playing an unexpected part, sometimes without any motive for doing<br/>so, and even to his own direct disadvantage, as, for instance, in<br/>the present case. This habit, however, is characteristic of a very<br/>great number of people, some of them very clever ones, not like<br/>Fyodor Pavlovitch. Pyotr Alexandrovitch carried the business<br/>through vigorously, and was appointed, with Fyodor Pavlovitch,<br/>joint guardian of the child, who had a small property, a house and<br/>land, left him by his mother. Mitya did, in fact, pass into this<br/>cousin's keeping, but as the latter had no family of his own, and<br/>after securing the revenues of his estates was in haste to return<br/>at once to Paris, he left the boy in charge of one of his cousins,<br/>a lady living in Moscow. It came to pass that, settling permanently<br/>in Paris he, too, forgot the child, especially when the Revolution<br/>of February broke out, making an impression on his mind that he<br/>remembered all the rest of his life. The Moscow lady died, and<br/>Mitya passed into the care of one of her married daughters. I<br/>believe he changed his home a fourth time later on. I won't enlarge<br/>upon that now, as I shall have much to tell later of Fyodor<br/>Pavlovitch's firstborn, and must confine myself now to the most<br/>essential facts about him, without which I could not begin my<br/>story.<br/><br/>In the first place, this Mitya, or rather Dmitri Fyodorovitch,<br/>was the only one of Fyodor Pavlovitch's three sons who grew up in<br/>the belief that he had property, and that he would be independent<br/>on coming of age. He spent an irregular boyhood and youth. He did<br/>not finish his studies at the gymnasium, he got into a military<br/>school, then went to the Caucasus, was promoted, fought a duel, and<br/>was degraded to the ranks, earned promotion again, led a wild life,<br/>and spent a good deal of money. He did not begin to receive any<br/>income from Fyodor Pavlovitch until he came of age, and until then<br/>got into debt. He saw and knew his father, Fyodor Pavlovitch, for<br/>the first time on coming of age, when he visited our neighbourhood<br/>on purpose to settle with him about his property. He seems not to<br/>have liked his father. He did not stay long with him, and made<br/>haste to get away, having only succeeded in obtaining a sum of<br/>money, and entering into an agreement for future payments from the<br/>estate, of the revenues and value of which he was unable (a fact<br/>worthy of note), upon this occasion, to get a statement from his<br/>father. Fyodor Pavlovitch remarked for the first time then (this,<br/>too, should be noted) that Mitya had a vague and exaggerated idea<br/>of his property. Fyodor Pavlovitch was very well satisfied with<br/>this, as it fell in with his own designs. He gathered only that the<br/>young man was frivolous, unruly, of violent passions, impatient,<br/>and dissipated, and that if he could only obtain ready money he<br/>would be satisfied, although only, of course, a short time. So<br/>Fyodor Pavlovitch began to take advantage of this fact, sending him<br/>from time to time small doles, instalments. In the end, when four<br/>years later, Mitya, losing patience, came a second time to our<br/>little town to settle up once for all with his father, it turned<br/>out to his amazement that he had nothing, that it was difficult to<br/>get an account even, that he had received the whole value of his<br/>property in sums of money from Fyodor Pavlovitch, and was perhaps<br/>even in debt to him, that by various agreements into which he had,<br/>of his own desire, entered at various previous dates, he had no<br/>right to expect anything more, and so on, and so on. The young man<br/>was overwhelmed, suspected deceit and cheating, and was almost<br/>beside himself. And, indeed, this circumstance led to the<br/>catastrophe, the account of which forms the subject of my first<br/>introductory story, or rather the external side of it. But before I<br/>pass to that story I must say a little of Fyodor Pavlovitch's other<br/>two sons, and of their origin.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
