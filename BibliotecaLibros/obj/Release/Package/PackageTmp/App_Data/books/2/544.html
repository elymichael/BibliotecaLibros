"Oh, yes, I was a young man then… . I was… well, I was<br/>forty-five then, and had only just come here. And I was so sorry<br/>for the boy then; I asked myself why shouldn't I buy him a pound<br/>of… a pound of what? I've forgotten what it's called. A pound of<br/>what children are very fond of, what is it, what is it?" The doctor<br/>began waving his hands again. "It grows on a tree and is gathered<br/>and given to everyone… "<br/><br/>"Apples?"<br/><br/>"Oh, no, no. You have a dozen of apples, not a pound… . No,<br/>there are a lot of them, and call little. You put them in the mouth<br/>and crack."<br/><br/>"Quite so, nuts, I say so." The doctor repeated in the calmest<br/>way as though he had been at no loss for a word. "And I bought him<br/>a pound of nuts, for no one had ever bought the boy a pound of nuts<br/>before. And I lifted my finger and said to him, 'Boy, Gott der<br/>Vater.' He laughed and said, 'Gott der Vater'… 'Gott der Sohn.' He<br/>laughed again and lisped 'Gott der Sohn.' 'Gott der heilige Geist.'<br/>Then he laughed and said as best he could, 'Gott der heilige<br/>Geist.' I went away, and two days after I happened to be passing,<br/>and he shouted to me of himself, 'Uncle, Gott der Vater, Gott der<br/>Sohn,' and he had only forgotten 'Gott der heilige Geist.' But I<br/>reminded him of it and I felt very sorry for him again. But he was<br/>taken away, and I did not see him again. Twenty-three years passed.<br/>I am sitting one morning in my study, a white-haired old man, when<br/>there walks into the room a blooming young man, whom I should never<br/>have recognised, but he held up his finger and said, laughing,<br/>'Gott der Vater, Gott der Sohn, and Gott der heilige Geist. I have<br/>just arrived and have come to thank you for that pound of nuts, for<br/>no one else ever bought me a pound of nuts; you are the only one<br/>that ever did.' then I remembered my happy youth and the poor child<br/>in the yard, without boots on his feet, and my heart was touched<br/>and I said, 'You are a grateful young man, for you have remembered<br/>all your life the pound of nuts I bought you in your childhood.'<br/>And I embraced him and blessed him. And I shed tears. He laughed,<br/>but he shed tears, too… for the Russian often laughs when he ought<br/>to be weeping. But he did weep; I saw it. And now, alas!… "<br/><br/>"And I am weeping now, German, I am weeping now, too, you<br/>saintly man," Mitya cried suddenly.<br/><br/>In any case the anecdote made a certain favourable impression on<br/>the public. But the chief sensation in Mitya's favour was created<br/>by the evidence of Katerina Ivanovna, which I will describe<br/>directly. Indeed, when the witnesses a decharge, that is, called<br/>the defence, began giving evidence, fortune seemed all at once<br/>markedly more favourable to Mitya, and what was particularly<br/>striking, this was a surprise even to the counsel for the defence.<br/>But before Katerina Ivanovna was called, Alyosha was examined, and<br/>he recalled a fact which seemed to furnish positive evidence<br/>against one important point made by the prosecution.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
