"Begin, panie," Mitya assented, pulling his notes out of his<br/>pocket, and laying two hundred-rouble notes on the table. "I want<br/>to lose a lot to you. Take your cards. Make the bank."<br/><br/>"We'll have cards from the landlord, panie," said the little<br/>Pole, gravely and emphatically.<br/><br/>"That's much the best way," chimed in Pan Vrublevsky.<br/><br/>"From the landlord? Very good, I understand, let's get them from<br/>him. Cards!" Mitya shouted to the landlord.<br/><br/>The landlord brought in a new, unopened pack, and informed Mitya<br/>that the girls were getting ready, and that the Jews with the<br/>cymbals would most likely be here soon; but the cart with the<br/>provisions had not yet arrived. Mitya jumped up from the table and<br/>ran into the next room to give orders, but only three girls had<br/>arrived, and Marya was not there yet. And he did not know himself<br/>what orders to give and why he had run out. He only told them to<br/>take out of the box the presents for the girls, the sweets, the<br/>toffee and the fondants. "And vodka for Andrey, vodka for Andrey!"<br/>he cried in haste. "I was rude to Andrey!"<br/><br/>Suddenly Maximov, who had followed him out, touched him on the<br/>shoulder.<br/><br/>"Give me five roubles," he whispered to Mitya. "I'll stake<br/>something at faro, too, he he!"<br/><br/>"Capital! Splendid! Take ten, here!"<br/><br/>Again he took all the notes out of his pocket and picked out one<br/>for ten roubles. "And if you lose that, come again, come<br/>again."<br/><br/>"Very good," Maximov whispered joyfully, and he ran back again.<br/>Mitya, too, returned, apologising for having kept them waiting. The<br/>Poles had already sat down, and opened the pack. They looked much<br/>more amiable, almost cordial. The Pole on the sofa had lighted<br/>another pipe and was preparing to throw. He wore an air of<br/>solemnity.<br/><br/>"To your places, gentlemen," cried Pan Vrublevsky.<br/>
