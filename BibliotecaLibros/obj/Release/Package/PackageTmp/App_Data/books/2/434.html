<br/>"Ilusha is very ill. He is certainly dying."<br/><br/>"How awful! You must admit that medicine is a fraud, Karamazov,"<br/>cried Kolya warmly.<br/><br/>"Ilusha has mentioned you often, very often, even in his sleep,<br/>in delirium, you know. One can see that you used to be very, very<br/>dear to him… before the incident… with the knife… . Then there's<br/>another reason… . Tell me, is that your dog?"<br/><br/>"Yes Perezvon."<br/><br/>"Not Zhutchka?" Alyosha looked at Kolya with eyes full of pity.<br/>"Is she lost for ever?"<br/><br/>"I know you would all like it to be Zhutchka. I've heard all<br/>about it." Kolya smiled mysteriously. "Listen, Karamazov, I'll tell<br/>you all about it. That's what I came for; that's what I asked you<br/>to come out here for, to explain the whole episode to you before we<br/>go in," he began with animation. "You see, Karamazov, Ilusha came<br/>into the preparatory class last spring. Well, you know what our<br/>preparatory class is- a lot of small boys. They began teasing<br/>Ilusha at once. I am two classes higher up, and, of course, I only<br/>look on at them from a distance. I saw the boy was weak and small,<br/>but he wouldn't give in to them; he fought with them. I saw he was<br/>proud, and his eyes were full of fire. I like children like that.<br/>And they teased him all the more. The worst of it was he was<br/>horribly dressed at the time, his breeches were too small for him,<br/>and there were holes in his boots. They worried him about it; they<br/>jeered at him. That I can't stand. I stood up for him at once, and<br/>gave it to them hot. I beat them, but they adore me, do you know,<br/>Karamazov?" Kolya boasted impulsively; "but I am always fond of<br/>children. I've two chickens in my hands at home now- that's what<br/>detained me to-day. So they left off beating Ilusha and I took him<br/>under my protection. I saw the boy was proud. I tell you that, the<br/>boy was proud; but in the end he became slavishly devoted to me: he<br/>did my slightest bidding, obeyed me as though I were God, tried to<br/>copy me. In the intervals between the classes he used to run to me<br/>at once' and I'd go about with him. On Sundays, too. They always<br/>laugh when an older boy makes friends with a younger one like that;<br/>but that's a prejudice. If it's my fancy, that's enough. I am<br/>teaching him, developing him. Why shouldn't I develop him if I like<br/>him? Here you, Karamazov, have taken up with all these nestlings. I<br/>see you want to influence the younger generation- to develop them,<br/>to be of use to them, and I assure you this trait in your<br/>character, which I knew by hearsay, attracted me more than<br/>anything. Let us get to the point, though. I noticed that there was<br/>a sort of softness and sentimentality coming over the boy, and you<br/>know I have a positive hatred of this sheepish sentimentality, and<br/>I have had it from a baby. There were contradictions in him, too:<br/>he was proud, but he was slavishly devoted to me, and yet all at<br/>once his eyes would flash and he'd refuse to agree with me; he'd<br/>argue, fly into a rage. I used sometimes to propound certain ideas;<br/>I could see that it was not so much that he disagreed with the<br/>ideas, but that he was simply rebelling against me, because I was<br/>cool in responding to his endearments. And so, in order to train<br/>him properly, the tenderer he was, the colder I became. I did it on<br/>purpose: that was my idea. My object was to form his character, to<br/>lick him into shape, to make a man of him… and besides… no doubt,<br/>you understand me at a word. Suddenly I noticed for three days in<br/>succession he was downcast and dejected, not because of my<br/>coldness, but for something else, something more important. I<br/>wondered what the tragedy was. I have pumped him and found out that<br/>he had somehow got to know Smerdyakov, who was footman to your late<br/>father- it was before his death, of course- and he taught the<br/>little fool a silly trick- that is, a brutal, nasty trick. He told<br/>him to take a piece of bread, to stick a pin in it, and throw it to<br/>one of those hungry dogs who snap up anything without biting it,<br/>and then to watch and see what would happen. So they prepared a<br/>piece of bread like that and threw it to Zhutchka, that shaggy dog<br/>there's been such a fuss about. The people of the house it belonged<br/>to never fed it at all, though it barked all day. (Do you like that<br/>stupid barking, Karamazov? I can't stand it.) So it rushed at the<br/>bread, swallowed it, and began to squeal; it turned round and round<br/>and ran away, squealing as it ran out of sight. That was Ilusha's<br/>own account of it. He confessed it to me, and cried bitterly. He<br/>hugged me, shaking all over. He kept on repeating 'He ran away<br/>squealing': the sight of that haunted him. He was tormented by<br/>remorse, I could see that. I took it seriously. I determined to<br/>give him a lesson for other things as well. So I must confess I<br/>wasn't quite straightforward, and pretended to be more indignant<br/>perhaps than I was. 'You've done a nasty thing,' I said, 'you are a<br/>scoundrel. I won't tell of it, of course, but I shall have nothing<br/>more to do with you for a time. I'll think it over and let you know<br/>through Smurov'- that's the boy who's just come with me; he's<br/>always ready to do anything for me- 'whether I will have anything<br/>to do with you in the future or whether I give you up for good as a<br/>scoundrel.' He was tremendously upset. I must own I felt I'd gone<br/>too far as I spoke, but there was no help for it. I did what I<br/>thought best at the time. A day or two after, I sent Smurov to tell<br/>him that I would not speak to him again. That's what we call it<br/>when two schoolfellows refuse to have anything more to do with one<br/>another. Secretly I only meant to send him to Coventry for a few<br/>days and then, if I saw signs of repentance, to hold out my hand to<br/>him again. That was my intention. But what do you think happened?<br/>He heard Smurov's message, his eyes flashed. 'Tell Krassotkin for<br/>me,' he cried, 'that I will throw bread with pins to all the dogs-<br/>all- all of them!' 'So he's going in for a little temper. We must<br/>smoke it out of him.' And I began to treat him with contempt;<br/>whenever I met him I turned away or smiled sarcastically. And just<br/>then that affair with his father happened. You remember? You must<br/>realise that he was fearfully worked up by what had happened<br/>already. The boys, seeing I'd given him up, set on him and taunted<br/>him, shouting, 'Wisp of tow, wisp of tow!' And he had soon regular<br/>skirmishes with them, which I am very sorry for. They seem to have<br/>given him one very bad beating. One day he flew at them all as they<br/>were coming out of school. I stood a few yards off, looking on.<br/>And, I swear, I don't remember that I laughed; it was quite the<br/>other way, I felt awfully sorry for him; in another minute I would<br/>have run up to take his part. But he suddenly met my eyes. I don't<br/>know what he fancied; but he pulled out a penknife, rushed at me,<br/>and struck at my thigh, here in my right leg. I didn't move. I<br/>don't mind owning I am plucky sometimes, Karamazov. I simply looked<br/>at him contemptuously, as though to say, 'This is how you repay all<br/>my kindness! Do it again if you like, I'm at your service.' But he<br/>didn't stab me again; he broke down; he was frightened at what he<br/>had done; he threw away the knife, burst out crying, and ran away.<br/>I did not sneak on him, of course, and I made them all keep quiet,<br/>so it shouldn't come to the ears of the masters. I didn't even tell<br/>my mother till it had healed up. And the wound was a mere scratch.<br/>And then I heard that the same day he'd been throwing stones and<br/>had bitten your finger- but you understand now what a state he was<br/>in! Well, it can't be helped: it was stupid of me not to come and<br/>forgive him- that is, to make it up with him- when he was taken<br/>ill. I am sorry for it now. But I had a special reason. So now I've<br/>told you all about it… but I'm afraid it was stupid of me."<br/><br/>"Oh, what a pity," exclaimed Alyosha, with feeling, "that I<br/>didn't know before what terms you were on with him, or I'd have<br/>come to you long ago to beg you to go to him with me. Would you<br/>believe it, when he was feverish he talked about you in delirium. I<br/>didn't know how much you were to him! And you've really not<br/>succeeded in finding that dog? His father and the boys have been<br/>hunting all over the town for it. Would you believe it, since he's<br/>been ill, I've three times heard him repeat with tears, 'It's<br/>because I killed Zhutchka, father, that I am ill now. God is<br/>punishing me for it.' He can't get that idea out of his head. And<br/>if the dog were found and proved to be alive, one might almost<br/>fancy the joy would cure him. We have all rested our hopes on<br/>you."<br/><br/>"Tell me, what made you hope that I should be the one to find<br/>him?" Kolya asked, with great curiosity. "Why did you reckon on me<br/>rather than anyone else?"<br/><br/>"There was a report that you were looking for the dog, and that<br/>you would bring it when you'd found it. Smurov said something of<br/>the sort. We've all been trying to persuade Ilusha that the dog is<br/>alive, that it's been seen. The boys brought him a live hare: he<br/>just looked at it, with a faint smile, and asked them to set it<br/>free in the fields. And so we did. His father has just this moment<br/>come back, bringing him a mastiff pup, hoping to comfort him with<br/>that; but I think it only makes it worse."<br/><br/>"Tell me, Karamazov, what sort of man is the father? I know him,<br/>but what do you make of him- a mountebank, a buffoon?"<br/><br/>
