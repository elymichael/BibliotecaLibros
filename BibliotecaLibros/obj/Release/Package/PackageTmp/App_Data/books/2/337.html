"I know, though you're a brute, you're generous," Grushenka<br/>articulated with difficulty. "It must be honourable… it shall be<br/>honourable for the future… and let us be honest, let us be good,<br/>not brutes, but good… take me away, take me far away, do you hear?<br/>I don't want it to be here, but far, far away… "<br/><br/>"Oh, yes, yes, it must be!" said Mitya, pressing her in his<br/>arms. "I'll take you and we'll fly away… . Oh, I'd give my whole<br/>life for one year only to know about that blood!"<br/><br/>"What blood?" asked Grushenka, bewildered.<br/><br/>"Nothing," muttered Mitya, through his teeth. "Grusha, you<br/>wanted to be honest, but I'm a thief. But I've stolen money from<br/>Katya… . Disgrace, a disgrace!"<br/><br/>"From Katya, from that young lady? No, you didn't steal it. Give<br/>it back to her, take it from me… . Why make a fuss? Now everything<br/>of mine is yours. What does money matter? We shall waste it anyway…<br/>. Folks like us are bound to waste money. But we'd better go and<br/>work the land. I want to dig the earth with my own hands. We must<br/>work, do you hear? Alyosha said so. I won't be your mistress, I'll<br/>be faithful to you, I'll be your slave, I'll work for you. We'll go<br/>to the young lady and bow down to her together, so that she may<br/>forgive us, and then we'll go away. And if she won't forgive us,<br/>we'll go, anyway. Take her money and love me… . Don't love her… .<br/>Don't love her any more. If you love her, I shall strangle her… .<br/>I'll put out both her eyes with a needle… "<br/><br/>"I love you. love only you. I'll love you in Siberia… "<br/><br/>"Why Siberia? Never mind, Siberia, if you like. I don't care…<br/>we'll work… there's snow in Siberia… . I love driving in the snow…<br/>and must have bells… . Do you hear, there's a bell ringing? Where<br/>is that bell ringing? There are people coming… . Now it's<br/>stopped."<br/><br/>She closed her eyes, exhausted, and suddenly fell asleep for an<br/>instant. There had certainly been the sound of a bell in the<br/>distance, but the ringing had ceased. Mitya let his head sink on<br/>her breast. He did not notice that the bell had ceased ringing, nor<br/>did he notice that the songs had ceased, and that instead of<br/>singing and drunken clamour there was absolute stillness in the<br/>house. Grushenka opened her eyes.<br/><br/>"What's the matter? Was I asleep? Yes… a bell… I've been asleep<br/>and dreamt I was driving over the snow with bells, and I dozed. I<br/>was with someone I loved, with you. And far, far away. I was<br/>holding you and kissing you, nestling close to you. I was cold, and<br/>the snow glistened… . You know how the snow glistens at night when<br/>the moon shines. It was as though I was not on earth. I woke up,<br/>and my dear one is close to me. How sweet that is!… "<br/><br/>"Close to you," murmured Mitya, kissing her dress, her bosom,<br/>her hands. And suddenly he had a strange fancy: it seemed to him<br/>that she was looking straight before her, not at him, not into his<br/>face, but over his head, with an intent, almost uncanny fixity. An<br/>expression of wonder, almost of alarm, came suddenly into her<br/>face.<br/><br/>"Mitya, who is that looking at us?" she whispered.<br/>
