"Did you drink much? Roughly speaking, a wine-glass or two?"<br/><br/>"It might have been a tumbler-full."<br/><br/>"A tumbler-full, even. Perhaps a tumbler and a half?"<br/><br/>Grigory did not answer. He seemed to see what was meant.<br/><br/>"A glass and a half of neat spirit- is not at all bad, don't you<br/>think? You might see the gates of heaven open, not only the door<br/>into the garden?"<br/><br/>Grigory remained silent. There was another laugh in the court.<br/>The President made a movement.<br/><br/>"Do you know for a fact," Fetyukovitch persisted, "whether you<br/>were awake or not when you saw the open door?"<br/><br/>"I was on my legs."<br/><br/>"That's not a proof that you were awake." (There was again<br/>laughter in the court.) "Could you have answered at that moment, if<br/>anyone had asked you a question- for instance, what year it<br/>is?"<br/><br/>"I don't know."<br/><br/>"And what year is it, Anno Domini, do you know?"<br/>
