<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>8<br/>The Scandalous Scene<br/><br/><br/>MIUSOV, as a man of breeding and delicacy, could not but feel<br/>some inward qualms, when he reached the Father Superior's with<br/>Ivan: he felt ashamed of having lost his temper. He felt that he<br/>ought to have disdained that despicable wretch, Fyodor Pavlovitch,<br/>too much to have been upset by him in Father Zossima's cell, and so<br/>to have forgotten himself. "The monks were not to blame, in any<br/>case," he reflected, on the steps. "And if they're decent people<br/>here (and the Father Superior, I understand, is a nobleman) why not<br/>be friendly and courteous with them? I won't argue, I'll fall in<br/>with everything, I'll win them by politeness, and… and… show them<br/>that I've nothing to do with that Aesop, that buffoon, that<br/>Pierrot, and have merely been taken in over this affair, just as<br/>they have."<br/><br/>He determined to drop his litigation with the monastery, and<br/>relinquish his claims to the wood-cutting and fishery rights at<br/>once. He was the more ready to do this because the rights had<br/>become much less valuable, and he had indeed the vaguest idea where<br/>the wood and river in question were.<br/><br/>These excellent intentions were strengthened when he entered the<br/>Father Superior's dining-room, though, strictly speaking, it was<br/>not a dining-room, for the Father Superior had only two rooms<br/>altogether; they were, however, much larger and more comfortable<br/>than Father Zossima's. But there was no great luxury about the<br/>furnishing of these rooms either. The furniture was of mahogany,<br/>covered with leather, in the old-fashioned style of 1820 the floor<br/>was not even stained, but everything was shining with cleanliness,<br/>and there were many choice flowers in the windows; the most<br/>sumptuous thing in the room at the moment was, of course, the<br/>beautifully decorated table. The cloth was clean, the service<br/>shone; there were three kinds of well-baked bread, two bottles of<br/>wine, two of excellent mead, and a large glass jug of kvas- both<br/>the latter made in the monastery, and famous in the neighbourhood.<br/>There was no vodka. Rakitin related afterwards that there were five<br/>dishes: fish-soup made of sterlets, served with little fish<br/>patties; then boiled fish served in a special way; then salmon<br/>cutlets, ice pudding and compote, and finally, blanc-mange. Rakitin<br/>found out about all these good things, for he could not resist<br/>peeping into the kitchen, where he already had a footing. He had a<br/>footing everywhere, and got information about everything. He was of<br/>an uneasy and envious temper. He was well aware of his own<br/>considerable abilities, and nervously exaggerated them in his<br/>self-conceit. He knew he would play a prominent part of some sort,<br/>but Alyosha, who was attached to him, was distressed to see that<br/>his friend Rakitin was dishonourable, and quite unconscious of<br/>being so himself, considering, on the contrary, that because he<br/>would not steal money left on the table he was a man of the highest<br/>integrity. Neither Alyosha nor anyone else could have influenced<br/>him in that.<br/><br/>Rakitin, of course, was a person of too little consequence to be<br/>invited to the dinner, to which Father Iosif, Father Paissy, and<br/>one other monk were the only inmates of the monastery invited. They<br/>were already waiting when Miusov, Kalganov, and Ivan arrived. The<br/>other guest, Maximov, stood a little aside, waiting also. The<br/>Father Superior stepped into the middle of the room to receive his<br/>guests. He was a tall, thin, but still vigorous old man, with black<br/>hair streaked with grey, and a long, grave, ascetic face. He bowed<br/>to his guests in silence. But this time they approached to receive<br/>his blessing. Miusov even tried to kiss his hand, but the Father<br/>Superior drew it back in time to avoid the salute. But Ivan and<br/>Kalganov went through the ceremony in the most simple-hearted and<br/>complete manner, kissing his hand as peasants do.<br/><br/>"We must apologise most humbly, your reverence," began Miusov,<br/>simpering affably, and speaking in a dignified and respectful tone.<br/>"Pardon us for having come alone without the gentleman you invited,<br/>Fyodor Pavlovitch. He felt obliged to decline the honour of your<br/>hospitality, and not without reason. In the reverend Father<br/>Zossima's cell he was carried away by the unhappy dissension with<br/>his son, and let fall words which were quite out of keeping… in<br/>fact, quite unseemly… as"- he glanced at the monks- "your reverence<br/>is, no doubt, already aware. And therefore, recognising that he had<br/>been to blame, he felt sincere regret and shame, and begged me, and<br/>his son Ivan Fyodorovitch, to convey to you his apologies and<br/>regrets. In brief, he hopes and desires to make amends later. He<br/>asks your blessing, and begs you to forget what has taken<br/>place."<br/><br/>As he uttered the last word of his tirade, Miusov completely<br/>recovered his self-complacency, and all traces of his former<br/>irritation disappeared. He fully and sincerely loved humanity<br/>again.<br/><br/>The Father Superior listened to him with dignity, and, with a<br/>slight bend of the head, replied:<br/>
