<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>3<br/>The Medical Experts and a Pound of Nuts<br/><br/><br/>THE evidence of the medical experts, too, was of little use to<br/>the prisoner. And it appeared later that Fetyukovitch had not<br/>reckoned much upon it. The medical line of defence had only been<br/>taken up through the insistence of Katerina Ivanovna, who had sent<br/>for a celebrated doctor from Moscow on purpose. The case for the<br/>defence could, of course, lose nothing by it and might, with luck,<br/>gain something from it. There was, however, an element of comedy<br/>about it, through the difference of opinion of the doctors. The<br/>medical experts were the famous doctor from Moscow, our doctor,<br/>Herzenstube, and the young doctor, Varvinsky. The two latter<br/>appeared also as witnesses for the prosecution.<br/><br/>The first to be called in the capacity of expert was Doctor<br/>Herzenstube. He was a grey and bald old man of seventy, of middle<br/>height and sturdy build. He was much esteemed and respected by<br/>everyone in the town. He was a conscientious doctor and an<br/>excellent and pious man, a Hernguter or Moravian brother, I am not<br/>quite sure which. He had been living amongst us for many years and<br/>behaved with wonderful dignity. He was a kind-hearted and humane<br/>man. He treated the sick poor and peasants for nothing, visited<br/>them in their slums and huts, and left money for medicine, but he<br/>was as obstinate as a mule. If once he had taken an idea into his<br/>head, there was no shaking it. Almost everyone in the town was<br/>aware, by the way, that the famous doctor had, within the first two<br/>or three days of his presence among us, uttered some extremely<br/>offensive allusions to Doctor Herzenstube's qualifications. Though<br/>the Moscow doctor asked twenty-five roubles for a visit, several<br/>people in the town were glad to take advantage of his arrival, and<br/>rushed to consult him regardless of expense. All these had, of<br/>course, been previously patients of Doctor Herzenstube, and the<br/>celebrated doctor had criticised his treatment with extreme<br/>harshness. Finally, he had asked the patients as soon as he saw<br/>them, "Well, who has been cramming you with nostrums? Herzenstube?<br/>He he!" Doctor Herzenstube, of course, heard all this, and now all<br/>the three doctors made their appearance, one after another, to be<br/>examined.<br/><br/>Doctor Herzenstube roundly declared that the abnormality of the<br/>prisoner's mental faculties was self-evident. Then giving his<br/>grounds for this opinion, which I omit here, he added that the<br/>abnormality was not only evident in many of the prisoner's actions<br/>in the past, but was apparent even now at this very moment. When he<br/>was asked to explain how it was apparent now at this moment, the<br/>old doctor, with simple-hearted directness, pointed out that the<br/>prisoner had "an extraordinary air, remarkable in the<br/>circumstances"; that he had "marched in like a soldier, looking<br/>straight before him, though it would have been more natural for him<br/>to look to the left where, among the public, the ladies were<br/>sitting, seeing that he was a great admirer of the fair sex and<br/>must be thinking much of what the ladies are saying of him now,"<br/>the old man concluded in his peculiar language.<br/><br/>I must add that he spoke Russian readily, but every phrase was<br/>formed in German style, which did not, however, trouble him, for it<br/>had always been a weakness of his to believe that he spoke Russian<br/>perfectly, better indeed than Russians. And he was very fond of<br/>using Russian proverbs, always declaring that the Russian proverbs<br/>were the best and most expressive sayings in the whole world. I may<br/>remark, too, that in conversation, through absent-mindedness he<br/>often forgot the most ordinary words, which sometimes went out of<br/>his head, though he knew them perfectly. The same thing happened,<br/>though, when he spoke German, and at such times he always waved his<br/>hand before his face as though trying to catch the lost word, and<br/>no one could induce him to go on speaking till he had found the<br/>missing word. His remark that the prisoner ought to have looked at<br/>the ladies on entering roused a whisper of amusement in the<br/>audience. All our ladies were very fond of our old doctor; they<br/>knew, too, that having been all his life a bachelor and a religious<br/>man of exemplary conduct, he looked upon women as lofty creatures.<br/>And so his unexpected observation struck everyone as very<br/>queer.<br/><br/>The Moscow doctor, being questioned in his turn, definitely and<br/>emphatically repeated that he considered the prisoner's mental<br/>condition abnormal in the highest degree. He talked at length and<br/>with erudition of "aberration" and "mania," and argued that, from<br/>all the facts collected, the prisoner had undoubtedly been in a<br/>condition of aberration for several days before his arrest, and, if<br/>the crime had been committed by him, it must, even if he were<br/>conscious of it, have been almost involuntary, as he had not the<br/>power to control the morbid impulse that possessed him.<br/><br/>But apart from temporary aberration, the doctor diagnosed mania,<br/>which promised, in his words, to lead to complete insanity in the<br/>future. (It must be noted that I report this in my own words, the<br/>doctor made use of very learned and professional language.) "All<br/>his actions are in contravention of common sense and logic," he<br/>continued. "Not to refer to what I have not seen, that is, the<br/>crime itself and the whole catastrophe, the day before yesterday,<br/>while he was talking to me, he had an unaccountably fixed look in<br/>his eye. He laughed unexpectedly when there was nothing to laugh<br/>at. He showed continual and inexplicable irritability, using<br/>strange words, 'Bernard!' 'Ethics!' and others equally<br/>inappropriate." But the doctor detected mania, above all, in the<br/>fact that the prisoner could not even speak of the three thousand<br/>roubles, of which he considered himself to have been cheated,<br/>without extraordinary irritation, though he could speak<br/>comparatively lightly of other misfortunes and grievances.<br/>According to all accounts, he had even in the past, whenever the<br/>subject of the three thousand roubles was touched on, flown into a<br/>perfect frenzy, and yet he was reported to be a disinterested and<br/>not grasping man.<br/><br/>"As to the opinion of my learned colleague," the Moscow doctor<br/>added ironically in conclusion "that the prisoner would, entering<br/>the court, have naturally looked at the ladies and not straight<br/>before him, I will only say that, apart from the playfulness of<br/>this theory, it is radically unsound. For though I fully agree that<br/>the prisoner, on entering the court where his fate will be decided,<br/>would not naturally look straight before him in that fixed way, and<br/>that that may really be a sign of his abnormal mental condition, at<br/>the same time I maintain that he would naturally not look to the<br/>left at the ladies, but, on the contrary, to the right to find his<br/>legal adviser, on whose help all his hopes rest and on whose<br/>defence all his future depends." The doctor expressed his opinion<br/>positively and emphatically.<br/>
