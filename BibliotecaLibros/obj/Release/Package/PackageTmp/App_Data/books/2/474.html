"I not only say it, I shall do it."<br/><br/>"I believe you."<br/><br/>"Ah, how I love you for saying you believe me. And you are not<br/>lying one little bit. But perhaps you think that I am saying all<br/>this on purpose to annoy you?"<br/><br/>"No, I don't think thatâ€¦ though perhaps there is a little desire<br/>to do that in it, too."<br/><br/>"There is a little. I never can tell lies to you," she declared,<br/>with a strange fire in her eyes.<br/><br/>What struck Alyosha above everything was her earnestness. There<br/>was not a trace of humour or jesting in her face now, though, in<br/>old days, fun and gaiety never deserted her even at her most<br/>"earnest" moments.<br/><br/>"There are moments when people love crime," said Alyosha<br/>thoughtfully.<br/><br/>"Yes, yes! You have uttered my thought; they love crime,<br/>everyone loves crime, they love it always, not at some 'moments.'<br/>You know, it's as though people have made an agreement to lie about<br/>it and have lied about it ever since. They all declare that they<br/>hate evil, but secretly they all love it."<br/><br/>"And are you still reading nasty books?"<br/><br/>"Yes, I am. Mamma reads them and hides them under her pillow and<br/>I steal them."<br/><br/>"Aren't you ashamed to destroy yourself?"<br/>
