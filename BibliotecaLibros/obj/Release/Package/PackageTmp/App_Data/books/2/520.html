<br/>"Listen, you miserable, contemptible creature! Don't you<br/>understand that if I haven't killed you, it's simply because I am<br/>keeping you to answer to-morrow at the trial. God sees," Ivan<br/>raised his hand, "perhaps I, too, was guilty; perhaps I really had<br/>a secret desire for my father'sâ€¦ death, but I swear I was not as<br/>guilty as you think, and perhaps I didn't urge you on at all. No,<br/>no, I didn't urge you on! But no matter, I will give evidence<br/>against myself to-morrow at the trial. I'm determined to! I shall<br/>tell everything, everything. But we'll make our appearance<br/>together. And whatever you may say against me at the trial,<br/>whatever evidence you give, I'll face it; I am not afraid of you.<br/>I'll confirm it all myself! But you must confess, too! You must,<br/>you must; we'll go together. That's how it shall be!"<br/><br/>Ivan said this solemnly and resolutely and from his flashing<br/>eyes alone it could be seen that it would be so.<br/><br/>"You are ill, I see; you are quite ill. Your eyes are yellow,"<br/>Smerdyakov commented, without the least irony, with apparent<br/>sympathy in fact.<br/><br/>"We'll go together," Ivan repeated. "And if you won't go, no<br/>matter, I'll go alone."<br/><br/>Smerdyakov paused as though pondering.<br/><br/>"There'll be nothing of the sort, and you won't go," he<br/>concluded at last positively.<br/><br/>"You don't understand me," Ivan exclaimed reproachfully.<br/><br/>"You'll be too much ashamed, if you confess it all. And, what's<br/>more, it will be no use at all, for I shall say straight out that I<br/>never said anything of the sort to you, and that you are either ill<br/>(and it looks like it, too), or that you're so sorry for your<br/>brother that you are sacrificing yourself to save him and have<br/>invented it all against me, for you've always thought no more of me<br/>than if I'd been a fly. And who will believe you, and what single<br/>proof have you got?"<br/><br/>"Listen, you showed me those notes just now to convince me."<br/><br/>Smerdyakov lifted the book off the notes and laid it on one<br/>side.<br/><br/>
