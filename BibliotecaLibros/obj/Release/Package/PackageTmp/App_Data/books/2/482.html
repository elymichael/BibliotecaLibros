"Rakitin knows. Rakitin knows a lot, damn him! He's not going to<br/>be a monk. He means to go to Petersburg. There he'll go in for<br/>criticism of an elevating tendency. Who knows, he may be of use and<br/>make his own career, too. Ough! they are first-rate, these people,<br/>at making a career! Damn ethics, I am done for, Alexey, I am, you<br/>man of God! I love you more than anyone. It makes my heart yearn to<br/>look at you. Who was Karl Bernard?"<br/><br/>"Karl Bernard?" Alyosha was surprised again.<br/><br/>"No, not Karl. Stay, I made a mistake. Claude Bernard. What was<br/>he? Chemist or what?"<br/><br/>"He must be a savant," answered Alyosha; "but I confess I can't<br/>tell you much about him, either. I've heard of him as a savant, but<br/>what sort I don't know."<br/><br/>"Well, damn him, then! I don't know either," swore Mitya. "A<br/>scoundrel of some sort, most likely. They are all scoundrels. And<br/>Rakitin will make his way. Rakitin will get on anywhere; he is<br/>another Bernard. Ugh, these Bernards! They are all over the<br/>place."<br/><br/>"But what is the matter?" Alyosha asked insistently.<br/><br/>"He wants to write an article about me, about my case, and so<br/>begin his literary career. That's what he comes for; he said so<br/>himself. He wants to prove some theory. He wants to say 'he<br/>couldn't help murdering his father, he was corrupted by his<br/>environment,' and so on. He explained it all to me. He is going to<br/>put in a tinge of Socialism, he says. But there, damn the fellow,<br/>he can put in a tinge if he likes, I don't care. He can't bear<br/>Ivan, he hates him. He's not fond of you, either. But I don't turn<br/>him out, for he is a clever fellow. Awfully conceited, though. I<br/>said to him just now,' The Karamazovs are not blackguards, but<br/>philosophers; for all true Russians are philosophers, and though<br/>you've studied, you are not a philosopher- you are a low fellow.'<br/>He laughed, so maliciously. And I said to him, 'De ideabus non est<br/>disputandum.'<br/>[14]<br/>Isn't that rather good? I can set up<br/>for being a classic, you see!" Mitya laughed suddenly. "Why is it<br/>all over with you? You said so just now," Alyosha interposed. "Why<br/>is it all over with me? H'm!… The fact of it is… if you take it as<br/>a whole, I am sorry to lose God- that's why it is." "What do you<br/>mean by 'sorry to lose God'?" "Imagine: inside, in the nerves, in<br/>the head- that is, these nerves are there in the brain… (damn<br/>them!) there are sort of little tails, the little tails of those<br/>nerves, and as soon as they begin quivering… that is, you see, I<br/>look at something with my eyes and then they begin quivering, those<br/>little tails… and when they quiver, then an image appears… it<br/>doesn't appear at once, but an instant, a second, passes… and then<br/>something like a moment appears; that is, not a moment- devil take<br/>the moment!- but an image; that is, an object, or an action, damn<br/>it! That's why I see and then think, because of those tails, not at<br/>all because I've got a soul, and that I am some sort of image and<br/>likeness. All that is nonsense! Rakitin explained it all to me<br/>yesterday, brother, and it simply bowled me over. It's magnificent,<br/>Alyosha, this science! A new man's arising- that I understand… .<br/>And yet I am sorry to lose God!" "Well, that's a good thing,<br/>anyway," said Alyosha. "That I am sorry to lose God? It's<br/>chemistry, brother, chemistry! There's no help for it, your<br/>reverence, you must make way for chemistry. And Rakitin does<br/>dislike God. Ough! doesn't he dislike Him! That's the sore point<br/>with all of them. But they conceal it. They tell lies. They<br/>pretend. 'Will you preach this in your reviews?' I asked him. 'Oh,<br/>well, if I did it openly, they won't let it through, 'he said. He<br/>laughed. 'But what will become of men then?' I asked him, 'without<br/>God and immortal life? All things are lawful then, they can do what<br/>they like?' 'Didn't you know?' he said laughing, 'a clever man can<br/>do what he likes,' he said. 'A clever man knows his way about, but<br/>you've put your foot in it, committing a murder, and now you are<br/>rotting in prison.' He says that to my face! A regular pig! I used<br/>to kick such people out, but now I listen to them. He talks a lot<br/>of sense, too. Writes well. He began reading me an article last<br/>week. I copied out three lines of it. Wait a minute. Here it is."<br/>Mitya hurriedly pulled out a piece of paper from his pocket and<br/>read: "'In order to determine this question, it is above all<br/>essential to put one's personality in contradiction to one's<br/>reality.' Do you understand that?" "No, I don't," said Alyosha. He<br/>looked at Mitya and listened to him with curiosity. "I don't<br/>understand either. It's dark and obscure, but intellectual.<br/>'Everyone writes like that now,' he says, 'it's the effect of their<br/>environment.' They are afraid of the environment. He writes poetry,<br/>too, the rascal. He's written in honour of Madame Hohlakov's foot.<br/>Ha ha ha!" "I've heard about it," said Alyosha. "Have you? And have<br/>you heard the poem?" "No." "I've got it. Here it is. I'll read it<br/>to you. You don't know- I haven't told you- there's quite a story<br/>about it. He's a rascal! Three weeks ago he began to tease me.<br/>'You've got yourself into a mess, like a fool, for the sake of<br/>three thousand, but I'm going to collar a hundred and fifty<br/>thousand. I am going to marry a widow and buy a house in<br/>Petersburg.' And he told me he was courting Madame Hohlakov. She<br/>hadn't much brains in her youth, and now at forty she has lost what<br/>she had. 'But she's awfully sentimental,' he says; 'that's how I<br/>shall get hold of her. When I marry her, I shall take her to<br/>Petersburg and there I shall start a newspaper.' And his mouth was<br/>simply watering, the beast, not for the widow, but for the hundred<br/>and fifty thousand. And he made me believe it. He came to see me<br/>every day. 'She is coming round,' he declared. He was beaming with<br/>delight. And then, all of a sudden, he was turned out of the house.<br/>Perhotin's carrying everything before him, bravo! I could kiss the<br/>silly old noodle for turning him out of the house. And he had<br/>written this doggerel. 'It's the first time I've soiled my hands<br/>with writing poetry,' he said. 'It's to win her heart, so it's in a<br/>good cause. When I get hold of the silly woman's fortune, I can be<br/>of great social utility.' They have this social justification for<br/>every nasty thing they do! 'Anyway it's better than your Pushkin's<br/>poetry,' he said, 'for I've managed to advocate enlightenment even<br/>in that.' I understand what he means about Pushkin, I quite see<br/>that, if he really was a man of talent and only wrote about women's<br/>feet. But wasn't Rakitin stuck up about his doggerel! The vanity of<br/>these fellows! 'On the convalescence of the swollen foot of the<br/>object of my affections'- he thought of that for a title. He's a<br/>waggish fellow. {verse A captivating little foot, Though swollen<br/>and red and tender! The doctors come and plasters put, But still<br/>they cannot mend her. Yet, 'tis not for her foot I dread- A theme<br/>for Pushkin's muse more fit- It's not her foot, it is her head: I<br/>tremble for her loss of wit! For as her foot swells, strange to<br/>say, Her intellect is on the wane- Oh, for some remedy I pray<br/>{verse That may restore both foot and brain! He is a pig, a regular<br/>pig, but he's very arch, the rascal! And he really has put in a<br/>progressive idea. And wasn't he angry when she kicked him out! He<br/>was gnashing his teeth!" "He's taken his revenge already," said<br/>Alyosha. "He's written a paragraph about Madame Hohlakov." And<br/>Alyosha told him briefly about the paragraph in Gossip. "That's his<br/>doing, that's his doing!" Mitya assented, frowning. "That's him!<br/>These paragraphs… I know… the insulting things that have been<br/>written about Grushenka, for instance… . And about Katya, too… .<br/>H'm! He walked across the room with a harassed air. "Brother, I<br/>cannot stay long," Alyosha said, after a pause. "To-morrow will be<br/>a great and awful day for you, the judgment of God will be<br/>accomplished… I am amazed at you, you walk about here, talking of I<br/>don't know what… " "No, don't be amazed at me," Mitya broke in<br/>warmly. "Am I to talk of that stinking dog? Of the murderer? We've<br/>talked enough of him. I don't want to say more of the stinking son<br/>of Stinking Lizaveta! God will kill him, you will see. Hush!" He<br/>went up to Alyosha excitedly and kissed him. His eyes glowed.<br/>"Rakitin wouldn't understand it," he began in a sort of exaltation;<br/>"but you, you'll understand it all. That's why I was thirsting for<br/>you. You see, there's so much I've been wanting to tell you for<br/>ever so long, here, within these peeling walls, but I haven't said<br/>a word about what matters most; the moment never seems to have<br/>come. Now I can wait no longer. I must pour out my heart to you.<br/>Brother, these last two months I've found in myself a new man. A<br/>new man has risen up in me. He was hidden in me, but would never<br/>have come to the surface, if it hadn't been for this blow from<br/>heaven. I am afraid! And what do I care if I spend twenty years in<br/>the mines, breaking ore with a hammer? I am not a bit afraid of<br/>that- it's something else I am afraid of now: that that new man may<br/>leave me. Even there, in the mines, underground, I may find a human<br/>heart in another convict and murderer by my side, and I may make<br/>friends with him, for even there one may live and love and suffer.<br/>One may thaw and revive a frozen heart in that convict, one may<br/>wait upon him for years, and at last bring up from the dark depths<br/>a lofty soul, a feeling, suffering creature; one may bring forth an<br/>angel, create a hero! There are so many of them, hundreds of them,<br/>and we are all to blame for them. Why was it I dreamed of that<br/>'babe' at such a moment? 'Why is the babe so poor?' That was a sign<br/>to me at that moment. It's for the babe I'm going. Because we are<br/>all responsible for all. For all the 'babes,' for there are big<br/>children as well as little children All are 'babes.' I go for all,<br/>because someone must go for all. I didn't kill father, but I've got<br/>to go. I accept it. It's all come to me here, here, within these<br/>peeling walls. There are numbers of them there, hundreds of them<br/>underground, with hammers in their hands. Oh, yes, we shall be in<br/>chains and there will be no freedom, but then, in our great sorrow,<br/>we shall rise again to joy, without which man cannot live nor God<br/>exist, for God gives joy: it's His privilege- a grand one. Ah, man<br/>should be dissolved in prayer! What should I be underground there<br/>without God? Rakitin's laughing! If they drive God from the earth,<br/>we shall shelter Him underground. One cannot exist in prison<br/>without God; it's even more impossible than out of prison. And then<br/>we men underground will sing from the bowels of the earth a<br/>glorious hymn to God, with Whom is joy. Hail to God and His joy! I<br/>love Him!" Mitya was almost gasping for breath as he uttered his<br/>wild speech. He turned pale, his lips quivered, and tears rolled<br/>down his cheeks. "Yes, life is full, there is life even<br/>underground," he began again. "You wouldn't believe, Alexey, how I<br/>want to live now, what a thirst for existence and consciousness has<br/>sprung up in me within these peeling walls. Rakitin doesn't<br/>understand that; all he cares about is building a house and letting<br/>flats. But I've been longing for you. And what is suffering? I am<br/>not afraid of it, even if it were beyond reckoning. I am not afraid<br/>of it now. I was afraid of it before. Do you know, perhaps I won't<br/>answer at the trial at all… . And I seem to have such strength in<br/>me now, that I think I could stand anything, any suffering, only to<br/>be able to say and to repeat to myself every moment, 'I exist.' In<br/>thousands of agonies- I exist. I'm tormented on the rack- but I<br/>exist! Though I sit alone on a pillar- I exist! I see the sun, and<br/>if I don't see the sun, I know it's there. And there's a whole life<br/>in that, in knowing that the sun is there. Alyosha, my angel, all<br/>these philosophies are the death of me. Damn them! Brother Ivan-"<br/>"What of brother Ivan?" interrupted Alyosha, but Mitya did not<br/>hear. "You see, I never had any of these doubts before, but it was<br/>all hidden away in me. It was perhaps just because ideas I did not<br/>understand were surging up in me, that I used to drink and fight<br/>and rage. It was to stifle them in myself, to still them, to<br/>smother them. Ivan is not Rakitin, there is an idea in him. Ivan is<br/>a sphinx and is silent; he is always silent. It's God that's<br/>worrying me. That's the only thing that's worrying me. What if He<br/>doesn't exist? What if Rakitin's right- that it's an idea made up<br/>by men? Then if He doesn't exist, man is the chief of the earth, of<br/>the universe. Magnificent! Only how is he going to be good without<br/>God? That's the question. I always come back to that. For whom is<br/>man going to love then? To whom will he be thankful? To whom will<br/>he sing the hymn? Rakitin laughs. Rakitin says that one can love<br/>humanity without God. Well, only a snivelling idiot can maintain<br/>that. I can't understand it. Life's easy for Rakitin. 'You'd better<br/>think about the extension of civic rights, or even of keeping down<br/>the price of meat. You will show your love for humanity more simply<br/>and directly by that, than by philosophy.' I answered him, 'Well,<br/>but you, without a God, are more likely to raise the price of meat,<br/>if it suits you, and make a rouble on every copeck.' He lost his<br/>temper. But after all, what is goodness? Answer me that, Alexey.<br/>Goodness is one thing with me and another with a Chinaman, so it's<br/>a relative thing. Or isn't it? Is it not relative? A treacherous<br/>question! You won't laugh if I tell you it's kept me awake two<br/>nights. I only wonder now how people can live and think nothing<br/>about it. Vanity! Ivan has no God. He has an idea. It's beyond me.<br/>But he is silent. I believe he is a Freemason. I asked him, but he<br/>is silent. I wanted to drink from the springs of his soul- he was<br/>silent. But once he did drop a word." "What did he say?" Alyosha<br/>took it up quickly. "I said to him, 'Then everything is lawful, if<br/>it is so?' He frowned. 'Fyodor Pavlovitch, our papa,' he said, 'was<br/>a pig, but his ideas were right enough.' That was what he dropped.<br/>That was all he said. That was going one better than Rakitin."<br/>"Yes," Alyosha assented bitterly. "When was he with you?" "Of that<br/>later; now I must speak of something else. I have said nothing<br/>about Ivan to you before. I put it off to the last. When my<br/>business here is over and the verdict has been given, then I'll<br/>tell you something. I'll tell you everything. We've something<br/>tremendous on hand… . And you shall be my judge in it. But don't<br/>begin about that now; be silent. You talk of to-morrow, of the<br/>trial; but, would you believe it, I know nothing about it." "Have<br/>you talked to the counsel?" "What's the use of the counsel? I told<br/>him all about it. He's a soft, city-bred rogue- a Bernard! But he<br/>doesn't believe me- not a bit of it. Only imagine, he believes I<br/>did it. I see it. 'In that case,' I asked him, 'why have you come<br/>to defend me?' Hang them all! They've got a doctor down, too, want<br/>to prove I'm mad. I won't have that! Katerina Ivanovna wants to do<br/>her 'duty' to the end, whatever the strain!" Mitya smiled bitterly.<br/>"The cat! Hard-hearted creature! She knows that I said of her at<br/>Mokroe that she was a woman of 'great wrath.' They repeated it.<br/>Yes, the facts against me have grown numerous as the sands of the<br/>sea. Grigory sticks to his point. Grigory's honest, but a fool.<br/>Many people are honest because they are fools: that's Rakitin's<br/>idea. Grigory's my enemy. And there are some people who are better<br/>as foes than friends. I mean Katerina Ivanovna. I am afraid, oh, I<br/>am afraid she will tell how she bowed to the ground after that four<br/>thousand. She'll pay it back to the last farthing. I don't want her<br/>sacrifice; they'll put me to shame at the trial. I wonder how I can<br/>stand it. Go to her, Alyosha, ask her not to speak of that in the<br/>court, can't you? But damn it all, it doesn't matter! I shall get<br/>through somehow. I don't pity her. It's her own doing. She deserves<br/>what she gets. I shall have my own story to tell, Alexey." He<br/>smiled bitterly again. "Only… only Grusha, Grusha! Good Lord! Why<br/>should she have such suffering to bear?" he exclaimed suddenly,<br/>with tears. "Grusha's killing me; the thought of her's killing me,<br/>killing me. She was with me just now… " "She told me she was very<br/>much grieved by you to-day." "I know. Confound my temper! It was<br/>jealousy. I was sorry, I kissed her as she was going. I didn't ask<br/>her forgiveness." "Why didn't you?" exclaimed Alyosha. Suddenly<br/>Mitya laughed almost mirthfully. "God preserve you, my dear boy,<br/>from ever asking forgiveness for a fault from a woman you love.<br/>From one you love especially, however greatly you may have been in<br/>fault. For a woman- devil only knows what to make of a woman! I<br/>know something about them, anyway. But try acknowledging you are in<br/>fault to a woman. Say, 'I am sorry, forgive me,' and a shower of<br/>reproaches will follow! Nothing will make her forgive you simply<br/>and directly, she'll humble you to the dust, bring forward things<br/>that have never happened, recall everything, forget nothing, add<br/>something of her own, and only then forgive you. And even the best,<br/>the best of them do it. She'll scrape up all the scrapings and load<br/>them on your head. They are ready to flay you alive, I tell you,<br/>every one of them, all these angels without whom we cannot live! I<br/>tell you plainly and openly, dear boy, every decent man ought to be<br/>under some woman's thumb. That's my conviction- not conviction, but<br/>feeling. A man ought to be magnanimous, and it's no disgrace to a<br/>man! No disgrace to a hero, not even a Caesar! But don't ever beg<br/>her pardon all the same for anything. Remember that rule given you<br/>by your brother Mitya, who's come to ruin through women. No, I'd<br/>better make it up to Grusha somehow, without begging pardon. I<br/>worship her, Alexey, worship her. Only she doesn't see it. No, she<br/>still thinks I don't love her enough. And she tortures me, tortures<br/>me with her love. The past was nothing! In the past it was only<br/>those infernal curves of hers that tortured me, but now I've taken<br/>all her soul into my soul and through her I've become a man myself.<br/>Will they marry us? If they don't, I shall die of jealousy. I<br/>imagine something every day… . What did she say to you about me?"<br/>Alyosha repeated all Grushenka had said to him that day. Mitya<br/>listened, made him repeat things, and seemed pleased. "Then she is<br/>not angry at my being jealous?" he exclaimed. "She is a regular<br/>woman! 'I've a fierce heart myself!' Ah, I love such fierce hearts,<br/>though I can't bear anyone's being jealous of me. I can't endure<br/>it. We shall fight. But I shall love her, I shall love her<br/>infinitely. Will they marry us? Do they let convicts marry? That's<br/>the question. And without her I can't exist… " Mitya walked<br/>frowning across the room. It was almost dark. He suddenly seemed<br/>terribly worried. "So there's a secret, she says, a secret? We have<br/>got up a plot against her, and Katya is mixed up in it, she thinks.<br/>No, my good Grushenka, that's not it. You are very wide of the<br/>mark, in your foolish feminine way. Alyosha, darling, well, here<br/>goes! I'll tell you our secret!" He looked round, went close up<br/>quickly to Alyosha, who was standing before him, and whispered to<br/>him with an air of mystery, though in reality no one could hear<br/>them: the old warder was dozing in the corner, and not a word could<br/>reach the ears of the soldiers on guard. "I will tell you all our<br/>secret," Mitya whispered hurriedly. "I meant to tell you later, for<br/>how could I decide on anything without you? You are everything to<br/>me. Though I say that Ivan is superior to us, you are my angel.<br/>It's your decision will decide it. Perhaps it's you that is<br/>superior and not Ivan. You see, it's a question of conscience,<br/>question of the higher conscience- the secret is so important that<br/>I can't settle it myself, and I've put it off till I could speak to<br/>you. But anyway it's too early to decide now, for we must wait for<br/>the verdict. As soon as the verdict is given, you shall decide my<br/>fate. Don't decide it now. I'll tell you now. You listen, but don't<br/>decide. Stand and keep quiet. I won't tell you everything. I'll<br/>only tell you the idea, without details, and you keep quiet. Not a<br/>question, not a movement. You agree? But, goodness, what shall I do<br/>with your eyes? I'm afraid your eyes will tell me your decision,<br/>even if you don't speak. Oo! I'm afraid! Alyosha, listen! Ivan<br/>suggests my escaping. I won't tell you the details: it's all been<br/>thought out: it can all be arranged. Hush, don't decide. I should<br/>go to America with Grusha. You know I can't live without Grusha!<br/>What if they won't let her follow me to Siberia? Do they let<br/>convicts get married? Ivan thinks not. And without Grusha what<br/>should I do there underground with a hammer? I should only smash my<br/>skull with the hammer! But, on the other hand, my conscience? I<br/>should have run away from suffering. A sign has come, I reject the<br/>sign. I have a way of salvation and I turn my back on it. Ivan says<br/>that in America, 'with the goodwill,' I can be of more use than<br/>underground. But what becomes of our hymn from underground? What's<br/>America? America is vanity again! And there's a lot of swindling in<br/>America, too, I expect. I should have run away from crucifixion! I<br/>tell you, you know, Alexey, because you are the only person who can<br/>understand this. There's no one else. It's folly, madness to<br/>others, all I've told you of the hymn. They'll say I'm out of my<br/>mind or a fool. I am not out of my mind and I am not a fool. Ivan<br/>understands about the hymn, too. He understands, only he doesn't<br/>answer- he doesn't speak. He doesn't believe in the hymn. Don't<br/>speak, don't speak. I see how you look! You have already decided.<br/>Don't decide, spare me! I can't live without Grusha. Wait till<br/>after the trial!" Mitya ended beside himself. He held Alyosha with<br/>both hands on his shoulders, and his yearning, feverish eyes were<br/>fixed on his brother's. "They don't let convicts marry, do they?"<br/>he repeated for the third time in a supplicating voice. Alyosha<br/>listened with extreme surprise and was deeply moved. "Tell me one<br/>thing," he said. "Is Ivan very keen on it, and whose idea was it?"<br/>"His, his, and he is very keen on it. He didn't come to see me at<br/>first, then he suddenly came a week ago and he began about it<br/>straight away. He is awfully keen on it. He doesn't ask me, but<br/>orders me to escape. He doesn't doubt of my obeying him, though I<br/>showed him all my heart as I have to you, and told him about the<br/>hymn, too. He told me he'd arrange it; he's found out about<br/>everything. But of that later. He's simply set on it. It's all a<br/>matter of money: he'll pay ten thousand for escape and give me<br/>twenty thousand for America. And he says we can arrange a<br/>magnificent escape for ten thousand." "And he told you on no<br/>account to tell me?" Alyosha asked again. "To tell no one, and<br/>especially not you; on no account to tell you. He is afraid, no<br/>doubt, that you'll stand before me as my conscience. Don't tell him<br/>I told you. Don't tell him, for anything." "You are right," Alyosha<br/>pronounced; "it's impossible to decide anything before the trial is<br/>over. After the trial you'll decide of yourself. Then you'll find<br/>that new man in yourself and he will decide." "A new man, or a<br/>Bernard who'll decide a la Bernard, for I believe I'm a<br/>contemptible Bernard myself," said Mitya, with a bitter grin. "But,<br/>brother, have you no hope then of being acquitted?" Mitya shrugged<br/>his shoulders nervously and shook his head. "Alyosha, darling, it's<br/>time you were going," he said, with a sudden haste. "There's the<br/>superintendent shouting in the yard. He'll be here directly. We are<br/>late; it's irregular. Embrace me quickly. Kiss me! Sign me with the<br/>cross, darling, for the cross I have to bear to-morrow." They<br/>embraced and kissed. "Ivan," said Mitya suddenly, "suggests my<br/>escaping; but, of course, he believes I did it." A mournful smile<br/>came on to his lips. "Have you asked him whether he believes it?"<br/>asked Alyosha. "No, I haven't. I wanted to, but I couldn't. I<br/>hadn't the courage. But I saw it from his eyes. Well, good-bye!"<br/>Once more they kissed hurriedly, and Alyosha was just going out,<br/>when Mitya suddenly called him back. "Stand facing me! That's<br/>right!" And again he seized Alyosha, putting both hands on his<br/>shoulders. His face became suddenly quite pale, so that it was<br/>dreadfully apparent, even through the gathering darkness. His lips<br/>twitched, his eyes fastened upon Alyosha. "Alyosha, tell me the<br/>whole truth, as you would before God. Do you believe I did it? Do<br/>you, do you in yourself, believe it? The whole truth, don't lie!"<br/>he cried desperately. Everything seemed heaving before Alyosha, and<br/>he felt something like a stab at his heart. "Hush! What do you<br/>mean?" he faltered helplessly. "The whole truth, the whole, don't<br/>lie!" repeated Mitya. "I've never for one instant believed that you<br/>were the murderer!" broke in a shaking voice from Alyosha's breast,<br/>and he raised his right hand in the air, as though calling God to<br/>witness his words. Mitya's whole face was lighted up with bliss.<br/>"Thank you!" he articulated slowly, as though letting a sigh escape<br/>him after fainting. "Now you have given me new life. Would you<br/>believe it, till this moment I've been afraid to ask you, you, even<br/>you. Well, go! You've given me strength for to-morrow. God bless<br/>you! Come, go along! Love Ivan!" was Mitya's last word. Alyosha<br/>went out in tears. Such distrustfulness in Mitya, such lack of<br/>confidence even to him, to Alyosha- all this suddenly opened before<br/>Alyosha an unsuspected depth of hopeless grief and despair in the<br/>soul of his unhappy brother. Intense, infinite compassion<br/>overwhelmed him instantly. There was a poignant ache in his torn<br/>heart. "Love Ivan"- he suddenly recalled Mitya's words. And he was<br/>going to Ivan. He badly wanted to see Ivan all day. He was as much<br/>worried about Ivan as about Mitya, and more than ever now.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
