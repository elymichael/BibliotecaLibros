O Lord, have mercy

On her and on me!

On her and on me!

On her and on me!

The voice ceased. It was a lackey's tenor and a lackey's song.
Another voice, a woman's, suddenly asked insinuatingly and
bashfully, though with mincing affectation:

dignity. It was clear that the man had the best of the position,
and that the woman was making advances. "I believe the man must be
Smerdyakov," thought Alyosha, "from his voice. And the lady must be
the daughter of the house here, who has come from Moscow, the one

"I am awfully fond of verses of all kinds, if they rhyme," the
woman's voice continued. "Why don't you go on?"

The man sang again:

What do I care for royal wealth
