Distrust the worthless, lying crowd,

And lay aside thy doubts. I'm not drinking, I'm only
'indulging,' as that pig, your Rakitin, says. He'll be a civil
councillor one day, but he'll always talk about 'indulging.' Sit
down. I could take you in my arms, Alyosha, and press you to my
bosom till I crush you, for in the whole world- in reality- in
real-i-ty- (can you take it in?) I love no one but you!

He uttered the last words in a sort of exaltation.

"No one but you and one 'jade' I have fallen in love with, to my
ruin. But being in love doesn't mean loving. You may be in love
with a woman and yet hate her. Remember that! I can talk about it
gaily still. Sit down here by the table and I'll sit beside you and
look at you, and go on talking. You shall keep quiet and I'll go on
talking, for the time has come. But on reflection, you know, I'd
better speak quietly, for here- here- you can never tell what ears
are listening. I will explain everything; as they say, 'the story
will be continued.' Why have I been longing for you? Why have I
been thirsting for you all these days, and just now? (It's five
days since I've cast anchor here.) Because it's only to you I can
tell everything; because I must, because I need you, because
to-morrow I shall fly from the clouds, because to-morrow life is
ending and beginning. Have you ever felt, have you ever dreamt of
falling down a precipice into a pit? That's just how I'm falling,
but not in a dream. And I'm not afraid, and don't you be afraid. At
least, I am afraid, but I enjoy it. It's not enjoyment though, but
ecstasy. Damn it all, whatever it is! A strong spirit, a weak
spirit, a womanish spirit- what, ever it is! Let us praise nature:
you see what sunshine, how clear the sky is, the leaves are all
green, it's still summer; four o'clock in the afternoon and the
stillness! Where were you going?"

"I was going to father's, but I meant to go to Katerina
Ivanovna's first."

"To her, and to father! Oo! what a coincidence! Why was I
waiting for you? Hungering and thirsting for you in every cranny of
my soul and even in my ribs? Why, to send you to father and to her,
Katerina Ivanovna, so as to have done with her and with father. To
send an angel. I might have sent anyone, but I wanted to send an
angel. And here you are on your way to see father and her."

"Did you really mean to send me?" cried Alyosha with a
distressed expression.

"Stay! You knew it And I see you understand it all at once. But
be quiet, be quiet for a time. Don't be sorry, and don't cry."

Dmitri stood up, thought a moment, and put his finger to his
forehead.

"She's asked you, written to you a letter or something, that's
why you're going to her? You wouldn't be going except for
that?"

"Here is her note." Alyosha took it out of his pocket. Mitya
looked through it quickly.
