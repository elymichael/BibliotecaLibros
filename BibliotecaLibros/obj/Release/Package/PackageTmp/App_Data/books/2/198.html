<br/>"Get up, my dear boy," the elder went on to Alyosha. "Let me<br/>look at you. Have you been home and seen your brother?" It seemed<br/>strange to Alyosha that he asked so confidently and precisely,<br/>about one of his brothers only- but which one? Then perhaps he had<br/>sent him out both yesterday and to-day for the sake of that<br/>brother.<br/><br/>"I have seen one of my brothers," answered Alyosha.<br/><br/>"I mean the elder one, to whom I bowed down."<br/><br/>"I only saw him yesterday and could not find him to-day," said<br/>Alyosha.<br/><br/>"Make haste to find him, go again to-morrow and make haste,<br/>leave everything and make haste. Perhaps you may still have time to<br/>prevent something terrible. I bowed down yesterday to the great<br/>suffering in store for him."<br/><br/>He was suddenly silent and seemed to be pondering. The words<br/>were strange. Father Iosif, who had witnessed the scene yesterday,<br/>exchanged glances with Father Paissy. Alyosha could not resist<br/>asking:<br/><br/>"Father and teacher," he began with extreme emotion, "your words<br/>are too obscure… . What is this suffering in store for him?"<br/><br/>"Don't inquire. I seemed to see something terrible yesterday… as<br/>though his whole future were expressed in his eyes. A look came<br/>into his eyes- so that I was instantly horror-stricken at what that<br/>man is preparing for himself. Once or twice in my life I've seen<br/>such a look in a man's face… reflecting as it were his future fate,<br/>and that fate, alas, came to pass. I sent you to him, Alexey, for I<br/>thought your brotherly face would help him. But everything and all<br/>our fates are from the Lord. 'Except a corn of wheat fall into the<br/>ground and die, it abideth alone; but if it die, it bringeth forth<br/>much fruit.' Remember that. You, Alexey, I've many times silently<br/>blessed for your face, know that," added the elder with a gentle<br/>smile. "This is what I think of you, you will go forth from these<br/>walls, but will live like a monk in the world. You will have many<br/>enemies, but even your foes will love you. Life will bring you many<br/>misfortunes, but you will find your happiness in them, and will<br/>bless life and will make others bless it- which is what matters<br/>most. Well, that is your character. Fathers and teachers," he<br/>addressed his friends with a tender smile, "I have never till<br/>to-day told even him why the face of this youth is so dear to me.<br/>Now I will tell you. His face has been as it were a remembrance and<br/>a prophecy for me. At the dawn of my life when I was a child I had<br/>an elder brother who died before my eyes at seventeen. And later on<br/>in the course of my life I gradually became convinced that that<br/>brother had been for a guidance and a sign from on high for me. For<br/>had he not come into my life, I should never perhaps, so I fancy at<br/>least, have become a monk and entered on this precious path. He<br/>appeared first to me in my childhood, and here, at the end of my<br/>pilgrimage, he seems to have come to me over again. It is<br/>marvellous, fathers and teachers, that Alexey, who has some, though<br/>not a great, resemblance in face, seems to me so like him<br/>spiritually, that many times I have taken him for that young man,<br/>my brother, mysteriously come back to me at the end of my<br/>pilgrimage, as a reminder and an inspiration. So that I positively<br/>wondered at so strange a dream in myself. Do you hear this,<br/>Porfiry?" he turned to the novice who waited on him. "Many times<br/>I've seen in your face as it were a look of mortification that I<br/>love Alexey more than you. Now you know why that was so, but I love<br/>you too, know that, and many times I grieved at your mortification.<br/>I should like to tell you, dear friends, of that youth, my brother,<br/>for there has been no presence in my life more precious, more<br/>significant and touching. My heart is full of tenderness, and I<br/>look at my whole life at this moment as though living through it<br/>again."<br/><br/>Here I must observe that this last conversation of Father<br/>Zossima with the friends who visited him on the last day of his<br/>life has been partly preserved in writing. Alexey Fyodorovitch<br/>Karamazov wrote it down from memory, some time after his elder's<br/>death. But whether this was only the conversation that took place<br/>then, or whether he added to it his notes of parts of former<br/>conversations with his teacher, I cannot determine. In his account,<br/>Father Zossima's talk goes on without interruption, as though he<br/>told his life to his friends in the form of a story, though there<br/>is no doubt, from other accounts of it, that the conversation that<br/>evening was general. Though the guests did not interrupt Father<br/>Zossima much, yet they too talked, perhaps even told something<br/>themselves. Besides, Father Zossima could not have carried on an<br/>uninterrupted narrative, for he was sometimes gasping for breath,<br/>his voice failed him, and he even lay down to rest on his bed,<br/>though he did not fall asleep and his visitors did not leave their<br/>seats. Once or twice the conversation was interrupted by Father<br/>Paissy's reading the Gospel. It is worthy of note, too, that no one<br/>of them supposed that he would die that night, for on that evening<br/>of his life after his deep sleep in the day he seemed suddenly to<br/>have found new strength, which kept him up through this long<br/>conversation. It was like a last effort of love which gave him<br/>marvellous energy; only for a little time, however, for his life<br/>was cut short immediately.. But of that later. I will only add now<br/>that I have preferred to confine myself to the account given by<br/>Alexey Fyodorovitch Karamazov. It will be shorter and not so<br/>fatiguing, though, of course, as I must repeat, Alyosha took a<br/>great deal from previous conversations and added them to it.
