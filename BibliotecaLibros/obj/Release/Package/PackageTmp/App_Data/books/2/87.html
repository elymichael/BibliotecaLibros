"Why? Isn't it funny?" asked Fyodor Pavlovitch. Smerdyakov did<br/>not speak.<br/><br/>"Answer stupid!"<br/><br/>"It's all untrue," mumbled the boy, with a grin.<br/><br/>"Then go to the devil! You have the soul of a lackey. Stay,<br/>here's Smaragdov's Universal History. That's all true. Read<br/>that."<br/><br/>But Smerdyakov did not get through ten pages of Smaragdov. He<br/>thought it dull. So the bookcase was closed again.<br/><br/>Shortly afterwards Marfa and Grigory reported to Fyodor<br/>Pavlovitch that Smerdyakov was gradually beginning to show an<br/>extraordinary fastidiousness. He would sit before his soup, take up<br/>his spoon and look into the soup, bend over it, examine it, take a<br/>spoonful and hold it to the light.<br/><br/>"What is it? A beetle?" Grigory would ask.<br/><br/>"A fly, perhaps," observed Marfa.<br/><br/>The squeamish youth never answered, but he did the same with his<br/>bread, his meat, and everything he ate. He would hold a piece on<br/>his fork to the light, scrutinise it microscopically, and only<br/>after long deliberation decide to put it in his mouth.<br/><br/>"Ach! What fine gentlemen's airs!" Grigory muttered, looking at<br/>him.<br/><br/>When Fyodor Pavlovitch heard of this development in Smerdyakov<br/>he determined to make him his cook, and sent him to Moscow to be<br/>trained. He spent some years there and came back remarkably changed<br/>in appearance. He looked extraordinarily old for his age. His face<br/>had grown wrinkled, yellow, and strangely emasculate. In character<br/>he seemed almost exactly the same as before he went away. He was<br/>just as unsociable, and showed not the slightest inclination for<br/>any companionship. In Moscow, too, as we heard afterwards, he had<br/>always been silent. Moscow itself had little interest for him; he<br/>saw very little there, and took scarcely any notice of anything. He<br/>went once to the theatre, but returned silent and displeased with<br/>it. On the other hand, he came back to us from Moscow well dressed,<br/>in a clean coat and clean linen. He brushed his clothes most<br/>scrupulously twice a day invariably, and was very fond of cleaning<br/>his smart calf boots with a special English polish, so that they<br/>shone like mirrors. He turned out a first rate cook. Fyodor<br/>Pavlovitch paid him a salary, almost the whole of which Smerdyakov<br/>spent on clothes, pomade, perfumes, and such things. But he seemed<br/>to have as much contempt for the female sex as for men; he was<br/>discreet, almost unapproachable, with them. Fyodor Pavlovitch began<br/>to regard him rather differently. His fits were becoming more<br/>frequent, and on the days he was ill Marfa cooked, which did not<br/>suit Fyodor Pavlovitch at all.<br/>
