<br/>"Alyosha! Alyosha! What do you say to that! Ah, you casuist! He<br/>must have been with the Jesuits, somewhere, Ivan. Oh, you stinking<br/>Jesuit,who taught you? But you're talking nonsense, you casuist,<br/>nonsense, nonsense, nonsense. Don't cry, Grigory, we'll reduce him<br/>to smoke and ashes in a moment. Tell me this, O ass; you may be<br/>right before your enemies, but you have renounced your faith all<br/>the same in your own heart, and you say yourself that in that very<br/>hour you became anathema accursed. And if once you're anathema they<br/>won't pat you on the head for it in hell. What do you say to that,<br/>my fine Jesuit?"<br/><br/>"There is no doubt that I have renounced it in my own heart, but<br/>there no special sin in that. Or if there was sin, it was the most<br/>ordinary."<br/><br/>"How's that the most ordinary?"<br/><br/>"You lie, accursed one!" hissed Grigory.<br/><br/>"Consider yourself, Grigory Vassilyevitch," Smerdyakov went on,<br/>staid and unruffled, conscious of his triumph, but, as it were,<br/>generous to the vanquished foe. "Consider yourself, Grigory<br/>Vassilyevitch; it is said in the Scripture that if you have faith,<br/>even as a mustard seed, and bid a mountain move into the sea, it<br/>will move without the least delay at your bidding. Well, Grigory<br/>Vassilyevitch, if I'm without faith and you have so great a faith<br/>that you are continually swearing at me, you try yourself telling<br/>this mountain, not to move into the sea for that's a long way off,<br/>but even to our stinking little river which runs at the bottom of<br/>the garden. You'll see for yourself that it won't budge, but will<br/>remain just where it is however much you shout at it, and that<br/>shows, Grigory Vassilyevitch, that you haven't faith in the proper<br/>manner, and only abuse others about it. Again, taking into<br/>consideration that no one in our day, not only you, but actually no<br/>one, from the highest person to the lowest peasant, can shove<br/>mountains into the sea- except perhaps some one man in the world,<br/>or, at most, two, and they most likely are saving their souls in<br/>secret somewhere in the Egyptian desert, so you wouldn't find them-<br/>if so it be, if all the rest have no faith, will God curse all the<br/>rest? that is, the population of the whole earth, except about two<br/>hermits in the desert, and in His well-known mercy will He not<br/>forgive one of them? And so I'm persuaded that though I may once<br/>have doubted I shall be forgiven if I shed tears of<br/>repentance."<br/><br/>"Stay!" cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, in a transport of delight. "So<br/>you do suppose there are two who can move mountains? Ivan, make a<br/>note of it, write it down. There you have the Russian all<br/>over!"<br/><br/>"You're quite right in saying it's characteristic of the<br/>people's faith," Ivan assented, with an approving smile.<br/><br/>"You agree. Then it must be so, if you agree. It's true, isn't<br/>it Alyosha? That's the Russian faith all over, isn't it?"<br/><br/>"No, Smerdyakov has not the Russian faith at all," said Alyosha<br/>firmly and gravely.<br/><br/>"I'm not talking about his faith. I mean those two in the<br/>desert, only that idea. Surely that's Russian, isn't it?"<br/><br/>
