"Well, yes, it does."

"Ech, what a life!" The peasant heaved a sigh from the bottom of
his heart.

"Good-bye, Matvey."

"Good-bye. You are a nice chap, that you are."

The boys went on.

"That was a nice peasant," Kolya observed to Smurov. "I like
talking to the peasants, and am always glad to do them
justice."

"Why did you tell a lie, pretending we are thrashed?" asked
Smurov.

"I had to say that to please him."

"How do you mean?"

"You know, Smurov, I don't like being asked the same thing
twice. I like people to understand at the first word. Some things
can't be explained. According to a peasant's notions, schoolboys
are whipped, and must be whipped. What would a schoolboy be if he
were not whipped? And if I were to tell him we are not, he'd be
disappointed. But you don't understand that. One has to know how to
talk to the peasants."
