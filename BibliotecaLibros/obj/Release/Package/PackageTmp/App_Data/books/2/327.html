"Nothing… . I left a man ill there. I'd give ten years of my<br/>life for him to get well, to know he was all right!"<br/><br/>"Well, never mind him, if he's ill. So you meant to shoot<br/>yourself to-morrow! What a silly boy! What for? I like such<br/>reckless fellows as you," she lisped, with a rather halting tongue.<br/>"So you would go any length for me, eh? Did you really mean to<br/>shoot yourself to-morrow, you stupid? No, wait a little. To-morrow<br/>I may have something to say to you… . I won't say it to-day, but<br/>to-morrow. You'd like it to be to-day? No, I don't want to to-day.<br/>Come, go along now, go and amuse yourself."<br/><br/>Once, however, she called him, as it were, puzzled and<br/>uneasy.<br/><br/>"Why are you sad? I see you're sad… . Yes, I see it," she added,<br/>looking intently into his eyes. "Though you keep kissing the<br/>peasants and shouting, I see something. No, be merry. I'm merry;<br/>you be merry, too… . I love somebody here. Guess who it is. Ah,<br/>look, my boy has fallen asleep, poor dear, he's drunk."<br/><br/>She meant Kalganov.

Two girls dressed up as bears, and a<br/>lively girl, called Stepanida, with a stick in her hand, acted the<br/>part of keeper, and began to "show them."<br/><br/>"Look alive, Marya, or you'll get the stick!<br/><br/>The bears rolled on the ground at last in the most unseemly<br/>fashion, amid roars of laughter from the closely-packed crowd of<br/>men and women.<br/><br/>"Well, let them! Let them!" said Grushenka sententiously, with<br/>an ecstatic expression on her face. "When they do get a day to<br/>enjoy themselves; why shouldn't folks be happy?"<br/><br/>Kalgonov looked as though he had been besmirched with dirt.<br/><br/>"It's swinish, all this peasant foolery," he murmured, moving<br/>away; "it's the game they play when it's light all night in<br/>summer."<br/><br/>He particularly disliked one "new" song to a jaunty dance-tune.<br/>It described how a gentleman came and tried his luck with the<br/>girls, to see whether they would love him:<br/>
