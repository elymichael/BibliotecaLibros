"In the first place I am not thirteen, but fourteen, fourteen in<br/>a fortnight," he flushed angrily, "and in the second place I am at<br/>a complete loss to understand what my age has to do with it? The<br/>question is what are my convictions, not what is my age, isn't<br/>it?"<br/><br/>"When you are older, you'll understand for yourself the<br/>influence of age on convictions. I fancied, too, that you were not<br/>expressing your own ideas," Alyosha answered serenely and modestly,<br/>but Kolya interrupted him hotly:<br/><br/>"Come, you want obedience and mysticism. You must admit that the<br/>Christian religion, for instance, has only been of use to the rich<br/>and the powerful to keep the lower classes in slavery. That's so,<br/>isn't it?"<br/><br/>"Ah, I know where you read that, and I am sure someone told you<br/>so!" cried Alyosha.<br/><br/>"I say, what makes you think I read it? And certainly no one<br/>told so. I can think for myself… . I am not opposed to Christ, if<br/>you like. He was a most humane person, and if He were alive to-day,<br/>He would be found in the ranks of the revolutionists, and would<br/>perhaps play a conspicuous part… . There's no doubt about<br/>that."<br/><br/>"Oh, where, where did you get that from? What fool have you made<br/>friends with?" exclaimed Alyosha.<br/><br/>"Come, the truth will out! It has so chanced that I have often<br/>talked to Mr. Rakitin, of course, but… old Byelinsky said that,<br/>too, so they say."<br/><br/>"Byelinsky? I don't remember. He hasn't written that<br/>anywhere."<br/><br/>"If he didn't write it, they say he said it. I heard that from<br/>a… but never mind."<br/><br/>"And have you read Byelinsky?"<br/><br/>"Well, no… I haven't read all of him, but… I read the passage<br/>about Tatyana, why she didn't go off with Onyegin."<br/>
