"But did you serve in the cavalry? You were talking about the
cavalry. Were you a cavalry officer?" put in Kalgonov at once.

"Was he a cavalry officer indeed? Ha ha!" cried Mitya, listening
eagerly, and turning his inquiring eyes to each as he spoke, as
though there were no knowing what he might hear from each.

"No, you see," Maximov turned to him. "What I mean is that those
pretty Polish ladies&#160;… when they danced the mazurka with our
Uhlans… when one of them dances a mazurka with a Uhlan she jumps on
his knee like a kitten… a little white one… and the pan-father and
pan-mother look on and allow it… They allow it… and next day the
Uhlan comes and offers her his hand… . That's how it is… offers her
his hand, he he!" Maximov ended, tittering.

"The pan is a lajdak!"* the tall Pole on the chair growled
suddenly and crossed one leg over the other. Mitya's eye was caught
by his huge greased boot, with its thick, dirty sole. The dress of
both the Poles looked rather greasy.

* Scoundrel.

"Well, now it's lajdak! What's he scolding about?" said
Grushenka, suddenly vexed.

"Pani Agrippina, what the gentleman saw in Poland were servant
girls, and not ladies of good birth," the Pole with the pipe
observed to Grushenka.

"You can reckon on that," the tall Pole snapped
contemptuously.

"What next! Let him talk! People talk, why hinder them? It makes
it cheerful," Grushenka said crossly.

"I'm not hindering them, pani," said the Pole in the wig, with a
long look at Grushenka, and relapsing into dignified silence he
sucked his pipe again.

"No, no. The Polish gentleman spoke the truth." Kalgonov got
excited again, as though it were a question of vast import. "He's
never been in Poland, so how can he talk about it? I suppose you
weren't married in Poland, were you?"
