<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>3<br/>A<br/>Little Demon<br/><br/><br/>GOING in to Lise, he found her half reclining in the<br/>invalid-chair, in which she had been wheeled when she was unable to<br/>walk. She did not move to meet him, but her sharp, keen eyes were<br/>simply riveted on his face. There was a feverish look in her eyes,<br/>her face was pale and yellow. Alyosha was amazed at the change that<br/>had taken place in her in three days. She was positively thinner.<br/>She did not hold out her hand to him. He touched the thin, long<br/>fingers which lay motionless on her dress, then he sat down facing<br/>her, without a word.<br/><br/>"I know you are in a hurry to get to the prison," Lise said<br/>curtly, "and mamma's kept you there for hours; she's just been<br/>telling you about me and Yulia."<br/><br/>"How do you know?" asked Alyosha.<br/><br/>"I've been listening. Why do you stare at me? I want to listen<br/>and I do listen, there's no harm in that. I don't apologise."<br/><br/>"You are upset about something?"<br/><br/>"On the contrary, I am very happy. I've only just been<br/>reflecting for the thirtieth time what a good thing it is I refused<br/>you and shall not be your wife. You are not fit to be a husband. If<br/>I were to marry you and give you a note to take to the man I loved<br/>after you, you'd take it and be sure to give it to him and bring an<br/>answer back, too. If you were forty, you would still go on taking<br/>my love-letters for me."<br/><br/>She suddenly laughed.<br/>
