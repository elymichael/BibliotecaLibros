"Pyotr Alexandrovitch! How could I dare after what's happened!<br/>Forgive me, gentlemen, I was carried away! And upset besides! And,<br/>indeed, I am ashamed. Gentlemen, one man has the heart of Alexander<br/>of Macedon and another the heart of the little dog Fido. Mine is<br/>that of the little dog Fido. I am ashamed! After such an escapade<br/>how can I go to dinner, to gobble up the monastery's sauces? I am<br/>ashamed, I can't. You must excuse me!"<br/><br/>"The devil only knows, what if he deceives us?" thought Miusov,<br/>still hesitating, and watching the retreating buffoon with<br/>distrustful eyes. The latter turned round, and noticing that Miusov<br/>was watching him, waved him a kiss.<br/><br/>"Well, are you coming to the Superior?" Miusov asked Ivan<br/>abruptly.<br/><br/>"Why not? I was especially invited yesterday."<br/><br/>"Unfortunately I feel myself compelled to go to this confounded<br/>dinner," said Miusov with the same irritability, regardless of the<br/>fact that the monk was listening. "We ought, at least, to apologise<br/>for the disturbance, and explain that it was not our doing. What do<br/>you think?"<br/><br/>"Yes, we must explain that it wasn't our doing. Besides, father<br/>won't be there," observed Ivan.<br/><br/>"Well, I should hope not! Confound this dinner!"<br/><br/>They all walked on, however. The monk listened in silence. On<br/>the road through the copse he made one observation however- that<br/>the Father Superior had been waiting a long time, and that they<br/>were more than half an hour late. He received no answer. Miusov<br/>looked with hatred at Ivan.<br/><br/>"Here he is, going to the dinner as though nothing had<br/>happened," he thought. "A brazen face, and the conscience of a<br/>Karamazov!"<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
