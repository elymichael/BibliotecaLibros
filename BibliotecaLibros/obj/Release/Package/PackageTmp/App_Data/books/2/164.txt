"And now on the top of it all, my friend, the best man in the
world is going, is leaving the earth! If you knew, Lise, how bound
up in soul I am with him! And then I shall be left alone… . I shall
come to you, Lise… . For the future we will be together."

"Yes, together, together! Henceforward we shall be always
together, all our lives! Listen, kiss me, I allow you."

Alyosha kissed her.

"Come, now go. Christ be with you!" and she made the sign of the
cross over him. "Make haste back to him while he is alive. I see
I've kept you cruelly. I'll pray to-day for him and you. Alyosha,
we shall be happy! Shall we be happy, shall we?"

"I believe we shall, Lise."

Alyosha thought it better not to go in to Madame Hohlakov and
was going out of the house without saying good-bye to her. But no
sooner had he opened the door than he found Madame Hohlakov
standing before him. From the first word Alyosha guessed that she
had been waiting on purpose to meet him.

"Alexey Fyodorovitch, this is awful. This is all childish
nonsense and ridiculous. I trust you won't dream- It's foolishness,
nothing but foolishness!" she said, attacking him at once.

"Only don't tell her that," said Alyosha, "or she will be upset,
and that's bad for her now."

"Sensible advice from a sensible young man. Am I to understand
that you only agreed with her from compassion for her invalid
state, because you didn't want to irritate her by
contradiction?"

"Oh no, not at all. I was quite serious in what I said," Alyosha
declared stoutly.

"To be serious about it is impossible, unthinkable, and in the
first place I shall never be at home to you again, and I shall take
her away, you may be sure of that."
