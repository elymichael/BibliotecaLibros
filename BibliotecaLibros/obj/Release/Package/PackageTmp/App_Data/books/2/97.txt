Ivan and Alyosha caught the old man and were forcibly bringing
him back.

"Why do you run after him? He'll murder you outright," Ivan
cried wrathfully at his father.

"Ivan! Alyosha! She must be here. Grushenka's here. He said he
saw her himself, running."

He was choking. He was not expecting Grushenka at the time, and
the sudden news that she was here made him beside himself. He was
trembling all over. He seemed frantic.

"But you've seen for yourself that she hasn't come," cried
Ivan.

"But she may have come by that other entrance."

"You know that entrance is locked, and you have the key."

Dmitri suddenly reappeared in the drawing-room. He had, of
course, found the other entrance locked, and the key actually was
in Fyodor Pavlovitch's pocket. The windows of all rooms were also
closed, so Grushenka could not have come in anywhere nor have run
out anywhere.

"Hold him!" shrieked Fyodor Pavlovitch, as soon as he saw him
again. "He's been stealing money in my bedroom." And tearing
himself from Ivan he rushed again at Dmitri. But Dmitri threw up
both hands and suddenly clutched the old man by the two tufts of
hair that remained on his temples, tugged at them, and flung him
with a crash on the floor. He kicked him two or three times with
his heel in the face. The old man moaned shrilly. Ivan, though not
so strong as Dmitri, threw his arms round him, and with all his
might pulled him away. Alyosha helped him with his slender
strength, holding Dmitri in front.

"Madman! You've killed him!" cried Ivan.
