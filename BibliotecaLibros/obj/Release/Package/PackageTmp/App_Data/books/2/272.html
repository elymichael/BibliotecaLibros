<br/>"You must tell me all that afterwards, afterwards!" Madame<br/>Hohlakov with a gesture demanded silence in her turn, "and whatever<br/>you may tell me, I know it all beforehand; I've told you so<br/>already. You ask for a certain sum, for three thousand, but I can<br/>give you more, immeasurably more; I will save you, Dmitri<br/>Fyodorovitch, but you must listen to me."<br/><br/>Mitya started from his seat again.<br/><br/>"Madam, will you really be so good!" he cried, with strong<br/>feeling. "Good God, you've saved me! You have saved a man from a<br/>violent death, from a bulletâ€¦ . My eternal gratitude "I will give<br/>you more, infinitely more than three thousand!" cried Madame<br/>Hohlakov, looking with a radiant smile at Mitya's ecstasy.<br/><br/>"Infinitely?

I've<br/>watched you a hundred times as you've walked past, saying to<br/>myself: That's a man of energy who ought to be at the gold mines.<br/>I've studied your gait and come to the conclusion: that's a man who<br/>would find gold."<br/><br/>"From my gait, madam?" said Mitya, smiling.<br/><br/>"Yes, from your gait. You surely don't deny that character can<br/>be told from the gait, Dmitri Fyodorovitch? Science supports the<br/>idea. I'm all for science and realism now. After all this business<br/>with Father Zossima, which has so upset me, from this very day I'm<br/>a realist and I want to devote myself to practical usefulness. I'm<br/>cured.
