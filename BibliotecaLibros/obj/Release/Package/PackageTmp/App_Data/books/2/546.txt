The prosecutor started like a war-horse at the sound of a
trumpet.

"Let me assure you that I fully believe in the complete
sincerity of your conviction and do not explain it by or identify
it with your affection for your unhappy brother. Your peculiar view
of the whole tragic episode is known to us already from the
preliminary investigation. I won't attempt to conceal from you that
it is highly individual and contradicts all the other evidence
collected by the prosecution. And so I think it essential to press
you to tell me what facts have led you to this conviction of your
brother's innocence and of the guilt of another person against whom
you gave evidence at the preliminary inquiry?"

"I only answered the questions asked me at the preliminary
inquiry," replied Alyosha, slowly and calmly. "I made no accusation
against Smerdyakov of myself."

"Yet you gave evidence against him?"

"I was led to do so by my brother Dmitri's words. I was told
what took place at his arrest and how he had pointed to Smerdyakov
before I was examined. I believe absolutely that my brother is
innocent, and if he didn't commit the murder, then-"

"Then Smerdyakov? Why Smerdyakov? And why are you so completely
persuaded of your brother's innocence?"

"I cannot help believing my brother. I know he wouldn't lie to
me. I saw from his face he wasn't lying."

"Only from his face? Is that all the proof you have?"

"I have no other proof."

"And of Smerdyakov's guilt you have no proof whatever but your
brother's word and the expression of his face?"
