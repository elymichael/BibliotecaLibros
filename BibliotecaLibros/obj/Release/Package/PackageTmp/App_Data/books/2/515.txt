Ivan stepped up to the table, took up the roll of paper and
began unfolding it, but suddenly drew back his fingers, as though
from contact with a loathsome reptile.

"Your hands keep twitching," observed Smerdyakov, and he
deliberately unfolded the bundle himself. Under the wrapper were
three packets of hundred-rouble notes.

"They are all here, all the three thousand roubles; you need not
count them. Take them," Smerdyakov suggested to Ivan, nodding at
the notes. Ivan sank back in his chair. He was as white as a
handkerchief.

"You frightened meâ€¦ with your stocking," he said, with a strange
grin.

"Can you really not have known till now?" Smerdyakov asked once
more.

"No, I did not know. I kept thinking of Dmitri. Brother,
brother! Ach!" He suddenly clutched his head in both hands.

"Listen. Did you kill him alone? With my brother's help or
without?"

"It was only with you, with your help, I killed him, and Dmitri
Fyodorovitch is quite innocent."

"All right, all right. Talk about me later. Why do I keep on
trembling? I can't speak properly."

"You were bold enough then. You said 'everything was lawful,'
and how frightened you are now," Smerdyakov muttered in surprise.
"Won't you have some lemonade? I'll ask for some at once. It's very
refreshing. Only I must hide this first."

And again he motioned at the notes. He was just going to get up
and call at the door to Marya Kondratyevna to make some lemonade
and bring it them, but, looking for something to cover up the notes
that she might not see them, he first took out his handkerchief,
and as it turned out to be very dirty, took up the big yellow book
that Ivan had noticed at first lying on the table, and put it over
the notes. The book was The Sayings of the Holy Father Isaac the
Syrian. Ivan read it mechanically.
