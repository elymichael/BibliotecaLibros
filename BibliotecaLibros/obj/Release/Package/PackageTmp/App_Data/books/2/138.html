"Four days, what nonsense! Listen. Did you laugh at me very<br/>much?"<br/><br/>"I didn't laugh at all."<br/><br/>"Why not?"<br/><br/>"Because I believed all you said."<br/><br/>"You are insulting me!"<br/><br/>"Not at all. As soon as I read it, I thought that all that would<br/>come to pass, for as soon as Father Zossima dies, I am to leave the<br/>monastery. Then I shall go back and finish my studies, and when you<br/>reach the legal age we will be married. I shall love you. Though I<br/>haven't had time to think about it, I believe I couldn't find a<br/>better wife than you, and Father Zossima tells me I must<br/>marry."<br/><br/>"But I am a cripple, wheeled about in a chair," laughed Lise,<br/>flushing crimson.<br/><br/>"I'll wheel you about myself, but I'm sure you'll get well by<br/>then."<br/><br/>"But you are mad," said Lise, nervously, "to make all this<br/>nonsense out of a joke! Here's mamma, very a propos, perhaps.<br/>Mamma, how slow you always are, how can you be so long! And here's<br/>Yulia with the ice!<br/><br/>"Oh, Lise, don't scream, above all things don't scream. That<br/>scream drives meâ€¦ How can I help it when you put the lint in<br/>another place? I've been hunting and hunting- I do believe you did<br/>it on purpose."<br/><br/>"But I couldn't tell that he would come with a bad finger, or<br/>else perhaps I might have done it on purpose. My darling mamma, you<br/>begin to say really witty things."<br/>
