<br/>"Blessed man! Give me your hand to kiss."<br/><br/>Fyodor Pavlovitch skipped up, and imprinted a rapid kiss on the<br/>elder's thin hand. "It is, it is pleasant to take offence. You said<br/>that so well, as I never heard it before. Yes, I have been all my<br/>life taking offence, to please myself, taking offence on aesthetic<br/>grounds, for it is not so much pleasant as distinguished sometimes<br/>to be insulted- that you had forgotten, great elder, it is<br/>distinguished! I shall make a note of that. But I have been lying,<br/>lying positively my whole life long, every day and hour of it. Of a<br/>truth, I am a lie, and the father of lies. Though I believe I am<br/>not the father of lies. I am getting mixed in my texts. Say, the<br/>son of lies, and that will be enough. Only… my angel… may sometimes<br/>talk about Diderot! Diderot will do no harm, though sometimes a<br/>word will do harm. Great elder, by the way, I was forgetting,<br/>though I had been meaning for the last two years to come here on<br/>purpose to ask and to find out something. Only do tell Pyotr<br/>Alexandrovitch not to interrupt me. Here is my question: Is it<br/>true, great Father, that the story is told somewhere in the Lives<br/>of the Saints of a holy saint martyred for his faith who, when his<br/>head was cut off at last, stood up, picked up his head, and,<br/>'courteously kissing it,' walked a long way, carrying it in his<br/>hands. Is that true or not, honoured Father?"<br/><br/>"No, it is untrue," said the elder.<br/><br/>"There is nothing of the kind in all the lives of the saints.<br/>What saint do you say the story is told of?" asked the Father<br/>Librarian.<br/><br/>"I do not know what saint. I do not know, and can't tell. I was<br/>deceived. I was told the story. I had heard it, and do you know who<br/>told it? Pyotr Alexandrovitch Miusov here, was so angry just now<br/>about Diderot. He it was who told the story."<br/><br/>"I have never told it you, I never speak to you at all."<br/><br/>"It is true you did not tell me, but you told it when I was<br/>present. It was three years ago. I mentioned it because by that<br/>ridiculous story you shook my faith, Pyotr Alexandrovitch. You knew<br/>nothing of it, but I went home with my faith shaken, and I have<br/>been getting more and more shaken ever since. Yes, Pyotr<br/>Alexandrovitch, you were the cause of a great fall. That was not a<br/>Diderot!<br/><br/>Fyodor Pavlovitch got excited and pathetic, though it was<br/>perfectly clear to everyone by now that he was playing a part<br/>again. Yet Miusov was stung by his words.<br/><br/>"What nonsense, and it is all nonsense," he muttered. "I may<br/>really have told it, some time or other… but not to you. I was told<br/>it myself. I heard it in Paris from a Frenchman. He told me it was<br/>read at our mass from the Lives of the Saints… he was a very<br/>learned man who had made a special study of Russian statistics and<br/>had lived a long time in Russia… . I have not read the Lives of the<br/>Saints myself, and I am not going to read them… all sorts of things<br/>are said at dinner- we were dining then."<br/><br/>"Yes, you were dining then, and so I lost my faith!" said Fyodor<br/>Pavlovitch, mimicking him.<br/><br/>
