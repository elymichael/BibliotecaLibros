These were the very words of the old profligate, who felt
already that his death was not far off and who actually died five
months later.

I will note too, in passing- that although many in our town knew
of the grotesque and monstrous rivalry of the Karamazovs, father
and son, the object of which was Grushenka, scarcely anyone
understood what really underlay her attitude to both of them. Even
Grushenka's two servants (after the catastrophe of which we will
speak later) testified in court that she received Dmitri
Fyodorovitch simply from fear because "he threatened to murder
her." These servants were an old cook, invalidish and almost deaf,
who came from Grushenka's old home, and her granddaughter, a smart
young girl of twenty, who performed the duties of a maid. Grushenka
lived very economically and her surroundings were anything but
luxurious. Her lodge consisted of three rooms furnished with
mahogany furniture in the fashion of 1820, belonging to her
landlady.

It was quite dark when Rakitin and Alyosha entered her rooms,
yet they were not lighted up. Grushenka was lying down in her
drawing-room on the big, hard, clumsy sofa, with a mahogany back.
The sofa was covered with shabby and ragged leather. Under her head
she had two white down pillows taken from her bed. She was lying
stretched out motionless on her back with her hands behind her
head. She was dressed as though expecting someone, in a black silk
dress, with a dainty lace fichu on her head, which was very
becoming. Over her shoulders was thrown a lace shawl pinned with a
massive gold brooch. She certainly was expecting someone. She lay
as though impatient and weary, her face rather pale and her lips
and eyes hot, restlessly tapping the arm of the sofa with the tip
of her right foot. The appearance of Rakitin and Alyosha caused a
slight excitement. From the hall they could hear Grushenka leap up
from the sofa and cry out in a frightened voice, "Who's there?" But
the maid met the visitors and at once called back to her
mistress.

"It's not he, it's nothing, only other visitors."

"What can be the matter?" muttered Rakitin, leading Alyosha into
the drawing-room.

Grushenka was standing by the sofa as though still alarmed. A
thick coil of her dark brown hair escaped from its lace covering
and fell on her right shoulder, but she did not notice it and did
not put it back till she had gazed at her visitors and recognised
them.

"Ah, it's you, Rakitin? You quite frightened me. Whom have you
brought? Who is this with you? Good heavens, you have brought him!"
she exclaimed, recognising Alyosha.

"Do send for candles!" said Rakitin, with the free-and-easy air
of a most intimate friend, who is privileged to give orders in the
house.

"Candles… of course, candles… . Fenya, fetch him a candle… .
Well, you have chosen a moment to bring him! she exclaimed again,
nodding towards Alyosha, and turning to the looking-glass she began
quickly fastening up her hair with both hands. She seemed
displeased.

"Haven't I managed to please you?" asked Rakitin, instantly
almost offended.
