"Here I've written you a love-letter. Oh, dear, what have I
done? Alyosha, don't despise me, and if I've done something very
horrid and wounded you, forgive me. Now the secret of my
reputation, ruined perhaps for ever, is in your hands.

"I shall certainly cry to-day. Good-bye till our meeting, our
awful meeting.- Lise.

"P.S.- Alyosha! You must, must, must come!- Lise.

Alyosha read the note in amazement, read it through twice,
thought a little, and suddenly laughed a soft, sweet laugh. He
started. That laugh seemed to him sinful. But a minute later he
laughed again just as softly and happily. He slowly replaced the
note in the envelope, crossed himself and lay down. The agitation
in his heart passed at once. "God, have mercy upon all of them,
have all these unhappy and turbulent souls in Thy keeping, and set
them in the right path. All ways are Thine. Save them according to
Thy wisdom. Thou art love. Thou wilt send joy to all!" Alyosha
murmured, crossing himself, and falling into peaceful sleep.
