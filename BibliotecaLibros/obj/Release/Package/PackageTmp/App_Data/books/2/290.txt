"I'm loading the pistol."

Unfastening the pistol-case, Mitya actually opened the powder
horn, and carefully sprinkled and rammed in the charge. Then he
took the bullet and, before inserting it, held it in two fingers in
front of the candle.

"Why are you looking at the bullet?" asked Pyotr Ilyitch,
watching him with uneasy curiosity.

"Oh, a fancy. Why, if you meant to put that bullet in your
brain, would you look at it or not?"

"Why look at it?"

"It's going into my brain, so it's interesting to look and see
what it's like. But that's foolishness, a moment's foolishness. Now
that's done," he added, putting in the bullet and driving it home
with the ramrod. "Pyotr Ilyitch, my dear fellow, that's nonsense,
all nonsense, and if only you knew what nonsense! Give me a little
piece of paper now."

"Here's some paper."

"No, a clean new piece, writing-paper. That's right."

And taking a pen from the table, Mitya rapidly wrote two lines,
folded the paper in four, and thrust it in his waistcoat pocket. He
put the pistols in the case, locked it up, and kept it in his hand.
Then he looked at Pyotr Ilyitch with a slow, thoughtful smile.

"Now, let's go."

"Where are we going? No, wait a minuteâ€¦ . Are you thinking of
putting that bullet in your brain, perhaps?" Pyotr Ilyitch asked
uneasily.
