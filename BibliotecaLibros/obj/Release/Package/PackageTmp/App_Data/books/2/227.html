<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>1<br/>The Breath of Corruption<br/><br/><br/>THE body of Father Zossima was prepared for burial according to<br/>the established Ritual. As is well known, the bodies of dead monks<br/>and hermits are not washed. In the words of the Church Ritual: "If<br/>any one of the monks depart in the Lord, the monk designated (that<br/>is, whose office it is) shall wipe the body with warm water, making<br/>first the sign of the cross with a sponge on the forehead of the<br/>deceased, on the breast, on the hands and feet and on the knees,<br/>and that is enough." All this was done by Father Paissy, who then<br/>clothed the deceased in his monastic garb and wrapped him in his<br/>cloak, which was, according to custom, somewhat slit to allow of<br/>its being folded about him in the form of a cross. On his head he<br/>put a hood with an eight-cornered cross. The hood was left open and<br/>the dead man's face was covered with black gauze. In his hands was<br/>put an ikon of the Saviour. Towards morning he was put in the<br/>coffin which had been made ready long before. It was decided to<br/>leave the coffin all day in the cell, in the larger room in which<br/>the elder used to receive his visitors and fellow monks. As the<br/>deceased was a priest and monk of the strictest rule, the Gospel,<br/>not the Psalter, had to be read over his body by monks in holy<br/>orders. The reading was begun by Father Iosif immediately after the<br/>requiem service. Father Paissy desired later on to read the Gospel<br/>all day and night over his dead friend, but for the present he, as<br/>well as the Father Superintendent of the Hermitage, was very busy<br/>and occupied, for something extraordinary, an unheard-of, even<br/>"unseemly" excitement and impatient expectation began to be<br/>apparent in the monks, and the visitors from the monastery hostels,<br/>and the crowds of people flocking from the town. And as time went<br/>on, this grew more and more marked. Both the Superintendent and<br/>Father Paissy did their utmost to calm the general bustle and<br/>agitation.<br/><br/>When it was fully daylight, some people began bringing their<br/>sick, in most cases children, with them from the town- as though<br/>they had been waiting expressly for this moment to do so, evidently<br/>persuaded that the dead elder's remains had a power of healing,<br/>which would be immediately made manifest in accordance with their<br/>faith. It was only then apparent how unquestionably everyone in our<br/>town had accepted Father Zossima during his lifetime as a great<br/>saint. And those who came were far from being all of the humbler<br/>classes.<br/><br/>This intense expectation on the part of believers displayed with<br/>such haste, such openness, even with impatience and almost<br/>insistence, impressed Father Paissy as unseemly. Though he had long<br/>foreseen something of the sort, the actual manifestation of the<br/>feeling was beyond anything he had looked for. When he came across<br/>any of the monks who displayed this excitement, Father Paissy began<br/>to reprove them. "Such immediate expectation of something<br/>extraordinary," he said, "shows a levity, possible to worldly<br/>people but unseemly in us."<br/><br/>But little attention was paid him and Father Paissy noticed it<br/>uneasily. Yet he himself (if the whole truth must be told),<br/>secretly at the bottom of his heart, cherished almost the same<br/>hopes and could not but be aware of it, though he was indignant at<br/>the too impatient expectation around him, and saw in it<br/>light-mindedness and vanity. Nevertheless, it was particularly<br/>unpleasant to him to meet certain persons, whose presence aroused<br/>in him great misgivings. In the crowd in the dead man's cell he<br/>noticed with inward aversion (for which he immediately reproached<br/>himself) the presence of Rakitin and of the monk from Obdorsk, who<br/>was still staying in the monastery. Of both of them Father Paissy<br/>felt for some reason suddenly suspicious- though, indeed, he might<br/>well have felt the same about others.<br/><br/>The monk from Obdorsk was conspicuous as the most fussy in the<br/>excited crowd. He was to be seen everywhere; everywhere he was<br/>asking questions, everywhere he was listening, on all sides he was<br/>whispering with a peculiar, mysterious air. His expression showed<br/>the greatest impatience and even a sort of irritation.<br/><br/>As for Rakitin, he, as appeared later, had come so early to the<br/>hermitage at the special request of Madame Hohlakov. As soon as<br/>that good-hearted but weak-minded woman, who could not herself have<br/>been admitted to the hermitage, waked and heard of the death of<br/>Father Zossima, she was overtaken with such intense curiosity that<br/>she promptly despatched Rakitin to the hermitage, to keep a careful<br/>look out and report to her by letter ever half hour or so<br/>"everything that takes place." She regarded Rakitin as a most<br/>religious and devout young man. He was particularly clever in<br/>getting round people and assuming whatever part he thought most to<br/>their taste, if he detected the slightest advantage to himself from<br/>doing so.<br/><br/>It was a bright, clear day, and many of the visitors were<br/>thronging about the tombs, which were particularly numerous round<br/>the church and scattered here and there about the hermitage. As he<br/>walked round the hermitage, Father Paissy remembered Alyosha and<br/>that he had not seen him for some time, not since the night. And he<br/>had no sooner thought of him than he at once noticed him in the<br/>farthest corner of the hermitage garden, sitting on the tombstone<br/>of a monk who had been famous long ago for his saintliness. He sat<br/>with his back to the hermitage and his face to the wall, and seemed<br/>to be hiding behind the tombstone. Going up to him, Father Paissy<br/>saw that he was weeping quietly but bitterly, with his face hidden<br/>in his hands, and that his whole frame was shaking with sobs.<br/>Father Paissy stood over him for a little.<br/>
