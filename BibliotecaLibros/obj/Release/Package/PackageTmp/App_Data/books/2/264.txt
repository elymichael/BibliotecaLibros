Mitya at once began talking to him, too, of his plans, nervously
and excitedly asking advice in regard to Lyagavy, and talking all
the way. The priest listened attentively, but gave little advice.
He turned off Mitya's questions with: "I don't know. Ah, I can't
say. How can I tell?" and so on. When Mitya began to speak of his
quarrel with his father over his inheritance, the priest was
positively alarmed, as he was in some way dependent on Fyodor
Pavlovitch. He inquired, however, with surprise, why he called the
peasant-trader Gorstkin, Lyagavy, and obligingly explained to Mitya
that, though the man's name really was Lyagavy, he was never called
so, as he would be grievously offended at the name, and that he
must be sure to call him Gorstkin, "or you'll do nothing with him;
he won't even listen to you," said the priest in conclusion.

Mitya was somewhat surprised for a moment, and explained that
that was what Samsonov had called him. On hearing this fact, the
priest dropped the subject, though he would have done well to put
into words his doubt whether, if Samsonov had sent him to that
peasant, calling him Lyagavy, there was not something wrong about
it and he was turning him into ridicule. But Mitya had no time to
pause over such trifles. He hurried, striding along, and only when
he reached Suhoy Possyolok did he realise that they had come not
one verst, nor one and a half, but at least three. This annoyed
him, but he controlled himself.

They went into the hut. The forester lived in one half of the
hut, and Gorstkin was lodging in the other, the better room the
other side of the passage. They went into that room and lighted a
tallow candle. The hut was extremely overheated. On the table there
was a samovar that had gone out, a tray with cups, an empty rum
bottle, a bottle of vodka partly full, and some half-eaten crusts
of wheaten bread. The visitor himself lay stretched at full length
on the bench, with his coat crushed up under his head for a pillow,
snoring heavily. Mitya stood in perplexity.

"Of course, I must wake him. My business is too important. I've
come in such haste. I'm in a hurry to get back to-day," he said in
great agitation. But the priest and the forester stood in silence,
not giving their opinion. Mitya went up and began trying to wake
him himself; he tried vigorously, but the sleeper did not wake.

"He's drunk," Mitya decided. "Good Lord! What am I to do? What
am I to do?" And, terribly impatient, he began pulling him by the
arms, by the legs, shaking his head, lifting him up and making him
sit on the bench. Yet, after prolonged exertions, he could only
succeed in getting the drunken man to utter absurd grunts, and
violent, but inarticulate oaths.

"No, you'd better wait a little," the priest pronounced at last,
"for he's obviously not in a fit state."

"He's been drinking the whole day," the forester chimed in.

"Good heavens!" cried Mitya. "If only you knew how important it
is to me and how desperate I am!"

"No, you'd better wait till morning," the priest repeated.

"Till morning? Mercy! that's impossible!" And in his despair he
was on the point of attacking the sleeping man again, but stopped
short at once, realising the uselessness of his efforts. The priest
said nothing, the sleepy forester looked gloomy.
