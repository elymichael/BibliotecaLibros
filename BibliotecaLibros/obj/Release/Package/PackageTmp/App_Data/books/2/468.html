<br/>"I'll tell you. This Katya… Ah! she is a charming, charming<br/>creature, only I never can make out who it is she is in love with.<br/>She was with me some time ago and I couldn't get anything out of<br/>her. Especially as she won't talk to me except on the surface now.<br/>She is always talking about my health and nothing else, and she<br/>takes up such a tone with me, too. I simply said to myself, 'Well<br/>so be it. I don't care'… Oh, yes. I was talking of aberration. This<br/>doctor has come. You know a doctor has come? Of course, you know<br/>it- the one who discovers madmen. You wrote for him. No, it wasn't<br/>you, but Katya. It's all Katya's doing. Well, you see, a man may be<br/>sitting perfectly sane and suddenly have an aberration. He may be<br/>conscious and know what he is doing and yet be in a state of<br/>aberration. And there's no doubt that Dmitri Fyodorovitch was<br/>suffering from aberration. They found out about aberration as soon<br/>as the law courts were reformed. It's all the good effect of the<br/>reformed law courts. The doctor has been here and questioned me<br/>about that evening, about the gold mines. 'How did he seem then?'<br/>he asked me. He must have been in a state of aberration. He came in<br/>shouting, 'Money, money, three thousand! Give me three thousand!'<br/>and then went away and immediately did the murder. 'I don't want to<br/>murder him,' he said, and he suddenly went and murdered him. That's<br/>why they'll acquit him, because he struggled against it and yet he<br/>murdered him."<br/><br/>"But he didn't murder him," Alyosha interrupted rather sharply.<br/>He felt more and more sick with anxiety and impatience.<br/><br/>"Yes, I know it was that old man Grigory murdered him."<br/><br/>"Grigory?" cried Alyosha.<br/><br/>"Yes, yes; it was Grigory. He lay as Dmitri Fyodorovitch struck<br/>him down, and then got up, saw the door open, went in and killed<br/>Fyodor Pavlovitch."<br/><br/>"But why, why?"<br/><br/>"Suffering from aberration. When he recovered from the blow<br/>Dmitri Fyodorovitch gave him on the head, he was suffering from<br/>aberration: he went and committed the murder. As for his saying he<br/>didn't, he very likely doesn't remember. Only, you know, it'll be<br/>better, ever so much better, if Dmitri Fyodorovitch murdered him.<br/>And that's how it must have been, though I say it was Grigory. It<br/>certainly was Dmitri Fyodorovitch, and that's better, ever so much<br/>better! Oh! not better that a son should have killed his father, I<br/>don't defend that. Children ought to honour their parents, and yet<br/>it would be better if it were he, as you'd have nothing to cry over<br/>then, for he did it when he was unconscious or rather when he was<br/>conscious, but did not know what he was doing. Let them acquit him-<br/>that's so humane, and would show what a blessing reformed law<br/>courts are. I knew nothing about it, but they say they have been so<br/>a long time. And when I heard it yesterday, I was so struck by it<br/>that I wanted to send for you at once. And if he is acquitted, make<br/>him come straight from the law courts to dinner with me, and I'll<br/>have a party of friends, and we'll drink to the reformed law<br/>courts. I don't believe he'd be dangerous; besides, I'll invite a<br/>great many friends, so that he could always be led out if he did<br/>anything. And then he might be made a justice of the peace or<br/>something in another town, for those who have been in trouble<br/>themselves make the best judges. And, besides, who isn't suffering<br/>from aberration nowadays?- you, I, all of us, are in a state of<br/>aberration, and there are ever so many examples of it: a man sits<br/>singing a song, suddenly something annoys him, he takes a pistol<br/>and shoots the first person he comes across, and no one blames him<br/>for it. I read that lately, and all the doctors confirm it. The<br/>doctors are always confirming; they confirm,- anything. Why, my<br/>Lise is in a state of aberration. She made me cry again yesterday,<br/>and the day before, too, and to-day I suddenly realised that it's<br/>all due to aberration. Oh, Lise grieves me so! I believe she's<br/>quite mad. Why did she send for you? Did she send for you or did<br/>you come of yourself?"<br/><br/>"Yes, she sent for me, and I am just going to her." Alyosha got<br/>up resolutely.<br/><br/>"Oh, my dear, dear Alexey Fyodorovitch, perhaps that's what's<br/>most important," Madame Hohlakov cried, suddenly bursting into<br/>tears. "God knows I trust Lise to you with all my heart, and it's<br/>no matter her sending for you on the sly, without telling her<br/>mother. But forgive me, I can't trust my daughter so easily to your<br/>brother Ivan Fyodorovitch, though I still consider him the most<br/>chivalrous young man. But only fancy, he's been to see Lise and I<br/>knew nothing about it!"<br/><br/>"How? What? When?" Alyosha was exceedingly surprised. He had not<br/>sat down again and listened standing.<br/><br/>
