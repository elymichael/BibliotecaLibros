<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>6<br/>Smerdyakov<br/><br/><br/>HE did in fact find his father still at table. Though there was<br/>a dining-room in the house, the table was laid as usual in the<br/>drawing room, which was the largest room, and furnished with<br/>old-fashioned ostentation. The furniture was white and very old,<br/>upholstered in old, red, silky material. In the spaces between the<br/>windows there were mirrors in elaborate white and gilt frames, of<br/>old-fashioned carving. On the walls, covered with white paper,<br/>which was torn in many places, there hung two large portraits- one<br/>of some prince who had been governor of the district thirty years<br/>before, and the other of some bishop, also long since dead. In the<br/>corner opposite the door there were several ikons, before which a<br/>lamp was lighted at nightfall… not so much for devotional purposes<br/>as to light the room. Fyodor Pavlovitch used to go to bed very<br/>late, at three or four o'clock in the morning,and would wander<br/>about the room at night or sit in an armchair, thinking. This had<br/>become a habit with him. He often slept quite alone in the house,<br/>sending his servants to the lodge; but usually Smerdyakov remained,<br/>sleeping on a bench in the hall.<br/><br/>When Alyosha came in, dinner was over, but coffee and preserves<br/>had been served. Fyodor Pavlovitch liked sweet things with brandy<br/>after dinner. Ivan was also at table, sipping coffee. The servants,<br/>Grigory and Smerdyakov, were standing by. Both the gentlemen and<br/>the servants seemed in singularly good spirits. Fyodor Pavlovitch<br/>was roaring with laughter. Before he entered the room, Alyosha<br/>heard the shrill laugh he knew so well, and could tell from the<br/>sound of it that his father had only reached the good-humoured<br/>stage, and was far from being completely drunk.<br/><br/>"Here he is! Here he is!" yelled Fyodor Pavlovitch, highly<br/>delighted at seeing Alyosha. "Join us. Sit down. Coffee is a lenten<br/>dish, but it's hot and good. I don't offer you brandy, you're<br/>keeping the fast. But would you like some? No; I'd better give you<br/>some of our famous liqueur. Smerdyakov, go to the cupboard, the<br/>second shelf on the right. Here are the keys. Look sharp!"<br/><br/>Alyosha began refusing the liqueur.<br/><br/>"Never mind. If you won't have it, we will," said Fyodor<br/>Pavlovitch, beaming. "But stay- have you dined?"<br/><br/>"Yes," answered Alyosha, who had in truth only eaten a piece of<br/>bread and drunk a glass of kvass in the Father Superior's kitchen.<br/>"Though I should be pleased to have some hot coffee."<br/><br/>"Bravo, my darling! He'll have some coffee. Does it want<br/>warming? No, it's boiling. It's capital coffee: Smerdyakov's<br/>making. My Smerdyakov's an artist at coffee and at fish patties,<br/>and at fish soup, too. You must come one day and have some fish<br/>soup. Let me know beforehand… . But, stay; didn't I tell you this<br/>morning to come home with your mattress and pillow and all? Have<br/>you brought your mattress? He he he!"<br/>
