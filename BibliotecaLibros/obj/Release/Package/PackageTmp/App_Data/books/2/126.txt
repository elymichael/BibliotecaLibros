"How cross you are! It's because of yesterday; you had better
lie down," said Alyosha.

"There! you say that," the old man observed suddenly, as though
it had struck him for the first time, "and I am not angry with you.
But if Ivan said it, I should be angry with him. It is only with
you I have good moments, else you know I am an ill-natured
man."

"You are not ill-natured, but distorted," said Alyosha with a
smile.

"Listen. I meant this morning to get that ruffian Mitya locked
up and I don't know now what I shall decide about it. Of course in
these fashionable days fathers and mothers are looked upon as a
prejudice, but even now the law does not allow you to drag your old
father about by the hair, to kick him in the face in his own house,
and brag of murdering him outright- all in the presence of
witnesses. If I liked, I could crush him and could have him locked
up at once for what he did yesterday."

"Then you don't mean to take proceedings?"

"Ivan has dissuaded me. I shouldn't care about Ivan, but there's
another thing."

And bending down to Alyosha, he went on in a confidential
half-whisper.

"If I send the ruffian to prison, she'll hear of it and run to
see him at once. But if she hears that he has beaten me, a weak old
man, within an inch of my life, she may give him up and come to meâ€¦
For that's her way, everything by contraries. I know her through
and through! Won't you have a drop of brandy? Take some cold coffee
and I'll pour a quarter of a glass of brandy into it, it's
delicious, my boy."

"No, thank you. I'll take that roll with me if I may," said
Alyosha, and taking a halfpenny French roll he put it in the pocket
of his cassock. "And you'd better not have brandy, either," he
suggested apprehensively, looking into the old man's face.

"You are quite right, it irritates my nerves instead of soothing
them. Only one little glass. I'll get it out of the cupboard."

He unlocked the cupboard, poured out a glass, drank it, then
locked the cupboard and put the key back in his pocket.
