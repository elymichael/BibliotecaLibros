The old man fairly fluttered with joy, as though nothing more
comforting could have been said to him. In his delight he seized
Alyosha's hand and pressed it warmly to his heart. Tears positively
glittered in his eyes.

"That image of the Mother of God of which I was telling you just
now," he said. "Take it home and keep it for yourself. And I'll let
you go back to the monastery… . I was joking this morning, don't be
angry with me. My head aches, Alyosha… . Alyosha, comfort my heart.
Be an angel and tell me the truth!"

"You're still asking whether she has been here or not?" Alyosha
said sorrowfully.

"No, no, no. I believe you. I'll tell you what it is: you go to
Grushenka yourself, or see her somehow; make haste and ask her; see
for yourself, which she means to choose, him or me. Eh? What? Can
you?"

"If I see her I'll ask her," Alyosha muttered, embarrassed.

"No, she won't tell you," the old man interrupted, "she's a
rogue. She'll begin kissing you and say that it's you she wants.
She's a deceitful, shameless hussy. You mustn't go to her, you
mustn't!"

"No father, and it wouldn't be suitable, it wouldn't be right at
all."

"Where was he sending you just now? He shouted 'Go' as he ran
away."

"For money? To ask her for money?"

"No. Not for money."
