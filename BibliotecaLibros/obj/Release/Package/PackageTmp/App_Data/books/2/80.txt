"Mitya, you are unhappy, yes! But not as unhappy as you think.
Don't worry yourself to death with despair."

"What, do you suppose I'd shoot myself because I can't get three
thousand to pay back? That's just it. I shan't shoot myself. I
haven't the strength now. Afterwards, perhaps. But now I'm going to
Grushenka. I don't care what happens."

"And what then?"

"I'll be her husband if she deigns to have me, and when lovers
come, I'll go into the next room. I'll clean her friends' goloshes,
blow up their samovar, run their errands."

"Katerina Ivanovna will understand it all," Alyosha said
solemnly. "She'll understand how great this trouble is and will
forgive. She has a lofty mind, and no one could be more unhappy
than you. She'll see that for herself."

"She won't forgive everything," said Dmitri, with a grin.
"There's something in it, brother, that no woman could forgive. Do
you know what would be the best thing to do?"

"What?"

"Pay back the three thousand."

"Where can we get it from? I say, I have two thousand. Ivan will
give you another thousand- that makes three. Take it and pay it
back."

"And when would you get it, your three thousand? You're not of
age, besides, and you must- you absolutely must- take my farewell
to her to-day, with the money or without it, for I can't drag on
any longer, things have come to such a pass. To-morrow is too late.
I shall send you to father."
