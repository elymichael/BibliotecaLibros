Again Alyosha seemed not to hear. Rakitin could not control
himself.

"Well, so you've saved the sinner?" he laughed spitefully. "Have
you turned the Magdalene into the true path? Driven out the seven
devils, eh? So you see the miracles you were looking out for just
now have come to pass!"

"Hush, Rakitin," Alyosha, answered with an aching heart.

"So you despise me now for those twenty-five roubles? I've sold
my friend, you think. But you are not Christ, you know, and I am
not Judas."

"Oh, Rakitin, I assure you I'd forgotten about it," cried
Alyosha, "you remind me of it yourselfâ€¦ "

But this was the last straw for Rakitin.

"Damnation take you all and each of you" he cried suddenly, "why
the devil did I take you up? I don't want to know you from this
time forward. Go alone, there's your road!" And he turned abruptly
into another street, leaving Alyosha alone in the dark. Alyosha
came out of the town and walked across the fields to the
monastery.
