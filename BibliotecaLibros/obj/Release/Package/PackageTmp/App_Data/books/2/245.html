"You see, Alyosha," Grushenka turned to him with a nervous<br/>laugh. "I was boasting when I told Rakitin I had given away an<br/>onion, but it's not to boast I tell you about it. It's only a<br/>story, but it's a nice story. I used to hear it when I was a child<br/>from Matryona, my cook, who is still with me. It's like this. Once<br/>upon a time there was a peasant woman and a very wicked woman she<br/>was. And she died and did not leave a single good deed behind. The<br/>devils caught her and plunged her into the lake of fire. So her<br/>guardian angel stood and wondered what good deed of hers he could<br/>remember to tell to God; 'She once pulled up an onion in her<br/>garden,' said he, 'and gave it to a beggar woman.' And God<br/>answered: 'You take that onion then, hold it out to her in the<br/>lake, and let her take hold and be pulled out. And if you can pull<br/>her out of the lake, let her come to Paradise, but if the onion<br/>breaks, then the woman must stay where she is.' The angel ran to<br/>the woman and held out the onion to her. 'Come,' said he, 'catch<br/>hold and I'll pull you out.' he began cautiously pulling her out.<br/>He had just pulled her right out, when the other sinners in the<br/>lake, seeing how she was being drawn out, began catching hold of<br/>her so as to be pulled out with her. But she was a very wicked<br/>woman and she began kicking them. 'I'm to be pulled out, not you.<br/>It's my onion, not yours.' As soon as she said that, the onion<br/>broke. And the woman fell into the lake and she is burning there to<br/>this day. So the angel wept and went away. So that's the story,<br/>Alyosha; I know it by heart, for I am that wicked woman myself. I<br/>boasted to Rakitin that I had given away an onion, but to you I'll<br/>say: 'I've done nothing but give away one onion all my life, that's<br/>the only good deed I've done.' don't praise me, Alyosha, don't<br/>think me good, I am bad, I am a wicked woman and you make me<br/>ashamed if you praise me. Eh, I must confess everything. Listen,<br/>Alyosha. I was so anxious to get hold of you that I promised<br/>Rakitin twenty-five roubles if he would bring you to me. Stay,<br/>Rakitin, wait!"<br/><br/>She went with rapid steps to the table, opened a drawer, pulled<br/>out a purse and took from it a twenty-five rouble note.<br/><br/>"What nonsense! What nonsense!" cried Rakitin, disconcerted.<br/><br/>"Take it. Rakitin, I owe it you, there's no fear of your<br/>refusing it, you asked for it yourself." And she threw the note to<br/>him.<br/><br/>"Likely I should refuse it," boomed Rakitin, obviously abashed,<br/>but carrying off his confusion with a swagger. "That will come in<br/>very handy; fools are made for wise men's profit."<br/><br/>"And now hold your tongue, Rakitin, what I am going to say now<br/>is not for your ears. Sit down in that corner and keep quiet. You<br/>don't like us, so hold your tongue."<br/><br/>"What should I like you for?" Rakitin snarled, not concealing<br/>his ill-humour. He put the twenty-five rouble note in his pocket<br/>and he felt ashamed at Alyosha's seeing it. He had reckoned on<br/>receiving his payment later, without Alyosha's knowing of it, and<br/>now, feeling ashamed, he lost his temper. Till that moment he had<br/>thought it discreet not to contradict Grushenka too flatly in spite<br/>of her snubbing, since he had something to get out of her. But now<br/>he, too, was angry:<br/><br/>"One loves people for some reason, but what have either of you<br/>done for me?"<br/><br/>"You should love people without a reason, as Alyosha does."<br/><br/>"How does he love you? How has he shown it, that you make such a<br/>fuss about it?"<br/><br/>Grushenka was standing in the middle of the room; she spoke with<br/>heat and there were hysterical notes in her voice.<br/>
