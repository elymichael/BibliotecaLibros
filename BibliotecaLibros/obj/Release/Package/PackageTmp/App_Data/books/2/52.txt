"Ah, an irreverent expression! Well, what of it? Anyway, what
does that vision mean?"

"I don't know what it means, Misha."

"I knew he wouldn't explain it to you There's nothing wonderful
about it, of course, only the usual holy mummery. But there was an
object in the performance. All the pious people in the town will
talk about it and spread the story through the province, wondering
what it meant. To my thinking the old man really has a keen nose;
he sniffed a crime. Your house stinks of it."

Rakitin evidently had something he was eager to speak of.

"It'll be in your family, this crime. Between your brothers and
your rich old father. So Father Zossima flopped down to be ready
for what may turn up. If something happens later on, it'll be: 'Ah,
the holy man foresaw it, prophesied it!' though it's a poor sort of
prophecy, flopping like that. 'Ah, but it was symbolic,' they'll
say, 'an allegory,' and the devil knows what all! It'll be
remembered to his glory: 'He predicted the crime and marked the
criminal!' That's always the way with these crazy fanatics; they
cross themselves at the tavern and throw stones at the temple. Like
your elder, he takes a stick to a just man and falls at the feet of
a murderer."

"What crime? What do you mean?"

Alyosha stopped dead. Rakitin stopped, too.

"What murderer? As though you didn't know! I'll bet you've
thought of it before. That's interesting, too, by the way. Listen,
Alyosha, you always speak the truth, though you're always between
two stools. Have you thought of it or not? Answer."

"I have," answered Alyosha in a low voice. Even Rakitin was
taken aback.

"What? Have you really?" he cried.

"Iâ€¦ I've not exactly thought it," muttered Alyosha, "but
directly you began speaking so strangely, I fancied I had thought
of it myself."
