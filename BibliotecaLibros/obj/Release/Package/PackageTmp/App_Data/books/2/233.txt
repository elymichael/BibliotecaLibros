"You here, Alexey? Can you have- " he began wondering but broke
off. He had meant to say, "Can you have come to this?"

Alyosha did not look at him, but from a slight movement Rakitin
at once saw that he heard and understood him.

"What's the matter?" he went on; but the surprise in his face
gradually passed into a smile that became more and more
ironical.

"I say, I've been looking for you for the last two hours. You
suddenly disappeared. What are you about? What foolery is this? You
might just look at meâ€¦ "

Alyosha raised his head, sat up and leaned his back against the
tree. He was not crying, but there was a look of suffering and
irritability in his face. He did not look at Rakitin, however, but
looked away to one side of him.

"Do you know your face is quite changed? There's none of your
famous mildness to be seen in it. Are you angry with someone? Have
they been ill-treating you?"

"Let me alone," said Alyosha suddenly, with a weary gesture of
his hand, still looking away from him.

"Oho! So that's how we are feeling! So you can shout at people
like other mortals. That is a come-down from the angels. I say,
Alyosha, you have surprised me, do you hear? I mean it. It's long
since I've been surprised at anything here. I always took you for
an educated man.

Alyosha at last looked at him, but vaguely, as though scarcely
understanding what he said.

"Can you really be so upset simply because your old man has
begun to stink? You don't mean to say you seriously believed that
he was going to work miracles?" exclaimed Rakitin, genuinely
surprised again.
