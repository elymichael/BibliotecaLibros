that was made wine, and knew not whence it was<br/><br/>(but the servants which drew the water knew);<br/><br/>the governor of the feast called the bridegroom,<br/><br/>"And saith unto him, Every man at the beginning doth<br/><br/>set forth good wine; and when men have well drunk,<br/><br/>that which is worse; but thou hast kept the good wine until<br/>now."<br/><br/>"But what's this, what's this? Why is the room growing wider?…<br/>Ah, yes… It's the marriage, the wedding… yes, of course. Here are<br/>the guests, here are the young couple sitting, and the merry crowd<br/>and… Where is the wise governor of the feast? But who is this? Who?<br/>Again the walls are receding… . Who is getting up there from the<br/>great table? What!… He here, too? But he's in the coffin… but he's<br/>here, too. He has stood up, he sees me, he is coming here… .<br/>God!"…<br/><br/>Yes, he came up to him, to him, he, the little, thin old man,<br/>with tiny wrinkles on his face, joyful and laughing softly. There<br/>was no coffin now, and he was in the same dress as he had worn<br/>yesterday sitting with them, when the visitors had gathered about<br/>him. His face was uncovered, his eyes were shining. How was this,<br/>then? He, too, had been called to the feast. He, too, at the<br/>marriage of Cana in Galilee… .<br/><br/>"Yes, my dear, I am called, too, called and bidden," he heard a<br/>soft voice saying over him. "Why have you hidden yourself here, out<br/>of sight? You come and join us too."<br/><br/>It was his voice, the voice of Father Zossima. And it must be<br/>he, since he called him!<br/><br/>The elder raised Alyosha by the hand and he rose from his<br/>knees.<br/>
