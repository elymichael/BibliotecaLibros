"Lord, receive me, with all my lawlessness, and do not condemn<br/>me. Let me pass by Thy judgment… do not condemn me, for I have<br/>condemned myself, do not condemn me, for I love Thee, O Lord. I am<br/>a wretch, but I love Thee. If Thou sendest me to hell, I shall love<br/>Thee there, and from there I shall cry out that I love Thee for<br/>ever and ever… . But let me love to the end… . Here and now for<br/>just five hours… till the first light of Thy day… for I love the<br/>queen of my soul… I love her and I cannot help loving her. Thou<br/>seest my whole heart… I shall gallop up, I shall fall before her<br/>and say, 'You are right to pass on and leave me. Farewell and<br/>forget your victim… never fret yourself about me!'"<br/><br/>"Mokroe!" cried Andrey, pointing ahead with his whip.<br/><br/>Through the pale darkness of the night loomed a solid black mass<br/>of buildings, flung down, as it were, in the vast plain. The<br/>village of Mokroe numbered two thousand inhabitants, but at that<br/>hour all were asleep, and only here and there a few lights still<br/>twinkled.<br/><br/>"Drive on, Andrey, I come!" Mitya exclaimed, feverishly.<br/><br/>"They're not asleep," said Andrey again, pointing with his whip<br/>to the Plastunovs' inn, which was at the entrance to the village.<br/>The six windows, looking on the street, were all brightly lighted<br/>up.<br/><br/>"They're not asleep," Mitya repeated joyously. "Quicker, Andrey!<br/>Gallop! Drive up with a dash! Set the bells ringing! Let all know<br/>that I have come. I'm coming! I'm coming, too!"<br/><br/>Andrey lashed his exhausted team into a gallop, drove with a<br/>dash and pulled up his steaming, panting horses at the high flight<br/>of steps.<br/><br/>Mitya jumped out of the cart just as the innkeeper, on his way<br/>to bed, peeped out from the steps curious to see who had<br/>arrived.<br/><br/>"Trifon Borissovitch, is that you?"<br/><br/>The innkeeper bent down, looked intently, ran down the steps,<br/>and rushed up to the guest with obsequious delight.<br/><br/>"Dmitri Fyodorovitch, your honour! Do I see you again?"<br/>
