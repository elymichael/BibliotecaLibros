<br/>"Stay. Look at the night. You see what a dark night, what<br/>clouds, what a wind has risen. I hid here under the willow waiting<br/>for you. And as God's above, I suddenly thought, why go on in<br/>misery any longer, what is there to wait for? Here I have a willow,<br/>a handkerchief, a shirt, I can twist them into a rope in a minute,<br/>and braces besides, and why go on burdening the earth, dishonouring<br/>it with my vile presence? And then I heard you coming- Heavens, it<br/>was as though something flew down to me suddenly. So there is a<br/>man, then, whom I love. Here he is, that man, my dear little<br/>brother, whom I love more than anyone in the world, the only one I<br/>love in the world. And I loved you so much, so much at that moment<br/>that I thought, 'I'll fall on his neck at once.' Then a stupid idea<br/>struck me, to have a joke with you and scare you. I shouted, like a<br/>fool, 'Your money!' Forgive my foolery- it was only nonsense, and<br/>there's nothing unseemly in my soul… . Damn it all, tell me what's<br/>happened. What did she say? Strike me, crush me, don't spare me!<br/>Was she furious?"<br/><br/>"No, not that… . There was nothing like that, Mitya. There- I<br/>found them both there."<br/><br/>"Both? Whom?"<br/><br/>"Grushenka at Katerina Ivanovna's."<br/><br/>Dmitri was struck dumb.<br/><br/>"Impossible!" he cried. "You're raving! Grushenka with her?"<br/><br/>Alyosha described all that had happened from the moment he went<br/>in to Katerina Ivanovna's. He was ten minutes telling his story.<br/>can't be said to have told it fluently and consecutively, but he<br/>seemed to make it clear, not omitting any word or action of<br/>significance, and vividly describing, often in one word, his own<br/>sensations. Dmitri listened in silence, gazing at him with a<br/>terrible fixed stare, but it was clear to Alyosha that he<br/>understood it all, and had grasped every point. But as the story<br/>went on, his face became not merely gloomy, but menacing. He<br/>scowled, he clenched his teeth, and his fixed stare became still<br/>more rigid, more concentrated, more terrible, when suddenly, with<br/>incredible rapidity, his wrathful, savage face changed, his tightly<br/>compressed lips parted, and Dmitri Fyodorovitch broke into<br/>uncontrolled, spontaneous laughter. He literally shook with<br/>laughter. For a long time he could not speak.<br/><br/>"So she wouldn't kiss her hand! So she didn't kiss it; so she<br/>ran away!" he kept exclaiming with hysterical delight; insolent<br/>delight it might had been called, if it had not been so<br/>spontaneous. "So the other one called her tigress! And a tigress<br/>she is! So she ought to be flogged on a scaffold? Yes, yes, so she<br/>ought. That's just what I think; she ought to have been long ago.<br/>It's like this, brother, let her be punished, but I must get better<br/>first. I understand the queen of impudence. That's her all over!<br/>You saw her all over in that hand-kissing, the she-devil! She's<br/>magnificent in her own line! So she ran home? I'll go- ah- I'll run<br/>to her! Alyosha, don't blame me, I agree that hanging is too good<br/>for her."<br/><br/>"But Katerina Ivanovna!" exclaimed Alyosha sorrowfully.<br/><br/>"I see her, too! I see right through her, as I've never done<br/>before! It's a regular discovery of the four continents of the<br/>world, that is, of the five! What a thing to do! That's just like<br/>Katya, who was not afraid to face a coarse, unmannerly officer and<br/>risk a deadly insult on a generous impulse to save her father! But<br/>the pride, the recklessness, the defiance of fate, the unbounded<br/>defiance! You say that aunt tried to stop her? That aunt, you know,<br/>is overbearing, herself. She's the sister of the general's widow in<br/>Moscow, and even more stuck-up than she. But her husband was caught<br/>stealing government money. He lost everything, his estate and all,<br/>and the proud wife had to lower her colours, and hasn't raised them<br/>since. So she tried to prevent Katya, but she wouldn't listen to<br/>her! She thinks she can overcome everything, that everything will<br/>give way to her. She thought she could bewitch Grushenka if she<br/>liked, and she believed it herself: she plays a part to herself,<br/>and whose fault is it? Do you think she kissed Grushenka's hand<br/>first, on purpose, with a motive? No, she really was fascinated by<br/>Grushenka, that's to say, not by Grushenka, but by her own dream,<br/>her own delusion- because it was her dream, her delusion! Alyosha,<br/>darling, how did you escape from them, those women? Did you pick up<br/>your cassock and run? Ha ha ha!"<br/><br/>
