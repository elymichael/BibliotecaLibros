"No, not at all. Next day, in the morning, before they took me<br/>to the hospital, I had a real attack and a more violent one than<br/>I've had for years. For two days I was quite unconscious."<br/><br/>"All right, all right. Go on."<br/><br/>"They laid me on the bed. I knew I'd be the other side of the<br/>partition, for whenever I was ill, Marfa Ignatyevna used to put me<br/>there, near them. She's always been very kind to me, from my birth<br/>up. At night I moaned, but quietly. I kept expecting Dmitri<br/>Fyodorovitch to come."<br/><br/>"Expecting him? To come to you?"<br/><br/>"Not to me. I expected him to come into the house, for I'd no<br/>doubt that he'd come that night, for being without me and getting<br/>no news, he'd be sure to come and climb over the fence, as he used<br/>to, and do something."<br/><br/>"And if he hadn't come?"<br/><br/>"Then nothing would have happened. I should never have brought<br/>myself to it without him."<br/><br/>"All right, all right. speak more intelligibly, don't hurry;<br/>above all, don't leave anything out!"<br/><br/>"I expected him to kill Fyodor Pavlovitch. I thought that was<br/>certain, for I had prepared him for it… during the last few days… .<br/>He knew about the knocks, that was the chief thing. With his<br/>suspiciousness and the fury which had been growing in him all those<br/>days, he was bound to get into the house by means of those taps.<br/>That was inevitable, so I was expecting him."<br/><br/>"Stay," Ivan interrupted; "if he had killed him, he would have<br/>taken the money and carried it away; you must have considered that.<br/>What would you have got by it afterwards? I don't see." 0 "But he<br/>would never have found the money. That was only what I told him,<br/>that the money was under the mattress. But that wasn't true. It had<br/>been lying in a box. And afterwards I suggested to Fyodor<br/>Pavlovitch, as I was the only person he trusted, to hide the<br/>envelope with the notes in the corner behind the ikons, for no one<br/>would have guessed that place, especially if they came in a hurry.<br/>So that's where the envelope lay, in the corner behind the ikons.<br/>It would have been absurd to keep it under the mattress; the box,<br/>anyway, could be locked. But all believe it was under the mattress.<br/>A stupid thing to believe. So if Dmitri Fyodorovitch had committed<br/>the murder, finding nothing, he would either have run away in a<br/>hurry, afraid of every sound, as always happens with murderers, or<br/>he would have been arrested. So I could always have clambered up to<br/>the ikons and have taken away the money next moming or even that<br/>night, and it would have all been put down to Dmitri Fyodorovitch.<br/>I could reckon upon that."<br/><br/>"But what if he did not kill him, but only knocked him<br/>down?"<br/>
