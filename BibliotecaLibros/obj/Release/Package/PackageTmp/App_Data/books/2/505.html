"Very good," he commented at last. "You see, I haven't jumped<br/>up, I haven't knocked you down, I haven't killed you. Speak on. So,<br/>according to you, I had fixed on Dmitri to do it; I was reckoning<br/>on him?"<br/><br/>"How could you help reckoning on him? If he killed him, then he<br/>would lose all the rights of a nobleman, his rank and property, and<br/>would go off to exile; so his share of the inheritance would come<br/>to you and your brother Alexey Fyodorovitch in equal parts; so<br/>you'd each have not forty, but sixty thousand each. There's not a<br/>doubt you did reckon on Dmitri Fyodorovitch."<br/><br/>"What I put up with from you! Listen, scoundrel, if I had<br/>reckoned on anyone then, it would have been on you, not on Dmitri,<br/>and I swear I did expect some wickedness from you… at the time… . I<br/>remember my impression!<br/><br/>"I thought, too, for a minute, at the time, that you were<br/>reckoning on me as well," said Smerdyakov, with a sarcastic grin.<br/>"So that it was just by that more than anything you showed me what<br/>was in your mind. For if you had a foreboding about me and yet went<br/>away, you as good as said to me, 'You can murder my parent, I won't<br/>hinder you!"'<br/><br/>"You scoundrel! So that's how you understood it!"<br/><br/>"It was all that going to Tchermashnya. Why! You were meaning to<br/>go to Moscow and refused all your father's entreaties to go to<br/>Tchermashnya- and simply at a foolish word from me you consented at<br/>once! What reason had you to consent to Tchermashnya? Since you<br/>went to Tchermashnya with no reason, simply at my word, it shows<br/>that you must have expected something from me."<br/><br/>No, I swear I didn't!" shouted Ivan, grinding his teeth.<br/><br/>"You didn't? Then you ought, as your father's son, to have had<br/>me taken to the lock-up and thrashed at once for my words then… or<br/>at least, to have given me a punch in the face on the spot, but you<br/>were not a bit angry, if you please, and at once in a friendly way<br/>acted on my foolish word and went away, which was utterly absurd,<br/>for you ought to have stayed to save your parent's life. How could<br/>I help drawing my conclusions?"<br/><br/>Ivan sat scowling, both his fists convulsively pressed on his<br/>knees.<br/><br/>"Yes, I am sorry I didn't punch you in the face," he said with a<br/>bitter smile. "I couldn't have taken you to the lock-up just then.<br/>Who would have believed me and what charge could I bring against<br/>you? But the punch in the face… oh, I'm sorry I didn't think of it.<br/>Though blows are forbidden, I should have pounded your ugly face to<br/>a jelly."<br/><br/>Smerdyakov looked at him almost with relish.<br/>
