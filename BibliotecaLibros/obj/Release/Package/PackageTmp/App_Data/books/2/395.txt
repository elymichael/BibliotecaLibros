"You see, I remember once taking a cap for a rag, perhaps to
wipe my pen on. I took it without asking, because it was a
worthless rag. I tore it up, and I took the notes and sewed them up
in it. I believe it was in that very rag I sewed them. An old piece
of calico, washed a thousand times."

"And you remember that for certain now?"

"I don't know whether for certain. I think it was in the cap.
But, hang it, what does it matter?"

"In that case your landlady will remember that the thing was
lost?"

"No, she won't, she didn't miss it. It was an old rag, I tell
you, an old rag not worth a farthing."

"And where did you get the needle and thread?"

"I'll stop now. I won't say any more. Enough of it!" said Mitya,
losing his temper at last.

"It's strange that you should have so completely forgotten where
you threw the pieces in the market-place."

"Give orders for the market-place to be swept to-morrow, and
perhaps you'll find it," said Mitya sneering. "Enough, gentlemen,
enough!" he decided, in an exhausted voice. "I see you don't
believe me! Not for a moment! It's my fault, not yours. I ought not
to have been so ready. Why, why did I degrade myself by confessing
my secret to you? it's a joke to you. I see that from your eyes.
You led me on to it, prosecutor! Sing a hymn of triumph if you canâ€¦
. Damn you, you torturers!"

He bent his head, and hid his face in his hands. The lawyers
were silent. A minute later he raised his head and looked at them
almost vacantly. His face now expressed complete, hopeless despair,
and he sat mute and passive as though hardly conscious of what was
happening. In the meantime they had to finish what they were about.
They had immediately to begin examining the witnesses. It was by
now eight o'clock in the morning. The lights had been extinguished
long ago. Mihail Makarovitch and Kalganov, who had been continually
in and out of the room all the while the interrogation had been
going on, had now both gone out again. The lawyers, too, looked
very tired. It was a wretched morning, the whole sky was overcast,
and the rain streamed down in bucketfuls. Mitya gazed blankly out
of window.
