"Yes, it's all bloody," observed Mitya, looking at the cuff of
his shirt.

"Then change your shirt."

"I haven't time. You see I'll… " Mitya went on with the same
confiding ingenuousness, drying his face and hands on the towel,
and putting on his coat. "I'll turn it up at the wrist. It won't be
seen under the coat… . You see!"

"Tell me now, what game have you been up to? Have you been
fighting with someone? In the tavern again, as before? Have you
been beating that captain again?" Pyotr Ilyitch asked him
reproachfully. "Whom have you been beating now… or killing,
perhaps?"

"Nonsense!" said Mitya.

"Don't worry," said Mitya, and he suddenly laughed. "I smashed
an old woman in the market-place just now."

"Smashed? An old woman?"

"An old man!" cried Mitya, looking Pyotr Ilyitch straight in the
face, laughing, and shouting at him as though he were deaf.

"Confound it! An old woman, an old man… . Have you killed
someone?"

"We made it up. We had a row- and made it up. In a place I know
of. We parted friends. A fool… . He's forgiven me… . He's sure to
have forgiven me by now… if he had got up, he wouldn't have
forgiven me"- Mitya suddenly winked- "only damn him, you know, I
say, Pyotr Ilyitch, damn him! Don't worry about him! I don't want
to just now!" Mitya snapped out, resolutely.
