<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>8<br/>A<br/>Treatise on Smerdyakov<br/><br/><br/>"TO begin with, what was the source of this suspicion?" (Ippolit<br/>Kirillovitch began). "The first person who cried out that<br/>Smerdyakov had committed the murder was the prisoner himself at the<br/>moment of his arrest, yet from that time to this he had not brought<br/>forward a single fact to confirm the charge, nor the faintest<br/>suggestion of a fact. The charge is confirmed by three persons<br/>only- the two brothers of the prisoner and Madame Svyetlov. The<br/>elder of these brothers expressed his suspicions only to-day, when<br/>he was undoubtedly suffering from brain fever. But we know that for<br/>the last two months he has completely shared our conviction of his<br/>brother's guilt and did not attempt to combat that idea. But of<br/>that later. The younger brother has admitted that he has not the<br/>slightest fact to support his notion of Smerdyakov's guilt, and has<br/>only been led to that conclusion from the prisoner's own words and<br/>the expression of his face. Yes, that astounding piece of evidence<br/>has been brought forward twice to-day by him. Madame Svyetslov was<br/>even more astounding. 'What the prisoner tells you, you must<br/>believe; he is not a man to tell a lie.' That is all the evidence<br/>against Smerdyakov produced by these three persons. who are all<br/>deeply concerned in the prisoner's fate. And yet the theory of<br/>Smerdyakov's guilt has been noised about, has been and is still<br/>maintained. Is it credible? Is it conceivable?"<br/><br/>Here Ippolit Kirillovitch thought it necessary to describe the<br/>personality of Smerdyakov, "who had cut short his life in a fit of<br/>insanity." He depicted him as a man of weak intellect, with a<br/>smattering of education, who had been thrown off his balance by<br/>philosophical ideas above his level and certain modern theories of<br/>duty, which he learnt in practice from the reckless life of his<br/>master, who was also perhaps his father- Fyodor Pavlovitch; and,<br/>theoretically, from various strange philosophical conversations<br/>with his master's elder son, Ivan Fyodorovitch, who readily<br/>indulged in this diversion, probably feeling dull or wishing to<br/>amuse himself at the valet's expense. "He spoke to me himself of<br/>his spiritual condition during the last few days at his father's<br/>house," Ippolit Kirillovitch explained; "but others too have borne<br/>witness to it- the prisoner himself, his brother, and the servant<br/>Grigory- that is, all who knew him well.<br/><br/>"Moreover, Smerdyakov, whose health was shaken by his attacks of<br/>epilepsy, had not the courage of a chicken. 'He fell at my feet and<br/>kissed them,' the prisoner himself has told us, before he realised<br/>how damaging such a statement was to himself. 'He is an epileptic<br/>chicken,' he declared about him in his characteristic language. And<br/>the prisoner chose him for his confidant (we have his own word for<br/>it) and he frightened him into consenting at last to act as a spy<br/>for him. In that capacity he deceived his master, revealing to the<br/>prisoner the existence of the envelope with the notes in it and the<br/>signals by means of which he could get into the house. How could he<br/>help telling him, indeed? 'He would have killed me, I could see<br/>that he would have killed me,' he said at the inquiry, trembling<br/>and shaking even before us, though his tormentor was by that time<br/>arrested and could do him no harm. 'He suspected me at every<br/>instant. In fear and trembling I hastened to tell him every secret<br/>to pacify him, that he might see that I had not deceived him and<br/>let me off alive.' Those are his own words. I wrote them down and I<br/>remember them. 'When he began shouting at me, I would fall on my<br/>knees.'<br/><br/>"He was naturally very honest and enjoyed the complete<br/>confidence of his master, ever since he had restored him some money<br/>he had lost. So it may be supposed that the poor fellow suffered<br/>pangs of remorse at having deceived his master, whom he loved as<br/>his benefactor. Persons severely afflicted with epilepsy are, so<br/>the most skilful doctors tell us, always prone to continual and<br/>morbid self-reproach. They worry over their 'wickedness,' they are<br/>tormented by pangs of conscience, often entirely without cause;<br/>they exaggerate and often invent all sorts of faults and crimes.<br/>And here we have a man of that type who had really been driven to<br/>wrongdoing by terror and intimidation.<br/><br/>"He had, besides, a strong presentiment that something terrible<br/>would be the outcome of the situation that was developing before<br/>his eyes. When Ivan Fyodorovitch was leaving for Moscow, just<br/>before the catastrophe, Smerdyakov besought him to remain, though<br/>he was too timid to tell him plainly what he feared. He confined<br/>himself to hints, but his hints were not understood.<br/><br/>"It must be observed that he looked on Ivan Fyodorovitch as a<br/>protector, whose presence in the house was a guarantee that no harm<br/>would come to pass. Remember the phrase in Dmitri Karamazov's<br/>drunken letter, 'I shall kill the old man, if only Ivan goes away.'<br/>So Ivan Fyodorovitch's presence seemed to everyone a guarantee of<br/>peace and order in the house.<br/><br/>"But he went away, and within an hour of his young master's<br/>departure Smerdyakov was taken with an epileptic fit. But that's<br/>perfectly intelligible. Here I must mention that Smerdyakov,<br/>oppressed by terror and despair of a sort, had felt during those<br/>last few days that one of the fits from which he had suffered<br/>before at moments of strain, might be coming upon him again. The<br/>day and hour of such an attack cannot, of course, be foreseen, but<br/>every epileptic can feel beforehand that he is likely to have one.<br/>So the doctors tell us. And so, as soon as Ivan Fyodorovitch had<br/>driven out of the yard, Smerdyakov, depressed by his lonely and<br/>unprotected position, went to the cellar. He went down the stairs<br/>wondering if he would have a fit or not, and what if it were to<br/>come upon him at once. And that very apprehension, that very<br/>wonder, brought on the spasm in his throat that always precedes<br/>such attacks, and he fell unconscious into the cellar. And in this<br/>perfectly natural occurrence people try to detect a suspicion, a<br/>hint that he was shamming an attack on purpose. But, if it were on<br/>purpose, the question arises at once, what was his motive? What was<br/>he reckoning on? What was he aiming at? I say nothing about<br/>medicine: science, I am told, may go astray: the doctors were not<br/>able to discriminate between the counterfeit and the real. That may<br/>be so, but answer me one question: what motive had he for such a<br/>counterfeit? Could he, had he been plotting the murder, have<br/>desired to attract the attention of the household by having a fit<br/>just before?<br/>
