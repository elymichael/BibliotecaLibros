<br/>"I sufferâ€¦ from lack of faith."<br/><br/>"Lack of faith in God?"<br/><br/>"Oh, no, no! I dare not even think of that. But the future life-<br/>it is such an enigma And no one, no one can solve it. Listen! You<br/>are a healer, you are deeply versed in the human soul, and of<br/>course I dare not expect you to believe me entirely, but I assure<br/>you on my word of honour that I am not speaking lightly now. The<br/>thought of the life beyond the grave distracts me to anguish, to<br/>terror. And I don't know to whom to appeal, and have not dared to<br/>all my life. And now I am so bold as to ask you. Oh, God! What will<br/>you think of me now?"<br/><br/>She clasped her hands.<br/><br/>"Don't distress yourself about my opinion of you," said the<br/>elder. "I quite believe in the sincerity of your suffering."<br/><br/>"Oh, how thankful I am to you! You see, I shut my eyes and ask<br/>myself if everyone has faith, where did it come from? And then they<br/>do say that it all comes from terror at the menacing phenomena of<br/>nature, and that none of it's real. And I say to myself, 'What if<br/>I've been believing all my life, and when I come to die there's<br/>nothing but the burdocks growing on my grave?' as I read in some<br/>author. It's awful! How- how can I get back my faith? But I only<br/>believed when I was a little child, mechanically, without thinking<br/>of anything. How, how is one to prove it? have come now to lay my<br/>soul before you and to ask you about it. If I let this chance slip,<br/>no one all my life will answer me. How can I prove it? How can I<br/>convince myself? Oh, how unhappy I am! I stand and look about me<br/>and see that scarcely anyone else cares; no one troubles his head<br/>about it, and I'm the only one who can't stand it. It's deadly-<br/>deadly!"<br/><br/>"No doubt. But there's no proving it, though you can be<br/>convinced of it."<br/><br/>"By the experience of active love. Strive to love your neighbour<br/>actively and indefatigably. In as far as you advance in love you<br/>will grow surer of the reality of God and of the immortality of<br/>your soul. If you attain to perfect self-forgetfulness in the love<br/>of your neighbour, then you will believe without doubt, and no<br/>doubt can possibly enter your soul. This has been tried. This is<br/>certain."<br/><br/>"In active love? There's another question and such a question!<br/>You see, I so love humanity that- would you believe it?- I often<br/>dream of forsaking all that I have, leaving Lise, and becoming a<br/>sister of mercy. I close my eyes and think and dream, and at that<br/>moment I feel full of strength to overcome all obstacles. No<br/>wounds, no festering sores could at that moment frighten me. I<br/>would bind them up and wash them with my own hands. I would nurse<br/>the afflicted. I would be ready to kiss such wounds."<br/><br/>"It is much, and well that your mind is full of such dreams and<br/>not others. Some time, unawares, you may do a good deed in<br/>reality."<br/><br/>
