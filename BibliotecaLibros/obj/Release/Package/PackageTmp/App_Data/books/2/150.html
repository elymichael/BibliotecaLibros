<br/>"And do you suppose I'd thrash him? That I'd take my Ilusha and<br/>thrash him before you for your satisfaction? Would you like it done<br/>at once, sir?" said the captain, suddenly turning to Alyosha, as<br/>though he were going to attack him. "I am sorry about your finger,<br/>sir; but instead of thrashing Ilusha, would you like me to chop off<br/>my four fingers with this knife here before your eyes to satisfy<br/>your just wrath? I should think four fingers would be enough to<br/>satisfy your thirst for vengeance. You won't ask for the fifth one<br/>too?" He stopped short with a catch in his throat. Every feature in<br/>his face was twitching and working; he looked extremely defiant. He<br/>was in a sort of frenzy.<br/><br/>"I think I understand it all now," said Alyosha gently and<br/>sorrowfully, still keeping his seat. "So your boy is a good boy, he<br/>loves his father, and he attacked me as the brother of your<br/>assailantâ€¦ . Now I understand it," he repeated thoughtfully. "But<br/>my brother Dmitri Fyodorovitch regrets his action, I know that, and<br/>if only it is possible for him to come to you, or better still, to<br/>meet you in that same place, he will ask your forgiveness before<br/>everyone- if you wish it."<br/><br/>"After pulling out my beard, you mean, he will ask my<br/>forgiveness? And he thinks that will be a satisfactory finish,<br/>doesn't he?"<br/><br/>"Oh, no! On the contrary, he will do anything you like and in<br/>any way you like."<br/><br/>"So if I were to ask his highness to go down on his knees before<br/>me in that very tavern- 'The Metropolis' it's called- or in the<br/>marketplace, he would do it?"<br/><br/>"Yes, he would even go down on his knees."<br/><br/>"You've pierced me to the heart, sir. Touched me to tears and<br/>pierced me to the heart! I am only too sensible of your brother's<br/>generosity. Allow me to introduce my family, my two daughters and<br/>my son- my litter. If I die, who will care for them, and while I<br/>live who but they will care for a wretch like me? That's a great<br/>thing the Lord has ordained for every man of my sort, sir. For<br/>there must be someone able to love even a man like me."<br/><br/>"Ah, that's perfectly true!" exclaimed Alyosha.<br/><br/>"Oh, do leave off playing the fool! Some idiot comes in, and you<br/>put us to shame!" cried the girl by the window, suddenly turning to<br/>her father with a disdainful and contemptuous air.<br/><br/>"Wait a little, Varvara!" cried her father, speaking<br/>peremptorily but looking at them quite approvingly. "That's her<br/>character," he said, addressing Alyosha again.<br/><br/>
