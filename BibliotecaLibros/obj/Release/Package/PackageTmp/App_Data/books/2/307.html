"They're two gentlemen from the town… . They've come back from<br/>Tcherny, and are putting up here. One's quite a young gentleman, a<br/>relative of Mr. Miusov he must be, but I've forgotten his name… and<br/>I expect you know the other, too, a gentleman called Maximov. He's<br/>been on a pilgrimage, so he says, to the monastery in the town.<br/>He's travelling with this young relation of Mr. Miusov."<br/><br/>"Is that all?"<br/><br/>"Stay, listen, Trifon Borissovitch. Tell me the chief thing:<br/>What of her? How is she?"<br/><br/>"Oh, she's only just come. She's sitting with them."<br/><br/>"Is she cheerful? Is she laughing?"<br/><br/>"No, I think she's not laughing much. She's sitting quite dull.<br/>She's combing the young gentleman's hair."<br/><br/>"The Pole- the officer?"<br/><br/>"He's not young, and he's not an officer, either. Not him, sir.<br/>It's the young gentleman that's Mr. Miusov's relation. I've<br/>forgotten his name."<br/><br/>"Kalganov?"<br/><br/>"That's it, Kalganov!"<br/><br/>"All right. I'll see for myself. Are they playing cards?"<br/>
