<br/>"That's just a song of yesterday," he said aloud. "Who writes<br/>such things for them? They might just as well have had a railwayman<br/>or a Jew come to try his luck with the girls; they'd have carried<br/>all before them."<br/><br/>And, almost as though it were a personal affront, he declared,<br/>on the spot, that he was bored, sat down on the sofa and<br/>immediately fell asleep. His pretty little face looked rather pale,<br/>as it fell back on the sofa cushion.<br/><br/>"Look how pretty he is," said Grushenka, taking Mitya up to him.<br/>"I was combing his hair just now; his hair's like flax, and so<br/>thick… "<br/><br/>And, bending over him tenderly, she kissed his forehead.<br/>Kalgonov instantly opened his eyes, looked at her, stood up, and<br/>with the most anxious air inquired where was Maximov?<br/><br/>"So that's who it is you want." Grushenka laughed. "Stay with me<br/>a minute. Mitya, run and find his Maximov."<br/><br/>Maximov, it appeared, could not tear himself away from the<br/>girls, only running away from time to time to pour himself out a<br/>glass of liqueur. He had drunk two cups of chocolate. His face was<br/>red, and his nose was crimson; his eyes were moist, and mawkishly<br/>sweet.He ran up and announced that he was going to dance the<br/>"sabotiere."<br/><br/>"They taught me all those well-bred, aristocratic dances when I<br/>was little… "<br/><br/>"Go, go with him, Mitya, and I'll watch from here how he<br/>dances," said Grushenka.<br/><br/>"No, no, I'm coming to look on, too," exclaimed Kalganov,<br/>brushing aside in the most naive way Grushenka's offer to sit with<br/>him. They all went to look on. Maximov danced his dance. But it<br/>roused no great admiration in anyone but Mitya. It consisted of<br/>nothing but skipping and hopping, kicking the feet, and at every<br/>skip Maximov slapped the upturned sole of his foot. Kalgonov did<br/>not like it at all, but Mitya kissed the dancer.<br/><br/>"Thanks. You're tired perhaps? What are you looking for here?<br/>Would you like some sweets? A cigar, perhaps?"<br/><br/>
