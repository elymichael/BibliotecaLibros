"He's no money; not a farthing. I'll settle down for the night,
and think things over, and you can go. Perhaps you'll meet herâ€¦ .
Only be sure to come to me to-morrow in the morning. Be sure to. I
have a word to say to you to-morrow. Will you come?"

"When you come, pretend you've come of your own accord to ask
after me. Don't tell anyone I told you to. Don't say a word to
Ivan."

"Very well."

"Good-bye, my angel. You stood up for me, just now. I shall
never forget it. I've a word to say to you to-morrow- but I must
think about it."

"And how do you feel now?"

"I shall get up to-morrow and go out, perfectly well, perfectly
well!"

Crossing the yard Alyosha found Ivan sitting on the bench at the
gateway. He was sitting writing something in pencil in his
notebook. Alyosha told Ivan that their father had waked up, was
conscious, and had let him go back to sleep at the monastery.

"Alyosha, I should be very glad to meet you to-morrow morning,"
said Ivan cordially, standing up. His cordiality was a complete
surprise to Alyosha.

"I shall be at the Hohlakovs' to-morrow," answered Alyosha, "I
may be at Katerina Ivanovna's, too, if I don't find her now."

"But you're going to her now, anyway? For that 'compliments and
farewell,'" said Ivan smiling. Alyosha was disconcerted.

"I think I quite understand his exclamations just now, and part
of what went before. Dmitri has asked you to go to her and say that
he- well, in fact- takes his leave of her?"
