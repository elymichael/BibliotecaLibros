"What Piron?" cried Mitya.

"The famous French writer, Piron. We were all drinking then, a
big party of us, in a tavern at that very fair. They'd invited me,
and first of all I began quoting epigrams. 'Is that you, Boileau?
What a funny get-up!' and Boileau answers that he's going to a
masquerade, that is to the baths, he he! And they took it to
themselves, so I made haste to repeat another, very sarcastic, well
known to all educated people:

Yes, Sappho and Phaon are we!

But one grief is weighing on me.

You don't know your way to the sea!

"They were still more offended and began abusing me in the most
unseemly way for it. And as ill-luck would have it, to set things
right, I began telling a very cultivated anecdote about Piron, how
he was not accepted into the French Academy, and to revenge himself
wrote his own epitaph:

Ci-git Piron qui ne fut rien,

Pas meme academicien,*

* Here lies Piron, who was nothing, not even an Academician.

They seized me and thrashed me."
