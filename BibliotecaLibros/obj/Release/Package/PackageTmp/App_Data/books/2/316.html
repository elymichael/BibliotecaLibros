It was diffcult to imagine what Kalgonov was excited about, but<br/>his excitement was genuine. Mitya followed his lead without<br/>protest.<br/><br/>"Well, but if they did thrash him!" he cried, laughing.<br/><br/>"It's not that they thrashed me exactly, but what I mean is- "<br/>put in Maximov.<br/><br/>"What do you mean? Either they thrashed you or they didn't."<br/><br/>"What o'clock is it, panie?" the Pole, with the pipe, asked his<br/>tall friend, with a bored expression. The other shrugged his<br/>shoulders in reply. Neither of them had a watch.<br/><br/>"Why not talk? Let other people talk. Mustn't other people talk<br/>because you're bored?" Grushenka flew at him with evident intention<br/>of finding fault. Something seemed for the first time to flash upon<br/>Mitya's mind. This time the Pole answered with unmistakable<br/>irritability.<br/><br/>"Pani, I didn't oppose it. I didn't say anything."<br/><br/>"All right then. Come, tell us your story," Grushenka cried to<br/>Maximov. "Why are you all silent?"<br/><br/>"There's nothing to tell, it's all so foolish," answered Maximov<br/>at once, with evident satisfaction, mincing a little. "Besides, all<br/>that's by way of allegory in Gogol, for he's made all the names<br/>have a meaning. Nozdryov was really called Nosov, and Kuvshinikov<br/>had quite a different name, he was called Shkvornev. Fenardi really<br/>was called Fenardi, only he wasn't an Italian but a Russian, and<br/>Mamsel Fenardi was a pretty girl with her pretty little legs in<br/>tights, and she had a little short skirt with spangles, and she<br/>kept turning round and round, only not for four hours but for four<br/>minutes only, and she bewitched everyoneâ€¦ "<br/><br/>"But what were you beaten for?" cried Kalganov.<br/><br/>"For Piron!" answered Maximov.<br/>
