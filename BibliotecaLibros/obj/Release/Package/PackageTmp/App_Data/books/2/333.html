"What's the matter with him?" Mitya wondered for an instant, and<br/>he ran back to the room where the girls were dancing. But she was<br/>not there. She was not in the blue room either; there was no one<br/>but Kalgonov asleep on the sofa. Mitya peeped behind the curtain-<br/>she was there. She was sitting in the corner, on a trunk. Bent<br/>forward, with her head and arms on the bed close by, she was crying<br/>bitterly, doing her utmost to stifle her sobs that she might not be<br/>heard. Seeing Mitya, she beckoned him to her, and when he ran to<br/>her, she grasped his hand tightly.<br/><br/>"Mitya, Mitya, I loved him, you know. How I have loved him these<br/>five years, all that time! Did I love him or only my own anger? No,<br/>him, him! It's a lie that it was my anger I loved and not him.<br/>Mitya, I was only seventeen then; he was so kind to me, so merry;<br/>he used to sing to me… . Or so it seemed to a silly girl like me… .<br/>And now, O Lord, it's not the same man. Even his face is not the<br/>same; he's different altogether. I shouldn't have known him. I<br/>drove here with Timofey, and all the way I was thinking how I<br/>should meet him, what I should say to him, how we should look at<br/>one another. My soul was faint, and all of a sudden it was just as<br/>though he had emptied a pail of dirty water over me. He talked to<br/>me like a schoolmaster, all so grave and learned; he met me so<br/>solemnly that I was struck dumb. I couldn't get a word in. At first<br/>I thought he was ashamed to talk before his great big Pole. I sat<br/>staring at him and wondering why I couldn't say a word to him now.<br/>It must have been his wife that ruined him; you know he threw me up<br/>to get married. She must have changed him like that. Mitya, how<br/>shameful it is! Oh, Mitya, I'm ashamed, I'm ashamed for all my<br/>life. Curse it, curse it, curse those five years!"<br/><br/>And again she burst into tears, but clung tight to Mitya's hand<br/>and did not let it go.<br/><br/>"Mitya, darling, stay, don't go away. I want to say one word to<br/>you," she whispered, and suddenly raised her face to him. "Listen,<br/>tell me who it is I love? I love one man here. Who is that man?<br/>That's what you must tell me."<br/><br/>A smile lighted up her face that was swollen with weeping, and<br/>her eyes shone in the half darkness.<br/><br/>"A falcon flew in, and my heart sank. "Fool! that's the man you<br/>love!' That was what my heart whispered to me at once. You came in<br/>and all grew bright. What's he afraid of? I wondered. For you were<br/>frightened; you couldn't speak. It's not them he's afraid of- could<br/>you be frightened of anyone? It's me he's afraid of, I thought,<br/>only me. So Fenya told you, you little stupid, how I called to<br/>Alyosha out of the window that I'd loved Mityenka for one hour, and<br/>that I was going now to love… another. Mitya, Mitya, how could I be<br/>such a fool as to think I could love anyone after you? Do you<br/>forgive me, Mitya? Do you forgive me or not? Do you love me? Do you<br/>love me?" She jumped up and held him with both hands on his<br/>shoulders. Mitya, dumb with rapture, gazed into her eyes, at her<br/>face, at her smile, and suddenly clasped her tightly his arms and<br/>kissed her passionately.<br/><br/>"You will forgive me for having tormented you? It was through<br/>spite I tormented you all. It was for spite I drove the old man out<br/>of his mind… . Do you remember how you drank at my house one day<br/>and broke the wine-glass? I remembered that and I broke a glass<br/>to-day and drank 'to my vile heart.' Mitya, my falcon, why don't<br/>you kiss me? He kissed me once, and now he draws back and looks and<br/>listens. Why listen to me? Kiss me, kiss me hard, that's right. if<br/>you love, well, then, love! I'll be your slave now, your slave for<br/>the rest of my life. It's sweet to be a slave. Kiss me! Beat me,<br/>ill-treat me, do what you will with me… . And I do deserve to<br/>suffer. Stay, wait, afterwards, I won't have that… " she suddenly<br/>thrust him away. "Go along, Mitya, I'll come and have some wine, I<br/>want to be drunk, I'm going to get drunk and dance; I must, I<br/>must!" She tore herself away from him and disappeared behind the<br/>curtain. Mitya followed like a drunken man.<br/><br/>"Yes, come what may- whatever may happen now, for one minute I'd<br/>give the whole world," he thought. Grushenka did, in fact, toss off<br/>a whole glass of champagne at one gulp, and became at once very<br/>tipsy. She sat down in the same chair as before, with a blissful<br/>smile on her face. Her cheeks were glowing, her lips were burning,<br/>her flashing eyes were moist; there was passionate appeal in her<br/>eyes. Even Kalgonov felt a stir at the heart and went up to<br/>her.<br/><br/>"Did you feel how I kissed you when you were asleep just now?"<br/>she said thickly. "I'm drunk now, that's what it is… . And aren't<br/>you drunk? And why isn't Mitya drinking? Why don't you drink,<br/>Mitya? I'm drunk, and you don't drink… "<br/><br/>"I am drunk! I'm drunk as it is… drunk with you… and now I'll be<br/>drunk with wine, too."<br/><br/>He drank off another glass, and- he thought it strange himself-<br/>that glass made him completely drunk. He was suddenly drunk,<br/>although till that moment he had been quite sober, he remembered<br/>that. From that moment everything whirled about him, as though he<br/>were delirious. He walked, laughed, talked to everybody, without<br/>knowing what he was doing. Only one persistent burning sensation<br/>made itself felt continually, "like a red-hot coal in his heart,"<br/>he said afterwards. He went up to her, sat beside her, gazed at<br/>her, listened to her… . She became very talkative, kept calling<br/>everyone to her, and beckoned to different girls out of the chorus.<br/>When the girl came up, she either kissed her, or made the sign of<br/>the cross over her. In another minute she might have cried. She was<br/>greatly amused by the "little old man," as she called Maximov. He<br/>ran up every minute to kiss her hands, each little finger," and<br/>finally he danced another dance to an old song, which he sang<br/>himself. He danced with special vigour to the refrain:<br/>
