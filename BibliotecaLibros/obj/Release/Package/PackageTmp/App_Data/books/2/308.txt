"They have been playing, but they've left off. They've been
drinking tea, the official gentleman asked for liqueurs."

"Stay, Trifon Borissovitch, stay, my good soul, I'll see for
myself. Now answer one more question: are the gypsies here?"

"You can't have the gypsies now, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. The
authorities have sent them away. But we've Jews that play the
cymbals and the fiddle in the village, so one might send for them.
They'd come."

"Send for them. Certainly send for them!" cried Mitya. "And you
can get the girls together as you did then, Marya especially,
Stepanida, too, and Arina. Two hundred roubles for a chorus!"

"Oh, for a sum like that I can get all the village together,
though by now they're asleep. Are the peasants here worth such
kindness, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, or the girls either? To spend a sum
like that on such coarseness and rudeness! What's the good of
giving a peasant a cigar to smoke, the stinking ruffian! And the
girls are all lousy. Besides, I'll get my daughters up for nothing,
let alone a sum like that. They've only just gone to bed, I'll give
them a kick and set them singing for you. You gave the peasants
champagne to drink the other day, e-ech!"

For all his pretended compassion for Mitya, Trifon Borissovitch
had hidden half a dozen bottles of champagne on that last occasion,
and had picked up a hundred-rouble note under the table, and it had
remained in his clutches.

"Trifon Borissovitch, I sent more than one thousand flying last
time I was here. Do you remember?"

"You did send it flying. I may well remember. You must have left
three thousand behind you."

"Well, I've come to do the same again, do you see?"

And he pulled out his roll of notes, and held them up before the
innkeeper's nose.
