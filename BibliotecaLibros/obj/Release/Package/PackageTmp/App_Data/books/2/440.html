<br/>"No… I came with Perezvon. I've got a dog now, called Perezvon.<br/>A Slavonic name. He's out there… if I whistle, he'll run in. I've<br/>brought a dog, too," he said, addressing Ilusha all at once. "Do<br/>you remember Zhutchka, old man?" he suddenly fired the question at<br/>him.<br/><br/>Ilusha's little face quivered. He looked with an agonised<br/>expression at Kolya. Alyosha, standing at the door, frowned and<br/>signed to Kolya not to speak of Zhutchka, but he did not or would<br/>not notice.<br/><br/>"Where… is Zhutchka?" Ilusha asked in a broken voice.<br/><br/>"Oh well, my boy, your Zhutchka's lost and done for!"<br/><br/>Ilusha did not speak, but he fixed an intent gaze once more on<br/>Kolya. Alyosha, catching Kolya's eye, signed to him vigourously<br/>again, but he turned away his eyes pretending not to have<br/>noticed.<br/><br/>"It must have run away and died somewhere. It must have died<br/>after a meal like that," Kolya pronounced pitilessly, though he<br/>seemed a little breathless. "But I've got a dog, Perezvon… A<br/>Slavonic name… I've brought him to show you."<br/><br/>"I don't want him!" said Ilusha suddenly.<br/><br/>"No, no, you really must see him… it will amuse you. I brought<br/>him on purpose… . He's the same sort of shaggy dog… . You allow me<br/>to call in my dog, madam?" He suddenly addressed Madame Snegiryov,<br/>with inexplicable excitement in his manner.<br/><br/>"I don't want him, I don't want him!" cried Ilusha, with a<br/>mournful break in his voice. There was a reproachful light in his<br/>eyes.<br/><br/>"You'd better," the captain started up from the chest by the<br/>wall on which he had just sat down, "you'd better… another time,"<br/>he muttered, but Kolya could not be restrained. He hurriedly<br/>shouted to Smurov, "Open the door," and as soon as it was open, he<br/>blew his whistle. Perezvon dashed headlong into the room.<br/><br/>
