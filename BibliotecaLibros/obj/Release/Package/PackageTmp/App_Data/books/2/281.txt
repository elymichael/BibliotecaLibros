"Good heavens! What am I doing it for?" thought Mitya, suddenly
pulling himself together. "If I have broken his skull, how can I
find out now? And what difference does it make now?" he added,
hopelessly. "If I've killed him, I've killed him… . You've come to
grief, old man, so there you must lie!" he said aloud. And suddenly
turning to the fence, he vaulted over it into the lane and fell to
running- the handkerchief soaked with blood he held, crushed up in
his right fist, and as he ran he thrust it into the back pocket of
his coat. He ran headlong, and the few passers-by who met him in
the dark, in the streets, remembered afterwards that they had met a
man running that night. He flew back again to the widow Morozov's
house.

Immediately after he had left it that evening, Fenya had rushed
to the chief porter, Nazar Ivanovitch, and besought him, for
Christ's sake, "not to let the captain in again to-day or
to-morrow." Nazar Ivanovitch promised, but went upstairs to his
mistress who had suddenly sent for him, and meeting his nephew, a
boy of twenty, who had recently come from the country, on the way
up told him to take his place, but forgot to mention "the captain."
Mitya, running up to the gate, knocked. The lad instantly
recognised him, for Mitya had more than once tipped him. Opening
the gate at once, he let him in, and hastened to inform him with a
good-humoured smile that "Agrafena Alexandrovna is not at home now,
you know."

"Where is she then, Prohor?" asked Mitya, stopping short.

"She set off this evening, some two hours ago, with Timofey, to
Mokroe."

"What for?" cried Mitya.

"That I can't say. To see some officer. Someone invited her and
horses were sent to fetch her."

Mitya left him, and ran like a madman to Fenya.
