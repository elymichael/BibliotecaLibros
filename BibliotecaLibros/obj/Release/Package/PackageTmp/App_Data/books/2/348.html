It was resolved to act with energy. The deputy police inspector<br/>of the town was commissioned to take four witnesses, to enter<br/>Fyodor Pavlovitch's house and there to open an inquiry on the spot,<br/>according to the regular forms, which I will not go into here. The<br/>district doctor, a zealous man, new to his work, almost insisted on<br/>accompanying the police captain, the prosecutor, and the<br/>investigating lawyer.<br/><br/>I will note briefly that Fyodor Pavlovitch was found to be quite<br/>dead, with his skull battered in. But with what? Most likely with<br/>the same weapon with which Grigory had been attacked. And<br/>immediately that weapon was found, Grigory, to whom all possible<br/>medical assistance was at once given, described in a weak and<br/>breaking voice how he had been knocked down. They began looking<br/>with a lantern by the fence and found the brass pestle dropped in a<br/>most conspicuous place on the garden path. There were no signs of<br/>disturbance in the room where Fyodor Pavlovitch was lying. But by<br/>the bed, behind the screen, they picked up from the floor a big and<br/>thick envelope with the inscription: "A present of three thousand<br/>roubles for my angel Grushenka, if she is willing to come." And<br/>below had been added by Fyodor Pavlovitch, "For my little chicken."<br/>There were three seals of red sealing-wax on the envelope, but it<br/>had been torn open and was empty: the money had been removed. They<br/>found also on the floor a piece of narrow pink ribbon, with which<br/>the envelope had been tied up.<br/><br/>One piece of Pyotr Ilyitch's evidence made a great impression on<br/>the prosecutor and the investigating magistrate, namely, his idea<br/>that Dmitri Fyodorovitch would shoot himself before daybreak, that<br/>he had resolved to do so, had spoken of it to Ilyitch, had taken<br/>the pistols, loaded them before him, written a letter, put it in<br/>his pocket, etc. When Pyotr Ilyitch, though still unwilling to<br/>believe in it, threatened to tell someone so as to prevent the<br/>suicide, Mitya had answered grinning: "You'll be too late." So they<br/>must make haste to Mokroe to find the criminal, before he really<br/>did shoot himself.<br/><br/>"That's clear, that's clear!" repeated the prosecutor in great<br/>excitement. "That's just the way with mad fellows like that: 'I<br/>shall kill myself to-morrow, so I'll make merry till I die!'"<br/><br/>The story of how he had bought the wine and provisions excited<br/>the prosecutor more than ever.<br/><br/>"Do you remember the fellow that murdered a merchant called<br/>Olsufyev, gentlemen? He stole fifteen hundred, went at once to have<br/>his hair curled, and then, without even hiding the money, carrying<br/>it almost in his hand in the same way, he went off to the<br/>girls."<br/><br/>All were delayed, however, by the inquiry, the search, and the<br/>formalities, etc., in the house of Fyodor Pavlovitch. It all took<br/>time and so, two hours before starting, they sent on ahead to<br/>Mokroe the officer of the rural police, Mavriky Mavrikyevitch<br/>Schmertsov, who had arrived in the town the morning before to get<br/>his pay. He was instructed to avoid raising the alarm when he<br/>reached Mokroe, but to keep constant watch over the "criminal" till<br/>the arrival of the proper authorities, to procure also witnesses<br/>for the arrest, police constables, and so on. Mavriky Mavrikyevitch<br/>did as he was told, preserving his incognito, and giving no one but<br/>his old acquaintance, Trifon Borissovitch, the slightest hint of<br/>his secret business. He had spoken to him just before Mitya met the<br/>landlord in the balcony, looking for him in the dark, and noticed<br/>at once a change in Trifon Borissovitch's face and voice. So<br/>neither Mitya nor anyone else knew that he was being watched. The<br/>box with the pistols had been carried off by Trifon Borissovitch<br/>and put in a suitable place. Only after four o'clock, almost at<br/>sunrise, all the officials, the police captain, the prosecutor, the<br/>investigating lawyer, drove up in two carriages, each drawn by<br/>three horses. The doctor remained at Fyodor Pavlovitch's to make a<br/>post-mortem next day on the body. But he was particularly<br/>interested in the condition of the servant, Smerdyakov.<br/><br/>"Such violent and protracted epileptic fits, recurring<br/>continually for twenty-four hours, are rarely to be met with, and<br/>are of interest to science," he declared enthusiastically to his<br/>companions, and as they left they laughingly congratulated him on<br/>his find. The prosecutor and the investigating lawyer distinctly<br/>remembered the doctor's saying that Smerdyakov could not outlive<br/>the night.<br/><br/>After these long, but I think necessary explanations, we will<br/>return to that moment of our tale at which we broke off.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
