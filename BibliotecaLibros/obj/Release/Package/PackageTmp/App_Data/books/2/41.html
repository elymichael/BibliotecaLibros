<br/>"So be it, so be it!" Father Paissy repeated austerely and<br/>reverently.<br/><br/>"Strange, extremely strange" Miusov pronounced, not so much with<br/>heat as with latent indignation.<br/><br/>"What strikes you as so strange?" Father Iosif inquired<br/>cautiously.<br/><br/>"Why, it's beyond anything!" cried Miusov, suddenly breaking<br/>out; "the State is eliminated and the Church is raised to the<br/>position of the State. It's not simply Ultramontanism, it's<br/>arch-Ultramontanism! It's beyond the dreams of Pope Gregory the<br/>Seventh!"<br/><br/>"You are completely misunderstanding it," said Father Paissy<br/>sternly. "Understand, the Church is not to be transformed into the<br/>State. That is Rome and its dream. That is the third temptation of<br/>the devil. On the contrary, the State is transformed into the<br/>Church, will ascend and become a Church over the whole world- which<br/>is the complete opposite of Ultramontanism and Rome, and your<br/>interpretation, and is only the glorious destiny ordained for the<br/>Orthodox Church. This star will arise in the east!"<br/><br/>Miusov was significantly silent. His whole figure expressed<br/>extraordinary personal dignity. A supercilious and condescending<br/>smile played on his lips. Alyosha watched it all with a throbbing<br/>heart. The whole conversation stirred him profoundly. He glanced<br/>casually at Rakitin, who was standing immovable in his place by the<br/>door listening and watching intently though with downcast eyes. But<br/>from the colour in his cheeks Alyosha guessed that Rakitin was<br/>probably no less excited, and he knew what caused his<br/>excitement.<br/><br/>"Allow me to tell you one little anecdote, gentlemen," Miusov<br/>said impressively, with a peculiarly majestic air. "Some years ago,<br/>soon after the coup d'etat of December, I happened to be calling in<br/>Paris on an extremely influential personage in the Government, and<br/>I met a very interesting man in his house. This individual was not<br/>precisely a detective but was a sort of superintendent of a whole<br/>regiment of political detectives- a rather powerful position in its<br/>own way. I was prompted by curiosity to seize the opportunity of<br/>conversation with him. And as he had not come as a visitor but as a<br/>subordinate official bringing a special report, and as he saw the<br/>reception given me by his chief, he deigned to speak with some<br/>openness, to a certain extent only, of course. He was rather<br/>courteous than open, as Frenchmen know how to be courteous,<br/>especially to a foreigner. But I thoroughly understood him. The<br/>subject was the socialist revolutionaries who were at that time<br/>persecuted. I will quote only one most curious remark dropped by<br/>this person. 'We are not particularly afraid,' said he, 'of all<br/>these socialists, anarchists, infidels, and revolutionists; we keep<br/>watch on them and know all their goings on. But there are a few<br/>peculiar men among them who believe in God and are Christians, but<br/>at the same time are socialists. These are the people we are most<br/>afraid of. They are dreadful people The socialist who is a<br/>Christian is more to be dreaded than a socialist who is an<br/>atheist.' The words struck me at the time, and now they have<br/>suddenly come back to me here, gentlemen."<br/><br/>"You apply them to us, and look upon us as socialists?" Father<br/>Paissy asked directly, without beating about the bush.<br/><br/>But before Pyotr Alexandrovitch could think what to answer, the<br/>door opened, and the guest so long expected, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,<br/>came in. They had, in fact, given up expecting him, and his sudden<br/>appearance caused some surprise for a moment.<br/><br/><br/><br/>
