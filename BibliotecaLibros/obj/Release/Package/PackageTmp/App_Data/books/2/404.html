<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>9<br/>They Carry Mitya Away<br/><br/><br/>WHEN the protocol had been signed, Nikolay Parfenovitch turned<br/>solemnly to the prisoner and read him the "Committal," setting<br/>forth, that in such a year, on such a day, in such a place, the<br/>investigating lawyer of such-and-such a district court, having<br/>examined so-and-so (to wit, Mitya) accused of this and of that (all<br/>the charges were carefully written out) and having considered that<br/>the accused, not pleading guilty to the charges made against him,<br/>had brought forward nothing in his defence, while the witnesses,<br/>so-and-so, and so-and-so, and the circumstances such-and-such<br/>testify against him, acting in accordance with such-and-such<br/>articles of the Statute Book, and so on, has ruled, that, in order<br/>to preclude so-and-so (Mitya) from all means of evading pursuit and<br/>judgment, he be detained in such-and-such a prison, which he hereby<br/>notifies to the accused and communicates a copy of this same<br/>"Committal" to the deputy prosecutor, and so on, and so on.<br/><br/>In brief, Mitya was informed that he was, from that moment, a<br/>prisoner, and that he would be driven at once to the town, and<br/>there shut up in a very unpleasant place. Mitya listened<br/>attentively, and only shrugged his shoulders.<br/><br/>"Well, gentlemen, I don't blame you. I'm ready… . I understand<br/>that there's nothing else for you to do."<br/><br/>Nikolay Parfenovitch informed him gently that he would be<br/>escorted at once by the rural police officer, Mavriky<br/>Mavrikyevitch, who happened to be on the spot… .<br/><br/>"Stay," Mitya interrupted, suddenly, and impelled by<br/>uncontrollable feeling he pronounced, addressing all in the<br/>room:<br/><br/>"Gentlemen, we're all cruel, we're all monsters, we all make men<br/>weep, and mothers, and babes at the breast, but of all, let it be<br/>settled here, now, of all I am the lowest reptile! I've sworn to<br/>amend, and every day I've done the same filthy things. I understand<br/>now that such men as I need a blow, a blow of destiny to catch them<br/>as with a noose, and bind them by a force from without. Never,<br/>never should I have risen of myself! But the thunderbolt has<br/>fallen. I accept the torture of accusation, and my public shame; I<br/>want to suffer and by suffering I shall be purified. Perhaps I<br/>shall be purified, gentlemen? But listen, for the last time, I am<br/>not guilty of my father's blood. I accept my punishment, not<br/>because I killed him, but because I meant to kill him, and perhaps<br/>I really might have killed him. Still I mean to fight it out with<br/>you. I warn you of that. I'll fight it out with you to the end, and<br/>then God will decide. Good-bye, gentlemen, don't be vexed with me<br/>for having shouted at you during the examination. Oh, I was still<br/>such a fool then… . In another minute I shall be a prisoner, but<br/>now, for the last time, as a free man, Dmitri Karamazov offers you<br/>his hand. Saying good-bye to you, I say it to all men."<br/><br/>His voice quivered and he stretched out his hand, but Nikolay<br/>Parfenovitch, who happened to stand nearest to him, with a sudden,<br/>almost nervous movement, hid his hands behind his back. Mitya<br/>instantly noticed this, and started. He let his outstretched hand<br/>fall at once.<br/>
