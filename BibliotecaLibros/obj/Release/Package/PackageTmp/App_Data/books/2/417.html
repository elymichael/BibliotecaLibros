<br/>"Brat?"<br/><br/>"Yes, a brat. What is it to you if I'm late; if I'm late, you<br/>may be sure I have good reason," muttered Agafya, busying herself<br/>about the stove, without a trace of anger or displeasure in her<br/>voice. She seemed quite pleased, in fact, to enjoy a skirmish with<br/>her merry young master.<br/><br/>"Listen, you frivolous young woman," Krassotkin began, getting<br/>up from the sofa, "can you swear by all you hold sacred in the<br/>world and something else besides, that you will watch vigilantly<br/>over the kids in my absence? I am going out."<br/><br/>"And what am I going to swear for?" laughed Agafya. "I shall<br/>look after them without that."<br/><br/>"No, you must swear on your eternal salvation. Else I shan't<br/>go."<br/><br/>"Well, don't then. What does it matter to me? It's cold out;<br/>stay at home."<br/><br/>"Kids," Kolya turned to the children, "this woman will stay with<br/>you till I come back or till your mother comes, for she ought to<br/>have been back long ago. She will give you some lunch, too. You'll<br/>give them something, Agafya, won't you?"<br/><br/>"That I can do."<br/><br/>"Good-bye, chickens, I go with my heart at rest. And you,<br/>granny," he added gravely, in an undertone, as he passed Agafya, "I<br/>hope you'll spare their tender years and not tell them any of your<br/>old woman's nonsense about Katerina. Ici, Perezvon!"<br/><br/>"Get along with you!" retorted Agafya, really angry this time.<br/>"Ridiculous boy! You want a whipping for saying such things, that's<br/>what you want!"<br/><br/>
