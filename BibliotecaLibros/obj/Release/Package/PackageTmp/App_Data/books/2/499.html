<br/>His chief feeling was one of relief at the fact that it was not<br/>Smerdyakov, but Mitya, who had committed the murder, though he<br/>might have been expected to feel the opposite. He did not want to<br/>analyse the reason for this feeling, and even felt a positive<br/>repugnance at prying into his sensations. He felt as though he<br/>wanted to make haste to forget something. In the following days he<br/>became convinced of Mitya's guilt, as he got to know all the weight<br/>of evidence against him. There was evidence of people of no<br/>importance, Fenya and her mother, for instance, but the effect of<br/>it was almost overpowering. As to Perhotin, the people at the<br/>tavern, and at Plotnikov's shop, as well as the witnesses at<br/>Mokroe, their evidence seemed conclusive. It was the details that<br/>were so damning. The secret of the knocks impressed the lawyers<br/>almost as much as Grigory's evidence as to the open door. Grigory's<br/>wife, Marfa, in answer to Ivan's questions, declared that<br/>Smerdyakov had been lying all night the other side of the partition<br/>wall, "He was not three paces from our bed," and that although she<br/>was a sound sleeper she waked several times and heard him moaning,<br/>"He was moaning the whole time, moaning continually."<br/><br/>Talking to Herzenstube, and giving it as his opinion that<br/>Smerdyakov was not mad, but only rather weak, Ivan only evoked from<br/>the old man a subtle smile.<br/><br/>"Do you know how he spends his time now?" he asked; "learning<br/>lists of French words by heart. He has an exercise-book under his<br/>pillow with the French words written out in Russian letters for him<br/>by someone, he he he!"<br/><br/>Ivan ended by dismissing all doubts. He could not think of<br/>Dmitri without repulsion. Only one thing was strange, however.<br/>Alyosha persisted that Dmitri was not the murderer, and that "in<br/>all probability" Smerdyakov was. Ivan always felt that Alyosha's<br/>opinion meant a great deal to him, and so he was astonished at it<br/>now. Another thing that was strange was that Alyosha did not make<br/>any attempt to talk about Mitya with Ivan, that he never began on<br/>the subject and only answered his questions. This, too, struck Ivan<br/>particularly.<br/><br/>But he was very much preoccupied at that time with something<br/>quite apart from that. On his return from Moscow, he abandoned<br/>himself hopelessly to his mad and consuming passion for Katerina<br/>Ivanovna. This is not the time to begin to speak of this new<br/>passion of Ivan's, which left its mark on all the rest of his life:<br/>this would furnish the subject for another novel, which I may<br/>perhaps never write. But I cannot omit to mention here that when<br/>Ivan, on leaving Katerina Ivanovna with Alyosha, as I've related<br/>already, told him, "I am not keen on her," it was an absolute lie:<br/>he loved her madly, though at times he hated her so that he might<br/>have murdered her. Many causes helped to bring about this feeling.<br/>Shattered by what had happened with Mitya, she rushed on Ivan's<br/>return to meet him as her one salvation. She was hurt, insulted and<br/>humiliated in her feelings. And here the man had come back to her,<br/>who had loved her so ardently before (oh! she knew that very well),<br/>and whose heart and intellect she considered so superior to her<br/>own. But the sternly virtuous girl did not abandon herself<br/>altogether to the man she loved, in spite of the Karamazov violence<br/>of his passions and the great fascination he had for her. She was<br/>continually tormented at the same time by remorse for having<br/>deserted Mitya, and in moments of discord and violent anger (and<br/>they were numerous) she told Ivan so plainly. This was what he had<br/>called to Alyosha "lies upon lies." There was, of course, much that<br/>was false in it, and that angered Ivan more than anything… . But of<br/>all this later.<br/><br/>He did, in fact, for a time almost forget Smerdyakov's<br/>existence, and yet, a fortnight after his first visit to him, he<br/>began to be haunted by the same strange thoughts as before. It's<br/>enough to say that he was continually asking himself, why was it<br/>that on that last night in Fyodor Pavlovitch's house he had crept<br/>out on to the stairs like a thief and listened to hear what his<br/>father was doing below? Why had he recalled that afterwards with<br/>repulsion? Why next morning, had he been suddenly so depressed on<br/>the journey? Why, as he reached Moscow, had he said to himself, "I<br/>am a scoundrel"? And now he almost fancied that these tormenting<br/>thoughts would make him even forget Katerina Ivanovna, so<br/>completely did they take possession of him again. It was just after<br/>fancying this, that he met Alyosha in the street. He stopped him at<br/>once, and put a question to him:<br/><br/>"Do you remember when Dmitri burst in after dinner and beat<br/>father, and afterwards I told you in the yard that I reserved 'the<br/>right to desire'?… Tell me, did you think then that I desired<br/>father's death or not?"<br/><br/>"I did think so," answered Alyosha, softly.<br/><br/>"It was so, too; it was not a matter of guessing. But didn't you<br/>fancy then that what I wished was just that one reptile should<br/>devour another'; that is, just that Dmitri should kill father, and<br/>as soon as possible… and that I myself was even prepared to help to<br/>bring that about?"<br/><br/>Alyosha turned rather pale, and looked silently into his<br/>brother's face.<br/><br/>
