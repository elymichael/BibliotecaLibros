"To father?"<br/><br/>"Yes, to father first. Ask him for three thousand."<br/><br/>"But, Mitya, he won't give it."<br/><br/>"As though he would! I know he won't. Do you know the meaning of<br/>despair, Alexey?"<br/><br/>"Yes."<br/><br/>"Listen. Legally he owes me nothing. I've had it all from him, I<br/>know that. But morally he owes me something, doesn't he? You know<br/>he started with twenty-eight thousand of my mother's money and made<br/>a hundred thousand with it. Let him give me back only three out of<br/>the twenty-eight thousand, and he'll draw my soul out of hell, and<br/>it will atone for many of his sins. For that three thousand- I give<br/>you my solemn word- I'll make an end of everything, and he shall<br/>hear nothing more of me. For the last time I give him the chance to<br/>be a father. Tell him God Himself sends him this chance."<br/><br/>"Mitya, he won't give it for anything."<br/><br/>"I know he won't. I know it perfectly well. Now, especially.<br/>That's not all. I know something more. Now, only a few days ago,<br/>perhaps only yesterday he found out for the first time in earnest<br/>(underline in earnest) that Grushenka is really perhaps not joking,<br/>and really means to marry me. He knows her nature; he knows the<br/>cat. And do you suppose he's going to give me money to help to<br/>bring that about when he's crazy about her himself? And that's not<br/>all, either. I can tell you more than that. I know that for the<br/>last five days he has had three thousand drawn out of the bank,<br/>changed into notes of a hundred roubles. packed into a large<br/>envelope, sealed with five seals, and tied across with red tape.<br/>You see how well I know all about it! On the envelope is written:<br/>'To my angel, Grushenka, when she will come to me.' He scrawled it<br/>himself in silence and in secret, and no one knows that the money's<br/>there except the valet, Smerdyakov, whom he trusts like himself. So<br/>now he has been expecting Grushenka for the last three or four<br/>days; he hopes she'll come for the money. He has sent her word of<br/>it, and she has sent him word that perhaps she'll come. And if she<br/>does go to the old man, can I marry her after that? You understand<br/>now why I'm here in secret and what I'm on the watch for."<br/><br/>"For her?"<br/><br/>"Yes, for her. Foma has a room in the house of these sluts here.<br/>Foma comes from our parts; he was a soldier in our regiment. He<br/>does jobs for them. He's watchman at night and goes grouse-shooting<br/>in the day-time; and that's how he lives. I've established myself<br/>in his room. Neither he nor the women of the house know the secret-<br/>that is, that I am on the watch here."<br/><br/>"No one but Smerdyakov knows, then?"<br/>
