Why Is Such a Man Alive?


DMITRI FYODOROVITCH, a young man of eight and twenty, of medium
height and agreeable countenance, looked older than his years. He
was muscular, and showed signs of considerable physical strength.
Yet there was something not healthy in his face. It was rather
thin, his cheeks were hollow, and there was an unhealthy sallowness
in their colour. His rather large, prominent, dark eyes had an
expression of firm determination, and yet there was a vague look in
them, too. Even when he was excited and talking irritably, his eyes
somehow did not follow his mood, but betrayed something else,
sometimes quite incongruous with what was passing. "It's hard to
tell what he's thinking," those who talked to him sometimes
declared. People who saw something pensive and sullen in his eyes
were startled by his sudden laugh, which bore witness to mirthful
and light-hearted thoughts at the very time when his eyes were so
gloomy. A certain strained look in his face was easy to understand
at this moment. Everyone knew, or had heard of, the extremely
restless and dissipated life which he had been leading of late, as
well as of the violent anger to which he had been roused in his
quarrels with his father. There were several stories current in the
town about it. It is true that he was irascible by nature, "of an
unstable and unbalanced mind," as our justice of the peace,
Katchalnikov, happily described him.

He was stylishly and irreproachably dressed in a carefully
buttoned frock-coat. He wore black gloves and carried a top hat.
Having only lately left the army, he still had moustaches and no
beard. His dark brown hair was cropped short, and combed forward on
his temples. He had the long, determined stride of a military man.
He stood still for a moment on the threshold, and glancing at the
whole party went straight up to the elder, guessing him to be their
host. He made him a low bow, and asked his blessing. Father
Zossima, rising in his chair, blessed him. Dmitri kissed his hand
respectfully, and with intense feeling, almost anger, he said:

"Be so generous as to forgive me for having kept you waiting so
long, but Smerdyakov, the valet sent me by my father, in reply to
my inquiries, told me twice over that the appointment was for one.
Now I suddenly learn- "

"Don't disturb yourself," interposed the elder. "No matter. You
are a little late. It's of no consequenceâ€¦ . "

"I'm extremely obliged to you, and expected no less from your
goodness."

Saying this, Dmitri bowed once more. Then, turning suddenly
towards his father, made him, too, a similarly low and respectful
bow. He had evidently considered it beforehand, and made this bow
in all seriousness, thinking it his duty to show his respect and
good intentions.

Although Fyodor Pavlovitch was taken unawares, he was equal to
the occasion. In response to Dmitri's bow he jumped up from his
chair and made his son a bow as low in return. His face was
suddenly solemn and impressive, which gave him a positively
malignant look. Dmitri bowed generally to all present, and without
a word walked to the window with his long, resolute stride, sat
down on the only empty chair, near Father Paissy, and, bending
forward, prepared to listen to the conversation he had
interrupted.
