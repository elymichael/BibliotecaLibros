The windows of his room looked out into the garden, and our<br/>garden was a shady one, with old trees in it which were coming into<br/>bud. The first birds of spring were flitting in the branches,<br/>chirruping and singing at the windows. And looking at them and<br/>admiring them, he began suddenly begging their forgiveness too:<br/>"Birds of heaven, happy birds, forgive me, for I have sinned<br/>against you too." None of us could understand that at the time, but<br/>he shed tears of joy. "Yes," he said, "there was such a glory of<br/>God all about me: birds, trees, meadows, sky; only I lived in shame<br/>and dishonoured it all and did not notice the beauty and<br/>glory."<br/><br/>"You take too many sins on yourself," mother used to say,<br/>weeping.<br/><br/>"Mother, darling, it's for joy, not for grief I am crying.<br/>Though I can't explain it to you, I like to humble myself before<br/>them, for I don't know how to love them enough. If I have sinned<br/>against everyone, yet all forgive me, too, and that's heaven. Am I<br/>not in heaven now?"<br/><br/>And there was a great deal more I don't remember. I remember I<br/>went once into his room when there was no one else there. It was a<br/>bright evening, the sun was setting, and the whole room was lighted<br/>up. He beckoned me, and I went up to him. He put his hands on my<br/>shoulders and looked into my face tenderly, lovingly; he said<br/>nothing for a minute, only looked at me like that.<br/><br/>"Well," he said, "run and play now, enjoy life for me too."<br/><br/>I went out then and ran to play. And many times in my life<br/>afterwards I remembered even with tears how he told me to enjoy<br/>life for him too. There were many other marvellous and beautiful<br/>sayings of his, though we did not understand them at the time. He<br/>died the third week after Easter. He was fully conscious though he<br/>could not talk; up to his last hour he did not change. He looked<br/>happy, his eyes beamed and sought us, he smiled at us, beckoned us.<br/>There was a great deal of talk even in the town about his death. I<br/>was impressed by all this at the time, but not too much so, though<br/>I cried a good deal at his funeral. I was young then, a child, but<br/>a lasting impression, a hidden feeling of it all, remained in my<br/>heart, ready to rise up and respond when the time came. So indeed<br/>it happened.<br/><br/>(b) Of the Holy Scriptures in the Life of Father Zossima.<br/><br/>I was left alone with my mother. Her friends began advising her<br/>to send me to Petersburg as other parents did. "You have only one<br/>son now," they said, "and have a fair income, and you will be<br/>depriving him perhaps of a brilliant career if you keep him here."<br/>They suggested I should be sent to Petersburg to the Cadet Corps,<br/>that I might afterwards enter the Imperial Guard. My mother<br/>hesitated for a long time, it was awful to part with her only<br/>child, but she made up her mind to it at last, though not without<br/>many tears, believing she was acting for my happiness. She brought<br/>me to Petersburg and put me into the Cadet Corps, and I never saw<br/>her again. For she too died three years afterwards. She spent those<br/>three years mourning and grieving for both of us.<br/><br/>From the house of my childhood I have brought nothing but<br/>precious memories, for there are no memories more precious than<br/>those of early childhood in one's first home. And that is almost<br/>always so if there is any love and harmony in the family at all.<br/>Indeed, precious memories may remain even of a bad home, if only<br/>the heart knows how to find what is precious. With my memories of<br/>home I count, too, my memories of the Bible, which, child as I was,<br/>I was very eager to read at home. I had a book of Scripture history<br/>then with excellent pictures, called A Hundred and Four Stories<br/>from the Old and New Testament, and I learned to read from it. I<br/>have it lying on my shelf now; I keep it as a precious relic of the<br/>past. But even before I learned to read, I remember first being<br/>moved to devotional feeling at eight years old. My mother took me<br/>alone to mass (I don't remember where my brother was at the time)<br/>on the Monday before Easter. It was a fine day, and I remember<br/>to-day, as though I saw it now, how the incense rose from the<br/>censer and softly floated upwards and, overhead in the cupola,<br/>mingled in rising waves with the sunlight that streamed in at the<br/>little window. I was stirred by the sight, and for the first time<br/>in my life I consciously received the seed of God's word in my<br/>heart. A youth came out into the middle of the church carrying a<br/>big book, so large that at the time I fancied he could scarcely<br/>carry it. He laid it on the reading desk, opened it, and began<br/>reading, and suddenly for the first time I understood something<br/>read in the church of God. In the land of Uz, there lived a man,<br/>righteous and God-fearing, and he had great wealth, so many camels,<br/>so many sheep and asses, and his children feasted, and he loved<br/>them very much and prayed for them. "It may be that my sons have<br/>sinned in their feasting." Now the devil came before the Lord<br/>together with the sons of God, and said to the Lord that he had<br/>gone up and down the earth and under the earth. "And hast thou<br/>considered my servant Job?" God asked of him. And God boasted to<br/>the devil, pointing to His great and holy servant. And the devil<br/>laughed at God's words. "Give him over to me and Thou wilt see that<br/>Thy servant will murmur against Thee and curse Thy name." And God<br/>gave up the just man He loved so, to the devil. And the devil smote<br/>his children and his cattle and scattered his wealth, all of a<br/>sudden like a thunderbolt from heaven. And Job rent his mantle and<br/>fell down upon the ground and cried aloud, "Naked came I out of my<br/>mother's womb, and naked shall I return into the earth; the Lord<br/>gave and the Lord has taken away. Blessed be the name of the Lord<br/>for ever and ever."<br/><br/>Fathers and teachers, forgive my tears now, for all my childhood<br/>rises up again before me, and I breathe now as I breathed then,<br/>with the breast of a little child of eight, and I feel as I did<br/>then, awe and wonder and gladness. The camels at that time caught<br/>my imagination, and Satan, who talked like that with God, and God<br/>who gave His servant up to destruction, and His servant crying out:<br/>"Blessed be Thy name although Thou dost punish me," and then the<br/>soft and sweet singing in the church: "Let my prayer rise up before<br/>Thee," and again incense from the priest's censer and the kneeling<br/>and the prayer. Ever since then- only yesterday I took it up- I've<br/>never been able to read that sacred tale without tears. And how<br/>much that is great, mysterious and unfathomable there is in it!<br/>Afterwards I heard the words of mockery and blame, proud words,<br/>"How could God give up the most loved of His saints for the<br/>diversion of the devil, take from him his children, smite him with<br/>sore boils so that he cleansed the corruption from his sores with a<br/>potsherd- and for no object except to boast to the devil 'See what<br/>My saint can suffer for My sake.' "But the greatness of it lies<br/>just in the fact that it is a mystery- that the passing earthly<br/>show and the eternal verity are brought together in it. In the face<br/>of the earthly truth, the eternal truth is accomplished. The<br/>Creator, just as on the first days of creation He ended each day<br/>with praise: "That is good that I have created," looks upon Job and<br/>again praises His creation. And Job, praising the Lord, serves not<br/>only Him but all His creation for generations and generations, and<br/>for ever and ever, since for that he was ordained. Good heavens,<br/>what a book it is, and what lessons there are in it! What a book<br/>the Bible is, what a miracle, what strength is given with it to<br/>man! It is like a mould cast of the world and man and human nature,<br/>everything is there, and a law for everything for all the ages. And<br/>what mysteries are solved and revealed! God raises Job again, gives<br/>him wealth again. Many years pass by, and he has other children and<br/>loves them. But how could he love those new ones when those first<br/>children are no more, when he has lost them? Remembering them, how<br/>could he be fully happy with those new ones, however dear the new<br/>ones might be? But he could, he could. It's the great mystery of<br/>human life that old grief passes gradually into quiet, tender joy.<br/>The mild serenity of age takes the place of the riotous blood of<br/>youth. I bless the rising sun each day, and, as before, my heart<br/>sings to meet it, but now I love even more its setting, its long<br/>slanting rays and the soft, tender, gentle memories that come with<br/>them, the dear images from the whole of my long, happy life- and<br/>over all the Divine Truth, softening, reconciling, forgiving! My<br/>life is ending, I know that well, but every day that is left me I<br/>feel how earthly life is in touch with a new infinite, unknown, but<br/>approaching life, the nearness of which sets my soul quivering with<br/>rapture, my mind glowing and my heart weeping with joy.<br/><br/>Friends and teachers, I have heard more than once, and of late<br/>one may hear it more often, that the priests, and above all the<br/>village priests, are complaining on all sides of their miserable<br/>income and their humiliating lot. They plainly state, even in<br/>print- I've read it myself- that they are unable to teach the<br/>Scriptures to the people because of the smallness of their means,<br/>and if Lutherans and heretics come and lead the flock astray, they<br/>let them lead them astray because they have so little to live upon.<br/>May the Lord increase the sustenance that is so precious to them,<br/>for their complaint is just, too. But of a truth I say, if anyone<br/>is to blame in the matter, half the fault is ours. For he may be<br/>short of time, he may say truly that he is overwhelmed all the<br/>while with work and services, but still it's not all the time, even<br/>he has an hour a week to remember God. And he does not work the<br/>whole year round. Let him gather round him once a week, some hour<br/>in the evening, if only the children at first- the fathers will<br/>hear of it and they too will begin to come. There's no need to<br/>build halls for this, let him take them into his own cottage. They<br/>won't spoil his cottage, they would only be there one hour. Let him<br/>open that book and begin reading it without grand words or<br/>superciliousness, without condescension to them, but gently and<br/>kindly, being glad that he is reading to them and that they are<br/>listening with attention, loving the words himself, only stopping<br/>from time to time to explain words that are not understood by the<br/>peasants. Don't be anxious, they will understand everything, the<br/>orthodox heart will understand all! Let him read them about Abraham<br/>and Sarah, about Isaac and Rebecca, of how Jacob went to Laban and<br/>wrestled with the Lord in his dream and said, "This place is holy"-<br/>and he will impress the devout mind of the peasant. Let him read,<br/>especially to the children, how the brothers sold Joseph, the<br/>tender boy, the dreamer and prophet, into bondage, and told their<br/>father that a wild beast had devoured him, and showed him his<br/>blood-stained clothes. Let him read them how the brothers<br/>afterwards journeyed into Egypt for corn, and Joseph, already a<br/>great ruler, unrecognised by them, tormented them, accused them,<br/>kept his brother Benjamin, and all through love: "I love you, and<br/>loving you I torment you." For he remembered all his life how they<br/>had sold him to the merchants in the burning desert by the well,<br/>and how, wringing his hands, he had wept and besought his brothers<br/>not to sell him as a slave in a strange land. And how, seeing them<br/>again after many years, he loved them beyond measure, but he<br/>harassed and tormented them in love. He left them at last not able<br/>to bear the suffering of his heart, flung himself on his bed and<br/>wept. Then, wiping his tears away, he went out to them joyful and<br/>told them, "Brothers, I am your brother Joseph" Let him read them<br/>further how happy old Jacob was on learning that his darling boy<br/>was still alive, and how he went to Egypt leaving his own country,<br/>and died in a foreign land, bequeathing his great prophecy that had<br/>lain mysteriously hidden in his meek and timid heart all his life,<br/>that from his offspring, from Judah, will come the great hope of<br/>the world, the Messiah and Saviour.<br/>
