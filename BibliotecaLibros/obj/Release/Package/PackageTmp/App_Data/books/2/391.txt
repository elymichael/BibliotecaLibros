"Yes, what you said just now," said Nikolay Parfenovitch,
looking at him surprise, "that is, that up to the last hour you
were still contemplating going to Katerina Ivanovna to beg that sum
from her… . I assure you, that's a very important piece of evidence
for us, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, I mean for the whole case… and
particularly for you, particularly important for you."

"Have mercy, gentlemen!" Mitya flung up his hands. "Don't write
that, anyway; have some shame. Here I've torn my heart asunder
before you, and you seize the opportunity and are fingering the
wounds in both halves… . Oh, my God!"

In despair he hid his face in his hands.

"Don't worry yourself so, Dmitri Fyodorovitch," observed the
prosecutor, "everything that is written down will be read over to
you afterwards, and what you don't agree to we'll alter as you
like. But now I'll ask you one little question for the second time.
Has no one, absolutely no one, heard from you of that money you
sewed up? That, I must tell you, is almost impossible to
believe."

"No one, no one, I told you so before, or you've not understood
anything! Let me alone!"

"Very well, this matter is bound to be explained, and there's
plenty of time for it, but meantime, consider; we have perhaps a
dozen witnesses that you yourself spread it abroad, and even
shouted almost everywhere about the three thousand you'd spent
here; three thousand, not fifteen hundred. And now, too, when you
got hold of the money you had yesterday, you gave many people to
understand that you had brought three thousand with you."

"You've got not dozens, but hundreds of witnesses, two hundred
witnesses, two hundred have heard it, thousands have heard it!"
cried Mitya.

"Well, you see, all bear witness to it. And the word all means
something."

"It means nothing. I talked rot, and everyone began repeating
it."

"But what need had you to 'talk rot,' as you call it?"
