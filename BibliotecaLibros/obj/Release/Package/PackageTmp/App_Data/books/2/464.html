"What do you think yourself?"<br/><br/>"What do I think? It's the end for me, that's what I think. They<br/>all three have been plotting my end, for Katerina's in it. It's all<br/>Katerina, it all comes from her. She is this and that, and that<br/>means that I am not. He tells me that beforehand- warns me. He is<br/>planning to throw me over, that's the whole secret. They've planned<br/>it together, the three of them- Mitya, Katerina, and Ivan<br/>Fyodorovitch. Alyosha, I've been wanting to ask you a long time. A<br/>week ago he suddenly told me that Ivan was in love with Katerina,<br/>because he often goes to see her. Did he tell me the truth or not?<br/>Tell me, on your conscience, tell me the worst."<br/><br/>"I won't tell you a lie. Ivan is not in love with Katerina<br/>Ivanovna, I think."<br/><br/>"Oh, that's what I thought! He is lying to me, shameless<br/>deceiver, that's what it is! And he was jealous of me just now, so<br/>as to put the blame on me afterwards. He is stupid, he can't<br/>disguise what he is doing; he is so open, you know… . But I'll give<br/>it to him, I'll give it to him! 'You believe I did it,' he said. He<br/>said that to me, to me. He reproached me with that! God forgive<br/>him! You wait, I'll make it hot for Katerina at the trial! I'll<br/>just say a word then… I'll tell everything then!" And again she<br/>cried bitterly.<br/><br/>"This I can tell you for certain, Grushenka," Alyosha said,<br/>getting up. "First, that he loves you, loves you more than anyone<br/>in the world, and you only, believe me. I know. I do know. The<br/>second thing is that I don't want to worm his secret out of him,<br/>but if he'll tell me of himself to-day, I shall tell him straight<br/>out that I have promised to tell you. Then I'll come to you to-day<br/>and tell you. Only… I fancy… Katerina Ivanovna has nothing to do<br/>with it, and that the secret is about something else. That's<br/>certain. It isn't likely it's about Katerina Ivanovna, it seems to<br/>me. Good-bye for now."<br/><br/>Alyosha shook hands with her. Grushenka was still crying. He saw<br/>that she put little faith in his consolation, but she was better<br/>for having had her sorrow out, for having spoken of it. He was<br/>sorry to leave her in such a state of mind, but he was in haste. He<br/>had a great many things to do still.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
