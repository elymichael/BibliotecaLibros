"Yes, I want disorder. I keep wanting to set fire to the house.
I keep imagining how I'll creep up and set fire to the house on the
sly; it must be on the sly. They'll try to put it out, but it'll go
on burning. And I shall know and say nothing. Ah, what silliness!
And how bored I am!"

She waved her hand with a look of repulsion.

"It's your luxurious life," said Alyosha, softly"

"Is it better, then, to be poor?"

"Yes, it is better."

"That's what your monk taught you. That's not true. Let me be
rich and all the rest poor, I'll eat sweets and drink cream and not
give any to anyone else. Ach, don't speak, don't say anything"; she
shook her hand at him, though Alyosha had not opened his mouth.
"You've told me all that before, I know it all by heart. It bores
me. If I am ever poor, I shall murder somebody, and even if I am
rich, I may murder someone, perhaps- why do nothing! But do you
know, I should like to reap, cut the rye? I'll marry you, and you
shall become a peasant, a real peasant; we'll keep a colt, shall
we? Do you know Kalganov?"

"Yes."

"He is always wandering about, dreaming. He says, 'Why live in
real life? It's better to dream. One can dream the most delightful
things, but real life is a bore.' But he'll be married soon for all
that; he's been making love to me already. Can you spin tops?"

"Yes."

"Well, he's just like a top: he wants to be wound up and set
spinning and then to be lashed, lashed, lashed with a whip. If I
marry him, I'll keep him spinning all his life. You are not ashamed
to be with me?"

"No."
