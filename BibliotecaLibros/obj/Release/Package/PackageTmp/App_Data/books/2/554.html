"What do you mean by that?" the President asked severely.<br/><br/>"Why, this," Ivan suddenly pulled out a roll of notes. "Here's<br/>the money… the notes that lay in that envelope" (he nodded towards<br/>the table on which lay the material evidence), "for the sake of<br/>which our father was murdered. Where shall I put them? Mr.<br/>Superintendent, take them."<br/><br/>The usher of the court took the whole roll and handed it to the<br/>President.<br/><br/>"How could this money have come into your possession if it is<br/>the same money?" the President asked wonderingly.<br/><br/>"I got them from Smerdyakov, from the murderer, yesterday… . I<br/>was with him just before he hanged himself. It was he, not my<br/>brother, killed our father. He murdered him and I incited him to do<br/>it… Who doesn't desire his father's death?"<br/><br/>"Are you in your right mind?" broke involuntarily from the<br/>President.<br/><br/>"I should think I am in my right mind… in the same nasty mind as<br/>all of you… as all these… ugly faces." He turned suddenly to the<br/>audience. "My father has been murdered and they pretend they are<br/>horrified," he snarled, with furious contempt. "They keep up the<br/>sham with one another. Liars! They all desire the death of their<br/>fathers. One reptile devours another… . If there hadn't been a<br/>murder, they'd have been angry and gone home ill-humoured. It's a<br/>spectacle they want! Panem et circenses.<br/>[19]<br/>Though I<br/>am one to talk! Have you any water? Give me a drink for Christ's<br/>sake!" He suddenly clutched his head. The usher at once approached<br/>him. Alyosha jumped up and cried, "He is ill. Don't believe him: he<br/>has brain fever." Katerina Ivanovna rose impulsively from her seat<br/>and, rigid with horror, gazed at Ivan. Mitya stood up and greedily<br/>looked at his brother and listened to him with a wild, strange<br/>smile. "Don't disturb yourselves. I am not mad, I am only a<br/>murderer," Ivan began again. "You can't expect eloquence from a<br/>murderer," he added suddenly for some reason and laughed a queer<br/>laugh. The prosecutor bent over to the President in obvious dismay.<br/>The two other judges communicated in agitated whispers.<br/>Fetyukovitch pricked up his ears as he listened: the hall was<br/>hushed in expectation. The President seemed suddenly to recollect<br/>himself. "Witness, your words are incomprehensible and impossible<br/>here. Calm yourself, if you can, and tell your story… if you really<br/>have something to tell. How can you confirm your statement… if<br/>indeed you are not delirious?" "That's just it. I have no proof.<br/>That cur Smerdyakov won't send you proofs from the other world… in<br/>an envelope. You think of nothing but envelopes- one is enough.<br/>I've no witnesses… except one, perhaps," he smiled thoughtfully.<br/>"Who is your witness?" "He has a tail, your excellency, and that<br/>would be irregular! Le diable n'existe point! Don't pay attention:<br/>he is a paltry, pitiful devil," he added suddenly. He ceased<br/>laughing and spoke as it were, confidentially. "He is here<br/>somewhere, no doubt- under that table with the material evidence on<br/>it, perhaps. Where should he sit if not there? You see, listen to<br/>me. I told him I don't want to keep quiet, and he talked about the<br/>geological cataclysm… idiocy! Come, release the monster… he's been<br/>singing a hymn. That's because his heart is light! It's like a<br/>drunken man in the street bawling how 'Vanka went to Petersburg,'<br/>and I would give a quadrillion quadrillions for two seconds of joy.<br/>You don't know me! Oh, how stupid all this business is! Come, take<br/>me instead of him! I didn't come for nothing… . Why, why is<br/>everything so stupid?… " And he began slowly, and as it were<br/>reflectively, looking round him again. But the court was all<br/>excitement by now. Alyosha rushed towards him, but the court usher<br/>had already seized Ivan by the arm. "What are you about?" he cried,<br/>staring into the man's face, and suddenly seizing him by the<br/>shoulders, he flung him violently to the floor. But the police were<br/>on the spot and he was seized. He screamed furiously. And all the<br/>time he was being removed, he yelled and screamed something<br/>incoherent. The whole court was thrown into confusion. I don't<br/>remember everything as it happened. I was excited myself and could<br/>not follow. I only know that afterwards, when everything was quiet<br/>again and everyone understood what had happened, the court usher<br/>came in for a reprimand, though he very reasonably explained that<br/>the witness had been quite well, that the doctor had seen him an<br/>hour ago, when he had a slight attack of giddiness, but that, until<br/>he had come into the court, he had talked quite consecutively, so<br/>that nothing could have been foreseen- that he had, in fact,<br/>insisted on giving evidence. But before everyone had completely<br/>regained their composure and recovered from this scene, it was<br/>followed by another. Katerina Ivanovna had an attack of hysterics.<br/>She sobbed, shrieking loudly, but refused to leave the court,<br/>struggled, and besought them not to remove her. Suddenly she cried<br/>to the President: "There is more evidence I must give at<br/>once&#160;… at once! Here is a document, a letter… take it, read it<br/>quickly, quickly! It's a letter from that monster… that man there,<br/>there!" she pointed to Mitya. "It was he killed his father, you<br/>will see that directly. He wrote to me how he would kill his<br/>father! But the other one is ill, he is ill, he is delirious!" she<br/>kept crying out, beside herself. The court usher took the document<br/>she held out to the President, and she, dropping into her chair,<br/>hiding her face in her hands, began convulsively and noiselessly<br/>sobbing, shaking all over, and stifling every sound for fear she<br/>should be ejected from the court. The document she had handed up<br/>was that letter Mitya had written at the Metropolis tavern, which<br/>Ivan had spoken of as a "mathematical proof." Alas! its<br/>mathematical conclusiveness was recognised, and had it not been for<br/>that letter, Mitya might have escaped his doom or, at least, that<br/>doom would have been less terrible. It was, I repeat, difficult to<br/>notice every detail. What followed is still confused to my mind.<br/>The President must, I suppose, have at once passed on the document<br/>to the judges, the jury, and the lawyers on both sides. I only<br/>remember how they began examining the witness. On being gently<br/>asked by the President whether she had recovered sufficiently,<br/>Katerina Ivanovna exclaimed impetuously: "I am ready, I am ready! I<br/>am quite equal to answering you," she added, evidently still afraid<br/>that she would somehow be prevented from giving evidence. She was<br/>asked to explain in detail what this letter was and under what<br/>circumstances she received it. "I received it the day before the<br/>crime was committed, but he wrote it the day before that, at the<br/>tavern- that is, two days before he committed the crime. Look, it<br/>is written on some sort of bill!" she cried breathlessly. "He hated<br/>me at that time, because he had behaved contemptibly and was<br/>running after that creature&#160;… and because he owed me that<br/>three thousand… . Oh! he was humiliated by that three thousand on<br/>account of his own meanness! This is how it happened about that<br/>three thousand. I beg you, I beseech you, to hear me. Three weeks<br/>before he murdered his father, he came to me one morning. I knew he<br/>was in want of money, and what he wanted it for. Yes, yes- to win<br/>that creature and carry her off. I knew then that he had been false<br/>to me and meant to abandon me, and it was I, I, who gave him that<br/>money, who offered it to him on the pretext of his sending it to my<br/>sister in Moscow. And as I gave it him, I looked him in the face<br/>and said that he could send it when he liked, 'in a month's time<br/>would do.' How, how could he have failed to understand that I was<br/>practically telling him to his face, 'You want money to be false to<br/>me with your creature, so here's the money for you. I give it to<br/>you myself. Take it, if you have so little honour as to take it!' I<br/>wanted to prove what he was, and what happened? He took it, he took<br/>it, and squandered it with that creature in one night… . But he<br/>knew, he knew that I knew all about it. I assure you he understood,<br/>too, that I gave him that money to test him, to see whether he was<br/>so lost to all sense of honour as to take it from me. I looked into<br/>his eyes and he looked into mine, and he understood it all and he<br/>took it- he carried off my money! "That's true, Katya," Mitya<br/>roared suddenly, "I looked into your eyes and I knew that you were<br/>dishonouring me, and yet I took your money. Despise me as a<br/>scoundrel, despise me, all of you! I've deserved it!" "Prisoner,"<br/>cried the President, "another word and I will order you to be<br/>removed." "That money was a torment to him," Katya went on with<br/>impulsive haste. "He wanted to repay it me. He wanted to, that's<br/>true; but he needed money for that creature, too. So he murdered<br/>his father, but he didn't repay me, and went off with her to that<br/>village where he was arrested. There, again, he squandered the<br/>money he had stolen after the murder of his father. And a day<br/>before the murder he wrote me this letter. He was drunk when he<br/>wrote it. I saw it at once, at the time. He wrote it from spite,<br/>and feeling certain, positively certain, that I should never show<br/>it to anyone, even if he did kill him, or else he wouldn't have<br/>written it. For he knew I shouldn't want to revenge myself and ruin<br/>him! But read it, read it attentively- more attentively, please-<br/>and you will see that he had described it all in his letter, all<br/>beforehand, how he would kill his father and where his money was<br/>kept. Look, please, don't overlook that, there's one phrase there,<br/>'I shall kill him as soon as Ivan has gone away.' he thought it all<br/>out beforehand how he would kill him," Katerina Ivanovna pointed<br/>out to the court with venomous and malignant triumph. Oh! it was<br/>clear she had studied every line of that letter and detected every<br/>meaning underlining it. "If he hadn't been drunk, he wouldn't have<br/>written to me; but, look, everything is written there beforehand,<br/>just as he committed the murder after. A complete programme of it!"<br/>she exclaimed frantically. She was reckless now of all consequences<br/>to herself, though, no doubt, she had foreseen them even a month<br/>ago, for even then, perhaps, shaking with anger, she had pondered<br/>whether to show it at the trial or not. Now she had taken the fatal<br/>plunge. I remember that the letter was read aloud by the clerk,<br/>directly afterwards, I believe. It made an overwhelming impression.<br/>They asked Mitya whether he admitted having written the letter.<br/>"It's mine, mine!" cried Mitya. "I shouldn't have written it if I<br/>hadn't been drunk!… We've hated each other for many things, Katya,<br/>but I swear, I swear I loved you even while I hated you, and you<br/>didn't love me!" He sank back on his seat, wringing his hands in<br/>despair. The prosecutor and counsel for the defence began<br/>cross-examining her, chiefly to ascertain what had induced her to<br/>conceal such a document and to give her evidence in quite a<br/>different tone and spirit just before. "Yes, yes. I was telling<br/>lies just now. I was lying against my honour and my conscience, but<br/>I wanted to save him, for he has hated and despised me so!" Katya<br/>cried madly. "Oh, he has despised me horribly, he has always<br/>despised me, and do you know, he has despised me from the very<br/>moment that I bowed down to him for that money. I saw that… . I<br/>felt it at once at the time, but for a long time I wouldn't believe<br/>it. How often I have read it in his eyes, 'You came of yourself,<br/>though.' Oh, he didn't understand, he had no idea why I ran to him,<br/>he can suspect nothing but baseness, he judged me by himself, he<br/>thought everyone was like himself!" Katya hissed furiously, in a<br/>perfect frenzy. "And he only wanted to marry me, because I'd<br/>inherited a fortune, because of that, because of that! I always<br/>suspected it was because of that! Oh, he is a brute! He was always<br/>convinced that I should be trembling with shame all my life before<br/>him, because I went to him then, and that he had a right to despise<br/>me forever for it, and so to be superior to me- that's why he<br/>wanted to marry me! That's so, that's all so! I tried to conquer<br/>him by my love- a love that knew no bounds. I even tried to forgive<br/>his faithlessness; but he understood nothing, nothing! How could he<br/>understand indeed? He is a monster! I only received that letter the<br/>next evening: it was brought me from the tavern- and only that<br/>morning, only that morning I wanted to forgive him everything,<br/>everything- even his treachery!" The President and the prosecutor,<br/>of course, tried to calm her. I can't help thinking that they felt<br/>ashamed of taking advantage of her hysteria and of listening to<br/>such avowals. I remember hearing them say to her, "We understand<br/>how hard it is for you; be sure we are able to feel for you," and<br/>so on, and so on. And yet they dragged the evidence out of the<br/>raving, hysterical woman. She described at last with extraordinary<br/>clearness, which is so often seen, though only for a moment, in<br/>such overwrought states, how Ivan had been nearly driven out of his<br/>mind during the last two months trying to save "the monster and<br/>murderer," his brother. "He tortured himself," she exclaimed, "he<br/>was always trying to minimise his brother's guilt and confessing to<br/>me that he, too, had never loved his father, and perhaps desired<br/>his death himself. Oh, he has a tender, over-tender conscience! He<br/>tormented himself with his conscience! He told me everything,<br/>everything! He came every day and talked to me as his only friend.<br/>I have the honour to be his only friend!" she cried suddenly with a<br/>sort of defiance, and her eyes flashed. "He had been twice to see<br/>Smerdyakov. One day he came to me and said, 'If it was not my<br/>brother, but Smerdyakov committed the murder' (for the legend was<br/>circulating everywhere that Smerdyakov had done it), 'perhaps I too<br/>am guilty, for Smerdyakov knew I didn't like my father and perhaps<br/>believed that I desired my father's death.' Then I brought out that<br/>letter and showed it him. He was entirely convinced that his<br/>brother had done it, and he was overwhelmed by it. He couldn't<br/>endure the thought that his own brother was a parricide! Only a<br/>week ago I saw that it was making him ill. During the last few days<br/>he has talked incoherently in my presence. I saw his mind was<br/>giving way. He walked about, raving; he was seen muttering in the<br/>streets. The doctor from Moscow, at my request, examined him the<br/>day before yesterday and told me that he was on the eve of brain<br/>fever- and all on his account, on account of this monster! And last<br/>night he learnt that Smerdyakov was dead! It was such a shock that<br/>it drove him out of his mind… and all through this monster, all for<br/>the sake of saving the monster!" Oh, of course, such an outpouring,<br/>such an avowal is only possible once in a lifetime- at the hour of<br/>death, for instance, on the way to the scaffold! But it was in<br/>Katya's character, and it was such a moment in her life. It was the<br/>same impetuous Katya who had thrown herself on the mercy of a young<br/>profligate to save her father; the same Katya who had just before,<br/>in her pride and chastity, sacrificed herself and her maidenly<br/>modesty before all these people, telling of Mitya's generous<br/>conduct, in the hope of softening his fate a little. And now,<br/>again, she sacrificed herself; but this time it was for another,<br/>and perhaps only now- perhaps only at this moment- she felt and<br/>knew how dear that other was to her! She had sacrificed herself in<br/>terror for him; conceiving all of a sudden that he had ruined<br/>himself by his confession that it was he who had committed the<br/>murder, not his brother, she had sacrificed herself to save him, to<br/>save his good name, his reputation! And yet one terrible doubt<br/>occurred to one- was she lying in her description of her former<br/>relations with Mitya?- that was the question. No, she had not<br/>intentionally slandered him when she cried that Mitya despised her<br/>for her bowing down to him! She believed it herself. She had been<br/>firmly convinced, perhaps ever since that bow, that the<br/>simplehearted Mitya, who even then adored her, was laughing at her<br/>and despising her. She had loved him with an hysterical,<br/>"lacerated" love only from pride, from wounded pride, and that love<br/>was not like love, but more like revenge. Oh! perhaps that<br/>lacerated love would have grown into real love, perhaps Katya<br/>longed for nothing more than that, but Mitya's faithlessness had<br/>wounded her to the bottom of her heart, and her heart could not<br/>forgive him. The moment of revenge had come upon her suddenly, and<br/>all that had been accumulating so long and so painfully in the<br/>offended woman's breast burst out all at once and unexpectedly. She<br/>betrayed Mitya, but she betrayed herself, too. And no sooner had<br/>she given full expression to her feelings than the tension of<br/>course was over and she was overwhelmed with shame. Hysterics began<br/>again: she fell on the floor, sobbing and screaming. She was<br/>carried out. At that moment Grushenka, with a wail, rushed towards<br/>Mitya before they had time to prevent her. "Mitya," she wailed,<br/>"your serpent has destroyed you! There, she has shown you what she<br/>is!" she shouted to the judges, shaking with anger. At a signal<br/>from the President they seized her and tried to remove her from the<br/>court. She wouldn't allow it. She fought and struggled to get back<br/>to Mitya. Mitya uttered a cry and struggled to get to her. He was<br/>overpowered. Yes, I think the ladies who came to see the spectacle<br/>must have been satisfied- the show had been a varied one. Then I<br/>remember the Moscow doctor appeared on the scene. I believe the<br/>President had previously sent the court usher to arrange for<br/>medical aid for Ivan. The doctor announced to the court that the<br/>sick man was suffering from a dangerous attack of brain fever, and<br/>that he must be at once removed. In answer to questions from the<br/>prosecutor and the counsel for the defence he said that the patient<br/>had come to him of his own accord the day before yesterday and that<br/>he had warned him that he had such an attack coming on, but he had<br/>not consented to be looked after. "He was certainly not in a normal<br/>state of mind: he told me himself that he saw visions when he was<br/>awake, that he met several persons in the street, who were dead,<br/>and that Satan visited him every evening," said the doctor, in<br/>conclusion. Having given his evidence, the celebrated doctor<br/>withdrew. The letter produced by Katerina Ivanovna was added to the<br/>material proofs. After some deliberation, the judges decided to<br/>proceed with the trial and to enter both the unexpected pieces of<br/>evidence (given by Ivan and Katerina Ivanovna) on the protocol. But<br/>I will not detail the evidence of the other witnesses, who only<br/>repeated and confirmed what had been said before, though all with<br/>their characteristic peculiarities. I repeat, all was brought<br/>together in the prosecutor's speech, which I shall quote<br/>immediately. Everyone was excited, everyone was electrified by the<br/>late catastrophe, and all were awaiting the speeches for the<br/>prosecution and the defence with intense impatience. Fetyukovitch<br/>was obviously shaken by Katerina Ivanovna's evidence. But the<br/>prosecutor was triumphant. When all the evidence had been taken,<br/>the court was adjourned for almost an hour. I believe it was just<br/>eight o'clock when the President returned to his seat and our<br/>prosecutor, Ippolit Kirillovitch, began his speech.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
