<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>12<br/>And There Was No Murder Either<br/><br/><br/>"ALLOW me, gentlemen of the jury, to remind you that a man's<br/>life is at stake and that you must be careful. We have heard the<br/>prosecutor himself admit that until to-day he hesitated to accuse<br/>the prisoner of a full and conscious premeditation of the crime; he<br/>hesitated till he saw that fatal drunken letter which was produced<br/>in court to-day. 'All was done as written.' But, I repeat again, he<br/>was running to her, to seek her, solely to find out where she was.<br/>That's a fact that can't be disputed. Had she been at home, he<br/>would not have run away, but would have remained at her side, and<br/>so would not have done what he promised in the letter. He ran<br/>unexpectedly and accidentally, and by that time very likely he did<br/>not even remember his drunken letter. 'He snatched up the pestle,'<br/>they say, and you will remember how a whole edifice of psychology<br/>was built on that pestle- why he was bound to look at that pestle<br/>as a weapon, to snatch it up, and so on, and so on. A very<br/>commonplace idea occurs to me at this point: What if that pestle<br/>had not been in sight, had not been lying on the shelf from which<br/>it was snatched by the prisoner, but had been put away in a<br/>cupboard? It would not have caught the prisoner's eye, and he would<br/>have run away without a weapon, with empty hands, and then he would<br/>certainly not have killed anyone. How then can I look upon the<br/>pestle as a proof of premeditation?<br/><br/>"Yes, but he talked in the taverns of murdering his father, and<br/>two days before, on the evening when he wrote his drunken letter,<br/>he was quiet and only quarrelled with a shopman in the tavern,<br/>because a Karamazov could not help quarrelling, forsooth! But my<br/>answer to that is, that, if he was planning such a murder in<br/>accordance with his letter, he certainly would not have quarrelled<br/>even with a shopman, and probably would not have gone into the<br/>tavern at all, because a person plotting such a crime seeks quiet<br/>and retirement, seeks to efface himself, to avoid being seen and<br/>heard, and that not from calculation, but from instinct. Gentlemen<br/>of the jury, the psychological method is a two-edged weapon, and<br/>we, too, can use it. As for all this shouting in taverns throughout<br/>the month, don't we often hear children, or drunkards coming out of<br/>taverns shout, 'I'll kill you'? but they don't murder anyone. And<br/>that fatal letter- isn't that simply drunken irritability, too?<br/>Isn't that simply the shout of the brawler outside the tavern,<br/>'I'll kill you! I'll kill the lot of you!' Why not, why could it<br/>not be that? What reason have we to call that letter 'fatal' rather<br/>than absurd? Because his father has been found murdered, because a<br/>witness saw the prisoner running out of the garden with a weapon in<br/>his hand, and was knocked down by him: therefore, we are told,<br/>everything was done as he had planned in writing, and the letter<br/>was not 'absurd,' but 'fatal.'<br/><br/>"Now, thank God! we've come to the real point: 'since he was in<br/>the garden, he must have murdered him.' In those few words: 'since<br/>he was, then he must' lies the whole case for the prosecution. He<br/>was there, so he must have. And what if there is no must about it,<br/>even if he was there? Oh, I admit that the chain of evidence- the<br/>coincidences- are really suggestive. But examine all these facts<br/>separately, regardless of their connection. Why, for instance, does<br/>the prosecution refuse to admit the truth of the prisoner's<br/>statement that he ran away from his father's window? Remember the<br/>sarcasms in which the prosecutor indulged at the expense of the<br/>respectful and 'pious' sentiments which suddenly came over the<br/>murderer. But what if there were something of the sort, a feeling<br/>of religious awe, if not of filial respect? 'My mother must have<br/>been praying for me at that moment,' were the prisoner's words at<br/>the preliminary inquiry, and so he ran away as soon as he convinced<br/>himself that Madame Svyetlov was not in his father's house. 'But he<br/>could not convince himself by looking through the window,' the<br/>prosecutor objects. But why couldn't he? Why? The window opened at<br/>the signals given by the prisoner. Some word might have been<br/>uttered by Fyodor Pavlovitch, some exclamation which showed the<br/>prisoner that she was not there. Why should we assume everything as<br/>we imagine it, as we make up our minds to imagine it? A thousand<br/>things may happen in reality which elude the subtlest<br/>imagination.<br/><br/>"'Yes, but Grigory saw the door open and so the prisoner<br/>certainly was in the house, therefore he killed him.' Now about<br/>that door, gentlemen of the juryâ€¦ . Observe that we have only the<br/>statement of one witness as to that door, and he was at the time in<br/>such a condition, that- but supposing the door was open; supposing<br/>the prisoner has lied in denying it, from an instinct of<br/>self-defence, natural in his position; supposing he did go into the<br/>house- well, what then? How does it follow that because he was<br/>there he committed the murder? He might have dashed in, run through<br/>the rooms; might have pushed his father away; might have struck<br/>him; but as soon as he had made sure Madame Svyetlov was not there,<br/>he may have run away rejoicing that she was not there and that he<br/>had not killed his father. And it was perhaps just because he had<br/>escaped from the temptation to kill his father, because he had a<br/>clear conscience and was rejoicing at not having killed him, that<br/>he was capable of a pure feeling, the feeling of pity and<br/>compassion, and leapt off the fence a minute later to the<br/>assistance of Grigory after he had, in his excitement, knocked him<br/>down.<br/><br/>"With terrible eloquence the prosecutor has described to us the<br/>dreadful state of the prisoner's mind at Mokroe when love again lay<br/>before him calling him to new life, while love was impossible for<br/>him because he had his father's bloodstained corpse behind him and<br/>beyond that corpse- retribution. And yet the prosecutor allowed him<br/>love, which he explained, according to his method, talking about<br/>this drunken condition, about a criminal being taken to execution,<br/>about it being still far off, and so on and so on. But again I ask,<br/>Mr. Prosecutor, have you not invented a new personality? Is the<br/>prisoner so coarse and heartless as to be able to think at that<br/>moment of love and of dodges to escape punishment, if his hands<br/>were really stained with his father's blood? No, no, no! As soon as<br/>it was made plain to him that she loved him and called him to her<br/>side, promising him new happiness, oh! then, I protest he must have<br/>felt the impulse to suicide doubled, trebled, and must have killed<br/>himself, if he had his father's murder on his conscience. Oh, no!<br/>he would not have forgotten where his pistols lay! I know the<br/>prisoner: the savage, stony heartlessness ascribed to him by the<br/>prosecutor is inconsistent with his character. He would have killed<br/>himself, that's certain. He did not kill himself just because 'his<br/>mother's prayers had saved him,' and he was innocent of his<br/>father's blood. He was troubled, he was grieving that night at<br/>Mokroe only about old Grigory and praying to God that the old man<br/>would recover, that his blow had not been fatal, and that he would<br/>not have to suffer for it. Why not accept such an interpretation of<br/>the facts? What trustworthy proof have we that the prisoner is<br/>lying?<br/><br/>"But we shall be told at once again, 'There is his father's<br/>corpse! If he ran away without murdering him, who did murder him?'<br/>Here, I repeat, you have the whole logic of the prosecution. Who<br/>murdered him, if not he? There's no one to put in his place.<br/><br/>"Gentlemen of the jury, is that really so? Is it positively,<br/>actually true that there is no one else at all? We've heard the<br/>prosecutor count on his fingers all the persons who were in that<br/>house that night. They were five in number; three of them, I agree,<br/>could not have been responsible- the murdered man himself, old<br/>Grigory, and his wife. There are left then the prisoner and<br/>Smerdyakov, and the prosecutor dramatically exclaims that the<br/>prisoner pointed to Smerdyakov because he had no one else to fix<br/>on, that had there been a sixth person, even a phantom of a sixth<br/>person, he would have abandoned the charge against Smerdyakov at<br/>once in shame and have accused that other. But, gentlemen of the<br/>jury, why may I not draw the very opposite conclusion? There are<br/>two persons- the prisoner and Smerdyakov. Why can I not say that<br/>you accuse my client, simply because you have no one else to<br/>accuse? And you have no one else only because you have determined<br/>to exclude Smerdyakov from all suspicion.<br/>
