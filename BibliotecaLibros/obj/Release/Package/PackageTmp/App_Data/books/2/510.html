<br/>It was over-heated as before, but there were changes in the<br/>room. One of the benches at the side had been removed, and in its<br/>place had been put a large old mahogany leather sofa, on which a<br/>bed had been made up, with fairly clean white pillows. Smerdyakov<br/>was sitting on the sofa, wearing the same dressing-gown. The table<br/>had been brought out in front of the sofa, so that there was hardly<br/>room to move. On the table lay a thick book in yellow cover, but<br/>Smerdyakov was not reading it. He seemed to be sitting doing<br/>nothing. He met Ivan with a slow silent gaze, and was apparently<br/>not at all surprised at his coming. There was a great change in his<br/>face; he was much thinner and sallower. His eyes were sunken and<br/>there were blue marks under them.<br/><br/>"Why, you really are ill?" Ivan stopped short. "I won't keep you<br/>long, I wont even take off my coat. Where can one sit down?"<br/><br/>He went to the other end of the table, moved up a chair and sat<br/>down on it.<br/><br/>"Why do you look at me without speaking? We only come with one<br/>question, and I swear I won't go without an answer. Has the young<br/>lady, Katerina Ivanovna, been with you?"<br/><br/>Smerdyakov still remained silent, looking quietly at Ivan as<br/>before. Suddenly, with a motion of his hand, he turned his face<br/>away.<br/><br/>"What's the matter with you?" cried Ivan.<br/><br/>"Nothing."<br/><br/>"What do you mean by 'nothing'?"<br/><br/>"Yes, she has. It's no matter to you. Let me alone."<br/><br/>"No, I won't let you alone. Tell me, when was she here?"<br/><br/>
