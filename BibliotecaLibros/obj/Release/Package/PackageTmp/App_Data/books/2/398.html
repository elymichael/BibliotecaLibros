<br/>"Come now, is that so, Trifon Borissovitch?" replied Mitya.<br/>"Surely I didn't declare so positively that I'd brought three<br/>thousand?"<br/><br/>"You did say so, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. You said it before Andrey.<br/>Andrey himself is still here. Send for him. And in the hall, when<br/>you were treating the chorus, you shouted straight out that you<br/>would leave your sixth thousand here- that is, with what you spent<br/>before, we must understand. Stepan and Semyon heard it, and Pyotr<br/>Fomitch Kalganov, too, was standing beside you at the time. Maybe<br/>he'd remember itâ€¦ "<br/><br/>The evidence as to the "sixth" thousand made an extraordinary<br/>impression on the two lawyers. They were delighted with this new<br/>mode of reckoning; three and three made six, three thousand then<br/>and three now made six, that was clear.<br/><br/>They questioned all the peasants suggested by Trifon<br/>Borissovitch, Stepan and Semyon, the driver Andrey, and Kalganov.<br/>The peasants and the driver unhesitatingly confirmed Trifon<br/>Borissovitch's evidence. They noted down, with particular care,<br/>Andrey's account of the conversation he had had with Mitya on the<br/>road: "'Where,' says he, 'am I, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, going, to<br/>heaven or to hell, and shall I be forgiven in the next world or<br/>not?'" The psychological Ippolit Kirillovitch heard this with a<br/>subtle smile, and ended by recommending that these remarks as to<br/>where Dmitri Fyodorovitch would go should be "included in the<br/>case."<br/><br/>Kalganov, when called, came in reluctantly, frowning and<br/>ill-humoured, and he spoke to the lawyers as though he had never<br/>met them before in his life, though they were acquaintances whom he<br/>had been meeting every day for a long time past. He began by saying<br/>that "he knew nothing about it and didn't want to." But it appeared<br/>that he had heard of the" sixth" thousand, and he admitted that he<br/>had been standing close by at the moment. As far as he could see he<br/>"didn't know" how much money Mitya had in his hands. He affirmed<br/>that the Poles had cheated at cards. In reply to reiterated<br/>questions he stated that, after the Poles had been turned out,<br/>Mitya's position with Agrafena Alexandrovna had certainly improved,<br/>and that she had said that she loved him. He spoke of Agrafena<br/>Alexandrovna with reserve and respect, as though she had been a<br/>lady of the best society, and did not once allow himself to call<br/>her Grushenka. In spite of the young man's obvious repugnance at<br/>giving evidence, Ippolit Kirillovitch examined him at great length,<br/>and only from him learnt all the details of what made up Mitya's<br/>"romance," so to say, on that night. Mitya did not once pull<br/>Kalganov up. At last they let the young man go, and he left the<br/>room with unconcealed indignation.<br/><br/>The Poles, too, were examined. Though they had gone to bed in<br/>their room, they had not slept all night, and on the arrival of the<br/>police officers they hastily dressed and got ready, realising that<br/>they would certainly be sent for. They gave their evidence with<br/>dignity, though not without some uneasiness. The little Pole turned<br/>out to be a retired official of the twelfth class, who had served<br/>in Siberia as a veterinary surgeon. His name was Mussyalovitch. Pan<br/>Vrubelvsky turned out to be an uncertificated dentist. Although<br/>Nikolay Parfenovitch asked them questions on entering the room they<br/>both addressed their answers to Mihail Makarovitch, who was<br/>standing on one side, taking him in their ignorance for the most<br/>important person and in command, and addressed him at every word as<br/>"Pan Colonel." Only after several reproofs from Mihail Makarovitch<br/>himself, they grasped that they had to address their answers to<br/>Nikolay Parfenovitch only. It turned out that they could speak<br/>Russian quite correctly except for their accent in some words. Of<br/>his relations with Grushenka, past and present, Pan Mussyalovitch<br/>spoke proudly and warmly, so that Mitya was roused at once and<br/>declared that he would not allow the "scoundrel" to speak like that<br/>in his presence! Pan Mussyalovitch at once called attention to the<br/>word "scoundrel," and begged that it should be put down in the<br/>protocol. Mitya fumed with rage.<br/><br/>"He's a scoundrel! A scoundrel! You can put that down. And put<br/>down, too, that, in spite of the protocol I still declare that he's<br/>a scoundrel!" he cried.<br/><br/>Though Nikolay Parfenovitch did insert this in the protocol, he<br/>showed the most praiseworthy tact and management. After sternly<br/>reprimanding Mitya, he cut short all further inquiry into the<br/>romantic aspect of the case, and hastened to pass to what was<br/>essential. One piece of evidence given by the Poles roused special<br/>interest in the lawyers: that was how, in that very room, Mitya had<br/>tried to buy off Pan Mussyalovitch, and had offered him three<br/>thousand roubles to resign his claims, seven hundred roubles down,<br/>and the remaining two thousand three hundred "to be paid next day<br/>in the town." He had sworn at the time that he had not the whole<br/>sum with him at Mokroe, but that his money was in the town. Mitya<br/>observed hotly that he had not said that he would be sure to pay<br/>him the remainder next day in the town. But Pan Vrublevsky<br/>confirmed the statement, and Mitya, after thinking for a moment<br/>admitted, frowning, that it must have been as the Poles stated,<br/>that he had been excited at the time, and might indeed have said<br/>so.<br/><br/>The prosecutor positively pounced on this piece of evidence. It<br/>seemed to establish for the prosecution (and they did, in fact,<br/>base this deduction on it) that half, or a part of, the three<br/>thousand that had come into Mitya's hands might really have been<br/>left somewhere hidden in the town, or even, perhaps, somewhere<br/>here, in Mokroe. This would explain the circumstance, so baffling<br/>for the prosecution, that only eight hundred roubles were to be<br/>found in Mitya's hands. This circumstance had been the one piece of<br/>evidence which, insignificant as it was, had hitherto told, to some<br/>extent, in Mitya's favour. Now this one piece of evidence in his<br/>favour had broken down. In answer to the prosecutor's inquiry,<br/>where he would have got the remaining two thousand three hundred<br/>roubles, since he himself had denied having more than fifteen<br/>hundred, Mitya confidently replied that he had meant to offer the<br/>"little chap," not money, but a formal deed of conveyance of his<br/>rights to the village of Tchermashnya, those rights which he had<br/>already offered to Samsonov and Madame Hohlakov. The prosecutor<br/>positively smiled at the "innocence of this subterfuge."<br/><br/>"And you imagine he would have accepted such a deed as a<br/>substitute for two thousand three hundred roubles in cash?"<br/><br/>
