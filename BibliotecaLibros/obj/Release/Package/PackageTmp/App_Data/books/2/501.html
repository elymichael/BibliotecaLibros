<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>7<br/>The Second Visit to Smerdyakov<br/><br/><br/>BY that time Smerdyakov had been discharged from the hospital.<br/>Ivan knew his new lodging, the dilapidated little wooden house,<br/>divided in two by a passage, on one side of which lived Marya<br/>Kondratyevna and her mother, and on the other, Smerdyakov. No one<br/>knew on what terms he lived with them, whether as a friend or as a<br/>lodger. It was supposed afterwards that he had come to stay with<br/>them as Marya Kondratyevna's betrothed, and was living there for a<br/>time without paying for board or lodging. Both mother and daughter<br/>had the greatest respect for him and looked upon him as greatly<br/>superior to themselves.<br/><br/>Ivan knocked, and, on the door being opened, went straight into<br/>the passage. By Marya Kondratyevna's directions he went straight to<br/>the better room on the left, occupied by Smerdyakov. There was a<br/>tiled stove in the room and it was extremely hot. The walls were<br/>gay with blue paper, which was a good deal used however, and in the<br/>cracks under it cockroaches swarmed in amazing numbers, so that<br/>there was a continual rustling from them. The furniture was very<br/>scanty: two benches against each wall and two chairs by the table.<br/>The table of plain wood was covered with a cloth with pink patterns<br/>on it. There was a pot of geranium on each of the two little<br/>windows. In the corner there was a case of ikons. On the table<br/>stood a little copper samovar with many dents in it, and a tray<br/>with two cups. But Smerdyakov had finished tea and the samovar was<br/>out. He was sitting at the table on a bench. He was looking at an<br/>exercise-book and slowly writing with a pen. There was a bottle of<br/>ink by him and a flat iron candlestick, but with a composite<br/>candle. Ivan saw at once from Smerdyakov's face that he had<br/>completely recovered from his illness. His face was fresher,<br/>fuller, his hair stood up jauntily in front, and was plastered down<br/>at the sides. He was sitting in a parti-coloured, wadded<br/>dressing-gown, rather dirty and frayed, however. He had spectacles<br/>on his nose, which Ivan had never seen him wearing before. This<br/>trifling circumstance suddenly redoubled Ivan's anger: "A creature<br/>like that and wearing spectacles!"<br/><br/>Smerdyakov slowly raised his head and looked intently at his<br/>visitor through his spectacles; then he slowly took them off and<br/>rose from the bench, but by no means respectfully, almost lazily,<br/>doing the least possible required by common civility. All this<br/>struck Ivan instantly; he took it all in and noted it at once- most<br/>of all the look in Smerdyakov's eyes, positively malicious,<br/>churlish and haughty. "What do you want to intrude for?" it seemed<br/>to say; "we settled everything then; why have you come again?" Ivan<br/>could scarcely control himself.<br/><br/>"It's hot here," he said, still standing, and unbuttoned his<br/>overcoat.<br/><br/>"Take off your coat," Smerdyakov conceded.<br/><br/>Ivan took off his coat and threw it on a bench with trembling<br/>hands. He took a chair, moved it quickly to the table and sat down.<br/>Smerdyakov managed to sit down on his bench before him.<br/><br/>"To begin with, are we alone?" Ivan asked sternly and<br/>impulsively. "Can they overhear us in there?"<br/>
