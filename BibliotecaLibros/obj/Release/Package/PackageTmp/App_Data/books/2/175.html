<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>3<br/>The Brothers Make Friends<br/><br/><br/>IVAN was not, however, in a separate room, but only in a place<br/>shut off by a screen, so that it was unseen by other people in the<br/>room. It was the first room from the entrance with a buffet along<br/>the wall. Waiters were continually darting to and fro in it. The<br/>only customer in the room was an old retired military man drinking<br/>tea in a corner. But there was the usual bustle going on in the<br/>other rooms of the tavern; there were shouts for the waiters, the<br/>sound of popping corks, the click of billiard balls, the drone of<br/>the organ. Alyosha knew that Ivan did not usually visit this tavern<br/>and disliked taverns in general. So he must have come here, he<br/>reflected, simply to meet Dmitri by arrangement. Yet Dmitri was not<br/>there.<br/><br/>"Shall I order you fish, soup, or anything. You don't live on<br/>tea alone, I suppose," cried Ivan, apparently delighted at having<br/>got hold of Alyosha. He had finished dinner and was drinking<br/>tea.<br/><br/>"Let me have soup, and tea afterwards, I am hungry," said<br/>Alyosha gaily.<br/><br/>"And cherry jam? They have it here. You remember how you used to<br/>love cherry jam when you were little?"<br/><br/>"You remember that? Let me have jam too, I like it still."<br/><br/>Ivan rang for the waiter and ordered soup, jam, and tea.<br/><br/>"I remember everything, Alyosha, I remember you till you were<br/>eleven, I was nearly fifteen. There's such a difference between<br/>fifteen and eleven that brothers are never companions at those<br/>ages. I don't know whether I was fond of you even. When I went away<br/>to Moscow for the first few years I never thought of you at all.<br/>Then, when you came to Moscow yourself, we only met once somewhere,<br/>I believe. And now I've been here more than three months, and so<br/>far we have scarcely said a word to each other. To-morrow I am<br/>going away, and I was just thinking as I sat here how I could see<br/>you to say good-bye and just then you passed."<br/>
