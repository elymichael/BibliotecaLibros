<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>2<br/>Smerdyakov with a Guitar<br/><br/><br/>HE had no time to lose indeed. Even while he was saying good-bye<br/>to Lise, the thought had struck him that he must attempt some<br/>stratagem to find his brother Dmitri, who was evidently keeping out<br/>of his way. It was getting late, nearly three o'clock. Alyosha's<br/>whole soul turned to the monastery, to his dying saint, but the<br/>necessity of seeing Dmitri outweighed everything. The conviction<br/>that a great inevitable catastrophe was about to happen grew<br/>stronger in Alyosha's mind with every hour. What that catastrophe<br/>was, and what he would say at that moment to his brother, he could<br/>perhaps not have said definitely. "Even if my benefactor must die<br/>without me, anyway I won't have to reproach myself all my life with<br/>the thought that I might have saved something and did not, but<br/>passed by and hastened home. If I do as I intend, I shall be<br/>following his great precept."<br/><br/>His plan was to catch his brother Dmitri unawares, to climb over<br/>the fence, as he had the day before, get into the garden and sit in<br/>the summer-house. If Dmitri were not there, thought Alyosha, he<br/>would not announce himself to Foma or the women of the house, but<br/>would remain hidden in the summer-house, even if he had to wait<br/>there till evening. If, as before, Dmitri were lying in wait for<br/>Grushenka to come, he would be very likely to come to the<br/>summer-house. Alyosha did not, however, give much thought to the<br/>details of his plan, but resolved to act upon it, even if it meant<br/>not getting back to the monastery that day.<br/><br/>Everything happened without hindrance, he climbed over the<br/>hurdle almost in the same spot as the day before, and stole into<br/>the summer-house unseen. He did not want to be noticed. The woman<br/>of the house and Foma too, if he were here, might be loyal to his<br/>brother and obey his instructions, and so refuse to let Alyosha<br/>come into the garden, or might warn Dmitri that he was being sought<br/>and inquired for.<br/><br/>There was no one in the summer-house. Alyosha sat down and began<br/>to wait. He looked round the summer-house, which somehow struck him<br/>as a great deal more ancient than before. Though the day was just<br/>as fine as yesterday, it seemed a wretched little place this time.<br/>There was a circle on the table, left no doubt from the glass of<br/>brandy having been spilt the day before. Foolish and irrelevant<br/>ideas strayed about his mind, as they always do in a time of<br/>tedious waiting. He wondered, for instance, why he had sat down<br/>precisely in the same place as before, why not in the other seat.<br/>At last he felt very depressed- depressed by suspense and<br/>uncertainty. But he had not sat there more than a quarter of an<br/>hour, when he suddenly heard the thrum of a guitar somewhere quite<br/>close. People were sitting, or had only just sat down, somewhere in<br/>the bushes not more than twenty paces away. Alyosha suddenly<br/>recollected that on coming out of the summer-house the day before,<br/>he had caught a glimpse of an old green low garden-seat among the<br/>bushes on the left, by the fence. The people must be sitting on it<br/>now. Who were they?<br/><br/>A man's voice suddenly began singing in a sugary falsetto,<br/>accompanying himself on the guitar:<br/><br/>With invincible force<br/><br/>I am bound to my dear.<br/>
