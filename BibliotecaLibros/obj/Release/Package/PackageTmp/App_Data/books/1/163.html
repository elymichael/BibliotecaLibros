"Ah, and what did you gather from this allusion to a band—a<br/>speckled band?"<br/><br/>"Sometimes I have thought that it was merely the wild talk of<br/>delirium, sometimes that it may have referred to some band of<br/>people, perhaps to these very gipsies in the plantation. I do not<br/>know whether the spotted handkerchiefs which so many of them wear<br/>over their heads might have suggested the strange adjective which<br/>she used."<br/><br/>Holmes shook his head like a man who is far from being<br/>satisfied.<br/><br/>"These are very deep waters," said he; "pray go on with your<br/>narrative."<br/><br/>"Two years have passed since then, and my life has been until<br/>lately lonelier than ever. A month ago, however, a dear friend,<br/>whom I have known for many years, has done me the honour to ask my<br/>hand in marriage. His name is Armitage—Percy Armitage—the second<br/>son of Mr. Armitage, of Crane Water, near Reading. My stepfather<br/>has offered no opposition to the match, and we are to be married in<br/>the course of the spring. Two days ago some repairs were started in<br/>the west wing of the building, and my bedroom wall has been<br/>pierced, so that I have had to move into the chamber in which my<br/>sister died, and to sleep in the very bed in which she slept.<br/>Imagine, then, my thrill of terror when last night, as I lay awake,<br/>thinking over her terrible fate, I suddenly heard in the silence of<br/>the night the low whistle which had been the herald of her own<br/>death. I sprang up and lit the lamp, but nothing was to be seen in<br/>the room. I was too shaken to go to bed again, however, so I<br/>dressed, and as soon as it was daylight I slipped down, got a<br/>dog-cart at the Crown Inn, which is opposite, and drove to<br/>Leatherhead, from whence I have come on this morning with the one<br/>object of seeing you and asking your advice."<br/><br/>"You have done wisely," said my friend. "But have you told me<br/>all?"<br/><br/>"Yes, all."<br/><br/>"Miss Roylott, you have not. You are screening your<br/>stepfather."<br/><br/>"Why, what do you mean?"<br/><br/>For answer Holmes pushed back the frill of black lace which<br/>fringed the hand that lay upon our visitor's knee. Five little<br/>livid spots, the marks of four fingers and a thumb, were printed<br/>upon the white wrist.<br/><br/>"You have been cruelly used," said Holmes.<br/>
