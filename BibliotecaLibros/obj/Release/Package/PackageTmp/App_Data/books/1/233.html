<br/>"Do you not think, then, that he might have been trying to<br/>straighten it?"<br/><br/>"God bless you! You are doing what you can for him and for me.<br/>But it is too heavy a task. What was he doing there at all? If his<br/>purpose were innocent, why did he not say so?"<br/><br/>"Precisely. And if it were guilty, why did he not invent a lie?<br/>His silence appears to me to cut both ways. There are several<br/>singular points about the case. What did the police think of the<br/>noise which awoke you from your sleep?"<br/><br/>"They considered that it might be caused by Arthur's closing his<br/>bedroom door."<br/><br/>"A likely story! As if a man bent on felony would slam his door<br/>so as to wake a household. What did they say, then, of the<br/>disappearance of these gems?"<br/><br/>"They are still sounding the planking and probing the furniture<br/>in the hope of finding them."<br/><br/>"Have they thought of looking outside the house?"<br/><br/>"Yes, they have shown extraordinary energy. The whole garden has<br/>already been minutely examined."<br/><br/>"Now, my dear sir," said Holmes. "is it not obvious to you now<br/>that this matter really strikes very much deeper than either you or<br/>the police were at first inclined to think? It appeared to you to<br/>be a simple case; to me it seems exceedingly complex. Consider what<br/>is involved by your theory. You suppose that your son came down<br/>from his bed, went, at great risk, to your dressing-room, opened<br/>your bureau, took out your coronet, broke off by main force a small<br/>portion of it, went off to some other place, concealed three gems<br/>out of the thirty-nine, with such skill that nobody can find them,<br/>and then returned with the other thirty-six into the room in which<br/>he exposed himself to the greatest danger of being discovered. I<br/>ask you now, is such a theory tenable?"<br/><br/>"But what other is there?" cried the banker with a gesture of<br/>despair. "If his motives were innocent, why does he not explain<br/>them?"<br/><br/>
