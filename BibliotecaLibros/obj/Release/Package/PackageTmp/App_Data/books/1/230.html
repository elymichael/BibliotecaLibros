"I am endeavouring to tell you everything, Mr. Holmes, which may<br/>have any bearing upon the case, but I beg that you will question me<br/>upon any point which I do not make clear."<br/><br/>"On the contrary, your statement is singularly lucid."<br/><br/>"I come to a part of my story now in which I should wish to be<br/>particularly so. I am not a very heavy sleeper, and the anxiety in<br/>my mind tended, no doubt, to make me even less so than usual. About<br/>two in the morning, then, I was awakened by some sound in the<br/>house. It had ceased ere I was wide awake, but it had left an<br/>impression behind it as though a window had gently closed<br/>somewhere. I lay listening with all my ears. Suddenly, to my<br/>horror, there was a distinct sound of footsteps moving softly in<br/>the next room. I slipped out of bed, all palpitating with fear, and<br/>peeped round the corner of my dressing-room door.<br/><br/>"'Arthur!' I screamed, 'you villain! you thief! How dare you<br/>touch that coronet?'<br/><br/>"The gas was half up, as I had left it, and my unhappy boy,<br/>dressed only in his shirt and trousers, was standing beside the<br/>light, holding the coronet in his hands. He appeared to be<br/>wrenching at it, or bending it with all his strength. At my cry he<br/>dropped it from his grasp and turned as pale as death. I snatched<br/>it up and examined it. One of the gold corners, with three of the<br/>beryls in it, was missing.<br/><br/>"'You blackguard!' I shouted, beside myself with rage. 'You have<br/>destroyed it! You have dishonoured me forever! Where are the jewels<br/>which you have stolen?'<br/><br/>"'Stolen!' he cried.<br/><br/>"'Yes, thief!' I roared, shaking him by the shoulder.<br/><br/>"'There are none missing. There cannot be any missing,' said<br/>he.<br/><br/>"'There are three missing. And you know where they are. Must I<br/>call you a liar as well as a thief? Did I not see you trying to<br/>tear off another piece?'<br/><br/>"'You have called me names enough,' said he, 'I will not stand<br/>it any longer. I shall not say another word about this business,<br/>since you have chosen to insult me. I will leave your house in the<br/>morning and make my own way in the world.'<br/>
