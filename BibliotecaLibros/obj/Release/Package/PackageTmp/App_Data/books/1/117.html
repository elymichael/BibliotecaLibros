<br/>"You have a grand gift of silence, Watson," said he. "It makes<br/>you quite invaluable as a companion. 'Pon my word, it is a great<br/>thing for me to have someone to talk to, for my own thoughts are<br/>not over-pleasant. I was wondering what I should say to this dear<br/>little woman to-night when she meets me at the door."<br/><br/>"You forget that I know nothing about it."<br/><br/>"I shall just have time to tell you the facts of the case before<br/>we get to Lee. It seems absurdly simple, and yet, somehow I can get<br/>nothing to go upon. There's plenty of thread, no doubt, but I can't<br/>get the end of it into my hand. Now, I'll state the case clearly<br/>and concisely to you, Watson, and maybe you can see a spark where<br/>all is dark to me."<br/><br/>"Proceed, then."<br/><br/>"Some years ago—to be definite, in May, 1884—there came to Lee a<br/>gentleman, Neville St. Clair by name, who appeared to have plenty<br/>of money. He took a large villa, laid out the grounds very nicely,<br/>and lived generally in good style. By degrees he made friends in<br/>the neighbourhood, and in 1887 he married the daughter of a local<br/>brewer, by whom he now has two children. He had no occupation, but<br/>was interested in several companies and went into town as a rule in<br/>the morning, returning by the 5:14 from Cannon Street every night.<br/>Mr. St. Clair is now thirty-seven years of age, is a man of<br/>temperate habits, a good husband, a very affectionate father, and a<br/>man who is popular with all who know him. I may add that his whole<br/>debts at the present moment, as far as we have been able to<br/>ascertain, amount to 88 pounds 10s., while he has 220 pounds<br/>standing to his credit in the Capital and Counties Bank. There is<br/>no reason, therefore, to think that money troubles have been<br/>weighing upon his mind.<br/><br/>"Last Monday Mr. Neville St. Clair went into town rather earlier<br/>than usual, remarking before he started that he had two important<br/>commissions to perform, and that he would bring his little boy home<br/>a box of bricks. Now, by the merest chance, his wife received a<br/>telegram upon this same Monday, very shortly after his departure,<br/>to the effect that a small parcel of considerable value which she<br/>had been expecting was waiting for her at the offices of the<br/>Aberdeen Shipping Company. Now, if you are well up in your London,<br/>you will know that the office of the company is in Fresno Street,<br/>which branches out of Upper Swandam Lane, where you found me<br/>to-night. Mrs. St. Clair had her lunch, started for the City, did<br/>some shopping, proceeded to the company's office, got her packet,<br/>and found herself at exactly 4:35 walking through Swandam Lane on<br/>her way back to the station. Have you followed me so far?"<br/><br/>"It is very clear."<br/><br/>"If you remember, Monday was an exceedingly hot day, and Mrs.<br/>St. Clair walked slowly, glancing about in the hope of seeing a<br/>cab, as she did not like the neighbourhood in which she found<br/>herself. While she was walking in this way down Swandam Lane, she<br/>suddenly heard an ejaculation or cry, and was struck cold to see<br/>her husband looking down at her and, as it seemed to her, beckoning<br/>to her from a second-floor window. The window was open, and she<br/>distinctly saw his face, which she describes as being terribly<br/>agitated. He waved his hands frantically to her, and then vanished<br/>from the window so suddenly that it seemed to her that he had been<br/>plucked back by some irresistible force from behind. One singular<br/>point which struck her quick feminine eye was that although he wore<br/>some dark coat, such as he had started to town in, he had on<br/>neither collar nor necktie.<br/><br/>"Convinced that something was amiss with him, she rushed down<br/>the steps—for the house was none other than the opium den in which<br/>you found me to-night—and running through the front room she<br/>attempted to ascend the stairs which led to the first floor. At the<br/>foot of the stairs, however, she met this Lascar scoundrel of whom<br/>I have spoken, who thrust her back and, aided by a Dane, who acts<br/>as assistant there, pushed her out into the street. Filled with the<br/>most maddening doubts and fears, she rushed down the lane and, by<br/>rare good-fortune, met in Fresno Street a number of constables with<br/>an inspector, all on their way to their beat. The inspector and two<br/>men accompanied her back, and in spite of the continued resistance<br/>of the proprietor, they made their way to the room in which Mr. St.<br/>Clair had last been seen. There was no sign of him there. In fact,<br/>in the whole of that floor there was no one to be found save a<br/>crippled wretch of hideous aspect, who, it seems, made his home<br/>there. Both he and the Lascar stoutly swore that no one else had<br/>been in the front room during the afternoon. So determined was<br/>their denial that the inspector was staggered, and had almost come<br/>to believe that Mrs. St. Clair had been deluded when, with a cry,<br/>she sprang at a small deal box which lay upon the table and tore<br/>the lid from it. Out there fell a cascade of children's bricks. It<br/>was the toy which he had promised to bring home.<br/><br/>"This discovery, and the evident confusion which the cripple<br/>showed, made the inspector realise that the matter was serious. The<br/>rooms were carefully examined, and results all pointed to an<br/>abominable crime. The front room was plainly furnished as a<br/>sitting-room and led into a small bedroom, which looked out upon<br/>the back of one of the wharves. Between the wharf and the bedroom<br/>window is a narrow strip, which is dry at low tide but is covered<br/>at high tide with at least four and a half feet of water. The<br/>bedroom window was a broad one and opened from below. On<br/>examination traces of blood were to be seen upon the windowsill,<br/>and several scattered drops were visible upon the wooden floor of<br/>the bedroom. Thrust away behind a curtain in the front room were<br/>all the clothes of Mr. Neville St. Clair, with the exception of his<br/>coat. His boots, his socks, his hat, and his watch—all were there.<br/>There were no signs of violence upon any of these garments, and<br/>there were no other traces of Mr. Neville St. Clair. Out of the<br/>window he must apparently have gone for no other exit could be<br/>discovered, and the ominous bloodstains upon the sill gave little<br/>promise that he could save himself by swimming, for the tide was at<br/>its very highest at the moment of the tragedy.<br/><br/>
