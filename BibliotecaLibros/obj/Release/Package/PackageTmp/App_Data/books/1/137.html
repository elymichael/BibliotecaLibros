"Precisely."<br/><br/>"But you are joking. What can you gather from this old battered<br/>felt?"<br/><br/>"Here is my lens. You know my methods. What can you gather<br/>yourself as to the individuality of the man who has worn this<br/>article?"<br/><br/>I took the tattered object in my hands and turned it over rather<br/>ruefully. It was a very ordinary black hat of the usual round<br/>shape, hard and much the worse for wear. The lining had been of red<br/>silk, but was a good deal discoloured. There was no maker's name;<br/>but, as Holmes had remarked, the initials "H. B." were scrawled<br/>upon one side. It was pierced in the brim for a hat-securer, but<br/>the elastic was missing. For the rest, it was cracked, exceedingly<br/>dusty, and spotted in several places, although there seemed to have<br/>been some attempt to hide the discoloured patches by smearing them<br/>with ink.<br/><br/>"I can see nothing," said I, handing it back to my friend.<br/><br/>"On the contrary, Watson, you can see everything. You fail,<br/>however, to reason from what you see. You are too timid in drawing<br/>your inferences."<br/><br/>"Then, pray tell me what it is that you can infer from this<br/>hat?"<br/><br/>He picked it up and gazed at it in the peculiar introspective<br/>fashion which was characteristic of him. "It is perhaps less<br/>suggestive than it might have been," he remarked, "and yet there<br/>are a few inferences which are very distinct, and a few others<br/>which represent at least a strong balance of probability. That the<br/>man was highly intellectual is of course obvious upon the face of<br/>it, and also that he was fairly well-to-do within the last three<br/>years, although he has now fallen upon evil days. He had foresight,<br/>but has less now than formerly, pointing to a moral retrogression,<br/>which, when taken with the decline of his fortunes, seems to<br/>indicate some evil influence, probably drink, at work upon him.<br/>This may account also for the obvious fact that his wife has ceased<br/>to love him."<br/><br/>"My dear Holmes!"<br/><br/>"He has, however, retained some degree of self-respect," he<br/>continued, disregarding my remonstrance. "He is a man who leads a<br/>sedentary life, goes out little, is out of training entirely, is<br/>middle-aged, has grizzled hair which he has had cut within the last<br/>few days, and which he anoints with lime-cream. These are the more<br/>patent facts which are to be deduced from his hat. Also, by the<br/>way, that it is extremely improbable that he has gas laid on in his<br/>house."<br/><br/>"You are certainly joking, Holmes."<br/>
