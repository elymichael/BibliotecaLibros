<br/>Holmes grinned at the last item. "Well," he said, "I say now, as<br/>I said then, that a man should keep his little brain-attic stocked<br/>with all the furniture that he is likely to use, and the rest he<br/>can put away in the lumber-room of his library, where he can get it<br/>if he wants it. Now, for such a case as the one which has been<br/>submitted to us to-night, we need certainly to muster all our<br/>resources. Kindly hand me down the letter K of the 'American<br/>Encyclopaedia' which stands upon the shelf beside you. Thank you.<br/>Now let us consider the situation and see what may be deduced from<br/>it. In the first place, we may start with a strong presumption that<br/>Colonel Openshaw had some very strong reason for leaving America.<br/>Men at his time of life do not change all their habits and exchange<br/>willingly the charming climate of Florida for the lonely life of an<br/>English provincial town. His extreme love of solitude in England<br/>suggests the idea that he was in fear of someone or something, so<br/>we may assume as a working hypothesis that it was fear of someone<br/>or something which drove him from America. As to what it was he<br/>feared, we can only deduce that by considering the formidable<br/>letters which were received by himself and his successors. Did you<br/>remark the postmarks of those letters?"<br/><br/>"The first was from Pondicherry, the second from Dundee, and the<br/>third from London."<br/><br/>"From East London. What do you deduce from that?"<br/><br/>"They are all seaports. That the writer was on board of a<br/>ship."<br/><br/>"Excellent. We have already a clue. There can be no doubt that<br/>the probability—the strong probability—is that the writer was on<br/>board of a ship. And now let us consider another point. In the case<br/>of Pondicherry, seven weeks elapsed between the threat and its<br/>fulfilment, in Dundee it was only some three or four days. Does<br/>that suggest anything?"<br/><br/>"A greater distance to travel."<br/><br/>"But the letter had also a greater distance to come."<br/><br/>"Then I do not see the point."<br/><br/>"There is at least a presumption that the vessel in which the<br/>man or men are is a sailing-ship. It looks as if they always send<br/>their singular warning or token before them when starting upon<br/>their mission. You see how quickly the deed followed the sign when<br/>it came from Dundee. If they had come from Pondicherry in a steamer<br/>they would have arrived almost as soon as their letter. But, as a<br/>matter of fact, seven weeks elapsed. I think that those seven weeks<br/>represented the difference between the mail-boat which brought the<br/>letter and the sailing vessel which brought the writer."<br/><br/>"It is possible."<br/><br/>
