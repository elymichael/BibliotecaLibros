"Lady St. Simon said something about 'jumping a claim.' She was<br/>accustomed to use slang of the kind. I have no idea what she<br/>meant."<br/><br/>"American slang is very expressive sometimes. And what did your<br/>wife do when she finished speaking to her maid?"<br/><br/>"She walked into the breakfast-room."<br/><br/>"On your arm?"<br/><br/>"No, alone. She was very independent in little matters like<br/>that. Then, after we had sat down for ten minutes or so, she rose<br/>hurriedly, muttered some words of apology, and left the room. She<br/>never came back."<br/><br/>"But this maid, Alice, as I understand, deposes that she went to<br/>her room, covered her bride's dress with a long ulster, put on a<br/>bonnet, and went out."<br/><br/>"Quite so. And she was afterwards seen walking into Hyde Park in<br/>company with Flora Millar, a woman who is now in custody, and who<br/>had already made a disturbance at Mr. Doran's house that<br/>morning."<br/><br/>"Ah, yes. I should like a few particulars as to this young lady,<br/>and your relations to her."<br/><br/>Lord St. Simon shrugged his shoulders and raised his eyebrows.<br/>"We have been on a friendly footing for some yearsâ€”I may say on a<br/>very friendly footing. She used to be at the Allegro. I have not<br/>treated her ungenerously, and she had no just cause of complaint<br/>against me, but you know what women are, Mr. Holmes. Flora was a<br/>dear little thing, but exceedingly hot-headed and devotedly<br/>attached to me. She wrote me dreadful letters when she heard that I<br/>was about to be married, and, to tell the truth, the reason why I<br/>had the marriage celebrated so quietly was that I feared lest there<br/>might be a scandal in the church. She came to Mr. Doran's door just<br/>after we returned, and she endeavoured to push her way in, uttering<br/>very abusive expressions towards my wife, and even threatening her,<br/>but I had foreseen the possibility of something of the sort, and I<br/>had two police fellows there in private clothes, who soon pushed<br/>her out again. She was quiet when she saw that there was no good in<br/>making a row."<br/><br/>"Did your wife hear all this?"<br/><br/>"No, thank goodness, she did not."<br/>
