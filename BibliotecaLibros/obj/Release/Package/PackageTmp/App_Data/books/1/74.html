<br/>"On the contrary," said Holmes, "it is the brightest rift which<br/>I can at present see in the clouds. However innocent he might be,<br/>he could not be such an absolute imbecile as not to see that the<br/>circumstances were very black against him. Had he appeared<br/>surprised at his own arrest, or feigned indignation at it, I should<br/>have looked upon it as highly suspicious, because such surprise or<br/>anger would not be natural under the circumstances, and yet might<br/>appear to be the best policy to a scheming man. His frank<br/>acceptance of the situation marks him as either an innocent man, or<br/>else as a man of considerable self-restraint and firmness. As to<br/>his remark about his deserts, it was also not unnatural if you<br/>consider that he stood beside the dead body of his father, and that<br/>there is no doubt that he had that very day so far forgotten his<br/>filial duty as to bandy words with him, and even, according to the<br/>little girl whose evidence is so important, to raise his hand as if<br/>to strike him. The self-reproach and contrition which are displayed<br/>in his remark appear to me to be the signs of a healthy mind rather<br/>than of a guilty one."<br/><br/>I shook my head. "Many men have been hanged on far slighter<br/>evidence," I remarked.<br/><br/>"So they have. And many men have been wrongfully hanged."<br/><br/>"What is the young man's own account of the matter?"<br/><br/>"It is, I am afraid, not very encouraging to his supporters,<br/>though there are one or two points in it which are suggestive. You<br/>will find it here, and may read it for yourself."<br/><br/>He picked out from his bundle a copy of the local Herefordshire<br/>paper, and having turned down the sheet he pointed out the<br/>paragraph in which the unfortunate young man had given his own<br/>statement of what had occurred. I settled myself down in the corner<br/>of the carriage and read it very carefully. It ran in this way:<br/><br/>"Mr. James McCarthy, the only son of the deceased, was then<br/>called and gave evidence as follows: 'I had been away from home for<br/>three days at Bristol, and had only just returned upon the morning<br/>of last Monday, the 3rd. My father was absent from home at the time<br/>of my arrival, and I was informed by the maid that he had driven<br/>over to Ross with John Cobb, the groom. Shortly after my return I<br/>heard the wheels of his trap in the yard, and, looking out of my<br/>window, I saw him get out and walk rapidly out of the yard, though<br/>I was not aware in which direction he was going. I then took my gun<br/>and strolled out in the direction of the Boscombe Pool, with the<br/>intention of visiting the rabbit warren which is upon the other<br/>side. On my way I saw William Crowder, the game-keeper, as he had<br/>stated in his evidence; but he is mistaken in thinking that I was<br/>following my father. I had no idea that he was in front of me. When<br/>about a hundred yards from the pool I heard a cry of "Cooee!" which<br/>was a usual signal between my father and myself. I then hurried<br/>forward, and found him standing by the pool. He appeared to be much<br/>surprised at seeing me and asked me rather roughly what I was doing<br/>there. A conversation ensued which led to high words and almost to<br/>blows, for my father was a man of a very violent temper. Seeing<br/>that his passion was becoming ungovernable, I left him and returned<br/>towards Hatherley Farm. I had not gone more than 150 yards,<br/>however, when I heard a hideous outcry behind me, which caused me<br/>to run back again. I found my father expiring upon the ground, with<br/>his head terribly injured. I dropped my gun and held him in my<br/>arms, but he almost instantly expired. I knelt beside him for some<br/>minutes, and then made my way to Mr. Turner's lodge-keeper, his<br/>house being the nearest, to ask for assistance. I saw no one near<br/>my father when I returned, and I have no idea how he came by his<br/>injuries. He was not a popular man, being somewhat cold and<br/>forbidding in his manners, but he had, as far as I know, no active<br/>enemies. I know nothing further of the matter.'<br/><br/>"The Coroner: Did your father make any statement to you before<br/>he died?<br/><br/>"Witness: He mumbled a few words, but I could only catch some<br/>allusion to a rat.<br/><br/>"The Coroner: What did you understand by that?<br/><br/>
