<br/>"'The propriety of my leaving it. You may set your mind at rest<br/>about that. I should not dream of doing so were it not absolutely<br/>certain that I should be able in four days to reclaim it. It is a<br/>pure matter of form. Is the security sufficient?'<br/><br/>"'Ample.'<br/><br/>"'You understand, Mr. Holder, that I am giving you a strong<br/>proof of the confidence which I have in you, founded upon all that<br/>I have heard of you. I rely upon you not only to be discreet and to<br/>refrain from all gossip upon the matter but, above all, to preserve<br/>this coronet with every possible precaution because I need not say<br/>that a great public scandal would be caused if any harm were to<br/>befall it. Any injury to it would be almost as serious as its<br/>complete loss, for there are no beryls in the world to match these,<br/>and it would be impossible to replace them. I leave it with you,<br/>however, with every confidence, and I shall call for it in person<br/>on Monday morning.'<br/><br/>"Seeing that my client was anxious to leave, I said no more but,<br/>calling for my cashier, I ordered him to pay over fifty 1000 pound<br/>notes. When I was alone once more, however, with the precious case<br/>lying upon the table in front of me, I could not but think with<br/>some misgivings of the immense responsibility which it entailed<br/>upon me. There could be no doubt that, as it was a national<br/>possession, a horrible scandal would ensue if any misfortune should<br/>occur to it. I already regretted having ever consented to take<br/>charge of it. However, it was too late to alter the matter now, so<br/>I locked it up in my private safe and turned once more to my<br/>work.<br/><br/>"When evening came I felt that it would be an imprudence to<br/>leave so precious a thing in the office behind me. Bankers' safes<br/>had been forced before now, and why should not mine be? If so, how<br/>terrible would be the position in which I should find myself! I<br/>determined, therefore, that for the next few days I would always<br/>carry the case backward and forward with me, so that it might never<br/>be really out of my reach. With this intention, I called a cab and<br/>drove out to my house at Streatham, carrying the jewel with me. I<br/>did not breathe freely until I had taken it upstairs and locked it<br/>in the bureau of my dressing-room.<br/><br/>"And now a word as to my household, Mr. Holmes, for I wish you<br/>to thoroughly understand the situation. My groom and my page sleep<br/>out of the house, and may be set aside altogether. I have three<br/>maid-servants who have been with me a number of years and whose<br/>absolute reliability is quite above suspicion. Another, Lucy Parr,<br/>the second waiting-maid, has only been in my service a few months.<br/>She came with an excellent character, however, and has always given<br/>me satisfaction. She is a very pretty girl and has attracted<br/>admirers who have occasionally hung about the place. That is the<br/>only drawback which we have found to her, but we believe her to be<br/>a thoroughly good girl in every way.<br/><br/>"So much for the servants. My family itself is so small that it<br/>will not take me long to describe it. I am a widower and have an<br/>only son, Arthur. He has been a disappointment to me, Mr. Holmes—a<br/>grievous disappointment. I have no doubt that I am myself to blame.<br/>People tell me that I have spoiled him. Very likely I have. When my<br/>dear wife died I felt that he was all I had to love. I could not<br/>bear to see the smile fade even for a moment from his face. I have<br/>never denied him a wish. Perhaps it would have been better for both<br/>of us had I been sterner, but I meant it for the best.<br/><br/>"It was naturally my intention that he should succeed me in my<br/>business, but he was not of a business turn. He was wild, wayward,<br/>and, to speak the truth, I could not trust him in the handling of<br/>large sums of money. When he was young he became a member of an<br/>aristocratic club, and there, having charming manners, he was soon<br/>the intimate of a number of men with long purses and expensive<br/>habits. He learned to play heavily at cards and to squander money<br/>on the turf, until he had again and again to come to me and implore<br/>me to give him an advance upon his allowance, that he might settle<br/>his debts of honour. He tried more than once to break away from the<br/>dangerous company which he was keeping, but each time the influence<br/>of his friend, Sir George Burnwell, was enough to draw him back<br/>again.<br/><br/>"And, indeed, I could not wonder that such a man as Sir George<br/>Burnwell should gain an influence over him, for he has frequently<br/>brought him to my house, and I have found myself that I could<br/>hardly resist the fascination of his manner. He is older than<br/>Arthur, a man of the world to his finger-tips, one who had been<br/>everywhere, seen everything, a brilliant talker, and a man of great<br/>personal beauty. Yet when I think of him in cold blood, far away<br/>from the glamour of his presence, I am convinced from his cynical<br/>speech and the look which I have caught in his eyes that he is one<br/>who should be deeply distrusted. So I think, and so, too, thinks my<br/>little Mary, who has a woman's quick insight into character.<br/><br/>"And now there is only she to be described. She is my niece; but<br/>when my brother died five years ago and left her alone in the world<br/>I adopted her, and have looked upon her ever since as my daughter.<br/>She is a sunbeam in my house—sweet, loving, beautiful, a wonderful<br/>manager and housekeeper, yet as tender and quiet and gentle as a<br/>woman could be. She is my right hand. I do not know what I could do<br/>without her. In only one matter has she ever gone against my<br/>wishes. Twice my boy has asked her to marry him, for he loves her<br/>devotedly, but each time she has refused him. I think that if<br/>anyone could have drawn him into the right path it would have been<br/>she, and that his marriage might have changed his whole life; but<br/>now, alas! it is too late—forever too late!<br/><br/>
