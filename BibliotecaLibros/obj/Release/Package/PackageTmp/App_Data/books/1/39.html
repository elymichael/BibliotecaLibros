<br/>"'Well,' said he, showing me the advertisement, 'you can see for<br/>yourself that the League has a vacancy, and there is the address<br/>where you should apply for particulars. As far as I can make out,<br/>the League was founded by an American millionaire, Ezekiah Hopkins,<br/>who was very peculiar in his ways. He was himself red-headed, and<br/>he had a great sympathy for all red-headed men; so when he died it<br/>was found that he had left his enormous fortune in the hands of<br/>trustees, with instructions to apply the interest to the providing<br/>of easy berths to men whose hair is of that colour. From all I hear<br/>it is splendid pay and very little to do.'<br/><br/>"'But,' said I, 'there would be millions of red-headed men who<br/>would apply.'<br/><br/>"'Not so many as you might think,' he answered. 'You see it is<br/>really confined to Londoners, and to grown men. This American had<br/>started from London when he was young, and he wanted to do the old<br/>town a good turn. Then, again, I have heard it is no use your<br/>applying if your hair is light red, or dark red, or anything but<br/>real bright, blazing, fiery red. Now, if you cared to apply, Mr.<br/>Wilson, you would just walk in; but perhaps it would hardly be<br/>worth your while to put yourself out of the way for the sake of a<br/>few hundred pounds.'<br/><br/>"Now, it is a fact, gentlemen, as you may see for yourselves,<br/>that my hair is of a very full and rich tint, so that it seemed to<br/>me that if there was to be any competition in the matter I stood as<br/>good a chance as any man that I had ever met. Vincent Spaulding<br/>seemed to know so much about it that I thought he might prove<br/>useful, so I just ordered him to put up the shutters for the day<br/>and to come right away with me. He was very willing to have a<br/>holiday, so we shut the business up and started off for the address<br/>that was given us in the advertisement.<br/><br/>"I never hope to see such a sight as that again, Mr. Holmes.<br/>From north, south, east, and west every man who had a shade of red<br/>in his hair had tramped into the city to answer the advertisement.<br/>Fleet Street was choked with red-headed folk, and Pope's Court<br/>looked like a coster's orange barrow. I should not have thought<br/>there were so many in the whole country as were brought together by<br/>that single advertisement. Every shade of colour they wereâ€”straw,<br/>lemon, orange, brick, Irish-setter, liver, clay; but, as Spaulding<br/>said, there were not many who had the real vivid flame-coloured<br/>tint. When I saw how many were waiting, I would have given it up in<br/>despair; but Spaulding would not hear of it. How he did it I could<br/>not imagine, but he pushed and pulled and butted until he got me<br/>through the crowd, and right up to the steps which led to the<br/>office. There was a double stream upon the stair, some going up in<br/>hope, and some coming back dejected; but we wedged in as well as we<br/>could and soon found ourselves in the office."<br/><br/>"Your experience has been a most entertaining one," remarked<br/>Holmes as his client paused and refreshed his memory with a huge<br/>pinch of snuff. "Pray continue your very interesting<br/>statement."<br/><br/>"There was nothing in the office but a couple of wooden chairs<br/>and a deal table, behind which sat a small man with a head that was<br/>even redder than mine. He said a few words to each candidate as he<br/>came up, and then he always managed to find some fault in them<br/>which would disqualify them. Getting a vacancy did not seem to be<br/>such a very easy matter, after all. However, when our turn came the<br/>little man was much more favourable to me than to any of the<br/>others, and he closed the door as we entered, so that he might have<br/>a private word with us.<br/><br/>"'This is Mr. Jabez Wilson,' said my assistant, 'and he is<br/>willing to fill a vacancy in the League.'<br/><br/>"'And he is admirably suited for it,' the other answered. 'He<br/>has every requirement. I cannot recall when I have seen anything so<br/>fine.' He took a step backward, cocked his head on one side, and<br/>gazed at my hair until I felt quite bashful. Then suddenly he<br/>plunged forward, wrung my hand, and congratulated me warmly on my<br/>success.<br/><br/>"'It would be injustice to hesitate,' said he. 'You will,<br/>however, I am sure, excuse me for taking an obvious precaution.'<br/>With that he seized my hair in both his hands, and tugged until I<br/>yelled with the pain. 'There is water in your eyes,' said he as he<br/>released me. 'I perceive that all is as it should be. But we have<br/>to be careful, for we have twice been deceived by wigs and once by<br/>paint. I could tell you tales of cobbler's wax which would disgust<br/>you with human nature.' He stepped over to the window and shouted<br/>through it at the top of his voice that the vacancy was filled. A<br/>groan of disappointment came up from below, and the folk all<br/>trooped away in different directions until there was not a red-head<br/>to be seen except my own and that of the manager.<br/><br/>
