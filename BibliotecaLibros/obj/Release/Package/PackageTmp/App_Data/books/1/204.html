<br/>"Indeed. This is more interesting than it promised to be; quite<br/>dramatic, in fact."<br/><br/>"Yes; it struck me as being a little out of the common."<br/><br/>"They often vanish before the ceremony, and occasionally during<br/>the honeymoon; but I cannot call to mind anything quite so prompt<br/>as this. Pray let me have the details."<br/><br/>"I warn you that they are very incomplete."<br/><br/>"Perhaps we may make them less so."<br/><br/>"Such as they are, they are set forth in a single article of a<br/>morning paper of yesterday, which I will read to you. It is headed,<br/>'Singular Occurrence at a Fashionable Wedding':<br/><br/>"'The family of Lord Robert St. Simon has been thrown into the<br/>greatest consternation by the strange and painful episodes which<br/>have taken place in connection with his wedding. The ceremony, as<br/>shortly announced in the papers of yesterday, occurred on the<br/>previous morning; but it is only now that it has been possible to<br/>confirm the strange rumours which have been so persistently<br/>floating about. In spite of the attempts of the friends to hush the<br/>matter up, so much public attention has now been drawn to it that<br/>no good purpose can be served by affecting to disregard what is a<br/>common subject for conversation.<br/><br/>"'The ceremony, which was performed at St. George's, Hanover<br/>Square, was a very quiet one, no one being present save the father<br/>of the bride, Mr. Aloysius Doran, the Duchess of Balmoral, Lord<br/>Backwater, Lord Eustace and Lady Clara St. Simon (the younger<br/>brother and sister of the bridegroom), and Lady Alicia Whittington.<br/>The whole party proceeded afterwards to the house of Mr. Aloysius<br/>Doran, at Lancaster Gate, where breakfast had been prepared. It<br/>appears that some little trouble was caused by a woman, whose name<br/>has not been ascertained, who endeavoured to force her way into the<br/>house after the bridal party, alleging that she had some claim upon<br/>Lord St. Simon. It was only after a painful and prolonged scene<br/>that she was ejected by the butler and the footman. The bride, who<br/>had fortunately entered the house before this unpleasant<br/>interruption, had sat down to breakfast with the rest, when she<br/>complained of a sudden indisposition and retired to her room. Her<br/>prolonged absence having caused some comment, her father followed<br/>her, but learned from her maid that she had only come up to her<br/>chamber for an instant, caught up an ulster and bonnet, and hurried<br/>down to the passage. One of the footmen declared that he had seen a<br/>lady leave the house thus apparelled, but had refused to credit<br/>that it was his mistress, believing her to be with the company. On<br/>ascertaining that his daughter had disappeared, Mr. Aloysius Doran,<br/>in conjunction with the bridegroom, instantly put themselves in<br/>communication with the police, and very energetic inquiries are<br/>being made, which will probably result in a speedy clearing up of<br/>this very singular business. Up to a late hour last night, however,<br/>nothing had transpired as to the whereabouts of the missing lady.<br/>There are rumours of foul play in the matter, and it is said that<br/>the police have caused the arrest of the woman who had caused the<br/>original disturbance, in the belief that, from jealousy or some<br/>other motive, she may have been concerned in the strange<br/>disappearance of the bride.'"<br/><br/>"And is that all?"<br/><br/>"Only one little item in another of the morning papers, but it<br/>is a suggestive one."<br/><br/>
