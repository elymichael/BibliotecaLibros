<br/>"This photograph!"<br/><br/>The King stared at him in amazement.<br/><br/>"Irene's photograph!" he cried. "Certainly, if you wish it."<br/><br/>"I thank your Majesty. Then there is no more to be done in the<br/>matter. I have the honour to wish you a very good-morning." He<br/>bowed, and, turning away without observing the hand which the King<br/>had stretched out to him, he set off in my company for his<br/>chambers.<br/><br/>And that was how a great scandal threatened to affect the<br/>kingdom of Bohemia, and how the best plans of Mr. Sherlock Holmes<br/>were beaten by a woman's wit. He used to make merry over the<br/>cleverness of women, but I have not heard him do it of late. And<br/>when he speaks of Irene Adler, or when he refers to her photograph,<br/>it is always under the honourable title of the woman.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
