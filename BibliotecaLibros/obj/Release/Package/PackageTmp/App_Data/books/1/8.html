<br/>"Then how many are there?"<br/><br/>"How many? I don't know."<br/><br/>"Quite so! You have not observed. And yet you have seen. That is<br/>just my point. Now, I know that there are seventeen steps, because<br/>I have both seen and observed. By-the-way, since you are interested<br/>in these little problems, and since you are good enough to<br/>chronicle one or two of my trifling experiences, you may be<br/>interested in this." He threw over a sheet of thick, pink-tinted<br/>note-paper which had been lying open upon the table. "It came by<br/>the last post," said he. "Read it aloud."<br/><br/>The note was undated, and without either signature or<br/>address.<br/><br/>"There will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight<br/>o'clock," it said, "a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a<br/>matter of the very deepest moment. Your recent services to one of<br/>the royal houses of Europe have shown that you are one who may<br/>safely be trusted with matters which are of an importance which can<br/>hardly be exaggerated. This account of you we have from all<br/>quarters received. Be in your chamber then at that hour, and do not<br/>take it amiss if your visitor wear a mask."<br/><br/>"This is indeed a mystery," I remarked. "What do you imagine<br/>that it means?"<br/><br/>"I have no data yet. It is a capital mistake to theorize before<br/>one has data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit<br/>theories, instead of theories to suit facts. But the note itself.<br/>What do you deduce from it?"<br/><br/>I carefully examined the writing, and the paper upon which it<br/>was written.<br/><br/>"The man who wrote it was presumably well to do," I remarked,<br/>endeavouring to imitate my companion's processes. "Such paper could<br/>not be bought under half a crown a packet. It is peculiarly strong<br/>and stiff."<br/><br/>"Peculiarâ€”that is the very word," said Holmes. "It is not an<br/>English paper at all. Hold it up to the light."<br/><br/>
