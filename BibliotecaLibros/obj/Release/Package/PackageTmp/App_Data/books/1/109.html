He took a large sheet of paper from his pocket, all covered with<br/>dates and names.<br/><br/>"I have spent the whole day," said he, "over Lloyd's registers<br/>and files of the old papers, following the future career of every<br/>vessel which touched at Pondicherry in January and February in '83.<br/>There were thirty-six ships of fair tonnage which were reported<br/>there during those months. Of these, one, the 'Lone Star,'<br/>instantly attracted my attention, since, although it was reported<br/>as having cleared from London, the name is that which is given to<br/>one of the states of the Union."<br/><br/>"Texas, I think."<br/><br/>"I was not and am not sure which; but I knew that the ship must<br/>have an American origin."<br/><br/>"What then?"<br/><br/>"I searched the Dundee records, and when I found that the barque<br/>'Lone Star' was there in January, '85, my suspicion became a<br/>certainty. I then inquired as to the vessels which lay at present<br/>in the port of London."<br/><br/>"Yes?"<br/><br/>"The 'Lone Star' had arrived here last week. I went down to the<br/>Albert Dock and found that she had been taken down the river by the<br/>early tide this morning, homeward bound to Savannah. I wired to<br/>Gravesend and learned that she had passed some time ago, and as the<br/>wind is easterly I have no doubt that she is now past the Goodwins<br/>and not very far from the Isle of Wight."<br/><br/>"What will you do, then?"<br/><br/>"Oh, I have my hand upon him. He and the two mates, are as I<br/>learn, the only native-born Americans in the ship. The others are<br/>Finns and Germans. I know, also, that they were all three away from<br/>the ship last night. I had it from the stevedore who has been<br/>loading their cargo. By the time that their sailing-ship reaches<br/>Savannah the mail-boat will have carried this letter, and the cable<br/>will have informed the police of Savannah that these three<br/>gentlemen are badly wanted here upon a charge of murder."<br/><br/>There is ever a flaw, however, in the best laid of human plans,<br/>and the murderers of John Openshaw were never to receive the orange<br/>pips which would show them that another, as cunning and as resolute<br/>as themselves, was upon their track. Very long and very severe were<br/>the equinoctial gales that year. We waited long for news of the<br/>"Lone Star" of Savannah, but none ever reached us. We did at last<br/>hear that somewhere far out in the Atlantic a shattered stern-post<br/>of a boat was seen swinging in the trough of a wave, with the<br/>letters "L. S." carved upon it, and that is all which we shall ever<br/>know of the fate of the "Lone Star."<br/>
