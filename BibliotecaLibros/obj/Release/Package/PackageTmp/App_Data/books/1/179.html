"Do not go asleep; your very life may depend upon it. Have your<br/>pistol ready in case we should need it. I will sit on the side of<br/>the bed, and you in that chair."<br/><br/>I took out my revolver and laid it on the corner of the<br/>table.<br/><br/>Holmes had brought up a long thin cane, and this he placed upon<br/>the bed beside him. By it he laid the box of matches and the stump<br/>of a candle. Then he turned down the lamp, and we were left in<br/>darkness.<br/><br/>How shall I ever forget that dreadful vigil? I could not hear a<br/>sound, not even the drawing of a breath, and yet I knew that my<br/>companion sat open-eyed, within a few feet of me, in the same state<br/>of nervous tension in which I was myself. The shutters cut off the<br/>least ray of light, and we waited in absolute darkness.<br/><br/>From outside came the occasional cry of a night-bird, and once<br/>at our very window a long drawn catlike whine, which told us that<br/>the cheetah was indeed at liberty. Far away we could hear the deep<br/>tones of the parish clock, which boomed out every quarter of an<br/>hour. How long they seemed, those quarters! Twelve struck, and one<br/>and two and three, and still we sat waiting silently for whatever<br/>might befall.<br/><br/>Suddenly there was the momentary gleam of a light up in the<br/>direction of the ventilator, which vanished immediately, but was<br/>succeeded by a strong smell of burning oil and heated metal.<br/>Someone in the next room had lit a dark-lantern. I heard a gentle<br/>sound of movement, and then all was silent once more, though the<br/>smell grew stronger. For half an hour I sat with straining ears.<br/>Then suddenly another sound became audibleâ€”a very gentle, soothing<br/>sound, like that of a small jet of steam escaping continually from<br/>a kettle. The instant that we heard it, Holmes sprang from the bed,<br/>struck a match, and lashed furiously with his cane at the<br/>bell-pull.<br/><br/>"You see it, Watson?" he yelled. "You see it?"<br/><br/>But I saw nothing. At the moment when Holmes struck the light I<br/>heard a low, clear whistle, but the sudden glare flashing into my<br/>weary eyes made it impossible for me to tell what it was at which<br/>my friend lashed so savagely. I could, however, see that his face<br/>was deadly pale and filled with horror and loathing. He had ceased<br/>to strike and was gazing up at the ventilator when suddenly there<br/>broke from the silence of the night the most horrible cry to which<br/>I have ever listened. It swelled up louder and louder, a hoarse<br/>yell of pain and fear and anger all mingled in the one dreadful<br/>shriek. They say that away down in the village, and even in the<br/>distant parsonage, that cry raised the sleepers from their beds. It<br/>struck cold to our hearts, and I stood gazing at Holmes, and he at<br/>me, until the last echoes of it had died away into the silence from<br/>which it rose.<br/><br/>"What can it mean?" I gasped.<br/><br/>"It means that it is all over," Holmes answered. "And perhaps,<br/>after all, it is for the best. Take your pistol, and we will enter<br/>Dr. Roylott's room."<br/><br/>With a grave face he lit the lamp and led the way down the<br/>corridor. Twice he struck at the chamber door without any reply<br/>from within. Then he turned the handle and entered, I at his heels,<br/>with the cocked pistol in my hand.<br/>
