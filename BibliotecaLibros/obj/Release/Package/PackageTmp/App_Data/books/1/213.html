May I ask whether you were seated at the<br/>breakfast-table so that you could see out of the window?"<br/><br/>"We could see the other side of the road and the Park."<br/><br/>"Quite so. Then I do not think that I need to detain you longer.<br/>I shall communicate with you."<br/><br/>"Should you be fortunate enough to solve this problem," said our<br/>client, rising.<br/><br/>"I have solved it."<br/><br/>"Eh? What was that?"<br/><br/>"I say that I have solved it."<br/><br/>"Where, then, is my wife?"<br/><br/>"That is a detail which I shall speedily supply."<br/><br/>Lord St. Simon shook his head. "I am afraid that it will take<br/>wiser heads than yours or mine," he remarked, and bowing in a<br/>stately, old-fashioned manner he departed.<br/><br/>"It is very good of Lord St. Simon to honour my head by putting<br/>it on a level with his own," said Sherlock Holmes, laughing. "I<br/>think that I shall have a whisky and soda and a cigar after all<br/>this cross-questioning. I had formed my conclusions as to the case<br/>before our client came into the room."<br/>
