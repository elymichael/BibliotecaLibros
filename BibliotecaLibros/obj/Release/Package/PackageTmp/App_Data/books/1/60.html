"What office?"<br/><br/>"That's the worst of it, Mr. Holmes, I don't know."<br/><br/>"Where did he live, then?"<br/><br/>"He slept on the premises."<br/><br/>"And you don't know his address?"<br/><br/>"Noâ€”except that it was Leadenhall Street."<br/><br/>"Where did you address your letters, then?"<br/><br/>"To the Leadenhall Street Post Office, to be left till called<br/>for. He said that if they were sent to the office he would be<br/>chaffed by all the other clerks about having letters from a lady,<br/>so I offered to typewrite them, like he did his, but he wouldn't<br/>have that, for he said that when I wrote them they seemed to come<br/>from me, but when they were typewritten he always felt that the<br/>machine had come between us.

He would rather walk with me<br/>in the evening than in the daylight, for he said that he hated to<br/>be conspicuous. Very retiring and gentlemanly he was. Even his<br/>voice was gentle. He'd had the quinsy and swollen glands when he<br/>was young, he told me, and it had left him with a weak throat, and<br/>a hesitating, whispering fashion of speech. He was always well<br/>dressed, very neat and plain, but his eyes were weak, just as mine<br/>are, and he wore tinted glasses against the glare."<br/><br/>"Well, and what happened when Mr. Windibank, your stepfather,<br/>returned to France?"<br/>
