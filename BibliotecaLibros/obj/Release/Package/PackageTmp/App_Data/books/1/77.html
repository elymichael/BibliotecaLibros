"'And how far from the edge of the wood?'<br/><br/>"'About the same.'<br/><br/>"'Then if it was removed it was while you were within a dozen<br/>yards of it?'<br/><br/>"'Yes, but with my back towards it.'<br/><br/>"This concluded the examination of the witness."<br/><br/>"I see," said I as I glanced down the column, "that the coroner<br/>in his concluding remarks was rather severe upon young McCarthy. He<br/>calls attention, and with reason, to the discrepancy about his<br/>father having signalled to him before seeing him, also to his<br/>refusal to give details of his conversation with his father, and<br/>his singular account of his father's dying words. They are all, as<br/>he remarks, very much against the son."<br/><br/>Holmes laughed softly to himself and stretched himself out upon<br/>the cushioned seat. "Both you and the coroner have been at some<br/>pains," said he, "to single out the very strongest points in the<br/>young man's favour. Don't you see that you alternately give him<br/>credit for having too much imagination and too little? Too little,<br/>if he could not invent a cause of quarrel which would give him the<br/>sympathy of the jury; too much, if he evolved from his own inner<br/>consciousness anything so outr√© as a dying reference to a rat, and<br/>the incident of the vanishing cloth. No, sir, I shall approach this<br/>case from the point of view that what this young man says is true,<br/>and we shall see whither that hypothesis will lead us. And now here<br/>is my pocket Petrarch, and not another word shall I say of this<br/>case until we are on the scene of action. We lunch at Swindon, and<br/>I see that we shall be there in twenty minutes."<br/><br/>It was nearly four o'clock when we at last, after passing<br/>through the beautiful Stroud Valley, and over the broad gleaming<br/>Severn, found ourselves at the pretty little country-town of Ross.<br/>A lean, ferret-like man, furtive and sly-looking, was waiting for<br/>us upon the platform. In spite of the light brown dustcoat and<br/>leather-leggings which he wore in deference to his rustic<br/>surroundings, I had no difficulty in recognising Lestrade, of<br/>Scotland Yard. With him we drove to the Hereford Arms where a room<br/>had already been engaged for us.<br/><br/>"I have ordered a carriage," said Lestrade as we sat over a cup<br/>of tea. "I knew your energetic nature, and that you would not be<br/>happy until you had been on the scene of the crime."<br/><br/>"It was very nice and complimentary of you," Holmes answered.<br/>"It is entirely a question of barometric pressure."<br/><br/>Lestrade looked startled. "I do not quite follow," he said.<br/>
