"None."<br/><br/>"One more question. How did your mother take the matter?"<br/><br/>"She was angry, and said that I was never to speak of the matter<br/>again."<br/><br/>"And your father? Did you tell him?"<br/><br/>"Yes; and he seemed to think, with me, that something had<br/>happened, and that I should hear of Hosmer again. As he said, what<br/>interest could anyone have in bringing me to the doors of the<br/>church, and then leaving me? Now, if he had borrowed my money, or<br/>if he had married me and got my money settled on him, there might<br/>be some reason, but Hosmer was very independent about money and<br/>never would look at a shilling of mine.

She pulled a<br/>little handkerchief out of her muff and began to sob heavily into<br/>it.<br/><br/>"I shall glance into the case for you," said Holmes, rising,<br/>"and I have no doubt that we shall reach some definite result.

Above all, try to let Mr. Hosmer Angel<br/>vanish from your memory, as he has done from your life."<br/><br/>"Then you don't think I'll see him again?"<br/><br/>"I fear not."<br/><br/>"Then what has happened to him?"<br/><br/>"You will leave that question in my hands. I should like an<br/>accurate description of him and any letters of his which you can<br/>spare."<br/><br/>"I advertised for him in last Saturday's Chronicle," said she.<br/>"Here is the slip and here are four letters from him."<br/>
