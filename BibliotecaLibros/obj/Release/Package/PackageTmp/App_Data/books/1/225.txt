"No doubt you think me mad?" said he.

"I see that you have had some great trouble," responded
Holmes.

"God knows I have!—a trouble which is enough to unseat my
reason, so sudden and so terrible is it. Public disgrace I might
have faced, although I am a man whose character has never yet borne
a stain. Private affliction also is the lot of every man; but the
two coming together, and in so frightful a form, have been enough
to shake my very soul. Besides, it is not I alone. The very noblest
in the land may suffer unless some way be found out of this
horrible affair."

"Pray compose yourself, sir," said Holmes, "and let me have a
clear account of who you are and what it is that has befallen
you."

"My name," answered our visitor, "is probably familiar to your
ears. I am Alexander Holder, of the banking firm of Holder &amp;
Stevenson, of Threadneedle Street."

The name was indeed well known to us as belonging to the senior
partner in the second largest private banking concern in the City
of London. What could have happened, then, to bring one of the
foremost citizens of London to this most pitiable pass? We waited,
all curiosity, until with another effort he braced himself to tell
his story.

"I feel that time is of value," said he; "that is why I hastened
here when the police inspector suggested that I should secure your
co-operation. I came to Baker Street by the Underground and hurried
from there on foot, for the cabs go slowly through this snow. That
is why I was so out of breath, for I am a man who takes very little
exercise. I feel better now, and I will put the facts before you as
shortly and yet as clearly as I can.

"It is, of course, well known to you that in a successful
banking business as much depends upon our being able to find
remunerative investments for our funds as upon our increasing our
connection and the number of our depositors. One of our most
lucrative means of laying out money is in the shape of loans, where
the security is unimpeachable. We have done a good deal in this
direction during the last few years, and there are many noble
families to whom we have advanced large sums upon the security of
their pictures, libraries, or plate.

"Yesterday morning I was seated in my office at the bank when a
card was brought in to me by one of the clerks. I started when I
saw the name, for it was that of none other than—well, perhaps even
to you I had better say no more than that it was a name which is a
household word all over the earth—one of the highest, noblest, most
exalted names in England. I was overwhelmed by the honour and
attempted, when he entered, to say so, but he plunged at once into
business with the air of a man who wishes to hurry quickly through
a disagreeable task.

"'Mr. Holder,' said he, 'I have been informed that you are in
the habit of advancing money.'
