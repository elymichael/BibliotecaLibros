I placed my revolver, cocked, upon the top of the wooden case<br/>behind which I crouched. Holmes shot the slide across the front of<br/>his lantern and left us in pitch darknessâ€”such an absolute darkness<br/>as I have never before experienced. The smell of hot metal remained<br/>to assure us that the light was still there, ready to flash out at<br/>a moment's notice. To me, with my nerves worked up to a pitch of<br/>expectancy, there was something depressing and subduing in the<br/>sudden gloom, and in the cold dank air of the vault.<br/><br/>"They have but one retreat," whispered Holmes. "That is back<br/>through the house into Saxe-Coburg Square. I hope that you have<br/>done what I asked you, Jones?"<br/><br/>"I have an inspector and two officers waiting at the front<br/>door."<br/><br/>"Then we have stopped all the holes. And now we must be silent<br/>and wait."<br/><br/>What a time it seemed! From comparing notes afterwards it was<br/>but an hour and a quarter, yet it appeared to me that the night<br/>must have almost gone and the dawn be breaking above us. My limbs<br/>were weary and stiff, for I feared to change my position; yet my<br/>nerves were worked up to the highest pitch of tension, and my<br/>hearing was so acute that I could not only hear the gentle<br/>breathing of my companions, but I could distinguish the deeper,<br/>heavier in-breath of the bulky Jones from the thin, sighing note of<br/>the bank director. From my position I could look over the case in<br/>the direction of the floor. Suddenly my eyes caught the glint of a<br/>light.<br/><br/>At first it was but a lurid spark upon the stone pavement. Then<br/>it lengthened out until it became a yellow line, and then, without<br/>any warning or sound, a gash seemed to open and a hand appeared, a<br/>white, almost womanly hand, which felt about in the centre of the<br/>little area of light. For a minute or more the hand, with its<br/>writhing fingers, protruded out of the floor. Then it was withdrawn<br/>as suddenly as it appeared, and all was dark again save the single<br/>lurid spark which marked a chink between the stones.<br/><br/>Its disappearance, however, was but momentary. With a rending,<br/>tearing sound, one of the broad, white stones turned over upon its<br/>side and left a square, gaping hole, through which streamed the<br/>light of a lantern. Over the edge there peeped a clean-cut, boyish<br/>face, which looked keenly about it, and then, with a hand on either<br/>side of the aperture, drew itself shoulder-high and waist-high,<br/>until one knee rested upon the edge. In another instant he stood at<br/>the side of the hole and was hauling after him a companion, lithe<br/>and small like himself, with a pale face and a shock of very red<br/>hair.<br/><br/>"It's all clear," he whispered. "Have you the chisel and the<br/>bags? Great Scott! Jump, Archie, jump, and I'll swing for it!"<br/><br/>Sherlock Holmes had sprung out and seized the intruder by the<br/>collar. The other dived down the hole, and I heard the sound of<br/>rending cloth as Jones clutched at his skirts. The light flashed<br/>upon the barrel of a revolver, but Holmes' hunting crop came down<br/>on the man's wrist, and the pistol clinked upon the stone<br/>floor.<br/><br/>"It's no use, John Clay," said Holmes blandly. "You have no<br/>chance at all."<br/><br/>"So I see," the other answered with the utmost coolness. "I<br/>fancy that my pal is all right, though I see you have got his<br/>coat-tails."<br/>
