"What!" he roared.<br/><br/>"Yes, to-day." She stood smiling, holding up a little slip of<br/>paper in the air.<br/><br/>"May I see it?"<br/><br/>"Certainly."<br/><br/>He snatched it from her in his eagerness, and smoothing it out<br/>upon the table he drew over the lamp and examined it intently. I<br/>had left my chair and was gazing at it over his shoulder. The<br/>envelope was a very coarse one and was stamped with the Gravesend<br/>postmark and with the date of that very day, or rather of the day<br/>before, for it was considerably after midnight.<br/><br/>"Coarse writing," murmured Holmes. "Surely this is not your<br/>husband's writing, madam."<br/><br/>"No, but the enclosure is."<br/><br/>"I perceive also that whoever addressed the envelope had to go<br/>and inquire as to the address."<br/><br/>"How can you tell that?"<br/><br/>"The name, you see, is in perfectly black ink, which has dried<br/>itself. The rest is of the greyish colour, which shows that<br/>blotting-paper has been used. If it had been written straight off,<br/>and then blotted, none would be of a deep black shade. This man has<br/>written the name, and there has then been a pause before he wrote<br/>the address, which can only mean that he was not familiar with it.<br/>It is, of course, a trifle, but there is nothing so important as<br/>trifles. Let us now see the letter. Ha! there has been an enclosure<br/>here!"<br/><br/>"Yes, there was a ring. His signet-ring."<br/>
