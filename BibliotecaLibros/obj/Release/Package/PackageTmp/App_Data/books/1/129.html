<br/>"Oh, he gives no trouble. But he is a dirty scoundrel."<br/><br/>"Dirty?"<br/><br/>"Yes, it is all we can do to make him wash his hands, and his<br/>face is as black as a tinker's. Well, when once his case has been<br/>settled, he will have a regular prison bath; and I think, if you<br/>saw him, you would agree with me that he needed it."<br/><br/>"I should like to see him very much."<br/><br/>"Would you? That is easily done. Come this way. You can leave<br/>your bag."<br/><br/>"No, I think that I'll take it."<br/><br/>"Very good. Come this way, if you please."

"Here it<br/>is!" He quietly shot back a panel in the upper part of the door and<br/>glanced through.<br/><br/>"He is asleep," said he. "You can see him very well."<br/><br/>We both put our eyes to the grating. The prisoner lay with his<br/>face towards us, in a very deep sleep, breathing slowly and<br/>heavily. He was a middle-sized man, coarsely clad as became his<br/>calling, with a coloured shirt protruding through the rent in his<br/>tattered coat. He was, as the inspector had said, extremely dirty,<br/>but the grime which covered his face could not conceal its<br/>repulsive ugliness. A broad wheal from an old scar ran right across<br/>it from eye to chin, and by its contraction had turned up one side<br/>of the upper lip, so that three teeth were exposed in a perpetual<br/>snarl. A shock of very bright red hair grew low over his eyes and<br/>forehead.<br/><br/>
