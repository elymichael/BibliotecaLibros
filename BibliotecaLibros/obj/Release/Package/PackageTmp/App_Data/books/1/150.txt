"Ha! this may save us a visit to Brixton Road," whispered
Holmes. "Come with me, and we will see what is to be made of this
fellow." Striding through the scattered knots of people who lounged
round the flaring stalls, my companion speedily overtook the little
man and touched him upon the shoulder. He sprang round, and I could
see in the gas-light that every vestige of colour had been driven
from his face.

"Who are you, then? What do you want?" he asked in a quavering
voice.

"You will excuse me," said Holmes blandly, "but I could not help
overhearing the questions which you put to the salesman just now. I
think that I could be of assistance to you."

"You? Who are you? How could you know anything of the
matter?"

"My name is Sherlock Holmes. It is my business to know what
other people don't know."

"But you can know nothing of this?"

"Excuse me, I know everything of it. You are endeavouring to
trace some geese which were sold by Mrs. Oakshott, of Brixton Road,
to a salesman named Breckinridge, by him in turn to Mr. Windigate,
of the Alpha, and by him to his club, of which Mr. Henry Baker is a
member."

"Oh, sir, you are the very man whom I have longed to meet,"
cried the little fellow with outstretched hands and quivering
fingers. "I can hardly explain to you how interested I am in this
matter."

Sherlock Holmes hailed a four-wheeler which was passing. "In
that case we had better discuss it in a cosy room rather than in
this wind-swept market-place," said he. "But pray tell me, before
we go farther, who it is that I have the pleasure of
assisting."

The man hesitated for an instant. "My name is John Robinson," he
answered with a sidelong glance.
