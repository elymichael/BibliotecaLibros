Four or five minutes afterwards the sitting-room<br/>window will open. You are to station yourself close to that open<br/>window."<br/><br/>"Yes."<br/><br/>"You are to watch me, for I will be visible to you."<br/><br/>"Yes."<br/><br/>"And when I raise my hand—so—you will throw into the room what I<br/>give you to throw, and will, at the same time, raise the cry of<br/>fire. You quite follow me?"<br/><br/>"Entirely."<br/><br/>"It is nothing very formidable," he said, taking a long cigar-<br/>shaped roll from his pocket. "It is an ordinary plumber's smoke-<br/>rocket, fitted with a cap at either end to make it self-lighting.<br/>Your task is confined to that. When you raise your cry of fire, it<br/>will be taken up by quite a number of people. You may then walk to<br/>the end of the street, and I will rejoin you in ten minutes. I hope<br/>that I have made myself clear?"<br/><br/>"I am to remain neutral, to get near the window, to watch you,<br/>and at the signal to throw in this object, then to raise the cry of<br/>fire, and to wait you at the corner of the street."<br/><br/>"Precisely."<br/><br/>
