"Really, now!" cried the inspector, "you have formed your<br/>opinion! Come, now, we shall see who agrees with you. I say it is<br/>south, for the country is more deserted there."<br/><br/>"And I say east," said my patient.<br/><br/>"I am for west," remarked the plain-clothes man. "There are<br/>several quiet little villages up there."<br/><br/>"And I am for north," said I, "because there are no hills there,<br/>and our friend says that he did not notice the carriage go up<br/>any."<br/><br/>"Come," cried the inspector, laughing; "it's a very pretty<br/>diversity of opinion. We have boxed the compass among us. Who do<br/>you give your casting vote to?"<br/><br/>"You are all wrong."<br/><br/>"But we can't all be."<br/><br/>"Oh, yes, you can. This is my point." He placed his finger in<br/>the centre of the circle. "This is where we shall find them."<br/><br/>"But the twelve-mile drive?" gasped Hatherley.<br/><br/>"Six out and six back. Nothing simpler. You say yourself that<br/>the horse was fresh and glossy when you got in. How could it be<br/>that if it had gone twelve miles over heavy roads?"<br/><br/>"Indeed, it is a likely ruse enough," observed Bradstreet<br/>thoughtfully. "Of course there can be no doubt as to the nature of<br/>this gang."<br/>
