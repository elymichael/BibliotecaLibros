<br/>"No, no, he found it. Its owner is unknown. I beg that you will<br/>look upon it not as a battered billycock but as an intellectual<br/>problem. And, first, as to how it came here. It arrived upon<br/>Christmas morning, in company with a good fat goose, which is, I<br/>have no doubt, roasting at this moment in front of Peterson's fire.<br/>The facts are these: about four o'clock on Christmas morning,<br/>Peterson, who, as you know, is a very honest fellow, was returning<br/>from some small jollification and was making his way homeward down<br/>Tottenham Court Road. In front of him he saw, in the gaslight, a<br/>tallish man, walking with a slight stagger, and carrying a white<br/>goose slung over his shoulder. As he reached the corner of Goodge<br/>Street, a row broke out between this stranger and a little knot of<br/>roughs. One of the latter knocked off the man's hat, on which he<br/>raised his stick to defend himself and, swinging it over his head,<br/>smashed the shop window behind him. Peterson had rushed forward to<br/>protect the stranger from his assailants; but the man, shocked at<br/>having broken the window, and seeing an official-looking person in<br/>uniform rushing towards him, dropped his goose, took to his heels,<br/>and vanished amid the labyrinth of small streets which lie at the<br/>back of Tottenham Court Road. The roughs had also fled at the<br/>appearance of Peterson, so that he was left in possession of the<br/>field of battle, and also of the spoils of victory in the shape of<br/>this battered hat and a most unimpeachable Christmas goose."<br/><br/>"Which surely he restored to their owner?"<br/><br/>"My dear fellow, there lies the problem. It is true that 'For<br/>Mrs. Henry Baker' was printed upon a small card which was tied to<br/>the bird's left leg, and it is also true that the initials 'H. B.'<br/>are legible upon the lining of this hat, but as there are some<br/>thousands of Bakers, and some hundreds of Henry Bakers in this city<br/>of ours, it is not easy to restore lost property to any one of<br/>them."<br/><br/>"What, then, did Peterson do?"<br/><br/>"He brought round both hat and goose to me on Christmas morning,<br/>knowing that even the smallest problems are of interest to me. The<br/>goose we retained until this morning, when there were signs that,<br/>in spite of the slight frost, it would be well that it should be<br/>eaten without unnecessary delay. Its finder has carried it off,<br/>therefore, to fulfil the ultimate destiny of a goose, while I<br/>continue to retain the hat of the unknown gentleman who lost his<br/>Christmas dinner."<br/><br/>"Did he not advertise?"<br/><br/>"No."<br/><br/>"Then, what clue could you have as to his identity?"<br/><br/>"Only as much as we can deduce."<br/><br/>"From his hat?"<br/><br/>
