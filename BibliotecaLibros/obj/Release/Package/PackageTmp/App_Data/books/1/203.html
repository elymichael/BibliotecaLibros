"I have very little difficulty in finding what I want," said I,<br/>"for the facts are quite recent, and the matter struck me as<br/>remarkable. I feared to refer them to you, however, as I knew that<br/>you had an inquiry on hand and that you disliked the intrusion of<br/>other matters."<br/><br/>"Oh, you mean the little problem of the Grosvenor Square<br/>furniture van. That is quite cleared up now—though, indeed, it was<br/>obvious from the first. Pray give me the results of your newspaper<br/>selections."<br/><br/>"Here is the first notice which I can find. It is in the<br/>personal column of the Morning Post, and dates, as you see, some<br/>weeks back: 'A marriage has been arranged,' it says, 'and will, if<br/>rumour is correct, very shortly take place, between Lord Robert St.<br/>Simon, second son of the Duke of Balmoral, and Miss Hatty Doran,<br/>the only daughter of Aloysius Doran. Esq., of San Francisco, Cal.,<br/>U.S.A.' That is all."<br/><br/>"Terse and to the point," remarked Holmes, stretching his long,<br/>thin legs towards the fire.<br/><br/>"There was a paragraph amplifying this in one of the society<br/>papers of the same week. Ah, here it is: 'There will soon be a call<br/>for protection in the marriage market, for the present free-trade<br/>principle appears to tell heavily against our home product. One by<br/>one the management of the noble houses of Great Britain is passing<br/>into the hands of our fair cousins from across the Atlantic. An<br/>important addition has been made during the last week to the list<br/>of the prizes which have been borne away by these charming<br/>invaders. Lord St. Simon, who has shown himself for over twenty<br/>years proof against the little god's arrows, has now definitely<br/>announced his approaching marriage with Miss Hatty Doran, the<br/>fascinating daughter of a California millionaire. Miss Doran, whose<br/>graceful figure and striking face attracted much attention at the<br/>Westbury House festivities, is an only child, and it is currently<br/>reported that her dowry will run to considerably over the six<br/>figures, with expectancies for the future. As it is an open secret<br/>that the Duke of Balmoral has been compelled to sell his pictures<br/>within the last few years, and as Lord St. Simon has no property of<br/>his own save the small estate of Birchmoor, it is obvious that the<br/>Californian heiress is not the only gainer by an alliance which<br/>will enable her to make the easy and common transition from a<br/>Republican lady to a British peeress.'"<br/><br/>"Anything else?" asked Holmes, yawning.<br/><br/>"Oh, yes; plenty. Then there is another note in the Morning Post<br/>to say that the marriage would be an absolutely quiet one, that it<br/>would be at St. George's, Hanover Square, that only half a dozen<br/>intimate friends would be invited, and that the party would return<br/>to the furnished house at Lancaster Gate which has been taken by<br/>Mr. Aloysius Doran. Two days later—that is, on Wednesday last—there<br/>is a curt announcement that the wedding had taken place, and that<br/>the honeymoon would be passed at Lord Backwater's place, near<br/>Petersfield. Those are all the notices which appeared before the<br/>disappearance of the bride."<br/><br/>"Before the what?" asked Holmes with a start.<br/><br/>"The vanishing of the lady."<br/><br/>"When did she vanish, then?"<br/><br/>"At the wedding breakfast."<br/>
