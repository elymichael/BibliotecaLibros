"The man married a woman very much older than himself for her<br/>money," said he, "and he enjoyed the use of the money of the<br/>daughter as long as she lived with them. It was a considerable sum,<br/>for people in their position, and the loss of it would have made a<br/>serious difference. It was worth an effort to preserve it. The<br/>daughter was of a good, amiable disposition, but affectionate and<br/>warm-hearted in her ways, so that it was evident that with her fair<br/>personal advantages, and her little income, she would not be<br/>allowed to remain single long. Now her marriage would mean, of<br/>course, the loss of a hundred a year, so what does her stepfather<br/>do to prevent it? He takes the obvious course of keeping her at<br/>home and forbidding her to seek the company of people of her own<br/>age. But soon he found that that would not answer forever. She<br/>became restive, insisted upon her rights, and finally announced her<br/>positive intention of going to a certain ball. What does her clever<br/>stepfather do then? He conceives an idea more creditable to his<br/>head than to his heart. With the connivance and assistance of his<br/>wife he disguised himself, covered those keen eyes with tinted<br/>glasses, masked the face with a moustache and a pair of bushy<br/>whiskers, sunk that clear voice into an insinuating whisper, and<br/>doubly secure on account of the girl's short sight, he appears as<br/>Mr. Hosmer Angel, and keeps off other lovers by making love<br/>himself."<br/><br/>"It was only a joke at first," groaned our visitor. "We never<br/>thought that she would have been so carried away."<br/><br/>"Very likely not. However that may be, the young lady was very<br/>decidedly carried away, and, having quite made up her mind that her<br/>stepfather was in France, the suspicion of treachery never for an<br/>instant entered her mind. She was flattered by the gentleman's<br/>attentions, and the effect was increased by the loudly expressed<br/>admiration of her mother. Then Mr. Angel began to call, for it was<br/>obvious that the matter should be pushed as far as it would go if a<br/>real effect were to be produced. There were meetings, and an<br/>engagement, which would finally secure the girl's affections from<br/>turning towards anyone else. But the deception could not be kept up<br/>forever. These pretended journeys to France were rather cumbrous.<br/>The thing to do was clearly to bring the business to an end in such<br/>a dramatic manner that it would leave a permanent impression upon<br/>the young lady's mind and prevent her from looking upon any other<br/>suitor for some time to come. Hence those vows of fidelity exacted<br/>upon a Testament, and hence also the allusions to a possibility of<br/>something happening on the very morning of the wedding. James<br/>Windibank wished Miss Sutherland to be so bound to Hosmer Angel,<br/>and so uncertain as to his fate, that for ten years to come, at any<br/>rate, she would not listen to another man. As far as the church<br/>door he brought her, and then, as he could go no farther, he<br/>conveniently vanished away by the old trick of stepping in at one<br/>door of a four-wheeler and out at the other. I think that was the<br/>chain of events, Mr. Windibank!"<br/><br/>Our visitor had recovered something of his assurance while<br/>Holmes had been talking, and he rose from his chair now with a cold<br/>sneer upon his pale face.<br/><br/>"It may be so, or it may not, Mr. Holmes," said he, "but if you<br/>are so very sharp you ought to be sharp enough to know that it is<br/>you who are breaking the law now, and not me. I have done nothing<br/>actionable from the first, but as long as you keep that door locked<br/>you lay yourself open to an action for assault and illegal<br/>constraint."<br/><br/>"The law cannot, as you say, touch you," said Holmes, unlocking<br/>and throwing open the door, "yet there never was a man who deserved<br/>punishment more. If the young lady has a brother or a friend, he<br/>ought to lay a whip across your shoulders. By Jove!" he continued,<br/>flushing up at the sight of the bitter sneer upon the man's face,<br/>"it is not part of my duties to my client, but here's a hunting<br/>crop handy, and I think I shall just treat myself to—" He took two<br/>swift steps to the whip, but before he could grasp it there was a<br/>wild clatter of steps upon the stairs, the heavy hall door banged,<br/>and from the window we could see Mr. James Windibank running at the<br/>top of his speed down the road.<br/><br/>"There's a cold-blooded scoundrel!" said Holmes, laughing, as he<br/>threw himself down into his chair once more. "That fellow will rise<br/>from crime to crime until he does something very bad, and ends on a<br/>gallows. The case has, in some respects, been not entirely devoid<br/>of interest."<br/><br/>"I cannot now entirely see all the steps of your reasoning," I<br/>remarked.<br/><br/>"Well, of course it was obvious from the first that this Mr.<br/>Hosmer Angel must have some strong object for his curious conduct,<br/>and it was equally clear that the only man who really profited by<br/>the incident, as far as we could see, was the stepfather. Then the<br/>fact that the two men were never together, but that the one always<br/>appeared when the other was away, was suggestive. So were the<br/>tinted spectacles and the curious voice, which both hinted at a<br/>disguise, as did the bushy whiskers. My suspicions were all<br/>confirmed by his peculiar action in typewriting his signature,<br/>which, of course, inferred that his handwriting was so familiar to<br/>her that she would recognise even the smallest sample of it. You<br/>see all these isolated facts, together with many minor ones, all<br/>pointed in the same direction."<br/><br/>"And how did you verify them?"<br/><br/>"Having once spotted my man, it was easy to get corroboration. I<br/>knew the firm for which this man worked. Having taken the printed<br/>description. I eliminated everything from it which could be the<br/>result of a disguise—the whiskers, the glasses, the voice, and I<br/>sent it to the firm, with a request that they would inform me<br/>whether it answered to the description of any of their travellers.<br/>I had already noticed the peculiarities of the typewriter, and I<br/>wrote to the man himself at his business address asking him if he<br/>would come here. As I expected, his reply was typewritten and<br/>revealed the same trivial but characteristic defects. The same post<br/>brought me a letter from Westhouse &amp; Marbank, of Fenchurch<br/>Street, to say that the description tallied in every respect with<br/>that of their employé, James Windibank. Voilà tout!"<br/>
