"Yes, the lodge-keeper brought it up. You said that you wished<br/>to see me here to avoid scandal."<br/><br/>"I thought people would talk if I went to the Hall."<br/><br/>"And why did you wish to see me?" He looked across at my<br/>companion with despair in his weary eyes, as though his question<br/>was already answered.<br/><br/>"Yes," said Holmes, answering the look rather than the words.<br/>"It is so. I know all about McCarthy."<br/><br/>The old man sank his face in his hands. "God help me!" he cried.<br/>"But I would not have let the young man come to harm. I give you my<br/>word that I would have spoken out if it went against him at the<br/>Assizes."<br/><br/>"I am glad to hear you say so," said Holmes gravely.<br/><br/>"I would have spoken now had it not been for my dear girl. It<br/>would break her heartâ€”it will break her heart when she hears that I<br/>am arrested."<br/><br/>"It may not come to that," said Holmes.<br/><br/>"What?"<br/><br/>"I am no official agent. I understand that it was your daughter<br/>who required my presence here, and I am acting in her interests.<br/>Young McCarthy must be got off, however."<br/><br/>"I am a dying man," said old Turner. "I have had diabetes for<br/>years. My doctor says it is a question whether I shall live a<br/>month. Yet I would rather die under my own roof than in a<br/>gaol."<br/>
