"My dear Watson, you as a medical man are continually gaining<br/>light as to the tendencies of a child by the study of the parents.<br/>Don't you see that the converse is equally valid. I have frequently<br/>gained my first real insight into the character of parents by<br/>studying their children. This child's disposition is abnormally<br/>cruel, merely for cruelty's sake, and whether he derives this from<br/>his smiling father, as I should suspect, or from his mother, it<br/>bodes evil for the poor girl who is in their power."<br/><br/>"I am sure that you are right, Mr. Holmes," cried our client. "A<br/>thousand things come back to me which make me certain that you have<br/>hit it. Oh, let us lose not an instant in bringing help to this<br/>poor creature."<br/><br/>"We must be circumspect, for we are dealing with a very cunning<br/>man. We can do nothing until seven o'clock. At that hour we shall<br/>be with you, and it will not be long before we solve the<br/>mystery."<br/><br/>We were as good as our word, for it was just seven when we<br/>reached the Copper Beeches, having put up our trap at a wayside<br/>public-house. The group of trees, with their dark leaves shining<br/>like burnished metal in the light of the setting sun, were<br/>sufficient to mark the house even had Miss Hunter not been standing<br/>smiling on the door-step.<br/><br/>"Have you managed it?" asked Holmes.<br/><br/>A loud thudding noise came from somewhere downstairs. "That is<br/>Mrs. Toller in the cellar," said she. "Her husband lies snoring on<br/>the kitchen rug. Here are his keys, which are the duplicates of Mr.<br/>Rucastle's."<br/><br/>"You have done well indeed!" cried Holmes with enthusiasm. "Now<br/>lead the way, and we shall soon see the end of this black<br/>business."<br/><br/>We passed up the stair, unlocked the door, followed on down a<br/>passage, and found ourselves in front of the barricade which Miss<br/>Hunter had described. Holmes cut the cord and removed the<br/>transverse bar. Then he tried the various keys in the lock, but<br/>without success. No sound came from within, and at the silence<br/>Holmes' face clouded over.<br/><br/>"I trust that we are not too late," said he. "I think, Miss<br/>Hunter, that we had better go in without you. Now, Watson, put your<br/>shoulder to it, and we shall see whether we cannot make our way<br/>in."<br/><br/>It was an old rickety door and gave at once before our united<br/>strength. Together we rushed into the room. It was empty. There was<br/>no furniture save a little pallet bed, a small table, and a<br/>basketful of linen. The skylight above was open, and the prisoner<br/>gone.<br/><br/>"There has been some villainy here," said Holmes; "this beauty<br/>has guessed Miss Hunter's intentions and has carried his victim<br/>off."<br/>
