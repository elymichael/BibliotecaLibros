"I did as he ordered, and when the lawyer arrived I was asked to<br/>step up to the room. The fire was burning brightly, and in the<br/>grate there was a mass of black, fluffy ashes, as of burned paper,<br/>while the brass box stood open and empty beside it. As I glanced at<br/>the box I noticed, with a start, that upon the lid was printed the<br/>treble K which I had read in the morning upon the envelope.<br/><br/>"'I wish you, John,' said my uncle, 'to witness my will. I leave<br/>my estate, with all its advantages and all its disadvantages, to my<br/>brother, your father, whence it will, no doubt, descend to you. If<br/>you can enjoy it in peace, well and good! If you find you cannot,<br/>take my advice, my boy, and leave it to your deadliest enemy. I am<br/>sorry to give you such a two-edged thing, but I can't say what turn<br/>things are going to take. Kindly sign the paper where Mr. Fordham<br/>shows you.'<br/><br/>"I signed the paper as directed, and the lawyer took it away<br/>with him. The singular incident made, as you may think, the deepest<br/>impression upon me, and I pondered over it and turned it every way<br/>in my mind without being able to make anything of it. Yet I could<br/>not shake off the vague feeling of dread which it left behind,<br/>though the sensation grew less keen as the weeks passed and nothing<br/>happened to disturb the usual routine of our lives. I could see a<br/>change in my uncle, however. He drank more than ever, and he was<br/>less inclined for any sort of society. Most of his time he would<br/>spend in his room, with the door locked upon the inside, but<br/>sometimes he would emerge in a sort of drunken frenzy and would<br/>burst out of the house and tear about the garden with a revolver in<br/>his hand, screaming out that he was afraid of no man, and that he<br/>was not to be cooped up, like a sheep in a pen, by man or devil.<br/>When these hot fits were over, however, he would rush tumultuously<br/>in at the door and lock and bar it behind him, like a man who can<br/>brazen it out no longer against the terror which lies at the roots<br/>of his soul. At such times I have seen his face, even on a cold<br/>day, glisten with moisture, as though it were new raised from a<br/>basin.<br/><br/>"Well, to come to an end of the matter, Mr. Holmes, and not to<br/>abuse your patience, there came a night when he made one of those<br/>drunken sallies from which he never came back. We found him, when<br/>we went to search for him, face downward in a little green-scummed<br/>pool, which lay at the foot of the garden. There was no sign of any<br/>violence, and the water was but two feet deep, so that the jury,<br/>having regard to his known eccentricity, brought in a verdict of<br/>'suicide.' But I, who knew how he winced from the very thought of<br/>death, had much ado to persuade myself that he had gone out of his<br/>way to meet it. The matter passed, however, and my father entered<br/>into possession of the estate, and of some 14,000 pounds, which lay<br/>to his credit at the bank."<br/><br/>"One moment," Holmes interposed, "your statement is, I foresee,<br/>one of the most remarkable to which I have ever listened. Let me<br/>have the date of the reception by your uncle of the letter, and the<br/>date of his supposed suicide."<br/><br/>"The letter arrived on March 10, 1883. His death was seven weeks<br/>later, upon the night of May 2nd."<br/><br/>"Thank you. Pray proceed."<br/><br/>"When my father took over the Horsham property, he, at my<br/>request, made a careful examination of the attic, which had been<br/>always locked up. We found the brass box there, although its<br/>contents had been destroyed. On the inside of the cover was a paper<br/>label, with the initials of K. K. K. repeated upon it, and<br/>'Letters, memoranda, receipts, and a register' written beneath.<br/>These, we presume, indicated the nature of the papers which had<br/>been destroyed by Colonel Openshaw. For the rest, there was nothing<br/>of much importance in the attic save a great many scattered papers<br/>and note-books bearing upon my uncle's life in America. Some of<br/>them were of the war time and showed that he had done his duty well<br/>and had borne the repute of a brave soldier. Others were of a date<br/>during the reconstruction of the Southern states, and were mostly<br/>concerned with politics, for he had evidently taken a strong part<br/>in opposing the carpet-bag politicians who had been sent down from<br/>the North.<br/><br/>"Well, it was the beginning of '84 when my father came to live<br/>at Horsham, and all went as well as possible with us until the<br/>January of '85. On the fourth day after the new year I heard my<br/>father give a sharp cry of surprise as we sat together at the<br/>breakfast-table. There he was, sitting with a newly opened envelope<br/>in one hand and five dried orange pips in the outstretched palm of<br/>the other one. He had always laughed at what he called my<br/>cock-and-bull story about the colonel, but he looked very scared<br/>and puzzled now that the same thing had come upon himself.<br/><br/>"'Why, what on earth does this mean, John?' he stammered.<br/><br/>"My heart had turned to lead. 'It is K. K. K.,' said I.<br/>
