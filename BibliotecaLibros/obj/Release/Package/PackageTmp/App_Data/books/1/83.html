"Anyhow, I have grasped one fact which you seem to find it<br/>difficult to get hold of," replied Lestrade with some warmth.<br/><br/>"And that is—"<br/><br/>"That McCarthy senior met his death from McCarthy junior and<br/>that all theories to the contrary are the merest moonshine."<br/><br/>"Well, moonshine is a brighter thing than fog," said Holmes,<br/>laughing. "But I am very much mistaken if this is not Hatherley<br/>Farm upon the left."<br/><br/>"Yes, that is it." It was a widespread, comfortable-looking<br/>building, two-storied, slate-roofed, with great yellow blotches of<br/>lichen upon the grey walls. The drawn blinds and the smokeless<br/>chimneys, however, gave it a stricken look, as though the weight of<br/>this horror still lay heavy upon it. We called at the door, when<br/>the maid, at Holmes' request, showed us the boots which her master<br/>wore at the time of his death, and also a pair of the son's, though<br/>not the pair which he had then had. Having measured these very<br/>carefully from seven or eight different points, Holmes desired to<br/>be led to the court-yard, from which we all followed the winding<br/>track which led to Boscombe Pool.<br/><br/>Sherlock Holmes was transformed when he was hot upon such a<br/>scent as this. Men who had only known the quiet thinker and<br/>logician of Baker Street would have failed to recognise him. His<br/>face flushed and darkened. His brows were drawn into two hard black<br/>lines, while his eyes shone out from beneath them with a steely<br/>glitter. His face was bent downward, his shoulders bowed, his lips<br/>compressed, and the veins stood out like whipcord in his long,<br/>sinewy neck. His nostrils seemed to dilate with a purely animal<br/>lust for the chase, and his mind was so absolutely concentrated<br/>upon the matter before him that a question or remark fell unheeded<br/>upon his ears, or, at the most, only provoked a quick, impatient<br/>snarl in reply. Swiftly and silently he made his way along the<br/>track which ran through the meadows, and so by way of the woods to<br/>the Boscombe Pool. It was damp, marshy ground, as is all that<br/>district, and there were marks of many feet, both upon the path and<br/>amid the short grass which bounded it on either side. Sometimes<br/>Holmes would hurry on, sometimes stop dead, and once he made quite<br/>a little detour into the meadow. Lestrade and I walked behind him,<br/>the detective indifferent and contemptuous, while I watched my<br/>friend with the interest which sprang from the conviction that<br/>every one of his actions was directed towards a definite end.<br/><br/>The Boscombe Pool, which is a little reed-girt sheet of water<br/>some fifty yards across, is situated at the boundary between the<br/>Hatherley Farm and the private park of the wealthy Mr. Turner.<br/>Above the woods which lined it upon the farther side we could see<br/>the red, jutting pinnacles which marked the site of the rich<br/>landowner's dwelling. On the Hatherley side of the pool the woods<br/>grew very thick, and there was a narrow belt of sodden grass twenty<br/>paces across between the edge of the trees and the reeds which<br/>lined the lake. Lestrade showed us the exact spot at which the body<br/>had been found, and, indeed, so moist was the ground, that I could<br/>plainly see the traces which had been left by the fall of the<br/>stricken man. To Holmes, as I could see by his eager face and<br/>peering eyes, very many other things were to be read upon the<br/>trampled grass. He ran round, like a dog who is picking up a scent,<br/>and then turned upon my companion.<br/><br/>"What did you go into the pool for?" he asked.<br/><br/>"I fished about with a rake. I thought there might be some<br/>weapon or other trace. But how on earth—"<br/><br/>"Oh, tut, tut! I have no time! That left foot of yours with its<br/>inward twist is all over the place. A mole could trace it, and<br/>there it vanishes among the reeds. Oh, how simple it would all have<br/>been had I been here before they came like a herd of buffalo and<br/>wallowed all over it. Here is where the party with the lodge-keeper<br/>came, and they have covered all tracks for six or eight feet round<br/>the body. But here are three separate tracks of the same feet." He<br/>drew out a lens and lay down upon his waterproof to have a better<br/>view, talking all the time rather to himself than to us. "These are<br/>young McCarthy's feet. Twice he was walking, and once he ran<br/>swiftly, so that the soles are deeply marked and the heels hardly<br/>visible. That bears out his story. He ran when he saw his father on<br/>the ground. Then here are the father's feet as he paced up and<br/>down. What is this, then? It is the butt-end of the gun as the son<br/>stood listening. And this? Ha, ha! What have we here? Tiptoes!<br/>tiptoes! Square, too, quite unusual boots! They come, they go, they<br/>come again—of course that was for the cloak. Now where did they<br/>come from?" He ran up and down, sometimes losing, sometimes finding<br/>the track until we were well within the edge of the wood and under<br/>the shadow of a great beech, the largest tree in the neighbourhood.<br/>Holmes traced his way to the farther side of this and lay down once<br/>more upon his face with a little cry of satisfaction. For a long<br/>time he remained there, turning over the leaves and dried sticks,<br/>gathering up what seemed to me to be dust into an envelope and<br/>examining with his lens not only the ground but even the bark of<br/>the tree as far as he could reach. A jagged stone was lying among<br/>the moss, and this also he carefully examined and retained. Then he<br/>followed a pathway through the wood until he came to the highroad,<br/>where all traces were lost.<br/><br/>"It has been a case of considerable interest," he remarked,<br/>returning to his natural manner. "I fancy that this grey house on<br/>the right must be the lodge. I think that I will go in and have a<br/>word with Moran, and perhaps write a little note. Having done that,<br/>we may drive back to our luncheon. You may walk to the cab, and I<br/>shall be with you presently."<br/>
