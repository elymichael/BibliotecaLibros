<br/>"And I have some business to do which will take some hours. This<br/>business at Coburg Square is serious."<br/><br/>"Why serious?"<br/><br/>"A considerable crime is in contemplation. I have every reason<br/>to believe that we shall be in time to stop it. But to-day being<br/>Saturday rather complicates matters. I shall want your help<br/>to-night."<br/><br/>"At what time?"<br/><br/>"Ten will be early enough."<br/><br/>"I shall be at Baker Street at ten."<br/><br/>"Very well. And, I say, Doctor, there may be some little danger,<br/>so kindly put your army revolver in your pocket." He waved his<br/>hand, turned on his heel, and disappeared in an instant among the<br/>crowd.<br/><br/>I trust that I am not more dense than my neighbours, but I was<br/>always oppressed with a sense of my own stupidity in my dealings<br/>with Sherlock Holmes. Here I had heard what he had heard, I had<br/>seen what he had seen, and yet from his words it was evident that<br/>he saw clearly not only what had happened but what was about to<br/>happen, while to me the whole business was still confused and<br/>grotesque. As I drove home to my house in Kensington I thought over<br/>it all, from the extraordinary story of the red-headed copier of<br/>the "Encyclopaedia" down to the visit to Saxe-Coburg Square, and<br/>the ominous words with which he had parted from me. What was this<br/>nocturnal expedition, and why should I go armed? Where were we<br/>going, and what were we to do? I had the hint from Holmes that this<br/>smooth-faced pawnbroker's assistant was a formidable manâ€”a man who<br/>might play a deep game. I tried to puzzle it out, but gave it up in<br/>despair and set the matter aside until night should bring an<br/>explanation.<br/><br/>It was a quarter-past nine when I started from home and made my<br/>way across the Park, and so through Oxford Street to Baker Street.<br/>Two hansoms were standing at the door, and as I entered the passage<br/>I heard the sound of voices from above. On entering his room I<br/>found Holmes in animated conversation with two men, one of whom I<br/>recognised as Peter Jones, the official police agent, while the<br/>other was a long, thin, sad-faced man, with a very shiny hat and<br/>oppressively respectable frock-coat.<br/><br/>"Ha! Our party is complete," said Holmes, buttoning up his<br/>pea-jacket and taking his heavy hunting crop from the rack.<br/>"Watson, I think you know Mr. Jones, of Scotland Yard? Let me<br/>introduce you to Mr. Merryweather, who is to be our companion in<br/>to-night's adventure."<br/><br/>
