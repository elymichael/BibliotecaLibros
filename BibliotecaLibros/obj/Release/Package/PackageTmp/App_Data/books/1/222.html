<br/>"It might have been difficult, but friend Lestrade held<br/>information in his hands the value of which he did not himself<br/>know. The initials were, of course, of the highest importance, but<br/>more valuable still was it to know that within a week he had<br/>settled his bill at one of the most select London hotels."<br/><br/>"How did you deduce the select?"<br/><br/>"By the select prices. Eight shillings for a bed and eightpence<br/>for a glass of sherry pointed to one of the most expensive hotels.<br/>There are not many in London which charge at that rate. In the<br/>second one which I visited in Northumberland Avenue, I learned by<br/>an inspection of the book that Francis H. Moulton, an American<br/>gentleman, had left only the day before, and on looking over the<br/>entries against him, I came upon the very items which I had seen in<br/>the duplicate bill. His letters were to be forwarded to 226 Gordon<br/>Square; so thither I travelled, and being fortunate enough to find<br/>the loving couple at home, I ventured to give them some paternal<br/>advice and to point out to them that it would be better in every<br/>way that they should make their position a little clearer both to<br/>the general public and to Lord St. Simon in particular. I invited<br/>them to meet him here, and, as you see, I made him keep the<br/>appointment."<br/><br/>"But with no very good result," I remarked. "His conduct was<br/>certainly not very gracious."<br/><br/>"Ah, Watson," said Holmes, smiling, "perhaps you would not be<br/>very gracious either, if, after all the trouble of wooing and<br/>wedding, you found yourself deprived in an instant of wife and of<br/>fortune. I think that we may judge Lord St. Simon very mercifully<br/>and thank our stars that we are never likely to find ourselves in<br/>the same position. Draw your chair up and hand me my violin, for<br/>the only problem we have still to solve is how to while away these<br/>bleak autumnal evenings."<br/><br/><br/><br/>
