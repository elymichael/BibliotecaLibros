<br/>"That is well. And the Rucastles go out to-night?"<br/><br/>"Yes."<br/><br/>"Is there a cellar with a good strong lock?"<br/><br/>"Yes, the wine-cellar."<br/><br/>"You seem to me to have acted all through this matter like a<br/>very brave and sensible girl, Miss Hunter. Do you think that you<br/>could perform one more feat? I should not ask it of you if I did<br/>not think you a quite exceptional woman."<br/><br/>"I will try. What is it?"<br/><br/>"We shall be at the Copper Beeches by seven o'clock, my friend<br/>and I. The Rucastles will be gone by that time, and Toller will, we<br/>hope, be incapable. There only remains Mrs. Toller, who might give<br/>the alarm. If you could send her into the cellar on some errand,<br/>and then turn the key upon her, you would facilitate matters<br/>immensely."<br/><br/>"I will do it."<br/><br/>"Excellent! We shall then look thoroughly into the affair. Of<br/>course there is only one feasible explanation. You have been<br/>brought there to personate someone, and the real person is<br/>imprisoned in this chamber. That is obvious. As to who this<br/>prisoner is, I have no doubt that it is the daughter, Miss Alice<br/>Rucastle, if I remember right, who was said to have gone to<br/>America. You were chosen, doubtless, as resembling her in height,<br/>figure, and the colour of your hair. Hers had been cut off, very<br/>possibly in some illness through which she has passed, and so, of<br/>course, yours had to be sacrificed also. By a curious chance you<br/>came upon her tresses. The man in the road was undoubtedly some<br/>friend of hers—possibly her fiancé—and no doubt, as you wore the<br/>girl's dress and were so like her, he was convinced from your<br/>laughter, whenever he saw you, and afterwards from your gesture,<br/>that Miss Rucastle was perfectly happy, and that she no longer<br/>desired his attentions. The dog is let loose at night to prevent<br/>him from endeavouring to communicate with her. So much is fairly<br/>clear. The most serious point in the case is the disposition of the<br/>child."<br/><br/>"What on earth has that to do with it?" I ejaculated.<br/><br/>
