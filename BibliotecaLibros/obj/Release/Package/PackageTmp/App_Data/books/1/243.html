<br/>"He knows it already. When I had cleared it all up I had an<br/>interview with him, and finding that he would not tell me the<br/>story, I told it to him, on which he had to confess that I was<br/>right and to add the very few details which were not yet quite<br/>clear to me. Your news of this morning, however, may open his<br/>lips."<br/><br/>"For heaven's sake, tell me, then, what is this extraordinary<br/>mystery!"<br/><br/>"I will do so, and I will show you the steps by which I reached<br/>it. And let me say to you, first, that which it is hardest for me<br/>to say and for you to hear: there has been an understanding between<br/>Sir George Burnwell and your niece Mary. They have now fled<br/>together."<br/><br/>"My Mary? Impossible!"<br/><br/>"It is unfortunately more than possible; it is certain. Neither<br/>you nor your son knew the true character of this man when you<br/>admitted him into your family circle. He is one of the most<br/>dangerous men in Englandâ€”a ruined gambler, an absolutely desperate<br/>villain, a man without heart or conscience. Your niece knew nothing<br/>of such men. When he breathed his vows to her, as he had done to a<br/>hundred before her, she flattered herself that she alone had<br/>touched his heart. The devil knows best what he said, but at least<br/>she became his tool and was in the habit of seeing him nearly every<br/>evening."<br/><br/>"I cannot, and I will not, believe it!" cried the banker with an<br/>ashen face.<br/><br/>"I will tell you, then, what occurred in your house last night.<br/>Your niece, when you had, as she thought, gone to your room,<br/>slipped down and talked to her lover through the window which leads<br/>into the stable lane. His footmarks had pressed right through the<br/>snow, so long had he stood there. She told him of the coronet. His<br/>wicked lust for gold kindled at the news, and he bent her to his<br/>will. I have no doubt that she loved you, but there are women in<br/>whom the love of a lover extinguishes all other loves, and I think<br/>that she must have been one. She had hardly listened to his<br/>instructions when she saw you coming downstairs, on which she<br/>closed the window rapidly and told you about one of the servants'<br/>escapade with her wooden-legged lover, which was all perfectly<br/>true.<br/><br/>"Your boy, Arthur, went to bed after his interview with you but<br/>he slept badly on account of his uneasiness about his club debts.<br/>In the middle of the night he heard a soft tread pass his door, so<br/>he rose and, looking out, was surprised to see his cousin walking<br/>very stealthily along the passage until she disappeared into your<br/>dressing-room. Petrified with astonishment, the lad slipped on some<br/>clothes and waited there in the dark to see what would come of this<br/>strange affair. Presently she emerged from the room again, and in<br/>the light of the passage-lamp your son saw that she carried the<br/>precious coronet in her hands. She passed down the stairs, and he,<br/>thrilling with horror, ran along and slipped behind the curtain<br/>near your door, whence he could see what passed in the hall<br/>beneath. He saw her stealthily open the window, hand out the<br/>coronet to someone in the gloom, and then closing it once more<br/>hurry back to her room, passing quite close to where he stood hid<br/>behind the curtain.<br/><br/>"As long as she was on the scene he could not take any action<br/>without a horrible exposure of the woman whom he loved. But the<br/>instant that she was gone he realised how crushing a misfortune<br/>this would be for you, and how all-important it was to set it<br/>right. He rushed down, just as he was, in his bare feet, opened the<br/>window, sprang out into the snow, and ran down the lane, where he<br/>could see a dark figure in the moonlight. Sir George Burnwell tried<br/>to get away, but Arthur caught him, and there was a struggle<br/>between them, your lad tugging at one side of the coronet, and his<br/>opponent at the other. In the scuffle, your son struck Sir George<br/>and cut him over the eye. Then something suddenly snapped, and your<br/>son, finding that he had the coronet in his hands, rushed back,<br/>closed the window, ascended to your room, and had just observed<br/>that the coronet had been twisted in the struggle and was<br/>endeavouring to straighten it when you appeared upon the<br/>scene."<br/><br/>"Is it possible?" gasped the banker.<br/><br/>
