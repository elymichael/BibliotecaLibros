Ryder passed his tongue over his parched lips. "I will tell you<br/>it just as it happened, sir," said he. "When Horner had been<br/>arrested, it seemed to me that it would be best for me to get away<br/>with the stone at once, for I did not know at what moment the<br/>police might not take it into their heads to search me and my room.<br/>There was no place about the hotel where it would be safe. I went<br/>out, as if on some commission, and I made for my sister's house.<br/>She had married a man named Oakshott, and lived in Brixton Road,<br/>where she fattened fowls for the market. All the way there every<br/>man I met seemed to me to be a policeman or a detective; and, for<br/>all that it was a cold night, the sweat was pouring down my face<br/>before I came to the Brixton Road. My sister asked me what was the<br/>matter, and why I was so pale; but I told her that I had been upset<br/>by the jewel robbery at the hotel. Then I went into the back yard<br/>and smoked a pipe and wondered what it would be best to do.<br/><br/>"I had a friend once called Maudsley, who went to the bad, and<br/>has just been serving his time in Pentonville. One day he had met<br/>me, and fell into talk about the ways of thieves, and how they<br/>could get rid of what they stole. I knew that he would be true to<br/>me, for I knew one or two things about him; so I made up my mind to<br/>go right on to Kilburn, where he lived, and take him into my<br/>confidence. He would show me how to turn the stone into money. But<br/>how to get to him in safety? I thought of the agonies I had gone<br/>through in coming from the hotel. I might at any moment be seized<br/>and searched, and there would be the stone in my waistcoat pocket.<br/>I was leaning against the wall at the time and looking at the geese<br/>which were waddling about round my feet, and suddenly an idea came<br/>into my head which showed me how I could beat the best detective<br/>that ever lived.<br/><br/>"My sister had told me some weeks before that I might have the<br/>pick of her geese for a Christmas present, and I knew that she was<br/>always as good as her word. I would take my goose now, and in it I<br/>would carry my stone to Kilburn. There was a little shed in the<br/>yard, and behind this I drove one of the birds—a fine big one,<br/>white, with a barred tail. I caught it, and prying its bill open, I<br/>thrust the stone down its throat as far as my finger could reach.<br/>The bird gave a gulp, and I felt the stone pass along its gullet<br/>and down into its crop. But the creature flapped and struggled, and<br/>out came my sister to know what was the matter. As I turned to<br/>speak to her the brute broke loose and fluttered off among the<br/>others.<br/><br/>"'Whatever were you doing with that bird, Jem?' says she.<br/><br/>"'Well,' said I, 'you said you'd give me one for Christmas, and<br/>I was feeling which was the fattest.'<br/><br/>"'Oh,' says she, 'we've set yours aside for you—Jem's bird, we<br/>call it. It's the big white one over yonder. There's twenty-six of<br/>them, which makes one for you, and one for us, and two dozen for<br/>the market.'<br/><br/>"'Thank you, Maggie,' says I; 'but if it is all the same to you,<br/>I'd rather have that one I was handling just now.'<br/><br/>"'The other is a good three pound heavier,' said she, 'and we<br/>fattened it expressly for you.'<br/><br/>"'Never mind. I'll have the other, and I'll take it now,' said<br/>I.<br/><br/>"'Oh, just as you like,' said she, a little huffed. 'Which is it<br/>you want, then?'<br/><br/>"'That white one with the barred tail, right in the middle of<br/>the flock.'<br/>
