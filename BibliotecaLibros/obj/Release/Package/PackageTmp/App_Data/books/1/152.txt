Our visitor staggered to his feet and clutched the mantelpiece
with his right hand. Holmes unlocked his strong-box and held up the
blue carbuncle, which shone out like a star, with a cold,
brilliant, many-pointed radiance. Ryder stood glaring with a drawn
face, uncertain whether to claim or to disown it.

"The game's up, Ryder," said Holmes quietly. "Hold up, man, or
you'll be into the fire! Give him an arm back into his chair,
Watson. He's not got blood enough to go in for felony with
impunity. Give him a dash of brandy. So! Now he looks a little more
human. What a shrimp it is, to be sure!"

For a moment he had staggered and nearly fallen, but the brandy
brought a tinge of colour into his cheeks, and he sat staring with
frightened eyes at his accuser.

"I have almost every link in my hands, and all the proofs which
I could possibly need, so there is little which you need tell me.
Still, that little may as well be cleared up to make the case
complete. You had heard, Ryder, of this blue stone of the Countess
of Morcar's?"

"It was Catherine Cusack who told me of it," said he in a
crackling voice.

"I see—her ladyship's waiting-maid. Well, the temptation of
sudden wealth so easily acquired was too much for you, as it has
been for better men before you; but you were not very scrupulous in
the means you used. It seems to me, Ryder, that there is the making
of a very pretty villain in you. You knew that this man Horner, the
plumber, had been concerned in some such matter before, and that
suspicion would rest the more readily upon him. What did you do,
then? You made some small job in my lady's room—you and your
confederate Cusack—and you managed that he should be the man sent
for. Then, when he had left, you rifled the jewel-case, raised the
alarm, and had this unfortunate man arrested. You then—"

Ryder threw himself down suddenly upon the rug and clutched at
my companion's knees. "For God's sake, have mercy!" he shrieked.
"Think of my father! Of my mother! It would break their hearts. I
never went wrong before! I never will again. I swear it. I'll swear
it on a Bible. Oh, don't bring it into court! For Christ's sake,
don't!"

"Get back into your chair!" said Holmes sternly. "It is very
well to cringe and crawl now, but you thought little enough of this
poor Horner in the dock for a crime of which he knew nothing."

"I will fly, Mr. Holmes. I will leave the country, sir. Then the
charge against him will break down."

"Hum! We will talk about that. And now let us hear a true
account of the next act. How came the stone into the goose, and how
came the goose into the open market? Tell us the truth, for there
lies your only hope of safety."
