<br/>The lady coloured deeply and covered over her injured wrist. "He<br/>is a hard man," she said, "and perhaps he hardly knows his own<br/>strength."<br/><br/>There was a long silence, during which Holmes leaned his chin<br/>upon his hands and stared into the crackling fire.<br/><br/>"This is a very deep business," he said at last. "There are a<br/>thousand details which I should desire to know before I decide upon<br/>our course of action. Yet we have not a moment to lose. If we were<br/>to come to Stoke Moran to-day, would it be possible for us to see<br/>over these rooms without the knowledge of your stepfather?"<br/><br/>"As it happens, he spoke of coming into town to-day upon some<br/>most important business. It is probable that he will be away all<br/>day, and that there would be nothing to disturb you. We have a<br/>housekeeper now, but she is old and foolish, and I could easily get<br/>her out of the way."<br/><br/>"Excellent. You are not averse to this trip, Watson?"<br/><br/>"By no means."<br/><br/>"Then we shall both come. What are you going to do<br/>yourself?"<br/><br/>"I have one or two things which I would wish to do now that I am<br/>in town. But I shall return by the twelve o'clock train, so as to<br/>be there in time for your coming."<br/><br/>"And you may expect us early in the afternoon. I have myself<br/>some small business matters to attend to. Will you not wait and<br/>breakfast?"<br/><br/>"No, I must go. My heart is lightened already since I have<br/>confided my trouble to you. I shall look forward to seeing you<br/>again this afternoon." She dropped her thick black veil over her<br/>face and glided from the room.<br/><br/>
