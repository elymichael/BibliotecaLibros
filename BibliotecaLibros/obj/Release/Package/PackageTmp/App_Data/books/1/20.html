<br/>"My cabby drove fast. I don't think I ever drove faster, but the<br/>others were there before us. The cab and the landau with their<br/>steaming horses were in front of the door when I arrived. I paid<br/>the man and hurried into the church. There was not a soul there<br/>save the two whom I had followed and a surpliced clergyman, who<br/>seemed to be expostulating with them. They were all three standing<br/>in a knot in front of the altar. I lounged up the side aisle like<br/>any other idler who has dropped into a church. Suddenly, to my<br/>surprise, the three at the altar faced round to me, and Godfrey<br/>Norton came running as hard as he could towards me.<br/><br/>"'Thank God,' he cried. 'You'll do. Come! Come!'<br/><br/>"'What then?' I asked.<br/><br/>"'Come, man, come, only three minutes, or it won't be<br/>legal.'<br/><br/>"I was half-dragged up to the altar, and before I knew where I<br/>was I found myself mumbling responses which were whispered in my<br/>ear, and vouching for things of which I knew nothing, and generally<br/>assisting in the secure tying up of Irene Adler, spinster, to<br/>Godfrey Norton, bachelor. It was all done in an instant, and there<br/>was the gentleman thanking me on the one side and the lady on the<br/>other, while the clergyman beamed on me in front. It was the most<br/>preposterous position in which I ever found myself in my life, and<br/>it was the thought of it that started me laughing just now. It<br/>seems that there had been some informality about their license,<br/>that the clergyman absolutely refused to marry them without a<br/>witness of some sort, and that my lucky appearance saved the<br/>bridegroom from having to sally out into the streets in search of a<br/>best man. The bride gave me a sovereign, and I mean to wear it on<br/>my watch-chain in memory of the occasion."<br/><br/>"This is a very unexpected turn of affairs," said I; "and what<br/>then?"<br/><br/>"Well, I found my plans very seriously menaced. It looked as if<br/>the pair might take an immediate departure, and so necessitate very<br/>prompt and energetic measures on my part. At the church door,<br/>however, they separated, he driving back to the Temple, and she to<br/>her own house. 'I shall drive out in the park at five as usual,'<br/>she said as she left him. I heard no more. They drove away in<br/>different directions, and I went off to make my own<br/>arrangements."<br/><br/>"Which are?"<br/><br/>"Some cold beef and a glass of beer," he answered, ringing the<br/>bell. "I have been too busy to think of food, and I am likely to be<br/>busier still this evening. By the way, Doctor, I shall want your<br/>co-operation."<br/><br/>"I shall be delighted."<br/><br/>
