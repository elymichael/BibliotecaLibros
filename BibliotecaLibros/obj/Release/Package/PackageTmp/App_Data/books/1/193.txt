"The newcomers were Colonel Lysander Stark and a short thick man
with a chinchilla beard growing out of the creases of his double
chin, who was introduced to me as Mr. Ferguson.

"'This is my secretary and manager,' said the colonel. 'By the
way, I was under the impression that I left this door shut just
now. I fear that you have felt the draught.'

"'On the contrary,' said I, 'I opened the door myself because I
felt the room to be a little close.'

"He shot one of his suspicious looks at me. 'Perhaps we had
better proceed to business, then,' said he. 'Mr. Ferguson and I
will take you up to see the machine.'

"'I had better put my hat on, I suppose.'

"'Oh, no, it is in the house.'

"'What, you dig fuller's-earth in the house?'

"'No, no. This is only where we compress it. But never mind
that. All we wish you to do is to examine the machine and to let us
know what is wrong with it.'

"We went upstairs together, the colonel first with the lamp, the
fat manager and I behind him. It was a labyrinth of an old house,
with corridors, passages, narrow winding staircases, and little low
doors, the thresholds of which were hollowed out by the generations
who had crossed them. There were no carpets and no signs of any
furniture above the ground floor, while the plaster was peeling off
the walls, and the damp was breaking through in green, unhealthy
blotches. I tried to put on as unconcerned an air as possible, but
I had not forgotten the warnings of the lady, even though I
disregarded them, and I kept a keen eye upon my two companions.
Ferguson appeared to be a morose and silent man, but I could see
from the little that he said that he was at least a
fellow-countryman.

"Colonel Lysander Stark stopped at last before a low door, which
he unlocked. Within was a small, square room, in which the three of
us could hardly get at one time. Ferguson remained outside, and the
colonel ushered me in.

"'We are now,' said he, 'actually within the hydraulic press,
and it would be a particularly unpleasant thing for us if anyone
were to turn it on. The ceiling of this small chamber is really the
end of the descending piston, and it comes down with the force of
many tons upon this metal floor. There are small lateral columns of
water outside which receive the force, and which transmit and
multiply it in the manner which is familiar to you. The machine
goes readily enough, but there is some stiffness in the working of
it, and it has lost a little of its force. Perhaps you will have
the goodness to look it over and to show us how we can set it
right.'
