<br/><br/><br/>The Lord St. Simon marriage, and its curious termination, have<br/>long ceased to be a subject of interest in those exalted circles in<br/>which the unfortunate bridegroom moves. Fresh scandals have<br/>eclipsed it, and their more piquant details have drawn the gossips<br/>away from this four-year-old drama. As I have reason to believe,<br/>however, that the full facts have never been revealed to the<br/>general public, and as my friend Sherlock Holmes had a considerable<br/>share in clearing the matter up, I feel that no memoir of him would<br/>be complete without some little sketch of this remarkable<br/>episode.<br/><br/>It was a few weeks before my own marriage, during the days when<br/>I was still sharing rooms with Holmes in Baker Street, that he came<br/>home from an afternoon stroll to find a letter on the table waiting<br/>for him. I had remained indoors all day, for the weather had taken<br/>a sudden turn to rain, with high autumnal winds, and the Jezail<br/>bullet which I had brought back in one of my limbs as a relic of my<br/>Afghan campaign throbbed with dull persistence. With my body in one<br/>easy-chair and my legs upon another, I had surrounded myself with a<br/>cloud of newspapers until at last, saturated with the news of the<br/>day, I tossed them all aside and lay listless, watching the huge<br/>crest and monogram upon the envelope upon the table and wondering<br/>lazily who my friend's noble correspondent could be.<br/><br/>"Here is a very fashionable epistle," I remarked as he entered.<br/>"Your morning letters, if I remember right, were from a fish-monger<br/>and a tide-waiter."<br/><br/>"Yes, my correspondence has certainly the charm of variety," he<br/>answered, smiling, "and the humbler are usually the more<br/>interesting. This looks like one of those unwelcome social<br/>summonses which call upon a man either to be bored or to lie."<br/><br/>He broke the seal and glanced over the contents.<br/><br/>"Oh, come, it may prove to be something of interest, after<br/>all."<br/><br/>"Not social, then?"<br/><br/>"No, distinctly professional."<br/><br/>"And from a noble client?"<br/><br/>"One of the highest in England."<br/>
