<br/>"They are typewritten," I remarked.<br/><br/>"Not only that, but the signature is typewritten. Look at the<br/>neat little 'Hosmer Angel' at the bottom. There is a date, you see,<br/>but no superscription except Leadenhall Street, which is rather<br/>vague. The point about the signature is very suggestive —in fact,<br/>we may call it conclusive."<br/><br/>"Of what?"<br/><br/>"My dear fellow, is it possible you do not see how strongly it<br/>bears upon the case?"<br/><br/>"I cannot say that I do unless it were that he wished to be able<br/>to deny his signature if an action for breach of promise were<br/>instituted."<br/><br/>"No, that was not the point. However, I shall write two letters,<br/>which should settle the matter. One is to a firm in the City, the<br/>other is to the young lady's stepfather, Mr. Windibank, asking him<br/>whether he could meet us here at six o'clock tomorrow evening. It<br/>is just as well that we should do business with the male relatives.<br/>And now, Doctor, we can do nothing until the answers to those<br/>letters come, so we may put our little problem upon the shelf for<br/>the interim."<br/><br/>I had had so many reasons to believe in my friend's subtle<br/>powers of reasoning and extraordinary energy in action that I felt<br/>that he must have some solid grounds for the assured and easy<br/>demeanour with which he treated the singular mystery which he had<br/>been called upon to fathom. Once only had I known him to fail, in<br/>the case of the King of Bohemia and of the Irene Adler photograph;<br/>but when I looked back to the weird business of the Sign of Four,<br/>and the extraordinary circumstances connected with the Study in<br/>Scarlet, I felt that it would be a strange tangle indeed which he<br/>could not unravel.<br/><br/>I left him then, still puffing at his black clay pipe, with the<br/>conviction that when I came again on the next evening I would find<br/>that he held in his hands all the clues which would lead up to the<br/>identity of the disappearing bridegroom of Miss Mary<br/>Sutherland.<br/><br/>A professional case of great gravity was engaging my own<br/>attention at the time, and the whole of next day I was busy at the<br/>bedside of the sufferer. It was not until close upon six o'clock<br/>that I found myself free and was able to spring into a hansom and<br/>drive to Baker Street, half afraid that I might be too late to<br/>assist at the dénouement of the little mystery. I found Sherlock<br/>Holmes alone, however, half asleep, with his long, thin form curled<br/>up in the recesses of his armchair. A formidable array of bottles<br/>and test-tubes, with the pungent cleanly smell of hydrochloric<br/>acid, told me that he had spent his day in the chemical work which<br/>was so dear to him.<br/><br/>"Well, have you solved it?" I asked as I entered.<br/><br/>
