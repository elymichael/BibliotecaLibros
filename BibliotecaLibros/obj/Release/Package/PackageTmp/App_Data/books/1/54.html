"But how could you guess what the motive was?"<br/><br/>"Had there been women in the house, I should have suspected a<br/>mere vulgar intrigue. That, however, was out of the question. The<br/>man's business was a small one, and there was nothing in his house<br/>which could account for such elaborate preparations, and such an<br/>expenditure as they were at. It must, then, be something out of the<br/>house. What could it be? I thought of the assistant's fondness for<br/>photography, and his trick of vanishing into the cellar. The<br/>cellar! There was the end of this tangled clue. Then I made<br/>inquiries as to this mysterious assistant and found that I had to<br/>deal with one of the coolest and most daring criminals in London.<br/>He was doing something in the cellar—something which took many<br/>hours a day for months on end. What could it be, once more? I could<br/>think of nothing save that he was running a tunnel to some other<br/>building.<br/><br/>"So far I had got when we went to visit the scene of action. I<br/>surprised you by beating upon the pavement with my stick. I was<br/>ascertaining whether the cellar stretched out in front or behind.<br/>It was not in front. Then I rang the bell, and, as I hoped, the<br/>assistant answered it. We have had some skirmishes, but we had<br/>never set eyes upon each other before. I hardly looked at his face.<br/>His knees were what I wished to see. You must yourself have<br/>remarked how worn, wrinkled, and stained they were. They spoke of<br/>those hours of burrowing. The only remaining point was what they<br/>were burrowing for. I walked round the corner, saw the City and<br/>Suburban Bank abutted on our friend's premises, and felt that I had<br/>solved my problem. When you drove home after the concert I called<br/>upon Scotland Yard and upon the chairman of the bank directors,<br/>with the result that you have seen."<br/><br/>"And how could you tell that they would make their attempt<br/>to-night?" I asked.<br/><br/>"Well, when they closed their League offices that was a sign<br/>that they cared no longer about Mr. Jabez Wilson's presence—in<br/>other words, that they had completed their tunnel. But it was<br/>essential that they should use it soon, as it might be discovered,<br/>or the bullion might be removed. Saturday would suit them better<br/>than any other day, as it would give them two days for their<br/>escape. For all these reasons I expected them to come<br/>to-night."<br/><br/>"You reasoned it out beautifully," I exclaimed in unfeigned<br/>admiration. "It is so long a chain, and yet every link rings<br/>true."<br/><br/>"It saved me from ennui," he answered, yawning. "Alas! I already<br/>feel it closing in upon me. My life is spent in one long effort to<br/>escape from the commonplaces of existence. These little problems<br/>help me to do so."<br/><br/>"And you are a benefactor of the race," said I.<br/><br/>He shrugged his shoulders. "Well, perhaps, after all, it is of<br/>some little use," he remarked. "'L'homme c'est rien—l'oeuvre c'est<br/>tout,' as Gustave Flaubert wrote to George Sand."<br/><br/><br/><br/>
