"No, your secret lies in London. It is there that I shall seek<br/>it."<br/><br/>"Then I shall call upon you in a day, or in two days, with news<br/>as to the box and the papers. I shall take your advice in every<br/>particular." He shook hands with us and took his leave. Outside the<br/>wind still screamed and the rain splashed and pattered against the<br/>windows. This strange, wild story seemed to have come to us from<br/>amid the mad elements—blown in upon us like a sheet of sea-weed in<br/>a gale—and now to have been reabsorbed by them once more.<br/><br/>Sherlock Holmes sat for some time in silence, with his head sunk<br/>forward and his eyes bent upon the red glow of the fire. Then he<br/>lit his pipe, and leaning back in his chair he watched the blue<br/>smoke-rings as they chased each other up to the ceiling.<br/><br/>"I think, Watson," he remarked at last, "that of all our cases<br/>we have had none more fantastic than this."<br/><br/>"Save, perhaps, the Sign of Four."<br/><br/>"Well, yes. Save, perhaps, that. And yet this John Openshaw<br/>seems to me to be walking amid even greater perils than did the<br/>Sholtos."<br/><br/>"But have you," I asked, "formed any definite conception as to<br/>what these perils are?"<br/><br/>"There can be no question as to their nature," he answered.<br/><br/>"Then what are they? Who is this K. K. K., and why does he<br/>pursue this unhappy family?"<br/><br/>Sherlock Holmes closed his eyes and placed his elbows upon the<br/>arms of his chair, with his finger-tips together. "The ideal<br/>reasoner," he remarked, "would, when he had once been shown a<br/>single fact in all its bearings, deduce from it not only all the<br/>chain of events which led up to it but also all the results which<br/>would follow from it. As Cuvier could correctly describe a whole<br/>animal by the contemplation of a single bone, so the observer who<br/>has thoroughly understood one link in a series of incidents should<br/>be able to accurately state all the other ones, both before and<br/>after. We have not yet grasped the results which the reason alone<br/>can attain to. Problems may be solved in the study which have<br/>baffled all those who have sought a solution by the aid of their<br/>senses. To carry the art, however, to its highest pitch, it is<br/>necessary that the reasoner should be able to utilise all the facts<br/>which have come to his knowledge; and this in itself implies, as<br/>you will readily see, a possession of all knowledge, which, even in<br/>these days of free education and encyclopaedias, is a somewhat rare<br/>accomplishment. It is not so impossible, however, that a man should<br/>possess all knowledge which is likely to be useful to him in his<br/>work, and this I have endeavoured in my case to do. If I remember<br/>rightly, you on one occasion, in the early days of our friendship,<br/>defined my limits in a very precise fashion."<br/><br/>"Yes," I answered, laughing. "It was a singular document.<br/>Philosophy, astronomy, and politics were marked at zero, I<br/>remember. Botany variable, geology profound as regards the<br/>mud-stains from any region within fifty miles of town, chemistry<br/>eccentric, anatomy unsystematic, sensational literature and crime<br/>records unique, violin-player, boxer, swordsman, lawyer, and<br/>self-poisoner by cocaine and tobacco. Those, I think, were the main<br/>points of my analysis."<br/>
