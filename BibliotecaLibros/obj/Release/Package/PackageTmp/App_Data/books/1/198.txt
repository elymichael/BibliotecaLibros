"We have known for some time that a clever gang was at work,"
said the inspector. "They have been turning out half-crowns by the

and the whole place is in a blaze."

"Whose house is it?"

"Dr. Becher's."

"Tell me," broke in the engineer, "is Dr. Becher a German, very
thin, with a long, sharp nose?"
