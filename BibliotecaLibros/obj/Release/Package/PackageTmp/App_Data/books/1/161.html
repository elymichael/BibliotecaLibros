"'Very likely. And yet if it were on the lawn, I wonder that you<br/>did not hear it also.'<br/><br/>"'Ah, but I sleep more heavily than you.'<br/><br/>"'Well, it is of no great consequence, at any rate.' She smiled<br/>back at me, closed my door, and a few moments later I heard her key<br/>turn in the lock."<br/><br/>"Indeed," said Holmes. "Was it your custom always to lock<br/>yourselves in at night?"<br/><br/>"Always."<br/><br/>"And why?"<br/><br/>"I think that I mentioned to you that the doctor kept a cheetah<br/>and a baboon. We had no feeling of security unless our doors were<br/>locked."<br/><br/>"Quite so. Pray proceed with your statement."<br/><br/>"I could not sleep that night. A vague feeling of impending<br/>misfortune impressed me. My sister and I, you will recollect, were<br/>twins, and you know how subtle are the links which bind two souls<br/>which are so closely allied. It was a wild night. The wind was<br/>howling outside, and the rain was beating and splashing against the<br/>windows. Suddenly, amid all the hubbub of the gale, there burst<br/>forth the wild scream of a terrified woman. I knew that it was my<br/>sister's voice. I sprang from my bed, wrapped a shawl round me, and<br/>rushed into the corridor. As I opened my door I seemed to hear a<br/>low whistle, such as my sister described, and a few moments later a<br/>clanging sound, as if a mass of metal had fallen. As I ran down the<br/>passage, my sister's door was unlocked, and revolved slowly upon<br/>its hinges. I stared at it horror-stricken, not knowing what was<br/>about to issue from it. By the light of the corridor-lamp I saw my<br/>sister appear at the opening, her face blanched with terror, her<br/>hands groping for help, her whole figure swaying to and fro like<br/>that of a drunkard. I ran to her and threw my arms round her, but<br/>at that moment her knees seemed to give way and she fell to the<br/>ground. She writhed as one who is in terrible pain, and her limbs<br/>were dreadfully convulsed. At first I thought that she had not<br/>recognised me, but as I bent over her she suddenly shrieked out in<br/>a voice which I shall never forget, 'Oh, my God! Helen! It was the<br/>band! The speckled band!' There was something else which she would<br/>fain have said, and she stabbed with her finger into the air in the<br/>direction of the doctor's room, but a fresh convulsion seized her<br/>and choked her words. I rushed out, calling loudly for my<br/>stepfather, and I met him hastening from his room in his<br/>dressing-gown. When he reached my sister's side she was<br/>unconscious, and though he poured brandy down her throat and sent<br/>for medical aid from the village, all efforts were in vain, for she<br/>slowly sank and died without having recovered her consciousness.<br/>Such was the dreadful end of my beloved sister."<br/><br/>"One moment," said Holmes, "are you sure about this whistle and<br/>metallic sound? Could you swear to it?"<br/><br/>"That was what the county coroner asked me at the inquiry. It is<br/>my strong impression that I heard it, and yet, among the crash of<br/>the gale and the creaking of an old house, I may possibly have been<br/>deceived."<br/>
