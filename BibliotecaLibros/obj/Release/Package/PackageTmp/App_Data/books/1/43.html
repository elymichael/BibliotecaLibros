<br/>DISSOLVED.<br/><br/>October 9, 1890.<br/><br/>Sherlock Holmes and I surveyed this curt announcement and the<br/>rueful face behind it, until the comical side of the affair so<br/>completely overtopped every other consideration that we both burst<br/>out into a roar of laughter.<br/><br/>"I cannot see that there is anything very funny," cried our<br/>client, flushing up to the roots of his flaming head. "If you can<br/>do nothing better than laugh at me, I can go elsewhere."<br/><br/>"No, no," cried Holmes, shoving him back into the chair from<br/>which he had half risen. "I really wouldn't miss your case for the<br/>world. It is most refreshingly unusual. But there is, if you will<br/>excuse my saying so, something just a little funny about it. Pray<br/>what steps did you take when you found the card upon the door?"<br/><br/>"I was staggered, sir. I did not know what to do. Then I called<br/>at the offices round, but none of them seemed to know anything<br/>about it. Finally, I went to the landlord, who is an accountant<br/>living on the ground-floor, and I asked him if he could tell me<br/>what had become of the Red-headed League. He said that he had never<br/>heard of any such body. Then I asked him who Mr. Duncan Ross was.<br/>He answered that the name was new to him.<br/><br/>"'Well,' said I, 'the gentleman at No. 4.'<br/><br/>"'What, the red-headed man?'<br/><br/>"'Yes.'<br/><br/>"'Oh,' said he, 'his name was William Morris. He was a solicitor<br/>and was using my room as a temporary convenience until his new<br/>premises were ready. He moved out yesterday.'<br/><br/>
