"'Only that?' said he, looking at me keenly.<br/><br/>"'Why, what did you think?' I asked.<br/><br/>"'Why do you think that I lock this door?'<br/><br/>"'I am sure that I do not know.'<br/><br/>"'It is to keep people out who have no business there. Do you<br/>see?' He was still smiling in the most amiable manner.<br/><br/>"'I am sure if I had known—'<br/><br/>"'Well, then, you know now. And if you ever put your foot over<br/>that threshold again'—here in an instant the smile hardened into a<br/>grin of rage, and he glared down at me with the face of a<br/>demon—'I'll throw you to the mastiff.'<br/><br/>"I was so terrified that I do not know what I did. I suppose<br/>that I must have rushed past him into my room. I remember nothing<br/>until I found myself lying on my bed trembling all over. Then I<br/>thought of you, Mr. Holmes. I could not live there longer without<br/>some advice. I was frightened of the house, of the man, of the<br/>woman, of the servants, even of the child. They were all horrible<br/>to me. If I could only bring you down all would be well. Of course<br/>I might have fled from the house, but my curiosity was almost as<br/>strong as my fears. My mind was soon made up. I would send you a<br/>wire. I put on my hat and cloak, went down to the office, which is<br/>about half a mile from the house, and then returned, feeling very<br/>much easier. A horrible doubt came into my mind as I approached the<br/>door lest the dog might be loose, but I remembered that Toller had<br/>drunk himself into a state of insensibility that evening, and I<br/>knew that he was the only one in the household who had any<br/>influence with the savage creature, or who would venture to set him<br/>free. I slipped in in safety and lay awake half the night in my joy<br/>at the thought of seeing you. I had no difficulty in getting leave<br/>to come into Winchester this morning, but I must be back before<br/>three o'clock, for Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle are going on a visit, and<br/>will be away all the evening, so that I must look after the child.<br/>Now I have told you all my adventures, Mr. Holmes, and I should be<br/>very glad if you could tell me what it all means, and, above all,<br/>what I should do."<br/><br/>Holmes and I had listened spellbound to this extraordinary<br/>story. My friend rose now and paced up and down the room, his hands<br/>in his pockets, and an expression of the most profound gravity upon<br/>his face.<br/><br/>"Is Toller still drunk?" he asked.<br/><br/>"Yes. I heard his wife tell Mrs. Rucastle that she could do<br/>nothing with him."<br/>
