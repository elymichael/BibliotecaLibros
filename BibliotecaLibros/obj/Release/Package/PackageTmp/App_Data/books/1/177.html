"Well, there is at least a curious coincidence of dates. A<br/>ventilator is made, a cord is hung, and a lady who sleeps in the<br/>bed dies. Does not that strike you?"<br/><br/>"I cannot as yet see any connection."<br/><br/>"Did you observe anything very peculiar about that bed?"<br/><br/>"No."<br/><br/>"It was clamped to the floor. Did you ever see a bed fastened<br/>like that before?"<br/><br/>"I cannot say that I have."<br/><br/>"The lady could not move her bed.

But we shall have horrors enough before the<br/>night is over; for goodness' sake let us have a quiet pipe and turn<br/>our minds for a few hours to something more cheerful."<br/><br/>About nine o'clock the light among the trees was extinguished,<br/>and all was dark in the direction of the Manor House. Two hours<br/>passed slowly away, and then, suddenly, just at the stroke of<br/>eleven, a single bright light shone out right in front of us.<br/><br/>"That is our signal," said Holmes, springing to his feet; "it<br/>comes from the middle window."<br/>
