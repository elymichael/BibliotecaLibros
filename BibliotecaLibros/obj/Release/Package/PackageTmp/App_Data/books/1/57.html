<br/>"Some ten or twelve, but none which present any feature of<br/>interest. They are important, you understand, without being<br/>interesting. Indeed, I have found that it is usually in unimportant<br/>matters that there is a field for the observation, and for the<br/>quick analysis of cause and effect which gives the charm to an<br/>investigation. The larger crimes are apt to be the simpler, for the<br/>bigger the crime the more obvious, as a rule, is the motive. In<br/>these cases, save for one rather intricate matter which has been<br/>referred to me from Marseilles, there is nothing which presents any<br/>features of interest. It is possible, however, that I may have<br/>something better before very many minutes are over, for this is one<br/>of my clients, or I am much mistaken."<br/><br/>He had risen from his chair and was standing between the parted<br/>blinds gazing down into the dull neutral-tinted London street.<br/>Looking over his shoulder, I saw that on the pavement opposite<br/>there stood a large woman with a heavy fur boa round her neck, and<br/>a large curling red feather in a broad-brimmed hat which was tilted<br/>in a coquettish Duchess of Devonshire fashion over her ear. From<br/>under this great panoply she peeped up in a nervous, hesitating<br/>fashion at our windows, while her body oscillated backward and<br/>forward, and her fingers fidgeted with her glove buttons. Suddenly,<br/>with a plunge, as of the swimmer who leaves the bank, she hurried<br/>across the road, and we heard the sharp clang of the bell.<br/><br/>"I have seen those symptoms before," said Holmes, throwing his<br/>cigarette into the fire. "Oscillation upon the pavement always<br/>means an affaire de coeur. She would like advice, but is not sure<br/>that the matter is not too delicate for communication. And yet even<br/>here we may discriminate. When a woman has been seriously wronged<br/>by a man she no longer oscillates, and the usual symptom is a<br/>broken bell wire. Here we may take it that there is a love matter,<br/>but that the maiden is not so much angry as perplexed, or grieved.<br/>But here she comes in person to resolve our doubts."<br/><br/>As he spoke there was a tap at the door, and the boy in buttons<br/>entered to announce Miss Mary Sutherland, while the lady herself<br/>loomed behind his small black figure like a full-sailed<br/>merchant-man behind a tiny pilot boat. Sherlock Holmes welcomed her<br/>with the easy courtesy for which he was remarkable, and, having<br/>closed the door and bowed her into an armchair, he looked her over<br/>in the minute and yet abstracted fashion which was peculiar to<br/>him.<br/><br/>"Do you not find," he said, "that with your short sight it is a<br/>little trying to do so much typewriting?"<br/><br/>"I did at first," she answered, "but now I know where the<br/>letters are without looking." Then, suddenly realising the full<br/>purport of his words, she gave a violent start and looked up, with<br/>fear and astonishment upon her broad, good-humoured face. "You've<br/>heard about me, Mr. Holmes," she cried, "else how could you know<br/>all that?"<br/><br/>"Never mind," said Holmes, laughing; "it is my business to know<br/>things. Perhaps I have trained myself to see what others overlook.<br/>If not, why should you come to consult me?"<br/><br/>"I came to you, sir, because I heard of you from Mrs. Etherege,<br/>whose husband you found so easy when the police and everyone had<br/>given him up for dead. Oh, Mr. Holmes, I wish you would do as much<br/>for me. I'm not rich, but still I have a hundred a year in my own<br/>right, besides the little that I make by the machine, and I would<br/>give it all to know what has become of Mr. Hosmer Angel."<br/><br/>"Why did you come away to consult me in such a hurry?" asked<br/>Sherlock Holmes, with his finger-tips together and his eyes to the<br/>ceiling.<br/><br/>Again a startled look came over the somewhat vacuous face of<br/>Miss Mary Sutherland. "Yes, I did bang out of the house," she said,<br/>"for it made me angry to see the easy way in which Mr.<br/>Windibank—that is, my father—took it all. He would not go to the<br/>police, and he would not go to you, and so at last, as he would do<br/>nothing and kept on saying that there was no harm done, it made me<br/>mad, and I just on with my things and came right away to you."<br/><br/>
