<br/>"Yes, sir."<br/><br/>"And brought Miss Hunter down from London in order to get rid of<br/>the disagreeable persistence of Mr. Fowler."<br/><br/>"That was it, sir."<br/><br/>"But Mr. Fowler being a persevering man, as a good seaman should<br/>be, blockaded the house, and having met you succeeded by certain<br/>arguments, metallic or otherwise, in convincing you that your<br/>interests were the same as his."<br/><br/>"Mr. Fowler was a very kind-spoken, free-handed gentleman," said<br/>Mrs. Toller serenely.<br/><br/>"And in this way he managed that your good man should have no<br/>want of drink, and that a ladder should be ready at the moment when<br/>your master had gone out."<br/><br/>"You have it, sir, just as it happened."<br/><br/>"I am sure we owe you an apology, Mrs. Toller," said Holmes,<br/>"for you have certainly cleared up everything which puzzled us. And<br/>here comes the country surgeon and Mrs. Rucastle, so I think,<br/>Watson, that we had best escort Miss Hunter back to Winchester, as<br/>it seems to me that our locus standi now is rather a questionable<br/>one."<br/><br/>And thus was solved the mystery of the sinister house with the<br/>copper beeches in front of the door. Mr. Rucastle survived, but was<br/>always a broken man, kept alive solely through the care of his<br/>devoted wife. They still live with their old servants, who probably<br/>know so much of Rucastle's past life that he finds it difficult to<br/>part from them. Mr. Fowler and Miss Rucastle were married, by<br/>special license, in Southampton the day after their flight, and he<br/>is now the holder of a government appointment in the island of<br/>Mauritius. As to Miss Violet Hunter, my friend Holmes, rather to my<br/>disappointment, manifested no further interest in her when once she<br/>had ceased to be the centre of one of his problems, and she is now<br/>the head of a private school at Walsall, where I believe that she<br/>has met with considerable success.<br/><br/><br/><br/>
