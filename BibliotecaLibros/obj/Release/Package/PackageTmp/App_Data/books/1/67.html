<br/>"It is a curious thing," remarked Holmes, "that a typewriter has<br/>really quite as much individuality as a man's handwriting. Unless<br/>they are quite new, no two of them write exactly alike. Some<br/>letters get more worn than others, and some wear only on one side.<br/>Now, you remark in this note of yours, Mr. Windibank, that in every<br/>case there is some little slurring over of the 'e,' and a slight<br/>defect in the tail of the 'r.' There are fourteen other<br/>characteristics, but those are the more obvious."<br/><br/>"We do all our correspondence with this machine at the office,<br/>and no doubt it is a little worn," our visitor answered, glancing<br/>keenly at Holmes with his bright little eyes.<br/><br/>"And now I will show you what is really a very interesting<br/>study, Mr. Windibank," Holmes continued. "I think of writing<br/>another little monograph some of these days on the typewriter and<br/>its relation to crime. It is a subject to which I have devoted some<br/>little attention. I have here four letters which purport to come<br/>from the missing man. They are all typewritten. In each case, not<br/>only are the 'e's' slurred and the 'r's' tailless, but you will<br/>observe, if you care to use my magnifying lens, that the fourteen<br/>other characteristics to which I have alluded are there as<br/>well."<br/><br/>Mr. Windibank sprang out of his chair and picked up his hat. "I<br/>cannot waste time over this sort of fantastic talk, Mr. Holmes," he<br/>said. "If you can catch the man, catch him, and let me know when<br/>you have done it."<br/><br/>"Certainly," said Holmes, stepping over and turning the key in<br/>the door. "I let you know, then, that I have caught him!"<br/><br/>"What! where?" shouted Mr. Windibank, turning white to his lips<br/>and glancing about him like a rat in a trap.<br/><br/>"Oh, it won't do—really it won't," said Holmes suavely. "There<br/>is no possible getting out of it, Mr. Windibank. It is quite too<br/>transparent, and it was a very bad compliment when you said that it<br/>was impossible for me to solve so simple a question. That's right!<br/>Sit down and let us talk it over."<br/><br/>Our visitor collapsed into a chair, with a ghastly face and a<br/>glitter of moisture on his brow. "It—it's not actionable," he<br/>stammered.<br/><br/>"I am very much afraid that it is not. But between ourselves,<br/>Windibank, it was as cruel and selfish and heartless a trick in a<br/>petty way as ever came before me. Now, let me just run over the<br/>course of events, and you will contradict me if I go wrong."<br/><br/>The man sat huddled up in his chair, with his head sunk upon his<br/>breast, like one who is utterly crushed. Holmes stuck his feet up<br/>on the corner of the mantelpiece and, leaning back with his hands<br/>in his pockets, began talking, rather to himself, as it seemed,<br/>than to us.<br/><br/>
