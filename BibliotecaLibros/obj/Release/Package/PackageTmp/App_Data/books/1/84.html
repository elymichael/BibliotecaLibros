<br/>It was about ten minutes before we regained our cab and drove<br/>back into Ross, Holmes still carrying with him the stone which he<br/>had picked up in the wood.<br/><br/>"This may interest you, Lestrade," he remarked, holding it out.<br/>"The murder was done with it."<br/><br/>"I see no marks."<br/><br/>"There are none."<br/><br/>"How do you know, then?"<br/><br/>"The grass was growing under it. It had only lain there a few<br/>days. There was no sign of a place whence it had been taken. It<br/>corresponds with the injuries. There is no sign of any other<br/>weapon."<br/><br/>"And the murderer?"<br/><br/>"Is a tall man, left-handed, limps with the right leg, wears<br/>thick-soled shooting-boots and a grey cloak, smokes Indian cigars,<br/>uses a cigar-holder, and carries a blunt pen-knife in his pocket.<br/>There are several other indications, but these may be enough to aid<br/>us in our search."<br/><br/>Lestrade laughed. "I am afraid that I am still a sceptic," he<br/>said. "Theories are all very well, but we have to deal with a<br/>hard-headed British jury."<br/><br/>"Nous verrons," answered Holmes calmly. "You work your own<br/>method, and I shall work mine. I shall be busy this afternoon, and<br/>shall probably return to London by the evening train."<br/><br/>
