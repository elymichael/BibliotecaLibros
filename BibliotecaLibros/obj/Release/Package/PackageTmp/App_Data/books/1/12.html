<br/>"The facts are briefly these: Some five years ago, during a<br/>lengthy visit to Warsaw, I made the acquaintance of the well-known<br/>adventuress, Irene Adler. The name is no doubt familiar to<br/>you."<br/><br/>"Kindly look her up in my index, Doctor," murmured Holmes<br/>without opening his eyes. For many years he had adopted a system of<br/>docketing all paragraphs concerning men and things, so that it was<br/>difficult to name a subject or a person on which he could not at<br/>once furnish information. In this case I found her biography<br/>sandwiched in between that of a Hebrew rabbi and that of a<br/>staff-commander who had written a monograph upon the deep-sea<br/>fishes.<br/><br/>"Let me see!" said Holmes. "Hum! Born in New Jersey in the year<br/>1858. Contralto—hum! La Scala, hum! Prima donna Imperial Opera of<br/>Warsaw—yes! Retired from operatic stage—ha! Living in London—quite<br/>so! Your Majesty, as I understand, became entangled with this young<br/>person, wrote her some compromising letters, and is now desirous of<br/>getting those letters back."<br/><br/>"Precisely so. But how—"<br/><br/>"Was there a secret marriage?"<br/><br/>"None."<br/><br/>"No legal papers or certificates?"<br/><br/>"None."<br/><br/>"Then I fail to follow your Majesty. If this young person should<br/>produce her letters for blackmailing or other purposes, how is she<br/>to prove their authenticity?"<br/><br/>"There is the writing."<br/><br/>
