"'The firm does so when the security is good.' I answered.<br/><br/>"'It is absolutely essential to me,' said he, 'that I should<br/>have 50,000 pounds at once. I could, of course, borrow so trifling<br/>a sum ten times over from my friends, but I much prefer to make it<br/>a matter of business and to carry out that business myself. In my<br/>position you can readily understand that it is unwise to place<br/>one's self under obligations.'<br/><br/>"'For how long, may I ask, do you want this sum?'
