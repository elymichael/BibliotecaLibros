<br/><br/><br/>"To the man who loves art for its own sake," remarked Sherlock<br/>Holmes, tossing aside the advertisement sheet of the Daily<br/>Telegraph, "it is frequently in its least important and lowliest<br/>manifestations that the keenest pleasure is to be derived. It is<br/>pleasant to me to observe, Watson, that you have so far grasped<br/>this truth that in these little records of our cases which you have<br/>been good enough to draw up, and, I am bound to say, occasionally<br/>to embellish, you have given prominence not so much to the many<br/>causes célèbres and sensational trials in which I have figured but<br/>rather to those incidents which may have been trivial in<br/>themselves, but which have given room for those faculties of<br/>deduction and of logical synthesis which I have made my special<br/>province."<br/><br/>"And yet," said I, smiling, "I cannot quite hold myself absolved<br/>from the charge of sensationalism which has been urged against my<br/>records."<br/><br/>"You have erred, perhaps," he observed, taking up a glowing<br/>cinder with the tongs and lighting with it the long cherry-wood<br/>pipe which was wont to replace his clay when he was in a<br/>disputatious rather than a meditative mood—"you have erred perhaps<br/>in attempting to put colour and life into each of your statements<br/>instead of confining yourself to the task of placing upon record<br/>that severe reasoning from cause to effect which is really the only<br/>notable feature about the thing."<br/><br/>"It seems to me that I have done you full justice in the<br/>matter," I remarked with some coldness, for I was repelled by the<br/>egotism which I had more than once observed to be a strong factor<br/>in my friend's singular character.<br/><br/>"No, it is not selfishness or conceit," said he, answering, as<br/>was his wont, my thoughts rather than my words. "If I claim full<br/>justice for my art, it is because it is an impersonal thing—a thing<br/>beyond myself. Crime is common. Logic is rare. Therefore it is upon<br/>the logic rather than upon the crime that you should dwell. You<br/>have degraded what should have been a course of lectures into a<br/>series of tales."<br/><br/>It was a cold morning of the early spring, and we sat after<br/>breakfast on either side of a cheery fire in the old room at Baker<br/>Street. A thick fog rolled down between the lines of dun-coloured<br/>houses, and the opposing windows loomed like dark, shapeless blurs<br/>through the heavy yellow wreaths. Our gas was lit and shone on the<br/>white cloth and glimmer of china and metal, for the table had not<br/>been cleared yet. Sherlock Holmes had been silent all the morning,<br/>dipping continuously into the advertisement columns of a succession<br/>of papers until at last, having apparently given up his search, he<br/>had emerged in no very sweet temper to lecture me upon my literary<br/>shortcomings.<br/><br/>"At the same time," he remarked after a pause, during which he<br/>had sat puffing at his long pipe and gazing down into the fire,<br/>"you can hardly be open to a charge of sensationalism, for out of<br/>these cases which you have been so kind as to interest yourself in,<br/>a fair proportion do not treat of crime, in its legal sense, at<br/>all. The small matter in which I endeavoured to help the King of<br/>Bohemia, the singular experience of Miss Mary Sutherland, the<br/>problem connected with the man with the twisted lip, and the<br/>incident of the noble bachelor, were all matters which are outside<br/>the pale of the law. But in avoiding the sensational, I fear that<br/>you may have bordered on the trivial."<br/><br/>"The end may have been so," I answered, "but the methods I hold<br/>to have been novel and of interest."<br/><br/>"Pshaw, my dear fellow, what do the public, the great<br/>unobservant public, who could hardly tell a weaver by his tooth or<br/>a compositor by his left thumb, care about the finer shades of<br/>analysis and deduction! But, indeed, if you are trivial. I cannot<br/>blame you, for the days of the great cases are past. Man, or at<br/>least criminal man, has lost all enterprise and originality. As to<br/>my own little practice, it seems to be degenerating into an agency<br/>for recovering lost lead pencils and giving advice to young ladies<br/>from boarding-schools. I think that I have touched bottom at last,<br/>however. This note I had this morning marks my zero-point, I fancy.<br/>Read it!" He tossed a crumpled letter across to me.<br/><br/>It was dated from Montague Place upon the preceding evening, and<br/>ran thus:<br/>
