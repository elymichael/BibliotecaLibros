"Ay, bodies, Watson. We should be rich men if we had 1000 pounds<br/>for every poor devil who has been done to death in that den. It is<br/>the vilest murder-trap on the whole riverside, and I fear that<br/>Neville St. Clair has entered it never to leave it more. But our<br/>trap should be here." He put his two forefingers between his teeth<br/>and whistled shrillyâ€”a signal which was answered by a similar<br/>whistle from the distance, followed shortly by the rattle of wheels<br/>and the clink of horses' hoofs.<br/><br/>"Now, Watson," said Holmes, as a tall dog-cart dashed up through<br/>the gloom, throwing out two golden tunnels of yellow light from its<br/>side lanterns. "You'll come with me, won't you?"<br/><br/>"If I can be of use."<br/><br/>"Oh, a trusty comrade is always of use; and a chronicler still<br/>more so. My room at The Cedars is a double-bedded one."<br/><br/>"The Cedars?"<br/><br/>"Yes; that is Mr. St. Clair's house. I am staying there while I<br/>conduct the inquiry."<br/><br/>"Where is it, then?"<br/><br/>"Near Lee, in Kent. We have a seven-mile drive before us."<br/><br/>"But I am all in the dark."<br/><br/>"Of course you are. You'll know all about it presently. Jump up<br/>here. All right, John; we shall not need you. Here's half a crown.<br/>Look out for me to-morrow, about eleven. Give her her head. So<br/>long, then!"<br/><br/>He flicked the horse with his whip, and we dashed away through<br/>the endless succession of sombre and deserted streets, which<br/>widened gradually, until we were flying across a broad balustraded<br/>bridge, with the murky river flowing sluggishly beneath us. Beyond<br/>lay another dull wilderness of bricks and mortar, its silence<br/>broken only by the heavy, regular footfall of the policeman, or the<br/>songs and shouts of some belated party of revellers. A dull wrack<br/>was drifting slowly across the sky, and a star or two twinkled<br/>dimly here and there through the rifts of the clouds. Holmes drove<br/>in silence, with his head sunk upon his breast, and the air of a<br/>man who is lost in thought, while I sat beside him, curious to<br/>learn what this new quest might be which seemed to tax his powers<br/>so sorely, and yet afraid to break in upon the current of his<br/>thoughts. We had driven several miles, and were beginning to get to<br/>the fringe of the belt of suburban villas, when he shook himself,<br/>shrugged his shoulders, and lit up his pipe with the air of a man<br/>who has satisfied himself that he is acting for the best.<br/>
