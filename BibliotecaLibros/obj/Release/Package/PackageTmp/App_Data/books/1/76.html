<br/>"A Juryman: Did you see nothing which aroused your suspicions<br/>when you returned on hearing the cry and found your father fatally<br/>injured?<br/><br/>"Witness: Nothing definite.<br/><br/>"The Coroner: What do you mean?<br/><br/>"Witness: I was so disturbed and excited as I rushed out into<br/>the open, that I could think of nothing except of my father. Yet I<br/>have a vague impression that as I ran forward something lay upon<br/>the ground to the left of me. It seemed to me to be something grey<br/>in colour, a coat of some sort, or a plaid perhaps. When I rose<br/>from my father I looked round for it, but it was gone.<br/><br/>"'Do you mean that it disappeared before you went for help?'<br/><br/>"'Yes, it was gone.'<br/><br/>"'You cannot say what it was?'<br/><br/>"'No, I had a feeling something was there.'<br/><br/>"'How far from the body?'<br/><br/>"'A dozen yards or so.'<br/><br/>
