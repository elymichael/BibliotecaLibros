<br/>"But his lameness?"<br/><br/>"The impression of his right foot was always less distinct than<br/>his left. He put less weight upon it. Why? Because he limped—he was<br/>lame."<br/><br/>"But his left-handedness."<br/><br/>"You were yourself struck by the nature of the injury as<br/>recorded by the surgeon at the inquest. The blow was struck from<br/>immediately behind, and yet was upon the left side. Now, how can<br/>that be unless it were by a left-handed man? He had stood behind<br/>that tree during the interview between the father and son. He had<br/>even smoked there. I found the ash of a cigar, which my special<br/>knowledge of tobacco ashes enables me to pronounce as an Indian<br/>cigar. I have, as you know, devoted some attention to this, and<br/>written a little monograph on the ashes of 140 different varieties<br/>of pipe, cigar, and cigarette tobacco. Having found the ash, I then<br/>looked round and discovered the stump among the moss where he had<br/>tossed it. It was an Indian cigar, of the variety which are rolled<br/>in Rotterdam."<br/><br/>"And the cigar-holder?"<br/><br/>"I could see that the end had not been in his mouth.

I see<br/>the direction in which all this points. The culprit is—"<br/><br/>"Mr. John Turner," cried the hotel waiter, opening the door of<br/>our sitting-room, and ushering in a visitor.<br/><br/>The man who entered was a strange and impressive figure. His<br/>slow, limping step and bowed shoulders gave the appearance of<br/>decrepitude, and yet his hard, deep-lined, craggy features, and his<br/>enormous limbs showed that he was possessed of unusual strength of<br/>body and of character. His tangled beard, grizzled hair, and<br/>outstanding, drooping eyebrows combined to give an air of dignity<br/>and power to his appearance, but his face was of an ashen white,<br/>while his lips and the corners of his nostrils were tinged with a<br/>shade of blue. It was clear to me at a glance that he was in the<br/>grip of some deadly and chronic disease.<br/><br/>"Pray sit down on the sofa," said Holmes gently. "You had my<br/>note?"<br/><br/>
