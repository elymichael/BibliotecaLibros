<br/>"Then perhaps you will kindly explain how it is that we found<br/>this in it?" He opened his bag as he spoke, and tumbled onto the<br/>floor a wedding-dress of watered silk, a pair of white satin shoes<br/>and a bride's wreath and veil, all discoloured and soaked in water.<br/>"There," said he, putting a new wedding-ring upon the top of the<br/>pile. "There is a little nut for you to crack, Master Holmes."<br/><br/>"Oh, indeed!" said my friend, blowing blue rings into the air.<br/>"You dragged them from the Serpentine?"<br/><br/>"No. They were found floating near the margin by a park-keeper.<br/>They have been identified as her clothes, and it seemed to me that<br/>if the clothes were there the body would not be far off."<br/><br/>"By the same brilliant reasoning, every man's body is to be<br/>found in the neighbourhood of his wardrobe. And pray what did you<br/>hope to arrive at through this?"<br/><br/>"At some evidence implicating Flora Millar in the<br/>disappearance."<br/><br/>"I am afraid that you will find it difficult."<br/><br/>"Are you, indeed, now?" cried Lestrade with some bitterness. "I<br/>am afraid, Holmes, that you are not very practical with your<br/>deductions and your inferences. You have made two blunders in as<br/>many minutes. This dress does implicate Miss Flora Millar."<br/><br/>"And how?"<br/><br/>"In the dress is a pocket. In the pocket is a card-case. In the<br/>card-case is a note. And here is the very note." He slapped it down<br/>upon the table in front of him. "Listen to this: 'You will see me<br/>when all is ready. Come at once. F.H.M.' Now my theory all along<br/>has been that Lady St. Simon was decoyed away by Flora Millar, and<br/>that she, with confederates, no doubt, was responsible for her<br/>disappearance. Here, signed with her initials, is the very note<br/>which was no doubt quietly slipped into her hand at the door and<br/>which lured her within their reach."<br/><br/>"Very good, Lestrade," said Holmes, laughing. "You really are<br/>very fine indeed. Let me see it." He took up the paper in a<br/>listless way, but his attention instantly became riveted, and he<br/>gave a little cry of satisfaction. "This is indeed important," said<br/>he.<br/><br/>
