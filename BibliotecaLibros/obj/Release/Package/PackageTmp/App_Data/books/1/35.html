<br/>"A proposition which I took the liberty of doubting."<br/><br/>"You did, Doctor, but none the less you must come round to my<br/>view, for otherwise I shall keep on piling fact upon fact on you<br/>until your reason breaks down under them and acknowledges me to be<br/>right. Now, Mr. Jabez Wilson here has been good enough to call upon<br/>me this morning, and to begin a narrative which promises to be one<br/>of the most singular which I have listened to for some time. You<br/>have heard me remark that the strangest and most unique things are<br/>very often connected not with the larger but with the smaller<br/>crimes, and occasionally, indeed, where there is room for doubt<br/>whether any positive crime has been committed. As far as I have<br/>heard it is impossible for me to say whether the present case is an<br/>instance of crime or not, but the course of events is certainly<br/>among the most singular that I have ever listened to. Perhaps, Mr.<br/>Wilson, you would have the great kindness to recommence your<br/>narrative. I ask you not merely because my friend Dr. Watson has<br/>not heard the opening part but also because the peculiar nature of<br/>the story makes me anxious to have every possible detail from your<br/>lips. As a rule, when I have heard some slight indication of the<br/>course of events, I am able to guide myself by the thousands of<br/>other similar cases which occur to my memory. In the present<br/>instance I am forced to admit that the facts are, to the best of my<br/>belief, unique."<br/><br/>The portly client puffed out his chest with an appearance of<br/>some little pride and pulled a dirty and wrinkled newspaper from<br/>the inside pocket of his greatcoat. As he glanced down the<br/>advertisement column, with his head thrust forward and the paper<br/>flattened out upon his knee, I took a good look at the man and<br/>endeavoured, after the fashion of my companion, to read the<br/>indications which might be presented by his dress or<br/>appearance.<br/><br/>I did not gain very much, however, by my inspection. Our visitor<br/>bore every mark of being an average commonplace British tradesman,<br/>obese, pompous, and slow. He wore rather baggy grey shepherd's<br/>check trousers, a not over-clean black frock-coat, unbuttoned in<br/>the front, and a drab waistcoat with a heavy brassy Albert chain,<br/>and a square pierced bit of metal dangling down as an ornament. A<br/>frayed top-hat and a faded brown overcoat with a wrinkled velvet<br/>collar lay upon a chair beside him. Altogether, look as I would,<br/>there was nothing remarkable about the man save his blazing red<br/>head, and the expression of extreme chagrin and discontent upon his<br/>features.<br/><br/>Sherlock Holmes' quick eye took in my occupation, and he shook<br/>his head with a smile as he noticed my questioning glances. "Beyond<br/>the obvious facts that he has at some time done manual labour, that<br/>he takes snuff, that he is a Freemason, that he has been in China,<br/>and that he has done a considerable amount of writing lately, I can<br/>deduce nothing else."<br/><br/>Mr. Jabez Wilson started up in his chair, with his forefinger<br/>upon the paper, but his eyes upon my companion.<br/><br/>"How, in the name of good-fortune, did you know all that, Mr.<br/>Holmes?" he asked. "How did you know, for example, that I did<br/>manual labour. It's as true as gospel, for I began as a ship's<br/>carpenter."<br/><br/>"Your hands, my dear sir. Your right hand is quite a size larger<br/>than your left. You have worked with it, and the muscles are more<br/>developed."<br/><br/>"Well, the snuff, then, and the Freemasonry?"<br/><br/>"I won't insult your intelligence by telling you how I read<br/>that, especially as, rather against the strict rules of your order,<br/>you use an arc-and-compass breastpin."<br/><br/>
