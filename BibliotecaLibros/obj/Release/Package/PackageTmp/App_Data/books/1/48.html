"What then?"<br/><br/>"The knees of his trousers."<br/><br/>"And what did you see?"<br/><br/>"What I expected to see."<br/><br/>"Why did you beat the pavement?"<br/><br/>"My dear doctor, this is a time for observation, not for talk.<br/>We are spies in an enemy's country. We know something of<br/>Saxe-Coburg Square. Let us now explore the parts which lie behind<br/>it."<br/><br/>The road in which we found ourselves as we turned round the<br/>corner from the retired Saxe-Coburg Square presented as great a<br/>contrast to it as the front of a picture does to the back. It was<br/>one of the main arteries which conveyed the traffic of the City to<br/>the north and west. The roadway was blocked with the immense stream<br/>of commerce flowing in a double tide inward and outward, while the<br/>footpaths were black with the hurrying swarm of pedestrians. It was<br/>difficult to realise as we looked at the line of fine shops and<br/>stately business premises that they really abutted on the other<br/>side upon the faded and stagnant square which we had just<br/>quitted.<br/><br/>"Let me see," said Holmes, standing at the corner and glancing<br/>along the line, "I should like just to remember the order of the<br/>houses here. It is a hobby of mine to have an exact knowledge of<br/>London. There is Mortimer's, the tobacconist, the little newspaper<br/>shop, the Coburg branch of the City and Suburban Bank, the<br/>Vegetarian Restaurant, and McFarlane's carriage-building depot.<br/>That carries us right on to the other block. And now, Doctor, we've<br/>done our work, so it's time we had some play. A sandwich and a cup<br/>of coffee, and then off to violin-land, where all is sweetness and<br/>delicacy and harmony, and there are no red-headed clients to vex us<br/>with their conundrums."<br/><br/>My friend was an enthusiastic musician, being himself not only a<br/>very capable performer but a composer of no ordinary merit. All the<br/>afternoon he sat in the stalls wrapped in the most perfect<br/>happiness, gently waving his long, thin fingers in time to the<br/>music, while his gently smiling face and his languid, dreamy eyes<br/>were as unlike those of Holmes the sleuth-hound, Holmes the<br/>relentless, keen-witted, ready-handed criminal agent, as it was<br/>possible to conceive. In his singular character the dual nature<br/>alternately asserted itself, and his extreme exactness and<br/>astuteness represented, as I have often thought, the reaction<br/>against the poetic and contemplative mood which occasionally<br/>predominated in him. The swing of his nature took him from extreme<br/>languor to devouring energy; and, as I knew well, he was never so<br/>truly formidable as when, for days on end, he had been lounging in<br/>his armchair amid his improvisations and his black-letter editions.<br/>Then it was that the lust of the chase would suddenly come upon<br/>him, and that his brilliant reasoning power would rise to the level<br/>of intuition, until those who were unacquainted with his methods<br/>would look askance at him as on a man whose knowledge was not that<br/>of other mortals. When I saw him that afternoon so enwrapped in the<br/>music at St. James's Hall I felt that an evil time might be coming<br/>upon those whom he had set himself to hunt down.<br/><br/>"You want to go home, no doubt, Doctor," he remarked as we<br/>emerged.<br/><br/>"Yes, it would be as well."<br/>
