"'I am afraid that it is quite essential,' said he. 'It is a
little fancy of my wife's, and ladies' fancies, you know, madam,
ladies' fancies must be consulted. And so you won't cut your
hair?'

"'No, sir, I really could not,' I answered firmly.

"'Ah, very well; then that quite settles the matter. It is a
pity, because in other respects you would really have done very
nicely. In that case, Miss Stoper, I had best inspect a few more of
your young ladies.'

"The manageress had sat all this while busy with her papers
without a word to either of us, but she glanced at me now with so
much annoyance upon her face that I could not help suspecting that
she had lost a handsome commission through my refusal.

"'Do you desire your name to be kept upon the books?' she
asked.

"'If you please, Miss Stoper.'

"'Well, really, it seems rather useless, since you refuse the
most excellent offers in this fashion,' said she sharply. 'You can
hardly expect us to exert ourselves to find another such opening
for you. Good-day to you, Miss Hunter.' She struck a gong upon the
table, and I was shown out by the page.

"Well, Mr. Holmes, when I got back to my lodgings and found
little enough in the cupboard, and two or three bills upon the
table. I began to ask myself whether I had not done a very foolish
thing. After all, if these people had strange fads and expected
obedience on the most extraordinary matters, they were at least
ready to pay for their eccentricity. Very few governesses in
England are getting 100 pounds a year. Besides, what use was my
hair to me? Many people are improved by wearing it short and
perhaps I should be among the number. Next day I was inclined to
think that I had made a mistake, and by the day after I was sure of
it. I had almost overcome my pride so far as to go back to the
agency and inquire whether the place was still open when I received
this letter from the gentleman himself. I have it here and I will
read it to you:

"'The Copper Beeches, near Winchester. "'DEAR MISS HUNTER:â€”Miss
Stoper has very kindly given me your address, and I write from here
to ask you whether you have reconsidered your decision. My wife is
very anxious that you should come, for she has been much attracted
by my description of you. We are willing to give 30 pounds a
quarter, or 120 pounds a year, so as to recompense you for any
little inconvenience which our fads may cause you. They are not
very exacting, after all. My wife is fond of a particular shade of
electric blue and would like you to wear such a dress indoors in
the morning. You need not, however, go to the expense of purchasing
one, as we have one belonging to my dear daughter Alice (now in
Philadelphia), which would, I should think, fit you very well.
Then, as to sitting here or there, or amusing yourself in any
manner indicated, that need cause you no inconvenience. As regards
your hair, it is no doubt a pity, especially as I could not help
remarking its beauty during our short interview, but I am afraid
that I must remain firm upon this point, and I only hope that the
increased salary may recompense you for the loss. Your duties, as
far as the child is concerned, are very light. Now do try to come,
and I shall meet you with the dog-cart at Winchester. Let me know
your train. Yours faithfully, JEPHRO RUCASTLE.'

"That is the letter which I have just received, Mr. Holmes, and
my mind is made up that I will accept it. I thought, however, that
before taking the final step I should like to submit the whole
matter to your consideration."
