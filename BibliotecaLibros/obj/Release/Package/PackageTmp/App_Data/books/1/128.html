"It has been in some points a singular case," said Holmes,<br/>flicking the horse on into a gallop. "I confess that I have been as<br/>blind as a mole, but it is better to learn wisdom late than never<br/>to learn it at all."<br/><br/>In town the earliest risers were just beginning to look sleepily<br/>from their windows as we drove through the streets of the Surrey<br/>side. Passing down the Waterloo Bridge Road we crossed over the<br/>river, and dashing up Wellington Street wheeled sharply to the<br/>right and found ourselves in Bow Street. Sherlock Holmes was well<br/>known to the force, and the two constables at the door saluted him.<br/>One of them held the horse's head while the other led us in.<br/><br/>"Who is on duty?" asked Holmes.<br/><br/>"Inspector Bradstreet, sir."<br/><br/>"Ah, Bradstreet, how are you?" A tall, stout official had come<br/>down the stone-flagged passage, in a peaked cap and frogged jacket.<br/>"I wish to have a quiet word with you, Bradstreet." "Certainly, Mr.<br/>Holmes. Step into my room here." It was a small, office-like room,<br/>with a huge ledger upon the table, and a telephone projecting from<br/>the wall. The inspector sat down at his desk.<br/><br/>"What can I do for you, Mr. Holmes?"<br/><br/>"I called about that beggarman, Booneâ€”the one who was charged<br/>with being concerned in the disappearance of Mr. Neville St. Clair,<br/>of Lee."<br/><br/>"Yes. He was brought up and remanded for further inquiries."<br/><br/>"So I heard. You have him here?"<br/><br/>"In the cells."<br/><br/>"Is he quiet?"<br/>
