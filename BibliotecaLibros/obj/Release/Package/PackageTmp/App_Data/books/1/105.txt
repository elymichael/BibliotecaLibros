"More than that. It is probable. And now you see the deadly
urgency of this new case, and why I urged young Openshaw to
caution. The blow has always fallen at the end of the time which it
would take the senders to travel the distance. But this one comes
from London, and therefore we cannot count upon delay."

"Good God!" I cried. "What can it mean, this relentless
persecution?"

"The papers which Openshaw carried are obviously of vital
importance to the person or persons in the sailing-ship. I think
that it is quite clear that there must be more than one of them. A
single man could not have carried out two deaths in such a way as
to deceive a coroner's jury. There must have been several in it,
and they must have been men of resource and determination. Their
papers they mean to have, be the holder of them who it may. In this
way you see K. K. K. ceases to be the initials of an individual and
becomes the badge of a society."

"But of what society?"

"Have you never—" said Sherlock Holmes, bending forward and
sinking his voice—"have you never heard of the Ku Klux Klan?"

"I never have."

Holmes turned over the leaves of the book upon his knee. "Here
it is," said he presently:

"'Ku Klux Klan. A name derived from the fanciful resemblance to
the sound produced by cocking a rifle. This terrible secret society
was formed by some ex-Confederate soldiers in the Southern states
after the Civil War, and it rapidly formed local branches in
different parts of the country, notably in Tennessee, Louisiana,
the Carolinas, Georgia, and Florida. Its power was used for
political purposes, principally for the terrorising of the negro
voters and the murdering and driving from the country of those who
were opposed to its views. Its outrages were usually preceded by a
warning sent to the marked man in some fantastic but generally
recognised shape—a sprig of oak-leaves in some parts, melon seeds
or orange pips in others. On receiving this the victim might either
openly abjure his former ways, or might fly from the country. If he
braved the matter out, death would unfailingly come upon him, and
usually in some strange and unforeseen manner. So perfect was the
organisation of the society, and so systematic its methods, that
there is hardly a case upon record where any man succeeded in
braving it with impunity, or in which any of its outrages were
traced home to the perpetrators. For some years the organisation
flourished in spite of the efforts of the United States government
and of the better classes of the community in the South.
Eventually, in the year 1869, the movement rather suddenly
collapsed, although there have been sporadic outbreaks of the same
sort since that date.'

"You will observe," said Holmes, laying down the volume, "that
the sudden breaking up of the society was coincident with the
disappearance of Openshaw from America with their papers. It may
well have been cause and effect. It is no wonder that he and his
family have some of the more implacable spirits upon their track.
You can understand that this register and diary may implicate some
of the first men in the South, and that there may be many who will
not sleep easy at night until it is recovered."

"Then the page we have seen—"

"Is such as we might expect. It ran, if I remember right, 'sent
the pips to A, B, and C'—that is, sent the society's warning to
them. Then there are successive entries that A and B cleared, or
left the country, and finally that C was visited, with, I fear, a
sinister result for C. Well, I think, Doctor, that we may let some
light into this dark place, and I believe that the only chance
young Openshaw has in the meantime is to do what I have told him.
There is nothing more to be said or to be done to-night, so hand me
over my violin and let us try to forget for half an hour the
miserable weather and the still more miserable ways of our
fellow-men."
