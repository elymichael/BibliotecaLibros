<br/>"To smoke," he answered. "It is quite a three pipe problem, and<br/>I beg that you won't speak to me for fifty minutes." He curled<br/>himself up in his chair, with his thin knees drawn up to his<br/>hawk-like nose, and there he sat with his eyes closed and his black<br/>clay pipe thrusting out like the bill of some strange bird. I had<br/>come to the conclusion that he had dropped asleep, and indeed was<br/>nodding myself, when he suddenly sprang out of his chair with the<br/>gesture of a man who has made up his mind and put his pipe down<br/>upon the mantelpiece.<br/><br/>"Sarasate plays at the St. James's Hall this afternoon," he<br/>remarked. "What do you think, Watson? Could your patients spare you<br/>for a few hours?"<br/><br/>"I have nothing to do to-day. My practice is never very<br/>absorbing."<br/><br/>"Then put on your hat and come. I am going through the City<br/>first, and we can have some lunch on the way. I observe that there<br/>is a good deal of German music on the programme, which is rather<br/>more to my taste than Italian or French. It is introspective, and I<br/>want to introspect. Come along!"<br/><br/>We travelled by the Underground as far as Aldersgate; and a<br/>short walk took us to Saxe-Coburg Square, the scene of the singular<br/>story which we had listened to in the morning. It was a poky,<br/>little, shabby-genteel place, where four lines of dingy two-storied<br/>brick houses looked out into a small railed-in enclosure, where a<br/>lawn of weedy grass and a few clumps of faded laurel-bushes made a<br/>hard fight against a smoke-laden and uncongenial atmosphere. Three<br/>gilt balls and a brown board with "JABEZ WILSON" in white letters,<br/>upon a corner house, announced the place where our red-headed<br/>client carried on his business. Sherlock Holmes stopped in front of<br/>it with his head on one side and looked it all over, with his eyes<br/>shining brightly between puckered lids. Then he walked slowly up<br/>the street, and then down again to the corner, still looking keenly<br/>at the houses. Finally he returned to the pawnbroker's, and, having<br/>thumped vigorously upon the pavement with his stick two or three<br/>times, he went up to the door and knocked. It was instantly opened<br/>by a bright-looking, clean-shaven young fellow, who asked him to<br/>step in.<br/><br/>"Thank you," said Holmes, "I only wished to ask you how you<br/>would go from here to the Strand."<br/><br/>"Third right, fourth left," answered the assistant promptly,<br/>closing the door.<br/><br/>"Smart fellow, that," observed Holmes as we walked away. "He is,<br/>in my judgment, the fourth smartest man in London, and for daring I<br/>am not sure that he has not a claim to be third. I have known<br/>something of him before."<br/><br/>"Evidently," said I, "Mr. Wilson's assistant counts for a good<br/>deal in this mystery of the Red-headed League. I am sure that you<br/>inquired your way merely in order that you might see him."<br/><br/>"Not him."<br/><br/>
