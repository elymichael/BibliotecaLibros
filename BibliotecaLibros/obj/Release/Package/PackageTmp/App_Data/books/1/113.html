<br/>It was not the first time that she had spoken to us of her<br/>husband's trouble, to me as a doctor, to my wife as an old friend<br/>and school companion. We soothed and comforted her by such words as<br/>we could find. Did she know where her husband was? Was it possible<br/>that we could bring him back to her?<br/><br/>It seems that it was. She had the surest information that of<br/>late he had, when the fit was on him, made use of an opium den in<br/>the farthest east of the City. Hitherto his orgies had always been<br/>confined to one day, and he had come back, twitching and shattered,<br/>in the evening. But now the spell had been upon him eight-and-forty<br/>hours, and he lay there, doubtless among the dregs of the docks,<br/>breathing in the poison or sleeping off the effects. There he was<br/>to be found, she was sure of it, at the Bar of Gold, in Upper<br/>Swandam Lane. But what was she to do? How could she, a young and<br/>timid woman, make her way into such a place and pluck her husband<br/>out from among the ruffians who surrounded him?<br/><br/>There was the case, and of course there was but one way out of<br/>it. Might I not escort her to this place? And then, as a second<br/>thought, why should she come at all? I was Isa Whitney's medical<br/>adviser, and as such I had influence over him. I could manage it<br/>better if I were alone. I promised her on my word that I would send<br/>him home in a cab within two hours if he were indeed at the address<br/>which she had given me. And so in ten minutes I had left my<br/>armchair and cheery sitting-room behind me, and was speeding<br/>eastward in a hansom on a strange errand, as it seemed to me at the<br/>time, though the future only could show how strange it was to<br/>be.<br/><br/>But there was no great difficulty in the first stage of my<br/>adventure. Upper Swandam Lane is a vile alley lurking behind the<br/>high wharves which line the north side of the river to the east of<br/>London Bridge. Between a slop-shop and a gin-shop, approached by a<br/>steep flight of steps leading down to a black gap like the mouth of<br/>a cave, I found the den of which I was in search. Ordering my cab<br/>to wait, I passed down the steps, worn hollow in the centre by the<br/>ceaseless tread of drunken feet; and by the light of a flickering<br/>oil-lamp above the door I found the latch and made my way into a<br/>long, low room, thick and heavy with the brown opium smoke, and<br/>terraced with wooden berths, like the forecastle of an emigrant<br/>ship.<br/><br/>Through the gloom one could dimly catch a glimpse of bodies<br/>lying in strange fantastic poses, bowed shoulders, bent knees,<br/>heads thrown back, and chins pointing upward, with here and there a<br/>dark, lack-lustre eye turned upon the newcomer. Out of the black<br/>shadows there glimmered little red circles of light, now bright,<br/>now faint, as the burning poison waxed or waned in the bowls of the<br/>metal pipes. The most lay silent, but some muttered to themselves,<br/>and others talked together in a strange, low, monotonous voice,<br/>their conversation coming in gushes, and then suddenly tailing off<br/>into silence, each mumbling out his own thoughts and paying little<br/>heed to the words of his neighbour. At the farther end was a small<br/>brazier of burning charcoal, beside which on a three-legged wooden<br/>stool there sat a tall, thin old man, with his jaw resting upon his<br/>two fists, and his elbows upon his knees, staring into the<br/>fire.<br/><br/>As I entered, a sallow Malay attendant had hurried up with a<br/>pipe for me and a supply of the drug, beckoning me to an empty<br/>berth.<br/><br/>"Thank you. I have not come to stay," said I. "There is a friend<br/>of mine here, Mr. Isa Whitney, and I wish to speak with him."<br/><br/>There was a movement and an exclamation from my right, and<br/>peering through the gloom, I saw Whitney, pale, haggard, and<br/>unkempt, staring out at me.<br/><br/>"My God! It's Watson," said he. He was in a pitiable state of<br/>reaction, with every nerve in a twitter. "I say, Watson, what<br/>o'clock is it?"<br/><br/>"Nearly eleven."<br/><br/>
