<br/>"How is the glass? Twenty-nine, I see. No wind, and not a cloud<br/>in the sky. I have a caseful of cigarettes here which need smoking,<br/>and the sofa is very much superior to the usual country hotel<br/>abomination. I do not think that it is probable that I shall use<br/>the carriage to-night."<br/><br/>Lestrade laughed indulgently. "You have, no doubt, already<br/>formed your conclusions from the newspapers," he said. "The case is<br/>as plain as a pikestaff, and the more one goes into it the plainer<br/>it becomes. Still, of course, one can't refuse a lady, and such a<br/>very positive one, too. She has heard of you, and would have your<br/>opinion, though I repeatedly told her that there was nothing which<br/>you could do which I had not already done. Why, bless my soul! here<br/>is her carriage at the door."<br/><br/>He had hardly spoken before there rushed into the room one of<br/>the most lovely young women that I have ever seen in my life. Her<br/>violet eyes shining, her lips parted, a pink flush upon her cheeks,<br/>all thought of her natural reserve lost in her overpowering<br/>excitement and concern.<br/><br/>"Oh, Mr. Sherlock Holmes!" she cried, glancing from one to the<br/>other of us, and finally, with a woman's quick intuition, fastening<br/>upon my companion, "I am so glad that you have come. I have driven<br/>down to tell you so. I know that James didn't do it. I know it, and<br/>I want you to start upon your work knowing it, too. Never let<br/>yourself doubt upon that point. We have known each other since we<br/>were little children, and I know his faults as no one else does;<br/>but he is too tender-hearted to hurt a fly. Such a charge is absurd<br/>to anyone who really knows him."<br/><br/>"I hope we may clear him, Miss Turner," said Sherlock Holmes.<br/>"You may rely upon my doing all that I can."<br/><br/>"But you have read the evidence. You have formed some<br/>conclusion? Do you not see some loophole, some flaw? Do you not<br/>yourself think that he is innocent?"<br/><br/>"I think that it is very probable."<br/><br/>"There, now!" she cried, throwing back her head and looking<br/>defiantly at Lestrade. "You hear! He gives me hopes."<br/><br/>Lestrade shrugged his shoulders. "I am afraid that my colleague<br/>has been a little quick in forming his conclusions," he said.<br/><br/>"But he is right. Oh! I know that he is right. James never did<br/>it. And about his quarrel with his father, I am sure that the<br/>reason why he would not speak about it to the coroner was because I<br/>was concerned in it."<br/><br/>
