"Then pray send him home in it. You may safely trust him, for he
appears to be too limp to get into any mischief. I should recommend
you also to send a note by the cabman to your wife to say that you
have thrown in your lot with me. If you will wait outside, I shall
be with you in five minutes."

It was difficult to refuse any of Sherlock Holmes' requests, for
they were always so exceedingly definite, and put forward with such
a quiet air of mastery. I felt, however, that when Whitney was once
confined in the cab my mission was practically accomplished; and
for the rest, I could not wish anything better than to be
associated with my friend in one of those singular adventures which
were the normal condition of his existence. In a few minutes I had
written my note, paid Whitney's bill, led him out to the cab, and
seen him driven through the darkness. In a very short time a
decrepit figure had emerged from the opium den, and I was walking
down the street with Sherlock Holmes. For two streets he shuffled
along with a bent back and an uncertain foot. Then, glancing
quickly round, he straightened himself out and burst into a hearty
fit of laughter.

"I suppose, Watson," said he, "that you imagine that I have
added opium-smoking to cocaine injections, and all the other little
weaknesses on which you have favoured me with your medical
views."

"I was certainly surprised to find you there."

"But not more so than I to find you."

"I came to find a friend."

"And I to find an enemy."

"An enemy?"

"Yes; one of my natural enemies, or, shall I say, my natural
prey. Briefly, Watson, I am in the midst of a very remarkable
inquiry, and I have hoped to find a clue in the incoherent
ramblings of these sots, as I have done before now. Had I been
recognised in that den my life would not have been worth an hour's
purchase; for I have used it before now for my own purposes, and
the rascally Lascar who runs it has sworn to have vengeance upon
me. There is a trap-door at the back of that building, near the
corner of Paul's Wharf, which could tell some strange tales of what
has passed through it upon the moonless nights."

"What! You do not mean bodies?"
