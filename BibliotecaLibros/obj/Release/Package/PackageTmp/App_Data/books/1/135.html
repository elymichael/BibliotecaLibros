<br/><br/><br/>I had called upon my friend Sherlock Holmes upon the second<br/>morning after Christmas, with the intention of wishing him the<br/>compliments of the season. He was lounging upon the sofa in a<br/>purple dressing-gown, a pipe-rack within his reach upon the right,<br/>and a pile of crumpled morning papers, evidently newly studied,<br/>near at hand. Beside the couch was a wooden chair, and on the angle<br/>of the back hung a very seedy and disreputable hard-felt hat, much<br/>the worse for wear, and cracked in several places. A lens and a<br/>forceps lying upon the seat of the chair suggested that the hat had<br/>been suspended in this manner for the purpose of examination.<br/><br/>"You are engaged," said I; "perhaps I interrupt you."<br/><br/>"Not at all. I am glad to have a friend with whom I can discuss<br/>my results. The matter is a perfectly trivial one"—he jerked his<br/>thumb in the direction of the old hat—"but there are points in<br/>connection with it which are not entirely devoid of interest and<br/>even of instruction."<br/><br/>I seated myself in his armchair and warmed my hands before his<br/>crackling fire, for a sharp frost had set in, and the windows were<br/>thick with the ice crystals. "I suppose," I remarked, "that, homely<br/>as it looks, this thing has some deadly story linked on to it—that<br/>it is the clue which will guide you in the solution of some mystery<br/>and the punishment of some crime."<br/><br/>"No, no. No crime," said Sherlock Holmes, laughing. "Only one of<br/>those whimsical little incidents which will happen when you have<br/>four million human beings all jostling each other within the space<br/>of a few square miles. Amid the action and reaction of so dense a<br/>swarm of humanity, every possible combination of events may be<br/>expected to take place, and many a little problem will be presented<br/>which may be striking and bizarre without being criminal. We have<br/>already had experience of such."<br/><br/>"So much so," I remarked, "that of the last six cases which I<br/>have added to my notes, three have been entirely free of any legal<br/>crime."<br/><br/>"Precisely. You allude to my attempt to recover the Irene Adler<br/>papers, to the singular case of Miss Mary Sutherland, and to the<br/>adventure of the man with the twisted lip. Well, I have no doubt<br/>that this small matter will fall into the same innocent category.<br/>You know Peterson, the commissionaire?"<br/><br/>"Yes."<br/><br/>"It is to him that this trophy belongs."<br/><br/>"It is his hat."<br/>
