"That must have been Tink. I never knew her so naughty<br/>before."<br/><br/>And indeed Tink was darting about again, using offensive<br/>language.<br/><br/>"She says she will do that to you, Wendy, every time I give you<br/>a thimble."<br/><br/>"But why?"<br/><br/>"Why, Tink?"<br/><br/>Again Tink replied, "You silly ass." Peter could not understand<br/>why, but Wendy understood, and she was just slightly disappointed<br/>when he admitted that he came to the nursery window not to see her<br/>but to listen to stories.<br/><br/>"You see, I don't know any stories. None of the lost boys knows<br/>any stories."<br/><br/>"How perfectly awful," Wendy said.<br/><br/>"Do you know," Peter asked "why swallows build in the eaves of<br/>houses? It is to listen to the stories. O Wendy, your mother was<br/>telling you such a lovely story."<br/><br/>"Which story was it?"<br/><br/>"About the prince who couldn't find the lady who wore the glass<br/>slipper."<br/>
