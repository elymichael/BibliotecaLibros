<br/>"Wendy," he whispered gleefully, "I do believe I shut her up in<br/>the drawer!"<br/><br/>He let poor Tink out of the drawer, and she flew about the<br/>nursery screaming with fury. "You shouldn't say such things," Peter<br/>retorted. "Of course I'm very sorry, but how could I know you were<br/>in the drawer?"<br/><br/>Wendy was not listening to him. "O Peter," she cried, "if she<br/>would only stand still and let me see her!"<br/><br/>"They hardly ever stand still," he said, but for one moment<br/>Wendy saw the romantic figure come to rest on the cuckoo clock. "O<br/>the lovely!" she cried, though Tink's face was still distorted with<br/>passion.<br/><br/>"Tink," said Peter amiably, "this lady says she wishes you were<br/>her fairy."<br/><br/>Tinker Bell answered insolently.<br/><br/>"What does she say, Peter?"<br/><br/>He had to translate. "She is not very polite. She says you are a<br/>great [huge] ugly girl, and that she is my fairy."<br/><br/>He tried to argue with Tink. "You know you can't be my fairy,<br/>Tink, because I am an gentleman and you are a lady."<br/><br/>To this Tink replied in these words, "You silly ass," and<br/>disappeared into the bathroom. "She is quite a common fairy," Peter<br/>explained apologetically, "she is called Tinker Bell because she<br/>mends the pots and kettles [tinker = tin worker]." [Similar to<br/>"cinder" plus "elle" to get Cinderella]<br/><br/>
