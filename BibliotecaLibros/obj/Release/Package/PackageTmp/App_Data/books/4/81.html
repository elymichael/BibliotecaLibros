<br/>While she stitched a change came to the lagoon. Little shivers<br/>ran over it, and the sun went away and shadows stole across the<br/>water, turning it cold. Wendy could no longer see to thread her<br/>needle, and when she looked up, the lagoon that had always hitherto<br/>been such a laughing place seemed formidable and unfriendly.<br/><br/>It was not, she knew, that night had come, but something as dark<br/>as night had come. No, worse than that. It had not come, but it had<br/>sent that shiver through the sea to say that it was coming. What<br/>was it?<br/><br/>There crowded upon her all the stories she had been told of<br/>Marooners' Rock, so called because evil captains put sailors on it<br/>and leave them there to drown. They drown when the tide rises, for<br/>then it is submerged.<br/><br/>Of course she should have roused the children at once; not<br/>merely because of the unknown that was stalking toward them, but<br/>because it was no longer good for them to sleep on a rock grown<br/>chilly. But she was a young mother and she did not know this; she<br/>thought you simply must stick to your rule about half an hour after<br/>the mid-day meal. So, though fear was upon her, and she longed to<br/>hear male voices, she would not waken them. Even when she heard the<br/>sound of muffled oars, though her heart was in her mouth, she did<br/>not waken them. She stood over them to let them have their sleep<br/>out. Was it not brave of Wendy?<br/><br/>It was well for those boys then that there was one among them<br/>who could sniff danger even in his sleep. Peter sprang erect, as<br/>wide awake at once as a dog, and with one warning cry he roused the<br/>others.<br/><br/>He stood motionless, one hand to his ear.<br/><br/>"Pirates!" he cried. The others came closer to him. A strange<br/>smile was playing about his face, and Wendy saw it and shuddered.<br/>While that smile was on his face no one dared address him; all they<br/>could do was to stand ready to obey. The order came sharp and<br/>incisive.<br/><br/>"Dive!"<br/><br/>There was a gleam of legs, and instantly the lagoon seemed<br/>deserted. Marooners' Rock stood alone in the forbidding waters as<br/>if it were itself marooned.<br/><br/>The boat drew nearer. It was the pirate dinghy, with three<br/>figures in her, Smee and Starkey, and the third a captive, no other<br/>than Tiger Lily. Her hands and ankles were tied, and she knew what<br/>was to be her fate. She was to be left on the rock to perish, an<br/>end to one of her race more terrible than death by fire or torture,<br/>for is it not written in the book of the tribe that there is no<br/>path through water to the happy hunting-ground? Yet her face was<br/>impassive; she was the daughter of a chief, she must die as a<br/>chief's daughter, it is enough.<br/><br/>
