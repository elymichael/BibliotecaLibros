<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>3<br/>COME AWAY, COME AWAY!<br/><br/><br/>For a moment after Mr. and Mrs. Darling left the house the<br/>night-lights by the beds of the three children continued to burn<br/>clearly. They were awfully nice little night-lights, and one cannot<br/>help wishing that they could have kept awake to see Peter; but<br/>Wendy's light blinked and gave such a yawn that the other two<br/>yawned also, and before they could close their mouths all the three<br/>went out.<br/><br/>There was another light in the room now, a thousand times<br/>brighter than the night-lights, and in the time we have taken to<br/>say this, it had been in all the drawers in the nursery, looking<br/>for Peter's shadow, rummaged the wardrobe and turned every pocket<br/>inside out. It was not really a light; it made this light by<br/>flashing about so quickly, but when it came to rest for a second<br/>you saw it was a fairy, no longer than your hand, but still<br/>growing. It was a girl called Tinker Bell exquisitely gowned in a<br/>skeleton leaf, cut low and square, through which her figure could<br/>be seen to the best advantage. She was slightly inclined to<br/>EMBONPOINT. [plump hourglass figure]<br/><br/>A moment after the fairy's entrance the window was blown open by<br/>the breathing of the little stars, and Peter dropped in. He had<br/>carried Tinker Bell part of the way, and his hand was still messy<br/>with the fairy dust.<br/><br/>"Tinker Bell," he called softly, after making sure that the<br/>children were asleep, "Tink, where are you?" She was in a jug for<br/>the moment, and liking it extremely; she had never been in a jug<br/>before.<br/><br/>"Oh, do come out of that jug, and tell me, do you know where<br/>they put my shadow?"<br/><br/>The loveliest tinkle as of golden bells answered him. It is the<br/>fairy language. You ordinary children can never hear it, but if you<br/>were to hear it you would know that you had heard it once<br/>before.<br/><br/>Tink said that the shadow was in the big box. She meant the<br/>chest of drawers, and Peter jumped at the drawers, scattering their<br/>contents to the floor with both hands, as kings toss ha'pence to<br/>the crowd. In a moment he had recovered his shadow, and in his<br/>delight he forgot that he had shut Tinker Bell up in the<br/>drawer.<br/>
