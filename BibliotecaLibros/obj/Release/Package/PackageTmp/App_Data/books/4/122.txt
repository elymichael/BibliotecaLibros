"And you will take your medicine?"

"Yes."

That seemed to be everything, and an awkward pause followed.
Peter, however, was not the kind that breaks down before other
people. "Are you ready, Tinker Bell?" he called out.

"Ay, ay."

"Then lead the way."

Tink darted up the nearest tree; but no one followed her, for it
was at this moment that the pirates made their dreadful attack upon
the redskins. Above, where all had been so still, the air was rent
with shrieks and the clash of steel. Below, there was dead silence.
Mouths opened and remained open. Wendy fell on her knees, but her
arms were extended toward Peter. All arms were extended to him, as
if suddenly blown in his direction; they were beseeching him mutely
not to desert them. As for Peter, he seized his sword, the same he
thought he had slain Barbecue with, and the lust of battle was in
his eye.
