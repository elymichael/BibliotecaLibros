<br/>"Seems to me," growled John, "these are the only two things<br/>worth doing."<br/><br/>Here he got a pinch, but not a loving one.<br/><br/>"If only one of us had a pocket," Peter said, "we could carry<br/>her in it." However, they had set off in such a hurry that there<br/>was not a pocket between the four of them.<br/><br/>He had a happy idea. John's hat!<br/><br/>Tink agreed to travel by hat if it was carried in the hand. John<br/>carried it, though she had hoped to be carried by Peter. Presently<br/>Wendy took the hat, because John said it struck against his knee as<br/>he flew; and this, as we shall see, led to mischief, for Tinker<br/>Bell hated to be under an obligation to Wendy.<br/><br/>In the black topper the light was completely hidden, and they<br/>flew on in silence. It was the stillest silence they had ever<br/>known, broken once by a distant lapping, which Peter explained was<br/>the wild beasts drinking at the ford, and again by a rasping sound<br/>that might have been the branches of trees rubbing together, but he<br/>said it was the redskins sharpening their knives.<br/><br/>Even these noises ceased. To Michael the loneliness was<br/>dreadful. "If only something would make a sound!" he cried.<br/><br/>As if in answer to his request, the air was rent by the most<br/>tremendous crash he had ever heard. The pirates had fired Long Tom<br/>at them.<br/><br/>The roar of it echoed through the mountains, and the echoes<br/>seemed to cry savagely, "Where are they, where are they, where are<br/>they?"<br/><br/>Thus sharply did the terrified three learn the difference<br/>between an island of make-believe and the same island come<br/>true.<br/><br/>
