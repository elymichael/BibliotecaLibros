Peter flew in looking for his shadow.

"The foolish fellow," says Wendy, "tried to stick it on with
soap, and when he could not he cried, and that woke me, and I sewed
it on for him."

"You have missed a bit," interrupts Jane, who now knows the
story better than her mother. "When you saw him sitting on the
floor crying, what did you say?"

"I sat up in bed and I said, 'Boy, why are you crying?'"

"Yes, that was it," says Jane, with a big breath.

"And then he flew us all away to the Neverland and the fairies
and the pirates and the redskins and the mermaid's lagoon, and the
home under the ground, and the little house."

"Yes! which did you like best of all?"

"I think I liked the home under the ground best of all."
