"They were married, you know," explained Wendy, "and what do you
think they had?"

"White rats," cried Nibs, inspired.

"No."

"It's awfully puzzling," said Tootles, who knew the story by
heart.

"Quiet, Tootles. They had three descendants."

"What is descendants?"

"Well, you are one, Twin."

"Did you hear that, John? I am a descendant."

"Descendants are only children," said John.

"Oh dear, oh dear," sighed Wendy. "Now these three children had
a faithful nurse called Nana; but Mr. Darling was angry with her
and chained her up in the yard, and so all the children flew
away."

"It's an awfully good story," said Nibs.
