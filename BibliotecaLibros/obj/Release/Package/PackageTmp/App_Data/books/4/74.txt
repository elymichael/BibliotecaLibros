They were very ashamed, but Tootles gave the sole of his shoe,
and it made an excellent knocker.

Absolutely finished now, they thought.

Not of bit of it. "There's no chimney," Peter said; "we must
have a chimney."

"It certainly does need a chimney," said John importantly. This
gave Peter an idea. He snatched the hat off John's head, knocked
out the bottom [top], and put the hat on the roof. The little house
was so pleased to have such a capital chimney that, as if to say
thank you, smoke immediately began to come out of the hat.

Now really and truly it was finished. Nothing remained to do but
to knock.

"All look your best," Peter warned them; "first impressions are
awfully important."

He was glad no one asked him what first impressions are; they
were all too busy looking their best.

He knocked politely, and now the wood was as still as the
children, not a sound to be heard except from Tinker Bell, who was
watching from a branch and openly sneering.

What the boys were wondering was, would any one answer the
knock? If a lady, what would she be like?

The door opened and a lady came out. It was Wendy. They all
whipped off their hats.

She looked properly surprised, and this was just how they had
hoped she would look.
