<br/>The first thing he did on finding himself alone in the fast<br/>falling night was to tiptoe to Slightly's tree, and make sure that<br/>it provided him with a passage. Then for long he remained brooding;<br/>his hat of ill omen on the sward, so that any gentle breeze which<br/>had arisen might play refreshingly through his hair. Dark as were<br/>his thoughts his blue eyes were as soft as the periwinkle. Intently<br/>he listened for any sound from the nether world, but all was as<br/>silent below as above; the house under the ground seemed to be but<br/>one more empty tenement in the void. Was that boy asleep, or did he<br/>stand waiting at the foot of Slightly's tree, with his dagger in<br/>his hand?<br/><br/>There was no way of knowing, save by going down. Hook let his<br/>cloak slip softly to the ground, and then biting his lips till a<br/>lewd blood stood on them, he stepped into the tree. He was a brave<br/>man, but for a moment he had to stop there and wipe his brow, which<br/>was dripping like a candle. Then, silently, he let himself go into<br/>the unknown.<br/><br/>He arrived unmolested at the foot of the shaft, and stood still<br/>again, biting at his breath, which had almost left him. As his eyes<br/>became accustomed to the dim light various objects in the home<br/>under the trees took shape; but the only one on which his greedy<br/>gaze rested, long sought for and found at last, was the great bed.<br/>On the bed lay Peter fast asleep.<br/><br/>Unaware of the tragedy being enacted above, Peter had continued,<br/>for a little time after the children left, to play gaily on his<br/>pipes: no doubt rather a forlorn attempt to prove to himself that<br/>he did not care. Then he decided not to take his medicine, so as to<br/>grieve Wendy. Then he lay down on the bed outside the coverlet, to<br/>vex her still more; for she had always tucked them inside it,<br/>because you never know that you may not grow chilly at the turn of<br/>the night. Then he nearly cried; but it struck him how indignant<br/>she would be if he laughed instead; so he laughed a haughty laugh<br/>and fell asleep in the middle of it.<br/><br/>Sometimes, though not often, he had dreams, and they were more<br/>painful than the dreams of other boys. For hours he could not be<br/>separated from these dreams, though he wailed piteously in them.<br/>They had to do, I think, with the riddle of his existence. At such<br/>times it had been Wendy's custom to take him out of bed and sit<br/>with him on her lap, soothing him in dear ways of her own<br/>invention, and when he grew calmer to put him back to bed before he<br/>quite woke up, so that he should not know of the indignity to which<br/>she had subjected him. But on this occasion he had fallen at once<br/>into a dreamless sleep. One arm dropped over the edge of the bed,<br/>one leg was arched, and the unfinished part of his laugh was<br/>stranded on his mouth, which was open, showing the little<br/>pearls.<br/><br/>Thus defenceless Hook found him. He stood silent at the foot of<br/>the tree looking across the chamber at his enemy. Did no feeling of<br/>compassion disturb his sombre breast? The man was not wholly evil;<br/>he loved flowers (I have been told) and sweet music (he was himself<br/>no mean performer on the harpsichord); and, let it be frankly<br/>admitted, the idyllic nature of the scene stirred him profoundly.<br/>Mastered by his better self he would have returned reluctantly up<br/>the tree, but for one thing.<br/><br/>What stayed him was Peter's impertinent appearance as he slept.<br/>The open mouth, the drooping arm, the arched knee: they were such a<br/>personification of cockiness as, taken together, will never again,<br/>one may hope, be presented to eyes so sensitive to their<br/>offensiveness. They steeled Hook's heart. If his rage had broken<br/>him into a hundred pieces every one of them would have disregarded<br/>the incident, and leapt at the sleeper.<br/><br/>Though a light from the one lamp shone dimly on the bed, Hook<br/>stood in darkness himself, and at the first stealthy step forward<br/>he discovered an obstacle, the door of Slightly's tree. It did not<br/>entirely fill the aperture, and he had been looking over it.<br/>Feeling for the catch, he found to his fury that it was low down,<br/>beyond his reach. To his disordered brain it seemed then that the<br/>irritating quality in Peter's face and figure visibly increased,<br/>and he rattled the door and flung himself against it. Was his enemy<br/>to escape him after all?<br/><br/>But what was that? The red in his eye had caught sight of<br/>Peter's medicine standing on a ledge within easy reach. He fathomed<br/>what it was straightaway, and immediately knew that the sleeper was<br/>in his power.<br/><br/>Lest he should be taken alive, Hook always carried about his<br/>person a dreadful drug, blended by himself of all the death-dealing<br/>rings that had come into his possession. These he had boiled down<br/>into a yellow liquid quite unknown to science, which was probably<br/>the most virulent poison in existence.<br/><br/>
