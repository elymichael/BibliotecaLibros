<br/>"Peter," said Wendy excitedly, "that was Cinderella, and he<br/>found her, and they lived happily ever after."<br/><br/>Peter was so glad that he rose from the floor, where they had<br/>been sitting, and hurried to the window.<br/><br/>"Where are you going?" she cried with misgiving.<br/><br/>"To tell the other boys."<br/><br/>"Don't go Peter," she entreated, "I know such lots of<br/>stories."<br/><br/>Those were her precise words, so there can be no denying that it<br/>was she who first tempted him.<br/><br/>He came back, and there was a greedy look in his eyes now which<br/>ought to have alarmed her, but did not.<br/><br/>"Oh, the stories I could tell to the boys!" she cried, and then<br/>Peter gripped her and began to draw her toward the window.<br/><br/>"Let me go!" she ordered him.<br/><br/>"Wendy, do come with me and tell the other boys."<br/><br/>
