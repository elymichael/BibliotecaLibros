<br/>"George, George," Mrs. Darling whispered, "remember what I told<br/>you about that boy."<br/><br/>Alas, he would not listen. He was determined to show who was<br/>master in that house, and when commands would not draw Nana from<br/>the kennel, he lured her out of it with honeyed words, and seizing<br/>her roughly, dragged her from the nursery. He was ashamed of<br/>himself, and yet he did it. It was all owing to his too<br/>affectionate nature, which craved for admiration. When he had tied<br/>her up in the back-yard, the wretched father went and sat in the<br/>passage, with his knuckles to his eyes.<br/><br/>In the meantime Mrs. Darling had put the children to bed in<br/>unwonted silence and lit their night-lights. They could hear Nana<br/>barking, and John whimpered, "It is because he is chaining her up<br/>in the yard," but Wendy was wiser.<br/><br/>"That is not Nana's unhappy bark," she said, little guessing<br/>what was about to happen; "that is her bark when she smells<br/>danger."<br/><br/>Danger!<br/><br/>"Are you sure, Wendy?"<br/><br/>"Oh, yes."<br/><br/>Mrs. Darling quivered and went to the window. It was securely<br/>fastened. She looked out, and the night was peppered with stars.<br/>They were crowding round the house, as if curious to see what was<br/>to take place there, but she did not notice this, nor that one or<br/>two of the smaller ones winked at her. Yet a nameless fear clutched<br/>at her heart and made her cry, "Oh, how I wish that I wasn't going<br/>to a party to-night!"<br/><br/>Even Michael, already half asleep, knew that she was perturbed,<br/>and he asked, "Can anything harm us, mother, after the night-lights<br/>are lit?"<br/><br/>"Nothing, precious," she said; "they are the eyes a mother<br/>leaves behind her to guard her children."<br/><br/>
