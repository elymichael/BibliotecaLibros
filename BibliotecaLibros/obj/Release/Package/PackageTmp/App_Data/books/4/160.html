<br/>"Let us all slip into our beds, and be there when she comes in,<br/>just as if we had never been away."<br/><br/>And so when Mrs. Darling went back to the night-nursery to see<br/>if her husband was asleep, all the beds were occupied. The children<br/>waited for her cry of joy, but it did not come. She saw them, but<br/>she did not believe they were there. You see, she saw them in their<br/>beds so often in her dreams that she thought this was just the<br/>dream hanging around her still.<br/><br/>She sat down in the chair by the fire, where in the old days she<br/>had nursed them.<br/><br/>They could not understand this, and a cold fear fell upon all<br/>the three of them.<br/><br/>"Mother!" Wendy cried.<br/><br/>"That's Wendy," she said, but still she was sure it was the<br/>dream.<br/><br/>"Mother!"<br/><br/>"That's John," she said.<br/><br/>"Mother!" cried Michael. He knew her now.<br/><br/>"That's Michael," she said, and she stretched out her arms for<br/>the three little selfish children they would never envelop again.<br/>Yes, they did, they went round Wendy and John and Michael, who had<br/>slipped out of bed and run to her.<br/><br/>
