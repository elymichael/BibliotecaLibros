<br/>They all heard itâ€”pirates, boys, Wendy; and immediately every<br/>head was blown in one direction; not to the water whence the sound<br/>proceeded, but toward Hook. All knew that what was about to happen<br/>concerned him alone, and that from being actors they were suddenly<br/>become spectators.<br/><br/>Very frightful was it to see the change that came over him. It<br/>was as if he had been clipped at every joint. He fell in a little<br/>heap.<br/><br/>The sound came steadily nearer; and in advance of it came this<br/>ghastly thought, "The crocodile is about to board the ship!"<br/><br/>Even the iron claw hung inactive; as if knowing that it was no<br/>intrinsic part of what the attacking force wanted. Left so<br/>fearfully alone, any other man would have lain with his eyes shut<br/>where he fell: but the gigantic brain of Hook was still working,<br/>and under its guidance he crawled on the knees along the deck as<br/>far from the sound as he could go. The pirates respectfully cleared<br/>a passage for him, and it was only when he brought up against the<br/>bulwarks that he spoke.<br/><br/>"Hide me!" he cried hoarsely.<br/><br/>They gathered round him, all eyes averted from the thing that<br/>was coming aboard. They had no thought of fighting it. It was<br/>Fate.<br/><br/>Only when Hook was hidden from them did curiosity loosen the<br/>limbs of the boys so that they could rush to the ship's side to see<br/>the crocodile climbing it. Then they got the strangest surprise of<br/>the Night of Nights; for it was no crocodile that was coming to<br/>their aid. It was Peter.<br/><br/>He signed to them not to give vent to any cry of admiration that<br/>might rouse suspicion. Then he went on ticking.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
