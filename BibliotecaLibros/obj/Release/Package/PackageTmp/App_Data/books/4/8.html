<br/>While she slept she had a dream. She dreamt that the Neverland<br/>had come too near and that a strange boy had broken through from<br/>it. He did not alarm her, for she thought she had seen him before<br/>in the faces of many women who have no children. Perhaps he is to<br/>be found in the faces of some mothers also. But in her dream he had<br/>rent the film that obscures the Neverland, and she saw Wendy and<br/>John and Michael peeping through the gap.<br/><br/>The dream by itself would have been a trifle, but while she was<br/>dreaming the window of the nursery blew open, and a boy did drop on<br/>the floor. He was accompanied by a strange light, no bigger than<br/>your fist, which darted about the room like a living thing and I<br/>think it must have been this light that wakened Mrs. Darling.<br/><br/>She started up with a cry, and saw the boy, and somehow she knew<br/>at once that he was Peter Pan. If you or I or Wendy had been there<br/>we should have seen that he was very like Mrs. Darling's kiss. He<br/>was a lovely boy, clad in skeleton leaves and the juices that ooze<br/>out of trees but the most entrancing thing about him was that he<br/>had all his first teeth. When he saw she was a grown-up, he gnashed<br/>the little pearls at her.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
