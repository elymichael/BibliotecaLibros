"You see, Wendy, when the first baby laughed for the first time,
its laugh broke into a thousand pieces, and they all went skipping
about, and that was the beginning of fairies."

Tedious talk this, but being a stay-at-home she liked it.

"And so," he went on good-naturedly, "there ought to be one
fairy for every boy and girl."

"Ought to be? Isn't there?"

"No. You see children know such a lot now, they soon don't
believe in fairies, and every time a child says, 'I don't believe
in fairies,' there is a fairy somewhere that falls down dead."

Really, he thought they had now talked enough about fairies, and
it struck him that Tinker Bell was keeping very quiet. "I can't
think where she has gone to," he said, rising, and he called Tink
by name. Wendy's heart went flutter with a sudden thrill.

"Peter," she cried, clutching him, "you don't mean to tell me
that there is a fairy in this room!"

"She was here just now," he said a little impatiently. "You
don't hear her, do you?" and they both listened.

"The only sound I hear," said Wendy, "is like a tinkle of
bells."

"Well, that's Tink, that's the fairy language. I think I hear
her too."

The sound come from the chest of drawers, and Peter made a merry
face. No one could ever look quite so merry as Peter, and the
loveliest of gurgles was his laugh. He had his first laugh
still.
