In a moment they were as busy as tailors the night before a<br/>wedding. They skurried this way and that, down for bedding, up for<br/>firewood, and while they were at it, who should appear but John and<br/>Michael. As they dragged along the ground they fell asleep<br/>standing, stopped, woke up, moved another step and slept again.<br/><br/>"John, John," Michael would cry, "wake up! Where is Nana, John,<br/>and mother?"<br/><br/>And then John would rub his eyes and mutter, "It is true, we did<br/>fly."<br/><br/>You may be sure they were very relieved to find Peter.<br/><br/>"Hullo, Peter," they said.<br/><br/>"Hullo," replied Peter amicably, though he had quite forgotten<br/>them. He was very busy at the moment measuring Wendy with his feet<br/>to see how large a house she would need. Of course he meant to<br/>leave room for chairs and a table. John and Michael watched<br/>him.<br/><br/>"Is Wendy asleep?" they asked.<br/><br/>"Yes."<br/><br/>"John," Michael proposed, "let us wake her and get her to make<br/>supper for us," but as he said it some of the other boys rushed on<br/>carrying branches for the building of the house. "Look at them!" he<br/>cried.<br/><br/>"Curly," said Peter in his most captainy voice, "see that these<br/>boys help in the building of the house."<br/><br/>"Ay, ay, sir."<br/>
