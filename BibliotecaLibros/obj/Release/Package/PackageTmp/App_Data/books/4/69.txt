"Then we shall build a house round them."

"Ay," said Slightly, "that is how a house is built; it all comes
back to me."

Peter thought of everything. "Slightly," he cried, "fetch a
doctor."

"Ay, ay," said Slightly at once, and disappeared, scratching his
head. But he knew Peter must be obeyed, and he returned in a
moment, wearing John's hat and looking solemn.
