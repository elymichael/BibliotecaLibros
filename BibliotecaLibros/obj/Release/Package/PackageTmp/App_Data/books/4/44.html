<br/>It came as the arrows went, leaving the island in gloom.<br/><br/>In the old days at home the Neverland had always begun to look a<br/>little dark and threatening by bedtime. Then unexplored patches<br/>arose in it and spread, black shadows moved about in them, the roar<br/>of the beasts of prey was quite different now, and above all, you<br/>lost the certainty that you would win. You were quite glad that the<br/>night-lights were on. You even liked Nana to say that this was just<br/>the mantelpiece over here, and that the Neverland was all<br/>make-believe.<br/><br/>Of course the Neverland had been make-believe in those days, but<br/>it was real now, and there were no night-lights, and it was getting<br/>darker every moment, and where was Nana?<br/><br/>They had been flying apart, but they huddled close to Peter now.<br/>His careless manner had gone at last, his eyes were sparkling, and<br/>a tingle went through them every time they touched his body. They<br/>were now over the fearsome island, flying so low that sometimes a<br/>tree grazed their feet. Nothing horrid was visible in the air, yet<br/>their progress had become slow and laboured, exactly as if they<br/>were pushing their way through hostile forces. Sometimes they hung<br/>in the air until Peter had beaten on it with his fists.<br/><br/>"They don't want us to land," he explained.<br/><br/>"Who are they?" Wendy whispered, shuddering.<br/><br/>But he could not or would not say. Tinker Bell had been asleep<br/>on his shoulder, but now he wakened her and sent her on in<br/>front.<br/><br/>Sometimes he poised himself in the air, listening intently, with<br/>his hand to his ear, and again he would stare down with eyes so<br/>bright that they seemed to bore two holes to earth. Having done<br/>these things, he went on again.<br/><br/>His courage was almost appalling. "Would you like an adventure<br/>now," he said casually to John, "or would you like to have your tea<br/>first?"<br/><br/>Wendy said "tea first" quickly, and Michael pressed her hand in<br/>gratitude, but the braver John hesitated.<br/><br/>
