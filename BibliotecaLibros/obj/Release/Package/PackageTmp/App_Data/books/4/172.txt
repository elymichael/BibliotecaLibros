"Yes, so do I. What was the last thing Peter ever said to
you?"

"The last thing he ever said to me was, 'Just always be waiting
for me, and then some night you will hear me crowing.'"

"Yes."

"But, alas, he forgot all about me," Wendy said it with a smile.
She was as grown up as that.

"What did his crow sound like?" Jane asked one evening.

"It was like this," Wendy said, trying to imitate Peter's
crow.

"No, it wasn't," Jane said gravely, "it was like this;" and she
did it ever so much better than her mother.

Wendy was a little startled. "My darling, how can you know?"

"I often hear it when I am sleeping," Jane said.

"Ah yes, many girls hear it when they are sleeping, but I was
the only one who heard it awake."

"Lucky you," said Jane.
