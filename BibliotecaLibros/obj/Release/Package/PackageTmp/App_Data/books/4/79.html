Or we could tell of that cake the pirates cooked so that the<br/>boys might eat it and perish; and how they placed it in one cunning<br/>spot after another; but always Wendy snatched it from the hands of<br/>her children, so that in time it lost its succulence, and became as<br/>hard as a stone, and was used as a missile, and Hook fell over it<br/>in the dark.<br/><br/>Or suppose we tell of the birds that were Peter's friends,<br/>particularly of the Never bird that built in a tree overhanging the<br/>lagoon, and how the nest fell into the water, and still the bird<br/>sat on her eggs, and Peter gave orders that she was not to be<br/>disturbed. That is a pretty story, and the end shows how grateful a<br/>bird can be; but if we tell it we must also tell the whole<br/>adventure of the lagoon, which would of course be telling two<br/>adventures rather than just one. A shorter adventure, and quite as<br/>exciting, was Tinker Bell's attempt, with the help of some street<br/>fairies, to have the sleeping Wendy conveyed on a great floating<br/>leaf to the mainland. Fortunately the leaf gave way and Wendy woke,<br/>thinking it was bath-time, and swam back. Or again, we might choose<br/>Peter's defiance of the lions, when he drew a circle round him on<br/>the ground with an arrow and dared them to cross it; and though he<br/>waited for hours, with the other boys and Wendy looking on<br/>breathlessly from trees, not one of them dared to accept his<br/>challenge.<br/><br/>Which of these adventures shall we choose? The best way will be<br/>to toss for it.<br/><br/>I have tossed, and the lagoon has won. This almost makes one<br/>wish that the gulch or the cake or Tink's leaf had won. Of course I<br/>could do it again, and make it best out of three; however, perhaps<br/>fairest to stick to the lagoon.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
