"I will call again in the evening," Slightly said; "give her
beef tea out of a cup with a spout to it;" but after he had
returned the hat to John he blew big breaths, which was his habit
on escaping from a difficulty.

In the meantime the wood had been alive with the sound of axes;
almost everything needed for a cosy dwelling already lay at Wendy's
feet.

"If only we knew," said one, "the kind of house she likes
best."

"Peter," shouted another, "she is moving in her sleep."

"Her mouth opens," cried a third, looking respectfully into it.
"Oh, lovely!"

"Perhaps she is going to sing in her sleep," said Peter. "Wendy,
sing the kind of house you would like to have."

Immediately, without opening her eyes, Wendy began to sing:


"I wish I had a pretty house,
The littlest ever seen,
With funny little red walls
