"Please, sir," said Peter, going to him, "are you a doctor?"

The difference between him and the other boys at such a time was
that they knew it was make-believe, while to him make-believe and
true were exactly the same thing. This sometimes troubled them, as
when they had to make-believe that they had had their dinners.

If they broke down in their make-believe he rapped them on the
knuckles.

"Yes, my little man," Slightly anxiously replied, who had
chapped knuckles.

"Please, sir," Peter explained, "a lady lies very ill."

She was lying at their feet, but Slightly had the sense not to
see her.

"Tut, tut, tut," he said, "where does she lie?"

"In yonder glade."

"I will put a glass thing in her mouth," said Slightly, and he
made-believe to do it, while Peter waited. It was an anxious moment
when the glass thing was withdrawn.

"How is she?" inquired Peter.

"Tut, tut, tut," said Slightly, "this has cured her."
