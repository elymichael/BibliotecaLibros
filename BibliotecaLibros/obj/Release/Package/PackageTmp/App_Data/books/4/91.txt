Hook was completely puzzled. "You ask him some questions," he
said to the others, wiping his damp brow.

Smee reflected. "I can't think of a thing," he said
regretfully.

"Can't guess, can't guess!" crowed Peter. "Do you give it
up?"

Of course in his pride he was carrying the game too far, and the
miscreants [villains] saw their chance.

"Yes, yes," they answered eagerly.

"Well, then," he cried, "I am Peter Pan."

Pan!

In a moment Hook was himself again, and Smee and Starkey were
his faithful henchmen.

"Now we have him," Hook shouted. "Into the water, Smee. Starkey,
mind the boat. Take him dead or alive!"

He leaped as he spoke, and simultaneously came the gay voice of
Peter.
