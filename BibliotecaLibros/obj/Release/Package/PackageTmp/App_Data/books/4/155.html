It may have been Quixotic, but it was magnificent. Soon the<br/>inward meaning of it leaked out, and the great heart of the public<br/>was touched. Crowds followed the cab, cheering it lustily; charming<br/>girls scaled it to get his autograph; interviews appeared in the<br/>better class of papers, and society invited him to dinner and<br/>added, "Do come in the kennel."<br/><br/>On that eventful Thursday week, Mrs. Darling was in the<br/>night-nursery awaiting George's return home; a very sad-eyed woman.<br/>Now that we look at her closely and remember the gaiety of her in<br/>the old days, all gone now just because she has lost her babes, I<br/>find I won't be able to say nasty things about her after all. If<br/>she was too fond of her rubbishy children, she couldn't help it.<br/>Look at her in her chair, where she has fallen asleep. The corner<br/>of her mouth, where one looks first, is almost withered up. Her<br/>hand moves restlessly on her breast as if she had a pain there.<br/>Some like Peter best, and some like Wendy best, but I like her<br/>best. Suppose, to make her happy, we whisper to her in her sleep<br/>that the brats are coming back. They are really within two miles of<br/>the window now, and flying strong, but all we need whisper is that<br/>they are on the way. Let's.<br/><br/>It is a pity we did it, for she has started up, calling their<br/>names; and there is no one in the room but Nana.<br/><br/>"O Nana, I dreamt my dear ones had come back."<br/><br/>Nana had filmy eyes, but all she could do was put her paw gently<br/>on her mistress's lap; and they were sitting together thus when the<br/>kennel was brought back. As Mr. Darling puts his head out to kiss<br/>his wife, we see that his face is more worn than of yore, but has a<br/>softer expression.<br/><br/>He gave his hat to Liza, who took it scornfully; for she had no<br/>imagination, and was quite incapable of understanding the motives<br/>of such a man. Outside, the crowd who had accompanied the cab home<br/>were still cheering, and he was naturally not unmoved.<br/><br/>"Listen to them," he said; "it is very gratifying."<br/><br/>"Lots of little boys," sneered Liza.<br/><br/>"There were several adults to-day," he assured her with a faint<br/>flush; but when she tossed her head he had not a word of reproof<br/>for her. Social success had not spoilt him; it had made him<br/>sweeter. For some time he sat with his head out of the kennel,<br/>talking with Mrs. Darling of this success, and pressing her hand<br/>reassuringly when she said she hoped his head would not be turned<br/>by it.<br/><br/>"But if I had been a weak man," he said. "Good heavens, if I had<br/>been a weak man!"<br/><br/>"And, George," she said timidly, "you are as full of remorse as<br/>ever, aren't you?"<br/>
