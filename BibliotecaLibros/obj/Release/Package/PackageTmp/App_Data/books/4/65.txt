"She is dead," he said uncomfortably. "Perhaps she is frightened
at being dead."

He thought of hopping off in a comic sort of way till he was out
of sight of her, and then never going near the spot any more. They
would all have been glad to follow if he had done this.

But there was the arrow. He took it from her heart and faced his
band.

"Whose arrow?" he demanded sternly.

"Mine, Peter," said Tootles on his knees.

"Oh, dastard hand," Peter said, and he raised the arrow to use
it as a dagger.

Tootles did not flinch. He bared his breast. "Strike, Peter," he
said firmly, "strike true."

Twice did Peter raise the arrow, and twice did his hand fall. "I
cannot strike," he said with awe, "there is something stays my
hand."

All looked at him in wonder, save Nibs, who fortunately looked
at Wendy.

"It is she," he cried, "the Wendy lady, see, her arm!"
