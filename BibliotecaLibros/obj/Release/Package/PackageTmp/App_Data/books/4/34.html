John rubbed his eyes. "Then I shall get up," he said. Of course<br/>he was on the floor already. "Hallo," he said, "I am up!"<br/><br/>Michael was up by this time also, looking as sharp as a knife<br/>with six blades and a saw, but Peter suddenly signed silence. Their<br/>faces assumed the awful craftiness of children listening for sounds<br/>from the grown-up world. All was as still as salt. Then everything<br/>was right. No, stop! Everything was wrong. Nana, who had been<br/>barking distressfully all the evening, was quiet now. It was her<br/>silence they had heard.<br/><br/>"Out with the light! Hide! Quick!" cried John, taking command<br/>for the only time throughout the whole adventure. And thus when<br/>Liza entered, holding Nana, the nursery seemed quite its old self,<br/>very dark, and you would have sworn you heard its three wicked<br/>inmates breathing angelically as they slept. They were really doing<br/>it artfully from behind the window curtains.<br/><br/>Liza was in a bad temper, for she was mixing the Christmas<br/>puddings in the kitchen, and had been drawn from them, with a<br/>raisin still on her cheek, by Nana's absurd suspicions. She thought<br/>the best way of getting a little quiet was to take Nana to the<br/>nursery for a moment, but in custody of course.<br/><br/>"There, you suspicious brute," she said, not sorry that Nana was<br/>in disgrace. "They are perfectly safe, aren't they? Every one of<br/>the little angels sound asleep in bed. Listen to their gentle<br/>breathing."<br/><br/>Here Michael, encouraged by his success, breathed so loudly that<br/>they were nearly detected. Nana knew that kind of breathing, and<br/>she tried to drag herself out of Liza's clutches.<br/><br/>But Liza was dense. "No more of it, Nana," she said sternly,<br/>pulling her out of the room. "I warn you if bark again I shall go<br/>straight for master and missus and bring them home from the party,<br/>and then, oh, won't master whip you, just."<br/><br/>She tied the unhappy dog up again, but do you think Nana ceased<br/>to bark? Bring master and missus home from the party! Why, that was<br/>just what she wanted. Do you think she cared whether she was<br/>whipped so long as her charges were safe? Unfortunately Liza<br/>returned to her puddings, and Nana, seeing that no help would come<br/>from her, strained and strained at the chain until at last she<br/>broke it. In another moment she had burst into the dining-room of<br/>27 and flung up her paws to heaven, her most expressive way of<br/>making a communication. Mr. and Mrs. Darling knew at once that<br/>something terrible was happening in their nursery, and without a<br/>good-bye to their hostess they rushed into the street.<br/><br/>But it was now ten minutes since three scoundrels had been<br/>breathing behind the curtains, and Peter Pan can do a great deal in<br/>ten minutes.<br/><br/>We now return to the nursery.<br/><br/>"It's all right," John announced, emerging from his<br/>hiding-place. "I say, Peter, can you really fly?"<br/>
