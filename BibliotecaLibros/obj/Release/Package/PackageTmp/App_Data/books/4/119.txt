"She says she won't!" Nibs exclaimed, aghast at such
insubordination, whereupon Peter went sternly toward the young
lady's chamber.

"Tink," he rapped out, "if you don't get up and dress at once I
will open the curtains, and then we shall all see you in your
negligee [nightgown]."

This made her leap to the floor. "Who said I wasn't getting up?"
she cried.

In the meantime the boys were gazing very forlornly at Wendy,
now equipped with John and Michael for the journey. By this time
they were dejected, not merely because they were about to lose her,
but also because they felt that she was going off to something nice
to which they had not been invited. Novelty was beckoning to them
as usual.

Crediting them with a nobler feeling Wendy melted.

"Dear ones," she said, "if you will all come with me I feel
almost sure I can get my father and mother to adopt you."

The invitation was meant specially for Peter, but each of the
boys was thinking exclusively of himself, and at once they jumped
with joy.

"But won't they think us rather a handful?" Nibs asked in the
middle of his jump.

"Oh no," said Wendy, rapidly thinking it out, "it will only mean
having a few beds in the drawing-room; they can be hidden behind
the screens on first Thursdays."

"Peter, can we go?" they all cried imploringly. They took it for
granted that if they went he would go also, but really they
scarcely cared. Thus children are ever ready, when novelty knocks,
to desert their dearest ones.
