<br/>"But he does so need a mother."<br/><br/>"So do you, my love."<br/><br/>"Oh, all right," Peter said, as if he had asked her from<br/>politeness merely; but Mrs. Darling saw his mouth twitch, and she<br/>made this handsome offer: to let Wendy go to him for a week every<br/>year to do his spring cleaning. Wendy would have preferred a more<br/>permanent arrangement; and it seemed to her that spring would be<br/>long in coming; but this promise sent Peter away quite gay again.<br/>He had no sense of time, and was so full of adventures that all I<br/>have told you about him is only a halfpenny-worth of them. I<br/>suppose it was because Wendy knew this that her last words to him<br/>were these rather plaintive ones:<br/><br/>"You won't forget me, Peter, will you, before spring cleaning<br/>time comes?"<br/><br/>Of course Peter promised; and then he flew away. He took Mrs.<br/>Darling's kiss with him. The kiss that had been for no one else,<br/>Peter took quite easily. Funny. But she seemed satisfied.<br/><br/>Of course all the boys went to school; and most of them got into<br/>Class III, but Slightly was put first into Class IV and then into<br/>Class V. Class I is the top class. Before they had attended school<br/>a week they saw what goats they had been not to remain on the<br/>island; but it was too late now, and soon they settled down to<br/>being as ordinary as you or me or Jenkins minor [the younger<br/>Jenkins]. It is sad to have to say that the power to fly gradually<br/>left them. At first Nana tied their feet to the bed-posts so that<br/>they should not fly away in the night; and one of their diversions<br/>by day was to pretend to fall off buses [the English<br/>double-deckers]; but by and by they ceased to tug at their bonds in<br/>bed, and found that they hurt themselves when they let go of the<br/>bus. In time they could not even fly after their hats. Want of<br/>practice, they called it; but what it really meant was that they no<br/>longer believed.<br/><br/>Michael believed longer than the other boys, though they jeered<br/>at him; so he was with Wendy when Peter came for her at the end of<br/>the first year. She flew away with Peter in the frock she had woven<br/>from leaves and berries in the Neverland, and her one fear was that<br/>he might notice how short it had become; but he never noticed, he<br/>had so much to say about himself.<br/><br/>She had looked forward to thrilling talks with him about old<br/>times, but new adventures had crowded the old ones from his<br/>mind.<br/><br/>"Who is Captain Hook?" he asked with interest when she spoke of<br/>the arch enemy.<br/><br/>"Don't you remember," she asked, amazed, "how you killed him and<br/>saved all our lives?"<br/><br/>
