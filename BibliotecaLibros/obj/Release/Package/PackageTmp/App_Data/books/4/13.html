"How wildly we romped!" says Mrs. Darling now, recalling it.<br/><br/>"Our last romp!" Mr. Darling groaned.<br/><br/>"O George, do you remember Michael suddenly said to me, 'How did<br/>you get to know me, mother?'"<br/><br/>"I remember!"<br/><br/>"They were rather sweet, don't you think, George?"<br/><br/>"And they were ours, ours! and now they are gone."<br/><br/>The romp had ended with the appearance of Nana, and most<br/>unluckily Mr. Darling collided against her, covering his trousers<br/>with hairs. They were not only new trousers, but they were the<br/>first he had ever had with braid on them, and he had had to bite<br/>his lip to prevent the tears coming. Of course Mrs. Darling brushed<br/>him, but he began to talk again about its being a mistake to have a<br/>dog for a nurse.<br/><br/>"George, Nana is a treasure."<br/><br/>"No doubt, but I have an uneasy feeling at times that she looks<br/>upon the children as puppies."<br/><br/>"Oh no, dear one, I feel sure she knows they have souls."<br/><br/>"I wonder," Mr. Darling said thoughtfully, "I wonder." It was an<br/>opportunity, his wife felt, for telling him about the boy. At first<br/>he pooh-poohed the story, but he became thoughtful when she showed<br/>him the shadow.<br/>
