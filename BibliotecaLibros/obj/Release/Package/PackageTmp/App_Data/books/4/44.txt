It came as the arrows went, leaving the island in gloom.

In the old days at home the Neverland had always begun to look a
little dark and threatening by bedtime. Then unexplored patches
arose in it and spread, black shadows moved about in them, the roar
of the beasts of prey was quite different now, and above all, you
lost the certainty that you would win. You were quite glad that the
night-lights were on. You even liked Nana to say that this was just
the mantelpiece over here, and that the Neverland was all
make-believe.

Of course the Neverland had been make-believe in those days, but
it was real now, and there were no night-lights, and it was getting
darker every moment, and where was Nana?

They had been flying apart, but they huddled close to Peter now.
His careless manner had gone at last, his eyes were sparkling, and
a tingle went through them every time they touched his body. They
were now over the fearsome island, flying so low that sometimes a
tree grazed their feet. Nothing horrid was visible in the air, yet
their progress had become slow and laboured, exactly as if they
were pushing their way through hostile forces. Sometimes they hung
in the air until Peter had beaten on it with his fists.

"They don't want us to land," he explained.

"Who are they?" Wendy whispered, shuddering.

But he could not or would not say. Tinker Bell had been asleep
on his shoulder, but now he wakened her and sent her on in
front.

Sometimes he poised himself in the air, listening intently, with
his hand to his ear, and again he would stare down with eyes so
bright that they seemed to bore two holes to earth. Having done
these things, he went on again.

His courage was almost appalling. "Would you like an adventure
now," he said casually to John, "or would you like to have your tea
first?"

Wendy said "tea first" quickly, and Michael pressed her hand in
gratitude, but the braver John hesitated.
