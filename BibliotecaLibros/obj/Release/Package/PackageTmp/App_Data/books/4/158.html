They<br/>alighted on the floor, quite unashamed of themselves, and the<br/>youngest one had already forgotten his home.<br/><br/>"John," he said, looking around him doubtfully, "I think I have<br/>been here before."<br/><br/>"Of course you have, you silly. There is your old bed."<br/><br/>"So it is," Michael said, but not with much conviction.<br/><br/>"I say," cried John, "the kennel!" and he dashed across to look<br/>into it.<br/><br/>"Perhaps Nana is inside it," Wendy said.<br/><br/>But John whistled. "Hullo," he said, "there's a man inside<br/>it."<br/><br/>"It's father!" exclaimed Wendy.<br/><br/>"Let me see father," Michael begged eagerly, and he took a good<br/>look. "He is not so big as the pirate I killed," he said with such<br/>frank disappointment that I am glad Mr. Darling was asleep; it<br/>would have been sad if those had been the first words he heard his<br/>little Michael say.<br/><br/>Wendy and John had been taken aback somewhat at finding their<br/>father in the kennel.<br/><br/>
