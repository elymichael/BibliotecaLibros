I don't know whether you have ever seen a map of a person's<br/>mind. Doctors sometimes draw maps of other parts of you, and your<br/>own map can become intensely interesting, but catch them trying to<br/>draw a map of a child's mind, which is not only confused, but keeps<br/>going round all the time. There are zigzag lines on it, just like<br/>your temperature on a card, and these are probably roads in the<br/>island, for the Neverland is always more or less an island, with<br/>astonishing splashes of colour here and there, and coral reefs and<br/>rakish-looking craft in the offing, and savages and lonely lairs,<br/>and gnomes who are mostly tailors, and caves through which a river<br/>runs, and princes with six elder brothers, and a hut fast going to<br/>decay, and one very small old lady with a hooked nose. It would be<br/>an easy map if that were all, but there is also first day at<br/>school, religion, fathers, the round pond, needle-work, murders,<br/>hangings, verbs that take the dative, chocolate pudding day,<br/>getting into braces, say ninety-nine, three-pence for pulling out<br/>your tooth yourself, and so on, and either these are part of the<br/>island or they are another map showing through, and it is all<br/>rather confusing, especially as nothing will stand still.<br/><br/>Of course the Neverlands vary a good deal. John's, for instance,<br/>had a lagoon with flamingoes flying over it at which John was<br/>shooting, while Michael, who was very small, had a flamingo with<br/>lagoons flying over it. John lived in a boat turned upside down on<br/>the sands, Michael in a wigwam, Wendy in a house of leaves deftly<br/>sewn together. John had no friends, Michael had friends at night,<br/>Wendy had a pet wolf forsaken by its parents, but on the whole the<br/>Neverlands have a family resemblance, and if they stood still in a<br/>row you could say of them that they have each other's nose, and so<br/>forth. On these magic shores children at play are for ever beaching<br/>their coracles [simple boat]. We too have been there; we can still<br/>hear the sound of the surf, though we shall land no more.<br/><br/>Of all delectable islands the Neverland is the snuggest and most<br/>compact, not large and sprawly, you know, with tedious distances<br/>between one adventure and another, but nicely crammed. When you<br/>play at it by day with the chairs and table-cloth, it is not in the<br/>least alarming, but in the two minutes before you go to sleep it<br/>becomes very real. That is why there are night-lights.<br/><br/>Occasionally in her travels through her children's minds Mrs.<br/>Darling found things she could not understand, and of these quite<br/>the most perplexing was the word Peter. She knew of no Peter, and<br/>yet he was here and there in John and Michael's minds, while<br/>Wendy's began to be scrawled all over with him. The name stood out<br/>in bolder letters than any of the other words, and as Mrs. Darling<br/>gazed she felt that it had an oddly cocky appearance.<br/><br/>"Yes, he is rather cocky," Wendy admitted with regret. Her<br/>mother had been questioning her.<br/><br/>"But who is he, my pet?"<br/><br/>"He is Peter Pan, you know, mother."<br/><br/>At first Mrs. Darling did not know, but after thinking back into<br/>her childhood she just remembered a Peter Pan who was said to live<br/>with the fairies. There were odd stories about him, as that when<br/>children died he went part of the way with them, so that they<br/>should not be frightened. She had believed in him at the time, but<br/>now that she was married and full of sense she quite doubted<br/>whether there was any such person.<br/><br/>"Besides," she said to Wendy, "he would be grown up by this<br/>time."<br/><br/>"Oh no, he isn't grown up," Wendy assured her confidently, "and<br/>he is just my size." She meant that he was her size in both mind<br/>and body; she didn't know how she knew, she just knew it.<br/><br/>Mrs. Darling consulted Mr. Darling, but he smiled pooh-pooh.<br/>"Mark my words," he said, "it is some nonsense Nana has been<br/>putting into their heads; just the sort of idea a dog would have.<br/>Leave it alone, and it will blow over."<br/>
