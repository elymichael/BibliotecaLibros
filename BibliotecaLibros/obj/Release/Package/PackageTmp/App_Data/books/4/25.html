<br/>"Yes, I do."<br/><br/>"I think it's perfectly sweet of you," she declared, "and I'll<br/>get up again," and she sat with him on the side of the bed. She<br/>also said she would give him a kiss if he liked, but Peter did not<br/>know what she meant, and he held out his hand expectantly.<br/><br/>"Surely you know what a kiss is?" she asked, aghast.<br/><br/>"I shall know when you give it to me," he replied stiffly, and<br/>not to hurt his feeling she gave him a thimble.<br/><br/>"Now," said he, "shall I give you a kiss?" and she replied with<br/>a slight primness, "If you please." She made herself rather cheap<br/>by inclining her face toward him, but he merely dropped an acorn<br/>button into her hand, so she slowly returned her face to where it<br/>had been before, and said nicely that she would wear his kiss on<br/>the chain around her neck. It was lucky that she did put it on that<br/>chain, for it was afterwards to save her life.<br/><br/>When people in our set are introduced, it is customary for them<br/>to ask each other's age, and so Wendy, who always liked to do the<br/>correct thing, asked Peter how old he was. It was not really a<br/>happy question to ask him; it was like an examination paper that<br/>asks grammar, when what you want to be asked is Kings of<br/>England.<br/><br/>"I don't know," he replied uneasily, "but I am quite young." He<br/>really knew nothing about it, he had merely suspicions, but he said<br/>at a venture, "Wendy, I ran away the day I was born."<br/><br/>Wendy was quite surprised, but interested; and she indicated in<br/>the charming drawing-room manner, by a touch on her night-gown,<br/>that he could sit nearer her.<br/><br/>"It was because I heard father and mother," he explained in a<br/>low voice, "talking about what I was to be when I became a man." He<br/>was extraordinarily agitated now. "I don't want ever to be a man,"<br/>he said with passion. "I want always to be a little boy and to have<br/>fun. So I ran away to Kensington Gardens and lived a long long time<br/>among the fairies."<br/><br/>She gave him a look of the most intense admiration, and he<br/>thought it was because he had run away, but it was really because<br/>he knew fairies. Wendy had lived such a home life that to know<br/>fairies struck her as quite delightful. She poured out questions<br/>about them, to his surprise, for they were rather a nuisance to<br/>him, getting in his way and so on, and indeed he sometimes had to<br/>give them a hiding [spanking]. Still, he liked them on the whole,<br/>and he told her about the beginning of fairies.<br/><br/>
