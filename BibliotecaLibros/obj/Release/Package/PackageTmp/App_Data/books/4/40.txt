Certainly they did not pretend to be sleepy, they were sleepy;
and that was a danger, for the moment they popped off, down they
fell. The awful thing was that Peter thought this funny.

"There he goes again!" he would cry gleefully, as Michael
suddenly dropped like a stone.

"Save him, save him!" cried Wendy, looking with horror at the
cruel sea far below. Eventually Peter would dive through the air,
and catch Michael just before he could strike the sea, and it was
lovely the way he did it; but he always waited till the last
moment, and you felt it was his cleverness that interested him and
not the saving of human life. Also he was fond of variety, and the
sport that engrossed him one moment would suddenly cease to engage
him, so there was always the possibility that the next time you
fell he would let you go.

He could sleep in the air without falling, by merely lying on
his back and floating, but this was, partly at least, because he
was so light that if you got behind him and blew he went
faster.

"Do be more polite to him," Wendy whispered to John, when they
were playing "Follow my Leader."

"Then tell him to stop showing off," said John.

When playing Follow my Leader, Peter would fly close to the
water and touch each shark's tail in passing, just as in the street
you may run your finger along an iron railing. They could not
follow him in this with much success, so perhaps it was rather like
showing off, especially as he kept looking behind to see how many
tails they missed.

"You must be nice to him," Wendy impressed on her brothers.
"What could we do if he were to leave us!"

"We could go back," Michael said.

"How could we ever find our way back without him?"
