At last he cried, "Cleave him to the brisket!" but without<br/>conviction.<br/><br/>"Down, boys, and at them!" Peter's voice rang out; and in<br/>another moment the clash of arms was resounding through the ship.<br/>Had the pirates kept together it is certain that they would have<br/>won; but the onset came when they were still unstrung, and they ran<br/>hither and thither, striking wildly, each thinking himself the last<br/>survivor of the crew. Man to man they were the stronger; but they<br/>fought on the defensive only, which enabled the boys to hunt in<br/>pairs and choose their quarry. Some of the miscreants leapt into<br/>the sea; others hid in dark recesses, where they were found by<br/>Slightly, who did not fight, but ran about with a lantern which he<br/>flashed in their faces, so that they were half blinded and fell as<br/>an easy prey to the reeking swords of the other boys. There was<br/>little sound to be heard but the clang of weapons, an occasional<br/>screech or splash, and Slightly monotonously<br/>counting—five—six—seven eight—nine—ten—eleven.<br/><br/>I think all were gone when a group of savage boys surrounded<br/>Hook, who seemed to have a charmed life, as he kept them at bay in<br/>that circle of fire. They had done for his dogs, but this man alone<br/>seemed to be a match for them all. Again and again they closed upon<br/>him, and again and again he hewed a clear space. He had lifted up<br/>one boy with his hook, and was using him as a buckler [shield],<br/>when another, who had just passed his sword through Mullins, sprang<br/>into the fray.<br/><br/>"Put up your swords, boys," cried the newcomer, "this man is<br/>mine."<br/><br/>Thus suddenly Hook found himself face to face with Peter. The<br/>others drew back and formed a ring around them.<br/><br/>For long the two enemies looked at one another, Hook shuddering<br/>slightly, and Peter with the strange smile upon his face.<br/><br/>"So, Pan," said Hook at last, "this is all your doing."<br/><br/>"Ay, James Hook," came the stern answer, "it is all my<br/>doing."<br/><br/>"Proud and insolent youth," said Hook, "prepare to meet thy<br/>doom."<br/><br/>"Dark and sinister man," Peter answered, "have at thee."<br/><br/>Without more words they fell to, and for a space there was no<br/>advantage to either blade. Peter was a superb swordsman, and<br/>parried with dazzling rapidity; ever and anon he followed up a<br/>feint with a lunge that got past his foe's defence, but his shorter<br/>reach stood him in ill stead, and he could not drive the steel<br/>home. Hook, scarcely his inferior in brilliancy, but not quite so<br/>nimble in wrist play, forced him back by the weight of his onset,<br/>hoping suddenly to end all with a favourite thrust, taught him long<br/>ago by Barbecue at Rio; but to his astonishment he found this<br/>thrust turned aside again and again. Then he sought to close and<br/>give the quietus with his iron hook, which all this time had been<br/>pawing the air; but Peter doubled under it and, lunging fiercely,<br/>pierced him in the ribs. At the sight of his own blood, whose<br/>peculiar colour, you remember, was offensive to him, the sword fell<br/>from Hook's hand, and he was at Peter's mercy.<br/>
