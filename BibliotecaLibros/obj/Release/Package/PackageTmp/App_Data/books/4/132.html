Many clapped.<br/><br/>Some didn't.<br/><br/>A few beasts hissed.<br/><br/>The clapping stopped suddenly; as if countless mothers had<br/>rushed to their nurseries to see what on earth was happening; but<br/>already Tink was saved. First her voice grew strong, then she<br/>popped out of bed, then she was flashing through the room more<br/>merry and impudent than ever. She never thought of thanking those<br/>who believed, but she would have like to get at the ones who had<br/>hissed.<br/><br/>"And now to rescue Wendy!"<br/><br/>The moon was riding in a cloudy heaven when Peter rose from his<br/>tree, begirt [belted] with weapons and wearing little else, to set<br/>out upon his perilous quest. It was not such a night as he would<br/>have chosen. He had hoped to fly, keeping not far from the ground<br/>so that nothing unwonted should escape his eyes; but in that fitful<br/>light to have flown low would have meant trailing his shadow<br/>through the trees, thus disturbing birds and acquainting a watchful<br/>foe that he was astir.<br/><br/>He regretted now that he had given the birds of the island such<br/>strange names that they are very wild and difficult of<br/>approach.<br/><br/>There was no other course but to press forward in redskin<br/>fashion, at which happily he was an adept [expert]. But in what<br/>direction, for he could not be sure that the children had been<br/>taken to the ship? A light fall of snow had obliterated all<br/>footmarks; and a deathly silence pervaded the island, as if for a<br/>space Nature stood still in horror of the recent carnage. He had<br/>taught the children something of the forest lore that he had<br/>himself learned from Tiger Lily and Tinker Bell, and knew that in<br/>their dire hour they were not likely to forget it. Slightly, if he<br/>had an opportunity, would blaze [cut a mark in] the trees, for<br/>instance, Curly would drop seeds, and Wendy would leave her<br/>handkerchief at some important place. The morning was needed to<br/>search for such guidance, and he could not wait. The upper world<br/>had called him, but would give no help.<br/><br/>The crocodile passed him, but not another living thing, not a<br/>sound, not a movement; and yet he knew well that sudden death might<br/>be at the next tree, or stalking him from behind.<br/><br/>He swore this terrible oath: "Hook or me this time."<br/><br/>Now he crawled forward like a snake, and again erect, he darted<br/>across a space on which the moonlight played, one finger on his lip<br/>and his dagger at the ready. He was frightfully happy.<br/>
