"Did you hear them say Peter Pan's from home?" Smee whispered,<br/>fidgeting with Johnny Corkscrew.<br/><br/>Hook nodded. He stood for a long time lost in thought, and at<br/>last a curdling smile lit up his swarthy face. Smee had been<br/>waiting for it. "Unrip your plan, captain," he cried eagerly.<br/><br/>"To return to the ship," Hook replied slowly through his teeth,<br/>"and cook a large rich cake of a jolly thickness with green sugar<br/>on it. There can be but one room below, for there is but one<br/>chimney. The silly moles had not the sense to see that they did not<br/>need a door apiece. That shows they have no mother. We will leave<br/>the cake on the shore of the Mermaids' Lagoon. These boys are<br/>always swimming about there, playing with the mermaids. They will<br/>find the cake and they will gobble it up, because, having no<br/>mother, they don't know how dangerous 'tis to eat rich damp cake."<br/>He burst into laughter, not hollow laughter now, but honest<br/>laughter. "Aha, they will die."<br/><br/>Smee had listened with growing admiration.<br/><br/>"It's the wickedest, prettiest policy ever I heard of!" he<br/>cried, and in their exultation they danced and sang:<br/><br/><br/>"Avast, belay, when I appear,<br/>By fear they're overtook;<br/>Nought's left upon your bones when you<br/>Have shaken claws with Hook."<br/><br/><br/>They began the verse, but they never finished it, for another<br/>sound broke in and stilled them. There was at first such a tiny<br/>sound that a leaf might have fallen on it and smothered it, but as<br/>it came nearer it was more distinct.<br/><br/>Tick tick tick tick!<br/><br/>
