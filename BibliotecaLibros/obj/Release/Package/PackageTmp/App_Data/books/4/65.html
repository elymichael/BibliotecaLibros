"Perhaps she is frightened<br/>at being dead."<br/><br/>He thought of hopping off in a comic sort of way till he was out<br/>of sight of her, and then never going near the spot any more. They<br/>would all have been glad to follow if he had done this.<br/><br/>But there was the arrow. He took it from her heart and faced his<br/>band.<br/><br/>"Whose arrow?" he demanded sternly.<br/><br/>"Mine, Peter," said Tootles on his knees.<br/><br/>"Oh, dastard hand," Peter said, and he raised the arrow to use<br/>it as a dagger.<br/><br/>Tootles did not flinch. He bared his breast. "Strike, Peter," he<br/>said firmly, "strike true."<br/><br/>Twice did Peter raise the arrow, and twice did his hand fall.
