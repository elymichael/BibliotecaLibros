When at last the heavens were steady again, John and Michael<br/>found themselves alone in the darkness. John was treading the air<br/>mechanically, and Michael without knowing how to float was<br/>floating.<br/><br/>"Are you shot?" John whispered tremulously.<br/><br/>"I haven't tried [myself out] yet," Michael whispered back.<br/><br/>We know now that no one had been hit. Peter, however, had been<br/>carried by the wind of the shot far out to sea, while Wendy was<br/>blown upwards with no companion but Tinker Bell.<br/><br/>It would have been well for Wendy if at that moment she had<br/>dropped the hat.<br/><br/>I don't know whether the idea came suddenly to Tink, or whether<br/>she had planned it on the way, but she at once popped out of the<br/>hat and began to lure Wendy to her destruction.<br/><br/>Tink was not all bad; or, rather, she was all bad just now, but,<br/>on the other hand, sometimes she was all good. Fairies have to be<br/>one thing or the other, because being so small they unfortunately<br/>have room for one feeling only at a time. They are, however,<br/>allowed to change, only it must be a complete change. At present<br/>she was full of jealousy of Wendy. What she said in her lovely<br/>tinkle Wendy could not of course understand, and I believe some of<br/>it was bad words, but it sounded kind, and she flew back and<br/>forward, plainly meaning "Follow me, and all will be well."<br/><br/>What else could poor Wendy do? She called to Peter and John and<br/>Michael, and got only mocking echoes in reply. She did not yet know<br/>that Tink hated her with the fierce hatred of a very woman. And so,<br/>bewildered, and now staggering in her flight, she followed Tink to<br/>her doom.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
