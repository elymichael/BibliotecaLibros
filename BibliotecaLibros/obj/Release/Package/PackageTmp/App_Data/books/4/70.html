"Please, sir," said Peter, going to him, "are you a doctor?"<br/><br/>The difference between him and the other boys at such a time was<br/>that they knew it was make-believe, while to him make-believe and<br/>true were exactly the same thing. This sometimes troubled them, as<br/>when they had to make-believe that they had had their dinners.<br/><br/>If they broke down in their make-believe he rapped them on the<br/>knuckles.<br/><br/>"Yes, my little man," Slightly anxiously replied, who had<br/>chapped knuckles.<br/><br/>"Please, sir," Peter explained, "a lady lies very ill."<br/><br/>She was lying at their feet, but Slightly had the sense not to<br/>see her.<br/><br/>"Tut, tut, tut," he said, "where does she lie?"<br/><br/>"In yonder glade."<br/><br/>"I will put a glass thing in her mouth," said Slightly, and he<br/>made-believe to do it, while Peter waited. It was an anxious moment<br/>when the glass thing was withdrawn.<br/><br/>"How is she?" inquired Peter.<br/><br/>"Tut, tut, tut," said Slightly, "this has cured her."<br/>
