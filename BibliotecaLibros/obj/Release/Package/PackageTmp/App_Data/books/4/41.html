"Well, then, we could go on," said John.<br/><br/>"That is the awful thing, John. We should have to go on, for we<br/>don't know how to stop."<br/><br/>This was true, Peter had forgotten to show them how to stop.<br/><br/>John said that if the worst came to the worst, all they had to<br/>do was to go straight on, for the world was round, and so in time<br/>they must come back to their own window.<br/><br/>"And who is to get food for us, John?"<br/><br/>"I nipped a bit out of that eagle's mouth pretty neatly,<br/>Wendy."<br/><br/>"After the twentieth try," Wendy reminded him. "And even though<br/>we became good a picking up food, see how we bump against clouds<br/>and things if he is not near to give us a hand."<br/><br/>Indeed they were constantly bumping. They could now fly<br/>strongly, though they still kicked far too much; but if they saw a<br/>cloud in front of them, the more they tried to avoid it, the more<br/>certainly did they bump into it. If Nana had been with them, she<br/>would have had a bandage round Michael's forehead by this time.<br/><br/>Peter was not with them for the moment, and they felt rather<br/>lonely up there by themselves. He could go so much faster than they<br/>that he would suddenly shoot out of sight, to have some adventure<br/>in which they had no share. He would come down laughing over<br/>something fearfully funny he had been saying to a star, but he had<br/>already forgotten what it was, or he would come up with mermaid<br/>scales still sticking to him, and yet not be able to say for<br/>certain what had been happening. It was really rather irritating to<br/>children who had never seen a mermaid.<br/><br/>"And if he forgets them so quickly," Wendy argued, "how can we<br/>expect that he will go on remembering us?"<br/><br/>Indeed, sometimes when he returned he did not remember them, at<br/>least not well. Wendy was sure of it. She saw recognition come into<br/>his eyes as he was about to pass them the time of day and go on;<br/>once even she had to call him by name.<br/>
