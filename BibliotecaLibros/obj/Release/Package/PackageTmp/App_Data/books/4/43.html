"I say, John, I see your flamingo with the broken leg!"<br/><br/>"Look, Michael, there's your cave!"<br/><br/>"John, what's that in the brushwood?"<br/><br/>"It's a wolf with her whelps. Wendy, I do believe that's your<br/>little whelp!"<br/><br/>"There's my boat, John, with her sides stove in!"<br/><br/>"No, it isn't. Why, we burned your boat."<br/><br/>"That's her, at any rate. I say, John, I see the smoke of the<br/>redskin camp!"<br/><br/>"Where? Show me, and I'll tell you by the way smoke curls<br/>whether they are on the war-path."<br/><br/>"There, just across the Mysterious River."<br/><br/>"I see now. Yes, they are on the war-path right enough."<br/><br/>Peter was a little annoyed with them for knowing so much, but if<br/>he wanted to lord it over them his triumph was at hand, for have I<br/>not told you that anon fear fell upon them?<br/>
