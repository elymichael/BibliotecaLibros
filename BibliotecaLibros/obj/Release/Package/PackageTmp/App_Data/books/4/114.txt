"I don't see how it can have a happy ending," said the second
twin. "Do you, Nibs?"

"I'm frightfully anxious."

"If you knew how great is a mother's love," Wendy told them
triumphantly, "you would have no fear." She had now come to the
part that Peter hated.

"I do like a mother's love," said Tootles, hitting Nibs with a
pillow. "Do you like a mother's love, Nibs?"

"I do just," said Nibs, hitting back.

"You see," Wendy said complacently, "our heroine knew that the
mother would always leave the window open for her children to fly
back by; so they stayed away for years and had a lovely time."

"Did they ever go back?"

"Let us now," said Wendy, bracing herself up for her finest
effort, "take a peep into the future;" and they all gave themselves
the twist that makes peeps into the future easier. "Years have
rolled by, and who is this elegant lady of uncertain age alighting
at London Station?"

"O Wendy, who is she?" cried Nibs, every bit as excited as if he
didn't know.

"Can it be—yes—no—it is—the fair Wendy!"

"Oh!"
