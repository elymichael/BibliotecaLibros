9
THE NEVER BIRD


The last sound Peter heard before he was quite alone were the
mermaids retiring one by one to their bedchambers under the sea. He
was too far away to hear their doors shut; but every door in the
coral caves where they live rings a tiny bell when it opens or
closes (as in all the nicest houses on the mainland), and he heard
the bells.

Steadily the waters rose till they were nibbling at his feet;
and to pass the time until they made their final gulp, he watched
the only thing on the lagoon. He thought it was a piece of floating
paper, perhaps part of the kite, and wondered idly how long it
would take to drift ashore.

Presently he noticed as an odd thing that it was undoubtedly out
upon the lagoon with some definite purpose, for it was fighting the
tide, and sometimes winning; and when it won, Peter, always
sympathetic to the weaker side, could not help clapping; it was
such a gallant piece of paper.

It was not really a piece of paper; it was the Never bird,
making desperate efforts to reach Peter on the nest. By working her
wings, in a way she had learned since the nest fell into the water,
she was able to some extent to guide her strange craft, but by the
time Peter recognised her she was very exhausted. She had come to
save him, to give him her nest, though there were eggs in it. I
rather wonder at the bird, for though he had been nice to her, he
had also sometimes tormented her. I can suppose only that, like
Mrs. Darling and the rest of them, she was melted because he had
all his first teeth.

She called out to him what she had come for, and he called out
to her what she was doing there; but of course neither of them
understood the other's language. In fanciful stories people can
talk to the birds freely, and I wish for the moment I could pretend
that this were such a story, and say that Peter replied
intelligently to the Never bird; but truth is best, and I want to
tell you only what really happened. Well, not only could they not
understand each other, but they forgot their manners.

"I—want—you—to—get—into—the—nest," the bird called, speaking as
slowly and distinctly as possible, "and—then—you—can—drift—ashore,
but—I—am—too—tired—to—bring—it—any—nearer—so—you—must—try
to—swim—to—it."

"What are you quacking about?" Peter answered. "Why don't you
let the nest drift as usual?"
