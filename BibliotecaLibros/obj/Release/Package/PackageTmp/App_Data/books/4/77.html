<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>7<br/>THE HOME UNDER THE GROUND<br/><br/><br/>One of the first things Peter did next day was to measure Wendy<br/>and John and Michael for hollow trees. Hook, you remember, had<br/>sneered at the boys for thinking they needed a tree apiece, but<br/>this was ignorance, for unless your tree fitted you it was<br/>difficult to go up and down, and no two of the boys were quite the<br/>same size. Once you fitted, you drew in [let out] your breath at<br/>the top, and down you went at exactly the right speed, while to<br/>ascend you drew in and let out alternately, and so wriggled up. Of<br/>course, when you have mastered the action you are able to do these<br/>things without thinking of them, and nothing can be more<br/>graceful.<br/><br/>But you simply must fit, and Peter measures you for your tree as<br/>carefully as for a suit of clothes: the only difference being that<br/>the clothes are made to fit you, while you have to be made to fit<br/>the tree. Usually it is done quite easily, as by your wearing too<br/>many garments or too few, but if you are bumpy in awkward places or<br/>the only available tree is an odd shape, Peter does some things to<br/>you, and after that you fit. Once you fit, great care must be taken<br/>to go on fitting, and this, as Wendy was to discover to her<br/>delight, keeps a whole family in perfect condition.<br/><br/>Wendy and Michael fitted their trees at the first try, but John<br/>had to be altered a little.<br/><br/>After a few days' practice they could go up and down as gaily as<br/>buckets in a well. And how ardently they grew to love their home<br/>under the ground; especially Wendy. It consisted of one large room,<br/>as all houses should do, with a floor in which you could dig [for<br/>worms] if you wanted to go fishing, and in this floor grew stout<br/>mushrooms of a charming colour, which were used as stools. A Never<br/>tree tried hard to grow in the centre of the room, but every<br/>morning they sawed the trunk through, level with the floor. By<br/>tea-time it was always about two feet high, and then they put a<br/>door on top of it, the whole thus becoming a table; as soon as they<br/>cleared away, they sawed off the trunk again, and thus there was<br/>more room to play. There was an enormous fireplace which was in<br/>almost any part of the room where you cared to light it, and across<br/>this Wendy stretched strings, made of fibre, from which she<br/>suspended her washing. The bed was tilted against the wall by day,<br/>and let down at 6:30, when it filled nearly half the room; and all<br/>the boys slept in it, except Michael, lying like sardines in a tin.<br/>There was a strict rule against turning round until one gave the<br/>signal, when all turned at once. Michael should have used it also,<br/>but Wendy would have [desired] a baby, and he was the littlest, and<br/>you know what women are, and the short and long of it is that he<br/>was hung up in a basket.<br/><br/>It was rough and simple, and not unlike what baby bears would<br/>have made of an underground house in the same circumstances. But<br/>there was one recess in the wall, no larger than a bird-cage, which<br/>was the private apartment of Tinker Bell. It could be shut off from<br/>the rest of the house by a tiny curtain, which Tink, who was most<br/>fastidious [particular], always kept drawn when dressing or<br/>undressing. No woman, however large, could have had a more<br/>exquisite boudoir [dressing room] and bed-chamber combined. The<br/>couch, as she always called it, was a genuine Queen Mab, with club<br/>legs; and she varied the bedspreads according to what fruit-blossom<br/>was in season. Her mirror was a Puss-in-Boots, of which there are<br/>now only three, unchipped, known to fairy dealers; the washstand<br/>was Pie-crust and reversible, the chest of drawers an authentic<br/>Charming the Sixth, and the carpet and rugs the best (the early)<br/>period of Margery and Robin. There was a chandelier from<br/>Tiddlywinks for the look of the thing, but of course she lit the<br/>residence herself. Tink was very contemptuous of the rest of the<br/>house, as indeed was perhaps inevitable, and her chamber, though<br/>beautiful, looked rather conceited, having the appearance of a nose<br/>permanently turned up.<br/><br/>I suppose it was all especially entrancing to Wendy, because<br/>those rampagious boys of hers gave her so much to do. Really there<br/>were whole weeks when, except perhaps with a stocking in the<br/>evening, she was never above ground. The cooking, I can tell you,<br/>kept her nose to the pot, and even if there was nothing in it, even<br/>if there was no pot, she had to keep watching that it came aboil<br/>just the same. You never exactly knew whether there would be a real<br/>meal or just a make-believe, it all depended upon Peter's whim: he<br/>could eat, really eat, if it was part of a game, but he could not<br/>stodge [cram down the food] just to feel stodgy [stuffed with<br/>food], which is what most children like better than anything else;<br/>the next best thing being to talk about it. Make-believe was so<br/>real to him that during a meal of it you could see him getting<br/>rounder. Of course it was trying, but you simply had to follow his<br/>lead, and if you could prove to him that you were getting loose for<br/>your tree he let you stodge.<br/><br/>Wendy's favourite time for sewing and darning was after they had<br/>all gone to bed. Then, as she expressed it, she had a breathing<br/>time for herself; and she occupied it in making new things for<br/>them, and putting double pieces on the knees, for they were all<br/>most frightfully hard on their knees.<br/>
