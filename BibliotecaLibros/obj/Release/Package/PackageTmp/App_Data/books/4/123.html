<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>12<br/>THE CHILDREN ARE CARRIED OFF<br/><br/><br/>The pirate attack had been a complete surprise: a sure proof<br/>that the unscrupulous Hook had conducted it improperly, for to<br/>surprise redskins fairly is beyond the wit of the white man.<br/><br/>By all the unwritten laws of savage warfare it is always the<br/>redskin who attacks, and with the wiliness of his race he does it<br/>just before the dawn, at which time he knows the courage of the<br/>whites to be at its lowest ebb. The white men have in the meantime<br/>made a rude stockade on the summit of yonder undulating ground, at<br/>the foot of which a stream runs, for it is destruction to be too<br/>far from water. There they await the onslaught, the inexperienced<br/>ones clutching their revolvers and treading on twigs, but the old<br/>hands sleeping tranquilly until just before the dawn. Through the<br/>long black night the savage scouts wriggle, snake-like, among the<br/>grass without stirring a blade. The brushwood closes behind them,<br/>as silently as sand into which a mole has dived. Not a sound is to<br/>be heard, save when they give vent to a wonderful imitation of the<br/>lonely call of the coyote. The cry is answered by other braves; and<br/>some of them do it even better than the coyotes, who are not very<br/>good at it. So the chill hours wear on, and the long suspense is<br/>horribly trying to the paleface who has to live through it for the<br/>first time; but to the trained hand those ghastly calls and still<br/>ghastlier silences are but an intimation of how the night is<br/>marching.<br/><br/>That this was the usual procedure was so well known to Hook that<br/>in disregarding it he cannot be excused on the plea of<br/>ignorance.<br/><br/>The Piccaninnies, on their part, trusted implicitly to his<br/>honour, and their whole action of the night stands out in marked<br/>contrast to his. They left nothing undone that was consistent with<br/>the reputation of their tribe. With that alertness of the senses<br/>which is at once the marvel and despair of civilised peoples, they<br/>knew that the pirates were on the island from the moment one of<br/>them trod on a dry stick; and in an incredibly short space of time<br/>the coyote cries began. Every foot of ground between the spot where<br/>Hook had landed his forces and the home under the trees was<br/>stealthily examined by braves wearing their mocassins with the<br/>heels in front. They found only one hillock with a stream at its<br/>base, so that Hook had no choice; here he must establish himself<br/>and wait for just before the dawn. Everything being thus mapped out<br/>with almost diabolical cunning, the main body of the redskins<br/>folded their blankets around them, and in the phlegmatic manner<br/>that is to them, the pearl of manhood squatted above the children's<br/>home, awaiting the cold moment when they should deal pale<br/>death.<br/><br/>Here dreaming, though wide-awake, of the exquisite tortures to<br/>which they were to put him at break of day, those confiding savages<br/>were found by the treacherous Hook. From the accounts afterwards<br/>supplied by such of the scouts as escaped the carnage, he does not<br/>seem even to have paused at the rising ground, though it is certain<br/>that in that grey light he must have seen it: no thought of waiting<br/>to be attacked appears from first to last to have visited his<br/>subtle mind; he would not even hold off till the night was nearly<br/>spent; on he pounded with no policy but to fall to [get into<br/>combat]. What could the bewildered scouts do, masters as they were<br/>of every war-like artifice save this one, but trot helplessly after<br/>him, exposing themselves fatally to view, while they gave pathetic<br/>utterance to the coyote cry.<br/><br/>Around the brave Tiger Lily were a dozen of her stoutest<br/>warriors, and they suddenly saw the perfidious pirates bearing down<br/>upon them. Fell from their eyes then the film through which they<br/>had looked at victory. No more would they torture at the stake. For<br/>them the happy hunting-grounds was now. They knew it; but as their<br/>father's sons they acquitted themselves. Even then they had time to<br/>gather in a phalanx [dense formation] that would have been hard to<br/>break had they risen quickly, but this they were forbidden to do by<br/>the traditions of their race. It is written that the noble savage<br/>must never express surprise in the presence of the white. Thus<br/>terrible as the sudden appearance of the pirates must have been to<br/>them, they remained stationary for a moment, not a muscle moving;<br/>as if the foe had come by invitation. Then, indeed, the tradition<br/>gallantly upheld, they seized their weapons, and the air was torn<br/>with the war-cry; but it was now too late.<br/><br/>It is no part of ours to describe what was a massacre rather<br/>than a fight. Thus perished many of the flower of the Piccaninny<br/>tribe. Not all unavenged did they die, for with Lean Wolf fell Alf<br/>Mason, to disturb the Spanish Main no more, and among others who<br/>bit the dust were Geo. Scourie, Chas. Turley, and the Alsatian<br/>Foggerty. Turley fell to the tomahawk of the terrible Panther, who<br/>ultimately cut a way through the pirates with Tiger Lily and a<br/>small remnant of the tribe.<br/>
