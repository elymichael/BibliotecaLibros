Five drops of this he now added to Peter's cup. His hand shook,
but it was in exultation rather than in shame. As he did it he
avoided glancing at the sleeper, but not lest pity should unnerve
him; merely to avoid spilling. Then one long gloating look he cast
upon his victim, and turning, wormed his way with difficulty up the
tree. As he emerged at the top he looked the very spirit of evil
breaking from its hole. Donning his hat at its most rakish angle,
he wound his cloak around him, holding one end in front as if to
conceal his person from the night, of which it was the blackest
part, and muttering strangely to himself, stole away through the
trees.

Peter slept on. The light guttered [burned to edges] and went
out, leaving the tenement in darkness; but still he slept. It must
have been not less than ten o'clock by the crocodile, when he
suddenly sat up in his bed, wakened by he knew not what. It was a
soft cautious tapping on the door of his tree.

Soft and cautious, but in that stillness it was sinister. Peter
felt for his dagger till his hand gripped it. Then he spoke.

"Who is that?"

For long there was no answer: then again the knock.

"Who are you?"

No answer.

He was thrilled, and he loved being thrilled. In two strides he
reached the door. Unlike Slightly's door, it filled the aperture
[opening], so that he could not see beyond it, nor could the one
knocking see him.

"I won't open unless you speak," Peter cried.

Then at last the visitor spoke, in a lovely bell-like voice.

"Let me in, Peter."
