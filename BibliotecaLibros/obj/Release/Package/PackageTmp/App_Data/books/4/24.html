But she was exulting in his ignorance. "I shall sew it on for<br/>you, my little man," she said, though he was tall as herself, and<br/>she got out her housewife [sewing bag], and sewed the shadow on to<br/>Peter's foot.<br/><br/>"I daresay it will hurt a little," she warned him.<br/><br/>"Oh, I shan't cry," said Peter, who was already of the opinion<br/>that he had never cried in his life. And he clenched his teeth and<br/>did not cry, and soon his shadow was behaving properly, though<br/>still a little creased.<br/><br/>"Perhaps I should have ironed it," Wendy said thoughtfully, but<br/>Peter, boylike, was indifferent to appearances, and he was now<br/>jumping about in the wildest glee. Alas, he had already forgotten<br/>that he owed his bliss to Wendy. He thought he had attached the<br/>shadow himself. "How clever I am!" he crowed rapturously, "oh, the<br/>cleverness of me!"<br/><br/>It is humiliating to have to confess that this conceit of Peter<br/>was one of his most fascinating qualities. To put it with brutal<br/>frankness, there never was a cockier boy.<br/><br/>But for the moment Wendy was shocked. "You conceit [braggart],"<br/>she exclaimed, with frightful sarcasm; "of course I did<br/>nothing!"<br/><br/>"You did a little," Peter said carelessly, and continued to<br/>dance.<br/><br/>"A little!" she replied with hauteur [pride]; "if I am no use I<br/>can at least withdraw," and she sprang in the most dignified way<br/>into bed and covered her face with the blankets.<br/><br/>To induce her to look up he pretended to be going away, and when<br/>this failed he sat on the end of the bed and tapped her gently with<br/>his foot. "Wendy," he said, "don't withdraw. I can't help crowing,<br/>Wendy, when I'm pleased with myself." Still she would not look up,<br/>though she was listening eagerly. "Wendy," he continued, in a voice<br/>that no woman has ever yet been able to resist, "Wendy, one girl is<br/>more use than twenty boys."<br/><br/>Now Wendy was every inch a woman, though there were not very<br/>many inches, and she peeped out of the bed-clothes.<br/><br/>"Do you really think so, Peter?"<br/>
