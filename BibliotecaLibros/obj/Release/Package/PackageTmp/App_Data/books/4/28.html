They were together in the armchair by this time, and Wendy plied<br/>him with more questions.<br/><br/>"If you don't live in Kensington Gardens nowâ€”"<br/><br/>"Sometimes I do still."<br/><br/>"But where do you live mostly now?"<br/><br/>"With the lost boys."<br/><br/>"Who are they?"<br/><br/>"They are the children who fall out of their perambulators when<br/>the nurse is looking the other way. If they are not claimed in<br/>seven days they are sent far away to the Neverland to defray<br/>expenses. I'm captain."<br/><br/>"What fun it must be!"<br/><br/>"Yes," said cunning Peter, "but we are rather lonely. You see we<br/>have no female companionship."<br/><br/>"Are none of the others girls?"<br/><br/>"Oh, no; girls, you know, are much too clever to fall out of<br/>their prams."<br/>
