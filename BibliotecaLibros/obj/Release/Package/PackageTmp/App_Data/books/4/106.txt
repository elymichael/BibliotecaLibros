"And mummy too."

"What," cried Wendy, "the mother of such an armful, dance!"

"But on a Saturday night," Slightly insinuated.

It was not really Saturday night, at least it may have been, for
they had long lost count of the days; but always if they wanted to
do anything special they said this was Saturday night, and then
they did it.

"Of course it is Saturday night, Peter," Wendy said,
relenting.

"People of our figure, Wendy!"

"But it is only among our own progeny [children]."

"True, true."

So they were told they could dance, but they must put on their
nighties first.

"Ah, old lady," Peter said aside to Wendy, warming himself by
the fire and looking down at her as she sat turning a heel, "there
is nothing more pleasant of an evening for you and me when the
day's toil is over than to rest by the fire with the little ones
near by."

"It is sweet, Peter, isn't it?" Wendy said, frightfully
gratified. "Peter, I think Curly has your nose."
