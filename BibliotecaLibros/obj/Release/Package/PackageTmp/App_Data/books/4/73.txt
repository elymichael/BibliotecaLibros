With a blow of their fists they made windows, and large yellow

"Roses," cried Peter sternly.

Quickly they made-believe to grow the loveliest roses up the
walls.

To prevent Peter ordering babies they hurried into song
again:


"We've made the roses peeping out,
The babes are at the door,
We cannot make ourselves, you know,
'cos we've been made before."


Peter, seeing this to be a good idea, at once pretended that it
was his own. The house was quite beautiful, and no doubt Wendy was
very cosy within, though, of course, they could no longer see her.
Peter strode up and down, ordering finishing touches. Nothing
escaped his eagle eyes. Just when it seemed absolutely
finished:

"There's no knocker on the door," he said.
