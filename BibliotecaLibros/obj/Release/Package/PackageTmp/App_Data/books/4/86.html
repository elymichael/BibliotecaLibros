"Captain," said Smee, "could we not kidnap these boys' mother<br/>and make her our mother?"<br/><br/>"It is a princely scheme," cried Hook, and at once it took<br/>practical shape in his great brain. "We will seize the children and<br/>carry them to the boat: the boys we will make walk the plank, and<br/>Wendy shall be our mother."<br/><br/>Again Wendy forgot herself.<br/><br/>"Never!" she cried, and bobbed.<br/><br/>"What was that?"<br/><br/>But they could see nothing. They thought it must have been a<br/>leaf in the wind. "Do you agree, my bullies?" asked Hook.<br/><br/>"There is my hand on it," they both said.<br/><br/>"And there is my hook. Swear."<br/><br/>They all swore. By this time they were on the rock, and suddenly<br/>Hook remembered Tiger Lily.<br/><br/>"Where is the redskin?" he demanded abruptly.<br/><br/>He had a playful humour at moments, and they thought this was<br/>one of the moments.<br/>
