They all gathered round him in affright, so alarming was his<br/>agitation; and with a fine candour he told them what he had<br/>hitherto concealed.<br/><br/>"Long ago," he said, "I thought like you that my mother would<br/>always keep the window open for me, so I stayed away for moons and<br/>moons and moons, and then flew back; but the window was barred, for<br/>mother had forgotten all about me, and there was another little boy<br/>sleeping in my bed."<br/><br/>I am not sure that this was true, but Peter thought it was true;<br/>and it scared them.<br/><br/>"Are you sure mothers are like that?"<br/><br/>"Yes."<br/><br/>So this was the truth about mothers. The toads!<br/><br/>Still it is best to be careful; and no one knows so quickly as a<br/>child when he should give in. "Wendy, let us [let's] go home,"<br/>cried John and Michael together.<br/><br/>"Yes," she said, clutching them.<br/><br/>"Not to-night?" asked the lost boys bewildered. They knew in<br/>what they called their hearts that one can get on quite well<br/>without a mother, and that it is only the mothers who think you<br/>can't.<br/><br/>"At once," Wendy replied resolutely, for the horrible thought<br/>had come to her: "Perhaps mother is in half mourning by this<br/>time."<br/><br/>This dread made her forgetful of what must be Peter's feelings,<br/>and she said to him rather sharply, "Peter, will you make the<br/>necessary arrangements?"<br/>
