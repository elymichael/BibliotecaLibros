It was quite as if she<br/>were trying to remain on the nursery floor.<br/><br/>But he had no pity for her.<br/><br/>"Wendy," he said, the sly one, "you could tuck us in at<br/>night."<br/><br/>"Oo!"<br/><br/>"None of us has ever been tucked in at night."<br/><br/>"Oo," and her arms went out to him.<br/><br/>"And you could darn our clothes, and make pockets for us. None<br/>of us has any pockets."<br/><br/>How could she resist. "Of course it's awfully fascinating!" she<br/>cried. "Peter, would you teach John and Michael to fly too?"<br/><br/>"If you like," he said indifferently, and she ran to John and<br/>Michael and shook them. "Wake up," she cried, "Peter Pan has come<br/>and he is to teach us to fly."<br/><br/>
