Five drops of this he now added to Peter's cup. His hand shook,<br/>but it was in exultation rather than in shame. As he did it he<br/>avoided glancing at the sleeper, but not lest pity should unnerve<br/>him; merely to avoid spilling. Then one long gloating look he cast<br/>upon his victim, and turning, wormed his way with difficulty up the<br/>tree. As he emerged at the top he looked the very spirit of evil<br/>breaking from its hole. Donning his hat at its most rakish angle,<br/>he wound his cloak around him, holding one end in front as if to<br/>conceal his person from the night, of which it was the blackest<br/>part, and muttering strangely to himself, stole away through the<br/>trees.<br/><br/>Peter slept on. The light guttered [burned to edges] and went<br/>out, leaving the tenement in darkness; but still he slept. It must<br/>have been not less than ten o'clock by the crocodile, when he<br/>suddenly sat up in his bed, wakened by he knew not what. It was a<br/>soft cautious tapping on the door of his tree.<br/><br/>Soft and cautious, but in that stillness it was sinister. Peter<br/>felt for his dagger till his hand gripped it. Then he spoke.<br/><br/>"Who is that?"<br/><br/>For long there was no answer: then again the knock.<br/><br/>"Who are you?"<br/><br/>No answer.<br/><br/>He was thrilled, and he loved being thrilled. In two strides he<br/>reached the door. Unlike Slightly's door, it filled the aperture<br/>[opening], so that he could not see beyond it, nor could the one<br/>knocking see him.<br/><br/>"I won't open unless you speak," Peter cried.<br/><br/>Then at last the visitor spoke, in a lovely bell-like voice.<br/><br/>"Let me in, Peter."<br/>
