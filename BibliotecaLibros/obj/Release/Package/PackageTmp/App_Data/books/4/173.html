<br/>And then one night came the tragedy. It was the spring of the<br/>year, and the story had been told for the night, and Jane was now<br/>asleep in her bed. Wendy was sitting on the floor, very close to<br/>the fire, so as to see to darn, for there was no other light in the<br/>nursery; and while she sat darning she heard a crow. Then the<br/>window blew open as of old, and Peter dropped in on the floor.<br/><br/>He was exactly the same as ever, and Wendy saw at once that he<br/>still had all his first teeth.<br/><br/>He was a little boy, and she was grown up. She huddled by the<br/>fire not daring to move, helpless and guilty, a big woman.<br/><br/>"Hullo, Wendy," he said, not noticing any difference, for he was<br/>thinking chiefly of himself; and in the dim light her white dress<br/>might have been the nightgown in which he had seen her first.<br/><br/>"Hullo, Peter," she replied faintly, squeezing herself as small<br/>as possible. Something inside her was crying "Woman, Woman, let go<br/>of me."<br/><br/>"Hullo, where is John?" he asked, suddenly missing the third<br/>bed.<br/><br/>"John is not here now," she gasped.<br/><br/>"Is Michael asleep?" he asked, with a careless glance at<br/>Jane.<br/><br/>"Yes," she answered; and now she felt that she was untrue to<br/>Jane as well as to Peter.<br/><br/>"That is not Michael," she said quickly, lest a judgment should<br/>fall on her.<br/><br/>
