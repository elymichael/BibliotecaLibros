<br/><br/>About Barrie:<br/><br/>Sir James Matthew Barrie, 1st Baronet OM (9 May 1860 â€“ 19 June<br/>1937), more commonly known as J. M. Barrie, was a Scottish novelist<br/>and dramatist. He is best remembered for creating Peter Pan, the<br/>boy who refused to grow up, whom he based on his friends, the<br/>Llewelyn Davies boys. He is also credited with popularising the<br/>name "Wendy", which was very uncommon before he gave it to the<br/>heroine of Peter Pan. He was made a baronet in 1913; his baronetcy<br/>was not inherited. He was made a member of the Order of Merit in<br/>1922.
