She went from bed to bed singing enchantments over them, and<br/>little Michael flung his arms round her. "Mother," he cried, "I'm<br/>glad of you." They were the last words she was to hear from him for<br/>a long time.<br/><br/>No. 27 was only a few yards distant, but there had been a slight<br/>fall of snow, and Father and Mother Darling picked their way over<br/>it deftly not to soil their shoes. They were already the only<br/>persons in the street, and all the stars were watching them. Stars<br/>are beautiful, but they may not take an active part in anything,<br/>they must just look on for ever. It is a punishment put on them for<br/>something they did so long ago that no star now knows what it was.<br/>So the older ones have become glassy-eyed and seldom speak (winking<br/>is the star language), but the little ones still wonder. They are<br/>not really friendly to Peter, who had a mischievous way of stealing<br/>up behind them and trying to blow them out; but they are so fond of<br/>fun that they were on his side to-night, and anxious to get the<br/>grown-ups out of the way. So as soon as the door of 27 closed on<br/>Mr. and Mrs. Darling there was a commotion in the firmament, and<br/>the smallest of all the stars in the Milky Way screamed out:<br/><br/>"Now, Peter!"<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
