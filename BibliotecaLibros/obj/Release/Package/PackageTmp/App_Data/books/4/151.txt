Now, now, he thought, true form will show.

But Peter issued from the powder magazine with the shell in his
hands, and calmly flung it overboard.

What sort of form was Hook himself showing? Misguided man though
he was, we may be glad, without sympathising with him, that in the
end he was true to the traditions of his race. The other boys were
flying around him now, flouting, scornful; and he staggered about
the deck striking up at them impotently, his mind was no longer
with them; it was slouching in the playing fields of long ago, or
being sent up [to the headmaster] for good, or watching the
wall-game from a famous wall. And his shoes were right, and his
waistcoat was right, and his tie was right, and his socks were
right.

James Hook, thou not wholly unheroic figure, farewell.

For we have come to his last moment.

Seeing Peter slowly advancing upon him through the air with
dagger poised, he sprang upon the bulwarks to cast himself into the
sea. He did not know that the crocodile was waiting for him; for we
purposely stopped the clock that this knowledge might be spared
him: a little mark of respect from us at the end.

He had one last triumph, which I think we need not grudge him.
As he stood on the bulwark looking over his shoulder at Peter
gliding through the air, he invited him with a gesture to use his
foot. It made Peter kick instead of stab.

At last Hook had got the boon for which he craved.

"Bad form," he cried jeeringly, and went content to the
crocodile.

Thus perished James Hook.

"Seventeen," Slightly sang out; but he was not quite correct in
his figures. Fifteen paid the penalty for their crimes that night;
but two reached the shore: Starkey to be captured by the redskins,
who made him nurse for all their papooses, a melancholy come-down
for a pirate; and Smee, who henceforth wandered about the world in
his spectacles, making a precarious living by saying he was the
only man that Jas. Hook had feared.
