"That is a long time ago, sweetheart," says Wendy. "Ah me, how
time flies!"

"Does it fly," asks the artful child, "the way you flew when you
were a little girl?"

"The way I flew? Do you know, Jane, I sometimes wonder whether I
ever did really fly."

"Yes, you did."

"The dear old days when I could fly!"

"Why can't you fly now, mother?"

"Because I am grown up, dearest. When people grow up they forget
the way."

"Why do they forget the way?"

"Because they are no longer gay and innocent and heartless. It
is only the gay and innocent and heartless who can fly."

"What is gay and innocent and heartless? I do wish I were gay
and innocent and heartless."

Or perhaps Wendy admits she does see something.
