"That is all right, captain," Smee answered complacently; "we
let her go."

"Let her go!" cried Hook.

"'Twas your own orders," the bo'sun faltered.

"You called over the water to us to let her go," said
Starkey.

"Brimstone and gall," thundered Hook, "what cozening [cheating]
is going on here!" His face had gone black with rage, but he saw
that they believed their words, and he was startled. "Lads," he
said, shaking a little, "I gave no such order."

"It is passing queer," Smee said, and they all fidgeted
uncomfortably. Hook raised his voice, but there was a quiver in
it.

"Spirit that haunts this dark lagoon to-night," he cried, "dost
hear me?"

Of course Peter should have kept quiet, but of course he did
not. He immediately answered in Hook's voice:

"Odds, bobs, hammer and tongs, I hear you."

In that supreme moment Hook did not blanch, even at the gills,
but Smee and Starkey clung to each other in terror.
