With a blow of their fists they made windows, and large yellow<br/>leaves were the blinds. But rosesâ€”?<br/><br/>"Roses," cried Peter sternly.<br/><br/>Quickly they made-believe to grow the loveliest roses up the<br/>walls.<br/><br/>Babies?<br/><br/>To prevent Peter ordering babies they hurried into song<br/>again:<br/><br/><br/>"We've made the roses peeping out,<br/>The babes are at the door,<br/>We cannot make ourselves, you know,<br/>'cos we've been made before."<br/><br/><br/>Peter, seeing this to be a good idea, at once pretended that it<br/>was his own. The house was quite beautiful, and no doubt Wendy was<br/>very cosy within, though, of course, they could no longer see her.<br/>Peter strode up and down, ordering finishing touches. Nothing<br/>escaped his eagle eyes. Just when it seemed absolutely<br/>finished:<br/><br/>"There's no knocker on the door," he said.<br/><br/>
