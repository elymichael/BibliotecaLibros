<br/>"Now!" cried all the boys, but with a magnificent gesture Peter<br/>invited his opponent to pick up his sword. Hook did so instantly,<br/>but with a tragic feeling that Peter was showing good form.<br/><br/>Hitherto he had thought it was some fiend fighting him, but<br/>darker suspicions assailed him now.<br/><br/>"Pan, who and what art thou?" he cried huskily.<br/><br/>"I'm youth, I'm joy," Peter answered at a venture, "I'm a little<br/>bird that has broken out of the egg."<br/><br/>This, of course, was nonsense; but it was proof to the unhappy<br/>Hook that Peter did not know in the least who or what he was, which<br/>is the very pinnacle of good form.<br/><br/>"To't again," he cried despairingly.<br/><br/>He fought now like a human flail, and every sweep of that<br/>terrible sword would have severed in twain any man or boy who<br/>obstructed it; but Peter fluttered round him as if the very wind it<br/>made blew him out of the danger zone. And again and again he darted<br/>in and pricked.<br/><br/>Hook was fighting now without hope. That passionate breast no<br/>longer asked for life; but for one boon it craved: to see Peter<br/>show bad form before it was cold forever.<br/><br/>Abandoning the fight he rushed into the powder magazine and<br/>fired it.<br/><br/>"In two minutes," he cried, "the ship will be blown to<br/>pieces."<br/><br/>
