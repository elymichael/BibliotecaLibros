"You see, Wendy, when the first baby laughed for the first time,<br/>its laugh broke into a thousand pieces, and they all went skipping<br/>about, and that was the beginning of fairies."<br/><br/>Tedious talk this, but being a stay-at-home she liked it.<br/><br/>"And so," he went on good-naturedly, "there ought to be one<br/>fairy for every boy and girl."<br/><br/>"Ought to be? Isn't there?"<br/><br/>"No. You see children know such a lot now, they soon don't<br/>believe in fairies, and every time a child says, 'I don't believe<br/>in fairies,' there is a fairy somewhere that falls down dead."<br/><br/>Really, he thought they had now talked enough about fairies, and<br/>it struck him that Tinker Bell was keeping very quiet. "I can't<br/>think where she has gone to," he said, rising, and he called Tink<br/>by name. Wendy's heart went flutter with a sudden thrill.<br/><br/>"Peter," she cried, clutching him, "you don't mean to tell me<br/>that there is a fairy in this room!"<br/><br/>"She was here just now," he said a little impatiently. "You<br/>don't hear her, do you?" and they both listened.<br/><br/>"The only sound I hear," said Wendy, "is like a tinkle of<br/>bells."<br/><br/>"Well, that's Tink, that's the fairy language. I think I hear<br/>her too."<br/><br/>The sound come from the chest of drawers, and Peter made a merry<br/>face. No one could ever look quite so merry as Peter, and the<br/>loveliest of gurgles was his laugh. He had his first laugh<br/>still.<br/>
