Peter looked. "Hullo, is it a new one?"<br/><br/>"Yes."<br/><br/>"Boy or girl?"<br/><br/>"Girl."<br/><br/>Now surely he would understand; but not a bit of it.<br/><br/>"Peter," she said, faltering, "are you expecting me to fly away<br/>with you?"<br/><br/>"Of course; that is why I have come." He added a little sternly,<br/>"Have you forgotten that this is spring cleaning time?"<br/><br/>She knew it was useless to say that he had let many spring<br/>cleaning times pass.<br/><br/>"I can't come," she said apologetically, "I have forgotten how<br/>to fly."<br/><br/>"I'll soon teach you again."<br/><br/>"O Peter, don't waste the fairy dust on me."<br/>
