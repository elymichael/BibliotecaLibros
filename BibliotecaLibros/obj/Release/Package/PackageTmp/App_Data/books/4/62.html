<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>6<br/>THE LITTLE HOUSE<br/><br/><br/>Foolish Tootles was standing like a conqueror over Wendy's body<br/>when the other boys sprang, armed, from their trees.<br/><br/>"You are too late," he cried proudly, "I have shot the Wendy.<br/>Peter will be so pleased with me."<br/><br/>Overhead Tinker Bell shouted "Silly ass!" and darted into<br/>hiding. The others did not hear her. They had crowded round Wendy,<br/>and as they looked a terrible silence fell upon the wood. If<br/>Wendy's heart had been beating they would all have heard it.<br/><br/>Slightly was the first to speak. "This is no bird," he said in a<br/>scared voice. "I think this must be a lady."<br/><br/>"A lady?" said Tootles, and fell a-trembling.<br/><br/>"And we have killed her," Nibs said hoarsely.<br/><br/>They all whipped off their caps.<br/>
