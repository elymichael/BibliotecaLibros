But it would not blow over and soon the troublesome boy gave
Mrs. Darling quite a shock.

Children have the strangest adventures without being troubled by
them. For instance, they may remember to mention, a week after the
event happened, that when they were in the wood they had met their
dead father and had a game with him. It was in this casual way that
Wendy one morning made a disquieting revelation. Some leaves of a
tree had been found on the nursery floor, which certainly were not
there when the children went to bed, and Mrs. Darling was puzzling
over them when Wendy said with a tolerant smile:

"I do believe it is that Peter again!"

"Whatever do you mean, Wendy?"

"It is so naughty of him not to wipe his feet," Wendy said,
sighing. She was a tidy child.

She explained in quite a matter-of-fact way that she thought
Peter sometimes came to the nursery in the night and sat on the
foot of her bed and played on his pipes to her. Unfortunately she
never woke, so she didn't know how she knew, she just knew.

"What nonsense you talk, precious. No one can get into the house
without knocking."

"I think he comes in by the window," she said.

"My love, it is three floors up."

"Were not the leaves at the foot of the window, mother?"
