"What do you mean by 'O father'?" Mr. Darling demanded. "Stop
that row, Michael. I meant to take mine, but I—I missed it."

It was dreadful the way all the three were looking at him, just
as if they did not admire him. "Look here, all of you," he said
entreatingly, as soon as Nana had gone into the bathroom. "I have
just thought of a splendid joke. I shall pour my medicine into
Nana's bowl, and she will drink it, thinking it is milk!"

It was the colour of milk; but the children did not have their
father's sense of humour, and they looked at him reproachfully as
he poured the medicine into Nana's bowl. "What fun!" he said
doubtfully, and they did not dare expose him when Mrs. Darling and
Nana returned.

"Nana, good dog," he said, patting her, "I have put a little
milk into your bowl, Nana."

Nana wagged her tail, ran to the medicine, and began lapping it.
Then she gave Mr. Darling such a look, not an angry look: she
showed him the great red tear that makes us so sorry for noble
dogs, and crept into her kennel.

Mr. Darling was frightfully ashamed of himself, but he would not
give in. In a horrid silence Mrs. Darling smelt the bowl. "O
George," she said, "it's your medicine!"

"It was only a joke," he roared, while she comforted her boys,
and Wendy hugged Nana. "Much good," he said bitterly, "my wearing
myself to the bone trying to be funny in this house."

And still Wendy hugged Nana. "That's right," he shouted. "Coddle
her! Nobody coddles me. Oh dear no! I am only the breadwinner, why
should I be coddled—why, why, why!"

"George," Mrs. Darling entreated him, "not so loud; the servants
will hear you." Somehow they had got into the way of calling Liza
the servants.

"Let them!" he answered recklessly. "Bring in the whole world.
But I refuse to allow that dog to lord it in my nursery for an hour
longer."

The children wept, and Nana ran to him beseechingly, but he
waved her back. He felt he was a strong man again. "In vain, in
vain," he cried; "the proper place for you is the yard, and there
you go to be tied up this instant."
