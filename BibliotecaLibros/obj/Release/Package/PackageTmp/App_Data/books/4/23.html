<br/>"Don't have a mother," he said. Not only had he no mother, but<br/>he had not the slightest desire to have one. He thought them very<br/>over-rated persons. Wendy, however, felt at once that she was in<br/>the presence of a tragedy.<br/><br/>"O Peter, no wonder you were crying," she said, and got out of<br/>bed and ran to him.<br/><br/>"I wasn't crying about mothers," he said rather indignantly. "I<br/>was crying because I can't get my shadow to stick on. Besides, I<br/>wasn't crying."<br/><br/>"It has come off?"<br/><br/>"Yes."<br/><br/>Then Wendy saw the shadow on the floor, looking so draggled, and<br/>she was frightfully sorry for Peter. "How awful!" she said, but she<br/>could not help smiling when she saw that he had been trying to<br/>stick it on with soap. How exactly like a boy!<br/><br/>Fortunately she knew at once what to do. "It must be sewn on,"<br/>she said, just a little patronisingly.<br/><br/>"What's sewn?" he asked.<br/><br/>"You're dreadfully ignorant."<br/><br/>"No, I'm not."<br/><br/>
