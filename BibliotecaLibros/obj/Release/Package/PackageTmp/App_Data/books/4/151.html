Now, now, he thought, true form will show.<br/><br/>But Peter issued from the powder magazine with the shell in his<br/>hands, and calmly flung it overboard.<br/><br/>What sort of form was Hook himself showing? Misguided man though<br/>he was, we may be glad, without sympathising with him, that in the<br/>end he was true to the traditions of his race. The other boys were<br/>flying around him now, flouting, scornful; and he staggered about<br/>the deck striking up at them impotently, his mind was no longer<br/>with them; it was slouching in the playing fields of long ago, or<br/>being sent up [to the headmaster] for good, or watching the<br/>wall-game from a famous wall. And his shoes were right, and his<br/>waistcoat was right, and his tie was right, and his socks were<br/>right.<br/><br/>James Hook, thou not wholly unheroic figure, farewell.<br/><br/>For we have come to his last moment.<br/><br/>Seeing Peter slowly advancing upon him through the air with<br/>dagger poised, he sprang upon the bulwarks to cast himself into the<br/>sea. He did not know that the crocodile was waiting for him; for we<br/>purposely stopped the clock that this knowledge might be spared<br/>him: a little mark of respect from us at the end.<br/><br/>He had one last triumph, which I think we need not grudge him.<br/>As he stood on the bulwark looking over his shoulder at Peter<br/>gliding through the air, he invited him with a gesture to use his<br/>foot. It made Peter kick instead of stab.<br/><br/>At last Hook had got the boon for which he craved.<br/><br/>"Bad form," he cried jeeringly, and went content to the<br/>crocodile.<br/><br/>Thus perished James Hook.<br/><br/>"Seventeen," Slightly sang out; but he was not quite correct in<br/>his figures. Fifteen paid the penalty for their crimes that night;<br/>but two reached the shore: Starkey to be captured by the redskins,<br/>who made him nurse for all their papooses, a melancholy come-down<br/>for a pirate; and Smee, who henceforth wandered about the world in<br/>his spectacles, making a precarious living by saying he was the<br/>only man that Jas. Hook had feared.<br/>
