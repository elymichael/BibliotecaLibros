"She says she glories in being abandoned," Peter
interpreted.

He had a sudden idea. "Perhaps Tink wants to be my mother?"

"You silly ass!" cried Tinker Bell in a passion.

She had said it so often that Wendy needed no translation.

"I almost agree with her," Wendy snapped. Fancy Wendy snapping!
But she had been much tried, and she little knew what was to happen
before the night was out. If she had known she would not have
snapped.

None of them knew. Perhaps it was best not to know. Their
ignorance gave them one more glad hour; and as it was to be their
last hour on the island, let us rejoice that there were sixty glad
minutes in it. They sang and danced in their night-gowns. Such a
deliciously creepy song it was, in which they pretended to be
frightened at their own shadows, little witting that so soon
shadows would close in upon them, from whom they would shrink in
real fear. So uproariously gay was the dance, and how they buffeted
each other on the bed and out of it! It was a pillow fight rather
than a dance, and when it was finished, the pillows insisted on one
bout more, like partners who know that they may never meet again.
The stories they told, before it was time for Wendy's good-night
story! Even Slightly tried to tell a story that night, but the
beginning was so fearfully dull that it appalled not only the
others but himself, and he said happily:

"Yes, it is a dull beginning. I say, let us pretend that it is
the end."

And then at last they all got into bed for Wendy's story, the
story they loved best, the story Peter hated. Usually when she
began to tell this story he left the room or put his hands over his
ears; and possibly if he had done either of those things this time
they might all still be on the island. But to-night he remained on
his stool; and we shall see what happened.
