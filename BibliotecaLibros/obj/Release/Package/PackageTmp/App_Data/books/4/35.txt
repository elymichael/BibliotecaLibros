It looked delightfully easy, and they tried it first from the

"I say, how do you do it?" asked John, rubbing his knee. He was

"and they lift you up in the air."

He showed them again.

slowly once?"

Peter did it both slowly and quickly. "I've got it now, Wendy!"
cried John, but soon he found he had not. Not one of them could fly
an inch, though even Michael was in words of two syllables, and
Peter did not know A from Z.
