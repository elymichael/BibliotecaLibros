<br/>"But why, Tink?"<br/><br/>Her wings would scarcely carry her now, but in reply she<br/>alighted on his shoulder and gave his nose a loving bite. She<br/>whispered in his ear "You silly ass," and then, tottering to her<br/>chamber, lay down on the bed.<br/><br/>His head almost filled the fourth wall of her little room as he<br/>knelt near her in distress. Every moment her light was growing<br/>fainter; and he knew that if it went out she would be no more. She<br/>liked his tears so much that she put out her beautiful finger and<br/>let them run over it.<br/><br/>Her voice was so low that at first he could not make out what<br/>she said. Then he made it out. She was saying that she thought she<br/>could get well again if children believed in fairies.<br/><br/>Peter flung out his arms. There were no children there, and it<br/>was night time; but he addressed all who might be dreaming of the<br/>Neverland, and who were therefore nearer to him than you think:<br/>boys and girls in their nighties, and naked papooses in their<br/>baskets hung from trees.<br/><br/>"Do you believe?" he cried.<br/><br/>Tink sat up in bed almost briskly to listen to her fate.<br/><br/>She fancied she heard answers in the affirmative, and then again<br/>she wasn't sure.<br/><br/>"What do you think?" she asked Peter.<br/><br/>"If you believe," he shouted to them, "clap your hands; don't<br/>let Tink die."<br/><br/>
