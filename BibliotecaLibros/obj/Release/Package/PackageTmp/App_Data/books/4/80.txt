THE MERMAIDS' LAGOON


If you shut your eyes and are a lucky one, you may see at times
a shapeless pool of lovely pale colours suspended in the darkness;
then if you squeeze your eyes tighter, the pool begins to take
shape, and the colours become so vivid that with another squeeze
they must go on fire. But just before they go on fire you see the
lagoon. This is the nearest you ever get to it on the mainland,
just one heavenly moment; if there could be two moments you might
see the surf and hear the mermaids singing.

The children often spent long summer days on this lagoon,
swimming or floating most of the time, playing the mermaid games in
the water, and so forth. You must not think from this that the
mermaids were on friendly terms with them: on the contrary, it was
among Wendy's lasting regrets that all the time she was on the
island she never had a civil word from one of them. When she stole
softly to the edge of the lagoon she might see them by the score,
especially on Marooners' Rock, where they loved to bask, combing
out their hair in a lazy way that quite irritated her; or she might
even swim, on tiptoe as it were, to within a yard of them, but then
they saw her and dived, probably splashing her with their tails,
not by accident, but intentionally.

They treated all the boys in the same way, except of course
Peter, who chatted with them on Marooners' Rock by the hour, and
sat on their tails when they got cheeky. He gave Wendy one of their
combs.

The most haunting time at which to see them is at the turn of
the moon, when they utter strange wailing cries; but the lagoon is
dangerous for mortals then, and until the evening of which we have
now to tell, Wendy had never seen the lagoon by moonlight, less
from fear, for of course Peter would have accompanied her, than
because she had strict rules about every one being in bed by seven.
She was often at the lagoon, however, on sunny days after rain,
when the mermaids come up in extraordinary numbers to play with
their bubbles. The bubbles of many colours made in rainbow water
they treat as balls, hitting them gaily from one to another with
their tails, and trying to keep them in the rainbow till they
burst. The goals are at each end of the rainbow, and the keepers
only are allowed to use their hands. Sometimes a dozen of these
games will be going on in the lagoon at a time, and it is quite a
pretty sight.

But the moment the children tried to join in they had to play by
themselves, for the mermaids immediately disappeared. Nevertheless
we have proof that they secretly watched the interlopers, and were
not above taking an idea from them; for John introduced a new way
of hitting the bubble, with the head instead of the hand, and the
mermaids adopted it. This is the one mark that John has left on the
Neverland.

It must also have been rather pretty to see the children resting
on a rock for half an hour after their mid-day meal. Wendy insisted
on their doing this, and it had to be a real rest even though the
meal was make-believe. So they lay there in the sun, and their
bodies glistened in it, while she sat beside them and looked
important.

It was one such day, and they were all on Marooners' Rock. The
rock was not much larger than their great bed, but of course they
all knew how not to take up much room, and they were dozing, or at
least lying with their eyes shut, and pinching occasionally when
they thought Wendy was not looking. She was very busy,
stitching.
