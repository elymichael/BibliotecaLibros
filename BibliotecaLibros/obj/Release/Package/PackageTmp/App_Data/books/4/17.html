"What do you mean by 'O father'?" Mr. Darling demanded. "Stop<br/>that row, Michael. I meant to take mine, but I—I missed it."<br/><br/>It was dreadful the way all the three were looking at him, just<br/>as if they did not admire him. "Look here, all of you," he said<br/>entreatingly, as soon as Nana had gone into the bathroom. "I have<br/>just thought of a splendid joke. I shall pour my medicine into<br/>Nana's bowl, and she will drink it, thinking it is milk!"<br/><br/>It was the colour of milk; but the children did not have their<br/>father's sense of humour, and they looked at him reproachfully as<br/>he poured the medicine into Nana's bowl. "What fun!" he said<br/>doubtfully, and they did not dare expose him when Mrs. Darling and<br/>Nana returned.<br/><br/>"Nana, good dog," he said, patting her, "I have put a little<br/>milk into your bowl, Nana."<br/><br/>Nana wagged her tail, ran to the medicine, and began lapping it.<br/>Then she gave Mr. Darling such a look, not an angry look: she<br/>showed him the great red tear that makes us so sorry for noble<br/>dogs, and crept into her kennel.<br/><br/>Mr. Darling was frightfully ashamed of himself, but he would not<br/>give in. In a horrid silence Mrs. Darling smelt the bowl. "O<br/>George," she said, "it's your medicine!"<br/><br/>"It was only a joke," he roared, while she comforted her boys,<br/>and Wendy hugged Nana. "Much good," he said bitterly, "my wearing<br/>myself to the bone trying to be funny in this house."<br/><br/>And still Wendy hugged Nana. "That's right," he shouted. "Coddle<br/>her! Nobody coddles me. Oh dear no! I am only the breadwinner, why<br/>should I be coddled—why, why, why!"<br/><br/>"George," Mrs. Darling entreated him, "not so loud; the servants<br/>will hear you." Somehow they had got into the way of calling Liza<br/>the servants.<br/><br/>"Let them!" he answered recklessly. "Bring in the whole world.<br/>But I refuse to allow that dog to lord it in my nursery for an hour<br/>longer."<br/><br/>The children wept, and Nana ran to him beseechingly, but he<br/>waved her back. He felt he was a strong man again. "In vain, in<br/>vain," he cried; "the proper place for you is the yard, and there<br/>you go to be tied up this instant."<br/>
