Wonderful to relate [tell], Wendy had raised her arm. Nibs bent<br/>over her and listened reverently. "I think she said, 'Poor<br/>Tootles,'" he whispered.<br/><br/>"She lives," Peter said briefly.<br/><br/>Slightly cried instantly, "The Wendy lady lives."<br/><br/>Then Peter knelt beside her and found his button. You remember<br/>she had put it on a chain that she wore round her neck.<br/><br/>"See," he said, "the arrow struck against this. It is the kiss I<br/>gave her. It has saved her life."<br/><br/>"I remember kisses," Slightly interposed quickly, "let me see<br/>it. Ay, that's a kiss."<br/><br/>Peter did not hear him. He was begging Wendy to get better<br/>quickly, so that he could show her the mermaids. Of course she<br/>could not answer yet, being still in a frightful faint; but from<br/>overhead came a wailing note.<br/><br/>"Listen to Tink," said Curly, "she is crying because the Wendy<br/>lives."<br/><br/>Then they had to tell Peter of Tink's crime, and almost never<br/>had they seen him look so stern.<br/><br/>"Listen, Tinker Bell," he cried, "I am your friend no more.<br/>Begone from me for ever."<br/><br/>She flew on to his shoulder and pleaded, but he brushed her off.<br/>Not until Wendy again raised her arm did he relent sufficiently to<br/>say, "Well, not for ever, but for a whole week."<br/>
