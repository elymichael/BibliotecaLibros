Or we could tell of that cake the pirates cooked so that the
boys might eat it and perish; and how they placed it in one cunning
spot after another; but always Wendy snatched it from the hands of
her children, so that in time it lost its succulence, and became as
hard as a stone, and was used as a missile, and Hook fell over it
in the dark.

Or suppose we tell of the birds that were Peter's friends,
particularly of the Never bird that built in a tree overhanging the
lagoon, and how the nest fell into the water, and still the bird
sat on her eggs, and Peter gave orders that she was not to be
disturbed. That is a pretty story, and the end shows how grateful a
bird can be; but if we tell it we must also tell the whole
adventure of the lagoon, which would of course be telling two
adventures rather than just one. A shorter adventure, and quite as
exciting, was Tinker Bell's attempt, with the help of some street
fairies, to have the sleeping Wendy conveyed on a great floating
leaf to the mainland. Fortunately the leaf gave way and Wendy woke,
thinking it was bath-time, and swam back. Or again, we might choose
Peter's defiance of the lions, when he drew a circle round him on
the ground with an arrow and dared them to cross it; and though he
waited for hours, with the other boys and Wendy looking on
breathlessly from trees, not one of them dared to accept his
challenge.

Which of these adventures shall we choose? The best way will be
to toss for it.

I have tossed, and the lagoon has won. This almost makes one
wish that the gulch or the cake or Tink's leaf had won. Of course I
could do it again, and make it best out of three; however, perhaps
fairest to stick to the lagoon.
