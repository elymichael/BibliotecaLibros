<br/>"Not of crocodiles," Hook corrected him, "but of that one<br/>crocodile." He lowered his voice. "It liked my arm so much, Smee,<br/>that it has followed me ever since, from sea to sea and from land<br/>to land, licking its lips for the rest of me."<br/><br/>"In a way," said Smee, "it's sort of a compliment."<br/><br/>"I want no such compliments," Hook barked petulantly. "I want<br/>Peter Pan, who first gave the brute its taste for me."<br/><br/>He sat down on a large mushroom, and now there was a quiver in<br/>his voice. "Smee," he said huskily, "that crocodile would have had<br/>me before this, but by a lucky chance it swallowed a clock which<br/>goes tick tick inside it, and so before it can reach me I hear the<br/>tick and bolt." He laughed, but in a hollow way.<br/><br/>"Some day," said Smee, "the clock will run down, and then he'll<br/>get you."<br/><br/>Hook wetted his dry lips. "Ay," he said, "that's the fear that<br/>haunts me."<br/><br/>Since sitting down he had felt curiously warm. "Smee," he said,<br/>"this seat is hot." He jumped up. "Odds bobs, hammer and tongs I'm<br/>burning."<br/><br/>They examined the mushroom, which was of a size and solidity<br/>unknown on the mainland; they tried to pull it up, and it came away<br/>at once in their hands, for it had no root. Stranger still, smoke<br/>began at once to ascend. The pirates looked at each other. "A<br/>chimney!" they both exclaimed.<br/><br/>They had indeed discovered the chimney of the home under the<br/>ground. It was the custom of the boys to stop it with a mushroom<br/>when enemies were in the neighbourhood.<br/><br/>Not only smoke came out of it. There came also children's<br/>voices, for so safe did the boys feel in their hiding-place that<br/>they were gaily chattering. The pirates listened grimly, and then<br/>replaced the mushroom. They looked around them and noted the holes<br/>in the seven trees.<br/><br/>
