"I'm Wendy," she said agitatedly.

He was very sorry. "I say, Wendy," he whispered to her, "always
if you see me forgetting you, just keep on saying 'I'm Wendy,' and
then I'll remember."

Of course this was rather unsatisfactory. However, to make
amends he showed them how to lie out flat on a strong wind that was
going their way, and this was such a pleasant change that they
tried it several times and found that they could sleep thus with
security. Indeed they would have slept longer, but Peter tired
quickly of sleeping, and soon he would cry in his captain voice,
"We get off here." So with occasional tiffs, but on the whole
rollicking, they drew near the Neverland; for after many moons they
did reach it, and, what is more, they had been going pretty
straight all the time, not perhaps so much owing to the guidance of
Peter or Tink as because the island was looking for them. It is
only thus that any one may sight those magic shores.

"There it is," said Peter calmly.

"Where, where?"

"Where all the arrows are pointing."

Indeed a million golden arrows were pointing it out to the
children, all directed by their friend the sun, who wanted them to
be sure of their way before leaving them for the night.

Wendy and John and Michael stood on tip-toe in the air to get
their first sight of the island. Strange to say, they all
recognized it at once, and until fear fell upon them they hailed
it, not as something long dreamt of and seen at last, but as a
familiar friend to whom they were returning home for the
holidays.

"John, there's the lagoon."

"Wendy, look at the turtles burying their eggs in the sand."
