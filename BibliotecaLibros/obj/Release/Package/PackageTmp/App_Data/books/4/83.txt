betray himself, so at once her hand went out to cover his mouth.
But it was stayed even in the act, for "Boat ahoy!" rang over the
lagoon in Hook's voice, and this time it was not Peter who had
spoken.

Peter may have been about to crow, but his face puckered in a
whistle of surprise instead.

"Boat ahoy!" again came the voice.
