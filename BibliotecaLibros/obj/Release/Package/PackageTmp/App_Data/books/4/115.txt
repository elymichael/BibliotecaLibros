"And who are the two noble portly figures accompanying her, now
grown to man's estate? Can they be John and Michael? They are!"

"Oh!"

"'See, dear brothers,' says Wendy pointing upwards, 'there is
the window still standing open. Ah, now we are rewarded for our
sublime faith in a mother's love.' So up they flew to their mummy
and daddy, and pen cannot describe the happy scene, over which we
draw a veil."

That was the story, and they were as pleased with it as the fair
narrator herself. Everything just as it should be, you see. Off we
skip like the most heartless things in the world, which is what
children are, but so attractive; and we have an entirely selfish
time, and then when we have need of special attention we nobly
return for it, confident that we shall be rewarded instead of
smacked.

So great indeed was their faith in a mother's love that they
felt they could afford to be callous for a bit longer.

But there was one there who knew better, and when Wendy finished
he uttered a hollow groan.

"What is it, Peter?" she cried, running to him, thinking he was
ill. She felt him solicitously, lower down than his chest. "Where
is it, Peter?"

"It isn't that kind of pain," Peter replied darkly.

"Then what kind is it?"

"Wendy, you are wrong about mothers."
