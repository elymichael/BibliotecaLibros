<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>8<br/>THE MERMAIDS' LAGOON<br/><br/><br/>If you shut your eyes and are a lucky one, you may see at times<br/>a shapeless pool of lovely pale colours suspended in the darkness;<br/>then if you squeeze your eyes tighter, the pool begins to take<br/>shape, and the colours become so vivid that with another squeeze<br/>they must go on fire. But just before they go on fire you see the<br/>lagoon. This is the nearest you ever get to it on the mainland,<br/>just one heavenly moment; if there could be two moments you might<br/>see the surf and hear the mermaids singing.<br/><br/>The children often spent long summer days on this lagoon,<br/>swimming or floating most of the time, playing the mermaid games in<br/>the water, and so forth. You must not think from this that the<br/>mermaids were on friendly terms with them: on the contrary, it was<br/>among Wendy's lasting regrets that all the time she was on the<br/>island she never had a civil word from one of them. When she stole<br/>softly to the edge of the lagoon she might see them by the score,<br/>especially on Marooners' Rock, where they loved to bask, combing<br/>out their hair in a lazy way that quite irritated her; or she might<br/>even swim, on tiptoe as it were, to within a yard of them, but then<br/>they saw her and dived, probably splashing her with their tails,<br/>not by accident, but intentionally.<br/><br/>They treated all the boys in the same way, except of course<br/>Peter, who chatted with them on Marooners' Rock by the hour, and<br/>sat on their tails when they got cheeky. He gave Wendy one of their<br/>combs.<br/><br/>The most haunting time at which to see them is at the turn of<br/>the moon, when they utter strange wailing cries; but the lagoon is<br/>dangerous for mortals then, and until the evening of which we have<br/>now to tell, Wendy had never seen the lagoon by moonlight, less<br/>from fear, for of course Peter would have accompanied her, than<br/>because she had strict rules about every one being in bed by seven.<br/>She was often at the lagoon, however, on sunny days after rain,<br/>when the mermaids come up in extraordinary numbers to play with<br/>their bubbles. The bubbles of many colours made in rainbow water<br/>they treat as balls, hitting them gaily from one to another with<br/>their tails, and trying to keep them in the rainbow till they<br/>burst. The goals are at each end of the rainbow, and the keepers<br/>only are allowed to use their hands. Sometimes a dozen of these<br/>games will be going on in the lagoon at a time, and it is quite a<br/>pretty sight.<br/><br/>But the moment the children tried to join in they had to play by<br/>themselves, for the mermaids immediately disappeared. Nevertheless<br/>we have proof that they secretly watched the interlopers, and were<br/>not above taking an idea from them; for John introduced a new way<br/>of hitting the bubble, with the head instead of the hand, and the<br/>mermaids adopted it. This is the one mark that John has left on the<br/>Neverland.<br/><br/>It must also have been rather pretty to see the children resting<br/>on a rock for half an hour after their mid-day meal. Wendy insisted<br/>on their doing this, and it had to be a real rest even though the<br/>meal was make-believe. So they lay there in the sun, and their<br/>bodies glistened in it, while she sat beside them and looked<br/>important.<br/><br/>It was one such day, and they were all on Marooners' Rock. The<br/>rock was not much larger than their great bed, but of course they<br/>all knew how not to take up much room, and they were dozing, or at<br/>least lying with their eyes shut, and pinching occasionally when<br/>they thought Wendy was not looking. She was very busy,<br/>stitching.<br/>
