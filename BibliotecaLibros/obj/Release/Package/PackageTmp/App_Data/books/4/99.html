Nevertheless the bird was determined to save him if she could,<br/>and by one last mighty effort she propelled the nest against the<br/>rock. Then up she flew; deserting her eggs, so as to make her<br/>meaning clear.<br/><br/>Then at last he understood, and clutched the nest and waved his<br/>thanks to the bird as she fluttered overhead. It was not to receive<br/>his thanks, however, that she hung there in the sky; it was not<br/>even to watch him get into the nest; it was to see what he did with<br/>her eggs.<br/><br/>There were two large white eggs, and Peter lifted them up and<br/>reflected. The bird covered her face with her wings, so as not to<br/>see the last of them; but she could not help peeping between the<br/>feathers.<br/><br/>I forget whether I have told you that there was a stave on the<br/>rock, driven into it by some buccaneers of long ago to mark the<br/>site of buried treasure. The children had discovered the glittering<br/>hoard, and when in a mischievous mood used to fling showers of<br/>moidores, diamonds, pearls and pieces of eight to the gulls, who<br/>pounced upon them for food, and then flew away, raging at the<br/>scurvy trick that had been played upon them. The stave was still<br/>there, and on it Starkey had hung his hat, a deep tarpaulin,<br/>watertight, with a broad brim. Peter put the eggs into this hat and<br/>set it on the lagoon. It floated beautifully.<br/><br/>The Never bird saw at once what he was up to, and screamed her<br/>admiration of him; and, alas, Peter crowed his agreement with her.<br/>Then he got into the nest, reared the stave in it as a mast, and<br/>hung up his shirt for a sail. At the same moment the bird fluttered<br/>down upon the hat and once more sat snugly on her eggs. She drifted<br/>in one direction, and he was borne off in another, both<br/>cheering.<br/><br/>Of course when Peter landed he beached his barque [small ship,<br/>actually the Never Bird's nest in this particular case in point] in<br/>a place where the bird would easily find it; but the hat was such a<br/>great success that she abandoned the nest. It drifted about till it<br/>went to pieces, and often Starkey came to the shore of the lagoon,<br/>and with many bitter feelings watched the bird sitting on his hat.<br/>As we shall not see her again, it may be worth mentioning here that<br/>all Never birds now build in that shape of nest, with a broad brim<br/>on which the youngsters take an airing.<br/><br/>Great were the rejoicings when Peter reached the home under the<br/>ground almost as soon as Wendy, who had been carried hither and<br/>thither by the kite. Every boy had adventures to tell; but perhaps<br/>the biggest adventure of all was that they were several hours late<br/>for bed. This so inflated them that they did various dodgy things<br/>to get staying up still longer, such as demanding bandages; but<br/>Wendy, though glorying in having them all home again safe and<br/>sound, was scandalised by the lateness of the hour, and cried, "To<br/>bed, to bed," in a voice that had to be obeyed. Next day, however,<br/>she was awfully tender, and gave out bandages to every one, and<br/>they played till bed-time at limping about and carrying their arms<br/>in slings.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
