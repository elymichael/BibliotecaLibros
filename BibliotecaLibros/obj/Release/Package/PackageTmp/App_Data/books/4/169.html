<br/>That was the last time the girl Wendy ever saw him. For a little<br/>longer she tried for his sake not to have growing pains; and she<br/>felt she was untrue to him when she got a prize for general<br/>knowledge. But the years came and went without bringing the<br/>careless boy; and when they met again Wendy was a married woman,<br/>and Peter was no more to her than a little dust in the box in which<br/>she had kept her toys. Wendy was grown up. You need not be sorry<br/>for her. She was one of the kind that likes to grow up. In the end<br/>she grew up of her own free will a day quicker than other<br/>girls.<br/><br/>All the boys were grown up and done for by this time; so it is<br/>scarcely worth while saying anything more about them. You may see<br/>the twins and Nibs and Curly any day going to an office, each<br/>carrying a little bag and an umbrella. Michael is an engine-driver<br/>[train engineer]. Slightly married a lady of title, and so he<br/>became a lord. You see that judge in a wig coming out at the iron<br/>door? That used to be Tootles. The bearded man who doesn't know any<br/>story to tell his children was once John.<br/><br/>Wendy was married in white with a pink sash. It is strange to<br/>think that Peter did not alight in the church and forbid the banns<br/>[formal announcement of a marriage].<br/><br/>Years rolled on again, and Wendy had a daughter. This ought not<br/>to be written in ink but in a golden splash.<br/><br/>She was called Jane, and always had an odd inquiring look, as if<br/>from the moment she arrived on the mainland she wanted to ask<br/>questions. When she was old enough to ask them they were mostly<br/>about Peter Pan. She loved to hear of Peter, and Wendy told her all<br/>she could remember in the very nursery from which the famous flight<br/>had taken place. It was Jane's nursery now, for her father had<br/>bought it at the three per cents [mortgage rate] from Wendy's<br/>father, who was no longer fond of stairs. Mrs. Darling was now dead<br/>and forgotten.<br/><br/>There were only two beds in the nursery now, Jane's and her<br/>nurse's; and there was no kennel, for Nana also had passed away.<br/>She died of old age, and at the end she had been rather difficult<br/>to get on with; being very firmly convinced that no one knew how to<br/>look after children except herself.<br/><br/>Once a week Jane's nurse had her evening off; and then it was<br/>Wendy's part to put Jane to bed. That was the time for stories. It<br/>was Jane's invention to raise the sheet over her mother's head and<br/>her own, this making a tent, and in the awful darkness to<br/>whisper:<br/><br/>"What do we see now?"<br/><br/>"I don't think I see anything to-night," says Wendy, with a<br/>feeling that if Nana were here she would object to further<br/>conversation.<br/><br/>"Yes, you do," says Jane, "you see when you were a little<br/>girl."<br/><br/>
