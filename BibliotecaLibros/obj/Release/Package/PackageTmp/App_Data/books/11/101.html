<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>13<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>He passed out of the room and began the ascent, Basil Hallward<br/>following close behind. They walked softly, as men do instinctively<br/>at night. The lamp cast fantastic shadows on the wall and<br/>staircase. A rising wind made some of the windows rattle.<br/><br/>When they reached the top landing, Dorian set the lamp down on<br/>the floor, and taking out the key, turned it in the lock. "You<br/>insist on knowing, Basil?" he asked in a low voice.<br/><br/>"Yes."<br/><br/>"I am delighted," he answered, smiling. Then he added, somewhat<br/>harshly, "You are the one man in the world who is entitled to know<br/>everything about me. You have had more to do with my life than you<br/>think"; and, taking up the lamp, he opened the door and went in. A<br/>cold current of air passed them, and the light shot up for a moment<br/>in a flame of murky orange. He shuddered. "Shut the door behind<br/>you," he whispered, as he placed the lamp on the table.<br/><br/>Hallward glanced round him with a puzzled expression. The room<br/>looked as if it had not been lived in for years. A faded Flemish<br/>tapestry, a curtained picture, an old Italian cassone, and an<br/>almost empty book-caseâ€”that was all that it seemed to contain,<br/>besides a chair and a table. As Dorian Gray was lighting a<br/>half-burned candle that was standing on the mantelshelf, he saw<br/>that the whole place was covered with dust and that the carpet was<br/>in holes. A mouse ran scuffling behind the wainscoting. There was a<br/>damp odour of mildew.<br/><br/>"So you think that it is only God who sees the soul, Basil? Draw<br/>that curtain back, and you will see mine."<br/><br/>
