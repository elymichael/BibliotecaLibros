A new life! That was what he wanted. That was what he was
waiting for. Surely he had begun it already. He had spared one
innocent thing, at any rate. He would never again tempt innocence.
He would be good.

As he thought of Hetty Merton, he began to wonder if the
portrait in the locked room had changed. Surely it was not still so
horrible as it had been? Perhaps if his life became pure, he would
be able to expel every sign of evil passion from the face. Perhaps
the signs of evil had already gone away. He would go and look.

He took the lamp from the table and crept upstairs. As he
unbarred the door, a smile of joy flitted across his strangely
young-looking face and lingered for a moment about his lips. Yes,
he would be good, and the hideous thing that he had hidden away
would no longer be a terror to him. He felt as if the load had been
lifted from him already.

He went in quietly, locking the door behind him, as was his
custom, and dragged the purple hanging from the portrait. A cry of
pain and indignation broke from him. He could see no change, save
that in the eyes there was a look of cunning and in the mouth the
curved wrinkle of the hypocrite. The thing was still loathsome—more
loathsome, if possible, than before—and the scarlet dew that
spotted the hand seemed brighter, and more like blood newly
spilled. Then he trembled. Had it been merely vanity that had made
him do his one good deed? Or the desire for a new sensation, as
Lord Henry had hinted, with his mocking laugh? Or that passion to
act a part that sometimes makes us do things finer than we are
ourselves? Or, perhaps, all these? And why was the red stain larger
than it had been? It seemed to have crept like a horrible disease
over the wrinkled fingers. There was blood on the painted feet, as
though the thing had dripped—blood even on the hand that had not
held the knife. Confess? Did it mean that he was to confess? To
give himself up and be put to death? He laughed. He felt that the
idea was monstrous. Besides, even if he did confess, who would
believe him? There was no trace of the murdered man anywhere.
Everything belonging to him had been destroyed. He himself had
burned what had been below-stairs. The world would simply say that
he was mad. They would shut him up if he persisted in his story… .
Yet it was his duty to confess, to suffer public shame, and to make
public atonement. There was a God who called upon men to tell their
sins to earth as well as to heaven. Nothing that he could do would
cleanse him till he had told his own sin. His sin? He shrugged his
shoulders. The death of Basil Hallward seemed very little to him.
He was thinking of Hetty Merton. For it was an unjust mirror, this
mirror of his soul that he was looking at. Vanity? Curiosity?
Hypocrisy? Had there been nothing more in his renunciation than
that? There had been something more. At least he thought so. But
who could tell?&#160;… No. There had been nothing more. Through
vanity he had spared her. In hypocrisy he had worn the mask of
goodness. For curiosity's sake he had tried the denial of self. He
recognized that now.

But this murder—was it to dog him all his life? Was he always to
be burdened by his past? Was he really to confess? Never. There was
only one bit of evidence left against him. The picture itself— that
was evidence. He would destroy it. Why had he kept it so long? Once
it had given him pleasure to watch it changing and growing old. Of
late he had felt no such pleasure. It had kept him awake at night.
When he had been away, he had been filled with terror lest other
eyes should look upon it. It had brought melancholy across his
passions. Its mere memory had marred many moments of joy. It had
been like conscience to him. Yes, it had been conscience. He would
destroy it.

He looked round and saw the knife that had stabbed Basil
Hallward. He had cleaned it many times, till there was no stain
left upon it. It was bright, and glistened. As it had killed the
painter, so it would kill the painter's work, and all that that
meant. It would kill the past, and when that was dead, he would be
free. It would kill this monstrous soul-life, and without its
hideous warnings, he would be at peace. He seized the thing, and
stabbed the picture with it.

There was a cry heard, and a crash. The cry was so horrible in
its agony that the frightened servants woke and crept out of their
rooms. Two gentlemen, who were passing in the square below, stopped
and looked up at the great house. They walked on till they met a
policeman and brought him back. The man rang the bell several
times, but there was no answer. Except for a light in one of the
top windows, the house was all dark. After a time, he went away and
stood in an adjoining portico and watched.

"Whose house is that, Constable?" asked the elder of the two
gentlemen.

"Mr. Dorian Gray's, sir," answered the policeman.

They looked at each other, as they walked away, and sneered. One
of them was Sir Henry Ashton's uncle.

Inside, in the servants' part of the house, the half-clad
domestics were talking in low whispers to each other. Old Mrs. Leaf
was crying and wringing her hands. Francis was as pale as
death.
