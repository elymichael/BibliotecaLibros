"I had intended never to enter your house again, Gray. But you<br/>said it was a matter of life and death." His voice was hard and<br/>cold. He spoke with slow deliberation. There was a look of contempt<br/>in the steady searching gaze that he turned on Dorian. He kept his<br/>hands in the pockets of his Astrakhan coat, and seemed not to have<br/>noticed the gesture with which he had been greeted.<br/><br/>"Yes: it is a matter of life and death, Alan, and to more than<br/>one person. Sit down."<br/><br/>Campbell took a chair by the table, and Dorian sat opposite to<br/>him. The two men's eyes met. In Dorian's there was infinite pity.<br/>He knew that what he was going to do was dreadful.<br/><br/>After a strained moment of silence, he leaned across and said,<br/>very quietly, but watching the effect of each word upon the face of<br/>him he had sent for, "Alan, in a locked room at the top of this<br/>house, a room to which nobody but myself has access, a dead man is<br/>seated at a table. He has been dead ten hours now. Don't stir, and<br/>don't look at me like that. Who the man is, why he died, how he<br/>died, are matters that do not concern you. What you have to do is<br/>this—"<br/><br/>"Stop, Gray. I don't want to know anything further. Whether what<br/>you have told me is true or not true doesn't concern me. I entirely<br/>decline to be mixed up in your life. Keep your horrible secrets to<br/>yourself. They don't interest me any more."<br/><br/>"Alan, they will have to interest you. This one will have to<br/>interest you. I am awfully sorry for you, Alan. But I can't help<br/>myself. You are the one man who is able to save me. I am forced to<br/>bring you into the matter. I have no option. Alan, you are<br/>scientific. You know about chemistry and things of that kind. You<br/>have made experiments. What you have got to do is to destroy the<br/>thing that is upstairs— to destroy it so that not a vestige of it<br/>will be left. Nobody saw this person come into the house. Indeed,<br/>at the present moment he is supposed to be in Paris. He will not be<br/>missed for months. When he is missed, there must be no trace of him<br/>found here. You, Alan, you must change him, and everything that<br/>belongs to him, into a handful of ashes that I may scatter in the<br/>air."<br/><br/>"You are mad, Dorian."<br/><br/>"Ah! I was waiting for you to call me Dorian."<br/><br/>"You are mad, I tell you—mad to imagine that I would raise a<br/>finger to help you, mad to make this monstrous confession. I will<br/>have nothing to do with this matter, whatever it is. Do you think I<br/>am going to peril my reputation for you? What is it to me what<br/>devil's work you are up to?"<br/><br/>"It was suicide, Alan."<br/><br/>"I am glad of that. But who drove him to it? You, I should<br/>fancy."<br/>
