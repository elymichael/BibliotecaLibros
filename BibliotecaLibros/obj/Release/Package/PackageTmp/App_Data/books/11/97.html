"I shall be charmed. But won't you miss your train?" said Dorian<br/>Gray languidly as he passed up the steps and opened the door with<br/>his latch-key.<br/><br/>The lamplight struggled out through the fog, and Hallward looked<br/>at his watch. "I have heaps of time," he answered. "The train<br/>doesn't go till twelve-fifteen, and it is only just eleven. In<br/>fact, I was on my way to the club to look for you, when I met you.<br/>You see, I shan't have any delay about luggage, as I have sent on<br/>my heavy things. All I have with me is in this bag, and I can<br/>easily get to Victoria in twenty minutes."<br/><br/>Dorian looked at him and smiled. "What a way for a fashionable<br/>painter to travel! A Gladstone bag and an ulster! Come in, or the<br/>fog will get into the house. And mind you don't talk about anything<br/>serious. Nothing is serious nowadays. At least nothing should<br/>be."<br/><br/>Hallward shook his head, as he entered, and followed Dorian into<br/>the library. There was a bright wood fire blazing in the large open<br/>hearth. The lamps were lit, and an open Dutch silver spirit-case<br/>stood, with some siphons of soda-water and large cut-glass<br/>tumblers, on a little marqueterie table.<br/><br/>"You see your servant made me quite at home, Dorian. He gave me<br/>everything I wanted, including your best gold-tipped cigarettes. He<br/>is a most hospitable creature. I like him much better than the<br/>Frenchman you used to have. What has become of the Frenchman, by<br/>the bye?"<br/><br/>Dorian shrugged his shoulders. "I believe he married Lady<br/>Radley's maid, and has established her in Paris as an English<br/>dressmaker. Anglomania is very fashionable over there now, I hear.<br/>It seems silly of the French, doesn't it? But—do you know?—he was<br/>not at all a bad servant. I never liked him, but I had nothing to<br/>complain about. One often imagines things that are quite absurd. He<br/>was really very devoted to me and seemed quite sorry when he went<br/>away. Have another brandy-and-soda? Or would you like<br/>hock-and-seltzer? I always take hock-and-seltzer myself. There is<br/>sure to be some in the next room."<br/><br/>"Thanks, I won't have anything more," said the painter, taking<br/>his cap and coat off and throwing them on the bag that he had<br/>placed in the corner. "And now, my dear fellow, I want to speak to<br/>you seriously. Don't frown like that. You make it so much more<br/>difficult for me."<br/><br/>"What is it all about?" cried Dorian in his petulant way,<br/>flinging himself down on the sofa. "I hope it is not about myself.<br/>I am tired of myself to-night. I should like to be somebody<br/>else."<br/><br/>"It is about yourself," answered Hallward in his grave deep<br/>voice, "and I must say it to you. I shall only keep you half an<br/>hour."<br/><br/>Dorian sighed and lit a cigarette. "Half an hour!" he<br/>murmured.<br/><br/>"It is not much to ask of you, Dorian, and it is entirely for<br/>your own sake that I am speaking. I think it right that you should<br/>know that the most dreadful things are being said against you in<br/>London."<br/>
