"I shall be charmed. A visit to Treadley would be a great
privilege. It has a perfect host, and a perfect library."

"You will complete it," answered the old gentleman with a
courteous bow. "And now I must bid good-bye to your excellent aunt.
I am due at the Athenaeum. It is the hour when we sleep there."

"All of you, Mr. Erskine?"

"Forty of us, in forty arm-chairs. We are practising for an
English Academy of Letters."

Lord Henry laughed and rose. "I am going to the park," he
cried.

As he was passing out of the door, Dorian Gray touched him on
the arm. "Let me come with you," he murmured.

"But I thought you had promised Basil Hallward to go and see
him," answered Lord Henry.

"I would sooner come with you; yes, I feel I must come with you.
Do let me. And you will promise to talk to me all the time? No one
talks so wonderfully as you do."

"Ah! I have talked quite enough for to-day," said Lord Henry,
smiling. "All I want now is to look at life. You may come and look
at it with me, if you care to."
