<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>14<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>At nine o'clock the next morning his servant came in with a cup<br/>of chocolate on a tray and opened the shutters. Dorian was sleeping<br/>quite peacefully, lying on his right side, with one hand underneath<br/>his cheek. He looked like a boy who had been tired out with play,<br/>or study.<br/><br/>The man had to touch him twice on the shoulder before he woke,<br/>and as he opened his eyes a faint smile passed across his lips, as<br/>though he had been lost in some delightful dream. Yet he had not<br/>dreamed at all. His night had been untroubled by any images of<br/>pleasure or of pain. But youth smiles without any reason. It is one<br/>of its chiefest charms.<br/><br/>He turned round, and leaning upon his elbow, began to sip his<br/>chocolate. The mellow November sun came streaming into the room.<br/>The sky was bright, and there was a genial warmth in the air. It<br/>was almost like a morning in May.<br/><br/>Gradually the events of the preceding night crept with silent,<br/>blood-stained feet into his brain and reconstructed themselves<br/>there with terrible distinctness. He winced at the memory of all<br/>that he had suffered, and for a moment the same curious feeling of<br/>loathing for Basil Hallward that had made him kill him as he sat in<br/>the chair came back to him, and he grew cold with passion. The dead<br/>man was still sitting there, too, and in the sunlight now. How<br/>horrible that was! Such hideous things were for the darkness, not<br/>for the day.<br/><br/>He felt that if he brooded on what he had gone through he would<br/>sicken or grow mad. There were sins whose fascination was more in<br/>the memory than in the doing of them, strange triumphs that<br/>gratified the pride more than the passions, and gave to the<br/>intellect a quickened sense of joy, greater than any joy they<br/>brought, or could ever bring, to the senses. But this was not one<br/>of them. It was a thing to be driven out of the mind, to be drugged<br/>with poppies, to be strangled lest it might strangle one<br/>itself.<br/><br/>When the half-hour struck, he passed his hand across his<br/>forehead, and then got up hastily and dressed himself with even<br/>more than his usual care, giving a good deal of attention to the<br/>choice of his necktie and scarf-pin and changing his rings more<br/>than once. He spent a long time also over breakfast, tasting the<br/>various dishes, talking to his valet about some new liveries that<br/>he was thinking of getting made for the servants at Selby, and<br/>going through his correspondence. At some of the letters, he<br/>smiled. Three of them bored him. One he read several times over and<br/>then tore up with a slight look of annoyance in his face. "That<br/>awful thing, a woman's memory!" as Lord Henry had once said.<br/><br/>
