<br/>"When is she Sibyl Vane?"<br/><br/>"Never."<br/><br/>"I congratulate you."<br/><br/>"How horrid you are! She is all the great heroines of the world<br/>in one. She is more than an individual. You laugh, but I tell you<br/>she has genius. I love her, and I must make her love me. You, who<br/>know all the secrets of life, tell me how to charm Sibyl Vane to<br/>love me! I want to make Romeo jealous. I want the dead lovers of<br/>the world to hear our laughter and grow sad. I want a breath of our<br/>passion to stir their dust into consciousness, to wake their ashes<br/>into pain. My God, Harry, how I worship her!" He was walking up and<br/>down the room as he spoke. Hectic spots of red burned on his<br/>cheeks. He was terribly excited.<br/><br/>Lord Henry watched him with a subtle sense of pleasure. How<br/>different he was now from the shy frightened boy he had met in<br/>Basil Hallward's studio! His nature had developed like a flower,<br/>had borne blossoms of scarlet flame. Out of its secret hiding-place<br/>had crept his soul, and desire had come to meet it on the way.<br/><br/>"And what do you propose to do?" said Lord Henry at last.<br/><br/>"I want you and Basil to come with me some night and see her<br/>act. I have not the slightest fear of the result. You are certain<br/>to acknowledge her genius. Then we must get her out of the Jew's<br/>hands. She is bound to him for three years—at least for two years<br/>and eight months— from the present time. I shall have to pay him<br/>something, of course. When all that is settled, I shall take a West<br/>End theatre and bring her out properly. She will make the world as<br/>mad as she has made me."<br/><br/>"That would be impossible, my dear boy."<br/><br/>"Yes, she will. She has not merely art, consummate art-instinct,<br/>in her, but she has personality also; and you have often told me<br/>that it is personalities, not principles, that move the age."<br/><br/>"Well, what night shall we go?"<br/><br/>
