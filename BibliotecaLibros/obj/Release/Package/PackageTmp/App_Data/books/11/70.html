He turned round and, walking to the window, drew up the blind.<br/>The bright dawn flooded the room and swept the fantastic shadows<br/>into dusky corners, where they lay shuddering. But the strange<br/>expression that he had noticed in the face of the portrait seemed<br/>to linger there, to be more intensified even. The quivering ardent<br/>sunlight showed him the lines of cruelty round the mouth as clearly<br/>as if he had been looking into a mirror after he had done some<br/>dreadful thing.<br/><br/>He winced and, taking up from the table an oval glass framed in<br/>ivory Cupids, one of Lord Henry's many presents to him, glanced<br/>hurriedly into its polished depths. No line like that warped his<br/>red lips. What did it mean?<br/><br/>He rubbed his eyes, and came close to the picture, and examined<br/>it again. There were no signs of any change when he looked into the<br/>actual painting, and yet there was no doubt that the whole<br/>expression had altered. It was not a mere fancy of his own. The<br/>thing was horribly apparent.<br/><br/>He threw himself into a chair and began to think. Suddenly there<br/>flashed across his mind what he had said in Basil Hallward's studio<br/>the day the picture had been finished. Yes, he remembered it<br/>perfectly. He had uttered a mad wish that he himself might remain<br/>young, and the portrait grow old; that his own beauty might be<br/>untarnished, and the face on the canvas bear the burden of his<br/>passions and his sins; that the painted image might be seared with<br/>the lines of suffering and thought, and that he might keep all the<br/>delicate bloom and loveliness of his then just conscious boyhood.<br/>Surely his wish had not been fulfilled? Such things were<br/>impossible. It seemed monstrous even to think of them. And, yet,<br/>there was the picture before him, with the touch of cruelty in the<br/>mouth.<br/><br/>Cruelty! Had he been cruel? It was the girl's fault, not his. He<br/>had dreamed of her as a great artist, had given his love to her<br/>because he had thought her great. Then she had disappointed him.<br/>She had been shallow and unworthy. And, yet, a feeling of infinite<br/>regret came over him, as he thought of her lying at his feet<br/>sobbing like a little child. He remembered with what callousness he<br/>had watched her. Why had he been made like that? Why had such a<br/>soul been given to him? But he had suffered also. During the three<br/>terrible hours that the play had lasted, he had lived centuries of<br/>pain, aeon upon aeon of torture. His life was well worth hers. She<br/>had marred him for a moment, if he had wounded her for an age.<br/>Besides, women were better suited to bear sorrow than men. They<br/>lived on their emotions. They only thought of their emotions. When<br/>they took lovers, it was merely to have some one with whom they<br/>could have scenes. Lord Henry had told him that, and Lord Henry<br/>knew what women were. Why should he trouble about Sibyl Vane? She<br/>was nothing to him now.<br/><br/>But the picture? What was he to say of that? It held the secret<br/>of his life, and told his story. It had taught him to love his own<br/>beauty. Would it teach him to loathe his own soul? Would he ever<br/>look at it again?<br/><br/>No; it was merely an illusion wrought on the troubled senses.<br/>The horrible night that he had passed had left phantoms behind it.<br/>Suddenly there had fallen upon his brain that tiny scarlet speck<br/>that makes men mad. The picture had not changed. It was folly to<br/>think so.<br/><br/>Yet it was watching him, with its beautiful marred face and its<br/>cruel smile. Its bright hair gleamed in the early sunlight. Its<br/>blue eyes met his own. A sense of infinite pity, not for himself,<br/>but for the painted image of himself, came over him. It had altered<br/>already, and would alter more. Its gold would wither into grey. Its<br/>red and white roses would die. For every sin that he committed, a<br/>stain would fleck and wreck its fairness. But he would not sin. The<br/>picture, changed or unchanged, would be to him the visible emblem<br/>of conscience. He would resist temptation. He would not see Lord<br/>Henry any moreâ€”would not, at any rate, listen to those subtle<br/>poisonous theories that in Basil Hallward's garden had first<br/>stirred within him the passion for impossible things. He would go<br/>back to Sibyl Vane, make her amends, marry her, try to love her<br/>again. Yes, it was his duty to do so. She must have suffered more<br/>than he had. Poor child! He had been selfish and cruel to her. The<br/>fascination that she had exercised over him would return. They<br/>would be happy together. His life with her would be beautiful and<br/>pure.<br/><br/>He got up from his chair and drew a large screen right in front<br/>of the portrait, shuddering as he glanced at it. "How horrible!" he<br/>murmured to himself, and he walked across to the window and opened<br/>it. When he stepped out on to the grass, he drew a deep breath. The<br/>fresh morning air seemed to drive away all his sombre passions. He<br/>thought only of Sibyl. A faint echo of his love came back to him.<br/>He repeated her name over and over again. The birds that were<br/>singing in the dew-drenched garden seemed to be telling the flowers<br/>about her.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
