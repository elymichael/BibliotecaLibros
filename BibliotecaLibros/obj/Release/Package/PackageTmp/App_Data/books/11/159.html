Dorian heaved a sigh, and Lord Henry strolled across the room<br/>and began to stroke the head of a curious Java parrot, a large,<br/>grey-plumaged bird with pink crest and tail, that was balancing<br/>itself upon a bamboo perch. As his pointed fingers touched it, it<br/>dropped the white scurf of crinkled lids over black, glasslike eyes<br/>and began to sway backwards and forwards.<br/><br/>"Yes," he continued, turning round and taking his handkerchief<br/>out of his pocket; "his painting had quite gone off. It seemed to<br/>me to have lost something. It had lost an ideal. When you and he<br/>ceased to be great friends, he ceased to be a great artist. What<br/>was it separated you? I suppose he bored you. If so, he never<br/>forgave you. It's a habit bores have. By the way, what has become<br/>of that wonderful portrait he did of you? I don't think I have ever<br/>seen it since he finished it. Oh! I remember your telling me years<br/>ago that you had sent it down to Selby, and that it had got mislaid<br/>or stolen on the way. You never got it back? What a pity! it was<br/>really a masterpiece. I remember I wanted to buy it. I wish I had<br/>now. It belonged to Basil's best period. Since then, his work was<br/>that curious mixture of bad painting and good intentions that<br/>always entitles a man to be called a representative British artist.<br/>Did you advertise for it? You should."<br/><br/>"I forget," said Dorian. "I suppose I did. But I never really<br/>liked it. I am sorry I sat for it. The memory of the thing is<br/>hateful to me. Why do you talk of it? It used to remind me of those<br/>curious lines in some play—Hamlet, I think—how do they run?— "Like<br/>the painting of a sorrow, A face without a heart."<br/><br/>Yes: that is what it was like."<br/><br/>Lord Henry laughed. "If a man treats life artistically, his<br/>brain is his heart," he answered, sinking into an arm-chair.<br/><br/>Dorian Gray shook his head and struck some soft chords on the<br/>piano. "'Like the painting of a sorrow,'" he repeated, "'a face<br/>without a heart.'"<br/><br/>The elder man lay back and looked at him with half-closed eyes.<br/>"By the way, Dorian," he said after a pause, "'what does it profit<br/>a man if he gain the whole world and lose—how does the quotation<br/>run?— his own soul'?"<br/><br/>The music jarred, and Dorian Gray started and stared at his<br/>friend. "Why do you ask me that, Harry?"<br/><br/>"My dear fellow," said Lord Henry, elevating his eyebrows in<br/>surprise, "I asked you because I thought you might be able to give<br/>me an answer. That is all. I was going through the park last<br/>Sunday, and close by the Marble Arch there stood a little crowd of<br/>shabby-looking people listening to some vulgar street-preacher. As<br/>I passed by, I heard the man yelling out that question to his<br/>audience. It struck me as being rather dramatic. London is very<br/>rich in curious effects of that kind. A wet Sunday, an uncouth<br/>Christian in a mackintosh, a ring of sickly white faces under a<br/>broken roof of dripping umbrellas, and a wonderful phrase flung<br/>into the air by shrill hysterical lips—it was really very good in<br/>its way, quite a suggestion. I thought of telling the prophet that<br/>art had a soul, but that man had not. I am afraid, however, he<br/>would not have understood me."<br/><br/>"Don't, Harry. The soul is a terrible reality. It can be bought,<br/>and sold, and bartered away. It can be poisoned, or made perfect.<br/>There is a soul in each one of us. I know it."<br/><br/>"Do you feel quite sure of that, Dorian?"<br/>
