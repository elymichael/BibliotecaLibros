"My dear fellow, I am not quite serious. But I can't help<br/>detesting my relations. I suppose it comes from the fact that none<br/>of us can stand other people having the same faults as ourselves. I<br/>quite sympathize with the rage of the English democracy against<br/>what they call the vices of the upper orders. The masses feel that<br/>drunkenness, stupidity, and immorality should be their own special<br/>property, and that if any one of us makes an ass of himself, he is<br/>poaching on their preserves. When poor Southwark got into the<br/>divorce court, their indignation was quite magnificent. And yet I<br/>don't suppose that ten per cent of the proletariat live<br/>correctly."<br/><br/>"I don't agree with a single word that you have said, and, what<br/>is more, Harry, I feel sure you don't either."<br/><br/>Lord Henry stroked his pointed brown beard and tapped the toe of<br/>his patent-leather boot with a tasselled ebony cane. "How English<br/>you are Basil! That is the second time you have made that<br/>observation. If one puts forward an idea to a true<br/>Englishman—always a rash thing to do—he never dreams of considering<br/>whether the idea is right or wrong. The only thing he considers of<br/>any importance is whether one believes it oneself. Now, the value<br/>of an idea has nothing whatsoever to do with the sincerity of the<br/>man who expresses it. Indeed, the probabilities are that the more<br/>insincere the man is, the more purely intellectual will the idea<br/>be, as in that case it will not be coloured by either his wants,<br/>his desires, or his prejudices. However, I don't propose to discuss<br/>politics, sociology, or metaphysics with you. I like persons better<br/>than principles, and I like persons with no principles better than<br/>anything else in the world. Tell me more about Mr. Dorian Gray. How<br/>often do you see him?"<br/><br/>"Every day. I couldn't be happy if I didn't see him every day.<br/>He is absolutely necessary to me."<br/><br/>"How extraordinary! I thought you would never care for anything<br/>but your art."<br/><br/>"He is all my art to me now," said the painter gravely. "I<br/>sometimes think, Harry, that there are only two eras of any<br/>importance in the world's history. The first is the appearance of a<br/>new medium for art, and the second is the appearance of a new<br/>personality for art also. What the invention of oil-painting was to<br/>the Venetians, the face of Antinous was to late Greek sculpture,<br/>and the face of Dorian Gray will some day be to me. It is not<br/>merely that I paint from him, draw from him, sketch from him. Of<br/>course, I have done all that. But he is much more to me than a<br/>model or a sitter. I won't tell you that I am dissatisfied with<br/>what I have done of him, or that his beauty is such that art cannot<br/>express it. There is nothing that art cannot express, and I know<br/>that the work I have done, since I met Dorian Gray, is good work,<br/>is the best work of my life. But in some curious way—I wonder will<br/>you understand me?—his personality has suggested to me an entirely<br/>new manner in art, an entirely new mode of style. I see things<br/>differently, I think of them differently. I can now recreate life<br/>in a way that was hidden from me before. 'A dream of form in days<br/>of thought'—who is it who says that? I forget; but it is what<br/>Dorian Gray has been to me. The merely visible presence of this<br/>lad—for he seems to me little more than a lad, though he is really<br/>over twenty— his merely visible presence—ah! I wonder can you<br/>realize all that that means? Unconsciously he defines for me the<br/>lines of a fresh school, a school that is to have in it all the<br/>passion of the romantic spirit, all the perfection of the spirit<br/>that is Greek. The harmony of soul and body— how much that is! We<br/>in our madness have separated the two, and have invented a realism<br/>that is vulgar, an ideality that is void. Harry! if you only knew<br/>what Dorian Gray is to me! You remember that landscape of mine, for<br/>which Agnew offered me such a huge price but which I would not part<br/>with? It is one of the best things I have ever done. And why is it<br/>so? Because, while I was painting it, Dorian Gray sat beside me.<br/>Some subtle influence passed from him to me, and for the first time<br/>in my life I saw in the plain woodland the wonder I had always<br/>looked for and always missed."<br/><br/>"Basil, this is extraordinary! I must see Dorian Gray."<br/><br/>Hallward got up from the seat and walked up and down the garden.<br/>After some time he came back. "Harry," he said, "Dorian Gray is to<br/>me simply a motive in art. You might see nothing in him. I see<br/>everything in him. He is never more present in my work than when no<br/>image of him is there. He is a suggestion, as I have said, of a new<br/>manner. I find him in the curves of certain lines, in the<br/>loveliness and subtleties of certain colours. That is all."<br/><br/>"Then why won't you exhibit his portrait?" asked Lord Henry.<br/><br/>"Because, without intending it, I have put into it some<br/>expression of all this curious artistic idolatry, of which, of<br/>course, I have never cared to speak to him. He knows nothing about<br/>it. He shall never know anything about it. But the world might<br/>guess it, and I will not bare my soul to their shallow prying eyes.<br/>My heart shall never be put under their microscope. There is too<br/>much of myself in the thing, Harry—too much of myself!"<br/><br/>"Poets are not so scrupulous as you are. They know how useful<br/>passion is for publication. Nowadays a broken heart will run to<br/>many editions."<br/>
