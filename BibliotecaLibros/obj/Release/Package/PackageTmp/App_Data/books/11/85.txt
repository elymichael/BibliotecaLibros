"Impossible!"

"You spoil my life as an artist by refusing, Dorian. No man
comes across two ideal things. Few come across one."

"I can't explain it to you, Basil, but I must never sit to you
again. There is something fatal about a portrait. It has a life of
its own. I will come and have tea with you. That will be just as
pleasant."

"Pleasanter for you, I am afraid," murmured Hallward
regretfully. "And now good-bye. I am sorry you won't let me look at
the picture once again. But that can't be helped. I quite
understand what you feel about it."

As he left the room, Dorian Gray smiled to himself. Poor Basil!
How little he knew of the true reason! And bow strange it was that,
instead of having been forced to reveal his own secret, he had
succeeded, almost by chance, in wresting a secret from his friend!
How much that strange confession explained to him! The painter's
absurd fits of jealousy, his wild devotion, his extravagant
panegyrics, his curious reticencesâ€” he understood them all now, and
he felt sorry. There seemed to him to be something tragic in a
friendship so coloured by romance.

He sighed and touched the bell. The portrait must be hidden away
at all costs. He could not run such a risk of discovery again. It
had been mad of him to have allowed the thing to remain, even for
an hour, in a room to which any of his friends had access.
