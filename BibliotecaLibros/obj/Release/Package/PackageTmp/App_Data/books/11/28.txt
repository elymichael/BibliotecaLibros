"Mr. Dorian Gray does not belong to Blue Books, Uncle George,"
said Lord Henry languidly.

"Mr. Dorian Gray? Who is he?" asked Lord Fermor, knitting his
bushy white eyebrows.

"That is what I have come to learn, Uncle George. Or rather, I
know who he is. He is the last Lord Kelso's grandson. His mother
was a Devereux, Lady Margaret Devereaux. I want you to tell me
about his mother. What was she like? Whom did she marry? You have
known nearly everybody in your time, so you might have known her. I
am very much interested in Mr. Gray at present. I have only just
met him."

"Kelso's grandson!" echoed the old gentleman. "Kelso's
grandson!&#160;… Of course… . I knew his mother intimately. I
believe I was at her christening. She was an extraordinarily
beautiful girl, Margaret Devereux, and made all the men frantic by
running away with a penniless young fellow— a mere nobody, sir, a
subaltern in a foot regiment, or something of that kind. Certainly.
I remember the whole thing as if it happened yesterday. The poor
chap was killed in a duel at Spa a few months after the marriage.
There was an ugly story about it. They said Kelso got some rascally
adventurer, some Belgian brute, to insult his son-in-law in
public—paid him, sir, to do it, paid him— and that the fellow
spitted his man as if he had been a pigeon. The thing was hushed
up, but, egad, Kelso ate his chop alone at the club for some time
afterwards. He brought his daughter back with him, I was told, and
she never spoke to him again. Oh, yes; it was a bad business. The
girl died, too, died within a year. So she left a son, did she? I
had forgotten that. What sort of boy is he? If he is like his
mother, he must be a good-looking chap."

"He is very good-looking," assented Lord Henry.

"I hope he will fall into proper hands," continued the old man.
"He should have a pot of money waiting for him if Kelso did the
right thing by him. His mother had money, too. All the Selby
property came to her, through her grandfather. Her grandfather
hated Kelso, thought him a mean dog. He was, too. Came to Madrid
once when I was there. Egad, I was ashamed of him. The Queen used
to ask me about the English noble who was always quarrelling with
the cabmen about their fares. They made quite a story of it. I
didn't dare show my face at Court for a month. I hope he treated
his grandson better than he did the jarvies."

"I don't know," answered Lord Henry. "I fancy that the boy will
be well off. He is not of age yet. He has Selby, I know. He told me
so. And&#160;… his mother was very beautiful?"

"Margaret Devereux was one of the loveliest creatures I ever
saw, Harry. What on earth induced her to behave as she did, I never
could understand. She could have married anybody she chose.
Carlington was mad after her. She was romantic, though. All the
women of that family were. The men were a poor lot, but, egad! the
women were wonderful. Carlington went on his knees to her. Told me
so himself. She laughed at him, and there wasn't a girl in London
at the time who wasn't after him. And by the way, Harry, talking
about silly marriages, what is this humbug your father tells me
about Dartmoor wanting to marry an American? Ain't English girls
good enough for him?"

"It is rather fashionable to marry Americans just now, Uncle
George."

"I'll back English women against the world, Harry," said Lord
Fermor, striking the table with his fist.

"The betting is on the Americans."
