"I have got through all that," said Dorian, shaking his head and<br/>smiling. "I am perfectly happy now. I know what conscience is, to<br/>begin with. It is not what you told me it was. It is the divinest<br/>thing in us. Don't sneer at it, Harry, any more—at least not before<br/>me. I want to be good. I can't bear the idea of my soul being<br/>hideous."<br/><br/>"A very charming artistic basis for ethics, Dorian! I<br/>congratulate you on it. But how are you going to begin?"<br/><br/>"By marrying Sibyl Vane."<br/><br/>"Marrying Sibyl Vane!" cried Lord Henry, standing up and looking<br/>at him in perplexed amazement. "But, my dear Dorian—"<br/><br/>"Yes, Harry, I know what you are going to say. Something<br/>dreadful about marriage. Don't say it. Don't ever say things of<br/>that kind to me again. Two days ago I asked Sibyl to marry me. I am<br/>not going to break my word to her. She is to be my wife."<br/><br/>"Your wife! Dorian!&#160;… Didn't you get my letter? I wrote to<br/>you this morning, and sent the note down by my own man."<br/><br/>"Your letter? Oh, yes, I remember. I have not read it yet,<br/>Harry. I was afraid there might be something in it that I wouldn't<br/>like. You cut life to pieces with your epigrams."<br/><br/>"You know nothing then?"<br/><br/>"What do you mean?"<br/><br/>Lord Henry walked across the room, and sitting down by Dorian<br/>Gray, took both his hands in his own and held them tightly.<br/>"Dorian," he said, "my letter—don't be frightened—was to tell you<br/>that Sibyl Vane is dead."<br/><br/>A cry of pain broke from the lad's lips, and he leaped to his<br/>feet, tearing his hands away from Lord Henry's grasp. "Dead! Sibyl<br/>dead! It is not true! It is a horrible lie! How dare you say<br/>it?"<br/>
