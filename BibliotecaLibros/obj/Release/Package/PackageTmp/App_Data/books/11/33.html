<br/>"Dear me!" said Lady Agatha, "how you men argue! I am sure I<br/>never can make out what you are talking about. Oh! Harry, I am<br/>quite vexed with you. Why do you try to persuade our nice Mr.<br/>Dorian Gray to give up the East End? I assure you he would be quite<br/>invaluable. They would love his playing."<br/><br/>"I want him to play to me," cried Lord Henry, smiling, and he<br/>looked down the table and caught a bright answering glance.<br/><br/>"But they are so unhappy in Whitechapel," continued Lady<br/>Agatha.<br/><br/>"I can sympathize with everything except suffering," said Lord<br/>Henry, shrugging his shoulders. "I cannot sympathize with that. It<br/>is too ugly, too horrible, too distressing. There is something<br/>terribly morbid in the modern sympathy with pain. One should<br/>sympathize with the colour, the beauty, the joy of life. The less<br/>said about life's sores, the better."<br/><br/>"Still, the East End is a very important problem," remarked Sir<br/>Thomas with a grave shake of the head.<br/><br/>"Quite so," answered the young lord. "It is the problem of<br/>slavery, and we try to solve it by amusing the slaves."<br/><br/>The politician looked at him keenly. "What change do you<br/>propose, then?" he asked.<br/><br/>Lord Henry laughed. "I don't desire to change anything in<br/>England except the weather," he answered. "I am quite content with<br/>philosophic contemplation. But, as the nineteenth century has gone<br/>bankrupt through an over-expenditure of sympathy, I would suggest<br/>that we should appeal to science to put us straight. The advantage<br/>of the emotions is that they lead us astray, and the advantage of<br/>science is that it is not emotional."<br/><br/>"But we have such grave responsibilities," ventured Mrs.<br/>Vandeleur timidly.<br/><br/>"Terribly grave," echoed Lady Agatha.<br/><br/>
