"What has the actual lapse of time got to do with it? It is only<br/>shallow people who require years to get rid of an emotion. A man<br/>who is master of himself can end a sorrow as easily as he can<br/>invent a pleasure. I don't want to be at the mercy of my emotions.<br/>I want to use them, to enjoy them, and to dominate them."<br/><br/>"Dorian, this is horrible! Something has changed you completely.<br/>You look exactly the same wonderful boy who, day after day, used to<br/>come down to my studio to sit for his picture. But you were simple,<br/>natural, and affectionate then. You were the most unspoiled<br/>creature in the whole world. Now, I don't know what has come over<br/>you. You talk as if you had no heart, no pity in you. It is all<br/>Harry's influence. I see that."<br/><br/>The lad flushed up and, going to the window, looked out for a<br/>few moments on the green, flickering, sun-lashed garden. "I owe a<br/>great deal to Harry, Basil," he said at last, "more than I owe to<br/>you. You only taught me to be vain."<br/><br/>"Well, I am punished for that, Dorian—or shall be some day."<br/><br/>"I don't know what you mean, Basil," he exclaimed, turning<br/>round. "I don't know what you want. What do you want?"<br/><br/>"I want the Dorian Gray I used to paint," said the artist<br/>sadly.<br/><br/>"Basil," said the lad, going over to him and putting his hand on<br/>his shoulder, "you have come too late. Yesterday, when I heard that<br/>Sibyl Vane had killed herself—"<br/><br/>"Killed herself! Good heavens! is there no doubt about that?"<br/>cried Hallward, looking up at him with an expression of horror.<br/><br/>"My dear Basil! Surely you don't think it was a vulgar accident?<br/>Of course she killed herself."<br/><br/>The elder man buried his face in his hands. "How fearful," he<br/>muttered, and a shudder ran through him.<br/><br/>"No," said Dorian Gray, "there is nothing fearful about it. It<br/>is one of the great romantic tragedies of the age. As a rule,<br/>people who act lead the most commonplace lives. They are good<br/>husbands, or faithful wives, or something tedious. You know what I<br/>mean—middle-class virtue and all that kind of thing. How different<br/>Sibyl was! She lived her finest tragedy. She was always a heroine.<br/>The last night she played— the night you saw her—she acted badly<br/>because she had known the reality of love. When she knew its<br/>unreality, she died, as Juliet might have died. She passed again<br/>into the sphere of art. There is something of the martyr about her.<br/>Her death has all the pathetic uselessness of martyrdom, all its<br/>wasted beauty. But, as I was saying, you must not think I have not<br/>suffered. If you had come in yesterday at a particular moment—<br/>about half-past five, perhaps, or a quarter to six— you would have<br/>found me in tears. Even Harry, who was here, who brought me the<br/>news, in fact, had no idea what I was going through. I suffered<br/>immensely. Then it passed away. I cannot repeat an emotion. No one<br/>can, except sentimentalists. And you are awfully unjust, Basil. You<br/>come down here to console me. That is charming of you. You find me<br/>consoled, and you are furious. How like a sympathetic person! You<br/>remind me of a story Harry told me about a certain philanthropist<br/>who spent twenty years of his life in trying to get some grievance<br/>redressed, or some unjust law altered—I forget exactly what it was.<br/>Finally he succeeded, and nothing could exceed his disappointment.<br/>He had absolutely nothing to do, almost died of ennui, and became a<br/>confirmed misanthrope. And besides, my dear old Basil, if you<br/>really want to console me, teach me rather to forget what has<br/>happened, or to see it from a proper artistic point of view. Was it<br/>not Gautier who used to write about la consolation des arts? I<br/>remember picking up a little vellum-covered book in your studio one<br/>day and chancing on that delightful phrase. Well, I am not like<br/>that young man you told me of when we were down at Marlow together,<br/>the young man who used to say that yellow satin could console one<br/>for all the miseries of life. I love beautiful things that one can<br/>touch and handle. Old brocades, green bronzes, lacquer-work, carved<br/>ivories, exquisite surroundings, luxury, pomp—there is much to be<br/>got from all these. But the artistic temperament that they create,<br/>or at any rate reveal, is still more to me. To become the spectator<br/>of one's own life, as Harry says, is to escape the suffering of<br/>life. I know you are surprised at my talking to you like this. You<br/>have not realized how I have developed. I was a schoolboy when you<br/>knew me. I am a man now. I have new passions, new thoughts, new<br/>ideas. I am different, but you must not like me less. I am changed,<br/>but you must always be my friend. Of course, I am very fond of<br/>Harry. But I know that you are better than he is. You are not<br/>stronger— you are too much afraid of life—but you are better. And<br/>how happy we used to be together! Don't leave me, Basil, and don't<br/>quarrel with me. I am what I am. There is nothing more to be<br/>said."<br/>
