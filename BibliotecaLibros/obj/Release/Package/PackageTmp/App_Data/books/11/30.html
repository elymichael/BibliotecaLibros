"Where are you lunching, Harry?"<br/><br/>"At Aunt Agatha's. I have asked myself and Mr. Gray. He is her<br/>latest protege."<br/><br/>"Humph! tell your Aunt Agatha, Harry, not to bother me any more<br/>with her charity appeals. I am sick of them. Why, the good woman<br/>thinks that I have nothing to do but to write cheques for her silly<br/>fads."<br/><br/>"All right, Uncle George, I'll tell her, but it won't have any<br/>effect. Philanthropic people lose all sense of humanity. It is<br/>their distinguishing characteristic."<br/><br/>The old gentleman growled approvingly and rang the bell for his<br/>servant. Lord Henry passed up the low arcade into Burlington Street<br/>and turned his steps in the direction of Berkeley Square.<br/><br/>So that was the story of Dorian Gray's parentage. Crudely as it<br/>had been told to him, it had yet stirred him by its suggestion of a<br/>strange, almost modern romance. A beautiful woman risking<br/>everything for a mad passion. A few wild weeks of happiness cut<br/>short by a hideous, treacherous crime. Months of voiceless agony,<br/>and then a child born in pain. The mother snatched away by death,<br/>the boy left to solitude and the tyranny of an old and loveless<br/>man. Yes; it was an interesting background. It posed the lad, made<br/>him more perfect, as it were. Behind every exquisite thing that<br/>existed, there was something tragic. Worlds had to be in travail,<br/>that the meanest flower might blow… . And how charming he had been<br/>at dinner the night before, as with startled eyes and lips parted<br/>in frightened pleasure he had sat opposite to him at the club, the<br/>red candleshades staining to a richer rose the wakening wonder of<br/>his face. Talking to him was like playing upon an exquisite violin.<br/>He answered to every touch and thrill of the bow… . There was<br/>something terribly enthralling in the exercise of influence. No<br/>other activity was like it. To project one's soul into some<br/>gracious form, and let it tarry there for a moment; to hear one's<br/>own intellectual views echoed back to one with all the added music<br/>of passion and youth; to convey one's temperament into another as<br/>though it were a subtle fluid or a strange perfume: there was a<br/>real joy in that—perhaps the most satisfying joy left to us in an<br/>age so limited and vulgar as our own, an age grossly carnal in its<br/>pleasures, and grossly common in its aims… . He was a marvellous<br/>type, too, this lad, whom by so curious a chance he had met in<br/>Basil's studio, or could be fashioned into a marvellous type, at<br/>any rate. Grace was his, and the white purity of boyhood, and<br/>beauty such as old Greek marbles kept for us. There was nothing<br/>that one could not do with him. He could be made a Titan or a toy.<br/>What a pity it was that such beauty was destined to fade!&#160;…<br/>And Basil? From a psychological point of view, how interesting he<br/>was! The new manner in art, the fresh mode of looking at life,<br/>suggested so strangely by the merely visible presence of one who<br/>was unconscious of it all; the silent spirit that dwelt in dim<br/>woodland, and walked unseen in open field, suddenly showing<br/>herself, Dryadlike and not afraid, because in his soul who sought<br/>for her there had been wakened that wonderful vision to which alone<br/>are wonderful things revealed; the mere shapes and patterns of<br/>things becoming, as it were, refined, and gaining a kind of<br/>symbolical value, as though they were themselves patterns of some<br/>other and more perfect form whose shadow they made real: how<br/>strange it all was! He remembered something like it in history. Was<br/>it not Plato, that artist in thought, who had first analyzed it?<br/>Was it not Buonarotti who had carved it in the coloured marbles of<br/>a sonnet-sequence? But in our own century it was strange… . Yes; he<br/>would try to be to Dorian Gray what, without knowing it, the lad<br/>was to the painter who had fashioned the wonderful portrait. He<br/>would seek to dominate him—had already, indeed, half done so. He<br/>would make that wonderful spirit his own. There was something<br/>fascinating in this son of love and death.<br/><br/>Suddenly he stopped and glanced up at the houses. He found that<br/>he had passed his aunt's some distance, and, smiling to himself,<br/>turned back. When he entered the somewhat sombre hall, the butler<br/>told him that they had gone in to lunch. He gave one of the footmen<br/>his hat and stick and passed into the dining-room.<br/><br/>"Late as usual, Harry," cried his aunt, shaking her head at<br/>him.<br/><br/>He invented a facile excuse, and having taken the vacant seat<br/>next to her, looked round to see who was there. Dorian bowed to him<br/>shyly from the end of the table, a flush of pleasure stealing into<br/>his cheek. Opposite was the Duchess of Harley, a lady of admirable<br/>good-nature and good temper, much liked by every one who knew her,<br/>and of those ample architectural proportions that in women who are<br/>not duchesses are described by contemporary historians as<br/>stoutness. Next to her sat, on her right, Sir Thomas Burdon, a<br/>Radical member of Parliament, who followed his leader in public<br/>life and in private life followed the best cooks, dining with the<br/>Tories and thinking with the Liberals, in accordance with a wise<br/>and well-known rule. The post on her left was occupied by Mr.<br/>Erskine of Treadley, an old gentleman of considerable charm and<br/>culture, who had fallen, however, into bad habits of silence,<br/>having, as he explained once to Lady Agatha, said everything that<br/>he had to say before he was thirty. His own neighbour was Mrs.<br/>Vandeleur, one of his aunt's oldest friends, a perfect saint<br/>amongst women, but so dreadfully dowdy that she reminded one of a<br/>badly bound hymn-book. Fortunately for him she had on the other<br/>side Lord Faudel, a most intelligent middle-aged mediocrity, as<br/>bald as a ministerial statement in the House of Commons, with whom<br/>she was conversing in that intensely earnest manner which is the<br/>one unpardonable error, as he remarked once himself, that all<br/>really good people fall into, and from which none of them ever<br/>quite escape.<br/><br/>"We are talking about poor Dartmoor, Lord Henry," cried the<br/>duchess, nodding pleasantly to him across the table. "Do you think<br/>he will really marry this fascinating young person?"<br/><br/>"I believe she has made up her mind to propose to him,<br/>Duchess."<br/>
