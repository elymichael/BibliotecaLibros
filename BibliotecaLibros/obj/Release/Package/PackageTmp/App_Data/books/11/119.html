Upon my word that is trop de zele."<br/><br/>"Trop d'audace, I tell her," said Dorian.<br/><br/>"Oh! she is audacious enough for anything, my dear. And what is<br/>Ferrol like? I don't know him."<br/><br/>"The husbands of very beautiful women belong to the criminal<br/>classes," said Lord Henry, sipping his wine.<br/><br/>Lady Narborough hit him with her fan.
