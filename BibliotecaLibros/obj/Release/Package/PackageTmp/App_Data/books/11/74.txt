"I have got through all that," said Dorian, shaking his head and
smiling. "I am perfectly happy now. I know what conscience is, to
begin with. It is not what you told me it was. It is the divinest
thing in us. Don't sneer at it, Harry, any more—at least not before
me. I want to be good. I can't bear the idea of my soul being
hideous."

"A very charming artistic basis for ethics, Dorian! I
congratulate you on it. But how are you going to begin?"

"By marrying Sibyl Vane."

"Marrying Sibyl Vane!" cried Lord Henry, standing up and looking
at him in perplexed amazement. "But, my dear Dorian—"

"Yes, Harry, I know what you are going to say. Something
dreadful about marriage. Don't say it. Don't ever say things of
that kind to me again. Two days ago I asked Sibyl to marry me. I am
not going to break my word to her. She is to be my wife."

"Your wife! Dorian!&#160;… Didn't you get my letter? I wrote to
you this morning, and sent the note down by my own man."

"Your letter? Oh, yes, I remember. I have not read it yet,
Harry. I was afraid there might be something in it that I wouldn't
like. You cut life to pieces with your epigrams."

"You know nothing then?"

"What do you mean?"

Lord Henry walked across the room, and sitting down by Dorian
Gray, took both his hands in his own and held them tightly.
"Dorian," he said, "my letter—don't be frightened—was to tell you
that Sibyl Vane is dead."

A cry of pain broke from the lad's lips, and he leaped to his
feet, tearing his hands away from Lord Henry's grasp. "Dead! Sibyl
dead! It is not true! It is a horrible lie! How dare you say
it?"
