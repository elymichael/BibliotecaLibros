<br/>"Ah! but you don't like being kissed, Jim," she cried. "You are<br/>a dreadful old bear." And she ran across the room and hugged<br/>him.<br/><br/>James Vane looked into his sister's face with tenderness. "I<br/>want you to come out with me for a walk, Sibyl. I don't suppose I<br/>shall ever see this horrid London again. I am sure I don't want<br/>to."<br/><br/>"My son, don't say such dreadful things," murmured Mrs. Vane,<br/>taking up a tawdry theatrical dress, with a sigh, and beginning to<br/>patch it. She felt a little disappointed that he had not joined the<br/>group. It would have increased the theatrical picturesqueness of<br/>the situation.<br/><br/>"Why not, Mother? I mean it."<br/><br/>"You pain me, my son. I trust you will return from Australia in<br/>a position of affluence. I believe there is no society of any kind<br/>in the Colonies— nothing that I would call society—so when you have<br/>made your fortune, you must come back and assert yourself in<br/>London."<br/><br/>"Society!" muttered the lad.

But are you<br/>really going for a walk with me? That will be nice! I was afraid<br/>you were going to say good-bye to some of your friends— to Tom<br/>Hardy, who gave you that hideous pipe, or Ned Langton, who makes<br/>fun of you for smoking it. It is very sweet of you to let me have<br/>your last afternoon. Where shall we go? Let us go to the park."<br/><br/>"I am too shabby," he answered, frowning. "Only swell people go<br/>to the park."<br/><br/>"Nonsense, Jim," she whispered, stroking the sleeve of his<br/>coat.<br/><br/>He hesitated for a moment. "Very well," he said at last, "but<br/>don't be too long dressing." She danced out of the door. One could<br/>hear her singing as she ran upstairs. Her little feet pattered<br/>overhead.<br/><br/>
