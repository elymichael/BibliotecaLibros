<br/>"Dorian," said Lord Henry, "I had better tell them that the<br/>shooting is stopped for to-day. It would not look well to go<br/>on."<br/><br/>"I wish it were stopped for ever, Harry," he answered bitterly.<br/>"The whole thing is hideous and cruel. Is the man&#160;â€¦<br/>&#160;?"<br/><br/>He could not finish the sentence.<br/><br/>"I am afraid so," rejoined Lord Henry. "He got the whole charge<br/>of shot in his chest. He must have died almost instantaneously.<br/>Come; let us go home."<br/><br/>They walked side by side in the direction of the avenue for<br/>nearly fifty yards without speaking. Then Dorian looked at Lord<br/>Henry and said, with a heavy sigh, "It is a bad omen, Harry, a very<br/>bad omen."<br/><br/>"What is?" asked Lord Henry. "Oh! this accident, I suppose. My<br/>dear fellow, it can't be helped. It was the man's own fault. Why<br/>did he get in front of the guns? Besides, it is nothing to us. It<br/>is rather awkward for Geoffrey, of course. It does not do to pepper<br/>beaters. It makes people think that one is a wild shot. And<br/>Geoffrey is not; he shoots very straight. But there is no use<br/>talking about the matter."<br/><br/>Dorian shook his head. "It is a bad omen, Harry. I feel as if<br/>something horrible were going to happen to some of us. To myself,<br/>perhaps," he added, passing his hand over his eyes, with a gesture<br/>of pain.<br/><br/>The elder man laughed. "The only horrible thing in the world is<br/>ennui, Dorian. That is the one sin for which there is no<br/>forgiveness. But we are not likely to suffer from it unless these<br/>fellows keep chattering about this thing at dinner. I must tell<br/>them that the subject is to be tabooed. As for omens, there is no<br/>such thing as an omen. Destiny does not send us heralds. She is too<br/>wise or too cruel for that. Besides, what on earth could happen to<br/>you, Dorian? You have everything in the world that a man can want.<br/>There is no one who would not be delighted to change places with<br/>you."<br/><br/>"There is no one with whom I would not change places, Harry.<br/>Don't laugh like that. I am telling you the truth. The wretched<br/>peasant who has just died is better off than I am. I have no terror<br/>of death. It is the coming of death that terrifies me. Its<br/>monstrous wings seem to wheel in the leaden air around me. Good<br/>heavens! don't you see a man moving behind the trees there,<br/>watching me, waiting for me?"<br/><br/>Lord Henry looked in the direction in which the trembling gloved<br/>hand was pointing. "Yes," he said, smiling, "I see the gardener<br/>waiting for you. I suppose he wants to ask you what flowers you<br/>wish to have on the table to-night. How absurdly nervous you are,<br/>my dear fellow! You must come and see my doctor, when we get back<br/>to town."<br/><br/>
