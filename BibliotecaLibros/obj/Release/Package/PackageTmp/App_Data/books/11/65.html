<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>7<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>For some reason or other, the house was crowded that night, and<br/>the fat Jew manager who met them at the door was beaming from ear<br/>to ear with an oily tremulous smile. He escorted them to their box<br/>with a sort of pompous humility, waving his fat jewelled hands and<br/>talking at the top of his voice. Dorian Gray loathed him more than<br/>ever. He felt as if he had come to look for Miranda and had been<br/>met by Caliban. Lord Henry, upon the other hand, rather liked him.<br/>At least he declared he did, and insisted on shaking him by the<br/>hand and assuring him that he was proud to meet a man who had<br/>discovered a real genius and gone bankrupt over a poet. Hallward<br/>amused himself with watching the faces in the pit. The heat was<br/>terribly oppressive, and the huge sunlight flamed like a monstrous<br/>dahlia with petals of yellow fire. The youths in the gallery had<br/>taken off their coats and waistcoats and hung them over the side.<br/>They talked to each other across the theatre and shared their<br/>oranges with the tawdry girls who sat beside them. Some women were<br/>laughing in the pit. Their voices were horribly shrill and<br/>discordant. The sound of the popping of corks came from the<br/>bar.<br/><br/>"What a place to find one's divinity in!" said Lord Henry.<br/><br/>"Yes!" answered Dorian Gray. "It was here I found her, and she<br/>is divine beyond all living things. When she acts, you will forget<br/>everything. These common rough people, with their coarse faces and<br/>brutal gestures, become quite different when she is on the stage.<br/>They sit silently and watch her. They weep and laugh as she wills<br/>them to do. She makes them as responsive as a violin. She<br/>spiritualizes them, and one feels that they are of the same flesh<br/>and blood as one's self."<br/><br/>"The same flesh and blood as one's self! Oh, I hope not!"<br/>exclaimed Lord Henry, who was scanning the occupants of the gallery<br/>through his opera-glass.<br/><br/>"Don't pay any attention to him, Dorian," said the painter. "I<br/>understand what you mean, and I believe in this girl. Any one you<br/>love must be marvellous, and any girl who has the effect you<br/>describe must be fine and noble. To spiritualize one's ageâ€”that is<br/>something worth doing. If this girl can give a soul to those who<br/>have lived without one, if she can create the sense of beauty in<br/>people whose lives have been sordid and ugly, if she can strip them<br/>of their selfishness and lend them tears for sorrows that are not<br/>their own, she is worthy of all your adoration, worthy of the<br/>adoration of the world. This marriage is quite right. I did not<br/>think so at first, but I admit it now. The gods made Sibyl Vane for<br/>you. Without her you would have been incomplete."<br/><br/>"Thanks, Basil," answered Dorian Gray, pressing his hand. "I<br/>knew that you would understand me. Harry is so cynical, he<br/>terrifies me. But here is the orchestra. It is quite dreadful, but<br/>it only lasts for about five minutes. Then the curtain rises, and<br/>you will see the girl to whom I am going to give all my life, to<br/>whom I have given everything that is good in me."<br/><br/>
