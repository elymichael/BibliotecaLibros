Lord Henry looked over at Mr. Erskine. "Humanity takes itself<br/>too seriously. It is the world's original sin. If the caveman had<br/>known how to laugh, history would have been different."<br/><br/>"You are really very comforting," warbled the duchess. "I have<br/>always felt rather guilty when I came to see your dear aunt, for I<br/>take no interest at all in the East End. For the future I shall be<br/>able to look her in the face without a blush."<br/><br/>"A blush is very becoming, Duchess," remarked Lord Henry.<br/><br/>"Only when one is young," she answered. "When an old woman like<br/>myself blushes, it is a very bad sign. Ah! Lord Henry, I wish you<br/>would tell me how to become young again."<br/><br/>He thought for a moment. "Can you remember any great error that<br/>you committed in your early days, Duchess?" he asked, looking at<br/>her across the table.<br/><br/>"A great many, I fear," she cried.<br/><br/>"Then commit them over again," he said gravely. "To get back<br/>one's youth, one has merely to repeat one's follies."<br/><br/>"A delightful theory!" she exclaimed. "I must put it into<br/>practice."<br/><br/>"A dangerous theory!" came from Sir Thomas's tight lips. Lady<br/>Agatha shook her head, but could not help being amused. Mr. Erskine<br/>listened.<br/><br/>"Yes," he continued, "that is one of the great secrets of life.<br/>Nowadays most people die of a sort of creeping common sense, and<br/>discover when it is too late that the only things one never regrets<br/>are one's mistakes."<br/><br/>A laugh ran round the table.<br/>
