<br/>Dorian walked to the door with a look of pain in his face. As he<br/>drew the curtain aside, a hideous laugh broke from the painted lips<br/>of the woman who had taken his money. "There goes the devil's<br/>bargain!" she hiccoughed, in a hoarse voice.<br/><br/>"Curse you!" he answered, "don't call me that."<br/><br/>She snapped her fingers. "Prince Charming is what you like to be<br/>called, ain't it?" she yelled after him.<br/><br/>The drowsy sailor leaped to his feet as she spoke, and looked<br/>wildly round. The sound of the shutting of the hall door fell on<br/>his ear. He rushed out as if in pursuit.<br/><br/>Dorian Gray hurried along the quay through the drizzling rain.<br/>His meeting with Adrian Singleton had strangely moved him, and he<br/>wondered if the ruin of that young life was really to be laid at<br/>his door, as Basil Hallward had said to him with such infamy of<br/>insult. He bit his lip, and for a few seconds his eyes grew sad.<br/>Yet, after all, what did it matter to him? One's days were too<br/>brief to take the burden of another's errors on one's shoulders.<br/>Each man lived his own life and paid his own price for living it.<br/>The only pity was one had to pay so often for a single fault. One<br/>had to pay over and over again, indeed. In her dealings with man,<br/>destiny never closed her accounts.<br/><br/>There are moments, psychologists tell us, when the passion for<br/>sin, or for what the world calls sin, so dominates a nature that<br/>every fibre of the body, as every cell of the brain, seems to be<br/>instinct with fearful impulses. Men and women at such moments lose<br/>the freedom of their will. They move to their terrible end as<br/>automatons move. Choice is taken from them, and conscience is<br/>either killed, or, if it lives at all, lives but to give rebellion<br/>its fascination and disobedience its charm. For all sins, as<br/>theologians weary not of reminding us, are sins of disobedience.<br/>When that high spirit, that morning star of evil, fell from heaven,<br/>it was as a rebel that he fell.<br/><br/>Callous, concentrated on evil, with stained mind, and soul<br/>hungry for rebellion, Dorian Gray hastened on, quickening his step<br/>as he went, but as he darted aside into a dim archway, that had<br/>served him often as a short cut to the ill-famed place where he was<br/>going, he felt himself suddenly seized from behind, and before be<br/>had time to defend himself, he was thrust back against the wall,<br/>with a brutal hand round his throat.<br/><br/>He struggled madly for life, and by a terrible effort wrenched<br/>the tightening fingers away. In a second he heard the click of a<br/>revolver, and saw the gleam of a polished barrel, pointing straight<br/>at his head, and the dusky form of a short, thick-set man facing<br/>him.<br/><br/>"What do you want?" he gasped.<br/><br/>"Keep quiet," said the man. "If you stir, I shoot you."<br/><br/>
