Dorian winced and looked round at the grotesque things that lay
in such fantastic postures on the ragged mattresses. The twisted
limbs, the gaping mouths, the staring lustreless eyes, fascinated
him. He knew in what strange heavens they were suffering, and what
dull hells were teaching them the secret of some new joy. They were
better off than he was. He was prisoned in thought. Memory, like a
horrible malady, was eating his soul away. From time to time he
seemed to see the eyes of Basil Hallward looking at him. Yet he
felt he could not stay. The presence of Adrian Singleton troubled
him. He wanted to be where no one would know who he was. He wanted
to escape from himself.

"I am going on to the other place," he said after a pause.

"On the wharf?"

"Yes."

"That mad-cat is sure to be there. They won't have her in this
place now."

Dorian shrugged his shoulders. "I am sick of women who love one.
Women who hate one are much more interesting. Besides, the stuff is
better."

"Much the same."

"I like it better. Come and have something to drink. I must have
something."
