<br/>He played with the idea and grew wilful; tossed it into the air<br/>and transformed it; let it escape and recaptured it; made it<br/>iridescent with fancy and winged it with paradox. The praise of<br/>folly, as he went on, soared into a philosophy, and philosophy<br/>herself became young, and catching the mad music of pleasure,<br/>wearing, one might fancy, her wine-stained robe and wreath of ivy,<br/>danced like a Bacchante over the hills of life, and mocked the slow<br/>Silenus for being sober. Facts fled before her like frightened<br/>forest things. Her white feet trod the huge press at which wise<br/>Omar sits, till the seething grape-juice rose round her bare limbs<br/>in waves of purple bubbles, or crawled in red foam over the vat's<br/>black, dripping, sloping sides. It was an extraordinary<br/>improvisation. He felt that the eyes of Dorian Gray were fixed on<br/>him, and the consciousness that amongst his audience there was one<br/>whose temperament he wished to fascinate seemed to give his wit<br/>keenness and to lend colour to his imagination. He was brilliant,<br/>fantastic, irresponsible. He charmed his listeners out of<br/>themselves, and they followed his pipe, laughing. Dorian Gray never<br/>took his gaze off him, but sat like one under a spell, smiles<br/>chasing each other over his lips and wonder growing grave in his<br/>darkening eyes.<br/><br/>At last, liveried in the costume of the age, reality entered the<br/>room in the shape of a servant to tell the duchess that her<br/>carriage was waiting. She wrung her hands in mock despair. "How<br/>annoying!" she cried. "I must go. I have to call for my husband at<br/>the club, to take him to some absurd meeting at Willis's Rooms,<br/>where he is going to be in the chair. If I am late he is sure to be<br/>furious, and I couldn't have a scene in this bonnet. It is far too<br/>fragile. A harsh word would ruin it. No, I must go, dear Agatha.<br/>Good-bye, Lord Henry, you are quite delightful and dreadfully<br/>demoralizing. I am sure I don't know what to say about your views.<br/>You must come and dine with us some night. Tuesday? Are you<br/>disengaged Tuesday?"<br/><br/>"For you I would throw over anybody, Duchess," said Lord Henry<br/>with a bow.<br/><br/>"Ah! that is very nice, and very wrong of you," she cried; "so<br/>mind you come"; and she swept out of the room, followed by Lady<br/>Agatha and the other ladies.<br/><br/>When Lord Henry had sat down again, Mr. Erskine moved round, and<br/>taking a chair close to him, placed his hand upon his arm.<br/><br/>"You talk books away," he said; "why don't you write one?"<br/><br/>"I am too fond of reading books to care to write them, Mr.<br/>Erskine. I should like to write a novel certainly, a novel that<br/>would be as lovely as a Persian carpet and as unreal. But there is<br/>no literary public in England for anything except newspapers,<br/>primers, and encyclopaedias. Of all people in the world the English<br/>have the least sense of the beauty of literature."<br/><br/>"I fear you are right," answered Mr. Erskine. "I myself used to<br/>have literary ambitions, but I gave them up long ago. And now, my<br/>dear young friend, if you will allow me to call you so, may I ask<br/>if you really meant all that you said to us at lunch?"<br/><br/>"I quite forget what I said," smiled Lord Henry. "Was it all<br/>very bad?"<br/><br/>"Very bad indeed. In fact I consider you extremely dangerous,<br/>and if anything happens to our good duchess, we shall all look on<br/>you as being primarily responsible. But I should like to talk to<br/>you about life. The generation into which I was born was tedious.<br/>Some day, when you are tired of London, come down to Treadley and<br/>expound to me your philosophy of pleasure over some admirable<br/>Burgundy I am fortunate enough to possess."<br/><br/>
