It was on the ninth of November, the eve of his own
thirty-eighth birthday, as he often remembered afterwards.

He was walking home about eleven o'clock from Lord Henry's,
where he had been dining, and was wrapped in heavy furs, as the
night was cold and foggy. At the corner of Grosvenor Square and
South Audley Street, a man passed him in the mist, walking very
fast and with the collar of his grey ulster turned up. He had a bag
in his hand. Dorian recognized him. It was Basil Hallward. A
strange sense of fear, for which he could not account, came over
him. He made no sign of recognition and went on quickly in the
direction of his own house.

But Hallward had seen him. Dorian heard him first stopping on
the pavement and then hurrying after him. In a few moments, his
hand was on his arm.

"Dorian! What an extraordinary piece of luck! I have been
waiting for you in your library ever since nine o'clock. Finally I
took pity on your tired servant and told him to go to bed, as he
let me out. I am off to Paris by the midnight train, and I
particularly wanted to see you before I left. I thought it was you,
or rather your fur coat, as you passed me. But I wasn't quite sure.
Didn't you recognize me?"

"In this fog, my dear Basil? Why, I can't even recognize
Grosvenor Square. I believe my house is somewhere about here, but I
don't feel at all certain about it. I am sorry you are going away,
as I have not seen you for ages. But I suppose you will be back
soon?"

"No: I am going to be out of England for six months. I intend to
take a studio in Paris and shut myself up till I have finished a
great picture I have in my head. However, it wasn't about myself I
wanted to talk. Here we are at your door. Let me come in for a
moment. I have something to say to you."
