<br/>"Then he asked me if I wrote for any of the newspapers. I told<br/>him I never even read them. He seemed terribly disappointed at<br/>that, and confided to me that all the dramatic critics were in a<br/>conspiracy against him, and that they were every one of them to be<br/>bought."<br/><br/>"I should not wonder if he was quite right there. But, on the<br/>other hand, judging from their appearance, most of them cannot be<br/>at all expensive."<br/><br/>"Well, he seemed to think they were beyond his means," laughed<br/>Dorian. "By this time, however, the lights were being put out in<br/>the theatre, and I had to go. He wanted me to try some cigars that<br/>he strongly recommended. I declined. The next night, of course, I<br/>arrived at the place again. When he saw me, he made me a low bow<br/>and assured me that I was a munificent patron of art. He was a most<br/>offensive brute, though he had an extraordinary passion for<br/>Shakespeare. He told me once, with an air of pride, that his five<br/>bankruptcies were entirely due to 'The Bard,' as he insisted on<br/>calling him. He seemed to think it a distinction."<br/><br/>"It was a distinction, my dear Dorian—a great distinction. Most<br/>people become bankrupt through having invested too heavily in the<br/>prose of life. To have ruined one's self over poetry is an honour.<br/>But when did you first speak to Miss Sibyl Vane?"<br/><br/>"The third night. She had been playing Rosalind. I could not<br/>help going round. I had thrown her some flowers, and she had looked<br/>at me—at least I fancied that she had. The old Jew was persistent.<br/>He seemed determined to take me behind, so I consented. It was<br/>curious my not wanting to know her, wasn't it?"<br/><br/>"No; I don't think so."<br/><br/>"My dear Harry, why?"<br/><br/>"I will tell you some other time. Now I want to know about the<br/>girl."<br/><br/>"Sibyl? Oh, she was so shy and so gentle. There is something of<br/>a child about her. Her eyes opened wide in exquisite wonder when I<br/>told her what I thought of her performance, and she seemed quite<br/>unconscious of her power. I think we were both rather nervous. The<br/>old Jew stood grinning at the doorway of the dusty greenroom,<br/>making elaborate speeches about us both, while we stood looking at<br/>each other like children. He would insist on calling me 'My Lord,'<br/>so I had to assure Sibyl that I was not anything of the kind. She<br/>said quite simply to me, 'You look more like a prince. I must call<br/>you Prince Charming.'"<br/><br/>"Upon my word, Dorian, Miss Sibyl knows how to pay<br/>compliments."<br/><br/>
