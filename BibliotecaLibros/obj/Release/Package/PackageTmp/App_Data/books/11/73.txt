Three o'clock struck, and four, and the half-hour rang its
double chime, but Dorian Gray did not stir. He was trying to gather
up the scarlet threads of life and to weave them into a pattern; to
find his way through the sanguine labyrinth of passion through
which he was wandering. He did not know what to do, or what to
think. Finally, he went over to the table and wrote a passionate
letter to the girl he had loved, imploring her forgiveness and
accusing himself of madness. He covered page after page with wild
words of sorrow and wilder words of pain. There is a luxury in
self-reproach. When we blame ourselves, we feel that no one else
has a right to blame us. It is the confession, not the priest, that
gives us absolution. When Dorian had finished the letter, he felt
that he had been forgiven.

Suddenly there came a knock to the door, and he heard Lord
Henry's voice outside. "My dear boy, I must see you. Let me in at
once. I can't bear your shutting yourself up like this."

He made no answer at first, but remained quite still. The
knocking still continued and grew louder. Yes, it was better to let
Lord Henry in, and to explain to him the new life he was going to
lead, to quarrel with him if it became necessary to quarrel, to
part if parting was inevitable. He jumped up, drew the screen
hastily across the picture, and unlocked the door.

"I am so sorry for it all, Dorian," said Lord Henry as he
entered. "But you must not think too much about it."

"Do you mean about Sibyl Vane?" asked the lad.

"Yes, of course," answered Lord Henry, sinking into a chair and
slowly pulling off his yellow gloves. "It is dreadful, from one
point of view, but it was not your fault. Tell me, did you go
behind and see her, after the play was over?"

"Yes."

"I felt sure you had. Did you make a scene with her?"

"I was brutal, Harryâ€”perfectly brutal. But it is all right now.
I am not sorry for anything that has happened. It has taught me to
know myself better."

"Ah, Dorian, I am so glad you take it in that way! I was afraid
I would find you plunged in remorse and tearing that nice curly
hair of yours."
