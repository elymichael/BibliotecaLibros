"You refuse?"

"Yes."

"I entreat you, Alan."

"It is useless."

The same look of pity came into Dorian Gray's eyes. Then he
stretched out his hand, took a piece of paper, and wrote something
on it. He read it over twice, folded it carefully, and pushed it
across the table. Having done this, he got up and went over to the
window.

Campbell looked at him in surprise, and then took up the paper,
and opened it. As he read it, his face became ghastly pale and he
fell back in his chair. A horrible sense of sickness came over him.
He felt as if his heart was beating itself to death in some empty
hollow.

After two or three minutes of terrible silence, Dorian turned
round and came and stood behind him, putting his hand upon his
shoulder.

"I am so sorry for you, Alan," he murmured, "but you leave me no
alternative. I have a letter written already. Here it is. You see
the address. If you don't help me, I must send it. If you don't
help me, I will send it. You know what the result will be. But you
are going to help me. It is impossible for you to refuse now. I
tried to spare you. You will do me the justice to admit that. You
were stern, harsh, offensive. You treated me as no man has ever
dared to treat meâ€”no living man, at any rate. I bore it all. Now it
is for me to dictate terms."

Campbell buried his face in his hands, and a shudder passed
through him.

"Yes, it is my turn to dictate terms, Alan. You know what they
are. The thing is quite simple. Come, don't work yourself into this
fever. The thing has to be done. Face it, and do it."

A groan broke from Campbell's lips and he shivered all over. The
ticking of the clock on the mantelpiece seemed to him to be
dividing time into separate atoms of agony, each of which was too
terrible to be borne. He felt as if an iron ring was being slowly
tightened round his forehead, as if the disgrace with which he was
threatened had already come upon him. The hand upon his shoulder
weighed like a hand of lead. It was intolerable. It seemed to crush
him.
