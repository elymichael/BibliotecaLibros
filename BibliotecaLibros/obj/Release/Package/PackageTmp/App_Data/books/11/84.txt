"You will some day, surely?"

"Never."

"Well, perhaps you are right. And now good-bye, Dorian. You have
been the one person in my life who has really influenced my art.
Whatever I have done that is good, I owe to you. Ah! you don't know
what it cost me to tell you all that I have told you."

"My dear Basil," said Dorian, "what have you told me? Simply
that you felt that you admired me too much. That is not even a
compliment."

"It was not intended as a compliment. It was a confession. Now
that I have made it, something seems to have gone out of me.
Perhaps one should never put one's worship into words."

"It was a very disappointing confession."

"Why, what did you expect, Dorian? You didn't see anything else
in the picture, did you? There was nothing else to see?"

"No; there was nothing else to see. Why do you ask? But you
mustn't talk about worship. It is foolish. You and I are friends,
Basil, and we must always remain so."

"You have got Harry," said the painter sadly.

"Oh, Harry!" cried the lad, with a ripple of laughter. "Harry
spends his days in saying what is incredible and his evenings in
doing what is improbable. Just the sort of life I would like to
lead. But still I don't think I would go to Harry if I were in
trouble. I would sooner go to you, Basil."

"You will sit to me again?"
