<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>3<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>At half-past twelve next day Lord Henry Wotton strolled from<br/>Curzon Street over to the Albany to call on his uncle, Lord Fermor,<br/>a genial if somewhat rough-mannered old bachelor, whom the outside<br/>world called selfish because it derived no particular benefit from<br/>him, but who was considered generous by Society as he fed the<br/>people who amused him. His father had been our ambassador at Madrid<br/>when Isabella was young and Prim unthought of, but had retired from<br/>the diplomatic service in a capricious moment of annoyance on not<br/>being offered the Embassy at Paris, a post to which he considered<br/>that he was fully entitled by reason of his birth, his indolence,<br/>the good English of his dispatches, and his inordinate passion for<br/>pleasure. The son, who had been his father's secretary, had<br/>resigned along with his chief, somewhat foolishly as was thought at<br/>the time, and on succeeding some months later to the title, had set<br/>himself to the serious study of the great aristocratic art of doing<br/>absolutely nothing. He had two large town houses, but preferred to<br/>live in chambers as it was less trouble, and took most of his meals<br/>at his club. He paid some attention to the management of his<br/>collieries in the Midland counties, excusing himself for this taint<br/>of industry on the ground that the one advantage of having coal was<br/>that it enabled a gentleman to afford the decency of burning wood<br/>on his own hearth. In politics he was a Tory, except when the<br/>Tories were in office, during which period he roundly abused them<br/>for being a pack of Radicals. He was a hero to his valet, who<br/>bullied him, and a terror to most of his relations, whom he bullied<br/>in turn. Only England could have produced him, and he always said<br/>that the country was going to the dogs. His principles were out of<br/>date, but there was a good deal to be said for his prejudices.<br/><br/>When Lord Henry entered the room, he found his uncle sitting in<br/>a rough shooting-coat, smoking a cheroot and grumbling over The<br/>Times. "Well, Harry," said the old gentleman, "what brings you out<br/>so early? I thought you dandies never got up till two, and were not<br/>visible till five."<br/><br/>"Pure family affection, I assure you, Uncle George. I want to<br/>get something out of you."<br/><br/>"Money, I suppose," said Lord Fermor, making a wry face. "Well,<br/>sit down and tell me all about it. Young people, nowadays, imagine<br/>that money is everything."<br/><br/>"Yes," murmured Lord Henry, settling his button-hole in his<br/>coat; "and when they grow older they know it. But I don't want<br/>money. It is only people who pay their bills who want that, Uncle<br/>George, and I never pay mine. Credit is the capital of a younger<br/>son, and one lives charmingly upon it. Besides, I always deal with<br/>Dartmoor's tradesmen, and consequently they never bother me. What I<br/>want is information: not useful information, of course; useless<br/>information."<br/><br/>"Well, I can tell you anything that is in an English Blue Book,<br/>Harry, although those fellows nowadays write a lot of nonsense.<br/>When I was in the Diplomatic, things were much better. But I hear<br/>they let them in now by examination. What can you expect?<br/>Examinations, sir, are pure humbug from beginning to end. If a man<br/>is a gentleman, he knows quite enough, and if he is not a<br/>gentleman, whatever he knows is bad for him."<br/><br/>
