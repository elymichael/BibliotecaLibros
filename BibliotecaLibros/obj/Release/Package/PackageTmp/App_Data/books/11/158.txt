"Why?" said the younger man wearily.

"Because," said Lord Henry, passing beneath his nostrils the
gilt trellis of an open vinaigrette box, "one can survive
everything nowadays except that. Death and vulgarity are the only
two facts in the nineteenth century that one cannot explain away.
Let us have our coffee in the music-room, Dorian. You must play
Chopin to me. The man with whom my wife ran away played Chopin
exquisitely. Poor Victoria! I was very fond of her. The house is
rather lonely without her. Of course, married life is merely a
habit, a bad habit. But then one regrets the loss even of one's
worst habits. Perhaps one regrets them the most. They are such an
essential part of one's personality."

Dorian said nothing, but rose from the table, and passing into
the next room, sat down to the piano and let his fingers stray
across the white and black ivory of the keys. After the coffee had
been brought in, he stopped, and looking over at Lord Henry, said,
"Harry, did it ever occur to you that Basil was murdered?"

Lord Henry yawned. "Basil was very popular, and always wore a
Waterbury watch. Why should he have been murdered? He was not
clever enough to have enemies. Of course, he had a wonderful genius
for painting. But a man can paint like Velasquez and yet be as dull
as possible. Basil was really rather dull. He only interested me
once, and that was when he told me, years ago, that he had a wild
adoration for you and that you were the dominant motive of his
art."

"I was very fond of Basil," said Dorian with a note of sadness
in his voice. "But don't people say that he was murdered?"

"Oh, some of the papers do. It does not seem to me to be at all
probable. I know there are dreadful places in Paris, but Basil was
not the sort of man to have gone to them. He had no curiosity. It
was his chief defect."

"What would you say, Harry, if I told you that I had murdered
Basil?" said the younger man. He watched him intently after he had
spoken.

"I would say, my dear fellow, that you were posing for a
character that doesn't suit you. All crime is vulgar, just as all
vulgarity is crime. It is not in you, Dorian, to commit a murder. I
am sorry if I hurt your vanity by saying so, but I assure you it is
true. Crime belongs exclusively to the lower orders. I don't blame
them in the smallest degree. I should fancy that crime was to them
what art is to us, simply a method of procuring extraordinary
sensations."

"A method of procuring sensations? Do you think, then, that a
man who has once committed a murder could possibly do the same
crime again? Don't tell me that."

"Oh! anything becomes a pleasure if one does it too often,"
cried Lord Henry, laughing. "That is one of the most important
secrets of life. I should fancy, however, that murder is always a
mistake. One should never do anything that one cannot talk about
after dinner. But let us pass from poor Basil. I wish I could
believe that he had come to such a really romantic end as you
suggest, but I can't. I dare say he fell into the Seine off an
omnibus and that the conductor hushed up the scandal. Yes: I should
fancy that was his end. I see him lying now on his back under those
dull-green waters, with the heavy barges floating over him and long
weeds catching in his hair. Do you know, I don't think he would
have done much more good work. During the last ten years his
painting had gone off very much."
