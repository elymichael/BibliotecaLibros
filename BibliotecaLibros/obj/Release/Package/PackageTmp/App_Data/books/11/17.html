<br/>The lad started and drew back. He was bareheaded, and the leaves<br/>had tossed his rebellious curls and tangled all their gilded<br/>threads. There was a look of fear in his eyes, such as people have<br/>when they are suddenly awakened. His finely chiselled nostrils<br/>quivered, and some hidden nerve shook the scarlet of his lips and<br/>left them trembling.<br/><br/>"Yes," continued Lord Henry, "that is one of the great secrets<br/>of life— to cure the soul by means of the senses, and the senses by<br/>means of the soul. You are a wonderful creation. You know more than<br/>you think you know, just as you know less than you want to<br/>know."<br/><br/>Dorian Gray frowned and turned his head away. He could not help<br/>liking the tall, graceful young man who was standing by him. His<br/>romantic, olive-coloured face and worn expression interested him.<br/>There was something in his low languid voice that was absolutely<br/>fascinating. His cool, white, flowerlike hands, even, had a curious<br/>charm. They moved, as he spoke, like music, and seemed to have a<br/>language of their own. But he felt afraid of him, and ashamed of<br/>being afraid. Why had it been left for a stranger to reveal him to<br/>himself? He had known Basil Hallward for months, but the friendship<br/>between them had never altered him. Suddenly there had come some<br/>one across his life who seemed to have disclosed to him life's<br/>mystery. And, yet, what was there to be afraid of? He was not a<br/>schoolboy or a girl. It was absurd to be frightened.<br/><br/>"Let us go and sit in the shade," said Lord Henry. "Parker has<br/>brought out the drinks, and if you stay any longer in this glare,<br/>you will be quite spoiled, and Basil will never paint you again.<br/>You really must not allow yourself to become sunburnt. It would be<br/>unbecoming."<br/><br/>"What can it matter?" cried Dorian Gray, laughing, as he sat<br/>down on the seat at the end of the garden.<br/><br/>"It should matter everything to you, Mr. Gray."<br/><br/>"Why?"<br/><br/>"Because you have the most marvellous youth, and youth is the<br/>one thing worth having."<br/><br/>"I don't feel that, Lord Henry."<br/><br/>"No, you don't feel it now. Some day, when you are old and<br/>wrinkled and ugly, when thought has seared your forehead with its<br/>lines, and passion branded your lips with its hideous fires, you<br/>will feel it, you will feel it terribly. Now, wherever you go, you<br/>charm the world. Will it always be so?&#160;… You have a<br/>wonderfully beautiful face, Mr. Gray. Don't frown. You have. And<br/>beauty is a form of genius— is higher, indeed, than genius, as it<br/>needs no explanation. It is of the great facts of the world, like<br/>sunlight, or spring-time, or the reflection in dark waters of that<br/>silver shell we call the moon. It cannot be questioned. It has its<br/>divine right of sovereignty. It makes princes of those who have it.<br/>You smile? Ah! when you have lost it you won't smile… . People say<br/>sometimes that beauty is only superficial. That may be so, but at<br/>least it is not so superficial as thought is. To me, beauty is the<br/>wonder of wonders. It is only shallow people who do not judge by<br/>appearances. The true mystery of the world is the visible, not the<br/>invisible… . Yes, Mr. Gray, the gods have been good to you. But<br/>what the gods give they quickly take away. You have only a few<br/>years in which to live really, perfectly, and fully. When your<br/>youth goes, your beauty will go with it, and then you will suddenly<br/>discover that there are no triumphs left for you, or have to<br/>content yourself with those mean triumphs that the memory of your<br/>past will make more bitter than defeats. Every month as it wanes<br/>brings you nearer to something dreadful. Time is jealous of you,<br/>and wars against your lilies and your roses. You will become<br/>sallow, and hollow-cheeked, and dull-eyed. You will suffer<br/>horribly… . Ah! realize your youth while you have it. Don't<br/>squander the gold of your days, listening to the tedious, trying to<br/>improve the hopeless failure, or giving away your life to the<br/>ignorant, the common, and the vulgar. These are the sickly aims,<br/>the false ideals, of our age. Live! Live the wonderful life that is<br/>in you! Let nothing be lost upon you. Be always searching for new<br/>sensations. Be afraid of nothing… . A new Hedonism— that is what<br/>our century wants. You might be its visible symbol. With your<br/>personality there is nothing you could not do. The world belongs to<br/>you for a season… . The moment I met you I saw that you were quite<br/>unconscious of what you really are, of what you really might be.<br/>There was so much in you that charmed me that I felt I must tell<br/>you something about yourself. I thought how tragic it would be if<br/>you were wasted. For there is such a little time that your youth<br/>will last—such a little time. The common hill-flowers wither, but<br/>they blossom again. The laburnum will be as yellow next June as it<br/>is now. In a month there will be purple stars on the clematis, and<br/>year after year the green night of its leaves will hold its purple<br/>stars. But we never get back our youth. The pulse of joy that beats<br/>in us at twenty becomes sluggish. Our limbs fail, our senses rot.<br/>We degenerate into hideous puppets, haunted by the memory of the<br/>passions of which we were too much afraid, and the exquisite<br/>temptations that we had not the courage to yield to. Youth! Youth!<br/>There is absolutely nothing in the world but youth!"<br/><br/>
