<br/>"For the most trivial things, Mr. Gray, I assure you. Usually<br/>because I come in at ten minutes to nine and tell her that I must<br/>be dressed by half-past eight."<br/><br/>"How unreasonable of her! You should give her warning."<br/><br/>"I daren't, Mr. Gray. Why, she invents hats for me. You remember<br/>the one I wore at Lady Hilstone's garden-party? You don't, but it<br/>is nice of you to pretend that you do. Well, she made if out of<br/>nothing. All good hats are made out of nothing."<br/><br/>"Like all good reputations, Gladys," interrupted Lord Henry.<br/>"Every effect that one produces gives one an enemy. To be popular<br/>one must be a mediocrity."<br/><br/>"Not with women," said the duchess, shaking her head; "and women<br/>rule the world. I assure you we can't bear mediocrities. We women,<br/>as some one says, love with our ears, just as you men love with<br/>your eyes, if you ever love at all."<br/><br/>"It seems to me that we never do anything else," murmured<br/>Dorian.<br/><br/>"Ah! then, you never really love, Mr. Gray," answered the<br/>duchess with mock sadness.<br/><br/>"My dear Gladys!" cried Lord Henry. "How can you say that?<br/>Romance lives by repetition, and repetition converts an appetite<br/>into an art. Besides, each time that one loves is the only time one<br/>has ever loved. Difference of object does not alter singleness of<br/>passion. It merely intensifies it. We can have in life but one<br/>great experience at best, and the secret of life is to reproduce<br/>that experience as often as possible."<br/><br/>"Even when one has been wounded by it, Harry?" asked the duchess<br/>after a pause.<br/><br/>"Especially when one has been wounded by it," answered Lord<br/>Henry.<br/><br/>
