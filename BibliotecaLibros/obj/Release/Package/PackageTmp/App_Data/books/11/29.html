<br/>"They don't last, I am told," muttered his uncle.<br/><br/>"A long engagement exhausts them, but they are capital at a<br/>steeplechase. They take things flying. I don't think Dartmoor has a<br/>chance."<br/><br/>"Who are her people?" grumbled the old gentleman. "Has she got<br/>any?"<br/><br/>Lord Henry shook his head. "American girls are as clever at<br/>concealing their parents, as English women are at concealing their<br/>past," he said, rising to go.<br/><br/>"They are pork-packers, I suppose?"<br/><br/>"I hope so, Uncle George, for Dartmoor's sake. I am told that<br/>pork-packing is the most lucrative profession in America, after<br/>politics."<br/><br/>"Is she pretty?"<br/><br/>"She behaves as if she was beautiful. Most American women do. It<br/>is the secret of their charm."<br/><br/>"Why can't these American women stay in their own country? They<br/>are always telling us that it is the paradise for women."<br/><br/>"It is. That is the reason why, like Eve, they are so<br/>excessively anxious to get out of it," said Lord Henry. "Good-bye,<br/>Uncle George. I shall be late for lunch, if I stop any longer.<br/>Thanks for giving me the information I wanted. I always like to<br/>know everything about my new friends, and nothing about my old<br/>ones."<br/><br/>
