<br/>"She will never come to life again now," muttered the lad,<br/>burying his face in his hands.<br/><br/>"No, she will never come to life. She has played her last part.<br/>But you must think of that lonely death in the tawdry dressing-room<br/>simply as a strange lurid fragment from some Jacobean tragedy, as a<br/>wonderful scene from Webster, or Ford, or Cyril Tourneur. The girl<br/>never really lived, and so she has never really died. To you at<br/>least she was always a dream, a phantom that flitted through<br/>Shakespeare's plays and left them lovelier for its presence, a reed<br/>through which Shakespeare's music sounded richer and more full of<br/>joy. The moment she touched actual life, she marred it, and it<br/>marred her, and so she passed away. Mourn for Ophelia, if you like.<br/>Put ashes on your head because Cordelia was strangled. Cry out<br/>against Heaven because the daughter of Brabantio died. But don't<br/>waste your tears over Sibyl Vane. She was less real than they<br/>are."<br/><br/>There was a silence. The evening darkened in the room.<br/>Noiselessly, and with silver feet, the shadows crept in from the<br/>garden. The colours faded wearily out of things.<br/><br/>After some time Dorian Gray looked up. "You have explained me to<br/>myself, Harry," he murmured with something of a sigh of relief. "I<br/>felt all that you have said, but somehow I was afraid of it, and I<br/>could not express it to myself. How well you know me! But we will<br/>not talk again of what has happened. It has been a marvellous<br/>experience. That is all. I wonder if life has still in store for me<br/>anything as marvellous."<br/><br/>"Life has everything in store for you, Dorian. There is nothing<br/>that you, with your extraordinary good looks, will not be able to<br/>do."<br/><br/>"But suppose, Harry, I became haggard, and old, and wrinkled?<br/>What then?"<br/><br/>"Ah, then," said Lord Henry, rising to go, "then, my dear<br/>Dorian, you would have to fight for your victories. As it is, they<br/>are brought to you. No, you must keep your good looks. We live in<br/>an age that reads too much to be wise, and that thinks too much to<br/>be beautiful. We cannot spare you. And now you had better dress and<br/>drive down to the club. We are rather late, as it is."<br/><br/>"I think I shall join you at the opera, Harry. I feel too tired<br/>to eat anything. What is the number of your sister's box?"<br/><br/>"Twenty-seven, I believe. It is on the grand tier. You will see<br/>her name on the door. But I am sorry you won't come and dine."<br/><br/>"I don't feel up to it," said Dorian listlessly. "But I am<br/>awfully obliged to you for all that you have said to me. You are<br/>certainly my best friend. No one has ever understood me as you<br/>have."<br/><br/>
