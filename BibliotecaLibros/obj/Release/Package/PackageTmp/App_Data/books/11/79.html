<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>9<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>As he was sitting at breakfast next morning, Basil Hallward was<br/>shown into the room.<br/><br/>"I am so glad I have found you, Dorian," he said gravely. "I<br/>called last night, and they told me you were at the opera. Of<br/>course, I knew that was impossible. But I wish you had left word<br/>where you had really gone to. I passed a dreadful evening, half<br/>afraid that one tragedy might be followed by another. I think you<br/>might have telegraphed for me when you heard of it first. I read of<br/>it quite by chance in a late edition of The Globe that I picked up<br/>at the club. I came here at once and was miserable at not finding<br/>you. I can't tell you how heart-broken I am about the whole thing.<br/>I know what you must suffer. But where were you? Did you go down<br/>and see the girl's mother? For a moment I thought of following you<br/>there. They gave the address in the paper. Somewhere in the Euston<br/>Road, isn't it? But I was afraid of intruding upon a sorrow that I<br/>could not lighten. Poor woman! What a state she must be in! And her<br/>only child, too! What did she say about it all?"<br/><br/>"My dear Basil, how do I know?" murmured Dorian Gray, sipping<br/>some pale-yellow wine from a delicate, gold-beaded bubble of<br/>Venetian glass and looking dreadfully bored. "I was at the opera.<br/>You should have come on there. I met Lady Gwendolen, Harry's<br/>sister, for the first time. We were in her box. She is perfectly<br/>charming; and Patti sang divinely. Don't talk about horrid<br/>subjects. If one doesn't talk about a thing, it has never happened.<br/>It is simply expression, as Harry says, that gives reality to<br/>things. I may mention that she was not the woman's only child.<br/>There is a son, a charming fellow, I believe. But he is not on the<br/>stage. He is a sailor, or something. And now, tell me about<br/>yourself and what you are painting."<br/><br/>"You went to the opera?" said Hallward, speaking very slowly and<br/>with a strained touch of pain in his voice. "You went to the opera<br/>while Sibyl Vane was lying dead in some sordid lodging? You can<br/>talk to me of other women being charming, and of Patti singing<br/>divinely, before the girl you loved has even the quiet of a grave<br/>to sleep in? Why, man, there are horrors in store for that little<br/>white body of hers!"<br/><br/>"Stop, Basil! I won't hear it!" cried Dorian, leaping to his<br/>feet. "You must not tell me about things. What is done is done.<br/>What is past is past."<br/><br/>"You call yesterday the past?"<br/><br/>
