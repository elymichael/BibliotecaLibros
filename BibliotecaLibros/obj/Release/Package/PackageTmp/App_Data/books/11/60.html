<br/>"But do you approve of it, Harry?" asked the painter, walking up<br/>and down the room and biting his lip. "You can't approve of it,<br/>possibly. It is some silly infatuation."<br/><br/>"I never approve, or disapprove, of anything now. It is an<br/>absurd attitude to take towards life. We are not sent into the<br/>world to air our moral prejudices. I never take any notice of what<br/>common people say, and I never interfere with what charming people<br/>do. If a personality fascinates me, whatever mode of expression<br/>that personality selects is absolutely delightful to me. Dorian<br/>Gray falls in love with a beautiful girl who acts Juliet, and<br/>proposes to marry her. Why not? If he wedded Messalina, he would be<br/>none the less interesting. You know I am not a champion of<br/>marriage. The real drawback to marriage is that it makes one<br/>unselfish. And unselfish people are colourless. They lack<br/>individuality. Still, there are certain temperaments that marriage<br/>makes more complex. They retain their egotism, and add to it many<br/>other egos. They are forced to have more than one life. They become<br/>more highly organized, and to be highly organized is, I should<br/>fancy, the object of man's existence. Besides, every experience is<br/>of value, and whatever one may say against marriage, it is<br/>certainly an experience. I hope that Dorian Gray will make this<br/>girl his wife, passionately adore her for six months, and then<br/>suddenly become fascinated by some one else. He would be a<br/>wonderful study."<br/><br/>"You don't mean a single word of all that, Harry; you know you<br/>don't. If Dorian Gray's life were spoiled, no one would be sorrier<br/>than yourself. You are much better than you pretend to be."<br/><br/>Lord Henry laughed. "The reason we all like to think so well of<br/>others is that we are all afraid for ourselves. The basis of<br/>optimism is sheer terror. We think that we are generous because we<br/>credit our neighbour with the possession of those virtues that are<br/>likely to be a benefit to us. We praise the banker that we may<br/>overdraw our account, and find good qualities in the highwayman in<br/>the hope that he may spare our pockets. I mean everything that I<br/>have said. I have the greatest contempt for optimism. As for a<br/>spoiled life, no life is spoiled but one whose growth is arrested.<br/>If you want to mar a nature, you have merely to reform it. As for<br/>marriage, of course that would be silly, but there are other and<br/>more interesting bonds between men and women. I will certainly<br/>encourage them. They have the charm of being fashionable. But here<br/>is Dorian himself. He will tell you more than I can."<br/><br/>"My dear Harry, my dear Basil, you must both congratulate me!"<br/>said the lad, throwing off his evening cape with its satin-lined<br/>wings and shaking each of his friends by the hand in turn. "I have<br/>never been so happy. Of course, it is sudden— all really delightful<br/>things are. And yet it seems to me to be the one thing I have been<br/>looking for all my life." He was flushed with excitement and<br/>pleasure, and looked extraordinarily handsome.<br/><br/>"I hope you will always be very happy, Dorian," said Hallward,<br/>"but I don't quite forgive you for not having let me know of your<br/>engagement. You let Harry know."<br/><br/>"And I don't forgive you for being late for dinner," broke in<br/>Lord Henry, putting his hand on the lad's shoulder and smiling as<br/>he spoke. "Come, let us sit down and try what the new chef here is<br/>like, and then you will tell us how it all came about."<br/><br/>"There is really not much to tell," cried Dorian as they took<br/>their seats at the small round table. "What happened was simply<br/>this. After I left you yesterday evening, Harry, I dressed, had<br/>some dinner at that little Italian restaurant in Rupert Street you<br/>introduced me to, and went down at eight o'clock to the theatre.<br/>Sibyl was playing Rosalind. Of course, the scenery was dreadful and<br/>the Orlando absurd. But Sibyl! You should have seen her! When she<br/>came on in her boy's clothes, she was perfectly wonderful. She wore<br/>a moss-coloured velvet jerkin with cinnamon sleeves, slim, brown,<br/>cross-gartered hose, a dainty little green cap with a hawk's<br/>feather caught in a jewel, and a hooded cloak lined with dull red.<br/>She had never seemed to me more exquisite. She had all the delicate<br/>grace of that Tanagra figurine that you have in your studio, Basil.<br/>Her hair clustered round her face like dark leaves round a pale<br/>rose. As for her acting—well, you shall see her to-night. She is<br/>simply a born artist. I sat in the dingy box absolutely enthralled.<br/>I forgot that I was in London and in the nineteenth century. I was<br/>away with my love in a forest that no man had ever seen. After the<br/>performance was over, I went behind and spoke to her. As we were<br/>sitting together, suddenly there came into her eyes a look that I<br/>had never seen there before. My lips moved towards hers. We kissed<br/>each other. I can't describe to you what I felt at that moment. It<br/>seemed to me that all my life had been narrowed to one perfect<br/>point of rose-coloured joy. She trembled all over and shook like a<br/>white narcissus. Then she flung herself on her knees and kissed my<br/>hands. I feel that I should not tell you all this, but I can't help<br/>it. Of course, our engagement is a dead secret. She has not even<br/>told her own mother. I don't know what my guardians will say. Lord<br/>Radley is sure to be furious. I don't care. I shall be of age in<br/>less than a year, and then I can do what I like. I have been right,<br/>Basil, haven't I, to take my love out of poetry and to find my wife<br/>in Shakespeare's plays? Lips that Shakespeare taught to speak have<br/>whispered their secret in my ear. I have had the arms of Rosalind<br/>around me, and kissed Juliet on the mouth."<br/><br/>"Yes, Dorian, I suppose you were right," said Hallward<br/>slowly.<br/><br/>"Have you seen her to-day?" asked Lord Henry.<br/><br/>
