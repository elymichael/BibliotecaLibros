Yet he was afraid. Sometimes when he was down at his great house<br/>in Nottinghamshire, entertaining the fashionable young men of his<br/>own rank who were his chief companions, and astounding the county<br/>by the wanton luxury and gorgeous splendour of his mode of life, he<br/>would suddenly leave his guests and rush back to town to see that<br/>the door had not been tampered with and that the picture was still<br/>there. What if it should be stolen? The mere thought made him cold<br/>with horror. Surely the world would know his secret then. Perhaps<br/>the world already suspected it.<br/><br/>For, while he fascinated many, there were not a few who<br/>distrusted him. He was very nearly blackballed at a West End club<br/>of which his birth and social position fully entitled him to become<br/>a member, and it was said that on one occasion, when he was brought<br/>by a friend into the smoking-room of the Churchill, the Duke of<br/>Berwick and another gentleman got up in a marked manner and went<br/>out. Curious stories became current about him after he had passed<br/>his twenty-fifth year. It was rumoured that he had been seen<br/>brawling with foreign sailors in a low den in the distant parts of<br/>Whitechapel, and that he consorted with thieves and coiners and<br/>knew the mysteries of their trade. His extraordinary absences<br/>became notorious, and, when he used to reappear again in society,<br/>men would whisper to each other in corners, or pass him with a<br/>sneer, or look at him with cold searching eyes, as though they were<br/>determined to discover his secret.<br/><br/>Of such insolences and attempted slights he, of course, took no<br/>notice, and in the opinion of most people his frank debonair<br/>manner, his charming boyish smile, and the infinite grace of that<br/>wonderful youth that seemed never to leave him, were in themselves<br/>a sufficient answer to the calumnies, for so they termed them, that<br/>were circulated about him. It was remarked, however, that some of<br/>those who had been most intimate with him appeared, after a time,<br/>to shun him. Women who had wildly adored him, and for his sake had<br/>braved all social censure and set convention at defiance, were seen<br/>to grow pallid with shame or horror if Dorian Gray entered the<br/>room.<br/><br/>Yet these whispered scandals only increased in the eyes of many<br/>his strange and dangerous charm. His great wealth was a certain<br/>element of security. Society—civilized society, at least— is never<br/>very ready to believe anything to the detriment of those who are<br/>both rich and fascinating. It feels instinctively that manners are<br/>of more importance than morals, and, in its opinion, the highest<br/>respectability is of much less value than the possession of a good<br/>chef. And, after all, it is a very poor consolation to be told that<br/>the man who has given one a bad dinner, or poor wine, is<br/>irreproachable in his private life. Even the cardinal virtues<br/>cannot atone for half-cold entrees, as Lord Henry remarked once, in<br/>a discussion on the subject, and there is possibly a good deal to<br/>be said for his view. For the canons of good society are, or should<br/>be, the same as the canons of art. Form is absolutely essential to<br/>it. It should have the dignity of a ceremony, as well as its<br/>unreality, and should combine the insincere character of a romantic<br/>play with the wit and beauty that make such plays delightful to us.<br/>Is insincerity such a terrible thing? I think not. It is merely a<br/>method by which we can multiply our personalities.<br/><br/>Such, at any rate, was Dorian Gray's opinion. He used to wonder<br/>at the shallow psychology of those who conceive the ego in man as a<br/>thing simple, permanent, reliable, and of one essence. To him, man<br/>was a being with myriad lives and myriad sensations, a complex<br/>multiform creature that bore within itself strange legacies of<br/>thought and passion, and whose very flesh was tainted with the<br/>monstrous maladies of the dead. He loved to stroll through the<br/>gaunt cold picture-gallery of his country house and look at the<br/>various portraits of those whose blood flowed in his veins. Here<br/>was Philip Herbert, described by Francis Osborne, in his Memoires<br/>on the Reigns of Queen Elizabeth and King James, as one who was<br/>"caressed by the Court for his handsome face, which kept him not<br/>long company." Was it young Herbert's life that he sometimes led?<br/>Had some strange poisonous germ crept from body to body till it had<br/>reached his own? Was it some dim sense of that ruined grace that<br/>had made him so suddenly, and almost without cause, give utterance,<br/>in Basil Hallward's studio, to the mad prayer that had so changed<br/>his life? Here, in gold-embroidered red doublet, jewelled surcoat,<br/>and gilt-edged ruff and wristbands, stood Sir Anthony Sherard, with<br/>his silver-and-black armour piled at his feet. What had this man's<br/>legacy been? Had the lover of Giovanna of Naples bequeathed him<br/>some inheritance of sin and shame? Were his own actions merely the<br/>dreams that the dead man had not dared to realize? Here, from the<br/>fading canvas, smiled Lady Elizabeth Devereux, in her gauze hood,<br/>pearl stomacher, and pink slashed sleeves. A flower was in her<br/>right hand, and her left clasped an enamelled collar of white and<br/>damask roses. On a table by her side lay a mandolin and an apple.<br/>There were large green rosettes upon her little pointed shoes. He<br/>knew her life, and the strange stories that were told about her<br/>lovers. Had he something of her temperament in him? These oval,<br/>heavy-lidded eyes seemed to look curiously at him. What of George<br/>Willoughby, with his powdered hair and fantastic patches? How evil<br/>he looked! The face was saturnine and swarthy, and the sensual lips<br/>seemed to be twisted with disdain. Delicate lace ruffles fell over<br/>the lean yellow hands that were so overladen with rings. He had<br/>been a macaroni of the eighteenth century, and the friend, in his<br/>youth, of Lord Ferrars. What of the second Lord Beckenham, the<br/>companion of the Prince Regent in his wildest days, and one of the<br/>witnesses at the secret marriage with Mrs. Fitzherbert? How proud<br/>and handsome he was, with his chestnut curls and insolent pose!<br/>What passions had he bequeathed? The world had looked upon him as<br/>infamous. He had led the orgies at Carlton House. The star of the<br/>Garter glittered upon his breast. Beside him hung the portrait of<br/>his wife, a pallid, thin-lipped woman in black. Her blood, also,<br/>stirred within him. How curious it all seemed! And his mother with<br/>her Lady Hamilton face and her moist, wine-dashed lips—he knew what<br/>he had got from her. He had got from her his beauty, and his<br/>passion for the beauty of others. She laughed at him in her loose<br/>Bacchante dress. There were vine leaves in her hair. The purple<br/>spilled from the cup she was holding. The carnations of the<br/>painting had withered, but the eyes were still wonderful in their<br/>depth and brilliancy of colour. They seemed to follow him wherever<br/>he went.<br/><br/>Yet one had ancestors in literature as well as in one's own<br/>race, nearer perhaps in type and temperament, many of them, and<br/>certainly with an influence of which one was more absolutely<br/>conscious. There were times when it appeared to Dorian Gray that<br/>the whole of history was merely the record of his own life, not as<br/>he had lived it in act and circumstance, but as his imagination had<br/>created it for him, as it had been in his brain and in his<br/>passions. He felt that he had known them all, those strange<br/>terrible figures that had passed across the stage of the world and<br/>made sin so marvellous and evil so full of subtlety. It seemed to<br/>him that in some mysterious way their lives had been his own.<br/><br/>The hero of the wonderful novel that had so influenced his life<br/>had himself known this curious fancy. In the seventh chapter he<br/>tells how, crowned with laurel, lest lightning might strike him, he<br/>had sat, as Tiberius, in a garden at Capri, reading the shameful<br/>books of Elephantis, while dwarfs and peacocks strutted round him<br/>and the flute-player mocked the swinger of the censer; and, as<br/>Caligula, had caroused with the green-shirted jockeys in their<br/>stables and supped in an ivory manger with a jewel-frontleted<br/>horse; and, as Domitian, had wandered through a corridor lined with<br/>marble mirrors, looking round with haggard eyes for the reflection<br/>of the dagger that was to end his days, and sick with that ennui,<br/>that terrible taedium vitae, that comes on those to whom life<br/>denies nothing; and had peered through a clear emerald at the red<br/>shambles of the circus and then, in a litter of pearl and purple<br/>drawn by silver-shod mules, been carried through the Street of<br/>Pomegranates to a House of Gold and heard men cry on Nero Caesar as<br/>he passed by; and, as Elagabalus, had painted his face with<br/>colours, and plied the distaff among the women, and brought the<br/>Moon from Carthage and given her in mystic marriage to the Sun.<br/><br/>Over and over again Dorian used to read this fantastic chapter,<br/>and the two chapters immediately following, in which, as in some<br/>curious tapestries or cunningly wrought enamels, were pictured the<br/>awful and beautiful forms of those whom vice and blood and<br/>weariness had made monstrous or mad: Filippo, Duke of Milan, who<br/>slew his wife and painted her lips with a scarlet poison that her<br/>lover might suck death from the dead thing he fondled; Pietro<br/>Barbi, the Venetian, known as Paul the Second, who sought in his<br/>vanity to assume the title of Formosus, and whose tiara, valued at<br/>two hundred thousand florins, was bought at the price of a terrible<br/>sin; Gian Maria Visconti, who used hounds to chase living men and<br/>whose murdered body was covered with roses by a harlot who had<br/>loved him; the Borgia on his white horse, with Fratricide riding<br/>beside him and his mantle stained with the blood of Perotto; Pietro<br/>Riario, the young Cardinal Archbishop of Florence, child and minion<br/>of Sixtus IV, whose beauty was equalled only by his debauchery, and<br/>who received Leonora of Aragon in a pavilion of white and crimson<br/>silk, filled with nymphs and centaurs, and gilded a boy that he<br/>might serve at the feast as Ganymede or Hylas; Ezzelin, whose<br/>melancholy could be cured only by the spectacle of death, and who<br/>had a passion for red blood, as other men have for red wine—the son<br/>of the Fiend, as was reported, and one who had cheated his father<br/>at dice when gambling with him for his own soul; Giambattista Cibo,<br/>who in mockery took the name of Innocent and into whose torpid<br/>veins the blood of three lads was infused by a Jewish doctor;<br/>Sigismondo Malatesta, the lover of Isotta and the lord of Rimini,<br/>whose effigy was burned at Rome as the enemy of God and man, who<br/>strangled Polyssena with a napkin, and gave poison to Ginevra<br/>d'Este in a cup of emerald, and in honour of a shameful passion<br/>built a pagan church for Christian worship; Charles VI, who had so<br/>wildly adored his brother's wife that a leper had warned him of the<br/>insanity that was coming on him, and who, when his brain had<br/>sickened and grown strange, could only be soothed by Saracen cards<br/>painted with the images of love and death and madness; and, in his<br/>trimmed jerkin and jewelled cap and acanthuslike curls, Grifonetto<br/>Baglioni, who slew Astorre with his bride, and Simonetto with his<br/>page, and whose comeliness was such that, as he lay dying in the<br/>yellow piazza of Perugia, those who had hated him could not choose<br/>but weep, and Atalanta, who had cursed him, blessed him.<br/><br/>There was a horrible fascination in them all. He saw them at<br/>night, and they troubled his imagination in the day. The<br/>Renaissance knew of strange manners of poisoning— poisoning by a<br/>helmet and a lighted torch, by an embroidered glove and a jewelled<br/>fan, by a gilded pomander and by an amber chain. Dorian Gray had<br/>been poisoned by a book. There were moments when he looked on evil<br/>simply as a mode through which he could realize his conception of<br/>the beautiful.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
