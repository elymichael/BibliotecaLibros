"You will some day, surely?"<br/><br/>"Never."<br/><br/>"Well, perhaps you are right. And now good-bye, Dorian. You have<br/>been the one person in my life who has really influenced my art.<br/>Whatever I have done that is good, I owe to you. Ah! you don't know<br/>what it cost me to tell you all that I have told you."<br/><br/>"My dear Basil," said Dorian, "what have you told me? Simply<br/>that you felt that you admired me too much. That is not even a<br/>compliment."<br/><br/>"It was not intended as a compliment. It was a confession. Now<br/>that I have made it, something seems to have gone out of me.<br/>Perhaps one should never put one's worship into words."<br/><br/>"It was a very disappointing confession."<br/><br/>"Why, what did you expect, Dorian? You didn't see anything else<br/>in the picture, did you? There was nothing else to see?"<br/><br/>"No; there was nothing else to see. Why do you ask? But you<br/>mustn't talk about worship. It is foolish. You and I are friends,<br/>Basil, and we must always remain so."<br/><br/>"You have got Harry," said the painter sadly.<br/><br/>"Oh, Harry!" cried the lad, with a ripple of laughter. "Harry<br/>spends his days in saying what is incredible and his evenings in<br/>doing what is improbable. Just the sort of life I would like to<br/>lead. But still I don't think I would go to Harry if I were in<br/>trouble. I would sooner go to you, Basil."<br/><br/>"You will sit to me again?"<br/>
