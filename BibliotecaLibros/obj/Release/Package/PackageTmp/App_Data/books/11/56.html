<br/>"Not as long as you love him, I suppose," was the sullen<br/>answer.<br/><br/>"I shall love him for ever!" she cried.<br/><br/>"And he?"<br/><br/>"For ever, too!"<br/><br/>"He had better."<br/><br/>She shrank from him. Then she laughed and put her hand on his<br/>arm. He was merely a boy.<br/><br/>At the Marble Arch they hailed an omnibus, which left them close<br/>to their shabby home in the Euston Road. It was after five o'clock,<br/>and Sibyl had to lie down for a couple of hours before acting. Jim<br/>insisted that she should do so. He said that he would sooner part<br/>with her when their mother was not present. She would be sure to<br/>make a scene, and he detested scenes of every kind.<br/><br/>In Sybil's own room they parted. There was jealousy in the lad's<br/>heart, and a fierce murderous hatred of the stranger who, as it<br/>seemed to him, had come between them. Yet, when her arms were flung<br/>round his neck, and her fingers strayed through his hair, he<br/>softened and kissed her with real affection. There were tears in<br/>his eyes as he went downstairs.<br/><br/>His mother was waiting for him below. She grumbled at his<br/>unpunctuality, as he entered. He made no answer, but sat down to<br/>his meagre meal. The flies buzzed round the table and crawled over<br/>the stained cloth. Through the rumble of omnibuses, and the clatter<br/>of street-cabs, he could hear the droning voice devouring each<br/>minute that was left to him.<br/><br/>After some time, he thrust away his plate and put his head in<br/>his hands. He felt that he had a right to know. It should have been<br/>told to him before, if it was as he suspected. Leaden with fear,<br/>his mother watched him. Words dropped mechanically from her lips. A<br/>tattered lace handkerchief twitched in her fingers. When the clock<br/>struck six, he got up and went to the door. Then he turned back and<br/>looked at her. Their eyes met. In hers he saw a wild appeal for<br/>mercy. It enraged him.<br/><br/>
