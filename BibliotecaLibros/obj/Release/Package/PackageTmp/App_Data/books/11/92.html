<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>11<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>For years, Dorian Gray could not free himself from the influence<br/>of this book. Or perhaps it would be more accurate to say that he<br/>never sought to free himself from it. He procured from Paris no<br/>less than nine large-paper copies of the first edition, and had<br/>them bound in different colours, so that they might suit his<br/>various moods and the changing fancies of a nature over which he<br/>seemed, at times, to have almost entirely lost control. The hero,<br/>the wonderful young Parisian in whom the romantic and the<br/>scientific temperaments were so strangely blended, became to him a<br/>kind of prefiguring type of himself. And, indeed, the whole book<br/>seemed to him to contain the story of his own life, written before<br/>he had lived it.<br/><br/>In one point he was more fortunate than the novel's fantastic<br/>hero. He never knew—never, indeed, had any cause to know—that<br/>somewhat grotesque dread of mirrors, and polished metal surfaces,<br/>and still water which came upon the young Parisian so early in his<br/>life, and was occasioned by the sudden decay of a beau that had<br/>once, apparently, been so remarkable. It was with an almost cruel<br/>joy— and perhaps in nearly every joy, as certainly in every<br/>pleasure, cruelty has its place—that he used to read the latter<br/>part of the book, with its really tragic, if somewhat<br/>overemphasized, account of the sorrow and despair of one who had<br/>himself lost what in others, and the world, he had most dearly<br/>valued.<br/><br/>For the wonderful beauty that had so fascinated Basil Hallward,<br/>and many others besides him, seemed never to leave him. Even those<br/>who had heard the most evil things against him— and from time to<br/>time strange rumours about his mode of life crept through London<br/>and became the chatter of the clubs— could not believe anything to<br/>his dishonour when they saw him. He had always the look of one who<br/>had kept himself unspotted from the world. Men who talked grossly<br/>became silent when Dorian Gray entered the room. There was<br/>something in the purity of his face that rebuked them. His mere<br/>presence seemed to recall to them the memory of the innocence that<br/>they had tarnished. They wondered how one so charming and graceful<br/>as he was could have escaped the stain of an age that was at once<br/>sordid and sensual.<br/><br/>Often, on returning home from one of those mysterious and<br/>prolonged absences that gave rise to such strange conjecture among<br/>those who were his friends, or thought that they were so, he<br/>himself would creep upstairs to the locked room, open the door with<br/>the key that never left him now, and stand, with a mirror, in front<br/>of the portrait that Basil Hallward had painted of him, looking now<br/>at the evil and aging face on the canvas, and now at the fair young<br/>face that laughed back at him from the polished glass. The very<br/>sharpness of the contrast used to quicken his sense of pleasure. He<br/>grew more and more enamoured of his own beauty, more and more<br/>interested in the corruption of his own soul. He would examine with<br/>minute care, and sometimes with a monstrous and terrible delight,<br/>the hideous lines that seared the wrinkling forehead or crawled<br/>around the heavy sensual mouth, wondering sometimes which were the<br/>more horrible, the signs of sin or the signs of age. He would place<br/>his white hands beside the coarse bloated hands of the picture, and<br/>smile. He mocked the misshapen body and the failing limbs.<br/><br/>There were moments, indeed, at night, when, lying sleepless in<br/>his own delicately scented chamber, or in the sordid room of the<br/>little ill-famed tavern near the docks which, under an assumed name<br/>and in disguise, it was his habit to frequent, he would think of<br/>the ruin he had brought upon his soul with a pity that was all the<br/>more poignant because it was purely selfish. But moments such as<br/>these were rare. That curiosity about life which Lord Henry had<br/>first stirred in him, as they sat together in the garden of their<br/>friend, seemed to increase with gratification. The more he knew,<br/>the more he desired to know. He had mad hungers that grew more<br/>ravenous as he fed them.<br/><br/>Yet he was not really reckless, at any rate in his relations to<br/>society. Once or twice every month during the winter, and on each<br/>Wednesday evening while the season lasted, he would throw open to<br/>the world his beautiful house and have the most celebrated<br/>musicians of the day to charm his guests with the wonders of their<br/>art. His little dinners, in the settling of which Lord Henry always<br/>assisted him, were noted as much for the careful selection and<br/>placing of those invited, as for the exquisite taste shown in the<br/>decoration of the table, with its subtle symphonic arrangements of<br/>exotic flowers, and embroidered cloths, and antique plate of gold<br/>and silver. Indeed, there were many, especially among the very<br/>young men, who saw, or fancied that they saw, in Dorian Gray the<br/>true realization of a type of which they had often dreamed in Eton<br/>or Oxford days, a type that was to combine something of the real<br/>culture of the scholar with all the grace and distinction and<br/>perfect manner of a citizen of the world. To them he seemed to be<br/>of the company of those whom Dante describes as having sought to<br/>"make themselves perfect by the worship of beauty." Like Gautier,<br/>he was one for whom "the visible world existed."<br/><br/>
