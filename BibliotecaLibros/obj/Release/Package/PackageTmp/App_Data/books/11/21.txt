"This is your doing, Harry," said the painter bitterly.

Lord Henry shrugged his shoulders. "It is the real Dorian Grayâ€”
that is all."

"It is not."

"If it is not, what have I to do with it?"

"You should have gone away when I asked you," he muttered.

"I stayed when you asked me," was Lord Henry's answer.

"Harry, I can't quarrel with my two best friends at once, but
between you both you have made me hate the finest piece of work I
have ever done, and I will destroy it. What is it but canvas and
colour? I will not let it come across our three lives and mar
them."

Dorian Gray lifted his golden head from the pillow, and with
pallid face and tear-stained eyes, looked at him as he walked over
to the deal painting-table that was set beneath the high curtained
window. What was he doing there? His fingers were straying about
among the litter of tin tubes and dry brushes, seeking for
something. Yes, it was for the long palette-knife, with its thin
blade of lithe steel. He had found it at last. He was going to rip
up the canvas.

With a stifled sob the lad leaped from the couch, and, rushing
over to Hallward, tore the knife out of his hand, and flung it to
the end of the studio. "Don't, Basil, don't!" he cried. "It would
be murder!"

"I am glad you appreciate my work at last, Dorian," said the
painter coldly when he had recovered from his surprise. "I never
thought you would."
