<br/>The girl grew white, and trembled. She clenched her hands<br/>together, and her voice seemed to catch in her throat. "You are not<br/>serious, Dorian?" she murmured. "You are acting."<br/><br/>"Acting! I leave that to you. You do it so well," he answered<br/>bitterly.<br/><br/>She rose from her knees and, with a piteous expression of pain<br/>in her face, came across the room to him. She put her hand upon his<br/>arm and looked into his eyes. He thrust her back. "Don't touch me!"<br/>he cried.<br/><br/>A low moan broke from her, and she flung herself at his feet and<br/>lay there like a trampled flower. "Dorian, Dorian, don't leave me!"<br/>she whispered. "I am so sorry I didn't act well. I was thinking of<br/>you all the time. But I will try—indeed, I will try. It came so<br/>suddenly across me, my love for you. I think I should never have<br/>known it if you had not kissed me— if we had not kissed each other.<br/>Kiss me again, my love. Don't go away from me. I couldn't bear it.<br/>Oh! don't go away from me. My brother&#160;… No; never mind. He<br/>didn't mean it. He was in jest… . But you, oh! can't you forgive me<br/>for to-night? I will work so hard and try to improve. Don't be<br/>cruel to me, because I love you better than anything in the world.<br/>After all, it is only once that I have not pleased you. But you are<br/>quite right, Dorian. I should have shown myself more of an artist.<br/>It was foolish of me, and yet I couldn't help it. Oh, don't leave<br/>me, don't leave me." A fit of passionate sobbing choked her. She<br/>crouched on the floor like a wounded thing, and Dorian Gray, with<br/>his beautiful eyes, looked down at her, and his chiselled lips<br/>curled in exquisite disdain. There is always something ridiculous<br/>about the emotions of people whom one has ceased to love. Sibyl<br/>Vane seemed to him to be absurdly melodramatic. Her tears and sobs<br/>annoyed him.<br/><br/>"I am going," he said at last in his calm clear voice. "I don't<br/>wish to be unkind, but I can't see you again. You have disappointed<br/>me."<br/><br/>She wept silently, and made no answer, but crept nearer. Her<br/>little hands stretched blindly out, and appeared to be seeking for<br/>him. He turned on his heel and left the room. In a few moments he<br/>was out of the theatre.<br/><br/>Where he went to he hardly knew. He remembered wandering through<br/>dimly lit streets, past gaunt, black-shadowed archways and<br/>evil-looking houses. Women with hoarse voices and harsh laughter<br/>had called after him. Drunkards had reeled by, cursing and<br/>chattering to themselves like monstrous apes. He had seen grotesque<br/>children huddled upon door-steps, and heard shrieks and oaths from<br/>gloomy courts.<br/><br/>As the dawn was just breaking, he found himself close to Covent<br/>Garden. The darkness lifted, and, flushed with faint fires, the sky<br/>hollowed itself into a perfect pearl. Huge carts filled with<br/>nodding lilies rumbled slowly down the polished empty street. The<br/>air was heavy with the perfume of the flowers, and their beauty<br/>seemed to bring him an anodyne for his pain. He followed into the<br/>market and watched the men unloading their waggons. A white-smocked<br/>carter offered him some cherries. He thanked him, wondered why he<br/>refused to accept any money for them, and began to eat them<br/>listlessly. They had been plucked at midnight, and the coldness of<br/>the moon had entered into them. A long line of boys carrying crates<br/>of striped tulips, and of yellow and red roses, defiled in front of<br/>him, threading their way through the huge, jade-green piles of<br/>vegetables. Under the portico, with its grey, sun-bleached pillars,<br/>loitered a troop of draggled bareheaded girls, waiting for the<br/>auction to be over. Others crowded round the swinging doors of the<br/>coffee-house in the piazza. The heavy cart-horses slipped and<br/>stamped upon the rough stones, shaking their bells and trappings.<br/>Some of the drivers were lying asleep on a pile of sacks.<br/>Iris-necked and pink-footed, the pigeons ran about picking up<br/>seeds.<br/><br/>After a little while, he hailed a hansom and drove home. For a<br/>few moments he loitered upon the doorstep, looking round at the<br/>silent square, with its blank, close-shuttered windows and its<br/>staring blinds. The sky was pure opal now, and the roofs of the<br/>houses glistened like silver against it. From some chimney opposite<br/>a thin wreath of smoke was rising. It curled, a violet riband,<br/>through the nacre-coloured air.<br/><br/>In the huge gilt Venetian lantern, spoil of some Doge's barge,<br/>that hung from the ceiling of the great, oak-panelled hall of<br/>entrance, lights were still burning from three flickering jets:<br/>thin blue petals of flame they seemed, rimmed with white fire. He<br/>turned them out and, having thrown his hat and cape on the table,<br/>passed through the library towards the door of his bedroom, a large<br/>octagonal chamber on the ground floor that, in his new-born feeling<br/>for luxury, he had just had decorated for himself and hung with<br/>some curious Renaissance tapestries that had been discovered stored<br/>in a disused attic at Selby Royal. As he was turning the handle of<br/>the door, his eye fell upon the portrait Basil Hallward had painted<br/>of him. He started back as if in surprise. Then he went on into his<br/>own room, looking somewhat puzzled. After he had taken the<br/>button-hole out of his coat, he seemed to hesitate. Finally, he<br/>came back, went over to the picture, and examined it. In the dim<br/>arrested light that struggled through the cream-coloured silk<br/>blinds, the face appeared to him to be a little changed. The<br/>expression looked different. One would have said that there was a<br/>touch of cruelty in the mouth. It was certainly strange.<br/><br/>
