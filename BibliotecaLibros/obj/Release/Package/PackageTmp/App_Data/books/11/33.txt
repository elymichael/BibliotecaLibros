"Dear me!" said Lady Agatha, "how you men argue! I am sure I
never can make out what you are talking about. Oh! Harry, I am
quite vexed with you. Why do you try to persuade our nice Mr.
Dorian Gray to give up the East End? I assure you he would be quite
invaluable. They would love his playing."

"I want him to play to me," cried Lord Henry, smiling, and he
looked down the table and caught a bright answering glance.

"But they are so unhappy in Whitechapel," continued Lady
Agatha.

"I can sympathize with everything except suffering," said Lord
Henry, shrugging his shoulders. "I cannot sympathize with that. It
is too ugly, too horrible, too distressing. There is something
terribly morbid in the modern sympathy with pain. One should
sympathize with the colour, the beauty, the joy of life. The less
said about life's sores, the better."

"Still, the East End is a very important problem," remarked Sir
Thomas with a grave shake of the head.

"Quite so," answered the young lord. "It is the problem of
slavery, and we try to solve it by amusing the slaves."

The politician looked at him keenly. "What change do you
propose, then?" he asked.

Lord Henry laughed. "I don't desire to change anything in
England except the weather," he answered. "I am quite content with
philosophic contemplation. But, as the nineteenth century has gone
bankrupt through an over-expenditure of sympathy, I would suggest
that we should appeal to science to put us straight. The advantage
of the emotions is that they lead us astray, and the advantage of
science is that it is not emotional."

"But we have such grave responsibilities," ventured Mrs.
Vandeleur timidly.

"Terribly grave," echoed Lady Agatha.
