A new life! That was what he wanted. That was what he was<br/>waiting for. Surely he had begun it already. He had spared one<br/>innocent thing, at any rate. He would never again tempt innocence.<br/>He would be good.<br/><br/>As he thought of Hetty Merton, he began to wonder if the<br/>portrait in the locked room had changed. Surely it was not still so<br/>horrible as it had been? Perhaps if his life became pure, he would<br/>be able to expel every sign of evil passion from the face. Perhaps<br/>the signs of evil had already gone away. He would go and look.<br/><br/>He took the lamp from the table and crept upstairs. As he<br/>unbarred the door, a smile of joy flitted across his strangely<br/>young-looking face and lingered for a moment about his lips. Yes,<br/>he would be good, and the hideous thing that he had hidden away<br/>would no longer be a terror to him. He felt as if the load had been<br/>lifted from him already.<br/><br/>He went in quietly, locking the door behind him, as was his<br/>custom, and dragged the purple hanging from the portrait. A cry of<br/>pain and indignation broke from him. He could see no change, save<br/>that in the eyes there was a look of cunning and in the mouth the<br/>curved wrinkle of the hypocrite. The thing was still loathsome—more<br/>loathsome, if possible, than before—and the scarlet dew that<br/>spotted the hand seemed brighter, and more like blood newly<br/>spilled. Then he trembled. Had it been merely vanity that had made<br/>him do his one good deed? Or the desire for a new sensation, as<br/>Lord Henry had hinted, with his mocking laugh? Or that passion to<br/>act a part that sometimes makes us do things finer than we are<br/>ourselves? Or, perhaps, all these? And why was the red stain larger<br/>than it had been? It seemed to have crept like a horrible disease<br/>over the wrinkled fingers. There was blood on the painted feet, as<br/>though the thing had dripped—blood even on the hand that had not<br/>held the knife. Confess? Did it mean that he was to confess? To<br/>give himself up and be put to death? He laughed. He felt that the<br/>idea was monstrous. Besides, even if he did confess, who would<br/>believe him? There was no trace of the murdered man anywhere.<br/>Everything belonging to him had been destroyed. He himself had<br/>burned what had been below-stairs. The world would simply say that<br/>he was mad. They would shut him up if he persisted in his story… .<br/>Yet it was his duty to confess, to suffer public shame, and to make<br/>public atonement. There was a God who called upon men to tell their<br/>sins to earth as well as to heaven. Nothing that he could do would<br/>cleanse him till he had told his own sin. His sin? He shrugged his<br/>shoulders. The death of Basil Hallward seemed very little to him.<br/>He was thinking of Hetty Merton. For it was an unjust mirror, this<br/>mirror of his soul that he was looking at. Vanity? Curiosity?<br/>Hypocrisy? Had there been nothing more in his renunciation than<br/>that? There had been something more. At least he thought so. But<br/>who could tell?&#160;… No. There had been nothing more. Through<br/>vanity he had spared her. In hypocrisy he had worn the mask of<br/>goodness. For curiosity's sake he had tried the denial of self. He<br/>recognized that now.<br/><br/>But this murder—was it to dog him all his life? Was he always to<br/>be burdened by his past? Was he really to confess? Never. There was<br/>only one bit of evidence left against him. The picture itself— that<br/>was evidence. He would destroy it. Why had he kept it so long? Once<br/>it had given him pleasure to watch it changing and growing old. Of<br/>late he had felt no such pleasure. It had kept him awake at night.<br/>When he had been away, he had been filled with terror lest other<br/>eyes should look upon it. It had brought melancholy across his<br/>passions. Its mere memory had marred many moments of joy. It had<br/>been like conscience to him. Yes, it had been conscience. He would<br/>destroy it.<br/><br/>He looked round and saw the knife that had stabbed Basil<br/>Hallward. He had cleaned it many times, till there was no stain<br/>left upon it. It was bright, and glistened. As it had killed the<br/>painter, so it would kill the painter's work, and all that that<br/>meant. It would kill the past, and when that was dead, he would be<br/>free. It would kill this monstrous soul-life, and without its<br/>hideous warnings, he would be at peace. He seized the thing, and<br/>stabbed the picture with it.<br/><br/>There was a cry heard, and a crash. The cry was so horrible in<br/>its agony that the frightened servants woke and crept out of their<br/>rooms. Two gentlemen, who were passing in the square below, stopped<br/>and looked up at the great house. They walked on till they met a<br/>policeman and brought him back. The man rang the bell several<br/>times, but there was no answer. Except for a light in one of the<br/>top windows, the house was all dark. After a time, he went away and<br/>stood in an adjoining portico and watched.<br/><br/>"Whose house is that, Constable?" asked the elder of the two<br/>gentlemen.<br/><br/>"Mr. Dorian Gray's, sir," answered the policeman.<br/><br/>They looked at each other, as they walked away, and sneered. One<br/>of them was Sir Henry Ashton's uncle.<br/><br/>Inside, in the servants' part of the house, the half-clad<br/>domestics were talking in low whispers to each other. Old Mrs. Leaf<br/>was crying and wringing her hands. Francis was as pale as<br/>death.<br/>
