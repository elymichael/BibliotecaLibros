The painter felt strangely moved. The lad was infinitely dear to
him, and his personality had been the great turning point in his
art. He could not bear the idea of reproaching him any more. After
all, his indifference was probably merely a mood that would pass
away. There was so much in him that was good, so much in him that
was noble.

"Well, Dorian," he said at length, with a sad smile, "I won't
speak to you again about this horrible thing, after to-day. I only
trust your name won't be mentioned in connection with it. The
inquest is to take place this afternoon. Have they summoned
you?"

Dorian shook his head, and a look of annoyance passed over his
face at the mention of the word "inquest." There was something so
crude and vulgar about everything of the kind. "They don't know my
name," he answered.

"But surely she did?"

"Only my Christian name, and that I am quite sure she never
mentioned to any one. She told me once that they were all rather
curious to learn who I was, and that she invariably told them my
name was Prince Charming. It was pretty of her. You must do me a
drawing of Sibyl, Basil. I should like to have something more of
her than the memory of a few kisses and some broken pathetic
words."

"I will try and do something, Dorian, if it would please you.
But you must come and sit to me yourself again. I can't get on
without you."

"I can never sit to you again, Basil. It is impossible!" he
exclaimed, starting back.

The painter stared at him. "My dear boy, what nonsense!" he
cried. "Do you mean to say you don't like what I did of you? Where
is it? Why have you pulled the screen in front of it? Let me look
at it. It is the best thing I have ever done. Do take the screen
away, Dorian. It is simply disgraceful of your servant hiding my
work like that. I felt the room looked different as I came in."

"My servant has nothing to do with it, Basil. You don't imagine
I let him arrange my room for me? He settles my flowers for me
sometimesâ€” that is all. No; I did it myself. The light was too
strong on the portrait."

"Too strong! Surely not, my dear fellow? It is an admirable
place for it. Let me see it." And Hallward walked towards the
corner of the room.
