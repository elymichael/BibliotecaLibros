"Because I have loved so many of them, Dorian."<br/><br/>"Oh, yes, horrid people with dyed hair and painted faces."<br/><br/>"Don't run down dyed hair and painted faces. There is an<br/>extraordinary charm in them, sometimes," said Lord Henry.<br/><br/>"I wish now I had not told you about Sibyl Vane."<br/><br/>"You could not have helped telling me, Dorian. All through your<br/>life you will tell me everything you do."<br/><br/>"Yes, Harry, I believe that is true. I cannot help telling you<br/>things. You have a curious influence over me. If I ever did a<br/>crime, I would come and confess it to you. You would understand<br/>me."<br/><br/>"People like you—the wilful sunbeams of life—don't commit<br/>crimes, Dorian. But I am much obliged for the compliment, all the<br/>same. And now tell me— reach me the matches, like a good<br/>boy—thanks—what are your actual relations with Sibyl Vane?"<br/><br/>Dorian Gray leaped to his feet, with flushed cheeks and burning<br/>eyes. "Harry! Sibyl Vane is sacred!"<br/><br/>"It is only the sacred things that are worth touching, Dorian,"<br/>said Lord Henry, with a strange touch of pathos in his voice. "But<br/>why should you be annoyed? I suppose she will belong to you some<br/>day. When one is in love, one always begins by deceiving one's<br/>self, and one always ends by deceiving others. That is what the<br/>world calls a romance. You know her, at any rate, I suppose?"<br/><br/>"Of course I know her. On the first night I was at the theatre,<br/>the horrid old Jew came round to the box after the performance was<br/>over and offered to take me behind the scenes and introduce me to<br/>her. I was furious with him, and told him that Juliet had been dead<br/>for hundreds of years and that her body was lying in a marble tomb<br/>in Verona. I think, from his blank look of amazement, that he was<br/>under the impression that I had taken too much champagne, or<br/>something."<br/><br/>"I am not surprised."<br/>
