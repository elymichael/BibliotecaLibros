She started to her feet. "There he is!" she cried.

"Who?" said Jim Vane.

"Prince Charming," she answered, looking after the victoria.

He jumped up and seized her roughly by the arm. "Show him to me.
Which is he? Point him out. I must see him!" he exclaimed; but at
that moment the Duke of Berwick's four-in-hand came between, and
when it had left the space clear, the carriage had swept out of the
park.

"He is gone," murmured Sibyl sadly. "I wish you had seen
him."

"I wish I had, for as sure as there is a God in heaven, if he
ever does you any wrong, I shall kill him."

She looked at him in horror. He repeated his words. They cut the
air like a dagger. The people round began to gape. A lady standing
close to her tittered.

"Come away, Jim; come away," she whispered. He followed her
doggedly as she passed through the crowd. He felt glad at what he
had said.

When they reached the Achilles Statue, she turned round. There
was pity in her eyes that became laughter on her lips. She shook
her head at him. "You are foolish, Jim, utterly foolish; a
bad-tempered boy, that is all. How can you say such horrible
things? You don't know what you are talking about. You are simply
jealous and unkind. Ah! I wish you would fall in love. Love makes
people good, and what you said was wicked."

"I am sixteen," he answered, "and I know what I am about. Mother
is no help to you. She doesn't understand how to look after you. I
wish now that I was not going to Australia at all. I have a great
mind to chuck the whole thing up. I would, if my articles hadn't
been signed."

"Oh, don't be so serious, Jim. You are like one of the heroes of
those silly melodramas Mother used to be so fond of acting in. I am
not going to quarrel with you. I have seen him, and oh! to see him
is perfect happiness. We won't quarrel. I know you would never harm
any one I love, would you?"
