<br/>"I thought you had left England."<br/><br/>"Darlington is not going to do anything. My brother paid the<br/>bill at last. George doesn't speak to me eitherâ€¦ . I don't care,"<br/>he added with a sigh. "As long as one has this stuff, one doesn't<br/>want friends. I think I have had too many friends."<br/><br/>Dorian winced and looked round at the grotesque things that lay<br/>in such fantastic postures on the ragged mattresses. The twisted<br/>limbs, the gaping mouths, the staring lustreless eyes, fascinated<br/>him. He knew in what strange heavens they were suffering, and what<br/>dull hells were teaching them the secret of some new joy. They were<br/>better off than he was. He was prisoned in thought. Memory, like a<br/>horrible malady, was eating his soul away. From time to time he<br/>seemed to see the eyes of Basil Hallward looking at him. Yet he<br/>felt he could not stay. The presence of Adrian Singleton troubled<br/>him. He wanted to be where no one would know who he was. He wanted<br/>to escape from himself.<br/><br/>"I am going on to the other place," he said after a pause.<br/><br/>"On the wharf?"<br/><br/>"Yes."<br/><br/>"That mad-cat is sure to be there. They won't have her in this<br/>place now."<br/><br/>Dorian shrugged his shoulders. "I am sick of women who love one.<br/>Women who hate one are much more interesting. Besides, the stuff is<br/>better."<br/><br/>"Much the same."<br/><br/>"I like it better. Come and have something to drink. I must have<br/>something."<br/><br/>
