When he entered, she looked at him, and an expression of<br/>infinite joy came over her. "How badly I acted to-night, Dorian!"<br/>she cried.<br/><br/>"Horribly!" he answered, gazing at her in amazement. "Horribly!<br/>It was dreadful. Are you ill? You have no idea what it was. You<br/>have no idea what I suffered."<br/><br/>The girl smiled. "Dorian," she answered, lingering over his name<br/>with long-drawn music in her voice, as though it were sweeter than<br/>honey to the red petals of her mouth. "Dorian, you should have<br/>understood. But you understand now, don't you?"<br/><br/>"Understand what?" he asked, angrily.<br/><br/>"Why I was so bad to-night. Why I shall always be bad. Why I<br/>shall never act well again."<br/><br/>He shrugged his shoulders. "You are ill, I suppose. When you are<br/>ill you shouldn't act. You make yourself ridiculous. My friends<br/>were bored. I was bored."<br/><br/>She seemed not to listen to him. She was transfigured with joy.<br/>An ecstasy of happiness dominated her.<br/><br/>"Dorian, Dorian," she cried, "before I knew you, acting was the<br/>one reality of my life. It was only in the theatre that I lived. I<br/>thought that it was all true. I was Rosalind one night and Portia<br/>the other. The joy of Beatrice was my joy, and the sorrows of<br/>Cordelia were mine also. I believed in everything. The common<br/>people who acted with me seemed to me to be godlike. The painted<br/>scenes were my world. I knew nothing but shadows, and I thought<br/>them real. You came—oh, my beautiful love!— and you freed my soul<br/>from prison. You taught me what reality really is. To-night, for<br/>the first time in my life, I saw through the hollowness, the sham,<br/>the silliness of the empty pageant in which I had always played.<br/>To-night, for the first time, I became conscious that the Romeo was<br/>hideous, and old, and painted, that the moonlight in the orchard<br/>was false, that the scenery was vulgar, and that the words I had to<br/>speak were unreal, were not my words, were not what I wanted to<br/>say. You had brought me something higher, something of which all<br/>art is but a reflection. You had made me understand what love<br/>really is. My love! My love! Prince Charming! Prince of life! I<br/>have grown sick of shadows. You are more to me than all art can<br/>ever be. What have I to do with the puppets of a play? When I came<br/>on to-night, I could not understand how it was that everything had<br/>gone from me. I thought that I was going to be wonderful. I found<br/>that I could do nothing. Suddenly it dawned on my soul what it all<br/>meant. The knowledge was exquisite to me. I heard them hissing, and<br/>I smiled. What could they know of love such as ours? Take me away,<br/>Dorian—take me away with you, where we can be quite alone. I hate<br/>the stage. I might mimic a passion that I do not feel, but I cannot<br/>mimic one that burns me like fire. Oh, Dorian, Dorian, you<br/>understand now what it signifies? Even if I could do it, it would<br/>be profanation for me to play at being in love. You have made me<br/>see that."<br/><br/>He flung himself down on the sofa and turned away his face. "You<br/>have killed my love," he muttered.<br/><br/>She looked at him in wonder and laughed. He made no answer. She<br/>came across to him, and with her little fingers stroked his hair.<br/>She knelt down and pressed his hands to her lips. He drew them<br/>away, and a shudder ran through him.<br/><br/>Then he leaped up and went to the door. "Yes," he cried, "you<br/>have killed my love. You used to stir my imagination. Now you don't<br/>even stir my curiosity. You simply produce no effect. I loved you<br/>because you were marvellous, because you had genius and intellect,<br/>because you realized the dreams of great poets and gave shape and<br/>substance to the shadows of art. You have thrown it all away. You<br/>are shallow and stupid. My God! how mad I was to love you! What a<br/>fool I have been! You are nothing to me now. I will never see you<br/>again. I will never think of you. I will never mention your name.<br/>You don't know what you were to me, once. Why, once&#160;… Oh, I<br/>can't bear to think of it! I wish I had never laid eyes upon you!<br/>You have spoiled the romance of my life. How little you can know of<br/>love, if you say it mars your art! Without your art, you are<br/>nothing. I would have made you famous, splendid, magnificent. The<br/>world would have worshipped you, and you would have borne my name.<br/>What are you now? A third-rate actress with a pretty face."<br/>
