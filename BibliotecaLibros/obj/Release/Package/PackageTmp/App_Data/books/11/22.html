"Appreciate it? I am in love with it, Basil. It is part of<br/>myself. I feel that."<br/><br/>"Well, as soon as you are dry, you shall be varnished, and<br/>framed, and sent home. Then you can do what you like with<br/>yourself." And he walked across the room and rang the bell for tea.<br/>"You will have tea, of course, Dorian? And so will you, Harry? Or<br/>do you object to such simple pleasures?"<br/><br/>"I adore simple pleasures," said Lord Henry. "They are the last<br/>refuge of the complex. But I don't like scenes, except on the<br/>stage. What absurd fellows you are, both of you! I wonder who it<br/>was defined man as a rational animal. It was the most premature<br/>definition ever given. Man is many things, but he is not rational.<br/>I am glad he is not, after allâ€” though I wish you chaps would not<br/>squabble over the picture. You had much better let me have it,<br/>Basil. This silly boy doesn't really want it, and I really do."<br/><br/>"If you let any one have it but me, Basil, I shall never forgive<br/>you!" cried Dorian Gray; "and I don't allow people to call me a<br/>silly boy."<br/><br/>"You know the picture is yours, Dorian. I gave it to you before<br/>it existed."<br/><br/>"And you know you have been a little silly, Mr. Gray, and that<br/>you don't really object to being reminded that you are extremely<br/>young."<br/><br/>"I should have objected very strongly this morning, Lord<br/>Henry."<br/><br/>"Ah! this morning! You have lived since then."<br/><br/>There came a knock at the door, and the butler entered with a<br/>laden tea-tray and set it down upon a small Japanese table. There<br/>was a rattle of cups and saucers and the hissing of a fluted<br/>Georgian urn. Two globe-shaped china dishes were brought in by a<br/>page. Dorian Gray went over and poured out the tea. The two men<br/>sauntered languidly to the table and examined what was under the<br/>covers.<br/><br/>"Let us go to the theatre to-night," said Lord Henry. "There is<br/>sure to be something on, somewhere. I have promised to dine at<br/>White's, but it is only with an old friend, so I can send him a<br/>wire to say that I am ill, or that I am prevented from coming in<br/>consequence of a subsequent engagement. I think that would be a<br/>rather nice excuse: it would have all the surprise of candour."<br/><br/>"It is such a bore putting on one's dress-clothes," muttered<br/>Hallward. "And, when one has them on, they are so horrid."<br/>
