It was some consolation that Harry was to be there, and when the
door opened and he heard his slow musical voice lending charm to
some insincere apology, he ceased to feel bored.

But at dinner he could not eat anything. Plate after plate went
away untasted. Lady Narborough kept scolding him for what she
called "an insult to poor Adolphe, who invented the menu specially
for you," and now and then Lord Henry looked across at him,
wondering at his silence and abstracted manner. From time to time
the butler filled his glass with champagne. He drank eagerly, and
his thirst seemed to increase.

"Dorian," said Lord Henry at last, as the chaud-froid was being
handed round, "what is the matter with you to-night? You are quite
out of sorts."

"I believe he is in love," cried Lady Narborough, "and that he
is afraid to tell me for fear I should be jealous. He is quite
right. I certainly should."

"Dear Lady Narborough," murmured Dorian, smiling, "I have not
been in love for a whole weekâ€”not, in fact, since Madame de Ferrol
left town."

"How you men can fall in love with that woman!" exclaimed the
old lady. "I really cannot understand it."

"It is simply because she remembers you when you were a little
girl, Lady Narborough," said Lord Henry. "She is the one link
between us and your short frocks."

"She does not remember my short frocks at all, Lord Henry. But I
remember her very well at Vienna thirty years ago, and how
decolletee she was then."

"She is still decolletee," he answered, taking an olive in his
long fingers; "and when she is in a very smart gown she looks like
an edition de luxe of a bad French novel. She is really wonderful,
and full of surprises. Her capacity for family affection is
extraordinary. When her third husband died, her hair turned quite
gold from grief."

"How can you, Harry!" cried Dorian.

"It is a most romantic explanation," laughed the hostess. "But
her third husband, Lord Henry! You don't mean to say Ferrol is the
fourth?"
