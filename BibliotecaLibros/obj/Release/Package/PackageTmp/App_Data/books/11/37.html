<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>4<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>One afternoon, a month later, Dorian Gray was reclining in a<br/>luxurious arm-chair, in the little library of Lord Henry's house in<br/>Mayfair. It was, in its way, a very charming room, with its high<br/>panelled wainscoting of olive-stained oak, its cream-coloured<br/>frieze and ceiling of raised plasterwork, and its brickdust felt<br/>carpet strewn with silk, long-fringed Persian rugs. On a tiny<br/>satinwood table stood a statuette by Clodion, and beside it lay a<br/>copy of Les Cent Nouvelles, bound for Margaret of Valois by Clovis<br/>Eve and powdered with the gilt daisies that Queen had selected for<br/>her device. Some large blue china jars and parrot-tulips were<br/>ranged on the mantelshelf, and through the small leaded panes of<br/>the window streamed the apricot-coloured light of a summer day in<br/>London.<br/><br/>Lord Henry had not yet come in. He was always late on principle,<br/>his principle being that punctuality is the thief of time. So the<br/>lad was looking rather sulky, as with listless fingers he turned<br/>over the pages of an elaborately illustrated edition of Manon<br/>Lescaut that he had found in one of the book-cases. The formal<br/>monotonous ticking of the Louis Quatorze clock annoyed him. Once or<br/>twice he thought of going away.<br/><br/>At last he heard a step outside, and the door opened. "How late<br/>you are, Harry!" he murmured.<br/><br/>"I am afraid it is not Harry, Mr. Gray," answered a shrill<br/>voice.<br/><br/>He glanced quickly round and rose to his feet. "I beg your<br/>pardon. I thoughtâ€”"<br/><br/>"You thought it was my husband. It is only his wife. You must<br/>let me introduce myself. I know you quite well by your photographs.<br/>I think my husband has got seventeen of them."<br/><br/>
