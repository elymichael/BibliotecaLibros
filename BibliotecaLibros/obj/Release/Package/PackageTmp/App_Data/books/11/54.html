<br/>"He is a gentleman," said the lad sullenly.<br/><br/>"A prince!" she cried musically. "What more do you want?"<br/><br/>"He wants to enslave you."<br/><br/>"I shudder at the thought of being free."<br/><br/>"I want you to beware of him."<br/><br/>"To see him is to worship him; to know him is to trust him."<br/><br/>"Sibyl, you are mad about him."<br/><br/>She laughed and took his arm. "You dear old Jim, you talk as if<br/>you were a hundred. Some day you will be in love yourself. Then you<br/>will know what it is. Don't look so sulky. Surely you should be<br/>glad to think that, though you are going away, you leave me happier<br/>than I have ever been before. Life has been hard for us both,<br/>terribly hard and difficult. But it will be different now. You are<br/>going to a new world, and I have found one. Here are two chairs;<br/>let us sit down and see the smart people go by."<br/><br/>They took their seats amidst a crowd of watchers. The tulip-beds<br/>across the road flamed like throbbing rings of fire. A white dust—<br/>tremulous cloud of orris-root it seemed—hung in the panting air.<br/>The brightly coloured parasols danced and dipped like monstrous<br/>butterflies.<br/><br/>She made her brother talk of himself, his hopes, his prospects.<br/>He spoke slowly and with effort. They passed words to each other as<br/>players at a game pass counters. Sibyl felt oppressed. She could<br/>not communicate her joy. A faint smile curving that sullen mouth<br/>was all the echo she could win. After some time she became silent.<br/>Suddenly she caught a glimpse of golden hair and laughing lips, and<br/>in an open carriage with two ladies Dorian Gray drove past.<br/><br/>
