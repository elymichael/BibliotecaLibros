<br/>"How serious you both are!" she cried. "What is the matter?"<br/><br/>"Nothing," he answered. "I suppose one must be serious<br/>sometimes. Good-bye, Mother; I will have my dinner at five o'clock.<br/>Everything is packed, except my shirts, so you need not<br/>trouble."<br/><br/>"Good-bye, my son," she answered with a bow of strained<br/>stateliness.<br/><br/>She was extremely annoyed at the tone he had adopted with her,<br/>and there was something in his look that had made her feel<br/>afraid.<br/><br/>"Kiss me, Mother," said the girl. Her flowerlike lips touched<br/>the withered cheek and warmed its frost.<br/><br/>"My child! my child!" cried Mrs. Vane, looking up to the ceiling<br/>in search of an imaginary gallery.<br/><br/>"Come, Sibyl," said her brother impatiently. He hated his<br/>mother's affectations.<br/><br/>They went out into the flickering, wind-blown sunlight and<br/>strolled down the dreary Euston Road. The passersby glanced in<br/>wonder at the sullen heavy youth who, in coarse, ill-fitting<br/>clothes, was in the company of such a graceful, refined-looking<br/>girl. He was like a common gardener walking with a rose.<br/><br/>Jim frowned from time to time when he caught the inquisitive<br/>glance of some stranger. He had that dislike of being stared at,<br/>which comes on geniuses late in life and never leaves the<br/>commonplace. Sibyl, however, was quite unconscious of the effect<br/>she was producing. Her love was trembling in laughter on her lips.<br/>She was thinking of Prince Charming, and, that she might think of<br/>him all the more, she did not talk of him, but prattled on about<br/>the ship in which Jim was going to sail, about the gold he was<br/>certain to find, about the wonderful heiress whose life he was to<br/>save from the wicked, red-shirted bushrangers. For he was not to<br/>remain a sailor, or a supercargo, or whatever he was going to be.<br/>Oh, no! A sailor's existence was dreadful. Fancy being cooped up in<br/>a horrid ship, with the hoarse, hump-backed waves trying to get in,<br/>and a black wind blowing the masts down and tearing the sails into<br/>long screaming ribands! He was to leave the vessel at Melbourne,<br/>bid a polite good-bye to the captain, and go off at once to the<br/>gold-fields. Before a week was over he was to come across a large<br/>nugget of pure gold, the largest nugget that had ever been<br/>discovered, and bring it down to the coast in a waggon guarded by<br/>six mounted policemen. The bushrangers were to attack them three<br/>times, and be defeated with immense slaughter. Or, no. He was not<br/>to go to the gold-fields at all. They were horrid places, where men<br/>got intoxicated, and shot each other in bar-rooms, and used bad<br/>language. He was to be a nice sheep-farmer, and one evening, as he<br/>was riding home, he was to see the beautiful heiress being carried<br/>off by a robber on a black horse, and give chase, and rescue her.<br/>Of course, she would fall in love with him, and he with her, and<br/>they would get married, and come home, and live in an immense house<br/>in London. Yes, there were delightful things in store for him. But<br/>he must be very good, and not lose his temper, or spend his money<br/>foolishly. She was only a year older than he was, but she knew so<br/>much more of life. He must be sure, also, to write to her by every<br/>mail, and to say his prayers each night before he went to sleep.<br/>God was very good, and would watch over him. She would pray for<br/>him, too, and in a few years he would come back quite rich and<br/>happy.<br/><br/>The lad listened sulkily to her and made no answer. He was<br/>heart-sick at leaving home.<br/><br/>
