A quarter of an hour afterwards, amidst an extraordinary turmoil<br/>of applause, Sibyl Vane stepped on to the stage. Yes, she was<br/>certainly lovely to look at— one of the loveliest creatures, Lord<br/>Henry thought, that he had ever seen. There was something of the<br/>fawn in her shy grace and startled eyes. A faint blush, like the<br/>shadow of a rose in a mirror of silver, came to her cheeks as she<br/>glanced at the crowded enthusiastic house. She stepped back a few<br/>paces and her lips seemed to tremble. Basil Hallward leaped to his<br/>feet and began to applaud. Motionless, and as one in a dream, sat<br/>Dorian Gray, gazing at her. Lord Henry peered through his glasses,<br/>murmuring, "Charming! charming!"<br/><br/>The scene was the hall of Capulet's house, and Romeo in his<br/>pilgrim's dress had entered with Mercutio and his other friends.<br/>The band, such as it was, struck up a few bars of music, and the<br/>dance began. Through the crowd of ungainly, shabbily dressed<br/>actors, Sibyl Vane moved like a creature from a finer world. Her<br/>body swayed, while she danced, as a plant sways in the water. The<br/>curves of her throat were the curves of a white lily. Her hands<br/>seemed to be made of cool ivory.<br/><br/>Yet she was curiously listless. She showed no sign of joy when<br/>her eyes rested on Romeo. The few words she had to speak—<br/><br/>Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much, Which mannerly<br/>devotion shows in this; For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands<br/>do touch, And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss— with the brief<br/>dialogue that follows, were spoken in a thoroughly artificial<br/>manner. The voice was exquisite, but from the point of view of tone<br/>it was absolutely false. It was wrong in colour. It took away all<br/>the life from the verse. It made the passion unreal.<br/><br/>Dorian Gray grew pale as he watched her. He was puzzled and<br/>anxious. Neither of his friends dared to say anything to him. She<br/>seemed to them to be absolutely incompetent. They were horribly<br/>disappointed.<br/><br/>Yet they felt that the true test of any Juliet is the balcony<br/>scene of the second act. They waited for that. If she failed there,<br/>there was nothing in her.<br/><br/>She looked charming as she came out in the moonlight. That could<br/>not be denied. But the staginess of her acting was unbearable, and<br/>grew worse as she went on. Her gestures became absurdly artificial.<br/>She overemphasized everything that she had to say. The beautiful<br/>passage—<br/><br/>Thou knowest the mask of night is on my face, Else would a<br/>maiden blush bepaint my cheek For that which thou hast heard me<br/>speak to-night—<br/><br/>was declaimed with the painful precision of a schoolgirl who has<br/>been taught to recite by some second-rate professor of elocution.<br/>When she leaned over the balcony and came to those wonderful<br/>lines—<br/><br/>Although I joy in thee, I have no joy of this contract to-night:<br/>It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden; Too like the lightning,<br/>which doth cease to be Ere one can say, "It lightens." Sweet,<br/>good-night! This bud of love by summer's ripening breath May prove<br/>a beauteous flower when next we meet— she spoke the words as though<br/>they conveyed no meaning to her. It was not nervousness. Indeed, so<br/>far from being nervous, she was absolutely self-contained. It was<br/>simply bad art. She was a complete failure.<br/><br/>Even the common uneducated audience of the pit and gallery lost<br/>their interest in the play. They got restless, and began to talk<br/>loudly and to whistle. The Jew manager, who was standing at the<br/>back of the dress-circle, stamped and swore with rage. The only<br/>person unmoved was the girl herself.<br/>
