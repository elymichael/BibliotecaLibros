"To some little actress or other."

"I can't believe it. Dorian is far too sensible."

"Dorian is far too wise not to do foolish things now and then,
my dear Basil."

"Marriage is hardly a thing that one can do now and then,
Harry."

"Except in America," rejoined Lord Henry languidly. "But I
didn't say he was married. I said he was engaged to be married.
There is a great difference. I have a distinct remembrance of being
married, but I have no recollection at all of being engaged. I am
inclined to think that I never was engaged."

"But think of Dorian's birth, and position, and wealth. It would
be absurd for him to marry so much beneath him."

"If you want to make him marry this girl, tell him that, Basil.
He is sure to do it, then. Whenever a man does a thoroughly stupid
thing, it is always from the noblest motives."

"I hope the girl is good, Harry. I don't want to see Dorian tied
to some vile creature, who might degrade his nature and ruin his
intellect."

"Oh, she is better than goodâ€”she is beautiful," murmured Lord
Henry, sipping a glass of vermouth and orange-bitters. "Dorian says
she is beautiful, and he is not often wrong about things of that
kind. Your portrait of him has quickened his appreciation of the
personal appearance of other people. It has had that excellent
effect, amongst others. We are to see her to-night, if that boy
doesn't forget his appointment."

"Are you serious?"

"Quite serious, Basil. I should be miserable if I thought I
should ever be more serious than I am at the present moment."
