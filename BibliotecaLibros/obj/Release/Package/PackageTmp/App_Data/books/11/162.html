<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>20<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>It was a lovely night, so warm that he threw his coat over his<br/>arm and did not even put his silk scarf round his throat. As he<br/>strolled home, smoking his cigarette, two young men in evening<br/>dress passed him. He heard one of them whisper to the other, "That<br/>is Dorian Gray." He remembered how pleased he used to be when he<br/>was pointed out, or stared at, or talked about. He was tired of<br/>hearing his own name now. Half the charm of the little village<br/>where he had been so often lately was that no one knew who he was.<br/>He had often told the girl whom he had lured to love him that he<br/>was poor, and she had believed him. He had told her once that he<br/>was wicked, and she had laughed at him and answered that wicked<br/>people were always very old and very ugly. What a laugh she<br/>had!—just like a thrush singing. And how pretty she had been in her<br/>cotton dresses and her large hats! She knew nothing, but she had<br/>everything that he had lost.<br/><br/>When he reached home, he found his servant waiting up for him.<br/>He sent him to bed, and threw himself down on the sofa in the<br/>library, and began to think over some of the things that Lord Henry<br/>had said to him.<br/><br/>Was it really true that one could never change? He felt a wild<br/>longing for the unstained purity of his boyhood— his rose-white<br/>boyhood, as Lord Henry had once called it. He knew that he had<br/>tarnished himself, filled his mind with corruption and given horror<br/>to his fancy; that he had been an evil influence to others, and had<br/>experienced a terrible joy in being so; and that of the lives that<br/>had crossed his own, it had been the fairest and the most full of<br/>promise that he had brought to shame. But was it all irretrievable?<br/>Was there no hope for him?<br/><br/>Ah! in what a monstrous moment of pride and passion he had<br/>prayed that the portrait should bear the burden of his days, and he<br/>keep the unsullied splendour of eternal youth! All his failure had<br/>been due to that. Better for him that each sin of his life had<br/>brought its sure swift penalty along with it. There was<br/>purification in punishment. Not "Forgive us our sins" but "Smite us<br/>for our iniquities" should be the prayer of man to a most just<br/>God.<br/><br/>The curiously carved mirror that Lord Henry had given to him, so<br/>many years ago now, was standing on the table, and the white-limbed<br/>Cupids laughed round it as of old. He took it up, as he had done on<br/>that night of horror when be had first noted the change in the<br/>fatal picture, and with wild, tear-dimmed eyes looked into its<br/>polished shield. Once, some one who had terribly loved him had<br/>written to him a mad letter, ending with these idolatrous words:<br/>"The world is changed because you are made of ivory and gold. The<br/>curves of your lips rewrite history." The phrases came back to his<br/>memory, and he repeated them over and over to himself. Then he<br/>loathed his own beauty, and flinging the mirror on the floor,<br/>crushed it into silver splinters beneath his heel. It was his<br/>beauty that had ruined him, his beauty and the youth that he had<br/>prayed for. But for those two things, his life might have been free<br/>from stain. His beauty had been to him but a mask, his youth but a<br/>mockery. What was youth at best? A green, an unripe time, a time of<br/>shallow moods, and sickly thoughts. Why had he worn its livery?<br/>Youth had spoiled him.<br/><br/>It was better not to think of the past. Nothing could alter<br/>that. It was of himself, and of his own future, that he had to<br/>think. James Vane was hidden in a nameless grave in Selby<br/>churchyard. Alan Campbell had shot himself one night in his<br/>laboratory, but had not revealed the secret that he had been forced<br/>to know. The excitement, such as it was, over Basil Hallward's<br/>disappearance would soon pass away. It was already waning. He was<br/>perfectly safe there. Nor, indeed, was it the death of Basil<br/>Hallward that weighed most upon his mind. It was the living death<br/>of his own soul that troubled him. Basil had painted the portrait<br/>that had marred his life. He could not forgive him that. It was the<br/>portrait that had done everything. Basil had said things to him<br/>that were unbearable, and that he had yet borne with patience. The<br/>murder had been simply the madness of a moment. As for Alan<br/>Campbell, his suicide had been his own act. He had chosen to do it.<br/>It was nothing to him.<br/><br/>
