He walked up and down the room two or three times. Then he<br/>turned to the still figure in the chair. "Mother, are my things<br/>ready?" he asked.<br/><br/>"Quite ready, James," she answered, keeping her eyes on her<br/>work. For some months past she had felt ill at ease when she was<br/>alone with this rough stern son of hers. Her shallow secret nature<br/>was troubled when their eyes met. She used to wonder if he<br/>suspected anything. The silence, for he made no other observation,<br/>became intolerable to her. She began to complain. Women defend<br/>themselves by attacking, just as they attack by sudden and strange<br/>surrenders. "I hope you will be contented, James, with your<br/>sea-faring life," she said. "You must remember that it is your own<br/>choice. You might have entered a solicitor's office. Solicitors are<br/>a very respectable class, and in the country often dine with the<br/>best families."<br/><br/>"I hate offices, and I hate clerks," he replied. "But you are<br/>quite right. I have chosen my own life. All I say is, watch over<br/>Sibyl. Don't let her come to any harm. Mother, you must watch over<br/>her."<br/><br/>"James, you really talk very strangely. Of course I watch over<br/>Sibyl."<br/><br/>"I hear a gentleman comes every night to the theatre and goes<br/>behind to talk to her. Is that right? What about that?"<br/><br/>"You are speaking about things you don't understand, James. In<br/>the profession we are accustomed to receive a great deal of most<br/>gratifying attention. I myself used to receive many bouquets at one<br/>time. That was when acting was really understood. As for Sibyl, I<br/>do not know at present whether her attachment is serious or not.<br/>But there is no doubt that the young man in question is a perfect<br/>gentleman. He is always most polite to me. Besides, he has the<br/>appearance of being rich, and the flowers he sends are lovely."<br/><br/>"You don't know his name, though," said the lad harshly.<br/><br/>"No," answered his mother with a placid expression in her face.<br/>"He has not yet revealed his real name. I think it is quite<br/>romantic of him. He is probably a member of the aristocracy."<br/><br/>James Vane bit his lip. "Watch over Sibyl, Mother," he cried,<br/>"watch over her."<br/><br/>"My son, you distress me very much. Sibyl is always under my<br/>special care. Of course, if this gentleman is wealthy, there is no<br/>reason why she should not contract an alliance with him. I trust he<br/>is one of the aristocracy. He has all the appearance of it, I must<br/>say. It might be a most brilliant marriage for Sibyl. They would<br/>make a charming couple. His good looks are really quite remarkable;<br/>everybody notices them."<br/><br/>The lad muttered something to himself and drummed on the<br/>window-pane with his coarse fingers. He had just turned round to<br/>say something when the door opened and Sibyl ran in.<br/>
