<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>8<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>It was long past noon when he awoke. His valet had crept several<br/>times on tiptoe into the room to see if he was stirring, and had<br/>wondered what made his young master sleep so late. Finally his bell<br/>sounded, and Victor came in softly with a cup of tea, and a pile of<br/>letters, on a small tray of old Sevres china, and drew back the<br/>olive-satin curtains, with their shimmering blue lining, that hung<br/>in front of the three tall windows.<br/><br/>"Monsieur has well slept this morning," he said, smiling.<br/><br/>"What o'clock is it, Victor?" asked Dorian Gray drowsily.<br/><br/>"One hour and a quarter, Monsieur."<br/><br/>How late it was! He sat up, and having sipped some tea, turned<br/>over his letters. One of them was from Lord Henry, and had been<br/>brought by hand that morning. He hesitated for a moment, and then<br/>put it aside. The others he opened listlessly. They contained the<br/>usual collection of cards, invitations to dinner, tickets for<br/>private views, programmes of charity concerts, and the like that<br/>are showered on fashionable young men every morning during the<br/>season. There was a rather heavy bill for a chased silver<br/>Louis-Quinze toilet-set that he had not yet had the courage to send<br/>on to his guardians, who were extremely old-fashioned people and<br/>did not realize that we live in an age when unnecessary things are<br/>our only necessities; and there were several very courteously<br/>worded communications from Jermyn Street money-lenders offering to<br/>advance any sum of money at a moment's notice and at the most<br/>reasonable rates of interest.<br/><br/>After about ten minutes he got up, and throwing on an elaborate<br/>dressing-gown of silk-embroidered cashmere wool, passed into the<br/>onyx-paved bathroom. The cool water refreshed him after his long<br/>sleep. He seemed to have forgotten all that he had gone through. A<br/>dim sense of having taken part in some strange tragedy came to him<br/>once or twice, but there was the unreality of a dream about it.<br/><br/>
