<br/>"I'm very sorry to hear of this, Miss March," he said, in the<br/>kind, quiet tone which sounded very pleasantly to her perturbed<br/>spirit. "I came to offer myself as escort to your mother. Mr.<br/>Laurence has commissions for me in Washington, and it will give me<br/>real satisfaction to be of service to her there."<br/><br/>Down dropped the rubbers, and the tea was very near following,<br/>as Meg put out her hand, with a face so full of gratitude that Mr.<br/>Brooke would have felt repaid for a much greater sacrifice than the<br/>trifling one of time and comfort which he was about to take.<br/><br/>"How kind you all are! Mother will accept, I'm sure, and it will<br/>be such a relief to know that she has someone to take care of her.<br/>Thank you very, very much!"<br/><br/>Meg spoke earnestly, and forgot herself entirely till something<br/>in the brown eyes looking down at her made her remember the cooling<br/>tea, and lead the way into the parlor, saying she would call her<br/>mother.<br/><br/>Everything was arranged by the time Laurie returned with a note<br/>from Aunt March, enclosing the desired sum, and a few lines<br/>repeating what she had often said before, that she had always told<br/>them it was absurd for March to go into the army, always predicted<br/>that no good would come of it, and she hoped they would take her<br/>advice the next time. Mrs. March put the note in the fire, the<br/>money in her purse, and went on with her preparations, with her<br/>lips folded tightly in a way which Jo would have understood if she<br/>had been there.<br/><br/>The short afternoon wore away. All other errands were done, and<br/>Meg and her mother busy at some necessary needlework, while Beth<br/>and Amy got tea, and Hannah finished her ironing with what she<br/>called a 'slap and a bang', but still Jo did not come. They began<br/>to get anxious, and Laurie went off to find her, for no one knew<br/>what freak Jo might take into her head. He missed her, however, and<br/>she came walking in with a very queer expression of countenance,<br/>for there was a mixture of fun and fear, satisfaction and regret in<br/>it, which puzzled the family as much as did the roll of bills she<br/>laid before her mother, saying with a little choke in her voice,<br/>"That's my contribution toward making Father comfortable and<br/>bringing him home!"<br/><br/>"My dear, where did you get it? Twenty-five dollars! Jo, I hope<br/>you haven't done anything rash?"<br/><br/>"No, it's mine honestly. I didn't beg, borrow, or steal it. I<br/>earned it, and I don't think you'll blame me, for I only sold what<br/>was my own."<br/><br/>As she spoke, Jo took off her bonnet, and a general outcry<br/>arose, for all her abundant hair was cut short.<br/><br/>"Your hair! Your beautiful hair!" "Oh, Jo, how could you? Your<br/>one beauty." "My dear girl, there was no need of this." "She<br/>doesn't look like my Jo any more, but I love her dearly for<br/>it!"<br/><br/>
