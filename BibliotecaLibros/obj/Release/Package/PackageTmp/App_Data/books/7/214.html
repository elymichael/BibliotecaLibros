"Pooh! You're a girl, and it's fun, but I'll allow no man to<br/>shake me!"<br/><br/>"I don't think anyone would care to try it, if you looked as<br/>much like a thundercloud as you do now. Why were you treated<br/>so?"<br/><br/>"Just because I wouldn't say what your mother wanted me for. I'd<br/>promised not to tell, and of course I wasn't going to break my<br/>word."<br/><br/>"Couldn't you satisfy your grandpa in any other way?"<br/><br/>"No, he would have the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but<br/>the truth. I'd have told my part of the scrape, if I could without<br/>bringing Meg in. As I couldn't, I held my tongue, and bore the<br/>scolding till the old gentleman collared me. Then I bolted, for<br/>fear I should forget myself."<br/><br/>"It wasn't nice, but he's sorry, I know, so go down and make up.<br/>I'll help you."<br/><br/>"Hanged if I do! I'm not going to be lectured and pummelled by<br/>everyone, just for a bit of a frolic. I was sorry about Meg, and<br/>begged pardon like a man, but I won't do it again, when I wasn't in<br/>the wrong."<br/><br/>"He didn't know that."<br/><br/>"He ought to trust me, and not act as if I was a baby. It's no<br/>use, Jo, he's got to learn that I'm able to take care of myself,<br/>and don't need anyone's apron string to hold on by."<br/><br/>"What pepper pots you are!" sighed Jo. "How do you mean to<br/>settle this affair?"<br/><br/>"Well, he ought to beg pardon, and believe me when I say I can't<br/>tell him what the fuss's about."<br/>
