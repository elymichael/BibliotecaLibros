<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>13<br/>Bethâ€™s Secret<br/><br/><br/>When Jo came home that spring, she had been struck with the<br/>change in Beth. No one spoke of it or seemed aware of it, for it<br/>had come too gradually to startle those who saw her daily, but to<br/>eyes sharpened by absence, it was very plain and a heavy weight<br/>fell on Jo's heart as she saw her sister's face. It was no paler<br/>and but littler thinner than in the autumn, yet there was a<br/>strange, transparent look about it, as if the mortal was being<br/>slowly refined away, and the immortal shining through the frail<br/>flesh with an indescribably pathetic beauty. Jo saw and felt it,<br/>but said nothing at the time, and soon the first impression lost<br/>much of its power, for Beth seemed happy, no one appeared to doubt<br/>that she was better, and presently in other cares Jo for a time<br/>forgot her fear.<br/><br/>But when Laurie was gone, and peace prevailed again, the vague<br/>anxiety returned and haunted her. She had confessed her sins and<br/>been forgiven, but when she showed her savings and proposed a<br/>mountain trip, Beth had thanked her heartily, but begged not to go<br/>so far away from home. Another little visit to the seashore would<br/>suit her better, and as Grandma could not be prevailed upon to<br/>leave the babies, Jo took Beth down to the quiet place, where she<br/>could live much in the open air, and let the fresh sea breezes blow<br/>a little color into her pale cheeks.<br/><br/>It was not a fashionable place, but even among the pleasant<br/>people there, the girls made few friends, preferring to live for<br/>one another. Beth was too shy to enjoy society, and Jo too wrapped<br/>up in her to care for anyone else. So they were all in all to each<br/>other, and came and went, quite unconscious of the interest they<br/>exited in those about them, who watched with sympathetic eyes the<br/>strong sister and the feeble one, always together, as if they felt<br/>instinctively that a long separation was not far away.<br/><br/>They did feel it, yet neither spoke of it, for often between<br/>ourselves and those nearest and dearest to us there exists a<br/>reserve which it is very hard to overcome. Jo felt as if a veil had<br/>fallen between her heart and Beth's, but when she put out her hand<br/>to lift it up, there seemed something sacred in the silence, and<br/>she waited for Beth to speak. She wondered, and was thankful also,<br/>that her parents did not seem to see what she saw, and during the<br/>quiet weeks when the shadows grew so plain to her, she said nothing<br/>of it to those at home, believing that it would tell itself when<br/>Beth came back no better. She wondered still more if her sister<br/>really guessed the hard truth, and what thoughts were passing<br/>through her mind during the long hours when she lay on the warm<br/>rocks with her head in Jo's lap, while the winds blew healthfully<br/>over her and the sea made music at her feet.<br/><br/>One day Beth told her. Jo thought she was asleep, she lay so<br/>still, and putting down her book, sat looking at her with wistful<br/>eyes, trying to see signs of hope in the faint color on Beth's<br/>cheeks. But she could not find enough to satisfy her, for the<br/>cheeks were very thin, and the hands seemed too feeble to hold even<br/>the rosy little shells they had been collecting. It came to her<br/>then more bitterly than ever that Beth was slowly drifting away<br/>from her, and her arms instinctively tightened their hold upon the<br/>dearest treasure she possessed. For a minute her eyes were too dim<br/>for seeing, and when they cleared, Beth was looking up at her so<br/>tenderly that there was hardly any need for her to say, "Jo, dear,<br/>I'm glad you know it. I've tried to tell you, but I couldn't."<br/><br/>There was no answer except her sister's cheek against her own,<br/>not even tears, for when most deeply moved, Jo did not cry. She was<br/>the weaker then, and Beth tried to comfort and sustain her, with<br/>her arms about her and the soothing words she whispered in her<br/>ear.<br/><br/>"I've known it for a good while, dear, and now I'm used to it,<br/>it isn't hard to think of or to bear. Try to see it so and don't be<br/>troubled about me, because it's best, indeed it is."<br/>
