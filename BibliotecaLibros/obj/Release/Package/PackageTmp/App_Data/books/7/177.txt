The busy mind has no time to think
Of sorrow or care or gloom.
And anxious thoughts may be swept away,
As we bravely wield a broom.

I am glad a task to me is given,
To labor at day by day,
For it brings me health and strength and hope,
And I cheerfully learn to say,
"Head, you may think, Heart, you may feel,
But, Hand, you shall work alway!"

Dear Mother,

There is only room for me to send my love, and
some pressed pansies from the root I have been keeping safe in the
house for Father to see. I read every morning, try to be good all
day, and sing myself to sleep with Father's tune. I can't sing
'LAND OF THE LEAL' now, it makes me cry. Everyone is very kind, and
we are as happy as we can be without you. Amy wants the rest of the
page, so I must stop. I didn't forget to cover the holders, and I
wind the clock and air the rooms every day.

Kiss dear Father on the cheek he calls mine. Oh,
do come soon to your lovingâ€¦

LITTLE BETH
