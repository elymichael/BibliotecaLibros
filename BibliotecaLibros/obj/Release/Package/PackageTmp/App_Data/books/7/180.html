<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>17<br/>Little Faithful<br/><br/><br/>For a week the amount of virtue in the old house would have<br/>supplied the neighborhood. It was really amazing, for everyone<br/>seemed in a heavenly frame of mind, and self-denial was all the<br/>fashion. Relieved of their first anxiety about their father, the<br/>girls insensibly relaxed their praiseworthy efforts a little, and<br/>began to fall back into old ways. They did not forget their motto,<br/>but hoping and keeping busy seemed to grow easier, and after such<br/>tremendous exertions, they felt that Endeavor deserved a holiday,<br/>and gave it a good many.<br/><br/>Jo caught a bad cold through neglect to cover the shorn head<br/>enough, and was ordered to stay at home till she was better, for<br/>Aunt March didn't like to hear people read with colds in their<br/>heads. Jo liked this, and after an energetic rummage from garret to<br/>cellar, subsided on the sofa to nurse her cold with arsenicum and<br/>books. Amy found that housework and art did not go well together,<br/>and returned to her mud pies. Meg went daily to her pupils, and<br/>sewed, or thought she did, at home, but much time was spent in<br/>writing long letters to her mother, or reading the Washington<br/>dispatches over and over. Beth kept on, with only slight relapses<br/>into idleness or grieving.<br/><br/>All the little duties were faithfully done each day, and many of<br/>her sisters' also, for they were forgetful, and the house seemed<br/>like a clock whose pendulum was gone a-visiting. When her heart got<br/>heavy with longings for Mother or fears for Father, she went away<br/>into a certain closet, hid her face in the folds of a dear old<br/>gown, and made her little moan and prayed her little prayer quietly<br/>by herself. Nobody knew what cheered her up after a sober fit, but<br/>everyone felt how sweet and helpful Beth was, and fell into a way<br/>of going to her for comfort or advice in their small affairs.<br/><br/>All were unconscious that this experience was a test of<br/>character, and when the first excitement was over, felt that they<br/>had done well and deserved praise. So they did, but their mistake<br/>was in ceasing to do well, and they learned this lesson through<br/>much anxiety and regret.<br/><br/>"Meg, I wish you'd go and see the Hummels. You know Mother told<br/>us not to forget them." said Beth, ten days after Mrs. March's<br/>departure.<br/><br/>"I'm too tired to go this afternoon," replied Meg, rocking<br/>comfortably as she sewed.<br/><br/>"Can't you, Jo?" asked Beth.<br/>
