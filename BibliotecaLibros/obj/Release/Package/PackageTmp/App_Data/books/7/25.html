<br/>"You must sit still all you can and keep your back out of sight.<br/>The front is all right. I shall have a new ribbon for my hair, and<br/>Marmee will lend me her little pearl pin, and my new slippers are<br/>lovely, and my gloves will do, though they aren't as nice as I'd<br/>like."<br/><br/>"Mine are spoiled with lemonade, and I can't get any new ones,<br/>so I shall have to go without," said Jo, who never troubled herself<br/>much about dress.<br/><br/>"You must have gloves, or I won't go," cried Meg decidedly.<br/>"Gloves are more important than anything else. You can't dance<br/>without them, and if you don't I should be so mortified."<br/><br/>"Then I'll stay still. I don't care much for company dancing.<br/>It's no fun to go sailing round. I like to fly about and cut<br/>capers."<br/><br/>"You can't ask Mother for new ones, they are so expensive, and<br/>you are so careless. She said when you spoiled the others that she<br/>shouldn't get you any more this winter. Can't you make them<br/>do?"<br/><br/>"I can hold them crumpled up in my hand, so no one will know how<br/>stained they are. That's all I can do. No! I'll tell you how we can<br/>manage, each wear one good one and carry a bad one. Don't you<br/>see?"<br/><br/>"Your hands are bigger than mine, and you will stretch my glove<br/>dreadfully," began Meg, whose gloves were a tender point with<br/>her.<br/><br/>"Then I'll go without. I don't care what people say!" cried Jo,<br/>taking up her book.<br/><br/>"You may have it, you may! Only don't stain it, and do behave<br/>nicely. Don't put your hands behind you, or stare, or say<br/>'Christopher Columbus!' will you?"<br/><br/>"Don't worry about me. I'll be as prim as I can and not get into<br/>any scrapes, if I can help it. Now go and answer your note, and let<br/>me finish this splendid story."<br/><br/>
