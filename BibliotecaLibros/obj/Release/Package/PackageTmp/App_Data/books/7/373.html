<br/>"Am I selfish?" the question slipped out involuntarily and in a<br/>tone of surprise, for the one virtue on which he prided himself was<br/>generosity.<br/><br/>"Yes, very selfish," continued Amy, in a calm, cool voice, twice<br/>as effective just then as an angry one. "I'll show you how, for<br/>I've studied you while we were frolicking, and I'm not at all<br/>satisfied with you. Here you have been abroad nearly six months,<br/>and done nothing but waste time and money and disappoint your<br/>friends."<br/><br/>"Isn't a fellow to have any pleasure after a four-year<br/>grind?"<br/><br/>"You don't look as if you'd had much. At any rate, you are none<br/>the better for it, as far as I can see. I said when we first met<br/>that you had improved. Now I take it all back, for I don't think<br/>you half so nice as when I left you at home. You have grown<br/>abominably lazy, you like gossip, and waste time on frivolous<br/>things, you are contented to be petted and admired by silly people,<br/>instead of being loved and respected by wise ones. With money,<br/>talent, position, health, and beauty, ah you like that old Vanity!<br/>But it's the truth, so I can't help saying it, with all these<br/>splendid things to use and enjoy, you can find nothing to do but<br/>dawdle, and instead of being the man you ought to be, you are onlyâ€¦<br/>" there she stopped, with a look that had both pain and pity in<br/>it.<br/><br/>"Saint Laurence on a gridiron," added Laurie, blandly finishing<br/>the sentence. But the lecture began to take effect, for there was a<br/>wide-awake sparkle in his eyes now and a half-angry, half-injured<br/>expression replaced the former indifference.<br/><br/>"I supposed you'd take it so. You men tell us we are angels, and<br/>say we can make you what we will, but the instant we honestly try<br/>to do you good, you laugh at us and won't listen, which proves how<br/>much your flattery is worth." Amy spoke bitterly, and turned her<br/>back on the exasperating martyr at her feet.<br/><br/>In a minute a hand came down over the page, so that she could<br/>not draw, and Laurie's voice said, with a droll imitation of a<br/>penitent child, "I will be good, oh, I will be good!"<br/><br/>But Amy did not laugh, for she was in earnest, and tapping on<br/>the outspread hand with her pencil, said soberly, "Aren't you<br/>ashamed of a hand like that? It's as soft and white as a woman's,<br/>and looks as if it never did anything but wear Jouvin's best gloves<br/>and pick flowers for ladies. You are not a dandy, thank Heaven, so<br/>I'm glad to see there are no diamonds or big seal rings on it, only<br/>the little old one Jo gave you so long ago. Dear soul, I wish she<br/>was here to help me!"<br/><br/>"So do I!"<br/><br/>The hand vanished as suddenly as it came, and there was energy<br/>enough in the echo of her wish to suit even Amy. She glanced down<br/>at him with a new thought in her mind, but he was lying with his<br/>hat half over his face, as if for shade, and his mustache hid his<br/>mouth. She only saw his chest rise and fall, with a long breath<br/>that might have been a sigh, and the hand that wore the ring<br/>nestled down into the grass, as if to hide something too precious<br/>or too tender to be spoken of. All in a minute various hints and<br/>trifles assumed shape and significance in Amy's mind, and told her<br/>what her sister never had confided to her. She remembered that<br/>Laurie never spoke voluntarily of Jo, she recalled the shadow on<br/>his face just now, the change in his character, and the wearing of<br/>the little old ring which was no ornament to a handsome hand. Girls<br/>are quick to read such signs and feel their eloquence. Amy had<br/>fancied that perhaps a love trouble was at the bottom of the<br/>alteration, and now she was sure of it. Her keen eyes filled, and<br/>when she spoke again, it was in a voice that could be beautifully<br/>soft and kind when she chose to make it so.<br/><br/>
