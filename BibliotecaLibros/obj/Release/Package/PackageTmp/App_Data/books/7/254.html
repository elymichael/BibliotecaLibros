<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>3<br/>Artistic Attempts<br/><br/><br/>It takes people a long time to learn the difference between<br/>talent and genius, especially ambitious young men and women. Amy<br/>was learning this distinction through much tribulation, for<br/>mistaking enthusiasm for inspiration, she attempted every branch of<br/>art with youthful audacity. For a long time there was a lull in the<br/>'mud-pie' business, and she devoted herself to the finest<br/>pen-and-ink drawing, in which she showed such taste and skill that<br/>her graceful handiwork proved both pleasant and profitable. But<br/>over-strained eyes caused pen and ink to be laid aside for a bold<br/>attempt at poker-sketching. While this attack lasted, the family<br/>lived in constant fear of a conflagration, for the odor of burning<br/>wood pervaded the house at all hours, smoke issued from attic and<br/>shed with alarming frequency, red-hot pokers lay about<br/>promiscuously, and Hannah never went to bed without a pail of water<br/>and the dinner bell at her door in case of fire. Raphael's face was<br/>found boldly executed on the underside of the moulding board, and<br/>Bacchus on the head of a beer barrel. A chanting cherub adorned the<br/>cover of the sugar bucket, and attempts to portray Romeo and Juliet<br/>supplied kindling for some time.<br/><br/>From fire to oil was a natural transition for burned fingers,<br/>and Amy fell to painting with undiminished ardor. An artist friend<br/>fitted her out with his castoff palettes, brushes, and colors, and<br/>she daubed away, producing pastoral and marine views such as were<br/>never seen on land or sea. Her monstrosities in the way of cattle<br/>would have taken prizes at an agricultural fair, and the perilous<br/>pitching of her vessels would have produced seasickness in the most<br/>nautical observer, if the utter disregard to all known rules of<br/>shipbuilding and rigging had not convulsed him with laughter at the<br/>first glance. Swarthy boys and dark-eyed Madonnas, staring at you<br/>from one corner of the studio, suggested Murillo; oily brown<br/>shadows of faces with a lurid streak in the wrong place, meant<br/>Rembrandt; buxom ladies and dropiscal infants, Rubens; and Turner<br/>appeared in tempests of blue thunder, orange lightning, brown rain,<br/>and purple clouds, with a tomato-colored splash in the middle,<br/>which might be the sun or a bouy, a sailor's shirt or a king's<br/>robe, as the spectator pleased.<br/><br/>Charcoal portraits came next, and the entire family hung in a<br/>row, looking as wild and crocky as if just evoked from a coalbin.<br/>Softened into crayon sketches, they did better, for the likenesses<br/>were good, and Amy's hair, Jo's nose, Meg's mouth, and Laurie's<br/>eyes were pronounced 'wonderfully fine'. A return to clay and<br/>plaster followed, and ghostly casts of her acquaintances haunted<br/>corners of the house, or tumbled off closet shelves onto people's<br/>heads. Children were enticed in as models, till their incoherent<br/>accounts of her mysterious doings caused Miss Amy to be regarded in<br/>the light of a young ogress. Her efforts in this line, however,<br/>were brought to an abrupt close by an untoward accident, which<br/>quenched her ardor. Other models failing her for a time, she<br/>undertook to cast her own pretty foot, and the family were one day<br/>alarmed by an unearthly bumping and screaming and running to the<br/>rescue, found the young enthusiast hopping wildly about the shed<br/>with her foot held fast in a pan full of plaster, which had<br/>hardened with unexpected rapidity. With much difficulty and some<br/>danger she was dug out, for Jo was so overcome with laughter while<br/>she excavated that her knife went too far, cut the poor foot, and<br/>left a lasting memorial of one artistic attempt, at least.<br/><br/>After this Amy subsided, till a mania for sketching from nature<br/>set her to haunting river, field, and wood, for picturesque<br/>studies, and sighing for ruins to copy. She caught endless colds<br/>sitting on damp grass to book 'a delicious bit', composed of a<br/>stone, a stump, one mushroom, and a broken mullein stalk, or 'a<br/>heavenly mass of clouds', that looked like a choice display of<br/>featherbeds when done. She sacrificed her complexion floating on<br/>the river in the midsummer sun to study light and shade, and got a<br/>wrinkle over her nose trying after 'points of sight', or whatever<br/>the squint-and-string performance is called.<br/><br/>If 'genius is eternal patience', as Michelangelo affirms, Amy<br/>had some claim to the divine attribute, for she persevered in spite<br/>of all obstacles, failures, and discouragements, firmly believing<br/>that in time she should do something worthy to be called 'high<br/>art'.<br/><br/>She was learning, doing, and enjoying other things, meanwhile,<br/>for she had resolved to be an attractive and accomplished woman,<br/>even if she never became a great artist. Here she succeeded better,<br/>for she was one of those happily created beings who please without<br/>effort, make friends everywhere, and take life so gracefully and<br/>easily that less fortunate souls are tempted to believe that such<br/>are born under a lucky star. Everybody liked her, for among her<br/>good gifts was tact. She had an instinctive sense of what was<br/>pleasing and proper, always said the right thing to the right<br/>person, did just what suited the time and place, and was so<br/>self-possessed that her sisters used to say, "If Amy went to court<br/>without any rehearsal beforehand, she'd know exactly what to<br/>do."<br/><br/>One of her weaknesses was a desire to move in 'our best<br/>society', without being quite sure what the best really was. Money,<br/>position, fashionable accomplishments, and elegant manners were<br/>most desirable things in her eyes, and she liked to associate with<br/>those who possessed them, often mistaking the false for the true,<br/>and admiring what was not admirable. Never forgetting that by birth<br/>she was a gentlewoman, she cultivated her aristocratic tastes and<br/>feelings, so that when the opportunity came she might be ready to<br/>take the place from which poverty now excluded her.<br/>
