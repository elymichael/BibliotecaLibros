"He won't stay there, he never does unless I sit by him."<br/><br/>"I'll manage him. Demi, go upstairs, and get into your bed, as<br/>Mamma bids you."<br/><br/>"S'ant!" replied the young rebel, helping himself to the coveted<br/>'cakie', and beginning to eat the same with calm audacity.<br/><br/>"You must never say that to Papa. I shall carry you if you don't<br/>go yourself."<br/><br/>"Go 'way, me don't love Parpar." and Demi retired to his<br/>mother's skirts for protection.<br/><br/>But even that refuge proved unavailing, for he was delivered<br/>over to the enemy, with a "Be gentle with him, John," which struck<br/>the culprit with dismay, for when Mamma deserted him, then the<br/>judgment day was at hand. Bereft of his cake, defrauded of his<br/>frolic, and borne away by a strong hand to that detested bed, poor<br/>Demi could not restrain his wrath, but openly defied Papa, and<br/>kicked and screamed lustily all the way upstairs. The minute he was<br/>put into bed on one side, he rolled out on the other, and made for<br/>the door, only to be ignominiously caught up by the tail of his<br/>little toga and put back again, which lively performance was kept<br/>up till the young man's strength gave out, when he devoted himself<br/>to roaring at the top of his voice. This vocal exercise usually<br/>conquered Meg, but John sat as unmoved as the post which is<br/>popularly believed to be deaf. No coaxing, no sugar, no lullaby, no<br/>story, even the light was put out and only the red glow of the fire<br/>enlivened the 'big dark' which Demi regarded with curiosity rather<br/>than fear. This new order of things disgusted him, and he howled<br/>dismally for 'Marmar', as his angry passions subsided, and<br/>recollections of his tender bondwoman returned to the captive<br/>autocrat. The plaintive wail which succeeded the passionate roar<br/>went to Meg's heart, and she ran up to say beseechinglyâ€¦<br/><br/>"Let me stay with him, he'll be good now, John."<br/><br/>"No, my dear. I've told him he must go to sleep, as you bid him,<br/>and he must, if I stay here all night."<br/><br/>"But he'll cry himself sick," pleaded Meg, reproaching herself<br/>for deserting her boy.<br/><br/>"No, he won't, he's so tired he will soon drop off and then the<br/>matter is settled, for he will understand that he has got to mind.<br/>Don't interfere, I'll manage him."<br/><br/>"He's my child, and I can't have his spirit broken by<br/>harshness."<br/>
