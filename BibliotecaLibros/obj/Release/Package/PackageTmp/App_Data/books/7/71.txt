Jo
Meets Apollyon


"Girls, where are you going?" asked Amy, coming into their room
one Saturday afternoon, and finding them getting ready to go out
with an air of secrecy which excited her curiosity.

"Never mind. Little girls shouldn't ask questions," returned Jo
sharply.

Now if there is anything mortifying to our feelings when we are
young, it is to be told that, and to be bidden to "run away, dear"
is still more trying to us. Amy bridled up at this insult, and
determined to find out the secret, if she teased for an hour.
Turning to Meg, who never refused her anything very long, she said
coaxingly, "Do tell me! I should think you might let me go, too,
for Beth is fussing over her piano, and I haven't got anything to
do, and am so lonely."

"I can't, dear, because you aren't invited," began Meg, but Jo
broke in impatiently, "Now, Meg, be quiet or you will spoil it all.
You can't go, Amy, so don't be a baby and whine about it."

"You are going somewhere with Laurie, I know you are. You were
whispering and laughing together on the sofa last night, and you
stopped when I came in. Aren't you going with him?"

"Yes, we are. Now do be still, and stop bothering."

Amy held her tongue, but used her eyes, and saw Meg slip a fan
into her pocket.
