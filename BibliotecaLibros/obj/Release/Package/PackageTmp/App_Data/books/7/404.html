Nobody knew where the evening went to, for Hannah skillfully<br/>abstracted the babies at an early hour, nodding like two rosy<br/>poppies, and Mr. Laurence went home to rest. The others sat round<br/>the fire, talking away, utterly regardless of the lapse of time,<br/>till Meg, whose maternal mind was impressed with a firm conviction<br/>that Daisy had tumbled out of bed, and Demi set his nightgown afire<br/>studying the structure of matches, made a move to go.<br/><br/>"We must have our sing, in the good old way, for we are all<br/>together again once more," said Jo, feeling that a good shout would<br/>be a safe and pleasant vent for the jubilant emotions of her<br/>soul.<br/><br/>They were not all there. But no one found the words thougtless<br/>or untrue, for Beth still seemed among them, a peaceful presence,<br/>invisible, but dearer than ever, since death could not break the<br/>household league that love made disoluble. The little chair stood<br/>in its old place. The tidy basket, with the bit of work she left<br/>unfinished when the needle grew 'so heavy', was still on its<br/>accustomed shelf. The beloved instrument, seldom touched now had<br/>not been moved, and above it Beth's face, serene and smiling, as in<br/>the early days, looked down upon them, seeming to say, "Be happy. I<br/>am here."<br/><br/>"Play something, Amy. Let them hear how much you have improved,"<br/>said Laurie, with pardonable pride in his promising pupil.<br/><br/>But Amy whispered, with full eyes, as she twirled the faded<br/>stool, "Not tonight, dear. I can't show off tonight."<br/><br/>But she did show something better than brilliancy or skill, for<br/>she sang Beth's songs with a tender music in her voice which the<br/>best master could not have taught, and touched the listener's<br/>hearts with a sweeter power than any other inspiration could have<br/>given her. The room was very still, when the clear voice failed<br/>suddenly at the last line of Beth's favorite hymn. It was hard to<br/>say…<br/><br/><br/>Earth hath no sorrow that heaven cannot heal;<br/><br/><br/>and Amy leaned against her husband, who stood<br/>behind her, feeling that her welcome home was not quite perfect<br/>without Beth's kiss.<br/><br/>"Now, we must finish with Mignon's song, for Mr. Bhaer sings<br/>that," said Jo, before the pause grew painful. And Mr. Bhaer<br/>cleared his throat with a gratified "Hem!" as he stepped into the<br/>corner where Jo stood, saying…<br/><br/>"You will sing with me? We go excellently well together."<br/>
