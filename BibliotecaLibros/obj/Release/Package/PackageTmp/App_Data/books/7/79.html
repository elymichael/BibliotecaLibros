"I hope you will be a great deal better, dear, but you must keep<br/>watch over your 'bosom enemy', as father calls it, or it may<br/>sadden, if not spoil your life. You have had a warning. Remember<br/>it, and try with heart and soul to master this quick temper, before<br/>it brings you greater sorrow and regret than you have known<br/>today."<br/><br/>"I will try, Mother, I truly will. But you must help me, remind<br/>me, and keep me from flying out. I used to see Father sometimes put<br/>his finger on his lips, and look at you with a very kind but sober<br/>face, and you always folded your lips tight and went away. Was he<br/>reminding you then?" asked Jo softly.<br/><br/>"Yes. I asked him to help me so, and he never forgot it, but<br/>saved me from many a sharp word by that little gesture and kind<br/>look."<br/><br/>Jo saw that her mother's eyes filled and her lips trembled as<br/>she spoke, and fearing that she had said too much, she whispered<br/>anxiously, "Was it wrong to watch you and to speak of it? I didn't<br/>mean to be rude, but it's so comfortable to say all I think to you,<br/>and feel so safe and happy here."<br/><br/>"My Jo, you may say anything to your mother, for it is my<br/>greatest happiness and pride to feel that my girls confide in me<br/>and know how much I love them."<br/><br/>"I thought I'd grieved you."<br/><br/>"No, dear, but speaking of Father reminded me how much I miss<br/>him, how much I owe him, and how faithfully I should watch and work<br/>to keep his little daughters safe and good for him."<br/><br/>"Yet you told him to go, Mother, and didn't cry when he went,<br/>and never complain now, or seem as if you needed any help," said<br/>Jo, wondering.<br/><br/>"I gave my best to the country I love, and kept my tears till he<br/>was gone. Why should I complain, when we both have merely done our<br/>duty and will surely be the happier for it in the end? If I don't<br/>seem to need help, it is because I have a better friend, even than<br/>Father, to comfort and sustain me. My child, the troubles and<br/>temptations of your life are beginning and may be many, but you can<br/>overcome and outlive them all if you learn to feel the strength and<br/>tenderness of your Heavenly Father as you do that of your earthly<br/>one. The more you love and trust Him, the nearer you will feel to<br/>Him, and the less you will depend on human power and wisdom. His<br/>love and care never tire or change, can never be taken from you,<br/>but may become the source of lifelong peace, happiness, and<br/>strength. Believe this heartily, and go to God with all your little<br/>cares, and hopes, and sins, and sorrows, as freely and confidingly<br/>as you come to your mother."<br/><br/>Jo's only answer was to hold her mother close, and in the<br/>silence which followed the sincerest prayer she had ever prayed<br/>left her heart without words. For in that sad yet happy hour, she<br/>had learned not only the bitterness of remorse and despair, but the<br/>sweetness of self-denial and self-control, and led by her mother's<br/>hand, she had drawn nearer to the Friend who always welcomes every<br/>child with a love stronger than that of any father, tenderer than<br/>that of any mother.<br/><br/>Amy stirred and sighed in her sleep, and as if eager to begin at<br/>once to mend her fault, Jo looked up with an expression on her face<br/>which it had never worn before.<br/>
