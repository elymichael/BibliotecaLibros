"That you love that old man."

"What old man?" demanded Jo, thinking he must mean his
grandfather.

"That devilish Professor you were always writing about. If you
say you love him, I know I shall do something desperate;" and he
looked as if he would keep his word, as he clenched his hands with
a wrathful spark in his eyes.

Jo wanted to laugh, but restrained herself and said warmly, for
she too, was getting excited with all this, "Don't swear, Teddy! He
isn't old, nor anything bad, but good and kind, and the best friend
I've got, next to you. Pray, don't fly into a passion. I want to be
kind, but I know I shall get angry if you abuse my Professor. I
haven't the least idea of loving him or anybody else."

"But you will after a while, and then what will become of
me?"

"You'll love someone else too, like a sensible boy, and forget
all this trouble."

"I can't love anyone else, and I'll never forget you, Jo, Never!
Never!" with a stamp to emphasize his passionate words.

"What shall I do with him?" sighed Jo, finding that emotions
were more unmanagable than she expected. "You haven't heard what I
wanted to tell you. Sit down and listen, for indeed I want to do
right and make you happy," she said, hoping to soothe him with a
little reason, which proved that she knew nothing about love.

Seeing a ray of hope in that last speech, Laurie threw himself
down on the grass at her feet, leaned his arm on the lower step of
the stile, and looked up at her with an expectant face. Now that
arrangement was not conducive to calm speech or clear thought on
Jo's part, for how could she say hard things to her boy while he
watched her with eyes full of love and longing, and lashes still
wet with the bitter drop or two her hardness of heart had wrung
from him? She gently turned his head away, saying, as she stroked
the wavy hair which had been allowed to grow for her sake—how
touching that was, to be sure! "I agree with Mother that you and I
are not suited to each other, because our quick tempers and strong
wills would probably make us very miserable, if we were so foolish
as to… " Jo paused a little over the last word, but Laurie uttered
it with a rapturous expression.

"Marry—no we shouldn't! If you loved me, Jo, I should be a
perfect saint, for you could make me anything you like."
