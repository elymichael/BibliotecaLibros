<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>24<br/>Harvest Time<br/><br/><br/>For a year Jo and her Professor worked and waited, hoped and<br/>loved, met occasionally, and wrote such voluminous letters that the<br/>rise in the price of paper was accounted for, Laurie said. The<br/>second year began rather soberly, for their prospects did not<br/>brighten, and Aunt March died suddenly. But when their first sorrow<br/>was over—for they loved the old lady in spite of her sharp<br/>tongue—they found they had cause for rejoicing, for she had left<br/>Plumfield to Jo, which made all sorts of joyful things<br/>possible.<br/><br/>"It's a fine old place, and will bring a handsome sum, for of<br/>course you intend to sell it," said Laurie, as they were all<br/>talking the matter over some weeks later.<br/><br/>"No, I don't," was Jo's decided answer, as she petted the fat<br/>poodle, whom she had adopted, out of respect to his former<br/>mistress.<br/><br/>"You don't mean to live there?"<br/><br/>"Yes, I do."<br/><br/>"But, my dear girl, it's an immense house, and will take a power<br/>of money to keep it in order. The garden and orchard alone need two<br/>or three men, and farming isn't in Bhaer's line, I take it."<br/><br/>"He'll try his hand at it there, if I propose it."<br/>
