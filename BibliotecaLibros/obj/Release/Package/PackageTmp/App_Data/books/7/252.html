<br/>A demand so sudden and so serious made the young man hesitate a<br/>moment, for ridicule is often harder to bear than self-denial. Meg<br/>knew that if he gave the promise he would keep it at all costs, and<br/>feeling her power, used it as a woman may for her friend's good.<br/>She did not speak, but she looked up at him with a face made very<br/>eloquent by happiness, and a smile which said, "No one can refuse<br/>me anything today."<br/><br/>Laurie certainly could not, and with an answering smile, he gave<br/>her his hand, saying heartily, "I promise, Mrs. Brooke!"<br/><br/>"I thank you, very, very much."<br/><br/>"And I drink 'long life to your resolution', Teddy," cried Jo,<br/>baptizing him with a splash of lemonade, as she waved her glass and<br/>beamed approvingly upon him.<br/><br/>So the toast was drunk, the pledge made and loyally kept in<br/>spite of many temptations, for with instinctive wisdom, the girls<br/>seized a happy moment to do their friend a service, for which he<br/>thanked them all his life.<br/><br/>After lunch, people strolled about, by twos and threes, through<br/>the house and garden, enjoying the sunshine without and within. Meg<br/>and John happened to be standing together in the middle of the<br/>grass plot, when Laurie was seized with an inspiration which put<br/>the finishing touch to this unfashionable wedding.<br/><br/>"All the married people take hands and dance round the new-made<br/>husband and wife, as the Germans do, while we bachelors and<br/>spinsters prance in couples outside!" cried Laurie, promenading<br/>down the path with Amy, with such infectious spirit and skill that<br/>everyone else followed their example without a murmur. Mr. and Mrs.<br/>March, Aunt and Uncle Carrol began it, others rapidly joined in,<br/>even Sallie Moffat, after a moment's hesitation, threw her train<br/>over her arm and whisked Ned into the ring. But the crowning joke<br/>was Mr. Laurence and Aunt March, for when the stately old gentleman<br/>chasseed solemnly up to the old lady, she just tucked her cane<br/>under her arm, and hopped briskly away to join hands with the rest<br/>and dance about the bridal pair, while the young folks pervaded the<br/>garden like butterflies on a midsummer day.<br/><br/>Want of breath brought the impromptu ball to a close, and then<br/>people began to go.<br/><br/>"I wish you well, my dear, I heartily wish you well, but I think<br/>you'll be sorry for it," said Aunt March to Meg, adding to the<br/>bridegroom, as he led her to the carriage, "You've got a treasure,<br/>young man, see that you deserve it."<br/><br/>"That is the prettiest wedding I've been to for an age, Ned, and<br/>I don't see why, for there wasn't a bit of style about it,"<br/>observed Mrs. Moffat to her husband, as they drove away.<br/><br/>
