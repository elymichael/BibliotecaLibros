<br/>"I'd take it manfully, and be respected if I couldn't be loved,"<br/>said Amy, with the decision of one who knew nothing about it.<br/><br/>Now, Laurie flattered himself that he had borne it remarkably<br/>well, making no moan, asking no sympathy, and taking his trouble<br/>away to live it down alone. Amy's lecture put the matter in a new<br/>light, and for the first time it did look weak and selfish to lose<br/>heart at the first failure, and shut himself up in moody<br/>indifference. He felt as if suddenly shaken out of a pensive dream<br/>and found it impossible to go to sleep again. Presently he sat up<br/>and asked slowly, "Do you think Jo would despise me as you do?"<br/><br/>"Yes, if she saw you now. She hates lazy people. Why don't you<br/>do something splendid, and make her love you?"<br/><br/>"I did my best, but it was no use."<br/><br/>"Graduating well, you mean? That was no more than you ought to<br/>have done, for your grandfather's sake. It would have been shameful<br/>to fail after spending so much time and money, when everyone knew<br/>that you could do well."<br/><br/>"I did fail, say what you will, for Jo wouldn't love me," began<br/>Laurie, leaning his head on his hand in a despondent attitude.<br/><br/>"No, you didn't, and you'll say so in the end, for it did you<br/>good, and proved that you could do something if you tried. If you'd<br/>only set about another task of some sort, you'd soon be your<br/>hearty, happy self again, and forget your trouble."<br/><br/>"That's impossible."<br/><br/>"Try it and see. You needn't shrug your shoulders, and think,<br/>'Much she knows about such things'. I don't pretend to be wise, but<br/>I am observing, and I see a great deal more than you'd imagine. I'm<br/>interested in other people's experiences and inconsistencies, and<br/>though I can't explain, I remember and use them for my own benefit.<br/>Love Jo all your days, if you choose, but don't let it spoil you,<br/>for it's wicked to throw away so many good gifts because you can't<br/>have the one you want. There, I won't lecture any more, for I know<br/>you'll wake up and be a man in spite of that hardhearted girl."<br/><br/>Neither spoke for several minutes. Laurie sat turning the little<br/>ring on his finger, and Amy put the last touches to the hasty<br/>sketch she had been working at while she talked. Presently she put<br/>it on his knee, merely saying, "How do you like that?"<br/><br/>
