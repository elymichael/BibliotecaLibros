<br/>Old six-foot Snodgrass looms on high,<br/>With elephantine grace,<br/>And beams upon the company,<br/>With brown and jovial face.<br/><br/>Poetic fire lights up his eye,<br/>He struggles 'gainst his lot.<br/>Behold ambition on his brow,<br/>And on his nose, a blot.<br/><br/>Next our peaceful Tupman comes,<br/>So rosy, plump, and sweet,<br/>Who chokes with laughter at the puns,<br/>And tumbles off his seat.<br/><br/>Prim little Winkle too is here,<br/>With every hair in place,<br/>A model of propriety,<br/>Though he hates to wash his face.<br/><br/>
