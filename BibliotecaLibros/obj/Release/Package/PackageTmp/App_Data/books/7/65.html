<br/>"In debt, Amy? What do you mean?" And Meg looked sober.<br/><br/>"Why, I owe at least a dozen pickled limes, and I can't pay<br/>them, you know, till I have money, for Marmee forbade my having<br/>anything charged at the shop."<br/><br/>"Tell me all about it. Are limes the fashion now? It used to be<br/>pricking bits of rubber to make balls." And Meg tried to keep her<br/>countenance, Amy looked so grave and important.<br/><br/>"Why, you see, the girls are always buying them, and unless you<br/>want to be thought mean, you must do it too. It's nothing but limes<br/>now, for everyone is sucking them in their desks in schooltime, and<br/>trading them off for pencils, bead rings, paper dolls, or something<br/>else, at recess. If one girl likes another, she gives her a lime.<br/>If she's mad with her, she eats one before her face, and doesn't<br/>offer even a suck. They treat by turns, and I've had ever so many<br/>but haven't returned them, and I ought for they are debts of honor,<br/>you know."<br/><br/>"How much will pay them off and restore your credit?" asked Meg,<br/>taking out her purse.<br/><br/>"A quarter would more than do it, and leave a few cents over for<br/>a treat for you. Don't you like limes?"<br/><br/>"Not much. You may have my share. Here's the money. Make it last<br/>as long as you can, for it isn't very plenty, you know."<br/><br/>"Oh, thank you! It must be so nice to have pocket money! I'll<br/>have a grand feast, for I haven't tasted a lime this week. I felt<br/>delicate about taking any, as I couldn't return them, and I'm<br/>actually suffering for one."<br/><br/>Next day Amy was rather late at school, but could not resist the<br/>temptation of displaying, with pardonable pride, a moist<br/>brown-paper parcel, before she consigned it to the inmost recesses<br/>of her desk. During the next few minutes the rumor that Amy March<br/>had got twenty-four delicious limes (she ate one on the way) and<br/>was going to treat circulated through her 'set', and the attentions<br/>of her friends became quite overwhelming. Katy Brown invited her to<br/>her next party on the spot. Mary Kinglsey insisted on lending her<br/>her watch till recess, and Jenny Snow, a satirical young lady, who<br/>had basely twitted Amy upon her limeless state, promptly buried the<br/>hatchet and offered to furnish answers to certain appalling sums.<br/>But Amy had not forgotten Miss Snow's cutting remarks about 'some<br/>persons whose noses were not too flat to smell other people's<br/>limes, and stuck-up people who were not too proud to ask for them',<br/>and she instantly crushed 'that Snow girl's' hopes by the withering<br/>telegram, "You needn't be so polite all of a sudden, for you won't<br/>get any."<br/><br/>A distinguished personage happened to visit the school that<br/>morning, and Amy's beautifully drawn maps received praise, which<br/>honor to her foe rankled in the soul of Miss Snow, and caused Miss<br/>March to assume the airs of a studious young peacock. But, alas,<br/>alas! Pride goes before a fall, and the revengeful Snow turned the<br/>tables with disastrous success. No sooner had the guest paid the<br/>usual stale compliments and bowed himself out, than Jenny, under<br/>pretense of asking an important question, informed Mr. Davis, the<br/>teacher, that Amy March had pickled limes in her desk.<br/><br/>
