<br/>She always used to take his arm on these occasions, now she did<br/>not, and he made no complaint, which was a bad sign, but talked on<br/>rapidly about all sorts of faraway subjects, till they turned from<br/>the road into the little path that led homeward through the grove.<br/>Then he walked more slowly, suddenly lost his fine flow of<br/>language, and now and then a dreadful pause occurred. To rescue the<br/>conversation from one of the wells of silence into which it kept<br/>falling, Jo said hastily, "Now you must have a good long<br/>holiday!"<br/><br/>"I intend to."<br/><br/>Something in his resolute tone made Jo look up quickly to find<br/>him looking down at her with an expression that assured her the<br/>dreaded moment had come, and made her put out her hand with an<br/>imploring, "No, Teddy. Please don't!"<br/><br/>"I will, and you must hear me. It's no use, Jo, we've got to<br/>have it out, and the sooner the better for both of us," he<br/>answered, getting flushed and excited all at once.<br/><br/>"Say what you like then. I'll listen," said Jo, with a desperate<br/>sort of patience.<br/><br/>Laurie was a young lover, but he was in earnest, and meant to<br/>'have it out', if he died in the attempt, so he plunged into the<br/>subject with characteristic impetuousity, saying in a voice that<br/>would get choky now and then, in spite of manful efforts to keep it<br/>steady…<br/><br/>"I've loved you ever since I've known you, Jo, couldn't help it,<br/>you've been so good to me. I've tried to show it, but you wouldn't<br/>let me. Now I'm going to make you hear, and give me an answer, for<br/>I can't go on so any longer."<br/><br/>"I wanted to save you this. I thought you'd understand… " began<br/>Jo, finding it a great deal harder than she expected.<br/><br/>"I know you did, but the girls are so queer you never know what<br/>they mean. They say no when they mean yes, and drive a man out of<br/>his wits just for the fun of it," returned Laurie, entrenching<br/>himself behind an undeniable fact.<br/><br/>"I don't. I never wanted to make you care for me so, and I went<br/>away to keep you from it if I could."<br/><br/>
