The songs she sang, without lament,<br/>In her prison-house of pain,<br/>Forever are they sweetly blent<br/>With the falling summer rain.<br/><br/>Upon the last lid's polished fieldâ€”<br/>Legend now both fair and true<br/>A gallant knight bears on his shield,<br/>"Amy" in letters gold and blue.<br/>Within lie snoods that bound her hair,<br/>Slippers that have danced their last,<br/>Faded flowers laid by with care,<br/>Fans whose airy toils are past,<br/>Gay valentines, all ardent flames,<br/>Trifles that have borne their part<br/>In girlish hopes and fears and shames,<br/>The record of a maiden heart<br/>Now learning fairer, truer spells,<br/>Hearing, like a blithe refrain,<br/>The silver sound of bridal bells<br/>In the falling summer rain.<br/>
