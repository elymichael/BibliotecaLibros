I'm in such a state of<br/>exhaustion I can't get home without help.

"You must promise to<br/>behave well, and not cut up any pranks, and spoil our plans."<br/><br/>"Not a prank."<br/><br/>"And don't say funny things when we ought to be sober."<br/><br/>"I never do. You are the one for that."<br/><br/>"And I implore you not to look at me during the ceremony. I<br/>shall certainly laugh if you do."<br/><br/>
