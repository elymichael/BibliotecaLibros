"Who cares?" said Jo.<br/><br/>"I guess he'll like it," added Beth.<br/><br/>"Of course I shall! I give you my word I won't laugh. Tell away,<br/>Jo, and don't be afraid."<br/><br/>"The idea of being afraid of you! Well, you see we used to play<br/>Pilgrim's Progress, and we have been going on with it in earnest,<br/>all winter and summer."<br/><br/>"Yes, I know," said Laurie, nodding wisely.<br/><br/>"Who told you?" demanded Jo.<br/><br/>"Spirits."<br/><br/>"No, I did. I wanted to amuse him one night when you were all<br/>away, and he was rather dismal. He did like it, so don't scold,<br/>Jo," said Beth meekly.<br/><br/>"You can't keep a secret. Never mind, it saves trouble now."<br/><br/>"Go on, please," said Laurie, as Jo became absorbed in her work,<br/>looking a trifle displeased.<br/><br/>"Oh, didn't she tell you about this new plan of ours? Well, we<br/>have tried not to waste our holiday, but each has had a task and<br/>worked at it with a will. The vacation is nearly over, the stints<br/>are all done, and we are ever so glad that we didn't dawdle."<br/>
