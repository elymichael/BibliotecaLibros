Something in the boy's face troubled his little friend, but she<br/>said cheerfully, with her quiet eyes on the changing clouds, "If<br/>people really want to go, and really try all their lives, I think<br/>they will get in, for I don't believe there are any locks on that<br/>door or any guards at the gate. I always imagine it is as it is in<br/>the picture, where the shining ones stretch out their hands to<br/>welcome poor Christian as he comes up from the river."<br/><br/>"Wouldn't it be fun if all the castles in the air which we make<br/>could come true, and we could live in them?" said Jo, after a<br/>little pause.<br/><br/>"I've made such quantities it would be hard to choose which I'd<br/>have," said Laurie, lying flat and throwing cones at the squirrel<br/>who had betrayed him.<br/><br/>"You'd have to take your favorite one. What is it?" asked<br/>Meg.<br/><br/>"If I tell mine, will you tell yours?"<br/><br/>"Yes, if the girls will too."<br/><br/>"We will. Now, Laurie."<br/><br/>"After I'd seen as much of the world as I want to, I'd like to<br/>settle in Germany and have just as much music as I choose. I'm to<br/>be a famous musician myself, and all creation is to rush to hear<br/>me. And I'm never to be bothered about money or business, but just<br/>enjoy myself and live for what I like. That's my favorite castle.<br/>What's yours, Meg?"<br/><br/>Margaret seemed to find it a little hard to tell hers, and waved<br/>a brake before her face, as if to disperse imaginary gnats, while<br/>she said slowly, "I should like a lovely house, full of all sorts<br/>of luxurious thingsâ€”nice food, pretty clothes, handsome furniture,<br/>pleasant people, and heaps of money. I am to be mistress of it, and<br/>manage it as I like, with plenty of servants, so I never need work<br/>a bit. How I should enjoy it! For I wouldn't be idle, but do good,<br/>and make everyone love me dearly."<br/><br/>"Wouldn't you have a master for your castle in the air?" asked<br/>Laurie slyly.<br/><br/>"I said 'pleasant people', you know," and Meg carefully tied up<br/>her shoe as she spoke, so that no one saw her face.<br/>
