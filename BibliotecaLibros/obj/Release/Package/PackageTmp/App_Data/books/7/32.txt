"I hate it! Nothing but grinding or skylarking. And I don't like
the way fellows do either, in this country."

"What do you like?"

"To live in Italy, and to enjoy myself in my own way."

Jo wanted very much to ask what his own way was, but his black
brows looked rather threatening as he knit them, so she changed the
subject by saying, as her foot kept time, "That's a splendid polka!
Why don't you go and try it?"

"If you will come too," he answered, with a gallant little
bow.

"I can't, for I told Meg I wouldn't, becauseâ€¦ " There Jo
stopped, and looked undecided whether to tell or to laugh.

"Because, what?"

"You won't tell?"

"Never!"

"Well, I have a bad trick of standing before the fire, and so I
burn my frocks, and I scorched this one, and though it's nicely
mended, it shows, and Meg told me to keep still so no one would see
it. You may laugh, if you want to. It is funny, I know."

But Laurie didn't laugh. He only looked down a minute, and the
expression of his face puzzled Jo when he said very gently, "Never
mind that. I'll tell you how we can manage. There's a long hall out
there, and we can dance grandly, and no one will see us. Please
come."
