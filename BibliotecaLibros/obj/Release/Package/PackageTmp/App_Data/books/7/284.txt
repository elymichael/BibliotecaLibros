"Quite right and proper. I like your grateful spirit, my dear.
It's a pleasure to help people who appreciate our efforts. Some do
not, and that is trying," observed Aunt March, looking over her
spectacles at Jo, who sat apart, rocking herself, with a somewhat
morose expression.

If Jo had only known what a great happiness was wavering in the
balance for one of them, she would have turned dove-like in a
minute, but unfortunately, we don't have windows in our breasts,
and cannot see what goes on in the minds of our friends. Better for
us that we cannot as a general thing, but now and then it would be
such a comfort, such a saving of time and temper. By her next
speech, Jo deprived herself of several years of pleasure, and
received a timely lesson in the art of holding her tongue.

"I don't like favors, they oppress and make me feel like a
slave. I'd rather do everything for myself, and be perfectly
independent."

"Ahem!" coughed Aunt Carrol softly, with a look at Aunt
March.

"I told you so," said Aunt March, with a decided nod to Aunt
Carrol.

Mercifully unconscious of what she had done, Jo sat with her
nose in the air, and a revolutionary aspect which was anything but
inviting.

"Do you speak French, dear?" asked Mrs. Carrol, laying a hand on
Amy's.

"Pretty well, thanks to Aunt March, who lets Esther talk to me
as often as I like," replied Amy, with a grateful look, which
caused the old lady to smile affably.

"How are you about languages?" asked Mrs. Carrol of Jo.

"Don't know a word. I'm very stupid about studying anything,
can't bear French, it's such a slippery, silly sort of language,"
was the brusque reply.

Another look passed between the ladies, and Aunt March said to
Amy, "You are quite strong and well now, dear, I believe? Eyes
don't trouble you any more, do they?"
