<br/>"I'll tell you some day. John is going home with you, as I<br/>can't."<br/><br/>"No need of that. I am not a young lady, and it's only a step.<br/>Take care of yourself, won't you?"<br/><br/>"Yes, but you will come again, I hope?"<br/><br/>"If you promise to come and see us after you are well."<br/><br/>"I will."<br/><br/>"Good night, Laurie!"<br/><br/>"Good night, Jo, good night!"<br/><br/>When all the afternoon's adventures had been told, the family<br/>felt inclined to go visiting in a body, for each found something<br/>very attractive in the big house on the other side of the hedge.<br/>Mrs. March wanted to talk of her father with the old man who had<br/>not forgotten him, Meg longed to walk in the conservatory, Beth<br/>sighed for the grand piano, and Amy was eager to see the fine<br/>pictures and statues.<br/><br/>"Mother, why didn't Mr. Laurence like to have Laurie play?"<br/>asked Jo, who was of an inquiring disposition.<br/><br/>"I am not sure, but I think it was because his son, Laurie's<br/>father, married an Italian lady, a musician, which displeased the<br/>old man, who is very proud. The lady was good and lovely and<br/>accomplished, but he did not like her, and never saw his son after<br/>he married. They both died when Laurie was a little child, and then<br/>his grandfather took him home. I fancy the boy, who was born in<br/>Italy, is not very strong, and the old man is afraid of losing him,<br/>which makes him so careful. Laurie comes naturally by his love of<br/>music, for he is like his mother, and I dare say his grandfather<br/>fears that he may want to be a musician. At any rate, his skill<br/>reminds him of the woman he did not like, and so he 'glowered' as<br/>Jo said."<br/><br/>
