"Little Raphael," as her sisters called her, had a decided
talent for drawing, and was never so happy as when copying flowers,
designing fairies, or illustrating stories with queer specimens of
art. Her teachers complained that instead of doing her sums she
covered her slate with animals, the blank pages of her atlas were
used to copy maps on, and caricatures of the most ludicrous
description came fluttering out of all her books at unlucky
moments. She got through her lessons as well as she could, and
managed to escape reprimands by being a model of deportment. She
was a great favorite with her mates, being good-tempered and
possessing the happy art of pleasing without effort. Her little
airs and graces were much admired, so were her accomplishments, for
besides her drawing, she could play twelve tunes, crochet, and read
French without mispronouncing more than two-thirds of the words.
She had a plaintive way of saying, "When Papa was rich we did
so-and-so," which was very touching, and her long words were
considered 'perfectly elegant' by the girls.

Amy was in a fair way to be spoiled, for everyone petted her,
and her small vanities and selfishnesses were growing nicely. One
thing, however, rather quenched the vanities. She had to wear her
cousin's clothes. Now Florence's mama hadn't a particle of taste,
and Amy suffered deeply at having to wear a red instead of a blue
bonnet, unbecoming gowns, and fussy aprons that did not fit.
Everything was good, well made, and little worn, but Amy's artistic
eyes were much afflicted, especially this winter, when her school
dress was a dull purple with yellow dots and no trimming.

"My only comfort," she said to Meg, with tears in her eyes, "is
that Mother doesn't take tucks in my dresses whenever I'm naughty,
as Maria Parks's mother does. My dear, it's really dreadful, for
sometimes she is so bad her frock is up to her knees, and she can't
come to school. When I think of this deggerredation, I feegorcer I
can bear even my flat nose and purple gown with yellow skyrockets
on it."

Meg was Amy's confidant and monitor, and by some strange
attraction of opposites Jo was gentle Beth's. To Jo alone did the
shy child tell her thoughts, and over her big harum-scarum sister
Beth unconsciously exercised more influence than anyone in the
family. The two older girls were a great deal to one another, but
each took one of the younger sisters into her keeping and watched
over her in her own way, 'playing mother' they called it, and put
their sisters in the places of discarded dolls with the maternal
instinct of little women.

"Has anybody got anything to tell? It's been such a dismal day
I'm really dying for some amusement," said Meg, as they sat sewing
together that evening.

"I had a queer time with Aunt today, and, as I got the best of
it, I'll tell you about it," began Jo, who dearly loved to tell
stories. "I was reading that everlasting Belsham, and droning away
as I always do, for Aunt soon drops off, and then I take out some
nice book, and read like fury till she wakes up. I actually made
myself sleepy, and before she began to nod, I gave such a gape that
she asked me what I meant by opening my mouth wide enough to take
the whole book in at once."

"I wish I could, and be done with it," said I, trying not to be
saucy.

"Then she gave me a long lecture on my sins, and told me to sit
and think them over while she just 'lost' herself for a moment. She
never finds herself very soon, so the minute her cap began to bob
like a top-heavy dahlia, I whipped the&#160;
Vicar of
Wakefield
&#160;out of my pocket, and read away, with one eye
on him and one on Aunt. I'd just got to where they all tumbled into
the water when I forgot and laughed out loud. Aunt woke up and,
being more good-natured after her nap, told me to read a bit and
show what frivolous work I preferred to the worthy and instructive
Belsham. I did my very best, and she liked it, though she only
saidâ€¦

"'I don't understand what it's all about. Go back and begin it,
child.'"

"Back I went, and made the Primroses as interesting as ever I
could. Once I was wicked enough to stop in a thrilling place, and
say meekly, 'I'm afraid it tires you, ma'am. Shan't I stop
now?'"
