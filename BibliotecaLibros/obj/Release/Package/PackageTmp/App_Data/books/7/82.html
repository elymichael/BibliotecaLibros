<br/>&#160;<br/><br/>"It will look nice over my new muslin skirt, and the sash will<br/>set it off beautifully. I wish I hadn't smashed my coral bracelet,<br/>for you might have had it," said Jo, who loved to give and lend,<br/>but whose possessions were usually too dilapidated to be of much<br/>use.<br/><br/>"There is a lovely old-fashioned pearl set in the treasure<br/>chest, but Mother said real flowers were the prettiest ornament for<br/>a young girl, and Laurie promised to send me all I want," replied<br/>Meg. "Now, let me see, there's my new gray walking suit, just curl<br/>up the feather in my hat, Beth, then my poplin for Sunday and the<br/>small party, it looks heavy for spring, doesn't it? The violet silk<br/>would be so nice. Oh, dear!"<br/><br/>"Never mind, you've got the tarlaton for the big party, and you<br/>always look like an angel in white," said Amy, brooding over the<br/>little store of finery in which her soul delighted.<br/><br/>"It isn't low-necked, and it doesn't sweep enough, but it will<br/>have to do. My blue housedress looks so well, turned and freshly<br/>trimmed, that I feel as if I'd got a new one. My silk sacque isn't<br/>a bit the fashion, and my bonnet doesn't look like Sallie's. I<br/>didn't like to say anything, but I was sadly disappointed in my<br/>umbrella. I told Mother black with a white handle, but she forgot<br/>and bought a green one with a yellowish handle. It's strong and<br/>neat, so I ought not to complain, but I know I shall feel ashamed<br/>of it beside Annie's silk one with a gold top," sighed Meg,<br/>surveying the little umbrella with great disfavor.<br/><br/>"Change it," advised Jo.<br/><br/>"I won't be so silly, or hurt Marmee's feelings, when she took<br/>so much pains to get my things. It's a nonsensical notion of mine,<br/>and I'm not going to give up to it. My silk stockings and two pairs<br/>of new gloves are my comfort. You are a dear to lend me yours, Jo.<br/>I feel so rich and sort of elegant, with two new pairs, and the old<br/>ones cleaned up for common." And Meg took a refreshing peep at her<br/>glove box.<br/><br/>"Annie Moffat has blue and pink bows on her nightcaps. Would you<br/>put some on mine?" she asked, as Beth brought up a pile of snowy<br/>muslins, fresh from Hannah's hands.<br/><br/>"No, I wouldn't, for the smart caps won't match the plain gowns<br/>without any trimming on them. Poor folks shouldn't rig," said Jo<br/>decidedly.<br/><br/>"I wonder if I shall ever be happy enough to have real lace on<br/>my clothes and bows on my caps?" said Meg impatiently.<br/><br/>
