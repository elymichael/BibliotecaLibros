Estelle Valnor, Theodore Laurence.<br/><br/><br/>The last name was written in pencil, and Amy explained that he<br/>was to rewrite it in ink and seal it up for her properly.<br/><br/>"What put it into your head? Did anyone tell you about Beth's<br/>giving away her things?" asked Laurie soberly, as Amy laid a bit of<br/>red tape, with sealing wax, a taper, and a standish before him.<br/><br/>She explained and then asked anxiously, "What about Beth?"<br/><br/>"I'm sorry I spoke, but as I did, I'll tell you. She felt so ill<br/>one day that she told Jo she wanted to give her piano to Meg, her<br/>cats to you, and the poor old doll to Jo, who would love it for her<br/>sake. She was sorry she had so little to give, and left locks of<br/>hair to the rest of us, and her best love to Grandpa. She never<br/>thought of a will."<br/><br/>Laurie was signing and sealing as he spoke, and did not look up<br/>till a great tear dropped on the paper. Amy's face was full of<br/>trouble, but she only said, "Don't people put sort of postscripts<br/>to their wills, sometimes?"<br/><br/>"Yes, 'codicils', they call them."<br/><br/>"Put one in mine then, that I wish all my curls cut off, and<br/>given round to my friends. I forgot it, but I want it done though<br/>it will spoil my looks."<br/><br/>Laurie added it, smiling at Amy's last and greatest sacrifice.<br/>Then he amused her for an hour, and was much interested in all her<br/>trials. But when he came to go, Amy held him back to whisper with<br/>trembling lips, "Is there really any danger about Beth?"<br/><br/>"I'm afraid there is, but we must hope for the best, so don't<br/>cry, dear." And Laurie put his arm about her with a brotherly<br/>gesture which was very comforting.<br/><br/>
