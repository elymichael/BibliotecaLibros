With what Meg called 'a great want of manners' Jo had saved some<br/>bonbons for the little girls, and they soon subsided, after hearing<br/>the most thrilling events of the evening.<br/><br/>"I declare, it really seems like being a fine young lady, to<br/>come home from the party in a carriage and sit in my dressing gown<br/>with a maid to wait on me," said Meg, as Jo bound up her foot with<br/>arnica and brushed her hair.<br/><br/>"I don't believe fine young ladies enjoy themselves a bit more<br/>than we do, in spite of our burned hair, old gowns, one glove<br/>apiece and tight slippers that sprain our ankles when we are silly<br/>enough to wear them." And I think Jo was quite right.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
