I'll be quiet and go to sleep,<br/>indeed I will."<br/><br/>Jo obeyed, but as her hand went softly to and fro across Beth's<br/>hot forehead and wet eyelids, her heart was very full and she<br/>longed to speak. But young as she was, Jo had learned that hearts,<br/>like flowers, cannot be rudely handled, but must open naturally, so<br/>though she believed she knew the cause of Beth's new pain, she only<br/>said, in her tenderest tone, "Does anything trouble you,<br/>deary?"<br/><br/>"Yes, Jo," after a long pause.<br/><br/>"Wouldn't it comfort you to tell me what it is?"<br/><br/>"Not now, not yet."<br/><br/>"Then I won't ask, but remember, Bethy, that Mother and Jo are<br/>always glad to hear and help you, if they can."<br/><br/>
