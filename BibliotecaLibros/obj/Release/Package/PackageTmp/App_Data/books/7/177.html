The busy mind has no time to think<br/>Of sorrow or care or gloom.<br/>And anxious thoughts may be swept away,<br/>As we bravely wield a broom.<br/><br/>I am glad a task to me is given,<br/>To labor at day by day,<br/>For it brings me health and strength and hope,<br/>And I cheerfully learn to say,<br/>"Head, you may think, Heart, you may feel,<br/>But, Hand, you shall work alway!"<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Dear Mother,<br/><br/>There is only room for me to send my love, and<br/>some pressed pansies from the root I have been keeping safe in the<br/>house for Father to see. I read every morning, try to be good all<br/>day, and sing myself to sleep with Father's tune. I can't sing<br/>'LAND OF THE LEAL' now, it makes me cry. Everyone is very kind, and<br/>we are as happy as we can be without you. Amy wants the rest of the<br/>page, so I must stop. I didn't forget to cover the holders, and I<br/>wind the clock and air the rooms every day.<br/><br/>Kiss dear Father on the cheek he calls mine. Oh,<br/>do come soon to your lovingâ€¦<br/><br/>LITTLE BETH<br/>
