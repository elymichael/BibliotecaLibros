ANNIVERSARY ODE<br/><br/>Again we meet to celebrate<br/>With badge and solemn rite,<br/>Our fifty-second anniversary,<br/>In Pickwick Hall, tonight.<br/><br/>We all are here in perfect health,<br/>None gone from our small band:<br/>Again we see each well-known face,<br/>And press each friendly hand.<br/><br/>Our Pickwick, always at his post,<br/>With reverence we greet,<br/>As, spectacles on nose, he reads<br/>Our well-filled weekly sheet.<br/><br/>Although he suffers from a cold,<br/>We joy to hear him speak,<br/>For words of wisdom from him fall,<br/>In spite of croak or squeak.<br/>
