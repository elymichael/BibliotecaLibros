"Dear me, how romantic!" exclaimed Meg.

"How silly!" said Jo. "Let him be a musician if he wants to, and
not plague his life out sending him to college, when he hates to
go."

"That's why he has such handsome black eyes and pretty manners,
I suppose. Italians are always nice," said Meg, who was a little
sentimental.

"What do you know about his eyes and his manners? You never
spoke to him, hardly," cried Jo, who was not sentimental.

"I saw him at the party, and what you tell shows that he knows
how to behave. That was a nice little speech about the medicine
Mother sent him."

"He meant the blanc mange, I suppose."

"How stupid you are, child! He meant you, of course."

"Did he?" And Jo opened her eyes as if it had never occurred to
her before.

"I never saw such a girl! You don't know a compliment when you
get it," said Meg, with the air of a young lady who knew all about
the matter.

"I think they are great nonsense, and I'll thank you not to be
silly and spoil my fun. Laurie's a nice boy and I like him, and I
won't have any sentimental stuff about compliments and such
rubbish. We'll all be good to him because he hasn't got any mother,
and he may come over and see us, mayn't he, Marmee?"

"Yes, Jo, your little friend is very welcome, and I hope Meg
will remember that children should be children as long as they
can."
