Nobody<br/>will want me, and it's a mercy, for there should always be one old<br/>maid in a family."<br/><br/>"You won't give anyone a chance," said Laurie, with a sidelong<br/>glance and a little more color than before in his sunburned face.<br/>"You won't show the soft side of your character, and if a fellow<br/>gets a peep at it by accident and can't help showing that he likes<br/>it, you treat him as Mrs. Gummidge did her sweetheart, throw cold<br/>water over him, and get so thorny no one dares touch or look at<br/>you."<br/><br/>"I don't like that sort of thing. I'm too busy to be worried<br/>with nonsense, and I think it's dreadful to break up families so.<br/>Now don't say any more about it. Meg's wedding has turned all our<br/>heads, and we talk of nothing but lovers and such absurdities. I<br/>don't wish to get cross, so let's change the subject;" and Jo<br/>looked quite ready to fling cold water on the slightest<br/>provocation.<br/><br/>Whatever his feelings might have been, Laurie found a vent for<br/>them in a long low whistle and the fearful prediction as they<br/>parted at the gate, "Mark my words, Jo, you'll go next."<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
