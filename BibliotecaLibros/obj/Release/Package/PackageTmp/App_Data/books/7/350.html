<br/>"Not from you, it doesn't sound natural, and I like your old<br/>bluntness better."<br/><br/>"I'm glad of it," he answered, with a look of relief, then<br/>buttoned her gloves for her, and asked if his tie was straight,<br/>just as he used to do when they went to parties together at<br/>home.<br/><br/>The company assembled in the long salle a manger, that evening,<br/>was such as one sees nowhere but on the Continent. The hospitable<br/>Americans had invited every acquaintance they had in Nice, and<br/>having no prejudice against titles, secured a few to add luster to<br/>their Christmas ball.<br/><br/>A Russian prince condescended to sit in a corner for an hour and<br/>talk with a massive lady, dressed like Hamlet's mother in black<br/>velvet with a pearl bridle under her chin. A Polish count, aged<br/>eighteen, devoted himself to the ladies, who pronounced him, 'a<br/>fascinating dear', and a German Serene Something, having come to<br/>supper alone, roamed vaguely about, seeking what he might devour.<br/>Baron Rothschild's private secretary, a large-nosed Jew in tight<br/>boots, affably beamed upon the world, as if his master's name<br/>crowned him with a golden halo. A stout Frenchman, who knew the<br/>Emperor, came to indulge his mania for dancing, and Lady de Jones,<br/>a British matron, adorned the scene with her little family of<br/>eight. Of course, there were many light-footed, shrill-voiced<br/>American girls, handsome, lifeless-looking English ditto, and a few<br/>plain but piquante French demoiselles, likewise the usual set of<br/>traveling young gentlemen who disported themselves gaily, while<br/>mammas of all nations lined the walls and smiled upon them benignly<br/>when they danced with their daughters.<br/><br/>Any young girl can imagine Amy's state of mind when she 'took<br/>the stage' that night, leaning on Laurie's arm. She knew she looked<br/>well, she loved to dance, she felt that her foot was on her native<br/>heath in a ballroom, and enjoyed the delightful sense of power<br/>which comes when young girls first discover the new and lovely<br/>kingdom they are born to rule by virtue of beauty, youth, and<br/>womanhood. She did pity the Davis girls, who were awkward, plain,<br/>and destitute of escort, except a grim papa and three grimmer<br/>maiden aunts, and she bowed to them in her friendliest manner as<br/>she passed, which was good of her, as it permitted them to see her<br/>dress, and burn with curiosity to know who her<br/>distinguished-looking friend might be. With the first burst of the<br/>band, Amy's color rose, her eyes began to sparkle, and her feet to<br/>tap the floor impatiently, for she danced well and wanted Laurie to<br/>know it. Therefore the shock she received can better be imagined<br/>than described, when he said in a perfectly tranquil tone, "Do you<br/>care to dance?"<br/><br/>"One usually does at a ball."<br/><br/>Her amazed look and quick answer caused Laurie to repair his<br/>error as fast as possible.<br/><br/>"I meant the first dance. May I have the honor?"<br/><br/>"I can give you one if I put off the Count. He dances devinely,<br/>but he will excuse me, as you are an old friend," said Amy, hoping<br/>that the name would have a good effect, and show Laurie that she<br/>was not to be trifled with.<br/><br/>"Nice little boy, but rather a short Pole to supportâ€¦<br/><br/>
