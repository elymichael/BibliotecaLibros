<br/>A loud response from Snodgrass, followed, to everybody's<br/>surprise, by a timid one from Beth.<br/><br/>"Contrary-minded say, 'No'."<br/><br/>Meg and Amy were contrary-minded, and Mr. Winkle rose to say<br/>with great elegance, "We don't wish any boys, they only joke and<br/>bounce about. This is a ladies' club, and we wish to be private and<br/>proper."<br/><br/>"I'm afraid he'll laugh at our paper, and make fun of us<br/>afterward," observed Pickwick, pulling the little curl on her<br/>forehead, as she always did when doubtful.<br/><br/>Up rose Snodgrass, very much in earnest. "Sir, I give you my<br/>word as a gentleman, Laurie won't do anything of the sort. He likes<br/>to write, and he'll give a tone to our contributions and keep us<br/>from being sentimental, don't you see? We can do so little for him,<br/>and he does so much for us, I think the least we can do is to offer<br/>him a place here, and make him welcome if he comes."<br/><br/>This artful allusion to benefits conferred brought Tupman to his<br/>feet, looking as if he had quite made up his mind.<br/><br/>"Yes; we ought to do it, even if we are afraid. I say he may<br/>come, and his grandpa, too, if he likes."<br/><br/>This spirited burst from Beth electrified the club, and Jo left<br/>her seat to shake hands approvingly. "Now then, vote again.<br/>Everybody remember it's our Laurie, and say, 'Aye!'" cried<br/>Snodgrass excitedly.<br/><br/>"Aye! Aye! Aye!" replied three voices at once.<br/><br/>"Good! Bless you! Now, as there's nothing like 'taking time by<br/>the fetlock', as Winkle characteristically observes, allow me to<br/>present the new member." And, to the dismay of the rest of the<br/>club, Jo threw open the door of the closet, and displayed Laurie<br/>sitting on a rag bag, flushed and twinkling with suppressed<br/>laughter.<br/><br/>
