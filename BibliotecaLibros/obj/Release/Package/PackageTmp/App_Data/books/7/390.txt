"You thoughtful creeter, you're determined we shan't miss that
dear lamb ef you can help it. We don't say much, but we see it, and
the Lord will bless you for't, see ef He don't."

As they sat sewing together, Jo discovered how much improved her
sister Meg was, how well she could talk, how much she knew about
good, womanly impulses, thoughts, and feelings, how happy she was
in husband and children, and how much they were all doing for each
other.

"Marriage is an excellent thing, after all. I wonder if I should
blossom out half as well as you have, if I tried it?,
always&#160;
'perwisin'
&#160;I could," said Jo, as she
constructed a kite for Demi in the topsy-turvy nursery.

"It's just what you need to bring out the tender womanly half of
your nature, Jo. You are like a chestnut burr, prickly outside, but
silky-soft within, and a sweet kernal, if one can only get at it.
Love will make you show your heart one day, and then the rough burr
will fall off."

"Frost opens chestnut burrs, ma'am, and it takes a good shake to
bring them down. Boys go nutting, and I don't care to be bagged by
them," returned Jo, pasting away at the kite which no wind that
blows would ever carry up, for Daisy had tied herself on as a
bob.

Meg laughed, for she was glad to see a glimmer of Jo's old
spirit, but she felt it her duty to enforce her opinion by every
argument in her power, and the sisterly chats were not wasted,
especially as two of Meg's most effective arguments were the
babies, whom Jo loved tenderly. Grief is the best opener of some
hearts, and Jo's was nearly ready for the bag. A little more
sunshine to ripen the nut, then, not a boy's impatient shake, but a
man's hand reached up to pick it gently from the burr, and find the
kernal sound and sweet. If she suspected this, she would have shut
up tight, and been more prickly than ever, fortunately she wasn't
thinking about herself, so when the time came, down she
dropped.

Now, if she had been the heroine of a moral storybook, she ought
at this period of her life to have become quite saintly, renounced
the world, and gone about doing good in a mortified bonnet, with
tracts in her pocket. But, you see, Jo wasn't a heroine, she was
only a struggling human girl like hundreds of others, and she just
acted out her nature, being sad, cross, listless, or energetic, as
the mood suggested. It's highly virtuous to say we'll be good, but
we can't do it all at once, and it takes a long pull, a strong
pull, and a pull all together before some of us even get our feet
set in the right way. Jo had got so far, she was learning to do her
duty, and to feel unhappy if she did not, but to do it cheerfully,
ah, that was another thing! She had often said she wanted to do
something splendid, no matter how hard, and now she had her wish,
for what could be more beautiful than to devote her life to Father
and Mother, trying to make home as happy to them as they had to
her? And if difficulties were necessary to increase the splendor of
the effort, what could be harder for a restless, ambitious girl
than to give up her own hopes, plans, and desires, and cheerfully
live for others?

Providence had taken her at her word. Here was the task, not
what she had expected, but better because self had no part in it.
Now, could she do it? She decided that she would try, and in her
first attempt she found the helps I have suggested. Still another
was given her, and she took it, not as a reward, but as a comfort,
as Christian took the refreshment afforded by the little arbor
where he rested, as he climbed the hill called Difficulty.

"Why don't you write? That always used to make you happy," said
her mother once, when the desponding fit over-shadowed Jo.
