<br/>"Not a first attempt, I take it?" observing that the pages were<br/>numbered, covered only on one side, and not tied up with a<br/>ribbon—sure sign of a novice.<br/><br/>"No, sir. She has had some experience, and got a prize for a<br/>tale in the&#160;<br/>Blarneystone Banner<br/>."<br/><br/>"Oh, did she?" and Mr. Dashwood gave Jo a quick look, which<br/>seemed to take note of everything she had on, from the bow in her<br/>bonnet to the buttons on her boots. "Well, you can leave it, if you<br/>like. We've more of this sort of thing on hand than we know what to<br/>do with at present, but I'll run my eye over it, and give you an<br/>answer next week."<br/><br/>Now, Jo did&#160;<br/>not<br/>&#160;like to leave it, for Mr.<br/>Dashwood didn't suit her at all, but, under the circumstances,<br/>there was nothing for her to do but bow and walk away, looking<br/>particularly tall and dignified, as she was apt to do when nettled<br/>or abashed. Just then she was both, for it was perfectly evident<br/>from the knowing glances exchanged among the gentlemen that her<br/>little fiction of 'my friend' was considered a good joke, and a<br/>laugh, produced by some inaudible remark of the editor, as he<br/>closed the door, completed her discomfiture. Half resolving never<br/>to return, she went home, and worked off her irritation by<br/>stitching pinafores vigorously, and in an hour or two was cool<br/>enough to laugh over the scene and long for next week.<br/><br/>When she went again, Mr. Dashwood was alone, whereat she<br/>rejoiced. Mr. Dashwood was much wider awake than before, which was<br/>agreeable, and Mr. Dashwood was not too deeply absorbed in a cigar<br/>to remember his manners, so the second interview was much more<br/>comfortable than the first.<br/><br/>"We'll take this (editors never say I), if you don't object to a<br/>few alterations. It's too long, but omitting the passages I've<br/>marked will make it just the right length," he said, in a<br/>businesslike tone.<br/><br/>Jo hardly knew her own MS. again, so crumpled and underscored<br/>were its pages and paragraphs, but feeling as a tender parent might<br/>on being asked to cut off her baby's legs in order that it might<br/>fit into a new cradle, she looked at the marked passages and was<br/>surprised to find that all the moral reflections—which she had<br/>carefully put in as ballast for much romance—had been stricken<br/>out.<br/><br/>"But, Sir, I thought every story should have some sort of a<br/>moral, so I took care to have a few of my sinners repent."<br/><br/>
