Beth started, leaned forward, smiled and nodded, watched the<br/>passer-by till his quick tramp died away, then said softly as if to<br/>herself, "How strong and well and happy that dear boy looks."<br/><br/>"Hum!" said Jo, still intent upon her sister's face, for the<br/>bright color faded as quickly as it came, the smile vanished, and<br/>presently a tear lay shining on the window ledge. Beth whisked it<br/>off, and in her half-averted face read a tender sorrow that made<br/>her own eyes fill. Fearing to betray herself, she slipped away,<br/>murmuring something about needing more paper.<br/><br/>"Mercy on me, Beth loves Laurie!" she said, sitting down in her<br/>own room, pale with the shock of the discovery which she believed<br/>she had just made. "I never dreamed of such a thing. What will<br/>Mother say? I wonder if her… " there Jo stopped and turned scarlet<br/>with a sudden thought. "If he shouldn't love back again, how<br/>dreadful it would be. He must. I'll make him!" and she shook her<br/>head threateningly at the picture of the mischievous-looking boy<br/>laughing at her from the wall. "Oh dear, we are growing up with a<br/>vengeance. Here's Meg married and a mamma, Amy flourishing away at<br/>Paris, and Beth in love. I'm the only one that has sense enough to<br/>keep out of mischief." Jo thought intently for a minute with her<br/>eyes fixed on the picture, then she smoothed out her wrinkled<br/>forehead and said, with a decided nod at the face opposite, "No<br/>thank you, sir, you're very charming, but you've no more stability<br/>than a weathercock. So you needn't write touching notes and smile<br/>in that insinuating way, for it won't do a bit of good, and I won't<br/>have it."<br/><br/>Then she sighed, and fell into a reverie from which she did not<br/>wake till the early twilight sent her down to take new<br/>observations, which only confirmed her suspicion. Though Laurie<br/>flirted with Amy and joked with Jo, his manner to Beth had always<br/>been peculiarly kind and gentle, but so was everybody's. Therefore,<br/>no one thought of imagining that he cared more for her than for the<br/>others. Indeed, a general impression had prevailed in the family of<br/>late that 'our boy' was getting fonder than ever of Jo, who,<br/>however, wouldn't hear a word upon the subject and scolded<br/>violently if anyone dared to suggest it. If they had known the<br/>various tender passages which had been nipped in the bud, they<br/>would have had the immense satisfaction of saying, "I told you so."<br/>But Jo hated 'philandering', and wouldn't allow it, always having a<br/>joke or a smile ready at the least sign of impending danger.<br/><br/>When Laurie first went to college, he fell in love about once a<br/>month, but these small flames were as brief as ardent, did no<br/>damage, and much amused Jo, who took great interest in the<br/>alternations of hope, despair, and resignation, which were confided<br/>to her in their weekly conferences. But there came a time when<br/>Laurie ceased to worship at many shrines, hinted darkly at one<br/>all-absorbing passion, and indulged occasionally in Byronic fits of<br/>gloom. Then he avoided the tender subject altogether, wrote<br/>philosophical notes to Jo, turned studious, and gave out that he<br/>was going to 'dig', intending to graduate in a blaze of glory. This<br/>suited the young lady better than twilight confidences, tender<br/>pressures of the hand, and eloquent glances of the eye, for with<br/>Jo, brain developed earlier than heart, and she preferred imaginary<br/>heroes to real ones, because when tired of them, the former could<br/>be shut up in the tin kitchen till called for, and the latter were<br/>less manageable.<br/><br/>Things were in this state when the grand discovery was made, and<br/>Jo watched Laurie that night as she had never done before. If she<br/>had not got the new idea into her head, she would have seen nothing<br/>unusual in the fact that Beth was very quiet, and Laurie very kind<br/>to her. But having given the rein to her lively fancy, it galloped<br/>away with her at a great pace, and common sense, being rather<br/>weakened by a long course of romance writing, did not come to the<br/>rescue. As usual Beth lay on the sofa and Laurie sat in a low chair<br/>close by, amusing her with all sorts of gossip, for she depended on<br/>her weekly 'spin', and he never disappointed her. But that evening<br/>Jo fancied that Beth's eyes rested on the lively, dark face beside<br/>her with peculiar pleasure, and that she listened with intense<br/>interest to an account of some exciting cricket match, though the<br/>phrases, 'caught off a tice', 'stumped off his ground', and 'the<br/>leg hit for three', were as intelligible to her as Sanskrit. She<br/>also fancied, having set her heart upon seeing it, that she saw a<br/>certain increase of gentleness in Laurie's manner, that he dropped<br/>his voice now and then, laughed less than usual, was a little<br/>absent-minded, and settled the afghan over Beth's feet with an<br/>assiduity that was really almost tender.<br/><br/>"Who knows? Stranger things have happened," thought Jo, as she<br/>fussed about the room. "She will make quite an angel of him, and he<br/>will make life delightfully easy and pleasant for the dear, if they<br/>only love each other. I don't see how he can help it, and I do<br/>believe he would if the rest of us were out of the way."<br/><br/>As everyone was out of the way but herself, Jo began to feel<br/>that she ought to dispose of herself with all speed. But where<br/>should she go? And burning to lay herself upon the shrine of<br/>sisterly devotion, she sat down to settle that point.<br/><br/>Now, the old sofa was a regular patriarch of a sofa—long, broad,<br/>well-cushioned, and low, a trifle shabby, as well it might be, for<br/>the girls had slept and sprawled on it as babies, fished over the<br/>back, rode on the arms, and had menageries under it as children,<br/>and rested tired heads, dreamed dreams, and listened to tender talk<br/>on it as young women. They all loved it, for it was a family<br/>refuge, and one corner had always been Jo's favorite lounging<br/>place. Among the many pillows that adorned the venerable couch was<br/>one, hard, round, covered with prickly horsehair, and furnished<br/>with a knobby button at each end. This repulsive pillow was her<br/>especial property, being used as a weapon of defense, a barricade,<br/>or a stern preventive of too much slumber.<br/><br/>Laurie knew this pillow well, and had cause to regard it with<br/>deep aversion, having been unmercifully pummeled with it in former<br/>days when romping was allowed, and now frequently debarred by it<br/>from the seat he most coveted next to Jo in the sofa corner. If<br/>'the sausage' as they called it, stood on end, it was a sign that<br/>he might approach and repose, but if it lay flat across the sofa,<br/>woe to man, woman, or child who dared disturb it! That evening Jo<br/>forgot to barricade her corner, and had not been in her seat five<br/>minutes, before a massive form appeared beside her, and with both<br/>arms spread over the sofa back, both long legs stretched out before<br/>him, Laurie exclaimed, with a sigh of satisfaction…<br/><br/>"Now, this is filling at the price."<br/>
