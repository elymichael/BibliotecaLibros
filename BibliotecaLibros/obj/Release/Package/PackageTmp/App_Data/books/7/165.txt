At the word 'telegraph', Mrs. March snatched it, read the two
lines it contained, and dropped back into her chair as white as if
the little paper had sent a bullet to her heart. Laurie dashed
downstairs for water, while Meg and Hannah supported her, and Jo
read aloud, in a frightened voiceâ€¦


Mrs. March:
Your husband is very ill. Come at once.
S. HALE
Blank Hospital, Washington.


How still the room was as they listened breathlessly, how
strangely the day darkened outside, and how suddenly the whole
world seemed to change, as the girls gathered about their mother,
feeling as if all the happiness and support of their lives was
about to be taken from them.

Mrs. March was herself again directly, read the message over,
and stretched out her arms to her daughters, saying, in a tone they
never forgot, "I shall go at once, but it may be too late. Oh,
children, children, help me to bear it!"

For several minutes there was nothing but the sound of sobbing
in the room, mingled with broken words of comfort, tender
assurances of help, and hopeful whispers that died away in tears.
Poor Hannah was the first to recover, and with unconscious wisdom
she set all the rest a good example, for with her, work was panacea
for most afflictions.

"The Lord keep the dear man! I won't waste no time a-cryin', but
git your things ready right away, mum," she said heartily, as she
wiped her face on her apron, gave her mistress a warm shake of the
hand with her own hard one, and went away to work like three women
in one.

"She's right, there's no time for tears now. Be calm, girls, and
let me think."

They tried to be calm, poor things, as their mother sat up,
looking pale but steady, and put away her grief to think and plan
for them.
