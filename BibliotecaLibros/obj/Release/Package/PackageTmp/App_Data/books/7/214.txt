"Pooh! You're a girl, and it's fun, but I'll allow no man to
shake me!"

"I don't think anyone would care to try it, if you looked as
much like a thundercloud as you do now. Why were you treated
so?"

"Just because I wouldn't say what your mother wanted me for. I'd
promised not to tell, and of course I wasn't going to break my
word."

"Couldn't you satisfy your grandpa in any other way?"

"No, he would have the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but
the truth. I'd have told my part of the scrape, if I could without
bringing Meg in. As I couldn't, I held my tongue, and bore the
scolding till the old gentleman collared me. Then I bolted, for
fear I should forget myself."

"It wasn't nice, but he's sorry, I know, so go down and make up.
I'll help you."

"Hanged if I do! I'm not going to be lectured and pummelled by
everyone, just for a bit of a frolic. I was sorry about Meg, and
begged pardon like a man, but I won't do it again, when I wasn't in
the wrong."

"He didn't know that."

"He ought to trust me, and not act as if I was a baby. It's no
use, Jo, he's got to learn that I'm able to take care of myself,
and don't need anyone's apron string to hold on by."

"What pepper pots you are!" sighed Jo. "How do you mean to
settle this affair?"

"Well, he ought to beg pardon, and believe me when I say I can't
tell him what the fuss's about."
