<br/>How Beth laughed when she saw it, how Laurie ran up and down to<br/>bring in the gifts, and what ridiculous speeches Jo made as she<br/>presented them.<br/><br/>"I'm so full of happiness, that if Father was only here, I<br/>couldn't hold one drop more," said Beth, quite sighing with<br/>contentment as Jo carried her off to the study to rest after the<br/>excitement, and to refresh herself with some of the delicious<br/>grapes the 'Jungfrau' had sent her.<br/><br/>"So am I," added Jo, slapping the pocket wherein reposed the<br/>long-desired&#160;<br/>Undine and Sintram<br/>.<br/><br/>"I'm sure I am," echoed Amy, poring over the engraved copy of<br/>the Madonna and Child, which her mother had given her in a pretty<br/>frame.<br/><br/>"Of course I am!" cried Meg, smoothing the silvery folds of her<br/>first silk dress, for Mr. Laurence had insisted on giving it. "How<br/>can I be otherwise?" said Mrs. March gratefully, as her eyes went<br/>from her husband's letter to Beth's smiling face, and her hand<br/>carressed the brooch made of gray and golden, chestnut and dark<br/>brown hair, which the girls had just fastened on her breast.<br/><br/>Now and then, in this workaday world, things do happen in the<br/>delightful storybook fashion, and what a comfort it is. Half an<br/>hour after everyone had said they were so happy they could only<br/>hold one drop more, the drop came. Laurie opened the parlor door<br/>and popped his head in very quietly. He might just as well have<br/>turned a somersault and uttered an Indian war whoop, for his face<br/>was so full of suppressed excitement and his voice so treacherously<br/>joyful that everyone jumped up, though he only said, in a queer,<br/>breathless voice, "Here's another Christmas present for the March<br/>family."<br/><br/>Before the words were well out of his mouth, he was whisked away<br/>somehow, and in his place appeared a tall man, muffled up to the<br/>eyes, leaning on the arm of another tall man, who tried to say<br/>something and couldn't. Of course there was a general stampede, and<br/>for several minutes everybody seemed to lose their wits, for the<br/>strangest things were done, and no one said a word.<br/><br/>Mr. March became invisible in the embrace of four pairs of<br/>loving arms. Jo disgraced herself by nearly fainting away, and had<br/>to be doctored by Laurie in the china closet. Mr. Brooke kissed Meg<br/>entirely by mistake, as he somewhat incoherently explained. And<br/>Amy, the dignified, tumbled over a stool, and never stopping to get<br/>up, hugged and cried over her father's boots in the most touching<br/>manner. Mrs. March was the first to recover herself, and held up<br/>her hand with a warning, "Hush! Remember Beth."<br/><br/>But it was too late. The study door flew open, the little red<br/>wrapper appeared on the threshold, joy put strength into the feeble<br/>limbs, and Beth ran straight into her father's arms. Never mind<br/>what happened just after that, for the full hearts overflowed,<br/>washing away the bitterness of the past and leaving only the<br/>sweetness of the present.<br/><br/>
