"I only said I thought so."

"But you like me in spite of it?"

"Yes, I do, sir."

That answer pleased the old gentleman. He gave a short laugh,
shook hands with her, and, putting his finger under her chin,
turned up her face, examined it gravely, and let it go, saying with
a nod, "You've got your grandfather's spirit, if you haven't his
face. He was a fine man, my dear, but what is better, he was a
brave and an honest one, and I was proud to be his friend."

"Thank you, sir," And Jo was quite comfortable after that, for
it suited her exactly.

"What have you been doing to this boy of mine, hey?" was the
next question, sharply put.

"Only trying to be neighborly, sir." And Jo told how her visit
came about.

"You think he needs cheering up a bit, do you?"

"Yes, sir, he seems a little lonely, and young folks would do
him good perhaps. We are only girls, but we should be glad to help
if we could, for we don't forget the splendid Christmas present you
sent us," said Jo eagerly.

"Tut, tut, tut! That was the boy's affair. How is the poor
woman?"

"Doing nicely, sir." And off went Jo, talking very fast, as she
told all about the Hummels, in whom her mother had interested
richer friends than they were.
