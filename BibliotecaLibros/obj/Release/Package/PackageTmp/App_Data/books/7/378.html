<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>17<br/>The Valley of the Shadow<br/><br/><br/>When the first bitterness was over, the family accepted the<br/>inevitable, and tried to bear it cheerfully, helping one another by<br/>the increased affection which comes to bind households tenderly<br/>together in times of trouble. They put away their grief, and each<br/>did his or her part toward making that last year a happy one.<br/><br/>The pleasantest room in the house was set apart for Beth, and in<br/>it was gathered everything that she most loved, flowers, pictures,<br/>her piano, the little worktable, and the beloved pussies. Father's<br/>best books found their way there, Mother's easy chair, Jo's desk,<br/>Amy's finest sketches, and every day Meg brought her babies on a<br/>loving pilgrimage, to make sunshine for Aunty Beth. John quietly<br/>set apart a little sum, that he might enjoy the pleasure of keeping<br/>the invalid supplied with the fruit she loved and longed for. Old<br/>Hannah never wearied of concocting dainty dishes to tempt a<br/>capricious appetite, dropping tears as she worked, and from across<br/>the sea came little gifts and cheerful letters, seeming to bring<br/>breaths of warmth and fragrance from lands that know no winter.<br/><br/>Here, cherished like a household saint in its shrine, sat Beth,<br/>tranquil and busy as ever, for nothing could change the sweet,<br/>unselfish nature, and even while preparing to leave life, she tried<br/>to make it happier for those who should remain behind. The feeble<br/>fingers were never idle, and one of her pleasures was to make<br/>little things for the school children daily passing to and fro, to<br/>drop a pair of mittens from her window for a pair of purple hands,<br/>a needlebook for some small mother of many dolls, penwipers for<br/>young penmen toiling through forests of pothooks, scrapbooks for<br/>picture-loving eyes, and all manner of pleasant devices, till the<br/>reluctant climbers of the ladder of learning found their way strewn<br/>with flowers, as it were, and came to regard the gentle giver as a<br/>sort of fairy godmother, who sat above there, and showered down<br/>gifts miraculously suited to their tastes and needs. If Beth had<br/>wanted any reward, she found it in the bright little faces always<br/>turned up to her window, with nods and smiles, and the droll little<br/>letters which came to her, full of blots and gratitude.<br/><br/>The first few months were very happy ones, and Beth often used<br/>to look round, and say "How beautiful this is!" as they all sat<br/>together in her sunny room, the babies kicking and crowing on the<br/>floor, mother and sisters working near, and father reading, in his<br/>pleasant voice, from the wise old books which seemed rich in good<br/>and comfortable words, as applicable now as when written centuries<br/>ago, a little chapel, where a paternal priest taught his flock the<br/>hard lessons all must learn, trying to show them that hope can<br/>comfort love, and faith make resignation possible. Simple sermons,<br/>that went straight to the souls of those who listened, for the<br/>father's heart was in the minister's religion, and the frequent<br/>falter in the voice gave a double eloquence to the words he spoke<br/>or read.<br/><br/>It was well for all that this peaceful time was given them as<br/>preparation for the sad hours to come, for by-and-by, Beth said the<br/>needle was 'so heavy', and put it down forever. Talking wearied<br/>her, faces troubled her, pain claimed her for its own, and her<br/>tranquil spirit was sorrowfully perturbed by the ills that vexed<br/>her feeble flesh. Ah me! Such heavy days, such long, long nights,<br/>such aching hearts and imploring prayers, when those who loved her<br/>best were forced to see the thin hands stretched out to them<br/>beseechingly, to hear the bitter cry, "Help me, help me!" and to<br/>feel that there was no help. A sad eclipse of the serene soul, a<br/>sharp struggle of the young life with death, but both were<br/>mercifully brief, and then the natural rebellion over, the old<br/>peace returned more beautiful than ever. With the wreck of her<br/>frail body, Beth's soul grew strong, and though she said little,<br/>those about her felt that she was ready, saw that the first pilgrim<br/>called was likewise the fittest, and waited with her on the shore,<br/>trying to see the Shining Ones coming to receive her when she<br/>crossed the river.<br/><br/>Jo never left her for an hour since Beth had said "I feel<br/>stronger when you are here." She slept on a couch in the room,<br/>waking often to renew the fire, to feed, lift, or wait upon the<br/>patient creature who seldom asked for anything, and 'tried not to<br/>be a trouble'. All day she haunted the room, jealous of any other<br/>nurse, and prouder of being chosen then than of any honor her life<br/>ever brought her. Precious and helpful hours to Jo, for now her<br/>heart received the teaching that it needed. Lessons in patience<br/>were so sweetly taught her that she could not fail to learn them,<br/>charity for all, the lovely spirit that can forgive and truly<br/>forget unkindness, the loyalty to duty that makes the hardest easy,<br/>and the sincere faith that fears nothing, but trusts<br/>undoubtingly.<br/><br/>Often when she woke Jo found Beth reading in her well-worn<br/>little book, heard her singing softly, to beguile the sleepless<br/>night, or saw her lean her face upon her hands, while slow tears<br/>dropped through the transparent fingers, and Jo would lie watching<br/>her with thoughts too deep for tears, feeling that Beth, in her<br/>simple, unselfish way, was trying to wean herself from the dear old<br/>life, and fit herself for the life to come, by sacred words of<br/>comfort, quiet prayers, and the music she loved so well.<br/>
