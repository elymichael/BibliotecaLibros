<br/>"Oh, that's the trouble is it? I thought there was something in<br/>the dimple that didn't quite suit you. Not being a dog in the<br/>manger, but the happiest fellow alive, I assure you I can dance at<br/>Jo's wedding with a heart as light as my heels. Do you doubt it, my<br/>darling?"<br/><br/>Amy looked up at him, and was satisfied. Her little jealous fear<br/>vanished forever, and she thanked him, with a face full of love and<br/>confidence.<br/><br/>"I wish we could do something for that capital old Professor.<br/>Couldn't we invent a rich relation, who shall obligingly die out<br/>there in Germany, and leave him a tidy little fortune?" said<br/>Laurie, when they began to pace up and down the long drawing room,<br/>arm in arm, as they were fond of doing, in memory of the chateau<br/>garden.<br/><br/>"Jo would find us out, and spoil it all. She is very proud of<br/>him, just as he is, and said yesterday that she thought poverty was<br/>a beautiful thing."<br/><br/>"Bless her dear heart! She won't think so when she has a<br/>literary husband, and a dozen little professors and professorins to<br/>support. We won't interfere now, but watch our chance, and do them<br/>a good turn in spite of themselves. I owe Jo for a part of my<br/>education, and she believes in people's paying their honest debts,<br/>so I'll get round her in that way."<br/><br/>"How delightful it is to be able to help others, isn't it? That<br/>was always one of my dreams, to have the power of giving freely,<br/>and thanks to you, the dream has come true."<br/><br/>"Ah, we'll do quantities of good, won't we? There's one sort of<br/>poverty that I particularly like to help. Out-and-out beggars get<br/>taken care of, but poor gentle folks fare badly, because they won't<br/>ask, and people don't dare to offer charity. Yet there are a<br/>thousand ways of helping them, if one only knows how to do it so<br/>delicately that it does not offend. I must say, I like to serve a<br/>decayed gentleman better than a blarnerying beggar. I suppose it's<br/>wrong, but I do, though it is harder."<br/><br/>"Because it takes a gentleman to do it," added the other member<br/>of the domestic admiration society.<br/><br/>"Thank you, I'm afraid I don't deserve that pretty compliment.<br/>But I was going to say that while I was dawdling about abroad, I<br/>saw a good many talented young fellows making all sorts of<br/>sacrifices, and enduring real hardships, that they might realize<br/>their dreams. Splendid fellows, some of them, working like heros,<br/>poor and friendless, but so full of courage, patience, and ambition<br/>that I was ashamed of myself, and longed to give them a right good<br/>lift. Those are people whom it's a satisfaction to help, for if<br/>they've got genius, it's an honor to be allowed to serve them, and<br/>not let it be lost or delayed for want of fuel to keep the pot<br/>boiling. If they haven't, it's a pleasure to comfort the poor<br/>souls, and keep them from despair when they find it out."<br/><br/>"Yes, indeed, and there's another class who can't ask, and who<br/>suffer in silence. I know something of it, for I belonged to it<br/>before you made a princess of me, as the king does the beggarmaid<br/>in the old story. Ambitious girls have a hard time, Laurie, and<br/>often have to see youth, health, and precious opportunities go by,<br/>just for want of a little help at the right minute. People have<br/>been very kind to me, and whenever I see girls struggling along, as<br/>we used to do, I want to put out my hand and help them, as I was<br/>helped."<br/><br/>
