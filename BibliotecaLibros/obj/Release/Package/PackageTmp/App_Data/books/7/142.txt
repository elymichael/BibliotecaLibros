"Who cares?" said Jo.

"I guess he'll like it," added Beth.

"Of course I shall! I give you my word I won't laugh. Tell away,
Jo, and don't be afraid."

"The idea of being afraid of you! Well, you see we used to play
Pilgrim's Progress, and we have been going on with it in earnest,
all winter and summer."

"Yes, I know," said Laurie, nodding wisely.

"Who told you?" demanded Jo.

"Spirits."

"No, I did. I wanted to amuse him one night when you were all
away, and he was rather dismal. He did like it, so don't scold,
Jo," said Beth meekly.

"You can't keep a secret. Never mind, it saves trouble now."

"Go on, please," said Laurie, as Jo became absorbed in her work,
looking a trifle displeased.

"Oh, didn't she tell you about this new plan of ours? Well, we
have tried not to waste our holiday, but each has had a task and
worked at it with a will. The vacation is nearly over, the stints
are all done, and we are ever so glad that we didn't dawdle."
