<br/>"It can never be the same again. I've lost my dearest friend,"<br/>sighed Jo.<br/><br/>"You've got me, anyhow. I'm not good for much, I know, but I'll<br/>stand by you, Jo, all the days of my life. Upon my word I will!"<br/>and Laurie meant what he said.<br/><br/>"I know you will, and I'm ever so much obliged. You are always a<br/>great comfort to me, Teddy," returned Jo, gratefully shaking<br/>hands.<br/><br/>"Well, now, don't be dismal, there's a good fellow. It's all<br/>right you see. Meg is happy, Brooke will fly round and get settled<br/>immediately, Grandpa will attend to him, and it will be very jolly<br/>to see Meg in her own little house. We'll have capital times after<br/>she is gone, for I shall be through college before long, and then<br/>we'll go abroad on some nice trip or other. Wouldn't that console<br/>you?"<br/><br/>"I rather think it would, but there's no knowing what may happen<br/>in three years," said Jo thoughtfully.<br/><br/>"That's true. Don't you wish you could take a look forward and<br/>see where we shall all be then? I do," returned Laurie.<br/><br/>"I think not, for I might see something sad, and everyone looks<br/>so happy now, I don't believe they could be much improved." And<br/>Jo's eyes went slowly round the room, brightening as they looked,<br/>for the prospect was a pleasant one.<br/><br/>Father and Mother sat together, quietly reliving the first<br/>chapter of the romance which for them began some twenty years ago.<br/>Amy was drawing the lovers, who sat apart in a beautiful world of<br/>their own, the light of which touched their faces with a grace the<br/>little artist could not copy. Beth lay on her sofa, talking<br/>cheerily with her old friend, who held her little hand as if he<br/>felt that it possessed the power to lead him along the peaceful way<br/>she walked. Jo lounged in her favorite low seat, with the grave<br/>quiet look which best became her, and Laurie, leaning on the back<br/>of her chair, his chin on a level with her curly head, smiled with<br/>his friendliest aspect, and nodded at her in the long glass which<br/>reflected them both.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>So the curtain falls upon Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy. Whether it<br/>ever rises again, depends upon the reception given the first act of<br/>the domestic drama called&#160;<br/>Little Women<br/>
