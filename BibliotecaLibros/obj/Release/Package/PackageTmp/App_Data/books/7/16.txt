"Goodness only knows. Some poor creeter came a-beggin', and your
ma went straight off to see what was needed. There never was such a
woman for givin' away vittles and drink, clothes and firin',"
replied Hannah, who had lived with the family since Meg was born,
and was considered by them all more as a friend than a servant.

"She will be back soon, I think, so fry your cakes, and have
everything ready," said Meg, looking over the presents which were
collected in a basket and kept under the sofa, ready to be produced
at the proper time. "Why, where is Amy's bottle of cologne?" she
added, as the little flask did not appear.

"She took it out a minute ago, and went off with it to put a
ribbon on it, or some such notion," replied Jo, dancing about the
room to take the first stiffness off the new army slippers.

"How nice my handkerchiefs look, don't they? Hannah washed and
ironed them for me, and I marked them all myself," said Beth,
looking proudly at the somewhat uneven letters which had cost her
such labor.

"Bless the child! She's gone and put 'Mother' on them instead of
'M. March'. How funny!" cried Jo, taking one up.

"Isn't that right? I thought it was better to do it so, because
Meg's initials are M.M., and I don't want anyone to use these but
Marmee," said Beth, looking troubled.

"It's all right, dear, and a very pretty idea, quite sensible
too, for no one can ever mistake now. It will please her very much,
I know," said Meg, with a frown for Jo and a smile for Beth.

"There's Mother. Hide the basket, quick!" cried Jo, as a door
slammed and steps sounded in the hall.

Amy came in hastily, and looked rather abashed when she saw her
sisters all waiting for her.

"Where have you been, and what are you hiding behind you?" asked
Meg, surprised to see, by her hood and cloak, that lazy Amy had
been out so early.
