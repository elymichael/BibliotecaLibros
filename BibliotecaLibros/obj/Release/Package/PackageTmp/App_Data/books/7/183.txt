"Don't be frightened, I guess I shan't have it badly. I looked
in Mother's book, and saw that it begins with headache, sore
throat, and queer feelings like mine, so I did take some
belladonna, and I feel better," said Beth, laying her cold hands on
her hot forehead and trying to look well.

"If Mother was only at home!" exclaimed Jo, seizing the book,
and feeling that Washington was an immense way off. She read a
page, looked at Beth, felt her head, peeped into her throat, and
then said gravely, "You've been over the baby every day for more
than a week, and among the others who are going to have it, so I'm
afraid you are going to have it, Beth. I'll call Hannah, she knows
all about sickness."

"Don't let Amy come. She never had it, and I should hate to give
it to her. Can't you and Meg have it over again?" asked Beth,
anxiously.

"I guess not. Don't care if I do. Serve me right, selfish pig,
to let you go, and stay writing rubbish myself!" muttered Jo, as
she went to consult Hannah.

The good soul was wide awake in a minute, and took the lead at
once, assuring that there was no need to worry; every one had
scarlet fever, and if rightly treated, nobody died, all of which Jo
believed, and felt much relieved as they went up to call Meg.

"Now I'll tell you what we'll do," said Hannah, when she had
examined and questioned Beth, "we will have Dr. Bangs, just to take
a look at you, dear, and see that we start right. Then we'll send
Amy off to Aunt March's for a spell, to keep her out of harm's way,
and one of you girls can stay at home and amuse Beth for a day or
two."

"I shall stay, of course, I'm oldest," began Meg, looking
anxious and self-reproachful.

"I shall, because it's my fault she is sick. I told Mother I'd
do the errands, and I haven't," said Jo decidedly.

"Which will you have, Beth? There ain't no need of but one," aid
Hannah.

"Jo, please." And Beth leaned her head against her sister with a
contented look, which effectually settled that point.
