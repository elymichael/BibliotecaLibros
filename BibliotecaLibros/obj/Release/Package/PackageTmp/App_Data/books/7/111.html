<br/>The P. O. was a capital little institution, and flourished<br/>wonderfully, for nearly as many queer things passed through it as<br/>through the real post office. Tragedies and cravats, poetry and<br/>pickles, garden seeds and long letters, music and gingerbread,<br/>rubbers, invitations, scoldings, and puppies. The old gentleman<br/>liked the fun, and amused himself by sending odd bundles,<br/>mysterious messages, and funny telegrams, and his gardener, who was<br/>smitten with Hannah's charms, actually sent a love letter to Jo's<br/>care. How they laughed when the secret came out, never dreaming how<br/>many love letters that little post office would hold in the years<br/>to come.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
