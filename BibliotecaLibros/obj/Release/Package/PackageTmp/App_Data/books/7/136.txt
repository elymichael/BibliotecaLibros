"I have neither, and very few friends to care whether I live or
die," said Mr. Brooke rather bitterly as he absently put the dead
rose in the hole he had made and covered it up, like a little
grave.

"Laurie and his grandfather would care a great deal, and we
should all be very sorry to have any harm happen to you," said Meg
heartily.

"Thank you, that sounds pleasant," began Mr. Brooke, looking
cheerful again, but before he could finish his speech, Ned, mounted
on the old horse, came lumbering up to display his equestrian skill
before the young ladies, and there was no more quiet that day.

"Don't you love to ride?" asked Grace of Amy, as they stood
resting after a race round the field with the others, led by
Ned.

"I dote upon it. My sister, Meg, used to ride when Papa was
rich, but we don't keep any horses now, except Ellen Tree," added
Amy, laughing.

"Tell me about Ellen Tree. Is it a donkey?" asked Grace
curiously.

"Why, you see, Jo is crazy about horses and so am I, but we've
only got an old sidesaddle and no horse. Out in our garden is an
apple tree that has a nice low branch, so Jo put the saddle on it,
fixed some reins on the part that turns up, and we bounce away on
Ellen Tree whenever we like."

"How funny!" laughed Grace. "I have a pony at home, and ride
nearly every day in the park with Fred and Kate. It's very nice,
for my friends go too, and the Row is full of ladies and
gentlemen."

"Dear, how charming! I hope I shall go abroad some day, but I'd
rather go to Rome than the Row," said Amy, who had not the remotest
idea what the Row was and wouldn't have asked for the world.

Frank, sitting just behind the little girls, heard what they
were saying, and pushed his crutch away from him with an impatient
gesture as he watched the active lads going through all sorts of
comical gymnastics. Beth, who was collecting the scattered Author
cards, looked up and said, in her shy yet friendly way, "I'm afraid
you are tired. Can I do anything for you?"
