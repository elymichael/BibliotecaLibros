<br/>"Nothing more, except that I don't believe I shall ever marry.<br/>I'm happy as I am, and love my liberty too well to be in a hurry to<br/>give it up for any mortal man."<br/><br/>"I know better!" broke in Laurie. "You think so now, but<br/>there'll come a time when you will care for somebody, and you'll<br/>love him tremendously, and live and die for him. I know you will,<br/>it's your way, and I shall have to stand by and see it," and the<br/>despairing lover cast his hat upon the ground with a gesture that<br/>would have seemed comical, if his face had not been so tragic.<br/><br/>"Yes, I will live and die for him, if he ever comes and makes me<br/>love him in spite of myself, and you must do the best you can!"<br/>cried Jo, losing patience with poor Teddy. "I've done my best, but<br/>you won't be reasonable, and it's selfish of you to keep teasing<br/>for what I can't give. I shall always be fond of you, very fond<br/>indeed, as a friend, but I'll never marry you, and the sooner you<br/>believe it the better for both of usâ€”so now!"<br/><br/>That speech was like gunpowder. Laurie looked at her a minute as<br/>if he did not quite know what to do with himself, then turned<br/>sharply away, saying in a desperate sort of tone, "You'll be sorry<br/>some day, Jo."<br/><br/>"Oh, where are you going?" she cried, for his face frightened<br/>her.<br/><br/>"To the devil!" was the consoling answer.<br/><br/>For a minute Jo's heart stood still, as he swung himself down<br/>the bank toward the river, but it takes much folly, sin or misery<br/>to send a young man to a violent death, and Laurie was not one of<br/>the weak sort who are conquered by a single failure. He had no<br/>thought of a melodramatic plunge, but some blind instinct led him<br/>to fling hat and coat into his boat, and row away with all his<br/>might, making better time up the river than he had done in any<br/>race. Jo drew a long breath and unclasped her hands as she watched<br/>the poor fellow trying to outstrip the trouble which he carried in<br/>his heart.<br/><br/>"That will do him good, and he'll come home in such a tender,<br/>penitent state of mind, that I shan't dare to see him," she said,<br/>adding, as she went slowly home, feeling as if she had murdered<br/>some innocent thing, and buried it under the leaves. "Now I must go<br/>and prepare Mr. Laurence to be very kind to my poor boy. I wish<br/>he'd love Beth, perhaps he may in time, but I begin to think I was<br/>mistaken about her. Oh dear! How can girls like to have lovers and<br/>refuse them? I think it's dreadful."<br/><br/>Being sure that no one could do it so well as herself, she went<br/>straight to Mr. Laurence, told the hard story bravely through, and<br/>then broke down, crying so dismally over her own insensibility that<br/>the kind old gentleman, though sorely disappointed, did not utter a<br/>reproach. He found it difficult to understand how any girl could<br/>help loving Laurie, and hoped she would change her mind, but he<br/>knew even better than Jo that love cannot be forced, so he shook<br/>his head sadly and resolved to carry his boy out of harm's way, for<br/>Young Impetuosity's parting words to Jo disturbed him more than he<br/>would confess.<br/><br/>When Laurie came home, dead tired but quite composed, his<br/>grandfather met him as if he knew nothing, and kept up the delusion<br/>very successfully for an hour or two. But when they sat together in<br/>the twilight, the time they used to enjoy so much, it was hard work<br/>for the old man to ramble on as usual, and harder still for the<br/>young one to listen to praises of the last year's success, which to<br/>him now seemed like love's labor lost. He bore it as long as he<br/>could, then went to his piano and began to play. The window's were<br/>open, and Jo, walking in the garden with Beth, for once understood<br/>music better than her sister, for he played the '<br/>Sonata<br/>Pathetique<br/>
