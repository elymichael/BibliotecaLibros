Harvest Time


For a year Jo and her Professor worked and waited, hoped and
loved, met occasionally, and wrote such voluminous letters that the
rise in the price of paper was accounted for, Laurie said. The
second year began rather soberly, for their prospects did not
brighten, and Aunt March died suddenly. But when their first sorrow
was over—for they loved the old lady in spite of her sharp
tongue—they found they had cause for rejoicing, for she had left
Plumfield to Jo, which made all sorts of joyful things
possible.

"It's a fine old place, and will bring a handsome sum, for of
course you intend to sell it," said Laurie, as they were all
talking the matter over some weeks later.

"No, I don't," was Jo's decided answer, as she petted the fat
poodle, whom she had adopted, out of respect to his former
mistress.

"You don't mean to live there?"

"Yes, I do."

"But, my dear girl, it's an immense house, and will take a power
of money to keep it in order. The garden and orchard alone need two
or three men, and farming isn't in Bhaer's line, I take it."

"He'll try his hand at it there, if I propose it."
