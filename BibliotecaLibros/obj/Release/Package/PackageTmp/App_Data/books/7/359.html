<br/>"It's that naughty boy. I told him to go to sleep alone, and<br/>here he is, downstairs, getting his death a-cold pattering over<br/>that canvas," said Meg, answering the call.<br/><br/>"Mornin' now," announced Demi in joyful tone as he entered, with<br/>his long nightgown gracefully festooned over his arm and every curl<br/>bobbing gayly as he pranced about the table, eyeing the 'cakies'<br/>with loving glances.<br/><br/>"No, it isn't morning yet. You must go to bed, and not trouble<br/>poor Mamma. Then you can have the little cake with sugar on<br/>it."<br/><br/>"Me loves Parpar," said the artful one, preparing to climb the<br/>paternal knee and revel in forbidden joys. But John shook his head,<br/>and said to Megâ€¦<br/><br/>"If you told him to stay up there, and go to sleep alone, make<br/>him do it, or he will never learn to mind you."<br/><br/>"Yes, of course. Come, Demi," and Meg led her son away, feeling<br/>a strong desire to spank the little marplot who hopped beside her,<br/>laboring under the delusion that the bribe was to be administered<br/>as soon as they reached the nursery.<br/><br/>Nor was he disappointed, for that shortsighted woman actually<br/>gave him a lump of sugar, tucked him into his bed, and forbade any<br/>more promenades till morning.<br/><br/>"Iss!" said Demi the perjured, blissfully sucking his sugar, and<br/>regarding his first attempt as eminently successful.<br/><br/>Meg returned to her place, and supper was progressing<br/>pleasantly, when the little ghost walked again, and exposed the<br/>maternal delinquencies by boldly demanding, "More sudar,<br/>Marmar."<br/><br/>"Now this won't do," said John, hardening his heart against the<br/>engaging little sinner. "We shall never know any peace till that<br/>child learns to go to bed properly. You have made a slave of<br/>yourself long enough. Give him one lesson, and then there will be<br/>an end of it. Put him in his bed and leave him, Meg."<br/><br/>
