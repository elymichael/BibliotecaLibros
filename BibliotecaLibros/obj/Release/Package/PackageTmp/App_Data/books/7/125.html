"Oh, Jo, you are not going to wear that awful hat? It's too<br/>absurd! You shall not make a guy of yourself," remonstrated Meg, as<br/>Jo tied down with a red ribbon the broad-brimmed, old-fashioned<br/>leghorn Laurie had sent for a joke.<br/><br/>"I just will, though, for it's capital, so shady, light, and<br/>big. It will make fun, and I don't mind being a guy if I'm<br/>comfortable." With that Jo marched straight away and the rest<br/>followed, a bright little band of sisters, all looking their best<br/>in summer suits, with happy faces under the jaunty hatbrims.<br/><br/>Laurie ran to meet and present them to his friends in the most<br/>cordial manner. The lawn was the reception room, and for several<br/>minutes a lively scene was enacted there. Meg was grateful to see<br/>that Miss Kate, though twenty, was dressed with a simplicity which<br/>American girls would do well to imitate, and who was much flattered<br/>by Mr. Ned's assurances that he came especially to see her. Jo<br/>understood why Laurie 'primmed up his mouth' when speaking of Kate,<br/>for that young lady had a standoff-don't-touch-me air, which<br/>contrasted strongly with the free and easy demeanor of the other<br/>girls. Beth took an observation of the new boys and decided that<br/>the lame one was not 'dreadful', but gentle and feeble, and she<br/>would be kind to him on that account. Amy found Grace a<br/>well-mannered, merry, little person, and after staring dumbly at<br/>one another for a few minutes, they suddenly became very good<br/>friends.<br/><br/>Tents, lunch, and croquet utensils having been sent on<br/>beforehand, the party was soon embarked, and the two boats pushed<br/>off together, leaving Mr. Laurence waving his hat on the shore.<br/>Laurie and Jo rowed one boat, Mr. Brooke and Ned the other, while<br/>Fred Vaughn, the riotous twin, did his best to upset both by<br/>paddling about in a wherry like a disturbed water bug. Jo's funny<br/>hat deserved a vote of thanks, for it was of general utility. It<br/>broke the ice in the beginning by producing a laugh, it created<br/>quite a refreshing breeze, flapping to and fro as she rowed, and<br/>would make an excellent umbrella for the whole party, if a shower<br/>came up, she said. Miss Kate decided that she was 'odd', but rather<br/>clever, and smiled upon her from afar.<br/><br/>Meg, in the other boat, was delightfully situated, face to face<br/>with the rowers, who both admired the prospect and feathered their<br/>oars with uncommon 'skill and dexterity'. Mr. Brooke was a grave,<br/>silent young man, with handsome brown eyes and a pleasant voice.<br/>Meg liked his quiet manners and considered him a walking<br/>encyclopedia of useful knowledge. He never talked to her much, but<br/>he looked at her a good deal, and she felt sure that he did not<br/>regard her with aversion. Ned, being in college, of course put on<br/>all the airs which freshmen think it their bounden duty to assume.<br/>He was not very wise, but very good-natured, and altogether an<br/>excellent person to carry on a picnic. Sallie Gardiner was absorbed<br/>in keeping her white pique dress clean and chattering with the<br/>ubiquitous Fred, who kept Beth in constant terror by his<br/>pranks.<br/><br/>It was not far to Longmeadow, but the tent was pitched and the<br/>wickets down by the time they arrived. A pleasant green field, with<br/>three wide-spreading oaks in the middle and a smooth strip of turf<br/>for croquet.<br/><br/>"Welcome to Camp Laurence!" said the young host, as they landed<br/>with exclamations of delight.<br/><br/>"Brooke is commander in chief, I am commissary general, the<br/>other fellows are staff officers, and you, ladies, are company. The<br/>tent is for your especial benefit and that oak is your drawing<br/>room, this is the messroom and the third is the camp kitchen. Now,<br/>let's have a game before it gets hot, and then we'll see about<br/>dinner."<br/><br/>Frank, Beth, Amy, and Grace sat down to watch the game played by<br/>the other eight. Mr. Brooke chose Meg, Kate, and Fred. Laurie took<br/>Sallie, Jo, and Ned. The English played well, but the Americans<br/>played better, and contested every inch of the ground as strongly<br/>as if the spirit of '76 inspired them. Jo and Fred had several<br/>skirmishes and once narrowly escaped high words. Jo was through the<br/>last wicket and had missed the stroke, which failure ruffled her a<br/>good deal. Fred was close behind her and his turn came before hers.<br/>He gave a stroke, his ball hit the wicket, and stopped an inch on<br/>the wrong side. No one was very near, and running up to examine, he<br/>gave it a sly nudge with his toe, which put it just an inch on the<br/>right side.<br/><br/>"I'm through! Now, Miss Jo, I'll settle you, and get in first,"<br/>cried the young gentleman, swinging his mallet for another<br/>blow.<br/><br/>"You pushed it. I saw you. It's my turn now," said Jo<br/>sharply.<br/>
