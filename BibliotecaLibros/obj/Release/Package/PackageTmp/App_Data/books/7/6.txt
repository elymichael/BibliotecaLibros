myself. I've wanted it so long," said Jo, who was a bookworm.

"I planned to spend mine in new music," said Beth, with a little
sigh, which no one heard but the hearth brush and
kettle-holder.

"I shall get a nice box of Faber's drawing pencils; I really
need them," said Amy decidedly.

"Mother didn't say anything about our money, and she won't wish
us to give up everything. Let's each buy what we want, and have a
little fun; I'm sure we work hard enough to earn it," cried Jo,
examining the heels of her shoes in a gentlemanly manner.

"I know I doâ€”teaching those tiresome children nearly all day,
when I'm longing to enjoy myself at home," began Meg, in the
complaining tone again.

"You don't have half such a hard time as I do," said Jo. "How
would you like to be shut up for hours with a nervous, fussy old
lady, who keeps you trotting, is never satisfied, and worries you
till you're ready to fly out the window or cry?"

"It's naughty to fret, but I do think washing dishes and keeping
things tidy is the worst work in the world. It makes me cross, and
my hands get so stiff, I can't practice well at all." And Beth
looked at her rough hands with a sigh that any one could hear that
time.

"I don't believe any of you suffer as I do," cried Amy, "for you
don't have to go to school with impertinent girls, who plague you
if you don't know your lessons, and laugh at your dresses, and
label your father if he isn't rich, and insult you when your nose
isn't nice."

"If you mean libel, I'd say so, and not talk about labels, as if
Papa was a pickle bottle," advised Jo, laughing.

"I know what I mean, and you needn't be statirical about it.
It's proper to use good words, and improve your vocabilary,"
returned Amy, with dignity.
