"Hope the next will end better," muttered Jo, who found it very<br/>hard to see Meg absorbed in a stranger before her face, for Jo<br/>loved a few persons very dearly and dreaded to have their affection<br/>lost or lessened in any way.<br/><br/>"I hope the third year from this will end better. I mean it<br/>shall, if I live to work out my plans," said Mr. Brooke, smiling at<br/>Meg, as if everything had become possible to him now.<br/><br/>"Doesn't it seem very long to wait?" asked Amy, who was in a<br/>hurry for the wedding.<br/><br/>"I've got so much to learn before I shall be ready, it seems a<br/>short time to me," answered Meg, with a sweet gravity in her face<br/>never seen there before.<br/><br/>"You have only to wait, I am to do the work," said John<br/>beginning his labors by picking up Meg's napkin, with an expression<br/>which caused Jo to shake her head, and then say to herself with an<br/>air of relief as the front door banged, "Here comes Laurie. Now we<br/>shall have some sensible conversation."<br/><br/>But Jo was mistaken, for Laurie came prancing in, overflowing<br/>with good spirits, bearing a great bridal-looking bouquet for 'Mrs.<br/>John Brooke', and evidently laboring under the delusion that the<br/>whole affair had been brought about by his excellent<br/>management.<br/><br/>"I knew Brooke would have it all his own way, he always does,<br/>for when he makes up his mind to accomplish anything, it's done<br/>though the sky falls," said Laurie, when he had presented his<br/>offering and his congratulations.<br/><br/>"Much obliged for that recommendation. I take it as a good omen<br/>for the future and invite you to my wedding on the spot," answered<br/>Mr. Brooke, who felt at peace with all mankind, even his<br/>mischievous pupil.<br/><br/>"I'll come if I'm at the ends of the earth, for the sight of<br/>Jo's face alone on that occasion would be worth a long journey. You<br/>don't look festive, ma'am, what's the matter?" asked Laurie,<br/>following her into a corner of the parlor, whither all had<br/>adjourned to greet Mr. Laurence.<br/><br/>"I don't approve of the match, but I've made up my mind to bear<br/>it, and shall not say a word against it," said Jo solemnly. "You<br/>can't know how hard it is for me to give up Meg," she continued<br/>with a little quiver in her voice.<br/><br/>"You don't give her up. You only go halves," said Laurie<br/>consolingly.<br/>
