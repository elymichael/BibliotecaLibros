<br/>"I know! I know! You're going to the theater to see<br/>the&#160;<br/>Seven Castles!<br/>" she cried, adding resolutely,<br/>"and I shall go, for Mother said I might see it, and I've got my<br/>rag money, and it was mean not to tell me in time."<br/><br/>"Just listen to me a minute, and be a good child," said Meg<br/>soothingly. "Mother doesn't wish you to go this week, because your<br/>eyes are not well enough yet to bear the light of this fairy piece.<br/>Next week you can go with Beth and Hannah, and have a nice<br/>time."<br/><br/>"I don't like that half as well as going with you and Laurie.<br/>Please let me. I've been sick with this cold so long, and shut up,<br/>I'm dying for some fun. Do, Meg! I'll be ever so good," pleaded<br/>Amy, looking as pathetic as she could.<br/><br/>"Suppose we take her. I don't believe Mother would mind, if we<br/>bundle her up well," began Meg.<br/><br/>"If she goes I shan't, and if I don't, Laurie won't like it, and<br/>it will be very rude, after he invited only us, to go and drag in<br/>Amy. I should think she'd hate to poke herself where she isn't<br/>wanted," said Jo crossly, for she disliked the trouble of<br/>overseeing a fidgety child when she wanted to enjoy herself.<br/><br/>Her tone and manner angered Amy, who began to put her boots on,<br/>saying, in her most aggravating way, "I shall go. Meg says I may,<br/>and if I pay for myself, Laurie hasn't anything to do with it."<br/><br/>"You can't sit with us, for our seats are reserved, and you<br/>mustn't sit alone, so Laurie will give you his place, and that will<br/>spoil our pleasure. Or he'll get another seat for you, and that<br/>isn't proper when you weren't asked. You shan't stir a step, so you<br/>may just stay where you are," scolded Jo, crosser than ever, having<br/>just pricked her finger in her hurry.<br/><br/>Sitting on the floor with one boot on, Amy began to cry and Meg<br/>to reason with her, when Laurie called from below, and the two<br/>girls hurried down, leaving their sister wailing. For now and then<br/>she forgot her grown-up ways and acted like a spoiled child. Just<br/>as the party was setting out, Amy called over the banisters in a<br/>threatening tone, "You'll be sorry for this, Jo March, see if you<br/>ain't."<br/><br/>"Fiddlesticks!" returned Jo, slamming the door.<br/><br/>
