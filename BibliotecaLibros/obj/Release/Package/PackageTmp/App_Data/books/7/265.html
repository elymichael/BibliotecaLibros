Her family and friends administered comfort and commendation<br/>liberally. Yet it was a hard time for sensitive, high-spirited Jo,<br/>who meant so well and had apparently done so ill. But it did her<br/>good, for those whose opinion had real value gave her the criticism<br/>which is an author's best education, and when the first soreness<br/>was over, she could laugh at her poor little book, yet believe in<br/>it still, and feel herself the wiser and stronger for the buffeting<br/>she had received.<br/><br/>"Not being a genius, like Keats, it won't kill me," she said<br/>stoutly, "and I've got the joke on my side, after all, for the<br/>parts that were taken straight out of real life are denounced as<br/>impossible and absurd, and the scenes that I made up out of my own<br/>silly head are pronounced 'charmingly natural, tender, and true'.<br/>So I'll comfort myself with that, and when I'm ready, I'll up again<br/>and take another."<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
