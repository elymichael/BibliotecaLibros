"I used to be so frightened when it was my turn to sit in the
chair with the crown on, and see you all come marching round to
give the presents, with a kiss. I liked the things and the kisses,
but it was dreadful to have you sit looking at me while I opened
the bundles," said Beth, who was toasting her face and the bread
for tea at the same time.

"Let Marmee think we are getting things for ourselves, and then
surprise her. We must go shopping tomorrow afternoon, Meg. There is
so much to do about the play for Christmas night," said Jo,
marching up and down, with her hands behind her back, and her nose
in the air.

"I don't mean to act any more after this time. I'm getting too
old for such things," observed Meg, who was as much a child as ever
about 'dressing-up' frolics.

"You won't stop, I know, as long as you can trail round in a
white gown with your hair down, and wear gold-paper jewelry. You
are the best actress we've got, and there'll be an end of
everything if you quit the boards," said Jo. "We ought to rehearse
tonight. Come here, Amy, and do the fainting scene, for you are as
stiff as a poker in that."

"I can't help it. I never saw anyone faint, and I don't choose
to make myself all black and blue, tumbling flat as you do. If I
can go down easily, I'll drop. If I can't, I shall fall into a
chair and be graceful. I don't care if Hugo does come at me with a
pistol," returned Amy, who was not gifted with dramatic power, but
was chosen because she was small enough to be borne out shrieking
by the villain of the piece.

"Do it this way. Clasp your hands so, and stagger across the
room, crying frantically, 'Roderigo! Save me! Save me!'" and away
went Jo, with a melodramatic scream which was truly thrilling.

Amy followed, but she poked her hands out stiffly before her,
and jerked herself along as if she went by machinery, and her "Ow!"
was more suggestive of pins being run into her than of fear and
anguish. Jo gave a despairing groan, and Meg laughed outright,
while Beth let her bread burn as she watched the fun with interest.
"It's no use! Do the best you can when the time comes, and if the
audience laughs, don't blame me. Come on, Meg."

Then things went smoothly, for Don Pedro defied the world in a
speech of two pages without a single break. Hagar, the witch,
chanted an awful incantation over her kettleful of simmering toads,
with weird effect. Roderigo rent his chains asunder manfully, and
Hugo died in agonies of remorse and arsenic, with a wild, "Ha!
Ha!"

"It's the best we've had yet," said Meg, as the dead villain sat
up and rubbed his elbows.

"I don't see how you can write and act such splendid things, Jo.
You're a regular Shakespeare!" exclaimed Beth, who firmly believed
that her sisters were gifted with wonderful genius in all
things.
