"Don't peck at one another, children. Don't you wish we had the<br/>money Papa lost when we were little, Jo? Dear me! How happy and<br/>good we'd be, if we had no worries!" said Meg, who could remember<br/>better times.<br/><br/>"You said the other day you thought we were a deal happier than<br/>the King children, for they were fighting and fretting all the<br/>time, in spite of their money."<br/><br/>"So I did, Beth. Well, I think we are. For though we do have to<br/>work, we make fun of ourselves, and are a pretty jolly set, as Jo<br/>would say."<br/><br/>"Jo does use such slang words!" observed Amy, with a reproving<br/>look at the long figure stretched on the rug.<br/><br/>Jo immediately sat up, put her hands in her pockets, and began<br/>to whistle.<br/><br/>"Don't, Jo. It's so boyish!"<br/><br/>"That's why I do it."<br/><br/>"I detest rude, unladylike girls!"<br/><br/>"I hate affected, niminy-piminy chits!"<br/><br/>"Birds in their little nests agree," sang Beth, the peacemaker,<br/>with such a funny face that both sharp voices softened to a laugh,<br/>and the "pecking" ended for that time.<br/><br/>"Really, girls, you are both to be blamed," said Meg, beginning<br/>to lecture in her elder-sisterly fashion. "You are old enough to<br/>leave off boyish tricks, and to behave better, Josephine. It didn't<br/>matter so much when you were a little girl, but now you are so<br/>tall, and turn up your hair, you should remember that you are a<br/>young lady."<br/>
