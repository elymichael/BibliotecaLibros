________<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>A SAD ACCIDENT<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>On Friday last, we were startled by a violent shock in our<br/>basement, followed by cries of distress. On rushing in a body to<br/>the cellar, we discovered our beloved President prostrate upon the<br/>floor, having tripped and fallen while getting wood for domestic<br/>purposes. A perfect scene of ruin met our eyes, for in his fall Mr.<br/>Pickwick had plunged his head and shoulders into a tub of water,<br/>upset a keg of soft soap upon his manly form, and torn his garments<br/>badly. On being removed from this perilous situation, it was<br/>discovered that he had suffered no injury but several bruises, and<br/>we are happy to add, is now doing well.<br/><br/>ED.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>________<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>THE PUBLIC BEREAVEMENT<br/><br/>&#160;<br/>
