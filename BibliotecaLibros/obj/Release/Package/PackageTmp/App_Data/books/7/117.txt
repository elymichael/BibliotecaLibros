"I say, isn't bread 'riz' enough when it runs over the
pans?"

Sallie began to laugh, but Meg nodded and lifted her eyebrows as
high as they would go, which caused the apparition to vanish and
put the sour bread into the oven without further delay. Mrs. March
went out, after peeping here and there to see how matters went,
also saying a word of comfort to Beth, who sat making a winding
sheet, while the dear departed lay in state in the domino box. A
strange sense of helplessness fell upon the girls as the gray
bonnet vanished round the corner, and despair seized them when a
few minutes later Miss Crocker appeared, and said she'd come to
dinner. Now this lady was a thin, yellow spinster, with a sharp
nose and inquisitive eyes, who saw everything and gossiped about
all she saw. They disliked her, but had been taught to be kind to
her, simply because she was old and poor and had few friends. So
Meg gave her the easy chair and tried to entertain her, while she
asked questions, critsized everything, and told stories of the
people whom she knew.

Language cannot describe the anxieties, experiences, and
exertions which Jo underwent that morning, and the dinner she
served up became a standing joke. Fearing to ask any more advice,
she did her best alone, and discovered that something more than
energy and good will is necessary to make a cook. She boiled the
asparagus for an hour and was grieved to find the heads cooked off
and the stalks harder than ever. The bread burned black; for the
salad dressing so aggravated her that she could not make it fit to
eat. The lobster was a scarlet mystery to her, but she hammered and
poked till it was unshelled and its meager proportions concealed in
a grove of lettuce leaves. The potatoes had to be hurried, not to
keep the asparagus waiting, and were not done at the last. The
blanc mange was lumpy, and the strawberries not as ripe as they
looked, having been skilfully 'deaconed'.

"Well, they can eat beef and bread and butter, if they are
hungry, only it's mortifying to have to spend your whole morning
for nothing," thought Jo, as she rang the bell half an hour later
than usual, and stood, hot, tired, and dispirited, surveying the
feast spread before Laurie, accustomed to all sorts of elegance,
and Miss Crocker, whose tattling tongue would report them far and
wide.

Poor Jo would gladly have gone under the table, as one thing
after another was tasted and left, while Amy giggled, Meg looked
distressed, Miss Crocker pursed her lips, and Laurie talked and
laughed with all his might to give a cheerful tone to the festive
scene. Jo's one strong point was the fruit, for she had sugared it
well, and had a pitcher of rich cream to eat with it. Her hot
cheeks cooled a trifle, and she drew a long breath as the pretty
glass plates went round, and everyone looked graciously at the
little rosy islands floating in a sea of cream. Miss Crocker tasted
first, made a wry face, and drank some water hastily. Jo, who
refused, thinking there might not be enough, for they dwindled
sadly after the picking over, glanced at Laurie, but he was eating
away manfully, though there was a slight pucker about his mouth and
he kept his eye fixed on his plate. Amy, who was fond of delicate
fare, took a heaping spoonful, choked, hid her face in her napkin,
and left the table precipitately.

"Oh, what is it?" exclaimed Jo, trembling.

"Salt instead of sugar, and the cream is sour," replied Meg with
a tragic gesture.

Jo uttered a groan and fell back in her chair, remembering that
she had given a last hasty powdering to the berries out of one of
the two boxes on the kitchen table, and had neglected to put the
milk in the refrigerator. She turned scarlet and was on the verge
of crying, when she met Laurie's eyes, which would look merry in
spite of his heroic efforts. The comical side of the affair
suddenly struck her, and she laughed till the tears ran down her
cheeks. So did everyone else, even 'Croaker' as the girls called
the old lady, and the unfortunate dinner ended gaily, with bread
and butter, olives and fun.

"I haven't strength of mind enough to clear up now, so we will
sober ourselves with a funeral," said Jo, as they rose, and Miss
Crocker made ready to go, being eager to tell the new story at
another friend's dinner table.

They did sober themselves for Beth's sake. Laurie dug a grave
under the ferns in the grove, little Pip was laid in, with many
tears by his tender-hearted mistress, and covered with moss, while
a wreath of violets and chickweed was hung on the stone which bore
his epitaph, composed by Jo while she struggled with the
dinner.
