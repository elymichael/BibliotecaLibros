"No, I won't. I shall tell him I've made up my mind, and shall
walk out of the room with dignity."

Meg rose as she spoke, and was just going to rehearse the
dignified exit, when a step in the hall made her fly into her seat
and begin to sew as fast as if her life depended on finishing that
particular seam in a given time. Jo smothered a laugh at the sudden
change, and when someone gave a modest tap, opened the door with a
grim aspect which was anything but hospitable.

"Good afternoon. I came to get my umbrella, that is, to see how
your father finds himself today," said Mr. Brooke, getting a trifle
confused as his eyes went from one telltale face to the other.

"It's very well, he's in the rack. I'll get him, and tell it you
are here." And having jumbled her father and the umbrella well
together in her reply, Jo slipped out of the room to give Meg a
chance to make her speech and air her dignity. But the instant she
vanished, Meg began to sidle toward the door, murmuring…

"Mother will like to see you. Pray sit down, I'll call her."

"Don't go. Are you afraid of me, Margaret?" and Mr. Brooke
looked so hurt that Meg thought she must have done something very
rude. She blushed up to the little curls on her forehead, for he
had never called her Margaret before, and she was surprised to find
how natural and sweet it seemed to hear him say it. Anxious to
appear friendly and at her ease, she put out her hand with a
confiding gesture, and said gratefully…

"How can I be afraid when you have been so kind to Father? I
only wish I could thank you for it."

"Shall I tell you how?" asked Mr. Brooke, holding the small hand
fast in both his own, and looking down at Meg with so much love in
the brown eyes that her heart began to flutter, and she both longed
to run away and to stop and listen.

"Oh no, please don't, I'd rather not," she said, trying to
withdraw her hand, and looking frightened in spite of her
denial.

"I won't trouble you. I only want to know if you care for me a
little, Meg. I love you so much, dear," added Mr. Brooke
tenderly.

This was the moment for the calm, proper speech, but Meg didn't
make it. She forgot every word of it, hung her head, and answered,
"I don't know," so softly that John had to stoop down to catch the
foolish little reply.
