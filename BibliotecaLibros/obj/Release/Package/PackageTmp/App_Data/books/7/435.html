<br/>"And you expect to live on the produce of the place? Well, that<br/>sounds paradisiacal, but you'll find it desperate hard work."<br/><br/>"The crop we are going to raise is a profitable one," and Jo<br/>laughed.<br/><br/>"Of what is this fine crop to consist, ma'am?"<br/><br/>"Boys. I want to open a school for little lads—a good, happy,<br/>homelike school, with me to take care of them and Fritz to teach<br/>them."<br/><br/>"That's a truly Joian plan for you! Isn't that just like her?"<br/>cried Laurie, appealing to the family, who looked as much surprised<br/>as he.<br/><br/>"I like it," said Mrs. March decidedly.<br/><br/>"So do I," added her husband, who welcomed the thought of a<br/>chance for trying the Socratic method of education on modern<br/>youth.<br/><br/>"It will be an immense care for Jo," said Meg, stroking the head<br/>of her one all-absorbing son.<br/><br/>"Jo can do it, and be happy in it. It's a splendid idea. Tell us<br/>all about it," cried Mr. Laurence, who had been longing to lend the<br/>lovers a hand, but knew that they would refuse his help.<br/><br/>"I knew you'd stand by me, sir. Amy does too—I see it in her<br/>eyes, though she prudently waits to turn it over in her mind before<br/>she speaks. Now, my dear people," continued Jo earnestly, "just<br/>understand that this isn't a new idea of mine, but a long cherished<br/>plan. Before my Fritz came, I used to think how, when I'd made my<br/>fortune, and no one needed me at home, I'd hire a big house, and<br/>pick up some poor, forlorn little lads who hadn't any mothers, and<br/>take care of them, and make life jolly for them before it was too<br/>late. I see so many going to ruin for want of help at the right<br/>minute, I love so to do anything for them, I seem to feel their<br/>wants, and sympathize with their troubles, and oh, I should so like<br/>to be a mother to them!"<br/><br/>
