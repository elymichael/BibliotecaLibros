<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>22<br/>Daisy and Demi<br/><br/><br/>I cannot feel that I have done my duty as humble historian of<br/>the March family, without devoting at least one chapter to the two<br/>most precious and important members of it. Daisy and Demi had now<br/>arrived at years of discretion, for in this fast age babies of<br/>three or four assert their rights, and get them, too, which is more<br/>than many of their elders do. If there ever were a pair of twins in<br/>danger of being utterly spoiled by adoration, it was these<br/>prattling Brookes. Of course they were the most remarkable children<br/>ever born, as will be shown when I mention that they walked at<br/>eight months, talked fluently at twelve months, and at two years<br/>they took their places at table, and behaved with a propriety which<br/>charmed all beholders. At three, Daisy demanded a 'needler', and<br/>actually made a bag with four stitches in it. She likewise set up<br/>housekeeping in the sideboard, and managed a microscopic cooking<br/>stove with a skill that brought tears of pride to Hannah's eyes,<br/>while Demi learned his letters with his grandfather, who invented a<br/>new mode of teaching the alphabet by forming letters with his arms<br/>and legs, thus uniting gymnastics for head and heels. The boy early<br/>developed a mechanical genius which delighted his father and<br/>distracted his mother, for he tried to imitate every machine he<br/>saw, and kept the nursery in a chaotic condition, with his<br/>'sewinsheen', a mysterious structure of string, chairs,<br/>clothespins, and spools, for wheels to go 'wound and wound'. Also a<br/>basket hung over the back of a chair, in which he vainly tried to<br/>hoist his too confiding sister, who, with feminine devotion,<br/>allowed her little head to be bumped till rescued, when the young<br/>inventor indignantly remarked, "Why, Marmar, dat's my lellywaiter,<br/>and me's trying to pull her up."<br/><br/>Though utterly unlike in character, the twins got on remarkably<br/>well together, and seldom quarreled more than thrice a day. Of<br/>course, Demi tyrannized over Daisy, and gallantly defended her from<br/>every other aggressor, while Daisy made a galley slave of herself,<br/>and adored her brother as the one perfect being in the world. A<br/>rosy, chubby, sunshiny little soul was Daisy, who found her way to<br/>everybody's heart, and nestled there. One of the captivating<br/>children, who seem made to be kissed and cuddled, adorned and<br/>adored like little goddesses, and produced for general approval on<br/>all festive occasions. Her small virtues were so sweet that she<br/>would have been quite angelic if a few small naughtinesses had not<br/>kept her delightfully human. It was all fair weather in her world,<br/>and every morning she scrambled up to the window in her little<br/>nightgown to look out, and say, no matter whether it rained or<br/>shone, "Oh, pitty day, oh, pitty day!" Everyone was a friend, and<br/>she offered kisses to a stranger so confidingly that the most<br/>inveterate bachelor relented, and baby-lovers became faithful<br/>worshipers.<br/><br/>"Me loves evvybody," she once said, opening her arms, with her<br/>spoon in one hand, and her mug in the other, as if eager to embrace<br/>and nourish the whole world.<br/><br/>As she grew, her mother began to feel that the Dovecote would be<br/>blessed by the presence of an inmate as serene and loving as that<br/>which had helped to make the old house home, and to pray that she<br/>might be spared a loss like that which had lately taught them how<br/>long they had entertained an angel unawares. Her grandfather often<br/>called her 'Beth', and her grandmother watched over her with<br/>untiring devotion, as if trying to atone for some past mistake,<br/>which no eye but her own could see.<br/><br/>Demi, like a true Yankee, was of an inquiring turn, wanting to<br/>know everything, and often getting much disturbed because he could<br/>not get satisfactory answers to his perpetual "What for?"<br/><br/>He also possessed a philosophic bent, to the great delight of<br/>his grandfather, who used to hold Socratic conversations with him,<br/>in which the precocious pupil occasionally posed his teacher, to<br/>the undisguised satisfaction of the womenfolk.<br/><br/>"What makes my legs go, Dranpa?" asked the young philosopher,<br/>surveying those active portions of his frame with a meditative air,<br/>while resting after a go-to-bed frolic one night.<br/>
