"If god spares Beth, I'll try to love and serve Him all my<br/>life," answered Jo, with equal fervor.<br/><br/>"I wish I had no heart, it aches so," sighed Meg, after a<br/>pause.<br/><br/>"If life is often as hard as this, I don't see how we ever shall<br/>get through it," added her sister despondently.<br/><br/>Here the clock struck twelve, and both forgot themselves in<br/>watching Beth, for they fancied a change passed over her wan face.<br/>The house was still as death, and nothing but the wailing of the<br/>wind broke the deep hush. Weary Hannah slept on, and no one but the<br/>sisters saw the pale shadow which seemed to fall upon the little<br/>bed. An hour went by, and nothing happened except Laurie's quiet<br/>departure for the station. Another hour, still no one came, and<br/>anxious fears of delay in the storm, or accidents by the way, or,<br/>worst of all, a great grief at Washington, haunted the girls.<br/><br/>It was past two, when Jo, who stood at the window thinking how<br/>dreary the world looked in its winding sheet of snow, heard a<br/>movement by the bed, and turning quickly, saw Meg kneeling before<br/>their mother's easy chair with her face hidden. A dreadful fear<br/>passed coldly over Jo, as she thought, "Beth is dead, and Meg is<br/>afraid to tell me."<br/><br/>She was back at her post in an instant, and to her excited eyes<br/>a great change seemed to have taken place. The fever flush and the<br/>look of pain were gone, and the beloved little face looked so pale<br/>and peaceful in its utter repose that Jo felt no desire to weep or<br/>to lament. Leaning low over this dearest of her sisters, she kissed<br/>the damp forehead with her heart on her lips, and softly whispered,<br/>"Goodby, my Beth. Goodby!"<br/><br/>As if awaked by the stir, Hannah started out of her sleep,<br/>hurried to the bed, looked at Beth, felt her hands, listened at her<br/>lips, and then, throwing her apron over her head, sat down to rock<br/>to and fro, exclaiming, under her breath, "The fever's turned,<br/>she's sleepin' nat'ral, her skin's damp, and she breathes easy.<br/>Praise be given! Oh, my goodness me!"<br/><br/>Before the girls could believe the happy truth, the doctor came<br/>to confirm it. He was a homely man, but they thought his face quite<br/>heavenly when he smiled and said, with a fatherly look at them,<br/>"Yes, my dears, I think the little girl will pull through this<br/>time. Keep the house quiet, let her sleep, and when she wakes, give<br/>her… "<br/><br/>What they were to give, neither heard, for both crept into the<br/>dark hall, and, sitting on the stairs, held each other close,<br/>rejoicing with hearts too full for words. When they went back to be<br/>kissed and cuddled by faithful Hannah, they found Beth lying, as<br/>she used to do, with her cheek pillowed on her hand, the dreadful<br/>pallor gone, and breathing quietly, as if just fallen asleep.<br/><br/>"If Mother would only come now!" said Jo, as the winter night<br/>began to wane.<br/><br/>"See," said Meg, coming up with a white, half-opened rose, "I<br/>thought this would hardly be ready to lay in Beth's hand tomorrow<br/>if she—went away from us. But it has blossomed in the night, and<br/>now I mean to put it in my vase here, so that when the darling<br/>wakes, the first thing she sees will be the little rose, and<br/>Mother's face."<br/>
