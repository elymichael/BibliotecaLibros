"Why should you, with so much energy and talent?"

"That's just why, because talent isn't genius, and no amount of
energy can make it so. I want to be great, or nothing. I won't be a
common-place dauber, so I don't intend to try any more."

"And what are you going to do with yourself now, if I may
ask?"

"Polish up my other talents, and be an ornament to society, if I
get the chance."

It was a characteristic speech, and sounded daring, but audacity
becomes young people, and Amy's ambition had a good foundation.
Laurie smiled, but he liked the spirit with which she took up a new
purpose when a long-cherished one died, and spent no time
lamenting.

"Good! And here is where Fred Vaughn comes in, I fancy."

Amy preserved a discreet silence, but there was a conscious look
in her downcast face that made Laurie sit up and say gravely, "Now
I'm going to play brother, and ask questions. May I?"

"I don't promise to answer."

"Your face will, if your tongue won't. You aren't woman of the
world enough yet to hide your feelings, my dear. I heard rumors
about Fred and you last year, and it's my private opinion that if
he had not been called home so suddenly and detained so long,
something would have come of it, hey?"

"That's not for me to say," was Amy's grim reply, but her lips
would smile, and there was a traitorous sparkle of the eye which
betrayed that she knew her power and enjoyed the knowledge.
