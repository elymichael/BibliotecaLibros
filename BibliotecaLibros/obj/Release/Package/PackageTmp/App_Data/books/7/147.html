<br/>"I hope I shall have done something to be proud of by that time,<br/>but I'm such a lazy dog, I'm afraid I shall dawdle, Jo."<br/><br/>"You need a motive, Mother says, and when you get it, she is<br/>sure you'll work splendidly."<br/><br/>"Is she? By Jupiter, I will, if I only get the chance!" cried<br/>Laurie, sitting up with sudden energy. "I ought to be satisfied to<br/>please Grandfather, and I do try, but it's working against the<br/>grain, you see, and comes hard. He wants me to be an India<br/>merchant, as he was, and I'd rather be shot. I hate tea and silk<br/>and spices, and every sort of rubbish his old ships bring, and I<br/>don't care how soon they go to the bottom when I own them. Going to<br/>college ought to satisfy him, for if I give him four years he ought<br/>to let me off from the business. But he's set, and I've got to do<br/>just as he did, unless I break away and please myself, as my father<br/>did. If there was anyone left to stay with the old gentleman, I'd<br/>do it tomorrow."<br/><br/>Laurie spoke excitedly, and looked ready to carry his threat<br/>into execution on the slightest provocation, for he was growing up<br/>very fast and, in spite of his indolent ways, had a young man's<br/>hatred of subjection, a young man's restless longing to try the<br/>world for himself.<br/><br/>"I advise you to sail away in one of your ships, and never come<br/>home again till you have tried your own way," said Jo, whose<br/>imagination was fired by the thought of such a daring exploit, and<br/>whose sympathy was excited by what she called 'Teddy's Wrongs'.<br/><br/>"That's not right, Jo. You mustn't talk in that way, and Laurie<br/>mustn't take your bad advice. You should do just what your<br/>grandfather wishes, my dear boy," said Meg in her most maternal<br/>tone. "Do your best at college, and when he sees that you try to<br/>please him, I'm sure he won't be hard on you or unjust to you. As<br/>you say, there is no one else to stay with and love him, and you'd<br/>never forgive yourself if you left him without his permission.<br/>Don't be dismal or fret, but do your duty and you'll get your<br/>reward, as good Mr. Brooke has, by being respected and loved."<br/><br/>"What do you know about him?" asked Laurie, grateful for the<br/>good advice, but objecting to the lecture, and glad to turn the<br/>conversation from himself after his unusual outbreak.<br/><br/>"Only what your grandpa told us about him, how he took good care<br/>of his own mother till she died, and wouldn't go abroad as tutor to<br/>some nice person because he wouldn't leave her. And how he provides<br/>now for an old woman who nursed his mother, and never tells anyone,<br/>but is just as generous and patient and good as he can be."<br/><br/>"So he is, dear old fellow!" said Laurie heartily, as Meg<br/>paused, looking flushed and earnest with her story. "It's like<br/>Grandpa to find out all about him without letting him know, and to<br/>tell all his goodness to others, so that they might like him.<br/>Brooke couldn't understand why your mother was so kind to him,<br/>asking him over with me and treating him in her beautiful friendly<br/>way. He thought she was just perfect, and talked about it for days<br/>and days, and went on about you all in flaming style. If ever I do<br/>get my wish, you see what I'll do for Brooke."<br/><br/>"Begin to do something now by not plaguing his life out," said<br/>Meg sharply.<br/><br/>
