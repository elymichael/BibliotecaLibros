And I don't like<br/>the way fellows do either, in this country."<br/><br/>"What do you like?"<br/><br/>"To live in Italy, and to enjoy myself in my own way."<br/><br/>Jo wanted very much to ask what his own way was, but his black<br/>brows looked rather threatening as he knit them, so she changed the<br/>subject by saying, as her foot kept time, "That's a splendid polka!<br/>Why don't you go and try it?"<br/><br/>"If you will come too," he answered, with a gallant little<br/>bow.<br/><br/>"I can't, for I told Meg I wouldn't, becauseâ€¦ " There Jo<br/>stopped, and looked undecided whether to tell or to laugh.<br/><br/>"Because, what?"<br/><br/>"You won't tell?"<br/><br/>"Never!"<br/><br/>"Well, I have a bad trick of standing before the fire, and so I<br/>burn my frocks, and I scorched this one, and though it's nicely<br/>mended, it shows, and Meg told me to keep still so no one would see<br/>it. You may laugh, if you want to. It is funny, I know."<br/><br/>But Laurie didn't laugh. He only looked down a minute, and the<br/>expression of his face puzzled Jo when he said very gently, "Never<br/>mind that. I'll tell you how we can manage. There's a long hall out<br/>there, and we can dance grandly, and no one will see us. Please<br/>come."<br/>
