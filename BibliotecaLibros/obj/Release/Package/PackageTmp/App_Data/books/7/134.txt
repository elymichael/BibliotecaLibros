"Oh, yes, of course it's very nice and proper in them to do so.
We have many most respectable and worthy young women who do the
same and are employed by the nobility, because, being the daughters
of gentlemen, they are both well bred and accomplished, you know,"
said Miss Kate in a patronizing tone that hurt Meg's pride, and
made her work seem not only more distasteful, but degrading.

"Did the German song suit, Miss March?" inquired Mr. Brooke,
breaking an awkward pause.

"Oh, yes! It was very sweet, and I'm much obliged to whoever
translated it for me." And Meg's downcast face brightened as she
spoke.

"Don't you read German?" asked Miss Kate with a look of
surprise.

"Not very well. My father, who taught me, is away, and I don't
get on very fast alone, for I've no one to correct my
pronunciation."

"Try a little now. Here is Schiller's Mary Stuart and a tutor
who loves to teach." And Mr. Brooke laid his book on her lap with
an inviting smile.

"It's so hard I'm afraid to try," said Meg, grateful, but
bashful in the presence of the accomplished young lady beside
her.

"I'll read a bit to encourage you." And Miss Kate read one of
the most beautiful passages in a perfectly correct but perfectly
expressionless manner.

Mr. Brooke made no comment as she returned the book to Meg, who
said innocently, "I thought it was poetry."

"Some of it is. Try this passage."
