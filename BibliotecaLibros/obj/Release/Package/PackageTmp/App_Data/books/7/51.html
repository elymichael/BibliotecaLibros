Much elated with her success, Jo did 'tell on', all about their<br/>plays and plans, their hopes and fears for Father, and the most<br/>interesting events of the little world in which the sisters lived.<br/>Then they got to talking about books, and to Jo's delight, she<br/>found that Laurie loved them as well as she did, and had read even<br/>more than herself.<br/><br/>"If you like them so much, come down and see ours. Grandfather<br/>is out, so you needn't be afraid," said Laurie, getting up.<br/><br/>"I'm not afraid of anything," returned Jo, with a toss of the<br/>head.<br/><br/>"I don't believe you are!" exclaimed the boy, looking at her<br/>with much admiration, though he privately thought she would have<br/>good reason to be a trifle afraid of the old gentleman, if she met<br/>him in some of his moods.<br/><br/>The atmosphere of the whole house being summerlike, Laurie led<br/>the way from room to room, letting Jo stop to examine whatever<br/>struck her fancy. And so, at last they came to the library, where<br/>she clapped her hands and pranced, as she always did when<br/>especially delighted. It was lined with books, and there were<br/>pictures and statues, and distracting little cabinets full of coins<br/>and curiosities, and Sleepy Hollow chairs, and queer tables, and<br/>bronzes, and best of all, a great open fireplace with quaint tiles<br/>all round it.<br/><br/>"What richness!" sighed Jo, sinking into the depth of a velour<br/>chair and gazing about her with an air of intense satisfaction.<br/>"Theodore Laurence, you ought to be the happiest boy in the world,"<br/>she added impressively.<br/><br/>"A fellow can't live on books," said Laurie, shaking his head as<br/>he perched on a table opposite.<br/><br/>Before he could more, a bell rang, and Jo flew up, exclaiming<br/>with alarm, "Mercy me! It's your grandpa!"<br/><br/>"Well, what if it is? You are not afraid of anything, you know,"<br/>returned the boy, looking wicked.<br/><br/>"I think I am a little bit afraid of him, but I don't know why I<br/>should be. Marmee said I might come, and I don't think you're any<br/>the worse for it," said Jo, composing herself, though she kept her<br/>eyes on the door.<br/><br/>"I'm a great deal better for it, and ever so much obliged. I'm<br/>only afraid you are very tired of talking to me. It was so<br/>pleasant, I couldn't bear to stop," said Laurie gratefully.<br/>
