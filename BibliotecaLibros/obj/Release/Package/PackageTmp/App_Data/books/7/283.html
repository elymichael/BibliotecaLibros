<br/>"So we are to countenance things and people which we detest,<br/>merely because we are not belles and millionaires, are we? That's a<br/>nice sort of morality."<br/><br/>"I can't argue about it, I only know that it's the way of the<br/>world, and people who set themselves against it only get laughed at<br/>for their pains. I don't like reformers, and I hope you never try<br/>to be one."<br/><br/>"I do like them, and I shall be one if I can, for in spite of<br/>the laughing the world would never get on without them. We can't<br/>agree about that, for you belong to the old set, and I to the new.<br/>You will get on the best, but I shall have the liveliest time of<br/>it. I should rather enjoy the brickbats and hooting, I think."<br/><br/>"Well, compose yourself now, and don't worry Aunt with your new<br/>ideas."<br/><br/>"I'll try not to, but I'm always possessed to burst out with<br/>some particularly blunt speech or revolutionary sentiment before<br/>her. It's my doom, and I can't help it."<br/><br/>They found Aunt Carrol with the old lady, both absorbed in some<br/>very interesting subject, but they dropped it as the girls came in,<br/>with a conscious look which betrayed that they had been talking<br/>about their nieces. Jo was not in a good humor, and the perverse<br/>fit returned, but Amy, who had virtuously done her duty, kept her<br/>temper and pleased everybody, was in a most angelic frame of mind.<br/>This amiable spirit was felt at once, and both aunts 'my deared'<br/>her affectionately, looking what they afterward said emphatically,<br/>"That child improves every day."<br/><br/>"Are you going to help about the fair, dear?" asked Mrs. Carrol,<br/>as Amy sat down beside her with the confiding air elderly people<br/>like so well in the young.<br/><br/>"Yes, Aunt. Mrs. Chester asked me if I would, and I offered to<br/>tend a table, as I have nothing but my time to give."<br/><br/>"I'm not," put in Jo decidedly. "I hate to be patronized, and<br/>the Chesters think it's a great favor to allow us to help with<br/>their highly connected fair. I wonder you consented, Amy, they only<br/>want you to work."<br/><br/>"I am willing to work. It's for the freedmen as well as the<br/>Chesters, and I think it very kind of them to let me share the<br/>labor and the fun. Patronage does not trouble me when it is well<br/>meant."<br/><br/>
