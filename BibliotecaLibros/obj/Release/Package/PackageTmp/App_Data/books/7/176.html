<br/>&#160;<br/><br/>A SONG FROM THE SUDS<br/><br/>Queen of my tub, I merrily sing,<br/>While the white foam rises high,<br/>And sturdily wash and rinse and wring,<br/>And fasten the clothes to dry.<br/>Then out in the free fresh air they swing,<br/>Under the sunny sky.<br/><br/>I wish we could wash from our hearts and<br/>souls<br/>The stains of the week away,<br/>And let water and air by their magic make<br/>Ourselves as pure as they.<br/>Then on the earth there would be indeed,<br/>A glorious washing day!<br/><br/>Along the path of a useful life,<br/>Will heartsease ever bloom.<br/>
