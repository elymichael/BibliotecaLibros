It did not seem at all comical to Meg, who kissed and caressed
the afflicted heroine in the tenderest manner.

"I'm not sorry," protested Jo, with a choke. "I'd do it again
tomorrow, if I could. It's only the vain part of me that goes and
cries in this silly way. Don't tell anyone, it's all over now. I
thought you were asleep, so I just made a little private moan for
my one beauty. How came you to be awake?"

"I can't sleep, I'm so anxious," said Meg.

"Think about something pleasant, and you'll soon drop off."

"I tried it, but felt wider awake than ever."

"What did you think of?"

"Handsome facesâ€”eyes particularly," answered Meg, smiling to
herself in the dark.

"What color do you like best?"

"Brown, that is, sometimes. Blue are lovely."

Jo laughed, and Meg sharply ordered her not to talk, then
amiably promised to make her hair curl, and fell asleep to dream of
living in her castle in the air.

The clocks were striking midnight and the rooms were very still
as a figure glided quietly from bed to bed, smoothing a coverlet
here, settling a pillow there, and pausing to look long and
tenderly at each unconscious face, to kiss each with lips that
mutely blessed, and to pray the fervent prayers which only mothers
utter. As she lifted the curtain to look out into the dreary night,
the moon broke suddenly from behind the clouds and shone upon her
like a bright, benignant face, which seemed to whisper in the
silence, "Be comforted, dear soul! There is always light behind the
clouds."
