"I'll tell you some day. John is going home with you, as I
can't."

"No need of that. I am not a young lady, and it's only a step.
Take care of yourself, won't you?"

"Yes, but you will come again, I hope?"

"If you promise to come and see us after you are well."

"I will."

"Good night, Laurie!"

"Good night, Jo, good night!"

When all the afternoon's adventures had been told, the family
felt inclined to go visiting in a body, for each found something
very attractive in the big house on the other side of the hedge.
Mrs. March wanted to talk of her father with the old man who had
not forgotten him, Meg longed to walk in the conservatory, Beth
sighed for the grand piano, and Amy was eager to see the fine
pictures and statues.

"Mother, why didn't Mr. Laurence like to have Laurie play?"
asked Jo, who was of an inquiring disposition.

"I am not sure, but I think it was because his son, Laurie's
father, married an Italian lady, a musician, which displeased the
old man, who is very proud. The lady was good and lovely and
accomplished, but he did not like her, and never saw his son after
he married. They both died when Laurie was a little child, and then
his grandfather took him home. I fancy the boy, who was born in
Italy, is not very strong, and the old man is afraid of losing him,
which makes him so careful. Laurie comes naturally by his love of
music, for he is like his mother, and I dare say his grandfather
fears that he may want to be a musician. At any rate, his skill
reminds him of the woman he did not like, and so he 'glowered' as
Jo said."
