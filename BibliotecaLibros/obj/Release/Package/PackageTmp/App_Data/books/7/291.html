"Didn't Hayes give you the best out of our gardens? I told him<br/>to."<br/><br/>"I didn't know that, he forgot, I suppose, and, as your grandpa<br/>was poorly, I didn't like to worry him by asking, though I did want<br/>some."<br/><br/>"Now, Jo, how could you think there was any need of asking? They<br/>are just as much yours as mine. Don't we always go halves in<br/>everything?" began Laurie, in the tone that always made Jo turn<br/>thorny.<br/><br/>"Gracious, I hope not! Half of some of your things wouldn't suit<br/>me at all. But we mustn't stand philandering here. I've got to help<br/>Amy, so you go and make yourself splendid, and if you'll be so very<br/>kind as to let Hayes take a few nice flowers up to the Hall, I'll<br/>bless you forever."<br/><br/>"Couldn't you do it now?" asked Laurie, so suggestively that Jo<br/>shut the gate in his face with inhospitable haste, and called<br/>through the bars, "Go away, Teddy, I'm busy."<br/><br/>Thanks to the conspirators, the tables were turned that night,<br/>for Hayes sent up a wilderness of flowers, with a loverly basket<br/>arranged in his best manner for a centerpiece. Then the March<br/>family turned out en masse, and Jo exerted herself to some purpose,<br/>for people not only came, but stayed, laughing at her nonsense,<br/>admiring Amy's taste, and apparently enjoying themselves very much.<br/>Laurie and his friends gallantly threw themselves into the breach,<br/>bought up the bouquets, encamped before the table, and made that<br/>corner the liveliest spot in the room. Amy was in her element now,<br/>and out of gratitude, if nothing more, was as spritely and gracious<br/>as possible, coming to the conclusion, about that time, that virtue<br/>was its own reward, after all.<br/><br/>Jo behaved herself with exemplary propriety, and when Amy was<br/>happily surrounded by her guard of honor, Jo circulated about the<br/>Hall, picking up various bits of gossip, which enlightened her upon<br/>the subject of the Chester change of base. She reproached herself<br/>for her share of the ill feeling and resolved to exonerate Amy as<br/>soon as possible. She also discovered what Amy had done about the<br/>things in the morning, and considered her a model of magnanimity.<br/>As she passed the art table, she glanced over it for her sister's<br/>things, but saw no sign of them. "Tucked away out of sight, I dare<br/>say," thought Jo, who could forgive her own wrongs, but hotly<br/>resented any insult offered her family.<br/><br/>"Good evening, Miss Jo. How does Amy get on?" asked May with a<br/>conciliatory air, for she wanted to show that she also could be<br/>generous.<br/><br/>"She has sold everything she had that was worth selling, and now<br/>she is enjoying herself. The flower table is always attractive, you<br/>know, 'especially to gentlemen'." Jo couldn't resist giving that<br/>little slap, but May took it so meekly she regretted it a minute<br/>after, and fell to praising the great vases, which still remained<br/>unsold.<br/><br/>"Is Amy's illumination anywhere about? I took a fancy to buy<br/>that for Father," said Jo, very anxious to learn the fate of her<br/>sister's work.<br/><br/>"Everything of Amy's sold long ago. I took care that the right<br/>people saw them, and they made a nice little sum of money for us,"<br/>returned May, who had overcome sundry small temptations, as well as<br/>Amy had, that day.<br/>
