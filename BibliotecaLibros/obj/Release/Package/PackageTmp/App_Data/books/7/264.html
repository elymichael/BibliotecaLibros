<br/>"Yes," said Jo, knitting her brows, "that's just it. I've been<br/>fussing over the thing so long, I really don't know whether it's<br/>good, bad, or indifferent. It will be a great help to have cool,<br/>impartial persons take a look at it, and tell me what they think of<br/>it."<br/><br/>"I wouldn't leave a word out of it. You'll spoil it if you do,<br/>for the interest of the story is more in the minds than in the<br/>actions of the people, and it will be all a muddle if you don't<br/>explain as you go on," said Meg, who firmly believed that this book<br/>was the most remarkable novel ever written.<br/><br/>"But Mr. Allen says, 'Leave out the explanations, make it brief<br/>and dramatic, and let the characters tell the story'," interrupted<br/>Jo, turning to the publisher's note.<br/><br/>"Do as he tells you. He knows what will sell, and we don't. Make<br/>a good, popular book, and get as much money as you can. By-and-by,<br/>when you've got a name, you can afford to digress, and have<br/>philosophical and metaphysical people in your novels," said Amy,<br/>who took a strictly practical view of the subject.<br/><br/>"Well," said Jo, laughing, "if my people are 'philosophical and<br/>metaphysical', it isn't my fault, for I know nothing about such<br/>things, except what I hear father say, sometimes. If I've got some<br/>of his wise ideas jumbled up with my romance, so much the better<br/>for me. Now, Beth, what do you say?"<br/><br/>"I should so like to see it printed soon," was all Beth said,<br/>and smiled in saying it. But there was an unconscious emphasis on<br/>the last word, and a wistful look in the eyes that never lost their<br/>childlike candor, which chilled Jo's heart for a minute with a<br/>forboding fear, and decided her to make her little venture<br/>'soon'.<br/><br/>So, with Spartan firmness, the young authoress laid her<br/>first-born on her table, and chopped it up as ruthlessly as any<br/>ogre. In the hope of pleasing everyone, she took everyone's advice,<br/>and like the old man and his donkey in the fable suited nobody.<br/><br/>Her father liked the metaphysical streak which had unconsciously<br/>got into it, so that was allowed to remain though she had her<br/>doubts about it. Her mother thought that there was a trifle too<br/>much description. Out, therefore it came, and with it many<br/>necessary links in the story. Meg admired the tragedy, so Jo piled<br/>up the agony to suit her, while Amy objected to the fun, and, with<br/>the best intentions in life, Jo quenched the spritly scenes which<br/>relieved the somber character of the story. Then, to complicate the<br/>ruin, she cut it down one third, and confidingly sent the poor<br/>little romance, like a picked robin, out into the big, busy world<br/>to try its fate.<br/><br/>Well, it was printed, and she got three hundred dollars for it,<br/>likewise plenty of praise and blame, both so much greater than she<br/>expected that she was thrown into a state of bewilderment from<br/>which it took her some time to recover.<br/><br/>"You said, Mother, that criticism would help me. But how can it,<br/>when it's so contradictory that I don't know whether I've written a<br/>promising book or broken all the ten commandments?" cried poor Jo,<br/>turning over a heap of notices, the perusal of which filled her<br/>with pride and joy one minute, wrath and dismay the next. "This man<br/>says, 'An exquisite book, full of truth, beauty, and earnestness.'<br/>'All is sweet, pure, and healthy.'" continued the perplexed<br/>authoress. "The next, 'The theory of the book is bad, full of<br/>morbid fancies, spiritualistic ideas, and unnatural characters.'<br/>Now, as I had no theory of any kind, don't believe in Spiritualism,<br/>and copied my characters from life, I don't see how this critic can<br/>be right. Another says, 'It's one of the best American novels which<br/>has appeared for years.' (I know better than that), and the next<br/>asserts that 'Though it is original, and written with great force<br/>and feeling, it is a dangerous book.' 'Tisn't! Some make fun of it,<br/>some overpraise, and nearly all insist that I had a deep theory to<br/>expound, when I only wrote it for the pleasure and the money. I<br/>wish I'd printed the whole or not at all, for I do hate to be so<br/>misjudged."<br/><br/>
