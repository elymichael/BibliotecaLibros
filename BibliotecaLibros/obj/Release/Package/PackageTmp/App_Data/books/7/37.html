<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>4<br/>Burdens<br/><br/><br/>"Oh, dear, how hard it does seem to take up our packs and go<br/>on," sighed Meg the morning after the party, for now the holidays<br/>were over, the week of merrymaking did not fit her for going on<br/>easily with the task she never liked.<br/><br/>"I wish it was Christmas or New Year's all the time. Wouldn't it<br/>be fun?" answered Jo, yawning dismally.<br/><br/>"We shouldn't enjoy ourselves half so much as we do now. But it<br/>does seem so nice to have little suppers and bouquets, and go to<br/>parties, and drive home, and read and rest, and not work. It's like<br/>other people, you know, and I always envy girls who do such things,<br/>I'm so fond of luxury," said Meg, trying to decide which of two<br/>shabby gowns was the least shabby.<br/><br/>"Well, we can't have it, so don't let us grumble but shoulder<br/>our bundles and trudge along as cheerfully as Marmee does. I'm sure<br/>Aunt March is a regular Old Man of the Sea to me, but I suppose<br/>when I've learned to carry her without complaining, she will tumble<br/>off, or get so light that I shan't mind her."<br/><br/>This idea tickled Jo's fancy and put her in good spirits, but<br/>Meg didn't brighten, for her burden, consisting of four spoiled<br/>children, seemed heavier than ever. She had not heart enough even<br/>to make herself pretty as usual by putting on a blue neck ribbon<br/>and dressing her hair in the most becoming way.<br/><br/>"Where's the use of looking nice, when no one sees me but those<br/>cross midgets, and no one cares whether I'm pretty or not?" she<br/>muttered, shutting her drawer with a jerk. "I shall have to toil<br/>and moil all my days, with only little bits of fun now and then,<br/>and get old and ugly and sour, because I'm poor and can't enjoy my<br/>life as other girls do. It's a shame!"<br/><br/>So Meg went down, wearing an injured look, and wasn't at all<br/>agreeable at breakfast time. Everyone seemed rather out of sorts<br/>and inclined to croak.<br/>
