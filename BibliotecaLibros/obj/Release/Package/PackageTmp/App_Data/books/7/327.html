<br/>She said nothing at first, for she liked to hear him laugh out<br/>his big, hearty laugh when anything funny happened, so she left him<br/>to discover it for himself, and presently forgot all about it, for<br/>to hear a German read Schiller is rather an absorbing occupation.<br/>After the reading came the lesson, which was a lively one, for Jo<br/>was in a gay mood that night, and the cocked hat kept her eyes<br/>dancing with merriment. The Professor didn't know what to make of<br/>her, and stopped at last to ask with an air of mild surprise that<br/>was irresistible…<br/><br/>"Mees Marsch, for what do you laugh in your master's face? Haf<br/>you no respect for me, that you go on so bad?"<br/><br/>"How can I be respectful, Sir, when you forget to take your hat<br/>off?" said Jo.<br/><br/>Lifting his hand to his head, the absent-minded Professor<br/>gravely felt and removed the little cocked hat, looked at it a<br/>minute, and then threw back his head and laughed like a merry bass<br/>viol.<br/><br/>"Ah! I see him now, it is that imp Tina who makes me a fool with<br/>my cap. Well, it is nothing, but see you, if this lesson goes not<br/>well, you too shall wear him."<br/><br/>But the lesson did not go at all for a few minutes because Mr.<br/>Bhaer caught sight of a picture on the hat, and unfolding it, said<br/>with great disgust, "I wish these papers did not come in the house.<br/>They are not for children to see, nor young people to read. It is<br/>not well, and I haf no patience with those who make this harm."<br/><br/>Jo glanced at the sheet and saw a pleasing illustration composed<br/>of a lunatic, a corpse, a villain, and a viper. She did not like<br/>it, but the impulse that made her turn it over was not one of<br/>displeasure but fear, because for a minute she fancied the paper<br/>was the Volcano. It was not, however, and her panic subsided as she<br/>remembered that even if it had been and one of her own tales in it,<br/>there would have been no name to betray her. She had betrayed<br/>herself, however, by a look and a blush, for though an absent man,<br/>the Professor saw a good deal more than people fancied. He knew<br/>that Jo wrote, and had met her down among the newspaper offices<br/>more than once, but as she never spoke of it, he asked no questions<br/>in spite of a strong desire to see her work. Now it occurred to him<br/>that she was doing what she was ashamed to own, and it troubled<br/>him. He did not say to himself, "It is none of my business. I've no<br/>right to say anything," as many people would have done. He only<br/>remembered that she was young and poor, a girl far away from<br/>mother's love and father's care, and he was moved to help her with<br/>an impulse as quick and natural as that which would prompt him to<br/>put out his hand to save a baby from a puddle. All this flashed<br/>through his mind in a minute, but not a trace of it appeared in his<br/>face, and by the time the paper was turned, and Jo's needle<br/>threaded, he was ready to say quite naturally, but very<br/>gravely…<br/><br/>"Yes, you are right to put it from you. I do not think that good<br/>young girls should see such things. They are made pleasant to some,<br/>but I would more rather give my boys gunpowder to play with than<br/>this bad trash."<br/><br/>"All may not be bad, only silly, you know, and if there is a<br/>demand for it, I don't see any harm in supplying it. Many very<br/>respectable people make an honest living out of what are called<br/>sensation stories," said Jo, scratching gathers so energetically<br/>that a row of little slits followed her pin.<br/><br/>"There is a demand for whisky, but I think you and I do not care<br/>to sell it. If the respectable people knew what harm they did, they<br/>would not feel that the living was honest. They haf no right to put<br/>poison in the sugarplum, and let the small ones eat it. No, they<br/>should think a little, and sweep mud in the street before they do<br/>this thing."<br/><br/>
