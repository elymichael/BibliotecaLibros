<br/>"Don't be sorry, I won't let it hurt me. I'll forget all the bad<br/>and remember only the good, for I did enjoy a great deal, and thank<br/>you very much for letting me go. I'll not be sentimental or<br/>dissatisfied, Mother. I know I'm a silly little girl, and I'll stay<br/>with you till I'm fit to take care of myself. But it is nice to be<br/>praised and admired, and I can't help saying I like it," said Meg,<br/>looking half ashamed of the confession.<br/><br/>"That is perfectly natural, and quite harmless, if the liking<br/>does not become a passion and lead one to do foolish or unmaidenly<br/>things. Learn to know and value the praise which is worth having,<br/>and to excite the admiration of excellent people by being modest as<br/>well as pretty, Meg."<br/><br/>Margaret sat thinking a moment, while Jo stood with her hands<br/>behind her, looking both interested and a little perplexed, for it<br/>was a new thing to see Meg blushing and talking about admiration,<br/>lovers, and things of that sort. And Jo felt as if during that<br/>fortnight her sister had grown up amazingly, and was drifting away<br/>from her into a world where she could not follow.<br/><br/>"Mother, do you have 'plans', as Mrs. Moffat said?" asked Meg<br/>bashfully.<br/><br/>"Yes, my dear, I have a great many, all mothers do, but mine<br/>differ somewhat from Mrs. Moffat's, I suspect. I will tell you some<br/>of them, for the time has come when a word may set this romantic<br/>little head and heart of yours right, on a very serious subject.<br/>You are young, Meg, but not too young to understand me, and<br/>mothers' lips are the fittest to speak of such things to girls like<br/>you. Jo, your turn will come in time, perhaps, so listen to my<br/>'plans' and help me carry them out, if they are good."<br/><br/>Jo went and sat on one arm of the chair, looking as if she<br/>thought they were about to join in some very solemn affair. Holding<br/>a hand of each, and watching the two young faces wistfully, Mrs.<br/>March said, in her serious yet cheery wayâ€¦<br/><br/>"I want my daughters to be beautiful, accomplished, and good. To<br/>be admired, loved, and respected. To have a happy youth, to be well<br/>and wisely married, and to lead useful, pleasant lives, with as<br/>little care and sorrow to try them as God sees fit to send. To be<br/>loved and chosen by a good man is the best and sweetest thing which<br/>can happen to a woman, and I sincerely hope my girls may know this<br/>beautiful experience. It is natural to think of it, Meg, right to<br/>hope and wait for it, and wise to prepare for it, so that when the<br/>happy time comes, you may feel ready for the duties and worthy of<br/>the joy. My dear girls, I am ambitious for you, but not to have you<br/>make a dash in the world, marry rich men merely because they are<br/>rich, or have splendid houses, which are not homes because love is<br/>wanting. Money is a needful and precious thing, and when well used,<br/>a noble thing, but I never want you to think it is the first or<br/>only prize to strive for. I'd rather see you poor men's wives, if<br/>you were happy, beloved, contented, than queens on thrones, without<br/>self-respect and peace."<br/><br/>"Poor girls don't stand any chance, Belle says, unless they put<br/>themselves forward," sighed Meg.<br/><br/>"Then we'll be old maids," said Jo stoutly.<br/><br/>"Right, Jo. Better be happy old maids than unhappy wives, or<br/>unmaidenly girls, running about to find husbands," said Mrs. March<br/>decidedly. "Don't be troubled, Meg, poverty seldom daunts a sincere<br/>lover. Some of the best and most honored women I know were poor<br/>girls, but so love-worthy that they were not allowed to be old<br/>maids. Leave these things to time. Make this home happy, so that<br/>you may be fit for homes of your own, if they are offered you, and<br/>contented here if they are not. One thing remember, my girls.<br/>Mother is always ready to be your confidant, Father to be your<br/>friend, and both of us hope and trust that our daughters, whether<br/>married or single, will be the pride and comfort of our lives."<br/><br/>
