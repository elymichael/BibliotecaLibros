<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>21<br/>My Lord and Lady<br/><br/><br/>"Please, Madam Mother, could you lend me my wife for half an<br/>hour? The luggage has come, and I've been making hay of Amy's Paris<br/>finery, trying to find some things I want," said Laurie, coming in<br/>the next day to find Mrs. Laurence sitting in her mother's lap, as<br/>if being made 'the baby' again.<br/><br/>"Certainly.

I suppose that's what<br/>you are rummaging after among my things. Men are so helpless,<br/>Mother," said Amy, with a matronly air, which delighted her<br/>husband.<br/><br/>"What are you going to do with yourselves after you get<br/>settled?" asked Jo, buttoning Amy's cloak as she used to button her<br/>pinafores.<br/>
