For never more by the fire she'll sit,<br/>Nor play by the old green gate.<br/><br/>The little grave where her infant sleeps<br/>Is 'neath the chestnut tree.<br/>But o'er her grave we may not weep,<br/>We know not where it may be.<br/><br/>Her empty bed, her idle ball,<br/>Will never see her more;<br/>No gentle tap, no loving purr<br/>Is heard at the parlor door.<br/><br/>Another cat comes after her mice,<br/>A cat with a dirty face,<br/>But she does not hunt as our darling did,<br/>Nor play with her airy grace.<br/><br/>Her stealthy paws tread the very hall<br/>Where Snowball used to play,<br/>But she only spits at the dogs our pet<br/>
