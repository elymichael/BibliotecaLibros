I felt angry at first, and then I didn't care,<br/>for a governess is as good as a clerk, and I've got sense, if I<br/>haven't style, which is more than some people have, judging from<br/>the remarks of the elegant beings who clattered away, smoking like<br/>bad chimneys. I hate ordinary people!<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Thursday<br/><br/>Yesterday was a quiet day spent in teaching,<br/>sewing, and writing in my little room, which is very cozy, with a<br/>light and fire. I picked up a few bits of news and was introduced<br/>to the Professor. It seems that Tina is the child of the<br/>Frenchwoman who does the fine ironing in the laundry here. The<br/>little thing has lost her heart to Mr. Bhaer, and follows him about<br/>the house like a dog whenever he is at home, which delights him, as<br/>he is very fond of children, though a 'bacheldore'. Kitty and<br/>Minnie Kirke likewise regard him with affection, and tell all sorts<br/>of stories about the plays he invents, the presents he brings, and<br/>the splendid tales he tells. The younger men quiz him, it seems,<br/>call him Old Fritz, Lager Beer, Ursa Major, and make all manner of<br/>jokes on his name. But he enjoys it like a boy, Mrs. Kirke says,<br/>and takes it so good-naturedly that they all like him in spite of<br/>his foreign ways.<br/><br/>The maiden lady is a Miss Norton, rich,<br/>cultivated, and kind. She spoke to me at dinner today (for I went<br/>to table again, it's such fun to watch people), and asked me to<br/>come and see her at her room. She has fine books and pictures,<br/>knows interesting persons, and seems friendly, so I shall make<br/>myself agreeable, for I do want to get into good society, only it<br/>isn't the same sort that Amy likes.<br/><br/>I was in our parlor last evening when Mr. Bhaer<br/>came in with some newspapers for Mrs. Kirke. She wasn't there, but<br/>Minnie, who is a little old woman, introduced me very prettily.<br/>"This is Mamma's friend, Miss March."<br/><br/>"Yes, and she's jolly and we like her lots,"<br/>added Kitty, who is an 'enfant terrible'.<br/><br/>We both bowed, and then we laughed, for the prim<br/>introduction and the blunt addition were rather a comical<br/>contrast.<br/><br/>"Ah, yes, I hear these naughty ones go to vex<br/>you, Mees Marsch. If so again, call at me and I come," he said,<br/>with a threatening frown that delighted the little wretches.<br/><br/>I promised I would, and he departed, but it seems<br/>as if I was doomed to see a good deal of him, for today as I passed<br/>his door on my way out, by accident I knocked against it with my<br/>umbrella. It flew open, and there he stood in his dressing gown,<br/>with a big blue sock on one hand and a darning needle in the other.<br/>He didn't seem at all ashamed of it, for when I explained and<br/>hurried on, he waved his hand, sock and all, saying in his loud,<br/>cheerful wayâ€¦<br/><br/>"You haf a fine day to make your walk. Bon<br/>voyage, Mademoiselle."<br/>
