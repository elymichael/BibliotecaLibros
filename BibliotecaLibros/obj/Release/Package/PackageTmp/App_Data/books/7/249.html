<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>2<br/>The First Wedding<br/><br/><br/>The June roses over the porch were awake bright and early on<br/>that morning, rejoicing with all their hearts in the cloudless<br/>sunshine, like friendly little neighbors, as they were. Quite<br/>flushed with excitement were their ruddy faces, as they swung in<br/>the wind, whispering to one another what they had seen, for some<br/>peeped in at the dining room windows where the feast was spread,<br/>some climbed up to nod and smile at the sisters as they dressed the<br/>bride, others waved a welcome to those who came and went on various<br/>errands in garden, porch, and hall, and all, from the rosiest<br/>full-blown flower to the palest baby bud, offered their tribute of<br/>beauty and fragrance to the gentle mistress who had loved and<br/>tended them so long.<br/><br/>Meg looked very like a rose herself, for all that was best and<br/>sweetest in heart and soul seemed to bloom into her face that day,<br/>making it fair and tender, with a charm more beautiful than beauty.<br/>Neither silk, lace, nor orange flowers would she have. "I don't<br/>want a fashionable wedding, but only those about me whom I love,<br/>and to them I wish to look and be my familiar self."<br/><br/>So she made her wedding gown herself, sewing into it the tender<br/>hopes and innocent romances of a girlish heart. Her sisters braided<br/>up her pretty hair, and the only ornaments she wore were the lilies<br/>of the valley, which 'her John' liked best of all the flowers that<br/>grew.<br/><br/>"You do look just like our own dear Meg, only so very sweet and<br/>lovely that I should hug you if it wouldn't crumple your dress,"<br/>cried Amy, surveying her with delight when all was done.<br/><br/>"Then I am satisfied. But please hug and kiss me, everyone, and<br/>don't mind my dress. I want a great many crumples of this sort put<br/>into it today," and Meg opened her arms to her sisters, who clung<br/>about her with April faces for a minute, feeling that the new love<br/>had not changed the old.<br/><br/>"Now I'm going to tie John's cravat for him, and then to stay a<br/>few minutes with Father quietly in the study," and Meg ran down to<br/>perform these little ceremonies, and then to follow her mother<br/>wherever she went, conscious that in spite of the smiles on the<br/>motherly face, there was a secret sorrow hid in the motherly heart<br/>at the flight of the first bird from the nest.<br/><br/>As the younger girls stand together, giving the last touches to<br/>their simple toilet, it may be a good time to tell of a few changes<br/>which three years have wrought in their appearance, for all are<br/>looking their best just now.<br/>
