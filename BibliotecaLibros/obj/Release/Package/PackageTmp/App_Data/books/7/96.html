<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>10<br/>The P.C. and P.O.<br/><br/><br/>As spring came on, a new set of amusements became the fashion,<br/>and the lengthening days gave long afternoons for work and play of<br/>all sorts. The garden had to be put in order, and each sister had a<br/>quarter of the little plot to do what she liked with. Hannah used<br/>to say, "I'd know which each of them gardings belonged to, ef I see<br/>'em in Chiny," and so she might, for the girls' tastes differed as<br/>much as their characters. Meg's had roses and heliotrope, myrtle,<br/>and a little orange tree in it. Jo's bed was never alike two<br/>seasons, for she was always trying experiments. This year it was to<br/>be a plantation of sun flowers, the seeds of which cheerful land<br/>aspiring plant were to feed Aunt Cockle-top and her family of<br/>chicks. Beth had old-fashioned fragrant flowers in her garden,<br/>sweet peas and mignonette, larkspur, pinks, pansies, and<br/>southernwood, with chickweed for the birds and catnip for the<br/>pussies. Amy had a bower in hers, rather small and earwiggy, but<br/>very pretty to look at, with honeysuckle and morning-glories<br/>hanging their colored horns and bells in graceful wreaths all over<br/>it, tall white lilies, delicate ferns, and as many brilliant,<br/>picturesque plants as would consent to blossom there.<br/><br/>Gardening, walks, rows on the river, and flower hunts employed<br/>the fine days, and for rainy ones, they had house diversions, some<br/>old, some new, all more or less original. One of these was the<br/>'P.C.', for as secret societies were the fashion, it was thought<br/>proper to have one, and as all of the girls admired Dickens, they<br/>called themselves the Pickwick Club. With a few interruptions, they<br/>had kept this up for a year, and met every Saturday evening in the<br/>big garret, on which occasions the ceremonies were as follows:<br/>Three chairs were arranged in a row before a table on which was a<br/>lamp, also four white badges, with a big 'P.C.' in different colors<br/>on each, and the weekly newspaper called, The Pickwick Portfolio,<br/>to which all contributed something, while Jo, who reveled in pens<br/>and ink, was the editor. At seven o'clock, the four members<br/>ascended to the clubroom, tied their badges round their heads, and<br/>took their seats with great solemnity. Meg, as the eldest, was<br/>Samuel Pickwick, Jo, being of a literary turn, Augustus Snodgrass,<br/>Beth, because she was round and rosy, Tracy Tupman, and Amy, who<br/>was always trying to do what she couldn't, was Nathaniel Winkle.<br/>Pickwick, the president, read the paper, which was filled with<br/>original tales, poetry, local news, funny advertisements, and<br/>hints, in which they good-naturedly reminded each other of their<br/>faults and short comings. On one occasion, Mr. Pickwick put on a<br/>pair of spectacles without any glass, rapped upon the table,<br/>hemmed, and having stared hard at Mr. Snodgrass, who was tilting<br/>back in his chair, till he arranged himself properly, began to<br/>read:<br/><br/><br/>"THE PICKWICK PORTFOLIO"<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>MAY 20, 18â€”<br/><br/>POET'S CORNER<br/><br/>
