"It's not the fashion, but it's becoming, and I can't afford to<br/>make a fright of myself," she used to say, when advised to frizzle,<br/>puff, or braid, as the latest style commanded.<br/><br/>Having no ornaments fine enough for this important occasion, Amy<br/>looped her fleecy skirts with rosy clusters of azalea, and framed<br/>the white shoulders in delicate green vines. Remembering the<br/>painted boots, she surveyed her white satin slippers with girlish<br/>satisfaction, and chassed down the room, admiring her aristocratic<br/>feet all by herself.<br/><br/>"My new fan just matches my flowers, my gloves fit to a charm,<br/>and the real lace on Aunt's mouchoir gives an air to my whole<br/>dress. If I only had a classical nose and mouth I should be<br/>perfectly happy," she said, surveying herself with a critical eye<br/>and a candle in each hand.<br/><br/>In spite of this affliction, she looked unusually gay and<br/>graceful as she glided away. She seldom ranâ€”it did not suit her<br/>style, she thought, for being tall, the stately and Junoesque was<br/>more appropriate than the sportive or piquante. She walked up and<br/>down the long saloon while waiting for Laurie, and once arranged<br/>herself under the chandelier, which had a good effect upon her<br/>hair, then she thought better of it, and went away to the other end<br/>of the room, as if ashamed of the girlish desire to have the first<br/>view a propitious one. It so happened that she could not have done<br/>a better thing, for Laurie came in so quietly she did not hear him,<br/>and as she stood at the distant window, with her head half turned<br/>and one hand gathering up her dress, the slender, white figure<br/>against the red curtains was as effective as a well-placed<br/>statue.<br/><br/>"Good evening, Diana!" said Laurie, with the look of<br/>satisfaction she liked to see in his eyes when they rested on<br/>her.<br/><br/>"Good evening, Apollo!" she answered, smiling back at him, for<br/>he too looked unusually debonair, and the thought of entering the<br/>ballroom on the arm of such a personable man caused Amy to pity the<br/>four plain Misses Davis from the bottom of her heart.<br/><br/>"Here are your flowers. I arranged them myself, remembering that<br/>you didn't like what Hannah calls a 'sot-bookay'," said Laurie,<br/>handing her a delicate nosegay, in a holder that she had long<br/>coveted as she daily passed it in Cardiglia's window.<br/><br/>"How kind you are!" she exclaimed gratefully. "If I'd known you<br/>were coming I'd have had something ready for you today, though not<br/>as pretty as this, I'm afraid."<br/><br/>"Thank you. It isn't what it should be, but you have improved<br/>it," he added, as she snapped the silver bracelet on her wrist.<br/><br/>"Please don't."<br/><br/>"I thought you liked that sort of thing."<br/>
