<br/>"He's my child, and I won't have his temper spoiled by<br/>indulgence. Go down, my dear, and leave the boy to me."<br/><br/>When John spoke in that masterful tone, Meg always obeyed, and<br/>never regretted her docility.<br/><br/>"Please let me kiss him once, John?"<br/><br/>"Certainly. Demi, say good night to Mamma, and let her go and<br/>rest, for she is very tired with taking care of you all day."<br/><br/>Meg always insisted upon it that the kiss won the victory, for<br/>after it was given, Demi sobbed more quietly, and lay quite still<br/>at the bottom of the bed, whither he had wriggled in his anguish of<br/>mind.<br/><br/>"Poor little man, he's worn out with sleep and crying. I'll<br/>cover him up, and then go and set Meg's heart at rest," thought<br/>John, creeping to the bedside, hoping to find his rebellious heir<br/>asleep.<br/><br/>But he wasn't, for the moment his father peeped at him, Demi's<br/>eyes opened, his little chin began to quiver, and he put up his<br/>arms, saying with a penitent hiccough, "Me's dood, now."<br/><br/>Sitting on the stairs outside Meg wondered at the long silence<br/>which followed the uproar, and after imagining all sorts of<br/>impossible accidents, she slipped into the room to set her fears at<br/>rest. Demi lay fast asleep, not in his usual spreadeagle attitude,<br/>but in a subdued bunch, cuddled close in the circle of his father's<br/>arm and holding his father's finger, as if he felt that justice was<br/>tempered with mercy, and had gone to sleep a sadder and wiser baby.<br/>So held, John had waited with a womanly patience till the little<br/>hand relaxed its hold, and while waiting had fallen asleep, more<br/>tired by that tussle with his son than with his whole day's<br/>work.<br/><br/>As Meg stood watching the two faces on the pillow, she smiled to<br/>herself, and then slipped away again, saying in a satisfied tone,<br/>"I never need fear that John will be too harsh with my babies. He<br/>does know how to manage them, and will be a great help, for Demi is<br/>getting too much for me."<br/><br/>When John came down at last, expecting to find a pensive or<br/>reproachful wife, he was agreeably surprised to find Meg placidly<br/>trimming a bonnet, and to be greeted with the request to read<br/>something about the election, if he was not too tired. John saw in<br/>a minute that a revolution of some kind was going on, but wisely<br/>asked no questions, knowing that Meg was such a transparent little<br/>person, she couldn't keep a secret to save her life, and therefore<br/>the clue would soon appear. He read a long debate with the most<br/>amiable readiness and then explained it in his most lucid manner,<br/>while Meg tried to look deeply interested, to ask intelligent<br/>questions, and keep her thoughts from wandering from the state of<br/>the nation to the state of her bonnet. In her secret soul, however,<br/>she decided that politics were as bad as mathematics, and that the<br/>mission of politicians seemed to be calling each other names, but<br/>she kept these feminine ideas to herself, and when John paused,<br/>shook her head and said with what she thought diplomatic ambiguity,<br/>"Well, I really don't see what we are coming to."<br/><br/>
