It was not at all romantic, but a hearty laugh set everybody<br/>straight again, for Hannah was discovered behind the door, sobbing<br/>over the fat turkey, which she had forgotten to put down when she<br/>rushed up from the kitchen. As the laugh subsided, Mrs. March began<br/>to thank Mr. Brooke for his faithful care of her husband, at which<br/>Mr. Brooke suddenly remembered that Mr. March needed rest, and<br/>seizing Laurie, he precipitately retired. Then the two invalids<br/>were ordered to repose, which they did, by both sitting in one big<br/>chair and talking hard.<br/><br/>Mr. March told how he had longed to surprise them, and how, when<br/>the fine weather came, he had been allowed by his doctor to take<br/>advantage of it, how devoted Brooke had been, and how he was<br/>altogether a most estimable and upright young man. Why Mr. March<br/>paused a minute just there, and after a glance at Meg, who was<br/>violently poking the fire, looked at his wife with an inquiring<br/>lift of the eyebrows, I leave you to imagine. Also why Mrs. March<br/>gently nodded her head and asked, rather abruptly, if he wouldn't<br/>like to have something to eat. Jo saw and understood the look, and<br/>she stalked grimly away to get wine and beef tea, muttering to<br/>herself as she slammed the door, "I hate estimable young men with<br/>brown eyes!"<br/><br/>There never was such a Christmas dinner as they had that day.<br/>The fat turkey was a sight to behold, when Hannah sent him up,<br/>stuffed, browned, and decorated. So was the plum pudding, which<br/>melted in one's mouth, likewise the jellies, in which Amy reveled<br/>like a fly in a honeypot. Everything turned out well, which was a<br/>mercy, Hannah said, "For my mind was that flustered, Mum, that it's<br/>a merrycle I didn't roast the pudding, and stuff the turkey with<br/>raisins, let alone bilin' of it in a cloth."<br/><br/>Mr. Laurence and his grandson dined with them, also Mr. Brooke,<br/>at whom Jo glowered darkly, to Laurie's infinite amusement. Two<br/>easy chairs stood side by side at the head of the table, in which<br/>sat Beth and her father, feasting modestly on chicken and a little<br/>fruit. They drank healths, told stories, sang songs, 'reminisced',<br/>as the old folks say, and had a thoroughly good time. A sleigh ride<br/>had been planned, but the girls would not leave their father, so<br/>the guests departed early, and as twilight gathered, the happy<br/>family sat together round the fire.<br/><br/>"Just a year ago we were groaning over the dismal Christmas we<br/>expected to have. Do you remember?" asked Jo, breaking a short<br/>pause which had followed a long conversation about many things.<br/><br/>"Rather a pleasant year on the whole!" said Meg, smiling at the<br/>fire, and congratulating herself on having treated Mr. Brooke with<br/>dignity.<br/><br/>"I think it's been a pretty hard one," observed Amy, watching<br/>the light shine on her ring with thoughtful eyes.<br/><br/>"I'm glad it's over, because we've got you back," whispered<br/>Beth, who sat on her father's knee.<br/><br/>"Rather a rough road for you to travel, my little pilgrims,<br/>especially the latter part of it. But you have got on bravely, and<br/>I think the burdens are in a fair way to tumble off very soon,"<br/>said Mr. March, looking with fatherly satisfaction at the four<br/>young faces gathered round him.<br/><br/>"How do you know? Did Mother tell you?" asked Jo.<br/><br/>"Not much. Straws show which way the wind blows, and I've made<br/>several discoveries today."<br/>
