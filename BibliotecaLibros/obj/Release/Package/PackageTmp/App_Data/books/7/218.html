"So am I, but a kind word will govern me when all the king's<br/>horses and all the king's men couldn't," said Jo, trying to say a<br/>kind word for her friend, who seemed to get out of one scrape only<br/>to fall into another.<br/><br/>"You think I'm not kind to him, hey?" was the sharp answer.<br/><br/>"Oh, dear no, Sir. You are rather too kind sometimes, and then<br/>just a trifle hasty when he tries your patience. Don't you think<br/>you are?"<br/><br/>Jo was determined to have it out now, and tried to look quite<br/>placid, though she quaked a little after her bold speech. To her<br/>great relief and surprise, the old gentleman only threw his<br/>spectacles onto the table with a rattle and exclaimed frankly,<br/>"You're right, girl, I am! I love the boy, but he tries my patience<br/>past bearing, and I know how it will end, if we go on so."<br/><br/>"I'll tell you, he'll run away." Jo was sorry for that speech<br/>the minute it was made. She meant to warn him that Laurie would not<br/>bear much restraint, and hoped he would be more forebearing with<br/>the lad.<br/><br/>Mr. Laurence's ruddy face changed suddenly, and he sat down,<br/>with a troubled glance at the picture of a handsome man, which hung<br/>over his table. It was Laurie's father, who had run away in his<br/>youth, and married against the imperious old man's will. Jo fancied<br/>he remembered and regretted the past, and she wished she had held<br/>her tongue.<br/><br/>"He won't do it unless he is very much worried, and only<br/>threatens it sometimes, when he gets tired of studying. I often<br/>think I should like to, especially since my hair was cut, so if you<br/>ever miss us, you may advertise for two boys and look among the<br/>ships bound for India."<br/><br/>She laughed as she spoke, and Mr. Laurence looked relieved,<br/>evidently taking the whole as a joke.<br/><br/>"You hussy, how dare you talk in that way? Where's your respect<br/>for me, and your proper bringing up? Bless the boys and girls! What<br/>torments they are, yet we can't do without them," he said, pinching<br/>her cheeks good-humoredly. "Go and bring that boy down to his<br/>dinner, tell him it's all right, and advise him not to put on<br/>tragedy airs with his grandfather. I won't bear it."<br/><br/>"He won't come, Sir. He feels badly because you didn't believe<br/>him when he said he couldn't tell. I think the shaking hurt his<br/>feelings very much."<br/><br/>Jo tried to look pathetic but must have failed, for Mr. Laurence<br/>began to laugh, and she knew the day was won.<br/>
