"It's no use trying to argue with you," began Amy.<br/><br/>"Not the least, my dear," interrupted Jo, "so let us look<br/>amiable, and drop a card here, as the Kings are evidently out, for<br/>which I'm deeply grateful."<br/><br/>The family cardcase having done its duty the girls walked on,<br/>and Jo uttered another thanksgiving on reaching the fifth house,<br/>and being told that the young ladies were engaged.<br/><br/>"Now let us go home, and never mind Aunt March today. We can run<br/>down there any time, and it's really a pity to trail through the<br/>dust in our best bibs and tuckers, when we are tired and<br/>cross."<br/><br/>"Speak for yourself, if you please. Aunt March likes to have us<br/>pay her the compliment of coming in style, and making a formal<br/>call. It's a little thing to do, but it gives her pleasure, and I<br/>don't believe it will hurt your things half so much as letting<br/>dirty dogs and clumping boys spoil them. Stoop down, and let me<br/>take the crumbs off of your bonnet."<br/><br/>"What a good girl you are, Amy!" said Jo, with a repentant<br/>glance from her own damaged costume to that of her sister, which<br/>was fresh and spotless still. "I wish it was as easy for me to do<br/>little things to please people as it is for you. I think of them,<br/>but it takes too much time to do them, so I wait for a chance to<br/>confer a great favor, and let the small ones slip, but they tell<br/>best in the end, I fancy."<br/><br/>Amy smiled and was mollified at once, saying with a maternal<br/>air, "Women should learn to be agreeable, particularly poor ones,<br/>for they have no other way of repaying the kindnesses they receive.<br/>If you'd remember that, and practice it, you'd be better liked than<br/>I am, because there is more of you."<br/><br/>"I'm a crotchety old thing, and always shall be, but I'm willing<br/>to own that you are right, only it's easier for me to risk my life<br/>for a person than to be pleasant to him when I don't feel like it.<br/>It's a great misfortune to have such strong likes and dislikes,<br/>isn't it?"<br/><br/>"It's a greater not to be able to hide them. I don't mind saying<br/>that I don't approve of Tudor any more than you do, but I'm not<br/>called upon to tell him so. Neither are you, and there is no use in<br/>making yourself disagreeable because he is."<br/><br/>"But I think girls ought to show when they disapprove of young<br/>men, and how can they do it except by their manners? Preaching does<br/>not do any good, as I know to my sorrow, since I've had Teddie to<br/>manage. But there are many little ways in which I can influence him<br/>without a word, and I say we ought to do it to others if we<br/>can."<br/><br/>"Teddy is a remarkable boy, and can't be taken as a sample of<br/>other boys," said Amy, in a tone of solemn conviction, which would<br/>have convulsed the 'remarkable boy' if he had heard it. "If we were<br/>belles, or women of wealth and position, we might do something,<br/>perhaps, but for us to frown at one set of young gentlemen because<br/>we don't approve of them, and smile upon another set because we do,<br/>wouldn't have a particle of effect, and we should only be<br/>considered odd and puritanical."<br/>
