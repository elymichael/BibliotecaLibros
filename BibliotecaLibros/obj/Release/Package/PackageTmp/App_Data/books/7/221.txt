Pleasant Meadows


Like sunshine after a storm were the peaceful weeks which
followed. The invalids improved rapidly, and Mr. March began to
talk of returning early in the new year. Beth was soon able to lie
on the study sofa all day, amusing herself with the well-beloved
cats at first, and in time with doll's sewing, which had fallen
sadly behind-hand. Her once active limbs were so stiff and feeble
that Jo took her for a daily airing about the house in her strong
arms. Meg cheerfully blackened and burned her white hands cooking
delicate messes for 'the dear', while Amy, a loyal slave of the
ring, celebrated her return by giving away as many of her treasures
as she could prevail on her sisters to accept.

As Christmas approached, the usual mysteries began to haunt the
house, and Jo frequently convulsed the family by proposing utterly
impossible or magnificently absurd ceremonies, in honor of this
unusually merry Christmas. Laurie was equally impracticable, and
would have had bonfires, skyrockets, and triumphal arches, if he
had had his own way. After many skirmishes and snubbings, the
ambitious pair were considered effectually quenched and went about
with forlorn faces, which were rather belied by explosions of
laughter when the two got together.

Several days of unusually mild weather fitly ushered in a
splendid Christmas Day. Hannah 'felt in her bones' that it was
going to be an unusually fine day, and she proved herself a true
prophetess, for everybody and everything seemed bound to produce a
grand success. To begin with, Mr. March wrote that he should soon
be with them, then Beth felt uncommonly well that morning, and,
being dressed in her mother's gift, a soft crimson merino wrapper,
was borne in high triumph to the window to behold the offering of
Jo and Laurie. The Unquenchables had done their best to be worthy
of the name, for like elves they had worked by night and conjured
up a comical surprise. Out in the garden stood a stately snow
maiden, crowned with holly, bearing a basket of fruit and flowers
in one hand, a great roll of music in the other, a perfect rainbow
of an Afghan round her chilly shoulders, and a Christmas carol
issuing from her lips on a pink paper streamer.


THE JUNGFRAU TO BETH

God bless you, dear Queen Bess!
May nothing you dismay,
But health and peace and happiness
Be yours, this Christmas day.
