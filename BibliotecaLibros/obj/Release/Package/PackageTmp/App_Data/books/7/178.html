<br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Ma Chere Mamma,<br/><br/>We are all well I do my lessons always and never<br/>corroberate the girls—Meg says I mean contradick so I put in both<br/>words and you can take the properest. Meg is a great comfort to me<br/>and lets me have jelly every night at tea its so good for me Jo<br/>says because it keeps me sweet tempered. Laurie is not as<br/>respeckful as he ought to be now I am almost in my teens, he calls<br/>me Chick and hurts my feelings by talking French to me very fast<br/>when I say Merci or Bon jour as Hattie King does. The sleeves of my<br/>blue dress were all worn out, and Meg put in new ones, but the full<br/>front came wrong and they are more blue than the dress. I felt bad<br/>but did not fret I bear my troubles well but I do wish Hannah would<br/>put more starch in my aprons and have buckwheats every day. Can't<br/>she? Didn't I make that interrigation point nice? Meg says my<br/>punchtuation and spelling are disgraceful and I am mortyfied but<br/>dear me I have so many things to do, I can't stop. Adieu, I send<br/>heaps of love to Papa. Your affectionate daughter…<br/><br/>AMY CURTIS MARCH<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Dear Mis March,<br/><br/>I jes drop a line to say we git on fust rate. The<br/>girls is clever and fly round right smart. Miss Meg is going to<br/>make a proper good housekeeper. She hes the liking for it, and gits<br/>the hang of things surprisin quick. Jo doos beat all for goin<br/>ahead, but she don't stop to cal'k'late fust, and you never know<br/>where she's like to bring up. She done out a tub of clothes on<br/>Monday, but she starched 'em afore they was wrenched, and blued a<br/>pink calico dress till I thought I should a died a laughin. Beth is<br/>the best of little creeters, and a sight of help to me, bein so<br/>forehanded and dependable. She tries to learn everything, and<br/>really goes to market beyond her years, likewise keeps accounts,<br/>with my help, quite wonderful. We have got on very economical so<br/>fur. I don't let the girls hev coffee only once a week, accordin to<br/>your wish, and keep em on plain wholesome vittles. Amy does well<br/>without frettin, wearin her best clothes and eatin sweet stuff. Mr.<br/>Laurie is as full of didoes as usual, and turns the house upside<br/>down frequent, but he heartens the girls, so I let em hev full<br/>swing. The old gentleman sends heaps of things, and is rather<br/>wearin, but means wal, and it aint my place to say nothin. My bread<br/>is riz, so no more at this time. I send my duty to Mr. March, and<br/>hope he's seen the last of his Pewmonia.<br/><br/>Yours respectful,&#160;<br/>Hannah Mullet<br/><br/>Head Nurse of Ward No. 2,&#160;<br/><br/>All serene on the Rappahannock, troops in fine condition, commisary<br/>department well conducted, the Home Guard under Colonel Teddy<br/>always on duty, Commander in Chief General Laurence reviews the<br/>army daily, Quartermaster Mullet keeps order in camp, and Major<br/>Lion does picket duty at night. A salute of twenty-four guns was<br/>fired on reciept of good news from Washington, and a dress parade<br/>took place at headquarters. Commander in chief sends best wishes,<br/>in which he is heartily joined by… &#160;<br/>
