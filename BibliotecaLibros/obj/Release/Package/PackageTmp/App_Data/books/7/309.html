"I know it. I'll tell you by-and-by."<br/><br/>"Is the pain better now?"<br/><br/>"Oh, yes, much better, you are so comfortable, Jo."<br/><br/>"Go to sleep, dear. I'll stay with you."<br/><br/>So cheek to cheek they fell asleep, and on the morrow Beth<br/>seemed quite herself again, for at eighteen neither heads nor<br/>hearts ache long, and a loving word can medicine most ills.<br/><br/>But Jo had made up her mind, and after pondering over a project<br/>for some days, she confided it to her mother.<br/><br/>"You asked me the other day what my wishes were. I'll tell you<br/>one of them, Marmee," she began, as they sat along together. "I<br/>want to go away somewhere this winter for a change."<br/><br/>"Why, Jo?" and her mother looked up quickly, as if the words<br/>suggested a double meaning.<br/><br/>With her eyes on her work Jo answered soberly, "I want something<br/>new. I feel restless and anxious to be seeing, doing, and learning<br/>more than I am. I brood too much over my own small affairs, and<br/>need stirring up, so as I can be spared this winter, I'd like to<br/>hop a little way and try my wings."<br/><br/>"Where will you hop?"<br/><br/>"To New York. I had a bright idea yesterday, and this is it. You<br/>know Mrs. Kirke wrote to you for some respectable young person to<br/>teach her children and sew. It's rather hard to find just the<br/>thing, but I think I should suit if I tried."<br/>
