<br/>With that, Jo shouldered her broom and marched into the house,<br/>wondering what they would all say to her. Laurie was in a flutter<br/>of excitement at the idea of having company, and flew about to get<br/>ready, for as Mrs. March said, he was 'a little gentleman', and did<br/>honor to the coming guest by brushing his curly pate, putting on a<br/>fresh color, and trying to tidy up the room, which in spite of half<br/>a dozen servants, was anything but neat. Presently there came a<br/>loud ring, than a decided voice, asking for 'Mr. Laurie', and a<br/>surprised-looking servant came running up to announce a young<br/>lady.<br/><br/>"All right, show her up, it's Miss Jo," said Laurie, going to<br/>the door of his little parlor to meet Jo, who appeared, looking<br/>rosy and quite at her ease, with a covered dish in one hand and<br/>Beth's three kittens in the other.<br/><br/>"Here I am, bag and baggage," she said briskly. "Mother sent her<br/>love, and was glad if I could do anything for you. Meg wanted me to<br/>bring some of her blanc mange, she makes it very nicely, and Beth<br/>thought her cats would be comforting. I knew you'd laugh at them,<br/>but I couldn't refuse, she was so anxious to do something."<br/><br/>It so happened that Beth's funny loan was just the thing, for in<br/>laughing over the kits, Laurie forgot his bashfulness, and grew<br/>sociable at once.<br/><br/>"That looks too pretty to eat," he said, smiling with pleasure,<br/>as Jo uncovered the dish, and showed the blanc mange, surrounded by<br/>a garland of green leaves, and the scarlet flowers of Amy's pet<br/>geranium.<br/><br/>"It isn't anything, only they all felt kindly and wanted to show<br/>it. Tell the girl to put it away for your tea. It's so simple you<br/>can eat it, and being soft, it will slip down without hurting your<br/>sore throat. What a cozy room this is!"<br/><br/>"It might be if it was kept nice, but the maids are lazy, and I<br/>don't know how to make them mind. It worries me though."<br/><br/>"I'll right it up in two minutes, for it only needs to have the<br/>hearth brushed, so—and the things made straight on the mantelpiece,<br/>so—and the books put here, and the bottles there, and your sofa<br/>turned from the light, and the pillows plumped up a bit. Now then,<br/>you're fixed."<br/><br/>And so he was, for, as she laughed and talked, Jo had whisked<br/>things into place and given quite a different air to the room.<br/>Laurie watched her in respectful silence, and when she beckoned him<br/>to his sofa, he sat down with a sigh of satisfaction, saying<br/>gratefully…<br/><br/>"How kind you are! Yes, that's what it wanted. Now please take<br/>the big chair and let me do something to amuse my company."<br/><br/>
