"Hum!" said Jo, with a sigh. "If you wish it you'll have it, for<br/>your wishes are always granted—mine never."<br/><br/>"Would you like to go?" asked Amy, thoughtfully patting her nose<br/>with her knife.<br/><br/>"Rather!"<br/><br/>"Well, in a year or two I'll send for you, and we'll dig in the<br/>Forum for relics, and carry out all the plans we've made so many<br/>times."<br/><br/>"Thank you. I'll remind you of your promise when that joyful day<br/>comes, if it ever does," returned Jo, accepting the vague but<br/>magnificent offer as gratefully as she could.<br/><br/>There was not much time for preparation, and the house was in a<br/>ferment till Amy was off. Jo bore up very well till the last<br/>flutter of blue ribbon vanished, when she retired to her refuge,<br/>the garret, and cried till she couldn't cry any more. Amy likewise<br/>bore up stoutly till the steamer sailed. Then just as the gangway<br/>was about to be withdrawn, it suddenly came over her that a whole<br/>ocean was soon to roll between her and those who loved her best,<br/>and she clung to Laurie, the last lingerer, saying with a sob…<br/><br/>"Oh, take care of them for me, and if anything should happen…<br/>"<br/><br/>"I will, dear, I will, and if anything happens, I'll come and<br/>comfort you," whispered Laurie, little dreaming that he would be<br/>called upon to keep his word.<br/><br/>So Amy sailed away to find the Old World, which is always new<br/>and beautiful to young eyes, while her father and friend watched<br/>her from the shore, fervently hoping that none but gentle fortunes<br/>would befall the happy-hearted girl, who waved her hand to them<br/>till they could see nothing but the summer sunshine dazzling on the<br/>sea.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
