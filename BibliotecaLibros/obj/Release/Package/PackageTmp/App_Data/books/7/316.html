<br/>Another knock and the appearance of two young<br/>ladies sent me back to my work, and there I virtuously remained<br/>through all the noise and gabbling that went on next door. One of<br/>the girls kept laughing affectedly, and saying, "Now Professor," in<br/>a coquettish tone, and the other pronounced her German with an<br/>accent that must have made it hard for him to keep sober.<br/><br/>Both seemed to try his patience sorely, for more<br/>than once I heard him say emphatically, "No, no, it is not so, you<br/>haf not attend to what I say," and once there was a loud rap, as if<br/>he struck the table with his book, followed by the despairing<br/>exclamation, "Prut! It all goes bad this day."<br/><br/>Poor man, I pitied him, and when the girls were<br/>gone, took just one more peep to see if he survived it. He seemed<br/>to have thrown himself back in his chair, tired out, and sat there<br/>with his eyes shut till the clock struck two, when he jumped up,<br/>put his books in his pocket, as if ready for another lesson, and<br/>taking little Tina who had fallen asleep on the sofa in his arms,<br/>he carried her quietly away. I fancy he has a hard life of it. Mrs.<br/>Kirke asked me if I wouldn't go down to the five o'clock dinner,<br/>and feeling a little bit homesick, I thought I would, just to see<br/>what sort of people are under the same roof with me. So I made<br/>myself respectable and tried to slip in behind Mrs. Kirke, but as<br/>she is short and I'm tall, my efforts at concealment were rather a<br/>failure. She gave me a seat by her, and after my face cooled off, I<br/>plucked up courage and looked about me. The long table was full,<br/>and every one intent on getting their dinner, the gentlemen<br/>especially, who seemed to be eating on time, for they bolted in<br/>every sense of the word, vanishing as soon as they were done. There<br/>was the usual assortment of young men absorbed in themselves, young<br/>couples absorbed in each other, married ladies in their babies, and<br/>old gentlemen in politics. I don't think I shall care to have much<br/>to do with any of them, except one sweetfaced maiden lady, who<br/>looks as if she had something in her.<br/><br/>Cast away at the very bottom of the table was the<br/>Professor, shouting answers to the questions of a very inquisitive,<br/>deaf old gentleman on one side, and talking philosophy with a<br/>Frenchman on the other. If Amy had been here, she'd have turned her<br/>back on him forever because, sad to relate, he had a great<br/>appetite, and shoveled in his dinner in a manner which would have<br/>horrified 'her ladyship'. I didn't mind, for I like 'to see folks<br/>eat with a relish', as Hannah says, and the poor man must have<br/>needed a deal of food after teaching idiots all day.<br/><br/>As I went upstairs after dinner, two of the young<br/>men were settling their hats before the hall mirror, and I heard<br/>one say low to the other, "Who's the new party?"<br/><br/>"Governess, or something of that sort."<br/><br/>"What the deuce is she at our table for?"<br/><br/>"Friend of the old lady's."<br/><br/>"Handsome head, but no style."<br/><br/>"Not a bit of it. Give us a light and come<br/>on."<br/><br/>
