<br/>"I have neither, and very few friends to care whether I live or<br/>die," said Mr. Brooke rather bitterly as he absently put the dead<br/>rose in the hole he had made and covered it up, like a little<br/>grave.<br/><br/>"Laurie and his grandfather would care a great deal, and we<br/>should all be very sorry to have any harm happen to you," said Meg<br/>heartily.<br/><br/>"Thank you, that sounds pleasant," began Mr. Brooke, looking<br/>cheerful again, but before he could finish his speech, Ned, mounted<br/>on the old horse, came lumbering up to display his equestrian skill<br/>before the young ladies, and there was no more quiet that day.<br/><br/>"Don't you love to ride?" asked Grace of Amy, as they stood<br/>resting after a race round the field with the others, led by<br/>Ned.<br/><br/>"I dote upon it.

It's very nice,<br/>for my friends go too, and the Row is full of ladies and<br/>gentlemen."<br/><br/>"Dear, how charming! I hope I shall go abroad some day, but I'd<br/>rather go to Rome than the Row," said Amy, who had not the remotest<br/>idea what the Row was and wouldn't have asked for the world.<br/><br/>Frank, sitting just behind the little girls, heard what they<br/>were saying, and pushed his crutch away from him with an impatient<br/>gesture as he watched the active lads going through all sorts of<br/>comical gymnastics. Beth, who was collecting the scattered Author<br/>cards, looked up and said, in her shy yet friendly way, "I'm afraid<br/>you are tired. Can I do anything for you?"<br/><br/>
