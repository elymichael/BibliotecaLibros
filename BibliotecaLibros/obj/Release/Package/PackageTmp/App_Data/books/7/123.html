<br/>Some english girls and boys are coming to see me<br/>tomorrow and I want to have a jolly time. If it's fine, I'm going<br/>to pitch my tent in Longmeadow, and row up the whole crew to lunch<br/>and croquetâ€”have a fire, make messes, gypsy fashion, and all sorts<br/>of larks. They are nice people, and like such things. Brooke will<br/>go to keep us boys steady, and Kate Vaughn will play propriety for<br/>the girls. I want you all to come, can't let Beth off at any price,<br/>and nobody shall worry her. Don't bother about rations, I'll see to<br/>that and everything else, only do come, there's a good fellow!<br/><br/>In a tearing hurry, Yours ever, Laurie.<br/><br/><br/>"Here's richness!" cried Jo, flying in to tell the news to<br/>Meg.<br/><br/>"Of course we can go, Mother? It will be such a help to Laurie,<br/>for I can row, and Meg see to the lunch, and the children be useful<br/>in some way."<br/><br/>"I hope the Vaughns are not fine grown-up people. Do you know<br/>anything about them, Jo?" asked Meg.<br/><br/>"Only that there are four of them. Kate is older than you, Fred<br/>and Frank (twins) about my age, and a little girl (Grace), who is<br/>nine or ten. Laurie knew them abroad, and liked the boys. I<br/>fancied, from the way he primmed up his mouth in speaking of her,<br/>that he didn't admire Kate much."<br/><br/>"I'm so glad my French print is clean, it's just the thing and<br/>so becoming!" observed Meg complacently. "Have you anything decent,<br/>Jo?"<br/><br/>"Scarlet and gray boating suit, good enough for me. I shall row<br/>and tramp about, so I don't want any starch to think of. You'll<br/>come, Betty?"<br/><br/>"If you won't let any boys talk to me."<br/><br/>"Not a boy!"<br/>
