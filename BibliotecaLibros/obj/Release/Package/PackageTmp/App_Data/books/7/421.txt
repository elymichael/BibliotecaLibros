"You are going, then?"

"I haf no longer any business here, it is done."

"Successfully, I hope?" said Jo, for the bitterness of
disappointment was in that short reply of his.

"I ought to think so, for I haf a way opened to me by which I
can make my bread and gif my Junglings much help."

"Tell me, please! I like to know all about the—the boys," said
Jo eagerly.

"That is so kind, I gladly tell you. My friends find for me a

him, she gave such a chilly, formal reply that despair fell upon
him. On learning his good fortune she almost clapped her hands. Was
the joy all for the boys? Then on hearing his destination, she
said, "So far away!" in a tone of despair that lifted him on to a
pinnacle of hope, but the next minute she tumbled him down again by
observing, like one entirely absorbed in the matter…
