"Little Raphael," as her sisters called her, had a decided<br/>talent for drawing, and was never so happy as when copying flowers,<br/>designing fairies, or illustrating stories with queer specimens of<br/>art. Her teachers complained that instead of doing her sums she<br/>covered her slate with animals, the blank pages of her atlas were<br/>used to copy maps on, and caricatures of the most ludicrous<br/>description came fluttering out of all her books at unlucky<br/>moments. She got through her lessons as well as she could, and<br/>managed to escape reprimands by being a model of deportment. She<br/>was a great favorite with her mates, being good-tempered and<br/>possessing the happy art of pleasing without effort. Her little<br/>airs and graces were much admired, so were her accomplishments, for<br/>besides her drawing, she could play twelve tunes, crochet, and read<br/>French without mispronouncing more than two-thirds of the words.<br/>She had a plaintive way of saying, "When Papa was rich we did<br/>so-and-so," which was very touching, and her long words were<br/>considered 'perfectly elegant' by the girls.<br/><br/>Amy was in a fair way to be spoiled, for everyone petted her,<br/>and her small vanities and selfishnesses were growing nicely. One<br/>thing, however, rather quenched the vanities. She had to wear her<br/>cousin's clothes. Now Florence's mama hadn't a particle of taste,<br/>and Amy suffered deeply at having to wear a red instead of a blue<br/>bonnet, unbecoming gowns, and fussy aprons that did not fit.<br/>Everything was good, well made, and little worn, but Amy's artistic<br/>eyes were much afflicted, especially this winter, when her school<br/>dress was a dull purple with yellow dots and no trimming.<br/><br/>"My only comfort," she said to Meg, with tears in her eyes, "is<br/>that Mother doesn't take tucks in my dresses whenever I'm naughty,<br/>as Maria Parks's mother does. My dear, it's really dreadful, for<br/>sometimes she is so bad her frock is up to her knees, and she can't<br/>come to school. When I think of this deggerredation, I feegorcer I<br/>can bear even my flat nose and purple gown with yellow skyrockets<br/>on it."<br/><br/>Meg was Amy's confidant and monitor, and by some strange<br/>attraction of opposites Jo was gentle Beth's. To Jo alone did the<br/>shy child tell her thoughts, and over her big harum-scarum sister<br/>Beth unconsciously exercised more influence than anyone in the<br/>family. The two older girls were a great deal to one another, but<br/>each took one of the younger sisters into her keeping and watched<br/>over her in her own way, 'playing mother' they called it, and put<br/>their sisters in the places of discarded dolls with the maternal<br/>instinct of little women.<br/><br/>"Has anybody got anything to tell? It's been such a dismal day<br/>I'm really dying for some amusement," said Meg, as they sat sewing<br/>together that evening.<br/><br/>"I had a queer time with Aunt today, and, as I got the best of<br/>it, I'll tell you about it," began Jo, who dearly loved to tell<br/>stories. "I was reading that everlasting Belsham, and droning away<br/>as I always do, for Aunt soon drops off, and then I take out some<br/>nice book, and read like fury till she wakes up. I actually made<br/>myself sleepy, and before she began to nod, I gave such a gape that<br/>she asked me what I meant by opening my mouth wide enough to take<br/>the whole book in at once."<br/><br/>"I wish I could, and be done with it," said I, trying not to be<br/>saucy.<br/><br/>"Then she gave me a long lecture on my sins, and told me to sit<br/>and think them over while she just 'lost' herself for a moment. She<br/>never finds herself very soon, so the minute her cap began to bob<br/>like a top-heavy dahlia, I whipped the&#160;<br/>Vicar of<br/>Wakefield<br/>&#160;out of my pocket, and read away, with one eye<br/>on him and one on Aunt. I'd just got to where they all tumbled into<br/>the water when I forgot and laughed out loud. Aunt woke up and,<br/>being more good-natured after her nap, told me to read a bit and<br/>show what frivolous work I preferred to the worthy and instructive<br/>Belsham. I did my very best, and she liked it, though she only<br/>saidâ€¦<br/><br/>"'I don't understand what it's all about. Go back and begin it,<br/>child.'"<br/><br/>"Back I went, and made the Primroses as interesting as ever I<br/>could. Once I was wicked enough to stop in a thrilling place, and<br/>say meekly, 'I'm afraid it tires you, ma'am. Shan't I stop<br/>now?'"<br/>
