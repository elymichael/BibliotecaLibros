<br/>Meg agreed at once, and promised her aid, gladly offering<br/>anything she possessed, from her little house itself to her very<br/>best saltspoons. But Jo frowned upon the whole project and would<br/>have nothing to do with it at first.<br/><br/>"Why in the world should you spend your money, worry your<br/>family, and turn the house upside down for a parcel of girls who<br/>don't care a sixpence for you? I thought you had too much pride and<br/>sense to truckle to any mortal woman just because she wears French<br/>boots and rides in a coupe," said Jo, who, being called from the<br/>tragic climax of her novel, was not in the best mood for social<br/>enterprises.<br/><br/>"I don't truckle, and I hate being patronized as much as you<br/>do!" returned Amy indignantly, for the two still jangled when such<br/>questions arose. "The girls do care for me, and I for them, and<br/>there's a great deal of kindness and sense and talent among them,<br/>in spite of what you call fashionable nonsense. You don't care to<br/>make people like you, to go into good society, and cultivate your<br/>manners and tastes. I do, and I mean to make the most of every<br/>chance that comes. You can go through the world with your elbows<br/>out and your nose in the air, and call it independence, if you<br/>like. That's not my way."<br/><br/>When Amy had whetted her tongue and freed her mind she usually<br/>got the best of it, for she seldom failed to have common sense on<br/>her side, while Jo carried her love of liberty and hate of<br/>conventionalities to such an unlimited extent that she naturally<br/>found herself worsted in an argument. Amy's definition of Jo's idea<br/>of independence was such a good hit that both burst out laughing,<br/>and the discussion took a more amiable turn. Much against her will,<br/>Jo at length consented to sacrifice a day to Mrs. Grundy, and help<br/>her sister through what she regarded as 'a nonsensical<br/>business'.<br/><br/>The invitations were sent, nearly all accepted, and the<br/>following Monday was set apart for the grand event. Hannah was out<br/>of humor because her week's work was deranged, and prophesied that<br/>"ef the washin' and ironin' warn't done reg'lar, nothin' would go<br/>well anywheres". This hitch in the mainspring of the domestic<br/>machinery had a bad effect upon the whole concern, but Amy's motto<br/>was 'Nil desperandum', and having made up her mind what to do, she<br/>proceeded to do it in spite of all obstacles. To begin with,<br/>Hannah's cooking didn't turn out well. The chicken was tough, the<br/>tongue too salty, and the chocolate wouldn't froth properly. Then<br/>the cake and ice cost more than Amy expected, so did the wagon, and<br/>various other expenses, which seemed trifling at the outset,<br/>counted up rather alarmingly afterward. Beth got a cold and took to<br/>her bed. Meg had an unusual number of callers to keep her at home,<br/>and Jo was in such a divided state of mind that her breakages,<br/>accidents, and mistakes were uncommonly numerous, serious, and<br/>trying.<br/><br/>If it was not fair on Monday, the young ladies were to come on<br/>Tuesday, an arrangement which aggravated Jo and Hannah to the last<br/>degree. On Monday morning the weather was in that undecided state<br/>which is more exasperating than a steady pour. It drizzled a<br/>little, shone a little, blew a little, and didn't make up its mind<br/>till it was too late for anyone else to make up theirs. Amy was up<br/>at dawn, hustling people out of their beds and through their<br/>breakfasts, that the house might be got in order. The parlor struck<br/>her as looking uncommonly shabby, but without stopping to sigh for<br/>what she had not, she skillfully made the best of what she had,<br/>arranging chairs over the worn places in the carpet, covering<br/>stains on the walls with homemade statuary, which gave an artistic<br/>air to the room, as did the lovely vases of flowers Jo scattered<br/>about.<br/><br/>The lunch looked charming, and as she surveyed it, she sincerely<br/>hoped it would taste well, and that the borrowed glass, china, and<br/>silver would get safely home again. The carriages were promised,<br/>Meg and Mother were all ready to do the honors, Beth was able to<br/>help Hannah behind the scenes, Jo had engaged to be as lively and<br/>amiable as an absent mind, and aching head, and a very decided<br/>disapproval of everybody and everything would allow, and as she<br/>wearily dressed, Amy cheered herself with anticipations of the<br/>happy moment when, lunch safely over, she should drive away with<br/>her friends for an afternoon of artistic delights, for the 'cherry<br/>bounce' and the broken bridge were her strong points.<br/><br/>Then came the hours of suspense, during which she vibrated from<br/>parlor to porch, while public opinion varied like the weathercock.<br/>A smart shower at eleven had evidently quenched the enthusiasm of<br/>the young ladies who were to arrive at twelve, for nobody came, and<br/>at two the exhausted family sat down in a blaze of sunshine to<br/>consume the perishable portions of the feast, that nothing might be<br/>lost.<br/><br/>"No doubt about the weather today, they will certainly come, so<br/>we must fly round and be ready for them," said Amy, as the sun woke<br/>her next morning. She spoke briskly, but in her secret soul she<br/>wished she had said nothing about Tuesday, for her interest like<br/>her cake was getting a little stale.<br/><br/>"I can't get any lobsters, so you will have to do without salad<br/>today," said Mr. March, coming in half an hour later, with an<br/>expression of placid despair.<br/><br/>
