<br/>If John had not forgotten all about the jelly, it really would<br/>have been unpardonable in him to choose that day, of all the days<br/>in the year, to bring a friend home to dinner unexpectedly.<br/>Congratulating himself that a handsome repast had been ordered that<br/>morning, feeling sure that it would be ready to the minute, and<br/>indulging in pleasant anticipations of the charming effect it would<br/>produce, when his pretty wife came running out to meet him, he<br/>escorted his friend to his mansion, with the irrepressible<br/>satisfaction of a young host and husband.<br/><br/>It is a world of disappointments, as John discovered when he<br/>reached the Dovecote. The front door usually stood hospitably open.<br/>Now it was not only shut, but locked, and yesterday's mud still<br/>adorned the steps. The parlor windows were closed and curtained, no<br/>picture of the pretty wife sewing on the piazza, in white, with a<br/>distracting little bow in her hair, or a bright-eyed hostess,<br/>smiling a shy welcome as she greeted her guest. Nothing of the<br/>sort, for not a soul appeared but a sanginary-looking boy asleep<br/>under the current bushes.<br/><br/>"I'm afraid something has happened. Step into the garden, Scott,<br/>while I look up Mrs. Brooke," said John, alarmed at the silence and<br/>solitude.<br/><br/>Round the house he hurried, led by a pungent smell of burned<br/>sugar, and Mr. Scott strolled after him, with a queer look on his<br/>face. He paused discreetly at a distance when Brooke disappeared,<br/>but he could both see and hear, and being a bachelor, enjoyed the<br/>prospect mightily.<br/><br/>In the kitchen reigned confusion and despair. One edition of<br/>jelly was trickled from pot to pot, another lay upon the floor, and<br/>a third was burning gaily on the stove. Lotty, with Teutonic<br/>phlegm, was calmly eating bread and currant wine, for the jelly was<br/>still in a hopelessly liquid state, while Mrs. Brooke, with her<br/>apron over her head, sat sobbing dismally.<br/><br/>"My dearest girl, what is the matter?" cried John, rushing in,<br/>with awful visions of scalded hands, sudden news of affliction, and<br/>secret consternation at the thought of the guest in the garden.<br/><br/>"Oh, John, I am so tired and hot and cross and worried! I've<br/>been at it till I'm all worn out. Do come and help me or I shall<br/>die!" and the exhausted housewife cast herself upon his breast,<br/>giving him a sweet welcome in every sense of the word, for her<br/>pinafore had been baptized at the same time as the floor.<br/><br/>"What worries you dear? Has anything dreadful happened?" asked<br/>the anxious John, tenderly kissing the crown of the little cap,<br/>which was all askew.<br/><br/>"Yes," sobbed Meg despairingly.<br/><br/>"Tell me quick, then. Don't cry. I can bear anything better than<br/>that. Out with it, love."<br/><br/>
