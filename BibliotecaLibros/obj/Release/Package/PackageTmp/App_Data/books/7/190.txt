"Good for you, Jo! Did you do it on your own responsibility?"
asked Laurie, as he seated her in the hall chair and took off the
rebellious boots, seeing how her hands shook.

"No. The doctor told us to."

"Oh, Jo, it's not so bad as that?" cried Laurie, with a startled
face.

"Yes, it is. She doesn't know us, she doesn't even talk about
the flocks of green doves, as she calls the vine leaves on the
wall. She doesn't look like my Beth, and there's nobody to help us
bear it. Mother and father both gone, and God seems so far away I
can't find Him."

As the tears streamed fast down poor Jo's cheeks, she stretched
out her hand in a helpless sort of way, as if groping in the dark,
and Laurie took it in his, whispering as well as he could with a
lump in his throat, "I'm here. Hold on to me, Jo, dear!"

She could not speak, but she did 'hold on', and the warm grasp
of the friendly human hand comforted her sore heart, and seemed to
lead her nearer to the Divine arm which alone could uphold her in
her trouble.

Laurie longed to say something tender and comfortable, but no
fitting words came to him, so he stood silent, gently stroking her
bent head as her mother used to do. It was the best thing he could
have done, far more soothing than the most eloquent words, for Jo
felt the unspoken sympathy, and in the silence learned the sweet
solace which affection administers to sorrow. Soon she dried the
tears which had relieved her, and looked up with a grateful
face.

"Thank you, Teddy, I'm better now. I don't feel so forlorn, and
will try to bear it if it comes."

"Keep hoping for the best, that will help you, Jo. Soon your
mother will be here, and then everything will be all right."

"I'm so glad Father is better. Now she won't feel so bad about
leaving him. Oh, me! It does seem as if all the troubles came in a
heap, and I got the heaviest part on my shoulders," sighed Jo,
spreading her wet handkerchief over her knees to dry.
