His very clothes seemed to partake of the hospitable nature of<br/>the wearer. They looked as if they were at ease, and liked to make<br/>him comfortable. His capacious waistcoat was suggestive of a large<br/>heart underneath. His rusty coat had a social air, and the baggy<br/>pockets plainly proved that little hands often went in empty and<br/>came out full. His very boots were benevolent, and his collars<br/>never stiff and raspy like other people's.<br/><br/>"That's it!" said Jo to herself, when she at length discovered<br/>that genuine good will toward one's fellow men could beautify and<br/>dignify even a stout German teacher, who shoveled in his dinner,<br/>darned his own socks, and was burdened with the name of Bhaer.<br/><br/>Jo valued goodness highly, but she also possessed a most<br/>feminine respect for intellect, and a little discovery which she<br/>made about the Professor added much to her regard for him. He never<br/>spoke of himself, and no one ever knew that in his native city he<br/>had been a man much honored and esteemed for learning and<br/>integrity, till a countryman came to see him. He never spoke of<br/>himself, and in a conversation with Miss Norton divulged the<br/>pleasing fact. From her Jo learned it, and liked it all the better<br/>because Mr. Bhaer had never told it. She felt proud to know that he<br/>was an honored Professor in Berlin, though only a poor<br/>language-master in America, and his homely, hard-working life was<br/>much beautified by the spice of romance which this discovery gave<br/>it. Another and a better gift than intellect was shown her in a<br/>most unexpected manner. Miss Norton had the entree into most<br/>society, which Jo would have had no chance of seeing but for her.<br/>The solitary woman felt an interest in the ambitious girl, and<br/>kindly conferred many favors of this sort both on Jo and the<br/>Professor. She took them with her one night to a select symposium,<br/>held in honor of several celebrities.<br/><br/>Jo went prepared to bow down and adore the mighty ones whom she<br/>had worshiped with youthful enthusiasm afar off. But her reverence<br/>for genius received a severe shock that night, and it took her some<br/>time to recover from the discovery that the great creatures were<br/>only men and women after all. Imagine her dismay, on stealing a<br/>glance of timid admiration at the poet whose lines suggested an<br/>ethereal being fed on 'spirit, fire, and dew', to behold him<br/>devouring his supper with an ardor which flushed his intellectual<br/>countenance. Turning as from a fallen idol, she made other<br/>discoveries which rapidly dispelled her romantic illusions. The<br/>great novelist vibrated between two decanters with the regularity<br/>of a pendulum; the famous divine flirted openly with one of the<br/>Madame de Staels of the age, who looked daggers at another Corinne,<br/>who was amiably satirizing her, after outmaneuvering her in efforts<br/>to absorb the profound philosopher, who imbibed tea Johnsonianly<br/>and appeared to slumber, the loquacity of the lady rendering speech<br/>impossible. The scientific celebrities, forgetting their mollusks<br/>and glacial periods, gossiped about art, while devoting themselves<br/>to oysters and ices with characteristic energy; the young musician,<br/>who was charming the city like a second Orpheus, talked horses; and<br/>the specimen of the British nobility present happened to be the<br/>most ordinary man of the party.<br/><br/>Before the evening was half over, Jo felt so completely<br/>disillusioned, that she sat down in a corner to recover herself.<br/>Mr. Bhaer soon joined her, looking rather out of his element, and<br/>presently several of the philosophers, each mounted on his hobby,<br/>came ambling up to hold an intellectual tournament in the recess.<br/>The conversations were miles beyond Jo's comprehension, but she<br/>enjoyed it, though Kant and Hegel were unknown gods, the Subjective<br/>and Objective unintelligible terms, and the only thing 'evolved<br/>from her inner consciousness' was a bad headache after it was all<br/>over. It dawned upon her gradually that the world was being picked<br/>to pieces, and put together on new and, according to the talkers,<br/>on infinitely better principles than before, that religion was in a<br/>fair way to be reasoned into nothingness, and intellect was to be<br/>the only God. Jo knew nothing about philosophy or metaphysics of<br/>any sort, but a curious excitement, half pleasurable, half painful,<br/>came over her as she listened with a sense of being turned adrift<br/>into time and space, like a young balloon out on a holiday.<br/><br/>She looked round to see how the Professor liked it, and found<br/>him looking at her with the grimmest expression she had ever seen<br/>him wear. He shook his head and beckoned her to come away, but she<br/>was fascinated just then by the freedom of Speculative Philosophy,<br/>and kept her seat, trying to find out what the wise gentlemen<br/>intended to rely upon after they had annihilated all the old<br/>beliefs.<br/><br/>Now, Mr. Bhaer was a diffident man and slow to offer his own<br/>opinions, not because they were unsettled, but too sincere and<br/>earnest to be lightly spoken. As he glanced from Jo to several<br/>other young people, attracted by the brilliancy of the philosophic<br/>pyrotechnics, he knit his brows and longed to speak, fearing that<br/>some inflammable young soul would be led astray by the rockets, to<br/>find when the display was over that they had only an empty stick or<br/>a scorched hand.<br/><br/>He bore it as long as he could, but when he was appealed to for<br/>an opinion, he blazed up with honest indignation and defended<br/>religion with all the eloquence of truthâ€”an eloquence which made<br/>his broken English musical and his plain face beautiful. He had a<br/>hard fight, for the wise men argued well, but he didn't know when<br/>he was beaten and stood to his colors like a man. Somehow, as he<br/>talked, the world got right again to Jo. The old beliefs, that had<br/>lasted so long, seemed better than the new. God was not a blind<br/>force, and immortality was not a pretty fable, but a blessed fact.<br/>She felt as if she had solid ground under her feet again, and when<br/>Mr. Bhaer paused, outtalked but not one whit convinced, Jo wanted<br/>to clap her hands and thank him.<br/><br/>She did neither, but she remembered the scene, and gave the<br/>Professor her heartiest respect, for she knew it cost him an effort<br/>to speak out then and there, because his conscience would not let<br/>him be silent. She began to see that character is a better<br/>possession than money, rank, intellect, or beauty, and to feel that<br/>if greatness is what a wise man has defined it to be, 'truth,<br/>reverence, and good will', then her friend Friedrich Bhaer was not<br/>only good, but great.<br/><br/>This belief strengthened daily. She valued his esteem, she<br/>coveted his respect, she wanted to be worthy of his friendship, and<br/>just when the wish was sincerest, she came near to losing<br/>everything. It all grew out of a cocked hat, for one evening the<br/>Professor came in to give Jo her lesson with a paper soldier cap on<br/>his head, which Tina had put there and he had forgotten to take<br/>off.<br/><br/>"It's evident he doesn't look in his glass before coming down,"<br/>thought Jo, with a smile, as he said "Goot efening," and sat<br/>soberly down, quite unconscious of the ludicrous contrast between<br/>his subject and his headgear, for he was going to read her the<br/>Death of Wallenstein.<br/>
