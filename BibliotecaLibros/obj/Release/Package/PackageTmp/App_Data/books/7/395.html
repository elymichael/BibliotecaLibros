Where's<br/>Amy?"<br/><br/>"Your mother has got her down at Meg's. We stopped there by the<br/>way, and there was no getting my wife out of their clutches."<br/><br/>"Your what?" cried Jo, for Laurie uttered those two words with<br/>an unconscious pride and satisfaction which betrayed him.<br/><br/>"Oh, the dickens! Now I've done it," and he looked so guilty<br/>that Jo was down on him like a flash.<br/><br/>"You've gone and got married!"<br/><br/>"Yes, please, but I never will again," and he went down upon his<br/>knees, with a penitent clasping of hands, and a face full of<br/>mischief, mirth, and triumph.<br/><br/>"Actually married?"<br/><br/>"Very much so, thank you."<br/><br/>
