<br/>"Upon my word, I didn't move it. It rolled a bit, perhaps, but<br/>that is allowed. So, stand off please, and let me have a go at the<br/>stake."<br/><br/>"We don't cheat in America, but you can, if you choose," said Jo<br/>angrily.<br/><br/>"Yankees are a deal the most tricky, everybody knows. There you<br/>go!" returned Fred, croqueting her ball far away.<br/><br/>Jo opened her lips to say something rude, but checked herself in<br/>time, colored up to her forehead and stood a minute, hammering down<br/>a wicket with all her might, while Fred hit the stake and declared<br/>himself out with much exultation. She went off to get her ball, and<br/>was a long time finding it among the bushes, but she came back,<br/>looking cool and quiet, and waited her turn patiently. It took<br/>several strokes to regain the place she had lost, and when she got<br/>there, the other side had nearly won, for Kate's ball was the last<br/>but one and lay near the stake.<br/><br/>"By George, it's all up with us! Goodbye, Kate. Miss Jo owes me<br/>one, so you are finished," cried Fred excitedly, as they all drew<br/>near to see the finish.<br/><br/>"Yankees have a trick of being generous to their enemies," said<br/>Jo, with a look that made the lad redden, "especially when they<br/>beat them," she added, as, leaving Kate's ball untouched, she won<br/>the game by a clever stroke.<br/><br/>Laurie threw up his hat, then remembered that it wouldn't do to<br/>exult over the defeat of his guests, and stopped in the middle of<br/>the cheer to whisper to his friend, "Good for you, Jo! He did<br/>cheat, I saw him. We can't tell him so, but he won't do it again,<br/>take my word for it."<br/><br/>Meg drew her aside, under pretense of pinning up a loose braid,<br/>and said approvingly, "It was dreadfully provoking, but you kept<br/>your temper, and I'm so glad, Jo."<br/><br/>"Don't praise me, Meg, for I could box his ears this minute. I<br/>should certainly have boiled over if I hadn't stayed among the<br/>nettles till I got my rage under control enough to hold my tongue.<br/>It's simmering now, so I hope he'll keep out of my way," returned<br/>Jo, biting her lips as she glowered at Fred from under her big<br/>hat.<br/><br/>"Time for lunch," said Mr. Brooke, looking at his watch.<br/>"Commissary general, will you make the fire and get water, while<br/>Miss March, Miss Sallie, and I spread the table? Who can make good<br/>coffee?"<br/><br/>
