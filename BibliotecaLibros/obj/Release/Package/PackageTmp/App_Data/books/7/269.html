<br/>John was a mild man, but he was human, and after a long day's<br/>work to come home tired, hungry, and hopeful, to find a chaotic<br/>house, an empty table, and a cross wife was not exactly conducive<br/>to repose of mind or manner. He restrained himself however, and the<br/>little squall would have blown over, but for one unlucky word.<br/><br/>"It's a scrape, I acknowledge, but if you will lend a hand,<br/>we'll pull through and have a good time yet. Don't cry, dear, but<br/>just exert yourself a bit, and fix us up something to eat. We're<br/>both as hungry as hunters, so we shan't mind what it is. Give us<br/>the cold meat, and bread and cheese. We won't ask for jelly."<br/><br/>He meant it to be a good-natured joke, but that one word sealed<br/>his fate. Meg thought it was too cruel to hint about her sad<br/>failure, and the last atom of patience vanished as he spoke.<br/><br/>"You must get yourself out of the scrape as you can. I'm too<br/>used up to 'exert' myself for anyone. It's like a man to propose a<br/>bone and vulgar bread and cheese for company. I won't have anything<br/>of the sort in my house. Take that Scott up to Mother's, and tell<br/>him I'm away, sick, dead, anything. I won't see him, and you two<br/>can laugh at me and my jelly as much as you like. You won't have<br/>anything else here." and having delivered her defiance all on one<br/>breath, Meg cast away her pinafore and precipitately left the field<br/>to bemoan herself in her own room.<br/><br/>What those two creatures did in her absence, she never knew, but<br/>Mr. Scott was not taken 'up to Mother's', and when Meg descended,<br/>after they had strolled away together, she found traces of a<br/>promiscuous lunch which filled her with horror. Lotty reported that<br/>they had eaten "a much, and greatly laughed, and the master bid her<br/>throw away all the sweet stuff, and hide the pots."<br/><br/>Meg longed to go and tell Mother, but a sense of shame at her<br/>own short-comings, of loyalty to John, "who might be cruel, but<br/>nobody should know it," restrained her, and after a summary<br/>cleaning up, she dressed herself prettily, and sat down to wait for<br/>John to come and be forgiven.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, John didn't come, not seeing the matter in that<br/>light. He had carried it off as a good joke with Scott, excused his<br/>little wife as well as he could, and played the host so hospitably<br/>that his friend enjoyed the impromptu dinner, and promised to come<br/>again, but John was angry, though he did not show it, he felt that<br/>Meg had deserted him in his hour of need. "It wasn't fair to tell a<br/>man to bring folks home any time, with perfect freedom, and when he<br/>took you at your word, to flame up and blame him, and leave him in<br/>the lurch, to be laughed at or pitied. No, by George, it wasn't!<br/>And Meg must know it."<br/><br/>He had fumed inwardly during the feast, but when the flurry was<br/>over and he strolled home after seeing Scott off, a milder mood<br/>came over him. "Poor little thing! It was hard upon her when she<br/>tried so heartily to please me. She was wrong, of course, but then<br/>she was young. I must be patient and teach her." He hoped she had<br/>not gone homeâ€”he hated gossip and interference. For a minute he was<br/>ruffled again at the mere thought of it, and then the fear that Meg<br/>would cry herself sick softened his heart, and sent him on at a<br/>quicker pace, resolving to be calm and kind, but firm, quite firm,<br/>and show her where she had failed in her duty to her spouse.<br/><br/>Meg likewise resolved to be 'calm and kind, but firm', and show<br/>him his duty. She longed to run to meet him, and beg pardon, and be<br/>kissed and comforted, as she was sure of being, but, of course, she<br/>did nothing of the sort, and when she saw John coming, began to hum<br/>quite naturally, as she rocked and sewed, like a lady of leisure in<br/>her best parlor.<br/><br/>John was a little disappointed not to find a tender Niobe, but<br/>feeling that his dignity demanded the first apology, he made none,<br/>only came leisurely in and laid himself upon the sofa with the<br/>singularly relevant remark, "We are going to have a new moon, my<br/>dear."<br/><br/>
