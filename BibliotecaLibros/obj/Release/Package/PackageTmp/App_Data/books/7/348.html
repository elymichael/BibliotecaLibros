<br/>Laurie did not read all this while he watched her feed the<br/>peacocks, but he saw enough to satisfy and interest him, and<br/>carried away a pretty little picture of a bright-faced girl<br/>standing in the sunshine, which brought out the soft hue of her<br/>dress, the fresh color of her cheeks, the golden gloss of her hair,<br/>and made her a prominent figure in the pleasant scene.<br/><br/>As they came up onto the stone plateau that crowns the hill, Amy<br/>waved her hand as if welcoming him to her favorite haunt, and said,<br/>pointing here and there, "Do you remember the Cathedral and the<br/>Corso, the fishermen dragging their nets in the bay, and the lovely<br/>road to Villa Franca, Schubert's Tower, just below, and best of<br/>all, that speck far out to sea which they say is Corsica?"<br/><br/>"I remember. It's not much changed," he answered without<br/>enthusiasm.<br/><br/>"What Jo would give for a sight of that famous speck!" said Amy,<br/>feeling in good spirits and anxious to see him so also.<br/><br/>"Yes," was all he said, but he turned and strained his eyes to<br/>see the island which a greater usurper than even Napoleon now made<br/>interesting in his sight.<br/><br/>"Take a good look at it for her sake, and then come and tell me<br/>what you have been doing with yourself all this while," said Amy,<br/>seating herself, ready for a good talk.<br/><br/>But she did not get it, for though he joined her and answered<br/>all her questions freely, she could only learn that he had roved<br/>about the Continent and been to Greece. So after idling away an<br/>hour, they drove home again, and having paid his respects to Mrs.<br/>Carrol, Laurie left them, promising to return in the evening.<br/><br/>It must be recorded of Amy that she deliberately prinked that<br/>night. Time and absence had done its work on both the young people.<br/>She had seen her old friend in a new light, not as 'our boy', but<br/>as a handsome and agreeable man, and she was conscious of a very<br/>natural desire to find favor in his sight. Amy knew her good<br/>points, and made the most of them with the taste and skill which is<br/>a fortune to a poor and pretty woman.<br/><br/>Tarlatan and tulle were cheap at Nice, so she enveloped herself<br/>in them on such occasions, and following the sensible English<br/>fashion of simple dress for young girls, got up charming little<br/>toilettes with fresh flowers, a few trinkets, and all manner of<br/>dainty devices, which were both inexpensive and effective. It must<br/>be confessed that the artist sometimes got possession of the woman,<br/>and indulged in antique coiffures, statuesque attitudes, and<br/>classic draperies. But, dear heart, we all have our little<br/>weaknesses, and find it easy to pardon such in the young, who<br/>satisfy our eyes with their comeliness, and keep our hearts merry<br/>with their artless vanities.<br/><br/>"I do want him to think I look well, and tell them so at home,"<br/>said Amy to herself, as she put on Flo's old white silk ball dress,<br/>and covered it with a cloud of fresh illusion, out of which her<br/>white shoulders and golden head emerged with a most artistic<br/>effect. Her hair she had the sense to let alone, after gathering up<br/>the thick waves and curls into a Hebe-like knot at the back of her<br/>head.<br/><br/>
