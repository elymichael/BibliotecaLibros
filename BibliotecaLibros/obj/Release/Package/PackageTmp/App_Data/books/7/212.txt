"I'll try, but it was a very ungentlemanly thing to do, I didn't
think you could be so sly and malicious, Laurie," replied Meg,
trying to hide her maidenly confusion under a gravely reproachful
air.

"It was altogether abominable, and I don't deserve to be spoken
to for a month, but you will, though, won't you?" And Laurie folded
his hands together with such and imploring gesture, as he spoke in
his irresistibly persuasive tone, that it was impossible to frown
upon him in spite of his scandalous behavior.

Meg pardoned him, and Mrs. March's grave face relaxed, in spite
of her efforts to keep sober, when she heard him declare that he
would atone for his sins by all sorts of penances, and abase
himself like a worm before the injured damsel.

Jo stood aloof, meanwhile, trying to harden her heart against
him, and succeeding only in primming up her face into an expression
of entire disapprobation. Laurie looked at her once or twice, but
as she showed no sign of relenting, he felt injured, and turned his
back on her till the others were done with him, when he made her a
low bow and walked off without a word.

As soon as he had gone, she wished she had been more forgiving,
and when Meg and her mother went upstairs, she felt lonely and
longed for Teddy. After resisting for some time, she yielded to the
impulse, and armed with a book to return, went over to the big
house.

"Is Mr. Laurence in?" asked Jo, of a housemaid, who was coming
downstairs.

"Yes, Miss, but I don't believe he's seeable just yet."

"Why not? Is he ill?"

"La, no Miss, but he's had a scene with Mr. Laurie, who is in
one of his tantrums about something, which vexes the old gentleman,
so I dursn't go nigh him."

"Where is Laurie?"

"Shut up in his room, and he won't answer, though I've been
a-tapping. I don't know what's to become of the dinner, for it's
ready, and there's no one to eat it."
