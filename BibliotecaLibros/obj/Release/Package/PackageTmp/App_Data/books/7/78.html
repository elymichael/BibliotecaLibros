<br/>The patience and the humility of the face she loved so well was<br/>a better lesson to Jo than the wisest lecture, the sharpest<br/>reproof. She felt comforted at once by the sympathy and confidence<br/>given her. The knowledge that her mother had a fault like hers, and<br/>tried to mend it, made her own easier to bear and strengthened her<br/>resolution to cure it, though forty years seemed rather a long time<br/>to watch and pray to a girl of fifteen.<br/><br/>"Mother, are you angry when you fold your lips tight together<br/>and go out of the room sometimes, when Aunt March scolds or people<br/>worry you?" asked Jo, feeling nearer and dearer to her mother than<br/>ever before.<br/><br/>"Yes, I've learned to check the hasty words that rise to my<br/>lips, and when I feel that they mean to break out against my will,<br/>I just go away for a minute, and give myself a little shake for<br/>being so weak and wicked," answered Mrs. March with a sigh and a<br/>smile, as she smoothed and fastened up Jo's disheveled hair.<br/><br/>"How did you learn to keep still? That is what troubles me, for<br/>the sharp words fly out before I know what I'm about, and the more<br/>I say the worse I get, till it's a pleasure to hurt people's<br/>feelings and say dreadful things. Tell me how you do it, Marmee<br/>dear."<br/><br/>"My good mother used to help me… "<br/><br/>"As you do us… " interrupted Jo, with a grateful kiss.<br/><br/>"But I lost her when I was a little older than you are, and for<br/>years had to struggle on alone, for I was too proud to confess my<br/>weakness to anyone else. I had a hard time, Jo, and shed a good<br/>many bitter tears over my failures, for in spite of my efforts I<br/>never seemed to get on. Then your father came, and I was so happy<br/>that I found it easy to be good. But by-and-by, when I had four<br/>little daughters round me and we were poor, then the old trouble<br/>began again, for I am not patient by nature, and it tried me very<br/>much to see my children wanting anything."<br/><br/>"Poor Mother! What helped you then?"<br/><br/>"Your father, Jo. He never loses patience, never doubts or<br/>complains, but always hopes, and works and waits so cheerfully that<br/>one is ashamed to do otherwise before him. He helped and comforted<br/>me, and showed me that I must try to practice all the virtues I<br/>would have my little girls possess, for I was their example. It was<br/>easier to try for your sakes than for my own. A startled or<br/>surprised look from one of you when I spoke sharply rebuked me more<br/>than any words could have done, and the love, respect, and<br/>confidence of my children was the sweetest reward I could receive<br/>for my efforts to be the woman I would have them copy."<br/><br/>"Oh, Mother, if I'm ever half as good as you, I shall be<br/>satisfied," cried Jo, much touched.<br/><br/>
