"No, I can't. I've tried and failed, and I won't risk our<br/>happiness by such a serious experiment. We don't agree and we never<br/>shall, so we'll be good friends all our lives, but we won't go and<br/>do anything rash."<br/><br/>"Yes, we will if we get the chance," muttered Laurie<br/>rebelliously.<br/><br/>"Now do be reasonable, and take a sensible view of the case,"<br/>implored Jo, almost at her wit's end.<br/><br/>"I won't be reasonable. I don't want to take what you call 'a<br/>sensible view'. It won't help me, and it only makes it harder. I<br/>don't believe you've got any heart."<br/><br/>"I wish I hadn't."<br/><br/>There was a little quiver in Jo's voice, and thinking it a good<br/>omen, Laurie turned round, bringing all his persuasive powers to<br/>bear as he said, in the wheedlesome tone that had never been so<br/>dangerously wheedlesome before, "Don't disappoint us, dear!<br/>Everyone expects it. Grandpa has set his heart upon it, your people<br/>like it, and I can't get on without you. Say you will, and let's be<br/>happy. Do, do!"<br/><br/>Not until months afterward did Jo understand how she had the<br/>strength of mind to hold fast to the resolution she had made when<br/>she decided that she did not love her boy, and never could. It was<br/>very hard to do, but she did it, knowing that delay was both<br/>useless and cruel.<br/><br/>"I can't say 'yes' truly, so I won't say it at all. You'll see<br/>that I'm right, by-and-by, and thank me for it… " she began<br/>solemnly.<br/><br/>"I'll be hanged if I do!" and Laurie bounced up off the grass,<br/>burning with indignation at the very idea.<br/><br/>"Yes, you will!" persisted Jo. "You'll get over this after a<br/>while, and find some lovely accomplished girl, who will adore you,<br/>and make a fine mistress for your fine house. I shouldn't. I'm<br/>homely and awkward and odd and old, and you'd be ashamed of me, and<br/>we should quarrel—we can't help it even now, you see—and I<br/>shouldn't like elegant society and you would, and you'd hate my<br/>scribbling, and I couldn't get on without it, and we should be<br/>unhappy, and wish we hadn't done it, and everything would be<br/>horrid!"<br/><br/>"Anything more?" asked Laurie, finding it hard to listen<br/>patiently to this prophetic burst.<br/>
