<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>20<br/>Surprises<br/><br/><br/>Jo was alone in the twilight, lying on the old sofa, looking at<br/>the fire, and thinking. It was her favorite way of spending the<br/>hour of dusk. No one disturbed her, and she used to lie there on<br/>Beth's little red pillow, planning stories, dreaming dreams, or<br/>thinking tender thoughts of the sister who never seemed far away.<br/>Her face looked tired, grave, and rather sad, for tomorrow was her<br/>birthday, and she was thinking how fast the years went by, how old<br/>she was getting, and how little she seemed to have accomplished.<br/>Almost twenty-five, and nothing to show for it. Jo was mistaken in<br/>that. There was a good deal to show, and by-and-by she saw, and was<br/>grateful for it.<br/><br/>"An old maid, that's what I'm to be. A literary spinster, with a<br/>pen for a spouse, a family of stories for children, and twenty<br/>years hence a morsel of fame, perhaps, when, like poor Johnson, I'm<br/>old and can't enjoy it, solitary, and can't share it, independent,<br/>and don't need it. Well, I needn't be a sour saint nor a selfish<br/>sinner, and, I dare say, old maids are very comfortable when they<br/>get used to it, but… " and there Jo sighed, as if the prospect was<br/>not inviting.<br/><br/>It seldom is, at first, and thirty seems the end of all things<br/>to five-and-twenty. But it's not as bad as it looks, and one can<br/>get on quite happily if one has something in one's self to fall<br/>back upon. At twenty-five, girls begin to talk about being old<br/>maids, but secretly resolve that they never will be. At thirty they<br/>say nothing about it, but quietly accept the fact, and if sensible,<br/>console themselves by remembering that they have twenty more<br/>useful, happy years, in which they may be learning to grow old<br/>gracefully. Don't laugh at the spinsters, dear girls, for often<br/>very tender, tragic romances are hidden away in the hearts that<br/>beat so quietly under the sober gowns, and many silent sacrifices<br/>of youth, health, ambition, love itself, make the faded faces<br/>beautiful in God's sight. Even the sad, sour sisters should be<br/>kindly dealt with, because they have missed the sweetest part of<br/>life, if for no other reason. And looking at them with compassion,<br/>not contempt, girls in their bloom should remember that they too<br/>may miss the blossom time. That rosy cheeks don't last forever,<br/>that silver threads will come in the bonnie brown hair, and that,<br/>by-and-by, kindness and respect will be as sweet as love and<br/>admiration now.<br/><br/>Gentlemen, which means boys, be courteous to the old maids, no<br/>matter how poor and plain and prim, for the only chivalry worth<br/>having is that which is the readiest to pay deference to the old,<br/>protect the feeble, and serve womankind, regardless of rank, age,<br/>or color. Just recollect the good aunts who have not only lectured<br/>and fussed, but nursed and petted, too often without thanks, the<br/>scrapes they have helped you out of, the tips they have given you<br/>from their small store, the stitches the patient old fingers have<br/>set for you, the steps the willing old feet have taken, and<br/>gratefully pay the dear old ladies the little attentions that women<br/>love to receive as long as they live. The bright-eyed girls are<br/>quick to see such traits, and will like you all the better for<br/>them, and if death, almost the only power that can part mother and<br/>son, should rob you of yours, you will be sure to find a tender<br/>welcome and maternal cherishing from some Aunt Priscilla, who has<br/>kept the warmest corner of her lonely old heart for 'the best nevvy<br/>in the world'.<br/><br/>Jo must have fallen asleep (as I dare say my reader has during<br/>this little homily), for suddenly Laurie's ghost seemed to stand<br/>before her, a substantial, lifelike ghost, leaning over her with<br/>the very look he used to wear when he felt a good deal and didn't<br/>like to show it. But, like Jenny in the ballad…<br/><br/>"She could not think it he,"<br/><br/>and lay staring up at him in startled silence, till he stooped<br/>and kissed her. Then she knew him, and flew up, crying<br/>joyfully…<br/>
