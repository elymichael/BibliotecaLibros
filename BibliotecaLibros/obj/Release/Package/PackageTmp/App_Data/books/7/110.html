"You rogue! You traitor! Jo, how could you?" cried the three<br/>girls, as Snodgrass led her friend triumphantly forth, and<br/>producing both a chair and a badge, installed him in a jiffy.<br/><br/>"The coolness of you two rascals is amazing," began Mr.<br/>Pickwick, trying to get up an awful frown and only succeeding in<br/>producing an amiable smile. But the new member was equal to the<br/>occasion, and rising, with a grateful salutation to the Chair, said<br/>in the most engaging manner, "Mr. President and ladies—I beg<br/>pardon, gentlemen—allow me to introduce myself as Sam Weller, the<br/>very humble servant of the club."<br/><br/>"Good! Good!" cried Jo, pounding with the handle of the old<br/>warming pan on which she leaned.<br/><br/>"My faithful friend and noble patron," continued Laurie with a<br/>wave of the hand, "who has so flatteringly presented me, is not to<br/>be blamed for the base stratagem of tonight. I planned it, and she<br/>only gave in after lots of teasing."<br/><br/>"Come now, don't lay it all on yourself. You know I proposed the<br/>cupboard," broke in Snodgrass, who was enjoying the joke<br/>amazingly.<br/><br/>"Never mind what she says. I'm the wretch that did it, sir,"<br/>said the new member, with a Welleresque nod to Mr. Pickwick. "But<br/>on my honor, I never will do so again, and henceforth devote myself<br/>to the interest of this immortal club."<br/><br/>"Hear! Hear!" cried Jo, clashing the lid of the warming pan like<br/>a cymbal.<br/><br/>"Go on, go on!" added Winkle and Tupman, while the President<br/>bowed benignly.<br/><br/>"I merely wish to say, that as a slight token of my gratitude<br/>for the honor done me, and as a means of promoting friendly<br/>relations between adjoining nations, I have set up a post office in<br/>the hedge in the lower corner of the garden, a fine, spacious<br/>building with padlocks on the doors and every convenience for the<br/>mails, also the females, if I may be allowed the expression. It's<br/>the old martin house, but I've stopped up the door and made the<br/>roof open, so it will hold all sorts of things, and save our<br/>valuable time. Letters, manuscripts, books, and bundles can be<br/>passed in there, and as each nation has a key, it will be<br/>uncommonly nice, I fancy. Allow me to present the club key, and<br/>with many thanks for your favor, take my seat."<br/><br/>Great applause as Mr. Weller deposited a little key on the table<br/>and subsided, the warming pan clashed and waved wildly, and it was<br/>some time before order could be restored. A long discussion<br/>followed, and everyone came out surprising, for everyone did her<br/>best. So it was an unusually lively meeting, and did not adjourn<br/>till a late hour, when it broke up with three shrill cheers for the<br/>new member.<br/><br/>No one ever regretted the admittance of Sam Weller, for a more<br/>devoted, well-behaved, and jovial member no club could have. He<br/>certainly did add 'spirit' to the meetings, and 'a tone' to the<br/>paper, for his orations convulsed his hearers and his contributions<br/>were excellent, being patriotic, classical, comical, or dramatic,<br/>but never sentimental. Jo regarded them as worthy of Bacon, Milton,<br/>or Shakespeare, and remodeled her own works with good effect, she<br/>thought.<br/>
