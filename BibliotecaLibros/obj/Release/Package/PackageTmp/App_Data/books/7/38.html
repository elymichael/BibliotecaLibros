<br/>Beth had a headache and lay on the sofa, trying to comfort<br/>herself with the cat and three kittens. Amy was fretting because<br/>her lessons were not learned, and she couldn't find her rubbers. Jo<br/>would whistle and make a great racket getting ready.<br/><br/>Mrs. March was very busy trying to finish a letter, which must<br/>go at once, and Hannah had the grumps, for being up late didn't<br/>suit her.<br/><br/>"There never was such a cross family!" cried Jo, losing her<br/>temper when she had upset an inkstand, broken both boot lacings,<br/>and sat down upon her hat.<br/><br/>"You're the crossest person in it!" returned Amy, washing out<br/>the sum that was all wrong with the tears that had fallen on her<br/>slate.<br/><br/>"Beth, if you don't keep these horrid cats down cellar I'll have<br/>them drowned," exclaimed Meg angrily as she tried to get rid of the<br/>kitten which had scrambled up her back and stuck like a burr just<br/>out of reach.<br/><br/>Jo laughed, Meg scolded, Beth implored, and Amy wailed because<br/>she couldn't remember how much nine times twelve was.<br/><br/>"Girls, girls, do be quiet one minute! I must get this off by<br/>the early mail, and you drive me distracted with your worry," cried<br/>Mrs. March, crossing out the third spoiled sentence in her<br/>letter.<br/><br/>There was a momentary lull, broken by Hannah, who stalked in,<br/>laid two hot turnovers on the table, and stalked out again. These<br/>turnovers were an institution, and the girls called them 'muffs',<br/>for they had no others and found the hot pies very comforting to<br/>their hands on cold mornings.<br/><br/>Hannah never forgot to make them, no matter how busy or grumpy<br/>she might be, for the walk was long and bleak. The poor things got<br/>no other lunch and were seldom home before two.<br/><br/>"Cuddle your cats and get over your headache, Bethy. Goodbye,<br/>Marmee. We are a set of rascals this morning, but we'll come home<br/>regular angels. Now then, Meg!" And Jo tramped away, feeling that<br/>the pilgrims were not setting out as they ought to do.<br/><br/>
