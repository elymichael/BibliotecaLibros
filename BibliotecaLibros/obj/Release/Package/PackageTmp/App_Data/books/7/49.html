"No, I came to amuse you. Shall I read aloud?" and Jo looked<br/>affectionately toward some inviting books near by.<br/><br/>"Thank you! I've read all those, and if you don't mind, I'd<br/>rather talk," answered Laurie.<br/><br/>"Not a bit. I'll talk all day if you'll only set me going. Beth<br/>says I never know when to stop."<br/><br/>"Is Beth the rosy one, who stays at home good deal and sometimes<br/>goes out with a little basket?" asked Laurie with interest.<br/><br/>"Yes, that's Beth. She's my girl, and a regular good one she is,<br/>too."<br/><br/>"The pretty one is Meg, and the curly-haired one is Amy, I<br/>believe?"<br/><br/>"How did you find that out?"<br/><br/>Laurie colored up, but answered frankly, "Why, you see I often<br/>hear you calling to one another, and when I'm alone up here, I<br/>can't help looking over at your house, you always seem to be having<br/>such good times. I beg your pardon for being so rude, but sometimes<br/>you forget to put down the curtain at the window where the flowers<br/>are. And when the lamps are lighted, it's like looking at a picture<br/>to see the fire, and you all around the table with your mother. Her<br/>face is right opposite, and it looks so sweet behind the flowers, I<br/>can't help watching it. I haven't got any mother, you know." And<br/>Laurie poked the fire to hide a little twitching of the lips that<br/>he could not control.<br/><br/>The solitary, hungry look in his eyes went straight to Jo's warm<br/>heart. She had been so simply taught that there was no nonsense in<br/>her head, and at fifteen she was as innocent and frank as any<br/>child. Laurie was sick and lonely, and feeling how rich she was in<br/>home and happiness, she gladly tried to share it with him. Her face<br/>was very friendly and her sharp voice unusually gentle as she<br/>saidâ€¦<br/><br/>"We'll never draw that curtain any more, and I give you leave to<br/>look as much as you like. I just wish, though, instead of peeping,<br/>you'd come over and see us. Mother is so splendid, she'd do you<br/>heaps of good, and Beth would sing to you if I begged her to, and<br/>Amy would dance. Meg and I would make you laugh over our funny<br/>stage properties, and we'd have jolly times. Wouldn't your grandpa<br/>let you?"<br/><br/>"I think he would, if your mother asked him. He's very kind,<br/>though he does not look so, and he lets me do what I like, pretty<br/>much, only he's afraid I might be a bother to strangers," began<br/>Laurie, brightening more and more.<br/>
