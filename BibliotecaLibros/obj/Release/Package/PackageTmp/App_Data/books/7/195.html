<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>19<br/>Amyâ€™s Will<br/><br/><br/>While these things were happening at home, Amy was having hard<br/>times at Aunt March's. She felt her exile deeply, and for the first<br/>time in her life, realized how much she was beloved and petted at<br/>home. Aunt March never petted any one; she did not approve of it,<br/>but she meant to be kind, for the well-behaved little girl pleased<br/>her very much, and Aunt March had a soft place in her old heart for<br/>her nephew's children, though she didn't think it proper to confess<br/>it. She really did her best to make Amy happy, but, dear me, what<br/>mistakes she made. Some old people keep young at heart in spite of<br/>wrinkles and gray hairs, can sympathize with children's little<br/>cares and joys, make them feel at home, and can hide wise lessons<br/>under pleasant plays, giving and receiving friendship in the<br/>sweetest way. But Aunt March had not this gift, and she worried Amy<br/>very much with her rules and orders, her prim ways, and long, prosy<br/>talks. Finding the child more docile and amiable than her sister,<br/>the old lady felt it her duty to try and counteract, as far as<br/>possible, the bad effects of home freedom and indulgence. So she<br/>took Amy by the hand, and taught her as she herself had been taught<br/>sixty years ago, a process which carried dismay to Amy's soul, and<br/>made her feel like a fly in the web of a very strict spider.<br/><br/>She had to wash the cups every morning, and polish up the<br/>old-fashioned spoons, the fat silver teapot, and the glasses till<br/>they shone. Then she must dust the room, and what a trying job that<br/>was. Not a speck escaped Aunt March's eye, and all the furniture<br/>had claw legs and much carving, which was never dusted to suit.<br/>Then Polly had to be fed, the lap dog combed, and a dozen trips<br/>upstairs and down to get things or deliver orders, for the old lady<br/>was very lame and seldom left her big chair. After these tiresome<br/>labors, she must do her lessons, which was a daily trial of every<br/>virtue she possessed. Then she was allowed one hour for exercise or<br/>play, and didn't she enjoy it?<br/><br/>Laurie came every day, and wheedled Aunt March till Amy was<br/>allowed to go out with him, when they walked and rode and had<br/>capital times. After dinner, she had to read aloud, and sit still<br/>while the old lady slept, which she usually did for an hour, as she<br/>dropped off over the first page. Then patchwork or towels appeared,<br/>and Amy sewed with outward meekness and inward rebellion till dusk,<br/>when she was allowed to amuse herself as she liked till teatime.<br/>The evenings were the worst of all, for Aunt March fell to telling<br/>long stories about her youth, which were so unutterably dull that<br/>Amy was always ready to go to bed, intending to cry over her hard<br/>fate, but usually going to sleep before she had squeezed out more<br/>than a tear or two.<br/><br/>If it had not been for Laurie, and old Esther, the maid, she<br/>felt that she never could have got through that dreadful time. The<br/>parrot alone was enough to drive her distracted, for he soon felt<br/>that she did not admire him, and revenged himself by being as<br/>mischievous as possible. He pulled her hair whenever she came near<br/>him, upset his bread and milk to plague her when she had newly<br/>cleaned his cage, made Mop bark by pecking at him while Madam<br/>dozed, called her names before company, and behaved in all respects<br/>like an reprehensible old bird. Then she could not endure the dog,<br/>a fat, cross beast who snarled and yelped at her when she made his<br/>toilet, and who lay on his back with all his legs in the air and a<br/>most idiotic expression of countenance when he wanted something to<br/>eat, which was about a dozen times a day. The cook was<br/>bad-tempered, the old coachman was deaf, and Esther the only one<br/>who ever took any notice of the young lady.<br/><br/>Esther was a Frenchwoman, who had lived with'Madame', as she<br/>called her mistress, for many years, and who rather tyrannized over<br/>the old lady, who could not get along without her. Her real name<br/>was Estelle, but Aunt March ordered her to change it, and she<br/>obeyed, on condition that she was never asked to change her<br/>religion. She took a fancy to Mademoiselle, and amused her very<br/>much with odd stories of her life in France, when Amy sat with her<br/>while she got up Madame's laces. She also allowed her to roam about<br/>the great house, and examine the curious and pretty things stored<br/>away in the big wardrobes and the ancient chests, for Aunt March<br/>hoarded like a magpie. Amy's chief delight was an Indian cabinet,<br/>full of queer drawers, little pigeonholes, and secret places, in<br/>which were kept all sorts of ornaments, some precious, some merely<br/>curious, all more or less antique. To examine and arrange these<br/>things gave Amy great satisfaction, especially the jewel cases, in<br/>which on velvet cushions reposed the ornaments which had adorned a<br/>belle forty years ago. There was the garnet set which Aunt March<br/>wore when she came out, the pearls her father gave her on her<br/>wedding day, her lover's diamonds, the jet mourning rings and pins,<br/>the queer lockets, with portraits of dead friends and weeping<br/>willows made of hair inside, the baby bracelets her one little<br/>daughter had worn, Uncle March's big watch, with the red seal so<br/>many childish hands had played with, and in a box all by itself lay<br/>Aunt March's wedding ring, too small now for her fat finger, but<br/>put carefully away like the most precious jewel of them all.<br/><br/>"Which would Mademoiselle choose if she had her will?" asked<br/>Esther, who always sat near to watch over and lock up the<br/>valuables.<br/><br/>"I like the diamonds best, but there is no necklace among them,<br/>and I'm fond of necklaces, they are so becoming. I should choose<br/>this if I might," replied Amy, looking with great admiration at a<br/>string of gold and ebony beads from which hung a heavy cross of the<br/>same.<br/>
