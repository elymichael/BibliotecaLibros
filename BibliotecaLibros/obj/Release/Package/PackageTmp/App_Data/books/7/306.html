"Well, it does look pleasant, but I can't learn how it's done.<br/>I've tried, because one feels awkward in company not to do as<br/>everybody else is doing, but I don't seem to get on", said Jo,<br/>forgetting to play mentor.<br/><br/>"Take lessons of Amy, she has a regular talent for it."<br/><br/>"Yes, she does it very prettily, and never seems to go too far.<br/>I suppose it's natural to some people to please without trying, and<br/>others to always say and do the wrong thing in the wrong<br/>place."<br/><br/>"I'm glad you can't flirt. It's really refreshing to see a<br/>sensible, straightforward girl, who can be jolly and kind without<br/>making a fool of herself. Between ourselves, Jo, some of the girls<br/>I know really do go on at such a rate I'm ashamed of them. They<br/>don't mean any harm, I'm sure, but if they knew how we fellows<br/>talked about them afterward, they'd mend their ways, I fancy."<br/><br/>"They do the same, and as their tongues are the sharpest, you<br/>fellows get the worst of it, for you are as silly as they, every<br/>bit. If you behaved properly, they would, but knowing you like<br/>their nonsense, they keep it up, and then you blame them."<br/><br/>"Much you know about it, ma'am," said Laurie in a superior tone.<br/>"We don't like romps and flirts, though we may act as if we did<br/>sometimes. The pretty, modest girls are never talked about, except<br/>respectfully, among gentleman. Bless your innocent soul! If you<br/>could be in my place for a month you'd see things that would<br/>astonish you a trifle. Upon my word, when I see one of those<br/>harum-scarum girls, I always want to say with our friend Cock<br/>Robinâ€¦<br/><br/><br/>"Out upon you, fie upon you,<br/>Bold-faced jig!"<br/><br/><br/>It was impossible to help laughing at the funny conflict between<br/>Laurie's chivalrous reluctance to speak ill of womankind, and his<br/>very natural dislike of the unfeminine folly of which fashionable<br/>society showed him many samples. Jo knew that 'young Laurence' was<br/>regarded as a most eligible parti by worldly mamas, was much smiled<br/>upon by their daughters, and flattered enough by ladies of all ages<br/>to make a coxcomb of him, so she watched him rather jealously,<br/>fearing he would be spoiled, and rejoiced more than she confessed<br/>to find that he still believed in modest girls. Returning suddenly<br/>to her admonitory tone, she said, dropping her voice, "If you must<br/>have a 'vent', Teddy, go and devote yourself to one of the 'pretty,<br/>modest girls' whom you do respect, and not waste your time with the<br/>silly ones."<br/><br/>"You really advise it?" and Laurie looked at her with an odd<br/>mixture of anxiety and merriment in his face.<br/><br/>
