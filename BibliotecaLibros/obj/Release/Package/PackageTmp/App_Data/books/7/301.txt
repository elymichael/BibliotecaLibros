must
&#160;marry
well. Meg didn't, Jo won't, Beth can't yet, so I shall, and make
everything okay all round. I wouldn't marry a man I hated or
despised. You may be sure of that, and though Fred is not my model
hero, he does very well, and in time I should get fond enough of
him if he was very fond of me, and let me do just as I liked. So
I've been turning the matter over in my mind the last week, for it
was impossible to help seeing that Fred liked me. He said nothing,
but little things showed it. He never goes with Flo, always gets on
my side of the carriage, table, or promenade, looks sentimental
when we are alone, and frowns at anyone else who ventures to speak
to me. Yesterday at dinner, when an Austrian officer stared at us
and then said something to his friend, a rakish-looking baron,
about '
ein wonderschones Blondchen'
, Fred looked as fierce
as a lion, and cut his meat so savagely it nearly flew off his
plate. He isn't one of the cool, stiff Englishmen, but is rather
peppery, for he has Scotch blood in him, as one might guess from
his bonnie blue eyes.

Well, last evening we went up to the castle about
sunset, at least all of us but Fred, who was to meet us there after
going to the Post Restante for letters. We had a charming time
poking about the ruins, the vaults where the monster tun is, and
the beautiful gardens made by the elector long ago for his English
wife. I liked the great terrace best, for the view was divine, so
while the rest went to see the rooms inside, I sat there trying to
sketch the gray stone lion's head on the wall, with scarlet
woodbine sprays hanging round it. I felt as if I'd got into a
romance, sitting there, watching the Neckar rolling through the
valley, listening to the music of the Austrian band below, and
waiting for my lover, like a real storybook girl. I had a feeling
that something was going to happen and I was ready for it. I didn't
feel blushy or quakey, but quite cool and only a little
excited.

By-and-by I heard Fred's voice, and then he came
hurrying through the great arch to find me. He looked so troubled
that I forgot all about myself, and asked what the matter was. He
said he'd just got a letter begging him to come home, for Frank was
very ill. So he was going at once on the night train and only had
time to say good-by. I was very sorry for him, and disappointed for
myself, but only for a minute because he said, as he shook hands,
and said it in a way that I could not mistake, "I shall soon come
back, you won't forget me, Amy?"

I didn't promise, but I looked at him, and he
seemed satisfied, and there was no time for anything but messages
and good-byes, for he was off in an hour, and we all miss him very
much. I know he wanted to speak, but I think, from something he
once hinted, that he had promised his father not to do anything of
the sort yet a while, for he is a rash boy, and the old gentleman
dreads a foreign daughter-in-law. We shall soon meet in Rome, and
then, if I don't change my mind, I'll say "Yes, thank you," when he
says "Will you, please?"

Of course this is all&#160;
very private
,
but I wished you to know what was going on. Don't be anxious about
me, remember I am your 'prudent Amy', and be sure I will do nothing
rashly. Send me as much advice as you like. I'll use it if I can. I
wish I could see you for a good talk, Marmee. Love and trust
me.

Ever your AMY
