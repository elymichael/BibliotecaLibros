<br/>"Don't say that. You were very naughty, and it is hard to<br/>forgive the loss of her precious little book, but I think she might<br/>do it now, and I guess she will, if you try her at the right<br/>minute," said Meg. "Go after them. Don't say anything till Jo has<br/>got good-natured with Laurie, than take a quiet minute and just<br/>kiss her, or do some kind thing, and I'm sure she'll be friends<br/>again with all her heart."<br/><br/>"I'll try," said Amy, for the advice suited her, and after a<br/>flurry to get ready, she ran after the friends, who were just<br/>disappearing over the hill.<br/><br/>It was not far to the river, but both were ready before Amy<br/>reached them. Jo saw her coming, and turned her back. Laurie did<br/>not see, for he was carefully skating along the shore, sounding the<br/>ice, for a warm spell had preceded the cold snap.<br/><br/>"I'll go on to the first bend, and see if it's all right before<br/>we begin to race," Amy heard him say, as he shot away, looking like<br/>a young Russian in his fur-trimmed coat and cap.<br/><br/>Jo heard Amy panting after her run, stamping her feet and<br/>blowing on her fingers as she tried to put her skates on, but Jo<br/>never turned and went slowly zigzagging down the river, taking a<br/>bitter, unhappy sort of satisfaction in her sister's troubles. She<br/>had cherished her anger till it grew strong and took possession of<br/>her, as evil thoughts and feelings always do unless cast out at<br/>once. As Laurie turned the bend, he shouted back…<br/><br/>"Keep near the shore. It isn't safe in the middle." Jo heard,<br/>but Amy was struggling to her feet and did not catch a word. Jo<br/>glanced over her shoulder, and the little demon she was harboring<br/>said in her ear…<br/><br/>"No matter whether she heard or not, let her take care of<br/>herself."<br/><br/>Laurie had vanished round the bend, Jo was just at the turn, and<br/>Amy, far behind, striking out toward the smoother ice in the middle<br/>of the river. For a minute Jo stood still with a strange feeling in<br/>her heart, then she resolved to go on, but something held and<br/>turned her round, just in time to see Amy throw up her hands and go<br/>down, with a sudden crash of rotten ice, the splash of water, and a<br/>cry that made Jo's heart stand still with fear. She tried to call<br/>Laurie, but her voice was gone. She tried to rush forward, but her<br/>feet seemed to have no strength in them, and for a second, she<br/>could only stand motionless, staring with a terror-stricken face at<br/>the little blue hood above the black water. Something rushed<br/>swiftly by her, and Laurie's voice cried out…<br/><br/>"Bring a rail. Quick, quick!"<br/><br/>How she did it, she never knew, but for the next few minutes she<br/>worked as if possessed, blindly obeying Laurie, who was quite<br/>self-possessed, and lying flat, held Amy up by his arm and hockey<br/>stick till Jo dragged a rail from the fence, and together they got<br/>the child out, more frightened than hurt.<br/><br/>
