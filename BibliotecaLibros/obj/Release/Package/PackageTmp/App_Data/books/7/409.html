"I hope so, don't you, dear?"<br/><br/>"Well, my love, I consider him a trump, in the fullest sense of<br/>that expressive word, but I do wish he was a little younger and a<br/>good deal richer."<br/><br/>"Now, Laurie, don't be too fastidious and worldly-minded. If<br/>they love one another it doesn't matter a particle how old they are<br/>nor how poor. Women never should marry for money… " Amy caught<br/>herself up short as the words escaped her, and looked at her<br/>husband, who replied, with malicious gravity…<br/><br/>"Certainly not, though you do hear charming girls say that they<br/>intend to do it sometimes. If my memory serves me, you once thought<br/>it your duty to make a rich match. That accounts, perhaps, for your<br/>marrying a good-for-nothing like me."<br/><br/>"Oh, my dearest boy, don't, don't say that! I forgot you were<br/>rich when I said 'Yes'. I'd have married you if you hadn't a penny,<br/>and I sometimes wish you were poor that I might show how much I<br/>love you." And Amy, who was very dignified in public and very fond<br/>in private, gave convincing proofs of the truth of her words.<br/><br/>"You don't really think I am such a mercenary creature as I<br/>tried to be once, do you? It would break my heart if you didn't<br/>believe that I'd gladly pull in the same boat with you, even if you<br/>had to get your living by rowing on the lake."<br/><br/>"Am I an idiot and a brute? How could I think so, when you<br/>refused a richer man for me, and won't let me give you half I want<br/>to now, when I have the right? Girls do it every day, poor things,<br/>and are taught to think it is their only salvation, but you had<br/>better lessons, and though I trembled for you at one time, I was<br/>not disappointed, for the daughter was true to the mother's<br/>teaching. I told Mamma so yesterday, and she looked as glad and<br/>grateful as if I'd given her a check for a million, to be spent in<br/>charity. You are not listening to my moral remarks, Mrs. Laurence,"<br/>and Laurie paused, for Amy's eyes had an absent look, though fixed<br/>upon his face.<br/><br/>"Yes, I am, and admiring the mole in your chin at the same time.<br/>I don't wish to make you vain, but I must confess that I'm prouder<br/>of my handsome husband than of all his money. Don't laugh, but your<br/>nose is such a comfort to me," and Amy softly caressed the well-cut<br/>feature with artistic satisfaction.<br/><br/>Laurie had received many compliments in his life, but never one<br/>that suited him better, as he plainly showed though he did laugh at<br/>his wife's peculiar taste, while she said slowly, "May I ask you a<br/>question, dear?"<br/><br/>"Of course, you may."<br/><br/>"Shall you care if Jo does marry Mr. Bhaer?"<br/>
