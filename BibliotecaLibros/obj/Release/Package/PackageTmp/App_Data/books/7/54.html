<br/>"Just her father's way of doing good. I shall come and see your<br/>mother some fine day. Tell her so. There's the tea bell, we have it<br/>early on the boy's account. Come down and go on being<br/>neighborly."<br/><br/>"If you'd like to have me, sir."<br/><br/>"Shouldn't ask you, if I didn't." And Mr. Laurence offered her<br/>his arm with old-fashioned courtesy.<br/><br/>"What would Meg say to this?" thought Jo, as she was marched<br/>away, while her eyes danced with fun as she imagined herself<br/>telling the story at home.<br/><br/>"Hey! Why, what the dickens has come to the fellow?" said the<br/>old gentleman, as Laurie came running downstairs and brought up<br/>with a start of surprise at the astounding sight of Jo arm in arm<br/>with his redoubtable grandfather.<br/><br/>"I didn't know you'd come, sir," he began, as Jo gave him a<br/>triumphant little glance.<br/><br/>"That's evident, by the way you racket downstairs. Come to your<br/>tea, sir, and behave like a gentleman." And having pulled the boy's<br/>hair by way of a caress, Mr. Laurence walked on, while Laurie went<br/>through a series of comic evolutions behind their backs, which<br/>nearly produced an explosion of laughter from Jo.<br/><br/>The old gentleman did not say much as he drank his four cups of<br/>tea, but he watched the young people, who soon chatted away like<br/>old friends, and the change in his grandson did not escape him.<br/>There was color, light, and life in the boy's face now, vivacity in<br/>his manner, and genuine merriment in his laugh.<br/><br/>"She's right, the lad is lonely. I'll see what these little<br/>girls can do for him," thought Mr. Laurence, as he looked and<br/>listened. He liked Jo, for her odd, blunt ways suited him, and she<br/>seemed to understand the boy almost as well as if she had been one<br/>herself.<br/><br/>If the Laurences had been what Jo called 'prim and poky', she<br/>would not have got on at all, for such people always made her shy<br/>and awkward. But finding them free and easy, she was so herself,<br/>and made a good impression. When they rose she proposed to go, but<br/>Laurie said he had something more to show her, and took her away to<br/>the conservatory, which had been lighted for her benefit. It seemed<br/>quite fairylike to Jo, as she went up and down the walks, enjoying<br/>the blooming walls on either side, the soft light, the damp sweet<br/>air, and the wonderful vines and trees that hung about her, while<br/>her new friend cut the finest flowers till his hands were full.<br/>Then he tied them up, saying, with the happy look Jo liked to see,<br/>"Please give these to your mother, and tell her I like the medicine<br/>she sent me very much."<br/><br/>
