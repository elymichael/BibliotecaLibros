<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>2<br/>A<br/>Merry Christmas<br/><br/><br/>Jo was the first to wake in the gray dawn of Christmas morning.<br/>No stockings hung at the fireplace, and for a moment she felt as<br/>much disappointed as she did long ago, when her little sock fell<br/>down because it was crammed so full of goodies. Then she remembered<br/>her mother's promise and, slipping her hand under her pillow, drew<br/>out a little crimson-covered book. She knew it very well, for it<br/>was that beautiful old story of the best life ever lived, and Jo<br/>felt that it was a true guidebook for any pilgrim going on a long<br/>journey. She woke Meg with a "Merry Christmas," and bade her see<br/>what was under her pillow. A green-covered book appeared, with the<br/>same picture inside, and a few words written by their mother, which<br/>made their one present very precious in their eyes. Presently Beth<br/>and Amy woke to rummage and find their little books also, one<br/>dove-colored, the other blue, and all sat looking at and talking<br/>about them, while the east grew rosy with the coming day.<br/><br/>In spite of her small vanities, Margaret had a sweet and pious<br/>nature, which unconsciously influenced her sisters, especially Jo,<br/>who loved her very tenderly, and obeyed her because her advice was<br/>so gently given.<br/><br/>"Girls," said Meg seriously, looking from the tumbled head<br/>beside her to the two little night-capped ones in the room beyond,<br/>"Mother wants us to read and love and mind these books, and we must<br/>begin at once. We used to be faithful about it, but since Father<br/>went away and all this war trouble unsettled us, we have neglected<br/>many things. You can do as you please, but I shall keep my book on<br/>the table here and read a little every morning as soon as I wake,<br/>for I know it will do me good and help me through the day."<br/><br/>Then she opened her new book and began to read. Jo put her arm<br/>round her and, leaning cheek to cheek, read also, with the quiet<br/>expression so seldom seen on her restless face.<br/><br/>"How good Meg is! Come, Amy, let's do as they do. I'll help you<br/>with the hard words, and they'll explain things if we don't<br/>understand," whispered Beth, very much impressed by the pretty<br/>books and her sisters' example.<br/><br/>"I'm glad mine is blue," said Amy. and then the rooms were very<br/>still while the pages were softly turned, and the winter sunshine<br/>crept in to touch the bright heads and serious faces with a<br/>Christmas greeting.<br/><br/>"Where is Mother?" asked Meg, as she and Jo ran down to thank<br/>her for their gifts, half an hour later.<br/>
