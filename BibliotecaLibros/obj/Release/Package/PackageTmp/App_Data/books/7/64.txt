Amyâ€™s Valley of Humiliation


"That boy is a perfect cyclops, isn't he?" said Amy one day, as
Laurie clattered by on horseback, with a flourish of his whip as he
passed.

"How dare you say so, when he's got both his eyes? And very
handsome ones they are, too," cried Jo, who resented any slighting
remarks about her friend.

"I didn't say anything about his eyes, and I don't see why you
need fire up when I admire his riding."

"Oh, my goodness! That little goose means a centaur, and she
called him a Cyclops," exclaimed Jo, with a burst of laughter.

"You needn't be so rude, it's only a 'lapse of lingy', as Mr.
Davis says," retorted Amy, finishing Jo with her Latin. "I just
wish I had a little of the money Laurie spends on that horse," she
added, as if to herself, yet hoping her sisters would hear.

"Why?" asked Meg kindly, for Jo had gone off in another laugh at
Amy's second blunder.

"I need it so much. I'm dreadfully in debt, and it won't be my
turn to have the rag money for a month."
