<br/>"We were in the Slough of Despond tonight, and Mother came and<br/>pulled us out as Help did in the book. We ought to have our roll of<br/>directions, like Christian. What shall we do about that?" asked Jo,<br/>delighted with the fancy which lent a little romance to the very<br/>dull task of doing her duty.<br/><br/>"Look under your pillows Christmas morning, and you will find<br/>your guidebook," replied Mrs. March.<br/><br/>They talked over the new plan while old Hannah cleared the<br/>table, then out came the four little work baskets, and the needles<br/>flew as the girls made sheets for Aunt March. It was uninteresting<br/>sewing, but tonight no one grumbled. They adopted Jo's plan of<br/>dividing the long seams into four parts, and calling the quarters<br/>Europe, Asia, Africa, and America, and in that way got on<br/>capitally, especially when they talked about the different<br/>countries as they stitched their way through them.<br/><br/>At nine they stopped work, and sang, as usual, before they went<br/>to bed. No one but Beth could get much music out of the old piano,<br/>but she had a way of softly touching the yellow keys and making a<br/>pleasant accompaniment to the simple songs they sang. Meg had a<br/>voice like a flute, and she and her mother led the little choir.<br/>Amy chirped like a cricket, and Jo wandered through the airs at her<br/>own sweet will, always coming out at the wrong place with a croak<br/>or a quaver that spoiled the most pensive tune. They had always<br/>done this from the time they could lispâ€¦<br/><br/><br/>Crinkle, crinkle, 'ittle 'tar,<br/><br/><br/>and it had become a household custom, for the<br/>mother was a born singer. The first sound in the morning was her<br/>voice as she went about the house singing like a lark, and the last<br/>sound at night was the same cheery sound, for the girls never grew<br/>too old for that familiar lullaby.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
