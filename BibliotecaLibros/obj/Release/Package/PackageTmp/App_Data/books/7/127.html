"Jo can," said Meg, glad to recommend her sister. So Jo, feeling<br/>that her late lessons in cookery were to do her honor, went to<br/>preside over the coffeepot, while the children collected dry<br/>sticks, and the boys made a fire and got water from a spring near<br/>by. Miss Kate sketched and Frank talked to Beth, who was making<br/>little mats of braided rushes to serve as plates.<br/><br/>The commander in chief and his aides soon spread the tablecloth<br/>with an inviting array of eatables and drinkables, prettily<br/>decorated with green leaves. Jo announced that the coffee was<br/>ready, and everyone settled themselves to a hearty meal, for youth<br/>is seldom dyspeptic, and exercise develops wholesome appetites. A<br/>very merry lunch it was, for everything seemed fresh and funny, and<br/>frequent peals of laughter startled a venerable horse who fed near<br/>by. There was a pleasing inequality in the table, which produced<br/>many mishaps to cups and plates, acorns dropped in the milk, little<br/>black ants partook of the refreshments without being invited, and<br/>fuzzy caterpillars swung down from the tree to see what was going<br/>on. Three white-headed children peeped over the fence, and an<br/>objectionable dog barked at them from the other side of the river<br/>with all his might and main.<br/><br/>"There's salt here," said Laurie, as he handed Jo a saucer of<br/>berries.<br/><br/>"Thank you, I prefer spiders," she replied, fishing up two<br/>unwary little ones who had gone to a creamy death. "How dare you<br/>remind me of that horrid dinner party, when yours is so nice in<br/>every way?" added Jo, as they both laughed and ate out of one<br/>plate, the china having run short.<br/><br/>"I had an uncommonly good time that day, and haven't got over it<br/>yet. This is no credit to me, you know, I don't do anything. It's<br/>you and Meg and Brooke who make it all go, and I'm no end obliged<br/>to you. What shall we do when we can't eat anymore?" asked Laurie,<br/>feeling that his trump card had been played when lunch was<br/>over.<br/><br/>"Have games till it's cooler. I brought Authors, and I dare say<br/>Miss Kate knows something new and nice. Go and ask her. She's<br/>company, and you ought to stay with her more."<br/><br/>"Aren't you company too? I thought she'd suit Brooke, but he<br/>keeps talking to Meg, and Kate just stares at them through that<br/>ridiculous glass of hers. I'm going, so you needn't try to preach<br/>propriety, for you can't do it, Jo."<br/><br/>Miss Kate did know several new games, and as the girls would<br/>not, and the boys could not, eat any more, they all adjourned to<br/>the drawing room to play Rig-marole.<br/><br/>"One person begins a story, any nonsense you like, and tells as<br/>long as he pleases, only taking care to stop short at some exciting<br/>point, when the next takes it up and does the same. It's very funny<br/>when well done, and makes a perfect jumble of tragical comical<br/>stuff to laugh over. Please start it, Mr. Brooke," said Kate, with<br/>a commanding air, which surprised Meg, who treated the tutor with<br/>as much respect as any other gentleman.<br/><br/>Lying on the grass at the feet of the two young ladies, Mr.<br/>Brooke obediently began the story, with the handsome brown eyes<br/>steadily fixed upon the sunshiny river.<br/><br/>"Once on a time, a knight went out into the world to seek his<br/>fortune, for he had nothing but his sword and his shield. He<br/>traveled a long while, nearly eight-and-twenty years, and had a<br/>hard time of it, till he came to the palace of a good old king, who<br/>had offered a reward to anyone who could tame and train a fine but<br/>unbroken colt, of which he was very fond. The knight agreed to try,<br/>and got on slowly but surely, for the colt was a gallant fellow,<br/>and soon learned to love his new master, though he was freakish and<br/>wild. Every day, when he gave his lessons to this pet of the<br/>king's, the knight rode him through the city, and as he rode, he<br/>looked everywhere for a certain beautiful face, which he had seen<br/>many times in his dreams, but never found. One day, as he went<br/>prancing down a quiet street, he saw at the window of a ruinous<br/>castle the lovely face. He was delighted, inquired who lived in<br/>this old castle, and was told that several captive princesses were<br/>kept there by a spell, and spun all day to lay up money to buy<br/>their liberty. The knight wished intensely that he could free them,<br/>but he was poor and could only go by each day, watching for the<br/>sweet face and longing to see it out in the sunshine. At last he<br/>resolved to get into the castle and ask how he could help them. He<br/>went and knocked. The great door flew open, and he beheldâ€¦ "<br/>
