"About Meg?"<br/><br/>"How quickly you guessed! Yes, it's about her, and though it's a<br/>little thing, it fidgets me."<br/><br/>"Beth is asleep. Speak low, and tell me all about it. That<br/>Moffat hasn't been here, I hope?" asked Mrs. March rather<br/>sharply.<br/><br/>"No. I should have shut the door in his face if he had," said<br/>Jo, settling herself on the floor at her mother's feet. "Last<br/>summer Meg left a pair of gloves over at the Laurences' and only<br/>one was returned. We forgot about it, till Teddy told me that Mr.<br/>Brooke owned that he liked Meg but didn't dare say so, she was so<br/>young and he so poor. Now, isn't it a dreadful state of<br/>things?"<br/><br/>"Do you think Meg cares for him?" asked Mrs. March, with an<br/>anxious look.<br/><br/>"Mercy me! I don't know anything about love and such nonsense!"<br/>cried Jo, with a funny mixture of interest and contempt. "In<br/>novels, the girls show it by starting and blushing, fainting away,<br/>growing thin, and acting like fools. Now Meg does not do anything<br/>of the sort. She eats and drinks and sleeps like a sensible<br/>creature, she looks straight in my face when I talk about that man,<br/>and only blushes a little bit when Teddy jokes about lovers. I<br/>forbid him to do it, but he doesn't mind me as he ought."<br/><br/>"Then you fancy that Meg is not interested in John?"<br/><br/>"Who?" cried Jo, staring.<br/><br/>"Mr. Brooke. I call him 'John' now. We fell into the way of<br/>doing so at the hospital, and he likes it."<br/><br/>"Oh, dear! I know you'll take his part. He's been good to<br/>Father, and you won't send him away, but let Meg marry him, if she<br/>wants to. Mean thing! To go petting Papa and helping you, just to<br/>wheedle you into liking him." And Jo pulled her hair again with a<br/>wrathful tweak.<br/><br/>"My dear, don't get angry about it, and I will tell you how it<br/>happened. John went with me at Mr. Laurence's request, and was so<br/>devoted to poor Father that we couldn't help getting fond of him.<br/>He was perfectly open and honorable about Meg, for he told us he<br/>loved her, but would earn a comfortable home before he asked her to<br/>marry him. He only wanted our leave to love her and work for her,<br/>and the right to make her love him if he could. He is a truly<br/>excellent young man, and we could not refuse to listen to him, but<br/>I will not consent to Meg's engaging herself so young."<br/>
