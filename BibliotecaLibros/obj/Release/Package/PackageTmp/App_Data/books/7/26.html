So Meg went away to 'accept with thanks', look over her dress,<br/>and sing blithely as she did up her one real lace frill, while Jo<br/>finished her story, her four apples, and had a game of romps with<br/>Scrabble.<br/><br/>On New Year's Eve the parlor was deserted, for the two younger<br/>girls played dressing maids and the two elder were absorbed in the<br/>all-important business of 'getting ready for the party'. Simple as<br/>the toilets were, there was a great deal of running up and down,<br/>laughing and talking, and at one time a strong smell of burned hair<br/>pervaded the house. Meg wanted a few curls about her face, and Jo<br/>undertook to pinch the papered locks with a pair of hot tongs.<br/><br/>"Ought they to smoke like that?" asked Beth from her perch on<br/>the bed.<br/><br/>"It's the dampness drying," replied Jo.<br/><br/>"What a queer smell! It's like burned feathers," observed Amy,<br/>smoothing her own pretty curls with a superior air.<br/><br/>"There, now I'll take off the papers and you'll see a cloud of<br/>little ringlets," said Jo, putting down the tongs.<br/><br/>She did take off the papers, but no cloud of ringlets appeared,<br/>for the hair came with the papers, and the horrified hairdresser<br/>laid a row of little scorched bundles on the bureau before her<br/>victim.<br/><br/>"Oh, oh, oh! What have you done? I'm spoiled! I can't go! My<br/>hair, oh, my hair!" wailed Meg, looking with despair at the uneven<br/>frizzle on her forehead.<br/><br/>"Just my luck! You shouldn't have asked me to do it. I always<br/>spoil everything. I'm so sorry, but the tongs were too hot, and so<br/>I've made a mess," groaned poor Jo, regarding the little black<br/>pancakes with tears of regret.<br/><br/>"It isn't spoiled. Just frizzle it, and tie your ribbon so the<br/>ends come on your forehead a bit, and it will look like the last<br/>fashion. I've seen many girls do it so," said Amy consolingly.<br/><br/>"Serves me right for trying to be fine. I wish I'd let my hair<br/>alone," cried Meg petulantly.<br/>
