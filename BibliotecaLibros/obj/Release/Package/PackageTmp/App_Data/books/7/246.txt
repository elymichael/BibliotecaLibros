"You won't see me, you'll be crying so hard that the thick fog
round you will obscure the prospect."

"I never cry unless for some great affliction."

"Such as fellows going to college, hey?" cut in Laurie, with
suggestive laugh.

"Don't be a peacock. I only moaned a trifle to keep the girls
company."

"Exactly. I say, Jo, how is Grandpa this week? Pretty
amiable?"

"Very. Why, have you got into a scrape and want to know how
he'll take it?" asked Jo rather sharply.

"Now, Jo, do you think I'd look your mother in the face and say
'All right', if it wasn't?" and Laurie stopped short, with an
injured air.

"No, I don't."

"Then don't go and be suspicious. I only want some money," said
Laurie, walking on again, appeased by her hearty tone.

"You spend a great deal, Teddy."

"Bless you, I don't spend it, it spends itself somehow, and is
gone before I know it."
