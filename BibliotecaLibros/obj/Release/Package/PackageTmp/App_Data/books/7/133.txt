"Well, I think Truth is a very silly play. Let's have a sensible
game of Authors to refresh our minds," proposed Jo.

Ned, Frank, and the little girls joined in this, and while it
went on, the three elders sat apart, talking. Miss Kate took out
her sketch again, and Margaret watched her, while Mr. Brooke lay on
the grass with a book, which he did not read.

"How beautifully you do it! I wish I could draw," said Meg, with
mingled admiration and regret in her voice.

"Why don't you learn? I should think you had taste and talent
for it," replied Miss Kate graciously.

"I haven't time."

"Your mamma prefers other accomplishments, I fancy. So did mine,
but I proved to her that I had talent by taking a few lessons
privately, and then she was quite willing I should go on. Can't you
do the same with your governess?"

"I have none."

"I forgot young ladies in America go to school more than with
us. Very fine schools they are, too, Papa says. You go to a private
one, I suppose?"

"I don't go at all. I am a governess myself."

"Oh, indeed!" said Miss Kate, but she might as well have said,
"Dear me, how dreadful!" for her tone implied it, and something in
her face made Meg color, and wish she had not been so frank.

Mr. Brooke looked up and said quickly, "Young ladies in America
love independence as much as their ancestors did, and are admired
and respected for supporting themselves."
