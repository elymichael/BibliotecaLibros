<br/>A daughter of the gods,<br/>Devinely tall, and most devinely fair,"<br/><br/><br/>was all the satisfaction she got, however.<br/><br/>The set in which they found themselves was composed of English,<br/>and Amy was compelled to walk decorously through a cotillion,<br/>feeling all the while as if she could dance the tarantella with<br/>relish. Laurie resigned her to the 'nice little boy', and went to<br/>do his duty to Flo, without securing Amy for the joys to come,<br/>which reprehensible want of forethought was properly punished, for<br/>she immediately engaged herself till supper, meaning to relent if<br/>he then gave any signs penitence. She showed him her ball book with<br/>demure satisfaction when he strolled instead of rushed up to claim<br/>her for the next, a glorious polka redowa. But his polite regrets<br/>didn't impose upon her, and when she galloped away with the Count,<br/>she saw Laurie sit down by her aunt with an actual expression of<br/>relief.<br/><br/>That was unpardonable, and Amy took no more notice of him for a<br/>long while, except a word now and then when she came to her<br/>chaperon between the dances for a necessary pin or a moment's rest.<br/>Her anger had a good effect, however, for she hid it under a<br/>smiling face, and seemed unusually blithe and brilliant. Laurie's<br/>eyes followed her with pleasure, for she neither romped nor<br/>sauntered, but danced with spirit and grace, making the delightsome<br/>pastime what it should be. He very naturally fell to studying her<br/>from this new point of view, and before the evening was half over,<br/>had decided that 'little Amy was going to make a very charming<br/>woman'.<br/><br/>It was a lively scene, for soon the spirit of the social season<br/>took possession of everyone, and Christmas merriment made all faces<br/>shine, hearts happy, and heels light. The musicians fiddled,<br/>tooted, and banged as if they enjoyed it, everybody danced who<br/>could, and those who couldn't admired their neighbors with uncommon<br/>warmth. The air was dark with Davises, and many Joneses gamboled<br/>like a flock of young giraffes. The golden secretary darted through<br/>the room like a meteor with a dashing French-woman who carpeted the<br/>floor with her pink satin train. The serene Teuton found the<br/>supper-table and was happy, eating steadily through the bill of<br/>fare, and dismayed the garcons by the ravages he committed. But the<br/>Emperor's friend covered himself with glory, for he danced<br/>everything, whether he knew it or not, and introduced impromptu<br/>pirouettes when the figures bewildered him. The boyish abandon of<br/>that stout man was charming to behold, for though he 'carried<br/>weight', he danced like an India-rubber ball. He ran, he flew, he<br/>pranced, his face glowed, his bald head shown, his coattails waved<br/>wildly, his pumps actually twinkled in the air, and when the music<br/>stopped, he wiped the drops from his brow, and beamed upon his<br/>fellow men like a French Pickwick without glasses.<br/><br/>Amy and her Pole distinguished themselves by equal enthusiasm<br/>but more graceful agility, and Laurie found himself involuntarily<br/>keeping time to the rhythmic rise and fall of the white slippers as<br/>they flew by as indefatigably as if winged. When little Vladimir<br/>finally relinquished her, with assurances that he was 'desolated to<br/>leave so early', she was ready to rest, and see how her recreant<br/>knight had borne his punishment.<br/><br/>It had been successful, for at three-and-twenty, blighted<br/>affections find a balm in friendly society, and young nerves will<br/>thrill, young blood dance, and healthy young spirits rise, when<br/>subjected to the enchantment of beauty, light, music, and motion.<br/>Laurie had a waked-up look as he rose to give her his seat, and<br/>when he hurried away to bring her some supper, she said to herself,<br/>with a satisfied smile, "Ah, I thought that would do him good!"<br/><br/>"You look like Balzac's '<br/>Femme Peinte Par Elle-Meme<br/>',"<br/>he said, as he fanned her with one hand and held her coffee cup in<br/>the other.<br/><br/>
