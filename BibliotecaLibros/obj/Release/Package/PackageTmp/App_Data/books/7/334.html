<br/>"That you love that old man."<br/><br/>"What old man?" demanded Jo, thinking he must mean his<br/>grandfather.<br/><br/>"That devilish Professor you were always writing about. If you<br/>say you love him, I know I shall do something desperate;" and he<br/>looked as if he would keep his word, as he clenched his hands with<br/>a wrathful spark in his eyes.<br/><br/>Jo wanted to laugh, but restrained herself and said warmly, for<br/>she too, was getting excited with all this, "Don't swear, Teddy! He<br/>isn't old, nor anything bad, but good and kind, and the best friend<br/>I've got, next to you. Pray, don't fly into a passion. I want to be<br/>kind, but I know I shall get angry if you abuse my Professor. I<br/>haven't the least idea of loving him or anybody else."<br/><br/>"But you will after a while, and then what will become of<br/>me?"<br/><br/>"You'll love someone else too, like a sensible boy, and forget<br/>all this trouble."<br/><br/>"I can't love anyone else, and I'll never forget you, Jo, Never!<br/>Never!" with a stamp to emphasize his passionate words.<br/><br/>"What shall I do with him?" sighed Jo, finding that emotions<br/>were more unmanagable than she expected. "You haven't heard what I<br/>wanted to tell you. Sit down and listen, for indeed I want to do<br/>right and make you happy," she said, hoping to soothe him with a<br/>little reason, which proved that she knew nothing about love.<br/><br/>Seeing a ray of hope in that last speech, Laurie threw himself<br/>down on the grass at her feet, leaned his arm on the lower step of<br/>the stile, and looked up at her with an expectant face. Now that<br/>arrangement was not conducive to calm speech or clear thought on<br/>Jo's part, for how could she say hard things to her boy while he<br/>watched her with eyes full of love and longing, and lashes still<br/>wet with the bitter drop or two her hardness of heart had wrung<br/>from him? She gently turned his head away, saying, as she stroked<br/>the wavy hair which had been allowed to grow for her sake—how<br/>touching that was, to be sure! "I agree with Mother that you and I<br/>are not suited to each other, because our quick tempers and strong<br/>wills would probably make us very miserable, if we were so foolish<br/>as to… " Jo paused a little over the last word, but Laurie uttered<br/>it with a rapturous expression.<br/><br/>"Marry—no we shouldn't! If you loved me, Jo, I should be a<br/>perfect saint, for you could make me anything you like."<br/><br/>
