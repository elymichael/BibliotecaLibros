Dear girls,<br/><br/>In my last I told you about our London visit, how<br/>kind the Vaughns were, and what pleasant parties they made for us.<br/>I enjoyed the trips to Hampton Court and the Kensington Museum more<br/>than anything else, for at Hampton I saw Raphael's cartoons, and at<br/>the Museum, rooms full of pictures by Turner, Lawrence, Reynolds,<br/>Hogarth, and the other great creatures. The day in Richmond Park<br/>was charming, for we had a regular English picnic, and I had more<br/>splendid oaks and groups of deer than I could copy, also heard a<br/>nightingale, and saw larks go up. We 'did' London to our heart's<br/>content, thanks to Fred and Frank, and were sorry to go away, for<br/>though English people are slow to take you in, when they once make<br/>up their minds to do it they cannot be outdone in hospitality, I<br/>think. The Vaughns hope to meet us in Rome next winter, and I shall<br/>be dreadfully disappointed if they don't, for Grace and I are great<br/>friends, and the boys very nice fellows, especially Fred.<br/><br/>Well, we were hardly settled here, when he turned<br/>up again, saying he had come for a holiday, and was going to<br/>Switzerland. Aunt looked sober at first, but he was so cool about<br/>it she couldn't say a word. And now we get on nicely, and are very<br/>glad he came, for he speaks French like a native, and I don't know<br/>what we should do without him. Uncle doesn't know ten words, and<br/>insists on talking English very loud, as if it would make people<br/>understand him. Aunt's pronunciation is old-fashioned, and Flo and<br/>I, though we flattered ourselves that we knew a good deal, find we<br/>don't, and are very grateful to have Fred do the '<br/>parley<br/>vooing<br/>', as Uncle calls it.<br/><br/>Such delightful times as we are having!<br/>Sight-seeing from morning till night, stopping for nice lunches in<br/>the gay&#160;<br/>cafes<br/>, and meeting with all sorts of droll<br/>adventures. Rainy days I spend in the Louvre, revelling in<br/>pictures. Jo would turn up her naughty nose at some of the finest,<br/>because she has no soul for art, but I have, and I'm cultivating<br/>eye and taste as fast as I can. She would like the relics of great<br/>people better, for I've seen her Napoleon's cocked hat and gray<br/>coat, his baby's cradle and his old toothbrush, also Marie<br/>Antoinette's little shoe, the ring of Saint Denis, Charlemagne's<br/>sword, and many other interesting things. I'll talk for hours about<br/>them when I come, but haven't time to write.<br/><br/>The Palais Royale is a heavenly place, so full<br/>of&#160;<br/>bijouterie<br/>&#160;and lovely things that I'm nearly<br/>distracted because I can't buy them. Fred wanted to get me some,<br/>but of course I didn't allow it. Then the Bois and Champs Elysees<br/>are&#160;<br/>tres magnifique<br/>. I've seen the imperial family<br/>several times, the emperor an ugly, hard-looking man, the empress<br/>pale and pretty, but dressed in bad taste, I thought—purple dress,<br/>green hat, and yellow gloves. Little Nap is a handsome boy, who<br/>sits chatting to his tutor, and kisses his hand to the people as he<br/>passes in his four-horse barouche, with postilions in red satin<br/>jackets and a mounted guard before and behind.<br/><br/>We often walk in the Tuileries Gardens, for they<br/>are lovely, though the antique Luxembourg Gardens suit me better.<br/>Pere la Chaise is very curious, for many of the tombs are like<br/>small rooms, and looking in, one sees a table, with images or<br/>pictures of the dead, and chairs for the mourners to sit in when<br/>they come to lament. That is so Frenchy.<br/><br/>Our rooms are on the Rue de Rivoli, and sitting<br/>on the balcony, we look up and down the long, brilliant street. It<br/>is so pleasant that we spend our evenings talking there when too<br/>tired with our day's work to go out. Fred is very entertaining, and<br/>is altogether the most agreeable young man I ever knew—except<br/>Laurie, whose manners are more charming. I wish Fred was dark, for<br/>I don't fancy light men, however, the Vaughns are very rich and<br/>come of an excellent family, so I won't find fault with their<br/>yellow hair, as my own is yellower.<br/>
