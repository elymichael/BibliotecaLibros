"Use the chicken then, the toughness won't matter in a salad,"<br/>advised his wife.<br/><br/>"Hannah left it on the kitchen table a minute, and the kittens<br/>got at it. I'm very sorry, Amy," added Beth, who was still a<br/>patroness of cats.<br/><br/>"Then I must have a lobster, for tongue alone won't do," said<br/>Amy decidedly.<br/><br/>"Shall I rush into town and demand one?" asked Jo, with the<br/>magnanimity of a martyr.<br/><br/>"You'd come bringing it home under your arm without any paper,<br/>just to try me. I'll go myself," answered Amy, whose temper was<br/>beginning to fail.<br/><br/>Shrouded in a thick veil and armed with a genteel traveling<br/>basket, she departed, feeling that a cool drive would soothe her<br/>ruffled spirit and fit her for the labors of the day. After some<br/>delay, the object of her desire was procured, likewise a bottle of<br/>dressing to prevent further loss of time at home, and off she drove<br/>again, well pleased with her own forethought.<br/><br/>As the omnibus contained only one other passenger, a sleepy old<br/>lady, Amy pocketed her veil and beguiled the tedium of the way by<br/>trying to find out where all her money had gone to. So busy was she<br/>with her card full of refractory figures that she did not observe a<br/>newcomer, who entered without stopping the vehicle, till a<br/>masculine voice said, "Good morning, Miss March," and, looking up,<br/>she beheld one of Laurie's most elegant college friends. Fervently<br/>hoping that he would get out before she did, Amy utterly ignored<br/>the basket at her feet, and congratulating herself that she had on<br/>her new traveling dress, returned the young man's greeting with her<br/>usual suavity and spirit.<br/><br/>They got on excellently, for Amy's chief care was soon set at<br/>rest by learning that the gentleman would leave first, and she was<br/>chatting away in a peculiarly lofty strain, when the old lady got<br/>out. In stumbling to the door, she upset the basket, and—oh<br/>horror!—the lobster, in all its vulgar size and brilliancy, was<br/>revealed to the highborn eyes of a Tudor!<br/><br/>"By Jove, she's forgotten her dinner!" cried the unconscious<br/>youth, poking the scarlet monster into its place with his cane, and<br/>preparing to hand out the basket after the old lady.<br/><br/>"Please don't—it's—it's mine," murmured Amy, with a face nearly<br/>as red as her fish.<br/><br/>"Oh, really, I beg pardon. It's an uncommonly fine one, isn't<br/>it?" said Tudor, with great presence of mind, and an air of sober<br/>interest that did credit to his breeding.<br/>
