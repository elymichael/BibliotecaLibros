"Nothing more, except that I don't believe I shall ever marry.
I'm happy as I am, and love my liberty too well to be in a hurry to
give it up for any mortal man."

"I know better!" broke in Laurie. "You think so now, but
there'll come a time when you will care for somebody, and you'll
love him tremendously, and live and die for him. I know you will,
it's your way, and I shall have to stand by and see it," and the
despairing lover cast his hat upon the ground with a gesture that
would have seemed comical, if his face had not been so tragic.

"Yes, I will live and die for him, if he ever comes and makes me
love him in spite of myself, and you must do the best you can!"
cried Jo, losing patience with poor Teddy. "I've done my best, but
you won't be reasonable, and it's selfish of you to keep teasing
for what I can't give. I shall always be fond of you, very fond
indeed, as a friend, but I'll never marry you, and the sooner you
believe it the better for both of usâ€”so now!"

That speech was like gunpowder. Laurie looked at her a minute as
if he did not quite know what to do with himself, then turned
sharply away, saying in a desperate sort of tone, "You'll be sorry
some day, Jo."

"Oh, where are you going?" she cried, for his face frightened
her.

"To the devil!" was the consoling answer.

For a minute Jo's heart stood still, as he swung himself down
the bank toward the river, but it takes much folly, sin or misery
to send a young man to a violent death, and Laurie was not one of
the weak sort who are conquered by a single failure. He had no
thought of a melodramatic plunge, but some blind instinct led him
to fling hat and coat into his boat, and row away with all his
might, making better time up the river than he had done in any
race. Jo drew a long breath and unclasped her hands as she watched
the poor fellow trying to outstrip the trouble which he carried in
his heart.

"That will do him good, and he'll come home in such a tender,
penitent state of mind, that I shan't dare to see him," she said,
adding, as she went slowly home, feeling as if she had murdered
some innocent thing, and buried it under the leaves. "Now I must go
and prepare Mr. Laurence to be very kind to my poor boy. I wish
he'd love Beth, perhaps he may in time, but I begin to think I was
mistaken about her. Oh dear! How can girls like to have lovers and
refuse them? I think it's dreadful."

Being sure that no one could do it so well as herself, she went
straight to Mr. Laurence, told the hard story bravely through, and
then broke down, crying so dismally over her own insensibility that
the kind old gentleman, though sorely disappointed, did not utter a
reproach. He found it difficult to understand how any girl could
help loving Laurie, and hoped she would change her mind, but he
knew even better than Jo that love cannot be forced, so he shook
his head sadly and resolved to carry his boy out of harm's way, for
Young Impetuosity's parting words to Jo disturbed him more than he
would confess.

When Laurie came home, dead tired but quite composed, his
grandfather met him as if he knew nothing, and kept up the delusion
very successfully for an hour or two. But when they sat together in
the twilight, the time they used to enjoy so much, it was hard work
for the old man to ramble on as usual, and harder still for the
young one to listen to praises of the last year's success, which to
him now seemed like love's labor lost. He bore it as long as he
could, then went to his piano and began to play. The window's were
open, and Jo, walking in the garden with Beth, for once understood
music better than her sister, for he played the '
Sonata
Pathetique
