<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>8<br/>Jo<br/>Meets Apollyon<br/><br/><br/>"Girls, where are you going?" asked Amy, coming into their room<br/>one Saturday afternoon, and finding them getting ready to go out<br/>with an air of secrecy which excited her curiosity.<br/><br/>"Never mind. Little girls shouldn't ask questions," returned Jo<br/>sharply.<br/><br/>Now if there is anything mortifying to our feelings when we are<br/>young, it is to be told that, and to be bidden to "run away, dear"<br/>is still more trying to us. Amy bridled up at this insult, and<br/>determined to find out the secret, if she teased for an hour.<br/>Turning to Meg, who never refused her anything very long, she said<br/>coaxingly, "Do tell me! I should think you might let me go, too,<br/>for Beth is fussing over her piano, and I haven't got anything to<br/>do, and am so lonely."<br/><br/>"I can't, dear, because you aren't invited," began Meg, but Jo<br/>broke in impatiently, "Now, Meg, be quiet or you will spoil it all.<br/>You can't go, Amy, so don't be a baby and whine about it."<br/><br/>"You are going somewhere with Laurie, I know you are. You were<br/>whispering and laughing together on the sofa last night, and you<br/>stopped when I came in. Aren't you going with him?"<br/><br/>"Yes, we are. Now do be still, and stop bothering."<br/><br/>Amy held her tongue, but used her eyes, and saw Meg slip a fan<br/>into her pocket.<br/>
