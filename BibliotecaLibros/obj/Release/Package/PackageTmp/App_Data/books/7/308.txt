"No, it's a new one, but I can bear it," and Beth tried to check
her tears.

"Tell me all about it, and let me cure it as I often did the
other."

"You can't, there is no cure." There Beth's voice gave way, and
clinging to her sister, she cried so despairingly that Jo was
frightened.

"Where is it? Shall I call Mother?"

"No, no, don't call her, don't tell her. I shall be better soon.
Lie down here and 'poor' my head. I'll be quiet and go to sleep,
indeed I will."

Jo obeyed, but as her hand went softly to and fro across Beth's
hot forehead and wet eyelids, her heart was very full and she
longed to speak. But young as she was, Jo had learned that hearts,
like flowers, cannot be rudely handled, but must open naturally, so
though she believed she knew the cause of Beth's new pain, she only
said, in her tenderest tone, "Does anything trouble you,
deary?"

"Yes, Jo," after a long pause.

"Wouldn't it comfort you to tell me what it is?"

"Not now, not yet."

"Then I won't ask, but remember, Bethy, that Mother and Jo are
always glad to hear and help you, if they can."
