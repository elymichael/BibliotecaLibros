&#160;<br/><br/>"How nice! But I wish she'd let us have them now.<br/>Procrastination is not agreeable," observed Amy, taking a last look<br/>at the diamonds.<br/><br/>"It is too soon yet for the young ladies to wear these things.<br/>The first one who is affianced will have the pearls, Madame has<br/>said it, and I have a fancy that the little turquoise ring will be<br/>given to you when you go, for Madame approves your good behavior<br/>and charming manners."<br/><br/>"Do you think so? Oh, I'll be a lamb, if I can only have that<br/>lovely ring! It's ever so much prettier than Kitty Bryant's. I do<br/>like Aunt March after all." And Amy tried on the blue ring with a<br/>delighted face and a firm resolve to earn it.<br/><br/>From that day she was a model of obedience, and the old lady<br/>complacently admired the success of her training. Esther fitted up<br/>the closet with a little table, placed a footstool before it, and<br/>over it a picture taken from one of the shut-up rooms. She thought<br/>it was of no great value, but, being appropriate, she borrowed it,<br/>well knowing that Madame would never know it, nor care if she did.<br/>It was, however, a very valuable copy of one of the famous pictures<br/>of the world, and Amy's beauty-loving eyes were never tired of<br/>looking up at the sweet face of the Divine Mother, while her tender<br/>thoughts of her own were busy at her heart. On the table she laid<br/>her little testament and hymnbook, kept a vase always full of the<br/>best flowers Laurie brought her, and came every day to 'sit alone'<br/>thinking good thoughts, and praying the dear God to preserve her<br/>sister. Esther had given her a rosary of black beads with a silver<br/>cross, but Amy hung it up and did not use it, feeling doubtful as<br/>to its fitness for Protestant prayers.<br/><br/>The little girl was very sincere in all this, for being left<br/>alone outside the safe home nest, she felt the need of some kind<br/>hand to hold by so sorely that she instinctively turned to the<br/>strong and tender Friend, whose fatherly love most closely<br/>surrounds His little children. She missed her mother's help to<br/>understand and rule herself, but having been taught where to look,<br/>she did her best to find the way and walk in it confidingly. But,<br/>Amy was a young pilgrim, and just now her burden seemed very heavy.<br/>She tried to forget herself, to keep cheerful, and be satisfied<br/>with doing right, though no one saw or praised her for it. In her<br/>first effort at being very, very good, she decided to make her<br/>will, as Aunt March had done, so that if she did fall ill and die,<br/>her possessions might be justly and generously divided. It cost her<br/>a pang even to think of giving up the little treasures which in her<br/>eyes were as precious as the old lady's jewels.<br/><br/>During one of her play hours she wrote out the important<br/>document as well as she could, with some help from Esther as to<br/>certain legal terms, and when the good-natured Frenchwoman had<br/>signed her name, Amy felt relieved and laid it by to show Laurie,<br/>whom she wanted as a second witness. As it was a rainy day, she<br/>went upstairs to amuse herself in one of the large chambers, and<br/>took Polly with her for company. In this room there was a wardrobe<br/>full of old-fashioned costumes with which Esther allowed her to<br/>play, and it was her favorite amusement to array herself in the<br/>faded brocades, and parade up and down before the long mirror,<br/>making stately curtsies, and sweeping her train about with a rustle<br/>which delighted her ears. So busy was she on this day that she did<br/>not hear Laurie's ring nor see his face peeping in at her as she<br/>gravely promenaded to and fro, flirting her fan and tossing her<br/>head, on which she wore a great pink turban, contrasting oddly with<br/>her blue brocade dress and yellow quilted petticoat. She was<br/>obliged to walk carefully, for she had on highheeled shoes, and, as<br/>Laurie told Jo afterward, it was a comical sight to see her mince<br/>along in her gay suit, with Polly sidling and bridling just behind<br/>her, imitating her as well as he could, and occasionally stopping<br/>to laugh or exclaim, "Ain't we fine? Get along, you fright! Hold<br/>your tongue! Kiss me, dear! Ha! Ha!"<br/><br/>Having with difficulty restrained an explosion of merriment,<br/>lest it should offend her majesty, Laurie tapped and was graciously<br/>received.<br/><br/>"Sit down and rest while I put these things away, then I want to<br/>consult you about a very serious matter," said Amy, when she had<br/>shown her splendor and driven Polly into a corner. "That bird is<br/>the trial of my life," she continued, removing the pink mountain<br/>from her head, while Laurie seated himself astride a chair.<br/><br/>"Yesterday, when Aunt was asleep and I was trying to be as still<br/>as a mouse, Polly began to squall and flap about in his cage, so I<br/>went to let him out, and found a big spider there. I poked it out,<br/>and it ran under the bookcase. Polly marched straight after it,<br/>stooped down and peeped under the bookcase, saying, in his funny<br/>way, with a cock of his eye, 'Come out and take a walk, my dear.' I<br/>couldn't help laughing, which made Poll swear, and Aunt woke up and<br/>scolded us both."<br/><br/>"Did the spider accept the old fellow's invitation?" asked<br/>Laurie, yawning.<br/>
