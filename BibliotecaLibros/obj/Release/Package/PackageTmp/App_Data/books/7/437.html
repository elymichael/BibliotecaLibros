<br/>It was a very astonishing year altogether, for things seemed to<br/>happen in an unusually rapid and delightful manner. Almost before<br/>she knew where she was, Jo found herself married and settled at<br/>Plumfield. Then a family of six or seven boys sprung up like<br/>mushrooms, and flourished surprisingly, poor boys as well as rich,<br/>for Mr. Laurence was continually finding some touching case of<br/>destitution, and begging the Bhaers to take pity on the child, and<br/>he would gladly pay a trifle for its support. In this way, the sly<br/>old gentleman got round proud Jo, and furnished her with the style<br/>of boy in which she most delighted.<br/><br/>Of course it was uphill work at first, and Jo made queer<br/>mistakes, but the wise Professor steered her safely into calmer<br/>waters, and the most rampant ragamuffin was conquered in the end.<br/>How Jo did enjoy her 'wilderness of boys', and how poor, dear Aunt<br/>March would have lamented had she been there to see the sacred<br/>precincts of prim, well-ordered Plumfield overrun with Toms, Dicks,<br/>and Harrys! There was a sort of poetic justice about it, after all,<br/>for the old lady had been the terror of the boys for miles around,<br/>and now the exiles feasted freely on forbidden plums, kicked up the<br/>gravel with profane boots unreproved, and played cricket in the big<br/>field where the irritable 'cow with a crumpled horn' used to invite<br/>rash youths to come and be tossed. It became a sort of boys'<br/>paradise, and Laurie suggested that it should be called the<br/>'Bhaer-garten', as a compliment to its master and appropriate to<br/>its inhabitants.<br/><br/>It never was a fashionable school, and the Professor did not lay<br/>up a fortune, but it was just what Jo intended it to be—'a happy,<br/>homelike place for boys, who needed teaching, care, and kindness'.<br/>Every room in the big house was soon full. Every little plot in the<br/>garden soon had its owner. A regular menagerie appeared in barn and<br/>shed, for pet animals were allowed. And three times a day, Jo<br/>smiled at her Fritz from the head of a long table lined on either<br/>side with rows of happy young faces, which all turned to her with<br/>affectionate eyes, confiding words, and grateful hearts, full of<br/>love for 'Mother Bhaer'. She had boys enough now, and did not tire<br/>of them, though they were not angels, by any means, and some of<br/>them caused both Professor and Professorin much trouble and<br/>anxiety. But her faith in the good spot which exists in the heart<br/>of the naughtiest, sauciest, most tantalizing little ragamuffin<br/>gave her patience, skill, and in time success, for no mortal boy<br/>could hold out long with Father Bhaer shining on him as<br/>benevolently as the sun, and Mother Bhaer forgiving him seventy<br/>times seven. Very precious to Jo was the friendship of the lads,<br/>their penitent sniffs and whispers after wrongdoing, their droll or<br/>touching little confidences, their pleasant enthusiasms, hopes, and<br/>plans, even their misfortunes, for they only endeared them to her<br/>all the more. There were slow boys and bashful boys, feeble boys<br/>and riotous boys, boys that lisped and boys that stuttered, one or<br/>two lame ones, and a merry little quadroon, who could not be taken<br/>in elsewhere, but who was welcome to the 'Bhaer-garten', though<br/>some people predicted that his admission would ruin the school.<br/><br/>Yes, Jo was a very happy woman there, in spite of hard work,<br/>much anxiety, and a perpetual racket. She enjoyed it heartily and<br/>found the applause of her boys more satisfying than any praise of<br/>the world, for now she told no stories except to her flock of<br/>enthusiastic believers and admirers. As the years went on, two<br/>little lads of her own came to increase her happiness—Rob, named<br/>for Grandpa, and Teddy, a happy-go-lucky baby, who seemed to have<br/>inherited his papa's sunshiny temper as well as his mother's lively<br/>spirit. How they ever grew up alive in that whirlpool of boys was a<br/>mystery to their grandma and aunts, but they flourished like<br/>dandelions in spring, and their rough nurses loved and served them<br/>well.<br/><br/>There were a great many holidays at Plumfield, and one of the<br/>most delightful was the yearly apple-picking. For then the Marches,<br/>Laurences, Brookes and Bhaers turned out in full force and made a<br/>day of it. Five years after Jo's wedding, one of these fruitful<br/>festivals occurred, a mellow October day, when the air was full of<br/>an exhilarating freshness which made the spirits rise and the blood<br/>dance healthily in the veins. The old orchard wore its holiday<br/>attire. Goldenrod and asters fringed the mossy walls. Grasshoppers<br/>skipped briskly in the sere grass, and crickets chirped like fairy<br/>pipers at a feast. Squirrels were busy with their small harvesting.<br/>Birds twittered their adieux from the alders in the lane, and every<br/>tree stood ready to send down its shower of red or yellow apples at<br/>the first shake. Everybody was there. Everybody laughed and sang,<br/>climbed up and tumbled down. Everybody declared that there never<br/>had been such a perfect day or such a jolly set to enjoy it, and<br/>everyone gave themselves up to the simple pleasures of the hour as<br/>freely as if there were no such things as care or sorrow in the<br/>world.<br/><br/>Mr. March strolled placidly about, quoting Tusser, Cowley, and<br/>Columella to Mr. Laurence, while enjoying…<br/><br/>The gentle apple's winey juice.<br/><br/>The Professor charged up and down the green aisles like a stout<br/>Teutonic knight, with a pole for a lance, leading on the boys, who<br/>made a hook and ladder company of themselves, and performed wonders<br/>in the way of ground and lofty tumbling. Laurie devoted himself to<br/>the little ones, rode his small daughter in a bushel-basket, took<br/>Daisy up among the bird's nests, and kept adventurous Rob from<br/>breaking his neck. Mrs. March and Meg sat among the apple piles<br/>like a pair of Pomonas, sorting the contributions that kept pouring<br/>in, while Amy with a beautiful motherly expression in her face<br/>sketched the various groups, and watched over one pale lad, who sat<br/>adoring her with his little crutch beside him.<br/><br/>Jo was in her element that day, and rushed about, with her gown<br/>pinned up, and her hat anywhere but on her head, and her baby<br/>tucked under her arm, ready for any lively adventure which might<br/>turn up. Little Teddy bore a charmed life, for nothing ever<br/>happened to him, and Jo never felt any anxiety when he was whisked<br/>up into a tree by one lad, galloped off on the back of another, or<br/>supplied with sour russets by his indulgent papa, who labored under<br/>the Germanic delusion that babies could digest anything, from<br/>pickled cabbage to buttons, nails, and their own small shoes. She<br/>knew that little Ted would turn up again in time, safe and rosy,<br/>dirty and serene, and she always received him back with a hearty<br/>welcome, for Jo loved her babies tenderly.<br/><br/>At four o'clock a lull took place, and baskets remained empty,<br/>while the apple pickers rested and compared rents and bruises. Then<br/>Jo and Meg, with a detachment of the bigger boys, set forth the<br/>supper on the grass, for an out-of-door tea was always the crowning<br/>joy of the day. The land literally flowed with milk and honey on<br/>such occasions, for the lads were not required to sit at table, but<br/>allowed to partake of refreshment as they liked—freedom being the<br/>sauce best beloved by the boyish soul. They availed themselves of<br/>the rare privilege to the fullest extent, for some tried the<br/>pleasing experiment of drinking milk while standing on their heads,<br/>others lent a charm to leapfrog by eating pie in the pauses of the<br/>game, cookies were sown broadcast over the field, and apple<br/>turnovers roosted in the trees like a new style of bird. The little<br/>girls had a private tea party, and Ted roved among the edibles at<br/>his own sweet will.<br/><br/>
