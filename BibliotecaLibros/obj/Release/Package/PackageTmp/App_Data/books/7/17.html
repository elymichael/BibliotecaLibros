"Don't laugh at me, Jo! I didn't mean anyone should know till<br/>the time came. I only meant to change the little bottle for a big<br/>one, and I gave all my money to get it, and I'm truly trying not to<br/>be selfish any more."<br/><br/>As she spoke, Amy showed the handsome flask which replaced the<br/>cheap one, and looked so earnest and humble in her little effort to<br/>forget herself that Meg hugged her on the spot, and Jo pronounced<br/>her 'a trump', while Beth ran to the window, and picked her finest<br/>rose to ornament the stately bottle.<br/><br/>"You see I felt ashamed of my present, after reading and talking<br/>about being good this morning, so I ran round the corner and<br/>changed it the minute I was up, and I'm so glad, for mine is the<br/>handsomest now."<br/><br/>Another bang of the street door sent the basket under the sofa,<br/>and the girls to the table, eager for breakfast.<br/><br/>"Merry Christmas, Marmee! Many of them! Thank you for our books.<br/>We read some, and mean to every day," they all cried in chorus.<br/><br/>"Merry Christmas, little daughters! I'm glad you began at once,<br/>and hope you will keep on. But I want to say one word before we sit<br/>down. Not far away from here lies a poor woman with a little<br/>newborn baby. Six children are huddled into one bed to keep from<br/>freezing, for they have no fire. There is nothing to eat over<br/>there, and the oldest boy came to tell me they were suffering<br/>hunger and cold. My girls, will you give them your breakfast as a<br/>Christmas present?"<br/><br/>They were all unusually hungry, having waited nearly an hour,<br/>and for a minute no one spoke, only a minute, for Jo exclaimed<br/>impetuously, "I'm so glad you came before we began!"<br/><br/>"May I go and help carry the things to the poor little<br/>children?" asked Beth eagerly.<br/><br/>"I shall take the cream and the muffings," added Amy, heroically<br/>giving up the article she most liked.<br/><br/>Meg was already covering the buckwheats, and piling the bread<br/>into one big plate.<br/><br/>"I thought you'd do it," said Mrs. March, smiling as if<br/>satisfied. "You shall all go and help me, and when we come back we<br/>will have bread and milk for breakfast, and make it up at<br/>dinnertime."<br/>
