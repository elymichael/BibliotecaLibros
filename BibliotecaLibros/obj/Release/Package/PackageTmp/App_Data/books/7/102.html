<br/>&#160;<br/><br/>________<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Mr. Pickwick, Sir:â€”<br/><br/>I address you upon the subject of sin the sinner I mean is a man<br/>named Winkle who makes trouble in his club by laughing and<br/>sometimes won't write his piece in this fine paper I hope you will<br/>pardon his badness and let him send a French fable because he can't<br/>write out of his head as he has so many lessons to do and no brains<br/>in future I will try to take time by the fetlock and prepare some<br/>work which will be all commy la fo that means all right I am in<br/>haste as it is nearly school time.<br/><br/>Yours respectably,<br/><br/>N. WINKLE<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>[The above is a manly and handsome aknowledgment of past<br/>misdemeanors. If our young friend studied punctuation, it would be<br/>well.]<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>
