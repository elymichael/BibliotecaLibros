"Oh my Teddy! Oh my Teddy!"

"Dear Jo, you are glad to see me, then?"

"Glad! My blessed boy, words can't express my gladness. Where's
Amy?"

"Your mother has got her down at Meg's. We stopped there by the
way, and there was no getting my wife out of their clutches."

"Your what?" cried Jo, for Laurie uttered those two words with
an unconscious pride and satisfaction which betrayed him.

"Oh, the dickens! Now I've done it," and he looked so guilty
that Jo was down on him like a flash.

"You've gone and got married!"

"Yes, please, but I never will again," and he went down upon his
knees, with a penitent clasping of hands, and a face full of
mischief, mirth, and triumph.

"Actually married?"

"Very much so, thank you."
