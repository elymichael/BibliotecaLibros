<br/>"Oh, yes, of course it's very nice and proper in them to do so.<br/>We have many most respectable and worthy young women who do the<br/>same and are employed by the nobility, because, being the daughters<br/>of gentlemen, they are both well bred and accomplished, you know,"<br/>said Miss Kate in a patronizing tone that hurt Meg's pride, and<br/>made her work seem not only more distasteful, but degrading.<br/><br/>"Did the German song suit, Miss March?" inquired Mr. Brooke,<br/>breaking an awkward pause.<br/><br/>"Oh, yes! It was very sweet, and I'm much obliged to whoever<br/>translated it for me." And Meg's downcast face brightened as she<br/>spoke.<br/><br/>"Don't you read German?" asked Miss Kate with a look of<br/>surprise.<br/><br/>"Not very well. My father, who taught me, is away, and I don't<br/>get on very fast alone, for I've no one to correct my<br/>pronunciation."<br/><br/>"Try a little now. Here is Schiller's Mary Stuart and a tutor<br/>who loves to teach." And Mr. Brooke laid his book on her lap with<br/>an inviting smile.<br/><br/>"It's so hard I'm afraid to try," said Meg, grateful, but<br/>bashful in the presence of the accomplished young lady beside<br/>her.<br/><br/>"I'll read a bit to encourage you." And Miss Kate read one of<br/>the most beautiful passages in a perfectly correct but perfectly<br/>expressionless manner.<br/><br/>Mr. Brooke made no comment as she returned the book to Meg, who<br/>said innocently, "I thought it was poetry."<br/><br/>"Some of it is. Try this passage."<br/><br/>
