<br/>"So!" he said, as I stopped and stared like a<br/>goose, "you peep at me, I peep at you, and this is not bad, but<br/>see, I am not pleasanting when I say, haf you a wish for<br/>German?"<br/><br/>"Yes, but you are too busy. I am too stupid to<br/>learn," I blundered out, as red as a peony.<br/><br/>"Prut! We will make the time, and we fail not to<br/>find the sense. At efening I shall gif a little lesson with much<br/>gladness, for look you, Mees Marsch, I haf this debt to pay." And<br/>he pointed to my work 'Yes,' they say to one another, these so kind<br/>ladies, 'he is a stupid old fellow, he will see not what we do, he<br/>will never observe that his sock heels go not in holes any more, he<br/>will think his buttons grow out new when they fall, and believe<br/>that strings make theirselves.' "Ah! But I haf an eye, and I see<br/>much. I haf a heart, and I feel thanks for this. Come, a little<br/>lesson then and now, orâ€”no more good fairy works for me and<br/>mine."<br/><br/>Of course I couldn't say anything after that, and<br/>as it really is a splendid opportunity, I made the bargain, and we<br/>began. I took four lessons, and then I stuck fast in a grammatical<br/>bog. The Professor was very patient with me, but it must have been<br/>torment to him, and now and then he'd look at me with such an<br/>expression of mild despair that it was a toss-up with me whether to<br/>laugh or cry. I tried both ways, and when it came to a sniff or<br/>utter mortification and woe, he just threw the grammar on to the<br/>floor and marched out of the room. I felt myself disgraced and<br/>deserted forever, but didn't blame him a particle, and was<br/>scrambling my papers together, meaning to rush upstairs and shake<br/>myself hard, when in he came, as brisk and beaming as if I'd<br/>covered myself in glory.<br/><br/>"Now we shall try a new way. You and I will read<br/>these pleasant little&#160;<br/>marchen<br/>&#160;together, and dig<br/>no more in that dry book, that goes in the corner for making us<br/>trouble."<br/><br/>He spoke so kindly, and opened Hans Andersons's<br/>fairy tales so invitingly before me, that I was more ashamed than<br/>ever, and went at my lesson in a neck-or-nothing style that seemed<br/>to amuse him immensely. I forgot my bashfulness, and pegged away<br/>(no other word will express it) with all my might, tumbling over<br/>long words, pronouncing according to inspiration of the minute, and<br/>doing my very best. When I finished reading my first page, and<br/>stopped for breath, he clapped his hands and cried out in his<br/>hearty way, "Das ist gut! Now we go well! My turn. I do him in<br/>German, gif me your ear." And away he went, rumbling out the words<br/>with his strong voice and a relish which was good to see as well as<br/>hear. Fortunately the story was&#160;<br/>The Constant Tin<br/>Soldier<br/>, which is droll, you know, so I could laugh, and I<br/>did, though I didn't understand half he read, for I couldn't help<br/>it, he was so earnest, I so excited, and the whole thing so<br/>comical.<br/><br/>After that we got on better, and now I read my<br/>lessons pretty well, for this way of studying suits me, and I can<br/>see that the grammar gets tucked into the tales and poetry as one<br/>gives pills in jelly. I like it very much, and he doesn't seem<br/>tired of it yet, which is very good of him, isn't it? I mean to<br/>give him something on Christmas, for I dare not offer money. Tell<br/>me something nice, Marmee.<br/><br/>I'm glad Laurie seems so happy and busy, that he<br/>has given up smoking and lets his hair grow. You see Beth manages<br/>him better than I did. I'm not jealous, dear, do your best, only<br/>don't make a saint of him. I'm afraid I couldn't like him without a<br/>spice of human naughtiness. Read him bits of my letters. I haven't<br/>time to write much, and that will do just as well. Thank Heaven<br/>Beth continues so comfortable.<br/><br/>
