<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>21<br/>Laurie Makes Mischief, and Jo Makes Peace<br/><br/><br/>Jo's face was a study next day, for the secret rather weighed<br/>upon her, and she found it hard not to look mysterious and<br/>important. Meg observed it, but did not trouble herself to make<br/>inquiries, for she had learned that the best way to manage Jo was<br/>by the law of contraries, so she felt sure of being told everything<br/>if she did not ask. She was rather surprised, therefore, when the<br/>silence remained unbroken, and Jo assumed a patronizing air, which<br/>decidedly aggravated Meg, who in turn assumed an air of dignified<br/>reserve and devoted herself to her mother. This left Jo to her own<br/>devices, for Mrs. March had taken her place as nurse, and bade her<br/>rest, exercise, and amuse herself after her long confinement. Amy<br/>being gone, Laurie was her only refuge, and much as she enjoyed his<br/>society, she rather dreaded him just then, for he was an<br/>incorrigible tease, and she feared he would coax the secret from<br/>her.<br/><br/>She was quite right, for the mischief-loving lad no sooner<br/>suspected a mystery than he set himself to find it out, and led Jo<br/>a trying life of it. He wheedled, bribed, ridiculed, threatened,<br/>and scolded; affected indifference, that he might surprise the<br/>truth from her; declared he knew, then that he didn't care; and at<br/>last, by dint of perseverance, he satisfied himself that it<br/>concerned Meg and Mr. Brooke. Feeling indignant that he was not<br/>taken into his tutor's confidence, he set his wits to work to<br/>devise some proper retaliation for the slight.<br/><br/>Meg meanwhile had apparently forgotten the matter and was<br/>absorbed in preparations for her father's return, but all of a<br/>sudden a change seemed to come over her, and, for a day or two, she<br/>was quite unlike herself. She started when spoken to, blushed when<br/>looked at, was very quiet, and sat over her sewing, with a timid,<br/>troubled look on her face. To her mother's inquiries she answered<br/>that she was quite well, and Jo's she silenced by begging to be let<br/>alone.<br/><br/>"She feels it in the air—love, I mean—and she's going very fast.<br/>She's got most of the symptoms—is twittery and cross, doesn't eat,<br/>lies awake, and mopes in corners. I caught her singing that song he<br/>gave her, and once she said 'John', as you do, and then turned as<br/>red as a poppy. Whatever shall we do?" said Jo, looking ready for<br/>any measures, however violent.<br/><br/>"Nothing but wait. Let her alone, be kind and patient, and<br/>Father's coming will settle everything," replied her mother.<br/><br/>"Here's a note to you, Meg, all sealed up. How odd! Teddy never<br/>seals mine," said Jo next day, as she distributed the contents of<br/>the little post office.<br/><br/>Mrs. March and Jo were deep in their own affairs, when a sound<br/>from Meg made them look up to see her staring at her note with a<br/>frightened face.<br/>
