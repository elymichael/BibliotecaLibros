"If he did speak, you wouldn't know what to say, but would cry
or blush, or let him have his own way, instead of giving a good,
decided no."

"I'm not so silly and weak as you think. I know just what I
should say, for I've planned it all, so I needn't be taken
unawares. There's no knowing what may happen, and I wished to be
prepared."

Jo couldn't help smiling at the important air which Meg had
unconsciously assumed and which was as becoming as the pretty color
varying in her cheeks.

"Would you mind telling me what you'd say?" asked Jo more
respectfully.

"Not at all. You are sixteen now, quite old enough to be my
confident, and my experience will be useful to you by-and-by,
perhaps, in your own affairs of this sort."

"Don't mean to have any. It's fun to watch other people
philander, but I should feel like a fool doing it myself," said Jo,
looking alarmed at the thought.

"I think not, if you liked anyone very much, and he liked you."
Meg spoke as if to herself, and glanced out at the lane where she
had often seen lovers walking together in the summer twilight.

"I thought you were going to tell your speech to that man," said
Jo, rudely shortening her sister's little reverie.

"Oh, I should merely say, quite calmly and decidedly, 'Thank
you, Mr. Brooke, you are very kind, but I agree with Father that I
am too young to enter into any engagement at present, so please say
no more, but let us be friends as we were.'"

"Hum, that's stiff and cool enough! I don't believe you'll ever
say it, and I know he won't be satisfied if you do. If he goes on
like the rejected lovers in books, you'll give in, rather than hurt
his feelings."
