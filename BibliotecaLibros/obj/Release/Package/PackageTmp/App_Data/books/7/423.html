<br/>"Miss Marsch, I haf a great favor to ask of you," began the<br/>Professor, after a moist promenade of half a block.<br/><br/>"Yes, sir?" and Jo's heart began to beat so hard she was afraid<br/>he would hear it.<br/><br/>"I am bold to say it in spite of the rain, because so short a<br/>time remains to me."<br/><br/>"Yes, sir," and Jo nearly crushed the small flowerpot with the<br/>sudden squeeze she gave it.<br/><br/>"I wish to get a little dress for my Tina, and I am too stupid<br/>to go alone. Will you kindly gif me a word of taste and help?"<br/><br/>"Yes, sir," and Jo felt as calm and cool all of a sudden as if<br/>she had stepped into a refrigerator.<br/><br/>"Perhaps also a shawl for Tina's mother, she is so poor and<br/>sick, and the husband is such a care. Yes, yes, a thick, warm shawl<br/>would be a friendly thing to take the little mother."<br/><br/>"I'll do it with pleasure, Mr. Bhaer." "I'm going very fast, and<br/>he's getting dearer every minute," added Jo to herself, then with a<br/>mental shake she entered into the business with an energy that was<br/>pleasant to behold.<br/><br/>Mr. Bhaer left it all to her, so she chose a pretty gown for<br/>Tina, and then ordered out the shawls. The clerk, being a married<br/>man, condescended to take an interest in the couple, who appeared<br/>to be shopping for their family.<br/><br/>"Your lady may prefer this. It's a superior article, a most<br/>desirable color, quite chaste and genteel," he said, shaking out a<br/>comfortable gray shawl, and throwing it over Jo's shoulders.<br/><br/>
