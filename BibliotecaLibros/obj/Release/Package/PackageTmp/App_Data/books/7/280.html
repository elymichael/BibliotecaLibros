"We read a story of yours the other day, and enjoyed it very<br/>much," observed the elder Miss Lamb, wishing to compliment the<br/>literary lady, who did not look the character just then, it must be<br/>confessed.<br/><br/>Any mention of her 'works' always had a bad effect upon Jo, who<br/>either grew rigid and looked offended, or changed the subject with<br/>a brusque remark, as now. "Sorry you could find nothing better to<br/>read. I write that rubbish because it sells, and ordinary people<br/>like it. Are you going to New York this winter?"<br/><br/>As Miss Lamb had 'enjoyed' the story, this speech was not<br/>exactly grateful or complimentary. The minute it was made Jo saw<br/>her mistake, but fearing to make the matter worse, suddenly<br/>remembered that it was for her to make the first move toward<br/>departure, and did so with an abruptness that left three people<br/>with half-finished sentences in their mouths.<br/><br/>"Amy, we must go. Good-by, dear, do come and see us. We are<br/>pining for a visit. I don't dare to ask you, Mr. Lamb, but if you<br/>should come, I don't think I shall have the heart to send you<br/>away."<br/><br/>Jo said this with such a droll imitation of May Chester's<br/>gushing style that Amy got out of the room as rapidly as possible,<br/>feeling a strong desire to laugh and cry at the same time.<br/><br/>"Didn't I do well?" asked Jo, with a satisfied air as they<br/>walked away.<br/><br/>"Nothing could have been worse," was Amy's crushing reply. "What<br/>possessed you to tell those stories about my saddle, and the hats<br/>and boots, and all the rest of it?"<br/><br/>"Why, it's funny, and amuses people. They know we are poor, so<br/>it's no use pretending that we have grooms, buy three or four hats<br/>a season, and have things as easy and fine as they do."<br/><br/>"You needn't go and tell them all our little shifts, and expose<br/>our poverty in that perfectly unnecessary way. You haven't a bit of<br/>proper pride, and never will learn when to hold your tongue and<br/>when to speak," said Amy despairingly.<br/><br/>Poor Jo looked abashed, and silently chafed the end of her nose<br/>with the stiff handkerchief, as if performing a penance for her<br/>misdemeanors.<br/><br/>"How shall I behave here?" she asked, as they approached the<br/>third mansion.<br/>
