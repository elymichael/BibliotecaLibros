<br/>"We are not strangers, we are neighbors, and you needn't think<br/>you'd be a bother. We want to know you, and I've been trying to do<br/>it this ever so long. We haven't been here a great while, you know,<br/>but we have got acquainted with all our neighbors but you."<br/><br/>"You see, Grandpa lives among his books, and doesn't mind much<br/>what happens outside. Mr. Brooke, my tutor, doesn't stay here, you<br/>know, and I have no one to go about with me, so I just stop at home<br/>and get on as I can."<br/><br/>"That's bad. You ought to make an effort and go visiting<br/>everywhere you are asked, then you'll have plenty of friends, and<br/>pleasant places to go to. Never mind being bashful. It won't last<br/>long if you keep going."<br/><br/>Laurie turned red again, but wasn't offended at being accused of<br/>bashfulness, for there was so much good will in Jo it was<br/>impossible not to take her blunt speeches as kindly as they were<br/>meant.<br/><br/>"Do you like your school?" asked the boy, changing the subject,<br/>after a little pause, during which he stared at the fire and Jo<br/>looked about her, well pleased.<br/><br/>"Don't go to school, I'm a businessmanâ€”girl, I mean. I go to<br/>wait on my great-aunt, and a dear, cross old soul she is, too,"<br/>answered Jo.<br/><br/>Laurie opened his mouth to ask another question, but remembering<br/>just in time that it wasn't manners to make too many inquiries into<br/>people's affairs, he shut it again, and looked uncomfortable.<br/><br/>Jo liked his good breeding, and didn't mind having a laugh at<br/>Aunt March, so she gave him a lively description of the fidgety old<br/>lady, her fat poodle, the parrot that talked Spanish, and the<br/>library where she reveled.<br/><br/>Laurie enjoyed that immensely, and when she told about the prim<br/>old gentleman who came once to woo Aunt March, and in the middle of<br/>a fine speech, how Poll had tweaked his wig off to his great<br/>dismay, the boy lay back and laughed till the tears ran down his<br/>cheeks, and a maid popped her head in to see what was the<br/>matter.<br/><br/>"Oh! That does me no end of good. Tell on, please," he said,<br/>taking his face out of the sofa cushion, red and shining with<br/>merriment.<br/><br/>
