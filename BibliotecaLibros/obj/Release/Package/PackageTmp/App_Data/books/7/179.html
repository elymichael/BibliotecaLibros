<br/>COLONEL TEDDY<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Dear Madam:<br/><br/>The little girls are all well. Beth and my boy<br/>report daily. Hannah is a model servant, and guards pretty Meg like<br/>a dragon. Glad the fine weather holds. Pray make Brooke useful, and<br/>draw on me for funds if expenses exceed your estimate. Don't let<br/>your husband want anything. Thank God he is mending.<br/><br/>Your sincere friend and servant, JAMES<br/>LAURENCE<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
