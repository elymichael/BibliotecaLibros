<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>12<br/>Camp Laurence<br/><br/><br/>Beth was postmistress, for, being most at home, she could attend<br/>to it regularly, and dearly liked the daily task of unlocking the<br/>little door and distributing the mail. One July day she came in<br/>with her hands full, and went about the house leaving letters and<br/>parcels like the penny post.<br/><br/>"Here's your posy, Mother! Laurie never forgets that," she said,<br/>putting the fresh nosegay in the vase that stood in 'Marmee's<br/>corner', and was kept supplied by the affectionate boy.<br/><br/>"Miss Meg March, one letter and a glove," continued Beth,<br/>delivering the articles to her sister, who sat near her mother,<br/>stitching wristbands.<br/><br/>"Why, I left a pair over there, and here is only one," said Meg,<br/>looking at the gray cotton glove. "Didn't you drop the other in the<br/>garden?"<br/><br/>"No, I'm sure I didn't, for there was only one in the<br/>office."<br/><br/>"I hate to have odd gloves! Never mind, the other may be found.<br/>My letter is only a translation of the German song I wanted. I<br/>think Mr. Brooke did it, for this isn't Laurie's writing."<br/><br/>Mrs. March glanced at Meg, who was looking very pretty in her<br/>gingham morning gown, with the little curls blowing about her<br/>forehead, and very womanly, as she sat sewing at her little<br/>worktable, full of tidy white rolls, so unconscious of the thought<br/>in her mother's mind as she sewed and sang, while her fingers flew<br/>and her thoughts were busied with girlish fancies as innocent and<br/>fresh as the pansies in her belt, that Mrs. March smiled and was<br/>satisfied.<br/>
