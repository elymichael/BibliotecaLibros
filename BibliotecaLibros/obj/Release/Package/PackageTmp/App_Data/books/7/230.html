"No, I won't. I shall tell him I've made up my mind, and shall<br/>walk out of the room with dignity."<br/><br/>Meg rose as she spoke, and was just going to rehearse the<br/>dignified exit, when a step in the hall made her fly into her seat<br/>and begin to sew as fast as if her life depended on finishing that<br/>particular seam in a given time. Jo smothered a laugh at the sudden<br/>change, and when someone gave a modest tap, opened the door with a<br/>grim aspect which was anything but hospitable.<br/><br/>"Good afternoon. I came to get my umbrella, that is, to see how<br/>your father finds himself today," said Mr. Brooke, getting a trifle<br/>confused as his eyes went from one telltale face to the other.<br/><br/>"It's very well, he's in the rack. I'll get him, and tell it you<br/>are here." And having jumbled her father and the umbrella well<br/>together in her reply, Jo slipped out of the room to give Meg a<br/>chance to make her speech and air her dignity. But the instant she<br/>vanished, Meg began to sidle toward the door, murmuring…<br/><br/>"Mother will like to see you. Pray sit down, I'll call her."<br/><br/>"Don't go. Are you afraid of me, Margaret?" and Mr. Brooke<br/>looked so hurt that Meg thought she must have done something very<br/>rude. She blushed up to the little curls on her forehead, for he<br/>had never called her Margaret before, and she was surprised to find<br/>how natural and sweet it seemed to hear him say it. Anxious to<br/>appear friendly and at her ease, she put out her hand with a<br/>confiding gesture, and said gratefully…<br/><br/>"How can I be afraid when you have been so kind to Father? I<br/>only wish I could thank you for it."<br/><br/>"Shall I tell you how?" asked Mr. Brooke, holding the small hand<br/>fast in both his own, and looking down at Meg with so much love in<br/>the brown eyes that her heart began to flutter, and she both longed<br/>to run away and to stop and listen.<br/><br/>"Oh no, please don't, I'd rather not," she said, trying to<br/>withdraw her hand, and looking frightened in spite of her<br/>denial.<br/><br/>"I won't trouble you. I only want to know if you care for me a<br/>little, Meg. I love you so much, dear," added Mr. Brooke<br/>tenderly.<br/><br/>This was the moment for the calm, proper speech, but Meg didn't<br/>make it. She forgot every word of it, hung her head, and answered,<br/>"I don't know," so softly that John had to stoop down to catch the<br/>foolish little reply.<br/>
