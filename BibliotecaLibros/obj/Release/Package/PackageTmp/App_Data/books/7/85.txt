"Daisy, dear, I've sent an invitation to your friend, Mr.
Laurence, for Thursday. We should like to know him, and it's only a
proper compliment to you."

Meg colored, but a mischievous fancy to tease the girls made her
reply demurely, "You are very kind, but I'm afraid he won't
come."

"Why not, Cherie?" asked Miss Belle.

"He's too old."

"My child, what do you mean? What is his age, I beg to know!"
cried Miss Clara.

"Nearly seventy, I believe," answered Meg, counting stitches to
hide the merriment in her eyes.

"You sly creature! Of course we meant the young man," exclaimed
Miss Belle, laughing.

"There isn't any, Laurie is only a little boy." And Meg laughed
also at the queer look which the sisters exchanged as she thus
described her supposed lover.

"About your age," Nan said.

"Nearer my sister Jo's; I am seventeen in August," returned Meg,
tossing her head.

"It's very nice of him to send you flowers, isn't it?" said
Annie, looking wise about nothing.
