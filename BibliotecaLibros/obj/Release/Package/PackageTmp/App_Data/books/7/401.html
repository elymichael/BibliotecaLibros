<br/>"What baseness! Well, if she abuses you, come to me, and I'll<br/>defend you."<br/><br/>"I look as if I needed it, don't I?" said Laurie, getting up and<br/>striking an attitude which suddenly changed from the imposing to<br/>the rapturous, as Amy's voice was heard calling, "Where is she?<br/>Where's my dear old Jo?"<br/><br/>In trooped the whole family, and everyone was hugged and kissed<br/>all over again, and after several vain attempts, the three<br/>wanderers were set down to be looked at and exulted over. Mr.<br/>Laurence, hale and hearty as ever, was quite as much improved as<br/>the others by his foreign tour, for the crustiness seemed to be<br/>nearly gone, and the old-fashioned courtliness had received a<br/>polish which made it kindlier than ever. It was good to see him<br/>beam at 'my children', as he called the young pair. It was better<br/>still to see Amy pay him the daughterly duty and affection which<br/>completely won his old heart, and best of all, to watch Laurie<br/>revolve about the two, as if never tired of enjoying the pretty<br/>picture they made.<br/><br/>The minute she put her eyes upon Amy, Meg became conscious that<br/>her own dress hadn't a Parisian air, that young Mrs. Moffat would<br/>be entirely eclipsed by young Mrs. Laurence, and that 'her<br/>ladyship' was altogether a most elegant and graceful woman. Jo<br/>thought, as she watched the pair, "How well they look together! I<br/>was right, and Laurie has found the beautiful, accomplished girl<br/>who will become his home better than clumsy old Jo, and be a pride,<br/>not a torment to him." Mrs. March and her husband smiled and nodded<br/>at each other with happy faces, for they saw that their youngest<br/>had done well, not only in worldly things, but the better wealth of<br/>love, confidence, and happiness.<br/><br/>For Amy's face was full of the soft brightness which betokens a<br/>peaceful heart, her voice had a new tenderness in it, and the cool,<br/>prim carriage was changed to a gentle dignity, both womanly and<br/>winning. No little affectations marred it, and the cordial<br/>sweetness of her manner was more charming than the new beauty or<br/>the old grace, for it stamped her at once with the unmistakable<br/>sign of the true gentlewoman she had hoped to become.<br/><br/>"Love has done much for our little girl," said her mother<br/>softly.<br/><br/>"She has had a good example before her all her life, my dear,"<br/>Mr. March whispered back, with a loving look at the worn face and<br/>gray head beside him.<br/><br/>Daisy found it impossible to keep her eyes off her 'pitty<br/>aunty', but attached herself like a lap dog to the wonderful<br/>chatelaine full of delightful charms. Demi paused to consider the<br/>new relationship before he compromised himself by the rash<br/>acceptance of a bribe, which took the tempting form of a family of<br/>wooden bears from Berne. A flank movement produced an unconditional<br/>surrender, however, for Laurie knew where to have him.<br/><br/>"Young man, when I first had the honor of making your<br/>acquaintance you hit me in the face. Now I demand the satisfaction<br/>of a gentleman," and with that the tall uncle proceeded to toss and<br/>tousle the small nephew in a way that damaged his philosophical<br/>dignity as much as it delighted his boyish soul.<br/><br/>"Blest if she ain't in silk from head to foot; ain't it a<br/>relishin' sight to see her settin' there as fine as a fiddle, and<br/>hear folks calling little Amy 'Mis. Laurence!'" muttered old<br/>Hannah, who could not resist frequent "peeks" through the slide as<br/>she set the table in a most decidedly promiscuous manner.<br/><br/>
