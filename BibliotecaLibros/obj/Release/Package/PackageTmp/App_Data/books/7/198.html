<br/>"Yes, out it came, and away ran Polly, frightened to death, and<br/>scrambled up on Aunt's chair, calling out, 'Catch her! Catch her!<br/>Catch her!' as I chased the spider."<br/><br/>"That's a lie! Oh, lor!" cried the parrot, pecking at Laurie's<br/>toes.<br/><br/>"I'd wring your neck if you were mine, you old torment," cried<br/>Laurie, shaking his fist at the bird, who put his head on one side<br/>and gravely croaked, "Allyluyer! bless your buttons, dear!"<br/><br/>"Now I'm ready," said Amy, shutting the wardrobe and taking a<br/>piece of paper out of her pocket. "I want you to read that, please,<br/>and tell me if it is legal and right. I felt I ought to do it, for<br/>life is uncertain and I don't want any ill feeling over my<br/>tomb."<br/><br/>Laurie bit his lips, and turning a little from the pensive<br/>speaker, read the following document, with praiseworthy gravity,<br/>considering the spelling:<br/><br/><br/>MY LAST WILL AND TESTIMENT<br/><br/>I, Amy Curtis March, being in my sane mind, go<br/>give and bequeethe all my earthly property—viz. to wit:—namely<br/><br/>To my father, my best pictures, sketches, maps,<br/>and works of art, including frames. Also my $100, to do what he<br/>likes with.<br/><br/>To my mother, all my clothes, except the blue<br/>apron with pockets—also my likeness, and my medal, with much<br/>love.<br/><br/>To my dear sister Margaret, I give my turkquoise<br/>ring (if I get it), also my green box with the doves on it, also my<br/>piece of real lace for her neck, and my sketch of her as a memorial<br/>of her 'little girl'.<br/>
