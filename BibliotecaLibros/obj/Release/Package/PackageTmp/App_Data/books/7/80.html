I wouldn't forgive her, and<br/>today, if it hadn't been for Laurie, it might have been too late!<br/>How could I be so wicked?" said Jo, half aloud, as she leaned over<br/>her sister softly stroking the wet hair scattered on the<br/>pillow.<br/><br/>As if she heard, Amy opened her eyes, and held out her arms,<br/>with a smile that went straight to Jo's heart. Neither said a word,<br/>but they hugged one another close, in spite of the blankets, and<br/>everything was forgiven and forgotten in one hearty kiss.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
