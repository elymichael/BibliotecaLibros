"Does this suit you, Mr. Bhaer?" she asked, turning her back to<br/>him, and feeling deeply grateful for the chance of hiding her<br/>face.<br/><br/>"Excellently well, we will haf it," answered the Professor,<br/>smiling to himself as he paid for it, while Jo continued to rummage<br/>the counters like a confirmed bargain-hunter.<br/><br/>"Now shall we go home?" he asked, as if the words were very<br/>pleasant to him.<br/><br/>"Yes, it's late, and I'm&#160;<br/>so<br/>&#160;tired." Jo's<br/>voice was more pathetic than she knew. For now the sun seemed to<br/>have gone in as suddenly as it came out, and the world grew muddy<br/>and miserable again, and for the first time she discovered that her<br/>feet were cold, her head ached, and that her heart was colder than<br/>the former, fuller of pain than the latter. Mr. Bhaer was going<br/>away, he only cared for her as a friend, it was all a mistake, and<br/>the sooner it was over the better. With this idea in her head, she<br/>hailed an approaching omnibus with such a hasty gesture that the<br/>daisies flew out of the pot and were badly damaged.<br/><br/>"This is not our omniboos," said the Professor, waving the<br/>loaded vehicle away, and stopping to pick up the poor little<br/>flowers.<br/><br/>"I beg your pardon. I didn't see the name distinctly. Never<br/>mind, I can walk. I'm used to plodding in the mud," returned Jo,<br/>winking hard, because she would have died rather than openly wipe<br/>her eyes.<br/><br/>Mr. Bhaer saw the drops on her cheeks, though she turned her<br/>head away. The sight seemed to touch him very much, for suddenly<br/>stooping down, he asked in a tone that meant a great deal, "Heart's<br/>dearest, why do you cry?"<br/><br/>Now, if Jo had not been new to this sort of thing she would have<br/>said she wasn't crying, had a cold in her head, or told any other<br/>feminine fib proper to the occasion. Instead of which, that<br/>undignified creature answered, with an irrepressible sob, "Because<br/>you are going away."<br/><br/>"Ach, mein Gott, that is so good!" cried Mr. Bhaer, managing to<br/>clasp his hands in spite of the umbrella and the bundles, "Jo, I<br/>haf nothing but much love to gif you. I came to see if you could<br/>care for it, and I waited to be sure that I was something more than<br/>a friend. Am I? Can you make a little place in your heart for old<br/>Fritz?" he added, all in one breath.<br/><br/>"Oh, yes!" said Jo, and he was quite satisfied, for she folded<br/>both hands over his arm, and looked up at him with an expression<br/>that plainly showed how happy she would be to walk through life<br/>beside him, even though she had no better shelter than the old<br/>umbrella, if he carried it.<br/>
