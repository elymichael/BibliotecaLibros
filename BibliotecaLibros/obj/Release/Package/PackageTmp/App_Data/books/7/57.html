"Dear me, how romantic!" exclaimed Meg.<br/><br/>"How silly!" said Jo. "Let him be a musician if he wants to, and<br/>not plague his life out sending him to college, when he hates to<br/>go."<br/><br/>"That's why he has such handsome black eyes and pretty manners,<br/>I suppose. Italians are always nice," said Meg, who was a little<br/>sentimental.<br/><br/>"What do you know about his eyes and his manners? You never<br/>spoke to him, hardly," cried Jo, who was not sentimental.<br/><br/>"I saw him at the party, and what you tell shows that he knows<br/>how to behave. That was a nice little speech about the medicine<br/>Mother sent him."<br/><br/>"He meant the blanc mange, I suppose."<br/><br/>"How stupid you are, child! He meant you, of course."<br/><br/>"Did he?" And Jo opened her eyes as if it had never occurred to<br/>her before.<br/><br/>"I never saw such a girl! You don't know a compliment when you<br/>get it," said Meg, with the air of a young lady who knew all about<br/>the matter.<br/><br/>"I think they are great nonsense, and I'll thank you not to be<br/>silly and spoil my fun. Laurie's a nice boy and I like him, and I<br/>won't have any sentimental stuff about compliments and such<br/>rubbish. We'll all be good to him because he hasn't got any mother,<br/>and he may come over and see us, mayn't he, Marmee?"<br/><br/>"Yes, Jo, your little friend is very welcome, and I hope Meg<br/>will remember that children should be children as long as they<br/>can."<br/>
