"The first of June! The Kings are off to the seashore tomorrow,
and I'm free. Three months' vacation—how I shall enjoy it!"
exclaimed Meg, coming home one warm day to find Jo laid upon the
sofa in an unusual state of exhaustion, while Beth took off her
dusty boots, and Amy made lemonade for the refreshment of the whole
party.

"Aunt March went today, for which, oh, be joyful!" said Jo. "I
was mortally afraid she'd ask me to go with her. If she had, I
should have felt as if I ought to do it, but Plumfield is about as
gay as a churchyard, you know, and I'd rather be excused. We had a
flurry getting the old lady off, and I had a fright every time she
spoke to me, for I was in such a hurry to be through that I was
uncommonly helpful and sweet, and feared she'd find it impossible
to part from me. I quaked till she was fairly in the carriage, and
had a final fright, for as it drove of, she popped out her head,
saying, 'Josyphine, won't you—?' I didn't hear any more, for I
basely turned and fled. I did actually run, and whisked round the
corner where I felt safe."

"Poor old Jo! She came in looking as if bears were after her,"
said Beth, as she cuddled her sister's feet with a motherly
air.

"Aunt March is a regular samphire, is she not?" observed Amy,
tasting her mixture critically.

"She means vampire, not seaweed, but it doesn't matter. It's too
warm to be particular about one's parts of speech," murmured
Jo.

"What shall you do all your vacation?" asked Amy, changing the
subject with tact.

"I shall lie abed late, and do nothing," replied Meg, from the
depths of the rocking chair. "I've been routed up early all winter
and had to spend my days working for other people, so now I'm going
to rest and revel to my heart's content."
