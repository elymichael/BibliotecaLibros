"Anywhere. I don't care what becomes of me," and Laurie got up
with a reckless laugh that grated on his grandfather's ear.

"Take it like a man, and don't do anything rash, for God's sake.
Why not go abroad, as you planned, and forget it?"

"I can't."

"But you've been wild to go, and I promised you should when you
got through college."

"Ah, but I didn't mean to go alone!" and Laurie walked fast
through the room with an expression which it was well his
grandfather did not see.

"I don't ask you to go alone. There's someone ready and glad to
go with you, anywhere in the world."

"Who, Sir?" stopping to listen.

"Myself."

Laurie came back as quickly as he went, and put out his hand,
saying huskily, "I'm a selfish brute, but—you
know—Grandfather—"

"Lord help me, yes, I do know, for I've been through it all
before, once in my own young days, and then with your father. Now,
my dear boy, just sit quietly down and hear my plan. It's all
settled, and can be carried out at once," said Mr. Laurence,
keeping hold of the young man, as if fearful that he would break
away as his father had done before him.
