<br/>Next week we are off to Germany and Switzerland,<br/>and as we shall travel fast, I shall only be able to give you hasty<br/>letters. I keep my diary, and try to 'remember correctly and<br/>describe clearly all that I see and admire', as Father advised. It<br/>is good practice for me, and with my sketchbook will give you a<br/>better idea of my tour than these scribbles.<br/><br/>Adieu, I embrace you tenderly.&#160;<br/>"Votre<br/>Amie."<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>HEIDELBERG<br/><br/>My dear Mamma,<br/><br/>Having a quiet hour before we leave for Berne,<br/>I'll try to tell you what has happened, for some of it is very<br/>important, as you will see.<br/><br/>The sail up the Rhine was perfect, and I just sat<br/>and enjoyed it with all my might. Get Father's old guidebooks and<br/>read about it. I haven't words beautiful enough to describe it. At<br/>Coblentz we had a lovely time, for some students from Bonn, with<br/>whom Fred got acquainted on the boat, gave us a serenade. It was a<br/>moonlight night, and about one o'clock Flo and I were waked by the<br/>most delicious music under our windows. We flew up, and hid behind<br/>the curtains, but sly peeps showed us Fred and the students singing<br/>away down below. It was the most romantic thing I ever saw—the<br/>river, the bridge of boats, the great fortress opposite, moonlight<br/>everywhere, and music fit to melt a heart of stone.<br/><br/>When they were done we threw down some flowers,<br/>and saw them scramble for them, kiss their hands to the invisible<br/>ladies, and go laughing away, to smoke and drink beer, I suppose.<br/>Next morning Fred showed me one of the crumpled flowers in his vest<br/>pocket, and looked very sentimental. I laughed at him, and said I<br/>didn't throw it, but Flo, which seemed to disgust him, for he<br/>tossed it out of the window, and turned sensible again. I'm afraid<br/>I'm going to have trouble with that boy, it begins to look like<br/>it.<br/><br/>The baths at Nassau were very gay, so was<br/>Baden-Baden, where Fred lost some money, and I scolded him. He<br/>needs someone to look after him when Frank is not with him. Kate<br/>said once she hoped he'd marry soon, and I quite agree with her<br/>that it would be well for him. Frankfurt was delightful. I saw<br/>Goethe's house, Schiller's statue, and Dannecker's famous<br/>'Ariadne.' It was very lovely, but I should have enjoyed it more if<br/>I had known the story better. I didn't like to ask, as everyone<br/>knew it or pretended they did. I wish Jo would tell me all about<br/>it. I ought to have read more, for I find I don't know anything,<br/>and it mortifies me.<br/><br/>Now comes the serious part, for it happened here,<br/>and Fred has just gone. He has been so kind and jolly that we all<br/>got quite fond of him. I never thought of anything but a traveling<br/>friendship till the serenade night. Since then I've begun to feel<br/>that the moonlight walks, balcony talks, and daily adventures were<br/>something more to him than fun. I haven't flirted, Mother, truly,<br/>but remembered what you said to me, and have done my very best. I<br/>can't help it if people like me. I don't try to make them, and it<br/>worries me if I don't care for them, though Jo says I haven't got<br/>any heart. Now I know Mother will shake her head, and the girls<br/>say, "Oh, the mercenary little wretch!", but I've made up my mind,<br/>and if Fred asks me, I shall accept him, though I'm not madly in<br/>love. I like him, and we get on comfortably together. He is<br/>handsome, young, clever enough, and very rich—ever so much richer<br/>than the Laurences. I don't think his family would object, and I<br/>should be very happy, for they are all kind, well-bred, generous<br/>people, and they like me. Fred, as the eldest twin, will have the<br/>estate, I suppose, and such a splendid one it is! A city house in a<br/>fashionable street, not so showy as our big houses, but twice as<br/>comfortable and full of solid luxury, such as English people<br/>believe in. I like it, for it's genuine. I've seen the plate, the<br/>family jewels, the old servants, and pictures of the country place,<br/>with its park, great house, lovely grounds, and fine horses. Oh, it<br/>would be all I should ask! And I'd rather have it than any title<br/>such as girls snap up so readily, and find nothing behind. I may be<br/>mercenary, but I hate poverty, and don't mean to bear it a minute<br/>longer than I can help. One of us&#160;<br/>
