"Could you spare me some of your cake? I really need some, I<br/>have so much company, and I can't make such delicious stuff as<br/>yours," asked Meg soberly.<br/><br/>"Take it all. I'm the only one here who likes sweet things, and<br/>it will mold before I can dispose of it," answered Amy, thinking<br/>with a sigh of the generous store she had laid in for such an end<br/>as this.<br/><br/>"It's a pity Laurie isn't here to help us," began Jo, as they<br/>sat down to ice cream and salad for the second time in two<br/>days.<br/><br/>A warning look from her mother checked any further remarks, and<br/>the whole family ate in heroic silence, till Mr. March mildly<br/>observed, "salad was one of the favorite dishes of the ancients,<br/>and Evelynâ€¦ " Here a general explosion of laughter cut short the<br/>'history of salads', to the great surprise of the learned<br/>gentleman.<br/><br/>"Bundle everything into a basket and send it to the Hummels.<br/>Germans like messes. I'm sick of the sight of this, and there's no<br/>reason you should all die of a surfeit because I've been a fool,"<br/>cried Amy, wiping her eyes.<br/><br/>"I thought I should have died when I saw you two girls rattling<br/>about in the what-you-call-it, like two little kernels in a very<br/>big nutshell, and Mother waiting in state to receive the throng,"<br/>sighed Jo, quite spent with laughter.<br/><br/>"I'm very sorry you were disappointed, dear, but we all did our<br/>best to satisfy you," said Mrs. March, in a tone full of motherly<br/>regret.<br/><br/>"I am satisfied. I've done what I undertook, and it's not my<br/>fault that it failed. I comfort myself with that," said Amy with a<br/>little quiver in her voice. "I thank you all very much for helping<br/>me, and I'll thank you still more if you won't allude to it for a<br/>month, at least."<br/><br/>No one did for several months, but the word 'fete' always<br/>produced a general smile, and Laurie's birthday gift to Amy was a<br/>tiny coral lobster in the shape of a charm for her watch guard.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
