While Laurie listlessly watched the procession of priests under
their canopies, white-veiled nuns bearing lighted tapers, and some
brotherhood in blue chanting as they walked, Amy watched him, and
felt a new sort of shyness steal over her, for he was changed, and
she could not find the merry-faced boy she left in the
moody-looking man beside her. He was handsomer than ever and
greatly improved, she thought, but now that the flush of pleasure
at meeting her was over, he looked tired and spiritlessâ€”not sick,
nor exactly unhappy, but older and graver than a year or two of
prosperous life should have made him. She couldn't understand it
and did not venture to ask questions, so she shook her head and
touched up her ponies, as the procession wound away across the
arches of the Paglioni bridge and vanished in the church.

"Que pensez-vous?" she said, airing her French, which had
improved in quantity, if not in quality, since she came abroad.

"That mademoiselle has made good use of her time, and the result
is charming," replied Laurie, bowing with his hand on his heart and
an admiring look.

She blushed with pleasure, but somehow the compliment did not
satisfy her like the blunt praises he used to give her at home,
when he promenaded round her on festival occasions, and told her
she was 'altogether jolly', with a hearty smile and an approving
pat on the head. She didn't like the new tone, for though not
blase, it sounded indifferent in spite of the look.

"If that's the way he's going to grow up, I wish he'd stay a
boy," she thought, with a curious sense of disappointment and
discomfort, trying meantime to seem quite easy and gay.

At Avigdor's she found the precious home letters and, giving the
reins to Laurie, read them luxuriously as they wound up the shady
road between green hedges, where tea roses bloomed as freshly as in
June.

"Beth is very poorly, Mother says. I often think I ought to go
home, but they all say 'stay'. So I do, for I shall never have
another chance like this," said Amy, looking sober over one
page.

"I think you are right, there. You could do nothing at home, and
it is a great comfort to them to know that you are well and happy,
and enjoying so much, my dear."

He drew a little nearer, and looked more like his old self as he
said that, and the fear that sometimes weighed on Amy's heart was
lightened, for the look, the act, the brotherly 'my dear', seemed
to assure her that if any trouble did come, she would not be alone
in a strange land. Presently she laughed and showed him a small
sketch of Jo in her scribbling suit, with the bow rampantly erect
upon her cap, and issuing from her mouth the words, 'Genius
burns!'.

Laurie smiled, took it, put it in his vest pocket 'to keep it
from blowing away', and listened with interest to the lively letter
Amy read him.

"This will be a regularly merry Christmas to me, with presents
in the morning, you and letters in the afternoon, and a party at
night," said Amy, as they alighted among the ruins of the old fort,
and a flock of splendid peacocks came trooping about them, tamely
waiting to be fed. While Amy stood laughing on the bank above him
as she scattered crumbs to the brilliant birds, Laurie looked at
her as she had looked at him, with a natural curiosity to see what
changes time and absence had wrought. He found nothing to perplex
or disappoint, much to admire and approve, for overlooking a few
little affectations of speech and manner, she was as sprightly and
graceful as ever, with the addition of that indescribable something
in dress and bearing which we call elegance. Always mature for her
age, she had gained a certain aplomb in both carriage and
conversation, which made her seem more of a woman of the world than
she was, but her old petulance now and then showed itself, her
strong will still held its own, and her native frankness was
unspoiled by foreign polish.
