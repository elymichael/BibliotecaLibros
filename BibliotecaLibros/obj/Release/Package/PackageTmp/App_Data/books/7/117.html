<br/>"I say, isn't bread 'riz' enough when it runs over the<br/>pans?"<br/><br/>Sallie began to laugh, but Meg nodded and lifted her eyebrows as<br/>high as they would go, which caused the apparition to vanish and<br/>put the sour bread into the oven without further delay. Mrs. March<br/>went out, after peeping here and there to see how matters went,<br/>also saying a word of comfort to Beth, who sat making a winding<br/>sheet, while the dear departed lay in state in the domino box. A<br/>strange sense of helplessness fell upon the girls as the gray<br/>bonnet vanished round the corner, and despair seized them when a<br/>few minutes later Miss Crocker appeared, and said she'd come to<br/>dinner. Now this lady was a thin, yellow spinster, with a sharp<br/>nose and inquisitive eyes, who saw everything and gossiped about<br/>all she saw. They disliked her, but had been taught to be kind to<br/>her, simply because she was old and poor and had few friends. So<br/>Meg gave her the easy chair and tried to entertain her, while she<br/>asked questions, critsized everything, and told stories of the<br/>people whom she knew.<br/><br/>Language cannot describe the anxieties, experiences, and<br/>exertions which Jo underwent that morning, and the dinner she<br/>served up became a standing joke. Fearing to ask any more advice,<br/>she did her best alone, and discovered that something more than<br/>energy and good will is necessary to make a cook. She boiled the<br/>asparagus for an hour and was grieved to find the heads cooked off<br/>and the stalks harder than ever. The bread burned black; for the<br/>salad dressing so aggravated her that she could not make it fit to<br/>eat. The lobster was a scarlet mystery to her, but she hammered and<br/>poked till it was unshelled and its meager proportions concealed in<br/>a grove of lettuce leaves. The potatoes had to be hurried, not to<br/>keep the asparagus waiting, and were not done at the last. The<br/>blanc mange was lumpy, and the strawberries not as ripe as they<br/>looked, having been skilfully 'deaconed'.<br/><br/>"Well, they can eat beef and bread and butter, if they are<br/>hungry, only it's mortifying to have to spend your whole morning<br/>for nothing," thought Jo, as she rang the bell half an hour later<br/>than usual, and stood, hot, tired, and dispirited, surveying the<br/>feast spread before Laurie, accustomed to all sorts of elegance,<br/>and Miss Crocker, whose tattling tongue would report them far and<br/>wide.<br/><br/>Poor Jo would gladly have gone under the table, as one thing<br/>after another was tasted and left, while Amy giggled, Meg looked<br/>distressed, Miss Crocker pursed her lips, and Laurie talked and<br/>laughed with all his might to give a cheerful tone to the festive<br/>scene. Jo's one strong point was the fruit, for she had sugared it<br/>well, and had a pitcher of rich cream to eat with it. Her hot<br/>cheeks cooled a trifle, and she drew a long breath as the pretty<br/>glass plates went round, and everyone looked graciously at the<br/>little rosy islands floating in a sea of cream. Miss Crocker tasted<br/>first, made a wry face, and drank some water hastily. Jo, who<br/>refused, thinking there might not be enough, for they dwindled<br/>sadly after the picking over, glanced at Laurie, but he was eating<br/>away manfully, though there was a slight pucker about his mouth and<br/>he kept his eye fixed on his plate. Amy, who was fond of delicate<br/>fare, took a heaping spoonful, choked, hid her face in her napkin,<br/>and left the table precipitately.<br/><br/>"Oh, what is it?" exclaimed Jo, trembling.<br/><br/>"Salt instead of sugar, and the cream is sour," replied Meg with<br/>a tragic gesture.<br/><br/>Jo uttered a groan and fell back in her chair, remembering that<br/>she had given a last hasty powdering to the berries out of one of<br/>the two boxes on the kitchen table, and had neglected to put the<br/>milk in the refrigerator. She turned scarlet and was on the verge<br/>of crying, when she met Laurie's eyes, which would look merry in<br/>spite of his heroic efforts. The comical side of the affair<br/>suddenly struck her, and she laughed till the tears ran down her<br/>cheeks. So did everyone else, even 'Croaker' as the girls called<br/>the old lady, and the unfortunate dinner ended gaily, with bread<br/>and butter, olives and fun.<br/><br/>"I haven't strength of mind enough to clear up now, so we will<br/>sober ourselves with a funeral," said Jo, as they rose, and Miss<br/>Crocker made ready to go, being eager to tell the new story at<br/>another friend's dinner table.<br/><br/>They did sober themselves for Beth's sake. Laurie dug a grave<br/>under the ferns in the grove, little Pip was laid in, with many<br/>tears by his tender-hearted mistress, and covered with moss, while<br/>a wreath of violets and chickweed was hung on the stone which bore<br/>his epitaph, composed by Jo while she struggled with the<br/>dinner.<br/><br/>
