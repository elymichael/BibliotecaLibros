"I observed that Amy took drumsticks at dinner, ran errands for<br/>her mother all the afternoon, gave Meg her place tonight, and has<br/>waited on every one with patience and good humor. I also observe<br/>that she does not fret much nor look in the glass, and has not even<br/>mentioned a very pretty ring which she wears, so I conclude that<br/>she has learned to think of other people more and of herself less,<br/>and has decided to try and mold her character as carefully as she<br/>molds her little clay figures. I am glad of this, for though I<br/>should be very proud of a graceful statue made by her, I shall be<br/>infinitely prouder of a lovable daughter with a talent for making<br/>life beautiful to herself and others."<br/><br/>"What are you thinking of, Beth?" asked Jo, when Amy had thanked<br/>her father and told about her ring.<br/><br/>"I read in&#160;<br/>Pilgrim's Progress<br/>&#160;today how,<br/>after many troubles, Christian and Hopeful came to a pleasant green<br/>meadow where lilies bloomed all year round, and there they rested<br/>happily, as we do now, before they went on to their journey's end,"<br/>answered Beth, adding, as she slipped out of her father's arms and<br/>went to the instrument, "It's singing time now, and I want to be in<br/>my old place. I'll try to sing the song of the shepherd boy which<br/>the Pilgrims heard. I made the music for Father, because he likes<br/>the verses."<br/><br/>So, sitting at the dear little piano, Beth softly touched the<br/>keys, and in the sweet voice they had never thought to hear again,<br/>sang to her own accompaniment the quaint hymn, which was a<br/>singularly fitting song for her.<br/><br/><br/>He that is down need fear no fall,<br/>He that is low no pride.<br/>He that is humble ever shall<br/>Have God to be his guide.<br/><br/>I am content with what I have,<br/>Little be it, or much.<br/>And, Lord! Contentment still I crave,<br/>Because Thou savest such.<br/><br/>
