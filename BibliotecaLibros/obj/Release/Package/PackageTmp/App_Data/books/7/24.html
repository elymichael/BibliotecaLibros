<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>3<br/>The Laurence Boy<br/><br/><br/>"Jo! Jo! Where are you?" cried Meg at the foot of the garret<br/>stairs.<br/><br/>"Here!" answered a husky voice from above, and, running up, Meg<br/>found her sister eating apples and crying over the Heir of<br/>Redclyffe, wrapped up in a comforter on an old three-legged sofa by<br/>the sunny window. This was Jo's favorite refuge, and here she loved<br/>to retire with half a dozen russets and a nice book, to enjoy the<br/>quiet and the society of a pet rat who lived near by and didn't<br/>mind her a particle. As Meg appeared, Scrabble whisked into his<br/>hole. Jo shook the tears off her cheeks and waited to hear the<br/>news.<br/><br/>"Such fun! Only see! A regular note of invitation from Mrs.<br/>Gardiner for tomorrow night!" cried Meg, waving the precious paper<br/>and then proceeding to read it with girlish delight.<br/><br/>"'Mrs. Gardiner would be happy to see Miss March and Miss<br/>Josephine at a little dance on New Year's Eve.' Marmee is willing<br/>we should go, now what shall we wear?"<br/><br/>"What's the use of asking that, when you know we shall wear our<br/>poplins, because we haven't got anything else?" answered Jo with<br/>her mouth full.<br/><br/>"If I only had a silk!" sighed Meg. "Mother says I may when I'm<br/>eighteen perhaps, but two years is an everlasting time to<br/>wait."<br/><br/>"I'm sure our pops look like silk, and they are nice enough for<br/>us. Yours is as good as new, but I forgot the burn and the tear in<br/>mine. Whatever shall I do? The burn shows badly, and I can't take<br/>any out."<br/>
