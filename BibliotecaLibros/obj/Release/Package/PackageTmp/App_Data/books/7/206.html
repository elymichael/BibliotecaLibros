"Only a little, he's old for his age, and tall, and can be quite<br/>grown-up in his manners if he likes. Then he's rich and generous<br/>and good, and loves us all, and I say it's a pity my plan is<br/>spoiled."<br/><br/>"I'm afraid Laurie is hardly grown-up enough for Meg, and<br/>altogether too much of a weathercock just now for anyone to depend<br/>on. Don't make plans, Jo, but let time and their own hearts mate<br/>your friends. We can't meddle safely in such matters, and had<br/>better not get 'romantic rubbish' as you call it, into our heads,<br/>lest it spoil our friendship."<br/><br/>"Well, I won't, but I hate to see things going all crisscross<br/>and getting snarled up, when a pull here and a snip there would<br/>straighten it out. I wish wearing flatirons on our heads would keep<br/>us from growing up. But buds will be roses, and kittens cats,<br/>more's the pity!"<br/><br/>"What's that about flatirons and cats?" asked Meg, as she crept<br/>into the room with the finished letter in her hand.<br/><br/>"Only one of my stupid speeches. I'm going to bed. Come, Peggy,"<br/>said Jo, unfolding herself like an animated puzzle.<br/><br/>"Quite right, and beautifully written. Please add that I send my<br/>love to John," said Mrs. March, as she glanced over the letter and<br/>gave it back.<br/><br/>"Do you call him 'John'?" asked Meg, smiling, with her innocent<br/>eyes looking down into her mother's.<br/><br/>"Yes, he has been like a son to us, and we are very fond of<br/>him," replied Mrs. March, returning the look with a keen one.<br/><br/>"I'm glad of that, he is so lonely. Good night, Mother, dear. It<br/>is so inexpressibly comfortable to have you here," was Meg's<br/>answer.<br/><br/>The kiss her mother gave her was a very tender one, and as she<br/>went away, Mrs. March said, with a mixture of satisfaction and<br/>regret, "She does not love John yet, but will soon learn to."<br/><br/><br/>
