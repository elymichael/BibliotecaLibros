"I know I have no right to talk so to you, Laurie, and if you
weren't the sweetest-tempered fellow in the world, you'd be very
angry with me. But we are all so fond and proud of you, I couldn't
bear to think they should be disappointed in you at home as I have
been, though, perhaps they would understand the change better than
I do."

"I think they would," came from under the hat, in a grim tone,
quite as touching as a broken one.

"They ought to have told me, and not let me go blundering and
scolding, when I should have been more kind and patient than ever.
I never did like that Miss Randal and now I hate her!" said artful
Amy, wishing to be sure of her facts this time.

"Hang Miss Randal!" and Laurie knocked the hat off his face with
a look that left no doubt of his sentiments toward that young
lady.

"I beg pardon, I thoughtâ€¦ " and there she paused
diplomatically.

"No, you didn't, you knew perfectly well I never cared for
anyone but Jo," Laurie said that in his old, impetuous tone, and
turned his face away as he spoke.

"I did think so, but as they never said anything about it, and
you came away, I supposed I was mistaken. And Jo wouldn't be kind
to you? Why, I was sure she loved you dearly."

"She was kind, but not in the right way, and it's lucky for her
she didn't love me, if I'm the good-for-nothing fellow you think
me. It's her fault though, and you may tell her so."

The hard, bitter look came back again as he said that, and it
troubled Amy, for she did not know what balm to apply.

"I was wrong, I didn't know. I'm very sorry I was so cross, but
I can't help wishing you'd bear it better, Teddy, dear."

"Don't, that's her name for me!" and Laurie put up his hand with
a quick gesture to stop the words spoken in Jo's half-kind,
half-reproachful tone. "Wait till you've tried it yourself," he
added in a low voice, as he pulled up the grass by the handful.
