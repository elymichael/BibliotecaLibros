"Hurrah for Miss March, the celebrated American authoress!"<br/>cried Laurie, throwing up his hat and catching it again, to the<br/>great delight of two ducks, four cats, five hens, and half a dozen<br/>Irish children, for they were out of the city now.<br/><br/>"Hush! It won't come to anything, I dare say, but I couldn't<br/>rest till I had tried, and I said nothing about it because I didn't<br/>want anyone else to be disappointed."<br/><br/>"It won't fail. Why, Jo, your stories are works of Shakespeare<br/>compared to half the rubbish that is published every day. Won't it<br/>be fun to see them in print, and shan't we feel proud of our<br/>authoress?"<br/><br/>Jo's eyes sparkled, for it is always pleasant to be believed in,<br/>and a friend's praise is always sweeter than a dozen newspaper<br/>puffs.<br/><br/>"Where's your secret? Play fair, Teddy, or I'll never believe<br/>you again," she said, trying to extinguish the brilliant hopes that<br/>blazed up at a word of encouragement.<br/><br/>"I may get into a scrape for telling, but I didn't promise not<br/>to, so I will, for I never feel easy in my mind till I've told you<br/>any plummy bit of news I get. I know where Meg's glove is."<br/><br/>"Is that all?" said Jo, looking disappointed, as Laurie nodded<br/>and twinkled with a face full of mysterious intelligence.<br/><br/>"It's quite enough for the present, as you'll agree when I tell<br/>you where it is."<br/><br/>"Tell, then."<br/><br/>Laurie bent, and whispered three words in Jo's ear, which<br/>produced a comical change. She stood and stared at him for a<br/>minute, looking both surprised and displeased, then walked on,<br/>saying sharply, "How do you know?"<br/><br/>"Saw it."<br/>
