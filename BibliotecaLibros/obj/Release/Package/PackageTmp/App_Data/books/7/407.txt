My Lord and Lady


"Please, Madam Mother, could you lend me my wife for half an
hour? The luggage has come, and I've been making hay of Amy's Paris
finery, trying to find some things I want," said Laurie, coming in
the next day to find Mrs. Laurence sitting in her mother's lap, as
if being made 'the baby' again.

"Certainly. Go, dear, I forgot that you have any home but this,"

as if asking pardon for her maternal covetousness.

"I shouldn't have come over if I could have helped it, but I

with only an occasional whiffle round to the south, and I haven't
had an easterly spell since I was married. Don't know anything

lady?"

"Lovely weather so far. I don't know how long it will last, but
I'm not afraid of storms, for I'm learning how to sail my ship.
Come home, dear, and I'll find your bootjack. I suppose that's what
you are rummaging after among my things. Men are so helpless,
Mother," said Amy, with a matronly air, which delighted her
husband.

"What are you going to do with yourselves after you get
settled?" asked Jo, buttoning Amy's cloak as she used to button her
pinafores.
