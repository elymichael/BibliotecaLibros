Please let me take you home.<br/>It's all on my way, you know, and it rains, they say."<br/><br/>That settled it, and telling him of Meg's mishap, Jo gratefully<br/>accepted and rushed up to bring down the rest of the party. Hannah<br/>hated rain as much as a cat does so she made no trouble, and they<br/>rolled away in the luxurious close carriage, feeling very festive<br/>and elegant.

Did you?" asked Jo, rumpling up her hair,<br/>and making herself comfortable.<br/><br/>"Yes, till I hurt myself. Sallie's friend, Annie Moffat, took a<br/>fancy to me, and asked me to come and spend a week with her when<br/>Sallie does.

With many thanks, they said good night and crept in,<br/>hoping to disturb no one, but the instant their door creaked, two<br/>little nightcaps bobbed up, and two sleepy but eager voices cried<br/>outâ€¦<br/><br/>"Tell about the party!
