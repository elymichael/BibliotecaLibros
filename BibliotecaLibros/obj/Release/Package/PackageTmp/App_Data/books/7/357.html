<br/>"I know it, Meg, for I've tried it, and I seldom give advice<br/>unless I've proved its practicability. When you and Jo were little,<br/>I went on just as you are, feeling as if I didn't do my duty unless<br/>I devoted myself wholly to you. Poor Father took to his books,<br/>after I had refused all offers of help, and left me to try my<br/>experiment alone. I struggled along as well as I could, but Jo was<br/>too much for me. I nearly spoiled her by indulgence. You were<br/>poorly, and I worried about you till I fell sick myself. Then<br/>Father came to the rescue, quietly managed everything, and made<br/>himself so helpful that I saw my mistake, and never have been able<br/>to got on without him since. That is the secret of our home<br/>happiness. He does not let business wean him from the little cares<br/>and duties that affect us all, and I try not to let domestic<br/>worries destroy my interest in his pursuits. Each do our part alone<br/>in many things, but at home we work together, always."<br/><br/>"It is so, Mother, and my great wish is to be to my husband and<br/>children what you have been to yours. Show me how, I'll do anything<br/>you say."<br/><br/>"You always were my docile daughter. Well, dear, if I were you,<br/>I'd let John have more to do with the management of Demi, for the<br/>boy needs training, and it's none too soon to begin. Then I'd do<br/>what I have often proposed, let Hannah come and help you. She is a<br/>capital nurse, and you may trust the precious babies to her while<br/>you do more housework. You need the exercise, Hannah would enjoy<br/>the rest, and John would find his wife again. Go out more, keep<br/>cheerful as well as busy, for you are the sunshine-maker of the<br/>family, and if you get dismal there is no fair weather. Then I'd<br/>try to take an interest in whatever John likesâ€”talk with him, let<br/>him read to you, exchange ideas, and help each other in that way.<br/>Don't shut yourself up in a bandbox because you are a woman, but<br/>understand what is going on, and educate yourself to take your part<br/>in the world's work, for it all affects you and yours."<br/><br/>"John is so sensible, I'm afraid he will think I'm stupid if I<br/>ask questions about politics and things."<br/><br/>"I don't believe he would. Love covers a multitude of sins, and<br/>of whom could you ask more freely than of him? Try it, and see if<br/>he doesn't find your society far more agreeable than Mrs. Scott's<br/>suppers."<br/><br/>"I will. Poor John! I'm afraid I have neglected him sadly, but I<br/>thought I was right, and he never said anything."<br/><br/>"He tried not to be selfish, but he has felt rather forlorn, I<br/>fancy. This is just the time, Meg, when young married people are<br/>apt to grow apart, and the very time when they ought to be most<br/>together, for the first tenderness soon wears off, unless care is<br/>taken to preserve it. And no time is so beautiful and precious to<br/>parents as the first years of the little lives given to them to<br/>train. Don't let John be a stranger to the babies, for they will do<br/>more to keep him safe and happy in this world of trial and<br/>temptation than anything else, and through them you will learn to<br/>know and love one another as you should. Now, dear, good-by. Think<br/>over Mother's preachment, act upon it if it seems good, and God<br/>bless you all."<br/><br/>Meg did think it over, found it good, and acted upon it, though<br/>the first attempt was not made exactly as she planned to have it.<br/>Of course the children tyrannized over her, and ruled the house as<br/>soon as they found out that kicking and squalling brought them<br/>whatever they wanted. Mamma was an abject slave to their caprices,<br/>but Papa was not so easily subjugated, and occasionally afflicted<br/>his tender spouse by an attempt at paternal discipline with his<br/>obstreperous son. For Demi inherited a trifle of his sire's<br/>firmness of character, we won't call it obstinacy, and when he made<br/>up his little mind to have or to do anything, all the king's horses<br/>and all the king's men could not change that pertinacious little<br/>mind. Mamma thought the dear too young to be taught to conquer his<br/>prejudices, but Papa believed that it never was too soon to learn<br/>obedience. So Master Demi early discovered that when he undertook<br/>to 'wrastle' with 'Parpar', he always got the worst of it, yet like<br/>the Englishman, baby respected the man who conquered him, and loved<br/>the father whose grave "No, no," was more impressive than all<br/>Mamma's love pats.<br/><br/>A few days after the talk with her mother, Meg resolved to try a<br/>social evening with John, so she ordered a nice supper, set the<br/>parlor in order, dressed herself prettily, and put the children to<br/>bed early, that nothing should interfere with her experiment. But<br/>unfortunately Demi's most unconquerable prejudice was against going<br/>to bed, and that night he decided to go on a rampage. So poor Meg<br/>sang and rocked, told stories and tried every sleep-prevoking wile<br/>she could devise, but all in vain, the big eyes wouldn't shut, and<br/>long after Daisy had gone to byelow, like the chubby little bunch<br/>of good nature she was, naughty Demi lay staring at the light, with<br/>the most discouragingly wide-awake expression of countenance.<br/><br/>"Will Demi lie still like a good boy, while Mamma runs down and<br/>gives poor Papa his tea?" asked Meg, as the hall door softly<br/>closed, and the well-known step went tip-toeing into the dining<br/>room.<br/><br/>
