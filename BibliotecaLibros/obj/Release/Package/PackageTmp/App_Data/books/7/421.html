<br/>"You are going, then?"<br/><br/>"I haf no longer any business here, it is done."<br/><br/>"Successfully, I hope?" said Jo, for the bitterness of<br/>disappointment was in that short reply of his.<br/><br/>"I ought to think so, for I haf a way opened to me by which I<br/>can make my bread and gif my Junglings much help."<br/><br/>"Tell me, please! I like to know all about the—the boys," said<br/>Jo eagerly.<br/><br/>"That is so kind, I gladly tell you. My friends find for me a<br/>place in a college, where I teach as at home, and earn enough to<br/>make the way smooth for Franz and Emil.

When she met him she looked surprised, though it<br/>was impossible to help suspecting that she had come for that<br/>express purpose. When he offered her his arm, she took it with a<br/>look that filled him with delight, but when he asked if she missed<br/>him, she gave such a chilly, formal reply that despair fell upon<br/>him. On learning his good fortune she almost clapped her hands. Was<br/>the joy all for the boys? Then on hearing his destination, she<br/>said, "So far away!" in a tone of despair that lifted him on to a<br/>pinnacle of hope, but the next minute she tumbled him down again by<br/>observing, like one entirely absorbed in the matter…<br/><br/>
