<br/>"No, no. I mean what do you intend and wish to do?"<br/><br/>"Smoke a cigarette, if you'll allow me."<br/><br/>"How provoking you are! I don't approve of cigars and I will<br/>only allow it on condition that you let me put you into my sketch.<br/>I need a figure."<br/><br/>"With all the pleasure in life.
