<br/>"Unfortunately I have an engagement. Au revoir, madamoiselle,"<br/>and Laurie bent as if to kiss her hand, in the foreign fashion,<br/>which became him better than many men. Something in his face made<br/>Amy say quickly and warmlyâ€¦<br/><br/>"No, be yourself with me, Laurie, and part in the good old way.<br/>I'd rather have a hearty English handshake than all the sentimental<br/>salutations in France."<br/><br/>"Goodbye, dear," and with these words, uttered in the tone she<br/>liked, Laurie left her, after a handshake almost painful in its<br/>heartiness.<br/><br/>Next morning, instead of the usual call, Amy received a note<br/>which made her smile at the beginning and sigh at the end.<br/><br/><br/>My Dear Mentor, Please make my adieux to your<br/>aunt, and exult within yourself, for 'Lazy Laurence' has gone to<br/>his grandpa, like the best of boys. A pleasant winter to you, and<br/>may the gods grant you a blissful honeymoon at Valrosa! I think<br/>Fred would be benefited by a rouser. Tell him so, with my<br/>congratulations.<br/><br/>Yours gratefully, Telemachus<br/><br/><br/>"Good boy! I'm glad he's gone," said Amy, with an approving<br/>smile. The next minute her face fell as she glanced about the empty<br/>room, adding, with an involuntary sigh, "Yes, I am glad, but how I<br/>shall miss him."<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
