"I told you they dressed me up, but I didn't tell you that they
powdered and squeezed and frizzled, and made me look like a
fashion-plate. Laurie thought I wasn't proper. I know he did,
though he didn't say so, and one man called me 'a doll'. I knew it
was silly, but they flattered me and said I was a beauty, and
quantities of nonsense, so I let them make a fool of me."

"Is that all?" asked Jo, as Mrs. March looked silently at the
downcast face of her pretty daughter, and could not find it in her
heart to blame her little follies.

"No, I drank champagne and romped and tried to flirt, and was
altogether abominable," said Meg self-reproachfully.

"There is something more, I think." And Mrs. March smoothed the
soft cheek, which suddenly grew rosy as Meg answered slowlyâ€¦

"Yes. It's very silly, but I want to tell it, because I hate to
have people say and think such things about us and Laurie."

Then she told the various bits of gossip she had heard at the
Moffats', and as she spoke, Jo saw her mother fold her lips
tightly, as if ill pleased that such ideas should be put into Meg's
innocent mind.

"Well, if that isn't the greatest rubbish I ever heard," cried
Jo indignantly. "Why didn't you pop out and tell them so on the
spot?"

"I couldn't, it was so embarrassing for me. I couldn't help
hearing at first, and then I was so angry and ashamed, I didn't
remember that I ought to go away."

"Just wait till I see Annie Moffat, and I'll show you how to
settle such ridiculous stuff. The idea of having 'plans' and being
kind to Laurie because he's rich and may marry us by-and-by! Won't
he shout when I tell him what those silly things say about us poor
children?" And Jo laughed, as if on second thoughts the thing
struck her as a good joke.

"If you tell Laurie, I'll never forgive you! She mustn't, must
she, Mother?" said Meg, looking distressed.

"No, never repeat that foolish gossip, and forget it as soon as
you can," said Mrs. March gravely. "I was very unwise to let you go
among people of whom I know so little, kind, I dare say, but
worldly, ill-bred, and full of these vulgar ideas about young
people. I am more sorry than I can express for the mischief this
visit may have done you, Meg."
