<br/>"I used to be so frightened when it was my turn to sit in the<br/>chair with the crown on, and see you all come marching round to<br/>give the presents, with a kiss. I liked the things and the kisses,<br/>but it was dreadful to have you sit looking at me while I opened<br/>the bundles," said Beth, who was toasting her face and the bread<br/>for tea at the same time.<br/><br/>"Let Marmee think we are getting things for ourselves, and then<br/>surprise her. We must go shopping tomorrow afternoon, Meg. There is<br/>so much to do about the play for Christmas night," said Jo,<br/>marching up and down, with her hands behind her back, and her nose<br/>in the air.<br/><br/>"I don't mean to act any more after this time. I'm getting too<br/>old for such things," observed Meg, who was as much a child as ever<br/>about 'dressing-up' frolics.<br/><br/>"You won't stop, I know, as long as you can trail round in a<br/>white gown with your hair down, and wear gold-paper jewelry. You<br/>are the best actress we've got, and there'll be an end of<br/>everything if you quit the boards," said Jo. "We ought to rehearse<br/>tonight. Come here, Amy, and do the fainting scene, for you are as<br/>stiff as a poker in that."<br/><br/>"I can't help it. I never saw anyone faint, and I don't choose<br/>to make myself all black and blue, tumbling flat as you do. If I<br/>can go down easily, I'll drop. If I can't, I shall fall into a<br/>chair and be graceful. I don't care if Hugo does come at me with a<br/>pistol," returned Amy, who was not gifted with dramatic power, but<br/>was chosen because she was small enough to be borne out shrieking<br/>by the villain of the piece.<br/><br/>"Do it this way. Clasp your hands so, and stagger across the<br/>room, crying frantically, 'Roderigo! Save me! Save me!'" and away<br/>went Jo, with a melodramatic scream which was truly thrilling.<br/><br/>Amy followed, but she poked her hands out stiffly before her,<br/>and jerked herself along as if she went by machinery, and her "Ow!"<br/>was more suggestive of pins being run into her than of fear and<br/>anguish. Jo gave a despairing groan, and Meg laughed outright,<br/>while Beth let her bread burn as she watched the fun with interest.<br/>"It's no use! Do the best you can when the time comes, and if the<br/>audience laughs, don't blame me. Come on, Meg."<br/><br/>Then things went smoothly, for Don Pedro defied the world in a<br/>speech of two pages without a single break. Hagar, the witch,<br/>chanted an awful incantation over her kettleful of simmering toads,<br/>with weird effect. Roderigo rent his chains asunder manfully, and<br/>Hugo died in agonies of remorse and arsenic, with a wild, "Ha!<br/>Ha!"<br/><br/>"It's the best we've had yet," said Meg, as the dead villain sat<br/>up and rubbed his elbows.<br/><br/>"I don't see how you can write and act such splendid things, Jo.<br/>You're a regular Shakespeare!" exclaimed Beth, who firmly believed<br/>that her sisters were gifted with wonderful genius in all<br/>things.<br/><br/>
