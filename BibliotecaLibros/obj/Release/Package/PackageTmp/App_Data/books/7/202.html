<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>20<br/>Confidential<br/><br/><br/>I don't think I have any words in which to tell the meeting of<br/>the mother and daughters. Such hours are beautiful to live, but<br/>very hard to describe, so I will leave it to the imagination of my<br/>readers, merely saying that the house was full of genuine<br/>happiness, and that Meg's tender hope was realized, for when Beth<br/>woke from that long, healing sleep, the first objects on which her<br/>eyes fell were the little rose and Mother's face. Too weak to<br/>wonder at anything, she only smiled and nestled close in the loving<br/>arms about her, feeling that the hungry longing was satisfied at<br/>last. Then she slept again, and the girls waited upon their mother,<br/>for she would not unclasp the thin hand which clung to hers even in<br/>sleep.<br/><br/>Hannah had 'dished up' an astonishing breakfast for the<br/>traveler, finding it impossible to vent her excitement in any other<br/>way, and Meg and Jo fed their mother like dutiful young storks,<br/>while they listened to her whispered account of Father's state, Mr.<br/>Brooke's promise to stay and nurse him, the delays which the storm<br/>occasioned on the homeward journey, and the unspeakable comfort<br/>Laurie's hopeful face had given her when she arrived, worn out with<br/>fatigue, anxiety, and cold.<br/><br/>What a strange yet pleasant day that was. So brilliant and gay<br/>without, for all the world seemed abroad to welcome the first snow.<br/>So quiet and reposeful within, for everyone slept, spent with<br/>watching, and a Sabbath stillness reigned through the house, while<br/>nodding Hannah mounted guard at the door. With a blissful sense of<br/>burdens lifted off, Meg and Jo closed their weary eyes, and lay at<br/>rest, like storm-beaten boats safe at anchor in a quiet harbor.<br/>Mrs. March would not leave Beth's side, but rested in the big<br/>chair, waking often to look at, touch, and brood over her child,<br/>like a miser over some recovered treasure.<br/><br/>Laurie meanwhile posted off to comfort Amy, and told his story<br/>so well that Aunt March actually 'sniffed' herself, and never once<br/>said "I told you so". Amy came out so strong on this occasion that<br/>I think the good thoughts in the little chapel really began to bear<br/>fruit. She dried her tears quickly, restrained her impatience to<br/>see her mother, and never even thought of the turquoise ring, when<br/>the old lady heartily agreed in Laurie's opinion, that she behaved<br/>'like a capital little woman'. Even Polly seemed impressed, for he<br/>called her a good girl, blessed her buttons, and begged her to<br/>"come and take a walk, dear", in his most affable tone. She would<br/>very gladly have gone out to enjoy the bright wintry weather, but<br/>discovering that Laurie was dropping with sleep in spite of manful<br/>efforts to conceal the fact, she persuaded him to rest on the sofa,<br/>while she wrote a note to her mother. She was a long time about it,<br/>and when she returned, he was stretched out with both arms under<br/>his head, sound asleep, while Aunt March had pulled down the<br/>curtains and sat doing nothing in an unusual fit of benignity.<br/><br/>After a while, they began to think he was not going to wake up<br/>till night, and I'm not sure that he would, had he not been<br/>effectually roused by Amy's cry of joy at sight of her mother.<br/>There probably were a good many happy little girls in and about the<br/>city that day, but it is my private opinion that Amy was the<br/>happiest of all, when she sat in her mother's lap and told her<br/>trials, receiving consolation and compensation in the shape of<br/>approving smiles and fond caresses. They were alone together in the<br/>chapel, to which her mother did not object when its purpose was<br/>explained to her.<br/><br/>"On the contrary, I like it very much, dear," looking from the<br/>dusty rosary to the well-worn little book, and the lovely picture<br/>with its garland of evergreen. "It is an excellent plan to have<br/>some place where we can go to be quiet, when things vex or grieve<br/>us. There are a good many hard times in this life of ours, but we<br/>can always bear them if we ask help in the right way. I think my<br/>little girl is learning this."<br/><br/>"Yes, Mother, and when I go home I mean to have a corner in the<br/>big closet to put my books and the copy of that picture which I've<br/>tried to make. The woman's face is not good, it's too beautiful for<br/>me to draw, but the baby is done better, and I love it very much. I<br/>like to think He was a little child once, for then I don't seem so<br/>far away, and that helps me."<br/>
