"Talk to me, please. It's dull, sitting by myself," answered
Frank, who had evidently been used to being made much of at
home.

If he asked her to deliver a Latin oration, it would not have
seemed a more impossible task to bashful Beth, but there was no
place to run to, no Jo to hide behind now, and the poor boy looked
so wistfully at her that she bravely resolved to try.

"What do you like to talk about?" she asked, fumbling over the
cards and dropping half as she tried to tie them up.

"Well, I like to hear about cricket and boating and hunting,"
said Frank, who had not yet learned to suit his amusements to his
strength.

My heart! What shall I do? I don't know anything about them,
thought Beth, and forgetting the boy's misfortune in her flurry,
she said, hoping to make him talk, "I never saw any hunting, but I
suppose you know all about it."

"I did once, but I can never hunt again, for I got hurt leaping
a confounded five-barred gate, so there are no more horses and
hounds for me," said Frank with a sigh that made Beth hate herself
for her innocent blunder.

"Your deer are much prettier than our ugly buffaloes," she said,
turning to the prairies for help and feeling glad that she had read
one of the boys' books in which Jo delighted.

Buffaloes proved soothing and satisfactory, and in her eagerness
to amuse another, Beth forgot herself, and was quite unconscious of
her sisters' surprise and delight at the unusual spectacle of Beth
talking away to one of the dreadful boys, against whom she had
begged protection.

"Bless her heart! She pities him, so she is good to him," said
Jo, beaming at her from the croquet ground.

"I always said she was a little saint," added Meg, as if there
could be no further doubt of it.

"I haven't heard Frank laugh so much for ever so long," said
Grace to Amy, as they sat discussing dolls and making tea sets out
of the acorn cups.
