I laughed all the way downstairs, but it was a
little pathetic, also to think of the poor man having to mend his
own clothes. The German gentlemen embroider, I know, but darning
hose is another thing and not so pretty.

Saturday

Nothing has happened to write about, except a
call on Miss Norton, who has a room full of pretty things, and who
was very charming, for she showed me all her treasures, and asked
me if I would sometimes go with her to lectures and concerts, as
her escort, if I enjoyed them. She put it as a favor, but I'm sure
Mrs. Kirke has told her about us, and she does it out of kindness
to me. I'm as proud as Lucifer, but such favors from such people
don't burden me, and I accepted gratefully.

When I got back to the nursery there was such an
uproar in the parlor that I looked in, and there was Mr. Bhaer down
on his hands and knees, with Tina on his back, Kitty leading him
with a jump rope, and Minnie feeding two small boys with seedcakes,
as they roared and ramped in cages built of chairs.

"We are playing nargerie," explained Kitty.

"Dis is mine effalunt!" added Tina, holding on by
the Professor's hair.

"Mamma always allows us to do what we like
Saturday afternoon, when Franz and Emil come, doesn't she, Mr.
Bhaer?" said Minnie.

The 'effalunt' sat up, looking as much in earnest
as any of them, and said soberly to me, "I gif you my wort it is
so, if we make too large a noise you shall say Hush! to us, and we
go more softly."

I promised to do so, but left the door open and
enjoyed the fun as much as they did, for a more glorious frolic I
never witnessed. They played tag and soldiers, danced and sang, and
when it began to grow dark they all piled onto the sofa about the
Professor, while he told charming fairy stories of the storks on
the chimney tops, and the little 'koblods', who ride the snowflakes
as they fall. I wish Americans were as simple and natural as
Germans, don't you?
