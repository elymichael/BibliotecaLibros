<br/>"Then let me advise you to take up your little burdens again,<br/>for though they seem heavy sometimes, they are good for us, and<br/>lighten as we learn to carry them. Work is wholesome, and there is<br/>plenty for everyone. It keeps us from ennui and mischief, is good<br/>for health and spirits, and gives us a sense of power and<br/>independence better than money or fashion."<br/><br/>"We'll work like bees, and love it too, see if we don't," said<br/>Jo. "I'll learn plain cooking for my holiday task, and the next<br/>dinner party I have shall be a success."<br/><br/>"I'll make the set of shirts for father, instead of letting you<br/>do it, Marmee. I can and I will, though I'm not fond of sewing.<br/>That will be better than fussing over my own things, which are<br/>plenty nice enough as they are." said Meg.<br/><br/>"I'll do my lessons every day, and not spend so much time with<br/>my music and dolls. I am a stupid thing, and ought to be studying,<br/>not playing," was Beth's resolution, while Amy followed their<br/>example by heroically declaring, "I shall learn to make<br/>buttonholes, and attend to my parts of speech."<br/><br/>"Very good! Then I am quite satisfied with the experiment, and<br/>fancy that we shall not have to repeat it, only don't go to the<br/>other extreme and delve like slaves. Have regular hours for work<br/>and play, make each day both useful and pleasant, and prove that<br/>you understand the worth of time by employing it well. Then youth<br/>will be delightful, old age will bring few regrets, and life become<br/>a beautiful success, in spite of poverty."<br/><br/>"We'll remember, Mother!" and they did.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
