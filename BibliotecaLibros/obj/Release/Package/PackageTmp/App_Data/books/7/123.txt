Some english girls and boys are coming to see me
tomorrow and I want to have a jolly time. If it's fine, I'm going
to pitch my tent in Longmeadow, and row up the whole crew to lunch
and croquetâ€”have a fire, make messes, gypsy fashion, and all sorts
of larks. They are nice people, and like such things. Brooke will
go to keep us boys steady, and Kate Vaughn will play propriety for
the girls. I want you all to come, can't let Beth off at any price,
and nobody shall worry her. Don't bother about rations, I'll see to
that and everything else, only do come, there's a good fellow!

In a tearing hurry, Yours ever, Laurie.


"Here's richness!" cried Jo, flying in to tell the news to
Meg.

"Of course we can go, Mother? It will be such a help to Laurie,
for I can row, and Meg see to the lunch, and the children be useful
in some way."

"I hope the Vaughns are not fine grown-up people. Do you know
anything about them, Jo?" asked Meg.

"Only that there are four of them. Kate is older than you, Fred
and Frank (twins) about my age, and a little girl (Grace), who is
nine or ten. Laurie knew them abroad, and liked the boys. I
fancied, from the way he primmed up his mouth in speaking of her,
that he didn't admire Kate much."

"I'm so glad my French print is clean, it's just the thing and
so becoming!" observed Meg complacently. "Have you anything decent,
Jo?"

"Scarlet and gray boating suit, good enough for me. I shall row
and tramp about, so I don't want any starch to think of. You'll
come, Betty?"

"If you won't let any boys talk to me."

"Not a boy!"
