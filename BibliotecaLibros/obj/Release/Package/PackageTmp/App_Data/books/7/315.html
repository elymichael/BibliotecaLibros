"Now, my dear, make yourself at home," said Mrs.<br/>K. in her motherly way, "I'm on the drive from morning to night, as<br/>you may suppose with such a family, but a great anxiety will be off<br/>my mind if I know the children are safe with you. My rooms are<br/>always open to you, and your own shall be as comfortable as I can<br/>make it. There are some pleasant people in the house if you feel<br/>sociable, and your evenings are always free. Come to me if anything<br/>goes wrong, and be as happy as you can. There's the tea bell, I<br/>must run and change my cap." And off she bustled, leaving me to<br/>settle myself in my new nest.<br/><br/>As I went downstairs soon after, I saw something<br/>I liked. The flights are very long in this tall house, and as I<br/>stood waiting at the head of the third one for a little servant<br/>girl to lumber up, I saw a gentleman come along behind her, take<br/>the heavy hod of coal out of her hand, carry it all the way up, put<br/>it down at a door near by, and walk away, saying, with a kind nod<br/>and a foreign accent, "It goes better so. The little back is too<br/>young to haf such heaviness."<br/><br/>Wasn't it good of him? I like such things, for as<br/>Father says, trifles show character. When I mentioned it to Mrs.<br/>K., that evening, she laughed, and said, "That must have been<br/>Professor Bhaer, he's always doing things of that sort."<br/><br/>Mrs. K. told me he was from Berlin, very learned<br/>and good, but poor as a church mouse, and gives lessons to support<br/>himself and two little orphan nephews whom he is educating here,<br/>according to the wishes of his sister, who married an American. Not<br/>a very romantic story, but it interested me, and I was glad to hear<br/>that Mrs. K. lends him her parlor for some of his scholars. There<br/>is a glass door between it and the nursery, and I mean to peep at<br/>him, and then I'll tell you how he looks. He's almost forty, so<br/>it's no harm, Marmee.<br/><br/>After tea and a go-to-bed romp with the little<br/>girls, I attacked the big workbasket, and had a quiet evening<br/>chatting with my new friend. I shall keep a journal-letter, and<br/>send it once a week, so goodnight, and more tomorrow.<br/><br/>Tuesday Eve<br/><br/>Had a lively time in my seminary this morning,<br/>for the children acted like Sancho, and at one time I really<br/>thought I should shake them all round. Some good angel inspired me<br/>to try gymnastics, and I kept it up till they were glad to sit down<br/>and keep still. After luncheon, the girl took them out for a walk,<br/>and I went to my needlework like little Mabel 'with a willing<br/>mind'. I was thanking my stars that I'd learned to make nice<br/>buttonholes, when the parlor door opened and shut, and someone<br/>began to hum, Kennst Du Das Land, like a big bumblebee. It was<br/>dreadfully improper, I know, but I couldn't resist the temptation,<br/>and lifting one end of the curtain before the glass door, I peeped<br/>in. Professor Bhaer was there, and while he arranged his books, I<br/>took a good look at him. A regular Germanâ€”rather stout, with brown<br/>hair tumbled all over his head, a bushy beard, good nose, the<br/>kindest eyes I ever saw, and a splendid big voice that does one's<br/>ears good, after our sharp or slipshod American gabble. His clothes<br/>were rusty, his hands were large, and he hadn't a really handsome<br/>feature in his face, except his beautiful teeth, yet I liked him,<br/>for he had a fine head, his linen was very nice, and he looked like<br/>a gentleman, though two buttons were off his coat and there was a<br/>patch on one shoe. He looked sober in spite of his humming, till he<br/>went to the window to turn the hyacinth bulbs toward the sun, and<br/>stroke the cat, who received him like an old friend. Then he<br/>smiled, and when a tap came at the door, called out in a loud,<br/>brisk tone, "Herein!"<br/><br/>I was just going to run, when I caught sight of a<br/>morsel of a child carrying a big book, and stopped, to see what was<br/>going on.<br/><br/>"Me wants me Bhaer," said the mite, slamming down<br/>her book and running to meet him.<br/><br/>"Thou shalt haf thy Bhaer. Come, then, and take a<br/>goot hug from him, my Tina," said the Professor, catching her up<br/>with a laugh, and holding her so high over his head that she had to<br/>stoop her little face to kiss him.<br/><br/>"Now me mus tuddy my lessin," went on the funny<br/>little thing. So he put her up at the table, opened the great<br/>dictionary she had brought, and gave her a paper and pencil, and<br/>she scribbled away, turning a leaf now and then, and passing her<br/>little fat finger down the page, as if finding a word, so soberly<br/>that I nearly betrayed myself by a laugh, while Mr. Bhaer stood<br/>stroking her pretty hair with a fatherly look that made me think<br/>she must be his own, though she looked more French than German.<br/>
