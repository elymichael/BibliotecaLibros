"Here's the place for my errands. Will you come in? It won't<br/>take long."<br/><br/>Jo rather prided herself upon her shopping capabilities, and<br/>particularly wished to impress her escort with the neatness and<br/>dispatch with which she would accomplish the business. But owing to<br/>the flutter she was in, everything went amiss. She upset the tray<br/>of needles, forgot the silesia was to be 'twilled' till it was cut<br/>off, gave the wrong change, and covered herself with confusion by<br/>asking for lavender ribbon at the calico counter. Mr. Bhaer stood<br/>by, watching her blush and blunder, and as he watched, his own<br/>bewilderment seemed to subside, for he was beginning to see that on<br/>some occasions, women, like dreams, go by contraries.<br/><br/>When they came out, he put the parcel under his arm with a more<br/>cheerful aspect, and splashed through the puddles as if he rather<br/>enjoyed it on the whole.<br/><br/>"Should we no do a little what you call shopping for the babies,<br/>and haf a farewell feast tonight if I go for my last call at your<br/>so pleasant home?" he asked, stopping before a window full of fruit<br/>and flowers.<br/><br/>"What will we buy?" asked Jo, ignoring the latter part of his<br/>speech, and sniffing the mingled odors with an affectation of<br/>delight as they went in.<br/><br/>"May they haf oranges and figs?" asked Mr. Bhaer, with a<br/>paternal air.<br/><br/>"They eat them when they can get them."<br/><br/>"Do you care for nuts?"<br/><br/>"Like a squirrel."<br/><br/>"Hamburg grapes. Yes, we shall drink to the Fatherland in<br/>those?"<br/><br/>Jo frowned upon that piece of extravagance, and asked why he<br/>didn't buy a frail of dates, a cask of raisins, and a bag of<br/>almonds, and be done with it? Whereat Mr. Bhaer confiscated her<br/>purse, produced his own, and finished the marketing by buying<br/>several pounds of grapes, a pot of rosy daisies, and a pretty jar<br/>of honey, to be regarded in the light of a demijohn. Then<br/>distorting his pockets with knobby bundles, and giving her the<br/>flowers to hold, he put up the old umbrella, and they traveled on<br/>again.<br/>
