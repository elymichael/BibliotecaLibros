"What's the name?" asked Beth, wondering why Jo kept her face
behind the sheet.

"The Rival Painters."

"That sounds well. Read it," said Meg.

With a loud "Hem!" and a long breath, Jo began to read very
fast. The girls listened with interest, for the tale was romantic,
and somewhat pathetic, as most of the characters died in the end.
"I like that about the splendid picture," was Amy's approving
remark, as Jo paused.

"I prefer the lovering part. Viola and Angelo are two of our
favorite names, isn't that queer?" said Meg, wiping her eyes, for
the lovering part was tragical.

"Who wrote it?" asked Beth, who had caught a glimpse of Jo's
face.

The reader suddenly sat up, cast away the paper, displaying a
flushed countenance, and with a funny mixture of solemnity and
excitement replied in a loud voice, "Your sister."

"You?" cried Meg, dropping her work.

"It's very good," said Amy critically.

"I knew it! I knew it! Oh, my Jo, I am so proud!" and Beth ran
to hug her sister and exult over this splendid success.
