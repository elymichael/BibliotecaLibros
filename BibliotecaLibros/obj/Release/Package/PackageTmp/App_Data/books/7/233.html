<br/>"I shall marry whom I please, Aunt March, and you can leave your<br/>money to anyone you like," she said, nodding her head with a<br/>resolute air.<br/><br/>"Highty-tighty! Is that the way you take my advice, Miss? You'll<br/>be sorry for it by-and-by, when you've tried love in a cottage and<br/>found it a failure."<br/><br/>"It can't be a worse one than some people find in big houses,"<br/>retorted Meg.<br/><br/>Aunt March put on her glasses and took a look at the girl, for<br/>she did not know her in this new mood. Meg hardly knew herself, she<br/>felt so brave and independent, so glad to defend John and assert<br/>her right to love him, if she liked. Aunt March saw that she had<br/>begun wrong, and after a little pause, made a fresh start, saying<br/>as mildly as she could, "Now, Meg, my dear, be reasonable and take<br/>my advice. I mean it kindly, and don't want you to spoil your whole<br/>life by making a mistake at the beginning. You ought to marry well<br/>and help your family. It's your duty to make a rich match and it<br/>ought to be impressed upon you."<br/><br/>"Father and Mother don't think so. They like John though he is<br/>poor."<br/><br/>"Your parents, my dear, have no more worldly wisdom than a pair<br/>of babies."<br/><br/>"I'm glad of it," cried Meg stoutly.<br/><br/>Aunt March took no notice, but went on with her lecture. "This<br/>Rook is poor and hasn't got any rich relations, has he?"<br/><br/>"No, but he has many warm friends."<br/><br/>"You can't live on friends, try it and see how cool they'll<br/>grow. He hasn't any business, has he?"<br/><br/>
