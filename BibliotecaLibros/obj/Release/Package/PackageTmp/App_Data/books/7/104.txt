It is our painful duty to record the sudden and mysterious
disappearance of our cherished friend, Mrs. Snowball Pat Paw. This
lovely and beloved cat was the pet of a large circle of warm and
admiring friends; for her beauty attracted all eyes, her graces and
virtues endeared her to all hearts, and her loss is deeply felt by
the whole community.

When last seen, she was sitting at the gate, watching the
butcher's cart, and it is feared that some villain, tempted by her
charms, basely stole her. Weeks have passed, but no trace of her
has been discovered, and we relinquish all hope, tie a black ribbon
to her basket, set aside her dish, and weep for her as one lost to
us forever.

A LAMENT

(FOR S. B. PAT PAW)

We mourn the loss of our little pet,
And sigh o'er her hapless fate,
