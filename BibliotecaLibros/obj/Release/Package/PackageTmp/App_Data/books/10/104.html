<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>21<br/>Hendon to the rescue<br/><br/><br/>The old man glided away, stooping, stealthy, cat-like, and<br/>brought the low bench. &#160;He seated himself upon it, half his<br/>body in the dim and flickering light, and the other half in shadow;<br/>and so, with his craving eyes bent upon the slumbering boy, he kept<br/>his patient vigil there, heedless of the drift of time, and softly<br/>whetted his knife, and mumbled and chuckled; and in aspect and<br/>attitude he resembled nothing so much as a grizzly, monstrous<br/>spider, gloating over some hapless insect that lay bound and<br/>helpless in his web.<br/><br/>After a long while, the old man, who was still gazing,—yet not<br/>seeing, his mind having settled into a dreamy<br/>abstraction,—observed, on a sudden, that the boy's eyes were open!<br/>wide open and staring!—staring up in frozen horror at the knife.<br/>&#160;The smile of a gratified devil crept over the old man's face,<br/>and he said, without changing his attitude or his occupation—<br/><br/>"Son of Henry the Eighth, hast thou prayed?"<br/><br/>The boy struggled helplessly in his bonds, and at the same time<br/>forced a smothered sound through his closed jaws, which the hermit<br/>chose to interpret as an affirmative answer to his question.<br/><br/>"Then pray again. &#160;Pray the prayer for the dying!"<br/><br/>A shudder shook the boy's frame, and his face blenched.<br/>&#160;Then he struggled again to free himself—turning and twisting<br/>himself this way and that; tugging frantically, fiercely,<br/>desperately—but uselessly—to burst his fetters; and all the while<br/>the old ogre smiled down upon him, and nodded his head, and<br/>placidly whetted his knife; mumbling, from time to time, "The<br/>moments are precious, they are few and precious—pray the prayer for<br/>the dying!"<br/><br/>The boy uttered a despairing groan, and ceased from his<br/>struggles, panting. &#160;The tears came, then, and trickled, one<br/>after the other, down his face; but this piteous sight wrought no<br/>softening effect upon the savage old man.<br/>
