One of the nobles knelt at the royal couch, and said—

"The King's majesty knoweth that the Hereditary Great Marshal of
England lieth attainted in the Tower. &#160;It were not meet that
one attainted—"

"Peace! &#160;Insult not mine ears with his hated name. &#160;Is
this man to live for ever? &#160;Am I to be baulked of my will?
&#160;Is the prince to tarry uninstalled, because, forsooth, the
realm lacketh an Earl Marshal free of treasonable taint to invest
him with his honours? No, by the splendour of God! &#160;Warn my
Parliament to bring me Norfolk's doom before the sun rise again,
else shall they answer for it grievously!"
[3]

Lord Hertford said—

"The King's will is law;" and, rising, returned to his former
place.

Gradually the wrath faded out of the old King's face, and he
said—

"Kiss me, my prince. &#160;There&#160;… what fearest thou?
&#160;Am I not thy loving father?"

"Thou art good to me that am unworthy, O mighty and gracious
lord: that in truth I know. &#160;But—but—it grieveth me to think
of him that is to die, and—"

"Ah, 'tis like thee, 'tis like thee! &#160;I know thy heart is
still the same, even though thy mind hath suffered hurt, for thou
wert ever of a gentle spirit. &#160;But this duke standeth between
thee and thine honours: &#160;I will have another in his stead that
shall bring no taint to his great office. Comfort thee, my prince:
&#160;trouble not thy poor head with this matter."

"But is it not I that speed him hence, my liege? &#160;How long
might he not live, but for me?"
