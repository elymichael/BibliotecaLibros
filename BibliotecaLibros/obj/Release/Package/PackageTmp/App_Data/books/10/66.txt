The boy rose, and stood at graceful ease, but with an aspect of
concern in his face. &#160;He said—

"Of a surety thou must remember me, my lord. &#160;I am thy
whipping-boy."

"My WHIPPING-boy?"

"The same, your Grace. &#160;I am Humphrey—Humphrey Marlow."

Tom perceived that here was someone whom his keepers ought to
have posted him about. &#160;The situation was delicate. &#160;What
should he do?—pretend he knew this lad, and then betray by his
every utterance that he had never heard of him before? &#160;No,
that would not do. &#160;An idea came to his relief: accidents like
this might be likely to happen with some frequency, now that
business urgencies would often call Hertford and St. John from his
side, they being members of the Council of Executors; therefore
perhaps it would be well to strike out a plan himself to meet the
requirements of such emergencies. &#160;Yes, that would be a wise
course—he would practise on this boy, and see what sort of success
he might achieve. &#160;So he stroked his brow perplexedly a moment
or two, and presently said—

"Now I seem to remember thee somewhat—but my wit is clogged and
dim with suffering—"

"Alack, my poor master!" ejaculated the whipping-boy, with
feeling; adding, to himself, "In truth 'tis as they said—his mind
is gone—alas, poor soul! &#160;But misfortune catch me, how am I
forgetting! &#160;They said one must not seem to observe that aught
is wrong with him."

"'Tis strange how my memory doth wanton with me these days,"
said Tom. "But mind it not—I mend apace—a little clue doth often
serve to bring me back again the things and names which had escaped
me. &#160;(And not they, only, forsooth, but e'en such as I ne'er
heard before—as this lad shall see.) &#160;Give thy business
speech."

"'Tis matter of small weight, my liege, yet will I touch upon
it, an' it please your Grace. &#160;Two days gone by, when your
Majesty faulted thrice in your Greek—in the morning lessons,—dost
remember it?"

"Y-e-s—methinks I do. &#160;(It is not much of a lie—an' I had
meddled with the Greek at all, I had not faulted simply thrice, but
forty times.) Yes, I do recall it, now—go on."

"The master, being wroth with what he termed such slovenly and
doltish work, did promise that he would soundly whip me for
it—and—"
