The justice maintained his judicial composure, and simply
said—

"Doubtless it is allowable to revise the value, since it is not
yet writ upon the record."

"Then in God's name call the pig eightpence, and heaven bless
the day that freed my conscience of this awesome thing!"

Miles Hendon forgot all decorum in his delight; and surprised
the King and wounded his dignity, by throwing his arms around him
and hugging him. The woman made her grateful adieux and started
away with her pig; and when the constable opened the door for her,
he followed her out into the narrow hall. &#160;The justice
proceeded to write in his record book. &#160;Hendon, always alert,
thought he would like to know why the officer followed the woman
out; so he slipped softly into the dusky hall and listened.
&#160;He heard a conversation to this effect—

"It is a fat pig, and promises good eating; I will buy it of
thee; here is the eightpence."

"Eightpence, indeed! &#160;Thou'lt do no such thing. &#160;It
cost me three shillings and eightpence, good honest coin of the
last reign, that old Harry that's just dead ne'er touched or
tampered with. &#160;A fig for thy eightpence!"

"Stands the wind in that quarter? &#160;Thou wast under oath,
and so swore falsely when thou saidst the value was but eightpence.
&#160;Come straightway back with me before his worship, and answer
for the crime!—and then the lad will hang."

"There, there, dear heart, say no more, I am content. &#160;Give
me the eightpence, and hold thy peace about the matter."

The woman went off crying: &#160;Hendon slipped back into the
court room, and the constable presently followed, after hiding his
prize in some convenient place. &#160;The justice wrote a while
longer, then read the King a wise and kindly lecture, and sentenced
him to a short imprisonment in the common jail, to be followed by a
public flogging. &#160;The astounded King opened his mouth, and was
probably going to order the good judge to be beheaded on the spot;
but he caught a warning sign from Hendon, and succeeded in closing
his mouth again before he lost anything out of it. Hendon took him
by the hand, now, made reverence to the justice, and the two
departed in the wake of the constable toward the jail. &#160;The
moment the street was reached, the inflamed monarch halted,
snatched away his hand, and exclaimed—

"Idiot, dost imagine I will enter a common jail ALIVE?"

Hendon bent down and said, somewhat sharply—
