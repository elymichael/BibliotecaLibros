"True, true—that is well—be comforted, tremble not so; there is
none here would hurt thee; there is none here but loves thee. Thou
art better now; thy ill dream passeth—is't not so? &#160;Thou wilt
not miscall thyself again, as they say thou didst a little while
agone?"

"I pray thee of thy grace believe me, I did but speak the truth,
most dread lord; for I am the meanest among thy subjects, being a
pauper born, and 'tis by a sore mischance and accident I am here,
albeit I was therein nothing blameful. &#160;I am but young to die,
and thou canst save me with one little word. &#160;Oh speak it,
sir!"

"Die? &#160;Talk not so, sweet prince—peace, peace, to thy
troubled heart—thou shalt not die!"

Tom dropped upon his knees with a glad cry—

"God requite thy mercy, O my King, and save thee long to bless
thy land!" Then springing up, he turned a joyful face toward the
two lords in waiting, and exclaimed, "Thou heard'st it! &#160;I am
not to die: &#160;the King hath said it!" &#160;There was no
movement, save that all bowed with grave respect; but no one spoke.
&#160;He hesitated, a little confused, then turned timidly toward
the King, saying, "I may go now?"

"Go? &#160;Surely, if thou desirest. &#160;But why not tarry yet
a little? Whither would'st go?"

Tom dropped his eyes, and answered humbly—

"Peradventure I mistook; but I did think me free, and so was I
moved to seek again the kennel where I was born and bred to misery,
yet which harboureth my mother and my sisters, and so is home to
me; whereas these pomps and splendours whereunto I am not used—oh,
please you, sir, to let me go!"

The King was silent and thoughtful a while, and his face
betrayed a growing distress and uneasiness. &#160;Presently he
said, with something of hope in his voice—

"Perchance he is but mad upon this one strain, and hath his wits
unmarred as toucheth other matter. &#160;God send it may be so!
&#160;We will make trial."
