<br/>When breakfast was over, the housewife told the King to wash up<br/>the dishes. &#160;This command was a staggerer, for a moment, and<br/>the King came near rebelling; but then he said to himself, "Alfred<br/>the Great watched the cakes; doubtless he would have washed the<br/>dishes too—therefore will I essay it."<br/><br/>He made a sufficiently poor job of it; and to his surprise too,<br/>for the cleaning of wooden spoons and trenchers had seemed an easy<br/>thing to do. It was a tedious and troublesome piece of work, but he<br/>finished it at last. &#160;He was becoming impatient to get away on<br/>his journey now; however, he was not to lose this thrifty dame's<br/>society so easily. &#160;She furnished him some little odds and<br/>ends of employment, which he got through with after a fair fashion<br/>and with some credit. &#160;Then she set him and the little girls<br/>to paring some winter apples; but he was so awkward at this service<br/>that she retired him from it and gave him a butcher knife to<br/>grind.<br/><br/>Afterwards she kept him carding wool until he began to think he<br/>had laid the good King Alfred about far enough in the shade for the<br/>present in the matter of showy menial heroisms that would read<br/>picturesquely in story-books and histories, and so he was<br/>half-minded to resign. &#160;And when, just after the noonday<br/>dinner, the goodwife gave him a basket of kittens to drown, he did<br/>resign. &#160;At least he was just going to resign—for he felt that<br/>he must draw the line somewhere, and it seemed to him that to draw<br/>it at kitten-drowning was about the right thing—when there was an<br/>interruption. &#160;The interruption was John Canty—with a<br/>peddler's pack on his back—and Hugo.<br/><br/>The King discovered these rascals approaching the front gate<br/>before they had had a chance to see him; so he said nothing about<br/>drawing the line, but took up his basket of kittens and stepped<br/>quietly out the back way, without a word. &#160;He left the<br/>creatures in an out-house, and hurried on, into a narrow lane at<br/>the rear.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
