"Will they scourge thee? &#160;No, no, they would not be so
cruel! &#160;Say they would not. &#160;Come, they WILL not, will
they?"

The women betrayed confusion and distress, but there was no
avoiding an answer, so one of them said, in a voice choked with
emotion—

"Oh, thou'lt break our hearts, thou gentle spirit!—God will help
us to bear our—"

"It is a confession!" the King broke in. &#160;"Then they WILL
scourge thee, the stony-hearted wretches! &#160;But oh, thou must
not weep, I cannot bear it. &#160;Keep up thy courage—I shall come
to my own in time to save thee from this bitter thing, and I will
do it!"

When the King awoke in the morning, the women were gone.

"They are saved!" he said, joyfully; then added, despondently,
"but woe is me!—for they were my comforters."

Each of them had left a shred of ribbon pinned to his clothing,
in token of remembrance. &#160;He said he would keep these things
always; and that soon he would seek out these dear good friends of
his and take them under his protection.

Just then the jailer came in with some subordinates, and
commanded that the prisoners be conducted to the jail-yard.
&#160;The King was overjoyed—it would be a blessed thing to see the
blue sky and breathe the fresh air once more. &#160;He fretted and
chafed at the slowness of the officers, but his turn came at last,
and he was released from his staple and ordered to follow the other
prisoners with Hendon.

The court or quadrangle was stone-paved, and open to the sky.
&#160;The prisoners entered it through a massive archway of
masonry, and were placed in file, standing, with their backs
against the wall. A rope was stretched in front of them, and they
were also guarded by their officers. It was a chill and lowering
morning, and a light snow which had fallen during the night
whitened the great empty space and added to the general dismalness
of its aspect. Now and then a wintry wind shivered through the
place and sent the snow eddying hither and thither.

In the centre of the court stood two women, chained to posts.
&#160;A glance showed the King that these were his good friends.
&#160;He shuddered, and said to himself, "Alack, they are not gone
free, as I had thought. &#160;To think that such as these should
know the lash!—in England! &#160;Ay, there's the shame of it—not in
Heathennesse, Christian England! &#160;They will be scourged; and
I, whom they have comforted and kindly entreated, must look on and
see the great wrong done; it is strange, so strange, that I, the
very source of power in this broad realm, am helpless to protect
them. But let these miscreants look well to themselves, for there
is a day coming when I will require of them a heavy reckoning for
this work. &#160;For every blow they strike now, they shall feel a
hundred then."
