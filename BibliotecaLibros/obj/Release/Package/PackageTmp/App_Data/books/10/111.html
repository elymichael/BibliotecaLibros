"Now speed ye after me with the rest, and cry 'Stop thief!' but<br/>mind ye lead them astray!"<br/><br/>The next moment Hugo turned a corner and darted down a crooked<br/>alley—and in another moment or two he lounged into view again,<br/>looking innocent and indifferent, and took up a position behind a<br/>post to watch results.<br/><br/>The insulted King threw the bundle on the ground; and the<br/>blanket fell away from it just as the woman arrived, with an<br/>augmenting crowd at her heels; she seized the King's wrist with one<br/>hand, snatched up her bundle with the other, and began to pour out<br/>a tirade of abuse upon the boy while he struggled, without success,<br/>to free himself from her grip.<br/><br/>Hugo had seen enough—his enemy was captured and the law would<br/>get him, now—so he slipped away, jubilant and chuckling, and wended<br/>campwards, framing a judicious version of the matter to give to the<br/>Ruffler's crew as he strode along.<br/><br/>The King continued to struggle in the woman's strong grasp, and<br/>now and then cried out in vexation—<br/><br/>"Unhand me, thou foolish creature; it was not I that bereaved<br/>thee of thy paltry goods."<br/><br/>The crowd closed around, threatening the King and calling him<br/>names; a brawny blacksmith in leather apron, and sleeves rolled to<br/>his elbows, made a reach for him, saying he would trounce him well,<br/>for a lesson; but just then a long sword flashed in the air and<br/>fell with convincing force upon the man's arm, flat side down, the<br/>fantastic owner of it remarking pleasantly, at the same time—<br/><br/>"Marry, good souls, let us proceed gently, not with ill blood<br/>and uncharitable words. &#160;This is matter for the law's<br/>consideration, not private and unofficial handling. &#160;Loose thy<br/>hold from the boy, goodwife."<br/><br/>The blacksmith averaged the stalwart soldier with a glance, then<br/>went muttering away, rubbing his arm; the woman released the boy's<br/>wrist reluctantly; the crowd eyed the stranger unlovingly, but<br/>prudently closed their mouths. &#160;The King sprang to his<br/>deliverer's side, with flushed cheeks and sparkling eyes,<br/>exclaiming—<br/><br/>"Thou hast lagged sorely, but thou comest in good season, now,<br/>Sir Miles; carve me this rabble to rags!"<br/><br/><br/>
