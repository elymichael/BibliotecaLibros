"It is the law, your Grace—for poisoners. &#160;In Germany
coiners be boiled to death in OIL—not cast in of a sudden, but by a
rope let down into the oil by degrees, and slowly; first the feet,
then the legs, then—"

"O prithee no more, my lord, I cannot bear it!" cried Tom,
covering his eyes with his hands to shut out the picture. &#160;"I
beseech your good lordship that order be taken to change this
law—oh, let no more poor creatures be visited with its
tortures."

The Earl's face showed profound gratification, for he was a man
of merciful and generous impulses—a thing not very common with his
class in that fierce age. &#160;He said—

"These your Grace's noble words have sealed its doom.
&#160;History will remember it to the honour of your royal
house."

The under-sheriff was about to remove his prisoner; Tom gave him
a sign to wait; then he said—

"Good sir, I would look into this matter further. &#160;The man
has said his deed was but lamely proved. &#160;Tell me what thou
knowest."

"If the King's grace please, it did appear upon the trial that
this man entered into a house in the hamlet of Islington where one
lay sick—three witnesses say it was at ten of the clock in the
morning, and two say it was some minutes later—the sick man being
alone at the time, and sleeping—and presently the man came forth
again and went his way. &#160;The sick man died within the hour,
being torn with spasms and retchings."

"Did any see the poison given? &#160;Was poison found?"

"Marry, no, my liege."

"Then how doth one know there was poison given at all?"

"Please your Majesty, the doctors testified that none die with
such symptoms but by poison."
