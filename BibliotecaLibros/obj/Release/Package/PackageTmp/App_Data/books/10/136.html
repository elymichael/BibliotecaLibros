"Since the last day of January."<br/><br/>"And prithee who made him so?"<br/><br/>"Himself and the Great Council—with help of the King."<br/><br/>His Majesty started violently. &#160;"The KING!" he cried.<br/>&#160;"WHAT king, good sir?"<br/><br/>"What king, indeed! (God-a-mercy, what aileth the boy?)<br/>&#160;Sith we have but one, 'tis not difficult to answer—his most<br/>sacred Majesty King Edward the Sixth—whom God preserve! &#160;Yea,<br/>and a dear and gracious little urchin is he, too; and whether he be<br/>mad or no—and they say he mendeth daily—his praises are on all<br/>men's lips; and all bless him, likewise, and offer prayers that he<br/>may be spared to reign long in England; for he began humanely with<br/>saving the old Duke of Norfolk's life, and now is he bent on<br/>destroying the cruellest of the laws that harry and oppress the<br/>people."<br/><br/>This news struck his Majesty dumb with amazement, and plunged<br/>him into so deep and dismal a reverie that he heard no more of the<br/>old man's gossip. He wondered if the 'little urchin' was the<br/>beggar-boy whom he left dressed in his own garments in the palace.<br/>&#160;It did not seem possible that this could be, for surely his<br/>manners and speech would betray him if he pretended to be the<br/>Prince of Wales—then he would be driven out, and search made for<br/>the true prince. &#160;Could it be that the Court had set up some<br/>sprig of the nobility in his place? &#160;No, for his uncle would<br/>not allow that—he was all-powerful and could and would crush such a<br/>movement, of course. &#160;The boy's musings profited him nothing;<br/>the more he tried to unriddle the mystery the more perplexed he<br/>became, the more his head ached, and the worse he slept. &#160;His<br/>impatience to get to London grew hourly, and his captivity became<br/>almost unendurable.<br/><br/>Hendon's arts all failed with the King—he could not be<br/>comforted; but a couple of women who were chained near him<br/>succeeded better. Under their gentle ministrations he found peace<br/>and learned a degree of patience. &#160;He was very grateful, and<br/>came to love them dearly and to delight in the sweet and soothing<br/>influence of their presence. &#160;He asked them why they were in<br/>prison, and when they said they were Baptists, he smiled, and<br/>inquired—<br/><br/>"Is that a crime to be shut up for in a prison? &#160;Now I<br/>grieve, for I shall lose ye—they will not keep ye long for such a<br/>little thing."<br/><br/>They did not answer; and something in their faces made him<br/>uneasy. He said, eagerly—<br/><br/>"You do not speak; be good to me, and tell me—there will be no<br/>other punishment? &#160;Prithee tell me there is no fear of<br/>that."<br/><br/>They tried to change the topic, but his fears were aroused, and<br/>he pursued it—<br/>
