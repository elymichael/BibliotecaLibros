The Prince with the tramps


The troop of vagabonds turned out at early dawn, and set forward
on their march. &#160;There was a lowering sky overhead, sloppy
ground under foot, and a winter chill in the air. &#160;All gaiety
was gone from the company; some were sullen and silent, some were
irritable and petulant, none were gentle-humoured, all were
thirsty.

The Ruffler put 'Jack' in Hugo's charge, with some brief
instructions, and commanded John Canty to keep away from him and
let him alone; he also warned Hugo not to be too rough with the
lad.

After a while the weather grew milder, and the clouds lifted
somewhat. The troop ceased to shiver, and their spirits began to
improve. &#160;They grew more and more cheerful, and finally began
to chaff each other and insult passengers along the highway.
&#160;This showed that they were awaking to an appreciation of life
and its joys once more. &#160;The dread in which their sort was
held was apparent in the fact that everybody gave them the road,
and took their ribald insolences meekly, without venturing to talk
back. They snatched linen from the hedges, occasionally in full
view of the owners, who made no protest, but only seemed grateful
that they did not take the hedges, too.

By-and-by they invaded a small farmhouse and made themselves at
home while the trembling farmer and his people swept the larder
clean to furnish a breakfast for them. &#160;They chucked the
housewife and her daughters under the chin whilst receiving the
food from their hands, and made coarse jests about them,
accompanied with insulting epithets and bursts of horse-laughter.
&#160;They threw bones and vegetables at the farmer and his sons,
kept them dodging all the time, and applauded uproariously when a
good hit was made. They ended by buttering the head of one of the
daughters who resented some of their familiarities. &#160;When they
took their leave they threatened to come back and burn the house
over the heads of the family if any report of their doings got to
the ears of the authorities.

About noon, after a long and weary tramp, the gang came to a
halt behind a hedge on the outskirts of a considerable village.
&#160;An hour was allowed for rest, then the crew scattered
themselves abroad to enter the village at different points to ply
their various trades—'Jack' was sent with Hugo. &#160;They wandered
hither and thither for some time, Hugo watching for opportunities
to do a stroke of business, but finding none—so he finally
said—

"I see nought to steal; it is a paltry place. &#160;Wherefore we
will beg."

"WE, forsooth! &#160;Follow thy trade—it befits thee. &#160;But
_I_ will not beg."
