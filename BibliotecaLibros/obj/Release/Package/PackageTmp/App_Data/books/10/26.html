<br/>One of the nobles knelt at the royal couch, and said—<br/><br/>"The King's majesty knoweth that the Hereditary Great Marshal of<br/>England lieth attainted in the Tower. &#160;It were not meet that<br/>one attainted—"<br/><br/>"Peace! &#160;Insult not mine ears with his hated name. &#160;Is<br/>this man to live for ever? &#160;Am I to be baulked of my will?<br/>&#160;Is the prince to tarry uninstalled, because, forsooth, the<br/>realm lacketh an Earl Marshal free of treasonable taint to invest<br/>him with his honours? No, by the splendour of God! &#160;Warn my<br/>Parliament to bring me Norfolk's doom before the sun rise again,<br/>else shall they answer for it grievously!"<br/>[3]<br/><br/>Lord Hertford said—<br/><br/>"The King's will is law;" and, rising, returned to his former<br/>place.<br/><br/>Gradually the wrath faded out of the old King's face, and he<br/>said—<br/><br/>"Kiss me, my prince. &#160;There&#160;… what fearest thou?<br/>&#160;Am I not thy loving father?"<br/><br/>"Thou art good to me that am unworthy, O mighty and gracious<br/>lord: that in truth I know. &#160;But—but—it grieveth me to think<br/>of him that is to die, and—"<br/><br/>"Ah, 'tis like thee, 'tis like thee! &#160;I know thy heart is<br/>still the same, even though thy mind hath suffered hurt, for thou<br/>wert ever of a gentle spirit. &#160;But this duke standeth between<br/>thee and thine honours: &#160;I will have another in his stead that<br/>shall bring no taint to his great office. Comfort thee, my prince:<br/>&#160;trouble not thy poor head with this matter."<br/><br/>"But is it not I that speed him hence, my liege? &#160;How long<br/>might he not live, but for me?"<br/>
