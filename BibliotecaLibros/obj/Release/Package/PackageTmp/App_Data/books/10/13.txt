"None, sir. &#160;Would'st have them take off their garment, and
sleep without—like the beasts?"

"Their garment! &#160;Have they but one?"

"Ah, good your worship, what would they do with more?
&#160;Truly they have not two bodies each."

"It is a quaint and marvellous thought! &#160;Thy pardon, I had
not meant to laugh. &#160;But thy good Nan and thy Bet shall have
raiment and lackeys enow, and that soon, too: &#160;my cofferer
shall look to it. &#160;No, thank me not; 'tis nothing. &#160;Thou
speakest well; thou hast an easy grace in it. &#160;Art
learned?"

"I know not if I am or not, sir. &#160;The good priest that is
called Father Andrew taught me, of his kindness, from his
books."

"Know'st thou the Latin?"

"But scantly, sir, I doubt."

"Learn it, lad: &#160;'tis hard only at first. &#160;The Greek
is harder; but neither these nor any tongues else, I think, are
hard to the Lady Elizabeth and my cousin. &#160;Thou should'st hear
those damsels at it! &#160;But tell me of thy Offal Court.
&#160;Hast thou a pleasant life there?"

"In truth, yes, so please you, sir, save when one is hungry.
There be Punch-and-Judy shows, and monkeys—oh such antic creatures!
and so bravely dressed!—and there be plays wherein they that play
do shout and fight till all are slain, and 'tis so fine to see, and
costeth but a farthing—albeit 'tis main hard to get the farthing,
please your worship."

"Tell me more."

"We lads of Offal Court do strive against each other with the
cudgel, like to the fashion of the 'prentices, sometimes."
