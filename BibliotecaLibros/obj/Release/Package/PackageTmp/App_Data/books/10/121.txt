25
Hendon Hall


As soon as Hendon and the King were out of sight of the
constable, his Majesty was instructed to hurry to a certain place
outside the town, and wait there, whilst Hendon should go to the
inn and settle his account. Half an hour later the two friends were
blithely jogging eastward on Hendon's sorry steeds. &#160;The King
was warm and comfortable, now, for he had cast his rags and clothed
himself in the second-hand suit which Hendon had bought on London
Bridge.

Hendon wished to guard against over-fatiguing the boy; he judged
that hard journeys, irregular meals, and illiberal measures of
sleep would be bad for his crazed mind; whilst rest, regularity,
and moderate exercise would be pretty sure to hasten its cure; he
longed to see the stricken intellect made well again and its
diseased visions driven out of the tormented little head; therefore
he resolved to move by easy stages toward the home whence he had so
long been banished, instead of obeying the impulse of his
impatience and hurrying along night and day.

When he and the King had journeyed about ten miles, they reached
a considerable village, and halted there for the night, at a good
inn. &#160;The former relations were resumed; Hendon stood behind
the King's chair, while he dined, and waited upon him; undressed
him when he was ready for bed; then took the floor for his own
quarters, and slept athwart the door, rolled up in a blanket.

The next day, and the day after, they jogged lazily along
talking over the adventures they had met since their separation,
and mightily enjoying each other's narratives. &#160;Hendon
detailed all his wide wanderings in search of the King, and
described how the archangel had led him a fool's journey all over
the forest, and taken him back to the hut, finally, when he found
he could not get rid of him. &#160;Then—he said—the old man went
into the bedchamber and came staggering back looking
broken-hearted, and saying he had expected to find that the boy had
returned and laid down in there to rest, but it was not so.
&#160;Hendon had waited at the hut all day; hope of the King's
return died out, then, and he departed upon the quest again.

"And old Sanctum Sanctorum WAS truly sorry your highness came
not back," said Hendon; "I saw it in his face."

"Marry I will never doubt THAT!" said the King—and then told his
own story; after which, Hendon was sorry he had not destroyed the
archangel.

During the last day of the trip, Hendon's spirits were soaring.
His tongue ran constantly. &#160;He talked about his old father,
and his brother Arthur, and told of many things which illustrated
their high and generous characters; he went into loving frenzies
over his Edith, and was so glad-hearted that he was even able to
say some gentle and brotherly things about Hugh. &#160;He dwelt a
deal on the coming meeting at Hendon Hall; what a surprise it would
be to everybody, and what an outburst of thanksgiving and delight
there would be.
