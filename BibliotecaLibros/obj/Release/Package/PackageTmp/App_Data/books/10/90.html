These and twenty other cries broke out at once! and almost<br/>before the poor little victim could draw a breath he was crowned<br/>with a tin basin, robed in a tattered blanket, throned upon a<br/>barrel, and sceptred with the tinker's soldering-iron. &#160;Then<br/>all flung themselves upon their knees about him and sent up a<br/>chorus of ironical wailings, and mocking supplications, whilst they<br/>swabbed their eyes with their soiled and ragged sleeves and<br/>aprons—<br/><br/>"Be gracious to us, O sweet King!"<br/><br/>"Trample not upon thy beseeching worms, O noble Majesty!"<br/><br/>"Pity thy slaves, and comfort them with a royal kick!"<br/><br/>"Cheer us and warm us with thy gracious rays, O flaming sun of<br/>sovereignty!"<br/><br/>"Sanctify the ground with the touch of thy foot, that we may eat<br/>the dirt and be ennobled!"<br/><br/>"Deign to spit upon us, O Sire, that our children's children may<br/>tell of thy princely condescension, and be proud and happy for<br/>ever!"<br/><br/>But the humorous tinker made the 'hit' of the evening and<br/>carried off the honours. &#160;Kneeling, he pretended to kiss the<br/>King's foot, and was indignantly spurned; whereupon he went about<br/>begging for a rag to paste over the place upon his face which had<br/>been touched by the foot, saying it must be preserved from contact<br/>with the vulgar air, and that he should make his fortune by going<br/>on the highway and exposing it to view at the rate of a hundred<br/>shillings a sight. &#160;He made himself so killingly funny that he<br/>was the envy and admiration of the whole mangy rabble.<br/><br/>Tears of shame and indignation stood in the little monarch's<br/>eyes; and the thought in his heart was, "Had I offered them a deep<br/>wrong they could not be more cruel—yet have I proffered nought but<br/>to do them a kindness—and it is thus they use me for it!"<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
