After a moment's thought, the servant said—

"When he came, none came with him; but now I remember me that as
the two stepped into the throng of the Bridge, a ruffian-looking
man plunged out from some near place; and just as he was joining
them—"

"What THEN?—out with it!" thundered the impatient Hendon,
interrupting.

"Just then the crowd lapped them up and closed them in, and I
saw no more, being called by my master, who was in a rage because a
joint that the scrivener had ordered was forgot, though I take all
the saints to witness that to blame ME for that miscarriage were
like holding the unborn babe to judgment for sins com—"

"Out of my sight, idiot! &#160;Thy prating drives me mad!
&#160;Hold! Whither art flying? &#160;Canst not bide still an
instant? &#160;Went they toward Southwark?"

"Even so, your worship—for, as I said before, as to that
detestable joint, the babe unborn is no whit more blameless
than—"

"Art here YET! &#160;And prating still! &#160;Vanish, lest I
throttle thee!" The servitor vanished. &#160;Hendon followed after
him, passed him, and plunged down the stairs two steps at a stride,
muttering, "'Tis that scurvy villain that claimed he was his son.
&#160;I have lost thee, my poor little mad master—it is a bitter
thought—and I had come to love thee so! &#160;No! by book and bell,
NOT lost! &#160;Not lost, for I will ransack the land till I find
thee again. &#160;Poor child, yonder is his breakfast—and mine, but
I have no hunger now; so, let the rats have it—speed, speed! that
is the word!" &#160;As he wormed his swift way through the noisy
multitudes upon the Bridge he several times said to
himself—clinging to the thought as if it were a particularly
pleasing one—"He grumbled, but he WENT—he went, yes, because he
thought Miles Hendon asked it, sweet lad—he would ne'er have done
it for another, I know it well."
