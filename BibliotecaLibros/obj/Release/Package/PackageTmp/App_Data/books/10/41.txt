The Prince in the toils


We left John Canty dragging the rightful prince into Offal
Court, with a noisy and delighted mob at his heels. &#160;There was
but one person in it who offered a pleading word for the captive,
and he was not heeded; he was hardly even heard, so great was the
turmoil. &#160;The Prince continued to struggle for freedom, and to
rage against the treatment he was suffering, until John Canty lost
what little patience was left in him, and raised his oaken cudgel
in a sudden fury over the Prince's head. &#160;The single pleader
for the lad sprang to stop the man's arm, and the blow descended
upon his own wrist. &#160;Canty roared out—

"Thou'lt meddle, wilt thou? &#160;Then have thy reward."

His cudgel crashed down upon the meddler's head: &#160;there was
a groan, a dim form sank to the ground among the feet of the crowd,
and the next moment it lay there in the dark alone. &#160;The mob
pressed on, their enjoyment nothing disturbed by this episode.

Presently the Prince found himself in John Canty's abode, with
the door closed against the outsiders. &#160;By the vague light of
a tallow candle which was thrust into a bottle, he made out the
main features of the loathsome den, and also the occupants of it.
&#160;Two frowsy girls and a middle-aged woman cowered against the
wall in one corner, with the aspect of animals habituated to harsh
usage, and expecting and dreading it now. From another corner stole
a withered hag with streaming grey hair and malignant eyes.
&#160;John Canty said to this one—

"Tarry! &#160;There's fine mummeries here. &#160;Mar them not
till thou'st enjoyed them: &#160;then let thy hand be heavy as thou
wilt. &#160;Stand forth, lad. &#160;Now say thy foolery again, an
thou'st not forgot it. Name thy name. &#160;Who art thou?"

The insulted blood mounted to the little prince's cheek once
more, and he lifted a steady and indignant gaze to the man's face
and said—

"'Tis but ill-breeding in such as thou to command me to speak.
&#160;I tell thee now, as I told thee before, I am Edward, Prince
of Wales, and none other."
