Several old heads among the assemblage nodded their recognition<br/>of the wisdom of this question. &#160;The sheriff, however, saw<br/>nothing consequential in the inquiry; he answered, with simple<br/>directness—<br/><br/>"Indeed did she, your Majesty, and most righteously, as all<br/>aver. Her habitation was swept away, and herself and child left<br/>shelterless."<br/><br/>"Methinks the power to do herself so ill a turn was dearly<br/>bought.
