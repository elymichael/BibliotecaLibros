Miles Hendon and Tom Canty were favourites of the King, all<br/>through his brief reign, and his sincere mourners when he died. The<br/>good Earl of Kent had too much sense to abuse his peculiar<br/>privilege; but he exercised it twice after the instance we have<br/>seen of it before he was called from this world—once at the<br/>accession of Queen Mary, and once at the accession of Queen<br/>Elizabeth. &#160;A descendant of his exercised it at the accession<br/>of James I. &#160;Before this one's son chose to use the privilege,<br/>near a quarter of a century had elapsed, and the 'privilege of the<br/>Kents' had faded out of most people's memories; so, when the Kent<br/>of that day appeared before Charles I. and his court and sat down<br/>in the sovereign's presence to assert and perpetuate the right of<br/>his house, there was a fine stir indeed! &#160;But the matter was<br/>soon explained, and the right confirmed. &#160;The last Earl of the<br/>line fell in the wars of the Commonwealth fighting for the King,<br/>and the odd privilege ended with him.<br/><br/>Tom Canty lived to be a very old man, a handsome, white-haired<br/>old fellow, of grave and benignant aspect. &#160;As long as he<br/>lasted he was honoured; and he was also reverenced, for his<br/>striking and peculiar costume kept the people reminded that 'in his<br/>time he had been royal;' so, wherever he appeared the crowd fell<br/>apart, making way for him, and whispering, one to another, "Doff<br/>thy hat, it is the King's Ward!"—and so they saluted, and got his<br/>kindly smile in return—and they valued it, too, for his was an<br/>honourable history.<br/><br/>Yes, King Edward VI. lived only a few years, poor boy, but he<br/>lived them worthily. &#160;More than once, when some great<br/>dignitary, some gilded vassal of the crown, made argument against<br/>his leniency, and urged that some law which he was bent upon<br/>amending was gentle enough for its purpose, and wrought no<br/>suffering or oppression which any one need mightily mind, the young<br/>King turned the mournful eloquence of his great compassionate eyes<br/>upon him and answered—<br/><br/>"What dost THOU know of suffering and oppression? &#160;I and my<br/>people know, but not thou."<br/><br/>The reign of Edward VI. was a singularly merciful one for those<br/>harsh times. &#160;Now that we are taking leave of him, let us try<br/>to keep this in our minds, to his credit.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
