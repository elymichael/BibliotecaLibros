<br/>"I have learned the story of these past few weeks, and am well<br/>pleased with thee. &#160;Thou hast governed the realm with right<br/>royal gentleness and mercy. &#160;Thou hast found thy mother and<br/>thy sisters again? &#160;Good; they shall be cared forâ€”and thy<br/>father shall hang, if thou desire it and the law consent.<br/>&#160;Know, all ye that hear my voice, that from this day, they<br/>that abide in the shelter of Christ's Hospital and share the King's<br/>bounty shall have their minds and hearts fed, as well as their<br/>baser parts; and this boy shall dwell there, and hold the chief<br/>place in its honourable body of governors, during life. &#160;And<br/>for that he hath been a king, it is meet that other than common<br/>observance shall be his due; wherefore note this his dress of<br/>state, for by it he shall be known, and none shall copy it; and<br/>wheresoever he shall come, it shall remind the people that he hath<br/>been royal, in his time, and none shall deny him his due of<br/>reverence or fail to give him salutation. &#160;He hath the<br/>throne's protection, he hath the crown's support, he shall be known<br/>and called by the honourable title of the King's Ward."<br/><br/>The proud and happy Tom Canty rose and kissed the King's hand,<br/>and was conducted from the presence. &#160;He did not waste any<br/>time, but flew to his mother, to tell her and Nan and Bet all about<br/>it and get them to help him enjoy the great news.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
