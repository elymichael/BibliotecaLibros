<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>4<br/>The Prince's troubles begin<br/><br/><br/>After hours of persistent pursuit and persecution, the little<br/>prince was at last deserted by the rabble and left to himself.<br/>&#160;As long as he had been able to rage against the mob, and<br/>threaten it royally, and royally utter commands that were good<br/>stuff to laugh at, he was very entertaining; but when weariness<br/>finally forced him to be silent, he was no longer of use to his<br/>tormentors, and they sought amusement elsewhere. He looked about<br/>him, now, but could not recognise the locality. &#160;He was within<br/>the city of London—that was all he knew. &#160;He moved on,<br/>aimlessly, and in a little while the houses thinned, and the<br/>passers-by were infrequent. &#160;He bathed his bleeding feet in<br/>the brook which flowed then where Farringdon Street now is; rested<br/>a few moments, then passed on, and presently came upon a great<br/>space with only a few scattered houses in it, and a prodigious<br/>church. &#160;He recognised this church. &#160;Scaffoldings were<br/>about, everywhere, and swarms of workmen; for it was undergoing<br/>elaborate repairs. &#160;The prince took heart at once—he felt that<br/>his troubles were at an end, now. &#160;He said to himself, "It is<br/>the ancient Grey Friars' Church, which the king my father hath<br/>taken from the monks and given for a home for ever for poor and<br/>forsaken children, and new-named it Christ's Church. &#160;Right<br/>gladly will they serve the son of him who hath done so generously<br/>by them—and the more that that son is himself as poor and as<br/>forlorn as any that be sheltered here this day, or ever shall<br/>be."<br/><br/>He was soon in the midst of a crowd of boys who were running,<br/>jumping, playing at ball and leap-frog, and otherwise disporting<br/>themselves, and right noisily, too. &#160;They were all dressed<br/>alike, and in the fashion which in that day prevailed among<br/>serving-men and 'prentices<br/>[1]<br/>—that is to<br/>say, each had on the crown of his head a flat black cap about the<br/>size of a saucer, which was not useful as a covering, it being of<br/>such scanty dimensions, neither was it ornamental; from beneath it<br/>the hair fell, unparted, to the middle of the forehead, and was<br/>cropped straight around; a clerical band at the neck; a blue gown<br/>that fitted closely and hung as low as the knees or lower; full<br/>sleeves; a broad red belt; bright yellow stockings, gartered above<br/>the knees; low shoes with large metal buckles. It was a<br/>sufficiently ugly costume.<br/><br/>The boys stopped their play and flocked about the prince, who<br/>said with native dignity—<br/><br/>"Good lads, say to your master that Edward Prince of Wales<br/>desireth speech with him."<br/><br/>A great shout went up at this, and one rude fellow said—<br/><br/>"Marry, art thou his grace's messenger, beggar?"<br/>
