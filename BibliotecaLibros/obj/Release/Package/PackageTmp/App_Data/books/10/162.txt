The disturbance attracted his Majesty's attention, who stretched
forth his hand and cried out—

"Touch him not, it is his right!"

The throng fell back, stupefied. &#160;The King went on—

"Learn ye all, ladies, lords, and gentlemen, that this is my
trusty and well-beloved servant, Miles Hendon, who interposed his
good sword and saved his prince from bodily harm and possible
death—and for this he is a knight, by the King's voice. &#160;Also
learn, that for a higher service, in that he saved his sovereign
stripes and shame, taking these upon himself, he is a peer of
England, Earl of Kent, and shall have gold and lands meet for the
dignity. &#160;More—the privilege which he hath just exercised is
his by royal grant; for we have ordained that the chiefs of his
line shall have and hold the right to sit in the presence of the
Majesty of England henceforth, age after age, so long as the crown
shall endure. &#160;Molest him not."

Two persons, who, through delay, had only arrived from the
country during this morning, and had now been in this room only
five minutes, stood listening to these words and looking at the
King, then at the scarecrow, then at the King again, in a sort of
torpid bewilderment. &#160;These were Sir Hugh and the Lady Edith.
&#160;But the new Earl did not see them. &#160;He was still staring
at the monarch, in a dazed way, and muttering—

"Oh, body o' me! &#160;THIS my pauper! &#160;This my lunatic!
&#160;This is he whom _I_ would show what grandeur was, in my house
of seventy rooms and seven-and-twenty servants! &#160;This is he
who had never known aught but rags for raiment, kicks for comfort,
and offal for diet! &#160;This is he whom _I_ adopted and would
make respectable! Would God I had a bag to hide my head in!"

Then his manners suddenly came back to him, and he dropped upon
his knees, with his hands between the King's, and swore allegiance
and did homage for his lands and titles. &#160;Then he rose and
stood respectfully aside, a mark still for all eyes—and much envy,
too.

Now the King discovered Sir Hugh, and spoke out with wrathful
voice and kindling eye—

"Strip this robber of his false show and stolen estates, and put
him under lock and key till I have need of him."

The late Sir Hugh was led away.

There was a stir at the other end of the room, now; the
assemblage fell apart, and Tom Canty, quaintly but richly clothed,
marched down, between these living walls, preceded by an usher.
&#160;He knelt before the King, who said—
