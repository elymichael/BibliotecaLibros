Hendon to the rescue


The old man glided away, stooping, stealthy, cat-like, and
brought the low bench. &#160;He seated himself upon it, half his
body in the dim and flickering light, and the other half in shadow;
and so, with his craving eyes bent upon the slumbering boy, he kept
his patient vigil there, heedless of the drift of time, and softly
whetted his knife, and mumbled and chuckled; and in aspect and
attitude he resembled nothing so much as a grizzly, monstrous
spider, gloating over some hapless insect that lay bound and
helpless in his web.

After a long while, the old man, who was still gazing,—yet not
seeing, his mind having settled into a dreamy
abstraction,—observed, on a sudden, that the boy's eyes were open!
wide open and staring!—staring up in frozen horror at the knife.
&#160;The smile of a gratified devil crept over the old man's face,
and he said, without changing his attitude or his occupation—

"Son of Henry the Eighth, hast thou prayed?"

The boy struggled helplessly in his bonds, and at the same time
forced a smothered sound through his closed jaws, which the hermit
chose to interpret as an affirmative answer to his question.

"Then pray again. &#160;Pray the prayer for the dying!"

A shudder shook the boy's frame, and his face blenched.
&#160;Then he struggled again to free himself—turning and twisting
himself this way and that; tugging frantically, fiercely,
desperately—but uselessly—to burst his fetters; and all the while
the old ogre smiled down upon him, and nodded his head, and
placidly whetted his knife; mumbling, from time to time, "The
moments are precious, they are few and precious—pray the prayer for
the dying!"

The boy uttered a despairing groan, and ceased from his
struggles, panting. &#160;The tears came, then, and trickled, one
after the other, down his face; but this piteous sight wrought no
softening effect upon the savage old man.
