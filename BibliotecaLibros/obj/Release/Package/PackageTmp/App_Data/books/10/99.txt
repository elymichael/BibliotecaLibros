When breakfast was over, the housewife told the King to wash up
the dishes. &#160;This command was a staggerer, for a moment, and
the King came near rebelling; but then he said to himself, "Alfred
the Great watched the cakes; doubtless he would have washed the
dishes too—therefore will I essay it."

He made a sufficiently poor job of it; and to his surprise too,
for the cleaning of wooden spoons and trenchers had seemed an easy
thing to do. It was a tedious and troublesome piece of work, but he
finished it at last. &#160;He was becoming impatient to get away on
his journey now; however, he was not to lose this thrifty dame's
society so easily. &#160;She furnished him some little odds and
ends of employment, which he got through with after a fair fashion
and with some credit. &#160;Then she set him and the little girls
to paring some winter apples; but he was so awkward at this service
that she retired him from it and gave him a butcher knife to
grind.

Afterwards she kept him carding wool until he began to think he
had laid the good King Alfred about far enough in the shade for the
present in the matter of showy menial heroisms that would read
picturesquely in story-books and histories, and so he was
half-minded to resign. &#160;And when, just after the noonday
dinner, the goodwife gave him a basket of kittens to drown, he did
resign. &#160;At least he was just going to resign—for he felt that
he must draw the line somewhere, and it seemed to him that to draw
it at kitten-drowning was about the right thing—when there was an
interruption. &#160;The interruption was John Canty—with a
peddler's pack on his back—and Hugo.

The King discovered these rascals approaching the front gate
before they had had a chance to see him; so he said nothing about
drawing the line, but took up his basket of kittens and stepped
quietly out the back way, without a word. &#160;He left the
creatures in an out-house, and hurried on, into a narrow lane at
the rear.
