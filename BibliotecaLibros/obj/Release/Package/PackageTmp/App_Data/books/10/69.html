"Thanks, O most noble master, this princely lavishness doth far<br/>surpass my most distempered dreams of fortune. &#160;Now shall I be<br/>happy all my days, and all the house of Marlow after me."<br/><br/>Tom had wit enough to perceive that here was a lad who could be<br/>useful to him. &#160;He encouraged Humphrey to talk, and he was<br/>nothing loath. &#160;He was delighted to believe that he was<br/>helping in Tom's 'cure'; for always, as soon as he had finished<br/>calling back to Tom's diseased mind the various particulars of his<br/>experiences and adventures in the royal school-room and elsewhere<br/>about the palace, he noticed that Tom was then able to 'recall' the<br/>circumstances quite clearly. &#160;At the end of an hour Tom found<br/>himself well freighted with very valuable information concerning<br/>personages and matters pertaining to the Court; so he resolved to<br/>draw instruction from this source daily; and to this end he would<br/>give order to admit Humphrey to the royal closet whenever he might<br/>come, provided the Majesty of England was not engaged with other<br/>people. &#160;Humphrey had hardly been dismissed when my Lord<br/>Hertford arrived with more trouble for Tom.<br/><br/>He said that the Lords of the Council, fearing that some<br/>overwrought report of the King's damaged health might have leaked<br/>out and got abroad, they deemed it wise and best that his Majesty<br/>should begin to dine in public after a day or two—his wholesome<br/>complexion and vigorous step, assisted by a carefully guarded<br/>repose of manner and ease and grace of demeanour, would more surely<br/>quiet the general pulse—in case any evil rumours HAD gone<br/>about—than any other scheme that could be devised.<br/><br/>Then the Earl proceeded, very delicately, to instruct Tom as to<br/>the observances proper to the stately occasion, under the rather<br/>thin disguise of 'reminding' him concerning things already known to<br/>him; but to his vast gratification it turned out that Tom needed<br/>very little help in this line—he had been making use of Humphrey in<br/>that direction, for Humphrey had mentioned that within a few days<br/>he was to begin to dine in public; having gathered it from the<br/>swift-winged gossip of the Court. Tom kept these facts to himself,<br/>however.<br/><br/>Seeing the royal memory so improved, the Earl ventured to apply<br/>a few tests to it, in an apparently casual way, to find out how far<br/>its amendment had progressed. &#160;The results were happy, here<br/>and there, in spots—spots where Humphrey's tracks remained—and on<br/>the whole my lord was greatly pleased and encouraged. &#160;So<br/>encouraged was he, indeed, that he spoke up and said in a quite<br/>hopeful voice—<br/><br/>"Now am I persuaded that if your Majesty will but tax your<br/>memory yet a little further, it will resolve the puzzle of the<br/>Great Seal—a loss which was of moment yesterday, although of none<br/>to-day, since its term of service ended with our late lord's life.<br/>May it please your Grace to make the trial?"<br/><br/>Tom was at sea—a Great Seal was something which he was totally<br/>unacquainted with. &#160;After a moment's hesitation he looked up<br/>innocently and asked—<br/><br/>"What was it like, my lord?"<br/><br/>The Earl started, almost imperceptibly, muttering to himself,<br/>"Alack, his wits are flown again!—it was ill wisdom to lead him on<br/>to strain them"—then he deftly turned the talk to other matters,<br/>with the purpose of sweeping the unlucky seal out of Tom's<br/>thoughts—a purpose which easily succeeded.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
