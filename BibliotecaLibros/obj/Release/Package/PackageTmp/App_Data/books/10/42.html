<br/>The stunning surprise of this reply nailed the hag's feet to the<br/>floor where she stood, and almost took her breath. &#160;She stared<br/>at the Prince in stupid amazement, which so amused her ruffianly<br/>son, that he burst into a roar of laughter. &#160;But the effect<br/>upon Tom Canty's mother and sisters was different. &#160;Their<br/>dread of bodily injury gave way at once to distress of a different<br/>sort. &#160;They ran forward with woe and dismay in their faces,<br/>exclaiming—<br/><br/>"Oh, poor Tom, poor lad!"<br/><br/>The mother fell on her knees before the Prince, put her hands<br/>upon his shoulders, and gazed yearningly into his face through her<br/>rising tears. Then she said—<br/><br/>"Oh, my poor boy! &#160;Thy foolish reading hath wrought its<br/>woeful work at last, and ta'en thy wit away. &#160;Ah! why did'st<br/>thou cleave to it when I so warned thee 'gainst it? &#160;Thou'st<br/>broke thy mother's heart."<br/><br/>The Prince looked into her face, and said gently—<br/><br/>"Thy son is well, and hath not lost his wits, good dame.<br/>&#160;Comfort thee: let me to the palace where he is, and<br/>straightway will the King my father restore him to thee."<br/><br/>"The King thy father! &#160;Oh, my child! unsay these words that<br/>be freighted with death for thee, and ruin for all that be near to<br/>thee. &#160;Shake of this gruesome dream. &#160;Call back thy poor<br/>wandering memory. &#160;Look upon me. Am not I thy mother that bore<br/>thee, and loveth thee?"<br/><br/>The Prince shook his head and reluctantly said—<br/><br/>"God knoweth I am loth to grieve thy heart; but truly have I<br/>never looked upon thy face before."<br/><br/>The woman sank back to a sitting posture on the floor, and,<br/>covering her eyes with her hands, gave way to heart-broken sobs and<br/>wailings.<br/><br/>
