A few minutes later the little Prince of Wales was garlanded
with Tom's fluttering odds and ends, and the little Prince of
Pauperdom was tricked out in the gaudy plumage of royalty.
&#160;The two went and stood side by side before a great mirror,
and lo, a miracle: there did not seem to have been any change made!
&#160;They stared at each other, then at the glass, then at each
other again. &#160;At last the puzzled princeling said—

"What dost thou make of this?"

"Ah, good your worship, require me not to answer. &#160;It is
not meet that one of my degree should utter the thing."

"Then will _I_ utter it. &#160;Thou hast the same hair, the same
eyes, the same voice and manner, the same form and stature, the

national importance that lay upon a table, and was out at the door
and flying through the palace grounds in his bannered rags, with a
hot face and glowing eyes. &#160;As soon as he reached the great
gate, he seized the bars, and tried to shake them, shouting—

"Open! &#160;Unbar the gates!"

The soldier that had maltreated Tom obeyed promptly; and as the
prince burst through the portal, half-smothered with royal wrath,
the soldier fetched him a sounding box on the ear that sent him
whirling to the roadway, and said—

"Take that, thou beggar's spawn, for what thou got'st me from
his Highness!"

The crowd roared with laughter. &#160;The prince picked himself
out of the mud, and made fiercely at the sentry, shouting—
