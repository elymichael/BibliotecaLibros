"Let the show go on!" shouted Canty. &#160;"What, Nan!—what,<br/>Bet! mannerless wenches! will ye stand in the Prince's presence?<br/>&#160;Upon your knees, ye pauper scum, and do him reverence!"<br/><br/>He followed this with another horse-laugh. &#160;The girls began<br/>to plead timidly for their brother; and Nan said—<br/><br/>"An thou wilt but let him to bed, father, rest and sleep will<br/>heal his madness: &#160;prithee, do."<br/><br/>"Do, father," said Bet; "he is more worn than is his wont.<br/>&#160;To-morrow will he be himself again, and will beg with<br/>diligence, and come not empty home again."<br/><br/>This remark sobered the father's joviality, and brought his mind<br/>to business. &#160;He turned angrily upon the Prince, and said—<br/><br/>"The morrow must we pay two pennies to him that owns this hole;<br/>two pennies, mark ye—all this money for a half-year's rent, else<br/>out of this we go. &#160;Show what thou'st gathered with thy lazy<br/>begging."<br/><br/>The Prince said—<br/><br/>"Offend me not with thy sordid matters. &#160;I tell thee again<br/>I am the King's son."<br/><br/>A sounding blow upon the Prince's shoulder from Canty's broad<br/>palm sent him staggering into goodwife Canty's arms, who clasped<br/>him to her breast, and sheltered him from a pelting rain of cuffs<br/>and slaps by interposing her own person. &#160;The frightened girls<br/>retreated to their corner; but the grandmother stepped eagerly<br/>forward to assist her son. &#160;The Prince sprang away from Mrs.<br/>Canty, exclaiming—<br/><br/>"Thou shalt not suffer for me, madam. &#160;Let these swine do<br/>their will upon me alone."<br/><br/>This speech infuriated the swine to such a degree that they set<br/>about their work without waste of time. &#160;Between them they<br/>belaboured the boy right soundly, and then gave the girls and their<br/>mother a beating for showing sympathy for the victim.<br/>
