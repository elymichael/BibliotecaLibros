<br/>Tom's poor mother and sisters travelled the same road out of his<br/>mind. At first he pined for them, sorrowed for them, longed to see<br/>them, but later, the thought of their coming some day in their rags<br/>and dirt, and betraying him with their kisses, and pulling him down<br/>from his lofty place, and dragging him back to penury and<br/>degradation and the slums, made him shudder. &#160;At last they<br/>ceased to trouble his thoughts almost wholly. &#160;And he was<br/>content, even glad: &#160;for, whenever their mournful and accusing<br/>faces did rise before him now, they made him feel more despicable<br/>than the worms that crawl.<br/><br/>At midnight of the 19th of February, Tom Canty was sinking to<br/>sleep in his rich bed in the palace, guarded by his loyal vassals,<br/>and surrounded by the pomps of royalty, a happy boy; for tomorrow<br/>was the day appointed for his solemn crowning as King of England.<br/>At that same hour, Edward, the true king, hungry and thirsty,<br/>soiled and draggled, worn with travel, and clothed in rags and<br/>shreds—his share of the results of the riot—was wedged in among a<br/>crowd of people who were watching with deep interest certain<br/>hurrying gangs of workmen who streamed in and out of Westminster<br/>Abbey, busy as ants: &#160;they were making the last preparation<br/>for the royal coronation.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
