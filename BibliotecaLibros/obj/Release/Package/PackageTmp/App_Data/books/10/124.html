Miles's voice was subdued, and his lips trembled.<br/>&#160;"My father dead!—oh, this is heavy news. &#160;Half my new<br/>joy is withered now. &#160;Prithee let me see my brother Arthur—he<br/>will know me; he will know me and console me."<br/><br/>"He, also, is dead."<br/><br/>"God be merciful to me, a stricken man! &#160;Gone,—both<br/>gone—the worthy taken and the worthless spared, in me! &#160;Ah! I<br/>crave your mercy!—do not say the Lady Edith—"<br/><br/>"Is dead? &#160;No, she lives."<br/><br/>"Then, God be praised, my joy is whole again! &#160;Speed thee,<br/>brother—let her come to me! &#160;An' SHE say I am not myself—but<br/>she will not; no, no, SHE will know me, I were a fool to doubt it.<br/>Bring her—bring the old servants; they, too, will know me."<br/><br/>
