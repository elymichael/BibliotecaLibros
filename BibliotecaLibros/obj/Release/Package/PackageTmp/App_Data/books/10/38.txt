"It grieveth me, my lord the King, to bear so heavy and
unwelcome tidings; but it is the will of God that the prince's
affliction abideth still, and he cannot recall to mind that he
received the Seal. &#160;So came I quickly to report, thinking it
were waste of precious time, and little worth withal, that any
should attempt to search the long array of chambers and saloons
that belong unto his royal high—"

A groan from the King interrupted the lord at this point.
&#160;After a little while his majesty said, with a deep sadness in
his tone—

"Trouble him no more, poor child. &#160;The hand of God lieth
heavy upon him, and my heart goeth out in loving compassion for
him, and sorrow that I may not bear his burden on mine old
trouble-weighted shoulders, and so bring him peace."

He closed his eyes, fell to mumbling, and presently was silent.
After a time he opened his eyes again, and gazed vacantly around
until his glance rested upon the kneeling Lord Chancellor.
Instantly his face flushed with wrath—

"What, thou here yet! &#160;By the glory of God, an' thou
gettest not about that traitor's business, thy mitre shall have
holiday the morrow for lack of a head to grace withal!"

The trembling Chancellor answered—

"Good your Majesty, I cry you mercy! &#160;I but waited for the
Seal."

"Man, hast lost thy wits? &#160;The small Seal which aforetime I
was wont to take with me abroad lieth in my treasury. &#160;And,
since the Great Seal hath flown away, shall not it suffice?
&#160;Hast lost thy wits? &#160;Begone! &#160;And hark ye—come no
more till thou do bring his head."

The poor Chancellor was not long in removing himself from this
dangerous vicinity; nor did the commission waste time in giving the
royal assent to the work of the slavish Parliament, and appointing
the morrow for the beheading of the premier peer of England, the
luckless Duke of Norfolk.
