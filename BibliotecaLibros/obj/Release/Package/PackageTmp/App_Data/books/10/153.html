<br/>The tide was turning very fast now, very fast indeed—but in the<br/>wrong direction; it was leaving poor Tom Canty stranded on the<br/>throne, and sweeping the other out to sea. &#160;The Lord Protector<br/>communed with himself—shook his head—the thought forced itself upon<br/>him, "It is perilous to the State and to us all, to entertain so<br/>fateful a riddle as this; it could divide the nation and undermine<br/>the throne." &#160;He turned and said—<br/><br/>"Sir Thomas, arrest this—No, hold!" &#160;His face lighted, and<br/>he confronted the ragged candidate with this question—<br/><br/>"Where lieth the Great Seal? &#160;Answer me this truly, and the<br/>riddle is unriddled; for only he that was Prince of Wales CAN so<br/>answer! On so trivial a thing hang a throne and a dynasty!"<br/><br/>It was a lucky thought, a happy thought. &#160;That it was so<br/>considered by the great officials was manifested by the silent<br/>applause that shot from eye to eye around their circle in the form<br/>of bright approving glances. Yes, none but the true prince could<br/>dissolve the stubborn mystery of the vanished Great Seal—this<br/>forlorn little impostor had been taught his lesson well, but here<br/>his teachings must fail, for his teacher himself could not answer<br/>THAT question—ah, very good, very good indeed; now we shall be rid<br/>of this troublesome and perilous business in short order! And so<br/>they nodded invisibly and smiled inwardly with satisfaction, and<br/>looked to see this foolish lad stricken with a palsy of guilty<br/>confusion. How surprised they were, then, to see nothing of the<br/>sort happen—how they marvelled to hear him answer up promptly, in a<br/>confident and untroubled voice, and say—<br/><br/>"There is nought in this riddle that is difficult." &#160;Then,<br/>without so much as a by-your-leave to anybody, he turned and gave<br/>this command, with the easy manner of one accustomed to doing such<br/>things: "My Lord St. John, go you to my private cabinet in the<br/>palace—for none knoweth the place better than you—and, close down<br/>to the floor, in the left corner remotest from the door that opens<br/>from the ante-chamber, you shall find in the wall a brazen<br/>nail-head; press upon it and a little jewel-closet will fly open<br/>which not even you do know of—no, nor any soul else in all the<br/>world but me and the trusty artisan that did contrive it for me.<br/>The first thing that falleth under your eye will be the Great<br/>Seal—fetch it hither."<br/><br/>All the company wondered at this speech, and wondered still more<br/>to see the little mendicant pick out this peer without hesitancy or<br/>apparent fear of mistake, and call him by name with such a placidly<br/>convincing air of having known him all his life. &#160;The peer was<br/>almost surprised into obeying. &#160;He even made a movement as if<br/>to go, but quickly recovered his tranquil attitude and confessed<br/>his blunder with a blush. &#160;Tom Canty turned upon him and said,<br/>sharply—<br/><br/>"Why dost thou hesitate? &#160;Hast not heard the King's<br/>command? &#160;Go!"<br/><br/>The Lord St. John made a deep obeisance—and it was observed that<br/>it was a significantly cautious and non-committal one, it not being<br/>delivered at either of the kings, but at the neutral ground about<br/>half-way between the two—and took his leave.<br/><br/>Now began a movement of the gorgeous particles of that official<br/>group which was slow, scarcely perceptible, and yet steady and<br/>persistent—a movement such as is observed in a kaleidoscope that is<br/>turned slowly, whereby the components of one splendid cluster fall<br/>away and join themselves to another—a movement which, little by<br/>little, in the present case, dissolved the glittering crowd that<br/>stood about Tom Canty and clustered it together again in the<br/>neighbourhood of the new-comer. &#160;Tom Canty stood almost alone.<br/>Now ensued a brief season of deep suspense and waiting—during which<br/>even the few faint hearts still remaining near Tom Canty gradually<br/>scraped together courage enough to glide, one by one, over to the<br/>majority. &#160;So at last Tom Canty, in his royal robes and<br/>jewels, stood wholly alone and isolated from the world, a<br/>conspicuous figure, occupying an eloquent vacancy.<br/><br/>Now the Lord St. John was seen returning. &#160;As he advanced<br/>up the mid-aisle the interest was so intense that the low murmur of<br/>conversation in the great assemblage died out and was succeeded by<br/>a profound hush, a breathless stillness, through which his<br/>footfalls pulsed with a dull and distant sound. &#160;Every eye was<br/>fastened upon him as he moved along. &#160;He reached the platform,<br/>paused a moment, then moved toward Tom Canty with a deep obeisance,<br/>and said—<br/><br/>
