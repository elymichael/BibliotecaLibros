Soon there was a general buzz along the corridors, of "The
prince! See, the prince comes!"

Poor Tom came slowly walking past the low-bowing groups, trying
to bow in return, and meekly gazing upon his strange surroundings
with bewildered and pathetic eyes. &#160;Great nobles walked upon
each side of him, making him lean upon them, and so steady his
steps. Behind him followed the court-physicians and some
servants.

Presently Tom found himself in a noble apartment of the palace
and heard the door close behind him. &#160;Around him stood those
who had come with him. Before him, at a little distance, reclined a
very large and very fat man, with a wide, pulpy face, and a stern
expression. &#160;His large head was very grey; and his whiskers,
which he wore only around his face, like a frame, were grey also.
&#160;His clothing was of rich stuff, but old, and slightly frayed
in places. &#160;One of his swollen legs had a pillow under it, and
was wrapped in bandages. &#160;There was silence now; and there was
no head there but was bent in reverence, except this man's.
&#160;This stern-countenanced invalid was the dread Henry VIII.
&#160;He said—and his face grew gentle as he began to speak—

"How now, my lord Edward, my prince? &#160;Hast been minded to
cozen me, the good King thy father, who loveth thee, and kindly
useth thee, with a sorry jest?"

Poor Tom was listening, as well as his dazed faculties would let
him, to the beginning of this speech; but when the words 'me, the
good King' fell upon his ear, his face blanched, and he dropped as
instantly upon his knees as if a shot had brought him there.
Lifting up his hands, he exclaimed—

"Thou the KING? &#160;Then am I undone indeed!"

This speech seemed to stun the King. &#160;His eyes wandered
from face to face aimlessly, then rested, bewildered, upon the boy
before him. &#160;Then he said in a tone of deep
disappointment—

"Alack, I had believed the rumour disproportioned to the truth;
but I fear me 'tis not so." &#160;He breathed a heavy sigh, and
said in a gentle voice, "Come to thy father, child: &#160;thou art
not well."

Tom was assisted to his feet, and approached the Majesty of
England, humble and trembling. &#160;The King took the frightened
face between his hands, and gazed earnestly and lovingly into it
awhile, as if seeking some grateful sign of returning reason there,
then pressed the curly head against his breast, and patted it
tenderly. &#160;Presently he said—

"Dost not know thy father, child? &#160;Break not mine old
heart; say thou know'st me. &#160;Thou DOST know me, dost thou
not?"

"Yea: &#160;thou art my dread lord the King, whom God
preserve!"
