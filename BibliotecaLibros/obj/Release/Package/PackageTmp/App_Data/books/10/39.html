<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>9<br/>The river pageant<br/><br/><br/>At nine in the evening the whole vast river-front of the palace<br/>was blazing with light. &#160;The river itself, as far as the eye<br/>could reach citywards, was so thickly covered with watermen's boats<br/>and with pleasure-barges, all fringed with coloured lanterns, and<br/>gently agitated by the waves, that it resembled a glowing and<br/>limitless garden of flowers stirred to soft motion by summer winds.<br/>&#160;The grand terrace of stone steps leading down to the water,<br/>spacious enough to mass the army of a German principality upon, was<br/>a picture to see, with its ranks of royal halberdiers in polished<br/>armour, and its troops of brilliantly costumed servitors flitting<br/>up and down, and to and fro, in the hurry of preparation.<br/><br/>Presently a command was given, and immediately all living<br/>creatures vanished from the steps. &#160;Now the air was heavy with<br/>the hush of suspense and expectancy. &#160;As far as one's vision<br/>could carry, he might see the myriads of people in the boats rise<br/>up, and shade their eyes from the glare of lanterns and torches,<br/>and gaze toward the palace.<br/><br/>A file of forty or fifty state barges drew up to the steps.<br/>&#160;They were richly gilt, and their lofty prows and sterns were<br/>elaborately carved. Some of them were decorated with banners and<br/>streamers; some with cloth-of-gold and arras embroidered with<br/>coats-of-arms; others with silken flags that had numberless little<br/>silver bells fastened to them, which shook out tiny showers of<br/>joyous music whenever the breezes fluttered them; others of yet<br/>higher pretensions, since they belonged to nobles in the prince's<br/>immediate service, had their sides picturesquely fenced with<br/>shields gorgeously emblazoned with armorial bearings. &#160;Each<br/>state barge was towed by a tender. &#160;Besides the rowers, these<br/>tenders carried each a number of men-at-arms in glossy helmet and<br/>breastplate, and a company of musicians.<br/><br/>The advance-guard of the expected procession now appeared in the<br/>great gateway, a troop of halberdiers. &#160;'They were dressed in<br/>striped hose of black and tawny, velvet caps graced at the sides<br/>with silver roses, and doublets of murrey and blue cloth,<br/>embroidered on the front and back with the three feathers, the<br/>prince's blazon, woven in gold. &#160;Their halberd staves were<br/>covered with crimson velvet, fastened with gilt nails, and<br/>ornamented with gold tassels. &#160;Filing off on the right and<br/>left, they formed two long lines, extending from the gateway of the<br/>palace to the water's edge. &#160;A thick rayed cloth or carpet was<br/>then unfolded, and laid down between them by attendants in the<br/>gold-and-crimson liveries of the prince. &#160;This done, a<br/>flourish of trumpets resounded from within. &#160;A lively prelude<br/>arose from the musicians on the water; and two ushers with white<br/>wands marched with a slow and stately pace from the portal.<br/>&#160;They were followed by an officer bearing the civic mace,<br/>after whom came another carrying the city's sword; then several<br/>sergeants of the city guard, in their full accoutrements, and with<br/>badges on their sleeves; then the Garter King-at-arms, in his<br/>tabard; then several Knights of the Bath, each with a white lace on<br/>his sleeve; then their esquires; then the judges, in their robes of<br/>scarlet and coifs; then the Lord High Chancellor of England, in a<br/>robe of scarlet, open before, and purfled with minever; then a<br/>deputation of aldermen, in their scarlet cloaks; and then the heads<br/>of the different civic companies, in their robes of state. Now came<br/>twelve French gentlemen, in splendid habiliments, consisting of<br/>pourpoints of white damask barred with gold, short mantles of<br/>crimson velvet lined with violet taffeta, and carnation coloured<br/>hauts-de-chausses, and took their way down the steps. &#160;They<br/>were of the suite of the French ambassador, and were followed by<br/>twelve cavaliers of the suite of the Spanish ambassador, clothed in<br/>black velvet, unrelieved by any ornament. &#160;Following these<br/>came several great English nobles with their attendants.'<br/><br/>There was a flourish of trumpets within; and the Prince's uncle,<br/>the future great Duke of Somerset, emerged from the gateway,<br/>arrayed in a 'doublet of black cloth-of-gold, and a cloak of<br/>crimson satin flowered with gold, and ribanded with nets of<br/>silver.' &#160;He turned, doffed his plumed cap, bent his body in a<br/>low reverence, and began to step backward, bowing at each step.<br/>&#160;A prolonged trumpet-blast followed, and a proclamation, "Way<br/>for the high and mighty the Lord Edward, Prince of Wales!"<br/>&#160;High aloft on the palace walls a long line of red tongues of<br/>flame leapt forth with a thunder-crash; the massed world on the<br/>river burst into a mighty roar of welcome; and Tom Canty, the cause<br/>and hero of it all, stepped into view and slightly bowed his<br/>princely head.<br/><br/>He was 'magnificently habited in a doublet of white satin, with<br/>a front-piece of purple cloth-of-tissue, powdered with diamonds,<br/>and edged with ermine. &#160;Over this he wore a mantle of white<br/>cloth-of-gold, pounced with the triple-feathered crest, lined with<br/>blue satin, set with pearls and precious stones, and fastened with<br/>a clasp of brilliants. &#160;About his neck hung the order of the<br/>Garter, and several princely foreign orders;' and wherever light<br/>fell upon him jewels responded with a blinding flash. &#160;O Tom<br/>Canty, born in a hovel, bred in the gutters of London, familiar<br/>with rags and dirt and misery, what a spectacle is this!<br/><br/><br/>
