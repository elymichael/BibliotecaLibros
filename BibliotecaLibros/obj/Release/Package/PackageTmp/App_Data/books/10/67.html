<br/>"Whip THEE!" said Tom, astonished out of his presence of mind.<br/>"Why should he whip THEE for faults of mine?"<br/><br/>"Ah, your Grace forgetteth again. &#160;He always scourgeth me<br/>when thou dost fail in thy lessons."<br/><br/>"True, true—I had forgot. &#160;Thou teachest me in private—then<br/>if I fail, he argueth that thy office was lamely done, and—"<br/><br/>"Oh, my liege, what words are these? &#160;I, the humblest of<br/>thy servants, presume to teach THEE?"<br/><br/>"Then where is thy blame? &#160;What riddle is this? &#160;Am I<br/>in truth gone mad, or is it thou? &#160;Explain—speak out."<br/><br/>"But, good your Majesty, there's nought that needeth<br/>simplifying.—None may visit the sacred person of the Prince of<br/>Wales with blows; wherefore, when he faulteth, 'tis I that take<br/>them; and meet it is and right, for that it is mine office and my<br/>livelihood."<br/>[5]<br/><br/>Tom stared at the tranquil boy, observing to himself, "Lo, it is<br/>a wonderful thing,—a most strange and curious trade; I marvel they<br/>have not hired a boy to take my combings and my dressings for<br/>me—would heaven they would!—an' they will do this thing, I will<br/>take my lashings in mine own person, giving God thanks for the<br/>change." Then he said aloud—<br/><br/>"And hast thou been beaten, poor friend, according to the<br/>promise?"<br/><br/>"No, good your Majesty, my punishment was appointed for this<br/>day, and peradventure it may be annulled, as unbefitting the season<br/>of mourning that is come upon us; I know not, and so have made bold<br/>to come hither and remind your Grace about your gracious promise to<br/>intercede in my behalf—"<br/><br/>"With the master? &#160;To save thee thy whipping?"<br/>
