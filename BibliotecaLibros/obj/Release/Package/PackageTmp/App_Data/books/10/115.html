The justice maintained his judicial composure, and simply<br/>said—<br/><br/>"Doubtless it is allowable to revise the value, since it is not<br/>yet writ upon the record."<br/><br/>"Then in God's name call the pig eightpence, and heaven bless<br/>the day that freed my conscience of this awesome thing!"<br/><br/>Miles Hendon forgot all decorum in his delight; and surprised<br/>the King and wounded his dignity, by throwing his arms around him<br/>and hugging him. The woman made her grateful adieux and started<br/>away with her pig; and when the constable opened the door for her,<br/>he followed her out into the narrow hall. &#160;The justice<br/>proceeded to write in his record book. &#160;Hendon, always alert,<br/>thought he would like to know why the officer followed the woman<br/>out; so he slipped softly into the dusky hall and listened.<br/>&#160;He heard a conversation to this effect—<br/><br/>"It is a fat pig, and promises good eating; I will buy it of<br/>thee; here is the eightpence."<br/><br/>"Eightpence, indeed! &#160;Thou'lt do no such thing. &#160;It<br/>cost me three shillings and eightpence, good honest coin of the<br/>last reign, that old Harry that's just dead ne'er touched or<br/>tampered with. &#160;A fig for thy eightpence!"<br/><br/>"Stands the wind in that quarter? &#160;Thou wast under oath,<br/>and so swore falsely when thou saidst the value was but eightpence.<br/>&#160;Come straightway back with me before his worship, and answer<br/>for the crime!—and then the lad will hang."<br/><br/>"There, there, dear heart, say no more, I am content. &#160;Give<br/>me the eightpence, and hold thy peace about the matter."<br/><br/>The woman went off crying: &#160;Hendon slipped back into the<br/>court room, and the constable presently followed, after hiding his<br/>prize in some convenient place. &#160;The justice wrote a while<br/>longer, then read the King a wise and kindly lecture, and sentenced<br/>him to a short imprisonment in the common jail, to be followed by a<br/>public flogging. &#160;The astounded King opened his mouth, and was<br/>probably going to order the good judge to be beheaded on the spot;<br/>but he caught a warning sign from Hendon, and succeeded in closing<br/>his mouth again before he lost anything out of it. Hendon took him<br/>by the hand, now, made reverence to the justice, and the two<br/>departed in the wake of the constable toward the jail. &#160;The<br/>moment the street was reached, the inflamed monarch halted,<br/>snatched away his hand, and exclaimed—<br/><br/>"Idiot, dost imagine I will enter a common jail ALIVE?"<br/><br/>Hendon bent down and said, somewhat sharply—<br/>
