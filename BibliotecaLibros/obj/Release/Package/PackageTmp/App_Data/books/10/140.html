<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>28<br/>The sacrifice<br/><br/><br/>Meantime Miles was growing sufficiently tired of confinement and<br/>inaction. &#160;But now his trial came on, to his great<br/>gratification, and he thought he could welcome any sentence<br/>provided a further imprisonment should not be a part of it.<br/>&#160;But he was mistaken about that. &#160;He was in a fine fury<br/>when he found himself described as a 'sturdy vagabond' and<br/>sentenced to sit two hours in the stocks for bearing that character<br/>and for assaulting the master of Hendon Hall. &#160;His pretensions<br/>as to brothership with his prosecutor, and rightful heirship to the<br/>Hendon honours and estates, were left contemptuously unnoticed, as<br/>being not even worth examination.<br/><br/>He raged and threatened on his way to punishment, but it did no<br/>good; he was snatched roughly along by the officers, and got an<br/>occasional cuff, besides, for his irreverent conduct.<br/><br/>The King could not pierce through the rabble that swarmed<br/>behind; so he was obliged to follow in the rear, remote from his<br/>good friend and servant. &#160;The King had been nearly condemned<br/>to the stocks himself for being in such bad company, but had been<br/>let off with a lecture and a warning, in consideration of his<br/>youth. &#160;When the crowd at last halted, he flitted feverishly<br/>from point to point around its outer rim, hunting a place to get<br/>through; and at last, after a deal of difficulty and delay,<br/>succeeded. &#160;There sat his poor henchman in the degrading<br/>stocks, the sport and butt of a dirty mob—he, the body servant of<br/>the King of England! &#160;Edward had heard the sentence<br/>pronounced, but he had not realised the half that it meant.<br/>&#160;His anger began to rise as the sense of this new indignity<br/>which had been put upon him sank home; it jumped to summer heat,<br/>the next moment, when he saw an egg sail through the air and crush<br/>itself against Hendon's cheek, and heard the crowd roar its<br/>enjoyment of the episode. &#160;He sprang across the open circle<br/>and confronted the officer in charge, crying—<br/><br/>"For shame! &#160;This is my servant—set him free! &#160;I am<br/>the—"<br/><br/>"Oh, peace!" exclaimed Hendon, in a panic, "thou'lt destroy<br/>thyself. Mind him not, officer, he is mad."<br/><br/>"Give thyself no trouble as to the matter of minding him, good<br/>man, I have small mind to mind him; but as to teaching him<br/>somewhat, to that I am well inclined." &#160;He turned to a<br/>subordinate and said, "Give the little fool a taste or two of the<br/>lash, to mend his manners."<br/><br/>"Half a dozen will better serve his turn," suggested Sir Hugh,<br/>who had ridden up, a moment before, to take a passing glance at the<br/>proceedings.<br/>
