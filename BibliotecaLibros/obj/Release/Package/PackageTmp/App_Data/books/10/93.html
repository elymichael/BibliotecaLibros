"Have done with this folly—you weary me!"<br/><br/>Hugo replied, with temper—<br/><br/>"Now harkee, mate; you will not beg, you will not rob; so be it.<br/>But I will tell you what you WILL do. &#160;You will play decoy<br/>whilst _I_ beg. Refuse, an' you think you may venture!"<br/><br/>The King was about to reply contemptuously, when Hugo said,<br/>interrupting—<br/><br/>"Peace! &#160;Here comes one with a kindly face. &#160;Now will<br/>I fall down in a fit. &#160;When the stranger runs to me, set you<br/>up a wail, and fall upon your knees, seeming to weep; then cry out<br/>as all the devils of misery were in your belly, and say, 'Oh, sir,<br/>it is my poor afflicted brother, and we be friendless; o' God's<br/>name cast through your merciful eyes one pitiful look upon a sick,<br/>forsaken, and most miserable wretch; bestow one little penny out of<br/>thy riches upon one smitten of God and ready to perish!'—and mind<br/>you, keep you ON wailing, and abate not till we bilk him of his<br/>penny, else shall you rue it."<br/><br/>Then immediately Hugo began to moan, and groan, and roll his<br/>eyes, and reel and totter about; and when the stranger was close at<br/>hand, down he sprawled before him, with a shriek, and began to<br/>writhe and wallow in the dirt, in seeming agony.<br/><br/>"O, dear, O dear!" cried the benevolent stranger, "O poor soul,<br/>poor soul, how he doth suffer! &#160;There—let me help thee<br/>up."<br/><br/>"O noble sir, forbear, and God love you for a princely<br/>gentleman—but it giveth me cruel pain to touch me when I am taken<br/>so. &#160;My brother there will tell your worship how I am racked<br/>with anguish when these fits be upon me. &#160;A penny, dear sir, a<br/>penny, to buy a little food; then leave me to my sorrows."<br/><br/>"A penny! thou shalt have three, thou hapless creature,"—and he<br/>fumbled in his pocket with nervous haste and got them out. "There,<br/>poor lad, take them and most welcome. &#160;Now come hither, my<br/>boy, and help me carry thy stricken brother to yon house,<br/>where—"<br/><br/>"I am not his brother," said the King, interrupting.<br/><br/>"What! not his brother?"<br/>
