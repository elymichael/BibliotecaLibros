"Thy fears stay thee. &#160;Be of good heart, thou shalt suffer
no harm. &#160;Make a storm—it mattereth not how small a one—I
require nought great or harmful, but indeed prefer the opposite—do
this and thy life is spared—thou shalt go out free, with thy child,
bearing the King's pardon, and safe from hurt or malice from any in
the realm."

The woman prostrated herself, and protested, with tears, that
she had no power to do the miracle, else she would gladly win her
child's life alone, and be content to lose her own, if by obedience
to the King's command so precious a grace might be acquired.

Tom urged—the woman still adhered to her declarations.
&#160;Finally he said—

"I think the woman hath said true. &#160;An' MY mother were in
her place and gifted with the devil's functions, she had not stayed
a moment to call her storms and lay the whole land in ruins, if the
saving of my forfeit life were the price she got! &#160;It is
argument that other mothers are made in like mould. &#160;Thou art
free, goodwife—thou and thy child—for I do think thee innocent.
&#160;NOW thou'st nought to fear, being pardoned—pull off thy
stockings!—an' thou canst make me a storm, thou shalt be rich!"

The redeemed creature was loud in her gratitude, and proceeded
to obey, whilst Tom looked on with eager expectancy, a little
marred by apprehension; the courtiers at the same time manifesting
decided discomfort and uneasiness. &#160;The woman stripped her own
feet and her little girl's also, and plainly did her best to reward
the King's generosity with an earthquake, but it was all a failure
and a disappointment. &#160;Tom sighed, and said—

"There, good soul, trouble thyself no further, thy power is
departed out of thee. &#160;Go thy way in peace; and if it return
to thee at any time, forget me not, but fetch me a storm."
