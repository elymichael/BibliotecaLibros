<br/>"How dar'st thou use a poor lad like that? &#160;How dar'st thou<br/>use the King my father's meanest subject so? &#160;Open the gates,<br/>and let him in!"<br/><br/>You should have seen that fickle crowd snatch off their hats<br/>then. You should have heard them cheer, and shout, "Long live the<br/>Prince of Wales!"<br/><br/>The soldiers presented arms with their halberds, opened the<br/>gates, and presented again as the little Prince of Poverty passed<br/>in, in his fluttering rags, to join hands with the Prince of<br/>Limitless Plenty.<br/><br/>Edward Tudor said—<br/><br/>"Thou lookest tired and hungry: &#160;thou'st been treated ill.<br/>&#160;Come with me."<br/><br/>Half a dozen attendants sprang forward to—I don't know what;<br/>interfere, no doubt. &#160;But they were waved aside with a right<br/>royal gesture, and they stopped stock still where they were, like<br/>so many statues. &#160;Edward took Tom to a rich apartment in the<br/>palace, which he called his cabinet. &#160;By his command a repast<br/>was brought such as Tom had never encountered before except in<br/>books. &#160;The prince, with princely delicacy and breeding, sent<br/>away the servants, so that his humble guest might not be<br/>embarrassed by their critical presence; then he sat near by, and<br/>asked questions while Tom ate.<br/><br/>"What is thy name, lad?"<br/><br/>"Tom Canty, an' it please thee, sir."<br/><br/>"'Tis an odd one. &#160;Where dost live?"<br/><br/>"In the city, please thee, sir. &#160;Offal Court, out of<br/>Pudding Lane."<br/><br/>
