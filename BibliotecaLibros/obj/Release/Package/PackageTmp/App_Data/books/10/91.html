<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>18<br/>The Prince with the tramps<br/><br/><br/>The troop of vagabonds turned out at early dawn, and set forward<br/>on their march. &#160;There was a lowering sky overhead, sloppy<br/>ground under foot, and a winter chill in the air. &#160;All gaiety<br/>was gone from the company; some were sullen and silent, some were<br/>irritable and petulant, none were gentle-humoured, all were<br/>thirsty.<br/><br/>The Ruffler put 'Jack' in Hugo's charge, with some brief<br/>instructions, and commanded John Canty to keep away from him and<br/>let him alone; he also warned Hugo not to be too rough with the<br/>lad.<br/><br/>After a while the weather grew milder, and the clouds lifted<br/>somewhat. The troop ceased to shiver, and their spirits began to<br/>improve. &#160;They grew more and more cheerful, and finally began<br/>to chaff each other and insult passengers along the highway.<br/>&#160;This showed that they were awaking to an appreciation of life<br/>and its joys once more. &#160;The dread in which their sort was<br/>held was apparent in the fact that everybody gave them the road,<br/>and took their ribald insolences meekly, without venturing to talk<br/>back. They snatched linen from the hedges, occasionally in full<br/>view of the owners, who made no protest, but only seemed grateful<br/>that they did not take the hedges, too.<br/><br/>By-and-by they invaded a small farmhouse and made themselves at<br/>home while the trembling farmer and his people swept the larder<br/>clean to furnish a breakfast for them. &#160;They chucked the<br/>housewife and her daughters under the chin whilst receiving the<br/>food from their hands, and made coarse jests about them,<br/>accompanied with insulting epithets and bursts of horse-laughter.<br/>&#160;They threw bones and vegetables at the farmer and his sons,<br/>kept them dodging all the time, and applauded uproariously when a<br/>good hit was made. They ended by buttering the head of one of the<br/>daughters who resented some of their familiarities. &#160;When they<br/>took their leave they threatened to come back and burn the house<br/>over the heads of the family if any report of their doings got to<br/>the ears of the authorities.<br/><br/>About noon, after a long and weary tramp, the gang came to a<br/>halt behind a hedge on the outskirts of a considerable village.<br/>&#160;An hour was allowed for rest, then the crew scattered<br/>themselves abroad to enter the village at different points to ply<br/>their various trades—'Jack' was sent with Hugo. &#160;They wandered<br/>hither and thither for some time, Hugo watching for opportunities<br/>to do a stroke of business, but finding none—so he finally<br/>said—<br/><br/>"I see nought to steal; it is a paltry place. &#160;Wherefore we<br/>will beg."<br/><br/>"WE, forsooth! &#160;Follow thy trade—it befits thee. &#160;But<br/>_I_ will not beg."<br/>
