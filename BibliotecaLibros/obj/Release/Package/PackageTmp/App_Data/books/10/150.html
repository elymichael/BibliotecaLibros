<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>32<br/>Coronation Day<br/><br/><br/>Let us go backward a few hours, and place ourselves in<br/>Westminster Abbey, at four o'clock in the morning of this memorable<br/>Coronation Day. &#160;We are not without company; for although it<br/>is still night, we find the torch-lighted galleries already filling<br/>up with people who are well content to sit still and wait seven or<br/>eight hours till the time shall come for them to see what they may<br/>not hope to see twice in their lives—the coronation of a King.<br/>&#160;Yes, London and Westminster have been astir ever since the<br/>warning guns boomed at three o'clock, and already crowds of<br/>untitled rich folk who have bought the privilege of trying to find<br/>sitting-room in the galleries are flocking in at the entrances<br/>reserved for their sort.<br/><br/>The hours drag along tediously enough. &#160;All stir has ceased<br/>for some time, for every gallery has long ago been packed. &#160;We<br/>may sit, now, and look and think at our leisure. &#160;We have<br/>glimpses, here and there and yonder, through the dim cathedral<br/>twilight, of portions of many galleries and balconies, wedged full<br/>with other people, the other portions of these galleries and<br/>balconies being cut off from sight by intervening pillars and<br/>architectural projections. &#160;We have in view the whole of the<br/>great north transept—empty, and waiting for England's privileged<br/>ones. &#160;We see also the ample area or platform, carpeted with<br/>rich stuffs, whereon the throne stands. &#160;The throne occupies<br/>the centre of the platform, and is raised above it upon an<br/>elevation of four steps. Within the seat of the throne is enclosed<br/>a rough flat rock—the stone of Scone—which many generations of<br/>Scottish kings sat on to be crowned, and so it in time became holy<br/>enough to answer a like purpose for English monarchs. &#160;Both<br/>the throne and its footstool are covered with cloth of gold.<br/><br/>Stillness reigns, the torches blink dully, the time drags<br/>heavily. But at last the lagging daylight asserts itself, the<br/>torches are extinguished, and a mellow radiance suffuses the great<br/>spaces. All features of the noble building are distinct now, but<br/>soft and dreamy, for the sun is lightly veiled with clouds.<br/><br/>At seven o'clock the first break in the drowsy monotony occurs;<br/>for on the stroke of this hour the first peeress enters the<br/>transept, clothed like Solomon for splendour, and is conducted to<br/>her appointed place by an official clad in satins and velvets,<br/>whilst a duplicate of him gathers up the lady's long train, follows<br/>after, and, when the lady is seated, arranges the train across her<br/>lap for her. &#160;He then places her footstool according to her<br/>desire, after which he puts her coronet where it will be convenient<br/>to her hand when the time for the simultaneous coroneting of the<br/>nobles shall arrive.<br/><br/>By this time the peeresses are flowing in in a glittering<br/>stream, and the satin-clad officials are flitting and glinting<br/>everywhere, seating them and making them comfortable. &#160;The<br/>scene is animated enough now. &#160;There is stir and life, and<br/>shifting colour everywhere. &#160;After a time, quiet reigns again;<br/>for the peeresses are all come and are all in their places, a solid<br/>acre or such a matter, of human flowers, resplendent in variegated<br/>colours, and frosted like a Milky Way with diamonds. &#160;There<br/>are all ages here: brown, wrinkled, white-haired dowagers who are<br/>able to go back, and still back, down the stream of time, and<br/>recall the crowning of Richard III. and the troublous days of that<br/>old forgotten age; and there are handsome middle-aged dames; and<br/>lovely and gracious young matrons; and gentle and beautiful young<br/>girls, with beaming eyes and fresh complexions, who may possibly<br/>put on their jewelled coronets awkwardly when the great time comes;<br/>for the matter will be new to them, and their excitement will be a<br/>sore hindrance. Still, this may not happen, for the hair of all<br/>these ladies has been arranged with a special view to the swift and<br/>successful lodging of the crown in its place when the signal<br/>comes.<br/><br/>We have seen that this massed array of peeresses is sown thick<br/>with diamonds, and we also see that it is a marvellous<br/>spectacle—but now we are about to be astonished in earnest.<br/>&#160;About nine, the clouds suddenly break away and a shaft of<br/>sunshine cleaves the mellow atmosphere, and drifts slowly along the<br/>ranks of ladies; and every rank it touches flames into a dazzling<br/>splendour of many-coloured fires, and we tingle to our finger-tips<br/>with the electric thrill that is shot through us by the surprise<br/>and the beauty of the spectacle! &#160;Presently a special envoy<br/>from some distant corner of the Orient, marching with the general<br/>body of foreign ambassadors, crosses this bar of sunshine, and we<br/>catch our breath, the glory that streams and flashes and palpitates<br/>about him is so overpowering; for he is crusted from head to heel<br/>with gems, and his slightest movement showers a dancing radiance<br/>all around him.<br/><br/>Let us change the tense for convenience. &#160;The time drifted<br/>along—one hour—two hours—two hours and a half; then the deep<br/>booming of artillery told that the King and his grand procession<br/>had arrived at last; so the waiting multitude rejoiced. &#160;All<br/>knew that a further delay must follow, for the King must be<br/>prepared and robed for the solemn ceremony; but this delay would be<br/>pleasantly occupied by the assembling of the peers of the realm in<br/>their stately robes. &#160;These were conducted ceremoniously to<br/>their seats, and their coronets placed conveniently at hand; and<br/>meanwhile the multitude in the galleries were alive with interest,<br/>for most of them were beholding for the first time, dukes, earls,<br/>and barons, whose names had been historical for five hundred years.<br/>&#160;When all were finally seated, the spectacle from the<br/>galleries and all coigns of vantage was complete; a gorgeous one to<br/>look upon and to remember.<br/>
