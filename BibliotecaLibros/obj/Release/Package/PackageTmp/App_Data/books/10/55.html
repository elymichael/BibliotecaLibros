While the King ate, the rigour of his royal dignity relaxed a<br/>little, and with his growing contentment came a desire to talk. He<br/>said—"I think thou callest thyself Miles Hendon, if I heard thee<br/>aright?"<br/><br/>"Yes, Sire," Miles replied; then observed to himself, "If I MUST<br/>humour the poor lad's madness, I must 'Sire' him, I must 'Majesty'<br/>him, I must not go by halves, I must stick at nothing that<br/>belongeth to the part I play, else shall I play it ill and work<br/>evil to this charitable and kindly cause."<br/><br/>The King warmed his heart with a second glass of wine, and<br/>said—"I would know thee—tell me thy story. &#160;Thou hast a<br/>gallant way with thee, and a noble—art nobly born?"<br/><br/>"We are of the tail of the nobility, good your Majesty. &#160;My<br/>father is a baronet—one of the smaller lords by knight service—Sir<br/>Richard Hendon of Hendon Hall, by Monk's Holm in Kent."<br/><br/>"The name has escaped my memory. &#160;Go on—tell me thy<br/>story."<br/><br/>"'Tis not much, your Majesty, yet perchance it may beguile a<br/>short half-hour for want of a better. &#160;My father, Sir Richard,<br/>is very rich, and of a most generous nature. &#160;My mother died<br/>whilst I was yet a boy. &#160;I have two brothers: &#160;Arthur, my<br/>elder, with a soul like to his father's; and Hugh, younger than I,<br/>a mean spirit, covetous, treacherous, vicious, underhanded—a<br/>reptile. &#160;Such was he from the cradle; such was he ten years<br/>past, when I last saw him—a ripe rascal at nineteen, I being twenty<br/>then, and Arthur twenty-two. &#160;There is none other of us but<br/>the Lady Edith, my cousin—she was sixteen then—beautiful, gentle,<br/>good, the daughter of an earl, the last of her race, heiress of a<br/>great fortune and a lapsed title. &#160;My father was her guardian.<br/>&#160;I loved her and she loved me; but she was betrothed to Arthur<br/>from the cradle, and Sir Richard would not suffer the contract to<br/>be broken. &#160;Arthur loved another maid, and bade us be of good<br/>cheer and hold fast to the hope that delay and luck together would<br/>some day give success to our several causes. &#160;Hugh loved the<br/>Lady Edith's fortune, though in truth he said it was herself he<br/>loved—but then 'twas his way, alway, to say the one thing and mean<br/>the other. &#160;But he lost his arts upon the girl; he could<br/>deceive my father, but none else. &#160;My father loved him best of<br/>us all, and trusted and believed him; for he was the youngest<br/>child, and others hated him—these qualities being in all ages<br/>sufficient to win a parent's dearest love; and he had a smooth<br/>persuasive tongue, with an admirable gift of lying—and these be<br/>qualities which do mightily assist a blind affection to cozen<br/>itself. &#160;I was wild—in troth I might go yet farther and say<br/>VERY wild, though 'twas a wildness of an innocent sort, since it<br/>hurt none but me, brought shame to none, nor loss, nor had in it<br/>any taint of crime or baseness, or what might not beseem mine<br/>honourable degree.<br/><br/>"Yet did my brother Hugh turn these faults to good account—he<br/>seeing that our brother Arthur's health was but indifferent, and<br/>hoping the worst might work him profit were I swept out of the<br/>path—so—but 'twere a long tale, good my liege, and little worth the<br/>telling. &#160;Briefly, then, this brother did deftly magnify my<br/>faults and make them crimes; ending his base work with finding a<br/>silken ladder in mine apartments—conveyed thither by his own<br/>means—and did convince my father by this, and suborned evidence of<br/>servants and other lying knaves, that I was minded to carry off my<br/>Edith and marry with her in rank defiance of his will.<br/><br/>"Three years of banishment from home and England might make a<br/>soldier and a man of me, my father said, and teach me some degree<br/>of wisdom. &#160;I fought out my long probation in the continental<br/>wars, tasting sumptuously of hard knocks, privation, and adventure;<br/>but in my last battle I was taken captive, and during the seven<br/>years that have waxed and waned since then, a foreign dungeon hath<br/>harboured me. &#160;Through wit and courage I won to the free air<br/>at last, and fled hither straight; and am but just arrived, right<br/>poor in purse and raiment, and poorer still in knowledge of what<br/>these dull seven years have wrought at Hendon Hall, its people and<br/>belongings. &#160;So please you, sir, my meagre tale is told."<br/><br/>"Thou hast been shamefully abused!" said the little King, with a<br/>flashing eye. &#160;"But I will right thee—by the cross will I!<br/>&#160;The King hath said it."<br/><br/>Then, fired by the story of Miles's wrongs, he loosed his tongue<br/>and poured the history of his own recent misfortunes into the ears<br/>of his astonished listener. &#160;When he had finished, Miles said<br/>to himself—<br/><br/>"Lo, what an imagination he hath! &#160;Verily, this is no<br/>common mind; else, crazed or sane, it could not weave so straight<br/>and gaudy a tale as this out of the airy nothings wherewith it hath<br/>wrought this curious romaunt. Poor ruined little head, it shall not<br/>lack friend or shelter whilst I bide with the living. &#160;He<br/>shall never leave my side; he shall be my pet, my little comrade.<br/>&#160;And he shall be cured!—ay, made whole and sound—then will he<br/>make himself a name—and proud shall I be to say, 'Yes, he is mine—I<br/>took him, a homeless little ragamuffin, but I saw what was in him,<br/>and I said his name would be heard some day—behold him, observe<br/>him—was I right?'"<br/>
