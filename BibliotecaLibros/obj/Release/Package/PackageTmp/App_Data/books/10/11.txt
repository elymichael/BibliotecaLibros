"Offal Court! &#160;Truly 'tis another odd one. &#160;Hast
parents?"

"Parents have I, sir, and a grand-dam likewise that is but
indifferently precious to me, God forgive me if it be offence to
say it—also twin sisters, Nan and Bet."

"Then is thy grand-dam not over kind to thee, I take it?"

"Neither to any other is she, so please your worship. &#160;She
hath a wicked heart, and worketh evil all her days."

"Doth she mistreat thee?"

"There be times that she stayeth her hand, being asleep or
overcome with drink; but when she hath her judgment clear again,
she maketh it up to me with goodly beatings."

A fierce look came into the little prince's eyes, and he cried
out—

"What! &#160;Beatings?"

"Oh, indeed, yes, please you, sir."

"BEATINGS!—and thou so frail and little. &#160;Hark ye:
&#160;before the night come, she shall hie her to the Tower.
&#160;The King my father"—

"In sooth, you forget, sir, her low degree. &#160;The Tower is
for the great alone."
