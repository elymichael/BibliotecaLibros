"It enrageth me that a man should be hanged upon such idle,
hare-brained evidence!"

A low buzz of admiration swept through the assemblage. &#160;It
was not admiration of the decree that had been delivered by Tom,
for the propriety or expediency of pardoning a convicted poisoner
was a thing which few there would have felt justified in either
admitting or admiring—no, the admiration was for the intelligence
and spirit which Tom had displayed. &#160;Some of the low-voiced
remarks were to this effect—

"This is no mad king—he hath his wits sound."

"How sanely he put his questions—how like his former natural
self was this abrupt imperious disposal of the matter!"

"God be thanked, his infirmity is spent! &#160;This is no
weakling, but a king. &#160;He hath borne himself like to his own
father."

The air being filled with applause, Tom's ear necessarily caught
a little of it. &#160;The effect which this had upon him was to put
him greatly at his ease, and also to charge his system with very
gratifying sensations.

However, his juvenile curiosity soon rose superior to these
pleasant thoughts and feelings; he was eager to know what sort of
deadly mischief the woman and the little girl could have been
about; so, by his command, the two terrified and sobbing creatures
were brought before him.

"What is it that these have done?" he inquired of the
sheriff.

"Please your Majesty, a black crime is charged upon them, and
clearly proven; wherefore the judges have decreed, according to the
law, that they be hanged. &#160;They sold themselves to the
devil—such is their crime."

Tom shuddered. &#160;He had been taught to abhor people who did
this wicked thing. &#160;Still, he was not going to deny himself
the pleasure of feeding his curiosity for all that; so he
asked—

"Where was this done?—and when?"
