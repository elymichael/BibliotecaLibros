<br/>"Indeed? &#160;Doth it not strike you as being passing strange<br/>that the land is not filled with couriers and proclamations<br/>describing my person and making search for me? &#160;Is it no<br/>matter for commotion and distress that the Head of the State is<br/>gone; that I am vanished away and lost?"<br/><br/>"Most true, my King, I had forgot." &#160;Then Hendon sighed,<br/>and muttered to himself, "Poor ruined mind—still busy with its<br/>pathetic dream."<br/><br/>"But I have a plan that shall right us both—I will write a<br/>paper, in three tongues—Latin, Greek and English—and thou shalt<br/>haste away with it to London in the morning. &#160;Give it to none<br/>but my uncle, the Lord Hertford; when he shall see it, he will know<br/>and say I wrote it. &#160;Then he will send for me."<br/><br/>"Might it not be best, my Prince, that we wait here until I<br/>prove myself and make my rights secure to my domains? &#160;I<br/>should be so much the better able then to—"<br/><br/>The King interrupted him imperiously—<br/><br/>"Peace! &#160;What are thy paltry domains, thy trivial<br/>interests, contrasted with matters which concern the weal of a<br/>nation and the integrity of a throne?" &#160;Then, he added, in a<br/>gentle voice, as if he were sorry for his severity, "Obey, and have<br/>no fear; I will right thee, I will make thee whole—yes, more than<br/>whole. &#160;I shall remember, and requite."<br/><br/>So saying, he took the pen, and set himself to work.<br/>&#160;Hendon contemplated him lovingly a while, then said to<br/>himself—<br/><br/>"An' it were dark, I should think it WAS a king that spoke;<br/>there's no denying it, when the humour's upon on him he doth<br/>thunder and lighten like your true King; now where got he that<br/>trick? &#160;See him scribble and scratch away contentedly at his<br/>meaningless pot-hooks, fancying them to be Latin and Greek—and<br/>except my wit shall serve me with a lucky device for diverting him<br/>from his purpose, I shall be forced to pretend to post away<br/>to-morrow on this wild errand he hath invented for me."<br/><br/>The next moment Sir Miles's thoughts had gone back to the recent<br/>episode. So absorbed was he in his musings, that when the King<br/>presently handed him the paper which he had been writing, he<br/>received it and pocketed it without being conscious of the act.<br/>"How marvellous strange she acted," he muttered. &#160;"I think she<br/>knew me—and I think she did NOT know me. These opinions do<br/>conflict, I perceive it plainly; I cannot reconcile them, neither<br/>can I, by argument, dismiss either of the two, or even persuade one<br/>to outweigh the other. &#160;The matter standeth simply thus: she<br/>MUST have known my face, my figure, my voice, for how could it be<br/>otherwise? &#160;Yet she SAID she knew me not, and that is proof<br/>perfect, for she cannot lie. &#160;But stop—I think I begin to see.<br/>Peradventure he hath influenced her, commanded her, compelled her<br/>to lie. &#160;That is the solution. &#160;The riddle is unriddled.<br/>&#160;She seemed dead with fear—yes, she was under his compulsion.<br/>&#160;I will seek her; I will find her; now that he is away, she<br/>will speak her true mind. &#160;She will remember the old times<br/>when we were little playfellows together, and this will soften her<br/>heart, and she will no more betray me, but will confess me.<br/>&#160;There is no treacherous blood in her—no, she was always<br/>honest and true. &#160;She has loved me, in those old days—this is<br/>my security; for whom one has loved, one cannot betray."<br/><br/>He stepped eagerly toward the door; at that moment it opened,<br/>and the Lady Edith entered. &#160;She was very pale, but she walked<br/>with a firm step, and her carriage was full of grace and gentle<br/>dignity. Her face was as sad as before.<br/><br/>
