<br/>The prince's eyes flashed. &#160;Said he—<br/><br/>"Marry, that would not I mislike. &#160;Tell me more."<br/><br/>"We strive in races, sir, to see who of us shall be<br/>fleetest."<br/><br/>"That would I like also. &#160;Speak on."<br/><br/>"In summer, sir, we wade and swim in the canals and in the<br/>river, and each doth duck his neighbour, and splatter him with<br/>water, and dive and shout and tumble and—"<br/><br/>"'Twould be worth my father's kingdom but to enjoy it once!<br/>Prithee go on."<br/><br/>"We dance and sing about the Maypole in Cheapside; we play in<br/>the sand, each covering his neighbour up; and times we make mud<br/>pastry—oh the lovely mud, it hath not its like for delightfulness<br/>in all the world!—we do fairly wallow in the mud, sir, saving your<br/>worship's presence."<br/><br/>"Oh, prithee, say no more, 'tis glorious! &#160;If that I could<br/>but clothe me in raiment like to thine, and strip my feet, and<br/>revel in the mud once, just once, with none to rebuke me or forbid,<br/>meseemeth I could forego the crown!"<br/><br/>"And if that I could clothe me once, sweet sir, as thou art<br/>clad—just once—"<br/><br/>"Oho, would'st like it? &#160;Then so shall it be. &#160;Doff<br/>thy rags, and don these splendours, lad! &#160;It is a brief<br/>happiness, but will be not less keen for that. &#160;We will have<br/>it while we may, and change again before any come to molest."<br/><br/>
