"Only that thou be blind and dumb and paralytic whilst one may
count a hundred thousand—counting slowly," said Hendon, with the
expression of a man who asks but a reasonable favour, and that a
very little one.

"It is my destruction!" said the constable despairingly.
&#160;"Ah, be reasonable, good sir; only look at this matter, on
all its sides, and see how mere a jest it is—how manifestly and how
plainly it is so. &#160;And even if one granted it were not a jest,
it is a fault so small that e'en the grimmest penalty it could call
forth would be but a rebuke and warning from the judge's lips."

Hendon replied with a solemnity which chilled the air about
him—

"This jest of thine hath a name, in law,—wot you what it
is?"

"I knew it not! &#160;Peradventure I have been unwise. &#160;I
never dreamed it had a name—ah, sweet heaven, I thought it was
original."

"Yes, it hath a name. &#160;In the law this crime is called Non
compos mentis lex talionis sic transit gloria mundi."

"Ah, my God!"

"And the penalty is death!"

"God be merciful to me a sinner!"

"By advantage taken of one in fault, in dire peril, and at thy
mercy, thou hast seized goods worth above thirteenpence ha'penny,
paying but a trifle for the same; and this, in the eye of the law,
is constructive barratry, misprision of treason, malfeasance in
office, ad hominem expurgatis in statu quo—and the penalty is death
by the halter, without ransom, commutation, or benefit of
clergy."

"Bear me up, bear me up, sweet sir, my legs do fail me! &#160;Be
thou merciful—spare me this doom, and I will turn my back and see
nought that shall happen."
