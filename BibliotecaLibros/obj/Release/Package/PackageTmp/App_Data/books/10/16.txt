"I am the Prince of Wales, my person is sacred; and thou shalt
hang for laying thy hand upon me!"

The soldier brought his halberd to a present-arms and said
mockingly—

"I salute your gracious Highness." &#160;Then angrily—"Be off,
thou crazy rubbish!"

Here the jeering crowd closed round the poor little prince, and
hustled him far down the road, hooting him, and shouting—

"Way for his Royal Highness! &#160;Way for the Prince of
Wales!"
