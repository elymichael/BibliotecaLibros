<br/>"Belike thou'lt change thy note eftsoons. &#160;An thou would<br/>save thy neck, nothing but flight may stead thee. &#160;The man is<br/>this moment delivering up the ghost. &#160;'Tis the priest, Father<br/>Andrew!"<br/><br/>"God-a-mercy!" exclaimed Canty. &#160;He roused his family, and<br/>hoarsely commanded, "Up with ye all and fly—or bide where ye are<br/>and perish!"<br/><br/>Scarcely five minutes later the Canty household were in the<br/>street and flying for their lives. &#160;John Canty held the Prince<br/>by the wrist, and hurried him along the dark way, giving him this<br/>caution in a low voice—<br/><br/>"Mind thy tongue, thou mad fool, and speak not our name. &#160;I<br/>will choose me a new name, speedily, to throw the law's dogs off<br/>the scent. &#160;Mind thy tongue, I tell thee!"<br/><br/>He growled these words to the rest of the family—<br/><br/>"If it so chance that we be separated, let each make for London<br/>Bridge; whoso findeth himself as far as the last linen-draper's<br/>shop on the bridge, let him tarry there till the others be come,<br/>then will we flee into Southwark together."<br/><br/>At this moment the party burst suddenly out of darkness into<br/>light; and not only into light, but into the midst of a multitude<br/>of singing, dancing, and shouting people, massed together on the<br/>river frontage. There was a line of bonfires stretching as far as<br/>one could see, up and down the Thames; London Bridge was<br/>illuminated; Southwark Bridge likewise; the entire river was aglow<br/>with the flash and sheen of coloured lights; and constant<br/>explosions of fireworks filled the skies with an intricate<br/>commingling of shooting splendours and a thick rain of dazzling<br/>sparks that almost turned night into day; everywhere were crowds of<br/>revellers; all London seemed to be at large.<br/><br/>John Canty delivered himself of a furious curse and commanded a<br/>retreat; but it was too late. &#160;He and his tribe were swallowed<br/>up in that swarming hive of humanity, and hopelessly separated from<br/>each other in an instant. We are not considering that the Prince<br/>was one of his tribe; Canty still kept his grip upon him. &#160;The<br/>Prince's heart was beating high with hopes of escape, now. &#160;A<br/>burly waterman, considerably exalted with liquor, found himself<br/>rudely shoved by Canty in his efforts to plough through the crowd;<br/>he laid his great hand on Canty's shoulder and said—<br/><br/>"Nay, whither so fast, friend? &#160;Dost canker thy soul with<br/>sordid business when all that be leal men and true make<br/>holiday?"<br/><br/>"Mine affairs are mine own, they concern thee not," answered<br/>Canty, roughly; "take away thy hand and let me pass."<br/><br/>
