Tom signified assent with a gesture and a murmured word, for he<br/>was already learning, and in his simple heart was resolved to<br/>acquit himself as best he might, according to the King's<br/>command.<br/><br/>In spite of every precaution, the conversation among the young<br/>people became a little embarrassing at times. &#160;More than once,<br/>in truth, Tom was near to breaking down and confessing himself<br/>unequal to his tremendous part; but the tact of the Princess<br/>Elizabeth saved him, or a word from one or the other of the<br/>vigilant lords, thrown in apparently by chance, had the same happy<br/>effect. &#160;Once the little Lady Jane turned to Tom and dismayed<br/>him with this question,—<br/><br/>"Hast paid thy duty to the Queen's majesty to-day, my lord?"<br/><br/>Tom hesitated, looked distressed, and was about to stammer out<br/>something at hazard, when Lord St. John took the word and answered<br/>for him with the easy grace of a courtier accustomed to encounter<br/>delicate difficulties and to be ready for them—<br/><br/>"He hath indeed, madam, and she did greatly hearten him, as<br/>touching his majesty's condition; is it not so, your highness?"<br/><br/>Tom mumbled something that stood for assent, but felt that he<br/>was getting upon dangerous ground. &#160;Somewhat later it was<br/>mentioned that Tom was to study no more at present, whereupon her<br/>little ladyship exclaimed—<br/><br/>"'Tis a pity, 'tis a pity! &#160;Thou wert proceeding bravely.<br/>&#160;But bide thy time in patience: &#160;it will not be for long.<br/>&#160;Thou'lt yet be graced with learning like thy father, and make<br/>thy tongue master of as many languages as his, good my prince."<br/><br/>"My father!" cried Tom, off his guard for the moment. &#160;"I<br/>trow he cannot speak his own so that any but the swine that kennel<br/>in the styes may tell his meaning; and as for learning of any sort<br/>soever—"<br/><br/>He looked up and encountered a solemn warning in my Lord St.<br/>John's eyes.<br/><br/>He stopped, blushed, then continued low and sadly: "Ah, my<br/>malady persecuteth me again, and my mind wandereth. &#160;I meant<br/>the King's grace no irreverence."<br/><br/>"We know it, sir," said the Princess Elizabeth, taking her<br/>'brother's' hand between her two palms, respectfully but<br/>caressingly; "trouble not thyself as to that. &#160;The fault is<br/>none of thine, but thy distemper's."<br/>
