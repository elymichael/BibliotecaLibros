"Have done with this folly—you weary me!"

Hugo replied, with temper—

"Now harkee, mate; you will not beg, you will not rob; so be it.
But I will tell you what you WILL do. &#160;You will play decoy
whilst _I_ beg. Refuse, an' you think you may venture!"

The King was about to reply contemptuously, when Hugo said,
interrupting—

"Peace! &#160;Here comes one with a kindly face. &#160;Now will
I fall down in a fit. &#160;When the stranger runs to me, set you
up a wail, and fall upon your knees, seeming to weep; then cry out
as all the devils of misery were in your belly, and say, 'Oh, sir,
it is my poor afflicted brother, and we be friendless; o' God's
name cast through your merciful eyes one pitiful look upon a sick,
forsaken, and most miserable wretch; bestow one little penny out of
thy riches upon one smitten of God and ready to perish!'—and mind
you, keep you ON wailing, and abate not till we bilk him of his
penny, else shall you rue it."

Then immediately Hugo began to moan, and groan, and roll his
eyes, and reel and totter about; and when the stranger was close at
hand, down he sprawled before him, with a shriek, and began to
writhe and wallow in the dirt, in seeming agony.

"O, dear, O dear!" cried the benevolent stranger, "O poor soul,
poor soul, how he doth suffer! &#160;There—let me help thee
up."

"O noble sir, forbear, and God love you for a princely
gentleman—but it giveth me cruel pain to touch me when I am taken
so. &#160;My brother there will tell your worship how I am racked
with anguish when these fits be upon me. &#160;A penny, dear sir, a
penny, to buy a little food; then leave me to my sorrows."

"A penny! thou shalt have three, thou hapless creature,"—and he
fumbled in his pocket with nervous haste and got them out. "There,
poor lad, take them and most welcome. &#160;Now come hither, my
boy, and help me carry thy stricken brother to yon house,
where—"

"I am not his brother," said the King, interrupting.

"What! not his brother?"
