<br/>A silence ensued, undisturbed by a movement or a whisper,<br/>and all eyes were fixed upon the new-comer, who stood, with bent<br/>head and corrugated brow, groping in his memory among a thronging<br/>multitude of valueless recollections for one single little elusive<br/>fact, which, found, would seat him upon a throne—unfound, would<br/>leave him as he was, for good and all—a pauper and an outcast.<br/>&#160;Moment after moment passed—the moments built themselves into<br/>minutes—still the boy struggled silently on, and gave no sign.<br/>&#160;But at last he heaved a sigh, shook his head slowly, and<br/>said, with a trembling lip and in a despondent voice—<br/><br/>"I call the scene back—all of it—but the Seal hath no place in<br/>it." &#160;He paused, then looked up, and said with gentle dignity,<br/>"My lords and gentlemen, if ye will rob your rightful sovereign of<br/>his own for lack of this evidence which he is not able to furnish,<br/>I may not stay ye, being powerless. &#160;But—"<br/><br/>"Oh, folly, oh, madness, my King!" cried Tom Canty, in a panic,<br/>"wait!—think! &#160;Do not give up!—the cause is not lost!<br/>&#160;Nor SHALL be, neither! List to what I say—follow every word—I<br/>am going to bring that morning back again, every hap just as it<br/>happened. &#160;We talked—I told you of my sisters, Nan and Bet—ah,<br/>yes, you remember that; and about mine old grandam—and the rough<br/>games of the lads of Offal Court—yes, you remember these things<br/>also; very well, follow me still, you shall recall everything.<br/>&#160;You gave me food and drink, and did with princely courtesy<br/>send away the servants, so that my low breeding might not shame me<br/>before them—ah, yes, this also you remember."<br/><br/>As Tom checked off his details, and the other boy nodded his<br/>head in recognition of them, the great audience and the officials<br/>stared in puzzled wonderment; the tale sounded like true history,<br/>yet how could this impossible conjunction between a prince and a<br/>beggar-boy have come about? &#160;Never was a company of people so<br/>perplexed, so interested, and so stupefied, before.<br/><br/>"For a jest, my prince, we did exchange garments. &#160;Then we<br/>stood before a mirror; and so alike were we that both said it<br/>seemed as if there had been no change made—yes, you remember that.<br/>&#160;Then you noticed that the soldier had hurt my hand—look! here<br/>it is, I cannot yet even write with it, the fingers are so stiff.<br/>&#160;At this your Highness sprang up, vowing vengeance upon that<br/>soldier, and ran towards the door—you passed a table—that thing you<br/>call the Seal lay on that table—you snatched it up and looked<br/>eagerly about, as if for a place to hide it—your eye caught sight<br/>of—"<br/><br/>"There, 'tis sufficient!—and the good God be thanked!" exclaimed<br/>the ragged claimant, in a mighty excitement. &#160;"Go, my good St.<br/>John—in an arm-piece of the Milanese armour that hangs on the wall,<br/>thou'lt find the Seal!"<br/><br/>"Right, my King! right!" cried Tom Canty; "NOW the sceptre of<br/>England is thine own; and it were better for him that would dispute<br/>it that he had been born dumb! &#160;Go, my Lord St. John, give thy<br/>feet wings!"<br/><br/>The whole assemblage was on its feet now, and well-nigh out of<br/>its mind with uneasiness, apprehension, and consuming excitement.<br/>&#160;On the floor and on the platform a deafening buzz of frantic<br/>conversation burst forth, and for some time nobody knew anything or<br/>heard anything or was interested in anything but what his neighbour<br/>was shouting into his ear, or he was shouting into his neighbour's<br/>ear. &#160;Time—nobody knew how much of it—swept by unheeded and<br/>unnoted. &#160;At last a sudden hush fell upon the house, and in<br/>the same moment St. John appeared upon the platform, and held the<br/>Great Seal aloft in his hand. &#160;Then such a shout went up—<br/><br/>"Long live the true King!"<br/><br/>For five minutes the air quaked with shouts and the crash of<br/>musical instruments, and was white with a storm of waving<br/>handkerchiefs; and through it all a ragged lad, the most<br/>conspicuous figure in England, stood, flushed and happy and proud,<br/>in the centre of the spacious platform, with the great vassals of<br/>the kingdom kneeling around him.<br/><br/>
