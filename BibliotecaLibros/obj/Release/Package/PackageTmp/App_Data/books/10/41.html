<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>10<br/>The Prince in the toils<br/><br/><br/>We left John Canty dragging the rightful prince into Offal<br/>Court, with a noisy and delighted mob at his heels. &#160;There was<br/>but one person in it who offered a pleading word for the captive,<br/>and he was not heeded; he was hardly even heard, so great was the<br/>turmoil. &#160;The Prince continued to struggle for freedom, and to<br/>rage against the treatment he was suffering, until John Canty lost<br/>what little patience was left in him, and raised his oaken cudgel<br/>in a sudden fury over the Prince's head. &#160;The single pleader<br/>for the lad sprang to stop the man's arm, and the blow descended<br/>upon his own wrist. &#160;Canty roared out—<br/><br/>"Thou'lt meddle, wilt thou? &#160;Then have thy reward."<br/><br/>His cudgel crashed down upon the meddler's head: &#160;there was<br/>a groan, a dim form sank to the ground among the feet of the crowd,<br/>and the next moment it lay there in the dark alone. &#160;The mob<br/>pressed on, their enjoyment nothing disturbed by this episode.<br/><br/>Presently the Prince found himself in John Canty's abode, with<br/>the door closed against the outsiders. &#160;By the vague light of<br/>a tallow candle which was thrust into a bottle, he made out the<br/>main features of the loathsome den, and also the occupants of it.<br/>&#160;Two frowsy girls and a middle-aged woman cowered against the<br/>wall in one corner, with the aspect of animals habituated to harsh<br/>usage, and expecting and dreading it now. From another corner stole<br/>a withered hag with streaming grey hair and malignant eyes.<br/>&#160;John Canty said to this one—<br/><br/>"Tarry! &#160;There's fine mummeries here. &#160;Mar them not<br/>till thou'st enjoyed them: &#160;then let thy hand be heavy as thou<br/>wilt. &#160;Stand forth, lad. &#160;Now say thy foolery again, an<br/>thou'st not forgot it. Name thy name. &#160;Who art thou?"<br/><br/>The insulted blood mounted to the little prince's cheek once<br/>more, and he lifted a steady and indignant gaze to the man's face<br/>and said—<br/><br/>"'Tis but ill-breeding in such as thou to command me to speak.<br/>&#160;I tell thee now, as I told thee before, I am Edward, Prince<br/>of Wales, and none other."<br/>
