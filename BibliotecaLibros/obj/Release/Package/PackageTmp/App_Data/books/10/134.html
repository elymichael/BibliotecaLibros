Then he sauntered toward his ante-room and disappeared.<br/>&#160;The old man dropped upon his knees and whispered—<br/><br/>"God be thanked, thou'rt come again, my master! &#160;I believed<br/>thou wert dead these seven years, and lo, here thou art alive!<br/>&#160;I knew thee the moment I saw thee; and main hard work it was<br/>to keep a stony countenance and seem to see none here but tuppenny<br/>knaves and rubbish o' the streets. I am old and poor, Sir Miles;<br/>but say the word and I will go forth and proclaim the truth though<br/>I be strangled for it."<br/><br/>"No," said Hendon; "thou shalt not. &#160;It would ruin thee,<br/>and yet help but little in my cause. &#160;But I thank thee, for<br/>thou hast given me back somewhat of my lost faith in my kind."<br/><br/>The old servant became very valuable to Hendon and the King; for<br/>he dropped in several times a day to 'abuse' the former, and always<br/>smuggled in a few delicacies to help out the prison bill of fare;<br/>he also furnished the current news. &#160;Hendon reserved the<br/>dainties for the King; without them his Majesty might not have<br/>survived, for he was not able to eat the coarse and wretched food<br/>provided by the jailer. &#160;Andrews was obliged to confine<br/>himself to brief visits, in order to avoid suspicion; but he<br/>managed to impart a fair degree of information each<br/>time—information delivered in a low voice, for Hendon's benefit,<br/>and interlarded with insulting epithets delivered in a louder voice<br/>for the benefit of other hearers.<br/><br/>So, little by little, the story of the family came out.<br/>&#160;Arthur had been dead six years. &#160;This loss, with the<br/>absence of news from Hendon, impaired the father's health; he<br/>believed he was going to die, and he wished to see Hugh and Edith<br/>settled in life before he passed away; but Edith begged hard for<br/>delay, hoping for Miles's return; then the letter came which<br/>brought the news of Miles's death; the shock prostrated Sir<br/>Richard; he believed his end was very near, and he and Hugh<br/>insisted upon the marriage; Edith begged for and obtained a month's<br/>respite, then another, and finally a third; the marriage then took<br/>place by the death-bed of Sir Richard. &#160;It had not proved a<br/>happy one. &#160;It was whispered about the country that shortly<br/>after the nuptials the bride found among her husband's papers<br/>several rough and incomplete drafts of the fatal letter, and had<br/>accused him of precipitating the marriage—and Sir Richard's death,<br/>too—by a wicked forgery. Tales of cruelty to the Lady Edith and the<br/>servants were to be heard on all hands; and since the father's<br/>death Sir Hugh had thrown off all soft disguises and become a<br/>pitiless master toward all who in any way depended upon him and his<br/>domains for bread.<br/><br/>There was a bit of Andrew's gossip which the King listened to<br/>with a lively interest—<br/><br/>"There is rumour that the King is mad. &#160;But in charity<br/>forbear to say _I_ mentioned it, for 'tis death to speak of it,<br/>they say."<br/><br/>His Majesty glared at the old man and said—<br/><br/>"The King is NOT mad, good man—and thou'lt find it to thy<br/>advantage to busy thyself with matters that nearer concern thee<br/>than this seditious prattle."<br/><br/>"What doth the lad mean?" said Andrews, surprised at this brisk<br/>assault from such an unexpected quarter. &#160;Hendon gave him a<br/>sign, and he did not pursue his question, but went on with his<br/>budget—<br/><br/>"The late King is to be buried at Windsor in a day or two—the<br/>16th of the month—and the new King will be crowned at Westminster<br/>the 20th."<br/>
