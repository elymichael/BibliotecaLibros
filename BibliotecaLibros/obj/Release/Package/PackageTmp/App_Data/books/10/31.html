<br/>"Thou'rt a gentle comforter, sweet lady," said Tom, gratefully,<br/>"and my heart moveth me to thank thee for't, an' I may be so<br/>bold."<br/><br/>Once the giddy little Lady Jane fired a simple Greek phrase at<br/>Tom. &#160;The Princess Elizabeth's quick eye saw by the serene<br/>blankness of the target's front that the shaft was overshot; so she<br/>tranquilly delivered a return volley of sounding Greek on Tom's<br/>behalf, and then straightway changed the talk to other matters.<br/><br/>Time wore on pleasantly, and likewise smoothly, on the whole.<br/>Snags and sandbars grew less and less frequent, and Tom grew more<br/>and more at his ease, seeing that all were so lovingly bent upon<br/>helping him and overlooking his mistakes. &#160;When it came out<br/>that the little ladies were to accompany him to the Lord Mayor's<br/>banquet in the evening, his heart gave a bound of relief and<br/>delight, for he felt that he should not be friendless, now, among<br/>that multitude of strangers; whereas, an hour earlier, the idea of<br/>their going with him would have been an insupportable terror to<br/>him.<br/><br/>Tom's guardian angels, the two lords, had had less comfort in<br/>the interview than the other parties to it. &#160;They felt much as<br/>if they were piloting a great ship through a dangerous channel;<br/>they were on the alert constantly, and found their office no<br/>child's play. Wherefore, at last, when the ladies' visit was<br/>drawing to a close and the Lord Guilford Dudley was announced, they<br/>not only felt that their charge had been sufficiently taxed for the<br/>present, but also that they themselves were not in the best<br/>condition to take their ship back and make their anxious voyage all<br/>over again. &#160;So they respectfully advised Tom to excuse<br/>himself, which he was very glad to do, although a slight shade of<br/>disappointment might have been observed upon my Lady Jane's face<br/>when she heard the splendid stripling denied admittance.<br/><br/>There was a pause now, a sort of waiting silence which Tom could<br/>not understand. &#160;He glanced at Lord Hertford, who gave him a<br/>sign—but he failed to understand that also. &#160;The ready<br/>Elizabeth came to the rescue with her usual easy grace. &#160;She<br/>made reverence and said—<br/><br/>"Have we leave of the prince's grace my brother to go?"<br/><br/>Tom said—<br/><br/>"Indeed your ladyships can have whatsoever of me they will, for<br/>the asking; yet would I rather give them any other thing that in my<br/>poor power lieth, than leave to take the light and blessing of<br/>their presence hence. &#160;Give ye good den, and God be with ye!"<br/>Then he smiled inwardly at the thought, "'Tis not for nought I have<br/>dwelt but among princes in my reading, and taught my tongue some<br/>slight trick of their broidered and gracious speech withal!"<br/><br/>When the illustrious maidens were gone, Tom turned wearily to<br/>his keepers and said—<br/><br/>"May it please your lordships to grant me leave to go into some<br/>corner and rest me?"<br/><br/>
