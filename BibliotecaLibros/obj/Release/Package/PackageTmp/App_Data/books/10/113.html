<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>23<br/>The Prince a prisoner<br/><br/><br/>Hendon forced back a smile, and bent down and whispered in the<br/>King's ear—<br/><br/>"Softly, softly, my prince, wag thy tongue warily—nay, suffer it<br/>not to wag at all. &#160;Trust in me—all shall go well in the end."<br/>Then he added to himself: &#160;"SIR Miles! &#160;Bless me, I had<br/>totally forgot I was a knight! Lord, how marvellous a thing it is,<br/>the grip his memory doth take upon his quaint and crazy<br/>fancies!&#160;… An empty and foolish title is mine, and yet it is<br/>something to have deserved it; for I think it is more honour to be<br/>held worthy to be a spectre-knight in his Kingdom of Dreams and<br/>Shadows, than to be held base enough to be an earl in some of the<br/>REAL kingdoms of this world."<br/><br/>The crowd fell apart to admit a constable, who approached and<br/>was about to lay his hand upon the King's shoulder, when Hendon<br/>said—<br/><br/>"Gently, good friend, withhold your hand—he shall go peaceably;<br/>I am responsible for that. &#160;Lead on, we will follow."<br/><br/>The officer led, with the woman and her bundle; Miles and the<br/>King followed after, with the crowd at their heels. &#160;The King<br/>was inclined to rebel; but Hendon said to him in a low voice—<br/><br/>"Reflect, Sire—your laws are the wholesome breath of your own<br/>royalty; shall their source resist them, yet require the branches<br/>to respect them? Apparently one of these laws has been broken; when<br/>the King is on his throne again, can it ever grieve him to remember<br/>that when he was seemingly a private person he loyally sank the<br/>king in the citizen and submitted to its authority?"<br/><br/>"Thou art right; say no more; thou shalt see that whatsoever the<br/>King of England requires a subject to suffer, under the law, he<br/>will himself suffer while he holdeth the station of a subject."<br/>
