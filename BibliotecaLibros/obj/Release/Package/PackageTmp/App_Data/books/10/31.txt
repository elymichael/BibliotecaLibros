"Thou'rt a gentle comforter, sweet lady," said Tom, gratefully,
"and my heart moveth me to thank thee for't, an' I may be so
bold."

Once the giddy little Lady Jane fired a simple Greek phrase at
Tom. &#160;The Princess Elizabeth's quick eye saw by the serene
blankness of the target's front that the shaft was overshot; so she
tranquilly delivered a return volley of sounding Greek on Tom's
behalf, and then straightway changed the talk to other matters.

Time wore on pleasantly, and likewise smoothly, on the whole.
Snags and sandbars grew less and less frequent, and Tom grew more
and more at his ease, seeing that all were so lovingly bent upon
helping him and overlooking his mistakes. &#160;When it came out
that the little ladies were to accompany him to the Lord Mayor's
banquet in the evening, his heart gave a bound of relief and
delight, for he felt that he should not be friendless, now, among
that multitude of strangers; whereas, an hour earlier, the idea of
their going with him would have been an insupportable terror to
him.

Tom's guardian angels, the two lords, had had less comfort in
the interview than the other parties to it. &#160;They felt much as
if they were piloting a great ship through a dangerous channel;
they were on the alert constantly, and found their office no
child's play. Wherefore, at last, when the ladies' visit was
drawing to a close and the Lord Guilford Dudley was announced, they
not only felt that their charge had been sufficiently taxed for the
present, but also that they themselves were not in the best
condition to take their ship back and make their anxious voyage all
over again. &#160;So they respectfully advised Tom to excuse
himself, which he was very glad to do, although a slight shade of
disappointment might have been observed upon my Lady Jane's face
when she heard the splendid stripling denied admittance.

There was a pause now, a sort of waiting silence which Tom could
not understand. &#160;He glanced at Lord Hertford, who gave him a
sign—but he failed to understand that also. &#160;The ready
Elizabeth came to the rescue with her usual easy grace. &#160;She
made reverence and said—

"Have we leave of the prince's grace my brother to go?"

Tom said—

"Indeed your ladyships can have whatsoever of me they will, for
the asking; yet would I rather give them any other thing that in my
poor power lieth, than leave to take the light and blessing of
their presence hence. &#160;Give ye good den, and God be with ye!"
Then he smiled inwardly at the thought, "'Tis not for nought I have
dwelt but among princes in my reading, and taught my tongue some
slight trick of their broidered and gracious speech withal!"

When the illustrious maidens were gone, Tom turned wearily to
his keepers and said—

"May it please your lordships to grant me leave to go into some
corner and rest me?"
