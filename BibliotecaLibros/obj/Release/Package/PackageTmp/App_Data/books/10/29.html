<br/>"The King hath said it. &#160;None may palter with the King's<br/>command, or fit it to his ease, where it doth chafe, with deft<br/>evasions. The King shall be obeyed."<br/><br/>Lord Hertford said—<br/><br/>"Touching the King's majesty's ordainment concerning books and<br/>such like serious matters, it may peradventure please your highness<br/>to ease your time with lightsome entertainment, lest you go wearied<br/>to the banquet and suffer harm thereby."<br/><br/>Tom's face showed inquiring surprise; and a blush followed when<br/>he saw Lord St. John's eyes bent sorrowfully upon him. &#160;His<br/>lordship said—<br/><br/>"Thy memory still wrongeth thee, and thou hast shown<br/>surprise—but suffer it not to trouble thee, for 'tis a matter that<br/>will not bide, but depart with thy mending malady. &#160;My Lord of<br/>Hertford speaketh of the city's banquet which the King's majesty<br/>did promise, some two months flown, your highness should attend.<br/>&#160;Thou recallest it now?"<br/><br/>"It grieves me to confess it had indeed escaped me," said Tom,<br/>in a hesitating voice; and blushed again.<br/><br/>At this moment the Lady Elizabeth and the Lady Jane Grey were<br/>announced. The two lords exchanged significant glances, and<br/>Hertford stepped quickly toward the door. &#160;As the young girls<br/>passed him, he said in a low voice—<br/><br/>"I pray ye, ladies, seem not to observe his humours, nor show<br/>surprise when his memory doth lapse—it will grieve you to note how<br/>it doth stick at every trifle."<br/><br/>Meantime Lord St. John was saying in Tom's ear—<br/><br/>"Please you, sir, keep diligently in mind his majesty's desire.<br/>Remember all thou canst—SEEM to remember all else. &#160;Let them<br/>not perceive that thou art much changed from thy wont, for thou<br/>knowest how tenderly thy old play-fellows bear thee in their hearts<br/>and how 'twould grieve them. Art willing, sir, that I remain?—and<br/>thine uncle?"<br/><br/>
