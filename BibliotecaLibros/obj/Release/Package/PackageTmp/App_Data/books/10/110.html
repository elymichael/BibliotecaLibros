<br/>Hugo got the help of the tinker whom the King had cowed with the<br/>soldering-iron; they took the boy out on a tinkering tramp, and as<br/>soon as they were out of sight of the camp they threw him down and<br/>the tinker held him while Hugo bound the poultice tight and fast<br/>upon his leg.<br/><br/>The King raged and stormed, and promised to hang the two the<br/>moment the sceptre was in his hand again; but they kept a firm grip<br/>upon him and enjoyed his impotent struggling and jeered at his<br/>threats. &#160;This continued until the poultice began to bite; and<br/>in no long time its work would have been perfected, if there had<br/>been no interruption. &#160;But there was; for about this time the<br/>'slave' who had made the speech denouncing England's laws, appeared<br/>on the scene, and put an end to the enterprise, and stripped off<br/>the poultice and bandage.<br/><br/>The King wanted to borrow his deliverer's cudgel and warm the<br/>jackets of the two rascals on the spot; but the man said no, it<br/>would bring trouble—leave the matter till night; the whole tribe<br/>being together, then, the outside world would not venture to<br/>interfere or interrupt. &#160;He marched the party back to camp and<br/>reported the affair to the Ruffler, who listened, pondered, and<br/>then decided that the King should not be again detailed to beg,<br/>since it was plain he was worthy of something higher and<br/>better—wherefore, on the spot he promoted him from the mendicant<br/>rank and appointed him to steal!<br/><br/>Hugo was overjoyed. &#160;He had already tried to make the King<br/>steal, and failed; but there would be no more trouble of that sort,<br/>now, for of course the King would not dream of defying a distinct<br/>command delivered directly from head-quarters. &#160;So he planned<br/>a raid for that very afternoon, purposing to get the King in the<br/>law's grip in the course of it; and to do it, too, with such<br/>ingenious strategy, that it should seem to be accidental and<br/>unintentional; for the King of the Game-Cocks was popular now, and<br/>the gang might not deal over-gently with an unpopular member who<br/>played so serious a treachery upon him as the delivering him over<br/>to the common enemy, the law.<br/><br/>Very well. &#160;All in good time Hugo strolled off to a<br/>neighbouring village with his prey; and the two drifted slowly up<br/>and down one street after another, the one watching sharply for a<br/>sure chance to achieve his evil purpose, and the other watching as<br/>sharply for a chance to dart away and get free of his infamous<br/>captivity for ever.<br/><br/>Both threw away some tolerably fair-looking opportunities; for<br/>both, in their secret hearts, were resolved to make absolutely sure<br/>work this time, and neither meant to allow his fevered desires to<br/>seduce him into any venture that had much uncertainty about it.<br/><br/>Hugo's chance came first. &#160;For at last a woman approached<br/>who carried a fat package of some sort in a basket. &#160;Hugo's<br/>eyes sparkled with sinful pleasure as he said to himself, "Breath<br/>o' my life, an' I can but put THAT upon him, 'tis good-den and God<br/>keep thee, King of the Game-Cocks!" He waited and watched—outwardly<br/>patient, but inwardly consuming with excitement—till the woman had<br/>passed by, and the time was ripe; then said, in a low voice—<br/><br/>"Tarry here till I come again," and darted stealthily after the<br/>prey.<br/><br/>The King's heart was filled with joy—he could make his escape,<br/>now, if Hugo's quest only carried him far enough away.<br/><br/>But he was to have no such luck. &#160;Hugo crept behind the<br/>woman, snatched the package, and came running back, wrapping it in<br/>an old piece of blanket which he carried on his arm. &#160;The hue<br/>and cry was raised in a moment, by the woman, who knew her loss by<br/>the lightening of her burden, although she had not seen the<br/>pilfering done. &#160;Hugo thrust the bundle into the King's hands<br/>without halting, saying—<br/><br/>
