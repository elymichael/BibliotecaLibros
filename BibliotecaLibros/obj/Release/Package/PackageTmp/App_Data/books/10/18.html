<br/>The prince's face flushed with anger, and his ready hand flew to<br/>his hip, but there was nothing there. &#160;There was a storm of<br/>laughter, and one boy said—<br/><br/>"Didst mark that? &#160;He fancied he had a sword—belike he is<br/>the prince himself."<br/><br/>This sally brought more laughter. &#160;Poor Edward drew himself<br/>up proudly and said—<br/><br/>"I am the prince; and it ill beseemeth you that feed upon the<br/>king my father's bounty to use me so."<br/><br/>This was vastly enjoyed, as the laughter testified. &#160;The<br/>youth who had first spoken, shouted to his comrades—<br/><br/>"Ho, swine, slaves, pensioners of his grace's princely father,<br/>where be your manners? &#160;Down on your marrow bones, all of ye,<br/>and do reverence to his kingly port and royal rags!"<br/><br/>With boisterous mirth they dropped upon their knees in a body<br/>and did mock homage to their prey. &#160;The prince spurned the<br/>nearest boy with his foot, and said fiercely—<br/><br/>"Take thou that, till the morrow come and I build thee a<br/>gibbet!"<br/><br/>Ah, but this was not a joke—this was going beyond fun. &#160;The<br/>laughter ceased on the instant, and fury took its place. &#160;A<br/>dozen shouted—<br/><br/>"Hale him forth! &#160;To the horse-pond, to the horse-pond!<br/>&#160;Where be the dogs? &#160;Ho, there, Lion! ho, Fangs!"<br/><br/>
