<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>19<br/>The Prince with the peasants<br/><br/><br/>When the King awoke in the early morning, he found that a wet<br/>but thoughtful rat had crept into the place during the night and<br/>made a cosy bed for itself in his bosom. &#160;Being disturbed now,<br/>it scampered away. The boy smiled, and said, "Poor fool, why so<br/>fearful? &#160;I am as forlorn as thou. &#160;'Twould be a sham in<br/>me to hurt the helpless, who am myself so helpless. &#160;Moreover,<br/>I owe you thanks for a good omen; for when a king has fallen so low<br/>that the very rats do make a bed of him, it surely meaneth that his<br/>fortunes be upon the turn, since it is plain he can no lower<br/>go."<br/><br/>He got up and stepped out of the stall, and just then he heard<br/>the sound of children's voices. &#160;The barn door opened and a<br/>couple of little girls came in. &#160;As soon as they saw him their<br/>talking and laughing ceased, and they stopped and stood still,<br/>gazing at him with strong curiosity; they presently began to<br/>whisper together, then they approached nearer, and stopped again to<br/>gaze and whisper. &#160;By-and-by they gathered courage and began<br/>to discuss him aloud. &#160;One said—<br/><br/>"He hath a comely face."<br/><br/>The other added—<br/><br/>"And pretty hair."<br/><br/>"But is ill clothed enow."<br/><br/>"And how starved he looketh."<br/>
