The prince's eyes flashed. &#160;Said he—

"Marry, that would not I mislike. &#160;Tell me more."

"We strive in races, sir, to see who of us shall be
fleetest."

"That would I like also. &#160;Speak on."

"In summer, sir, we wade and swim in the canals and in the
river, and each doth duck his neighbour, and splatter him with
water, and dive and shout and tumble and—"

"'Twould be worth my father's kingdom but to enjoy it once!
Prithee go on."

"We dance and sing about the Maypole in Cheapside; we play in
the sand, each covering his neighbour up; and times we make mud
pastry—oh the lovely mud, it hath not its like for delightfulness
in all the world!—we do fairly wallow in the mud, sir, saving your
worship's presence."

"Oh, prithee, say no more, 'tis glorious! &#160;If that I could
but clothe me in raiment like to thine, and strip my feet, and
revel in the mud once, just once, with none to rebuke me or forbid,
meseemeth I could forego the crown!"

"And if that I could clothe me once, sweet sir, as thou art
clad—just once—"

"Oho, would'st like it? &#160;Then so shall it be. &#160;Doff
thy rags, and don these splendours, lad! &#160;It is a brief
happiness, but will be not less keen for that. &#160;We will have
it while we may, and change again before any come to molest."
