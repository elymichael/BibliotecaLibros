<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>7<br/>Tom's first royal dinner<br/><br/><br/>Somewhat after one in the afternoon, Tom resignedly underwent<br/>the ordeal of being dressed for dinner. &#160;He found himself as<br/>finely clothed as before, but everything different, everything<br/>changed, from his ruff to his stockings. &#160;He was presently<br/>conducted with much state to a spacious and ornate apartment, where<br/>a table was already set for one. &#160;Its furniture was all of<br/>massy gold, and beautified with designs which well-nigh made it<br/>priceless, since they were the work of Benvenuto. &#160;The room<br/>was half-filled with noble servitors. &#160;A chaplain said grace,<br/>and Tom was about to fall to, for hunger had long been<br/>constitutional with him, but was interrupted by my lord the Earl of<br/>Berkeley, who fastened a napkin about his neck; for the great post<br/>of Diaperers to the Prince of Wales was hereditary in this<br/>nobleman's family. &#160;Tom's cupbearer was present, and<br/>forestalled all his attempts to help himself to wine. &#160;The<br/>Taster to his highness the Prince of Wales was there also, prepared<br/>to taste any suspicious dish upon requirement, and run the risk of<br/>being poisoned. &#160;He was only an ornamental appendage at this<br/>time, and was seldom called upon to exercise his function; but<br/>there had been times, not many generations past, when the office of<br/>taster had its perils, and was not a grandeur to be desired.<br/>&#160;Why they did not use a dog or a plumber seems strange; but<br/>all the ways of royalty are strange. &#160;My Lord d'Arcy, First<br/>Groom of the Chamber, was there, to do goodness knows what; but<br/>there he was—let that suffice. &#160;The Lord Chief Butler was<br/>there, and stood behind Tom's chair, overseeing the solemnities,<br/>under command of the Lord Great Steward and the Lord Head Cook, who<br/>stood near. &#160;Tom had three hundred and eighty-four servants<br/>beside these; but they were not all in that room, of course, nor<br/>the quarter of them; neither was Tom aware yet that they<br/>existed.<br/><br/>All those that were present had been well drilled within the<br/>hour to remember that the prince was temporarily out of his head,<br/>and to be careful to show no surprise at his vagaries. &#160;These<br/>'vagaries' were soon on exhibition before them; but they only moved<br/>their compassion and their sorrow, not their mirth. &#160;It was a<br/>heavy affliction to them to see the beloved prince so stricken.<br/><br/>Poor Tom ate with his fingers mainly; but no one smiled at it,<br/>or even seemed to observe it. &#160;He inspected his napkin<br/>curiously, and with deep interest, for it was of a very dainty and<br/>beautiful fabric, then said with simplicity—<br/><br/>"Prithee, take it away, lest in mine unheedfulness it be<br/>soiled."<br/><br/>The Hereditary Diaperer took it away with reverent manner, and<br/>without word or protest of any sort.<br/><br/>Tom examined the turnips and the lettuce with interest, and<br/>asked what they were, and if they were to be eaten; for it was only<br/>recently that men had begun to raise these things in England in<br/>place of importing them as luxuries from Holland.<br/>[4]<br/>&#160;His question was answered with<br/>grave respect, and no surprise manifested. &#160;When he had<br/>finished his dessert, he filled his pockets with nuts; but nobody<br/>appeared to be aware of it, or disturbed by it. &#160;But the next<br/>moment he was himself disturbed by it, and showed discomposure; for<br/>this was the only service he had been permitted to do with his own<br/>hands during the meal, and he did not doubt that he had done a most<br/>improper and unprincely thing. &#160;At that moment the muscles of<br/>his nose began to twitch, and the end of that organ to lift and<br/>wrinkle. &#160;This continued, and Tom began to evince a growing<br/>distress. &#160;He looked appealingly, first at one and then<br/>another of the lords about him, and tears came into his eyes.<br/>&#160;They sprang forward with dismay in their faces, and begged to<br/>know his trouble. &#160;Tom said with genuine anguish—<br/>
