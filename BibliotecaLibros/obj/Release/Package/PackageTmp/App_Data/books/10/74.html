"It is the law, your Grace—for poisoners. &#160;In Germany<br/>coiners be boiled to death in OIL—not cast in of a sudden, but by a<br/>rope let down into the oil by degrees, and slowly; first the feet,<br/>then the legs, then—"<br/><br/>"O prithee no more, my lord, I cannot bear it!" cried Tom,<br/>covering his eyes with his hands to shut out the picture. &#160;"I<br/>beseech your good lordship that order be taken to change this<br/>law—oh, let no more poor creatures be visited with its<br/>tortures."<br/><br/>The Earl's face showed profound gratification, for he was a man<br/>of merciful and generous impulses—a thing not very common with his<br/>class in that fierce age. &#160;He said—<br/><br/>"These your Grace's noble words have sealed its doom.<br/>&#160;History will remember it to the honour of your royal<br/>house."<br/><br/>The under-sheriff was about to remove his prisoner; Tom gave him<br/>a sign to wait; then he said—<br/><br/>"Good sir, I would look into this matter further. &#160;The man<br/>has said his deed was but lamely proved. &#160;Tell me what thou<br/>knowest."<br/><br/>"If the King's grace please, it did appear upon the trial that<br/>this man entered into a house in the hamlet of Islington where one<br/>lay sick—three witnesses say it was at ten of the clock in the<br/>morning, and two say it was some minutes later—the sick man being<br/>alone at the time, and sleeping—and presently the man came forth<br/>again and went his way. &#160;The sick man died within the hour,<br/>being torn with spasms and retchings."<br/><br/>"Did any see the poison given? &#160;Was poison found?"<br/><br/>"Marry, no, my liege."<br/><br/>"Then how doth one know there was poison given at all?"<br/><br/>"Please your Majesty, the doctors testified that none die with<br/>such symptoms but by poison."<br/>
