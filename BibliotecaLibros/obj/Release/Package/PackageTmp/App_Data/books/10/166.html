<br/><br/><br/>General note<br/><br/><br/>One hears much about the 'hideous Blue Laws of Connecticut,' and<br/>is accustomed to shudder piously when they are mentioned.<br/>&#160;There are people in America—and even in England!—who imagine<br/>that they were a very monument of malignity, pitilessness, and<br/>inhumanity; whereas in reality they were about the first SWEEPING<br/>DEPARTURE FROM JUDICIAL ATROCITY which the 'civilised' world had<br/>seen. &#160;This humane and kindly Blue Law Code, of two hundred<br/>and forty years ago, stands all by itself, with ages of bloody law<br/>on the further side of it, and a century and three-quarters of<br/>bloody English law on THIS side of it.<br/><br/>There has never been a time—under the Blue Laws or any<br/>other—when above FOURTEEN crimes were punishable by death in<br/>Connecticut. &#160;But in England, within the memory of men who are<br/>still hale in body and mind, TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY-THREE crimes<br/>were punishable by death! &#160;These facts are worth knowing—and<br/>worth thinking about, too.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
