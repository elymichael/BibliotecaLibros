"He is armed, Sir Hugh, and we are weaponless."

"Armed! &#160;What of it, and ye so many? &#160;Upon him, I
say!"

But Miles warned them to be careful what they did, and
added—

"Ye know me of old—I have not changed; come on, an' it like
you."

This reminder did not hearten the servants much; they still held
back.

"Then go, ye paltry cowards, and arm yourselves and guard the
doors, whilst I send one to fetch the watch!" said Hugh. &#160;He
turned at the threshold, and said to Miles, "You'll find it to your
advantage to offend not with useless endeavours at escape."

"Escape? &#160;Spare thyself discomfort, an' that is all that
troubles thee. For Miles Hendon is master of Hendon Hall and all
its belongings. &#160;He will remain—doubt it not."
