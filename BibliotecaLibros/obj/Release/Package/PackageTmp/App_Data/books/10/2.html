<br/><br/>About Twain:<br/><br/>Samuel Langhorne Clemens (November 30, 1835 â€” April 21, 1910),<br/>better known by the pen name Mark Twain, was an American humorist,<br/>satirist, writer, and lecturer. Twain is most noted for his novels<br/>Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, which has since been called the<br/>Great American Novel, and The Adventures of Tom Sawyer. He is also<br/>known for his quotations. During his lifetime, Clemens became a<br/>friend to presidents, artists, leading industrialists, and European<br/>royalty. Clemens enjoyed immense public popularity, and his keen<br/>wit and incisive satire earned him praise from both critics and<br/>peers. American author William Faulkner called Twain "the father of<br/>American literature."
