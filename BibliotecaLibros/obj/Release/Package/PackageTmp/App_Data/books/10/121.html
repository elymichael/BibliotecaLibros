<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>25<br/>Hendon Hall<br/><br/><br/>As soon as Hendon and the King were out of sight of the<br/>constable, his Majesty was instructed to hurry to a certain place<br/>outside the town, and wait there, whilst Hendon should go to the<br/>inn and settle his account. Half an hour later the two friends were<br/>blithely jogging eastward on Hendon's sorry steeds. &#160;The King<br/>was warm and comfortable, now, for he had cast his rags and clothed<br/>himself in the second-hand suit which Hendon had bought on London<br/>Bridge.<br/><br/>Hendon wished to guard against over-fatiguing the boy; he judged<br/>that hard journeys, irregular meals, and illiberal measures of<br/>sleep would be bad for his crazed mind; whilst rest, regularity,<br/>and moderate exercise would be pretty sure to hasten its cure; he<br/>longed to see the stricken intellect made well again and its<br/>diseased visions driven out of the tormented little head; therefore<br/>he resolved to move by easy stages toward the home whence he had so<br/>long been banished, instead of obeying the impulse of his<br/>impatience and hurrying along night and day.<br/><br/>When he and the King had journeyed about ten miles, they reached<br/>a considerable village, and halted there for the night, at a good<br/>inn. &#160;The former relations were resumed; Hendon stood behind<br/>the King's chair, while he dined, and waited upon him; undressed<br/>him when he was ready for bed; then took the floor for his own<br/>quarters, and slept athwart the door, rolled up in a blanket.<br/><br/>The next day, and the day after, they jogged lazily along<br/>talking over the adventures they had met since their separation,<br/>and mightily enjoying each other's narratives. &#160;Hendon<br/>detailed all his wide wanderings in search of the King, and<br/>described how the archangel had led him a fool's journey all over<br/>the forest, and taken him back to the hut, finally, when he found<br/>he could not get rid of him. &#160;Then—he said—the old man went<br/>into the bedchamber and came staggering back looking<br/>broken-hearted, and saying he had expected to find that the boy had<br/>returned and laid down in there to rest, but it was not so.<br/>&#160;Hendon had waited at the hut all day; hope of the King's<br/>return died out, then, and he departed upon the quest again.<br/><br/>"And old Sanctum Sanctorum WAS truly sorry your highness came<br/>not back," said Hendon; "I saw it in his face."<br/><br/>"Marry I will never doubt THAT!" said the King—and then told his<br/>own story; after which, Hendon was sorry he had not destroyed the<br/>archangel.<br/><br/>During the last day of the trip, Hendon's spirits were soaring.<br/>His tongue ran constantly. &#160;He talked about his old father,<br/>and his brother Arthur, and told of many things which illustrated<br/>their high and generous characters; he went into loving frenzies<br/>over his Edith, and was so glad-hearted that he was even able to<br/>say some gentle and brotherly things about Hugh. &#160;He dwelt a<br/>deal on the coming meeting at Hendon Hall; what a surprise it would<br/>be to everybody, and what an outburst of thanksgiving and delight<br/>there would be.<br/>
