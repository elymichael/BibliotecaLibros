<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>15<br/>Tom as King<br/><br/><br/>The next day the foreign ambassadors came, with their gorgeous<br/>trains; and Tom, throned in awful state, received them. &#160;The<br/>splendours of the scene delighted his eye and fired his imagination<br/>at first, but the audience was long and dreary, and so were most of<br/>the addresses—wherefore, what began as a pleasure grew into<br/>weariness and home-sickness by-and-by. &#160;Tom said the words<br/>which Hertford put into his mouth from time to time, and tried hard<br/>to acquit himself satisfactorily, but he was too new to such<br/>things, and too ill at ease to accomplish more than a tolerable<br/>success. &#160;He looked sufficiently like a king, but he was ill<br/>able to feel like one. &#160;He was cordially glad when the<br/>ceremony was ended.<br/><br/>The larger part of his day was 'wasted'—as he termed it, in his<br/>own mind—in labours pertaining to his royal office. &#160;Even the<br/>two hours devoted to certain princely pastimes and recreations were<br/>rather a burden to him than otherwise, they were so fettered by<br/>restrictions and ceremonious observances. &#160;However, he had a<br/>private hour with his whipping-boy which he counted clear gain,<br/>since he got both entertainment and needful information out of<br/>it.<br/><br/>The third day of Tom Canty's kingship came and went much as the<br/>others had done, but there was a lifting of his cloud in one way—he<br/>felt less uncomfortable than at first; he was getting a little used<br/>to his circumstances and surroundings; his chains still galled, but<br/>not all the time; he found that the presence and homage of the<br/>great afflicted and embarrassed him less and less sharply with<br/>every hour that drifted over his head.<br/><br/>But for one single dread, he could have seen the fourth day<br/>approach without serious distress—the dining in public; it was to<br/>begin that day. There were greater matters in the programme—for on<br/>that day he would have to preside at a council which would take his<br/>views and commands concerning the policy to be pursued toward<br/>various foreign nations scattered far and near over the great<br/>globe; on that day, too, Hertford would be formally chosen to the<br/>grand office of Lord Protector; other things of note were appointed<br/>for that fourth day, also; but to Tom they were all insignificant<br/>compared with the ordeal of dining all by himself with a multitude<br/>of curious eyes fastened upon him and a multitude of mouths<br/>whispering comments upon his performance,—and upon his mistakes, if<br/>he should be so unlucky as to make any.<br/><br/>Still, nothing could stop that fourth day, and so it came.<br/>&#160;It found poor Tom low-spirited and absent-minded, and this<br/>mood continued; he could not shake it off. &#160;The ordinary<br/>duties of the morning dragged upon his hands, and wearied him.<br/>&#160;Once more he felt the sense of captivity heavy upon him.<br/><br/>Late in the forenoon he was in a large audience-chamber,<br/>conversing with the Earl of Hertford and dully awaiting the<br/>striking of the hour appointed for a visit of ceremony from a<br/>considerable number of great officials and courtiers.<br/><br/>After a little while, Tom, who had wandered to a window and<br/>become interested in the life and movement of the great highway<br/>beyond the palace gates—and not idly interested, but longing with<br/>all his heart to take part in person in its stir and freedom—saw<br/>the van of a hooting and shouting mob of disorderly men, women, and<br/>children of the lowest and poorest degree approaching from up the<br/>road.<br/>
