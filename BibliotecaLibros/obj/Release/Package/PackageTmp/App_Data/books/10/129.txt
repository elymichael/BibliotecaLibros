"Indeed? &#160;Doth it not strike you as being passing strange
that the land is not filled with couriers and proclamations
describing my person and making search for me? &#160;Is it no
matter for commotion and distress that the Head of the State is
gone; that I am vanished away and lost?"

"Most true, my King, I had forgot." &#160;Then Hendon sighed,
and muttered to himself, "Poor ruined mind—still busy with its
pathetic dream."

"But I have a plan that shall right us both—I will write a
paper, in three tongues—Latin, Greek and English—and thou shalt
haste away with it to London in the morning. &#160;Give it to none
but my uncle, the Lord Hertford; when he shall see it, he will know
and say I wrote it. &#160;Then he will send for me."

"Might it not be best, my Prince, that we wait here until I
prove myself and make my rights secure to my domains? &#160;I
should be so much the better able then to—"

The King interrupted him imperiously—

"Peace! &#160;What are thy paltry domains, thy trivial
interests, contrasted with matters which concern the weal of a
nation and the integrity of a throne?" &#160;Then, he added, in a
gentle voice, as if he were sorry for his severity, "Obey, and have
no fear; I will right thee, I will make thee whole—yes, more than
whole. &#160;I shall remember, and requite."

So saying, he took the pen, and set himself to work.
&#160;Hendon contemplated him lovingly a while, then said to
himself—

"An' it were dark, I should think it WAS a king that spoke;
there's no denying it, when the humour's upon on him he doth
thunder and lighten like your true King; now where got he that
trick? &#160;See him scribble and scratch away contentedly at his
meaningless pot-hooks, fancying them to be Latin and Greek—and
except my wit shall serve me with a lucky device for diverting him
from his purpose, I shall be forced to pretend to post away
to-morrow on this wild errand he hath invented for me."

The next moment Sir Miles's thoughts had gone back to the recent
episode. So absorbed was he in his musings, that when the King
presently handed him the paper which he had been writing, he
received it and pocketed it without being conscious of the act.
"How marvellous strange she acted," he muttered. &#160;"I think she
knew me—and I think she did NOT know me. These opinions do
conflict, I perceive it plainly; I cannot reconcile them, neither
can I, by argument, dismiss either of the two, or even persuade one
to outweigh the other. &#160;The matter standeth simply thus: she
MUST have known my face, my figure, my voice, for how could it be
otherwise? &#160;Yet she SAID she knew me not, and that is proof
perfect, for she cannot lie. &#160;But stop—I think I begin to see.
Peradventure he hath influenced her, commanded her, compelled her
to lie. &#160;That is the solution. &#160;The riddle is unriddled.
&#160;She seemed dead with fear—yes, she was under his compulsion.
&#160;I will seek her; I will find her; now that he is away, she
will speak her true mind. &#160;She will remember the old times
when we were little playfellows together, and this will soften her
heart, and she will no more betray me, but will confess me.
&#160;There is no treacherous blood in her—no, she was always
honest and true. &#160;She has loved me, in those old days—this is
my security; for whom one has loved, one cannot betray."

He stepped eagerly toward the door; at that moment it opened,
and the Lady Edith entered. &#160;She was very pale, but she walked
with a firm step, and her carriage was full of grace and gentle
dignity. Her face was as sad as before.
