"None, sir. &#160;Would'st have them take off their garment, and<br/>sleep without—like the beasts?"<br/><br/>"Their garment! &#160;Have they but one?"<br/><br/>"Ah, good your worship, what would they do with more?<br/>&#160;Truly they have not two bodies each."<br/><br/>"It is a quaint and marvellous thought! &#160;Thy pardon, I had<br/>not meant to laugh. &#160;But thy good Nan and thy Bet shall have<br/>raiment and lackeys enow, and that soon, too: &#160;my cofferer<br/>shall look to it. &#160;No, thank me not; 'tis nothing. &#160;Thou<br/>speakest well; thou hast an easy grace in it. &#160;Art<br/>learned?"<br/><br/>"I know not if I am or not, sir. &#160;The good priest that is<br/>called Father Andrew taught me, of his kindness, from his<br/>books."<br/><br/>"Know'st thou the Latin?"<br/><br/>"But scantly, sir, I doubt."<br/><br/>"Learn it, lad: &#160;'tis hard only at first. &#160;The Greek<br/>is harder; but neither these nor any tongues else, I think, are<br/>hard to the Lady Elizabeth and my cousin. &#160;Thou should'st hear<br/>those damsels at it! &#160;But tell me of thy Offal Court.<br/>&#160;Hast thou a pleasant life there?"<br/><br/>"In truth, yes, so please you, sir, save when one is hungry.<br/>There be Punch-and-Judy shows, and monkeys—oh such antic creatures!<br/>and so bravely dressed!—and there be plays wherein they that play<br/>do shout and fight till all are slain, and 'tis so fine to see, and<br/>costeth but a farthing—albeit 'tis main hard to get the farthing,<br/>please your worship."<br/><br/>"Tell me more."<br/><br/>"We lads of Offal Court do strive against each other with the<br/>cudgel, like to the fashion of the 'prentices, sometimes."<br/>
