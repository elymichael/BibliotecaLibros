He stared about him in speechless astonishment for a moment;
noticed for the first time that his ward's ragged raiment was also
missing; then he began to rage and storm and shout for the
innkeeper. &#160;At that moment a servant entered with the
breakfast.

"Explain, thou limb of Satan, or thy time is come!" roared the
man of war, and made so savage a spring toward the waiter that this
latter could not find his tongue, for the instant, for fright and
surprise. &#160;"Where is the boy?"

In disjointed and trembling syllables the man gave the
information desired.

"You were hardly gone from the place, your worship, when a youth
came running and said it was your worship's will that the boy come
to you straight, at the bridge-end on the Southwark side. &#160;I
brought him hither; and when he woke the lad and gave his message,
the lad did grumble some little for being disturbed 'so early,' as
he called it, but straightway trussed on his rags and went with the
youth, only saying it had been better manners that your worship
came yourself, not sent a stranger—and so—"

"And so thou'rt a fool!—a fool and easily cozened—hang all thy
breed! Yet mayhap no hurt is done. &#160;Possibly no harm is meant
the boy. &#160;I will go fetch him. &#160;Make the table ready.
&#160;Stay! the coverings of the bed were disposed as if one lay
beneath them—happened that by accident?"

"I know not, good your worship. &#160;I saw the youth meddle
with them—he that came for the boy."

"Thousand deaths! &#160;'Twas done to deceive me—'tis plain
'twas done to gain time. &#160;Hark ye! &#160;Was that youth
alone?"

"All alone, your worship."

"Art sure?"

"Sure, your worship."

"Collect thy scattered wits—bethink thee—take time, man."
