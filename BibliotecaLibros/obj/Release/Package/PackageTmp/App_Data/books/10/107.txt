"Mayhap it was. &#160;Yes, doubtless that was it. &#160;I have
been hearing it faintly all the—there it is again! &#160;It is not
the wind! &#160;What an odd sound! &#160;Come, we will hunt it
out!"

Now the King's joy was nearly insupportable. &#160;His tired
lungs did their utmost—and hopefully, too—but the sealed jaws and
the muffling sheepskin sadly crippled the effort. &#160;Then the
poor fellow's heart sank, to hear the hermit say—

"Ah, it came from without—I think from the copse yonder.
&#160;Come, I will lead the way."

The King heard the two pass out, talking; heard their footsteps
die quickly away—then he was alone with a boding, brooding, awful
silence.

It seemed an age till he heard the steps and voices approaching
again—and this time he heard an added sound,—the trampling of
hoofs, apparently. &#160;Then he heard Hendon say—

"I will not wait longer. &#160;I CANNOT wait longer. &#160;He
has lost his way in this thick wood. &#160;Which direction took he?
&#160;Quick—point it out to me."

"He—but wait; I will go with thee."

"Good—good! &#160;Why, truly thou art better than thy looks.
&#160;Marry I do not think there's not another archangel with so
right a heart as thine. &#160;Wilt ride? &#160;Wilt take the wee
donkey that's for my boy, or wilt thou fork thy holy legs over this
ill-conditioned slave of a mule that I have provided for
myself?—and had been cheated in too, had he cost but the
indifferent sum of a month's usury on a brass farthing let to a
tinker out of work."

"No—ride thy mule, and lead thine ass; I am surer on mine own
feet, and will walk."

"Then prithee mind the little beast for me while I take my life
in my hands and make what success I may toward mounting the big
one."
