<br/>The Ruffler sighed; the listeners sighed in sympathy; a general<br/>depression fell upon the company for a moment, for even hardened<br/>outcasts like these are not wholly dead to sentiment, but are able<br/>to feel a fleeting sense of loss and affliction at wide intervals<br/>and under peculiarly favouring circumstances—as in cases like to<br/>this, for instance, when genius and culture depart and leave no<br/>heir. &#160;However, a deep drink all round soon restored the<br/>spirits of the mourners.<br/><br/>"Have any others of our friends fared hardly?" asked Hobbs.<br/><br/>"Some—yes. &#160;Particularly new comers—such as small<br/>husbandmen turned shiftless and hungry upon the world because their<br/>farms were taken from them to be changed to sheep ranges.<br/>&#160;They begged, and were whipped at the cart's tail, naked from<br/>the girdle up, till the blood ran; then set in the stocks to be<br/>pelted; they begged again, were whipped again, and deprived of an<br/>ear; they begged a third time—poor devils, what else could they<br/>do?—and were branded on the cheek with a red-hot iron, then sold<br/>for slaves; they ran away, were hunted down, and hanged. &#160;'Tis<br/>a brief tale, and quickly told. &#160;Others of us have fared less<br/>hardly. Stand forth, Yokel, Burns, and Hodge—show your<br/>adornments!"<br/><br/>These stood up and stripped away some of their rags, exposing<br/>their backs, criss-crossed with ropy old welts left by the lash;<br/>one turned up his hair and showed the place where a left ear had<br/>once been; another showed a brand upon his shoulder—the letter<br/>V—and a mutilated ear; the third said—<br/><br/>"I am Yokel, once a farmer and prosperous, with loving wife and<br/>kids—now am I somewhat different in estate and calling; and the<br/>wife and kids are gone; mayhap they are in heaven, mayhap in—in the<br/>other place—but the kindly God be thanked, they bide no more in<br/>ENGLAND! &#160;My good old blameless mother strove to earn bread by<br/>nursing the sick; one of these died, the doctors knew not how, so<br/>my mother was burnt for a witch, whilst my babes looked on and<br/>wailed. &#160;English law!—up, all, with your cups!—now all<br/>together and with a cheer!—drink to the merciful English law that<br/>delivered HER from the English hell! &#160;Thank you, mates, one<br/>and all. &#160;I begged, from house to house—I and the wife—bearing<br/>with us the hungry kids—but it was crime to be hungry in England—so<br/>they stripped us and lashed us through three towns. &#160;Drink ye<br/>all again to the merciful English law!—for its lash drank deep of<br/>my Mary's blood and its blessed deliverance came quick. &#160;She<br/>lies there, in the potter's field, safe from all harms. &#160;And<br/>the kids—well, whilst the law lashed me from town to town, they<br/>starved. Drink, lads—only a drop—a drop to the poor kids, that<br/>never did any creature harm. &#160;I begged again—begged, for a<br/>crust, and got the stocks and lost an ear—see, here bides the<br/>stump; I begged again, and here is the stump of the other to keep<br/>me minded of it. And still I begged again, and was sold for a<br/>slave—here on my cheek under this stain, if I washed it off, ye<br/>might see the red S the branding-iron left there! &#160;A SLAVE!<br/>&#160;Do you understand that word? &#160;An English SLAVE!—that is<br/>he that stands before ye. &#160;I have run from my master, and when<br/>I am found—the heavy curse of heaven fall on the law of the land<br/>that hath commanded it!—I shall hang!" {1}<br/><br/>A ringing voice came through the murky air—<br/><br/>"Thou shalt NOT!—and this day the end of that law is come!"<br/><br/>All turned, and saw the fantastic figure of the little King<br/>approaching hurriedly; as it emerged into the light and was clearly<br/>revealed, a general explosion of inquiries broke out—<br/><br/>"Who is it? &#160;WHAT is it? &#160;Who art thou, manikin?"<br/><br/>The boy stood unconfused in the midst of all those surprised and<br/>questioning eyes, and answered with princely dignity—<br/><br/>
