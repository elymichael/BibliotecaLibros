After the Duchess's return into her own body, she entertained<br/>her Lord (when he was pleased to hear such kind of Discourses) with<br/>Foreign Relations;&#160;but he was never displeased to hear of the<br/>Empress's kind Commendations, and of the Characters she was pleased<br/>to give of him to the Emperor. Amongst other Relations, she told<br/>him all what had past between the Empress, and the several Monarchs<br/>of that World whither she went with the Empress; and how she had<br/>subdued them to pay Tribute and Homage to the Monarch of that<br/>Nation or Kingdom to which she owed both her Birth and Education.<br/>she also related to her Lord what Magnificent Stables and<br/>Riding-Houses the Emperor had built, and what fine Horses were in<br/>the Blazing-world, of several shapes and sizes, and how exact their<br/>shapes were in each sort, and of many various Colours, and fine<br/>Marks, as if they had been painted by Art, with such Coats or<br/>Skins, that they had a far greater gloss and smoothness than Satin;<br/>and were there but a passage out of the Blazingworld into this,<br/>said she, you should not onely have some of those Horses, but such<br/>Materials as the Emperor has, to build your Stables and<br/>Riding-Houses withall; and so much Gold, that I should never repine<br/>at your Noble and Generous Gifts. The Duke smilingly answered her,<br/>That he was sorry there was no Passage between those two Worlds;<br/>but, said he, I have always found an Obstruction to my Good<br/>Fortunes.<br/><br/>One time the Duchess chanced to discourse with some of her<br/>acquaintance, of the Empress of the Blazing-world, who asked her<br/>what Pastimes and Recreations her Majesty did most delight in? The<br/>Duchess answered, That she spent most of her time in the study of<br/>Natural Causes and Effects, which was her chief delight and<br/>pastime; and that she loved to discourse sometimes with the most<br/>Learned persons of that World: And to please the Emperor and his<br/>Nobles, who were all of the Royal Race, she went often abroad to<br/>take the air, but seldom in the day-time, always at night, if it<br/>might be called Night; for, said she, the Nights there, are as<br/>light as Days, by reason of the numerous Blazing-Starrs, which are<br/>very splendorous, onely their Light is whiter than the Sun's Light;<br/>and as the Sun's Light is hot, so their Light is cool; not so cool<br/>as our twinkling Starr-light, nor is their Sun-light so hot as<br/>ours, but more rate: And that part of the Blazing-world where the<br/>Empress resides, is always clear, and never subject to any Storms,<br/>Tempests, Fogs or Mists, but has onely refreshing-Dews that nourish<br/>the Earth: The air of it is sweet and temperate, and, as I said<br/>before, as much light in the Sun's absence, as in its presence,<br/>which makes that time we call Night, more pleasant there than the<br/>Day: And sometimes the Empress goes abroad by Water in Barges,<br/>sometimes by Land in Chariots, and sometimes on Horse-back; her<br/>Royal&#160;Chariots are very Glorious, the Body is one intire green<br/>Diamond; the four small Pillars that bear up the Top-cover, are<br/>four white Diamonds, cut in the form thereof; the top or roof of<br/>the Chariot, is one intire blew Diamond, and at the four corners<br/>are great springs of Rubies; the Seat is made of Cloth of Gold,<br/>stuffed with Ambergreece beaten small: the Chariot is drawn by<br/>Twelve Unicorns, whose Trappings are all Chains of Pearl; and as<br/>for her Barges, they are onely of Gold. Her Guard of State (for she<br/>needs none for security, there being no Rebels or Enemies) consists<br/>of Giants, but they seldom wait on their Majesties abroad, because<br/>their extraordinary height and bigness does hinder their prospect.<br/>Her Entertainment when she is upon the Water, is the Musick of the<br/>Fish- and Bird-men; and by Land are Horse and Foot-matches; for the<br/>Empress takes much delight in making Race-matches with the Emperor,<br/>and the Nobility; some Races are between the Fox- and Ape-men,<br/>which sometimes the Satyrs strive to outrun; and some are between<br/>the Spider-men and Licemen. Also there are several Flight-matches,<br/>between the several sorts of Bird-men, and the several sorts of<br/>Fly-men; and swimming-matches, between the several sorts of<br/>Fish-men. The Emperor, Empress, and their Nobles, take also great<br/>delight to have Collations; for in the Blazing-world, there are<br/>most delicious Fruits of all sorts, and some such as in<br/>this&#160;World were never seen nor tasted; for there are most<br/>tempting sorts of Fruit: After their Collations are ended, they<br/>Dance; and if they be upon the Water, they dance upon the Water,<br/>there lying so many Fish-men so close and thick together, as they<br/>can dance very evenly and easily upon their backs, and need not<br/>fear drowning. Their Musick, both Vocal and Instrumental, is<br/>according to their several places: Upon the Water, it is of<br/>Water-Instruments, as shells filled with Water, and so moved by<br/>Art, which is a very sweet and delightful harmony; and those Dances<br/>which they dance upon the Water, are, for the most part, such as we<br/>in this World call swimming- Dances, where they do not lift up<br/>their feet high: In Lawns, or upon Plains, they have<br/>Wind-Instruments, but much better than those in our World: And when<br/>they dance in the Woods, they have Horn-Instruments, which although<br/>they are of a sort of Wind-Instruments, yet they are of another<br/>Fashion than the former: In their Houses they have such Instruments<br/>as are somewhat like our Viols, Violins, Theorboes, Lutes,<br/>Citherins, Gittars, Harpsichords, and the like; but yet so far<br/>beyond them, that the difference cannot well be exprest; and as<br/>their places of Dancing, and their Musick is different, so is their<br/>manner or way of Dancing. In these and the like Recreations, the<br/>Emperor, Empress, and the Nobility pass their time.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
