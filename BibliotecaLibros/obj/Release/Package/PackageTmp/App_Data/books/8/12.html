<br/>After this they took another subject, and one propounded this<br/>Syllogism: Every Philosopher is wise: Every Beast is wise,<br/>Therefore every Beast is a Philosopher.<br/><br/>But another said that this Argument was false, therefore he<br/>contradicted him with a Syllogism of the second Figure of the<br/>fourth Mode, thus: Every Philosopher is wise: some Beasts are not<br/>wise, Therefore some Beasts are not Philosophers.<br/><br/>Thus they argued, and intended to go on, but the Empress<br/>interrupted them: I have enough, said she, of your chopt Logick,<br/>and will hear no more of your Syllogisms; for it disorders my<br/>Reason, and puts my Brain on the rack; your formal argumentations<br/>are able to spoil all natural wit; and I'le have you to consider,<br/>that Art does not make Reason, but Reason makes Art; and therefore<br/>as much as Reason is above Art, so much is a natural rational<br/>discourse to be preferred before an artificial: for Art is, for the<br/>most part irregular, and disorders Men's understandings more then<br/>it rectifies&#160;them, and leads them into a Labyrinth where<br/>they'l never get out, and makes them dull and unfit for useful<br/>employments; especially your Art of Logick, which consists onely in<br/>contradicting each other, in making sophismes, and obscuring Truth,<br/>instead of clearing it.<br/><br/>But they replied to her Majesty, That the knowledg of Nature,<br/>that is, Natural Philosophy, would be imperfect without the Art of<br/>Logick; and that there was an improbable Truth which could no<br/>otherwise be found out then by the Art of disputing. Truly, said<br/>the Empress, I do believe that it is with Natural Philosophy, as it<br/>is with all other effects of Nature; for no particular knowledg can<br/>be perfect, by reason knowledg is dividable, as well as composable;<br/>nay, to speak properly, Nature her self cannot boast of any<br/>perfection, but God himself; because there are so many irregular<br/>motions in Nature, and 'tis but a folly to think that Art should be<br/>able to regulate them, since Art it self is, for the most part,<br/>irregular. But as for Improbable Truth I know not what your meaning<br/>is; for Truth is more then Improbability: nay, there is so much<br/>difference between Truth and Improbability, that I cannot conceive<br/>it possible how they can be joined together. In short, said she, I<br/>do no ways approve of your Profession; and though I will not<br/>dissolve your society, yet I shall never take delight in hearing<br/>you any more; wherefore confine your disputations to your<br/>Schools,&#160;lest besides the Commonwealth of Learning, they<br/>disturb also Divinity and Policy, Religion and Laws, and by that<br/>means draw an utter ruine and destruction both upon Church and<br/>State.<br/><br/>After the Empress had thus finish'd the Discourses and<br/>Conferences with the mentioned societies of her Vertuoso's, she<br/>considered by her self the manner of their Religion, and finding it<br/>very defective, was troubled, that so wise and knowing a people<br/>should have no more knowledg of the Divine Truth; Wherefore she<br/>consulted with her own thoughts, whether it was possible to convert<br/>them all to her own Religion, and to that end she resolved to build<br/>Churches, and make also up a Congregation of Women, whereof she<br/>intended to be the head her self, and to instruct them in the<br/>several points of her Religion. This she had no sooner begun, but<br/>the Women, which generally had quick wits, subtile conceptions,<br/>clear understandings, and solid judgments, became, in a short time,<br/>very devout and zealous Sisters; for the Empress had an excellent<br/>gift of Preaching, and instructing them in the Articles of Faith;<br/>and by that means, she converted them not onely soon, but gained an<br/>extraordinary love of all her Subjects throughout that World. But<br/>at last, pondering with her self the inconstant nature of Mankind,<br/>and fearing that in time they would grow weary, and desert the<br/>divine Truth, following their own fancies, and living according to<br/>their own desires; she began to&#160;be troubled that her labours<br/>and pains should prove of so little effect, and therefore studied<br/>all manner of ways to prevent it. Amongst the rest, she call'd to<br/>mind a Relation which the Bird-men made her once, of a Mountain<br/>that did burn in flames of fire; and thereupon did immediately send<br/>for the wisest and subtilest of her Worm-men, commanding them to<br/>discover the cause of the Eruption of that same fire; which they<br/>did; and having dived to the very bottom of the Mountain, informed<br/>her Majesty, That there was a certain sort of Stone, whose nature<br/>was such, that being wetted, it would grow excessively hot, and<br/>break forth into a flaming-fire, until it became dry, and then it<br/>ceased from burning. The Empress was glad to hear this news, and<br/>forthwith desired the Worm men to bring her some of that Stone, but<br/>be sure to keep it secret: she sent also for the Bird-men, and<br/>asked them whether they could not get her a piece of the Sun-<br/>stone? They answered, That it was impossible, unless they did spoil<br/>or lessen the light of the World: but, said they, if it please your<br/>Majesty, we can demolish one of the numerous Stars of the Sky,<br/>which the World will never miss.<br/><br/>The Empress was very well satisfied with this proposal, and<br/>having thus imployed these two sorts of men, in the mean while<br/>builded two Chappels one above another; the one she lined<br/>throughout with Diamonds, both Roof, Walls and Pillars; but the<br/>other&#160;she resolved to line with the Star-stone; the Fire-<br/>stone she placed upon the Diamond-lining, by reason Fire has no<br/>power on Diamonds; and when she would have that Chappel where the<br/>Fire-stone was, appear all in flame, she had by the means of<br/>Artificial pipes, water conveighed into it, which by turning the<br/>Cock, did, as out of a Fountain, spring over all the room, and as<br/>long as the Fire-stone was wet, the Chappel seemed to be all in a<br/>flaming-fire.<br/><br/>The other Chappel, which was lined with the Star- stone, did<br/>onely cast a splendorous and comfortable light; both the Chappels<br/>stood upon Pillars, just in the middle of a round Cloyster, which<br/>was dark as night; neither was there any other light within them,<br/>but what came from the Fire- and Star-stone; and being every where<br/>open, allowed to all that were within the compass of the Cloyster,<br/>a free prospect into them; besides, they were so artificially<br/>contrived, that they did both move in a Circle about their own<br/>Centres, without intermission, contrary ways. In the Chappel which<br/>was lined with the Fire-stone, the Empress preached Sermons of<br/>Terror to the wicked, and told them of the punishments for their<br/>sins, to wit, That after this life they should be tormented in an<br/>everlasting Fire. But in the other Chappel lined with the Star-<br/>stone, she preached Sermons of Comfort to those that repented of<br/>their sins, and were troubled at their own wickedness: Neither did<br/>the heat of the flame in the&#160;least hinder her; for the<br/>Fire-stone did not cast so great a heat but the Empress was able to<br/>endure it, by reason the water which was poured on the Stone, by<br/>its own self-motion turned into a flaming-fire, occasioned by the<br/>natural motions of the Stone, which made the flame weaker then if<br/>it had been fed by some other kind of fuel; the other Chappel where<br/>the Star-Stone was, although it did cast a great light, yet was it<br/>without all heat, and the Empress appear'd like an Angel in it; and<br/>as that Chappel was an embleme of Hell, so this was an embleme of<br/>Heaven. And thus the Empress, by Art, and her own Ingenuity, did<br/>not onely convert the Blazing-World to her own Religion, but kept<br/>them in a constant belief, without inforcement or blood-shed; for<br/>she knew well, that belief was a thing not to be forced or pressed<br/>upon the people, but to be instilled into their minds by gentle<br/>perswasions; and after this manner she encouraged them also in all<br/>other duties and employments: for Fear, though it makes people<br/>obey, yet does it not last so long, nor is it so sure a means to<br/>keep them to their duties, as Love.<br/><br/>Last of all, when she saw that both Church and State now in a<br/>well-ordered and setled condition, her thoughts reflected upon the<br/>World she came from; and though she had a great desire to know the<br/>condition of the same, yet could she advise no manner of way how to<br/>gain any knowledg thereof; at last, after many serious<br/>considerations, she conceived that it was impossible to&#160;be<br/>done by any other means, then by the help of Immaterial Spirits;<br/>wherefore she made a Convocation of the most learned, witty and<br/>ingenious of all the forementioned sorts of Men, and desired to<br/>know of them, whether there were any Immaterial Spirits in their<br/>World. First, she enquired of the Worm-men, whether they had<br/>perceived some within the Earth? They answered her Majesty, That<br/>they never knew of any such Creatures; for whatsoever did dwell<br/>within the Earth, said they, was imbodied and material. Then she<br/>asked the Fly-men, whether they had observed any in the Air? for<br/>you having numerous Eyes, said she, will be more able to perceive<br/>them, than any other Creatures. To which they answered her Majesty,<br/>That although Spirits, being immaterial, could not be perceived by<br/>the Worm-men in the Earth, yet they perceived that such Creatures<br/>did lodg in the Vehicles of the Air. Then the Empress asked,<br/>Whether they could speak to them, and whether they did understand<br/>each other? The Fly-men answered, That those Spirits were always<br/>cloth'd in some sort or other of Material Garments; which Garments<br/>were their Bodies, made, for the most part, of Air; and when<br/>occasion served, they could put on any other sort of substances;<br/>but yet they could not put these substances into any form or shape,<br/>as they pleased. The Empress asked the Fly-men, whether it was<br/>possible that she could be acquainted, and have some conferences<br/>with them?<br/><br/>They answered, They did verily believe she might. Hereupon the<br/>Empress commanded the Fly-men to ask some of the Spirits, Whether<br/>they would be pleased to give her a Visit? This they did; and after<br/>the Spirits had presented themselves to the Empress, (in what<br/>shapes and forms, I cannot exactly tell) after some few Complements<br/>that passed between them, the Empress told the Spirits that she<br/>questioned not, but they did know how she was a stranger in that<br/>World, and by what miraculous means she was arrived there; and<br/>since she had a great desire to know the condition of the World she<br/>came from, her request to the Spirits was, To give her some<br/>Information thereof, especially of those parts of the World where<br/>she was born, bred, and educated; as also of her particular friends<br/>and acquaintance: all which, the Spirits did according to her<br/>desire. At last, after a great many conferences and particular<br/>intelligences, which the Spirits gave the Empress, to her great<br/>satisfaction and content; she enquired after the most famous<br/>Students, Writers, and Experimental Philosophers in that World,<br/>which they gave her full relation of: amongst the rest she<br/>enquired, Whether there were none that had found out yet the Jews<br/>Cabbala? Several have endeavoured it, answered the Spirits, but<br/>those that came nearest (although themselves denied it) were one<br/>Dr. Dee, and one Edward Kelly, the one representing Moses, and the<br/>other Aaron; for Kelly was to Dr.Dee, as Aaron to Moses;&#160;but<br/>yet they proved at last but meer Cheats; and were described by one<br/>of their own Country-men, a famous Poet, named Ben. Johnson, in a<br/>Play call'd,The Alchymist, where he expressed Kelly by Capt. Face,<br/>and Dee by Dr. Subtle, and their two Wives by Doll Common, and the<br/>Widow; by the Spaniard the Play, he meant the Spanish Ambassador,<br/>and by Sir Epicure Mammon, a Polish Lord. The Empress remembred<br/>that she had seen the Play, and asked the Spirits, whom he meant by<br/>the name of Ananias? some Zealous Brethren, answered they, in<br/>Holland, Germany, and several other places. Then she asked them,<br/>Who was meant by the Druggist? Truly, answered the Spirits, We have<br/>forgot, it being so long since it was made and acted. What, replied<br/>the Empress, Can Spirits forget? Yes, said the Spirits; for what is<br/>past, is onely kept in memory, if it be not recorded. I did<br/>believe, said the Empress, That Spirits had no need of Memory, or<br/>Remembrance, and could not be subject to Forgetfulness. How can we,<br/>answered they, give an account of things present, if we had no<br/>Memory, but especially of things past, unrecorded, if we had no<br/>Remembrance? said the Empress, By present Knowledg and<br/>Understanding. The Spirits answered, That present Knowledg and<br/>Understanding was of actions or things present, not of past. But,<br/>said the Empress, you know what is to come, without Memory or<br/>Remembrance; and therefore you may know&#160;what is past without<br/>memory and remembrance. They answered, That their foreknowledg was<br/>onely a prudent and subtile Observation made by comparing of things<br/>or actions past, with those that are present; and that Remembrance<br/>was nothing else but a Repetition of things or actions past.<br/><br/>Then the Empress asked the Spirits, Whether there was a<br/>threefold Cabbala? They answered, Dee and Kelly made but a two-fold<br/>Cabbala, to wit, of the Old and New Testament, but others might not<br/>onely make two or three, but threescore Cabbala's, if they pleased.<br/>The Empress asked, Whether it was a Traditional, or meerly a<br/>Scriptural, or whether it was a Literal, Philosophical, or Moral<br/>Cabbala some, answered they, did believe it meerly Traditional,<br/>others Scriptural, some Literal, and some Metaphorical: but the<br/>truth is, said they, 'twas partly one, and partly the other; as<br/>partly a Traditional, partly a Scriptural, partly Literal, partly<br/>Metaphorical. The Empress asked further, Whether the Cabbala was a<br/>work onely of Natural Reason, or of Divine Inspiration? Many, said<br/>the Spirits, that write Cabbala's pretend to Divine Inspirations;<br/>but whether it be so, or not, it does not belong to us to judg;<br/>onely this we must needs confess, that it is a work which requires<br/>a good wit, and a strong Faith, but not Natural Reason; for though<br/>Natural Reason is most perswasive, yet Faith is the chief that is<br/>required in Cabbalists. But, said the Empress,&#160;Is there not<br/>Divine Reason, as well as there is Natural? No, answered they: for<br/>there is but a Divine Faith, and as for Reason it is onely Natural;<br/>but you Mortals are so puzled about this Divine Faith, and Natural<br/>Reason, that you do not know well how to distinguish them, but<br/>confound them both, which is the cause you have so many divine<br/>Philosophers who make a Gallimafry both of Reason and Faith. Then<br/>she asked, Whether pure Natural Philosophers were Cabbalists? They<br/>answered, No; but onely your Mystical or Divine Philosophers, such<br/>as study beyond Sense and Reason. she enquired further, Whether<br/>there was any Cabbala in God, or whether God was full of Idea's?<br/>They answered, There could be nothing in God, nor could God be full<br/>of any thing, either forms or figures, but of himself; for God is<br/>the Perfection of all things, and an Unexpressible Being, beyond<br/>the conception of any Creature, either Natural or Supernatural.<br/>Then I pray inform me, said the Empress, Whether the Jews Cabbala<br/>or any other, consist in Numbers? The Spirits answered, No: for<br/>Numbers are odd, and different, and would make a disagreement in<br/>the Cabbala. But, said she again, Is it a sin then not to know or<br/>understand the Cabbala? God is so merciful, answered they, and so<br/>just, that he will never damn the ignorant, and save onely those<br/>that pretend to know him and his secret Counsels by their<br/>Cabbala's; but he loves those that adore and&#160;worship him with<br/>fear and reverence, and with a pure heart. she asked further, which<br/>of these two Cabbala's was most approved, the Natural, or<br/>Theological? The Theological, answered they, is mystical, and<br/>belongs onely to Faith; but the Natural belongs to Reason. Then she<br/>asked them, Whether Divine Faith was made out of Reason? No<br/>answered they, for Faith proceeds onely from a Divine saving Grace,<br/>which is a peculiar Gift of God. How comes it then, replied she,<br/>that Men, even those that are of several opinions, have Faith more<br/>or less? A Natural Belief, answered they, is not a Divine Faith.<br/>But, proceeded the Empress, How are you sure that God cannot be<br/>known? The several Opinions you Mortals have of God, answered they,<br/>are sufficient witnesses thereof. Well then, replied the Empress,<br/>leaving this inquisitive knowledg of God, I pray inform me, whether<br/>you Spirits give motion to Natural Bodies? No, answered they; but,<br/>on the contrary, Natural material bodies give Spirits motion; for<br/>we Spirits, being incorporeal, have no motion but from our<br/>Corporeal Vehicles, so that we move by the help of our Bodies, and<br/>not the Bodies by our help; for pure Spirits are immovable. If this<br/>be so, replied the Empress, How comes it then that you can move so<br/>suddenly at a vast distance? They answered, That some sorts of<br/>matter were more pure, rare, and consequently more light and agil<br/>then others; and this was the reason&#160;for their quick and<br/>sudden motions. Then the Empress asked them, Whether they could<br/>speak without a body, or bodily organs? No, said they; nor could we<br/>have any bodily sense, but onely knowledg. she asked, Whether they<br/>could have Knowledg without Body? Not a Natural, answered they, but<br/>a Supernatural Knowledg, which is a far better Knowledg then a<br/>Natural. Then she asked them, Whether they had a General or<br/>Universal Knowledg? They answered, Single or particular created<br/>Spirits, have not; for not any Creature, but God Himself, can have<br/>an absolute and perfect knowledg of all things. The Empress asked<br/>them further, Whether Spirits had inward and outward parts? No,<br/>answered they; for parts onely belong to bodies, not to Spirits.<br/>Again, she asked them, Whether their Vehicles were living Bodies?<br/>They are Self-moving Bodies, answered they, and therefore they must<br/>needs be living; for nothing can move it self, without it hath<br/>life. Then, said she, it must necessarily follow, that this living,<br/>Self-moving Body gives motion to the Spirit, and not the Spirit<br/>motion to the Body, as its Vehicle. You say very true, answered<br/>they, and we told you this before. Then the Empress asked them, Of<br/>what forms of Matter those Vehicles were? They said they were of<br/>several different forms; some gross and dense, and others more<br/>pure, rare, and subtil. If you be not Material, said the Empress,<br/>how can you be Generators of all Creatures? We are no&#160;more,<br/>answered they, the Generators of material Creatures, then they are<br/>the Generators of us Spirits. Then she asked, Whether they did<br/>leave their Vehicles? No, answered they; for we being incorporeal,<br/>cannot leave or quit them: but our Vehicles do change into several<br/>forms and figures, according as occasion requires. Then the Empress<br/>desired the Spirits to tell her, Whether Man was a little World?<br/>They answered, That if a Fly or Worm was a little World, then Man<br/>was so too. she asked again, Whether our Fore-fathers had been as<br/>wise, as Men were at present, and had understood sense and reason,<br/>as well as they did now? They answered, That in former Ages they<br/>had been as wise as they are in this present, nay, wiser; for, said<br/>they, many in this age do think their Fore-fathers have been Fools,<br/>by which they prove themselves to be such. The Empress asked<br/>further, Whether there was any Plastick power in Nature? Truly,<br/>said the Spirits, Plastick power is a hard word, &amp; signifies no<br/>more then the power of the corporeal, figurative motions of Nature.<br/>After this, the Empress desired the Spirits to inform her where the<br/>Paradise was, Whether it was in the midst of the World as a Centre<br/>of pleasure? or, Whether it was the whole World; or a peculiar<br/>World by it self, as a World of Life, and not of Matter; or whether<br/>it was mixt, as a world of living animal Creatures? They answered,<br/>That Paradise was not in the world she came from, but in that world<br/>she lived in at present; and&#160;that it was the very same place<br/>where she kept her Court, and where her Palace stood, in the midst<br/>of the Imperial City. The Empress asked further, Whether in the<br/>beginning and Creation of the World, all Beasts could speak? They<br/>answered, That no Beasts could speak, but onely those sorts of<br/>Creatures which were Fish-men, Bear-men, Worm-men, and the like,<br/>which could speak in the first Age, as well as they do now. she<br/>asked again, Whether they were none of those Spirits that frighted<br/>Adam out of the Paradise, at least caused him not to return thither<br/>again? They an? swered they were not. Then she desired to be<br/>informed, whither Adam fled when he was driven out of the Paradise?<br/>Out of this World, said they, you are now Empress of, into the<br/>World you came from. If this be so, replied the Empress, then<br/>surely those Cabbalists are much out of their story, who believe<br/>the Paradise to be a world of Life onely, without Matter, for this<br/>world, though it be most pleasant and fruitful, yet it is not a<br/>world of meer Immaterial life, but a world of living, Material<br/>Creatures. Without question, they are, answered the Spirits; for<br/>not all Cabbala's are true. Then the Empress asked, That since it<br/>is mentioned in the story of the Creation of the World, that Eve<br/>was tempted by the Serpent, Whether the Devil was within the<br/>Serpent, or, Whether the Serpent tempted her without the Devil?<br/>They answered, That the Devil was within the Serpent. But how came<br/>it then,&#160;replied she, that the Serpent was cursed? They<br/>answered, because the Devil was in him; for are not those men in<br/>danger of damnation which have the Devil within them, who perswades<br/>them to believe and act wickedly? The Empress asked further,<br/>Whether Light and the Heavens were all one? They answered, That<br/>that Region which contains the Lucid natural Orbs, was by Mortals<br/>named Heaven; but the Beatifical Heaven, which is the Habitation of<br/>the Blessed Angels and Souls, was so far beyond it, that it could<br/>not be compared to any Natural Creature. Then the Empress asked<br/>them, Whether all Matter was fluid at first? They answered, That<br/>Matter was always as it is, and that some parts of Matter were<br/>rare, some dense, some fluid, some solid, &amp;c. Neither was God<br/>bound to make all Matter fluid at first. she asked further, Whether<br/>Matter was immovable in it self? We have answered you before, said<br/>they, That there is no motion but in Matter; and were it not for<br/>the motion of Matter, we Spirits, could not move, nor give you any<br/>answer to your several questions. After this, the Empress asked the<br/>Spirits, Whether the Universe was made within the space of six<br/>days, or, Whether by those six days, were meant so many Decrees or<br/>Commands of God? They answered her, That the World was made by the<br/>All-powerful Decree and Command of God; but whether there were six<br/>Decrees or Commands, or fewer, or more, no Creature was able to<br/>tell.<br/><br/>
