To The Duchesse of Newcastle, On Her New
Blazing-World.



Our Elder World, with all their Skill and Arts,

Could but divide the World into three Parts:

Columbus, then for Navigation fam'd,

Found a new World, America 'tis nam'd;

Now this new World was found, it was not made,

Onely discovered, lying in Time's shade.

Then what are You, having no Chaos found

To make a World, or any such least ground?
