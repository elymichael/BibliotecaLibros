<br/><br/><br/>To all Noble and Worthy Ladies.<br/><br/><br/>This present&#160;<br/>Description of a New World<br/>, was made<br/>as an Appendix to my&#160;<br/>Observations upon Experimental<br/>Philosophy;<br/>&#160;and, having some Sympathy and Coherence with<br/>each other, were joyned together as Two several Worlds, at their<br/>Two Poles. But, by reason most Ladies take no delight in<br/>Philosophical Arguments, I separated some from the mentioned<br/>Observations, and caused them to go out by themselves, that I might<br/>express my Respects, in presenting to Them such Fancies as my<br/>Contemplations did afford. The First Part is Romancical; the<br/>Second, Philosophical; and the Third is meerly Fancy; or (as I may<br/>call it) Fantastical. And if (Noble Ladies)you should chance to<br/>take pleasure in reading these Fancies, I shall account my self a<br/>Happy Creatoress: If not, I must be content to live a Melancholly<br/>Life in my own World; which I cannot call a Poor World, if Poverty<br/>be only want of Gold, and Jewels: for, there is more Gold in it,<br/>than all the Chymists ever made; or, (as I verily believe) will<br/>ever be able to make. As for the Rocks of Diamonds, I wish, with<br/>all my Soul, they might be shared amongst my Noble Female Friends;<br/>upon which condition, I would willingly quit my Part: And of the<br/>Gold, I should desire only so much as might suffice to repair my<br/>Noble Lord and Husband's Losses: for, I am not Covetous, but as<br/>Ambitious as ever any of my Sex was, is, or can be; which is the<br/>cause, That though I cannot be Henry the Fifth, or Charles the<br/>Second; yet, I will endeavour to be, Margaret the First: and,<br/>though I have neither Power, Time nor Occasion, to be a great<br/>Conqueror, like Alexander, or Cesar; yet, rather than not be<br/>Mistress of a World, since Fortune and the Fates would give me<br/>none, I have made One of my own. And thus, believing, or, at least,<br/>hoping, that no Creature can, or will, Envy me for this World of<br/>mine, I remain,<br/><br/>Noble Ladies, Your Humble Servant, M.<br/>Newcastle.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
