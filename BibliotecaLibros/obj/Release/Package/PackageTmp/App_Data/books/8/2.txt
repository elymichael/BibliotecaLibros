About Cavendish:

Margaret Cavendish, Duchess of Newcastle-upon-Tyne was an
English aristocrat, a prolific writer, and a scientist. Her writing
addressed a number of topics, including gender, power, manners,
scientific method, and philosophy. Her utopian romance, The Blazing
World, is one of the earliest examples of science fiction. She is
singular in having published extensively in natural philosophy and
early modern science. She published over a dozen original works;
inclusion of her revised works brings her total number of
publications to twenty one.
