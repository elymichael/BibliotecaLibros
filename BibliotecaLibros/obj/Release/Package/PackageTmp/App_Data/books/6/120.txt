"What's happening down there?" asked Pencroft, examining the
surface of the lake.

"Top smells some amphibious creature," replied Herbert.

"An alligator, perhaps," said the reporter.

"I do not think so," replied Harding. "Alligators are only met
with in regions less elevated in latitude."

Meanwhile Top had returned at his master's call, and had
regained the shore: but he could not stay quiet; he plunged in
among the tall grass, and guided by instinct, he appeared to follow
some invisible being which was slipping along under the surface of
the water. However the water was calm; not a ripple disturbed its
surface. Several times the settlers stopped on the bank, and
observed it attentively. Nothing appeared. There was some mystery
there.

The engineer was puzzled.

"Let us pursue this exploration to the end," said he.

Half an hour after they had all arrived at the southeast angle
of the lake, on Prospect Heights. At this point the examination of
the banks of the lake was considered finished, and yet the engineer
had not been able to discover how and where the waters were
discharged. "There is no doubt this overflow exists," he repeated,
and since it is not visible it must go through the granite cliff at
the west!"

"But what importance do you attach to knowing that, my dear
Cyrus?" asked Gideon Spilett.

"Considerable importance," replied the engineer; "for if it
flows through the cliff there is probably some cavity, which it
would be easy to render habitable after turning away the
water."
