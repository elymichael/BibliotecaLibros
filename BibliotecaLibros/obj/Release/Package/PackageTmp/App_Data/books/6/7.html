Whence, it may be asked, had come that plaything of the tempest?<br/>From what part of the world did it rise? It surely could not have<br/>started during the storm. But the storm had raged five days<br/>already, and the first symptoms were manifested on the 18th. It<br/>cannot be doubted that the balloon came from a great distance, for<br/>it could not have traveled less than two thousand miles in<br/>twenty-four hours.<br/><br/>At any rate the passengers, destitute of all marks for their<br/>guidance, could not have possessed the means of reckoning the route<br/>traversed since their departure. It was a remarkable fact that,<br/>although in the very midst of the furious tempest, they did not<br/>suffer from it. They were thrown about and whirled round and round<br/>without feeling the rotation in the slightest degree, or being<br/>sensible that they were removed from a horizontal position.<br/><br/>Their eyes could not pierce through the thick mist which had<br/>gathered beneath the car. Dark vapor was all around them. Such was<br/>the density of the atmosphere that they could not be certain<br/>whether it was day or night. No reflection of light, no sound from<br/>inhabited land, no roaring of the ocean could have reached them,<br/>through the obscurity, while suspended in those elevated zones.<br/>Their rapid descent alone had informed them of the dangers which<br/>they ran from the waves. However, the balloon, lightened of heavy<br/>articles, such as ammunition, arms, and provisions, had risen into<br/>the higher layers of the atmosphere, to a height of 4,500 feet. The<br/>voyagers, after having discovered that the sea extended beneath<br/>them, and thinking the dangers above less dreadful than those<br/>below, did not hesitate to throw overboard even their most useful<br/>articles, while they endeavored to lose no more of that fluid, the<br/>life of their enterprise, which sustained them above the abyss.<br/><br/>The night passed in the midst of alarms which would have been<br/>death to less energetic souls. Again the day appeared and with it<br/>the tempest began to moderate. From the beginning of that day, the<br/>24th of March, it showed symptoms of abating. At dawn, some of the<br/>lighter clouds had risen into the more lofty regions of the air. In<br/>a few hours the wind had changed from a hurricane to a fresh<br/>breeze, that is to say, the rate of the transit of the atmospheric<br/>layers was diminished by half. It was still what sailors call "a<br/>close-reefed topsail breeze," but the commotion in the elements had<br/>none the less considerably diminished.<br/><br/>Towards eleven o'clock, the lower region of the air was sensibly<br/>clearer. The atmosphere threw off that chilly dampness which is<br/>felt after the passage of a great meteor. The storm did not seem to<br/>have gone farther to the west. It appeared to have exhausted<br/>itself. Could it have passed away in electric sheets, as is<br/>sometimes the case with regard to the typhoons of the Indian<br/>Ocean?<br/><br/>But at the same time, it was also evident that the balloon was<br/>again slowly descending with a regular movement. It appeared as if<br/>it were, little by little, collapsing, and that its case was<br/>lengthening and extending, passing from a spherical to an oval<br/>form. Towards midday the balloon was hovering above the sea at a<br/>height of only 2,000 feet. It contained 50,000 cubic feet of gas,<br/>and, thanks to its capacity, it could maintain itself a long time<br/>in the air, although it should reach a great altitude or might be<br/>thrown into a horizontal position.<br/><br/>Perceiving their danger, the passengers cast away the last<br/>articles which still weighed down the car, the few provisions they<br/>had kept, everything, even to their pocket-knives, and one of them,<br/>having hoisted himself on to the circles which united the cords of<br/>the net, tried to secure more firmly the lower point of the<br/>balloon.<br/><br/>It was, however, evident to the voyagers that the gas was<br/>failing, and that the balloon could no longer be sustained in the<br/>higher regions. They must infallibly perish!<br/><br/>There was not a continent, nor even an island, visible beneath<br/>them. The watery expanse did not present a single speck of land,<br/>not a solid surface upon which their anchor could hold.<br/><br/>It was the open sea, whose waves were still dashing with<br/>tremendous violence! It was the ocean, without any visible limits,<br/>even for those whose gaze, from their commanding position, extended<br/>over a radius of forty miles. The vast liquid plain, lashed without<br/>mercy by the storm, appeared as if covered with herds of furious<br/>chargers, whose white and disheveled crests were streaming in the<br/>wind. No land was in sight, not a solitary ship could be seen. It<br/>was necessary at any cost to arrest their downward course, and to<br/>prevent the balloon from being engulfed in the waves. The voyagers<br/>directed all their energies to this urgent work. But,<br/>notwithstanding their efforts, the balloon still fell, and at the<br/>same time shifted with the greatest rapidity, following the<br/>direction of the wind, that is to say, from the northeast to the<br/>southwest.<br/><br/>Frightful indeed was the situation of these unfortunate men.<br/>They were evidently no longer masters of the machine. All their<br/>attempts were useless. The case of the balloon collapsed more and<br/>more. The gas escaped without any possibility of retaining it.<br/>Their descent was visibly accelerated, and soon after midday the<br/>car hung within 600 feet of the ocean.<br/>
