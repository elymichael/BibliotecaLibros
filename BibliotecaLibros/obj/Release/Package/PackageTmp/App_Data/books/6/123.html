<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>17<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>The next day, the 7th of May, Harding and Gideon Spilett,<br/>leaving Neb to prepare breakfast, climbed Prospect Heights, while<br/>Herbert and Pencroft ascended by the river, to renew their store of<br/>wood.<br/><br/>The engineer and the reporter soon reached the little beach on<br/>which the dugong had been stranded. Already flocks of birds had<br/>attacked the mass of flesh, and had to be driven away with stones,<br/>for Cyrus wished to keep the fat for the use of the colony. As to<br/>the animal's flesh it would furnish excellent food, for in the<br/>islands of the Malay Archipelago and elsewhere, it is especially<br/>reserved for the table of the native princes. But that was Neb's<br/>affair.<br/><br/>At this moment Cyrus Harding had other thoughts. He was much<br/>interested in the incident of the day before. He wished to<br/>penetrate the mystery of that submarine combat, and to ascertain<br/>what monster could have given the dugong so strange a wound. He<br/>remained at the edge of the lake, looking, observing; but nothing<br/>appeared under the tranquil waters, which sparkled in the first<br/>rays of the rising sun.<br/><br/>At the beach, on which lay the body of the dugong, the water was<br/>tolerably shallow, but from this point the bottom of the lake<br/>sloped gradually, and it was probable that the depth was<br/>considerable in the center. The lake might be considered as a large<br/>center basin, which was filled by the water from the Red Creek.<br/><br/>"Well, Cyrus," said the reporter, "there seems to be nothing<br/>suspicious in this water."<br/><br/>"No, my dear Spilett," replied the engineer, "and I really do<br/>not know how to account for the incident of yesterday."<br/><br/>
