"Will you let me try?" said the boy, and very cleverly, without
breaking it, he managed to draw out the wretched yet precious
little bit of wood which was of such great importance to these poor
men. It was unused.

"Hurrah!" cried Pencroft; "it is as good as having a whole
cargo!" He took the match, and, followed by his companions, entered
the cave.

This small piece of wood, of which so many in an inhabited
country are wasted with indifference and are of no value, must here
be used with the greatest caution.

The sailor first made sure that it was quite dry; that done, "We
must have some paper," said he.

"Here," replied Spilett, after some hesitation tearing a leaf
out of his note-book.

Pencroft took the piece of paper which the reporter held out to
him, and knelt down before the fireplace. Some handfuls of grass,
leaves, and dry moss were placed under the fagots and disposed in
such a way that the air could easily circulate, and the dry wood
would rapidly catch fire.

Pencroft then twisted the piece of paper into the shape of a
cone, as smokers do in a high wind, and poked it in among the moss.
Taking a small, rough stone, he wiped it carefully, and with a
beating heart, holding his breath, he gently rubbed the match. The
first attempt did not produce any effect. Pencroft had not struck
hard enough, fearing to rub off the phosphorus.

"No, I can't do it," said he, "my hand trembles, the match has
missed fire; I cannot, I will not!" and rising, he told Herbert to
take his place.

Certainly the boy had never in all his life been so nervous.
Prometheus going to steal the fire from heaven could not have been
more anxious. He did not hesitate, however, but struck the match
directly.

A little spluttering was heard and a tiny blue flame sprang up,
making a choking smoke. Herbert quickly turned the match so as to
augment the flame, and then slipped it into the paper cone, which
in a few seconds too caught fire, and then the moss.

A minute later the dry wood crackled and a cheerful flame,
assisted by the vigorous blowing of the sailor, sprang up in the
midst of the darkness.
