"But is it not possible, captain, that the water flows away at
the bottom of the lake," said Herbert, "and that it reaches the sea
by some subterranean passage?"

"That might be," replied the engineer, "and should it be so we
shall be obliged to build our house ourselves, since nature has not
done it for us."

The colonists were about to begin to traverse the plateau to
return to the Chimneys, when Top gave new signs of agitation. He
barked with fury, and before his master could restrain him, he had
plunged a second time into the lake.

All ran towards the bank. The dog was already more than twenty
feet off, and Cyrus was calling him back, when an enormous head
emerged from the water, which did not appear to be deep in that
place.

Herbert recognized directly the species of amphibian to which
the tapering head, with large eyes, and adorned with long silky
mustaches, belonged.

"A lamantin!" he cried.

It was not a lamantin, but one of that species of the order of
cetaceans, which bear the name of the "dugong," for its nostrils
were open at the upper part of its snout. The enormous animal
rushed on the dog, who tried to escape by returning towards the
shore. His master could do nothing to save him, and before Gideon
Spilett or Herbert thought of bending their bows, Top, seized by
the dugong, had disappeared beneath the water.

Neb, his iron-tipped spear in his hand, wished to go to Top's
help, and attack the dangerous animal in its own element.

"No, Neb," said the engineer, restraining his courageous
servant.

Meanwhile, a struggle was going on beneath the water, an
inexplicable struggle, for in his situation Top could not possibly
resist; and judging by the bubbling of the surface it must be also
a terrible struggle, and could not but terminate in the death of
the dog! But suddenly, in the middle of a foaming circle, Top
reappeared. Thrown in the air by some unknown power, he rose ten
feet above the surface of the lake, fell again into the midst of
the agitated waters, and then soon gained the shore, without any
severe wounds, miraculously saved.

Cyrus Harding and his companions could not understand it. What
was not less inexplicable was that the struggle still appeared to
be going on. Doubtless, the dugong, attacked by some powerful
animal, after having released the dog, was fighting on its own
account. But it did not last long. The water became red with blood,
and the body of the dugong, emerging from the sheet of scarlet
which spread around, soon stranded on a little beach at the south
angle of the lake. The colonists ran towards it. The dugong was
dead. It was an enormous animal, fifteen or sixteen feet long, and
must have weighed from three to four thousand pounds. At its neck
was a wound, which appeared to have been produced by a sharp
blade.
