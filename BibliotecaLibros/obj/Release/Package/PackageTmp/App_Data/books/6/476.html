Shipbuilding was interrupted for a week for the harvest, the<br/>haymaking, and the gathering in of the different crops on the<br/>plateau. This work finished, every moment was devoted to finishing<br/>the schooner. When night came the workmen were really quite<br/>exhausted. So as not to lose any time they had changed the hours<br/>for their meals; they dined at twelve o'clock, and only had their<br/>supper when daylight failed them. They then ascended to Granite<br/>House, when they were always ready to go to bed.<br/><br/>Sometimes, however, when the conversation bore on some<br/>interesting subject the hour for sleep was delayed for a time. The<br/>colonists then spoke of the future, and talked willingly of the<br/>changes which a voyage in the schooner to inhabited lands would<br/>make in their situation. But always, in the midst of these plans,<br/>prevailed the thought of a subsequent return to Lincoln Island.<br/>Never would they abandon this colony, founded with so much labor<br/>and with such success, and to which a communication with America<br/>would afford a fresh impetus. Pencroft and Neb especially hoped to<br/>end their days there.<br/><br/>"Herbert," said the sailor, "you will never abandon Lincoln<br/>Island?"<br/><br/>"Never, Pencroft, and especially if you make up your mind to<br/>stay there."<br/><br/>"That was made up long ago, my boy," answered Pencroft. "I shall<br/>expect you. You will bring me your wife and children, and I shall<br/>make jolly chaps of your youngsters!"<br/><br/>"That's agreed," replied Herbert, laughing and blushing at the<br/>same time.<br/><br/>"And you, Captain Harding," resumed Pencroft enthusiastically,<br/>"you will be still the governor of the island! Ah, how many<br/>inhabitants could it support? Ten thousand at least!"<br/><br/>They talked in this way, allowing Pencroft to run on, and at<br/>last the reporter actually started a newspaperâ€”the New Lincoln<br/>Herald!<br/><br/>So is man's heart. The desire to perform a work which will<br/>endure, which will survive him, is the origin of his superiority<br/>over all other living creatures here below. It is this which has<br/>established his dominion, and this it is which justifies it, over<br/>all the world.<br/><br/>After that, who knows if Jup and Top had not themselves their<br/>little dream of the future.<br/><br/>Ayrton silently said to himself that he would like to see Lord<br/>Glenarvan again and show himself to all restored.<br/>
