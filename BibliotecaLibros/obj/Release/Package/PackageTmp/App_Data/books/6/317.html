<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>17<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>These last words justified the colonists' presentiment. There<br/>had been some mournful past, perhaps expiated in the sight of men,<br/>but from which his conscience had not yet absolved him. At any rate<br/>the guilty man felt remorse, he repented, and his new friends would<br/>have cordially pressed the hand which they sought; but he did not<br/>feel himself worthy to extend it to honest men! However, after the<br/>scene with the jaguar, he did not return to the forest, and from<br/>that day did not go beyond the enclosure of Granite House.<br/><br/>What was the mystery of his life? Would the stranger one day<br/>speak of it? Time alone could show. At any rate, it was agreed that<br/>his secret should never be asked from him, and that they would live<br/>with him as if they suspected nothing.<br/><br/>For some days their life continued as before. Cyrus Harding and<br/>Gideon Spilett worked together, sometimes chemists, sometimes<br/>experimentalists. The reporter never left the engineer except to<br/>hunt with Herbert, for it would not have been prudent to allow the<br/>lad to ramble alone in the forest; and it was very necessary to be<br/>on their guard. As to Neb and Pencroft, one day at the stables and<br/>poultry-yard, another at the corral, without reckoning work in<br/>Granite House, they were never in want of employment.<br/><br/>The stranger worked alone, and he had resumed his usual life,<br/>never appearing at meals, sleeping under the trees in the plateau,<br/>never mingling with his companions. It really seemed as if the<br/>society of those who had saved him was insupportable to him!<br/><br/>"But then," observed Pencroft, "why did he entreat the help of<br/>his fellow-creatures? Why did he throw that paper into the<br/>sea?"<br/><br/>"He will tell us why," invariably replied Cyrus Harding.<br/><br/>
