"The avenging power of the island," replied Harding, "he who
brought you here, Ayrton, whose influence has once more manifested
itself, who does for us all that which we cannot do for ourselves,
and who, his will accomplished, conceals himself from us."

"Let us make search for him, then!" exclaimed Pencroft.

"Yes, we will search for him," answered Harding, "but we shall
not discover this powerful being who performs such wonders, until
he pleases to call us to him!"

This invisible protection, which rendered their own action
unavailing, both irritated and piqued the engineer. The relative
inferiority which it proved was of a nature to wound a haughty
spirit. A generosity evinced in such a manner as to elude all
tokens of gratitude, implied a sort of disdain for those on whom
the obligation was conferred, which in Cyrus Harding's eyes marred,
in some degree, the worth of the benefit.

"Let us search," he resumed, "and God grant that we may some day
be permitted to prove to this haughty protector that he has not to
deal with ungrateful people! What would I not give could we repay
him, by rendering him in our turn, although at the price of our
lives, some signal service!"

From this day, the thoughts of the inhabitants of Lincoln Island
were solely occupied with the intended search. Everything incited
them to discover the answer to this enigma, an answer which would
only be the name of a man endowed with a truly inexplicable, and in
some degree superhuman power.

In a few minutes, the settlers re-entered the house, where their
influence soon restored to Ayrton his moral and physical energy.
Neb and Pencroft carried the corpses of the convicts into the
forest, some distance from the corral, and buried them deep in the
ground.

Ayrton was then made acquainted with the facts which had
occurred during his seclusion. He learned Herbert's adventures, and
through what various trials the colonists had passed. As to the
settlers, they had despaired of ever seeing Ayrton again, and had
been convinced that the convicts had ruthlessly murdered him.

"And now," said Cyrus Harding, as he ended his recital, "a duty
remains for us to perform. Half of our task is accomplished, but
although the convicts are no longer to be feared, it is not owing
to ourselves that we are once more masters of the island."

"Well!" answered Gideon Spilett, "let us search all this
labyrinth of the spurs of Mount Franklin. We will not leave a
hollow, not a hole unexplored! Ah! if ever a reporter found himself
face to face with a mystery, it is I who now speak to you, my
friends!"

"And we will not return to Granite House until we have found our
benefactor," said Herbert.
