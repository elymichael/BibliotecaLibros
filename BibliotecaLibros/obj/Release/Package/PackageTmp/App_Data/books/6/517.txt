horizontally, fastened the lamp to the end of an oar, and again
surveyed the basaltic wall at a greater elevation.

There, through scarcely visible clefts and joinings, escaped a
pungent vapor, which infected the atmosphere of the cavern. The
wall was broken by large cracks, some of which extended to within
two or three feet of the water's edge.

Cyrus Harding thought for a brief space. Then he said in a low

"Yes! the captain was right! The danger lies there, and a
terrible danger!"

Ayrton said not a word, but, upon a sign from Cyrus Harding,
resumed the oars, and half an hour later the engineer and he
reached the entrance of Dakkar Grotto.
