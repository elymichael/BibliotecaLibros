They now began the descent of the mountain. Climbing down the
crater, they went round the cone and reached their encampment of
the previous night. Pencroft thought it must be breakfast-time, and
the watches of the reporter and engineer were therefore consulted
to find out the hour.

That of Gideon Spilett had been preserved from the sea-water, as
he had been thrown at once on the sand out of reach of the waves.
It was an instrument of excellent quality, a perfect pocket
chronometer, which the reporter had not forgotten to wind up
carefully every day.

As to the engineer's watch, it, of course, had stopped during
the time which he had passed on the downs.

The engineer now wound it up, and ascertaining by the height of
the sun that it must be about nine o'clock in the morning, he put
his watch at that hour.

"No, my dear Spilett, wait. You have kept the Richmond time,
have you not?"

"Yes, Cyrus."
