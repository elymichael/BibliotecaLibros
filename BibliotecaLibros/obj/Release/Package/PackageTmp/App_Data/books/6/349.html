<br/>"No, Pencroft, but mysterious, most certainly," replied the<br/>engineer; "unless you can explain that which Spilett and I have<br/>until now failed to understand."<br/><br/>"Speak away, captain," answered the sailor.<br/><br/>"Well, have you understood," then said the engineer, "how was it<br/>that after falling into the sea, I was found a quarter of a mile<br/>into the interior of the island, and that, without my having any<br/>consciousness of my removal there?"<br/><br/>"Unless, being unconscious—" said Pencroft.<br/><br/>"That is not admissible," replied the engineer.

I confess, not at all," replied Pencroft, "and the wound<br/>which the dugong had in its side, a wound which seemed to have been<br/>made with a sharp instrument; that can't be understood,<br/>either."<br/><br/>"Let us continue again," said Harding.
