After boiling for several hours on a hot fire, which did as much<br/>good to the operators as the substance operated upon, the latter<br/>was transformed into a thick syrup. This syrup was poured into clay<br/>molds, previously fabricated in the kitchen stove, and to which<br/>they had given various shapes. The next day this syrup had become<br/>cold, and formed cakes and tablets. This was sugar of rather a<br/>reddish color, but nearly transparent and of a delicious taste.<br/><br/>The cold continued to the middle of September, and the prisoners<br/>in Granite House began to find their captivity rather tedious.<br/>Nearly every day they attempted sorties which they could not<br/>prolong. They constantly worked at the improvement of their<br/>dwelling. They talked while working. Harding instructed his<br/>companions in many things, principally explaining to them the<br/>practical applications of science. The colonists had no library at<br/>their disposal; but the engineer was a book which was always at<br/>hand, always open at the page which one wanted, a book which<br/>answered all their questions, and which they often consulted. The<br/>time thus passed away pleasantly, these brave men not appearing to<br/>have any fears for the future.<br/><br/>However, all were anxious to see, if not the fine season, at<br/>least the cessation of the insupportable cold. If only they had<br/>been clothed in a way to meet it, how many excursions they would<br/>have attempted, either to the downs or to Tadorn's Fens! Game would<br/>have been easily approached, and the chase would certainly have<br/>been most productive. But Cyrus Harding considered it of importance<br/>that no one should injure his health, for he had need of all his<br/>hands, and his advice was followed.<br/><br/>But it must be said, that the one who was most impatient of this<br/>imprisonment, after Pencroft perhaps, was Top. The faithful dog<br/>found Granite House very narrow. He ran backwards and forwards from<br/>one room to another, showing in his way how weary he was of being<br/>shut up. Harding often remarked that when he approached the dark<br/>well which communicated with the sea, and of which the orifice<br/>opened at the back of the storeroom, Top uttered singular<br/>growlings. He ran round and round this hole, which had been covered<br/>with a wooden lid. Sometimes even he tried to put his paws under<br/>the lid, as if he wished to raise it. He then yelped in a peculiar<br/>way, which showed at once anger and uneasiness.<br/><br/>The engineer observed this maneuver several times.<br/><br/>What could there be in this abyss to make such an impression on<br/>the intelligent animal? The well led to the sea, that was certain.<br/>Could narrow passages spread from it through the foundations of the<br/>island? Did some marine monster come from time to time, to breathe<br/>at the bottom of this well? The engineer did not know what to<br/>think, and could not refrain from dreaming of many strange<br/>improbabilities. Accustomed to go far into the regions of<br/>scientific reality, he would not allow himself to be drawn into the<br/>regions of the strange and almost of the supernatural; but yet how<br/>to explain why Top, one of those sensible dogs who never waste<br/>their time in barking at the moon, should persist in trying with<br/>scent and hearing to fathom this abyss, if there was nothing there<br/>to cause his uneasiness? Top's conduct puzzled Cyrus Harding even<br/>more than he cared to acknowledge to himself.<br/><br/>At all events, the engineer only communicated his impressions to<br/>Gideon Spilett, for he thought it useless to explain to his<br/>companions the suspicions which arose from what perhaps was only<br/>Top's fancy.<br/><br/>At last the cold ceased. There had been rain, squalls mingled<br/>with snow, hailstorms, gusts of wind, but these inclemencies did<br/>not last. The ice melted, the snow disappeared; the shore, the<br/>plateau, the banks of the Mercy, the forest, again became<br/>practicable. This return of spring delighted the tenants of Granite<br/>House, and they soon only passed it in the hours necessary for<br/>eating and sleeping.<br/><br/>They hunted much in the second part of September, which led<br/>Pencroft to again entreat for the firearms, which he asserted had<br/>been promised by Cyrus Harding. The latter, knowing well that<br/>without special tools it would be nearly impossible for him to<br/>manufacture a gun which would be of any use, still drew back and<br/>put off the operation to some future time, observing in his usual<br/>dry way, that Herbert and Spilett had become very skilful archers,<br/>so that many sorts of excellent animals, agouties, kangaroos,<br/>capybaras, pigeons, bustards, wild ducks, snipes, in short, game<br/>both with fur and feathers, fell victims to their arrows, and that,<br/>consequently, they could wait. But the obstinate sailor would<br/>listen to nothing of this, and he would give the engineer no peace<br/>till he promised to satisfy his desire. Gideon Spilett, however,<br/>supported Pencroft.<br/><br/>"If, which may be doubted," said he, "the island is inhabited by<br/>wild beasts, we must think how to fight with and exterminate them.<br/>A time may come when this will be our first duty."<br/><br/>But at this period, it was not the question of firearms which<br/>occupied Harding, but that of clothes. Those which the settlers<br/>wore had passed this winter, but they would not last until next<br/>winter. Skins of carnivora or the wool of ruminants must be<br/>procured at any price, and since there were plenty of musmons, it<br/>was agreed to consult on the means of forming a flock which might<br/>be brought up for the use of the colony. An enclosure for the<br/>domestic animals, a poultry-yard for the birds, in a word to<br/>establish a sort of farm in the island, such were the two important<br/>projects for the fine season.<br/>
