<br/>The poultry-yard occupied an area of two hundred square yards,<br/>on the southeastern bank of the lake. It was surrounded by a<br/>palisade, and in it were constructed various shelters for the birds<br/>which were to populate it. These were simply built of branches and<br/>divided into compartments, made ready for the expected guests.<br/><br/>The first were the two tinamous, which were not long in having a<br/>number of young ones; they had for companions half a dozen ducks,<br/>accustomed to the borders of the lake. Some belonged to the Chinese<br/>species, of which the wings open like a fan, and which by the<br/>brilliancy of their plumage rival the golden pheasants. A few days<br/>afterwards, Herbert snared a couple of gallinaceae, with spreading<br/>tails composed of long feathers, magnificent alectors, which soon<br/>became tame. As to pelicans, kingfishers, water-hens, they came of<br/>themselves to the shores of the poultry-yard, and this little<br/>community, after some disputes, cooing, screaming, clucking, ended<br/>by settling down peacefully, and increased in encouraging<br/>proportion for the future use of the colony.<br/><br/>Cyrus Harding, wishing to complete his performance, established<br/>a pigeon- house in a corner of the poultry-yard. There he lodged a<br/>dozen of those pigeons which frequented the rocks of the plateau.<br/>These birds soon became accustomed to returning every evening to<br/>their new dwelling, and showed more disposition to domesticate<br/>themselves than their congeners, the wood- pigeons.<br/><br/>Lastly, the time had come for turning the balloon-case to use,<br/>by cutting it up to make shirts and other articles; for as to<br/>keeping it in its present form, and risking themselves in a balloon<br/>filled with gas, above a sea of the limits of which they had no<br/>idea, it was not to be thought of.<br/><br/>It was necessary to bring the case to Granite House, and the<br/>colonists employed themselves in rendering their heavy cart lighter<br/>and more manageable. But though they had a vehicle, the moving<br/>power was yet to be found.<br/><br/>But did there not exist in the island some animal which might<br/>supply the place of the horse, ass, or ox? That was the<br/>question.<br/><br/>"Certainly," said Pencroft, "a beast of burden would be very<br/>useful to us until the captain has made a steam cart, or even an<br/>engine, for some day we shall have a railroad from Granite House to<br/>Port Balloon, with a branch line to Mount Franklin!"<br/><br/>One day, the 23rd of December, Neb and Top were heard shouting<br/>and barking, each apparently trying to see who could make the most<br/>noise. The settlers, who were busy at the Chimneys, ran, fearing<br/>some vexatious incident.<br/><br/>What did they see? Two fine animals of a large size that had<br/>imprudently ventured on the plateau, when the bridges were open.<br/>One would have said they were horses, or at least donkeys, male and<br/>female, of a fine shape, dove-colored, the legs and tail white,<br/>striped with black on the head and neck. They advanced quietly<br/>without showing any uneasiness, and gazed at the men, in whom they<br/>could not as yet recognize their future masters.<br/><br/>"These are onagers!" cried Herbert, "animals something between<br/>the zebra and the quagga!"<br/><br/>
