<br/>"If, on my return, I find a fire at the house, I shall believe<br/>that the thunder itself came to light it." All three climbed the<br/>bank; and arrived at the angle made by the river, the sailor,<br/>stopping, said to his two companions,â€”<br/><br/>"Shall we begin by being hunters or wood-men?"<br/><br/>"Hunters," replied Herbert. "There is Top already in quest."<br/><br/>"We will hunt, then," said the sailor, "and afterwards we can<br/>come back and collect our wood."<br/><br/>This agreed to, Herbert, Neb, and Pencroft, after having torn<br/>three sticks from the trunk of a young fir, followed Top, who was<br/>bounding about among the long grass.<br/><br/>This time, the hunters, instead of following the course of the<br/>river, plunged straight into the heart of the forest. There were<br/>still the same trees, belonging, for the most part, to the pine<br/>family. In certain places, less crowded, growing in clumps, these<br/>pines exhibited considerable dimensions, and appeared to indicate,<br/>by their development, that the country was situated in a higher<br/>latitude than the engineer had supposed. Glades, bristling with<br/>stumps worn away by time, were covered with dry wood, which formed<br/>an inexhaustible store of fuel. Then, the glade passed, the<br/>underwood thickened again, and became almost impenetrable.<br/><br/>It was difficult enough to find the way among the groups of<br/>trees, without any beaten track. So the sailor from time to time<br/>broke off branches which might be easily recognized. But, perhaps,<br/>he was wrong not to follow the watercourse, as he and Herbert had<br/>done on their first excursion, for after walking an hour not a<br/>creature had shown itself. Top, running under the branches, only<br/>roused birds which could not be approached. Even the couroucous<br/>were invisible, and it was probable that the sailor would be<br/>obliged to return to the marshy part of the forest, in which he had<br/>so happily performed his grouse fishing.<br/><br/>"Well, Pencroft," said Neb, in a slightly sarcastic tone, "if<br/>this is all the game which you promised to bring back to my master,<br/>it won't need a large fire to roast it!"<br/><br/>"Have patience," replied the sailor, "it isn't the game which<br/>will be wanting on our return."<br/><br/>"Have you not confidence in Captain Harding?"<br/><br/>
