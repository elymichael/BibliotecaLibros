"Well!" answered Pencroft, "I agree with you that the nobleman
will return, and soon too. But where will he touch? At Tabor
Island, and not at Lincoln Island."

"That is the more certain," replied Herbert, "as Lincoln Island
is not even marked on the map."

"Therefore, my friends," said the engineer, "we ought to take
the necessary precautions for making our presence and that of
Ayrton on Lincoln Island known at Tabor Island."

"Certainly," answered the reporter, "and nothing is easier than
to place in the hut, which was Captain Grant's and Ayrton's
dwelling, a notice which Lord Glenarvan and his crew cannot help
finding, giving the position of our island."

"It is a pity," remarked the sailor, "that we forgot to take
that precaution on our first visit to Tabor Island."

"And why should we have done it?" asked Herbert. "At that time
we did not know Ayrton's history; we did not know that any one was
likely to come some day to fetch him, and when we did know his
history, the season was too advanced to allow us to return then to
Tabor Island."

"Yes," replied Harding, "it was too late, and we must put off
the voyage until next spring."

"But suppose the Scotch yacht comes before that," said
Pencroft.

"That is not probable," replied the engineer, "for Lord
Glenarvan would not choose the winter season to venture into these
seas. Either he has already returned to Tabor Island, since Ayrton
has been with us, that is to say, during the last five months and
has left again; or he will not come till later, and it will be time
enough in the first fine October days to go to Tabor Island, and
leave a notice there."

"We must allow," said Neb, "that it will be very unfortunate if
the 'Duncan' has returned to these parts only a few months
ago!"
