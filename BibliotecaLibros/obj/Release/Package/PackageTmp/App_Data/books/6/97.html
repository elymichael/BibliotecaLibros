Cyrus Harding proposed that they should return to the western<br/>shore of the lake, where the day before he had noticed the clayey<br/>ground of which he possessed a specimen. They therefore followed<br/>the bank of the Mercy, traversed Prospect Heights, and alter a walk<br/>of five miles or more they reached a glade, situated two hundred<br/>feet from Lake Grant.<br/><br/>On the way Herbert had discovered a tree, the branches of which<br/>the Indians of South America employ for making their bows. It was<br/>the crejimba, of the palm family, which does not bear edible fruit.<br/>Long straight branches were cut, the leaves stripped off; it was<br/>shaped, stronger in the middle, more slender at the extremities,<br/>and nothing remained to be done but to find a plant fit to make the<br/>bow-string. This was the "hibiscus heterophyllus," which furnishes<br/>fibers of such remarkable tenacity that they have been compared to<br/>the tendons of animals. Pencroft thus obtained bows of tolerable<br/>strength, for which he only wanted arrows. These were easily made<br/>with straight stiff branches, without knots, but the points with<br/>which they must be armed, that is to say, a substance to serve in<br/>lieu of iron, could not be met with so easily. But Pencroft said,<br/>that having done his part of the work, chance would do the<br/>rest.<br/><br/>The settlers arrived on the ground which had been discovered the<br/>day before. Being composed of the sort of clay which is used for<br/>making bricks and tiles, it was very useful for the work in<br/>question. There was no great difficulty in it. It was enough to<br/>scour the clay with sand, then to mold the bricks and bake them by<br/>the heat of a wood fire.<br/><br/>Generally bricks are formed in molds, but the engineer contented<br/>himself with making them by hand. All that day and the day<br/>following were employed in this work. The clay, soaked in water,<br/>was mixed by the feet and hands of the manipulators, and then<br/>divided into pieces of equal size. A practiced workman can make,<br/>without a machine, about ten thousand bricks in twelve hours; but<br/>in their two days work the five brickmakers on Lincoln Island had<br/>not made more than three thousand, which were ranged near each<br/>other, until the time when their complete desiccation would permit<br/>them to be used in building the oven, that is to say, in three or<br/>four days.<br/><br/>It was on the 2nd of April that Harding had employed himself in<br/>fixing the orientation of the island, or, in other words, the<br/>precise spot where the sun rose. The day before he had noted<br/>exactly the hour when the sun disappeared beneath the horizon,<br/>making allowance for the refraction. This morning he noted, no less<br/>exactly, the hour at which it reappeared. Between this setting and<br/>rising twelve hours, twenty-four minutes passed. Then, six hours,<br/>twelve minutes after its rising, the sun on this day would exactly<br/>pass the meridian and the point of the sky which it occupied at<br/>this moment would be the north. At the said hour, Cyrus marked this<br/>point, and putting in a line with the sun two trees which would<br/>serve him for marks, he thus obtained an invariable meridian for<br/>his ulterior operations.<br/><br/>The settlers employed the two days before the oven was built in<br/>collecting fuel. Branches were cut all round the glade, and they<br/>picked up all the fallen wood under the trees. They were also able<br/>to hunt with greater success, since Pencroft now possessed some<br/>dozen arrows armed with sharp points. It was Top who had famished<br/>these points, by bringing in a porcupine, rather inferior eating,<br/>but of great value, thanks to the quills with which it bristled.<br/>These quills were fixed firmly at the ends of the arrows, the<br/>flight of which was made more certain by some cockatoos' feathers.<br/>The reporter and Herbert soon became very skilful archers. Game of<br/>all sorts in consequence abounded at the Chimneys, capybaras,<br/>pigeons, agouties, grouse, etc. The greater part of these animals<br/>were killed in the part of the forest on the left bank of the<br/>Mercy, to which they gave the name of Jacamar Wood, in remembrance<br/>of the bird which Pencroft and Herbert had pursued when on their<br/>first exploration.<br/><br/>This game was eaten fresh, but they preserved some capybara<br/>hams, by smoking them above a fire of green wood, after having<br/>perfumed them with sweet-smelling leaves. However, this food,<br/>although very strengthening, was always roast upon roast, and the<br/>party would have been delighted to hear some soup bubbling on the<br/>hearth, but they must wait till a pot could be made, and,<br/>consequently, till the oven was built.<br/><br/>During these excursions, which were not extended far from the<br/>brick- field, the hunters could discern the recent passage of<br/>animals of a large size, armed with powerful claws, but they could<br/>not recognize the species. Cyrus Harding advised them to be very<br/>careful, as the forest probably enclosed many dangerous beasts.<br/><br/>And he did right. Indeed, Gideon Spilett and Herbert one day saw<br/>an animal which resembled a jaguar. Happily the creature did not<br/>attack them, or they might not have escaped without a severe wound.<br/>As soon as he could get a regular weapon, that is to say, one of<br/>the guns which Pencroft begged for, Gideon Spilett resolved to make<br/>desperate war against the ferocious beasts, and exterminate them<br/>from the island.<br/><br/>The Chimneys during these few days was not made more<br/>comfortable, for the engineer hoped to discover, or build if<br/>necessary, a more convenient dwelling. They contented themselves<br/>with spreading moss and dry leaves on the sand of the passages, and<br/>on these primitive couches the tired workers slept soundly.<br/><br/>They also reckoned the days they had passed on Lincoln Island,<br/>and from that time kept a regular account. The 5th of April, which<br/>was Wednesday, was twelve days from the time when the wind threw<br/>the castaways on this shore.<br/>
