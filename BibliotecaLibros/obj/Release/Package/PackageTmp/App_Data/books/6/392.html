Most of them contained clothes, which, as may be believed, was<br/>well received. There were enough to clothe a whole colony—linen for<br/>every one's use, shoes for every one's feet.<br/><br/>"We are too rich!" exclaimed Pencroft, "But what are we going to<br/>do with all this?"<br/><br/>And every moment burst forth the hurrahs of the delighted sailor<br/>when he caught sight of the barrels of gunpowder, firearms and<br/>sidearms, balls of cotton, implements of husbandry, carpenter's,<br/>joiner's, and blacksmith's tools, and boxes of all kinds of seeds,<br/>not in the least injured by their short sojourn in the water. Ah,<br/>two years before, how these things would have been prized! And now,<br/>even though the industrious colonists had provided themselves with<br/>tools, these treasures would find their use.<br/><br/>There was no want of space in the store-rooms of Granite House,<br/>but that daytime would not allow them to stow away the whole. It<br/>would not do also to forget that the six survivors of the<br/>"Speedy's" crew had landed on the island, for they were in all<br/>probability scoundrels of the deepest dye, and it was necessary<br/>that the colonists should be on their guard against them. Although<br/>the bridges over the Mercy were raised, the convicts would not be<br/>stopped by a river or a stream and, rendered desperate, these<br/>wretches would be capable of anything.<br/><br/>They would see later what plan it would be best to follow; but<br/>in the meantime it was necessary to mount guard over cases and<br/>packages heaped up near the Chimneys, and thus the settlers<br/>employed themselves in turn during the night.<br/><br/>The morning came, however, without the convicts having attempted<br/>any attack. Master Jup and Top, on guard at the foot of Granite<br/>House, would have quickly given the alarm. The three following<br/>day—the 19th, 20th, and 21st of October—were employed in saving<br/>everything of value, or of any use whatever, either from the cargo<br/>or rigging of the brig. At low tide they overhauled the hold—at<br/>high tide they stowed away the rescued articles. A great part of<br/>the copper sheathing had been torn from the hull, which every day<br/>sank lower. But before the sand had swallowed the heavy things<br/>which had fallen through the bottom, Ayrton and Pencroft, diving to<br/>the bed of the channel, recovered the chains and anchors of the<br/>brig, the iron of her ballast, and even four guns, which, floated<br/>by means of empty casks, were brought to shore.<br/><br/>It may be seen that the arsenal of the colony had gained by the<br/>wreck, as well as the storerooms of Granite House. Pencroft, always<br/>enthusiastic in his projects, already spoke of constructing a<br/>battery to command the channel and the mouth of the river. With<br/>four guns, he engaged to prevent any fleet, "however powerful it<br/>might be," from venturing into the waters of Lincoln Island!<br/><br/>In the meantime, when nothing remained of the brig but a useless<br/>hulk, bad weather came on, which soon finished her. Cyrus Harding<br/>had intended to blow her up, so as to collect the remains on the<br/>shore, but a strong gale from the northeast and a heavy sea<br/>compelled him to economize his powder.<br/><br/>In fact, on the night of the 23rd, the hull entirely broke up,<br/>and some of the wreck was cast up on the beach.<br/><br/>As to the papers on board, it is useless to say that, although<br/>he carefully searched the lockers of the poop, Harding did not<br/>discover any trace of them. The pirates had evidently destroyed<br/>everything that concerned either the captain or the owners of the<br/>"Speedy," and, as the name of her port was not painted on her<br/>counter, there was nothing which would tell them her nationality.<br/>However, by the shape of her boats Ayrton and Pencroft believed<br/>that the brig was of English build.<br/><br/>A week after the castrophe—or, rather, after the fortunate,<br/>though inexplicable, event to which the colony owed its<br/>preservation—nothing more could be seen of the vessel, even at low<br/>tide. The wreck had disappeared, and Granite House was enriched by<br/>nearly all it had contained.<br/>
