<br/>Neb and Herbert ran to the edge of the lake, shaded with pines<br/>and other green trees, and soon returned with some branches, which<br/>they made into torches. The torches were lighted with flint and<br/>steel, and Cyrus Harding leading, the settlers ventured into the<br/>dark passage, which the overplus of the lake had formerly<br/>filled.<br/><br/>Contrary to what might have been supposed, the diameter of the<br/>passage increased as the explorers proceeded, so that they very<br/>soon were able to stand upright. The granite, worn by the water for<br/>an infinite time, was very slippery, and falls were to be dreaded.<br/>But the settlers were all attached to each other by a cord, as is<br/>frequently done in ascending mountains. Happily some projections of<br/>the granite, forming regular steps, made the descent less perilous.<br/>Drops, still hanging from the rocks, shone here and there under the<br/>light of the torches, and the explorers guessed that the sides were<br/>clothed with innumerable stalactites. The engineer examined this<br/>black granite. There was not a stratum, not a break in it. The mass<br/>was compact, and of an extremely close grain. The passage dated,<br/>then, from the very origin of the island. It was not the water<br/>which little by little had hollowed it. Pluto and not Neptune had<br/>bored it with his own hand, and on the wall traces of an eruptive<br/>work could be distinguished, which all the washing of the water had<br/>not been able totally to efface.<br/><br/>The settlers descended very slowly. They could not but feel a<br/>certain awe, in this venturing into these unknown depths, for the<br/>first time visited by human beings. They did not speak, but they<br/>thought; and the thought came to more than one, that some polypus<br/>or other gigantic cephalopod might inhabit the interior cavities,<br/>which were in communication with the sea. However, Top kept at the<br/>head of the little band, and they could rely on the sagacity of the<br/>dog, who would not fail to give the alarm if there was any need for<br/>it.<br/><br/>After having descended about a hundred feet, following a winding<br/>road, Harding who was walking on before, stopped, and his<br/>companions came up with him. The place where they had halted was<br/>wider, so as to form a cavern of moderate dimensions. Drops of<br/>water fell from the vault, but that did not prove that they oozed<br/>through the rock. They were simply the last traces left by the<br/>torrent which had so long thundered through this cavity, and the<br/>air there was pure though slightly damp, but producing no mephitic<br/>exhalation.<br/><br/>"Well, my dear Cyrus," said Gideon Spilett, "here is a very<br/>secure retreat, well hid in the depths of the rock, but it is,<br/>however, uninhabitable."<br/><br/>"Why uninhabitable?" asked the sailor.<br/><br/>"Because it is too small and too dark."<br/><br/>"Couldn't we enlarge it, hollow it out, make openings to let in<br/>light and air?" replied Pencroft, who now thought nothing<br/>impossible.<br/><br/>"Let us go on with our exploration," said Cyrus Harding.<br/>"Perhaps lower down, nature will have spared us this labor."<br/><br/>"We have only gone a third of the way," observed Herbert.<br/><br/>
