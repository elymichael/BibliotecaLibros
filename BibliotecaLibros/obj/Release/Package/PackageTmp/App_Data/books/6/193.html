<br/>"About seven miles," replied the engineer, "taking into<br/>calculation, however, the detours of the river, which has carried<br/>us to the northwest."<br/><br/>"Shall we go on?" asked the reporter.<br/><br/>"Yes, as long as we can," replied Cyrus Harding. "To-morrow, at<br/>break of day, we will leave the canoe, and in two hours I hope we<br/>shall cross the distance which separates us from the coast, and<br/>then we shall have the whole day in which to explore the<br/>shore."<br/><br/>"Go ahead!" replied Pencroft.<br/><br/>But soon the boat grated on the stony bottom of the river, which<br/>was now not more than twenty feet in breadth. The trees met like a<br/>bower overhead, and caused a half-darkness. They also heard the<br/>noise of a waterfall, which showed that a few hundred feet up the<br/>river there was a natural barrier.<br/><br/>Presently, after a sudden turn of the river, a cascade appeared<br/>through the trees. The canoe again touched the bottom, and in a few<br/>minutes it was moored to a trunk near the right bank.<br/><br/>It was nearly five o'clock. The last rays of the sun gleamed<br/>through the thick foliage and glanced on the little waterfall,<br/>making the spray sparkle with all the colors of the rainbow. Beyond<br/>that, the Mercy was lost in the bushwood, where it was fed from<br/>some hidden source. The different streams which flowed into it<br/>increased it to a regular river further down, but here it was<br/>simply a shallow, limpid brook.<br/><br/>It was agreed to camp here, as the place was charming. The<br/>colonists disembarked, and a fire was soon lighted under a clump of<br/>trees, among the branches of which Cyrus Harding and his companions<br/>could, if it was necessary, take refuge for the night.<br/><br/>Supper was quickly devoured, for they were very hungry, and then<br/>there was only sleeping to think of. But, as roarings of rather a<br/>suspicious nature had been heard during the evening, a good fire<br/>was made up for the night, so as to protect the sleepers with its<br/>crackling flames. Neb and Pencroft also watched by turns, and did<br/>not spare fuel. They thought they saw the dark forms of some wild<br/>animals prowling round the camp among the bushes, but the night<br/>passed without incident, and the next day, the 31st of October, at<br/>five o'clock in the morning, all were on foot, ready for a<br/>start.<br/><br/><br/><br/>
