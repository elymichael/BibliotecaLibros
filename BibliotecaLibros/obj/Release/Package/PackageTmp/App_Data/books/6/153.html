Their shortest way was to cross the Mercy on the ice, which then<br/>covered it.<br/><br/>"But," as the engineer justly observed, "that could not take the<br/>place of a regular bridge!" So, the construction of a regular<br/>bridge was noted in the list of future works.<br/><br/>It was the first time that the settlers had set foot on the<br/>right bank of the Mercy, and ventured into the midst of those<br/>gigantic and superb coniferae now sprinkled over with snow.<br/><br/>But they had not gone half a mile when from a thicket a whole<br/>family of quadrupeds, who had made a home there, disturbed by Top,<br/>rushed forth into the open country.<br/><br/>"Ah! I should say those are foxes!" cried Herbert, when he saw<br/>the troop rapidly decamping.<br/><br/>They were foxes, but of a very large size, who uttered a sort of<br/>barking, at which Top seemed to be very much astonished, for he<br/>stopped short in the chase, and gave the swift animals time to<br/>disappear.<br/><br/>The dog had reason to be surprised, as he did not know Natural<br/>History. But, by their barking, these foxes, with reddish-gray<br/>hair, black tails terminating in a white tuft, had betrayed their<br/>origin. So Herbert was able, without hesitating, to give them their<br/>real name of "Arctic foxes." They are frequently met with in Chile,<br/>in the Falkland Islands, and in all parts of America traversed by<br/>the thirtieth and fortieth parallels. Herbert much regretted that<br/>Top had not been able to catch one of these carnivora.<br/><br/>"Are they good to eat?" asked Pencroft, who only regarded the<br/>representatives of the fauna in the island from one special point<br/>of view.<br/><br/>"No," replied Herbert; "but zoologists have not yet found out if<br/>the eye of these foxes is diurnal or nocturnal, or whether it is<br/>correct to class them in the genus dog, properly so called."<br/><br/>Harding could not help smiling on hearing the lad's reflection,<br/>which showed a thoughtful mind. As to the sailor, from the moment<br/>when he found that the foxes were not classed in the genus eatable,<br/>they were nothing to him. However, when a poultry-yard was<br/>established at Granite House, he observed that it would be best to<br/>take some precautions against a probable visit from these<br/>four-legged plunderers, and no one disputed this.<br/><br/>After having turned the point, the settlers saw a long beach<br/>washed by the open sea. It was then eight o'clock in the morning.<br/>The sky was very clear, as it often is after prolonged cold; but<br/>warmed by their walk, neither Harding nor his companions felt the<br/>sharpness of the atmosphere too severely. Besides there was no<br/>wind, which made it much more bearable. A brilliant sun, but<br/>without any calorific action, was just issuing from the ocean. The<br/>sea was as tranquil and blue as that of a Mediterranean gulf, when<br/>the sky is clear. Claw Cape, bent in the form of a yataghan,<br/>tapered away nearly four miles to the southeast. To the left the<br/>edge of the marsh was abruptly ended by a little point. Certainly,<br/>in this part of Union Bay, which nothing sheltered from the open<br/>sea, not even a sandbank, ships beaten by the east winds would have<br/>found no shelter. They perceived by the tranquillity of the sea, in<br/>which no shallows troubled the waters, by its uniform color, which<br/>was stained by no yellow shades, by the absence of even a reef,<br/>that the coast was steep and that the ocean there covered a deep<br/>abyss. Behind in the west, but at a distance of four miles, rose<br/>the first trees of the forests of the Far West. They might have<br/>believed themselves to be on the desolate coast of some island in<br/>the Antarctic regions which the ice had invaded. The colonists<br/>halted at this place for breakfast. A fire of brushwood and dried<br/>seaweed was lighted, and Neb prepared the breakfast of cold meat,<br/>to which he added some cups of Oswego tea.<br/>
