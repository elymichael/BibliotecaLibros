"You are not hurt, Herbert?" asked Spilett.<br/><br/>"No, no!"<br/><br/>"Oh, if this ape had wounded him!" exclaimed Pencroft.<br/><br/>"But he is not an ape," answered Herbert.<br/><br/>At these words Pencroft and Gideon Spilett looked at the<br/>singular being who lay on the ground. Indeed it was not an ape; it<br/>was a human being, a man. But what a man! A savage in all the<br/>horrible acceptation of the word, and so much the more frightful<br/>that he seemed fallen to the lowest degree of brutishness!<br/><br/>Shaggy hair, untrimmed beard descending to the chest, the body<br/>almost naked except a rag round the waist, wild eyes, enormous<br/>hands with immensely long nails, skin the color of mahogany, feet<br/>as hard as if made of horn, such was the miserable creature who yet<br/>had a claim to be called a man. But it might justly be asked if<br/>there were yet a soul in this body, or if the brute instinct alone<br/>survived in it!<br/><br/>"Are you quite sure that this is a man, or that he has ever been<br/>one?" said Pencroft to the reporter.<br/><br/>"Alas! there is no doubt about it," replied Spilett.<br/><br/>"Then this must be the castaway?" asked Herbert.<br/><br/>"Yes," replied Gideon Spilett, "but the unfortunate man has no<br/>longer anything human about him!"<br/><br/>The reporter spoke the truth. It was evident that if the<br/>castaway had ever been a civilized being, solitude had made him a<br/>savage, or worse, perhaps a regular man of the woods. Hoarse sounds<br/>issued from his throat between his teeth, which were sharp as the<br/>teeth of a wild beast made to tear raw flesh.<br/>
