"Land!" shouted Pencroft at about six o'clock in the
morning.

And it was impossible that Pencroft should be mistaken, it was
evident that land was there. Imagine the joy of the little crew of
the "Bonadventure." In a few hours they would land on the beach of
the island!

The low coast of Tabor Island, scarcely emerging from the sea,
was not more than fifteen miles distant.

The head of the "Bonadventure," which was a little to the south
of the island, was set directly towards it, and as the sun mounted
in the east, its rays fell upon one or two headlands.

"This is a much less important isle than Lincoln Island,"
observed Herbert, "and is probably due like ours to some submarine
convulsion."

At eleven o'clock the "Bonadventure" was not more than two miles
off, and Pencroft, while looking for a suitable place at which to
land, proceeded very cautiously through the unknown waters. The
whole of the island could now be surveyed, and on it could be seen
groups of gum and other large trees, of the same species as those
growing on Lincoln Island. But the astonishing thing was that no
smoke arose to show that the island was inhabited, no signal
whatever appeared on the shore!

And yet the document was clear enough; there was a castaway, and
this castaway should have been on the watch.

In the meanwhile the "Bonadventure" entered the winding channels
among the reefs, and Pencroft observed every turn with extreme
care. He had put Herbert at the helm, posting himself in the bows,
inspecting the water, while he held the halliard in his hand, ready
to lower the sail at a moment's notice. Gideon Spilett with his
glass eagerly scanned the shore, though without perceiving
anything.

However, at about twelve o'clock the keel of the "Bonadventure"
grated on the bottom. The anchor was let go, the sails furled, and
the crew of the little vessel landed.

And there was no reason to doubt that this was Tabor Island,
since according to the most recent charts there was no island in
this part of the Pacific between New Zealand and the American
Coast.
