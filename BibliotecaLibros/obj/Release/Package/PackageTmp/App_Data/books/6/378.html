They advanced to within five cables-lengths of that part of the<br/>shore terminated by Flotsam Point, and after having rounded it in a<br/>semicircular line, still protected by the brig's guns, they<br/>proceeded towards the mouth of the Mercy.<br/><br/>Their evident intention was to penetrate into the channel, and<br/>cut off the colonists posted on the islet, in such a way, that<br/>whatever their number might be, being placed between the fire from<br/>the boat and the fire from the brig, they would find themselves in<br/>a very disadvantageous position.<br/><br/>A quarter of an hour passed while the boat advanced in this<br/>direction. Absolute silence, perfect calm reigned in the air and on<br/>the water.<br/><br/>Pencroft and Ayrton, although they knew they ran the risk of<br/>being cut off, had not left their post, both that they did not wish<br/>to show themselves as yet to their assailants, and expose<br/>themselves to the "Speedy's" guns, and that they relied on Neb and<br/>Gideon Spilett, watching at the mouth of the river, and on Cyrus<br/>Harding and Herbert, in ambush among the rocks at the Chimneys.<br/><br/>Twenty minutes after the first shots were fired, the boat was<br/>less than two cables-lengths off the Mercy. As the tide was<br/>beginning to rise with its accustomed violence, caused by the<br/>narrowness of the straits, the pirates were drawn towards the<br/>river, and it was only by dint of hard rowing that they were able<br/>to keep in the middle of the channel. But, as they were passing<br/>within good range of the mouth of the Mercy, two balls saluted<br/>them, and two more of their number were laid in the bottom of the<br/>boat. Neb and Spilett had not missed their aim.<br/><br/>The brig immediately sent a second ball on the post betrayed by<br/>the smoke, but without any other result than that of splintering<br/>the rock.<br/><br/>The boat now contained only three able men. Carried on by the<br/>current, it shot through the channel with the rapidity of an arrow,<br/>passed before Harding and Herbert, who, not thinking it within<br/>range, withheld their fire, then, rounding the northern point of<br/>the islet with the two remaining oars, they pulled towards the<br/>brig.<br/><br/>Hitherto the settlers had nothing to complain of. Their<br/>adversaries had certainly had the worst of it. The latter already<br/>counted four men seriously wounded if not dead; they, on the<br/>contrary, unwounded, had not missed a shot. If the pirates<br/>continued to attack them in this way, if they renewed their attempt<br/>to land by means of a boat, they could be destroyed one by one.<br/><br/>It was now seen how advantageous the engineer's arrangements had<br/>been. The pirates would think that they had to deal with numerous<br/>and well-armed adversaries, whom they could not easily get the<br/>better of.<br/><br/>Half an hour passed before the boat, having to pull against the<br/>current, could get alongside the "Speedy." Frightful cries were<br/>heard when they returned on board with the wounded, and two or<br/>three guns were fired with no results.<br/><br/>But now about a dozen other convicts, maddened with rage, and<br/>possibly by the effect of the evening's potations, threw themselves<br/>into the boat. A second boat was also lowered, in which eight men<br/>took their places, and while the first pulled straight for the<br/>islet, to dislodge the colonists from thence the second maneuvered<br/>so as to force the entrance of the Mercy.<br/>
