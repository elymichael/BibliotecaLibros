"I am a good swimmer, Mr. Herbert."

"I tell you it is risking your life," said the engineer.

"That is no matter," answered Ayrton. "Captain Harding, I ask
this as a favor. Perhaps it will be a means of raising me in my own
eyes!"

"Go, Ayrton," replied the engineer, who felt sure that a refusal
would have deeply wounded the former convict, now become an honest
man.

"I will accompany you," said Pencroft.

"You mistrust me!" said Ayrton quickly.

Then more humbly,â€”

"Alas!"

"No! no!" exclaimed Harding with animation, "no, Ayrton,
Pencroft does not mistrust you. You interpret his words
wrongly."

"Indeed," returned the sailor, "I only propose to accompany
Ayrton as far as the islet. It may be, although it is scarcely
possible, that one of these villains has landed, and in that case
two men will not be too many to hinder him from giving the alarm. I
will wait for Ayrton on the islet, and he shall go alone to the
vessel, since he has proposed to do so." These things agreed to,
Ayrton made preparations for his departure. His plan was bold, but
it might succeed, thanks to the darkness of the night. Once arrived
at the vessel's side, Ayrton, holding on to the main chains, might
reconnoiter the number and perhaps overhear the intentions of the
pirates.
