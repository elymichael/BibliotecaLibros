<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>11<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>Gideon Spilett took the box and opened it. It contained nearly<br/>two hundred grains of a white powder, a few particles of which he<br/>carried to his lips. The extreme bitterness of the substance<br/>precluded all doubt; it was certainly the precious extract of<br/>quinine, that pre-eminent antifebrile.<br/><br/>This powder must be administered to Herbert without delay. How<br/>it came there might be discussed later.<br/><br/>"Some coffee!" said Spilett.<br/><br/>In a few moments Neb brought a cup of the warm infusion. Gideon<br/>Spilett threw into it about eighteen grains of quinine, and they<br/>succeeded in making Herbert drink the mixture.<br/><br/>There was still time, for the third attack of the malignant<br/>fever had not yet shown itself. How they longed to be able to add<br/>that it would not return!<br/><br/>Besides, it must be remarked, the hopes of all had now revived.<br/>The mysterious influence had been again exerted, and in a critical<br/>moment, when they had despaired of it.<br/><br/>
