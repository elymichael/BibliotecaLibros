Turning to his<br/>friends, he added, "Let us pray for him whom we have lost!"<br/><br/>Some hours later the colonists fulfilled the promise made to the<br/>captain by carrying out his dying wishes.<br/><br/>Cyrus Harding and his companions quitted the "Nautilus," taking<br/>with them the only memento left them by their benefactor, the<br/>coffer which contained wealth amounting to millions.<br/><br/>The marvelous saloon, still flooded with light, had been<br/>carefully closed. The iron door leading on deck was then securely<br/>fastened in such a manner as to prevent even a drop of water from<br/>penetrating to the interior of the "Nautilus."<br/><br/>The colonists then descended into the canoe, which was moored to<br/>the side of the submarine vessel.<br/><br/>The canoe was now brought around to the stern. There, at the<br/>water-line, were two large stop-cocks communicating with the<br/>reservoirs employed in the submersion of the vessel.<br/><br/>The stop-cocks were opened, the reservoirs filled, and the<br/>"Nautilus," slowly sinking, disappeared beneath the surface of the<br/>lake.<br/><br/>But the colonists were yet able to follow its descent through<br/>the waves. The powerful light it gave forth lighted up the<br/>translucent water, while the cavern became gradually obscure.
