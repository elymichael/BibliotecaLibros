<br/>"Provided it grows!" cried the sailor.<br/><br/>"It will grow," replied Cyrus Harding.<br/><br/>This was the 20th of June. The time was then propitious for<br/>sowing this single precious grain of corn. It was first proposed to<br/>plant it in a pot, but upon reflection it was decided to leave it<br/>to nature, and confide it to the earth. This was done that very<br/>day, and it is needless to add, that every precaution was taken<br/>that the experiment might succeed.<br/><br/>The weather having cleared, the settlers climbed the height<br/>above Granite House. There, on the plateau, they chose a spot, well<br/>sheltered from the wind, and exposed to all the heat of the midday<br/>sun. The place was cleared, carefully weeded, and searched for<br/>insects and worms; then a bed of good earth, improved with a little<br/>lime, was made; it was surrounded by a railing; and the grain was<br/>buried in the damp earth.<br/><br/>Did it not seem as if the settlers were laying the first stone<br/>of some edifice? It recalled to Pencroft the day on which he<br/>lighted his only match, and all the anxiety of the operation. But<br/>this time the thing was more serious. In fact, the castaways would<br/>have been always able to procure fire, in some mode or other, but<br/>no human power could supply another grain of corn, if unfortunately<br/>this should be lost!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
