However, Gideon Spilett wished without further delay to
reconnoiter the approaches to the corral, and Pencroft, who was
quite out of patience, volunteered to accompany him.

"No, my friends," said the engineer, "wait till night. I will
not allow one of you to expose himself in open day."

"But, captainâ€”" answered the sailor, little disposed to
obey.

"I beg of you, Pencroft," said the engineer.

"Very well!" replied the sailor, who vented his anger in another
way, by bestowing on the convicts the worst names in his maritime
vocabulary.

The colonists remained, therefore, near the cart, and carefully
watched the neighboring parts of the forest.

Three hours passed thus. The wind had fallen, and absolute
silence reigned under the great trees. The snapping of the smallest
twig, a footstep on the dry leaves, the gliding of a body among the
grass, would have been heard without difficulty. All was quiet.
Besides, Top, lying on the grass, his head stretched out on his
paws, gave no sign of uneasiness. At eight o'clock the day appeared
far enough advanced for the reconnaissance to be made under
favorable conditions. Gideon Spilett declared himself ready to set
out accompanied by Pencroft. Cyrus Harding consented. Top and Jup
were to remain with the engineer, Herbert, and Neb, for a bark or a
cry at a wrong moment would give the alarm.

"Do not be imprudent," said Harding to the reporter and
Pencroft, "you have not to gain possession of the corral, but only
to find out whether it is occupied or not."

"All right," answered Pencroft.

And the two departed.
