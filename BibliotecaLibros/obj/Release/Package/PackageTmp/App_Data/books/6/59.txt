"Pooh!"

"Nor any means of relighting it!"

"Nonsense!"

"But I say, Mr. Spilett—"

"Isn't Cyrus here?" replied the reporter.

"Is not our engineer alive? He will soon find some way of making
fire for us!"

"With what?"

"With nothing."

What had Pencroft to say? He could say nothing, for, in the
bottom of his heart he shared the confidence which his companions
had in Cyrus Harding. The engineer was to them a microcosm, a
compound of every science, a possessor of all human knowledge. It
was better to be with Cyrus in a desert island, than without him in
the most flourishing town in the United States. With him they could
want nothing; with him they would never despair. If these brave men
had been told that a volcanic eruption would destroy the land, that
this land would be engulfed in the depths of the Pacific, they
would have imperturbably replied,—

"Cyrus is here!"

While in the palanquin, however, the engineer had again relapsed
into unconsciousness, which the jolting to which he had been
subjected during his journey had brought on, so that they could not
now appeal to his ingenuity. The supper must necessarily be very
meager. In fact, all the grouse flesh had been consumed, and there
no longer existed any means of cooking more game. Besides, the
couroucous which had been reserved had disappeared. They must
consider what was to be done.
