While strolling along the shore about two miles from Granite
House, Herbert and Neb were fortunate enough to capture a
magnificent specimen of the order of chelonia. It was a turtle of
the species Midas, the edible green turtle, so called from the
color both of its shell and fat.

Herbert caught sight of this turtle as it was crawling among the
rocks to reach the sea.

"Help, Neb, help!" he cried.

Neb ran up.

"What a fine animal!" said Neb; "but how are we to catch
it?"

"Nothing is easier, Neb," replied Herbert. "We have only to turn
the turtle on its back, and it cannot possibly get away. Take your
spear and do as I do."

The reptile, aware of danger, had retired between its carapace
and plastron. They no longer saw its head or feet, and it was
motionless as a rock.

Herbert and Neb then drove their sticks underneath the animal,
and by their united efforts managed without difficulty to turn it
on its back. The turtle, which was three feet in length, would have
weighed at least four hundred pounds.

"Capital!" cried Neb; "this is something which will rejoice
friend Pencroft's heart."

In fact, the heart of friend Pencroft could not fail to be
rejoiced, for the flesh of the turtle, which feeds on wrack-grass,
is extremely savory. At this moment the creature's head could be
seen, which was small, flat, but widened behind by the large
temporal fossae hidden under the long roof.
