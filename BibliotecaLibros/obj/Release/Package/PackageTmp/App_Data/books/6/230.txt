"Why not donkeys?" asked Neb.

"Because they have not long ears, and their shape is more
graceful!"

"Donkeys or horses," interrupted Pencroft, "they are 'moving
powers,' as the captain would say, and as such must be
captured!"

The sailor, without frightening the animals, crept through the
grass to the bridge over Creek Glycerine, lowered it, and the
onagers were prisoners.

Now, should they seize them with violence and master them by
force? No. It was decided that for a few days they should be
allowed to roam freely about the plateau, where there was an
abundance of grass, and the engineer immediately began to prepare a
stable near the poultry-yard, in which the onagers might find food,
with a good litter, and shelter during the night.

This done, the movements of the two magnificent creatures were
left entirely free, and the settlers avoided even approaching them
so as to terrify them. Several times, however, the onagers appeared
to wish to leave the plateau, too confined for animals accustomed
to the plains and forests. They were then seen following the
water-barrier which everywhere presented itself before them,
uttering short neighs, then galloping through the grass, and
becoming calmer, they would remain entire hours gazing at the
woods, from which they were cut off for ever!

In the meantime harness of vegetable fiber had been
manufactured, and some days after the capture of the onagers, not
only the cart was ready, but a straight road, or rather a cutting,
had been made through the forests of the Far West, from the angle
of the Mercy to Port Balloon. The cart might then be driven there,
and towards the end of December they tried the onagers for the
first time.

Pencroft had already coaxed the animals to come and eat out of
his hand, and they allowed him to approach without making any
difficulty, but once harnessed they reared and could with
difficulty be held in. However, it was not long before they
submitted to this new service, for the onager, being less
refractory than the zebra, is frequently put in harness in the
mountainous regions of Southern Africa, and it has even been
acclimatized in Europe, under zones of a relative coolness.

On this day all the colony, except Pencroft who walked at the
animals' heads, mounted the cart, and set out on the road to Port
Balloon.

Of course they were jolted over the somewhat rough road, but the
vehicle arrived without any accident, and was soon loaded with the
case and rigging of the balloon.

At eight o'clock that evening the cart, after passing over the
Mercy bridge, descended the left bank of the river, and stopped on
the beach. The onagers being unharnessed, were thence led to their
stable, and Pencroft before going to sleep gave vent to his
feelings in a deep sigh of satisfaction that awoke all the echoes
of Granite House.
