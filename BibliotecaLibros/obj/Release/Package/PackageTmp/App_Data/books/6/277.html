<br/>Thus it had been agreed that Cyrus Harding, Neb, and Gideon<br/>Spilett should remain at Granite House, but an objection was<br/>raised, and Spilett, who had not forgotten his business as reporter<br/>to the New York Herald, having declared that he would go by<br/>swimming rather than lose such an opportunity, he was admitted to<br/>take a part in the voyage.<br/><br/>The evening was occupied in transporting on board the<br/>"Bonadventure," articles of bedding, utensils, arms, ammunition, a<br/>compass, provisions for a week; this being rapidly done, the<br/>colonists ascended to Granite House.<br/><br/>The next day, at five o'clock in the morning, the farewells were<br/>said, not without some emotion on both sides, and Pencroft setting<br/>sail made towards Claw Cape, which had to be doubled in order to<br/>proceed to the southwest.<br/><br/>The "Bonadventure" was already a quarter of a mile from the<br/>coast when the passengers perceived on the heights of Granite House<br/>two men waving their farewells; they were Cyrus Harding and<br/>Neb.<br/><br/>"Our friends," exclaimed Spilett, "this is our first separation<br/>in fifteen months."<br/><br/>Pencroft, the reporter and Herbert waved in return, and Granite<br/>House soon disappeared behind the high rocks of the Cape.<br/><br/>During the first part of the day the "Bonadventure" was still in<br/>sight of the southern coast of Lincoln Island, which soon appeared<br/>just like a green basket, with Mount Franklin rising from the<br/>center. The heights, diminished by distance, did not present an<br/>appearance likely to tempt vessels to touch there. Reptile End was<br/>passed in about an hour, though at a distance of about ten<br/>miles.<br/><br/>At this distance it was no longer possible to distinguish<br/>anything of the Western Coast, which stretched away to the ridges<br/>of Mount Franklin, and three hours after the last of Lincoln Island<br/>sank below the horizon.<br/><br/>The "Bonadventure" behaved capitally. Bounding over the waves<br/>she proceeded rapidly on her course. Pencroft had hoisted the<br/>foresail, and steering by the compass followed a rectilinear<br/>direction. From time to time Herbert relieved him at the helm, and<br/>the lad's hand was so firm that the sailor had not a point to find<br/>fault with.<br/><br/>Gideon Spilett chatted sometimes with one, sometimes with the<br/>other, if wanted he lent a hand with the ropes, and Captain<br/>Pencroft was perfectly satisfied with his crew.<br/><br/>
