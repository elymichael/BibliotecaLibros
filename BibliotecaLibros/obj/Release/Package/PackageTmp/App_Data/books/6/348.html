To the enormous lava rocks succeeded soon those capricious sand<br/>dunes, among which the engineer had been so singularly recovered,<br/>and which seabirds frequented in thousands.<br/><br/>About four o'clock, Pencroft leaving the point of the islet on<br/>his left, entered the channel which separated it from the coast,<br/>and at five o'clock the anchor of the "Bonadventure" was buried in<br/>the sand at the mouth of the Mercy.<br/><br/>The colonists had been absent three days from their dwelling.<br/>Ayrton was waiting for them on the beach, and Jup came joyously to<br/>meet them, giving vent to deep grunts of satisfaction.<br/><br/>A complete exploration of the coast of the island had now been<br/>made, and no suspicious appearances had been observed. If any<br/>mysterious being resided on it, it could only be under cover of the<br/>impenetrable forest of the Serpentine Peninsula, to which the<br/>colonists had not yet directed their investigations.<br/><br/>Gideon Spilett discussed these things with the engineer, and it<br/>was agreed that they should direct the attention of their<br/>companions to the strange character of certain incidents which had<br/>occurred on the island, and of which the last was the most<br/>unaccountable.<br/><br/>However, Harding, returning to the fact of a fire having been<br/>kindled on the shore by an unknown hand, could not refrain from<br/>repeating for the twentieth time to the reporter,—<br/><br/>"But are you quite sure of having seen it? Was it not a partial<br/>eruption of the volcano, or perhaps some meteor?"<br/><br/>"No, Cyrus," answered the reporter, "it was certainly a fire<br/>lighted by the hand of man. Besides; question Pencroft and Herbert.<br/>They saw it as I saw it myself, and they will confirm my<br/>words."<br/><br/>In consequence, therefore, a few days after, on the 25th of<br/>April, in the evening, when the settlers were all collected on<br/>Prospect Heights, Cyrus Harding began by saying,—<br/><br/>"My friends, I think it my duty to call your attention to<br/>certain incidents which have occurred in the island, on the subject<br/>of which I shall be happy to have your advice. These incidents are,<br/>so to speak, supernatural—"<br/><br/>"Supernatural!" exclaimed the sailor, emitting a volume of smoke<br/>from his mouth. "Can it be possible that our island is<br/>supernatural?"<br/>
