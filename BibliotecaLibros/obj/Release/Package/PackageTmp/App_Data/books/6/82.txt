"Well, now let us set off to the Chimneys!" cried Pencroft.

"One minute, my friends," said the engineer. "It seems to me it
would be a good thing to give a name to this island, as well as to,
the capes, promontories, and watercourses, which we can see.

"Very good," said the reporter. "In the future, that will
simplify the instructions which we shall have to give and
follow."

"Indeed," said the sailor, "already it is something to be able
to say where one is going, and where one has come from. At least,
it looks like somewhere."

"The Chimneys, for example," said Herbert.

"Exactly!" replied Pencroft. "That name was the most convenient,
and it came to me quite of myself. Shall we keep the name of the
Chimneys for our first encampment, captain?"

"Yes, Pencroft, since you have so christened it."

"Good! as for the others, that will be easy," returned the
sailor, who was in high spirits. "Let us give them names, as the
Robinsons did, whose story Herbert has often read to me; Providence
Bay, Whale Point, Cape Disappointment!"

"Or, rather, the names of Captain Harding," said Herbert, "of
Mr. Spilett, of Neb!—"

"My name!" cried Neb, showing his sparkling white teeth.

"Why not?" replied Pencroft. "Port Neb, that would do very well!
And Cape Gideon—"
