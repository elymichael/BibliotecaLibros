<br/>"Hurrah for Bob Harvey!"<br/><br/>What Ayrton felt when he overheard this fragment of conversation<br/>may be understood when it is known that in this Bob Harvey he<br/>recognized one of his old Australian companions, a daring sailor,<br/>who had continued his criminal career. Bob Harvey had seized, on<br/>the shores of Norfolk Island this brig, which was loaded with arms,<br/>ammunition, utensils, and tools of all sorts, destined for one of<br/>the Sandwich Islands. All his gang had gone on board, and pirates<br/>after having been convicts, these wretches, more ferocious than the<br/>Malays themselves, scoured the Pacific, destroying vessels, and<br/>massacring their crews.<br/><br/>The convicts spoke loudly, they recounted their deeds, drinking<br/>deeply at the same time, and this is what Ayrton gathered. The<br/>actual crew of the "Speedy" was composed solely of English<br/>prisoners, escaped from Norfolk Island.<br/><br/>Here it may be well to explain what this island was. In 29deg 2'<br/>south latitude, and 165deg 42' east longitude, to the east of<br/>Australia, is found a little island, six miles in circumference,<br/>overlooked by Mount Pitt, which rises to a height of 1,100 feet<br/>above the level of the sea. This is Norfolk Island, once the seat<br/>of an establishment in which were lodged the most intractable<br/>convicts from the English penitentiaries. They numbered 500, under<br/>an iron discipline, threatened with terrible punishments, and were<br/>guarded by 150 soldiers, and 150 employed under the orders of the<br/>governor. It would be difficult to imagine a collection of greater<br/>ruffians. Sometimes,—although very rarely,—notwithstanding the<br/>extreme surveillance of which they were the object, many managed to<br/>escape, and seizing vessels which they surprised, they infested the<br/>Polynesian Archipelagoes.<br/><br/>Thus had Bob Harvey and his companions done. Thus had Ayrton<br/>formerly wished to do. Bob Harvey had seized the brig "Speedy,"<br/>anchored in sight of Norfolk Island; the crew had been massacred;<br/>and for a year this ship had scoured the Pacific, under the command<br/>of Harvey, now a pirate, and well known to Ayrton!<br/><br/>The convicts were, for the most part, assembled under the poop;<br/>but a few, stretched on the deck, were talking loudly.<br/><br/>The conversation still continued amid shouts and libations.<br/>Ayrton learned that chance alone had brought the "Speedy" in sight<br/>of Lincoln Island; Bob Harvey had never yet set foot on it; but, as<br/>Cyrus Harding had conjectured, finding this unknown land in his<br/>course, its position being marked on no chart, he had formed the<br/>project of visiting it, and, if he found it suitable, of making it<br/>the brig's headquarters.<br/><br/>As to the black flag hoisted at the "Speedy's" peak, and the gun<br/>which had been fired, in imitation of men-of-war when they lower<br/>their colors, it was pure piratical bravado. It was in no way a<br/>signal, and no communication yet existed between the convicts and<br/>Lincoln Island.<br/><br/>The settlers' domain was now menaced with terrible danger.<br/>Evidently the island, with its water, its harbor, its resources of<br/>all kinds so increased in value by the colonists, and the<br/>concealment afforded by Granite House, could not but be convenient<br/>for the convicts; in their hands it would become an excellent place<br/>of refuge, and, being unknown, it would assure them, for a long<br/>time perhaps, impunity and security. Evidently, also, the lives of<br/>the settlers would not be respected, and Bob Harvey and his<br/>accomplices' first care would be to massacre them without mercy.<br/>Harding and his companions had, therefore, not even the choice of<br/>flying and hiding themselves in the island, since the convicts<br/>intended to reside there, and since, in the event of the "Speedy"<br/>departing on an expedition, it was probable that some of the crew<br/>would remain on shore, so as to settle themselves there. Therefore,<br/>it would be necessary to fight, to destroy every one of these<br/>scoundrels, unworthy of pity, and against whom any means would be<br/>right. So thought Ayrton, and he well knew that Cyrus Harding would<br/>be of his way of thinking.<br/><br/>But was resistance and, in the last place, victory possible?<br/>That would depend on the equipment of the brig, and the number of<br/>men which she carried.<br/><br/>
