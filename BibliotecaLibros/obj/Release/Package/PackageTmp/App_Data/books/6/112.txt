These were the seals which were to be captured. It was
necessary, however, first to allow them to land, for with their
close, short hair, and their fusiform conformation, being excellent
swimmers, it is difficult to catch them in the sea, while on land
their short, webbed feet prevent their having more than a slow,
waddling movement.

Pencroft knew the habits of these creatures, and he advised
waiting till they were stretched on the sand, when the sun, before
long, would send them to sleep. They must then manage to cut off
their retreat and knock them on the head.

The hunters, having concealed themselves behind the rocks,
waited silently.

An hour passed before the seals came to play on the sand. They
could count half a dozen. Pencroft and Herbert then went round the
point of the islet, so as to take them in the rear, and cut off
their retreat. During this time Cyrus Harding, Spilett, and Neb,
crawling behind the rocks, glided towards the future scene of
combat.

All at once the tall figure of the sailor appeared. Pencroft
shouted. The engineer and his two companions threw themselves
between the sea and the seals. Two of the animals soon lay dead on
the sand, but the rest regained the sea in safety.

"Here are the seals required, captain!" said the sailor,
advancing towards the engineer.

"Capital," replied Harding. "We will make bellows of them!"

"Bellows!" cried Pencroft. "Well! these are lucky seals!"

It was, in fact, a blowing-machine, necessary for the treatment
of the ore that the engineer wished to manufacture with the skins
of the amphibious creatures. They were of a medium size, for their
length did not exceed six feet. They resembled a dog about the
head.

As it was useless to burden themselves with the weight of both
the animals, Neb and Pencroft resolved to skin them on the spot,
while Cyrus Harding and the reporter continued to explore the
islet.
