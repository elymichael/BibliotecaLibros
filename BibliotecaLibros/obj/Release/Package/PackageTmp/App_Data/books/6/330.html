<br/>"Nor was it he who threw it in, my dear Spilett."<br/><br/>"You think then—"<br/><br/>"I think nothing, I know nothing!" interrupted Cyrus Harding. "I<br/>am content to rank this incident among those which I have not been<br/>able to explain to this day!"<br/><br/>"Indeed, Cyrus," said Spilett, "these things are incredible!<br/>Your rescue, the case stranded on the sand, Top's adventure, and<br/>lastly this bottle… Shall we never have the answer to these<br/>enigmas?"<br/><br/>"Yes!" replied the engineer quickly, "yes, even if I have to<br/>penetrate into the bowels of this island!"<br/><br/>"Chance will perhaps give us the key to this mystery!"<br/><br/>"Chance! Spilett! I do not believe in chance, any more than I<br/>believe in mysteries in this world. There is a reason for<br/>everything unaccountable which has happened here, and that reason I<br/>shall discover. But in the meantime we must work and observe."<br/><br/>The month of January arrived. The year 1867 commenced. The<br/>summer occupations were assiduously continued. During the days<br/>which followed, Herbert and Spilett having gone in the direction of<br/>the corral, ascertained that Ayrton had taken possession of the<br/>habitation which had been prepared for him. He busied himself with<br/>the numerous flock confided to his care, and spared his companions<br/>the trouble of coming every two or three days to visit the corral.<br/>Nevertheless, in order not to leave Ayrton in solitude for too long<br/>a time, the settlers often paid him a visit.<br/><br/>It was not unimportant either, in consequence of some suspicions<br/>entertained by the engineer and Gideon Spilett, that this part of<br/>the island should be subject to a surveillance of some sort, and<br/>that Ayrton, if any incident occurred unexpectedly, should not<br/>neglect to inform the inhabitants of Granite House of it.<br/><br/>Nevertheless it might happen that something would occur which it<br/>would be necessary to bring rapidly to the engineer's knowledge.<br/>Independently of facts bearing on the mystery of Lincoln Island,<br/>many others might happen, which would call for the prompt<br/>interference of the colonists,—such as the sighting of a vessel, a<br/>wreck on the western coast, the possible arrival of pirates,<br/>etc.<br/><br/>
