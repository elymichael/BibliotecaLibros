"What o'clock is it?" asked Gideon Spilett.

"Ten."

"In an hour he may be here. We will watch for his return."

The gate of the corral was closed. The engineer and the reporter
re-entered the house. Herbert was still in a sleep. Pencroft kept
the compresser always wet. Spilett, seeing there was nothing he
could do at that moment, busied himself in preparing some
nourishment, while attentively watching that part of the enclosure
against the hill, at which an attack might be expected.

The settlers awaited Top's return with much anxiety. A little
before eleven o'clock, Cyrus Harding and the reporter, rifle in
hand, were behind the gate, ready to open it at the first bark of
their dog.

They did not doubt that if Top had arrived safely at Granite
House, Neb would have sent him back immediately.

They had both been there for about ten minutes, when a report
was heard, followed by repeated barks.

The engineer opened the gate, and seeing smoke a hundred feet
off in the wood, he fired in that direction.

Almost immediately Top bounded into the corral, and the gate was
quickly shut.

"Top, Top!" exclaimed the engineer, taking the dog's great
honest head between his hands.

A note was fastened to his neck, and Cyrus Harding read these
words, traced in Neb's large writing:â€”"No pirates in the
neighborhood of Granite House. I will not stir. Poor Mr.
Herbert!"
