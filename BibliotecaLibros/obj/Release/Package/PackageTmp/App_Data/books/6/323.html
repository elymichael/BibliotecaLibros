<br/>"Ayrton, arrived at Melbourne, delivered the letter to the mate,<br/>Tom Austin, who read it and immediately set sail, but judge of<br/>Ayrton's rage and disappointment, when the next day he found that<br/>the mate was taking the vessel, not to the east coast of Australia,<br/>to Twofold Bay, but to the east coast of New Zealand. He wished to<br/>stop him, but Austin showed him the letter!â€¦ And indeed, by a<br/>providential error of the French geographer, who had written the<br/>letter, the east coast of New Zealand was mentioned as the place of<br/>destination.<br/><br/>"All Ayrton's plans were frustrated! He became outrageous. They<br/>put him in irons. He was then taken to the coast of New Zealand,<br/>not knowing what would become of his accomplices, or what would<br/>become of Lord Glenarvan.<br/><br/>"The 'Duncan' cruised about on this coast until the 3rd of<br/>March. On that day Ayrton heard the report of guns. The guns on the<br/>'Duncan' were being fired, and soon Lord Glenarvan and his<br/>companions came on board.<br/><br/>"This is what had happened.<br/><br/>"After a thousand hardships, a thousand dangers, Lord Glenarvan<br/>had accomplished his journey, and arrived on the east coast of<br/>Australia, at Twofold Bay. 'Not "Duncan!"' He telegraphed to<br/>Melbourne. They answered, '"Duncan" sailed on the 18th instant.<br/>Destination unknown.'<br/><br/>"Lord Glenarvan could only arrive at one conclusion; that his<br/>honest yacht had fallen into the hands of Ben Joyce, and had become<br/>a pirate vessel!<br/><br/>"However, Lord Glenarvan would not give up. He was a bold and<br/>generous man. He embarked in a merchant vessel, sailed to the west<br/>coast of New Zealand, traversed it along the thirty-seventh<br/>parallel, without finding any trace of Captain Grant; but on the<br/>other side, to his great surprise, and by the will of Heaven, he<br/>found the 'Duncan,' under command of the mate, who had been waiting<br/>for him for five weeks!<br/><br/>"This was on the 3rd of March, 1855. Lord Glenarvan was now on<br/>board the 'Duncan,' but Ayrton was there also. He appeared before<br/>the nobleman, who wished to extract from him all that the villain<br/>knew about Captain Grant. Ayrton refused to speak. Lord Glenarvan<br/>then told him, that at the first port they put into, he would be<br/>delivered up to the English authorities. Ayrton remained mute.<br/><br/>"The 'Duncan' continued her voyage along the thirty-seventh<br/>parallel. In the meanwhile, Lady Glenarvan undertook to vanquish<br/>the resistance of the ruffian.<br/><br/>"At last, her influence prevailed, and Ayrton, in exchange for<br/>what he could tell, proposed that Lord Glenarvan should leave him<br/>on some island in the Pacific, instead of giving him up to the<br/>English authorities. Lord Glenarvan, resolving to do anything to<br/>obtain information about Captain Grant, consented.<br/><br/>
