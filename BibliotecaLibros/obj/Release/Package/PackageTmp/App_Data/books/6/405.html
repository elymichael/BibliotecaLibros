<br/>"Indeed," remarked the reporter, "it will be important to take a<br/>document there which will make known the situation of Lincoln<br/>Island, and Ayrton's new residence, in case the Scotch yacht<br/>returns to fetch him."<br/><br/>"Well, the 'Bonadventure' is always there, Mr. Spilett,"<br/>answered the sailor.
