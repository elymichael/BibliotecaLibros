"What we shall do, my friends? What we ought to do is this:—we<br/>will communicate with the ship, we will take our passage on board<br/>her, and we will leave our island, after having taken possession of<br/>it in the name of the United States. Then we will return with any<br/>who may wish to follow us to colonize it definitely, and endow the<br/>American Republic with a useful station in this part of the Pacific<br/>Ocean!"<br/><br/>"Hurrah!" exclaimed Pencroft, "and that will be no small present<br/>which we shall make to our country! The colonization is already<br/>almost finished; names are given to every part of the island; there<br/>is a natural port, fresh water, roads, a telegraph, a dockyard, and<br/>manufactories; and there will be nothing to be done but to inscribe<br/>Lincoln Island on the maps!"<br/><br/>"But if anyone seizes it in our absence?" observed Gideon<br/>Spilett.<br/><br/>"Hang it!" cried the sailor. "I would rather remain all alone to<br/>guard it: and trust to Pencroft, they shouldn't steal it from him,<br/>like a watch from the pocket of a swell!"<br/><br/>For an hour it was impossible to say with any certainty whether<br/>the vessel was or was not standing towards Lincoln Island. She was<br/>nearer, but in what direction was she sailing? This Pencroft could<br/>not determine. However, as the wind was blowing from the northeast,<br/>in all probability the vessel was sailing on the starboard tack.<br/>Besides, the wind was favorable for bringing her towards the<br/>island, and, the sea being calm, she would not be afraid to<br/>approach although the shallows were not marked on the chart.<br/><br/>Towards four o'clock—an hour after he had been sent for—Ayrton<br/>arrived at Granite House. He entered the dining-room saying,—<br/><br/>"At your service, gentlemen."<br/><br/>Cyrus Harding gave him his hand, as was his custom to do, and,<br/>leading him to the window,—<br/><br/>"Ayrton," said he, "we have begged you to come here for an<br/>important reason. A ship is in sight of the island."<br/><br/>Ayrton at first paled slightly, and for a moment his eyes became<br/>dim; then, leaning out the window, he surveyed the horizon, but<br/>could see nothing.<br/><br/>"Take this telescope," said Spilett, "and look carefully,<br/>Ayrton, for it is possible that this ship may be the 'Duncan' come<br/>to these seas for the purpose of taking you home again."<br/>
