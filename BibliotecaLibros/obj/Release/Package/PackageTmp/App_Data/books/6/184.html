<br/>"Nothing is wanting, indeed," murmured Cyrus Harding<br/>thoughtfully.<br/><br/>"And for a certainty," added Herbert, "the vessel which carried<br/>this chest and its owner was not a Malay pirate!"<br/><br/>"Unless," said Pencroft, "the owner had been taken prisoner by<br/>pirates—"<br/><br/>"That is not admissible," replied the reporter. "It is more<br/>probable that an American or European vessel has been driven into<br/>this quarter, and that her passengers, wishing to save necessaries<br/>at least, prepared this chest and threw it overboard."<br/><br/>"Is that your opinion, captain?" asked Herbert.<br/><br/>"Yes, my boy," replied the engineer, "that may have been the<br/>case. It is possible that at the moment, or in expectation of a<br/>wreck, they collected into this chest different articles of the<br/>greatest use in hopes of finding it again on the coast—"<br/><br/>"Even the photographic box!" exclaimed the sailor<br/>incredulously.<br/><br/>"As to that apparatus," replied Harding, "I do not quite see the<br/>use of it; and a more complete supply of clothes or more abundant<br/>ammunition would have been more valuable to us as well as to any<br/>other castaways!"<br/><br/>"But isn't there any mark or direction on these instruments,<br/>tools, or books, which would tell us something about them?" asked<br/>Gideon Spilett.<br/><br/>That might be ascertained. Each article was carefully examined,<br/>especially the books, instruments and weapons. Neither the weapons<br/>nor the instruments, contrary to the usual custom, bore the name of<br/>the maker; they were, besides, in a perfect state, and did not<br/>appear to have been used. The same peculiarity marked the tools and<br/>utensils; all were new, which proved that the articles had not been<br/>taken by chance and thrown into the chest, but, on the contrary,<br/>that the choice of things had been well considered and arranged<br/>with care. This was also indicated by the second case of metal<br/>which had preserved them from damp, and which could not have been<br/>soldered in a moment of haste.<br/><br/>
