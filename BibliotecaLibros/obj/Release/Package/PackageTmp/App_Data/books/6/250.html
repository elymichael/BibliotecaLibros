And the sailor brandishing the harpoon, repeated, not without<br/>emotion, the name which he loved so wellâ€”the name of his<br/>birthplace.<br/><br/>But as it could not be expected that the "Maria Stella" would<br/>come to reclaim the animal harpooned by her, they resolved to begin<br/>cutting it up before decomposition should commence. The birds, who<br/>had watched this rich prey for several days, had determined to take<br/>possession of it without further delay, and it was necessary to<br/>drive them off by firing at them repeatedly.<br/><br/>The whale was a female, and a large quantity of milk was taken<br/>from it, which, according to the opinion of the naturalist<br/>Duffenbach, might pass for cow's milk, and, indeed, it differs from<br/>it neither in taste, color, nor density.<br/><br/>Pencroft had formerly served on board a whaling-ship, and he<br/>could methodically direct the operation of cutting up, a<br/>sufficiently disagreeable operation lasting three days, but from<br/>which the settlers did not flinch, not even Gideon Spilett, who, as<br/>the sailor said, would end by making a "real good castaway."<br/><br/>The blubber, cut in parallel slices of two feet and a half in<br/>thickness, then divided into pieces which might weigh about a<br/>thousand pounds each, was melted down in large earthen pots brought<br/>to the spot, for they did not wish to taint the environs of Granite<br/>House, and in this fusion it lost nearly a third of its weight.<br/><br/>But there was an immense quantity of it; the tongue alone<br/>yielded six thousand pounds of oil, and the lower lip four<br/>thousand. Then, besides the fat, which would insure for a long time<br/>a store of stearine and glycerine, there were still the bones, for<br/>which a use could doubtless be found, although there were neither<br/>umbrellas nor stays used at Granite House. The upper part of the<br/>mouth of the cetacean was, indeed, provided on both sides with<br/>eight hundred horny blades, very elastic, of a fibrous texture, and<br/>fringed at the edge like great combs, at which the teeth, six feet<br/>long, served to retain the thousands of animalculae, little fish,<br/>and molluscs, on which the whale fed.<br/><br/>The operation finished, to the great satisfaction of the<br/>operators, the remains of the animal were left to the birds, who<br/>would soon make every vestige of it disappear, and their usual<br/>daily occupations were resumed by the inmates of Granite House.<br/><br/>However, before returning to the dockyard, Cyrus Harding<br/>conceived the idea of fabricating certain machines, which greatly<br/>excited the curiosity of his companions. He took a dozen of the<br/>whale's bones, cut them into six equal parts, and sharpened their<br/>ends.<br/><br/>"This machine is not my own invention, and it is frequently<br/>employed by the Aleutian hunters in Russian America. You see these<br/>bones, my friends; well, when it freezes, I will bend them, and<br/>then wet them with water till they are entirely covered with ice,<br/>which will keep them bent, and I will strew them on the snow,<br/>having previously covered them with fat. Now, what will happen if a<br/>hungry animal swallows one of these baits? Why, the heat of his<br/>stomach will melt the ice, and the bone, springing straight, will<br/>pierce him with its sharp points."<br/><br/>"Well! I do call that ingenious!" said Pencroft.<br/><br/>"And it will spare the powder and shot," rejoined Cyrus<br/>Harding.<br/>
