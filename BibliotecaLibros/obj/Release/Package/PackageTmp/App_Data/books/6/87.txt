"Consequently, your watch is set by the meridian of that town,
which is almost that of Washington?"

"Undoubtedly."

"Very well, keep it thus. Content yourself with winding it up
very, exactly, but do not touch the hands. This may be of use to
us.

"What will be the good of that?" thought the sailor.

They ate, and so heartily, that the store of game and almonds
was totally exhausted. But Pencroft was not at all uneasy, they
would supply themselves on the way. Top, whose share had been very
much to his taste, would know how to find some fresh game among the
brushwood. Moreover, the sailor thought of simply asking the
engineer to manufacture some powder and one or two fowling-pieces;
he supposed there would be no difficulty in that.

On leaving the plateau, the captain proposed to his companions
to return to the Chimneys by a new way. He wished to reconnoiter
Lake Grant, so magnificently framed in trees. They therefore
followed the crest of one of the spurs, between which the creek
that supplied the lake probably had its source. In talking, the
settlers already employed the names which they had just chosen,
which singularly facilitated the exchange of their ideas. Herbert
and Pencroft—the one young and the other very boyish—were
enchanted, and while walking, the sailor said,

"Hey, Herbert! how capital it sounds! It will be impossible to
lose ourselves, my boy, since, whether we follow the way to Lake
Grant, or whether we join the Mercy through the woods of the Far
West, we shall be certain to arrive at Prospect Heights, and,
consequently, at Union Bay!"

It had been agreed, that without forming a compact band, the
settlers should not stray away from each other. It was very certain
that the thick forests of the island were inhabited by dangerous
animals, and it was prudent to be on their guard. In general,
Pencroft, Herbert, and Neb walked first, preceded by Top, who poked
his nose into every bush. The reporter and the engineer went
together, Gideon Spilett ready to note every incident, the engineer
silent for the most part, and only stepping aside to pick up one
thing or another, a mineral or vegetable substance, which he put
into his pocket, without making any remark.

"What can he be picking up?" muttered Pencroft. "I have looked
in vain for anything that's worth the trouble of stooping for."

Towards ten o'clock the little band descended the last
declivities of Mount Franklin. As yet the ground was scantily
strewn with bushes and trees. They were walking over yellowish
calcinated earth, forming a plain of nearly a mile long, which
extended to the edge of the wood. Great blocks of that basalt,
which, according to Bischof, takes three hundred and fifty millions
of years to cool, strewed the plain, very confused in some places.
However, there were here no traces of lava, which was spread more
particularly over the northern slopes.

Cyrus Harding expected to reach, without incident, the course of
the creek, which he supposed flowed under the trees at the border
of the plain, when he saw Herbert running hastily back, while Neb
and the sailor were hiding behind the rocks.
