<br/>From the age of ten years to that of thirty Prince Dakkar,<br/>endowed by Nature with her richest gifts of intellect, accumulated<br/>knowledge of every kind, and in science, literature, and art his<br/>researches were extensive and profound.<br/><br/>He traveled over the whole of Europe. His rank and fortune<br/>caused him to be everywhere sought after; but the pleasures of the<br/>world had for him no attractions. Though young and possessed of<br/>every personal advantage, he was ever grave—somber even—devoured by<br/>an unquenchable thirst for knowledge, and cherishing in the<br/>recesses of his heart the hope that he might become a great and<br/>powerful ruler of a free and enlightened people.<br/><br/>Still, for long the love of science triumphed over all other<br/>feelings. He became an artist deeply impressed by the marvels of<br/>art, a philosopher to whom no one of the higher sciences was<br/>unknown, a statesman versed in the policy of European courts. To<br/>the eyes of those who observed him superficially he might have<br/>passed for one of those cosmopolitans, curious of knowledge, but<br/>disdaining action; one of those opulent travelers, haughty and<br/>cynical, who move incessantly from place to place, and are of no<br/>country.<br/><br/>The history of Captain Nemo has, in fact, been published under<br/>the title of "Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea." Here,<br/>therefore, will apply the observation already made as to the<br/>adventures of Ayrton with regard to the discrepancy of dates.<br/>Readers should therefore refer to the note already published on<br/>this point.<br/><br/>This artist, this philosopher, this man was, however, still<br/>cherishing the hope instilled into him from his earliest days.<br/><br/>Prince Dakkar returned to Bundelkund in the year 1849. He<br/>married a noble Indian lady, who was imbued with an ambition not<br/>less ardent than that by which he was inspired. Two children were<br/>born to them, whom they tenderly loved. But domestic happiness did<br/>not prevent him from seeking to carry out the object at which he<br/>aimed. He waited an opportunity. At length, as he vainly fancied,<br/>it presented itself.<br/><br/>Instigated by princes equally ambitious and less sagacious and<br/>more unscrupulous than he was, the people of India were persuaded<br/>that they might successfully rise against their English rulers, who<br/>had brought them out of a state of anarchy and constant warfare and<br/>misery, and had established peace and prosperity in their country.<br/>Their ignorance and gross superstition made them the facile tools<br/>of their designing chiefs.<br/><br/>In 1857 the great sepoy revolt broke out. Prince Dakkar, under<br/>the belief that he should thereby have the opportunity of attaining<br/>the object of his long-cherished ambition, was easily drawn into<br/>it. He forthwith devoted his talents and wealth to the service of<br/>this cause. He aided it in person; he fought in the front ranks; he<br/>risked his life equally with the humblest of the wretched and<br/>misguided fanatics; he was ten times wounded in twenty engagements,<br/>seeking death but finding it not, but at length the sanguinary<br/>rebels were utterly defeated, and the atrocious mutiny was brought<br/>to an end.<br/><br/>Never before had the British power in India been exposed to such<br/>danger, and if, as they had hoped, the sepoys had received<br/>assistance from without, the influence and supremacy in Asia of the<br/>United Kingdom would have been a thing of the past.<br/><br/>The name of Prince Dakkar was at that time well known. He had<br/>fought openly and without concealment. A price was set upon his<br/>head, but he managed to escape from his pursuers.<br/><br/>
