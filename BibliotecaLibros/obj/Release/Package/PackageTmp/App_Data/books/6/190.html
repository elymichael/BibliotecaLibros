It was indeed a jacamar, of which the plumage shines with a<br/>metallic luster. A shot brought it to the ground, and Top carried<br/>it to the canoe. At the same time half a dozen lories were brought<br/>down. The lory is of the size of a pigeon, the plumage dashed with<br/>green, part of the wings crimson, and its crest bordered with<br/>white. To the young boy belonged the honor of this shot, and he was<br/>proud enough of it. Lories are better food than the jacamar, the<br/>flesh of which is rather tough, but it was difficult to persuade<br/>Pencroft that he had not killed the king of eatable birds. It was<br/>ten o'clock in the morning when the canoe reached a second angle of<br/>the Mercy, nearly five miles from its mouth. Here a halt was made<br/>for breakfast under the shade of some splendid trees. The river<br/>still measured from sixty to seventy feet in breadth, and its bed<br/>from five to six feet in depth. The engineer had observed that it<br/>was increased by numerous affluents, but they were unnavigable,<br/>being simply little streams. As to the forest, including Jacamar<br/>Wood, as well as the forests of the Far West, it extended as far as<br/>the eye could reach. In no place, either in the depths of the<br/>forests or under the trees on the banks of the Mercy, was the<br/>presence of man revealed. The explorers could not discover one<br/>suspicious trace. It was evident that the woodman's axe had never<br/>touched these trees, that the pioneer's knife had never severed the<br/>creepers hanging from one trunk to another in the midst of tangled<br/>brushwood and long grass. If castaways had landed on the island,<br/>they could not have yet quitted the shore, and it was not in the<br/>woods that the survivors of the supposed shipwreck should be<br/>sought.<br/><br/>The engineer therefore manifested some impatience to reach the<br/>western coast of Lincoln Island, which was at least five miles<br/>distant according to his estimation.<br/><br/>The voyage was continued, and as the Mercy appeared to flow not<br/>towards the shore, but rather towards Mount Franklin, it was<br/>decided that they should use the boat as long as there was enough<br/>water under its keel to float it. It was both fatigue spared and<br/>time gained, for they would have been obliged to cut a path through<br/>the thick wood with their axes. But soon the flow completely failed<br/>them, either the tide was going down, and it was about the hour, or<br/>it could no longer be felt at this distance from the mouth of the<br/>Mercy. They had therefore to make use of the oars. Herbert and Neb<br/>each took one, and Pencroft took the scull. The forest soon became<br/>less dense, the trees grew further apart and often quite isolated.<br/>But the further they were from each other the more magnificent they<br/>appeared, profiting, as they did, by the free, pure air which<br/>circulated around them.<br/><br/>What splendid specimens of the flora of this latitude! Certainly<br/>their presence would have been enough for a botanist to name<br/>without hesitation the parallel which traversed Lincoln Island.<br/><br/>"Eucalypti!" cried Herbert.<br/><br/>They were, in fact, those splendid trees, the giants of the<br/>extratropical zone, the congeners of the Australian and New Zealand<br/>eucalyptus, both situated under the same latitude as Lincoln<br/>Island. Some rose to a height of two hundred feet. Their trunks at<br/>the base measured twenty feet in circumference, and their bark was<br/>covered by a network of farrows containing a red, sweet-smelling<br/>gum. Nothing is more wonderful or more singular than those enormous<br/>specimens of the order of the myrtaceae, with their leaves placed<br/>vertically and not horizontally, so that an edge and not a surface<br/>looks upwards, the effect being that the sun's rays penetrate more<br/>freely among the trees.<br/><br/>The ground at the foot of the eucalypti was carpeted with grass,<br/>and from the bushes escaped flights of little birds, which<br/>glittered in the sunlight like winged rubies.<br/><br/>"These are something like trees!" cried Neb; "but are they good<br/>for anything?"<br/><br/>"Pooh!" replied Pencroft. "Of course there are vegetable giants<br/>as well as human giants, and they are no good, except to show<br/>themselves at fairs!"<br/><br/>"I think that you are mistaken, Pencroft," replied Gideon<br/>Spilett, "and that the wood of the eucalyptus has begun to be very<br/>advantageously employed in cabinet-making."<br/><br/>"And I may add," said Herbert, "that the eucalyptus belongs to a<br/>family which comprises many useful members; the guava-tree, from<br/>whose fruit guava jelly is made; the clove-tree, which produces the<br/>spice; the pomegranate- tree, which bears pomegranates; the<br/>Eugeacia Cauliflora, the fruit of which is used in making a<br/>tolerable wine; the Ugui myrtle, which contains an excellent<br/>alcoholic liquor; the Caryophyllus myrtle, of which the bark forms<br/>an esteemed cinnamon; the Eugenia Pimenta, from whence comes<br/>Jamaica pepper; the common myrtle, from whose buds and berries<br/>spice is sometimes made; the Eucalyptus manifera, which yields a<br/>sweet sort of manna; the Guinea Eucalyptus, the sap of which is<br/>transformed into beer by fermentation; in short, all those trees<br/>known under the name of gum-trees or iron-bark trees in Australia,<br/>belong to this family of the myrtaceae, which contains forty-six<br/>genera and thirteen hundred species!"<br/>
