<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>18<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>At break of day the colonists regained in silence the entrance<br/>of the cavern, to which they gave the name of "Dakkar Grotto," in<br/>memory of Captain Nemo. It was now low-water, and they passed<br/>without difficulty under the arcade, washed on the right by the<br/>sea.<br/><br/>The canoe was left here, carefully protected from the waves. As<br/>additional precaution, Pencroft, Neb, and Ayrton drew it up on a<br/>little beach which bordered one of the sides of the grotto, in a<br/>spot where it could run no risk of harm.<br/><br/>The storm had ceased during the night. The last low mutterings<br/>of the thunder died away in the west. Rain fell no longer, but the<br/>sky was yet obscured by clouds. On the whole, this month of<br/>October, the first of the southern spring, was not ushered in by<br/>satisfactory tokens, and the wind had a tendency to shift from one<br/>point of the compass to another, which rendered it impossible to<br/>count upon settled weather.<br/><br/>Cyrus Harding and his companions, on leaving Dakkar Grotto, had<br/>taken the road to the corral. On their way Neb and Herbert were<br/>careful to preserve the wire which had been laid down by the<br/>captain between the corral and the grotto, and which might at a<br/>future time be of service.<br/><br/>The colonists spoke but little on the road. The various<br/>incidents of the night of October 15th had left a profound<br/>impression on their minds. The unknown being whose influence had so<br/>effectually protected them, the man whom their imagination had<br/>endowed with supernatural powers, Captain Nemo, was no more. His<br/>"Nautilus" and he were buried in the depths of the abyss. To each<br/>one of them their existence seemed even more isolated than before.<br/>They had been accustomed to count upon the intervention of that<br/>power which existed no longer, and Gideon Spilett, and even Cyrus<br/>Harding, could not escape this impression. Thus they maintained a<br/>profound silence during their journey to the corral.<br/><br/>Towards nine in the morning the colonists arrived at Granite<br/>House.<br/><br/>
