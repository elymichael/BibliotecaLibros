"Who but the hunter who fired the bullet?" replied the<br/>reporter.<br/><br/>"Well, if there is any one up there," replied Pencroft, who<br/>began to lose patience, "I will give them a hail, and they must<br/>answer."<br/><br/>And in a stentorian voice the sailor gave a prolonged "Halloo!"<br/>which was echoed again and again from the cliff and rocks.<br/><br/>The settlers listened and they thought they heard a sort of<br/>chuckling laugh, of which they could not guess the origin. But no<br/>voice replied to Pencroft, who in vain repeated his vigorous<br/>shouts.<br/><br/>There was something indeed in this to astonish the most<br/>apathetic of men, and the settlers were not men of that<br/>description. In their situation every incident had its importance,<br/>and, certainly, during the seven months which they had spent on the<br/>island, they had not before met with anything of so surprising a<br/>character.<br/><br/>Be that as it may, forgetting their fatigue in the singularity<br/>of the event, they remained below Granite House, not knowing what<br/>to think, not knowing what to do, questioning each other without<br/>any hope of a satisfactory reply, every one starting some<br/>supposition each more unlikely than the last. Neb bewailed himself,<br/>much disappointed at not being able to get into his kitchen, for<br/>the provisions which they had had on their expedition were<br/>exhausted, and they had no means of renewing them.<br/><br/>"My friends," at last said Cyrus Harding, "there is only one<br/>thing to be done at present; wait for day, and then act according<br/>to circumstances. But let us go to the Chimneys. There we shall be<br/>under shelter, and if we cannot eat, we can at least sleep."<br/><br/>"But who is it that has played us this cool trick?" again asked<br/>Pencroft, unable to make up his mind to retire from the spot.<br/><br/>Whoever it was, the only thing practicable was to do as the<br/>engineer proposed, to go to the Chimneys and there wait for day. In<br/>the meanwhile Top was ordered to mount guard below the windows of<br/>Granite House, and when Top received an order he obeyed it without<br/>any questioning. The brave dog therefore remained at the foot of<br/>the cliff while his master with his companions sought a refuge<br/>among the rocks.<br/><br/>To say that the settlers, notwithstanding their fatigue, slept<br/>well on the sandy floor of the Chimneys would not be true. It was<br/>not only that they were extremely anxious to find out the cause of<br/>what had happened, whether it was the result of an accident which<br/>would be discovered at the return of day, or whether on the<br/>contrary it was the work of a human being; but they also had very<br/>uncomfortable beds. That could not be helped, however, for in some<br/>way or other at that moment their dwelling was occupied, and they<br/>could not possibly enter it.<br/><br/>Now Granite House was more than their dwelling, it was their<br/>warehouse. There were all the stores belonging to the colony,<br/>weapons, instruments, tools, ammunition, provisions, etc. To think<br/>that all that might be pillaged and that the settlers would have<br/>all their work to do over again, fresh weapons and tools to make,<br/>was a serious matter. Their uneasiness led one or other of them<br/>also to go out every few minutes to see if Top was keeping good<br/>watch. Cyrus Harding alone waited with his habitual patience,<br/>although his strong mind was exasperated at being confronted with<br/>such an inexplicable fact, and he was provoked at himself for<br/>allowing a feeling to which he could not give a name, to gain an<br/>influence over him. Gideon Spilett shared his feelings in this<br/>respect, and the two conversed together in whispers of the<br/>inexplicable circumstance which baffled even their intelligence and<br/>experience.<br/>
