"What's the matter?" asked the reporter.

"Look," replied Neb, with a shout of laughter. And what did they
see? Master Jup smoking calmly and seriously, sitting crosslegged
like a Turk at the entrance to Granite House!

"My pipe," cried Pencroft. "He has taken my pipe! Hello, my
honest Jup, I make you a present of it! Smoke away, old boy, smoke
away!"

And Jup gravely puffed out clouds of smoke which seemed to give
him great satisfaction. Harding did not appear to be much
astonished at this incident, and he cited several examples of tame
apes, to whom the use of tobacco had become quite familiar.

But from this day Master Jup had a pipe of his own, the sailor's
ex-pipe, which was hung in his room near his store of tobacco. He
filled it himself, lighted it with a glowing coal, and appeared to
be the happiest of quadrumana. It may readily be understood that
this similarity of tastes of Jup and Pencroft served to tighten the
bonds of friendship which already existed between the honest ape
and the worthy sailor.

"Perhaps he is really a man," said Pencroft sometimes to Neb.
"Should you be surprised to hear him beginning to speak to us some
day?"

"My word, no," replied Neb. "What astonishes me is that he
hasn't spoken to us before, for now he wants nothing but
speech!"

"It would amuse me all the same," resumed the sailor, "if some
fine day he said to me, "Suppose we change pipes, Pencroft."

"Yes," replied Neb, "what a pity he was born dumb!"

With the month of September the winter ended, and the works were
again eagerly commenced. The building of the vessel advanced
rapidly, she was already completely decked over, and all the inside
parts of the hull were firmly united with ribs bent by means of
steam, which answered all the purposes of a mold.
