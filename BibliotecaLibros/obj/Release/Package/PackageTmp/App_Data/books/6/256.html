<br/>"Who knows?"<br/><br/>"And if you are caught in a hurricane?"<br/><br/>"There is no fear of that in the fine season," replied Pencroft.<br/>"But, captain, as we must provide against everything, I shall ask<br/>your permission to take Herbert only with me on this voyage."<br/><br/>"Pencroft," replied the engineer, placing his hand on the<br/>sailor's shoulder, "if any misfortune happens to you, or to this<br/>lad, whom chance has made our child, do you think we could ever<br/>cease to blame ourselves?"<br/><br/>"Captain Harding," replied Pencroft, with unshaken confidence,<br/>"we shall not cause you that sorrow. Besides, we will speak further<br/>of this voyage, when the time comes to make it. And I fancy, when<br/>you have seen our tight- rigged little craft, when you have<br/>observed how she behaves at sea, when we sail round our island, for<br/>we will do so togetherâ€”I fancy, I say, that you will no longer<br/>hesitate to let me go. I don't conceal from you that your boat will<br/>be a masterpiece."<br/><br/>"Say 'our' boat, at least, Pencroft," replied the engineer,<br/>disarmed for the moment. The conversation ended thus, to be resumed<br/>later on, without convincing either the sailor or the engineer.<br/><br/>The first snow fell towards the end of the month of June. The<br/>corral had previously been largely supplied with stores, so that<br/>daily visits to it were not requisite; but it was decided that more<br/>than a week should never be allowed to pass without someone going<br/>to it.<br/><br/>Traps were again set, and the machines manufactured by Harding<br/>were tried. The bent whalebones, imprisoned in a case of ice, and<br/>covered with a thick outer layer of fat, were placed on the border<br/>of the forest at a spot where animals usually passed on their way<br/>to the lake.<br/><br/>To the engineer's great satisfaction, this invention, copied<br/>from the Aleutian fishermen, succeeded perfectly. A dozen foxes, a<br/>few wild boars, and even a jaguar, were taken in this way, the<br/>animals being found dead, their stomachs pierced by the unbent<br/>bones.<br/><br/>An incident must here be related, not only as interesting in<br/>itself, but because it was the first attempt made by the colonists<br/>to communicate with the rest of mankind.<br/><br/>
