Under the trees, thanks to the thickness of their foliage, the<br/>obscurity rendered any object invisible beyond a radius of from<br/>thirty to forty feet. The reporter and Pencroft, halting at any<br/>suspicious sound, advanced with great caution.<br/><br/>They walked a little distance apart from each other so as to<br/>offer a less mark for a shot. And, to tell the truth, they expected<br/>every moment to hear a report. Five minutes after leaving the cart,<br/>Gideon Spilett and Pencroft arrived at the edge of the wood before<br/>the clearing beyond which rose the palisade.<br/><br/>They stopped. A few straggling beams still fell on the field<br/>clear of trees. Thirty feet distant was the gate of the corral,<br/>which appeared to be closed. This thirty feet, which it was<br/>necessary to cross from the wood to the palisade, constituted the<br/>dangerous zone, to borrow a ballistic term: in fact, one or more<br/>bullets fired from behind the palisade might knock over any one who<br/>ventured on to this zone. Gideon Spilett and the sailor were not<br/>men to draw back, but they knew that any imprudence on their part,<br/>of which they would be the first victims, would fall afterwards on<br/>their companions. If they themselves were killed, what would become<br/>of Harding, Neb, and Herbert?<br/><br/>But Pencroft, excited at feeling himself so near the corral<br/>where he supposed the convicts had taken refuge, was about to press<br/>forward, when the reporter held him back with a grasp of iron.<br/><br/>"In a few minutes it will be quite dark," whispered Spilett in<br/>the sailor's ear, "then will be the time to act."<br/><br/>Pencroft, convulsively clasping the butt-end of his gun,<br/>restrained his energies, and waited, swearing to himself.<br/><br/>Soon the last of the twilight faded away. Darkness, which seemed<br/>as if it issued from the dense forest, covered the clearing. Mount<br/>Franklin rose like an enormous screen before the western horizon,<br/>and night spread rapidly over all, as it does in regions of low<br/>latitudes. Now was the time.<br/><br/>The reporter and Pencroft, since posting themselves on the edge<br/>of the wood, had not once lost sight of the palisade. The corral<br/>appeared to be absolutely deserted. The top of the palisade formed<br/>a line, a little darker than the surrounding shadow, and nothing<br/>disturbed its distinctness. Nevertheless, if the convicts were<br/>there, they must have posted one of their number to guard against<br/>any surprise.<br/><br/>Spilett grasped his companion's hand, and both crept towards the<br/>corral, their guns ready to fire.<br/><br/>They reached the gate without the darkness being illuminated by<br/>a single ray of light.<br/><br/>Pencroft tried to push open the gate, which, as the reporter and<br/>he had supposed, was closed. However, the sailor was able to<br/>ascertain that the outer bars had not been put up. It might, then,<br/>be concluded that the convicts were there in the corral, and that<br/>very probably they had fastened the gate in such a way that it<br/>could not be forced open.<br/>
