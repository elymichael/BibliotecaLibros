"Provided it grows!" cried the sailor.

"It will grow," replied Cyrus Harding.

This was the 20th of June. The time was then propitious for
sowing this single precious grain of corn. It was first proposed to
plant it in a pot, but upon reflection it was decided to leave it
to nature, and confide it to the earth. This was done that very
day, and it is needless to add, that every precaution was taken
that the experiment might succeed.

The weather having cleared, the settlers climbed the height
above Granite House. There, on the plateau, they chose a spot, well
sheltered from the wind, and exposed to all the heat of the midday
sun. The place was cleared, carefully weeded, and searched for
insects and worms; then a bed of good earth, improved with a little
lime, was made; it was surrounded by a railing; and the grain was
buried in the damp earth.

Did it not seem as if the settlers were laying the first stone
of some edifice? It recalled to Pencroft the day on which he
lighted his only match, and all the anxiety of the operation. But
this time the thing was more serious. In fact, the castaways would
have been always able to procure fire, in some mode or other, but
no human power could supply another grain of corn, if unfortunately
this should be lost!
