"To oblige you, Neb, I will," replied the reporter; "but I warn<br/>you that if you disclose your receipts to me, I shall publish<br/>them."<br/><br/>"Whenever you like, Mr. Spilett," replied Neb; "whenever you<br/>like."<br/><br/>And so the next day Gideon Spilett became Neb's assistant and<br/>was installed in his culinary laboratory. The engineer had<br/>previously made known to him the result of the exploration which he<br/>had made the day before, and on this point the reporter shared<br/>Harding's opinion, that although he had found nothing, a secret<br/>still remained to be discovered!<br/><br/>The frost continued for another week, and the settlers did not<br/>leave Granite House unless to look after the poultry-yard. The<br/>dwelling was filled with appetizing odors, which were emitted from<br/>the learned manipulation of Neb and the reporter. But all the<br/>results of the chase were not made into preserved provisions; and<br/>as the game kept perfectly in the intense cold, wild duck and other<br/>fowl were eaten fresh, and declared superior to all other aquatic<br/>birds in the known world.<br/><br/>During this week, Pencroft, aided by Herbert, who handled the<br/>sailmaker's needle with much skill, worked with such energy that<br/>the sails of the vessel were finished. There was no want of<br/>cordage. Thanks to the rigging which had been discovered with the<br/>case of the balloon, the ropes and cables from the net were all of<br/>good quality, and the sailor turned them all to account. To the<br/>sails were attached strong bolt ropes, and there still remained<br/>enough from which to make the halyards, shrouds, and sheets, etc.<br/>The blocks were manufactured by Cyrus Harding under Pencroft's<br/>directions by means of the turning lathe. It therefore happened<br/>that the rigging was entirely prepared before the vessel was<br/>finished. Pencroft also manufactured a flag, that flag so dear to<br/>every true American, containing the stars and stripes of their<br/>glorious Union. The colors for it were supplied from certain plants<br/>used in dyeing, and which were very abundant in the island; only to<br/>the thirty-seven stars, representing the thirty- seven States of<br/>the Union, which shine on the American flag, the sailor added a<br/>thirty-eighth, the star of "the State of Lincoln," for he<br/>considered his island as already united to the great republic.<br/>"And," said he, "it is so already in heart, if not in deed!"<br/><br/>In the meantime, the flag was hoisted at the central window of<br/>Granite House, and the settlers saluted it with three cheers.<br/><br/>The cold season was now almost at an end, and it appeared as if<br/>this second winter was to pass without any unusual occurrence, when<br/>on the night of the 11th of August, the plateau of Prospect Heights<br/>was menaced with complete destruction.<br/><br/>After a busy day the colonists were sleeping soundly, when<br/>towards four o'clock in the morning they were suddenly awakened by<br/>Top's barking.<br/><br/>The dog was not this time barking near the mouth of the well,<br/>but at the threshold of the door, at which he was scratching as if<br/>he wished to burst it open. Jup was also uttering piercing<br/>cries.<br/><br/>"Hello, Top!" cried Neb, who was the first awake. But the dog<br/>continued to bark more furiously than ever.<br/><br/>"What's the matter now?" asked Harding.<br/>
