"Why, captain?" asked Herbert.<br/><br/>"Because the sea, my boy, may be considered as an immense<br/>reservoir, in which is stored the heat of the summer. When winter<br/>comes, it restores this heat, which insures for the regions near<br/>the ocean a medium temperature, less high in summer, but less low<br/>in winter."<br/><br/>"We shall prove that," replied Pencroft. "But I don't want to<br/>bother myself about whether it will be cold or not. One thing is<br/>certain, that is that the days are already short, and the evenings<br/>long. Suppose we talk about the question of light."<br/><br/>"Nothing is easier," replied Harding.<br/><br/>"To talk about?" asked the sailor.<br/><br/>"To settle."<br/><br/>"And when shall we begin?"<br/><br/>"To-morrow, by having a seal hunt."<br/><br/>"To make candles?"<br/><br/>"Yes."<br/><br/>Such was the engineer's project; and it was quite feasible,<br/>since he had lime and sulphuric acid, while the amphibians of the<br/>islet would furnish the fat necessary for the manufacture.<br/>
