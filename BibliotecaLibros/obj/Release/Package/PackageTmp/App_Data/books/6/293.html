<br/>"About what age is he?" asked the lad.<br/><br/>"It is difficult to say," replied the reporter, "for it is<br/>impossible to see his features under the thick beard which covers<br/>his face, but he is no longer young, and I suppose he might be<br/>about fifty."<br/><br/>"Have you noticed, Mr. Spilett, how deeply sunk his eyes are?"<br/>asked Herbert.<br/><br/>"Yes, Herbert, but I must add that they are more human than one<br/>could expect from his appearance."<br/><br/>"However, we shall see," replied Pencroft, "and I am anxious to<br/>know what opinion Captain Harding will have of our savage. We went<br/>to look for a human creature, and we are bringing back a monster!<br/>After all, we did what we could."<br/><br/>The night passed, and whether the prisoner slept or not could<br/>not be known, but at any rate, although he had been unbound, he did<br/>not move. He was like a wild animal, which appears stunned at first<br/>by its capture, and becomes wild again afterwards.<br/><br/>At daybreak the next morning, the 15th of October, the change of<br/>weather predicted by Pencroft occurred. The wind having shifted to<br/>the northwest favored the return of the "Bonadventure," but at the<br/>same time it freshened, which might render navigation more<br/>difficult.<br/><br/>At five o'clock in the morning the anchor was weighed. Pencroft<br/>took a reef in the mainsail, and steered towards the north-east, so<br/>as to sail straight for Lincoln Island.<br/><br/>The first day of the voyage was not marked by any incident. The<br/>prisoner remained quiet in the fore-cabin, and as he had been a<br/>sailor it appeared that the motion of the vessel might produce on<br/>him a salutary reaction. Did some recollection of his former<br/>calling return to him? However that might be, he remained tranquil,<br/>astonished rather than depressed.<br/><br/>The next day the wind increased, blowing more from the north,<br/>consequently in a less favorable direction for the "Bonadventure."<br/>Pencroft was soon obliged to sail close-hauled, and without saying<br/>anything about it he began to be uneasy at the state of the sea,<br/>which frequently broke over the bows. Certainly, if the wind did<br/>not moderate, it would take a longer time to reach Lincoln Island<br/>than it had taken to make Tabor Island.<br/><br/>
