At break of day the colonists regained in silence the entrance
of the cavern, to which they gave the name of "Dakkar Grotto," in
memory of Captain Nemo. It was now low-water, and they passed
without difficulty under the arcade, washed on the right by the
sea.

The canoe was left here, carefully protected from the waves. As
additional precaution, Pencroft, Neb, and Ayrton drew it up on a
little beach which bordered one of the sides of the grotto, in a
spot where it could run no risk of harm.

The storm had ceased during the night. The last low mutterings
of the thunder died away in the west. Rain fell no longer, but the
sky was yet obscured by clouds. On the whole, this month of
October, the first of the southern spring, was not ushered in by
satisfactory tokens, and the wind had a tendency to shift from one
point of the compass to another, which rendered it impossible to
count upon settled weather.

Cyrus Harding and his companions, on leaving Dakkar Grotto, had
taken the road to the corral. On their way Neb and Herbert were
careful to preserve the wire which had been laid down by the
captain between the corral and the grotto, and which might at a
future time be of service.

The colonists spoke but little on the road. The various
incidents of the night of October 15th had left a profound
impression on their minds. The unknown being whose influence had so
effectually protected them, the man whom their imagination had
endowed with supernatural powers, Captain Nemo, was no more. His
"Nautilus" and he were buried in the depths of the abyss. To each
one of them their existence seemed even more isolated than before.
They had been accustomed to count upon the intervention of that
power which existed no longer, and Gideon Spilett, and even Cyrus
Harding, could not escape this impression. Thus they maintained a
profound silence during their journey to the corral.

Towards nine in the morning the colonists arrived at Granite
House.
