<br/>"It is a malignant fever," said he.<br/><br/>"A malignant fever!" cried Harding. "You are mistaken, Spilett.<br/>A malignant fever does not declare itself spontaneously; its germ<br/>must previously have existed."<br/><br/>"I am not mistaken," replied the reporter. "Herbert no doubt<br/>contracted the germ of this fever in the marshes of the island.
