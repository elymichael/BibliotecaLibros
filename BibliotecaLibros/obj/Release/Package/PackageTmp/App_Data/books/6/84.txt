"There is only the point at the southeastern extremity of the
island to be named," said Pencroft.

"That is, the extremity of Union Bay?" asked Herbert.

"Claw Cape," cried Neb directly, who also wished to be godfather
to some part of his domain.

In truth, Neb had found an excellent name, for this cape was
very like the powerful claw of the fantastic animal which this
singularly-shaped island represented.

Pencroft was delighted at the turn things had taken, and their
imaginations soon gave to the river which furnished the settlers
with drinking water and near which the balloon had thrown them, the
name of the Mercy, in true gratitude to Providence. To the islet
upon which the castaways had first landed, the name of Safety
Island; to the plateau which crowned the high granite precipice
above the Chimneys, and from whence the gaze could embrace the
whole of the vast bay, the name of Prospect Heights.

Lastly, all the masses of impenetrable wood which covered the
Serpentine Peninsula were named the forests of the Far West.

The nomenclature of the visible and known parts of the island
was thus finished, and later, they would complete it as they made
fresh discoveries.

As to the points of the compass, the engineer had roughly fixed
them by the height and position of the sun, which placed Union Bay
and Prospect Heights to the east. But the next day, by taking the
exact hour of the rising and setting of the sun, and by marking its
position between this rising and setting, he reckoned to fix the
north of the island exactly, for, in consequence of its situation
in the Southern Hemisphere, the sun, at the precise moment of its
culmination, passed in the north and not in the south, as, in its
apparent movement, it seems to do, to those places situated in the
Northern Hemisphere.

Everything was finished, and the settlers had only to descend
Mount Franklin to return to the Chimneys, when Pencroft cried
out,â€”

"Well! we are preciously stupid!"

"Why?" asked Gideon Spilett, who had closed his notebook and
risen to depart.
