<br/>Was this barren spot the desolate refuge of sea-birds, strewn<br/>with stones and destitute of vegetation, attached to a more<br/>important archipelago? It was impossible to say. When the voyagers<br/>from their car saw the land through the mist, they had not been<br/>able to reconnoiter it sufficiently. However, Pencroft, accustomed<br/>with his sailor eyes to piece through the gloom, was almost certain<br/>that he could clearly distinguish in the west confused masses which<br/>indicated an elevated coast. But they could not in the dark<br/>determine whether it was a single island, or connected with others.<br/>They could not leave it either, as the sea surrounded them; they<br/>must therefore put off till the next day their search for the<br/>engineer, from whom, alas! not a single cry had reached them to<br/>show that he was still in existence.<br/><br/>"The silence of our friend proves nothing," said the reporter.<br/>"Perhaps he has fainted or is wounded, and unable to reply<br/>directly, so we will not despair."<br/><br/>The reporter then proposed to light a fire on a point of the<br/>islet, which would serve as a signal to the engineer. But they<br/>searched in vain for wood or dry brambles; nothing but sand and<br/>stones were to be found. The grief of Neb and his companions, who<br/>were all strongly attached to the intrepid Harding, can be better<br/>pictured than described. It was too evident that they were<br/>powerless to help him. They must wait with what patience they could<br/>for daylight. Either the engineer had been able to save himself,<br/>and had already found a refuge on some point of the coast, or he<br/>was lost for ever! The long and painful hours passed by. The cold<br/>was intense. The castaways suffered cruelly, but they scarcely<br/>perceived it. They did not even think of taking a minute's rest.<br/>Forgetting everything but their chief, hoping or wishing to hope<br/>on, they continued to walk up and down on this sterile spot, always<br/>returning to its northern point, where they could approach nearest<br/>to the scene of the catastrophe. They listened, they called, and<br/>then uniting their voices, they endeavored to raise even a louder<br/>shout than before, which would be transmitted to a great distance.<br/>The wind had now fallen almost to a calm, and the noise of the sea<br/>began also to subside. One of Neb's shouts even appeared to produce<br/>an echo. Herbert directed Pencroft's attention to it, adding, "That<br/>proves that there is a coast to the west, at no great distance."<br/>The sailor nodded; besides, his eyes could not deceive him. If he<br/>had discovered land, however indistinct it might appear, land was<br/>sure to be there. But that distant echo was the only response<br/>produced by Neb's shouts, while a heavy gloom hung over all the<br/>part east of the island.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the sky was clearing little by little. Towards<br/>midnight the stars shone out, and if the engineer had been there<br/>with his companions he would have remarked that these stars did not<br/>belong to the Northern Hemisphere. The Polar Star was not visible,<br/>the constellations were not those which they had been accustomed to<br/>see in the United States; the Southern Cross glittered brightly in<br/>the sky.<br/><br/>The night passed away. Towards five o'clock in the morning of<br/>the 25th of March, the sky began to lighten; the horizon still<br/>remained dark, but with daybreak a thick mist rose from the sea, so<br/>that the eye could scarcely penetrate beyond twenty feet or so from<br/>where they stood. At length the fog gradually unrolled itself in<br/>great heavily moving waves.<br/><br/>It was unfortunate, however, that the castaways could<br/>distinguish nothing around them. While the gaze of the reporter and<br/>Neb were cast upon the ocean, the sailor and Herbert looked eagerly<br/>for the coast in the west. But not a speck of land was visible.<br/>"Never mind," said Pencroft, "though I do not see the land, I feel<br/>it… it is there… there… as sure as the fact that we are no longer<br/>at Richmond." But the fog was not long in rising. it was only a<br/>fine-weather mist. A hot sun soon penetrated to the surface of the<br/>island. About half-past six, three-quarters of an hour after<br/>sunrise, the mist became more transparent. It grew thicker above,<br/>but cleared away below. Soon the isle appeared as if it had<br/>descended from a cloud, then the sea showed itself around them,<br/>spreading far away towards the east, but bounded on the west by an<br/>abrupt and precipitous coast.<br/><br/>Yes! the land was there. Their safety was at least provisionally<br/>insured. The islet and the coast were separated by a channel about<br/>half a mile in breadth, through which rushed an extremely rapid<br/>current.<br/><br/>However, one of the castaways, following the impulse of his<br/>heart, immediately threw himself into the current, without<br/>consulting his companions, without saying a single word. It was<br/>Neb. He was in haste to be on the other side, and to climb towards<br/>the north. It had been impossible to hold him back. Pencroft called<br/>him in vain. The reporter prepared to follow him, but Pencroft<br/>stopped him. "Do you want to cross the channel?" he asked. "Yes,"<br/>replied Spilett. "All right!" said the seaman; "wait a bit; Neb is<br/>well able to carry help to his master. If we venture into the<br/>channel, we risk being carried into the open sea by the current,<br/>which is running very strong; but, if I'm not wrong, it is ebbing.<br/>See, the tide is going down over the sand. Let us have patience,<br/>and at low water it is possible we may find a fordable passage."<br/>"You are right," replied the reporter, "we will not separate more<br/>than we can help."<br/><br/>During this time Neb was struggling vigorously against the<br/>current. He was crossing in an oblique direction. His black<br/>shoulders could be seen emerging at each stroke. He was carried<br/>down very quickly, but he also made way towards the shore. It took<br/>more than half an hour to cross from the islet to the land, and he<br/>reached the shore several hundred feet from the place which was<br/>opposite to the point from which he had started.<br/><br/>Landing at the foot of a high wall of granite, he shook himself<br/>vigorously; and then, setting off running, soon disappeared behind<br/>a rocky point, which projected to nearly the height of the northern<br/>extremity of the islet.<br/><br/>
