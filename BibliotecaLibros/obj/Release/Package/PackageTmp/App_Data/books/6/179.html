"But your boat leaks rather, Pencroft."<br/><br/>"That's nothing, Neb," replied the sailor; "the wood will get<br/>seasoned. In two days there won't be a single leak, and our boat<br/>will have no more water in her than there is in the stomach of a<br/>drunkard. Jump in!"<br/><br/>They were soon all seated, and Pencroft shoved off. The weather<br/>was magnificent, the sea as calm as if its waters were contained<br/>within the narrow limits of a lake. Thus the boat could proceed<br/>with as much security as if it was ascending the tranquil current<br/>of the Mercy.<br/><br/>Neb took one of the oars, Herbert the other, and Pencroft<br/>remained in the stern in order to use the scull.<br/><br/>The sailor first crossed the channel, and steered close to the<br/>southern point of the islet. A light breeze blew from the south. No<br/>roughness was found either in the channel or the green sea. A long<br/>swell, which the canoe scarcely felt, as it was heavily laden,<br/>rolled regularly over the surface of the water. They pulled out<br/>about half a mile distant from the shore, that they might have a<br/>good view of Mount Franklin.<br/><br/>Pencroft afterwards returned towards the mouth of the river. The<br/>boat then skirted the shore, which, extending to the extreme point,<br/>hid all Tadorn's Fens.<br/><br/>This point, of which the distance was increased by the<br/>irregularity of the coast, was nearly three miles from the Mercy.<br/>The settlers resolved to go to its extremity, and only go beyond it<br/>as much as was necessary to take a rapid survey of the coast as far<br/>as Claw Cape.<br/><br/>The canoe followed the windings of the shore, avoiding the rocks<br/>which fringed it, and which the rising tide began to cover. The<br/>cliff gradually sloped away from the mouth of the river to the<br/>point. This was formed of granite reeks, capriciously distributed,<br/>very different from the cliff at Prospect Heights, and of an<br/>extremely wild aspect. It might have been said that an immense<br/>cartload of rocks had been emptied out there. There was no<br/>vegetation on this sharp promontory, which projected two miles from<br/>the forest, and it thus represented a giant's arm stretched out<br/>from a leafy sleeve.<br/><br/>The canoe, impelled by the two oars, advanced without<br/>difficulty. Gideon Spilett, pencil in one hand and notebook in the<br/>other, sketched the coast in bold strokes. Neb, Herbert, and<br/>Pencroft chatted, while examining this part of their domain, which<br/>was new to them, and, in proportion as the canoe proceeded towards<br/>the south, the two Mandible Capes appeared to move, and surround<br/>Union Bay more closely.<br/><br/>As to Cyrus Harding, he did not speak; he simply gazed, and by<br/>the mistrust which his look expressed, it appeared that he was<br/>examining some strange country.<br/><br/>In the meantime, after a voyage of three-quarters of an hour,<br/>the canoe reached the extremity of the point, and Pencroft was<br/>preparing to return, when Herbert, rising, pointed to a black<br/>object, saying,â€”<br/>
