<br/>"Upon my word," answered Herbert, "it is rather difficult to say<br/>how it happened. I was, I think, occupied in collecting my plants,<br/>when I heard a noise like an avalanche falling from a very tall<br/>tree. I scarcely had time to look round. This unfortunate man, who<br/>was without doubt concealed in a tree, rushed upon me in less time<br/>than I take to tell you about it, and unless Mr. Spilett and<br/>Pencroft—"<br/><br/>"My boy!" said Cyrus Harding, "you ran a great danger, but,<br/>perhaps, without that, the poor creature would have still hidden<br/>himself from your search, and we should not have had a new<br/>companion."<br/><br/>"You hope, then, Cyrus, to succeed in reforming the man?" asked<br/>the reporter.<br/><br/>"Yes," replied the engineer.<br/><br/>Breakfast over, Harding and his companions left Granite House<br/>and returned to the beach.

It was agreed to establish a small<br/>powder- magazine, either outside Granite House or in the Upper<br/>Cavern, where there would be no fear of explosion. However, the use<br/>of pyroxyle was to be continued, for this substance giving<br/>excellent results, there was no reason for substituting ordinary<br/>powder.<br/><br/>When the unloading of the vessel was finished,—<br/><br/>"Captain," said Pencroft, "I think it would be prudent to put<br/>our 'Bonadventure' in a safe place."<br/><br/>"Is she not safe at the mouth of the Mercy?" asked Cyrus<br/>Harding.<br/><br/>
