The engineer's thought was at once understood. it might be<br/>possible to dam, as it were, the torrent, and thus compel it to<br/>pour itself into the lake.<br/><br/>The colonists hastened to the dockyard. They returned with<br/>shovels, picks, axes, and by means of banking the earth with the<br/>aid of fallen trees they succeeded in a few hours in raising an<br/>embankment three feet high and some hundreds of paces in length. It<br/>seemed to them, when they had finished, as if they had scarcely<br/>been working more than a few minutes.<br/><br/>It was not a moment too soon. The liquefied substances soon<br/>after reached the bottom of the barrier. The stream of lava swelled<br/>like a river about to overflow its banks, and threatened to<br/>demolish the sole obstacle which could prevent it from overrunning<br/>the whole Far West. But the dam held firm, and after a moment of<br/>terrible suspense the torrent precipitated itself into Grant Lake<br/>from a height of twenty feet.<br/><br/>The colonists, without moving or uttering a word, breathlessly<br/>regarded this strife of the two elements.<br/><br/>What a spectacle was this conflict between water and fire! What<br/>pen could describe the marvelous horror of this sceneâ€”what pencil<br/>could depict it? The water hissed as it evaporated by contact with<br/>the boiling lava. The vapor whirled in the air to an immeasurable<br/>height, as if the valves of an immense boiler had been suddenly<br/>opened. But, however considerable might be the volume of water<br/>contained in the lake, it must eventually be absorbed, because it<br/>was not replenished, while the stream of lava, fed from an<br/>inexhaustible source, rolled on without ceasing new waves of<br/>incandescent matter.<br/><br/>The first waves of lava which fell in the lake immediately<br/>solidified and accumulated so as speedily to emerge from it. Upon<br/>their surface fell other waves, which in their turn became stone,<br/>but a step nearer the center of the lake. In this manner was formed<br/>a pier which threatened to gradually fill up the lake, which could<br/>not overflow, the water displaced by the lava being evaporated. The<br/>hissing of the water rent the air with a deafening sound, and the<br/>vapor, blown by the wind, fell in rain upon the sea. The pier<br/>became longer and longer, and the blocks of lava piled themselves<br/>one on another. Where formerly stretched the calm waters of the<br/>lake now appeared an enormous mass of smoking rocks, as if an<br/>upheaving of the soil had formed immense shoals. Imagine the waters<br/>of the lake aroused by a hurricane, then suddenly solidified by an<br/>intense frost, and some conception may be formed of the aspect of<br/>the lake three hours alter the eruption of this irresistible<br/>torrent of lava.<br/><br/>This time water would be vanquished by fire.<br/><br/>Nevertheless it was a fortunate circumstance for the colonists<br/>that the effusion of lava should have been in the direction of Lake<br/>Grant. They had before them some days' respite. The plateau of<br/>Prospect Heights, Granite House, and the dockyard were for the<br/>moment preserved. And these few days it was necessary to employ in<br/>planking and carefully calking the vessel, and launching her. The<br/>colonists would then take refuge on board the vessel, content to<br/>rig her after she should be afloat on the waters. With the danger<br/>of an explosion which threatened to destroy the island there could<br/>be no security on shore. The walls of Granite House, once so sure a<br/>retreat, might at any moment fall in upon them.<br/><br/>During the six following days, from the 25th to the 30th of<br/>January, the colonists accomplished as much of the construction of<br/>their vessel as twenty men could have done. They hardly allowed<br/>themselves a moment's repose, and the glare of the flames which<br/>shot from the crater enabled them to work night and day. The flow<br/>of lava continued, but perhaps less abundantly. This was fortunate,<br/>for Lake Grant was almost entirely choked up, and if more lava<br/>should accumulate it would inevitably spread over the plateau of<br/>Prospect Heights, and thence upon the beach.<br/><br/>But if the island was thus partially protected on this side, it<br/>was not so with the western part.<br/><br/>In fact, the second stream of lava, which had followed the<br/>valley of Falls River, a valley of great extent, the land on both<br/>sides of the creek being flat, met with no obstacle. The burning<br/>liquid had then spread through the forest of the Far West. At this<br/>period of the year, when the trees were dried up by a tropical<br/>heat, the forest caught fire instantaneously, in such a manner that<br/>the conflagration extended itself both by the trunks of the trees<br/>and by their higher branches, whose interlacement favored its<br/>progress. It even appeared that the current of flame spread more<br/>rapidly among the summits of the trees than the current of lava at<br/>their bases.<br/>
