Was it remorse that overwhelmed him thus? They were compelled to
believe so, and Gideon Spilett could not help one day making this
observation,—

"If he does not speak it is because he has, I fear, things too
serious to be told!"

They must be patient and wait.

A few days later, on the 3rd of November, the stranger, working
on the plateau, had stopped, letting his spade drop to the ground,
and Harding, who was observing him from a little distance, saw that
tears were again flowing from his eyes. A sort of irresistible pity
led him towards the unfortunate man, and he touched his arm
lightly.

"My friend!" said he.

The stranger tried to avoid his look, and Cyrus Harding having
endeavored to take his hand, he drew back quickly.

"My friend," said Harding in a firmer voice, "look at me, I wish
it!"

The stranger looked at the engineer, and seemed to be under his
power, as a subject under the influence of a mesmerist. He wished
to run away. But then his countenance suddenly underwent a
transformation. His eyes flashed. Words struggled to escape from
his lips. He could no longer contain himself! At last he folded his
arms; then, in a hollow voice,—"Who are you?" he asked Cyrus
Harding.

"Castaways, like you," replied the engineer, whose emotion was
deep. "We have brought you here, among your fellow-men."

"My fellow-men!… . I have none!"

"You are in the midst of friends."
