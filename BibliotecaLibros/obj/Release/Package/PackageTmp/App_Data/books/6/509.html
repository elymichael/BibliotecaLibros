<br/>"And we can't put it out!" replied Herbert.<br/><br/>"The volcano ought to be swept," observed Neb, who spoke as if<br/>perfectly serious.<br/><br/>"Well said, Neb!" cried Pencroft, with a shout of laughter; "and<br/>you'll undertake the job, no doubt?"<br/><br/>Cyrus Harding attentively observed the dense smoke emitted by<br/>Mount Franklin, and even listened, as if expecting to hear some<br/>distant muttering. Then, turning towards his companions, from whom<br/>he had gone somewhat apart, he said,—<br/><br/>"The truth is, my friends, we must not conceal from ourselves<br/>that an important change is going forward. The volcanic substances<br/>are no longer in a state of ebullition, they have caught fire, and<br/>we are undoubtedly menaced by an approaching eruption."<br/><br/>"Well, captain," said Pencroft, "we shall witness the eruption;<br/>and if it is a good one, we'll applaud it. I don't see that we need<br/>concern ourselves further about the matter."<br/><br/>"It may be so," replied Cyrus Harding, "for the ancient track of<br/>the lava is still open; and thanks to this, the crater has hitherto<br/>overflowed towards the north. And yet—"<br/><br/>"And yet, as we can derive no advantage from an eruption, it<br/>might be better it should not take place," said the reporter.<br/><br/>"Who knows?" answered the sailor. "Perhaps there may be some<br/>valuable substance in this volcano, which it will spout forth, and<br/>which we may turn to good account!"<br/><br/>Cyrus Harding shook his head with the air of a man who augured<br/>no good from the phenomenon whose development had been so sudden.<br/>He did not regard so lightly as Pencroft the results of an<br/>eruption. If the lava, in consequence of the position of the<br/>crater, did not directly menace the wooded and cultivated parts of<br/>the island, other complications might present themselves. In fact,<br/>eruptions are not unfrequently accompanied by earthquakes; and an<br/>island of the nature of Lincoln Island, formed of substances so<br/>varied, basalt on one side, granite on the other, lava on the<br/>north, rich soil on the south, substances which consequently could<br/>not be firmly attached to each other, would be exposed to the risk<br/>of disintegration. Although, therefore, the spreading of the<br/>volcanic matter might not constitute a serious danger, any movement<br/>of the terrestrial structure which should shake the island might<br/>entail the gravest consequences.<br/><br/>
