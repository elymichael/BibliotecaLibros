The interior of the crater, whose inclination did not exceed<br/>thirty five to forty degrees, presented no difficulties nor<br/>obstacles to the ascent. Traces of very ancient lava were noticed,<br/>which probably had overflowed the summit of the cone, before this<br/>lateral chasm had opened a new way to it.<br/><br/>As to the volcanic chimney which established a communication<br/>between the subterranean layers and the crater, its depth could not<br/>be calculated with the eye, for it was lost in obscurity. But there<br/>was no doubt as to the complete extinction of the volcano.<br/><br/>Before eight o'clock Harding and his companions were assembled<br/>at the summit of the crater, on a conical mound which swelled the<br/>northern edge.<br/><br/>"The sea, the sea everywhere!" they cried, as if their lips<br/>could not restrain the words which made islanders of them.<br/><br/>The sea, indeed, formed an immense circular sheet of water all<br/>around them! Perhaps, on climbing again to the summit of the cone,<br/>Cyrus Harding had had a hope of discovering some coast, some island<br/>shore, which he had not been able to perceive in the dark the<br/>evening before. But nothing appeared on the farthest verge of the<br/>horizon, that is to say over a radius of more than fifty miles. No<br/>land in sight. Not a sail. Over all this immense space the ocean<br/>alone was visible—the island occupied the center of a circumference<br/>which appeared to be infinite.<br/><br/>The engineer and his companions, mute and motionless, surveyed<br/>for some minutes every point of the ocean, examining it to its most<br/>extreme limits. Even Pencroft, who possessed a marvelous power of<br/>sight, saw nothing; and certainly if there had been land at the<br/>horizon, if it appeared only as an indistinct vapor, the sailor<br/>would undoubtedly have found it out, for nature had placed regular<br/>telescopes under his eyebrows.<br/><br/>From the ocean their gaze returned to the island which they<br/>commanded entirely, and the first question was put by Gideon<br/>Spilett in these terms:<br/><br/>"About what size is this island?"<br/><br/>Truly, it did not appear large in the midst of the immense<br/>ocean.<br/><br/>Cyrus Harding reflected a few minutes; he attentively observed<br/>the perimeter of the island, taking into consideration the height<br/>at which he was placed; then,—<br/><br/>"My friends," said he, "I do not think I am mistaken in giving<br/>to the shore of the island a circumference of more than a hundred<br/>miles."<br/>
