The settlers now began to talk of fetching the balloon-case,<br/>which they were anxious to place in perfect security; but to bring<br/>it, it would be necessary to take a cart to Port Balloon, and<br/>consequently, necessary to beat a road through the dense forests of<br/>the Far West. This would take some time. Also, Neb and Pencroft<br/>having gone to examine into the state of things at Port Balloon,<br/>and reported that the stock of cloth would suffer no damage in the<br/>grotto where it was stored, it was decided that the work at<br/>Prospect Heights should not be discontinued.<br/><br/>"That," observed Pencroft, "will enable us to establish our<br/>poultry-yard under better conditions, since we need have no fear of<br/>visits from foxes nor the attacks of other beasts."<br/><br/>"Then," added Neb, "we can clear the plateau, and transplant<br/>wild plants to it."<br/><br/>"And prepare our second corn-field!" cried the sailor with a<br/>triumphant air.<br/><br/>In fact, the first corn-field sown with a single grain had<br/>prospered admirably, thanks to Pencroft's care. It had produced the<br/>ten ears foretold by the engineer, and each ear containing eighty<br/>grains, the colony found itself in possession of eight hundred<br/>grains, in six months, which promised a double harvest each<br/>year.<br/><br/>These eight hundred grains, except fifty, which were prudently<br/>reserved, were to be sown in a new field, but with no less care<br/>than was bestowed on the single grain.<br/><br/>The field was prepared, then surrounded with a strong palisade,<br/>high and pointed, which quadrupeds would have found difficulty in<br/>leaping. As to birds, some scarecrows, due to Pencroft's ingenious<br/>brain, were enough to frighten them. The seven hundred and fifty<br/>grains deposited in very regular furrows were then left for nature<br/>to do the rest.<br/><br/>On the 21st of November, Cyrus Harding began to plan the canal<br/>which was to close the plateau on the west, from the south angle of<br/>Lake Grant to the angle of the Mercy. There was there two or three<br/>feet of vegetable earth, and below that granite. It was therefore<br/>necessary to manufacture some more nitro-glycerine, and the<br/>nitro-glycerine did its accustomed work. In less than a fortnight a<br/>ditch, twelve feet wide and six deep, was dug out in the hard<br/>ground of the plateau. A new trench was made by the same means in<br/>the rocky border of the lake, forming a small stream, to which they<br/>gave the name of Creek Glycerine, and which was thus an affluent of<br/>the Mercy. As the engineer had predicted, the level of the lake was<br/>lowered, though very slightly. To complete the enclosure the bed of<br/>the stream on the beach was considerably enlarged, and the sand<br/>supported by means of stakes.<br/><br/>By the end of the first fortnight of December these works were<br/>finished, and Prospect Heights—that is to say, a sort of irregular<br/>pentagon, having a perimeter of nearly four miles, surrounded by a<br/>liquid belt—was completely protected from depredators of every<br/>description.<br/><br/>During the month of December, the heat was very great. In spite<br/>of it, however, the settlers continued their work, and as they were<br/>anxious to possess a poultry-yard they forthwith commenced it.<br/><br/>It is useless to say that since the enclosing of the plateau had<br/>been completed, Master Jup had been set at liberty. He did not<br/>leave his masters, and evinced no wish to escape. He was a gentle<br/>animal, though very powerful and wonderfully active. He was already<br/>taught to make himself useful by drawing loads of wood and carting<br/>away the stones which were extracted from the bed of Creek<br/>Glycerine.<br/>
