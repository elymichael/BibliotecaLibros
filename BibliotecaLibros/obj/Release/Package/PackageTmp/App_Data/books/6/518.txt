The next day, the 8th day of January, after a day and night
passed at the corral, where they left all in order, Cyrus Harding
and Ayrton arrived at Granite House.

The engineer immediately called his companions together, and
informed them of the imminent danger which threatened Lincoln
Island, and from which no human power could deliver them.

"My friends," he said, and his voice betrayed the depth of his
emotion, "our island is not among those which will endure while
this earth endures. It is doomed to more or less speedy
destruction, the cause of which it bears within itself, and from
which nothing can save it."

The colonists looked at each other, then at the engineer. They
did not clearly comprehend him.

"Explain yourself, Cyrus!" said Gideon Spilett.

"I will do so," replied Cyrus Harding, "or rather I will simply
afford you the explanation which, during our few minutes of private
conversation, was given me by Captain Nemo."
