"No," replied Harding, "it is wormwood; Chinese wormwood to the<br/>learned, but to us it will be tinder."<br/><br/>When the wormwood was properly dried it provided them with a<br/>very inflammable substance, especially afterwards when the engineer<br/>had impregnated it with nitrate of potash, of which the island<br/>possessed several beds, and which is in truth saltpeter.<br/><br/>The colonists had a good supper that evening. Neb prepared some<br/>agouti soup, a smoked capybara ham, to which was added the boiled<br/>tubercules of the "caladium macrorhizum," an herbaceous plant of<br/>the arum family. They had an excellent taste, and were very<br/>nutritious, being something similar to the substance which is sold<br/>in England under the name of "Portland sago"; they were also a good<br/>substitute for bread, which the settlers in Lincoln Island did not<br/>yet possess.<br/><br/>When supper was finished, before sleeping, Harding and his<br/>companions went to take the air on the beach. it was eight o'clock<br/>in the evening; the night was magnificent. The moon, which had been<br/>full five days before, had not yet risen, but the horizon was<br/>already silvered by those soft, pale shades which might be called<br/>the dawn of the moon. At the southern zenith glittered the<br/>circumpolar constellations, and above all the Southern Cross, which<br/>some days before the engineer had greeted on the summit of Mount<br/>Franklin.<br/><br/>Cyrus Harding gazed for some time at this splendid<br/>constellation, which has at its summit and at its base two stars of<br/>the first magnitude, at its left arm a star of the second, and at<br/>its right arm a star of the third magnitude.<br/><br/>Then, after some minutes thoughtâ€”<br/><br/>"Herbert," he asked of the lad, "is not this the 15th of<br/>April?"<br/><br/>"Yes, captain," replied Herbert.<br/><br/>"Well, if I am not mistaken, to-morrow will be one of the four<br/>days in the year in which the real time is identical with average<br/>time; that is to say, my boy, that to-morrow, to within some<br/>seconds, the sun will pass the meridian just at midday by the<br/>clocks. If the weather is fine I think that I shall obtain the<br/>longitude of the island with an approximation of some degrees."<br/><br/>"Without instruments, without sextant?" asked Gideon<br/>Spilett.<br/><br/>"Yes," replied the engineer. "Also, since the night is clear, I<br/>will try, this very evening, to obtain our latitude by calculating<br/>the height of the Southern Cross, that is, from the southern pole<br/>above the horizon. You understand, my friends, that before<br/>undertaking the work of installation in earnest it is not enough to<br/>have found out that this land is an island; we must, as nearly as<br/>possible, know at what distance it is situated, either from the<br/>American continent or Australia, or from the principal<br/>archipelagoes of the Pacific."<br/>
