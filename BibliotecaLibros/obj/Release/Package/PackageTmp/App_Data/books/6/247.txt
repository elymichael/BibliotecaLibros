On the 30th of April, the two sportsmen were in the depth of the
Far West, when the reporter, preceding Herbert a few paces, arrived
in a sort of clearing, into which the trees more sparsely scattered
had permitted a few rays to penetrate. Gideon Spilett was at first
surprised at the odor which exhaled from certain plants with
straight stalks, round and branchy, bearing grape-like clusters of
flowers and very small berries. The reporter broke off one or two
of these stalks and returned to the lad, to whom he said,â€”

"What can this be, Herbert?"

"Well, Mr. Spilett," said Herbert, "this is a treasure which
will secure you Pencroft's gratitude forever."

"Is it tobacco?"

"Yes, and though it may not be of the first quality, it is none
the less tobacco!"

"Oh, good old Pencroft! Won't he be pleased! But we must not let
him smoke it all, he must give us our share."

"Ah! an idea occurs to me, Mr, Spilett," replied Herbert. "Don't
let us say anything to Pencroft yet; we will prepare these leaves,
and one fine day we will present him with a pipe already
filled!"

"All right, Herbert, and on that day our worthy companion will
have nothing left to wish for in this world."

The reporter and the lad secured a good store of the precious
plant, and then returned to Granite House, where they smuggled it
in with as much precaution as if Pencroft had been the most
vigilant and severe of custom- house officers.

Cyrus Harding and Neb were taken into confidence, and the sailor
suspected nothing during the whole time, necessarily somewhat long,
which was required in order to dry the small leaves, chop them up,
and subject them to a certain torrefaction on hot stones. This took
two months; but all these manipulations were successfully carried
on unknown to Pencroft, for, occupied with the construction of his
boat, he only returned to Granite House at the hour of rest.
