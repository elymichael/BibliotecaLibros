"Indeed," answered Herbert, "nothing here betrays the presence
of man."

"Let us go down," said Pencroft, "and search."

The sailor and his two companions returned to the shore, to the
place where they had left the "Bonadventure."

They had decided to make the tour of the island on foot, before
exploring the interior; so that not a spot should escape their
investigations. The beach was easy to follow, and only in some
places was their way barred by large rocks, which, however, they
easily passed round. The explorers proceeded towards the south,
disturbing numerous flocks of sea-birds and herds of seals, which
threw themselves into the sea as soon as they saw the strangers at
a distance.

"Those beasts yonder," observed the reporter, "do not see men
for the first time. They fear them, therefore they must know
them."

An hour after their departure they arrived on the southern point
of the islet, terminated by a sharp cape, and proceeded towards the
north along the western coast, equally formed by sand and rocks,
the background bordered with thick woods.

There was not a trace of a habitation in any part, not the print
of a human foot on the shore of the island, which after four hours'
walking had been gone completely round.

It was to say the least very extraordinary, and they were
compelled to believe that Tabor Island was not or was no longer
inhabited. Perhaps, after all the document was already several
months or several years old, and it was possible in this case,
either that the castaway had been enabled to return to his country,
or that he had died of misery.

Pencroft, Spilett, and Herbert, forming more or less probable
conjectures, dined rapidly on board the "Bonadventure" so as to be
able to continue their excursion until nightfall. This was done at
five o'clock in the evening, at which hour they entered the
wood.

Numerous animals fled at their approach, being principally, one
might say, only goats and pigs, which were obviously European
species.
