Gideon Spilett had very artistically arranged on the rocky
projections around the windows plants of different kinds, as well
as long streaming grass, so that the openings were picturesquely
framed in green, which had a pleasing effect.

The inhabitants of this solid, healthy, and secure dwelling,
could not but be charmed with their work. The view from the windows
extended over a boundless horizon, which was closed by the two
Mandible Capes on the north, and Claw Cape on the south. All Union
Bay was spread before them. Yes, our brave settlers had reason to
be satisfied, and Pencroft was lavish in his praise of what he
humorously called, "his apartments on the fifth floor above the
ground!"
