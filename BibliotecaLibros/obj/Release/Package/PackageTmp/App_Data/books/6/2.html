<br/><br/>About Verne:<br/><br/>Jules Gabriel Verne (February 8, 1828â€“March 24, 1905) was a<br/>French author who pioneered the science-fiction genre. He is best<br/>known for novels such as Journey To The Center Of The Earth (1864),<br/>Twenty Thousand Leagues Under The Sea (1870), and Around the World<br/>in Eighty Days (1873). Verne wrote about space, air, and underwater<br/>travel before air travel and practical submarines were invented,<br/>and before practical means of space travel had been devised. He is<br/>the third most translated author in the world, according to Index<br/>Translationum. Some of his books have been made into films. Verne,<br/>along with Hugo Gernsback and H. G. Wells, is often popularly<br/>referred to as the "Father of Science Fiction".
