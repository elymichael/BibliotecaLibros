<br/>"In fact," said the reporter, "instead of building a house it<br/>would be more important to build a boat, if by chance we are not<br/>more than a hundred miles from an inhabited coast."<br/><br/>"That is why," returned Harding, "I am going to try this evening<br/>to calculate the latitude of Lincoln Island, and to-morrow, at<br/>midday, I will try to calculate the longitude."<br/><br/>If the engineer had possessed a sextant, an apparatus with which<br/>the angular distance of objects can be measured with great<br/>precision, there would have been no difficulty in the operation.<br/>This evening by the height of the pole, the next day by the passing<br/>of the sun at the meridian, he would obtain the position of the<br/>island. But as they had not one he would have to supply the<br/>deficiency.<br/><br/>Harding then entered the Chimneys. By the light of the fire he<br/>cut two little flat rulers, which he joined together at one end so<br/>as to form a pair of compasses, whose legs could separate or come<br/>together. The fastening was fixed with a strong acacia thorn which<br/>was found in the wood pile. This instrument finished, the engineer<br/>returned to the beach, but as it was necessary to take the height<br/>of the pole from above a clear horizon, that is, a sea horizon, and<br/>as Claw Cape hid the southern horizon, he was obliged to look for a<br/>more suitable station. The best would evidently have been the shore<br/>exposed directly to the south; but the Mercy would have to be<br/>crossed, and that was a difficulty. Harding resolved, in<br/>consequence, to make his observation from Prospect Heights, taking<br/>into consideration its height above the level of the seaâ€”a height<br/>which he intended to calculate next day by a simple process of<br/>elementary geometry.<br/><br/>The settlers, therefore, went to the plateau, ascending the left<br/>bank of the Mercy, and placed themselves on the edge which looked<br/>northwest and southeast, that is, above the curiously-shaped rocks<br/>which bordered the river.<br/><br/>This part of the plateau commanded the heights of the left bank,<br/>which sloped away to the extremity of Claw Cape, and to the<br/>southern side of the island. No obstacle intercepted their gaze,<br/>which swept the horizon in a semi-circle from the cape to Reptile<br/>End. To the south the horizon, lighted by the first rays of the<br/>moon, was very clearly defined against the sky.<br/><br/>At this moment the Southern Cross presented itself to the<br/>observer in an inverted position, the star Alpha marking its base,<br/>which is nearer to the southern pole.<br/><br/>This constellation is not situated as near to the antarctic pole<br/>as the Polar Star is to the arctic pole. The star Alpha is about<br/>twenty-seven degrees from it, but Cyrus Harding knew this and made<br/>allowance for it in his calculation. He took care also to observe<br/>the moment when it passed the meridian below the pole, which would<br/>simplify the operation.<br/><br/>Cyrus Harding pointed one leg of the compasses to the horizon,<br/>the other to Alpha, and the space between the two legs gave him the<br/>angular distance which separated Alpha from the horizon. In order<br/>to fix the angle obtained, he fastened with thorns the two pieces<br/>of wood on a third placed transversely, so that their separation<br/>should be properly maintained.<br/><br/>That done, there was only the angle to calculate by bringing<br/>back the observation to the level of the sea, taking into<br/>consideration the depression of the horizon, which would<br/>necessitate measuring the height of the cliff. The value of this<br/>angle would give the height of Alpha, and consequently that of the<br/>pole above the horizon, that is to say, the latitude of the island,<br/>since the latitude of a point of the globe is always equal to the<br/>height of the pole above the horizon of this point.<br/><br/>
