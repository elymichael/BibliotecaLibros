<br/>"That must be a jacamar," said Herbert, trying to get<br/>nearer.<br/><br/>"This will be a good opportunity to taste jacamar," replied the<br/>sailor, "if that fellow is in a humor to be roasted!"<br/><br/>Just then, a stone cleverly thrown by the boy, struck the<br/>creature on the wing, but the blow did not disable it, and the<br/>jacamar ran off and disappeared in an instant.<br/><br/>"How clumsy I am!" cried Herbert.<br/><br/>"No, no, my boy!" replied the sailor. "The blow was well aimed;<br/>many a one would have missed it altogether! Come, don't be vexed<br/>with yourself. We shall catch it another day!"<br/><br/>As the hunters advanced, the trees were found to be more<br/>scattered, many being magnificent, but none bore eatable fruit.<br/>Pencroft searched in vain for some of those precious palm-trees<br/>which are employed in so many ways in domestic life, and which have<br/>been found as far as the fortieth parallel in the Northern<br/>Hemisphere, and to the thirty-fifth only in the Southern<br/>Hemisphere. But this forest was only composed of coniferae, such as<br/>deodaras, already recognized by Herbert, and Douglas pine, similar<br/>to those which grow on the northwest coast of America, and splendid<br/>firs, measuring a hundred and fifty feet in height.<br/><br/>At this moment a flock of birds, of a small size and pretty<br/>plumage, with long glancing tails, dispersed themselves among the<br/>branches strewing their feathers, which covered the ground as with<br/>fine down. Herbert picked up a few of these feathers, and after<br/>having examined them,—<br/><br/>"These are couroucous," said he.<br/><br/>"I should prefer a moor-cock or guinea-fowl," replied Pencroft,<br/>"still, if they are good to eat—"<br/><br/>"They are good to eat, and also their flesh is very delicate,"<br/>replied Herbert. "Besides, if I don't mistake, it is easy to<br/>approach and kill them with a stick."<br/><br/>
