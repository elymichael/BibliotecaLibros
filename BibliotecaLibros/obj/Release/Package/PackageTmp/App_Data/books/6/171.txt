So, then, the island was, or had been, inhabited by others than
the settlers. Proved as it was by the incident of the bullet, it
was hereafter an unquestionable fact, and such a discovery could
not but cause great uneasiness among the colonists.

Cyrus Harding and Gideon Spilett, before sleeping, conversed
long about the matter. They asked themselves if by chance this
incident might not have some connection with the inexplicable way
in which the engineer had been saved, and the other peculiar
circumstances which had struck them at different times. However,
Cyrus Harding, after having discussed the pros and cons of the
question, ended by saying,—

"In short, would you like to know my opinion, my dear
Spilett?"

"Yes, Cyrus."

"Well, then, it is this: however minutely we explore the island,
we shall find nothing."

The next day Pencroft set to work. He did not mean to build a
boat with boards and planking, but simply a flat-bottomed canoe,
which would be well suited for navigating the Mercy—above all, for
approaching its source, where the water would naturally be shallow.
Pieces of bark, fastened one to the other, would form a light boat;
and in case of natural obstacles, which would render a portage
necessary, it would be easily carried. Pencroft intended to secure
the pieces of bark by means of nails, to insure the canoe being
water-tight.

It was first necessary to select the trees which would afford a
strong and supple bark for the work. Now the last storm had brought
down a number of large birch-trees, the bark of which would be
perfectly suited for their purpose. Some of these trees lay on the
ground, and they had only to be barked, which was the most
difficult thing of all, owing to the imperfect tools which the
settlers possessed. However, they overcame all difficulties.

While the sailor, seconded by the engineer, thus occupied
himself without losing an hour, Gideon Spilett and Herbert were not
idle.

They were made purveyors to the colony. The reporter could not
but admire the boy, who had acquired great skill in handling the
bow and spear. Herbert also showed great courage and much of that
presence of mind which may justly be called "the reasoning of
bravery." These two companions of the chase, remembering Cyrus
Harding's recommendations, did not go beyond a radius of two miles
round Granite House; but the borders of the forest furnished a
sufficient tribute of agoutis, capybaras, kangaroos, peccaries,
etc.; and if the result from the traps was less than during the
cold, still the warren yielded its accustomed quota, which might
have fed all the colony in Lincoln Island.

Often during these excursions, Herbert talked with Gideon
Spilett on the incident of the bullet, and the deductions which the
engineer drew from it, and one day—it was the 26th of October—he
said—"But, Mr. Spilett, do you not think it very extraordinary
that, if any castaways have landed on the island, they have not yet
shown themselves near Granite House?"

"Very astonishing if they are still here," replied the reporter,
"but not astonishing at all if they are here no longer!"
