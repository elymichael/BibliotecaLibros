The stranger, however, had seen nothing of his new dwelling, and
he had allowed the settlers to work there without him, while he
occupied himself on the plateau, wishing, doubtless, to put the
finishing stroke to his work. Indeed, thanks to him, all the ground
was dug up and ready to he sowed when the time came.

It was on the 20th of December that all the arrangements at the
corral were completed. The engineer announced to the stranger that
his dwelling was ready to receive him, and the latter replied that
he would go and sleep there that very evening.

On this evening the colonists were gathered in the diningroom of
Granite House. It was then eight o'clock, the hour at which their
companion was to leave them. Not wishing to trouble him by their
presence, and thus imposing on him the necessity of saying
farewells which might perhaps be painful to him, they had left him
alone and ascended to Granite House.

Now, they had been talking in the room for a few minutes, when a
light knock was heard at the door. Almost immediately the stranger
entered, and without any preamble,â€”

"Gentlemen," said he, "before I leave you, it is right that you
should know my history. I will tell it you."

These simple words profoundly impressed Cyrus Harding and his
companions. The engineer rose.

"We ask you nothing, my friend," said he; "it is your right to
be silent."

"It is my duty to speak."

"Sit down, then."

"No, I will stand."

"We are ready to hear you," replied Harding.
