Before anything else could be done it was necessary to make the<br/>iron ore, of which the engineer had observed some traces in the<br/>northwest part of the island, fit for use by converting it either<br/>into iron or into steel.<br/><br/>Metals are not generally found in the ground in a pure state.<br/>For the most part they are combined with oxygen or sulphur. Such<br/>was the case with the two specimens which Cyrus Harding had brought<br/>back, one of magnetic iron, not carbonated, the other a pyrite,<br/>also called sulphuret of iron. It was, therefore the first, the<br/>oxide of iron, which they must reduce with coal, that is to say,<br/>get rid of the oxygen, to obtain it in a pure state. This reduction<br/>is made by subjecting the ore with coal to a high temperature,<br/>either by the rapid and easy Catalan method, which has the<br/>advantage of transforming the ore into iron in a single operation,<br/>or by the blast furnace, which first smelts the ore, then changes<br/>it into iron, by carrying away the three to four per cent. of coal,<br/>which is combined with it.<br/><br/>Now Cyrus Harding wanted iron, and he wished to obtain it as<br/>soon as possible. The ore which he had picked up was in itself very<br/>pure and rich. It was the oxydulous iron, which is found in<br/>confused masses of a deep gray color; it gives a black dust,<br/>crystallized in the form of the regular octahedron. Native<br/>lodestones consist of this ore, and iron of the first quality is<br/>made in Europe from that with which Sweden and Norway are so<br/>abundantly supplied. Not far from this vein was the vein of coal<br/>already made use of by the settlers. The ingredients for the<br/>manufacture being close together would greatly facilitate the<br/>treatment of the ore. This is the cause of the wealth of the mines<br/>in Great Britain, where the coal aids the manufacture of the metal<br/>extracted from the same soil at the same time as itself.<br/><br/>"Then, captain," said Pencroft, "we are going to work iron<br/>ore?"<br/><br/>"Yes, my friend," replied the engineer, "and for that—something<br/>which will please you—we must begin by having a seal hunt on the<br/>islet."<br/><br/>"A seal hunt!" cried the sailor, turning towards Gideon Spilett.<br/>"Are seals needed to make iron?"<br/><br/>"Since Cyrus has said so!" replied the reporter.<br/><br/>But the engineer had already left the Chimneys, and Pencroft<br/>prepared for the seal hunt, without having received any other<br/>explanation.<br/><br/>Cyrus Harding, Herbert, Gideon Spilett, Neb, and the sailor were<br/>soon collected on the shore, at a place where the channel left a<br/>ford passable at low tide. The hunters could therefore traverse it<br/>without getting wet higher than the knee.<br/><br/>Harding then put his foot on the islet for the first, and his<br/>companions for the second time.<br/><br/>On their landing some hundreds of penguins looked fearlessly at<br/>them. The hunters, armed with sticks, could have killed them<br/>easily, but they were not guilty of such useless massacre, as it<br/>was important not to frighten the seals, who were lying on the sand<br/>several cable lengths off. They also respected certain<br/>innocent-looking birds, whose wings were reduced to the state of<br/>stumps, spread out like fins, ornamented with feathers of a scaly<br/>appearance. The settlers, therefore, prudently advanced towards the<br/>north point, walking over ground riddled with little holes, which<br/>formed nests for the sea-birds. Towards the extremity of the islet<br/>appeared great black heads floating just above the water, having<br/>exactly the appearance of rocks in motion.<br/>
