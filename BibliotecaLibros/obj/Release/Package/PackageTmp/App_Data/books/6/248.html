For some days they had observed an enormous animal two or three<br/>miles out in the open sea swimming around Lincoln Island. This was<br/>a whale of the largest size, which apparently belonged to the<br/>southern species, called the "Cape Whale."<br/><br/>"What a lucky chance it would be if we could capture it!" cried<br/>the sailor. "Ah! if we only had a proper boat and a good harpoon, I<br/>would say 'After the beast,' for he would be well worth the trouble<br/>of catching!"<br/><br/>"Well, Pencroft," observed Harding, "I should much like to watch<br/>you handling a harpoon. It would be very interesting."<br/><br/>"I am astonished," said the reporter, "to see a whale in this<br/>comparatively high latitude."<br/><br/>"Why so, Mr. Spilett?" replied Herbert. "We are exactly in that<br/>part of the Pacific which English and American whalemen call the<br/>whale field, and it is here, between New Zealand and South America,<br/>that the whales of the Southern Hemisphere are met with in the<br/>greatest numbers."<br/><br/>And Pencroft returned to his work, not without uttering a sigh<br/>of regret, for every sailor is a born fisherman, and if the<br/>pleasure of fishing is in exact proportion to the size of the<br/>animal, one can judge how a whaler feels in sight of a whale. And<br/>if this had only been for pleasure! But they could not help feeling<br/>how valuable such a prize would have been to the colony, for the<br/>oil, fat, and bones would have been put to many uses.<br/><br/>Now it happened that this whale appeared to have no wish to<br/>leave the waters of the island. Therefore, whether from the windows<br/>of Granite House, or from Prospect Heights, Herbert and Gideon<br/>Spilett, when they were not hunting, or Neb, unless presiding over<br/>his fires, never left the telescope, but watched all the animal's<br/>movements. The cetacean, having entered far into Union Bay, made<br/>rapid furrows across it from Mandible Cape to Claw Cape, propelled<br/>by its enormously powerful flukes, on which it supported itself,<br/>and making its way through the water at the rate little short of<br/>twelve knots an hour. Sometimes also it approached so near to the<br/>island that it could be clearly distinguished. It was the southern<br/>whale, which is completely black, the head being more depressed<br/>than that of the northern whale.<br/><br/>They could also see it throwing up from its air-holes to a great<br/>height a cloud of vapor, or of water, for, strange as it may<br/>appear, naturalists and whalers are not agreed on this subject. Is<br/>it air or is it water which is thus driven out? It is generally<br/>admitted to be vapor, which, condensing suddenly by contact with<br/>the cold air, falls again as rain.<br/><br/>However, the presence of this mammifer preoccupied the<br/>colonists. It irritated Pencroft especially, as he could think of<br/>nothing else while at work. He ended by longing for it, like a<br/>child for a thing which it has been denied. At night he talked<br/>about it in his sleep, and certainly if he had had the means of<br/>attacking it, if the sloop had been in a fit state to put to sea,<br/>he would not have hesitated to set out in pursuit.<br/><br/>But what the colonists could not do for themselves chance did<br/>for them, and on the 3rd of May shouts from Neb, who had stationed<br/>himself at the kitchen window, announced that the whale was<br/>stranded on the beach of the island.<br/><br/>Herbert and Gideon Spilett, who were just about to set out<br/>hunting, left their guns, Pencroft threw down his ax, and Harding<br/>and Neb joining their companions, all rushed towards the scene of<br/>action.<br/>
