<br/>The sailor rushed out, followed by the boy. On the sand, among<br/>the rocks, near the river's bank, they both searched carefully, but<br/>in vain. The box was of copper, and therefore would have been<br/>easily seen.<br/><br/>"Pencroft," asked Herbert, "didn't you throw it out of the<br/>car?"<br/><br/>"I knew better than that," replied the sailor; "but such a small<br/>article could easily disappear in the tumbling about we have gone<br/>through. I would rather even have lost my pipe! Confound the box!<br/>Where can it be?"<br/><br/>"Look here, the tide is going down," said Herbert; "let's run to<br/>the place where we landed."<br/><br/>It was scarcely probable that they would find the box, which the<br/>waves had rolled about among the pebbles, at high tide, but it was<br/>as well to try. Herbert and Pencroft walked rapidly to the point<br/>where they had landed the day before, about two hundred feet from<br/>the cave. They hunted there, among the shingle, in the clefts of<br/>the rocks, but found nothing. If the box had fallen at this place<br/>it must have been swept away by the waves. As the sea went down,<br/>they searched every little crevice with no result. It was a grave<br/>loss in their circumstances, and for the time irreparable. Pencroft<br/>could not hide his vexation; he looked very anxious, but said not a<br/>word. Herbert tried to console him by observing, that if they had<br/>found the matches, they would, very likely, have been wetted by the<br/>sea and useless.<br/><br/>"No, my boy," replied the sailor; "they were in a copper box<br/>which shut very tightly; and now what are we to do?"<br/><br/>"We shall certainly find some way of making a fire," said<br/>Herbert. "Captain Harding or Mr. Spilett will not be without<br/>them."<br/><br/>"Yes," replied Pencroft; "but in the meantime we are without<br/>fire, and our companions will find but a sorry repast on their<br/>return."<br/><br/>"But," said Herbert quickly, "do you think it possible that they<br/>have no tinder or matches?"<br/><br/>"I doubt it," replied the sailor, shaking his head, "for neither<br/>Neb nor Captain Harding smoke, and I believe that Mr. Spilett would<br/>rather keep his note-book than his match-box."<br/><br/>
