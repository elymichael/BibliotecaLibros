<br/>And, at this moment, as if to bear witness to the truth of the<br/>sailor's words, two or three quadrumana showed themselves at the<br/>windows, from which they had pushed back the shutters, and saluted<br/>the real proprietors of the place with a thousand hideous<br/>grimaces.<br/><br/>"I knew that it was only a joke," cried Pencroft; "but one of<br/>the jokers shall pay the penalty for the rest."<br/><br/>So saying, the sailor, raising his piece, took a rapid aim at<br/>one of the monkeys and fired. All disappeared, except one who fell<br/>mortally wounded on the beach. This monkey, which was of a large<br/>size, evidently belonged to the first order of the quadrumana.<br/>Whether this was a chimpanzee, an orangoutang, or a gorilla, he<br/>took rank among the anthropoid apes, who are so called from their<br/>resemblance to the human race. However, Herbert declared it to be<br/>an orangoutang.<br/><br/>"What a magnificent beast!" cried Neb.<br/><br/>"Magnificent, if you like," replied Pencroft; "but still I do<br/>not see how we are to get into our house."<br/><br/>"Herbert is a good marksman," said the reporter, "and his bow is<br/>here. He can try again."<br/><br/>"Why, these apes are so cunning," returned Pencroft; "they won't<br/>show themselves again at the windows and so we can't kill them; and<br/>when I think of the mischief they may do in the rooms and<br/>storehouseâ€”"<br/><br/>"Have patience," replied Harding; "these creatures cannot keep<br/>us long at bay."<br/><br/>"I shall not be sure of that till I see them down here," replied<br/>the sailor. "And now, captain, do you know how many dozens of these<br/>fellows are up there?"<br/><br/>It was difficult to reply to Pencroft, and as for the young boy<br/>making another attempt, that was not easy; for the lower part of<br/>the ladder had been drawn again into the door, and when another<br/>pull was given, the line broke and the ladder remained firm. The<br/>case was really perplexing. Pencroft stormed. There was a comic<br/>side to the situation, but he did not think it funny at all. It was<br/>certain that the settlers would end by reinstating themselves in<br/>their domicile and driving out the intruders, but when and how?<br/>this is what they were not able to say.<br/><br/>
