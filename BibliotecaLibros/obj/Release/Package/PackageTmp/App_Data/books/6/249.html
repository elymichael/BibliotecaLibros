<br/>The stranding had taken place on the beach of Flotsam Point,<br/>three miles from Granite House, and at high tide. It was therefore<br/>probable that the cetacean would not be able to extricate itself<br/>easily; at any rate it was best to hasten, so as to cut off its<br/>retreat if necessary. They ran with pick-axes and iron-tipped poles<br/>in their hands, passed over the Mercy bridge, descended the right<br/>bank of the river, along the beach, and in less than twenty minutes<br/>the settlers were close to the enormous animal, above which flocks<br/>of birds already hovered.<br/><br/>"What a monster!" cried Neb.<br/><br/>And the exclamation was natural, for it was a southern whale,<br/>eighty feet long, a giant of the species, probably not weighing<br/>less than a hundred and fifty thousand pounds!<br/><br/>In the meanwhile, the monster thus stranded did not move, nor<br/>attempt by struggling to regain the water while the tide was still<br/>high.<br/><br/>It was dead, and a harpoon was sticking out of its left<br/>side.<br/><br/>"There are whalers in these quarters, then?" said Gideon Spilett<br/>directly.<br/><br/>"Oh, Mr. Spilett, that doesn't prove anything!" replied<br/>Pencroft. "Whales have been known to go thousands of miles with a<br/>harpoon in the side, and this one might even have been struck in<br/>the north of the Atlantic and come to die in the south of the<br/>Pacific, and it would be nothing astonishing."<br/><br/>Pencroft, having torn the harpoon from the animal's side, read<br/>this inscription on it:<br/><br/>MARIA STELLA, VINEYARD<br/><br/>"A vessel from the Vineyard! A ship from my country!" he cried.<br/>"The 'Maria Stella!' A fine whaler, 'pon my word; I know her well!<br/>Oh, my friends, a vessel from the Vineyard!â€”a whaler from the<br/>Vineyard!"<br/><br/>
