In a few hours Herbert was much calmer. The colonists could now<br/>discuss this incident. The intervention of the stranger was more<br/>evident than ever. But how had he been able to penetrate during the<br/>night into Granite House? It was inexplicable, and, in truth, the<br/>proceedings of the genius of the island were not less mysterious<br/>than was that genius himself. During this day the sulphate of<br/>quinine was administered to Herbert every three hours.<br/><br/>The next day some improvement in Herbert's condition was<br/>apparent. Certainly, he was not out of danger, intermittent fevers<br/>being subject to frequent and dangerous relapses, but the most<br/>assiduous care was bestowed on him. And besides, the specific was<br/>at hand; nor, doubtless, was he who had brought it far distant! And<br/>the hearts of all were animated by returning hope.<br/><br/>This hope was not disappointed. Ten days after, on the 20th of<br/>December, Herbert's convalescence commenced.<br/><br/>He was still weak, and strict diet had been imposed upon him,<br/>but no access of fever supervened. And then, the poor boy submitted<br/>with such docility to all the prescriptions ordered him! He longed<br/>so to get well!<br/><br/>Pencroft was as a man who has been drawn up from the bottom of<br/>an abyss. Fits of joy approaching delirium seized him. When the<br/>time for the third attack had passed by, he nearly suffocated the<br/>reporter in his embrace. Since then, he always called him Dr.<br/>Spilett.<br/><br/>The real doctor, however, remained undiscovered.<br/><br/>"We will find him!" repeated the sailor.<br/><br/>Certainly, this man, whoever he was, might expect a somewhat too<br/>energetic embrace from the worthy Pencroft!<br/><br/>The month of December ended, and with it the year 1867, during<br/>which the colonists of Lincoln Island had of late been so severely<br/>tried. They commenced the year 1868 with magnificent weather, great<br/>heat, and a tropical temperature, delightfully cooled by the<br/>sea-breeze. Herbert's recovery progressed, and from his bed, placed<br/>near one of the windows of Granite House, he could inhale the fresh<br/>air, charged with ozone, which could not fail to restore his<br/>health. His appetite returned, and what numberless delicate, savory<br/>little dishes Neb prepared for him!<br/><br/>"It is enough to make one wish to have a fever oneself!" said<br/>Pencroft.<br/><br/>During all this time, the convicts did not once appear in the<br/>vicinity of Granite House. There was no news of Ayrton, and though<br/>the engineer and Herbert still had some hopes of finding him again,<br/>their companions did not doubt but that the unfortunate man had<br/>perished. However, this uncertainty could not last, and when once<br/>the lad should have recovered, the expedition, the result of which<br/>must be so important, would be undertaken. But they would have to<br/>wait a month, perhaps, for all the strength of the colony must be<br/>put into requisition to obtain satisfaction from the convicts.<br/>
