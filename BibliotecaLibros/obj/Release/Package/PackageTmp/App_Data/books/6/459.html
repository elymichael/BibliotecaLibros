<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>13<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>How had it happened? who had killed the convicts? Was it Ayrton?<br/>No, for a moment before he was dreading their return.<br/><br/>But Ayrton was now in a profound stupor, from which it was no<br/>longer possible to rouse him. After uttering those few words he had<br/>again become unconscious, and had fallen back motionless on the<br/>bed.<br/><br/>The colonists, a prey to a thousand confused thoughts, under the<br/>influence of violent excitement, waited all night, without leaving<br/>Ayrton's house, or returning to the spot where lay the bodies of<br/>the convicts. It was very probable that Ayrton would not be able to<br/>throw any light on the circumstances under which the bodies had<br/>been found, since he himself was not aware that he was in the<br/>corral. But at any rate he would be in a position to give an<br/>account of what had taken place before this terrible execution. The<br/>next day Ayrton awoke from his torpor, and his companions cordially<br/>manifested all the joy they felt, on seeing him again, almost safe<br/>and sound, after a hundred and four days separation.<br/><br/>Ayrton then in a few words recounted what had happened, or, at<br/>least, as much as he knew.<br/><br/>The day after his arrival at the corral, on the 10th of last<br/>November, at nightfall, he was surprised by the convicts, who had<br/>scaled the palisade. They bound and gagged him; then he was led to<br/>a dark cavern, at the foot of Mount Franklin, where the convicts<br/>had taken refuge.<br/><br/>His death had been decided upon, and the next day the convicts<br/>were about to kill him, when one of them recognized him and called<br/>him by the name which he bore in Australia. The wretches had no<br/>scruples as to murdering Ayrton! They spared Ben Joyce!<br/><br/>
