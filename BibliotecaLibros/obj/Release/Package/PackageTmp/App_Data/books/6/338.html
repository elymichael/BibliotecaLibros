<br/>"Well!" answered Pencroft, "I agree with you that the nobleman<br/>will return, and soon too. But where will he touch? At Tabor<br/>Island, and not at Lincoln Island."<br/><br/>"That is the more certain," replied Herbert, "as Lincoln Island<br/>is not even marked on the map."<br/><br/>"Therefore, my friends," said the engineer, "we ought to take<br/>the necessary precautions for making our presence and that of<br/>Ayrton on Lincoln Island known at Tabor Island."<br/><br/>"Certainly," answered the reporter, "and nothing is easier than<br/>to place in the hut, which was Captain Grant's and Ayrton's<br/>dwelling, a notice which Lord Glenarvan and his crew cannot help<br/>finding, giving the position of our island."<br/><br/>"It is a pity," remarked the sailor, "that we forgot to take<br/>that precaution on our first visit to Tabor Island."<br/><br/>"And why should we have done it?" asked Herbert. "At that time<br/>we did not know Ayrton's history; we did not know that any one was<br/>likely to come some day to fetch him, and when we did know his<br/>history, the season was too advanced to allow us to return then to<br/>Tabor Island."<br/><br/>"Yes," replied Harding, "it was too late, and we must put off<br/>the voyage until next spring."<br/><br/>"But suppose the Scotch yacht comes before that," said<br/>Pencroft.<br/><br/>"That is not probable," replied the engineer, "for Lord<br/>Glenarvan would not choose the winter season to venture into these<br/>seas. Either he has already returned to Tabor Island, since Ayrton<br/>has been with us, that is to say, during the last five months and<br/>has left again; or he will not come till later, and it will be time<br/>enough in the first fine October days to go to Tabor Island, and<br/>leave a notice there."<br/><br/>"We must allow," said Neb, "that it will be very unfortunate if<br/>the 'Duncan' has returned to these parts only a few months<br/>ago!"<br/><br/>
