"Ayrton then related all his life, and it was certain that he
knew nothing from the day on which Captain Grant had landed him on
the Australian coast.

"Nevertheless, Lord Glenarvan kept the promise which he had
given. The 'Duncan' continued her voyage and arrived at Tabor
Island. It was there that Ayrton was to be landed, and it was there
also that, by a veritable miracle, they found Captain Grant and two
men, exactly on the thirty- seventh parallel.

"The convict, then, went to take their place on this desert
islet, and at the moment he left the yacht these words were
pronounced by Lord Glenarvan:â€”

"'Here, Ayrton, you will be far from any land, and without any
possible communication with your fellow-creatures. You can-not
escape from this islet on which the 'Duncan' leaves you. You will
be alone, under the eye of a God who reads the depths of the heart,
but you will be neither lost nor forgotten, as was Captain Grant.
Unworthy as you are to be remembered by men, men will remember you.
I know where you are Ayrton, and I know where to find you. I will
never forget it!

"And the 'Duncan,' making sail, soon disappeared. This was 18th
of March, 1855.

(The events which have just been briefly related are taken from
a

work which some of our readers have no doubt read, and which
is

entitled, "Captain Grant's children." They will remark on
this

occasion, as well as later, some discrepancy in the dates;
but

later again, they will understand why the real dates were not
at

first given.)
