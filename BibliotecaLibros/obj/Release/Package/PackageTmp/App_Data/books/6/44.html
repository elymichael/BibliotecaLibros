"Yes—yes!" replied Pencroft.<br/><br/>"It is Top! It is Top!" cried Herbert, who had just awoke; and<br/>all three rushed towards the opening of the Chimneys. They had<br/>great difficulty in getting out. The wind drove them back. But at<br/>last they succeeded, and could only remain standing by leaning<br/>against the rocks. They looked about, but could not speak. The<br/>darkness was intense. The sea, the sky, the land were all mingled<br/>in one black mass. Not a speck of light was visible.<br/><br/>The reporter and his companions remained thus for a few minutes,<br/>overwhelmed by the wind, drenched by the rain, blinded by the<br/>sand.<br/><br/>Then, in a pause of the tumult, they again heard the barking,<br/>which they found must be at some distance.<br/><br/>It could only be Top! But was he alone or accompanied? He was<br/>most probably alone, for, if Neb had been with him, he would have<br/>made his way more directly towards the Chimneys. The sailor<br/>squeezed the reporter's hand, for he could not make himself heard,<br/>in a way which signified "Wait!" then he reentered the passage.<br/><br/>An instant after he issued with a lighted fagot, which he threw<br/>into the darkness, whistling shrilly.<br/><br/>It appeared as if this signal had been waited for; the barking<br/>immediately came nearer, and soon a dog bounded into the passage.<br/>Pencroft, Herbert, and Spilett entered after him.<br/><br/>An armful of dry wood was thrown on the embers. The passage was<br/>lighted up with a bright flame.<br/><br/>"It is Top!" cried Herbert.<br/><br/>It was indeed Top, a magnificent Anglo-Norman, who derived from<br/>these two races crossed the swiftness of foot and the acuteness of<br/>smell which are the preeminent qualities of coursing dogs. It was<br/>the dog of the engineer, Cyrus Harding. But he was alone! Neither<br/>Neb nor his master accompanied him!<br/><br/>How was it that his instinct had guided him straight to the<br/>Chimneys, which he did not know? It appeared inexplicable, above<br/>all, in the midst of this black night and in such a tempest! But<br/>what was still more inexplicable was, that Top was neither tired,<br/>nor exhausted, nor even soiled with mud or sand!—Herbert had drawn<br/>him towards him, and was patting his head, the dog rubbing his neck<br/>against the lad's hands.<br/>
