There the passage ended in a vast and magnificent cavern.

Top was running backwards and forwards, barking furiously.
Pencroft and Neb, waving their torches, threw the light into every
crevice; and at the same time, Harding, Gideon Spilett, and
Herbert, their spears raised, were ready for any emergency which
might arise. The enormous cavern was empty. The settlers explored
it in every direction. There was nothing there, not an animal, not
a human being; and yet Top continued to bark. Neither caresses nor
threats could make him be silent.

"There must be a place somewhere, by which the waters of the
lake reached the sea," said the engineer.

"Of course," replied Pencroft, "and we must take care not to
tumble into a hole."

"Go, Top, go!" cried Harding.

The dog, excited by his master's words, ran towards the
extremity of the cavern, and there redoubled his barking.

They followed him, and by the light of the torches, perceived
the mouth of a regular well in the granite. It was by this that the
water escaped; and this time it was not an oblique and practicable
passage, but a perpendicular well, into which it was impossible to
venture.

The torches were held over the opening: nothing could be seen.
Harding took a lighted branch, and threw it into the abyss. The
blazing resin, whose illuminating power increased still more by the
rapidity of its fall, lighted up the interior of the well, but yet
nothing appeared. The flame then went out with a slight hiss, which
showed that it had reached the water, that is to say, the level of
the sea.

The engineer, calculating the time employed in its fall, was
able to calculate the depth of the well, which was found to be
about ninety feet.

The floor of the cavern must thus be situated ninety feet above
the level of the sea.
