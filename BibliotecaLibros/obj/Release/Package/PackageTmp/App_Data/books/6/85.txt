"Why! our island! we have forgotten to christen it!"

Herbert was going to propose to give it the engineer's name and
all his companions would have applauded him, when Cyrus Harding
said simply,â€”

"Let us give it the name of a great citizen, my friend; of him
who now struggles to defend the unity of the American Republic! Let
us call it Lincoln Island!"

The engineer's proposal was replied to by three hurrahs.

And that evening, before sleeping, the new colonists talked of
their absent country; they spoke of the terrible war which stained
it with blood; they could not doubt that the South would soon be
subdued, and that the cause of the North, the cause of justice,
would triumph, thanks to Grant, thanks to Lincoln!

Now this happened the 30th of March, 1865. They little knew that
sixteen days afterwards a frightful crime would be committed in
Washington, and that on Good Friday Abraham Lincoln would fall by
the hand of a fanatic.
