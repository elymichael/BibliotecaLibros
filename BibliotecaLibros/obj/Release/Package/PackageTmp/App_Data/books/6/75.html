In fact, before them opened a deep hollow. It was the rugged<br/>mouth of the crater, by which the eruptive liquid matter had<br/>escaped at the periods when the volcano was still in activity.<br/>Hardened lava and crusted scoria formed a sort of natural staircase<br/>of large steps, which would greatly facilitate the ascent to the<br/>summit of the mountain.<br/><br/>Harding took all this in at a glance, and without hesitating,<br/>followed by the lad, he entered the enormous chasm in the midst of<br/>an increasing obscurity.<br/><br/>There was still a height of a thousand feet to overcome. Would<br/>the interior acclivities of the crater be practicable? It would<br/>soon be seen. The persevering engineer resolved to continue his<br/>ascent until he was stopped. Happily these acclivities wound up the<br/>interior of the volcano and favored their ascent.<br/><br/>As to the volcano itself, it could not be doubted that it was<br/>completely extinct. No smoke escaped from its sides; not a flame<br/>could be seen in the dark hollows; not a roar, not a mutter, no<br/>trembling even issued from this black well, which perhaps reached<br/>far into the bowels of the earth. The atmosphere inside the crater<br/>was filled with no sulphurous vapor. It was more than the sleep of<br/>a volcano; it was its complete extinction. Cyrus Harding's attempt<br/>would succeed.<br/><br/>Little by little, Herbert and he climbing up the sides of the<br/>interior, saw the crater widen above their heads. The radius of<br/>this circular portion of the sky, framed by the edge of the cone,<br/>increased obviously. At each step, as it were, that the explorers<br/>made, fresh stars entered the field of their vision. The<br/>magnificent constellations of the southern sky shone resplendently.<br/>At the zenith glittered the splendid Antares in the Scorpion, and<br/>not far was Alpha Centauri, which is believed to be the nearest<br/>star to the terrestrial globe. Then, as the crater widened,<br/>appeared Fomalhaut of the Fish, the Southern Triangle, and lastly,<br/>nearly at the Antarctic Pole, the glittering Southern Cross, which<br/>replaces the Polar Star of the Northern Hemisphere.<br/><br/>It was nearly eight o'clock when Cyrus Harding and Herbert set<br/>foot on the highest ridge of the mountain at the summit of the<br/>cone.<br/><br/>It was then perfectly dark, and their gaze could not extend over<br/>a radius of two miles. Did the sea surround this unknown land, or<br/>was it connected in the west with some continent of the Pacific? It<br/>could not yet be made out. Towards the west, a cloudy belt, clearly<br/>visible at the horizon, increased the gloom, and the eye could not<br/>discover if the sky and water were blended together in the same<br/>circular line.<br/><br/>But at one point of the horizon a vague light suddenly appeared,<br/>which descended slowly in proportion as the cloud mounted to the<br/>zenith.<br/><br/>It was the slender crescent moon, already almost disappearing;<br/>but its light was sufficient to show clearly the horizontal line,<br/>then detached from the cloud, and the engineer could see its<br/>reflection trembling for an instant on a liquid surface. Cyrus<br/>Harding seized the lad's hand, and in a grave voice,â€”<br/><br/>"An island!" said he, at the moment when the lunar crescent<br/>disappeared beneath the waves.<br/><br/><br/>
