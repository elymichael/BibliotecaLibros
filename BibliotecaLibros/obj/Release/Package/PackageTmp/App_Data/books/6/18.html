"Yes," replied Neb, "and besides, Top is there."<br/><br/>The sailor, observing the heavy surf on the shore, shook his<br/>head.<br/><br/>The engineer had disappeared to the north of the shore, and<br/>nearly half a mile from the place where the castaways had landed.<br/>The nearest point of the beach he could reach was thus fully that<br/>distance off.<br/><br/>It was then nearly six o'clock. A thick fog made the night very<br/>dark. The castaways proceeded toward the north of the land on which<br/>chance had thrown them, an unknown region, the geographical<br/>situation of which they could not even guess. They were walking<br/>upon a sandy soil, mingled with stones, which appeared destitute of<br/>any sort of vegetation. The ground, very unequal and rough, was in<br/>some places perfectly riddled with holes, making walking extremely<br/>painful. From these holes escaped every minute great birds of<br/>clumsy flight, which flew in all directions. Others, more active,<br/>rose in flocks and passed in clouds over their heads. The sailor<br/>thought he recognized gulls and cormorants, whose shrill cries rose<br/>above the roaring of the sea.<br/><br/>From time to time the castaways stopped and shouted, then<br/>listened for some response from the ocean, for they thought that if<br/>the engineer had landed, and they had been near to the place, they<br/>would have heard the barking of the dog Top, even should Harding<br/>himself have been unable to give any sign of existence. They<br/>stopped to listen, but no sound arose above the roaring of the<br/>waves and the dashing of the surf. The little band then continued<br/>their march forward, searching into every hollow of the shore.<br/><br/>After walking for twenty minutes, the four castaways were<br/>suddenly brought to a standstill by the sight of foaming billows<br/>close to their feet. The solid ground ended here. They found<br/>themselves at the extremity of a sharp point on which the sea broke<br/>furiously.<br/><br/>"It is a promontory," said the sailor; "we must retrace our<br/>steps, holding towards the right, and we shall thus gain the<br/>mainland."<br/><br/>"But if he is there," said Neb, pointing to the ocean, whose<br/>waves shone of a snowy white in the darkness. "Well, let us call<br/>again," and all uniting their voices, they gave a vigorous shout,<br/>but there came no reply. They waited for a lull, then began again;<br/>still no reply.<br/><br/>The castaways accordingly returned, following the opposite side<br/>of the promontory, over a soil equally sandy and rugged. However,<br/>Pencroft observed that the shore was more equal, that the ground<br/>rose, and he declared that it was joined by a long slope to a hill,<br/>whose massive front he thought that he could see looming<br/>indistinctly through the mist. The birds were less numerous on this<br/>part of the shore; the sea was also less tumultuous, and they<br/>observed that the agitation of the waves was diminished. The noise<br/>of the surf was scarcely heard. This side of the promontory<br/>evidently formed a semicircular bay, which the sharp point<br/>sheltered from the breakers of the open sea. But to follow this<br/>direction was to go south, exactly opposite to that part of the<br/>coast where Harding might have landed. After a walk of a mile and a<br/>half, the shore presented no curve which would permit them to<br/>return to the north. This promontory, of which they had turned the<br/>point, must be attached to the mainland. The castaways, although<br/>their strength was nearly exhausted, still marched courageously<br/>forward, hoping every moment to meet with a sudden angle which<br/>would set them in the first direction. What was their<br/>disappointment, when, after trudging nearly two miles, having<br/>reached an elevated point composed of slippery rocks, they found<br/>themselves again stopped by the sea.<br/><br/>"We are on an islet," said Pencroft, "and we have surveyed it<br/>from one extremity to the other."<br/><br/>The sailor was right; they had been thrown, not on a continent,<br/>not even on an island, but on an islet which was not more than two<br/>miles in length, with even a less breadth.<br/>
