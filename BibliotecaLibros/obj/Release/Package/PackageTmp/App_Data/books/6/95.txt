Neb was devotion personified. Clever, intelligent,
indefatigable, robust, with iron health, he knew a little about the
work of the forge, and could not fail to be very useful in the
colony.

As to Pencroft, he had sailed over every sea, a carpenter in the
dockyards in Brooklyn, assistant tailor in the vessels of the
state, gardener, cultivator, during his holidays, etc., and like
all seamen, fit for anything, he knew how to do everything.

It would have been difficult to unite five men, better fitted to
struggle against fate, more certain to triumph over it.

"At the beginning," Cyrus Harding had said. Now this beginning
of which the engineer spoke was the construction of an apparatus
which would serve to transform the natural substances. The part
which heat plays in these transformations is known. Now fuel, wood
or coal, was ready for immediate use, an oven must be built to use
it.

"What is this oven for?" asked Pencroft.

"To make the pottery which we have need of," replied
Harding.

"And of what shall we make the oven?"

"With bricks."

"And the bricks?"

"With clay. Let us start, my friends. To save trouble, we will
establish our manufactory at the place of production. Neb will
bring provisions, and there will be no lack of fire to cook the
food."

"No," replied the reporter; "but if there is a lack of food for
want of instruments for the chase?"
