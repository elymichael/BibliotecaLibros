But during the night of the 8th an enormous column of vapor
escaping from the crater rose with frightful explosions to a height
of more than three thousand feet. The wall of Dakkar Grotto had
evidently given way under the pressure of gases, and the sea,
rushing through the central shalt into the igneous gulf, was at
once converted into vapor. But the crater could not afford a
sufficient outlet for this vapor. An explosion, which might have
been heard at a distance of a hundred miles, shook the air.
Fragments of mountains fell into the Pacific, and, in a few
minutes, the ocean rolled over the spot where Lincoln island once
stood.
