<br/>"But," as the sailor said, "they quite took the wind out of the<br/>sails of the Robinsons, for whom everything was done by a<br/>miracle."<br/><br/>In fact, they were energetic; an energetic man will succeed<br/>where an indolent one would vegetate and inevitably perish.<br/><br/>Herbert distinguished himself in these works. He was intelligent<br/>and active; understanding quickly, he performed well; and Cyrus<br/>Harding became more and more attached to the boy. Herbert had a<br/>lively and reverent love for the engineer. Pencroft saw the close<br/>sympathy which existed between the two, but he was not in the least<br/>jealous. Neb was Neb: he was what he would be always, courage,<br/>zeal, devotion, self-denial personified. He had the same faith in<br/>his master that Pencroft had, but he showed it less vehemently.<br/>When the sailor was enthusiastic, Neb always looked as if he would<br/>say, "Nothing could be more natural." Pencroft and he were great<br/>friends.<br/><br/>As to Gideon Spilett, he took part in the common work, and was<br/>not less skilful in it than his companions, which always rather<br/>astonished the sailor. A "journalist," clever, not only in<br/>understanding, but in performing everything.<br/><br/>The ladder was finally fixed on the 28th of May. There were not<br/>less than a hundred rounds in this perpendicular height of eighty<br/>feet. Harding had been able, fortunately, to divide it in two<br/>parts, profiting by an overhanging of the cliff which made a<br/>projection forty feet above the ground. This projection, carefully<br/>leveled by the pickaxe, made a sort of platform, to which they<br/>fixed the first ladder, of which the oscillation was thus<br/>diminished one-half, and a rope permitted it to be raised to the<br/>level of Granite House. As to the second ladder, it was secured<br/>both at its lower part, which rested on the projection, and at its<br/>upper end, which was fastened to the door. In short the ascent had<br/>been made much easier. Besides, Cyrus Harding hoped later to<br/>establish an hydraulic apparatus, which would avoid all fatigue and<br/>loss of time, for the inhabitants of Granite House.<br/><br/>The settlers soon became habituated to the use of this ladder.<br/>They were light and active, and Pencroft, as a sailor, accustomed<br/>to run up the masts and shrouds, was able to give them lessons. But<br/>it was also necessary to give them to Top. The poor dog, with his<br/>four paws, was not formed for this sort of exercise. But Pencroft<br/>was such a zealous master, that Top ended by properly performing<br/>his ascents, and soon mounted the ladder as readily as his brethren<br/>in the circus. It need not be said that the sailor was proud of his<br/>pupil. However, more than once Pencroft hoisted him on his back,<br/>which Top never complained of.<br/><br/>It must be mentioned here, that during these works, which were<br/>actively conducted, for the bad season was approaching, the<br/>alimentary question was not neglected. Every day, the reporter and<br/>Herbert, who had been voted purveyors to the colony, devoted some<br/>hours to the chase. As yet, they only hunted in Jacamar Wood, on<br/>the left of the river, because, for want of a bridge or boat, the<br/>Mercy had not yet been crossed. All the immense woods, to which the<br/>name of the Forests of the Far West had been given, were not<br/>explored. They reserved this important excursion for the first fine<br/>days of the next spring. But Jacamar Wood was full of game;<br/>kangaroos and boars abounded, and the hunters iron-tipped spears<br/>and bows and arrows did wonders. Besides, Herbert discovered<br/>towards the southwest point of the lagoon a natural warren, a<br/>slightly damp meadow, covered with willows and aromatic herbs which<br/>scented the air, such as thyme, basil, savory, all the<br/>sweet-scented species of the labiated plants, which the rabbits<br/>appeared to be particularly fond of.<br/><br/>On the reporter observing that since the table was spread for<br/>the rabbits, it was strange that the rabbits themselves should be<br/>wanting, the two sportsmen carefully explored the warren. At any<br/>rate, it produced an abundance of useful plants, and a naturalist<br/>would have had a good opportunity of studying many specimens of the<br/>vegetable kingdom. Herbert gathered several shoots of the basil,<br/>rosemary, balm, betony, etc., which possess different medicinal<br/>properties, some pectoral, astringent, febrifuge, others<br/>anti-spasmodic, or anti-rheumatic. When, afterwards, Pencroft asked<br/>the use of this collection of herbs,â€”<br/><br/>"For medicine," replied the lad, "to treat us when we are<br/>ill."<br/><br/>"Why should we be ill, since there are no doctors in the<br/>island?" asked Pencroft quite seriously.<br/><br/>
