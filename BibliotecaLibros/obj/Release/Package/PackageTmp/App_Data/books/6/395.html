<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>5<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>So, then, all was explained by the submarine explosion of this<br/>torpedo. Cyrus Harding could not be mistaken, as, during the war of<br/>the Union, he had had occasion to try these terrible engines of<br/>destruction. It was under the action of this cylinder, charged with<br/>some explosive substance, nitro- glycerine, picrate, or some other<br/>material of the same nature, that the water of the channel had been<br/>raised like a dome, the bottom of the brig crushed in, and she had<br/>sunk instantly, the damage done to her hull being so considerable<br/>that it was impossible to refloat her. The "Speedy" had not been<br/>able to withstand a torpedo that would have destroyed an ironclad<br/>as easily as a fishing-boat!<br/><br/>Yes! all was explained, everythingâ€”except the presence of the<br/>torpedo in the waters of the channel!<br/><br/>"My friends, then," said Cyrus Harding, "we can no longer be in<br/>doubt as to the presence of a mysterious being, a castaway like us,<br/>perhaps, abandoned on our island, and I say this in order that<br/>Ayrton may be acquainted with all the strange events which have<br/>occurred during these two years. Who this beneficent stranger is,<br/>whose intervention has, so fortunately for us, been manifested on<br/>many occasions, I cannot imagine. What his object can be in acting<br/>thus, in concealing himself after rendering us so many services, I<br/>cannot understand: But his services are not the less real, and are<br/>of such a nature that only a man possessed of prodigious power,<br/>could render them. Ayrton is indebted to him as much as we are,<br/>for, if it was the stranger who saved me from the waves after the<br/>fall from the balloon, evidently it was he who wrote the document,<br/>who placed the bottle in the channel, and who has made known to us<br/>the situation of our companion. I will add that it was he who<br/>guided that chest, provided with everything we wanted, and stranded<br/>it on Flotsam Point; that it was he who lighted that fire on the<br/>heights of the island, which permitted you to land; that it was he<br/>who fired that bullet found in the body of the peccary; that it was<br/>he who plunged that torpedo into the channel, which destroyed the<br/>brig; in a word, that all those inexplicable events, for which we<br/>could not assign a reason, are due to this mysterious being.<br/>Therefore, whoever he may be, whether shipwrecked, or exiled on our<br/>island, we shall be ungrateful, if we think ourselves freed from<br/>gratitude towards him. We have contracted a debt, and I hope that<br/>we shall one day pay it."<br/><br/>"You are right in speaking thus, my dear Cyrus," replied Gideon<br/>Spilett. "Yes, there is an almost all-powerful being, hidden in<br/>some part of the island, and whose influence has been singularly<br/>useful to our colony. I will add that the unknown appears to<br/>possess means of action which border on the supernatural, if in the<br/>events of practical life the supernatural were recognizable. Is it<br/>he who is in secret communication with us by the well in Granite<br/>House, and has he thus a knowledge of all our plans? Was it he who<br/>threw us that bottle, when the vessel made her first cruise? Was it<br/>he who threw Top out of the lake, and killed the dugong? Was it he,<br/>who as everything leads us to believe, saved you from the waves,<br/>and that under circumstances in which any one else would not have<br/>been able to act? If it was he, he possesses a power which renders<br/>him master of the elements."<br/><br/>The reporter's reasoning was just, and every one felt it to be<br/>so.<br/><br/>"Yes," rejoined Cyrus Harding, "if the intervention of a human<br/>being is not more questionable for us, I agree that he has at his<br/>disposal means of action beyond those possessed by humanity. There<br/>is a mystery still, but if we discover the man, the mystery will be<br/>discovered also. The question, then, is, ought we to respect the<br/>incognito of this generous being, or ought we to do everything to<br/>find him out? What is your opinion on the matter?"<br/><br/>
