"It seems to me," said Ayrton, who had reclined so as to place<br/>his ear to the ground, "it seems to me that I can hear a dull,<br/>rumbling sound, like that of a wagon loaded with bars of iron."<br/><br/>The colonists listened with the greatest attention, and were<br/>convinced that Ayrton was not mistaken. The rumbling was mingled<br/>with a subterranean roar, which formed a sort of rinforzando, and<br/>died slowly away, as if some violent storm had passed through the<br/>profundities of the globe. But no explosion properly so termed,<br/>could be heard. It might therefore be concluded that the vapors and<br/>smoke found a free passage through the central shaft; and that the<br/>safety-valve being sufficiently large, no convulsion would be<br/>produced, no explosion was to be apprehended.<br/><br/>"Well, then!" said Pencroft, "are we not going back to work? Let<br/>Mount Franklin smoke, groan, bellow, or spout forth fire and flame<br/>as much as it pleases, that is no reason why we should be idle!<br/>Come, Ayrton, Neb, Herbert, Captain Harding, Mr. Spilett, every one<br/>of us must turn to at our work to-day! We are going to place the<br/>keelson, and a dozen pair of hands would not be too many. Before<br/>two months I want our new 'Bonadventure'— for we shall keep the old<br/>name, shall we not?—to float on the waters of Port Balloon!<br/>Therefore there is not an hour to lose!"<br/><br/>All the colonists, their services thus requisitioned by<br/>Pencroft, descended to the dockyard, and proceeded to place the<br/>keelson, a thick mass of wood which forms the lower portion of a<br/>ship and unites firmly the timbers of the hull. It was an arduous<br/>undertaking, in which all took part.<br/><br/>They continued their labors during the whole of this day, the<br/>3rd of January, without thinking further of the volcano, which<br/>could not, besides, be seen from the shore of Granite House. But<br/>once or twice, large shadows, veiling the sun, which described its<br/>diurnal arc through an extremely clear sky, indicated that a thick<br/>cloud of smoke passed between its disc and the island. The wind,<br/>blowing on the shore, carried all these vapors to the westward.<br/>Cyrus Harding and Gideon Spilett remarked these somber appearances,<br/>and from time to time discussed the evident progress of the<br/>volcanic phenomena, but their work went on without interruption. It<br/>was, besides, of the first importance from every point of view,<br/>that the vessel should be finished with the least possible delay.<br/>In presence of the eventualities which might arise, the safety of<br/>the colonists would be to a great extent secured by their ship. Who<br/>could tell that it might not prove some day their only refuge?<br/><br/>In the evening, after supper, Cyrus Harding, Gideon Spilett, and<br/>Herbert again ascended the plateau of Prospect Heights. It was<br/>already dark, and the obscurity would permit them to ascertain if<br/>flames or incandescent matter thrown up by the volcano were mingled<br/>with the vapor and smoke accumulated at the mouth of the<br/>crater.<br/><br/>"The crater is on fire!" said Herbert, who, more active than his<br/>companion, first reached the plateau.<br/><br/>Mount Franklin, distant about six miles, now appeared like a<br/>gigantic torch, around the summit of which turned fuliginous<br/>flames. So much smoke, and possibly scoriae and cinders were<br/>mingled with them, that their light gleamed but faintly amid the<br/>gloom of the night. But a kind of lurid brilliancy spread over the<br/>island, against which stood out confusedly the wooded masses of the<br/>heights. Immense whirlwinds of vapor obscured the sky, through<br/>which glimmered a few stars.<br/><br/>"The change is rapid!" said the engineer.<br/><br/>"That is not surprising," answered the reporter. "The<br/>reawakening of the volcano already dates back some time. You may<br/>remember, Cyrus, that the first vapors appeared about the time we<br/>searched the sides of the mountain to discover Captain Nemo's<br/>retreat. It was, if I mistake not, about the 15th of October."<br/><br/>"Yes," replied Herbert, "two months and a half ago!"<br/>
