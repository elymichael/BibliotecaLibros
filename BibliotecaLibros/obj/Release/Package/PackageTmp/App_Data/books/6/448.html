"No," answered Pencroft, "and if he was not with them, it was<br/>because the wretches had already murdered him! but then these<br/>rascals have not a den to which they may be tracked like<br/>tigers!"<br/><br/>"No," replied the reporter, "it is more probable that they<br/>wander at random, and it is their interest to rove about until the<br/>time when they will be masters of the island!"<br/><br/>"The masters of the island!" exclaimed the sailor; "the masters<br/>of the island!â€¦ " he repeated, and his voice was choked, as if his<br/>throat was seized in an iron grasp. Then in a calmer tone, "Do you<br/>know, Captain Harding," said he, "what the ball is which I have<br/>rammed into my gun?"<br/><br/>"No, Pencroft!"<br/><br/>"It is the ball that went through Herbert's chest, and I promise<br/>you it won't miss its mark!"<br/><br/>But this just retaliation would not bring Ayrton back to life,<br/>and from the examination of the footprints left in the ground, they<br/>must, alas! conclude that all hopes of ever seeing him again must<br/>be abandoned.<br/><br/>That evening they encamped fourteen miles from Granite House,<br/>and Cyrus Harding calculated that they could not be more than five<br/>miles from Reptile Point.<br/><br/>And indeed, the next day the extremity of the peninsula was<br/>reached, and the whole length of the forest had been traversed; but<br/>there was nothing to indicate the retreat in which the convicts had<br/>taken refuge, nor that, no less secret, which sheltered the<br/>mysterious unknown.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
