As to Gideon Spilett, he devoured the shell-fish, then he laid
himself down on the sand, at the foot of a rock. He was very weak,
but calm. Herbert went up to him, and taking his hand, "Sir," said
he, "we have found a shelter which will be better than lying here.
Night is advancing. Come and rest! To-morrow we will search
farther."

The reporter got up, and guided by the boy went towards the
cave. On the way, Pencroft asked him in the most natural tone, if
by chance he happened to have a match or two.

The reporter stopped, felt in his pockets, but finding nothing
said, "I had some, but I must have thrown them away."

The seaman then put the same question to Neb and received the
same answer.

"Confound it!" exclaimed the sailor.

The reporter heard him and seizing his arm, "Have you no
matches?" he asked.

"Not one, and no fire in consequence."

"Ah!" cried Neb, "if my master was here, he would know what to
do!"

The four castaways remained motionless, looking uneasily at each
other. Herbert was the first to break the silence by saying, "Mr.
Spilett, you are a smoker and always have matches about you;
perhaps you haven't looked well, try again, a single match will be
enough!"

The reporter hunted again in the pockets of his trousers,
waistcoat, and great-coat, and at last to Pencroft's great joy, no
less to his extreme surprise, he felt a tiny piece of wood
entangled in the lining of his waistcoat. He seized it with his
fingers through the stuff, but he could not get it out. If this was
a match and a single one, it was of great importance not to rub off
the phosphorus.
