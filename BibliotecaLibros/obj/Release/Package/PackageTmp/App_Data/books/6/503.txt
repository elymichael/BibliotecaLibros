"That may be," replied the sailor, "but I prefer a gale of wind
on board a well-found craft. A vessel is built to sail on the sea,
and not beneath it."

"My friends," said the engineer, "it is useless, at any rate as
regards the 'Nautilus,' to discuss the question of submarine
vessels. The 'Nautilus' is not ours, and we have not the right to
dispose of it. Moreover, we could in no case avail ourselves of it.
Independently of the fact that it would be impossible to get it out
of this cavern, whose entrance is now closed by the uprising of the
basaltic rocks, Captain Nemo's wish is that it shall be buried with
him. His wish is our law, and we will fulfil it."

After a somewhat prolonged conversation, Cyrus Harding and his
companions again descended to the interior of the "Nautilus." There
they took some refreshment and returned to the saloon.

Captain Nemo had somewhat rallied from the prostration which had
overcome him, and his eyes shone with their wonted fire. A faint
smile even curled his lips.

The colonists drew around him.

"Gentlemen," said the captain, "you are brave and honest men.
You have devoted yourselves to the common weal. Often have I
observed your conduct. I have esteemed you—I esteem you still! Your
hand, Mr. Harding."

Cyrus Harding gave his hand to the captain, who clasped it
affectionately.

"It is well!" he murmured.

He resumed,—

"But enough of myself. I have to speak concerning yourselves,
and this Lincoln Island, upon which you have taken refuge. You now
desire to leave it?"

"To return, captain!" answered Pencroft quickly.
