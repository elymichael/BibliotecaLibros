<br/>The engineer, with his telescope, could see that the four guns<br/>on board were pointed at the island. They were evidently ready to<br/>fire at a moment's notice.<br/><br/>In the meanwhile the "Speedy" remained silent. About thirty<br/>pirates could be seen moving on the deck. A few more on the poop;<br/>two others posted in the shrouds, and armed with spyglasses, were<br/>attentively surveying the island.<br/><br/>Certainly, Bob Harvey and his crew would not be able easily to<br/>give an account of what had happened during the night on board the<br/>brig. Had this half-naked man, who had forced the door of the<br/>powder-magazine, and with whom they had struggled, who had six<br/>times discharged his revolver at them, who had killed one and<br/>wounded two others, escaped their shot? Had he been able to swim to<br/>shore? Whence did he come? What had been his object? Had his design<br/>really been to blow up the brig, as Bob Harvey had thought? All<br/>this must be confused enough to the convicts' minds. But what they<br/>could no longer doubt was that the unknown island before which the<br/>"Speedy" had cast anchor was inhabited, and that there was,<br/>perhaps, a numerous colony ready to defend it. And yet no one was<br/>to be seen, neither on the shore, nor on the heights. The beach<br/>appeared to be absolutely deserted. At any rate, there was no trace<br/>of dwellings. Had the inhabitants fled into the interior? Thus<br/>probably the pirate captain reasoned, and doubtless, like a prudent<br/>man, he wished to reconnoiter the locality before he allowed his<br/>men to venture there.<br/><br/>During an hour and a half, no indication of attack or landing<br/>could be observed on board the brig. Evidently Bob Harvey was<br/>hesitating. Even with his strongest telescopes he could not have<br/>perceived one of the settlers crouched among the rocks. It was not<br/>even probable that his attention had been awakened by the screen of<br/>green branches and creepers hiding the windows of Granite House,<br/>and showing rather conspicuously on the bare rock. Indeed, how<br/>could he imagine that a dwelling was hollowed out, at that height,<br/>in the solid granite? From Claw Cape to the Mandible Capes, in all<br/>the extent of Union Bay, there was nothing to lead him to suppose<br/>that the island was or could be inhabited.<br/><br/>At eight o'clock, however, the colonists observed a movement on<br/>board the "Speedy." A boat was lowered, and seven men jumped into<br/>her. They were armed with muskets; one took the yoke-lines, four<br/>others the oars, and the two others, kneeling in the bows, ready to<br/>fire, reconnoitered the island. Their object was no doubt to make<br/>an examination but not to land, for in the latter case they would<br/>have come in larger numbers. The pirates from their look-out could<br/>have seen that the coast was sheltered by an islet, separated from<br/>it by a channel half a mile in width. However, it was soon evident<br/>to Cyrus Harding, on observing the direction followed by the boat,<br/>that they would not attempt to penetrate into the channel, but<br/>would land on the islet.<br/><br/>Pencroft and Ayrton, each hidden in a narrow cleft of the rock,<br/>saw them coming directly towards them, and waited till they were<br/>within range.<br/><br/>The boat advanced with extreme caution. The oars only dipped<br/>into the water at long intervals. It could now be seen that one of<br/>the convicts held a lead-line in his hand, and that he wished to<br/>fathom the depth of the channel hollowed out by the current of the<br/>Mercy. This showed that it was Bob Harvey's intention to bring his<br/>brig as near as possible to the coast. About thirty pirates,<br/>scattered in the rigging, followed every movement of the boat, and<br/>took the bearings of certain landmarks which would allow them to<br/>approach without danger. The boat was not more than two<br/>cables-lengths off the islet when she stopped. The man at the<br/>tiller stood up and looked for the best place at which to land.<br/><br/>At that moment two shots were heard. Smoke curled up from among<br/>the rocks of the islet. The man at the helm and the man with the<br/>lead-line fell backwards into the boat. Ayrton's and Pencroft's<br/>balls had struck them both at the same moment.<br/><br/>Almost immediately a louder report was heard, a cloud of smoke<br/>issued from the brig's side, and a ball, striking the summit of the<br/>rock which sheltered Ayrton and Pencroft, made it fly in splinters,<br/>but the two marksmen remained unhurt.<br/><br/>Horrible imprecations burst from the boat, which immediately<br/>continued its way. The man who had been at the tiller was replaced<br/>by one of his comrades, and the oars were rapidly plunged into the<br/>water. However, instead of returning on board as might have been<br/>expected, the boat coasted along the islet, so as to round its<br/>southern point. The pirates pulled vigorously at their oars that<br/>they might get out of range of the bullets.<br/><br/>
