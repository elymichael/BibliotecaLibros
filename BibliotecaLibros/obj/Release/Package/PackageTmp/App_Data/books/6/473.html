<br/>"And yet," added Pencroft, "the world is very learned. what a<br/>big book, captain, might be made with all that is known!"<br/><br/>"And what a much bigger book still with all that is not known!"<br/>answered Harding.<br/><br/>At last, for one reason or another, the month of June brought<br/>the cold with its accustomed intensity, and the settlers were often<br/>confined to Granite House. Ah! how wearisome this imprisonment was<br/>to them, and more particularly to Gideon Spilett.<br/><br/>"Look here," said he to Neb one day, "I would give you by<br/>notarial deed all the estates which will come to me some day, if<br/>you were a good enough fellow to go, no matter where, and subscribe<br/>to some newspaper for me! Decidedly the thing that is most<br/>essential to my happiness is the knowing every morning what has<br/>happened the day before in other places than this!"<br/><br/>Neb began to laugh.<br/><br/>"'Pon my word," he replied, "the only thing I think about is my<br/>daily work!"<br/><br/>The truth was that indoors as well as out there was no want of<br/>work.<br/><br/>The colony of Lincoln Island was now at its highest point of<br/>prosperity, achieved by three years of continued hard work. The<br/>destruction of the brig had been a new source of riches. Without<br/>speaking of the complete rig which would serve for the vessel now<br/>on the stocks, utensils and tools of all sorts, weapons and<br/>ammunition, clothes and instruments, were now piled in the<br/>storerooms of Granite House. It had not even been necessary to<br/>resort again to the manufacture of the coarse felt materials.<br/>Though the colonists had suffered from cold during their first<br/>winter, the bad season might now come without their having any<br/>reason to dread its severity. Linen was plentiful also, and<br/>besides, they kept it with extreme care. From chloride of sodium,<br/>which is nothing else than sea salt, Cyrus Harding easily extracted<br/>the soda and chlorine. The soda, which it was easy to change into<br/>carbonate of soda, and the chlorine, of which he made chloride of<br/>lime, were employed for various domestic purposes, and especially<br/>in bleaching linen. Besides, they did not wash more than four times<br/>a year, as was done by families in the olden times, and it may be<br/>added, that Pencroft and Gideon Spilett, while waiting for the<br/>postman to bring him his newspaper, distinguished themselves as<br/>washermen.<br/><br/>So passed the winter months, June, July, and August. They were<br/>severe, and the average observations of the thermometer did not<br/>give more than eight degrees of Fahrenheit. It was therefore lower<br/>in temperature than the preceding winter. But then, what splendid<br/>fires blazed continually on the hearths of Granite House, the smoke<br/>marking the granite wall with long, zebra-like streaks! Fuel was<br/>not spared, as it grew naturally a few steps from them. Besides,<br/>the chips of the wood destined for the construction of the ship<br/>enabled them to economize the coal, which required more trouble to<br/>transport.<br/><br/>Men and animals were all well. Master Jup was a little chilly,<br/>it must be confessed. This was perhaps his only weakness, and it<br/>was necessary to make him a well-padded dressing-gown. But what a<br/>servant he was, clever, zealous, indefatigable, not indiscreet, not<br/>talkative, and he might have been with reason proposed as a model<br/>for all his biped brothers in the Old and New Worlds!<br/><br/>
