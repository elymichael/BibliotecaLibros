<br/>"A steam machine?"<br/><br/>"No, a water machine."<br/><br/>And, indeed, to work his apparatus there was already a natural<br/>force at the disposal of the engineer which could be used without<br/>great difficulty. For this, it was enough to augment the flow of<br/>the little stream which supplied the interior of Granite House with<br/>water. The opening among the stones and grass was then increased,<br/>thus producing a strong fall at the bottom of the passage, the<br/>overflow from which escaped by the inner well. Below this fall the<br/>engineer fixed a cylinder with paddles, which was joined on the<br/>exterior with a strong cable rolled on a wheel, supporting a<br/>basket. In this way, by means of a long rope reaching to the<br/>ground, which enabled them to regulate the motive power, they could<br/>rise in the basket to the door of Granite House.<br/><br/>It was on the 17th of March that the lift acted for the first<br/>time, and gave universal satisfaction. Henceforward all the loads,<br/>wood, coal, provisions, and even the settlers themselves, were<br/>hoisted by this simple system, which replaced the primitive ladder,<br/>and, as may be supposed, no one thought of regretting the change.<br/>Top particularly was enchanted with this improvement, for he had<br/>not, and never could have possessed Master Jup's skill in climbing<br/>ladders, and often it was on Neb's back, or even on that of the<br/>orang that he had been obliged to make the ascent to Granite House.<br/>About this time, too, Cyrus Harding attempted to manufacture glass,<br/>and he at first put the old pottery-kiln to this new use. There<br/>were some difficulties to be encountered; but, after several<br/>fruitless attempts, he succeeded in setting up a glass manufactory,<br/>which Gideon Spilett and Herbert, his usual assistants, did not<br/>leave for several days. As to the substances used in the<br/>composition of glass, they are simply sand, chalk, and soda, either<br/>carbonate or sulphate. Now the beach supplied sand, lime supplied<br/>chalk, sea-weeds supplied soda, pyrites supplied sulphuric acid,<br/>and the ground supplied coal to heat the kiln to the wished-for<br/>temperature. Cyrus Harding thus soon had everything ready for<br/>setting to work.<br/><br/>The tool, the manufacture of which presented the most<br/>difficulty, was the pipe of the glass-maker, an iron tube, five or<br/>six feet long, which collects on one end the material in a state of<br/>fusion. But by means of a long, thin piece of iron rolled up like<br/>the barrel of a gun, Pencroft succeeded in making a tube soon ready<br/>for use.<br/><br/>On the 28th of March the tube was heated. A hundred parts of<br/>sand, thirty-five of chalk, forty of sulphate of soda, mixed with<br/>two or three parts of powdered coal, composed the substance, which<br/>was placed in crucibles. When the high temperature of the oven had<br/>reduced it to a liquid, or rather a pasty state, Cyrus Harding<br/>collected with the tube a quantity of the paste: he turned it about<br/>on a metal plate, previously arranged, so as to give it a form<br/>suitable for blowing, then he passed the tube to Herbert, telling<br/>him to blow at the other extremity.<br/><br/>And Herbert, swelling out his cheeks, blew so much and so well<br/>into the tube-taking care to twirl it round at the same timeâ€”that<br/>his breath dilated the glassy mass. Other quantities of the<br/>substance in a state of fusion were added to the first, and in a<br/>short time the result was a bubble which measured a foot in<br/>diameter. Harding then took the tube out of Herbert's hands, and,<br/>giving it a pendulous motion, he ended by lengthening the malleable<br/>bubble so as to give it a cylindroconic shape.<br/><br/>The blowing operation had given a cylinder of glass terminated<br/>by two hemispheric caps, which were easily detached by means of a<br/>sharp iron dipped in cold water; then, by the same proceeding, this<br/>cylinder was cut lengthways, and after having been rendered<br/>malleable by a second heating, it was extended on a plate and<br/>spread out with a wooden roller.<br/><br/>The first pane was thus manufactured, and they had only to<br/>perform this operation fifty times to have fifty panes. The windows<br/>at Granite House were soon furnished with panes; not very white,<br/>perhaps, but still sufficiently transparent.<br/><br/>As to bottles and tumblers, that was only play. They were<br/>satisfied with them, besides, just as they came from the end of the<br/>tube. Pencroft had asked to be allowed to "blow" in his turn, and<br/>it was great fun for him; but he blew so hard that his productions<br/>took the most ridiculous shapes, which he admired immensely.<br/><br/>
