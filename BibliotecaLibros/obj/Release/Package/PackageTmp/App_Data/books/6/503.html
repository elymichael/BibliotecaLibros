"That may be," replied the sailor, "but I prefer a gale of wind<br/>on board a well-found craft. A vessel is built to sail on the sea,<br/>and not beneath it."<br/><br/>"My friends," said the engineer, "it is useless, at any rate as<br/>regards the 'Nautilus,' to discuss the question of submarine<br/>vessels. The 'Nautilus' is not ours, and we have not the right to<br/>dispose of it. Moreover, we could in no case avail ourselves of it.<br/>Independently of the fact that it would be impossible to get it out<br/>of this cavern, whose entrance is now closed by the uprising of the<br/>basaltic rocks, Captain Nemo's wish is that it shall be buried with<br/>him. His wish is our law, and we will fulfil it."<br/><br/>After a somewhat prolonged conversation, Cyrus Harding and his<br/>companions again descended to the interior of the "Nautilus." There<br/>they took some refreshment and returned to the saloon.<br/><br/>Captain Nemo had somewhat rallied from the prostration which had<br/>overcome him, and his eyes shone with their wonted fire. A faint<br/>smile even curled his lips.<br/><br/>The colonists drew around him.<br/><br/>"Gentlemen," said the captain, "you are brave and honest men.<br/>You have devoted yourselves to the common weal. Often have I<br/>observed your conduct. I have esteemed you—I esteem you still! Your<br/>hand, Mr. Harding."<br/><br/>Cyrus Harding gave his hand to the captain, who clasped it<br/>affectionately.<br/><br/>"It is well!" he murmured.<br/><br/>He resumed,—<br/><br/>"But enough of myself. I have to speak concerning yourselves,<br/>and this Lincoln Island, upon which you have taken refuge. You now<br/>desire to leave it?"<br/><br/>"To return, captain!" answered Pencroft quickly.<br/>
