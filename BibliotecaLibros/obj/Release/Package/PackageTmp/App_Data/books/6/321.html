<br/>The stranger remained standing in a corner of the room, a little<br/>in the shade. He was bareheaded, his arms folded across his chest,<br/>and it was in this posture that in a hoarse voice, speaking like<br/>some one who obliges himself to speak, he gave the following<br/>recital, which his auditors did not once interrupt:—<br/><br/>"On the 20th of December, 1854, a steam-yacht, belonging to a<br/>Scotch nobleman, Lord Glenarvan, anchored off Cape Bernouilli, on<br/>the western coast of Australia, in the thirty-seventh parallel. On<br/>board this yacht were Lord Glenarvan and his wife, a major in the<br/>English army, a French geographer, a young girl, and a young boy.<br/>These two last were the children of Captain Grant, whose ship, the<br/>'Britannia,' had been lost, crew and cargo, a year before. The<br/>'Duncan' was commanded by Captain John Mangles, and manned by a<br/>crew of fifteen men.<br/><br/>"This is the reason the yacht at this time lay off the coast of<br/>Australia. Six months before, a bottle, enclosing a document<br/>written in English, German, and French, had been found in the Irish<br/>Sea, and picked up by the 'Duncan.' This document stated in<br/>substance that there still existed three survivors from the wreck<br/>of the 'Britannia,' that these survivors were Captain Grant and two<br/>of his men, and that they had found refuge on some land, of which<br/>the document gave the latitude, but of which the longitude, effaced<br/>by the sea, was no longer legible.<br/><br/>"This latitude was 37deg 11' south; therefore, the longitude<br/>being unknown, if they followed the thirty-seventh parallel over<br/>continents and seas, they would be certain to reach the spot<br/>inhabited by Captain Grant and his two companions. The English<br/>Admiralty having hesitated to undertake this search, Lord Glenarvan<br/>resolved to attempt everything to find the captain. He communicated<br/>with Mary and Robert Grant, who joined him. The 'Duncan' yacht was<br/>equipped for the distant voyage, in which the nobleman's family and<br/>the captain's children wished to take part, and the 'Duncan,'<br/>leaving Glasgow, proceeded towards the Atlantic, passed through the<br/>Straits of Magellan, and ascended the Pacific as far as Patagonia,<br/>where, according to a previous interpretation of the document, they<br/>supposed that Captain Grant was a prisoner among the Indians.<br/><br/>"The 'Duncan' disembarked her passengers on the western coast of<br/>Patagonia, and sailed to pick them up again on the eastern coast at<br/>Cape Corrientes. Lord Glenarvan traversed Patagonia, following the<br/>thirty- seventh parallel, and having found no trace of the captain,<br/>he re-embarked on the 13th of November, so as to pursue his search<br/>through the Ocean.<br/><br/>"After having unsuccessfully visited the islands of Tristan<br/>d'Acunha and Amsterdam, situated in her course, the 'Duncan,' as I<br/>have said, arrived at Cape Bernouilli, on the Australian coast, on<br/>the 20th of December, 1854.<br/><br/>"It was Lord Glenarvan's intention to traverse Australia as he<br/>had traversed America, and he disembarked. A few miles from the<br/>coast was established a farm, belonging to an Irishman, who offered<br/>hospitality to the travelers. Lord Glenarvan made known to the<br/>Irishman the cause which had brought him to these parts, and asked<br/>if he knew whether a three-masted English vessel, the 'Britannia,'<br/>had been lost less than two years before on the west coast of<br/>Australia.<br/><br/>"The Irishman had never heard of this wreck, but, to the great<br/>surprise of the bystanders, one of his servants came forward and<br/>said,—<br/><br/>"'My lord, praise and thank God! If Captain Grant is still<br/>living, he is living on the Australian shores.'<br/><br/>"'Who are you?' asked Lord Glenarvan.<br/><br/>
