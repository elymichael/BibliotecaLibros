"What do you mean?" asked the reporter.<br/><br/>"That we are not at the end of our trouble yet, my dear Spilett,<br/>and that his powerful intervention may have another opportunity of<br/>exercising itself. But that is not the question now. Herbert's life<br/>before everything."<br/><br/>This was the colonists' saddest thought. Several days passed,<br/>and the poor boy's state was happily no worse. Cold water, always<br/>kept at a suitable temperature, had completely prevented the<br/>inflammation of the wounds. It even seemed to the reporter that<br/>this water, being slightly sulphurous,—which was explained by the<br/>neighborhood of the volcano, had a more direct action on the<br/>healing. The suppuration was much less abundant, and thanks to the<br/>incessant care by which he was surrounded!—Herbert returned to<br/>life, and his fever abated. He was besides subjected to a severe<br/>diet, and consequently his weakness was and would be extreme; but<br/>there was no want of refreshing drinks, and absolute rest was of<br/>the greatest benefit to him. Cyrus Harding, Gideon Spilett, and<br/>Pencroft had become very skilful in dressing the lad's wounds. All<br/>the linen in the house had been sacrificed. Herbert's wounds,<br/>covered with compresses and lint, were pressed neither too much nor<br/>too little, so as to cause their cicatrization without effecting<br/>any inflammatory reaction. The reporter used extreme care in the<br/>dressing, knowing well the importance of it, and repeating to his<br/>companions that which most surgeons willingly admit, that it is<br/>perhaps rarer to see a dressing well done than an operation well<br/>performed.<br/><br/>In ten days, on the 22nd of November, Herbert was considerably<br/>better. He had begun to take some nourishment.<br/><br/>The color was returning to his cheeks, and his bright eyes<br/>smiled at his nurses. He talked a little, notwithstanding<br/>Pencroft's efforts, who talked incessantly to prevent him from<br/>beginning to speak, and told him the most improbable stories.<br/>Herbert had questioned him on the subject of Ayrton, whom he was<br/>astonished not to see near him, thinking that he was at the corral.<br/>But the sailor, not wishing to distress Herbert, contented himself<br/>by replying that Ayrton had rejoined Neb, so as to defend Granite<br/>House.<br/><br/>"Humph!" said Pencroft, "these pirates! they are gentlemen who<br/>have no right to any consideration! And the captain wanted to win<br/>them by kindness! I'll send them some kindness, but in the shape of<br/>a good bullet!"<br/><br/>"And have they not been seen again?" asked Herbert.<br/><br/>"No, my boy," answered the sailor, "but we shall find them, and<br/>when you are cured we shall see if the cowards who strike us from<br/>behind will dare to meet us face to face!"<br/><br/>"I am still very weak, my poor Pencroft!"<br/><br/>"Well! your strength will return gradually! What's a ball<br/>through the chest? Nothing but a joke! I've seen many, and I don't<br/>think much of them!"<br/><br/>At last things appeared to be going on well, and if no<br/>complication occurred, Herbert's recovery might be regarded as<br/>certain. But what would have been the condition of the colonists if<br/>his state had been aggravated, —if, for example, the ball had<br/>remained in his body, if his arm or his leg had had to be<br/>amputated?<br/>
