In the meanwhile, the stranger had not reappeared. Several times
Gideon Spilett and Herbert searched the forest in the neighborhood
of Granite House, without meeting or finding any trace of him. They
became seriously uneasy at this prolonged absence. Certainly, the
former savage of Tabor island could not be perplexed how to live in
the forest, abounding in game, but was it not to be feared that he
had resumed his habits, and that this freedom would revive in him
his wild instincts? However, Harding, by a sort of presentiment,
doubtless, always persisted in saying that the fugitive would
return.

"Yes, he will return!" he repeated with a confidence which his
companions could not share. "When this unfortunate man was on Tabor
Island, he knew himself to be alone! Here, he knows that fellow-men
are awaiting him! Since he has partially spoken of his past life,
the poor penitent will return to tell the whole, and from that day
he will belong to us!"

The event justified Cyrus Harding's predictions. On the 3rd of
December, Herbert had left the plateau to go and fish on the
southern bank of the lake. He was unarmed, and till then had never
taken any precautions for defense, as dangerous animals had not
shown themselves on that part of the island.

Meanwhile, Pencroft and Neb were working in the poultry-yard,
while Harding and the reporter were occupied at the Chimneys in
making soda, the store of soap being exhausted.

Suddenly cries resounded,â€”

"Help! help!"

Cyrus Harding and the reporter, being at too great a distance,
had not been able to hear the shouts. Pencroft and Neb, leaving the
poultry-yard in all haste, rushed towards the lake.

But before then, the stranger, whose presence at this place no
one had suspected, crossed Creek Glycerine, which separated the
plateau from the forest, and bounded up the opposite bank.

Herbert was there face to face with a fierce jaguar, similar to
the one which had been killed on Reptile End. Suddenly surprised,
he was standing with his back against a tree, while the animal
gathering itself together was about to spring.

But the stranger, with no other weapon than a knife, rushed on
the formidable animal, who turned to meet this new adversary.

The struggle was short. The stranger possessed immense strength
and activity. He seized the jaguar's throat with one powerful hand,
holding it as in a vise, without heeding the beast's claws which
tore his flesh, and with the other he plunged his knife into its
heart.
