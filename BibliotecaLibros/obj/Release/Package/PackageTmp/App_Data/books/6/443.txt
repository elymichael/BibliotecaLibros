Gideon Spilett took the box and opened it. It contained nearly
two hundred grains of a white powder, a few particles of which he
carried to his lips. The extreme bitterness of the substance
precluded all doubt; it was certainly the precious extract of
quinine, that pre-eminent antifebrile.

This powder must be administered to Herbert without delay. How
it came there might be discussed later.

"Some coffee!" said Spilett.

In a few moments Neb brought a cup of the warm infusion. Gideon
Spilett threw into it about eighteen grains of quinine, and they
succeeded in making Herbert drink the mixture.

There was still time, for the third attack of the malignant
fever had not yet shown itself. How they longed to be able to add
that it would not return!

Besides, it must be remarked, the hopes of all had now revived.
The mysterious influence had been again exerted, and in a critical
moment, when they had despaired of it.
