"And the great number of animals which still inhabit it," added<br/>Herbert.<br/><br/>"Yes, my boy," replied the engineer, "and you furnish me with an<br/>argument to support my theory. It is certain, after what we have<br/>seen, that animals are numerous in this island, and what is more<br/>strange, that the species are extremely varied. There is a reason<br/>for that, and to me it is that Lincoln Island may have formerly<br/>been a part of some vast continent which had gradually sunk below<br/>the Pacific."<br/><br/>"Then, some fine day," said Pencroft, who did not appear to be<br/>entirely convinced, "the rest of this ancient continent may<br/>disappear in its turn, and there will be nothing between America<br/>and Asia."<br/><br/>"Yes," replied Harding, "there will be new continents which<br/>millions and millions of animalculae are building at this<br/>moment."<br/><br/>"And what are these masons?" asked Pencroft.<br/><br/>"Coral insects," replied Cyrus Harding. "By constant work they<br/>made the island of Clermont-Tonnerre, and numerous other coral<br/>islands in the Pacific Ocean. Forty-seven millions of these insects<br/>are needed to weigh a grain, and yet, with the sea-salt they<br/>absorb, the solid elements of water which they assimilate, these<br/>animalculae produce limestone, and this limestone forms enormous<br/>submarine erections, of which the hardness and solidity equal<br/>granite. Formerly, at the first periods of creation, nature<br/>employing fire, heaved up the land, but now she entrusts to these<br/>microscopic creatures the task of replacing this agent, of which<br/>the dynamic power in the interior of the globe has evidently<br/>diminishedâ€”which is proved by the number of volcanoes on the<br/>surface of the earth, now actually extinct. And I believe that<br/>centuries succeeding to centuries, and insects to insects, this<br/>Pacific may one day be changed into a vast continent, which new<br/>generations will inhabit and civilize in their turn."<br/><br/>"That will take a long time," said Pencroft.<br/><br/>"Nature has time for it," replied the engineer.<br/><br/>"But what would be the use of new continents?" asked Herbert.<br/>"It appears to me that the present extent of habitable countries is<br/>sufficient for humanity. Yet nature does nothing uselessly."<br/><br/>"Nothing uselessly, certainly," replied the engineer, "but this<br/>is how the necessity of new continents for the future, and exactly<br/>on the tropical zone occupied by the coral islands, may be<br/>explained. At least to me this explanation appears plausible."<br/><br/>"We are listening, captain," said Herbert.<br/>
