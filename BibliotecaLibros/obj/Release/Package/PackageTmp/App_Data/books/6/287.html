<br/>But no voice was heard, the door did not open. The hours thus<br/>passed away.<br/><br/>How long the night appeared to the sailor and his companions!<br/>Herbert alone slept for two hours, for at his age sleep is a<br/>necessity. They were all three anxious to continue their<br/>exploration of the day before, and to search the most secret<br/>recesses of the islet! The inferences deduced by Pencroft were<br/>perfectly reasonable, and it was nearly certain that, as the hut<br/>was deserted, and the tools, utensils, and weapons were still<br/>there, the owner had succumbed. It was agreed, therefore, that they<br/>should search for his remains, and give them at least Christian<br/>burial.<br/><br/>Day dawned; Pencroft and his companions immediately proceeded to<br/>survey the dwelling. It had certainly been built in a favorable<br/>situation, at the back of a little hill, sheltered by five or six<br/>magnificent gum-trees. Before its front and through the trees the<br/>axe had prepared a wide clearing, which allowed the view to extend<br/>to the sea. Beyond a lawn, surrounded by a wooden fence falling to<br/>pieces, was the shore, on the left of which was the mouth of the<br/>stream.<br/><br/>The hut had been built of planks, and it was easy to see that<br/>these planks had been obtained from the hull or deck of a ship. It<br/>was probable that a disabled vessel had been cast on the coast of<br/>the island, that one at least of the crew had been saved, and that<br/>by means of the wreck this man, having tools at his disposal, had<br/>built the dwelling.<br/><br/>And this became still more evident when Gideon Spilett, after<br/>having walked around the hut, saw on a plank, probably one of those<br/>which had formed the armor of the wrecked vessel, these letters<br/>already half effaced:<br/><br/>BR—TAN—A<br/><br/>"Britannia," exclaimed Pencroft, whom the reporter had called;<br/>"it is a common name for ships, and I could not say if she was<br/>English or American!"<br/><br/>"It matters very little, Pencroft!"<br/><br/>"Very little indeed," answered the sailor, "and we will save the<br/>survivor of her crew if he is still living, to whatever country he<br/>may belong. But before beginning our search again let us go on<br/>board the 'Bonadventure'."<br/><br/>A sort of uneasiness had seized Pencroft upon the subject of his<br/>vessel. Should the island be inhabited after all, and should some<br/>one have taken possession of her? But he shrugged his shoulders at<br/>such an unreasonable supposition. At any rate the sailor was not<br/>sorry to go to breakfast on board. The road already trodden was not<br/>long, scarcely a mile. They set out on their walk, gazing into the<br/>wood and thickets through which goats and pigs fled in<br/>hundreds.<br/><br/>
