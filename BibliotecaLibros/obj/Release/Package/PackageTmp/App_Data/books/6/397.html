<br/>"Captain Harding," replied Ayrton, "I can give you no better<br/>advice in this matter. Whatever you do will be best; when you wish<br/>me to join you in your researches, I am ready to follow you.<br/><br/>"I thank you, Ayrton," answered Cyrus Harding, "but I should<br/>like a more direct answer to the question I put to you. You are our<br/>companion; you have already endangered your life several times for<br/>us, and you, as well as the rest, ought to be consulted in the<br/>matter of any important decision. Speak, therefore."<br/><br/>"Captain Harding," replied Ayrton, "I think that we ought to do<br/>everything to discover this unknown benefactor. Perhaps he is<br/>alone. Perhaps he is suffering. Perhaps he has a life to be<br/>renewed. I, too, as you said, have a debt of gratitude to pay him.<br/>It was he, it could be only he who must have come to Tabor Island,<br/>who found there the wretch you knew, and who made known to you that<br/>there was an unfortunate man there to be saved. Therefore it is,<br/>thanks to him, that I have become a man again. No, I will never<br/>forget him!"<br/><br/>"That is settled, then," said Cyrus Harding. "We will begin our<br/>researches as soon as possible. We will not leave a corner of the<br/>island unexplored. We will search into its most secret recesses,<br/>and will hope that our unknown friend will pardon us in<br/>consideration of our intentions!"<br/><br/>For several days the colonists were actively employed in<br/>haymaking and the harvest. Before putting their project of<br/>exploring the yet unknown parts of the island into execution, they<br/>wished to get all possible work finished. It was also the time for<br/>collecting the various vegetables from the Tabor Island plants. All<br/>was stowed away, and happily there was no want of room in Granite<br/>House, in which they might have housed all the treasures of the<br/>island. The products of the colony were there, methodically<br/>arranged, and in a safe place, as may be believed, sheltered as<br/>much from animals as from man.<br/><br/>There was no fear of damp in the middle of that thick mass of<br/>granite. Many natural excavations situated in the upper passage<br/>were enlarged either by pick-axe or mine, and Granite House thus<br/>became a general warehouse, containing all the provisions, arms,<br/>tools, and spare utensilsâ€”in a word, all the stores of the<br/>colony.<br/><br/>As to the guns obtained from the brig, they were pretty pieces<br/>of ordnance, which, at Pencroft's entreaty, were hoisted by means<br/>of tackle and pulleys, right up into Granite House; embrasures were<br/>made between the windows, and the shining muzzles of the guns could<br/>soon be seen through the granite cliff. From this height they<br/>commanded all Union Bay. It was like a little Gibraltar, and any<br/>vessel anchored off the islet would inevitably be exposed to the<br/>fire of this aerial battery.<br/><br/>"Captain," said Pencroft one day, it was the 8th of November,<br/>"now that our fortifications are finished, it would be a good thing<br/>if we tried the range of our guns."<br/><br/>"Do you think that is useful?" asked the engineer.<br/><br/>"It is more than useful, it is necessary! Without that how are<br/>we to know to what distance we can send one of those pretty shot<br/>with which we are provided?"<br/><br/>
