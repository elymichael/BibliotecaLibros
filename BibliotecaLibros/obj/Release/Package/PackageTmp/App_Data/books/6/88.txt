"Smoke," replied Herbert. "We have seen smoke among the rocks, a
hundred paces from us."

"Men in this place?" cried the reporter.

"We must avoid showing ourselves before knowing with whom we
have to deal," replied Cyrus Harding. "I trust that there are no
natives on this island; I dread them more than anything else. Where
is Top?"

"Top is on before."

"And he doesn't bark?"

"No."

"That is strange. However, we must try to call him back."

In a few moments, the engineer, Gideon Spilett, and Herbert had
rejoined their two companions, and like them, they kept out of
sight behind the heaps of basalt.

From thence they clearly saw smoke of a yellowish color rising
in the air.
