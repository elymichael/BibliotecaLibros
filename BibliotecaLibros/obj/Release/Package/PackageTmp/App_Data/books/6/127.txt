They then left the transformation to complete itself, and it
would not take less than ten or twelve days for the sulphuret of
iron to be changed to sulphate of iron and the alumina into
sulphate of alumina, two equally soluble substances, the others,
flint, burnt coal, and cinders, not being so.

While this chemical work was going on, Cyrus Harding proceeded
with other operations, which were pursued with more than zeal,—it
was eagerness.

Neb and Pencroft had taken away the fat from the dugong, and
placed it in large earthen pots. It was then necessary to separate
the glycerine from the fat by saponifying it. Now, to obtain this
result, it had to be treated either with soda or lime. In fact, one
or other of these substances, after having attacked the fat, would
form a soap by separating the glycerine, and it was just this
glycerine which the engineer wished to obtain. There was no want of
lime, only treatment by lime would give calcareous soap, insoluble,
and consequently useless, while treatment by soda would furnish, on
the contrary, a soluble soap, which could be put to domestic use.
Now, a practical man, like Cyrus Harding, would rather try to
obtain soda. Was this difficult? No; for marine plants abounded on
the shore, glass-wort, ficoides, and all those fucaceae which form
wrack. A large quantity of these plants was collected, first dried,
then burnt in holes in the open air. The combustion of these plants
was kept up for several days, and the result was a compact gray
mass, which has been long known under the name of "natural
soda."

This obtained, the engineer treated the fat with soda, which
gave both a soluble soap and that neutral substance, glycerine.

But this was not all. Cyrus Harding still needed, in view of his
future preparation, another substance, nitrate of potash, which is
better known under the name of salt niter, or of saltpeter.

Cyrus Harding could have manufactured this substance by treating
the carbonate of potash, which would be easily extracted from the
cinders of the vegetables, by azotic acid. But this acid was
wanting, and he would have been in some difficulty, if nature had
not happily furnished the saltpeter, without giving them any other
trouble than that of picking it up. Herbert found a vein of it at
the foot of Mount Franklin, and they had nothing to do but purify
this salt.

These different works lasted a week. They were finished before
the transformation of the sulphuret into sulphate of iron had been
accomplished. During the following days the settlers had time to
construct a furnace of bricks of a particular arrangement, to serve
for the distillation of the sulphate or iron when it had been
obtained. All this was finished about the 18th of May, nearly at
the time when the chemical transformation terminated. Gideon
Spilett, Herbert, Neb, and Pencroft, skillfully directed by the
engineer, had become most clever workmen. Before all masters,
necessity is the one most listened to, and who teaches the
best.

When the heap of pyrites had been entirely reduced by fire, the
result of the operation, consisting of sulphate of iron, sulphate
of alumina, flint, remains of coal, and cinders was placed in a
basinful of water. They stirred this mixture, let it settle, then
decanted it, and obtained a clear liquid containing in solution
sulphate of iron and sulphate of alumina, the other matters
remaining solid, since they are insoluble. Lastly, this liquid
being partly evaporated, crystals of sulphate of iron were
deposited, and the not evaporated liquid, which contained the
sulphate of alumina, was thrown away.

Cyrus Harding had now at his disposal a large quantity of these
sulphate of iron crystals, from which the sulphuric acid had to be
extracted. The making of sulphuric acid is a very expensive
manufacture. Considerable works are necessary—a special set of
tools, an apparatus of platina, leaden chambers, unassailable by
the acid, and in which the transformation is performed, etc. The
engineer had none of these at his disposal, but he knew that, in
Bohemia especially, sulphuric acid is manufactured by very simple
means, which have also the advantage of producing it to a superior
degree of concentration. It is thus that the acid known under the
name of Nordhausen acid is made.

To obtain sulphuric acid, Cyrus Harding had only one operation
to make, to calcine the sulphate of iron crystals in a closed vase,
so that the sulphuric acid should distil in vapor, which vapor, by
condensation, would produce the acid.
