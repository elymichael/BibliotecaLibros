"Indeed," remarked the reporter, "it will be important to take a
document there which will make known the situation of Lincoln
Island, and Ayrton's new residence, in case the Scotch yacht
returns to fetch him."

"Well, the 'Bonadventure' is always there, Mr. Spilett,"
answered the sailor. "She and her crew are ready to start at a
moment's notice!"

"I think, Pencroft, that that is a thing to be done after our
exploration of the island is finished. It is possible after all
that the stranger, if we manage to find him, may know as much about
Tabor Island as about Lincoln Island. Do not forget that he is
certainly the author of the document, and he may, perhaps, know how
far we may count on the return of the yacht!"

"But!" exclaimed Pencroft, "who in the world can he be? The
fellow knows us and we know nothing about him! If he is a simple
castaway, why should he conceal himself! We are honest men, I
suppose, and the society of honest men isn't unpleasant to any one.
Did he come here voluntarily? Can he leave the island if he likes?
Is he here still? Will he remain any longer?"

Chatting thus, Pencroft, Gideon Spilett, and Herbert got on
board and looked about the deck of the "Bonadventure." All at once,
the sailor having examined the bitts to which the cable of the
anchor was secured,â€”

"Hallo," he cried, "this is queer!"

"What is the matter, Pencroft?" asked the reporter.

"The matter is, that it was not I who made this knot!"

And Pencroft showed a rope which fastened the cable to the bitt
itself.

"What, it was not you?" asked Gideon Spilett.
