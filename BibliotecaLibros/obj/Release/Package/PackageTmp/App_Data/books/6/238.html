"With good old Jup there is never any quarreling," often<br/>repeated Pencroft, "never any improper reply. What a servant, Neb,<br/>what a servant!"<br/><br/>Of course Jup was now well used to service. He brushed their<br/>clothes, he turned the spit, he waited at table, he swept the<br/>rooms, he gathered wood, and he performed another admirable piece<br/>of service which delighted Pencroftâ€”he never went to sleep without<br/>first coming to tuck up the worthy sailor in his bed.<br/><br/>As to the health of the members of the colony, bipeds or bimana,<br/>quadrumana or quadrupeds, it left nothing to be desired. With their<br/>life in the open air, on this salubrious soil, under that temperate<br/>zone, working both with head and hands, they could not suppose that<br/>illness would ever attack them.<br/><br/>All were indeed wonderfully well. Herbert had already grown two<br/>inches in the year. His figure was forming and becoming more manly,<br/>and he promised to be an accomplished man, physically as well as<br/>morally. Besides he improved himself during the leisure hours which<br/>manual occupations left to him; he read the books found in the<br/>case; and after the practical lessons which were taught by the very<br/>necessity of their position, he found in the engineer for science,<br/>and the reporter for languages, masters who were delighted to<br/>complete his education.<br/><br/>The tempest ended about the 9th of March, but the sky remained<br/>covered with clouds during the whole of this last summer month. The<br/>atmosphere, violently agitated by the electric commotions, could<br/>not recover its former purity, and there was almost invariably rain<br/>and fog, except for three or four fine days on which several<br/>excursions were made. About this time the female onager gave birth<br/>to a young one which belonged to the same sex as its mother, and<br/>which throve capitally. In the corral, the flock of musmons had<br/>also increased, and several lambs already bleated in the sheds, to<br/>the great delight of Neb and Herbert, who had each their favorite<br/>among these newcomers. An attempt was also made for the<br/>domestication of the peccaries, which succeeded well. A sty was<br/>constructed under the poultry-yard, and soon contained several<br/>young ones in the way to become civilized, that is to say, to<br/>become fat under Neb's care. Master Jup, entrusted with carrying<br/>them their daily nourishment, leavings from the kitchen, etc.,<br/>acquitted himself conscientiously of his task. He sometimes amused<br/>himself at the expense of his little pensioners by tweaking their<br/>tails; but this was mischief, and not wickedness, for these little<br/>twisted tails amused him like a plaything, and his instinct was<br/>that of a child. One day in this month of March, Pencroft, talking<br/>to the engineer, reminded Cyrus Harding of a promise which the<br/>latter had not as yet had time to fulfil.<br/><br/>"You once spoke of an apparatus which would take the place of<br/>the long ladders at Granite House, captain," said he; "won't you<br/>make it some day?"<br/><br/>"Nothing will be easier; but is this a really useful thing?"<br/><br/>"Certainly, captain. After we have given ourselves necessaries,<br/>let us think a little of luxury. For us it may be luxury, if you<br/>like, but for things it is necessary. It isn't very convenient to<br/>climb up a long ladder when one is heavily loaded."<br/><br/>"Well, Pencroft, we will try to please you," replied Cyrus<br/>Harding.<br/><br/>"But you have no machine at your disposal."<br/><br/>"We will make one."<br/>
