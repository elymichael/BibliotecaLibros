<br/>The animals, motionless among the blocks of basalt, gazed with<br/>an astonished eye, as if they saw human bipeds for the first time.<br/>Then their fears suddenly aroused, they disappeared, bounding over<br/>the rocks.<br/><br/>"Good-bye, till we meet again," cried Pencroft, as he watched<br/>them, in such a comical tone that Cyrus Harding, Gideon Spilett,<br/>Herbert, and Neb could not help laughing.<br/><br/>The ascent was continued. Here and there were traces of lava.<br/>Sulphur springs sometimes stopped their way, and they had to go<br/>round them. In some places the sulphur had formed crystals among<br/>other substances, such as whitish cinders made of an infinity of<br/>little feldspar crystals.<br/><br/>In approaching the first plateau formed by the truncating of the<br/>lower cone, the difficulties of the ascent were very great. Towards<br/>four o'clock the extreme zone of the trees had been passed. There<br/>only remained here and there a few twisted, stunted pines, which<br/>must have had a hard life in resisting at this altitude the high<br/>winds from the open sea. Happily for the engineer and his<br/>companions the weather was beautiful, the atmosphere tranquil; for<br/>a high breeze at an elevation of three thousand feet would have<br/>hindered their proceedings. The purity of the sky at the zenith was<br/>felt through the transparent air. A perfect calm reigned around<br/>them. They could not see the sun, then hid by the vast screen of<br/>the upper cone, which masked the half-horizon of the west, and<br/>whose enormous shadow stretching to the shore increased as the<br/>radiant luminary sank in its diurnal course. Vapor—mist rather than<br/>clouds—began to appear in the east, and assume all the prismatic<br/>colors under the influence of the solar rays.<br/><br/>Five hundred feet only separated the explorers from the plateau,<br/>which they wished to reach so as to establish there an encampment<br/>for the night, but these five hundred feet were increased to more<br/>than two miles by the zigzags which they had to describe. The soil,<br/>as it were, slid under their feet.<br/><br/>The slope often presented such an angle that they slipped when<br/>the stones worn by the air did not give a sufficient support.<br/>Evening came on by degrees, and it was almost night when Cyrus<br/>Harding and his companions, much fatigued by an ascent of seven<br/>hours, arrived at the plateau of the first cone. It was then<br/>necessary to prepare an encampment, and to restore their strength<br/>by eating first and sleeping afterwards. This second stage of the<br/>mountain rose on a base of rocks, among which it would be easy to<br/>find a retreat. Fuel was not abundant. However, a fire could be<br/>made by means of the moss and dry brushwood, which covered certain<br/>parts of the plateau. While the sailor was preparing his hearth<br/>with stones which he put to this use, Neb and Herbert occupied<br/>themselves with getting a supply of fuel. They soon returned with a<br/>load of brushwood. The steel was struck, the burnt linen caught the<br/>sparks of flint, and, under Neb's breath, a crackling fire showed<br/>itself in a few minutes under the shelter of the rocks. Their<br/>object in lighting a fire was only to enable them to withstand the<br/>cold temperature of the night, as it was not employed in cooking<br/>the bird, which Neb kept for the next day. The remains of the<br/>capybara and some dozens of the stone-pine almonds formed their<br/>supper. It was not half-past six when all was finished.<br/><br/>Cyrus Harding then thought of exploring in the half-light the<br/>large circular layer which supported the upper cone of the<br/>mountain. Before taking any rest, he wished to know if it was<br/>possible to get round the base of the cone in the case of its sides<br/>being too steep and its summit being inaccessible. This question<br/>preoccupied him, for it was possible that from the way the hat<br/>inclined, that is to say, towards the north, the plateau was not<br/>practicable. Also, if the summit of the mountain could not be<br/>reached on one side, and if, on the other, they could not get round<br/>the base of the cone, it would be impossible to survey the western<br/>part of the country, and their object in making the ascent would in<br/>part be altogether unattained.<br/><br/>The engineer, accordingly, regardless of fatigue, leaving<br/>Pencroft and Neb to arrange the beds, and Gideon Spilett to note<br/>the incidents of the day, began to follow the edge of the plateau,<br/>going towards the north. Herbert accompanied him.<br/><br/>The night was beautiful and still, the darkness was not yet<br/>deep. Cyrus Harding and the boy walked near each other, without<br/>speaking. In some places the plateau opened before them, and they<br/>passed without hindrance. In others, obstructed by rocks, there was<br/>only a narrow path, in which two persons could not walk abreast.<br/>After a walk of twenty minutes, Cyrus Harding and Herbert were<br/>obliged to stop. From this point the slope of the two cones became<br/>one. No shoulder here separated the two parts of the mountain. The<br/>slope, being inclined almost seventy degrees, the path became<br/>impracticable.<br/><br/>But if the engineer and the boy were obliged to give up thoughts<br/>of following a circular direction, in return an opportunity was<br/>given for ascending the cone.<br/><br/>
