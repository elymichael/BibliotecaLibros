"No one," replied Pencroft.

"It is a long time since this room has been inhabited," observed
Herbert.

"Yes, a very long time!" answered the reporter.

"Mr. Spilett," then said Pencroft, "instead of returning on
board, I think that it would be well to pass the night in this
hut."

"You are right, Pencroft," answered Gideon Spilett, "and if its
owner returns, well! perhaps he will not be sorry to find the place
taken possession of."

"He will not return," said the sailor, shaking his head.

"You think that he has quitted the island?" asked the
reporter.

"If he had quitted the island he would have taken away his
weapons and his tools," replied Pencroft. "You know the value which
castaways set on such articles as these the last remains of a
wreck. No! no!" repeated the sailor, in a tone of conviction; "no,
he has not left the island! If he had escaped in a boat made by
himself, he would still less have left these indispensable and
necessary articles. No! he is on the island!"

"Living?" asked Herbert.

"Living or dead. But if he is dead, I suppose he has not buried
himself, and so we shall at least find his remains!"

It was then agreed that the night should be passed in the
deserted dwelling, and a store of wood found in a corner was
sufficient to warm it. The door closed, Pencroft, Herbert and
Spilett remained there, seated on a bench, talking little but
wondering much. They were in a frame of mind to imagine anything or
expect anything. They listened eagerly for sounds outside. The door
might have opened suddenly, and a man presented himself to them
without their being in the least surprised, notwithstanding all
that the hut revealed of abandonment, and they had their hands
ready to press the hands of this man, this castaway, this unknown
friend, for whom friends were waiting.
