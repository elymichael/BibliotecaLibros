"Pooh!"<br/><br/>"Nor any means of relighting it!"<br/><br/>"Nonsense!"<br/><br/>"But I say, Mr. Spilett—"<br/><br/>"Isn't Cyrus here?" replied the reporter.<br/><br/>"Is not our engineer alive? He will soon find some way of making<br/>fire for us!"<br/><br/>"With what?"<br/><br/>"With nothing."<br/><br/>What had Pencroft to say? He could say nothing, for, in the<br/>bottom of his heart he shared the confidence which his companions<br/>had in Cyrus Harding. The engineer was to them a microcosm, a<br/>compound of every science, a possessor of all human knowledge. It<br/>was better to be with Cyrus in a desert island, than without him in<br/>the most flourishing town in the United States. With him they could<br/>want nothing; with him they would never despair. If these brave men<br/>had been told that a volcanic eruption would destroy the land, that<br/>this land would be engulfed in the depths of the Pacific, they<br/>would have imperturbably replied,—<br/><br/>"Cyrus is here!"<br/><br/>While in the palanquin, however, the engineer had again relapsed<br/>into unconsciousness, which the jolting to which he had been<br/>subjected during his journey had brought on, so that they could not<br/>now appeal to his ingenuity. The supper must necessarily be very<br/>meager. In fact, all the grouse flesh had been consumed, and there<br/>no longer existed any means of cooking more game. Besides, the<br/>couroucous which had been reserved had disappeared. They must<br/>consider what was to be done.<br/>
