"Do you hope, then, Pencroft, that the villains have spared
him?" asked Gideon Spilett.

"Yes, if they had any interest in doing so."

"What! you suppose that Ayrton finding his old companions,
forgetting all that he owes us—"

"Who knows?" answered the sailor, who did not hazard this
shameful supposition without hesitating.

"Pencroft," said Harding, taking the sailor's arm, "that is a
wicked idea of yours, and you will distress me much if you persist
in speaking thus. I will answer for Ayrton's fidelity."

"And I also," added the reporter quickly.

"Yes, yes, captain, I was wrong," replied Pencroft; "it was a
wicked idea indeed that I had, and nothing justifies it. But what
can I do? I'm not in my senses. This imprisonment in the corral
wearies me horribly, and I have never felt so excited as I do
now.

"Be patient, Pencroft," replied the engineer. "How long will it
be, my dear Spilett, before you think Herbert may be carried to
Granite House?"

"That is difficult to say, Cyrus," answered the reporter, "for
any imprudence might involve terrible consequences. But his
convalescence is progressing, and if he continues to gain strength,
in eight days from now— well, we shall see."

Eight days! That would put off the return to Granite House until
the first days of December. At this time two months of spring had
already passed. The weather was fine, and the heat began to be
great. The forests of the island were in full leaf, and the time
was approaching when the usual crops ought to be gathered. The
return to the plateau of Prospect Heights would, therefore, be
followed by extensive agricultural labors, interrupted only by the
projected expedition through the island.
