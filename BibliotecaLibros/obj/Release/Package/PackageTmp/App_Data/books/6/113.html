The sailor and the Negro cleverly performed the operation, and<br/>three hours afterwards Cyrus Harding had at his disposal two seals'<br/>skins, which he intended to use in this state, without subjecting<br/>them to any tanning process.<br/><br/>The settlers waited till the tide was again low, and crossing<br/>the channel they entered the Chimneys.<br/><br/>The skins had then to be stretched on a frame of wood and sewn<br/>by means of fibers so as to preserve the air without allowing too<br/>much to escape. Cyrus Harding had nothing but the two steel blades<br/>from Top's collar, and yet he was so clever, and his companions<br/>aided him with so much intelligence, that three days afterwards the<br/>little colony's stock of tools was augmented by a blowing-machine,<br/>destined to inject the air into the midst of the ore when it should<br/>be subjected to heatâ€”an indispensable condition to the success of<br/>the operation.<br/><br/>On the morning of the 20th of April began the "metallic period,"<br/>as the reporter called it in his notes. The engineer had decided,<br/>as has been said, to operate near the veins both of coal and ore.<br/>Now, according to his observations, these veins were situated at<br/>the foot of the northeast spurs of Mount Franklin, that is to say,<br/>a distance of six miles from their home. It was impossible,<br/>therefore, to return every day to the Chimneys, and it was agreed<br/>that the little colony should camp under a hut of branches, so that<br/>the important operation could be followed night and day.<br/><br/>This settled, they set out in the morning. Neb and Pencroft<br/>dragged the bellows on a hurdle; also a quantity of vegetables and<br/>animals, which they besides could renew on the way.<br/><br/>The road led through Jacamar Wood, which they traversed<br/>obliquely from southeast to northwest, and in the thickest part. It<br/>was necessary to beat a path, which would in the future form the<br/>most direct road to Prospect Heights and Mount Franklin. The trees,<br/>belonging to the species already discovered, were magnificent.<br/>Herbert found some new ones, among others some which Pencroft<br/>called "sham leeks"; for, in spite of their size, they were of the<br/>same liliaceous family as the onion, chive, shallot, or asparagus.<br/>These trees produce ligneous roots which, when cooked, are<br/>excellent; from them, by fermentation, a very agreeable liquor is<br/>made. They therefore made a good store of the roots.<br/><br/>The journey through the wood was long; it lasted the whole day,<br/>and so allowed plenty of time for examining the flora and fauna.<br/>Top, who took special charge of the fauna, ran through the grass<br/>and brushwood, putting up all sorts of game. Herbert and Gideon<br/>Spilett killed two kangaroos with bows and arrows, and also an<br/>animal which strongly resembled both a hedgehog and an ant-eater.<br/>It was like the first because it rolled itself into a ball, and<br/>bristled with spines, and the second because it had sharp claws, a<br/>long slender snout which terminated in a bird's beak, and an<br/>extendible tongue, covered with little thorns which served to hold<br/>the insects.<br/><br/>"And when it is in the pot," asked Pencroft naturally, "what<br/>will it be like?"<br/><br/>"An excellent piece of beef," replied Herbert.<br/><br/>"We will not ask more from it," replied the sailor,<br/><br/>During this excursion they saw several wild boars, which<br/>however, did not offer to attack the little band, and it appeared<br/>as if they would not meet with any dangerous beasts; when, in a<br/>thick part of the wood, the reporter thought he saw, some paces<br/>from him, among the lower branches of a tree, an animal which he<br/>took for a bear, and which he very tranquilly began to draw.<br/>Happily for Gideon Spilett, the animal in question did not belong<br/>to the redoubtable family of the plantigrades. It was only a koala,<br/>better known under the name of the sloth, being about the size of a<br/>large dog, and having stiff hair of a dirty color, the paws armed<br/>with strong claws, which enabled it to climb trees and feed on the<br/>leaves. Having identified the animal, which they did not disturb,<br/>Gideon Spilett erased "bear" from the title of his sketch, putting<br/>koala in its place, and the journey was resumed.<br/>
