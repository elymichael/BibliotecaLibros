<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>19<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>The next day, the 22nd of May, the arrangement of their new<br/>dwelling was commenced. In fact, the settlers longed to exchange<br/>the insufficient shelter of the Chimneys for this large and healthy<br/>retreat, in the midst of solid rock, and sheltered from the water<br/>both of the sea and sky. Their former dwelling was not, however, to<br/>be entirely abandoned, for the engineer intended to make a<br/>manufactory of it for important works. Cyrus Harding's first care<br/>was to find out the position of the front of Granite House from the<br/>outside. He went to the beach, and as the pickaxe when it escaped<br/>from the hands of the reporter must have fallen perpendicularly to<br/>the foot of the cliff, the finding it would be sufficient to show<br/>the place where the hole had been pierced in the granite.<br/><br/>The pickaxe was easily found, and the hole could be seen in a<br/>perpendicular line above the spot where it was stuck in the sand.<br/>Some rock pigeons were already flying in and out of the narrow<br/>opening; they evidently thought that Granite House had been<br/>discovered on purpose for them. It was the engineer's intention to<br/>divide the right portion of the cavern into several rooms, preceded<br/>by an entrance passage, and to light it by means of five windows<br/>and a door, pierced in the front. Pencroft was much pleased with<br/>the five windows, but he could not understand the use of the door,<br/>since the passage offered a natural staircase, through which it<br/>would always be easy to enter Granite House.<br/><br/>"My friend," replied Harding, "if it is easy for us to reach our<br/>dwelling by this passage, it will be equally easy for others<br/>besides us. I mean, on the contrary, to block up that opening, to<br/>seal it hermetically, and, if it is necessary, to completely hide<br/>the entrance by making a dam, and thus causing the water of the<br/>lake to rise."<br/><br/>"And how shall we get in?" asked the sailor.<br/><br/>"By an outside ladder," replied Cyrus Harding, "a rope ladder,<br/>which, once drawn up, will render access to our dwelling<br/>impossible."<br/><br/>"But why so many precautions?" asked Pencroft. "As yet we have<br/>seen no dangerous animals. As to our island being inhabited by<br/>natives, I don't believe it!"<br/><br/>
