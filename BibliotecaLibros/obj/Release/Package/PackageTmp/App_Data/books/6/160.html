<br/>"Why?"<br/><br/>"Because that pleases me!"<br/><br/>"Are you very fond of pig then, Pencroft?"<br/><br/>"I am very fond of pig," replied the sailor, "particularly of<br/>its feet, and if it had eight instead of four, I should like it<br/>twice as much!"<br/><br/>As to the animals in question, they were peccaries belonging to<br/>one of the four species which are included in the family, and they<br/>were also of the species of Tajacu, recognizable by their deep<br/>color and the absence of those long teeth with which the mouths of<br/>their congeners are armed. These peccaries generally live in herds,<br/>and it was probable that they abounded in the woody parts of the<br/>island.<br/><br/>At any rate, they were eatable from head to foot, and Pencroft<br/>did not ask more from them.<br/><br/>Towards the 15th of August, the state of the atmosphere was<br/>suddenly moderated by the wind shifting to the northwest. The<br/>temperature rose some degrees, and the accumulated vapor in the air<br/>was not long in resolving into snow. All the island was covered<br/>with a sheet of white, and showed itself to its inhabitants under a<br/>new aspect. The snow fell abundantly for several days, and it soon<br/>reached a thickness of two feet.<br/><br/>The wind also blew with great violence, and at the height of<br/>Granite House the sea could be heard thundering against the reefs.<br/>In some places, the wind, eddying round the corners, formed the<br/>snow into tall whirling columns, resembling those waterspouts which<br/>turn round on their base, and which vessels attack with a shot from<br/>a gun. However, the storm, coming from the northwest, blew across<br/>the island, and the position of Granite House preserved it from a<br/>direct attack.<br/><br/>But in the midst of this snow-storm, as terrible as if it had<br/>been produced in some polar country, neither Cyrus Harding nor his<br/>companions could, notwithstanding their wish for it, venture forth,<br/>and they remained shut up for five days, from the 20th to the 25th<br/>of August. They could hear the tempest raging in Jacamar Wood,<br/>which would surely suffer from it. Many of the trees would no doubt<br/>be torn up by the roots, but Pencroft consoled himself by thinking<br/>that he would not have the trouble of cutting them down.<br/><br/>"The wind is turning woodman, let it alone," he repeated.<br/><br/>
