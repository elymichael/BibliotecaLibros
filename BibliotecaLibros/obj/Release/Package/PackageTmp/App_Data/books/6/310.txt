"But," observed the sailor, "there is one thing which I cannot
explain."

"What is it?"

"If this man had been left for twelve years on Tabor Island, one
may well suppose that he had been several years already in the wild
state in which we found him!"

"That is probable," replied Cyrus Harding.

"It must then be many years since he wrote that document!"

"No doubt," and yet the document appears to have been recently
written!

"Besides, how do you know that the bottle which enclosed the
document may not have taken several years to come from Tabor Island
to Lincoln Island?"

"That is not absolutely impossible," replied the reporter.

"Might it not have been a long time already on the coast of the
island?"

"No," answered Pencroft, "for it was still floating. We could
not even suppose that after it had stayed for any length of time on
the shore, it would have been swept off by the sea, for the south
coast is all rocks, and it would certainly have been smashed to
pieces there!"

"That is true," rejoined Cyrus Harding thoughtfully.
