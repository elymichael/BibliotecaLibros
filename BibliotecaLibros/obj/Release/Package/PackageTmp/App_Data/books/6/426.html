<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>9<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>The convalescence of the young invalid was regularly<br/>progressing. One thing only was now to be desired, that his state<br/>would allow him to be brought to Granite House. However well built<br/>and supplied the corral house was, it could not be so comfortable<br/>as the healthy granite dwelling. Besides, it did not offer the same<br/>security, and its tenants, notwithstanding their watchfulness, were<br/>here always in fear of some shot from the convicts. There, on the<br/>contrary, in the middle of that impregnable and inaccessible cliff,<br/>they would have nothing to fear, and any attack on their persons<br/>would certainly fail. They therefore waited impatiently for the<br/>moment when Herbert might be moved without danger from his wound,<br/>and they were determined to make this move, although the<br/>communication through Jacamar Wood was very difficult.<br/><br/>They had no news from Neb, but were not uneasy on that account.<br/>The courageous Negro, well entrenched in the depths of Granite<br/>House, would not allow himself to be surprised. Top had not been<br/>sent again to him, as it appeared useless to expose the faithful<br/>dog to some shot which might deprive the settlers of their most<br/>useful auxiliary.<br/><br/>They waited, therefore, although they were anxious to be<br/>reunited at Granite House. It pained the engineer to see his forces<br/>divided, for it gave great advantage to the pirates. Since Ayrton's<br/>disappearance they were only four against five, for Herbert could<br/>not yet be counted, and this was not the least care of the brave<br/>boy, who well understood the trouble of which he was the cause.<br/><br/>The question of knowing how, in their condition, they were to<br/>act against the pirates, was thoroughly discussed on the 29th of<br/>November by Cyrus Harding, Gideon Spilett, and Pencroft, at a<br/>moment when Herbert was asleep and could not hear them.<br/><br/>"My friends," said the reporter, after they had talked of Neb<br/>and of the impossibility of communicating with him, "I think,â€”like<br/>you, that to venture on the road to the corral would be to risk<br/>receiving a gunshot without being able to return it. But do you not<br/>think that the best thing to be done now is to openly give chase to<br/>these wretches?"<br/><br/>"That is just what I was thinking," answered Pencroft. "I<br/>believe we're not fellows to be afraid of a bullet, and as for me,<br/>if Captain Harding approves, I'm ready to dash into the forest!<br/>Why, hang it, one man is equal to another!"<br/><br/>
