"The 'Bonadventure!'" exclaimed Ayrton. "She no longer
exists."

"My 'Bonadventure' exists no longer!" shouted Pencroft, bounding
from his seat.

"No," answered Ayrton. "The convicts discovered her in her
little harbor only eight days ago, they put to sea in her—"

"And?" said Pencroft, his heart beating.

"And not having Bob Harvey to steer her, they ran on the rocks,
and the vessel went to pieces."

"Oh, the villains, the cutthroats, the infamous scoundrels!"
exclaimed Pencroft.

"Pencroft," said Herbert, taking the sailor's hand, "we will
build another 'Bonadventure'—a larger one. We have all the
ironwork—all the rigging of the brig at our disposal."

"But do you know," returned Pencroft, "that it will take at
least five or six months to build a vessel of from thirty to forty
tons?"

"We can take our time," said the reporter, "and we must give up
the voyage to Tabor Island for this year."

"Oh, my 'Bonadventure!' my poor 'Bonadventure!'" cried Pencroft,
almost broken-hearted at the destruction of the vessel of which he
was so proud.

The loss of the "Bonadventure" was certainly a thing to be
lamented by the colonists, and it was agreed that this loss should
be repaired as soon as possible. This settled, they now occupied
themselves with bringing their researches to bear on the most
secret parts of the island.
