"Captain Harding," replied Ayrton, "I can give you no better
advice in this matter. Whatever you do will be best; when you wish
me to join you in your researches, I am ready to follow you.

"I thank you, Ayrton," answered Cyrus Harding, "but I should
like a more direct answer to the question I put to you. You are our
companion; you have already endangered your life several times for
us, and you, as well as the rest, ought to be consulted in the
matter of any important decision. Speak, therefore."

"Captain Harding," replied Ayrton, "I think that we ought to do
everything to discover this unknown benefactor. Perhaps he is
alone. Perhaps he is suffering. Perhaps he has a life to be
renewed. I, too, as you said, have a debt of gratitude to pay him.
It was he, it could be only he who must have come to Tabor Island,
who found there the wretch you knew, and who made known to you that
there was an unfortunate man there to be saved. Therefore it is,
thanks to him, that I have become a man again. No, I will never
forget him!"

"That is settled, then," said Cyrus Harding. "We will begin our
researches as soon as possible. We will not leave a corner of the
island unexplored. We will search into its most secret recesses,
and will hope that our unknown friend will pardon us in
consideration of our intentions!"

For several days the colonists were actively employed in
haymaking and the harvest. Before putting their project of
exploring the yet unknown parts of the island into execution, they
wished to get all possible work finished. It was also the time for
collecting the various vegetables from the Tabor Island plants. All
was stowed away, and happily there was no want of room in Granite
House, in which they might have housed all the treasures of the
island. The products of the colony were there, methodically
arranged, and in a safe place, as may be believed, sheltered as
much from animals as from man.

There was no fear of damp in the middle of that thick mass of
granite. Many natural excavations situated in the upper passage
were enlarged either by pick-axe or mine, and Granite House thus
became a general warehouse, containing all the provisions, arms,
tools, and spare utensilsâ€”in a word, all the stores of the
colony.

As to the guns obtained from the brig, they were pretty pieces
of ordnance, which, at Pencroft's entreaty, were hoisted by means
of tackle and pulleys, right up into Granite House; embrasures were
made between the windows, and the shining muzzles of the guns could
soon be seen through the granite cliff. From this height they
commanded all Union Bay. It was like a little Gibraltar, and any
vessel anchored off the islet would inevitably be exposed to the
fire of this aerial battery.

"Captain," said Pencroft one day, it was the 8th of November,
"now that our fortifications are finished, it would be a good thing
if we tried the range of our guns."

"Do you think that is useful?" asked the engineer.

"It is more than useful, it is necessary! Without that how are
we to know to what distance we can send one of those pretty shot
with which we are provided?"
