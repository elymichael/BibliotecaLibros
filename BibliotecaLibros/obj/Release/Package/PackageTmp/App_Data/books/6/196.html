Several pigs, agoutis, kangaroos, and other rodents were seen,<br/>also two or three koalas, at which Pencroft longed to have a<br/>shot.<br/><br/>"But," said he, "you may jump and play just now; we shall have<br/>one or two words to say to you on our way back!"<br/><br/>At half-past nine the way was suddenly found to be barred by an<br/>unknown stream, from thirty to forty feet broad, whose rapid<br/>current dashed foaming over the numerous rocks which interrupted<br/>its course. This creek was deep and clear, but it was absolutely<br/>unnavigable.<br/><br/>"We are cut off!" cried Neb.<br/><br/>"No," replied Herbert, "it is only a stream, and we can easily<br/>swim over."<br/><br/>"What would be the use of that?" returned Harding. "This creek<br/>evidently runs to the sea. Let us remain on this side and follow<br/>the bank, and I shall be much astonished if it does not lead us<br/>very quickly to the coast. Forward!"<br/><br/>"One minute," said the reporter. "The name of this creek, my<br/>friends? Do not let us leave our geography incomplete."<br/><br/>"All right!" said Pencroft.<br/><br/>"Name it, my boy," said the engineer, addressing the lad.<br/><br/>"Will it not be better to wait until we have explored it to its<br/>mouth?" answered Herbert.<br/><br/>"Very well," replied Cyrus Harding. "Let us follow it as fast as<br/>we can without stopping."<br/>
