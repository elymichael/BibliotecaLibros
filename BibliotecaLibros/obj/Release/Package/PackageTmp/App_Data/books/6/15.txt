Pencroft took leave of the two friends, and returned to his
lodging, where young Herbert Brown had remained. The courageous boy
knew of the sailor's plan, and it was not without anxiety that he
awaited the result of the proposal being made to the engineer. Thus
five determined persons were about to abandon themselves to the
mercy of the tempestuous elements!

No! the storm did not abate, and neither Jonathan Forster nor
his companions dreamed of confronting it in that frail car.

It would be a terrible journey. The engineer only feared one
thing; it was that the balloon, held to the ground and dashed about
by the wind, would be torn into shreds. For several hours he roamed
round the nearly- deserted square, surveying the apparatus.
Pencroft did the same on his side, his hands in his pockets,
yawning now and then like a man who did not know how to kill the
time, but really dreading, like his friend, either the escape or
destruction of the balloon. Evening arrived. The night was dark in
the extreme. Thick mists passed like clouds close to the ground.
Rain fell mingled with snow. it was very cold. A mist hung over
Richmond. it seemed as if the violent storm had produced a truce
between the besiegers and the besieged, and that the cannon were
silenced by the louder detonations of the storm. The streets of the
town were deserted. It had not even appeared necessary in that
horrible weather to place a guard in the square, in the midst of
which plunged the balloon. Everything favored the departure of the
prisoners, but what might possibly be the termination of the
hazardous voyage they contemplated in the midst of the furious
elements?â€”

"Dirty weather!" exclaimed Pencroft, fixing his hat firmly on
his head with a blow of his fist; "but pshaw, we shall succeed all
the same!"

At half-past nine, Harding and his companions glided from
different directions into the square, which the gas-lamps,
extinguished by the wind, had left in total obscurity. Even the
enormous balloon, almost beaten to the ground, could not be seen.
Independently of the sacks of ballast, to which the cords of the
net were fastened, the car was held by a strong cable passed
through a ring in the pavement. The five prisoners met by the car.
They had not been perceived, and such was the darkness that they
could not even see each other.

Without speaking a word, Harding, Spilett, Neb, and Herbert took
their places in the car, while Pencroft by the engineer's order
detached successively the bags of ballast. It was the work of a few
minutes only, and the sailor rejoined his companions.

The balloon was then only held by the cable, and the engineer
had nothing to do but to give the word.

At that moment a dog sprang with a bound into the car. It was
Top, a favorite of the engineer. The faithful creature, having
broken his chain, had followed his master. He, however, fearing
that its additional weight might impede their ascent, wished to
send away the animal.

"One more will make but little difference, poor beast!"
exclaimed Pencroft, heaving out two bags of sand, and as he spoke
letting go the cable; the balloon ascending in an oblique
direction, disappeared, after having dashed the car against two
chimneys, which it threw down as it swept by them.

Then, indeed, the full rage of the hurricane was exhibited to
the voyagers. During the night the engineer could not dream of
descending, and when day broke, even a glimpse of the earth below
was intercepted by fog.
