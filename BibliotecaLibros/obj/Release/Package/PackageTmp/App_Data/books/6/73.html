"Perhaps these beasts will not let us pass by willingly," said<br/>Pencroft.<br/><br/>"Well," replied the reporter, who had already hunted the tiger<br/>in India, and the lion in Africa, "we shall soon learn how<br/>successfully to encounter them. But in the meantime we must be upon<br/>our guard!"<br/><br/>They ascended but slowly.<br/><br/>The distance, increased by detours and obstacles which could not<br/>be surmounted directly, was long. Sometimes, too, the ground<br/>suddenly fell, and they found themselves on the edge of a deep<br/>chasm which they had to go round. Thus, in retracing their steps so<br/>as to find some practicable path, much time was employed and<br/>fatigue undergone for nothing. At twelve o'clock, when the small<br/>band of adventurers halted for breakfast at the foot of a large<br/>group of firs, near a little stream which fell in cascades, they<br/>found themselves still half way from the first plateau, which most<br/>probably they would not reach till nightfall. From this point the<br/>view of the sea was much extended, but on the right the high<br/>promontory prevented their seeing whether there was land beyond it.<br/>On the left, the sight extended several miles to the north; but, on<br/>the northwest, at the point occupied by the explorers, it was cut<br/>short by the ridge of a fantastically-shaped spur, which formed a<br/>powerful support of the central cone.<br/><br/>At one o'clock the ascent was continued. They slanted more<br/>towards the southwest and again entered among thick bushes. There<br/>under the shade of the trees fluttered several couples of<br/>gallinaceae belonging to the pheasant species. They were tragopans,<br/>ornamented by a pendant skin which hangs over their throats, and by<br/>two small, round horns, planted behind the eyes. Among these birds,<br/>which were about the size of a fowl, the female was uniformly<br/>brown, while the male was gorgeous in his red plumage, decorated<br/>with white spots. Gideon Spilett, with a stone cleverly and<br/>vigorously thrown, killed one of these tragopans, on which<br/>Pencroft, made hungry by the fresh air, had cast greedy eyes.<br/><br/>After leaving the region of bushes, the party, assisted by<br/>resting on each other's shoulders, climbed for about a hundred feet<br/>up a steep acclivity and reached a level place, with very few<br/>trees, where the soil appeared volcanic. It was necessary to ascend<br/>by zigzags to make the slope more easy, for it was very steep, and<br/>the footing being exceedingly precarious required the greatest<br/>caution. Neb and Herbert took the lead, Pencroft the rear, the<br/>captain and the reporter between them. The animals which frequented<br/>these heights—and there were numerous traces of them— must<br/>necessarily belong to those races of sure foot and supple spine,<br/>chamois or goat. Several were seen, but this was not the name<br/>Pencroft gave them, for all of a sudden—"Sheep!" he shouted.<br/><br/>All stopped about fifty feet from half-a-dozen animals of a<br/>large size, with strong horns bent back and flattened towards the<br/>point, with a woolly fleece, hidden under long silky hair of a<br/>tawny color.<br/><br/>They were not ordinary sheep, but a species usually found in the<br/>mountainous regions of the temperate zone, to which Herbert gave<br/>the name of the musmon.<br/><br/>"Have they legs and chops?" asked the sailor.<br/><br/>"Yes," replied Herbert.<br/><br/>"Well, then, they are sheep!" said Pencroft.<br/>
