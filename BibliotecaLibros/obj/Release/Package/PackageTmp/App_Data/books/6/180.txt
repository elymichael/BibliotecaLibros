"What do I see down there on the beach?"

All eyes turned towards the point indicated.

"Why," said the reporter, "there is something. It looks like
part of a wreck half buried in the sand."

"Ah!" cried Pencroft, "I see what it is!"

"What?" asked Neb.

"Barrels, barrels, which perhaps are full," replied the
sailor.

"Pull to the shore, Pencroft!" said Cyrus.

A few strokes of the oar brought the canoe into a little creek,
and its passengers leaped on shore.

Pencroft was not mistaken. Two barrels were there, half buried
in the sand, but still firmly attached to a large chest, which,
sustained by them, had floated to the moment when it stranded on
the beach.

"There has been a wreck, then, in some part of the island," said
Herbert.
