"I do."

"It is nevertheless many years since I have held any
communication with the inhabited world; three long years have I
passed in the depth of the sea, the only place where I have found
liberty! Who then can have betrayed my secret?"

"A man who was bound to you by no tie, Captain Nemo, and who,
consequently, cannot be accused of treachery."

"The Frenchman who was cast on board my vessel by chance sixteen
years since?"

"The same."

"He and his two companions did not then perish in the maelstrom,
in the midst of which the 'Nautilus' was struggling?"

"They escaped, and a book has appeared under the title of
'Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea,' which contains your
history."

"The history of a few months only of my life!" interrupted the
captain impetuously.

"It is true," answered Cyrus Harding, "but a few months of that
strange life have sufficed to make you known."

"As a great criminal, doubtless!" said Captain Nemo, a haughty
smile curling his lips. "Yes, a rebel, perhaps an outlaw against
humanity!"
