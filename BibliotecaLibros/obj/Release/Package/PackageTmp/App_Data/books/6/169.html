"And that a bullet," added Gideon Spilett, "wounded, though not<br/>mortally, this little animal."<br/><br/>"That is unquestionable," said Cyrus Harding, "and these are the<br/>deductions which must be drawn from this incident: that the island<br/>was inhabited before our arrival, or that men have landed here<br/>within three months. Did these men arrive here voluntarily or<br/>involuntarily, by disembarking on the shore or by being wrecked?<br/>This point can only be cleared up later. As to what they were,<br/>Europeans or Malays, enemies or friends of our race, we cannot<br/>possibly guess; and if they still inhabit the island, or if they<br/>have left it, we know not. But these questions are of too much<br/>importance to be allowed to remain long unsettled."<br/><br/>"No! a hundred times no! a thousand times no!" cried the sailor,<br/>springing up from the table. "There are no other men than ourselves<br/>on Lincoln Island! By my faith! The island isn't large and if it<br/>had been inhabited, we should have seen some of the inhabitants<br/>long before this!"<br/><br/>"In fact, the contrary would be very astonishing," said<br/>Herbert.<br/><br/>"But it would be much more astonishing, I should think, observed<br/>the reporter, "if this peccary had been born with a bullet in its<br/>inside!"<br/><br/>"At least," said Neb seriously, "if Pencroft has not hadâ€”"<br/><br/>"Look here, Neb," burst out Pencroft. "Do you think I could have<br/>a bullet in my jaw for five or six months without finding it out?<br/>Where could it be hidden?" he asked, opening his mouth to show the<br/>two-and-thirty teeth with which it was furnished. "Look well, Neb,<br/>and if you find one hollow tooth in this set, I will let you pull<br/>out half a dozen!"<br/><br/>"Neb's supposition is certainly inadmissible," replied Harding,<br/>who, notwithstanding the gravity of his thoughts, could not<br/>restrain a smile. "It is certain that a gun has been fired in the<br/>island, within three months at most. But I am inclined to think<br/>that the people who landed on this coast were only here a very<br/>short time ago, or that they just touched here; for if, when we<br/>surveyed the island from the summit of Mount Franklin, it had been<br/>inhabited, we should have seen them or we should have been seen<br/>ourselves. It is therefore, probable that within only a few weeks<br/>castaways have been thrown by a storm on some part of the coast.<br/>However that may be, it is of consequence to us to have this point<br/>settled."<br/><br/>"I think that we should act with caution," said the<br/>reporter.<br/><br/>"Such is my advice," replied Cyrus Harding, "for it is to be<br/>feared that Malay pirates have landed on the island!"<br/><br/>"Captain," asked the sailor, "would it not be a good plan,<br/>before setting out, to build a canoe in which we could either<br/>ascend the river, or, if we liked, coast round the inland? It will<br/>not do to be unprovided."<br/>
