The cords which shackled the prisoner's feet were cut off, but<br/>his arms remained securely fastened. He got up by himself and did<br/>not manifest any desire to run away. His hard eyes darted a<br/>piercing glance at the three men, who walked near him, but nothing<br/>denoted that he recollected being their fellow, or at least having<br/>been so. A continual hissing sound issued from his lips, his aspect<br/>was wild, but he did not attempt to resist.<br/><br/>By the reporter's advice the unfortunate man was taken to the<br/>hut. Perhaps the sight of the things that belonged to him would<br/>make some impression on him! Perhaps a spark would be sufficient to<br/>revive his obscured intellect, to rekindle his dulled soul. The<br/>dwelling was not far off. In a few minutes they arrived there, but<br/>the prisoner remembered nothing, and it appeared that he had lost<br/>consciousness of everything.<br/><br/>What could they think of the degree of brutishness into which<br/>this miserable being had fallen, unless that his imprisonment on<br/>the islet dated from a very distant period and after having arrived<br/>there a rational being solitude had reduced him to this<br/>condition.<br/><br/>The reporter then thought that perhaps the sight of fire would<br/>have some effect on him, and in a moment one of those beautiful<br/>flames, that attract even animals, blazed up on the hearth. The<br/>sight of the flame seemed at first to fix the attention of the<br/>unhappy object, but soon he turned away and the look of<br/>intelligence faded. Evidently there was nothing to be done, for the<br/>time at least, but to take him on board the "Bonadventure." This<br/>was done, and he remained there in Pencroft's charge.<br/><br/>Herbert and Spilett returned to finish their work; and some<br/>hours after they came back to the shore, carrying the utensils and<br/>guns, a store of vegetables, of seeds, some game, and two couple of<br/>pigs.<br/><br/>All was embarked, and the "Bonadventure" was ready to weigh<br/>anchor and sail with the morning tide.<br/><br/>The prisoner had been placed in the fore-cabin, where he<br/>remained quiet, silent, apparently deaf and dumb.<br/><br/>Pencroft offered him something to eat, but he pushed away the<br/>cooked meat that was presented to him and which doubtless did not<br/>suit him. But on the sailor showing him one of the ducks which<br/>Herbert had killed, he pounced on it like a wild beast, and<br/>devoured it greedily.<br/><br/>"You think that he will recover his senses?" asked Pencroft. "It<br/>is not impossible that our care will have an effect upon him, for<br/>it is solitude that has made him what he is, and from this time<br/>forward he will be no longer alone."<br/><br/>"The poor man must no doubt have been in this state for a long<br/>time," said Herbert.<br/><br/>"Perhaps," answered Gideon Spilett.<br/>
