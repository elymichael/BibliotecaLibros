<br/>"Indeed," answered Herbert, "nothing here betrays the presence<br/>of man."<br/><br/>"Let us go down," said Pencroft, "and search."<br/><br/>The sailor and his two companions returned to the shore, to the<br/>place where they had left the "Bonadventure."<br/><br/>They had decided to make the tour of the island on foot, before<br/>exploring the interior; so that not a spot should escape their<br/>investigations. The beach was easy to follow, and only in some<br/>places was their way barred by large rocks, which, however, they<br/>easily passed round. The explorers proceeded towards the south,<br/>disturbing numerous flocks of sea-birds and herds of seals, which<br/>threw themselves into the sea as soon as they saw the strangers at<br/>a distance.<br/><br/>"Those beasts yonder," observed the reporter, "do not see men<br/>for the first time. They fear them, therefore they must know<br/>them."<br/><br/>An hour after their departure they arrived on the southern point<br/>of the islet, terminated by a sharp cape, and proceeded towards the<br/>north along the western coast, equally formed by sand and rocks,<br/>the background bordered with thick woods.<br/><br/>There was not a trace of a habitation in any part, not the print<br/>of a human foot on the shore of the island, which after four hours'<br/>walking had been gone completely round.<br/><br/>It was to say the least very extraordinary, and they were<br/>compelled to believe that Tabor Island was not or was no longer<br/>inhabited. Perhaps, after all the document was already several<br/>months or several years old, and it was possible in this case,<br/>either that the castaway had been enabled to return to his country,<br/>or that he had died of misery.<br/><br/>Pencroft, Spilett, and Herbert, forming more or less probable<br/>conjectures, dined rapidly on board the "Bonadventure" so as to be<br/>able to continue their excursion until nightfall. This was done at<br/>five o'clock in the evening, at which hour they entered the<br/>wood.<br/><br/>Numerous animals fled at their approach, being principally, one<br/>might say, only goats and pigs, which were obviously European<br/>species.<br/><br/>
