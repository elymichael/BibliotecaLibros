The settlers in Lincoln Island had now regained their dwelling,
without having been obliged to reach it by the old opening, and
were therefore spared the trouble of mason's work. It was certainly
lucky, that at the moment they were about to set out to do so, the
apes had been seized with that terror, no less sudden than
inexplicable, which had driven them out of Granite House. Had the
animals discovered that they were about to be attacked from another
direction? This was the only explanation of their sudden
retreat.

During the day the bodies of the apes were carried into the
wood, where they were buried; then the settlers busied themselves
in repairing the disorder caused by the intruders, disorder but not
damage, for although they had turned everything in the rooms
topsy-turvy, yet they had broken nothing. Neb relighted his stove,
and the stores in the larder furnished a substantial repast, to
which all did ample justice.

Jup was not forgotten, and he ate with relish some stonepine
almonds and rhizome roots, with which he was abundantly supplied.
Pencroft had unfastened his arms, but judged it best to have his
legs tied until they were more sure of his submission.

Then, before retiring to rest, Harding and his companions seated
round their table, discussed those plans, the execution of which
was most pressing. The most important and most urgent was the
establishment of a bridge over the Mercy, so as to form a
communication with the southern part of the island and Granite
House; then the making of an enclosure for the musmons or other
woolly animals which they wished to capture.

These two projects would help to solve the difficulty as to
their clothing, which was now serious. The bridge would render easy
the transport of the balloon case, which would furnish them with
linen, and the inhabitants of the enclosure would yield wool which
would supply them with winter clothes.

As to the enclosure, it was Cyrus Harding's intention to
establish it at the sources of the Red Creek, where the ruminants
would find fresh and abundant pasture. The road between Prospect
Heights and the sources of the stream was already partly beaten,
and with a better cart than the first, the material could be easily
conveyed to the spot, especially if they could manage to capture
some animals to draw it.
