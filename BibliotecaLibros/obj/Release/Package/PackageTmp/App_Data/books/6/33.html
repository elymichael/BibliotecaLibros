<br/>"At last!" cried Pencroft, getting up; "I was never so nervous<br/>before in all my life!"<br/><br/>The flat stones made a capital fireplace. The smoke went quite<br/>easily out at the narrow passage, the chimney drew, and an<br/>agreeable warmth was not long in being felt.<br/><br/>They must now take great care not to let the fire go out, and<br/>always to keep some embers alight. It only needed care and<br/>attention, as they had plenty of wood and could renew their store<br/>at any time.<br/><br/>Pencroft's first thought was to use the fire by preparing a more<br/>nourishing supper than a dish of shell-fish. Two dozen eggs were<br/>brought by Herbert. The reporter leaning up in a corner, watched<br/>these preparations without saying anything. A threefold thought<br/>weighed on his mind. Was Cyrus still alive? If he was alive, where<br/>was he? If he had survived from his fall, how was it that he had<br/>not found some means of making known his existence? As to Neb, he<br/>was roaming about the shore. He was like a body without a soul.<br/><br/>Pencroft knew fifty ways of cooking eggs, but this time he had<br/>no choice, and was obliged to content himself with roasting them<br/>under the hot cinders. In a few minutes the cooking was done, and<br/>the seaman invited the reporter to take his share of the supper.<br/>Such was the first repast of the castaways on this unknown coast.<br/>The hard eggs were excellent, and as eggs contain everything<br/>indispensable to man's nourishment, these poor people thought<br/>themselves well off, and were much strengthened by them. Oh! if<br/>only one of them had not been missing at this meal! If the five<br/>prisoners who escaped from Richmond had been all there, under the<br/>piled-up rocks, before this clear, crackling fire on the dry sand,<br/>what thanksgiving must they have rendered to Heaven! But the most<br/>ingenious, the most learned, he who was their unquestioned chief,<br/>Cyrus Harding, was, alas! missing, and his body had not even<br/>obtained a burial-place.<br/><br/>Thus passed the 25th of March. Night had come on. Outside could<br/>be heard the howling of the wind and the monotonous sound of the<br/>surf breaking on the shore. The waves rolled the shingle backwards<br/>and forwards with a deafening noise.<br/><br/>The reporter retired into a dark corner after having shortly<br/>noted down the occurrences of the day; the first appearance of this<br/>new land, the loss of their leader, the exploration of the coast,<br/>the incident of the matches, etc.; and then overcome by fatigue, he<br/>managed to forget his sorrows in sleep. Herbert went to sleep<br/>directly. As to the sailor, he passed the night with one eye on the<br/>fire, on which he did not spare fuel. But one of the castaways did<br/>not sleep in the cave. The inconsolable, despairing Neb,<br/>notwithstanding all that his companions could say to induce him to<br/>take some rest, wandered all night long on the shore calling on his<br/>master.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
