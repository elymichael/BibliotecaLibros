"The 'Bonadventure!'" exclaimed Ayrton. "She no longer<br/>exists."<br/><br/>"My 'Bonadventure' exists no longer!" shouted Pencroft, bounding<br/>from his seat.<br/><br/>"No," answered Ayrton. "The convicts discovered her in her<br/>little harbor only eight days ago, they put to sea in her—"<br/><br/>"And?" said Pencroft, his heart beating.<br/><br/>"And not having Bob Harvey to steer her, they ran on the rocks,<br/>and the vessel went to pieces."<br/><br/>"Oh, the villains, the cutthroats, the infamous scoundrels!"<br/>exclaimed Pencroft.<br/><br/>"Pencroft," said Herbert, taking the sailor's hand, "we will<br/>build another 'Bonadventure'—a larger one. We have all the<br/>ironwork—all the rigging of the brig at our disposal."<br/><br/>"But do you know," returned Pencroft, "that it will take at<br/>least five or six months to build a vessel of from thirty to forty<br/>tons?"<br/><br/>"We can take our time," said the reporter, "and we must give up<br/>the voyage to Tabor Island for this year."<br/><br/>"Oh, my 'Bonadventure!' my poor 'Bonadventure!'" cried Pencroft,<br/>almost broken-hearted at the destruction of the vessel of which he<br/>was so proud.<br/><br/>The loss of the "Bonadventure" was certainly a thing to be<br/>lamented by the colonists, and it was agreed that this loss should<br/>be repaired as soon as possible. This settled, they now occupied<br/>themselves with bringing their researches to bear on the most<br/>secret parts of the island.<br/>
