<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>7<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>The settlers in Lincoln Island had now regained their dwelling,<br/>without having been obliged to reach it by the old opening, and<br/>were therefore spared the trouble of mason's work. It was certainly<br/>lucky, that at the moment they were about to set out to do so, the<br/>apes had been seized with that terror, no less sudden than<br/>inexplicable, which had driven them out of Granite House. Had the<br/>animals discovered that they were about to be attacked from another<br/>direction? This was the only explanation of their sudden<br/>retreat.<br/><br/>During the day the bodies of the apes were carried into the<br/>wood, where they were buried; then the settlers busied themselves<br/>in repairing the disorder caused by the intruders, disorder but not<br/>damage, for although they had turned everything in the rooms<br/>topsy-turvy, yet they had broken nothing. Neb relighted his stove,<br/>and the stores in the larder furnished a substantial repast, to<br/>which all did ample justice.<br/><br/>Jup was not forgotten, and he ate with relish some stonepine<br/>almonds and rhizome roots, with which he was abundantly supplied.<br/>Pencroft had unfastened his arms, but judged it best to have his<br/>legs tied until they were more sure of his submission.<br/><br/>Then, before retiring to rest, Harding and his companions seated<br/>round their table, discussed those plans, the execution of which<br/>was most pressing. The most important and most urgent was the<br/>establishment of a bridge over the Mercy, so as to form a<br/>communication with the southern part of the island and Granite<br/>House; then the making of an enclosure for the musmons or other<br/>woolly animals which they wished to capture.<br/><br/>These two projects would help to solve the difficulty as to<br/>their clothing, which was now serious. The bridge would render easy<br/>the transport of the balloon case, which would furnish them with<br/>linen, and the inhabitants of the enclosure would yield wool which<br/>would supply them with winter clothes.<br/><br/>As to the enclosure, it was Cyrus Harding's intention to<br/>establish it at the sources of the Red Creek, where the ruminants<br/>would find fresh and abundant pasture. The road between Prospect<br/>Heights and the sources of the stream was already partly beaten,<br/>and with a better cart than the first, the material could be easily<br/>conveyed to the spot, especially if they could manage to capture<br/>some animals to draw it.<br/><br/>
