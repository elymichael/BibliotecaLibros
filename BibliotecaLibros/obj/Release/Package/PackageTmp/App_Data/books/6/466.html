"Then the volcano is not totally extinct?" said the<br/>reporter.<br/><br/>"It is possible that since our exploration of the crater,"<br/>replied Cyrus Harding, "some change has occurred. Any volcano,<br/>although considered extinct, may evidently again burst forth."<br/><br/>"But if an eruption of Mount Franklin occurred," asked Spilett,<br/>"would there not be some danger to Lincoln Island?"<br/><br/>"I do not think so," answered the reporter. "The crater, that is<br/>to say, the safety-valve, exists, and the overflow of smoke and<br/>lava, would escape, as it did formerly, by this customary<br/>outlet."<br/><br/>"Unless the lava opened a new way for itself towards the fertile<br/>parts of the island!"<br/><br/>"And why, my dear Spilett," answered Cyrus Harding, "should it<br/>not follow the road naturally traced out for it?"<br/><br/>"Well, volcanoes are capricious," returned the reporter.<br/><br/>"Notice," answered the engineer, "that the inclination of Mount<br/>Franklin favors the flow of water towards the valleys which we are<br/>exploring just now. To turn aside this flow, an earthquake would be<br/>necessary to change the mountain's center of gravity."<br/><br/>"But an earthquake is always to be feared at these times,"<br/>observed Gideon Spilett.<br/><br/>"Always," replied the engineer, "especially when the<br/>subterranean forces begin to awake, as they risk meeting with some<br/>obstruction, after a long rest. Thus, my dear Spilett, an eruption<br/>would be a serious thing for us, and it would be better that the<br/>volcano should not have the slightest desire to wake up. But we<br/>could not prevent it, could we? At any rate, even if it should<br/>occur, I do not think Prospect Heights would he seriously<br/>threatened. Between them and the mountain, the ground is<br/>considerably depressed, and if the lava should ever take a course<br/>towards the lake, it would be cast on the downs and the neighboring<br/>parts of Shark Gulf."<br/><br/>"We have not yet seen any smoke at the top of the mountain, to<br/>indicate an approaching eruption," said Gideon Spilett.<br/>
