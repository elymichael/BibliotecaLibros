They advanced to within five cables-lengths of that part of the
shore terminated by Flotsam Point, and after having rounded it in a
semicircular line, still protected by the brig's guns, they
proceeded towards the mouth of the Mercy.

Their evident intention was to penetrate into the channel, and
cut off the colonists posted on the islet, in such a way, that
whatever their number might be, being placed between the fire from
the boat and the fire from the brig, they would find themselves in
a very disadvantageous position.

A quarter of an hour passed while the boat advanced in this
direction. Absolute silence, perfect calm reigned in the air and on
the water.

Pencroft and Ayrton, although they knew they ran the risk of
being cut off, had not left their post, both that they did not wish
to show themselves as yet to their assailants, and expose
themselves to the "Speedy's" guns, and that they relied on Neb and
Gideon Spilett, watching at the mouth of the river, and on Cyrus
Harding and Herbert, in ambush among the rocks at the Chimneys.

Twenty minutes after the first shots were fired, the boat was
less than two cables-lengths off the Mercy. As the tide was
beginning to rise with its accustomed violence, caused by the
narrowness of the straits, the pirates were drawn towards the
river, and it was only by dint of hard rowing that they were able
to keep in the middle of the channel. But, as they were passing
within good range of the mouth of the Mercy, two balls saluted
them, and two more of their number were laid in the bottom of the
boat. Neb and Spilett had not missed their aim.

The brig immediately sent a second ball on the post betrayed by
the smoke, but without any other result than that of splintering
the rock.

The boat now contained only three able men. Carried on by the
current, it shot through the channel with the rapidity of an arrow,
passed before Harding and Herbert, who, not thinking it within
range, withheld their fire, then, rounding the northern point of
the islet with the two remaining oars, they pulled towards the
brig.

Hitherto the settlers had nothing to complain of. Their
adversaries had certainly had the worst of it. The latter already
counted four men seriously wounded if not dead; they, on the
contrary, unwounded, had not missed a shot. If the pirates
continued to attack them in this way, if they renewed their attempt
to land by means of a boat, they could be destroyed one by one.

It was now seen how advantageous the engineer's arrangements had
been. The pirates would think that they had to deal with numerous
and well-armed adversaries, whom they could not easily get the
better of.

Half an hour passed before the boat, having to pull against the
current, could get alongside the "Speedy." Frightful cries were
heard when they returned on board with the wounded, and two or
three guns were fired with no results.

But now about a dozen other convicts, maddened with rage, and
possibly by the effect of the evening's potations, threw themselves
into the boat. A second boat was also lowered, in which eight men
took their places, and while the first pulled straight for the
islet, to dislodge the colonists from thence the second maneuvered
so as to force the entrance of the Mercy.
