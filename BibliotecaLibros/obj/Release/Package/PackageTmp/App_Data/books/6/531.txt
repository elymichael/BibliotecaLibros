Then Ayrton, approaching the engineer, said simply, "Where
should this coffer be deposited?"

It was the coffer which Ayrton had saved at the risk of his
life, at the very instant that the island had been engulfed, and
which he now faithfully handed to the engineer.

"Ayrton! Ayrton!" said Cyrus Harding, deeply touched. Then,
addressing Robert Grant, "Sir," he added, "you left behind you a
criminal; you find in his place a man who has become honest by
penitence, and whose hand I am proud to clasp in mine."

Robert Grant was now made acquainted with the strange history of
Captain Nemo and the colonists of Lincoln Island. Then, observation
being taken of what remained of this shoal, which must henceforward
figure on the charts of the Pacific, the order was given to make
all sail.

A few weeks afterwards the colonists landed in America, and
found their country once more at peace alter the terrible conflict
in which right and justice had triumphed.

Of the treasures contained in the coffer left by Captain Nemo to
the colonists of Lincoln Island, the larger portion was employed in
the purchase of a vast territory in the State of Iowa. One pearl
alone, the finest, was reserved from the treasure and sent to Lady
Glenarvan in the name of the castaways restored to their country by
the "Duncan."

There, upon this domain, the colonists invited to labor, that is
to say, to wealth and happiness, all those to whom they had hoped
to offer the hospitality of Lincoln Island. There was founded a
vast colony to which they gave the name of that island sunk beneath
the waters of the Pacific. A river there was called the Mercy, a
mountain took the name of Mount Franklin, a small lake was named
Lake Grant, and the forests became the forests of the Far West. It
might have been an island on terra firma.

There, under the intelligent hands of the engineer and his
companions, everything prospered. Not one of the former colonists
of Lincoln Island was absent, for they had sworn to live always
together. Neb was with his master; Ayrton was there ready to
sacrifice himself for all; Pencroft was more a farmer than he had
ever been a sailor; Herbert, who completed his studies under the
superintendence of Cyrus Harding, and Gideon Spilett, who founded
the New Lincoln Herald, the best-informed journal in the world.

There Cyrus Harding and his companions received at intervals
visits from Lord and Lady Glenarvan, Captain John Mangles and his
wife, the sister of Robert Grant, Robert Grant himself, Major
McNab, and all those who had taken part in the history both of
Captain Grant and Captain Nemo.

There, to conclude, all were happy, united in the present as
they had been in the past; but never could they forget that island
upon which they had arrived poor and friendless, that island which,
during four years had supplied all their wants, and of which there
remained but a fragment of granite washed by the waves of the
Pacific, the tomb of him who had borne the name of Captain
Nemo.
