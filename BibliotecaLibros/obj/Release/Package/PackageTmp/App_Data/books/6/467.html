<br/>"No," answered Harding, "not a vapor escapes from the crater,<br/>for it was only yesterday that I attentively surveyed the summit.<br/>But it is probable that at the lower part of the chimney, time may<br/>have accumulated rocks, cinders, hardened lava, and that this valve<br/>of which I spoke, may at any time become overcharged. But at the<br/>first serious effort, every obstacle will disappear, and you may be<br/>certain, my dear Spilett, that neither the island, which is the<br/>boiler, nor the volcano, which is the chimney, will burst under the<br/>pressure of gas. Nevertheless, I repeat, it would be better that<br/>there should not be an eruption."<br/><br/>"And yet we are not mistaken," remarked the reporter.<br/>"Mutterings can be distinctly heard in the very bowels of the<br/>volcano!"<br/><br/>"You are right," said the engineer, again listening attentively.<br/>"There can be no doubt of it. A commotion is going on there, of<br/>which we can neither estimate the importance nor the ultimate<br/>result."<br/><br/>Cyrus Harding and Spilett, on coming out, rejoined their<br/>companions, to whom they made known the state of affairs.<br/><br/>"Very well!" cried Pencroft, "The volcano wants to play his<br/>pranks! Let him try, if he likes! He will find his master!"<br/><br/>"Who?" asked Neb.<br/><br/>"Our good genius, Neb, our good genius, who will shut his mouth<br/>for him, if he so much as pretends to open it!"<br/><br/>As may be seen, the sailor's confidence in the tutelary deity of<br/>his island was absolute, and, certainly, the occult power,<br/>manifested until now in so many inexplicable ways, appeared to be<br/>unlimited; but also it knew how to escape the colonists' most<br/>minute researches, for, in spite of all their efforts, in spite of<br/>the more than zeal,—the obstinacy,—with which they carried on their<br/>exploration, the retreat of the mysterious being could not be<br/>discovered.<br/><br/>From the 19th to the 20th of February the circle of<br/>investigation was extended to all the northern region of Lincoln<br/>Island, whose most secret nooks were explored. The colonists even<br/>went the length of tapping every rock. The search was extended to<br/>the extreme verge of the mountain. It was explored thus to the very<br/>summit of the truncated cone terminating the first row of rocks,<br/>then to the upper ridge of the enormous hat, at the bottom of which<br/>opened the crater.<br/><br/>They did more; they visited the gulf, now extinct, but in whose<br/>depths the rumbling could be distinctly heard. However, no sign of<br/>smoke or vapor, no heating of the rock, indicated an approaching<br/>eruption. But neither there, nor in any other part of Mount<br/>Franklin, did the colonists find any traces of him of whom they<br/>were in search.<br/><br/>
