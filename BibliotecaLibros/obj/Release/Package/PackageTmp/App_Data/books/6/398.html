"Try them, Pencroft," replied the engineer. "However, I think<br/>that in making the experiment, we ought to employ, not the ordinary<br/>powder, the supply of which, I think, should remain untouched, but<br/>the pyroxyle which will never fail us."<br/><br/>"Can the cannon support the shock of the pyroxyle?" asked the<br/>reporter, who was not less anxious than Pencroft to try the<br/>artillery of Granite House.<br/><br/>"I believe so. However," added the engineer, "we will be<br/>prudent." The engineer was right in thinking that the guns were of<br/>excellent make. Made of forged steel, and breech-loaders, they<br/>ought consequently to be able to bear a considerable charge, and<br/>also have an enormous range. In fact, as regards practical effect,<br/>the transit described by the ball ought to be as extended as<br/>possible, and this tension could only be obtained under the<br/>condition that the projectile should be impelled with a very great<br/>initial velocity.<br/><br/>"Now," said Harding to his companions, "the initial velocity is<br/>in proportion to the quantity of powder used. In the fabrication of<br/>these pieces, everything depends on employing a metal with the<br/>highest possible power of resistance, and steel is incontestably<br/>that metal of all others which resists the best. I have, therefore,<br/>reason to believe that our guns will bear without risk the<br/>expansion of the pyroxyle gas, and will give excellent<br/>results."<br/><br/>"We shall be a great deal more certain of that when we have<br/>tried them!" answered Pencroft.<br/><br/>It is unnecessary to say that the four cannons were in perfect<br/>order. Since they had been taken from the water, the sailor had<br/>bestowed great care upon them. How many hours he had spent, in<br/>rubbing, greasing, and polishing them, and in cleaning the<br/>mechanism! And now the pieces were as brilliant as if they had been<br/>on board a frigate of the United States Navy.<br/><br/>On this day, therefore, in presence of all the members of the<br/>colony, including Master Jup and Top, the four cannon were<br/>successively tried. They were charged with pyroxyle, taking into<br/>consideration its explosive power, which, as has been said, is four<br/>times that of ordinary powder: the projectile to be fired was<br/>cylindroconic.<br/><br/>Pencroft, holding the end of the quick-match, stood ready to<br/>fire.<br/><br/>At Harding's signal, he fired. The shot, passing over the islet,<br/>fell into the sea at a distance which could not be calculated with<br/>exactitude.<br/><br/>The second gun was pointed at the rocks at the end of Flotsam<br/>Point, and the shot striking a sharp rock nearly three miles from<br/>Granite House, made it fly into splinters. It was Herbert who had<br/>pointed this gun and fired it, and very proud he was of his first<br/>shot. Pencroft only was prouder than he! Such a shot, the honor of<br/>which belonged to his dear boy.<br/><br/>The third shot, aimed this time at the downs forming the upper<br/>side of Union Bay, struck the sand at a distance of four miles,<br/>then having ricocheted: was lost in the sea in a cloud of<br/>spray.<br/>
