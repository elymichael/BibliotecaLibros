Neb did not hesitate. He wrote the note, he tied it to Jup's<br/>neck, he brought the ape to the door of Granite House, from which<br/>he let down a long cord to the ground; then, several times he<br/>repeated these words,—<br/><br/>"Jup Jup! corral, corral!"<br/><br/>The creature understood, seized the cord, glided rapidly down<br/>the beach, and disappeared in the darkness without the convicts'<br/>attention having been in the least excited.<br/><br/>"You did well, Neb," said Harding, "but perhaps in not warning<br/>us you would have done still better!"<br/><br/>And, in speaking thus, Cyrus Harding thought of Herbert, whose<br/>recovery the removal had so seriously checked.<br/><br/>Neb ended his account. The convicts had not appeared at all on<br/>the beach. Not knowing the number of the island's inhabitants, they<br/>might suppose that Granite House was defended by a large party.<br/>They must have remembered that during the attack by the brig<br/>numerous shot had been fired both from the lower and upper rocks,<br/>and no doubt they did not wish to expose themselves. But the<br/>plateau of Prospect Heights was open to them, and not covered by<br/>the fire of Granite House. They gave themselves up, therefore, to<br/>their instinct of destruction,—plundering, burning, devastating<br/>everything,—and only retiring half an hour before the arrival of<br/>the colonists, whom they believed still confined in the corral.<br/><br/>On their retreat, Neb hurried out. He climbed the plateau at the<br/>risk of being perceived and fired at, tried to extinguish the fire<br/>which was consuming the buildings of the poultry-yard, and had<br/>struggled, though in vain, against it until the cart appeared at<br/>the edge of the wood.<br/><br/>Such had been these serious events. The presence of the convicts<br/>constituted a permanent source of danger to the settlers in Lincoln<br/>Island, until then so happy, and who might now expect still greater<br/>misfortunes.<br/><br/>Spilett remained in Granite House with Herbert and Pencroft,<br/>while Cyrus Harding, accompanied by Neb, proceeded to judge for<br/>himself of the extent of the disaster.<br/><br/>It was fortunate that the convicts had not advanced to the foot<br/>of Granite House. The workshop at the Chimneys would in that case<br/>not have escaped destruction. But after all, this evil would have<br/>been more easily reparable than the ruins accumulated on the<br/>plateau of Prospect Heights. Harding and Neb proceeded towards the<br/>Mercy, and ascended its left bank without meeting with any trace of<br/>the convicts; nor on the other side of the river, in the depths of<br/>the wood, could they perceive any suspicious indications.<br/><br/>Besides, it might be supposed that in all probability either the<br/>convicts knew of the return of the settlers to Granite House, by<br/>having seen them pass on the road from the corral, or, after the<br/>devastation of the plateau, they had penetrated into Jacamar Wood,<br/>following the course of the Mercy, and were thus ignorant of their<br/>return.<br/>
