<br/>"What are you doing here?" again said Bob Harvey, seizing Ayrton<br/>by the waistband.<br/><br/>But Ayrton, without replying, wrenched himself from his grasp<br/>and attempted to rush into the magazine. A shot fired into the<br/>midst of the powder-casks, and all would be over!<br/><br/>"Help, lads!" shouted Bob Harvey.<br/><br/>At his shout two or three pirates awoke, jumped up, and, rushing<br/>on Ayrton, endeavored to throw him down. He soon extricated himself<br/>from their grasp. He fired his revolver, and two of the convicts<br/>fell, but a blow from a knife which he could not ward off made a<br/>gash in his shoulder.<br/><br/>Ayrton perceived that he could no longer hope to carry out his<br/>project. Bob Harvey had reclosed the door of the powder-magazine,<br/>and a movement on the deck indicated a general awakening of the<br/>pirates. Ayrton must reserve himself to fight at the side of Cyrus<br/>Harding. There was nothing for him but flight!<br/><br/>But was flight still possible? It was doubtful, yet Ayrton<br/>resolved to dare everything in order to rejoin his companions.<br/><br/>Four barrels of the revolver were still undischarged. Two were<br/>firedâ€” one, aimed at Bob Harvey, did not wound him, or at any rate<br/>only slightly, and Ayrton, profiting by the momentary retreat of<br/>his adversaries, rushed towards the companion-ladder to gain the<br/>deck. Passing before the lantern, he smashed it with a blow from<br/>the butt of his revolver. A profound darkness ensued, which favored<br/>his flight. Two or three pirates, awakened by the noise, were<br/>descending the ladder at the same moment.<br/><br/>A fifth shot from Ayrton laid one low, and the others drew back,<br/>not understanding what was going on. Ayrton was on deck in two<br/>bounds, and three seconds later, having discharged his last barrel<br/>in the face of a pirate who was about to seize him by the throat,<br/>he leaped over the bulwarks into the sea.<br/><br/>Ayrton had not made six strokes before shots were splashing<br/>around him like hail.<br/><br/>What were Pencroft's feelings, sheltered under a rock on the<br/>islet! What were those of Harding, the reporter, Herbert, and Neb,<br/>crouched in the Chimneys, when they heard the reports on board the<br/>brig! They rushed out on to the beach, and, their guns shouldered,<br/>they stood ready to repel any attack.<br/><br/>
