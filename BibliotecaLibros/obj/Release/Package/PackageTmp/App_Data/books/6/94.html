<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>13<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>"Well, captain, where are we going to begin?" asked Pencroft<br/>next morning of the engineer.<br/><br/>"At the beginning," replied Cyrus Harding.<br/><br/>And in fact, the settlers were compelled to begin "at the very<br/>beginning." They did not possess even the tools necessary for<br/>making tools, and they were not even in the condition of nature,<br/>who, "having time, husbands her strength." They had no time, since<br/>they had to provide for the immediate wants of their existence, and<br/>though, profiting by acquired experience, they had nothing to<br/>invent, still they had everything to make; their iron and their<br/>steel were as yet only in the state of minerals, their earthenware<br/>in the state of clay, their linen and their clothes in the state of<br/>textile material.<br/><br/>It must be said, however, that the settlers were "men" in the<br/>complete and higher sense of the word. The engineer Harding could<br/>not have been seconded by more intelligent companions, nor with<br/>more devotion and zeal. He had tried them. He knew their<br/>abilities.<br/><br/>Gideon Spilett, a talented reporter, having learned everything<br/>so as to be able to speak of everything, would contribute largely<br/>with his head and hands to the colonization of the island. He would<br/>not draw back from any task: a determined sportsman, he would make<br/>a business of what till then had only been a pleasure to him.<br/><br/>Herbert, a gallant boy, already remarkably well informed in the<br/>natural sciences, would render greater service to the common<br/>cause.<br/><br/>
