"Is it a freshwater lake?" asked Pencroft.<br/><br/>"Certainly," replied the engineer, "for it must be fed by the<br/>water which flows from the mountain."<br/><br/>"I see a little river which runs into it," said Herbert,<br/>pointing out a narrow stream, which evidently took its source<br/>somewhere in the west.<br/><br/>"Yes," said Harding; "and since this stream feeds the lake, most<br/>probably on the side near the sea there is an outlet by which the<br/>surplus water escapes. We shall see that on our return."<br/><br/>This little winding watercourse and the river already mentioned<br/>constituted the water-system, at least such as it was displayed to<br/>the eyes of the explorers. However, it was possible that under the<br/>masses of trees which covered two-thirds of the island, forming an<br/>immense forest, other rivers ran towards the sea. It might even be<br/>inferred that such was the case, so rich did this region appear in<br/>the most magnificent specimens of the flora of the temperate zones.<br/>There was no indication of running water in the north, though<br/>perhaps there might be stagnant water among the marshes in the<br/>northeast; but that was all, in addition to the downs, sand, and<br/>aridity which contrasted so strongly with the luxuriant vegetation<br/>of the rest of the island.<br/><br/>The volcano did not occupy the central part; it rose, on the<br/>contrary, in the northwestern region, and seemed to mark the<br/>boundary of the two zones. At the southwest, at the south, and the<br/>southeast, the first part of the spurs were hidden under masses of<br/>verdure. At the north, on the contrary, one could follow their<br/>ramifications, which died away on the sandy plains. It was on this<br/>side that, at the time when the mountain was in a state of<br/>eruption, the discharge had worn away a passage, and a large heap<br/>of lava had spread to the narrow jaw which formed the northeastern<br/>gulf.<br/><br/>Cyrus Harding and his companions remained an hour at the top of<br/>the mountain. The island was displayed under their eyes, like a<br/>plan in relief with different tints, green for the forests, yellow<br/>for the sand, blue for the water. They viewed it in its<br/>tout-ensemble, nothing remained concealed but the ground hidden by<br/>verdure, the hollows of the valleys, and the interior of the<br/>volcanic chasms.<br/><br/>One important question remained to be solved, and the answer<br/>would have a great effect upon the future of the castaways.<br/><br/>Was the island inhabited?<br/><br/>It was the reporter who put this question, to which after the<br/>close examination they had just made, the answer seemed to be in<br/>the negative.<br/><br/>Nowhere could the work of a human hand be perceived. Not a group<br/>of huts, not a solitary cabin, not a fishery on the shore. No smoke<br/>curling in the air betrayed the presence of man. It is true, a<br/>distance of nearly thirty miles separated the observers from the<br/>extreme points, that is, of the tail which extended to the<br/>southwest, and it would have been difficult, even to Pencroft's<br/>eyes, to discover a habitation there. Neither could the curtain of<br/>verdure, which covered three-quarters of the island, be raised to<br/>see if it did not shelter some straggling village. But in general<br/>the islanders live on the shores of the narrow spaces which emerge<br/>above the waters of the Pacific, and this shore appeared to be an<br/>absolute desert.<br/>
