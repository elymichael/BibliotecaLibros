<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>8<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>So the convicts were still there, watching the corral, and<br/>determined to kill the settlers one after the other. There was<br/>nothing to be done but to treat them as wild beasts. But great<br/>precautions must be taken, for just now the wretches had the<br/>advantage on their side, seeing, and not being seen, being able to<br/>surprise by the suddenness of their attack, yet not to be surprised<br/>themselves. Harding made arrangements, therefore, for living in the<br/>corral, of which the provisions would last for a tolerable length<br/>of time. Ayrton's house had been provided with all that was<br/>necessary for existence, and the convicts, scared by the arrival of<br/>the settlers, had not had time to pillage it. It was probable, as<br/>Gideon Spilett observed, that things had occurred as follows:<br/><br/>The six convicts, disembarking on the island, had followed the<br/>southern shore, and after having traversed the double shore of the<br/>Serpentine Peninsula, not being inclined to venture into the Far<br/>West woods, they had reached the mouth of Falls River. From this<br/>point, by following the right bank of the watercourse, they would<br/>arrive at the spurs of Mount Franklin, among which they would<br/>naturally seek a retreat, and they could not have been long in<br/>discovering the corral, then uninhabited. There they had regularly<br/>installed themselves, awaiting the moment to put their abominable<br/>schemes into execution. Ayrton's arrival had surprised them, but<br/>they had managed to overpower the unfortunate man, and—the rest may<br/>be easily imagined!<br/><br/>Now, the convicts,—reduced to five, it is true, but well<br/>armed,—were roaming the woods, and to venture there was to expose<br/>themselves to their attacks, which could be neither guarded against<br/>nor prevented.<br/><br/>"Wait! There is nothing else to be done!" repeated Cyrus<br/>Harding. "When Herbert is cured, we can organize a general battle<br/>of the island, and have satisfaction of these convicts. That will<br/>be the object of our grand expedition at the same time—"<br/><br/>"As the search for our mysterious protector," added Gideon<br/>Spilett, finishing the engineer's sentence. "An, it must be<br/>acknowledged, my dear Cyrus, that this time his protection was<br/>wanting at the very moment when it was most necessary to us!"<br/><br/>"Who knows?" replied the engineer.<br/><br/>
