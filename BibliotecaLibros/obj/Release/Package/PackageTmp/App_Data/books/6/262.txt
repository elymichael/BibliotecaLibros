The engineer remarked this; but although he carefully examined
these points by the light of his lantern, he could find no
impression, no fracture which could give any reason to suppose that
they had either recently or at any former time been used as a
staircase. Cyrus Harding descended deeper, throwing the light of
his lantern on all sides.

He saw nothing suspicious.

When the engineer had reached the last rounds he came upon the
water, which was then perfectly calm. Neither at its level nor in
any other part of the well, did any passage open, which could lead
to the interior of the cliff. The wall which Harding struck with
the hilt of his cutlass sounded solid. It was compact granite,
through which no living being could force a way. To arrive at the
bottom of the well and then climb up to its mouth it was necessary
to pass through the channel under the rocky subsoil of the beach,
which placed it in communication with the sea, and this was only
possible for marine animals. As to the question of knowing where
this channel ended, at what point of the shore, and at what depth
beneath the water, it could not be answered.

Then Cyrus Harding, having ended his survey, re-ascended, drew
up the ladder, covered the mouth of the well, and returned
thoughtfully to the diningroom, saying to himself,â€”

"I have seen nothing, and yet there is something there!"
