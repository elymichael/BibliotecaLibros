<br/>"In half an hour we shall be certain about that," answered the<br/>reporter. "Besides, it is very evident that the intention of the<br/>captain of this ship is to land, and, consequently, if not today,<br/>to-morrow at the latest, we shall make his acquaintance."<br/><br/>"Never mind!" said Pencroft. "It is best to know whom we have to<br/>deal with, and I shall not be sorry to recognize that fellow's<br/>colors!"<br/><br/>And, while thus speaking, the sailor never left the glass. The<br/>day began to fade, and with the day the breeze fell also. The<br/>brig's ensign hung in folds, and it became more and more difficult<br/>to observe it.<br/><br/>"It is not the American flag," said Pencroft from time to time,<br/>"nor the English, the red of which could be easily seen, nor the<br/>French or German colors, nor the white flag of Russia, nor the<br/>yellow of Spain. One would say it was all one color. Let's see: in<br/>these seas, what do we generally meet with? The Chilean flag?—but<br/>that is tri-color. Brazilian?—it is green. Japanese?—it is yellow<br/>and black, while this—"<br/><br/>At that moment the breeze blew out the unknown flag. Ayrton<br/>seizing the telescope which the sailor had put down, put it to his<br/>eye, and in a hoarse voice,—<br/><br/>"The black flag!" he exclaimed.<br/><br/>And indeed the somber bunting was floating from the mast of the<br/>brig, and they had now good reason for considering her to be a<br/>suspicious vessel!<br/><br/>Had the engineer, then, been right in his presentiments? Was<br/>this a pirate vessel? Did she scour the Pacific, competing with the<br/>Malay proas which still infest it? For what had she come to look at<br/>the shores of Lincoln Island? Was it to them an unknown island,<br/>ready to become a magazine for stolen cargoes? Had she come to find<br/>on the coast a sheltered port for the winter months? Was the<br/>settlers' honest domain destined to be transformed into an infamous<br/>refuge—the headquarters of the piracy of the Pacific?<br/><br/>All these ideas instinctively presented themselves to the<br/>colonists' imaginations. There was no doubt, besides, of the<br/>signification which must be attached to the color of the hoisted<br/>flag. It was that of pirates! It was that which the "Duncan" would<br/>have carried, had the convicts succeeded in their criminal design!<br/>No time was lost before discussing it.<br/><br/>"My friends," said Cyrus Harding, "perhaps this vessel only<br/>wishes to survey the coast of the island. Perhaps her crew will not<br/>land. There is a chance of it. However that may be, we ought to do<br/>everything we can to hide our presence here. The windmill on<br/>Prospect Heights is too easily seen. Let Ayrton and Neb go and take<br/>down the sails. We must also conceal the windows of Granite House<br/>with thick branches. All the fires must be extinguished, so that<br/>nothing may betray the presence of men on the island."<br/><br/>
