The next day, the 16th of April, and Easter Sunday, the settlers
issued from the Chimneys at daybreak, and proceeded to wash their
linen. The engineer intended to manufacture soap as soon as he
could procure the necessary materialsâ€”soda or potash, fat or oil.
The important question of renewing their wardrobe would be treated
of in the proper time and place. At any rate their clothes would
last at least six months longer, for they were strong, and could
resist the wear of manual labor. But all would depend on the
situation of the island with regard to inhabited land. This would
be settled to-day if the weather permitted.

The sun rising above a clear horizon, announced a magnificent
day, one of those beautiful autumn days which are like the last
farewells of the warm season.

It was now necessary to complete the observations of the evening
before by measuring the height of the cliff above the level of the
sea.

"Shall you not need an instrument similar to the one which you
used yesterday?" said Herbert to the engineer.

"No, my boy," replied the latter, "we are going to proceed
differently, but in as precise a way."

Herbert, wishing to learn everything he could, followed the
engineer to the beach. Pencroft, Neb, and the reporter remained
behind and occupied themselves in different ways.
