<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>21<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>From this time Pencroft did not let a single day pass without<br/>going to visit what he gravely called his "corn-field." And woe to<br/>the insects which dared to venture there! No mercy was shown<br/>them.<br/><br/>Towards the end of the month of June, after incessant rain, the<br/>weather became decidedly colder, and on the 29th a Fahrenheit<br/>thermometer would certainly have announced only twenty degrees<br/>above zero, that is considerably below the freezing-point. The next<br/>day, the 30th of June, the day which corresponds to the 31st of<br/>December in the northern year, was a Friday. Neb remarked that the<br/>year finished on a bad day, but Pencroft replied that naturally the<br/>next would begin on a good one, which was better.<br/><br/>At any rate it commenced by very severe cold. Ice accumulated at<br/>the mouth of the Mercy, and it was not long before the whole<br/>expanse of the lake was frozen.<br/><br/>The settlers had frequently been obliged to renew their store of<br/>wood. Pencroft also had wisely not waited till the river was<br/>frozen, but had brought enormous rafts of wood to their<br/>destination. The current was an indefatigable moving power, and it<br/>was employed in conveying the floating wood to the moment when the<br/>frost enchained it. To the fuel which was so abundantly supplied by<br/>the forest, they added several cartloads of coal, which had to be<br/>brought from the foot of the spurs of Mount Franklin. The powerful<br/>heat of the coal was greatly appreciated in the low temperature,<br/>which on the 4th of July fell to eight degrees of Fahrenheit, that<br/>is, thirteen degrees below zero. A second fireplace had been<br/>established in the dining-room, where they all worked together at<br/>their different avocations. During this period of cold, Cyrus<br/>Harding had great cause to congratulate himself on having brought<br/>to Granite House the little stream of water from Lake Grant. Taken<br/>below the frozen surface, and conducted through the passage, it<br/>preserved its fluidity, and arrived at an interior reservoir which<br/>had been hollowed out at the back part of the storeroom, while the<br/>overflow ran through the well to the sea.<br/><br/>About this time, the weather being extremely dry, the colonists,<br/>clothed as warmly as possible, resolved to devote a day to the<br/>exploration of that part of the island between the Mercy and Claw<br/>Cape. It was a wide extent of marshy land, and they would probably<br/>find good sport, for water-birds ought to swarm there.<br/><br/>They reckoned that it would be about eight or nine miles to go<br/>there, and as much to return, so that the whole of the day would be<br/>occupied. As an unknown part of the island was about to be<br/>explored, the whole colony took part in the expedition.<br/>Accordingly, on the 5th of July, at six o'clock in the morning,<br/>when day had scarcely broken, Cyrus Harding, Gideon Spilett,<br/>Herbert, Neb, and Pencroft, armed with spears, snares, bows and<br/>arrows, and provided with provisions, left Granite House, preceded<br/>by Top, who bounded before them.<br/><br/>
