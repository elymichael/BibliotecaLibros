The colonists listened reverently to the words of the dying
man.

"To-morrow, after my death, Mr. Harding," continued the captain,
"yourself and companions will leave the 'Nautilus,' for all the
treasures it contains must perish with me. One token alone will
remain with you of Prince Dakkar, with whose history you are now
acquainted. That coffer yonder contains diamonds of the value of
many millions, most of them mementoes of the time when, husband and
father, I thought happiness possible for me, and a collection of
pearls gathered by my friends and myself in the depths of the
ocean. Of this treasure at a future day, you may make good use. In
the hands of such men as yourself and your comrades, Captain
Harding, money will never be a source of danger. From on high I
shall still participate in your enterprises, and I fear not but
that they will prosper."

After a few moments' repose, necessitated by his extreme
weakness, Captain Nemo continued,—

"To-morrow you will take the coffer, you will leave the saloon,
of which you will close the door; then you will ascend on to the
deck of the 'Nautilus,' and you will lower the mainhatch so as
entirely to close the vessel."

"It shall be done, captain," answered Cyrus Harding.

"Good. You will then embark in the canoe which brought you
hither; but, before leaving the 'Nautilus,' go to the stern and
there open two large stop-cocks which you will find upon the
water-line. The water will penetrate into the reservoirs, and the
'Nautilus' will gradually sink beneath the water to repose at the
bottom of the abyss."

And comprehending a gesture of Cyrus Harding, the captain
added,—

"Fear nothing! You will but bury a corpse!"

Neither Cyrus Harding nor his companions ventured to offer any
observation to Captain Nemo. He had expressed his last wishes, and
they had nothing to do but to conform to them.

"I have your promise, gentlemen?" added Captain Nemo.

"You have, captain," replied the engineer.
