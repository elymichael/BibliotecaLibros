"Captain Harding, I ask<br/>this as a favor. Perhaps it will be a means of raising me in my own<br/>eyes!"<br/><br/>"Go, Ayrton," replied the engineer, who felt sure that a refusal<br/>would have deeply wounded the former convict, now become an honest<br/>man.<br/><br/>"I will accompany you," said Pencroft.<br/><br/>"You mistrust me!" said Ayrton quickly.<br/><br/>Then more humbly,â€”<br/><br/>"Alas!"<br/><br/>"No! no!" exclaimed Harding with animation, "no, Ayrton,<br/>Pencroft does not mistrust you. You interpret his words<br/>wrongly."<br/><br/>"Indeed," returned the sailor, "I only propose to accompany<br/>Ayrton as far as the islet. It may be, although it is scarcely<br/>possible, that one of these villains has landed, and in that case<br/>two men will not be too many to hinder him from giving the alarm. I<br/>will wait for Ayrton on the islet, and he shall go alone to the<br/>vessel, since he has proposed to do so." These things agreed to,<br/>Ayrton made preparations for his departure. His plan was bold, but<br/>it might succeed, thanks to the darkness of the night. Once arrived<br/>at the vessel's side, Ayrton, holding on to the main chains, might<br/>reconnoiter the number and perhaps overhear the intentions of the<br/>pirates.<br/><br/>
