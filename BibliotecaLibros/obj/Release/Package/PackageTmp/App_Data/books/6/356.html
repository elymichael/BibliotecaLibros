<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>It was now two years and a half since the castaways from the<br/>balloon had been thrown on Lincoln Island, and during that period<br/>there had been no communication between them and their<br/>fellow-creatures. Once the reporter had attempted to communicate<br/>with the inhabited world by confiding to a bird a letter which<br/>contained the secret of their situation, but that was a chance on<br/>which it was impossible to reckon seriously. Ayrton, alone, under<br/>the circumstances which have been related, had come to join the<br/>little colony. Now, suddenly, on this day, the 17th of October,<br/>other men had unexpectedly appeared in sight of the island, on that<br/>deserted sea!<br/><br/>There could be no doubt about it! A vessel was there! But would<br/>she pass on, or would she put into port? In a few hours the<br/>colonists would definitely know what to expect.<br/><br/>Cyrus Harding and Herbert having immediately called Gideon<br/>Spilett, Pencroft, and Neb into the dining-room of Granite House,<br/>told them what had happened. Pencroft, seizing the telescope,<br/>rapidly swept the horizon, and stopping on the indicated point,<br/>that is to say, on that which had made the almost imperceptible<br/>spot on the photographic negative,â€”<br/><br/>"I'm blessed but it is really a vessel!" he exclaimed, in a<br/>voice which did not express any great amount of satisfaction.<br/><br/>"Is she coming here?" asked Gideon Spilett.<br/><br/>"Impossible to say anything yet," answered Pencroft, "for her<br/>rigging alone is above the horizon, and not a bit of her hull can<br/>be seen."<br/><br/>
