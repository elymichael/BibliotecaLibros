"What's the matter?" asked the engineer.

"A light!"

"In the house?"

"Yes!"

All five advanced and indeed, through the window fronting them,
they saw glimmering a feeble light. Cyrus Harding made up his mind
rapidly. "It is our only chance," said he to his companions, "of
finding the convicts collected in this house, suspecting nothing!
They are in our power! Forward!" The colonists crossed through the
enclosure, holding their guns ready in their hands. The cart had
been left outside under the charge of Jup and Top, who had been
prudently tied to it.

Cyrus Harding, Pencroft, and Gideon Spilett on one side, Herbert
and Neb on the other, going along by the palisade, surveyed the
absolutely dark and deserted corral.

In a few moments they were near the closed door of the
house.

Harding signed to his companions not to stir, and approached the
window, then feebly lighted by the inner light.

He gazed into the apartment.

On the table burned a lantern. Near the table was the bed
formerly used by Ayrton.
