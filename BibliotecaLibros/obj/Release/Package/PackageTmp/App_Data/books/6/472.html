Pencroft and Ayrton, the most zealous workmen at the new vessel,<br/>pursued their labor as long as they could. They were not men to<br/>mind the wind tearing at their hair, nor the rain wetting them to<br/>the skin, and a blow from a hammer is worth just as much in bad as<br/>in fine weather. But when a severe frost succeeded this wet period,<br/>the wood, its fibers acquiring the hardness of iron, became<br/>extremely difficult to work, and about the 10th of June<br/>shipbuilding was obliged to be entirely discontinued.<br/><br/>Cyrus Harding and his companions had not omitted to observe how<br/>severe was the temperature during the winters of Lincoln Island.<br/>The cold was comparable to that experienced in the States of New<br/>England, situated at almost the same distance from the equator. In<br/>the northern hemisphere, or at any rate in the part occupied by<br/>British America and the north of the United States, this phenomenon<br/>is explained by the flat conformation of the territories bordering<br/>on the pole, and on which there is no intumescence of the soil to<br/>oppose any obstacle to the north winds; here, in Lincoln Island,<br/>this explanation would not suffice.<br/><br/>"It has even been observed," remarked Harding one day to his<br/>companions, "that in equal latitudes the islands and coast regions<br/>are less tried by the cold than inland countries. I have often<br/>heard it asserted that the winters of Lombardy, for example, are<br/>not less rigorous than those of Scotland, which results from the<br/>sea restoring during the winter the heat which it received during<br/>the summer. Islands are, therefore, in a better situation for<br/>benefiting by this restitution."<br/><br/>"But then, Captain Harding," asked Herbert, "why does Lincoln<br/>Island appear to escape the common law?"<br/><br/>"That is difficult to explain," answered the engineer. "However,<br/>I should be disposed to conjecture that this peculiarity results<br/>from the situation of the island in the Southern Hemisphere, which,<br/>as you know, my boy, is colder than the Northern Hemisphere."<br/><br/>"Yes," said Herbert, "and icebergs are met with in lower<br/>latitudes in the south than in the north of the Pacific."<br/><br/>"That is true," remarked Pencroft, "and when I have been serving<br/>on board whalers I have seen icebergs off Cape Horn."<br/><br/>"The severe cold experienced in Lincoln Island," said Gideon<br/>Spilett, "may then perhaps be explained by the presence of floes or<br/>icebergs comparatively near to Lincoln Island."<br/><br/>"Your opinion is very admissible indeed, my dear Spilett,"<br/>answered Cyrus Harding, "and it is evidently to the proximity of<br/>icebergs that we owe our rigorous winters. I would draw your<br/>attention also to an entirely physical cause, which renders the<br/>Southern colder than the Northern Hemisphere. In fact, since the<br/>sun is nearer to this hemisphere during the summer, it is<br/>necessarily more distant during the winter. This explains then the<br/>excess of temperature in the two seasons, for, if we find the<br/>winters very cold in Lincoln Island, we must not forget that the<br/>summers here, on the contrary, are very hot."<br/><br/>"But why, if you please, captain," asked Pencroft, knitting his<br/>brows, "why should our hemisphere, as you say, be so badly divided?<br/>It isn't just, that!"<br/><br/>"Friend Pencroft," answered the engineer, laughing, "whether<br/>just or not, we must submit to it, and here lies the reason for<br/>this peculiarity. The earth does not describe a circle around the<br/>sun, but an ellipse, as it must by the laws of rational mechanics.<br/>Now, the earth occupies one of the foci of the ellipse, and so at<br/>one point in its course is at its apogee, that is, at its farthest<br/>from the sun, and at another point it is at its perigee, or nearest<br/>to the sun. Now it happens that it is during the winter of the<br/>southern countries that it is at its most distant point from the<br/>sun, and consequently, in a situation for those regions to feel the<br/>greatest cold. Nothing can be done to prevent that, and men,<br/>Pencroft, however learned they may be, can never change anything of<br/>the cosmographical order established by God Himself."<br/>
