"And consequently an area?"

"That is difficult to estimate," replied the engineer, "for it
is so uneven."

If Cyrus Harding was not mistaken in his calculation, the island
had almost the extent of Malta or Zante, in the Mediterranean, but
it was at the same time much more irregular and less rich in capes,
promontories, points, bays, or creeks. Its strange form caught the
eye, and when Gideon Spilett, on the engineer's advice, had drawn
the outline, they found that it resembled some fantastic animal, a
monstrous leviathan, which lay sleeping on the surface of the
Pacific.

This was in fact the exact shape of the island, which it is of
consequence to know, and a tolerably correct map of it was
immediately drawn by the reporter.

The east part of the shore, where the castaways had landed,
formed a wide bay, terminated by a sharp cape, which had been
concealed by a high point from Pencroft on his first exploration.
At the northeast two other capes closed the bay, and between them
ran a narrow gulf, which looked like the half-open jaws of a
formidable dog-fish.

From the northeast to the southwest the coast was rounded, like
the flattened cranium of an animal, rising again, forming a sort of
protuberance which did not give any particular shape to this part
of the island, of which the center was occupied by the volcano.

From this point the shore ran pretty regularly north and south,
broken at two-thirds of its perimeter by a narrow creek, from which
it ended in a long tail, similar to the caudal appendage of a
gigantic alligator.

This tail formed a regular peninsula, which stretched more than
thirty miles into the sea, reckoning from the cape southeast of the
island, already mentioned; it curled round, making an open
roadstead, which marked out the lower shore of this
strangely-formed land.

At the narrowest part, that is to say between the Chimneys and
the creek on the western shore, which corresponded to it in
latitude, the island only measured ten miles; but its greatest
length, from the jaws at the northeast to the extremity of the tail
of the southwest, was not less than thirty miles.

As to the interior of the island, its general aspect was this,
very woody throughout the southern part from the mountain to the
shore, and arid and sandy in the northern part. Between the volcano
and the east coast Cyrus Harding and his companions were surprised
to see a lake, bordered with green trees, the existence of which
they had not suspected. Seen from this height, the lake appeared to
be on the same level as the ocean, but, on reflection, the engineer
explained to his companions that the altitude of this little sheet
of water must be about three hundred feet, because the plateau,
which was its basin, was but a prolongation of the coast.
