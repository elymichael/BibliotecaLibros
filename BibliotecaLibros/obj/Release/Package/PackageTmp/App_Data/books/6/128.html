The crystals were placed in pots, and the heat from the furnace<br/>would distil the sulphuric acid. The operation was successfully<br/>completed, and on the 20th of May, twelve days after commencing it,<br/>the engineer was the possessor of the agent which later he hoped to<br/>use in so many different ways.<br/><br/>Now, why did he wish for this agent? Simply to produce azotic<br/>acid; and that was easy, since saltpeter, attacked by sulphuric<br/>acid, gives azotic, or nitric, acid by distillation.<br/><br/>But, after all, how was he going to employ this azotic acid? His<br/>companions were still ignorant of this, for he had not informed<br/>them of the result at which he aimed.<br/><br/>However, the engineer had nearly accomplished his purpose, and<br/>by a last operation he would procure the substance which had given<br/>so much trouble.<br/><br/>Taking some azotic acid, he mixed it with glycerine, which had<br/>been previously concentrated by evaporation, subjected to the<br/>water-bath, and he obtained, without even employing a refrigerant<br/>mixture, several pints of an oily yellow mixture.<br/><br/>This last operation Cyrus Harding had made alone, in a retired<br/>place, at a distance from the Chimneys, for he feared the danger of<br/>an explosion, and when he showed a bottle of this liquid to his<br/>friends, he contented himself with saying,â€”<br/><br/>"Here is nitro-glycerine!"<br/><br/>It was really this terrible production, of which the explosive<br/>power is perhaps tenfold that of ordinary powder, and which has<br/>already caused so many accidents. However, since a way has been<br/>found to transform it into dynamite, that is to say, to mix with it<br/>some solid substance, clay or sugar, porous enough to hold it, the<br/>dangerous liquid has been used with some security. But dynamite was<br/>not yet known at the time when the settlers worked on Lincoln<br/>Island.<br/><br/>"And is it that liquid that is going to blow up our rocks?" said<br/>Pencroft incredulously.<br/><br/>"Yes, my friend," replied the engineer, "and this<br/>nitro-glycerine will produce so much the more effect, as the<br/>granite is extremely hard, and will oppose a greater resistance to<br/>the explosion."<br/><br/>"And when shall we see this, captain?"<br/>
