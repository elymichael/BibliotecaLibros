The settlers rowed round the hull, and in proportion as the tide<br/>went down, they could ascertain, if not the cause which had<br/>occasioned the catastrophe, at least the effect produced.<br/><br/>Towards the bows, on both sides of the keel, seven or eight feet<br/>from the beginning of the stem, the sides of the brig were<br/>frightfully torn. Over a length of at least twenty feet there<br/>opened two large leaks, which would be impossible to stop up. Not<br/>only had the copper sheathing and the planks disappeared, reduced,<br/>no doubt, to powder, but also the ribs, the iron bolts, and<br/>treenalls which united them. From the entire length of the hull to<br/>the stern the false keel had been separated with an unaccountable<br/>violence, and the keel itself, torn from the carline in several<br/>places, was split in all its length.<br/><br/>"I've a notion!" exclaimed Pencroft, "that this vessel will be<br/>difficult to get afloat again."<br/><br/>"It will be impossible," said Ayrton.<br/><br/>"At any rate," observed Gideon Spilett to the sailor, "the<br/>explosion, if there has been one, has produced singular effects! It<br/>has split the lower part of the hull, instead of blowing up the<br/>deck and topsides! These great rents appear rather to have been<br/>made by a rock than by the explosion of a powder-magazine."<br/><br/>"There is not a rock in the channel!" answered the sailor. "I<br/>will admit anything you like, except the rock."<br/><br/>"Let us try to penetrate into the interior of the brig," said<br/>the engineer; "perhaps we shall then know what to think of the<br/>cause of her destruction."<br/><br/>This was the best thing to be done, and it was agreed, besides,<br/>to take an inventory of all the treasures on board, and to arrange<br/>their preservation.<br/><br/>Access to the interior of the brig was now easy. The tide was<br/>still going down and the deck was practicable. The ballast,<br/>composed of heavy masses of iron, had broken through in several<br/>places. The noise of the sea could be heard as it rushed out at the<br/>holes in the hull.<br/><br/>Cyrus Harding and his companions, hatchets in hand, advanced<br/>along the shattered deck. Cases of all sorts encumbered it, and, as<br/>they had been but a very short time in the water, their contents<br/>were perhaps uninjured.<br/><br/>They then busied themselves in placing all this cargo in safety.<br/>The water would not return for several hours, and these hours must<br/>be employed in the most profitable way. Ayrton and Pencroft had, at<br/>the entrance made in the hull, discovered tackle, which would serve<br/>to hoist up the barrels and chests. The boat received them and<br/>transported them to the shore. They took the articles as they came,<br/>intending to sort them afterwards.<br/>
