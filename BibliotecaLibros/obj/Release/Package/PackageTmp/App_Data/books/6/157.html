This ended the conversation. Breakfast was finished, the<br/>exploration was continued, and the settlers arrived at the border<br/>of the marshy region. It was a marsh of which the extent, to the<br/>rounded coast which terminated the island at the southeast, was<br/>about twenty square miles. The soil was formed of clayey<br/>flint-earth, mingled with vegetable matter, such as the remains of<br/>rushes, reeds, grass, etc. Here and there beds of grass, thick as a<br/>carpet, covered it. In many places icy pools sparkled in the sun.<br/>Neither rain nor any river, increased by a sudden swelling, could<br/>supply these ponds. They therefore naturally concluded that the<br/>marsh was fed by the infiltrations of the soil and it was really<br/>so. It was also to be feared that during the heat miasmas would<br/>arise, which might produce fevers.<br/><br/>Above the aquatic plants, on the surface of the stagnant water,<br/>fluttered numbers of birds. Wild duck, teal, snipe lived there in<br/>flocks, and those fearless birds allowed themselves to be easily<br/>approached.<br/><br/>One shot from a gun would certainly have brought down some dozen<br/>of the birds, they were so close together. The explorers were,<br/>however, obliged to content themselves with bows and arrows. The<br/>result was less, but the silent arrow had the advantage of not<br/>frightening the birds, while the noise of firearms would have<br/>dispersed them to all parts of the marsh. The hunters were<br/>satisfied, for this time, with a dozen ducks, which had white<br/>bodies with a band of cinnamon, a green head, wings black, white,<br/>and red, and flattened beak. Herbert called them tadorns. Top<br/>helped in the capture of these birds, whose name was given to this<br/>marshy part of the island. The settlers had here an abundant<br/>reserve of aquatic game. At some future time they meant to explore<br/>it more carefully, and it was probable that some of the birds there<br/>might be domesticated, or at least brought to the shores of the<br/>lake, so that they would be more within their reach.<br/><br/>About five o'clock in the evening Cyrus Harding and his<br/>companions retraced their steps to their dwelling by traversing<br/>Tadorn's Fens, and crossed the Mercy on the ice-bridge.<br/><br/>At eight in the evening they all entered Granite House.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
