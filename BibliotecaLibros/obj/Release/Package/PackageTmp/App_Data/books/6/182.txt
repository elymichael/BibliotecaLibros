It was evident that this chest had been thrown overboard from
some dismasted vessel driven towards the island, and that, in the
hope that it would reach the land, where they might afterwards find
it, the passengers had taken the precaution to buoy it up by means
of this floating apparatus.

"We will tow this chest to Granite House," said the engineer,
"where we can make an inventory of its contents; then, if we
discover any of the survivors from the supposed wreck, we can
return it to those to whom it belongs. If we find no one—"

"We will keep it for ourselves!" cried Pencroft. "But what in
the world can there be in it?"

The sea was already approaching the chest, and the high tide
would evidently float it. One of the ropes which fastened the
barrels was partly unlashed and used as a cable to unite the
floating apparatus with the canoe. Pencroft and Neb then dug away
the sand with their oars, so as to facilitate the moving of the
chest, towing which the boat soon began to double the point, to
which the name of Flotsam Point was given.

The chest was heavy, and the barrels were scarcely sufficient to
keep it above water. The sailor also feared every instant that it
would get loose and sink to the bottom of the sea. But happily his
fears were not realized, and an hour and a half after they set
out—all that time had been taken up in going a distance of three
miles—the boat touched the beach below Granite House.

Canoe and chest were then hauled up on the sands; and as the
tide was then going out, they were soon left high and dry. Neb,
hurrying home, brought back some tools with which to open the chest
in such a way that it might be injured as little as possible, and
they proceeded to its inventory. Pencroft did not try to hide that
he was greatly excited.

The sailor began by detaching the two barrels, which, being in
good condition, would of course be of use. Then the locks were
forced with a cold chisel and hammer, and the lid thrown back. A
second casing of zinc lined the interior of the chest, which had
been evidently arranged that the articles which it enclosed might
under any circumstances be sheltered from damp.

"Oh!" cried Neb, "suppose it's jam!

"I hope not," replied the reporter.

"If only there was—" said the sailor in a low voice.
