"I hope that it is not so," replied Cyrus Harding, "and that
Heaven has not deprived us of the best chance which remains to
us."

"I think," observed the reporter, "that at any rate we shall
know what we have to depend on when we have been to Tabor Island,
for if the yacht has returned there, they will necessarily have
left some traces of their visit."

"That is evident," answered the engineer. "So then, my friends,
since we have this chance of returning to our country, we must wait
patiently, and if it is taken from us we shall see what will be
best to do."

"At any rate," remarked Pencroft, "it is well understood that if
we do leave Lincoln Island, it will not be because we were
uncomfortable there!"

"No, Pencroft," replied the engineer, "it will be because we are
far from all that a man holds dearest in the world, his family, his
friends, his native land!"

Matters being thus decided, the building of a vessel large
enough to sail either to the Archipelagoes in the north, or to New
Zealand in the west, was no longer talked of, and they busied
themselves in their accustomed occupations, with a view to
wintering a third time in Granite House.

However, it was agreed that before the stormy weather came on,
their little vessel should be employed in making a voyage round the
island. A complete survey of the coast had not yet been made, and
the colonists had but an imperfect idea of the shore to the west
and north, from the mouth of Falls River to the Mandible Capes, as
well as of the narrow bay between them, which opened like a shark's
jaws.

The plan of this excursion was proposed by Pencroft, and Cyrus
Harding fully acquiesced in it, for he himself wished to see this
part of his domain.

The weather was variable, but the barometer did not fluctuate by
sudden movements, and they could therefore count on tolerable
weather. However, during the first week of April, after a sudden
barometrical fall, a renewed rise was marked by a heavy gale of
wind, lasting five or six days; then the needle of the instrument
remained stationary at a height of twenty-nine inches and
nine-tenths, and the weather appeared propitious for an
excursion.

The departure was fixed for the 16th of April, and the
"Bonadventure," anchored in Port Balloon, was provisioned for a
voyage which might be of some duration.

Cyrus Harding informed Ayrton of the projected expedition, and
proposed that he should take part in it, but Ayrton preferring to
remain on shore, it was decided that he should come to Granite
House during the absence of his companions. Master Jup was ordered
to keep him company, and made no remonstrance.
