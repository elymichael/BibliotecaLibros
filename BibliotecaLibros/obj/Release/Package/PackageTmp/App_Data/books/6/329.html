"It can only be explained in that way, my friends," replied<br/>Harding quickly, "and I understand now how Ayrton was able to point<br/>out exactly the situation of Tabor Island, since the events which<br/>had preceded his being left on the island had made it known to<br/>him."<br/><br/>"However," observed Pencroft, "if he was not yet a brute when he<br/>wrote that document, and if he threw it into the sea seven or eight<br/>years ago, how is it that the paper has not been injured by<br/>damp?"<br/><br/>"That proves," answered Cyrus Harding, "that Ayrton was deprived<br/>of intelligence at a more recent time than he thinks."<br/><br/>"Of course it must be so," replied Pencroft, "without that the<br/>fact would be unaccountable."<br/><br/>"Unaccountable indeed," answered the engineer, who did not<br/>appear desirous to prolong the conversation.<br/><br/>"But has Ayrton told the truth?" asked the sailor.<br/><br/>"Yes," replied the reporter. "The story which he has told is<br/>true in every point. I remember quite well the account in the<br/>newspapers of the yacht expedition undertaken by Lord Glenarvan,<br/>and its result."<br/><br/>"Ayrton has told the truth," added Harding. "Do not doubt it,<br/>Pencroft, for it was painful to him. People tell the truth when<br/>they accuse themselves like that!"<br/><br/>The next day—the 21st of December—the colonists descended to the<br/>beach, and having climbed the plateau they found nothing of Ayrton.<br/>He had reached his house in the corral during the night and the<br/>settlers judged it best not to agitate him by their presence. Time<br/>would doubtless perform what sympathy had been unable to<br/>accomplish.<br/><br/>Herbert, Pencroft, and Neb resumed their ordinary occupations.<br/>On this day the same work brought Harding and the reporter to the<br/>workshop at the Chimneys.<br/><br/>"Do you know, my dear Cyrus," said Gideon Spilett, "that the<br/>explanation you gave yesterday on the subject of the bottle has not<br/>satisfied me at all! How can it be supposed that the unfortunate<br/>man was able to write that document and throw the bottle into the<br/>sea without having the slightest recollection of it?"<br/>
