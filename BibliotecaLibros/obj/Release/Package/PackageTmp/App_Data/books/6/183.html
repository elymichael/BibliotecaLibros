"What?" asked Neb, who overheard him.<br/><br/>"Nothing!"<br/><br/>The covering of zinc was torn off and thrown back over the sides<br/>of the chest, and by degrees numerous articles of very varied<br/>character were produced and strewn about on the sand. At each new<br/>object Pencroft uttered fresh hurrahs, Herbert clapped his hands,<br/>and Neb danced up and down. There were books which made Herbert<br/>wild with joy, and cooking utensils which Neb covered with<br/>kisses!<br/><br/>In short, the colonists had reason to be extremely satisfied,<br/>for this chest contained tools, weapons, instruments, clothes,<br/>books; and this is the exact list of them as stated in Gideon<br/>Spilett's note-book:<br/><br/>—Tools:—3 knives with several blades, 2 woodmen's axes, 2<br/>carpenter's hatchets, 3 planes, 2 adzes, 1 twibil or mattock, 6<br/>chisels, 2 files, 3 hammers, 3 gimlets, 2 augers, 10 bags of nails<br/>and screws, 3 saws of different sizes, 2 boxes of needles.<br/><br/>Weapons:—2 flint-lock guns, 2 for percussion caps, 2<br/>breach-loader carbines, 5 boarding cutlasses, 4 sabers, 2 barrels<br/>of powder, each containing twenty-five pounds; 12 boxes of<br/>percussion caps.<br/><br/>Instruments:—1 sextant, 1 double opera-glass, 1 telescope, 1 box<br/>of mathematical instruments, 1 mariner's compass, 1 Fahrenheit<br/>thermometer, 1 aneroid barometer, 1 box containing a photographic<br/>apparatus, object-glass, plates, chemicals, etc.<br/><br/>Clothes:-2 dozen shirts of a peculiar material resembling wool,<br/>but evidently of a vegetable origin; 3 dozen stockings of the same<br/>material.<br/><br/>Utensils:-1 iron pot, 6 copper saucepans, 3 iron dishes, 10<br/>metal plates, 2 kettles, 1 portable stove, 6 table-knives,<br/><br/>Books:-1 Bible, 1 atlas, 1 dictionary of the different<br/>Polynesian idioms, 1 dictionary of natural science, in six volumes;<br/>3 reams of white paper, 2 books with blank pages.<br/><br/>"It must be allowed," said the reporter, after the inventory had<br/>been made, "that the owner of this chest was a practical man!<br/>Tools, weapons, instruments, clothes, utensils, books—nothing is<br/>wanting! It might really be said that he expected to be wrecked,<br/>and had prepared for it beforehand."<br/>
