Pencroft's first care, after unloading the raft, was to render
the cave habitable by stopping up all the holes which made it
draughty. Sand, stones, twisted branches, wet clay, closed up the
galleries open to the south winds. One narrow and winding opening
at the side was kept, to lead out the smoke and to make the fire
draw. The cave was thus divided into three or four rooms, if such
dark dens with which a donkey would scarcely have been contented
deserved the name. But they were dry, and there was space to stand
upright, at least in the principal room, which occupied the center.
The floor was covered with fine sand, and taking all in all they
were well pleased with it for want of a better.

"Perhaps," said Herbert, while he and Pencroft were working,
"our companions have found a superior place to ours."

"Very likely," replied the seaman; "but, as we don't know, we
must work all the same. Better to have two strings to one's bow
than no string at all!"

"Oh!" exclaimed Herbert, "how jolly it will be if they were to
find Captain Harding and were to bring him back with them!"

"Yes, indeed!" said Pencroft, "that was a man of the right
sort."

"Was!" exclaimed Herbert, "do you despair of ever seeing him
again?"
