But they had not made fifty steps in this direction, when they
heard the dog barking furiously.

And all rushed down the bank again.

Arrived at the turning, they saw that the situation had
changed.

In fact, the apes, seized with a sudden panic, from some unknown
cause, were trying to escape. Two or three ran and clambered from
one window to another with the agility of acrobats. They were not
even trying to replace the ladder, by which it would have been easy
to descend; perhaps in their terror they had forgotten this way of
escape. The colonists, now being able to take aim without
difficulty, fired. Some, wounded or killed, fell back into the
rooms, uttering piercing cries. The rest, throwing themselves out,
were dashed to pieces in their fall, and in a few minutes, so far
as they knew, there was not a living quadrumana in Granite
House.

At this moment the ladder was seen to slip over the threshold,
then unroll and fall to the ground.

"Hullo!" cried the sailor, "this is queer!"

"Very strange!" murmured the engineer, leaping first up the
ladder.

"Take care, captain!" cried Pencroft, "perhaps there are still
some of these rascals.

"We shall soon see," replied the engineer, without stopping
however.

All his companions followed him, and in a minute they had
arrived at the threshold. They searched everywhere. There was no
one in the rooms nor in the storehouse, which had been respected by
the band of quadrumana.
