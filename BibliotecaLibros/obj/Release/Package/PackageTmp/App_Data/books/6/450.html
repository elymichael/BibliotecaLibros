"I am of Cyrus' opinion," said the reporter, "and I think that<br/>it is among the spurs of Mount Franklin that the convicts will have<br/>made their lair."<br/><br/>"Then, captain, straight to the corral!" cried Pencroft. "We<br/>must finish them off, and till now we have only lost time!"<br/><br/>"No, my friend," replied the engineer; "you forget that we have<br/>a reason for wishing to know if the forests of the Far West do not<br/>contain some habitation. Our exploration has a double object,<br/>Pencroft. If, on the one hand, we have to chastise crime, we have,<br/>on the other, an act of gratitude to perform."<br/><br/>"That was well said, captain," replied the sailor, "but, all the<br/>same, it is my opinion that we shall not find the gentleman until<br/>he pleases."<br/><br/>And truly Pencroft only expressed the opinion of all. It was<br/>probable that the stranger's retreat was not less mysterious than<br/>was he himself.<br/><br/>That evening the cart halted at the mouth of Falls River. The<br/>camp was organized as usual, and the customary precautions were<br/>taken for the night. Herbert, become again the healthy and vigorous<br/>lad he was before his illness, derived great benefit from this life<br/>in the open air, between the sea breezes and the vivifying air from<br/>the forests. His place was no longer in the cart, but at the head<br/>of the troop.<br/><br/>The next day, the 19th of February, the colonists, leaving the<br/>shore, where, beyond the mouth, basalts of every shape were so<br/>picturesquely piled up, ascended the river by its left bank. The<br/>road had been already partly cleared in their former excursions<br/>made from the corral to the west coast. The settlers were now about<br/>six miles from Mount Franklin.<br/><br/>The engineer's plan was this:—To minutely survey the valley<br/>forming the bed of the river, and to cautiously approach the<br/>neighborhood of the corral; if the corral was occupied, to seize it<br/>by force; if it was not, to entrench themselves there and make it<br/>the center of the operations which had for their object the<br/>exploration of Mount Franklin.<br/><br/>This plan was unanimously approved by the colonists, for they<br/>were impatient to regain entire possession of their island.<br/><br/>They made their way then along the narrow valley separating two<br/>of the largest spurs of Mount Franklin. The trees, crowded on the<br/>river's bank, became rare on the upper slopes of the mountain. The<br/>ground was hilly and rough, very suitable for ambushes, and over<br/>which they did not venture without extreme precaution. Top and Jup<br/>skirmished on the flanks, springing right and left through the<br/>thick brushwood, and emulating each other in intelligence and<br/>activity. But nothing showed that the banks of the stream had been<br/>recently frequented—nothing announced either the presence or the<br/>proximity of the convicts. Towards five in the evening the cart<br/>stopped nearly 600 feet from the palisade. A semicircular screen of<br/>trees still hid it.<br/><br/>It was necessary to reconnoiter the corral, in order to<br/>ascertain if it was occupied. To go there openly, in broad<br/>daylight, when the convicts were probably in ambush, would be to<br/>expose themselves, as poor Herbert had done, to the firearms of the<br/>ruffians. It was better, then, to wait until night came on.<br/>
