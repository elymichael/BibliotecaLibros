Top was recalled by a slight whistle from his master, and the
latter, signing to his companions to wait for him, glided away
among the rocks. The colonists, motionless, anxiously awaited the
result of this exploration, when a shout from the engineer made
them hasten forward. They soon joined him, and were at once struck
with a disagreeable odor which impregnated the atmosphere.

The odor, easily recognized, was enough for the engineer to
guess what the smoke was which at first, not without cause, had
startled him.

"This fue," said he, "or rather, this smoke is produced by
nature alone. There is a sulphur spring there, which will cure all
our sore throats."

"Captain!" cried Pencroft. "What a pity that I haven't got a
cold!"

The settlers then directed their steps towards the place from
which the smoke escaped. They there saw a sulphur spring which
flowed abundantly between the rocks, and its waters discharged a
strong sulphuric acid odor, after having absorbed the oxygen of the
air.

Cyrus Harding, dipping in his hand, felt the water oily to the
touch. He tasted it and found it rather sweet. As to its
temperature, that he estimated at ninety-five degrees Fahrenheit.
Herbert having asked on what he based this calculation,â€”

"Its quite simple, my boy," said he, "for, in plunging my hand
into the water, I felt no sensation either of heat or cold.
Therefore it has the same temperature as the human body, which is
about ninety-five degrees."

The sulphur spring not being of any actual use to the settlers,
they proceeded towards the thick border of the forest, which began
some hundred paces off.

There, as they had conjectured, the waters of the stream flowed
clear and limpid between high banks of red earth, the color of
which betrayed the presence of oxide of iron. From this color, the
name of Red Creek was immediately given to the watercourse.

It was only a large stream, deep and clear, formed of the
mountain water, which, half river, half torrent, here rippling
peacefully over the sand, there falling against the rocks or
dashing down in a cascade, ran towards the lake, over a distance of
a mile and a half, its breadth varying from thirty to forty feet.
Its waters were sweet, and it was supposed that those of the lake
were so also. A fortunate circumstance, in the event of their
finding on its borders a more suitable dwelling than the
Chimneys.

As to the trees, which some hundred feet downwards shaded the
banks of the creek, they belonged, for the most part, to the
species which abound in the temperate zone of America and Tasmania,
and no longer to those coniferae observed in that portion of the
island already explored to some miles from Prospect Heights. At
this time of the year, the commencement of the month of April,
which represents the month of October, in this hemisphere, that is,
the beginning of autumn, they were still in full leaf. They
consisted principally of casuarinas and eucalypti, some of which
next year would yield a sweet manna, similar to the manna of the
East. Clumps of Australian cedars rose on the sloping banks, which
were also covered with the high grass called "tussac" in New
Holland; but the cocoanut, so abundant in the archipelagoes of the
Pacific, seemed to be wanting in the island, the latitude,
doubtless, being too low.
