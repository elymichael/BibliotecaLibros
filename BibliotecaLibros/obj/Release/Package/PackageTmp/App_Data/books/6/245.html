<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>10<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>When Pencroft had once got a plan in his head, he had no peace<br/>till it was executed. Now he wished to visit Tabor Island, and as a<br/>boat of a certain size was necessary for this voyage, he determined<br/>to build one.<br/><br/>What wood should he employ? Elm or fir, both of which abounded<br/>in the island? They decided for the fir, as being easy to work, but<br/>which stands water as well as the elm.<br/><br/>These details settled, it was agreed that since the fine season<br/>would not return before six months, Cyrus Harding and Pencroft<br/>should work alone at the boat. Gideon Spilett and Herbert were to<br/>continue to hunt, and neither Neb nor Master Jup, his assistant,<br/>were to leave the domestic duties which had devolved upon them.<br/><br/>Directly the trees were chosen, they were felled, stripped of<br/>their branches, and sawn into planks as well as sawyers would have<br/>been able to do it. A week after, in the recess between the<br/>Chimneys and the cliff, a dockyard was prepared, and a keel<br/>five-and-thirty feet long, furnished with a stern-post at the stern<br/>and a stem at the bows, lay along the sand.<br/><br/>Cyrus Harding was not working in the dark at this new trade. He<br/>knew as much about ship-building as about nearly everything else,<br/>and he had at first drawn the model of his ship on paper. Besides,<br/>he was ably seconded by Pencroft, who, having worked for several<br/>years in a dockyard in Brooklyn, knew the practical part of the<br/>trade. It was not until after careful calculation and deep thought<br/>that the timbers were laid on the keel.<br/><br/>Pencroft, as may be believed, was all eagerness to carry out his<br/>new enterprise, and would not leave his work for an instant.<br/><br/>
