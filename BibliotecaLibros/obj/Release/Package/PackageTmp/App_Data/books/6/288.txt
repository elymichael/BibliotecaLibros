Twenty minutes after leaving the hut Pencroft and his companions
reached the western coast of the island, and saw the "Bonadventure"
held fast by her anchor, which was buried deep in the sand.

Pencroft could not restrain a sigh of satisfaction. After all
this vessel was his child, and it is the right of fathers to be
often uneasy when there is no occasion for it.

They returned on board, breakfasted, so that it should not be
necessary to dine until very late; then the repast being ended, the
exploration was continued and conducted with the most minute care.
Indeed, it was very probable that the only inhabitant of the island
had perished. It was therefore more for the traces of a dead than
of a living man that Pencroft and his companions searched. But
their searches were vain, and during the half of that day they
sought to no purpose among the thickets of trees which covered the
islet. There was then scarcely any doubt that, if the castaway was
dead, no trace of his body now remained, but that some wild beast
had probably devoured it to the last bone.

"We will set off to-morrow at daybreak," said Pencroft to his
two companions, as about two o'clock they were resting for a few
minutes under the shade of a clump of firs.

"I should think that we might without scruple take the utensils
which belonged to the castaway," added Herbert.

"I think so, too," returned Gideon Spilett, "and these arms and
tools will make up the stores of Granite House. The supply of
powder and shot is also most important."

"Yes," replied Pencroft, "but we must not forget to capture a
couple or two of those pigs, of which Lincoln Island is
destitute."

"Nor to gather those seeds," added Herbert, "which will give us
all the vegetables of the Old and the New Worlds."

"Then perhaps it would be best," said the reporter, "to remain a
day longer on Tabor Island, so as to collect all that may be useful
to us."

"No, Mr. Spilett," answered Pencroft, "I will ask you to set off
to-morrow at daybreak. The wind seems to me to be likely to shift
to the west, and after having had a fair wind for coming we shall
have a fair wind for going back."

"Then do not let us lose time," said Herbert, rising.
