It can, therefore, be well understood how injurious this<br/>seclusion in the corral must have been to the colonists.<br/><br/>But if they were compelled to bow before necessity, they did not<br/>do so without impatience.<br/><br/>Once or twice the reporter ventured out into the road and made<br/>the tour of the palisade. Top accompanied him, and Gideon Spilett,<br/>his gun cocked, was ready for any emergency.<br/><br/>He met with no misadventure and found no suspicious traces. His<br/>dog would have warned him of any danger, and, as Top did not bark,<br/>it might be concluded that there was nothing to fear at the moment<br/>at least, and that the convicts were occupied in another part of<br/>the island.<br/><br/>However, on his second sortie, on the 27th of November, Gideon<br/>Spilett, who had ventured a quarter of a mile into the woods,<br/>towards the south of the mountain, remarked that Top scented<br/>something. The dog had no longer his unconcerned manner; he went<br/>backwards and forwards, ferreting among the grass and bushes as if<br/>his smell had revealed some suspicious object to him.<br/><br/>Gideon Spilett followed Top, encouraged him, excited him by his<br/>voice, while keeping a sharp look-out, his gun ready to fire, and<br/>sheltering himself behind the trees. It was not probable that Top<br/>scented the presence of man, for in that case, he would have<br/>announced it by half-uttered, sullen, angry barks. Now, as he did<br/>not growl, it was because danger was neither near nor<br/>approaching.<br/><br/>Nearly five minutes passed thus, Top rummaging, the reporter<br/>following him prudently when, all at once, the dog rushed towards a<br/>thick bush, and drew out a rag.<br/><br/>It was a piece of cloth, stained and torn, which Spilett<br/>immediately brought back to the corral. There it was examined by<br/>the colonists, who found that it was a fragment of Ayrton's<br/>waistcoat, a piece of that felt, manufactured solely by the Granite<br/>House factory.<br/><br/>"You see, Pencroft," observed Harding, "there has been<br/>resistance on the part of the unfortunate Ayrton. The convicts have<br/>dragged him away in spite of himself! Do you still doubt his<br/>honesty?"<br/><br/>"No, captain," answered the sailor, "and I repented of my<br/>suspicion a long time ago! But it seems to me that something may be<br/>learned from the incident."<br/><br/>"What is that?" asked the reporter.<br/>
