Civilization never recedes; the law of necessity ever forces it<br/>onwards. The sepoys were vanquished, and the land of the rajahs of<br/>old fell again under the rule of England.<br/><br/>Prince Dakkar, unable to find that death he courted, returned to<br/>the mountain fastnesses of Bundelkund. There, alone in the world,<br/>overcome by disappointment at the destruction of all his vain<br/>hopes, a prey to profound disgust for all human beings, filled with<br/>hatred of the civilized world, he realized the wreck of his<br/>fortune, assembled some score of his most faithful companions, and<br/>one day disappeared, leaving no trace behind.<br/><br/>Where, then, did he seek that liberty denied him upon the<br/>inhabited earth? Under the waves, in the depths of the ocean, where<br/>none could follow.<br/><br/>The warrior became the man of science. Upon a deserted island of<br/>the Pacific he established his dockyard, and there a submarine<br/>vessel was constructed from his designs. By methods which will at<br/>some future day be revealed he had rendered subservient the<br/>illimitable forces of electricity, which, extracted from<br/>inexhaustible sources, was employed for all the requirements of his<br/>floating equipage, as a moving, lighting, and heating agent. The<br/>sea, with its countless treasures, its myriads of fish, its<br/>numberless wrecks, its enormous mammalia, and not only all that<br/>nature supplied, but also all that man had lost in its depths,<br/>sufficed for every want of the prince and his crewâ€”and thus was his<br/>most ardent desire accomplished, never again to hold communication<br/>with the earth. He named his submarine vessel the "Nautilus,"<br/>called himself simply Captain Nemo, and disappeared beneath the<br/>seas.<br/><br/>During many years this strange being visited every ocean, from<br/>pole to pole. Outcast of the inhabited earth in these unknown<br/>worlds he gathered incalculable treasures. The millions lost in the<br/>Bay of Vigo, in 1702, by the galleons of Spain, furnished him with<br/>a mine of inexhaustible riches which he devoted always,<br/>anonymously, in favor of those nations who fought for the<br/>independence of their country.<br/><br/>(This refers to the resurrection of the Candiotes, who were,<br/>in<br/><br/>fact, largely assisted by Captain Nemo.)<br/><br/>For long, however, he had held no communication with his fellow-<br/>creatures, when, during the night of the 6th of November, 1866,<br/>three men were cast on board his vessel. They were a French<br/>professor, his servant, and a Canadian fisherman. These three men<br/>had been hurled overboard by a collision which had taken place<br/>between the "Nautilus" and the United States frigate "Abraham<br/>Lincoln," which had chased her.<br/><br/>Captain Nemo learned from this professor that the "Nautilus,"<br/>taken now for a gigantic mammal of the whale species, now for a<br/>submarine vessel carrying a crew of pirates, was sought for in<br/>every sea.<br/><br/>He might have returned these three men to the ocean, from whence<br/>chance had brought them in contact with his mysterious existence.<br/>Instead of doing this he kept them prisoners, and during seven<br/>months they were enabled to behold all the wonders of a voyage of<br/>twenty thousand leagues under the sea.<br/><br/>One day, the 22nd of June, 1867, these three men, who knew<br/>nothing of the past history of Captain Nemo, succeeded in escaping<br/>in one of the "Nautilus's" boats. But as at this time the<br/>"Nautilus" was drawn into the vortex of the maelstrom, off the<br/>coast of Norway, the captain naturally believed that the fugitives,<br/>engulfed in that frightful whirlpool, found their death at the<br/>bottom of the abyss. He was unaware that the Frenchman and his two<br/>companions had been miraculously cast on shore, that the fishermen<br/>of the Lofoten Islands had rendered them assistance, and that the<br/>professor, on his return to France, had published that work in<br/>which seven months of the strange and eventful navigation of the<br/>"Nautilus" were narrated and exposed to the curiosity of the<br/>public.<br/>
