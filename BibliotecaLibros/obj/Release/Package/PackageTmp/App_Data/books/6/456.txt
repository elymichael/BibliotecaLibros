On the bed lay the body of a man.

Suddenly Cyrus Harding drew back, and in a hoarse
voice,—"Ayrton!" he exclaimed.

Immediately the door was forced rather than opened, and the
colonists rushed into the room.

Ayrton appeared to be asleep. His countenance showed that he had
long and cruelly suffered. On his wrists and ankles could be seen
great bruises.

Harding bent over him.

"Ayrton!" cried the engineer, seizing the arm of the man whom he
had just found again under such unexpected circumstances.

At this exclamation Ayrton opened his eyes, and, gazing at
Harding, then at the others,—

"You!" he cried, "you?"

"Ayrton! Ayrton!" repeated Harding.

"Where am I?"

"In the house in the corral!"
