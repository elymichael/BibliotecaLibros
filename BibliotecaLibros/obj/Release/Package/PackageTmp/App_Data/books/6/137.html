<br/>Pencroft attacked the granite, and for half an hour, by the<br/>light of the torches, he made the splinters fly around him. Neb<br/>relieved him, then Spilett took Neb's place.<br/><br/>This work had lasted two hours, and they began to fear that at<br/>this spot the wall would not yield to the pickaxe, when at a last<br/>blow given by Gideon Spilett, the instrument, passing through the<br/>rock, fell outside.<br/><br/>"Hurrah! hurrah!" cried Pencroft.<br/><br/>The wall only measured there three feet in thickness.<br/><br/>Harding applied his eye to the aperture, which overlooked the<br/>ground from a height of eighty feet. Before him was extended the<br/>sea-coast, the islet, and beyond the open sea.<br/><br/>Floods of light entered by this hole, inundating the splendid<br/>cavern and producing a magic effect! On its left side it did not<br/>measure more than thirty feet in height and breadth, but on the<br/>right it was enormous, and its vaulted roof rose to a height of<br/>more than eighty feet.<br/><br/>In some places granite pillars, irregularly disposed, supported<br/>the vaulted roof, as those in the nave of a cathedral, here forming<br/>lateral piers, there elliptical arches, adorned with pointed<br/>moldings, losing themselves in dark bays, amid the fantastic arches<br/>of which glimpses could be caught in the shade, covered with a<br/>profusion of projections formed like so many pendants. This cavern<br/>was a picturesque mixture of all the styles of Byzantine, Roman, or<br/>Gothic architecture ever produced by the hand of man. And yet this<br/>was only the work of nature. She alone had hollowed this fairy<br/>Aihambra in a mass of granite.<br/><br/>The settlers were overwhelmed with admiration. Where they had<br/>only expected to find a narrow cavity, they had found a sort of<br/>marvelous palace, and Neb had taken off his hat, as if he had been<br/>transported into a temple!<br/><br/>Cries of admiration issued from every mouth. Hurrahs resounded,<br/>and the echo was repeated again and again till it died away in the<br/>dark naves.<br/><br/>"Ah, my friends!" exclaimed Cyrus Harding, "when we have lighted<br/>the interior of this place, and have arranged our rooms and<br/>storehouses in the left part, we shall still have this splendid<br/>cavern, which we will make our study and our museum!"<br/><br/>
