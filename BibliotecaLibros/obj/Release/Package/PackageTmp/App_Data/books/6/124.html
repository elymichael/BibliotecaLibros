"I acknowledge," returned Spilett, "that the wound given this<br/>creature is, at least, very strange, and I cannot explain either<br/>how Top was so vigorously cast up out of the water. One could have<br/>thought that a powerful arm hurled him up, and that the same arm<br/>with a dagger killed the dugong!"<br/><br/>"Yes," replied the engineer, who had become thoughtful; "there<br/>is something there that I cannot understand. But do you better<br/>understand either, my dear Spilett, in what way I was saved<br/>myselfâ€”how I was drawn from the waves, and carried to the downs?<br/>No! Is it not true? Now, I feel sure that there is some mystery<br/>there, which, doubtless, we shall discover some day. Let us<br/>observe, but do not dwell on these singular incidents before our<br/>companions. Let us keep our remarks to ourselves, and continue our<br/>work."<br/><br/>It will be remembered that the engineer had not as yet been able<br/>to discover the place where the surplus water escaped, but he knew<br/>it must exist somewhere. He was much surprised to see a strong<br/>current at this place. By throwing in some bits of wood he found<br/>that it set towards the southern angle. He followed the current,<br/>and arrived at the south point of the lake.<br/><br/>There was there a sort of depression in the water, as if it was<br/>suddenly lost in some fissure in the ground.<br/><br/>Harding listened; placing his ear to the level of the lake, he<br/>very distinctly heard the noise of a subterranean fall.<br/><br/>"There," said he, rising, "is the discharge of the water; there,<br/>doubtless, by a passage in the granite cliff, it joins the sea,<br/>through cavities which we can use to our profit. Well, I can find<br/>it!"<br/><br/>The engineer cut a long branch, stripped it of its leaves, and<br/>plunging it into the angle between the two banks, he found that<br/>there was a large hole one foot only beneath the surface of the<br/>water. This hole was the opening so long looked for in vain, and<br/>the force of the current was such that the branch was torn from the<br/>engineer's hands and disappeared.<br/><br/>"There is no doubt about it now," repeated Harding. "There is<br/>the outlet, and I will lay it open to view!"<br/><br/>"How?" asked Gideon Spilett.<br/><br/>"By lowering the level of the water of the lake three feet."<br/>"And how will you lower the level?"<br/><br/>"By opening another outlet larger than this."<br/>
