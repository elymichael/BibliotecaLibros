"What!" said Herbert, "at such a distance from land?"<br/><br/>"Yes, my boy," replied the engineer. "These pirates are bold<br/>sailors as well as formidable enemies, and we must take measures<br/>accordingly."<br/><br/>"Well," replied Pencroft, "we will fortify ourselves against<br/>savages with two legs as well as against savages with four. But,<br/>captain, will it not be best to explore every part of the island<br/>before undertaking anything else?"<br/><br/>"That would be best," added Gideon Spilett.<br/><br/>"Who knows if we might not find on the opposite side one of the<br/>caverns which we have searched for in vain here?"<br/><br/>"That is true," replied the engineer, "but you forget, my<br/>friends, that it will be necessary to establish ourselves in the<br/>neighborhood of a watercourse, and that, from the summit of Mount<br/>Franklin, we could not see towards the west, either stream or<br/>river. Here, on the contrary, we are placed between the Mercy and<br/>Lake Grant, an advantage which must not be neglected. And, besides,<br/>this side, looking towards the east, is not exposed as the other is<br/>to the trade-winds, which in this hemisphere blow from the<br/>northwest."<br/><br/>"Then, captain," replied the sailor, "let us build a house on<br/>the edge of the lake. Neither bricks nor tools are wanting now.<br/>After having been brickmakers, potters, smelters, and smiths, we<br/>shall surely know how to be masons!"<br/><br/>"Yes, my friend; but before coming to any decision we must<br/>consider the matter thoroughly. A natural dwelling would spare us<br/>much work, and would be a surer retreat, for it would be as well<br/>defended against enemies from the interior as those from<br/>outside."<br/><br/>"That is true, Cyrus," replied the reporter, "but we have<br/>already examined all that mass of granite, and there is not a hole,<br/>not a cranny!"<br/><br/>"No, not one!" added Pencroft. "Ah, if we were able to dig out a<br/>dwelling in that cliff, at a good height, so as to be out of the<br/>reach of harm, that would be capital! I can see that on the front<br/>which looks seaward, five or six roomsâ€”"<br/><br/>"With windows to light them!" said Herbert, laughing.<br/>
