"Top has seen something," cried one of the men. Then immediately<br/>a loud voice shouted,â€”<br/><br/>"Land! land!" The balloon, which the wind still drove towards<br/>the southwest, had since daybreak gone a considerable distance,<br/>which might be reckoned by hundreds of miles, and a tolerably high<br/>land had, in fact, appeared in that direction. But this land was<br/>still thirty miles off. It would not take less than an hour to get<br/>to it, and then there was the chance of falling to leeward.<br/><br/>An hour! Might not the balloon before that be emptied of all the<br/>fluid it yet retained?<br/><br/>Such was the terrible question! The voyagers could distinctly<br/>see that solid spot which they must reach at any cost. They were<br/>ignorant of what it was, whether an island or a continent, for they<br/>did not know to what part of the world the hurricane had driven<br/>them. But they must reach this land, whether inhabited or desolate,<br/>whether hospitable or not.<br/><br/>It was evident that the balloon could no longer support itself!<br/>Several times already had the crests of the enormous billows licked<br/>the bottom of the net, making it still heavier, and the balloon<br/>only half rose, like a bird with a wounded wing. Half an hour later<br/>the land was not more than a mile off, but the balloon, exhausted,<br/>flabby, hanging in great folds, had gas in its upper part alone.<br/>The voyagers, clinging to the net, were still too heavy for it, and<br/>soon, half plunged into the sea, they were beaten by the furious<br/>waves. The balloon-case bulged out again, and the wind, taking it,<br/>drove it along like a vessel. Might it not possibly thus reach the<br/>land?<br/><br/>But, when only two fathoms off, terrible cries resounded from<br/>four pairs of lungs at once. The balloon, which had appeared as if<br/>it would never again rise, suddenly made an unexpected bound, after<br/>having been struck by a tremendous sea. As if it had been at that<br/>instant relieved of a new part of its weight, it mounted to a<br/>height of 1,500 feet, and here it met a current of wind, which<br/>instead of taking it directly to the coast, carried it in a nearly<br/>parallel direction.<br/><br/>At last, two minutes later, it reproached obliquely, and finally<br/>fell on a sandy beach, out of the reach of the waves.<br/><br/>The voyagers, aiding each other, managed to disengage themselves<br/>from the meshes of the net. The balloon, relieved of their weight,<br/>was taken by the wind, and like a wounded bird which revives for an<br/>instant, disappeared into space.<br/><br/>But the car had contained five passengers, with a dog, and the<br/>balloon only left four on the shore.<br/><br/>The missing person had evidently been swept off by the sea,<br/>which had just struck the net, and it was owing to this<br/>circumstance that the lightened balloon rose the last time, and<br/>then soon after reached the land. Scarcely had the four castaways<br/>set foot on firm ground, than they all, thinking of the absent one,<br/>simultaneously exclaimed, "Perhaps he will try to swim to land! Let<br/>us save him! let us save him!"<br/><br/><br/>
