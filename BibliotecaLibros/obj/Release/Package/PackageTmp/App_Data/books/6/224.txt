The orang replied by a little grunt which did not show any
anger.

"You wish to join the colony?" again asked the sailor. "You are
going to enter the service of Captain Cyrus Harding?"

Another respondent grunt was uttered by the ape.

"And you will be satisfied with no other wages than your
food?"

Third affirmative grunt.

"This conversation is slightly monotonous," observed Gideon
Spilett.

"So much the better," replied Pencroft; "the best servants are
those who talk the least. And then, no wages, do you hear, my boy?
We will give you no wages at first, but we will double them
afterwards if we are pleased with you."

Thus the colony was increased by a new member. As to his name
the sailor begged that in memory of another ape which he had known,
he might be called Jupiter, and Jup for short.

And so, without more ceremony, Master Jup was installed in
Granite House.
