"You are not hurt, Herbert?" asked Spilett.

"No, no!"

"Oh, if this ape had wounded him!" exclaimed Pencroft.

"But he is not an ape," answered Herbert.

At these words Pencroft and Gideon Spilett looked at the
singular being who lay on the ground. Indeed it was not an ape; it
was a human being, a man. But what a man! A savage in all the
horrible acceptation of the word, and so much the more frightful
that he seemed fallen to the lowest degree of brutishness!

Shaggy hair, untrimmed beard descending to the chest, the body
almost naked except a rag round the waist, wild eyes, enormous
hands with immensely long nails, skin the color of mahogany, feet
as hard as if made of horn, such was the miserable creature who yet
had a claim to be called a man. But it might justly be asked if
there were yet a soul in this body, or if the brute instinct alone
survived in it!

"Are you quite sure that this is a man, or that he has ever been
one?" said Pencroft to the reporter.

"Alas! there is no doubt about it," replied Spilett.

"Then this must be the castaway?" asked Herbert.

"Yes," replied Gideon Spilett, "but the unfortunate man has no
longer anything human about him!"

The reporter spoke the truth. It was evident that if the
castaway had ever been a civilized being, solitude had made him a
savage, or worse, perhaps a regular man of the woods. Hoarse sounds
issued from his throat between his teeth, which were sharp as the
teeth of a wild beast made to tear raw flesh.
