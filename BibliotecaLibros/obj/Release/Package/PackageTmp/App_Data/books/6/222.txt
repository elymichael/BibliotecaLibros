"Well now, and the ladder," cried the sailor; "who can the
gentleman have been who sent us that down?"

But at that moment a cry was heard, and a great orang, who had
hidden himself in the passage, rushed into the room, pursued by
Neb.

"Ah, the robber!" cried Pencroft.

And hatchet in hand, he was about to cleave the head of the
animal, when Cyrus Harding seized his arm, saying,â€”

"Spare him, Pencroft."

"Pardon this rascal?"

"Yes! it was he who threw us the ladder!"

And the engineer said this in such a peculiar voice that it was
difficult to know whether he spoke seriously or not.

Nevertheless, they threw themselves on the orang, who defended
himself gallantly, but was soon overpowered and bound.

"There!" said Pencroft. "And what shall we make of him, now
we've got him?"

"A servant!" replied Herbert.
