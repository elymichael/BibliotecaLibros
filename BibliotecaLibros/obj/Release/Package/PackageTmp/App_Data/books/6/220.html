Two hours passed, during which the apes took care not to show<br/>themselves, but they were still there, and three or four times a<br/>nose or a paw was poked out at the door or windows, and was<br/>immediately saluted by a gun- shot.<br/><br/>"Let us hide ourselves," at last said the engineer. "Perhaps the<br/>apes will think we have gone quite away and will show themselves<br/>again. Let Spilett and Herbert conceal themselves behind those<br/>rocks and fire on all that may appear."<br/><br/>The engineer's orders were obeyed, and while the reporter and<br/>the lad, the best marksmen in the colony, posted themselves in a<br/>good position, but out of the monkeys' sight, Neb, Pencroft, and<br/>Cyrus climbed the plateau and entered the forest in order to kill<br/>some game, for it was now time for breakfast and they had no<br/>provisions remaining.<br/><br/>In half an hour the hunters returned with a few rock pigeons,<br/>which they roasted as well as they could. Not an ape had appeared.<br/>Gideon Spilett and Herbert went to take their share of the<br/>breakfast, leaving Top to watch under the windows. They then,<br/>having eaten, returned to their post.<br/><br/>Two hours later, their situation was in no degree improved. The<br/>quadrumana gave no sign of existence, and it might have been<br/>supposed that they had disappeared; but what seemed more probable<br/>was that, terrified by the death of one of their companions, and<br/>frightened by the noise of the firearms, they had retreated to the<br/>back part of the house or probably even into the store-room. And<br/>when they thought of the valuables which this storeroom contained,<br/>the patience so much recommended by the engineer, fast changed into<br/>great irritation, and there certainly was room for it.<br/><br/>"Decidedly it is too bad," said the reporter; "and the worst of<br/>it is, there is no way of putting an end to it."<br/><br/>"But we must drive these vagabonds out somehow," cried the<br/>sailor. "We could soon get the better of them, even if there are<br/>twenty of the rascals; but for that, we must meet them hand to<br/>hand. Come now, is there no way of getting at them?"<br/><br/>"Let us try to enter Granite House by the old opening at the<br/>lake," replied the engineer.<br/><br/>"Oh!" shouted the sailor, "and I never thought of that."<br/><br/>This was in reality the only way by which to penetrate into<br/>Granite House so as to fight with and drive out the intruders. The<br/>opening was, it is true, closed up with a wall of cemented stones,<br/>which it would be necessary to sacrifice, but that could easily be<br/>rebuilt. Fortunately, Cyrus Harding had not as yet effected his<br/>project of hiding this opening by raising the waters of the lake,<br/>for the operation would then have taken some time.<br/><br/>It was already past twelve o'clock, when the colonists, well<br/>armed and provided with picks and spades, left the Chimneys, passed<br/>beneath the windows of Granite House, after telling Top to remain<br/>at his post, and began to ascend the left bank of the Mercy, so as<br/>to reach Prospect Heights.<br/>
