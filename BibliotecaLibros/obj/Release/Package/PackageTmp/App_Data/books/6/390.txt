The settlers rowed round the hull, and in proportion as the tide
went down, they could ascertain, if not the cause which had
occasioned the catastrophe, at least the effect produced.

Towards the bows, on both sides of the keel, seven or eight feet
from the beginning of the stem, the sides of the brig were
frightfully torn. Over a length of at least twenty feet there
opened two large leaks, which would be impossible to stop up. Not
only had the copper sheathing and the planks disappeared, reduced,
no doubt, to powder, but also the ribs, the iron bolts, and
treenalls which united them. From the entire length of the hull to
the stern the false keel had been separated with an unaccountable
violence, and the keel itself, torn from the carline in several
places, was split in all its length.

"I've a notion!" exclaimed Pencroft, "that this vessel will be
difficult to get afloat again."

"It will be impossible," said Ayrton.

"At any rate," observed Gideon Spilett to the sailor, "the
explosion, if there has been one, has produced singular effects! It
has split the lower part of the hull, instead of blowing up the
deck and topsides! These great rents appear rather to have been
made by a rock than by the explosion of a powder-magazine."

"There is not a rock in the channel!" answered the sailor. "I
will admit anything you like, except the rock."

"Let us try to penetrate into the interior of the brig," said
the engineer; "perhaps we shall then know what to think of the
cause of her destruction."

This was the best thing to be done, and it was agreed, besides,
to take an inventory of all the treasures on board, and to arrange
their preservation.

Access to the interior of the brig was now easy. The tide was
still going down and the deck was practicable. The ballast,
composed of heavy masses of iron, had broken through in several
places. The noise of the sea could be heard as it rushed out at the
holes in the hull.

Cyrus Harding and his companions, hatchets in hand, advanced
along the shattered deck. Cases of all sorts encumbered it, and, as
they had been but a very short time in the water, their contents
were perhaps uninjured.

They then busied themselves in placing all this cargo in safety.
The water would not return for several hours, and these hours must
be employed in the most profitable way. Ayrton and Pencroft had, at
the entrance made in the hull, discovered tackle, which would serve
to hoist up the barrels and chests. The boat received them and
transported them to the shore. They took the articles as they came,
intending to sort them afterwards.
