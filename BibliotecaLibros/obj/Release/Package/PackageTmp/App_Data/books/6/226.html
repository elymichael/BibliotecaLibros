But though there might be no inconvenience in the enclosure<br/>being so far from Granite House, it would not be the same with the<br/>poultry-yard, to which Neb called the attention of the colonists.<br/>It was indeed necessary that the birds should be close within reach<br/>of the cook, and no place appeared more favorable for the<br/>establishment of the said poultry-yard than that portion of the<br/>banks of the lake which was close to the old opening.<br/><br/>Water-birds would prosper there as well as others, and the<br/>couple of tinamous taken in their last excursion would be the first<br/>to be domesticated.<br/><br/>The next day, the 3rd of November, the new works were begun by<br/>the construction of the bridge, and all hands were required for<br/>this important task. Saws, hatchets, and hammers were shouldered by<br/>the settlers, who, now transformed into carpenters, descended to<br/>the shore.<br/><br/>There Pencroft observed,â€”<br/><br/>"Suppose, that during our absence, Master Jup takes it into his<br/>head to draw up the ladder which he so politely returned to us<br/>yesterday?"<br/><br/>"Let us tie its lower end down firmly," replied Cyrus<br/>Harding.<br/><br/>This was done by means of two stakes securely fixed in the sand.<br/>Then the settlers, ascending the left bank of the Mercy, soon<br/>arrived at the angle formed by the river.<br/><br/>There they halted, in order to ascertain if the bridge could be<br/>thrown across.

In this way, Granite<br/>House, the Chimneys, the poultry-yard, and all the upper part of<br/>the plateau which was to be used for cultivation, would be<br/>protected against the depredations of animals. Nothing could be<br/>easier than to execute this project, and this is how the engineer<br/>intended to set to work.<br/><br/>The plateau was already defended on three sides by<br/>water-courses, either artificial or natural. On the northwest, by<br/>the shores of Lake Grant, from the entrance of the passage to the<br/>breach made in the banks of the lake for the escape of the<br/>water.<br/>
