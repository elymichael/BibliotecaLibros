<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>3<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>The night passed without incident. The colonists were on the qui<br/>vive, and did not leave their post at the Chimneys. The pirates, on<br/>their side, did not appear to have made any attempt to land. Since<br/>the last shots fired at Ayrton not a report, not even a sound, had<br/>betrayed the presence of the brig in the neighborhood of the<br/>island. It might have been fancied that she had weighed anchor,<br/>thinking that she had to deal with her match, and had left the<br/>coast.<br/><br/>But it was no such thing, and when day began to dawn the<br/>settlers could see a confused mass through the morning mist. It was<br/>the "Speedy."<br/><br/>"These, my friends," said the engineer, "are the arrangements<br/>which appear to me best to make before the fog completely clears<br/>away. It hides us from the eyes of the pirates, and we can act<br/>without attracting their attention. The most important thing is,<br/>that the convicts should believe that the inhabitants of the island<br/>are numerous, and consequently capable of resisting them. I<br/>therefore propose that we divide into three parties. The first of<br/>which shall be posted at the Chimneys, the second at the mouth of<br/>the Mercy. As to the third, I think it would be best to place it on<br/>the islet, so as to prevent, or at all events delay, any attempt at<br/>landing. We have the use of two rifles and four muskets. Each of us<br/>will be armed, and, as we are amply provided with powder and shot,<br/>we need not spare our fire. We have nothing to fear from the<br/>muskets nor even from the guns of the brig. What can they do<br/>against these rocks? And, as we shall not fire from the windows of<br/>Granite House, the pirates will not think of causing irreparable<br/>damage by throwing shell against it. What is to be feared is, the<br/>necessity of meeting hand-to-hand, since the convicts have numbers<br/>on their side. We must therefore try to prevent them from landing,<br/>but without discovering ourselves. Therefore, do not economize the<br/>ammunition. Fire often, but with a sure aim. We have each eight or<br/>ten enemies to kill, and they must be killed!"<br/><br/>Cyrus Harding had clearly represented their situation, although<br/>he spoke in the calmest voice, as if it was a question of directing<br/>a piece of work and not ordering a battle. His companions approved<br/>these arrangements without even uttering a word. There was nothing<br/>more to be done but for each to take his place before the fog<br/>should be completely dissipated. Neb and Pencroft immediately<br/>ascended to Granite House and brought back a sufficient quantity of<br/>ammunition. Gideon Spilett and Ayrton, both very good marksmen,<br/>were armed with the two rifles, which carried nearly a mile. The<br/>four other muskets were divided among Harding, Neb, Pencroft, and<br/>Herbert.<br/><br/>The posts were arranged in the following manner:â€”<br/><br/>Cyrus Harding and Herbert remained in ambush at the Chimneys,<br/>thus commanding the shore to the foot of Granite House.<br/><br/>
