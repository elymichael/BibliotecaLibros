Then there was a general helter-skelter. The ten others, not
even stopping to pick up their dead or wounded companions, fled to
the other side of the islet, tumbled into the boat which had
brought them, and pulled away with all their strength.

"Eight less!" exclaimed Pencroft. "Really, one would have
thought that Mr. Spilett and Ayrton had given the word to fire
together!"

"Gentlemen," said Ayrton, as he reloaded his gun, "this is
becoming more serious. The brig is making sail!"

"The anchor is weighed!" exclaimed Pencroft.

"Yes, and she is already moving."

In fact, they could distinctly hear the creaking of the
windlass. The "Speedy" was at first held by her anchor; then, when
that had been raised, she began to drift towards the shore. The
wind was blowing from the sea; the jib and the foretopsail were
hoisted, and the vessel gradually approached the island.

From the two posts of the Mercy and the Chimneys they watched
her without giving a sign of life, but not without some emotion.
What could be more terrible for the colonists than to be exposed,
at a short distance, to the brig's guns, without being able to
reply with any effect? How could they then prevent the pirates from
landing?

Cyrus Harding felt this strongly, and he asked himself what it
would be possible to do. Before long, he would be called upon for
his determination. But what was it to be? To shut themselves up in
Granite House, to be besieged there, to remain there for weeks, for
months even, since they had an abundance of provisions? So far
good! But after that? The pirates would not the less be masters of
the island, which they would ravage at their pleasure, and in time,
they would end by having their revenge on the prisoners in Granite
House.

However, one chance yet remained; it was that Bob Harvey, after
all, would not venture his ship into the channel, and that he would
keep outside the islet. He would be still separated from the coast
by half a mile, and at that distance his shot could not be very
destructive.

"Never!" repeated Pencroft, "Bob Harvey will never, if he is a
good seaman, enter that channel! He knows well that it would risk
the brig, if the sea got up ever so little! And what would become
of him without his vessel?"
