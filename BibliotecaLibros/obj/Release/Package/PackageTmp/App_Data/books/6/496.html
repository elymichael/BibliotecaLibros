"Now, sir," said he, "now that you know my history, your<br/>judgment!"<br/><br/>In saying this, the captain evidently alluded to an important<br/>incident witnessed by the three strangers thrown on board his<br/>vessel, and which the French professor had related in his work,<br/>causing a profound and terrible sensation. Some days previous to<br/>the flight of the professor and his two companions, the "Nautilus,"<br/>being chased by a frigate in the north of the Atlantic had hurled<br/>herself as a ram upon this frigate, and sunk her without mercy.<br/><br/>Cyrus Harding understood the captain's allusion, and was<br/>silent.<br/><br/>"It was an enemy's frigate," exclaimed Captain Nemo, transformed<br/>for an instant into the Prince Dakkar, "an enemy's frigate! It was<br/>she who attacked me—I was in a narrow and shallow bay—the frigate<br/>barred my way— and I sank her!"<br/><br/>A few moments of silence ensued; then the captain demanded,—<br/><br/>"What think you of my life, gentlemen?"<br/><br/>Cyrus Harding extended his hand to the ci-devant prince and<br/>replied gravely, "Sir, your error was in supposing that the past<br/>can be resuscitated, and in contending against inevitable progress.<br/>It is one of those errors which some admire, others blame; which<br/>God alone can judge. He who is mistaken in an action which he<br/>sincerely believes to be right may be an enemy, but retains our<br/>esteem. Your error is one that we may admire, and your name has<br/>nothing to fear from the judgment of history, which does not<br/>condemn heroic folly, but its results."<br/><br/>The old man's breast swelled with emotion, and raising his hand<br/>to heaven,—<br/><br/>"Was I wrong, or in the right?" he murmured.<br/><br/>Cyrus Harding replied, "All great actions return to God, from<br/>whom they are derived. Captain Nemo, we, whom you have succored,<br/>shall ever mourn your loss."<br/><br/>Herbert, who had drawn near the captain, fell on his knees and<br/>kissed his hand.<br/>
