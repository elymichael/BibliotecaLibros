<br/>On the 6th of April, at daybreak, the engineer and his<br/>companions were collected in the glade, at the place where they<br/>were going to perform the operation of baking the bricks. Naturally<br/>this had to be in the open air, and not in a kiln, or rather, the<br/>agglomeration of bricks made an enormous kiln, which would bake<br/>itself. The fuel, made of well-prepared fagots, was laid on the<br/>ground and surrounded with several rows of dried bricks, which soon<br/>formed an enormous cube, to the exterior of which they contrived<br/>air- holes. The work lasted all day, and it was not till the<br/>evening that they set fire to the fagots. No one slept that night,<br/>all watching carefully to keep up the fire.<br/><br/>The operation lasted forty-eight hours, and succeeded perfectly.<br/>It then became necessary to leave the smoking mass to cool, and<br/>during this time Neb and Pencroft, guided by Cyrus Harding,<br/>brought, on a hurdle made of interlaced branches, loads of<br/>carbonate of lime and common stones, which were very abundant, to<br/>the north of the lake. These stones, when decomposed by heat, made<br/>a very strong quicklime, greatly increased by slacking, at least as<br/>pure as if it had been produced by the calcination of chalk or<br/>marble. Mixed with sand the lime made excellent mortar.<br/><br/>The result of these different works was, that, on the 9th of<br/>April, the engineer had at his disposal a quantity of prepared lime<br/>and some thousands of bricks.<br/><br/>Without losing an instant, therefore, they began the<br/>construction of a kiln to bake the pottery, which was indispensable<br/>for their domestic use. They succeeded without much difficulty.<br/>Five days after, the kiln was supplied with coal, which the<br/>engineer had discovered lying open to the sky towards the mouth of<br/>the Red Creek, and the first smoke escaped from a chimney twenty<br/>feet high. The glade was transformed into a manufactory, and<br/>Pencroft was not far wrong in believing that from this kiln would<br/>issue all the products of modern industry.<br/><br/>In the meantime what the settlers first manufactured was a<br/>common pottery in which to cook their food. The chief material was<br/>clay, to which Harding added a little lime and quartz. This paste<br/>made regular "pipe-clay," with which they manufactured bowls, cups<br/>molded on stones of a proper size, great jars and pots to hold<br/>water, etc. The shape of these objects was clumsy and defective,<br/>but after they had been baked in a high temperature, the kitchen of<br/>the Chimneys was provided with a number of utensils, as precious to<br/>the settlers as the most beautifully enameled china. We must<br/>mention here that Pencroft, desirous to know if the clay thus<br/>prepared was worthy of its name of pipe-clay, made some large<br/>pipes, which he thought charming, but for which, alas! he had no<br/>tobacco, and that was a great privation to Pencroft. "But tobacco<br/>will come, like everything else!" he repeated, in a burst of<br/>absolute confidence.<br/><br/>This work lasted till the 15th of April, and the time was well<br/>employed. The settlers, having become potters, made nothing but<br/>pottery. When it suited Cyrus Harding to change them into smiths,<br/>they would become smiths. But the next day being Sunday, and also<br/>Easter Sunday, all agreed to sanctify the day by rest. These<br/>Americans were religious men, scrupulous observers of the precepts<br/>of the Bible, and their situation could not but develop sentiments<br/>of confidence towards the Author of all things.<br/><br/>On the evening of the 15th of April they returned to the<br/>Chimneys, carrying with them the pottery, the furnace being<br/>extinguished until they could put it to a new use. Their return was<br/>marked by a fortunate incident; the engineer discovered a substance<br/>which replaced tinder. It is known that a spongy, velvety flesh is<br/>procured from a certain mushroom of the genus polyporous. Properly<br/>prepared, it is extremely inflammable, especially when it has been<br/>previously saturated with gunpowder, or boiled in a solution of<br/>nitrate or chlorate of potash. But, till then, they had not found<br/>any of these polypores or even any of the morels which could<br/>replace them. On this day, the engineer, seeing a plant belonging<br/>to the wormwood genus, the principal species of which are absinthe,<br/>balm-mint, tarragon, etc., gathered several tufts, and, presenting<br/>them to the sailor, said,â€”<br/><br/>"Here, Pencroft, this will please you."<br/><br/>Pencroft looked attentively at the plant, covered with long<br/>silky hair, the leaves being clothed with soft down.<br/><br/>"What's that, captain?" asked Pencroft. "Is it tobacco?"<br/><br/>
