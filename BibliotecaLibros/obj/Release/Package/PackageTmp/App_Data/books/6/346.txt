"What is especially curious," observed Harding, "is that the
gulf has been formed by two rivers of lava, thrown out by the
volcano, and accumulated by successive eruptions. The result is
that the gulf is completely sheltered on all sides, and I believe
that even in the stormiest weather, the sea here must be as calm as
a lake."

"No doubt," returned the sailor, "since the wind has only that
narrow entrance between the two capes to get in by, and, besides,
the north cape protects that of the south in a way which would make
the entrance of gusts very difficult. I declare our 'Bonadventure'
could stay here from one end of the year to the other, without even
dragging at her anchor!"

"It is rather large for her!" observed the reporter.

"Well! Mr. Spilett," replied the sailor, "I agree that it is too
large for the 'Bonadventure,' but if the fleets of the Union were
in want of a harbor in the Pacific, I don't think they would ever
find a better place than this!"

"We are in the shark's mouth," remarked Nab, alluding to the
form of the gulf.

"Right into its mouth, my honest Nab!" replied Herbert, "but you
are not afraid that it will shut upon us, are you?"

"No, Mr. Herbert," answered Neb, "and yet this gulf here doesn't
please me much! It has a wicked look!"

"Hallo!" cried Pencroft, "here is Neb turning up his nose at my
gulf, just as I was thinking of presenting it to America!"

"But, at any rate, is the water deep enough?" asked the
engineer, "for a depth sufficient for the keel of the
'Bonadventure' would not be enough for those of our
iron-clads."

"That is easily found out," replied Pencroft.

And the sailor sounded with a long cord, which served him as a
lead-line, and to which was fastened a lump of iron. This cord
measured nearly fifty fathoms, and its entire length was unrolled
without finding any bottom.
