"Ayrton then related all his life, and it was certain that he<br/>knew nothing from the day on which Captain Grant had landed him on<br/>the Australian coast.<br/><br/>"Nevertheless, Lord Glenarvan kept the promise which he had<br/>given. The 'Duncan' continued her voyage and arrived at Tabor<br/>Island. It was there that Ayrton was to be landed, and it was there<br/>also that, by a veritable miracle, they found Captain Grant and two<br/>men, exactly on the thirty- seventh parallel.<br/><br/>"The convict, then, went to take their place on this desert<br/>islet, and at the moment he left the yacht these words were<br/>pronounced by Lord Glenarvan:â€”<br/><br/>"'Here, Ayrton, you will be far from any land, and without any<br/>possible communication with your fellow-creatures. You can-not<br/>escape from this islet on which the 'Duncan' leaves you. You will<br/>be alone, under the eye of a God who reads the depths of the heart,<br/>but you will be neither lost nor forgotten, as was Captain Grant.<br/>Unworthy as you are to be remembered by men, men will remember you.<br/>I know where you are Ayrton, and I know where to find you. I will<br/>never forget it!<br/><br/>"And the 'Duncan,' making sail, soon disappeared. This was 18th<br/>of March, 1855.<br/><br/>(The events which have just been briefly related are taken from<br/>a<br/><br/>work which some of our readers have no doubt read, and which<br/>is<br/><br/>entitled, "Captain Grant's children." They will remark on<br/>this<br/><br/>occasion, as well as later, some discrepancy in the dates;<br/>but<br/><br/>later again, they will understand why the real dates were not<br/>at<br/><br/>first given.)<br/>
