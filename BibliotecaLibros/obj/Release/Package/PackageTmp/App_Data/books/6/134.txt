"Nearly a third," replied Harding, "for we have descended a
hundred feet from the opening, and it is not impossible that a
hundred feet farther downâ€”"

"Where is Top?" asked Neb, interrupting his master.

They searched the cavern, but the dog was not there.

"Most likely he has gone on," said Pencroft.

"Let us join him," replied Harding.

The descent was continued. The engineer carefully observed all
the deviations of the passage, and notwithstanding so many detours,
he could easily have given an account of its general direction,
which went towards the sea.

The settlers had gone some fifty feet farther, when their
attention was attracted by distant sounds which came up from the
depths. They stopped and listened. These sounds, carried through
the passage as through an acoustic tube, came clearly to the
ear.

"That is Top barking!" cried Herbert.

"Yes," replied Pencroft, "and our brave dog is barking
furiously!"

"We have our iron-tipped spears," said Cyrus Harding. "Keep on
your guard, and forward!"

"It is becoming more and more interesting," murmured Gideon
Spilett in the sailor's ear, who nodded. Harding and his companions
rushed to the help of their dog. Top's barking became more and more
perceptible, and it seemed strangely fierce. Was he engaged in a
struggle with some animal whose retreat he had disturbed? Without
thinking of the danger to which they might be exposed, the
explorers were now impelled by an irresistible curiosity, and in a
few minutes, sixteen feet lower they rejoined Top.
