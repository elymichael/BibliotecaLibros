A single thing had the honor of drawing him, but for one day<br/>only, from his dockyard. This was the second wheat-harvest, which<br/>was gathered in on the 15th of April. It was as much a success as<br/>the first, and yielded the number of grains which had been<br/>predicted.<br/><br/>"Five bushels, captain," said Pencroft, alter having<br/>scrupulously measured his treasure.<br/><br/>"Five bushels," replied the engineer; "and a hundred and thirty<br/>thousand grains a bushel will make six hundred and fifty thousand<br/>grains."<br/><br/>"Well, we will sow them all this time," said the sailor, "except<br/>a little in reserve."<br/><br/>"Yes, Pencroft, and if the next crop gives a proportionate<br/>yield, we shall have four thousand bushels."<br/><br/>"And shall we eat bread?"<br/><br/>"We shall eat bread."<br/><br/>"But we must have a mill.<br/><br/>"We will make one."<br/><br/>The third corn-field was very much larger than the two first,<br/>and the soil, prepared with extreme care, received the precious<br/>seed. That done, Pencroft returned to his work.<br/><br/>During this time Spilett and Herbert hunted in the neighborhood,<br/>and they ventured deep into the still unknown parts of the Far<br/>West, their guns loaded with ball, ready for any dangerous<br/>emergency. It was a vast thicket of magnificent trees, crowded<br/>together as if pressed for room. The exploration of these dense<br/>masses of wood was difficult in the extreme, and the reporter never<br/>ventured there without the pocket-compass, for the sun scarcely<br/>pierced through the thick foliage and it would have been very<br/>difficult for them to retrace their way. It naturally happened that<br/>game was more rare in those situations where there was hardly<br/>sufficient room to move; two or three large herbivorous animals<br/>were however killed during the last fortnight of April. These were<br/>koalas, specimens of which the settlers had already seen to the<br/>north of the lake, and which stupidly allowed themselves to be<br/>killed among the thick branches of the trees in which they took<br/>refuge. Their skins were brought back to Granite House, and there,<br/>by the help of sulphuric acid, they were subjected to a sort of<br/>tanning process which rendered them capable of being used.<br/>
