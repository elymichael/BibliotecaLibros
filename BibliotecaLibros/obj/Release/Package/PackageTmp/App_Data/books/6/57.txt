Pencroft, to his extreme surprise, found that the terrible storm
had quite altered the aspect of the place. Important changes had
occurred; great blocks of stone lay on the beach, which was also
covered with a thick carpet of sea-weed, algae, and wrack.
Evidently the sea, passing over the islet, had been carried right
up to the foot of the enormous curtain of granite. The soil in
front of the cave had been torn away by the violence of the waves.
A horrid presentiment flashed across Pencroft's mind. He rushed
into the passage, but returned almost immediately, and stood
motionless, staring at his companionsâ€¦ . The fire was out; the
drowned cinders were nothing but mud; the burnt linen, which was to
have served as tinder, had disappeared! The sea had penetrated to
the end of the passages, and everything was overthrown and
destroyed in the interior of the Chimneys!
