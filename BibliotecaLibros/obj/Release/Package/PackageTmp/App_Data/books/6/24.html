"Let us get a supply," replied Herbert, who immediately set to<br/>work.<br/><br/>The collection was easily made. It was not even necessary to lop<br/>the trees, for enormous quantities of dead wood were lying at their<br/>feet; but if fuel was not wanting, the means of transporting it was<br/>not yet found. The wood, being very dry, would burn rapidly; it was<br/>therefore necessary to carry to the Chimneys a considerable<br/>quantity, and the loads of two men would not be sufficient. Herbert<br/>remarked this.<br/><br/>"Well, my boy," replied the sailor, "there must be some way of<br/>carrying this wood; there is always a way of doing everything. If<br/>we had a cart or a boat, it would be easy enough."<br/><br/>"But we have the river," said Herbert.<br/><br/>"Right," replied Pencroft; "the river will be to us like a road<br/>which carries of itself, and rafts have not been invented for<br/>nothing."<br/><br/>"Only," observed Herbert, "at this moment our road is going the<br/>wrong way, for the tide is rising!"<br/><br/>"We shall be all right if we wait till it ebbs," replied the<br/>sailor, "and then we will trust it to carry our fuel to the<br/>Chimneys. Let us get the raft ready."<br/><br/>The sailor, followed by Herbert, directed his steps towards the<br/>river. They both carried, each in proportion to his strength, a<br/>load of wood bound in fagots. They found on the bank also a great<br/>quantity of dead branches in the midst of grass, among which the<br/>foot of man had probably never before trod. Pencroft began directly<br/>to make his raft. In a kind of little bay, created by a point of<br/>the shore which broke the current, the sailor and the lad placed<br/>some good-sized pieces of wood, which they had fastened together<br/>with dry creepers. A raft was thus formed, on which they stacked<br/>all they had collected, sufficient, indeed, to have loaded at least<br/>twenty men. In an hour the work was finished, and the raft moored<br/>to the bank, awaited the turning of the tide.<br/><br/>There were still several hours to be occupied, and with one<br/>consent Pencroft and Herbert resolved to gain the upper plateau, so<br/>as to have a more extended view of the surrounding country.<br/><br/>Exactly two hundred feet behind the angle formed by the river,<br/>the wall, terminated by a fall of rocks, died away in a gentle<br/>slope to the edge of the forest. It was a natural staircase.<br/>Herbert and the sailor began their ascent; thanks to the vigor of<br/>their muscles they reached the summit in a few minutes; and<br/>proceeded to the point above the mouth of the river.<br/><br/>On attaining it, their first look was cast upon the ocean which<br/>not long before they had traversed in such a terrible condition.<br/>They observed, with emotion, all that part to the north of the<br/>coast on which the catastrophe had taken place. It was there that<br/>Cyrus Harding had disappeared. They looked to see if some portion<br/>of their balloon, to which a man might possibly cling, yet existed.<br/>Nothing! The sea was but one vast watery desert. As to the coast,<br/>it was solitary also. Neither the reporter nor Neb could be<br/>anywhere seen. But it was possible that at this time they were both<br/>too far away to be perceived.<br/>
