"Consequently, your watch is set by the meridian of that town,<br/>which is almost that of Washington?"<br/><br/>"Undoubtedly."<br/><br/>"Very well, keep it thus. Content yourself with winding it up<br/>very, exactly, but do not touch the hands. This may be of use to<br/>us.<br/><br/>"What will be the good of that?" thought the sailor.<br/><br/>They ate, and so heartily, that the store of game and almonds<br/>was totally exhausted. But Pencroft was not at all uneasy, they<br/>would supply themselves on the way. Top, whose share had been very<br/>much to his taste, would know how to find some fresh game among the<br/>brushwood. Moreover, the sailor thought of simply asking the<br/>engineer to manufacture some powder and one or two fowling-pieces;<br/>he supposed there would be no difficulty in that.<br/><br/>On leaving the plateau, the captain proposed to his companions<br/>to return to the Chimneys by a new way. He wished to reconnoiter<br/>Lake Grant, so magnificently framed in trees. They therefore<br/>followed the crest of one of the spurs, between which the creek<br/>that supplied the lake probably had its source. In talking, the<br/>settlers already employed the names which they had just chosen,<br/>which singularly facilitated the exchange of their ideas. Herbert<br/>and Pencroft—the one young and the other very boyish—were<br/>enchanted, and while walking, the sailor said,<br/><br/>"Hey, Herbert! how capital it sounds! It will be impossible to<br/>lose ourselves, my boy, since, whether we follow the way to Lake<br/>Grant, or whether we join the Mercy through the woods of the Far<br/>West, we shall be certain to arrive at Prospect Heights, and,<br/>consequently, at Union Bay!"<br/><br/>It had been agreed, that without forming a compact band, the<br/>settlers should not stray away from each other. It was very certain<br/>that the thick forests of the island were inhabited by dangerous<br/>animals, and it was prudent to be on their guard. In general,<br/>Pencroft, Herbert, and Neb walked first, preceded by Top, who poked<br/>his nose into every bush. The reporter and the engineer went<br/>together, Gideon Spilett ready to note every incident, the engineer<br/>silent for the most part, and only stepping aside to pick up one<br/>thing or another, a mineral or vegetable substance, which he put<br/>into his pocket, without making any remark.<br/><br/>"What can he be picking up?" muttered Pencroft. "I have looked<br/>in vain for anything that's worth the trouble of stooping for."<br/><br/>Towards ten o'clock the little band descended the last<br/>declivities of Mount Franklin. As yet the ground was scantily<br/>strewn with bushes and trees. They were walking over yellowish<br/>calcinated earth, forming a plain of nearly a mile long, which<br/>extended to the edge of the wood. Great blocks of that basalt,<br/>which, according to Bischof, takes three hundred and fifty millions<br/>of years to cool, strewed the plain, very confused in some places.<br/>However, there were here no traces of lava, which was spread more<br/>particularly over the northern slopes.<br/><br/>Cyrus Harding expected to reach, without incident, the course of<br/>the creek, which he supposed flowed under the trees at the border<br/>of the plain, when he saw Herbert running hastily back, while Neb<br/>and the sailor were hiding behind the rocks.<br/>
