Cyrus Harding and Herbert, while hunting one day, had entered<br/>the forest of the Far West, on the left bank of the Mercy, and, as<br/>usual, the lad was asking a thousand questions of the engineer, who<br/>answered them heartily. Now, as Harding was not a sportsman, and<br/>as, on the other side, Herbert was talking chemistry and natural<br/>philosophy, numbers of kangaroos, capybaras, and agouties came<br/>within range, which, however, escaped the lad's gun; the<br/>consequence was that the day was already advanced, and the two<br/>hunters were in danger of having made a useless excursion, when<br/>Herbert, stopping, and uttering a cry of joy, exclaimed,â€”<br/><br/>"Oh, Captain Harding, do you see that tree?" and he pointed to a<br/>shrub, rather than a tree, for it was composed of a single stem,<br/>covered with a scaly bark, which bore leaves streaked with little<br/>parallel veins.<br/><br/>"And what is this tree which resembles a little palm?" asked<br/>Harding.<br/><br/>"It is a 'cycas revoluta,' of which I have a picture in our<br/>dictionary of Natural History!" said Herbert.<br/><br/>"But I can't see any fruit on this shrub!" observed his<br/>companion.<br/><br/>"No, captain," replied Herbert; "but its stem contains a flour<br/>with which nature has provided us all ready ground."<br/><br/>"It is, then, the bread-tree?"<br/><br/>"Yes, the bread-tree."<br/><br/>"Well, my boy," replied the engineer, "this is a valuable<br/>discovery, since our wheat harvest is not yet ripe; I hope that you<br/>are not mistaken!"<br/><br/>Herbert was not mistaken: he broke the stem of a cycas, which<br/>was composed of a glandulous tissue, containing a quantity of<br/>floury pith, traversed with woody fiber, separated by rings of the<br/>same substance, arranged concentrically. With this fecula was<br/>mingled a mucilaginous juice of disagreeable flavor, but which it<br/>would be easy to get rid of by pressure. This cellular substance<br/>was regular flour of a superior quality, extremely nourishing; its<br/>exportation was formerly forbidden by the Japanese laws.<br/><br/>Cyrus Harding and Herbert, after having examined that part of<br/>the Far West where the cycas grew, took their bearings, and<br/>returned to Granite House, where they made known their<br/>discovery.<br/>
