They had no doubt about it themselves! Ayrton, surprised by the<br/>pirates, had been murdered, and, perhaps, the wretches would profit<br/>by the night to make a descent on the island!<br/><br/>Half an hour was passed in terrible anxiety. The firing had<br/>ceased, and yet neither Ayrton nor Pencroft had reappeared. Was the<br/>islet invaded? Ought they not to fly to the help of Ayrton and<br/>Pencroft? But how? The tide being high at that time, rendered the<br/>channel impassable. The boat was not there!
