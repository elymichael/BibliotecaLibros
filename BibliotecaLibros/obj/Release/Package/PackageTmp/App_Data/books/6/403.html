<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>6<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>However, the chief business of the colonists was to make that<br/>complete exploration of the island which had been decided upon, and<br/>which would have two objects: to discover the mysterious being<br/>whose existence was now indisputable, and at the same time to find<br/>out what had become of the pirates, what retreat they had chosen,<br/>what sort of life they were leading, and what was to be feared from<br/>them. Cyrus Harding wished to set out without delay; but as the<br/>expedition would be of some days duration, it appeared best to load<br/>the cart with different materials and tools in order to facilitate<br/>the organization of the encampments. One of the onagers, however,<br/>having hurt its leg, could not be harnessed at present, and a few<br/>days' rest was necessary. The departure was, therefore, put off for<br/>a week, until the 20th of November. The month of November in this<br/>latitude corresponds to the month of May in the northern zones. It<br/>was, therefore, the fine season. The sun was entering the tropic of<br/>Capricorn, and gave the longest days in the year. The time was,<br/>therefore, very favorable for the projected expedition, which, if<br/>it did not accomplish its principal object, would at any rate be<br/>fruitful in discoveries, especially of natural productions, since<br/>Harding proposed to explore those dense forests of the Far West,<br/>which stretched to the extremity of the Serpentine Peninsula.<br/><br/>During the nine days which preceded their departure, it was<br/>agreed that the work on Prospect Heights should be finished<br/>off.<br/><br/>Moreover, it was necessary for Ayrton to return to the corral,<br/>where the domesticated animals required his care. It was decided<br/>that he should spend two days there, and return to Granite House<br/>after having liberally supplied the stables.<br/><br/>As he was about to start, Harding asked him if he would not like<br/>one of them to accompany him, observing that the island was less<br/>safe than formerly. Ayrton replied that this was unnecessary, as he<br/>was enough for the work, and that besides he apprehended no danger.<br/>If anything occurred at the corral, or in the neighborhood, he<br/>could instantly warn the colonists by sending a telegram to Granite<br/>House.<br/><br/>Ayrton departed at dawn on the 9th, taking the cart drawn by one<br/>onager, and two hours after, the electric wire announced that he<br/>had found all in order at the corral.<br/><br/>During these two days Harding busied himself in executing a<br/>project which would completely guard Granite House against any<br/>surprise. It was necessary to completely conceal the opening of the<br/>old outlet, which was already walled up and partly hidden under<br/>grass and plants, at the southern angle of Lake Grant. Nothing was<br/>easier, since if the level of the lake was raised two or three<br/>feet, the opening would be quite beneath it. Now, to raise this<br/>level they had only to establish a dam at the two openings made by<br/>the lake, and by which were fed Creek Glycerine and Falls<br/>River.<br/><br/>
