The breeze was<br/>light, and as the current had then lost much of its force, Bob<br/>Harvey had absolute command over his vessel.<br/><br/>The route previously followed by the boats had allowed her to<br/>reconnoiter the channel, and she boldly entered it.<br/><br/>The pirate's design was now only too evident; he wished to bring<br/>her broadside to bear on the Chimneys and from there to reply with<br/>shell and ball to the shot which had till then decimated her<br/>crew.<br/><br/>Soon the "Speedy" reached the point of the islet; she rounded it<br/>with ease; the mainsail was braced up, and the brig hugging the<br/>wind, stood across the mouth of the Mercy.<br/><br/>"The scoundrels! they are coming!" said Pencroft.<br/><br/>At that moment, Cyrus Harding, Ayrton, the sailor, and Herbert,<br/>were rejoined by Neb and Gideon Spilett.<br/><br/>The reporter and his companion had judged it best to abandon the<br/>post at the Mercy, from which they could do nothing against the<br/>ship, and they had acted wisely.
