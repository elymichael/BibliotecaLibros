When Pencroft had once got a plan in his head, he had no peace
till it was executed. Now he wished to visit Tabor Island, and as a
boat of a certain size was necessary for this voyage, he determined
to build one.

What wood should he employ? Elm or fir, both of which abounded
in the island? They decided for the fir, as being easy to work, but
which stands water as well as the elm.

These details settled, it was agreed that since the fine season
would not return before six months, Cyrus Harding and Pencroft
should work alone at the boat. Gideon Spilett and Herbert were to
continue to hunt, and neither Neb nor Master Jup, his assistant,
were to leave the domestic duties which had devolved upon them.

Directly the trees were chosen, they were felled, stripped of
their branches, and sawn into planks as well as sawyers would have
been able to do it. A week after, in the recess between the
Chimneys and the cliff, a dockyard was prepared, and a keel
five-and-thirty feet long, furnished with a stern-post at the stern
and a stem at the bows, lay along the sand.

Cyrus Harding was not working in the dark at this new trade. He
knew as much about ship-building as about nearly everything else,
and he had at first drawn the model of his ship on paper. Besides,
he was ably seconded by Pencroft, who, having worked for several
years in a dockyard in Brooklyn, knew the practical part of the
trade. It was not until after careful calculation and deep thought
that the timbers were laid on the keel.

Pencroft, as may be believed, was all eagerness to carry out his
new enterprise, and would not leave his work for an instant.
