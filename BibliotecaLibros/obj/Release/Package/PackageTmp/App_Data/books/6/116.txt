It was the 6th of May, a day which corresponds to the 6th of
November in the countries of the Northern Hemisphere. The sky had
been obscured for some days, and it was of importance to make
preparations for the winter. However, the temperature was not as
yet much lower, and a centigrade thermometer, transported to
Lincoln Island, would still have marked an average of ten to twelve
degrees above zero. This was not surprising, since Lincoln Island,
probably situated between the thirty-fifth and fortieth parallel,
would be subject, in the Southern Hemisphere, to the same climate
as Sicily or Greece in the Northern Hemisphere. But as Greece and
Sicily have severe cold, producing snow and ice, so doubtless would
Lincoln Island in the severest part of the winter and it was
advisable to provide against it.

In any case if cold did not yet threaten them, the rainy season
would begin, and on this lonely island, exposed to all the fury of
the elements, in mid-ocean, bad weather would be frequent, and
probably terrible. The question of a more comfortable dwelling than
the Chimneys must therefore be seriously considered and promptly
resolved on.

Pencroft, naturally, had some predilection for the retreat which
he had discovered, but he well understood that another must be
found. The Chimneys had been already visited by the sea, under
circumstances which are known, and it would not do to be exposed
again to a similar accident.

"Besides," added Cyrus Harding, who this day was talking of
these things with his companions, "we have some precautions to
take."

"Why? The island is not inhabited," said the reporter.

"That is probable," replied the engineer, "although we have not
yet explored the interior; but if no human beings are found, I fear
that dangerous animals may abound. It is necessary to guard against
a possible attack, so that we shall not be obliged to watch every
night, or to keep up a fire. And then, my friends, we must foresee
everything. We are here in a part of the Pacific often frequented
by Malay piratesâ€”"
