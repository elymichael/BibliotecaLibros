Twenty minutes after leaving the hut Pencroft and his companions<br/>reached the western coast of the island, and saw the "Bonadventure"<br/>held fast by her anchor, which was buried deep in the sand.<br/><br/>Pencroft could not restrain a sigh of satisfaction. After all<br/>this vessel was his child, and it is the right of fathers to be<br/>often uneasy when there is no occasion for it.<br/><br/>They returned on board, breakfasted, so that it should not be<br/>necessary to dine until very late; then the repast being ended, the<br/>exploration was continued and conducted with the most minute care.<br/>Indeed, it was very probable that the only inhabitant of the island<br/>had perished. It was therefore more for the traces of a dead than<br/>of a living man that Pencroft and his companions searched. But<br/>their searches were vain, and during the half of that day they<br/>sought to no purpose among the thickets of trees which covered the<br/>islet. There was then scarcely any doubt that, if the castaway was<br/>dead, no trace of his body now remained, but that some wild beast<br/>had probably devoured it to the last bone.<br/><br/>"We will set off to-morrow at daybreak," said Pencroft to his<br/>two companions, as about two o'clock they were resting for a few<br/>minutes under the shade of a clump of firs.<br/><br/>"I should think that we might without scruple take the utensils<br/>which belonged to the castaway," added Herbert.<br/><br/>"I think so, too," returned Gideon Spilett, "and these arms and<br/>tools will make up the stores of Granite House. The supply of<br/>powder and shot is also most important."<br/><br/>"Yes," replied Pencroft, "but we must not forget to capture a<br/>couple or two of those pigs, of which Lincoln Island is<br/>destitute."<br/><br/>"Nor to gather those seeds," added Herbert, "which will give us<br/>all the vegetables of the Old and the New Worlds."<br/><br/>"Then perhaps it would be best," said the reporter, "to remain a<br/>day longer on Tabor Island, so as to collect all that may be useful<br/>to us."<br/><br/>"No, Mr. Spilett," answered Pencroft, "I will ask you to set off<br/>to-morrow at daybreak. The wind seems to me to be likely to shift<br/>to the west, and after having had a fair wind for coming we shall<br/>have a fair wind for going back."<br/><br/>"Then do not let us lose time," said Herbert, rising.<br/>
