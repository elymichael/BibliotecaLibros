"Now, sir," said he, "now that you know my history, your
judgment!"

In saying this, the captain evidently alluded to an important
incident witnessed by the three strangers thrown on board his
vessel, and which the French professor had related in his work,
causing a profound and terrible sensation. Some days previous to
the flight of the professor and his two companions, the "Nautilus,"
being chased by a frigate in the north of the Atlantic had hurled
herself as a ram upon this frigate, and sunk her without mercy.

Cyrus Harding understood the captain's allusion, and was
silent.

"It was an enemy's frigate," exclaimed Captain Nemo, transformed
for an instant into the Prince Dakkar, "an enemy's frigate! It was
she who attacked me—I was in a narrow and shallow bay—the frigate
barred my way— and I sank her!"

A few moments of silence ensued; then the captain demanded,—

"What think you of my life, gentlemen?"

Cyrus Harding extended his hand to the ci-devant prince and
replied gravely, "Sir, your error was in supposing that the past
can be resuscitated, and in contending against inevitable progress.
It is one of those errors which some admire, others blame; which
God alone can judge. He who is mistaken in an action which he
sincerely believes to be right may be an enemy, but retains our
esteem. Your error is one that we may admire, and your name has
nothing to fear from the judgment of history, which does not
condemn heroic folly, but its results."

The old man's breast swelled with emotion, and raising his hand
to heaven,—

"Was I wrong, or in the right?" he murmured.

Cyrus Harding replied, "All great actions return to God, from
whom they are derived. Captain Nemo, we, whom you have succored,
shall ever mourn your loss."

Herbert, who had drawn near the captain, fell on his knees and
kissed his hand.
