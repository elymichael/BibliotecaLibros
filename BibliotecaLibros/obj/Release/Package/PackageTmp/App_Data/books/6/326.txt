Ayrton grasped the hand which Harding extended to him, and great
tears fell from his eyes.

"Will you live with us?" asked Cyrus Harding.

"Captain Harding, leave me some time longer," replied Ayrton,
"leave me alone in the hut in the corral!"

"As you like, Ayrton," answered Cyrus Harding. Ayrton was going
to withdraw, when the engineer addressed one more question to
him:â€”

"One word more, my friend. Since it was your intention to live
alone, why did you throw into the sea the document which put us on
your track?"

"A document?" repeated Ayrton, who did not appear to know what
he meant.

"Yes, the document which we found enclosed in a bottle, giving
us the exact position of Tabor Island!"

Ayrton passed his hand over his brow, then after having thought,
"I never threw any document into the sea!" he answered.

"Never?" exclaimed Pencroft.

"Never!"

And Ayrton, bowing, reached the door and departed.
