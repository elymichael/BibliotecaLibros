<br/>Gideon Spilett and Pencroft listened.<br/><br/>Not a sound could be heard inside the palisade. The musmons and<br/>the goats, sleeping no doubt in their huts, in no way disturbed the<br/>calm of night.<br/><br/>The reporter and the sailor hearing nothing, asked themselves<br/>whether they had not better scale the palisades and penetrate into<br/>the corral. This would have been contrary to Cyrus Harding's<br/>instructions.<br/><br/>It is true that the enterprise might succeed, but it might also<br/>fail. Now, if the convicts were suspecting nothing, if they knew<br/>nothing of the expedition against them, if, lastly, there now<br/>existed a chance of surprising them, ought this chance to be lost<br/>by inconsiderately attempting to cross the palisades?<br/><br/>This was not the reporter's opinion. He thought it better to<br/>wait until all the settlers were collected together before<br/>attempting to penetrate into the corral. One thing was certain,<br/>that it was possible to reach the palisade without being seen, and<br/>also that it did not appear to be guarded. This point settled,<br/>there was nothing to be done but to return to the cart, where they<br/>would consult.<br/><br/>Pencroft probably agreed with this decision, for he followed the<br/>reporter without making any objection when the latter turned back<br/>to the wood.<br/><br/>In a few minutes the engineer was made acquainted with the state<br/>of affairs.<br/><br/>"Well," said he, after a little thought, "I now have reason to<br/>believe that the convicts are not in the corral."<br/><br/>"We shall soon know," said Pencroft, "when we have scaled the<br/>palisade."<br/><br/>"To the corral, my friends!" said Cyrus Harding.<br/><br/>
