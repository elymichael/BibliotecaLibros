<br/>The captain thanked the colonists by a sign, and requested them<br/>to leave him for some hours. Gideon Spilett wished to remain near<br/>him, in the event of a crisis coming on, but the dying man refused,<br/>saying, "I shall live until to-morrow, sir."<br/><br/>All left the saloon, passed through the library and the<br/>dining-room, and arrived forward, in the machine-room where the<br/>electrical apparatus was established, which supplied not only heat<br/>and light, but the mechanical power of the "Nautilus."<br/><br/>The "Nautilus" was a masterpiece containing masterpieces with<br/>itself, and the engineer was struck with astonishment.<br/><br/>The colonists mounted the platform, which rose seven or eight<br/>feet above the water. There they beheld a thick glass lenticular<br/>covering, which protected a kind of large eye, from which flashed<br/>forth light. Behind this eye was apparently a cabin containing the<br/>wheels of the rudder, and in which was stationed the helmsman, when<br/>he navigated the "Nautilus" over the bed of the ocean, which the<br/>electric rays would evidently light up to a considerable<br/>distance.<br/><br/>Cyrus Harding and his companions remained for a time silent, for<br/>they were vividly impressed by what they had just seen and heard,<br/>and their hearts were deeply touched by the thought that he whose<br/>arm had so often aided them, the protector whom they had known but<br/>a few hours, was at the point of death.<br/><br/>Whatever might be the judgment pronounced by posterity upon the<br/>events of this, so to speak, extra-human existence, the character<br/>of Prince Dakkar would ever remain as one of those whose memory<br/>time can never efface.<br/><br/>"What a man!" said Pencroft. "Is it possible that he can have<br/>lived at the bottom of the sea? And it seems to me that perhaps he<br/>has not found peace there any more than elsewhere!"<br/><br/>"The 'Nautilus,'" observed Ayrton, "might have enabled us to<br/>leave Lincoln Island and reach some inhabited country."<br/><br/>"Good Heavens!" exclaimed Pencroft, "I for one would never risk<br/>myself in such a craft. To sail on the seas, good, but under the<br/>seas, never!"<br/><br/>"I believe, Pencroft," answered the reporter, "that the<br/>navigation of a submarine vessel such as the 'Nautilus' ought to be<br/>very easy, and that we should soon become accustomed to it. There<br/>would be no storms, no lee-shore to fear. At some feet beneath the<br/>surface the waters of the ocean are as calm as those of a<br/>lake."<br/><br/>
