These last words justified the colonists' presentiment. There
had been some mournful past, perhaps expiated in the sight of men,
but from which his conscience had not yet absolved him. At any rate
the guilty man felt remorse, he repented, and his new friends would
have cordially pressed the hand which they sought; but he did not
feel himself worthy to extend it to honest men! However, after the
scene with the jaguar, he did not return to the forest, and from
that day did not go beyond the enclosure of Granite House.

What was the mystery of his life? Would the stranger one day
speak of it? Time alone could show. At any rate, it was agreed that
his secret should never be asked from him, and that they would live
with him as if they suspected nothing.

For some days their life continued as before. Cyrus Harding and
Gideon Spilett worked together, sometimes chemists, sometimes
experimentalists. The reporter never left the engineer except to
hunt with Herbert, for it would not have been prudent to allow the
lad to ramble alone in the forest; and it was very necessary to be
on their guard. As to Neb and Pencroft, one day at the stables and
poultry-yard, another at the corral, without reckoning work in
Granite House, they were never in want of employment.

The stranger worked alone, and he had resumed his usual life,
never appearing at meals, sleeping under the trees in the plateau,
never mingling with his companions. It really seemed as if the
society of those who had saved him was insupportable to him!

"But then," observed Pencroft, "why did he entreat the help of
his fellow-creatures? Why did he throw that paper into the
sea?"

"He will tell us why," invariably replied Cyrus Harding.
