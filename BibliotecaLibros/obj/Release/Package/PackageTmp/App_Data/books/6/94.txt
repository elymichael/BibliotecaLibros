"Well, captain, where are we going to begin?" asked Pencroft
next morning of the engineer.

"At the beginning," replied Cyrus Harding.

And in fact, the settlers were compelled to begin "at the very
beginning." They did not possess even the tools necessary for
making tools, and they were not even in the condition of nature,
who, "having time, husbands her strength." They had no time, since
they had to provide for the immediate wants of their existence, and
though, profiting by acquired experience, they had nothing to
invent, still they had everything to make; their iron and their
steel were as yet only in the state of minerals, their earthenware
in the state of clay, their linen and their clothes in the state of
textile material.

It must be said, however, that the settlers were "men" in the
complete and higher sense of the word. The engineer Harding could
not have been seconded by more intelligent companions, nor with
more devotion and zeal. He had tried them. He knew their
abilities.

Gideon Spilett, a talented reporter, having learned everything
so as to be able to speak of everything, would contribute largely
with his head and hands to the colonization of the island. He would
not draw back from any task: a determined sportsman, he would make
a business of what till then had only been a pleasure to him.

Herbert, a gallant boy, already remarkably well informed in the
natural sciences, would render greater service to the common
cause.
