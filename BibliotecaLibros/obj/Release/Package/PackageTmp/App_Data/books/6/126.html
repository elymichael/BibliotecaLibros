"Yes," added the reporter, "we are going to blow up the<br/>island—"<br/><br/>"Blow up the island?" cried Pencroft.<br/><br/>"Part of it, at least," replied Spilett.<br/><br/>"Listen to me, my friends," said the engineer. And he made known<br/>to them the result of his observations.<br/><br/>According to him, a cavity, more or less considerable, must<br/>exist in the mass of granite which supported Prospect Heights, and<br/>he intended to penetrate into it. To do this, the opening through<br/>which the water rushed must first be cleared, and the level lowered<br/>by making a larger outlet. Therefore an explosive substance must be<br/>manufactured, which would make a deep trench in some other part of<br/>the shore. This was what Harding was going to attempt with the<br/>minerals which nature placed at his disposal.<br/><br/>It is useless to say with what enthusiasm all, especially<br/>Pencroft, received this project. To employ great means, open the<br/>granite, create a cascade, that suited the sailor. And he would<br/>just as soon be a chemist as a mason or bootmaker, since the<br/>engineer wanted chemicals. He would be all that they liked, "even a<br/>professor of dancing and deportment," said he to Neb, if that was<br/>ever necessary.<br/><br/>Neb and Pencroft were first of all told to extract the grease<br/>from the dugong, and to keep the flesh, which was destined for<br/>food. Such perfect confidence had they in the engineer, that they<br/>set out directly, without even asking a question. A few minutes<br/>after them, Cyrus Harding, Herbert, and Gideon Spilett, dragging<br/>the hurdle, went towards the vein of coals, where those shistose<br/>pyrites abound which are met with in the most recent transition<br/>soil, and of which Harding had already found a specimen. All the<br/>day being employed in carrying a quantity of these stones to the<br/>Chimneys, by evening they had several tons.<br/><br/>The next day, the 8th of May, the engineer began his<br/>manipulations. These shistose pyrites being composed principally of<br/>coal, flint, alumina, and sulphuret of iron—the latter in excess—it<br/>was necessary to separate the sulphuret of iron, and transform it<br/>into sulphate as rapidly as possible. The sulphate obtained, the<br/>sulphuric acid could then be extracted.<br/><br/>This was the object to be attained. Sulphuric acid is one of the<br/>agents the most frequently employed, and the manufacturing<br/>importance of a nation can be measured by the consumption which is<br/>made of it. This acid would later be of great use to the settlers,<br/>in the manufacturing of candles, tanning skins, etc., but this time<br/>the engineer reserved it for another use.<br/><br/>Cyrus Harding chose, behind the Chimneys, a site where the<br/>ground was perfectly level. On this ground he placed a layer of<br/>branches and chopped wood, on which were piled some pieces of<br/>shistose pyrites, buttressed one against the other, the whole being<br/>covered with a thin layer of pyrites, previously reduced to the<br/>size of a nut.<br/><br/>This done, they set fire to the wood, the heat was communicated<br/>to the shist, which soon kindled, since it contains coal and<br/>sulphur. Then new layers of bruised pyrites were arranged so as to<br/>form an immense heap, the exterior of which was covered with earth<br/>and grass, several air-holes being left, as if it was a stack of<br/>wood which was to be carbonized to make charcoal.<br/>
