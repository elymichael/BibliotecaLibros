The colonists were certainly<br/>right in believing that the mysterious being did not reside on the<br/>surface of the island, and the wildest fancies haunted their<br/>excited imaginations. Pencroft and Neb, particularly, were not<br/>contented with the mystery, but allowed their imaginations to<br/>wander into the domain of the supernatural.<br/><br/>On the 25th of February the colonists re-entered Granite House,<br/>and by means of the double cord, carried by an arrow to the<br/>threshold of the door, they re-established communication between<br/>their habitation and the ground.<br/><br/>A month later they commemorated, on the 25th of March, the third<br/>anniversary of their arrival on Lincoln Island.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
