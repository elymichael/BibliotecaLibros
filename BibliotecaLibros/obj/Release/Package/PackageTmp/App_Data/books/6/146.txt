"Why, captain?" asked Herbert.

"Because the sea, my boy, may be considered as an immense
reservoir, in which is stored the heat of the summer. When winter
comes, it restores this heat, which insures for the regions near
the ocean a medium temperature, less high in summer, but less low
in winter."

"We shall prove that," replied Pencroft. "But I don't want to
bother myself about whether it will be cold or not. One thing is
certain, that is that the days are already short, and the evenings
long. Suppose we talk about the question of light."

"Nothing is easier," replied Harding.

"To talk about?" asked the sailor.

"To settle."

"And when shall we begin?"

"To-morrow, by having a seal hunt."

"To make candles?"

"Yes."

Such was the engineer's project; and it was quite feasible,
since he had lime and sulphuric acid, while the amphibians of the
islet would furnish the fat necessary for the manufacture.
