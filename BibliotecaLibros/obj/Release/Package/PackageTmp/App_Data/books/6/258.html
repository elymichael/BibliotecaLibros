<br/>It was real enjoyment to the settlers when in their room, well<br/>lighted with candles, well warmed with coal, after a good dinner,<br/>elderberry coffee smoking in the cups, the pipes giving forth an<br/>odoriferous smoke, they could hear the storm howling without. Their<br/>comfort would have been complete, if complete comfort could ever<br/>exist for those who are far from their fellow-creatures, and<br/>without any means of communication with them. They often talked of<br/>their country, of the friends whom they had left, of the grandeur<br/>of the American Republic, whose influence could not but increase;<br/>and Cyrus Harding, who had been much mixed up with the affairs of<br/>the Union, greatly interested his auditors by his recitals, his<br/>views, and his prognostics.<br/><br/>It chanced one day that Spilett was led to sayâ€”<br/><br/>"But now, my dear Cyrus, all this industrial and commercial<br/>movement to which you predict a continual advance, does it not run<br/>the danger of being sooner or later completely stopped?"<br/><br/>"Stopped! And by what?"<br/><br/>"By the want of coal, which may justly be called the most<br/>precious of minerals."<br/><br/>"Yes, the most precious indeed," replied the engineer; "and it<br/>would seem that nature wished to prove that it was so by making the<br/>diamond, which is simply pure carbon crystallized."<br/><br/>"You don't mean to say, captain," interrupted Pencroft, "that we<br/>burn diamonds in our stoves in the shape of coal?"<br/><br/>"No, my friend," replied Harding.<br/><br/>"However," resumed Gideon Spilett, "you do not deny that some<br/>day the coal will be entirely consumed?"<br/><br/>"Oh! the veins of coal are still considerable, and the hundred<br/>thousand miners who annually extract from them a hundred millions<br/>of hundredweights have not nearly exhausted them."<br/><br/>
