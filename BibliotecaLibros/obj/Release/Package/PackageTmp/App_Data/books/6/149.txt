"Bread, cakes, tarts!" replied the sailor. "Come, the bread that
this grain of corn will make won't choke us very soon!"

Herbert, not attaching much importance to his discovery, was
going to throw away the grain in question; but Harding took it,
examined it, found that it was in good condition, and looking the
sailor full in the faceâ€” "Pencroft," he asked quietly, "do you know
how many ears one grain of corn can produce?"

"One, I suppose!" replied the sailor, surprised at the
question.

"Ten, Pencroft! And do you know how many grains one ear
bears?"

"No, upon my word."

"About eighty!" said Cyrus Harding. "Then, if we plant this
grain, at the first crop we shall reap eight hundred grains which
at the second will produce six hundred and forty thousand; at the
third, five hundred and twelve millions; at the fourth, more than
four hundred thousands of millions! There is the proportion."

Harding's companions listened without answering. These numbers
astonished them. They were exact, however.

"Yes, my friends," continued the engineer, "such are the
arithmetical progressions of prolific nature; and yet what is this
multiplication of the grain of corn, of which the ear only bears
eight hundred grains, compared to the poppy-plant, which bears
thirty-two thousand seeds; to the tobacco- plant, which produces
three hundred and sixty thousand? In a few years, without the
numerous causes of destruction, which arrests their fecundity,
these plants would overrun the earth."

But the engineer had not finished his lecture.

"And now, Pencroft," he continued, "do you know how many bushels
four hundred thousand millions of grains would make?"
