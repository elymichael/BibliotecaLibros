"And now," said Gideon Spilett, "since the jaguar has left its<br/>abode, I do not see, my friends, why we should not take possession<br/>of it for the night."<br/><br/>"But others may come," said Pencroft.<br/><br/>"It will be enough to light a fire at the entrance of the<br/>cavern," said the reporter, "and no wild beasts will dare to cross<br/>the threshold."<br/><br/>"Into the jaguar's house, then!" replied the sailor, dragging<br/>after him the body of the animal.<br/><br/>While Neb skinned the jaguar, his companions collected an<br/>abundant supply of dry wood from the forest, which they heaped up<br/>at the cave.<br/><br/>Cyrus Harding, seeing the clump of bamboos, cut a quantity,<br/>which he mingled with the other fuel.<br/><br/>This done, they entered the grotto, of which the floor was<br/>strewn with bones, the guns were carefully loaded, in case of a<br/>sudden attack, they had supper, and then just before they lay down<br/>to rest, the heap of wood piled at the entrance was set fire to.<br/>Immediately, a regular explosion, or rather a series of reports,<br/>broke the silence! The noise was caused by the bamboos, which, as<br/>the flames reached them, exploded like fireworks. The noise was<br/>enough to terrify even the boldest of wild beasts.<br/><br/>It was not the engineer who had invented this way of causing<br/>loud explosions, for, according to Marco Polo, the Tartars have<br/>employed it for many centuries to drive away from their encampments<br/>the formidable wild beasts of Central Asia.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
