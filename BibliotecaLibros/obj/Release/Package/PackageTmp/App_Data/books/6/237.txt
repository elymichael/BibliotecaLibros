The weather changed during the first week of March. There had
been a full moon at the commencement of the month, and the heat was
excessive. The atmosphere was felt to be full of electricity, and a
period of some length of tempestuous weather was to be feared.

Indeed, on the 2nd, peals of thunder were heard, the wind blew
from the east, and hail rattled against the facade of Granite House
like volleys of grape-shot. The door and windows were immediately
closed, or everything in the rooms would have been drenched. On
seeing these hailstones, some of which were the size of a pigeon's
egg, Pencroft's first thought was that his cornfield was in serious
danger.

He directly rushed to his field, where little green heads were
already appearing, and by means of a great cloth, he managed to
protect his crop.

This bad weather lasted a week, during which time the thunder
rolled without cessation in the depths of the sky.

The colonists, not having any pressing work out of doors,
profited by the bad weather to work at the interior of Granite
House, the arrangement of which was becoming more complete from day
to day. The engineer made a turning-lathe, with which he turned
several articles both for the toilet and the kitchen, particularly
buttons, the want of which was greatly felt. A gunrack had been
made for the firearms, which were kept with extreme care, and
neither tables nor cupboards were left incomplete. They sawed, they
planed, they filed, they turned; and during the whole of this bad
season, nothing was heard but the grinding of tools or the humming
of the turning-lathe which responded to the growling of the
thunder.

Master Jup had not been forgotten, and he occupied a room at the
back, near the storeroom, a sort of cabin with a cot always full of
good litter, which perfectly suited his taste.
