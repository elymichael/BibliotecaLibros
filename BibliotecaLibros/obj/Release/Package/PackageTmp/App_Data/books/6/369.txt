Ayrton and Pencroft, followed by their companions, descended to
the beach. Ayrton undressed and rubbed himself with grease, so as
to suffer less from the temperature of the water, which was still
cold. He might, indeed, be obliged to remain in it for several
hours.

Pencroft and Neb, during this time, had gone to fetch the boat,
moored a few hundred feet higher up, on the bank of the Mercy, and
by the time they returned, Ayrton was ready to start. A coat was
thrown over his shoulders, and the settlers all came round him to
press his hand.

Ayrton then shoved off with Pencroft in the boat.

It was half-past ten in the evening when the two adventurers
disappeared in the darkness. Their companions returned to wait at
the Chimneys.

The channel was easily traversed, and the boat touched the
opposite shore of the islet. This was not done without precaution,
for fear lest the pirates might be roaming about there. But after a
careful survey, it was evident that the islet was deserted. Ayrton
then, followed by Pencroft, crossed it with a rapid step, scaring
the birds nestled in the holes of the rocks; then, without
hesitating, he plunged into the sea, and swam noiselessly in the
direction of the ship, in which a few lights had recently appeared,
showing her exact situation. As to Pencroft, he crouched down in a
cleft of the rock, and awaited the return of his companion.

In the meanwhile, Ayrton, swimming with a vigorous stroke,
glided through the sheet of water without producing the slightest
ripple. His head just emerged above it and his eyes were fixed on
the dark hull of the brig, from which the lights were reflected in
the water. He thought only of the duty which he had promised to
accomplish, and nothing of the danger which he ran, not only on
board the ship, but in the sea, often frequented by sharks. The
current bore him along and he rapidly receded from the shore.

Half an hour afterwards, Ayrton, without having been either seen
or heard, arrived at the ship and caught hold of the main-chains.
He took breath, then, hoisting himself up, he managed to reach the
extremity of the cutwater. There were drying several pairs of
sailors' trousers. He put on a pair. Then settling himself firmly,
he listened. They were not sleeping on board the brig. On the
contrary, they were talking, singing, laughing. And these were the
sentences, accompanied with oaths, which principally struck
Ayrton:â€”

"Our brig is a famous acquisition."

"She sails well, and merits her name of the 'Speedy.'"

"She would show all the navy of Norfolk a clean pair of
heels."

"Hurrah for her captain!"
