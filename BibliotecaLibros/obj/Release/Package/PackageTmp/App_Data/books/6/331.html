Therefore Cyrus Harding resolved to put the corral in<br/>instantaneous communication with Granite House.<br/><br/>It was on the 10th of January that he made known his project to<br/>his companions.<br/><br/>"Why! how are you going to manage that, captain?" asked<br/>Pencroft. "Do you by chance happen to think of establishing a<br/>telegraph?"<br/><br/>"Exactly so," answered the engineer.<br/><br/>"Electric?" cried Herbert.<br/><br/>"Electric," replied Cyrus Harding. "We have all the necessary<br/>materials for making a battery, and the most difficult thing will<br/>be to stretch the wires, but by means of a drawplate I think we<br/>shall manage it."<br/><br/>"Well, after that," returned the sailor, "I shall never despair<br/>of seeing ourselves some day rolling along on a railway!"<br/><br/>They then set to work, beginning with the most difficult thing,<br/>for, if they failed in that, it would be useless to manufacture the<br/>battery and other accessories.<br/><br/>The iron of Lincoln Island, as has been said, was of excellent<br/>quality, and consequently very fit for being drawn out. Harding<br/>commenced by manufacturing a drawplate, that is to say, a plate of<br/>steel, pierced with conical holes of different sizes, which would<br/>successively bring the wire to the wished-for tenacity. This piece<br/>of steel, after having been tempered, was fixed in as firm a way as<br/>possible in a solid framework planted in the ground, only a few<br/>feet from the great fall, the motive power of which the engineer<br/>intended to utilize. In fact as the fulling- mill was there,<br/>although not then in use, its beam moved with extreme power would<br/>serve to stretch out the wire by rolling it round itself. It was a<br/>delicate operation, and required much care. The iron, prepared<br/>previously in long thin rods, the ends of which were sharpened with<br/>the file, having been introduced into the largest hole of the<br/>drawplate, was drawn out by the beam which wound it round itself,<br/>to a length of twenty-five or thirty feet, then unrolled, and the<br/>same operation was performed successively through the holes of a<br/>less size. Finally, the engineer obtained wires from forty to fifty<br/>feet long, which could be easily fastened together and stretched<br/>over the distance of five miles, which separated the corral from<br/>the bounds of Granite House.<br/><br/>It did not take more than a few days to perform this work, and<br/>indeed as soon as the machine had been commenced, Cyrus Harding<br/>left his companions to follow the trade of wiredrawers, and<br/>occupied himself with manufacturing his battery.<br/><br/>It was necessary to obtain a battery with a constant current. It<br/>is known that the elements of modern batteries are generally<br/>composed of retort coal, zinc, and copper. Copper was absolutely<br/>wanting to the engineer, who, notwithstanding all his researches,<br/>had never been able to find any trace of it in Lincoln Island, and<br/>was therefore obliged to do without it. Retort coal, that is to<br/>say, the hard graphite which is found in the retorts of gas<br/>manufactories, after the coal has been dehydrogenized, could have<br/>been obtained, but it would have been necessary to establish a<br/>special apparatus, involving great labor. As to zinc, it may be<br/>remembered that the case found at Flotsam Point was lined with this<br/>metal, which could not be better utilized than for this<br/>purpose.<br/>
