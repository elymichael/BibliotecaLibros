"That is perfectly logical," answered Spilett; "and the presence<br/>of this castaway explains the arrival of the case on the shores of<br/>our island. There must have been a wreck, since there is a<br/>castaway. As to the latter, whoever he may be, it is lucky for him<br/>that Pencroft thought of building this boat and of trying her this<br/>very day, for a day later and this bottle might have been broken on<br/>the rocks."<br/><br/>"Indeed," said Herbert, "it is a fortunate chance that the<br/>'Bonadventure' passed exactly where the bottle was still<br/>floating!"<br/><br/>"Does not this appear strange to you?" asked Harding of<br/>Pencroft.<br/><br/>"It appears fortunate, that's all," answered the sailor. "Do you<br/>see anything extraordinary in it, captain? The bottle must go<br/>somewhere, and why not here as well as anywhere else?"<br/><br/>"Perhaps you are right, Pencroft," replied the engineer; "and<br/>yetâ€”"<br/><br/>"But," observed Herbert, "there's nothing to prove that this<br/>bottle has been floating long in the sea."<br/><br/>"Nothing," replied Gideon Spilett, "and the document appears<br/>even to have been recently written. What do you think about it,<br/>Cyrus?"<br/><br/>During this conversation Pencroft had not remained inactive. He<br/>had put the vessel about, and the "Bonadventure," all sails set,<br/>was running rapidly towards Claw Cape.<br/><br/>Every one was thinking of the castaway on Tabor Island. Should<br/>they be in time to save him? This was a great event in the life of<br/>the colonists! They themselves were but castaways, but it was to be<br/>feared that another might not have been so fortunate, and their<br/>duty was to go to his succor.<br/><br/>Claw Cape was doubled, and about four o'clock the "Bonadventure"<br/>dropped her anchor at the mouth of the Mercy.<br/><br/>That same evening the arrangements for the new expedition were<br/>made. It appeared best that Pencroft and Herbert, who knew how to<br/>work the vessel, should undertake the voyage alone. By setting out<br/>the next day, the 10th of October, they would arrive on the 13th,<br/>for with the present wind it would not take more than forty-eight<br/>hours to make this passage of a hundred and fifty miles. One day in<br/>the island, three or four to return, they might hope therefore that<br/>on the 17th they would again reach Lincoln Island. The weather was<br/>fine, the barometer was rising, the wind appeared settled,<br/>everything then was in favor of these brave men whom an act of<br/>humanity was taking far from their island.<br/>
