"No, no! Cyrus," answered the reporter, "you must not expose
yourself! Your courage would be of no avail. The villains are
evidently watching the corral, they are hidden in the thick woods
which surround it, and if you go we shall soon have to regret two
misfortunes instead of one!"

"But Neb?" repeated the engineer. "It is now four-and-twenty
hours since he has had any news of us! He will be sure to
come!"

"And as he will be less on his guard than we should be
ourselves," added Spilett, "he will be killed!"

"Is there really no way of warning him?"

While the engineer thought, his eyes fell on Top, who, going
backwards and forwards seemed to say,â€”

"Am not I here?"

"Top!" exclaimed Cyrus Harding.

The animal sprang at his master's call.

"Yes, Top will go," said the reporter, who had understood the
engineer.

"Top can go where we cannot! He will carry to Granite House the
news of the corral, and he will bring back to us that from Granite
House!"

"Quick!" said Harding. "Quick!"
