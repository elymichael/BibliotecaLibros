The moment he was gone, she ran to a closet and got out the ruin
of a jacket which Tom had gone pirating in. Then she stopped, with
it in her hand, and said to herself:

"No, I don't dare. Poor boy, I reckon he's lied about it — but
it's a blessed, blessed lie, there's such a comfort come from it. I
hope the Lord — I know the Lord will forgive him, because it was
such good-heartedness in him to tell it. But I don't want to find
out it's a lie. I won't look."

She put the jacket away, and stood by musing a minute. Twice she
put out her hand to take the garment again, and twice she
refrained. Once more she ventured, and this time she fortified
herself with the thought: "It's a good lie — it's a good lie — I
won't let it grieve me." So she sought the jacket pocket. A moment
later she was reading Tom's piece of bark through flowing tears and
saying: "I could forgive the boy, now, if he'd committed a million
sins!"
