<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>11<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>Close upon the hour of noon the whole village was suddenly<br/>electrified with the ghastly news. No need of the as yet<br/>undreamed-of telegraph; the tale flew from man to man, from group<br/>to group, from house to house, with little less than telegraphic<br/>speed. Of course the schoolmaster gave holiday for that afternoon;<br/>the town would have thought strangely of him if he had not.<br/><br/>A gory knife had been found close to the murdered man, and it<br/>had been recognized by somebody as belonging to Muff Potter — so<br/>the story ran. And it was said that a belated citizen had come upon<br/>Potter washing himself in the "branch" about one or two o'clock in<br/>the morning, and that Potter had at once sneaked off — suspicious<br/>circumstances, especially the washing which was not a habit with<br/>Potter. It was also said that the town had been ransacked for this<br/>"murderer" (the public are not slow in the matter of sifting<br/>evidence and arriving at a verdict), but that he could not be<br/>found. Horsemen had departed down all the roads in every direction,<br/>and the Sheriff "was confident" that he would be captured before<br/>night.<br/><br/>All the town was drifting toward the graveyard. Tom's heartbreak<br/>vanished and he joined the procession, not because he would not a<br/>thousand times rather go anywhere else, but because an awful,<br/>unaccountable fascination drew him on. Arrived at the dreadful<br/>place, he wormed his small body through the crowd and saw the<br/>dismal spectacle. It seemed to him an age since he was there<br/>before. Somebody pinched his arm. He turned, and his eyes met<br/>Huckleberry's. Then both looked elsewhere at once, and wondered if<br/>anybody had noticed anything in their mutual glance. But everybody<br/>was talking, and intent upon the grisly spectacle before them.<br/><br/>"Poor fellow!" "Poor young fellow!" "This ought to be a lesson<br/>to grave robbers!" "Muff Potter'll hang for this if they catch<br/>him!" This was the drift of remark; and the minister said, "It was<br/>a judgment; His hand is here."<br/><br/>Now Tom shivered from head to heel; for his eye fell upon the<br/>stolid face of Injun Joe. At this moment the crowd began to sway<br/>and struggle, and voices shouted, "It's him! it's him! he's coming<br/>himself!"<br/><br/>"Who? Who?" from twenty voices.<br/><br/>
