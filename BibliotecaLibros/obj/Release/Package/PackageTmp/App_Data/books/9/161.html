"Yes!&#160;… Oh, my! Let's run!"<br/><br/>"Keep still! Don't you budge! They're coming right toward the<br/>door."<br/><br/>The boys stretched themselves upon the floor with their eyes to<br/>knot-holes in the planking, and lay waiting, in a misery of<br/>fear.<br/><br/>"They've stopped… . No — coming… . Here they are. Don't whisper<br/>another word, Huck. My goodness, I wish I was out of this!"<br/><br/>Two men entered. Each boy said to himself: "There's the old deaf<br/>and dumb Spaniard that's been about town once or twice lately —<br/>never saw t'other man before."<br/><br/>"T'other" was a ragged, unkempt creature, with nothing very<br/>pleasant in his face. The Spaniard was wrapped in a serape; he had<br/>bushy white whiskers; long white hair flowed from under his<br/>sombrero, and he wore green goggles. When they came in, "t'other"<br/>was talking in a low voice; they sat down on the ground, facing the<br/>door, with their backs to the wall, and the speaker continued his<br/>remarks. His manner became less guarded and his words more distinct<br/>as he proceeded:<br/><br/>"No," said he, "I've thought it all over, and I don't like it.<br/>It's dangerous."<br/><br/>"Dangerous!" grunted the "deaf and dumb" Spaniard — to the vast<br/>surprise of the boys. "Milksop!"<br/><br/>This voice made the boys gasp and quake. It was Injun Joe's!<br/>There was silence for some time. Then Joe said:<br/><br/>"What's any more dangerous than that job up yonder — but<br/>nothing's come of it."<br/><br/>"That's different. Away up the river so, and not another house<br/>about. 'Twon't ever be known that we tried, anyway, long as we<br/>didn't succeed."<br/>
