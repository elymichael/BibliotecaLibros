"Tom, I hoped you loved me that much," said Aunt Polly, with a
grieved tone that discomforted the boy. "It would have been
something if you'd cared enough to think of it, even if you didn't
do it."

"Now, auntie, that ain't any harm," pleaded Mary; "it's only
Tom's giddy way — he is always in such a rush that he never thinks
of anything."

"More's the pity. Sid would have thought. And Sid would have
come and done it, too. Tom, you'll look back, some day, when it's
too late, and wish you'd cared a little more for me when it would
have cost you so little."

"Now, auntie, you know I do care for you," said Tom.

"I'd know it better if you acted more like it."

"I wish now I'd thought," said Tom, with a repentant tone; "but
I dreamt about you, anyway. That's something, ain't it?"

"It ain't much — a cat does that much — but it's better than
nothing. What did you dream?"

"Why, Wednesday night I dreamt that you was sitting over there
by the bed, and Sid was sitting by the woodbox, and Mary next to
him."

"Well, so we did. So we always do. I'm glad your dreams could
take even that much trouble about us."

"And I dreamt that Joe Harper's mother was here."

"Why, she was here! Did you dream any more?"
