<br/>"Oh, it ain't the bread, so much," said Tom; "I reckon it's<br/>mostly what they say over it before they start it out."<br/><br/>"But they don't say anything over it," said Huck. "I've seen 'em<br/>and they don't."<br/><br/>"Well, that's funny," said Tom. "But maybe they say it to<br/>themselves. Of course they do. Anybody might know that."<br/><br/>The other boys agreed that there was reason in what Tom said,<br/>because an ignorant lump of bread, uninstructed by an incantation,<br/>could not be expected to act very intelligently when set upon an<br/>errand of such gravity.<br/><br/>"By jings, I wish I was over there, now," said Joe.<br/><br/>"I do too" said Huck "I'd give heaps to know who it is."<br/><br/>The boys still listened and watched. Presently a revealing<br/>thought flashed through Tom's mind, and he exclaimed:<br/><br/>"Boys, I know who's drownded — it's us!"<br/><br/>They felt like heroes in an instant. Here was a gorgeous<br/>triumph; they were missed; they were mourned; hearts were breaking<br/>on their account; tears were being shed; accusing memories of<br/>unkindness to these poor lost lads were rising up, and unavailing<br/>regrets and remorse were being indulged; and best of all, the<br/>departed were the talk of the whole town, and the envy of all the<br/>boys, as far as this dazzling notoriety was concerned. This was<br/>fine. It was worth while to be a pirate, after all.<br/><br/>As twilight drew on, the ferryboat went back to her accustomed<br/>business and the skiffs disappeared. The pirates returned to camp.<br/>They were jubilant with vanity over their new grandeur and the<br/>illustrious trouble they were making. They caught fish, cooked<br/>supper and ate it, and then fell to guessing at what the village<br/>was thinking and saying about them; and the pictures they drew of<br/>the public distress on their account were gratifying to look upon —<br/>from their point of view. But when the shadows of night closed them<br/>in, they gradually ceased to talk, and sat gazing into the fire,<br/>with their minds evidently wandering elsewhere. The excitement was<br/>gone, now, and Tom and Joe could not keep back thoughts of certain<br/>persons at home who were not enjoying this fine frolic as much as<br/>they were. Misgivings came; they grew troubled and unhappy; a sigh<br/>or two escaped, unawares. By and by Joe timidly ventured upon a<br/>roundabout "feeler" as to how the others might look upon a return<br/>to civilization — not right now, but —<br/><br/>
