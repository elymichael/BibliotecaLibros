<br/>"There — I told you so," said Tom. "Huck recollects it."<br/><br/>"I bleeve I could smoke this pipe all day," said Joe. "I don't<br/>feel sick."<br/><br/>"Neither do I," said Tom. "I could smoke it all day. But I bet<br/>you Jeff Thatcher couldn't."<br/><br/>"Jeff Thatcher! Why, he'd keel over just with two draws. Just<br/>let him try it once. He'd see!"<br/><br/>"I bet he would. And Johnny Miller — I wish could see Johnny<br/>Miller tackle it once."<br/><br/>"Oh, don't I!" said Joe. "Why, I bet you Johnny Miller couldn't<br/>any more do this than nothing. Just one little snifter would fetch<br/>him."<br/><br/>"'Deed it would, Joe. Say — I wish the boys could see us<br/>now."<br/><br/>"So do I."<br/><br/>"Say — boys, don't say anything about it, and some time when<br/>they're around, I'll come up to you and say, 'Joe, got a pipe? I<br/>want a smoke.' And you'll say, kind of careless like, as if it<br/>warn't anything, you'll say, 'Yes, I got my old pipe, and another<br/>one, but my tobacker ain't very good.' And I'll say, 'Oh, that's<br/>all right, if it's strong enough.' And then you'll out with the<br/>pipes, and we'll light up just as ca'm, and then just see 'em<br/>look!"<br/><br/>"By jings, that'll be gay, Tom! I wish it was Now!"<br/><br/>
