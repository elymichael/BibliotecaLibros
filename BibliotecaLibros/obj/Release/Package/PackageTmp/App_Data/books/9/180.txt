"Why, who are you?"

"Huckleberry Finn — quick, let me in!"

"Huckleberry Finn, indeed! It ain't a name to open many doors, I
judge! But let him in, lads, and let's see what's the trouble."

"Please don't ever tell I told you," were Huck's first words
when he got in. "Please don't — I'd be killed, sure — but the
widow's been good friends to me sometimes, and I want to tell — I
will tell if you'll promise you won't ever say it was me."

"By George, he has got something to tell, or he wouldn't act
so!" exclaimed the old man; "out with it and nobody here'll ever
tell, lad."

Three minutes later the old man and his sons, well armed, were
up the hill, and just entering the sumach path on tiptoe, their
weapons in their hands. Huck accompanied them no further. He hid
behind a great bowlder and fell to listening. There was a lagging,
anxious silence, and then all of a sudden there was an explosion of
firearms and a cry.

Huck waited for no particulars. He sprang away and sped down the
hill as fast as his legs could carry him.
