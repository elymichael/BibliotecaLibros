<br/>The widow said she meant to give Huck a home under her roof and<br/>have him educated; and that when she could spare the money she<br/>would start him in business in a modest way. Tom's chance was come.<br/>He said:<br/><br/>"Huck don't need it. Huck's rich."<br/><br/>Nothing but a heavy strain upon the good manners of the company<br/>kept back the due and proper complimentary laugh at this pleasant<br/>joke. But the silence was a little awkward. Tom broke it:<br/><br/>"Huck's got money. Maybe you don't believe it, but he's got lots<br/>of it. Oh, you needn't smile — I reckon I can show you. You just<br/>wait a minute."<br/><br/>Tom ran out of doors. The company looked at each other with a<br/>perplexed interest — and inquiringly at Huck, who was<br/>tongue-tied.<br/><br/>"Sid, what ails Tom?" said Aunt Polly. "He — well, there ain't<br/>ever any making of that boy out. I never —"<br/><br/>Tom entered, struggling with the weight of his sacks, and Aunt<br/>Polly did not finish her sentence. Tom poured the mass of yellow<br/>coin upon the table and said:<br/><br/>"There — what did I tell you? Half of it's Huck's and half of<br/>it's mine!"<br/><br/>The spectacle took the general breath away. All gazed, nobody<br/>spoke for a moment. Then there was a unanimous call for an<br/>explanation. Tom said he could furnish it, and he did. The tale was<br/>long, but brimful of interest. There was scarcely an interruption<br/>from any one to break the charm of its flow. When he had finished,<br/>Mr. Jones said:<br/><br/>"I thought I had fixed up a little surprise for this occasion,<br/>but it don't amount to anything now. This one makes it sing mighty<br/>small, I'm willing to allow."<br/><br/>
