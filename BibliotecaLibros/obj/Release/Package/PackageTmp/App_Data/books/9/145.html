<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>24<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>Tom was a glittering hero once more â€” the pet of the old, the<br/>envy of the young. His name even went into immortal print, for the<br/>village paper magnified him. There were some that believed he would<br/>be President, yet, if he escaped hanging. As usual, the fickle,<br/>unreasoning world took Muff Potter to its bosom and fondled him as<br/>lavishly as it had abused him before. But that sort of conduct is<br/>to the world's credit; therefore it is not well to find fault with<br/>it.<br/><br/>Tom's days were days of splendor and exultation to him, but his<br/>nights were seasons of horror. Injun Joe infested all his dreams,<br/>and always with doom in his eye. Hardly any temptation could<br/>persuade the boy to stir abroad after nightfall. Poor Huck was in<br/>the same state of wretchedness and terror, for Tom had told the<br/>whole story to the lawyer the night before the great day of the<br/>trial, and Huck was sore afraid that his share in the business<br/>might leak out, yet, notwithstanding Injun Joe's flight had saved<br/>him the suffering of testifying in court. The poor fellow had got<br/>the attorney to promise secrecy, but what of that? Since Tom's<br/>harassed conscience had managed to drive him to the lawyer's house<br/>by night and wring a dread tale from lips that had been sealed with<br/>the dismalest and most formidable of oaths, Huck's confidence in<br/>the human race was well-nigh obliterated.<br/><br/>Daily Muff Potter's gratitude made Tom glad he had spoken; but<br/>nightly he wished he had sealed up his tongue.<br/><br/>Half the time Tom was afraid Injun Joe would never be captured;<br/>the other half he was afraid he would be. He felt sure he never<br/>could draw a safe breath again until that man was dead and he had<br/>seen the corpse.<br/><br/>Rewards had been offered, the country had been scoured, but no<br/>Injun Joe was found. One of those omniscient and awe-inspiring<br/>marvels, a detective, came up from St. Louis, moused around, shook<br/>his head, looked wise, and made that sort of astounding success<br/>which members of that craft usually achieve. That is to say, he<br/>"found a clew." But you can't hang a "clew" for murder, and so<br/>after that detective had got through and gone home, Tom felt just<br/>as insecure as he was before.<br/><br/>The slow days drifted on, and each left behind it a slightly<br/>lightened weight of apprehension.<br/><br/>
