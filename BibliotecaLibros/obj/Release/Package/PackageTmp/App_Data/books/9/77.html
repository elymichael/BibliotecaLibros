[* If Mr. Harbison owned a slave named Bull, Tom would have<br/>spoken of him as "Harbison's Bull," but a son or a dog of that name<br/>was "Bull Harbison."]<br/><br/>"Oh, that's good — I tell you, Tom, I was most scared to death;<br/>I'd a bet anything it was a stray dog."<br/><br/>The dog howled again. The boys' hearts sank once more.<br/><br/>"Oh, my! that ain't no Bull Harbison!" whispered Huckleberry.<br/>"Do, Tom!"<br/><br/>Tom, quaking with fear, yielded, and put his eye to the crack.<br/>His whisper was hardly audible when he said:<br/><br/>"Oh, Huck, it's a stray dog!"<br/><br/>"Quick, Tom, quick! Who does he mean?"<br/><br/>"Huck, he must mean us both — we're right together."<br/><br/>"Oh, Tom, I reckon we're goners. I reckon there ain't no mistake<br/>'bout where I'll go to. I been so wicked."<br/><br/>"Dad fetch it! This comes of playing hookey and doing everything<br/>a feller's told not to do. I might a been good, like Sid, if I'd a<br/>tried — but no, I wouldn't, of course. But if ever I get off this<br/>time, I lay I'll just waller in Sunday-schools!" And Tom began to<br/>snuffle a little.<br/><br/>"You bad!" and Huckleberry began to snuffle too. "Consound it,<br/>Tom Sawyer, you're just old pie, 'longside o' what I am. Oh, lordy,<br/>lordy, lordy, I wisht I only had half your chance."<br/>
