<br/>"Something told me 't if I didn't come back and get —" He<br/>shuddered; then waved his nerveless hand with a vanquished gesture<br/>and said, "Tell 'em, Joe, tell 'em — it ain't any use any<br/>more."<br/><br/>Then Huckleberry and Tom stood dumb and staring, and heard the<br/>stony-hearted liar reel off his serene statement, they expecting<br/>every moment that the clear sky would deliver God's lightnings upon<br/>his head, and wondering to see how long the stroke was delayed. And<br/>when he had finished and still stood alive and whole, their<br/>wavering impulse to break their oath and save the poor betrayed<br/>prisoner's life faded and vanished away, for plainly this miscreant<br/>had sold himself to Satan and it would be fatal to meddle with the<br/>property of such a power as that.<br/><br/>"Why didn't you leave? What did you want to come here for?"<br/>somebody said.<br/><br/>"I couldn't help it — I couldn't help it," Potter moaned. "I<br/>wanted to run away, but I couldn't seem to come anywhere but here."<br/>And he fell to sobbing again.<br/><br/>Injun Joe repeated his statement, just as calmly, a few minutes<br/>afterward on the inquest, under oath; and the boys, seeing that the<br/>lightnings were still withheld, were confirmed in their belief that<br/>Joe had sold himself to the devil. He was now become, to them, the<br/>most balefully interesting object they had ever looked upon, and<br/>they could not take their fascinated eyes from his face.<br/><br/>They inwardly resolved to watch him nights, when opportunity<br/>should offer, in the hope of getting a glimpse of his dread<br/>master.<br/><br/>Injun Joe helped to raise the body of the murdered man and put<br/>it in a wagon for removal; and it was whispered through the<br/>shuddering crowd that the wound bled a little! The boys thought<br/>that this happy circumstance would turn suspicion in the right<br/>direction; but they were disappointed, for more than one villager<br/>remarked:<br/><br/>"It was within three feet of Muff Potter when it done it."<br/><br/>Tom's fearful secret and gnawing conscience disturbed his sleep<br/>for as much as a week after this; and at breakfast one morning Sid<br/>said:<br/><br/>"Tom, you pitch around and talk in your sleep so much that you<br/>keep me awake half the time."<br/><br/>
