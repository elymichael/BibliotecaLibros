The artist erected a man in the front yard, that resembled a<br/>derrick. He could have stepped over the house; but the girl was not<br/>hypercritical; she was satisfied with the monster, and<br/>whispered:<br/><br/>"It's a beautiful man — now make me coming along."<br/><br/>Tom drew an hour-glass with a full moon and straw limbs to it<br/>and armed the spreading fingers with a portentous fan. The girl<br/>said:<br/><br/>"It's ever so nice — I wish I could draw."<br/><br/>"It's easy," whispered Tom, "I'll learn you."<br/><br/>"Oh, will you? When?"<br/><br/>"At noon. Do you go home to dinner?"<br/><br/>"I'll stay if you will."<br/><br/>"Good — that's a whack. What's your name?"<br/><br/>"Becky Thatcher. What's yours? Oh, I know. It's Thomas<br/>Sawyer."<br/><br/>"That's the name they lick me by. I'm Tom when I'm good. You<br/>call me Tom, will you?"<br/>
