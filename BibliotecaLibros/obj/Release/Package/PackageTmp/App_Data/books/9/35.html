He was regarded as a wonderful reader. At church "sociables" he<br/>was always called upon to read poetry; and when he was through, the<br/>ladies would lift up their hands and let them fall helplessly in<br/>their laps, and "wall" their eyes, and shake their heads, as much<br/>as to say, "Words cannot express it; it is too beautiful, too<br/>beautiful for this mortal earth." After the hymn had been sung, the<br/>Rev. Mr. Sprague turned himself into a bulletin-board, and read off<br/>"notices" of meetings and societies and things till it seemed that<br/>the list would stretch out to the crack of doom — a queer custom<br/>which is still kept up in America, even in cities, away here in<br/>this age of abundant newspapers. Often, the less there is to<br/>justify a traditional custom, the harder it is to get rid of<br/>it.<br/><br/>And now the minister prayed. A good, generous prayer it was, and<br/>went into details: it pleaded for the church, and the little<br/>children of the church; for the other churches of the village; for<br/>the village itself; for the county; for the State; for the State<br/>officers; for the United States; for the churches of the United<br/>States; for Congress; for the President; for the officers of the<br/>Government; for poor sailors, tossed by stormy seas; for the<br/>oppressed millions groaning under the heel of European monarchies<br/>and Oriental despotisms; for such as have the light and the good<br/>tidings, and yet have not eyes to see nor ears to hear withal; for<br/>the heathen in the far islands of the sea; and closed with a<br/>supplication that the words he was about to speak might find grace<br/>and favor, and be as seed sown in fertile ground, yielding in time<br/>a grateful harvest of good. Amen.<br/><br/>There was a rustling of dresses, and the standing congregation<br/>sat down. The boy whose history this book relates did not enjoy the<br/>prayer, he only endured it — if he even did that much. He was<br/>restive all through it; he kept tally of the details of the prayer,<br/>unconsciously — for he was not listening, but he knew the ground of<br/>old, and the clergyman's regular route over it — and when a little<br/>trifle of new matter was interlarded, his ear detected it and his<br/>whole nature resented it; he considered additions unfair, and<br/>scoundrelly. In the midst of the prayer a fly had lit on the back<br/>of the pew in front of him and tortured his spirit by calmly<br/>rubbing its hands together, embracing its head with its arms, and<br/>polishing it so vigorously that it seemed to almost part company<br/>with the body, and the slender thread of a neck was exposed to<br/>view; scraping its wings with its hind legs and smoothing them to<br/>its body as if they had been coat-tails; going through its whole<br/>toilet as tranquilly as if it knew it was perfectly safe. As indeed<br/>it was; for as sorely as Tom's hands itched to grab for it they did<br/>not dare — he believed his soul would be instantly destroyed if he<br/>did such a thing while the prayer was going on. But with the<br/>closing sentence his hand began to curve and steal forward; and the<br/>instant the "Amen" was out the fly was a prisoner of war. His aunt<br/>detected the act and made him let it go.<br/><br/>The minister gave out his text and droned along monotonously<br/>through an argument that was so prosy that many a head by and by<br/>began to nod — and yet it was an argument that dealt in limitless<br/>fire and brimstone and thinned the predestined elect down to a<br/>company so small as to be hardly worth the saving. Tom counted the<br/>pages of the sermon; after church he always knew how many pages<br/>there had been, but he seldom knew anything else about the<br/>discourse. However, this time he was really interested for a little<br/>while. The minister made a grand and moving picture of the<br/>assembling together of the world's hosts at the millennium when the<br/>lion and the lamb should lie down together and a little child<br/>should lead them. But the pathos, the lesson, the moral of the<br/>great spectacle were lost upon the boy; he only thought of the<br/>conspicuousness of the principal character before the on-looking<br/>nations; his face lit with the thought, and he said to himself that<br/>he wished he could be that child, if it was a tame lion.<br/><br/>Now he lapsed into suffering again, as the dry argument was<br/>resumed. Presently he bethought him of a treasure he had and got it<br/>out. It was a large black beetle with formidable jaws — a<br/>"pinchbug," he called it. It was in a percussion-cap box. The first<br/>thing the beetle did was to take him by the finger. A natural<br/>fillip followed, the beetle went floundering into the aisle and lit<br/>on its back, and the hurt finger went into the boy's mouth. The<br/>beetle lay there working its helpless legs, unable to turn over.<br/>Tom eyed it, and longed for it; but it was safe out of his reach.<br/>Other people uninterested in the sermon found relief in the beetle,<br/>and they eyed it too. Presently a vagrant poodle dog came idling<br/>along, sad at heart, lazy with the summer softness and the quiet,<br/>weary of captivity, sighing for change. He spied the beetle; the<br/>drooping tail lifted and wagged. He surveyed the prize; walked<br/>around it; smelt at it from a safe distance; walked around it<br/>again; grew bolder, and took a closer smell; then lifted his lip<br/>and made a gingerly snatch at it, just missing it; made another,<br/>and another; began to enjoy the diversion; subsided to his stomach<br/>with the beetle between his paws, and continued his experiments;<br/>grew weary at last, and then indifferent and absent-minded. His<br/>head nodded, and little by little his chin descended and touched<br/>the enemy, who seized it. There was a sharp yelp, a flirt of the<br/>poodle's head, and the beetle fell a couple of yards away, and lit<br/>on its back once more. The neighboring spectators shook with a<br/>gentle inward joy, several faces went behind fans and<br/>handkerchiefs, and Tom was entirely happy. The dog looked foolish,<br/>and probably felt so; but there was resentment in his heart, too,<br/>and a craving for revenge. So he went to the beetle and began a<br/>wary attack on it again; jumping at it from every point of a<br/>circle, lighting with his fore-paws within an inch of the creature,<br/>making even closer snatches at it with his teeth, and jerking his<br/>head till his ears flapped again. But he grew tired once more,<br/>after a while; tried to amuse himself with a fly but found no<br/>relief; followed an ant around, with his nose close to the floor,<br/>and quickly wearied of that; yawned, sighed, forgot the beetle<br/>entirely, and sat down on it. Then there was a wild yelp of agony<br/>and the poodle went sailing up the aisle; the yelps continued, and<br/>so did the dog; he crossed the house in front of the altar; he flew<br/>down the other aisle; he crossed before the doors; he clamored up<br/>the home-stretch; his anguish grew with his progress, till<br/>presently he was but a woolly comet moving in its orbit with the<br/>gleam and the speed of light. At last the frantic sufferer sheered<br/>from its course, and sprang into its master's lap; he flung it out<br/>of the window, and the voice of distress quickly thinned away and<br/>died in the distance.<br/><br/>By this time the whole church was red-faced and suffocating with<br/>suppressed laughter, and the sermon had come to a dead standstill.<br/>The discourse was resumed presently, but it went lame and halting,<br/>all possibility of impressiveness being at an end; for even the<br/>gravest sentiments were constantly being received with a smothered<br/>burst of unholy mirth, under cover of some remote pew-back, as if<br/>the poor parson had said a rarely facetious thing. It was a genuine<br/>relief to the whole congregation when the ordeal was over and the<br/>benediction pronounced.<br/><br/>Tom Sawyer went home quite cheerful, thinking to himself that<br/>there was some satisfaction about divine service when there was a<br/>bit of variety in it. He had but one marring thought; he was<br/>willing that the dog should play with his pinchbug, but he did not<br/>think it was upright in him to carry it off.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
