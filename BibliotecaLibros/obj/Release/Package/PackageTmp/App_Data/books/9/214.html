<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>35<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>The reader may rest satisfied that Tom's and Huck's windfall<br/>made a mighty stir in the poor little village of St. Petersburg. So<br/>vast a sum, all in actual cash, seemed next to incredible. It was<br/>talked about, gloated over, glorified, until the reason of many of<br/>the citizens tottered under the strain of the unhealthy excitement.<br/>Every "haunted" house in St. Petersburg and the neighboring<br/>villages was dissected, plank by plank, and its foundations dug up<br/>and ransacked for hidden treasure — and not by boys, but men —<br/>pretty grave, unromantic men, too, some of them. Wherever Tom and<br/>Huck appeared they were courted, admired, stared at. The boys were<br/>not able to remember that their remarks had possessed weight<br/>before; but now their sayings were treasured and repeated;<br/>everything they did seemed somehow to be regarded as remarkable;<br/>they had evidently lost the power of doing and saying commonplace<br/>things; moreover, their past history was raked up and discovered to<br/>bear marks of conspicuous originality. The village paper published<br/>biographical sketches of the boys. The Widow Douglas put Huck's<br/>money out at six per cent., and Judge Thatcher did the same with<br/>Tom's at Aunt Polly's request. Each lad had an income, now, that<br/>was simply prodigious — a dollar for every week-day in the year and<br/>half of the Sundays. It was just what the minister got — no, it was<br/>what he was promised — he generally couldn't collect it. A dollar<br/>and a quarter a week would board, lodge, and school a boy in those<br/>old simple days — and clothe him and wash him, too, for that<br/>matter.<br/><br/>Judge Thatcher had conceived a great opinion of Tom. He said<br/>that no commonplace boy would ever have got his daughter out of the<br/>cave. When Becky told her father, in strict confidence, how Tom had<br/>taken her whipping at school, the Judge was visibly moved; and when<br/>she pleaded grace for the mighty lie which Tom had told in order to<br/>shift that whipping from her shoulders to his own, the Judge said<br/>with a fine outburst that it was a noble, a generous, a magnanimous<br/>lie — a lie that was worthy to hold up its head and march down<br/>through history breast to breast with George Washington's lauded<br/>Truth about the hatchet! Becky thought her father had never looked<br/>so tall and so superb as when he walked the floor and stamped his<br/>foot and said that. She went straight off and told Tom about<br/>it.<br/><br/>Judge Thatcher hoped to see Tom a great lawyer or a great<br/>soldier some day. He said he meant to look to it that Tom should be<br/>admitted to the National Military Academy and afterward trained in<br/>the best law school in the country, in order that he might be ready<br/>for either career or both.<br/><br/>Huck Finn's wealth and the fact that he was now under the Widow<br/>Douglas' protection introduced him into society — no, dragged him<br/>into it, hurled him into it — and his sufferings were almost more<br/>than he could bear. The widow's servants kept him clean and neat,<br/>combed and brushed, and they bedded him nightly in unsympathetic<br/>sheets that had not one little spot or stain which he could press<br/>to his heart and know for a friend. He had to eat with a knife and<br/>fork; he had to use napkin, cup, and plate; he had to learn his<br/>book, he had to go to church; he had to talk so properly that<br/>speech was become insipid in his mouth; whithersoever he turned,<br/>the bars and shackles of civilization shut him in and bound him<br/>hand and foot.<br/><br/>He bravely bore his miseries three weeks, and then one day<br/>turned up missing. For forty-eight hours the widow hunted for him<br/>everywhere in great distress. The public were profoundly concerned;<br/>they searched high and low, they dragged the river for his body.<br/>Early the third morning Tom Sawyer wisely went poking among some<br/>old empty hogsheads down behind the abandoned slaughter-house, and<br/>in one of them he found the refugee. Huck had slept there; he had<br/>just breakfasted upon some stolen odds and ends of food, and was<br/>lying off, now, in comfort, with his pipe. He was unkempt,<br/>uncombed, and clad in the same old ruin of rags that had made him<br/>picturesque in the days when he was free and happy. Tom routed him<br/>out, told him the trouble he had been causing, and urged him to go<br/>home. Huck's face lost its tranquil content, and took a melancholy<br/>cast. He said:<br/><br/>"Don't talk about it, Tom. I've tried it, and it don't work; it<br/>don't work, Tom. It ain't for me; I ain't used to it. The widder's<br/>good to me, and friendly; but I can't stand them ways. She makes me<br/>get up just at the same time every morning; she makes me wash, they<br/>comb me all to thunder; she won't let me sleep in the woodshed; I<br/>got to wear them blamed clothes that just smothers me, Tom; they<br/>don't seem to any air git through 'em, somehow; and they're so<br/>rotten nice that I can't set down, nor lay down, nor roll around<br/>anywher's; I hain't slid on a cellar-door for — well, it 'pears to<br/>be years; I got to go to church and sweat and sweat — I hate them<br/>ornery sermons! I can't ketch a fly in there, I can't chaw. I got<br/>to wear shoes all Sunday. The widder eats by a bell; she goes to<br/>bed by a bell; she gits up by a bell — everything's so awful<br/>reg'lar a body can't stand it."<br/><br/>
