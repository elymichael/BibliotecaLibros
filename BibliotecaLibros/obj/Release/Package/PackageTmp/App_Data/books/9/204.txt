"Look as far around the corner as you can. Do you see that?
There — on the big rock over yonder — done with candle-smoke."

"Tom, it's a cross!"

"Now where's your Number Two? 'Under the cross,' hey? Right
yonder's where I saw Injun Joe poke up his candle, Huck!"

Huck stared at the mystic sign awhile, and then said with a
shaky voice:

"Tom, less git out of here!"

"What! and leave the treasure?"

"Yes — leave it. Injun Joe's ghost is round about there,
certain."

"No it ain't, Huck, no it ain't. It would ha'nt the place where
he died — away out at the mouth of the cave — five mile from
here."

"No, Tom, it wouldn't. It would hang round the money. I know the
ways of ghosts, and so do you."

Tom began to fear that Huck was right. Misgivings gathered in
his mind. But presently an idea occurred to him —

"Lookyhere, Huck, what fools we're making of ourselves! Injun
Joe's ghost ain't a going to come around where there's a
cross!"
