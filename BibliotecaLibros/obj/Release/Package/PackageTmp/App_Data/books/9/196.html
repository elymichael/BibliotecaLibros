<br/>"It's them!" said Tom; "they're coming! Come along, Becky —<br/>we're all right now!"<br/><br/>The joy of the prisoners was almost overwhelming. Their speed<br/>was slow, however, because pitfalls were somewhat common, and had<br/>to be guarded against. They shortly came to one and had to stop. It<br/>might be three feet deep, it might be a hundred — there was no<br/>passing it at any rate. Tom got down on his breast and reached as<br/>far down as he could. No bottom. They must stay there and wait<br/>until the searchers came. They listened; evidently the distant<br/>shoutings were growing more distant! a moment or two more and they<br/>had gone altogether. The heart-sinking misery of it! Tom whooped<br/>until he was hoarse, but it was of no use. He talked hopefully to<br/>Becky; but an age of anxious waiting passed and no sounds came<br/>again.<br/><br/>The children groped their way back to the spring. The weary time<br/>dragged on; they slept again, and awoke famished and woe-stricken.<br/>Tom believed it must be Tuesday by this time.<br/><br/>Now an idea struck him. There were some side passages near at<br/>hand. It would be better to explore some of these than bear the<br/>weight of the heavy time in idleness. He took a kite-line from his<br/>pocket, tied it to a projection, and he and Becky started, Tom in<br/>the lead, unwinding the line as he groped along. At the end of<br/>twenty steps the corridor ended in a "jumping-off place." Tom got<br/>down on his knees and felt below, and then as far around the corner<br/>as he could reach with his hands conveniently; he made an effort to<br/>stretch yet a little farther to the right, and at that moment, not<br/>twenty yards away, a human hand, holding a candle, appeared from<br/>behind a rock! Tom lifted up a glorious shout, and instantly that<br/>hand was followed by the body it belonged to — Injun Joe's! Tom was<br/>paralyzed; he could not move. He was vastly gratified the next<br/>moment, to see the "Spaniard" take to his heels and get himself out<br/>of sight. Tom wondered that Joe had not recognized his voice and<br/>come over and killed him for testifying in court. But the echoes<br/>must have disguised the voice. Without doubt, that was it, he<br/>reasoned. Tom's fright weakened every muscle in his body. He said<br/>to himself that if he had strength enough to get back to the spring<br/>he would stay there, and nothing should tempt him to run the risk<br/>of meeting Injun Joe again. He was careful to keep from Becky what<br/>it was he had seen. He told her he had only shouted "for luck."<br/><br/>But hunger and wretchedness rise superior to fears in the long<br/>run. Another tedious wait at the spring and another long sleep<br/>brought changes. The children awoke tortured with a raging hunger.<br/>Tom believed that it must be Wednesday or Thursday or even Friday<br/>or Saturday, now, and that the search had been given over. He<br/>proposed to explore another passage. He felt willing to risk Injun<br/>Joe and all other terrors. But Becky was very weak. She had sunk<br/>into a dreary apathy and would not be roused. She said she would<br/>wait, now, where she was, and die — it would not be long. She told<br/>Tom to go with the kite-line and explore if he chose; but she<br/>implored him to come back every little while and speak to her; and<br/>she made him promise that when the awful time came, he would stay<br/>by her and hold her hand until all was over.<br/><br/>Tom kissed her, with a choking sensation in his throat, and made<br/>a show of being confident of finding the searchers or an escape<br/>from the cave; then he took the kite-line in his hand and went<br/>groping down one of the passages on his hands and knees, distressed<br/>with hunger and sick with bodings of coming doom.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
