"'Tain't a dream, then, 'tain't a dream! Somehow I most wish it
was. Dog'd if I don't, Huck."

"What ain't a dream?"

"Oh, that thing yesterday. I been half thinking it was."

"Dream! If them stairs hadn't broke down you'd 'a' seen how much
dream it was! I've had dreams enough all night — with that
patch-eyed Spanish devil going for me all through 'em — rot
him!"

"No, not rot him. Find him! Track the money!"

"Tom, we'll never find him. A feller don't have only one chance
for such a pile — and that one's lost. I'd feel mighty shaky if I
was to see him, anyway."

"Well, so'd I; but I'd like to see him, anyway — and track him
out — to his Number Two."

"Number Two — yes, that's it. I been thinking 'bout that. But I
can't make nothing out of it. What do you reckon it is?"

"I dono. It's too deep. Say, Huck — maybe it's the number of a
house!"

"Goody!&#160;… No, Tom, that ain't it. If it is, it ain't in
this one-horse town. They ain't no numbers here."

"Well, that's so. Lemme think a minute. Here — it's the number
of a room — in a tavern, you know!"
