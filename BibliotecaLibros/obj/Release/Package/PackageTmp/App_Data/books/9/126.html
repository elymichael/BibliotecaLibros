The moment he was gone, she ran to a closet and got out the ruin<br/>of a jacket which Tom had gone pirating in. Then she stopped, with<br/>it in her hand, and said to herself:<br/><br/>"No, I don't dare. Poor boy, I reckon he's lied about it — but<br/>it's a blessed, blessed lie, there's such a comfort come from it. I<br/>hope the Lord — I know the Lord will forgive him, because it was<br/>such good-heartedness in him to tell it. But I don't want to find<br/>out it's a lie. I won't look."<br/><br/>She put the jacket away, and stood by musing a minute. Twice she<br/>put out her hand to take the garment again, and twice she<br/>refrained. Once more she ventured, and this time she fortified<br/>herself with the thought: "It's a good lie — it's a good lie — I<br/>won't let it grieve me." So she sought the jacket pocket. A moment<br/>later she was reading Tom's piece of bark through flowing tears and<br/>saying: "I could forgive the boy, now, if he'd committed a million<br/>sins!"<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
