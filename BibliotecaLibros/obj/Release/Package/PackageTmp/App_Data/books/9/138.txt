"Well, I was afeard."

"Why, Tom Sawyer, we wouldn't be alive two days if that got
found out. You know that."

Tom felt more comfortable. After a pause:

"Huck, they couldn't anybody get you to tell, could they?"

"Get me to tell? Why, if I wanted that half-breed devil to
drownd me they could get me to tell. They ain't no different
way."

"Well, that's all right, then. I reckon we're safe as long as we
keep mum. But let's swear again, anyway. It's more surer."

"I'm agreed."

So they swore again with dread solemnities.

"What is the talk around, Huck? I've heard a power of it."

"Talk? Well, it's just Muff Potter, Muff Potter, Muff Potter all
the time. It keeps me in a sweat, constant, so's I want to hide
som'ers."

"That's just the same way they go on round me. I reckon he's a
goner. Don't you feel sorry for him, sometimes?"
