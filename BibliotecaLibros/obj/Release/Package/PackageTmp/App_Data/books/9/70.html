<br/>Potter trembled and grew white.<br/><br/>"I thought I'd got sober. I'd no business to drink to-night. But<br/>it's in my head yet — worse'n when we started here. I'm all in a<br/>muddle; can't recollect anything of it, hardly. Tell me, Joe —<br/>honest, now, old feller — did I do it? Joe, I never meant to — 'pon<br/>my soul and honor, I never meant to, Joe. Tell me how it was, Joe.<br/>Oh, it's awful — and him so young and promising."<br/><br/>"Why, you two was scuffling, and he fetched you one with the<br/>headboard and you fell flat; and then up you come, all reeling and<br/>staggering like, and snatched the knife and jammed it into him,<br/>just as he fetched you another awful clip — and here you've laid,<br/>as dead as a wedge til now."<br/><br/>"Oh, I didn't know what I was a-doing. I wish I may die this<br/>minute if I did. It was all on account of the whiskey and the<br/>excitement, I reckon. I never used a weepon in my life before, Joe.<br/>I've fought, but never with weepons. They'll all say that. Joe,<br/>don't tell! Say you won't tell, Joe — that's a good feller. I<br/>always liked you, Joe, and stood up for you, too. Don't you<br/>remember? You won't tell, will you, Joe?" And the poor creature<br/>dropped on his knees before the stolid murderer, and clasped his<br/>appealing hands.<br/><br/>"No, you've always been fair and square with me, Muff Potter,<br/>and I won't go back on you. There, now, that's as fair as a man can<br/>say."<br/><br/>"Oh, Joe, you're an angel. I'll bless you for this the longest<br/>day I live." And Potter began to cry.<br/><br/>"Come, now, that's enough of that. This ain't any time for<br/>blubbering. You be off yonder way and I'll go this. Move, now, and<br/>don't leave any tracks behind you."<br/><br/>Potter started on a trot that quickly increased to a run. The<br/>half-breed stood looking after him. He muttered:<br/><br/>"If he's as much stunned with the lick and fuddled with the rum<br/>as he had the look of being, he won't think of the knife till he's<br/>gone so far he'll be afraid to come back after it to such a place<br/>by himself — chicken-heart!"<br/><br/>Two or three minutes later the murdered man, the blanketed<br/>corpse, the lidless coffin, and the open grave were under no<br/>inspection but the moon's. The stillness was complete again,<br/>too.<br/><br/>
