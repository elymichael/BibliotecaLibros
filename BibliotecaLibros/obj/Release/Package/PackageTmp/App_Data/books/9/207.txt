They presently emerged into the clump of sumach bushes, looked
warily out, found the coast clear, and were soon lunching and
smoking in the skiff. As the sun dipped toward the horizon they
pushed out and got under way. Tom skimmed up the shore through the
long twilight, chatting cheerily with Huck, and landed shortly
after dark.

"Now, Huck," said Tom, "we'll hide the money in the loft of the
widow's woodshed, and I'll come up in the morning and we'll count
it and divide, and then we'll hunt up a place out in the woods for
it where it will be safe. Just you lay quiet here and watch the
stuff till I run and hook Benny Taylor's little wagon; I won't be
gone a minute."

He disappeared, and presently returned with the wagon, put the
two small sacks into it, threw some old rags on top of them, and
started off, dragging his cargo behind him. When the boys reached
the Welshman's house, they stopped to rest. Just as they were about
to move on, the Welshman stepped out and said:

"Hallo, who's that?"

"Huck and Tom Sawyer."

"Good! Come along with me, boys, you are keeping everybody
waiting. Here — hurry up, trot ahead — I'll haul the wagon for you.
Why, it's not as light as it might be. Got bricks in it? — or old
metal?"

"Old metal," said Tom.

"I judged so; the boys in this town will take more trouble and
fool away more time hunting up six bits' worth of old iron to sell
to the foundry than they would to make twice the money at regular
work. But that's human nature — hurry along, hurry along!"

The boys wanted to know what the hurry was about.

"Never mind; you'll see, when we get to the Widow Douglas'."
