"It's all the same, I reckon; some says gal, some says girl —
both's right, like enough. Anyway, what's her name, Tom?"

"I'll tell you some time — not now."

"All right — that'll do. Only if you get married I'll be more
lonesomer than ever."

"No you won't. You'll come and live with me. Now stir out of
this and we'll go to digging."

They worked and sweated for half an hour. No result. They toiled
another half-hour. Still no result. Huck said:

"Do they always bury it as deep as this?"

"Sometimes — not always. Not generally. I reckon we haven't got
the right place."

So they chose a new spot and began again. The labor dragged a
little, but still they made progress. They pegged away in silence
for some time. Finally Huck leaned on his shovel, swabbed the
beaded drops from his brow with his sleeve, and said:

"Where you going to dig next, after we get this one?"

"I reckon maybe we'll tackle the old tree that's over yonder on
Cardiff Hill back of the widow's."
