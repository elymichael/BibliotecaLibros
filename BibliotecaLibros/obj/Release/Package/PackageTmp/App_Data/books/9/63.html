"Why, that ain't anything. I can't fall; that ain't the way it<br/>is in the book. The book says, 'Then with one back-handed stroke he<br/>slew poor Guy of Guisborne.' You're to turn around and let me hit<br/>you in the back."<br/><br/>There was no getting around the authorities, so Joe turned,<br/>received the whack and fell.<br/><br/>"Now," said Joe, getting up, "you got to let me kill you. That's<br/>fair."<br/><br/>"Why, I can't do that, it ain't in the book."<br/><br/>"Well, it's blamed mean â€” that's all."<br/><br/>"Well, say, Joe, you can be Friar Tuck or Much the miller's son,<br/>and lam me with a quarter-staff; or I'll be the Sheriff of<br/>Nottingham and you be Robin Hood a little while and kill me."<br/><br/>This was satisfactory, and so these adventures were carried out.<br/>Then Tom became Robin Hood again, and was allowed by the<br/>treacherous nun to bleed his strength away through his neglected<br/>wound. And at last Joe, representing a whole tribe of weeping<br/>outlaws, dragged him sadly forth, gave his bow into his feeble<br/>hands, and Tom said, "Where this arrow falls, there bury poor Robin<br/>Hood under the greenwood tree." Then he shot the arrow and fell<br/>back and would have died, but he lit on a nettle and sprang up too<br/>gaily for a corpse.<br/><br/>The boys dressed themselves, hid their accoutrements, and went<br/>off grieving that there were no outlaws any more, and wondering<br/>what modern civilization could claim to have done to compensate for<br/>their loss. They said they would rather be outlaws a year in<br/>Sherwood Forest than President of the United States forever.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
