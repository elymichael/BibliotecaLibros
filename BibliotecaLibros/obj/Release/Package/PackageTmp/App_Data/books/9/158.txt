About noon the next day the boys arrived at the dead tree; they
had come for their tools. Tom was impatient to go to the haunted
house; Huck was measurably so, also — but suddenly said:
"Lookyhere, Tom, do you know what day it is?"

Tom mentally ran over the days of the week, and then quickly
lifted his eyes with a startled look in them —

"My! I never once thought of it, Huck!"

"Well, I didn't neither, but all at once it popped onto me that
it was Friday."

"Blame it, a body can't be too careful, Huck. We might 'a' got
into an awful scrape, tackling such a thing on a Friday."

"Might! Better say we would! There's some lucky days, maybe, but
Friday ain't."
