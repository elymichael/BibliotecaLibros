<br/>"No — Number Two — under the cross. The other place is bad — too<br/>common."<br/><br/>"All right. It's nearly dark enough to start."<br/><br/>Injun Joe got up and went about from window to window cautiously<br/>peeping out. Presently he said:<br/><br/>"Who could have brought those tools here? Do you reckon they can<br/>be up-stairs?"<br/><br/>The boys' breath forsook them. Injun Joe put his hand on his<br/>knife, halted a moment, undecided, and then turned toward the<br/>stairway. The boys thought of the closet, but their strength was<br/>gone. The steps came creaking up the stairs — the intolerable<br/>distress of the situation woke the stricken resolution of the lads<br/>— they were about to spring for the closet, when there was a crash<br/>of rotten timbers and Injun Joe landed on the ground amid the<br/>debris of the ruined stairway. He gathered himself up cursing, and<br/>his comrade said:<br/><br/>"Now what's the use of all that? If it's anybody, and they're up<br/>there, let them stay there — who cares? If they want to jump down,<br/>now, and get into trouble, who objects? It will be dark in fifteen<br/>minutes — and then let them follow us if they want to. I'm willing.<br/>In my opinion, whoever hove those things in here caught a sight of<br/>us and took us for ghosts or devils or something. I'll bet they're<br/>running yet."<br/><br/>Joe grumbled awhile; then he agreed with his friend that what<br/>daylight was left ought to be economized in getting things ready<br/>for leaving. Shortly afterward they slipped out of the house in the<br/>deepening twilight, and moved toward the river with their precious<br/>box.<br/><br/>Tom and Huck rose up, weak but vastly relieved, and stared after<br/>them through the chinks between the logs of the house. Follow? Not<br/>they. They were content to reach ground again without broken necks,<br/>and take the townward track over the hill. They did not talk much.<br/>They were too much absorbed in hating themselves — hating the ill<br/>luck that made them take the spade and the pick there. But for<br/>that, Injun Joe never would have suspected. He would have hidden<br/>the silver with the gold to wait there till his "revenge" was<br/>satisfied, and then he would have had the misfortune to find that<br/>money turn up missing. Bitter, bitter luck that the tools were ever<br/>brought there!<br/><br/>They resolved to keep a lookout for that Spaniard when he should<br/>come to town spying out for chances to do his revengeful job, and<br/>follow him to "Number Two," wherever that might be. Then a ghastly<br/>thought occurred to Tom.<br/><br/>"Revenge? What if he means us, Huck!"<br/><br/>
