"Yes, and you done more than that," said Injun Joe, approaching<br/>the doctor, who was now standing. "Five years ago you drove me away<br/>from your father's kitchen one night, when I come to ask for<br/>something to eat, and you said I warn't there for any good; and<br/>when I swore I'd get even with you if it took a hundred years, your<br/>father had me jailed for a vagrant. Did you think I'd forget? The<br/>Injun blood ain't in me for nothing. And now I've got you, and you<br/>got to settle, you know!"<br/><br/>He was threatening the doctor, with his fist in his face, by<br/>this time. The doctor struck out suddenly and stretched the ruffian<br/>on the ground. Potter dropped his knife, and exclaimed:<br/><br/>"Here, now, don't you hit my pard!" and the next moment he had<br/>grappled with the doctor and the two were struggling with might and<br/>main, trampling the grass and tearing the ground with their heels.<br/>Injun Joe sprang to his feet, his eyes flaming with passion,<br/>snatched up Potter's knife, and went creeping, catlike and<br/>stooping, round and round about the combatants, seeking an<br/>opportunity. All at once the doctor flung himself free, seized the<br/>heavy headboard of Williams' grave and felled Potter to the earth<br/>with it — and in the same instant the half-breed saw his chance and<br/>drove the knife to the hilt in the young man's breast. He reeled<br/>and fell partly upon Potter, flooding him with his blood, and in<br/>the same moment the clouds blotted out the dreadful spectacle and<br/>the two frightened boys went speeding away in the dark.<br/><br/>Presently, when the moon emerged again, Injun Joe was standing<br/>over the two forms, contemplating them. The doctor murmured<br/>inarticulately, gave a long gasp or two and was still. The<br/>half-breed muttered:<br/><br/>"That score is settled — damn you."<br/><br/>Then he robbed the body. After which he put the fatal knife in<br/>Potter's open right hand, and sat down on the dismantled coffin.<br/>Three — four — five minutes passed, and then Potter began to stir<br/>and moan. His hand closed upon the knife; he raised it, glanced at<br/>it, and let it fall, with a shudder. Then he sat up, pushing the<br/>body from him, and gazed at it, and then around him, confusedly.<br/>His eyes met Joe's.<br/><br/>"Lord, how is this, Joe?" he said.<br/><br/>"It's a dirty business," said Joe, without moving.<br/><br/>"What did you do it for?"<br/><br/>"I! I never done it!"<br/><br/>"Look here! That kind of talk won't wash."<br/>
