"Tom, I hoped you loved me that much," said Aunt Polly, with a<br/>grieved tone that discomforted the boy. "It would have been<br/>something if you'd cared enough to think of it, even if you didn't<br/>do it."<br/><br/>"Now, auntie, that ain't any harm," pleaded Mary; "it's only<br/>Tom's giddy way — he is always in such a rush that he never thinks<br/>of anything."<br/><br/>"More's the pity. Sid would have thought. And Sid would have<br/>come and done it, too. Tom, you'll look back, some day, when it's<br/>too late, and wish you'd cared a little more for me when it would<br/>have cost you so little."<br/><br/>"Now, auntie, you know I do care for you," said Tom.<br/><br/>"I'd know it better if you acted more like it."<br/><br/>"I wish now I'd thought," said Tom, with a repentant tone; "but<br/>I dreamt about you, anyway. That's something, ain't it?"<br/><br/>"It ain't much — a cat does that much — but it's better than<br/>nothing. What did you dream?"<br/><br/>"Why, Wednesday night I dreamt that you was sitting over there<br/>by the bed, and Sid was sitting by the woodbox, and Mary next to<br/>him."<br/><br/>"Well, so we did. So we always do. I'm glad your dreams could<br/>take even that much trouble about us."<br/><br/>"And I dreamt that Joe Harper's mother was here."<br/><br/>"Why, she was here! Did you dream any more?"<br/>
