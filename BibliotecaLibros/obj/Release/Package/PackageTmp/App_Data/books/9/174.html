<br/>"Well, I reckon maybe that's so. Who'd 'a' thought such a thing?<br/>But say, Tom, now's a mighty good time to get that box, if Injun<br/>Joe's drunk."<br/><br/>"It is, that! You try it!"<br/><br/>Huck shuddered.<br/><br/>"Well, no — I reckon not."<br/><br/>"And I reckon not, Huck. Only one bottle alongside of Injun Joe<br/>ain't enough. If there'd been three, he'd be drunk enough and I'd<br/>do it."<br/><br/>There was a long pause for reflection, and then Tom said:<br/><br/>"Lookyhere, Huck, less not try that thing any more till we know<br/>Injun Joe's not in there. It's too scary. Now, if we watch every<br/>night, we'll be dead sure to see him go out, some time or other,<br/>and then we'll snatch that box quicker'n lightning."<br/><br/>"Well, I'm agreed. I'll watch the whole night long, and I'll do<br/>it every night, too, if you'll do the other part of the job."<br/><br/>"All right, I will. All you got to do is to trot up Hooper<br/>Street a block and maow — and if I'm asleep, you throw some gravel<br/>at the window and that'll fetch me."<br/><br/>"Agreed, and good as wheat!"<br/><br/>
