"What do you call work?"<br/><br/>"Why, ain't that work?"<br/><br/>Tom resumed his whitewashing, and answered carelessly:<br/><br/>"Well, maybe it is, and maybe it ain't. All I know, is, it suits<br/>Tom Sawyer."<br/><br/>"Oh come, now, you don't mean to let on that you like it?"<br/><br/>The brush continued to move.<br/><br/>"Like it? Well, I don't see why I oughtn't to like it. Does a<br/>boy get a chance to whitewash a fence every day?"<br/><br/>That put the thing in a new light. Ben stopped nibbling his<br/>apple. Tom swept his brush daintily back and forth — stepped back<br/>to note the effect — added a touch here and there — criticised the<br/>effect again — Ben watching every move and getting more and more<br/>interested, more and more absorbed. Presently he said:<br/><br/>"Say, Tom, let me whitewash a little."<br/><br/>Tom considered, was about to consent; but he altered his<br/>mind:<br/><br/>"No — no — I reckon it wouldn't hardly do, Ben. You see, Aunt<br/>Polly's awful particular about this fence — right here on the<br/>street, you know — but if it was the back fence I wouldn't mind and<br/>she wouldn't. Yes, she's awful particular about this fence; it's<br/>got to be done very careful; I reckon there ain't one boy in a<br/>thousand, maybe two thousand, that can do it the way it's got to be<br/>done."<br/>
