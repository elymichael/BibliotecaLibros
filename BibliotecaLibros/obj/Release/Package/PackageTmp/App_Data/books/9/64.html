<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>9<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>At half-past nine, that night, Tom and Sid were sent to bed, as<br/>usual. They said their prayers, and Sid was soon asleep. Tom lay<br/>awake and waited, in restless impatience. When it seemed to him<br/>that it must be nearly daylight, he heard the clock strike ten!<br/>This was despair. He would have tossed and fidgeted, as his nerves<br/>demanded, but he was afraid he might wake Sid. So he lay still, and<br/>stared up into the dark. Everything was dismally still. By and by,<br/>out of the stillness, little, scarcely preceptible noises began to<br/>emphasize themselves. The ticking of the clock began to bring<br/>itself into notice. Old beams began to crack mysteriously. The<br/>stairs creaked faintly. Evidently spirits were abroad. A measured,<br/>muffled snore issued from Aunt Polly's chamber. And now the<br/>tiresome chirping of a cricket that no human ingenuity could<br/>locate, began. Next the ghastly ticking of a deathwatch in the wall<br/>at the bed's head made Tom shudder â€” it meant that somebody's days<br/>were numbered. Then the howl of a far-off dog rose on the night<br/>air, and was answered by a fainter howl from a remoter distance.<br/>Tom was in an agony. At last he was satisfied that time had ceased<br/>and eternity begun; he began to doze, in spite of himself; the<br/>clock chimed eleven, but he did not hear it. And then there came,<br/>mingling with his half-formed dreams, a most melancholy<br/>caterwauling. The raising of a neighboring window disturbed him. A<br/>cry of "Scat! you devil!" and the crash of an empty bottle against<br/>the back of his aunt's woodshed brought him wide awake, and a<br/>single minute later he was dressed and out of the window and<br/>creeping along the roof of the "ell" on all fours. He "meow'd" with<br/>caution once or twice, as he went; then jumped to the roof of the<br/>woodshed and thence to the ground. Huckleberry Finn was there, with<br/>his dead cat. The boys moved off and disappeared in the gloom. At<br/>the end of half an hour they were wading through the tall grass of<br/>the graveyard.<br/><br/>It was a graveyard of the old-fashioned Western kind. It was on<br/>a hill, about a mile and a half from the village. It had a crazy<br/>board fence around it, which leaned inward in places, and outward<br/>the rest of the time, but stood upright nowhere. Grass and weeds<br/>grew rank over the whole cemetery. All the old graves were sunken<br/>in, there was not a tombstone on the place; round-topped,<br/>worm-eaten boards staggered over the graves, leaning for support<br/>and finding none. "Sacred to the memory of" So-and-So had been<br/>painted on them once, but it could no longer have been read, on the<br/>most of them, now, even if there had been light.<br/><br/>A faint wind moaned through the trees, and Tom feared it might<br/>be the spirits of the dead, complaining at being disturbed. The<br/>boys talked little, and only under their breath, for the time and<br/>the place and the pervading solemnity and silence oppressed their<br/>spirits. They found the sharp new heap they were seeking, and<br/>ensconced themselves within the protection of three great elms that<br/>grew in a bunch within a few feet of the grave.<br/><br/>Then they waited in silence for what seemed a long time. The<br/>hooting of a distant owl was all the sound that troubled the dead<br/>stillness. Tom's reflections grew oppressive. He must force some<br/>talk. So he said in a whisper:<br/><br/>"Hucky, do you believe the dead people like it for us to be<br/>here?"<br/><br/>Huckleberry whispered:<br/><br/>
