The old lady pulled her spectacles down and looked over them<br/>about the room; then she put them up and looked out under them. She<br/>seldom or never looked through them for so small a thing as a boy;<br/>they were her state pair, the pride of her heart, and were built<br/>for "style," not service — she could have seen through a pair of<br/>stove-lids just as well. She looked perplexed for a moment, and<br/>then said, not fiercely, but still loud enough for the furniture to<br/>hear:<br/><br/>"Well, I lay if I get hold of you I'll —"<br/><br/>She did not finish, for by this time she was bending down and<br/>punching under the bed with the broom, and so she needed breath to<br/>punctuate the punches with. She resurrected nothing but the<br/>cat.<br/><br/>"I never did see the beat of that boy!"<br/><br/>She went to the open door and stood in it and looked out among<br/>the tomato vines and "jimpson" weeds that constituted the garden.<br/>No Tom. So she lifted up her voice at an angle calculated for<br/>distance and shouted:<br/><br/>"Y-o-u-u Tom!"<br/><br/>There was a slight noise behind her and she turned just in time<br/>to seize a small boy by the slack of his roundabout and arrest his<br/>flight.<br/><br/>"There! I might 'a' thought of that closet. What you been doing<br/>in there?"<br/><br/>"Nothing."<br/><br/>"Nothing! Look at your hands. And look at your mouth. What is<br/>that truck?"<br/><br/>"I don't know, aunt."<br/>
