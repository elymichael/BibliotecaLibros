Then he tossed the marble away pettishly, and stood cogitating.<br/>The truth was, that a superstition of his had failed, here, which<br/>he and all his comrades had always looked upon as infallible. If<br/>you buried a marble with certain necessary incantations, and left<br/>it alone a fortnight, and then opened the place with the<br/>incantation he had just used, you would find that all the marbles<br/>you had ever lost had gathered themselves together there, meantime,<br/>no matter how widely they had been separated. But now, this thing<br/>had actually and unquestionably failed. Tom's whole structure of<br/>faith was shaken to its foundations. He had many a time heard of<br/>this thing succeeding but never of its failing before. It did not<br/>occur to him that he had tried it several times before, himself,<br/>but could never find the hiding-places afterward. He puzzled over<br/>the matter some time, and finally decided that some witch had<br/>interfered and broken the charm. He thought he would satisfy<br/>himself on that point; so he searched around till he found a small<br/>sandy spot with a little funnel-shaped depression in it. He laid<br/>himself down and put his mouth close to this depression and called<br/>—<br/><br/>"Doodle-bug, doodle-bug, tell me what I want to know!<br/>Doodle-bug, doodle-bug, tell me what I want to know!"<br/><br/>The sand began to work, and presently a small black bug appeared<br/>for a second and then darted under again in a fright.<br/><br/>"He dasn't tell! So it was a witch that done it. I just knowed<br/>it."<br/><br/>He well knew the futility of trying to contend against witches,<br/>so he gave up discouraged. But it occurred to him that he might as<br/>well have the marble he had just thrown away, and therefore he went<br/>and made a patient search for it. But he could not find it. Now he<br/>went back to his treasure-house and carefully placed himself just<br/>as he had been standing when he tossed the marble away; then he<br/>took another marble from his pocket and tossed it in the same way,<br/>saying:<br/><br/>"Brother, go find your brother!"<br/><br/>He watched where it stopped, and went there and looked. But it<br/>must have fallen short or gone too far; so he tried twice more. The<br/>last repetition was successful. The two marbles lay within a foot<br/>of each other.<br/><br/>Just here the blast of a toy tin trumpet came faintly down the<br/>green aisles of the forest. Tom flung off his jacket and trousers,<br/>turned a suspender into a belt, raked away some brush behind the<br/>rotten log, disclosing a rude bow and arrow, a lath sword and a tin<br/>trumpet, and in a moment had seized these things and bounded away,<br/>barelegged, with fluttering shirt. He presently halted under a<br/>great elm, blew an answering blast, and then began to tiptoe and<br/>look warily out, this way and that. He said cautiously — to an<br/>imaginary company:<br/><br/>"Hold, my merry men! Keep hid till I blow."<br/><br/>Now appeared Joe Harper, as airily clad and elaborately armed as<br/>Tom. Tom called:<br/><br/>"Hold! Who comes here into Sherwood Forest without my pass?"<br/>
