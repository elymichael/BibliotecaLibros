<br/>"And besides, look-a-here — maybe that whack done for him!"<br/><br/>"No, 'taint likely, Tom. He had liquor in him; I could see that;<br/>and besides, he always has. Well, when pap's full, you might take<br/>and belt him over the head with a church and you couldn't phase<br/>him. He says so, his own self. So it's the same with Muff Potter,<br/>of course.
