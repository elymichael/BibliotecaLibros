<br/>The point was well taken. It had its effect.<br/><br/>"Tom, I didn't think of that. But that's so. It's luck for us,<br/>that cross is. I reckon we'll climb down there and have a hunt for<br/>that box."<br/><br/>Tom went first, cutting rude steps in the clay hill as he<br/>descended. Huck followed. Four avenues opened out of the small<br/>cavern which the great rock stood in. The boys examined three of<br/>them with no result. They found a small recess in the one nearest<br/>the base of the rock, with a pallet of blankets spread down in it;<br/>also an old suspender, some bacon rind, and the well-gnawed bones<br/>of two or three fowls.

Some boards were soon<br/>uncovered and removed. They had concealed a natural chasm which led<br/>under the rock. Tom got into this and held his candle as far under<br/>the rock as he could, but said he could not see to the end of the<br/>rift. He proposed to explore. He stooped and passed under; the<br/>narrow way descended gradually. He followed its winding course,<br/>first to the right, then to the left, Huck at his heels. Tom turned<br/>a short curve, by-and-by, and exclaimed:<br/><br/>
