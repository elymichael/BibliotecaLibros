I wish,<br/>now, you'd waked up when I kissed you — I do, honest."<br/><br/>The hard lines in his aunt's face relaxed and a sudden<br/>tenderness dawned in her eyes.<br/><br/>"Did you kiss me, Tom?"<br/><br/>"Why, yes, I did."<br/><br/>"Are you sure you did, Tom?"<br/><br/>"Why, yes, I did, auntie — certain sure."<br/><br/>"What did you kiss me for, Tom?"<br/><br/>"Because I loved you so, and you laid there moaning and I was so<br/>sorry."<br/><br/>The words sounded like truth.
