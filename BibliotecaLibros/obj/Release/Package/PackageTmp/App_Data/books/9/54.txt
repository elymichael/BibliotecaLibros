"Put on your bonnet and let on you're going home; and when you
get to the corner, give the rest of 'em the slip, and turn down
through the lane and come back. I'll go the other way and come it
over 'em the same way."

So the one went off with one group of scholars, and the other
with another. In a little while the two met at the bottom of the
lane, and when they reached the school they had it all to
themselves. Then they sat together, with a slate before them, and
Tom gave Becky the pencil and held her hand in his, guiding it, and
so created another surprising house. When the interest in art began
to wane, the two fell to talking. Tom was swimming in bliss. He
said:

"Do you love rats?"

"No! I hate them!"

"Well, I do, too â€” live ones. But I mean dead ones, to swing
round your head with a string."

"No, I don't care for rats much, anyway. What I like is
chewing-gum."

"Oh, I should say so! I wish I had some now."

"Do you? I've got some. I'll let you chew it awhile, but you
must give it back to me."

That was agreeable, so they chewed it turn about, and dangled
their legs against the bench in excess of contentment.

"Was you ever at a circus?" said Tom.
