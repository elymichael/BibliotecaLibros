"Why, that ain't anything. I can't fall; that ain't the way it
is in the book. The book says, 'Then with one back-handed stroke he
slew poor Guy of Guisborne.' You're to turn around and let me hit
you in the back."

There was no getting around the authorities, so Joe turned,
received the whack and fell.

"Now," said Joe, getting up, "you got to let me kill you. That's
fair."

"Why, I can't do that, it ain't in the book."

"Well, it's blamed mean â€” that's all."

"Well, say, Joe, you can be Friar Tuck or Much the miller's son,
and lam me with a quarter-staff; or I'll be the Sheriff of
Nottingham and you be Robin Hood a little while and kill me."

This was satisfactory, and so these adventures were carried out.
Then Tom became Robin Hood again, and was allowed by the
treacherous nun to bleed his strength away through his neglected
wound. And at last Joe, representing a whole tribe of weeping
outlaws, dragged him sadly forth, gave his bow into his feeble
hands, and Tom said, "Where this arrow falls, there bury poor Robin
Hood under the greenwood tree." Then he shot the arrow and fell
back and would have died, but he lit on a nettle and sprang up too
gaily for a corpse.

The boys dressed themselves, hid their accoutrements, and went
off grieving that there were no outlaws any more, and wondering
what modern civilization could claim to have done to compensate for
their loss. They said they would rather be outlaws a year in
Sherwood Forest than President of the United States forever.
