Within two minutes, or even less, he had forgotten all his<br/>troubles. Not because his troubles were one whit less heavy and<br/>bitter to him than a man's are to a man, but because a new and<br/>powerful interest bore them down and drove them out of his mind for<br/>the time — just as men's misfortunes are forgotten in the<br/>excitement of new enterprises. This new interest was a valued<br/>novelty in whistling, which he had just acquired from a negro, and<br/>he was suffering to practise it undisturbed. It consisted in a<br/>peculiar bird-like turn, a sort of liquid warble, produced by<br/>touching the tongue to the roof of the mouth at short intervals in<br/>the midst of the music — the reader probably remembers how to do<br/>it, if he has ever been a boy. Diligence and attention soon gave<br/>him the knack of it, and he strode down the street with his mouth<br/>full of harmony and his soul full of gratitude. He felt much as an<br/>astronomer feels who has discovered a new planet — no doubt, as far<br/>as strong, deep, unalloyed pleasure is concerned, the advantage was<br/>with the boy, not the astronomer.<br/><br/>The summer evenings were long. It was not dark, yet. Presently<br/>Tom checked his whistle. A stranger was before him — a boy a shade<br/>larger than himself. A new-comer of any age or either sex was an<br/>impressive curiosity in the poor little shabby village of St.<br/>Petersburg. This boy was well dressed, too — well dressed on a<br/>week-day. This was simply astounding. His cap was a dainty thing,<br/>his closebuttoned blue cloth roundabout was new and natty, and so<br/>were his pantaloons. He had shoes on — and it was only Friday. He<br/>even wore a necktie, a bright bit of ribbon. He had a citified air<br/>about him that ate into Tom's vitals. The more Tom stared at the<br/>splendid marvel, the higher he turned up his nose at his finery and<br/>the shabbier and shabbier his own outfit seemed to him to grow.<br/>Neither boy spoke. If one moved, the other moved — but only<br/>sidewise, in a circle; they kept face to face and eye to eye all<br/>the time. Finally Tom said:<br/><br/>"I can lick you!"<br/><br/>"I'd like to see you try it."<br/><br/>"Well, I can do it."<br/><br/>"No you can't, either."<br/><br/>"Yes I can."<br/><br/>"No you can't."<br/><br/>"I can."<br/><br/>"You can't."<br/><br/>"Can!"<br/>
