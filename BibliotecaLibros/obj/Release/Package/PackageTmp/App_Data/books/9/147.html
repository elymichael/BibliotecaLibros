<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>25<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>There comes a time in every rightly-constructed boy's life when<br/>he has a raging desire to go somewhere and dig for hidden treasure.<br/>This desire suddenly came upon Tom one day. He sallied out to find<br/>Joe Harper, but failed of success. Next he sought Ben Rogers; he<br/>had gone fishing. Presently he stumbled upon Huck Finn the<br/>Red-Handed. Huck would answer. Tom took him to a private place and<br/>opened the matter to him confidentially. Huck was willing. Huck was<br/>always willing to take a hand in any enterprise that offered<br/>entertainment and required no capital, for he had a troublesome<br/>superabundance of that sort of time which is not money. "Where'll<br/>we dig?" said Huck. "Oh, most anywhere."<br/><br/>"Why, is it hid all around?"<br/><br/>"No, indeed it ain't. It's hid in mighty particular places, Huck<br/>— sometimes on islands, sometimes in rotten chests under the end of<br/>a limb of an old dead tree, just where the shadow falls at<br/>midnight; but mostly under the floor in ha'nted houses."<br/><br/>"Who hides it?"<br/><br/>"Why, robbers, of course — who'd you reckon? Sunday-school<br/>sup'rintendents?"<br/><br/>"I don't know. If 'twas mine I wouldn't hide it; I'd spend it<br/>and have a good time."<br/><br/>
