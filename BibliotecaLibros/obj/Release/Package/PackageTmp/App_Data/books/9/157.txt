"Yes, but, Huck, ghosts don't travel around only at night. They
won't hender us from digging there in the daytime."

"Well, that's so. But you know mighty well people don't go about
that ha'nted house in the day nor the night."

"Well, that's mostly because they don't like to go where a man's
been murdered, anyway — but nothing's ever been seen around that
house except in the night — just some blue lights slipping by the
windows — no regular ghosts."

"Well, where you see one of them blue lights flickering around,
Tom, you can bet there's a ghost mighty close behind it. It stands
to reason. Becuz you know that they don't anybody but ghosts use
'em."

"Yes, that's so. But anyway they don't come around in the
daytime, so what's the use of our being afeard?"

"Well, all right. We'll tackle the ha'nted house if you say so —
but I reckon it's taking chances."

They had started down the hill by this time. There in the middle
of the moonlit valley below them stood the "ha'nted" house, utterly
isolated, its fences gone long ago, rank weeds smothering the very
doorsteps, the chimney crumbled to ruin, the window-sashes vacant,
a corner of the roof caved in. The boys gazed awhile, half
expecting to see a blue light flit past a window; then talking in a
low tone, as befitted the time and the circumstances, they struck
far off to the right, to give the haunted house a wide berth, and
took their way homeward through the woods that adorned the rearward
side of Cardiff Hill.
