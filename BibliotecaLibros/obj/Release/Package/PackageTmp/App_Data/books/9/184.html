"Follered 'em — yes. That was it. I wanted to see what was up —<br/>they sneaked along so. I dogged 'em to the widder's stile, and<br/>stood in the dark and heard the ragged one beg for the widder, and<br/>the Spaniard swear he'd spile her looks just as I told you and your<br/>two —"<br/><br/>"What! The deaf and dumb man said all that!"<br/><br/>Huck had made another terrible mistake! He was trying his best<br/>to keep the old man from getting the faintest hint of who the<br/>Spaniard might be, and yet his tongue seemed determined to get him<br/>into trouble in spite of all he could do.
