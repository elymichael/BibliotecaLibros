"Yes."<br/><br/>"What'll you take for her?"<br/><br/>"What'll you give?"<br/><br/>"Piece of lickrish and a fish-hook."<br/><br/>"Less see 'em."<br/><br/>Tom exhibited. They were satisfactory, and the property changed<br/>hands. Then Tom traded a couple of white alleys for three red<br/>tickets, and some small trifle or other for a couple of blue ones.<br/>He waylaid other boys as they came, and went on buying tickets of<br/>various colors ten or fifteen minutes longer. He entered the<br/>church, now, with a swarm of clean and noisy boys and girls,<br/>proceeded to his seat and started a quarrel with the first boy that<br/>came handy. The teacher, a grave, elderly man, interfered; then<br/>turned his back a moment and Tom pulled a boy's hair in the next<br/>bench, and was absorbed in his book when the boy turned around;<br/>stuck a pin in another boy, presently, in order to hear him say<br/>"Ouch!" and got a new reprimand from his teacher. Tom's whole class<br/>were of a pattern — restless, noisy, and troublesome. When they<br/>came to recite their lessons, not one of them knew his verses<br/>perfectly, but had to be prompted all along. However, they worried<br/>through, and each got his reward — in small blue tickets, each with<br/>a passage of Scripture on it; each blue ticket was pay for two<br/>verses of the recitation. Ten blue tickets equalled a red one, and<br/>could be exchanged for it; ten red tickets equalled a yellow one;<br/>for ten yellow tickets the superintendent gave a very plainly bound<br/>Bible (worth forty cents in those easy times) to the pupil. How<br/>many of my readers would have the industry and application to<br/>memorize two thousand verses, even for a Dore Bible? And yet Mary<br/>had acquired two Bibles in this way — it was the patient work of<br/>two years — and a boy of German parentage had won four or five. He<br/>once recited three thousand verses without stopping; but the strain<br/>upon his mental faculties was too great, and he was little better<br/>than an idiot from that day forth — a grievous misfortune for the<br/>school, for on great occasions, before company, the superintendent<br/>(as Tom expressed it) had always made this boy come out and "spread<br/>himself." Only the older pupils managed to keep their tickets and<br/>stick to their tedious work long enough to get a Bible, and so the<br/>delivery of one of these prizes was a rare and noteworthy<br/>circumstance; the successful pupil was so great and conspicuous for<br/>that day that on the spot every scholar's heart was fired with a<br/>fresh ambition that often lasted a couple of weeks. It is possible<br/>that Tom's mental stomach had never really hungered for one of<br/>those prizes, but unquestionably his entire being had for many a<br/>day longed for the glory and the eclat that came with it.<br/><br/>In due course the superintendent stood up in front of the<br/>pulpit, with a closed hymn-book in his hand and his forefinger<br/>inserted between its leaves, and commanded attention. When a<br/>Sunday-school superintendent makes his customary little speech, a<br/>hymn-book in the hand is as necessary as is the inevitable sheet of<br/>music in the hand of a singer who stands forward on the platform<br/>and sings a solo at a concert — though why, is a mystery: for<br/>neither the hymn-book nor the sheet of music is ever referred to by<br/>the sufferer. This superintendent was a slim creature of<br/>thirty-five, with a sandy goatee and short sandy hair; he wore a<br/>stiff standing-collar whose upper edge almost reached his ears and<br/>whose sharp points curved forward abreast the corners of his mouth<br/>— a fence that compelled a straight lookout ahead, and a turning of<br/>the whole body when a side view was required; his chin was propped<br/>on a spreading cravat which was as broad and as long as a<br/>bank-note, and had fringed ends; his boot toes were turned sharply<br/>up, in the fashion of the day, like sleigh-runners — an effect<br/>patiently and laboriously produced by the young men by sitting with<br/>their toes pressed against a wall for hours together. Mr. Walters<br/>was very earnest of mien, and very sincere and honest at heart; and<br/>he held sacred things and places in such reverence, and so<br/>separated them from worldly matters, that unconsciously to himself<br/>his Sunday-school voice had acquired a peculiar intonation which<br/>was wholly absent on week-days. He began after this fashion:<br/><br/>"Now, children, I want you all to sit up just as straight and<br/>pretty as you can and give me all your attention for a minute or<br/>two. There — that is it. That is the way good little boys and girls<br/>should do. I see one little girl who is looking out of the window —<br/>I am afraid she thinks I am out there somewhere — perhaps up in one<br/>of the trees making a speech to the little birds. [Applausive<br/>titter.] I want to tell you how good it makes me feel to see so<br/>many bright, clean little faces assembled in a place like this,<br/>learning to do right and be good." And so forth and so on. It is<br/>not necessary to set down the rest of the oration. It was of a<br/>pattern which does not vary, and so it is familiar to us all.<br/><br/>The latter third of the speech was marred by the resumption of<br/>fights and other recreations among certain of the bad boys, and by<br/>fidgetings and whisperings that extended far and wide, washing even<br/>to the bases of isolated and incorruptible rocks like Sid and Mary.<br/>But now every sound ceased suddenly, with the subsidence of Mr.<br/>Walters' voice, and the conclusion of the speech was received with<br/>a burst of silent gratitude.<br/><br/>A good part of the whispering had been occasioned by an event<br/>which was more or less rare — the entrance of visitors: lawyer<br/>Thatcher, accompanied by a very feeble and aged man; a fine,<br/>portly, middle-aged gentleman with iron-gray hair; and a dignified<br/>lady who was doubtless the latter's wife. The lady was leading a<br/>child. Tom had been restless and full of chafings and repinings;<br/>conscience-smitten, too — he could not meet Amy Lawrence's eye, he<br/>could not brook her loving gaze. But when he saw this small<br/>new-comer his soul was all ablaze with bliss in a moment. The next<br/>moment he was "showing off" with all his might — cuffing boys,<br/>pulling hair, making faces — in a word, using every art that seemed<br/>likely to fascinate a girl and win her applause. His exaltation had<br/>but one alloy — the memory of his humiliation in this angel's<br/>garden — and that record in sand was fast washing out, under the<br/>waves of happiness that were sweeping over it now.<br/><br/>The visitors were given the highest seat of honor, and as soon<br/>as Mr. Walters' speech was finished, he introduced them to the<br/>school. The middle-aged man turned out to be a prodigious personage<br/>— no less a one than the county judge — altogether the most august<br/>creation these children had ever looked upon — and they wondered<br/>what kind of material he was made of — and they half wanted to hear<br/>him roar, and were half afraid he might, too. He was from<br/>Constantinople, twelve miles away — so he had travelled, and seen<br/>the world — these very eyes had looked upon the county court-house<br/>— which was said to have a tin roof. The awe which these<br/>reflections inspired was attested by the impressive silence and the<br/>ranks of staring eyes. This was the great Judge Thatcher, brother<br/>of their own lawyer. Jeff Thatcher immediately went forward, to be<br/>familiar with the great man and be envied by the school. It would<br/>have been music to his soul to hear the whisperings:<br/>
