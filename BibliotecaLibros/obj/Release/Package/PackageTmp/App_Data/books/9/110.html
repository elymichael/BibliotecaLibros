<br/>But at last the battle was done, and the forces retired with<br/>weaker and weaker threatenings and grumblings, and peace resumed<br/>her sway. The boys went back to camp, a good deal awed; but they<br/>found there was still something to be thankful for, because the<br/>great sycamore, the shelter of their beds, was a ruin, now, blasted<br/>by the lightnings, and they were not under it when the catastrophe<br/>happened.<br/><br/>Everything in camp was drenched, the camp-fire as well; for they<br/>were but heedless lads, like their generation, and had made no<br/>provision against rain. Here was matter for dismay, for they were<br/>soaked through and chilled. They were eloquent in their distress;<br/>but they presently discovered that the fire had eaten so far up<br/>under the great log it had been built against (where it curved<br/>upward and separated itself from the ground), that a handbreadth or<br/>so of it had escaped wetting; so they patiently wrought until, with<br/>shreds and bark gathered from the under sides of sheltered logs,<br/>they coaxed the fire to burn again. Then they piled on great dead<br/>boughs till they had a roaring furnace, and were glad-hearted once<br/>more. They dried their boiled ham and had a feast, and after that<br/>they sat by the fire and expanded and glorified their midnight<br/>adventure until morning, for there was not a dry spot to sleep on,<br/>anywhere around.<br/><br/>As the sun began to steal in upon the boys, drowsiness came over<br/>them, and they went out on the sandbar and lay down to sleep. They<br/>got scorched out by and by, and drearily set about getting<br/>breakfast. After the meal they felt rusty, and stiff-jointed, and a<br/>little homesick once more. Tom saw the signs, and fell to cheering<br/>up the pirates as well as he could. But they cared nothing for<br/>marbles, or circus, or swimming, or anything. He reminded them of<br/>the imposing secret, and raised a ray of cheer. While it lasted, he<br/>got them interested in a new device. This was to knock off being<br/>pirates, for a while, and be Indians for a change. They were<br/>attracted by this idea; so it was not long before they were<br/>stripped, and striped from head to heel with black mud, like so<br/>many zebras — all of them chiefs, of course — and then they went<br/>tearing through the woods to attack an English settlement.<br/><br/>By and by they separated into three hostile tribes, and darted<br/>upon each other from ambush with dreadful war-whoops, and killed<br/>and scalped each other by thousands. It was a gory day.<br/>Consequently it was an extremely satisfactory one.<br/><br/>They assembled in camp toward supper-time, hungry and happy; but<br/>now a difficulty arose — hostile Indians could not break the bread<br/>of hospitality together without first making peace, and this was a<br/>simple impossibility without smoking a pipe of peace. There was no<br/>other process that ever they had heard of. Two of the savages<br/>almost wished they had remained pirates. However, there was no<br/>other way; so with such show of cheerfulness as they could muster<br/>they called for the pipe and took their whiff as it passed, in due<br/>form.<br/><br/>And behold, they were glad they had gone into savagery, for they<br/>had gained something; they found that they could now smoke a little<br/>without having to go and hunt for a lost knife; they did not get<br/>sick enough to be seriously uncomfortable. They were not likely to<br/>fool away this high promise for lack of effort. No, they practised<br/>cautiously, after supper, with right fair success, and so they<br/>spent a jubilant evening. They were prouder and happier in their<br/>new acquirement than they would have been in the scalping and<br/>skinning of the Six Nations. We will leave them to smoke and<br/>chatter and brag, since we have no further use for them at<br/>present.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
