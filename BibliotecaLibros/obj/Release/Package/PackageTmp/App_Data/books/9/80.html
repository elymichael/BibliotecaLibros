<br/>After breakfast his aunt took him aside, and Tom almost<br/>brightened in the hope that he was going to be flogged; but it was<br/>not so. His aunt wept over him and asked him how he could go and<br/>break her old heart so; and finally told him to go on, and ruin<br/>himself and bring her gray hairs with sorrow to the grave, for it<br/>was no use for her to try any more. This was worse than a thousand<br/>whippings, and Tom's heart was sorer now than his body. He cried,<br/>he pleaded for forgiveness, promised to reform over and over again,<br/>and then received his dismissal, feeling that he had won but an<br/>imperfect forgiveness and established but a feeble confidence.<br/><br/>He left the presence too miserable to even feel revengeful<br/>toward Sid; and so the latter's prompt retreat through the back<br/>gate was unnecessary. He moped to school gloomy and sad, and took<br/>his flogging, along with Joe Harper, for playing hookey the day<br/>before, with the air of one whose heart was busy with heavier woes<br/>and wholly dead to trifles. Then he betook himself to his seat,<br/>rested his elbows on his desk and his jaws in his hands, and stared<br/>at the wall with the stony stare of suffering that has reached the<br/>limit and can no further go. His elbow was pressing against some<br/>hard substance. After a long time he slowly and sadly changed his<br/>position, and took up this object with a sigh. It was in a paper.<br/>He unrolled it. A long, lingering, colossal sigh followed, and his<br/>heart broke. It was his brass andiron knob!<br/><br/>This final feather broke the camel's back.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
