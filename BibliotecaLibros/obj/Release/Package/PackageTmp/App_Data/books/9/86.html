<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>12<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>One of the reasons why Tom's mind had drifted away from its<br/>secret troubles was, that it had found a new and weighty matter to<br/>interest itself about. Becky Thatcher had stopped coming to school.<br/>Tom had struggled with his pride a few days, and tried to "whistle<br/>her down the wind," but failed. He began to find himself hanging<br/>around her father's house, nights, and feeling very miserable. She<br/>was ill. What if she should die! There was distraction in the<br/>thought. He no longer took an interest in war, nor even in piracy.<br/>The charm of life was gone; there was nothing but dreariness left.<br/>He put his hoop away, and his bat; there was no joy in them any<br/>more. His aunt was concerned. She began to try all manner of<br/>remedies on him. She was one of those people who are infatuated<br/>with patent medicines and all new-fangled methods of producing<br/>health or mending it. She was an inveterate experimenter in these<br/>things. When something fresh in this line came out she was in a<br/>fever, right away, to try it; not on herself, for she was never<br/>ailing, but on anybody else that came handy. She was a subscriber<br/>for all the "Health" periodicals and phrenological frauds; and the<br/>solemn ignorance they were inflated with was breath to her<br/>nostrils. All the "rot" they contained about ventilation, and how<br/>to go to bed, and how to get up, and what to eat, and what to<br/>drink, and how much exercise to take, and what frame of mind to<br/>keep one's self in, and what sort of clothing to wear, was all<br/>gospel to her, and she never observed that her health-journals of<br/>the current month customarily upset everything they had recommended<br/>the month before. She was as simple-hearted and honest as the day<br/>was long, and so she was an easy victim. She gathered together her<br/>quack periodicals and her quack medicines, and thus armed with<br/>death, went about on her pale horse, metaphorically speaking, with<br/>"hell following after." But she never suspected that she was not an<br/>angel of healing and the balm of Gilead in disguise, to the<br/>suffering neighbors. The water treatment was new, now, and Tom's<br/>low condition was a windfall to her. She had him out at daylight<br/>every morning, stood him up in the woodshed and drowned him with a<br/>deluge of cold water; then she scrubbed him down with a towel like<br/>a file, and so brought him to; then she rolled him up in a wet<br/>sheet and put him away under blankets till she sweated his soul<br/>clean and "the yellow stains of it came through his pores" â€” as Tom<br/>said.<br/><br/>Yet notwithstanding all this, the boy grew more and more<br/>melancholy and pale and dejected. She added hot baths, sitz baths,<br/>shower baths, and plunges. The boy remained as dismal as a hearse.<br/>She began to assist the water with a slim oatmeal diet and<br/>blister-plasters. She calculated his capacity as she would a jug's,<br/>and filled him up every day with quack cure-alls.<br/><br/>Tom had become indifferent to persecution by this time. This<br/>phase filled the old lady's heart with consternation. This<br/>indifference must be broken up at any cost. Now she heard of<br/>Pain-killer for the first time. She ordered a lot at once. She<br/>tasted it and was filled with gratitude. It was simply fire in a<br/>liquid form. She dropped the water treatment and everything else,<br/>and pinned her faith to Pain-killer. She gave Tom a teaspoonful and<br/>watched with the deepest anxiety for the result. Her troubles were<br/>instantly at rest, her soul at peace again; for the "indifference"<br/>was broken up. The boy could not have shown a wilder, heartier<br/>interest, if she had built a fire under him.<br/><br/>Tom felt that it was time to wake up; this sort of life might be<br/>romantic enough, in his blighted condition, but it was getting to<br/>have too little sentiment and too much distracting variety about<br/>it. So he thought over various plans for relief, and finally hit<br/>pon that of professing to be fond of Pain-killer. He asked for it<br/>so often that he became a nuisance, and his aunt ended by telling<br/>him to help himself and quit bothering her. If it had been Sid, she<br/>would have had no misgivings to alloy her delight; but since it was<br/>Tom, she watched the bottle clandestinely. She found that the<br/>medicine did really diminish, but it did not occur to her that the<br/>boy was mending the health of a crack in the sitting-room floor<br/>with it.<br/><br/>One day Tom was in the act of dosing the crack when his aunt's<br/>yellow cat came along, purring, eying the teaspoon avariciously,<br/>and begging for a taste. Tom said:<br/><br/>"Don't ask for it unless you want it, Peter."<br/><br/>
