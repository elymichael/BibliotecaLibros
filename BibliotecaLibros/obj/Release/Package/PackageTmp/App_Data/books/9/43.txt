"Yes. Least I reckon so."

"Did he say anything?"

"I don't reckon he did. I don't know."

"Aha! Talk about trying to cure warts with spunk-water such a
blame fool way as that! Why, that ain't a-going to do any good. You
got to go all by yourself, to the middle of the woods, where you
know there's a spunk-water stump, and just as it's midnight you
back up against the stump and jam your hand in and say:

'Barley-corn, barley-corn, injun-meal shorts,

Spunk-water, spunk-water, swaller these warts,'

and then walk away quick, eleven steps, with your eyes shut, and
then turn around three times and walk home without speaking to
anybody. Because if you speak the charm's busted." "Well, that
sounds like a good way; but that ain't the way Bob Tanner
done."

"No, sir, you can bet he didn't, becuz he's the wartiest boy in
this town; and he wouldn't have a wart on him if he'd knowed how to
work spunk-water. I've took off thousands of warts off of my hands
that way, Huck. I play with frogs so much that I've always got
considerable many warts. Sometimes I take 'em off with a bean."

"Yes, bean's good. I've done that."

"Have you? What's your way?"

"You take and split the bean, and cut the wart so as to get some
blood, and then you put the blood on one piece of the bean and take
and dig a hole and bury it 'bout midnight at the crossroads in the
dark of the moon, and then you burn up the rest of the bean. You
see that piece that's got the blood on it will keep drawing and
drawing, trying to fetch the other piece to it, and so that helps
the blood to draw the wart, and pretty soon off she comes."
