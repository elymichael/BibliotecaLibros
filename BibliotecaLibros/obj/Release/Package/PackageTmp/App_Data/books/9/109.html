"So do I! And when we tell 'em we learned when we was off<br/>pirating, won't they wish they'd been along?"<br/><br/>"Oh, I reckon not! I'll just bet they will!"<br/><br/>So the talk ran on. But presently it began to flag a trifle, and<br/>grow disjointed. The silences widened; the expectoration<br/>marvellously increased. Every pore inside the boys' cheeks became a<br/>spouting fountain; they could scarcely bail out the cellars under<br/>their tongues fast enough to prevent an inundation; little<br/>overflowings down their throats occurred in spite of all they could<br/>do, and sudden retchings followed every time. Both boys were<br/>looking very pale and miserable, now. Joe's pipe dropped from his<br/>nerveless fingers. Tom's followed. Both fountains were going<br/>furiously and both pumps bailing with might and main. Joe said<br/>feebly:<br/><br/>"I've lost my knife. I reckon I better go and find it."<br/><br/>Tom said, with quivering lips and halting utterance:<br/><br/>"I'll help you. You go over that way and I'll hunt around by the<br/>spring. No, you needn't come, Huck — we can find it."<br/><br/>So Huck sat down again, and waited an hour. Then he found it<br/>lonesome, and went to find his comrades. They were wide apart in<br/>the woods, both very pale, both fast asleep. But something informed<br/>him that if they had had any trouble they had got rid of it.<br/><br/>They were not talkative at supper that night. They had a humble<br/>look, and when Huck prepared his pipe after the meal and was going<br/>to prepare theirs, they said no, they were not feeling very well —<br/>something they ate at dinner had disagreed with them.<br/><br/>About midnight Joe awoke, and called the boys. There was a<br/>brooding oppressiveness in the air that seemed to bode something.<br/>The boys huddled themselves together and sought the friendly<br/>companionship of the fire, though the dull dead heat of the<br/>breathless atmosphere was stifling. They sat still, intent and<br/>waiting. The solemn hush continued. Beyond the light of the fire<br/>everything was swallowed up in the blackness of darkness. Presently<br/>there came a quivering glow that vaguely revealed the foliage for a<br/>moment and then vanished. By and by another came, a little<br/>stronger. Then another. Then a faint moan came sighing through the<br/>branches of the forest and the boys felt a fleeting breath upon<br/>their cheeks, and shuddered with the fancy that the Spirit of the<br/>Night had gone by. There was a pause. Now a weird flash turned<br/>night into day and showed every little grass-blade, separate and<br/>distinct, that grew about their feet. And it showed three white,<br/>startled faces, too. A deep peal of thunder went rolling and<br/>tumbling down the heavens and lost itself in sullen rumblings in<br/>the distance. A sweep of chilly air passed by, rustling all the<br/>leaves and snowing the flaky ashes broadcast about the fire.<br/>Another fierce glare lit up the forest and an instant crash<br/>followed that seemed to rend the tree-tops right over the boys'<br/>heads. They clung together in terror, in the thick gloom that<br/>followed. A few big rain-drops fell pattering upon the leaves.<br/><br/>"Quick! boys, go for the tent!" exclaimed Tom.<br/><br/>They sprang away, stumbling over roots and among vines in the<br/>dark, no two plunging in the same direction. A furious blast roared<br/>through the trees, making everything sing as it went. One blinding<br/>flash after another came, and peal on peal of deafening thunder.<br/>And now a drenching rain poured down and the rising hurricane drove<br/>it in sheets along the ground. The boys cried out to each other,<br/>but the roaring wind and the booming thunder-blasts drowned their<br/>voices utterly. However, one by one they straggled in at last and<br/>took shelter under the tent, cold, scared, and streaming with<br/>water; but to have company in misery seemed something to be<br/>grateful for. They could not talk, the old sail flapped so<br/>furiously, even if the other noises would have allowed them. The<br/>tempest rose higher and higher, and presently the sail tore loose<br/>from its fastenings and went winging away on the blast. The boys<br/>seized each others' hands and fled, with many tumblings and<br/>bruises, to the shelter of a great oak that stood upon the<br/>river-bank. Now the battle was at its highest. Under the ceaseless<br/>conflagration of lightning that flamed in the skies, everything<br/>below stood out in clean-cut and shadowless distinctness: the<br/>bending trees, the billowy river, white with foam, the driving<br/>spray of spume-flakes, the dim outlines of the high bluffs on the<br/>other side, glimpsed through the drifting cloud-rack and the<br/>slanting veil of rain. Every little while some giant tree yielded<br/>the fight and fell crashing through the younger growth; and the<br/>unflagging thunder-peals came now in ear-splitting explosive<br/>bursts, keen and sharp, and unspeakably appalling. The storm<br/>culminated in one matchless effort that seemed likely to tear the<br/>island to pieces, burn it up, drown it to the tree-tops, blow it<br/>away, and deafen every creature in it, all at one and the same<br/>moment. It was a wild night for homeless young heads to be out<br/>in.<br/>
