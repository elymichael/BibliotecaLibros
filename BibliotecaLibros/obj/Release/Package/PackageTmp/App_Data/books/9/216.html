<br/>"Now, Tom, hain't you always ben friendly to me? You wouldn't<br/>shet me out, would you, Tom? You wouldn't do that, now, would you,<br/>Tom?"<br/><br/>"Huck, I wouldn't want to, and I don't want to — but what would<br/>people say? Why, they'd say, 'Mph! Tom Sawyer's Gang! pretty low<br/>characters in it!' They'd mean you, Huck. You wouldn't like that,<br/>and I wouldn't."<br/><br/>Huck was silent for some time, engaged in a mental struggle.<br/>Finally he said:<br/><br/>"Well, I'll go back to the widder for a month and tackle it and<br/>see if I can come to stand it, if you'll let me b'long to the gang,<br/>Tom."<br/><br/>"All right, Huck, it's a whiz! Come along, old chap, and I'll<br/>ask the widow to let up on you a little, Huck."<br/><br/>"Will you, Tom — now will you? That's good. If she'll let up on<br/>some of the roughest things, I'll smoke private and cuss private,<br/>and crowd through or bust. When you going to start the gang and<br/>turn robbers?"<br/><br/>"Oh, right off. We'll get the boys together and have the<br/>initiation to-night, maybe."<br/><br/>"Have the which?"<br/><br/>"Have the initiation."<br/><br/>"What's that?"<br/><br/>
