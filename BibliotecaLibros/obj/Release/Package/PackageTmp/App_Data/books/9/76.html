We'd drop down dead — don't you know that?"<br/><br/>"Yes, I reckon that's so."<br/><br/>They continued to whisper for some little time. Presently a dog<br/>set up a long, lugubrious howl just outside — within ten feet of<br/>them. The boys clasped each other suddenly, in an agony of<br/>fright.<br/><br/>"Which of us does he mean?" gasped Huckleberry.<br/><br/>"I dono — peep through the crack. Quick!"<br/><br/>"No, you, Tom!"<br/><br/>"I can't — I can't do it, Huck!"<br/><br/>"Please, Tom. There 'tis again!"<br/><br/>"Oh, lordy, I'm thankful!" whispered Tom. "I know his voice.<br/>It's Bull Harbison." *<br/><br/>
