"Oh, it ain't the bread, so much," said Tom; "I reckon it's
mostly what they say over it before they start it out."

"But they don't say anything over it," said Huck. "I've seen 'em
and they don't."

"Well, that's funny," said Tom. "But maybe they say it to
themselves. Of course they do. Anybody might know that."

The other boys agreed that there was reason in what Tom said,
because an ignorant lump of bread, uninstructed by an incantation,
could not be expected to act very intelligently when set upon an
errand of such gravity.

"By jings, I wish I was over there, now," said Joe.

"I do too" said Huck "I'd give heaps to know who it is."

The boys still listened and watched. Presently a revealing
thought flashed through Tom's mind, and he exclaimed:

"Boys, I know who's drownded — it's us!"

They felt like heroes in an instant. Here was a gorgeous
triumph; they were missed; they were mourned; hearts were breaking

supper and ate it, and then fell to guessing at what the village
was thinking and saying about them; and the pictures they drew of
the public distress on their account were gratifying to look upon —
from their point of view. But when the shadows of night closed them
in, they gradually ceased to talk, and sat gazing into the fire,
with their minds evidently wandering elsewhere. The excitement was
gone, now, and Tom and Joe could not keep back thoughts of certain
persons at home who were not enjoying this fine frolic as much as
they were. Misgivings came; they grew troubled and unhappy; a sigh
or two escaped, unawares. By and by Joe timidly ventured upon a
roundabout "feeler" as to how the others might look upon a return
to civilization — not right now, but —
