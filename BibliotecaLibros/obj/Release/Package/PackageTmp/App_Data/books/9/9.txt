"Powerful warm, warn't it?"

"Yes'm."

"Didn't you want to go in a-swimming, Tom?"

A bit of a scare shot through Tom — a touch of uncomfortable
suspicion. He searched Aunt Polly's face, but it told him nothing.
So he said:

"No'm — well, not very much."

The old lady reached out her hand and felt Tom's shirt, and
said:

"But you ain't too warm now, though." And it flattered her to
reflect that she had discovered that the shirt was dry without
anybody knowing that that was what she had in her mind. But in
spite of her, Tom knew where the wind lay, now. So he forestalled
what might be the next move:

"Some of us pumped on our heads — mine's damp yet. See?"

Aunt Polly was vexed to think she had overlooked that bit of
circumstantial evidence, and missed a trick. Then she had a new
inspiration:

"Tom, you didn't have to undo your shirt collar where I sewed
it, to pump on your head, did you? Unbutton your jacket!"

The trouble vanished out of Tom's face. He opened his jacket.
His shirt collar was securely sewed.
