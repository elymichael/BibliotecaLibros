<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>18<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>That was Tom's great secret — the scheme to return home with his<br/>brother pirates and attend their own funerals. They had paddled<br/>over to the Missouri shore on a log, at dusk on Saturday, landing<br/>five or six miles below the village; they had slept in the woods at<br/>the edge of the town till nearly daylight, and had then crept<br/>through back lanes and alleys and finished their sleep in the<br/>gallery of the church among a chaos of invalided benches.<br/><br/>At breakfast, Monday morning, Aunt Polly and Mary were very<br/>loving to Tom, and very attentive to his wants. There was an<br/>unusual amount of talk. In the course of it Aunt Polly said:<br/><br/>"Well, I don't say it wasn't a fine joke, Tom, to keep everybody<br/>suffering 'most a week so you boys had a good time, but it is a<br/>pity you could be so hard-hearted as to let me suffer so. If you<br/>could come over on a log to go to your funeral, you could have come<br/>over and give me a hint some way that you warn't dead, but only run<br/>off."<br/><br/>"Yes, you could have done that, Tom," said Mary; "and I believe<br/>you would if you had thought of it."<br/><br/>"Would you, Tom?" said Aunt Polly, her face lighting wistfully.<br/>"Say, now, would you, if you'd thought of it?"<br/><br/>"I — well, I don't know. 'Twould 'a' spoiled everything."<br/><br/>
