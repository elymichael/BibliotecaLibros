<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>27<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>The adventure of the day mightily tormented Tom's dreams that<br/>night. Four times he had his hands on that rich treasure and four<br/>times it wasted to nothingness in his fingers as sleep forsook him<br/>and wakefulness brought back the hard reality of his misfortune. As<br/>he lay in the early morning recalling the incidents of his great<br/>adventure, he noticed that they seemed curiously subdued and far<br/>away — somewhat as if they had happened in another world, or in a<br/>time long gone by. Then it occurred to him that the great adventure<br/>itself must be a dream! There was one very strong argument in favor<br/>of this idea — namely, that the quantity of coin he had seen was<br/>too vast to be real. He had never seen as much as fifty dollars in<br/>one mass before, and he was like all boys of his age and station in<br/>life, in that he imagined that all references to "hundreds" and<br/>"thousands" were mere fanciful forms of speech, and that no such<br/>sums really existed in the world. He never had supposed for a<br/>moment that so large a sum as a hundred dollars was to be found in<br/>actual money in any one's possession. If his notions of hidden<br/>treasure had been analyzed, they would have been found to consist<br/>of a handful of real dimes and a bushel of vague, splendid,<br/>ungraspable dollars.<br/><br/>But the incidents of his adventure grew sensibly sharper and<br/>clearer under the attrition of thinking them over, and so he<br/>presently found himself leaning to the impression that the thing<br/>might not have been a dream, after all. This uncertainty must be<br/>swept away. He would snatch a hurried breakfast and go and find<br/>Huck. Huck was sitting on the gunwale of a flatboat, listlessly<br/>dangling his feet in the water and looking very melancholy. Tom<br/>concluded to let Huck lead up to the subject. If he did not do it,<br/>then the adventure would be proved to have been only a dream.<br/><br/>"Hello, Huck!"<br/><br/>"Hello, yourself."<br/><br/>Silence, for a minute.<br/><br/>"Tom, if we'd 'a' left the blame tools at the dead tree, we'd<br/>'a' got the money. Oh, ain't it awful!"<br/><br/>
