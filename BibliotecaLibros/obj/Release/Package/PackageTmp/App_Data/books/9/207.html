<br/>They presently emerged into the clump of sumach bushes, looked<br/>warily out, found the coast clear, and were soon lunching and<br/>smoking in the skiff. As the sun dipped toward the horizon they<br/>pushed out and got under way. Tom skimmed up the shore through the<br/>long twilight, chatting cheerily with Huck, and landed shortly<br/>after dark.<br/><br/>"Now, Huck," said Tom, "we'll hide the money in the loft of the<br/>widow's woodshed, and I'll come up in the morning and we'll count<br/>it and divide, and then we'll hunt up a place out in the woods for<br/>it where it will be safe. Just you lay quiet here and watch the<br/>stuff till I run and hook Benny Taylor's little wagon; I won't be<br/>gone a minute."<br/><br/>He disappeared, and presently returned with the wagon, put the<br/>two small sacks into it, threw some old rags on top of them, and<br/>started off, dragging his cargo behind him. When the boys reached<br/>the Welshman's house, they stopped to rest. Just as they were about<br/>to move on, the Welshman stepped out and said:<br/><br/>"Hallo, who's that?"<br/><br/>"Huck and Tom Sawyer."<br/><br/>"Good! Come along with me, boys, you are keeping everybody<br/>waiting. Here — hurry up, trot ahead — I'll haul the wagon for you.<br/>Why, it's not as light as it might be. Got bricks in it? — or old<br/>metal?"<br/><br/>"Old metal," said Tom.<br/><br/>"I judged so; the boys in this town will take more trouble and<br/>fool away more time hunting up six bits' worth of old iron to sell<br/>to the foundry than they would to make twice the money at regular<br/>work. But that's human nature — hurry along, hurry along!"<br/><br/>The boys wanted to know what the hurry was about.<br/><br/>"Never mind; you'll see, when we get to the Widow Douglas'."<br/><br/>
