<br/>"I reckon I ain't dressed fitten for a pirate," said he, with a<br/>regretful pathos in his voice; "but I ain't got none but<br/>these."<br/><br/>But the other boys told him the fine clothes would come fast<br/>enough, after they should have begun their adventures. They made<br/>him understand that his poor rags would do to begin with, though it<br/>was customary for wealthy pirates to start with a proper<br/>wardrobe.<br/><br/>Gradually their talk died out and drowsiness began to steal upon<br/>the eyelids of the little waifs. The pipe dropped from the fingers<br/>of the Red-Handed, and he slept the sleep of the conscience-free<br/>and the weary. The Terror of the Seas and the Black Avenger of the<br/>Spanish Main had more difficulty in getting to sleep. They said<br/>their prayers inwardly, and lying down, since there was nobody<br/>there with authority to make them kneel and recite aloud; in truth,<br/>they had a mind not to say them at all, but they were afraid to<br/>proceed to such lengths as that, lest they might call down a sudden<br/>and special thunderbolt from heaven. Then at once they reached and<br/>hovered upon the imminent verge of sleep — but an intruder came,<br/>now, that would not "down." It was conscience. They began to feel a<br/>vague fear that they had been doing wrong to run away; and next<br/>they thought of the stolen meat, and then the real torture came.<br/>They tried to argue it away by reminding conscience that they had<br/>purloined sweetmeats and apples scores of times; but conscience was<br/>not to be appeased by such thin plausibilities; it seemed to them,<br/>in the end, that there was no getting around the stubborn fact that<br/>taking sweetmeats was only "hooking," while taking bacon and hams<br/>and such valuables was plain simple stealing — and there was a<br/>command against that in the Bible. So they inwardly resolved that<br/>so long as they remained in the business, their piracies should not<br/>again be sullied with the crime of stealing. Then conscience<br/>granted a truce, and these curiously inconsistent pirates fell<br/>peacefully to sleep.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
