"You do?"

"Yes'm."

The old lady was bending down, Tom watching, with interest
emphasized by anxiety. Too late he divined her "drift." The handle
of the telltale teaspoon was visible under the bed-valance. Aunt
Polly took it, held it up. Tom winced, and dropped his eyes. Aunt
Polly raised him by the usual handle — his ear — and cracked his
head soundly with her thimble.

"Now, sir, what did you want to treat that poor dumb beast so,
for?"

"I done it out of pity for him — because he hadn't any
aunt."

"Hadn't any aunt! — you numskull. What has that got to do with
it?"

"Heaps. Because if he'd had one she'd a burnt him out herself!
She'd a roasted his bowels out of him 'thout any more feeling than
if he was a human!"

Aunt Polly felt a sudden pang of remorse. This was putting the
thing in a new light; what was cruelty to a cat might be cruelty to
a boy, too. She began to soften; she felt sorry. Her eyes watered a
little, and she put her hand on Tom's head and said gently:

"I was meaning for the best, Tom. And, Tom, it did do you
good."

Tom looked up in her face with just a perceptible twinkle
peeping through his gravity.
