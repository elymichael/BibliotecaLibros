A phrenologist and a mesmerizer came — and went again and left
the village duller and drearier than ever.

There were some boys-and-girls' parties, but they were so few
and so delightful that they only made the aching voids between ache
the harder.

Becky Thatcher was gone to her Constantinople home to stay with
her parents during vacation — so there was no bright side to life
anywhere.

The dreadful secret of the murder was a chronic misery. It was a
very cancer for permanency and pain.

Then came the measles.

During two long weeks Tom lay a prisoner, dead to the world and
its happenings. He was very ill, he was interested in nothing. When
he got upon his feet at last and moved feebly down-town, a
melancholy change had come over everything and every creature.
There had been a "revival," and everybody had "got religion," not
only the adults, but even the boys and girls. Tom went about,
hoping against hope for the sight of one blessed sinful face, but
disappointment crossed him everywhere. He found Joe Harper studying
a Testament, and turned sadly away from the depressing spectacle.
He sought Ben Rogers, and found him visiting the poor with a basket
of tracts. He hunted up Jim Hollis, who called his attention to the
precious blessing of his late measles as a warning. Every boy he
encountered added another ton to his depression; and when, in
desperation, he flew for refuge at last to the bosom of Huckleberry
Finn and was received with a Scriptural quotation, his heart broke
and he crept home and to bed realizing that he alone of all the
town was lost, forever and forever.

And that night there came on a terrific storm, with driving
rain, awful claps of thunder and blinding sheets of lightning. He
covered his head with the bedclothes and waited in a horror of
suspense for his doom; for he had not the shadow of a doubt that
all this hubbub was about him. He believed he had taxed the
forbearance of the powers above to the extremity of endurance and
that this was the result. It might have seemed to him a waste of
pomp and ammunition to kill a bug with a battery of artillery, but
there seemed nothing incongruous about the getting up such an
expensive thunderstorm as this to knock the turf from under an
insect like himself.

By and by the tempest spent itself and died without
accomplishing its object. The boy's first impulse was to be
grateful, and reform. His second was to wait — for there might not
be any more storms.

The next day the doctors were back; Tom had relapsed. The three
weeks he spent on his back this time seemed an entire age. When he
got abroad at last he was hardly grateful that he had been spared,
remembering how lonely was his estate, how companionless and
forlorn he was. He drifted listlessly down the street and found Jim
Hollis acting as judge in a juvenile court that was trying a cat
for murder, in the presence of her victim, a bird. He found Joe
Harper and Huck Finn up an alley eating a stolen melon. Poor lads!
they — like Tom — had suffered a relapse.
