But it roused only faint enthusiasm, which faded out, with no
reply. Tom tried one or two other seductions; but they failed, too.
It was discouraging work. Joe sat poking up the sand with a stick
and looking very gloomy. Finally he said:

"Oh, boys, let's give it up. I want to go home. It's so
lonesome."

"Oh no, Joe, you'll feel better by and by," said Tom. "Just
think of the fishing that's here."

"I don't care for fishing. I want to go home."

"But, Joe, there ain't such another swimming-place
anywhere."

"Swimming's no good. I don't seem to care for it, somehow, when
there ain't anybody to say I sha'n't go in. I mean to go home."

"Oh, shucks! Baby! You want to see your mother, I reckon."

"Yes, I do want to see my mother — and you would, too, if you
had one. I ain't any more baby than you are." And Joe snuffled a
little.

"Well, we'll let the cry-baby go home to his mother, won't we,
Huck? Poor thing — does it want to see its mother? And so it shall.
You like it here, don't you, Huck? We'll stay, won't we?"

Huck said, "Y-e-s" — without any heart in it.

"I'll never speak to you again as long as I live," said Joe,
rising. "There now!" And he moved moodily away and began to dress
himself.
