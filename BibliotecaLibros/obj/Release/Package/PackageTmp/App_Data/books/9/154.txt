"I reckon that'll be a good one. But won't the widow take it
away from us, Tom? It's on her land."

"She take it away! Maybe she'd like to try it once. Whoever
finds one of these hid treasures, it belongs to him. It don't make
any difference whose land it's on."

That was satisfactory. The work went on. By and by Huck
said:

"Blame it, we must be in the wrong place again. What do you
think?"

"It is mighty curious, Huck. I don't understand it. Sometimes
witches interfere. I reckon maybe that's what's the trouble
now."

"Shucks! Witches ain't got no power in the daytime."

"Well, that's so. I didn't think of that. Oh, I know what the
matter is! What a blamed lot of fools we are! You got to find out
where the shadow of the limb falls at midnight, and that's where
you dig!"

"Then consound it, we've fooled away all this work for nothing.
Now hang it all, we got to come back in the night. It's an awful
long way. Can you get out?"

"I bet I will. We've got to do it to-night, too, because if
somebody sees these holes they'll know in a minute what's here and
they'll go for it."

"Well, I'll come around and maow to-night."

"All right. Let's hide the tools in the bushes."
