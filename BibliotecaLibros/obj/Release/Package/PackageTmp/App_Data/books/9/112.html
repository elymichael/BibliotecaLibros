Then there was a dispute about who saw the dead boys last in<br/>life, and many claimed that dismal distinction, and offered<br/>evidences, more or less tampered with by the witness; and when it<br/>was ultimately decided who did see the departed last, and exchanged<br/>the last words with them, the lucky parties took upon themselves a<br/>sort of sacred importance, and were gaped at and envied by all the<br/>rest. One poor chap, who had no other grandeur to offer, said with<br/>tolerably manifest pride in the remembrance:<br/><br/>"Well, Tom Sawyer he licked me once."<br/><br/>But that bid for glory was a failure. Most of the boys could say<br/>that, and so that cheapened the distinction too much. The group<br/>loitered away, still recalling memories of the lost heroes, in awed<br/>voices.<br/><br/>When the Sunday-school hour was finished, the next morning, the<br/>bell began to toll, instead of ringing in the usual way. It was a<br/>very still Sabbath, and the mournful sound seemed in keeping with<br/>the musing hush that lay upon nature. The villagers began to<br/>gather, loitering a moment in the vestibule to converse in whispers<br/>about the sad event. But there was no whispering in the house; only<br/>the funereal rustling of dresses as the women gathered to their<br/>seats disturbed the silence there. None could remember when the<br/>little church had been so full before. There was finally a waiting<br/>pause, an expectant dumbness, and then Aunt Polly entered, followed<br/>by Sid and Mary, and they by the Harper family, all in deep black,<br/>and the whole congregation, the old minister as well, rose<br/>reverently and stood until the mourners were seated in the front<br/>pew. There was another communing silence, broken at intervals by<br/>muffled sobs, and then the minister spread his hands abroad and<br/>prayed. A moving hymn was sung, and the text followed: "I am the<br/>Resurrection and the Life."<br/><br/>As the service proceeded, the clergyman drew such pictures of<br/>the graces, the winning ways, and the rare promise of the lost lads<br/>that every soul there, thinking he recognized these pictures, felt<br/>a pang in remembering that he had persistently blinded himself to<br/>them always before, and had as persistently seen only faults and<br/>flaws in the poor boys. The minister related many a touching<br/>incident in the lives of the departed, too, which illustrated their<br/>sweet, generous natures, and the people could easily see, now, how<br/>noble and beautiful those episodes were, and remembered with grief<br/>that at the time they occurred they had seemed rank rascalities,<br/>well deserving of the cowhide. The congregation became more and<br/>more moved, as the pathetic tale went on, till at last the whole<br/>company broke down and joined the weeping mourners in a chorus of<br/>anguished sobs, the preacher himself giving way to his feelings,<br/>and crying in the pulpit.<br/><br/>There was a rustle in the gallery, which nobody noticed; a<br/>moment later the church door creaked; the minister raised his<br/>streaming eyes above his handkerchief, and stood transfixed! First<br/>one and then another pair of eyes followed the minister's, and then<br/>almost with one impulse the congregation rose and stared while the<br/>three dead boys came marching up the aisle, Tom in the lead, Joe<br/>next, and Huck, a ruin of drooping rags, sneaking sheepishly in the<br/>rear! They had been hid in the unused gallery listening to their<br/>own funeral sermon!<br/><br/>Aunt Polly, Mary, and the Harpers threw themselves upon their<br/>restored ones, smothered them with kisses and poured out<br/>thanksgivings, while poor Huck stood abashed and uncomfortable, not<br/>knowing exactly what to do or where to hide from so many<br/>unwelcoming eyes. He wavered, and started to slink away, but Tom<br/>seized him and said:<br/><br/>"Aunt Polly, it ain't fair. Somebody's got to be glad to see<br/>Huck."<br/><br/>"And so they shall. I'm glad to see him, poor motherless thing!"<br/>And the loving attentions Aunt Polly lavished upon him were the one<br/>thing capable of making him more uncomfortable than he was<br/>before.<br/><br/>Suddenly the minister shouted at the top of his voice: "Praise<br/>God from whom all blessings flow — Sing! — and put your hearts in<br/>it!"<br/><br/>And they did. Old Hundred swelled up with a triumphant burst,<br/>and while it shook the rafters Tom Sawyer the Pirate looked around<br/>upon the envying juveniles about him and confessed in his heart<br/>that this was the proudest moment of his life.<br/>
