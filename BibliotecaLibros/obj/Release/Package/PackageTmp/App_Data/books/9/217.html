"It's to swear to stand by one another, and never tell the<br/>gang's secrets, even if you're chopped all to flinders, and kill<br/>anybody and all his family that hurts one of the gang."<br/><br/>"That's gay — that's mighty gay, Tom, I tell you."<br/><br/>"Well, I bet it is. And all that swearing's got to be done at<br/>midnight, in the lonesomest, awfulest place you can find — a<br/>ha'nted house is the best, but they're all ripped up now."<br/><br/>"Well, midnight's good, anyway, Tom."<br/><br/>"Yes, so it is. And you've got to swear on a coffin, and sign it<br/>with blood."<br/><br/>"Now, that's something like! Why, it's a million times bullier<br/>than pirating. I'll stick to the widder till I rot, Tom; and if I<br/>git to be a reg'lar ripper of a robber, and everybody talking 'bout<br/>it, I reckon she'll be proud she snaked me in out of the wet."<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
