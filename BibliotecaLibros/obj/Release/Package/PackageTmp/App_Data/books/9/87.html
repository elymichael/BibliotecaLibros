But Peter signified that he did want it.<br/><br/>"You better make sure."<br/><br/>Peter was sure.<br/><br/>"Now you've asked for it, and I'll give it to you, because there<br/>ain't anything mean about me; but if you find you don't like it,<br/>you mustn't blame anybody but your own self."<br/><br/>Peter was agreeable. So Tom pried his mouth open and poured down<br/>the Pain-killer. Peter sprang a couple of yards in the air, and<br/>then delivered a war-whoop and set off round and round the room,<br/>banging against furniture, upsetting flower-pots, and making<br/>general havoc. Next he rose on his hind feet and pranced around, in<br/>a frenzy of enjoyment, with his head over his shoulder and his<br/>voice proclaiming his unappeasable happiness. Then he went tearing<br/>around the house again spreading chaos and destruction in his path.<br/>Aunt Polly entered in time to see him throw a few double<br/>summersets, deliver a final mighty hurrah, and sail through the<br/>open window, carrying the rest of the flower-pots with him. The old<br/>lady stood petrified with astonishment, peering over her glasses;<br/>Tom lay on the floor expiring with laughter.<br/><br/>"Tom, what on earth ails that cat?"<br/><br/>"I don't know, aunt," gasped the boy.<br/><br/>"Why, I never see anything like it. What did make him act<br/>so?"<br/><br/>"Deed I don't know, Aunt Polly; cats always act so when they're<br/>having a good time."<br/><br/>"They do, do they?" There was something in the tone that made<br/>Tom apprehensive.<br/><br/>"Yes'm. That is, I believe they do."<br/>
