<br/>"Guy of Guisborne wants no man's pass. Who art thou that — that<br/>—"<br/><br/>"Dares to hold such language," said Tom, prompting — for they<br/>talked "by the book," from memory.<br/><br/>"Who art thou that dares to hold such language?"<br/><br/>"I, indeed! I am Robin Hood, as thy caitiff carcase soon shall<br/>know."<br/><br/>"Then art thou indeed that famous outlaw? Right gladly will I<br/>dispute with thee the passes of the merry wood. Have at thee!"<br/><br/>They took their lath swords, dumped their other traps on the<br/>ground, struck a fencing attitude, foot to foot, and began a grave,<br/>careful combat, "two up and two down." Presently Tom said:<br/><br/>"Now, if you've got the hang, go it lively!"<br/><br/>So they "went it lively," panting and perspiring with the work.<br/>By and by Tom shouted:<br/><br/>"Fall! fall! Why don't you fall?"<br/><br/>"I sha'n't! Why don't you fall yourself? You're getting the<br/>worst of it."<br/><br/>
