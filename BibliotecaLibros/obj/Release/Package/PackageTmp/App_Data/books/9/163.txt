Huck said:

"I can't — I'd die if they was to wake."

Tom urged — Huck held back. At last Tom rose slowly and softly,
and started alone. But the first step he made wrung such a hideous
creak from the crazy floor that he sank down almost dead with
fright. He never made a second attempt. The boys lay there counting
the dragging moments till it seemed to them that time must be done
and eternity growing gray; and then they were grateful to note that
at last the sun was setting.

Now one snore ceased. Injun Joe sat up, stared around — smiled
grimly upon his comrade, whose head was drooping upon his knees —
stirred him up with his foot and said:

"Here! You're a watchman, ain't you! All right, though —
nothing's happened."

"My! have I been asleep?"

"Oh, partly, partly. Nearly time for us to be moving, pard.
What'll we do with what little swag we've got left?"

"I don't know — leave it here as we've always done, I reckon. No
use to take it away till we start south. Six hundred and fifty in
silver's something to carry."

"Well — all right — it won't matter to come here once more."

"No — but I'd say come in the night as we used to do — it's
better."

"Yes: but look here; it may be a good while before I get the
right chance at that job; accidents might happen; 'tain't in such a
very good place; we'll just regularly bury it — and bury it
deep."
