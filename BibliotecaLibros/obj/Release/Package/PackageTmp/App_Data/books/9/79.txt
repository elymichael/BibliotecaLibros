The spirit of adventure rose in the boys' souls once more.

"Hucky, do you das't to go if I lead?"

"I don't like to, much. Tom, s'pose it's Injun Joe!"

Tom quailed. But presently the temptation rose up strong again
and the boys agreed to try, with the understanding that they would
take to their heels if the snoring stopped. So they went tiptoeing
stealthily down, the one behind the other. When they had got to
within five steps of the snorer, Tom stepped on a stick, and it
broke with a sharp snap. The man moaned, writhed a little, and his
face came into the moonlight. It was Muff Potter. The boys' hearts
had stood still, and their hopes too, when the man moved, but their
fears passed away now. They tiptoed out, through the broken
weather-boarding, and stopped at a little distance to exchange a
parting word. That long, lugubrious howl rose on the night air
again! They turned and saw the strange dog standing within a few
feet of where Potter was lying, and facing Potter, with his nose
pointing heavenward.

"Oh, geeminy, it's him!" exclaimed both boys, in a breath.

"Say, Tom — they say a stray dog come howling around Johnny
Miller's house, 'bout midnight, as much as two weeks ago; and a
whippoorwill come in and lit on the banisters and sung, the very
same evening; and there ain't anybody dead there yet."

"Well, I know that. And suppose there ain't. Didn't Gracie
Miller fall in the kitchen fire and burn herself terrible the very
next Saturday?"

"Yes, but she ain't dead. And what's more, she's getting better,
too."

"All right, you wait and see. She's a goner, just as dead sure
as Muff Potter's a goner. That's what the niggers say, and they
know all about these kind of things, Huck."

Then they separated, cogitating. When Tom crept in at his
bedroom window the night was almost spent. He undressed with
excessive caution, and fell asleep congratulating himself that
nobody knew of his escapade. He was not aware that the
gently-snoring Sid was awake, and had been so for an hour.

When Tom awoke, Sid was dressed and gone. There was a late look
in the light, a late sense in the atmosphere. He was startled. Why
had he not been called — persecuted till he was up, as usual? The
thought filled him with bodings. Within five minutes he was dressed
and down-stairs, feeling sore and drowsy. The family were still at
table, but they had finished breakfast. There was no voice of
rebuke; but there were averted eyes; there was a silence and an air
of solemnity that struck a chill to the culprit's heart. He sat
down and tried to seem gay, but it was up-hill work; it roused no
smile, no response, and he lapsed into silence and let his heart
sink down to the depths.
