<br/>"All right, I'll keep still. Now they're stuck. Can't find it.<br/>Here they come again. Now they're hot. Cold again. Hot again. Red<br/>hot! They're p'inted right, this time. Say, Huck, I know another o'<br/>them voices; it's Injun Joe."<br/><br/>"That's so â€” that murderin' half-breed! I'd druther they was<br/>devils a dern sight. What kin they be up to?"<br/><br/>The whisper died wholly out, now, for the three men had reached<br/>the grave and stood within a few feet of the boys'<br/>hiding-place.<br/><br/>"Here it is," said the third voice; and the owner of it held the<br/>lantern up and revealed the face of young Doctor Robinson.<br/><br/>Potter and Injun Joe were carrying a handbarrow with a rope and<br/>a couple of shovels on it. They cast down their load and began to<br/>open the grave. The doctor put the lantern at the head of the grave<br/>and came and sat down with his back against one of the elm trees.<br/>He was so close the boys could have touched him.<br/><br/>"Hurry, men!" he said, in a low voice; "the moon might come out<br/>at any moment."<br/><br/>They growled a response and went on digging. For some time there<br/>was no noise but the grating sound of the spades discharging their<br/>freight of mould and gravel. It was very monotonous. Finally a<br/>spade struck upon the coffin with a dull woody accent, and within<br/>another minute or two the men had hoisted it out on the ground.<br/>They pried off the lid with their shovels, got out the body and<br/>dumped it rudely on the ground. The moon drifted from behind the<br/>clouds and exposed the pallid face. The barrow was got ready and<br/>the corpse placed on it, covered with a blanket, and bound to its<br/>place with the rope. Potter took out a large spring-knife and cut<br/>off the dangling end of the rope and then said:<br/><br/>"Now the cussed thing's ready, Sawbones, and you'll just out<br/>with another five, or here she stays."<br/><br/>"That's the talk!" said Injun Joe.<br/><br/>"Look here, what does this mean?" said the doctor. "You required<br/>your pay in advance, and I've paid you."<br/><br/>
