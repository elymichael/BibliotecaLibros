<br/>"Yes, that's it, Huck — that's it; though when you're burying it<br/>if you say 'Down bean; off wart; come no more to bother me!' it's<br/>better. That's the way Joe Harper does, and he's been nearly to<br/>Coonville and most everywheres. But say — how do you cure 'em with<br/>dead cats?"<br/><br/>"Why, you take your cat and go and get in the graveyard 'long<br/>about midnight when somebody that was wicked has been buried; and<br/>when it's midnight a devil will come, or maybe two or three, but<br/>you can't see 'em, you can only hear something like the wind, or<br/>maybe hear 'em talk; and when they're taking that feller away, you<br/>heave your cat after 'em and say, 'Devil follow corpse, cat follow<br/>devil, warts follow cat, I'm done with ye!' That'll fetch any<br/>wart."<br/><br/>"Sounds right. D'you ever try it, Huck?"<br/><br/>"No, but old Mother Hopkins told me."<br/><br/>"Well, I reckon it's so, then. Becuz they say she's a<br/>witch."<br/><br/>"Say! Why, Tom, I know she is. She witched pap. Pap says so his<br/>own self. He come along one day, and he see she was a-witching him,<br/>so he took up a rock, and if she hadn't dodged, he'd a got her.<br/>Well, that very night he rolled off'n a shed wher' he was a layin<br/>drunk, and broke his arm."<br/><br/>"Why, that's awful. How did he know she was a-witching him?"<br/><br/>"Lord, pap can tell, easy. Pap says when they keep looking at<br/>you right stiddy, they're a-witching you. Specially if they mumble.<br/>Becuz when they mumble they're saying the Lord's Prayer<br/>backards."<br/><br/>"Say, Hucky, when you going to try the cat?"<br/><br/>"To-night. I reckon they'll come after old Hoss Williams<br/>to-night."<br/><br/>
