"Oh, Tom, you didn't make any marks!"

"Becky, I was such a fool! Such a fool! I never thought we might
want to come back! No — I can't find the way. It's all mixed
up."

"Tom, Tom, we're lost! we're lost! We never can get out of this
awful place! Oh, why did we ever leave the others!"

She sank to the ground and burst into such a frenzy of crying
that Tom was appalled with the idea that she might die, or lose her
reason. He sat down by her and put his arms around her; she buried
her face in his bosom, she clung to him, she poured out her
terrors, her unavailing regrets, and the far echoes turned them all
to jeering laughter. Tom begged her to pluck up hope again, and she
said she could not. He fell to blaming and abusing himself for
getting her into this miserable situation; this had a better
effect. She said she would try to hope again, she would get up and
follow wherever he might lead if only he would not talk like that
any more. For he was no more to blame than she, she said.

So they moved on again — aimlessly — simply at random — all they
could do was to move, keep moving. For a little while, hope made a
show of reviving — not with any reason to back it, but only because
it is its nature to revive when the spring has not been taken out
of it by age and familiarity with failure.

By-and-by Tom took Becky's candle and blew it out. This economy
meant so much! Words were not needed. Becky understood, and her
hope died again. She knew that Tom had a whole candle and three or
four pieces in his pockets — yet he must economize.

By-and-by, fatigue began to assert its claims; the children
tried to pay attention, for it was dreadful to think of sitting
down when time was grown to be so precious, moving, in some
direction, in any direction, was at least progress and might bear
fruit; but to sit down was to invite death and shorten its
pursuit.

At last Becky's frail limbs refused to carry her farther. She
sat down. Tom rested with her, and they talked of home, and the
friends there, and the comfortable beds and, above all, the light!
Becky cried, and Tom tried to think of some way of comforting her,
but all his encouragements were grown threadbare with use, and
sounded like sarcasms. Fatigue bore so heavily upon Becky that she
drowsed off to sleep. Tom was grateful. He sat looking into her
drawn face and saw it grow smooth and natural under the influence
of pleasant dreams; and by-and-by a smile dawned and rested there.
The peaceful face reflected somewhat of peace and healing into his
own spirit, and his thoughts wandered away to bygone times and
dreamy memories. While he was deep in his musings, Becky woke up
with a breezy little laugh — but it was stricken dead upon her
lips, and a groan followed it.

"Oh, how could I sleep! I wish I never, never had waked! No! No,
I don't, Tom! Don't look so! I won't say it again."

"I'm glad you've slept, Becky; you'll feel rested, now, and
we'll find the way out."
