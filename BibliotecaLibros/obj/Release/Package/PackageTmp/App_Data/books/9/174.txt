"Well, I reckon maybe that's so. Who'd 'a' thought such a thing?
But say, Tom, now's a mighty good time to get that box, if Injun
Joe's drunk."

"It is, that! You try it!"

Huck shuddered.

"Well, no — I reckon not."

"And I reckon not, Huck. Only one bottle alongside of Injun Joe
ain't enough. If there'd been three, he'd be drunk enough and I'd
do it."

There was a long pause for reflection, and then Tom said:

"Lookyhere, Huck, less not try that thing any more till we know
Injun Joe's not in there. It's too scary. Now, if we watch every
night, we'll be dead sure to see him go out, some time or other,
and then we'll snatch that box quicker'n lightning."

"Well, I'm agreed. I'll watch the whole night long, and I'll do
it every night, too, if you'll do the other part of the job."

"All right, I will. All you got to do is to trot up Hooper
Street a block and maow — and if I'm asleep, you throw some gravel
at the window and that'll fetch me."

"Agreed, and good as wheat!"
