and both shoving with might and main, and glowering at each other
with hate. But neither could get an advantage. After struggling

watchful caution, and Tom said:

"You're a coward and a pup. I'll tell my big brother on you, and
he can thrash you with his little finger, and I'll make him do it,
too."

"What do I care for your big brother? I've got a brother that's
bigger than he is — and what's more, he can throw him over that
fence, too." [Both brothers were imaginary.]

"That's a lie."

"Your saying so don't make it so."

Tom drew a line in the dust with his big toe, and said:

"I dare you to step over that, and I'll lick you till you can't
stand up. Anybody that'll take a dare will steal sheep."

"Now you said you'd do it, now let's see you do it."

"Don't you crowd me now; you better look out."

"Well, you said you'd do it — why don't you do it?"
