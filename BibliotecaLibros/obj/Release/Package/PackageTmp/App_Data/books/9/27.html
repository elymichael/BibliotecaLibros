<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>4<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>The sun rose upon a tranquil world, and beamed down upon the<br/>peaceful village like a benediction. Breakfast over, Aunt Polly had<br/>family worship: it began with a prayer built from the ground up of<br/>solid courses of Scriptural quotations, welded together with a thin<br/>mortar of originality; and from the summit of this she delivered a<br/>grim chapter of the Mosaic Law, as from Sinai.<br/><br/>Then Tom girded up his loins, so to speak, and went to work to<br/>"get his verses." Sid had learned his lesson days before. Tom bent<br/>all his energies to the memorizing of five verses, and he chose<br/>part of the Sermon on the Mount, because he could find no verses<br/>that were shorter. At the end of half an hour Tom had a vague<br/>general idea of his lesson, but no more, for his mind was<br/>traversing the whole field of human thought, and his hands were<br/>busy with distracting recreations. Mary took his book to hear him<br/>recite, and he tried to find his way through the fog:<br/><br/>"Blessed are the — a — a —"<br/><br/>"Poor" —<br/><br/>"Yes — poor; blessed are the poor — a — a —"<br/><br/>"In spirit —"<br/><br/>
