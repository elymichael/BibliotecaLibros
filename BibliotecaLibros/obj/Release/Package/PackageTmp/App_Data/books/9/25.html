<br/>Presently she stepped into the kitchen, and Sid, happy in his<br/>immunity, reached for the sugar-bowl — a sort of glorying over Tom<br/>which was wellnigh unbearable. But Sid's fingers slipped and the<br/>bowl dropped and broke. Tom was in ecstasies. In such ecstasies<br/>that he even controlled his tongue and was silent. He said to<br/>himself that he would not speak a word, even when his aunt came in,<br/>but would sit perfectly still till she asked who did the mischief;<br/>and then he would tell, and there would be nothing so good in the<br/>world as to see that pet model "catch it." He was so brimful of<br/>exultation that he could hardly hold himself when the old lady came<br/>back and stood above the wreck discharging lightnings of wrath from<br/>over her spectacles. He said to himself, "Now it's coming!" And the<br/>next instant he was sprawling on the floor! The potent palm was<br/>uplifted to strike again when Tom cried out:<br/><br/>"Hold on, now, what 'er you belting me for? — Sid broke it!"<br/><br/>Aunt Polly paused, perplexed, and Tom looked for healing pity.<br/>But when she got her tongue again, she only said:<br/><br/>"Umf! Well, you didn't get a lick amiss, I reckon. You been into<br/>some other audacious mischief when I wasn't around, like<br/>enough."<br/><br/>Then her conscience reproached her, and she yearned to say<br/>something kind and loving; but she judged that this would be<br/>construed into a confession that she had been in the wrong, and<br/>discipline forbade that. So she kept silence, and went about her<br/>affairs with a troubled heart. Tom sulked in a corner and exalted<br/>his woes. He knew that in her heart his aunt was on her knees to<br/>him, and he was morosely gratified by the consciousness of it. He<br/>would hang out no signals, he would take notice of none. He knew<br/>that a yearning glance fell upon him, now and then, through a film<br/>of tears, but he refused recognition of it. He pictured himself<br/>lying sick unto death and his aunt bending over him beseeching one<br/>little forgiving word, but he would turn his face to the wall, and<br/>die with that word unsaid. Ah, how would she feel then? And he<br/>pictured himself brought home from the river, dead, with his curls<br/>all wet, and his sore heart at rest. How she would throw herself<br/>upon him, and how her tears would fall like rain, and her lips pray<br/>God to give her back her boy and she would never, never abuse him<br/>any more! But he would lie there cold and white and make no sign —<br/>a poor little sufferer, whose griefs were at an end. He so worked<br/>upon his feelings with the pathos of these dreams, that he had to<br/>keep swallowing, he was so like to choke; and his eyes swam in a<br/>blur of water, which overflowed when he winked, and ran down and<br/>trickled from the end of his nose. And such a luxury to him was<br/>this petting of his sorrows, that he could not bear to have any<br/>worldly cheeriness or any grating delight intrude upon it; it was<br/>too sacred for such contact; and so, presently, when his cousin<br/>Mary danced in, all alive with the joy of seeing home again after<br/>an age-long visit of one week to the country, he got up and moved<br/>in clouds and darkness out at one door as she brought song and<br/>sunshine in at the other.<br/><br/>He wandered far from the accustomed haunts of boys, and sought<br/>desolate places that were in harmony with his spirit. A log raft in<br/>the river invited him, and he seated himself on its outer edge and<br/>contemplated the dreary vastness of the stream, wishing, the while,<br/>that he could only be drowned, all at once and unconsciously,<br/>without undergoing the uncomfortable routine devised by nature.<br/>Then he thought of his flower. He got it out, rumpled and wilted,<br/>and it mightily increased his dismal felicity. He wondered if she<br/>would pity him if she knew? Would she cry, and wish that she had a<br/>right to put her arms around his neck and comfort him? Or would she<br/>turn coldly away like all the hollow world? This picture brought<br/>such an agony of pleasurable suffering that he worked it over and<br/>over again in his mind and set it up in new and varied lights, till<br/>he wore it threadbare. At last he rose up sighing and departed in<br/>the darkness.<br/><br/>About half-past nine or ten o'clock he came along the deserted<br/>street to where the Adored Unknown lived; he paused a moment; no<br/>sound fell upon his listening ear; a candle was casting a dull glow<br/>upon the curtain of a second-story window. Was the sacred presence<br/>there? He climbed the fence, threaded his stealthy way through the<br/>plants, till he stood under that window; he looked up at it long,<br/>and with emotion; then he laid him down on the ground under it,<br/>disposing himself upon his back, with his hands clasped upon his<br/>breast and holding his poor wilted flower. And thus he would die —<br/>out in the cold world, with no shelter over his homeless head, no<br/>friendly hand to wipe the death-damps from his brow, no loving face<br/>to bend pityingly over him when the great agony came. And thus she<br/>would see him when she looked out upon the glad morning, and oh!<br/>would she drop one little tear upon his poor, lifeless form, would<br/>she heave one little sigh to see a bright young life so rudely<br/>blighted, so untimely cut down?<br/><br/>The window went up, a maid-servant's discordant voice profaned<br/>the holy calm, and a deluge of water drenched the prone martyr's<br/>remains!<br/><br/>The strangling hero sprang up with a relieving snort. There was<br/>a whiz as of a missile in the air, mingled with the murmur of a<br/>curse, a sound as of shivering glass followed, and a small, vague<br/>form went over the fence and shot away in the gloom.<br/><br/>Not long after, as Tom, all undressed for bed, was surveying his<br/>drenched garments by the light of a tallow dip, Sid woke up; but if<br/>he had any dim idea of making any "references to allusions," he<br/>thought better of it and held his peace, for there was danger in<br/>Tom's eye.<br/><br/>
