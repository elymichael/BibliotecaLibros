"Becky, I — I don't care for anybody but you."

No reply — but sobs.

"Becky" — pleadingly. "Becky, won't you say something?"

More sobs.

Tom got out his chiefest jewel, a brass knob from the top of an
andiron, and passed it around her so that she could see it, and
said:

"Please, Becky, won't you take it?"

She struck it to the floor. Then Tom marched out of the house
and over the hills and far away, to return to school no more that
day. Presently Becky began to suspect. She ran to the door; he was
not in sight; she flew around to the play-yard; he was not there.
Then she called:

"Tom! Come back, Tom!"

She listened intently, but there was no answer. She had no
companions but silence and loneliness. So she sat down to cry again
and upbraid herself; and by this time the scholars began to gather
again, and she had to hide her griefs and still her broken heart
and take up the cross of a long, dreary, aching afternoon, with
none among the strangers about her to exchange sorrows with.
