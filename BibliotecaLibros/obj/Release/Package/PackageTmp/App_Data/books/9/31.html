<br/>"Look at him, Jim! He's a going up there. Say — look! he's a<br/>going to shake hands with him — he is shaking hands with him! By<br/>jings, don't you wish you was Jeff?"<br/><br/>Mr. Walters fell to "showing off," with all sorts of official<br/>bustlings and activities, giving orders, delivering judgments,<br/>discharging directions here, there, everywhere that he could find a<br/>target. The librarian "showed off" — running hither and thither<br/>with his arms full of books and making a deal of the splutter and<br/>fuss that insect authority delights in. The young lady teachers<br/>"showed off" — bending sweetly over pupils that were lately being<br/>boxed, lifting pretty warning fingers at bad little boys and<br/>patting good ones lovingly. The young gentlemen teachers "showed<br/>off" with small scoldings and other little displays of authority<br/>and fine attention to discipline — and most of the teachers, of<br/>both sexes, found business up at the library, by the pulpit; and it<br/>was business that frequently had to be done over again two or three<br/>times (with much seeming vexation). The little girls "showed off"<br/>in various ways, and the little boys "showed off" with such<br/>diligence that the air was thick with paper wads and the murmur of<br/>scufflings. And above it all the great man sat and beamed a<br/>majestic judicial smile upon all the house, and warmed himself in<br/>the sun of his own grandeur — for he was "showing off," too.<br/><br/>There was only one thing wanting to make Mr. Walters' ecstasy<br/>complete, and that was a chance to deliver a Bible-prize and<br/>exhibit a prodigy. Several pupils had a few yellow tickets, but<br/>none had enough — he had been around among the star pupils<br/>inquiring. He would have given worlds, now, to have that German lad<br/>back again with a sound mind.<br/><br/>And now at this moment, when hope was dead, Tom Sawyer came<br/>forward with nine yellow tickets, nine red tickets, and ten blue<br/>ones, and demanded a Bible. This was a thunderbolt out of a clear<br/>sky. Walters was not expecting an application from this source for<br/>the next ten years. But there was no getting around it — here were<br/>the certified checks, and they were good for their face. Tom was<br/>therefore elevated to a place with the Judge and the other elect,<br/>and the great news was announced from headquarters. It was the most<br/>stunning surprise of the decade, and so profound was the sensation<br/>that it lifted the new hero up to the judicial one's altitude, and<br/>the school had two marvels to gaze upon in place of one. The boys<br/>were all eaten up with envy — but those that suffered the bitterest<br/>pangs were those who perceived too late that they themselves had<br/>contributed to this hated splendor by trading tickets to Tom for<br/>the wealth he had amassed in selling whitewashing privileges. These<br/>despised themselves, as being the dupes of a wily fraud, a guileful<br/>snake in the grass.<br/><br/>The prize was delivered to Tom with as much effusion as the<br/>superintendent could pump up under the circumstances; but it lacked<br/>somewhat of the true gush, for the poor fellow's instinct taught<br/>him that there was a mystery here that could not well bear the<br/>light, perhaps; it was simply preposterous that this boy had<br/>warehoused two thousand sheaves of Scriptural wisdom on his<br/>premises — a dozen would strain his capacity, without a doubt.<br/><br/>Amy Lawrence was proud and glad, and she tried to make Tom see<br/>it in her face — but he wouldn't look. She wondered; then she was<br/>just a grain troubled; next a dim suspicion came and went — came<br/>again; she watched; a furtive glance told her worlds — and then her<br/>heart broke, and she was jealous, and angry, and the tears came and<br/>she hated everybody. Tom most of all (she thought).<br/><br/>Tom was introduced to the Judge; but his tongue was tied, his<br/>breath would hardly come, his heart quaked — partly because of the<br/>awful greatness of the man, but mainly because he was her parent.<br/>He would have liked to fall down and worship him, if it were in the<br/>dark. The Judge put his hand on Tom's head and called him a fine<br/>little man, and asked him what his name was. The boy stammered,<br/>gasped, and got it out:<br/><br/>"Tom."<br/><br/>"Oh, no, not Tom — it is —"<br/><br/>"Thomas."<br/><br/>
