The two boys flew on and on, toward the village, speechless with
horror. They glanced backward over their shoulders from time to
time, apprehensively, as if they feared they might be followed.
Every stump that started up in their path seemed a man and an
enemy, and made them catch their breath; and as they sped by some
outlying cottages that lay near the village, the barking of the
aroused watch-dogs seemed to give wings to their feet.

"If we can only get to the old tannery before we break down!"
whispered Tom, in short catches between breaths. "I can't stand it
much longer."

Huckleberry's hard pantings were his only reply, and the boys
fixed their eyes on the goal of their hopes and bent to their work
to win it. They gained steadily on it, and at last, breast to
breast, they burst through the open door and fell grateful and
exhausted in the sheltering shadows beyond. By and by their pulses
slowed down, and Tom whispered:

"Huckleberry, what do you reckon'll come of this?"

"If Doctor Robinson dies, I reckon hanging'll come of it."

"Do you though?"
