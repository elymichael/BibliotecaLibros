"My goodness, Huck, lookyhere!"

It was the treasure-box, sure enough, occupying a snug little
cavern, along with an empty powder-keg, a couple of guns in leather
cases, two or three pairs of old moccasins, a leather belt, and
some other rubbish well soaked with the water-drip.

"Got it at last!" said Huck, ploughing among the tarnished coins
with his hand. "My, but we're rich, Tom!"

"Huck, I always reckoned we'd get it. It's just too good to
believe, but we have got it, sure! Say — let's not fool around
here. Let's snake it out. Lemme see if I can lift the box."

It weighed about fifty pounds. Tom could lift it, after an
awkward fashion, but could not carry it conveniently.

"I thought so," he said; "They carried it like it was heavy,
that day at the ha'nted house. I noticed that. I reckon I was right
to think of fetching the little bags along."

The money was soon in the bags and the boys took it up to the
cross rock.

"Now less fetch the guns and things," said Huck.

"No, Huck — leave them there. They're just the tricks to have
when we go to robbing. We'll keep them there all the time, and
we'll hold our orgies there, too. It's an awful snug place for
orgies."

"What orgies?"

"I dono. But robbers always have orgies, and of course we've got
to have them, too. Come along, Huck, we've been in here a long
time. It's getting late, I reckon. I'm hungry, too. We'll eat and
smoke when we get to the skiff."
