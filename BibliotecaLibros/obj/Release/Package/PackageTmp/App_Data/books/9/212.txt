The widow said she meant to give Huck a home under her roof and
have him educated; and that when she could spare the money she
would start him in business in a modest way. Tom's chance was come.
He said:

"Huck don't need it. Huck's rich."

Nothing but a heavy strain upon the good manners of the company
kept back the due and proper complimentary laugh at this pleasant
joke. But the silence was a little awkward. Tom broke it:

"Huck's got money. Maybe you don't believe it, but he's got lots
of it. Oh, you needn't smile — I reckon I can show you. You just
wait a minute."

Tom ran out of doors. The company looked at each other with a
perplexed interest — and inquiringly at Huck, who was
tongue-tied.

"Sid, what ails Tom?" said Aunt Polly. "He — well, there ain't
ever any making of that boy out. I never —"

Tom entered, struggling with the weight of his sacks, and Aunt
Polly did not finish her sentence. Tom poured the mass of yellow
coin upon the table and said:

"There — what did I tell you? Half of it's Huck's and half of
it's mine!"

The spectacle took the general breath away. All gazed, nobody
spoke for a moment. Then there was a unanimous call for an
explanation. Tom said he could furnish it, and he did. The tale was
long, but brimful of interest. There was scarcely an interruption
from any one to break the charm of its flow. When he had finished,
Mr. Jones said:

"I thought I had fixed up a little surprise for this occasion,
but it don't amount to anything now. This one makes it sing mighty
small, I'm willing to allow."
