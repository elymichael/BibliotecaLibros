<br/>"With all my heart. I am really tired of exploring so long on<br/>one spot. Come, Jane, take my other arm."<br/><br/>Jane declined it, however, and the husband and wife walked off.<br/>"Happy couple!" said Frank Churchill, as soon as they were out of<br/>hearing:—"How well they suit one another!—Very lucky—marrying as<br/>they did, upon an acquaintance formed only in a public place!—They<br/>only knew each other, I think, a few weeks in Bath! Peculiarly<br/>lucky!— for as to any real knowledge of a person's disposition that<br/>Bath, or any public place, can give—it is all nothing; there can be<br/>no knowledge. It is only by seeing women in their own homes, among<br/>their own set, just as they always are, that you can form any just<br/>judgment. Short of that, it is all guess and luck— and will<br/>generally be ill-luck. How many a man has committed himself on a<br/>short acquaintance, and rued it all the rest of his life!"<br/><br/>Miss Fairfax, who had seldom spoken before, except among her own<br/>confederates, spoke now.<br/><br/>"Such things do occur, undoubtedly."—She was stopped by a cough.<br/>Frank Churchill turned towards her to listen.<br/><br/>"You were speaking," said he, gravely. She recovered her<br/>voice.<br/><br/>"I was only going to observe, that though such unfortunate<br/>circumstances do sometimes occur both to men and women, I cannot<br/>imagine them to be very frequent. A hasty and imprudent attachment<br/>may arise— but there is generally time to recover from it<br/>afterwards. I would be understood to mean, that it can be only<br/>weak, irresolute characters, (whose happiness must be always at the<br/>mercy of chance,) who will suffer an unfortunate acquaintance to be<br/>an inconvenience, an oppression for ever."<br/><br/>He made no answer; merely looked, and bowed in submission; and<br/>soon afterwards said, in a lively tone,<br/><br/>"Well, I have so little confidence in my own judgment, that<br/>whenever I marry, I hope some body will chuse my wife for me. Will<br/>you? (turning to Emma.) Will you chuse a wife for me?—I am sure I<br/>should like any body fixed on by you. You provide for the family,<br/>you know, (with a smile at his father). Find some body for me. I am<br/>in no hurry. Adopt her, educate her."<br/><br/>"And make her like myself."<br/><br/>"By all means, if you can."<br/><br/>
