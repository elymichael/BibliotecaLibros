"I always told you she was—a little; but you will soon overcome<br/>all that part of her reserve which ought to be overcome, all that<br/>has its foundation in diffidence. What arises from discretion must<br/>be honoured."<br/><br/>"You think her diffident. I do not see it."<br/><br/>"My dear Emma," said he, moving from his chair into one close by<br/>her, "you are not going to tell me, I hope, that you had not a<br/>pleasant evening."<br/><br/>"Oh! no; I was pleased with my own perseverance in asking<br/>questions; and amused to think how little information I<br/>obtained."<br/><br/>"I am disappointed," was his only answer.<br/><br/>"I hope every body had a pleasant evening," said Mr. Woodhouse,<br/>in his quiet way. "I had. Once, I felt the fire rather too much;<br/>but then I moved back my chair a little, a very little, and it did<br/>not disturb me. Miss Bates was very chatty and good-humoured, as<br/>she always is, though she speaks rather too quick. However, she is<br/>very agreeable, and Mrs. Bates too, in a different way. I like old<br/>friends; and Miss Jane Fairfax is a very pretty sort of young lady,<br/>a very pretty and a very well-behaved young lady indeed. She must<br/>have found the evening agreeable, Mr. Knightley, because she had<br/>Emma."<br/><br/>"True, sir; and Emma, because she had Miss Fairfax."<br/><br/>Emma saw his anxiety, and wishing to appease it, at least for<br/>the present, said, and with a sincerity which no one could<br/>question—<br/><br/>"She is a sort of elegant creature that one cannot keep one's<br/>eyes from. I am always watching her to admire; and I do pity her<br/>from my heart."<br/><br/>Mr. Knightley looked as if he were more gratified than he cared<br/>to express; and before he could make any reply, Mr. Woodhouse,<br/>whose thoughts were on the Bates's, said—<br/><br/>"It is a great pity that their circumstances should be so<br/>confined! a great pity indeed! and I have often wished—but it is so<br/>little one can venture to do—small, trifling presents, of any thing<br/>uncommon— Now we have killed a porker, and Emma thinks of sending<br/>them a loin or a leg; it is very small and delicate—Hartfield pork<br/>is not like any other pork—but still it is pork—and, my dear Emma,<br/>unless one could be sure of their making it into steaks, nicely<br/>fried, as ours are fried, without the smallest grease, and not<br/>roast it, for no stomach can bear roast pork—I think we had better<br/>send the leg— do not you think so, my dear?"<br/>
