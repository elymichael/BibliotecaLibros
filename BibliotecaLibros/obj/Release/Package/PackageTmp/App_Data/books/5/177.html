<br/>Mr. Knightley was thoughtful again. The result of his reverie<br/>was, "No, Emma, I do not think the extent of my admiration for her<br/>will ever take me by surprize.—I never had a thought of her in that<br/>way, I assure you." And soon afterwards, "Jane Fairfax is a very<br/>charming young woman—but not even Jane Fairfax is perfect. She has<br/>a fault. She has not the open temper which a man would wish for in<br/>a wife."<br/><br/>Emma could not but rejoice to hear that she had a fault. "Well,"<br/>said she, "and you soon silenced Mr. Cole, I suppose?"<br/><br/>"Yes, very soon. He gave me a quiet hint; I told him he was<br/>mistaken; he asked my pardon and said no more. Cole does not want<br/>to be wiser or wittier than his neighbours."<br/><br/>"In that respect how unlike dear Mrs. Elton, who wants to be<br/>wiser and wittier than all the world! I wonder how she speaks of<br/>the Coles— what she calls them! How can she find any appellation<br/>for them, deep enough in familiar vulgarity? She calls you,<br/>Knightley—what can she do for Mr. Cole? And so I am not to be<br/>surprized that Jane Fairfax accepts her civilities and consents to<br/>be with her. Mrs. Weston, your argument weighs most with me. I can<br/>much more readily enter into the temptation of getting away from<br/>Miss Bates, than I can believe in the triumph of Miss Fairfax's<br/>mind over Mrs. Elton. I have no faith in Mrs. Elton's acknowledging<br/>herself the inferior in thought, word, or deed; or in her being<br/>under any restraint beyond her own scanty rule of good-breeding. I<br/>cannot imagine that she will not be continually insulting her<br/>visitor with praise, encouragement, and offers of service; that she<br/>will not be continually detailing her magnificent intentions, from<br/>the procuring her a permanent situation to the including her in<br/>those delightful exploring parties which are to take place in the<br/>barouche-landau."<br/><br/>"Jane Fairfax has feeling," said Mr. Knightley—"I do not accuse<br/>her of want of feeling. Her sensibilities, I suspect, are<br/>strong—and her temper excellent in its power of forbearance,<br/>patience, self-controul; but it wants openness. She is reserved,<br/>more reserved, I think, than she used to be—And I love an open<br/>temper. No—till Cole alluded to my supposed attachment, it had<br/>never entered my head. I saw Jane Fairfax and conversed with her,<br/>with admiration and pleasure always—but with no thought<br/>beyond."<br/><br/>"Well, Mrs. Weston," said Emma triumphantly when he left them,<br/>"what do you say now to Mr. Knightley's marrying Jane Fairfax?"<br/><br/>"Why, really, dear Emma, I say that he is so very much occupied<br/>by the idea of not being in love with her, that I should not wonder<br/>if it were to end in his being so at last. Do not beat me."<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
