<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>6<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>After being long fed with hopes of a speedy visit from Mr. and<br/>Mrs. Suckling, the Highbury world were obliged to endure the<br/>mortification of hearing that they could not possibly come till the<br/>autumn. No such importation of novelties could enrich their<br/>intellectual stores at present. In the daily interchange of news,<br/>they must be again restricted to the other topics with which for a<br/>while the Sucklings' coming had been united, such as the last<br/>accounts of Mrs. Churchill, whose health seemed every day to supply<br/>a different report, and the situation of Mrs. Weston, whose<br/>happiness it was to be hoped might eventually be as much increased<br/>by the arrival of a child, as that of all her neighbours was by the<br/>approach of it.<br/><br/>Mrs. Elton was very much disappointed. It was the delay of a<br/>great deal of pleasure and parade. Her introductions and<br/>recommendations must all wait, and every projected party be still<br/>only talked of. So she thought at first;—but a little consideration<br/>convinced her that every thing need not be put off. Why should not<br/>they explore to Box Hill though the Sucklings did not come? They<br/>could go there again with them in the autumn. It was settled that<br/>they should go to Box Hill. That there was to be such a party had<br/>been long generally known: it had even given the idea of another.<br/>Emma had never been to Box Hill; she wished to see what every body<br/>found so well worth seeing, and she and Mr. Weston had agreed to<br/>chuse some fine morning and drive thither. Two or three more of the<br/>chosen only were to be admitted to join them, and it was to be done<br/>in a quiet, unpretending, elegant way, infinitely superior to the<br/>bustle and preparation, the regular eating and drinking, and picnic<br/>parade of the Eltons and the Sucklings.<br/><br/>This was so very well understood between them, that Emma could<br/>not but feel some surprise, and a little displeasure, on hearing<br/>from Mr. Weston that he had been proposing to Mrs. Elton, as her<br/>brother and sister had failed her, that the two parties should<br/>unite, and go together; and that as Mrs. Elton had very readily<br/>acceded to it, so it was to be, if she had no objection. Now, as<br/>her objection was nothing but her very great dislike of Mrs. Elton,<br/>of which Mr. Weston must already be perfectly aware, it was not<br/>worth bringing forward again:—it could not be done without a<br/>reproof to him, which would be giving pain to his wife; and she<br/>found herself therefore obliged to consent to an arrangement which<br/>she would have done a great deal to avoid; an arrangement which<br/>would probably expose her even to the degradation of being said to<br/>be of Mrs. Elton's party! Every feeling was offended; and the<br/>forbearance of her outward submission left a heavy arrear due of<br/>secret severity in her reflections on the unmanageable goodwill of<br/>Mr. Weston's temper.<br/><br/>"I am glad you approve of what I have done," said he very<br/>comfortably. "But I thought you would. Such schemes as these are<br/>nothing without numbers. One cannot have too large a party. A large<br/>party secures its own amusement. And she is a good-natured woman<br/>after all. One could not leave her out."<br/><br/>Emma denied none of it aloud, and agreed to none of it in<br/>private.<br/><br/>It was now the middle of June, and the weather fine; and Mrs.<br/>Elton was growing impatient to name the day, and settle with Mr.<br/>Weston as to pigeon-pies and cold lamb, when a lame carriage-horse<br/>threw every thing into sad uncertainty. It might be weeks, it might<br/>be only a few days, before the horse were useable; but no<br/>preparations could be ventured on, and it was all melancholy<br/>stagnation. Mrs. Elton's resources were inadequate to such an<br/>attack.<br/><br/>
