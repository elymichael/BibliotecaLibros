"What was I talking of?" said she, beginning again when they<br/>were all in the street.<br/><br/>Emma wondered on what, of all the medley, she would fix.<br/><br/>"I declare I cannot recollect what I was talking of.—Oh! my<br/>mother's spectacles. So very obliging of Mr. Frank Churchill! `Oh!'<br/>said he, `I do think I can fasten the rivet; I like a job of this<br/>kind excessively.'—Which you know shewed him to be so very… .<br/>Indeed I must say that, much as I had heard of him before and much<br/>as I had expected, he very far exceeds any thing… . I do<br/>congratulate you, Mrs. Weston, most warmly. He seems every thing<br/>the fondest parent could… . `Oh!' said he, `I can fasten the rivet.<br/>I like a job of that sort excessively.' I never shall forget his<br/>manner. And when I brought out the baked apples from the closet,<br/>and hoped our friends would be so very obliging as to take some,<br/>`Oh!' said he directly, `there is nothing in the way of fruit half<br/>so good, and these are the finest-looking home-baked apples I ever<br/>saw in my life.' That, you know, was so very… . And I am sure, by<br/>his manner, it was no compliment. Indeed they are very delightful<br/>apples, and Mrs. Wallis does them full justice—only we do not have<br/>them baked more than twice, and Mr. Woodhouse made us promise to<br/>have them done three times— but Miss Woodhouse will be so good as<br/>not to mention it. The apples themselves are the very finest sort<br/>for baking, beyond a doubt; all from Donwell—some of Mr.<br/>Knightley's most liberal supply. He sends us a sack every year; and<br/>certainly there never was such a keeping apple anywhere as one of<br/>his trees—I believe there is two of them. My mother says the<br/>orchard was always famous in her younger days. But I was really<br/>quite shocked the other day— for Mr. Knightley called one morning,<br/>and Jane was eating these apples, and we talked about them and said<br/>how much she enjoyed them, and he asked whether we were not got to<br/>the end of our stock. `I am sure you must be,' said he, `and I will<br/>send you another supply; for I have a great many more than I can<br/>ever use. William Larkins let me keep a larger quantity than usual<br/>this year. I will send you some more, before they get good for<br/>nothing.' So I begged he would not—for really as to ours being<br/>gone, I could not absolutely say that we had a great many left—it<br/>was but half a dozen indeed; but they should be all kept for Jane;<br/>and I could not at all bear that he should be sending us more, so<br/>liberal as he had been already; and Jane said the same. And when he<br/>was gone, she almost quarrelled with me—No, I should not say<br/>quarrelled, for we never had a quarrel in our lives; but she was<br/>quite distressed that I had owned the apples were so nearly gone;<br/>she wished I had made him believe we had a great many left. Oh,<br/>said I, my dear, I did say as much as I could. However, the very<br/>same evening William Larkins came over with a large basket of<br/>apples, the same sort of apples, a bushel at least, and I was very<br/>much obliged, and went down and spoke to William Larkins and said<br/>every thing, as you may suppose. William Larkins is such an old<br/>acquaintance! I am always glad to see him. But, however, I found<br/>afterwards from Patty, that William said it was all the apples of<br/>that sort his master had; he had brought them all—and now his<br/>master had not one left to bake or boil. William did not seem to<br/>mind it himself, he was so pleased to think his master had sold so<br/>many; for William, you know, thinks more of his master's profit<br/>than any thing; but Mrs. Hodges, he said, was quite displeased at<br/>their being all sent away. She could not bear that her master<br/>should not be able to have another apple-tart this spring. He told<br/>Patty this, but bid her not mind it, and be sure not to say any<br/>thing to us about it, for Mrs. Hodges would be cross sometimes, and<br/>as long as so many sacks were sold, it did not signify who ate the<br/>remainder. And so Patty told me, and I was excessively shocked<br/>indeed! I would not have Mr. Knightley know any thing about it for<br/>the world! He would be so very… . I wanted to keep it from Jane's<br/>knowledge; but, unluckily, I had mentioned it before I was<br/>aware."<br/><br/>Miss Bates had just done as Patty opened the door; and her<br/>visitors walked upstairs without having any regular narration to<br/>attend to, pursued only by the sounds of her desultory<br/>good-will.<br/><br/>"Pray take care, Mrs. Weston, there is a step at the turning.<br/>Pray take care, Miss Woodhouse, ours is rather a dark staircase—<br/>rather darker and narrower than one could wish. Miss Smith, pray<br/>take care. Miss Woodhouse, I am quite concerned, I am sure you hit<br/>your foot. Miss Smith, the step at the turning."<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
