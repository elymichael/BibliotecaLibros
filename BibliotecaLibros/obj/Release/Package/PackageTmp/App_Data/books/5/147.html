<br/>She played.<br/><br/>"What felicity it is to hear a tune again which has made one<br/>happy!— If I mistake not that was danced at Weymouth."<br/><br/>She looked up at him for a moment, coloured deeply, and played<br/>something else. He took some music from a chair near the<br/>pianoforte, and turning to Emma, said,<br/><br/>"Here is something quite new to me. Do you know it?—Cramer.— And<br/>here are a new set of Irish melodies. That, from such a quarter,<br/>one might expect. This was all sent with the instrument. Very<br/>thoughtful of Colonel Campbell, was not it?—He knew Miss Fairfax<br/>could have no music here. I honour that part of the attention<br/>particularly; it shews it to have been so thoroughly from the<br/>heart. Nothing hastily done; nothing incomplete. True affection<br/>only could have prompted it."<br/><br/>Emma wished he would be less pointed, yet could not help being<br/>amused; and when on glancing her eye towards Jane Fairfax she<br/>caught the remains of a smile, when she saw that with all the deep<br/>blush of consciousness, there had been a smile of secret delight,<br/>she had less scruple in the amusement, and much less compunction<br/>with respect to her.—This amiable, upright, perfect Jane Fairfax<br/>was apparently cherishing very reprehensible feelings.<br/><br/>He brought all the music to her, and they looked it over<br/>together.— Emma took the opportunity of whispering,<br/><br/>"You speak too plain. She must understand you."<br/><br/>"I hope she does. I would have her understand me. I am not in<br/>the least ashamed of my meaning."<br/><br/>"But really, I am half ashamed, and wish I had never taken up<br/>the idea."<br/><br/>"I am very glad you did, and that you communicated it to me. I<br/>have now a key to all her odd looks and ways. Leave shame to her.<br/>If she does wrong, she ought to feel it."<br/><br/>
