"Can you trust me with such flatterers?—Does my vain spirit ever
tell me I am wrong?"

"Not your vain spirit, but your serious spirit.—If one leads you
wrong, I am sure the other tells you of it."

"I do own myself to have been completely mistaken in Mr. Elton.
There is a littleness about him which you discovered, and which I
did not: and I was fully convinced of his being in love with
Harriet. It was through a series of strange blunders!"

"And, in return for your acknowledging so much, I will do you
the justice to say, that you would have chosen for him better than
he has chosen for himself.—Harriet Smith has some first-rate
qualities, which Mrs. Elton is totally without. An unpretending,
single-minded, artless girl— infinitely to be preferred by any man
of sense and taste to such a woman as Mrs. Elton. I found Harriet
more conversable than I expected."

Emma was extremely gratified.—They were interrupted by the
bustle of Mr. Weston calling on every body to begin dancing
again.

"Come Miss Woodhouse, Miss Otway, Miss Fairfax, what are you all
doing?— Come Emma, set your companions the example. Every body is
lazy! Every body is asleep!"

"I am ready," said Emma, "whenever I am wanted."

"Whom are you going to dance with?" asked Mr. Knightley.

She hesitated a moment, and then replied, "With you, if you will
ask me."

"Will you?" said he, offering his hand.

"Indeed I will. You have shewn that you can dance, and you know
we are not really so much brother and sister as to make it at all
improper."
