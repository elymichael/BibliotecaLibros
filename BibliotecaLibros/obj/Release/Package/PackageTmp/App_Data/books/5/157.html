Her approbation, at<br/>once general and minute, warm and incessant, could not but please;<br/>and for another half-hour they were all walking to and fro, between<br/>the different rooms, some suggesting, some attending, and all in<br/>happy enjoyment of the future. The party did not break up without<br/>Emma's being positively secured for the two first dances by the<br/>hero of the evening, nor without her overhearing Mr. Weston whisper<br/>to his wife, "He has asked her, my dear. That's right. I knew he<br/>would!"<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
