"You think so, do you?—I wanted the opinion of some one who<br/>could really judge. She appeared to me to play well, that is, with<br/>considerable taste, but I know nothing of the matter myself.— I am<br/>excessively fond of music, but without the smallest skill or right<br/>of judging of any body's performance.—I have been used to hear<br/>her's admired; and I remember one proof of her being thought to<br/>play well:—a man, a very musical man, and in love with another<br/>woman—engaged to her—on the point of marriage— would yet never ask<br/>that other woman to sit down to the instrument, if the lady in<br/>question could sit down instead—never seemed to like to hear one if<br/>he could hear the other. That, I thought, in a man of known musical<br/>talent, was some proof."<br/><br/>"Proof indeed!" said Emma, highly amused.—"Mr. Dixon is very<br/>musical, is he? We shall know more about them all, in half an hour,<br/>from you, than Miss Fairfax would have vouchsafed in half a<br/>year."<br/><br/>"Yes, Mr. Dixon and Miss Campbell were the persons; and I<br/>thought it a very strong proof."<br/><br/>"Certainly—very strong it was; to own the truth, a great deal<br/>stronger than, if I had been Miss Campbell, would have been at all<br/>agreeable to me. I could not excuse a man's having more music than<br/>love—more ear than eye—a more acute sensibility to fine sounds than<br/>to my feelings. How did Miss Campbell appear to like it?"<br/><br/>"It was her very particular friend, you know."<br/><br/>"Poor comfort!" said Emma, laughing. "One would rather have a<br/>stranger preferred than one's very particular friend—with a<br/>stranger it might not recur again—but the misery of having a very<br/>particular friend always at hand, to do every thing better than one<br/>does oneself!— Poor Mrs. Dixon! Well, I am glad she is gone to<br/>settle in Ireland."<br/><br/>"You are right. It was not very flattering to Miss Campbell; but<br/>she really did not seem to feel it."<br/><br/>"So much the better—or so much the worse:—I do not know which.<br/>But be it sweetness or be it stupidity in her—quickness of<br/>friendship, or dulness of feeling—there was one person, I think,<br/>who must have felt it: Miss Fairfax herself. She must have felt the<br/>improper and dangerous distinction."<br/><br/>"As to that—I do not—"<br/><br/>"Oh! do not imagine that I expect an account of Miss Fairfax's<br/>sensations from you, or from any body else. They are known to no<br/>human being, I guess, but herself. But if she continued to play<br/>whenever she was asked by Mr. Dixon, one may guess what one<br/>chuses."<br/><br/>"There appeared such a perfectly good understanding among them<br/>all—" he began rather quickly, but checking himself, added,<br/>"however, it is impossible for me to say on what terms they really<br/>were— how it might all be behind the scenes. I can only say that<br/>there was smoothness outwardly. But you, who have known Miss<br/>Fairfax from a child, must be a better judge of her character, and<br/>of how she is likely to conduct herself in critical situations,<br/>than I can be."<br/>
