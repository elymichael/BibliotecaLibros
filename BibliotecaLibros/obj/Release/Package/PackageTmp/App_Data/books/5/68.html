<br/>"My poor dear Isabella," said he, fondly taking her hand, and<br/>interrupting, for a few moments, her busy labours for some one of<br/>her five children—"How long it is, how terribly long since you were<br/>here! And how tired you must be after your journey! You must go to<br/>bed early, my dear—and I recommend a little gruel to you before you<br/>go.—You and I will have a nice basin of gruel together. My dear<br/>Emma, suppose we all have a little gruel."<br/><br/>Emma could not suppose any such thing, knowing as she did, that<br/>both the Mr. Knightleys were as unpersuadable on that article as<br/>herself;—and two basins only were ordered. After a little more<br/>discourse in praise of gruel, with some wondering at its not being<br/>taken every evening by every body, he proceeded to say, with an air<br/>of grave reflection,<br/><br/>"It was an awkward business, my dear, your spending the autumn<br/>at South End instead of coming here. I never had much opinion of<br/>the sea air."<br/><br/>"Mr. Wingfield most strenuously recommended it, sir—or we should<br/>not have gone. He recommended it for all the children, but<br/>particularly for the weakness in little Bella's throat,— both sea<br/>air and bathing."<br/><br/>"Ah! my dear, but Perry had many doubts about the sea doing her<br/>any good; and as to myself, I have been long perfectly convinced,<br/>though perhaps I never told you so before, that the sea is very<br/>rarely of use to any body. I am sure it almost killed me once."<br/><br/>"Come, come," cried Emma, feeling this to be an unsafe subject,<br/>"I must beg you not to talk of the sea. It makes me envious and<br/>miserable;— I who have never seen it! South End is prohibited, if<br/>you please. My dear Isabella, I have not heard you make one inquiry<br/>about Mr. Perry yet; and he never forgets you."<br/><br/>"Oh! good Mr. Perry—how is he, sir?"<br/><br/>"Why, pretty well; but not quite well. Poor Perry is bilious,<br/>and he has not time to take care of himself—he tells me he has not<br/>time to take care of himself—which is very sad—but he is always<br/>wanted all round the country. I suppose there is not a man in such<br/>practice anywhere. But then there is not so clever a man any<br/>where."<br/><br/>"And Mrs. Perry and the children, how are they? do the children<br/>grow? I have a great regard for Mr. Perry. I hope he will be<br/>calling soon. He will be so pleased to see my little ones."<br/><br/>"I hope he will be here to-morrow, for I have a question or two<br/>to ask him about myself of some consequence. And, my dear, whenever<br/>he comes, you had better let him look at little Bella's<br/>throat."<br/><br/>
