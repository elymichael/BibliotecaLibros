"Nay, dear Emma, now I must take his part; for though he has<br/>been wrong in this instance, I have known him long enough to answer<br/>for his having many, very many, good qualities; and—"<br/><br/>"Good God!" cried Emma, not attending to her.—"Mrs. Smallridge,<br/>too! Jane actually on the point of going as governess! What could<br/>he mean by such horrible indelicacy? To suffer her to engage<br/>herself— to suffer her even to think of such a measure!"<br/><br/>"He knew nothing about it, Emma. On this article I can fully<br/>acquit him. It was a private resolution of hers, not communicated<br/>to him—or at least not communicated in a way to carry conviction.—<br/>Till yesterday, I know he said he was in the dark as to her plans.<br/>They burst on him, I do not know how, but by some letter or<br/>message— and it was the discovery of what she was doing, of this<br/>very project of hers, which determined him to come forward at once,<br/>own it all to his uncle, throw himself on his kindness, and, in<br/>short, put an end to the miserable state of concealment that had<br/>been carrying on so long."<br/><br/>Emma began to listen better.<br/><br/>"I am to hear from him soon," continued Mrs. Weston. "He told me<br/>at parting, that he should soon write; and he spoke in a manner<br/>which seemed to promise me many particulars that could not be given<br/>now. Let us wait, therefore, for this letter. It may bring many<br/>extenuations. It may make many things intelligible and excusable<br/>which now are not to be understood. Don't let us be severe, don't<br/>let us be in a hurry to condemn him. Let us have patience. I must<br/>love him; and now that I am satisfied on one point, the one<br/>material point, I am sincerely anxious for its all turning out<br/>well, and ready to hope that it may. They must both have suffered a<br/>great deal under such a system of secresy and concealment."<br/><br/>"His sufferings," replied Emma dryly, "do not appear to have<br/>done him much harm. Well, and how did Mr. Churchill take it?"<br/><br/>"Most favourably for his nephew—gave his consent with scarcely a<br/>difficulty. Conceive what the events of a week have done in that<br/>family! While poor Mrs. Churchill lived, I suppose there could not<br/>have been a hope, a chance, a possibility;—but scarcely are her<br/>remains at rest in the family vault, than her husband is persuaded<br/>to act exactly opposite to what she would have required. What a<br/>blessing it is, when undue influence does not survive the grave!—<br/>He gave his consent with very little persuasion."<br/><br/>"Ah!" thought Emma, "he would have done as much for<br/>Harriet."<br/><br/>"This was settled last night, and Frank was off with the light<br/>this morning. He stopped at Highbury, at the Bates's, I fancy, some<br/>time—and then came on hither; but was in such a hurry to get back<br/>to his uncle, to whom he is just now more necessary than ever,<br/>that, as I tell you, he could stay with us but a quarter of an<br/>hour.— He was very much agitated—very much, indeed—to a degree that<br/>made him appear quite a different creature from any thing I had<br/>ever seen him before.—In addition to all the rest, there had been<br/>the shock of finding her so very unwell, which he had had no<br/>previous suspicion of— and there was every appearance of his having<br/>been feeling a great deal."<br/><br/>"And do you really believe the affair to have been carrying on<br/>with such perfect secresy?—The Campbells, the Dixons, did none of<br/>them know of the engagement?"<br/><br/>Emma could not speak the name of Dixon without a little<br/>blush.<br/>
