One morning, about ten days after Mrs. Churchill's decease, Emma
was called downstairs to Mr. Weston, who "could not stay five
minutes, and wanted particularly to speak with her."— He met her at
the parlour-door, and hardly asking her how she did, in the natural
key of his voice, sunk it immediately, to say, unheard by her
father,

"Can you come to Randalls at any time this morning?—Do, if it be
possible. Mrs. Weston wants to see you. She must see you."

"Is she unwell?"

"No, no, not at all—only a little agitated. She would have
ordered the carriage, and come to you, but she must see you alone,
and that you know—(nodding towards her father)—Humph!—Can you
come?"

"Certainly. This moment, if you please. It is impossible to
refuse what you ask in such a way. But what can be the matter?— Is
she really not ill?"

"Depend upon me—but ask no more questions. You will know it all
in time. The most unaccountable business! But hush, hush!"
