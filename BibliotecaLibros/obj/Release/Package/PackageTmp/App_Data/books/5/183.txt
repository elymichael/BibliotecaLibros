Mrs. Weston was disengaged and Emma began again—"Mr. Frank
Churchill writes one of the best gentleman's hands I ever saw."

"I do not admire it," said Mr. Knightley. "It is too small—
wants strength. It is like a woman's writing."

This was not submitted to by either lady. They vindicated him
against the base aspersion. "No, it by no means wanted strength— it
was not a large hand, but very clear and certainly strong. Had not
Mrs. Weston any letter about her to produce?" No, she had heard
from him very lately, but having answered the letter, had put it
away.

"If we were in the other room," said Emma, "if I had my
writing-desk, I am sure I could produce a specimen. I have a note
of his.— Do not you remember, Mrs. Weston, employing him to write
for you one day?"

"He chose to say he was employed"—

"Well, well, I have that note; and can shew it after dinner to
convince Mr. Knightley."

"Oh! when a gallant young man, like Mr. Frank Churchill," said
Mr. Knightley dryly, "writes to a fair lady like Miss Woodhouse, he
will, of course, put forth his best."

Dinner was on table.—Mrs. Elton, before she could be spoken to,
was ready; and before Mr. Woodhouse had reached her with his
request to be allowed to hand her into the dining-parlour, was
saying—

"Must I go first? I really am ashamed of always leading the
way."

Jane's solicitude about fetching her own letters had not escaped
Emma. She had heard and seen it all; and felt some curiosity to
know whether the wet walk of this morning had produced any. She
suspected that it had; that it would not have been so resolutely
encountered but in full expectation of hearing from some one very
dear, and that it had not been in vain. She thought there was an
air of greater happiness than usual—a glow both of complexion and
spirits.

She could have made an inquiry or two, as to the expedition and
the expense of the Irish mails;—it was at her tongue's end— but she
abstained. She was quite determined not to utter a word that should
hurt Jane Fairfax's feelings; and they followed the other ladies
out of the room, arm in arm, with an appearance of good-will highly
becoming to the beauty and grace of each.
