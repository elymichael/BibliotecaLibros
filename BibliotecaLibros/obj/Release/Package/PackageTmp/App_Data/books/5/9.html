"Poor Mr. and Miss Woodhouse, if you please; but I cannot<br/>possibly say `poor Miss Taylor.' I have a great regard for you and<br/>Emma; but when it comes to the question of dependence or<br/>independence!—At any rate, it must be better to have only one to<br/>please than two."<br/><br/>"Especially when one of those two is such a fanciful,<br/>troublesome creature!" said Emma playfully. "That is what you have<br/>in your head, I know—and what you would certainly say if my father<br/>were not by."<br/><br/>"I believe it is very true, my dear, indeed," said Mr.<br/>Woodhouse, with a sigh. "I am afraid I am sometimes very fanciful<br/>and troublesome."<br/><br/>"My dearest papa! You do not think I could mean you, or suppose<br/>Mr. Knightley to mean you. What a horrible idea! Oh no! I meant<br/>only myself. Mr. Knightley loves to find fault with me, you know—<br/>in a joke—it is all a joke. We always say what we like to one<br/>another."<br/><br/>Mr. Knightley, in fact, was one of the few people who could see<br/>faults in Emma Woodhouse, and the only one who ever told her of<br/>them: and though this was not particularly agreeable to Emma<br/>herself, she knew it would be so much less so to her father, that<br/>she would not have him really suspect such a circumstance as her<br/>not being thought perfect by every body.<br/><br/>"Emma knows I never flatter her," said Mr. Knightley, "but I<br/>meant no reflection on any body. Miss Taylor has been used to have<br/>two persons to please; she will now have but one. The chances are<br/>that she must be a gainer."<br/><br/>"Well," said Emma, willing to let it pass—"you want to hear<br/>about the wedding; and I shall be happy to tell you, for we all<br/>behaved charmingly. Every body was punctual, every body in their<br/>best looks: not a tear, and hardly a long face to be seen. Oh no;<br/>we all felt that we were going to be only half a mile apart, and<br/>were sure of meeting every day."<br/><br/>"Dear Emma bears every thing so well," said her father. "But,<br/>Mr. Knightley, she is really very sorry to lose poor Miss Taylor,<br/>and I am sure she will miss her more than she thinks for."<br/><br/>Emma turned away her head, divided between tears and smiles. "It<br/>is impossible that Emma should not miss such a companion," said Mr.<br/>Knightley. "We should not like her so well as we do, sir, if we<br/>could suppose it; but she knows how much the marriage is to Miss<br/>Taylor's advantage; she knows how very acceptable it must be, at<br/>Miss Taylor's time of life, to be settled in a home of her own, and<br/>how important to her to be secure of a comfortable provision, and<br/>therefore cannot allow herself to feel so much pain as pleasure.<br/>Every friend of Miss Taylor must be glad to have her so happily<br/>married."<br/><br/>"And you have forgotten one matter of joy to me," said Emma,<br/>"and a very considerable one—that I made the match myself. I made<br/>the match, you know, four years ago; and to have it take place, and<br/>be proved in the right, when so many people said Mr. Weston would<br/>never marry again, may comfort me for any thing."<br/><br/>Mr. Knightley shook his head at her. Her father fondly replied,<br/>"Ah! my dear, I wish you would not make matches and foretell<br/>things, for whatever you say always comes to pass. Pray do not make<br/>any more matches."<br/>
