<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>8<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>The wretchedness of a scheme to Box Hill was in Emma's thoughts<br/>all the evening. How it might be considered by the rest of the<br/>party, she could not tell. They, in their different homes, and<br/>their different ways, might be looking back on it with pleasure;<br/>but in her view it was a morning more completely misspent, more<br/>totally bare of rational satisfaction at the time, and more to be<br/>abhorred in recollection, than any she had ever passed. A whole<br/>evening of back-gammon with her father, was felicity to it. There,<br/>indeed, lay real pleasure, for there she was giving up the sweetest<br/>hours of the twenty-four to his comfort; and feeling that,<br/>unmerited as might be the degree of his fond affection and<br/>confiding esteem, she could not, in her general conduct, be open to<br/>any severe reproach. As a daughter, she hoped she was not without a<br/>heart. She hoped no one could have said to her, "How could you be<br/>so unfeeling to your father?— I must, I will tell you truths while<br/>I can." Miss Bates should never again—no, never! If attention, in<br/>future, could do away the past, she might hope to be forgiven. She<br/>had been often remiss, her conscience told her so; remiss, perhaps,<br/>more in thought than fact; scornful, ungracious. But it should be<br/>so no more. In the warmth of true contrition, she would call upon<br/>her the very next morning, and it should be the beginning, on her<br/>side, of a regular, equal, kindly intercourse.<br/><br/>She was just as determined when the morrow came, and went early,<br/>that nothing might prevent her. It was not unlikely, she thought,<br/>that she might see Mr. Knightley in her way; or, perhaps, he might<br/>come in while she were paying her visit. She had no objection. She<br/>would not be ashamed of the appearance of the penitence, so justly<br/>and truly hers. Her eyes were towards Donwell as she walked, but<br/>she saw him not.<br/><br/>"The ladies were all at home." She had never rejoiced at the<br/>sound before, nor ever before entered the passage, nor walked up<br/>the stairs, with any wish of giving pleasure, but in conferring<br/>obligation, or of deriving it, except in subsequent ridicule.<br/><br/>There was a bustle on her approach; a good deal of moving and<br/>talking. She heard Miss Bates's voice, something was to be done in<br/>a hurry; the maid looked frightened and awkward; hoped she would be<br/>pleased to wait a moment, and then ushered her in too soon. The<br/>aunt and niece seemed both escaping into the adjoining room. Jane<br/>she had a distinct glimpse of, looking extremely ill; and, before<br/>the door had shut them out, she heard Miss Bates saying, "Well, my<br/>dear, I shall say you are laid down upon the bed, and I am sure you<br/>are ill enough."<br/><br/>Poor old Mrs. Bates, civil and humble as usual, looked as if she<br/>did not quite understand what was going on.<br/><br/>"I am afraid Jane is not very well," said she, "but I do not<br/>know; they tell me she is well. I dare say my daughter will be here<br/>presently, Miss Woodhouse. I hope you find a chair. I wish Hetty<br/>had not gone. I am very little able—Have you a chair, ma'am? Do you<br/>sit where you like? I am sure she will be here presently."<br/><br/>
