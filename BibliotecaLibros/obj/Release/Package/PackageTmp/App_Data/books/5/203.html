"Can you trust me with such flatterers?—Does my vain spirit ever<br/>tell me I am wrong?"<br/><br/>"Not your vain spirit, but your serious spirit.—If one leads you<br/>wrong, I am sure the other tells you of it."<br/><br/>"I do own myself to have been completely mistaken in Mr. Elton.<br/>There is a littleness about him which you discovered, and which I<br/>did not: and I was fully convinced of his being in love with<br/>Harriet. It was through a series of strange blunders!"<br/><br/>"And, in return for your acknowledging so much, I will do you<br/>the justice to say, that you would have chosen for him better than<br/>he has chosen for himself.—Harriet Smith has some first-rate<br/>qualities, which Mrs. Elton is totally without. An unpretending,<br/>single-minded, artless girl— infinitely to be preferred by any man<br/>of sense and taste to such a woman as Mrs. Elton. I found Harriet<br/>more conversable than I expected."<br/><br/>Emma was extremely gratified.—They were interrupted by the<br/>bustle of Mr. Weston calling on every body to begin dancing<br/>again.<br/><br/>"Come Miss Woodhouse, Miss Otway, Miss Fairfax, what are you all<br/>doing?— Come Emma, set your companions the example. Every body is<br/>lazy! Every body is asleep!"<br/><br/>"I am ready," said Emma, "whenever I am wanted."<br/><br/>"Whom are you going to dance with?" asked Mr. Knightley.<br/><br/>She hesitated a moment, and then replied, "With you, if you will<br/>ask me."<br/><br/>"Will you?" said he, offering his hand.<br/><br/>"Indeed I will. You have shewn that you can dance, and you know<br/>we are not really so much brother and sister as to make it at all<br/>improper."<br/>
