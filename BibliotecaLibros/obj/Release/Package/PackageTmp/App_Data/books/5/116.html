<br/>But neither geography nor tranquillity could come all at once,<br/>and Emma was now in a humour to resolve that they should both come<br/>in time.<br/><br/>The morning of the interesting day arrived, and Mrs. Weston's<br/>faithful pupil did not forget either at ten, or eleven, or twelve<br/>o'clock, that she was to think of her at four.<br/><br/>"My dear, dear anxious friend,"—said she, in mental soliloquy,<br/>while walking downstairs from her own room, "always overcareful for<br/>every body's comfort but your own; I see you now in all your little<br/>fidgets, going again and again into his room, to be sure that all<br/>is right." The clock struck twelve as she passed through the hall.<br/>"'Tis twelve; I shall not forget to think of you four hours hence;<br/>and by this time to-morrow, perhaps, or a little later, I may be<br/>thinking of the possibility of their all calling here. I am sure<br/>they will bring him soon."<br/><br/>She opened the parlour door, and saw two gentlemen sitting with<br/>her father—Mr. Weston and his son. They had been arrived only a few<br/>minutes, and Mr. Weston had scarcely finished his explanation of<br/>Frank's being a day before his time, and her father was yet in the<br/>midst of his very civil welcome and congratulations, when she<br/>appeared, to have her share of surprize, introduction, and<br/>pleasure.<br/><br/>The Frank Churchill so long talked of, so high in interest, was<br/>actually before her—he was presented to her, and she did not think<br/>too much had been said in his praise; he was a very good looking<br/>young man; height, air, address, all were unexceptionable, and his<br/>countenance had a great deal of the spirit and liveliness of his<br/>father's; he looked quick and sensible. She felt immediately that<br/>she should like him; and there was a well-bred ease of manner, and<br/>a readiness to talk, which convinced her that he came intending to<br/>be acquainted with her, and that acquainted they soon must be.<br/><br/>He had reached Randalls the evening before. She was pleased with<br/>the eagerness to arrive which had made him alter his plan, and<br/>travel earlier, later, and quicker, that he might gain half a<br/>day.<br/><br/>"I told you yesterday," cried Mr. Weston with exultation, "I<br/>told you all that he would be here before the time named. I<br/>remembered what I used to do myself. One cannot creep upon a<br/>journey; one cannot help getting on faster than one has planned;<br/>and the pleasure of coming in upon one's friends before the<br/>look-out begins, is worth a great deal more than any little<br/>exertion it needs."<br/><br/>"It is a great pleasure where one can indulge in it," said the<br/>young man, "though there are not many houses that I should presume<br/>on so far; but in coming home I felt I might do any thing."<br/><br/>The word home made his father look on him with fresh<br/>complacency. Emma was directly sure that he knew how to make<br/>himself agreeable; the conviction was strengthened by what<br/>followed. He was very much pleased with Randalls, thought it a most<br/>admirably arranged house, would hardly allow it even to be very<br/>small, admired the situation, the walk to Highbury, Highbury<br/>itself, Hartfield still more, and professed himself to have always<br/>felt the sort of interest in the country which none but one's own<br/>country gives, and the greatest curiosity to visit it. That he<br/>should never have been able to indulge so amiable a feeling before,<br/>passed suspiciously through Emma's brain; but still, if it were a<br/>falsehood, it was a pleasant one, and pleasantly handled. His<br/>manner had no air of study or exaggeration. He did really look and<br/>speak as if in a state of no common enjoyment.<br/><br/>Their subjects in general were such as belong to an opening<br/>acquaintance. On his side were the inquiries,—"Was she a<br/>horsewoman?—Pleasant rides?— Pleasant walks?—Had they a large<br/>neighbourhood?—Highbury, perhaps, afforded society enough?—There<br/>were several very pretty houses in and about it.—Balls—had they<br/>balls?—Was it a musical society?"<br/><br/>
