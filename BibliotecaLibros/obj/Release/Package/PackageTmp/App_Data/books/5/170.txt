"But you, who are so extremely fond of it—there can be no
danger, surely?"

"I should hope not; but really when I look around among my
acquaintance, I tremble. Selina has entirely given up music—never
touches the instrument—though she played sweetly. And the same may
be said of Mrs. Jeffereys—Clara Partridge, that was—and of the two
Milmans, now Mrs. Bird and Mrs. James Cooper; and of more than I
can enumerate. Upon my word it is enough to put one in a fright. I
used to be quite angry with Selina; but really I begin now to
comprehend that a married woman has many things to call her
attention. I believe I was half an hour this morning shut up with
my housekeeper."

"But every thing of that kind," said Emma, "will soon be in so
regular a train—"

"Well," said Mrs. Elton, laughing, "we shall see."

Emma, finding her so determined upon neglecting her music, had
nothing more to say; and, after a moment's pause, Mrs. Elton chose
another subject.

"We have been calling at Randalls," said she, "and found them
both at home; and very pleasant people they seem to be. I like them
extremely. Mr. Weston seems an excellent creature— quite a
first-rate favourite with me already, I assure you. And she appears
so truly good—there is something so motherly and kind-hearted about
her, that it wins upon one directly. She was your governess, I
think?"

Emma was almost too much astonished to answer; but Mrs. Elton
hardly waited for the affirmative before she went on.

"Having understood as much, I was rather astonished to find her
so very lady-like! But she is really quite the gentlewoman."

"Mrs. Weston's manners," said Emma, "were always particularly
good. Their propriety, simplicity, and elegance, would make them
the safest model for any young woman."

"And who do you think came in while we were there?"
