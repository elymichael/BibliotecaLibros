"I do not wonder, Miss Woodhouse," she resumed, "that you should<br/>feel a great difference between the two, as to me or as to any<br/>body. You must think one five hundred million times more above me<br/>than the other. But I hope, Miss Woodhouse, that supposing—that if—<br/>strange as it may appear—. But you know they were your own words,<br/>that more wonderful things had happened, matches of greater<br/>disparity had taken place than between Mr. Frank Churchill and me;<br/>and, therefore, it seems as if such a thing even as this, may have<br/>occurred before— and if I should be so fortunate, beyond<br/>expression, as to— if Mr. Knightley should really—if he does not<br/>mind the disparity, I hope, dear Miss Woodhouse, you will not set<br/>yourself against it, and try to put difficulties in the way. But<br/>you are too good for that, I am sure."<br/><br/>Harriet was standing at one of the windows. Emma turned round to<br/>look at her in consternation, and hastily said,<br/><br/>"Have you any idea of Mr. Knightley's returning your<br/>affection?"<br/><br/>"Yes," replied Harriet modestly, but not fearfully—"I must say<br/>that I have."<br/><br/>Emma's eyes were instantly withdrawn; and she sat silently<br/>meditating, in a fixed attitude, for a few minutes. A few minutes<br/>were sufficient for making her acquainted with her own heart. A<br/>mind like hers, once opening to suspicion, made rapid progress. She<br/>touched— she admitted—she acknowledged the whole truth. Why was it<br/>so much worse that Harriet should be in love with Mr. Knightley,<br/>than with Frank Churchill? Why was the evil so dreadfully increased<br/>by Harriet's having some hope of a return? It darted through her,<br/>with the speed of an arrow, that Mr. Knightley must marry no one<br/>but herself!<br/><br/>Her own conduct, as well as her own heart, was before her in the<br/>same few minutes. She saw it all with a clearness which had never<br/>blessed her before. How improperly had she been acting by Harriet!<br/>How inconsiderate, how indelicate, how irrational, how unfeeling<br/>had been her conduct! What blindness, what madness, had led her on!<br/>It struck her with dreadful force, and she was ready to give it<br/>every bad name in the world. Some portion of respect for herself,<br/>however, in spite of all these demerits— some concern for her own<br/>appearance, and a strong sense of justice by Harriet—(there would<br/>be no need of compassion to the girl who believed herself loved by<br/>Mr. Knightley—but justice required that she should not be made<br/>unhappy by any coldness now,) gave Emma the resolution to sit and<br/>endure farther with calmness, with even apparent kindness.—For her<br/>own advantage indeed, it was fit that the utmost extent of<br/>Harriet's hopes should be enquired into; and Harriet had done<br/>nothing to forfeit the regard and interest which had been so<br/>voluntarily formed and maintained—or to deserve to be slighted by<br/>the person, whose counsels had never led her right.— Rousing from<br/>reflection, therefore, and subduing her emotion, she turned to<br/>Harriet again, and, in a more inviting accent, renewed the<br/>conversation; for as to the subject which had first introduced it,<br/>the wonderful story of Jane Fairfax, that was quite sunk and lost.—<br/>Neither of them thought but of Mr. Knightley and themselves.<br/><br/>Harriet, who had been standing in no unhappy reverie, was yet<br/>very glad to be called from it, by the now encouraging manner of<br/>such a judge, and such a friend as Miss Woodhouse, and only wanted<br/>invitation, to give the history of her hopes with great, though<br/>trembling delight.—Emma's tremblings as she asked, and as she<br/>listened, were better concealed than Harriet's, but they were not<br/>less. Her voice was not unsteady; but her mind was in all the<br/>perturbation that such a development of self, such a burst of<br/>threatening evil, such a confusion of sudden and perplexing<br/>emotions, must create.— She listened with much inward suffering,<br/>but with great outward patience, to Harriet's detail.—Methodical,<br/>or well arranged, or very well delivered, it could not be expected<br/>to be; but it contained, when separated from all the feebleness and<br/>tautology of the narration, a substance to sink her spirit—<br/>especially with the corroborating circumstances, which her own<br/>memory brought in favour of Mr. Knightley's most improved opinion<br/>of Harriet.<br/><br/>Harriet had been conscious of a difference in his behaviour ever<br/>since those two decisive dances.—Emma knew that he had, on that<br/>occasion, found her much superior to his expectation. From that<br/>evening, or at least from the time of Miss Woodhouse's encouraging<br/>her to think of him, Harriet had begun to be sensible of his<br/>talking to her much more than he had been used to do, and of his<br/>having indeed quite a different manner towards her; a manner of<br/>kindness and sweetness!—Latterly she had been more and more aware<br/>of it. When they had been all walking together, he had so often<br/>come and walked by her, and talked so very delightfully!—He seemed<br/>to want to be acquainted with her. Emma knew it to have been very<br/>much the case. She had often observed the change, to almost the<br/>same extent.— Harriet repeated expressions of approbation and<br/>praise from him— and Emma felt them to be in the closest agreement<br/>with what she had known of his opinion of Harriet. He praised her<br/>for being without art or affectation, for having simple, honest,<br/>generous, feelings.— She knew that he saw such recommendations in<br/>Harriet; he had dwelt on them to her more than once.—Much that<br/>lived in Harriet's memory, many little particulars of the notice<br/>she had received from him, a look, a speech, a removal from one<br/>chair to another, a compliment implied, a preference inferred, had<br/>been unnoticed, because unsuspected, by Emma. Circumstances that<br/>might swell to half an hour's relation, and contained multiplied<br/>proofs to her who had seen them, had passed undiscerned by her who<br/>now heard them; but the two latest occurrences to be mentioned, the<br/>two of strongest promise to Harriet, were not without some degree<br/>of witness from Emma herself.—The first, was his walking with her<br/>apart from the others, in the lime-walk at Donwell, where they had<br/>been walking some time before Emma came, and he had taken pains (as<br/>she was convinced) to draw her from the rest to himself—and at<br/>first, he had talked to her in a more particular way than he had<br/>ever done before, in a very particular way indeed!—(Harriet could<br/>not recall it without a blush.) He seemed to be almost asking her,<br/>whether her affections were engaged.— But as soon as she (Miss<br/>Woodhouse) appeared likely to join them, he changed the subject,<br/>and began talking about farming:— The second, was his having sat<br/>talking with her nearly half an hour before Emma came back from her<br/>visit, the very last morning of his being at Hartfield—though, when<br/>he first came in, he had said that he could not stay five<br/>minutes—and his having told her, during their conversation, that<br/>though he must go to London, it was very much against his<br/>inclination that he left home at all, which was much more (as Emma<br/>felt) than he had acknowledged to her. The superior degree of<br/>confidence towards Harriet, which this one article marked, gave her<br/>severe pain.<br/><br/>On the subject of the first of the two circumstances, she did,<br/>after a little reflection, venture the following question. "Might<br/>he not?—Is not it possible, that when enquiring, as you thought,<br/>into the state of your affections, he might be alluding to Mr.<br/>Martin— he might have Mr. Martin's interest in view? But Harriet<br/>rejected the suspicion with spirit.<br/><br/>"Mr. Martin! No indeed!—There was not a hint of Mr. Martin. I<br/>hope I know better now, than to care for Mr. Martin, or to be<br/>suspected of it."<br/><br/>When Harriet had closed her evidence, she appealed to her dear<br/>Miss Woodhouse, to say whether she had not good ground for<br/>hope.<br/>
