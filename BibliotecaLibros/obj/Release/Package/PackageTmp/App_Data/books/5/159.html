Alas! there was soon no leisure for quarrelling with Mr.<br/>Knightley. Two days of joyful security were immediately followed by<br/>the over-throw of every thing. A letter arrived from Mr. Churchill<br/>to urge his nephew's instant return. Mrs. Churchill was unwell— far<br/>too unwell to do without him; she had been in a very suffering<br/>state (so said her husband) when writing to her nephew two days<br/>before, though from her usual unwillingness to give pain, and<br/>constant habit of never thinking of herself, she had not mentioned<br/>it; but now she was too ill to trifle, and must entreat him to set<br/>off for Enscombe without delay.<br/><br/>The substance of this letter was forwarded to Emma, in a note<br/>from Mrs. Weston, instantly. As to his going, it was inevitable. He<br/>must be gone within a few hours, though without feeling any real<br/>alarm for his aunt, to lessen his repugnance. He knew her<br/>illnesses; they never occurred but for her own convenience.<br/><br/>Mrs. Weston added, "that he could only allow himself time to<br/>hurry to Highbury, after breakfast, and take leave of the few<br/>friends there whom he could suppose to feel any interest in him;<br/>and that he might be expected at Hartfield very soon."<br/><br/>This wretched note was the finale of Emma's breakfast. When once<br/>it had been read, there was no doing any thing, but lament and<br/>exclaim. The loss of the ball—the loss of the young man— and all<br/>that the young man might be feeling!—It was too wretched!— Such a<br/>delightful evening as it would have been!—Every body so happy! and<br/>she and her partner the happiest!—"I said it would be so," was the<br/>only consolation.<br/><br/>Her father's feelings were quite distinct. He thought<br/>principally of Mrs. Churchill's illness, and wanted to know how she<br/>was treated; and as for the ball, it was shocking to have dear Emma<br/>disappointed; but they would all be safer at home.<br/><br/>Emma was ready for her visitor some time before he appeared; but<br/>if this reflected at all upon his impatience, his sorrowful look<br/>and total want of spirits when he did come might redeem him. He<br/>felt the going away almost too much to speak of it. His dejection<br/>was most evident. He sat really lost in thought for the first few<br/>minutes; and when rousing himself, it was only to say,<br/><br/>"Of all horrid things, leave-taking is the worst."<br/><br/>"But you will come again," said Emma. "This will not be your<br/>only visit to Randalls."<br/><br/>"Ah!—(shaking his head)—the uncertainty of when I may be able to<br/>return!—I shall try for it with a zeal!—It will be the object of<br/>all my thoughts and cares!—and if my uncle and aunt go to town this<br/>spring—but I am afraid—they did not stir last spring— I am afraid<br/>it is a custom gone for ever."<br/><br/>"Our poor ball must be quite given up."<br/><br/>"Ah! that ball!—why did we wait for any thing?—why not seize the<br/>pleasure at once?—How often is happiness destroyed by preparation,<br/>foolish preparation!—You told us it would be so.—Oh! Miss<br/>Woodhouse, why are you always so right?"<br/>
