<br/>"Your father will not be easy; why do not you go?"<br/><br/>"I am ready, if the others are."<br/><br/>"Shall I ring the bell?"<br/><br/>"Yes, do."<br/><br/>And the bell was rung, and the carriages spoken for. A few<br/>minutes more, and Emma hoped to see one troublesome companion<br/>deposited in his own house, to get sober and cool, and the other<br/>recover his temper and happiness when this visit of hardship were<br/>over.<br/><br/>The carriage came: and Mr. Woodhouse, always the first object on<br/>such occasions, was carefully attended to his own by Mr. Knightley<br/>and Mr. Weston; but not all that either could say could prevent<br/>some renewal of alarm at the sight of the snow which had actually<br/>fallen, and the discovery of a much darker night than he had been<br/>prepared for. "He was afraid they should have a very bad drive. He<br/>was afraid poor Isabella would not like it. And there would be poor<br/>Emma in the carriage behind. He did not know what they had best do.<br/>They must keep as much together as they could;" and James was<br/>talked to, and given a charge to go very slow and wait for the<br/>other carriage.<br/><br/>Isabella stept in after her father; John Knightley, forgetting<br/>that he did not belong to their party, stept in after his wife very<br/>naturally; so that Emma found, on being escorted and followed into<br/>the second carriage by Mr. Elton, that the door was to be lawfully<br/>shut on them, and that they were to have a tete-a-tete drive. It<br/>would not have been the awkwardness of a moment, it would have been<br/>rather a pleasure, previous to the suspicions of this very day; she<br/>could have talked to him of Harriet, and the three-quarters of a<br/>mile would have seemed but one. But now, she would rather it had<br/>not happened. She believed he had been drinking too much of Mr.<br/>Weston's good wine, and felt sure that he would want to be talking<br/>nonsense.<br/><br/>To restrain him as much as might be, by her own manners, she was<br/>immediately preparing to speak with exquisite calmness and gravity<br/>of the weather and the night; but scarcely had she begun, scarcely<br/>had they passed the sweep-gate and joined the other carriage, than<br/>she found her subject cut up—her hand seized—her attention<br/>demanded, and Mr. Elton actually making violent love to her:<br/>availing himself of the precious opportunity, declaring sentiments<br/>which must be already well known, hoping—fearing—adoring—ready to<br/>die if she refused him; but flattering himself that his ardent<br/>attachment and unequalled love and unexampled passion could not<br/>fail of having some effect, and in short, very much resolved on<br/>being seriously accepted as soon as possible. It really was so.<br/>Without scruple—without apology— without much apparent diffidence,<br/>Mr. Elton, the lover of Harriet, was professing himself her lover.<br/>She tried to stop him; but vainly; he would go on, and say it all.<br/>Angry as she was, the thought of the moment made her resolve to<br/>restrain herself when she did speak. She felt that half this folly<br/>must be drunkenness, and therefore could hope that it might belong<br/>only to the passing hour. Accordingly, with a mixture of the<br/>serious and the playful, which she hoped would best suit his half<br/>and half state, she replied,<br/><br/>"I am very much astonished, Mr. Elton. This to me! you forget<br/>yourself— you take me for my friend—any message to Miss Smith I<br/>shall be happy to deliver; but no more of this to me, if you<br/>please."<br/><br/>"Miss Smith!—message to Miss Smith!—What could she possibly<br/>mean!"— And he repeated her words with such assurance of accent,<br/>such boastful pretence of amazement, that she could not help<br/>replying with quickness,<br/><br/>
