<br/>"I promise you to make none for myself, papa; but I must,<br/>indeed, for other people. It is the greatest amusement in the<br/>world! And after such success, you know!—Every body said that Mr.<br/>Weston would never marry again. Oh dear, no! Mr. Weston, who had<br/>been a widower so long, and who seemed so perfectly comfortable<br/>without a wife, so constantly occupied either in his business in<br/>town or among his friends here, always acceptable wherever he went,<br/>always cheerful— Mr. Weston need not spend a single evening in the<br/>year alone if he did not like it. Oh no! Mr. Weston certainly would<br/>never marry again. Some people even talked of a promise to his wife<br/>on her deathbed, and others of the son and the uncle not letting<br/>him. All manner of solemn nonsense was talked on the subject, but I<br/>believed none of it.<br/><br/>"Ever since the day—about four years ago—that Miss Taylor and I<br/>met with him in Broadway Lane, when, because it began to drizzle,<br/>he darted away with so much gallantry, and borrowed two umbrellas<br/>for us from Farmer Mitchell's, I made up my mind on the subject. I<br/>planned the match from that hour; and when such success has blessed<br/>me in this instance, dear papa, you cannot think that I shall leave<br/>off match-making."<br/><br/>"I do not understand what you mean by `success,'" said Mr.<br/>Knightley. "Success supposes endeavour. Your time has been properly<br/>and delicately spent, if you have been endeavouring for the last<br/>four years to bring about this marriage. A worthy employment for a<br/>young lady's mind! But if, which I rather imagine, your making the<br/>match, as you call it, means only your planning it, your saying to<br/>yourself one idle day, `I think it would be a very good thing for<br/>Miss Taylor if Mr. Weston were to marry her,' and saying it again<br/>to yourself every now and then afterwards, why do you talk of<br/>success? Where is your merit? What are you proud of? You made a<br/>lucky guess; and that is all that can be said."<br/><br/>"And have you never known the pleasure and triumph of a lucky<br/>guess?— I pity you.—I thought you cleverer—for, depend upon it a<br/>lucky guess is never merely luck. There is always some talent in<br/>it. And as to my poor word `success,' which you quarrel with, I do<br/>not know that I am so entirely without any claim to it. You have<br/>drawn two pretty pictures; but I think there may be a third—a<br/>something between the do-nothing and the do-all. If I had not<br/>promoted Mr. Weston's visits here, and given many little<br/>encouragements, and smoothed many little matters, it might not have<br/>come to any thing after all. I think you must know Hartfield enough<br/>to comprehend that."<br/><br/>"A straightforward, open-hearted man like Weston, and a<br/>rational, unaffected woman like Miss Taylor, may be safely left to<br/>manage their own concerns. You are more likely to have done harm to<br/>yourself, than good to them, by interference."<br/><br/>"Emma never thinks of herself, if she can do good to others,"<br/>rejoined Mr. Woodhouse, understanding but in part. "But, my dear,<br/>pray do not make any more matches; they are silly things, and break<br/>up one's family circle grievously."<br/><br/>"Only one more, papa; only for Mr. Elton. Poor Mr. Elton! You<br/>like Mr. Elton, papa,—I must look about for a wife for him. There<br/>is nobody in Highbury who deserves him—and he has been here a whole<br/>year, and has fitted up his house so comfortably, that it would be<br/>a shame to have him single any longer—and I thought when he was<br/>joining their hands to-day, he looked so very much as if he would<br/>like to have the same kind office done for him! I think very well<br/>of Mr. Elton, and this is the only way I have of doing him a<br/>service."<br/><br/>"Mr. Elton is a very pretty young man, to be sure, and a very<br/>good young man, and I have a great regard for him. But if you want<br/>to shew him any attention, my dear, ask him to come and dine with<br/>us some day. That will be a much better thing. I dare say Mr.<br/>Knightley will be so kind as to meet him."<br/><br/>"With a great deal of pleasure, sir, at any time," said Mr.<br/>Knightley, laughing, "and I agree with you entirely, that it will<br/>be a much better thing. Invite him to dinner, Emma, and help him to<br/>the best of the fish and the chicken, but leave him to chuse his<br/>own wife. Depend upon it, a man of six or seven-and-twenty can take<br/>care of himself."<br/><br/><br/><br/>
