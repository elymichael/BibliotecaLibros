<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>9<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>Emma did not repent her condescension in going to the Coles. The<br/>visit afforded her many pleasant recollections the next day; and<br/>all that she might be supposed to have lost on the side of<br/>dignified seclusion, must be amply repaid in the splendour of<br/>popularity. She must have delighted the Coles—worthy people, who<br/>deserved to be made happy!—And left a name behind her that would<br/>not soon die away.<br/><br/>Perfect happiness, even in memory, is not common; and there were<br/>two points on which she was not quite easy. She doubted whether she<br/>had not transgressed the duty of woman by woman, in betraying her<br/>suspicions of Jane Fairfax's feelings to Frank Churchill. It was<br/>hardly right; but it had been so strong an idea, that it would<br/>escape her, and his submission to all that she told, was a<br/>compliment to her penetration, which made it difficult for her to<br/>be quite certain that she ought to have held her tongue.<br/><br/>The other circumstance of regret related also to Jane Fairfax;<br/>and there she had no doubt. She did unfeignedly and unequivocally<br/>regret the inferiority of her own playing and singing. She did most<br/>heartily grieve over the idleness of her childhood—and sat down and<br/>practised vigorously an hour and a half.<br/><br/>She was then interrupted by Harriet's coming in; and if<br/>Harriet's praise could have satisfied her, she might soon have been<br/>comforted.<br/><br/>"Oh! if I could but play as well as you and Miss Fairfax!"<br/><br/>"Don't class us together, Harriet. My playing is no more like<br/>her's, than a lamp is like sunshine."<br/><br/>
