<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>16<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>Every body in and about Highbury who had ever visited Mr. Elton,<br/>was disposed to pay him attention on his marriage. Dinner-parties<br/>and evening-parties were made for him and his lady; and invitations<br/>flowed in so fast that she had soon the pleasure of apprehending<br/>they were never to have a disengaged day.<br/><br/>"I see how it is," said she. "I see what a life I am to lead<br/>among you. Upon my word we shall be absolutely dissipated. We<br/>really seem quite the fashion. If this is living in the country, it<br/>is nothing very formidable. From Monday next to Saturday, I assure<br/>you we have not a disengaged day!—A woman with fewer resources than<br/>I have, need not have been at a loss."<br/><br/>No invitation came amiss to her. Her Bath habits made<br/>evening-parties perfectly natural to her, and Maple Grove had given<br/>her a taste for dinners. She was a little shocked at the want of<br/>two drawing rooms, at the poor attempt at rout-cakes, and there<br/>being no ice in the Highbury card-parties. Mrs. Bates, Mrs. Perry,<br/>Mrs. Goddard and others, were a good deal behind-hand in knowledge<br/>of the world, but she would soon shew them how every thing ought to<br/>be arranged. In the course of the spring she must return their<br/>civilities by one very superior party—in which her card-tables<br/>should be set out with their separate candles and unbroken packs in<br/>the true style—and more waiters engaged for the evening than their<br/>own establishment could furnish, to carry round the refreshments at<br/>exactly the proper hour, and in the proper order.<br/><br/>Emma, in the meanwhile, could not be satisfied without a dinner<br/>at Hartfield for the Eltons. They must not do less than others, or<br/>she should be exposed to odious suspicions, and imagined capable of<br/>pitiful resentment. A dinner there must be. After Emma had talked<br/>about it for ten minutes, Mr. Woodhouse felt no unwillingness, and<br/>only made the usual stipulation of not sitting at the bottom of the<br/>table himself, with the usual regular difficulty of deciding who<br/>should do it for him.<br/><br/>The persons to be invited, required little thought. Besides the<br/>Eltons, it must be the Westons and Mr. Knightley; so far it was all<br/>of course— and it was hardly less inevitable that poor little<br/>Harriet must be asked to make the eighth:—but this invitation was<br/>not given with equal satisfaction, and on many accounts Emma was<br/>particularly pleased by Harriet's begging to be allowed to decline<br/>it. "She would rather not be in his company more than she could<br/>help. She was not yet quite able to see him and his charming happy<br/>wife together, without feeling uncomfortable. If Miss Woodhouse<br/>would not be displeased, she would rather stay at home." It was<br/>precisely what Emma would have wished, had she deemed it possible<br/>enough for wishing. She was delighted with the fortitude of her<br/>little friend—for fortitude she knew it was in her to give up being<br/>in company and stay at home; and she could now invite the very<br/>person whom she really wanted to make the eighth, Jane Fairfax.—<br/>Since her last conversation with Mrs. Weston and Mr. Knightley, she<br/>was more conscience-stricken about Jane Fairfax than she had often<br/>been.—Mr. Knightley's words dwelt with her. He had said that Jane<br/>Fairfax received attentions from Mrs. Elton which nobody else paid<br/>her.<br/><br/>"This is very true," said she, "at least as far as relates to<br/>me, which was all that was meant—and it is very shameful.—Of the<br/>same age— and always knowing her—I ought to have been more her<br/>friend.— She will never like me now. I have neglected her too long.<br/>But I will shew her greater attention than I have done."<br/><br/>
