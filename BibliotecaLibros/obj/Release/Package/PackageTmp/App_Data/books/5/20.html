<br/>"Will he, indeed? That will be very bad."<br/><br/>"How much his business engrosses him already is very plain from<br/>the circumstance of his forgetting to inquire for the book you<br/>recommended. He was a great deal too full of the market to think of<br/>any thing else—which is just as it should be, for a thriving man.<br/>What has he to do with books? And I have no doubt that he will<br/>thrive, and be a very rich man in time—and his being illiterate and<br/>coarse need not disturb us."<br/><br/>"I wonder he did not remember the book"—was all Harriet's<br/>answer, and spoken with a degree of grave displeasure which Emma<br/>thought might be safely left to itself. She, therefore, said no<br/>more for some time. Her next beginning was,<br/><br/>"In one respect, perhaps, Mr. Elton's manners are superior to<br/>Mr. Knightley's or Mr. Weston's. They have more gentleness. They<br/>might be more safely held up as a pattern. There is an openness, a<br/>quickness, almost a bluntness in Mr. Weston, which every body likes<br/>in him, because there is so much good-humour with it—but that would<br/>not do to be copied. Neither would Mr. Knightley's downright,<br/>decided, commanding sort of manner, though it suits him very well;<br/>his figure, and look, and situation in life seem to allow it; but<br/>if any young man were to set about copying him, he would not be<br/>sufferable. On the contrary, I think a young man might be very<br/>safely recommended to take Mr. Elton as a model. Mr. Elton is<br/>good-humoured, cheerful, obliging, and gentle. He seems to me to be<br/>grown particularly gentle of late. I do not know whether he has any<br/>design of ingratiating himself with either of us, Harriet, by<br/>additional softness, but it strikes me that his manners are softer<br/>than they used to be. If he means any thing, it must be to please<br/>you. Did not I tell you what he said of you the other day?"<br/><br/>She then repeated some warm personal praise which she had drawn<br/>from Mr. Elton, and now did full justice to; and Harriet blushed<br/>and smiled, and said she had always thought Mr. Elton very<br/>agreeable.<br/><br/>Mr. Elton was the very person fixed on by Emma for driving the<br/>young farmer out of Harriet's head. She thought it would be an<br/>excellent match; and only too palpably desirable, natural, and<br/>probable, for her to have much merit in planning it. She feared it<br/>was what every body else must think of and predict. It was not<br/>likely, however, that any body should have equalled her in the date<br/>of the plan, as it had entered her brain during the very first<br/>evening of Harriet's coming to Hartfield. The longer she considered<br/>it, the greater was her sense of its expediency. Mr. Elton's<br/>situation was most suitable, quite the gentleman himself, and<br/>without low connexions; at the same time, not of any family that<br/>could fairly object to the doubtful birth of Harriet. He had a<br/>comfortable home for her, and Emma imagined a very sufficient<br/>income; for though the vicarage of Highbury was not large, he was<br/>known to have some independent property; and she thought very<br/>highly of him as a good-humoured, well-meaning, respectable young<br/>man, without any deficiency of useful understanding or knowledge of<br/>the world.<br/><br/>She had already satisfied herself that he thought Harriet a<br/>beautiful girl, which she trusted, with such frequent meetings at<br/>Hartfield, was foundation enough on his side; and on Harriet's<br/>there could be little doubt that the idea of being preferred by him<br/>would have all the usual weight and efficacy. And he was really a<br/>very pleasing young man, a young man whom any woman not fastidious<br/>might like. He was reckoned very handsome; his person much admired<br/>in general, though not by her, there being a want of elegance of<br/>feature which she could not dispense with:—but the girl who could<br/>be gratified by a Robert Martin's riding about the country to get<br/>walnuts for her might very well be conquered by Mr. Elton's<br/>admiration.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
