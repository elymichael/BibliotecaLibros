There was a little hesitation in Emma's answer.<br/><br/>"Oh! yes—very—a very pleasing young woman."<br/><br/>"I think her beautiful, quite beautiful."<br/><br/>"Very nicely dressed, indeed; a remarkably elegant gown."<br/><br/>"I am not at all surprized that he should have fallen in<br/>love."<br/><br/>"Oh! no—there is nothing to surprize one at all.—A pretty<br/>fortune; and she came in his way."<br/><br/>"I dare say," returned Harriet, sighing again, "I dare say she<br/>was very much attached to him."<br/><br/>"Perhaps she might; but it is not every man's fate to marry the<br/>woman who loves him best. Miss Hawkins perhaps wanted a home, and<br/>thought this the best offer she was likely to have."<br/><br/>"Yes," said Harriet earnestly, "and well she might, nobody could<br/>ever have a better. Well, I wish them happy with all my heart. And<br/>now, Miss Woodhouse, I do not think I shall mind seeing them again.<br/>He is just as superior as ever;—but being married, you know, it is<br/>quite a different thing. No, indeed, Miss Woodhouse, you need not<br/>be afraid; I can sit and admire him now without any great misery.<br/>To know that he has not thrown himself away, is such a comfort!—<br/>She does seem a charming young woman, just what he deserves. Happy<br/>creature! He called her `Augusta.' How delightful!"<br/><br/>When the visit was returned, Emma made up her mind. She could<br/>then see more and judge better. From Harriet's happening not to be<br/>at Hartfield, and her father's being present to engage Mr. Elton,<br/>she had a quarter of an hour of the lady's conversation to herself,<br/>and could composedly attend to her; and the quarter of an hour<br/>quite convinced her that Mrs. Elton was a vain woman, extremely<br/>well satisfied with herself, and thinking much of her own<br/>importance; that she meant to shine and be very superior, but with<br/>manners which had been formed in a bad school, pert and familiar;<br/>that all her notions were drawn from one set of people, and one<br/>style of living; that if not foolish she was ignorant, and that her<br/>society would certainly do Mr. Elton no good.<br/><br/>Harriet would have been a better match. If not wise or refined<br/>herself, she would have connected him with those who were; but Miss<br/>Hawkins, it might be fairly supposed from her easy conceit, had<br/>been the best of her own set. The rich brother-in-law near Bristol<br/>was the pride of the alliance, and his place and his carriages were<br/>the pride of him.<br/>
