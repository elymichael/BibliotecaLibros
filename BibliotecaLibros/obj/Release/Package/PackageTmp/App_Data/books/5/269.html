She soon resolved, equally as a duty and a pleasure, to employ<br/>half an hour of this holiday of spirits in calling on Miss<br/>Fairfax.— She ought to go—and she was longing to see her; the<br/>resemblance of their present situations increasing every other<br/>motive of goodwill. It would be a secret satisfaction; but the<br/>consciousness of a similarity of prospect would certainly add to<br/>the interest with which she should attend to any thing Jane might<br/>communicate.<br/><br/>She went—she had driven once unsuccessfully to the door, but had<br/>not been into the house since the morning after Box Hill, when poor<br/>Jane had been in such distress as had filled her with compassion,<br/>though all the worst of her sufferings had been unsuspected.— The<br/>fear of being still unwelcome, determined her, though assured of<br/>their being at home, to wait in the passage, and send up her name.—<br/>She heard Patty announcing it; but no such bustle succeeded as poor<br/>Miss Bates had before made so happily intelligible.—No; she heard<br/>nothing but the instant reply of, "Beg her to walk up;"—and a<br/>moment afterwards she was met on the stairs by Jane herself, coming<br/>eagerly forward, as if no other reception of her were felt<br/>sufficient.— Emma had never seen her look so well, so lovely, so<br/>engaging. There was consciousness, animation, and warmth; there was<br/>every thing which her countenance or manner could ever have<br/>wanted.— She came forward with an offered hand; and said, in a low,<br/>but very feeling tone,<br/><br/>"This is most kind, indeed!—Miss Woodhouse, it is impossible for<br/>me to express—I hope you will believe—Excuse me for being so<br/>entirely without words."<br/><br/>Emma was gratified, and would soon have shewn no want of words,<br/>if the sound of Mrs. Elton's voice from the sitting-room had not<br/>checked her, and made it expedient to compress all her friendly and<br/>all her congratulatory sensations into a very, very earnest shake<br/>of the hand.<br/><br/>Mrs. Bates and Mrs. Elton were together. Miss Bates was out,<br/>which accounted for the previous tranquillity. Emma could have<br/>wished Mrs. Elton elsewhere; but she was in a humour to have<br/>patience with every body; and as Mrs. Elton met her with unusual<br/>graciousness, she hoped the rencontre would do them no harm.<br/><br/>She soon believed herself to penetrate Mrs. Elton's thoughts,<br/>and understand why she was, like herself, in happy spirits; it was<br/>being in Miss Fairfax's confidence, and fancying herself acquainted<br/>with what was still a secret to other people. Emma saw symptoms of<br/>it immediately in the expression of her face; and while paying her<br/>own compliments to Mrs. Bates, and appearing to attend to the good<br/>old lady's replies, she saw her with a sort of anxious parade of<br/>mystery fold up a letter which she had apparently been reading<br/>aloud to Miss Fairfax, and return it into the purple and gold<br/>reticule by her side, saying, with significant nods,<br/><br/>"We can finish this some other time, you know. You and I shall<br/>not want opportunities. And, in fact, you have heard all the<br/>essential already. I only wanted to prove to you that Mrs. S.<br/>admits our apology, and is not offended. You see how delightfully<br/>she writes. Oh! she is a sweet creature! You would have doated on<br/>her, had you gone.—But not a word more. Let us be discreet— quite<br/>on our good behaviour.—Hush!—You remember those lines— I forget the<br/>poem at this moment:<br/><br/>"For when a lady's in the case,<br/><br/>"You know all other things give place."<br/><br/>Now I say, my dear, in our case, for lady, read——mum! a word to<br/>the wise.—I am in a fine flow of spirits, an't I? But I want to set<br/>your heart at ease as to Mrs. S.—My representation, you see, has<br/>quite appeased her."<br/><br/>And again, on Emma's merely turning her head to look at Mrs.<br/>Bates's knitting, she added, in a half whisper,<br/>
