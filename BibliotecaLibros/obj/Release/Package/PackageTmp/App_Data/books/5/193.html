<br/>"And if you find them troublesome, you must send them home<br/>again."<br/><br/>"That is very likely. You think so, do not you?"<br/><br/>"I hope I am aware that they may be too noisy for your father—<br/>or even may be some encumbrance to you, if your visiting<br/>engagements continue to increase as much as they have done<br/>lately."<br/><br/>"Increase!"<br/><br/>"Certainly; you must be sensible that the last half-year has<br/>made a great difference in your way of life."<br/><br/>"Difference! No indeed I am not."<br/><br/>"There can be no doubt of your being much more engaged with<br/>company than you used to be. Witness this very time. Here am I come<br/>down for only one day, and you are engaged with a dinner-party!—<br/>When did it happen before, or any thing like it? Your neighbourhood<br/>is increasing, and you mix more with it. A little while ago, every<br/>letter to Isabella brought an account of fresh gaieties; dinners at<br/>Mr. Cole's, or balls at the Crown. The difference which Randalls,<br/>Randalls alone makes in your goings-on, is very great."<br/><br/>"Yes," said his brother quickly, "it is Randalls that does it<br/>all."<br/><br/>"Very well—and as Randalls, I suppose, is not likely to have<br/>less influence than heretofore, it strikes me as a possible thing,<br/>Emma, that Henry and John may be sometimes in the way. And if they<br/>are, I only beg you to send them home."<br/><br/>"No," cried Mr. Knightley, "that need not be the consequence.<br/>Let them be sent to Donwell. I shall certainly be at leisure."<br/><br/>
