<br/>The very first subject after being seated was Maple Grove, "My<br/>brother Mr. Suckling's seat;"—a comparison of Hartfield to Maple<br/>Grove. The grounds of Hartfield were small, but neat and pretty;<br/>and the house was modern and well-built. Mrs. Elton seemed most<br/>favourably impressed by the size of the room, the entrance, and all<br/>that she could see or imagine. "Very like Maple Grove indeed!—She<br/>was quite struck by the likeness!—That room was the very shape and<br/>size of the morning-room at Maple Grove; her sister's favourite<br/>room."— Mr. Elton was appealed to.—"Was not it astonishingly like?—<br/>She could really almost fancy herself at Maple Grove."<br/><br/>"And the staircase—You know, as I came in, I observed how very<br/>like the staircase was; placed exactly in the same part of the<br/>house. I really could not help exclaiming! I assure you, Miss<br/>Woodhouse, it is very delightful to me, to be reminded of a place I<br/>am so extremely partial to as Maple Grove. I have spent so many<br/>happy months there! (with a little sigh of sentiment). A charming<br/>place, undoubtedly. Every body who sees it is struck by its beauty;<br/>but to me, it has been quite a home. Whenever you are transplanted,<br/>like me, Miss Woodhouse, you will understand how very delightful it<br/>is to meet with any thing at all like what one has left behind. I<br/>always say this is quite one of the evils of matrimony."<br/><br/>Emma made as slight a reply as she could; but it was fully<br/>sufficient for Mrs. Elton, who only wanted to be talking<br/>herself.<br/><br/>"So extremely like Maple Grove! And it is not merely the house—<br/>the grounds, I assure you, as far as I could observe, are<br/>strikingly like. The laurels at Maple Grove are in the same<br/>profusion as here, and stand very much in the same way—just across<br/>the lawn; and I had a glimpse of a fine large tree, with a bench<br/>round it, which put me so exactly in mind! My brother and sister<br/>will be enchanted with this place. People who have extensive<br/>grounds themselves are always pleased with any thing in the same<br/>style."<br/><br/>Emma doubted the truth of this sentiment. She had a great idea<br/>that people who had extensive grounds themselves cared very little<br/>for the extensive grounds of any body else; but it was not worth<br/>while to attack an error so double-dyed, and therefore only said in<br/>reply,<br/><br/>"When you have seen more of this country, I am afraid you will<br/>think you have overrated Hartfield. Surry is full of beauties."<br/><br/>"Oh! yes, I am quite aware of that. It is the garden of England,<br/>you know. Surry is the garden of England."<br/><br/>"Yes; but we must not rest our claims on that distinction. Many<br/>counties, I believe, are called the garden of England, as well as<br/>Surry."<br/><br/>"No, I fancy not," replied Mrs. Elton, with a most satisfied<br/>smile." I never heard any county but Surry called so."<br/><br/>Emma was silenced.<br/><br/>
