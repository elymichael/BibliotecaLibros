Harriet bore the intelligence very well—blaming nobody— and in<br/>every thing testifying such an ingenuousness of disposition and<br/>lowly opinion of herself, as must appear with particular advantage<br/>at that moment to her friend.<br/><br/>Emma was in the humour to value simplicity and modesty to the<br/>utmost; and all that was amiable, all that ought to be attaching,<br/>seemed on Harriet's side, not her own. Harriet did not consider<br/>herself as having any thing to complain of. The affection of such a<br/>man as Mr. Elton would have been too great a distinction.— She<br/>never could have deserved him—and nobody but so partial and kind a<br/>friend as Miss Woodhouse would have thought it possible.<br/><br/>Her tears fell abundantly—but her grief was so truly artless,<br/>that no dignity could have made it more respectable in Emma's eyes—<br/>and she listened to her and tried to console her with all her heart<br/>and understanding—really for the time convinced that Harriet was<br/>the superior creature of the two—and that to resemble her would be<br/>more for her own welfare and happiness than all that genius or<br/>intelligence could do.<br/><br/>It was rather too late in the day to set about being<br/>simple-minded and ignorant; but she left her with every previous<br/>resolution confirmed of being humble and discreet, and repressing<br/>imagination all the rest of her life. Her second duty now, inferior<br/>only to her father's claims, was to promote Harriet's comfort, and<br/>endeavour to prove her own affection in some better method than by<br/>match-making. She got her to Hartfield, and shewed her the most<br/>unvarying kindness, striving to occupy and amuse her, and by books<br/>and conversation, to drive Mr. Elton from her thoughts.<br/><br/>Time, she knew, must be allowed for this being thoroughly done;<br/>and she could suppose herself but an indifferent judge of such<br/>matters in general, and very inadequate to sympathise in an<br/>attachment to Mr. Elton in particular; but it seemed to her<br/>reasonable that at Harriet's age, and with the entire extinction of<br/>all hope, such a progress might be made towards a state of<br/>composure by the time of Mr. Elton's return, as to allow them all<br/>to meet again in the common routine of acquaintance, without any<br/>danger of betraying sentiments or increasing them.<br/><br/>Harriet did think him all perfection, and maintained the<br/>non-existence of any body equal to him in person or goodness—and<br/>did, in truth, prove herself more resolutely in love than Emma had<br/>foreseen; but yet it appeared to her so natural, so inevitable to<br/>strive against an inclination of that sort unrequited, that she<br/>could not comprehend its continuing very long in equal force.<br/><br/>If Mr. Elton, on his return, made his own indifference as<br/>evident and indubitable as she could not doubt he would anxiously<br/>do, she could not imagine Harriet's persisting to place her<br/>happiness in the sight or the recollection of him.<br/><br/>Their being fixed, so absolutely fixed, in the same place, was<br/>bad for each, for all three. Not one of them had the power of<br/>removal, or of effecting any material change of society. They must<br/>encounter each other, and make the best of it.<br/><br/>Harriet was farther unfortunate in the tone of her companions at<br/>Mrs. Goddard's; Mr. Elton being the adoration of all the teachers<br/>and great girls in the school; and it must be at Hartfield only<br/>that she could have any chance of hearing him spoken of with<br/>cooling moderation or repellent truth. Where the wound had been<br/>given, there must the cure be found if anywhere; and Emma felt<br/>that, till she saw her in the way of cure, there could be no true<br/>peace for herself.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
