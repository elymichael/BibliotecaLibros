"What did Mr. Weston tell you?"—said Emma, still perplexed.<br/><br/>"Oh! he told me all about it; that Jane Fairfax and Mr. Frank<br/>Churchill are to be married, and that they have been privately<br/>engaged to one another this long while. How very odd!"<br/><br/>It was, indeed, so odd; Harriet's behaviour was so extremely<br/>odd, that Emma did not know how to understand it. Her character<br/>appeared absolutely changed. She seemed to propose shewing no<br/>agitation, or disappointment, or peculiar concern in the discovery.<br/>Emma looked at her, quite unable to speak.<br/><br/>"Had you any idea," cried Harriet, "of his being in love with<br/>her?—You, perhaps, might.—You (blushing as she spoke) who can see<br/>into every body's heart; but nobody else—"<br/><br/>"Upon my word," said Emma, "I begin to doubt my having any such<br/>talent. Can you seriously ask me, Harriet, whether I imagined him<br/>attached to another woman at the very time that I was—tacitly, if<br/>not openly— encouraging you to give way to your own feelings?—I<br/>never had the slightest suspicion, till within the last hour, of<br/>Mr. Frank Churchill's having the least regard for Jane Fairfax. You<br/>may be very sure that if I had, I should have cautioned you<br/>accordingly."<br/><br/>"Me!" cried Harriet, colouring, and astonished. "Why should you<br/>caution me?—You do not think I care about Mr. Frank Churchill."<br/><br/>"I am delighted to hear you speak so stoutly on the subject,"<br/>replied Emma, smiling; "but you do not mean to deny that there was<br/>a time—and not very distant either—when you gave me reason to<br/>understand that you did care about him?"<br/><br/>"Him!—never, never. Dear Miss Woodhouse, how could you so<br/>mistake me?" turning away distressed.<br/><br/>"Harriet!" cried Emma, after a moment's pause—"What do you<br/>mean?— Good Heaven! what do you mean?—Mistake you!—Am I to suppose<br/>then?—"<br/><br/>She could not speak another word.—Her voice was lost; and she<br/>sat down, waiting in great terror till Harriet should answer.<br/><br/>Harriet, who was standing at some distance, and with face turned<br/>from her, did not immediately say any thing; and when she did<br/>speak, it was in a voice nearly as agitated as Emma's.<br/>
