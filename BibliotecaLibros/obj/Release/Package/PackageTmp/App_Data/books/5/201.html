"And what are we to do for a proper partner for her?" said Mr.<br/>Weston. "She will think Frank ought to ask her."<br/><br/>Frank turned instantly to Emma, to claim her former promise; and<br/>boasted himself an engaged man, which his father looked his most<br/>perfect approbation of—and it then appeared that Mrs. Weston was<br/>wanting him to dance with Mrs. Elton himself, and that their<br/>business was to help to persuade him into it, which was done pretty<br/>soon.— Mr. Weston and Mrs. Elton led the way, Mr. Frank Churchill<br/>and Miss Woodhouse followed. Emma must submit to stand second to<br/>Mrs. Elton, though she had always considered the ball as peculiarly<br/>for her. It was almost enough to make her think of marrying. Mrs.<br/>Elton had undoubtedly the advantage, at this time, in vanity<br/>completely gratified; for though she had intended to begin with<br/>Frank Churchill, she could not lose by the change. Mr. Weston might<br/>be his son's superior.— In spite of this little rub, however, Emma<br/>was smiling with enjoyment, delighted to see the respectable length<br/>of the set as it was forming, and to feel that she had so many<br/>hours of unusual festivity before her.— She was more disturbed by<br/>Mr. Knightley's not dancing than by any thing else.—There he was,<br/>among the standers-by, where he ought not to be; he ought to be<br/>dancing,—not classing himself with the husbands, and fathers, and<br/>whist-players, who were pretending to feel an interest in the dance<br/>till their rubbers were made up,—so young as he looked!— He could<br/>not have appeared to greater advantage perhaps anywhere, than where<br/>he had placed himself. His tall, firm, upright figure, among the<br/>bulky forms and stooping shoulders of the elderly men, was such as<br/>Emma felt must draw every body's eyes; and, excepting her own<br/>partner, there was not one among the whole row of young men who<br/>could be compared with him.—He moved a few steps nearer, and those<br/>few steps were enough to prove in how gentlemanlike a manner, with<br/>what natural grace, he must have danced, would he but take the<br/>trouble.—Whenever she caught his eye, she forced him to smile; but<br/>in general he was looking grave. She wished he could love a<br/>ballroom better, and could like Frank Churchill better.— He seemed<br/>often observing her. She must not flatter herself that he thought<br/>of her dancing, but if he were criticising her behaviour, she did<br/>not feel afraid. There was nothing like flirtation between her and<br/>her partner. They seemed more like cheerful, easy friends, than<br/>lovers. That Frank Churchill thought less of her than he had done,<br/>was indubitable.<br/><br/>The ball proceeded pleasantly. The anxious cares, the incessant<br/>attentions of Mrs. Weston, were not thrown away. Every body seemed<br/>happy; and the praise of being a delightful ball, which is seldom<br/>bestowed till after a ball has ceased to be, was repeatedly given<br/>in the very beginning of the existence of this. Of very important,<br/>very recordable events, it was not more productive than such<br/>meetings usually are. There was one, however, which Emma thought<br/>something of.—The two last dances before supper were begun, and<br/>Harriet had no partner;—the only young lady sitting down;— and so<br/>equal had been hitherto the number of dancers, that how there could<br/>be any one disengaged was the wonder!—But Emma's wonder lessened<br/>soon afterwards, on seeing Mr. Elton sauntering about. He would not<br/>ask Harriet to dance if it were possible to be avoided: she was<br/>sure he would not—and she was expecting him every moment to escape<br/>into the card-room.<br/><br/>Escape, however, was not his plan. He came to the part of the<br/>room where the sitters-by were collected, spoke to some, and walked<br/>about in front of them, as if to shew his liberty, and his<br/>resolution of maintaining it. He did not omit being sometimes<br/>directly before Miss Smith, or speaking to those who were close to<br/>her.— Emma saw it. She was not yet dancing; she was working her way<br/>up from the bottom, and had therefore leisure to look around, and<br/>by only turning her head a little she saw it all. When she was<br/>half-way up the set, the whole group were exactly behind her, and<br/>she would no longer allow her eyes to watch; but Mr. Elton was so<br/>near, that she heard every syllable of a dialogue which just then<br/>took place between him and Mrs. Weston; and she perceived that his<br/>wife, who was standing immediately above her, was not only<br/>listening also, but even encouraging him by significant<br/>glances.—The kind-hearted, gentle Mrs. Weston had left her seat to<br/>join him and say, "Do not you dance, Mr. Elton?" to which his<br/>prompt reply was, "Most readily, Mrs. Weston, if you will dance<br/>with me."<br/><br/>"Me!—oh! no—I would get you a better partner than myself. I am<br/>no dancer."<br/><br/>"If Mrs. Gilbert wishes to dance," said he, "I shall have great<br/>pleasure, I am sure—for, though beginning to feel myself rather an<br/>old married man, and that my dancing days are over, it would give<br/>me very great pleasure at any time to stand up with an old friend<br/>like Mrs. Gilbert."<br/><br/>"Mrs. Gilbert does not mean to dance, but there is a young lady<br/>disengaged whom I should be very glad to see dancing—Miss Smith."<br/>"Miss Smith!—oh!—I had not observed.—You are extremely obliging—<br/>and if I were not an old married man.—But my dancing days are over,<br/>Mrs. Weston. You will excuse me. Any thing else I should be most<br/>happy to do, at your command—but my dancing days are over."<br/><br/>Mrs. Weston said no more; and Emma could imagine with what<br/>surprize and mortification she must be returning to her seat. This<br/>was Mr. Elton! the amiable, obliging, gentle Mr. Elton.— She looked<br/>round for a moment; he had joined Mr. Knightley at a little<br/>distance, and was arranging himself for settled conversation, while<br/>smiles of high glee passed between him and his wife.<br/><br/>She would not look again. Her heart was in a glow, and she<br/>feared her face might be as hot.<br/><br/>In another moment a happier sight caught her;—Mr. Knightley<br/>leading Harriet to the set!—Never had she been more surprized,<br/>seldom more delighted, than at that instant. She was all pleasure<br/>and gratitude, both for Harriet and herself, and longed to be<br/>thanking him; and though too distant for speech, her countenance<br/>said much, as soon as she could catch his eye again.<br/><br/>His dancing proved to be just what she had believed it,<br/>extremely good; and Harriet would have seemed almost too lucky, if<br/>it had not been for the cruel state of things before, and for the<br/>very complete enjoyment and very high sense of the distinction<br/>which her happy features announced. It was not thrown away on her,<br/>she bounded higher than ever, flew farther down the middle, and was<br/>in a continual course of smiles.<br/>
