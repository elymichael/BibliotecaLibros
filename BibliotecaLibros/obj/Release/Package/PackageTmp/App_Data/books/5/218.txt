"Is not this most vexations, Knightley?" she cried.—"And such
weather for exploring!—These delays and disappointments are quite
odious. What are we to do?—The year will wear away at this rate,
and nothing done. Before this time last year I assure you we had
had a delightful exploring party from Maple Grove to Kings
Weston."

"You had better explore to Donwell," replied Mr. Knightley.
"That may be done without horses. Come, and eat my strawberries.
They are ripening fast."

If Mr. Knightley did not begin seriously, he was obliged to
proceed so, for his proposal was caught at with delight; and the
"Oh! I should like it of all things," was not plainer in words than
manner. Donwell was famous for its strawberry-beds, which seemed a
plea for the invitation: but no plea was necessary; cabbage-beds
would have been enough to tempt the lady, who only wanted to be
going somewhere. She promised him again and again to come—much
oftener than he doubted—and was extremely gratified by such a proof
of intimacy, such a distinguishing compliment as she chose to
consider it.

"You may depend upon me," said she. "I certainly will come. Name
your day, and I will come. You will allow me to bring Jane
Fairfax?"

"I cannot name a day," said he, "till I have spoken to some
others whom I would wish to meet you."

"Oh! leave all that to me. Only give me a carte-blanche.—I am
Lady Patroness, you know. It is my party. I will bring friends with
me."

"I hope you will bring Elton," said he: "but I will not trouble
you to give any other invitations."

"Oh! now you are looking very sly. But consider—you need not be
afraid of delegating power to me. I am no young lady on her
preferment. Married women, you know, may be safely authorised. It
is my party. Leave it all to me. I will invite your guests."

"No,"—he calmly replied,—"there is but one married woman in the
world whom I can ever allow to invite what guests she pleases to
Donwell, and that one is—"

"—Mrs. Weston, I suppose," interrupted Mrs. Elton, rather
mortified.

"No—Mrs. Knightley;—and till she is in being, I will manage such
matters myself."
