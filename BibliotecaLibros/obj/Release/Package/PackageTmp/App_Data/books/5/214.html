<br/>"Why, to own the truth," cried Miss Bates, who had been trying<br/>in vain to be heard the last two minutes, "if I must speak on this<br/>subject, there is no denying that Mr. Frank Churchill might have—I<br/>do not mean to say that he did not dream it—I am sure I have<br/>sometimes the oddest dreams in the world—but if I am questioned<br/>about it, I must acknowledge that there was such an idea last<br/>spring; for Mrs. Perry herself mentioned it to my mother, and the<br/>Coles knew of it as well as ourselves—but it was quite a secret,<br/>known to nobody else, and only thought of about three days. Mrs.<br/>Perry was very anxious that he should have a carriage, and came to<br/>my mother in great spirits one morning because she thought she had<br/>prevailed. Jane, don't you remember grandmama's telling us of it<br/>when we got home? I forget where we had been walking to— very<br/>likely to Randalls; yes, I think it was to Randalls. Mrs. Perry was<br/>always particularly fond of my mother—indeed I do not know who is<br/>not—and she had mentioned it to her in confidence; she had no<br/>objection to her telling us, of course, but it was not to go<br/>beyond: and, from that day to this, I never mentioned it to a soul<br/>that I know of. At the same time, I will not positively answer for<br/>my having never dropt a hint, because I know I do sometimes pop out<br/>a thing before I am aware. I am a talker, you know; I am rather a<br/>talker; and now and then I have let a thing escape me which I<br/>should not. I am not like Jane; I wish I were. I will answer for it<br/>she never betrayed the least thing in the world. Where is she?—Oh!<br/>just behind. Perfectly remember Mrs. Perry's coming.— Extraordinary<br/>dream, indeed!"<br/><br/>They were entering the hall. Mr. Knightley's eyes had preceded<br/>Miss Bates's in a glance at Jane. From Frank Churchill's face,<br/>where he thought he saw confusion suppressed or laughed away, he<br/>had involuntarily turned to hers; but she was indeed behind, and<br/>too busy with her shawl. Mr. Weston had walked in. The two other<br/>gentlemen waited at the door to let her pass. Mr. Knightley<br/>suspected in Frank Churchill the determination of catching her eye—<br/>he seemed watching her intently—in vain, however, if it were so—<br/>Jane passed between them into the hall, and looked at neither.<br/><br/>There was no time for farther remark or explanation. The dream<br/>must be borne with, and Mr. Knightley must take his seat with the<br/>rest round the large modern circular table which Emma had<br/>introduced at Hartfield, and which none but Emma could have had<br/>power to place there and persuade her father to use, instead of the<br/>small-sized Pembroke, on which two of his daily meals had, for<br/>forty years been crowded. Tea passed pleasantly, and nobody seemed<br/>in a hurry to move.<br/><br/>"Miss Woodhouse," said Frank Churchill, after examining a table<br/>behind him, which he could reach as he sat, "have your nephews<br/>taken away their alphabets—their box of letters? It used to stand<br/>here. Where is it? This is a sort of dull-looking evening, that<br/>ought to be treated rather as winter than summer. We had great<br/>amusement with those letters one morning. I want to puzzle you<br/>again."<br/><br/>Emma was pleased with the thought; and producing the box, the<br/>table was quickly scattered over with alphabets, which no one<br/>seemed so much disposed to employ as their two selves. They were<br/>rapidly forming words for each other, or for any body else who<br/>would be puzzled. The quietness of the game made it particularly<br/>eligible for Mr. Woodhouse, who had often been distressed by the<br/>more animated sort, which Mr. Weston had occasionally introduced,<br/>and who now sat happily occupied in lamenting, with tender<br/>melancholy, over the departure of the "poor little boys," or in<br/>fondly pointing out, as he took up any stray letter near him, how<br/>beautifully Emma had written it.<br/><br/>Frank Churchill placed a word before Miss Fairfax. She gave a<br/>slight glance round the table, and applied herself to it. Frank was<br/>next to Emma, Jane opposite to them—and Mr. Knightley so placed as<br/>to see them all; and it was his object to see as much as he could,<br/>with as little apparent observation. The word was discovered, and<br/>with a faint smile pushed away. If meant to be immediately mixed<br/>with the others, and buried from sight, she should have looked on<br/>the table instead of looking just across, for it was not mixed; and<br/>Harriet, eager after every fresh word, and finding out none,<br/>directly took it up, and fell to work. She was sitting by Mr.<br/>Knightley, and turned to him for help. The word was blunder; and as<br/>Harriet exultingly proclaimed it, there was a blush on Jane's cheek<br/>which gave it a meaning not otherwise ostensible. Mr. Knightley<br/>connected it with the dream; but how it could all be, was beyond<br/>his comprehension. How the delicacy, the discretion of his<br/>favourite could have been so lain asleep! He feared there must be<br/>some decided involvement. Disingenuousness and double dealing<br/>seemed to meet him at every turn. These letters were but the<br/>vehicle for gallantry and trick. It was a child's play, chosen to<br/>conceal a deeper game on Frank Churchill's part.<br/><br/>With great indignation did he continue to observe him; with<br/>great alarm and distrust, to observe also his two blinded<br/>companions. He saw a short word prepared for Emma, and given to her<br/>with a look sly and demure. He saw that Emma had soon made it out,<br/>and found it highly entertaining, though it was something which she<br/>judged it proper to appear to censure; for she said, "Nonsense! for<br/>shame!" He heard Frank Churchill next say, with a glance towards<br/>Jane, "I will give it to her—shall I?"—and as clearly heard Emma<br/>opposing it with eager laughing warmth. "No, no, you must not; you<br/>shall not, indeed."<br/><br/>It was done however. This gallant young man, who seemed to love<br/>without feeling, and to recommend himself without complaisance,<br/>directly handed over the word to Miss Fairfax, and with a<br/>particular degree of sedate civility entreated her to study it. Mr.<br/>Knightley's excessive curiosity to know what this word might be,<br/>made him seize every possible moment for darting his eye towards<br/>it, and it was not long before he saw it to be Dixon. Jane<br/>Fairfax's perception seemed to accompany his; her comprehension was<br/>certainly more equal to the covert meaning, the superior<br/>intelligence, of those five letters so arranged. She was evidently<br/>displeased; looked up, and seeing herself watched, blushed more<br/>deeply than he had ever perceived her, and saying only, "I did not<br/>know that proper names were allowed," pushed away the letters with<br/>even an angry spirit, and looked resolved to be engaged by no other<br/>word that could be offered. Her face was averted from those who had<br/>made the attack, and turned towards her aunt.<br/><br/>"Aye, very true, my dear," cried the latter, though Jane had not<br/>spoken a word—"I was just going to say the same thing. It is time<br/>for us to be going indeed. The evening is closing in, and grandmama<br/>will be looking for us. My dear sir, you are too obliging. We<br/>really must wish you good night."<br/><br/>Jane's alertness in moving, proved her as ready as her aunt had<br/>preconceived. She was immediately up, and wanting to quit the<br/>table; but so many were also moving, that she could not get away;<br/>and Mr. Knightley thought he saw another collection of letters<br/>anxiously pushed towards her, and resolutely swept away by her<br/>unexamined. She was afterwards looking for her shawl—Frank<br/>Churchill was looking also—it was growing dusk, and the room was in<br/>confusion; and how they parted, Mr. Knightley could not tell.<br/><br/>
