"A material difference then," she replied—"and no doubt you were<br/>much my superior in judgment at that period of our lives; but does<br/>not the lapse of one-and-twenty years bring our understandings a<br/>good deal nearer?"<br/><br/>"Yes—a good deal nearer."<br/><br/>"But still, not near enough to give me a chance of being right,<br/>if we think differently."<br/><br/>"I have still the advantage of you by sixteen years' experience,<br/>and by not being a pretty young woman and a spoiled child. Come, my<br/>dear Emma, let us be friends, and say no more about it. Tell your<br/>aunt, little Emma, that she ought to set you a better example than<br/>to be renewing old grievances, and that if she were not wrong<br/>before, she is now."<br/><br/>"That's true," she cried—"very true. Little Emma, grow up a<br/>better woman than your aunt. Be infinitely cleverer and not half so<br/>conceited. Now, Mr. Knightley, a word or two more, and I have done.<br/>As far as good intentions went, we were both right, and I must say<br/>that no effects on my side of the argument have yet proved wrong. I<br/>only want to know that Mr. Martin is not very, very bitterly<br/>disappointed."<br/><br/>"A man cannot be more so," was his short, full answer.<br/><br/>"Ah!—Indeed I am very sorry.—Come, shake hands with me."<br/><br/>This had just taken place and with great cordiality, when John<br/>Knightley made his appearance, and "How d'ye do, George?" and<br/>"John, how are you?" succeeded in the true English style, burying<br/>under a calmness that seemed all but indifference, the real<br/>attachment which would have led either of them, if requisite, to do<br/>every thing for the good of the other.<br/><br/>The evening was quiet and conversable, as Mr. Woodhouse declined<br/>cards entirely for the sake of comfortable talk with his dear<br/>Isabella, and the little party made two natural divisions; on one<br/>side he and his daughter; on the other the two Mr. Knightleys;<br/>their subjects totally distinct, or very rarely mixing—and Emma<br/>only occasionally joining in one or the other.<br/><br/>The brothers talked of their own concerns and pursuits, but<br/>principally of those of the elder, whose temper was by much the<br/>most communicative, and who was always the greater talker. As a<br/>magistrate, he had generally some point of law to consult John<br/>about, or, at least, some curious anecdote to give; and as a<br/>farmer, as keeping in hand the home-farm at Donwell, he had to tell<br/>what every field was to bear next year, and to give all such local<br/>information as could not fail of being interesting to a brother<br/>whose home it had equally been the longest part of his life, and<br/>whose attachments were strong. The plan of a drain, the change of a<br/>fence, the felling of a tree, and the destination of every acre for<br/>wheat, turnips, or spring corn, was entered into with as much<br/>equality of interest by John, as his cooler manners rendered<br/>possible; and if his willing brother ever left him any thing to<br/>inquire about, his inquiries even approached a tone of<br/>eagerness.<br/><br/>While they were thus comfortably occupied, Mr. Woodhouse was<br/>enjoying a full flow of happy regrets and fearful affection with<br/>his daughter.<br/>
