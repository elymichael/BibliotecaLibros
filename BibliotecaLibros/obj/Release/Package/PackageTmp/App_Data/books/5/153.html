<br/>"There is no denying it," he replied. "I agree with you exactly.<br/>A crowd in a little room—Miss Woodhouse, you have the art of giving<br/>pictures in a few words. Exquisite, quite exquisite!—Still,<br/>however, having proceeded so far, one is unwilling to give the<br/>matter up. It would be a disappointment to my father—and<br/>altogether—I do not know that—I am rather of opinion that ten<br/>couple might stand here very well."<br/><br/>Emma perceived that the nature of his gallantry was a little<br/>self-willed, and that he would rather oppose than lose the pleasure<br/>of dancing with her; but she took the compliment, and forgave the<br/>rest. Had she intended ever to marry him, it might have been worth<br/>while to pause and consider, and try to understand the value of his<br/>preference, and the character of his temper; but for all the<br/>purposes of their acquaintance, he was quite amiable enough.<br/><br/>Before the middle of the next day, he was at Hartfield; and he<br/>entered the room with such an agreeable smile as certified the<br/>continuance of the scheme. It soon appeared that he came to<br/>announce an improvement.<br/><br/>"Well, Miss Woodhouse," he almost immediately began, "your<br/>inclination for dancing has not been quite frightened away, I hope,<br/>by the terrors of my father's little rooms. I bring a new proposal<br/>on the subject:—a thought of my father's, which waits only your<br/>approbation to be acted upon. May I hope for the honour of your<br/>hand for the two first dances of this little projected ball, to be<br/>given, not at Randalls, but at the Crown Inn?"<br/><br/>"The Crown!"<br/><br/>"Yes; if you and Mr. Woodhouse see no objection, and I trust you<br/>cannot, my father hopes his friends will be so kind as to visit him<br/>there. Better accommodations, he can promise them, and not a less<br/>grateful welcome than at Randalls. It is his own idea. Mrs. Weston<br/>sees no objection to it, provided you are satisfied. This is what<br/>we all feel. Oh! you were perfectly right! Ten couple, in either of<br/>the Randalls rooms, would have been insufferable!—Dreadful!—I felt<br/>how right you were the whole time, but was too anxious for securing<br/>any thing to like to yield. Is not it a good exchange?—You consent—<br/>I hope you consent?"<br/><br/>"It appears to me a plan that nobody can object to, if Mr. and<br/>Mrs. Weston do not. I think it admirable; and, as far as I can<br/>answer for myself, shall be most happy—It seems the only<br/>improvement that could be. Papa, do you not think it an excellent<br/>improvement?"<br/><br/>She was obliged to repeat and explain it, before it was fully<br/>comprehended; and then, being quite new, farther representations<br/>were necessary to make it acceptable.<br/><br/>"No; he thought it very far from an improvement—a very bad plan—<br/>much worse than the other. A room at an inn was always damp and<br/>dangerous; never properly aired, or fit to be inhabited. If they<br/>must dance, they had better dance at Randalls. He had never been in<br/>the room at the Crown in his life—did not know the people who kept<br/>it by sight.—Oh! no—a very bad plan. They would catch worse colds<br/>at the Crown than anywhere."<br/><br/>"I was going to observe, sir," said Frank Churchill, "that one<br/>of the great recommendations of this change would be the very<br/>little danger of any body's catching cold— so much less danger at<br/>the Crown than at Randalls! Mr. Perry might have reason to regret<br/>the alteration, but nobody else could."<br/><br/>
