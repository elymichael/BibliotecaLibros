They remained but a few minutes together, as Miss Woodhouse must<br/>not be kept waiting; and Harriet then came running to her with a<br/>smiling face, and in a flutter of spirits, which Miss Woodhouse<br/>hoped very soon to compose.<br/><br/>"Only think of our happening to meet him!—How very odd! It was<br/>quite a chance, he said, that he had not gone round by Randalls. He<br/>did not think we ever walked this road. He thought we walked<br/>towards Randalls most days. He has not been able to get the Romance<br/>of the Forest yet. He was so busy the last time he was at Kingston<br/>that he quite forgot it, but he goes again to-morrow. So very odd<br/>we should happen to meet! Well, Miss Woodhouse, is he like what you<br/>expected? What do you think of him? Do you think him so very<br/>plain?"<br/><br/>"He is very plain, undoubtedly—remarkably plain:—but that is<br/>nothing compared with his entire want of gentility. I had no right<br/>to expect much, and I did not expect much; but I had no idea that<br/>he could be so very clownish, so totally without air. I had<br/>imagined him, I confess, a degree or two nearer gentility."<br/><br/>"To be sure," said Harriet, in a mortified voice, "he is not so<br/>genteel as real gentlemen."<br/><br/>"I think, Harriet, since your acquaintance with us, you have<br/>been repeatedly in the company of some such very real gentlemen,<br/>that you must yourself be struck with the difference in Mr. Martin.<br/>At Hartfield, you have had very good specimens of well educated,<br/>well bred men. I should be surprized if, after seeing them, you<br/>could be in company with Mr. Martin again without perceiving him to<br/>be a very inferior creature—and rather wondering at yourself for<br/>having ever thought him at all agreeable before. Do not you begin<br/>to feel that now? Were not you struck? I am sure you must have been<br/>struck by his awkward look and abrupt manner, and the uncouthness<br/>of a voice which I heard to be wholly unmodulated as I stood<br/>here."<br/><br/>"Certainly, he is not like Mr. Knightley. He has not such a fine<br/>air and way of walking as Mr. Knightley. I see the difference plain<br/>enough. But Mr. Knightley is so very fine a man!"<br/><br/>"Mr. Knightley's air is so remarkably good that it is not fair<br/>to compare Mr. Martin with him. You might not see one in a hundred<br/>with gentleman so plainly written as in Mr. Knightley. But he is<br/>not the only gentleman you have been lately used to. What say you<br/>to Mr. Weston and Mr. Elton? Compare Mr. Martin with either of<br/>them. Compare their manner of carrying themselves; of walking; of<br/>speaking; of being silent. You must see the difference."<br/><br/>"Oh yes!—there is a great difference. But Mr. Weston is almost<br/>an old man. Mr. Weston must be between forty and fifty."<br/><br/>"Which makes his good manners the more valuable. The older a<br/>person grows, Harriet, the more important it is that their manners<br/>should not be bad; the more glaring and disgusting any loudness, or<br/>coarseness, or awkwardness becomes. What is passable in youth is<br/>detestable in later age. Mr. Martin is now awkward and abrupt; what<br/>will he be at Mr. Weston's time of life?"<br/><br/>"There is no saying, indeed," replied Harriet rather<br/>solemnly.<br/><br/>"But there may be pretty good guessing. He will be a completely<br/>gross, vulgar farmer, totally inattentive to appearances, and<br/>thinking of nothing but profit and loss."<br/>
