<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>8<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>Harriet slept at Hartfield that night. For some weeks past she<br/>had been spending more than half her time there, and gradually<br/>getting to have a bed-room appropriated to herself; and Emma judged<br/>it best in every respect, safest and kindest, to keep her with them<br/>as much as possible just at present. She was obliged to go the next<br/>morning for an hour or two to Mrs. Goddard's, but it was then to be<br/>settled that she should return to Hartfield, to make a regular<br/>visit of some days.<br/><br/>While she was gone, Mr. Knightley called, and sat some time with<br/>Mr. Woodhouse and Emma, till Mr. Woodhouse, who had previously made<br/>up his mind to walk out, was persuaded by his daughter not to defer<br/>it, and was induced by the entreaties of both, though against the<br/>scruples of his own civility, to leave Mr. Knightley for that<br/>purpose. Mr. Knightley, who had nothing of ceremony about him, was<br/>offering by his short, decided answers, an amusing contrast to the<br/>protracted apologies and civil hesitations of the other.<br/><br/>"Well, I believe, if you will excuse me, Mr. Knightley, if you<br/>will not consider me as doing a very rude thing, I shall take<br/>Emma's advice and go out for a quarter of an hour. As the sun is<br/>out, I believe I had better take my three turns while I can. I<br/>treat you without ceremony, Mr. Knightley. We invalids think we are<br/>privileged people."<br/><br/>"My dear sir, do not make a stranger of me."<br/><br/>"I leave an excellent substitute in my daughter. Emma will be<br/>happy to entertain you. And therefore I think I will beg your<br/>excuse and take my three turnsâ€”my winter walk."<br/><br/>"You cannot do better, sir."<br/><br/>
