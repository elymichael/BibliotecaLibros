Emma was delighted, and only wanted him to go on in the same
style; but his mind was the next moment in his own concerns and
with his own Jane, and his next words were,

"Did you ever see such a skin?—such smoothness! such delicacy!—
and yet without being actually fair.—One cannot call her fair. It
is a most uncommon complexion, with her dark eye-lashes and hair— a
most distinguishing complexion! So peculiarly the lady in it.— Just
colour enough for beauty."

"I have always admired her complexion," replied Emma, archly;
"but do not I remember the time when you found fault with her for
being so pale?— When we first began to talk of her.—Have you quite
forgotten?"

"Oh! no—what an impudent dog I was!—How could I dare—"

But he laughed so heartily at the recollection, that Emma could
not help saying,

"I do suspect that in the midst of your perplexities at that
time, you had very great amusement in tricking us all.—I am sure
you had.— I am sure it was a consolation to you."

"Oh! no, no, no—how can you suspect me of such a thing? I was
the most miserable wretch!"

"Not quite so miserable as to be insensible to mirth. I am sure
it was a source of high entertainment to you, to feel that you were
taking us all in.—Perhaps I am the readier to suspect, because, to
tell you the truth, I think it might have been some amusement to
myself in the same situation. I think there is a little likeness
between us."

He bowed.

"If not in our dispositions," she presently added, with a look
of true sensibility, "there is a likeness in our destiny; the
destiny which bids fair to connect us with two characters so much
superior to our own."
