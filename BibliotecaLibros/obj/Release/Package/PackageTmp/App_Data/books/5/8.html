<br/>"They are to be put into Mr. Weston's stable, papa. You know we<br/>have settled all that already. We talked it all over with Mr.<br/>Weston last night. And as for James, you may be very sure he will<br/>always like going to Randalls, because of his daughter's being<br/>housemaid there. I only doubt whether he will ever take us anywhere<br/>else. That was your doing, papa. You got Hannah that good place.<br/>Nobody thought of Hannah till you mentioned her—James is so obliged<br/>to you!"<br/><br/>"I am very glad I did think of her. It was very lucky, for I<br/>would not have had poor James think himself slighted upon any<br/>account; and I am sure she will make a very good servant: she is a<br/>civil, pretty-spoken girl; I have a great opinion of her. Whenever<br/>I see her, she always curtseys and asks me how I do, in a very<br/>pretty manner; and when you have had her here to do needlework, I<br/>observe she always turns the lock of the door the right way and<br/>never bangs it. I am sure she will be an excellent servant; and it<br/>will be a great comfort to poor Miss Taylor to have somebody about<br/>her that she is used to see. Whenever James goes over to see his<br/>daughter, you know, she will be hearing of us. He will be able to<br/>tell her how we all are."<br/><br/>Emma spared no exertions to maintain this happier flow of ideas,<br/>and hoped, by the help of backgammon, to get her father tolerably<br/>through the evening, and be attacked by no regrets but her own. The<br/>backgammon-table was placed; but a visitor immediately afterwards<br/>walked in and made it unnecessary.<br/><br/>Mr. Knightley, a sensible man about seven or eight-and-thirty,<br/>was not only a very old and intimate friend of the family, but<br/>particularly connected with it, as the elder brother of Isabella's<br/>husband. He lived about a mile from Highbury, was a frequent<br/>visitor, and always welcome, and at this time more welcome than<br/>usual, as coming directly from their mutual connexions in London.<br/>He had returned to a late dinner, after some days' absence, and now<br/>walked up to Hartfield to say that all were well in Brunswick<br/>Square. It was a happy circumstance, and animated Mr. Woodhouse for<br/>some time. Mr. Knightley had a cheerful manner, which always did<br/>him good; and his many inquiries after "poor Isabella" and her<br/>children were answered most satisfactorily. When this was over, Mr.<br/>Woodhouse gratefully observed, "It is very kind of you, Mr.<br/>Knightley, to come out at this late hour to call upon us. I am<br/>afraid you must have had a shocking walk."<br/><br/>"Not at all, sir. It is a beautiful moonlight night; and so mild<br/>that I must draw back from your great fire."<br/><br/>"But you must have found it very damp and dirty. I wish you may<br/>not catch cold."<br/><br/>"Dirty, sir! Look at my shoes. Not a speck on them."<br/><br/>"Well! that is quite surprising, for we have had a vast deal of<br/>rain here. It rained dreadfully hard for half an hour while we were<br/>at breakfast. I wanted them to put off the wedding."<br/><br/>"By the bye—I have not wished you joy. Being pretty well aware<br/>of what sort of joy you must both be feeling, I have been in no<br/>hurry with my congratulations; but I hope it all went off tolerably<br/>well. How did you all behave? Who cried most?"<br/><br/>"Ah! poor Miss Taylor! 'Tis a sad business."<br/><br/>
