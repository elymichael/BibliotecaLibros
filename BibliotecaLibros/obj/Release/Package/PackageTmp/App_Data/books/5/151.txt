It may be possible to do without dancing entirely. Instances
have been known of young people passing many, many months
successively, without being at any ball of any description, and no
material injury accrue either to body or mind;—but when a beginning
is made— when the felicities of rapid motion have once been, though
slightly, felt—it must be a very heavy set that does not ask for
more.

Frank Churchill had danced once at Highbury, and longed to dance
again; and the last half-hour of an evening which Mr. Woodhouse was
persuaded to spend with his daughter at Randalls, was passed by the
two young people in schemes on the subject. Frank's was the first
idea; and his the greatest zeal in pursuing it; for the lady was
the best judge of the difficulties, and the most solicitous for
accommodation and appearance. But still she had inclination enough
for shewing people again how delightfully Mr. Frank Churchill and
Miss Woodhouse danced—for doing that in which she need not blush to
compare herself with Jane Fairfax—and even for simple dancing
itself, without any of the wicked aids of vanity—to assist him
first in pacing out the room they were in to see what it could be
made to hold—and then in taking the dimensions of the other
parlour, in the hope of discovering, in spite of all that Mr.
Weston could say of their exactly equal size, that it was a little
the largest.

His first proposition and request, that the dance begun at Mr.
Cole's should be finished there—that the same party should be
collected, and the same musician engaged, met with the readiest
acquiescence. Mr. Weston entered into the idea with thorough
enjoyment, and Mrs. Weston most willingly undertook to play as long
as they could wish to dance; and the interesting employment had
followed, of reckoning up exactly who there would be, and
portioning out the indispensable division of space to every
couple.

"You and Miss Smith, and Miss Fairfax, will be three, and the
two Miss Coxes five," had been repeated many times over. "And there
will be the two Gilberts, young Cox, my father, and myself, besides
Mr. Knightley. Yes, that will be quite enough for pleasure. You and
Miss Smith, and Miss Fairfax, will be three, and the two Miss Coxes
five; and for five couple there will be plenty of room."

But soon it came to be on one side,

"But will there be good room for five couple?—I really do not
think there will."
