Harriet bore the intelligence very well—blaming nobody— and in
every thing testifying such an ingenuousness of disposition and
lowly opinion of herself, as must appear with particular advantage
at that moment to her friend.

Emma was in the humour to value simplicity and modesty to the
utmost; and all that was amiable, all that ought to be attaching,
seemed on Harriet's side, not her own. Harriet did not consider
herself as having any thing to complain of. The affection of such a
man as Mr. Elton would have been too great a distinction.— She
never could have deserved him—and nobody but so partial and kind a
friend as Miss Woodhouse would have thought it possible.

Her tears fell abundantly—but her grief was so truly artless,
that no dignity could have made it more respectable in Emma's eyes—
and she listened to her and tried to console her with all her heart
and understanding—really for the time convinced that Harriet was
the superior creature of the two—and that to resemble her would be
more for her own welfare and happiness than all that genius or
intelligence could do.

It was rather too late in the day to set about being
simple-minded and ignorant; but she left her with every previous
resolution confirmed of being humble and discreet, and repressing
imagination all the rest of her life. Her second duty now, inferior
only to her father's claims, was to promote Harriet's comfort, and
endeavour to prove her own affection in some better method than by
match-making. She got her to Hartfield, and shewed her the most
unvarying kindness, striving to occupy and amuse her, and by books
and conversation, to drive Mr. Elton from her thoughts.

Time, she knew, must be allowed for this being thoroughly done;
and she could suppose herself but an indifferent judge of such
matters in general, and very inadequate to sympathise in an
attachment to Mr. Elton in particular; but it seemed to her
reasonable that at Harriet's age, and with the entire extinction of
all hope, such a progress might be made towards a state of
composure by the time of Mr. Elton's return, as to allow them all
to meet again in the common routine of acquaintance, without any
danger of betraying sentiments or increasing them.

Harriet did think him all perfection, and maintained the
non-existence of any body equal to him in person or goodness—and
did, in truth, prove herself more resolutely in love than Emma had
foreseen; but yet it appeared to her so natural, so inevitable to
strive against an inclination of that sort unrequited, that she
could not comprehend its continuing very long in equal force.

If Mr. Elton, on his return, made his own indifference as
evident and indubitable as she could not doubt he would anxiously
do, she could not imagine Harriet's persisting to place her
happiness in the sight or the recollection of him.

Their being fixed, so absolutely fixed, in the same place, was
bad for each, for all three. Not one of them had the power of
removal, or of effecting any material change of society. They must
encounter each other, and make the best of it.

Harriet was farther unfortunate in the tone of her companions at
Mrs. Goddard's; Mr. Elton being the adoration of all the teachers
and great girls in the school; and it must be at Hartfield only
that she could have any chance of hearing him spoken of with
cooling moderation or repellent truth. Where the wound had been
given, there must the cure be found if anywhere; and Emma felt
that, till she saw her in the way of cure, there could be no true
peace for herself.
