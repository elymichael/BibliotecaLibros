<br/>"And no great harm if it does," said Mr. Woodhouse. "The sooner<br/>every party breaks up, the better."<br/><br/>"But you do not consider how it may appear to the Coles. Emma's<br/>going away directly after tea might be giving offence. They are<br/>good-natured people, and think little of their own claims; but<br/>still they must feel that any body's hurrying away is no great<br/>compliment; and Miss Woodhouse's doing it would be more thought of<br/>than any other person's in the room. You would not wish to<br/>disappoint and mortify the Coles, I am sure, sir; friendly, good<br/>sort of people as ever lived, and who have been your neighbours<br/>these ten years."<br/><br/>"No, upon no account in the world, Mr. Weston; I am much obliged<br/>to you for reminding me. I should be extremely sorry to be giving<br/>them any pain. I know what worthy people they are. Perry tells me<br/>that Mr. Cole never touches malt liquor. You would not think it to<br/>look at him, but he is bilious—Mr. Cole is very bilious. No, I<br/>would not be the means of giving them any pain. My dear Emma, we<br/>must consider this. I am sure, rather than run the risk of hurting<br/>Mr. and Mrs. Cole, you would stay a little longer than you might<br/>wish. You will not regard being tired. You will be perfectly safe,<br/>you know, among your friends."<br/><br/>"Oh yes, papa. I have no fears at all for myself; and I should<br/>have no scruples of staying as late as Mrs. Weston, but on your<br/>account. I am only afraid of your sitting up for me. I am not<br/>afraid of your not being exceedingly comfortable with Mrs. Goddard.<br/>She loves piquet, you know; but when she is gone home, I am afraid<br/>you will be sitting up by yourself, instead of going to bed at your<br/>usual time—and the idea of that would entirely destroy my comfort.<br/>You must promise me not to sit up."<br/><br/>He did, on the condition of some promises on her side: such as<br/>that, if she came home cold, she would be sure to warm herself<br/>thoroughly; if hungry, that she would take something to eat; that<br/>her own maid should sit up for her; and that Serle and the butler<br/>should see that every thing were safe in the house, as usual.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
