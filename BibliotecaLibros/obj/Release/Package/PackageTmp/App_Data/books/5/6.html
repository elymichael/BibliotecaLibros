<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable<br/>home and happy disposition, seemed to unite some of the best<br/>blessings of existence; and had lived nearly twenty-one years in<br/>the world with very little to distress or vex her.<br/><br/>She was the youngest of the two daughters of a most<br/>affectionate, indulgent father; and had, in consequence of her<br/>sister's marriage, been mistress of his house from a very early<br/>period. Her mother had died too long ago for her to have more than<br/>an indistinct remembrance of her caresses; and her place had been<br/>supplied by an excellent woman as governess, who had fallen little<br/>short of a mother in affection.<br/><br/>Sixteen years had Miss Taylor been in Mr. Woodhouse's family,<br/>less as a governess than a friend, very fond of both daughters, but<br/>particularly of Emma. Between them it was more the intimacy of<br/>sisters. Even before Miss Taylor had ceased to hold the nominal<br/>office of governess, the mildness of her temper had hardly allowed<br/>her to impose any restraint; and the shadow of authority being now<br/>long passed away, they had been living together as friend and<br/>friend very mutually attached, and Emma doing just what she liked;<br/>highly esteeming Miss Taylor's judgment, but directed chiefly by<br/>her own.<br/><br/>The real evils, indeed, of Emma's situation were the power of<br/>having rather too much her own way, and a disposition to think a<br/>little too well of herself; these were the disadvantages which<br/>threatened alloy to her many enjoyments. The danger, however, was<br/>at present so unperceived, that they did not by any means rank as<br/>misfortunes with her.<br/><br/>Sorrow came—a gentle sorrow—but not at all in the shape of any<br/>disagreeable consciousness.—Miss Taylor married. It was Miss<br/>Taylor's loss which first brought grief. It was on the wedding-day<br/>of this beloved friend that Emma first sat in mournful thought of<br/>any continuance. The wedding over, and the bride-people gone, her<br/>father and herself were left to dine together, with no prospect of<br/>a third to cheer a long evening. Her father composed himself to<br/>sleep after dinner, as usual, and she had then only to sit and<br/>think of what she had lost.<br/><br/>The event had every promise of happiness for her friend. Mr.<br/>Weston was a man of unexceptionable character, easy fortune,<br/>suitable age, and pleasant manners; and there was some satisfaction<br/>in considering with what self-denying, generous friendship she had<br/>always wished and promoted the match; but it was a black morning's<br/>work for her. The want of Miss Taylor would be felt every hour of<br/>every day. She recalled her past kindness—the kindness, the<br/>affection of sixteen years—how she had taught and how she had<br/>played with her from five years old—how she had devoted all her<br/>powers to attach and amuse her in health—and how nursed her through<br/>the various illnesses of childhood. A large debt of gratitude was<br/>owing here; but the intercourse of the last seven years, the equal<br/>footing and perfect unreserve which had soon followed Isabella's<br/>marriage, on their being left to each other, was yet a dearer,<br/>tenderer recollection. She had been a friend and companion such as<br/>few possessed: intelligent, well-informed, useful, gentle, knowing<br/>all the ways of the family, interested in all its concerns, and<br/>peculiarly interested in herself, in every pleasure, every scheme<br/>of hers—one to whom she could speak every thought as it arose, and<br/>who had such an affection for her as could never find fault.<br/><br/>
