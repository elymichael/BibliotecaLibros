"My dear papa, I sent the whole hind-quarter. I knew you would
wish it. There will be the leg to be salted, you know, which is so
very nice, and the loin to be dressed directly in any manner they
like."

"That's right, my dear, very right. I had not thought of it
before, but that is the best way. They must not over-salt the leg;
and then, if it is not over-salted, and if it is very thoroughly
boiled, just as Serle boils ours, and eaten very moderately of,
with a boiled turnip, and a little carrot or parsnip, I do not
consider it unwholesome."

"Emma," said Mr. Knightley presently, "I have a piece of news
for you. You like news—and I heard an article in my way hither that
I think will interest you."

"News! Oh! yes, I always like news. What is it?—why do you smile
so?—where did you hear it?—at Randalls?"

He had time only to say,

"No, not at Randalls; I have not been near Randalls," when the
door was thrown open, and Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax walked into
the room. Full of thanks, and full of news, Miss Bates knew not
which to give quickest. Mr. Knightley soon saw that he had lost his
moment, and that not another syllable of communication could rest
with him.

"Oh! my dear sir, how are you this morning? My dear Miss
Woodhouse— I come quite over-powered. Such a beautiful hind-quarter
of pork! You are too bountiful! Have you heard the news? Mr. Elton
is going to be married."

Emma had not had time even to think of Mr. Elton, and she was so
completely surprized that she could not avoid a little start, and a
little blush, at the sound.

"There is my news:—I thought it would interest you," said Mr.
Knightley, with a smile which implied a conviction of some part of
what had passed between them.

"But where could you hear it?" cried Miss Bates. "Where could
you possibly hear it, Mr. Knightley? For it is not five minutes
since I received Mrs. Cole's note—no, it cannot be more than five—
or at least ten—for I had got my bonnet and spencer on, just ready
to come out—I was only gone down to speak to Patty again about the
pork—Jane was standing in the passage—were not you, Jane?— for my
mother was so afraid that we had not any salting-pan large enough.
So I said I would go down and see, and Jane said, `Shall I go down
instead? for I think you have a little cold, and Patty has been
washing the kitchen.'—`Oh! my dear,' said I—well, and just then
came the note. A Miss Hawkins— that's all I know. A Miss Hawkins of
Bath. But, Mr. Knightley, how could you possibly have heard it? for
the very moment Mr. Cole told Mrs. Cole of it, she sat down and
wrote to me. A Miss Hawkins—"
