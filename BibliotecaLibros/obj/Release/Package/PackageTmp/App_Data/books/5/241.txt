Emma found that she must wait; and now it required little
effort. She asked no more questions therefore, merely employed her
own fancy, and that soon pointed out to her the probability of its
being some money concern—something just come to light, of a
disagreeable nature in the circumstances of the family,—something
which the late event at Richmond had brought forward. Her fancy was
very active. Half a dozen natural children, perhaps—and poor Frank
cut off!— This, though very undesirable, would be no matter of
agony to her. It inspired little more than an animating
curiosity.

"Who is that gentleman on horseback?" said she, as they
proceeded— speaking more to assist Mr. Weston in keeping his
secret, than with any other view.

"I do not know.—One of the Otways.—Not Frank;—it is not Frank, I
assure you. You will not see him. He is half way to Windsor by this
time."

"Has your son been with you, then?"

"Oh! yes—did not you know?—Well, well, never mind."

For a moment he was silent; and then added, in a tone much more
guarded and demure,

"Yes, Frank came over this morning, just to ask us how we
did."

They hurried on, and were speedily at Randalls.—"Well, my dear,"
said he, as they entered the room—"I have brought her, and now I
hope you will soon be better. I shall leave you together. There is
no use in delay. I shall not be far off, if you want me."— And Emma
distinctly heard him add, in a lower tone, before he quitted the
room,—"I have been as good as my word. She has not the least
idea."

Mrs. Weston was looking so ill, and had an air of so much
perturbation, that Emma's uneasiness increased; and the moment they
were alone, she eagerly said,

"What is it my dear friend? Something of a very unpleasant
nature, I find, has occurred;—do let me know directly what it is. I
have been walking all this way in complete suspense. We both abhor
suspense. Do not let mine continue longer. It will do you good to
speak of your distress, whatever it may be."
