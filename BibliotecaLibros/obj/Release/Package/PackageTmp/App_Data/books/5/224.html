I can never bear to<br/>think of you all there without me."<br/><br/>"These are difficulties which you must settle for yourself.<br/>Chuse your own degree of crossness. I shall press you no more."<br/><br/>The rest of the party were now returning, and all were soon<br/>collected. With some there was great joy at the sight of Frank<br/>Churchill; others took it very composedly; but there was a very<br/>general distress and disturbance on Miss Fairfax's disappearance<br/>being explained.

Frank Churchill's little inclination to<br/>exclude himself increased so much, that his last words to Emma<br/>were,<br/><br/>"Well;—if you wish me to stay and join the party, I will."<br/><br/>She smiled her acceptance; and nothing less than a summons from<br/>Richmond was to take him back before the following evening.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
