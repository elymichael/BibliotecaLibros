Emma could not forgive her;—but as neither provocation nor
resentment were discerned by Mr. Knightley, who had been of the
party, and had seen only proper attention and pleasing behaviour on
each side, he was expressing the next morning, being at Hartfield
again on business with Mr. Woodhouse, his approbation of the whole;
not so openly as he might have done had her father been out of the
room, but speaking plain enough to be very intelligible to Emma. He
had been used to think her unjust to Jane, and had now great
pleasure in marking an improvement.

"A very pleasant evening," he began, as soon as Mr. Woodhouse
had been talked into what was necessary, told that he understood,
and the papers swept away;—"particularly pleasant. You and Miss
Fairfax gave us some very good music. I do not know a more
luxurious state, sir, than sitting at one's ease to be entertained
a whole evening by two such young women; sometimes with music and
sometimes with conversation. I am sure Miss Fairfax must have found
the evening pleasant, Emma. You left nothing undone. I was glad you
made her play so much, for having no instrument at her
grandmother's, it must have been a real indulgence."

"I am happy you approved," said Emma, smiling; "but I hope I am
not often deficient in what is due to guests at Hartfield."

"No, my dear," said her father instantly; "that I am sure you
are not. There is nobody half so attentive and civil as you are. If
any thing, you are too attentive. The muffin last night—if it had
been handed round once, I think it would have been enough."

"No," said Mr. Knightley, nearly at the same time; "you are not
often deficient; not often deficient either in manner or
comprehension. I think you understand me, therefore."

An arch look expressed—"I understand you well enough;" but she
said only, "Miss Fairfax is reserved."
