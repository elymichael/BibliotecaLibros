<br/>"My father and Mrs. Weston are at the Crown at this moment,"<br/>said Frank Churchill, "examining the capabilities of the house. I<br/>left them there and came on to Hartfield, impatient for your<br/>opinion, and hoping you might be persuaded to join them and give<br/>your advice on the spot. I was desired to say so from both. It<br/>would be the greatest pleasure to them, if you could allow me to<br/>attend you there. They can do nothing satisfactorily without<br/>you."<br/><br/>Emma was most happy to be called to such a council; and her<br/>father, engaging to think it all over while she was gone, the two<br/>young people set off together without delay for the Crown. There<br/>were Mr. and Mrs. Weston; delighted to see her and receive her<br/>approbation, very busy and very happy in their different way; she,<br/>in some little distress; and he, finding every thing perfect.<br/><br/>"Emma," said she, "this paper is worse than I expected. Look! in<br/>places you see it is dreadfully dirty; and the wainscot is more<br/>yellow and forlorn than any thing I could have imagined."<br/><br/>"My dear, you are too particular," said her husband. "What does<br/>all that signify? You will see nothing of it by candlelight. It<br/>will be as clean as Randalls by candlelight. We never see any thing<br/>of it on our club-nights."<br/><br/>The ladies here probably exchanged looks which meant, "Men never<br/>know when things are dirty or not;" and the gentlemen perhaps<br/>thought each to himself, "Women will have their little nonsenses<br/>and needless cares."<br/><br/>One perplexity, however, arose, which the gentlemen did not<br/>disdain. It regarded a supper-room. At the time of the ballroom's<br/>being built, suppers had not been in question; and a small<br/>card-room adjoining, was the only addition. What was to be done?<br/>This card-room would be wanted as a card-room now; or, if cards<br/>were conveniently voted unnecessary by their four selves, still was<br/>it not too small for any comfortable supper? Another room of much<br/>better size might be secured for the purpose; but it was at the<br/>other end of the house, and a long awkward passage must be gone<br/>through to get at it. This made a difficulty. Mrs. Weston was<br/>afraid of draughts for the young people in that passage; and<br/>neither Emma nor the gentlemen could tolerate the prospect of being<br/>miserably crowded at supper.<br/><br/>Mrs. Weston proposed having no regular supper; merely<br/>sandwiches, &amp;c., set out in the little room; but that was<br/>scouted as a wretched suggestion. A private dance, without sitting<br/>down to supper, was pronounced an infamous fraud upon the rights of<br/>men and women; and Mrs. Weston must not speak of it again. She then<br/>took another line of expediency, and looking into the doubtful<br/>room, observed,<br/><br/>"I do not think it is so very small. We shall not be many, you<br/>know."<br/><br/>And Mr. Weston at the same time, walking briskly with long steps<br/>through the passage, was calling out,<br/><br/>"You talk a great deal of the length of this passage, my dear.<br/>It is a mere nothing after all; and not the least draught from the<br/>stairs."<br/><br/>
