On another,

"And after all, five couple are not enough to make it worth
while to stand up. Five couple are nothing, when one thinks
seriously about it. It will not do to invite five couple. It can be
allowable only as the thought of the moment."

Somebody said that Miss Gilbert was expected at her brother's,
and must be invited with the rest. Somebody else believed Mrs.
Gilbert would have danced the other evening, if she had been asked.
A word was put in for a second young Cox; and at last, Mr. Weston
naming one family of cousins who must be included, and another of
very old acquaintance who could not be left out, it became a
certainty that the five couple would be at least ten, and a very
interesting speculation in what possible manner they could be
disposed of.

The doors of the two rooms were just opposite each other. "Might
not they use both rooms, and dance across the passage?" It seemed
the best scheme; and yet it was not so good but that many of them
wanted a better. Emma said it would be awkward; Mrs. Weston was in
distress about the supper; and Mr. Woodhouse opposed it earnestly,
on the score of health. It made him so very unhappy, indeed, that
it could not be persevered in.

"Oh! no," said he; "it would be the extreme of imprudence. I
could not bear it for Emma!—Emma is not strong. She would catch a
dreadful cold. So would poor little Harriet. So you would all. Mrs.
Weston, you would be quite laid up; do not let them talk of such a
wild thing. Pray do not let them talk of it. That young man
(speaking lower) is very thoughtless. Do not tell his father, but
that young man is not quite the thing. He has been opening the
doors very often this evening, and keeping them open very
inconsiderately. He does not think of the draught. I do not mean to
set you against him, but indeed he is not quite the thing!"

Mrs. Weston was sorry for such a charge. She knew the importance
of it, and said every thing in her power to do it away. Every door
was now closed, the passage plan given up, and the first scheme of
dancing only in the room they were in resorted to again; and with
such good-will on Frank Churchill's part, that the space which a
quarter of an hour before had been deemed barely sufficient for
five couple, was now endeavoured to be made out quite enough for
ten.

"We were too magnificent," said he. "We allowed unnecessary
room. Ten couple may stand here very well."

Emma demurred. "It would be a crowd—a sad crowd; and what could
be worse than dancing without space to turn in?"

"Very true," he gravely replied; "it was very bad." But still he
went on measuring, and still he ended with,

"I think there will be very tolerable room for ten couple."

"No, no," said she, "you are quite unreasonable. It would be
dreadful to be standing so close! Nothing can be farther from
pleasure than to be dancing in a crowd—and a crowd in a little
room!"
