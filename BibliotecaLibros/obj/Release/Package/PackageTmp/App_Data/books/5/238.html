<br/>Emma felt that her own note had deserved something better; but<br/>it was impossible to quarrel with words, whose tremulous inequality<br/>shewed indisposition so plainly, and she thought only of how she<br/>might best counteract this unwillingness to be seen or assisted. In<br/>spite of the answer, therefore, she ordered the carriage, and drove<br/>to Mrs. Bates's, in the hope that Jane would be induced to join<br/>her— but it would not do;—Miss Bates came to the carriage door, all<br/>gratitude, and agreeing with her most earnestly in thinking an<br/>airing might be of the greatest service—and every thing that<br/>message could do was tried— but all in vain. Miss Bates was obliged<br/>to return without success; Jane was quite unpersuadable; the mere<br/>proposal of going out seemed to make her worse.—Emma wished she<br/>could have seen her, and tried her own powers; but, almost before<br/>she could hint the wish, Miss Bates made it appear that she had<br/>promised her niece on no account to let Miss Woodhouse in. "Indeed,<br/>the truth was, that poor dear Jane could not bear to see any<br/>body—any body at all— Mrs. Elton, indeed, could not be denied—and<br/>Mrs. Cole had made such a point—and Mrs. Perry had said so<br/>much—but, except them, Jane would really see nobody."<br/><br/>Emma did not want to be classed with the Mrs. Eltons, the Mrs.<br/>Perrys, and the Mrs. Coles, who would force themselves anywhere;<br/>neither could she feel any right of preference herself— she<br/>submitted, therefore, and only questioned Miss Bates farther as to<br/>her niece's appetite and diet, which she longed to be able to<br/>assist. On that subject poor Miss Bates was very unhappy, and very<br/>communicative; Jane would hardly eat any thing:— Mr. Perry<br/>recommended nourishing food; but every thing they could command<br/>(and never had any body such good neighbours) was distasteful.<br/><br/>Emma, on reaching home, called the housekeeper directly, to an<br/>examination of her stores; and some arrowroot of very superior<br/>quality was speedily despatched to Miss Bates with a most friendly<br/>note. In half an hour the arrowroot was returned, with a thousand<br/>thanks from Miss Bates, but "dear Jane would not be satisfied<br/>without its being sent back; it was a thing she could not take—and,<br/>moreover, she insisted on her saying, that she was not at all in<br/>want of any thing."<br/><br/>When Emma afterwards heard that Jane Fairfax had been seen<br/>wandering about the meadows, at some distance from Highbury, on the<br/>afternoon of the very day on which she had, under the plea of being<br/>unequal to any exercise, so peremptorily refused to go out with her<br/>in the carriage, she could have no doubt—putting every thing<br/>together— that Jane was resolved to receive no kindness from her.<br/>She was sorry, very sorry. Her heart was grieved for a state which<br/>seemed but the more pitiable from this sort of irritation of<br/>spirits, inconsistency of action, and inequality of powers; and it<br/>mortified her that she was given so little credit for proper<br/>feeling, or esteemed so little worthy as a friend: but she had the<br/>consolation of knowing that her intentions were good, and of being<br/>able to say to herself, that could Mr. Knightley have been privy to<br/>all her attempts of assisting Jane Fairfax, could he even have seen<br/>into her heart, he would not, on this occasion, have found any<br/>thing to reprove.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
