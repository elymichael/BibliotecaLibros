"Indeed! but why so?—I can hardly imagine that any thing which<br/>pleases or amuses you, should not please and amuse me too."<br/><br/>"There is one subject," he replied, "I hope but one, on which we<br/>do not think alike." He paused a moment, again smiling, with his<br/>eyes fixed on her face. "Does nothing occur to you?— Do not you<br/>recollect?—Harriet Smith."<br/><br/>Her cheeks flushed at the name, and she felt afraid of<br/>something, though she knew not what.<br/><br/>"Have you heard from her yourself this morning?" cried he. "You<br/>have, I believe, and know the whole."<br/><br/>"No, I have not; I know nothing; pray tell me."<br/><br/>"You are prepared for the worst, I see—and very bad it is.<br/>Harriet Smith marries Robert Martin."<br/><br/>Emma gave a start, which did not seem like being prepared— and<br/>her eyes, in eager gaze, said, "No, this is impossible!" but her<br/>lips were closed.<br/><br/>"It is so, indeed," continued Mr. Knightley; "I have it from<br/>Robert Martin himself. He left me not half an hour ago."<br/><br/>She was still looking at him with the most speaking<br/>amazement.<br/><br/>"You like it, my Emma, as little as I feared.—I wish our<br/>opinions were the same. But in time they will. Time, you may be<br/>sure, will make one or the other of us think differently; and, in<br/>the meanwhile, we need not talk much on the subject."<br/><br/>"You mistake me, you quite mistake me," she replied, exerting<br/>herself. "It is not that such a circumstance would now make me<br/>unhappy, but I cannot believe it. It seems an impossibility!—You<br/>cannot mean to say, that Harriet Smith has accepted Robert Martin.<br/>You cannot mean that he has even proposed to her again—yet. You<br/>only mean, that he intends it."<br/>
