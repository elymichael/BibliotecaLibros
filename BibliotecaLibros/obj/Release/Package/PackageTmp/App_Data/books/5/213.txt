"By the bye," said Frank Churchill to Mrs. Weston presently,
"what became of Mr. Perry's plan of setting up his carriage?"

Mrs. Weston looked surprized, and said, "I did not know that he
ever had any such plan."

"Nay, I had it from you. You wrote me word of it three months
ago."

"Me! impossible!"

"Indeed you did. I remember it perfectly. You mentioned it as
what was certainly to be very soon. Mrs. Perry had told somebody,
and was extremely happy about it. It was owing to her persuasion,
as she thought his being out in bad weather did him a great deal of
harm. You must remember it now?"

"Upon my word I never heard of it till this moment."

"Never! really, never!—Bless me! how could it be?—Then I must
have dreamt it—but I was completely persuaded—Miss Smith, you walk
as if you were tired. You will not be sorry to find yourself at
home."

"What is this?—What is this?" cried Mr. Weston, "about Perry and
a carriage? Is Perry going to set up his carriage, Frank? I am glad
he can afford it. You had it from himself, had you?"

"No, sir," replied his son, laughing, "I seem to have had it
from nobody.—Very odd!—I really was persuaded of Mrs. Weston's
having mentioned it in one of her letters to Enscombe, many weeks
ago, with all these particulars—but as she declares she never heard
a syllable of it before, of course it must have been a dream. I am
a great dreamer. I dream of every body at Highbury when I am away—
and when I have gone through my particular friends, then I begin
dreaming of Mr. and Mrs. Perry."

"It is odd though," observed his father, "that you should have
had such a regular connected dream about people whom it was not
very likely you should be thinking of at Enscombe. Perry's setting
up his carriage! and his wife's persuading him to it, out of care
for his health— just what will happen, I have no doubt, some time
or other; only a little premature. What an air of probability
sometimes runs through a dream! And at others, what a heap of
absurdities it is! Well, Frank, your dream certainly shews that
Highbury is in your thoughts when you are absent. Emma, you are a
great dreamer, I think?"

Emma was out of hearing. She had hurried on before her guests to
prepare her father for their appearance, and was beyond the reach
of Mr. Weston's hint.
