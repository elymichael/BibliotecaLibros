<br/>"Is Miss Woodhouse sure that she would like to hear what we are<br/>all thinking of?"<br/><br/>"Oh! no, no"—cried Emma, laughing as carelessly as she could—<br/>"Upon no account in the world. It is the very last thing I would<br/>stand the brunt of just now. Let me hear any thing rather than what<br/>you are all thinking of. I will not say quite all. There are one or<br/>two, perhaps, (glancing at Mr. Weston and Harriet,) whose thoughts<br/>I might not be afraid of knowing."<br/><br/>"It is a sort of thing," cried Mrs. Elton emphatically, "which I<br/>should not have thought myself privileged to inquire into. Though,<br/>perhaps, as the Chaperon of the party— I never was in any<br/>circle—exploring parties—young ladies—married women—"<br/><br/>Her mutterings were chiefly to her husband; and he murmured, in<br/>reply,<br/><br/>"Very true, my love, very true. Exactly so, indeed—quite unheard<br/>of— but some ladies say any thing. Better pass it off as a joke.<br/>Every body knows what is due to you."<br/><br/>"It will not do," whispered Frank to Emma; "they are most of<br/>them affronted. I will attack them with more address. Ladies and<br/>gentlemen—I am ordered by Miss Woodhouse to say, that she waives<br/>her right of knowing exactly what you may all be thinking of, and<br/>only requires something very entertaining from each of you, in a<br/>general way. Here are seven of you, besides myself, (who, she is<br/>pleased to say, am very entertaining already,) and she only demands<br/>from each of you either one thing very clever, be it prose or<br/>verse, original or repeated—or two things moderately clever— or<br/>three things very dull indeed, and she engages to laugh heartily at<br/>them all."<br/><br/>"Oh! very well," exclaimed Miss Bates, "then I need not be<br/>uneasy. `Three things very dull indeed.' That will just do for me,<br/>you know. I shall be sure to say three dull things as soon as ever<br/>I open my mouth, shan't I? (looking round with the most<br/>good-humoured dependence on every body's assent)—Do not you all<br/>think I shall?"<br/><br/>Emma could not resist.<br/><br/>"Ah! ma'am, but there may be a difficulty. Pardon me—but you<br/>will be limited as to number—only three at once."<br/><br/>Miss Bates, deceived by the mock ceremony of her manner, did not<br/>immediately catch her meaning; but, when it burst on her, it could<br/>not anger, though a slight blush shewed that it could pain her.<br/><br/>
