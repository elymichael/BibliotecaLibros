"Oh! very delightful indeed; I can say nothing less, for I
suppose Miss Woodhouse and Mr. Frank Churchill are hearing every
thing that passes. And (raising his voice still more) I do not see
why Miss Fairfax should not be mentioned too. I think Miss Fairfax
dances very well; and Mrs. Weston is the very best country-dance
player, without exception, in England. Now, if your friends have
any gratitude, they will say something pretty loud about you and me
in return; but I cannot stay to hear it."

"Oh! Mr. Knightley, one moment more; something of consequence—
so shocked!—Jane and I are both so shocked about the apples!"

"What is the matter now?"

"To think of your sending us all your store apples. You said you
had a great many, and now you have not one left. We really are so
shocked! Mrs. Hodges may well be angry. William Larkins mentioned
it here. You should not have done it, indeed you should not. Ah! he
is off. He never can bear to be thanked. But I thought he would
have staid now, and it would have been a pity not to have
mentioned… . Well, (returning to the room,) I have not been able to
succeed. Mr. Knightley cannot stop. He is going to Kingston. He
asked me if he could do any thing… ."

"Yes," said Jane, "we heard his kind offers, we heard every
thing."

"Oh! yes, my dear, I dare say you might, because you know, the
door was open, and the window was open, and Mr. Knightley spoke
loud. You must have heard every thing to be sure. `Can I do any
thing for you at Kingston?' said he; so I just mentioned… . Oh!
Miss Woodhouse, must you be going?—You seem but just come—so very
obliging of you."

Emma found it really time to be at home; the visit had already
lasted long; and on examining watches, so much of the morning was
perceived to be gone, that Mrs. Weston and her companion taking
leave also, could allow themselves only to walk with the two young
ladies to Hartfield gates, before they set off for Randalls.
