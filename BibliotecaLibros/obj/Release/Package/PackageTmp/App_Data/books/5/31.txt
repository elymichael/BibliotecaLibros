"What shall you do! In what respect? Do you mean with regard to
this letter?"

"Yes."

"But what are you in doubt of? You must answer it of course—and
speedily."

"Yes. But what shall I say? Dear Miss Woodhouse, do advise
me."

"Oh no, no! the letter had much better be all your own. You will
express yourself very properly, I am sure. There is no danger of
your not being intelligible, which is the first thing. Your meaning
must be unequivocal; no doubts or demurs: and such expressions of
gratitude and concern for the pain you are inflicting as propriety
requires, will present themselves unbidden to your mind, I am
persuaded. You need not be prompted to write with the appearance of
sorrow for his disappointment."

"You think I ought to refuse him then," said Harriet, looking
down.

"Ought to refuse him! My dear Harriet, what do you mean? Are you
in any doubt as to that? I thought—but I beg your pardon, perhaps I
have been under a mistake. I certainly have been misunderstanding
you, if you feel in doubt as to the purport of your answer. I had
imagined you were consulting me only as to the wording of it."

Harriet was silent. With a little reserve of manner, Emma
continued:

"You mean to return a favourable answer, I collect."

"No, I do not; that is, I do not mean—What shall I do? What
would you advise me to do? Pray, dear Miss Woodhouse, tell me what
I ought to do."

"I shall not give you any advice, Harriet. I will have nothing
to do with it. This is a point which you must settle with your
feelings."
