"Oh! very delightful indeed; I can say nothing less, for I<br/>suppose Miss Woodhouse and Mr. Frank Churchill are hearing every<br/>thing that passes. And (raising his voice still more) I do not see<br/>why Miss Fairfax should not be mentioned too. I think Miss Fairfax<br/>dances very well; and Mrs. Weston is the very best country-dance<br/>player, without exception, in England. Now, if your friends have<br/>any gratitude, they will say something pretty loud about you and me<br/>in return; but I cannot stay to hear it."<br/><br/>"Oh! Mr. Knightley, one moment more; something of consequence—<br/>so shocked!—Jane and I are both so shocked about the apples!"<br/><br/>"What is the matter now?"<br/><br/>"To think of your sending us all your store apples. You said you<br/>had a great many, and now you have not one left. We really are so<br/>shocked! Mrs. Hodges may well be angry. William Larkins mentioned<br/>it here. You should not have done it, indeed you should not. Ah! he<br/>is off. He never can bear to be thanked. But I thought he would<br/>have staid now, and it would have been a pity not to have<br/>mentioned… . Well, (returning to the room,) I have not been able to<br/>succeed. Mr. Knightley cannot stop. He is going to Kingston. He<br/>asked me if he could do any thing… ."<br/><br/>"Yes," said Jane, "we heard his kind offers, we heard every<br/>thing."<br/><br/>"Oh! yes, my dear, I dare say you might, because you know, the<br/>door was open, and the window was open, and Mr. Knightley spoke<br/>loud. You must have heard every thing to be sure. `Can I do any<br/>thing for you at Kingston?' said he; so I just mentioned… . Oh!<br/>Miss Woodhouse, must you be going?—You seem but just come—so very<br/>obliging of you."<br/><br/>Emma found it really time to be at home; the visit had already<br/>lasted long; and on examining watches, so much of the morning was<br/>perceived to be gone, that Mrs. Weston and her companion taking<br/>leave also, could allow themselves only to walk with the two young<br/>ladies to Hartfield gates, before they set off for Randalls.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
