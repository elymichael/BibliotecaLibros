<br/>"Indeed, I am very sorry to be right in this instance. I would<br/>much rather have been merry than wise."<br/><br/>"If I can come again, we are still to have our ball. My father<br/>depends on it. Do not forget your engagement."<br/><br/>Emma looked graciously.<br/><br/>"Such a fortnight as it has been!" he continued; "every day more<br/>precious and more delightful than the day before!—every day making<br/>me less fit to bear any other place. Happy those, who can remain at<br/>Highbury!"<br/><br/>"As you do us such ample justice now," said Emma, laughing, "I<br/>will venture to ask, whether you did not come a little doubtfully<br/>at first? Do not we rather surpass your expectations? I am sure we<br/>do. I am sure you did not much expect to like us. You would not<br/>have been so long in coming, if you had had a pleasant idea of<br/>Highbury."<br/><br/>He laughed rather consciously; and though denying the sentiment,<br/>Emma was convinced that it had been so.<br/><br/>"And you must be off this very morning?"<br/><br/>"Yes; my father is to join me here: we shall walk back together,<br/>and I must be off immediately. I am almost afraid that every moment<br/>will bring him."<br/><br/>"Not five minutes to spare even for your friends Miss Fairfax<br/>and Miss Bates? How unlucky! Miss Bates's powerful, argumentative<br/>mind might have strengthened yours."<br/><br/>"Yes—I have called there; passing the door, I thought it better.<br/>It was a right thing to do. I went in for three minutes, and was<br/>detained by Miss Bates's being absent. She was out; and I felt it<br/>impossible not to wait till she came in. She is a woman that one<br/>may, that one must laugh at; but that one would not wish to slight.<br/>It was better to pay my visit, then"—<br/><br/>
