"Well done, Mrs. Martin!" thought Emma. "You know what you are<br/>about."<br/><br/>"And when she had come away, Mrs. Martin was so very kind as to<br/>send Mrs. Goddard a beautiful goose—the finest goose Mrs. Goddard<br/>had ever seen. Mrs. Goddard had dressed it on a Sunday, and asked<br/>all the three teachers, Miss Nash, and Miss Prince, and Miss<br/>Richardson, to sup with her."<br/><br/>"Mr. Martin, I suppose, is not a man of information beyond the<br/>line of his own business? He does not read?"<br/><br/>"Oh yes!—that is, no—I do not know—but I believe he has read a<br/>good deal—but not what you would think any thing of. He reads the<br/>Agricultural Reports, and some other books that lay in one of the<br/>window seats—but he reads all them to himself. But sometimes of an<br/>evening, before we went to cards, he would read something aloud out<br/>of the Elegant Extracts, very entertaining. And I know he has read<br/>the Vicar of Wakefield. He never read the Romance of the Forest,<br/>nor The Children of the Abbey. He had never heard of such books<br/>before I mentioned them, but he is determined to get them now as<br/>soon as ever he can."<br/><br/>The next question was—<br/><br/>"What sort of looking man is Mr. Martin?"<br/><br/>"Oh! not handsome—not at all handsome. I thought him very plain<br/>at first, but I do not think him so plain now. One does not, you<br/>know, after a time. But did you never see him? He is in Highbury<br/>every now and then, and he is sure to ride through every week in<br/>his way to Kingston. He has passed you very often."<br/><br/>"That may be, and I may have seen him fifty times, but without<br/>having any idea of his name. A young farmer, whether on horseback<br/>or on foot, is the very last sort of person to raise my curiosity.<br/>The yeomanry are precisely the order of people with whom I feel I<br/>can have nothing to do. A degree or two lower, and a creditable<br/>appearance might interest me; I might hope to be useful to their<br/>families in some way or other. But a farmer can need none of my<br/>help, and is, therefore, in one sense, as much above my notice as<br/>in every other he is below it."<br/><br/>"To be sure. Oh yes! It is not likely you should ever have<br/>observed him; but he knows you very well indeed—I mean by<br/>sight."<br/><br/>"I have no doubt of his being a very respectable young man. I<br/>know, indeed, that he is so, and, as such, wish him well. What do<br/>you imagine his age to be?"<br/><br/>"He was four-and-twenty the 8th of last June, and my birthday is<br/>the 23rd just a fortnight and a day's difference—which is very<br/>odd."<br/>
