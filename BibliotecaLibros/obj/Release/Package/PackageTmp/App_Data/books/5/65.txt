Emma could not like what bordered on a reflection on Mr. Weston,
and had half a mind to take it up; but she struggled, and let it

honourable and valuable in the strong domestic habits, the
all-sufficiency of home to himself, whence resulted her brother's
disposition to look down on the common rate of social intercourse,
and those to whom it was important.â€”It had a high claim to
forbearance.
