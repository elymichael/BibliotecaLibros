<br/>The lovers were standing together at one of the windows. It had<br/>a most favourable aspect; and, for half a minute, Emma felt the<br/>glory of having schemed successfully. But it would not do; he had<br/>not come to the point. He had been most agreeable, most delightful;<br/>he had told Harriet that he had seen them go by, and had purposely<br/>followed them; other little gallantries and allusions had been<br/>dropt, but nothing serious.<br/><br/>"Cautious, very cautious," thought Emma; "he advances inch by<br/>inch, and will hazard nothing till he believes himself secure."<br/><br/>Still, however, though every thing had not been accomplished by<br/>her ingenious device, she could not but flatter herself that it had<br/>been the occasion of much present enjoyment to both, and must be<br/>leading them forward to the great event.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
