"I would ask for the pleasure of your company, Mr. Knightley,<br/>but I am a very slow walker, and my pace would be tedious to you;<br/>and, besides, you have another long walk before you, to Donwell<br/>Abbey."<br/><br/>"Thank you, sir, thank you; I am going this moment myself; and I<br/>think the sooner you go the better. I will fetch your greatcoat and<br/>open the garden door for you."<br/><br/>Mr. Woodhouse at last was off; but Mr. Knightley, instead of<br/>being immediately off likewise, sat down again, seemingly inclined<br/>for more chat. He began speaking of Harriet, and speaking of her<br/>with more voluntary praise than Emma had ever heard before.<br/><br/>"I cannot rate her beauty as you do," said he; "but she is a<br/>pretty little creature, and I am inclined to think very well of her<br/>disposition. Her character depends upon those she is with; but in<br/>good hands she will turn out a valuable woman."<br/><br/>"I am glad you think so; and the good hands, I hope, may not be<br/>wanting."<br/><br/>"Come," said he, "you are anxious for a compliment, so I will<br/>tell you that you have improved her. You have cured her of her<br/>school-girl's giggle; she really does you credit."<br/><br/>"Thank you. I should be mortified indeed if I did not believe I<br/>had been of some use; but it is not every body who will bestow<br/>praise where they may. You do not often overpower me with it."<br/><br/>"You are expecting her again, you say, this morning?"<br/><br/>"Almost every moment. She has been gone longer already than she<br/>intended."<br/><br/>"Something has happened to delay her; some visitors<br/>perhaps."<br/><br/>"Highbury gossips!â€”Tiresome wretches!"<br/>
