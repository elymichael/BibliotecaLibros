<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>7<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>They had a very fine day for Box Hill; and all the other outward<br/>circumstances of arrangement, accommodation, and punctuality, were<br/>in favour of a pleasant party. Mr. Weston directed the whole,<br/>officiating safely between Hartfield and the Vicarage, and every<br/>body was in good time. Emma and Harriet went together; Miss Bates<br/>and her niece, with the Eltons; the gentlemen on horseback. Mrs.<br/>Weston remained with Mr. Woodhouse. Nothing was wanting but to be<br/>happy when they got there. Seven miles were travelled in<br/>expectation of enjoyment, and every body had a burst of admiration<br/>on first arriving; but in the general amount of the day there was<br/>deficiency. There was a languor, a want of spirits, a want of<br/>union, which could not be got over. They separated too much into<br/>parties. The Eltons walked together; Mr. Knightley took charge of<br/>Miss Bates and Jane; and Emma and Harriet belonged to Frank<br/>Churchill. And Mr. Weston tried, in vain, to make them harmonise<br/>better. It seemed at first an accidental division, but it never<br/>materially varied. Mr. and Mrs. Elton, indeed, shewed no<br/>unwillingness to mix, and be as agreeable as they could; but during<br/>the two whole hours that were spent on the hill, there seemed a<br/>principle of separation, between the other parties, too strong for<br/>any fine prospects, or any cold collation, or any cheerful Mr.<br/>Weston, to remove.<br/><br/>At first it was downright dulness to Emma. She had never seen<br/>Frank Churchill so silent and stupid. He said nothing worth<br/>hearing— looked without seeing—admired without<br/>intelligence—listened without knowing what she said. While he was<br/>so dull, it was no wonder that Harriet should be dull likewise; and<br/>they were both insufferable.<br/><br/>When they all sat down it was better; to her taste a great deal<br/>better, for Frank Churchill grew talkative and gay, making her his<br/>first object. Every distinguishing attention that could be paid,<br/>was paid to her. To amuse her, and be agreeable in her eyes, seemed<br/>all that he cared for—and Emma, glad to be enlivened, not sorry to<br/>be flattered, was gay and easy too, and gave him all the friendly<br/>encouragement, the admission to be gallant, which she had ever<br/>given in the first and most animating period of their acquaintance;<br/>but which now, in her own estimation, meant nothing, though in the<br/>judgment of most people looking on it must have had such an<br/>appearance as no English word but flirtation could very well<br/>describe. "Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Woodhouse flirted together<br/>excessively." They were laying themselves open to that very<br/>phrase—and to having it sent off in a letter to Maple Grove by one<br/>lady, to Ireland by another. Not that Emma was gay and thoughtless<br/>from any real felicity; it was rather because she felt less happy<br/>than she had expected. She laughed because she was disappointed;<br/>and though she liked him for his attentions, and thought them all,<br/>whether in friendship, admiration, or playfulness, extremely<br/>judicious, they were not winning back her heart. She still intended<br/>him for her friend.<br/><br/>"How much I am obliged to you," said he, "for telling me to come<br/>to-day!— If it had not been for you, I should certainly have lost<br/>all the happiness of this party. I had quite determined to go away<br/>again."<br/><br/>"Yes, you were very cross; and I do not know what about, except<br/>that you were too late for the best strawberries. I was a kinder<br/>friend than you deserved. But you were humble. You begged hard to<br/>be commanded to come."<br/><br/>"Don't say I was cross. I was fatigued. The heat overcame<br/>me."<br/><br/>
