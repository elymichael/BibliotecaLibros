&#160;


Though now the middle of December, there had yet been no weather
to prevent the young ladies from tolerably regular exercise; and on
the morrow, Emma had a charitable visit to pay to a poor sick
family, who lived a little way out of Highbury.

Their road to this detached cottage was down Vicarage Lane, a
lane leading at right angles from the broad, though irregular, main
street of the place; and, as may be inferred, containing the
blessed abode of Mr. Elton. A few inferior dwellings were first to
be passed, and then, about a quarter of a mile down the lane rose
the Vicarage, an old and not very good house, almost as close to
the road as it could be. It had no advantage of situation; but had
been very much smartened up by the present proprietor; and, such as
it was, there could be no possibility of the two friends passing it
without a slackened pace and observing eyes.—Emma's remark was—

"There it is. There go you and your riddle-book one of these
days."— Harriet's was—

"Oh, what a sweet house!—How very beautiful!—There are the
yellow curtains that Miss Nash admires so much."

"I do not often walk this way now," said Emma, as they
proceeded, "but then there will be an inducement, and I shall
gradually get intimately acquainted with all the hedges, gates,
pools and pollards of this part of Highbury."

Harriet, she found, had never in her life been within side the
Vicarage, and her curiosity to see it was so extreme, that,
considering exteriors and probabilities, Emma could only class it,
as a proof of love, with Mr. Elton's seeing ready wit in her.
