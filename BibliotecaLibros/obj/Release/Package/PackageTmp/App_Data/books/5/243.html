<br/>Emma pondered a moment, and then replied, "I will not pretend<br/>not to understand you; and to give you all the relief in my power,<br/>be assured that no such effect has followed his attentions to me,<br/>as you are apprehensive of."<br/><br/>Mrs. Weston looked up, afraid to believe; but Emma's countenance<br/>was as steady as her words.<br/><br/>"That you may have less difficulty in believing this boast, of<br/>my present perfect indifference," she continued, "I will farther<br/>tell you, that there was a period in the early part of our<br/>acquaintance, when I did like him, when I was very much disposed to<br/>be attached to him—nay, was attached—and how it came to cease, is<br/>perhaps the wonder. Fortunately, however, it did cease. I have<br/>really for some time past, for at least these three months, cared<br/>nothing about him. You may believe me, Mrs. Weston. This is the<br/>simple truth."<br/><br/>Mrs. Weston kissed her with tears of joy; and when she could<br/>find utterance, assured her, that this protestation had done her<br/>more good than any thing else in the world could do.<br/><br/>"Mr. Weston will be almost as much relieved as myself," said<br/>she. "On this point we have been wretched. It was our darling wish<br/>that you might be attached to each other—and we were persuaded that<br/>it was so.— Imagine what we have been feeling on your account."<br/><br/>"I have escaped; and that I should escape, may be a matter of<br/>grateful wonder to you and myself. But this does not acquit him,<br/>Mrs. Weston; and I must say, that I think him greatly to blame.<br/>What right had he to come among us with affection and faith<br/>engaged, and with manners so very disengaged? What right had he to<br/>endeavour to please, as he certainly did—to distinguish any one<br/>young woman with persevering attention, as he certainly did—while<br/>he really belonged to another?—How could he tell what mischief he<br/>might be doing?— How could he tell that he might not be making me<br/>in love with him?— very wrong, very wrong indeed."<br/><br/>"From something that he said, my dear Emma, I rather<br/>imagine—"<br/><br/>"And how could she bear such behaviour! Composure with a<br/>witness! to look on, while repeated attentions were offering to<br/>another woman, before her face, and not resent it.—That is a degree<br/>of placidity, which I can neither comprehend nor respect."<br/><br/>"There were misunderstandings between them, Emma; he said so<br/>expressly. He had not time to enter into much explanation. He was<br/>here only a quarter of an hour, and in a state of agitation which<br/>did not allow the full use even of the time he could stay— but that<br/>there had been misunderstandings he decidedly said. The present<br/>crisis, indeed, seemed to be brought on by them; and those<br/>misunderstandings might very possibly arise from the impropriety of<br/>his conduct."<br/><br/>"Impropriety! Oh! Mrs. Weston—it is too calm a censure. Much,<br/>much beyond impropriety!—It has sunk him, I cannot say how it has<br/>sunk him in my opinion. So unlike what a man should be!— None of<br/>that upright integrity, that strict adherence to truth and<br/>principle, that disdain of trick and littleness, which a man should<br/>display in every transaction of his life."<br/><br/>
