<br/>"But you, who are so extremely fond of it—there can be no<br/>danger, surely?"<br/><br/>"I should hope not; but really when I look around among my<br/>acquaintance, I tremble. Selina has entirely given up music—never<br/>touches the instrument—though she played sweetly. And the same may<br/>be said of Mrs. Jeffereys—Clara Partridge, that was—and of the two<br/>Milmans, now Mrs. Bird and Mrs. James Cooper; and of more than I<br/>can enumerate. Upon my word it is enough to put one in a fright. I<br/>used to be quite angry with Selina; but really I begin now to<br/>comprehend that a married woman has many things to call her<br/>attention. I believe I was half an hour this morning shut up with<br/>my housekeeper."<br/><br/>"But every thing of that kind," said Emma, "will soon be in so<br/>regular a train—"<br/><br/>"Well," said Mrs. Elton, laughing, "we shall see."<br/><br/>Emma, finding her so determined upon neglecting her music, had<br/>nothing more to say; and, after a moment's pause, Mrs. Elton chose<br/>another subject.<br/><br/>"We have been calling at Randalls," said she, "and found them<br/>both at home; and very pleasant people they seem to be. I like them<br/>extremely. Mr. Weston seems an excellent creature— quite a<br/>first-rate favourite with me already, I assure you. And she appears<br/>so truly good—there is something so motherly and kind-hearted about<br/>her, that it wins upon one directly. She was your governess, I<br/>think?"<br/><br/>Emma was almost too much astonished to answer; but Mrs. Elton<br/>hardly waited for the affirmative before she went on.<br/><br/>"Having understood as much, I was rather astonished to find her<br/>so very lady-like! But she is really quite the gentlewoman."<br/><br/>"Mrs. Weston's manners," said Emma, "were always particularly<br/>good. Their propriety, simplicity, and elegance, would make them<br/>the safest model for any young woman."<br/><br/>"And who do you think came in while we were there?"<br/><br/>
