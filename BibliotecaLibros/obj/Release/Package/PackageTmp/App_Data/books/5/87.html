<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>16<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>The hair was curled, and the maid sent away, and Emma sat down<br/>to think and be miserable.—It was a wretched business indeed!—Such<br/>an overthrow of every thing she had been wishing for!—Such a<br/>development of every thing most unwelcome!—Such a blow for<br/>Harriet!—that was the worst of all. Every part of it brought pain<br/>and humiliation, of some sort or other; but, compared with the evil<br/>to Harriet, all was light; and she would gladly have submitted to<br/>feel yet more mistaken— more in error—more disgraced by<br/>mis-judgment, than she actually was, could the effects of her<br/>blunders have been confined to herself.<br/><br/>"If I had not persuaded Harriet into liking the man, I could<br/>have borne any thing. He might have doubled his presumption to me—<br/>but poor Harriet!"<br/><br/>How she could have been so deceived!—He protested that he had<br/>never thought seriously of Harriet—never! She looked back as well<br/>as she could; but it was all confusion. She had taken up the idea,<br/>she supposed, and made every thing bend to it. His manners,<br/>however, must have been unmarked, wavering, dubious, or she could<br/>not have been so misled.<br/><br/>The picture!—How eager he had been about the picture!— and the<br/>charade!—and an hundred other circumstances;— how clearly they had<br/>seemed to point at Harriet. To be sure, the charade, with its<br/>"ready wit"—but then the "soft eyes"— in fact it suited neither; it<br/>was a jumble without taste or truth. Who could have seen through<br/>such thick-headed nonsense?<br/><br/>Certainly she had often, especially of late, thought his manners<br/>to herself unnecessarily gallant; but it had passed as his way, as<br/>a mere error of judgment, of knowledge, of taste, as one proof<br/>among others that he had not always lived in the best society, that<br/>with all the gentleness of his address, true elegance was sometimes<br/>wanting; but, till this very day, she had never, for an instant,<br/>suspected it to mean any thing but grateful respect to her as<br/>Harriet's friend.<br/><br/>To Mr. John Knightley was she indebted for her first idea on the<br/>subject, for the first start of its possibility. There was no<br/>denying that those brothers had penetration. She remembered what<br/>Mr. Knightley had once said to her about Mr. Elton, the caution he<br/>had given, the conviction he had professed that Mr. Elton would<br/>never marry indiscreetly; and blushed to think how much truer a<br/>knowledge of his character had been there shewn than any she had<br/>reached herself. It was dreadfully mortifying; but Mr. Elton was<br/>proving himself, in many respects, the very reverse of what she had<br/>meant and believed him; proud, assuming, conceited; very full of<br/>his own claims, and little concerned about the feelings of<br/>others.<br/><br/>
