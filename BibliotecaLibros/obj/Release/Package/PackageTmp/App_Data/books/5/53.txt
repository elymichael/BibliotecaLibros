Kitty, a fair but frozen maid.

The name makes me think of poor Isabella; for she was very near
being christened Catherine after her grandmama. I hope we shall
have her here next week. Have you thought, my dear, where you shall
put her—and what room there will be for the children?"

"Oh! yes—she will have her own room, of course; the room she
always has;—and there is the nursery for the children,—just as
usual, you know. Why should there be any change?"

"I do not know, my dear—but it is so long since she was
here!—not since last Easter, and then only for a few days.—Mr. John
Knightley's being a lawyer is very inconvenient.—Poor Isabella!—she
is sadly taken away from us all!—and how sorry she will be when she
comes, not to see Miss Taylor here!"

"She will not be surprized, papa, at least."

"I do not know, my dear. I am sure I was very much surprized
when I first heard she was going to be married."

"We must ask Mr. and Mrs. Weston to dine with us, while Isabella
is here."

"Yes, my dear, if there is time.—But—(in a very depressed
tone)—she is coming for only one week. There will not be time for
any thing."

"It is unfortunate that they cannot stay longer—but it seems a
case of necessity. Mr. John Knightley must be in town again on the
28th, and we ought to be thankful, papa, that we are to have the
whole of the time they can give to the country, that two or three
days are not to be taken out for the Abbey. Mr. Knightley promises
to give up his claim this Christmas—though you know it is longer
since they were with him, than with us."

"It would be very hard, indeed, my dear, if poor Isabella were
to be anywhere but at Hartfield."
