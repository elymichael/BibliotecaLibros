<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>17<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>Mrs. Weston's friends were all made happy by her safety; and if<br/>the satisfaction of her well-doing could be increased to Emma, it<br/>was by knowing her to be the mother of a little girl. She had been<br/>decided in wishing for a Miss Weston. She would not acknowledge<br/>that it was with any view of making a match for her, hereafter,<br/>with either of Isabella's sons; but she was convinced that a<br/>daughter would suit both father and mother best. It would be a<br/>great comfort to Mr. Weston, as he grew older— and even Mr. Weston<br/>might be growing older ten years hence—to have his fireside<br/>enlivened by the sports and the nonsense, the freaks and the<br/>fancies of a child never banished from home; and Mrs. Weston— no<br/>one could doubt that a daughter would be most to her; and it would<br/>be quite a pity that any one who so well knew how to teach, should<br/>not have their powers in exercise again.<br/><br/>"She has had the advantage, you know, of practising on me," she<br/>continued—"like La Baronne d'Almane on La Comtesse d'Ostalis, in<br/>Madame de Genlis' Adelaide and Theodore, and we shall now see her<br/>own little Adelaide educated on a more perfect plan."<br/><br/>"That is," replied Mr. Knightley, "she will indulge her even<br/>more than she did you, and believe that she does not indulge her at<br/>all. It will be the only difference."<br/><br/>"Poor child!" cried Emma; "at that rate, what will become of<br/>her?"<br/><br/>"Nothing very bad.—The fate of thousands. She will be<br/>disagreeable in infancy, and correct herself as she grows older. I<br/>am losing all my bitterness against spoilt children, my dearest<br/>Emma. I, who am owing all my happiness to you, would not it be<br/>horrible ingratitude in me to be severe on them?"<br/><br/>Emma laughed, and replied: "But I had the assistance of all your<br/>endeavours to counteract the indulgence of other people. I doubt<br/>whether my own sense would have corrected me without it."<br/><br/>
