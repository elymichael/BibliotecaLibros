<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>18<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>"I hope I shall soon have the pleasure of introducing my son to<br/>you," said Mr. Weston.<br/><br/>Mrs. Elton, very willing to suppose a particular compliment<br/>intended her by such a hope, smiled most graciously.<br/><br/>"You have heard of a certain Frank Churchill, I presume," he<br/>continued— "and know him to be my son, though he does not bear my<br/>name."<br/><br/>"Oh! yes, and I shall be very happy in his acquaintance. I am<br/>sure Mr. Elton will lose no time in calling on him; and we shall<br/>both have great pleasure in seeing him at the Vicarage."<br/><br/>"You are very obliging.—Frank will be extremely happy, I am<br/>sure.— He is to be in town next week, if not sooner. We have notice<br/>of it in a letter to-day. I met the letters in my way this morning,<br/>and seeing my son's hand, presumed to open it—though it was not<br/>directed to me—it was to Mrs. Weston. She is his principal<br/>correspondent, I assure you. I hardly ever get a letter."<br/><br/>"And so you absolutely opened what was directed to her! Oh! Mr.<br/>Weston— (laughing affectedly) I must protest against that.—A most<br/>dangerous precedent indeed!—I beg you will not let your neighbours<br/>follow your example.—Upon my word, if this is what I am to expect,<br/>we married women must begin to exert ourselves!—Oh! Mr. Weston, I<br/>could not have believed it of you!"<br/><br/>
