<br/>"The arrival of this pianoforte is decisive with me. I wanted to<br/>know a little more, and this tells me quite enough. Depend upon it,<br/>we shall soon hear that it is a present from Mr. and Mrs.<br/>Dixon."<br/><br/>"And if the Dixons should absolutely deny all knowledge of it we<br/>must conclude it to come from the Campbells."<br/><br/>"No, I am sure it is not from the Campbells. Miss Fairfax knows<br/>it is not from the Campbells, or they would have been guessed at<br/>first. She would not have been puzzled, had she dared fix on them.<br/>I may not have convinced you perhaps, but I am perfectly convinced<br/>myself that Mr. Dixon is a principal in the business."<br/><br/>"Indeed you injure me if you suppose me unconvinced. Your<br/>reasonings carry my judgment along with them entirely. At first,<br/>while I supposed you satisfied that Colonel Campbell was the giver,<br/>I saw it only as paternal kindness, and thought it the most natural<br/>thing in the world. But when you mentioned Mrs. Dixon, I felt how<br/>much more probable that it should be the tribute of warm female<br/>friendship. And now I can see it in no other light than as an<br/>offering of love."<br/><br/>There was no occasion to press the matter farther. The<br/>conviction seemed real; he looked as if he felt it. She said no<br/>more, other subjects took their turn; and the rest of the dinner<br/>passed away; the dessert succeeded, the children came in, and were<br/>talked to and admired amid the usual rate of conversation; a few<br/>clever things said, a few downright silly, but by much the larger<br/>proportion neither the one nor the other—nothing worse than<br/>everyday remarks, dull repetitions, old news, and heavy jokes.<br/><br/>The ladies had not been long in the drawing-room, before the<br/>other ladies, in their different divisions, arrived. Emma watched<br/>the entree of her own particular little friend; and if she could<br/>not exult in her dignity and grace, she could not only love the<br/>blooming sweetness and the artless manner, but could most heartily<br/>rejoice in that light, cheerful, unsentimental disposition which<br/>allowed her so many alleviations of pleasure, in the midst of the<br/>pangs of disappointed affection. There she sat—and who would have<br/>guessed how many tears she had been lately shedding? To be in<br/>company, nicely dressed herself and seeing others nicely dressed,<br/>to sit and smile and look pretty, and say nothing, was enough for<br/>the happiness of the present hour. Jane Fairfax did look and move<br/>superior; but Emma suspected she might have been glad to change<br/>feelings with Harriet, very glad to have purchased the<br/>mortification of having loved—yes, of having loved even Mr. Elton<br/>in vain—by the surrender of all the dangerous pleasure of knowing<br/>herself beloved by the husband of her friend.<br/><br/>In so large a party it was not necessary that Emma should<br/>approach her. She did not wish to speak of the pianoforte, she felt<br/>too much in the secret herself, to think the appearance of<br/>curiosity or interest fair, and therefore purposely kept at a<br/>distance; but by the others, the subject was almost immediately<br/>introduced, and she saw the blush of consciousness with which<br/>congratulations were received, the blush of guilt which accompanied<br/>the name of "my excellent friend Colonel Campbell."<br/><br/>Mrs. Weston, kind-hearted and musical, was particularly<br/>interested by the circumstance, and Emma could not help being<br/>amused at her perseverance in dwelling on the subject; and having<br/>so much to ask and to say as to tone, touch, and pedal, totally<br/>unsuspicious of that wish of saying as little about it as possible,<br/>which she plainly read in the fair heroine's countenance.<br/><br/>They were soon joined by some of the gentlemen; and the very<br/>first of the early was Frank Churchill. In he walked, the first and<br/>the handsomest; and after paying his compliments en passant to Miss<br/>Bates and her niece, made his way directly to the opposite side of<br/>the circle, where sat Miss Woodhouse; and till he could find a seat<br/>by her, would not sit at all. Emma divined what every body present<br/>must be thinking. She was his object, and every body must perceive<br/>it. She introduced him to her friend, Miss Smith, and, at<br/>convenient moments afterwards, heard what each thought of the<br/>other. "He had never seen so lovely a face, and was delighted with<br/>her naivete." And she, "Only to be sure it was paying him too great<br/>a compliment, but she did think there were some looks a little like<br/>Mr. Elton." Emma restrained her indignation, and only turned from<br/>her in silence.<br/><br/>Smiles of intelligence passed between her and the gentleman on<br/>first glancing towards Miss Fairfax; but it was most prudent to<br/>avoid speech. He told her that he had been impatient to leave the<br/>dining-room— hated sitting long—was always the first to move when<br/>he could— that his father, Mr. Knightley, Mr. Cox, and Mr. Cole,<br/>were left very busy over parish business—that as long as he had<br/>staid, however, it had been pleasant enough, as he had found them<br/>in general a set of gentlemanlike, sensible men; and spoke so<br/>handsomely of Highbury altogether—thought it so abundant in<br/>agreeable families— that Emma began to feel she had been used to<br/>despise the place rather too much. She questioned him as to the<br/>society in Yorkshire— the extent of the neighbourhood about<br/>Enscombe, and the sort; and could make out from his answers that,<br/>as far as Enscombe was concerned, there was very little going on,<br/>that their visitings were among a range of great families, none<br/>very near; and that even when days were fixed, and invitations<br/>accepted, it was an even chance that Mrs. Churchill were not in<br/>health and spirits for going; that they made a point of visiting no<br/>fresh person; and that, though he had his separate engagements, it<br/>was not without difficulty, without considerable address at times,<br/>that he could get away, or introduce an acquaintance for a<br/>night.<br/><br/>
