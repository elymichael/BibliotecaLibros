<br/>"I had no notion that he liked me so very much," said Harriet,<br/>contemplating the letter. For a little while Emma persevered in her<br/>silence; but beginning to apprehend the bewitching flattery of that<br/>letter might be too powerful, she thought it best to say,<br/><br/>"I lay it down as a general rule, Harriet, that if a woman<br/>doubts as to whether she should accept a man or not, she certainly<br/>ought to refuse him. If she can hesitate as to `Yes,' she ought to<br/>say `No' directly. It is not a state to be safely entered into with<br/>doubtful feelings, with half a heart. I thought it my duty as a<br/>friend, and older than yourself, to say thus much to you. But do<br/>not imagine that I want to influence you."<br/><br/>"Oh! no, I am sure you are a great deal too kind to—but if you<br/>would just advise me what I had best do—No, no, I do not mean<br/>that—As you say, one's mind ought to be quite made up—One should<br/>not be hesitating—It is a very serious thing.—It will be safer to<br/>say `No,' perhaps.—Do you think I had better say `No?'"<br/><br/>"Not for the world," said Emma, smiling graciously, "would I<br/>advise you either way. You must be the best judge of your own<br/>happiness. If you prefer Mr. Martin to every other person; if you<br/>think him the most agreeable man you have ever been in company<br/>with, why should you hesitate? You blush, Harriet.—Does any body<br/>else occur to you at this moment under such a definition? Harriet,<br/>Harriet, do not deceive yourself; do not be run away with by<br/>gratitude and compassion. At this moment whom are you thinking<br/>of?"<br/><br/>The symptoms were favourable.—Instead of answering, Harriet<br/>turned away confused, and stood thoughtfully by the fire; and<br/>though the letter was still in her hand, it was now mechanically<br/>twisted about without regard. Emma waited the result with<br/>impatience, but not without strong hopes. At last, with some<br/>hesitation, Harriet said—<br/><br/>"Miss Woodhouse, as you will not give me your opinion, I must do<br/>as well as I can by myself; and I have now quite determined, and<br/>really almost made up my mind—to refuse Mr. Martin. Do you think I<br/>am right?"<br/><br/>"Perfectly, perfectly right, my dearest Harriet; you are doing<br/>just what you ought. While you were at all in suspense I kept my<br/>feelings to myself, but now that you are so completely decided I<br/>have no hesitation in approving. Dear Harriet, I give myself joy of<br/>this. It would have grieved me to lose your acquaintance, which<br/>must have been the consequence of your marrying Mr. Martin. While<br/>you were in the smallest degree wavering, I said nothing about it,<br/>because I would not influence; but it would have been the loss of a<br/>friend to me. I could not have visited Mrs. Robert Martin, of<br/>Abbey-Mill Farm. Now I am secure of you for ever."<br/><br/>Harriet had not surmised her own danger, but the idea of it<br/>struck her forcibly.<br/><br/>"You could not have visited me!" she cried, looking aghast. "No,<br/>to be sure you could not; but I never thought of that before. That<br/>would have been too dreadful!—What an escape!—Dear Miss Woodhouse,<br/>I would not give up the pleasure and honour of being intimate with<br/>you for any thing in the world."<br/><br/>"Indeed, Harriet, it would have been a severe pang to lose you;<br/>but it must have been. You would have thrown yourself out of all<br/>good society. I must have given you up."<br/><br/>
