On another,<br/><br/>"And after all, five couple are not enough to make it worth<br/>while to stand up. Five couple are nothing, when one thinks<br/>seriously about it. It will not do to invite five couple. It can be<br/>allowable only as the thought of the moment."<br/><br/>Somebody said that Miss Gilbert was expected at her brother's,<br/>and must be invited with the rest. Somebody else believed Mrs.<br/>Gilbert would have danced the other evening, if she had been asked.<br/>A word was put in for a second young Cox; and at last, Mr. Weston<br/>naming one family of cousins who must be included, and another of<br/>very old acquaintance who could not be left out, it became a<br/>certainty that the five couple would be at least ten, and a very<br/>interesting speculation in what possible manner they could be<br/>disposed of.<br/><br/>The doors of the two rooms were just opposite each other. "Might<br/>not they use both rooms, and dance across the passage?" It seemed<br/>the best scheme; and yet it was not so good but that many of them<br/>wanted a better. Emma said it would be awkward; Mrs. Weston was in<br/>distress about the supper; and Mr. Woodhouse opposed it earnestly,<br/>on the score of health. It made him so very unhappy, indeed, that<br/>it could not be persevered in.<br/><br/>"Oh! no," said he; "it would be the extreme of imprudence. I<br/>could not bear it for Emma!—Emma is not strong. She would catch a<br/>dreadful cold. So would poor little Harriet. So you would all. Mrs.<br/>Weston, you would be quite laid up; do not let them talk of such a<br/>wild thing. Pray do not let them talk of it. That young man<br/>(speaking lower) is very thoughtless. Do not tell his father, but<br/>that young man is not quite the thing. He has been opening the<br/>doors very often this evening, and keeping them open very<br/>inconsiderately. He does not think of the draught. I do not mean to<br/>set you against him, but indeed he is not quite the thing!"<br/><br/>Mrs. Weston was sorry for such a charge. She knew the importance<br/>of it, and said every thing in her power to do it away. Every door<br/>was now closed, the passage plan given up, and the first scheme of<br/>dancing only in the room they were in resorted to again; and with<br/>such good-will on Frank Churchill's part, that the space which a<br/>quarter of an hour before had been deemed barely sufficient for<br/>five couple, was now endeavoured to be made out quite enough for<br/>ten.<br/><br/>"We were too magnificent," said he. "We allowed unnecessary<br/>room. Ten couple may stand here very well."<br/><br/>Emma demurred. "It would be a crowd—a sad crowd; and what could<br/>be worse than dancing without space to turn in?"<br/><br/>"Very true," he gravely replied; "it was very bad." But still he<br/>went on measuring, and still he ended with,<br/><br/>"I think there will be very tolerable room for ten couple."<br/><br/>"No, no," said she, "you are quite unreasonable. It would be<br/>dreadful to be standing so close! Nothing can be farther from<br/>pleasure than to be dancing in a crowd—and a crowd in a little<br/>room!"<br/>
