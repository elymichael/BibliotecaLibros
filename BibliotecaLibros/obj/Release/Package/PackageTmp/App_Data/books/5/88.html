Contrary to the usual course of things, Mr. Elton's wanting to<br/>pay his addresses to her had sunk him in her opinion. His<br/>professions and his proposals did him no service. She thought<br/>nothing of his attachment, and was insulted by his hopes. He wanted<br/>to marry well, and having the arrogance to raise his eyes to her,<br/>pretended to be in love; but she was perfectly easy as to his not<br/>suffering any disappointment that need be cared for. There had been<br/>no real affection either in his language or manners. Sighs and fine<br/>words had been given in abundance; but she could hardly devise any<br/>set of expressions, or fancy any tone of voice, less allied with<br/>real love. She need not trouble herself to pity him. He only wanted<br/>to aggrandise and enrich himself; and if Miss Woodhouse of<br/>Hartfield, the heiress of thirty thousand pounds, were not quite so<br/>easily obtained as he had fancied, he would soon try for Miss<br/>Somebody else with twenty, or with ten.<br/><br/>But—that he should talk of encouragement, should consider her as<br/>aware of his views, accepting his attentions, meaning (in short),<br/>to marry him!—should suppose himself her equal in connexion or<br/>mind!—look down upon her friend, so well understanding the<br/>gradations of rank below him, and be so blind to what rose above,<br/>as to fancy himself shewing no presumption in addressing her!— It<br/>was most provoking.<br/><br/>Perhaps it was not fair to expect him to feel how very much he<br/>was her inferior in talent, and all the elegancies of mind. The<br/>very want of such equality might prevent his perception of it; but<br/>he must know that in fortune and consequence she was greatly his<br/>superior. He must know that the Woodhouses had been settled for<br/>several generations at Hartfield, the younger branch of a very<br/>ancient family—and that the Eltons were nobody. The landed property<br/>of Hartfield certainly was inconsiderable, being but a sort of<br/>notch in the Donwell Abbey estate, to which all the rest of<br/>Highbury belonged; but their fortune, from other sources, was such<br/>as to make them scarcely secondary to Donwell Abbey itself, in<br/>every other kind of consequence; and the Woodhouses had long held a<br/>high place in the consideration of the neighbourhood which Mr.<br/>Elton had first entered not two years ago, to make his way as he<br/>could, without any alliances but in trade, or any thing to<br/>recommend him to notice but his situation and his civility.— But he<br/>had fancied her in love with him; that evidently must have been his<br/>dependence; and after raving a little about the seeming incongruity<br/>of gentle manners and a conceited head, Emma was obliged in common<br/>honesty to stop and admit that her own behaviour to him had been so<br/>complaisant and obliging, so full of courtesy and attention, as<br/>(supposing her real motive unperceived) might warrant a man of<br/>ordinary observation and delicacy, like Mr. Elton, in fancying<br/>himself a very decided favourite. If she had so misinterpreted his<br/>feelings, she had little right to wonder that he, with<br/>self-interest to blind him, should have mistaken hers.<br/><br/>The first error and the worst lay at her door. It was foolish,<br/>it was wrong, to take so active a part in bringing any two people<br/>together. It was adventuring too far, assuming too much, making<br/>light of what ought to be serious, a trick of what ought to be<br/>simple. She was quite concerned and ashamed, and resolved to do<br/>such things no more.<br/><br/>"Here have I," said she, "actually talked poor Harriet into<br/>being very much attached to this man. She might never have thought<br/>of him but for me; and certainly never would have thought of him<br/>with hope, if I had not assured her of his attachment, for she is<br/>as modest and humble as I used to think him. Oh! that I had been<br/>satisfied with persuading her not to accept young Martin. There I<br/>was quite right. That was well done of me; but there I should have<br/>stopped, and left the rest to time and chance. I was introducing<br/>her into good company, and giving her the opportunity of pleasing<br/>some one worth having; I ought not to have attempted more. But now,<br/>poor girl, her peace is cut up for some time. I have been but half<br/>a friend to her; and if she were not to feel this disappointment so<br/>very much, I am sure I have not an idea of any body else who would<br/>be at all desirable for her;—William Coxe—Oh! no, I could not<br/>endure William Coxe— a pert young lawyer."<br/><br/>She stopt to blush and laugh at her own relapse, and then<br/>resumed a more serious, more dispiriting cogitation upon what had<br/>been, and might be, and must be. The distressing explanation she<br/>had to make to Harriet, and all that poor Harriet would be<br/>suffering, with the awkwardness of future meetings, the<br/>difficulties of continuing or discontinuing the acquaintance, of<br/>subduing feelings, concealing resentment, and avoiding eclat, were<br/>enough to occupy her in most unmirthful reflections some time<br/>longer, and she went to bed at last with nothing settled but the<br/>conviction of her having blundered most dreadfully.<br/><br/>To youth and natural cheerfulness like Emma's, though under<br/>temporary gloom at night, the return of day will hardly fail to<br/>bring return of spirits. The youth and cheerfulness of morning are<br/>in happy analogy, and of powerful operation; and if the distress be<br/>not poignant enough to keep the eyes unclosed, they will be sure to<br/>open to sensations of softened pain and brighter hope.<br/><br/>Emma got up on the morrow more disposed for comfort than she had<br/>gone to bed, more ready to see alleviations of the evil before her,<br/>and to depend on getting tolerably out of it.<br/><br/>It was a great consolation that Mr. Elton should not be really<br/>in love with her, or so particularly amiable as to make it shocking<br/>to disappoint him—that Harriet's nature should not be of that<br/>superior sort in which the feelings are most acute and retentive—<br/>and that there could be no necessity for any body's knowing what<br/>had passed except the three principals, and especially for her<br/>father's being given a moment's uneasiness about it.<br/><br/>These were very cheering thoughts; and the sight of a great deal<br/>of snow on the ground did her further service, for any thing was<br/>welcome that might justify their all three being quite asunder at<br/>present.<br/><br/>The weather was most favourable for her; though Christmas Day,<br/>she could not go to church. Mr. Woodhouse would have been miserable<br/>had his daughter attempted it, and she was therefore safe from<br/>either exciting or receiving unpleasant and most unsuitable ideas.<br/>The ground covered with snow, and the atmosphere in that unsettled<br/>state between frost and thaw, which is of all others the most<br/>unfriendly for exercise, every morning beginning in rain or snow,<br/>and every evening setting in to freeze, she was for many days a<br/>most honourable prisoner. No intercourse with Harriet possible but<br/>by note; no church for her on Sunday any more than on Christmas<br/>Day; and no need to find excuses for Mr. Elton's absenting<br/>himself.<br/>
