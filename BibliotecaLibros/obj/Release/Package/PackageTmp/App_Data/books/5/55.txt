"Well, I cannot understand it."

"That is the case with us all, papa. One half of the world
cannot understand the pleasures of the other."

Later in the morning, and just as the girls were going to
separate in preparation for the regular four o'clock dinner, the
hero of this inimitable charade walked in again. Harriet turned
away; but Emma could receive him with the usual smile, and her
quick eye soon discerned in his the consciousness of having made a
push—of having thrown a die; and she imagined he was come to see
how it might turn up. His ostensible reason, however, was to ask
whether Mr. Woodhouse's party could be made up in the evening
without him, or whether he should be in the smallest degree
necessary at Hartfield. If he were, every thing else must give way;
but otherwise his friend Cole had been saying so much about his
dining with him—had made such a point of it, that he had promised
him conditionally to come.

Emma thanked him, but could not allow of his disappointing his
friend on their account; her father was sure of his rubber. He
re-urged—she re-declined; and he seemed then about to make his bow,
when taking the paper from the table, she returned it—

"Oh! here is the charade you were so obliging as to leave with
us; thank you for the sight of it. We admired it so much, that I
have ventured to write it into Miss Smith's collection. Your friend
will not take it amiss I hope. Of course I have not transcribed
beyond the first eight lines."

Mr. Elton certainly did not very well know what to say. He
looked rather doubtingly—rather confused; said something about
"honour,"—glanced at Emma and at Harriet, and then seeing the book
open on the table, took it up, and examined it very attentively.
With the view of passing off an awkward moment, Emma smilingly
said,

"You must make my apologies to your friend; but so good a
charade must not be confined to one or two. He may be sure of every
woman's approbation while he writes with such gallantry."

"I have no hesitation in saying," replied Mr. Elton, though
hesitating a good deal while he spoke; "I have no hesitation in
saying—at least if my friend feels at all as I do—I have not the
smallest doubt that, could he see his little effusion honoured as I
see it, (looking at the book again, and replacing it on the table),
he would consider it as the proudest moment of his life."

After this speech he was gone as soon as possible. Emma could
not think it too soon; for with all his good and agreeable
qualities, there was a sort of parade in his speeches which was
very apt to incline her to laugh. She ran away to indulge the
inclination, leaving the tender and the sublime of pleasure to
Harriet's share.
