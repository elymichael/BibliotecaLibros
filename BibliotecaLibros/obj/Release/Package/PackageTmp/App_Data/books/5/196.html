<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>A very little quiet reflection was enough to satisfy Emma as to<br/>the nature of her agitation on hearing this news of Frank<br/>Churchill. She was soon convinced that it was not for herself she<br/>was feeling at all apprehensive or embarrassed; it was for him. Her<br/>own attachment had really subsided into a mere nothing; it was not<br/>worth thinking of;— but if he, who had undoubtedly been always so<br/>much the most in love of the two, were to be returning with the<br/>same warmth of sentiment which he had taken away, it would be very<br/>distressing. If a separation of two months should not have cooled<br/>him, there were dangers and evils before her:—caution for him and<br/>for herself would be necessary. She did not mean to have her own<br/>affections entangled again, and it would be incumbent on her to<br/>avoid any encouragement of his.<br/><br/>She wished she might be able to keep him from an absolute<br/>declaration. That would be so very painful a conclusion of their<br/>present acquaintance! and yet, she could not help rather<br/>anticipating something decisive. She felt as if the spring would<br/>not pass without bringing a crisis, an event, a something to alter<br/>her present composed and tranquil state.<br/><br/>It was not very long, though rather longer than Mr. Weston had<br/>foreseen, before she had the power of forming some opinion of Frank<br/>Churchill's feelings. The Enscombe family were not in town quite so<br/>soon as had been imagined, but he was at Highbury very soon<br/>afterwards. He rode down for a couple of hours; he could not yet do<br/>more; but as he came from Randalls immediately to Hartfield, she<br/>could then exercise all her quick observation, and speedily<br/>determine how he was influenced, and how she must act. They met<br/>with the utmost friendliness. There could be no doubt of his great<br/>pleasure in seeing her. But she had an almost instant doubt of his<br/>caring for her as he had done, of his feeling the same tenderness<br/>in the same degree. She watched him well. It was a clear thing he<br/>was less in love than he had been. Absence, with the conviction<br/>probably of her indifference, had produced this very natural and<br/>very desirable effect.<br/><br/>He was in high spirits; as ready to talk and laugh as ever, and<br/>seemed delighted to speak of his former visit, and recur to old<br/>stories: and he was not without agitation. It was not in his<br/>calmness that she read his comparative difference. He was not calm;<br/>his spirits were evidently fluttered; there was restlessness about<br/>him. Lively as he was, it seemed a liveliness that did not satisfy<br/>himself; but what decided her belief on the subject, was his<br/>staying only a quarter of an hour, and hurrying away to make other<br/>calls in Highbury. "He had seen a group of old acquaintance in the<br/>street as he passed— he had not stopped, he would not stop for more<br/>than a word—but he had the vanity to think they would be<br/>disappointed if he did not call, and much as he wished to stay<br/>longer at Hartfield, he must hurry off." She had no doubt as to his<br/>being less in love—but neither his agitated spirits, nor his<br/>hurrying away, seemed like a perfect cure; and she was rather<br/>inclined to think it implied a dread of her returning power, and a<br/>discreet resolution of not trusting himself with her long.<br/><br/>This was the only visit from Frank Churchill in the course of<br/>ten days. He was often hoping, intending to come—but was always<br/>prevented. His aunt could not bear to have him leave her. Such was<br/>his own account at Randall's. If he were quite sincere, if he<br/>really tried to come, it was to be inferred that Mrs. Churchill's<br/>removal to London had been of no service to the wilful or nervous<br/>part of her disorder. That she was really ill was very certain; he<br/>had declared himself convinced of it, at Randalls. Though much<br/>might be fancy, he could not doubt, when he looked back, that she<br/>was in a weaker state of health than she had been half a year ago.<br/>He did not believe it to proceed from any thing that care and<br/>medicine might not remove, or at least that she might not have many<br/>years of existence before her; but he could not be prevailed on, by<br/>all his father's doubts, to say that her complaints were merely<br/>imaginary, or that she was as strong as ever.<br/><br/>It soon appeared that London was not the place for her. She<br/>could not endure its noise. Her nerves were under continual<br/>irritation and suffering; and by the ten days' end, her nephew's<br/>letter to Randalls communicated a change of plan. They were going<br/>to remove immediately to Richmond. Mrs. Churchill had been<br/>recommended to the medical skill of an eminent person there, and<br/>had otherwise a fancy for the place. A ready-furnished house in a<br/>favourite spot was engaged, and much benefit expected from the<br/>change.<br/><br/>
