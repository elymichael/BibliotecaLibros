"I do not know why you should say so. He wishes exceedingly to<br/>come; but his uncle and aunt will not spare him."<br/><br/>"I cannot believe that he has not the power of coming, if he<br/>made a point of it. It is too unlikely, for me to believe it<br/>without proof."<br/><br/>"How odd you are! What has Mr. Frank Churchill done, to make you<br/>suppose him such an unnatural creature?"<br/><br/>"I am not supposing him at all an unnatural creature, in<br/>suspecting that he may have learnt to be above his connexions, and<br/>to care very little for any thing but his own pleasure, from living<br/>with those who have always set him the example of it. It is a great<br/>deal more natural than one could wish, that a young man, brought up<br/>by those who are proud, luxurious, and selfish, should be proud,<br/>luxurious, and selfish too. If Frank Churchill had wanted to see<br/>his father, he would have contrived it between September and<br/>January. A man at his age—what is he?—three or<br/>four-and-twenty—cannot be without the means of doing as much as<br/>that. It is impossible."<br/><br/>"That's easily said, and easily felt by you, who have always<br/>been your own master. You are the worst judge in the world, Mr.<br/>Knightley, of the difficulties of dependence. You do not know what<br/>it is to have tempers to manage."<br/><br/>"It is not to be conceived that a man of three or<br/>four-and-twenty should not have liberty of mind or limb to that<br/>amount. He cannot want money—he cannot want leisure. We know, on<br/>the contrary, that he has so much of both, that he is glad to get<br/>rid of them at the idlest haunts in the kingdom. We hear of him for<br/>ever at some watering-place or other. A little while ago, he was at<br/>Weymouth. This proves that he can leave the Churchills."<br/><br/>"Yes, sometimes he can."<br/><br/>"And those times are whenever he thinks it worth his while;<br/>whenever there is any temptation of pleasure."<br/><br/>"It is very unfair to judge of any body's conduct, without an<br/>intimate knowledge of their situation. Nobody, who has not been in<br/>the interior of a family, can say what the difficulties of any<br/>individual of that family may be. We ought to be acquainted with<br/>Enscombe, and with Mrs. Churchill's temper, before we pretend to<br/>decide upon what her nephew can do. He may, at times, be able to do<br/>a great deal more than he can at others."<br/><br/>"There is one thing, Emma, which a man can always do, if he<br/>chuses, and that is, his duty; not by manoeuvring and finessing,<br/>but by vigour and resolution. It is Frank Churchill's duty to pay<br/>this attention to his father. He knows it to be so, by his promises<br/>and messages; but if he wished to do it, it might be done. A man<br/>who felt rightly would say at once, simply and resolutely, to Mrs.<br/>Churchill— `Every sacrifice of mere pleasure you will always find<br/>me ready to make to your convenience; but I must go and see my<br/>father immediately. I know he would be hurt by my failing in such a<br/>mark of respect to him on the present occasion. I shall, therefore,<br/>set off to-morrow.'— If he would say so to her at once, in the tone<br/>of decision becoming a man, there would be no opposition made to<br/>his going."<br/><br/>"No," said Emma, laughing; "but perhaps there might be some made<br/>to his coming back again. Such language for a young man entirely<br/>dependent, to use!—Nobody but you, Mr. Knightley, would imagine it<br/>possible. But you have not an idea of what is requisite in<br/>situations directly opposite to your own. Mr. Frank Churchill to be<br/>making such a speech as that to the uncle and aunt, who have<br/>brought him up, and are to provide for him!—Standing up in the<br/>middle of the room, I suppose, and speaking as loud as he<br/>could!—How can you imagine such conduct practicable?"<br/>
