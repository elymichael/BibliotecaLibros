<br/>"Oh!"<br/><br/>"They talked a great deal about him, especially Anne Cox. I do<br/>not know what she meant, but she asked me if I thought I should go<br/>and stay there again next summer."<br/><br/>"She meant to be impertinently curious, just as such an Anne Cox<br/>should be."<br/><br/>"She said he was very agreeable the day he dined there. He sat<br/>by her at dinner. Miss Nash thinks either of the Coxes would be<br/>very glad to marry him."<br/><br/>"Very likely.—I think they are, without exception, the most<br/>vulgar girls in Highbury."<br/><br/>Harriet had business at Ford's.—Emma thought it most prudent to<br/>go with her. Another accidental meeting with the Martins was<br/>possible, and in her present state, would be dangerous.<br/><br/>Harriet, tempted by every thing and swayed by half a word, was<br/>always very long at a purchase; and while she was still hanging<br/>over muslins and changing her mind, Emma went to the door for<br/>amusement.—Much could not be hoped from the traffic of even the<br/>busiest part of Highbury;— Mr. Perry walking hastily by, Mr.<br/>William Cox letting himself in at the office-door, Mr. Cole's<br/>carriage-horses returning from exercise, or a stray letter-boy on<br/>an obstinate mule, were the liveliest objects she could presume to<br/>expect; and when her eyes fell only on the butcher with his tray, a<br/>tidy old woman travelling homewards from shop with her full basket,<br/>two curs quarrelling over a dirty bone, and a string of dawdling<br/>children round the baker's little bow-window eyeing the<br/>gingerbread, she knew she had no reason to complain, and was amused<br/>enough; quite enough still to stand at the door. A mind lively and<br/>at ease, can do with seeing nothing, and can see nothing that does<br/>not answer.<br/><br/>She looked down the Randalls road. The scene enlarged; two<br/>persons appeared; Mrs. Weston and her son-in-law; they were walking<br/>into Highbury;—to Hartfield of course. They were stopping, however,<br/>in the first place at Mrs. Bates's; whose house was a little nearer<br/>Randalls than Ford's; and had all but knocked, when Emma caught<br/>their eye.—Immediately they crossed the road and came forward to<br/>her; and the agreeableness of yesterday's engagement seemed to give<br/>fresh pleasure to the present meeting. Mrs. Weston informed her<br/>that she was going to call on the Bateses, in order to hear the new<br/>instrument.<br/><br/>"For my companion tells me," said she, "that I absolutely<br/>promised Miss Bates last night, that I would come this morning. I<br/>was not aware of it myself. I did not know that I had fixed a day,<br/>but as he says I did, I am going now."<br/><br/>"And while Mrs. Weston pays her visit, I may be allowed, I<br/>hope," said Frank Churchill, "to join your party and wait for her<br/>at Hartfield— if you are going home."<br/><br/>
