Mrs. Elton was spoken of. "I think she must be here soon," said
he. "I have a great curiosity to see Mrs. Elton, I have heard so
much of her. It cannot be long, I think, before she comes."

A carriage was heard. He was on the move immediately; but coming
back, said,

"I am forgetting that I am not acquainted with her. I have never
seen either Mr. or Mrs. Elton. I have no business to put myself
forward."

Mr. and Mrs. Elton appeared; and all the smiles and the
proprieties passed.

"But Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax!" said Mr. Weston, looking
about. "We thought you were to bring them."

The mistake had been slight. The carriage was sent for them now.
Emma longed to know what Frank's first opinion of Mrs. Elton might
be; how he was affected by the studied elegance of her dress, and
her smiles of graciousness. He was immediately qualifying himself
to form an opinion, by giving her very proper attention, after the
introduction had passed.

In a few minutes the carriage returned.—Somebody talked of
rain.— "I will see that there are umbrellas, sir," said Frank to
his father: "Miss Bates must not be forgotten:" and away he went.
Mr. Weston was following; but Mrs. Elton detained him, to gratify
him by her opinion of his son; and so briskly did she begin, that
the young man himself, though by no means moving slowly, could
hardly be out of hearing.

"A very fine young man indeed, Mr. Weston. You know I candidly
told you I should form my own opinion; and I am happy to say that I
am extremely pleased with him.—You may believe me. I never
compliment. I think him a very handsome young man, and his manners
are precisely what I like and approve—so truly the gentleman,
without the least conceit or puppyism. You must know I have a vast
dislike to puppies— quite a horror of them. They were never
tolerated at Maple Grove. Neither Mr. Suckling nor me had ever any
patience with them; and we used sometimes to say very cutting
things! Selina, who is mild almost to a fault, bore with them much
better."

While she talked of his son, Mr. Weston's attention was chained;
but when she got to Maple Grove, he could recollect that there were
ladies just arriving to be attended to, and with happy smiles must
hurry away.

Mrs. Elton turned to Mrs. Weston. "I have no doubt of its being
our carriage with Miss Bates and Jane. Our coachman and horses are
so extremely expeditious!—I believe we drive faster than any body.—
What a pleasure it is to send one's carriage for a friend!— I
understand you were so kind as to offer, but another time it will
be quite unnecessary. You may be very sure I shall always take care
of them."

Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax, escorted by the two gentlemen,
walked into the room; and Mrs. Elton seemed to think it as much her
duty as Mrs. Weston's to receive them. Her gestures and movements
might be understood by any one who looked on like Emma; but her
words, every body's words, were soon lost under the incessant flow
of Miss Bates, who came in talking, and had not finished her speech
under many minutes after her being admitted into the circle at the
fire. As the door opened she was heard,
