"I would ask for the pleasure of your company, Mr. Knightley,
but I am a very slow walker, and my pace would be tedious to you;
and, besides, you have another long walk before you, to Donwell
Abbey."

"Thank you, sir, thank you; I am going this moment myself; and I
think the sooner you go the better. I will fetch your greatcoat and
open the garden door for you."

Mr. Woodhouse at last was off; but Mr. Knightley, instead of
being immediately off likewise, sat down again, seemingly inclined
for more chat. He began speaking of Harriet, and speaking of her
with more voluntary praise than Emma had ever heard before.

"I cannot rate her beauty as you do," said he; "but she is a
pretty little creature, and I am inclined to think very well of her
disposition. Her character depends upon those she is with; but in
good hands she will turn out a valuable woman."

"I am glad you think so; and the good hands, I hope, may not be
wanting."

"Come," said he, "you are anxious for a compliment, so I will
tell you that you have improved her. You have cured her of her
school-girl's giggle; she really does you credit."

"Thank you. I should be mortified indeed if I did not believe I
had been of some use; but it is not every body who will bestow
praise where they may. You do not often overpower me with it."

"You are expecting her again, you say, this morning?"

"Almost every moment. She has been gone longer already than she
intended."

"Something has happened to delay her; some visitors
perhaps."

"Highbury gossips!â€”Tiresome wretches!"
