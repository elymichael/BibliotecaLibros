<br/>"Depend upon it, Emma, a sensible man would find no difficulty<br/>in it. He would feel himself in the right; and the<br/>declaration—made, of course, as a man of sense would make it, in a<br/>proper manner— would do him more good, raise him higher, fix his<br/>interest stronger with the people he depended on, than all that a<br/>line of shifts and expedients can ever do. Respect would be added<br/>to affection. They would feel that they could trust him; that the<br/>nephew who had done rightly by his father, would do rightly by<br/>them; for they know, as well as he does, as well as all the world<br/>must know, that he ought to pay this visit to his father; and while<br/>meanly exerting their power to delay it, are in their hearts not<br/>thinking the better of him for submitting to their whims. Respect<br/>for right conduct is felt by every body. If he would act in this<br/>sort of manner, on principle, consistently, regularly, their little<br/>minds would bend to his."<br/><br/>"I rather doubt that. You are very fond of bending little minds;<br/>but where little minds belong to rich people in authority, I think<br/>they have a knack of swelling out, till they are quite as<br/>unmanageable as great ones. I can imagine, that if you, as you are,<br/>Mr. Knightley, were to be transported and placed all at once in Mr.<br/>Frank Churchill's situation, you would be able to say and do just<br/>what you have been recommending for him; and it might have a very<br/>good effect. The Churchills might not have a word to say in return;<br/>but then, you would have no habits of early obedience and long<br/>observance to break through. To him who has, it might not be so<br/>easy to burst forth at once into perfect independence, and set all<br/>their claims on his gratitude and regard at nought. He may have as<br/>strong a sense of what would be right, as you can have, without<br/>being so equal, under particular circumstances, to act up to<br/>it."<br/><br/>"Then it would not be so strong a sense. If it failed to produce<br/>equal exertion, it could not be an equal conviction."<br/><br/>"Oh, the difference of situation and habit! I wish you would try<br/>to understand what an amiable young man may be likely to feel in<br/>directly opposing those, whom as child and boy he has been looking<br/>up to all his life."<br/><br/>"Our amiable young man is a very weak young man, if this be the<br/>first occasion of his carrying through a resolution to do right<br/>against the will of others. It ought to have been a habit with him<br/>by this time, of following his duty, instead of consulting<br/>expediency. I can allow for the fears of the child, but not of the<br/>man. As he became rational, he ought to have roused himself and<br/>shaken off all that was unworthy in their authority. He ought to<br/>have opposed the first attempt on their side to make him slight his<br/>father. Had he begun as he ought, there would have been no<br/>difficulty now."<br/><br/>"We shall never agree about him," cried Emma; "but that is<br/>nothing extraordinary. I have not the least idea of his being a<br/>weak young man: I feel sure that he is not. Mr. Weston would not be<br/>blind to folly, though in his own son; but he is very likely to<br/>have a more yielding, complying, mild disposition than would suit<br/>your notions of man's perfection. I dare say he has; and though it<br/>may cut him off from some advantages, it will secure him many<br/>others."<br/><br/>"Yes; all the advantages of sitting still when he ought to move,<br/>and of leading a life of mere idle pleasure, and fancying himself<br/>extremely expert in finding excuses for it. He can sit down and<br/>write a fine flourishing letter, full of professions and<br/>falsehoods, and persuade himself that he has hit upon the very best<br/>method in the world of preserving peace at home and preventing his<br/>father's having any right to complain. His letters disgust me."<br/><br/>"Your feelings are singular. They seem to satisfy every body<br/>else."<br/><br/>"I suspect they do not satisfy Mrs. Weston. They hardly can<br/>satisfy a woman of her good sense and quick feelings: standing in a<br/>mother's place, but without a mother's affection to blind her. It<br/>is on her account that attention to Randalls is doubly due, and she<br/>must doubly feel the omission. Had she been a person of consequence<br/>herself, he would have come I dare say; and it would not have<br/>signified whether he did or no. Can you think your friend<br/>behindhand in these sort of considerations? Do you suppose she does<br/>not often say all this to herself? No, Emma, your amiable young man<br/>can be amiable only in French, not in English. He may be very<br/>`aimable,' have very good manners, and be very agreeable; but he<br/>can have no English delicacy towards the feelings of other people:<br/>nothing really amiable about him."<br/><br/>"You seem determined to think ill of him."<br/><br/>
