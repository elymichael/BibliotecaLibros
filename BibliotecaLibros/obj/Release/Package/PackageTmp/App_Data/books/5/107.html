<br/>"My dear papa, I sent the whole hind-quarter. I knew you would<br/>wish it. There will be the leg to be salted, you know, which is so<br/>very nice, and the loin to be dressed directly in any manner they<br/>like."<br/><br/>"That's right, my dear, very right. I had not thought of it<br/>before, but that is the best way. They must not over-salt the leg;<br/>and then, if it is not over-salted, and if it is very thoroughly<br/>boiled, just as Serle boils ours, and eaten very moderately of,<br/>with a boiled turnip, and a little carrot or parsnip, I do not<br/>consider it unwholesome."<br/><br/>"Emma," said Mr. Knightley presently, "I have a piece of news<br/>for you. You like news—and I heard an article in my way hither that<br/>I think will interest you."<br/><br/>"News! Oh! yes, I always like news. What is it?—why do you smile<br/>so?—where did you hear it?—at Randalls?"<br/><br/>He had time only to say,<br/><br/>"No, not at Randalls; I have not been near Randalls," when the<br/>door was thrown open, and Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax walked into<br/>the room. Full of thanks, and full of news, Miss Bates knew not<br/>which to give quickest. Mr. Knightley soon saw that he had lost his<br/>moment, and that not another syllable of communication could rest<br/>with him.<br/><br/>"Oh! my dear sir, how are you this morning? My dear Miss<br/>Woodhouse— I come quite over-powered. Such a beautiful hind-quarter<br/>of pork! You are too bountiful! Have you heard the news? Mr. Elton<br/>is going to be married."<br/><br/>Emma had not had time even to think of Mr. Elton, and she was so<br/>completely surprized that she could not avoid a little start, and a<br/>little blush, at the sound.<br/><br/>"There is my news:—I thought it would interest you," said Mr.<br/>Knightley, with a smile which implied a conviction of some part of<br/>what had passed between them.<br/><br/>"But where could you hear it?" cried Miss Bates. "Where could<br/>you possibly hear it, Mr. Knightley? For it is not five minutes<br/>since I received Mrs. Cole's note—no, it cannot be more than five—<br/>or at least ten—for I had got my bonnet and spencer on, just ready<br/>to come out—I was only gone down to speak to Patty again about the<br/>pork—Jane was standing in the passage—were not you, Jane?— for my<br/>mother was so afraid that we had not any salting-pan large enough.<br/>So I said I would go down and see, and Jane said, `Shall I go down<br/>instead? for I think you have a little cold, and Patty has been<br/>washing the kitchen.'—`Oh! my dear,' said I—well, and just then<br/>came the note. A Miss Hawkins— that's all I know. A Miss Hawkins of<br/>Bath. But, Mr. Knightley, how could you possibly have heard it? for<br/>the very moment Mr. Cole told Mrs. Cole of it, she sat down and<br/>wrote to me. A Miss Hawkins—"<br/><br/>
