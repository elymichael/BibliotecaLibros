Emma was quite at a loss. The tone implied some old<br/>acquaintance— and how could she possibly guess?<br/><br/>"Knightley!" continued Mrs. Elton; "Knightley himself!—Was not<br/>it lucky?—for, not being within when he called the other day, I had<br/>never seen him before; and of course, as so particular a friend of<br/>Mr. E.'s, I had a great curiosity. `My friend Knightley' had been<br/>so often mentioned, that I was really impatient to see him; and I<br/>must do my caro sposo the justice to say that he need not be<br/>ashamed of his friend. Knightley is quite the gentleman. I like him<br/>very much. Decidedly, I think, a very gentleman-like man."<br/><br/>Happily, it was now time to be gone. They were off; and Emma<br/>could breathe.<br/><br/>"Insufferable woman!" was her immediate exclamation. "Worse than<br/>I had supposed. Absolutely insufferable! Knightley!—I could not<br/>have believed it. Knightley!—never seen him in her life before, and<br/>call him Knightley!—and discover that he is a gentleman! A little<br/>upstart, vulgar being, with her Mr. E., and her caro sposo, and her<br/>resources, and all her airs of pert pretension and underbred<br/>finery. Actually to discover that Mr. Knightley is a gentleman! I<br/>doubt whether he will return the compliment, and discover her to be<br/>a lady. I could not have believed it! And to propose that she and I<br/>should unite to form a musical club! One would fancy we were bosom<br/>friends! And Mrs. Weston!— Astonished that the person who had<br/>brought me up should be a gentlewoman! Worse and worse. I never met<br/>with her equal. Much beyond my hopes. Harriet is disgraced by any<br/>comparison. Oh! what would Frank Churchill say to her, if he were<br/>here? How angry and how diverted he would be! Ah! there I am—<br/>thinking of him directly. Always the first person to be thought of!<br/>How I catch myself out! Frank Churchill comes as regularly into my<br/>mind!"—<br/><br/>All this ran so glibly through her thoughts, that by the time<br/>her father had arranged himself, after the bustle of the Eltons'<br/>departure, and was ready to speak, she was very tolerably capable<br/>of attending.<br/><br/>"Well, my dear," he deliberately began, "considering we never<br/>saw her before, she seems a very pretty sort of young lady; and I<br/>dare say she was very much pleased with you. She speaks a little<br/>too quick. A little quickness of voice there is which rather hurts<br/>the ear. But I believe I am nice; I do not like strange voices; and<br/>nobody speaks like you and poor Miss Taylor. However, she seems a<br/>very obliging, pretty-behaved young lady, and no doubt will make<br/>him a very good wife. Though I think he had better not have<br/>married. I made the best excuses I could for not having been able<br/>to wait on him and Mrs. Elton on this happy occasion; I said that I<br/>hoped I should in the course of the summer. But I ought to have<br/>gone before. Not to wait upon a bride is very remiss. Ah! it shews<br/>what a sad invalid I am! But I do not like the corner into Vicarage<br/>Lane."<br/><br/>"I dare say your apologies were accepted, sir. Mr. Elton knows<br/>you."<br/><br/>"Yes: but a young lady—a bride—I ought to have paid my respects<br/>to her if possible. It was being very deficient."<br/><br/>"But, my dear papa, you are no friend to matrimony; and<br/>therefore why should you be so anxious to pay your respects to a<br/>bride? It ought to be no recommendation to you. It is encouraging<br/>people to marry if you make so much of them."<br/><br/>"No, my dear, I never encouraged any body to marry, but I would<br/>always wish to pay every proper attention to a lady—and a bride,<br/>especially, is never to be neglected. More is avowedly due to her.<br/>A bride, you know, my dear, is always the first in company, let the<br/>others be who they may."<br/><br/>"Well, papa, if this is not encouragement to marry, I do not<br/>know what is. And I should never have expected you to be lending<br/>your sanction to such vanity-baits for poor young ladies."<br/>
