"Yes," said Mr. John Knightley presently, with some slyness, "he
seems to have a great deal of good-will towards you."

"Me!" she replied with a smile of astonishment, "are you
imagining me to be Mr. Elton's object?"

"Such an imagination has crossed me, I own, Emma; and if it
never occurred to you before, you may as well take it into
consideration now."

"Mr. Elton in love with me!—What an idea!"

"I do not say it is so; but you will do well to consider whether
it is so or not, and to regulate your behaviour accordingly. I
think your manners to him encouraging. I speak as a friend, Emma.
You had better look about you, and ascertain what you do, and what
you mean to do."

"I thank you; but I assure you you are quite mistaken. Mr. Elton
and I are very good friends, and nothing more;" and she walked on,
amusing herself in the consideration of the blunders which often
arise from a partial knowledge of circumstances, of the mistakes
which people of high pretensions to judgment are for ever falling
into; and not very well pleased with her brother for imagining her
blind and ignorant, and in want of counsel. He said no more.

Mr. Woodhouse had so completely made up his mind to the visit,
that in spite of the increasing coldness, he seemed to have no idea
of shrinking from it, and set forward at last most punctually with
his eldest daughter in his own carriage, with less apparent
consciousness of the weather than either of the others; too full of
the wonder of his own going, and the pleasure it was to afford at
Randalls to see that it was cold, and too well wrapt up to feel it.
The cold, however, was severe; and by the time the second carriage
was in motion, a few flakes of snow were finding their way down,
and the sky had the appearance of being so overcharged as to want
only a milder air to produce a very white world in a very short
time.

Emma soon saw that her companion was not in the happiest humour.
The preparing and the going abroad in such weather, with the
sacrifice of his children after dinner, were evils, were
disagreeables at least, which Mr. John Knightley did not by any
means like; he anticipated nothing in the visit that could be at
all worth the purchase; and the whole of their drive to the
vicarage was spent by him in expressing his discontent.

"A man," said he, "must have a very good opinion of himself when
he asks people to leave their own fireside, and encounter such a
day as this, for the sake of coming to see him. He must think
himself a most agreeable fellow; I could not do such a thing. It is
the greatest absurdity—Actually snowing at this moment!— The folly
of not allowing people to be comfortable at home—and the folly of
people's not staying comfortably at home when they can! If we were
obliged to go out such an evening as this, by any call of duty or
business, what a hardship we should deem it;—and here are we,
probably with rather thinner clothing than usual, setting forward
voluntarily, without excuse, in defiance of the voice of nature,
which tells man, in every thing given to his view or his feelings,
to stay at home himself, and keep all under shelter that he can;—
here are we setting forward to spend five dull hours in another
man's house, with nothing to say or to hear that was not said and
heard yesterday, and may not be said and heard again to-morrow.
Going in dismal weather, to return probably in worse;—four horses
and four servants taken out for nothing but to convey five idle,
shivering creatures into colder rooms and worse company than they
might have had at home."

Emma did not find herself equal to give the pleased assent,
which no doubt he was in the habit of receiving, to emulate the
"Very true, my love," which must have been usually administered by
his travelling companion; but she had resolution enough to refrain
from making any answer at all. She could not be complying, she
dreaded being quarrelsome; her heroism reached only to silence. She
allowed him to talk, and arranged the glasses, and wrapped herself
up, without opening her lips.
