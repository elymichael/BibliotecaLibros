<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>9<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>Emma's pensive meditations, as she walked home, were not<br/>interrupted; but on entering the parlour, she found those who must<br/>rouse her. Mr. Knightley and Harriet had arrived during her<br/>absence, and were sitting with her father.—Mr. Knightley<br/>immediately got up, and in a manner decidedly graver than usual,<br/>said,<br/><br/>"I would not go away without seeing you, but I have no time to<br/>spare, and therefore must now be gone directly. I am going to<br/>London, to spend a few days with John and Isabella. Have you any<br/>thing to send or say, besides the `love,' which nobody<br/>carries?"<br/><br/>"Nothing at all. But is not this a sudden scheme?"<br/><br/>"Yes—rather—I have been thinking of it some little time."<br/><br/>Emma was sure he had not forgiven her; he looked unlike himself.<br/>Time, however, she thought, would tell him that they ought to be<br/>friends again. While he stood, as if meaning to go, but not going—<br/>her father began his inquiries.<br/><br/>"Well, my dear, and did you get there safely?—And how did you<br/>find my worthy old friend and her daughter?—I dare say they must<br/>have been very much obliged to you for coming. Dear Emma has been<br/>to call on Mrs. and Miss Bates, Mr. Knightley, as I told you<br/>before. She is always so attentive to them!"<br/><br/>
