<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>12<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>Till now that she was threatened with its loss, Emma had never<br/>known how much of her happiness depended on being first with Mr.<br/>Knightley, first in interest and affection.—Satisfied that it was<br/>so, and feeling it her due, she had enjoyed it without reflection;<br/>and only in the dread of being supplanted, found how inexpressibly<br/>important it had been.—Long, very long, she felt she had been<br/>first; for, having no female connexions of his own, there had been<br/>only Isabella whose claims could be compared with hers, and she had<br/>always known exactly how far he loved and esteemed Isabella. She<br/>had herself been first with him for many years past. She had not<br/>deserved it; she had often been negligent or perverse, slighting<br/>his advice, or even wilfully opposing him, insensible of half his<br/>merits, and quarrelling with him because he would not acknowledge<br/>her false and insolent estimate of her own—but still, from family<br/>attachment and habit, and thorough excellence of mind, he had loved<br/>her, and watched over her from a girl, with an endeavour to improve<br/>her, and an anxiety for her doing right, which no other creature<br/>had at all shared. In spite of all her faults, she knew she was<br/>dear to him; might she not say, very dear?— When the suggestions of<br/>hope, however, which must follow here, presented themselves, she<br/>could not presume to indulge them. Harriet Smith might think<br/>herself not unworthy of being peculiarly, exclusively, passionately<br/>loved by Mr. Knightley. She could not. She could not flatter<br/>herself with any idea of blindness in his attachment to her. She<br/>had received a very recent proof of its impartiality.— How shocked<br/>had he been by her behaviour to Miss Bates! How directly, how<br/>strongly had he expressed himself to her on the subject!—Not too<br/>strongly for the offence—but far, far too strongly to issue from<br/>any feeling softer than upright justice and clear-sighted<br/>goodwill.— She had no hope, nothing to deserve the name of hope,<br/>that he could have that sort of affection for herself which was now<br/>in question; but there was a hope (at times a slight one, at times<br/>much stronger,) that Harriet might have deceived herself, and be<br/>overrating his regard for her.—Wish it she must, for his sake—be<br/>the consequence nothing to herself, but his remaining single all<br/>his life. Could she be secure of that, indeed, of his never<br/>marrying at all, she believed she should be perfectly<br/>satisfied.—Let him but continue the same Mr. Knightley to her and<br/>her father, the same Mr. Knightley to all the world; let Donwell<br/>and Hartfield lose none of their precious intercourse of friendship<br/>and confidence, and her peace would be fully secured.—Marriage, in<br/>fact, would not do for her. It would be incompatible with what she<br/>owed to her father, and with what she felt for him. Nothing should<br/>separate her from her father. She would not marry, even if she were<br/>asked by Mr. Knightley.<br/><br/>It must be her ardent wish that Harriet might be disappointed;<br/>and she hoped, that when able to see them together again, she might<br/>at least be able to ascertain what the chances for it were.—She<br/>should see them henceforward with the closest observance; and<br/>wretchedly as she had hitherto misunderstood even those she was<br/>watching, she did not know how to admit that she could be blinded<br/>here.— He was expected back every day. The power of observation<br/>would be soon given—frightfully soon it appeared when her thoughts<br/>were in one course. In the meanwhile, she resolved against seeing<br/>Harriet.— It would do neither of them good, it would do the subject<br/>no good, to be talking of it farther.—She was resolved not to be<br/>convinced, as long as she could doubt, and yet had no authority for<br/>opposing Harriet's confidence. To talk would be only to<br/>irritate.—She wrote to her, therefore, kindly, but decisively, to<br/>beg that she would not, at present, come to Hartfield;<br/>acknowledging it to be her conviction, that all farther<br/>confidential discussion of one topic had better be avoided; and<br/>hoping, that if a few days were allowed to pass before they met<br/>again, except in the company of others—she objected only to a<br/>tete-a-tete—they might be able to act as if they had forgotten the<br/>conversation of yesterday.—Harriet submitted, and approved, and was<br/>grateful.<br/><br/>This point was just arranged, when a visitor arrived to tear<br/>Emma's thoughts a little from the one subject which had engrossed<br/>them, sleeping or waking, the last twenty-four hours—Mrs. Weston,<br/>who had been calling on her daughter-in-law elect, and took<br/>Hartfield in her way home, almost as much in duty to Emma as in<br/>pleasure to herself, to relate all the particulars of so<br/>interesting an interview.<br/><br/>Mr. Weston had accompanied her to Mrs. Bates's, and gone through<br/>his share of this essential attention most handsomely; but she<br/>having then induced Miss Fairfax to join her in an airing, was now<br/>returned with much more to say, and much more to say with<br/>satisfaction, than a quarter of an hour spent in Mrs. Bates's<br/>parlour, with all the encumbrance of awkward feelings, could have<br/>afforded.<br/><br/>A little curiosity Emma had; and she made the most of it while<br/>her friend related. Mrs. Weston had set off to pay the visit in a<br/>good deal of agitation herself; and in the first place had wished<br/>not to go at all at present, to be allowed merely to write to Miss<br/>Fairfax instead, and to defer this ceremonious call till a little<br/>time had passed, and Mr. Churchill could be reconciled to the<br/>engagement's becoming known; as, considering every thing, she<br/>thought such a visit could not be paid without leading to reports:—<br/>but Mr. Weston had thought differently; he was extremely anxious to<br/>shew his approbation to Miss Fairfax and her family, and did not<br/>conceive that any suspicion could be excited by it; or if it were,<br/>that it would be of any consequence; for "such things," he<br/>observed, "always got about." Emma smiled, and felt that Mr. Weston<br/>had very good reason for saying so. They had gone, in short—and<br/>very great had been the evident distress and confusion of the lady.<br/>She had hardly been able to speak a word, and every look and action<br/>had shewn how deeply she was suffering from consciousness. The<br/>quiet, heart-felt satisfaction of the old lady, and the rapturous<br/>delight of her daughter—who proved even too joyous to talk as<br/>usual, had been a gratifying, yet almost an affecting, scene. They<br/>were both so truly respectable in their happiness, so disinterested<br/>in every sensation; thought so much of Jane; so much of every body,<br/>and so little of themselves, that every kindly feeling was at work<br/>for them. Miss Fairfax's recent illness had offered a fair plea for<br/>Mrs. Weston to invite her to an airing; she had drawn back and<br/>declined at first, but, on being pressed had yielded; and, in the<br/>course of their drive, Mrs. Weston had, by gentle encouragement,<br/>overcome so much of her embarrassment, as to bring her to converse<br/>on the important subject. Apologies for her seemingly ungracious<br/>silence in their first reception, and the warmest expressions of<br/>the gratitude she was always feeling towards herself and Mr.<br/>Weston, must necessarily open the cause; but when these effusions<br/>were put by, they had talked a good deal of the present and of the<br/>future state of the engagement. Mrs. Weston was convinced that such<br/>conversation must be the greatest relief to her companion, pent up<br/>within her own mind as every thing had so long been, and was very<br/>much pleased with all that she had said on the subject.<br/><br/>"On the misery of what she had suffered, during the concealment<br/>of so many months," continued Mrs. Weston, "she was energetic. This<br/>was one of her expressions. `I will not say, that since I entered<br/>into the engagement I have not had some happy moments; but I can<br/>say, that I have never known the blessing of one tranquil hour:'—<br/>and the quivering lip, Emma, which uttered it, was an attestation<br/>that I felt at my heart."<br/><br/>
