"True, true," he answered, warmly. "No, not true on your side.<br/>You can have no superior, but most true on mine.—She is a complete<br/>angel. Look at her. Is not she an angel in every gesture? Observe<br/>the turn of her throat. Observe her eyes, as she is looking up at<br/>my father.— You will be glad to hear (inclining his head, and<br/>whispering seriously) that my uncle means to give her all my aunt's<br/>jewels. They are to be new set. I am resolved to have some in an<br/>ornament for the head. Will not it be beautiful in her dark<br/>hair?"<br/><br/>"Very beautiful, indeed," replied Emma; and she spoke so kindly,<br/>that he gratefully burst out,<br/><br/>"How delighted I am to see you again! and to see you in such<br/>excellent looks!—I would not have missed this meeting for the<br/>world. I should certainly have called at Hartfield, had you failed<br/>to come."<br/><br/>The others had been talking of the child, Mrs. Weston giving an<br/>account of a little alarm she had been under, the evening before,<br/>from the infant's appearing not quite well. She believed she had<br/>been foolish, but it had alarmed her, and she had been within half<br/>a minute of sending for Mr. Perry. Perhaps she ought to be ashamed,<br/>but Mr. Weston had been almost as uneasy as herself.—In ten<br/>minutes, however, the child had been perfectly well again. This was<br/>her history; and particularly interesting it was to Mr. Woodhouse,<br/>who commended her very much for thinking of sending for Perry, and<br/>only regretted that she had not done it. "She should always send<br/>for Perry, if the child appeared in the slightest degree<br/>disordered, were it only for a moment. She could not be too soon<br/>alarmed, nor send for Perry too often. It was a pity, perhaps, that<br/>he had not come last night; for, though the child seemed well now,<br/>very well considering, it would probably have been better if Perry<br/>had seen it."<br/><br/>Frank Churchill caught the name.<br/><br/>"Perry!" said he to Emma, and trying, as he spoke, to catch Miss<br/>Fairfax's eye. "My friend Mr. Perry! What are they saying about Mr.<br/>Perry?—Has he been here this morning?—And how does he travel<br/>now?—Has he set up his carriage?"<br/><br/>Emma soon recollected, and understood him; and while she joined<br/>in the laugh, it was evident from Jane's countenance that she too<br/>was really hearing him, though trying to seem deaf.<br/><br/>"Such an extraordinary dream of mine!" he cried. "I can never<br/>think of it without laughing.—She hears us, she hears us, Miss<br/>Woodhouse. I see it in her cheek, her smile, her vain attempt to<br/>frown. Look at her. Do not you see that, at this instant, the very<br/>passage of her own letter, which sent me the report, is passing<br/>under her eye— that the whole blunder is spread before her—that she<br/>can attend to nothing else, though pretending to listen to the<br/>others?"<br/><br/>Jane was forced to smile completely, for a moment; and the smile<br/>partly remained as she turned towards him, and said in a conscious,<br/>low, yet steady voice,<br/><br/>"How you can bear such recollections, is astonishing to me!—<br/>They will sometimes obtrude—but how you can court them!"<br/><br/>He had a great deal to say in return, and very entertainingly;<br/>but Emma's feelings were chiefly with Jane, in the argument; and on<br/>leaving Randalls, and falling naturally into a comparison of the<br/>two men, she felt, that pleased as she had been to see Frank<br/>Churchill, and really regarding him as she did with friendship, she<br/>had never been more sensible of Mr. Knightley's high superiority of<br/>character. The happiness of this most happy day, received its<br/>completion, in the animated contemplation of his worth which this<br/>comparison produced.<br/>
