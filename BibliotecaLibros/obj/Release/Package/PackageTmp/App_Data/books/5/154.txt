"Sir," said Mr. Woodhouse, rather warmly, "you are very much
mistaken if you suppose Mr. Perry to be that sort of character. Mr.
Perry is extremely concerned when any of us are ill. But I do not
understand how the room at the Crown can be safer for you than your
father's house."

"From the very circumstance of its being larger, sir. We shall
have no occasion to open the windows at all—not once the whole
evening; and it is that dreadful habit of opening the windows,
letting in cold air upon heated bodies, which (as you well know,
sir) does the mischief."

"Open the windows!—but surely, Mr. Churchill, nobody would think
of opening the windows at Randalls. Nobody could be so imprudent! I
never heard of such a thing. Dancing with open windows!—I am sure,
neither your father nor Mrs. Weston (poor Miss Taylor that was)
would suffer it."

"Ah! sir—but a thoughtless young person will sometimes step
behind a window-curtain, and throw up a sash, without its being
suspected. I have often known it done myself."

"Have you indeed, sir?—Bless me! I never could have supposed it.
But I live out of the world, and am often astonished at what I
hear. However, this does make a difference; and, perhaps, when we
come to talk it over—but these sort of things require a good deal
of consideration. One cannot resolve upon them in a hurry. If Mr.
and Mrs. Weston will be so obliging as to call here one morning, we
may talk it over, and see what can be done."

"But, unfortunately, sir, my time is so limited—"

"Oh!" interrupted Emma, "there will be plenty of time for
talking every thing over. There is no hurry at all. If it can be
contrived to be at the Crown, papa, it will be very convenient for
the horses. They will be so near their own stable."

"So they will, my dear. That is a great thing. Not that James
ever complains; but it is right to spare our horses when we can. If
I could be sure of the rooms being thoroughly aired—but is Mrs.
Stokes to be trusted? I doubt it. I do not know her, even by
sight."

"I can answer for every thing of that nature, sir, because it
will be under Mrs. Weston's care. Mrs. Weston undertakes to direct
the whole."

"There, papa!—Now you must be satisfied—Our own dear Mrs.
Weston, who is carefulness itself. Do not you remember what Mr.
Perry said, so many years ago, when I had the measles? `If Miss
Taylor undertakes to wrap Miss Emma up, you need not have any
fears, sir.' How often have I heard you speak of it as such a
compliment to her!"

"Aye, very true. Mr. Perry did say so. I shall never forget it.
Poor little Emma! You were very bad with the measles; that is, you
would have been very bad, but for Perry's great attention. He came
four times a day for a week. He said, from the first, it was a very
good sort—which was our great comfort; but the measles are a
dreadful complaint. I hope whenever poor Isabella's little ones
have the measles, she will send for Perry."
