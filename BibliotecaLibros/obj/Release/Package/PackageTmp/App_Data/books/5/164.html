"I must not dwell upon it," said she.—"I must not think of it. I<br/>know the danger of indulging such speculations. But stranger things<br/>have happened; and when we cease to care for each other as we do<br/>now, it will be the means of confirming us in that sort of true<br/>disinterested friendship which I can already look forward to with<br/>pleasure."<br/><br/>It was well to have a comfort in store on Harriet's behalf,<br/>though it might be wise to let the fancy touch it seldom; for evil<br/>in that quarter was at hand. As Frank Churchill's arrival had<br/>succeeded Mr. Elton's engagement in the conversation of Highbury,<br/>as the latest interest had entirely borne down the first, so now<br/>upon Frank Churchill's disappearance, Mr. Elton's concerns were<br/>assuming the most irresistible form.—His wedding-day was named. He<br/>would soon be among them again; Mr. Elton and his bride. There was<br/>hardly time to talk over the first letter from Enscombe before "Mr.<br/>Elton and his bride" was in every body's mouth, and Frank Churchill<br/>was forgotten. Emma grew sick at the sound. She had had three weeks<br/>of happy exemption from Mr. Elton; and Harriet's mind, she had been<br/>willing to hope, had been lately gaining strength. With Mr.<br/>Weston's ball in view at least, there had been a great deal of<br/>insensibility to other things; but it was now too evident that she<br/>had not attained such a state of composure as could stand against<br/>the actual approach—new carriage, bell-ringing, and all.<br/><br/>Poor Harriet was in a flutter of spirits which required all the<br/>reasonings and soothings and attentions of every kind that Emma<br/>could give. Emma felt that she could not do too much for her, that<br/>Harriet had a right to all her ingenuity and all her patience; but<br/>it was heavy work to be for ever convincing without producing any<br/>effect, for ever agreed to, without being able to make their<br/>opinions the same. Harriet listened submissively, and said "it was<br/>very true— it was just as Miss Woodhouse described—it was not worth<br/>while to think about them—and she would not think about them any<br/>longer" but no change of subject could avail, and the next<br/>half-hour saw her as anxious and restless about the Eltons as<br/>before. At last Emma attacked her on another ground.<br/><br/>"Your allowing yourself to be so occupied and so unhappy about<br/>Mr. Elton's marrying, Harriet, is the strongest reproach you can<br/>make me. You could not give me a greater reproof for the mistake I<br/>fell into. It was all my doing, I know. I have not forgotten it, I<br/>assure you.—Deceived myself, I did very miserably deceive you— and<br/>it will be a painful reflection to me for ever. Do not imagine me<br/>in danger of forgetting it."<br/><br/>Harriet felt this too much to utter more than a few words of<br/>eager exclamation. Emma continued,<br/><br/>"I have not said, exert yourself Harriet for my sake; think<br/>less, talk less of Mr. Elton for my sake; because for your own sake<br/>rather, I would wish it to be done, for the sake of what is more<br/>important than my comfort, a habit of self-command in you, a<br/>consideration of what is your duty, an attention to propriety, an<br/>endeavour to avoid the suspicions of others, to save your health<br/>and credit, and restore your tranquillity. These are the motives<br/>which I have been pressing on you. They are very important—and<br/>sorry I am that you cannot feel them sufficiently to act upon them.<br/>My being saved from pain is a very secondary consideration. I want<br/>you to save yourself from greater pain. Perhaps I may sometimes<br/>have felt that Harriet would not forget what was due—or rather what<br/>would be kind by me."<br/><br/>This appeal to her affections did more than all the rest. The<br/>idea of wanting gratitude and consideration for Miss Woodhouse,<br/>whom she really loved extremely, made her wretched for a while, and<br/>when the violence of grief was comforted away, still remained<br/>powerful enough to prompt to what was right and support her in it<br/>very tolerably.<br/><br/>"You, who have been the best friend I ever had in my life— Want<br/>gratitude to you!—Nobody is equal to you!—I care for nobody as I do<br/>for you!—Oh! Miss Woodhouse, how ungrateful I have been!"<br/><br/>Such expressions, assisted as they were by every thing that look<br/>and manner could do, made Emma feel that she had never loved<br/>Harriet so well, nor valued her affection so highly before.<br/><br/>"There is no charm equal to tenderness of heart," said she<br/>afterwards to herself. "There is nothing to be compared to it.<br/>Warmth and tenderness of heart, with an affectionate, open manner,<br/>will beat all the clearness of head in the world, for attraction, I<br/>am sure it will. It is tenderness of heart which makes my dear<br/>father so generally beloved—which gives Isabella all her<br/>popularity.— I have it not—but I know how to prize and respect<br/>it.—Harriet is my superior in all the charm and all the felicity it<br/>gives. Dear Harriet!—I would not change you for the<br/>clearest-headed, longest-sighted, best-judging female breathing.<br/>Oh! the coldness of a Jane Fairfax!—Harriet is worth a hundred<br/>such—And for a wife— a sensible man's wife—it is invaluable. I<br/>mention no names; but happy the man who changes Emma for<br/>Harriet!"<br/><br/><br/>
