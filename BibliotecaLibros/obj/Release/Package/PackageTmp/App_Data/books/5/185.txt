When the ladies returned to the drawing-room after dinner, Emma
found it hardly possible to prevent their making two distinct
parties;— with so much perseverance in judging and behaving ill did
Mrs. Elton engross Jane Fairfax and slight herself. She and Mrs.
Weston were obliged to be almost always either talking together or
silent together. Mrs. Elton left them no choice. If Jane repressed
her for a little time, she soon began again; and though much that
passed between them was in a half-whisper, especially on Mrs.
Elton's side, there was no avoiding a knowledge of their principal
subjects: The post-office—catching cold—fetching letters—and
friendship, were long under discussion; and to them succeeded one,
which must be at least equally unpleasant to Jane—inquiries whether
she had yet heard of any situation likely to suit her, and
professions of Mrs. Elton's meditated activity.

"Here is April come!" said she, "I get quite anxious about you.
June will soon be here."

"But I have never fixed on June or any other month—merely looked
forward to the summer in general."

"But have you really heard of nothing?"

"I have not even made any inquiry; I do not wish to make any
yet."

"Oh! my dear, we cannot begin too early; you are not aware of
the difficulty of procuring exactly the desirable thing."
