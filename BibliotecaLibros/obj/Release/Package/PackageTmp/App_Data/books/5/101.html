"Yes, that of course."<br/><br/>"Jane caught a bad cold, poor thing! so long ago as the 7th of<br/>November, (as I am going to read to you,) and has never been well<br/>since. A long time, is not it, for a cold to hang upon her? She<br/>never mentioned it before, because she would not alarm us. Just<br/>like her! so considerate!—But however, she is so far from well,<br/>that her kind friends the Campbells think she had better come home,<br/>and try an air that always agrees with her; and they have no doubt<br/>that three or four months at Highbury will entirely cure her— and<br/>it is certainly a great deal better that she should come here, than<br/>go to Ireland, if she is unwell. Nobody could nurse her, as we<br/>should do."<br/><br/>"It appears to me the most desirable arrangement in the<br/>world."<br/><br/>"And so she is to come to us next Friday or Saturday, and the<br/>Campbells leave town in their way to Holyhead the Monday following—<br/>as you will find from Jane's letter. So sudden!—You may guess, dear<br/>Miss Woodhouse, what a flurry it has thrown me in! If it was not<br/>for the drawback of her illness—but I am afraid we must expect to<br/>see her grown thin, and looking very poorly. I must tell you what<br/>an unlucky thing happened to me, as to that. I always make a point<br/>of reading Jane's letters through to myself first, before I read<br/>them aloud to my mother, you know, for fear of there being any<br/>thing in them to distress her. Jane desired me to do it, so I<br/>always do: and so I began to-day with my usual caution; but no<br/>sooner did I come to the mention of her being unwell, than I burst<br/>out, quite frightened, with `Bless me! poor Jane is ill!'— which my<br/>mother, being on the watch, heard distinctly, and was sadly alarmed<br/>at. However, when I read on, I found it was not near so bad as I<br/>had fancied at first; and I make so light of it now to her, that<br/>she does not think much about it. But I cannot imagine how I could<br/>be so off my guard. If Jane does not get well soon, we will call in<br/>Mr. Perry. The expense shall not be thought of; and though he is so<br/>liberal, and so fond of Jane that I dare say he would not mean to<br/>charge any thing for attendance, we could not suffer it to be so,<br/>you know. He has a wife and family to maintain, and is not to be<br/>giving away his time. Well, now I have just given you a hint of<br/>what Jane writes about, we will turn to her letter, and I am sure<br/>she tells her own story a great deal better than I can tell it for<br/>her."<br/><br/>"I am afraid we must be running away," said Emma, glancing at<br/>Harriet, and beginning to rise—"My father will be expecting us. I<br/>had no intention, I thought I had no power of staying more than<br/>five minutes, when I first entered the house. I merely called,<br/>because I would not pass the door without inquiring after Mrs.<br/>Bates; but I have been so pleasantly detained! Now, however, we<br/>must wish you and Mrs. Bates good morning."<br/><br/>And not all that could be urged to detain her succeeded. She<br/>regained the street—happy in this, that though much had been forced<br/>on her against her will, though she had in fact heard the whole<br/>substance of Jane Fairfax's letter, she had been able to escape the<br/>letter itself.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
