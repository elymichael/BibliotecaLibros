"But the imprudence of such a match!"<br/><br/>"I am not speaking of its prudence; merely its probability."<br/><br/>"I see no probability in it, unless you have any better<br/>foundation than what you mention. His good-nature, his humanity, as<br/>I tell you, would be quite enough to account for the horses. He has<br/>a great regard for the Bateses, you know, independent of Jane<br/>Fairfax— and is always glad to shew them attention. My dear Mrs.<br/>Weston, do not take to match-making. You do it very ill. Jane<br/>Fairfax mistress of the Abbey!—Oh! no, no;—every feeling revolts.<br/>For his own sake, I would not have him do so mad a thing."<br/><br/>"Imprudent, if you please—but not mad. Excepting inequality of<br/>fortune, and perhaps a little disparity of age, I can see nothing<br/>unsuitable."<br/><br/>"But Mr. Knightley does not want to marry. I am sure he has not<br/>the least idea of it. Do not put it into his head. Why should he<br/>marry?— He is as happy as possible by himself; with his farm, and<br/>his sheep, and his library, and all the parish to manage; and he is<br/>extremely fond of his brother's children. He has no occasion to<br/>marry, either to fill up his time or his heart."<br/><br/>"My dear Emma, as long as he thinks so, it is so; but if he<br/>really loves Jane Fairfax—"<br/><br/>"Nonsense! He does not care about Jane Fairfax. In the way of<br/>love, I am sure he does not. He would do any good to her, or her<br/>family; but—"<br/><br/>"Well," said Mrs. Weston, laughing, "perhaps the greatest good<br/>he could do them, would be to give Jane such a respectable<br/>home."<br/><br/>"If it would be good to her, I am sure it would be evil to<br/>himself; a very shameful and degrading connexion. How would he bear<br/>to have Miss Bates belonging to him?—To have her haunting the<br/>Abbey, and thanking him all day long for his great kindness in<br/>marrying Jane?— `So very kind and obliging!—But he always had been<br/>such a very kind neighbour!' And then fly off, through half a<br/>sentence, to her mother's old petticoat. `Not that it was such a<br/>very old petticoat either—for still it would last a great<br/>while—and, indeed, she must thankfully say that their petticoats<br/>were all very strong.'"<br/><br/>"For shame, Emma! Do not mimic her. You divert me against my<br/>conscience. And, upon my word, I do not think Mr. Knightley would<br/>be much disturbed by Miss Bates. Little things do not irritate him.<br/>She might talk on; and if he wanted to say any thing himself, he<br/>would only talk louder, and drown her voice. But the question is<br/>not, whether it would be a bad connexion for him, but whether he<br/>wishes it; and I think he does. I have heard him speak, and so must<br/>you, so very highly of Jane Fairfax! The interest he takes in her—<br/>his anxiety about her health—his concern that she should have no<br/>happier prospect! I have heard him express himself so warmly on<br/>those points!—Such an admirer of her performance on the pianoforte,<br/>and of her voice! I have heard him say that he could listen to her<br/>for ever. Oh! and I had almost forgotten one idea that occurred to<br/>me—this pianoforte that has been sent here by somebody— though we<br/>have all been so well satisfied to consider it a present from the<br/>Campbells, may it not be from Mr. Knightley? I cannot help<br/>suspecting him. I think he is just the person to do it, even<br/>without being in love."<br/><br/>"Then it can be no argument to prove that he is in love. But I<br/>do not think it is at all a likely thing for him to do. Mr.<br/>Knightley does nothing mysteriously."<br/>
