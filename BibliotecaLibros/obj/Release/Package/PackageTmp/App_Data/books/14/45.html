<br/><br/>O, my lord,<br/>When you went onward on this ended action,<br/>I look'd upon her with a soldier's eye,<br/>That liked, but had a rougher task in hand<br/>Than to drive liking to the name of love:<br/>But now I am return'd and that war-thoughts<br/>Have left their places vacant, in their rooms<br/>Come thronging soft and delicate desires,<br/>All prompting me how fair young Hero is,<br/>Saying, I liked her ere I went to wars.<br/><br/><br/>DON PEDRO<br/><br/><br/>Thou wilt be like a lover presently<br/>And tire the hearer with a book of words.<br/>If thou dost love fair Hero, cherish it,<br/>And I will break with her and with her father,<br/>
