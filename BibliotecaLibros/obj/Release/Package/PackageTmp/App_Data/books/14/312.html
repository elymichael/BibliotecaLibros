Away! I will not have to do with you.<br/><br/><br/>LEONATO<br/><br/><br/>Canst thou so daff me? Thou hast kill'd my child:<br/>If thou kill'st me, boy, thou shalt kill a man.<br/><br/><br/>ANTONIO<br/><br/><br/>He shall kill two of us, and men indeed:<br/>But that's no matter; let him kill one first;<br/>Win me and wear me; let him answer me.<br/>Come, follow me, boy; come, sir boy, come, follow me:<br/>Sir boy, I'll whip you from your foining fence;<br/>Nay, as I am a gentleman, I will.<br/><br/><br/>
