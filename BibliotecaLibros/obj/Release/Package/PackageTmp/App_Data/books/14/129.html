<br/>BALTHASAR<br/><br/><br/>Because you talk of wooing, I will sing;<br/>Since many a wooer doth commence his suit<br/>To her he thinks not worthy, yet he wooes,<br/>Yet will he swear he loves.<br/><br/><br/>DON PEDRO<br/><br/><br/>Now, pray thee, come;<br/>Or, if thou wilt hold longer argument,<br/>Do it in notes.<br/><br/><br/>BALTHASAR<br/><br/><br/>
