DON PEDRO<br/><br/><br/>Do so: farewell.<br/><br/>Exit BALTHASAR<br/><br/>Come hither, Leonato. What was it you told me of<br/>to-day, that your niece Beatrice was in love with<br/>Signior Benedick?<br/><br/><br/>CLAUDIO<br/><br/><br/>O, ay: stalk on. stalk on; the fowl sits. I did<br/>never think that lady would have loved any man.<br/><br/><br/>LEONATO<br/><br/>
