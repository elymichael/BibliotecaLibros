Graves, yawn and yield your dead,<br/>Till death be uttered,<br/>Heavily, heavily.<br/><br/><br/>CLAUDIO<br/><br/><br/>Now, unto thy bones good night!<br/>Yearly will I do this rite.<br/><br/><br/>DON PEDRO<br/><br/><br/>Good morrow, masters; put your torches out:<br/>The wolves have prey'd; and look, the gentle day,<br/>Before the wheels of Phoebus, round about<br/>Dapples the drowsy east with spots of grey.<br/>Thanks to you all, and leave us: fare you well.<br/><br/>
