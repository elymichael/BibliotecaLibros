Were I not old. Know, Claudio, to thy head,<br/>Thou hast so wrong'd mine innocent child and me<br/>That I am forced to lay my reverence by<br/>And, with grey hairs and bruise of many days,<br/>Do challenge thee to trial of a man.<br/>I say thou hast belied mine innocent child;<br/>Thy slander hath gone through and through her heart,<br/>And she lies buried with her ancestors;<br/>O, in a tomb where never scandal slept,<br/>Save this of hers, framed by thy villany!<br/><br/><br/>CLAUDIO<br/><br/><br/>My villany?<br/><br/><br/>LEONATO<br/><br/><br/>
