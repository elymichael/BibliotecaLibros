<br/><br/>BENEDICK<br/><br/><br/>Nay, mock not, mock not. The body of your<br/>discourse is sometime guarded with fragments, and<br/>the guards are but slightly basted on neither: ere<br/>you flout old ends any further, examine your<br/>conscience: and so I leave you.<br/><br/>Exit<br/><br/><br/>CLAUDIO<br/><br/><br/>My liege, your highness now may do me good.<br/><br/><br/>DON PEDRO<br/>
