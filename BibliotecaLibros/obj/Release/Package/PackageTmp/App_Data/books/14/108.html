I cry you mercy, uncle. By your grace's pardon.<br/><br/>Exit<br/><br/><br/>DON PEDRO<br/><br/><br/>By my troth, a pleasant-spirited lady.<br/><br/><br/>LEONATO<br/><br/><br/>There's little of the melancholy element in her, my<br/>lord: she is never sad but when she sleeps, and<br/>not ever sad then; for I have heard my daughter say,<br/>she hath often dreamed of unhappiness and waked<br/>herself with laughing.<br/><br/><br/>
