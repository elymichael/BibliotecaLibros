And, truly, I'll devise some honest slanders<br/>To stain my cousin with: one doth not know<br/>How much an ill word may empoison liking.<br/><br/><br/>URSULA<br/><br/><br/>O, do not do your cousin such a wrong.<br/>She cannot be so much without true judgment—<br/>Having so swift and excellent a wit<br/>As she is prized to have—as to refuse<br/>So rare a gentleman as Signior Benedick.<br/><br/><br/>HERO<br/><br/><br/>He is the only man of Italy.<br/>Always excepted my dear Claudio.<br/><br/>
