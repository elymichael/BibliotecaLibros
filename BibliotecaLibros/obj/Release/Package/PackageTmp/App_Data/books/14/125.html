<br/>I do much wonder that one man, seeing how much<br/>another man is a fool when he dedicates his<br/>behaviors to love, will, after he hath laughed at<br/>such shallow follies in others, become the argument<br/>of his own scorn by failing in love: and such a man<br/>is Claudio. I have known when there was no music<br/>with him but the drum and the fife; and now had he<br/>rather hear the tabour and the pipe: I have known<br/>when he would have walked ten mile a-foot to see a<br/>good armour; and now will he lie ten nights awake,<br/>carving the fashion of a new doublet. He was wont to<br/>speak plain and to the purpose, like an honest man<br/>and a soldier; and now is he turned orthography; his<br/>words are a very fantastical banquet, just so many<br/>strange dishes. May I be so converted and see with<br/>these eyes? I cannot tell; I think not: I will not<br/>be sworn, but love may transform me to an oyster; but<br/>I'll take my oath on it, till he have made an oyster<br/>of me, he shall never make me such a fool. One woman<br/>is fair, yet I am well; another is wise, yet I am<br/>
