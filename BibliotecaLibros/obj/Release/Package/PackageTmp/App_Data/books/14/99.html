<br/>Exit<br/><br/><br/>DON PEDRO<br/><br/><br/>Come, lady, come; you have lost the heart of<br/>Signior Benedick.<br/><br/><br/>BEATRICE<br/><br/><br/>Indeed, my lord, he lent it me awhile; and I gave<br/>him use for it, a double heart for his single one:<br/>marry, once before he won it of me with false dice,<br/>therefore your grace may well say I have lost it.<br/><br/><br/>DON PEDRO<br/>
