To make you answer truly to your name.<br/><br/><br/>HERO<br/><br/><br/>Is it not Hero? Who can blot that name<br/>With any just reproach?<br/><br/><br/>CLAUDIO<br/><br/><br/>Marry, that can Hero;<br/>Hero itself can blot out Hero's virtue.<br/>What man was he talk'd with you yesternight<br/>Out at your window betwixt twelve and one?<br/>Now, if you are a maid, answer to this.<br/><br/><br/>HERO<br/>
