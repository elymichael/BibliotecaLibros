And greedily devour the treacherous bait:<br/>So angle we for Beatrice; who even now<br/>Is couched in the woodbine coverture.<br/>Fear you not my part of the dialogue.<br/><br/><br/>HERO<br/><br/><br/>Then go we near her, that her ear lose nothing<br/>Of the false sweet bait that we lay for it.<br/><br/>Approaching the bower<br/><br/>No, truly, Ursula, she is too disdainful;<br/>I know her spirits are as coy and wild<br/>As haggerds of the rock.<br/><br/><br/>URSULA<br/><br/>
