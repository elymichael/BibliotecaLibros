<br/>DON PEDRO<br/><br/><br/>Come, Balthasar, we'll hear that song again.<br/><br/><br/>BALTHASAR<br/><br/><br/>O, good my lord, tax not so bad a voice<br/>To slander music any more than once.<br/><br/><br/>DON PEDRO<br/><br/><br/>It is the witness still of excellency<br/>To put a strange face on his own perfection.<br/>I pray thee, sing, and let me woo no more.<br/><br/>
