<br/><br/>LEONATO<br/><br/><br/>To-morrow then I will expect your coming;<br/>To-night I take my leave. This naughty man<br/>Shall face to face be brought to Margaret,<br/>Who I believe was pack'd in all this wrong,<br/>Hired to it by your brother.<br/><br/><br/>BORACHIO<br/><br/><br/>No, by my soul, she was not,<br/>Nor knew not what she did when she spoke to me,<br/>But always hath been just and virtuous<br/>In any thing that I do know by her.<br/><br/><br/>
