<br/><br/>BENEDICK<br/><br/><br/>Alas, poor hurt fowl! now will he creep into sedges.<br/>But that my Lady Beatrice should know me, and not<br/>know me! The prince's fool! Ha? It may be I go<br/>under that title because I am merry. Yea, but so I<br/>am apt to do myself wrong; I am not so reputed: it<br/>is the base, though bitter, disposition of Beatrice<br/>that puts the world into her person and so gives me<br/>out. Well, I'll be revenged as I may.<br/><br/>Re-enter DON PEDRO<br/><br/><br/>DON PEDRO<br/><br/><br/>Now, signior, where's the count? did you see him?<br/>
