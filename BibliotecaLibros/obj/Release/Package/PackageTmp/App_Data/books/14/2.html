<br/><br/>About Shakespeare:<br/><br/>William Shakespeare (baptised 26 April 1564 â€“ died 23 April<br/>1616) was an English poet and playwright, widely regarded as the<br/>greatest writer in the English language and the world's pre-eminent<br/>dramatist. He is often called England's national poet and the "Bard<br/>of Avon" (or simply "The Bard"). His surviving works consist of 38<br/>plays, 154 sonnets, two long narrative poems, and several other<br/>poems. His plays have been translated into every major living<br/>language, and are performed more often than those of any other<br/>playwright. Shakespeare was born and raised in Stratford-upon-Avon.<br/>At the age of 18 he married Anne Hathaway, who bore him three<br/>children: Susanna, and twins Hamnet and Judith. Between 1585 and<br/>1592 he began a successful career in London as an actor, writer,<br/>and part owner of the playing company the Lord Chamberlain's Men,<br/>later known as the King's Men. He appears to have retired to<br/>Stratford around 1613, where he died three years later. Few records<br/>of Shakespeare's private life survive, and there has been<br/>considerable speculation about such matters as his sexuality,<br/>religious beliefs, and whether the works attributed to him were<br/>written by others. Shakespeare produced most of his known work<br/>between 1590 and 1613. His early plays were mainly comedies and<br/>histories, genres he raised to the peak of sophistication and<br/>artistry by the end of the sixteenth century. Next he wrote mainly<br/>tragedies until about 1608, including Hamlet, King Lear, and<br/>Macbeth, considered some of the finest examples in the English<br/>language. In his last phase, he wrote tragicomedies, also known as<br/>romances, and collaborated with other playwrights. Many of his<br/>plays were published in editions of varying quality and accuracy<br/>during his lifetime, and in 1623 two of his former theatrical<br/>colleagues published the First Folio, a collected edition of his<br/>dramatic works that included all but two of the plays now<br/>recognised as Shakespeare's. Shakespeare was a respected poet and<br/>playwright in his own day, but his reputation did not rise to its<br/>present heights until the nineteenth century. The Romantics, in<br/>particular, acclaimed Shakespeare's genius, and the Victorians<br/>hero-worshipped Shakespeare with a reverence that George Bernard<br/>Shaw called "bardolatry". In the twentieth century, his work was<br/>repeatedly adopted and rediscovered by new movements in scholarship<br/>and performance. His plays remain highly popular today and are<br/>consistently performed and reinterpreted in diverse cultural and<br/>political contexts throughout the world.
