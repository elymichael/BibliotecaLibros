<br/><br/>BENEDICK<br/><br/><br/>[Aside to CLAUDIO] You are a villain; I jest not:<br/>I will make it good how you dare, with what you<br/>dare, and when you dare. Do me right, or I will<br/>protest your cowardice. You have killed a sweet<br/>lady, and her death shall fall heavy on you. Let me<br/>hear from you.<br/><br/><br/>CLAUDIO<br/><br/><br/>Well, I will meet you, so I may have good cheer.<br/><br/><br/>DON PEDRO<br/><br/>
