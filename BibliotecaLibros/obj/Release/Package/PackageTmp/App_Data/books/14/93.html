<br/><br/>BENEDICK<br/><br/><br/>Troth, my lord, I have played the part of Lady Fame.<br/>I found him here as melancholy as a lodge in a<br/>warren: I told him, and I think I told him true,<br/>that your grace had got the good will of this young<br/>lady; and I offered him my company to a willow-tree,<br/>either to make him a garland, as being forsaken, or<br/>to bind him up a rod, as being worthy to be whipped.<br/><br/><br/>DON PEDRO<br/><br/><br/>To be whipped! What's his fault?<br/><br/><br/>BENEDICK<br/>
