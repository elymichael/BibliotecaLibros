<br/><br/>DON PEDRO<br/><br/><br/>Nay, that would be as great a soil in the new gloss<br/>of your marriage as to show a child his new coat<br/>and forbid him to wear it. I will only be bold<br/>with Benedick for his company; for, from the crown<br/>of his head to the sole of his foot, he is all<br/>mirth: he hath twice or thrice cut Cupid's<br/>bow-string and the little hangman dare not shoot at<br/>him; he hath a heart as sound as a bell and his<br/>tongue is the clapper, for what his heart thinks his<br/>tongue speaks.<br/><br/><br/>BENEDICK<br/><br/><br/>Gallants, I am not as I have been.<br/>
