world's end? I will go on the slightest errand now<br/>to the Antipodes that you can devise to send me on;<br/>I will fetch you a tooth-picker now from the<br/>furthest inch of Asia, bring you the length of<br/>Prester John's foot, fetch you a hair off the great<br/>Cham's beard, do you any embassage to the Pigmies,<br/>rather than hold three words' conference with this<br/>harpy. You have no employment for me?<br/><br/><br/>DON PEDRO<br/><br/><br/>None, but to desire your good company.<br/><br/><br/>BENEDICK<br/><br/><br/>O God, sir, here's a dish I love not: I cannot<br/>endure my Lady Tongue.<br/>
