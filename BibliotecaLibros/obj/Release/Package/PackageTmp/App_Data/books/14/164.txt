As Beatrice is, cannot be commendable:
But who dare tell her so? If I should speak,
She would mock me into air; O, she would laugh me
Out of myself, press me to death with wit.
Therefore let Benedick, like cover'd fire,
Consume away in sighs, waste inwardly:
It were a better death than die with mocks,
Which is as bad as die with tickling.


URSULA


Yet tell her of it: hear what she will say.


HERO


No; rather I will go to Benedick
And counsel him to fight against his passion.
