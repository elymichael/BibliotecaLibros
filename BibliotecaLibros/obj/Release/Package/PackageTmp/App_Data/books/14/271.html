Whiles it was ours. So will it fare with Claudio:<br/>When he shall hear she died upon his words,<br/>The idea of her life shall sweetly creep<br/>Into his study of imagination,<br/>And every lovely organ of her life<br/>Shall come apparell'd in more precious habit,<br/>More moving-delicate and full of life,<br/>Into the eye and prospect of his soul,<br/>Than when she lived indeed; then shall he mourn,<br/>If ever love had interest in his liver,<br/>And wish he had not so accused her,<br/>No, though he thought his accusation true.<br/>Let this be so, and doubt not but success<br/>Will fashion the event in better shape<br/>Than I can lay it down in likelihood.<br/>But if all aim but this be levell'd false,<br/>The supposition of the lady's death<br/>Will quench the wonder of her infamy:<br/>And if it sort not well, you may conceal her,<br/>As best befits her wounded reputation,<br/>In some reclusive and religious life,<br/>
