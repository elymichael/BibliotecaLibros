Graves, yawn and yield your dead,
Till death be uttered,
Heavily, heavily.


CLAUDIO


Now, unto thy bones good night!
Yearly will I do this rite.


DON PEDRO


Good morrow, masters; put your torches out:
The wolves have prey'd; and look, the gentle day,
Before the wheels of Phoebus, round about
Dapples the drowsy east with spots of grey.
Thanks to you all, and leave us: fare you well.
