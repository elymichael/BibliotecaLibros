<br/><br/>MARGARET<br/><br/><br/>Of what, lady? of speaking honourably? Is not<br/>marriage honourable in a beggar? Is not your lord<br/>honourable without marriage? I think you would have<br/>me say, 'saving your reverence, a husband:' and bad<br/>thinking do not wrest true speaking, I'll offend<br/>nobody: is there any harm in 'the heavier for a<br/>husband'? None, I think, and it be the right husband<br/>and the right wife; otherwise 'tis light, and not<br/>heavy: ask my Lady Beatrice else; here she comes.<br/><br/>Enter BEATRICE<br/><br/><br/>HERO<br/><br/><br/>
