<br/>DON PEDRO<br/><br/><br/>Well, we will hear further of it by your daughter:<br/>let it cool the while. I love Benedick well; and I<br/>could wish he would modestly examine himself, to see<br/>how much he is unworthy so good a lady.<br/><br/><br/>LEONATO<br/><br/><br/>My lord, will you walk? dinner is ready.<br/><br/><br/>CLAUDIO<br/><br/><br/>If he do not dote on her upon this, I will never<br/>trust my expectation.<br/>
