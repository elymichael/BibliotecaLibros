<br/>BEATRICE<br/><br/><br/>Good Lord, for alliance! Thus goes every one to the<br/>world but I, and I am sunburnt; I may sit in a<br/>corner and cry heigh-ho for a husband!<br/><br/><br/>DON PEDRO<br/><br/><br/>Lady Beatrice, I will get you one.<br/><br/><br/>BEATRICE<br/><br/><br/>I would rather have one of your father's getting.<br/>Hath your grace ne'er a brother like you? Your<br/>father got excellent husbands, if a maid could come by<br/>them.<br/>
