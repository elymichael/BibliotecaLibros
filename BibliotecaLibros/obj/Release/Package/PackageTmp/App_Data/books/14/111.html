seven-night; and a time too brief, too, to have all<br/>things answer my mind.<br/><br/><br/>DON PEDRO<br/><br/><br/>Come, you shake the head at so long a breathing:<br/>but, I warrant thee, Claudio, the time shall not go<br/>dully by us. I will in the interim undertake one of<br/>Hercules' labours; which is, to bring Signior<br/>Benedick and the Lady Beatrice into a mountain of<br/>affection the one with the other. I would fain have<br/>it a match, and I doubt not but to fashion it, if<br/>you three will but minister such assistance as I<br/>shall give you direction.<br/><br/><br/>LEONATO<br/><br/><br/>
