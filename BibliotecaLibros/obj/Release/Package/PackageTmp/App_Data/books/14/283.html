<br/><br/>BENEDICK<br/><br/><br/>Is Claudio thine enemy?<br/><br/><br/>BEATRICE<br/><br/><br/>Is he not approved in the height a villain, that<br/>hath slandered, scorned, dishonoured my kinswoman? O<br/>that I were a man! What, bear her in hand until they<br/>come to take hands; and then, with public<br/>accusation, uncovered slander, unmitigated rancour,<br/>â€”O God, that I were a man! I would eat his heart<br/>in the market-place.<br/><br/><br/>BENEDICK<br/>
