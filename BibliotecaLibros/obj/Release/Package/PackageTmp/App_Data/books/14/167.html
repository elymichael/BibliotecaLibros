<br/><br/>HERO<br/><br/><br/>Why, every day, to-morrow. Come, go in:<br/>I'll show thee some attires, and have thy counsel<br/>Which is the best to furnish me to-morrow.<br/><br/><br/>URSULA<br/><br/><br/>She's limed, I warrant you: we have caught her, madam.<br/><br/><br/>HERO<br/><br/><br/>If it proves so, then loving goes by haps:<br/>Some Cupid kills with arrows, some with traps.<br/>
