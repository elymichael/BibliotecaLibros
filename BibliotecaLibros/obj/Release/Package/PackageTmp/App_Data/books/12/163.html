Indeed, on a second glance, it seemed impossible to fancy that<br/>the body was in a natural position. But for some disarray (the<br/>work, perhaps, of the birds that had fed upon him or of the<br/>slow-growing creeper that had gradually enveloped his remains) the<br/>man lay perfectly straight—his feet pointing in one direction, his<br/>hands, raised above his head like a diver's, pointing directly in<br/>the opposite.<br/><br/>"I've taken a notion into my old numbskull," observed Silver.<br/>"Here's the compass; there's the tip-top p'int o' Skeleton Island,<br/>stickin' out like a tooth. Just take a bearing, will you, along the<br/>line of them bones."<br/><br/>It was done. The body pointed straight in the direction of the<br/>island, and the compass read duly E.S.E. and by E.<br/><br/>"I thought so," cried the cook; "this here is a p'inter. Right<br/>up there is our line for the Pole Star and the jolly dollars. But,<br/>by thunder! If it don't make me cold inside to think of Flint. This<br/>is one of his jokes, and no mistake. Him and these six was alone<br/>here; he killed 'em, every man; and this one he hauled here and<br/>laid down by compass, shiver my timbers! They're long bones, and<br/>the hair's been yellow. Aye, that would be Allardyce. You mind<br/>Allardyce, Tom Morgan?"<br/><br/>"Aye, aye," returned Morgan; "I mind him; he owed me money, he<br/>did, and took my knife ashore with him."<br/><br/>"Speaking of knives," said another, "why don't we find his'n<br/>lying round? Flint warn't the man to pick a seaman's pocket; and<br/>the birds, I guess, would leave it be."<br/><br/>"By the powers, and that's true!" cried Silver.<br/><br/>"There ain't a thing left here," said Merry, still feeling round<br/>among the bones; "not a copper doit nor a baccy box. It don't look<br/>nat'ral to me."<br/><br/>"No, by gum, it don't," agreed Silver; "not nat'ral, nor not<br/>nice, says you. Great guns! Messmates, but if Flint was living,<br/>this would be a hot spot for you and me. Six they were, and six are<br/>we; and bones is what they are now."<br/><br/>"I saw him dead with these here deadlights," said Morgan. "Billy<br/>took me in. There he laid, with penny-pieces on his eyes."<br/><br/>"Dead—aye, sure enough he's dead and gone below," said the<br/>fellow with the bandage; "but if ever sperrit walked, it would be<br/>Flint's. Dear heart, but he died bad, did Flint!"<br/>
