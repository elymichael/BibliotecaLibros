<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>4<br/>I<br/>Strike the Jolly Roger<br/><br/><br/>I<br/>had scarce gained<br/>a position on the bowsprit when the flying jib flapped and filled<br/>upon the other tack, with a report like a gun. The schooner<br/>trembled to her keel under the reverse, but next moment, the other<br/>sails still drawing, the jib flapped back again and hung idle.<br/><br/>This had nearly tossed me off into the sea; and now I lost no<br/>time, crawled back along the bowsprit, and tumbled head foremost on<br/>the deck.<br/><br/>I was on the lee side of the forecastle, and the main-sail,<br/>which was still drawing, concealed from me a certain portion of the<br/>after-deck. Not a soul was to be seen. The planks, which had not<br/>been swabbed since the mutiny, bore the print of many feet, and an<br/>empty bottle, broken by the neck, tumbled to and fro like a live<br/>thing in the scuppers.<br/><br/>Suddenly the Hispaniola came right into the wind. The jibs<br/>behind me cracked aloud, the rudder slammed to, the whole ship gave<br/>a sickening heave and shudder, and at the same moment the main-boom<br/>swung inboard, the sheet groaning in the blocks, and showed me the<br/>lee after-deck.<br/><br/>There were the two watchmen, sure enough: red-cap on his back,<br/>as stiff as a handspike, with his arms stretched out like those of<br/>a crucifix and his teeth showing through his open lips; Israel<br/>Hands propped against the bulwarks, his chin on his chest, his<br/>hands lying open before him on the deck, his face as white, under<br/>its tan, as a tallow candle.<br/><br/>For a while the ship kept bucking and sidling like a vicious<br/>horse, the sails filling, now on one tack, now on another, and the<br/>boom swinging to and fro till the mast groaned aloud under the<br/>strain. Now and again too there would come a cloud of light sprays<br/>over the bulwark and a heavy blow of the ship's bows against the<br/>swell; so much heavier weather was made of it by this great rigged<br/>ship than by my home-made, lop-sided coracle, now gone to the<br/>bottom of the sea.<br/><br/>
