<br/>The man whom he called Morgan—an old, grey-haired,<br/>mahogany-faced sailor—came forward pretty sheepishly, rolling his<br/>quid.<br/><br/>"Now, Morgan," said Long John very sternly, "you never clapped<br/>your eyes on that Black—Black Dog before, did you, now?"<br/><br/>"Not I, sir," said Morgan with a salute.<br/><br/>"You didn't know his name, did you?"<br/><br/>"No, sir."<br/><br/>"By the powers, Tom Morgan, it's as good for you!" exclaimed the<br/>landlord. "If you had been mixed up with the like of that, you<br/>would never have put another foot in my house, you may lay to that.<br/>And what was he saying to you?"<br/><br/>"I don't rightly know, sir," answered Morgan.<br/><br/>"Do you call that a head on your shoulders, or a blessed<br/>dead-eye?" cried Long John. "Don't rightly know, don't you! Perhaps<br/>you don't happen to rightly know who you was speaking to, perhaps?<br/>Come, now, what was he jawing—v'yages, cap'ns, ships? Pipe up! What<br/>was it?"<br/><br/>"We was a-talkin' of keel-hauling," answered Morgan.<br/><br/>"Keel-hauling, was you? And a mighty suitable thing, too, and<br/>you may lay to that. Get back to your place for a lubber, Tom."<br/><br/>
