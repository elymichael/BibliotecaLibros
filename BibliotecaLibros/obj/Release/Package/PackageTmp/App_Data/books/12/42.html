"Mr. Silver, sir?" I asked, holding out the note.<br/><br/>"Yes, my lad," said he; "such is my name, to be sure. And who<br/>may you be?" And then as he saw the squire's letter, he seemed to<br/>me to give something almost like a start.<br/><br/>"Oh!" said he, quite loud, and offering his hand. "I see. You<br/>are our new cabin-boy; pleased I am to see you."<br/><br/>And he took my hand in his large firm grasp.<br/><br/>Just then one of the customers at the far side rose suddenly and<br/>made for the door. It was close by him, and he was out in the<br/>street in a moment. But his hurry had attracted my notice, and I<br/>recognized him at glance. It was the tallow-faced man, wanting two<br/>fingers, who had come first to the Admiral Benbow.<br/><br/>"Oh," I cried, "stop him! It's Black Dog!"<br/><br/>"I don't care two coppers who he is," cried Silver. "But he<br/>hasn't paid his score. Harry, run and catch him."<br/><br/>One of the others who was nearest the door leaped up and started<br/>in pursuit.<br/><br/>"If he were Admiral Hawke he shall pay his score," cried Silver;<br/>and then, relinquishing my hand, "Who did you say he was?" he<br/>asked. "Black what?"<br/><br/>"Dog, sir," said I. Has Mr. Trelawney not told you of the<br/>buccaneers? He was one of them."<br/><br/>"So?" cried Silver. "In my house! Ben, run and help Harry. One<br/>of those swabs, was he? Was that you drinking with him, Morgan?<br/>Step up here."<br/>
