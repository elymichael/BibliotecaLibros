It was no wonder the men were in a good humour now. For my part,<br/>I was horribly cast down. Should the scheme he had now sketched<br/>prove feasible, Silver, already doubly a traitor, would not<br/>hesitate to adopt it. He had still a foot in either camp, and there<br/>was no doubt he would prefer wealth and freedom with the pirates to<br/>a bare escape from hanging, which was the best he had to hope on<br/>our side.<br/><br/>Nay, and even if things so fell out that he was forced to keep<br/>his faith with Dr. Livesey, even then what danger lay before us!<br/>What a moment that would be when the suspicions of his followers<br/>turned to certainty and he and I should have to fight for dear<br/>life—he a cripple and I a boy—against five strong and active<br/>seamen!<br/><br/>Add to this double apprehension the mystery that still hung over<br/>the behaviour of my friends, their unexplained desertion of the<br/>stockade, their inexplicable cession of the chart, or harder still<br/>to understand, the doctor's last warning to Silver, "Look out for<br/>squalls when you find it," and you will readily believe how little<br/>taste I found in my breakfast and with how uneasy a heart I set<br/>forth behind my captors on the quest for treasure.<br/><br/>We made a curious figure, had anyone been there to see us—all in<br/>soiled sailor clothes and all but me armed to the teeth. Silver had<br/>two guns slung about him—one before and one behind—besides the<br/>great cutlass at his waist and a pistol in each pocket of his<br/>square-tailed coat. To complete his strange appearance, Captain<br/>Flint sat perched upon his shoulder and gabbling odds and ends of<br/>purposeless sea-talk. I had a line about my waist and followed<br/>obediently after the sea-cook, who held the loose end of the rope,<br/>now in his free hand, now between his powerful teeth. For all the<br/>world, I was led like a dancing bear.<br/><br/>The other men were variously burthened, some carrying picks and<br/>shovels—for that had been the very first necessary they brought<br/>ashore from the Hispaniola—others laden with pork, bread, and<br/>brandy for the midday meal. All the stores, I observed, came from<br/>our stock, and I could see the truth of Silver's words the night<br/>before. Had he not struck a bargain with the doctor, he and his<br/>mutineers, deserted by the ship, must have been driven to subsist<br/>on clear water and the proceeds of their hunting. Water would have<br/>been little to their taste; a sailor is not usually a good shot;<br/>and besides all that, when they were so short of eatables, it was<br/>not likely they would be very flush of powder.<br/><br/>Well, thus equipped, we all set out—even the fellow with the<br/>broken head, who should certainly have kept in shadow—and<br/>straggled, one after another, to the beach, where the two gigs<br/>awaited us. Even these bore trace of the drunken folly of the<br/>pirates, one in a broken thwart, and both in their muddy and<br/>unbailed condition. Both were to be carried along with us for the<br/>sake of safety; and so, with our numbers divided between them, we<br/>set forth upon the bosom of the anchorage.<br/><br/>As we pulled over, there was some discussion on the chart. The<br/>red cross was, of course, far too large to be a guide; and the<br/>terms of the note on the back, as you will hear, admitted of some<br/>ambiguity. They ran, the reader may remember, thus:<br/><br/>Tall tree, Spy-glass shoulder, bearing a point to<br/><br/>the N. of N.N.E.<br/><br/>Skeleton Island E.S.E. and by E.<br/><br/>Ten feet.<br/>
