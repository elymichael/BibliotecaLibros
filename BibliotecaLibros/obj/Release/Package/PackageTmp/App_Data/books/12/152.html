"Yes," said one, "that's Flint, sure enough. J. F., and a score<br/>below, with a clove hitch to it; so he done ever."<br/><br/>"Mighty pretty," said George. "But how are we to get away with<br/>it, and us no ship."<br/><br/>Silver suddenly sprang up, and supporting himself with a hand<br/>against the wall: "Now I give you warning, George," he cried. "One<br/>more word of your sauce, and I'll call you down and fight you. How?<br/>Why, how do I know?
