<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>6<br/>Council of War<br/><br/><br/>T<br/>here was a great<br/>rush of feet across the deck. I could hear people tumbling up from<br/>the cabin and the forecastle, and slipping in an instant outside my<br/>barrel, I dived behind the fore-sail, made a double towards the<br/>stern, and came out upon the open deck in time to join Hunter and<br/>Dr. Livesey in the rush for the weather bow.<br/><br/>There all hands were already congregated. A belt of fog had<br/>lifted almost simultaneously with the appearance of the moon. Away<br/>to the south-west of us we saw two low hills, about a couple of<br/>miles apart, and rising behind one of them a third and higher hill,<br/>whose peak was still buried in the fog. All three seemed sharp and<br/>conical in figure.<br/><br/>So much I saw, almost in a dream, for I had not yet recovered<br/>from my horrid fear of a minute or two before. And then I heard the<br/>voice of Captain Smollett issuing orders. The Hispaniola was laid a<br/>couple of points nearer the wind and now sailed a course that would<br/>just clear the island on the east.<br/><br/>"And now, men," said the captain, when all was sheeted home,<br/>"has any one of you ever seen that land ahead?"<br/><br/>"I have, sir," said Silver. "I've watered there with a trader I<br/>was cook in."<br/><br/>"The anchorage is on the south, behind an islet, I fancy?" asked<br/>the captain.<br/><br/>
