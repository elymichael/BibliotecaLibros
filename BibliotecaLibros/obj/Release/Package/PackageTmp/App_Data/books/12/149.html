<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>2<br/>The Black Spot Again<br/><br/><br/>T<br/>he council of<br/>buccaneers had lasted some time, when one of them re-entered the<br/>house, and with a repetition of the same salute, which had in my<br/>eyes an ironical air, begged for a moment's loan of the torch.<br/>Silver briefly agreed, and this emissary retired again, leaving us<br/>together in the dark.<br/><br/>"There's a breeze coming, Jim," said Silver, who had by this<br/>time adopted quite a friendly and familiar tone.<br/><br/>I turned to the loophole nearest me and looked out. The embers<br/>of the great fire had so far burned themselves out and now glowed<br/>so low and duskily that I understood why these conspirators desired<br/>a torch. About half-way down the slope to the stockade, they were<br/>collected in a group; one held the light, another was on his knees<br/>in their midst, and I saw the blade of an open knife shine in his<br/>hand with varying colours in the moon and torchlight. The rest were<br/>all somewhat stooping, as though watching the manoeuvres of this<br/>last. I could just make out that he had a book as well as a knife<br/>in his hand, and was still wondering how anything so incongruous<br/>had come in their possession when the kneeling figure rose once<br/>more to his feet and the whole party began to move together towards<br/>the house.<br/><br/>"Here they come," said I; and I returned to my former position,<br/>for it seemed beneath my dignity that they should find me watching<br/>them.<br/><br/>"Well, let 'em come, ladâ€”let 'em come," said Silver cheerily.<br/>"I've still a shot in my locker."<br/><br/>The door opened, and the five men, standing huddled together<br/>just inside, pushed one of their number forward. In any other<br/>circumstances it would have been comical to see his slow advance,<br/>hesitating as he set down each foot, but holding his closed right<br/>hand in front of him.<br/><br/>
