<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>3<br/>On<br/>Parole<br/><br/><br/>I<br/>was<br/>wakened—indeed, we were all wakened, for I could see even the<br/>sentinel shake himself together from where he had fallen against<br/>the door-post—by a clear, hearty voice hailing us from the margin<br/>of the wood:<br/><br/>"Block house, ahoy!" it cried. "Here's the doctor."<br/><br/>And the doctor it was. Although I was glad to hear the sound,<br/>yet my gladness was not without admixture. I remembered with<br/>confusion my insubordinate and stealthy conduct, and when I saw<br/>where it had brought me—among what companions and surrounded by<br/>what dangers—I felt ashamed to look him in the face.<br/><br/>He must have risen in the dark, for the day had hardly come; and<br/>when I ran to a loophole and looked out, I saw him standing, like<br/>Silver once before, up to the mid-leg in creeping vapour.<br/><br/>"You, doctor! Top o' the morning to you, sir!" cried Silver,<br/>broad awake and beaming with good nature in a moment. "Bright and<br/>early, to be sure; and it's the early bird, as the saying goes,<br/>that gets the rations. George, shake up your timbers, son, and help<br/>Dr. Livesey over the ship's side. All a-doin' well, your patients<br/>was—all well and merry."<br/><br/>So he pattered on, standing on the hilltop with his crutch under<br/>his elbow and one hand upon the side of the log-house—quite the old<br/>John in voice, manner, and expression.<br/><br/>
