Powder and Arms


T
he Hispaniola lay
some way out, and we went under the figureheads and round the
sterns of many other ships, and their cables sometimes grated
underneath our keel, and sometimes swung above us. At last,
however, we got alongside, and were met and saluted as we stepped
aboard by the mate, Mr. Arrow, a brown old sailor with earrings in
his ears and a squint. He and the squire were very thick and
friendly, but I soon observed that things were not the same between
Mr. Trelawney and the captain.

This last was a sharp-looking man who seemed angry with
everything on board and was soon to tell us why, for we had hardly
got down into the cabin when a sailor followed us.

"Captain Smollett, sir, axing to speak with you," said he.

"I am always at the captain's orders. Show him in," said the
squire.

The captain, who was close behind his messenger, entered at once
and shut the door behind him.

"Well, Captain Smollett, what have you to say? All well, I hope;
all shipshape and seaworthy?"
