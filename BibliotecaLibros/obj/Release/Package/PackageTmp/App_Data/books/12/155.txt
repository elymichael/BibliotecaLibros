"We've quite a surprise for you too, sir," he continued. "We've
a little stranger here—he! he! A noo boarder and lodger, sir, and
looking fit and taut as a fiddle; slep' like a supercargo, he did,
right alongside of John—stem to stem we was, all night."

Dr. Livesey was by this time across the stockade and pretty near
the cook, and I could hear the alteration in his voice as he said,
"Not Jim?"

"The very same Jim as ever was," says Silver.

The doctor stopped outright, although he did not speak, and it
was some seconds before he seemed able to move on.

"Well, well," he said at last, "duty first and pleasure
afterwards, as you might have said yourself, Silver. Let us
overhaul these patients of yours."

A moment afterwards he had entered the block house and with one
grim nod to me proceeded with his work among the sick. He seemed
under no apprehension, though he must have known that his life,
among these treacherous demons, depended on a hair; and he rattled
on to his patients as if he were paying an ordinary professional
visit in a quiet English family. His manner, I suppose, reacted on
the men, for they behaved to him as if nothing had occurred, as if
he were still ship's doctor and they still faithful hands before
the mast.

"You're doing well, my friend," he said to the fellow with the
bandaged head, "and if ever any person had a close shave, it was
you; your head must be as hard as iron. Well, George, how goes it?
You're a pretty colour, certainly; why, your liver, man, is upside
down. Did you take that medicine? Did he take that medicine,
men?"

"Aye, aye, sir, he took it, sure enough," returned Morgan.

"Because, you see, since I am mutineers' doctor, or prison
doctor as I prefer to call it," says Doctor Livesey in his
pleasantest way, "I make it a point of honour not to lose a man for
King George (God bless him!) and the gallows."

The rogues looked at each other but swallowed the home-thrust in
silence.

"Dick don't feel well, sir," said one.
