Nor had we much time left to us for thought. Suddenly, with a<br/>loud huzza, a little cloud of pirates leaped from the woods on the<br/>north side and ran straight on the stockade. At the same moment,<br/>the fire was once more opened from the woods, and a rifle ball sang<br/>through the doorway and knocked the doctor's musket into bits.<br/><br/>The boarders swarmed over the fence like monkeys. Squire and<br/>Gray fired again and yet again; three men fell, one forwards into<br/>the enclosure, two back on the outside. But of these, one was<br/>evidently more frightened than hurt, for he was on his feet again<br/>in a crack and instantly disappeared among the trees.<br/><br/>Two had bit the dust, one had fled, four had made good their<br/>footing inside our defences, while from the shelter of the woods<br/>seven or eight men, each evidently supplied with several muskets,<br/>kept up a hot though useless fire on the log-house.<br/><br/>The four who had boarded made straight before them for the<br/>building, shouting as they ran, and the men among the trees shouted<br/>back to encourage them. Several shots were fired, but such was the<br/>hurry of the marksmen that not one appears to have taken effect. In<br/>a moment, the four pirates had swarmed up the mound and were upon<br/>us.<br/><br/>The head of Job Anderson, the boatswain, appeared at the middle<br/>loophole.<br/><br/>"At 'em, all handsâ€”all hands!" he roared in a voice of<br/>thunder.<br/><br/>At the same moment, another pirate grasped Hunter's musket by<br/>the muzzle, wrenched it from his hands, plucked it through the<br/>loophole, and with one stunning blow, laid the poor fellow<br/>senseless on the floor. Meanwhile a third, running unharmed all<br/>around the house, appeared suddenly in the doorway and fell with<br/>his cutlass on the doctor.<br/><br/>Our position was utterly reversed. A moment since we were<br/>firing, under cover, at an exposed enemy; now it was we who lay<br/>uncovered and could not return a blow.<br/><br/>The log-house was full of smoke, to which we owed our<br/>comparative safety. Cries and confusion, the flashes and reports of<br/>pistol-shots, and one loud groan rang in my ears.<br/><br/>"Out, lads, out, and fight 'em in the open! Cutlasses!" cried<br/>the captain.<br/><br/>I snatched a cutlass from the pile, and someone, at the same<br/>time snatching another, gave me a cut across the knuckles which I<br/>hardly felt. I dashed out of the door into the clear sunlight.<br/>Someone was close behind, I knew not whom. Right in front, the<br/>doctor was pursuing his assailant down the hill, and just as my<br/>eyes fell upon him, beat down his guard and sent him sprawling on<br/>his back with a great slash across the face.<br/>
