On
Parole


I
was
wakened—indeed, we were all wakened, for I could see even the
sentinel shake himself together from where he had fallen against
the door-post—by a clear, hearty voice hailing us from the margin
of the wood:

"Block house, ahoy!" it cried. "Here's the doctor."

And the doctor it was. Although I was glad to hear the sound,
yet my gladness was not without admixture. I remembered with
confusion my insubordinate and stealthy conduct, and when I saw
where it had brought me—among what companions and surrounded by
what dangers—I felt ashamed to look him in the face.

He must have risen in the dark, for the day had hardly come; and
when I ran to a loophole and looked out, I saw him standing, like
Silver once before, up to the mid-leg in creeping vapour.

"You, doctor! Top o' the morning to you, sir!" cried Silver,
broad awake and beaming with good nature in a moment. "Bright and
early, to be sure; and it's the early bird, as the saying goes,
that gets the rations. George, shake up your timbers, son, and help
Dr. Livesey over the ship's side. All a-doin' well, your patients
was—all well and merry."

So he pattered on, standing on the hilltop with his crutch under
his elbow and one hand upon the side of the log-house—quite the old
John in voice, manner, and expression.
