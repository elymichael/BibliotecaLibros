To all this, as may be well supposed, I made no answer. They had<br/>set me with my back against the wall, and I stood there, looking<br/>Silver in the face, pluckily enough, I hope, to all outward<br/>appearance, but with black despair in my heart.<br/><br/>Silver took a whiff or two of his pipe with great composure and<br/>then ran on again.<br/><br/>"Now, you see, Jim, so be as you are here," says he, "I'll give<br/>you a piece of my mind. I've always liked you, I have, for a lad of<br/>spirit, and the picter of my own self when I was young and<br/>handsome. I always wanted you to jine and take your share, and die<br/>a gentleman, and now, my cock, you've got to. Cap'n Smollett's a<br/>fine seaman, as I'll own up to any day, but stiff on discipline.<br/>'Dooty is dooty,' says he, and right he is. Just you keep clear of<br/>the cap'n. The doctor himself is gone dead again you—'ungrateful<br/>scamp' was what he said; and the short and the long of the whole<br/>story is about here: you can't go back to your own lot, for they<br/>won't have you; and without you start a third ship's company all by<br/>yourself, which might be lonely, you'll have to jine with Cap'n<br/>Silver."<br/><br/>So far so good. My friends, then, were still alive, and though I<br/>partly believed the truth of Silver's statement, that the cabin<br/>party were incensed at me for my desertion, I was more relieved<br/>than distressed by what I heard.<br/><br/>"I don't say nothing as to your being in our hands," continued<br/>Silver, "though there you are, and you may lay to it. I'm all for<br/>argyment; I never seen good come out o' threatening. If you like<br/>the service, well, you'll jine; and if you don't, Jim, why, you're<br/>free to answer no—free and welcome, shipmate; and if fairer can be<br/>said by mortal seaman, shiver my sides!"<br/><br/>"Am I to answer, then?" I asked with a very tremulous voice.<br/>Through all this sneering talk, I was made to feel the threat of<br/>death that overhung me, and my cheeks burned and my heart beat<br/>painfully in my breast.<br/><br/>"Lad," said Silver, "no one's a-pressing of you. Take your<br/>bearings. None of us won't hurry you, mate; time goes so pleasant<br/>in your company, you see."<br/><br/>"Well," says I, growing a bit bolder, "if I'm to choose, I<br/>declare I have a right to know what's what, and why you're here,<br/>and where my friends are."<br/><br/>"Wot's wot?" repeated one of the buccaneers in a deep growl.<br/>"Ah, he'd be a lucky one as knowed that!"<br/><br/>"You'll perhaps batten down your hatches till you're spoke to,<br/>my friend," cried Silver truculently to this speaker. And then, in<br/>his first gracious tones, he replied to me, "Yesterday morning, Mr.<br/>Hawkins," said he, "in the dog-watch, down came Doctor Livesey with<br/>a flag of truce. Says he, 'Cap'n Silver, you're sold out. Ship's<br/>gone.' Well, maybe we'd been taking a glass, and a song to help it<br/>round. I won't say no. Leastways, none of us had looked out. We<br/>looked out, and by thunder, the old ship was gone! I never seen a<br/>pack o' fools look fishier; and you may lay to that, if I tells you<br/>that looked the fishiest. 'Well,' says the doctor, 'let's bargain.'<br/>We bargained, him and I, and here we are: stores, brandy, block<br/>house, the firewood you was thoughtful enough to cut, and in a<br/>manner of speaking, the whole blessed boat, from cross-trees to<br/>kelson. As for them, they've tramped; I don't know where's they<br/>are."<br/><br/>He drew again quietly at his pipe.<br/>
