<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>1<br/>I<br/>Go to Bristol<br/><br/><br/>I<br/>t was longer than<br/>the squire imagined ere we were ready for the sea, and none of our<br/>first plans—not even Dr. Livesey's, of keeping me beside him—could<br/>be carried out as we intended. The doctor had to go to London for a<br/>physician to take charge of his practice; the squire was hard at<br/>work at Bristol; and I lived on at the hall under the charge of old<br/>Redruth, the gamekeeper, almost a prisoner, but full of sea-dreams<br/>and the most charming anticipations of strange islands and<br/>adventures. I brooded by the hour together over the map, all the<br/>details of which I well remembered. Sitting by the fire in the<br/>housekeeper's room, I approached that island in my fancy from every<br/>possible direction; I explored every acre of its surface; I climbed<br/>a thousand times to that tall hill they call the Spy-glass, and<br/>from the top enjoyed the most wonderful and changing prospects.<br/>Sometimes the isle was thick with savages, with whom we fought,<br/>sometimes full of dangerous animals that hunted us, but in all my<br/>fancies nothing occurred to me so strange and tragic as our actual<br/>adventures.<br/><br/>So the weeks passed on, till one fine day there came a letter<br/>addressed to Dr. Livesey, with this addition, "To be opened, in the<br/>case of his absence, by Tom Redruth or young Hawkins." Obeying this<br/>order, we found, or rather I found—for the gamekeeper was a poor<br/>hand at reading anything but print—the following important<br/>news:<br/><br/><br/>Old Anchor Inn, Bristol, March 1, 17—<br/><br/>Dear Livesey—As I do not know whether you&#160;are at the hall<br/>or still in London, I send this in&#160;double to both places.<br/><br/>The ship is bought and fitted. She lies at&#160;anchor, ready<br/>for sea. You never imagined a&#160;sweeter schooner—a child might<br/>sail her—two&#160;hundred tons; name, Hispaniola.<br/><br/>I got her through my old friend, Blandly, who&#160;has proved<br/>himself throughout the most surprising&#160;trump. The admirable<br/>fellow literally slaved in&#160;my interest, and so, I may say, did<br/>everyone in&#160;Bristol, as soon as they got wind of the port<br/>we&#160;sailed for—treasure, I mean.<br/>
