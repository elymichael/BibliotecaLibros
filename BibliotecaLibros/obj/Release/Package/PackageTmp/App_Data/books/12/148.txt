He hobbled to the torch, where it stood propped among the
firewood, and took a fresh light to his pipe.

"Understand me, Jim," he said, returning. "I've a head on my
shoulders, I have. I'm on squire's side now. I know you've got that
ship safe somewheres. How you done it, I don't know, but safe it
is. I guess Hands and O'Brien turned soft. I never much believed in
neither of them. Now you mark me. I ask no questions, nor I won't
let others. I know when a game's up, I do; and I know a lad that's
staunch. Ah, you that's young—you and me might have done a power of
good together!"

He drew some cognac from the cask into a tin cannikin.

"Will you taste, messmate?" he asked; and when I had refused:
"Well, I'll take a drain myself, Jim," said he. "I need a caulker,
for there's trouble on hand. And talking o' trouble, why did that
doctor give me the chart, Jim?"

My face expressed a wonder so unaffected that he saw the
needlessness of further questions.

"Ah, well, he did, though," said he. "And there's something
under that, no doubt—something, surely, under that, Jim—bad or
good."

And he took another swallow of the brandy, shaking his great
fair head like a man who looks forward to the worst.
