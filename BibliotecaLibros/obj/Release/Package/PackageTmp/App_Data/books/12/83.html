<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>1<br/>Narrative Continued by the Doctor: How the Ship Was Abandoned<br/><br/><br/>I<br/>t was about half<br/>past one—three bells in the sea phrase—that the two boats went<br/>ashore from the Hispaniola. The captain, the squire, and I were<br/>talking matters over in the cabin. Had there been a breath of wind,<br/>we should have fallen on the six mutineers who were left aboard<br/>with us, slipped our cable, and away to sea. But the wind was<br/>wanting; and to complete our helplessness, down came Hunter with<br/>the news that Jim Hawkins had slipped into a boat and was gone<br/>ashore with the rest.<br/><br/>It never occurred to us to doubt Jim Hawkins, but we were<br/>alarmed for his safety. With the men in the temper they were in, it<br/>seemed an even chance if we should see the lad again. We ran on<br/>deck. The pitch was bubbling in the seams; the nasty stench of the<br/>place turned me sick; if ever a man smelt fever and dysentery, it<br/>was in that abominable anchorage. The six scoundrels were sitting<br/>grumbling under a sail in the forecastle; ashore we could see the<br/>gigs made fast and a man sitting in each, hard by where the river<br/>runs in. One of them was whistling "Lillibullero."<br/><br/>Waiting was a strain, and it was decided that Hunter and I<br/>should go ashore with the jolly-boat in quest of information. The<br/>gigs had leaned to their right, but Hunter and I pulled straight<br/>in, in the direction of the stockade upon the chart. The two who<br/>were left guarding their boats seemed in a bustle at our<br/>appearance; "Lillibullero" stopped off, and I could see the pair<br/>discussing what they ought to do. Had they gone and told Silver,<br/>all might have turned out differently; but they had their orders, I<br/>suppose, and decided to sit quietly where they were and hark back<br/>again to "Lillibullero."<br/><br/>There was a slight bend in the coast, and I steered so as to put<br/>it between us; even before we landed we had thus lost sight of the<br/>gigs. I jumped out and came as near running as I durst, with a big<br/>silk handkerchief under my hat for coolness' sake and a brace of<br/>pistols ready primed for safety.<br/><br/>I had not gone a hundred yards when I reached the stockade.<br/><br/>This was how it was: a spring of clear water rose almost at the<br/>top of a knoll. Well, on the knoll, and enclosing the spring, they<br/>had clapped a stout log-house fit to hold two score of people on a<br/>pinch and loopholed for musketry on either side. All round this<br/>they had cleared a wide space, and then the thing was completed by<br/>a paling six feet high, without door or opening, too strong to pull<br/>down without time and labour and too open to shelter the besiegers.<br/>The people in the log-house had them in every way; they stood quiet<br/>in shelter and shot the others like partridges. All they wanted was<br/>a good watch and food; for, short of a complete surprise, they<br/>might have held the place against a regiment.<br/><br/>
