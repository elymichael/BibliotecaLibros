"Sir," said Silver, "as between man and man, that's too much and
too little. What you're after, why you left the block house, why
you given me that there chart, I don't know, now, do I? And yet I
done your bidding with my eyes shut and never a word of hope! But
no, this here's too much. If you won't tell me what you mean plain
out, just say so and I'll leave the helm."

"No," said the doctor musingly; "I've no right to say more; it's
not my secret, you see, Silver, or, I give you my word, I'd tell it
you. But I'll go as far with you as I dare go, and a step beyond,
for I'll have my wig sorted by the captain or I'm mistaken! And
first, I'll give you a bit of hope; Silver, if we both get alive
out of this wolf-trap, I'll do my best to save you, short of
perjury."

Silver's face was radiant. "You couldn't say more, I'm sure,
sir, not if you was my mother," he cried.

"Well, that's my first concession," added the doctor. "My second
is a piece of advice: keep the boy close beside you, and when you
need help, halloo. I'm off to seek it for you, and that itself will
show you if I speak at random. Good-bye, Jim."

And Dr. Livesey shook hand s with me through the stockade,
nodded to Silver, and set off at a brisk pace into the wood.
