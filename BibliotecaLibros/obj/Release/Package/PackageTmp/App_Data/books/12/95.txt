Just then, with a roar and a whistle, a round-shot passed high
above the roof of the log-house and plumped far beyond us in the
wood.

"Oho!" said the captain. "Blaze away! You've little enough
powder already, my lads."

At the second trial, the aim was better, and the ball descended
inside the stockade, scattering a cloud of sand but doing no
further damage.

"Captain," said the squire, "the house is quite invisible from
the ship. It must be the flag they are aiming at. Would it not be
wiser to take it in?"

"Strike my colours!" cried the captain. "No, sir, not I"; and as
soon as he had said the words, I think we all agreed with him. For
it was not only a piece of stout, seamanly, good feeling; it was
good policy besides and showed our enemies that we despised their
cannonade.

All through the evening they kept thundering away. Ball after
ball flew over or fell short or kicked up the sand in the
enclosure, but they had to fire so high that the shot fell dead and
buried itself in the soft sand. We had no ricochet to fear, and
though one popped in through the roof of the log-house and out
again through the floor, we soon got used to that sort of
horse-play and minded it no more than cricket.

"There is one good thing about all this," observed the captain;
"the wood in front of us is likely clear. The ebb has made a good
while; our stores should be uncovered. Volunteers to go and bring
in pork.

Gray and hunter were the first to come forward. Well armed, they
stole out of the stockade, but it proved a useless mission. The
mutineers were bolder than we fancied or they put more trust in
Israel's gunnery. For four or five of them were busy carrying off
our stores and wading out with them to one of the gigs that lay
close by, pulling an oar or so to hold her steady against the
current. Silver was in the stern-sheets in command; and every man
of them was now provided with a musket from some secret magazine of
their own.

The captain sat down to his log, and here is the beginning of
the entry:


Alexander Smollett, master;
