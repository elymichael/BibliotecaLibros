He watched me keenly and slyly, his chin all the while on his<br/>breast.<br/><br/>"I reckon," he said at last, "I reckon, Cap'n Hawkins, you'll<br/>kind of want to get ashore now. S'pose we talks."<br/><br/>"Why, yes," says I, "with all my heart, Mr. Hands. Say on." And<br/>I went back to my meal with a good appetite.<br/><br/>"This man," he began, nodding feebly at the corpse "—O'Brien<br/>were his name, a rank Irelander—this man and me got the canvas on<br/>her, meaning for to sail her back. Well, he's dead now, he is—as<br/>dead as bilge; and who's to sail this ship, I don't see. Without I<br/>gives you a hint, you ain't that man, as far's I can tell. Now,<br/>look here, you gives me food and drink and a old scarf or ankecher<br/>to tie my wound up, you do, and I'll tell you how to tail her, and<br/>that's about square all round, I take it."<br/><br/>"I'll tell you one thing," says I: "I'm not going back to<br/>Captain Kidd's anchorage. I mean to get into North Inlet and beach<br/>her quietly there."<br/><br/>"To be sure you did," he cried. "Why, I ain't sich an infernal<br/>lubber after all. I can see, can't I? I've tried my fling, I have,<br/>and I've lost, and it's you has the wind of me. North Inlet? Why, I<br/>haven't no ch'ice, not I! I'd help you sail her up to Execution<br/>Dock, by thunder! So I would."<br/><br/>Well, as it seemed to me, there was some sense in this. We<br/>struck our bargain on the spot. In three minutes I had the<br/>Hispaniola sailing easily before the wind along the coast of<br/>Treasure Island, with good hopes of turning the northern point ere<br/>noon and beating down again as far as North Inlet before high<br/>water, when we might beach her safely and wait till the subsiding<br/>tide permitted us to land.<br/><br/>Then I lashed the tiller and went below to my own chest, where I<br/>got a soft silk handkerchief of my mother's. With this, and with my<br/>aid, Hands bound up the great bleeding stab he had received in the<br/>thigh, and after he had eaten a little and had a swallow or two<br/>more of the brandy, he began to pick up visibly, sat straighter up,<br/>spoke louder and clearer, and looked in every way another man.<br/><br/>The breeze served us admirably. We skimmed before it like a<br/>bird, the coast of the island flashing by and the view changing<br/>every minute. Soon we were past the high lands and bowling beside<br/>low, sandy country, sparsely dotted with dwarf pines, and soon we<br/>were beyond that again and had turned the corner of the rocky hill<br/>that ends the island on the north.<br/><br/>I was greatly elated with my new command, and pleased with the<br/>bright, sunshiny weather and these different prospects of the<br/>coast. I had now plenty of water and good things to eat, and my<br/>conscience, which had smitten me hard for my desertion, was quieted<br/>by the great conquest I had made. I should, I think, have had<br/>nothing left me to desire but for the eyes of the coxswain as they<br/>followed me derisively about the deck and the odd smile that<br/>appeared continually on his face. It was a smile that had in it<br/>something both of pain and weakness—a haggard old man's smile; but<br/>there was, besides that, a grain of derision, a shadow of<br/>treachery, in his expression as he craftily watched, and watched,<br/>and watched me at my work.<br/><br/><br/>
