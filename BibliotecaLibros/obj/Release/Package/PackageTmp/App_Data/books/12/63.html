"Yes, sir; Skeleton Island they calls it. It were a main place<br/>for pirates once, and a hand we had on board knowed all their names<br/>for it. That hill to the nor'ard they calls the Fore-mast Hill;<br/>there are three hills in a row running south'ard—fore, main, and<br/>mizzen, sir. But the main—that's the big un, with the cloud on<br/>it—they usually calls the Spy-glass, by reason of a lookout they<br/>kept when they was in the anchorage cleaning, for it's there they<br/>cleaned their ships, sir, asking your pardon."<br/><br/>"I have a chart here," says Captain Smollett. "See if that's the<br/>place."<br/><br/>Long John's eyes burned in his head as he took the chart, but by<br/>the fresh look of the paper I knew he was doomed to disappointment.<br/>This was not the map we found in Billy Bones's chest, but an<br/>accurate copy, complete in all things—names and heights and<br/>soundings—with the single exception of the red crosses and the<br/>written notes. Sharp as must have been his annoyance, Silver had<br/>the strength of mind to hide it.<br/><br/>"Yes, sir," said he, "this is the spot, to be sure, and very<br/>prettily drawed out. Who might have done that, I wonder? The<br/>pirates were too ignorant, I reckon. Aye, here it is: 'Capt. Kidd's<br/>Anchorage'—just the name my shipmate called it. There's a strong<br/>current runs along the south, and then away nor'ard up the west<br/>coast. Right you was, sir," says he, "to haul your wind and keep<br/>the weather of the island. Leastways, if such was your intention as<br/>to enter and careen, and there ain't no better place for that in<br/>these waters."<br/><br/>"Thank you, my man," says Captain Smollett. "I'll ask you later<br/>on to give us a help. You may go."<br/><br/>I was surprised at the coolness with which John avowed his<br/>knowledge of the island, and I own I was half-frightened when I saw<br/>him drawing nearer to myself. He did not know, to be sure, that I<br/>had overheard his council from the apple barrel, and yet I had by<br/>this time taken such a horror of his cruelty, duplicity, and power<br/>that I could scarce conceal a shudder when he laid his hand upon my<br/>arm.<br/><br/>"Ah," says he, "this here is a sweet spot, this island—a sweet<br/>spot for a lad to get ashore on. You'll bathe, and you'll climb<br/>trees, and you'll hunt goats, you will; and you'll get aloft on<br/>them hills like a goat yourself. Why, it makes me young again. I<br/>was going to forget my timber leg, I was. It's a pleasant thing to<br/>be young and have ten toes, and you may lay to that. When you want<br/>to go a bit of exploring, you just ask old John, and he'll put up a<br/>snack for you to take along."<br/><br/>And clapping me in the friendliest way upon the shoulder, he<br/>hobbled off forward and went below.<br/><br/>Captain Smollett, the squire, and Dr. Livesey were talking<br/>together on the quarter-deck, and anxious as I was to tell them my<br/>story, I durst not interrupt them openly. While I was still casting<br/>about in my thoughts to find some probable excuse, Dr. Livesey<br/>called me to his side. He had left his pipe below, and being a<br/>slave to tobacco, had meant that I should fetch it; but as soon as<br/>I was near enough to speak and not to be overheard, I broke<br/>immediately, "Doctor, let me speak. Get the captain and squire down<br/>to the cabin, and then make some pretence to send for me. I have<br/>terrible news."<br/><br/>The doctor changed countenance a little, but next moment he was<br/>master of himself.<br/><br/>"Thank you, Jim," said he quite loudly, "that was all I wanted<br/>to know," as if he had asked me a question.<br/>
