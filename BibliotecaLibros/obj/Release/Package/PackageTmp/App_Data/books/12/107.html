<br/>"Every last word, by thunder!" answered John. "Refuse that, and<br/>you've seen the last of me but musket-balls."<br/><br/>"Very good," said the captain. "Now you'll hear me. If you'll<br/>come up one by one, unarmed, I'll engage to clap you all in irons<br/>and take you home to a fair trial in England. If you won't, my name<br/>is Alexander Smollett, I've flown my sovereign's colours, and I'll<br/>see you all to Davy Jones. You can't find the treasure. You can't<br/>sail the ship—there's not a man among you fit to sail the ship. You<br/>can't fight us—Gray, there, got away from five of you. Your ship's<br/>in irons, Master Silver; you're on a lee shore, and so you'll find.<br/>I stand here and tell you so; and they're the last good words<br/>you'll get from me, for in the name of heaven, I'll put a bullet in<br/>your back when next I meet you. Tramp, my lad. Bundle out of this,<br/>please, hand over hand, and double quick."<br/><br/>Silver's face was a picture; his eyes started in his head with<br/>wrath. He shook the fire out of his pipe.<br/><br/>"Give me a hand up!" he cried.<br/><br/>"Not I," returned the captain.<br/><br/>"Who'll give me a hand up?" he roared.<br/><br/>Not a man among us moved. Growling the foulest imprecations, he<br/>crawled along the sand till he got hold of the porch and could<br/>hoist himself again upon his crutch. Then he spat into the<br/>spring.<br/><br/>"There!" he cried. "That's what I think of ye. Before an hour's<br/>out, I'll stove in your old block house like a rum puncheon. Laugh,<br/>by thunder, laugh! Before an hour's out, ye'll laugh upon the other<br/>side. Them that die'll be the lucky ones."<br/><br/>And with a dreadful oath he stumbled off, ploughed down the<br/>sand, was helped across the stockade, after four or five failures,<br/>by the man with the flag of truce, and disappeared in an instant<br/>afterwards among the trees.<br/><br/><br/><br/>
