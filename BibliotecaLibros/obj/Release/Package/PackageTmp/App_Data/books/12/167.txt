The buccaneers remained rooted to the ground, their eyes
starting from their heads. Long after the voice had died away they
still stared in silence, dreadfully, before them.

"That fixes it!" gasped one. "Let's go."

"They was his last words," moaned Morgan, "his last words above
board."

Dick had his Bible out and was praying volubly. He had been well
brought up, had Dick, before he came to sea and fell among bad
companions.

Still Silver was unconquered. I could hear his teeth rattle in
his head, but he had not yet surrendered.

"Nobody in this here island ever heard of Darby," he muttered;
"not one but us that's here." And then, making a great effort:
"Shipmates," he cried, "I'm here to get that stuff, and I'll not be
beat by man or devil. I never was feared of Flint in his life, and,
by the powers, I'll face him dead. There's seven hundred thousand
pound not a quarter of a mile from here. When did ever a gentleman
o' fortune show his stern to that much dollars for a boozy old
seaman with a blue mugâ€”and him dead too?"

But there was no sign of reawakening courage in his followers,
rather, indeed, of growing terror at the irreverence of his
words.

"Belay there, John!" said Merry. "Don't you cross a
sperrit."

And the rest were all too terrified to reply. They would have
run away severally had they dared; but fear kept them together, and
kept them close by John, as if his daring helped them. He, on his
part, had pretty well fought his weakness down.

"Sperrit? Well, maybe," he said. "But there's one thing not
clear to me. There was an echo. Now, no man ever seen a sperrit
with a shadow; well then, what's he doing with an echo to him, I
should like to know? That ain't in natur', surely?"
