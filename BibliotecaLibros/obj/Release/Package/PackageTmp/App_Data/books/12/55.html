<br/>"He's no common man, Barbecue," said the coxswain to me. "He had<br/>good schooling in his young days and can speak like a book when so<br/>minded; and brave—a lion's nothing alongside of Long John! I seen<br/>him grapple four and knock their heads together—him unarmed."<br/><br/>All the crew respected and even obeyed him. He had a way of<br/>talking to each and doing everybody some particular service. To me<br/>he was unweariedly kind, and always glad to see me in the galley,<br/>which he kept as clean as a new pin, the dishes hanging up<br/>burnished and his parrot in a cage in one corner.<br/><br/>"Come away, Hawkins," he would say; "come and have a yarn with<br/>John. Nobody more welcome than yourself, my son. Sit you down and<br/>hear the news. Here's Cap'n Flint—I calls my parrot Cap'n Flint,<br/>after the famous buccaneer—here's Cap'n Flint predicting success to<br/>our v'yage. Wasn't you, cap'n?"<br/><br/>And the parrot would say, with great rapidity, "Pieces of eight!<br/>Pieces of eight! Pieces of eight!" till you wondered that it was<br/>not out of breath, or till John threw his handkerchief over the<br/>cage.<br/><br/>"Now, that bird," he would say, "is, maybe, two hundred years<br/>old, Hawkins—they live forever mostly; and if anybody's seen more<br/>wickedness, it must be the devil himself. She's sailed with<br/>England, the great Cap'n England, the pirate. She's been at<br/>Madagascar, and at Malabar, and Surinam, and Providence, and<br/>Portobello. She was at the fishing up of the wrecked plate ships.<br/>It's there she learned 'Pieces of eight,' and little wonder; three<br/>hundred and fifty thousand of 'em, Hawkins! She was at the boarding<br/>of the viceroy of the Indies out of Goa, she was; and to look at<br/>her you would think she was a babby. But you smelt powder—didn't<br/>you, cap'n?"<br/><br/>"Stand by to go about," the parrot would scream.<br/><br/>"Ah, she's a handsome craft, she is," the cook would say, and<br/>give her sugar from his pocket, and then the bird would peck at the<br/>bars and swear straight on, passing belief for wickedness. "There,"<br/>John would add, "you can't touch pitch and not be mucked, lad.<br/>Here's this poor old innocent bird o' mine swearing blue fire, and<br/>none the wiser, you may lay to that. She would swear the same, in a<br/>manner of speaking, before chaplain." And John would touch his<br/>forelock with a solemn way he had that made me think he was the<br/>best of men.<br/><br/>In the meantime, the squire and Captain Smollett were still on<br/>pretty distant terms with one another. The squire made no bones<br/>about the matter; he despised the captain. The captain, on his<br/>part, never spoke but when he was spoken to, and then sharp and<br/>short and dry, and not a word wasted. He owned, when driven into a<br/>corner, that he seemed to have been wrong about the crew, that some<br/>of them were as brisk as he wanted to see and all had behaved<br/>fairly well. As for the ship, he had taken a downright fancy to<br/>her. "She'll lie a point nearer the wind than a man has a right to<br/>expect of his own married wife, sir. But," he would add, "all I say<br/>is, we're not home again, and I don't like the cruise."<br/><br/>The squire, at this, would turn away and march up and down the<br/>deck, chin in air.<br/><br/>"A trifle more of that man," he would say, "and I shall<br/>explode."<br/><br/>
