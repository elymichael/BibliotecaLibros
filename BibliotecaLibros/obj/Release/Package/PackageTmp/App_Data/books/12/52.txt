The cook came up the side like a monkey for cleverness, and as
soon as he saw what was doing, "So ho, mates!" says he. "What's
this?"

"We're a-changing of the powder, Jack," answers one.

"Why, by the powers," cried Long John, "if we do, we'll miss the
morning tide!"

"My orders!" said the captain shortly. "You may go below, my
man. Hands will want supper."

"Aye, aye, sir," answered the cook, and touching his forelock,
he disappeared at once in the direction of his galley. "That's a
good man, captain," said the doctor.

"Very likely, sir," replied Captain Smollett. "Easy with that,
menâ€”easy," he ran on, to the fellows who were shifting the powder;
and then suddenly observing me examining the swivel we carried
amidships, a long brass nine, "Here you, ship's boy," he cried,
"out o' that! Off with you to the cook and get some work."

And then as I was hurrying off I heard him say, quite loudly, to
the doctor, "I'll have no favourites on my ship." I assure you I
was quite of the squire's way of thinking, and hated the captain
deeply.
