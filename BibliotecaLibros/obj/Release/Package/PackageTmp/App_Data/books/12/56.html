We had some heavy weather, which only proved the qualities of<br/>the Hispaniola. Every man on board seemed well content, and they<br/>must have been hard to please if they had been otherwise, for it is<br/>my belief there was never a ship's company so spoiled since Noah<br/>put to sea. Double grog was going on the least excuse; there was<br/>duff on odd days, as, for instance, if the squire heard it was any<br/>man's birthday, and always a barrel of apples standing broached in<br/>the waist for anyone to help himself that had a fancy.<br/><br/>"Never knew good come of it yet," the captain said to Dr.<br/>Livesey. "Spoil forecastle hands, make devils. That's my belief."<br/>But good did come of the apple barrel, as you shall hear, for if it<br/>had not been for that, we should have had no note of warning and<br/>might all have perished by the hand of treachery.<br/><br/>This was how it came about.<br/><br/>We had run up the trades to get the wind of the island we were<br/>after—I am not allowed to be more plain—and now we were running<br/>down for it with a bright lookout day and night. It was about the<br/>last day of our outward voyage by the largest computation; some<br/>time that night, or at latest before noon of the morrow, we should<br/>sight the Treasure Island. We were heading S.S.W. and had a steady<br/>breeze abeam and a quiet sea. The Hispaniola rolled steadily,<br/>dipping her bowsprit now and then with a whiff of spray. All was<br/>drawing alow and aloft; everyone was in the bravest spirits because<br/>we were now so near an end of the first part of our adventure.<br/><br/>Now, just after sundown, when all my work was over and I was on<br/>my way to my berth, it occurred to me that I should like an apple.<br/>I ran on deck. The watch was all forward looking out for the<br/>island. The man at the helm was watching the luff of the sail and<br/>whistling away gently to himself, and that was the only sound<br/>excepting the swish of the sea against the bows and around the<br/>sides of the ship.<br/><br/>In I got bodily into the apple barrel, and found there was<br/>scarce an apple left; but sitting down there in the dark, what with<br/>the sound of the waters and the rocking movement of the ship, I had<br/>either fallen asleep or was on the point of doing so when a heavy<br/>man sat down with rather a clash close by. The barrel shook as he<br/>leaned his shoulders against it, and I was just about to jump up<br/>when the man began to speak. It was Silver's voice, and before I<br/>had heard a dozen words, I would not have shown myself for all the<br/>world, but lay there, trembling and listening, in the extreme of<br/>fear and curiosity, for from these dozen words I understood that<br/>the lives of all the honest men aboard depended upon me alone.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
