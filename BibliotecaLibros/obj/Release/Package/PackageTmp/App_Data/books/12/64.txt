And with that he turned on his heel and rejoined the other two.
They spoke together for a little, and though none of them started,
or raised his voice, or so much as whistled, it was plain enough
that Dr. Livesey had communicated my request, for the next thing
that I heard was the captain giving an order to Job Anderson, and
all hands were piped on deck.

"My lads," said Captain Smollett, "I've a word to say to you.
This land that we have sighted is the place we have been sailing
for. Mr. Trelawney, being a very open-handed gentleman, as we all
know, has just asked me a word or two, and as I was able to tell
him that every man on board had done his duty, alow and aloft, as I
never ask to see it done better, why, he and I and the doctor are
going below to the cabin to drink your health and luck, and you'll
have grog served out for you to drink our health and luck. I'll
tell you what I think of this: I think it handsome. And if you
think as I do, you'll give a good sea-cheer for the gentleman that
does it."

The cheer followed—that was a matter of course; but it rang out
so full and hearty that I confess I could hardly believe these same
men were plotting for our blood.

"One more cheer for Cap'n Smollett," cried Long John when the
first had subsided.

And this also was given with a will.

On the top of that the three gentlemen went below, and not long
after, word was sent forward that Jim Hawkins was wanted in the
cabin.

I found them all three seated round the table, a bottle of
Spanish wine and some raisins before them, and the doctor smoking
away, with his wig on his lap, and that, I knew, was a sign that he
was agitated. The stern window was open, for it was a warm night,
and you could see the moon shining behind on the ship's wake.

"Now, Hawkins," said the squire, "you have something to say.
Speak up."

I did as I was bid, and as short as I could make it, told the
whole details of Silver's conversation. Nobody interrupted me till
I was done, nor did any one of the three of them make so much as a
movement, but they kept their eyes upon my face from first to
last.

"Jim," said Dr. Livesey, "take a seat."
