<br/>"Hands off!" cried Silver, leaping back a yard, as it seemed to<br/>me, with the speed and security of a trained gymnast.<br/><br/>"Hands off, if you like, John Silver," said the other. "It's a<br/>black conscience that can make you feared of me. But in heaven's<br/>name, tell me, what was that?"<br/><br/>"That?" returned Silver, smiling away, but warier than ever, his<br/>eye a mere pin-point in his big face, but gleaming like a crumb of<br/>glass. "That?" Oh, I reckon that'll be Alan."<br/><br/>And at this point Tom flashed out like a hero.<br/><br/>"Alan!" he cried. "Then rest his soul for a true seaman! And as<br/>for you, John Silver, long you've been a mate of mine, but you're<br/>mate of mine no more. If I die like a dog, I'll die in my dooty.<br/>You've killed Alan, have you? Kill me too, if you can. But I defies<br/>you."<br/><br/>And with that, this brave fellow turned his back directly on the<br/>cook and set off walking for the beach. But he was not destined to<br/>go far. With a cry John seized the branch of a tree, whipped the<br/>crutch out of his armpit, and sent that uncouth missile hurtling<br/>through the air. It struck poor Tom, point foremost, and with<br/>stunning violence, right between the shoulders in the middle of his<br/>back. His hands flew up, he gave a sort of gasp, and fell.<br/><br/>Whether he were injured much or little, none could ever tell.<br/>Like enough, to judge from the sound, his back was broken on the<br/>spot. But he had no time given him to recover. Silver, agile as a<br/>monkey even without leg or crutch, was on the top of him next<br/>moment and had twice buried his knife up to the hilt in that<br/>defenceless body. From my place of ambush, I could hear him pant<br/>aloud as he struck the blows.<br/><br/>I do not know what it rightly is to faint, but I do know that<br/>for the next little while the whole world swam away from before me<br/>in a whirling mist; Silver and the birds, and the tall Spy-glass<br/>hilltop, going round and round and topsy-turvy before my eyes, and<br/>all manner of bells ringing and distant voices shouting in my<br/>ear.<br/><br/>When I came again to myself the monster had pulled himself<br/>together, his crutch under his arm, his hat upon his head. Just<br/>before him Tom lay motionless upon the sward; but the murderer<br/>minded him not a whit, cleansing his blood-stained knife the while<br/>upon a wisp of grass. Everything else was unchanged, the sun still<br/>shining mercilessly on the steaming marsh and the tall pinnacle of<br/>the mountain, and I could scarce persuade myself that murder had<br/>been actually done and a human life cruelly cut short a moment<br/>since before my eyes.<br/><br/>But now John put his hand into his pocket, brought out a<br/>whistle, and blew upon it several modulated blasts that rang far<br/>across the heated air. I could not tell, of course, the meaning of<br/>the signal, but it instantly awoke my fears. More men would be<br/>coming. I might be discovered. They had already slain two of the<br/>honest people; after Tom and Alan, might not I come next?<br/><br/>
