I was dead tired, as you may fancy; and when I got to sleep,
which was not till after a great deal of tossing, I slept like a
log of wood.

The rest had long been up and had already breakfasted and
increased the pile of firewood by about half as much again when I
was wakened by a bustle and the sound of voices.

"Flag of truce!" I heard someone say; and then, immediately
after, with a cry of surprise, "Silver himself!"

And at that, up I jumped, and rubbing my eyes, ran to a loophole
in the wall.
