<br/>"And who is that?" asked the squire.<br/><br/>"Silver, sir," returned the captain; "he's as anxious as you and<br/>I to smother things up. This is a tiff; he'd soon talk 'em out of<br/>it if he had the chance, and what I propose to do is to give him<br/>the chance. Let's allow the men an afternoon ashore. If they all<br/>go, why we'll fight the ship. If they none of them go, well then,<br/>we hold the cabin, and God defend the right. If some go, you mark<br/>my words, sir, Silver'll bring 'em aboard again as mild as<br/>lambs."<br/><br/>It was so decided; loaded pistols were served out to all the<br/>sure men; Hunter, Joyce, and Redruth were taken into our confidence<br/>and received the news with less surprise and a better spirit than<br/>we had looked for, and then the captain went on deck and addressed<br/>the crew.<br/><br/>"My lads," said he, "we've had a hot day and are all tired and<br/>out of sorts. A turn ashore'll hurt nobody—the boats are still in<br/>the water; you can take the gigs, and as many as please may go<br/>ashore for the afternoon. I'll fire a gun half an hour before<br/>sundown."<br/><br/>I believe the silly fellows must have thought they would break<br/>their shins over treasure as soon as they were landed, for they all<br/>came out of their sulks in a moment and gave a cheer that started<br/>the echo in a far-away hill and sent the birds once more flying and<br/>squalling round the anchorage.<br/><br/>The captain was too bright to be in the way. He whipped out of<br/>sight in a moment, leaving Silver to arrange the party, and I fancy<br/>it was as well he did so. Had he been on deck, he could no longer<br/>so much as have pretended not to understand the situation. It was<br/>as plain as day. Silver was the captain, and a mighty rebellious<br/>crew he had of it. The honest hands—and I was soon to see it proved<br/>that there were such on board—must have been very stupid fellows.<br/>Or rather, I suppose the truth was this, that all hands were<br/>disaffected by the example of the ringleaders—only some more, some<br/>less; and a few, being good fellows in the main, could neither be<br/>led nor driven any further. It is one thing to be idle and skulk<br/>and quite another to take a ship and murder a number of innocent<br/>men.<br/><br/>At last, however, the party was made up. Six fellows were to<br/>stay on board, and the remaining thirteen, including Silver, began<br/>to embark.<br/><br/>Then it was that there came into my head the first of the mad<br/>notions that contributed so much to save our lives. If six men were<br/>left by Silver, it was plain our party could not take and fight the<br/>ship; and since only six were left, it was equally plain that the<br/>cabin party had no present need of my assistance. It occurred to me<br/>at once to go ashore. In a jiffy I had slipped over the side and<br/>curled up in the fore-sheets of the nearest boat, and almost at the<br/>same moment she shoved off.<br/><br/>No one took notice of me, only the bow oar saying, "Is that you,<br/>Jim? Keep your head down." But Silver, from the other boat, looked<br/>sharply over and called out to know if that were me; and from that<br/>moment I began to regret what I had done.<br/><br/>The crews raced for the beach, but the boat I was in, having<br/>some start and being at once the lighter and the better manned,<br/>shot far ahead of her consort, and the bow had struck among the<br/>shore-side trees and I had caught a branch and swung myself out and<br/>plunged into the nearest thicket while Silver and the rest were<br/>still a hundred yards behind.<br/><br/>
