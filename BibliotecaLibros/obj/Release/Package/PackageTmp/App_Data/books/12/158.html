<br/>I will own that I here began to weep. "Doctor," I said, "you<br/>might spare me. I have blamed myself enough; my life's forfeit<br/>anyway, and I should have been dead by now if Silver hadn't stood<br/>for me; and doctor, believe this, I can die—and I dare say I<br/>deserve it—but what I fear is torture. If they come to torture<br/>me—"<br/><br/>"Jim," the doctor interrupted, and his voice was quite changed,<br/>"Jim, I can't have this. Whip over, and we'll run for it."<br/><br/>"Doctor," said I, "I passed my word."<br/><br/>"I know, I know," he cried. "We can't help that, Jim, now. I'll<br/>take it on my shoulders, holus bolus, blame and shame, my boy; but<br/>stay here, I cannot let you. Jump! One jump, and you're out, and<br/>we'll run for it like antelopes."<br/><br/>"No," I replied; "you know right well you wouldn't do the thing<br/>yourself—neither you nor squire nor captain; and no more will I.<br/>Silver trusted me; I passed my word, and back I go. But, doctor,<br/>you did not let me finish. If they come to torture me, I might let<br/>slip a word of where the ship is, for I got the ship, part by luck<br/>and part by risking, and she lies in North Inlet, on the southern<br/>beach, and just below high water. At half tide she must be high and<br/>dry."<br/><br/>"The ship!" exclaimed the doctor.<br/><br/>Rapidly I described to him my adventures, and he heard me out in<br/>silence.<br/><br/>"There is a kind of fate in this," he observed when I had done.<br/>"Every step, it's you that saves our lives; and do you suppose by<br/>any chance that we are going to let you lose yours? That would be a<br/>poor return, my boy. You found out the plot; you found Ben Gunn—the<br/>best deed that ever you did, or will do, though you live to ninety.<br/>Oh, by Jupiter, and talking of Ben Gunn! Why, this is the mischief<br/>in person. Silver!" he cried. "Silver! I'll give you a piece of<br/>advice," he continued as the cook drew near again; "don't you be in<br/>any great hurry after that treasure."<br/><br/>"Why, sir, I do my possible, which that ain't," said Silver. "I<br/>can only, asking your pardon, save my life and the boy's by seeking<br/>for that treasure; and you may lay to that."<br/><br/>"Well, Silver," replied the doctor, "if that is so, I'll go one<br/>step further: look out for squalls when you find it."<br/><br/>
