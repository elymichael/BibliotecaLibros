<br/>The moon was climbing higher and higher, its light began to fall<br/>here and there in masses through the more open districts of the<br/>wood, and right in front of me a glow of a different colour<br/>appeared among the trees. It was red and hot, and now and again it<br/>was a little darkened—as it were, the embers of a bonfire<br/>smouldering.<br/><br/>For the life of me I could not think what it might be.<br/><br/>At last I came right down upon the borders of the clearing. The<br/>western end was already steeped in moon-shine; the rest, and the<br/>block house itself, still lay in a black shadow chequered with long<br/>silvery streaks of light. On the other side of the house an immense<br/>fire had burned itself into clear embers and shed a steady, red<br/>reverberation, contrasted strongly with the mellow paleness of the<br/>moon. There was not a soul stirring nor a sound beside the noises<br/>of the breeze.<br/><br/>I stopped, with much wonder in my heart, and perhaps a little<br/>terror also. It had not been our way to build great fires; we were,<br/>indeed, by the captain's orders, somewhat niggardly of firewood,<br/>and I began to fear that something had gone wrong while I was<br/>absent.<br/><br/>I stole round by the eastern end, keeping close in shadow, and<br/>at a convenient place, where the darkness was thickest, crossed the<br/>palisade.<br/><br/>To make assurance surer, I got upon my hands and knees and<br/>crawled, without a sound, towards the corner of the house. As I<br/>drew nearer, my heart was suddenly and greatly lightened. It is not<br/>a pleasant noise in itself, and I have often complained of it at<br/>other times, but just then it was like music to hear my friends<br/>snoring together so loud and peaceful in their sleep. The sea-cry<br/>of the watch, that beautiful "All's well," never fell more<br/>reassuringly on my ear.<br/><br/>In the meantime, there was no doubt of one thing; they kept an<br/>infamous bad watch. If it had been Silver and his lads that were<br/>now creeping in on them, not a soul would have seen daybreak. That<br/>was what it was, thought I, to have the captain wounded; and again<br/>I blamed myself sharply for leaving them in that danger with so few<br/>to mount guard.<br/><br/>By this time I had got to the door and stood up. All was dark<br/>within, so that I could distinguish nothing by the eye. As for<br/>sounds, there was the steady drone of the snorers and a small<br/>occasional noise, a flickering or pecking that I could in no way<br/>account for.<br/><br/>With my arms before me I walked steadily in. I should lie down<br/>in my own place (I thought with a silent chuckle) and enjoy their<br/>faces when they found me in the morning.<br/><br/>My foot struck something yielding—it was a sleeper's leg; and he<br/>turned and groaned, but without awaking.<br/><br/>
