And then, all of a sudden, a shrill voice broke forth out of the
darkness:

"Pieces of eight! Pieces of eight! Pieces of eight! Pieces of
eight! Pieces of eight! and so forth, without pause or change, like
the clacking of a tiny mill.

Silver's green parrot, Captain Flint! It was she whom I had
heard pecking at a piece of bark; it was she, keeping better watch
than any human being, who thus announced my arrival with her
wearisome refrain.

I had no time left me to recover. At the sharp, clipping tone of
the parrot, the sleepers awoke and sprang up; and with a mighty
oath, the voice of Silver cried, "Who goes?"

I turned to run, struck violently against one person, recoiled,
and ran full into the arms of a second, who for his part closed
upon and held me tight.

"Bring a torch, Dick," said Silver when my capture was thus
assured.

And one of the men left the log-house and presently returned
with a lighted brand.
