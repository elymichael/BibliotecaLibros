<br/>At length I thought I might return towards the stockade. I was<br/>pretty far down on the low, sandy spit that encloses the anchorage<br/>to the east, and is joined at half-water to Skeleton Island; and<br/>now, as I rose to my feet, I saw, some distance further down the<br/>spit and rising from among low bushes, an isolated rock, pretty<br/>high, and peculiarly white in colour. It occurred to me that this<br/>might be the white rock of which Ben Gunn had spoken and that some<br/>day or other a boat might be wanted and I should know where to look<br/>for one.<br/><br/>Then I skirted among the woods until I had regained the rear, or<br/>shoreward side, of the stockade, and was soon warmly welcomed by<br/>the faithful party.<br/><br/>I had soon told my story and began to look about me. The<br/>log-house was made of unsquared trunks of pine—roof, walls, and<br/>floor. The latter stood in several places as much as a foot or a<br/>foot and a half above the surface of the sand. There was a porch at<br/>the door, and under this porch the little spring welled up into an<br/>artificial basin of a rather odd kind—no other than a great ship's<br/>kettle of iron, with the bottom knocked out, and sunk "to her<br/>bearings," as the captain said, among the sand.<br/><br/>Little had been left besides the framework of the house, but in<br/>one corner there was a stone slab laid down by way of hearth and an<br/>old rusty iron basket to contain the fire.<br/><br/>The slopes of the knoll and all the inside of the stockade had<br/>been cleared of timber to build the house, and we could see by the<br/>stumps what a fine and lofty grove had been destroyed. Most of the<br/>soil had been washed away or buried in drift after the removal of<br/>the trees; only where the streamlet ran down from the kettle a<br/>thick bed of moss and some ferns and little creeping bushes were<br/>still green among the sand. Very close around the stockade—too<br/>close for defence, they said—the wood still flourished high and<br/>dense, all of fir on the land side, but towards the sea with a<br/>large admixture of live-oaks.<br/><br/>The cold evening breeze, of which I have spoken, whistled<br/>through every chink of the rude building and sprinkled the floor<br/>with a continual rain of fine sand. There was sand in our eyes,<br/>sand in our teeth, sand in our suppers, sand dancing in the spring<br/>at the bottom of the kettle, for all the world like porridge<br/>beginning to boil. Our chimney was a square hole in the roof; it<br/>was but a little part of the smoke that found its way out, and the<br/>rest eddied about the house and kept us coughing and piping the<br/>eye.<br/><br/>Add to this that Gray, the new man, had his face tied up in a<br/>bandage for a cut he had got in breaking away from the mutineers<br/>and that poor old Tom Redruth, still unburied, lay along the wall,<br/>stiff and stark, under the Union Jack.<br/><br/>If we had been allowed to sit idle, we should all have fallen in<br/>the blues, but Captain Smollett was never the man for that. All<br/>hands were called up before him, and he divided us into watches.<br/>The doctor and Gray and I for one; the squire, Hunter, and Joyce<br/>upon the other. Tired though we all were, two were sent out for<br/>firewood; two more were set to dig a grave for Redruth; the doctor<br/>was named cook; I was put sentry at the door; and the captain<br/>himself went from one to another, keeping up our spirits and<br/>lending a hand wherever it was wanted.<br/><br/>From time to time the doctor came to the door for a little air<br/>and to rest his eyes, which were almost smoked out of his head, and<br/>whenever he did so, he had a word for me.<br/><br/>"That man Smollett," he said once, "is a better man than I am.<br/>And when I say that it means a deal, Jim."<br/><br/>
