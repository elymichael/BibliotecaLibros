My first impulse was one of despair, but my second was towards<br/>joy. Round she came, till she was broadside on to me—round still<br/>till she had covered a half and then two thirds and then three<br/>quarters of the distance that separated us. I could see the waves<br/>boiling white under her forefoot. Immensely tall she looked to me<br/>from my low station in the coracle.<br/><br/>And then, of a sudden, I began to comprehend. I had scarce time<br/>to think—scarce time to act and save myself. I was on the summit of<br/>one swell when the schooner came stooping over the next. The<br/>bowsprit was over my head. I sprang to my feet and leaped, stamping<br/>the coracle under water. With one hand I caught the jib-boom, while<br/>my foot was lodged between the stay and the brace; and as I still<br/>clung there panting, a dull blow told me that the schooner had<br/>charged down upon and struck the coracle and that I was left<br/>without retreat on the Hispaniola.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
