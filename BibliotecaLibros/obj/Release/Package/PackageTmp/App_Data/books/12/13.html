<br/>"Well, then," said he, "you hold the basin"; and with that he<br/>took his lancet and opened a vein.<br/><br/>A great deal of blood was taken before the captain opened his<br/>eyes and looked mistily about him. First he recognized the doctor<br/>with an unmistakable frown; then his glance fell upon me, and he<br/>looked relieved. But suddenly his colour changed, and he tried to<br/>raise himself, crying, "Where's Black Dog?"<br/><br/>"There is no Black Dog here," said the doctor, "except what you<br/>have on your own back. You have been drinking rum; you have had a<br/>stroke, precisely as I told you; and I have just, very much against<br/>my own will, dragged you headforemost out of the grave. Now, Mr.<br/>Bones—"<br/><br/>"That's not my name," he interrupted.<br/><br/>"Much I care," returned the doctor. "It's the name of a<br/>buccaneer of my acquaintance; and I call you by it for the sake of<br/>shortness, and what I have to say to you is this; one glass of rum<br/>won't kill you, but if you take one you'll take another and<br/>another, and I stake my wig if you don't break off short, you'll<br/>die—do you understand that?—die, and go to your own place, like the<br/>man in the Bible. Come, now, make an effort. I'll help you to your<br/>bed for once."<br/><br/>Between us, with much trouble, we managed to hoist him upstairs,<br/>and laid him on his bed, where his head fell back on the pillow as<br/>if he were almost fainting.<br/><br/>"Now, mind you," said the doctor, "I clear my conscience—the<br/>name of rum for you is death."<br/><br/>And with that he went off to see my father, taking me with him<br/>by the arm.<br/><br/>"This is nothing," he said as soon as he had closed the door. "I<br/>have drawn blood enough to keep him quiet awhile; he should lie for<br/>a week where he is—that is the best thing for him and you; but<br/>another stroke would settle him."<br/><br/><br/><br/>
