And they made me sit down at table beside them, poured me out a
glass of wine, filled my hands with raisins, and all three, one
after the other, and each with a bow, drank my good health, and
their service to me, for my luck and courage.

"Now, captain," said the squire, "you were right, and I was
wrong. I own myself an ass, and I await your orders."

"No more an ass than I, sir," returned the captain. "I never
heard of a crew that meant to mutiny but what showed signs before,
for any man that had an eye in his head to see the mischief and
take steps according. But this crew," he added, "beats me."

"Captain," said the doctor, "with your permission, that's
Silver. A very remarkable man."

"He'd look remarkably well from a yard-arm, sir," returned the
captain. "But this is talk; this don't lead to anything. I see
three or four points, and with Mr. Trelawney's permission, I'll
name them."

"You, sir, are the captain. It is for you to speak," says Mr.
Trelawney grandly.

"First point," began Mr. Smollett. "We must go on, because we
can't turn back. If I gave the word to go about, they would rise at
once. Second point, we have time before us—at least until this
treasure's found. Third point, there are faithful hands. Now, sir,
it's got to come to blows sooner or later, and what I propose is to
take time by the forelock, as the saying is, and come to blows some
fine day when they least expect it. We can count, I take it, on
your own home servants, Mr. Trelawney?"

"As upon myself," declared the squire.

"Three," reckoned the captain; "ourselves make seven, counting
Hawkins here. Now, about the honest hands?"

"Most likely Trelawney's own men," said the doctor; "those he
had picked up for himself before he lit on Silver."

"Nay," replied the squire. "Hands was one of mine."
