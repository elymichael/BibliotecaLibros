<br/>The paper had been sealed in several places with a thimble by<br/>way of seal; the very thimble, perhaps, that I had found in the<br/>captain's pocket. The doctor opened the seals with great care, and<br/>there fell out the map of an island, with latitude and longitude,<br/>soundings, names of hills and bays and inlets, and every particular<br/>that would be needed to bring a ship to a safe anchorage upon its<br/>shores. It was about nine miles long and five across, shaped, you<br/>might say, like a fat dragon standing up, and had two fine<br/>land-locked harbours, and a hill in the centre part marked "The<br/>Spy-glass." There were several additions of a later date, but above<br/>all, three crosses of red ink—two on the north part of the island,<br/>one in the southwest—and beside this last, in the same red ink, and<br/>in a small, neat hand, very different from the captain's tottery<br/>characters, these words: "Bulk of treasure here."<br/><br/>Over on the back the same hand had written this further<br/>information:<br/><br/><br/>Tall tree, Spy-glass shoulder, bearing a point to&#160;the N. of<br/>N.N.E.&#160;Skeleton Island E.S.E. and by E.<br/><br/>Ten feet.<br/><br/>The bar silver is in the north cache; you can find&#160;it by<br/>the trend of the east hummock, ten fathoms<br/><br/>south of the black crag with the face on it.&#160;The arms are<br/>easy found, in the sand-hill, N.&#160;point of north inlet cape,<br/>bearing E. and a&#160;quarter N.<br/><br/>J.F.<br/><br/><br/>That was all; but brief as it was, and to me incomprehensible,<br/>it filled the squire and Dr. Livesey with delight.<br/><br/>"Livesey," said the squire, "you will give up this wretched<br/>practice at once. Tomorrow I start for Bristol. In three weeks'<br/>time—three weeks!—two weeks—ten days—we'll have the best ship, sir,<br/>and the choicest crew in England. Hawkins shall come as cabin-boy.<br/>You'll make a famous cabin-boy, Hawkins. You, Livesey, are ship's<br/>doctor; I am admiral. We'll take Redruth, Joyce, and Hunter. We'll<br/>have favourable winds, a quick passage, and not the least<br/>difficulty in finding the spot, and money to eat, to roll in, to<br/>play duck and drake with ever after."<br/><br/>
