All the way in, Long John stood by the steersman and conned the<br/>ship. He knew the passage like the palm of his hand, and though the<br/>man in the chains got everywhere more water than was down in the<br/>chart, John never hesitated once.<br/><br/>"There's a strong scour with the ebb," he said, "and this here<br/>passage has been dug out, in a manner of speaking, with a<br/>spade."<br/><br/>We brought up just where the anchor was in the chart, about a<br/>third of a mile from each shore, the mainland on one side and<br/>Skeleton Island on the other. The bottom was clean sand. The plunge<br/>of our anchor sent up clouds of birds wheeling and crying over the<br/>woods, but in less than a minute they were down again and all was<br/>once more silent.<br/><br/>The place was entirely land-locked, buried in woods, the trees<br/>coming right down to high-water mark, the shores mostly flat, and<br/>the hilltops standing round at a distance in a sort of<br/>amphitheatre, one here, one there. Two little rivers, or rather two<br/>swamps, emptied out into this pond, as you might call it; and the<br/>foliage round that part of the shore had a kind of poisonous<br/>brightness. From the ship we could see nothing of the house or<br/>stockade, for they were quite buried among trees; and if it had not<br/>been for the chart on the companion, we might have been the first<br/>that had ever anchored there since the island arose out of the<br/>seas.<br/><br/>There was not a breath of air moving, nor a sound but that of<br/>the surf booming half a mile away along the beaches and against the<br/>rocks outside. A peculiar stagnant smell hung over the anchorageâ€”a<br/>smell of sodden leaves and rotting tree trunks. I observed the<br/>doctor sniffing and sniffing, like someone tasting a bad egg.<br/><br/>"I don't know about treasure," he said, "but I'll stake my wig<br/>there's fever here."<br/><br/>If the conduct of the men had been alarming in the boat, it<br/>became truly threatening when they had come aboard. They lay about<br/>the deck growling together in talk. The slightest order was<br/>received with a black look and grudgingly and carelessly obeyed.<br/>Even the honest hands must have caught the infection, for there was<br/>not one man aboard to mend another. Mutiny, it was plain, hung over<br/>us like a thunder-cloud.<br/><br/>And it was not only we of the cabin party who perceived the<br/>danger. Long John was hard at work going from group to group,<br/>spending himself in good advice, and as for example no man could<br/>have shown a better. He fairly outstripped himself in willingness<br/>and civility; he was all smiles to everyone. If an order were<br/>given, John would be on his crutch in an instant, with the<br/>cheeriest "Aye, aye, sir!" in the world; and when there was nothing<br/>else to do, he kept up one song after another, as if to conceal the<br/>discontent of the rest.<br/><br/>Of all the gloomy features of that gloomy afternoon, this<br/>obvious anxiety on the part of Long John appeared the worst.<br/><br/>We held a council in the cabin.<br/><br/>"Sir," said the captain, "if I risk another order, the whole<br/>ship'll come about our ears by the run. You see, sir, here it is. I<br/>get a rough answer, do I not? Well, if I speak back, pikes will be<br/>going in two shakes; if I don't, Silver will see there's something<br/>under that, and the game's up. Now, we've only one man to rely<br/>on."<br/>
