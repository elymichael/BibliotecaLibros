And then, as Morgan rolled back to his seat, Silver added to me<br/>in a confidential whisper that was very flattering, as I thought,<br/>"He's quite an honest man, Tom Morgan, on'y stupid. And now," he<br/>ran on again, aloud, "let's see—Black Dog? No, I don't know the<br/>name, not I. Yet I kind of think I've—yes, I've seen the swab. He<br/>used to come here with a blind beggar, he used."<br/><br/>"That he did, you may be sure," said I. "I knew that blind man<br/>too. His name was Pew."<br/><br/>"It was!" cried Silver, now quite excited. "Pew! That were his<br/>name for certain. Ah, he looked a shark, he did! If we run down<br/>this Black Dog, now, there'll be news for Cap'n Trelawney! Ben's a<br/>good runner; few seamen run better than Ben. He should run him<br/>down, hand over hand, by the powers! He talked o' keel-hauling, did<br/>he? I'll keel-haul him!"<br/><br/>All the time he was jerking out these phrases he was stumping up<br/>and down the tavern on his crutch, slapping tables with his hand,<br/>and giving such a show of excitement as would have convinced an Old<br/>Bailey judge or a Bow Street runner. My suspicions had been<br/>thoroughly reawakened on finding Black Dog at the Spy-glass, and I<br/>watched the cook narrowly. But he was too deep, and too ready, and<br/>too clever for me, and by the time the two men had come back out of<br/>breath and confessed that they had lost the track in a crowd, and<br/>been scolded like thieves, I would have gone bail for the innocence<br/>of Long John Silver.<br/><br/>"See here, now, Hawkins," said he, "here's a blessed hard thing<br/>on a man like me, now, ain't it? There's Cap'n Trelawney—what's he<br/>to think? Here I have this confounded son of a Dutchman sitting in<br/>my own house drinking of my own rum! Here you comes and tells me of<br/>it plain; and here I let him give us all the slip before my blessed<br/>deadlights! Now, Hawkins, you do me justice with the cap'n. You're<br/>a lad, you are, but you're as smart as paint. I see that when you<br/>first come in. Now, here it is: What could I do, with this old<br/>timber I hobble on? When I was an A B master mariner I'd have come<br/>up alongside of him, hand over hand, and broached him to in a brace<br/>of old shakes, I would; but now—"<br/><br/>And then, all of a sudden, he stopped, and his jaw dropped as<br/>though he had remembered something.<br/><br/>"The score!" he burst out. "Three goes o' rum! Why, shiver my<br/>timbers, if I hadn't forgotten my score!"<br/><br/>And falling on a bench, he laughed until the tears ran down his<br/>cheeks. I could not help joining, and we laughed together, peal<br/>after peal, until the tavern rang again.<br/><br/>"Why, what a precious old sea-calf I am!" he said at last,<br/>wiping his cheeks. "You and me should get on well, Hawkins, for<br/>I'll take my davy I should be rated ship's boy. But come now, stand<br/>by to go about. This won't do. Dooty is dooty, messmates. I'll put<br/>on my old cockerel hat, and step along of you to Cap'n Trelawney,<br/>and report this here affair. For mind you, it's serious, young<br/>Hawkins; and neither you nor me's come out of it with what I should<br/>make so bold as to call credit. Nor you neither, says you; not<br/>smart—none of the pair of us smart. But dash my buttons! That was a<br/>good un about my score."<br/><br/>And he began to laugh again, and that so heartily, that though I<br/>did not see the joke as he did, I was again obliged to join him in<br/>his mirth.<br/><br/>On our little walk along the quays, he made himself the most<br/>interesting companion, telling me about the different ships that we<br/>passed by, their rig, tonnage, and nationality, explaining the work<br/>that was going forward—how one was discharging, another taking in<br/>cargo, and a third making ready for sea—and every now and then<br/>telling me some little anecdote of ships or seamen or repeating a<br/>nautical phrase till I had learned it perfectly. I began to see<br/>that here was one of the best of possible shipmates.<br/>
