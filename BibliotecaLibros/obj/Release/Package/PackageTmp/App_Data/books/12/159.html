"Sir," said Silver, "as between man and man, that's too much and<br/>too little. What you're after, why you left the block house, why<br/>you given me that there chart, I don't know, now, do I? And yet I<br/>done your bidding with my eyes shut and never a word of hope! But<br/>no, this here's too much. If you won't tell me what you mean plain<br/>out, just say so and I'll leave the helm."<br/><br/>"No," said the doctor musingly; "I've no right to say more; it's<br/>not my secret, you see, Silver, or, I give you my word, I'd tell it<br/>you. But I'll go as far with you as I dare go, and a step beyond,<br/>for I'll have my wig sorted by the captain or I'm mistaken! And<br/>first, I'll give you a bit of hope; Silver, if we both get alive<br/>out of this wolf-trap, I'll do my best to save you, short of<br/>perjury."<br/><br/>Silver's face was radiant. "You couldn't say more, I'm sure,<br/>sir, not if you was my mother," he cried.<br/><br/>"Well, that's my first concession," added the doctor. "My second<br/>is a piece of advice: keep the boy close beside you, and when you<br/>need help, halloo. I'm off to seek it for you, and that itself will<br/>show you if I speak at random. Good-bye, Jim."<br/><br/>And Dr. Livesey shook hand s with me through the stockade,<br/>nodded to Silver, and set off at a brisk pace into the wood.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
