<br/>"That's a summons, mate. I'll tell you if they get that. But you<br/>keep your weather-eye open, Jim, and I'll share with you equals,<br/>upon my honour."<br/><br/>He wandered a little longer, his voice growing weaker; but soon<br/>after I had given him his medicine, which he took like a child,<br/>with the remark, "If ever a seaman wanted drugs, it's me," he fell<br/>at last into a heavy, swoon-like sleep, in which I left him. What I<br/>should have done had all gone well I do not know. Probably I should<br/>have told the whole story to the doctor, for I was in mortal fear<br/>lest the captain should repent of his confessions and make an end<br/>of me. But as things fell out, my poor father died quite suddenly<br/>that evening, which put all other matters on one side. Our natural<br/>distress, the visits of the neighbours, the arranging of the<br/>funeral, and all the work of the inn to be carried on in the<br/>meanwhile kept me so busy that I had scarcely time to think of the<br/>captain, far less to be afraid of him.<br/><br/>He got downstairs next morning, to be sure, and had his meals as<br/>usual, though he ate little and had more, I am afraid, than his<br/>usual supply of rum, for he helped himself out of the bar, scowling<br/>and blowing through his nose, and no one dared to cross him. On the<br/>night before the funeral he was as drunk as ever; and it was<br/>shocking, in that house of mourning, to hear him singing away at<br/>his ugly old sea-song; but weak as he was, we were all in the fear<br/>of death for him, and the doctor was suddenly taken up with a case<br/>many miles away and was never near the house after my father's<br/>death. I have said the captain was weak, and indeed he seemed<br/>rather to grow weaker than regain his strength. He clambered up and<br/>down stairs, and went from the parlour to the bar and back again,<br/>and sometimes put his nose out of doors to smell the sea, holding<br/>on to the walls as he went for support and breathing hard and fast<br/>like a man on a steep mountain. He never particularly addressed me,<br/>and it is my belief he had as good as forgotten his confidences;<br/>but his temper was more flighty, and allowing for his bodily<br/>weakness, more violent than ever. He had an alarming way now when<br/>he was drunk of drawing his cutlass and laying it bare before him<br/>on the table. But with all that, he minded people less and seemed<br/>shut up in his own thoughts and rather wandering. Once, for<br/>instance, to our extreme wonder, he piped up to a different air, a<br/>king of country love-song that he must have learned in his youth<br/>before he had begun to follow the sea.<br/><br/>So things passed until, the day after the funeral, and about<br/>three o'clock of a bitter, foggy, frosty afternoon, I was standing<br/>at the door for a moment, full of sad thoughts about my father,<br/>when I saw someone drawing slowly near along the road. He was<br/>plainly blind, for he tapped before him with a stick and wore a<br/>great green shade over his eyes and nose; and he was hunched, as if<br/>with age or weakness, and wore a huge old tattered sea-cloak with a<br/>hood that made him appear positively deformed. I never saw in my<br/>life a more dreadful-looking figure. He stopped a little from the<br/>inn, and raising his voice in an odd sing-song, addressed the air<br/>in front of him, "Will any kind friend inform a poor blind man, who<br/>has lost the precious sight of his eyes in the gracious defence of<br/>his native country, England—and God bless King George!—where or in<br/>what part of this country he may now be?"<br/><br/>"You are at the Admiral Benbow, Black Hill Cove, my good man,"<br/>said I.<br/><br/>"I hear a voice," said he, "a young voice. Will you give me your<br/>hand, my kind young friend, and lead me in?"<br/><br/>I held out my hand, and the horrible, soft-spoken, eyeless<br/>creature gripped it in a moment like a vise. I was so much startled<br/>that I struggled to withdraw, but the blind man pulled me close up<br/>to him with a single action of his arm.<br/><br/>"Now, boy," he said, "take me in to the captain."<br/><br/>"Sir," said I, "upon my word I dare not."<br/><br/>"Oh," he sneered, "that's it! Take me in straight or I'll break<br/>your arm."<br/><br/>
