The cook came up the side like a monkey for cleverness, and as<br/>soon as he saw what was doing, "So ho, mates!" says he. "What's<br/>this?"<br/><br/>"We're a-changing of the powder, Jack," answers one.<br/><br/>"Why, by the powers," cried Long John, "if we do, we'll miss the<br/>morning tide!"<br/><br/>"My orders!" said the captain shortly. "You may go below, my<br/>man. Hands will want supper."<br/><br/>"Aye, aye, sir," answered the cook, and touching his forelock,<br/>he disappeared at once in the direction of his galley. "That's a<br/>good man, captain," said the doctor.<br/><br/>"Very likely, sir," replied Captain Smollett. "Easy with that,<br/>menâ€”easy," he ran on, to the fellows who were shifting the powder;<br/>and then suddenly observing me examining the swivel we carried<br/>amidships, a long brass nine, "Here you, ship's boy," he cried,<br/>"out o' that! Off with you to the cook and get some work."<br/><br/>And then as I was hurrying off I heard him say, quite loudly, to<br/>the doctor, "I'll have no favourites on my ship." I assure you I<br/>was quite of the squire's way of thinking, and hated the captain<br/>deeply.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
