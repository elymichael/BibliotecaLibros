"Dig away, boys," said Silver with the coolest insolence;<br/>"you'll find some pig-nuts and I shouldn't wonder."<br/><br/>"Pig-nuts!" repeated Merry, in a scream. "Mates, do you hear<br/>that? I tell you now, that man there knew it all along. Look in the<br/>face of him and you'll see it wrote there."<br/><br/>"Ah, Merry," remarked Silver, "standing for cap'n again? You're<br/>a pushing lad, to be sure."<br/><br/>But this time everyone was entirely in Merry's favour. They<br/>began to scramble out of the excavation, darting furious glances<br/>behind them. One thing I observed, which looked well for us: they<br/>all got out upon the opposite side from Silver.<br/><br/>Well, there we stood, two on one side, five on the other, the<br/>pit between us, and nobody screwed up high enough to offer the<br/>first blow. Silver never moved; he watched them, very upright on<br/>his crutch, and looked as cool as ever I saw him. He was brave, and<br/>no mistake.<br/><br/>At last Merry seemed to think a speech might help matters.<br/><br/>"Mates," says he, "there's two of them alone there; one's the<br/>old cripple that brought us all here and blundered us down to this;<br/>the other's that cub that I mean to have the heart of. Now,<br/>mates—"<br/><br/>He was raising his arm and his voice, and plainly meant to lead<br/>a charge. But just then—crack! crack! crack!—three musket-shots<br/>flashed out of the thicket. Merry tumbled head foremost into the<br/>excavation; the man with the bandage spun round like a teetotum and<br/>fell all his length upon his side, where he lay dead, but still<br/>twitching; and the other three turned and ran for it with all their<br/>might.<br/><br/>Before you could wink, Long John had fired two barrels of a<br/>pistol into the struggling Merry, and as the man rolled up his eyes<br/>at him in the last agony, "George," said he, "I reckon I settled<br/>you."<br/><br/>At the same moment, the doctor, Gray, and Ben Gunn joined us,<br/>with smoking muskets, from among the nutmeg-trees.<br/><br/>"Forward!" cried the doctor. "Double quick, my lads. We must<br/>head 'em off the boats."<br/>
