After reloading, we walked down the outside of the palisade to<br/>see to the fallen enemy. He was stone deadâ€”shot through the<br/>heart.<br/><br/>We began to rejoice over our good success when just at that<br/>moment a pistol cracked in the bush, a ball whistled close past my<br/>ear, and poor Tom Redruth stumbled and fell his length on the<br/>ground. Both the squire and I returned the shot, but as we had<br/>nothing to aim at, it is probable we only wasted powder. Then we<br/>reloaded and turned our attention to poor Tom.<br/><br/>The captain and Gray were already examining him, and I saw with<br/>half an eye that all was over.<br/><br/>I believe the readiness of our return volley had scattered the<br/>mutineers once more, for we were suffered without further<br/>molestation to get the poor old gamekeeper hoisted over the<br/>stockade and carried, groaning and bleeding, into the log-house.<br/>Poor old fellow, he had not uttered one word of surprise,<br/>complaint, fear, or even acquiescence from the very beginning of<br/>our troubles till now, when we had laid him down in the log-house<br/>to die. He had lain like a Trojan behind his mattress in the<br/>gallery; he had followed every order silently, doggedly, and well;<br/>he was the oldest of our party by a score of years; and now,<br/>sullen, old, serviceable servant, it was he that was to die.<br/><br/>The squire dropped down beside him on his knees and kissed his<br/>hand, crying like a child.<br/><br/>"Be I going, doctor?" he asked.<br/><br/>"Tom, my man," said I, "you're going home."<br/><br/>"I wish I had had a lick at them with the gun first," he<br/>replied.<br/><br/>"Tom," said the squire, "say you forgive me, won't you?"<br/><br/>"Would that be respectful like, from me to you, squire?" was the<br/>answer. "Howsoever, so be it, amen!"<br/><br/>After a little while of silence, he said he thought somebody<br/>might read a prayer. "It's the custom, sir," he added<br/>apologetically. And not long after, without another word, he passed<br/>away.<br/>
