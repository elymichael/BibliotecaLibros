"Only one of the gigs is being manned, sir," I added; "the crew<br/>of the other most likely going round by shore to cut us off."<br/><br/>"They'll have a hot run, sir," returned the captain. "Jack<br/>ashore, you know. It's not them I mind; it's the round-shot. Carpet<br/>bowls! My lady's maid couldn't miss. Tell us, squire, when you see<br/>the match, and we'll hold water."<br/><br/>In the meanwhile we had been making headway at a good pace for a<br/>boat so overloaded, and we had shipped but little water in the<br/>process. We were now close in; thirty or forty strokes and we<br/>should beach her, for the ebb had already disclosed a narrow belt<br/>of sand below the clustering trees. The gig was no longer to be<br/>feared; the little point had already concealed it from our eyes.<br/>The ebb-tide, which had so cruelly delayed us, was now making<br/>reparation and delaying our assailants. The one source of danger<br/>was the gun.<br/><br/>"If I durst," said the captain, "I'd stop and pick off another<br/>man."<br/><br/>But it was plain that they meant nothing should delay their<br/>shot. They had never so much as looked at their fallen comrade,<br/>though he was not dead, and I could see him trying to crawl<br/>away.<br/><br/>"Ready!" cried the squire.<br/><br/>"Hold!" cried the captain, quick as an echo.<br/><br/>And he and Redruth backed with a great heave that sent her stern<br/>bodily under water. The report fell in at the same instant of time.<br/>This was the first that Jim heard, the sound of the squire's shot<br/>not having reached him. Where the ball passed, not one of us<br/>precisely knew, but I fancy it must have been over our heads and<br/>that the wind of it may have contributed to our disaster.<br/><br/>At any rate, the boat sank by the stern, quite gently, in three<br/>feet of water, leaving the captain and myself, facing each other,<br/>on our feet. The other three took complete headers, and came up<br/>again drenched and bubbling.<br/><br/>So far there was no great harm. No lives were lost, and we could<br/>wade ashore in safety. But there were all our stores at the bottom,<br/>and to make things worse, only two guns out of five remained in a<br/>state for service. Mine I had snatched from my knees and held over<br/>my head, by a sort of instinct. As for the captain, he had carried<br/>his over his shoulder by a bandoleer, and like a wise man, lock<br/>uppermost. The other three had gone down with the boat.<br/><br/>To add to our concern, we heard voices already drawing near us<br/>in the woods along shore, and we had not only the danger of being<br/>cut off from the stockade in our half-crippled state but the fear<br/>before us whether, if Hunter and Joyce were attacked by half a<br/>dozen, they would have the sense and conduct to stand firm. Hunter<br/>was steady, that we knew; Joyce was a doubtful caseâ€”a pleasant,<br/>polite man for a valet and to brush one's clothes, but not entirely<br/>fitted for a man of war.<br/>
