<br/>"And lest you should take it into that head of yours," he went<br/>on, "that you was included in the treaty, here's the last word that<br/>was said: 'How many are you,' says I, 'to leave?' 'Four,' says he;<br/>'four, and one of us wounded. As for that boy, I don't know where<br/>he is, confound him,' says he, 'nor I don't much care. We're about<br/>sick of him.' These was his words.<br/><br/>"Is that all?" I asked.<br/><br/>"Well, it's all that you're to hear, my son," returned<br/>Silver.<br/><br/>"And now I am to choose?"<br/><br/>"And now you are to choose, and you may lay to that," said<br/>Silver.<br/><br/>"Well," said I, "I am not such a fool but I know pretty well<br/>what I have to look for. Let the worst come to the worst, it's<br/>little I care. I've seen too many die since I fell in with you. But<br/>there's a thing or two I have to tell you," I said, and by this<br/>time I was quite excited; "and the first is this: here you are, in<br/>a bad way—ship lost, treasure lost, men lost, your whole business<br/>gone to wreck; and if you want to know who did it—it was I! I was<br/>in the apple barrel the night we sighted land, and I heard you,<br/>John, and you, Dick Johnson, and Hands, who is now at the bottom of<br/>the sea, and told every word you said before the hour was out. And<br/>as for the schooner, it was I who cut her cable, and it was I that<br/>killed the men you had aboard of her, and it was I who brought her<br/>where you'll never see her more, not one of you. The laugh's on my<br/>side; I've had the top of this business from the first; I no more<br/>fear you than I fear a fly. Kill me, if you please, or spare me.<br/>But one thing I'll say, and no more; if you spare me, bygones are<br/>bygones, and when you fellows are in court for piracy, I'll save<br/>you all I can. It is for you to choose. Kill another and do<br/>yourselves no good, or spare me and keep a witness to save you from<br/>the gallows."<br/><br/>I stopped, for, I tell you, I was out of breath, and to my<br/>wonder, not a man of them moved, but all sat staring at me like as<br/>many sheep. And while they were still staring, I broke out again,<br/>"And now, Mr. Silver," I said, "I believe you're the best man here,<br/>and if things go to the worst, I'll take it kind of you to let the<br/>doctor know the way I took it."<br/><br/>"I'll bear it in mind," said Silver with an accent so curious<br/>that I could not, for the life of me, decide whether he were<br/>laughing at my request or had been favourably affected by my<br/>courage.<br/><br/>"I'll put one to that," cried the old mahogany-faced<br/>seaman—Morgan by name—whom I had seen in Long John's public-house<br/>upon the quays of Bristol. "It was him that knowed Black Dog."<br/><br/>"Well, and see here," added the sea-cook. "I'll put another<br/>again to that, by thunder! For it was this same boy that faked the<br/>chart from Billy Bones. First and last, we've split upon Jim<br/>Hawkins!"<br/><br/>
