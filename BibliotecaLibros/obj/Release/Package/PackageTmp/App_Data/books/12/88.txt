"If it's the only course that we can lie, sir, we must even lie
it," returned the captain. "We must keep upstream. You see, sir,"
he went on, "if once we dropped to leeward of the landing-place,
it's hard to say where we should get ashore, besides the chance of
being boarded by the gigs; whereas, the way we go the current must
slacken, and then we can dodge back along the shore."

"The current's less a'ready, sir," said the man Gray, who was
sitting in the fore-sheets; "you can ease her off a bit."

"Thank you, my man," said I, quite as if nothing had happened,
for we had all quietly made up our minds to treat him like one of
ourselves.

Suddenly the captain spoke up again, and I thought his voice was
a little changed.

"The gun!" said he.

"I have thought of that," said I, for I made sure he was
thinking of a bombardment of the fort. "They could never get the
gun ashore, and if they did, they could never haul it through the
woods."

"Look astern, doctor," replied the captain.

We had entirely forgotten the long nine; and there, to our
horror, were the five rogues busy about her, getting off her
jacket, as they called the stout tarpaulin cover under which she
sailed. Not only that, but it flashed into my mind at the same
moment that the round-shot and the powder for the gun had been left
behind, and a stroke with an axe would put it all into the
possession of the evil ones abroad.

"Israel was Flint's gunner," said Gray hoarsely.

At any risk, we put the boat's head direct for the
landing-place. By this time we had got so far out of the run of the
current that we kept steerage way even at our necessarily gentle
rate of rowing, and I could keep her steady for the goal. But the
worst of it was that with the course I now held we turned our
broadside instead of our stern to the Hispaniola and offered a
target like a barn door.

I could hear as well as see that brandy-faced rascal Israel
Hands plumping down a round-shot on the deck.
