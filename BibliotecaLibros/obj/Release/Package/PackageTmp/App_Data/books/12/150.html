"Step up, lad," cried Silver. "I won't eat you. Hand it over,<br/>lubber. I know the rules, I do; I won't hurt a depytation." Thus<br/>encouraged, the buccaneer stepped forth more briskly, and having<br/>passed something to Silver, from hand to hand, slipped yet more<br/>smartly back again to his companions.<br/><br/>The sea-cook looked at what had been given him.<br/><br/>"The black spot! I thought so," he observed. "Where might you<br/>have got the paper? Why, hillo! Look here, now; this ain't lucky!<br/>You've gone and cut this out of a Bible. What fool's cut a<br/>Bible?"<br/><br/>"Ah, there!" said Morgan. "There! Wot did I say? No good'll come<br/>o' that, I said."<br/><br/>"Well, you've about fixed it now, among you," continued Silver.<br/>"You'll all swing now, I reckon. What soft-headed lubber had a<br/>Bible?"<br/><br/>"It was Dick," said one.<br/><br/>"Dick, was it? Then Dick can get to prayers," said Silver. "He's<br/>seen his slice of luck, has Dick, and you may lay to that." But<br/>here the long man with the yellow eyes struck in.<br/><br/>"Belay that talk, John Silver," he said. "This crew has tipped<br/>you the black spot in full council, as in dooty bound; just you<br/>turn it over, as in dooty bound, and see what's wrote there. Then<br/>you can talk."<br/><br/>"Thanky, George," replied the sea-cook. "You always was brisk<br/>for business, and has the rules by heart, George, as I'm pleased to<br/>see. Well, what is it, anyway? Ah! 'Deposed'—that's it, is it? Very<br/>pretty wrote, to be sure; like print, I swear. Your hand o' write,<br/>George? Why, you was gettin' quite a leadin' man in this here crew.<br/>You'll be cap'n next, I shouldn't wonder. Just oblige me with that<br/>torch again, will you? This pipe don't draw."<br/><br/>"Come, now," said George, "you don't fool this crew no more.<br/>You're a funny man, by your account; but you're over now, and<br/>you'll maybe step down off that barrel and help vote."<br/><br/>"I thought you said you knowed the rules," returned Silver<br/>contemptuously. "Leastways, if you don't, I do; and I wait here—and<br/>I'm still your cap'n, mind—till you outs with your grievances and I<br/>reply; in the meantime, your black spot ain't worth a biscuit.<br/>After that, we'll see."<br/>
