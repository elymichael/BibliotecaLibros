"He were an ugly devil," cried a third pirate with a shudder;<br/>"that blue in the face too!"<br/><br/>"That was how the rum took him," added Merry. "Blue! Well, I<br/>reckon he was blue. That's a true word."<br/><br/>Ever since they had found the skeleton and got upon this train<br/>of thought, they had spoken lower and lower, and they had almost<br/>got to whispering by now, so that the sound of their talk hardly<br/>interrupted the silence of the wood. All of a sudden, out of the<br/>middle of the trees in front of us, a thin, high, trembling voice<br/>struck up the well-known air and words:<br/><br/>"Fifteen men on the dead man's chest—<br/><br/>Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!"<br/><br/>I never have seen men more dreadfully affected than the pirates.<br/>The colour went from their six faces like enchantment; some leaped<br/>to their feet, some clawed hold of others; Morgan grovelled on the<br/>ground.<br/><br/>"It's Flint, by——!" cried Merry.<br/><br/>The song had stopped as suddenly as it began—broken off, you<br/>would have said, in the middle of a note, as though someone had<br/>laid his hand upon the singer's mouth. Coming through the clear,<br/>sunny atmosphere among the green tree-tops, I thought it had<br/>sounded airily and sweetly; and the effect on my companions was the<br/>stranger.<br/><br/>"Come," said Silver, struggling with his ashen lips to get the<br/>word out; "this won't do. Stand by to go about. This is a rum<br/>start, and I can't name the voice, but it's someone<br/>skylarking—someone that's flesh and blood, and you may lay to<br/>that."<br/><br/>His courage had come back as he spoke, and some of the colour to<br/>his face along with it. Already the others had begun to lend an ear<br/>to this encouragement and were coming a little to themselves, when<br/>the same voice broke out again—not this time singing, but in a<br/>faint distant hail that echoed yet fainter among the clefts of the<br/>Spy-glass.<br/><br/>"Darby M'Graw," it wailed—for that is the word that best<br/>describes the sound—"Darby M'Graw! Darby M'Graw!" again and again<br/>and again; and then rising a little higher, and with an oath that I<br/>leave out: "Fetch aft the rum, Darby!"<br/>
