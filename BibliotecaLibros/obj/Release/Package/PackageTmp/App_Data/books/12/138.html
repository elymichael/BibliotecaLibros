<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>6<br/>"Pieces of Eight"<br/><br/><br/>O<br/>wing to the cant<br/>of the vessel, the masts hung far out over the water, and from my<br/>perch on the cross-trees I had nothing below me but the surface of<br/>the bay. Hands, who was not so far up, was in consequence nearer to<br/>the ship and fell between me and the bulwarks. He rose once to the<br/>surface in a lather of foam and blood and then sank again for good.<br/>As the water settled, I could see him lying huddled together on the<br/>clean, bright sand in the shadow of the vessel's sides. A fish or<br/>two whipped past his body. Sometimes, by the quivering of the<br/>water, he appeared to move a little, as if he were trying to rise.<br/>But he was dead enough, for all that, being both shot and drowned,<br/>and was food for fish in the very place where he had designed my<br/>slaughter.<br/><br/>I was no sooner certain of this than I began to feel sick,<br/>faint, and terrified. The hot blood was running over my back and<br/>chest. The dirk, where it had pinned my shoulder to the mast,<br/>seemed to burn like a hot iron; yet it was not so much these real<br/>sufferings that distressed me, for these, it seemed to me, I could<br/>bear without a murmur; it was the horror I had upon my mind of<br/>falling from the cross-trees into that still green water, beside<br/>the body of the coxswain.<br/><br/>I clung with both hands till my nails ached, and I shut my eyes<br/>as if to cover up the peril. Gradually my mind came back again, my<br/>pulses quieted down to a more natural time, and I was once more in<br/>possession of myself.<br/><br/>It was my first thought to pluck forth the dirk, but either it<br/>stuck too hard or my nerve failed me, and I desisted with a violent<br/>shudder. Oddly enough, that very shudder did the business. The<br/>knife, in fact, had come the nearest in the world to missing me<br/>altogether; it held me by a mere pinch of skin, and this the<br/>shudder tore away. The blood ran down the faster, to be sure, but I<br/>was my own master again and only tacked to the mast by my coat and<br/>shirt.<br/><br/>These last I broke through with a sudden jerk, and then regained<br/>the deck by the starboard shrouds. For nothing in the world would I<br/>have again ventured, shaken as I was, upon the overhanging port<br/>shrouds from which Israel had so lately fallen.<br/><br/>I went below and did what I could for my wound; it pained me a<br/>good deal and still bled freely, but it was neither deep nor<br/>dangerous, nor did it greatly gall me when I used my arm. Then I<br/>looked around me, and as the ship was now, in a sense, my own, I<br/>began to think of clearing it from its last passengerâ€”the dead man,<br/>O'Brien.<br/><br/>
