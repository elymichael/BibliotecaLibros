"Aye," said he, "by thunder, but I wanted some o' that!"

I had sat down already in my own corner and begun to eat.

"Much hurt?" I asked him.

He grunted, or rather, I might say, he barked.

"If that doctor was aboard," he said, "I'd be right enough in a
couple of turns, but I don't have no manner of luck, you see, and
that's what's the matter with me. As for that swab, he's good and
dead, he is," he added, indicating the man with the red cap. "He
warn't no seaman anyhow. And where mought you have come from?"

"Well," said I, "I've come aboard to take possession of this
ship, Mr. Hands; and you'll please regard me as your captain until
further notice."

He looked at me sourly enough but said nothing. Some of the
colour had come back into his cheeks, though he still looked very
sick and still continued to slip out and settle down as the ship
banged about.

"By the by," I continued, "I can't have these colours, Mr.
Hands; and by your leave, I'll strike 'em. Better none than
these."

And again dodging the boom, I ran to the colour lines, handed
down their cursed black flag, and chucked it overboard.

"God save the king!" said I, waving my cap. "And there's an end
to Captain Silver!"
