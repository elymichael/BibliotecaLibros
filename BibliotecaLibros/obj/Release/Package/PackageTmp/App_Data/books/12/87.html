<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>2<br/>Narrative Continued by the Doctor: The Jolly-boat's Last Trip<br/><br/><br/>T<br/>his fifth trip was<br/>quite different from any of the others. In the first place, the<br/>little gallipot of a boat that we were in was gravely overloaded.<br/>Five grown men, and three of them—Trelawney, Redruth, and the<br/>captain—over six feet high, was already more than she was meant to<br/>carry. Add to that the powder, pork, and bread-bags. The gunwale<br/>was lipping astern. Several times we shipped a little water, and my<br/>breeches and the tails of my coat were all soaking wet before we<br/>had gone a hundred yards.<br/><br/>The captain made us trim the boat, and we got her to lie a<br/>little more evenly. All the same, we were afraid to breathe.<br/><br/>In the second place, the ebb was now making—a strong rippling<br/>current running westward through the basin, and then south'ard and<br/>seaward down the straits by which we had entered in the morning.<br/>Even the ripples were a danger to our overloaded craft, but the<br/>worst of it was that we were swept out of our true course and away<br/>from our proper landing-place behind the point. If we let the<br/>current have its way we should come ashore beside the gigs, where<br/>the pirates might appear at any moment.<br/><br/>"I cannot keep her head for the stockade, sir," said I to the<br/>captain. I was steering, while he and Redruth, two fresh men, were<br/>at the oars. "The tide keeps washing her down. Could you pull a<br/>little stronger?"<br/><br/>"Not without swamping the boat," said he. "You must bear up,<br/>sir, if you please—bear up until you see you're gaining." I tried<br/>and found by experiment that the tide kept sweeping us westward<br/>until I had laid her head due east, or just about right angles to<br/>the way we ought to go.<br/><br/>"We'll never get ashore at this rate," said I.<br/><br/>
