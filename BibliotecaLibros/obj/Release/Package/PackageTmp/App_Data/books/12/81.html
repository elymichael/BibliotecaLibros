"Ah," said he, "that's the hitch, for sure. Well, there's my<br/>boat, that I made with my two hands. I keep her under the white<br/>rock. If the worst come to the worst, we might try that after dark.<br/>Hi!" he broke out. "What's that?"<br/><br/>For just then, although the sun had still an hour or two to run,<br/>all the echoes of the island awoke and bellowed to the thunder of a<br/>cannon.<br/><br/>"They have begun to fight!" I cried.
