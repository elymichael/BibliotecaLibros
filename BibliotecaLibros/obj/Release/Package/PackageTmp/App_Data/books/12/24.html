<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>5<br/>The Last of the Blind Man<br/><br/><br/>M<br/>y curiosity, in a<br/>sense, was stronger than my fear, for I could not remain where I<br/>was, but crept back to the bank again, whence, sheltering my head<br/>behind a bush of broom, I might command the road before our door. I<br/>was scarcely in position ere my enemies began to arrive, seven or<br/>eight of them, running hard, their feet beating out of time along<br/>the road and the man with the lantern some paces in front. Three<br/>men ran together, hand in hand; and I made out, even through the<br/>mist, that the middle man of this trio was the blind beggar. The<br/>next moment his voice showed me that I was right.<br/><br/>"Down with the door!" he cried.<br/><br/>"Aye, aye, sir!" answered two or three; and a rush was made upon<br/>the Admiral Benbow, the lantern-bearer following; and then I could<br/>see them pause, and hear speeches passed in a lower key, as if they<br/>were surprised to find the door open. But the pause was brief, for<br/>the blind man again issued his commands. His voice sounded louder<br/>and higher, as if he were afire with eagerness and rage.<br/><br/>"In, in, in!" he shouted, and cursed them for their delay.<br/><br/>Four or five of them obeyed at once, two remaining on the road<br/>with the formidable beggar. There was a pause, then a cry of<br/>surprise, and then a voice shouting from the house, "Bill's<br/>dead."<br/><br/>But the blind man swore at them again for their delay.<br/><br/>
