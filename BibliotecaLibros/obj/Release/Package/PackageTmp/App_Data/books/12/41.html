<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>2<br/>At<br/>the Sign of the Spy-glass<br/><br/><br/>W<br/>hen I had done<br/>breakfasting the squire gave me a note addressed to John Silver, at<br/>the sign of the Spy-glass, and told me I should easily find the<br/>place by following the line of the docks and keeping a bright<br/>lookout for a little tavern with a large brass telescope for sign.<br/>I set off, overjoyed at this opportunity to see some more of the<br/>ships and seamen, and picked my way among a great crowd of people<br/>and carts and bales, for the dock was now at its busiest, until I<br/>found the tavern in question.<br/><br/>It was a bright enough little place of entertainment. The sign<br/>was newly painted; the windows had neat red curtains; the floor was<br/>cleanly sanded. There was a street on each side and an open door on<br/>both, which made the large, low room pretty clear to see in, in<br/>spite of clouds of tobacco smoke.<br/><br/>The customers were mostly seafaring men, and they talked so<br/>loudly that I hung at the door, almost afraid to enter.<br/><br/>As I was waiting, a man came out of a side room, and at a glance<br/>I was sure he must be Long John. His left leg was cut off close by<br/>the hip, and under the left shoulder he carried a crutch, which he<br/>managed with wonderful dexterity, hopping about upon it like a<br/>bird. He was very tall and strong, with a face as big as a<br/>ham—plain and pale, but intelligent and smiling. Indeed, he seemed<br/>in the most cheerful spirits, whistling as he moved about among the<br/>tables, with a merry word or a slap on the shoulder for the more<br/>favoured of his guests.<br/><br/>Now, to tell you the truth, from the very first mention of Long<br/>John in Squire Trelawney's letter I had taken a fear in my mind<br/>that he might prove to be the very one-legged sailor whom I had<br/>watched for so long at the old Benbow. But one look at the man<br/>before me was enough. I had seen the captain, and Black Dog, and<br/>the blind man, Pew, and I thought I knew what a buccaneer was<br/>like—a very different creature, according to me, from this clean<br/>and pleasant-tempered landlord.<br/><br/>I plucked up courage at once, crossed the threshold, and walked<br/>right up to the man where he stood, propped on his crutch, talking<br/>to a customer.<br/><br/>
