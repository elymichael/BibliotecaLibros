David Livesey, ship's&#160;doctor;<br/><br/>Abraham Gray, carpenter's mate;<br/><br/>John&#160;Trelawney, owner;<br/><br/>John Hunter and Richard Joyce,&#160;owner's<br/>servants,&#160;landsmen—being all that is left&#160;faithful of the<br/>ship's company—with stores for ten&#160;days at short rations, came<br/>ashore this day and flew&#160;British colours on the log-house in<br/>Treasure Island.<br/><br/>Thomas Redruth, owner's servant, landsman, shot by<br/>the&#160;mutineers;<br/><br/>James Hawkins, cabin-boy—<br/><br/><br/>And at the same time, I was wondering over poor Jim Hawkins'<br/>fate.<br/><br/>A hail on the land side.<br/><br/>"Somebody hailing us," said Hunter, who was on guard.<br/><br/>"Doctor! Squire! Captain! Hullo, Hunter, is that you?" came the<br/>cries.<br/><br/>
