<br/>"Oh," replied George, "you don't be under no kind of<br/>apprehension; we're all square, we are. First, you've made a hash<br/>of this cruise—you'll be a bold man to say no to that. Second, you<br/>let the enemy out o' this here trap for nothing. Why did they want<br/>out? I dunno, but it's pretty plain they wanted it. Third, you<br/>wouldn't let us go at them upon the march. Oh, we see through you,<br/>John Silver; you want to play booty, that's what's wrong with you.<br/>And then, fourth, there's this here boy."<br/><br/>"Is that all?" asked Silver quietly.<br/><br/>"Enough, too," retorted George. "We'll all swing and sun-dry for<br/>your bungling."<br/><br/>"Well now, look here, I'll answer these four p'ints; one after<br/>another I'll answer 'em. I made a hash o' this cruise, did I? Well<br/>now, you all know what I wanted, and you all know if that had been<br/>done that we'd 'a been aboard the Hispaniola this night as ever<br/>was, every man of us alive, and fit, and full of good plum-duff,<br/>and the treasure in the hold of her, by thunder! Well, who crossed<br/>me? Who forced my hand, as was the lawful cap'n? Who tipped me the<br/>black spot the day we landed and began this dance? Ah, it's a fine<br/>dance—I'm with you there—and looks mighty like a hornpipe in a<br/>rope's end at Execution Dock by London town, it does. But who done<br/>it? Why, it was Anderson, and Hands, and you, George Merry! And<br/>you're the last above board of that same meddling crew; and you<br/>have the Davy Jones's insolence to up and stand for cap'n over<br/>me—you, that sank the lot of us! By the powers! But this tops the<br/>stiffest yarn to nothing."<br/><br/>Silver paused, and I could see by the faces of George and his<br/>late comrades that these words had not been said in vain.<br/><br/>"That's for number one," cried the accused, wiping the sweat<br/>from his brow, for he had been talking with a vehemence that shook<br/>the house. "Why, I give you my word, I'm sick to speak to you.<br/>You've neither sense nor memory, and I leave it to fancy where your<br/>mothers was that let you come to sea. Sea! Gentlemen o' fortune! I<br/>reckon tailors is your trade."<br/><br/>"Go on, John," said Morgan. "Speak up to the others."<br/><br/>"Ah, the others!" returned John. "They're a nice lot, ain't<br/>they? You say this cruise is bungled. Ah! By gum, if you could<br/>understand how bad it's bungled, you would see! We're that near the<br/>gibbet that my neck's stiff with thinking on it. You've seen 'em,<br/>maybe, hanged in chains, birds about 'em, seamen p'inting 'em out<br/>as they go down with the tide. 'Who's that?' says one. 'That! Why,<br/>that's John Silver. I knowed him well,' says another. And you can<br/>hear the chains a-jangle as you go about and reach for the other<br/>buoy. Now, that's about where we are, every mother's son of us,<br/>thanks to him, and Hands, and Anderson, and other ruination fools<br/>of you. And if you want to know about number four, and that boy,<br/>why, shiver my timbers, isn't he a hostage? Are we a-going to waste<br/>a hostage? No, not us; he might be our last chance, and I shouldn't<br/>wonder. Kill that boy? Not me, mates! And number three? Ah, well,<br/>there's a deal to say to number three. Maybe you don't count it<br/>nothing to have a real college doctor to see you every day—you,<br/>John, with your head broke—or you, George Merry, that had the ague<br/>shakes upon you not six hours agone, and has your eyes the colour<br/>of lemon peel to this same moment on the clock? And maybe, perhaps,<br/>you didn't know there was a consort coming either? But there is,<br/>and not so long till then; and we'll see who'll be glad to have a<br/>hostage when it comes to that. And as for number two, and why I<br/>made a bargain—well, you came crawling on your knees to me to make<br/>it—on your knees you came, you was that downhearted—and you'd have<br/>starved too if I hadn't—but that's a trifle! You look there—that's<br/>why!"<br/><br/>And he cast down upon the floor a paper that I instantly<br/>recognized—none other than the chart on yellow paper, with the<br/>three red crosses, that I had found in the oilcloth at the bottom<br/>of the captain's chest. Why the doctor had given it to him was more<br/>than I could fancy.<br/><br/>But if it were inexplicable to me, the appearance of the chart<br/>was incredible to the surviving mutineers. They leaped upon it like<br/>cats upon a mouse. It went from hand to hand, one tearing it from<br/>another; and by the oaths and the cries and the childish laughter<br/>with which they accompanied their examination, you would have<br/>thought, not only they were fingering the very gold, but were at<br/>sea with it, besides, in safety.<br/><br/>
