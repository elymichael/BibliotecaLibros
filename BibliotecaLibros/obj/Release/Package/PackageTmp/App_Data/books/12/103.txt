Silver's Embassy


S
ure enough, there
were two men just outside the stockade, one of them waving a white
cloth, the other, no less a person than Silver himself, standing
placidly by.

It was still quite early, and the coldest morning that I think I
ever was abroad inâ€”a chill that pierced into the marrow. The sky
was bright and cloudless overhead, and the tops of the trees shone
rosily in the sun. But where Silver stood with his lieutenant, all
was still in shadow, and they waded knee-deep in a low white vapour
that had crawled during the night out of the morass. The chill and
the vapour taken together told a poor tale of the island. It was
plainly a damp, feverish, unhealthy spot.

"Keep indoors, men," said the captain. "Ten to one this is a
trick."

Then he hailed the buccaneer.

"Who goes? Stand, or we fire."

"Flag of truce," cried Silver.
