<br/>The Hispaniola was under her main-sail and two jibs, and the<br/>beautiful white canvas shone in the sun like snow or silver. When I<br/>first sighted her, all her sails were drawing; she was lying a<br/>course about north-west, and I presumed the men on board were going<br/>round the island on their way back to the anchorage. Presently she<br/>began to fetch more and more to the westward, so that I thought<br/>they had sighted me and were going about in chase. At last,<br/>however, she fell right into the wind's eye, was taken dead aback,<br/>and stood there awhile helpless, with her sails shivering.<br/><br/>"Clumsy fellows," said I; "they must still be drunk as owls."<br/>And I thought how Captain Smollett would have set them<br/>skipping.<br/><br/>Meanwhile the schooner gradually fell off and filled again upon<br/>another tack, sailed swiftly for a minute or so, and brought up<br/>once more dead in the wind's eye. Again and again was this<br/>repeated. To and fro, up and down, north, south, east, and west,<br/>the Hispaniola sailed by swoops and dashes, and at each repetition<br/>ended as she had begun, with idly flapping canvas. It became plain<br/>to me that nobody was steering. And if so, where were the men?<br/>Either they were dead drunk or had deserted her, I thought, and<br/>perhaps if I could get on board I might return the vessel to her<br/>captain.<br/><br/>The current was bearing coracle and schooner southward at an<br/>equal rate. As for the latter's sailing, it was so wild and<br/>intermittent, and she hung each time so long in irons, that she<br/>certainly gained nothing, if she did not even lose. If only I dared<br/>to sit up and paddle, I made sure that I could overhaul her. The<br/>scheme had an air of adventure that inspired me, and the thought of<br/>the water breaker beside the fore companion doubled my growing<br/>courage.<br/><br/>Up I got, was welcomed almost instantly by another cloud of<br/>spray, but this time stuck to my purpose and set myself, with all<br/>my strength and caution, to paddle after the unsteered Hispaniola.<br/>Once I shipped a sea so heavy that I had to stop and bail, with my<br/>heart fluttering like a bird, but gradually I got into the way of<br/>the thing and guided my coracle among the waves, with only now and<br/>then a blow upon her bows and a dash of foam in my face.<br/><br/>I was now gaining rapidly on the schooner; I could see the brass<br/>glisten on the tiller as it banged about, and still no soul<br/>appeared upon her decks. I could not choose but suppose she was<br/>deserted. If not, the men were lying drunk below, where I might<br/>batten them down, perhaps, and do what I chose with the ship.<br/><br/>For some time she had been doing the worse thing possible for<br/>meâ€”standing still. She headed nearly due south, yawing, of course,<br/>all the time. Each time she fell off, her sails partly filled, and<br/>these brought her in a moment right to the wind again. I have said<br/>this was the worst thing possible for me, for helpless as she<br/>looked in this situation, with the canvas cracking like cannon and<br/>the blocks trundling and banging on the deck, she still continued<br/>to run away from me, not only with the speed of the current, but by<br/>the whole amount of her leeway, which was naturally great.<br/><br/>But now, at last, I had my chance. The breeze fell for some<br/>seconds, very low, and the current gradually turning her, the<br/>Hispaniola revolved slowly round her centre and at last presented<br/>me her stern, with the cabin window still gaping open and the lamp<br/>over the table still burning on into the day. The main-sail hung<br/>drooped like a banner. She was stock-still but for the current.<br/><br/>For the last little while I had even lost, but now redoubling my<br/>efforts, I began once more to overhaul the chase.<br/><br/>I was not a hundred yards from her when the wind came again in a<br/>clap; she filled on the port tack and was off again, stooping and<br/>skimming like a swallow.<br/><br/>
