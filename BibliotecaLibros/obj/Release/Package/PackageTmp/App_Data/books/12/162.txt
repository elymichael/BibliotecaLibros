A tall tree was thus the principal mark. Now, right before us
the anchorage was bounded by a plateau from two to three hundred
feet high, adjoining on the north the sloping southern shoulder of
the Spy-glass and rising again towards the south into the rough,
cliffy eminence called the Mizzen-mast Hill. The top of the plateau
was dotted thickly with pine-trees of varying height. Every here
and there, one of a different species rose forty or fifty feet
clear above its neighbours, and which of these was the particular
"tall tree" of Captain Flint could only be decided on the spot, and
by the readings of the compass.

Yet, although that was the case, every man on board the boats
had picked a favourite of his own ere we were half-way over, Long
John alone shrugging his shoulders and bidding them wait till they
were there.

We pulled easily, by Silver's directions, not to weary the hands
prematurely, and after quite a long passage, landed at the mouth of
the second river—that which runs down a woody cleft of the
Spy-glass. Thence, bending to our left, we began to ascend the
slope towards the plateau.

At the first outset, heavy, miry ground and a matted, marish
vegetation greatly delayed our progress; but by little and little
the hill began to steepen and become stony under foot, and the wood
to change its character and to grow in a more open order. It was,
indeed, a most pleasant portion of the island that we were now
approaching. A heavy-scented broom and many flowering shrubs had
almost taken the place of grass. Thickets of green nutmeg-trees
were dotted here and there with the red columns and the broad
shadow of the pines; and the first mingled their spice with the
aroma of the others. The air, besides, was fresh and stirring, and
this, under the sheer sunbeams, was a wonderful refreshment to our
senses.

The party spread itself abroad, in a fan shape, shouting and
leaping to and fro. About the centre, and a good way behind the
rest, Silver and I followed—I tethered by my rope, he ploughing,
with deep pants, among the sliding gravel. From time to time,
indeed, I had to lend him a hand, or he must have missed his
footing and fallen backward down the hill.

We had thus proceeded for about half a mile and were approaching
the brow of the plateau when the man upon the farthest left began
to cry aloud, as if in terror. Shout after shout came from him, and
the others began to run in his direction.

"He can't 'a found the treasure," said old Morgan, hurrying past
us from the right, "for that's clean a-top."

Indeed, as we found when we also reached the spot, it was
something very different. At the foot of a pretty big pine and
involved in a green creeper, which had even partly lifted some of
the smaller bones, a human skeleton lay, with a few shreds of
clothing, on the ground. I believe a chill struck for a moment to
every heart.

"He was a seaman," said George Merry, who, bolder than the rest,
had gone up close and was examining the rags of clothing.
"Leastways, this is good sea-cloth."

"Aye, aye," said Silver; "like enough; you wouldn't look to find
a bishop here, I reckon. But what sort of a way is that for bones
to lie? 'Tain't in natur'."
