Hath the fellow any wit that told you this?


ANTONIO


A good sharp fellow: I will send for him; and
question him yourself.


LEONATO


No, no; we will hold it as a dream till it appear
itself: but I will acquaint my daughter withal,
that she may be the better prepared for an answer,
if peradventure this be true. Go you and tell her of it.
