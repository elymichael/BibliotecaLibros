Go, I discharge thee of thy prisoner, and I thank
thee.


DOGBERRY


I leave an arrant knave with your worship; which I
beseech your worship to correct yourself, for the
example of others. God keep your worship! I wish
your worship well; God restore you to health! I
humbly give you leave to depart; and if a merry
meeting may be wished, God prohibit it! Come, neighbour.

Exeunt DOGBERRY and VERGES


LEONATO


Until to-morrow morning, lords, farewell.
