Sweet Beatrice, wouldst thou come when I called thee?<br/><br/><br/>BEATRICE<br/><br/><br/>Yea, signior, and depart when you bid me.<br/><br/><br/>BENEDICK<br/><br/><br/>O, stay but till then!<br/><br/><br/>BEATRICE<br/><br/><br/>'Then' is spoken; fare you well now: and yet, ere<br/>I go, let me go with that I came; which is, with<br/>knowing what hath passed between you and Claudio.<br/>
