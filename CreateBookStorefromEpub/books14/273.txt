FRIAR FRANCIS


'Tis well consented: presently away;
For to strange sores strangely they strain the cure.
Come, lady, die to live: this wedding-day
Perhaps is but prolong'd: have patience and endure.

Exeunt all but BENEDICK and BEATRICE


BENEDICK


Lady Beatrice, have you wept all this while?


BEATRICE


Yea, and I will weep a while longer.
