I will assume thy part in some disguise<br/>And tell fair Hero I am Claudio,<br/>And in her bosom I'll unclasp my heart<br/>And take her hearing prisoner with the force<br/>And strong encounter of my amorous tale:<br/>Then after to her father will I break;<br/>And the conclusion is, she shall be thine.<br/>In practise let us put it presently.<br/><br/>Exeunt<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
