<br/>If you meet a thief, you may suspect him, by virtue<br/>of your office, to be no true man; and, for such<br/>kind of men, the less you meddle or make with them,<br/>why the more is for your honesty.<br/><br/><br/>Watchman<br/><br/><br/>If we know him to be a thief, shall we not lay<br/>hands on him?<br/><br/><br/>DOGBERRY<br/><br/><br/>Truly, by your office, you may; but I think they<br/>that touch pitch will be defiled: the most peaceable<br/>way for you, if you do take a thief, is to let him<br/>show himself what he is and steal out of your company.<br/>
