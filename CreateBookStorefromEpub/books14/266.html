Against her maiden truth. Call me a fool;<br/>Trust not my reading nor my observations,<br/>Which with experimental seal doth warrant<br/>The tenor of my book; trust not my age,<br/>My reverence, calling, nor divinity,<br/>If this sweet lady lie not guiltless here<br/>Under some biting error.<br/><br/><br/>LEONATO<br/><br/><br/>Friar, it cannot be.<br/>Thou seest that all the grace that she hath left<br/>Is that she will not add to her damnation<br/>A sin of perjury; she not denies it:<br/>Why seek'st thou then to cover with excuse<br/>That which appears in proper nakedness?<br/><br/><br/>FRIAR FRANCIS<br/>
