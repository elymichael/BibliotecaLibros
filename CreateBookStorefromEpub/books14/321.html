<br/>What, courage, man! What though care killed a cat,<br/>thou hast mettle enough in thee to kill care.<br/><br/><br/>BENEDICK<br/><br/><br/>Sir, I shall meet your wit in the career, and you<br/>charge it against me. I pray you choose another subject.<br/><br/><br/>CLAUDIO<br/><br/><br/>Nay, then, give him another staff: this last was<br/>broke cross.<br/><br/><br/>DON PEDRO<br/><br/>
