<br/><br/>I pray thee, cease thy counsel,<br/>Which falls into mine ears as profitless<br/>As water in a sieve: give not me counsel;<br/>Nor let no comforter delight mine ear<br/>But such a one whose wrongs do suit with mine.<br/>Bring me a father that so loved his child,<br/>Whose joy of her is overwhelm'd like mine,<br/>And bid him speak of patience;<br/>Measure his woe the length and breadth of mine<br/>And let it answer every strain for strain,<br/>As thus for thus and such a grief for such,<br/>In every lineament, branch, shape, and form:<br/>If such a one will smile and stroke his beard,<br/>Bid sorrow wag, cry 'hem!' when he should groan,<br/>Patch grief with proverbs, make misfortune drunk<br/>With candle-wasters; bring him yet to me,<br/>And I of him will gather patience.<br/>But there is no such man: for, brother, men<br/>Can counsel and speak comfort to that grief<br/>
