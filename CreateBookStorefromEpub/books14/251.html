No, Leonato,<br/>I never tempted her with word too large;<br/>But, as a brother to his sister, show'd<br/>Bashful sincerity and comely love.<br/><br/><br/>HERO<br/><br/><br/>And seem'd I ever otherwise to you?<br/><br/><br/>CLAUDIO<br/><br/><br/>Out on thee! Seeming! I will write against it:<br/>You seem to me as Dian in her orb,<br/>As chaste as is the bud ere it be blown;<br/>But you are more intemperate in your blood<br/>Than Venus, or those pamper'd animals<br/>That rage in savage sensuality.<br/>
