<br/><br/>DON JOHN<br/><br/><br/>What life is in that, to be the death of this<br/>marriage?<br/><br/><br/>BORACHIO<br/><br/><br/>The poison of that lies in you to temper. Go you to<br/>the prince your brother; spare not to tell him that<br/>he hath wronged his honour in marrying the renowned<br/>Claudio—whose estimation do you mightily hold<br/>up—to a contaminated stale, such a one as Hero.<br/><br/><br/>DON JOHN<br/><br/><br/>
