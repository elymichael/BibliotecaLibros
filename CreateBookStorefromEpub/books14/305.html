<br/>I pray thee, peace. I will be flesh and blood;<br/>For there was never yet philosopher<br/>That could endure the toothache patiently,<br/>However they have writ the style of gods<br/>And made a push at chance and sufferance.<br/><br/><br/>ANTONIO<br/><br/><br/>Yet bend not all the harm upon yourself;<br/>Make those that do offend you suffer too.<br/><br/><br/>LEONATO<br/><br/><br/>There thou speak'st reason: nay, I will do so.<br/>My soul doth tell me Hero is belied;<br/>And that shall Claudio know; so shall the prince<br/>
