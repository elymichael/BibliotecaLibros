As Beatrice is, cannot be commendable:<br/>But who dare tell her so? If I should speak,<br/>She would mock me into air; O, she would laugh me<br/>Out of myself, press me to death with wit.<br/>Therefore let Benedick, like cover'd fire,<br/>Consume away in sighs, waste inwardly:<br/>It were a better death than die with mocks,<br/>Which is as bad as die with tickling.<br/><br/><br/>URSULA<br/><br/><br/>Yet tell her of it: hear what she will say.<br/><br/><br/>HERO<br/><br/><br/>No; rather I will go to Benedick<br/>And counsel him to fight against his passion.<br/>
