<br/>BEATRICE<br/><br/><br/>In spite of your heart, I think; alas, poor heart!<br/>If you spite it for my sake, I will spite it for<br/>yours; for I will never love that which my friend hates.<br/><br/><br/>BENEDICK<br/><br/><br/>Thou and I are too wise to woo peaceably.<br/><br/><br/>BEATRICE<br/><br/><br/>It appears not in this confession: there's not one<br/>wise man among twenty that will praise himself.<br/><br/>
