<br/>What is it, my good friends?<br/><br/><br/>DOGBERRY<br/><br/><br/>Goodman Verges, sir, speaks a little off the<br/>matter: an old man, sir, and his wits are not so<br/>blunt as, God help, I would desire they were; but,<br/>in faith, honest as the skin between his brows.<br/><br/><br/>VERGES<br/><br/><br/>Yes, I thank God I am as honest as any man living<br/>that is an old man and no honester than I.<br/><br/><br/>DOGBERRY<br/>
