<br/>Yea, as sure as I have a thought or a soul.<br/><br/><br/>BENEDICK<br/><br/><br/>Enough, I am engaged; I will challenge him. I will<br/>kiss your hand, and so I leave you. By this hand,<br/>Claudio shall render me a dear account. As you<br/>hear of me, so think of me. Go, comfort your<br/>cousin: I must say she is dead: and so, farewell.<br/><br/>Exeunt<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
