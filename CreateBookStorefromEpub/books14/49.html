<br/><br/>LEONATO<br/><br/><br/>Are they good?<br/><br/><br/>ANTONIO<br/><br/><br/>As the event stamps them: but they have a good<br/>cover; they show well outward. The prince and Count<br/>Claudio, walking in a thick-pleached alley in mine<br/>orchard, were thus much overheard by a man of mine:<br/>the prince discovered to Claudio that he loved my<br/>niece your daughter and meant to acknowledge it<br/>this night in a dance: and if he found her<br/>accordant, he meant to take the present time by the<br/>top and instantly break with you of it.<br/><br/>
