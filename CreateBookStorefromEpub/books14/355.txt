BEATRICE


In spite of your heart, I think; alas, poor heart!
If you spite it for my sake, I will spite it for
yours; for I will never love that which my friend hates.


BENEDICK


Thou and I are too wise to woo peaceably.


BEATRICE


It appears not in this confession: there's not one
wise man among twenty that will praise himself.
