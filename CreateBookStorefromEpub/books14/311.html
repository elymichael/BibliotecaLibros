Thine, Claudio; thine, I say.<br/><br/><br/>DON PEDRO<br/><br/><br/>You say not right, old man.<br/><br/><br/>LEONATO<br/><br/><br/>My lord, my lord,<br/>I'll prove it on his body, if he dare,<br/>Despite his nice fence and his active practise,<br/>His May of youth and bloom of lustihood.<br/><br/><br/>CLAUDIO<br/><br/><br/>
