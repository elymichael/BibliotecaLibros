Nor my bad life reft me so much of friends,<br/>But they shall find, awaked in such a kind,<br/>Both strength of limb and policy of mind,<br/>Ability in means and choice of friends,<br/>To quit me of them throughly.<br/><br/><br/>FRIAR FRANCIS<br/><br/><br/>Pause awhile,<br/>And let my counsel sway you in this case.<br/>Your daughter here the princes left for dead:<br/>Let her awhile be secretly kept in,<br/>And publish it that she is dead indeed;<br/>Maintain a mourning ostentation<br/>And on your family's old monument<br/>Hang mournful epitaphs and do all rites<br/>That appertain unto a burial.<br/><br/><br/>
