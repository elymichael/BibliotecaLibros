Let me but move one question to your daughter;<br/>And, by that fatherly and kindly power<br/>That you have in her, bid her answer truly.<br/><br/><br/>LEONATO<br/><br/><br/>I charge thee do so, as thou art my child.<br/><br/><br/>HERO<br/><br/><br/>O, God defend me! how am I beset!<br/>What kind of catechising call you this?<br/><br/><br/>CLAUDIO<br/><br/><br/>
