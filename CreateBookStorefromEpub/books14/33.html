<br/><br/>I charge thee on thy allegiance.<br/><br/><br/>BENEDICK<br/><br/><br/>You hear, Count Claudio: I can be secret as a dumb<br/>man; I would have you think so; but, on my<br/>allegiance, mark you this, on my allegiance. He is<br/>in love. With who? now that is your grace's part.<br/>Mark how short his answer is;â€”With Hero, Leonato's<br/>short daughter.<br/><br/><br/>CLAUDIO<br/><br/><br/>If this were so, so were it uttered.<br/><br/>
