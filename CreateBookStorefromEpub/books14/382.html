<br/>Come, cousin, I am sure you love the gentleman.<br/><br/><br/>CLAUDIO<br/><br/><br/>And I'll be sworn upon't that he loves her;<br/>For here's a paper written in his hand,<br/>A halting sonnet of his own pure brain,<br/>Fashion'd to Beatrice.<br/><br/><br/>HERO<br/><br/><br/>And here's another<br/>Writ in my cousin's hand, stolen from her pocket,<br/>Containing her affection unto Benedick.<br/><br/><br/>
