<br/><br/>Thus answer I in the name of Benedick,<br/>But hear these ill news with the ears of Claudio.<br/>'Tis certain so; the prince wooes for himself.<br/>Friendship is constant in all other things<br/>Save in the office and affairs of love:<br/>Therefore, all hearts in love use their own tongues;<br/>Let every eye negotiate for itself<br/>And trust no agent; for beauty is a witch<br/>Against whose charms faith melteth into blood.<br/>This is an accident of hourly proof,<br/>Which I mistrusted not. Farewell, therefore, Hero!<br/><br/>Re-enter BENEDICK<br/><br/><br/>BENEDICK<br/><br/><br/>Count Claudio?<br/>
