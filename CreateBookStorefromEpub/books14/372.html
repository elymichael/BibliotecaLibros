Good morrow to this fair assembly.<br/><br/><br/>LEONATO<br/><br/><br/>Good morrow, prince; good morrow, Claudio:<br/>We here attend you. Are you yet determined<br/>To-day to marry with my brother's daughter?<br/><br/><br/>CLAUDIO<br/><br/><br/>I'll hold my mind, were she an Ethiope.<br/><br/><br/>LEONATO<br/><br/><br/>Call her forth, brother; here's the friar ready.<br/>
