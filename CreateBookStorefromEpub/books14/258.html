Fie, fie! they are not to be named, my lord,<br/>Not to be spoke of;<br/>There is not chastity enough in language<br/>Without offence to utter them. Thus, pretty lady,<br/>I am sorry for thy much misgovernment.<br/><br/><br/>CLAUDIO<br/><br/><br/>O Hero, what a Hero hadst thou been,<br/>If half thy outward graces had been placed<br/>About thy thoughts and counsels of thy heart!<br/>But fare thee well, most foul, most fair! farewell,<br/>Thou pure impiety and impious purity!<br/>For thee I'll lock up all the gates of love,<br/>And on my eyelids shall conjecture hang,<br/>To turn all beauty into thoughts of harm,<br/>And never shall it more be gracious.<br/><br/><br/>
