<br/>BEATRICE<br/><br/><br/>Speak, count, 'tis your cue.<br/><br/><br/>CLAUDIO<br/><br/><br/>Silence is the perfectest herald of joy: I were<br/>but little happy, if I could say how much. Lady, as<br/>you are mine, I am yours: I give away myself for<br/>you and dote upon the exchange.<br/><br/><br/>BEATRICE<br/><br/><br/>Speak, cousin; or, if you cannot, stop his mouth<br/>with a kiss, and let not him speak neither.<br/>
