Marry, thou dost wrong me; thou dissembler, thou:â€”
Nay, never lay thy hand upon thy sword;

If it should give your age such cause of fear:
In faith, my hand meant nothing to my sword.

I speak not like a dotard nor a fool,
As under privilege of age to brag
What I have done being young, or what would do
