Sweet prince, you learn me noble thankfulness.<br/>There, Leonato, take her back again:<br/>Give not this rotten orange to your friend;<br/>She's but the sign and semblance of her honour.<br/>Behold how like a maid she blushes here!<br/>O, what authority and show of truth<br/>Can cunning sin cover itself withal!<br/>Comes not that blood as modest evidence<br/>To witness simple virtue? Would you not swear,<br/>All you that see her, that she were a maid,<br/>By these exterior shows? But she is none:<br/>She knows the heat of a luxurious bed;<br/>Her blush is guiltiness, not modesty.<br/><br/><br/>LEONATO<br/><br/><br/>What do you mean, my lord?<br/><br/><br/>
