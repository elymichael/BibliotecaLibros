Go, I discharge thee of thy prisoner, and I thank<br/>thee.<br/><br/><br/>DOGBERRY<br/><br/><br/>I leave an arrant knave with your worship; which I<br/>beseech your worship to correct yourself, for the<br/>example of others. God keep your worship! I wish<br/>your worship well; God restore you to health! I<br/>humbly give you leave to depart; and if a merry<br/>meeting may be wished, God prohibit it! Come, neighbour.<br/><br/>Exeunt DOGBERRY and VERGES<br/><br/><br/>LEONATO<br/><br/><br/>Until to-morrow morning, lords, farewell.<br/><br/>
