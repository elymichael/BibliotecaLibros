URSULA


I pray you, be not angry with me, madam,
Speaking my fancy: Signior Benedick,
For shape, for bearing, argument and valour,
Goes foremost in report through Italy.


HERO


Indeed, he hath an excellent good name.


URSULA


His excellence did earn it, ere he had it.
When are you married, madam?
