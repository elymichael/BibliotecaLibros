"Run away! Well, you would be a nice old slouch of a hermit.
You'd be a disgrace."

The Red-Handed made no response, being better employed. He had
finished gouging out a cob, and now he fitted a weed stem to it,
loaded it with tobacco, and was pressing a coal to the charge and
blowing a cloud of fragrant smoke — he was in the full bloom of
luxurious contentment. The other pirates envied him this majestic
vice, and secretly resolved to acquire it shortly. Presently Huck
said:

"What does pirates have to do?"

Tom said:

"Oh, they have just a bully time — take ships and burn them, and
get the money and bury it in awful places in their island where
there's ghosts and things to watch it, and kill everybody in the
ships — make 'em walk a plank."

"And they carry the women to the island," said Joe; "they don't
kill the women."

"No," assented Tom, "they don't kill the women — they're too
noble. And the women's always beautiful, too.

"And don't they wear the bulliest clothes! Oh no! All gold and
silver and di'monds," said Joe, with enthusiasm.

"Who?" said Huck.

"Why, the pirates."

Huck scanned his own clothing forlornly.
