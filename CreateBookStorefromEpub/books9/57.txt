"Oh, no, now. Please, Becky — I'll whisper it, I'll whisper it
ever so easy."

Becky hesitating, Tom took silence for consent, and passed his
arm about her waist and whispered the tale ever so softly, with his
mouth close to her ear. And then he added:

"Now you whisper it to me — just the same."

She resisted, for a while, and then said:

"You turn your face away so you can't see, and then I will. But
you mustn't ever tell anybody — Will you, Tom? Now you won't, will
you?"

"No, indeed, indeed I won't. Now, Becky."

He turned his face away. She bent timidly around till her breath
stirred his curls and whispered, "I — love — you!"

Then she sprang away and ran around and around the desks and
benches, with Tom after her, and took refuge in a corner at last,
with her little white apron to her face. Tom clasped her about her
neck and pleaded:

"Now, Becky, it's all done — all over but the kiss. Don't you be
afraid of that — it ain't anything at all. Please, Becky." And he
tugged at her apron and the hands.

By and by she gave up, and let her hands drop; her face, all
glowing with the struggle, came up and submitted. Tom kissed the
red lips and said:

"Now it's all done, Becky. And always after this, you know, you
ain't ever to love anybody but me, and you ain't ever to marry
anybody but me, ever never and forever. Will you?"
