king and have only just a given name, like a nigger. But say â€”
where you going to dig first?"

"Well, I don't know. S'pose we tackle that old dead-limb tree on
the hill t'other side of Still-House branch?"

"I'm agreed."

a smoke.

"I like this," said Tom.

"So do I."

"Say, Huck, if we find a treasure here, what you going to do
with your share?"

"Well, I'll have pie and a glass of soda every day, and I'll go
to every circus that comes along. I bet I'll have a gay time."

"Well, ain't you going to save any of it?"

"Save it? What for?"
