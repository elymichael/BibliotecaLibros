"Please don't — I'd be killed, sure — but the<br/>widow's been good friends to me sometimes, and I want to tell — I<br/>will tell if you'll promise you won't ever say it was me."<br/><br/>"By George, he has got something to tell, or he wouldn't act<br/>so!" exclaimed the old man; "out with it and nobody here'll ever<br/>tell, lad."<br/><br/>Three minutes later the old man and his sons, well armed, were<br/>up the hill, and just entering the sumach path on tiptoe, their<br/>weapons in their hands.

He sprang away and sped down the<br/>hill as fast as his legs could carry him.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
