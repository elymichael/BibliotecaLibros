"I reckon I could find it — but then the bats. If they put our<br/>candles out it will be an awful fix. Let's try some other way, so<br/>as not to go through there."<br/><br/>"Well. But I hope we won't get lost. It would be so awful!" and<br/>the girl shuddered at the thought of the dreadful<br/>possibilities.<br/><br/>They started through a corridor, and traversed it in silence a<br/>long way, glancing at each new opening, to see if there was<br/>anything familiar about the look of it; but they were all strange.<br/>Every time Tom made an examination, Becky would watch his face for<br/>an encouraging sign, and he would say cheerily:<br/><br/>"Oh, it's all right. This ain't the one, but we'll come to it<br/>right away!"<br/><br/>But he felt less and less hopeful with each failure, and<br/>presently began to turn off into diverging avenues at sheer random,<br/>in desperate hope of finding the one that was wanted. He still said<br/>it was "all right," but there was such a leaden dread at his heart<br/>that the words had lost their ring and sounded just as if he had<br/>said, "All is lost!" Becky clung to his side in an anguish of fear,<br/>and tried hard to keep back the tears, but they would come. At last<br/>she said:<br/><br/>"Oh, Tom, never mind the bats, let's go back that way! We seem<br/>to get worse and worse off all the time."<br/><br/>"Listen!" said he.<br/><br/>Profound silence; silence so deep that even their breathings<br/>were conspicuous in the hush. Tom shouted. The call went echoing<br/>down the empty aisles and died out in the distance in a faint sound<br/>that resembled a ripple of mocking laughter.<br/><br/>"Oh, don't do it again, Tom, it is too horrid," said Becky.<br/><br/>"It is horrid, but I better, Becky; they might hear us, you<br/>know," and he shouted again.<br/><br/>The "might" was even a chillier horror than the ghostly<br/>laughter, it so confessed a perishing hope. The children stood<br/>still and listened; but there was no result. Tom turned upon the<br/>back track at once, and hurried his steps. It was but a little<br/>while before a certain indecision in his manner revealed another<br/>fearful fact to Becky — he could not find his way back!<br/>
