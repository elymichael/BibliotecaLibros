The boys bent their heads together and scarcely breathed. A<br/>muffled sound of voices floated up from the far end of the<br/>graveyard.<br/><br/>"Look! See there!" whispered Tom. "What is it?"<br/><br/>"It's devil-fire. Oh, Tom, this is awful."<br/><br/>Some vague figures approached through the gloom, swinging an<br/>old-fashioned tin lantern that freckled the ground with innumerable<br/>little spangles of light. Presently Huckleberry whispered with a<br/>shudder:<br/><br/>"It's the devils sure enough. Three of 'em! Lordy, Tom, we're<br/>goners! Can you pray?"<br/><br/>"I'll try, but don't you be afeard. They ain't going to hurt us.<br/>'Now I lay me down to sleep, I —'"<br/><br/>"Sh!"<br/><br/>"What is it, Huck?"<br/><br/>"They're humans! One of 'em is, anyway. One of 'em's old Muff<br/>Potter's voice."<br/><br/>"No — 'tain't so, is it?"<br/><br/>"I bet I know it. Don't you stir nor budge. He ain't sharp<br/>enough to notice us. Drunk, the same as usual, likely — blamed old<br/>rip!"<br/>
