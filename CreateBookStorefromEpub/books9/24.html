"Well, I never! There's no getting round it, you can work when<br/>you're a mind to, Tom." And then she diluted the compliment by<br/>adding, "But it's powerful seldom you're a mind to, I'm bound to<br/>say. Well, go 'long and play; but mind you get back some time in a<br/>week, or I'll tan you."<br/><br/>She was so overcome by the splendor of his achievement that she<br/>took him into the closet and selected a choice apple and delivered<br/>it to him, along with an improving lecture upon the added value and<br/>flavor a treat took to itself when it came without sin through<br/>virtuous effort. And while she closed with a happy Scriptural<br/>flourish, he "hooked" a doughnut.<br/><br/>Then he skipped out, and saw Sid just starting up the outside<br/>stairway that led to the back rooms on the second floor. Clods were<br/>handy and the air was full of them in a twinkling. They raged<br/>around Sid like a hail-storm; and before Aunt Polly could collect<br/>her surprised faculties and sally to the rescue, six or seven clods<br/>had taken personal effect, and Tom was over the fence and gone.<br/>There was a gate, but as a general thing he was too crowded for<br/>time to make use of it. His soul was at peace, now that he had<br/>settled with Sid for calling attention to his black thread and<br/>getting him into trouble.<br/><br/>Tom skirted the block, and came round into a muddy alley that<br/>led by the back of his aunt's cowstable. He presently got safely<br/>beyond the reach of capture and punishment, and hastened toward the<br/>public square of the village, where two "military" companies of<br/>boys had met for conflict, according to previous appointment. Tom<br/>was General of one of these armies, Joe Harper (a bosom friend)<br/>General of the other. These two great commanders did not condescend<br/>to fight in person — that being better suited to the still smaller<br/>fry — but sat together on an eminence and conducted the field<br/>operations by orders delivered through aides-de-camp. Tom's army<br/>won a great victory, after a long and hard-fought battle. Then the<br/>dead were counted, prisoners exchanged, the terms of the next<br/>disagreement agreed upon, and the day for the necessary battle<br/>appointed; after which the armies fell into line and marched away,<br/>and Tom turned homeward alone.<br/><br/>As he was passing by the house where Jeff Thatcher lived, he saw<br/>a new girl in the garden — a lovely little blue-eyed creature with<br/>yellow hair plaited into two long-tails, white summer frock and<br/>embroidered pantalettes. The fresh-crowned hero fell without firing<br/>a shot. A certain Amy Lawrence vanished out of his heart and left<br/>not even a memory of herself behind. He had thought he loved her to<br/>distraction; he had regarded his passion as adoration; and behold<br/>it was only a poor little evanescent partiality. He had been months<br/>winning her; she had confessed hardly a week ago; he had been the<br/>happiest and the proudest boy in the world only seven short days,<br/>and here in one instant of time she had gone out of his heart like<br/>a casual stranger whose visit is done.<br/><br/>He worshipped this new angel with furtive eye, till he saw that<br/>she had discovered him; then he pretended he did not know she was<br/>present, and began to "show off" in all sorts of absurd boyish<br/>ways, in order to win her admiration. He kept up this grotesque<br/>foolishness for some time; but by-and-by, while he was in the midst<br/>of some dangerous gymnastic performances, he glanced aside and saw<br/>that the little girl was wending her way toward the house. Tom came<br/>up to the fence and leaned on it, grieving, and hoping she would<br/>tarry yet awhile longer. She halted a moment on the steps and then<br/>moved toward the door. Tom heaved a great sigh as she put her foot<br/>on the threshold. But his face lit up, right away, for she tossed a<br/>pansy over the fence a moment before she disappeared.<br/><br/>The boy ran around and stopped within a foot or two of the<br/>flower, and then shaded his eyes with his hand and began to look<br/>down street as if he had discovered something of interest going on<br/>in that direction. Presently he picked up a straw and began trying<br/>to balance it on his nose, with his head tilted far back; and as he<br/>moved from side to side, in his efforts, he edged nearer and nearer<br/>toward the pansy; finally his bare foot rested upon it, his pliant<br/>toes closed upon it, and he hopped away with the treasure and<br/>disappeared round the corner. But only for a minute — only while he<br/>could button the flower inside his jacket, next his heart — or next<br/>his stomach, possibly, for he was not much posted in anatomy, and<br/>not hypercritical, anyway.<br/><br/>He returned, now, and hung about the fence till nightfall,<br/>"showing off," as before; but the girl never exhibited herself<br/>again, though Tom comforted himself a little with the hope that she<br/>had been near some window, meantime, and been aware of his<br/>attentions. Finally he strode home reluctantly, with his poor head<br/>full of visions.<br/><br/>All through supper his spirits were so high that his aunt<br/>wondered "what had got into the child." He took a good scolding<br/>about clodding Sid, and did not seem to mind it in the least. He<br/>tried to steal sugar under his aunt's very nose, and got his<br/>knuckles rapped for it. He said:<br/><br/>"Aunt, you don't whack Sid when he takes it."<br/><br/>"Well, Sid don't torment a body the way you do. You'd be always<br/>into that sugar if I warn't watching you."<br/>
