<br/>"Well, what's more dangerous than coming here in the daytime! —<br/>anybody would suspicion us that saw us."<br/><br/>"I know that. But there warn't any other place as handy after<br/>that fool of a job. I want to quit this shanty. I wanted to<br/>yesterday, only it warn't any use trying to stir out of here, with<br/>those infernal boys playing over there on the hill right in full<br/>view."<br/><br/>"Those infernal boys" quaked again under the inspiration of this<br/>remark, and thought how lucky it was that they had remembered it<br/>was Friday and concluded to wait a day. They wished in their hearts<br/>they had waited a year.<br/><br/>The two men got out some food and made a luncheon. After a long<br/>and thoughtful silence, Injun Joe said:<br/><br/>"Look here, lad — you go back up the river where you belong.<br/>Wait there till you hear from me. I'll take the chances on dropping<br/>into this town just once more, for a look. We'll do that<br/>'dangerous' job after I've spied around a little and think things<br/>look well for it. Then for Texas! We'll leg it together!"<br/><br/>This was satisfactory. Both men presently fell to yawning, and<br/>Injun Joe said:<br/><br/>"I'm dead for sleep! It's your turn to watch."<br/><br/>He curled down in the weeds and soon began to snore. His comrade<br/>stirred him once or twice and he became quiet. Presently the<br/>watcher began to nod; his head drooped lower and lower, both men<br/>began to snore now.<br/><br/>The boys drew a long, grateful breath. Tom whispered:<br/><br/>"Now's our chance — come!"<br/><br/>
