<br/>"By jingo! for two cents I will do it."<br/><br/>The new boy took two broad coppers out of his pocket and held<br/>them out with derision. Tom struck them to the ground. In an<br/>instant both boys were rolling and tumbling in the dirt, gripped<br/>together like cats; and for the space of a minute they tugged and<br/>tore at each other's hair and clothes, punched and scratched each<br/>other's nose, and covered themselves with dust and glory. Presently<br/>the confusion took form, and through the fog of battle Tom<br/>appeared, seated astride the new boy, and pounding him with his<br/>fists. "Holler 'nuff!" said he.<br/><br/>The boy only struggled to free himself. He was crying — mainly<br/>from rage.<br/><br/>"Holler 'nuff!" — and the pounding went on.<br/><br/>At last the stranger got out a smothered "'Nuff!" and Tom let<br/>him up and said:<br/><br/>"Now that'll learn you. Better look out who you're fooling with<br/>next time."<br/><br/>The new boy went off brushing the dust from his clothes,<br/>sobbing, snuffling, and occasionally looking back and shaking his<br/>head and threatening what he would do to Tom the "next time he<br/>caught him out." To which Tom responded with jeers, and started off<br/>in high feather, and as soon as his back was turned the new boy<br/>snatched up a stone, threw it and hit him between the shoulders and<br/>then turned tail and ran like an antelope. Tom chased the traitor<br/>home, and thus found out where he lived. He then held a position at<br/>the gate for some time, daring the enemy to come outside, but the<br/>enemy only made faces at him through the window and declined. At<br/>last the enemy's mother appeared, and called Tom a bad, vicious,<br/>vulgar child, and ordered him away. So he went away; but he said he<br/>"'lowed" to "lay" for that boy.<br/><br/>He got home pretty late that night, and when he climbed<br/>cautiously in at the window, he uncovered an ambuscade, in the<br/>person of his aunt; and when she saw the state his clothes were in<br/>her resolution to turn his Saturday holiday into captivity at hard<br/>labor became adamantine in its firmness.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
