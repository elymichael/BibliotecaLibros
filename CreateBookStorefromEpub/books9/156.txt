"Yes, they do. I've always heard that."

"Tom, I don't like to fool around much where there's dead
people. A body's bound to get into trouble with 'em, sure."

"I don't like to stir 'em up, either. S'pose this one here was
to stick his skull out and say something!"

"Don't Tom! It's awful."

"Well, it just is. Huck, I don't feel comfortable a bit."

"Say, Tom, let's give this place up, and try somewheres
else."

"All right, I reckon we better."

"What'll it be?"

Tom considered awhile; and then said:

"The ha'nted house. That's it!"

"Blame it, I don't like ha'nted houses, Tom. Why, they're a dern
sight worse'n dead people. Dead people might talk, maybe, but they
don't come sliding around in a shroud, when you ain't noticing, and
peep over your shoulder all of a sudden and grit their teeth, the
way a ghost does. I couldn't stand such a thing as that, Tom â€”
nobody could."
