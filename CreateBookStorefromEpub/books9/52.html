<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>7<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>The harder Tom tried to fasten his mind on his book, the more<br/>his ideas wandered. So at last, with a sigh and a yawn, he gave it<br/>up. It seemed to him that the noon recess would never come. The air<br/>was utterly dead. There was not a breath stirring. It was the<br/>sleepiest of sleepy days. The drowsing murmur of the five and<br/>twenty studying scholars soothed the soul like the spell that is in<br/>the murmur of bees. Away off in the flaming sunshine, Cardiff Hill<br/>lifted its soft green sides through a shimmering veil of heat,<br/>tinted with the purple of distance; a few birds floated on lazy<br/>wing high in the air; no other living thing was visible but some<br/>cows, and they were asleep. Tom's heart ached to be free, or else<br/>to have something of interest to do to pass the dreary time. His<br/>hand wandered into his pocket and his face lit up with a glow of<br/>gratitude that was prayer, though he did not know it. Then<br/>furtively the percussion-cap box came out. He released the tick and<br/>put him on the long flat desk. The creature probably glowed with a<br/>gratitude that amounted to prayer, too, at this moment, but it was<br/>premature: for when he started thankfully to travel off, Tom turned<br/>him aside with a pin and made him take a new direction.<br/><br/>Tom's bosom friend sat next him, suffering just as Tom had been,<br/>and now he was deeply and gratefully interested in this<br/>entertainment in an instant. This bosom friend was Joe Harper. The<br/>two boys were sworn friends all the week, and embattled enemies on<br/>Saturdays. Joe took a pin out of his lapel and began to assist in<br/>exercising the prisoner. The sport grew in interest momently. Soon<br/>Tom said that they were interfering with each other, and neither<br/>getting the fullest benefit of the tick. So he put Joe's slate on<br/>the desk and drew a line down the middle of it from top to<br/>bottom.<br/><br/>"Now," said he, "as long as he is on your side you can stir him<br/>up and I'll let him alone; but if you let him get away and get on<br/>my side, you're to leave him alone as long as I can keep him from<br/>crossing over."<br/><br/>"All right, go ahead; start him up."<br/><br/>The tick escaped from Tom, presently, and crossed the equator.<br/>Joe harassed him awhile, and then he got away and crossed back<br/>again. This change of base occurred often. While one boy was<br/>worrying the tick with absorbing interest, the other would look on<br/>with interest as strong, the two heads bowed together over the<br/>slate, and the two souls dead to all things else. At last luck<br/>seemed to settle and abide with Joe. The tick tried this, that, and<br/>the other course, and got as excited and as anxious as the boys<br/>themselves, but time and again just as he would have victory in his<br/>very grasp, so to speak, and Tom's fingers would be twitching to<br/>begin, Joe's pin would deftly head him off, and keep possession. At<br/>last Tom could stand it no longer. The temptation was too strong.<br/>So he reached out and lent a hand with his pin. Joe was angry in a<br/>moment. Said he:<br/><br/>"Tom, you let him alone."<br/><br/>
