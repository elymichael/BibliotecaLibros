"Rebecca Thatcher" [Tom glanced at her face — it was white with
terror] — "did you tear — no, look me in the face" [her hands rose
in appeal] — "did you tear this book?"

A thought shot like lightning through Tom's brain. He sprang to
his feet and shouted — "I done it!"

The school stared in perplexity at this incredible folly. Tom
stood a moment, to gather his dismembered faculties; and when he
stepped forward to go to his punishment the surprise, the
gratitude, the adoration that shone upon him out of poor Becky's
eyes seemed pay enough for a hundred floggings. Inspired by the
splendor of his own act, he took without an outcry the most
merciless flaying that even Mr. Dobbins had ever administered; and
also received with indifference the added cruelty of a command to
remain two hours after school should be dismissed — for he knew who
would wait for him outside till his captivity was done, and not
count the tedious time as loss, either.

Tom went to bed that night planning vengeance against Alfred
Temple; for with shame and repentance Becky had told him all, not
forgetting her own treachery; but even the longing for vengeance
had to give way, soon, to pleasanter musings, and he fell asleep at
last with Becky's latest words lingering dreamily in his ear —

"Tom, how could you be so noble!"
