As the earliest suspicion of dawn appeared on Sunday morning,
Huck came groping up the hill and rapped gently at the old
Welshman's door. The inmates were asleep, but it was a sleep that
was set on a hair-trigger, on account of the exciting episode of
the night. A call came from a window: "Who's there!"

Huck's scared voice answered in a low tone:

"Please let me in! It's only Huck Finn!"

"It's a name that can open this door night or day, lad! — and
welcome!"

These were strange words to the vagabond boy's ears, and the
pleasantest he had ever heard. He could not recollect that the
closing word had ever been applied in his case before. The door was
quickly unlocked, and he entered. Huck was given a seat and the old
man and his brace of tall sons speedily dressed themselves.

"Now, my boy, I hope you're good and hungry, because breakfast
will be ready as soon as the sun's up, and we'll have a piping hot
one, too — make yourself easy about that! I and the boys hoped
you'd turn up and stop here last night."
