<br/>"No — is that so? Oh come, now — lemme just try. Only just a<br/>little — I'd let you, if you was me, Tom."<br/><br/>"Ben, I'd like to, honest injun; but Aunt Polly — well, Jim<br/>wanted to do it, but she wouldn't let him; Sid wanted to do it, and<br/>she wouldn't let Sid. Now don't you see how I'm fixed? If you was<br/>to tackle this fence and anything was to happen to it —"<br/><br/>"Oh, shucks, I'll be just as careful. Now lemme try. Say — I'll<br/>give you the core of my apple."<br/><br/>"Well, here — No, Ben, now don't. I'm afeard —"<br/><br/>"I'll give you all of it!"<br/><br/>Tom gave up the brush with reluctance in his face, but alacrity<br/>in his heart. And while the late steamer Big Missouri worked and<br/>sweated in the sun, the retired artist sat on a barrel in the shade<br/>close by, dangled his legs, munched his apple, and planned the<br/>slaughter of more innocents. There was no lack of material; boys<br/>happened along every little while; they came to jeer, but remained<br/>to whitewash. By the time Ben was fagged out, Tom had traded the<br/>next chance to Billy Fisher for a kite, in good repair; and when he<br/>played out, Johnny Miller bought in for a dead rat and a string to<br/>swing it with — and so on, and so on, hour after hour. And when the<br/>middle of the afternoon came, from being a poor poverty-stricken<br/>boy in the morning, Tom was literally rolling in wealth. He had<br/>besides the things before mentioned, twelve marbles, part of a<br/>jews-harp, a piece of blue bottle-glass to look through, a spool<br/>cannon, a key that wouldn't unlock anything, a fragment of chalk, a<br/>glass stopper of a decanter, a tin soldier, a couple of tadpoles,<br/>six fire-crackers, a kitten with only one eye, a brass doorknob, a<br/>dog-collar — but no dog — the handle of a knife, four pieces of<br/>orange-peel, and a dilapidated old window sash.<br/><br/>He had had a nice, good, idle time all the while — plenty of<br/>company — and the fence had three coats of whitewash on it! If he<br/>hadn't run out of whitewash he would have bankrupted every boy in<br/>the village.<br/><br/>Tom said to himself that it was not such a hollow world, after<br/>all. He had discovered a great law of human action, without knowing<br/>it — namely, that in order to make a man or a boy covet a thing, it<br/>is only necessary to make the thing difficult to attain. If he had<br/>been a great and wise philosopher, like the writer of this book, he<br/>would now have comprehended that Work consists of whatever a body<br/>is obliged to do, and that Play consists of whatever a body is not<br/>obliged to do. And this would help him to understand why<br/>constructing artificial flowers or performing on a tread-mill is<br/>work, while rolling ten-pins or climbing Mont Blanc is only<br/>amusement. There are wealthy gentlemen in England who drive<br/>four-horse passenger-coaches twenty or thirty miles on a daily<br/>line, in the summer, because the privilege costs them considerable<br/>money; but if they were offered wages for the service, that would<br/>turn it into work and then they would resign.<br/><br/>The boy mused awhile over the substantial change which had taken<br/>place in his worldly circumstances, and then wended toward<br/>headquarters to report.<br/><br/><br/><br/>
