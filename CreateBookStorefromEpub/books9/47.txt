Tom enclosed the tick in the percussion-cap box that had lately
been the pinchbug's prison, and the boys separated, each feeling
wealthier than before.

When Tom reached the little isolated frame schoolhouse, he
strode in briskly, with the manner of one who had come with all
honest speed. He hung his hat on a peg and flung himself into his
seat with business-like alacrity. The master, throned on high in
his great splint-bottom arm-chair, was dozing, lulled by the drowsy
hum of study. The interruption roused him.

"Thomas Sawyer!"

Tom knew that when his name was pronounced in full, it meant

"Sir!"

"Come up here. Now, sir, why are you late again, as usual?"

Tom was about to take refuge in a lie, when he saw two long
tails of yellow hair hanging down a back that he recognized by the
electric sympathy of love; and by that form was the only vacant
place on the girls' side of the school-house. He instantly
said:

"I stopped to talk with Huckleberry Finn!"

The master's pulse stood still, and he stared helplessly. The
buzz of study ceased. The pupils wondered if this foolhardy boy had
lost his mind. The master said:

"You â€” you did what?"
