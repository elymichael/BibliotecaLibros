Tom blanched and dropped his eyes.

"It's a bad sign," said Aunt Polly, gravely. "What you got on
your mind, Tom?"

"Nothing. Nothing 't I know of." But the boy's hand shook so
that he spilled his coffee.

"And you do talk such stuff," Sid said. "Last night you said,
'It's blood, it's blood, that's what it is!' You said that over and
over. And you said, 'Don't torment me so — I'll tell!' Tell what?
What is it you'll tell?"

Everything was swimming before Tom. There is no telling what
might have happened, now, but luckily the concern passed out of
Aunt Polly's face and she came to Tom's relief without knowing it.
She said:

"Sho! It's that dreadful murder. I dream about it most every
night myself. Sometimes I dream it's me that done it."

Mary said she had been affected much the same way. Sid seemed
satisfied. Tom got out of the presence as quick as he plausibly
could, and after that he complained of toothache for a week, and
tied up his jaws every night. He never knew that Sid lay nightly
watching, and frequently slipped the bandage free and then leaned
on his elbow listening a good while at a time, and afterward
slipped the bandage back to its place again. Tom's distress of mind
wore off gradually and the toothache grew irksome and was
discarded. If Sid really managed to make anything out of Tom's
disjointed mutterings, he kept it to himself.

It seemed to Tom that his schoolmates never would get done
holding inquests on dead cats, and thus keeping his trouble present
to his mind. Sid noticed that Tom never was coroner at one of these
inquiries, though it had been his habit to take the lead in all new
enterprises; he noticed, too, that Tom never acted as a witness —
and that was strange; and Sid did not overlook the fact that Tom
even showed a marked aversion to these inquests, and always avoided
them when he could. Sid marvelled, but said nothing. However, even
inquests went out of vogue at last, and ceased to torture Tom's
conscience.

Every day or two, during this time of sorrow, Tom watched his
opportunity and went to the little grated jail-window and smuggled
such small comforts through to the "murderer" as he could get hold
of. The jail was a trifling little brick den that stood in a marsh
at the edge of the village, and no guards were afforded for it;
indeed, it was seldom occupied. These offerings greatly helped to
ease Tom's conscience.

The villagers had a strong desire to tar-and-feather Injun Joe
and ride him on a rail, for body-snatching, but so formidable was
his character that nobody could be found who was willing to take
the lead in the matter, so it was dropped. He had been careful to
begin both of his inquest-statements with the fight, without
confessing the grave-robbery that preceded it; therefore it was
deemed wisest not to try the case in the courts at present.
