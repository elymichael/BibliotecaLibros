<br/><br/><br/>Preface<br/><br/><br/>Most of the adventures recorded in this book really occurred;<br/>one or two were experiences of my own, the rest those of boys who<br/>were schoolmates of mine. Huck Finn is drawn from life; Tom Sawyer<br/>also, but not from an individual — he is a combination of the<br/>characteristics of three boys whom I knew, and therefore belongs to<br/>the composite order of architecture. The odd superstitions touched<br/>upon were all prevalent among children and slaves in the West at<br/>the period of this story — that is to say, thirty or forty years<br/>ago.<br/><br/>Although my book is intended mainly for the entertainment of<br/>boys and girls, I hope it will not be shunned by men and women on<br/>that account, for part of my plan has been to try to pleasantly<br/>remind adults of what they once were themselves, and of how they<br/>felt and thought and talked, and what queer enterprises they<br/>sometimes engaged in.<br/><br/>The Author. Hartford, 1876.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
