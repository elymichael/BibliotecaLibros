"Shake out that maintogalans'l! Sheets and braces! Now my<br/>hearties!"<br/><br/>"Aye-aye, sir!"<br/><br/>"Hellum-a-lee — hard a port! Stand by to meet her when she<br/>comes! Port, port! Now, men! With a will! Stead-y-y-y!"<br/><br/>"Steady it is, sir!"<br/><br/>The raft drew beyond the middle of the river; the boys pointed<br/>her head right, and then lay on their oars. The river was not high,<br/>so there was not more than a two or three mile current. Hardly a<br/>word was said during the next three-quarters of an hour. Now the<br/>raft was passing before the distant town. Two or three glimmering<br/>lights showed where it lay, peacefully sleeping, beyond the vague<br/>vast sweep of star-gemmed water, unconscious of the tremendous<br/>event that was happening. The Black Avenger stood still with folded<br/>arms, "looking his last" upon the scene of his former joys and his<br/>later sufferings, and wishing "she" could see him now, abroad on<br/>the wild sea, facing peril and death with dauntless heart, going to<br/>his doom with a grim smile on his lips. It was but a small strain<br/>on his imagination to remove Jackson's Island beyond eyeshot of the<br/>village, and so he "looked his last" with a broken and satisfied<br/>heart. The other pirates were looking their last, too; and they all<br/>looked so long that they came near letting the current drift them<br/>out of the range of the island. But they discovered the danger in<br/>time, and made shift to avert it. About two o'clock in the morning<br/>the raft grounded on the bar two hundred yards above the head of<br/>the island, and they waded back and forth until they had landed<br/>their freight. Part of the little raft's belongings consisted of an<br/>old sail, and this they spread over a nook in the bushes for a tent<br/>to shelter their provisions; but they themselves would sleep in the<br/>open air in good weather, as became outlaws.<br/><br/>They built a fire against the side of a great log twenty or<br/>thirty steps within the sombre depths of the forest, and then<br/>cooked some bacon in the frying-pan for supper, and used up half of<br/>the corn "pone" stock they had brought. It seemed glorious sport to<br/>be feasting in that wild, free way in the virgin forest of an<br/>unexplored and uninhabited island, far from the haunts of men, and<br/>they said they never would return to civilization. The climbing<br/>fire lit up their faces and threw its ruddy glare upon the pillared<br/>tree-trunks of their forest temple, and upon the varnished foliage<br/>and festooning vines.<br/><br/>When the last crisp slice of bacon was gone, and the last<br/>allowance of corn pone devoured, the boys stretched themselves out<br/>on the grass, filled with contentment. They could have found a<br/>cooler place, but they would not deny themselves such a romantic<br/>feature as the roasting camp-fire.<br/><br/>"Ain't it gay?" said Joe.<br/><br/>"It's nuts!" said Tom. "What would the boys say if they could<br/>see us?"<br/><br/>"Say? Well, they'd just die to be here — hey, Hucky!"<br/><br/>"I reckon so," said Huckleberry; "anyways, I'm suited. I don't<br/>want nothing better'n this. I don't ever get enough to eat,<br/>gen'ally — and here they can't come and pick at a feller and<br/>bullyrag him so."<br/>
