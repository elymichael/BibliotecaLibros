<br/>"Stopped to talk with Huckleberry Finn."<br/><br/>There was no mistaking the words.<br/><br/>"Thomas Sawyer, this is the most astounding confession I have<br/>ever listened to. No mere ferule will answer for this offence. Take<br/>off your jacket."<br/><br/>The master's arm performed until it was tired and the stock of<br/>switches notably diminished. Then the order followed:<br/><br/>"Now, sir, go and sit with the girls! And let this be a warning<br/>to you."<br/><br/>The titter that rippled around the room appeared to abash the<br/>boy, but in reality that result was caused rather more by his<br/>worshipful awe of his unknown idol and the dread pleasure that lay<br/>in his high good fortune. He sat down upon the end of the pine<br/>bench and the girl hitched herself away from him with a toss of her<br/>head. Nudges and winks and whispers traversed the room, but Tom sat<br/>still, with his arms upon the long, low desk before him, and seemed<br/>to study his book.<br/><br/>By and by attention ceased from him, and the accustomed school<br/>murmur rose upon the dull air once more. Presently the boy began to<br/>steal furtive glances at the girl. She observed it, "made a mouth"<br/>at him and gave him the back of her head for the space of a minute.<br/>When she cautiously faced around again, a peach lay before her. She<br/>thrust it away. Tom gently put it back. She thrust it away again,<br/>but with less animosity. Tom patiently returned it to its place.<br/>Then she let it remain. Tom scrawled on his slate, "Please take it<br/>— I got more." The girl glanced at the words, but made no sign. Now<br/>the boy began to draw something on the slate, hiding his work with<br/>his left hand. For a time the girl refused to notice; but her human<br/>curiosity presently began to manifest itself by hardly perceptible<br/>signs. The boy worked on, apparently unconscious. The girl made a<br/>sort of noncommittal attempt to see, but the boy did not betray<br/>that he was aware of it. At last she gave in and hesitatingly<br/>whispered:<br/><br/>"Let me see it."<br/><br/>Tom partly uncovered a dismal caricature of a house with two<br/>gable ends to it and a corkscrew of smoke issuing from the chimney.<br/>Then the girl's interest began to fasten itself upon the work and<br/>she forgot everything else. When it was finished, she gazed a<br/>moment, then whispered:<br/><br/>"It's nice — make a man."<br/><br/>
