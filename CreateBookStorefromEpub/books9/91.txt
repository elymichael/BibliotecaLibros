About midnight Tom arrived with a boiled ham and a few trifles,
and stopped in a dense undergrowth on a small bluff overlooking the
meeting-place. It was starlight, and very still. The mighty river
lay like an ocean at rest. Tom listened a moment, but no sound
disturbed the quiet. Then he gave a low, distinct whistle. It was
answered from under the bluff. Tom whistled twice more; these
signals were answered in the same way. Then a guarded voice
said:

"Who goes there?"

"Tom Sawyer, the Black Avenger of the Spanish Main. Name your
names."

"Huck Finn the Red-Handed, and Joe Harper the Terror of the
Seas." Tom had furnished these titles, from his favorite
literature.

"'Tis well. Give the countersign."

Two hoarse whispers delivered the same awful word simultaneously
to the brooding night:

"Blood!"

Then Tom tumbled his ham over the bluff and let himself down
after it, tearing both skin and clothes to some extent in the
effort. There was an easy, comfortable path along the shore under
the bluff, but it lacked the advantages of difficulty and danger so
valued by a pirate.

The Terror of the Seas had brought a side of bacon, and had
about worn himself out with getting it there. Finn the Red-Handed
had stolen a skillet and a quantity of half-cured leaf tobacco, and
had also brought a few corn-cobs to make pipes with. But none of
the pirates smoked or "chewed" but himself. The Black Avenger of
the Spanish Main said it would never do to start without some fire.
That was a wise thought; matches were hardly known there in that
day. They saw a fire smouldering upon a great raft a hundred yards
above, and they went stealthily thither and helped themselves to a
chunk. They made an imposing adventure of it, saying, "Hist!" every
now and then, and suddenly halting with finger on lip; moving with
hands on imaginary dagger-hilts; and giving orders in dismal
whispers that if "the foe" stirred, to "let him have it to the
hilt," because "dead men tell no tales." They knew well enough that
the raftsmen were all down at the village laying in stores or
having a spree, but still that was no excuse for their conducting
this thing in an unpiratical way.

They shoved off, presently, Tom in command, Huck at the after
oar and Joe at the forward. Tom stood amidships, gloomy-browed, and
with folded arms, and gave his orders in a low, stern whisper:

"Luff, and bring her to the wind!"
