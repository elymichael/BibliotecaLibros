"There — I told you so," said Tom. "Huck recollects it."

"I bleeve I could smoke this pipe all day," said Joe. "I don't
feel sick."

"Neither do I," said Tom. "I could smoke it all day. But I bet
you Jeff Thatcher couldn't."

"Jeff Thatcher! Why, he'd keel over just with two draws. Just
let him try it once. He'd see!"

"I bet he would. And Johnny Miller — I wish could see Johnny
Miller tackle it once."

"Oh, don't I!" said Joe. "Why, I bet you Johnny Miller couldn't
any more do this than nothing. Just one little snifter would fetch
him."

"'Deed it would, Joe. Say — I wish the boys could see us
now."

"So do I."

"Say — boys, don't say anything about it, and some time when
they're around, I'll come up to you and say, 'Joe, got a pipe? I
want a smoke.' And you'll say, kind of careless like, as if it
warn't anything, you'll say, 'Yes, I got my old pipe, and another
one, but my tobacker ain't very good.' And I'll say, 'Oh, that's
all right, if it's strong enough.' And then you'll out with the
pipes, and we'll light up just as ca'm, and then just see 'em
look!"

"By jings, that'll be gay, Tom! I wish it was Now!"
