"Any fool knows that. I don't reckon you was the first that<br/>found it out, Huck."<br/><br/>"Well, I never said I was, did I? And Friday ain't all, neither.<br/>I had a rotten bad dream last night — dreampt about rats."<br/><br/>"No! Sure sign of trouble. Did they fight?"<br/><br/>"No."<br/><br/>"Well, that's good, Huck. When they don't fight it's only a sign<br/>that there's trouble around, you know. All we got to do is to look<br/>mighty sharp and keep out of it. We'll drop this thing for to-day,<br/>and play. Do you know Robin Hood, Huck?"<br/><br/>"No. Who's Robin Hood?"<br/><br/>"Why, he was one of the greatest men that was ever in England —<br/>and the best. He was a robber."<br/><br/>"Cracky, I wisht I was. Who did he rob?"<br/><br/>"Only sheriffs and bishops and rich people and kings, and such<br/>like. But he never bothered the poor. He loved 'em. He always<br/>divided up with 'em perfectly square."<br/><br/>"Well, he must 'a' been a brick."<br/><br/>"I bet you he was, Huck. Oh, he was the noblest man that ever<br/>was. They ain't any such men now, I can tell you. He could lick any<br/>man in England, with one hand tied behind him; and he could take<br/>his yew bow and plug a ten-cent piece every time, a mile and a<br/>half."<br/>
