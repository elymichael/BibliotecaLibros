<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>14<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>When Tom awoke in the morning, he wondered where he was. He sat<br/>up and rubbed his eyes and looked around. Then he comprehended. It<br/>was the cool gray dawn, and there was a delicious sense of repose<br/>and peace in the deep pervading calm and silence of the woods. Not<br/>a leaf stirred; not a sound obtruded upon great Nature's<br/>meditation. Beaded dewdrops stood upon the leaves and grasses. A<br/>white layer of ashes covered the fire, and a thin blue breath of<br/>smoke rose straight into the air. Joe and Huck still slept.<br/><br/>Now, far away in the woods a bird called; another answered;<br/>presently the hammering of a woodpecker was heard. Gradually the<br/>cool dim gray of the morning whitened, and as gradually sounds<br/>multiplied and life manifested itself. The marvel of Nature shaking<br/>off sleep and going to work unfolded itself to the musing boy. A<br/>little green worm came crawling over a dewy leaf, lifting<br/>two-thirds of his body into the air from time to time and "sniffing<br/>around," then proceeding again — for he was measuring, Tom said;<br/>and when the worm approached him, of its own accord, he sat as<br/>still as a stone, with his hopes rising and falling, by turns, as<br/>the creature still came toward him or seemed inclined to go<br/>elsewhere; and when at last it considered a painful moment with its<br/>curved body in the air and then came decisively down upon Tom's leg<br/>and began a journey over him, his whole heart was glad — for that<br/>meant that he was going to have a new suit of clothes — without the<br/>shadow of a doubt a gaudy piratical uniform. Now a procession of<br/>ants appeared, from nowhere in particular, and went about their<br/>labors; one struggled manfully by with a dead spider five times as<br/>big as itself in its arms, and lugged it straight up a tree-trunk.<br/>A brown spotted lady-bug climbed the dizzy height of a grass blade,<br/>and Tom bent down close to it and said, "Lady-bug, lady-bug, fly<br/>away home, your house is on fire, your children's alone," and she<br/>took wing and went off to see about it — which did not surprise the<br/>boy, for he knew of old that this insect was credulous about<br/>conflagrations, and he had practised upon its simplicity more than<br/>once. A tumblebug came next, heaving sturdily at its ball, and Tom<br/>touched the creature, to see it shut its legs against its body and<br/>pretend to be dead. The birds were fairly rioting by this time. A<br/>catbird, the Northern mocker, lit in a tree over Tom's head, and<br/>trilled out her imitations of her neighbors in a rapture of<br/>enjoyment; then a shrill jay swept down, a flash of blue flame, and<br/>stopped on a twig almost within the boy's reach, cocked his head to<br/>one side and eyed the strangers with a consuming curiosity; a gray<br/>squirrel and a big fellow of the "fox" kind came skurrying along,<br/>sitting up at intervals to inspect and chatter at the boys, for the<br/>wild things had probably never seen a human being before and<br/>scarcely knew whether to be afraid or not. All Nature was wide<br/>awake and stirring, now; long lances of sunlight pierced down<br/>through the dense foliage far and near, and a few butterflies came<br/>fluttering upon the scene.<br/><br/>Tom stirred up the other pirates and they all clattered away<br/>with a shout, and in a minute or two were stripped and chasing<br/>after and tumbling over each other in the shallow limpid water of<br/>the white sandbar. They felt no longing for the little village<br/>sleeping in the distance beyond the majestic waste of water. A<br/>vagrant current or a slight rise in the river had carried off their<br/>raft, but this only gratified them, since its going was something<br/>like burning the bridge between them and civilization.<br/><br/>They came back to camp wonderfully refreshed, glad-hearted, and<br/>ravenous; and they soon had the camp-fire blazing up again. Huck<br/>found a spring of clear cold water close by, and the boys made cups<br/>of broad oak or hickory leaves, and felt that water, sweetened with<br/>such a wildwood charm as that, would be a good enough substitute<br/>for coffee. While Joe was slicing bacon for breakfast, Tom and Huck<br/>asked him to hold on a minute; they stepped to a promising nook in<br/>the river-bank and threw in their lines; almost immediately they<br/>had reward. Joe had not had time to get impatient before they were<br/>back again with some handsome bass, a couple of sun-perch and a<br/>small catfish — provisions enough for quite a family. They fried<br/>the fish with the bacon, and were astonished; for no fish had ever<br/>seemed so delicious before. They did not know that the quicker a<br/>fresh-water fish is on the fire after he is caught the better he<br/>is; and they reflected little upon what a sauce open-air sleeping,<br/>open-air exercise, bathing, and a large ingredient of hunger make,<br/>too.<br/><br/>They lay around in the shade, after breakfast, while Huck had a<br/>smoke, and then went off through the woods on an exploring<br/>expedition. They tramped gayly along, over decaying logs, through<br/>tangled underbrush, among solemn monarchs of the forest, hung from<br/>their crowns to the ground with a drooping regalia of grape-vines.<br/>Now and then they came upon snug nooks carpeted with grass and<br/>jeweled with flowers.<br/><br/>They found plenty of things to be delighted with, but nothing to<br/>be astonished at. They discovered that the island was about three<br/>miles long and a quarter of a mile wide, and that the shore it lay<br/>closest to was only separated from it by a narrow channel hardly<br/>two hundred yards wide. They took a swim about every hour, so it<br/>was close upon the middle of the afternoon when they got back to<br/>camp. They were too hungry to stop to fish, but they fared<br/>sumptuously upon cold ham, and then threw themselves down in the<br/>shade to talk. But the talk soon began to drag, and then died. The<br/>stillness, the solemnity that brooded in the woods, and the sense<br/>of loneliness, began to tell upon the spirits of the boys. They<br/>fell to thinking. A sort of undefined longing crept upon them. This<br/>took dim shape, presently — it was budding homesickness. Even Finn<br/>the Red-Handed was dreaming of his doorsteps and empty hogsheads.<br/>But they were all ashamed of their weakness, and none was brave<br/>enough to speak his thought.<br/><br/>
