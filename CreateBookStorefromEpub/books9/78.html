<br/>Tom choked off and whispered:<br/><br/>"Look, Hucky, look! He's got his back to us!"<br/><br/>Hucky looked, with joy in his heart.<br/><br/>"Well, he has, by jingoes! Did he before?"<br/><br/>"Yes, he did. But I, like a fool, never thought. Oh, this is<br/>bully, you know. Now who can he mean?"<br/><br/>The howling stopped. Tom pricked up his ears.<br/><br/>"Sh! What's that?" he whispered.<br/><br/>"Sounds like — like hogs grunting. No — it's somebody snoring,<br/>Tom."<br/><br/>"That is it! Where 'bouts is it, Huck?"<br/><br/>"I bleeve it's down at 'tother end. Sounds so, anyway. Pap used<br/>to sleep there, sometimes, 'long with the hogs, but laws bless you,<br/>he just lifts things when he snores. Besides, I reckon he ain't<br/>ever coming back to this town any more."<br/><br/>
