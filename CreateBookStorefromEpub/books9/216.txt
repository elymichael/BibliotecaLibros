shet me out, would you, Tom? You wouldn't do that, now, would you,
Tom?"

"Huck, I wouldn't want to, and I don't want to — but what would
people say? Why, they'd say, 'Mph! Tom Sawyer's Gang! pretty low
characters in it!' They'd mean you, Huck. You wouldn't like that,
and I wouldn't."

Huck was silent for some time, engaged in a mental struggle.
Finally he said:

"Well, I'll go back to the widder for a month and tackle it and
see if I can come to stand it, if you'll let me b'long to the gang,
Tom."

"All right, Huck, it's a whiz! Come along, old chap, and I'll
ask the widow to let up on you a little, Huck."

"Will you, Tom — now will you? That's good. If she'll let up on
some of the roughest things, I'll smoke private and cuss private,
and crowd through or bust. When you going to start the gang and
turn robbers?"

"Oh, right off. We'll get the boys together and have the
initiation to-night, maybe."

"Have the which?"

"Have the initiation."

"What's that?"
