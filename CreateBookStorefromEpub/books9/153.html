<br/>"It's all the same, I reckon; some says gal, some says girl —<br/>both's right, like enough. Anyway, what's her name, Tom?"<br/><br/>"I'll tell you some time — not now."<br/><br/>"All right — that'll do. Only if you get married I'll be more<br/>lonesomer than ever."<br/><br/>"No you won't. You'll come and live with me. Now stir out of<br/>this and we'll go to digging."<br/><br/>They worked and sweated for half an hour. No result. They toiled<br/>another half-hour. Still no result. Huck said:<br/><br/>"Do they always bury it as deep as this?"<br/><br/>"Sometimes — not always. Not generally. I reckon we haven't got<br/>the right place."<br/><br/>So they chose a new spot and began again. The labor dragged a<br/>little, but still they made progress. They pegged away in silence<br/>for some time. Finally Huck leaned on his shovel, swabbed the<br/>beaded drops from his brow with his sleeve, and said:<br/><br/>"Where you going to dig next, after we get this one?"<br/><br/>"I reckon maybe we'll tackle the old tree that's over yonder on<br/>Cardiff Hill back of the widow's."<br/><br/>
