[* If Mr. Harbison owned a slave named Bull, Tom would have
spoken of him as "Harbison's Bull," but a son or a dog of that name
was "Bull Harbison."]

"Oh, that's good — I tell you, Tom, I was most scared to death;
I'd a bet anything it was a stray dog."

The dog howled again. The boys' hearts sank once more.

"Oh, my! that ain't no Bull Harbison!" whispered Huckleberry.
"Do, Tom!"

Tom, quaking with fear, yielded, and put his eye to the crack.
His whisper was hardly audible when he said:

"Oh, Huck, it's a stray dog!"

"Quick, Tom, quick! Who does he mean?"

"Huck, he must mean us both — we're right together."

"Oh, Tom, I reckon we're goners. I reckon there ain't no mistake
'bout where I'll go to. I been so wicked."

"Dad fetch it! This comes of playing hookey and doing everything
a feller's told not to do. I might a been good, like Sid, if I'd a
tried — but no, I wouldn't, of course. But if ever I get off this
time, I lay I'll just waller in Sunday-schools!" And Tom began to
snuffle a little.

"You bad!" and Huckleberry began to snuffle too. "Consound it,
Tom Sawyer, you're just old pie, 'longside o' what I am. Oh, lordy,
lordy, lordy, I wisht I only had half your chance."
