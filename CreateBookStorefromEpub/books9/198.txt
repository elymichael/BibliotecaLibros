About a fortnight after Tom's rescue from the cave, he started
off to visit Huck, who had grown plenty strong enough, now, to hear
exciting talk, and Tom had some that would interest him, he
thought. Judge Thatcher's house was on Tom's way, and he stopped to
see Becky. The Judge and some friends set Tom to talking, and some
one asked him ironically if he wouldn't like to go to the cave
again. Tom said he thought he wouldn't mind it. The Judge said:

"Well, there are others just like you, Tom, I've not the least
doubt. But we have taken care of that. Nobody will get lost in that
cave any more."

"Why?"

"Because I had its big door sheathed with boiler iron two weeks
ago, and triple-locked â€” and I've got the keys."

Tom turned as white as a sheet.

"What's the matter, boy! Here, run, somebody! Fetch a glass of
water!"

The water was brought and thrown into Tom's face.

"Ah, now you're all right. What was the matter with you,
Tom?"

"Oh, Judge, Injun Joe's in the cave!"
