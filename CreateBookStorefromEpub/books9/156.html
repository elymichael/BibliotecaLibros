"Yes, they do. I've always heard that."<br/><br/>"Tom, I don't like to fool around much where there's dead<br/>people. A body's bound to get into trouble with 'em, sure."<br/><br/>"I don't like to stir 'em up, either. S'pose this one here was<br/>to stick his skull out and say something!"<br/><br/>"Don't Tom! It's awful."<br/><br/>"Well, it just is. Huck, I don't feel comfortable a bit."<br/><br/>"Say, Tom, let's give this place up, and try somewheres<br/>else."<br/><br/>"All right, I reckon we better."<br/><br/>"What'll it be?"<br/><br/>Tom considered awhile; and then said:<br/><br/>"The ha'nted house. That's it!"<br/><br/>"Blame it, I don't like ha'nted houses, Tom. Why, they're a dern<br/>sight worse'n dead people. Dead people might talk, maybe, but they<br/>don't come sliding around in a shroud, when you ain't noticing, and<br/>peep over your shoulder all of a sudden and grit their teeth, the<br/>way a ghost does. I couldn't stand such a thing as that, Tom â€”<br/>nobody could."<br/>
