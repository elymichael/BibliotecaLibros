"'Tain't a dream, then, 'tain't a dream! Somehow I most wish it<br/>was. Dog'd if I don't, Huck."<br/><br/>"What ain't a dream?"<br/><br/>"Oh, that thing yesterday. I been half thinking it was."<br/><br/>"Dream! If them stairs hadn't broke down you'd 'a' seen how much<br/>dream it was! I've had dreams enough all night — with that<br/>patch-eyed Spanish devil going for me all through 'em — rot<br/>him!"<br/><br/>"No, not rot him. Find him! Track the money!"<br/><br/>"Tom, we'll never find him. A feller don't have only one chance<br/>for such a pile — and that one's lost. I'd feel mighty shaky if I<br/>was to see him, anyway."<br/><br/>"Well, so'd I; but I'd like to see him, anyway — and track him<br/>out — to his Number Two."<br/><br/>"Number Two — yes, that's it. I been thinking 'bout that. But I<br/>can't make nothing out of it. What do you reckon it is?"<br/><br/>"I dono. It's too deep. Say, Huck — maybe it's the number of a<br/>house!"<br/><br/>"Goody!&#160;… No, Tom, that ain't it. If it is, it ain't in<br/>this one-horse town. They ain't no numbers here."<br/><br/>"Well, that's so. Lemme think a minute. Here — it's the number<br/>of a room — in a tavern, you know!"<br/>
