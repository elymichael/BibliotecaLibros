"Yes. Well, there is company there, I reckon. Better give it<br/>up."<br/><br/>"Give it up, and I just leaving this country forever! Give it up<br/>and maybe never have another chance. I tell you again, as I've told<br/>you before, I don't care for her swag — you may have it. But her<br/>husband was rough on me — many times he was rough on me — and<br/>mainly he was the justice of the peace that jugged me for a<br/>vagrant. And that ain't all. It ain't a millionth part of it! He<br/>had me horsewhipped! — horsewhipped in front of the jail, like a<br/>nigger! — with all the town looking on! Horsewhipped! — do you<br/>understand? He took advantage of me and died. But I'll take it out<br/>of her."<br/><br/>"Oh, don't kill her! Don't do that!"<br/><br/>"Kill? Who said anything about killing? I would kill him if he<br/>was here; but not her. When you want to get revenge on a woman you<br/>don't kill her — bosh! you go for her looks. You slit her nostrils<br/>— you notch her ears like a sow!"<br/><br/>"By God, that's —"<br/><br/>"Keep your opinion to yourself! It will be safest for you. I'll<br/>tie her to the bed. If she bleeds to death, is that my fault? I'll<br/>not cry, if she does. My friend, you'll help me in this thing — for<br/>my sake — that's why you're here — I mightn't be able alone. If you<br/>flinch, I'll kill you. Do you understand that? And if I have to<br/>kill you, I'll kill her — and then I reckon nobody'll ever know<br/>much about who done this business."<br/><br/>"Well, if it's got to be done, let's get at it. The quicker the<br/>better — I'm all in a shiver."<br/><br/>"Do it now? And company there? Look here — I'll get suspicious<br/>of you, first thing you know. No — we'll wait till the lights are<br/>out — there's no hurry."<br/><br/>Huck felt that a silence was going to ensue — a thing still more<br/>awful than any amount of murderous talk; so he held his breath and<br/>stepped gingerly back; planted his foot carefully and firmly, after<br/>balancing, one-legged, in a precarious way and almost toppling<br/>over, first on one side and then on the other. He took another step<br/>back, with the same elaboration and the same risks; then another<br/>and another, and — a twig snapped under his foot! His breath<br/>stopped and he listened. There was no sound — the stillness was<br/>perfect. His gratitude was measureless. Now he turned in his<br/>tracks, between the walls of sumach bushes — turned himself as<br/>carefully as if he were a ship — and then stepped quickly but<br/>cautiously along. When he emerged at the quarry he felt secure, and<br/>so he picked up his nimble heels and flew. Down, down he sped, till<br/>he reached the Welshman's. He banged at the door, and presently the<br/>heads of the old man and his two stalwart sons were thrust from<br/>windows.<br/><br/>"What's the row there? Who's banging? What do you want?"<br/><br/>"Let me in — quick! I'll tell everything."<br/>
