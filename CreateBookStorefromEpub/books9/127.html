<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>20<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>There was something about Aunt Polly's manner, when she kissed<br/>Tom, that swept away his low spirits and made him light-hearted and<br/>happy again. He started to school and had the luck of coming upon<br/>Becky Thatcher at the head of Meadow Lane. His mood always<br/>determined his manner. Without a moment's hesitation he ran to her<br/>and said:<br/><br/>"I acted mighty mean to-day, Becky, and I'm so sorry. I won't<br/>ever, ever do that way again, as long as ever I live — please make<br/>up, won't you?"<br/><br/>The girl stopped and looked him scornfully in the face:<br/><br/>"I'll thank you to keep yourself to yourself, Mr. Thomas Sawyer.<br/>I'll never speak to you again."<br/><br/>She tossed her head and passed on. Tom was so stunned that he<br/>had not even presence of mind enough to say "Who cares, Miss<br/>Smarty?" until the right time to say it had gone by. So he said<br/>nothing. But he was in a fine rage, nevertheless. He moped into the<br/>schoolyard wishing she were a boy, and imagining how he would<br/>trounce her if she were. He presently encountered her and delivered<br/>a stinging remark as he passed. She hurled one in return, and the<br/>angry breach was complete. It seemed to Becky, in her hot<br/>resentment, that she could hardly wait for school to "take in," she<br/>was so impatient to see Tom flogged for the injured spelling-book.<br/>If she had had any lingering notion of exposing Alfred Temple,<br/>Tom's offensive fling had driven it entirely away.<br/><br/>Poor girl, she did not know how fast she was nearing trouble<br/>herself. The master, Mr. Dobbins, had reached middle age with an<br/>unsatisfied ambition. The darling of his desires was, to be a<br/>doctor, but poverty had decreed that he should be nothing higher<br/>than a village schoolmaster. Every day he took a mysterious book<br/>out of his desk and absorbed himself in it at times when no classes<br/>were reciting. He kept that book under lock and key. There was not<br/>an urchin in school but was perishing to have a glimpse of it, but<br/>the chance never came. Every boy and girl had a theory about the<br/>nature of that book; but no two theories were alike, and there was<br/>no way of getting at the facts in the case. Now, as Becky was<br/>passing by the desk, which stood near the door, she noticed that<br/>the key was in the lock! It was a precious moment. She glanced<br/>around; found herself alone, and the next instant she had the book<br/>in her hands. The title-page — Professor Somebody's Anatomy —<br/>carried no information to her mind; so she began to turn the<br/>leaves. She came at once upon a handsomely engraved and colored<br/>frontispiece — a human figure, stark naked. At that moment a shadow<br/>fell on the page and Tom Sawyer stepped in at the door and caught a<br/>glimpse of the picture. Becky snatched at the book to close it, and<br/>had the hard luck to tear the pictured page half down the middle.<br/>She thrust the volume into the desk, turned the key, and burst out<br/>crying with shame and vexation.<br/><br/>
