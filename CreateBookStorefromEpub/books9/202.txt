"It's about five mile into there the way anybody but me would
go, Huck, but there's a mighty short cut that they don't anybody
but me know about. Huck, I'll take you right to it in a skiff. I'll
float the skiff down there, and I'll pull it back again all by
myself. You needn't ever turn your hand over."

"Less start right off, Tom."

"All right. We want some bread and meat, and our pipes, and a
little bag or two, and two or three kite-strings, and some of these
new-fangled things they call lucifer matches. I tell you, many's
the time I wished I had some when I was in there before."

A trifle after noon the boys borrowed a small skiff from a
citizen who was absent, and got under way at once. When they were
several miles below "Cave Hollow," Tom said:

"Now you see this bluff here looks all alike all the way down
from the cave hollow — no houses, no wood-yards, bushes all alike.
But do you see that white place up yonder where there's been a
landslide? Well, that's one of my marks. We'll get ashore,
now."

They landed.

"Now, Huck, where we're a-standing you could touch that hole I
got out of with a fishing-pole. See if you can find it."

Huck searched all the place about, and found nothing. Tom
proudly marched into a thick clump of sumach bushes and said:

"Here you are! Look at it, Huck; it's the snuggest hole in this
country. You just keep mum about it. All along I've been wanting to
be a robber, but I knew I'd got to have a thing like this, and
where to run across it was the bother. We've got it now, and we'll
keep it quiet, only we'll let Joe Harper and Ben Rogers in —
because of course there's got to be a Gang, or else there wouldn't
be any style about it. Tom Sawyer's Gang — it sounds splendid,
don't it, Huck?"

"Well, it just does, Tom. And who'll we rob?"

"Oh, most anybody. Waylay people — that's mostly the way."
