About a fortnight after Tom's rescue from the cave, he started<br/>off to visit Huck, who had grown plenty strong enough, now, to hear<br/>exciting talk, and Tom had some that would interest him, he<br/>thought. Judge Thatcher's house was on Tom's way, and he stopped to<br/>see Becky. The Judge and some friends set Tom to talking, and some<br/>one asked him ironically if he wouldn't like to go to the cave<br/>again. Tom said he thought he wouldn't mind it. The Judge said:<br/><br/>"Well, there are others just like you, Tom, I've not the least<br/>doubt. But we have taken care of that. Nobody will get lost in that<br/>cave any more."<br/><br/>"Why?"<br/><br/>"Because I had its big door sheathed with boiler iron two weeks<br/>ago, and triple-locked â€” and I've got the keys."<br/><br/>Tom turned as white as a sheet.<br/><br/>"What's the matter, boy! Here, run, somebody! Fetch a glass of<br/>water!"<br/><br/>The water was brought and thrown into Tom's face.<br/><br/>"Ah, now you're all right. What was the matter with you,<br/>Tom?"<br/><br/>"Oh, Judge, Injun Joe's in the cave!"<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
