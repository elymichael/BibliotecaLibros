"Oh, no, now. Please, Becky — I'll whisper it, I'll whisper it<br/>ever so easy."<br/><br/>Becky hesitating, Tom took silence for consent, and passed his<br/>arm about her waist and whispered the tale ever so softly, with his<br/>mouth close to her ear. And then he added:<br/><br/>"Now you whisper it to me — just the same."<br/><br/>She resisted, for a while, and then said:<br/><br/>"You turn your face away so you can't see, and then I will. But<br/>you mustn't ever tell anybody — Will you, Tom? Now you won't, will<br/>you?"<br/><br/>"No, indeed, indeed I won't. Now, Becky."<br/><br/>He turned his face away. She bent timidly around till her breath<br/>stirred his curls and whispered, "I — love — you!"<br/><br/>Then she sprang away and ran around and around the desks and<br/>benches, with Tom after her, and took refuge in a corner at last,<br/>with her little white apron to her face. Tom clasped her about her<br/>neck and pleaded:<br/><br/>"Now, Becky, it's all done — all over but the kiss. Don't you be<br/>afraid of that — it ain't anything at all. Please, Becky." And he<br/>tugged at her apron and the hands.<br/><br/>By and by she gave up, and let her hands drop; her face, all<br/>glowing with the struggle, came up and submitted. Tom kissed the<br/>red lips and said:<br/><br/>"Now it's all done, Becky. And always after this, you know, you<br/>ain't ever to love anybody but me, and you ain't ever to marry<br/>anybody but me, ever never and forever. Will you?"<br/>
