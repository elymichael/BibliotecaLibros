"I reckon I could find it — but then the bats. If they put our
candles out it will be an awful fix. Let's try some other way, so
as not to go through there."

"Well. But I hope we won't get lost. It would be so awful!" and
the girl shuddered at the thought of the dreadful
possibilities.

They started through a corridor, and traversed it in silence a
long way, glancing at each new opening, to see if there was
anything familiar about the look of it; but they were all strange.
Every time Tom made an examination, Becky would watch his face for
an encouraging sign, and he would say cheerily:

"Oh, it's all right. This ain't the one, but we'll come to it
right away!"

But he felt less and less hopeful with each failure, and
presently began to turn off into diverging avenues at sheer random,
in desperate hope of finding the one that was wanted. He still said
it was "all right," but there was such a leaden dread at his heart
that the words had lost their ring and sounded just as if he had
said, "All is lost!" Becky clung to his side in an anguish of fear,
and tried hard to keep back the tears, but they would come. At last
she said:

"Oh, Tom, never mind the bats, let's go back that way! We seem
to get worse and worse off all the time."

"Listen!" said he.

Profound silence; silence so deep that even their breathings
were conspicuous in the hush. Tom shouted. The call went echoing
down the empty aisles and died out in the distance in a faint sound
that resembled a ripple of mocking laughter.

"Oh, don't do it again, Tom, it is too horrid," said Becky.

"It is horrid, but I better, Becky; they might hear us, you
know," and he shouted again.

The "might" was even a chillier horror than the ghostly
laughter, it so confessed a perishing hope. The children stood
still and listened; but there was no result. Tom turned upon the
back track at once, and hurried his steps. It was but a little
while before a certain indecision in his manner revealed another
fearful fact to Becky — he could not find his way back!
