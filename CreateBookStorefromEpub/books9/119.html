"And then there was a whole lot of talk 'bout dragging the river<br/>for us, and 'bout having the funeral Sunday, and then you and old<br/>Miss Harper hugged and cried, and she went."<br/><br/>"It happened just so! It happened just so, as sure as I'm<br/>a-sitting in these very tracks. Tom, you couldn't told it more like<br/>if you'd 'a' seen it! And then what? Go on, Tom!"<br/><br/>"Then I thought you prayed for me — and I could see you and hear<br/>every word you said. And you went to bed, and I was so sorry that I<br/>took and wrote on a piece of sycamore bark, 'We ain't dead — we are<br/>only off being pirates,' and put it on the table by the candle; and<br/>then you looked so good, laying there asleep, that I thought I went<br/>and leaned over and kissed you on the lips."<br/><br/>"Did you, Tom, did you! I just forgive you everything for that!"<br/>And she seized the boy in a crushing embrace that made him feel<br/>like the guiltiest of villains.<br/><br/>"It was very kind, even though it was only a — dream," Sid<br/>soliloquized just audibly.<br/><br/>"Shut up, Sid! A body does just the same in a dream as he'd do<br/>if he was awake. Here's a big Milum apple I've been saving for you,<br/>Tom, if you was ever found again — now go 'long to school. I'm<br/>thankful to the good God and Father of us all I've got you back,<br/>that's long-suffering and merciful to them that believe on Him and<br/>keep His word, though goodness knows I'm unworthy of it, but if<br/>only the worthy ones got His blessings and had His hand to help<br/>them over the rough places, there's few enough would smile here or<br/>ever enter into His rest when the long night comes. Go 'long Sid,<br/>Mary, Tom — take yourselves off — you've hendered me long<br/>enough."<br/><br/>The children left for school, and the old lady to call on Mrs.<br/>Harper and vanquish her realism with Tom's marvellous dream. Sid<br/>had better judgment than to utter the thought that was in his mind<br/>as he left the house. It was this: "Pretty thin — as long a dream<br/>as that, without any mistakes in it!"<br/><br/>What a hero Tom was become, now! He did not go skipping and<br/>prancing, but moved with a dignified swagger as became a pirate who<br/>felt that the public eye was on him. And indeed it was; he tried<br/>not to seem to see the looks or hear the remarks as he passed<br/>along, but they were food and drink to him. Smaller boys than<br/>himself flocked at his heels, as proud to be seen with him, and<br/>tolerated by him, as if he had been the drummer at the head of a<br/>procession or the elephant leading a menagerie into town. Boys of<br/>his own size pretended not to know he had been away at all; but<br/>they were consuming with envy, nevertheless. They would have given<br/>anything to have that swarthy suntanned skin of his, and his<br/>glittering notoriety; and Tom would not have parted with either for<br/>a circus.<br/><br/>At school the children made so much of him and of Joe, and<br/>delivered such eloquent admiration from their eyes, that the two<br/>heroes were not long in becoming insufferably "stuck-up." They<br/>began to tell their adventures to hungry listeners — but they only<br/>began; it was not a thing likely to have an end, with imaginations<br/>like theirs to furnish material. And finally, when they got out<br/>their pipes and went serenely puffing around, the very summit of<br/>glory was reached.<br/><br/>Tom decided that he could be independent of Becky Thatcher now.<br/>Glory was sufficient. He would live for glory. Now that he was<br/>distinguished, maybe she would be wanting to "make up." Well, let<br/>her — she should see that he could be as indifferent as some other<br/>people. Presently she arrived. Tom pretended not to see her. He<br/>moved away and joined a group of boys and girls and began to talk.<br/>Soon he observed that she was tripping gayly back and forth with<br/>flushed face and dancing eyes, pretending to be busy chasing<br/>schoolmates, and screaming with laughter when she made a capture;<br/>but he noticed that she always made her captures in his vicinity,<br/>and that she seemed to cast a conscious eye in his direction at<br/>such times, too. It gratified all the vicious vanity that was in<br/>him; and so, instead of winning him, it only "set him up" the more<br/>and made him the more diligent to avoid betraying that he knew she<br/>was about. Presently she gave over skylarking, and moved<br/>irresolutely about, sighing once or twice and glancing furtively<br/>and wistfully toward Tom. Then she observed that now Tom was<br/>talking more particularly to Amy Lawrence than to any one else. She<br/>felt a sharp pang and grew disturbed and uneasy at once. She tried<br/>to go away, but her feet were treacherous, and carried her to the<br/>group instead. She said to a girl almost at Tom's elbow — with sham<br/>vivacity:<br/><br/>"Why, Mary Austin! you bad girl, why didn't you come to<br/>Sunday-school?"<br/>
