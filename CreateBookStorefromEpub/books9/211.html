"It's one of the widow's parties that she's always having. This<br/>time it's for the Welshman and his sons, on account of that scrape<br/>they helped her out of the other night. And say — I can tell you<br/>something, if you want to know."<br/><br/>"Well, what?"<br/><br/>"Why, old Mr. Jones is going to try to spring something on the<br/>people here to-night, but I overheard him tell auntie to-day about<br/>it, as a secret, but I reckon it's not much of a secret now.<br/>Everybody knows — the widow, too, for all she tries to let on she<br/>don't. Mr. Jones was bound Huck should be here — couldn't get along<br/>with his grand secret without Huck, you know!"<br/><br/>"Secret about what, Sid?"<br/><br/>"About Huck tracking the robbers to the widow's. I reckon Mr.<br/>Jones was going to make a grand time over his surprise, but I bet<br/>you it will drop pretty flat."<br/><br/>Sid chuckled in a very contented and satisfied way.<br/><br/>"Sid, was it you that told?"<br/><br/>"Oh, never mind who it was. somebody told — that's enough."<br/><br/>"Sid, there's only one person in this town mean enough to do<br/>that, and that's you. If you had been in Huck's place you'd 'a'<br/>sneaked down the hill and never told anybody on the robbers. You<br/>can't do any but mean things, and you can't bear to see anybody<br/>praised for doing good ones. There — no thanks, as the widow says"<br/>— and Tom cuffed Sid's ears and helped him to the door with several<br/>kicks. "Now go and tell auntie if you dare — and to-morrow you'll<br/>catch it!"<br/><br/>Some minutes later the widow's guests were at the supper-table,<br/>and a dozen children were propped up at little side-tables in the<br/>same room, after the fashion of that country and that day. At the<br/>proper time Mr. Jones made his little speech, in which he thanked<br/>the widow for the honor she was doing himself and his sons, but<br/>said that there was another person whose modesty —<br/><br/>And so forth and so on. He sprung his secret about Huck's share<br/>in the adventure in the finest dramatic manner he was master of,<br/>but the surprise it occasioned was largely counterfeit and not as<br/>clamorous and effusive as it might have been under happier<br/>circumstances. However, the widow made a pretty fair show of<br/>astonishment, and heaped so many compliments and so much gratitude<br/>upon Huck that he almost forgot the nearly intolerable discomfort<br/>of his new clothes in the entirely intolerable discomfort of being<br/>set up as a target for everybody's gaze and everybody's<br/>laudations.<br/>
