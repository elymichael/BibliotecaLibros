He sat down and took a long rest, torturing himself meanwhile to
keep awake, and then started warily down the home-stretch. The
night was far spent. It was broad daylight before he found himself
fairly abreast the island bar. He rested again until the sun was
well up and gilding the great river with its splendor, and then he
plunged into the stream. A little later he paused, dripping, upon
the threshold of the camp, and heard Joe say:

"No, Tom's true-blue, Huck, and he'll come back. He won't
desert. He knows that would be a disgrace to a pirate, and Tom's
too proud for that sort of thing. He's up to something or other.
Now I wonder what?"

"Well, the things is ours, anyway, ain't they?"

Pretty near, but not yet, Huck. The writing says they are if he
ain't back here to breakfast."

"Which he is!" exclaimed Tom, with fine dramatic effect,
stepping grandly into camp.

A sumptuous breakfast of bacon and fish was shortly provided,
and as the boys set to work upon it, Tom recounted (and adorned)
his adventures. They were a vain and boastful company of heroes
when the tale was done. Then Tom hid himself away in a shady nook
to sleep till noon, and the other pirates got ready to fish and
explore.
