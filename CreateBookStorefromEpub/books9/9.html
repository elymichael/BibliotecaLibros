"Powerful warm, warn't it?"<br/><br/>"Yes'm."<br/><br/>"Didn't you want to go in a-swimming, Tom?"<br/><br/>A bit of a scare shot through Tom — a touch of uncomfortable<br/>suspicion. He searched Aunt Polly's face, but it told him nothing.<br/>So he said:<br/><br/>"No'm — well, not very much."<br/><br/>The old lady reached out her hand and felt Tom's shirt, and<br/>said:<br/><br/>"But you ain't too warm now, though." And it flattered her to<br/>reflect that she had discovered that the shirt was dry without<br/>anybody knowing that that was what she had in her mind. But in<br/>spite of her, Tom knew where the wind lay, now. So he forestalled<br/>what might be the next move:<br/><br/>"Some of us pumped on our heads — mine's damp yet. See?"<br/><br/>Aunt Polly was vexed to think she had overlooked that bit of<br/>circumstantial evidence, and missed a trick. Then she had a new<br/>inspiration:<br/><br/>"Tom, you didn't have to undo your shirt collar where I sewed<br/>it, to pump on your head, did you? Unbutton your jacket!"<br/><br/>The trouble vanished out of Tom's face. He opened his jacket.<br/>His shirt collar was securely sewed.<br/>
