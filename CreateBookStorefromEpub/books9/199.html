<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>33<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>Within a few minutes the news had spread, and a dozen<br/>skiff-loads of men were on their way to McDougal's cave, and the<br/>ferryboat, well filled with passengers, soon followed. Tom Sawyer<br/>was in the skiff that bore Judge Thatcher. When the cave door was<br/>unlocked, a sorrowful sight presented itself in the dim twilight of<br/>the place. Injun Joe lay stretched upon the ground, dead, with his<br/>face close to the crack of the door, as if his longing eyes had<br/>been fixed, to the latest moment, upon the light and the cheer of<br/>the free world outside. Tom was touched, for he knew by his own<br/>experience how this wretch had suffered. His pity was moved, but<br/>nevertheless he felt an abounding sense of relief and security,<br/>now, which revealed to him in a degree which he had not fully<br/>appreciated before how vast a weight of dread had been lying upon<br/>him since the day he lifted his voice against this bloody-minded<br/>outcast.<br/><br/>Injun Joe's bowie-knife lay close by, its blade broken in two.<br/>The great foundation-beam of the door had been chipped and hacked<br/>through, with tedious labor; useless labor, too, it was, for the<br/>native rock formed a sill outside it, and upon that stubborn<br/>material the knife had wrought no effect; the only damage done was<br/>to the knife itself. But if there had been no stony obstruction<br/>there the labor would have been useless still, for if the beam had<br/>been wholly cut away Injun Joe could not have squeezed his body<br/>under the door, and he knew it. So he had only hacked that place in<br/>order to be doing something — in order to pass the weary time — in<br/>order to employ his tortured faculties. Ordinarily one could find<br/>half a dozen bits of candle stuck around in the crevices of this<br/>vestibule, left there by tourists; but there were none now. The<br/>prisoner had searched them out and eaten them. He had also<br/>contrived to catch a few bats, and these, also, he had eaten,<br/>leaving only their claws. The poor unfortunate had starved to<br/>death. In one place, near at hand, a stalagmite had been slowly<br/>growing up from the ground for ages, builded by the water-drip from<br/>a stalactite overhead. The captive had broken off the stalagmite,<br/>and upon the stump had placed a stone, wherein he had scooped a<br/>shallow hollow to catch the precious drop that fell once in every<br/>three minutes with the dreary regularity of a clock-tick — a<br/>dessertspoonful once in four and twenty hours. That drop was<br/>falling when the Pyramids were new; when Troy fell; when the<br/>foundations of Rome were laid when Christ was crucified; when the<br/>Conqueror created the British empire; when Columbus sailed; when<br/>the massacre at Lexington was "news." It is falling now; it will<br/>still be falling when all these things shall have sunk down the<br/>afternoon of history, and the twilight of tradition, and been<br/>swallowed up in the thick night of oblivion. Has everything a<br/>purpose and a mission? Did this drop fall patiently during five<br/>thousand years to be ready for this flitting human insect's need?<br/>and has it another important object to accomplish ten thousand<br/>years to come? No matter. It is many and many a year since the<br/>hapless half-breed scooped out the stone to catch the priceless<br/>drops, but to this day the tourist stares longest at that pathetic<br/>stone and that slow-dropping water when he comes to see the wonders<br/>of McDougal's cave. Injun Joe's cup stands first in the list of the<br/>cavern's marvels; even "Aladdin's Palace" cannot rival it.<br/><br/>Injun Joe was buried near the mouth of the cave; and people<br/>flocked there in boats and wagons from the towns and from all the<br/>farms and hamlets for seven miles around; they brought their<br/>children, and all sorts of provisions, and confessed that they had<br/>had almost as satisfactory a time at the funeral as they could have<br/>had at the hanging.<br/><br/>This funeral stopped the further growth of one thing — the<br/>petition to the governor for Injun Joe's pardon. The petition had<br/>been largely signed; many tearful and eloquent meetings had been<br/>held, and a committee of sappy women been appointed to go in deep<br/>mourning and wail around the governor, and implore him to be a<br/>merciful ass and trample his duty under foot. Injun Joe was<br/>believed to have killed five citizens of the village, but what of<br/>that? If he had been Satan himself there would have been plenty of<br/>weaklings ready to scribble their names to a pardon-petition, and<br/>drip a tear on it from their permanently impaired and leaky<br/>water-works.<br/><br/>The morning after the funeral Tom took Huck to a private place<br/>to have an important talk. Huck had learned all about Tom's<br/>adventure from the Welshman and the Widow Douglas, by this time,<br/>but Tom said he reckoned there was one thing they had not told him;<br/>that thing was what he wanted to talk about now. Huck's face<br/>saddened. He said:<br/><br/>"I know what it is. You got into No. 2 and never found anything<br/>but whiskey. Nobody told me it was you; but I just knowed it must<br/>'a' ben you, soon as I heard 'bout that whiskey business; and I<br/>knowed you hadn't got the money becuz you'd 'a' got at me some way<br/>or other and told me even if you was mum to everybody else. Tom,<br/>something's always told me we'd never get holt of that swag."<br/><br/>
