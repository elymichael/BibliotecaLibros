"Wait! Wait! I want to tell you something!"<br/><br/>They presently stopped and turned around. When he got to where<br/>they were, he began unfolding his secret, and they listened moodily<br/>till at last they saw the "point" he was driving at, and then they<br/>set up a war-whoop of applause and said it was "splendid!" and said<br/>if he had told them at first, they wouldn't have started away. He<br/>made a plausible excuse; but his real reason had been the fear that<br/>not even the secret would keep them with him any very great length<br/>of time, and so he had meant to hold it in reserve as a last<br/>seduction.<br/><br/>The lads came gayly back and went at their sports again with a<br/>will, chattering all the time about Tom's stupendous plan and<br/>admiring the genius of it. After a dainty egg and fish dinner, Tom<br/>said he wanted to learn to smoke, now. Joe caught at the idea and<br/>said he would like to try, too. So Huck made pipes and filled them.<br/>These novices had never smoked anything before but cigars made of<br/>grape-vine, and they "bit" the tongue, and were not considered<br/>manly anyway.<br/><br/>Now they stretched themselves out on their elbows and began to<br/>puff, charily, and with slender confidence. The smoke had an<br/>unpleasant taste, and they gagged a little, but Tom said:<br/><br/>"Why, it's just as easy! If I'd a knowed this was all, I'd a<br/>learnt long ago."<br/><br/>"So would I," said Joe. "It's just nothing."<br/><br/>"Why, many a time I've looked at people smoking, and thought<br/>well I wish I could do that; but I never thought I could," said<br/>Tom.<br/><br/>"That's just the way with me, hain't it, Huck? You've heard me<br/>talk just that way — haven't you, Huck? I'll leave it to Huck if I<br/>haven't."<br/><br/>"Yes — heaps of times," said Huck.<br/><br/>"Well, I have too," said Tom; "oh, hundreds of times. Once down<br/>by the slaughter-house. Don't you remember, Huck? Bob Tanner was<br/>there, and Johnny Miller, and Jeff Thatcher, when I said it. Don't<br/>you remember, Huck, 'bout me saying that?"<br/><br/>"Yes, that's so," said Huck. "That was the day after I lost a<br/>white alley. No, 'twas the day before."<br/>
