Tom's mind was made up now. He was gloomy and desperate. He was
a forsaken, friendless boy, he said; nobody loved him; when they
found out what they had driven him to, perhaps they would be sorry;
he had tried to do right and get along, but they would not let him;
since nothing would do them but to be rid of him, let it be so; and
let them blame him for the consequences — why shouldn't they? What
right had the friendless to complain? Yes, they had forced him to
it at last: he would lead a life of crime. There was no choice.

By this time he was far down Meadow Lane, and the bell for
school to "take up" tinkled faintly upon his ear. He sobbed, now,
to think he should never, never hear that old familiar sound any
more — it was very hard, but it was forced on him; since he was
driven out into the cold world, he must submit — but he forgave
them. Then the sobs came thick and fast.

Just at this point he met his soul's sworn comrade, Joe Harper —
hard-eyed, and with evidently a great and dismal purpose in his
heart. Plainly here were "two souls with but a single thought."
Tom, wiping his eyes with his sleeve, began to blubber out
something about a resolution to escape from hard usage and lack of
sympathy at home by roaming abroad into the great world never to
return; and ended by hoping that Joe would not forget him.

But it transpired that this was a request which Joe had just
been going to make of Tom, and had come to hunt him up for that
purpose. His mother had whipped him for drinking some cream which
he had never tasted and knew nothing about; it was plain that she
was tired of him and wished him to go; if she felt that way, there
was nothing for him to do but succumb; he hoped she would be happy,
and never regret having driven her poor boy out into the unfeeling
world to suffer and die.

As the two boys walked sorrowing along, they made a new compact
to stand by each other and be brothers and never separate till
death relieved them of their troubles. Then they began to lay their
plans. Joe was for being a hermit, and living on crusts in a remote
cave, and dying, some time, of cold and want and grief; but after
listening to Tom, he conceded that there were some conspicuous
advantages about a life of crime, and so he consented to be a
pirate.

Three miles below St. Petersburg, at a point where the
Mississippi River was a trifle over a mile wide, there was a long,
narrow, wooded island, with a shallow bar at the head of it, and
this offered well as a rendezvous. It was not inhabited; it lay far
over toward the further shore, abreast a dense and almost wholly
unpeopled forest. So Jackson's Island was chosen. Who were to be
the subjects of their piracies was a matter that did not occur to
them. Then they hunted up Huckleberry Finn, and he joined them
promptly, for all careers were one to him; he was indifferent. They
presently separated to meet at a lonely spot on the river-bank two
miles above the village at the favorite hour — which was midnight.
There was a small log raft there which they meant to capture. Each
would bring hooks and lines, and such provision as he could steal
in the most dark and mysterious way — as became outlaws. And before
the afternoon was done, they had all managed to enjoy the sweet
glory of spreading the fact that pretty soon the town would "hear
something." All who got this vague hint were cautioned to "be mum
and wait."
