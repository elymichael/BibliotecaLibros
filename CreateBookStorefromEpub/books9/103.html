<br/>He sat down and took a long rest, torturing himself meanwhile to<br/>keep awake, and then started warily down the home-stretch. The<br/>night was far spent. It was broad daylight before he found himself<br/>fairly abreast the island bar. He rested again until the sun was<br/>well up and gilding the great river with its splendor, and then he<br/>plunged into the stream. A little later he paused, dripping, upon<br/>the threshold of the camp, and heard Joe say:<br/><br/>"No, Tom's true-blue, Huck, and he'll come back. He won't<br/>desert. He knows that would be a disgrace to a pirate, and Tom's<br/>too proud for that sort of thing. He's up to something or other.<br/>Now I wonder what?"<br/><br/>"Well, the things is ours, anyway, ain't they?"<br/><br/>Pretty near, but not yet, Huck. The writing says they are if he<br/>ain't back here to breakfast."<br/><br/>"Which he is!" exclaimed Tom, with fine dramatic effect,<br/>stepping grandly into camp.<br/><br/>A sumptuous breakfast of bacon and fish was shortly provided,<br/>and as the boys set to work upon it, Tom recounted (and adorned)<br/>his adventures. They were a vain and boastful company of heroes<br/>when the tale was done. Then Tom hid himself away in a shady nook<br/>to sleep till noon, and the other pirates got ready to fish and<br/>explore.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
