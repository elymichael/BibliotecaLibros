Potter trembled and grew white.

"I thought I'd got sober. I'd no business to drink to-night. But
it's in my head yet — worse'n when we started here. I'm all in a
muddle; can't recollect anything of it, hardly. Tell me, Joe —
honest, now, old feller — did I do it? Joe, I never meant to — 'pon
my soul and honor, I never meant to, Joe. Tell me how it was, Joe.
Oh, it's awful — and him so young and promising."

"Why, you two was scuffling, and he fetched you one with the
headboard and you fell flat; and then up you come, all reeling and
staggering like, and snatched the knife and jammed it into him,
just as he fetched you another awful clip — and here you've laid,
as dead as a wedge til now."

"Oh, I didn't know what I was a-doing. I wish I may die this
minute if I did. It was all on account of the whiskey and the
excitement, I reckon. I never used a weepon in my life before, Joe.
I've fought, but never with weepons. They'll all say that. Joe,
don't tell! Say you won't tell, Joe — that's a good feller. I
always liked you, Joe, and stood up for you, too. Don't you
remember? You won't tell, will you, Joe?" And the poor creature
dropped on his knees before the stolid murderer, and clasped his
appealing hands.

"No, you've always been fair and square with me, Muff Potter,
and I won't go back on you. There, now, that's as fair as a man can
say."

"Oh, Joe, you're an angel. I'll bless you for this the longest
day I live." And Potter began to cry.

"Come, now, that's enough of that. This ain't any time for
blubbering. You be off yonder way and I'll go this. Move, now, and
don't leave any tracks behind you."

Potter started on a trot that quickly increased to a run. The
half-breed stood looking after him. He muttered:

"If he's as much stunned with the lick and fuddled with the rum
as he had the look of being, he won't think of the knife till he's
gone so far he'll be afraid to come back after it to such a place
by himself — chicken-heart!"

Two or three minutes later the murdered man, the blanketed
corpse, the lidless coffin, and the open grave were under no
inspection but the moon's. The stillness was complete again,
too.
