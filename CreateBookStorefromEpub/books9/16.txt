"By jingo! for two cents I will do it."

The new boy took two broad coppers out of his pocket and held
them out with derision. Tom struck them to the ground. In an
instant both boys were rolling and tumbling in the dirt, gripped
together like cats; and for the space of a minute they tugged and
tore at each other's hair and clothes, punched and scratched each
other's nose, and covered themselves with dust and glory. Presently
the confusion took form, and through the fog of battle Tom
appeared, seated astride the new boy, and pounding him with his
fists. "Holler 'nuff!" said he.

The boy only struggled to free himself. He was crying — mainly
from rage.

"Holler 'nuff!" — and the pounding went on.

At last the stranger got out a smothered "'Nuff!" and Tom let
him up and said:

"Now that'll learn you. Better look out who you're fooling with
next time."

The new boy went off brushing the dust from his clothes,
sobbing, snuffling, and occasionally looking back and shaking his
head and threatening what he would do to Tom the "next time he
caught him out." To which Tom responded with jeers, and started off
in high feather, and as soon as his back was turned the new boy
snatched up a stone, threw it and hit him between the shoulders and
then turned tail and ran like an antelope. Tom chased the traitor
home, and thus found out where he lived. He then held a position at
the gate for some time, daring the enemy to come outside, but the
enemy only made faces at him through the window and declined. At
last the enemy's mother appeared, and called Tom a bad, vicious,
vulgar child, and ordered him away. So he went away; but he said he
"'lowed" to "lay" for that boy.

He got home pretty late that night, and when he climbed
cautiously in at the window, he uncovered an ambuscade, in the
person of his aunt; and when she saw the state his clothes were in
her resolution to turn his Saturday holiday into captivity at hard
labor became adamantine in its firmness.
