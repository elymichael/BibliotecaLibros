"Yes!&#160;… Oh, my! Let's run!"

"Keep still! Don't you budge! They're coming right toward the
door."

The boys stretched themselves upon the floor with their eyes to
knot-holes in the planking, and lay waiting, in a misery of
fear.

"They've stopped… . No — coming… . Here they are. Don't whisper
another word, Huck. My goodness, I wish I was out of this!"

Two men entered. Each boy said to himself: "There's the old deaf
and dumb Spaniard that's been about town once or twice lately —
never saw t'other man before."

"T'other" was a ragged, unkempt creature, with nothing very
pleasant in his face. The Spaniard was wrapped in a serape; he had
bushy white whiskers; long white hair flowed from under his
sombrero, and he wore green goggles. When they came in, "t'other"
was talking in a low voice; they sat down on the ground, facing the
door, with their backs to the wall, and the speaker continued his
remarks. His manner became less guarded and his words more distinct
as he proceeded:

"No," said he, "I've thought it all over, and I don't like it.
It's dangerous."

"Dangerous!" grunted the "deaf and dumb" Spaniard — to the vast
surprise of the boys. "Milksop!"

This voice made the boys gasp and quake. It was Injun Joe's!
There was silence for some time. Then Joe said:

"What's any more dangerous than that job up yonder — but
nothing's come of it."

"That's different. Away up the river so, and not another house
about. 'Twon't ever be known that we tried, anyway, long as we
didn't succeed."
