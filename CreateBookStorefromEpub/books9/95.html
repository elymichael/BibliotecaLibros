"Run away! Well, you would be a nice old slouch of a hermit.<br/>You'd be a disgrace."<br/><br/>The Red-Handed made no response, being better employed. He had<br/>finished gouging out a cob, and now he fitted a weed stem to it,<br/>loaded it with tobacco, and was pressing a coal to the charge and<br/>blowing a cloud of fragrant smoke — he was in the full bloom of<br/>luxurious contentment. The other pirates envied him this majestic<br/>vice, and secretly resolved to acquire it shortly. Presently Huck<br/>said:<br/><br/>"What does pirates have to do?"<br/><br/>Tom said:<br/><br/>"Oh, they have just a bully time — take ships and burn them, and<br/>get the money and bury it in awful places in their island where<br/>there's ghosts and things to watch it, and kill everybody in the<br/>ships — make 'em walk a plank."<br/><br/>"And they carry the women to the island," said Joe; "they don't<br/>kill the women."<br/><br/>"No," assented Tom, "they don't kill the women — they're too<br/>noble. And the women's always beautiful, too.<br/><br/>"And don't they wear the bulliest clothes! Oh no! All gold and<br/>silver and di'monds," said Joe, with enthusiasm.<br/><br/>"Who?" said Huck.<br/><br/>"Why, the pirates."<br/><br/>Huck scanned his own clothing forlornly.<br/>
