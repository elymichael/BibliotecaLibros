"But they buried him Saturday. Didn't they get him Saturday
night?"

"Why, how you talk! How could their charms work till midnight? —
and then it's Sunday. Devils don't slosh around much of a Sunday, I
don't reckon."

"I never thought of that. That's so. Lemme go with you?"

"Of course — if you ain't afeard."

"Afeard! 'Tain't likely. Will you meow?"

"Yes — and you meow back, if you get a chance. Last time, you
kep' me a-meowing around till old Hays went to throwing rocks at me
and says 'Dern that cat!' and so I hove a brick through his window
— but don't you tell."

"I won't. I couldn't meow that night, becuz auntie was watching
me, but I'll meow this time. Say — what's that?"

"Nothing but a tick."

"Where'd you get him?"

"Out in the woods."

"What'll you take for him?"
