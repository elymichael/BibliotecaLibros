"So would I. But robbers don't do that way. They always hide it
and leave it there."

"Don't they come after it any more?"

"No, they think they will, but they generally forget the marks,
or else they die. Anyway, it lays there a long time and gets rusty;
and by and by somebody finds an old yellow paper that tells how to
find the marks — a paper that's got to be ciphered over about a
week because it's mostly signs and hy'roglyphics."

"HyroQwhich?"

"Hy'roglyphics — pictures and things, you know, that don't seem
to mean anything."

"Have you got one of them papers, Tom?"

"No."

"Well then, how you going to find the marks?"

"I don't want any marks. They always bury it under a ha'nted
house or on an island, or under a dead tree that's got one limb
sticking out. Well, we've tried Jackson's Island a little, and we
can try it again some time; and there's the old ha'nted house up
the Still-House branch, and there's lots of deadlimb trees — dead
loads of 'em."

"Is it under all of them?"

"How you talk! No!"
