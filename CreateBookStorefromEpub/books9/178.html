<br/>The procession moved along the main avenue some three-quarters<br/>of a mile, and then groups and couples began to slip aside into<br/>branch avenues, fly along the dismal corridors, and take each other<br/>by surprise at points where the corridors joined again. Parties<br/>were able to elude each other for the space of half an hour without<br/>going beyond the "known" ground.<br/><br/>By-and-by, one group after another came straggling back to the<br/>mouth of the cave, panting, hilarious, smeared from head to foot<br/>with tallow drippings, daubed with clay, and entirely delighted<br/>with the success of the day. Then they were astonished to find that<br/>they had been taking no note of time and that night was about at<br/>hand. The clanging bell had been calling for half an hour. However,<br/>this sort of close to the day's adventures was romantic and<br/>therefore satisfactory. When the ferryboat with her wild freight<br/>pushed into the stream, nobody cared sixpence for the wasted time<br/>but the captain of the craft.<br/><br/>Huck was already upon his watch when the ferryboat's lights went<br/>glinting past the wharf. He heard no noise on board, for the young<br/>people were as subdued and still as people usually are who are<br/>nearly tired to death. He wondered what boat it was, and why she<br/>did not stop at the wharf — and then he dropped her out of his mind<br/>and put his attention upon his business. The night was growing<br/>cloudy and dark. Ten o'clock came, and the noise of vehicles<br/>ceased, scattered lights began to wink out, all straggling<br/>foot-passengers disappeared, the village betook itself to its<br/>slumbers and left the small watcher alone with the silence and the<br/>ghosts. Eleven o'clock came, and the tavern lights were put out;<br/>darkness everywhere, now. Huck waited what seemed a weary long<br/>time, but nothing happened. His faith was weakening. Was there any<br/>use? Was there really any use? Why not give it up and turn in?<br/><br/>A noise fell upon his ear. He was all attention in an instant.<br/>The alley door closed softly. He sprang to the corner of the brick<br/>store. The next moment two men brushed by him, and one seemed to<br/>have something under his arm. It must be that box! So they were<br/>going to remove the treasure. Why call Tom now? It would be absurd<br/>— the men would get away with the box and never be found again. No,<br/>he would stick to their wake and follow them; he would trust to the<br/>darkness for security from discovery. So communing with himself,<br/>Huck stepped out and glided along behind the men, cat-like, with<br/>bare feet, allowing them to keep just far enough ahead not to be<br/>invisible.<br/><br/>They moved up the river street three blocks, then turned to the<br/>left up a cross-street. They went straight ahead, then, until they<br/>came to the path that led up Cardiff Hill; this they took. They<br/>passed by the old Welshman's house, half-way up the hill, without<br/>hesitating, and still climbed upward. Good, thought Huck, they will<br/>bury it in the old quarry. But they never stopped at the quarry.<br/>They passed on, up the summit. They plunged into the narrow path<br/>between the tall sumach bushes, and were at once hidden in the<br/>gloom. Huck closed up and shortened his distance, now, for they<br/>would never be able to see him. He trotted along awhile; then<br/>slackened his pace, fearing he was gaining too fast; moved on a<br/>piece, then stopped altogether; listened; no sound; none, save that<br/>he seemed to hear the beating of his own heart. The hooting of an<br/>owl came over the hill — ominous sound! But no footsteps. Heavens,<br/>was everything lost! He was about to spring with winged feet, when<br/>a man cleared his throat not four feet from him! Huck's heart shot<br/>into his throat, but he swallowed it again; and then he stood there<br/>shaking as if a dozen agues had taken charge of him at once, and so<br/>weak that he thought he must surely fall to the ground. He knew<br/>where he was. He knew he was within five steps of the stile leading<br/>into Widow Douglas' grounds. Very well, he thought, let them bury<br/>it there; it won't be hard to find.<br/><br/>Now there was a voice — a very low voice — Injun Joe's:<br/><br/>"Damn her, maybe she's got company — there's lights, late as it<br/>is."<br/><br/>"I can't see any."<br/><br/>This was that stranger's voice — the stranger of the haunted<br/>house. A deadly chill went to Huck's heart — this, then, was the<br/>"revenge" job! His thought was, to fly. Then he remembered that the<br/>Widow Douglas had been kind to him more than once, and maybe these<br/>men were going to murder her. He wished he dared venture to warn<br/>her; but he knew he didn't dare — they might come and catch him. He<br/>thought all this and more in the moment that elapsed between the<br/>stranger's remark and Injun Joe's next — which was —<br/><br/>"Because the bush is in your way. Now — this way — now you see,<br/>don't you?"<br/><br/>
