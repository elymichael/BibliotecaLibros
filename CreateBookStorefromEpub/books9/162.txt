"Well, what's more dangerous than coming here in the daytime! —
anybody would suspicion us that saw us."

"I know that. But there warn't any other place as handy after
that fool of a job. I want to quit this shanty. I wanted to
yesterday, only it warn't any use trying to stir out of here, with
those infernal boys playing over there on the hill right in full
view."

"Those infernal boys" quaked again under the inspiration of this
remark, and thought how lucky it was that they had remembered it
was Friday and concluded to wait a day. They wished in their hearts
they had waited a year.

The two men got out some food and made a luncheon. After a long
and thoughtful silence, Injun Joe said:

"Look here, lad — you go back up the river where you belong.
Wait there till you hear from me. I'll take the chances on dropping
into this town just once more, for a look. We'll do that
'dangerous' job after I've spied around a little and think things
look well for it. Then for Texas! We'll leg it together!"

This was satisfactory. Both men presently fell to yawning, and
Injun Joe said:

"I'm dead for sleep! It's your turn to watch."

He curled down in the weeds and soon began to snore. His comrade
stirred him once or twice and he became quiet. Presently the
watcher began to nod; his head drooped lower and lower, both men
began to snore now.

The boys drew a long, grateful breath. Tom whispered:

"Now's our chance — come!"
