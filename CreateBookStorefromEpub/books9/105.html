But it roused only faint enthusiasm, which faded out, with no<br/>reply. Tom tried one or two other seductions; but they failed, too.<br/>It was discouraging work. Joe sat poking up the sand with a stick<br/>and looking very gloomy. Finally he said:<br/><br/>"Oh, boys, let's give it up. I want to go home. It's so<br/>lonesome."<br/><br/>"Oh no, Joe, you'll feel better by and by," said Tom. "Just<br/>think of the fishing that's here."<br/><br/>"I don't care for fishing. I want to go home."<br/><br/>"But, Joe, there ain't such another swimming-place<br/>anywhere."<br/><br/>"Swimming's no good. I don't seem to care for it, somehow, when<br/>there ain't anybody to say I sha'n't go in. I mean to go home."<br/><br/>"Oh, shucks! Baby! You want to see your mother, I reckon."<br/><br/>"Yes, I do want to see my mother — and you would, too, if you<br/>had one. I ain't any more baby than you are." And Joe snuffled a<br/>little.<br/><br/>"Well, we'll let the cry-baby go home to his mother, won't we,<br/>Huck? Poor thing — does it want to see its mother? And so it shall.<br/>You like it here, don't you, Huck? We'll stay, won't we?"<br/><br/>Huck said, "Y-e-s" — without any heart in it.<br/><br/>"I'll never speak to you again as long as I live," said Joe,<br/>rising. "There now!" And he moved moodily away and began to dress<br/>himself.<br/>
