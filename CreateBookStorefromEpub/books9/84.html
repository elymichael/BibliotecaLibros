Tom blanched and dropped his eyes.<br/><br/>"It's a bad sign," said Aunt Polly, gravely. "What you got on<br/>your mind, Tom?"<br/><br/>"Nothing. Nothing 't I know of." But the boy's hand shook so<br/>that he spilled his coffee.<br/><br/>"And you do talk such stuff," Sid said. "Last night you said,<br/>'It's blood, it's blood, that's what it is!' You said that over and<br/>over. And you said, 'Don't torment me so — I'll tell!' Tell what?<br/>What is it you'll tell?"<br/><br/>Everything was swimming before Tom. There is no telling what<br/>might have happened, now, but luckily the concern passed out of<br/>Aunt Polly's face and she came to Tom's relief without knowing it.<br/>She said:<br/><br/>"Sho! It's that dreadful murder. I dream about it most every<br/>night myself. Sometimes I dream it's me that done it."<br/><br/>Mary said she had been affected much the same way. Sid seemed<br/>satisfied. Tom got out of the presence as quick as he plausibly<br/>could, and after that he complained of toothache for a week, and<br/>tied up his jaws every night. He never knew that Sid lay nightly<br/>watching, and frequently slipped the bandage free and then leaned<br/>on his elbow listening a good while at a time, and afterward<br/>slipped the bandage back to its place again. Tom's distress of mind<br/>wore off gradually and the toothache grew irksome and was<br/>discarded. If Sid really managed to make anything out of Tom's<br/>disjointed mutterings, he kept it to himself.<br/><br/>It seemed to Tom that his schoolmates never would get done<br/>holding inquests on dead cats, and thus keeping his trouble present<br/>to his mind. Sid noticed that Tom never was coroner at one of these<br/>inquiries, though it had been his habit to take the lead in all new<br/>enterprises; he noticed, too, that Tom never acted as a witness —<br/>and that was strange; and Sid did not overlook the fact that Tom<br/>even showed a marked aversion to these inquests, and always avoided<br/>them when he could. Sid marvelled, but said nothing. However, even<br/>inquests went out of vogue at last, and ceased to torture Tom's<br/>conscience.<br/><br/>Every day or two, during this time of sorrow, Tom watched his<br/>opportunity and went to the little grated jail-window and smuggled<br/>such small comforts through to the "murderer" as he could get hold<br/>of. The jail was a trifling little brick den that stood in a marsh<br/>at the edge of the village, and no guards were afforded for it;<br/>indeed, it was seldom occupied. These offerings greatly helped to<br/>ease Tom's conscience.<br/><br/>The villagers had a strong desire to tar-and-feather Injun Joe<br/>and ride him on a rail, for body-snatching, but so formidable was<br/>his character that nobody could be found who was willing to take<br/>the lead in the matter, so it was dropped. He had been careful to<br/>begin both of his inquest-statements with the fight, without<br/>confessing the grave-robbery that preceded it; therefore it was<br/>deemed wisest not to try the case in the courts at present.<br/><br/><br/>
