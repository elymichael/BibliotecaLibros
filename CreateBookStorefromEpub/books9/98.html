For some time, now, the boys had been dully conscious of a<br/>peculiar sound in the distance, just as one sometimes is of the<br/>ticking of a clock which he takes no distinct note of. But now this<br/>mysterious sound became more pronounced, and forced a recognition.<br/>The boys started, glanced at each other, and then each assumed a<br/>listening attitude. There was a long silence, profound and<br/>unbroken; then a deep, sullen boom came floating down out of the<br/>distance.<br/><br/>"What is it!" exclaimed Joe, under his breath.<br/><br/>"I wonder," said Tom in a whisper.<br/><br/>"'Tain't thunder," said Huckleberry, in an awed tone, "becuz<br/>thunder —"<br/><br/>"Hark!" said Tom. "Listen — don't talk."<br/><br/>They waited a time that seemed an age, and then the same muffled<br/>boom troubled the solemn hush.<br/><br/>"Let's go and see."<br/><br/>They sprang to their feet and hurried to the shore toward the<br/>town. They parted the bushes on the bank and peered out over the<br/>water. The little steam ferryboat was about a mile below the<br/>village, drifting with the current. Her broad deck seemed crowded<br/>with people. There were a great many skiffs rowing about or<br/>floating with the stream in the neighborhood of the ferryboat, but<br/>the boys could not determine what the men in them were doing.<br/>Presently a great jet of white smoke burst from the ferryboat's<br/>side, and as it expanded and rose in a lazy cloud, that same dull<br/>throb of sound was borne to the listeners again.<br/><br/>"I know now!" exclaimed Tom; "somebody's drownded!"<br/><br/>"That's it!" said Huck; "they done that last summer, when Bill<br/>Turner got drownded; they shoot a cannon over the water, and that<br/>makes him come up to the top. Yes, and they take loaves of bread<br/>and put quicksilver in 'em and set 'em afloat, and wherever there's<br/>anybody that's drownded, they'll float right there and stop."<br/><br/>"Yes, I've heard about that," said Joe. "I wonder what makes the<br/>bread do that."<br/>
