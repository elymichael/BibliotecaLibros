"I was awful scared," said Huck, "and I run. I took out when the<br/>pistols went off, and I didn't stop for three mile. I've come now<br/>becuz I wanted to know about it, you know; and I come before<br/>daylight becuz I didn't want to run across them devils, even if<br/>they was dead."<br/><br/>"Well, poor chap, you do look as if you'd had a hard night of it<br/>— but there's a bed here for you when you've had your breakfast.<br/>No, they ain't dead, lad — we are sorry enough for that. You see we<br/>knew right where to put our hands on them, by your description; so<br/>we crept along on tiptoe till we got within fifteen feet of them —<br/>dark as a cellar that sumach path was — and just then I found I was<br/>going to sneeze. It was the meanest kind of luck! I tried to keep<br/>it back, but no use — 'twas bound to come, and it did come! I was<br/>in the lead with my pistol raised, and when the sneeze started<br/>those scoundrels a-rustling to get out of the path, I sung out,<br/>'Fire boys!' and blazed away at the place where the rustling was.<br/>So did the boys. But they were off in a jiffy, those villains, and<br/>we after them, down through the woods. I judge we never touched<br/>them. They fired a shot apiece as they started, but their bullets<br/>whizzed by and didn't do us any harm. As soon as we lost the sound<br/>of their feet we quit chasing, and went down and stirred up the<br/>constables. They got a posse together, and went off to guard the<br/>river bank, and as soon as it is light the sheriff and a gang are<br/>going to beat up the woods. My boys will be with them presently. I<br/>wish we had some sort of description of those rascals — 'twould<br/>help a good deal. But you couldn't see what they were like, in the<br/>dark, lad, I suppose?"<br/><br/>"Oh yes; I saw them down-town and follered them."<br/><br/>"Splendid! Describe them — describe them, my boy!"<br/><br/>"One's the old deaf and dumb Spaniard that's ben around here<br/>once or twice, and t'other's a mean-looking, ragged —"<br/><br/>"That's enough, lad, we know the men! Happened on them in the<br/>woods back of the widow's one day, and they slunk away. Off with<br/>you, boys, and tell the sheriff — get your breakfast to-morrow<br/>morning!"<br/><br/>The Welshman's sons departed at once. As they were leaving the<br/>room Huck sprang up and exclaimed:<br/><br/>"Oh, please don't tell anybody it was me that blowed on them!<br/>Oh, please!"<br/><br/>"All right if you say it, Huck, but you ought to have the credit<br/>of what you did."<br/><br/>"Oh no, no! Please don't tell!"<br/><br/>When the young men were gone, the old Welshman said:<br/>
