"We'll make quick work of this. There's an old rusty pick over<br/>amongst the weeds in the corner the other side of the fireplace — I<br/>saw it a minute ago."<br/><br/>He ran and brought the boys' pick and shovel. Injun Joe took the<br/>pick, looked it over critically, shook his head, muttered something<br/>to himself, and then began to use it. The box was soon unearthed.<br/>It was not very large; it was iron bound and had been very strong<br/>before the slow years had injured it. The men contemplated the<br/>treasure awhile in blissful silence.<br/><br/>"Pard, there's thousands of dollars here," said Injun Joe.<br/><br/>"'Twas always said that Murrel's gang used to be around here one<br/>summer," the stranger observed.<br/><br/>"I know it," said Injun Joe; "and this looks like it, I should<br/>say."<br/><br/>"Now you won't need to do that job."<br/><br/>The half-breed frowned. Said he:<br/><br/>"You don't know me. Least you don't know all about that thing.<br/>'Tain't robbery altogether — it's revenge!" and a wicked light<br/>flamed in his eyes. "I'll need your help in it. When it's finished<br/>— then Texas. Go home to your Nance and your kids, and stand by<br/>till you hear from me."<br/><br/>"Well — if you say so; what'll we do with this — bury it<br/>again?"<br/><br/>"Yes. [Ravishing delight overhead.] No! by the great Sachem, no!<br/>[Profound distress overhead.] I'd nearly forgot. That pick had<br/>fresh earth on it! [The boys were sick with terror in a moment.]<br/>What business has a pick and a shovel here? What business with<br/>fresh earth on them? Who brought them here — and where are they<br/>gone? Have you heard anybody? — seen anybody? What! bury it again<br/>and leave them to come and see the ground disturbed? Not exactly —<br/>not exactly. We'll take it to my den."<br/><br/>"Why, of course! Might have thought of that before. You mean<br/>Number One?"<br/>
