"Well, I was afeard."<br/><br/>"Why, Tom Sawyer, we wouldn't be alive two days if that got<br/>found out. You know that."<br/><br/>Tom felt more comfortable. After a pause:<br/><br/>"Huck, they couldn't anybody get you to tell, could they?"<br/><br/>"Get me to tell? Why, if I wanted that half-breed devil to<br/>drownd me they could get me to tell. They ain't no different<br/>way."<br/><br/>"Well, that's all right, then. I reckon we're safe as long as we<br/>keep mum. But let's swear again, anyway. It's more surer."<br/><br/>"I'm agreed."<br/><br/>So they swore again with dread solemnities.<br/><br/>"What is the talk around, Huck? I've heard a power of it."<br/><br/>"Talk? Well, it's just Muff Potter, Muff Potter, Muff Potter all<br/>the time. It keeps me in a sweat, constant, so's I want to hide<br/>som'ers."<br/><br/>"That's just the same way they go on round me. I reckon he's a<br/>goner. Don't you feel sorry for him, sometimes?"<br/>
