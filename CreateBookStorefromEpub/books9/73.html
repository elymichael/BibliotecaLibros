"Why, I know it, Tom."<br/><br/>Tom thought a while, then he said:<br/><br/>"Who'll tell? We?"<br/><br/>"What are you talking about? S'pose something happened and Injun<br/>Joe didn't hang? Why, he'd kill us some time or other, just as dead<br/>sure as we're a laying here."<br/><br/>"That's just what I was thinking to myself, Huck."<br/><br/>"If anybody tells, let Muff Potter do it, if he's fool enough.<br/>He's generally drunk enough."<br/><br/>Tom said nothing â€” went on thinking. Presently he whispered:<br/><br/>"Huck, Muff Potter don't know it. How can he tell?"<br/><br/>"What's the reason he don't know it?"<br/><br/>"Because he'd just got that whack when Injun Joe done it. D'you<br/>reckon he could see anything? D'you reckon he knowed anything?"<br/><br/>"By hokey, that's so, Tom!"<br/>
