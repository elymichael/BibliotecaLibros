Tom arrived at home in a dreary mood, and the first thing his
aunt said to him showed him that he had brought his sorrows to an
unpromising market:

"Tom, I've a notion to skin you alive!"

"Auntie, what have I done?"

"Well, you've done enough. Here I go over to Sereny Harper, like
an old softy, expecting I'm going to make her believe all that
rubbage about that dream, when lo and behold you she'd found out
from Joe that you was over here and heard all the talk we had that
night. Tom, I don't know what is to become of a boy that will act
like that. It makes me feel so bad to think you could let me go to
Sereny Harper and make such a fool of myself and never say a
word."

This was a new aspect of the thing. His smartness of the morning
had seemed to Tom a good joke before, and very ingenious. It merely
looked mean and shabby now. He hung his head and could not think of
anything to say for a moment. Then he said:

"Auntie, I wish I hadn't done it â€” but I didn't think."
