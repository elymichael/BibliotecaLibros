"Oh, kings have slathers of them."

"Well, I don' know no kings, Tom."

"I reckon you don't. But if you was to go to Europe you'd see a
raft of 'em hopping around."

"Do they hop?"

"Hop? — your granny! No!"

"Well, what did you say they did, for?"

"Shucks, I only meant you'd see 'em — not hopping, of course —
what do they want to hop for? — but I mean you'd just see 'em —
scattered around, you know, in a kind of a general way. Like that
old humpbacked Richard."

"Richard? What's his other name?"

"He didn't have any other name. Kings don't have any but a given
name."

"No?"

"But they don't."
