"Oh, that will be fun!"<br/><br/>Then Becky reflected a moment and said:<br/><br/>"But what will mamma say?"<br/><br/>"How'll she ever know?"<br/><br/>The girl turned the idea over in her mind, and said<br/>reluctantly:<br/><br/>"I reckon it's wrong — but —"<br/><br/>"But shucks! Your mother won't know, and so what's the harm? All<br/>she wants is that you'll be safe; and I bet you she'd 'a' said go<br/>there if she'd 'a' thought of it. I know she would!"<br/><br/>The Widow Douglas' splendid hospitality was a tempting bait. It<br/>and Tom's persuasions presently carried the day. So it was decided<br/>to say nothing anybody about the night's programme. Presently it<br/>occurred to Tom that maybe Huck might come this very night and give<br/>the signal. The thought took a deal of the spirit out of his<br/>anticipations. Still he could not bear to give up the fun at Widow<br/>Douglas'. And why should he give it up, he reasoned — the signal<br/>did not come the night before, so why should it be any more likely<br/>to come to-night? The sure fun of the evening outweighed the<br/>uncertain treasure; and, boylike, he determined to yield to the<br/>stronger inclination and not allow himself to think of the box of<br/>money another time that day.<br/><br/>Three miles below town the ferryboat stopped at the mouth of a<br/>woody hollow and tied up. The crowd swarmed ashore and soon the<br/>forest distances and craggy heights echoed far and near with<br/>shoutings and laughter. All the different ways of getting hot and<br/>tired were gone through with, and by-and-by the rovers straggled<br/>back to camp fortified with responsible appetites, and then the<br/>destruction of the good things began. After the feast there was a<br/>refreshing season of rest and chat in the shade of spreading oaks.<br/>By-and-by somebody shouted:<br/><br/>"Who's ready for the cave?"<br/><br/>Everybody was. Bundles of candles were procured, and straightway<br/>there was a general scamper up the hill. The mouth of the cave was<br/>up the hillside — an opening shaped like a letter A. Its massive<br/>oaken door stood unbarred. Within was a small chamber, chilly as an<br/>ice-house, and walled by Nature with solid limestone that was dewy<br/>with a cold sweat. It was romantic and mysterious to stand here in<br/>the deep gloom and look out upon the green valley shining in the<br/>sun. But the impressiveness of the situation quickly wore off, and<br/>the romping began again. The moment a candle was lighted there was<br/>a general rush upon the owner of it; a struggle and a gallant<br/>defence followed, but the candle was soon knocked down or blown<br/>out, and then there was a glad clamor of laughter and a new chase.<br/>But all things have an end. By-and-by the procession went filing<br/>down the steep descent of the main avenue, the flickering rank of<br/>lights dimly revealing the lofty walls of rock almost to their<br/>point of junction sixty feet overhead. This main avenue was not<br/>more than eight or ten feet wide. Every few steps other lofty and<br/>still narrower crevices branched from it on either hand — for<br/>McDougal's cave was but a vast labyrinth of crooked aisles that ran<br/>into each other and out again and led nowhere. It was said that one<br/>might wander days and nights together through its intricate tangle<br/>of rifts and chasms, and never find the end of the cave; and that<br/>he might go down, and down, and still down, into the earth, and it<br/>was just the same — labyrinth under labyrinth, and no end to any of<br/>them. No man "knew" the cave. That was an impossible thing. Most of<br/>the young men knew a portion of it, and it was not customary to<br/>venture much beyond this known portion. Tom Sawyer knew as much of<br/>the cave as any one.<br/>
