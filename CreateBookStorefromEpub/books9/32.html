"Ah, that's it. I thought there was more to it, maybe. That's<br/>very well. But you've another one I daresay, and you'll tell it to<br/>me, won't you?"<br/><br/>"Tell the gentleman your other name, Thomas," said Walters, "and<br/>say sir. You mustn't forget your manners."<br/><br/>"Thomas Sawyer — sir."<br/><br/>"That's it! That's a good boy. Fine boy. Fine, manly little<br/>fellow. Two thousand verses is a great many — very, very great<br/>many. And you never can be sorry for the trouble you took to learn<br/>them; for knowledge is worth more than anything there is in the<br/>world; it's what makes great men and good men; you'll be a great<br/>man and a good man yourself, some day, Thomas, and then you'll look<br/>back and say, It's all owing to the precious Sunday-school<br/>privileges of my boyhood — it's all owing to my dear teachers that<br/>taught me to learn — it's all owing to the good superintendent, who<br/>encouraged me, and watched over me, and gave me a beautiful Bible —<br/>a splendid elegant Bible — to keep and have it all for my own,<br/>always — it's all owing to right bringing up! That is what you will<br/>say, Thomas — and you wouldn't take any money for those two<br/>thousand verses — no indeed you wouldn't. And now you wouldn't mind<br/>telling me and this lady some of the things you've learned — no, I<br/>know you wouldn't — for we are proud of little boys that learn.<br/>Now, no doubt you know the names of all the twelve disciples. Won't<br/>you tell us the names of the first two that were appointed?"<br/><br/>Tom was tugging at a button-hole and looking sheepish. He<br/>blushed, now, and his eyes fell. Mr. Walters' heart sank within<br/>him. He said to himself, it is not possible that the boy can answer<br/>the simplest question — why did the Judge ask him? Yet he felt<br/>obliged to speak up and say:<br/><br/>"Answer the gentleman, Thomas — don't be afraid."<br/><br/>Tom still hung fire.<br/><br/>"Now I know you'll tell me," said the lady. "The names of the<br/>first two disciples were —"<br/><br/>"David and Goliah!"<br/><br/>Let us draw the curtain of charity over the rest of the<br/>scene.<br/><br/><br/>
