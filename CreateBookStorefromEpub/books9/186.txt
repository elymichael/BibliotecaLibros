Of course this excited a curiosity so vast that it almost
belittled the main matter — but the Welshman allowed it to eat into
the vitals of his visitors, and through them be transmitted to the
whole town, for he refused to part with his secret. When all else
had been learned, the widow said:

"I went to sleep reading in bed and slept straight through all
that noise. Why didn't you come and wake me?"

"We judged it warn't worth while. Those fellows warn't likely to
come again — they hadn't any tools left to work with, and what was
the use of waking you up and scaring you to death? My three negro
men stood guard at your house all the rest of the night. They've
just come back."

More visitors came, and the story had to be told and retold for
a couple of hours more.

There was no Sabbath-school during day-school vacation, but
everybody was early at church. The stirring event was well
canvassed. News came that not a sign of the two villains had been
yet discovered. When the sermon was finished, Judge Thatcher's wife
dropped alongside of Mrs. Harper as she moved down the aisle with
the crowd and said:

"Is my Becky going to sleep all day? I just expected she would
be tired to death."

"Your Becky?"

"Yes," with a startled look — "didn't she stay with you last
night?"

"Why, no."

Mrs. Thatcher turned pale, and sank into a pew, just as Aunt
Polly, talking briskly with a friend, passed by. Aunt Polly
said:

"Good-morning, Mrs. Thatcher. Good-morning, Mrs. Harper. I've
got a boy that's turned up missing. I reckon my Tom stayed at your
house last night — one of you. And now he's afraid to come to
church. I've got to settle with him."
