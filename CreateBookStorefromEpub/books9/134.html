"A Vision "Dark and tempestuous was night. Around the throne on<br/>high not a single star quivered; but the deep intonations of the<br/>heavy thunder constantly vibrated upon the ear; whilst the terrific<br/>lightning revelled in angry mood through the cloudy chambers of<br/>heaven, seeming to scorn the power exerted over its terror by the<br/>illustrious Franklin! Even the boisterous winds unanimously came<br/>forth from their mystic homes, and blustered about as if to enhance<br/>by their aid the wildness of the scene.<br/><br/>"At such a time,so dark,so dreary, for human sympathy my very<br/>spirit sighed; but instead thereof,<br/><br/>"'My dearest friend, my counsellor, my comforter and guide — My<br/>joy in grief, my second bliss in joy,' came to my side. She moved<br/>like one of those bright beings pictured in the sunny walks of<br/>fancy's Eden by the romantic and young, a queen of beauty unadorned<br/>save by her own transcendent loveliness. So soft was her step, it<br/>failed to make even a sound, and but for the magical thrill<br/>imparted by her genial touch, as other unobtrusive beauties, she<br/>would have glided away un-perceived — unsought. A strange sadness<br/>rested upon her features, like icy tears upon the robe of December,<br/>as she pointed to the contending elements without, and bade me<br/>contemplate the two beings presented."<br/><br/>This nightmare occupied some ten pages of manuscript and wound<br/>up with a sermon so destructive of all hope to non-Presbyterians<br/>that it took the first prize. This composition was considered to be<br/>the very finest effort of the evening. The mayor of the village, in<br/>delivering the prize to the author of it, made a warm speech in<br/>which he said that it was by far the most "eloquent" thing he had<br/>ever listened to, and that Daniel Webster himself might well be<br/>proud of it. It may be remarked, in passing, that the number of<br/>compositions in which the word "beauteous" was over-fondled, and<br/>human experience referred to as "life's page," was up to the usual<br/>average.<br/><br/>Now the master, mellow almost to the verge of geniality, put his<br/>chair aside, turned his back to the audience, and began to draw a<br/>map of America on the blackboard, to exercise the geography class<br/>upon. But he made a sad business of it with his unsteady hand, and<br/>a smothered titter rippled over the house. He knew what the matter<br/>was, and set himself to right it. He sponged out lines and remade<br/>them; but he only distorted them more than ever, and the tittering<br/>was more pronounced. He threw his entire attention upon his work,<br/>now, as if determined not to be put down by the mirth. He felt that<br/>all eyes were fastened upon him; he imagined he was succeeding, and<br/>yet the tittering continued; it even manifestly increased. And well<br/>it might. There was a garret above, pierced with a scuttle over his<br/>head; and down through this scuttle came a cat, suspended around<br/>the haunches by a string; she had a rag tied about her head and<br/>jaws to keep her from mewing; as she slowly descended she curved<br/>upward and clawed at the string, she swung downward and clawed at<br/>the intangible air. The tittering rose higher and higher — the cat<br/>was within six inches of the absorbed teacher's head — down, down,<br/>a little lower, and she grabbed his wig with her desperate claws,<br/>clung to it, and was snatched up into the garret in an instant with<br/>her trophy still in her possession! And how the light did blaze<br/>abroad from the master's bald pate — for the sign-painter's boy had<br/>gilded it!<br/><br/>That broke up the meeting. The boys were avenged. Vacation had<br/>come.<br/><br/>NOTE:— The pretended "compositions" quoted in this chapter are<br/>taken without alteration from a volume entitled "Prose and Poetry,<br/>by a Western Lady" — but they are exactly and precisely after the<br/>schoolgirl pattern, and hence are much happier than any mere<br/>imitations could be.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
