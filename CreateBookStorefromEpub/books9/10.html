<br/>"Bother! Well, go 'long with you. I'd made sure you'd played<br/>hookey and been a-swimming. But I forgive ye, Tom. I reckon you're<br/>a kind of a singed cat, as the saying is — better'n you look. This<br/>time."<br/><br/>She was half sorry her sagacity had miscarried, and half glad<br/>that Tom had stumbled into obedient conduct for once.<br/><br/>But Sidney said:<br/><br/>"Well, now, if I didn't think you sewed his collar with white<br/>thread, but it's black."<br/><br/>"Why, I did sew it with white! Tom!"<br/><br/>But Tom did not wait for the rest. As he went out at the door he<br/>said:<br/><br/>"Siddy, I'll lick you for that."<br/><br/>In a safe place Tom examined two large needles which were thrust<br/>into the lapels of his jacket, and had thread bound about them —<br/>one needle carried white thread and the other black. He said:<br/><br/>"She'd never noticed if it hadn't been for Sid. Confound it!<br/>sometimes she sews it with white, and sometimes she sews it with<br/>black. I wish to geeminy she'd stick to one or t'other — I can't<br/>keep the run of 'em. But I bet you I'll lam Sid for that. I'll<br/>learn him!"<br/><br/>He was not the Model Boy of the village. He knew the model boy<br/>very well though — and loathed him.<br/><br/>
