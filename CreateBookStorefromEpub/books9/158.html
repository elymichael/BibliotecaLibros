<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>26<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>About noon the next day the boys arrived at the dead tree; they<br/>had come for their tools. Tom was impatient to go to the haunted<br/>house; Huck was measurably so, also — but suddenly said:<br/>"Lookyhere, Tom, do you know what day it is?"<br/><br/>Tom mentally ran over the days of the week, and then quickly<br/>lifted his eyes with a startled look in them —<br/><br/>"My! I never once thought of it, Huck!"<br/><br/>"Well, I didn't neither, but all at once it popped onto me that<br/>it was Friday."<br/><br/>"Blame it, a body can't be too careful, Huck. We might 'a' got<br/>into an awful scrape, tackling such a thing on a Friday."<br/><br/>"Might! Better say we would! There's some lucky days, maybe, but<br/>Friday ain't."<br/><br/>
