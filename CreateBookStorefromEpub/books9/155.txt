The boys were there that night, about the appointed time. They
sat in the shadow waiting. It was a lonely place, and an hour made
solemn by old traditions. Spirits whispered in the rustling leaves,
ghosts lurked in the murky nooks, the deep baying of a hound
floated up out of the distance, an owl answered with his sepulchral
note. The boys were subdued by these solemnities, and talked
little. By and by they judged that twelve had come; they marked
where the shadow fell, and began to dig. Their hopes commenced to
rise. Their interest grew stronger, and their industry kept pace
with it. The hole deepened and still deepened, but every time their
hearts jumped to hear the pick strike upon something, they only
suffered a new disappointment. It was only a stone or a chunk. At
last Tom said:

"It ain't any use, Huck, we're wrong again."

"Well, but we can't be wrong. We spotted the shadder to a
dot."

"I know it, but then there's another thing."

"What's that?".

"Why, we only guessed at the time. Like enough it was too late
or too early."

Huck dropped his shovel.

"That's it," said he. "That's the very trouble. We got to give
this one up. We can't ever tell the right time, and besides this
kind of thing's too awful, here this time of night with witches and
ghosts a-fluttering around so. I feel as if something's behind me
all the time; and I'm afeard to turn around, becuz maybe there's
others in front a-waiting for a chance. I been creeping all over,
ever since I got here."

"Well, I've been pretty much so, too, Huck. They most always put
in a dead man when they bury a treasure under a tree, to look out
for it."

"Lordy!"
