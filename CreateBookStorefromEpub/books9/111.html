<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>17<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>But there was no hilarity in the little town that same tranquil<br/>Saturday afternoon. The Harpers, and Aunt Polly's family, were<br/>being put into mourning, with great grief and many tears. An<br/>unusual quiet possessed the village, although it was ordinarily<br/>quiet enough, in all conscience. The villagers conducted their<br/>concerns with an absent air, and talked little; but they sighed<br/>often. The Saturday holiday seemed a burden to the children. They<br/>had no heart in their sports, and gradually gave them up.<br/><br/>In the afternoon Becky Thatcher found herself moping about the<br/>deserted schoolhouse yard, and feeling very melancholy. But she<br/>found nothing there to comfort her. She soliloquized:<br/><br/>"Oh, if I only had a brass andiron-knob again! But I haven't got<br/>anything now to remember him by." And she choked back a little<br/>sob.<br/><br/>Presently she stopped, and said to herself:<br/><br/>"It was right here. Oh, if it was to do over again, I wouldn't<br/>say that — I wouldn't say it for the whole world. But he's gone<br/>now; I'll never, never, never see him any more."<br/><br/>This thought broke her down, and she wandered away, with tears<br/>rolling down her cheeks. Then quite a group of boys and girls —<br/>playmates of Tom's and Joe's — came by, and stood looking over the<br/>paling fence and talking in reverent tones of how Tom did so-and-so<br/>the last time they saw him, and how Joe said this and that small<br/>trifle (pregnant with awful prophecy, as they could easily see<br/>now!) — and each speaker pointed out the exact spot where the lost<br/>lads stood at the time, and then added something like "and I was<br/>a-standing just so — just as I am now, and as if you was him — I<br/>was as close as that — and he smiled, just this way — and then<br/>something seemed to go all over me, like — awful, you know — and I<br/>never thought what it meant, of course, but I can see now!"<br/><br/>
