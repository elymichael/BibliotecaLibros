"Now, Huck, the storm's over, and I'll go home. It'll begin to<br/>be daylight in a couple of hours. You go back and watch that long,<br/>will you?"<br/><br/>"I said I would, Tom, and I will. I'll ha'nt that tavern every<br/>night for a year! I'll sleep all day and I'll stand watch all<br/>night."<br/><br/>"That's all right. Now, where you going to sleep?"<br/><br/>"In Ben Rogers' hayloft. He lets me, and so does his pap's<br/>nigger man, Uncle Jake. I tote water for Uncle Jake whenever he<br/>wants me to, and any time I ask him he gives me a little something<br/>to eat if he can spare it. That's a mighty good nigger, Tom. He<br/>likes me, becuz I don't ever act as if I was above him. Sometime<br/>I've set right down and eat with him. But you needn't tell that. A<br/>body's got to do things when he's awful hungry he wouldn't want to<br/>do as a steady thing."<br/><br/>"Well, if I don't want you in the daytime, I'll let you sleep. I<br/>won't come bothering around. Any time you see something's up, in<br/>the night, just skip right around and maow."<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
