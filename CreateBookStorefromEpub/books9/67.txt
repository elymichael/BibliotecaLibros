The boys bent their heads together and scarcely breathed. A
muffled sound of voices floated up from the far end of the
graveyard.

"Look! See there!" whispered Tom. "What is it?"

"It's devil-fire. Oh, Tom, this is awful."

Some vague figures approached through the gloom, swinging an
old-fashioned tin lantern that freckled the ground with innumerable
little spangles of light. Presently Huckleberry whispered with a
shudder:

"It's the devils sure enough. Three of 'em! Lordy, Tom, we're
goners! Can you pray?"

"I'll try, but don't you be afeard. They ain't going to hurt us.
'Now I lay me down to sleep, I —'"

"Sh!"

"What is it, Huck?"

"They're humans! One of 'em is, anyway. One of 'em's old Muff
Potter's voice."

"No — 'tain't so, is it?"

"I bet I know it. Don't you stir nor budge. He ain't sharp
enough to notice us. Drunk, the same as usual, likely — blamed old
rip!"
