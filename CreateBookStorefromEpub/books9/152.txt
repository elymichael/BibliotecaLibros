"Why, so as to have something to live on, by and by."

"Oh, that ain't any use. Pap would come back to thish-yer town
some day and get his claws on it if I didn't hurry up, and I tell
you he'd clean it out pretty quick. What you going to do with
yourn, Tom?"

"I'm going to buy a new drum, and a sure-'nough sword, and a red
necktie and a bull pup, and get married."

"Married!"

"That's it."

"Tom, you — why, you ain't in your right mind."

"Wait — you'll see."

"Well, that's the foolishest thing you could do. Look at pap and
my mother. Fight! Why, they used to fight all the time. I remember,
mighty well."

"That ain't anything. The girl I'm going to marry won't
fight."

"Tom, I reckon they're all alike. They'll all comb a body. Now
you better think 'bout this awhile. I tell you you better. What's
the name of the gal?"

"It ain't a gal at all — it's a girl."
