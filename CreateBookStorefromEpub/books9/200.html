"Why, Huck, I never told on that tavern-keeper. You know his<br/>tavern was all right the Saturday I went to the picnic. Don't you<br/>remember you was to watch there that night?"<br/><br/>"Oh yes! Why, it seems 'bout a year ago. It was that very night<br/>that I follered Injun Joe to the widder's."<br/><br/>"You followed him?"<br/><br/>"Yes — but you keep mum. I reckon Injun Joe's left friends<br/>behind him, and I don't want 'em souring on me and doing me mean<br/>tricks. If it hadn't ben for me he'd be down in Texas now, all<br/>right."<br/><br/>Then Huck told his entire adventure in confidence to Tom, who<br/>had only heard of the Welshman's part of it before.<br/><br/>"Well," said Huck, presently, coming back to the main question,<br/>"whoever nipped the whiskey in No. 2, nipped the money, too, I<br/>reckon — anyways it's a goner for us, Tom."<br/><br/>"Huck, that money wasn't ever in No. 2!"<br/><br/>"What!" Huck searched his comrade's face keenly. "Tom, have you<br/>got on the track of that money again?"<br/><br/>"Huck, it's in the cave!"<br/><br/>Huck's eyes blazed.<br/><br/>"Say it again, Tom."<br/>
