<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>29<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>The first thing Tom heard on Friday morning was a glad piece of<br/>news — Judge Thatcher's family had come back to town the night<br/>before. Both Injun Joe and the treasure sunk into secondary<br/>importance for a moment, and Becky took the chief place in the<br/>boy's interest. He saw her and they had an exhausting good time<br/>playing "hi-spy" and "gully-keeper" with a crowd of their<br/>schoolmates. The day was completed and crowned in a peculiarly<br/>satisfactory way: Becky teased her mother to appoint the next day<br/>for the long-promised and long-delayed picnic, and she consented.<br/>The child's delight was boundless; and Tom's not more moderate. The<br/>invitations were sent out before sunset, and straightway the young<br/>folks of the village were thrown into a fever of preparation and<br/>pleasurable anticipation. Tom's excitement enabled him to keep<br/>awake until a pretty late hour, and he had good hopes of hearing<br/>Huck's "maow," and of having his treasure to astonish Becky and the<br/>picnickers with, next day; but he was disappointed. No signal came<br/>that night. Morning came, eventually, and by ten or eleven o'clock<br/>a giddy and rollicking company were gathered at Judge Thatcher's,<br/>and everything was ready for a start. It was not the custom for<br/>elderly people to mar the picnics with their presence. The children<br/>were considered safe enough under the wings of a few young ladies<br/>of eighteen and a few young gentlemen of twenty-three or<br/>thereabouts. The old steam ferryboat was chartered for the<br/>occasion; presently the gay throng filed up the main street laden<br/>with provision-baskets. Sid was sick and had to miss the fun; Mary<br/>remained at home to entertain him. The last thing Mrs. Thatcher<br/>said to Becky, was:<br/><br/>"You'll not get back till late. Perhaps you'd better stay all<br/>night with some of the girls that live near the ferry-landing,<br/>child."<br/><br/>"Then I'll stay with Susy Harper, mamma."<br/><br/>"Very well. And mind and behave yourself and don't be any<br/>trouble."<br/><br/>Presently, as they tripped along, Tom said to Becky:<br/><br/>"Say — I'll tell you what we'll do. 'Stead of going to Joe<br/>Harper's we'll climb right up the hill and stop at the Widow<br/>Douglas'. She'll have ice-cream! She has it most every day — dead<br/>loads of it. And she'll be awful glad to have us."<br/><br/>
