"Oh, won't it be fun! You going to have all the girls and<br/>boys?"<br/><br/>"Yes, every one that's friends to me — or wants to be"; and she<br/>glanced ever so furtively at Tom, but he talked right along to Amy<br/>Lawrence about the terrible storm on the island, and how the<br/>lightning tore the great sycamore tree "all to flinders" while he<br/>was "standing within three feet of it."<br/><br/>"Oh, may I come?" said Grace Miller.<br/><br/>"Yes."<br/><br/>"And me?" said Sally Rogers.<br/><br/>"Yes."<br/><br/>"And me, too?" said Susy Harper. "And Joe?"<br/><br/>"Yes."<br/><br/>And so on, with clapping of joyful hands till all the group had<br/>begged for invitations but Tom and Amy. Then Tom turned coolly<br/>away, still talking, and took Amy with him. Becky's lips trembled<br/>and the tears came to her eyes; she hid these signs with a forced<br/>gayety and went on chattering, but the life had gone out of the<br/>picnic, now, and out of everything else; she got away as soon as<br/>she could and hid herself and had what her sex call "a good cry."<br/>Then she sat moody, with wounded pride, till the bell rang. She<br/>roused up, now, with a vindictive cast in her eye, and gave her<br/>plaited tails a shake and said she knew what she'd do.<br/><br/>At recess Tom continued his flirtation with Amy with jubilant<br/>self-satisfaction. And he kept drifting about to find Becky and<br/>lacerate her with the performance. At last he spied her, but there<br/>was a sudden falling of his mercury. She was sitting cosily on a<br/>little bench behind the schoolhouse looking at a picture-book with<br/>Alfred Temple — and so absorbed were they, and their heads so close<br/>together over the book, that they did not seem to be conscious of<br/>anything in the world besides. Jealousy ran red-hot through Tom's<br/>veins. He began to hate himself for throwing away the chance Becky<br/>had offered for a reconciliation. He called himself a fool, and all<br/>the hard names he could think of. He wanted to cry with vexation.<br/>Amy chatted happily along, as they walked, for her heart was<br/>singing, but Tom's tongue had lost its function. He did not hear<br/>what Amy was saying, and whenever she paused expectantly he could<br/>only stammer an awkward assent, which was as often misplaced as<br/>otherwise. He kept drifting to the rear of the schoolhouse, again<br/>and again, to sear his eyeballs with the hateful spectacle there.<br/>He could not help it. And it maddened him to see, as he thought he<br/>saw, that Becky Thatcher never once suspected that he was even in<br/>the land of the living. But she did see, nevertheless; and she knew<br/>she was winning her fight, too, and was glad to see him suffer as<br/>she had suffered.<br/><br/>Amy's happy prattle became intolerable. Tom hinted at things he<br/>had to attend to; things that must be done; and time was fleeting.<br/>But in vain — the girl chirped on. Tom thought, "Oh, hang her,<br/>ain't I ever going to get rid of her?" At last he must be attending<br/>to those things — and she said artlessly that she would be "around"<br/>when school let out. And he hastened away, hating her for it.<br/>
