"Now, Huck, the storm's over, and I'll go home. It'll begin to
be daylight in a couple of hours. You go back and watch that long,
will you?"

"I said I would, Tom, and I will. I'll ha'nt that tavern every
night for a year! I'll sleep all day and I'll stand watch all
night."

"That's all right. Now, where you going to sleep?"

"In Ben Rogers' hayloft. He lets me, and so does his pap's
nigger man, Uncle Jake. I tote water for Uncle Jake whenever he
wants me to, and any time I ask him he gives me a little something
to eat if he can spare it. That's a mighty good nigger, Tom. He
likes me, becuz I don't ever act as if I was above him. Sometime
I've set right down and eat with him. But you needn't tell that. A
body's got to do things when he's awful hungry he wouldn't want to
do as a steady thing."

"Well, if I don't want you in the daytime, I'll let you sleep. I
won't come bothering around. Any time you see something's up, in
the night, just skip right around and maow."
