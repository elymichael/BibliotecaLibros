<br/>"I would I knew what 'tis about!" he exclaimed, with all a boy's<br/>curiosity in such happenings.<br/><br/>"Thou art the King!" solemnly responded the Earl, with a<br/>reverence. "Have I your Grace's leave to act?"<br/><br/>"O blithely, yes! &#160;O gladly, yes!" exclaimed Tom excitedly,<br/>adding to himself with a lively sense of satisfaction, "In truth,<br/>being a king is not all dreariness—it hath its compensations and<br/>conveniences."<br/><br/>The Earl called a page, and sent him to the captain of the guard<br/>with the order—<br/><br/>"Let the mob be halted, and inquiry made concerning the occasion<br/>of its movement. &#160;By the King's command!"<br/><br/>A few seconds later a long rank of the royal guards, cased in<br/>flashing steel, filed out at the gates and formed across the<br/>highway in front of the multitude. &#160;A messenger returned, to<br/>report that the crowd were following a man, a woman, and a young<br/>girl to execution for crimes committed against the peace and<br/>dignity of the realm.<br/><br/>Death—and a violent death—for these poor unfortunates! &#160;The<br/>thought wrung Tom's heart-strings. &#160;The spirit of compassion<br/>took control of him, to the exclusion of all other considerations;<br/>he never thought of the offended laws, or of the grief or loss<br/>which these three criminals had inflicted upon their victims; he<br/>could think of nothing but the scaffold and the grisly fate hanging<br/>over the heads of the condemned. &#160;His concern made him even<br/>forget, for the moment, that he was but the false shadow of a king,<br/>not the substance; and before he knew it he had blurted out the<br/>command—<br/><br/>"Bring them here!"<br/><br/>Then he blushed scarlet, and a sort of apology sprung to his<br/>lips; but observing that his order had wrought no sort of surprise<br/>in the Earl or the waiting page, he suppressed the words he was<br/>about to utter. &#160;The page, in the most matter-of-course way,<br/>made a profound obeisance and retired backwards out of the room to<br/>deliver the command. &#160;Tom experienced a glow of pride and a<br/>renewed sense of the compensating advantages of the kingly office.<br/>He said to himself, "Truly it is like what I was used to feel when<br/>I read the old priest's tales, and did imagine mine own self a<br/>prince, giving law and command to all, saying 'Do this, do that,'<br/>whilst none durst offer let or hindrance to my will."<br/><br/>Now the doors swung open; one high-sounding title after another<br/>was announced, the personages owning them followed, and the place<br/>was quickly half-filled with noble folk and finery. &#160;But Tom<br/>was hardly conscious of the presence of these people, so wrought up<br/>was he and so intensely absorbed in that other and more interesting<br/>matter. &#160;He seated himself absently in his chair of state, and<br/>turned his eyes upon the door with manifestations of impatient<br/>expectancy; seeing which, the company forbore to trouble him, and<br/>fell to chatting a mixture of public business and court gossip one<br/>with another.<br/><br/>
