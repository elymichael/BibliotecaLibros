<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>11<br/>At Guildhall<br/><br/><br/>The royal barge, attended by its gorgeous fleet, took its<br/>stately way down the Thames through the wilderness of illuminated<br/>boats. The air was laden with music; the river banks were beruffled<br/>with joy-flames; the distant city lay in a soft luminous glow from<br/>its countless invisible bonfires; above it rose many a slender<br/>spire into the sky, incrusted with sparkling lights, wherefore in<br/>their remoteness they seemed like jewelled lances thrust aloft; as<br/>the fleet swept along, it was greeted from the banks with a<br/>continuous hoarse roar of cheers and the ceaseless flash and boom<br/>of artillery.<br/><br/>To Tom Canty, half buried in his silken cushions, these sounds<br/>and this spectacle were a wonder unspeakably sublime and<br/>astonishing. To his little friends at his side, the Princess<br/>Elizabeth and the Lady Jane Grey, they were nothing.<br/><br/>Arrived at the Dowgate, the fleet was towed up the limpid<br/>Walbrook (whose channel has now been for two centuries buried out<br/>of sight under acres of buildings) to Bucklersbury, past houses and<br/>under bridges populous with merry-makers and brilliantly lighted,<br/>and at last came to a halt in a basin where now is Barge Yard, in<br/>the centre of the ancient city of London. &#160;Tom disembarked,<br/>and he and his gallant procession crossed Cheapside and made a<br/>short march through the Old Jewry and Basinghall Street to the<br/>Guildhall.<br/><br/>Tom and his little ladies were received with due ceremony by the<br/>Lord Mayor and the Fathers of the City, in their gold chains and<br/>scarlet robes of state, and conducted to a rich canopy of state at<br/>the head of the great hall, preceded by heralds making<br/>proclamation, and by the Mace and the City Sword. &#160;The lords<br/>and ladies who were to attend upon Tom and his two small friends<br/>took their places behind their chairs.<br/><br/>At a lower table the Court grandees and other guests of noble<br/>degree were seated, with the magnates of the city; the commoners<br/>took places at a multitude of tables on the main floor of the hall.<br/>&#160;From their lofty vantage-ground the giants Gog and Magog, the<br/>ancient guardians of the city, contemplated the spectacle below<br/>them with eyes grown familiar to it in forgotten generations.<br/>&#160;There was a bugle-blast and a proclamation, and a fat butler<br/>appeared in a high perch in the leftward wall, followed by his<br/>servitors bearing with impressive solemnity a royal baron of beef,<br/>smoking hot and ready for the knife.<br/><br/>After grace, Tom (being instructed) rose—and the whole house<br/>with him—and drank from a portly golden loving-cup with the<br/>Princess Elizabeth; from her it passed to the Lady Jane, and then<br/>traversed the general assemblage. &#160;So the banquet began.<br/><br/>By midnight the revelry was at its height. &#160;Now came one of<br/>those picturesque spectacles so admired in that old day. &#160;A<br/>description of it is still extant in the quaint wording of a<br/>chronicler who witnessed it:<br/>
