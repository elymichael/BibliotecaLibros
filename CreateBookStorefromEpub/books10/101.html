<br/>"Who art thou?"<br/><br/>"I am the King," came the answer, with placid simplicity.<br/><br/>"Welcome, King!" cried the hermit, with enthusiasm. &#160;Then,<br/>bustling about with feverish activity, and constantly saying,<br/>"Welcome, welcome," he arranged his bench, seated the King on it,<br/>by the hearth, threw some faggots on the fire, and finally fell to<br/>pacing the floor with a nervous stride.<br/><br/>"Welcome! &#160;Many have sought sanctuary here, but they were<br/>not worthy, and were turned away. &#160;But a King who casts his<br/>crown away, and despises the vain splendours of his office, and<br/>clothes his body in rags, to devote his life to holiness and the<br/>mortification of the flesh—he is worthy, he is welcome!—here shall<br/>he abide all his days till death come." &#160;The King hastened to<br/>interrupt and explain, but the hermit paid no attention to him—did<br/>not even hear him, apparently, but went right on with his talk,<br/>with a raised voice and a growing energy. &#160;"And thou shalt be<br/>at peace here. &#160;None shall find out thy refuge to disquiet<br/>thee with supplications to return to that empty and foolish life<br/>which God hath moved thee to abandon. &#160;Thou shalt pray here;<br/>thou shalt study the Book; thou shalt meditate upon the follies and<br/>delusions of this world, and upon the sublimities of the world to<br/>come; thou shalt feed upon crusts and herbs, and scourge thy body<br/>with whips, daily, to the purifying of thy soul. Thou shalt wear a<br/>hair shirt next thy skin; thou shalt drink water only; and thou<br/>shalt be at peace; yes, wholly at peace; for whoso comes to seek<br/>thee shall go his way again, baffled; he shall not find thee, he<br/>shall not molest thee."<br/><br/>The old man, still pacing back and forth, ceased to speak aloud,<br/>and began to mutter. &#160;The King seized this opportunity to<br/>state his case; and he did it with an eloquence inspired by<br/>uneasiness and apprehension. &#160;But the hermit went on<br/>muttering, and gave no heed. &#160;And still muttering, he<br/>approached the King and said impressively—<br/><br/>"'Sh! &#160;I will tell you a secret!" &#160;He bent down to<br/>impart it, but checked himself, and assumed a listening attitude.<br/>&#160;After a moment or two he went on tiptoe to the<br/>window-opening, put his head out, and peered around in the<br/>gloaming, then came tiptoeing back again, put his face close down<br/>to the King's, and whispered—<br/><br/>"I am an archangel!"<br/><br/>The King started violently, and said to himself, "Would God I<br/>were with the outlaws again; for lo, now am I the prisoner of a<br/>madman!" &#160;His apprehensions were heightened, and they showed<br/>plainly in his face. &#160;In a low excited voice the hermit<br/>continued—<br/><br/>"I see you feel my atmosphere! &#160;There's awe in your face!<br/>&#160;None may be in this atmosphere and not be thus affected; for<br/>it is the very atmosphere of heaven. &#160;I go thither and return,<br/>in the twinkling of an eye. &#160;I was made an archangel on this<br/>very spot, it is five years ago, by angels sent from heaven to<br/>confer that awful dignity. &#160;Their presence filled this place<br/>with an intolerable brightness. &#160;And they knelt to me, King!<br/>yes, they knelt to me! for I was greater than they. &#160;I have<br/>walked in the courts of heaven, and held speech with the<br/>patriarchs. &#160;Touch my hand—be not afraid—touch it.<br/>&#160;There—now thou hast touched a hand which has been clasped by<br/>Abraham and Isaac and Jacob! &#160;For I have walked in the golden<br/>courts; I have seen the Deity face to face!" &#160;He paused, to<br/>give this speech effect; then his face suddenly changed, and he<br/>started to his feet again saying, with angry energy, "Yes, I am an<br/>archangel; A MERE ARCHANGEL!—I that might have been pope! &#160;It<br/>is verily true. &#160;I was told it from heaven in a dream, twenty<br/>years ago; ah, yes, I was to be pope!—and I SHOULD have been pope,<br/>for Heaven had said it—but the King dissolved my religious house,<br/>and I, poor obscure unfriended monk, was cast homeless upon the<br/>world, robbed of my mighty destiny!" Here he began to mumble again,<br/>and beat his forehead in futile rage, with his fist; now and then<br/>articulating a venomous curse, and now and then a pathetic<br/>"Wherefore I am nought but an archangel—I that should have been<br/>pope!"<br/><br/>So he went on, for an hour, whilst the poor little King sat and<br/>suffered. Then all at once the old man's frenzy departed, and he<br/>became all gentleness. &#160;His voice softened, he came down out<br/>of his clouds, and fell to prattling along so simply and so<br/>humanly, that he soon won the King's heart completely. &#160;The<br/>old devotee moved the boy nearer to the fire and made him<br/>comfortable; doctored his small bruises and abrasions with a deft<br/>and tender hand; and then set about preparing and cooking a<br/>supper—chatting pleasantly all the time, and occasionally stroking<br/>the lad's cheek or patting his head, in such a gently caressing way<br/>that in a little while all the fear and repulsion inspired by the<br/>archangel were changed to reverence and affection for the man.<br/><br/>
