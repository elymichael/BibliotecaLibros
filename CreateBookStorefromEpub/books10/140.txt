The sacrifice


Meantime Miles was growing sufficiently tired of confinement and
inaction. &#160;But now his trial came on, to his great
gratification, and he thought he could welcome any sentence
provided a further imprisonment should not be a part of it.
&#160;But he was mistaken about that. &#160;He was in a fine fury
when he found himself described as a 'sturdy vagabond' and
sentenced to sit two hours in the stocks for bearing that character
and for assaulting the master of Hendon Hall. &#160;His pretensions
as to brothership with his prosecutor, and rightful heirship to the
Hendon honours and estates, were left contemptuously unnoticed, as
being not even worth examination.

He raged and threatened on his way to punishment, but it did no
good; he was snatched roughly along by the officers, and got an
occasional cuff, besides, for his irreverent conduct.

The King could not pierce through the rabble that swarmed
behind; so he was obliged to follow in the rear, remote from his
good friend and servant. &#160;The King had been nearly condemned
to the stocks himself for being in such bad company, but had been
let off with a lecture and a warning, in consideration of his
youth. &#160;When the crowd at last halted, he flitted feverishly
from point to point around its outer rim, hunting a place to get
through; and at last, after a deal of difficulty and delay,
succeeded. &#160;There sat his poor henchman in the degrading
stocks, the sport and butt of a dirty mob—he, the body servant of
the King of England! &#160;Edward had heard the sentence
pronounced, but he had not realised the half that it meant.
&#160;His anger began to rise as the sense of this new indignity
which had been put upon him sank home; it jumped to summer heat,
the next moment, when he saw an egg sail through the air and crush
itself against Hendon's cheek, and heard the crowd roar its
enjoyment of the episode. &#160;He sprang across the open circle
and confronted the officer in charge, crying—

"For shame! &#160;This is my servant—set him free! &#160;I am
the—"

"Oh, peace!" exclaimed Hendon, in a panic, "thou'lt destroy
thyself. Mind him not, officer, he is mad."

"Give thyself no trouble as to the matter of minding him, good
man, I have small mind to mind him; but as to teaching him
somewhat, to that I am well inclined." &#160;He turned to a
subordinate and said, "Give the little fool a taste or two of the
lash, to mend his manners."

"Half a dozen will better serve his turn," suggested Sir Hugh,
who had ridden up, a moment before, to take a passing glance at the
proceedings.
