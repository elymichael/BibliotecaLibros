The King was cordially ashamed of himself for having gotten all<br/>that fright and misery out of so paltry a matter as a slumbering<br/>calf; but he need not have felt so about it, for it was not the<br/>calf that frightened him, but a dreadful non-existent something<br/>which the calf stood for; and any other boy, in those old<br/>superstitious times, would have acted and suffered just as he had<br/>done.<br/><br/>The King was not only delighted to find that the creature was<br/>only a calf, but delighted to have the calf's company; for he had<br/>been feeling so lonesome and friendless that the company and<br/>comradeship of even this humble animal were welcome. &#160;And he<br/>had been so buffeted, so rudely entreated by his own kind, that it<br/>was a real comfort to him to feel that he was at last in the<br/>society of a fellow-creature that had at least a soft heart and a<br/>gentle spirit, whatever loftier attributes might be lacking.<br/>&#160;So he resolved to waive rank and make friends with the<br/>calf.<br/><br/>While stroking its sleek warm back—for it lay near him and<br/>within easy reach—it occurred to him that this calf might be<br/>utilised in more ways than one. &#160;Whereupon he re-arranged his<br/>bed, spreading it down close to the calf; then he cuddled himself<br/>up to the calf's back, drew the covers up over himself and his<br/>friend, and in a minute or two was as warm and comfortable as he<br/>had ever been in the downy couches of the regal palace of<br/>Westminster.<br/><br/>Pleasant thoughts came at once; life took on a cheerfuller<br/>seeming. &#160;He was free of the bonds of servitude and crime,<br/>free of the companionship of base and brutal outlaws; he was warm;<br/>he was sheltered; in a word, he was happy. &#160;The night wind was<br/>rising; it swept by in fitful gusts that made the old barn quake<br/>and rattle, then its forces died down at intervals, and went<br/>moaning and wailing around corners and projections—but it was all<br/>music to the King, now that he was snug and comfortable: let it<br/>blow and rage, let it batter and bang, let it moan and wail, he<br/>minded it not, he only enjoyed it. &#160;He merely snuggled the<br/>closer to his friend, in a luxury of warm contentment, and drifted<br/>blissfully out of consciousness into a deep and dreamless sleep<br/>that was full of serenity and peace. &#160;The distant dogs howled,<br/>the melancholy kine complained, and the winds went on raging,<br/>whilst furious sheets of rain drove along the roof; but the Majesty<br/>of England slept on, undisturbed, and the calf did the same, it<br/>being a simple creature, and not easily troubled by storms or<br/>embarrassed by sleeping with a king.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
