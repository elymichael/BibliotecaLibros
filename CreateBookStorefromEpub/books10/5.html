<br/><br/><br/>I will set down a tale as it was told to me by one who<br/>had it of his father, which latter had it of HIS father, this last<br/>having in like manner had it of HIS fatherâ€”and so on, back and<br/>still back, three hundred years and more, the fathers transmitting<br/>it to the sons and so preserving it. &#160;It may be history, it<br/>may be only a legend, a tradition. It may have happened, it may not<br/>have happened: &#160;but it COULD have happened. &#160;It may be<br/>that the wise and the learned believed it in the old days; it may<br/>be that only the unlearned and the simple loved it and credited<br/>it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>
