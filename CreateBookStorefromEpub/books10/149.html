'twas she that hath disturbed<br/>your Highness."<br/><br/>The gorgeous figure turned a lustreless eye upon the Duke, and<br/>said in a dead voiceâ€”<br/><br/>"She was my mother!"<br/><br/>"My God!" groaned the Protector as he reined his horse backward<br/>to his post, "the omen was pregnant with prophecy. &#160;He is gone<br/>mad again!"<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
