<br/>"Now," said Canty, "to bed, all of ye. &#160;The entertainment<br/>has tired me."<br/><br/>The light was put out, and the family retired. &#160;As soon as<br/>the snorings of the head of the house and his mother showed that<br/>they were asleep, the young girls crept to where the Prince lay,<br/>and covered him tenderly from the cold with straw and rags; and<br/>their mother crept to him also, and stroked his hair, and cried<br/>over him, whispering broken words of comfort and compassion in his<br/>ear the while. &#160;She had saved a morsel for him to eat, also;<br/>but the boy's pains had swept away all appetite—at least for black<br/>and tasteless crusts. &#160;He was touched by her brave and costly<br/>defence of him, and by her commiseration; and he thanked her in<br/>very noble and princely words, and begged her to go to her sleep<br/>and try to forget her sorrows. &#160;And he added that the King his<br/>father would not let her loyal kindness and devotion go unrewarded.<br/>&#160;This return to his 'madness' broke her heart anew, and she<br/>strained him to her breast again and again, and then went back,<br/>drowned in tears, to her bed.<br/><br/>As she lay thinking and mourning, the suggestion began to creep<br/>into her mind that there was an undefinable something about this<br/>boy that was lacking in Tom Canty, mad or sane. &#160;She could not<br/>describe it, she could not tell just what it was, and yet her sharp<br/>mother-instinct seemed to detect it and perceive it. &#160;What if<br/>the boy were really not her son, after all? &#160;Oh, absurd!<br/>&#160;She almost smiled at the idea, spite of her griefs and<br/>troubles. &#160;No matter, she found that it was an idea that would<br/>not 'down,' but persisted in haunting her. &#160;It pursued her, it<br/>harassed her, it clung to her, and refused to be put away or<br/>ignored. &#160;At last she perceived that there was not going to be<br/>any peace for her until she should devise a test that should prove,<br/>clearly and without question, whether this lad was her son or not,<br/>and so banish these wearing and worrying doubts. &#160;Ah, yes,<br/>this was plainly the right way out of the difficulty; therefore she<br/>set her wits to work at once to contrive that test. &#160;But it<br/>was an easier thing to propose than to accomplish. &#160;She turned<br/>over in her mind one promising test after another, but was obliged<br/>to relinquish them all—none of them were absolutely sure,<br/>absolutely perfect; and an imperfect one could not satisfy her.<br/>&#160;Evidently she was racking her head in vain—it seemed manifest<br/>that she must give the matter up. &#160;While this depressing<br/>thought was passing through her mind, her ear caught the regular<br/>breathing of the boy, and she knew he had fallen asleep. &#160;And<br/>while she listened, the measured breathing was broken by a soft,<br/>startled cry, such as one utters in a troubled dream. &#160;This<br/>chance occurrence furnished her instantly with a plan worth all her<br/>laboured tests combined. &#160;She at once set herself feverishly,<br/>but noiselessly, to work to relight her candle, muttering to<br/>herself, "Had I but seen him THEN, I should have known! &#160;Since<br/>that day, when he was little, that the powder burst in his face, he<br/>hath never been startled of a sudden out of his dreams or out of<br/>his thinkings, but he hath cast his hand before his eyes, even as<br/>he did that day; and not as others would do it, with the palm<br/>inward, but always with the palm turned outward—I have seen it a<br/>hundred times, and it hath never varied nor ever failed. &#160;Yes,<br/>I shall soon know, now!"<br/><br/>By this time she had crept to the slumbering boy's side, with<br/>the candle, shaded, in her hand. &#160;She bent heedfully and<br/>warily over him, scarcely breathing in her suppressed excitement,<br/>and suddenly flashed the light in his face and struck the floor by<br/>his ear with her knuckles. &#160;The sleeper's eyes sprang wide<br/>open, and he cast a startled stare about him—but he made no special<br/>movement with his hands.<br/><br/>The poor woman was smitten almost helpless with surprise and<br/>grief; but she contrived to hide her emotions, and to soothe the<br/>boy to sleep again; then she crept apart and communed miserably<br/>with herself upon the disastrous result of her experiment.<br/>&#160;She tried to believe that her Tom's madness had banished this<br/>habitual gesture of his; but she could not do it. &#160;"No," she<br/>said, "his HANDS are not mad; they could not unlearn so old a habit<br/>in so brief a time. &#160;Oh, this is a heavy day for me!"<br/><br/>Still, hope was as stubborn now as doubt had been before; she<br/>could not bring herself to accept the verdict of the test; she must<br/>try the thing again—the failure must have been only an accident; so<br/>she startled the boy out of his sleep a second and a third time, at<br/>intervals—with the same result which had marked the first test;<br/>then she dragged herself to bed, and fell sorrowfully asleep,<br/>saying, "But I cannot give him up—oh no, I cannot, I cannot—he MUST<br/>be my boy!"<br/><br/>The poor mother's interruptions having ceased, and the Prince's<br/>pains having gradually lost their power to disturb him, utter<br/>weariness at last sealed his eyes in a profound and restful sleep.<br/>Hour after hour slipped away, and still he slept like the dead.<br/>Thus four or five hours passed. Then his stupor began to lighten.<br/>Presently, while half asleep and half awake, he murmured—<br/><br/>"Sir William!"<br/><br/>After a moment—<br/><br/>"Ho, Sir William Herbert! &#160;Hie thee hither, and list to the<br/>strangest dream that ever&#160;… Sir William! dost hear? &#160;Man,<br/>I did think me changed to a pauper, and&#160;… Ho there!<br/>&#160;Guards! Sir William! &#160;What! is there no groom of the<br/>chamber in waiting? Alack! it shall go hard with—"<br/><br/>
