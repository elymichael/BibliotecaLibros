"It enrageth me that a man should be hanged upon such idle,<br/>hare-brained evidence!"<br/><br/>A low buzz of admiration swept through the assemblage. &#160;It<br/>was not admiration of the decree that had been delivered by Tom,<br/>for the propriety or expediency of pardoning a convicted poisoner<br/>was a thing which few there would have felt justified in either<br/>admitting or admiring—no, the admiration was for the intelligence<br/>and spirit which Tom had displayed. &#160;Some of the low-voiced<br/>remarks were to this effect—<br/><br/>"This is no mad king—he hath his wits sound."<br/><br/>"How sanely he put his questions—how like his former natural<br/>self was this abrupt imperious disposal of the matter!"<br/><br/>"God be thanked, his infirmity is spent! &#160;This is no<br/>weakling, but a king. &#160;He hath borne himself like to his own<br/>father."<br/><br/>The air being filled with applause, Tom's ear necessarily caught<br/>a little of it. &#160;The effect which this had upon him was to put<br/>him greatly at his ease, and also to charge his system with very<br/>gratifying sensations.<br/><br/>However, his juvenile curiosity soon rose superior to these<br/>pleasant thoughts and feelings; he was eager to know what sort of<br/>deadly mischief the woman and the little girl could have been<br/>about; so, by his command, the two terrified and sobbing creatures<br/>were brought before him.<br/><br/>"What is it that these have done?" he inquired of the<br/>sheriff.<br/><br/>"Please your Majesty, a black crime is charged upon them, and<br/>clearly proven; wherefore the judges have decreed, according to the<br/>law, that they be hanged. &#160;They sold themselves to the<br/>devil—such is their crime."<br/><br/>Tom shuddered. &#160;He had been taught to abhor people who did<br/>this wicked thing. &#160;Still, he was not going to deny himself<br/>the pleasure of feeding his curiosity for all that; so he<br/>asked—<br/><br/>"Where was this done?—and when?"<br/>
