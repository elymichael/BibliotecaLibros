A great gate swung open, and a crowd of citizens poured in.<br/>&#160;They flocked around the two women, and hid them from the<br/>King's view. A clergyman entered and passed through the crowd, and<br/>he also was hidden. &#160;The King now heard talking, back and<br/>forth, as if questions were being asked and answered, but he could<br/>not make out what was said. &#160;Next there was a deal of bustle<br/>and preparation, and much passing and repassing of officials<br/>through that part of the crowd that stood on the further side of<br/>the women; and whilst this proceeded a deep hush gradually fell<br/>upon the people.<br/><br/>Now, by command, the masses parted and fell aside, and the King<br/>saw a spectacle that froze the marrow in his bones. &#160;Faggots<br/>had been piled about the two women, and a kneeling man was lighting<br/>them!<br/><br/>The women bowed their heads, and covered their faces with their<br/>hands; the yellow flames began to climb upward among the snapping<br/>and crackling faggots, and wreaths of blue smoke to stream away on<br/>the wind; the clergyman lifted his hands and began a prayer—just<br/>then two young girls came flying through the great gate, uttering<br/>piercing screams, and threw themselves upon the women at the stake.<br/>&#160;Instantly they were torn away by the officers, and one of<br/>them was kept in a tight grip, but the other broke loose, saying<br/>she would die with her mother; and before she could be stopped she<br/>had flung her arms about her mother's neck again. &#160;She was<br/>torn away once more, and with her gown on fire. &#160;Two or three<br/>men held her, and the burning portion of her gown was snatched off<br/>and thrown flaming aside, she struggling all the while to free<br/>herself, and saying she would be alone in the world, now; and<br/>begging to be allowed to die with her mother. &#160;Both the girls<br/>screamed continually, and fought for freedom; but suddenly this<br/>tumult was drowned under a volley of heart-piercing shrieks of<br/>mortal agony—the King glanced from the frantic girls to the stake,<br/>then turned away and leaned his ashen face against the wall, and<br/>looked no more. &#160;He said, "That which I have seen, in that one<br/>little moment, will never go out from my memory, but will abide<br/>there; and I shall see it all the days, and dream of it all the<br/>nights, till I die. &#160;Would God I had been blind!"<br/><br/>Hendon was watching the King. &#160;He said to himself,<br/>with satisfaction, "His disorder mendeth; he hath changed, and<br/>groweth gentler. &#160;If he had followed his wont, he would have<br/>stormed at these varlets, and said he was King, and commanded that<br/>the women be turned loose unscathed. &#160;Soon his delusion will<br/>pass away and be forgotten, and his poor mind will be whole again.<br/>&#160;God speed the day!"<br/><br/>That same day several prisoners were brought in to remain over<br/>night, who were being conveyed, under guard, to various places in<br/>the kingdom, to undergo punishment for crimes committed. &#160;The<br/>King conversed with these—he had made it a point, from the<br/>beginning, to instruct himself for the kingly office by questioning<br/>prisoners whenever the opportunity offered—and the tale of their<br/>woes wrung his heart. &#160;One of them was a poor half-witted<br/>woman who had stolen a yard or two of cloth from a weaver—she was<br/>to be hanged for it. &#160;Another was a man who had been accused<br/>of stealing a horse; he said the proof had failed, and he had<br/>imagined that he was safe from the halter; but no—he was hardly<br/>free before he was arraigned for killing a deer in the King's park;<br/>this was proved against him, and now he was on his way to the<br/>gallows. &#160;There was a tradesman's apprentice whose case<br/>particularly distressed the King; this youth said he found a hawk,<br/>one evening, that had escaped from its owner, and he took it home<br/>with him, imagining himself entitled to it; but the court convicted<br/>him of stealing it, and sentenced him to death.<br/><br/>The King was furious over these inhumanities, and wanted Hendon<br/>to break jail and fly with him to Westminster, so that he could<br/>mount his throne and hold out his sceptre in mercy over these<br/>unfortunate people and save their lives. &#160;"Poor child," sighed<br/>Hendon, "these woeful tales have brought his malady upon him again;<br/>alack, but for this evil hap, he would have been well in a little<br/>time."<br/><br/>Among these prisoners was an old lawyer—a man with a strong face<br/>and a dauntless mien. &#160;Three years past, he had written a<br/>pamphlet against the Lord Chancellor, accusing him of injustice,<br/>and had been punished for it by the loss of his ears in the<br/>pillory, and degradation from the bar, and in addition had been<br/>fined 3,000 pounds and sentenced to imprisonment for life.<br/>&#160;Lately he had repeated his offence; and in consequence was<br/>now under sentence to lose WHAT REMAINED OF HIS EARS, pay a fine of<br/>5,000 pounds, be branded on both cheeks, and remain in prison for<br/>life.<br/><br/>"These be honourable scars," he said, and turned back his grey<br/>hair and showed the mutilated stubs of what had once been his<br/>ears.<br/><br/>The King's eye burned with passion. &#160;He said—<br/><br/>"None believe in me—neither wilt thou. &#160;But no<br/>matter—within the compass of a month thou shalt be free; and more,<br/>the laws that have dishonoured thee, and shamed the English name,<br/>shall be swept from the statute books. &#160;The world is made<br/>wrong; kings should go to school to their own laws, at times, and<br/>so learn mercy."<br/><br/><br/>
