<br/>He dropped asleep as the dawn appeared. &#160;Toward noon he<br/>rose, uncovered his unconscious ward—a section at a time—and took<br/>his measure with a string. &#160;The King awoke, just as he had<br/>completed his work, complained of the cold, and asked what he was<br/>doing.<br/><br/>"'Tis done, now, my liege," said Hendon; "I have a bit of<br/>business outside, but will presently return; sleep thou again—thou<br/>needest it. There—let me cover thy head also—thou'lt be warm the<br/>sooner."<br/><br/>The King was back in dreamland before this speech was ended.<br/>Miles slipped softly out, and slipped as softly in again, in the<br/>course of thirty or forty minutes, with a complete second-hand suit<br/>of boy's clothing, of cheap material, and showing signs of wear;<br/>but tidy, and suited to the season of the year. &#160;He seated<br/>himself, and began to overhaul his purchase, mumbling to<br/>himself—<br/><br/>"A longer purse would have got a better sort, but when one has<br/>not the long purse one must be content with what a short one may<br/>do—<br/><br/><br/>"'There was a woman in our town,&#160;<br/>In our town did dwell—'<br/><br/><br/>"He stirred, methinks—I must sing in a less thunderous key; 'tis<br/>not good to mar his sleep, with this journey before him, and he so<br/>wearied out, poor chap&#160;… This garment—'tis well enough—a<br/>stitch here and another one there will set it aright. &#160;This<br/>other is better, albeit a stitch or two will not come amiss in it,<br/>likewise&#160;… THESE be very good and sound, and will keep his<br/>small feet warm and dry—an odd new thing to him, belike, since he<br/>has doubtless been used to foot it bare, winters and summers the<br/>same&#160;… Would thread were bread, seeing one getteth a year's<br/>sufficiency for a farthing, and such a brave big needle without<br/>cost, for mere love. &#160;Now shall I have the demon's own time to<br/>thread it!"<br/><br/>And so he had. &#160;He did as men have always done, and<br/>probably always will do, to the end of time—held the needle still,<br/>and tried to thrust the thread through the eye, which is the<br/>opposite of a woman's way. &#160;Time and time again the thread<br/>missed the mark, going sometimes on one side of the needle,<br/>sometimes on the other, sometimes doubling up against the shaft;<br/>but he was patient, having been through these experiences before,<br/>when he was soldiering. &#160;He succeeded at last, and took up the<br/>garment that had lain waiting, meantime, across his lap, and began<br/>his work.<br/><br/>"The inn is paid—the breakfast that is to come, included—and<br/>there is wherewithal left to buy a couple of donkeys and meet our<br/>little costs for the two or three days betwixt this and the plenty<br/>that awaits us at Hendon Hall—<br/><br/><br/>
