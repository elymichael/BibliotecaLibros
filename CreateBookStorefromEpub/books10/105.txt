The dawn was coming now; the hermit observed it, and spoke up
sharply, with a touch of nervous apprehension in his voice—

"I may not indulge this ecstasy longer! &#160;The night is
already gone. &#160;It seems but a moment—only a moment; would it
had endured a year! &#160;Seed of the Church's spoiler, close thy
perishing eyes, an' thou fearest to look upon—"

The rest was lost in inarticulate mutterings. &#160;The old man
sank upon his knees, his knife in his hand, and bent himself over
the moaning boy.

Hark! &#160;There was a sound of voices near the cabin—the knife
dropped from the hermit's hand; he cast a sheepskin over the boy
and started up, trembling. &#160;The sounds increased, and
presently the voices became rough and angry; then came blows, and
cries for help; then a clatter of swift footsteps, retreating.
&#160;Immediately came a succession of thundering knocks upon the
cabin door, followed by—

"Hullo-o-o! &#160;Open! &#160;And despatch, in the name of all
the devils!"

Oh, this was the blessedest sound that had ever made music in
the King's ears; for it was Miles Hendon's voice!

The hermit, grinding his teeth in impotent rage, moved swiftly
out of the bedchamber, closing the door behind him; and straightway
the King heard a talk, to this effect, proceeding from the
'chapel':—

"Homage and greeting, reverend sir! &#160;Where is the boy—MY
boy?"

"What boy, friend?"

"What boy! &#160;Lie me no lies, sir priest, play me no
deceptions!—I am not in the humour for it. &#160;Near to this place
I caught the scoundrels who I judged did steal him from me, and I
made them confess; they said he was at large again, and they had
tracked him to your door. &#160;They showed me his very footprints.
&#160;Now palter no more; for look you, holy sir, an' thou produce
him not—Where is the boy?"
