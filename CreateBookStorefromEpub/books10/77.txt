"On a midnight in December, in a ruined church, your
Majesty."

Tom shuddered again.

"Who was there present?"

"Only these two, your grace—and THAT OTHER."

"Have these confessed?"

"Nay, not so, sire—they do deny it."

"Then prithee, how was it known?"

"Certain witness did see them wending thither, good your
Majesty; this bred the suspicion, and dire effects have since
confirmed and justified it. &#160;In particular, it is in evidence
that through the wicked power so obtained, they did invoke and
bring about a storm that wasted all the region round about.
&#160;Above forty witnesses have proved the storm; and sooth one
might have had a thousand, for all had reason to remember it, sith
all had suffered by it."

"Certes this is a serious matter." &#160;Tom turned this dark
piece of scoundrelism over in his mind a while, then asked—

"Suffered the woman also by the storm?"
