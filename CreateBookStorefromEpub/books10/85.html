Hobbs and Hugo fell to talking together, in low voices, and the<br/>King removed himself as far as he could from their disagreeable<br/>company. &#160;He withdrew into the twilight of the farther end of<br/>the barn, where he found the earthen floor bedded a foot deep with<br/>straw. &#160;He lay down here, drew straw over himself in lieu of<br/>blankets, and was soon absorbed in thinking. &#160;He had many<br/>griefs, but the minor ones were swept almost into forgetfulness by<br/>the supreme one, the loss of his father. &#160;To the rest of the<br/>world the name of Henry VIII. brought a shiver, and suggested an<br/>ogre whose nostrils breathed destruction and whose hand dealt<br/>scourgings and death; but to this boy the name brought only<br/>sensations of pleasure; the figure it invoked wore a countenance<br/>that was all gentleness and affection. &#160;He called to mind a<br/>long succession of loving passages between his father and himself,<br/>and dwelt fondly upon them, his unstinted tears attesting how deep<br/>and real was the grief that possessed his heart. As the afternoon<br/>wasted away, the lad, wearied with his troubles, sank gradually<br/>into a tranquil and healing slumber.<br/><br/>After a considerable time—he could not tell how long—his senses<br/>struggled to a half-consciousness, and as he lay with closed eyes<br/>vaguely wondering where he was and what had been happening, he<br/>noted a murmurous sound, the sullen beating of rain upon the roof.<br/>A snug sense of comfort stole over him, which was rudely broken,<br/>the next moment, by a chorus of piping cackles and coarse laughter.<br/>&#160;It startled him disagreeably, and he unmuffled his head to<br/>see whence this interruption proceeded. &#160;A grim and unsightly<br/>picture met his eye. &#160;A bright fire was burning in the middle<br/>of the floor, at the other end of the barn; and around it, and lit<br/>weirdly up by the red glare, lolled and sprawled the motliest<br/>company of tattered gutter-scum and ruffians, of both sexes, he had<br/>ever read or dreamed of. &#160;There were huge stalwart men, brown<br/>with exposure, long-haired, and clothed in fantastic rags; there<br/>were middle-sized youths, of truculent countenance, and similarly<br/>clad; there were blind mendicants, with patched or bandaged eyes;<br/>crippled ones, with wooden legs and crutches; diseased ones, with<br/>running sores peeping from ineffectual wrappings; there was a<br/>villain-looking pedlar with his pack; a knife-grinder, a tinker,<br/>and a barber-surgeon, with the implements of their trades; some of<br/>the females were hardly-grown girls, some were at prime, some were<br/>old and wrinkled hags, and all were loud, brazen, foul-mouthed; and<br/>all soiled and slatternly; there were three sore-faced babies;<br/>there were a couple of starveling curs, with strings about their<br/>necks, whose office was to lead the blind.<br/><br/>The night was come, the gang had just finished feasting, an orgy<br/>was beginning; the can of liquor was passing from mouth to mouth. A<br/>general cry broke forth—<br/><br/>"A song! a song from the Bat and Dick and Dot-and-go-One!"<br/><br/>One of the blind men got up, and made ready by casting aside the<br/>patches that sheltered his excellent eyes, and the pathetic placard<br/>which recited the cause of his calamity. &#160;Dot-and-go-One<br/>disencumbered himself of his timber leg and took his place, upon<br/>sound and healthy limbs, beside his fellow-rascal; then they roared<br/>out a rollicking ditty, and were reinforced by the whole crew, at<br/>the end of each stanza, in a rousing chorus. &#160;By the time the<br/>last stanza was reached, the half-drunken enthusiasm had risen to<br/>such a pitch, that everybody joined in and sang it clear through<br/>from the beginning, producing a volume of villainous sound that<br/>made the rafters quake. &#160;These were the inspiring words:—<br/><br/><br/>'Bien Darkman's then, Bouse Mort and Ken,<br/>The bien Coves bings awast,<br/>On Chates to trine by Rome Coves dine<br/>For his long lib at last.<br/>Bing'd out bien Morts and toure, and toure,<br/>Bing out of the Rome vile bine,<br/>And toure the Cove that cloy'd your duds,<br/>Upon the Chates to trine.'<br/><br/>(From'The English Rogue.' London, 1665.)<br/>
