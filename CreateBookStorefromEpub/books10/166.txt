General note


One hears much about the 'hideous Blue Laws of Connecticut,' and
is accustomed to shudder piously when they are mentioned.
&#160;There are people in America—and even in England!—who imagine
that they were a very monument of malignity, pitilessness, and
inhumanity; whereas in reality they were about the first SWEEPING
DEPARTURE FROM JUDICIAL ATROCITY which the 'civilised' world had
seen. &#160;This humane and kindly Blue Law Code, of two hundred
and forty years ago, stands all by itself, with ages of bloody law
on the further side of it, and a century and three-quarters of
bloody English law on THIS side of it.

There has never been a time—under the Blue Laws or any
other—when above FOURTEEN crimes were punishable by death in
Connecticut. &#160;But in England, within the memory of men who are
still hale in body and mind, TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY-THREE crimes
were punishable by death! &#160;These facts are worth knowing—and
worth thinking about, too.
