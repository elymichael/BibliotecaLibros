<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>5<br/>Tom as a patrician<br/><br/><br/>Tom Canty, left alone in the prince's cabinet, made good use of<br/>his opportunity. &#160;He turned himself this way and that before<br/>the great mirror, admiring his finery; then walked away, imitating<br/>the prince's high-bred carriage, and still observing results in the<br/>glass. &#160;Next he drew the beautiful sword, and bowed, kissing<br/>the blade, and laying it across his breast, as he had seen a noble<br/>knight do, by way of salute to the lieutenant of the Tower, five or<br/>six weeks before, when delivering the great lords of Norfolk and<br/>Surrey into his hands for captivity. &#160;Tom played with the<br/>jewelled dagger that hung upon his thigh; he examined the costly<br/>and exquisite ornaments of the room; he tried each of the sumptuous<br/>chairs, and thought how proud he would be if the Offal Court herd<br/>could only peep in and see him in his grandeur. &#160;He wondered<br/>if they would believe the marvellous tale he should tell when he<br/>got home, or if they would shake their heads, and say his overtaxed<br/>imagination had at last upset his reason.<br/><br/>At the end of half an hour it suddenly occurred to him that the<br/>prince was gone a long time; then right away he began to feel<br/>lonely; very soon he fell to listening and longing, and ceased to<br/>toy with the pretty things about him; he grew uneasy, then<br/>restless, then distressed. Suppose some one should come, and catch<br/>him in the prince's clothes, and the prince not there to explain.<br/>&#160;Might they not hang him at once, and inquire into his case<br/>afterward? &#160;He had heard that the great were prompt about<br/>small matters. &#160;His fear rose higher and higher; and trembling<br/>he softly opened the door to the antechamber, resolved to fly and<br/>seek the prince, and, through him, protection and release.<br/>&#160;Six gorgeous gentlemen-servants and two young pages of high<br/>degree, clothed like butterflies, sprang to their feet and bowed<br/>low before him. &#160;He stepped quickly back and shut the door.<br/>&#160;He said—<br/><br/>"Oh, they mock at me! &#160;They will go and tell. &#160;Oh! why<br/>came I here to cast away my life?"<br/><br/>He walked up and down the floor, filled with nameless fears,<br/>listening, starting at every trifling sound. &#160;Presently the<br/>door swung open, and a silken page said—<br/><br/>"The Lady Jane Grey."<br/><br/>The door closed and a sweet young girl, richly clad, bounded<br/>toward him. But she stopped suddenly, and said in a distressed<br/>voice—<br/><br/>"Oh, what aileth thee, my lord?"<br/>
