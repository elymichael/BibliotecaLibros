<br/>"Not too fast, friend. &#160;Thou art needlessly rough,<br/>methinks. &#160;What is the lad to thee?"<br/><br/>"If it be any business of thine to make and meddle in others'<br/>affairs, he is my son."<br/><br/>"'Tis a lie!" cried the little King, hotly.<br/><br/>"Boldly said, and I believe thee, whether thy small headpiece be<br/>sound or cracked, my boy. &#160;But whether this scurvy ruffian be<br/>thy father or no, 'tis all one, he shall not have thee to beat thee<br/>and abuse, according to his threat, so thou prefer to bide with<br/>me."<br/><br/>"I do, I do—I know him not, I loathe him, and will die before I<br/>will go with him."<br/><br/>"Then 'tis settled, and there is nought more to say."<br/><br/>"We will see, as to that!" exclaimed John Canty, striding past<br/>Hendon to get at the boy; "by force shall he—"<br/><br/>"If thou do but touch him, thou animated offal, I will spit thee<br/>like a goose!" said Hendon, barring the way and laying his hand<br/>upon his sword hilt. &#160;Canty drew back. &#160;"Now mark ye,"<br/>continued Hendon, "I took this lad under my protection when a mob<br/>of such as thou would have mishandled him, mayhap killed him; dost<br/>imagine I will desert him now to a worser fate?—for whether thou<br/>art his father or no—and sooth to say, I think it is a lie—a decent<br/>swift death were better for such a lad than life in such brute<br/>hands as thine. &#160;So go thy ways, and set quick about it, for I<br/>like not much bandying of words, being not over-patient in my<br/>nature."<br/><br/>John Canty moved off, muttering threats and curses, and was<br/>swallowed from sight in the crowd. &#160;Hendon ascended three<br/>flights of stairs to his room, with his charge, after ordering a<br/>meal to be sent thither. &#160;It was a poor apartment, with a<br/>shabby bed and some odds and ends of old furniture in it, and was<br/>vaguely lighted by a couple of sickly candles. The little King<br/>dragged himself to the bed and lay down upon it, almost exhausted<br/>with hunger and fatigue. &#160;He had been on his feet a good part<br/>of a day and a night (for it was now two or three o'clock in the<br/>morning), and had eaten nothing meantime. &#160;He murmured<br/>drowsily—<br/><br/>"Prithee call me when the table is spread," and sank into a deep<br/>sleep immediately.<br/><br/>
