<br/>"What's amiss?"<br/><br/>"Good sir, I would wash me."<br/><br/>"Oh, is that all? &#160;Ask no permission of Miles Hendon for<br/>aught thou cravest. &#160;Make thyself perfectly free here, and<br/>welcome, with all that are his belongings."<br/><br/>Still the boy stood, and moved not; more, he tapped the floor<br/>once or twice with his small impatient foot. &#160;Hendon was<br/>wholly perplexed. &#160;Said he—<br/><br/>"Bless us, what is it?"<br/><br/>"Prithee pour the water, and make not so many words!"<br/><br/>Hendon, suppressing a horse-laugh, and saying to himself, "By<br/>all the saints, but this is admirable!" stepped briskly forward and<br/>did the small insolent's bidding; then stood by, in a sort of<br/>stupefaction, until the command, "Come—the towel!" woke him sharply<br/>up. &#160;He took up a towel, from under the boy's nose, and handed<br/>it to him without comment. &#160;He now proceeded to comfort his<br/>own face with a wash, and while he was at it his adopted child<br/>seated himself at the table and prepared to fall to. Hendon<br/>despatched his ablutions with alacrity, then drew back the other<br/>chair and was about to place himself at table, when the boy said,<br/>indignantly—<br/><br/>"Forbear! &#160;Wouldst sit in the presence of the King?"<br/><br/>This blow staggered Hendon to his foundations. &#160;He muttered<br/>to himself, "Lo, the poor thing's madness is up with the time!<br/>&#160;It hath changed with the great change that is come to the<br/>realm, and now in fancy is he KING! Good lack, I must humour the<br/>conceit, too—there is no other way—faith, he would order me to the<br/>Tower, else!"<br/><br/>And pleased with this jest, he removed the chair from the table,<br/>took his stand behind the King, and proceeded to wait upon him in<br/>the courtliest way he was capable of.<br/><br/>
