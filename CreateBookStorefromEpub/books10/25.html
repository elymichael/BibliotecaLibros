Then he asked Tom a question in Latin, and Tom answered him<br/>lamely in the same tongue. &#160;The lords and doctors manifested<br/>their gratification also. The King said—<br/><br/>"'Twas not according to his schooling and ability, but showeth<br/>that his mind is but diseased, not stricken fatally. &#160;How say<br/>you, sir?"<br/><br/>The physician addressed bowed low, and replied—<br/><br/>"It jumpeth with my own conviction, sire, that thou hast divined<br/>aright."<br/><br/>The King looked pleased with this encouragement, coming as it<br/>did from so excellent authority, and continued with good heart—<br/><br/>"Now mark ye all: &#160;we will try him further."<br/><br/>He put a question to Tom in French. &#160;Tom stood silent a<br/>moment, embarrassed by having so many eyes centred upon him, then<br/>said diffidently—<br/><br/>"I have no knowledge of this tongue, so please your<br/>majesty."<br/><br/>The King fell back upon his couch. &#160;The attendants flew to<br/>his assistance; but he put them aside, and said—<br/><br/>"Trouble me not—it is nothing but a scurvy faintness.<br/>&#160;Raise me! There, 'tis sufficient. &#160;Come hither, child;<br/>there, rest thy poor troubled head upon thy father's heart, and be<br/>at peace. &#160;Thou'lt soon be well: &#160;'tis but a passing<br/>fantasy. &#160;Fear thou not; thou'lt soon be well." &#160;Then he<br/>turned toward the company: &#160;his gentle manner changed, and<br/>baleful lightnings began to play from his eyes. &#160;He said—<br/><br/>"List ye all! &#160;This my son is mad; but it is not permanent.<br/>&#160;Over-study hath done this, and somewhat too much of<br/>confinement. &#160;Away with his books and teachers! see ye to it.<br/>&#160;Pleasure him with sports, beguile him in wholesome ways, so<br/>that his health come again." &#160;He raised himself higher still,<br/>and went on with energy, "He is mad; but he is my son, and<br/>England's heir; and, mad or sane, still shall he reign! &#160;And<br/>hear ye further, and proclaim it: whoso speaketh of this his<br/>distemper worketh against the peace and order of these realms, and<br/>shall to the gallows!&#160;… Give me to drink—I burn: &#160;this<br/>sorrow sappeth my strength… . There, take away the cup… . Support<br/>me. &#160;There, that is well. &#160;Mad, is he? &#160;Were he a<br/>thousand times mad, yet is he Prince of Wales, and I the King will<br/>confirm it. &#160;This very morrow shall he be installed in his<br/>princely dignity in due and ancient form. &#160;Take instant order<br/>for it, my lord Hertford."<br/>
