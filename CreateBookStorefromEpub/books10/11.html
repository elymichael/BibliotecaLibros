"Offal Court! &#160;Truly 'tis another odd one. &#160;Hast<br/>parents?"<br/><br/>"Parents have I, sir, and a grand-dam likewise that is but<br/>indifferently precious to me, God forgive me if it be offence to<br/>say it—also twin sisters, Nan and Bet."<br/><br/>"Then is thy grand-dam not over kind to thee, I take it?"<br/><br/>"Neither to any other is she, so please your worship. &#160;She<br/>hath a wicked heart, and worketh evil all her days."<br/><br/>"Doth she mistreat thee?"<br/><br/>"There be times that she stayeth her hand, being asleep or<br/>overcome with drink; but when she hath her judgment clear again,<br/>she maketh it up to me with goodly beatings."<br/><br/>A fierce look came into the little prince's eyes, and he cried<br/>out—<br/><br/>"What! &#160;Beatings?"<br/><br/>"Oh, indeed, yes, please you, sir."<br/><br/>"BEATINGS!—and thou so frail and little. &#160;Hark ye:<br/>&#160;before the night come, she shall hie her to the Tower.<br/>&#160;The King my father"—<br/><br/>"In sooth, you forget, sir, her low degree. &#160;The Tower is<br/>for the great alone."<br/>
