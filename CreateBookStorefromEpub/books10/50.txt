The great assemblage bent their heads upon their breasts with
one accord; remained so, in profound silence, a few moments; then
all sank upon their knees in a body, stretched out their hands
toward Tom, and a mighty shout burst forth that seemed to shake the
building—

"Long live the King!"

Poor Tom's dazed eyes wandered abroad over this stupefying
spectacle, and finally rested dreamily upon the kneeling princesses
beside him, a moment, then upon the Earl of Hertford. A sudden
purpose dawned in his face. &#160;He said, in a low tone, at Lord
Hertford's ear—

"Answer me truly, on thy faith and honour! &#160;Uttered I here
a command, the which none but a king might hold privilege and
prerogative to utter, would such commandment be obeyed, and none
rise up to say me nay?"

"None, my liege, in all these realms. &#160;In thy person bides
the majesty of England. &#160;Thou art the king—thy word is
law."

Tom responded, in a strong, earnest voice, and with great
animation—

"Then shall the king's law be law of mercy, from this day, and
never more be law of blood! &#160;Up from thy knees and away!
&#160;To the Tower, and say the King decrees the Duke of Norfolk
shall not die!"

The words were caught up and carried eagerly from lip to lip far
and wide over the hall, and as Hertford hurried from the presence,
another prodigious shout burst forth—

"The reign of blood is ended! &#160;Long live Edward, King of
England!"
