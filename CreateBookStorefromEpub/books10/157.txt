The red blood began to steal up into Tom's cheeks, and he
dropped his eyes and was silent.

"Speak up, good lad, and fear nothing," said the King.
&#160;"How used you the Great Seal of England?"

Tom stammered a moment, in a pathetic confusion, then got it
outâ€”

"To crack nuts with!"

Poor child, the avalanche of laughter that greeted this
nearly swept him off his feet. &#160;But if a doubt remained in any
mind that Tom Canty was not the King of England and familiar with
the august appurtenances of royalty, this reply disposed of it
utterly.

Meantime the sumptuous robe of state had been removed from Tom's
shoulders to the King's, whose rags were effectually hidden from
sight under it. &#160;Then the coronation ceremonies were resumed;
the true King was anointed and the crown set upon his head, whilst
cannon thundered the news to the city, and all London seemed to
rock with applause.
