"It grieveth me, my lord the King, to bear so heavy and<br/>unwelcome tidings; but it is the will of God that the prince's<br/>affliction abideth still, and he cannot recall to mind that he<br/>received the Seal. &#160;So came I quickly to report, thinking it<br/>were waste of precious time, and little worth withal, that any<br/>should attempt to search the long array of chambers and saloons<br/>that belong unto his royal high—"<br/><br/>A groan from the King interrupted the lord at this point.<br/>&#160;After a little while his majesty said, with a deep sadness in<br/>his tone—<br/><br/>"Trouble him no more, poor child. &#160;The hand of God lieth<br/>heavy upon him, and my heart goeth out in loving compassion for<br/>him, and sorrow that I may not bear his burden on mine old<br/>trouble-weighted shoulders, and so bring him peace."<br/><br/>He closed his eyes, fell to mumbling, and presently was silent.<br/>After a time he opened his eyes again, and gazed vacantly around<br/>until his glance rested upon the kneeling Lord Chancellor.<br/>Instantly his face flushed with wrath—<br/><br/>"What, thou here yet! &#160;By the glory of God, an' thou<br/>gettest not about that traitor's business, thy mitre shall have<br/>holiday the morrow for lack of a head to grace withal!"<br/><br/>The trembling Chancellor answered—<br/><br/>"Good your Majesty, I cry you mercy! &#160;I but waited for the<br/>Seal."<br/><br/>"Man, hast lost thy wits? &#160;The small Seal which aforetime I<br/>was wont to take with me abroad lieth in my treasury. &#160;And,<br/>since the Great Seal hath flown away, shall not it suffice?<br/>&#160;Hast lost thy wits? &#160;Begone! &#160;And hark ye—come no<br/>more till thou do bring his head."<br/><br/>The poor Chancellor was not long in removing himself from this<br/>dangerous vicinity; nor did the commission waste time in giving the<br/>royal assent to the work of the slavish Parliament, and appointing<br/>the morrow for the beheading of the premier peer of England, the<br/>luckless Duke of Norfolk.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
