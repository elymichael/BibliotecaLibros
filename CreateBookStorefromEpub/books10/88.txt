"I am Edward, King of England."

A wild burst of laughter followed, partly of derision and partly
of delight in the excellence of the joke. &#160;The King was stung.
&#160;He said sharply—

"Ye mannerless vagrants, is this your recognition of the royal
boon I have promised?"

He said more, with angry voice and excited gesture, but it was
lost in a whirlwind of laughter and mocking exclamations.
&#160;'John Hobbs' made several attempts to make himself heard
above the din, and at last succeeded—saying—

"Mates, he is my son, a dreamer, a fool, and stark mad—mind him
not—he thinketh he IS the King."

"I AM the King," said Edward, turning toward him, "as thou shalt
know to thy cost, in good time. &#160;Thou hast confessed a
murder—thou shalt swing for it."

"THOU'LT betray me?—THOU? &#160;An' I get my hands upon
thee—"

"Tut-tut!" said the burley Ruffler, interposing in time to save
the King, and emphasising this service by knocking Hobbs down with
his fist, "hast respect for neither Kings NOR Rufflers? &#160;An'
thou insult my presence so again, I'll hang thee up myself."
&#160;Then he said to his Majesty, "Thou must make no threats
against thy mates, lad; and thou must guard thy tongue from saying
evil of them elsewhere. &#160;BE King, if it please thy mad humour,
but be not harmful in it. &#160;Sink the title thou hast
uttered—'tis treason; we be bad men in some few trifling ways, but
none among us is so base as to be traitor to his King; we be loving
and loyal hearts, in that regard. &#160;Note if I speak truth.
&#160;Now—all together: &#160;'Long live Edward, King of
England!'"

"LONG LIVE EDWARD, KING OF ENGLAND!"

The response came with such a thundergust from the motley crew
that the crazy building vibrated to the sound. &#160;The little
King's face lighted with pleasure for an instant, and he slightly
inclined his head, and said with grave simplicity—

"I thank you, my good people."
