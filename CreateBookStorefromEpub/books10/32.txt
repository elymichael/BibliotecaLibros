Lord Hertford said—

"So please your highness, it is for you to command, it is for us
to obey. That thou should'st rest is indeed a needful thing, since
thou must journey to the city presently."

He touched a bell, and a page appeared, who was ordered to
desire the presence of Sir William Herbert. &#160;This gentleman
came straightway, and conducted Tom to an inner apartment.
&#160;Tom's first movement there was to reach for a cup of water;
but a silk-and-velvet servitor seized it, dropped upon one knee,
and offered it to him on a golden salver.

Next the tired captive sat down and was going to take off his
buskins, timidly asking leave with his eye, but another
silk-and-velvet discomforter went down upon his knees and took the
office from him. &#160;He made two or three further efforts to help
himself, but being promptly forestalled each time, he finally gave
up, with a sigh of resignation and a murmured "Beshrew me, but I
marvel they do not require to breathe for me also!"
&#160;Slippered, and wrapped in a sumptuous robe, he laid himself
down at last to rest, but not to sleep, for his head was too full
of thoughts and the room too full of people. &#160;He could not
dismiss the former, so they stayed; he did not know enough to
dismiss the latter, so they stayed also, to his vast regret—and
theirs.

Tom's departure had left his two noble guardians alone.
&#160;They mused a while, with much head-shaking and walking the
floor, then Lord St. John said—

"Plainly, what dost thou think?"

"Plainly, then, this. &#160;The King is near his end; my nephew
is mad—mad will mount the throne, and mad remain. &#160;God protect
England, since she will need it!"

"Verily it promiseth so, indeed. &#160;But&#160;… have you no
misgivings as to&#160;… as to&#160;… "

The speaker hesitated, and finally stopped. &#160;He evidently
felt that he was upon delicate ground. &#160;Lord Hertford stopped
before him, looked into his face with a clear, frank eye, and
said—

"Speak on—there is none to hear but me. &#160;Misgivings as to
what?"

"I am full loth to word the thing that is in my mind, and thou
so near to him in blood, my lord. &#160;But craving pardon if I do
offend, seemeth it not strange that madness could so change his
port and manner?—not but that his port and speech are princely
still, but that they DIFFER, in one unweighty trifle or another,
from what his custom was aforetime. &#160;Seemeth it not strange
that madness should filch from his memory his father's very
lineaments; the customs and observances that are his due from such
as be about him; and, leaving him his Latin, strip him of his Greek
and French? &#160;My lord, be not offended, but ease my mind of its
disquiet and receive my grateful thanks. &#160;It haunteth me, his
saying he was not the prince, and so—"
