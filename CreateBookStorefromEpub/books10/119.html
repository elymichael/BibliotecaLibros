"Only that thou be blind and dumb and paralytic whilst one may<br/>count a hundred thousand—counting slowly," said Hendon, with the<br/>expression of a man who asks but a reasonable favour, and that a<br/>very little one.<br/><br/>"It is my destruction!" said the constable despairingly.<br/>&#160;"Ah, be reasonable, good sir; only look at this matter, on<br/>all its sides, and see how mere a jest it is—how manifestly and how<br/>plainly it is so. &#160;And even if one granted it were not a jest,<br/>it is a fault so small that e'en the grimmest penalty it could call<br/>forth would be but a rebuke and warning from the judge's lips."<br/><br/>Hendon replied with a solemnity which chilled the air about<br/>him—<br/><br/>"This jest of thine hath a name, in law,—wot you what it<br/>is?"<br/><br/>"I knew it not! &#160;Peradventure I have been unwise. &#160;I<br/>never dreamed it had a name—ah, sweet heaven, I thought it was<br/>original."<br/><br/>"Yes, it hath a name. &#160;In the law this crime is called Non<br/>compos mentis lex talionis sic transit gloria mundi."<br/><br/>"Ah, my God!"<br/><br/>"And the penalty is death!"<br/><br/>"God be merciful to me a sinner!"<br/><br/>"By advantage taken of one in fault, in dire peril, and at thy<br/>mercy, thou hast seized goods worth above thirteenpence ha'penny,<br/>paying but a trifle for the same; and this, in the eye of the law,<br/>is constructive barratry, misprision of treason, malfeasance in<br/>office, ad hominem expurgatis in statu quo—and the penalty is death<br/>by the halter, without ransom, commutation, or benefit of<br/>clergy."<br/><br/>"Bear me up, bear me up, sweet sir, my legs do fail me! &#160;Be<br/>thou merciful—spare me this doom, and I will turn my back and see<br/>nought that shall happen."<br/>
