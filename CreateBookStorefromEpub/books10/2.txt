About Twain:

Samuel Langhorne Clemens (November 30, 1835 â€” April 21, 1910),
better known by the pen name Mark Twain, was an American humorist,
satirist, writer, and lecturer. Twain is most noted for his novels
Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, which has since been called the
Great American Novel, and The Adventures of Tom Sawyer. He is also
known for his quotations. During his lifetime, Clemens became a
friend to presidents, artists, leading industrialists, and European
royalty. Clemens enjoyed immense public popularity, and his keen
wit and incisive satire earned him praise from both critics and
peers. American author William Faulkner called Twain "the father of
American literature." Source: Wikipedia
