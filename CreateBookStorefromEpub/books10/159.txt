He got up, lame, stiff, and half famished, washed himself in the
river, stayed his stomach with a pint or two of water, and trudged
off toward Westminster, grumbling at himself for having wasted so
much time. &#160;Hunger helped him to a new plan, now; he would try
to get speech with old Sir Humphrey Marlow and borrow a few marks,
and—but that was enough of a plan for the present; it would be time
enough to enlarge it when this first stage should be
accomplished.

Toward eleven o'clock he approached the palace; and although a
host of showy people were about him, moving in the same direction,
he was not inconspicuous—his costume took care of that. &#160;He
watched these people's faces narrowly, hoping to find a charitable
one whose possessor might be willing to carry his name to the old
lieutenant—as to trying to get into the palace himself, that was
simply out of the question.

Presently our whipping-boy passed him, then wheeled about and
scanned his figure well, saying to himself, "An' that is not the
very vagabond his Majesty is in such a worry about, then am I an
ass—though belike I was that before. &#160;He answereth the
description to a rag—that God should make two such would be to
cheapen miracles by wasteful repetition. &#160;I would I could
contrive an excuse to speak with him."

Miles Hendon saved him the trouble; for he turned about, then,
as a man generally will when somebody mesmerises him by gazing hard
at him from behind; and observing a strong interest in the boy's
eyes, he stepped toward him and said—

"You have just come out from the palace; do you belong
there?"

"Yes, your worship."

"Know you Sir Humphrey Marlow?"

The boy started, and said to himself, "Lord! mine old departed
father!" Then he answered aloud, "Right well, your worship."

"Good—is he within?"

"Yes," said the boy; and added, to himself, "within his
grave."
