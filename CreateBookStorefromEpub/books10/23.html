Soon there was a general buzz along the corridors, of "The<br/>prince! See, the prince comes!"<br/><br/>Poor Tom came slowly walking past the low-bowing groups, trying<br/>to bow in return, and meekly gazing upon his strange surroundings<br/>with bewildered and pathetic eyes. &#160;Great nobles walked upon<br/>each side of him, making him lean upon them, and so steady his<br/>steps. Behind him followed the court-physicians and some<br/>servants.<br/><br/>Presently Tom found himself in a noble apartment of the palace<br/>and heard the door close behind him. &#160;Around him stood those<br/>who had come with him. Before him, at a little distance, reclined a<br/>very large and very fat man, with a wide, pulpy face, and a stern<br/>expression. &#160;His large head was very grey; and his whiskers,<br/>which he wore only around his face, like a frame, were grey also.<br/>&#160;His clothing was of rich stuff, but old, and slightly frayed<br/>in places. &#160;One of his swollen legs had a pillow under it, and<br/>was wrapped in bandages. &#160;There was silence now; and there was<br/>no head there but was bent in reverence, except this man's.<br/>&#160;This stern-countenanced invalid was the dread Henry VIII.<br/>&#160;He said—and his face grew gentle as he began to speak—<br/><br/>"How now, my lord Edward, my prince? &#160;Hast been minded to<br/>cozen me, the good King thy father, who loveth thee, and kindly<br/>useth thee, with a sorry jest?"<br/><br/>Poor Tom was listening, as well as his dazed faculties would let<br/>him, to the beginning of this speech; but when the words 'me, the<br/>good King' fell upon his ear, his face blanched, and he dropped as<br/>instantly upon his knees as if a shot had brought him there.<br/>Lifting up his hands, he exclaimed—<br/><br/>"Thou the KING? &#160;Then am I undone indeed!"<br/><br/>This speech seemed to stun the King. &#160;His eyes wandered<br/>from face to face aimlessly, then rested, bewildered, upon the boy<br/>before him. &#160;Then he said in a tone of deep<br/>disappointment—<br/><br/>"Alack, I had believed the rumour disproportioned to the truth;<br/>but I fear me 'tis not so." &#160;He breathed a heavy sigh, and<br/>said in a gentle voice, "Come to thy father, child: &#160;thou art<br/>not well."<br/><br/>Tom was assisted to his feet, and approached the Majesty of<br/>England, humble and trembling. &#160;The King took the frightened<br/>face between his hands, and gazed earnestly and lovingly into it<br/>awhile, as if seeking some grateful sign of returning reason there,<br/>then pressed the curly head against his breast, and patted it<br/>tenderly. &#160;Presently he said—<br/><br/>"Dost not know thy father, child? &#160;Break not mine old<br/>heart; say thou know'st me. &#160;Thou DOST know me, dost thou<br/>not?"<br/><br/>"Yea: &#160;thou art my dread lord the King, whom God<br/>preserve!"<br/>
