<br/>When the woman was called upon to testify before the justice of<br/>the peace, she swore that the small prisoner at the bar was the<br/>person who had committed the theft; there was none able to show the<br/>contrary, so the King stood convicted. &#160;The bundle was now<br/>unrolled, and when the contents proved to be a plump little dressed<br/>pig, the judge looked troubled, whilst Hendon turned pale, and his<br/>body was thrilled with an electric shiver of dismay; but the King<br/>remained unmoved, protected by his ignorance. &#160;The judge<br/>meditated, during an ominous pause, then turned to the woman, with<br/>the question—<br/><br/>"What dost thou hold this property to be worth?"<br/><br/>The woman courtesied and replied—<br/><br/>"Three shillings and eightpence, your worship—I could not abate<br/>a penny and set forth the value honestly."<br/><br/>The justice glanced around uncomfortably upon the crowd, then<br/>nodded to the constable, and said—<br/><br/>"Clear the court and close the doors."<br/><br/>It was done. &#160;None remained but the two officials, the<br/>accused, the accuser, and Miles Hendon. &#160;This latter was rigid<br/>and colourless, and on his forehead big drops of cold sweat<br/>gathered, broke and blended together, and trickled down his face.<br/>&#160;The judge turned to the woman again, and said, in a<br/>compassionate voice—<br/><br/>"'Tis a poor ignorant lad, and mayhap was driven hard by hunger,<br/>for these be grievous times for the unfortunate; mark you, he hath<br/>not an evil face—but when hunger driveth—Good woman! dost know that<br/>when one steals a thing above the value of thirteenpence ha'penny<br/>the law saith he shall HANG for it?"<br/><br/>The little King started, wide-eyed with consternation, but<br/>controlled himself and held his peace; but not so the woman.<br/>&#160;She sprang to her feet, shaking with fright, and cried<br/>out—<br/><br/>"Oh, good lack, what have I done! &#160;God-a-mercy, I would not<br/>hang the poor thing for the whole world! &#160;Ah, save me from<br/>this, your worship—what shall I do, what CAN I do?"<br/><br/>
