A smile twinkled in Hendon's eye, and he said to himself—<br/><br/>"By the mass, the little beggar takes to one's quarters and<br/>usurps one's bed with as natural and easy a grace as if he owned<br/>them—with never a by-your-leave or so-please-it-you, or anything of<br/>the sort. &#160;In his diseased ravings he called himself the<br/>Prince of Wales, and bravely doth he keep up the character.<br/>&#160;Poor little friendless rat, doubtless his mind has been<br/>disordered with ill-usage. &#160;Well, I will be his friend; I have<br/>saved him, and it draweth me strongly to him; already I love the<br/>bold-tongued little rascal. &#160;How soldier-like he faced the<br/>smutty rabble and flung back his high defiance! &#160;And what a<br/>comely, sweet and gentle face he hath, now that sleep hath conjured<br/>away its troubles and its griefs. I will teach him; I will cure his<br/>malady; yea, I will be his elder brother, and care for him and<br/>watch over him; and whoso would shame him or do him hurt may order<br/>his shroud, for though I be burnt for it he shall need it!"<br/><br/>He bent over the boy and contemplated him with kind and<br/>pitying interest, tapping the young cheek tenderly and smoothing<br/>back the tangled curls with his great brown hand. &#160;A slight<br/>shiver passed over the boy's form. Hendon muttered—<br/><br/>"See, now, how like a man it was to let him lie here uncovered<br/>and fill his body with deadly rheums. &#160;Now what shall I do?<br/>'twill wake him to take him up and put him within the bed, and he<br/>sorely needeth sleep."<br/><br/>He looked about for extra covering, but finding none, doffed his<br/>doublet and wrapped the lad in it, saying, "I am used to nipping<br/>air and scant apparel, 'tis little I shall mind the cold!"—then<br/>walked up and down the room, to keep his blood in motion,<br/>soliloquising as before.<br/><br/>"His injured mind persuades him he is Prince of Wales; 'twill be<br/>odd to have a Prince of Wales still with us, now that he that WAS<br/>the prince is prince no more, but king—for this poor mind is set<br/>upon the one fantasy, and will not reason out that now it should<br/>cast by the prince and call itself the king… If my father liveth<br/>still, after these seven years that I have heard nought from home<br/>in my foreign dungeon, he will welcome the poor lad and give him<br/>generous shelter for my sake; so will my good elder brother,<br/>Arthur; my other brother, Hugh—but I will crack his crown an HE<br/>interfere, the fox-hearted, ill-conditioned animal! Yes, thither<br/>will we fare—and straightway, too."<br/><br/>A servant entered with a smoking meal, disposed it upon a small<br/>deal table, placed the chairs, and took his departure, leaving such<br/>cheap lodgers as these to wait upon themselves. &#160;The door<br/>slammed after him, and the noise woke the boy, who sprang to a<br/>sitting posture, and shot a glad glance about him; then a grieved<br/>look came into his face and he murmured to himself, with a deep<br/>sigh, "Alack, it was but a dream, woe is me!" &#160;Next he noticed<br/>Miles Hendon's doublet—glanced from that to Hendon, comprehended<br/>the sacrifice that had been made for him, and said, gently—<br/><br/>"Thou art good to me, yes, thou art very good to me. &#160;Take<br/>it and put it on—I shall not need it more."<br/><br/>Then he got up and walked to the washstand in the corner and<br/>stood there, waiting. &#160;Hendon said in a cheery voice—<br/><br/>"We'll have a right hearty sup and bite, now, for everything is<br/>savoury and smoking hot, and that and thy nap together will make<br/>thee a little man again, never fear!"<br/><br/>The boy made no answer, but bent a steady look, that was filled<br/>with grave surprise, and also somewhat touched with impatience,<br/>upon the tall knight of the sword. &#160;Hendon was puzzled, and<br/>said—<br/>
