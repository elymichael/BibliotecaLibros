"How wrought they to bring the storm?"

"BY PULLING OFF THEIR STOCKINGS, sire."

This astonished Tom, and also fired his curiosity to fever heat.
He said, eagerly—

"It is wonderful! &#160;Hath it always this dread effect?"

"Always, my liege—at least if the woman desire it, and utter the
needful words, either in her mind or with her tongue."

Tom turned to the woman, and said with impetuous zeal—

"Exert thy power—I would see a storm!"

There was a sudden paling of cheeks in the superstitious
assemblage, and a general, though unexpressed, desire to get out of
the place—all of which was lost upon Tom, who was dead to
everything but the proposed cataclysm. &#160;Seeing a puzzled and
astonished look in the woman's face, he added, excitedly—

"Never fear—thou shalt be blameless. &#160;More—thou shalt go
free—none shall touch thee. &#160;Exert thy power."

"Oh, my lord the King, I have it not—I have been falsely
accused."
