It was a fair region, dotted with cottages and orchards, and the
road led through broad pasture lands whose receding expanses,
marked with gentle elevations and depressions, suggested the
swelling and subsiding undulations of the sea. &#160;In the
afternoon the returning prodigal made constant deflections from his
course to see if by ascending some hillock he might not pierce the
distance and catch a glimpse of his home. &#160;At last he was
successful, and cried out excitedly—

"There is the village, my Prince, and there is the Hall close
by! You may see the towers from here; and that wood there—that is
my father's park. Ah, NOW thou'lt know what state and grandeur be!
A house with seventy rooms—think of that!—and seven and twenty
servants! &#160;A brave lodging for such as we, is it not so?
&#160;Come, let us speed—my impatience will not brook further
delay."

All possible hurry was made; still, it was after three o'clock
before the village was reached. &#160;The travellers scampered
through it, Hendon's tongue going all the time. &#160;"Here is the
church—covered with the same ivy—none gone, none added."
&#160;"Yonder is the inn, the old Red Lion,—and yonder is the
market-place." &#160;"Here is the Maypole, and here the
pump—nothing is altered; nothing but the people, at any rate; ten
years make a change in people; some of these I seem to know, but
none know me." &#160;So his chat ran on. The end of the village was
soon reached; then the travellers struck into a crooked, narrow
road, walled in with tall hedges, and hurried briskly along it for
half a mile, then passed into a vast flower garden through an
imposing gateway, whose huge stone pillars bore sculptured armorial
devices. &#160;A noble mansion was before them.

"Welcome to Hendon Hall, my King!" exclaimed Miles. &#160;"Ah,
'tis a great day! &#160;My father and my brother, and the Lady
Edith will be so mad with joy that they will have eyes and tongue
for none but me in the first transports of the meeting, and so
thou'lt seem but coldly welcomed—but mind it not; 'twill soon seem
otherwise; for when I say thou art my ward, and tell them how
costly is my love for thee, thou'lt see them take thee to their
breasts for Miles Hendon's sake, and make their house and hearts
thy home for ever after!"

The next moment Hendon sprang to the ground before the great
door, helped the King down, then took him by the hand and rushed
within. A few steps brought him to a spacious apartment; he
entered, seated the King with more hurry than ceremony, then ran
toward a young man who sat at a writing-table in front of a
generous fire of logs.

"Embrace me, Hugh," he cried, "and say thou'rt glad I am come
again! and call our father, for home is not home till I shall touch
his hand, and see his face, and hear his voice once more!"

But Hugh only drew back, after betraying a momentary surprise,
and bent a grave stare upon the intruder—a stare which indicated
somewhat of offended dignity, at first, then changed, in response
to some inward thought or purpose, to an expression of marvelling
curiosity, mixed with a real or assumed compassion. &#160;Presently
he said, in a mild voice—

"Thy wits seem touched, poor stranger; doubtless thou hast
suffered privations and rude buffetings at the world's hands; thy
looks and dress betoken it. &#160;Whom dost thou take me to
be?"

"Take thee? &#160;Prithee for whom else than whom thou art?
&#160;I take thee to be Hugh Hendon," said Miles, sharply.

The other continued, in the same soft tone—
