The Prince with the peasants


When the King awoke in the early morning, he found that a wet
but thoughtful rat had crept into the place during the night and
made a cosy bed for itself in his bosom. &#160;Being disturbed now,
it scampered away. The boy smiled, and said, "Poor fool, why so
fearful? &#160;I am as forlorn as thou. &#160;'Twould be a sham in
me to hurt the helpless, who am myself so helpless. &#160;Moreover,
I owe you thanks for a good omen; for when a king has fallen so low
that the very rats do make a bed of him, it surely meaneth that his
fortunes be upon the turn, since it is plain he can no lower
go."

He got up and stepped out of the stall, and just then he heard
the sound of children's voices. &#160;The barn door opened and a
couple of little girls came in. &#160;As soon as they saw him their
talking and laughing ceased, and they stopped and stood still,
gazing at him with strong curiosity; they presently began to
whisper together, then they approached nearer, and stopped again to
gaze and whisper. &#160;By-and-by they gathered courage and began
to discuss him aloud. &#160;One said—

"He hath a comely face."

The other added—

"And pretty hair."

"But is ill clothed enow."

"And how starved he looketh."
