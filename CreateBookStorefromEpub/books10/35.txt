"I crave your indulgence: &#160;my nose itcheth cruelly.
&#160;What is the custom and usage in this emergence?
&#160;Prithee, speed, for 'tis but a little time that I can bear
it."

None smiled; but all were sore perplexed, and looked one to the
other in deep tribulation for counsel. &#160;But behold, here was a
dead wall, and nothing in English history to tell how to get over
it. &#160;The Master of Ceremonies was not present: &#160;there was
no one who felt safe to venture upon this uncharted sea, or risk
the attempt to solve this solemn problem. &#160;Alas! there was no
Hereditary Scratcher. &#160;Meantime the tears had overflowed their
banks, and begun to trickle down Tom's cheeks. &#160;His twitching
nose was pleading more urgently than ever for relief. &#160;At last
nature broke down the barriers of etiquette: &#160;Tom lifted up an
inward prayer for pardon if he was doing wrong, and brought relief
to the burdened hearts of his court by scratching his nose
himself.

His meal being ended, a lord came and held before him a broad,
shallow, golden dish with fragrant rosewater in it, to cleanse his
mouth and fingers with; and my lord the Hereditary Diaperer stood
by with a napkin for his use. &#160;Tom gazed at the dish a puzzled
moment or two, then raised it to his lips, and gravely took a
draught. &#160;Then he returned it to the waiting lord, and
said—

"Nay, it likes me not, my lord: &#160;it hath a pretty flavour,
but it wanteth strength."

This new eccentricity of the prince's ruined mind made all the
hearts about him ache; but the sad sight moved none to
merriment.

Tom's next unconscious blunder was to get up and leave the table
just when the chaplain had taken his stand behind his chair, and
with uplifted hands, and closed, uplifted eyes, was in the act of
beginning the blessing. &#160;Still nobody seemed to perceive that
the prince had done a thing unusual.

By his own request our small friend was now conducted to his
private cabinet, and left there alone to his own devices.
&#160;Hanging upon hooks in the oaken wainscoting were the several
pieces of a suit of shining steel armour, covered all over with
beautiful designs exquisitely inlaid in gold. &#160;This martial
panoply belonged to the true prince—a recent present from Madam
Parr the Queen. Tom put on the greaves, the gauntlets, the plumed
helmet, and such other pieces as he could don without assistance,
and for a while was minded to call for help and complete the
matter, but bethought him of the nuts he had brought away from
dinner, and the joy it would be to eat them with no crowd to eye
him, and no Grand Hereditaries to pester him with undesired
services; so he restored the pretty things to their several places,
and soon was cracking nuts, and feeling almost naturally happy for
the first time since God for his sins had made him a prince.
&#160;When the nuts were all gone, he stumbled upon some inviting
books in a closet, among them one about the etiquette of the
English court. &#160;This was a prize. He lay down upon a sumptuous
divan, and proceeded to instruct himself with honest zeal.
&#160;Let us leave him there for the present.
