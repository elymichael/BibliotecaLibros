"Belike thou'lt change thy note eftsoons. &#160;An thou would
save thy neck, nothing but flight may stead thee. &#160;The man is
this moment delivering up the ghost. &#160;'Tis the priest, Father
Andrew!"

"God-a-mercy!" exclaimed Canty. &#160;He roused his family, and
hoarsely commanded, "Up with ye all and fly—or bide where ye are
and perish!"

Scarcely five minutes later the Canty household were in the
street and flying for their lives. &#160;John Canty held the Prince
by the wrist, and hurried him along the dark way, giving him this
caution in a low voice—

"Mind thy tongue, thou mad fool, and speak not our name. &#160;I
will choose me a new name, speedily, to throw the law's dogs off
the scent. &#160;Mind thy tongue, I tell thee!"

He growled these words to the rest of the family—

"If it so chance that we be separated, let each make for London
Bridge; whoso findeth himself as far as the last linen-draper's
shop on the bridge, let him tarry there till the others be come,
then will we flee into Southwark together."

At this moment the party burst suddenly out of darkness into
light; and not only into light, but into the midst of a multitude
of singing, dancing, and shouting people, massed together on the
river frontage. There was a line of bonfires stretching as far as
one could see, up and down the Thames; London Bridge was
illuminated; Southwark Bridge likewise; the entire river was aglow
with the flash and sheen of coloured lights; and constant
explosions of fireworks filled the skies with an intricate
commingling of shooting splendours and a thick rain of dazzling
sparks that almost turned night into day; everywhere were crowds of
revellers; all London seemed to be at large.

John Canty delivered himself of a furious curse and commanded a
retreat; but it was too late. &#160;He and his tribe were swallowed
up in that swarming hive of humanity, and hopelessly separated from
each other in an instant. We are not considering that the Prince
was one of his tribe; Canty still kept his grip upon him. &#160;The
Prince's heart was beating high with hopes of escape, now. &#160;A
burly waterman, considerably exalted with liquor, found himself
rudely shoved by Canty in his efforts to plough through the crowd;
he laid his great hand on Canty's shoulder and said—

"Nay, whither so fast, friend? &#160;Dost canker thy soul with
sordid business when all that be leal men and true make
holiday?"

"Mine affairs are mine own, they concern thee not," answered
Canty, roughly; "take away thy hand and let me pass."
