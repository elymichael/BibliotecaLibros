'Welcome, O King! as much as hearts can think;<br/>Welcome, again, as much as tongue can tell,—<br/>Welcome to joyous tongues, and hearts that will not<br/>shrink:&#160;<br/>God thee preserve, we pray, and wish thee ever well.'<br/><br/><br/>The people burst forth in a glad shout, repeating with one voice<br/>what the child had said. &#160;Tom Canty gazed abroad over the<br/>surging sea of eager faces, and his heart swelled with exultation;<br/>and he felt that the one thing worth living for in this world was<br/>to be a king, and a nation's idol. &#160;Presently he caught sight,<br/>at a distance, of a couple of his ragged Offal Court comrades—one<br/>of them the lord high admiral in his late mimic court, the other<br/>the first lord of the bedchamber in the same pretentious fiction;<br/>and his pride swelled higher than ever. &#160;Oh, if they could<br/>only recognise him now! &#160;What unspeakable glory it would be,<br/>if they could recognise him, and realise that the derided mock king<br/>of the slums and back alleys was become a real King, with<br/>illustrious dukes and princes for his humble menials, and the<br/>English world at his feet! &#160;But he had to deny himself, and<br/>choke down his desire, for such a recognition might cost more than<br/>it would come to: &#160;so he turned away his head, and left the<br/>two soiled lads to go on with their shoutings and glad adulations,<br/>unsuspicious of whom it was they were lavishing them upon.<br/><br/>Every now and then rose the cry, "A largess! a largess!" and Tom<br/>responded by scattering a handful of bright new coins abroad for<br/>the multitude to scramble for.<br/><br/>The chronicler says, 'At the upper end of Gracechurch Street,<br/>before the sign of the Eagle, the city had erected a gorgeous arch,<br/>beneath which was a stage, which stretched from one side of the<br/>street to the other. This was an historical pageant, representing<br/>the King's immediate progenitors. &#160;There sat Elizabeth of York<br/>in the midst of an immense white rose, whose petals formed<br/>elaborate furbelows around her; by her side was Henry VII., issuing<br/>out of a vast red rose, disposed in the same manner: &#160;the<br/>hands of the royal pair were locked together, and the wedding-ring<br/>ostentatiously displayed. &#160;From the red and white roses<br/>proceeded a stem, which reached up to a second stage, occupied by<br/>Henry VIII., issuing from a red and white rose, with the effigy of<br/>the new King's mother, Jane Seymour, represented by his side.<br/>&#160;One branch sprang from this pair, which mounted to a third<br/>stage, where sat the effigy of Edward VI. himself, enthroned in<br/>royal majesty; and the whole pageant was framed with wreaths of<br/>roses, red and white.'<br/><br/>This quaint and gaudy spectacle so wrought upon the rejoicing<br/>people, that their acclamations utterly smothered the small voice<br/>of the child whose business it was to explain the thing in<br/>eulogistic rhymes. &#160;But Tom Canty was not sorry; for this<br/>loyal uproar was sweeter music to him than any poetry, no matter<br/>what its quality might be. &#160;Whithersoever Tom turned his happy<br/>young face, the people recognised the exactness of his effigy's<br/>likeness to himself, the flesh and blood counterpart; and new<br/>whirlwinds of applause burst forth.<br/><br/>The great pageant moved on, and still on, under one triumphal<br/>arch after another, and past a bewildering succession of<br/>spectacular and symbolical tableaux, each of which typified and<br/>exalted some virtue, or talent, or merit, of the little King's.<br/>&#160;'Throughout the whole of Cheapside, from every penthouse and<br/>window, hung banners and streamers; and the richest carpets,<br/>stuffs, and cloth-of-gold tapestried the streets—specimens of the<br/>great wealth of the stores within; and the splendour of this<br/>thoroughfare was equalled in the other streets, and in some even<br/>surpassed.'<br/><br/>"And all these wonders and these marvels are to welcome me—me!"<br/>murmured Tom Canty.<br/><br/>The mock King's cheeks were flushed with excitement, his eyes<br/>were flashing, his senses swam in a delirium of pleasure. &#160;At<br/>this point, just as he was raising his hand to fling another rich<br/>largess, he caught sight of a pale, astounded face, which was<br/>strained forward out of the second rank of the crowd, its intense<br/>eyes riveted upon him. &#160;A sickening consternation struck<br/>through him; he recognised his mother! and up flew his hand, palm<br/>outward, before his eyes—that old involuntary gesture, born of a<br/>forgotten episode, and perpetuated by habit. &#160;In an instant<br/>more she had torn her way out of the press, and past the guards,<br/>and was at his side. &#160;She embraced his leg, she covered it<br/>with kisses, she cried, "O my child, my darling!" lifting toward<br/>him a face that was transfigured with joy and love. &#160;The same<br/>instant an officer of the King's Guard snatched her away with a<br/>curse, and sent her reeling back whence she came with a vigorous<br/>impulse from his strong arm. &#160;The words "I do not know you,<br/>woman!" were falling from Tom Canty's lips when this piteous thing<br/>occurred; but it smote him to the heart to see her treated so; and<br/>as she turned for a last glimpse of him, whilst the crowd was<br/>swallowing her from his sight, she seemed so wounded, so<br/>broken-hearted, that a shame fell upon him which consumed his pride<br/>to ashes, and withered his stolen royalty. &#160;His grandeurs were<br/>stricken valueless: they seemed to fall away from him like rotten<br/>rags.<br/><br/>The procession moved on, and still on, through ever augmenting<br/>splendours and ever augmenting tempests of welcome; but to Tom<br/>Canty they were as if they had not been. &#160;He neither saw nor<br/>heard. &#160;Royalty had lost its grace and sweetness; its pomps<br/>were become a reproach. &#160;Remorse was eating his heart out.<br/>&#160;He said, "Would God I were free of my captivity!"<br/>
