The weighty business of dressing began, and one courtier after<br/>another knelt and paid his court and offered to the little King his<br/>condolences upon his heavy loss, whilst the dressing proceeded.<br/>&#160;In the beginning, a shirt was taken up by the Chief Equerry<br/>in Waiting, who passed it to the First Lord of the Buckhounds, who<br/>passed it to the Second Gentleman of the Bedchamber, who passed it<br/>to the Head Ranger of Windsor Forest, who passed it to the Third<br/>Groom of the Stole, who passed it to the Chancellor Royal of the<br/>Duchy of Lancaster, who passed it to the Master of the Wardrobe,<br/>who passed it to Norroy King-at-Arms, who passed it to the<br/>Constable of the Tower, who passed it to the Chief Steward of the<br/>Household, who passed it to the Hereditary Grand Diaperer, who<br/>passed it to the Lord High Admiral of England, who passed it to the<br/>Archbishop of Canterbury, who passed it to the First Lord of the<br/>Bedchamber, who took what was left of it and put it on Tom.<br/>&#160;Poor little wondering chap, it reminded him of passing<br/>buckets at a fire.<br/><br/>Each garment in its turn had to go through this slow and solemn<br/>process; consequently Tom grew very weary of the ceremony; so weary<br/>that he felt an almost gushing gratefulness when he at last saw his<br/>long silken hose begin the journey down the line and knew that the<br/>end of the matter was drawing near. &#160;But he exulted too soon.<br/>&#160;The First Lord of the Bedchamber received the hose and was<br/>about to encase Tom's legs in them, when a sudden flush invaded his<br/>face and he hurriedly hustled the things back into the hands of the<br/>Archbishop of Canterbury with an astounded look and a whispered,<br/>"See, my lord!" pointing to a something connected with the hose.<br/>&#160;The Archbishop paled, then flushed, and passed the hose to<br/>the Lord High Admiral, whispering, "See, my lord!" &#160;The<br/>Admiral passed the hose to the Hereditary Grand Diaperer, and had<br/>hardly breath enough in his body to ejaculate, "See, my lord!"<br/>&#160;The hose drifted backward along the line, to the Chief<br/>Steward of the Household, the Constable of the Tower, Norroy<br/>King-at-Arms, the Master of the Wardrobe, the Chancellor Royal of<br/>the Duchy of Lancaster, the Third Groom of the Stole, the Head<br/>Ranger of Windsor Forest, the Second Gentleman of the Bedchamber,<br/>the First Lord of the Buckhounds,—accompanied always with that<br/>amazed and frightened "See! see!"—till they finally reached the<br/>hands of the Chief Equerry in Waiting, who gazed a moment, with a<br/>pallid face, upon what had caused all this dismay, then hoarsely<br/>whispered, "Body of my life, a tag gone from a truss-point!—to the<br/>Tower with the Head Keeper of the King's Hose!"—after which he<br/>leaned upon the shoulder of the First Lord of the Buckhounds to<br/>regather his vanished strength whilst fresh hose, without any<br/>damaged strings to them, were brought.<br/><br/>But all things must have an end, and so in time Tom Canty was in<br/>a condition to get out of bed. &#160;The proper official poured<br/>water, the proper official engineered the washing, the proper<br/>official stood by with a towel, and by-and-by Tom got safely<br/>through the purifying stage and was ready for the services of the<br/>Hairdresser-royal. &#160;When he at length emerged from this<br/>master's hands, he was a gracious figure and as pretty as a girl,<br/>in his mantle and trunks of purple satin, and purple-plumed cap.<br/>&#160;He now moved in state toward his breakfast-room, through the<br/>midst of the courtly assemblage; and as he passed, these fell back,<br/>leaving his way free, and dropped upon their knees.<br/><br/>After breakfast he was conducted, with regal ceremony, attended<br/>by his great officers and his guard of fifty Gentlemen Pensioners<br/>bearing gilt battle-axes, to the throne-room, where he proceeded to<br/>transact business of state. &#160;His 'uncle,' Lord Hertford, took<br/>his stand by the throne, to assist the royal mind with wise<br/>counsel.<br/><br/>The body of illustrious men named by the late King as his<br/>executors appeared, to ask Tom's approval of certain acts of<br/>theirs—rather a form, and yet not wholly a form, since there was no<br/>Protector as yet. &#160;The Archbishop of Canterbury made report of<br/>the decree of the Council of Executors concerning the obsequies of<br/>his late most illustrious Majesty, and finished by reading the<br/>signatures of the Executors, to wit: &#160;the Archbishop of<br/>Canterbury; the Lord Chancellor of England; William Lord St. John;<br/>John Lord Russell; Edward Earl of Hertford; John Viscount Lisle;<br/>Cuthbert Bishop of Durham—<br/><br/>Tom was not listening—an earlier clause of the document was<br/>puzzling him. &#160;At this point he turned and whispered to Lord<br/>Hertford—<br/><br/>"What day did he say the burial hath been appointed for?"<br/><br/>"The sixteenth of the coming month, my liege."<br/><br/>"'Tis a strange folly. &#160;Will he keep?"<br/><br/>Poor chap, he was still new to the customs of royalty; he was<br/>used to seeing the forlorn dead of Offal Court hustled out of the<br/>way with a very different sort of expedition. &#160;However, the<br/>Lord Hertford set his mind at rest with a word or two.<br/><br/>A secretary of state presented an order of the Council<br/>appointing the morrow at eleven for the reception of the foreign<br/>ambassadors, and desired the King's assent.<br/>
