He had unconsciously dropped back into the phraseology of the
first days of his compulsory greatness.

The shining pageant still went winding like a radiant and
interminable serpent down the crooked lanes of the quaint old city,
and through the huzzaing hosts; but still the King rode with bowed
head and vacant eyes, seeing only his mother's face and that
wounded look in it.

"Largess, largess!" &#160;The cry fell upon an unheeding
ear.

"Long live Edward of England!" &#160;It seemed as if the earth
shook with the explosion; but there was no response from the King.
&#160;He heard it only as one hears the thunder of the surf when it
is blown to the ear out of a great distance, for it was smothered
under another sound which was still nearer, in his own breast, in
his accusing conscience—a voice which kept repeating those shameful
words, "I do not know you, woman!"

The words smote upon the King's soul as the strokes of a funeral
bell smite upon the soul of a surviving friend when they remind him
of secret treacheries suffered at his hands by him that is
gone.

New glories were unfolded at every turning; new wonders, new
marvels, sprang into view; the pent clamours of waiting batteries
were released; new raptures poured from the throats of the waiting
multitudes: &#160;but the King gave no sign, and the accusing voice
that went moaning through his comfortless breast was all the sound
he heard.

By-and-by the gladness in the faces of the populace changed a
little, and became touched with a something like solicitude or
anxiety: &#160;an abatement in the volume of the applause was
observable too. &#160;The Lord Protector was quick to notice these
things: &#160;he was as quick to detect the cause. &#160;He spurred
to the King's side, bent low in his saddle, uncovered, and
said—

"My liege, it is an ill time for dreaming. &#160;The people
observe thy downcast head, thy clouded mien, and they take it for
an omen. &#160;Be advised: &#160;unveil the sun of royalty, and let
it shine upon these boding vapours, and disperse them. &#160;Lift
up thy face, and smile upon the people."

So saying, the Duke scattered a handful of coins to right and
left, then retired to his place. &#160;The mock King did
mechanically as he had been bidden. &#160;His smile had no heart in
it, but few eyes were near enough or sharp enough to detect that.
&#160;The noddings of his plumed head as he saluted his subjects
were full of grace and graciousness; the largess which he delivered
from his hand was royally liberal: &#160;so the people's anxiety
vanished, and the acclamations burst forth again in as mighty a
volume as before.

Still once more, a little before the progress was ended, the
Duke was obliged to ride forward, and make remonstrance. &#160;He
whispered—
