<br/>"Will they scourge thee? &#160;No, no, they would not be so<br/>cruel! &#160;Say they would not. &#160;Come, they WILL not, will<br/>they?"<br/><br/>The women betrayed confusion and distress, but there was no<br/>avoiding an answer, so one of them said, in a voice choked with<br/>emotion—<br/><br/>"Oh, thou'lt break our hearts, thou gentle spirit!—God will help<br/>us to bear our—"<br/><br/>"It is a confession!" the King broke in. &#160;"Then they WILL<br/>scourge thee, the stony-hearted wretches! &#160;But oh, thou must<br/>not weep, I cannot bear it. &#160;Keep up thy courage—I shall come<br/>to my own in time to save thee from this bitter thing, and I will<br/>do it!"<br/><br/>When the King awoke in the morning, the women were gone.<br/><br/>"They are saved!" he said, joyfully; then added, despondently,<br/>"but woe is me!—for they were my comforters."<br/><br/>Each of them had left a shred of ribbon pinned to his clothing,<br/>in token of remembrance. &#160;He said he would keep these things<br/>always; and that soon he would seek out these dear good friends of<br/>his and take them under his protection.<br/><br/>Just then the jailer came in with some subordinates, and<br/>commanded that the prisoners be conducted to the jail-yard.<br/>&#160;The King was overjoyed—it would be a blessed thing to see the<br/>blue sky and breathe the fresh air once more. &#160;He fretted and<br/>chafed at the slowness of the officers, but his turn came at last,<br/>and he was released from his staple and ordered to follow the other<br/>prisoners with Hendon.<br/><br/>The court or quadrangle was stone-paved, and open to the sky.<br/>&#160;The prisoners entered it through a massive archway of<br/>masonry, and were placed in file, standing, with their backs<br/>against the wall. A rope was stretched in front of them, and they<br/>were also guarded by their officers. It was a chill and lowering<br/>morning, and a light snow which had fallen during the night<br/>whitened the great empty space and added to the general dismalness<br/>of its aspect. Now and then a wintry wind shivered through the<br/>place and sent the snow eddying hither and thither.<br/><br/>In the centre of the court stood two women, chained to posts.<br/>&#160;A glance showed the King that these were his good friends.<br/>&#160;He shuddered, and said to himself, "Alack, they are not gone<br/>free, as I had thought. &#160;To think that such as these should<br/>know the lash!—in England! &#160;Ay, there's the shame of it—not in<br/>Heathennesse, Christian England! &#160;They will be scourged; and<br/>I, whom they have comforted and kindly entreated, must look on and<br/>see the great wrong done; it is strange, so strange, that I, the<br/>very source of power in this broad realm, am helpless to protect<br/>them. But let these miscreants look well to themselves, for there<br/>is a day coming when I will require of them a heavy reckoning for<br/>this work. &#160;For every blow they strike now, they shall feel a<br/>hundred then."<br/><br/>
