<br/>"True, true—that is well—be comforted, tremble not so; there is<br/>none here would hurt thee; there is none here but loves thee. Thou<br/>art better now; thy ill dream passeth—is't not so? &#160;Thou wilt<br/>not miscall thyself again, as they say thou didst a little while<br/>agone?"<br/><br/>"I pray thee of thy grace believe me, I did but speak the truth,<br/>most dread lord; for I am the meanest among thy subjects, being a<br/>pauper born, and 'tis by a sore mischance and accident I am here,<br/>albeit I was therein nothing blameful. &#160;I am but young to die,<br/>and thou canst save me with one little word. &#160;Oh speak it,<br/>sir!"<br/><br/>"Die? &#160;Talk not so, sweet prince—peace, peace, to thy<br/>troubled heart—thou shalt not die!"<br/><br/>Tom dropped upon his knees with a glad cry—<br/><br/>"God requite thy mercy, O my King, and save thee long to bless<br/>thy land!" Then springing up, he turned a joyful face toward the<br/>two lords in waiting, and exclaimed, "Thou heard'st it! &#160;I am<br/>not to die: &#160;the King hath said it!" &#160;There was no<br/>movement, save that all bowed with grave respect; but no one spoke.<br/>&#160;He hesitated, a little confused, then turned timidly toward<br/>the King, saying, "I may go now?"<br/><br/>"Go? &#160;Surely, if thou desirest. &#160;But why not tarry yet<br/>a little? Whither would'st go?"<br/><br/>Tom dropped his eyes, and answered humbly—<br/><br/>"Peradventure I mistook; but I did think me free, and so was I<br/>moved to seek again the kennel where I was born and bred to misery,<br/>yet which harboureth my mother and my sisters, and so is home to<br/>me; whereas these pomps and splendours whereunto I am not used—oh,<br/>please you, sir, to let me go!"<br/><br/>The King was silent and thoughtful a while, and his face<br/>betrayed a growing distress and uneasiness. &#160;Presently he<br/>said, with something of hope in his voice—<br/><br/>"Perchance he is but mad upon this one strain, and hath his wits<br/>unmarred as toucheth other matter. &#160;God send it may be so!<br/>&#160;We will make trial."<br/><br/>
