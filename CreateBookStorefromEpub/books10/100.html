<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>20<br/>The Prince and the hermit<br/><br/><br/>The high hedge hid him from the house, now; and so, under the<br/>impulse of a deadly fright, he let out all his forces and sped<br/>toward a wood in the distance. &#160;He never looked back until he<br/>had almost gained the shelter of the forest; then he turned and<br/>descried two figures in the distance. That was sufficient; he did<br/>not wait to scan them critically, but hurried on, and never abated<br/>his pace till he was far within the twilight depths of the wood.<br/>Then he stopped; being persuaded that he was now tolerably safe. He<br/>listened intently, but the stillness was profound and solemn—awful,<br/>even, and depressing to the spirits. &#160;At wide intervals his<br/>straining ear did detect sounds, but they were so remote, and<br/>hollow, and mysterious, that they seemed not to be real sounds, but<br/>only the moaning and complaining ghosts of departed ones. &#160;So<br/>the sounds were yet more dreary than the silence which they<br/>interrupted.<br/><br/>It was his purpose, in the beginning, to stay where he was the<br/>rest of the day; but a chill soon invaded his perspiring body, and<br/>he was at last obliged to resume movement in order to get warm. He<br/>struck straight through the forest, hoping to pierce to a road<br/>presently, but he was disappointed in this. &#160;He travelled on<br/>and on; but the farther he went, the denser the wood became,<br/>apparently. &#160;The gloom began to thicken, by-and-by, and the<br/>King realised that the night was coming on. &#160;It made him<br/>shudder to think of spending it in such an uncanny place; so he<br/>tried to hurry faster, but he only made the less speed, for he<br/>could not now see well enough to choose his steps judiciously;<br/>consequently he kept tripping over roots and tangling himself in<br/>vines and briers.<br/><br/>And how glad he was when at last he caught the glimmer of a<br/>light! He approached it warily, stopping often to look about him<br/>and listen. &#160;It came from an unglazed window-opening in a<br/>shabby little hut. &#160;He heard a voice, now, and felt a<br/>disposition to run and hide; but he changed his mind at once, for<br/>this voice was praying, evidently. &#160;He glided to the one<br/>window of the hut, raised himself on tiptoe, and stole a glance<br/>within. &#160;The room was small; its floor was the natural earth,<br/>beaten hard by use; in a corner was a bed of rushes and a ragged<br/>blanket or two; near it was a pail, a cup, a basin, and two or<br/>three pots and pans; there was a short bench and a three-legged<br/>stool; on the hearth the remains of a faggot fire were smouldering;<br/>before a shrine, which was lighted by a single candle, knelt an<br/>aged man, and on an old wooden box at his side lay an open book and<br/>a human skull. &#160;The man was of large, bony frame; his hair and<br/>whiskers were very long and snowy white; he was clothed in a robe<br/>of sheepskins which reached from his neck to his heels.<br/><br/>"A holy hermit!" said the King to himself; "now am I indeed<br/>fortunate."<br/><br/>The hermit rose from his knees; the King knocked. &#160;A deep<br/>voice responded—<br/><br/>"Enter!—but leave sin behind, for the ground whereon thou shalt<br/>stand is holy!"<br/><br/>The King entered, and paused. &#160;The hermit turned a pair of<br/>gleaming, unrestful eyes upon him, and said—<br/>
