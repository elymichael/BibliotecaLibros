"Might I crave your favour to carry my name to him, and say I<br/>beg to say a word in his ear?"<br/><br/>"I will despatch the business right willingly, fair sir."<br/><br/>"Then say Miles Hendon, son of Sir Richard, is here without—I<br/>shall be greatly bounden to you, my good lad."<br/><br/>The boy looked disappointed. &#160;"The King did not name him<br/>so," he said to himself; "but it mattereth not, this is his twin<br/>brother, and can give his Majesty news of t'other<br/>Sir-Odds-and-Ends, I warrant." &#160;So he said to Miles, "Step in<br/>there a moment, good sir, and wait till I bring you word."<br/><br/>Hendon retired to the place indicated—it was a recess sunk in<br/>the palace wall, with a stone bench in it—a shelter for sentinels<br/>in bad weather. He had hardly seated himself when some halberdiers,<br/>in charge of an officer, passed by. &#160;The officer saw him,<br/>halted his men, and commanded Hendon to come forth. &#160;He<br/>obeyed, and was promptly arrested as a suspicious character<br/>prowling within the precincts of the palace. &#160;Things began to<br/>look ugly. &#160;Poor Miles was going to explain, but the officer<br/>roughly silenced him, and ordered his men to disarm him and search<br/>him.<br/><br/>"God of his mercy grant that they find somewhat," said poor<br/>Miles; "I have searched enow, and failed, yet is my need greater<br/>than theirs."<br/><br/>Nothing was found but a document. &#160;The officer tore it<br/>open, and Hendon smiled when he recognised the 'pot-hooks' made by<br/>his lost little friend that black day at Hendon Hall. &#160;The<br/>officer's face grew dark as he read the English paragraph, and<br/>Miles blenched to the opposite colour as he listened.<br/><br/>"Another new claimant of the Crown!" cried the officer.<br/>&#160;"Verily they breed like rabbits, to-day. &#160;Seize the<br/>rascal, men, and see ye keep him fast whilst I convey this precious<br/>paper within and send it to the King."<br/><br/>He hurried away, leaving the prisoner in the grip of the<br/>halberdiers.<br/><br/>"Now is my evil luck ended at last," muttered Hendon, "for I<br/>shall dangle at a rope's end for a certainty, by reason of that bit<br/>of writing. &#160;And what will become of my poor lad!—ah, only the<br/>good God knoweth."<br/><br/>By-and-by he saw the officer coming again, in a great hurry; so<br/>he plucked his courage together, purposing to meet his trouble as<br/>became a man. &#160;The officer ordered the men to loose the<br/>prisoner and return his sword to him; then bowed respectfully, and<br/>said—<br/>
