<br/>He got up, lame, stiff, and half famished, washed himself in the<br/>river, stayed his stomach with a pint or two of water, and trudged<br/>off toward Westminster, grumbling at himself for having wasted so<br/>much time. &#160;Hunger helped him to a new plan, now; he would try<br/>to get speech with old Sir Humphrey Marlow and borrow a few marks,<br/>and—but that was enough of a plan for the present; it would be time<br/>enough to enlarge it when this first stage should be<br/>accomplished.<br/><br/>Toward eleven o'clock he approached the palace; and although a<br/>host of showy people were about him, moving in the same direction,<br/>he was not inconspicuous—his costume took care of that. &#160;He<br/>watched these people's faces narrowly, hoping to find a charitable<br/>one whose possessor might be willing to carry his name to the old<br/>lieutenant—as to trying to get into the palace himself, that was<br/>simply out of the question.<br/><br/>Presently our whipping-boy passed him, then wheeled about and<br/>scanned his figure well, saying to himself, "An' that is not the<br/>very vagabond his Majesty is in such a worry about, then am I an<br/>ass—though belike I was that before. &#160;He answereth the<br/>description to a rag—that God should make two such would be to<br/>cheapen miracles by wasteful repetition. &#160;I would I could<br/>contrive an excuse to speak with him."<br/><br/>Miles Hendon saved him the trouble; for he turned about, then,<br/>as a man generally will when somebody mesmerises him by gazing hard<br/>at him from behind; and observing a strong interest in the boy's<br/>eyes, he stepped toward him and said—<br/><br/>"You have just come out from the palace; do you belong<br/>there?"<br/><br/>"Yes, your worship."<br/><br/>"Know you Sir Humphrey Marlow?"<br/><br/>The boy started, and said to himself, "Lord! mine old departed<br/>father!" Then he answered aloud, "Right well, your worship."<br/><br/>"Good—is he within?"<br/><br/>"Yes," said the boy; and added, to himself, "within his<br/>grave."<br/><br/>
