"Peace, my lord, thou utterest treason! &#160;Hast forgot the
King's command? Remember I am party to thy crime if I but
listen."

St. John paled, and hastened to say—

"I was in fault, I do confess it. &#160;Betray me not, grant me
this grace out of thy courtesy, and I will neither think nor speak
of this thing more. Deal not hardly with me, sir, else am I
ruined."

"I am content, my lord. &#160;So thou offend not again, here or
in the ears of others, it shall be as though thou hadst not spoken.
&#160;But thou need'st not have misgivings. &#160;He is my sister's
son; are not his voice, his face, his form, familiar to me from his
cradle? Madness can do all the odd conflicting things thou seest in
him, and more. &#160;Dost not recall how that the old Baron Marley,
being mad, forgot the favour of his own countenance that he had
known for sixty years, and held it was another's; nay, even claimed
he was the son of Mary Magdalene, and that his head was made of
Spanish glass; and, sooth to say, he suffered none to touch it,
lest by mischance some heedless hand might shiver it? &#160;Give
thy misgivings easement, good my lord. &#160;This is the very
prince—I know him well—and soon will be thy king; it may advantage
thee to bear this in mind, and more dwell upon it than the
other."

After some further talk, in which the Lord St. John covered up
his mistake as well as he could by repeated protests that his faith
was thoroughly grounded now, and could not be assailed by doubts
again, the Lord Hertford relieved his fellow-keeper, and sat down
to keep watch and ward alone. &#160;He was soon deep in meditation,
and evidently the longer he thought, the more he was bothered.
&#160;By-and-by he began to pace the floor and mutter.

"Tush, he MUST be the prince! &#160;Will any be in all the land
maintain there can be two, not of one blood and birth, so
marvellously twinned? &#160;And even were it so, 'twere yet a
stranger miracle that chance should cast the one into the other's
place. Nay, 'tis folly, folly, folly!"

Presently he said—

"Now were he impostor and called himself prince, look you THAT
would be natural; that would be reasonable. &#160;But lived ever an
impostor yet, who, being called prince by the king, prince by the
court, prince by all, DENIED his dignity and pleaded against his
exaltation? &#160;NO! &#160;By the soul of St. Swithin, no!
&#160;This is the true prince, gone mad!"
