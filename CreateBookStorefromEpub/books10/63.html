<br/>"Alack, it was no dream! &#160;Go to thy rest, sweet sir—leave<br/>me to my sorrows."<br/><br/>Tom slept again, and after a time he had this pleasant dream.<br/>&#160;He thought it was summer, and he was playing, all alone, in<br/>the fair meadow called Goodman's Fields, when a dwarf only a foot<br/>high, with long red whiskers and a humped back, appeared to him<br/>suddenly and said, "Dig by that stump." &#160;He did so, and found<br/>twelve bright new pennies—wonderful riches! &#160;Yet this was not<br/>the best of it; for the dwarf said—<br/><br/>"I know thee. &#160;Thou art a good lad, and a deserving; thy<br/>distresses shall end, for the day of thy reward is come. &#160;Dig<br/>here every seventh day, and thou shalt find always the same<br/>treasure, twelve bright new pennies. Tell none—keep the<br/>secret."<br/><br/>Then the dwarf vanished, and Tom flew to Offal Court with his<br/>prize, saying to himself, "Every night will I give my father a<br/>penny; he will think I begged it, it will glad his heart, and I<br/>shall no more be beaten. One penny every week the good priest that<br/>teacheth me shall have; mother, Nan, and Bet the other four. We be<br/>done with hunger and rags, now, done with fears and frets and<br/>savage usage."<br/><br/>In his dream he reached his sordid home all out of breath, but<br/>with eyes dancing with grateful enthusiasm; cast four of his<br/>pennies into his mother's lap and cried out—<br/><br/>"They are for thee!—all of them, every one!—for thee and Nan and<br/>Bet—and honestly come by, not begged nor stolen!"<br/><br/>The happy and astonished mother strained him to her breast and<br/>exclaimed—<br/><br/>"It waxeth late—may it please your Majesty to rise?"<br/><br/>Ah! that was not the answer he was expecting. &#160;The dream<br/>had snapped asunder—he was awake.<br/><br/>He opened his eyes—the richly clad First Lord of the Bedchamber<br/>was kneeling by his couch. &#160;The gladness of the lying dream<br/>faded away—the poor boy recognised that he was still a captive and<br/>a king. &#160;The room was filled with courtiers clothed in purple<br/>mantles—the mourning colour—and with noble servants of the monarch.<br/>&#160;Tom sat up in bed and gazed out from the heavy silken<br/>curtains upon this fine company.<br/><br/>
