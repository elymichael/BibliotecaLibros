<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>33<br/>Edward as King<br/><br/><br/>Miles Hendon was picturesque enough before he got into the riot<br/>on London Bridge—he was more so when he got out of it. &#160;He had<br/>but little money when he got in, none at all when he got out.<br/>&#160;The pickpockets had stripped him of his last farthing.<br/><br/>But no matter, so he found his boy. &#160;Being a soldier, he<br/>did not go at his task in a random way, but set to work, first of<br/>all, to arrange his campaign.<br/><br/>What would the boy naturally do? &#160;Where would he naturally<br/>go? Well—argued Miles—he would naturally go to his former haunts,<br/>for that is the instinct of unsound minds, when homeless and<br/>forsaken, as well as of sound ones. &#160;Whereabouts were his<br/>former haunts? &#160;His rags, taken together with the low villain<br/>who seemed to know him and who even claimed to be his father,<br/>indicated that his home was in one or another of the poorest and<br/>meanest districts of London. &#160;Would the search for him be<br/>difficult, or long? &#160;No, it was likely to be easy and brief.<br/>&#160;He would not hunt for the boy, he would hunt for a crowd; in<br/>the centre of a big crowd or a little one, sooner or later, he<br/>should find his poor little friend, sure; and the mangy mob would<br/>be entertaining itself with pestering and aggravating the boy, who<br/>would be proclaiming himself King, as usual. &#160;Then Miles<br/>Hendon would cripple some of those people, and carry off his little<br/>ward, and comfort and cheer him with loving words, and the two<br/>would never be separated any more.<br/><br/>So Miles started on his quest. &#160;Hour after hour he tramped<br/>through back alleys and squalid streets, seeking groups and crowds,<br/>and finding no end of them, but never any sign of the boy.<br/>&#160;This greatly surprised him, but did not discourage him.<br/>&#160;To his notion, there was nothing the matter with his plan of<br/>campaign; the only miscalculation about it was that the campaign<br/>was becoming a lengthy one, whereas he had expected it to be<br/>short.<br/><br/>When daylight arrived, at last, he had made many a mile, and<br/>canvassed many a crowd, but the only result was that he was<br/>tolerably tired, rather hungry and very sleepy. &#160;He wanted<br/>some breakfast, but there was no way to get it. &#160;To beg for it<br/>did not occur to him; as to pawning his sword, he would as soon<br/>have thought of parting with his honour; he could spare some of his<br/>clothes—yes, but one could as easily find a customer for a disease<br/>as for such clothes.<br/><br/>At noon he was still tramping—among the rabble which followed<br/>after the royal procession, now; for he argued that this regal<br/>display would attract his little lunatic powerfully. &#160;He<br/>followed the pageant through all its devious windings about London,<br/>and all the way to Westminster and the Abbey. &#160;He drifted here<br/>and there amongst the multitudes that were massed in the vicinity<br/>for a weary long time, baffled and perplexed, and finally wandered<br/>off, thinking, and trying to contrive some way to better his plan<br/>of campaign. &#160;By-and-by, when he came to himself out of his<br/>musings, he discovered that the town was far behind him and that<br/>the day was growing old. &#160;He was near the river, and in the<br/>country; it was a region of fine rural seats—not the sort of<br/>district to welcome clothes like his.<br/><br/>It was not at all cold; so he stretched himself on the ground in<br/>the lee of a hedge to rest and think. &#160;Drowsiness presently<br/>began to settle upon his senses; the faint and far-off boom of<br/>cannon was wafted to his ear, and he said to himself, "The new King<br/>is crowned," and straightway fell asleep. &#160;He had not slept or<br/>rested, before, for more than thirty hours. He did not wake again<br/>until near the middle of the next morning.<br/>
