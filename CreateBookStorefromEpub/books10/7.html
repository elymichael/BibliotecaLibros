<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>2<br/>Tom's early life<br/><br/><br/>Let us skip a number of years.<br/><br/>London was fifteen hundred years old, and was a great town—for<br/>that day. It had a hundred thousand inhabitants—some think double<br/>as many. &#160;The streets were very narrow, and crooked, and<br/>dirty, especially in the part where Tom Canty lived, which was not<br/>far from London Bridge. &#160;The houses were of wood, with the<br/>second story projecting over the first, and the third sticking its<br/>elbows out beyond the second. &#160;The higher the houses grew, the<br/>broader they grew. &#160;They were skeletons of strong criss-cross<br/>beams, with solid material between, coated with plaster. &#160;The<br/>beams were painted red or blue or black, according to the owner's<br/>taste, and this gave the houses a very picturesque look. &#160;The<br/>windows were small, glazed with little diamond-shaped panes, and<br/>they opened outward, on hinges, like doors.<br/><br/>The house which Tom's father lived in was up a foul little<br/>pocket called Offal Court, out of Pudding Lane. &#160;It was small,<br/>decayed, and rickety, but it was packed full of wretchedly poor<br/>families. Canty's tribe occupied a room on the third floor.<br/>&#160;The mother and father had a sort of bedstead in the corner;<br/>but Tom, his grandmother, and his two sisters, Bet and Nan, were<br/>not restricted—they had all the floor to themselves, and might<br/>sleep where they chose. &#160;There were the remains of a blanket<br/>or two, and some bundles of ancient and dirty straw, but these<br/>could not rightly be called beds, for they were not organised; they<br/>were kicked into a general pile, mornings, and selections made from<br/>the mass at night, for service.<br/><br/>Bet and Nan were fifteen years old—twins. &#160;They were<br/>good-hearted girls, unclean, clothed in rags, and profoundly<br/>ignorant. &#160;Their mother was like them. &#160;But the father<br/>and the grandmother were a couple of fiends. &#160;They got drunk<br/>whenever they could; then they fought each other or anybody else<br/>who came in the way; they cursed and swore always, drunk or sober;<br/>John Canty was a thief, and his mother a beggar. &#160;They made<br/>beggars of the children, but failed to make thieves of them.<br/>&#160;Among, but not of, the dreadful rabble that inhabited the<br/>house, was a good old priest whom the King had turned out of house<br/>and home with a pension of a few farthings, and he used to get the<br/>children aside and teach them right ways secretly. Father Andrew<br/>also taught Tom a little Latin, and how to read and write; and<br/>would have done the same with the girls, but they were afraid of<br/>the jeers of their friends, who could not have endured such a queer<br/>accomplishment in them.<br/><br/>All Offal Court was just such another hive as Canty's house.<br/>Drunkenness, riot and brawling were the order, there, every night<br/>and nearly all night long. &#160;Broken heads were as common as<br/>hunger in that place. &#160;Yet little Tom was not unhappy.<br/>&#160;He had a hard time of it, but did not know it. &#160;It was<br/>the sort of time that all the Offal Court boys had, therefore he<br/>supposed it was the correct and comfortable thing. &#160;When he<br/>came home empty-handed at night, he knew his father would curse him<br/>and thrash him first, and that when he was done the awful<br/>grandmother would do it all over again and improve on it; and that<br/>away in the night his starving mother would slip to him stealthily<br/>with any miserable scrap or crust she had been able to save for him<br/>by going hungry herself, notwithstanding she was often caught in<br/>that sort of treason and soundly beaten for it by her husband.<br/><br/>No, Tom's life went along well enough, especially in summer.<br/>&#160;He only begged just enough to save himself, for the laws<br/>against mendicancy were stringent, and the penalties heavy; so he<br/>put in a good deal of his time listening to good Father Andrew's<br/>charming old tales and legends about giants and fairies, dwarfs and<br/>genii, and enchanted castles, and gorgeous kings and princes.<br/>&#160;His head grew to be full of these wonderful things, and many<br/>a night as he lay in the dark on his scant and offensive straw,<br/>tired, hungry, and smarting from a thrashing, he unleashed his<br/>imagination and soon forgot his aches and pains in delicious<br/>picturings to himself of the charmed life of a petted prince in a<br/>regal palace. &#160;One desire came in time to haunt him day and<br/>night: &#160;it was to see a real prince, with his own eyes.<br/>&#160;He spoke of it once to some of his Offal Court comrades; but<br/>they jeered him and scoffed him so unmercifully that he was glad to<br/>keep his dream to himself after that.<br/><br/>He often read the priest's old books and got him to explain and<br/>enlarge upon them. &#160;His dreamings and readings worked certain<br/>changes in him, by- and-by. &#160;His dream-people were so fine<br/>that he grew to lament his shabby clothing and his dirt, and to<br/>wish to be clean and better clad. &#160;He went on playing in the<br/>mud just the same, and enjoying it, too; but, instead of splashing<br/>around in the Thames solely for the fun of it, he began to find an<br/>added value in it because of the washings and cleansings it<br/>afforded.<br/>
