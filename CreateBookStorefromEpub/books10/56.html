<br/>The King spoke—in a thoughtful, measured voice—<br/><br/>"Thou didst save me injury and shame, perchance my life, and so<br/>my crown. Such service demandeth rich reward. &#160;Name thy<br/>desire, and so it be within the compass of my royal power, it is<br/>thine."<br/><br/>This fantastic suggestion startled Hendon out of his reverie.<br/>&#160;He was about to thank the King and put the matter aside with<br/>saying he had only done his duty and desired no reward, but a wiser<br/>thought came into his head, and he asked leave to be silent a few<br/>moments and consider the gracious offer—an idea which the King<br/>gravely approved, remarking that it was best to be not too hasty<br/>with a thing of such great import.<br/><br/>Miles reflected during some moments, then said to himself, "Yes,<br/>that is the thing to do—by any other means it were impossible to<br/>get at it—and certes, this hour's experience has taught me 'twould<br/>be most wearing and inconvenient to continue it as it is. Yes, I<br/>will propose it; 'twas a happy accident that I did not throw the<br/>chance away." &#160;Then he dropped upon one knee and said—<br/><br/>"My poor service went not beyond the limit of a subject's simple<br/>duty, and therefore hath no merit; but since your Majesty is<br/>pleased to hold it worthy some reward, I take heart of grace to<br/>make petition to this effect. &#160;Near four hundred years ago, as<br/>your grace knoweth, there being ill blood betwixt John, King of<br/>England, and the King of France, it was decreed that two champions<br/>should fight together in the lists, and so settle the dispute by<br/>what is called the arbitrament of God. &#160;These two kings, and<br/>the Spanish king, being assembled to witness and judge the<br/>conflict, the French champion appeared; but so redoubtable was he,<br/>that our English knights refused to measure weapons with him.<br/>&#160;So the matter, which was a weighty one, was like to go<br/>against the English monarch by default. &#160;Now in the Tower lay<br/>the Lord de Courcy, the mightiest arm in England, stripped of his<br/>honours and possessions, and wasting with long captivity.<br/>&#160;Appeal was made to him; he gave assent, and came forth<br/>arrayed for battle; but no sooner did the Frenchman glimpse his<br/>huge frame and hear his famous name but he fled away, and the<br/>French king's cause was lost. &#160;King John restored De Courcy's<br/>titles and possessions, and said, 'Name thy wish and thou shalt<br/>have it, though it cost me half my kingdom;' whereat De Courcy,<br/>kneeling, as I do now, made answer, 'This, then, I ask, my liege;<br/>that I and my successors may have and hold the privilege of<br/>remaining covered in the presence of the kings of England,<br/>henceforth while the throne shall last.' The boon was granted, as<br/>your Majesty knoweth; and there hath been no time, these four<br/>hundred years, that that line has failed of an heir; and so, even<br/>unto this day, the head of that ancient house still weareth his hat<br/>or helm before the King's Majesty, without let or hindrance, and<br/>this none other may do. Invoking this precedent in aid of my<br/>prayer, I beseech the King to grant to me but this one grace and<br/>privilege—to my more than sufficient reward—and none other, to wit:<br/>&#160;that I and my heirs, for ever, may SIT in the presence of the<br/>Majesty of England!"<br/><br/>"Rise, Sir Miles Hendon, Knight," said the King, gravely—giving<br/>the accolade with Hendon's sword—"rise, and seat thyself. &#160;Thy<br/>petition is granted. &#160;Whilst England remains, and the crown<br/>continues, the privilege shall not lapse."<br/><br/>His Majesty walked apart, musing, and Hendon dropped into a<br/>chair at table, observing to himself, "'Twas a brave thought, and<br/>hath wrought me a mighty deliverance; my legs are grievously<br/>wearied. An I had not thought of that, I must have had to stand for<br/>weeks, till my poor lad's wits are cured." &#160;After a little, he<br/>went on, "And so I am become a knight of the Kingdom of Dreams and<br/>Shadows! A most odd and strange position, truly, for one so<br/>matter-of-fact as I. &#160;I will not laugh—no, God forbid, for<br/>this thing which is so substanceless to me is REAL to him.<br/>&#160;And to me, also, in one way, it is not a falsity, for it<br/>reflects with truth the sweet and generous spirit that is in him."<br/>&#160;After a pause: "Ah, what if he should call me by my fine<br/>title before folk!—there'd be a merry contrast betwixt my glory and<br/>my raiment! &#160;But no matter, let him call me what he will, so<br/>it please him; I shall be content."<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
