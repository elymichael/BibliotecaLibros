<br/>"I crave your indulgence: &#160;my nose itcheth cruelly.<br/>&#160;What is the custom and usage in this emergence?<br/>&#160;Prithee, speed, for 'tis but a little time that I can bear<br/>it."<br/><br/>None smiled; but all were sore perplexed, and looked one to the<br/>other in deep tribulation for counsel. &#160;But behold, here was a<br/>dead wall, and nothing in English history to tell how to get over<br/>it. &#160;The Master of Ceremonies was not present: &#160;there was<br/>no one who felt safe to venture upon this uncharted sea, or risk<br/>the attempt to solve this solemn problem. &#160;Alas! there was no<br/>Hereditary Scratcher. &#160;Meantime the tears had overflowed their<br/>banks, and begun to trickle down Tom's cheeks. &#160;His twitching<br/>nose was pleading more urgently than ever for relief. &#160;At last<br/>nature broke down the barriers of etiquette: &#160;Tom lifted up an<br/>inward prayer for pardon if he was doing wrong, and brought relief<br/>to the burdened hearts of his court by scratching his nose<br/>himself.<br/><br/>His meal being ended, a lord came and held before him a broad,<br/>shallow, golden dish with fragrant rosewater in it, to cleanse his<br/>mouth and fingers with; and my lord the Hereditary Diaperer stood<br/>by with a napkin for his use. &#160;Tom gazed at the dish a puzzled<br/>moment or two, then raised it to his lips, and gravely took a<br/>draught. &#160;Then he returned it to the waiting lord, and<br/>said—<br/><br/>"Nay, it likes me not, my lord: &#160;it hath a pretty flavour,<br/>but it wanteth strength."<br/><br/>This new eccentricity of the prince's ruined mind made all the<br/>hearts about him ache; but the sad sight moved none to<br/>merriment.<br/><br/>Tom's next unconscious blunder was to get up and leave the table<br/>just when the chaplain had taken his stand behind his chair, and<br/>with uplifted hands, and closed, uplifted eyes, was in the act of<br/>beginning the blessing. &#160;Still nobody seemed to perceive that<br/>the prince had done a thing unusual.<br/><br/>By his own request our small friend was now conducted to his<br/>private cabinet, and left there alone to his own devices.<br/>&#160;Hanging upon hooks in the oaken wainscoting were the several<br/>pieces of a suit of shining steel armour, covered all over with<br/>beautiful designs exquisitely inlaid in gold. &#160;This martial<br/>panoply belonged to the true prince—a recent present from Madam<br/>Parr the Queen. Tom put on the greaves, the gauntlets, the plumed<br/>helmet, and such other pieces as he could don without assistance,<br/>and for a while was minded to call for help and complete the<br/>matter, but bethought him of the nuts he had brought away from<br/>dinner, and the joy it would be to eat them with no crowd to eye<br/>him, and no Grand Hereditaries to pester him with undesired<br/>services; so he restored the pretty things to their several places,<br/>and soon was cracking nuts, and feeling almost naturally happy for<br/>the first time since God for his sins had made him a prince.<br/>&#160;When the nuts were all gone, he stumbled upon some inviting<br/>books in a closet, among them one about the etiquette of the<br/>English court. &#160;This was a prize. He lay down upon a sumptuous<br/>divan, and proceeded to instruct himself with honest zeal.<br/>&#160;Let us leave him there for the present.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
