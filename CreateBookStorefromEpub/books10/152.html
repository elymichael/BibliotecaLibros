He would have been obeyed, but the mock-King stamped his foot<br/>and cried out—<br/><br/>"On your peril! &#160;Touch him not, he is the King!"<br/><br/>The hands were withheld; a paralysis fell upon the house; no one<br/>moved, no one spoke; indeed, no one knew how to act or what to say,<br/>in so strange and surprising an emergency. &#160;While all minds<br/>were struggling to right themselves, the boy still moved steadily<br/>forward, with high port and confident mien; he had never halted<br/>from the beginning; and while the tangled minds still floundered<br/>helplessly, he stepped upon the platform, and the mock-King ran<br/>with a glad face to meet him; and fell on his knees before him and<br/>said—<br/><br/>"Oh, my lord the King, let poor Tom Canty be first to swear<br/>fealty to thee, and say, 'Put on thy crown and enter into thine own<br/>again!'"<br/><br/>The Lord Protector's eye fell sternly upon the new-comer's face;<br/>but straightway the sternness vanished away, and gave place to an<br/>expression of wondering surprise. &#160;This thing happened also to<br/>the other great officers. &#160;They glanced at each other, and<br/>retreated a step by a common and unconscious impulse. &#160;The<br/>thought in each mind was the same: &#160;"What a strange<br/>resemblance!"<br/><br/>The Lord Protector reflected a moment or two in perplexity, then<br/>he said, with grave respectfulness—<br/><br/>"By your favour, sir, I desire to ask certain questions<br/>which—"<br/><br/>"I will answer them, my lord."<br/><br/>The Duke asked him many questions about the Court, the late<br/>King, the prince, the princesses—the boy answered them correctly<br/>and without hesitating. &#160;He described the rooms of state in<br/>the palace, the late King's apartments, and those of the Prince of<br/>Wales.<br/><br/>It was strange; it was wonderful; yes, it was unaccountable—so<br/>all said that heard it. &#160;The tide was beginning to turn, and<br/>Tom Canty's hopes to run high, when the Lord Protector shook his<br/>head and said—<br/><br/>"It is true it is most wonderful—but it is no more than our lord<br/>the King likewise can do." &#160;This remark, and this reference to<br/>himself as still the King, saddened Tom Canty, and he felt his<br/>hopes crumbling from under him. &#160;"These are not PROOFS," added<br/>the Protector.<br/>
