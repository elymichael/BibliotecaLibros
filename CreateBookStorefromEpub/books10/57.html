<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>13<br/>The disappearance of the Prince<br/><br/><br/>A heavy drowsiness presently fell upon the two comrades.<br/>&#160;The King said—<br/><br/>"Remove these rags."—meaning his clothing.<br/><br/>Hendon disapparelled the boy without dissent or remark, tucked<br/>him up in bed, then glanced about the room, saying to himself,<br/>ruefully, "He hath taken my bed again, as before—marry, what shall<br/>_I_ do?" &#160;The little King observed his perplexity, and<br/>dissipated it with a word. &#160;He said, sleepily—<br/><br/>"Thou wilt sleep athwart the door, and guard it." &#160;In a<br/>moment more he was out of his troubles, in a deep slumber.<br/><br/>"Dear heart, he should have been born a king!" muttered Hendon,<br/>admiringly; "he playeth the part to a marvel."<br/><br/>Then he stretched himself across the door, on the floor, saying<br/>contentedly—<br/><br/>"I have lodged worse for seven years; 'twould be but ill<br/>gratitude to Him above to find fault with this."<br/>
