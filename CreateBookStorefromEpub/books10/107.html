<br/>"Mayhap it was. &#160;Yes, doubtless that was it. &#160;I have<br/>been hearing it faintly all the—there it is again! &#160;It is not<br/>the wind! &#160;What an odd sound! &#160;Come, we will hunt it<br/>out!"<br/><br/>Now the King's joy was nearly insupportable. &#160;His tired<br/>lungs did their utmost—and hopefully, too—but the sealed jaws and<br/>the muffling sheepskin sadly crippled the effort. &#160;Then the<br/>poor fellow's heart sank, to hear the hermit say—<br/><br/>"Ah, it came from without—I think from the copse yonder.<br/>&#160;Come, I will lead the way."<br/><br/>The King heard the two pass out, talking; heard their footsteps<br/>die quickly away—then he was alone with a boding, brooding, awful<br/>silence.<br/><br/>It seemed an age till he heard the steps and voices approaching<br/>again—and this time he heard an added sound,—the trampling of<br/>hoofs, apparently. &#160;Then he heard Hendon say—<br/><br/>"I will not wait longer. &#160;I CANNOT wait longer. &#160;He<br/>has lost his way in this thick wood. &#160;Which direction took he?<br/>&#160;Quick—point it out to me."<br/><br/>"He—but wait; I will go with thee."<br/><br/>"Good—good! &#160;Why, truly thou art better than thy looks.<br/>&#160;Marry I do not think there's not another archangel with so<br/>right a heart as thine. &#160;Wilt ride? &#160;Wilt take the wee<br/>donkey that's for my boy, or wilt thou fork thy holy legs over this<br/>ill-conditioned slave of a mule that I have provided for<br/>myself?—and had been cheated in too, had he cost but the<br/>indifferent sum of a month's usury on a brass farthing let to a<br/>tinker out of work."<br/><br/>"No—ride thy mule, and lead thine ass; I am surer on mine own<br/>feet, and will walk."<br/><br/>"Then prithee mind the little beast for me while I take my life<br/>in my hands and make what success I may toward mounting the big<br/>one."<br/><br/>
