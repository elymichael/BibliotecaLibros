<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>29<br/>To London<br/><br/><br/>When Hendon's term of service in the stocks was finished, he was<br/>released and ordered to quit the region and come back no more. His<br/>sword was restored to him, and also his mule and his donkey. He<br/>mounted and rode off, followed by the King, the crowd opening with<br/>quiet respectfulness to let them pass, and then dispersing when<br/>they were gone.<br/><br/>Hendon was soon absorbed in thought. &#160;There were questions<br/>of high import to be answered. &#160;What should he do?<br/>&#160;Whither should he go? Powerful help must be found somewhere,<br/>or he must relinquish his inheritance and remain under the<br/>imputation of being an impostor besides. &#160;Where could he hope<br/>to find this powerful help? &#160;Where, indeed! &#160;It was a<br/>knotty question. By-and-by a thought occurred to him which pointed<br/>to a possibility—the slenderest of slender possibilities,<br/>certainly, but still worth considering, for lack of any other that<br/>promised anything at all. &#160;He remembered what old Andrews had<br/>said about the young King's goodness and his generous championship<br/>of the wronged and unfortunate. &#160;Why not go and try to get<br/>speech of him and beg for justice? &#160;Ah, yes, but could so<br/>fantastic a pauper get admission to the august presence of a<br/>monarch? Never mind—let that matter take care of itself; it was a<br/>bridge that would not need to be crossed till he should come to it.<br/>&#160;He was an old campaigner, and used to inventing shifts and<br/>expedients: &#160;no doubt he would be able to find a way.<br/>&#160;Yes, he would strike for the capital. Maybe his father's old<br/>friend Sir Humphrey Marlow would help him—'good old Sir Humphrey,<br/>Head Lieutenant of the late King's kitchen, or stables, or<br/>something'—Miles could not remember just what or which. &#160;Now<br/>that he had something to turn his energies to, a distinctly defined<br/>object to accomplish, the fog of humiliation and depression which<br/>had settled down upon his spirits lifted and blew away, and he<br/>raised his head and looked about him. &#160;He was surprised to see<br/>how far he had come; the village was away behind him. &#160;The<br/>King was jogging along in his wake, with his head bowed; for he,<br/>too, was deep in plans and thinkings. &#160;A sorrowful misgiving<br/>clouded Hendon's new-born cheerfulness: &#160;would the boy be<br/>willing to go again to a city where, during all his brief life, he<br/>had never known anything but ill-usage and pinching want? &#160;But<br/>the question must be asked; it could not be avoided; so Hendon<br/>reined up, and called out—<br/><br/>"I had forgotten to inquire whither we are bound. &#160;Thy<br/>commands, my liege!"<br/><br/>"To London!"<br/><br/>Hendon moved on again, mightily contented with the answer—but<br/>astounded at it too.<br/><br/>The whole journey was made without an adventure of importance.<br/>But it ended with one. &#160;About ten o'clock on the night of the<br/>19th of February they stepped upon London Bridge, in the midst of a<br/>writhing, struggling jam of howling and hurrahing people, whose<br/>beer-jolly faces stood out strongly in the glare from manifold<br/>torches—and at that instant the decaying head of some former duke<br/>or other grandee tumbled down between them, striking Hendon on the<br/>elbow and then bounding off among the hurrying confusion of feet.<br/>So evanescent and unstable are men's works in this world!—the late<br/>good King is but three weeks dead and three days in his grave, and<br/>already the adornments which he took such pains to select from<br/>prominent people for his noble bridge are falling. &#160;A citizen<br/>stumbled over that head, and drove his own head into the back of<br/>somebody in front of him, who turned and knocked down the first<br/>person that came handy, and was promptly laid out himself by that<br/>person's friend. &#160;It was the right ripe time for a free fight,<br/>for the festivities of the morrow—Coronation Day—were already<br/>beginning; everybody was full of strong drink and patriotism;<br/>within five minutes the free fight was occupying a good deal of<br/>ground; within ten or twelve it covered an acre of so, and was<br/>become a riot. &#160;By this time Hendon and the King were<br/>hopelessly separated from each other and lost in the rush and<br/>turmoil of the roaring masses of humanity. &#160;And so we leave<br/>them.<br/><br/><br/>
