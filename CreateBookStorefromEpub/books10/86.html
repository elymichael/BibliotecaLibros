<br/><br/>Conversation followed; not in the thieves' dialect of the song,<br/>for that was only used in talk when unfriendly ears might be<br/>listening. &#160;In the course of it, it appeared that 'John Hobbs'<br/>was not altogether a new recruit, but had trained in the gang at<br/>some former time. &#160;His later history was called for, and when<br/>he said he had 'accidentally' killed a man, considerable<br/>satisfaction was expressed; when he added that the man was a<br/>priest, he was roundly applauded, and had to take a drink with<br/>everybody. &#160;Old acquaintances welcomed him joyously, and new<br/>ones were proud to shake him by the hand. &#160;He was asked why he<br/>had 'tarried away so many months.' &#160;He answered—<br/><br/>"London is better than the country, and safer, these late years,<br/>the laws be so bitter and so diligently enforced. &#160;An' I had<br/>not had that accident, I had stayed there. &#160;I had resolved to<br/>stay, and never more venture country-wards—but the accident has<br/>ended that."<br/><br/>He inquired how many persons the gang numbered now. &#160;The<br/>'ruffler,' or chief, answered—<br/><br/>"Five and twenty sturdy budges, bulks, files, clapperdogeons and<br/>maunders, counting the dells and doxies and other morts. Most are<br/>here, the rest are wandering eastward, along the winter lay. We<br/>follow at dawn."<br/><br/>"I do not see the Wen among the honest folk about me.<br/>&#160;Where may he be?"<br/><br/>"Poor lad, his diet is brimstone, now, and over hot for a<br/>delicate taste. He was killed in a brawl, somewhere about<br/>midsummer."<br/><br/>"I sorrow to hear that; the Wen was a capable man, and<br/>brave."<br/><br/>"That was he, truly. &#160;Black Bess, his dell, is of us yet,<br/>but absent on the eastward tramp; a fine lass, of nice ways and<br/>orderly conduct, none ever seeing her drunk above four days in the<br/>seven."<br/><br/>"She was ever strict—I remember it well—a goodly wench and<br/>worthy all commendation. &#160;Her mother was more free and less<br/>particular; a troublesome and ugly-tempered beldame, but furnished<br/>with a wit above the common."<br/><br/>"We lost her through it. &#160;Her gift of palmistry and other<br/>sorts of fortune-telling begot for her at last a witch's name and<br/>fame. The law roasted her to death at a slow fire. &#160;It did<br/>touch me to a sort of tenderness to see the gallant way she met her<br/>lot—cursing and reviling all the crowd that gaped and gazed around<br/>her, whilst the flames licked upward toward her face and catched<br/>her thin locks and crackled about her old gray head—cursing them!<br/>why an' thou should'st live a thousand years thoud'st never hear so<br/>masterful a cursing. &#160;Alack, her art died with her.<br/>&#160;There be base and weakling imitations left, but no true<br/>blasphemy."<br/>
