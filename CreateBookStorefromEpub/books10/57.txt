The disappearance of the Prince


A heavy drowsiness presently fell upon the two comrades.
&#160;The King said—

"Remove these rags."—meaning his clothing.

Hendon disapparelled the boy without dissent or remark, tucked
him up in bed, then glanced about the room, saying to himself,
ruefully, "He hath taken my bed again, as before—marry, what shall
_I_ do?" &#160;The little King observed his perplexity, and
dissipated it with a word. &#160;He said, sleepily—

"Thou wilt sleep athwart the door, and guard it." &#160;In a
moment more he was out of his troubles, in a deep slumber.

"Dear heart, he should have been born a king!" muttered Hendon,
admiringly; "he playeth the part to a marvel."

Then he stretched himself across the door, on the floor, saying
contentedly—

"I have lodged worse for seven years; 'twould be but ill
gratitude to Him above to find fault with this."
