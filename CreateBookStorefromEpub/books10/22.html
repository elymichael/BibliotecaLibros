<br/>Tom's breath was nearly failing him; but he made shift to<br/>stammer out—<br/><br/>"Ah, be merciful, thou! &#160;In sooth I am no lord, but only<br/>poor Tom Canty of Offal Court in the city. &#160;Prithee let me see<br/>the prince, and he will of his grace restore to me my rags, and let<br/>me hence unhurt. &#160;Oh, be thou merciful, and save me!"<br/><br/>By this time the boy was on his knees, and supplicating with his<br/>eyes and uplifted hands as well as with his tongue. &#160;The young<br/>girl seemed horror-stricken. &#160;She cried out—<br/><br/>"O my lord, on thy knees?—and to ME!"<br/><br/>Then she fled away in fright; and Tom, smitten with despair,<br/>sank down, murmuring—<br/><br/>"There is no help, there is no hope. &#160;Now will they come<br/>and take me."<br/><br/>Whilst he lay there benumbed with terror, dreadful tidings were<br/>speeding through the palace. &#160;The whisper—for it was whispered<br/>always—flew from menial to menial, from lord to lady, down all the<br/>long corridors, from story to story, from saloon to saloon, "The<br/>prince hath gone mad, the prince hath gone mad!" &#160;Soon every<br/>saloon, every marble hall, had its groups of glittering lords and<br/>ladies, and other groups of dazzling lesser folk, talking earnestly<br/>together in whispers, and every face had in it dismay. Presently a<br/>splendid official came marching by these groups, making solemn<br/>proclamation—<br/><br/>"IN THE NAME OF THE KING!<br/><br/>Let none list to this false and foolish matter, upon pain of<br/>death, nor discuss the same, nor carry it abroad. &#160;In the name<br/>of the King!"<br/><br/>The whisperings ceased as suddenly as if the whisperers had been<br/>stricken dumb.<br/><br/>
