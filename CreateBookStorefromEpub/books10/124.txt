"I pray heaven it may prove so, and that other eyes may find the
resemblances that are hid from mine. &#160;Alack, I fear me the
letter spoke but too truly."

"What letter?"

"One that came from over sea, some six or seven years ago.
&#160;It said my brother died in battle."

"It was a lie! &#160;Call thy father—he will know me."

"One may not call the dead."

"Dead?" Miles's voice was subdued, and his lips trembled.
&#160;"My father dead!—oh, this is heavy news. &#160;Half my new
joy is withered now. &#160;Prithee let me see my brother Arthur—he
will know me; he will know me and console me."

"He, also, is dead."

"God be merciful to me, a stricken man! &#160;Gone,—both
gone—the worthy taken and the worthless spared, in me! &#160;Ah! I
crave your mercy!—do not say the Lady Edith—"

"Is dead? &#160;No, she lives."

"Then, God be praised, my joy is whole again! &#160;Speed thee,
brother—let her come to me! &#160;An' SHE say I am not myself—but
she will not; no, no, SHE will know me, I were a fool to doubt it.
Bring her—bring the old servants; they, too, will know me."
