<br/>"O my lord the King, an' thou canst pity the lost, have pity<br/>upon me! &#160;I am innocent—neither hath that wherewith I am<br/>charged been more than but lamely proved—yet I speak not of that;<br/>the judgment is gone forth against me and may not suffer<br/>alteration; yet in mine extremity I beg a boon, for my doom is more<br/>than I can bear. A grace, a grace, my lord the King! in thy royal<br/>compassion grant my prayer—give commandment that I be hanged!"<br/><br/>Tom was amazed. &#160;This was not the outcome he had looked<br/>for.<br/><br/>"Odds my life, a strange BOON! &#160;Was it not the fate<br/>intended thee?"<br/><br/>"O good my liege, not so! &#160;It is ordered that I be BOILED<br/>ALIVE!"<br/><br/>The hideous surprise of these words almost made Tom spring from<br/>his chair. &#160;As soon as he could recover his wits he cried<br/>out—<br/><br/>"Have thy wish, poor soul! an' thou had poisoned a hundred men<br/>thou shouldst not suffer so miserable a death."<br/><br/>The prisoner bowed his face to the ground and burst into<br/>passionate expressions of gratitude—ending with—<br/><br/>"If ever thou shouldst know misfortune—which God forefend!—may<br/>thy goodness to me this day be remembered and requited!"<br/><br/>Tom turned to the Earl of Hertford, and said—<br/><br/>"My lord, is it believable that there was warrant for this man's<br/>ferocious doom?"<br/><br/>
