Tom's first royal dinner


Somewhat after one in the afternoon, Tom resignedly underwent
the ordeal of being dressed for dinner. &#160;He found himself as
finely clothed as before, but everything different, everything
changed, from his ruff to his stockings. &#160;He was presently
conducted with much state to a spacious and ornate apartment, where
a table was already set for one. &#160;Its furniture was all of
massy gold, and beautified with designs which well-nigh made it
priceless, since they were the work of Benvenuto. &#160;The room
was half-filled with noble servitors. &#160;A chaplain said grace,
and Tom was about to fall to, for hunger had long been
constitutional with him, but was interrupted by my lord the Earl of
Berkeley, who fastened a napkin about his neck; for the great post
of Diaperers to the Prince of Wales was hereditary in this
nobleman's family. &#160;Tom's cupbearer was present, and
forestalled all his attempts to help himself to wine. &#160;The
Taster to his highness the Prince of Wales was there also, prepared
to taste any suspicious dish upon requirement, and run the risk of
being poisoned. &#160;He was only an ornamental appendage at this
time, and was seldom called upon to exercise his function; but
there had been times, not many generations past, when the office of
taster had its perils, and was not a grandeur to be desired.
&#160;Why they did not use a dog or a plumber seems strange; but
all the ways of royalty are strange. &#160;My Lord d'Arcy, First
Groom of the Chamber, was there, to do goodness knows what; but
there he was—let that suffice. &#160;The Lord Chief Butler was
there, and stood behind Tom's chair, overseeing the solemnities,
under command of the Lord Great Steward and the Lord Head Cook, who
stood near. &#160;Tom had three hundred and eighty-four servants
beside these; but they were not all in that room, of course, nor
the quarter of them; neither was Tom aware yet that they
existed.

All those that were present had been well drilled within the
hour to remember that the prince was temporarily out of his head,
and to be careful to show no surprise at his vagaries. &#160;These
'vagaries' were soon on exhibition before them; but they only moved
their compassion and their sorrow, not their mirth. &#160;It was a
heavy affliction to them to see the beloved prince so stricken.

Poor Tom ate with his fingers mainly; but no one smiled at it,
or even seemed to observe it. &#160;He inspected his napkin
curiously, and with deep interest, for it was of a very dainty and
beautiful fabric, then said with simplicity—

"Prithee, take it away, lest in mine unheedfulness it be
soiled."

The Hereditary Diaperer took it away with reverent manner, and
without word or protest of any sort.

Tom examined the turnips and the lettuce with interest, and
asked what they were, and if they were to be eaten; for it was only
recently that men had begun to raise these things in England in
place of importing them as luxuries from Holland.

&#160;His question was answered with
grave respect, and no surprise manifested. &#160;When he had
finished his dessert, he filled his pockets with nuts; but nobody
appeared to be aware of it, or disturbed by it. &#160;But the next
moment he was himself disturbed by it, and showed discomposure; for
this was the only service he had been permitted to do with his own
hands during the meal, and he did not doubt that he had done a most
improper and unprincely thing. &#160;At that moment the muscles of
his nose began to twitch, and the end of that organ to lift and
wrinkle. &#160;This continued, and Tom began to evince a growing
distress. &#160;He looked appealingly, first at one and then
another of the lords about him, and tears came into his eyes.
&#160;They sprang forward with dismay in their faces, and begged to
know his trouble. &#160;Tom said with genuine anguish—
