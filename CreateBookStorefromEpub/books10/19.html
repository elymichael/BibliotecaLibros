Then followed such a thing as England had never seen before—the<br/>sacred person of the heir to the throne rudely buffeted by plebeian<br/>hands, and set upon and torn by dogs.<br/><br/>As night drew to a close that day, the prince found himself far<br/>down in the close-built portion of the city. &#160;His body was<br/>bruised, his hands were bleeding, and his rags were all besmirched<br/>with mud. &#160;He wandered on and on, and grew more and more<br/>bewildered, and so tired and faint he could hardly drag one foot<br/>after the other. &#160;He had ceased to ask questions of anyone,<br/>since they brought him only insult instead of information. &#160;He<br/>kept muttering to himself, "Offal Court—that is the name; if I can<br/>but find it before my strength is wholly spent and I drop, then am<br/>I saved—for his people will take me to the palace and prove that I<br/>am none of theirs, but the true prince, and I shall have mine own<br/>again." &#160;And now and then his mind reverted to his treatment<br/>by those rude Christ's Hospital boys, and he said, "When I am king,<br/>they shall not have bread and shelter only, but also teachings out<br/>of books; for a full belly is little worth where the mind is<br/>starved, and the heart. &#160;I will keep this diligently in my<br/>remembrance, that this day's lesson be not lost upon me, and my<br/>people suffer thereby; for learning softeneth the heart and<br/>breedeth gentleness and charity."&#160;<br/>[2]<br/><br/>The lights began to twinkle, it came on to rain, the wind rose,<br/>and a raw and gusty night set in. &#160;The houseless prince, the<br/>homeless heir to the throne of England, still moved on, drifting<br/>deeper into the maze of squalid alleys where the swarming hives of<br/>poverty and misery were massed together.<br/><br/>Suddenly a great drunken ruffian collared him and said—<br/><br/>"Out to this time of night again, and hast not brought a<br/>farthing home, I warrant me! &#160;If it be so, an' I do not break<br/>all the bones in thy lean body, then am I not John Canty, but some<br/>other."<br/><br/>The prince twisted himself loose, unconsciously brushed his<br/>profaned shoulder, and eagerly said—<br/><br/>"Oh, art HIS father, truly? &#160;Sweet heaven grant it be<br/>so—then wilt thou fetch him away and restore me!"<br/><br/>"HIS father? &#160;I know not what thou mean'st; I but know I am<br/>THY father, as thou shalt soon have cause to—"<br/><br/>"Oh, jest not, palter not, delay not!—I am worn, I am wounded, I<br/>can bear no more. &#160;Take me to the king my father, and he will<br/>make thee rich beyond thy wildest dreams. &#160;Believe me, man,<br/>believe me!—I speak no lie, but only the truth!—put forth thy hand<br/>and save me! &#160;I am indeed the Prince of Wales!"<br/><br/>The man stared down, stupefied, upon the lad, then shook his<br/>head and muttered—<br/><br/>
