"Sire, the Seal is not there!"<br/><br/>A mob does not melt away from the presence of a plague-patient<br/>with more haste than the band of pallid and terrified courtiers<br/>melted away from the presence of the shabby little claimant of the<br/>Crown. &#160;In a moment he stood all alone, without friend or<br/>supporter, a target upon which was concentrated a bitter fire of<br/>scornful and angry looks. &#160;The Lord Protector called out<br/>fiercely—<br/><br/>"Cast the beggar into the street, and scourge him through the<br/>town—the paltry knave is worth no more consideration!"<br/><br/>Officers of the guard sprang forward to obey, but Tom Canty<br/>waved them off and said—<br/><br/>"Back! &#160;Whoso touches him perils his life!"<br/><br/>The Lord Protector was perplexed in the last degree. &#160;He<br/>said to the Lord St. John—<br/><br/>"Searched you well?—but it boots not to ask that. &#160;It doth<br/>seem passing strange. &#160;Little things, trifles, slip out of<br/>one's ken, and one does not think it matter for surprise; but how<br/>so bulky a thing as the Seal of England can vanish away and no man<br/>be able to get track of it again—a massy golden disk—"<br/><br/>Tom Canty, with beaming eyes, sprang forward and shouted—<br/><br/>"Hold, that is enough! &#160;Was it round?—and thick?—and had it<br/>letters and devices graved upon it?—yes? &#160;Oh, NOW I know what<br/>this Great Seal is that there's been such worry and pother about.<br/>An' ye had described it to me, ye could have had it three weeks<br/>ago. &#160;Right well I know where it lies; but it was not I that<br/>put it there—first."<br/><br/>"Who, then, my liege?" asked the Lord Protector.<br/><br/>"He that stands there—the rightful King of England. &#160;And he<br/>shall tell you himself where it lies—then you will believe he knew<br/>it of his own knowledge. &#160;Bethink thee, my King—spur thy<br/>memory—it was the last, the very LAST thing thou didst that day<br/>before thou didst rush forth from the palace, clothed in my rags,<br/>to punish the soldier that insulted me."<br/>
