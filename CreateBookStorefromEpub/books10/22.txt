Tom's breath was nearly failing him; but he made shift to
stammer out—

"Ah, be merciful, thou! &#160;In sooth I am no lord, but only
poor Tom Canty of Offal Court in the city. &#160;Prithee let me see
the prince, and he will of his grace restore to me my rags, and let
me hence unhurt. &#160;Oh, be thou merciful, and save me!"

By this time the boy was on his knees, and supplicating with his
eyes and uplifted hands as well as with his tongue. &#160;The young
girl seemed horror-stricken. &#160;She cried out—

"O my lord, on thy knees?—and to ME!"

Then she fled away in fright; and Tom, smitten with despair,
sank down, murmuring—

"There is no help, there is no hope. &#160;Now will they come
and take me."

Whilst he lay there benumbed with terror, dreadful tidings were
speeding through the palace. &#160;The whisper—for it was whispered
always—flew from menial to menial, from lord to lady, down all the
long corridors, from story to story, from saloon to saloon, "The
prince hath gone mad, the prince hath gone mad!" &#160;Soon every
saloon, every marble hall, had its groups of glittering lords and
ladies, and other groups of dazzling lesser folk, talking earnestly
together in whispers, and every face had in it dismay. Presently a
splendid official came marching by these groups, making solemn
proclamation—

"IN THE NAME OF THE KING!

Let none list to this false and foolish matter, upon pain of
death, nor discuss the same, nor carry it abroad. &#160;In the name
of the King!"

The whisperings ceased as suddenly as if the whisperers had been
stricken dumb.
