The great assemblage bent their heads upon their breasts with<br/>one accord; remained so, in profound silence, a few moments; then<br/>all sank upon their knees in a body, stretched out their hands<br/>toward Tom, and a mighty shout burst forth that seemed to shake the<br/>building—<br/><br/>"Long live the King!"<br/><br/>Poor Tom's dazed eyes wandered abroad over this stupefying<br/>spectacle, and finally rested dreamily upon the kneeling princesses<br/>beside him, a moment, then upon the Earl of Hertford. A sudden<br/>purpose dawned in his face. &#160;He said, in a low tone, at Lord<br/>Hertford's ear—<br/><br/>"Answer me truly, on thy faith and honour! &#160;Uttered I here<br/>a command, the which none but a king might hold privilege and<br/>prerogative to utter, would such commandment be obeyed, and none<br/>rise up to say me nay?"<br/><br/>"None, my liege, in all these realms. &#160;In thy person bides<br/>the majesty of England. &#160;Thou art the king—thy word is<br/>law."<br/><br/>Tom responded, in a strong, earnest voice, and with great<br/>animation—<br/><br/>"Then shall the king's law be law of mercy, from this day, and<br/>never more be law of blood! &#160;Up from thy knees and away!<br/>&#160;To the Tower, and say the King decrees the Duke of Norfolk<br/>shall not die!"<br/><br/>The words were caught up and carried eagerly from lip to lip far<br/>and wide over the hall, and as Hertford hurried from the presence,<br/>another prodigious shout burst forth—<br/><br/>"The reign of blood is ended! &#160;Long live Edward, King of<br/>England!"<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
