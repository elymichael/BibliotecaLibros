Lord Hertford said—<br/><br/>"So please your highness, it is for you to command, it is for us<br/>to obey. That thou should'st rest is indeed a needful thing, since<br/>thou must journey to the city presently."<br/><br/>He touched a bell, and a page appeared, who was ordered to<br/>desire the presence of Sir William Herbert. &#160;This gentleman<br/>came straightway, and conducted Tom to an inner apartment.<br/>&#160;Tom's first movement there was to reach for a cup of water;<br/>but a silk-and-velvet servitor seized it, dropped upon one knee,<br/>and offered it to him on a golden salver.<br/><br/>Next the tired captive sat down and was going to take off his<br/>buskins, timidly asking leave with his eye, but another<br/>silk-and-velvet discomforter went down upon his knees and took the<br/>office from him. &#160;He made two or three further efforts to help<br/>himself, but being promptly forestalled each time, he finally gave<br/>up, with a sigh of resignation and a murmured "Beshrew me, but I<br/>marvel they do not require to breathe for me also!"<br/>&#160;Slippered, and wrapped in a sumptuous robe, he laid himself<br/>down at last to rest, but not to sleep, for his head was too full<br/>of thoughts and the room too full of people. &#160;He could not<br/>dismiss the former, so they stayed; he did not know enough to<br/>dismiss the latter, so they stayed also, to his vast regret—and<br/>theirs.<br/><br/>Tom's departure had left his two noble guardians alone.<br/>&#160;They mused a while, with much head-shaking and walking the<br/>floor, then Lord St. John said—<br/><br/>"Plainly, what dost thou think?"<br/><br/>"Plainly, then, this. &#160;The King is near his end; my nephew<br/>is mad—mad will mount the throne, and mad remain. &#160;God protect<br/>England, since she will need it!"<br/><br/>"Verily it promiseth so, indeed. &#160;But&#160;… have you no<br/>misgivings as to&#160;… as to&#160;… "<br/><br/>The speaker hesitated, and finally stopped. &#160;He evidently<br/>felt that he was upon delicate ground. &#160;Lord Hertford stopped<br/>before him, looked into his face with a clear, frank eye, and<br/>said—<br/><br/>"Speak on—there is none to hear but me. &#160;Misgivings as to<br/>what?"<br/><br/>"I am full loth to word the thing that is in my mind, and thou<br/>so near to him in blood, my lord. &#160;But craving pardon if I do<br/>offend, seemeth it not strange that madness could so change his<br/>port and manner?—not but that his port and speech are princely<br/>still, but that they DIFFER, in one unweighty trifle or another,<br/>from what his custom was aforetime. &#160;Seemeth it not strange<br/>that madness should filch from his memory his father's very<br/>lineaments; the customs and observances that are his due from such<br/>as be about him; and, leaving him his Latin, strip him of his Greek<br/>and French? &#160;My lord, be not offended, but ease my mind of its<br/>disquiet and receive my grateful thanks. &#160;It haunteth me, his<br/>saying he was not the prince, and so—"<br/>
