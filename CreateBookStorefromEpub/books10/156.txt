"Now, O my King, take these regal garments back, and give poor
Tom, thy servant, his shreds and remnants again."

"I will not have it so. &#160;But for him I had not got my crown
again—none shall lay a hand upon him to harm him. &#160;And as for
thee, my good uncle, my Lord Protector, this conduct of thine is
not grateful toward this poor lad, for I hear he hath made thee a
duke"—the Protector blushed—"yet he was not a king; wherefore what
is thy fine title worth now? &#160;To-morrow you shall sue to me,
THROUGH HIM, for its confirmation, else no duke, but a simple earl,
shalt thou remain."

where I hid the Seal when I could not remember it myself?"

"Ah, my King, that was easy, since I used it divers days."

"Used it—yet could not explain where it was?"

"I did not know it was THAT they wanted. &#160;They did not
describe it, your Majesty."

"Then how used you it?"
