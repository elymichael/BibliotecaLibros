"If thou art truly the King, then I believe thee."<br/><br/>"I am truly the King."<br/><br/>This settled the matter. &#160;His Majesty's royalty was<br/>accepted without further question or discussion, and the two little<br/>girls began at once to inquire into how he came to be where he was,<br/>and how he came to be so unroyally clad, and whither he was bound,<br/>and all about his affairs. &#160;It was a mighty relief to him to<br/>pour out his troubles where they would not be scoffed at or<br/>doubted; so he told his tale with feeling, forgetting even his<br/>hunger for the time; and it was received with the deepest and<br/>tenderest sympathy by the gentle little maids. &#160;But when he<br/>got down to his latest experiences and they learned how long he had<br/>been without food, they cut him short and hurried him away to the<br/>farmhouse to find a breakfast for him.<br/><br/>The King was cheerful and happy now, and said to himself, "When<br/>I am come to mine own again, I will always honour little children,<br/>remembering how that these trusted me and believed in me in my time<br/>of trouble; whilst they that were older, and thought themselves<br/>wiser, mocked at me and held me for a liar."<br/><br/>The children's mother received the King kindly, and was full of<br/>pity; for his forlorn condition and apparently crazed intellect<br/>touched her womanly heart. &#160;She was a widow, and rather poor;<br/>consequently she had seen trouble enough to enable her to feel for<br/>the unfortunate. &#160;She imagined that the demented boy had<br/>wandered away from his friends or keepers; so she tried to find out<br/>whence he had come, in order that she might take measures to return<br/>him; but all her references to neighbouring towns and villages, and<br/>all her inquiries in the same line went for nothing—the boy's face,<br/>and his answers, too, showed that the things she was talking of<br/>were not familiar to him. &#160;He spoke earnestly and simply about<br/>court matters, and broke down, more than once, when speaking of the<br/>late King 'his father'; but whenever the conversation changed to<br/>baser topics, he lost interest and became silent.<br/><br/>The woman was mightily puzzled; but she did not give up.<br/>&#160;As she proceeded with her cooking, she set herself to<br/>contriving devices to surprise the boy into betraying his real<br/>secret. &#160;She talked about cattle—he showed no concern; then<br/>about sheep—the same result: &#160;so her guess that he had been a<br/>shepherd boy was an error; she talked about mills; and about<br/>weavers, tinkers, smiths, trades and tradesmen of all sorts; and<br/>about Bedlam, and jails, and charitable retreats: &#160;but no<br/>matter, she was baffled at all points. &#160;Not altogether,<br/>either; for she argued that she had narrowed the thing down to<br/>domestic service. &#160;Yes, she was sure she was on the right<br/>track, now; he must have been a house servant. &#160;So she led up<br/>to that. &#160;But the result was discouraging. The subject of<br/>sweeping appeared to weary him; fire-building failed to stir him;<br/>scrubbing and scouring awoke no enthusiasm. The goodwife touched,<br/>with a perishing hope, and rather as a matter of form, upon the<br/>subject of cooking. &#160;To her surprise, and her vast delight,<br/>the King's face lighted at once! &#160;Ah, she had hunted him down<br/>at last, she thought; and she was right proud, too, of the devious<br/>shrewdness and tact which had accomplished it.<br/><br/>Her tired tongue got a chance to rest, now; for the King's,<br/>inspired by gnawing hunger and the fragrant smells that came from<br/>the sputtering pots and pans, turned itself loose and delivered<br/>itself up to such an eloquent dissertation upon certain toothsome<br/>dishes, that within three minutes the woman said to herself, "Of a<br/>truth I was right—he hath holpen in a kitchen!" &#160;Then he<br/>broadened his bill of fare, and discussed it with such appreciation<br/>and animation, that the goodwife said to herself, "Good lack! how<br/>can he know so many dishes, and so fine ones withal? &#160;For<br/>these belong only upon the tables of the rich and great. &#160;Ah,<br/>now I see! ragged outcast as he is, he must have served in the<br/>palace before his reason went astray; yes, he must have helped in<br/>the very kitchen of the King himself! &#160;I will test him."<br/><br/>Full of eagerness to prove her sagacity, she told the King to<br/>mind the cooking a moment—hinting that he might manufacture and add<br/>a dish or two, if he chose; then she went out of the room and gave<br/>her children a sign to follow after. &#160;The King muttered—<br/><br/>"Another English king had a commission like to this, in a bygone<br/>time—it is nothing against my dignity to undertake an office which<br/>the great Alfred stooped to assume. &#160;But I will try to better<br/>serve my trust than he; for he let the cakes burn."<br/><br/>The intent was good, but the performance was not answerable to<br/>it, for this King, like the other one, soon fell into deep<br/>thinkings concerning his vast affairs, and the same calamity<br/>resulted—the cookery got burned. The woman returned in time to save<br/>the breakfast from entire destruction; and she promptly brought the<br/>King out of his dreams with a brisk and cordial tongue-lashing.<br/>Then, seeing how troubled he was over his violated trust, she<br/>softened at once, and was all goodness and gentleness toward<br/>him.<br/><br/>The boy made a hearty and satisfying meal, and was greatly<br/>refreshed and gladdened by it. &#160;It was a meal which was<br/>distinguished by this curious feature, that rank was waived on both<br/>sides; yet neither recipient of the favour was aware that it had<br/>been extended. &#160;The goodwife had intended to feed this young<br/>tramp with broken victuals in a corner, like any other tramp or<br/>like a dog; but she was so remorseful for the scolding she had<br/>given him, that she did what she could to atone for it by allowing<br/>him to sit at the family table and eat with his betters, on<br/>ostensible terms of equality with them; and the King, on his side,<br/>was so remorseful for having broken his trust, after the family had<br/>been so kind to him, that he forced himself to atone for it by<br/>humbling himself to the family level, instead of requiring the<br/>woman and her children to stand and wait upon him, while he<br/>occupied their table in the solitary state due to his birth and<br/>dignity. &#160;It does us all good to unbend sometimes. &#160;This<br/>good woman was made happy all the day long by the applauses which<br/>she got out of herself for her magnanimous condescension to a<br/>tramp; and the King was just as self-complacent over his gracious<br/>humility toward a humble peasant woman.<br/>
