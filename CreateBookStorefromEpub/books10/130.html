Miles sprang forward, with a happy confidence, to meet her, but<br/>she checked him with a hardly perceptible gesture, and he stopped<br/>where he was. &#160;She seated herself, and asked him to do<br/>likewise. Thus simply did she take the sense of old comradeship out<br/>of him, and transform him into a stranger and a guest. &#160;The<br/>surprise of it, the bewildering unexpectedness of it, made him<br/>begin to question, for a moment, if he WAS the person he was<br/>pretending to be, after all. &#160;The Lady Edith said—<br/><br/>"Sir, I have come to warn you. &#160;The mad cannot be persuaded<br/>out of their delusions, perchance; but doubtless they may be<br/>persuaded to avoid perils. &#160;I think this dream of yours hath<br/>the seeming of honest truth to you, and therefore is not<br/>criminal—but do not tarry here with it; for here it is dangerous."<br/>&#160;She looked steadily into Miles's face a moment, then added,<br/>impressively, "It is the more dangerous for that you ARE much like<br/>what our lost lad must have grown to be if he had lived."<br/><br/>"Heavens, madam, but I AM he!"<br/><br/>"I truly think you think it, sir. &#160;I question not your<br/>honesty in that; I but warn you, that is all. &#160;My husband is<br/>master in this region; his power hath hardly any limit; the people<br/>prosper or starve, as he wills. If you resembled not the man whom<br/>you profess to be, my husband might bid you pleasure yourself with<br/>your dream in peace; but trust me, I know him well; I know what he<br/>will do; he will say to all that you are but a mad impostor, and<br/>straightway all will echo him." &#160;She bent upon Miles that same<br/>steady look once more, and added: &#160;"If you WERE Miles Hendon,<br/>and he knew it and all the region knew it—consider what I am<br/>saying, weigh it well—you would stand in the same peril, your<br/>punishment would be no less sure; he would deny you and denounce<br/>you, and none would be bold enough to give you countenance."<br/><br/>"Most truly I believe it," said Miles, bitterly. &#160;"The<br/>power that can command one life-long friend to betray and disown<br/>another, and be obeyed, may well look to be obeyed in quarters<br/>where bread and life are on the stake and no cobweb ties of loyalty<br/>and honour are concerned."<br/><br/>A faint tinge appeared for a moment in the lady's cheek, and she<br/>dropped her eyes to the floor; but her voice betrayed no emotion<br/>when she proceeded—<br/><br/>"I have warned you—I must still warn you—to go hence. &#160;This<br/>man will destroy you, else. &#160;He is a tyrant who knows no pity.<br/>&#160;I, who am his fettered slave, know this. &#160;Poor Miles,<br/>and Arthur, and my dear guardian, Sir Richard, are free of him, and<br/>at rest: &#160;better that you were with them than that you bide<br/>here in the clutches of this miscreant. &#160;Your pretensions are<br/>a menace to his title and possessions; you have assaulted him in<br/>his own house: &#160;you are ruined if you stay. &#160;Go—do not<br/>hesitate. If you lack money, take this purse, I beg of you, and<br/>bribe the servants to let you pass. Oh, be warned, poor soul, and<br/>escape while you may."<br/><br/>Miles declined the purse with a gesture, and rose up and stood<br/>before her.<br/><br/>"Grant me one thing," he said. &#160;"Let your eyes rest upon<br/>mine, so that I may see if they be steady. &#160;There—now answer<br/>me. &#160;Am I Miles Hendon?"<br/><br/>"No. &#160;I know you not."<br/><br/>"Swear it!"<br/>
