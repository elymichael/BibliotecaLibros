Then he asked Tom a question in Latin, and Tom answered him
lamely in the same tongue. &#160;The lords and doctors manifested
their gratification also. The King said—

"'Twas not according to his schooling and ability, but showeth
that his mind is but diseased, not stricken fatally. &#160;How say
you, sir?"

The physician addressed bowed low, and replied—

"It jumpeth with my own conviction, sire, that thou hast divined
aright."

The King looked pleased with this encouragement, coming as it
did from so excellent authority, and continued with good heart—

"Now mark ye all: &#160;we will try him further."

He put a question to Tom in French. &#160;Tom stood silent a
moment, embarrassed by having so many eyes centred upon him, then
said diffidently—

"I have no knowledge of this tongue, so please your
majesty."

The King fell back upon his couch. &#160;The attendants flew to
his assistance; but he put them aside, and said—

"Trouble me not—it is nothing but a scurvy faintness.
&#160;Raise me! There, 'tis sufficient. &#160;Come hither, child;
there, rest thy poor troubled head upon thy father's heart, and be
at peace. &#160;Thou'lt soon be well: &#160;'tis but a passing
fantasy. &#160;Fear thou not; thou'lt soon be well." &#160;Then he
turned toward the company: &#160;his gentle manner changed, and
baleful lightnings began to play from his eyes. &#160;He said—

"List ye all! &#160;This my son is mad; but it is not permanent.
&#160;Over-study hath done this, and somewhat too much of
confinement. &#160;Away with his books and teachers! see ye to it.
&#160;Pleasure him with sports, beguile him in wholesome ways, so
that his health come again." &#160;He raised himself higher still,
and went on with energy, "He is mad; but he is my son, and
England's heir; and, mad or sane, still shall he reign! &#160;And
hear ye further, and proclaim it: whoso speaketh of this his
distemper worketh against the peace and order of these realms, and
shall to the gallows!&#160;… Give me to drink—I burn: &#160;this
sorrow sappeth my strength… . There, take away the cup… . Support
me. &#160;There, that is well. &#160;Mad, is he? &#160;Were he a
thousand times mad, yet is he Prince of Wales, and I the King will
confirm it. &#160;This very morrow shall he be installed in his
princely dignity in due and ancient form. &#160;Take instant order
for it, my lord Hertford."
