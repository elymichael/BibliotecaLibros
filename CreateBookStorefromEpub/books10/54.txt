"What's amiss?"

"Good sir, I would wash me."

"Oh, is that all? &#160;Ask no permission of Miles Hendon for
aught thou cravest. &#160;Make thyself perfectly free here, and
welcome, with all that are his belongings."

Still the boy stood, and moved not; more, he tapped the floor
once or twice with his small impatient foot. &#160;Hendon was
wholly perplexed. &#160;Said he—

"Bless us, what is it?"

"Prithee pour the water, and make not so many words!"

Hendon, suppressing a horse-laugh, and saying to himself, "By
all the saints, but this is admirable!" stepped briskly forward and
did the small insolent's bidding; then stood by, in a sort of
stupefaction, until the command, "Come—the towel!" woke him sharply
up. &#160;He took up a towel, from under the boy's nose, and handed
it to him without comment. &#160;He now proceeded to comfort his
own face with a wash, and while he was at it his adopted child
seated himself at the table and prepared to fall to. Hendon
despatched his ablutions with alacrity, then drew back the other
chair and was about to place himself at table, when the boy said,
indignantly—

"Forbear! &#160;Wouldst sit in the presence of the King?"

This blow staggered Hendon to his foundations. &#160;He muttered
to himself, "Lo, the poor thing's madness is up with the time!
&#160;It hath changed with the great change that is come to the
realm, and now in fancy is he KING! Good lack, I must humour the
conceit, too—there is no other way—faith, he would order me to the
Tower, else!"

And pleased with this jest, he removed the chair from the table,
took his stand behind the King, and proceeded to wait upon him in
the courtliest way he was capable of.
