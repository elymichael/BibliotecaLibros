23
The Prince a prisoner


Hendon forced back a smile, and bent down and whispered in the
King's ear—

"Softly, softly, my prince, wag thy tongue warily—nay, suffer it
not to wag at all. &#160;Trust in me—all shall go well in the end."
Then he added to himself: &#160;"SIR Miles! &#160;Bless me, I had
totally forgot I was a knight! Lord, how marvellous a thing it is,
the grip his memory doth take upon his quaint and crazy
fancies!&#160;… An empty and foolish title is mine, and yet it is
something to have deserved it; for I think it is more honour to be
held worthy to be a spectre-knight in his Kingdom of Dreams and
Shadows, than to be held base enough to be an earl in some of the
REAL kingdoms of this world."

The crowd fell apart to admit a constable, who approached and
was about to lay his hand upon the King's shoulder, when Hendon
said—

"Gently, good friend, withhold your hand—he shall go peaceably;
I am responsible for that. &#160;Lead on, we will follow."

The officer led, with the woman and her bundle; Miles and the
King followed after, with the crowd at their heels. &#160;The King
was inclined to rebel; but Hendon said to him in a low voice—

"Reflect, Sire—your laws are the wholesome breath of your own
royalty; shall their source resist them, yet require the branches
to respect them? Apparently one of these laws has been broken; when
the King is on his throne again, can it ever grieve him to remember
that when he was seemingly a private person he loyally sank the
king in the citizen and submitted to its authority?"

"Thou art right; say no more; thou shalt see that whatsoever the
King of England requires a subject to suffer, under the law, he
will himself suffer while he holdeth the station of a subject."
