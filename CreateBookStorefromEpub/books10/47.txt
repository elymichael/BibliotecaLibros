"Sith that is thy humour, thou'lt NOT pass, till thou'st drunk
to the Prince of Wales, I tell thee that," said the waterman,
barring the way resolutely.

"Give me the cup, then, and make speed, make speed!"

Other revellers were interested by this time. &#160;They cried
out—

"The loving-cup, the loving-cup! make the sour knave drink the
loving-cup, else will we feed him to the fishes."

So a huge loving-cup was brought; the waterman, grasping it by
one of its handles, and with the other hand bearing up the end of
an imaginary napkin, presented it in due and ancient form to Canty,
who had to grasp the opposite handle with one of his hands and take
off the lid with the other, according to ancient custom. This left
the Prince hand-free for a second, of course. &#160;He wasted no
time, but dived among the forest of legs about him and disappeared.
&#160;In another moment he could not have been harder to find,
under that tossing sea of life, if its billows had been the
Atlantic's and he a lost sixpence.

He very soon realised this fact, and straightway busied himself
about his own affairs without further thought of John Canty.
&#160;He quickly realised another thing, too. &#160;To wit, that a
spurious Prince of Wales was being feasted by the city in his
stead. &#160;He easily concluded that the pauper lad, Tom Canty,
had deliberately taken advantage of his stupendous opportunity and
become a usurper.

Therefore there was but one course to pursue—find his way to the
Guildhall, make himself known, and denounce the impostor. &#160;He
also made up his mind that Tom should be allowed a reasonable time
for spiritual preparation, and then be hanged, drawn and quartered,
according to the law and usage of the day in cases of high
treason.
