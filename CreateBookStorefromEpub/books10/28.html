<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>6<br/>Tom receives instructions<br/><br/><br/>Tom was conducted to the principal apartment of a noble suite,<br/>and made to sit down—a thing which he was loth to do, since there<br/>were elderly men and men of high degree about him. &#160;He begged<br/>them to be seated also, but they only bowed their thanks or<br/>murmured them, and remained standing. He would have insisted, but<br/>his 'uncle' the Earl of Hertford whispered in his ear—<br/><br/>"Prithee, insist not, my lord; it is not meet that they sit in<br/>thy presence."<br/><br/>The Lord St. John was announced, and after making obeisance to<br/>Tom, he said—<br/><br/>"I come upon the King's errand, concerning a matter which<br/>requireth privacy. &#160;Will it please your royal highness to<br/>dismiss all that attend you here, save my lord the Earl of<br/>Hertford?"<br/><br/>Observing that Tom did not seem to know how to proceed, Hertford<br/>whispered him to make a sign with his hand, and not trouble himself<br/>to speak unless he chose. &#160;When the waiting gentlemen had<br/>retired, Lord St. John said—<br/><br/>"His majesty commandeth, that for due and weighty reasons of<br/>state, the prince's grace shall hide his infirmity in all ways that<br/>be within his power, till it be passed and he be as he was before.<br/>&#160;To wit, that he shall deny to none that he is the true<br/>prince, and heir to England's greatness; that he shall uphold his<br/>princely dignity, and shall receive, without word or sign of<br/>protest, that reverence and observance which unto it do appertain<br/>of right and ancient usage; that he shall cease to speak to any of<br/>that lowly birth and life his malady hath conjured out of the<br/>unwholesome imaginings of o'er-wrought fancy; that he shall strive<br/>with diligence to bring unto his memory again those faces which he<br/>was wont to know—and where he faileth he shall hold his peace,<br/>neither betraying by semblance of surprise or other sign that he<br/>hath forgot; that upon occasions of state, whensoever any matter<br/>shall perplex him as to the thing he should do or the utterance he<br/>should make, he shall show nought of unrest to the curious that<br/>look on, but take advice in that matter of the Lord Hertford, or my<br/>humble self, which are commanded of the King to be upon this<br/>service and close at call, till this commandment be dissolved.
