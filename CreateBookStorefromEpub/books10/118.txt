"I have a liking to thee, friend, and would not willingly see
thee come to harm. &#160;Observe, I heard it all—every word.
&#160;I will prove it to thee." Then he repeated the conversation
which the officer and the woman had had together in the hall, word
for word, and ended with—

"There—have I set it forth correctly? &#160;Should not I be able
to set it forth correctly before the judge, if occasion
required?"

The man was dumb with fear and distress, for a moment; then he
rallied, and said with forced lightness—

"'Tis making a mighty matter, indeed, out of a jest; I but
plagued the woman for mine amusement."

"Kept you the woman's pig for amusement?"

The man answered sharply—

"Nought else, good sir—I tell thee 'twas but a jest."

"I do begin to believe thee," said Hendon, with a perplexing
mixture of mockery and half-conviction in his tone; "but tarry thou
here a moment whilst I run and ask his worship—for nathless, he
being a man experienced in law, in jests, in—"

He was moving away, still talking; the constable hesitated,
fidgeted, spat out an oath or two, then cried out—

"Hold, hold, good sir—prithee wait a little—the judge!
&#160;Why, man, he hath no more sympathy with a jest than hath a
dead corpse!—come, and we will speak further. &#160;Ods body!
&#160;I seem to be in evil case—and all for an innocent and
thoughtless pleasantry. I am a man of family; and my wife and
little ones—List to reason, good your worship: what wouldst thou of
me?"
