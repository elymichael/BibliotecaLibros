"Might I crave your favour to carry my name to him, and say I
beg to say a word in his ear?"

"I will despatch the business right willingly, fair sir."

"Then say Miles Hendon, son of Sir Richard, is here without—I
shall be greatly bounden to you, my good lad."

The boy looked disappointed. &#160;"The King did not name him
so," he said to himself; "but it mattereth not, this is his twin
brother, and can give his Majesty news of t'other
Sir-Odds-and-Ends, I warrant." &#160;So he said to Miles, "Step in
there a moment, good sir, and wait till I bring you word."

Hendon retired to the place indicated—it was a recess sunk in
the palace wall, with a stone bench in it—a shelter for sentinels
in bad weather. He had hardly seated himself when some halberdiers,
in charge of an officer, passed by. &#160;The officer saw him,
halted his men, and commanded Hendon to come forth. &#160;He
obeyed, and was promptly arrested as a suspicious character
prowling within the precincts of the palace. &#160;Things began to

his lost little friend that black day at Hendon Hall. &#160;The
officer's face grew dark as he read the English paragraph, and
Miles blenched to the opposite colour as he listened.

"Another new claimant of the Crown!" cried the officer.
&#160;"Verily they breed like rabbits, to-day. &#160;Seize the
rascal, men, and see ye keep him fast whilst I convey this precious
paper within and send it to the King."

He hurried away, leaving the prisoner in the grip of the
halberdiers.

"Now is my evil luck ended at last," muttered Hendon, "for I
shall dangle at a rope's end for a certainty, by reason of that bit
of writing. &#160;And what will become of my poor lad!—ah, only the
good God knoweth."

By-and-by he saw the officer coming again, in a great hurry; so
he plucked his courage together, purposing to meet his trouble as
became a man. &#160;The officer ordered the men to loose the
prisoner and return his sword to him; then bowed respectfully, and
said—
