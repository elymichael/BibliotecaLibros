<br/><br/><br/>Justice and retribution<br/><br/><br/>When the mysteries were all cleared up, it came out, by<br/>confession of Hugh Hendon, that his wife had repudiated Miles by<br/>his command, that day at Hendon Hall—a command assisted and<br/>supported by the perfectly trustworthy promise that if she did not<br/>deny that he was Miles Hendon, and stand firmly to it, he would<br/>have her life; whereupon she said, "Take it!"—she did not value<br/>it—and she would not repudiate Miles; then the husband said he<br/>would spare her life but have Miles assassinated! &#160;This was a<br/>different matter; so she gave her word and kept it.<br/><br/>Hugh was not prosecuted for his threats or for stealing his<br/>brother's estates and title, because the wife and brother would not<br/>testify against him—and the former would not have been allowed to<br/>do it, even if she had wanted to. &#160;Hugh deserted his wife and<br/>went over to the continent, where he presently died; and by-and-by<br/>the Earl of Kent married his relict. There were grand times and<br/>rejoicings at Hendon village when the couple paid their first visit<br/>to the Hall.<br/><br/>Tom Canty's father was never heard of again.<br/><br/>The King sought out the farmer who had been branded and sold as<br/>a slave, and reclaimed him from his evil life with the Ruffler's<br/>gang, and put him in the way of a comfortable livelihood.<br/><br/>He also took that old lawyer out of prison and remitted his<br/>fine. He provided good homes for the daughters of the two Baptist<br/>women whom he saw burned at the stake, and roundly punished the<br/>official who laid the undeserved stripes upon Miles Hendon's<br/>back.<br/><br/>He saved from the gallows the boy who had captured the stray<br/>falcon, and also the woman who had stolen a remnant of cloth from a<br/>weaver; but he was too late to save the man who had been convicted<br/>of killing a deer in the royal forest.<br/><br/>He showed favour to the justice who had pitied him when he was<br/>supposed to have stolen a pig, and he had the gratification of<br/>seeing him grow in the public esteem and become a great and<br/>honoured man.<br/><br/>As long as the King lived he was fond of telling the story of<br/>his adventures, all through, from the hour that the sentinel cuffed<br/>him away from the palace gate till the final midnight when he<br/>deftly mixed himself into a gang of hurrying workmen and so slipped<br/>into the Abbey and climbed up and hid himself in the Confessor's<br/>tomb, and then slept so long, next day, that he came within one of<br/>missing the Coronation altogether. &#160;He said that the frequent<br/>rehearsing of the precious lesson kept him strong in his purpose to<br/>make its teachings yield benefits to his people; and so, whilst his<br/>life was spared he should continue to tell the story, and thus keep<br/>its sorrowful spectacles fresh in his memory and the springs of<br/>pity replenished in his heart.<br/><br/>
