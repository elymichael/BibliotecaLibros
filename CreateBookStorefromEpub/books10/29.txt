"The King hath said it. &#160;None may palter with the King's
command, or fit it to his ease, where it doth chafe, with deft
evasions. The King shall be obeyed."

Lord Hertford said—

"Touching the King's majesty's ordainment concerning books and
such like serious matters, it may peradventure please your highness
to ease your time with lightsome entertainment, lest you go wearied
to the banquet and suffer harm thereby."

Tom's face showed inquiring surprise; and a blush followed when
he saw Lord St. John's eyes bent sorrowfully upon him. &#160;His
lordship said—

"Thy memory still wrongeth thee, and thou hast shown
surprise—but suffer it not to trouble thee, for 'tis a matter that
will not bide, but depart with thy mending malady. &#160;My Lord of
Hertford speaketh of the city's banquet which the King's majesty
did promise, some two months flown, your highness should attend.
&#160;Thou recallest it now?"

"It grieves me to confess it had indeed escaped me," said Tom,
in a hesitating voice; and blushed again.

At this moment the Lady Elizabeth and the Lady Jane Grey were
announced. The two lords exchanged significant glances, and
Hertford stepped quickly toward the door. &#160;As the young girls
passed him, he said in a low voice—

"I pray ye, ladies, seem not to observe his humours, nor show
surprise when his memory doth lapse—it will grieve you to note how
it doth stick at every trifle."

Meantime Lord St. John was saying in Tom's ear—

"Please you, sir, keep diligently in mind his majesty's desire.
Remember all thou canst—SEEM to remember all else. &#160;Let them
not perceive that thou art much changed from thy wont, for thou
knowest how tenderly thy old play-fellows bear thee in their hearts
and how 'twould grieve them. Art willing, sir, that I remain?—and
thine uncle?"
