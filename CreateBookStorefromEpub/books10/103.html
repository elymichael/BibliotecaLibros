<br/>He took no note of the flight of time, but worked tranquilly on,<br/>entertaining himself with his thoughts, which broke out<br/>occasionally in articulate speech—<br/><br/>"His father wrought us evil, he destroyed us—and is gone down<br/>into the eternal fires! &#160;Yes, down into the eternal fires!<br/>&#160;He escaped us—but it was God's will, yes it was God's will,<br/>we must not repine. &#160;But he hath not escaped the fires!<br/>&#160;No, he hath not escaped the fires, the consuming, unpitying,<br/>remorseless fires—and THEY are everlasting!"<br/><br/>And so he wrought, and still wrought—mumbling, chuckling a low<br/>rasping chuckle at times—and at times breaking again into<br/>words—<br/><br/>"It was his father that did it all. &#160;I am but an archangel;<br/>but for him I should be pope!"<br/><br/>The King stirred. &#160;The hermit sprang noiselessly to the<br/>bedside, and went down upon his knees, bending over the prostrate<br/>form with his knife uplifted. &#160;The boy stirred again; his eyes<br/>came open for an instant, but there was no speculation in them,<br/>they saw nothing; the next moment his tranquil breathing showed<br/>that his sleep was sound once more.<br/><br/>The hermit watched and listened, for a time, keeping his<br/>position and scarcely breathing; then he slowly lowered his arms,<br/>and presently crept away, saying,—<br/><br/>"It is long past midnight; it is not best that he should cry<br/>out, lest by accident someone be passing."<br/><br/>He glided about his hovel, gathering a rag here, a thong there,<br/>and another one yonder; then he returned, and by careful and gentle<br/>handling he managed to tie the King's ankles together without<br/>waking him. &#160;Next he essayed to tie the wrists; he made<br/>several attempts to cross them, but the boy always drew one hand or<br/>the other away, just as the cord was ready to be applied; but at<br/>last, when the archangel was almost ready to despair, the boy<br/>crossed his hands himself, and the next moment they were bound. Now<br/>a bandage was passed under the sleeper's chin and brought up over<br/>his head and tied fast—and so softly, so gradually, and so deftly<br/>were the knots drawn together and compacted, that the boy slept<br/>peacefully through it all without stirring.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
