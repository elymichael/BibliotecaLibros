These and twenty other cries broke out at once! and almost
before the poor little victim could draw a breath he was crowned
with a tin basin, robed in a tattered blanket, throned upon a
barrel, and sceptred with the tinker's soldering-iron. &#160;Then
all flung themselves upon their knees about him and sent up a
chorus of ironical wailings, and mocking supplications, whilst they
swabbed their eyes with their soiled and ragged sleeves and
aprons—

"Be gracious to us, O sweet King!"

"Trample not upon thy beseeching worms, O noble Majesty!"

"Pity thy slaves, and comfort them with a royal kick!"

"Cheer us and warm us with thy gracious rays, O flaming sun of
sovereignty!"

"Sanctify the ground with the touch of thy foot, that we may eat
the dirt and be ennobled!"

"Deign to spit upon us, O Sire, that our children's children may
tell of thy princely condescension, and be proud and happy for
ever!"

But the humorous tinker made the 'hit' of the evening and
carried off the honours. &#160;Kneeling, he pretended to kiss the
King's foot, and was indignantly spurned; whereupon he went about
begging for a rag to paste over the place upon his face which had
been touched by the foot, saying it must be preserved from contact
with the vulgar air, and that he should make his fortune by going
on the highway and exposing it to view at the rate of a hundred
shillings a sight. &#160;He made himself so killingly funny that he
was the envy and admiration of the whole mangy rabble.

Tears of shame and indignation stood in the little monarch's
eyes; and the thought in his heart was, "Had I offered them a deep
wrong they could not be more cruel—yet have I proffered nought but
to do them a kindness—and it is thus they use me for it!"
