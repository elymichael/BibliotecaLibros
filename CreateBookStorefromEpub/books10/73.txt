"O my lord the King, an' thou canst pity the lost, have pity
upon me! &#160;I am innocent—neither hath that wherewith I am
charged been more than but lamely proved—yet I speak not of that;
the judgment is gone forth against me and may not suffer
alteration; yet in mine extremity I beg a boon, for my doom is more
than I can bear. A grace, a grace, my lord the King! in thy royal
compassion grant my prayer—give commandment that I be hanged!"

Tom was amazed. &#160;This was not the outcome he had looked
for.

"Odds my life, a strange BOON! &#160;Was it not the fate
intended thee?"

"O good my liege, not so! &#160;It is ordered that I be BOILED
ALIVE!"

The hideous surprise of these words almost made Tom spring from
his chair. &#160;As soon as he could recover his wits he cried
out—

"Have thy wish, poor soul! an' thou had poisoned a hundred men
thou shouldst not suffer so miserable a death."

The prisoner bowed his face to the ground and burst into
passionate expressions of gratitude—ending with—

"If ever thou shouldst know misfortune—which God forefend!—may
thy goodness to me this day be remembered and requited!"

Tom turned to the Earl of Hertford, and said—

"My lord, is it believable that there was warrant for this man's
ferocious doom?"
