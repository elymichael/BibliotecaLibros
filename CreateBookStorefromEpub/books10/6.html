<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>1<br/>The birth of the Prince and the Pauper<br/><br/><br/>In the ancient city of London, on a certain autumn day in the<br/>second quarter of the sixteenth century, a boy was born to a poor<br/>family of the name of Canty, who did not want him. &#160;On the<br/>same day another English child was born to a rich family of the<br/>name of Tudor, who did want him. All England wanted him too.<br/>&#160;England had so longed for him, and hoped for him, and prayed<br/>God for him, that, now that he was really come, the people went<br/>nearly mad for joy. &#160;Mere acquaintances hugged and kissed each<br/>other and cried. Everybody took a holiday, and high and low, rich<br/>and poor, feasted and danced and sang, and got very mellow; and<br/>they kept this up for days and nights together. &#160;By day,<br/>London was a sight to see, with gay banners waving from every<br/>balcony and housetop, and splendid pageants marching along.<br/>&#160;By night, it was again a sight to see, with its great<br/>bonfires at every corner, and its troops of revellers making merry<br/>around them. &#160;There was no talk in all England but of the new<br/>baby, Edward Tudor, Prince of Wales, who lay lapped in silks and<br/>satins, unconscious of all this fuss, and not knowing that great<br/>lords and ladies were tending him and watching over himâ€”and not<br/>caring, either. &#160;But there was no talk about the other baby,<br/>Tom Canty, lapped in his poor rags, except among the family of<br/>paupers whom he had just come to trouble with his presence.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
