The Empress having received an information of what concerned<br/>both Church and State, passed some time in viewing the Imperial<br/>Palace, where she admired much the skil and ingenuity of the<br/>Architects, and enquired of them, first, Why they built their<br/>Houses no higher then two stories from the Ground? They answered<br/>her Majesty, That the lower their Buildings were, the less were<br/>they subject either to the heat of the Sun, or Wind, Tempest,<br/>Decay, &amp;c. Then she desired to know the reason, why they made<br/>them so thick? They answered, That, the thicker the Walls were, the<br/>warmer they were in Winter, the cooler in Summer; for their<br/>thickness kept out both the Cold and Heat. Lastly, she asked, Why<br/>they Arched their Roofs, and made so many Pillars? They replied,<br/>That Arches and Pillars, did not onely grace a Building very much,<br/>and caused it to appear Magnificent, but made it also firm and<br/>lasting.<br/><br/>The Empress was very well satisfied with their answers; and<br/>after some time, when she thought that her new founded societies of<br/>the Vertuoso's had made a good progress in the several Employments<br/>she had put them upon, she caused a Convocation first of the<br/>Bird-men, and commanded them to give her a true relation of the two<br/>Cœlestial Bodies, viz. the Sun and Moon, which they did with all<br/>the obedience and faithfulness befitting their duty.<br/><br/>The Sun, as much as they could observe, they related to be a<br/>firm or solid Stone, of a vast bigness; of colour yellowish, and of<br/>an extraordinary splendor: But the Moon, they said, was of a<br/>whitish colour; and although she looked dim in the presence of the<br/>Sun, yet had she her own light, and was a shining body of her self,<br/>as might be perceived by her vigorous appearance in<br/>Moon-shiny-nights; the difference onely betwixt her own and the<br/>Sun's light was, that the Sun did strike his beams in a direct<br/>line; but the Moon never respected the Centre of their World in a<br/>right line, but her Centre was always excentrical. The Spots both<br/>in the Sun and Moon, as far as they were able to perceive, they<br/>affirmed to be nothing else but flaws and stains of their stony<br/>Bodies. Concerning the heat of the Sun, they were not of one<br/>opinion; some would have the Sun hot in it self, alledging an old<br/>Tradition, that it should at some time break asunder, and burn the<br/>Heavens, and consume this world into&#160;hot Embers, which, said<br/>they, could not be done, if the Sun were not fiery of it self.<br/>Others again said, This opinion could not stand with reason; for<br/>Fire being a destroyer of all things, the Sun-stone after this<br/>manner would burn up all the near adjoining Bodies: Besides, said<br/>they, Fire cannot subsist without fuel; and the Sunstone having<br/>nothing to feed on, would in a short time consume it self;<br/>wherefore they thought it more probable that the Sun was not<br/>actually hot, but onely by the reflection of its light; so that its<br/>heat was an effect of its light, both being immaterial. But this<br/>opinion again was laught at by others, and rejected as ridiculous,<br/>who thought it impossible that one immaterial should produce<br/>another; and believed that both the light and heat of the Sun<br/>proceeded from a swift Circular motion of the Æthereal Globules,<br/>which by their striking upon the Optick nerve, caused light, and<br/>their motion produced heat: But neither would this opinion hold;<br/>for, said some, then it would follow, that the sight of Animals is<br/>the cause of light; and that, were there no eyes, there would be no<br/>light; which was against all sense and reason. Thus they argued<br/>concerning the heat and light of the Sun; but, which is remarkable,<br/>none did say, that the Sun was a Globous fluid body, and had a<br/>swift Circular motion; but all agreed, It was fixt and firm like a<br/>Center, and therefore they generally called it the Sun-stone.<br/><br/>Then the Empress asked them the reason, Why the Sun and Moon did<br/>often appear in different postures or shapes, as sometimes<br/>magnified, sometimes diminished; sometimes elevated, otherwhiles<br/>depressed; now thrown to the right, and then to the left? To which<br/>some of the Bird-men answered, That it proceeded from the various<br/>degrees of heat and cold, which are found in the Air, from whence<br/>did follow a differing density and rarity; and likewise from the<br/>vapours that are interposed, whereof those that ascend are higher<br/>and less dense then the ambient air, but those which descend are<br/>heavier and more dense. But others did with more probability<br/>affirm, that it was nothing else but the various patterns of the<br/>Air; for like as Painters do not copy out one and the same original<br/>just alike at all times; so, said they, do several parts of the Air<br/>make different patterns of the luminous Bodies of the Sun and Moon:<br/>which patterns, as several copies, the sensitive motions do figure<br/>out in the substance of our eyes.<br/><br/>This answer the Empress liked much better then the former, and<br/>enquired further, What opinion they had of those Creatures that are<br/>called the motes of the Sun? To which they answered, That they were<br/>nothing else but streams of very small, rare and transparent<br/>particles, through which the Sun was represented as through a<br/>glass: for if they were not transparent, said they, they would<br/>eclipse the light of the Sun; and if not rare and of an airy<br/>substance, they would hinder&#160;Flies from flying in the Air, at<br/>least retard their flying motion: Nevertheless, although they were<br/>thinner then the thinnest vapour, yet were they not so thin as the<br/>body of air, or else they would not be perceptible by animal sight.<br/>Then the Empress asked, Whether they were living Creatures? They<br/>answered, Yes: Because they did encrease and decrease, and were<br/>nourished by the presence, and starved by the absence of the<br/>Sun.<br/><br/>Having thus finished their discourse of the Sun and Moon, the<br/>Empress desired to know what Stars there were besides? But they<br/>answer'd, that they could perceive in that World none other but<br/>Blazing Stars, and from thence it had the name that it was called<br/>the Blazing-World; and these Blazing-Stars, said they, were such<br/>solid, firm and shining bodies as the Sun and Moon, not of a<br/>Globular, but of several sorts of figures: some had tails; and<br/>some, other kinds of shapes.<br/><br/>After this, The Empress asked them, What kind of substance or<br/>creature the Air was? The Bird-men answered, That they could have<br/>no other perception of the Air, but by their own Respiration: For,<br/>said they, some bodies are onely subject to touch, others onely to<br/>sight, and others onely to smell; but some are subject to none of<br/>our exterior Senses: For Nature is so full of variety, that our<br/>weak Senses cannot perceive all the various sorts of her Creatures;<br/>neither is there any one&#160;object perceptible by all our Senses,<br/>no more then several objects are by one sense. I believe you,<br/>replied the Empress; but if you can give no account of the Air,<br/>said she, you will hardly be able to inform me how Wind is made;<br/>for they say, that Wind is nothing but motion of the Air. The<br/>Bird-men answer'd, That they observed Wind to be more dense then<br/>Air, and therefore subject to the sense of Touch; but what properly<br/>Wind was, and the manner how it was made, they could not exactly<br/>tell; some said, it was caused by the Clouds falling on each other;<br/>and others, that it was produced of a hot and dry exhalation: which<br/>ascending, was driven down again by the coldness of the Air that is<br/>in the middle Region, and by reason of its leightness, could not go<br/>directly to the bottom, but was carried by the Air up and down:<br/>Some would have it a flowing Water of the Air; and others again, a<br/>flowing Air moved by the blaz of the Stars.<br/><br/>But the Empress, seeing they could not agree concerning the<br/>cause of Wind, asked, Whether they could tell how Snow was made? To<br/>which they answered That according to their observation, Snow was<br/>made by a commixture of Water, and some certain extract of the<br/>Element of Fire that is under the Moon; a small portion of which<br/>extract, being mixed with Water, and beaten by Air or Wind, made a<br/>white Froth called Snow; which being after some while dissolved by<br/>the heat of the same spirit, turned to Water again.<br/>This&#160;observation amazed the Empress very much; for she had<br/>hitherto believed, That Snow was made by cold motions, and not by<br/>such an agitation or beating of a fiery extract upon water: Nor<br/>could she be perswaded to believe it until the Fish- or Mear-men<br/>had delivered their observation upon the making of Ice, which, they<br/>said, was not produced, as some hitherto conceived, by the motion<br/>of the Air, raking the Superficies of the Earth, but by some strong<br/>saline vapour arising out of the Seas, which condensed Water into<br/>Ice; and the more quantity there was of that vapour, the greater<br/>were the Mountains of Precipices of Ice; but the reason that it did<br/>not so much freeze in the Torrid Zone, or under the Ecliptick, as<br/>near or under the Poles, was, that this vapour in those places<br/>being drawn up by the Sun-beams into the middle Region of the Air,<br/>was onely condensed into Water, and fell down in showres of Rain;<br/>when as, under the Poles, the heat of the Sun being not so<br/>vehement, the same vapour had no force or power to rise so high,<br/>and therefore caused so much Ice, by ascending and acting onely<br/>upon the surface of water.<br/><br/>This Relation confirmed partly the observation of the Bird-men<br/>concerning the cause of Snow; but since they had made mention that<br/>that same extract, which by its commixture with Water made Snow,<br/>proceeded from the Element of Fire, that is under the Moon: The<br/>Emperess asked them, of what nature that Elementary&#160;Fire was;<br/>whether it was like ordinary Fire here upon Earth, or such a Fire<br/>as is within the bowels of the Earth, and as the famous Mountains<br/>Vesuvius and Ætna do burn withal; or whether it was such a sort of<br/>fire, as is found in flints, &amp;c. They answered, That the<br/>Elementary Fire, which is underneath the Sun, was not so solid as<br/>any of those mentioned fires; because it had no solid fuel to feed<br/>on; but yet it was much like the flame of ordinary fire, onely<br/>somewhat more thin and fluid; for Flame, said they, is nothing else<br/>but the airy part of a fired Body.<br/><br/>Lastly, the Empress asked the Bird-men of the nature of Thunder<br/>and Lightning? and whether it was not caused by roves of Ice<br/>falling upon each other? To which they answered, That it was not<br/>made that way, but by an encounter of cold and heat; so that an<br/>exhalation being kindled in the Clouds, did dash forth Lightning,<br/>and that there were so many rentings of Clouds as there were Sounds<br/>and Cracking noises: But this opinion was contradicted by others,<br/>who affirmed that Thunder was a sudden and monstrous Blaz, stirred<br/>up in the Air, and did not always require a Cloud; but the Empress<br/>not knowing what they meant by Blaz (for even they themselves were<br/>not able to explain the sense of this word) liked the former<br/>better; and, to avoid hereafter tedious disputes, and have the<br/>truth of the Phænomena's of Cœlestial Bodies more exactly known,<br/>commanded the Bear-men,&#160;which were her Experimental<br/>Philosophers, to observe them through such Instruments as are<br/>called Telescopes, which they did according to her Majesties<br/>Command; but these Telescopes caused more differences and divisions<br/>amongst them, then ever they had before; for some said, they<br/>perceived that the Sun stood still, and the Earth did move about<br/>it; others were of opinion, that they both did move; and others<br/>said again, that the Earth stood still, and Sun did move; some<br/>counted more Stars then others; some discovered new Stars never<br/>seen before; some fell into a great dispute with others concerning<br/>the bigness of the Stars; some said, The Moon was another World<br/>like their Terrestrial Globe, and the spots therein were Hills and<br/>Vallies; but others would have the spots to be the Terrestrial<br/>parts, and the smooth and glossie parts, the Sea: At last, the<br/>Empress commanded them to go with their Telescopes to the very end<br/>of the Pole that was joined to the World she came from, and try<br/>whether they could perceive any Stars in it: which they did; and,<br/>being returned to her Majesty, reported that they had seen three<br/>Blazing-Stars appear there, one after another in a short time,<br/>whereof two were bright, and one dim; but they could not agree<br/>neither in this observation: for some said, It was but one Star<br/>which appeared at three several times, in several places; and<br/>others would have them to be three several Stars; for they thought<br/>it impossible, that those three several appearances<br/>should&#160;have been but one Star, because every Star did rise at<br/>a certain time, and appear'd in a certain place, and did disappear<br/>in the same place: Next, It is altogether improbable, said they,<br/>That one Star should fly from place to place, especially at such a<br/>vast distance, without a visible motion; in so short a time, and<br/>appear in such different places, whereof two were quite opposite,<br/>and the third side-ways: Lastly, If it had been but one Star, said<br/>they, it would always have kept the same splendor, which it did<br/>not; for, as above mentioned, two were bright, and one was dim.<br/>After they had thus argued, the Empress began to grow angry at<br/>their Telescopes, that they could give no better Intelligence; for,<br/>said she, now I do plainly perceive, that your Glasses are false<br/>Informers, and instead of discovering the Truth, delude your<br/>Senses; Wherefore I Command you to break them, and let the Bird-men<br/>trust onely to their natural eyes, and examine Cœlestial Objects by<br/>the motions of their own Sense and Reason. The Bear-men replied,<br/>That it was not the fault of their Glasses, which caused such<br/>differences in their Opinions, but the sensitive motions in their<br/>Optick organs did not move alike, nor were their rational judgments<br/>always regular: To which the Empress answered, That if their<br/>Glasses were true Informers, they would rectifie their irregular<br/>Sense and Reason; But, said she, Nature has made your Sense and<br/>Reason more regular then Art has your Glasses; for they are meer<br/>deluders,&#160;and will never lead you to the knowledg of Truth;<br/>Wherefore I command you again to break them; for you may observe<br/>the progressive motions of Cœlestial Bodies with your natural eyes<br/>better then through Artificial Glasses. The Bear-men being<br/>exceedingly troubled at her Majesties displeasure concerning their<br/>Telescopes, kneel'd down, and in the humblest manner petitioned,<br/>that they might not be broken; for, said they, we take more delight<br/>in Artificial delusions, then in Natural truths. Besides, we shall<br/>want Imployments for our Senses, and Subjects for Arguments; for,<br/>were there nothing but truth, and no falshood, there would be no<br/>occasion to dispute, and by this means we should want the aim and<br/>pleasure of our endeavors in confuting and contradicting each<br/>other; neither would one man be thought wiser then another, but all<br/>would either be alike knowing and wise, or all would be fools;<br/>wherefore we most humbly beseech your Imperial Majesty to spare our<br/>Glasses, which are our onely delight, and as dear to us as our<br/>lives. The Empress at last consented to their request, but upon<br/>condition, that their disputes and quarrels should remain within<br/>their Schools, and cause no factions or disturbances in State, or<br/>Government. The Bear-men, full of joy, returned their most humble<br/>thanks to the Empress; and to make her amends for the displeasure<br/>which their Telescopes had occasioned, told her Majesty, that they<br/>had several other artificial Optick-Glasses, which they&#160;were<br/>sure would give her Majesty a great deal more satisfaction. Amongst<br/>the rest, they brought forth several Microscopes, by the means of<br/>which they could enlarge the shapes of little bodies, and make a<br/>Lowse appear as big as an Elephant, and a Mite as big as a Whale.<br/>First of all they shewed the Empress a gray Drone-flye, wherein<br/>they observed that the greatest part of her face, nay, of her head,<br/>consisted of two large bunches all cover'd over with a multitude of<br/>small Pearls or Hemispheres in a Trigonal order: Which Pearls were<br/>of two degrees, smaller and bigger; the smaller degree was<br/>lowermost, and looked towards the ground; the other was upward, and<br/>looked sideward, forward and backward: They were all so smooth and<br/>polished, that they were able to represent the image of any object,<br/>the number of them was in all 14000. After the view of this strange<br/>and miraculous Creature, and their several observations upon it,<br/>the Empress asked them, What they judged those little Hemispheres<br/>might be? They answered, That each of them was a perfect Eye, by<br/>reason they perceived that each was covered with a Transparent<br/>Cornea, containing a liquor within them, which resembled the watery<br/>or glassie humor of the Eye. To which the Emperess replied, That<br/>they might be glassie Pearls, and yet not Eyes; and that perhaps<br/>their Microscopes did not truly inform them. But they smilingly<br/>answered her Majesty, That she did not know the vertue<br/>of&#160;those Microscopes: for they never delude, but rectifie and<br/>inform the Senses; nay, the World, said they, would be but blind<br/>without them, as it has been in former ages before those<br/>Microscopes were invented.<br/><br/>After this, they took a Charcoal, and viewing it with one of<br/>their best Microscopes, discovered in it an infinite multitude of<br/>pores, some bigger, some less; so close and thick, that they left<br/>but very little space betwixt them to be filled with a solid body;<br/>and to give her Imperial Majesty a better assurance thereof, they<br/>counted in a line of them an inch long, no less then 2700 pores;<br/>from which Observation they drew this following Conclusion, to wit,<br/>That this multitude of pores was the cause of the blackness of the<br/>Coal; for, said they, a body that has so many pores, from each of<br/>which no light is reflected, must necessarily look black, since<br/>black is nothing else but a privation of light, or a want of<br/>reflection. But the Empress replied, That if all Colours were made<br/>by reflection of light, and that Black was as much a colour as any<br/>other colour; then certainly they contradicted themselves in saying<br/>that black was made by want of reflection. However, not to<br/>interrupt your Microscopical Inspections, said she, let us see how<br/>Vegetables appear through your Glasses; whereupon they took a<br/>Nettle, and by the vertue of the Microscope, discovered that<br/>underneath the points of the Nettle there were certain little bags<br/>or&#160;bladders, containing a poysonous liquor, and when the<br/>points had made way into the interior parts of the skin, they like<br/>Syringe-pipes served to conveigh that same liquor into them. To<br/>which Observation the Empress replied, That if there were such<br/>poyson in Nettles, then certainly in eating of them, they would<br/>hurt us inwardly, as much as they do outwardly? But they answered,<br/>That it belonged to Physicians more then to Experimental<br/>Philosophers, to give Reasons hereof; for they only made<br/>Microscopical inspections, and related the Figures of the Natural<br/>parts of Creatures acording to the representation of their<br/>glasses.<br/>
