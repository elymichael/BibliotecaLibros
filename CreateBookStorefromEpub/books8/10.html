<br/>Lastly, They shewed the Empress a Flea, and a Lowse; which<br/>Creatures through the Microscope appear'd so terrible to her sight,<br/>that they had almost put her into a swoon; the description of all<br/>their parts would be very tedious to relate, and therefore I'le<br/>forbear it at this present. The Empress, after the view of those<br/>strangely-shaped Creatures, pitied much those that are molested<br/>with them, especially poor Beggars, which although they have<br/>nothing to live on themselves, are yet necessitated to maintain and<br/>feed of their own flesh and blood, a company of such terrible<br/>Creatures called Lice; who, instead of thanks, do reward them with<br/>pains, and torment them for giving them nourishment and food. But<br/>after the Empress had seen the shapes of these monstrous Creatures,<br/>she desir'd to know, Whether their Microscopes could&#160;hinder<br/>their biting, or at least shew some means how to avoid them? To<br/>which they answered, That such Arts were mechanical and below the<br/>noble study of Microscopical observations. Then the Empress asked<br/>them, Whether they had not such sorts of Glasses that could enlarge<br/>and magnifie the shapes of great Bodies as well as they had done of<br/>little ones? Whereupon they took one of their best and largest<br/>Microscopes, and endeavoured to view a Whale thorow it; but alas!<br/>the shape of the Whale was so big, that its Circumference went<br/>beyond the magnifying quality of the Glass; whether the error<br/>proceeded from the Glass, or from a wrong position of the Whale<br/>against the reflection of light, I cannot certainly tell. The<br/>Empress seeing the insufficiency of those Magnifying-Glasses, that<br/>they were not able to enlarge all sorts of Objects, asked the<br/>Bear-men, whether they could not make Glasses of a contrary nature<br/>to those they had shewed her, to wit, such as instead of enlarging<br/>or magnifying the shape or figure of an Object, could contract it<br/>beneath its natural proportion: Which, in obedience to her<br/>Majesties Commands, they did; and viewing through one of the best<br/>of them, a huge and mighty Whale appear'd no bigger then a Sprat;<br/>nay, through some no bigger then a Vinegar-Eele; and through their<br/>ordinary ones, an Elephant seemed no bigger then a Flea; a Camel no<br/>bigger then a Lowse; and an Ostrich no bigger then a Mite. To<br/>relate all their Optick observations&#160;through the several sorts<br/>of their Glasses, would be a tedious work, and tire even the most<br/>patient Reader, wherefore I'le pass them by; onely this was very<br/>remarkable and worthy to be taken notice of, that notwithstanding<br/>their great skil, industry and ingenuity in Experimental<br/>Philosophy, they could yet by no means contrive such Glasses, by<br/>the help of which they could spy out a Vacuum, with all its<br/>dimensions, nor Immaterial substances, Non-beings, and Mixt-beings,<br/>or such as are between something and nothing; which they were very<br/>much troubled at, hoping that yet, in time, by long study and<br/>practice, they might perhaps attain to it.<br/><br/>The Bird- and Bear-men being dismissed, the Empress called both<br/>the Syrens- or Fish-men, and the Worm-men, to deliver their<br/>Observations which they had made, both within the Seas, and the<br/>Earth. First, she enquired of the Fish-men whence the saltness of<br/>the Sea did proceed? To which they answered, That there was a<br/>volatile salt in those parts of the Earth, which as a bosom contain<br/>the Waters of the Sea, which Salt being imbibed by the Sea, became<br/>fixt; and this imbibing motion was that they call'd the Ebbing and<br/>Flowing of the Sea; for, said they, the rising and swelling of the<br/>Water, is caused by those parts of the volatile Salt as are not so<br/>easily imbibed, which striving to ascend above the Water, bear it<br/>up with such a motion, as Man, or some other Animal Creature, in a<br/>violent&#160;exercise uses to take breath. This they affirmed to be<br/>the true cause both of the saltness, and the ebbing and<br/>flowing-motion of the Sea, and not the jogging of the Earth, or the<br/>secret influence of the Moon, as some others had made the World<br/>believe.<br/><br/>After this, the Empress enquired, Whether they had observed,<br/>that all Animal Creatures within the Seas and other waters, had<br/>blood? They answered, That some had blood, more or less, but some<br/>had none. In Crea-fishes and Lobsters, said they, we perceive but<br/>little blood; but in Crabs, Oysters, Cockles, &amp;c. none at all.<br/>Then the Empress asked them, in what part of their Bodies that<br/>little blood did reside? They answered, in a small vein, which in<br/>Lobsters went through the middle of their tails, but in Crea-fishes<br/>was found in their backs: as for other sorts of Fishes, some, said<br/>they, had onely blood about their Gills, and others in some other<br/>places of their Bodies; but they had not as yet observed any whose<br/>veins did spread all over their Bodies. The Empress wondring that<br/>there could be living Animals without Blood, to be better<br/>satisfied, desired the Worm-men to inform her, whether they had<br/>observed Blood in all sorts of Worms? They answered, That, as much<br/>as they could perceive, some had Blood, and some not; a Moth, said<br/>they, had no Blood at all, and a Lowse had, but like a Lobster, a<br/>little Vein along her back: Also Nits, Snails, and Maggots, as well<br/>as those that are generated out of Cheese&#160;and Fruits, as those<br/>that are produced out of Flesh, had no blood: But, replied the<br/>Empress, If those mentioned creatures have no blood, how is it<br/>possible they can live? for it is commonly said, That the life of<br/>an Animal consists in the blood, which is the seat of the Animal<br/>spirits. They answered, That blood was not a necessary propriety to<br/>the life of an Animal; and that that which was commonly called<br/>Animal spirits, was nothing else but corporeal motions proper to<br/>the nature and figure of an Animal. Then she asked both the Fish-<br/>and Worm-men, whether all those Creatures that have blood, had a<br/>circulation of blood in their veins and arteries? But they<br/>answered, That it was impossible to give her Majesty an exact<br/>account thereof, by reason the circulation of blood was an interior<br/>motion, which their senses, neither of themselves, nor by the help<br/>of any Optick Instrument could perceive; but as soon as they had<br/>dissected an Animal Creature, to find out the truth thereof, the<br/>interior corporeal motions proper to that particular figure or<br/>creature, were altered. Then said the Empress, If all Animal<br/>Creatures have not blood, it is certain, they all have neither<br/>Muscles, tendons, nerves, &amp;c. But, said she, Have you ever<br/>observed Animal Creatures that are neither flesh, nor Fish, but of<br/>an intermediate degree between both? Truly, answered both the Fish-<br/>and Worm-men, We have observed several Animal Creatures that live<br/>both in Water, and on the Earth, indifferently, and if<br/>any,&#160;certainly those may be said to be of such a mixt nature,<br/>that is, partly Flesh, and partly Fish: But how is it possible,<br/>replied the Empress, that they should live both in Water, and on<br/>the Earth, since those Animals that live by the respiration of Air,<br/>cannot live within Water; and those that live in Water, cannot live<br/>by the respiration of Air, as Experience doth sufficiently witness.<br/>They answered her Majesty, That as there were different sorts of<br/>Creatures, so they had also different ways of Respirations; for<br/>Respiration, said they, is nothing else but a composition and<br/>division of parts, and the motions of nature being infinitely<br/>various, it is impossible that all Creatures should have the like<br/>motions; wherefore it was not necessary, that all Animal Creatures<br/>should be bound to live either by the Air, or by Water onely, but<br/>according as Nature had ordered it convenient to their Species. The<br/>Empress seem'd very well satisfied with their answer, and desired<br/>to be further informed, Whether all Animal Creatures did continue<br/>their Species by a successive propogation of particulars, and<br/>whether in every Species the off-springs did always resemble their<br/>Generator or Producer, both in their interior and exterior Figures?<br/>They answered, her Majesty, That some Species or sorts of<br/>Creatures, were kept up by a successive propagation of an offspring<br/>that was like the producer, but some were not. Of the first rank,<br/>said they, are all those Animals that are of different sexes,<br/>besides several others; but of the&#160;second rank are for the<br/>most part those we call Insects, whose production proceds from such<br/>causes as have no conformity or likeness with their produced<br/>Effects; as for example, Maggots bred out of Cheese, and several<br/>others generated out of Earth, Water, and the like. But said the<br/>Empress, there is some likeness between Maggots and Cheese; for<br/>Cheese has no blood, nor Maggots neither; besides, they have almost<br/>the same taste which Cheese has. This proves nothing, answered<br/>they; for Maggots have a visible, local, progressive motion, which<br/>Cheese hath not. The Empress replied, That when all the Cheese was<br/>turned into Maggots, it might be said to have local, progressive<br/>motion. They answered, That when the Cheese by its own figurative<br/>motions was changed into Maggots, it was no more Cheese. The<br/>Empress confessed that she observed Nature was infinitely various<br/>in her works, and that though the species of Creatures did<br/>continue, yet their particulars were subject to infinite changes.<br/>But since you have informed me, said she, of the various sorts and<br/>productions of Animal Creatures, I desire you to tell me what you<br/>have observed of their sensitive perceptions? Truly, answered they,<br/>Your Majesty puts a very hard question to us, and we shall hardly<br/>be able to give a satisfactory answer to it; for there are many<br/>different sorts of Creatures, which as they have all different<br/>perceptions, so they have also different organs, which&#160;our<br/>senses are not able to discover, onely in an Oystershell we have<br/>with admiration observed, that the common sensorium of the Oyster<br/>lies just as the closing of the shells, where the pressure and<br/>reaction may be perceived by the opening and shutting of the shells<br/>every tide.<br/><br/>After all this, the Empress desired the Worm men to give her a<br/>true Relation how frost was made upon the Earth? To which they<br/>answered, That it was made much after the manner and description of<br/>the Fish- and Bird-men, concerning the Congelation of Water into<br/>Ice and Snow, by a commixture of saline and acid particles; which<br/>relation added a great light to the Ape-men, who were the Chymists,<br/>concerning their Chymical principles, Salt, Sulphur, and Mercury.<br/>But, said the Empress, if it be so, it will require an infinite<br/>multitude of saline particles to produce such a great quantity of<br/>Ice, Frost and Snow: besides, said she, when Snow, Ice and Frost,<br/>turn again into their former principle, I would fain know what<br/>becomes of those saline particles? But neither the Worm-men, nor<br/>the Fish- and Bird-men, could give her an answer to it.<br/><br/>Then the Empress enquired of them the reason, Why Springs were<br/>not as salt as the Sea is? also, why some did ebb and flow? To<br/>which it was answered, That the ebbing and flowing of some Springs,<br/>was caused by hollow Caverns within the Earth, where the Seawater<br/>crowding thorow, did thrust forward, and drew backward the<br/>Spring-water, according to its own way of&#160;ebbing and flowing;<br/>but others said, That it proceeded from a small proportion of<br/>saline and acid particles, which the Spring-water imbibed from the<br/>Earth; and although it was not so much as to be perceived by the<br/>sense of Taste; yet it was enough to cause an ebbing and<br/>flowing-motion. And as for the Spring- water being fresh, they<br/>gave, according to their Observation, this following reason: There<br/>is, said they, a certain heat within the Bowels of the Earth,<br/>proceeding from its swift circular motion, upon its own axe, which<br/>heat distills the rarest parts of the Earth into a fresh and<br/>insipid water, which water being through the pores of the Earth,<br/>conveighed into a place where it may break forth without resistance<br/>or obstruction, causes Springs and Fountains; and these distilled<br/>Waters within the Earth, do nourish and refresh the grosser and<br/>drier parts thereof. This Relation confirmed the Empress in the<br/>opinion concerning the motion of the Earth, and the fixedness of<br/>the Sun, as the Bird-men had informed her; and then she asked the<br/>Worm-men, whether Minerals and Vegetables were generated by the<br/>same heat that is within the Bowels of the Earth? To which they<br/>could give her no positive answer; onely this they affirmed, That<br/>heat and cold were not the primary producing causes of either<br/>Vegetables or Minerals, or other sorts of Creatures, but onely<br/>effects; and to prove this our assertion, said they, we have<br/>observed, that by change of some sorts of Corporeal<br/>motions,&#160;that which is now hot, will become cold; and what is<br/>now cold, will grow hot; but the hottest place of all, we find to<br/>be the Center of the Earth: Neither do we observe, that the Torrid<br/>Zone does contain so much Gold and Silver as the Temperate; nor is<br/>there great store of Iron and Lead wheresoever there is Gold; for<br/>these Metals are most found in colder Climates towards either of<br/>the Poles. This Observation, the Empress commanded them to confer<br/>with her Chymists, the Ape-men; to let them know that Gold was not<br/>produced by a violent, but a temperate degree of heat. She asked<br/>further, Whether Gold could not be made by Art? They answered, That<br/>they could not certainly tell her Majesty, but if it was possible<br/>to be done, they thought Tin, Lead, Brass, Iron and Silver, to be<br/>the fittest Metals for such an Artificial Transmutation. Then she<br/>asked them, Whether Art could produce Iron, Tin, Lead, or Silver?<br/>They answered, Not, in their opinion. Then I perceive, replyed the<br/>Empress, that your judgments are very irregular, since you believe<br/>that Gold, which is so fixt a Metal, that nothing has been found as<br/>yet which could occasion a dissolution of its interior figure, may<br/>be made by Art, and not Tin, Lead, Iron, Copper or Silver, which<br/>yet are so far weaker, and meaner Metals then Gold is. But the<br/>Worm-men excused themselves, that they were ignorant in that Art,<br/>and that such questions belonged more properly to&#160;the Ape-men,<br/>which were Her Majesties Chymists.<br/><br/>Then the Empress asked them, Whether by their Sensitive<br/>perceptions they could observe the interior corporeal, figurative<br/>Motions both of Vegetables and Minerals? They answer'd, That their<br/>Senses could perceive them after they were produced, but not<br/>before; Nevertheless, said they, although the interior, figurative<br/>motions of Natural Creatures are not subject to the exterior,<br/>animal, sensitive perceptions, yet by their Rational perception<br/>they may judg of them, and of their productions if they be regular:<br/>Whereupon the Empress commanded the Bear-men to lend them some of<br/>their best Microscopes. At which the Bear- men smilingly answered<br/>her Majesty, that their Glasses would do them but little service in<br/>the bowels of the Earth, because there was no light; for, said<br/>they, our Glasses do onely represent exterior objects, according to<br/>the various reflections and positions of light; and wheresoever<br/>light is wanting, the glasses wil do no good. To which the Worm-men<br/>replied, that although they could not say much of refractions,<br/>reflections, inflections, and the like; yet were they not blind,<br/>even in the bowels of the Earth: for they could see the several<br/>sorts of Minerals, as also minute Animals, that lived there; which<br/>minute Animal Creatures were not blind neither, but had some kind<br/>of sensitive perception that was as serviceable to them, as sight,<br/>taste, smell, touch,&#160;hearing, &amp;c. was to other Animal<br/>Creatures: By which it is evident, That Nature has been as<br/>bountiful to those Creatures that live underground, or in the<br/>bowels of the Earth, as to those that live upon the surface of the<br/>Earth, or in the Air, or in Water. But howsoever, proceeded the<br/>Worm-men, although there is light in the bowels of the Earth, yet<br/>your Microscopes will do but little good there, by reason those<br/>Creatures that live under ground have not such an optick sense as<br/>those that live on the surface of the Earth: wherefore, unless you<br/>had such Glasses as are proper for their perception, your<br/>Microscopes will not be any ways advantagious to them. The Empress<br/>seem'd well pleased with this answer of the Worm-men; and asked<br/>them further, Whether Minerals and all other Creatures within the<br/>Earth were colourless? At which question they could not forbear<br/>laughing; and when the Empress asked the reason why they laught? We<br/>most humbly beg your Majesties pardon, replied they; for we could<br/>not chuse but laugh, when we heard of a colourless Body. Why, said<br/>the Empress, Colour is onely an accident, which is an immaterial<br/>thing, and has no being of it self, but in another body. Those,<br/>replied they, that informed your Majesty thus, surely their<br/>rational motions were very irregular; For how is it possible, that<br/>a Natural nothing can have a being in Nature? If it be no<br/>substance, it cannot have a being, and if no being, it is nothing;<br/>Wherefore the distinction&#160;between subsisting of it self, and<br/>subsisting in another body, is a meer nicety, and non-sense, for<br/>there is nothing in Nature that can subsist of, or by it self, (I<br/>mean singly) by reason all parts of Nature are composed in one<br/>body, and though they may be infinitely divided, commixed, and<br/>changed in their particular, yet in general, parts cannot be<br/>separated from parts as long as Nature lasts; nay, we might as<br/>probably affirm, that Infinite Nature would be as soon destroyed,<br/>as that one Atom could perish; and therefore your Majesty may<br/>firmly believe, that there is no Body without colour, nor no Colour<br/>without body; for colour, figure, place, magnitude, and body, are<br/>all but one thing, without any separation or abstraction from each<br/>other.<br/><br/>The Empress was so wonderfully taken with this Discourse of the<br/>Worm-men, that she not only pardoned the rudeness they committed in<br/>laughing at first at her question, but yielded a full assent to<br/>their opinion, which she thought the most rational that ever she<br/>had heard yet; and then proceeding in her questions, enquired<br/>further, whether they had observed any seminal principles within<br/>the Earth free from all dimensions and qualities, which produced<br/>Vegetables, Minerals, and the like? To which they answered, That<br/>concerning the seeds of Minerals, their sensitive perceptions had<br/>never observed any; but Vegetables had certain seeds out of which<br/>they were produced. Then&#160;she asked, whether those seeds of<br/>Vegetables lost their Species, that is, were annihilated in the<br/>production of their off-spring? To which they answered, That by an<br/>Annihilation, nothing could be produced, and that the seeds of<br/>Vegetables were so far from being annihilated in their productions,<br/>that they did rather numerously increase and multiply; for the<br/>division of one seed, said they, does produce numbers of seeds out<br/>of it self. But repli'd the Empress, A particular part cannot<br/>increase of it self. 'Tis true, answer'd they: but they increase<br/>not barely of themselves, but by joining and commixing with other<br/>parts, which do assist them in their productions, and by way of<br/>imitation form or figure their own parts into such or such<br/>particulars. Then, I pray inform me, said the Empress, what<br/>disguise those seeds put on, and how they do conceal themselves in<br/>their Transmutations? They answered, That seeds did no ways<br/>disguise or conceal, but rather divulge themselves in the<br/>multiplication of their off-spring; onely they did hide and conceal<br/>themselves from their sensitive perceptions so, that their<br/>figurative and productive motions were not perceptible by Animal<br/>Creatures. Again, the Empress asked them, whether there were any<br/>Non-beings within the Earth? To which they answered, That they<br/>never heard of any such thing; and that, if her Majesty would know<br/>the truth thereof, she must ask those Creatures that are called<br/>Immaterial spirits, which had a great affinity with<br/>Non-beings,&#160;and perhaps could give her a satisfactory answer<br/>to this question. Then she desired to be informed, What opinion<br/>they had of the beginning of Forms? They told her Majesty, That<br/>they did not understand what she meant by this expression; For,<br/>said they, there is no beginning in Nature, no not of Particulars;<br/>by reason Nature is Eternal and Infinite, and her particulars are<br/>subject to infinite changes and transmutations by vertue of their<br/>own Corporeal, figurative self-motions; so that there's nothing new<br/>in Nature, not properly a beginning of any thing. The Empress<br/>seem'd well satisfied with all those answers, and enquired further,<br/>Whether there was no Art used by those Creatures that live within<br/>the Earth? Yes, answered they: for the several parts of the Earth<br/>do join and assist each other in composition or framing of such or<br/>such particulars; and many times, there are factions and divisions;<br/>which cause productions of mixt Species; as, for example, weeds,<br/>instead of sweet flowres and useful fruits; but Gardeners and<br/>Husbandmen use often to decide their quarrels, and cause them to<br/>agree; which though it shews a kindness to the differing parties,<br/>yet 'tis a great prejudice to the Worms, and other Animal-<br/>Creatures that live under ground; for it most commonly causes their<br/>dissolution and ruine, at best they are driven out of their<br/>habitations. What, said the Empress, are not Worms produced out of<br/>the Earth? Their production in general, answered they, is<br/>like&#160;the production of all other Natural Creatures, proceeding<br/>from the corporeal figurative motions of Nature; but as for their<br/>particular productions, they are according to the nature of their<br/>Species; some are produced out of flowers, some out of roots, some<br/>out of fruits, some out of ordinary Earth. Then they are very<br/>ungrateful Children, replied the Empress, that they feed on their<br/>own Parents which gave them life. Their life, answered they, is<br/>their own, and not their Parents; for no part or creature of Nature<br/>can either give or take away life; but parts do onely assist and<br/>join with parts, either in dissolution or production of other Parts<br/>and Creatures.<br/><br/>After this, and several other Conferences, which the Empress<br/>held with the Worm-men, she dismissed them; and having taken much<br/>satisfaction in several of their Answers, encouraged them in their<br/>Studies and Observations. Then she made a Convocation of her<br/>Chymists, the Ape-men; and commanded them to give her an account of<br/>the several Transmutations which their Art was able to produce.<br/>They begun first with a long and tedious Discourse concerning the<br/>Primitive Ingredients of Natural bodies; and how, by their Art,<br/>they had found out the principles out of which they consist. But<br/>they did not all agree in their opinions; for some said, That the<br/>Principles of all Natural Bodies were the four Elements, Fire, Air,<br/>Water, Earth, out of which they were composed: Others<br/>rejected&#160;this Elementary commixture, and said, There were many<br/>Bodies out of which none of the four Elements could be extracted by<br/>any degree of Fire whatsoever; and that, on the other side, there<br/>were divers Bodies, whose resolution by Fire reduced them into more<br/>then four different Ingredients; and these affirmed, That the only<br/>principles of Natural Bodies were Salt, Sulphur, and Mercury:<br/>Others again declared, That none of the forementioned could be<br/>called the True Principles of Natural Bodies; but that by their<br/>industry and pains which they had taken in the Art of Chymistry,<br/>they had discovered, that all Natural Bodies were produced but from<br/>one Principle, which was Water; for all Vegetables, Minerals, and<br/>Animals, said they, are nothing else, but simple Water<br/>distinguished into various figures by the vertue of their Seeds.<br/>But after a great many debates and contentions about this Subject,<br/>the Empress being so much tired that she was not able to hear them<br/>any longer, imposed a general silence upon them, and then declared<br/>her self in this following Discourse.<br/><br/>I am too sensible of the pains you have taken in the Art of<br/>Chymistry, to discover the Principles of Natural Bodies, and wish<br/>they had been more profitably bestowed upon some other, then such<br/>experiments; for both by my own Contemplation, and the Observations<br/>which I have made by my rational &amp; sensitive perception upon<br/>Nature, and her works, I find,&#160;that Nature is but one Infinite<br/>Self-moving Body, which by the vertue of its self-motion, is<br/>divided into Infinite parts, which parts being restless, undergo<br/>perpetual changes and transmutations by their infinite compositions<br/>and divisions. Now, if this be so, as surely, according to regular<br/>Sense and Reason, it appears no otherwise; it is in vain to look<br/>for primary Ingredients, or constitutive principles of Natural<br/>Bodies, since there is no more but one Universal Principle of<br/>Nature, to wit, self-moving Matter, which is the onely cause of all<br/>natural effects. Next, I desire you to consider, that Fire is but a<br/>particular Creature, or effect of Nature, and occasions not onely<br/>different effects in several Bodies, but on some Bodies has no<br/>power at all; witness Gold, which never could be brought yet to<br/>change its interior figure by the art of Fire; and if this be so,<br/>Why should you be so simple as to believe that Fire can shew you<br/>the Principles of Nature? and that either the Four Elements, or<br/>Water onely, or Salt Sulphur and Mercury, all which are no more but<br/>particular effects and Creatures of Nature, should be the Primitive<br/>Ingredients or Principles of all Natural Bodies? Wherefore, I will<br/>not have you to take more pains, and waste your time in such<br/>fruitless attempts, but be wiser hereafter, and busie your selves<br/>with such Experiments as may be beneficial to the publick.<br/><br/>The Empress having thus declared her mind to the Ape-men, and<br/>given them better Instructions then perhaps they expected, not<br/>knowing that her Majesty had such great and able judgment in<br/>Natural Philosophy, had several conferences with them concerning<br/>Chymical Preperations, which for brevities sake, I'le forbear to<br/>reherse: Amongst the rest, she asked, how it came that the Imperial<br/>Race appear'd so young, and yet was reported to have lived so long;<br/>some of them two, some three, and some four hundred years? and<br/>whether it was by Nature, or a special Divine blessing? To which<br/>they answered, That there was a certain Rock in the parts of that<br/>World, which contained the Golden Sands, which Rock was hallow<br/>within, and did produce a Gum that was a hundred years before it<br/>came to its full strength and perfection; this Gum, said they, if<br/>it be held in a warm hand, will dissolve into an Oyl, the effects<br/>whereof are following: It being given every day for some certain<br/>time, to an old decayed man, in the bigness of a little Pea, will<br/>first make him spit for a week, or more; after this, it will cause<br/>Vomits of Flegm; and after that it will bring forth by vomits,<br/>humors of several colours; first of a pale yellow, then of a deep<br/>yellow, then of a green, and lastly of a black colour; and each of<br/>these humours have a several taste, some are fresh, some salt, some<br/>sower, some bitter, and so forth; neither do all these Vomits make<br/>them sick, but they come out on a sudden, and&#160;unawares,<br/>without any pain or trouble to the patient: And after it hath done<br/>all these mentioned effects, and clear'd both the Stomack and<br/>several other parts of the body, then it works upon the Brain, and<br/>brings forth of the Nose such kinds of humors as it did out of the<br/>Mouth, and much after the same manner; then it will purge by stool,<br/>then by urine, then by sweat, and lastly by bleeding at the Nose,<br/>and the Emeroids; all which effects it will perform within the<br/>space of six weeks, or a little more; for it does not work very<br/>strongly, but gently, and by degrees: Lastly, when it has done all<br/>this, it will make the body break out into a thick Scab, and cause<br/>both Hair, Teeth, and Nails to come off; which scab being arrived<br/>to its full maturity, opens first along the back, and comes off all<br/>in a piece like armour, and all this is done within the space of<br/>four months. After this the Patient is wrapt into a Cere- cloth,<br/>prepared of certain Gums and Juices, wherein he continues until the<br/>time of nine Months be expired from the first beginning of the<br/>cure, which is the time of a Childs formation in the Womb. In the<br/>mean while, his diet is nothing else but Eagles-eggs, and<br/>Hinds-milk; and after the Cere-cloth is taken away, he will appear<br/>of the age of Twenty, both in shape, and strength. The weaker sort<br/>of this Gum is soveraign in healing of wounds, and curing of slight<br/>distempers. But this is also to be observed, that none of the<br/>Imperial race does use any other drink but Lime-water,<br/>or&#160;water in which Lime-stone is immerged; their meat is<br/>nothing else but Fowl of several sorts, their recreations are many,<br/>but chiefly Hunting.<br/><br/>
