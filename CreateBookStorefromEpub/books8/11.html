This Relation amazed the Empress very much; for though in the<br/>World she came from, she had heard great reports of the<br/>Philosophers-stone, yet had she not heard of any that had ever<br/>found it out, which made her believe that it was but a Chymera; she<br/>called also to mind, that there had been in the same World a Man<br/>who had a little Stone which cured all kinds of Diseases outward<br/>and inward, according it was applied; and that a famous Chymist had<br/>found out a certain Liquor called Alkahest, which by the vertue of<br/>its own fire, consumed all Diseases; but she had never heard of a<br/>Medicine that could renew old Age, and render it beautiful,<br/>vigorous and strong: Nor would she have so easily believed it, had<br/>it been a medicine prepared by Art; for she knew that Art, being<br/>Natures Changeling, was not able to produce such a powerful effect;<br/>but being that the Gum did grow naturally, she did not so much<br/>scruple at it; for she knew that Nature's Works are so various and<br/>wonderful, that no particular Creature is able to trace her<br/>ways.<br/><br/>The Conferences of the Chymists being finished, the Empress made<br/>an Assembly of her Galenical Physicians, her Herbalists and<br/>Anatomists; and first she enquired of her Herbalists the particular<br/>effects of several Herbs and Drugs, and whence they<br/>proceeded?&#160;To which they answered, that they could, for the<br/>most part, tell her Majesty the vertues and operations of them, but<br/>the particular causes of their effects were unknown; onely thus<br/>much they could say, that their operations and vertues were<br/>generally caused by their proper inherent, corporeal, figurative<br/>motions, which being infinitely various in Infinite Nature, did<br/>produce infinite several effects. And it is observed, said they,<br/>that Herbs and Drugs are as wise in their operations, as Men in<br/>their words and actions; nay, wiser; and their effects are more<br/>certain then Men in their opinions; for though they cannot<br/>discourse like Men, yet have they Sense and Reason, as well as Men;<br/>for the discursive faculty is but a particular effect of Sense and<br/>Reason in some particular Creatures, to wit, Men, and not a<br/>principle of Nature, and argues often more folly then wisdom. The<br/>Empress asked, Whether they could not by a composition and<br/>commixture of other Drugs make them work other effects then they<br/>did, used by themselves? They answered, That they could make them<br/>produce artificial effects, but not alter their inherent, proper<br/>and particular natures.<br/><br/>Then the Empress commanded her Anatomists to dissect such kinds<br/>of Creatures as are called Monsters. But they answered her Majesty,<br/>That it would be but an unprofitable and useless work, and hinder<br/>their better imployments; for when we dissect dead Animals, said<br/>they, it is for no other end, but to observe what&#160;defects and<br/>distempers they had, that we may cure the like in living ones, so<br/>that all our care and industry concerns onely the preservation of<br/>Mankind; but we hope your Majesty will not preserve Monsters, which<br/>are most commonly destroyed, except it be for novelty: Neither will<br/>the dissection of Monsters prevent the errors of Nature's irregular<br/>actions; for by dissecting some, we cannot prevent the production<br/>of others; so that our pains and labour will be to no purpose,<br/>unless to satisfie the vain curiosities of inquisitive men. The<br/>Empress replied, That such dissections would be very beneficial to<br/>Experimental Philosophers. If Experimental Philosophers, answer'd<br/>they, do spend their time in such useless Inspections, they waste<br/>it in vain, and have nothing but their labour for their pains.<br/><br/>Lastly, her Majesty had some Conferences with the Galenick<br/>Physicians about several Diseases, and amongst the rest, desired to<br/>know the cause and nature of Apoplexies, and the spotted Plague.<br/>They answered, That a deadly Apoplexy was a dead palsie of the<br/>Brain, and the spotted Plague was a Gangrene of the Vital parts:<br/>and as the Gangrene of outward parts did strike inwardly; so the<br/>Gangrene of inward parts, did break forth outwardly: which is the<br/>cause, said they, that as soon as the spots appear, death follows;<br/>for then it is an infallible sign, that the body is throughout<br/>infected with a Gangrene, which is a spreadingevil; but some<br/>Gangrenes do spread more suddenly than others, and of all sorts of<br/>Gangrenes, the Plaguy- Gangrene is the most infectious; for other<br/>Gangrenes infect but the next adjoining parts of one particular<br/>body, and having killed that same Creature, go no further, but<br/>cease; when as, the Gangrene of the Plague, infects not onely the<br/>adjoining parts of one particular Creature, but also those that are<br/>distant; that is, one particular body infects another, and so<br/>breeds a Universal Contagion. But the Empress being very desirous<br/>to know in what manner the Plague was propagated, and became so<br/>contagious, asked, Whether it went actually out of one body into<br/>another? To which they answered, That it was a great dispute<br/>amongst the Learned of their Profession, Whether it came by a<br/>division and composition of parts; that is, by expiration and<br/>inspiration; or whether it was caused by imitation: some<br/>Experimental Philosophers, said they, will make us believe, that by<br/>the help of their Microscopes, they have observed the Plague to be<br/>a body of little Flies like Atoms, which go out of one body into<br/>another, through the sensitive passages; but the most experienced<br/>and wisest of our society, have rejected this opinion as a<br/>ridiculous fancy, and do, for the most part, believe, that it is<br/>caused by an imitation of Parts; so that the motions of some parts<br/>which are sound, do imitate the motions of those that are infected<br/>and that by this means, the Plague becomes contagions, and<br/>spreading.<br/><br/>The Empress having hitherto spent her time in the Examination of<br/>the Bird- Fish- Worm- and Ape- men, &amp;c. and received several<br/>Intelligences from their several imployments; at last had a mind to<br/>divert her self after her serious Discourses, and therefore she<br/>sent for the Spider-men, which were her Mathematicians, the<br/>Lice-men which were here Geometricians, and the Magpie- Parrot- and<br/>Jackdaw-men, which were her Orators and Logicians. The Spider-men<br/>came first, and presented her Majesty with a table full of<br/>Mathematical points, lines, and figures of all sorts, of squares,<br/>circles, triangles, and the like; which the Empress,<br/>notwithstanding that she had a very ready wit, and quick<br/>apprehension, could not understand; but the more she endeavoured to<br/>learn, the more was she confounded: Whether they did ever square<br/>the Circle, I cannot exactly tell, nor whether they could make<br/>imaginary points and lines; but this I dare say, That their points<br/>and lines were so slender, small and thin, that they seem'd next to<br/>Imaginary. The Mathematicians were in great esteem with the<br/>Empress, as being not onely the chief Tutors and Instructors in<br/>many Arts, but some of them excellent Magicians and Informers of<br/>spirits, which was the reason their Characters were so abstruse and<br/>intricate, that the Emperess knew not what to make of them. There<br/>is so much to learn in your Art, said she, that I can neither spare<br/>time from other affairs to busie my self in your&#160;profession;<br/>nor, if I could, do I think I should ever be able to understand<br/>your Imaginary points, lines and figures, because they are<br/>Non-beings.<br/><br/>Then came the Lice-men, and endeavoured to measure all things to<br/>a hairs-breadth, and weigh them to an Atom; but their weights would<br/>seldom agree, especially in the weighing of Air, which they found a<br/>task impossible to be done; at which the Empress began to be<br/>displeased, and told them, that there was neither Truth nor Justice<br/>in their Profession; and so dissolved their society.<br/><br/>After this, the Empress was resolved to hear the Magpie- Parrot-<br/>and Jackdaw-men, which were her professed Orators and Logicians;<br/>whereupon one of the Parrot-men rose with great formality, and<br/>endeavoured to make an Eloquent Speech before her Majesty; but<br/>before he had half ended, his arguments and divisions being so<br/>many, that they caused a great confusion in his brain, he could not<br/>go forward, but was forced to retire backward, with great disgrace<br/>both to himself, and the whole society; and although one of his<br/>brethren endeavoured to second him by another speech, yet was he as<br/>far to seek, as the former. At which the Empress appear'd not a<br/>little troubled, and told them, That they followed too much the<br/>Rules of Art, and confounded themselves with too nice formalities<br/>and distinctions; but since I know, said she, that you are a people<br/>who have naturally voluble tongues,&#160;and good memories; I<br/>desire you to consider more the subject you speak of, then your<br/>artificial periods, connexions and parts of speech, and leave the<br/>rest to your natural Eloquence; which they did, and so became very<br/>eminent Orators.<br/><br/>Lastly, her Imperial Majesty being desirous to know what<br/>progress her Logicians had made in the Art of disputing, Commanded<br/>them to argue upon several Themes or Subjects; which they did; and<br/>having made a very nice discourse of Logistical terms and<br/>propositions, entred into a dispute by way of Syllogistical<br/>Arguments, through all the Figures and Modes: One began with an<br/>Argument of the first Mode of the first Figure, thus: Every<br/>Politician is wise: Every Knave is a Politician, Therefore every<br/>Knave is wise.<br/><br/>Another contradicted him with a Syllogism of the second Mode of<br/>the same Figure, thus: No Politician is wise: Every Knave is a<br/>Politician, Therefore no Knave is wise.<br/><br/>The third made an Argument in the third Mode of the same Figure,<br/>after this manner: Every Politician is wise: some Knaves are<br/>Politicians, Therefore some Knaves are wise.<br/><br/>The Fourth concluded with a Syllogism in the fourth Mode of the<br/>same Figure, thus; No Politician is wise: some Knaves are<br/>Politicians, Therefore some Knaves are not wise.<br/>
