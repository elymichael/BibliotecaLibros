<br/><br/><br/>The Epilogue to the Reader.<br/><br/><br/>By this Poetical Description, you may perceive, that my ambition<br/>is not onely to be Empress, but Authoress of a whole World; and<br/>that the Worlds I have made, both the Blazing- and the other<br/>Philosophical World, mentioned in the first part of this<br/>Description, are framed and composed of the most pure, that is, the<br/>Rational parts of Matter, which are the parts of my Mind; which<br/>Creation was more easily and suddenly effected, than the Conquests<br/>of the two famous Monarchs of the World. Alexander and Cesar.<br/>Neither have I made such disturbances, and caused so many<br/>dissolutions of particulars, otherwise named deaths, as they did;<br/>for I have destroyed but some few men in a little Boat, which dyed<br/>through the extremity of cold, and that by the hand of Justice,<br/>which was necessitated to punish their crime of stealing away a<br/>young and beauteous Lady. And in the formation of those Worlds, I<br/>take more delight and glory, then ever Alexander or Cesar did in<br/>conquering this terrestrial world; and though I have made my<br/>Blazing-world a Peaceable World, allowing it but one&#160;Religion,<br/>one Language, and one Government; yet could I make another World,<br/>as full of Factions, Divisions and Warrs, as this is of Peace and<br/>Tranquility; and the Rational figures of my Mind might express as<br/>much courage to fight, as Hector and Achilles had; and be as wise<br/>as Nestor, as; Eloquent as Ulysses, and be as beautiful as Hellen.<br/>But I esteeming Peace before Warr, Wit before Policy, Honesty<br/>before Beauty; instead of the figures of Alexander, Cesar, Hector,<br/>Achilles, Nestor, Ulysses, Hellen, &amp;c. chose rather the figure<br/>of Honest Margaret Newcastle, which now I would not change for all<br/>this Terrestrial World; and if any should like the World I have<br/>made, and be willing to be my Subjects, they may imagine themselves<br/>such, and they are such, I mean in their Minds, Fancies or<br/>Imaginations; but if they cannot endure to be Subjects, they may<br/>create Worlds of their own, and Govern themselves as they please.<br/>But yet let them have a care, not to prove unjust Usurpers, and to<br/>rob me of mine: for, concerning the Philosophical-world, I am<br/>Empress of it my self; and as for the Blazing-world, it having an<br/>Empress already, who rules it with great Wisdom and Conduct, which<br/>Empress is my dear Platonick Friend; I shall never prove so unjust,<br/>treacherous and unworthy to her, as to disturb her Government, much<br/>less to depose her from her Imperial Throne, for the sake of any<br/>other, but rather chuse to create another World for another<br/>Friend.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
