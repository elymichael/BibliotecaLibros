<br/>Thus the Empress did not onely save her Native Country, but made<br/>it the Absolute Monarchy of all that World; and both the effects of<br/>her Power and her Beauty, did kindle a great desire in all the<br/>greatest Princes to see her; who hearing that she was resolved to<br/>return into her own Blazing-World, they all entreated the favour,<br/>that they might wait on her Majesty before she went. The Empress<br/>sent word, That she should be glad to grant their Requests; but<br/>having no other place of Reception for them, she desired that they<br/>would be pleased to come into the open Seas with their Ships, and<br/>make a Circle of a pretty large compass, and then her own Ships<br/>should meet them, and close up the Circle, and she would present<br/>her self to the view of all those that came to see her: Which<br/>Answer was joyfully received by all the mentioned Princes, who<br/>came, some sooner, and some later, each according to the distance<br/>of his Countrey, and the length of the voyage. And being all met in<br/>the form and manner aforesaid, the Empress appeared upon the face<br/>of the Water in her Imperial Robes; in some part of her hair, near<br/>her face, she had placed some of the Starr- Stone, which added such<br/>a luster and glory to it, that it caused a great admiration in all<br/>that were present, who believed her to be some Celestial Creature,<br/>or&#160;rather an uncreated Goddess, and they all had a desire to<br/>worship her; for surely, said they, no mortal creature can have<br/>such a splendid and transcendent beauty, nor can any have so great<br/>a power as she has, to walk upon the Waters, and to destroy<br/>whatever she pleases, not onely whole Nations, but a whole<br/>World.<br/><br/>The Empress expressed to her own Countrymen, who were also her<br/>Interpreters to the rest of the Princes that were present, That she<br/>would give them an Entertainment at the darkest time of Night:<br/>Which being come, the Fire-Stones were lighted, which made both Air<br/>and Seas appear of a bright shining flame, insomuch that they put<br/>all Spectators into an extream fright, who verily believed they<br/>should all be destroyed; which the Empress perceiving, caused all<br/>the Lights of the Fire-Stones to be put out, and onely shewed her<br/>self in her Garments of Light. The Bird-men carried her upon their<br/>backs into the Air, and there she appear'd as glorious as the Sun.<br/>Then she was set down upon the Seas again, and presently there was<br/>heard the most melodious and sweetest Consort of Voices, as ever<br/>was heard out of the Seas, which was made by the Fish- men; this<br/>Consort was answered by another, made by the Bird-men in the Air,<br/>so that it seem'd as if Sea and Air had spoke, and answered each<br/>other by way of Singing-Dialogues, or after the manner&#160;of<br/>those Playes that are acted by singing-Voices.<br/><br/>But when it was upon break of day, the Empress ended her<br/>Entertainment, and at full day-light all the Princes perceived that<br/>she went into the Ship wherein the Prince and Monarch of her Native<br/>Country was, the King of Esfi, with whom she had several<br/>Conferences; and having assured Him of the readiness of her<br/>Assistance whensoever he required it, telling Him withal, That she<br/>wanted no Intelligence, she went forth again upon the Waters, and<br/>being in the midst of the Circle made by those Ships that were<br/>present, she desired them to draw somewhat nearer, that they might<br/>hear her speak; which being done, she declared her self in this<br/>following manner:<br/><br/>Great, Heroick, and Famous Monarchs, I come hither to assist the<br/>King of Esfi against his Enemies, He being unjustly assaulted by<br/>many several Nations, which would fain take away His Hereditary<br/>Rights, and Prerogatives of the Narrow Seas; at which Unjustice,<br/>Heaven was much displeased, and for the Injuries He received from<br/>His Enemies, rewarded Him with an Absolute Power, so that now he is<br/>become the Head-Monarch of all this World; which Power, though you<br/>may envy, yet you can no wayes hinder Him; for all those that<br/>endeavour to resist His Power, shall onely get Loss for their<br/>Labour, and no Victory for their Profit. Wherefore my advice to you<br/>all is, To pay him Tribute justly and truly, that you may&#160;live<br/>Peaceably and Happily, and be rewarded with the Blessings of<br/>Heaven: which I wish you from my Soul.<br/><br/>After the Empress had thus finished her Speech to the Princes of<br/>the several Nations of that World, she desired that in their Ships<br/>might fall back; which being done, her own Fleet came into the<br/>Circle, without any visible assistance of Sails or Tide; and her<br/>self being entred into her own Ship, the whole Fleet sunk<br/>immediately into the bottom of the Seas, and left all the<br/>Spectators in a deep amazement; neither would she suffer any of her<br/>Ships to come above the Waters, until she arrived into the<br/>Blazing-World.<br/><br/>In time of the Voyage, both the Empress's and the Duchess's<br/>Soul, were very gay and merry; and sometimes they would converse<br/>very seriously with each other. Amongst the rest of their<br/>discourses, the Duchess said, she wondred much at one thing, which<br/>was, That since her Majesty had found out a passage out of the<br/>Blazing-World, into the World she came from, she did not enrich<br/>that part of the World where she was born, at least her own Family,<br/>though she had enough to enrich the whole World. The Empress's Soul<br/>answered, That she loved her Native Countrey, and her own Family,<br/>as well as any Creature could do; and that this was the reason why<br/>she would not enrich them: for, said she, not only particular<br/>Families or Nations,&#160;but all the World, their Natures are<br/>such, that much Gold, and great store of Riches, makes them mad;<br/>insomuch as they endeavour to destroy each other for Gold or Riches<br/>sake. The reason thereof is, said the Duchess, that they have too<br/>little Gold and Riches, which makes them so eager to have it. No,<br/>replied the Empress's Soul, their particular Covetousness, is<br/>beyond all the wealth of the richest World, and the more Riches<br/>they have, the more Covetous they are; for their Covetousness is<br/>Infinite. But, said she, I would there could a Passage be found out<br/>of the Blazing-World, into the World whence you came, and I would<br/>willingly give you as much Riches as you desir'd. The Duchess's<br/>Soul gave her Majesty humble thanks for her great Favour; and told<br/>her, that she was not covetous, nor desir'd any more wealth than<br/>what her Lord and Husband had before the Civil-Warrs. Neither, said<br/>she, should I desire it for my own, but my Lord's Posterities sake.<br/>Well, said the Empress, I'le command my Fish-men to use all their<br/>Skill and Industry to find out a Passage into that World which your<br/>Lord and Husband is in. I do verily believe, answered the Duchess,<br/>that there will be no Passage found into that World; but if there<br/>were any, I should not Petition your Majesty for Gold and Jewels,<br/>but only for the Elixir that grows in the midst of the Golden<br/>Sands, for to preserve Life and Health; but without a Passage, it<br/>is impossible to carry away any&#160;of it: for, whatsoever is<br/>Material, cannot travel like Immaterial Beings, such as Souls and<br/>Spirits are. Neither do Souls require any such thing that might<br/>revive them, or prolong their Lives, by reason they are<br/>unalterable: for, were Souls like Bodies, then my Soul might have<br/>had the benefit of that Natural Elixir that grows in your<br/>Blazing-World. I wish earnestly, said the Empress, that a Passage<br/>might be found, and then both your Lord and your self, should<br/>neither want Wealth, nor Long-life: nay, I love you so well, that I<br/>would make you as Great and Powerful a Monarchess, as I am of the<br/>Blazing-World. The Duchess's Soul humbly thank'd her Majesty, and<br/>told her, That she acknowledged and esteemed her Love beyond all<br/>things that are in Nature.<br/><br/>After this Discourse, they had many other Conferences, which for<br/>brevity's sake I'le forbear to rehearse. At last, after several<br/>Questions which the Empress's Soul asked the Duchess, she desired<br/>to know the reason why she did take such delight, when she was<br/>joyned to her Body, in being singular both in Accoustrements,<br/>Behaviour, and Discourse? The Duchess's Soul answered, she<br/>confessed that it was extravagant, and beyond what was usual and<br/>ordinary: but yet her ambition being such, that she would not be<br/>like others in any thing, if it were possible, I endeavour, said<br/>she, to be as singular as I can: for, it argues but a mean Nature,<br/>to imitate others: and though I do not love to be&#160;imitated, if<br/>I can possibly avoid it; yet, rather than imitate others, I should<br/>chuse to be imitated by others: for my Nature is such, that I had<br/>rather appear worse in Singularity, than better in the Mode. If you<br/>were not a great Lady, replied the Empress, you would never pass in<br/>the World for a wise Lady: for, the World would say, your<br/>Singularities are Vanities. The Duchess's Soul answered, she did<br/>not at all regard the Censure of this, or any other Age, concerning<br/>Vanities: but, said she, neither this present, nor any of the<br/>future Ages, can or will truly say, that I am not Vertuous and<br/>Chast: for I am confident, all that were, or are acquainted with<br/>me, and all the Servants which ever I had, will or can upon their<br/>oaths declare my actions no otherwise than Vertuous: and certainly,<br/>there's none even of the meanest Degree, which have not their Spies<br/>and Witnesses, much more those of the Nobler sort, which seldom or<br/>never are without Attendants; so that their Faults (if they have<br/>any) will easily be known, and as easily be divulged. Wherefore,<br/>happy are those Natures that are Honest, Vertuous, and Noble; not<br/>only happy to themselves, but happy to their Families. But, said<br/>the Empress, if you glory so much in your Honesty and Vertue, how<br/>comes it that you plead for Dishonest and Wicked persons, in your<br/>Writings? The Duchess answered, It was only to shew her Wit, not<br/>her Nature.<br/><br/>At last the Empress arrived into the Blazing-world, and coming<br/>to her Imperial Palace, you may sooner imagine than expect that I<br/>should express the joy which the Emperor had at her safe return;<br/>for he loved her beyond his Soul; and there was no love lost, for<br/>the Empress equal'd his Affection with no less love to him. After<br/>the time of rejoicing with each other, the Duchess's Soul begg'd<br/>leave to return to her Noble Lord: But the Emperor desired, that<br/>before she departed, she would see how he had employed his time in<br/>the Empress's absence; for he had built Stables and Riding-Houses,<br/>and desired to have Horses of Manage, such as, according to the<br/>Empress's Relation, the Duke of Newcastlehad: The Emperor enquired<br/>of the Duchess, the Form and Structure of her Lord and Husband's<br/>Stables and Riding-House. The Duchess answer'd his Majesty, That<br/>they were but plain and ordinary; but, said she, had my Lord<br/>Wealth, I am sure he would not spare it, in rendring his Buildings<br/>as Noble as could be made. Hereupon the Emperor shewed the Duchess<br/>the Stables he had built, which were most stately and magnificent;<br/>among the rest, there was one double Stable that held a Hundred<br/>Horses on a side, the main Building was of Gold, lined with several<br/>sorts of precious Materials; the Roof was Arched with Agats, the<br/>sides of the Walls were lined with Cornelian, the Floor was paved<br/>with Amber, the Mangers&#160;were Mother of Pearl; the Pillars, as<br/>also the middle Isle or Walk of the Stables, were of Crystal; the<br/>Front and Gate was of Turquois, most neatly cut and carved. The<br/>Riding-House was lined with Saphirs, Topases, and the like; the<br/>Floor was all of Golden-Sand so finely sifted, that it was<br/>extreamly soft, and not in the least hurtful to the Horses feet,<br/>and the Door and Frontispiece was of Emeralds curiously carved.<br/><br/>After the view of these Glorious and Magnificent Buildings,<br/>which the Duchess's Soul was much delighted withall, she resolved<br/>to take her leave; but the Emperor desired her to stay yet some<br/>short time more, for they both loved her company so well, that they<br/>were unwilling to have her depart so soon: several Conferences and<br/>Discourses pass'd between them; amongst the rest, the Emperor<br/>desir'd her advice how to set up a Theatre for Plays. The Duchess<br/>confessed her Ignorance in this Art, telling his Majesty that she<br/>knew nothing of erecting Theatres or Scenes, but what she had by an<br/>Immaterial Observation, when she was with the Empress's Soul in the<br/>chief City of E. Entring into one of their Theatres, whereof the<br/>Empress could give as much account to his Majesty, as her self. But<br/>both the Emperor and the Empress told the Duchess, That she could<br/>give directions how to make Plays. The Duchess answered, That she<br/>had as little skill to form a Play after the Mode, as she had to<br/>paint or make a&#160;Scene for shew. But you have made Plays,<br/>replied the Empress: Yes, answered the Duchess, I intended them for<br/>Plays; but the Wits of these present times condemned them as<br/>uncapable of being represented or acted, because they were not made<br/>up according to the Rules of Art; though I dare say, That the<br/>Descriptions are as good as any they have writ. The Emperor asked,<br/>Whether the Property of Plays were not to describe the several<br/>Humours, Actions and Fortunes of Mankind? 'Tis so, answered the<br/>Duchess. Why then, replied the Emperor, the natural Humours,<br/>Actions and Fortunes of Mankind, are not done by the Rules of Art:<br/>But, said the Duchess, it is the Art and Method of our Wits to<br/>despise all Descriptions of Wit, Humour, Actions and Fortunes that<br/>are without such Artificial Rules. The Emperor asked, Are those<br/>good Plays that are made so Methodically and Artificially? The<br/>Duchess answer'd, They were Good according to the Judgment of the<br/>Age, or Mode of the Nation, but not according to her Judgment: for<br/>truly, said she, in my Opinion, their Plays will prove a Nursery of<br/>whining Lovers, and not an Academy or School for Wise, Witty, Noble<br/>and well-behaved men. But I, replied the Emperor, desire such a<br/>Theatre as may make wise Men; and will have such Descriptions as<br/>are Natural, not Artificial. If your Majesty be of that Opinion,<br/>said the Duchess's&#160;Soul, then my Playes may be acted in your<br/>Blazing- World, when they cannot be acted in the Blinking-World of<br/>Wit; and the next time I come to visit your Majesty, I shall<br/>endeavour to order your Majesty's Theatre, to present such Playes<br/>as my Wit is capable to make. Then the Empress told the Duchess,<br/>That she loved a foolish Farse added to a wise Play. The Duchess<br/>answered, That no World in Nature had fitter Creatures for it than<br/>the Blazing-World: for, said she, the Lowse- men, the Bird-men, the<br/>Spider- and Fox-men, the Ape-men and Satyrs appear in a Farse<br/>extraordinary pleasant.<br/><br/>Hereupon both the Emperor and Empress intreated the Duchess's<br/>Soul to stay so long with them, till she had ordered her Theatre,<br/>and made Playes and Farses fit for them; for they onely wanted that<br/>sort of Recreation: but the Duchess's Soul begg'd their Majesties<br/>to give her leave to go into her Native World; for she long'd to be<br/>with her dear Lord and Husband, promising, that after a short time<br/>she would return again. Which being granted, though with much<br/>difficulty, she took her leave with all Civility and Respect, and<br/>so departed from their Majesties.<br/><br/>
