Then she inquired, Whether there was no mystery in Numbers? No<br/>other mystery, answered the Spirits, but reckoning or counting; for<br/>Numbers are onely marks of remembrance. But what do you think of<br/>the Number of Four, said she, which Cabbalists make such ado<br/>withal, and of the Number of Ten, when they say that Ten is all,<br/>and that all Numbers are virtually comprehended in Four? We think,<br/>answered they, that Cabbalists have nothing else to do but to<br/>trouble their heads with such useless Fancies; for naturally there<br/>is no such thing as prime or all in Numbers; nor is there any other<br/>mystery in Numbers, but what Man's fancy makes; but what Men call<br/>Prime, or All, we do not know, because they do not agree in the<br/>number of their opinion. Then the Empress asked, Whether the number<br/>of six was a symbole of Matrimony, as being made up of Male and<br/>Femal, for two into three is six. If any number can be a symbole of<br/>Matrimony, answered the Spirits, it is not Six, but Two; if two may<br/>be allowed to be a Number: for the act of Matrimony is made up of<br/>two joined in one. she asked again, What they said to the number of<br/>Seven? whether it was not an Embleme of God, because Cabbalists<br/>say, That it is neither begotten, nor begets any other Number?<br/>There can be no Embleme of God, answered the Spirits; for if we do<br/>not know what God is, how can we make an Embleme of him? Nor is<br/>there any Number in God, for God is the perfection Himself;<br/>but&#160;Numbers are imperfect; and as for the begetting of<br/>numbers, it is done by Multiplication and Addition; but<br/>Substraction is as a kind of death to Numbers. If there be no<br/>mystery in Numbers, replied the Empress then it is in vain to refer<br/>to the Creation of the World to certain Numbers, as Cabbalists do.<br/>The onely mystery of Numbers, answered they, concerning the<br/>Creation of the World, is, that as Numbers do multiply, so does the<br/>World. The Empress asked, how far Numbers did multiply? The Spirits<br/>answered, to Infinite. Why, said she, Infinite cannot be reckoned,<br/>nor numbred. No more, answered they, can the parts of the Universe;<br/>for God's Creation, being an Infinite action, as proceeding from an<br/>Infinite Power, could not rest upon a finite Number of Creatures,<br/>were it never so great. But leaving the mystery of Numbers,<br/>proceeded the Empress, Let me now desire you to inform me, Whether<br/>the Suns and Planets were generated by the Heavens, or Æthereal<br/>Matter? The Spirits answered, That the Stars and Planets were of<br/>the same matter which the Heavens, the Æther, and all other Natural<br/>Creatures did consist of; but whether they were generated by the<br/>Heavens or Æther, they could not tell: if they be, said they, they<br/>are not like their Parents; for the Sun, Stars, and Planets, are<br/>more splendorous then the Æther, as also more solid and constant in<br/>their motions: But put the case, the Stars and Planets were<br/>generated by the Heavens, and&#160;the Æthereal Matter; the<br/>question then would be, Out of what these are generated or<br/>produced? If these be created out of nothing, and not generated out<br/>of something, then it is probable the Sun, Stars and Planets are so<br/>too; nay, it is more probable of the Stars, and Planets, then of<br/>the Heavens, or the fluid Æther, by reason the Stars and Planets<br/>seem to be further off from Mortality, then the particular parts of<br/>the Æther; for no doubt but the parts of the Æthereal Matter, alter<br/>into several forms, which we do not perceive of the Stars and<br/>Planets. The Empress asked further, Whether they could give her<br/>information of the three principles of Man, according to the<br/>doctrine of the Platonists; as first of the Intellect, Spirit, or<br/>Divine Light. 2. Of the Soul of Man her self: and 3. Of the Image<br/>of the Soul, that is, her vital operation on the body? The Spirits<br/>answered, That they did not understand these three distinctions,<br/>but that they seem'd to corporeal sense and reason, as if they were<br/>three several bodies, or three several corporeal actions; however,<br/>said they, they are intricate conceptions of irregular Fancies. If<br/>you do not understand them, replied the Empress, how shall human<br/>Creatures do then? Many, both of your modern and ancient<br/>Philosophers, answered the Spirits, endeavour to go beyond Sense<br/>and Reason, which makes them commit absurdities; for no corporeal<br/>Creature can go beyond Sense and Reason; no not weSpirits, as long<br/>as we are in our corporeal Vehicles. Then the Empress asked them,<br/>Whether there were any Atheists in the World? The Spirits answered,<br/>That there were no more Atheists then what Cabbalists make. she<br/>asked them further, Whether Spirits were of a globous or round<br/>Figure? They answered, That Figure belonged to body, but they being<br/>immaterial, had no Figure. she asked again, Whether Spirits were<br/>not like Water or Fire? They answered, that Water and Fire was<br/>material, were it the purest and most refined that ever could be;<br/>nay, were it above the Heavens: But we are no more like Water or<br/>Fire, said they, then we are like Earth; but our Vehicles are of<br/>several forms, figures and degrees of substances. Then she desired<br/>to know, Whether their Vehicles were made of Air? Yes, answered the<br/>Spirits, some of our Vehicles are of thin Air. Then I suppose,<br/>replied the Empress, That those airy Vehicles, are your corporeal<br/>Summer-suits. she asked further, Whether the Spirits had not<br/>ascending and descending-motions, as well as other Creatures? They<br/>answered, That properly there was no ascension or descension in<br/>Infinite Nature, but onely in relation to particular parts; and as<br/>for us Spirits, said they, We can neither ascend nor descend<br/>without corporeal Vehicles; nor can our Vehicles ascend or descend,<br/>but according to their several shapes and figures, for there can be<br/>no motion without body. The Empress asked&#160;them further,<br/>Whether there was not a World of Spirits, as well as there is of<br/>Material Creatures? No, answered they; for the word World implies a<br/>quantity or multitude of corporeal Creatures, but we being<br/>Immaterial, can make no World of Spirits. Then she desired to be<br/>informed when Spirits were made? We do not know, answered they, how<br/>and when we were made, nor are we much inquisitive after it; nay,<br/>if we did, it would be no benefit, neither for us, nor for you<br/>Mortals to know it. The Empress replied, That Cabbalists and Divine<br/>Philosophers said, Mens rational Souls were Immaterial, and stood<br/>as much in need of corporeal Vehicles, as Spirits did. If this be<br/>so, answered the Spirits, then you are Hermaphrodites of Nature;<br/>but your Cabbalists are mistaken, for they take the purest and<br/>subtilest parts of Matter, for Immaterial Spirits. Then the Empress<br/>asked, When the Souls of Mortals went out of their Bodies, whether<br/>they went to Heaven or Hell; or whether, they remained in airy<br/>Vehicles? God's Justice and Mercy, answered they, is perfect, and<br/>not imperfect; but if you Mortals will have Vehicles for your<br/>Souls, and a place that is between Heaven and Hell, it must be<br/>Purgatory, which is a place of Purification, for which action Fire<br/>is more proper then Air; and so the Vehicles of those Souls that<br/>are in Purgatory, cannot be airy, but fiery; and after this rate<br/>there can be but four places for human Souls to be in, viz. Heaven,<br/>Hell, Purgatory,&#160;and this World; but as for Vehicles, they are<br/>but fancies, not real truths. Then the Empress asked them, Where<br/>Heaven and Hell was? Your Saviour Christ, answered the Spirits, has<br/>informed you, that there is Heaven and Hell, but he did not tell<br/>you what, nor where they are; wherefore it is too great a<br/>presumption for you Mortals to inquire after it: If you do but<br/>strive to get into Heaven, it is enough, though you do not know<br/>where or what it is; for it is beyond your knowledg and<br/>understanding. I am satisfied, replied the Empress; and asked<br/>further, Whether there were any Figures or Characters in the Soul?<br/>They answered, Where there was no Body, there could be no Figure.<br/>Then she asked them, Whether Spirits could be naked? and whether<br/>they were of a dark, or a light colour? As for our Nakedness, it is<br/>a very odd question, answered the Spirits; and we do not know what<br/>you mean by a Naked Spirit; for you judg of us as of corporeal<br/>Creatures; and as for Colour, said they, it is according to our<br/>Vehicles; for Colour belongs to Body, and as there is no Body that<br/>is colourless, so there is no Colour that is bodiless. Then the<br/>Empress desired to be informed, Whether all Souls were made at the<br/>first Creation of the World? We know no more, answered the Spirits,<br/>of the origin of humane Souls, then we know of our Selves. she<br/>asked further, Whether humane bodies were not burthensome to humane<br/>Souls? They answered, That Bodies,&#160;made Souls active, as<br/>giving them motion; and if action was troublesome to Souls, then<br/>Bodies were so too. she asked again, Whether Souls did chuse<br/>Bodies? They answered, That Platonicks believed, the Souls of<br/>Lovers lived in the Bodies of their Beloved, but surely, said they,<br/>if there be a multitude of Souls in a World of Matter, they cannot<br/>miss Bodies; for as soon as a Soul is parted from one Body, it<br/>enters into another; and Souls having no motion of themselves, must<br/>of necessity be clothed or imbodied with the next parts of Matter.<br/>If this be so, replied the Empress, then I pray inform me, Whether<br/>all matter be soulified? The Spirits answered, They could not<br/>exactly tell that; but if it was true, that Matter had no other<br/>motion but what came from a spiritual power, and that all matter<br/>was moving, then no soul could quit a Body, but she must, of<br/>necessity enter into another soulified Body, and then there would<br/>be two immaterial substances in one Body. The Empress asked,<br/>Whether it was not possible that there could be two Souls in one<br/>Body? As for Immaterial Souls, answered the Spirits, it is<br/>impossible; for there cannot be two Immaterials in one Inanimate<br/>Body, by reason they want parts, and place, being bodiless; but<br/>there may be numerous material Souls in one composed Body, by<br/>reason every material part has a material natural Soul; for Nature<br/>is but one Infinite self-moving, living and self-knowing body,<br/>consisting of the three degrees&#160;of inanimate, sensitive and<br/>rational Matter, so intermixt together, that no part of Nature,<br/>were it an Atom, can be without any of these three Degrees; the<br/>sensitive is the Life, the rational the Soul, and the inanimate<br/>part, the Body of Infinite Nature. The Empress was very well<br/>satisfied with this answer, and asked further, Whether souls did<br/>not give life to bodies? No, answered they; but Spirits and Divine<br/>Souls have a life of their own, which is not to be divided, being<br/>purer then a natural life; for Spirits are incorporeal, and<br/>consequently indivisible. But when the Soul is in its Vehicle, said<br/>the Empress, then methinks she is like the Sun, and the Vehicle<br/>like the Moon. No, answered they; but the Vehicle is like the Sun,<br/>and the Soul like the Moon; for the Soul hath motion from the Body,<br/>as the Moon has light from the Sun. Then the Empress asked the<br/>Spirits, Whether it was an evil Spirit that tempted Eve, and<br/>brought all the mischiefs upon Mankind: or, Whether it was the<br/>Serpent? They answered, That Spirits could not commit actual evils.<br/>The Empress said, they might do it by perswasions. They answered,<br/>That Perswasions were actions; But the Empress not being contented<br/>with this answer, asked, Whether there was not a supernatural Evil?<br/>The Spirits answered, That there was a Supernatural Good, which was<br/>God; but they knew of no Supernatural Evil, that was equal to God.<br/>Then she desired to know, Whether Evil Spirits&#160;were reckoned<br/>amongst the Beasts of the Field? They answer'd, That many Beasts of<br/>the field were harmless Creatures, and very serviceable for Man's<br/>use; and though some were accounted fierce and cruel, yet did they<br/>exercise their cruelty upon other Creatures, for the most part, to<br/>no other end, but to get themselves food, and to satisfie their<br/>natural appetite; but certainly, said they, you Men are more cruel<br/>to one another, then evil Spirits are to you; and as for their<br/>habitations in desolate places, we having no communion with them,<br/>can give you no certain account thereof. But what do you think,<br/>said the Empress, of good Spirits? may not they be compared to the<br/>Fowls of the Air? They answered, There were many cruel and ravenous<br/>Fowls as well in the Air, as there were fierce and cruel Beasts on<br/>Earth; so that the good are always mixt with the bad. she asked<br/>further, Whether the fiery Vehicles were a Heaven, or a Hell, or at<br/>least a Purgatory to the Souls? They answered, That if the Souls<br/>were immaterial, they could not burn, and then fire would do them<br/>no harm; and though Hell was believed to be an undecaying and<br/>unquenchable fire, yet Heaven was no fire. The Empress replied,<br/>That Heaven was a Light. Yes, said they, but not a fiery Light.<br/>Then she asked, Whether the different shapes and sorts of Vehicles,<br/>made the Souls and other Immaterial Spirits, miserable, or blessed?<br/>The Vehicles, answered they, make them neither better,<br/>nor&#160;worse; for though some Vehicles sometimes may have power<br/>over others, yet these by turns may get some power again over them,<br/>according to the several advantages and disadvantages of particular<br/>Natural parts. The Empress asked further, Whether Animal life came<br/>out of the spiritual World, and did return thither again? The<br/>Spirits answered, They could not exactly tell; but if it were so,<br/>then certainly Animal lives must leave their bodies behind them,<br/>otherwise the bodies would make the spiritual World a mixt World,<br/>that is, partly material, and partly immaterial; but the Truth is,<br/>said they, Spirits being immaterial, cannot properly make a World;<br/>for a World belongs to material, not to immaterial Creatures. If<br/>this be so, replied the Empress, then certainly there can be no<br/>world of Lives and Forms without Matter? No, answered the Spirits;<br/>nor a world of Matter without Lives and Forms; for Natural Lives<br/>and Forms cannot be immaterial, no more then Matter can be<br/>immovable. And therefore natural lives, forms and matter, are<br/>inseparable. Then the Empress asked, Whether the first Man did feed<br/>on the best sorts of the Fruits of the Earth, and the Beasts on the<br/>worst? The Spirits answered, That unless the Beasts of the field<br/>were barred out of manured fields and gardens, they would pick and<br/>chuse the best Fruits as well as Men; and you may plainly observe<br/>it, said they, in Squirrels and Monkies, how they are the best<br/>Chusers of Nuts and Apples; and how&#160;Birds do pick and feed in<br/>the most delicious fruits, and Worms on the best roots, and most<br/>savoury herbs; by which you may see, that those Creatures live and<br/>feed better then men do, except you will say, that artificial<br/>Cookery is better and more wholsome then the natural. Again, the<br/>Empress asked, Whether the first Man gave Names to all the several<br/>sorts of Fishes in the Sea, and fresh Waters? No, answered the<br/>Spirits, for he was an Earthly, and not a Watery Creature; and<br/>therefore could not know the several sorts of Fishes. Why, replied<br/>the Empress, he was no more an Airy Creature then he was a Watery<br/>one, and yet he gave Names to the several sorts of Fowls and Birds<br/>of the Air. Fowls, answered they, are partly Airy, and partly<br/>Earthly Creatures, not onely because they resemble Beasts and Men<br/>in their flesh, but because their rest and dwelling places are on<br/>Earth; for they build their Nests, lay their Eggs, and hatch their<br/>Young, not in the Air, but on the Earth. Then she asked, Whether<br/>the first Man did give Names to all the various sorts of Creatures<br/>that live on the Earth? Yes, answered they, to all those that were<br/>presented to him, or he had knowledg of, that is, to all the prime<br/>sorts; but not to every particular: for of Mankind, said they,<br/>there were but two at first; and as they did encrease, so did their<br/>Names. But, said the Empress, who gave the Names to the several<br/>sorts of Fish? The posterity of Mankind, answered they. Then she<br/>enquired,&#160;Whether there were no more kinds of Creatures now,<br/>then at the first Creation? They answered, That there were no more<br/>nor fewer kinds of Creatures then there are now; but there are,<br/>without question, more particular sorts of Creatures now, then<br/>there were then. she asked again, Whether all those Creatures that<br/>were in Paradise, were also in Noah's Ark? They answered, That the<br/>principal kinds had been there, but not all the particulars. Then<br/>she would fain know, how it came, that both Spirits and Men did<br/>fall from a blessed into so miserable a state and condition as they<br/>are now in. The Spirits answered, By disobedience. The Empress<br/>asked, Whence this disobedient sin did proceed? But the Spirits<br/>desired the Empress not to ask them any such questions, because<br/>they went beyond their knowledg. Then she begg'd the Spirits to<br/>pardon her presumption; for, said she, It is the nature of Mankind<br/>to be inquisitive. Natural desire of knowledg, answered the<br/>Spirits, is not blameable, so you do not go beyond what your<br/>Natural Reason can comprehend. Then I'le ask no more, said the<br/>Empress, for fear I should commit some error; but one thing I<br/>cannot but acquaint you withal: What is that, said the Spirits? I<br/>have a great desire, answered the Empress, to make a Cabbala. What<br/>kind of Cabbala asked the Spirits? The Empress answered, The Jews<br/>Cabbala. No sooner had the Empress declared her Mind, but the<br/>Spirits immediately disappeared&#160;out of her sight; which<br/>startled the Empress so much, that she fell into a Trance, wherein<br/>she lay for some while; at last being come to her self again, she<br/>grew very studious, and considering with her self what might be the<br/>cause of this strange dysaster, conceived at first, that perhaps<br/>the Spirits were tired with hearing and giving answers to her<br/>Questions; but thinking by her self, That Spirits could not be<br/>tired, she imagined that this was not the true cause of their<br/>disappearing, till, after divers debates with her own thoughts, she<br/>did verily believe that the Spirits had committed some fault in<br/>their answers, and that for their punishment they were condemned to<br/>the lowest and darkest Vehicles. This belief was so fixt in her<br/>mind, that it put her into a very Melancholick humor; and then she<br/>sent both for her Fly-men and Worm-men, and declared to them the<br/>cause of her sadness. 'Tis not so much, said she, the vanishing of<br/>those Spirits that makes me Melancholick, but that I should be the<br/>cause of their miserable condition, and that those harmless Spirits<br/>should, for my sake, sink down into the black and dark abyss of the<br/>Earth. The Worm-men comforted the Empress, telling her, That the<br/>Earth was not so horrid a Dwelling, as she did imagine; for, said<br/>they, not onely all Minerals and Vegetables, but several sorts of<br/>Animals can witness, that the Earth is a warm, fruitful, quiet,<br/>safe, and happy habitation; and though they want the light of the<br/>Sun, yet are they not in the dark, but there is light&#160;even<br/>within the Earth, by which those Creatures do see that dwell<br/>therein. This relation setled her Majesties mind a little; but yet<br/>she being desirous to know the Truth, where, and in what condition<br/>those Spirits were, commanded both the Fly- and Worm-men to use all<br/>labour and industry to find them out; whereupon the Worm-men<br/>straight descended into the Earth, and the Fly-men ascended into<br/>the Air. After some short time, the Worm-men returned, and told the<br/>Empress, that when they went into the Earth, they inquired of all<br/>the Creatures they met withal, Whether none of them had perceived<br/>such or such Spirits; until at last coming to the very Center of<br/>the Earth, they were truly informed, that those Spirits had stayed<br/>some time there, but at last were gone to the Antipodes on the<br/>other side of the Terrestrial Globe, diametrically opposite to<br/>theirs. The Fly-men seconded the Wormmen, assuring her Majesty,<br/>that their relation was very true; for, said they, We have rounded<br/>the Earth, and just when we came to the Antipodes, we met those<br/>Spirits in a very good condition, and acquainted them that your<br/>Majesty was very much troubled at their sudden departure, and<br/>fear'd they should be buried in the darkness of the Earth:<br/>whereupon the Spirits answered us, That they were sorry for having<br/>occasioned such sadness and trouble in your Majesty; and desired us<br/>to tell your Majesty, that they feared no darkness; for their<br/>Vehicles were of such a sort of&#160;substance as Cats eyes,<br/>Glow-worms tails, and rotten Wood, carrying their light along with<br/>them; and that they were ready to do your Majesty what service they<br/>could, in making your Cabbala. At which Relation the Empress was<br/>exceedingly glad, and rewarded both her Fly- and Worm-men<br/>bountifully.<br/><br/>After some time, when the Spirits had refreshed themselves in<br/>their own Vehicles, they sent one of their nimblest Spirits, to ask<br/>the Empress, Whether she would have a Scribe, or, whether she would<br/>write the Cabbala her self? The Empress received the proffer which<br/>they made her, with all civility; and told them, that she desired a<br/>Spiritual Scribe. The Spirits answer'd, That they could dictate,<br/>but not write, except they put on a hand or arm, or else the whole<br/>body of Man. The Empress replied, How can Spirits arm themselves<br/>with gantlets of Flesh? As well, answered they, as Man can arm<br/>himself with a gantlet of steel. If it be so, said the Empress,<br/>then I will have a Scribe. Then the Spirits asked her, Whether she<br/>would have the Soul of a living or a dead Man? Why, said the<br/>Empress, can the Soul quit a living Body, and wander or travel<br/>abroad? Yes, answered they, for according to Plato's Doctrine,<br/>there is a Conversation of Souls, and the Souls of Lovers live in<br/>the Bodies of their Beloved. Then I will have, answered she, the<br/>Soul of some ancient famous Writer, either of Aristotle,<br/>Pythagoras, Plato, Epicurus, or the like. The&#160;Spirits said,<br/>That those famous Men were very learned, subtile, and ingenious<br/>Writers; but they were so wedded to their own opinions, that they<br/>would never have the patience to be Scribes. Then, said she, I'le<br/>have the Soul of one of the most famous modern Writers, as either<br/>of Galileo, Gassendus, Des Cartes, Helmont, Hobbes, H. More,<br/>&amp;c. The Spirits answered, That they were fine ingenious<br/>Writers, but yet so self-conceited, that they would scorn to be<br/>Scribes to a Woman. But, said they, there's a Lady, the Duchess of<br/>Newcastle; which although she is not one of the most learned,<br/>eloquent, witty and ingenious, yet she is a plain and rational<br/>Writer; for the principle of her Writings, is Sense and Reason, and<br/>she will without question, be ready to do you all the service she<br/>can. That Lady then, said the Empress, will I chuse for my Scribe,<br/>neither will the Emperor have reason to be jealous, she being one<br/>of my own sex. In truth, said the Spirit, Husbands have reason to<br/>be jealous of Platonick Lovers, for they are very dangerous, as<br/>being not onely intimate and close, but subtil and insinuating. You<br/>say well, replied the Empress; wherefore I pray send me the Duchess<br/>of Newcastle's Soul; which the Spirit did; and after she came to<br/>wait on the Empress, at her first arrival the Empress imbraced and<br/>saluted her with a Spiritual kiss; then she asked her whether she<br/>could write? Yes, answered the Duchess's Soul, but not so<br/>intelligibly that any Reader&#160;whatsoever may understand it,<br/>unless he be taught to know my Characters; for my Letters are<br/>rather like Characters, then well formed Letters. Said the Empress,<br/>you were recommended to me by an honest and ingenious Spirit.<br/>Surely, answered the Duchess, the Spirit is ignorant of my<br/>hand-writing. The truth is, said the Empress, he did not mention<br/>your hand-writing; but he informed me, that you writ Sense and<br/>Reason, and if you can but write so, that any of my Secretaries may<br/>learn your hand, they shall write it out fair and intelligible. The<br/>Duchess answered, That she questioned not but it might easily be<br/>learned in a short time. But, said she to the Empress, What is it<br/>that your Majesty would have written? she answered, The Jews<br/>Cabbala. Then your onely way for that is, said the Duchess, to have<br/>the Soul of some famous Jew; nay, if your Majesty please, I scruple<br/>not, but you may as easily have the Soul of Moses, as of any other.<br/>That cannot be, replied the Empress, for no Mortal knows where<br/>Moses is. But, said the Duchess, humane Souls are immortal;<br/>however, if this be too difficult to be obtained, you may have the<br/>Soul of one of the chief Rabbies or Sages of the Tribe of Levi, who<br/>will truly instruct you in that mystery; when as, otherwise, your<br/>Majesty will be apt to mistake, and a thousand to one, will commit<br/>gross errors. No, said the Empress, for I shall be instructed by<br/>Spirits. Alas! said the Duchess, Spirits are as ignorant as Mortals<br/>in many cases; for&#160;no created Spirits have a general or<br/>absolute knowledg, nor can they know the Thoughts of Men, much less<br/>the Mysteries of the great Creator, unless he be pleased to inspire<br/>into them the gift of Divine Knowledg. Then, I pray, said the<br/>Empress, let me have your counsel in this case. The Duchess<br/>answered, If your Majesty will be pleased to hearken to my advice,<br/>I would desire you to let that work alone; for it will be of no<br/>advantage either to you, or your people, unless you were of the<br/>Jews Religion; nay, if you were, the vulgar interpretation of the<br/>holy Scripture would be more instructive, and more easily believed,<br/>then your mystical way of interpreting it; for had it been better<br/>and more advantagious for the Salvation of the Jews, surely Moses<br/>would have saved after-Ages that labour by his own Explanation, he<br/>being not onely a wise, but a very honest, zealous and religious<br/>Man: Wherefore the best way, said she, is to believe with the<br/>generality the literal sense of the Scripture, and not to make<br/>interpretations every one according to his own fancy, but to leave<br/>that work for the Learned, or those that have nothing else to do;<br/>Neither do I think, said she, that God will damn those that are<br/>ignorant therein, or suffer them to be lost for want of a Mystical<br/>interpretation of the Scripture. Then, said the Empress, I'le leave<br/>the Scripture, and make a Philosophical Cabbala. The Duchess told<br/>her, That, Sense and Reason would instruct her of a Nature as much<br/>as&#160;could be known; and as for Numbers, they were infinite; but<br/>to add non-sense to infinite, would breed a confusion, especially<br/>in Humane Understanding. Then, replied the Empress, I'le make a<br/>Moral Cabbala. The onely thing, answered the Duchess, in Morality,<br/>is but, To fear God, and to love his Neighbour, and this needs no<br/>further interpretation. But then I'le make a Political Cabbala,<br/>said the Empress. The Duchess answered, That the chief and onely<br/>ground in Government, was but Reward and Punishment, and required<br/>no further Cabbala; But, said she, If your Majesty were resolved to<br/>make a Cabbala, I would advise you, rather to make a Poetical or<br/>Romancical Cabbala, wherein you may use Metaphors, Allegories,<br/>Similitudes, &amp;c. and interpret them as you please. With that<br/>the Empress thank'd the Duchess, and embracing her Soul, told her<br/>she would take her Counsel: she made her also her Favourite, and<br/>kept her sometime in that World, and by this means the Duchess came<br/>to know and give this Relation of all that passed in that rich,<br/>populous, and happy World; and after some time the Empress gave her<br/>leave to return to her Husband and Kindred into her Native World,<br/>but upon condition, that her Soul should visit her now and then;<br/>which she did: and truly their meeting did produce such an intimate<br/>friendship between them, that they became Platonick Lovers,<br/>although they were both Femals.<br/><br/>One time, when the Duchess her Soul was with the Empress, she<br/>seem'd to be very sad and melancholy; at which the Empress was very<br/>much troubled, and asked her the reason of her Melancholick humour?<br/>Truly, said the Duchess to the Empress, (for between dear friends<br/>there's no concealment, they being like several parts of one united<br/>body) my Melancholy proceeds from an extream Ambition. The Empress<br/>asked, What the height of her ambition was? The Duchess answered,<br/>That neither she her self, nor no Creature in the World was able to<br/>know either the height, depth, or breadth of her Ambition; but said<br/>she, my present desire is, that I would be a great Princess. The<br/>Empress replied, so you are; for you are a Princess of the fourth<br/>or fifth Degree, for a Duke or Duchess is the highest title or<br/>honour that a subject can arrive to, as being the next to a King's<br/>Title; and as for the name of a Prince of Princess, it belongs to<br/>all that are adopted to the Crown; so that those that can add a<br/>Crown to their Arms, are Princes, and therefore a Duke is a Title<br/>above a Prince; for example, the Duke of Savoy, the Duke of<br/>Florence, the Duke of Lorrain, as also Kings Brothers, are not<br/>called by the name of Princes, but Dukes, this being the higher<br/>Title. 'Tis true, answered the Duchess, unless it be Kings Eldest<br/>sons, and they are created Princes. Yes, replied the Empress, but<br/>no soveraign does make a subject equal to himself, such as Kings<br/>eldest sons partly are:&#160;And although some Dukes be soveraigns,<br/>yet I have heard that a Prince by his Title is soveraign, by reason<br/>the Title of a Prince is more a Title of Honour, then of<br/>soveraignty; for, as I said before, it belongs to all that are<br/>adopted to the Crown. Well, said the Duchess, setting aside this<br/>dispute, my Ambition is, That I would fain be as you are, that is,<br/>an Empress of a World, and I shall never be at quiet until I be<br/>one. I love you so well, replied the Empress, that I wish with all<br/>my soul, you had the fruition of your ambitious desire, and I shall<br/>not fail to give you my best advice how to accomplish it; the best<br/>informers are the Immaterial Spirits, and they'l soon tell you,<br/>Whether it be possible to obtain your wish. But, said the Duchess,<br/>I have little acquaintance with them, for I never knew any before<br/>the time you sent for me. They know you, replied the Empress; for<br/>they told me of you, and were the means and instrument of your<br/>coming hither: Wherefore I'le conferr with them, and enquire<br/>whether there be not another World, whereof you may be Empress as<br/>well as I am of this? No sooner had the Empress said this, but some<br/>Immaterial Spirits came to visit her, of whom she inquired, Whether<br/>there were but three Worlds in all, to wit, the Blazing World where<br/>she was in, the World which she came from, and the World where the<br/>Duchess lived? The Spirits answered, That there were more numerous<br/>Worlds then the Stars which appeared in these three mentioned<br/>Worlds.&#160;Then the Empress asked, Whether it was not possible<br/>that her dearest friend the Duchess of Newcastle, might be Empress<br/>of one of them? Although there be numerous, nay, infinite Worlds,<br/>answered the Spirits, yet none is without Government. But is none<br/>of these Worlds so weak, said she, that it may be surprized or<br/>conquered? The Spirits answered, That Lucian's World of Lights, had<br/>been for some time in a snuff, but of late years one Helmont had<br/>got it, who since he was Emperour of it, had so strengthened the<br/>Immortal parts thereof with mortal out-works, as it was for the<br/>present impregnable. said the Empress, If there be such an Infinite<br/>number of Worlds, I am sure, not onely my friend, the Duchess, but<br/>any other might obtain one. Yes, answered the Spirits, if those<br/>Worlds were uninhabited; but they are as populous as this your<br/>Majesty governs. Why, said the Empress, it is not possible to<br/>conquer a World. No, answered the Spirits, but, for the most part,<br/>Conquerers seldom enjoy their conquest, for they being more feared<br/>then loved, most commonly come to an untimely end. If you will but<br/>direct me, said the Duchess to the Spirits, which World is easiest<br/>to be conquered, her Majesty will assist me with Means, and I will<br/>trust to Fate and Fortune; for I had rather die in the adventure of<br/>noble atchievements, then live in obscure and sluggish security;<br/>since the by one, I may live in a glorious Fame; and by the other I<br/>am buried&#160;in oblivion. The Spirits answered, That the lives of<br/>Fame were like other lives; for some lasted long, and some died<br/>soon. 'Tis true, said the Duchess; but yet the shortest-liv'd Fame<br/>lasts longer then the longest life of Man. But, replied the<br/>Spirits, if occasion does not serve you, you must content your self<br/>to live without such atchievements that may gain you a Fame: But we<br/>wonder, proceeded the Spirits, that you desire to be Empress of a<br/>Terrestrial World, when as you can create your self a Cœlestial<br/>World if you please. What, said the Empress, can any Mortal be a<br/>Creator? Yes, answered the Spirits; for every human Creature can<br/>create an Immaterial World fully inhabited by Immaterial Creatures,<br/>and populous of Immaterial subjects, such as we are, and all this<br/>within the compass of the head or scull; nay, not onely so, but he<br/>may create a World of what fashion and Government he will, and give<br/>the Creatures thereof such motions, figures, forms, colours,<br/>perceptions, &amp;c. as he pleases, and make Whirl-pools, Lights,<br/>Pressures, and Reactions, &amp;c. as he thinks best; nay, he may<br/>make a World full of Veins, Muscles, and Nerves, and all these to<br/>move by one jolt or stroke: also he may alter that World as often<br/>as he pleases, or change it from a Natural World, to an Artificial;<br/>he may make a World of Ideas, a World of Atoms, a World of Lights,<br/>or whatsoever his Fancy leads him to. And since it is in your power<br/>to create such a World, What&#160;need you to venture life,<br/>reputation and tranquility, to conquer a gross material World? For<br/>you can enjoy no more of a material world then a particular<br/>Creature is able to enjoy, which is but a small part, considering<br/>the compass of such a world; and you may plainly observe it by your<br/>friend the Empress here, which although she possesses a whole<br/>World, yet enjoys she but a part thereof; neither is she so much<br/>acquainted with it, that she know all the places, Countries, and<br/>Dominions she Governs. The truth is, a soveraign Monarch has the<br/>general trouble; but the Subjects enjoy all the delights and<br/>pleasures in parts, for it is impossible, that a Kingdom, nay, a<br/>Country, should be injoyed by one person at once, except he take<br/>the pains to travel into every part, and endure the inconveniencies<br/>of going from one place to another? wherefore, since glory,<br/>delight, and pleasure lives but in other mens opinions, and can<br/>neither add tranquility to your mind nor give ease to your body,<br/>Why should you desire to be Empress of a Material World, and be<br/>troubled with the cares that attend Government? when as by creating<br/>a World within your self, you may enjoy all both in whole and in<br/>parts, without controle or opposition; and may make what World you<br/>please, and alter it when you please, and enjoy as much pleasure<br/>and delight as a World can afford you? You have converted me, said<br/>the Duchess to the Spirits, from my ambitious desire; wherefore,<br/>I'le take your advice,&#160;reject and despise all the Worlds<br/>without me, and create a World of my own. The Empress said, If I do<br/>make such a world, then I shall be Mistress of two Worlds, one<br/>within, and the other without me. That your Majesty may, said the<br/>Spirits; and so left these two Ladies to create two Worlds within<br/>themselves: who did also part from each other, until such time as<br/>they had brought their Worlds to perfection. The Duchess of<br/>Newcastle was most earnest and industrious to make her World,<br/>because she had none at present; and first she resolved to frame it<br/>according to the opinion of Thales, but she found her self so much<br/>troubled with Dæmons, that they would not suffer her to take her<br/>own will, but forced her to obey their orders and commands; which<br/>she being unwilling to do, left off from making a world that way,<br/>and began to frame one according to Pythagoras's Doctrine; but in<br/>the Creation thereof, she was so puzled with numbers, how to order<br/>and compose the several parts, that she having no skill in<br/>Arithmetick, was forced also to desist from the making of that<br/>World. Then she intended to create a World according to the opinion<br/>of Plato; but she found more trouble and difficulty in that, then<br/>in the two former; for the numerous Idea's having no other motion<br/>but what was derived from her mind, whence they did flow and issue<br/>out, made it a far harder business to her, to impart motion to<br/>them, then Puppit-players have in giving motion to every several<br/>Puppit; in&#160;so much, that her patience was not able to endure<br/>the trouble which those Ideas caused her; wherefore she annihilated<br/>also that World, and was resolved to make one according to the<br/>Opinion of Epicurus; which she had no sooner begun, but the<br/>infinite Atoms made such a mist, that it quite blinded the<br/>perception of her mind; neither was she able to make a Vacuum as a<br/>receptacle for those Atoms, or a place which they might retire<br/>into; so that partly for the want of it, and of a good order and<br/>method, the confusion of those Atoms produced such strange and<br/>monstrous figures, as did more affright then delight her, and<br/>caused such a Chaos in her mind, as had almost dissolved it. At<br/>last, having with much ado cleansed and cleared her mind of these<br/>dusty and misty particles, she endeavored to create a World<br/>according to Aristotle's Opinion; but remembring that her mind, as<br/>most of the Learned hold it, was Immaterial, and that, according to<br/>Aristotle's Principle, out of Nothing, Nothing could be made; she<br/>was forced also to desist from that work, and then she fully<br/>resolved, not to take any more patterns from the Ancient<br/>Philosophers, but to follow the Opinions of the Moderns; and to<br/>that end, she endeavoured to make a World according to Des Cartes<br/>Opinion; but when she had made the Æthereal Globules, and set them<br/>a moving by a strong and lively imagination, her mind became so<br/>dizzie with their extraordinary swift turning round, that it almost<br/>put her into a swoon;&#160;for her thoughts, but their constant<br/>tottering, did so stagger, as if they had all been drunk: wherefore<br/>she dissolved that World, and began to make another, according to<br/>Hobbs's Opinion; but when all the parts of this Imaginary World<br/>came to press and drive each other, they seemed like a company of<br/>Wolves that worry sheep, or like so many Dogs that hunt after<br/>Hares; and when she found a re-action equal to those pressures, her<br/>mind was so squeezed together, that her thoughts could neither move<br/>forward nor backward, which caused such an horrible pain in her<br/>head, that although she had dissolved that World, yet she could<br/>not, without much difficulty, settle her mind, and free it from<br/>that pain which those pressures and reactions had caused in it.<br/><br/>At last, when the Duchess saw that no patterns would do her any<br/>good in the framing of her World; she was resolved to make a World<br/>of her own Invention, and this World was composed of sensitive and<br/>rational self-moving Matter; indeed, it was composed onely of the<br/>Rational, which is the subtilest and purest degree of Matter; for<br/>as the Sensitive did move and act both to the perceptions and<br/>consistency of the body, so this degree of Matter at the same point<br/>of time (for though the degrees are mixt, yet the several parts may<br/>move several ways at one time) did move to the Creation of the<br/>Imaginary World; which World after it was made, appear'd so curious<br/>and full of variety,&#160;so well order'd and wisely govern'd, that<br/>it cannot possibly be expressed by words, nor the delight and<br/>pleasure which the Duchess took in making this<br/>World-of-her-own.<br/><br/>In the mean time the Empress was also making and dissolving<br/>several Worlds in her own mind, and was so puzled, that she could<br/>not settle in any of them; wherefore she sent for the Duchess, who<br/>being ready to wait on the Empress, carried her beloved World along<br/>with her, and invited the Empress's Soul to observe the Frame,<br/>Order and Government of it. Her Majesty was so ravished with the<br/>perception of it, that her Soul desired to live in the Duchess's<br/>World: But the Duchess advised her to make such another World in<br/>her own mind; for, said she, your Majesty's mind is full of<br/>rational corporeal motions; and the rational motions of my mind<br/>shall assist you by the help of sensitive expressions, with the<br/>best Instructions they are able to give you.<br/><br/>The Empress being thus perswaded by the Duchess to make an<br/>imaginary World of her own, followed her advice; and after she had<br/>quite finished it, and framed all kinds of Creatures proper and<br/>useful for it, strengthened it with good Laws, and beautified it<br/>with Arts and Sciences; having nothing else to do, unless she did<br/>dissolve her Imaginary World, or made some alterations in the<br/>Blazing-World, she lived in; which yet she could hardly do, by<br/>reason it was so well ordered&#160;that it could not be mended; for<br/>it was governed without secret and deceiving Policy; neither was<br/>there any ambitious, factions, malicious detractions, civil<br/>dissentions, or home-bred quarrels, divisions in Religion, Foreign<br/>Wars, &amp;c. but all the people lived in a peaceful society,<br/>united Tranquility, and Religious Conformity. she was desirious to<br/>see the World the Duchess came from, and observe therein the<br/>several sovereign Governments, Laws and Customs of several Nations.<br/>The Duchess used all the means she could, to divert her from that<br/>Journey, telling her, that the World she came from, was very much<br/>disturbed with Factions, Divisions and Wars; but the Empress would<br/>not be perswaded from her design; and lest the Emperor, or any of<br/>his subjects should know of her travel, and obstruct her design;<br/>she sent for some of the Spirits she had formerly conversed withal,<br/>and inquired whether none of them could supply the place of her<br/>soul in her body at such a time, when she was gone to travel into<br/>another World? They answered, Yes, they could; for not onely one,<br/>said they, but many Spirits may enter into your body, if you<br/>please. The Empress replied, she desired but one Spirit to be Vice-<br/>Roy of her body in the absence of her Soul, but it must be an<br/>honest and ingenious Spirit; and if it was possible, a female<br/>Spirit. The Spirits told her, that there was no difference of Sexes<br/>amongst them; but, said they, we will chuse an honest and ingenious<br/>Spirit,&#160;and such a one as shall so resemble your soul, that<br/>neither the Emperor, nor any of his Subjects, although the most<br/>Divine, shall know whether it be your own soul, or not: which the<br/>Empress was very glad at, and after the Spirits were gone, asked<br/>the Duchess, how her body was supplied in the absence of her soul?<br/>who answered Her Majesty, That her body, in the absence of her<br/>soul, was governed by her sensitive and rational corporeal motions.<br/>Thus those two Female Souls travelled together as lightly as two<br/>thoughts into the Duchess her native World; and, which is<br/>remarkable, in a moment viewed all the parts of it, and all the<br/>actions of all the Creatures therein, especially did the Empress's<br/>Soul take much notice of the several actions of humane Creatures in<br/>all the several Nations and parts of that World, and wonder'd that<br/>for all there were so many several Nations, Governments, Laws,<br/>Religions, Opinions, &amp;c. they should all yet so generally agree<br/>in being Ambitious, Proud, Self-conceited, Vain, Prodigal,<br/>Deceitful, Envious, Malicious, Unjust, Revengeful, Irreligious,<br/>Factious, &amp;c. she did also admire, that not any particular<br/>State, Kingdom or Common-wealth, was contented with their own<br/>shares, but endeavoured to encroach upon their Neighbours, and that<br/>their greatest glory was in Plunder and Slaughter, and yet their<br/>victory's less then their expences, and their losses more than<br/>their gains; but their being overcome, in a manner their utter<br/>ruine:&#160;But that she wonder'd most at, was, that they should<br/>prize or value dirt more then mens lives, and vanity more then<br/>tranquility: for the Emperor of a world, said she, injoys but a<br/>part, not the whole; so that his pleasure consists in the Opinions<br/>of others. It is strange to me, answered the Duchess, that you<br/>should say thus, being your self, an Empress of a World; and not<br/>onely of a world, but of a peaceable, quiet, and obedient world.<br/>'Tis true, replied the Empress: but although it is a peaceable and<br/>obedient world, yet the Government thereof is rather a trouble,<br/>then a pleasure; for order cannot be without industry, contrivance,<br/>and direction: besides, the Magnificent state, that great Princes<br/>keep or ought to keep, is troublesome. Then by your Majestie's<br/>discourse, said the Duchess, I perceive that the greatest happiness<br/>in all the Worlds consist in Moderation: No doubt of it, replied<br/>the Empress; and after these two souls had visited all the several<br/>places, Congregations and Assemblies both in Religion and State,<br/>the several Courts of Judicature and the like, in several Nations,<br/>the Empress said, That of all the Monarchs of the several parts of<br/>the World, she had observed the Grand-Seignior was the greatest;<br/>for his word was a Law, and his power absolute. But the Duchess<br/>pray'd the Empress to pardon her that she was of another mind; for,<br/>said she, he cannot alter Mahomets Laws and Religion; so that the<br/>Law and Church do govern the Emperor, and not the<br/>Emperor&#160;them. But, replied the Empress, he has power in some<br/>particulars; as for example, To place and displace Subjects in<br/>their particular Governments of Church and State; and having that,<br/>he has the Command both over Church and State, and none dares<br/>oppose him. 'Tis true, said the Duchess; but if it pleases your<br/>Majesty, we will go into that part of the World whence I came to<br/>wait on your Majesty, and there you shall see as powerful a Monarch<br/>as the Grand Signior; for though his Dominions are not of so large<br/>extent, yet they are much stronger, his Laws are easie and safe,<br/>and he governs so justly and wisely, that his Subjects are the<br/>happiest people of all the Nations or parts of that World. This<br/>Monarch, said the Empress, I have a great mind to see. Then they<br/>both went, and in a short time arrived into his Dominions; but<br/>coming into the Metropolitan City, the Empress's Soul observed many<br/>Gallants go into an House; and enquiring of the Duchess's Soul,<br/>what House that was? she told her, It was one of the Theatres where<br/>Comedies and Tragedies were acted. The Empress asked, Whether they<br/>were real? No, said the Duchess, they are feigned. Then the Empress<br/>desired to enter into the Theatre; and when she had seen the Play<br/>that was asked, the Duchess asked her how she liked that<br/>Recreation? I like it very well, said the Empress; but I observe<br/>that the Actors make a better show than the Spectators; and the<br/>Scenes a better than&#160;the Actors and the Musick and Dancing is<br/>more pleasant and acceptable than the Play it self; for I see, the<br/>Scenes stand for Wit, the Dancing for Humour, and the Musick is the<br/>Chorus. I am sorry, replied the Duchess, to hear your Majesty say<br/>so; for if the Wits of this part of the World should hear you, they<br/>would condemn you. What, said the Empress, would they condemn me<br/>for preferring a natural Face before a Sign-post; or a natural<br/>Humour before an artificial Dance; or Musick before a true and<br/>profitable Relation? As for Relation, replied the Duchess, our<br/>Poets defie and condemn it into a Chimney-corner, fitter for old<br/>Womens Tales, than Theatres. Why, said the Empress do not your<br/>Poets Actions comply with their Judgments? For their Plays are<br/>composed of old Stories, either of Greek or Roman, or some<br/>new-found World. The Duchess answered Her Majesty, That it was<br/>true, that all or most of their Plays were taken out of old<br/>Stories; but yet they had new Actions, which being joined to old<br/>Stories, together with the addition of new Prologues, Scenes,<br/>Musick and Dancing, made new Plays.<br/><br/>After this, both the Souls went to the Court, where all the<br/>Royal Family was together, attended by the chief of the Nobles of<br/>their Dominions, which made a very magnificent Show; and when the<br/>Soul of the Empress viewed the King and Queen, she seemed to be in<br/>a maze, which the Duchess's Soul perceiving, asked&#160;the Empress<br/>how she liked the King, the Queen, and all the Royal Race? she<br/>answered, that in all the Monarchs she had seen in that World, she<br/>had not found so much Majesty and Affability mixt so exactly<br/>together, that none did overshadow or eclipse the other; and as for<br/>the Queen, she said that Vertue sat Triumphant in her face, and<br/>Piety was dwelling in her heart; and that all the Royal Family<br/>seem'd to be endued with a Divine splendor: but when she had heard<br/>the King discourse, she believ'd that Mercury and Apollo had been<br/>his Cœlestial Instructors; and, my dear Lord and Husband, added the<br/>Duchess, has been his Earthly Governor. But after some short stay<br/>in the Court, the Duchess's soul grew very Melancholy; the Empress<br/>asking the cause of her sadness? she told her, That she had an<br/>extreme desire to converse with the soul of her Noble Lord and dear<br/>Husband, and that she was inpatient of a longer stay. The Empress<br/>desired the Duchess to have but patience so long, until the King,<br/>the Queen, and the Royal Family were retired, and then she would<br/>bear her Company to her Lord and Husband's Soul, who at that time<br/>lived in the Country some 112 miles off; which she did: and thus<br/>these two souls went towards those parts of the Kingdom where the<br/>Duke of Newcastle was.<br/><br/>But one thing I forgot all this while, which is, That although<br/>thoughts are the natural language of Souls; yet by reason Souls<br/>cannot travel without Vehicles,&#160;they use such language as the<br/>nature and propriety of their Vehicles require, and the Vehicles of<br/>those two souls being made of the purest and finest sort of air,<br/>and of a human shape: This purity and fineness was the cause that<br/>they could neither be seen nor heard by any human Creature; when<br/>as, had they been of some grosser sort of Air, the sound of the<br/>Air's language would have been as perceptible as the blowing of<br/>Zephyrus.<br/><br/>And now to return to my former Story; when the Empress's and<br/>Duchess's Soul were travelling into Nottinghamshire, (for that was<br/>the place where the Duke did reside) passing through the Forrest of<br/>sherewood, the Empress's Soul was very much delighted with it, as<br/>being a dry, plain and woody place, very pleasant to travel in,<br/>both in Winter and Summer; for it is neither much dirty nor dusty<br/>at no time: At last they arrived at Welbeck, a House where the Duke<br/>dwell'd, surrounded all with Wood, so close and full, that the<br/>Empress took great pleasure and delight therein, and told the<br/>Duchess she never had observed more Wood in so little compass in<br/>any part of the Kingdom she had passed through. The truth is, said<br/>she, there seems to be more Wood on the Seas (she meaning the<br/>Ships) than on the Land. The Duchess told her, The reason was, that<br/>there had been a long Civil Warr in that Kingdom, in which most of<br/>the best Timber-trees and Principal Palaces were ruined and<br/>destroyed; and&#160;my dear Lord and Husband, said she, has lost by<br/>it half his Woods, besides many Houses, Land, and movable Goods; so<br/>that all the loss out of his particular Estate, did amount to above<br/>Half a Million of Pounds. I wish, said the Empress, he had some of<br/>the Gold that is in the Blazing-world, to repair his losses. The<br/>Duchess most humbly thank'd her Imperial Majesty for her kind<br/>wishes; but, said she, Wishes will not repair his ruins: however,<br/>God has given my Noble Lord and Husband great Patience, by which he<br/>bears all his losses and misfortunes. As last they enter'd into the<br/>Duke's House, an Habitation not so magnificent as useful; and when<br/>the Empress saw it, Has the Duke, said she, no other House but<br/>this? Yes, answered the Duchess, some five miles from this place he<br/>has a very fine Castle called Bolesover. That place, then, said the<br/>Empress, I desire to see. Alas, replied the Duchess, it is but a<br/>naked House, and uncloath'd of all Furniture. However, said the<br/>Empress, I may see the manner of its structure and building. That<br/>you may, replied the Duchess, and as they were thus discoursing,<br/>the Duke came out of the House into the Court, to see his Horses of<br/>Manage; whom when the Duchess's Soul perceived, she was so<br/>overjoyed, that her Aereal Vehicle became so splendorous, as if it<br/>had been enlightned by the Sun; by which we may perceive, that the<br/>passions of Souls or Spirits can alter their bodily Vehicles. Then<br/>these two Ladies Spirits went close to him, but he&#160;could not<br/>perceive them; and after the Empress had observed that Art of<br/>Mannage, she was much pleased with it, and commended it as a noble<br/>pastime, and an exercise fit and proper for noble and heroick<br/>Persons. But when the Duke was gone into the house again, those two<br/>Souls followed him; where the Empress observing, that he went to<br/>the exercise of the sword, and was such an excellent and<br/>unparallel'd Master thereof, she was as much pleased with that<br/>exercise, as she was with the former: But the Duchess's Soul being<br/>troubled, that her dear Lord and Husband used such a violent<br/>exercise before meat, for fear of overheating himself, without any<br/>consideration of the Empress's Soul, left her Æreal Vehicle, and<br/>entred into her Lord. The Empress's Soul perceiving this, did the<br/>like: And then the Duke had three Souls in one Body; and had there<br/>been some such Souls more, the Duke would have been like the<br/>Grand-Signior in his Seraglio, onely it would have been a Platonick<br/>Seraglio. But the Duke's Soul being wise, honest, witty,<br/>complaisant and noble, afforded such delight and pleasure to the<br/>Empress's Soul by his conversation, that these two souls became<br/>enamoured of each other; which the Duchess's soul perceiving, grew<br/>jealous at first, but then considering that no Adultery could be<br/>committed amongst Platonick Lovers, and that Platonism, was Divine,<br/>as being derived from Divine Plato, cast forth of her mind that<br/>Idea of Jealousie. Then the Conversation&#160;of these three souls<br/>was so pleasant, that it cannot be expressed; for the Duke's Soul<br/>entertained the Empress's Soul with Scenes, songs, Musick, witty<br/>Discourses, pleasant Recreations, and all kinds of harmless sports,<br/>so that the time passed away faster than they expected. At last a<br/>Spirit came and told the Empress, That although neither the Emperor<br/>nor any of his Subjects knew that her Soul was absent; yet the<br/>Emperor's Soul was so sad and melancholy for want of His own<br/>beloved Soul, that all the Imperial Court took notice of it.<br/>Wherefore he advised the Empress's Soul to return into the<br/>Blazing-world, into her own Body she left there; which both the<br/>Duke's and Duchess's Soul was very sorry for, and wished that, if<br/>it had been possible, the Empress's Soul might have stayed a longer<br/>time with them; but seeing it could not be otherwise, they pacified<br/>themselves. But before the Empress returned into the Blazing-world,<br/>the Duchess desired a Favour of her, to wit, That she would be<br/>pleased to make an Agreement between her Noble Lord, and Fortune.<br/>Why, said the Empress, are they Enemies? Yes, answered the Duchess,<br/>and they have been so ever since I have been his Wife: nay, I have<br/>heard my Lord say, That she hath crossed him in all things, ever<br/>since he could remember. I am sorry for that, replied the Empress;<br/>but I cannot discourse with Fortune, without the help of an<br/>Immaterial Spirit, and that cannot be done in this World; for I<br/>have no&#160;Fly nor Bird-men here, to send into the Region of the<br/>Air, where, for the most part, their Habitations are. The Duchess<br/>said, she would entreat her Lord to send an Attorney or Lawyer to<br/>plead his Cause. Fortune will bribe them, replied the Empress, and<br/>so the Duke may chance to be cast: Wherefore the best way will be,<br/>for the Duke to chuse a Friend on his side, and let Fortune chuse<br/>another, and try whether by this means it be possible to compose<br/>the Difference. The Duchess said, They will never come to an<br/>agreement, unless there be a Judg or Umpire to decide the Case. A<br/>Judg, replied the Empress, is easie to be had; but to get an<br/>Impartial Judg, is a thing so difficult, that I doubt we shall<br/>hardly find one; for there is none to be had, neither in Nature,<br/>nor in Hell, but onely from Heaven; and how to get such a Divine<br/>and Celestial Judg, I cannot tell: Nevertheless, if you will go<br/>along with me into the Blazing-world, I'le try what may be done.<br/>'Tis my duty, said the Duchess, to wait on your Majesty, and I<br/>shall most willingly do it, for I have no other interest to<br/>consider. Then the Duchess spake to the Duke concerning the<br/>difference between him and Fortune, and how it was her desire that<br/>they might be friends. The Duke answered, That for his part he had<br/>always with great industry sought her friendship, but as yet he<br/>could never obtain it, for she had always been his Enemy. However,<br/>said he, I'le try and send my two Friends, Prudence<br/>and&#160;Honesty, to plead my Cause. Then these two Friends went<br/>with the Duchess and the Empress into the Blazing-World; (for it is<br/>to be observed, that they are somewhat like Spirits, because they<br/>are Immaterial, although their actions are corporeal:) and after<br/>their arrival there, when the Empress had refreshed her self, and<br/>rejoiced with the Emperor, she sent her Fly-men for some of the<br/>Spirits, and desired their assistance, to compose the difference<br/>between Fortune, and the Duke of Newcastle. But they told her<br/>Majesty, That Fortune was so inconstant, that although she would<br/>perhaps promise to hear their Cause pleaded, yet it was a thousand<br/>to one, whether she would ever have the patience to do it:<br/>Nevertheless, upon Her Majestie's request, they tried their utmost,<br/>and at last prevailed with Fortune so far, that she chose Folly and<br/>Rashness, for her Friends, but they could not agree in chusing a<br/>Judg; until at last, with much ado, they concluded, that Truth<br/>should hear, and decide the cause.

His<br/>Friends Honesty and Prudence, said he most scornfully, are more to<br/>be regarded, than Inconstant Fortune, who is onely a friend to<br/>Fools and Knaves; for which neglect and scorn, whether I have not<br/>just reason to be his enemy, your Majesty may judg your self.<br/><br/>After Fortune had thus ended her Speech, the Duchess's Soul rose<br/>from her seat, and spake to the Immaterial Assembly in this<br/>manner:<br/>
