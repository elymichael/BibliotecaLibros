<br/><br/><br/>To The Duchesse of Newcastle, On Her New<br/>Blazing-World.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Our Elder World, with all their Skill and Arts,<br/><br/>Could but divide the World into three Parts:<br/><br/>Columbus, then for Navigation fam'd,<br/><br/>Found a new World, America 'tis nam'd;<br/><br/>Now this new World was found, it was not made,<br/><br/>Onely discovered, lying in Time's shade.<br/><br/>Then what are You, having no Chaos found<br/><br/>To make a World, or any such least ground?<br/>
