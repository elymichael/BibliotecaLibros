<br/>"There is but one thing to do. It must be done at once. You must<br/>put this piece of paper which you have shown us into the brass box<br/>which you have described. You must also put in a note to say that<br/>all the other papers were burned by your uncle, and that this is<br/>the only one which remains. You must assert that in such words as<br/>will carry conviction with them. Having done this, you must at once<br/>put the box out upon the sundial, as directed. Do you<br/>understand?"<br/><br/>"Entirely."<br/><br/>"Do not think of revenge, or anything of the sort, at present. I<br/>think that we may gain that by means of the law; but we have our<br/>web to weave, while theirs is already woven. The first<br/>consideration is to remove the pressing danger which threatens you.<br/>The second is to clear up the mystery and to punish the guilty<br/>parties."<br/><br/>"I thank you," said the young man, rising and pulling on his<br/>overcoat. "You have given me fresh life and hope. I shall certainly<br/>do as you advise."<br/><br/>"Do not lose an instant. And, above all, take care of yourself<br/>in the meanwhile, for I do not think that there can be a doubt that<br/>you are threatened by a very real and imminent danger. How do you<br/>go back?"<br/><br/>"By train from Waterloo."<br/><br/>"It is not yet nine. The streets will be crowded, so I trust<br/>that you may be in safety. And yet you cannot guard yourself too<br/>closely."<br/><br/>"I am armed."<br/><br/>"That is well. To-morrow I shall set to work upon your<br/>case."<br/><br/>"I shall see you at Horsham, then?"<br/><br/>
