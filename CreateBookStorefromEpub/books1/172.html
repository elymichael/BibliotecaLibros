<br/>Dr. Grimesby Roylott's chamber was larger than that of his<br/>step-daughter, but was as plainly furnished. A camp-bed, a small<br/>wooden shelf full of books, mostly of a technical character, an<br/>armchair beside the bed, a plain wooden chair against the wall, a<br/>round table, and a large iron safe were the principal things which<br/>met the eye. Holmes walked slowly round and examined each and all<br/>of them with the keenest interest.<br/><br/>"What's in here?" he asked, tapping the safe.<br/><br/>"My stepfather's business papers."<br/><br/>"Oh! you have seen inside, then?"<br/><br/>"Only once, some years ago. I remember that it was full of<br/>papers."<br/><br/>"There isn't a cat in it, for example?"<br/><br/>"No. What a strange idea!"<br/><br/>"Well, look at this!" He took up a small saucer of milk which<br/>stood on the top of it.<br/><br/>"No; we don't keep a cat. But there is a cheetah and a<br/>baboon."<br/><br/>"Ah, yes, of course! Well, a cheetah is just a big cat, and yet<br/>a saucer of milk does not go very far in satisfying its wants, I<br/>daresay. There is one point which I should wish to determine." He<br/>squatted down in front of the wooden chair and examined the seat of<br/>it with the greatest attention.<br/><br/>
