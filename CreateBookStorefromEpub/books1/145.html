"Well, I got the two dozen from a salesman in Covent<br/>Garden."<br/><br/>"Indeed? I know some of them. Which was it?"<br/><br/>"Breckinridge is his name."<br/><br/>"Ah! I don't know him. Well, here's your good health landlord,<br/>and prosperity to your house. Good-night."<br/><br/>"Now for Mr. Breckinridge," he continued, buttoning up his coat<br/>as we came out into the frosty air. "Remember, Watson that though<br/>we have so homely a thing as a goose at one end of this chain, we<br/>have at the other a man who will certainly get seven years' penal<br/>servitude unless we can establish his innocence. It is possible<br/>that our inquiry may but confirm his guilt; but, in any case, we<br/>have a line of investigation which has been missed by the police,<br/>and which a singular chance has placed in our hands. Let us follow<br/>it out to the bitter end. Faces to the south, then, and quick<br/>march!"<br/><br/>We passed across Holborn, down Endell Street, and so through a<br/>zigzag of slums to Covent Garden Market. One of the largest stalls<br/>bore the name of Breckinridge upon it, and the proprietor a<br/>horsey-looking man, with a sharp face and trim side-whiskers was<br/>helping a boy to put up the shutters.<br/><br/>"Good-evening. It's a cold night," said Holmes.<br/><br/>The salesman nodded and shot a questioning glance at my<br/>companion.<br/><br/>"Sold out of geese, I see," continued Holmes, pointing at the<br/>bare slabs of marble.<br/><br/>"Let you have five hundred to-morrow morning."<br/><br/>"That's no good."<br/>
