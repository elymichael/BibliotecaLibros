"We're hunting in couples again, Doctor, you see," said Jones in<br/>his consequential way. "Our friend here is a wonderful man for<br/>starting a chase. All he wants is an old dog to help him to do the<br/>running down."<br/><br/>"I hope a wild goose may not prove to be the end of our chase,"<br/>observed Mr. Merryweather gloomily.<br/><br/>"You may place considerable confidence in Mr. Holmes, sir," said<br/>the police agent loftily. "He has his own little methods, which<br/>are, if he won't mind my saying so, just a little too theoretical<br/>and fantastic, but he has the makings of a detective in him. It is<br/>not too much to say that once or twice, as in that business of the<br/>Sholto murder and the Agra treasure, he has been more nearly<br/>correct than the official force."<br/><br/>"Oh, if you say so, Mr. Jones, it is all right," said the<br/>stranger with deference. "Still, I confess that I miss my rubber.<br/>It is the first Saturday night for seven-and-twenty years that I<br/>have not had my rubber."<br/><br/>"I think you will find," said Sherlock Holmes, "that you will<br/>play for a higher stake to-night than you have ever done yet, and<br/>that the play will be more exciting. For you, Mr. Merryweather, the<br/>stake will be some 30,000 pounds; and for you, Jones, it will be<br/>the man upon whom you wish to lay your hands."<br/><br/>"John Clay, the murderer, thief, smasher, and forger. He's a<br/>young man, Mr. Merryweather, but he is at the head of his<br/>profession, and I would rather have my bracelets on him than on any<br/>criminal in London. He's a remarkable man, is young John Clay. His<br/>grandfather was a royal duke, and he himself has been to Eton and<br/>Oxford. His brain is as cunning as his fingers, and though we meet<br/>signs of him at every turn, we never know where to find the man<br/>himself. He'll crack a crib in Scotland one week, and be raising<br/>money to build an orphanage in Cornwall the next. I've been on his<br/>track for years and have never set eyes on him yet."<br/><br/>"I hope that I may have the pleasure of introducing you<br/>to-night. I've had one or two little turns also with Mr. John Clay,<br/>and I agree with you that he is at the head of his profession. It<br/>is past ten, however, and quite time that we started. If you two<br/>will take the first hansom, Watson and I will follow in the<br/>second."<br/><br/>Sherlock Holmes was not very communicative during the long drive<br/>and lay back in the cab humming the tunes which he had heard in the<br/>afternoon. We rattled through an endless labyrinth of gas-lit<br/>streets until we emerged into Farrington Street.<br/><br/>"We are close there now," my friend remarked. "This fellow<br/>Merryweather is a bank director, and personally interested in the<br/>matter. I thought it as well to have Jones with us also. He is not<br/>a bad fellow, though an absolute imbecile in his profession. He has<br/>one positive virtue. He is as brave as a bulldog and as tenacious<br/>as a lobster if he gets his claws upon anyone. Here we are, and<br/>they are waiting for us."<br/><br/>We had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in which we had<br/>found ourselves in the morning. Our cabs were dismissed, and,<br/>following the guidance of Mr. Merryweather, we passed down a narrow<br/>passage and through a side door, which he opened for us. Within<br/>there was a small corridor, which ended in a very massive iron<br/>gate. This also was opened, and led down a flight of winding stone<br/>steps, which terminated at another formidable gate. Mr.<br/>Merryweather stopped to light a lantern, and then conducted us down<br/>a dark, earth-smelling passage, and so, after opening a third door,<br/>into a huge vault or cellar, which was piled all round with crates<br/>and massive boxes.<br/><br/>"You are not very vulnerable from above," Holmes remarked as he<br/>held up the lantern and gazed about him.<br/>
