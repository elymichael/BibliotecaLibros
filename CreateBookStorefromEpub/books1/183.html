<br/><br/><br/>Of all the problems which have been submitted to my friend, Mr.<br/>Sherlock Holmes, for solution during the years of our intimacy,<br/>there were only two which I was the means of introducing to his<br/>noticeâ€”that of Mr. Hatherley's thumb, and that of Colonel<br/>Warburton's madness. Of these the latter may have afforded a finer<br/>field for an acute and original observer, but the other was so<br/>strange in its inception and so dramatic in its details that it may<br/>be the more worthy of being placed upon record, even if it gave my<br/>friend fewer openings for those deductive methods of reasoning by<br/>which he achieved such remarkable results. The story has, I<br/>believe, been told more than once in the newspapers, but, like all<br/>such narratives, its effect is much less striking when set forth en<br/>bloc in a single half-column of print than when the facts slowly<br/>evolve before your own eyes, and the mystery clears gradually away<br/>as each new discovery furnishes a step which leads on to the<br/>complete truth. At the time the circumstances made a deep<br/>impression upon me, and the lapse of two years has hardly served to<br/>weaken the effect.<br/><br/>It was in the summer of '89, not long after my marriage, that<br/>the events occurred which I am now about to summarise. I had<br/>returned to civil practice and had finally abandoned Holmes in his<br/>Baker Street rooms, although I continually visited him and<br/>occasionally even persuaded him to forgo his Bohemian habits so far<br/>as to come and visit us. My practice had steadily increased, and as<br/>I happened to live at no very great distance from Paddington<br/>Station, I got a few patients from among the officials. One of<br/>these, whom I had cured of a painful and lingering disease, was<br/>never weary of advertising my virtues and of endeavouring to send<br/>me on every sufferer over whom he might have any influence.<br/><br/>One morning, at a little before seven o'clock, I was awakened by<br/>the maid tapping at the door to announce that two men had come from<br/>Paddington and were waiting in the consulting-room. I dressed<br/>hurriedly, for I knew by experience that railway cases were seldom<br/>trivial, and hastened downstairs. As I descended, my old ally, the<br/>guard, came out of the room and closed the door tightly behind<br/>him.<br/><br/>"I've got him here," he whispered, jerking his thumb over his<br/>shoulder; "he's all right."<br/><br/>"What is it, then?" I asked, for his manner suggested that it<br/>was some strange creature which he had caged up in my room.<br/><br/>"It's a new patient," he whispered. "I thought I'd bring him<br/>round myself; then he couldn't slip away. There he is, all safe and<br/>sound. I must go now, Doctor; I have my dooties, just the same as<br/>you." And off he went, this trusty tout, without even giving me<br/>time to thank him.<br/><br/>I entered my consulting-room and found a gentleman seated by the<br/>table. He was quietly dressed in a suit of heather tweed with a<br/>soft cloth cap which he had laid down upon my books. Round one of<br/>his hands he had a handkerchief wrapped, which was mottled all over<br/>with bloodstains. He was young, not more than five-and-twenty, I<br/>should say, with a strong, masculine face; but he was exceedingly<br/>pale and gave me the impression of a man who was suffering from<br/>some strong agitation, which it took all his strength of mind to<br/>control.<br/><br/>"I am sorry to knock you up so early, Doctor," said he, "but I<br/>have had a very serious accident during the night. I came in by<br/>train this morning, and on inquiring at Paddington as to where I<br/>might find a doctor, a worthy fellow very kindly escorted me here.<br/>I gave the maid a card, but I see that she has left it upon the<br/>side-table."<br/><br/>I took it up and glanced at it. "Mr. Victor Hatherley, hydraulic<br/>engineer, 16A, Victoria Street (3rd floor)." That was the name,<br/>style, and abode of my morning visitor. "I regret that I have kept<br/>you waiting," said I, sitting down in my library-chair. "You are<br/>fresh from a night journey, I understand, which is in itself a<br/>monotonous occupation."<br/><br/>"Oh, my night could not be called monotonous," said he, and<br/>laughed. He laughed very heartily, with a high, ringing note,<br/>leaning back in his chair and shaking his sides. All my medical<br/>instincts rose up against that laugh.<br/>
