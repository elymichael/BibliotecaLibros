"And now as to the villains who seemed to be immediately<br/>implicated in the matter. The Lascar was known to be a man of the<br/>vilest antecedents, but as, by Mrs. St. Clair's story, he was known<br/>to have been at the foot of the stair within a very few seconds of<br/>her husband's appearance at the window, he could hardly have been<br/>more than an accessory to the crime. His defence was one of<br/>absolute ignorance, and he protested that he had no knowledge as to<br/>the doings of Hugh Boone, his lodger, and that he could not account<br/>in any way for the presence of the missing gentleman's clothes.<br/><br/>"So much for the Lascar manager. Now for the sinister cripple<br/>who lives upon the second floor of the opium den, and who was<br/>certainly the last human being whose eyes rested upon Neville St.<br/>Clair. His name is Hugh Boone, and his hideous face is one which is<br/>familiar to every man who goes much to the City. He is a<br/>professional beggar, though in order to avoid the police<br/>regulations he pretends to a small trade in wax vestas. Some little<br/>distance down Threadneedle Street, upon the left-hand side, there<br/>is, as you may have remarked, a small angle in the wall. Here it is<br/>that this creature takes his daily seat, cross-legged with his tiny<br/>stock of matches on his lap, and as he is a piteous spectacle a<br/>small rain of charity descends into the greasy leather cap which<br/>lies upon the pavement beside him. I have watched the fellow more<br/>than once before ever I thought of making his professional<br/>acquaintance, and I have been surprised at the harvest which he has<br/>reaped in a short time. His appearance, you see, is so remarkable<br/>that no one can pass him without observing him. A shock of orange<br/>hair, a pale face disfigured by a horrible scar, which, by its<br/>contraction, has turned up the outer edge of his upper lip, a<br/>bulldog chin, and a pair of very penetrating dark eyes, which<br/>present a singular contrast to the colour of his hair, all mark him<br/>out from amid the common crowd of mendicants and so, too, does his<br/>wit, for he is ever ready with a reply to any piece of chaff which<br/>may be thrown at him by the passers-by. This is the man whom we now<br/>learn to have been the lodger at the opium den, and to have been<br/>the last man to see the gentleman of whom we are in quest."<br/><br/>"But a cripple!" said I. "What could he have done single-handed<br/>against a man in the prime of life?"<br/><br/>"He is a cripple in the sense that he walks with a limp; but in<br/>other respects he appears to be a powerful and well-nurtured man.<br/>Surely your medical experience would tell you, Watson, that<br/>weakness in one limb is often compensated for by exceptional<br/>strength in the others."<br/><br/>"Pray continue your narrative."<br/><br/>"Mrs. St. Clair had fainted at the sight of the blood upon the<br/>window, and she was escorted home in a cab by the police, as her<br/>presence could be of no help to them in their investigations.<br/>Inspector Barton, who had charge of the case, made a very careful<br/>examination of the premises, but without finding anything which<br/>threw any light upon the matter. One mistake had been made in not<br/>arresting Boone instantly, as he was allowed some few minutes<br/>during which he might have communicated with his friend the Lascar,<br/>but this fault was soon remedied, and he was seized and searched,<br/>without anything being found which could incriminate him. There<br/>were, it is true, some blood-stains upon his right shirt-sleeve,<br/>but he pointed to his ring-finger, which had been cut near the<br/>nail, and explained that the bleeding came from there, adding that<br/>he had been to the window not long before, and that the stains<br/>which had been observed there came doubtless from the same source.<br/>He denied strenuously having ever seen Mr. Neville St. Clair and<br/>swore that the presence of the clothes in his room was as much a<br/>mystery to him as to the police. As to Mrs. St. Clair's assertion<br/>that she had actually seen her husband at the window, he declared<br/>that she must have been either mad or dreaming. He was removed,<br/>loudly protesting, to the police-station, while the inspector<br/>remained upon the premises in the hope that the ebbing tide might<br/>afford some fresh clue.<br/><br/>"And it did, though they hardly found upon the mud-bank what<br/>they had feared to find. It was Neville St. Clair's coat, and not<br/>Neville St. Clair, which lay uncovered as the tide receded. And<br/>what do you think they found in the pockets?"<br/><br/>"I cannot imagine."<br/><br/>"No, I don't think you would guess. Every pocket stuffed with<br/>pennies and half-penniesâ€”421 pennies and 270 half-pennies. It was<br/>no wonder that it had not been swept away by the tide. But a human<br/>body is a different matter. There is a fierce eddy between the<br/>wharf and the house. It seemed likely enough that the weighted coat<br/>had remained when the stripped body had been sucked away into the<br/>river."<br/><br/>"But I understand that all the other clothes were found in the<br/>room. Would the body be dressed in a coat alone?"<br/><br/>"No, sir, but the facts might be met speciously enough. Suppose<br/>that this man Boone had thrust Neville St. Clair through the<br/>window, there is no human eye which could have seen the deed. What<br/>would he do then? It would of course instantly strike him that he<br/>must get rid of the tell-tale garments. He would seize the coat,<br/>then, and be in the act of throwing it out, when it would occur to<br/>him that it would swim and not sink. He has little time, for he has<br/>heard the scuffle downstairs when the wife tried to force her way<br/>up, and perhaps he has already heard from his Lascar confederate<br/>that the police are hurrying up the street. There is not an instant<br/>to be lost. He rushes to some secret hoard, where he has<br/>accumulated the fruits of his beggary, and he stuffs all the coins<br/>upon which he can lay his hands into the pockets to make sure of<br/>the coat's sinking. He throws it out, and would have done the same<br/>with the other garments had not he heard the rush of steps below,<br/>and only just had time to close the window when the police<br/>appeared."<br/>
