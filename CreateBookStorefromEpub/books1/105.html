"More than that. It is probable. And now you see the deadly<br/>urgency of this new case, and why I urged young Openshaw to<br/>caution. The blow has always fallen at the end of the time which it<br/>would take the senders to travel the distance. But this one comes<br/>from London, and therefore we cannot count upon delay."<br/><br/>"Good God!" I cried. "What can it mean, this relentless<br/>persecution?"<br/><br/>"The papers which Openshaw carried are obviously of vital<br/>importance to the person or persons in the sailing-ship. I think<br/>that it is quite clear that there must be more than one of them. A<br/>single man could not have carried out two deaths in such a way as<br/>to deceive a coroner's jury. There must have been several in it,<br/>and they must have been men of resource and determination. Their<br/>papers they mean to have, be the holder of them who it may. In this<br/>way you see K. K. K. ceases to be the initials of an individual and<br/>becomes the badge of a society."<br/><br/>"But of what society?"<br/><br/>"Have you never—" said Sherlock Holmes, bending forward and<br/>sinking his voice—"have you never heard of the Ku Klux Klan?"<br/><br/>"I never have."<br/><br/>Holmes turned over the leaves of the book upon his knee. "Here<br/>it is," said he presently:<br/><br/>"'Ku Klux Klan. A name derived from the fanciful resemblance to<br/>the sound produced by cocking a rifle. This terrible secret society<br/>was formed by some ex-Confederate soldiers in the Southern states<br/>after the Civil War, and it rapidly formed local branches in<br/>different parts of the country, notably in Tennessee, Louisiana,<br/>the Carolinas, Georgia, and Florida. Its power was used for<br/>political purposes, principally for the terrorising of the negro<br/>voters and the murdering and driving from the country of those who<br/>were opposed to its views. Its outrages were usually preceded by a<br/>warning sent to the marked man in some fantastic but generally<br/>recognised shape—a sprig of oak-leaves in some parts, melon seeds<br/>or orange pips in others. On receiving this the victim might either<br/>openly abjure his former ways, or might fly from the country. If he<br/>braved the matter out, death would unfailingly come upon him, and<br/>usually in some strange and unforeseen manner. So perfect was the<br/>organisation of the society, and so systematic its methods, that<br/>there is hardly a case upon record where any man succeeded in<br/>braving it with impunity, or in which any of its outrages were<br/>traced home to the perpetrators. For some years the organisation<br/>flourished in spite of the efforts of the United States government<br/>and of the better classes of the community in the South.<br/>Eventually, in the year 1869, the movement rather suddenly<br/>collapsed, although there have been sporadic outbreaks of the same<br/>sort since that date.'<br/><br/>"You will observe," said Holmes, laying down the volume, "that<br/>the sudden breaking up of the society was coincident with the<br/>disappearance of Openshaw from America with their papers. It may<br/>well have been cause and effect. It is no wonder that he and his<br/>family have some of the more implacable spirits upon their track.<br/>You can understand that this register and diary may implicate some<br/>of the first men in the South, and that there may be many who will<br/>not sleep easy at night until it is recovered."<br/><br/>"Then the page we have seen—"<br/><br/>"Is such as we might expect. It ran, if I remember right, 'sent<br/>the pips to A, B, and C'—that is, sent the society's warning to<br/>them. Then there are successive entries that A and B cleared, or<br/>left the country, and finally that C was visited, with, I fear, a<br/>sinister result for C. Well, I think, Doctor, that we may let some<br/>light into this dark place, and I believe that the only chance<br/>young Openshaw has in the meantime is to do what I have told him.<br/>There is nothing more to be said or to be done to-night, so hand me<br/>over my violin and let us try to forget for half an hour the<br/>miserable weather and the still more miserable ways of our<br/>fellow-men."<br/>
