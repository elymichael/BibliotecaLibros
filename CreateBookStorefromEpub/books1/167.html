My friend smiled.<br/><br/>"Holmes, the busybody!"<br/><br/>His smile broadened.<br/><br/>"Holmes, the Scotland Yard Jack-in-office!"<br/><br/>Holmes chuckled heartily. "Your conversation is most<br/>entertaining," said he. "When you go out close the door, for there<br/>is a decided draught."<br/><br/>"I will go when I have said my say. Don't you dare to meddle<br/>with my affairs. I know that Miss Stoner has been here. I traced<br/>her! I am a dangerous man to fall foul of! See here." He stepped<br/>swiftly forward, seized the poker, and bent it into a curve with<br/>his huge brown hands.<br/><br/>"See that you keep yourself out of my grip," he snarled, and<br/>hurling the twisted poker into the fireplace he strode out of the<br/>room.<br/><br/>"He seems a very amiable person," said Holmes, laughing. "I am<br/>not quite so bulky, but if he had remained I might have shown him<br/>that my grip was not much more feeble than his own." As he spoke he<br/>picked up the steel poker and, with a sudden effort, straightened<br/>it out again.<br/><br/>"Fancy his having the insolence to confound me with the official<br/>detective force! This incident gives zest to our investigation,<br/>however, and I only trust that our little friend will not suffer<br/>from her imprudence in allowing this brute to trace her. And now,<br/>Watson, we shall order breakfast, and afterwards I shall walk down<br/>to Doctors' Commons, where I hope to get some data which may help<br/>us in this matter."<br/><br/>It was nearly one o'clock when Sherlock Holmes returned from his<br/>excursion. He held in his hand a sheet of blue paper, scrawled over<br/>with notes and figures.<br/><br/>"I have seen the will of the deceased wife," said he. "To<br/>determine its exact meaning I have been obliged to work out the<br/>present prices of the investments with which it is concerned. The<br/>total income, which at the time of the wife's death was little<br/>short of 1100 pounds, is now, through the fall in agricultural<br/>prices, not more than 750 pounds. Each daughter can claim an income<br/>of 250 pounds, in case of marriage. It is evident, therefore, that<br/>if both girls had married, this beauty would have had a mere<br/>pittance, while even one of them would cripple him to a very<br/>serious extent. My morning's work has not been wasted, since it has<br/>proved that he has the very strongest motives for standing in the<br/>way of anything of the sort. And now, Watson, this is too serious<br/>for dawdling, especially as the old man is aware that we are<br/>interesting ourselves in his affairs; so if you are ready, we shall<br/>call a cab and drive to Waterloo. I should be very much obliged if<br/>you would slip your revolver into your pocket. An Eley's No. 2 is<br/>an excellent argument with gentlemen who can twist steel pokers<br/>into knots. That and a tooth-brush are, I think, all that we<br/>need."<br/>
