<br/>"Pray be precise as to details," said he.<br/><br/>"It is easy for me to be so, for every event of that dreadful<br/>time is seared into my memory. The manor-house is, as I have<br/>already said, very old, and only one wing is now inhabited. The<br/>bedrooms in this wing are on the ground floor, the sitting-rooms<br/>being in the central block of the buildings. Of these bedrooms the<br/>first is Dr. Roylott's, the second my sister's, and the third my<br/>own. There is no communication between them, but they all open out<br/>into the same corridor. Do I make myself plain?"<br/><br/>"Perfectly so."<br/><br/>"The windows of the three rooms open out upon the lawn. That<br/>fatal night Dr. Roylott had gone to his room early, though we knew<br/>that he had not retired to rest, for my sister was troubled by the<br/>smell of the strong Indian cigars which it was his custom to smoke.<br/>She left her room, therefore, and came into mine, where she sat for<br/>some time, chatting about her approaching wedding. At eleven<br/>o'clock she rose to leave me, but she paused at the door and looked<br/>back.<br/><br/>"'Tell me, Helen,' said she, 'have you ever heard anyone whistle<br/>in the dead of the night?'<br/><br/>"'Never,' said I.<br/><br/>"'I suppose that you could not possibly whistle, yourself, in<br/>your sleep?'<br/><br/>"'Certainly not. But why?'<br/><br/>"'Because during the last few nights I have always, about three<br/>in the morning, heard a low, clear whistle. I am a light sleeper,<br/>and it has awakened me. I cannot tell where it came fromâ€”perhaps<br/>from the next room, perhaps from the lawn. I thought that I would<br/>just ask you whether you had heard it.'<br/><br/>"'No, I have not. It must be those wretched gipsies in the<br/>plantation.'<br/><br/>
