"Yes, I have been dragging the Serpentine."<br/><br/>"In heaven's name, what for?"<br/><br/>"In search of the body of Lady St. Simon."<br/><br/>Sherlock Holmes leaned back in his chair and laughed<br/>heartily.<br/><br/>"Have you dragged the basin of Trafalgar Square fountain?" he<br/>asked.<br/><br/>"Why? What do you mean?"<br/><br/>"Because you have just as good a chance of finding this lady in<br/>the one as in the other."<br/><br/>Lestrade shot an angry glance at my companion. "I suppose you<br/>know all about it," he snarled.<br/><br/>"Well, I have only just heard the facts, but my mind is made<br/>up."<br/><br/>"Oh, indeed! Then you think that the Serpentine plays no part in<br/>the matter?"<br/><br/>"I think it very unlikely."<br/>
