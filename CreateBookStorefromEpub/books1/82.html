<br/>"Ah! who? I would call your attention very particularly to two<br/>points. One is that the murdered man had an appointment with<br/>someone at the pool, and that the someone could not have been his<br/>son, for his son was away, and he did not know when he would<br/>return. The second is that the murdered man was heard to cry<br/>'Cooee!' before he knew that his son had returned. Those are the<br/>crucial points upon which the case depends. And now let us talk<br/>about George Meredith, if you please, and we shall leave all minor<br/>matters until to-morrow."<br/><br/>There was no rain, as Holmes had foretold, and the morning broke<br/>bright and cloudless. At nine o'clock Lestrade called for us with<br/>the carriage, and we set off for Hatherley Farm and the Boscombe<br/>Pool.<br/><br/>"There is serious news this morning," Lestrade observed. "It is<br/>said that Mr. Turner, of the Hall, is so ill that his life is<br/>despaired of."<br/><br/>"An elderly man, I presume?" said Holmes.<br/><br/>"About sixty; but his constitution has been shattered by his<br/>life abroad, and he has been in failing health for some time. This<br/>business has had a very bad effect upon him. He was an old friend<br/>of McCarthy's, and, I may add, a great benefactor to him, for I<br/>have learned that he gave him Hatherley Farm rent free."<br/><br/>"Indeed! That is interesting," said Holmes.<br/><br/>"Oh, yes! In a hundred other ways he has helped him. Everybody<br/>about here speaks of his kindness to him."<br/><br/>"Really! Does it not strike you as a little singular that this<br/>McCarthy, who appears to have had little of his own, and to have<br/>been under such obligations to Turner, should still talk of<br/>marrying his son to Turner's daughter, who is, presumably, heiress<br/>to the estate, and that in such a very cocksure manner, as if it<br/>were merely a case of a proposal and all else would follow? It is<br/>the more strange, since we know that Turner himself was averse to<br/>the idea. The daughter told us as much. Do you not deduce something<br/>from that?"<br/><br/>"We have got to the deductions and the inferences," said<br/>Lestrade, winking at me. "I find it hard enough to tackle facts,<br/>Holmes, without flying away after theories and fancies."<br/><br/>"You are right," said Holmes demurely; "you do find it very hard<br/>to tackle the facts."<br/><br/>
