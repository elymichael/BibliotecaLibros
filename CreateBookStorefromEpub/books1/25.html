"He's a brave fellow," said a woman. "They would have had the<br/>lady's purse and watch if it hadn't been for him. They were a gang,<br/>and a rough one, too. Ah, he's breathing now."<br/><br/>"He can't lie in the street. May we bring him in, marm?"<br/><br/>"Surely. Bring him into the sitting-room. There is a comfortable<br/>sofa. This way, please!"<br/><br/>Slowly and solemnly he was borne into Briony Lodge and laid out<br/>in the principal room, while I still observed the proceedings from<br/>my post by the window. The lamps had been lit, but the blinds had<br/>not been drawn, so that I could see Holmes as he lay upon the<br/>couch. I do not know whether he was seized with compunction at that<br/>moment for the part he was playing, but I know that I never felt<br/>more heartily ashamed of myself in my life than when I saw the<br/>beautiful creature against whom I was conspiring, or the grace and<br/>kindliness with which she waited upon the injured man. And yet it<br/>would be the blackest treachery to Holmes to draw back now from the<br/>part which he had intrusted to me. I hardened my heart, and took<br/>the smoke-rocket from under my ulster. After all, I thought, we are<br/>not injuring her. We are but preventing her from injuring<br/>another.<br/><br/>Holmes had sat up upon the couch, and I saw him motion like a<br/>man who is in need of air. A maid rushed across and threw open the<br/>window. At the same instant I saw him raise his hand and at the<br/>signal I tossed my rocket into the room with a cry of "Fire!" The<br/>word was no sooner out of my mouth than the whole crowd of<br/>spectators, well dressed and ill—gentlemen, ostlers, and<br/>servant-maids—joined in a general shriek of "Fire!" Thick clouds of<br/>smoke curled through the room and out at the open window. I caught<br/>a glimpse of rushing figures, and a moment later the voice of<br/>Holmes from within assuring them that it was a false alarm.<br/>Slipping through the shouting crowd I made my way to the corner of<br/>the street, and in ten minutes was rejoiced to find my friend's arm<br/>in mine, and to get away from the scene of uproar. He walked<br/>swiftly and in silence for some few minutes until we had turned<br/>down one of the quiet streets which lead towards the Edgeware<br/>Road.<br/><br/>"You did it very nicely, Doctor," he remarked. "Nothing could<br/>have been better. It is all right."<br/><br/>"You have the photograph?"<br/><br/>"I know where it is."<br/><br/>"And how did you find out?"<br/><br/>"She showed me, as I told you she would."<br/><br/>"I am still in the dark."<br/>
