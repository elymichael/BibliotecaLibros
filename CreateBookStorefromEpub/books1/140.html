<br/>"A diamond, sir? A precious stone. It cuts into glass as though<br/>it were putty."<br/><br/>"It's more than a precious stone. It is the precious stone."<br/><br/>"Not the Countess of Morcar's blue carbuncle!" I ejaculated.<br/><br/>"Precisely so. I ought to know its size and shape, seeing that I<br/>have read the advertisement about it in The Times every day lately.<br/>It is absolutely unique, and its value can only be conjectured, but<br/>the reward offered of 1000 pounds is certainly not within a<br/>twentieth part of the market price."<br/><br/>"A thousand pounds! Great Lord of mercy!" The commissionaire<br/>plumped down into a chair and stared from one to the other of<br/>us.<br/><br/>"That is the reward, and I have reason to know that there are<br/>sentimental considerations in the background which would induce the<br/>Countess to part with half her fortune if she could but recover the<br/>gem."<br/><br/>"It was lost, if I remember aright, at the Hotel Cosmopolitan,"<br/>I remarked.<br/><br/>"Precisely so, on December 22nd, just five days ago. John<br/>Horner, a plumber, was accused of having abstracted it from the<br/>lady's jewel-case. The evidence against him was so strong that the<br/>case has been referred to the Assizes. I have some account of the<br/>matter here, I believe." He rummaged amid his newspapers, glancing<br/>over the dates, until at last he smoothed one out, doubled it over,<br/>and read the following paragraph:<br/><br/>"Hotel Cosmopolitan Jewel Robbery. John Horner, 26, plumber, was<br/>brought up upon the charge of having upon the 22nd inst.,<br/>abstracted from the jewel-case of the Countess of Morcar the<br/>valuable gem known as the blue carbuncle. James Ryder,<br/>upper-attendant at the hotel, gave his evidence to the effect that<br/>he had shown Horner up to the dressing-room of the Countess of<br/>Morcar upon the day of the robbery in order that he might solder<br/>the second bar of the grate, which was loose. He had remained with<br/>Horner some little time, but had finally been called away. On<br/>returning, he found that Horner had disappeared, that the bureau<br/>had been forced open, and that the small morocco casket in which,<br/>as it afterwards transpired, the Countess was accustomed to keep<br/>her jewel, was lying empty upon the dressing-table. Ryder instantly<br/>gave the alarm, and Horner was arrested the same evening; but the<br/>stone could not be found either upon his person or in his rooms.<br/>Catherine Cusack, maid to the Countess, deposed to having heard<br/>Ryder's cry of dismay on discovering the robbery, and to having<br/>rushed into the room, where she found matters as described by the<br/>last witness. Inspector Bradstreet, B division, gave evidence as to<br/>the arrest of Horner, who struggled frantically, and protested his<br/>innocence in the strongest terms. Evidence of a previous conviction<br/>for robbery having been given against the prisoner, the magistrate<br/>refused to deal summarily with the offence, but referred it to the<br/>Assizes. Horner, who had shown signs of intense emotion during the<br/>proceedings, fainted away at the conclusion and was carried out of<br/>court."<br/><br/>"Hum! So much for the police-court," said Holmes thoughtfully,<br/>tossing aside the paper. "The question for us now to solve is the<br/>sequence of events leading from a rifled jewel-case at one end to<br/>the crop of a goose in Tottenham Court Road at the other. You see,<br/>Watson, our little deductions have suddenly assumed a much more<br/>important and less innocent aspect. Here is the stone; the stone<br/>came from the goose, and the goose came from Mr. Henry Baker, the<br/>gentleman with the bad hat and all the other characteristics with<br/>which I have bored you. So now we must set ourselves very seriously<br/>to finding this gentleman and ascertaining what part he has played<br/>in this little mystery. To do this, we must try the simplest means<br/>first, and these lie undoubtedly in an advertisement in all the<br/>evening papers. If this fail, I shall have recourse to other<br/>methods."<br/><br/>
