Our client of the morning had hurried forward to meet us with a<br/>face which spoke her joy. "I have been waiting so eagerly for you,"<br/>she cried, shaking hands with us warmly. "All has turned out<br/>splendidly. Dr. Roylott has gone to town, and it is unlikely that<br/>he will be back before evening."<br/><br/>"We have had the pleasure of making the doctor's acquaintance,"<br/>said Holmes, and in a few words he sketched out what had occurred.<br/>Miss Stoner turned white to the lips as she listened.<br/><br/>"Good heavens!" she cried, "he has followed me, then."<br/><br/>"So it appears."<br/><br/>"He is so cunning that I never know when I am safe from him.<br/>What will he say when he returns?"<br/><br/>"He must guard himself, for he may find that there is someone<br/>more cunning than himself upon his track. You must lock yourself up<br/>from him to-night. If he is violent, we shall take you away to your<br/>aunt's at Harrow. Now, we must make the best use of our time, so<br/>kindly take us at once to the rooms which we are to examine."<br/><br/>The building was of grey, lichen-blotched stone, with a high<br/>central portion and two curving wings, like the claws of a crab,<br/>thrown out on each side. In one of these wings the windows were<br/>broken and blocked with wooden boards, while the roof was partly<br/>caved in, a picture of ruin. The central portion was in little<br/>better repair, but the right-hand block was comparatively modern,<br/>and the blinds in the windows, with the blue smoke curling up from<br/>the chimneys, showed that this was where the family resided. Some<br/>scaffolding had been erected against the end wall, and the<br/>stone-work had been broken into, but there were no signs of any<br/>workmen at the moment of our visit. Holmes walked slowly up and<br/>down the ill-trimmed lawn and examined with deep attention the<br/>outsides of the windows.<br/><br/>"This, I take it, belongs to the room in which you used to<br/>sleep, the centre one to your sister's, and the one next to the<br/>main building to Dr. Roylott's chamber?"<br/><br/>"Exactly so. But I am now sleeping in the middle one."<br/><br/>"Pending the alterations, as I understand. By the way, there<br/>does not seem to be any very pressing need for repairs at that end<br/>wall."<br/><br/>"There were none. I believe that it was an excuse to move me<br/>from my room."<br/>
