"The newcomers were Colonel Lysander Stark and a short thick man<br/>with a chinchilla beard growing out of the creases of his double<br/>chin, who was introduced to me as Mr. Ferguson.<br/><br/>"'This is my secretary and manager,' said the colonel. 'By the<br/>way, I was under the impression that I left this door shut just<br/>now. I fear that you have felt the draught.'<br/><br/>"'On the contrary,' said I, 'I opened the door myself because I<br/>felt the room to be a little close.'<br/><br/>"He shot one of his suspicious looks at me. 'Perhaps we had<br/>better proceed to business, then,' said he. 'Mr. Ferguson and I<br/>will take you up to see the machine.'<br/><br/>"'I had better put my hat on, I suppose.'<br/><br/>"'Oh, no, it is in the house.'<br/><br/>"'What, you dig fuller's-earth in the house?'<br/><br/>"'No, no. This is only where we compress it. But never mind<br/>that. All we wish you to do is to examine the machine and to let us<br/>know what is wrong with it.'<br/><br/>"We went upstairs together, the colonel first with the lamp, the<br/>fat manager and I behind him. It was a labyrinth of an old house,<br/>with corridors, passages, narrow winding staircases, and little low<br/>doors, the thresholds of which were hollowed out by the generations<br/>who had crossed them. There were no carpets and no signs of any<br/>furniture above the ground floor, while the plaster was peeling off<br/>the walls, and the damp was breaking through in green, unhealthy<br/>blotches. I tried to put on as unconcerned an air as possible, but<br/>I had not forgotten the warnings of the lady, even though I<br/>disregarded them, and I kept a keen eye upon my two companions.<br/>Ferguson appeared to be a morose and silent man, but I could see<br/>from the little that he said that he was at least a<br/>fellow-countryman.<br/><br/>"Colonel Lysander Stark stopped at last before a low door, which<br/>he unlocked. Within was a small, square room, in which the three of<br/>us could hardly get at one time. Ferguson remained outside, and the<br/>colonel ushered me in.<br/><br/>"'We are now,' said he, 'actually within the hydraulic press,<br/>and it would be a particularly unpleasant thing for us if anyone<br/>were to turn it on. The ceiling of this small chamber is really the<br/>end of the descending piston, and it comes down with the force of<br/>many tons upon this metal floor. There are small lateral columns of<br/>water outside which receive the force, and which transmit and<br/>multiply it in the manner which is familiar to you. The machine<br/>goes readily enough, but there is some stiffness in the working of<br/>it, and it has lost a little of its force. Perhaps you will have<br/>the goodness to look it over and to show us how we can set it<br/>right.'<br/>
