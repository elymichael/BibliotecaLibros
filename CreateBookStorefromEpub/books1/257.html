"Let us have everything in its due order." Holmes thrust his<br/>long thin legs out towards the fire and composed himself to<br/>listen.<br/><br/>"In the first place, I may say that I have met, on the whole,<br/>with no actual ill-treatment from Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle. It is only<br/>fair to them to say that. But I cannot understand them, and I am<br/>not easy in my mind about them."<br/><br/>"What can you not understand?"<br/><br/>"Their reasons for their conduct. But you shall have it all just<br/>as it occurred. When I came down, Mr. Rucastle met me here and<br/>drove me in his dog-cart to the Copper Beeches. It is, as he said,<br/>beautifully situated, but it is not beautiful in itself, for it is<br/>a large square block of a house, whitewashed, but all stained and<br/>streaked with damp and bad weather. There are grounds round it,<br/>woods on three sides, and on the fourth a field which slopes down<br/>to the Southampton highroad, which curves past about a hundred<br/>yards from the front door. This ground in front belongs to the<br/>house, but the woods all round are part of Lord Southerton's<br/>preserves. A clump of copper beeches immediately in front of the<br/>hall door has given its name to the place.<br/><br/>"I was driven over by my employer, who was as amiable as ever,<br/>and was introduced by him that evening to his wife and the child.<br/>There was no truth, Mr. Holmes, in the conjecture which seemed to<br/>us to be probable in your rooms at Baker Street. Mrs. Rucastle is<br/>not mad. I found her to be a silent, pale-faced woman, much younger<br/>than her husband, not more than thirty, I should think, while he<br/>can hardly be less than forty-five. From their conversation I have<br/>gathered that they have been married about seven years, that he was<br/>a widower, and that his only child by the first wife was the<br/>daughter who has gone to Philadelphia. Mr. Rucastle told me in<br/>private that the reason why she had left them was that she had an<br/>unreasoning aversion to her stepmother. As the daughter could not<br/>have been less than twenty, I can quite imagine that her position<br/>must have been uncomfortable with her father's young wife.<br/><br/>"Mrs. Rucastle seemed to me to be colourless in mind as well as<br/>in feature. She impressed me neither favourably nor the reverse.<br/>She was a nonentity. It was easy to see that she was passionately<br/>devoted both to her husband and to her little son. Her light grey<br/>eyes wandered continually from one to the other, noting every<br/>little want and forestalling it if possible. He was kind to her<br/>also in his bluff, boisterous fashion, and on the whole they seemed<br/>to be a happy couple. And yet she had some secret sorrow, this<br/>woman. She would often be lost in deep thought, with the saddest<br/>look upon her face. More than once I have surprised her in tears. I<br/>have thought sometimes that it was the disposition of her child<br/>which weighed upon her mind, for I have never met so utterly<br/>spoiled and so ill-natured a little creature. He is small for his<br/>age, with a head which is quite disproportionately large. His whole<br/>life appears to be spent in an alternation between savage fits of<br/>passion and gloomy intervals of sulking. Giving pain to any<br/>creature weaker than himself seems to be his one idea of amusement,<br/>and he shows quite remarkable talent in planning the capture of<br/>mice, little birds, and insects. But I would rather not talk about<br/>the creature, Mr. Holmes, and, indeed, he has little to do with my<br/>story."<br/><br/>"I am glad of all details," remarked my friend, "whether they<br/>seem to you to be relevant or not."<br/><br/>"I shall try not to miss anything of importance. The one<br/>unpleasant thing about the house, which struck me at once, was the<br/>appearance and conduct of the servants. There are only two, a man<br/>and his wife. Toller, for that is his name, is a rough, uncouth<br/>man, with grizzled hair and whiskers, and a perpetual smell of<br/>drink. Twice since I have been with them he has been quite drunk,<br/>and yet Mr. Rucastle seemed to take no notice of it. His wife is a<br/>very tall and strong woman with a sour face, as silent as Mrs.<br/>Rucastle and much less amiable. They are a most unpleasant couple,<br/>but fortunately I spend most of my time in the nursery and my own<br/>room, which are next to each other in one corner of the<br/>building.<br/><br/>"For two days after my arrival at the Copper Beeches my life was<br/>very quiet; on the third, Mrs. Rucastle came down just after<br/>breakfast and whispered something to her husband.<br/><br/>"'Oh, yes,' said he, turning to me, 'we are very much obliged to<br/>you, Miss Hunter, for falling in with our whims so far as to cut<br/>your hair. I assure you that it has not detracted in the tiniest<br/>iota from your appearance. We shall now see how the electric-blue<br/>dress will become you. You will find it laid out upon the bed in<br/>your room, and if you would be so good as to put it on we should<br/>both be extremely obliged.'<br/><br/>"The dress which I found waiting for me was of a peculiar shade<br/>of blue. It was of excellent material, a sort of beige, but it bore<br/>unmistakable signs of having been worn before. It could not have<br/>been a better fit if I had been measured for it. Both Mr. and Mrs.<br/>Rucastle expressed a delight at the look of it, which seemed quite<br/>exaggerated in its vehemence. They were waiting for me in the<br/>drawing-room, which is a very large room, stretching along the<br/>entire front of the house, with three long windows reaching down to<br/>the floor. A chair had been placed close to the central window,<br/>with its back turned towards it. In this I was asked to sit, and<br/>then Mr. Rucastle, walking up and down on the other side of the<br/>room, began to tell me a series of the funniest stories that I have<br/>ever listened to. You cannot imagine how comical he was, and I<br/>laughed until I was quite weary. Mrs. Rucastle, however, who has<br/>evidently no sense of humour, never so much as smiled, but sat with<br/>her hands in her lap, and a sad, anxious look upon her face. After<br/>an hour or so, Mr. Rucastle suddenly remarked that it was time to<br/>commence the duties of the day, and that I might change my dress<br/>and go to little Edward in the nursery.<br/>
