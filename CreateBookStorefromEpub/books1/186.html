<br/>"Oh, no, not now. I shall have to tell my tale to the police;<br/>but, between ourselves, if it were not for the convincing evidence<br/>of this wound of mine, I should be surprised if they believed my<br/>statement, for it is a very extraordinary one, and I have not much<br/>in the way of proof with which to back it up; and, even if they<br/>believe me, the clues which I can give them are so vague that it is<br/>a question whether justice will be done."<br/><br/>"Ha!" cried I, "if it is anything in the nature of a problem<br/>which you desire to see solved, I should strongly recommend you to<br/>come to my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, before you go to the<br/>official police."<br/><br/>"Oh, I have heard of that fellow," answered my visitor, "and I<br/>should be very glad if he would take the matter up, though of<br/>course I must use the official police as well. Would you give me an<br/>introduction to him?"<br/><br/>"I'll do better. I'll take you round to him myself."<br/><br/>"I should be immensely obliged to you."<br/><br/>"We'll call a cab and go together. We shall just be in time to<br/>have a little breakfast with him. Do you feel equal to it?"<br/><br/>"Yes; I shall not feel easy until I have told my story."<br/><br/>"Then my servant will call a cab, and I shall be with you in an<br/>instant." I rushed upstairs, explained the matter shortly to my<br/>wife, and in five minutes was inside a hansom, driving with my new<br/>acquaintance to Baker Street.<br/><br/>Sherlock Holmes was, as I expected, lounging about his<br/>sitting-room in his dressing-gown, reading the agony column of The<br/>Times and smoking his before-breakfast pipe, which was composed of<br/>all the plugs and dottles left from his smokes of the day before,<br/>all carefully dried and collected on the corner of the mantelpiece.<br/>He received us in his quietly genial fashion, ordered fresh rashers<br/>and eggs, and joined us in a hearty meal. When it was concluded he<br/>settled our new acquaintance upon the sofa, placed a pillow beneath<br/>his head, and laid a glass of brandy and water within his<br/>reach.<br/><br/>"It is easy to see that your experience has been no common one,<br/>Mr. Hatherley," said he. "Pray, lie down there and make yourself<br/>absolutely at home. Tell us what you can, but stop when you are<br/>tired and keep up your strength with a little stimulant."<br/><br/>
