<br/>"My dear Holmes!"<br/><br/>"I have notes of several similar cases, though none, as I<br/>remarked before, which were quite as prompt. My whole examination<br/>served to turn my conjecture into a certainty. Circumstantial<br/>evidence is occasionally very convincing, as when you find a trout<br/>in the milk, to quote Thoreau's example."<br/><br/>"But I have heard all that you have heard."<br/><br/>"Without, however, the knowledge of pre-existing cases which<br/>serves me so well. There was a parallel instance in Aberdeen some<br/>years back, and something on very much the same lines at Munich the<br/>year after the Franco-Prussian War. It is one of these casesâ€”but,<br/>hullo, here is Lestrade! Good-afternoon, Lestrade! You will find an<br/>extra tumbler upon the sideboard, and there are cigars in the<br/>box."<br/><br/>The official detective was attired in a pea-jacket and cravat,<br/>which gave him a decidedly nautical appearance, and he carried a<br/>black canvas bag in his hand. With a short greeting he seated<br/>himself and lit the cigar which had been offered to him.<br/><br/>"What's up, then?" asked Holmes with a twinkle in his eye. "You<br/>look dissatisfied."<br/><br/>"And I feel dissatisfied. It is this infernal St. Simon marriage<br/>case. I can make neither head nor tail of the business."<br/><br/>"Really! You surprise me."<br/><br/>"Who ever heard of such a mixed affair? Every clue seems to slip<br/>through my fingers. I have been at work upon it all day."<br/><br/>"And very wet it seems to have made you," said Holmes laying his<br/>hand upon the arm of the pea-jacket.<br/><br/>
