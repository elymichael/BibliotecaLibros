<br/>"He looked surprised and, as it seemed to me, a little startled<br/>at my remark.<br/><br/>"'Photography is one of my hobbies,' said he. 'I have made my<br/>dark room up there. But, dear me! what an observant young lady we<br/>have come upon. Who would have believed it? Who would have ever<br/>believed it?' He spoke in a jesting tone, but there was no jest in<br/>his eyes as he looked at me. I read suspicion there and annoyance,<br/>but no jest.<br/><br/>"Well, Mr. Holmes, from the moment that I understood that there<br/>was something about that suite of rooms which I was not to know, I<br/>was all on fire to go over them. It was not mere curiosity, though<br/>I have my share of that. It was more a feeling of duty—a feeling<br/>that some good might come from my penetrating to this place. They<br/>talk of woman's instinct; perhaps it was woman's instinct which<br/>gave me that feeling. At any rate, it was there, and I was keenly<br/>on the lookout for any chance to pass the forbidden door.<br/><br/>"It was only yesterday that the chance came. I may tell you<br/>that, besides Mr. Rucastle, both Toller and his wife find something<br/>to do in these deserted rooms, and I once saw him carrying a large<br/>black linen bag with him through the door. Recently he has been<br/>drinking hard, and yesterday evening he was very drunk; and when I<br/>came upstairs there was the key in the door. I have no doubt at all<br/>that he had left it there. Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle were both<br/>downstairs, and the child was with them, so that I had an admirable<br/>opportunity. I turned the key gently in the lock, opened the door,<br/>and slipped through.<br/><br/>"There was a little passage in front of me, unpapered and<br/>uncarpeted, which turned at a right angle at the farther end. Round<br/>this corner were three doors in a line, the first and third of<br/>which were open. They each led into an empty room, dusty and<br/>cheerless, with two windows in the one and one in the other, so<br/>thick with dirt that the evening light glimmered dimly through<br/>them. The centre door was closed, and across the outside of it had<br/>been fastened one of the broad bars of an iron bed, padlocked at<br/>one end to a ring in the wall, and fastened at the other with stout<br/>cord. The door itself was locked as well, and the key was not<br/>there. This barricaded door corresponded clearly with the shuttered<br/>window outside, and yet I could see by the glimmer from beneath it<br/>that the room was not in darkness. Evidently there was a skylight<br/>which let in light from above. As I stood in the passage gazing at<br/>the sinister door and wondering what secret it might veil, I<br/>suddenly heard the sound of steps within the room and saw a shadow<br/>pass backward and forward against the little slit of dim light<br/>which shone out from under the door. A mad, unreasoning terror rose<br/>up in me at the sight, Mr. Holmes. My overstrung nerves failed me<br/>suddenly, and I turned and ran—ran as though some dreadful hand<br/>were behind me clutching at the skirt of my dress. I rushed down<br/>the passage, through the door, and straight into the arms of Mr.<br/>Rucastle, who was waiting outside.<br/><br/>"'So,' said he, smiling, 'it was you, then. I thought that it<br/>must be when I saw the door open.'<br/><br/>"'Oh, I am so frightened!' I panted.<br/><br/>"'My dear young lady! my dear young lady!'—you cannot think how<br/>caressing and soothing his manner was—'and what has frightened you,<br/>my dear young lady?'<br/><br/>"But his voice was just a little too coaxing. He overdid it. I<br/>was keenly on my guard against him.<br/><br/>"'I was foolish enough to go into the empty wing,' I answered.<br/>'But it is so lonely and eerie in this dim light that I was<br/>frightened and ran out again. Oh, it is so dreadfully still in<br/>there!'<br/><br/>
