"No, no; the real name," said Holmes sweetly. "It is always<br/>awkward doing business with an alias."<br/><br/>A flush sprang to the white cheeks of the stranger. "Well then,"<br/>said he, "my real name is James Ryder."<br/><br/>"Precisely so. Head attendant at the Hotel Cosmopolitan. Pray<br/>step into the cab, and I shall soon be able to tell you everything<br/>which you would wish to know."<br/><br/>The little man stood glancing from one to the other of us with<br/>half-frightened, half-hopeful eyes, as one who is not sure whether<br/>he is on the verge of a windfall or of a catastrophe. Then he<br/>stepped into the cab, and in half an hour we were back in the<br/>sitting-room at Baker Street. Nothing had been said during our<br/>drive, but the high, thin breathing of our new companion, and the<br/>claspings and unclaspings of his hands, spoke of the nervous<br/>tension within him.<br/><br/>"Here we are!" said Holmes cheerily as we filed into the room.<br/>"The fire looks very seasonable in this weather. You look cold, Mr.<br/>Ryder. Pray take the basket-chair. I will just put on my slippers<br/>before we settle this little matter of yours. Now, then! You want<br/>to know what became of those geese?"<br/><br/>"Yes, sir."<br/><br/>"Or rather, I fancy, of that goose. It was one bird, I imagine<br/>in which you were interested—white, with a black bar across the<br/>tail."<br/><br/>Ryder quivered with emotion. "Oh, sir," he cried, "can you tell<br/>me where it went to?"<br/><br/>"It came here."<br/><br/>"Here?"<br/><br/>"Yes, and a most remarkable bird it proved. I don't wonder that<br/>you should take an interest in it. It laid an egg after it was<br/>dead—the bonniest, brightest little blue egg that ever was seen. I<br/>have it here in my museum."<br/>
