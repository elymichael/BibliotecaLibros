<br/>"Thank you. I am sorry to have interrupted you. Pray continue<br/>your most interesting statement."<br/><br/>"Away we went then, and we drove for at least an hour. Colonel<br/>Lysander Stark had said that it was only seven miles, but I should<br/>think, from the rate that we seemed to go, and from the time that<br/>we took, that it must have been nearer twelve. He sat at my side in<br/>silence all the time, and I was aware, more than once when I<br/>glanced in his direction, that he was looking at me with great<br/>intensity. The country roads seem to be not very good in that part<br/>of the world, for we lurched and jolted terribly. I tried to look<br/>out of the windows to see something of where we were, but they were<br/>made of frosted glass, and I could make out nothing save the<br/>occasional bright blur of a passing light. Now and then I hazarded<br/>some remark to break the monotony of the journey, but the colonel<br/>answered only in monosyllables, and the conversation soon flagged.<br/>At last, however, the bumping of the road was exchanged for the<br/>crisp smoothness of a gravel-drive, and the carriage came to a<br/>stand. Colonel Lysander Stark sprang out, and, as I followed after<br/>him, pulled me swiftly into a porch which gaped in front of us. We<br/>stepped, as it were, right out of the carriage and into the hall,<br/>so that I failed to catch the most fleeting glance of the front of<br/>the house. The instant that I had crossed the threshold the door<br/>slammed heavily behind us, and I heard faintly the rattle of the<br/>wheels as the carriage drove away.<br/><br/>"It was pitch dark inside the house, and the colonel fumbled<br/>about looking for matches and muttering under his breath. Suddenly<br/>a door opened at the other end of the passage, and a long, golden<br/>bar of light shot out in our direction. It grew broader, and a<br/>woman appeared with a lamp in her hand, which she held above her<br/>head, pushing her face forward and peering at us. I could see that<br/>she was pretty, and from the gloss with which the light shone upon<br/>her dark dress I knew that it was a rich material. She spoke a few<br/>words in a foreign tongue in a tone as though asking a question,<br/>and when my companion answered in a gruff monosyllable she gave<br/>such a start that the lamp nearly fell from her hand. Colonel Stark<br/>went up to her, whispered something in her ear, and then, pushing<br/>her back into the room from whence she had come, he walked towards<br/>me again with the lamp in his hand.<br/><br/>"'Perhaps you will have the kindness to wait in this room for a<br/>few minutes,' said he, throwing open another door. It was a quiet,<br/>little, plainly furnished room, with a round table in the centre,<br/>on which several German books were scattered. Colonel Stark laid<br/>down the lamp on the top of a harmonium beside the door. 'I shall<br/>not keep you waiting an instant,' said he, and vanished into the<br/>darkness.<br/><br/>"I glanced at the books upon the table, and in spite of my<br/>ignorance of German I could see that two of them were treatises on<br/>science, the others being volumes of poetry. Then I walked across<br/>to the window, hoping that I might catch some glimpse of the<br/>country-side, but an oak shutter, heavily barred, was folded across<br/>it. It was a wonderfully silent house. There was an old clock<br/>ticking loudly somewhere in the passage, but otherwise everything<br/>was deadly still. A vague feeling of uneasiness began to steal over<br/>me. Who were these German people, and what were they doing living<br/>in this strange, out-of-the-way place? And where was the place? I<br/>was ten miles or so from Eyford, that was all I knew, but whether<br/>north, south, east, or west I had no idea. For that matter,<br/>Reading, and possibly other large towns, were within that radius,<br/>so the place might not be so secluded, after all. Yet it was quite<br/>certain, from the absolute stillness, that we were in the country.<br/>I paced up and down the room, humming a tune under my breath to<br/>keep up my spirits and feeling that I was thoroughly earning my<br/>fifty-guinea fee.<br/><br/>"Suddenly, without any preliminary sound in the midst of the<br/>utter stillness, the door of my room swung slowly open. The woman<br/>was standing in the aperture, the darkness of the hall behind her,<br/>the yellow light from my lamp beating upon her eager and beautiful<br/>face. I could see at a glance that she was sick with fear, and the<br/>sight sent a chill to my own heart. She held up one shaking finger<br/>to warn me to be silent, and she shot a few whispered words of<br/>broken English at me, her eyes glancing back, like those of a<br/>frightened horse, into the gloom behind her.<br/><br/>"'I would go,' said she, trying hard, as it seemed to me, to<br/>speak calmly; 'I would go. I should not stay here. There is no good<br/>for you to do.'<br/><br/>"'But, madam,' said I, 'I have not yet done what I came for. I<br/>cannot possibly leave until I have seen the machine.'<br/><br/>"'It is not worth your while to wait,' she went on. 'You can<br/>pass through the door; no one hinders.' And then, seeing that I<br/>smiled and shook my head, she suddenly threw aside her constraint<br/>and made a step forward, with her hands wrung together. 'For the<br/>love of Heaven!' she whispered, 'get away from here before it is<br/>too late!'<br/><br/>"But I am somewhat headstrong by nature, and the more ready to<br/>engage in an affair when there is some obstacle in the way. I<br/>thought of my fifty-guinea fee, of my wearisome journey, and of the<br/>unpleasant night which seemed to be before me. Was it all to go for<br/>nothing? Why should I slink away without having carried out my<br/>commission, and without the payment which was my due? This woman<br/>might, for all I knew, be a monomaniac. With a stout bearing,<br/>therefore, though her manner had shaken me more than I cared to<br/>confess, I still shook my head and declared my intention of<br/>remaining where I was. She was about to renew her entreaties when a<br/>door slammed overhead, and the sound of several footsteps was heard<br/>upon the stairs. She listened for an instant, threw up her hands<br/>with a despairing gesture, and vanished as suddenly and as<br/>noiselessly as she had come.<br/><br/>
