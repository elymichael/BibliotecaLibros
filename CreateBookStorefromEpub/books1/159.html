"I am all attention, madam."<br/><br/>"My name is Helen Stoner, and I am living with my stepfather,<br/>who is the last survivor of one of the oldest Saxon families in<br/>England, the Roylotts of Stoke Moran, on the western border of<br/>Surrey."<br/><br/>Holmes nodded his head. "The name is familiar to me," said<br/>he.<br/><br/>"The family was at one time among the richest in England, and<br/>the estates extended over the borders into Berkshire in the north,<br/>and Hampshire in the west. In the last century, however, four<br/>successive heirs were of a dissolute and wasteful disposition, and<br/>the family ruin was eventually completed by a gambler in the days<br/>of the Regency. Nothing was left save a few acres of ground, and<br/>the two-hundred-year-old house, which is itself crushed under a<br/>heavy mortgage. The last squire dragged out his existence there,<br/>living the horrible life of an aristocratic pauper; but his only<br/>son, my stepfather, seeing that he must adapt himself to the new<br/>conditions, obtained an advance from a relative, which enabled him<br/>to take a medical degree and went out to Calcutta, where, by his<br/>professional skill and his force of character, he established a<br/>large practice. In a fit of anger, however, caused by some<br/>robberies which had been perpetrated in the house, he beat his<br/>native butler to death and narrowly escaped a capital sentence. As<br/>it was, he suffered a long term of imprisonment and afterwards<br/>returned to England a morose and disappointed man.<br/><br/>"When Dr. Roylott was in India he married my mother, Mrs.<br/>Stoner, the young widow of Major-General Stoner, of the Bengal<br/>Artillery. My sister Julia and I were twins, and we were only two<br/>years old at the time of my mother's re-marriage. She had a<br/>considerable sum of money—not less than 1000 pounds a year—and this<br/>she bequeathed to Dr. Roylott entirely while we resided with him,<br/>with a provision that a certain annual sum should be allowed to<br/>each of us in the event of our marriage. Shortly after our return<br/>to England my mother died—she was killed eight years ago in a<br/>railway accident near Crewe. Dr. Roylott then abandoned his<br/>attempts to establish himself in practice in London and took us to<br/>live with him in the old ancestral house at Stoke Moran. The money<br/>which my mother had left was enough for all our wants, and there<br/>seemed to be no obstacle to our happiness.<br/><br/>"But a terrible change came over our stepfather about this time.<br/>Instead of making friends and exchanging visits with our<br/>neighbours, who had at first been overjoyed to see a Roylott of<br/>Stoke Moran back in the old family seat, he shut himself up in his<br/>house and seldom came out save to indulge in ferocious quarrels<br/>with whoever might cross his path. Violence of temper approaching<br/>to mania has been hereditary in the men of the family, and in my<br/>stepfather's case it had, I believe, been intensified by his long<br/>residence in the tropics. A series of disgraceful brawls took<br/>place, two of which ended in the police-court, until at last he<br/>became the terror of the village, and the folks would fly at his<br/>approach, for he is a man of immense strength, and absolutely<br/>uncontrollable in his anger.<br/><br/>"Last week he hurled the local blacksmith over a parapet into a<br/>stream, and it was only by paying over all the money which I could<br/>gather together that I was able to avert another public exposure.<br/>He had no friends at all save the wandering gipsies, and he would<br/>give these vagabonds leave to encamp upon the few acres of<br/>bramble-covered land which represent the family estate, and would<br/>accept in return the hospitality of their tents, wandering away<br/>with them sometimes for weeks on end. He has a passion also for<br/>Indian animals, which are sent over to him by a correspondent, and<br/>he has at this moment a cheetah and a baboon, which wander freely<br/>over his grounds and are feared by the villagers almost as much as<br/>their master.<br/><br/>"You can imagine from what I say that my poor sister Julia and I<br/>had no great pleasure in our lives. No servant would stay with us,<br/>and for a long time we did all the work of the house. She was but<br/>thirty at the time of her death, and yet her hair had already begun<br/>to whiten, even as mine has."<br/><br/>"Your sister is dead, then?"<br/><br/>"She died just two years ago, and it is of her death that I wish<br/>to speak to you. You can understand that, living the life which I<br/>have described, we were little likely to see anyone of our own age<br/>and position. We had, however, an aunt, my mother's maiden sister,<br/>Miss Honoria Westphail, who lives near Harrow, and we were<br/>occasionally allowed to pay short visits at this lady's house.<br/>Julia went there at Christmas two years ago, and met there a<br/>half-pay major of marines, to whom she became engaged. My<br/>stepfather learned of the engagement when my sister returned and<br/>offered no objection to the marriage; but within a fortnight of the<br/>day which had been fixed for the wedding, the terrible event<br/>occurred which has deprived me of my only companion."<br/><br/>Sherlock Holmes had been leaning back in his chair with his eyes<br/>closed and his head sunk in a cushion, but he half opened his lids<br/>now and glanced across at his visitor.<br/>
