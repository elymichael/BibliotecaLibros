<br/>"Ha! this may save us a visit to Brixton Road," whispered<br/>Holmes. "Come with me, and we will see what is to be made of this<br/>fellow." Striding through the scattered knots of people who lounged<br/>round the flaring stalls, my companion speedily overtook the little<br/>man and touched him upon the shoulder. He sprang round, and I could<br/>see in the gas-light that every vestige of colour had been driven<br/>from his face.<br/><br/>"Who are you, then? What do you want?" he asked in a quavering<br/>voice.<br/><br/>"You will excuse me," said Holmes blandly, "but I could not help<br/>overhearing the questions which you put to the salesman just now. I<br/>think that I could be of assistance to you."<br/><br/>"You? Who are you? How could you know anything of the<br/>matter?"<br/><br/>"My name is Sherlock Holmes. It is my business to know what<br/>other people don't know."<br/><br/>"But you can know nothing of this?"<br/><br/>"Excuse me, I know everything of it. You are endeavouring to<br/>trace some geese which were sold by Mrs. Oakshott, of Brixton Road,<br/>to a salesman named Breckinridge, by him in turn to Mr. Windigate,<br/>of the Alpha, and by him to his club, of which Mr. Henry Baker is a<br/>member."<br/><br/>"Oh, sir, you are the very man whom I have longed to meet,"<br/>cried the little fellow with outstretched hands and quivering<br/>fingers. "I can hardly explain to you how interested I am in this<br/>matter."<br/><br/>Sherlock Holmes hailed a four-wheeler which was passing. "In<br/>that case we had better discuss it in a cosy room rather than in<br/>this wind-swept market-place," said he. "But pray tell me, before<br/>we go farther, who it is that I have the pleasure of<br/>assisting."<br/><br/>The man hesitated for an instant. "My name is John Robinson," he<br/>answered with a sidelong glance.<br/><br/>
