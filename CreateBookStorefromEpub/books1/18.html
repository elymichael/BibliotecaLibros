<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>2<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>At three o'clock precisely I was at Baker Street, but Holmes had<br/>not yet returned. The landlady informed me that he had left the<br/>house shortly after eight o'clock in the morning. I sat down beside<br/>the fire, however, with the intention of awaiting him, however long<br/>he might be. I was already deeply interested in his inquiry, for,<br/>though it was surrounded by none of the grim and strange features<br/>which were associated with the two crimes which I have already<br/>recorded, still, the nature of the case and the exalted station of<br/>his client gave it a character of its own. Indeed, apart from the<br/>nature of the investigation which my friend had on hand, there was<br/>something in his masterly grasp of a situation, and his keen,<br/>incisive reasoning, which made it a pleasure to me to study his<br/>system of work, and to follow the quick, subtle methods by which he<br/>disentangled the most inextricable mysteries. So accustomed was I<br/>to his invariable success that the very possibility of his failing<br/>had ceased to enter into my head.<br/><br/>It was close upon four before the door opened, and a<br/>drunken-looking groom, ill-kempt and side-whiskered, with an<br/>inflamed face and disreputable clothes, walked into the room.<br/>Accustomed as I was to my friend's amazing powers in the use of<br/>disguises, I had to look three times before I was certain that it<br/>was indeed he. With a nod he vanished into the bedroom, whence he<br/>emerged in five minutes tweed-suited and respectable, as of old.<br/>Putting his hands into his pockets, he stretched out his legs in<br/>front of the fire and laughed heartily for some minutes.<br/><br/>"Well, really!" he cried, and then he choked and laughed again<br/>until he was obliged to lie back, limp and helpless, in the<br/>chair.<br/><br/>"What is it?"<br/><br/>"It's quite too funny. I am sure you could never guess how I<br/>employed my morning, or what I ended by doing."<br/><br/>"I can't imagine. I suppose that you have been watching the<br/>habits, and perhaps the house, of Miss Irene Adler."<br/><br/>
