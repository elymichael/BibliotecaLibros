"Well, it is not for me to judge you," said Holmes as the old<br/>man signed the statement which had been drawn out. "I pray that we<br/>may never be exposed to such a temptation."<br/><br/>"I pray not, sir. And what do you intend to do?"<br/><br/>"In view of your health, nothing. You are yourself aware that<br/>you will soon have to answer for your deed at a higher court than<br/>the Assizes. I will keep your confession, and if McCarthy is<br/>condemned I shall be forced to use it. If not, it shall never be<br/>seen by mortal eye; and your secret, whether you be alive or dead,<br/>shall be safe with us."<br/><br/>"Farewell, then," said the old man solemnly. "Your own<br/>deathbeds, when they come, will be the easier for the thought of<br/>the peace which you have given to mine." Tottering and shaking in<br/>all his giant frame, he stumbled slowly from the room.<br/><br/>"God help us!" said Holmes after a long silence. "Why does fate<br/>play such tricks with poor, helpless worms? I never hear of such a<br/>case as this that I do not think of Baxter's words, and say,<br/>'There, but for the grace of God, goes Sherlock Holmes.'"<br/><br/>James McCarthy was acquitted at the Assizes on the strength of a<br/>number of objections which had been drawn out by Holmes and<br/>submitted to the defending counsel. Old Turner lived for seven<br/>months after our interview, but he is now dead; and there is every<br/>prospect that the son and daughter may come to live happily<br/>together in ignorance of the black cloud which rests upon their<br/>past.<br/><br/><br/><br/>
