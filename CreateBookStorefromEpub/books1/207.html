"Yes."<br/><br/>"Did you become engaged then?"<br/><br/>"No."<br/><br/>"But you were on a friendly footing?"<br/><br/>"I was amused by her society, and she could see that I was<br/>amused."<br/><br/>"Her father is very rich?"<br/><br/>"He is said to be the richest man on the Pacific slope."<br/><br/>"And how did he make his money?"<br/><br/>"In mining. He had nothing a few years ago. Then he struck gold,<br/>invested it, and came up by leaps and bounds."<br/><br/>"Now, what is your own impression as to the young lady's—your<br/>wife's character?"<br/><br/>The nobleman swung his glasses a little faster and stared down<br/>into the fire. "You see, Mr. Holmes," said he, "my wife was twenty<br/>before her father became a rich man. During that time she ran free<br/>in a mining camp and wandered through woods or mountains, so that<br/>her education has come from Nature rather than from the<br/>schoolmaster. She is what we call in England a tomboy, with a<br/>strong nature, wild and free, unfettered by any sort of traditions.<br/>She is impetuous—volcanic, I was about to say. She is swift in<br/>making up her mind and fearless in carrying out her resolutions. On<br/>the other hand, I would not have given her the name which I have<br/>the honour to bear"—he gave a little stately cough—"had not I<br/>thought her to be at bottom a noble woman. I believe that she is<br/>capable of heroic self-sacrifice and that anything dishonourable<br/>would be repugnant to her."<br/>
