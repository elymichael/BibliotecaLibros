<br/>"Nor from below," said Mr. Merryweather, striking his stick upon<br/>the flags which lined the floor. "Why, dear me, it sounds quite<br/>hollow!" he remarked, looking up in surprise.<br/><br/>"I must really ask you to be a little more quiet!" said Holmes<br/>severely. "You have already imperilled the whole success of our<br/>expedition. Might I beg that you would have the goodness to sit<br/>down upon one of those boxes, and not to interfere?"<br/><br/>The solemn Mr. Merryweather perched himself upon a crate, with a<br/>very injured expression upon his face, while Holmes fell upon his<br/>knees upon the floor and, with the lantern and a magnifying lens,<br/>began to examine minutely the cracks between the stones. A few<br/>seconds sufficed to satisfy him, for he sprang to his feet again<br/>and put his glass in his pocket.<br/><br/>"We have at least an hour before us," he remarked, "for they can<br/>hardly take any steps until the good pawnbroker is safely in bed.<br/>Then they will not lose a minute, for the sooner they do their work<br/>the longer time they will have for their escape. We are at present,<br/>Doctor—as no doubt you have divined—in the cellar of the City<br/>branch of one of the principal London banks. Mr. Merryweather is<br/>the chairman of directors, and he will explain to you that there<br/>are reasons why the more daring criminals of London should take a<br/>considerable interest in this cellar at present."<br/><br/>"It is our French gold," whispered the director. "We have had<br/>several warnings that an attempt might be made upon it."<br/><br/>"Your French gold?"<br/><br/>"Yes. We had occasion some months ago to strengthen our<br/>resources and borrowed for that purpose 30,000 napoleons from the<br/>Bank of France. It has become known that we have never had occasion<br/>to unpack the money, and that it is still lying in our cellar. The<br/>crate upon which I sit contains 2,000 napoleons packed between<br/>layers of lead foil. Our reserve of bullion is much larger at<br/>present than is usually kept in a single branch office, and the<br/>directors have had misgivings upon the subject."<br/><br/>"Which were very well justified," observed Holmes. "And now it<br/>is time that we arranged our little plans. I expect that within an<br/>hour matters will come to a head. In the meantime Mr. Merryweather,<br/>we must put the screen over that dark lantern."<br/><br/>"And sit in the dark?"<br/><br/>"I am afraid so. I had brought a pack of cards in my pocket, and<br/>I thought that, as we were a partie carrée, you might have your<br/>rubber after all. But I see that the enemy's preparations have gone<br/>so far that we cannot risk the presence of a light. And, first of<br/>all, we must choose our positions. These are daring men, and though<br/>we shall take them at a disadvantage, they may do us some harm<br/>unless we are careful. I shall stand behind this crate, and do you<br/>conceal yourselves behind those. Then, when I flash a light upon<br/>them, close in swiftly. If they fire, Watson, have no compunction<br/>about shooting them down."<br/><br/>
