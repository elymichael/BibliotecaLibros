"Now, Mr. Holmes, you know the people who live under my roof,<br/>and I shall continue with my miserable story.<br/><br/>"When we were taking coffee in the drawing-room that night after<br/>dinner, I told Arthur and Mary my experience, and of the precious<br/>treasure which we had under our roof, suppressing only the name of<br/>my client. Lucy Parr, who had brought in the coffee, had, I am<br/>sure, left the room; but I cannot swear that the door was closed.<br/>Mary and Arthur were much interested and wished to see the famous<br/>coronet, but I thought it better not to disturb it.<br/><br/>"'Where have you put it?' asked Arthur.<br/><br/>"'In my own bureau.'<br/><br/>"'Well, I hope to goodness the house won't be burgled during the<br/>night.' said he.<br/><br/>"'It is locked up,' I answered.<br/><br/>"'Oh, any old key will fit that bureau. When I was a youngster I<br/>have opened it myself with the key of the box-room cupboard.'<br/><br/>"He often had a wild way of talking, so that I thought little of<br/>what he said. He followed me to my room, however, that night with a<br/>very grave face.<br/><br/>"'Look here, dad,' said he with his eyes cast down, 'can you let<br/>me have 200 pounds?'<br/><br/>"'No, I cannot!' I answered sharply. 'I have been far too<br/>generous with you in money matters.'<br/><br/>"'You have been very kind,' said he, 'but I must have this<br/>money, or else I can never show my face inside the club again.'<br/>
