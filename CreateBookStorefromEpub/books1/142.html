<br/>"Well, then, do you imagine that this other one, Henry Baker,<br/>had anything to do with the matter?"<br/><br/>"It is, I think, much more likely that Henry Baker is an<br/>absolutely innocent man, who had no idea that the bird which he was<br/>carrying was of considerably more value than if it were made of<br/>solid gold. That, however, I shall determine by a very simple test<br/>if we have an answer to our advertisement."<br/><br/>"And you can do nothing until then?"<br/><br/>"Nothing."<br/><br/>"In that case I shall continue my professional round. But I<br/>shall come back in the evening at the hour you have mentioned, for<br/>I should like to see the solution of so tangled a business."<br/><br/>"Very glad to see you. I dine at seven. There is a woodcock, I<br/>believe. By the way, in view of recent occurrences, perhaps I ought<br/>to ask Mrs. Hudson to examine its crop."<br/><br/>I had been delayed at a case, and it was a little after<br/>half-past six when I found myself in Baker Street once more. As I<br/>approached the house I saw a tall man in a Scotch bonnet with a<br/>coat which was buttoned up to his chin waiting outside in the<br/>bright semicircle which was thrown from the fanlight. Just as I<br/>arrived the door was opened, and we were shown up together to<br/>Holmes' room.<br/><br/>"Mr. Henry Baker, I believe," said he, rising from his armchair<br/>and greeting his visitor with the easy air of geniality which he<br/>could so readily assume. "Pray take this chair by the fire, Mr.<br/>Baker. It is a cold night, and I observe that your circulation is<br/>more adapted for summer than for winter. Ah, Watson, you have just<br/>come at the right time. Is that your hat, Mr. Baker?"<br/><br/>"Yes, sir, that is undoubtedly my hat."<br/><br/>He was a large man with rounded shoulders, a massive head, and a<br/>broad, intelligent face, sloping down to a pointed beard of<br/>grizzled brown. A touch of red in nose and cheeks, with a slight<br/>tremor of his extended hand, recalled Holmes' surmise as to his<br/>habits. His rusty black frock-coat was buttoned right up in front,<br/>with the collar turned up, and his lank wrists protruded from his<br/>sleeves without a sign of cuff or shirt. He spoke in a slow<br/>staccato fashion, choosing his words with care, and gave the<br/>impression generally of a man of learning and letters who had had<br/>ill-usage at the hands of fortune.<br/><br/>
