"It is a noiseless lock," said he. "It is no wonder that it did<br/>not wake you. This case, I presume, contains the coronet. We must<br/>have a look at it." He opened the case, and taking out the diadem<br/>he laid it upon the table. It was a magnificent specimen of the<br/>jeweller's art, and the thirty-six stones were the finest that I<br/>have ever seen. At one side of the coronet was a cracked edge,<br/>where a corner holding three gems had been torn away.<br/><br/>"Now, Mr. Holder," said Holmes, "here is the corner which<br/>corresponds to that which has been so unfortunately lost. Might I<br/>beg that you will break it off."<br/><br/>The banker recoiled in horror. "I should not dream of trying,"<br/>said he.<br/><br/>"Then I will." Holmes suddenly bent his strength upon it, but<br/>without result. "I feel it give a little," said he; "but, though I<br/>am exceptionally strong in the fingers, it would take me all my<br/>time to break it. An ordinary man could not do it. Now, what do you<br/>think would happen if I did break it, Mr. Holder? There would be a<br/>noise like a pistol shot. Do you tell me that all this happened<br/>within a few yards of your bed and that you heard nothing of<br/>it?"<br/><br/>"I do not know what to think. It is all dark to me."<br/><br/>"But perhaps it may grow lighter as we go. What do you think,<br/>Miss Holder?"<br/><br/>"I confess that I still share my uncle's perplexity."<br/><br/>"Your son had no shoes or slippers on when you saw him?"<br/><br/>"He had nothing on save only his trousers and shirt."<br/><br/>"Thank you. We have certainly been favoured with extraordinary<br/>luck during this inquiry, and it will be entirely our own fault if<br/>we do not succeed in clearing the matter up. With your permission,<br/>Mr. Holder, I shall now continue my investigations outside."<br/><br/>He went alone, at his own request, for he explained that any<br/>unnecessary footmarks might make his task more difficult. For an<br/>hour or more he was at work, returning at last with his feet heavy<br/>with snow and his features as inscrutable as ever.<br/>
