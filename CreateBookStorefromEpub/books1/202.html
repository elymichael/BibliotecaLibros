<br/>"My dear fellow, I congratulate you."<br/><br/>"I assure you, Watson, without affectation, that the status of<br/>my client is a matter of less moment to me than the interest of his<br/>case. It is just possible, however, that that also may not be<br/>wanting in this new investigation. You have been reading the papers<br/>diligently of late, have you not?"<br/><br/>"It looks like it," said I ruefully, pointing to a huge bundle<br/>in the corner. "I have had nothing else to do."<br/><br/>"It is fortunate, for you will perhaps be able to post me up. I<br/>read nothing except the criminal news and the agony column. The<br/>latter is always instructive. But if you have followed recent<br/>events so closely you must have read about Lord St. Simon and his<br/>wedding?"<br/><br/>"Oh, yes, with the deepest interest."<br/><br/>"That is well. The letter which I hold in my hand is from Lord<br/>St. Simon. I will read it to you, and in return you must turn over<br/>these papers and let me have whatever bears upon the matter. This<br/>is what he says:<br/><br/>"'MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES:â€”Lord Backwater tells me that I<br/>may place implicit reliance upon your judgment and discretion. I<br/>have determined, therefore, to call upon you and to consult you in<br/>reference to the very painful event which has occurred in<br/>connection with my wedding. Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, is<br/>acting already in the matter, but he assures me that he sees no<br/>objection to your co-operation, and that he even thinks that it<br/>might be of some assistance. I will call at four o'clock in the<br/>afternoon, and, should you have any other engagement at that time,<br/>I hope that you will postpone it, as this matter is of paramount<br/>importance. Yours faithfully, ST. SIMON.'<br/><br/>"It is dated from Grosvenor Mansions, written with a quill pen,<br/>and the noble lord has had the misfortune to get a smear of ink<br/>upon the outer side of his right little finger," remarked Holmes as<br/>he folded up the epistle.<br/><br/>"He says four o'clock. It is three now. He will be here in an<br/>hour."<br/><br/>"Then I have just time, with your assistance, to get clear upon<br/>the subject. Turn over those papers and arrange the extracts in<br/>their order of time, while I take a glance as to who our client<br/>is." He picked a red-covered volume from a line of books of<br/>reference beside the mantelpiece. "Here he is," said he, sitting<br/>down and flattening it out upon his knee. "'Lord Robert Walsingham<br/>de Vere St. Simon, second son of the Duke of Balmoral.' Hum! 'Arms:<br/>Azure, three caltrops in chief over a fess sable. Born in 1846.'<br/>He's forty-one years of age, which is mature for marriage. Was<br/>Under-Secretary for the colonies in a late administration. The<br/>Duke, his father, was at one time Secretary for Foreign Affairs.<br/>They inherit Plantagenet blood by direct descent, and Tudor on the<br/>distaff side. Ha! Well, there is nothing very instructive in all<br/>this. I think that I must turn to you Watson, for something more<br/>solid."<br/><br/>
