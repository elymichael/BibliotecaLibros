Ryder passed his tongue over his parched lips. "I will tell you
it just as it happened, sir," said he. "When Horner had been
arrested, it seemed to me that it would be best for me to get away
with the stone at once, for I did not know at what moment the
police might not take it into their heads to search me and my room.
There was no place about the hotel where it would be safe. I went
out, as if on some commission, and I made for my sister's house.
She had married a man named Oakshott, and lived in Brixton Road,
where she fattened fowls for the market. All the way there every
man I met seemed to me to be a policeman or a detective; and, for
all that it was a cold night, the sweat was pouring down my face
before I came to the Brixton Road. My sister asked me what was the
matter, and why I was so pale; but I told her that I had been upset
by the jewel robbery at the hotel. Then I went into the back yard
and smoked a pipe and wondered what it would be best to do.

"I had a friend once called Maudsley, who went to the bad, and
has just been serving his time in Pentonville. One day he had met
me, and fell into talk about the ways of thieves, and how they
could get rid of what they stole. I knew that he would be true to
me, for I knew one or two things about him; so I made up my mind to
go right on to Kilburn, where he lived, and take him into my
confidence. He would show me how to turn the stone into money. But
how to get to him in safety? I thought of the agonies I had gone
through in coming from the hotel. I might at any moment be seized
and searched, and there would be the stone in my waistcoat pocket.
I was leaning against the wall at the time and looking at the geese
which were waddling about round my feet, and suddenly an idea came
into my head which showed me how I could beat the best detective
that ever lived.

"My sister had told me some weeks before that I might have the
pick of her geese for a Christmas present, and I knew that she was
always as good as her word. I would take my goose now, and in it I
would carry my stone to Kilburn. There was a little shed in the
yard, and behind this I drove one of the birds—a fine big one,
white, with a barred tail. I caught it, and prying its bill open, I
thrust the stone down its throat as far as my finger could reach.
The bird gave a gulp, and I felt the stone pass along its gullet
and down into its crop. But the creature flapped and struggled, and
out came my sister to know what was the matter. As I turned to
speak to her the brute broke loose and fluttered off among the
others.

"'Whatever were you doing with that bird, Jem?' says she.

"'Well,' said I, 'you said you'd give me one for Christmas, and
I was feeling which was the fattest.'

"'Oh,' says she, 'we've set yours aside for you—Jem's bird, we
call it. It's the big white one over yonder. There's twenty-six of
them, which makes one for you, and one for us, and two dozen for
the market.'

"'Thank you, Maggie,' says I; 'but if it is all the same to you,
I'd rather have that one I was handling just now.'

"'The other is a good three pound heavier,' said she, 'and we
fattened it expressly for you.'

"'Never mind. I'll have the other, and I'll take it now,' said
I.

"'Oh, just as you like,' said she, a little huffed. 'Which is it
you want, then?'

"'That white one with the barred tail, right in the middle of
the flock.'
