<br/><br/><br/>When I glance over my notes and records of the Sherlock Holmes<br/>cases between the years '82 and '90, I am faced by so many which<br/>present strange and interesting features that it is no easy matter<br/>to know which to choose and which to leave. Some, however, have<br/>already gained publicity through the papers, and others have not<br/>offered a field for those peculiar qualities which my friend<br/>possessed in so high a degree, and which it is the object of these<br/>papers to illustrate. Some, too, have baffled his analytical skill,<br/>and would be, as narratives, beginnings without an ending, while<br/>others have been but partially cleared up, and have their<br/>explanations founded rather upon conjecture and surmise than on<br/>that absolute logical proof which was so dear to him. There is,<br/>however, one of these last which was so remarkable in its details<br/>and so startling in its results that I am tempted to give some<br/>account of it in spite of the fact that there are points in<br/>connection with it which never have been, and probably never will<br/>be, entirely cleared up.<br/><br/>The year '87 furnished us with a long series of cases of greater<br/>or less interest, of which I retain the records. Among my headings<br/>under this one twelve months I find an account of the adventure of<br/>the Paradol Chamber, of the Amateur Mendicant Society, who held a<br/>luxurious club in the lower vault of a furniture warehouse, of the<br/>facts connected with the loss of the British barque "Sophy<br/>Anderson", of the singular adventures of the Grice Patersons in the<br/>island of Uffa, and finally of the Camberwell poisoning case. In<br/>the latter, as may be remembered, Sherlock Holmes was able, by<br/>winding up the dead man's watch, to prove that it had been wound up<br/>two hours before, and that therefore the deceased had gone to bed<br/>within that timeâ€”a deduction which was of the greatest importance<br/>in clearing up the case. All these I may sketch out at some future<br/>date, but none of them present such singular features as the<br/>strange train of circumstances which I have now taken up my pen to<br/>describe.<br/><br/>It was in the latter days of September, and the equinoctial<br/>gales had set in with exceptional violence. All day the wind had<br/>screamed and the rain had beaten against the windows, so that even<br/>here in the heart of great, hand-made London we were forced to<br/>raise our minds for the instant from the routine of life and to<br/>recognise the presence of those great elemental forces which shriek<br/>at mankind through the bars of his civilisation, like untamed<br/>beasts in a cage. As evening drew in, the storm grew higher and<br/>louder, and the wind cried and sobbed like a child in the chimney.<br/>Sherlock Holmes sat moodily at one side of the fireplace<br/>cross-indexing his records of crime, while I at the other was deep<br/>in one of Clark Russell's fine sea-stories until the howl of the<br/>gale from without seemed to blend with the text, and the splash of<br/>the rain to lengthen out into the long swash of the sea waves. My<br/>wife was on a visit to her mother's, and for a few days I was a<br/>dweller once more in my old quarters at Baker Street.<br/><br/>"Why," said I, glancing up at my companion, "that was surely the<br/>bell. Who could come to-night? Some friend of yours, perhaps?"<br/><br/>"Except yourself I have none," he answered. "I do not encourage<br/>visitors."<br/><br/>"A client, then?"<br/><br/>"If so, it is a serious case. Nothing less would bring a man out<br/>on such a day and at such an hour. But I take it that it is more<br/>likely to be some crony of the landlady's."<br/><br/>Sherlock Holmes was wrong in his conjecture, however, for there<br/>came a step in the passage and a tapping at the door. He stretched<br/>out his long arm to turn the lamp away from himself and towards the<br/>vacant chair upon which a newcomer must sit.<br/><br/>"Come in!" said he.<br/><br/>The man who entered was young, some two-and-twenty at the<br/>outside, well-groomed and trimly clad, with something of refinement<br/>and delicacy in his bearing. The streaming umbrella which he held<br/>in his hand, and his long shining waterproof told of the fierce<br/>weather through which he had come. He looked about him anxiously in<br/>the glare of the lamp, and I could see that his face was pale and<br/>his eyes heavy, like those of a man who is weighed down with some<br/>great anxiety.<br/>
