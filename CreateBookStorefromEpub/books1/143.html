"We have retained these things for some days," said Holmes,<br/>"because we expected to see an advertisement from you giving your<br/>address. I am at a loss to know now why you did not advertise."<br/><br/>Our visitor gave a rather shamefaced laugh. "Shillings have not<br/>been so plentiful with me as they once were," he remarked. "I had<br/>no doubt that the gang of roughs who assaulted me had carried off<br/>both my hat and the bird. I did not care to spend more money in a<br/>hopeless attempt at recovering them."<br/><br/>"Very naturally. By the way, about the bird, we were compelled<br/>to eat it."<br/><br/>"To eat it!" Our visitor half rose from his chair in his<br/>excitement.<br/><br/>"Yes, it would have been of no use to anyone had we not done so.<br/>But I presume that this other goose upon the sideboard, which is<br/>about the same weight and perfectly fresh, will answer your purpose<br/>equally well?"<br/><br/>"Oh, certainly, certainly," answered Mr. Baker with a sigh of<br/>relief.<br/><br/>"Of course, we still have the feathers, legs, crop, and so on of<br/>your own bird, so if you wish—"<br/><br/>The man burst into a hearty laugh. "They might be useful to me<br/>as relics of my adventure," said he, "but beyond that I can hardly<br/>see what use the disjecta membra of my late acquaintance are going<br/>to be to me. No, sir, I think that, with your permission, I will<br/>confine my attentions to the excellent bird which I perceive upon<br/>the sideboard."<br/><br/>Sherlock Holmes glanced sharply across at me with a slight shrug<br/>of his shoulders.<br/><br/>"There is your hat, then, and there your bird," said he. "By the<br/>way, would it bore you to tell me where you got the other one from?<br/>I am somewhat of a fowl fancier, and I have seldom seen a better<br/>grown goose."<br/><br/>"Certainly, sir," said Baker, who had risen and tucked his newly<br/>gained property under his arm. "There are a few of us who frequent<br/>the Alpha Inn, near the Museum—we are to be found in the Museum<br/>itself during the day, you understand. This year our good host,<br/>Windigate by name, instituted a goose club, by which, on<br/>consideration of some few pence every week, we were each to receive<br/>a bird at Christmas. My pence were duly paid, and the rest is<br/>familiar to you. I am much indebted to you, sir, for a Scotch<br/>bonnet is fitted neither to my years nor my gravity." With a<br/>comical pomposity of manner he bowed solemnly to both of us and<br/>strode off upon his way.<br/>
