<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>3<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>I slept at Baker Street that night, and we were engaged upon our<br/>toast and coffee in the morning when the King of Bohemia rushed<br/>into the room.<br/><br/>"You have really got it!" he cried, grasping Sherlock Holmes by<br/>either shoulder and looking eagerly into his face.<br/><br/>"Not yet."<br/><br/>"But you have hopes?"<br/><br/>"I have hopes."<br/><br/>"Then, come. I am all impatience to be gone."<br/><br/>
