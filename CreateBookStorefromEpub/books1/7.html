"Indeed, I should have thought a little more. Just a trifle<br/>more, I fancy, Watson. And in practice again, I observe. You did<br/>not tell me that you intended to go into harness."<br/><br/>"Then, how do you know?"<br/><br/>"I see it, I deduce it. How do I know that you have been getting<br/>yourself very wet lately, and that you have a most clumsy and<br/>careless servant girl?"<br/><br/>"My dear Holmes," said I, "this is too much. You would certainly<br/>have been burned, had you lived a few centuries ago. It is true<br/>that I had a country walk on Thursday and came home in a dreadful<br/>mess, but as I have changed my clothes I can't imagine how you<br/>deduce it. As to Mary Jane, she is incorrigible, and my wife has<br/>given her notice, but there, again, I fail to see how you work it<br/>out."<br/><br/>He chuckled to himself and rubbed his long, nervous hands<br/>together.<br/><br/>"It is simplicity itself," said he; "my eyes tell me that on the<br/>inside of your left shoe, just where the firelight strikes it, the<br/>leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts. Obviously they have<br/>been caused by someone who has very carelessly scraped round the<br/>edges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud from it. Hence,<br/>you see, my double deduction that you had been out in vile weather,<br/>and that you had a particularly malignant boot-slitting specimen of<br/>the London slavey. As to your practice, if a gentleman walks into<br/>my rooms smelling of iodoform, with a black mark of nitrate of<br/>silver upon his right forefinger, and a bulge on the right side of<br/>his top-hat to show where he has secreted his stethoscope, I must<br/>be dull, indeed, if I do not pronounce him to be an active member<br/>of the medical profession."<br/><br/>I could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained<br/>his process of deduction. "When I hear you give your reasons," I<br/>remarked, "the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously<br/>simple that I could easily do it myself, though at each successive<br/>instance of your reasoning I am baffled until you explain your<br/>process. And yet I believe that my eyes are as good as yours."<br/><br/>"Quite so," he answered, lighting a cigarette, and throwing<br/>himself down into an armchair. "You see, but you do not observe.<br/>The distinction is clear. For example, you have frequently seen the<br/>steps which lead up from the hall to this room."<br/><br/>"Frequently."<br/><br/>"How often?"<br/><br/>"Well, some hundreds of times."<br/>
