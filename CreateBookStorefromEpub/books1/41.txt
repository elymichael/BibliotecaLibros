"'Well, you have to be in the office, or at least in the
building, the whole time. If you leave, you forfeit your whole

nor business nor anything else. There you must stay, or you lose

first volume of it in that press. You must find your own ink, pens,
and blotting-paper, but we provide this table and chair. Will you
be ready to-morrow?'
