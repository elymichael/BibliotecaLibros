<br/>"It certainly sounds feasible."<br/><br/>"Well, we will take it as a working hypothesis for want of a<br/>better. Boone, as I have told you, was arrested and taken to the<br/>station, but it could not be shown that there had ever before been<br/>anything against him. He had for years been known as a professional<br/>beggar, but his life appeared to have been a very quiet and<br/>innocent one. There the matter stands at present, and the questions<br/>which have to be solved—what Neville St. Clair was doing in the<br/>opium den, what happened to him when there, where is he now, and<br/>what Hugh Boone had to do with his disappearance—are all as far<br/>from a solution as ever. I confess that I cannot recall any case<br/>within my experience which looked at the first glance so simple and<br/>yet which presented such difficulties."<br/><br/>While Sherlock Holmes had been detailing this singular series of<br/>events, we had been whirling through the outskirts of the great<br/>town until the last straggling houses had been left behind, and we<br/>rattled along with a country hedge upon either side of us. Just as<br/>he finished, however, we drove through two scattered villages,<br/>where a few lights still glimmered in the windows.<br/><br/>"We are on the outskirts of Lee," said my companion. "We have<br/>touched on three English counties in our short drive, starting in<br/>Middlesex, passing over an angle of Surrey, and ending in Kent. See<br/>that light among the trees? That is The Cedars, and beside that<br/>lamp sits a woman whose anxious ears have already, I have little<br/>doubt, caught the clink of our horse's feet."<br/><br/>"But why are you not conducting the case from Baker Street?" I<br/>asked.<br/><br/>"Because there are many inquiries which must be made out here.<br/>Mrs. St. Clair has most kindly put two rooms at my disposal, and<br/>you may rest assured that she will have nothing but a welcome for<br/>my friend and colleague. I hate to meet her, Watson, when I have no<br/>news of her husband. Here we are. Whoa, there, whoa!"<br/><br/>We had pulled up in front of a large villa which stood within<br/>its own grounds. A stable-boy had run out to the horse's head, and<br/>springing down, I followed Holmes up the small, winding<br/>gravel-drive which led to the house. As we approached, the door<br/>flew open, and a little blonde woman stood in the opening, clad in<br/>some sort of light mousseline de soie, with a touch of fluffy pink<br/>chiffon at her neck and wrists. She stood with her figure outlined<br/>against the flood of light, one hand upon the door, one half-raised<br/>in her eagerness, her body slightly bent, her head and face<br/>protruded, with eager eyes and parted lips, a standing<br/>question.<br/><br/>"Well?" she cried, "well?" And then, seeing that there were two<br/>of us, she gave a cry of hope which sank into a groan as she saw<br/>that my companion shook his head and shrugged his shoulders.<br/><br/>"No good news?"<br/><br/>"None."<br/><br/>
