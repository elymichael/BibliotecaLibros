<br/>"Then pray send him home in it. You may safely trust him, for he<br/>appears to be too limp to get into any mischief. I should recommend<br/>you also to send a note by the cabman to your wife to say that you<br/>have thrown in your lot with me. If you will wait outside, I shall<br/>be with you in five minutes."<br/><br/>It was difficult to refuse any of Sherlock Holmes' requests, for<br/>they were always so exceedingly definite, and put forward with such<br/>a quiet air of mastery. I felt, however, that when Whitney was once<br/>confined in the cab my mission was practically accomplished; and<br/>for the rest, I could not wish anything better than to be<br/>associated with my friend in one of those singular adventures which<br/>were the normal condition of his existence. In a few minutes I had<br/>written my note, paid Whitney's bill, led him out to the cab, and<br/>seen him driven through the darkness. In a very short time a<br/>decrepit figure had emerged from the opium den, and I was walking<br/>down the street with Sherlock Holmes. For two streets he shuffled<br/>along with a bent back and an uncertain foot. Then, glancing<br/>quickly round, he straightened himself out and burst into a hearty<br/>fit of laughter.<br/><br/>"I suppose, Watson," said he, "that you imagine that I have<br/>added opium-smoking to cocaine injections, and all the other little<br/>weaknesses on which you have favoured me with your medical<br/>views."<br/><br/>"I was certainly surprised to find you there."<br/><br/>"But not more so than I to find you."<br/><br/>"I came to find a friend."<br/><br/>"And I to find an enemy."<br/><br/>"An enemy?"<br/><br/>"Yes; one of my natural enemies, or, shall I say, my natural<br/>prey. Briefly, Watson, I am in the midst of a very remarkable<br/>inquiry, and I have hoped to find a clue in the incoherent<br/>ramblings of these sots, as I have done before now. Had I been<br/>recognised in that den my life would not have been worth an hour's<br/>purchase; for I have used it before now for my own purposes, and<br/>the rascally Lascar who runs it has sworn to have vengeance upon<br/>me. There is a trap-door at the back of that building, near the<br/>corner of Paul's Wharf, which could tell some strange tales of what<br/>has passed through it upon the moonless nights."<br/><br/>"What! You do not mean bodies?"<br/><br/>
