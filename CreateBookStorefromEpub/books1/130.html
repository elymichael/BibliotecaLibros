"He's a beauty, isn't he?" said the inspector.<br/><br/>"He certainly needs a wash," remarked Holmes. "I had an idea<br/>that he might, and I took the liberty of bringing the tools with<br/>me." He opened the Gladstone bag as he spoke, and took out, to my<br/>astonishment, a very large bath-sponge.<br/><br/>"He! he! You are a funny one," chuckled the inspector.<br/><br/>"Now, if you will have the great goodness to open that door very<br/>quietly, we will soon make him cut a much more respectable<br/>figure."<br/><br/>"Well, I don't know why not," said the inspector. "He doesn't<br/>look a credit to the Bow Street cells, does he?" He slipped his key<br/>into the lock, and we all very quietly entered the cell. The<br/>sleeper half turned, and then settled down once more into a deep<br/>slumber. Holmes stooped to the water-jug, moistened his sponge, and<br/>then rubbed it twice vigorously across and down the prisoner's<br/>face.<br/><br/>"Let me introduce you," he shouted, "to Mr. Neville St. Clair,<br/>of Lee, in the county of Kent."<br/><br/>Never in my life have I seen such a sight. The man's face peeled<br/>off under the sponge like the bark from a tree. Gone was the coarse<br/>brown tint! Gone, too, was the horrid scar which had seamed it<br/>across, and the twisted lip which had given the repulsive sneer to<br/>the face! A twitch brought away the tangled red hair, and there,<br/>sitting up in his bed, was a pale, sad-faced, refined-looking man,<br/>black-haired and smooth-skinned, rubbing his eyes and staring about<br/>him with sleepy bewilderment. Then suddenly realising the exposure,<br/>he broke into a scream and threw himself down with his face to the<br/>pillow.<br/><br/>"Great heavens!" cried the inspector, "it is, indeed, the<br/>missing man. I know him from the photograph."<br/><br/>The prisoner turned with the reckless air of a man who abandons<br/>himself to his destiny. "Be it so," said he. "And pray what am I<br/>charged with?"<br/><br/>"With making away with Mr. Neville St.â€” Oh, come, you can't be<br/>charged with that unless they make a case of attempted suicide of<br/>it," said the inspector with a grin. "Well, I have been<br/>twenty-seven years in the force, but this really takes the<br/>cake."<br/><br/>"If I am Mr. Neville St. Clair, then it is obvious that no crime<br/>has been committed, and that, therefore, I am illegally<br/>detained."<br/>
