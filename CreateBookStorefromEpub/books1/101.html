"I did not know. It was only to-day that I spoke to Major<br/>Prendergast about my troubles and was advised by him to come to<br/>you."<br/><br/>"It is really two days since you had the letter. We should have<br/>acted before this. You have no further evidence, I suppose, than<br/>that which you have placed before usâ€”no suggestive detail which<br/>might help us?"<br/><br/>"There is one thing," said John Openshaw. He rummaged in his<br/>coat pocket, and, drawing out a piece of discoloured, blue-tinted<br/>paper, he laid it out upon the table. "I have some remembrance,"<br/>said he, "that on the day when my uncle burned the papers I<br/>observed that the small, unburned margins which lay amid the ashes<br/>were of this particular colour. I found this single sheet upon the<br/>floor of his room, and I am inclined to think that it may be one of<br/>the papers which has, perhaps, fluttered out from among the others,<br/>and in that way has escaped destruction. Beyond the mention of<br/>pips, I do not see that it helps us much. I think myself that it is<br/>a page from some private diary. The writing is undoubtedly my<br/>uncle's."<br/><br/>Holmes moved the lamp, and we both bent over the sheet of paper,<br/>which showed by its ragged edge that it had indeed been torn from a<br/>book. It was headed, "March, 1869," and beneath were the following<br/>enigmatical notices:<br/><br/>"4th. Hudson came. Same old platform.<br/><br/>"7th. Set the pips on McCauley, Paramore, and John Swain, of St.<br/>Augustine.<br/><br/>"9th. McCauley cleared.<br/><br/>"10th. John Swain cleared.<br/><br/>"12th. Visited Paramore. All well."<br/><br/>"Thank you!" said Holmes, folding up the paper and returning it<br/>to our visitor. "And now you must on no account lose another<br/>instant. We cannot spare time even to discuss what you have told<br/>me. You must get home instantly and act."<br/><br/>"What shall I do?"<br/>
