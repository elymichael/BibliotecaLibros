"Well, Miss Hunter, if your mind is made up, that settles the<br/>question," said Holmes, smiling.<br/><br/>"But you would not advise me to refuse?"<br/><br/>"I confess that it is not the situation which I should like to<br/>see a sister of mine apply for."<br/><br/>"What is the meaning of it all, Mr. Holmes?"<br/><br/>"Ah, I have no data.
