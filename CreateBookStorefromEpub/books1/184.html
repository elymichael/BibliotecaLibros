"And now, Doctor, perhaps you would<br/>kindly attend to my thumb, or rather to the place where my thumb<br/>used to be."<br/><br/>He unwound the handkerchief and held out his hand. It gave even<br/>my hardened nerves a shudder to look at it. There were four<br/>protruding fingers and a horrid red, spongy surface where the thumb<br/>should have been.

I fainted when it was done, and I think that I<br/>must have been senseless for a long time. When I came to I found<br/>that it was still bleeding, so I tied one end of my handkerchief<br/>very tightly round the wrist and braced it up with a twig."<br/><br/>"Excellent! You should have been a surgeon."<br/><br/>"It is a question of hydraulics, you see, and came within my own<br/>province."<br/><br/>
