<br/>"I think that I have seen now all that there is to see, Mr.<br/>Holder," said he; "I can serve you best by returning to my<br/>rooms."<br/><br/>"But the gems, Mr. Holmes. Where are they?"<br/><br/>"I cannot tell."<br/><br/>The banker wrung his hands. "I shall never see them again!" he<br/>cried. "And my son? You give me hopes?"<br/><br/>"My opinion is in no way altered."<br/><br/>"Then, for God's sake, what was this dark business which was<br/>acted in my house last night?"<br/><br/>"If you can call upon me at my Baker Street rooms to-morrow<br/>morning between nine and ten I shall be happy to do what I can to<br/>make it clearer. I understand that you give me carte blanche to act<br/>for you, provided only that I get back the gems, and that you place<br/>no limit on the sum I may draw."<br/><br/>"I would give my fortune to have them back."<br/><br/>"Very good. I shall look into the matter between this and then.<br/>Good-bye; it is just possible that I may have to come over here<br/>again before evening."<br/><br/>It was obvious to me that my companion's mind was now made up<br/>about the case, although what his conclusions were was more than I<br/>could even dimly imagine. Several times during our homeward journey<br/>I endeavoured to sound him upon the point, but he always glided<br/>away to some other topic, until at last I gave it over in despair.<br/>It was not yet three when we found ourselves in our rooms once<br/>more. He hurried to his chamber and was down again in a few minutes<br/>dressed as a common loafer. With his collar turned up, his shiny,<br/>seedy coat, his red cravat, and his worn boots, he was a perfect<br/>sample of the class.<br/><br/>
