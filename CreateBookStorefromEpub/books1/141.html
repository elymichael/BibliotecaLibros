"What will you say?"<br/><br/>"Give me a pencil and that slip of paper. Now, then: 'Found at<br/>the corner of Goodge Street, a goose and a black felt hat. Mr.<br/>Henry Baker can have the same by applying at 6:30 this evening at<br/>221B, Baker Street.' That is clear and concise."<br/><br/>"Very. But will he see it?"<br/><br/>"Well, he is sure to keep an eye on the papers, since, to a poor<br/>man, the loss was a heavy one. He was clearly so scared by his<br/>mischance in breaking the window and by the approach of Peterson<br/>that he thought of nothing but flight, but since then he must have<br/>bitterly regretted the impulse which caused him to drop his bird.<br/>Then, again, the introduction of his name will cause him to see it,<br/>for everyone who knows him will direct his attention to it. Here<br/>you are, Peterson, run down to the advertising agency and have this<br/>put in the evening papers."<br/><br/>"In which, sir?"<br/><br/>"Oh, in the Globe, Star, Pall Mall, St. James's, Evening News,<br/>Standard, Echo, and any others that occur to you."<br/><br/>"Very well, sir. And this stone?"<br/><br/>"Ah, yes, I shall keep the stone. Thank you. And, I say,<br/>Peterson, just buy a goose on your way back and leave it here with<br/>me, for we must have one to give to this gentleman in place of the<br/>one which your family is now devouring."<br/><br/>When the commissionaire had gone, Holmes took up the stone and<br/>held it against the light. "It's a bonny thing," said he. "Just see<br/>how it glints and sparkles. Of course it is a nucleus and focus of<br/>crime. Every good stone is. They are the devil's pet baits. In the<br/>larger and older jewels every facet may stand for a bloody deed.<br/>This stone is not yet twenty years old. It was found in the banks<br/>of the Amoy River in southern China and is remarkable in having<br/>every characteristic of the carbuncle, save that it is blue in<br/>shade instead of ruby red. In spite of its youth, it has already a<br/>sinister history. There have been two murders, a vitriol-throwing,<br/>a suicide, and several robberies brought about for the sake of this<br/>forty-grain weight of crystallised charcoal. Who would think that<br/>so pretty a toy would be a purveyor to the gallows and the prison?<br/>I'll lock it up in my strong box now and drop a line to the<br/>Countess to say that we have it."<br/><br/>"Do you think that this man Horner is innocent?"<br/><br/>"I cannot tell."<br/>
