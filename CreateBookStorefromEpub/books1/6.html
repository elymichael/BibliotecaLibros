<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>To Sherlock Holmes she is always THE woman. I have seldom heard<br/>him mention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses and<br/>predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any<br/>emotion akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that one<br/>particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably<br/>balanced mind. He was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and<br/>observing machine that the world has seen, but as a lover he would<br/>have placed himself in a false position. He never spoke of the<br/>softer passions, save with a gibe and a sneer. They were admirable<br/>things for the observer—excellent for drawing the veil from men's<br/>motives and actions. But for the trained reasoner to admit such<br/>intrusions into his own delicate and finely adjusted temperament<br/>was to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt<br/>upon all his mental results. Grit in a sensitive instrument, or a<br/>crack in one of his own high-power lenses, would not be more<br/>disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his. And yet<br/>there was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene<br/>Adler, of dubious and questionable memory.<br/><br/>I had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us<br/>away from each other. My own complete happiness, and the<br/>home-centred interests which rise up around the man who first finds<br/>himself master of his own establishment, were sufficient to absorb<br/>all my attention, while Holmes, who loathed every form of society<br/>with his whole Bohemian soul, remained in our lodgings in Baker<br/>Street, buried among his old books, and alternating from week to<br/>week between cocaine and ambition, the drowsiness of the drug, and<br/>the fierce energy of his own keen nature. He was still, as ever,<br/>deeply attracted by the study of crime, and occupied his immense<br/>faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in following out<br/>those clues, and clearing up those mysteries which had been<br/>abandoned as hopeless by the official police. From time to time I<br/>heard some vague account of his doings: of his summons to Odessa in<br/>the case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing up of the singular<br/>tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee, and finally of the<br/>mission which he had accomplished so delicately and successfully<br/>for the reigning family of Holland. Beyond these signs of his<br/>activity, however, which I merely shared with all the readers of<br/>the daily press, I knew little of my former friend and<br/>companion.<br/><br/>One night—it was on the twentieth of March, 1888—I was returning<br/>from a journey to a patient (for I had now returned to civil<br/>practice), when my way led me through Baker Street. As I passed the<br/>well-remembered door, which must always be associated in my mind<br/>with my wooing, and with the dark incidents of the Study in<br/>Scarlet, I was seized with a keen desire to see Holmes again, and<br/>to know how he was employing his extraordinary powers. His rooms<br/>were brilliantly lit, and, even as I looked up, I saw his tall,<br/>spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against the blind. He<br/>was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his head sunk upon his<br/>chest and his hands clasped behind him. To me, who knew his every<br/>mood and habit, his attitude and manner told their own story. He<br/>was at work again. He had risen out of his drug-created dreams and<br/>was hot upon the scent of some new problem. I rang the bell and was<br/>shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in part my own.<br/><br/>His manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad, I<br/>think, to see me. With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye,<br/>he waved me to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars, and<br/>indicated a spirit case and a gasogene in the corner. Then he stood<br/>before the fire and looked me over in his singular introspective<br/>fashion.<br/><br/>"Wedlock suits you," he remarked. "I think, Watson, that you<br/>have put on seven and a half pounds since I saw you."<br/><br/>"Seven!" I answered.<br/><br/>
