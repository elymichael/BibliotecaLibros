"There are three men waiting for him at the door," said
Holmes.

"Oh, indeed! You seem to have done the thing very completely. I
must compliment you."

"And I you," Holmes answered. "Your red-headed idea was very new
and effective."

"You'll see your pal again presently," said Jones. "He's quicker
at climbing down holes than I am. Just hold out while I fix the
derbies."

"I beg that you will not touch me with your filthy hands,"
remarked our prisoner as the handcuffs clattered upon his wrists.
"You may not be aware that I have royal blood in my veins. Have the
goodness, also, when you address me always to say 'sir' and
'please.'"

"All right," said Jones with a stare and a snigger. "Well, would
you please, sir, march upstairs, where we can get a cab to carry
your Highness to the police-station?"

"That is better," said John Clay serenely. He made a sweeping
bow to the three of us and walked quietly off in the custody of the
detective.

"Really, Mr. Holmes," said Mr. Merryweather as we followed them
from the cellar, "I do not know how the bank can thank you or repay
you. There is no doubt that you have detected and defeated in the
most complete manner one of the most determined attempts at bank
robbery that have ever come within my experience."

"I have had one or two little scores of my own to settle with
Mr. John Clay," said Holmes. "I have been at some small expense
over this matter, which I shall expect the bank to refund, but
beyond that I am amply repaid by having had an experience which is
in many ways unique, and by hearing the very remarkable narrative
of the Red-headed League."

"You see, Watson," he explained in the early hours of the
morning as we sat over a glass of whisky and soda in Baker Street,
"it was perfectly obvious from the first that the only possible
object of this rather fantastic business of the advertisement of
the League, and the copying of the 'Encyclopaedia,' must be to get
this not over-bright pawnbroker out of the way for a number of
hours every day. It was a curious way of managing it, but, really,
it would be difficult to suggest a better. The method was no doubt
suggested to Clay's ingenious mind by the colour of his
accomplice's hair. The 4 pounds a week was a lure which must draw
him, and what was it to them, who were playing for thousands? They
put in the advertisement, one rogue has the temporary office, the
other rogue incites the man to apply for it, and together they
manage to secure his absence every morning in the week. From the
time that I heard of the assistant having come for half wages, it
was obvious to me that he had some strong motive for securing the
situation."
