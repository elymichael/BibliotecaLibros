<br/>It was a singular sight which met our eyes. On the table stood a<br/>dark-lantern with the shutter half open, throwing a brilliant beam<br/>of light upon the iron safe, the door of which was ajar. Beside<br/>this table, on the wooden chair, sat Dr. Grimesby Roylott clad in a<br/>long grey dressing-gown, his bare ankles protruding beneath, and<br/>his feet thrust into red heelless Turkish slippers. Across his lap<br/>lay the short stock with the long lash which we had noticed during<br/>the day. His chin was cocked upward and his eyes were fixed in a<br/>dreadful, rigid stare at the corner of the ceiling. Round his brow<br/>he had a peculiar yellow band, with brownish speckles, which seemed<br/>to be bound tightly round his head. As we entered he made neither<br/>sound nor motion.<br/><br/>"The band! the speckled band!" whispered Holmes.<br/><br/>I took a step forward. In an instant his strange headgear began<br/>to move, and there reared itself from among his hair the squat<br/>diamond-shaped head and puffed neck of a loathsome serpent.<br/><br/>"It is a swamp adder!" cried Holmes; "the deadliest snake in<br/>India. He has died within ten seconds of being bitten. Violence<br/>does, in truth, recoil upon the violent, and the schemer falls into<br/>the pit which he digs for another. Let us thrust this creature back<br/>into its den, and we can then remove Miss Stoner to some place of<br/>shelter and let the county police know what has happened."<br/><br/>As he spoke he drew the dog-whip swiftly from the dead man's<br/>lap, and throwing the noose round the reptile's neck he drew it<br/>from its horrid perch and, carrying it at arm's length, threw it<br/>into the iron safe, which he closed upon it.<br/><br/>Such are the true facts of the death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott, of<br/>Stoke Moran. It is not necessary that I should prolong a narrative<br/>which has already run to too great a length by telling how we broke<br/>the sad news to the terrified girl, how we conveyed her by the<br/>morning train to the care of her good aunt at Harrow, of how the<br/>slow process of official inquiry came to the conclusion that the<br/>doctor met his fate while indiscreetly playing with a dangerous<br/>pet. The little which I had yet to learn of the case was told me by<br/>Sherlock Holmes as we travelled back next day.<br/><br/>"I had," said he, "come to an entirely erroneous conclusion<br/>which shows, my dear Watson, how dangerous it always is to reason<br/>from insufficient data. The presence of the gipsies, and the use of<br/>the word 'band,' which was used by the poor girl, no doubt, to<br/>explain the appearance which she had caught a hurried glimpse of by<br/>the light of her match, were sufficient to put me upon an entirely<br/>wrong scent. I can only claim the merit that I instantly<br/>reconsidered my position when, however, it became clear to me that<br/>whatever danger threatened an occupant of the room could not come<br/>either from the window or the door. My attention was speedily<br/>drawn, as I have already remarked to you, to this ventilator, and<br/>to the bell-rope which hung down to the bed. The discovery that<br/>this was a dummy, and that the bed was clamped to the floor,<br/>instantly gave rise to the suspicion that the rope was there as a<br/>bridge for something passing through the hole and coming to the<br/>bed. The idea of a snake instantly occurred to me, and when I<br/>coupled it with my knowledge that the doctor was furnished with a<br/>supply of creatures from India, I felt that I was probably on the<br/>right track. The idea of using a form of poison which could not<br/>possibly be discovered by any chemical test was just such a one as<br/>would occur to a clever and ruthless man who had had an Eastern<br/>training. The rapidity with which such a poison would take effect<br/>would also, from his point of view, be an advantage. It would be a<br/>sharp-eyed coroner, indeed, who could distinguish the two little<br/>dark punctures which would show where the poison fangs had done<br/>their work. Then I thought of the whistle. Of course he must recall<br/>the snake before the morning light revealed it to the victim. He<br/>had trained it, probably by the use of the milk which we saw, to<br/>return to him when summoned. He would put it through this<br/>ventilator at the hour that he thought best, with the certainty<br/>that it would crawl down the rope and land on the bed. It might or<br/>might not bite the occupant, perhaps she might escape every night<br/>for a week, but sooner or later she must fall a victim.<br/><br/>"I had come to these conclusions before ever I had entered his<br/>room. An inspection of his chair showed me that he had been in the<br/>habit of standing on it, which of course would be necessary in<br/>order that he should reach the ventilator. The sight of the safe,<br/>the saucer of milk, and the loop of whipcord were enough to finally<br/>dispel any doubts which may have remained. The metallic clang heard<br/>by Miss Stoner was obviously caused by her stepfather hastily<br/>closing the door of his safe upon its terrible occupant. Having<br/>once made up my mind, you know the steps which I took in order to<br/>put the matter to the proof. I heard the creature hiss as I have no<br/>doubt that you did also, and I instantly lit the light and attacked<br/>it."<br/><br/>"With the result of driving it through the ventilator."<br/><br/>"And also with the result of causing it to turn upon its master<br/>at the other side. Some of the blows of my cane came home and<br/>roused its snakish temper, so that it flew upon the first person it<br/>saw. In this way I am no doubt indirectly responsible for Dr.<br/>Grimesby Roylott's death, and I cannot say that it is likely to<br/>weigh very heavily upon my conscience."<br/><br/>
