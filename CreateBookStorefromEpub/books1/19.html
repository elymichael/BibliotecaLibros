"Quite so; but the sequel was rather unusual. I will tell you,<br/>however. I left the house a little after eight o'clock this morning<br/>in the character of a groom out of work. There is a wonderful<br/>sympathy and freemasonry among horsey men. Be one of them, and you<br/>will know all that there is to know. I soon found Briony Lodge. It<br/>is a bijou villa, with a garden at the back, but built out in front<br/>right up to the road, two stories. Chubb lock to the door. Large<br/>sitting-room on the right side, well furnished, with long windows<br/>almost to the floor, and those preposterous English window<br/>fasteners which a child could open. Behind there was nothing<br/>remarkable, save that the passage window could be reached from the<br/>top of the coach-house. I walked round it and examined it closely<br/>from every point of view, but without noting anything else of<br/>interest.<br/><br/>"I then lounged down the street and found, as I expected, that<br/>there was a mews in a lane which runs down by one wall of the<br/>garden. I lent the ostlers a hand in rubbing down their horses, and<br/>received in exchange twopence, a glass of half and half, two fills<br/>of shag tobacco, and as much information as I could desire about<br/>Miss Adler, to say nothing of half a dozen other people in the<br/>neighbourhood in whom I was not in the least interested, but whose<br/>biographies I was compelled to listen to."<br/><br/>"And what of Irene Adler?" I asked.<br/><br/>"Oh, she has turned all the men's heads down in that part. She<br/>is the daintiest thing under a bonnet on this planet. So say the<br/>Serpentine-mews, to a man. She lives quietly, sings at concerts,<br/>drives out at five every day, and returns at seven sharp for<br/>dinner. Seldom goes out at other times, except when she sings. Has<br/>only one male visitor, but a good deal of him. He is dark,<br/>handsome, and dashing, never calls less than once a day, and often<br/>twice. He is a Mr. Godfrey Norton, of the Inner Temple. See the<br/>advantages of a cabman as a confidant. They had driven him home a<br/>dozen times from Serpentine-mews, and knew all about him. When I<br/>had listened to all they had to tell, I began to walk up and down<br/>near Briony Lodge once more, and to think over my plan of<br/>campaign.<br/><br/>"This Godfrey Norton was evidently an important factor in the<br/>matter. He was a lawyer. That sounded ominous. What was the<br/>relation between them, and what the object of his repeated visits?<br/>Was she his client, his friend, or his mistress? If the former, she<br/>had probably transferred the photograph to his keeping. If the<br/>latter, it was less likely. On the issue of this question depended<br/>whether I should continue my work at Briony Lodge, or turn my<br/>attention to the gentleman's chambers in the Temple. It was a<br/>delicate point, and it widened the field of my inquiry. I fear that<br/>I bore you with these details, but I have to let you see my little<br/>difficulties, if you are to understand the situation."<br/><br/>"I am following you closely," I answered.<br/><br/>"I was still balancing the matter in my mind when a hansom cab<br/>drove up to Briony Lodge, and a gentleman sprang out. He was a<br/>remarkably handsome man, dark, aquiline, and moustachedâ€” evidently<br/>the man of whom I had heard. He appeared to be in a great hurry,<br/>shouted to the cabman to wait, and brushed past the maid who opened<br/>the door with the air of a man who was thoroughly at home.<br/><br/>"He was in the house about half an hour, and I could catch<br/>glimpses of him in the windows of the sitting-room, pacing up and<br/>down, talking excitedly, and waving his arms. Of her I could see<br/>nothing. Presently he emerged, looking even more flurried than<br/>before. As he stepped up to the cab, he pulled a gold watch from<br/>his pocket and looked at it earnestly, 'Drive like the devil,' he<br/>shouted, 'first to Gross &amp; Hankey's in Regent Street, and then<br/>to the Church of St. Monica in the Edgeware Road. Half a guinea if<br/>you do it in twenty minutes!'<br/><br/>"Away they went, and I was just wondering whether I should not<br/>do well to follow them when up the lane came a neat little landau,<br/>the coachman with his coat only half-buttoned, and his tie under<br/>his ear, while all the tags of his harness were sticking out of the<br/>buckles. It hadn't pulled up before she shot out of the hall door<br/>and into it. I only caught a glimpse of her at the moment, but she<br/>was a lovely woman, with a face that a man might die for.<br/><br/>"'The Church of St. Monica, John,' she cried, 'and half a<br/>sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes.'<br/><br/>"This was quite too good to lose, Watson. I was just balancing<br/>whether I should run for it, or whether I should perch behind her<br/>landau when a cab came through the street. The driver looked twice<br/>at such a shabby fare, but I jumped in before he could object. 'The<br/>Church of St. Monica,' said I, 'and half a sovereign if you reach<br/>it in twenty minutes.' It was twenty-five minutes to twelve, and of<br/>course it was clear enough what was in the wind.<br/>
