<br/><br/><br/>"Holmes," said I as I stood one morning in our bow-window<br/>looking down the street, "here is a madman coming along. It seems<br/>rather sad that his relatives should allow him to come out<br/>alone."<br/><br/>My friend rose lazily from his armchair and stood with his hands<br/>in the pockets of his dressing-gown, looking over my shoulder. It<br/>was a bright, crisp February morning, and the snow of the day<br/>before still lay deep upon the ground, shimmering brightly in the<br/>wintry sun. Down the centre of Baker Street it had been ploughed<br/>into a brown crumbly band by the traffic, but at either side and on<br/>the heaped-up edges of the foot-paths it still lay as white as when<br/>it fell. The grey pavement had been cleaned and scraped, but was<br/>still dangerously slippery, so that there were fewer passengers<br/>than usual. Indeed, from the direction of the Metropolitan Station<br/>no one was coming save the single gentleman whose eccentric conduct<br/>had drawn my attention.<br/><br/>He was a man of about fifty, tall, portly, and imposing, with a<br/>massive, strongly marked face and a commanding figure. He was<br/>dressed in a sombre yet rich style, in black frock-coat, shining<br/>hat, neat brown gaiters, and well-cut pearl-grey trousers. Yet his<br/>actions were in absurd contrast to the dignity of his dress and<br/>features, for he was running hard, with occasional little springs,<br/>such as a weary man gives who is little accustomed to set any tax<br/>upon his legs. As he ran he jerked his hands up and down, waggled<br/>his head, and writhed his face into the most extraordinary<br/>contortions.<br/><br/>"What on earth can be the matter with him?" I asked. "He is<br/>looking up at the numbers of the houses."<br/><br/>"I believe that he is coming here," said Holmes, rubbing his<br/>hands.<br/><br/>"Here?"<br/><br/>"Yes; I rather think he is coming to consult me professionally.<br/>I think that I recognise the symptoms. Ha! did I not tell you?" As<br/>he spoke, the man, puffing and blowing, rushed at our door and<br/>pulled at our bell until the whole house resounded with the<br/>clanging.<br/><br/>A few moments later he was in our room, still puffing, still<br/>gesticulating, but with so fixed a look of grief and despair in his<br/>eyes that our smiles were turned in an instant to horror and pity.<br/>For a while he could not get his words out, but swayed his body and<br/>plucked at his hair like one who has been driven to the extreme<br/>limits of his reason. Then, suddenly springing to his feet, he beat<br/>his head against the wall with such force that we both rushed upon<br/>him and tore him away to the centre of the room. Sherlock Holmes<br/>pushed him down into the easy-chair and, sitting beside him, patted<br/>his hand and chatted with him in the easy, soothing tones which he<br/>knew so well how to employ.<br/><br/>"You have come to me to tell your story, have you not?" said he.<br/>"You are fatigued with your haste. Pray wait until you have<br/>recovered yourself, and then I shall be most happy to look into any<br/>little problem which you may submit to me."<br/><br/>The man sat for a minute or more with a heaving chest, fighting<br/>against his emotion. Then he passed his handkerchief over his brow,<br/>set his lips tight, and turned his face towards us.<br/>
