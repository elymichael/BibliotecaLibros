<br/>The ejaculation had been drawn from my companion by the fact<br/>that our door had been suddenly dashed open, and that a huge man<br/>had framed himself in the aperture. His costume was a peculiar<br/>mixture of the professional and of the agricultural, having a black<br/>top-hat, a long frock-coat, and a pair of high gaiters, with a<br/>hunting-crop swinging in his hand. So tall was he that his hat<br/>actually brushed the cross bar of the doorway, and his breadth<br/>seemed to span it across from side to side. A large face, seared<br/>with a thousand wrinkles, burned yellow with the sun, and marked<br/>with every evil passion, was turned from one to the other of us,<br/>while his deep-set, bile-shot eyes, and his high, thin, fleshless<br/>nose, gave him somewhat the resemblance to a fierce old bird of<br/>prey.<br/><br/>"Which of you is Holmes?" asked this apparition.<br/><br/>"My name, sir; but you have the advantage of me," said my<br/>companion quietly.<br/><br/>"I am Dr. Grimesby Roylott, of Stoke Moran."<br/><br/>"Indeed, Doctor," said Holmes blandly. "Pray take a seat."<br/><br/>"I will do nothing of the kind. My stepdaughter has been here. I<br/>have traced her. What has she been saying to you?"<br/><br/>"It is a little cold for the time of the year," said Holmes.<br/><br/>"What has she been saying to you?" screamed the old man<br/>furiously.<br/><br/>"But I have heard that the crocuses promise well," continued my<br/>companion imperturbably.<br/><br/>"Ha! You put me off, do you?" said our new visitor, taking a<br/>step forward and shaking his hunting-crop. "I know you, you<br/>scoundrel! I have heard of you before. You are Holmes, the<br/>meddler."<br/><br/>
