"Your father," said Holmes, "your stepfather, surely, since the
name is different."

"Yes, my stepfather. I call him father, though it sounds funny,
too, for he is only five years and two months older than
myself."

"And your mother is alive?"

"Oh, yes, mother is alive and well. I wasn't best pleased, Mr.
Holmes, when she married again so soon after father's death, and a
man who was nearly fifteen years younger than herself. Father was a
plumber in the Tottenham Court Road, and he left a tidy business
behind him, which mother carried on with Mr. Hardy, the foreman;
but when Mr. Windibank came he made her sell the business, for he
was very superior, being a traveller in wines. They got 4700 pounds
for the goodwill and interest, which wasn't near as much as father
could have got if he had been alive."

I had expected to see Sherlock Holmes impatient under this
rambling and inconsequential narrative, but, on the contrary, he
had listened with the greatest concentration of attention.

"Your own little income," he asked, "does it come out of the
business?"

"Oh, no, sir. It is quite separate and was left me by my uncle
Ned in Auckland. It is in New Zealand stock, paying 4 1/2 per cent.
Two thousand five hundred pounds was the amount, but I can only
touch the interest."

"You interest me extremely," said Holmes. "And since you draw so
large a sum as a hundred a year, with what you earn into the
bargain, you no doubt travel a little and indulge yourself in every
way. I believe that a single lady can get on very nicely upon an
income of about 60 pounds."

"I could do with much less than that, Mr. Holmes, but you
understand that as long as I live at home I don't wish to be a
burden to them, and so they have the use of the money just while I
am staying with them. Of course, that is only just for the time.
Mr. Windibank draws my interest every quarter and pays it over to
mother, and I find that I can do pretty well with what I earn at
typewriting. It brings me twopence a sheet, and I can often do from
fifteen to twenty sheets in a day."

"You have made your position very clear to me," said Holmes.
"This is my friend, Dr. Watson, before whom you can speak as freely
as before myself. Kindly tell us now all about your connection with
Mr. Hosmer Angel."

A flush stole over Miss Sutherland's face, and she picked
nervously at the fringe of her jacket. "I met him first at the
gasfitters' ball," she said. "They used to send father tickets when
he was alive, and then afterwards they remembered us, and sent them
to mother. Mr. Windibank did not wish us to go. He never did wish
us to go anywhere. He would get quite mad if I wanted so much as to
join a Sunday-school treat. But this time I was set on going, and I
would go; for what right had he to prevent? He said the folk were
not fit for us to know, when all father's friends were to be there.
And he said that I had nothing fit to wear, when I had my purple
plush that I had never so much as taken out of the drawer. At last,
when nothing else would do, he went off to France upon the business
of the firm, but we went, mother and I, with Mr. Hardy, who used to
be our foreman, and it was there I met Mr. Hosmer Angel."
