Better make it out for 4000 pounds."<br/><br/>With a dazed face the banker made out the required check. Holmes<br/>walked over to his desk, took out a little triangular piece of gold<br/>with three gems in it, and threw it down upon the table.<br/><br/>With a shriek of joy our client clutched it up.<br/><br/>"You have it!" he gasped. "I am saved! I am saved!"<br/><br/>The reaction of joy was as passionate as his grief had been, and<br/>he hugged his recovered gems to his bosom.<br/><br/>"There is one other thing you owe, Mr. Holder," said Sherlock<br/>Holmes rather sternly.<br/><br/>"Owe!" He caught up a pen. "Name the sum, and I will pay<br/>it."<br/><br/>"No, the debt is not to me.

Then let us hurry to him at once to let him<br/>know that the truth is known."<br/>
