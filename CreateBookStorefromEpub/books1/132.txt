"Last Monday I had finished for the day and was dressing in my
room above the opium den when I looked out of my window and saw, to
my horror and astonishment, that my wife was standing in the
street, with her eyes fixed full upon me. I gave a cry of surprise,
threw up my arms to cover my face, and, rushing to my confidant,
the Lascar, entreated him to prevent anyone from coming up to me. I
heard her voice downstairs, but I knew that she could not ascend.
Swiftly I threw off my clothes, pulled on those of a beggar, and
put on my pigments and wig. Even a wife's eyes could not pierce so
complete a disguise. But then it occurred to me that there might be
a search in the room, and that the clothes might betray me. I threw
open the window, reopening by my violence a small cut which I had
inflicted upon myself in the bedroom that morning. Then I seized my
coat, which was weighted by the coppers which I had just
transferred to it from the leather bag in which I carried my
takings. I hurled it out of the window, and it disappeared into the
Thames. The other clothes would have followed, but at that moment
there was a rush of constables up the stair, and a few minutes
after I found, rather, I confess, to my relief, that instead of
being identified as Mr. Neville St. Clair, I was arrested as his
murderer.

"I do not know that there is anything else for me to explain. I
was determined to preserve my disguise as long as possible, and
hence my preference for a dirty face. Knowing that my wife would be
terribly anxious, I slipped off my ring and confided it to the
Lascar at a moment when no constable was watching me, together with
a hurried scrawl, telling her that she had no cause to fear."

"That note only reached her yesterday," said Holmes.

"Good God! What a week she must have spent!"

"The police have watched this Lascar," said Inspector
Bradstreet, "and I can quite understand that he might find it
difficult to post a letter unobserved. Probably he handed it to
some sailor customer of his, who forgot all about it for some
days."

"That was it," said Holmes, nodding approvingly; "I have no
doubt of it. But have you never been prosecuted for begging?"

"Many times; but what was a fine to me?"

"It must stop here, however," said Bradstreet. "If the police
are to hush this thing up, there must be no more of Hugh
Boone."

"I have sworn it by the most solemn oaths which a man can
take."

"In that case I think that it is probable that no further steps
may be taken. But if you are found again, then all must come out. I
am sure, Mr. Holmes, that we are very much indebted to you for
having cleared the matter up. I wish I knew how you reach your
results."

"I reached this one," said my friend, "by sitting upon five
pillows and consuming an ounce of shag. I think, Watson, that if we
drive to Baker Street we shall just be in time for breakfast."
