<br/>"It is fear, Mr. Holmes. It is terror." She raised her veil as<br/>she spoke, and we could see that she was indeed in a pitiable state<br/>of agitation, her face all drawn and grey, with restless frightened<br/>eyes, like those of some hunted animal. Her features and figure<br/>were those of a woman of thirty, but her hair was shot with<br/>premature grey, and her expression was weary and haggard. Sherlock<br/>Holmes ran her over with one of his quick, all-comprehensive<br/>glances.<br/><br/>"You must not fear," said he soothingly, bending forward and<br/>patting her forearm. "We shall soon set matters right, I have no<br/>doubt. You have come in by train this morning, I see."<br/><br/>"You know me, then?"<br/><br/>"No, but I observe the second half of a return ticket in the<br/>palm of your left glove. You must have started early, and yet you<br/>had a good drive in a dog-cart, along heavy roads, before you<br/>reached the station."<br/><br/>The lady gave a violent start and stared in bewilderment at my<br/>companion.<br/><br/>"There is no mystery, my dear madam," said he, smiling. "The<br/>left arm of your jacket is spattered with mud in no less than seven<br/>places. The marks are perfectly fresh. There is no vehicle save a<br/>dog-cart which throws up mud in that way, and then only when you<br/>sit on the left-hand side of the driver."<br/><br/>"Whatever your reasons may be, you are perfectly correct," said<br/>she. "I started from home before six, reached Leatherhead at twenty<br/>past, and came in by the first train to Waterloo. Sir, I can stand<br/>this strain no longer; I shall go mad if it continues. I have no<br/>one to turn toâ€”none, save only one, who cares for me, and he, poor<br/>fellow, can be of little aid. I have heard of you, Mr. Holmes; I<br/>have heard of you from Mrs. Farintosh, whom you helped in the hour<br/>of her sore need. It was from her that I had your address. Oh, sir,<br/>do you not think that you could help me, too, and at least throw a<br/>little light through the dense darkness which surrounds me? At<br/>present it is out of my power to reward you for your services, but<br/>in a month or six weeks I shall be married, with the control of my<br/>own income, and then at least you shall not find me<br/>ungrateful."<br/><br/>Holmes turned to his desk and, unlocking it, drew out a small<br/>case-book, which he consulted.<br/><br/>"Farintosh," said he. "Ah yes, I recall the case; it was<br/>concerned with an opal tiara. I think it was before your time,<br/>Watson. I can only say, madam, that I shall be happy to devote the<br/>same care to your case as I did to that of your friend. As to<br/>reward, my profession is its own reward; but you are at liberty to<br/>defray whatever expenses I may be put to, at the time which suits<br/>you best. And now I beg that you will lay before us everything that<br/>may help us in forming an opinion upon the matter."<br/><br/>"Alas!" replied our visitor, "the very horror of my situation<br/>lies in the fact that my fears are so vague, and my suspicions<br/>depend so entirely upon small points, which might seem trivial to<br/>another, that even he to whom of all others I have a right to look<br/>for help and advice looks upon all that I tell him about it as the<br/>fancies of a nervous woman. He does not say so, but I can read it<br/>from his soothing answers and averted eyes. But I have heard, Mr.<br/>Holmes, that you can see deeply into the manifold wickedness of the<br/>human heart. You may advise me how to walk amid the dangers which<br/>encompass me."<br/><br/>
