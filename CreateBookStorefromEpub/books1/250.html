<br/>"'Oh, tut, tut! sweating—rank sweating!' he cried, throwing his<br/>fat hands out into the air like a man who is in a boiling passion.<br/>'How could anyone offer so pitiful a sum to a lady with such<br/>attractions and accomplishments?'<br/><br/>"'My accomplishments, sir, may be less than you imagine,' said<br/>I. 'A little French, a little German, music, and drawing—'<br/><br/>"'Tut, tut!' he cried. 'This is all quite beside the question.<br/>The point is, have you or have you not the bearing and deportment<br/>of a lady? There it is in a nutshell. If you have not, you are not<br/>fitted for the rearing of a child who may some day play a<br/>considerable part in the history of the country. But if you have<br/>why, then, how could any gentleman ask you to condescend to accept<br/>anything under the three figures? Your salary with me, madam, would<br/>commence at 100 pounds a year.'<br/><br/>"You may imagine, Mr. Holmes, that to me, destitute as I was,<br/>such an offer seemed almost too good to be true. The gentleman,<br/>however, seeing perhaps the look of incredulity upon my face,<br/>opened a pocket-book and took out a note.<br/><br/>"'It is also my custom,' said he, smiling in the most pleasant<br/>fashion until his eyes were just two little shining slits amid the<br/>white creases of his face, 'to advance to my young ladies half<br/>their salary beforehand, so that they may meet any little expenses<br/>of their journey and their wardrobe.'<br/><br/>"It seemed to me that I had never met so fascinating and so<br/>thoughtful a man. As I was already in debt to my tradesmen, the<br/>advance was a great convenience, and yet there was something<br/>unnatural about the whole transaction which made me wish to know a<br/>little more before I quite committed myself.<br/><br/>"'May I ask where you live, sir?' said I.<br/><br/>"'Hampshire. Charming rural place. The Copper Beeches, five<br/>miles on the far side of Winchester. It is the most lovely country,<br/>my dear young lady, and the dearest old country-house.'<br/><br/>"'And my duties, sir? I should be glad to know what they would<br/>be.'<br/><br/>"'One child—one dear little romper just six years old. Oh, if<br/>you could see him killing cockroaches with a slipper! Smack! smack!<br/>smack! Three gone before you could wink!' He leaned back in his<br/>chair and laughed his eyes into his head again.<br/><br/>
