"MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES,—You really did it very well. You<br/>took me in completely. Until after the alarm of fire, I had not a<br/>suspicion. But then, when I found how I had betrayed myself, I<br/>began to think. I had been warned against you months ago. I had<br/>been told that if the King employed an agent it would certainly be<br/>you. And your address had been given me. Yet, with all this, you<br/>made me reveal what you wanted to know. Even after I became<br/>suspicious, I found it hard to think evil of such a dear, kind old<br/>clergyman. But, you know, I have been trained as an actress myself.<br/>Male costume is nothing new to me. I often take advantage of the<br/>freedom which it gives. I sent John, the coachman, to watch you,<br/>ran up stairs, got into my walking-clothes, as I call them, and<br/>came down just as you departed.<br/><br/>"Well, I followed you to your door, and so made sure that I was<br/>really an object of interest to the celebrated Mr. Sherlock Holmes.<br/>Then I, rather imprudently, wished you good-night, and started for<br/>the Temple to see my husband.<br/><br/>"We both thought the best resource was flight, when pursued by<br/>so formidable an antagonist; so you will find the nest empty when<br/>you call to-morrow. As to the photograph, your client may rest in<br/>peace. I love and am loved by a better man than he. The King may do<br/>what he will without hindrance from one whom he has cruelly<br/>wronged. I keep it only to safeguard myself, and to preserve a<br/>weapon which will always secure me from any steps which he might<br/>take in the future. I leave a photograph which he might care to<br/>possess; and I remain, dear Mr. Sherlock Holmes,<br/><br/>"Very truly yours, "IRENE NORTON, née ADLER."<br/><br/>"What a woman—oh, what a woman!" cried the King of Bohemia, when<br/>we had all three read this epistle. "Did I not tell you how quick<br/>and resolute she was? Would she not have made an admirable queen?<br/>Is it not a pity that she was not on my level?"<br/><br/>"From what I have seen of the lady she seems indeed to be on a<br/>very different level to your Majesty," said Holmes coldly. "I am<br/>sorry that I have not been able to bring your Majesty's business to<br/>a more successful conclusion."<br/><br/>"On the contrary, my dear sir," cried the King; "nothing could<br/>be more successful. I know that her word is inviolate. The<br/>photograph is now as safe as if it were in the fire."<br/><br/>"I am glad to hear your Majesty say so."<br/><br/>"I am immensely indebted to you. Pray tell me in what way I can<br/>reward you. This ring—" He slipped an emerald snake ring from his<br/>finger and held it out upon the palm of his hand.<br/><br/>"Your Majesty has something which I should value even more<br/>highly," said Holmes.<br/><br/>"You have but to name it."<br/>
