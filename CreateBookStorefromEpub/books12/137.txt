"Jim," says he, "I reckon we're fouled, you and me, and we'll
have to sign articles. I'd have had you but for that there lurch,
but I don't have no luck, not I; and I reckon I'll have to strike,
which comes hard, you see, for a master mariner to a ship's younker
like you, Jim."

I was drinking in his words and smiling away, as conceited as a
cock upon a wall, when, all in a breath, back went his right hand
over his shoulder. Something sang like an arrow through the air; I
felt a blow and then a sharp pang, and there I was pinned by the
shoulder to the mast. In the horrid pain and surprise of the
moment—I scarce can say it was by my own volition, and I am sure it
was without a conscious aim—both my pistols went off, and both
escaped out of my hands. They did not fall alone; with a choked
cry, the coxswain loosed his grasp upon the shrouds and plunged
head first into the water.
