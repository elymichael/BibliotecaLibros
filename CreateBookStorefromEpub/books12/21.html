I slipped the bolt at once, and we stood and panted for a moment<br/>in the dark, alone in the house with the dead captain's body. Then<br/>my mother got a candle in the bar, and holding each other's hands,<br/>we advanced into the parlour. He lay as we had left him, on his<br/>back, with his eyes open and one arm stretched out.<br/><br/>"Draw down the blind, Jim," whispered my mother; "they might<br/>come and watch outside. And now," said she when I had done so, "we<br/>have to get the key off that; and who's to touch it, I should like<br/>to know!" and she gave a kind of sob as she said the words.<br/><br/>I went down on my knees at once. On the floor close to his hand<br/>there was a little round of paper, blackened on the one side. I<br/>could not doubt that this was the Black Spot; and taking it up, I<br/>found written on the other side, in a very good, clear hand, this<br/>short message: "You have till ten tonight."<br/><br/>"He had till ten, Mother," said I; and just as I said it, our<br/>old clock began striking. This sudden noise startled us shockingly;<br/>but the news was good, for it was only six.<br/><br/>"Now, Jim," she said, "that key."<br/><br/>I felt in his pockets, one after another. A few small coins, a<br/>thimble, and some thread and big needles, a piece of pigtail<br/>tobacco bitten away at the end, his gully with the crooked handle,<br/>a pocket compass, and a tinder box were all that they contained,<br/>and I began to despair.<br/><br/>"Perhaps it's round his neck," suggested my mother.<br/><br/>Overcoming a strong repugnance, I tore open his shirt at the<br/>neck, and there, sure enough, hanging to a bit of tarry string,<br/>which I cut with his own gully, we found the key. At this triumph<br/>we were filled with hope and hurried upstairs without delay to the<br/>little room where he had slept so long and where his box had stood<br/>since the day of his arrival.<br/><br/>It was like any other seaman's chest on the outside, the initial<br/>"B" burned on the top of it with a hot iron, and the corners<br/>somewhat smashed and broken as by long, rough usage.<br/><br/>"Give me the key," said my mother; and though the lock was very<br/>stiff, she had turned it and thrown back the lid in a<br/>twinkling.<br/><br/>A strong smell of tobacco and tar rose from the interior, but<br/>nothing was to be seen on the top except a suit of very good<br/>clothes, carefully brushed and folded. They had never been worn, my<br/>mother said. Under that, the miscellany beganâ€”a quadrant, a tin<br/>canikin, several sticks of tobacco, two brace of very handsome<br/>pistols, a piece of bar silver, an old Spanish watch and some other<br/>trinkets of little value and mostly of foreign make, a pair of<br/>compasses mounted with brass, and five or six curious West Indian<br/>shells. I have often wondered since why he should have carried<br/>about these shells with him in his wandering, guilty, and hunted<br/>life.<br/>
