Well, now that I had found the boat, you would have thought I<br/>had had enough of truantry for once, but in the meantime I had<br/>taken another notion and become so obstinately fond of it that I<br/>would have carried it out, I believe, in the teeth of Captain<br/>Smollett himself. This was to slip out under cover of the night,<br/>cut the Hispaniola adrift, and let her go ashore where she fancied.<br/>I had quite made up my mind that the mutineers, after their repulse<br/>of the morning, had nothing nearer their hearts than to up anchor<br/>and away to sea; this, I thought, it would be a fine thing to<br/>prevent, and now that I had seen how they left their watchmen<br/>unprovided with a boat, I thought it might be done with little<br/>risk.<br/><br/>Down I sat to wait for darkness, and made a hearty meal of<br/>biscuit. It was a night out of ten thousand for my purpose. The fog<br/>had now buried all heaven. As the last rays of daylight dwindled<br/>and disappeared, absolute blackness settled down on Treasure<br/>Island. And when, at last, I shouldered the coracle and groped my<br/>way stumblingly out of the hollow where I had supped, there were<br/>but two points visible on the whole anchorage.<br/><br/>One was the great fire on shore, by which the defeated pirates<br/>lay carousing in the swamp. The other, a mere blur of light upon<br/>the darkness, indicated the position of the anchored ship. She had<br/>swung round to the ebb—her bow was now towards me—the only lights<br/>on board were in the cabin, and what I saw was merely a reflection<br/>on the fog of the strong rays that flowed from the stern<br/>window.<br/><br/>The ebb had already run some time, and I had to wade through a<br/>long belt of swampy sand, where I sank several times above the<br/>ankle, before I came to the edge of the retreating water, and<br/>wading a little way in, with some strength and dexterity, set my<br/>coracle, keel downwards, on the surface.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
