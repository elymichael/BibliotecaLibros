Just then the noise of horses topped the rise, and four or five<br/>riders came in sight in the moonlight and swept at full gallop down<br/>the slope.<br/><br/>At this Pew saw his error, turned with a scream, and ran<br/>straight for the ditch, into which he rolled. But he was on his<br/>feet again in a second and made another dash, now utterly<br/>bewildered, right under the nearest of the coming horses.<br/><br/>The rider tried to save him, but in vain. Down went Pew with a<br/>cry that rang high into the night; and the four hoofs trampled and<br/>spurned him and passed by. He fell on his side, then gently<br/>collapsed upon his face and moved no more.<br/><br/>I leaped to my feet and hailed the riders. They were pulling up,<br/>at any rate, horrified at the accident; and I soon saw what they<br/>were. One, tailing out behind the rest, was a lad that had gone<br/>from the hamlet to Dr. Livesey's; the rest were revenue officers,<br/>whom he had met by the way, and with whom he had had the<br/>intelligence to return at once. Some news of the lugger in Kitt's<br/>Hole had found its way to Supervisor Dance and set him forth that<br/>night in our direction, and to that circumstance my mother and I<br/>owed our preservation from death.<br/><br/>Pew was dead, stone dead. As for my mother, when we had carried<br/>her up to the hamlet, a little cold water and salts and that soon<br/>brought her back again, and she was none the worse for her terror,<br/>though she still continued to deplore the balance of the money. In<br/>the meantime the supervisor rode on, as fast as he could, to Kitt's<br/>Hole; but his men had to dismount and grope down the dingle,<br/>leading, and sometimes supporting, their horses, and in continual<br/>fear of ambushes; so it was no great matter for surprise that when<br/>they got down to the Hole the lugger was already under way, though<br/>still close in. He hailed her. A voice replied, telling him to keep<br/>out of the moonlight or he would get some lead in him, and at the<br/>same time a bullet whistled close by his arm. Soon after, the<br/>lugger doubled the point and disappeared. Mr. Dance stood there, as<br/>he said, "like a fish out of water," and all he could do was to<br/>dispatch a man to B——to warn the cutter. "And that," said he, "is<br/>just about as good as nothing. They've got off clean, and there's<br/>an end. "Only," he added, "I'm glad I trod on Master Pew's corns,"<br/>for by this time he had heard my story.<br/><br/>I went back with him to the Admiral Benbow, and you cannot<br/>imagine a house in such a state of smash; the very clock had been<br/>thrown down by these fellows in their furious hunt after my mother<br/>and myself; and though nothing had actually been taken away except<br/>the captain's money-bag and a little silver from the till, I could<br/>see at once that we were ruined. Mr. Dance could make nothing of<br/>the scene.<br/><br/>"They got the money, you say? Well, then, Hawkins, what in<br/>fortune were they after? More money, I suppose?"<br/><br/>"No, sir; not money, I think," replied I. "In fact, sir, I<br/>believe I have the thing in my breast pocket; and to tell you the<br/>truth, I should like to get it put in safety."<br/><br/>"To be sure, boy; quite right," said he. "I'll take it, if you<br/>like."<br/><br/>"I thought perhaps Dr. Livesey—" I began.<br/><br/>"Perfectly right," he interrupted very cheerily, "perfectly<br/>right—a gentleman and a magistrate. And, now I come to think of it,<br/>I might as well ride round there myself and report to him or<br/>squire. Master Pew's dead, when all's done; not that I regret it,<br/>but he's dead, you see, and people will make it out against an<br/>officer of his Majesty's revenue, if make it out they can. Now,<br/>I'll tell you, Hawkins, if you like, I'll take you along."<br/>
