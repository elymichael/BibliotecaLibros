I had never seen the squire so near at hand. He was a tall man,<br/>over six feet high, and broad in proportion, and he had a bluff,<br/>rough-and-ready face, all roughened and reddened and lined in his<br/>long travels. His eyebrows were very black, and moved readily, and<br/>this gave him a look of some temper, not bad, you would say, but<br/>quick and high.<br/><br/>"Come in, Mr. Dance," says he, very stately and<br/>condescending.<br/><br/>"Good evening, Dance," says the doctor with a nod. "And good<br/>evening to you, friend Jim. What good wind brings you here?" The<br/>supervisor stood up straight and stiff and told his story like a<br/>lesson; and you should have seen how the two gentlemen leaned<br/>forward and looked at each other, and forgot to smoke in their<br/>surprise and interest. When they heard how my mother went back to<br/>the inn, Dr. Livesey fairly slapped his thigh, and the squire cried<br/>"Bravo!" and broke his long pipe against the grate. Long before it<br/>was done, Mr. Trelawney (that, you will remember, was the squire's<br/>name) had got up from his seat and was striding about the room, and<br/>the doctor, as if to hear the better, had taken off his powdered<br/>wig and sat there looking very strange indeed with his own<br/>close-cropped black poll."<br/><br/>At last Mr. Dance finished the story.<br/><br/>"Mr. Dance," said the squire, "you are a very noble fellow. And<br/>as for riding down that black, atrocious miscreant, I regard it as<br/>an act of virtue, sir, like stamping on a cockroach. This lad<br/>Hawkins is a trump, I perceive. Hawkins, will you ring that bell?<br/>Mr. Dance must have some ale."<br/><br/>"And so, Jim," said the doctor, "you have the thing that they<br/>were after, have you?"<br/><br/>"Here it is, sir," said I, and gave him the oilskin packet.<br/><br/>The doctor looked it all over, as if his fingers were itching to<br/>open it; but instead of doing that, he put it quietly in the pocket<br/>of his coat.<br/><br/>"Squire," said he, "when Dance has had his ale he must, of<br/>course, be off on his Majesty's service; but I mean to keep Jim<br/>Hawkins here to sleep at my house, and with your permission, I<br/>propose we should have up the cold pie and let him sup."<br/><br/>"As you will, Livesey," said the squire; "Hawkins has earned<br/>better than cold pie."<br/><br/>So a big pigeon pie was brought in and put on a sidetable, and I<br/>made a hearty supper, for I was as hungry as a hawk, while Mr.<br/>Dance was further complimented and at last dismissed.<br/>
