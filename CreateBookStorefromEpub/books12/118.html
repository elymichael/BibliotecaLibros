<br/>I took my way straight for the east coast of the island, for I<br/>was determined to go down the sea side of the spit to avoid all<br/>chance of observation from the anchorage. It was already late in<br/>the afternoon, although still warm and sunny. As I continued to<br/>thread the tall woods, I could hear from far before me not only the<br/>continuous thunder of the surf, but a certain tossing of foliage<br/>and grinding of boughs which showed me the sea breeze had set in<br/>higher than usual. Soon cool draughts of air began to reach me, and<br/>a few steps farther I came forth into the open borders of the<br/>grove, and saw the sea lying blue and sunny to the horizon and the<br/>surf tumbling and tossing its foam along the beach.<br/><br/>I have never seen the sea quiet round Treasure Island. The sun<br/>might blaze overhead, the air be without a breath, the surface<br/>smooth and blue, but still these great rollers would be running<br/>along all the external coast, thundering and thundering by day and<br/>night; and I scarce believe there is one spot in the island where a<br/>man would be out of earshot of their noise.<br/><br/>I walked along beside the surf with great enjoyment, till,<br/>thinking I was now got far enough to the south, I took the cover of<br/>some thick bushes and crept warily up to the ridge of the spit.<br/><br/>Behind me was the sea, in front the anchorage. The sea breeze,<br/>as though it had the sooner blown itself out by its unusual<br/>violence, was already at an end; it had been succeeded by light,<br/>variable airs from the south and south-east, carrying great banks<br/>of fog; and the anchorage, under lee of Skeleton Island, lay still<br/>and leaden as when first we entered it. The Hispaniola, in that<br/>unbroken mirror, was exactly portrayed from the truck to the<br/>waterline, the Jolly Roger hanging from her peak.<br/><br/>Alongside lay one of the gigs, Silver in the stern-sheets—him I<br/>could always recognize—while a couple of men were leaning over the<br/>stern bulwarks, one of them with a red cap—the very rogue that I<br/>had seen some hours before stride-legs upon the palisade.<br/>Apparently they were talking and laughing, though at that<br/>distance—upwards of a mile—I could, of course, hear no word of what<br/>was said. All at once there began the most horrid, unearthly<br/>screaming, which at first startled me badly, though I had soon<br/>remembered the voice of Captain Flint and even thought I could make<br/>out the bird by her bright plumage as she sat perched upon her<br/>master's wrist.<br/><br/>Soon after, the jolly-boat shoved off and pulled for shore, and<br/>the man with the red cap and his comrade went below by the cabin<br/>companion.<br/><br/>Just about the same time, the sun had gone down behind the<br/>Spy-glass, and as the fog was collecting rapidly, it began to grow<br/>dark in earnest. I saw I must lose no time if I were to find the<br/>boat that evening.<br/><br/>The white rock, visible enough above the brush, was still some<br/>eighth of a mile further down the spit, and it took me a goodish<br/>while to get up with it, crawling, often on all fours, among the<br/>scrub. Night had almost come when I laid my hand on its rough<br/>sides. Right below it there was an exceedingly small hollow of<br/>green turf, hidden by banks and a thick underwood about knee-deep,<br/>that grew there very plentifully; and in the centre of the dell,<br/>sure enough, a little tent of goat-skins, like what the gipsies<br/>carry about with them in England.<br/><br/>I dropped into the hollow, lifted the side of the tent, and<br/>there was Ben Gunn's boat—home-made if ever anything was home-made;<br/>a rude, lop-sided framework of tough wood, and stretched upon that<br/>a covering of goat-skin, with the hair inside. The thing was<br/>extremely small, even for me, and I can hardly imagine that it<br/>could have floated with a full-sized man. There was one thwart set<br/>as low as possible, a kind of stretcher in the bows, and a double<br/>paddle for propulsion.<br/><br/>I had not then seen a coracle, such as the ancient Britons made,<br/>but I have seen one since, and I can give you no fairer idea of Ben<br/>Gunn's boat than by saying it was like the first and the worst<br/>coracle ever made by man. But the great advantage of the coracle it<br/>certainly possessed, for it was exceedingly light and portable.<br/><br/>
