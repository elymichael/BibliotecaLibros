Now, the coxswain's hesitation seemed to be unnatural, and as<br/>for the notion of his preferring wine to brandy, I entirely<br/>disbelieved it. The whole story was a pretext. He wanted me to<br/>leave the deck—so much was plain; but with what purpose I could in<br/>no way imagine. His eyes never met mine; they kept wandering to and<br/>fro, up and down, now with a look to the sky, now with a flitting<br/>glance upon the dead O'Brien. All the time he kept smiling and<br/>putting his tongue out in the most guilty, embarrassed manner, so<br/>that a child could have told that he was bent on some deception. I<br/>was prompt with my answer, however, for I saw where my advantage<br/>lay and that with a fellow so densely stupid I could easily conceal<br/>my suspicions to the end. "Some wine?" I said. "Far better. Will<br/>you have white or red?"<br/><br/>"Well, I reckon it's about the blessed same to me, shipmate," he<br/>replied; "so it's strong, and plenty of it, what's the odds?" "All<br/>right," I answered. "I'll bring you port, Mr. Hands. But I'll have<br/>to dig for it."<br/><br/>With that I scuttled down the companion with all the noise I<br/>could, slipped off my shoes, ran quietly along the sparred gallery,<br/>mounted the forecastle ladder, and popped my head out of the fore<br/>companion. I knew he would not expect to see me there, yet I took<br/>every precaution possible, and certainly the worst of my suspicions<br/>proved too true.<br/><br/>He had risen from his position to his hands and knees, and<br/>though his leg obviously hurt him pretty sharply when he moved—for<br/>I could hear him stifle a groan—yet it was at a good, rattling rate<br/>that he trailed himself across the deck. In half a minute he had<br/>reached the port scuppers and picked, out of a coil of rope, a long<br/>knife, or rather a short dirk, discoloured to the hilt with blood.<br/>He looked upon it for a moment, thrusting forth his under jaw,<br/>tried the point upon his hand, and then, hastily concealing it in<br/>the bosom of his jacket, trundled back again into his old place<br/>against the bulwark.<br/><br/>This was all that I required to know. Israel could move about,<br/>he was now armed, and if he had been at so much trouble to get rid<br/>of me, it was plain that I was meant to be the victim. What he<br/>would do afterwards—whether he would try to crawl right across the<br/>island from North Inlet to the camp among the swamps or whether he<br/>would fire Long Tom, trusting that his own comrades might come<br/>first to help him—was, of course, more than I could say.<br/><br/>Yet I felt sure that I could trust him in one point, since in<br/>that our interests jumped together, and that was in the disposition<br/>of the schooner. We both desired to have her stranded safe enough,<br/>in a sheltered place, and so that, when the time came, she could be<br/>got off again with as little labour and danger as might be; and<br/>until that was done I considered that my life would certainly be<br/>spared.<br/><br/>While I was thus turning the business over in my mind, I had not<br/>been idle with my body. I had stolen back to the cabin, slipped<br/>once more into my shoes, and laid my hand at random on a bottle of<br/>wine, and now, with this for an excuse, I made my reappearance on<br/>the deck.<br/><br/>Hands lay as I had left him, all fallen together in a bundle and<br/>with his eyelids lowered as though he were too weak to bear the<br/>light. He looked up, however, at my coming, knocked the neck off<br/>the bottle like a man who had done the same thing often, and took a<br/>good swig, with his favourite toast of "Here's luck!" Then he lay<br/>quiet for a little, and then, pulling out a stick of tobacco,<br/>begged me to cut him a quid.<br/><br/>"Cut me a junk o' that," says he, "for I haven't no knife and<br/>hardly strength enough, so be as I had. Ah, Jim, Jim, I reckon I've<br/>missed stays! Cut me a quid, as'll likely be the last, lad, for I'm<br/>for my long home, and no mistake."<br/><br/>"Well," said I, "I'll cut you some tobacco, but if I was you and<br/>thought myself so badly, I would go to my prayers like a Christian<br/>man."<br/><br/>"Why?" said he. "Now, you tell me why."<br/>
