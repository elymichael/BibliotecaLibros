"Search him, some of you shirking lubbers, and the rest of you<br/>aloft and get the chest," he cried.<br/><br/>I could hear their feet rattling up our old stairs, so that the<br/>house must have shook with it. Promptly afterwards, fresh sounds of<br/>astonishment arose; the window of the captain's room was thrown<br/>open with a slam and a jingle of broken glass, and a man leaned out<br/>into the moonlight, head and shoulders, and addressed the blind<br/>beggar on the road below him.<br/><br/>"Pew," he cried, "they've been before us. Someone's turned the<br/>chest out alow and aloft."<br/><br/>"Is it there?" roared Pew.<br/><br/>"The money's there."<br/><br/>The blind man cursed the money.<br/><br/>"Flint's fist, I mean," he cried.<br/><br/>"We don't see it here nohow," returned the man.<br/><br/>"Here, you below there, is it on Bill?" cried the blind man<br/>again.<br/><br/>At that another fellow, probably him who had remained below to<br/>search the captain's body, came to the door of the inn. "Bill's<br/>been overhauled a'ready," said he; "nothin' left."<br/><br/>"It's these people of the inn—it's that boy. I wish I had put<br/>his eyes out!" cried the blind man, Pew. "There were no time<br/>ago—they had the door bolted when I tried it. Scatter, lads, and<br/>find 'em."<br/>
