Council of War


T
here was a great
rush of feet across the deck. I could hear people tumbling up from
the cabin and the forecastle, and slipping in an instant outside my
barrel, I dived behind the fore-sail, made a double towards the
stern, and came out upon the open deck in time to join Hunter and
Dr. Livesey in the rush for the weather bow.

There all hands were already congregated. A belt of fog had
lifted almost simultaneously with the appearance of the moon. Away
to the south-west of us we saw two low hills, about a couple of
miles apart, and rising behind one of them a third and higher hill,
whose peak was still buried in the fog. All three seemed sharp and
conical in figure.

So much I saw, almost in a dream, for I had not yet recovered
from my horrid fear of a minute or two before. And then I heard the
voice of Captain Smollett issuing orders. The Hispaniola was laid a
couple of points nearer the wind and now sailed a course that would
just clear the island on the east.

"And now, men," said the captain, when all was sheeted home,
"has any one of you ever seen that land ahead?"

"I have, sir," said Silver. "I've watered there with a trader I
was cook in."

"The anchorage is on the south, behind an islet, I fancy?" asked
the captain.
