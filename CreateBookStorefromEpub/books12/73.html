Another voice answered, and then the first voice, which I now<br/>recognized to be Silver's, once more took up the story and ran on<br/>for a long while in a stream, only now and again interrupted by the<br/>other. By the sound they must have been talking earnestly, and<br/>almost fiercely; but no distinct word came to my hearing.<br/><br/>At last the speakers seemed to have paused and perhaps to have<br/>sat down, for not only did they cease to draw any nearer, but the<br/>birds themselves began to grow more quiet and to settle again to<br/>their places in the swamp.<br/><br/>And now I began to feel that I was neglecting my business, that<br/>since I had been so foolhardy as to come ashore with these<br/>desperadoes, the least I could do was to overhear them at their<br/>councils, and that my plain and obvious duty was to draw as close<br/>as I could manage, under the favourable ambush of the crouching<br/>trees.<br/><br/>I could tell the direction of the speakers pretty exactly, not<br/>only by the sound of their voices but by the behaviour of the few<br/>birds that still hung in alarm above the heads of the<br/>intruders.<br/><br/>Crawling on all fours, I made steadily but slowly towards them,<br/>till at last, raising my head to an aperture among the leaves, I<br/>could see clear down into a little green dell beside the marsh, and<br/>closely set about with trees, where Long John Silver and another of<br/>the crew stood face to face in conversation.<br/><br/>The sun beat full upon them. Silver had thrown his hat beside<br/>him on the ground, and his great, smooth, blond face, all shining<br/>with heat, was lifted to the other man's in a kind of appeal.<br/><br/>"Mate," he was saying, "it's because I thinks gold dust of<br/>you—gold dust, and you may lay to that! If I hadn't took to you<br/>like pitch, do you think I'd have been here a-warning of you? All's<br/>up—you can't make nor mend; it's to save your neck that I'm<br/>a-speaking, and if one of the wild uns knew it, where'd I be,<br/>Tom—now, tell me, where'd I be?"<br/><br/>"Silver," said the other man—and I observed he was not only red<br/>in the face, but spoke as hoarse as a crow, and his voice shook<br/>too, like a taut rope—"Silver," says he, "you're old, and you're<br/>honest, or has the name for it; and you've money too, which lots of<br/>poor sailors hasn't; and you're brave, or I'm mistook. And will you<br/>tell me you'll let yourself be led away with that kind of a mess of<br/>swabs? Not you! As sure as God sees me, I'd sooner lose my hand. If<br/>I turn agin my dooty—"<br/><br/>And then all of a sudden he was interrupted by a noise. I had<br/>found one of the honest hands—well, here, at that same moment, came<br/>news of another. Far away out in the marsh there arose, all of a<br/>sudden, a sound like the cry of anger, then another on the back of<br/>it; and then one horrid, long-drawn scream. The rocks of the<br/>Spy-glass re-echoed it a score of times; the whole troop of<br/>marsh-birds rose again, darkening heaven, with a simultaneous<br/>whirr; and long after that death yell was still ringing in my<br/>brain, silence had re-established its empire, and only the rustle<br/>of the redescending birds and the boom of the distant surges<br/>disturbed the languor of the afternoon.<br/><br/>Tom had leaped at the sound, like a horse at the spur, but<br/>Silver had not winked an eye. He stood where he was, resting<br/>lightly on his crutch, watching his companion like a snake about to<br/>spring.<br/><br/>"John!" said the sailor, stretching out his hand.<br/>
