This argument seemed weak enough to me. But you can never tell<br/>what will affect the superstitious, and to my wonder, George Merry<br/>was greatly relieved.<br/><br/>"Well, that's so," he said. "You've a head upon your shoulders,<br/>John, and no mistake. 'Bout ship, mates! This here crew is on a<br/>wrong tack, I do believe. And come to think on it, it was like<br/>Flint's voice, I grant you, but not just so clear-away like it,<br/>after all. It was liker somebody else's voice now—it was<br/>liker—"<br/><br/>"By the powers, Ben Gunn!" roared Silver.<br/><br/>"Aye, and so it were," cried Morgan, springing on his knees.<br/>"Ben Gunn it were!"<br/><br/>"It don't make much odds, do it, now?" asked Dick. "Ben Gunn's<br/>not here in the body any more'n Flint."<br/><br/>But the older hands greeted this remark with scorn.<br/><br/>"Why, nobody minds Ben Gunn," cried Merry; "dead or alive,<br/>nobody minds him."<br/><br/>It was extraordinary how their spirits had returned and how the<br/>natural colour had revived in their faces. Soon they were chatting<br/>together, with intervals of listening; and not long after, hearing<br/>no further sound, they shouldered the tools and set forth again,<br/>Merry walking first with Silver's compass to keep them on the right<br/>line with Skeleton Island. He had said the truth: dead or alive,<br/>nobody minded Ben Gunn.<br/><br/>Dick alone still held his Bible, and looked around him as he<br/>went, with fearful glances; but he found no sympathy, and Silver<br/>even joked him on his precautions.<br/><br/>"I told you," said he—"I told you you had sp'iled your Bible. If<br/>it ain't no good to swear by, what do you suppose a sperrit would<br/>give for it? Not that!" and he snapped his big fingers, halting a<br/>moment on his crutch.<br/><br/>But Dick was not to be comforted; indeed, it was soon plain to<br/>me that the lad was falling sick; hastened by heat, exhaustion, and<br/>the shock of his alarm, the fever, predicted by Dr. Livesey, was<br/>evidently growing swiftly higher.<br/>
