Just then, with a roar and a whistle, a round-shot passed high<br/>above the roof of the log-house and plumped far beyond us in the<br/>wood.<br/><br/>"Oho!" said the captain. "Blaze away! You've little enough<br/>powder already, my lads."<br/><br/>At the second trial, the aim was better, and the ball descended<br/>inside the stockade, scattering a cloud of sand but doing no<br/>further damage.<br/><br/>"Captain," said the squire, "the house is quite invisible from<br/>the ship. It must be the flag they are aiming at. Would it not be<br/>wiser to take it in?"<br/><br/>"Strike my colours!" cried the captain.

Well armed, they<br/>stole out of the stockade, but it proved a useless mission. The<br/>mutineers were bolder than we fancied or they put more trust in<br/>Israel's gunnery. For four or five of them were busy carrying off<br/>our stores and wading out with them to one of the gigs that lay<br/>close by, pulling an oar or so to hold her steady against the<br/>current. Silver was in the stern-sheets in command; and every man<br/>of them was now provided with a musket from some secret magazine of<br/>their own.<br/><br/>The captain sat down to his log, and here is the beginning of<br/>the entry:<br/><br/><br/>Alexander Smollett, master;<br/><br/>
