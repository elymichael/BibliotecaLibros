"That's as may be," replied the captain.<br/><br/>"Oh, well, you have, I know that," returned Long John. "You<br/>needn't be so husky with a man; there ain't a particle of service<br/>in that, and you may lay to it. What I mean is, we want your chart.<br/>Now, I never meant you no harm, myself."<br/><br/>"That won't do with me, my man," interrupted the captain. "We<br/>know exactly what you meant to do, and we don't care, for now, you<br/>see, you can't do it."<br/><br/>And the captain looked at him calmly and proceeded to fill a<br/>pipe.<br/><br/>"If Abe Gray—" Silver broke out.<br/><br/>"Avast there!" cried Mr. Smollett. "Gray told me nothing, and I<br/>asked him nothing; and what's more, I would see you and him and<br/>this whole island blown clean out of the water into blazes first.<br/>So there's my mind for you, my man, on that."<br/><br/>This little whiff of temper seemed to cool Silver down. He had<br/>been growing nettled before, but now he pulled himself together.<br/>"Like enough," said he. "I would set no limits to what gentlemen<br/>might consider shipshape, or might not, as the case were. And<br/>seein' as how you are about to take a pipe, cap'n, I'll make so<br/>free as do likewise."<br/><br/>And he filled a pipe and lighted it; and the two men sat<br/>silently smoking for quite a while, now looking each other in the<br/>face, now stopping their tobacco, now leaning forward to spit. It<br/>was as good as the play to see them.<br/><br/>"Now," resumed Silver, "here it is. You give us the chart to get<br/>the treasure by, and drop shooting poor seamen and stoving of their<br/>heads in while asleep. You do that, and we'll offer you a choice.<br/>Either you come aboard along of us, once the treasure shipped, and<br/>then I'll give you my affy-davy, upon my word of honour, to clap<br/>you somewhere safe ashore. Or if that ain't to your fancy, some of<br/>my hands being rough and having old scores on account of hazing,<br/>then you can stay here, you can. We'll divide stores with you, man<br/>for man; and I'll give my affy-davy, as before to speak the first<br/>ship I sight, and send 'em here to pick you up. Now, you'll own<br/>that's talking. Handsomer you couldn't look to get, now you. And I<br/>hope"—raising his voice—"that all hands in this here block house<br/>will overhaul my words, for what is spoke to one is spoke to<br/>all."<br/><br/>Captain Smollett rose from his seat and knocked out the ashes of<br/>his pipe in the palm of his left hand.<br/><br/>"Is that all?" he asked.<br/>
