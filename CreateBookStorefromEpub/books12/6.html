"Well, then," said he, "this is the berth for me. Here you,<br/>matey," he cried to the man who trundled the barrow; "bring up<br/>alongside and help up my chest. I'll stay here a bit," he<br/>continued. "I'm a plain man; rum and bacon and eggs is what I want,<br/>and that head up there for to watch ships off. What you mought call<br/>me? You mought call me captain. Oh, I see what you're at—there";<br/>and he threw down three or four gold pieces on the threshold. "You<br/>can tell me when I've worked through that," says he, looking as<br/>fierce as a commander.<br/><br/>And indeed bad as his clothes were and coarsely as he spoke, he<br/>had none of the appearance of a man who sailed before the mast, but<br/>seemed like a mate or skipper accustomed to be obeyed or to strike.<br/>The man who came with the barrow told us the mail had set him down<br/>the morning before at the Royal George, that he had inquired what<br/>inns there were along the coast, and hearing ours well spoken of, I<br/>suppose, and described as lonely, had chosen it from the others for<br/>his place of residence. And that was all we could learn of our<br/>guest.<br/><br/>He was a very silent man by custom. All day he hung round the<br/>cove or upon the cliffs with a brass telescope; all evening he sat<br/>in a corner of the parlour next the fire and drank rum and water<br/>very strong. Mostly he would not speak when spoken to, only look up<br/>sudden and fierce and blow through his nose like a fog-horn; and we<br/>and the people who came about our house soon learned to let him be.<br/>Every day when he came back from his stroll he would ask if any<br/>seafaring men had gone by along the road. At first we thought it<br/>was the want of company of his own kind that made him ask this<br/>question, but at last we began to see he was desirous to avoid<br/>them. When a seaman did put up at the Admiral Benbow (as now and<br/>then some did, making by the coast road for Bristol) he would look<br/>in at him through the curtained door before he entered the parlour;<br/>and he was always sure to be as silent as a mouse when any such was<br/>present. For me, at least, there was no secret about the matter,<br/>for I was, in a way, a sharer in his alarms. He had taken me aside<br/>one day and promised me a silver fourpenny on the first of every<br/>month if I would only keep my "weather-eye open for a seafaring man<br/>with one leg" and let him know the moment he appeared. Often enough<br/>when the first of the month came round and I applied to him for my<br/>wage, he would only blow through his nose at me and stare me down,<br/>but before the week was out he was sure to think better of it,<br/>bring me my four-penny piece, and repeat his orders to look out for<br/>"the seafaring man with one leg."<br/><br/>How that personage haunted my dreams, I need scarcely tell you.<br/>On stormy nights, when the wind shook the four corners of the house<br/>and the surf roared along the cove and up the cliffs, I would see<br/>him in a thousand forms, and with a thousand diabolical<br/>expressions. Now the leg would be cut off at the knee, now at the<br/>hip; now he was a monstrous kind of a creature who had never had<br/>but the one leg, and that in the middle of his body. To see him<br/>leap and run and pursue me over hedge and ditch was the worst of<br/>nightmares. And altogether I paid pretty dear for my monthly<br/>fourpenny piece, in the shape of these abominable fancies.<br/><br/>But though I was so terrified by the idea of the seafaring man<br/>with one leg, I was far less afraid of the captain himself than<br/>anybody else who knew him. There were nights when he took a deal<br/>more rum and water than his head would carry; and then he would<br/>sometimes sit and sing his wicked, old, wild sea-songs, minding<br/>nobody; but sometimes he would call for glasses round and force all<br/>the trembling company to listen to his stories or bear a chorus to<br/>his singing. Often I have heard the house shaking with "Yo-ho-ho,<br/>and a bottle of rum," all the neighbours joining in for dear life,<br/>with the fear of death upon them, and each singing louder than the<br/>other to avoid remark. For in these fits he was the most overriding<br/>companion ever known; he would slap his hand on the table for<br/>silence all round; he would fly up in a passion of anger at a<br/>question, or sometimes because none was put, and so he judged the<br/>company was not following his story. Nor would he allow anyone to<br/>leave the inn till he had drunk himself sleepy and reeled off to<br/>bed.<br/><br/>His stories were what frightened people worst of all. Dreadful<br/>stories they were—about hanging, and walking the plank, and storms<br/>at sea, and the Dry Tortugas, and wild deeds and places on the<br/>Spanish Main. By his own account he must have lived his life among<br/>some of the wickedest men that God ever allowed upon the sea, and<br/>the language in which he told these stories shocked our plain<br/>country people almost as much as the crimes that he described. My<br/>father was always saying the inn would be ruined, for people would<br/>soon cease coming there to be tyrannized over and put down, and<br/>sent shivering to their beds; but I really believe his presence did<br/>us good. People were frightened at the time, but on looking back<br/>they rather liked it; it was a fine excitement in a quiet country<br/>life, and there was even a party of the younger men who pretended<br/>to admire him, calling him a "true sea-dog" and a "real old salt"<br/>and such like names, and saying there was the sort of man that made<br/>England terrible at sea.<br/><br/>In one way, indeed, he bade fair to ruin us, for he kept on<br/>staying week after week, and at last month after month, so that all<br/>the money had been long exhausted, and still my father never<br/>plucked up the heart to insist on having more. If ever he mentioned<br/>it, the captain blew through his nose so loudly that you might say<br/>he roared, and stared my poor father out of the room. I have seen<br/>him wringing his hands after such a rebuff, and I am sure the<br/>annoyance and the terror he lived in must have greatly hastened his<br/>early and unhappy death.<br/><br/>All the time he lived with us the captain made no change<br/>whatever in his dress but to buy some stockings from a hawker. One<br/>of the cocks of his hat having fallen down, he let it hang from<br/>that day forth, though it was a great annoyance when it blew. I<br/>remember the appearance of his coat, which he patched himself<br/>upstairs in his room, and which, before the end, was nothing but<br/>patches. He never wrote or received a letter, and he never spoke<br/>with any but the neighbours, and with these, for the most part,<br/>only when drunk on rum. The great sea-chest none of us had ever<br/>seen open.<br/><br/>He was only once crossed, and that was towards the end, when my<br/>poor father was far gone in a decline that took him off. Dr.<br/>Livesey came late one afternoon to see the patient, took a bit of<br/>dinner from my mother, and went into the parlour to smoke a pipe<br/>until his horse should come down from the hamlet, for we had no<br/>stabling at the old Benbow. I followed him in, and I remember<br/>observing the contrast the neat, bright doctor, with his powder as<br/>white as snow and his bright, black eyes and pleasant manners, made<br/>with the coltish country folk, and above all, with that filthy,<br/>heavy, bleared scarecrow of a pirate of ours, sitting, far gone in<br/>rum, with his arms on the table. Suddenly he—the captain, that<br/>is—began to pipe up his eternal song:<br/><br/><br/>"Fifteen men on the dead man's chest—<br/><br/>
