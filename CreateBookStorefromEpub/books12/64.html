<br/>And with that he turned on his heel and rejoined the other two.<br/>They spoke together for a little, and though none of them started,<br/>or raised his voice, or so much as whistled, it was plain enough<br/>that Dr. Livesey had communicated my request, for the next thing<br/>that I heard was the captain giving an order to Job Anderson, and<br/>all hands were piped on deck.<br/><br/>"My lads," said Captain Smollett, "I've a word to say to you.<br/>This land that we have sighted is the place we have been sailing<br/>for. Mr. Trelawney, being a very open-handed gentleman, as we all<br/>know, has just asked me a word or two, and as I was able to tell<br/>him that every man on board had done his duty, alow and aloft, as I<br/>never ask to see it done better, why, he and I and the doctor are<br/>going below to the cabin to drink your health and luck, and you'll<br/>have grog served out for you to drink our health and luck. I'll<br/>tell you what I think of this: I think it handsome. And if you<br/>think as I do, you'll give a good sea-cheer for the gentleman that<br/>does it."<br/><br/>The cheer followedâ€”that was a matter of course; but it rang out<br/>so full and hearty that I confess I could hardly believe these same<br/>men were plotting for our blood.<br/><br/>"One more cheer for Cap'n Smollett," cried Long John when the<br/>first had subsided.<br/><br/>And this also was given with a will.<br/><br/>On the top of that the three gentlemen went below, and not long<br/>after, word was sent forward that Jim Hawkins was wanted in the<br/>cabin.<br/><br/>I found them all three seated round the table, a bottle of<br/>Spanish wine and some raisins before them, and the doctor smoking<br/>away, with his wig on his lap, and that, I knew, was a sign that he<br/>was agitated. The stern window was open, for it was a warm night,<br/>and you could see the moon shining behind on the ship's wake.<br/><br/>"Now, Hawkins," said the squire, "you have something to say.<br/>Speak up."<br/><br/>I did as I was bid, and as short as I could make it, told the<br/>whole details of Silver's conversation. Nobody interrupted me till<br/>I was done, nor did any one of the three of them make so much as a<br/>movement, but they kept their eyes upon my face from first to<br/>last.<br/><br/>"Jim," said Dr. Livesey, "take a seat."<br/><br/>
