At every jump of the schooner, red-cap slipped to and fro,<br/>but—what was ghastly to behold—neither his attitude nor his fixed<br/>teeth-disclosing grin was anyway disturbed by this rough usage. At<br/>every jump too, Hands appeared still more to sink into himself and<br/>settle down upon the deck, his feet sliding ever the farther out,<br/>and the whole body canting towards the stern, so that his face<br/>became, little by little, hid from me; and at last I could see<br/>nothing beyond his ear and the frayed ringlet of one whisker.<br/><br/>At the same time, I observed, around both of them, splashes of<br/>dark blood upon the planks and began to feel sure that they had<br/>killed each other in their drunken wrath.<br/><br/>While I was thus looking and wondering, in a calm moment, when<br/>the ship was still, Israel Hands turned partly round and with a low<br/>moan writhed himself back to the position in which I had seen him<br/>first. The moan, which told of pain and deadly weakness, and the<br/>way in which his jaw hung open went right to my heart. But when I<br/>remembered the talk I had overheard from the apple barrel, all pity<br/>left me.<br/><br/>I walked aft until I reached the main-mast.<br/><br/>"Come aboard, Mr. Hands," I said ironically.<br/><br/>He rolled his eyes round heavily, but he was too far gone to<br/>express surprise. All he could do was to utter one word,<br/>"Brandy."<br/><br/>It occurred to me there was no time to lose, and dodging the<br/>boom as it once more lurched across the deck, I slipped aft and<br/>down the companion stairs into the cabin.<br/><br/>It was such a scene of confusion as you can hardly fancy. All<br/>the lockfast places had been broken open in quest of the chart. The<br/>floor was thick with mud where ruffians had sat down to drink or<br/>consult after wading in the marshes round their camp. The<br/>bulkheads, all painted in clear white and beaded round with gilt,<br/>bore a pattern of dirty hands. Dozens of empty bottles clinked<br/>together in corners to the rolling of the ship. One of the doctor's<br/>medical books lay open on the table, half of the leaves gutted out,<br/>I suppose, for pipelights. In the midst of all this the lamp still<br/>cast a smoky glow, obscure and brown as umber.<br/><br/>I went into the cellar; all the barrels were gone, and of the<br/>bottles a most surprising number had been drunk out and thrown<br/>away. Certainly, since the mutiny began, not a man of them could<br/>ever have been sober.<br/><br/>Foraging about, I found a bottle with some brandy left, for<br/>Hands; and for myself I routed out some biscuit, some pickled<br/>fruits, a great bunch of raisins, and a piece of cheese. With these<br/>I came on deck, put down my own stock behind the rudder head and<br/>well out of the coxswain's reach, went forward to the<br/>water-breaker, and had a good deep drink of water, and then, and<br/>not till then, gave Hands the brandy.<br/><br/>He must have drunk a gill before he took the bottle from his<br/>mouth.<br/>
