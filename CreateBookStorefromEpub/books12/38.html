Well, sir, I thought I had only found a cook,&#160;but it was a<br/>crew I had discovered. Between&#160;Silver and myself we got<br/>together in a few days a&#160;company of the toughest old salts<br/>imaginable—not&#160;pretty to look at, but fellows, by their faces,<br/>of&#160;the most indomitable spirit. I declare we could&#160;fight<br/>a frigate.&#160;Long John even got rid of two out of the<br/>six&#160;or seven I had already engaged. He showed me in<br/>a&#160;moment that they were just the sort of<br/>fresh-water&#160;swabs we had to fear in an adventure of<br/><br/>importance.<br/><br/>I am in the most magnificent health and&#160;spirits, eating<br/>like a bull, sleeping like a tree,&#160;yet I shall not enjoy a<br/>moment till I hear my old&#160;tarpaulins tramping round the<br/>capstan. Seaward,&#160;ho! Hang the treasure! It's the glory of the<br/>sea&#160;that has turned my head. So now, Livesey, come&#160;post;<br/>do not lose an hour, if you respect me.<br/><br/>Let young Hawkins go at once to see his&#160;mother, with<br/>Redruth for a guard; and then both&#160;come full speed to<br/>Bristol.<br/><br/>John Trelawney<br/><br/>Postscript—I did not tell you that Blandly,&#160;who, by the<br/>way, is to send a consort after us if&#160;we don't turn up by the<br/>end of August, had found&#160;an admirable fellow for sailing<br/>master—a stiff&#160;man, which I regret, but in all other respects<br/>a&#160;treasure. Long John Silver unearthed a very&#160;competent<br/>man for a mate, a man named Arrow. I&#160;have a boatswain who<br/>pipes, Livesey; so things&#160;shall go man-o'-war fashion on board<br/>the good ship&#160;Hispaniola.<br/><br/>I forgot to tell you that Silver is a man of&#160;substance; I<br/>know of my own knowledge that he has&#160;a banker's account, which<br/>has never been&#160;overdrawn. He leaves his wife to manage the<br/>inn;&#160;and as she is a woman of colour, a pair of<br/>old&#160;bachelors like you and I may be excused for&#160;guessing<br/>that it is the wife, quite as much as the&#160;health, that sends<br/>him back to roving.<br/><br/>J. T.<br/><br/>P.P.S.—Hawkins may stay one night with his&#160;mother.<br/><br/>J. T.<br/><br/><br/>
