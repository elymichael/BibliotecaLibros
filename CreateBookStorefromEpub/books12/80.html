<br/>"Why," I cried, "the squire's a gentleman. And besides, if we<br/>got rid of the others, we should want you to help work the vessel<br/>home."<br/><br/>"Ah," said he, "so you would." And he seemed very much<br/>relieved.<br/><br/>"Now, I'll tell you what," he went on. "So much I'll tell you,<br/>and no more. I were in Flint's ship when he buried the treasure; he<br/>and six along—six strong seamen. They was ashore nigh on a week,<br/>and us standing off and on in the old Walrus. One fine day up went<br/>the signal, and here come Flint by himself in a little boat, and<br/>his head done up in a blue scarf. The sun was getting up, and<br/>mortal white he looked about the cutwater. But, there he was, you<br/>mind, and the six all dead—dead and buried. How he done it, not a<br/>man aboard us could make out. It was battle, murder, and sudden<br/>death, leastways—him against six. Billy Bones was the mate; Long<br/>John, he was quartermaster; and they asked him where the treasure<br/>was. 'Ah,' says he, 'you can go ashore, if you like, and stay,' he<br/>says; 'but as for the ship, she'll beat up for more, by thunder!'<br/>That's what he said.<br/><br/>"Well, I was in another ship three years back, and we sighted<br/>this island. 'Boys,' said I, 'here's Flint's treasure; let's land<br/>and find it.' The cap'n was displeased at that, but my messmates<br/>were all of a mind and landed. Twelve days they looked for it, and<br/>every day they had the worse word for me, until one fine morning<br/>all hands went aboard. 'As for you, Benjamin Gunn,' says they,<br/>'here's a musket,' they says, 'and a spade, and pick-axe. You can<br/>stay here and find Flint's money for yourself,' they says.<br/><br/>"Well, Jim, three years have I been here, and not a bite of<br/>Christian diet from that day to this. But now, you look here; look<br/>at me. Do I look like a man before the mast? No, says you. Nor I<br/>weren't, neither, I says."<br/><br/>And with that he winked and pinched me hard.<br/><br/>"Just you mention them words to your squire, Jim," he went on.<br/>"Nor he weren't, neither—that's the words. Three years he were the<br/>man of this island, light and dark, fair and rain; and sometimes he<br/>would maybe think upon a prayer (says you), and sometimes he would<br/>maybe think of his old mother, so be as she's alive (you'll say);<br/>but the most part of Gunn's time (this is what you'll say)—the most<br/>part of his time was took up with another matter. And then you'll<br/>give him a nip, like I do."<br/><br/>And he pinched me again in the most confidential manner.<br/><br/>"Then," he continued, "then you'll up, and you'll say this: Gunn<br/>is a good man (you'll say), and he puts a precious sight more<br/>confidence—a precious sight, mind that—in a gen'leman born than in<br/>these gen'leman of fortune, having been one hisself."<br/><br/>"Well," I said, "I don't understand one word that you've been<br/>saying. But that's neither here nor there; for how am I to get on<br/>board?"<br/><br/>
