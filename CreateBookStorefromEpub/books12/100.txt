At length I thought I might return towards the stockade. I was
pretty far down on the low, sandy spit that encloses the anchorage
to the east, and is joined at half-water to Skeleton Island; and
now, as I rose to my feet, I saw, some distance further down the
spit and rising from among low bushes, an isolated rock, pretty
high, and peculiarly white in colour. It occurred to me that this
might be the white rock of which Ben Gunn had spoken and that some
day or other a boat might be wanted and I should know where to look
for one.

Then I skirted among the woods until I had regained the rear, or
shoreward side, of the stockade, and was soon warmly welcomed by
the faithful party.

I had soon told my story and began to look about me. The
log-house was made of unsquared trunks of pine—roof, walls, and
floor. The latter stood in several places as much as a foot or a
foot and a half above the surface of the sand. There was a porch at
the door, and under this porch the little spring welled up into an
artificial basin of a rather odd kind—no other than a great ship's
kettle of iron, with the bottom knocked out, and sunk "to her
bearings," as the captain said, among the sand.

Little had been left besides the framework of the house, but in
one corner there was a stone slab laid down by way of hearth and an
old rusty iron basket to contain the fire.

The slopes of the knoll and all the inside of the stockade had
been cleared of timber to build the house, and we could see by the
stumps what a fine and lofty grove had been destroyed. Most of the
soil had been washed away or buried in drift after the removal of
the trees; only where the streamlet ran down from the kettle a
thick bed of moss and some ferns and little creeping bushes were
still green among the sand. Very close around the stockade—too
close for defence, they said—the wood still flourished high and
dense, all of fir on the land side, but towards the sea with a
large admixture of live-oaks.

The cold evening breeze, of which I have spoken, whistled
through every chink of the rude building and sprinkled the floor
with a continual rain of fine sand. There was sand in our eyes,
sand in our teeth, sand in our suppers, sand dancing in the spring
at the bottom of the kettle, for all the world like porridge
beginning to boil. Our chimney was a square hole in the roof; it
was but a little part of the smoke that found its way out, and the
rest eddied about the house and kept us coughing and piping the
eye.

Add to this that Gray, the new man, had his face tied up in a
bandage for a cut he had got in breaking away from the mutineers
and that poor old Tom Redruth, still unburied, lay along the wall,
stiff and stark, under the Union Jack.

If we had been allowed to sit idle, we should all have fallen in
the blues, but Captain Smollett was never the man for that. All
hands were called up before him, and he divided us into watches.
The doctor and Gray and I for one; the squire, Hunter, and Joyce
upon the other. Tired though we all were, two were sent out for
firewood; two more were set to dig a grave for Redruth; the doctor
was named cook; I was put sentry at the door; and the captain
himself went from one to another, keeping up our spirits and
lending a hand wherever it was wanted.

From time to time the doctor came to the door for a little air
and to rest his eyes, which were almost smoked out of his head, and
whenever he did so, he had a word for me.

"That man Smollett," he said once, "is a better man than I am.
And when I say that it means a deal, Jim."
