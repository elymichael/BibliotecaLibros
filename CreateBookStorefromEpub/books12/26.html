<br/>"Sure enough, they left their glim here," said the fellow from<br/>the window.<br/><br/>"Scatter and find 'em! Rout the house out!" reiterated Pew,<br/>striking with his stick upon the road.<br/><br/>Then there followed a great to-do through all our old inn, heavy<br/>feet pounding to and fro, furniture thrown over, doors kicked in,<br/>until the very rocks re-echoed and the men came out again, one<br/>after another, on the road and declared that we were nowhere to be<br/>found. And just the same whistle that had alarmed my mother and<br/>myself over the dead captain's money was once more clearly audible<br/>through the night, but this time twice repeated. I had thought it<br/>to be the blind man's trumpet, so to speak, summoning his crew to<br/>the assault, but I now found that it was a signal from the hillside<br/>towards the hamlet, and from its effect upon the buccaneers, a<br/>signal to warn them of approaching danger.<br/><br/>"There's Dirk again," said one. "Twice! We'll have to budge,<br/>mates."<br/><br/>"Budge, you skulk!" cried Pew. "Dirk was a fool and a coward<br/>from the first—you wouldn't mind him. They must be close by; they<br/>can't be far; you have your hands on it. Scatter and look for them,<br/>dogs! Oh, shiver my soul," he cried, "if I had eyes!" This appeal<br/>seemed to produce some effect, for two of the fellows began to look<br/>here and there among the lumber, but half-heartedly, I thought, and<br/>with half an eye to their own danger all the time, while the rest<br/>stood irresolute on the road. "You have your hands on thousands,<br/>you fools, and you hang a leg! You'd be as rich as kings if you<br/>could find it, and you know it's here, and you stand there<br/>skulking. There wasn't one of you dared face Bill, and I did it—a<br/>blind man! And I'm to lose my chance for you! I'm to be a poor,<br/>crawling beggar, sponging for rum, when I might be rolling in a<br/>coach! If you had the pluck of a weevil in a biscuit you would<br/>catch them still."<br/><br/>"Hang it, Pew, we've got the doubloons!" grumbled one.<br/><br/>"They might have hid the blessed thing," said another. "Take the<br/>Georges, Pew, and don't stand here squalling."<br/><br/>Squalling was the word for it; Pew's anger rose so high at these<br/>objections till at last, his passion completely taking the upper<br/>hand, he struck at them right and left in his blindness and his<br/>stick sounded heavily on more than one.<br/><br/>These, in their turn, cursed back at the blind miscreant,<br/>threatened him in horrid terms, and tried in vain to catch the<br/>stick and wrest it from his grasp.<br/><br/>This quarrel was the saving of us, for while it was still<br/>raging, another sound came from the top of the hill on the side of<br/>the hamlet—the tramp of horses galloping. Almost at the same time a<br/>pistol-shot, flash and report, came from the hedge side. And that<br/>was plainly the last signal of danger, for the buccaneers turned at<br/>once and ran, separating in every direction, one seaward along the<br/>cove, one slant across the hill, and so on, so that in half a<br/>minute not a sign of them remained but Pew. Him they had deserted,<br/>whether in sheer panic or out of revenge for his ill words and<br/>blows I know not; but there he remained behind, tapping up and down<br/>the road in a frenzy, and groping and calling for his comrades.<br/>Finally he took a wrong turn and ran a few steps past me, towards<br/>the hamlet, crying, "Johnny, Black Dog, Dirk," and other names,<br/>"you won't leave old Pew, mates—not old Pew!"<br/><br/>
