<br/>"And now, squire," said the doctor.<br/><br/>"And now, Livesey," said the squire in the same breath.<br/><br/>"One at a time, one at a time," laughed Dr. Livesey. "You have<br/>heard of this Flint, I suppose?"<br/><br/>"Heard of him!" cried the squire. "Heard of him, you say! He was<br/>the bloodthirstiest buccaneer that sailed. Blackbeard was a child<br/>to Flint. The Spaniards were so prodigiously afraid of him that, I<br/>tell you, sir, I was sometimes proud he was an Englishman. I've<br/>seen his top-sails with these eyes, off Trinidad, and the cowardly<br/>son of a rum-puncheon that I sailed with put back—put back, sir,<br/>into Port of Spain."<br/><br/>"Well, I've heard of him myself, in England," said the doctor.<br/>"But the point is, had he money?"<br/><br/>"Money!" cried the squire.

What do they care for but money?<br/>For what would they risk their rascal carcasses but money?"<br/><br/>"That we shall soon know," replied the doctor. "But you are so<br/>confoundedly hot-headed and exclamatory that I cannot get a word<br/>in. What I want to know is this: Supposing that I have here in my<br/>pocket some clue to where Flint buried his treasure, will that<br/>treasure amount to much?"<br/><br/>"Amount, sir!" cried the squire. "It will amount to this: If we<br/>have the clue you talk about, I fit out a ship in Bristol dock, and<br/>take you and Hawkins here along, and I'll have that treasure if I<br/>search a year."<br/><br/>"Very well," said the doctor. "Now, then, if Jim is agreeable,<br/>we'll open the packet"; and he laid it before him on the table.<br/><br/>The bundle was sewn together, and the doctor had to get out his<br/>instrument case and cut the stitches with his medical scissors. It<br/>contained two things—a book and a sealed paper.<br/><br/>
