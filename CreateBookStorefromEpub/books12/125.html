I remembered what Silver had said about the current that sets<br/>northward along the whole west coast of Treasure Island, and seeing<br/>from my position that I was already under its influence, I<br/>preferred to leave Haulbowline Head behind me and reserve my<br/>strength for an attempt to land upon the kindlier-looking Cape of<br/>the Woods.<br/><br/>There was a great, smooth swell upon the sea. The wind blowing<br/>steady and gentle from the south, there was no contrariety between<br/>that and the current, and the billows rose and fell unbroken.<br/><br/>Had it been otherwise, I must long ago have perished; but as it<br/>was, it is surprising how easily and securely my little and light<br/>boat could ride. Often, as I still lay at the bottom and kept no<br/>more than an eye above the gunwale, I would see a big blue summit<br/>heaving close above me; yet the coracle would but bounce a little,<br/>dance as if on springs, and subside on the other side into the<br/>trough as lightly as a bird.<br/><br/>I began after a little to grow very bold and sat up to try my<br/>skill at paddling. But even a small change in the disposition of<br/>the weight will produce violent changes in the behaviour of a<br/>coracle. And I had hardly moved before the boat, giving up at once<br/>her gentle dancing movement, ran straight down a slope of water so<br/>steep that it made me giddy, and struck her nose, with a spout of<br/>spray, deep into the side of the next wave.<br/><br/>I was drenched and terrified, and fell instantly back into my<br/>old position, whereupon the coracle seemed to find her head again<br/>and led me as softly as before among the billows. It was plain she<br/>was not to be interfered with, and at that rate, since I could in<br/>no way influence her course, what hope had I left of reaching<br/>land?<br/><br/>I began to be horribly frightened, but I kept my head, for all<br/>that. First, moving with all care, I gradually baled out the<br/>coracle with my sea-cap; then, getting my eye once more above the<br/>gunwale, I set myself to study how it was she managed to slip so<br/>quietly through the rollers.<br/><br/>I found each wave, instead of the big, smooth glossy mountain it<br/>looks from shore or from a vessel's deck, was for all the world<br/>like any range of hills on dry land, full of peaks and smooth<br/>places and valleys. The coracle, left to herself, turning from side<br/>to side, threaded, so to speak, her way through these lower parts<br/>and avoided the steep slopes and higher, toppling summits of the<br/>wave.<br/><br/>"Well, now," thought I to myself, "it is plain I must lie where<br/>I am and not disturb the balance; but it is plain also that I can<br/>put the paddle over the side and from time to time, in smooth<br/>places, give her a shove or two towards land." No sooner thought<br/>upon than done. There I lay on my elbows in the most trying<br/>attitude, and every now and again gave a weak stroke or two to turn<br/>her head to shore.<br/><br/>It was very tiring and slow work, yet I did visibly gain ground;<br/>and as we drew near the Cape of the Woods, though I saw I must<br/>infallibly miss that point, I had still made some hundred yards of<br/>easting. I was, indeed, close in. I could see the cool green<br/>tree-tops swaying together in the breeze, and I felt sure I should<br/>make the next promontory without fail.<br/><br/>It was high time, for I now began to be tortured with thirst.<br/>The glow of the sun from above, its thousandfold reflection from<br/>the waves, the sea-water that fell and dried upon me, caking my<br/>very lips with salt, combined to make my throat burn and my brain<br/>ache. The sight of the trees so near at hand had almost made me<br/>sick with longing, but the current had soon carried me past the<br/>point, and as the next reach of sea opened out, I beheld a sight<br/>that changed the nature of my thoughts.<br/><br/>Right in front of me, not half a mile away, I beheld the<br/>Hispaniola under sail. I made sure, of course, that I should be<br/>taken; but I was so distressed for want of water that I scarce knew<br/>whether to be glad or sorry at the thought, and long before I had<br/>come to a conclusion, surprise had taken entire possession of my<br/>mind and I could do nothing but stare and wonder.<br/>
