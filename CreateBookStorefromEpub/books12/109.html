<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>6<br/>The Attack<br/><br/><br/>A<br/>s soon as Silver<br/>disappeared, the captain, who had been closely watching him, turned<br/>towards the interior of the house and found not a man of us at his<br/>post but Gray. It was the first time we had ever seen him<br/>angry.<br/><br/>"Quarters!" he roared. And then, as we all slunk back to our<br/>places, "Gray," he said, "I'll put your name in the log; you've<br/>stood by your duty like a seaman. Mr. Trelawney, I'm surprised at<br/>you, sir. Doctor, I thought you had worn the king's coat! If that<br/>was how you served at Fontenoy, sir, you'd have been better in your<br/>berth."<br/><br/>The doctor's watch were all back at their loopholes, the rest<br/>were busy loading the spare muskets, and everyone with a red face,<br/>you may be certain, and a flea in his ear, as the saying is.<br/><br/>The captain looked on for a while in silence. Then he spoke.<br/><br/>"My lads," said he, "I've given Silver a broadside. I pitched it<br/>in red-hot on purpose; and before the hour's out, as he said, we<br/>shall be boarded. We're outnumbered, I needn't tell you that, but<br/>we fight in shelter; and a minute ago I should have said we fought<br/>with discipline. I've no manner of doubt that we can drub them, if<br/>you choose."<br/><br/>Then he went the rounds and saw, as he said, that all was<br/>clear.<br/><br/>
