<br/>"Don't he?" replied the doctor. "Well, step up here, Dick, and<br/>let me see your tongue. No, I should be surprised if he did! The<br/>man's tongue is fit to frighten the French. Another fever."<br/><br/>"Ah, there," said Morgan, "that comed of sp'iling Bibles."<br/><br/>"That comes—as you call it—of being arrant asses," retorted the<br/>doctor, "and not having sense enough to know honest air from<br/>poison, and the dry land from a vile, pestiferous slough. I think<br/>it most probable—though of course it's only an opinion—that you'll<br/>all have the deuce to pay before you get that malaria out of your<br/>systems. Camp in a bog, would you? Silver, I'm surprised at you.<br/>You're less of a fool than many, take you all round; but you don't<br/>appear to me to have the rudiments of a notion of the rules of<br/>health.<br/><br/>"Well," he added after he had dosed them round and they had<br/>taken his prescriptions, with really laughable humility, more like<br/>charity schoolchildren than blood-guilty mutineers and<br/>pirates—"well, that's done for today. And now I should wish to have<br/>a talk with that boy, please."<br/><br/>And he nodded his head in my direction carelessly.<br/><br/>George Merry was at the door, spitting and spluttering over some<br/>bad-tasted medicine; but at the first word of the doctor's proposal<br/>he swung round with a deep flush and cried "No!" and swore.<br/><br/>Silver struck the barrel with his open hand.<br/><br/>"Si-lence!" he roared and looked about him positively like a<br/>lion. "Doctor," he went on in his usual tones, "I was a-thinking of<br/>that, knowing as how you had a fancy for the boy. We're all humbly<br/>grateful for your kindness, and as you see, puts faith in you and<br/>takes the drugs down like that much grog. And I take it I've found<br/>a way as'll suit all. Hawkins, will you give me your word of honour<br/>as a young gentleman—for a young gentleman you are, although poor<br/>born—your word of honour not to slip your cable?"<br/><br/>I readily gave the pledge required.<br/><br/>"Then, doctor," said Silver, "you just step outside o' that<br/>stockade, and once you're there I'll bring the boy down on the<br/>inside, and I reckon you can yarn through the spars. Good day to<br/>you, sir, and all our dooties to the squire and Cap'n<br/>Smollett."<br/><br/>
