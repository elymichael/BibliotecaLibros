<br/>After that, we kept under cover of the bulwarks, and when next I<br/>looked out they had disappeared from the spit, and the spit itself<br/>had almost melted out of sight in the growing distance. That was,<br/>at least, the end of that; and before noon, to my inexpressible<br/>joy, the highest rock of Treasure Island had sunk into the blue<br/>round of sea.<br/><br/>We were so short of men that everyone on board had to bear a<br/>handâ€”only the captain lying on a mattress in the stern and giving<br/>his orders, for though greatly recovered he was still in want of<br/>quiet. We laid her head for the nearest port in Spanish America,<br/>for we could not risk the voyage home without fresh hands; and as<br/>it was, what with baffling winds and a couple of fresh gales, we<br/>were all worn out before we reached it.<br/><br/>It was just at sundown when we cast anchor in a most beautiful<br/>land-locked gulf, and were immediately surrounded by shore boats<br/>full of Negroes and Mexican Indians and half-bloods selling fruits<br/>and vegetables and offering to dive for bits of money. The sight of<br/>so many good-humoured faces (especially the blacks), the taste of<br/>the tropical fruits, and above all the lights that began to shine<br/>in the town made a most charming contrast to our dark and bloody<br/>sojourn on the island; and the doctor and the squire, taking me<br/>along with them, went ashore to pass the early part of the night.<br/>Here they met the captain of an English man-of-war, fell in talk<br/>with him, went on board his ship, and, in short, had so agreeable a<br/>time that day was breaking when we came alongside the<br/>Hispaniola.<br/><br/>Ben Gunn was on deck alone, and as soon as we came on board he<br/>began, with wonderful contortions, to make us a confession. Silver<br/>was gone. The maroon had connived at his escape in a shore boat<br/>some hours ago, and he now assured us he had only done so to<br/>preserve our lives, which would certainly have been forfeit if<br/>"that man with the one leg had stayed aboard." But this was not<br/>all. The sea-cook had not gone empty-handed. He had cut through a<br/>bulkhead unobserved and had removed one of the sacks of coin, worth<br/>perhaps three or four hundred guineas, to help him on his further<br/>wanderings.<br/><br/>I think we were all pleased to be so cheaply quit of him.<br/><br/>Well, to make a long story short, we got a few hands on board,<br/>made a good cruise home, and the Hispaniola reached Bristol just as<br/>Mr. Blandly was beginning to think of fitting out her consort. Five<br/>men only of those who had sailed returned with her. "Drink and the<br/>devil had done for the rest," with a vengeance, although, to be<br/>sure, we were not quite in so bad a case as that other ship they<br/>sang about:<br/><br/>With one man of her crew alive,<br/><br/>What put to sea with seventy-five.<br/><br/>All of us had an ample share of the treasure and used it wisely<br/>or foolishly, according to our natures. Captain Smollett is now<br/>retired from the sea. Gray not only saved his money, but being<br/>suddenly smit with the desire to rise, also studied his profession,<br/>and he is now mate and part owner of a fine full-rigged ship,<br/>married besides, and the father of a family. As for Ben Gunn, he<br/>got a thousand pounds, which he spent or lost in three weeks, or to<br/>be more exact, in nineteen days, for he was back begging on the<br/>twentieth. Then he was given a lodge to keep, exactly as he had<br/>feared upon the island; and he still lives, a great favourite,<br/>though something of a butt, with the country boys, and a notable<br/>singer in church on Sundays and saints' days.<br/><br/>Of Silver we have heard no more. That formidable seafaring man<br/>with one leg has at last gone clean out of my life; but I dare say<br/>he met his old Negress, and perhaps still lives in comfort with her<br/>and Captain Flint. It is to be hoped so, I suppose, for his chances<br/>of comfort in another world are very small.<br/><br/>
