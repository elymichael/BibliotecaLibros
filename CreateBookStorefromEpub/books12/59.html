<br/>"Oh, I know'd Dick was square," returned the voice of the<br/>coxswain, Israel Hands. "He's no fool, is Dick." And he turned his<br/>quid and spat. "But look here," he went on, "here's what I want to<br/>know, Barbecue: how long are we a-going to stand off and on like a<br/>blessed bumboat? I've had a'most enough o' Cap'n Smollett; he's<br/>hazed me long enough, by thunder! I want to go into that cabin, I<br/>do. I want their pickles and wines, and that."<br/><br/>"Israel," said Silver, "your head ain't much account, nor ever<br/>was. But you're able to hear, I reckon; leastways, your ears is big<br/>enough. Now, here's what I say: you'll berth forward, and you'll<br/>live hard, and you'll speak soft, and you'll keep sober till I give<br/>the word; and you may lay to that, my son."<br/><br/>"Well, I don't say no, do I?" growled the coxswain. "What I say<br/>is, when? That's what I say."<br/><br/>"When! By the powers!" cried Silver. "Well now, if you want to<br/>know, I'll tell you when. The last moment I can manage, and that's<br/>when. Here's a first-rate seaman, Cap'n Smollett, sails the blessed<br/>ship for us. Here's this squire and doctor with a map and suchâ€”I<br/>don't know where it is, do I? No more do you, says you. Well then,<br/>I mean this squire and doctor shall find the stuff, and help us to<br/>get it aboard, by the powers. Then we'll see. If I was sure of you<br/>all, sons of double Dutchmen, I'd have Cap'n Smollett navigate us<br/>half-way back again before I struck."<br/><br/>"Why, we're all seamen aboard here, I should think," said the<br/>lad Dick.<br/><br/>"We're all forecastle hands, you mean," snapped Silver. "We can<br/>steer a course, but who's to set one? That's what all you gentlemen<br/>split on, first and last. If I had my way, I'd have Cap'n Smollett<br/>work us back into the trades at least; then we'd have no blessed<br/>miscalculations and a spoonful of water a day. But I know the sort<br/>you are. I'll finish with 'em at the island, as soon's the blunt's<br/>on board, and a pity it is. But you're never happy till you're<br/>drunk. Split my sides, I've a sick heart to sail with the likes of<br/>you!"<br/><br/>"Easy all, Long John," cried Israel. "Who's a-crossin' of<br/>you?"<br/><br/>"Why, how many tall ships, think ye, now, have I seen laid<br/>aboard? And how many brisk lads drying in the sun at Execution<br/>Dock?" cried Silver. "And all for this same hurry and hurry and<br/>hurry. You hear me? I seen a thing or two at sea, I have. If you<br/>would on'y lay your course, and a p'int to windward, you would ride<br/>in carriages, you would. But not you! I know you. You'll have your<br/>mouthful of rum tomorrow, and go hang."<br/><br/>"Everybody knowed you was a kind of a chapling, John; but<br/>there's others as could hand and steer as well as you," said<br/>Israel. "They liked a bit o' fun, they did. They wasn't so high and<br/>dry, nohow, but took their fling, like jolly companions every<br/>one."<br/><br/>"So?" says Silver. "Well, and where are they now? Pew was that<br/>sort, and he died a beggar-man. Flint was, and he died of rum at<br/>Savannah. Ah, they was a sweet crew, they was! On'y, where are<br/>they?"<br/><br/>
