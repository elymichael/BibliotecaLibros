We had some heavy weather, which only proved the qualities of
the Hispaniola. Every man on board seemed well content, and they
must have been hard to please if they had been otherwise, for it is
my belief there was never a ship's company so spoiled since Noah
put to sea. Double grog was going on the least excuse; there was
duff on odd days, as, for instance, if the squire heard it was any
man's birthday, and always a barrel of apples standing broached in
the waist for anyone to help himself that had a fancy.

"Never knew good come of it yet," the captain said to Dr.
Livesey. "Spoil forecastle hands, make devils. That's my belief."
But good did come of the apple barrel, as you shall hear, for if it
had not been for that, we should have had no note of warning and
might all have perished by the hand of treachery.

This was how it came about.

We had run up the trades to get the wind of the island we were
after—I am not allowed to be more plain—and now we were running
down for it with a bright lookout day and night. It was about the
last day of our outward voyage by the largest computation; some
time that night, or at latest before noon of the morrow, we should
sight the Treasure Island. We were heading S.S.W. and had a steady
breeze abeam and a quiet sea. The Hispaniola rolled steadily,
dipping her bowsprit now and then with a whiff of spray. All was
drawing alow and aloft; everyone was in the bravest spirits because
we were now so near an end of the first part of our adventure.

Now, just after sundown, when all my work was over and I was on
my way to my berth, it occurred to me that I should like an apple.
I ran on deck. The watch was all forward looking out for the
island. The man at the helm was watching the luff of the sail and
whistling away gently to himself, and that was the only sound
excepting the swish of the sea against the bows and around the
sides of the ship.

In I got bodily into the apple barrel, and found there was
scarce an apple left; but sitting down there in the dark, what with
the sound of the waters and the rocking movement of the ship, I had
either fallen asleep or was on the point of doing so when a heavy
man sat down with rather a clash close by. The barrel shook as he
leaned his shoulders against it, and I was just about to jump up
when the man began to speak. It was Silver's voice, and before I
had heard a dozen words, I would not have shown myself for all the
world, but lay there, trembling and listening, in the extreme of
fear and curiosity, for from these dozen words I understood that
the lives of all the honest men aboard depended upon me alone.
