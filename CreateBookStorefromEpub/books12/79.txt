"Silver?" I asked.

"Ah, Silver!" says he. "That were his name."

"He's the cook, and the ringleader too."

He was still holding me by the wrist, and at that he give it
quite a wring.

"If you was sent by Long John," he said, "I'm as good as pork,
and I know it. But where was you, do you suppose?"

I had made my mind up in a moment, and by way of answer told him
the whole story of our voyage and the predicament in which we found
ourselves. He heard me with the keenest interest, and when I had
done he patted me on the head.

"You're a good lad, Jim," he said; "and you're all in a clove
hitch, ain't you? Well, you just put your trust in Ben Gunn—Ben
Gunn's the man to do it. Would you think it likely, now, that your
squire would prove a liberal-minded one in case of help—him being
in a clove hitch, as you remark?"

I told him the squire was the most liberal of men.

"Aye, but you see," returned Ben Gunn, "I didn't mean giving me
a gate to keep, and a suit of livery clothes, and such; that's not
my mark, Jim. What I mean is, would he be likely to come down to
the toon of, say one thousand pounds out of money that's as good as
a man's own already?"

"I am sure he would," said I. "As it was, all hands were to
share."

"And a passage home?" he added with a look of great
shrewdness.
