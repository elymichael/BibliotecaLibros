About Stevenson:

Robert Louis (Balfour) Stevenson (November 13, 1850â€“December 3,
1894), was a Scottish novelist, poet, and travel writer, and a
leading representative of Neo-romanticism in English literature. He
was the man who "seemed to pick the right word up on the point of
his pen, like a man playing spillikins", as G. K. Chesterton put
it. He was also greatly admired by many authors, including Jorge
Luis Borges, Ernest Hemingway, Rudyard Kipling and Vladimir
Nabokov. Most modernist writers dismissed him, however, because he
was popular and did not write within their narrow definition of
literature. It is only recently that critics have begun to look
beyond Stevenson's popularity and allow him a place in the canon.
