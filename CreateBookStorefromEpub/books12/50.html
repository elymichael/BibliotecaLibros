"One more," said the captain. "There's been too much blabbing<br/>already."<br/><br/>"Far too much," agreed the doctor.<br/><br/>"I'll tell you what I've heard myself," continued Captain<br/>Smollett: "that you have a map of an island, that there's crosses<br/>on the map to show where treasure is, and that the island liesâ€”"<br/>And then he named the latitude and longitude exactly.<br/><br/>"I never told that," cried the squire, "to a soul!"<br/><br/>"The hands know it, sir," returned the captain.<br/><br/>"Livesey, that must have been you or Hawkins," cried the<br/>squire.<br/><br/>"It doesn't much matter who it was," replied the doctor. And I<br/>could see that neither he nor the captain paid much regard to Mr.<br/>Trelawney's protestations. Neither did I, to be sure, he was so<br/>loose a talker; yet in this case I believe he was really right and<br/>that nobody had told the situation of the island.<br/><br/>"Well, gentlemen," continued the captain, "I don't know who has<br/>this map; but I make it a point, it shall be kept secret even from<br/>me and Mr. Arrow. Otherwise I would ask you to let me resign."<br/><br/>"I see," said the doctor. "You wish us to keep this matter dark<br/>and to make a garrison of the stern part of the ship, manned with<br/>my friend's own people, and provided with all the arms and powder<br/>on board. In other words, you fear a mutiny."<br/><br/>"Sir," said Captain Smollett, "with no intention to take<br/>offence, I deny your right to put words into my mouth. No captain,<br/>sir, would be justified in going to sea at all if he had ground<br/>enough to say that. As for Mr. Arrow, I believe him thoroughly<br/>honest; some of the men are the same; all may be for what I know.<br/>But I am responsible for the ship's safety and the life of every<br/>man Jack aboard of her. I see things going, as I think, not quite<br/>right. And I ask you to take certain precautions or let me resign<br/>my berth. And that's all."<br/><br/>"Captain Smollett," began the doctor with a smile, "did ever you<br/>hear the fable of the mountain and the mouse? You'll excuse me, I<br/>dare say, but you remind me of that fable. When you came in here,<br/>I'll stake my wig, you meant more than this."<br/>
