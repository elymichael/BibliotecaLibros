Indeed, on a second glance, it seemed impossible to fancy that
the body was in a natural position. But for some disarray (the
work, perhaps, of the birds that had fed upon him or of the
slow-growing creeper that had gradually enveloped his remains) the
man lay perfectly straight—his feet pointing in one direction, his
hands, raised above his head like a diver's, pointing directly in
the opposite.

"I've taken a notion into my old numbskull," observed Silver.
"Here's the compass; there's the tip-top p'int o' Skeleton Island,
stickin' out like a tooth. Just take a bearing, will you, along the
line of them bones."

It was done. The body pointed straight in the direction of the
island, and the compass read duly E.S.E. and by E.

"I thought so," cried the cook; "this here is a p'inter. Right
up there is our line for the Pole Star and the jolly dollars. But,
by thunder! If it don't make me cold inside to think of Flint. This
is one of his jokes, and no mistake. Him and these six was alone
here; he killed 'em, every man; and this one he hauled here and
laid down by compass, shiver my timbers! They're long bones, and
the hair's been yellow. Aye, that would be Allardyce. You mind
Allardyce, Tom Morgan?"

"Aye, aye," returned Morgan; "I mind him; he owed me money, he
did, and took my knife ashore with him."

"Speaking of knives," said another, "why don't we find his'n
lying round? Flint warn't the man to pick a seaman's pocket; and
the birds, I guess, would leave it be."

"By the powers, and that's true!" cried Silver.

"There ain't a thing left here," said Merry, still feeling round
among the bones; "not a copper doit nor a baccy box. It don't look
nat'ral to me."

"No, by gum, it don't," agreed Silver; "not nat'ral, nor not
nice, says you. Great guns! Messmates, but if Flint was living,
this would be a hot spot for you and me. Six they were, and six are
we; and bones is what they are now."

"I saw him dead with these here deadlights," said Morgan. "Billy
took me in. There he laid, with penny-pieces on his eyes."

"Dead—aye, sure enough he's dead and gone below," said the
fellow with the bandage; "but if ever sperrit walked, it would be
Flint's. Dear heart, but he died bad, did Flint!"
