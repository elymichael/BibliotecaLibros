"All drunk, sir," struck in the voice of Silver from behind<br/>us.<br/><br/>Silver, I should say, was allowed his entire liberty, and in<br/>spite of daily rebuffs, seemed to regard himself once more as quite<br/>a privileged and friendly dependent. Indeed, it was remarkable how<br/>well he bore these slights and with what unwearying politeness he<br/>kept on trying to ingratiate himself with all. Yet, I think, none<br/>treated him better than a dog, unless it was Ben Gunn, who was<br/>still terribly afraid of his old quartermaster, or myself, who had<br/>really something to thank him for; although for that matter, I<br/>suppose, I had reason to think even worse of him than anybody else,<br/>for I had seen him meditating a fresh treachery upon the plateau.<br/>Accordingly, it was pretty gruffly that the doctor answered<br/>him.<br/><br/>"Drunk or raving," said he.<br/><br/>"Right you were, sir," replied Silver; "and precious little odds<br/>which, to you and me."<br/><br/>"I suppose you would hardly ask me to call you a humane man,"<br/>returned the doctor with a sneer, "and so my feelings may surprise<br/>you, Master Silver. But if I were sure they were raving—as I am<br/>morally certain one, at least, of them is down with fever—I should<br/>leave this camp, and at whatever risk to my own carcass, take them<br/>the assistance of my skill."<br/><br/>"Ask your pardon, sir, you would be very wrong," quoth Silver.<br/>"You would lose your precious life, and you may lay to that. I'm on<br/>your side now, hand and glove; and I shouldn't wish for to see the<br/>party weakened, let alone yourself, seeing as I know what I owes<br/>you. But these men down there, they couldn't keep their word—no,<br/>not supposing they wished to; and what's more, they couldn't<br/>believe as you could."<br/><br/>"No," said the doctor. "You're the man to keep your word, we<br/>know that."<br/><br/>Well, that was about the last news we had of the three pirates.<br/>Only once we heard a gunshot a great way off and supposed them to<br/>be hunting. A council was held, and it was decided that we must<br/>desert them on the island—to the huge glee, I must say, of Ben<br/>Gunn, and with the strong approval of Gray. We left a good stock of<br/>powder and shot, the bulk of the salt goat, a few medicines, and<br/>some other necessaries, tools, clothing, a spare sail, a fathom or<br/>two of rope, and by the particular desire of the doctor, a handsome<br/>present of tobacco.<br/><br/>That was about our last doing on the island. Before that, we had<br/>got the treasure stowed and had shipped enough water and the<br/>remainder of the goat meat in case of any distress; and at last,<br/>one fine morning, we weighed anchor, which was about all that we<br/>could manage, and stood out of North Inlet, the same colours flying<br/>that the captain had flown and fought under at the palisade.<br/><br/>The three fellows must have been watching us closer than we<br/>thought for, as we soon had proved. For coming through the narrows,<br/>we had to lie very near the southern point, and there we saw all<br/>three of them kneeling together on a spit of sand, with their arms<br/>raised in supplication. It went to all our hearts, I think, to<br/>leave them in that wretched state; but we could not risk another<br/>mutiny; and to take them home for the gibbet would have been a<br/>cruel sort of kindness. The doctor hailed them and told them of the<br/>stores we had left, and where they were to find them. But they<br/>continued to call us by name and appeal to us, for God's sake, to<br/>be merciful and not leave them to die in such a place.<br/><br/>At last, seeing the ship still bore on her course and was now<br/>swiftly drawing out of earshot, one of them—I know not which it<br/>was—leapt to his feet with a hoarse cry, whipped his musket to his<br/>shoulder, and sent a shot whistling over Silver's head and through<br/>the main-sail.<br/>
