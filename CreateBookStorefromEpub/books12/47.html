<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>3<br/>Powder and Arms<br/><br/><br/>T<br/>he Hispaniola lay<br/>some way out, and we went under the figureheads and round the<br/>sterns of many other ships, and their cables sometimes grated<br/>underneath our keel, and sometimes swung above us. At last,<br/>however, we got alongside, and were met and saluted as we stepped<br/>aboard by the mate, Mr. Arrow, a brown old sailor with earrings in<br/>his ears and a squint. He and the squire were very thick and<br/>friendly, but I soon observed that things were not the same between<br/>Mr. Trelawney and the captain.<br/><br/>This last was a sharp-looking man who seemed angry with<br/>everything on board and was soon to tell us why, for we had hardly<br/>got down into the cabin when a sailor followed us.<br/><br/>"Captain Smollett, sir, axing to speak with you," said he.<br/><br/>"I am always at the captain's orders. Show him in," said the<br/>squire.<br/><br/>The captain, who was close behind his messenger, entered at once<br/>and shut the door behind him.<br/><br/>"Well, Captain Smollett, what have you to say? All well, I hope;<br/>all shipshape and seaworthy?"<br/><br/>
