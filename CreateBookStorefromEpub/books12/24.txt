The Last of the Blind Man


M
y curiosity, in a
sense, was stronger than my fear, for I could not remain where I
was, but crept back to the bank again, whence, sheltering my head
behind a bush of broom, I might command the road before our door. I
was scarcely in position ere my enemies began to arrive, seven or
eight of them, running hard, their feet beating out of time along
the road and the man with the lantern some paces in front. Three
men ran together, hand in hand; and I made out, even through the
mist, that the middle man of this trio was the blind beggar. The
next moment his voice showed me that I was right.

"Down with the door!" he cried.

"Aye, aye, sir!" answered two or three; and a rush was made upon
the Admiral Benbow, the lantern-bearer following; and then I could
see them pause, and hear speeches passed in a lower key, as if they
were surprised to find the door open. But the pause was brief, for
the blind man again issued his commands. His voice sounded louder
and higher, as if he were afire with eagerness and rage.

"In, in, in!" he shouted, and cursed them for their delay.

Four or five of them obeyed at once, two remaining on the road
with the formidable beggar. There was a pause, then a cry of
surprise, and then a voice shouting from the house, "Bill's
dead."

But the blind man swore at them again for their delay.
