The Captain's Papers


W
e rode hard all
the way till we drew up before Dr. Livesey's door. The house was
all dark to the front.

Mr. Dance told me to jump down and knock, and Dogger gave me a
stirrup to descend by. The door was opened almost at once by the
maid.

"Is Dr. Livesey in?" I asked.

No, she said, he had come home in the afternoon but had gone up
to the hall to dine and pass the evening with the squire. "So there
we go, boys," said Mr. Dance.

This time, as the distance was short, I did not mount, but ran
with Dogger's stirrup-leather to the lodge gates and up the long,
leafless, moonlit avenue to where the white line of the hall
buildings looked on either hand on great old gardens. Here Mr.
Dance dismounted, and taking me along with him, was admitted at a
word into the house.

The servant led us down a matted passage and showed us at the
end into a great library, all lined with bookcases and busts upon
the top of them, where the squire and Dr. Livesey sat, pipe in
hand, on either side of a bright fire.
