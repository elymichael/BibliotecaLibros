<br/>It was around about the size of a crown piece. One side was<br/>blank, for it had been the last leaf; the other contained a verse<br/>or two of Revelation—these words among the rest, which struck<br/>sharply home upon my mind: "Without are dogs and murderers." The<br/>printed side had been blackened with wood ash, which already began<br/>to come off and soil my fingers; on the blank side had been written<br/>with the same material the one word "Depposed." I have that<br/>curiosity beside me at this moment, but not a trace of writing now<br/>remains beyond a single scratch, such as a man might make with his<br/>thumb-nail.<br/><br/>That was the end of the night's business. Soon after, with a<br/>drink all round, we lay down to sleep, and the outside of Silver's<br/>vengeance was to put George Merry up for sentinel and threaten him<br/>with death if he should prove unfaithful.<br/><br/>It was long ere I could close an eye, and heaven knows I had<br/>matter enough for thought in the man whom I had slain that<br/>afternoon, in my own most perilous position, and above all, in the<br/>remarkable game that I saw Silver now engaged upon—keeping the<br/>mutineers together with one hand and grasping with the other after<br/>every means, possible and impossible, to make his peace and save<br/>his miserable life. He himself slept peacefully and snored aloud,<br/>yet my heart was sore for him, wicked as he was, to think on the<br/>dark perils that environed and the shameful gibbet that awaited<br/>him.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
