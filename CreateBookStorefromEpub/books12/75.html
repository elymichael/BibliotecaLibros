Instantly I began to extricate myself and crawl back again, with<br/>what speed and silence I could manage, to the more open portion of<br/>the wood. As I did so, I could hear hails coming and going between<br/>the old buccaneer and his comrades, and this sound of danger lent<br/>me wings. As soon as I was clear of the thicket, I ran as I never<br/>ran before, scarce minding the direction of my flight, so long as<br/>it led me from the murderers; and as I ran, fear grew and grew upon<br/>me until it turned into a kind of frenzy.<br/><br/>Indeed, could anyone be more entirely lost than I? When the gun<br/>fired, how should I dare to go down to the boats among those<br/>fiends, still smoking from their crime? Would not the first of them<br/>who saw me wring my neck like a snipe's? Would not my absence<br/>itself be an evidence to them of my alarm, and therefore of my<br/>fatal knowledge? It was all over, I thought. Good-bye to the<br/>Hispaniola; good-bye to the squire, the doctor, and the captain!<br/>There was nothing left for me but death by starvation or death by<br/>the hands of the mutineers.<br/><br/>All this while, as I say, I was still running, and without<br/>taking any notice, I had drawn near to the foot of the little hill<br/>with the two peaks and had got into a part of the island where the<br/>live-oaks grew more widely apart and seemed more like forest trees<br/>in their bearing and dimensions. Mingled with these were a few<br/>scattered pines, some fifty, some nearer seventy, feet high. The<br/>air too smelt more freshly than down beside the marsh. And here a<br/>fresh alarm brought me to a standstill with a thumping heart.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
