<br/>"Ax your pardon, sir," returned one of the men; "you're pretty<br/>free with some of the rules; maybe you'll kindly keep an eye upon<br/>the rest. This crew's dissatisfied; this crew don't vally bullying<br/>a marlin-spike; this crew has its rights like other crews, I'll<br/>make so free as that; and by your own rules, I take it we can talk<br/>together. I ax your pardon, sir, acknowledging you for to be<br/>captaing at this present; but I claim my right, and steps outside<br/>for a council."<br/><br/>And with an elaborate sea-salute, this fellow, a long,<br/>ill-looking, yellow-eyed man of five and thirty, stepped coolly<br/>towards the door and disappeared out of the house. One after<br/>another the rest followed his example, each making a salute as he<br/>passed, each adding some apology. "According to rules," said one.<br/>"Forecastle council," said Morgan. And so with one remark or<br/>another all marched out and left Silver and me alone with the<br/>torch.<br/><br/>The sea-cook instantly removed his pipe.<br/><br/>"Now, look you here, Jim Hawkins," he said in a steady whisper<br/>that was no more than audible, "you're within half a plank of<br/>death, and what's a long sight worse, of torture. They're going to<br/>throw me off. But, you mark, I stand by you through thick and thin.<br/>I didn't mean to; no, not till you spoke up. I was about desperate<br/>to lose that much blunt, and be hanged into the bargain. But I see<br/>you was the right sort. I says to myself, you stand by Hawkins,<br/>John, and Hawkins'll stand by you. You're his last card, and by the<br/>living thunder, John, he's yours! Back to back, says I. You save<br/>your witness, and he'll save your neck!"<br/><br/>I began dimly to understand.<br/><br/>"You mean all's lost?" I asked.<br/><br/>"Aye, by gum, I do!" he answered. "Ship gone, neck gone—that's<br/>the size of it. Once I looked into that bay, Jim Hawkins, and seen<br/>no schooner—well, I'm tough, but I gave out. As for that lot and<br/>their council, mark me, they're outright fools and cowards. I'll<br/>save your life—if so be as I can—from them. But, see here, Jim—tit<br/>for tat—you save Long John from swinging."<br/><br/>I was bewildered; it seemed a thing so hopeless he was<br/>asking—he, the old buccaneer, the ringleader throughout.<br/><br/>"What I can do, that I'll do," I said.<br/><br/>"It's a bargain!" cried Long John. "You speak up plucky, and by<br/>thunder, I've a chance!"<br/><br/>
