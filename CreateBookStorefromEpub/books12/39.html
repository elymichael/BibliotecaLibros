You can fancy the excitement into which that letter put me. I<br/>was half beside myself with glee; and if ever I despised a man, it<br/>was old Tom Redruth, who could do nothing but grumble and lament.<br/>Any of the under-gamekeepers would gladly have changed places with<br/>him; but such was not the squire's pleasure, and the squire's<br/>pleasure was like law among them all. Nobody but old Redruth would<br/>have dared so much as even to grumble.<br/><br/>The next morning he and I set out on foot for the Admiral<br/>Benbow, and there I found my mother in good health and spirits. The<br/>captain, who had so long been a cause of so much discomfort, was<br/>gone where the wicked cease from troubling. The squire had had<br/>everything repaired, and the public rooms and the sign repainted,<br/>and had added some furniture—above all a beautiful armchair for<br/>mother in the bar. He had found her a boy as an apprentice also so<br/>that she should not want help while I was gone.<br/><br/>It was on seeing that boy that I understood, for the first time,<br/>my situation. I had thought up to that moment of the adventures<br/>before me, not at all of the home that I was leaving; and now, at<br/>sight of this clumsy stranger, who was to stay here in my place<br/>beside my mother, I had my first attack of tears. I am afraid I led<br/>that boy a dog's life, for as he was new to the work, I had a<br/>hundred opportunities of setting him right and putting him down,<br/>and I was not slow to profit by them. The night passed, and the<br/>next day, after dinner, Redruth and I were afoot again and on the<br/>road. I said good-bye to Mother and the cove where I had lived<br/>since I was born, and the dear old Admiral Benbow—since he was<br/>repainted, no longer quite so dear. One of my last thoughts was of<br/>the captain, who had so often strode along the beach with his<br/>cocked hat, his sabre-cut cheek, and his old brass telescope. Next<br/>moment we had turned the corner and my home was out of sight.<br/><br/>The mail picked us up about dusk at the Royal George on the<br/>heath. I was wedged in between Redruth and a stout old gentleman,<br/>and in spite of the swift motion and the cold night air, I must<br/>have dozed a great deal from the very first, and then slept like a<br/>log up hill and down dale through stage after stage, for when I was<br/>awakened at last it was by a punch in the ribs, and I opened my<br/>eyes to find that we were standing still before a large building in<br/>a city street and that the day had already broken a long time.<br/><br/>"Where are we?" I asked.<br/><br/>"Bristol," said Tom. "Get down."<br/><br/>Mr. Trelawney had taken up his residence at an inn far down the<br/>docks to superintend the work upon the schooner. Thither we had now<br/>to walk, and our way, to my great delight, lay along the quays and<br/>beside the great multitude of ships of all sizes and rigs and<br/>nations. In one, sailors were singing at their work, in another<br/>there were men aloft, high over my head, hanging to threads that<br/>seemed no thicker than a spider's. Though I had lived by the shore<br/>all my life, I seemed never to have been near the sea till then.<br/>The smell of tar and salt was something new. I saw the most<br/>wonderful figureheads, that had all been far over the ocean. I saw,<br/>besides, many old sailors, with rings in their ears, and whiskers<br/>curled in ringlets, and tarry pigtails, and their swaggering,<br/>clumsy sea-walk; and if I had seen as many kings or archbishops I<br/>could not have been more delighted.<br/><br/>And I was going to sea myself, to sea in a schooner, with a<br/>piping boatswain and pig-tailed singing seamen, to sea, bound for<br/>an unknown island, and to seek for buried treasure!<br/><br/>While I was still in this delightful dream, we came suddenly in<br/>front of a large inn and met Squire Trelawney, all dressed out like<br/>a sea-officer, in stout blue cloth, coming out of the door with a<br/>smile on his face and a capital imitation of a sailor's walk.<br/><br/>"Here you are," he cried, "and the doctor came last night from<br/>London. Bravo! The ship's company complete!"<br/><br/>"Oh, sir," cried I, "when do we sail?"<br/>
