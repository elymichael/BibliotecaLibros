Another time he came and was silent for a while. Then he put his<br/>head on one side, and looked at me.<br/><br/>"Is this Ben Gunn a man?" he asked.<br/><br/>"I do not know, sir," said I. "I am not very sure whether he's<br/>sane."<br/><br/>"If there's any doubt about the matter, he is," returned the<br/>doctor. "A man who has been three years biting his nails on a<br/>desert island, Jim, can't expect to appear as sane as you or me. It<br/>doesn't lie in human nature. Was it cheese you said he had a fancy<br/>for?"<br/><br/>"Yes, sir, cheese," I answered.<br/><br/>"Well, Jim," says he, "just see the good that comes of being<br/>dainty in your food. You've seen my snuff-box, haven't you? And you<br/>never saw me take snuff, the reason being that in my snuff-box I<br/>carry a piece of Parmesan cheese—a cheese made in Italy, very<br/>nutritious. Well, that's for Ben Gunn!"<br/><br/>Before supper was eaten we buried old Tom in the sand and stood<br/>round him for a while bare-headed in the breeze. A good deal of<br/>firewood had been got in, but not enough for the captain's fancy,<br/>and he shook his head over it and told us we "must get back to this<br/>tomorrow rather livelier." Then, when we had eaten our pork and<br/>each had a good stiff glass of brandy grog, the three chiefs got<br/>together in a corner to discuss our prospects.<br/><br/>It appears they were at their wits' end what to do, the stores<br/>being so low that we must have been starved into surrender long<br/>before help came. But our best hope, it was decided, was to kill<br/>off the buccaneers until they either hauled down their flag or ran<br/>away with the Hispaniola. From nineteen they were already reduced<br/>to fifteen, two others were wounded, and one at least—the man shot<br/>beside the gun—severely wounded, if he were not dead. Every time we<br/>had a crack at them, we were to take it, saving our own lives, with<br/>the extremest care. And besides that, we had two able allies—rum<br/>and the climate.<br/><br/>As for the first, though we were about half a mile away, we<br/>could hear them roaring and singing late into the night; and as for<br/>the second, the doctor staked his wig that, camped where they were<br/>in the marsh and unprovided with remedies, the half of them would<br/>be on their backs before a week.<br/><br/>"So," he added, "if we are not all shot down first they'll be<br/>glad to be packing in the schooner. It's always a ship, and they<br/>can get to buccaneering again, I suppose."<br/><br/>"First ship that ever I lost," said Captain Smollett.<br/>
