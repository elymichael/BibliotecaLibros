<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>3<br/>The Cruise of the Coracle<br/><br/><br/>I<br/>t was broad day<br/>when I awoke and found myself tossing at the south-west end of<br/>Treasure Island. The sun was up but was still hid from me behind<br/>the great bulk of the Spy-glass, which on this side descended<br/>almost to the sea in formidable cliffs.<br/><br/>Haulbowline Head and Mizzen-mast Hill were at my elbow, the hill<br/>bare and dark, the head bound with cliffs forty or fifty feet high<br/>and fringed with great masses of fallen rock. I was scarce a<br/>quarter of a mile to seaward, and it was my first thought to paddle<br/>in and land.<br/><br/>That notion was soon given over. Among the fallen rocks the<br/>breakers spouted and bellowed; loud reverberations, heavy sprays<br/>flying and falling, succeeded one another from second to second;<br/>and I saw myself, if I ventured nearer, dashed to death upon the<br/>rough shore or spending my strength in vain to scale the beetling<br/>crags.<br/><br/>Nor was that all, for crawling together on flat tables of rock<br/>or letting themselves drop into the sea with loud reports I beheld<br/>huge slimy monsters—soft snails, as it were, of incredible<br/>bigness—two or three score of them together, making the rocks to<br/>echo with their barkings.<br/><br/>I have understood since that they were sea lions, and entirely<br/>harmless. But the look of them, added to the difficulty of the<br/>shore and the high running of the surf, was more than enough to<br/>disgust me of that landing-place. I felt willing rather to starve<br/>at sea than to confront such perils.<br/><br/>In the meantime I had a better chance, as I supposed, before me.<br/>North of Haulbowline Head, the land runs in a long way, leaving at<br/>low tide a long stretch of yellow sand. To the north of that,<br/>again, there comes another cape—Cape of the Woods, as it was marked<br/>upon the chart—buried in tall green pines, which descended to the<br/>margin of the sea.<br/><br/>
