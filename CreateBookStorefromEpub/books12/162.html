<br/>A tall tree was thus the principal mark. Now, right before us<br/>the anchorage was bounded by a plateau from two to three hundred<br/>feet high, adjoining on the north the sloping southern shoulder of<br/>the Spy-glass and rising again towards the south into the rough,<br/>cliffy eminence called the Mizzen-mast Hill. The top of the plateau<br/>was dotted thickly with pine-trees of varying height. Every here<br/>and there, one of a different species rose forty or fifty feet<br/>clear above its neighbours, and which of these was the particular<br/>"tall tree" of Captain Flint could only be decided on the spot, and<br/>by the readings of the compass.<br/><br/>Yet, although that was the case, every man on board the boats<br/>had picked a favourite of his own ere we were half-way over, Long<br/>John alone shrugging his shoulders and bidding them wait till they<br/>were there.<br/><br/>We pulled easily, by Silver's directions, not to weary the hands<br/>prematurely, and after quite a long passage, landed at the mouth of<br/>the second river—that which runs down a woody cleft of the<br/>Spy-glass. Thence, bending to our left, we began to ascend the<br/>slope towards the plateau.<br/><br/>At the first outset, heavy, miry ground and a matted, marish<br/>vegetation greatly delayed our progress; but by little and little<br/>the hill began to steepen and become stony under foot, and the wood<br/>to change its character and to grow in a more open order. It was,<br/>indeed, a most pleasant portion of the island that we were now<br/>approaching. A heavy-scented broom and many flowering shrubs had<br/>almost taken the place of grass. Thickets of green nutmeg-trees<br/>were dotted here and there with the red columns and the broad<br/>shadow of the pines; and the first mingled their spice with the<br/>aroma of the others. The air, besides, was fresh and stirring, and<br/>this, under the sheer sunbeams, was a wonderful refreshment to our<br/>senses.<br/><br/>The party spread itself abroad, in a fan shape, shouting and<br/>leaping to and fro. About the centre, and a good way behind the<br/>rest, Silver and I followed—I tethered by my rope, he ploughing,<br/>with deep pants, among the sliding gravel. From time to time,<br/>indeed, I had to lend him a hand, or he must have missed his<br/>footing and fallen backward down the hill.<br/><br/>We had thus proceeded for about half a mile and were approaching<br/>the brow of the plateau when the man upon the farthest left began<br/>to cry aloud, as if in terror. Shout after shout came from him, and<br/>the others began to run in his direction.<br/><br/>"He can't 'a found the treasure," said old Morgan, hurrying past<br/>us from the right, "for that's clean a-top."<br/><br/>Indeed, as we found when we also reached the spot, it was<br/>something very different. At the foot of a pretty big pine and<br/>involved in a green creeper, which had even partly lifted some of<br/>the smaller bones, a human skeleton lay, with a few shreds of<br/>clothing, on the ground. I believe a chill struck for a moment to<br/>every heart.<br/><br/>"He was a seaman," said George Merry, who, bolder than the rest,<br/>had gone up close and was examining the rags of clothing.<br/>"Leastways, this is good sea-cloth."<br/><br/>"Aye, aye," said Silver; "like enough; you wouldn't look to find<br/>a bishop here, I reckon. But what sort of a way is that for bones<br/>to lie? 'Tain't in natur'."<br/><br/>
