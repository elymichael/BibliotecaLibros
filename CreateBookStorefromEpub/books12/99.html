And he pinched me the third time with the same air of<br/>cleverness.<br/><br/>"And when Ben Gunn is wanted, you know where to find him, Jim.<br/>Just wheer you found him today. And him that comes is to have a<br/>white thing in his hand, and he's to come alone. Oh! And you'll say<br/>this: 'Ben Gunn,' says you, 'has reasons of his own.'"<br/><br/>"Well," said I, "I believe I understand. You have something to<br/>propose, and you wish to see the squire or the doctor, and you're<br/>to be found where I found you. Is that all?"<br/><br/>"And when? says you," he added. "Why, from about noon<br/>observation to about six bells."<br/><br/>"Good," said I, "and now may I go?"<br/><br/>"You won't forget?" he inquired anxiously. "Precious sight, and<br/>reasons of his own, says you. Reasons of his own; that's the<br/>mainstay; as between man and man. Well, then"—still holding me—"I<br/>reckon you can go, Jim. And, Jim, if you was to see Silver, you<br/>wouldn't go for to sell Ben Gunn? Wild horses wouldn't draw it from<br/>you? No, says you. And if them pirates camp ashore, Jim, what would<br/>you say but there'd be widders in the morning?"<br/><br/>Here he was interrupted by a loud report, and a cannonball came<br/>tearing through the trees and pitched in the sand not a hundred<br/>yards from where we two were talking. The next moment each of us<br/>had taken to his heels in a different direction.<br/><br/>For a good hour to come frequent reports shook the island, and<br/>balls kept crashing through the woods. I moved from hiding-place to<br/>hiding-place, always pursued, or so it seemed to me, by these<br/>terrifying missiles. But towards the end of the bombardment, though<br/>still I durst not venture in the direction of the stockade, where<br/>the balls fell oftenest, I had begun, in a manner, to pluck up my<br/>heart again, and after a long detour to the east, crept down among<br/>the shore-side trees.<br/><br/>The sun had just set, the sea breeze was rustling and tumbling<br/>in the woods and ruffling the grey surface of the anchorage; the<br/>tide, too, was far out, and great tracts of sand lay uncovered; the<br/>air, after the heat of the day, chilled me through my jacket.<br/><br/>The Hispaniola still lay where she had anchored; but, sure<br/>enough, there was the Jolly Roger—the black flag of piracy—flying<br/>from her peak. Even as I looked, there came another red flash and<br/>another report that sent the echoes clattering, and one more<br/>round-shot whistled through the air. It was the last of the<br/>cannonade.<br/><br/>I lay for some time watching the bustle which succeeded the<br/>attack. Men were demolishing something with axes on the beach near<br/>the stockade—the poor jolly-boat, I afterwards discovered. Away,<br/>near the mouth of the river, a great fire was glowing among the<br/>trees, and between that point and the ship one of the gigs kept<br/>coming and going, the men, whom I had seen so gloomy, shouting at<br/>the oars like children. But there was a sound in their voices which<br/>suggested rum.<br/>
