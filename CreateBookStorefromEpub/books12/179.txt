The bar silver and the arms still lie, for all that I know,
where Flint buried them; and certainly they shall lie there for me.
Oxen and wain-ropes would not bring me back again to that accursed
island; and the worst dreams that ever I have are when I hear the
surf booming about its coasts or start upright in bed with the
sharp voice of Captain Flint still ringing in my ears: "Pieces of
eight! Pieces of eight!"
