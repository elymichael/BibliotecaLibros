<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>5<br/>The Treasure Hunt--The Voice Among the Trees<br/><br/><br/>P<br/>artly from the<br/>damping influence of this alarm, partly to rest Silver and the sick<br/>folk, the whole party sat down as soon as they had gained the brow<br/>of the ascent.<br/><br/>The plateau being somewhat tilted towards the west, this spot on<br/>which we had paused commanded a wide prospect on either hand.<br/>Before us, over the tree-tops, we beheld the Cape of the Woods<br/>fringed with surf; behind, we not only looked down upon the<br/>anchorage and Skeleton Island, but saw—clear across the spit and<br/>the eastern lowlands—a great field of open sea upon the east. Sheer<br/>above us rose the Spy-glass, here dotted with single pines, there<br/>black with precipices. There was no sound but that of the distant<br/>breakers, mounting from all round, and the chirp of countless<br/>insects in the brush. Not a man, not a sail, upon the sea; the very<br/>largeness of the view increased the sense of solitude.<br/><br/>Silver, as he sat, took certain bearings with his compass.<br/><br/>"There are three 'tall trees'" said he, "about in the right line<br/>from Skeleton Island. 'Spy-glass shoulder,' I take it, means that<br/>lower p'int there. It's child's play to find the stuff now. I've<br/>half a mind to dine first."<br/><br/>"I don't feel sharp," growled Morgan. "Thinkin' o' Flint—I think<br/>it were—as done me."<br/><br/>"Ah, well, my son, you praise your stars he's dead," said<br/>Silver.<br/><br/>
