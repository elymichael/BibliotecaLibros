<br/>"Round the house, lads! Round the house!" cried the captain; and<br/>even in the hurly-burly, I perceived a change in his voice.<br/><br/>Mechanically, I obeyed, turned eastwards, and with my cutlass<br/>raised, ran round the corner of the house. Next moment I was face<br/>to face with Anderson. He roared aloud, and his hanger went up<br/>above his head, flashing in the sunlight. I had not time to be<br/>afraid, but as the blow still hung impending, leaped in a trice<br/>upon one side, and missing my foot in the soft sand, rolled<br/>headlong down the slope.<br/><br/>When I had first sallied from the door, the other mutineers had<br/>been already swarming up the palisade to make an end of us. One<br/>man, in a red night-cap, with his cutlass in his mouth, had even<br/>got upon the top and thrown a leg across. Well, so short had been<br/>the interval that when I found my feet again all was in the same<br/>posture, the fellow with the red night-cap still half-way over,<br/>another still just showing his head above the top of the stockade.<br/>And yet, in this breath of time, the fight was over and the victory<br/>was ours.<br/><br/>Gray, following close behind me, had cut down the big boatswain<br/>ere he had time to recover from his last blow. Another had been<br/>shot at a loophole in the very act of firing into the house and now<br/>lay in agony, the pistol still smoking in his hand. A third, as I<br/>had seen, the doctor had disposed of at a blow. Of the four who had<br/>scaled the palisade, one only remained unaccounted for, and he,<br/>having left his cutlass on the field, was now clambering out again<br/>with the fear of death upon him.<br/><br/>"Fireâ€”fire from the house!" cried the doctor. "And you, lads,<br/>back into cover."<br/><br/>But his words were unheeded, no shot was fired, and the last<br/>boarder made good his escape and disappeared with the rest into the<br/>wood. In three seconds nothing remained of the attacking party but<br/>the five who had fallen, four on the inside and one on the outside<br/>of the palisade.<br/><br/>The doctor and Gray and I ran full speed for shelter. The<br/>survivors would soon be back where they had left their muskets, and<br/>at any moment the fire might recommence.<br/><br/>The house was by this time somewhat cleared of smoke, and we saw<br/>at a glance the price we had paid for victory. Hunter lay beside<br/>his loophole, stunned; Joyce by his, shot through the head, never<br/>to move again; while right in the centre, the squire was supporting<br/>the captain, one as pale as the other.<br/><br/>"The captain's wounded," said Mr. Trelawney.<br/><br/>"Have they run?" asked Mr. Smollett.<br/><br/>
