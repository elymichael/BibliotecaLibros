<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>7<br/>And Last<br/><br/><br/>T<br/>he next morning we<br/>fell early to work, for the transportation of this great mass of<br/>gold near a mile by land to the beach, and thence three miles by<br/>boat to the Hispaniola, was a considerable task for so small a<br/>number of workmen. The three fellows still abroad upon the island<br/>did not greatly trouble us; a single sentry on the shoulder of the<br/>hill was sufficient to ensure us against any sudden onslaught, and<br/>we thought, besides, they had had more than enough of fighting.<br/><br/>Therefore the work was pushed on briskly. Gray and Ben Gunn came<br/>and went with the boat, while the rest during their absences piled<br/>treasure on the beach. Two of the bars, slung in a rope's end, made<br/>a good load for a grown man—one that he was glad to walk slowly<br/>with. For my part, as I was not much use at carrying, I was kept<br/>busy all day in the cave packing the minted money into<br/>bread-bags.<br/><br/>It was a strange collection, like Billy Bones's hoard for the<br/>diversity of coinage, but so much larger and so much more varied<br/>that I think I never had more pleasure than in sorting them.<br/>English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Georges, and Louises,<br/>doubloons and double guineas and moidores and sequins, the pictures<br/>of all the kings of Europe for the last hundred years, strange<br/>Oriental pieces stamped with what looked like wisps of string or<br/>bits of spider's web, round pieces and square pieces, and pieces<br/>bored through the middle, as if to wear them round your neck—nearly<br/>every variety of money in the world must, I think, have found a<br/>place in that collection; and for number, I am sure they were like<br/>autumn leaves, so that my back ached with stooping and my fingers<br/>with sorting them out.<br/><br/>Day after day this work went on; by every evening a fortune had<br/>been stowed aboard, but there was another fortune waiting for the<br/>morrow; and all this time we heard nothing of the three surviving<br/>mutineers.<br/><br/>At last—I think it was on the third night—the doctor and I were<br/>strolling on the shoulder of the hill where it overlooks the<br/>lowlands of the isle, when, from out the thick darkness below, the<br/>wind brought us a noise between shrieking and singing. It was only<br/>a snatch that reached our ears, followed by the former silence.<br/><br/>"Heaven forgive them," said the doctor; "'tis the<br/>mutineers!"<br/><br/>
