"Ax your pardon, sir," returned one of the men; "you're pretty
free with some of the rules; maybe you'll kindly keep an eye upon
the rest. This crew's dissatisfied; this crew don't vally bullying
a marlin-spike; this crew has its rights like other crews, I'll
make so free as that; and by your own rules, I take it we can talk
together. I ax your pardon, sir, acknowledging you for to be
captaing at this present; but I claim my right, and steps outside
for a council."

And with an elaborate sea-salute, this fellow, a long,
ill-looking, yellow-eyed man of five and thirty, stepped coolly
towards the door and disappeared out of the house. One after
another the rest followed his example, each making a salute as he
passed, each adding some apology. "According to rules," said one.
"Forecastle council," said Morgan. And so with one remark or
another all marched out and left Silver and me alone with the
torch.

The sea-cook instantly removed his pipe.

"Now, look you here, Jim Hawkins," he said in a steady whisper
that was no more than audible, "you're within half a plank of
death, and what's a long sight worse, of torture. They're going to
throw me off. But, you mark, I stand by you through thick and thin.
I didn't mean to; no, not till you spoke up. I was about desperate
to lose that much blunt, and be hanged into the bargain. But I see
you was the right sort. I says to myself, you stand by Hawkins,
John, and Hawkins'll stand by you. You're his last card, and by the
living thunder, John, he's yours! Back to back, says I. You save
your witness, and he'll save your neck!"

I began dimly to understand.

"You mean all's lost?" I asked.

"Aye, by gum, I do!" he answered. "Ship gone, neck gone—that's
the size of it. Once I looked into that bay, Jim Hawkins, and seen
no schooner—well, I'm tough, but I gave out. As for that lot and
their council, mark me, they're outright fools and cowards. I'll
save your life—if so be as I can—from them. But, see here, Jim—tit
for tat—you save Long John from swinging."

I was bewildered; it seemed a thing so hopeless he was
asking—he, the old buccaneer, the ringleader throughout.

"What I can do, that I'll do," I said.

"It's a bargain!" cried Long John. "You speak up plucky, and by
thunder, I've a chance!"
