<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>5<br/>What I Heard in the Apple Barrel<br/><br/><br/>"N<br/>o, not I," said<br/>Silver. "Flint was cap'n; I was quartermaster, along of my timber<br/>leg. The same broadside I lost my leg, old Pew lost his deadlights.<br/>It was a master surgeon, him that ampytated me—out of college and<br/>all—Latin by the bucket, and what not; but he was hanged like a<br/>dog, and sun-dried like the rest, at Corso Castle. That was<br/>Roberts' men, that was, and comed of changing names to their<br/>ships—Royal Fortune and so on. Now, what a ship was christened, so<br/>let her stay, I says. So it was with the Cassandra, as brought us<br/>all safe home from Malabar, after England took the viceroy of the<br/>Indies; so it was with the old Walrus, Flint's old ship, as I've<br/>seen amuck with the red blood and fit to sink with gold."<br/><br/>"Ah!" cried another voice, that of the youngest hand on board,<br/>and evidently full of admiration. "He was the flower of the flock,<br/>was Flint!"<br/><br/>"Davis was a man too, by all accounts," said Silver. "I never<br/>sailed along of him; first with England, then with Flint, that's my<br/>story; and now here on my own account, in a manner of speaking. I<br/>laid by nine hundred safe, from England, and two thousand after<br/>Flint. That ain't bad for a man before the mast—all safe in bank.<br/>'Tain't earning now, it's saving does it, you may lay to that.<br/>Where's all England's men now? I dunno. Where's Flint's? Why, most<br/>on 'em aboard here, and glad to get the duff—been begging before<br/>that, some on 'em. Old Pew, as had lost his sight, and might have<br/>thought shame, spends twelve hundred pound in a year, like a lord<br/>in Parliament. Where is he now? Well, he's dead now and under<br/>hatches; but for two year before that, shiver my timbers, the man<br/>was starving! He begged, and he stole, and he cut throats, and<br/>starved at that, by the powers!"<br/><br/>"Well, it ain't much use, after all," said the young seaman.<br/><br/>"'Tain't much use for fools, you may lay to it—that, nor<br/>nothing," cried Silver. "But now, you look here: you're young, you<br/>are, but you're as smart as paint. I see that when I set my eyes on<br/>you, and I'll talk to you like a man."<br/><br/>You may imagine how I felt when I heard this abominable old<br/>rogue addressing another in the very same words of flattery as he<br/>had used to myself. I think, if I had been able, that I would have<br/>killed him through the barrel. Meantime, he ran on, little<br/>supposing he was overheard.<br/><br/>
