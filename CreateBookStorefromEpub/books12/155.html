"We've quite a surprise for you too, sir," he continued. "We've<br/>a little stranger here—he! he! A noo boarder and lodger, sir, and<br/>looking fit and taut as a fiddle; slep' like a supercargo, he did,<br/>right alongside of John—stem to stem we was, all night."<br/><br/>Dr. Livesey was by this time across the stockade and pretty near<br/>the cook, and I could hear the alteration in his voice as he said,<br/>"Not Jim?"<br/><br/>"The very same Jim as ever was," says Silver.<br/><br/>The doctor stopped outright, although he did not speak, and it<br/>was some seconds before he seemed able to move on.<br/><br/>"Well, well," he said at last, "duty first and pleasure<br/>afterwards, as you might have said yourself, Silver. Let us<br/>overhaul these patients of yours."<br/><br/>A moment afterwards he had entered the block house and with one<br/>grim nod to me proceeded with his work among the sick. He seemed<br/>under no apprehension, though he must have known that his life,<br/>among these treacherous demons, depended on a hair; and he rattled<br/>on to his patients as if he were paying an ordinary professional<br/>visit in a quiet English family. His manner, I suppose, reacted on<br/>the men, for they behaved to him as if nothing had occurred, as if<br/>he were still ship's doctor and they still faithful hands before<br/>the mast.<br/><br/>"You're doing well, my friend," he said to the fellow with the<br/>bandaged head, "and if ever any person had a close shave, it was<br/>you; your head must be as hard as iron. Well, George, how goes it?<br/>You're a pretty colour, certainly; why, your liver, man, is upside<br/>down. Did you take that medicine? Did he take that medicine,<br/>men?"<br/><br/>"Aye, aye, sir, he took it, sure enough," returned Morgan.<br/><br/>"Because, you see, since I am mutineers' doctor, or prison<br/>doctor as I prefer to call it," says Doctor Livesey in his<br/>pleasantest way, "I make it a point of honour not to lose a man for<br/>King George (God bless him!) and the gallows."<br/><br/>The rogues looked at each other but swallowed the home-thrust in<br/>silence.<br/><br/>"Dick don't feel well, sir," said one.<br/>
