<br/>I pulled in hand over hand on the cord, and when I judged myself<br/>near enough, rose at infinite risk to about half my height and thus<br/>commanded the roof and a slice of the interior of the cabin.<br/><br/>By this time the schooner and her little consort were gliding<br/>pretty swiftly through the water; indeed, we had already fetched up<br/>level with the camp-fire. The ship was talking, as sailors say,<br/>loudly, treading the innumerable ripples with an incessant<br/>weltering splash; and until I got my eye above the window-sill I<br/>could not comprehend why the watchmen had taken no alarm. One<br/>glance, however, was sufficient; and it was only one glance that I<br/>durst take from that unsteady skiff. It showed me Hands and his<br/>companion locked together in deadly wrestle, each with a hand upon<br/>the other's throat.<br/><br/>I dropped upon the thwart again, none too soon, for I was near<br/>overboard. I could see nothing for the moment but these two<br/>furious, encrimsoned faces swaying together under the smoky lamp,<br/>and I shut my eyes to let them grow once more familiar with the<br/>darkness.<br/><br/>The endless ballad had come to an end at last, and the whole<br/>diminished company about the camp-fire had broken into the chorus I<br/>had heard so often:<br/><br/>"Fifteen men on the dead man's chest—<br/><br/>Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!<br/><br/>Drink and the devil had done for the rest—<br/><br/>Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!"<br/><br/>I was just thinking how busy drink and the devil were at that<br/>very moment in the cabin of the Hispaniola, when I was surprised by<br/>a sudden lurch of the coracle. At the same moment, she yawed<br/>sharply and seemed to change her course. The speed in the meantime<br/>had strangely increased.<br/><br/>I opened my eyes at once. All round me were little ripples,<br/>combing over with a sharp, bristling sound and slightly<br/>phosphorescent. The Hispaniola herself, a few yards in whose wake I<br/>was still being whirled along, seemed to stagger in her course, and<br/>I saw her spars toss a little against the blackness of the night;<br/>nay, as I looked longer, I made sure she also was wheeling to the<br/>southward.<br/><br/>
