I
Strike the Jolly Roger


I
had scarce gained
a position on the bowsprit when the flying jib flapped and filled
upon the other tack, with a report like a gun. The schooner
trembled to her keel under the reverse, but next moment, the other
sails still drawing, the jib flapped back again and hung idle.

This had nearly tossed me off into the sea; and now I lost no
time, crawled back along the bowsprit, and tumbled head foremost on
the deck.

I was on the lee side of the forecastle, and the main-sail,
which was still drawing, concealed from me a certain portion of the
after-deck. Not a soul was to be seen. The planks, which had not
been swabbed since the mutiny, bore the print of many feet, and an
empty bottle, broken by the neck, tumbled to and fro like a live
thing in the scuppers.

Suddenly the Hispaniola came right into the wind. The jibs
behind me cracked aloud, the rudder slammed to, the whole ship gave
a sickening heave and shudder, and at the same moment the main-boom
swung inboard, the sheet groaning in the blocks, and showed me the
lee after-deck.

There were the two watchmen, sure enough: red-cap on his back,
as stiff as a handspike, with his arms stretched out like those of
a crucifix and his teeth showing through his open lips; Israel
Hands propped against the bulwarks, his chin on his chest, his
hands lying open before him on the deck, his face as white, under
its tan, as a tallow candle.

For a while the ship kept bucking and sidling like a vicious
horse, the sails filling, now on one tack, now on another, and the
boom swinging to and fro till the mast groaned aloud under the
strain. Now and again too there would come a cloud of light sprays
over the bulwark and a heavy blow of the ship's bows against the
swell; so much heavier weather was made of it by this great rigged
ship than by my home-made, lop-sided coracle, now gone to the
bottom of the sea.
