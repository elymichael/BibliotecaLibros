"Who's the best shot?" asked the captain.

"Mr. Trelawney, out and away," said I.

"Mr. Trelawney, will you please pick me off one of these men,
sir? Hands, if possible," said the captain.

Trelawney was as cool as steel. He looked to the priming of his
gun.

"Now," cried the captain, "easy with that gun, sir, or you'll
swamp the boat. All hands stand by to trim her when he aims."

The squire raised his gun, the rowing ceased, and we leaned over
to the other side to keep the balance, and all was so nicely
contrived that we did not ship a drop.

They had the gun, by this time, slewed round upon the swivel,
and Hands, who was at the muzzle with the rammer, was in
consequence the most exposed. However, we had no luck, for just as
Trelawney fired, down he stooped, the ball whistled over him, and
it was one of the other four who fell.

The cry he gave was echoed not only by his companions on board
but by a great number of voices from the shore, and looking in that
direction I saw the other pirates trooping out from among the trees
and tumbling into their places in the boats.

"Here come the gigs, sir," said I.

"Give way, then," cried the captain. "We mustn't mind if we
swamp her now. If we can't get ashore, all's up."
