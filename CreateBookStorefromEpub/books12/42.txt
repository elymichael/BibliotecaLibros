"Mr. Silver, sir?" I asked, holding out the note.

"Yes, my lad," said he; "such is my name, to be sure. And who
may you be?" And then as he saw the squire's letter, he seemed to
me to give something almost like a start.

"Oh!" said he, quite loud, and offering his hand. "I see. You
are our new cabin-boy; pleased I am to see you."

And he took my hand in his large firm grasp.

Just then one of the customers at the far side rose suddenly and
made for the door. It was close by him, and he was out in the
street in a moment. But his hurry had attracted my notice, and I
recognized him at glance. It was the tallow-faced man, wanting two
fingers, who had come first to the Admiral Benbow.

"Oh," I cried, "stop him! It's Black Dog!"

"I don't care two coppers who he is," cried Silver. "But he
hasn't paid his score. Harry, run and catch him."

One of the others who was nearest the door leaped up and started
in pursuit.

"If he were Admiral Hawke he shall pay his score," cried Silver;
and then, relinquishing my hand, "Who did you say he was?" he
asked. "Black what?"

"Dog, sir," said I. Has Mr. Trelawney not told you of the
buccaneers? He was one of them."

"So?" cried Silver. "In my house! Ben, run and help Harry. One
of those swabs, was he? Was that you drinking with him, Morgan?
Step up here."
