Nor had we much time left to us for thought. Suddenly, with a
loud huzza, a little cloud of pirates leaped from the woods on the
north side and ran straight on the stockade. At the same moment,
the fire was once more opened from the woods, and a rifle ball sang
through the doorway and knocked the doctor's musket into bits.

The boarders swarmed over the fence like monkeys. Squire and
Gray fired again and yet again; three men fell, one forwards into
the enclosure, two back on the outside. But of these, one was
evidently more frightened than hurt, for he was on his feet again
in a crack and instantly disappeared among the trees.

Two had bit the dust, one had fled, four had made good their
footing inside our defences, while from the shelter of the woods
seven or eight men, each evidently supplied with several muskets,
kept up a hot though useless fire on the log-house.

The four who had boarded made straight before them for the
building, shouting as they ran, and the men among the trees shouted
back to encourage them. Several shots were fired, but such was the
hurry of the marksmen that not one appears to have taken effect. In
a moment, the four pirates had swarmed up the mound and were upon
us.

The head of Job Anderson, the boatswain, appeared at the middle
loophole.

"At 'em, all handsâ€”all hands!" he roared in a voice of
thunder.

At the same moment, another pirate grasped Hunter's musket by
the muzzle, wrenched it from his hands, plucked it through the
loophole, and with one stunning blow, laid the poor fellow
senseless on the floor. Meanwhile a third, running unharmed all
around the house, appeared suddenly in the doorway and fell with
his cutlass on the doctor.

Our position was utterly reversed. A moment since we were
firing, under cover, at an exposed enemy; now it was we who lay
uncovered and could not return a blow.

The log-house was full of smoke, to which we owed our
comparative safety. Cries and confusion, the flashes and reports of
pistol-shots, and one loud groan rang in my ears.

"Out, lads, out, and fight 'em in the open! Cutlasses!" cried
the captain.

I snatched a cutlass from the pile, and someone, at the same
time snatching another, gave me a cut across the knuckles which I
hardly felt. I dashed out of the door into the clear sunlight.
Someone was close behind, I knew not whom. Right in front, the
doctor was pursuing his assailant down the hill, and just as my
eyes fell upon him, beat down his guard and sent him sprawling on
his back with a great slash across the face.
