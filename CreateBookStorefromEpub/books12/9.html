<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>2<br/>Black Dog Appears and Disappears<br/><br/><br/>I<br/>t was not very<br/>long after this that there occurred the first of the mysterious<br/>events that rid us at last of the captain, though not, as you will<br/>see, of his affairs. It was a bitter cold winter, with long, hard<br/>frosts and heavy gales; and it was plain from the first that my<br/>poor father was little likely to see the spring. He sank daily, and<br/>my mother and I had all the inn upon our hands, and were kept busy<br/>enough without paying much regard to our unpleasant guest.<br/><br/>It was one January morning, very early—a pinching, frosty<br/>morning—the cove all grey with hoar-frost, the ripple lapping<br/>softly on the stones, the sun still low and only touching the<br/>hilltops and shining far to seaward. The captain had risen earlier<br/>than usual and set out down the beach, his cutlass swinging under<br/>the broad skirts of the old blue coat, his brass telescope under<br/>his arm, his hat tilted back upon his head. I remember his breath<br/>hanging like smoke in his wake as he strode off, and the last sound<br/>I heard of him as he turned the big rock was a loud snort of<br/>indignation, as though his mind was still running upon Dr.<br/>Livesey.<br/><br/>Well, mother was upstairs with father and I was laying the<br/>breakfast-table against the captain's return when the parlour door<br/>opened and a man stepped in on whom I had never set my eyes before.<br/>He was a pale, tallowy creature, wanting two fingers of the left<br/>hand, and though he wore a cutlass, he did not look much like a<br/>fighter. I had always my eye open for seafaring men, with one leg<br/>or two, and I remember this one puzzled me. He was not sailorly,<br/>and yet he had a smack of the sea about him too. I asked him what<br/>was for his service, and he said he would take rum; but as I was<br/>going out of the room to fetch it, he sat down upon a table and<br/>motioned me to draw near. I paused where I was, with my napkin in<br/>my hand.<br/><br/>"Come here, sonny," says he. "Come nearer here."<br/><br/>I took a step nearer.<br/><br/>"Is this here table for my mate Bill?" he asked with a kind of<br/>leer.<br/><br/>
