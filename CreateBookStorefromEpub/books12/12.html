"Jim," says he, "rum"; and as he spoke, he reeled a little, and<br/>caught himself with one hand against the wall.<br/><br/>"Are you hurt?" cried I.<br/><br/>"Rum," he repeated. "I must get away from here. Rum! Rum!"<br/><br/>I ran to fetch it, but I was quite unsteadied by all that had<br/>fallen out, and I broke one glass and fouled the tap, and while I<br/>was still getting in my own way, I heard a loud fall in the<br/>parlour, and running in, beheld the captain lying full length upon<br/>the floor. At the same instant my mother, alarmed by the cries and<br/>fighting, came running downstairs to help me. Between us we raised<br/>his head. He was breathing very loud and hard, but his eyes were<br/>closed and his face a horrible colour.<br/><br/>"Dear, deary me," cried my mother, "what a disgrace upon the<br/>house! And your poor father sick!"<br/><br/>In the meantime, we had no idea what to do to help the captain,<br/>nor any other thought but that he had got his death-hurt in the<br/>scuffle with the stranger. I got the rum, to be sure, and tried to<br/>put it down his throat, but his teeth were tightly shut and his<br/>jaws as strong as iron. It was a happy relief for us when the door<br/>opened and Doctor Livesey came in, on his visit to my father.<br/><br/>"Oh, doctor," we cried, "what shall we do? Where is he<br/>wounded?"<br/><br/>"Wounded? A fiddle-stick's end!" said the doctor. "No more<br/>wounded than you or I. The man has had a stroke, as I warned him.<br/>Now, Mrs. Hawkins, just you run upstairs to your husband and tell<br/>him, if possible, nothing about it. For my part, I must do my best<br/>to save this fellow's trebly worthless life; Jim, you get me a<br/>basin."<br/><br/>When I got back with the basin, the doctor had already ripped up<br/>the captain's sleeve and exposed his great sinewy arm. It was<br/>tattooed in several places. "Here's luck," "A fair wind," and<br/>"Billy Bones his fancy," were very neatly and clearly executed on<br/>the forearm; and up near the shoulder there was a sketch of a<br/>gallows and a man hanging from itâ€”done, as I thought, with great<br/>spirit.<br/><br/>"Prophetic," said the doctor, touching this picture with his<br/>finger. "And now, Master Billy Bones, if that be your name, we'll<br/>have a look at the colour of your blood. Jim," he said, "are you<br/>afraid of blood?"<br/><br/>"No, sir," said I.<br/>
