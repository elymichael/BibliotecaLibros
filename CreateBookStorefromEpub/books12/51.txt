"Doctor," said the captain, "you are smart. When I came in here
I meant to get discharged. I had no thought that Mr. Trelawney
would hear a word."

"No more I would," cried the squire. "Had Livesey not been here
I should have seen you to the deuce. As it is, I have heard you. I
will do as you desire, but I think the worse of you."

"That's as you please, sir," said the captain. "You'll find I do
my duty."

And with that he took his leave.

"Trelawney," said the doctor, "contrary to all my notions, I
believed you have managed to get two honest men on board with
youâ€”that man and John Silver."

"Silver, if you like," cried the squire; "but as for that
intolerable humbug, I declare I think his conduct unmanly,
unsailorly, and downright un-English."

"Well," says the doctor, "we shall see."

When we came on deck, the men had begun already to take out the
arms and powder, yo-ho-ing at their work, while the captain and Mr.
Arrow stood by superintending.

The new arrangement was quite to my liking. The whole schooner
had been overhauled; six berths had been made astern out of what
had been the after-part of the main hold; and this set of cabins
was only joined to the galley and forecastle by a sparred passage
on the port side. It had been originally meant that the captain,
Mr. Arrow, Hunter, Joyce, the doctor, and the squire were to occupy
these six berths. Now Redruth and I were to get two of them and Mr.
Arrow and the captain were to sleep on deck in the companion, which
had been enlarged on each side till you might almost have called it
a round-house. Very low it was still, of course; but there was room
to swing two hammocks, and even the mate seemed pleased with the
arrangement. Even he, perhaps, had been doubtful as to the crew,
but that is only guess, for as you shall hear, we had not long the
benefit of his opinion.

We were all hard at work, changing the powder and the berths,
when the last man or two, and Long John along with them, came off
in a shore-boat.
