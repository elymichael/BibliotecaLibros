<br/>And the head popped back again; and we heard no more, for the<br/>time, of these six very faint-hearted seamen.<br/><br/>By this time, tumbling things in as they came, we had the<br/>jolly-boat loaded as much as we dared. Joyce and I got out through<br/>the stern-port, and we made for shore again as fast as oars could<br/>take us.<br/><br/>This second trip fairly aroused the watchers along shore.<br/>"Lillibullero" was dropped again; and just before we lost sight of<br/>them behind the little point, one of them whipped ashore and<br/>disappeared. I had half a mind to change my plan and destroy their<br/>boats, but I feared that Silver and the others might be close at<br/>hand, and all might very well be lost by trying for too much.<br/><br/>We had soon touched land in the same place as before and set to<br/>provision the block house. All three made the first journey,<br/>heavily laden, and tossed our stores over the palisade. Then,<br/>leaving Joyce to guard them—one man, to be sure, but with half a<br/>dozen muskets—Hunter and I returned to the jolly-boat and loaded<br/>ourselves once more. So we proceeded without pausing to take<br/>breath, till the whole cargo was bestowed, when the two servants<br/>took up their position in the block house, and I, with all my<br/>power, sculled back to the Hispaniola.<br/><br/>That we should have risked a second boat load seems more daring<br/>than it really was. They had the advantage of numbers, of course,<br/>but we had the advantage of arms. Not one of the men ashore had a<br/>musket, and before they could get within range for pistol shooting,<br/>we flattered ourselves we should be able to give a good account of<br/>a half-dozen at least.<br/><br/>The squire was waiting for me at the stern window, all his<br/>faintness gone from him. He caught the painter and made it fast,<br/>and we fell to loading the boat for our very lives. Pork, powder,<br/>and biscuit was the cargo, with only a musket and a cutlass apiece<br/>for the squire and me and Redruth and the captain. The rest of the<br/>arms and powder we dropped overboard in two fathoms and a half of<br/>water, so that we could see the bright steel shining far below us<br/>in the sun, on the clean, sandy bottom.<br/><br/>By this time the tide was beginning to ebb, and the ship was<br/>swinging round to her anchor. Voices were heard faintly halloaing<br/>in the direction of the two gigs; and though this reassured us for<br/>Joyce and Hunter, who were well to the eastward, it warned our<br/>party to be off.<br/><br/>Redruth retreated from his place in the gallery and dropped into<br/>the boat, which we then brought round to the ship's counter, to be<br/>handier for Captain Smollett.<br/><br/>"Now, men," said he, "do you hear me?"<br/><br/>There was no answer from the forecastle.<br/><br/>
