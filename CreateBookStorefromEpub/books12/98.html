<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>4<br/>Narrative Resumed by Jim Hawkins: The Garrison in the Stockade<br/><br/><br/>A<br/>s soon as Ben Gunn<br/>saw the colours he came to a halt, stopped me by the arm, and sat<br/>down.<br/><br/>"Now," said he, "there's your friends, sure enough."<br/><br/>"Far more likely it's the mutineers," I answered.<br/><br/>"That!" he cried. "Why, in a place like this, where nobody puts<br/>in but gen'lemen of fortune, Silver would fly the Jolly Roger, you<br/>don't make no doubt of that. No, that's your friends. There's been<br/>blows too, and I reckon your friends has had the best of it; and<br/>here they are ashore in the old stockade, as was made years and<br/>years ago by Flint. Ah, he was the man to have a headpiece, was<br/>Flint! Barring rum, his match were never seen. He were afraid of<br/>none, not he; on'y Silver—Silver was that genteel."<br/><br/>"Well," said I, "that may be so, and so be it; all the more<br/>reason that I should hurry on and join my friends."<br/><br/>"Nay, mate," returned Ben, "not you. You're a good boy, or I'm<br/>mistook; but you're on'y a boy, all told. Now, Ben Gunn is fly. Rum<br/>wouldn't bring me there, where you're going—not rum wouldn't, till<br/>I see your born gen'leman and gets it on his word of honour. And<br/>you won't forget my words; 'A precious sight (that's what you'll<br/>say), a precious sight more confidence'—and then nips him.<br/><br/>
