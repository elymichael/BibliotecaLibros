<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>5<br/>Israel Hands<br/><br/><br/>T<br/>he wind, serving<br/>us to a desire, now hauled into the west. We could run so much the<br/>easier from the north-east corner of the island to the mouth of the<br/>North Inlet. Only, as we had no power to anchor and dared not beach<br/>her till the tide had flowed a good deal farther, time hung on our<br/>hands. The coxswain told me how to lay the ship to; after a good<br/>many trials I succeeded, and we both sat in silence over another<br/>meal.<br/><br/>"Cap'n," said he at length with that same uncomfortable smile,<br/>"here's my old shipmate, O'Brien; s'pose you was to heave him<br/>overboard. I ain't partic'lar as a rule, and I don't take no blame<br/>for settling his hash, but I don't reckon him ornamental now, do<br/>you?"<br/><br/>"I'm not strong enough, and I don't like the job; and there he<br/>lies, for me," said I.<br/><br/>"This here's an unlucky ship, this Hispaniola, Jim," he went on,<br/>blinking. "There's a power of men been killed in this Hispaniola—a<br/>sight o' poor seamen dead and gone since you and me took ship to<br/>Bristol. I never seen sich dirty luck, not I. There was this here<br/>O'Brien now—he's dead, ain't he? Well now, I'm no scholar, and<br/>you're a lad as can read and figure, and to put it straight, do you<br/>take it as a dead man is dead for good, or do he come alive<br/>again?"<br/><br/>"You can kill the body, Mr. Hands, but not the spirit; you must<br/>know that already," I replied. "O'Brien there is in another world,<br/>and may be watching us."<br/><br/>"Ah!" says he. "Well, that's unfort'nate—appears as if killing<br/>parties was a waste of time. Howsomever, sperrits don't reckon for<br/>much, by what I've seen. I'll chance it with the sperrits, Jim. And<br/>now, you've spoke up free, and I'll take it kind if you'd step down<br/>into that there cabin and get me a—well, a—shiver my timbers! I<br/>can't hit the name on 't; well, you get me a bottle of wine,<br/>Jim—this here brandy's too strong for my head."<br/><br/>
