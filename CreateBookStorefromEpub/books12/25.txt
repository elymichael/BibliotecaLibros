"Search him, some of you shirking lubbers, and the rest of you
aloft and get the chest," he cried.

I could hear their feet rattling up our old stairs, so that the
house must have shook with it. Promptly afterwards, fresh sounds of
astonishment arose; the window of the captain's room was thrown
open with a slam and a jingle of broken glass, and a man leaned out
into the moonlight, head and shoulders, and addressed the blind
beggar on the road below him.

"Pew," he cried, "they've been before us. Someone's turned the
chest out alow and aloft."

"Is it there?" roared Pew.

"The money's there."

The blind man cursed the money.

"Flint's fist, I mean," he cried.

"We don't see it here nohow," returned the man.

"Here, you below there, is it on Bill?" cried the blind man
again.

At that another fellow, probably him who had remained below to
search the captain's body, came to the door of the inn. "Bill's
been overhauled a'ready," said he; "nothin' left."

"It's these people of the inn—it's that boy. I wish I had put
his eyes out!" cried the blind man, Pew. "There were no time
ago—they had the door bolted when I tried it. Scatter, lads, and
find 'em."
