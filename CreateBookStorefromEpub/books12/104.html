The captain was in the porch, keeping himself carefully out of<br/>the way of a treacherous shot, should any be intended. He turned<br/>and spoke to us, "Doctor's watch on the lookout. Dr. Livesey take<br/>the north side, if you please; Jim, the east; Gray, west. The watch<br/>below, all hands to load muskets. Lively, men, and careful."<br/><br/>And then he turned again to the mutineers.<br/><br/>"And what do you want with your flag of truce?" he cried.<br/><br/>This time it was the other man who replied.<br/><br/>"Cap'n Silver, sir, to come on board and make terms," he<br/>shouted.<br/><br/>"Cap'n Silver! Don't know him. Who's he?" cried the captain. And<br/>we could hear him adding to himself, "Cap'n, is it? My heart, and<br/>here's promotion!"<br/><br/>Long John answered for himself. "Me, sir. These poor lads have<br/>chosen me cap'n, after your desertion, sir"â€”laying a particular<br/>emphasis upon the word "desertion." "We're willing to submit, if we<br/>can come to terms, and no bones about it. All I ask is your word,<br/>Cap'n Smollett, to let me safe and sound out of this here stockade,<br/>and one minute to get out o' shot before a gun is fired."<br/><br/>"My man," said Captain Smollett, "I have not the slightest<br/>desire to talk to you. If you wish to talk to me, you can come,<br/>that's all. If there's any treachery, it'll be on your side, and<br/>the Lord help you."<br/><br/>"That's enough, cap'n," shouted Long John cheerily. "A word from<br/>you's enough. I know a gentleman, and you may lay to that."<br/><br/>We could see the man who carried the flag of truce attempting to<br/>hold Silver back. Nor was that wonderful, seeing how cavalier had<br/>been the captain's answer. But Silver laughed at him aloud and<br/>slapped him on the back as if the idea of alarm had been absurd.<br/>Then he advanced to the stockade, threw over his crutch, got a leg<br/>up, and with great vigour and skill succeeded in surmounting the<br/>fence and dropping safely to the other side.<br/><br/>I will confess that I was far too much taken up with what was<br/>going on to be of the slightest use as sentry; indeed, I had<br/>already deserted my eastern loophole and crept up behind the<br/>captain, who had now seated himself on the threshold, with his<br/>elbows on his knees, his head in his hands, and his eyes fixed on<br/>the water as it bubbled out of the old iron kettle in the sand. He<br/>was whistling "Come, Lasses and Lads."<br/>
