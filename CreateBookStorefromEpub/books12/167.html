<br/>The buccaneers remained rooted to the ground, their eyes<br/>starting from their heads. Long after the voice had died away they<br/>still stared in silence, dreadfully, before them.<br/><br/>"That fixes it!" gasped one. "Let's go."<br/><br/>"They was his last words," moaned Morgan, "his last words above<br/>board."<br/><br/>Dick had his Bible out and was praying volubly. He had been well<br/>brought up, had Dick, before he came to sea and fell among bad<br/>companions.<br/><br/>Still Silver was unconquered. I could hear his teeth rattle in<br/>his head, but he had not yet surrendered.<br/><br/>"Nobody in this here island ever heard of Darby," he muttered;<br/>"not one but us that's here." And then, making a great effort:<br/>"Shipmates," he cried, "I'm here to get that stuff, and I'll not be<br/>beat by man or devil. I never was feared of Flint in his life, and,<br/>by the powers, I'll face him dead. There's seven hundred thousand<br/>pound not a quarter of a mile from here. When did ever a gentleman<br/>o' fortune show his stern to that much dollars for a boozy old<br/>seaman with a blue mugâ€”and him dead too?"<br/><br/>But there was no sign of reawakening courage in his followers,<br/>rather, indeed, of growing terror at the irreverence of his<br/>words.<br/><br/>"Belay there, John!" said Merry. "Don't you cross a<br/>sperrit."<br/><br/>And the rest were all too terrified to reply. They would have<br/>run away severally had they dared; but fear kept them together, and<br/>kept them close by John, as if his daring helped them. He, on his<br/>part, had pretty well fought his weakness down.<br/><br/>"Sperrit? Well, maybe," he said. "But there's one thing not<br/>clear to me. There was an echo. Now, no man ever seen a sperrit<br/>with a shadow; well then, what's he doing with an echo to him, I<br/>should like to know? That ain't in natur', surely?"<br/><br/>
