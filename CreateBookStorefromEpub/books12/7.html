Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!<br/><br/>Drink and the devil had done for the restâ€”<br/><br/>Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!"<br/><br/><br/>At first I had supposed "the dead man's chest" to be that<br/>identical big box of his upstairs in the front room, and the<br/>thought had been mingled in my nightmares with that of the<br/>one-legged seafaring man. But by this time we had all long ceased<br/>to pay any particular notice to the song; it was new, that night,<br/>to nobody but Dr. Livesey, and on him I observed it did not produce<br/>an agreeable effect, for he looked up for a moment quite angrily<br/>before he went on with his talk to old Taylor, the gardener, on a<br/>new cure for the rheumatics. In the meantime, the captain gradually<br/>brightened up at his own music, and at last flapped his hand upon<br/>the table before him in a way we all knew to mean silence. The<br/>voices stopped at once, all but Dr. Livesey's; he went on as before<br/>speaking clear and kind and drawing briskly at his pipe between<br/>every word or two. The captain glared at him for a while, flapped<br/>his hand again, glared still harder, and at last broke out with a<br/>villainous, low oath, "Silence, there, between decks!"<br/><br/>"Were you addressing me, sir?" says the doctor; and when the<br/>ruffian had told him, with another oath, that this was so, "I have<br/>only one thing to say to you, sir," replies the doctor, "that if<br/>you keep on drinking rum, the world will soon be quit of a very<br/>dirty scoundrel!"<br/><br/>The old fellow's fury was awful. He sprang to his feet, drew and<br/>opened a sailor's clasp-knife, and balancing it open on the palm of<br/>his hand, threatened to pin the doctor to the wall.<br/><br/>The doctor never so much as moved. He spoke to him as before,<br/>over his shoulder and in the same tone of voice, rather high, so<br/>that all the room might hear, but perfectly calm and steady: "If<br/>you do not put that knife this instant in your pocket, I promise,<br/>upon my honour, you shall hang at the next assizes."<br/><br/>Then followed a battle of looks between them, but the captain<br/>soon knuckled under, put up his weapon, and resumed his seat,<br/>grumbling like a beaten dog.<br/><br/>"And now, sir," continued the doctor, "since I now know there's<br/>such a fellow in my district, you may count I'll have an eye upon<br/>you day and night. I'm not a doctor only; I'm a magistrate; and if<br/>I catch a breath of complaint against you, if it's only for a piece<br/>of incivility like tonight's, I'll take effectual means to have you<br/>hunted down and routed out of this. Let that suffice."<br/><br/>Soon after, Dr. Livesey's horse came to the door and he rode<br/>away, but the captain held his peace that evening, and for many<br/>evenings to come.<br/><br/>
