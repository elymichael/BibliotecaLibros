<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>4<br/>The Treasure Hunt--Flint's Pointer<br/><br/><br/>"J<br/>im," said Silver<br/>when we were alone, "if I saved your life, you saved mine; and I'll<br/>not forget it. I seen the doctor waving you to run for itâ€”with the<br/>tail of my eye, I did; and I seen you say no, as plain as hearing.<br/>Jim, that's one to you. This is the first glint of hope I had since<br/>the attack failed, and I owe it you. And now, Jim, we're to go in<br/>for this here treasure-hunting, with sealed orders too, and I don't<br/>like it; and you and me must stick close, back to back like, and<br/>we'll save our necks in spite o' fate and fortune."<br/><br/>Just then a man hailed us from the fire that breakfast was<br/>ready, and we were soon seated here and there about the sand over<br/>biscuit and fried junk. They had lit a fire fit to roast an ox, and<br/>it was now grown so hot that they could only approach it from the<br/>windward, and even there not without precaution. In the same<br/>wasteful spirit, they had cooked, I suppose, three times more than<br/>we could eat; and one of them, with an empty laugh, threw what was<br/>left into the fire, which blazed and roared again over this unusual<br/>fuel. I never in my life saw men so careless of the morrow; hand to<br/>mouth is the only word that can describe their way of doing; and<br/>what with wasted food and sleeping sentries, though they were bold<br/>enough for a brush and be done with it, I could see their entire<br/>unfitness for anything like a prolonged campaign.<br/><br/>Even Silver, eating away, with Captain Flint upon his shoulder,<br/>had not a word of blame for their recklessness. And this the more<br/>surprised me, for I thought he had never shown himself so cunning<br/>as he did then.<br/><br/>"Aye, mates," said he, "it's lucky you have Barbecue to think<br/>for you with this here head. I got what I wanted, I did. Sure<br/>enough, they have the ship. Where they have it, I don't know yet;<br/>but once we hit the treasure, we'll have to jump about and find<br/>out. And then, mates, us that has the boats, I reckon, has the<br/>upper hand."<br/><br/>Thus he kept running on, with his mouth full of the hot bacon;<br/>thus he restored their hope and confidence, and, I more than<br/>suspect, repaired his own at the same time.<br/><br/>"As for hostage," he continued, "that's his last talk, I guess,<br/>with them he loves so dear. I've got my piece o' news, and thanky<br/>to him for that; but it's over and done. I'll take him in a line<br/>when we go treasure-hunting, for we'll keep him like so much gold,<br/>in case of accidents, you mark, and in the meantime. Once we got<br/>the ship and treasure both and off to sea like jolly companions,<br/>why then we'll talk Mr. Hawkins over, we will, and we'll give him<br/>his share, to be sure, for all his kindness."<br/><br/>
