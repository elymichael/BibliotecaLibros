And he gave it, as he spoke, a wrench that made me cry out.<br/><br/>"Sir," said I, "it is for yourself I mean. The captain is not<br/>what he used to be. He sits with a drawn cutlass. Another<br/>gentlemanâ€”"<br/><br/>"Come, now, march," interrupted he; and I never heard a voice so<br/>cruel, and cold, and ugly as that blind man's. It cowed me more<br/>than the pain, and I began to obey him at once, walking straight in<br/>at the door and towards the parlour, where our sick old buccaneer<br/>was sitting, dazed with rum. The blind man clung close to me,<br/>holding me in one iron fist and leaning almost more of his weight<br/>on me than I could carry. "Lead me straight up to him, and when I'm<br/>in view, cry out, 'Here's a friend for you, Bill.' If you don't,<br/>I'll do this," and with that he gave me a twitch that I thought<br/>would have made me faint. Between this and that, I was so utterly<br/>terrified of the blind beggar that I forgot my terror of the<br/>captain, and as I opened the parlour door, cried out the words he<br/>had ordered in a trembling voice.<br/><br/>The poor captain raised his eyes, and at one look the rum went<br/>out of him and left him staring sober. The expression of his face<br/>was not so much of terror as of mortal sickness. He made a movement<br/>to rise, but I do not believe he had enough force left in his<br/>body.<br/><br/>"Now, Bill, sit where you are," said the beggar. "If I can't<br/>see, I can hear a finger stirring. Business is business. Hold out<br/>your left hand. Boy, take his left hand by the wrist and bring it<br/>near to my right."<br/><br/>We both obeyed him to the letter, and I saw him pass something<br/>from the hollow of the hand that held his stick into the palm of<br/>the captain's, which closed upon it instantly.<br/><br/>"And now that's done," said the blind man; and at the words he<br/>suddenly left hold of me, and with incredible accuracy and<br/>nimbleness, skipped out of the parlour and into the road, where, as<br/>I still stood motionless, I could hear his stick go tap-tap-tapping<br/>into the distance.<br/><br/>It was some time before either I or the captain seemed to gather<br/>our senses, but at length, and about at the same moment, I released<br/>his wrist, which I was still holding, and he drew in his hand and<br/>looked sharply into the palm.<br/><br/>"Ten o'clock!" he cried. "Six hours. We'll do them yet," and he<br/>sprang to his feet.<br/><br/>Even as he did so, he reeled, put his hand to his throat, stood<br/>swaying for a moment, and then, with a peculiar sound, fell from<br/>his whole height face foremost to the floor.<br/><br/>I ran to him at once, calling to my mother. But haste was all in<br/>vain. The captain had been struck dead by thundering apoplexy. It<br/>is a curious thing to understand, for I had certainly never liked<br/>the man, though of late I had begun to pity him, but as soon as I<br/>saw that he was dead, I burst into a flood of tears. It was the<br/>second death I had known, and the sorrow of the first was still<br/>fresh in my heart.<br/>
