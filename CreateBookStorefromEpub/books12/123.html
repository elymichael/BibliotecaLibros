I glanced over my shoulder, and my heart jumped against my ribs.<br/>There, right behind me, was the glow of the camp-fire. The current<br/>had turned at right angles, sweeping round along with it the tall<br/>schooner and the little dancing coracle; ever quickening, ever<br/>bubbling higher, ever muttering louder, it went spinning through<br/>the narrows for the open sea.<br/><br/>Suddenly the schooner in front of me gave a violent yaw,<br/>turning, perhaps, through twenty degrees; and almost at the same<br/>moment one shout followed another from on board; I could hear feet<br/>pounding on the companion ladder and I knew that the two drunkards<br/>had at last been interrupted in their quarrel and awakened to a<br/>sense of their disaster.<br/><br/>I lay down flat in the bottom of that wretched skiff and<br/>devoutly recommended my spirit to its Maker. At the end of the<br/>straits, I made sure we must fall into some bar of raging breakers,<br/>where all my troubles would be ended speedily; and though I could,<br/>perhaps, bear to die, I could not bear to look upon my fate as it<br/>approached.<br/><br/>So I must have lain for hours, continually beaten to and fro<br/>upon the billows, now and again wetted with flying sprays, and<br/>never ceasing to expect death at the next plunge. Gradually<br/>weariness grew upon me; a numbness, an occasional stupor, fell upon<br/>my mind even in the midst of my terrors, until sleep at last<br/>supervened and in my sea-tossed coracle I lay and dreamed of home<br/>and the old Admiral Benbow.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
