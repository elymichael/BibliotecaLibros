<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>4<br/>The Sea-chest<br/><br/><br/>I<br/>lost no time, of<br/>course, in telling my mother all that I knew, and perhaps should<br/>have told her long before, and we saw ourselves at once in a<br/>difficult and dangerous position. Some of the man's money—if he had<br/>any—was certainly due to us, but it was not likely that our<br/>captain's shipmates, above all the two specimens seen by me, Black<br/>Dog and the blind beggar, would be inclined to give up their booty<br/>in payment of the dead man's debts. The captain's order to mount at<br/>once and ride for Doctor Livesey would have left my mother alone<br/>and unprotected, which was not to be thought of. Indeed, it seemed<br/>impossible for either of us to remain much longer in the house; the<br/>fall of coals in the kitchen grate, the very ticking of the clock,<br/>filled us with alarms. The neighbourhood, to our ears, seemed<br/>haunted by approaching footsteps; and what between the dead body of<br/>the captain on the parlour floor and the thought of that detestable<br/>blind beggar hovering near at hand and ready to return, there were<br/>moments when, as the saying goes, I jumped in my skin for terror.<br/>Something must speedily be resolved upon, and it occurred to us at<br/>last to go forth together and seek help in the neighbouring hamlet.<br/>No sooner said than done. Bare-headed as we were, we ran out at<br/>once in the gathering evening and the frosty fog.<br/><br/>The hamlet lay not many hundred yards away, though out of view,<br/>on the other side of the next cove; and what greatly encouraged me,<br/>it was in an opposite direction from that whence the blind man had<br/>made his appearance and whither he had presumably returned. We were<br/>not many minutes on the road, though we sometimes stopped to lay<br/>hold of each other and hearken. But there was no unusual<br/>sound—nothing but the low wash of the ripple and the croaking of<br/>the inmates of the wood.<br/><br/>It was already candle-light when we reached the hamlet, and I<br/>shall never forget how much I was cheered to see the yellow shine<br/>in doors and windows; but that, as it proved, was the best of the<br/>help we were likely to get in that quarter. For—you would have<br/>thought men would have been ashamed of themselves—no soul would<br/>consent to return with us to the Admiral Benbow. The more we told<br/>of our troubles, the more—man, woman, and child—they clung to the<br/>shelter of their houses. The name of Captain Flint, though it was<br/>strange to me, was well enough known to some there and carried a<br/>great weight of terror. Some of the men who had been to field-work<br/>on the far side of the Admiral Benbow remembered, besides, to have<br/>seen several strangers on the road, and taking them to be<br/>smugglers, to have bolted away; and one at least had seen a little<br/>lugger in what we called Kitt's Hole. For that matter, anyone who<br/>was a comrade of the captain's was enough to frighten them to<br/>death. And the short and the long of the matter was, that while we<br/>could get several who were willing enough to ride to Dr. Livesey's,<br/>which lay in another direction, not one would help us to defend the<br/>inn.<br/><br/>They say cowardice is infectious; but then argument is, on the<br/>other hand, a great emboldener; and so when each had said his say,<br/>my mother made them a speech. She would not, she declared, lose<br/>money that belonged to her fatherless boy; "If none of the rest of<br/>you dare," she said, "Jim and I dare. Back we will go, the way we<br/>came, and small thanks to you big, hulking, chicken-hearted men.<br/>We'll have that chest open, if we die for it. And I'll thank you<br/>for that bag, Mrs. Crossley, to bring back our lawful money<br/>in."<br/><br/>Of course I said I would go with my mother, and of course they<br/>all cried out at our foolhardiness, but even then not a man would<br/>go along with us. All they would do was to give me a loaded pistol<br/>lest we were attacked, and to promise to have horses ready saddled<br/>in case we were pursued on our return, while one lad was to ride<br/>forward to the doctor's in search of armed assistance.<br/><br/>My heart was beating finely when we two set forth in the cold<br/>night upon this dangerous venture. A full moon was beginning to<br/>rise and peered redly through the upper edges of the fog, and this<br/>increased our haste, for it was plain, before we came forth again,<br/>that all would be as bright as day, and our departure exposed to<br/>the eyes of any watchers. We slipped along the hedges, noiseless<br/>and swift, nor did we see or hear anything to increase our terrors,<br/>till, to our relief, the door of the Admiral Benbow had closed<br/>behind us.<br/><br/>
