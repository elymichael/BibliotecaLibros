He had pitched, as I have said, against the bulwarks, where he
lay like some horrible, ungainly sort of puppet, life-size, indeed,
but how different from life's colour or life's comeliness! In that
position I could easily have my way with him, and as the habit of
tragical adventures had worn off almost all my terror for the dead,
I took him by the waist as if he had been a sack of bran and with
one good heave, tumbled him overboard. He went in with a sounding
plunge; the red cap came off and remained floating on the surface;
and as soon as the splash subsided, I could see him and Israel
lying side by side, both wavering with the tremulous movement of
the water. O'Brien, though still quite a young man, was very bald.
There he lay, with that bald head across the knees of the man who
had killed him and the quick fishes steering to and fro over
both.

I was now alone upon the ship; the tide had just turned. The sun
was within so few degrees of setting that already the shadow of the
pines upon the western shore began to reach right across the
anchorage and fall in patterns on the deck. The evening breeze had
sprung up, and though it was well warded off by the hill with the
two peaks upon the east, the cordage had begun to sing a little
softly to itself and the idle sails to rattle to and fro.

I began to see a danger to the ship. The jibs I speedily doused
and brought tumbling to the deck, but the main-sail was a harder
matter. Of course, when the schooner canted over, the boom had
swung out-board, and the cap of it and a foot or two of sail hung
even under water. I thought this made it still more dangerous; yet
the strain was so heavy that I half feared to meddle. At last I got
my knife and cut the halyards. The peak dropped instantly, a great
belly of loose canvas floated broad upon the water, and since, pull
as I liked, I could not budge the downhall, that was the extent of
what I could accomplish. For the rest, the Hispaniola must trust to
luck, like myself.

By this time the whole anchorage had fallen into shadowâ€”the last
rays, I remember, falling through a glade of the wood and shining
bright as jewels on the flowery mantle of the wreck. It began to be
chill; the tide was rapidly fleeting seaward, the schooner settling
more and more on her beam-ends.

I scrambled forward and looked over. It seemed shallow enough,
and holding the cut hawser in both hands for a last security, I let
myself drop softly overboard. The water scarcely reached my waist;
the sand was firm and covered with ripple marks, and I waded ashore
in great spirits, leaving the Hispaniola on her side, with her
main-sail trailing wide upon the surface of the bay. About the same
time, the sun went fairly down and the breeze whistled low in the
dusk among the tossing pines.

At least, and at last, I was off the sea, nor had I returned
thence empty-handed. There lay the schooner, clear at last from
buccaneers and ready for our own men to board and get to sea again.
I had nothing nearer my fancy than to get home to the stockade and
boast of my achievements. Possibly I might be blamed a bit for my
truantry, but the recapture of the Hispaniola was a clenching
answer, and I hoped that even Captain Smollett would confess I had
not lost my time.

So thinking, and in famous spirits, I began to set my face
homeward for the block house and my companions. I remembered that
the most easterly of the rivers which drain into Captain Kidd's
anchorage ran from the two-peaked hill upon my left, and I bent my
course in that direction that I might pass the stream while it was
small. The wood was pretty open, and keeping along the lower spurs,
I had soon turned the corner of that hill, and not long after waded
to the mid-calf across the watercourse.

This brought me near to where I had encountered Ben Gunn, the
maroon; and I walked more circumspectly, keeping an eye on every
side. The dusk had come nigh hand completely, and as I opened out
the cleft between the two peaks, I became aware of a wavering glow
against the sky, where, as I judged, the man of the island was
cooking his supper before a roaring fire. And yet I wondered, in my
heart, that he should show himself so careless. For if I could see
this radiance, might it not reach the eyes of Silver himself where
he camped upon the shore among the marshes?

Gradually the night fell blacker; it was all I could do to guide
myself even roughly towards my destination; the double hill behind
me and the Spy-glass on my right hand loomed faint and fainter; the
stars were few and pale; and in the low ground where I wandered I
kept tripping among bushes and rolling into sandy pits.

Suddenly a kind of brightness fell about me. I looked up; a pale
glimmer of moonbeams had alighted on the summit of the Spy-glass,
and soon after I saw something broad and silvery moving low down
behind the trees, and knew the moon had risen.

With this to help me, I passed rapidly over what remained to me
of my journey, and sometimes walking, sometimes running,
impatiently drew near to the stockade. Yet, as I began to thread
the grove that lies before it, I was not so thoughtless but that I
slacked my pace and went a trifle warily. It would have been a poor
end of my adventures to get shot down by my own party in
mistake.
