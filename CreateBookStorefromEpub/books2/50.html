<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>7<br/>A<br/>Young Man Bent on a Career<br/><br/><br/>ALYOSHA helped Father Zossima to his bedroom and seated him on<br/>his bed. It was a little room furnished with the bare necessities.<br/>There was a narrow iron bedstead, with a strip of felt for a<br/>mattress. In the corner, under the ikons, was a reading-desk with a<br/>cross and the Gospel lying on it. The elder sank exhausted on the<br/>bed. His eyes glittered and he breathed hard. He looked intently at<br/>Alyosha, as though considering something.<br/><br/>"Go, my dear boy, go. Porfiry is enough for me. Make haste, you<br/>are needed there, go and wait at the Father Superior's table."<br/><br/>"Let me stay here," Alyosha entreated.<br/><br/>"You are more needed there. There is no peace there. You will<br/>wait, and be of service. If evil spirits rise up, repeat a prayer.<br/>And remember, my son"- the elder liked to call him that- "this is<br/>not the place for you in the future. When it is God's will to call<br/>me, leave the monastery. Go away for good."<br/><br/>Alyosha started.<br/><br/>"What is it? This is not your place for the time. I bless you<br/>for great service in the world. Yours will be a long pilgrimage.<br/>And you will have to take a wife, too. You will have to bear all<br/>before you come back. There will be much to do. But I don't doubt<br/>of you, and so I send you forth. Christ is with you. Do not abandon<br/>Him and He will not abandon you. You will see great sorrow, and in<br/>that sorrow you will be happy. This is my last message to you: in<br/>sorrow seek happiness. Work, work unceasingly. Remember my words,<br/>for although I shall talk with you again, not only my days but my<br/>hours are numbered."<br/><br/>Alyosha's face again betrayed strong emotion. The corners of his<br/>mouth quivered.<br/>
