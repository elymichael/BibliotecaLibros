Distrust the worthless, lying crowd,<br/><br/>And lay aside thy doubts. I'm not drinking, I'm only<br/>'indulging,' as that pig, your Rakitin, says. He'll be a civil<br/>councillor one day, but he'll always talk about 'indulging.' Sit<br/>down. I could take you in my arms, Alyosha, and press you to my<br/>bosom till I crush you, for in the whole world- in reality- in<br/>real-i-ty- (can you take it in?) I love no one but you!<br/><br/>He uttered the last words in a sort of exaltation.<br/><br/>"No one but you and one 'jade' I have fallen in love with, to my<br/>ruin. But being in love doesn't mean loving. You may be in love<br/>with a woman and yet hate her. Remember that! I can talk about it<br/>gaily still. Sit down here by the table and I'll sit beside you and<br/>look at you, and go on talking. You shall keep quiet and I'll go on<br/>talking, for the time has come. But on reflection, you know, I'd<br/>better speak quietly, for here- here- you can never tell what ears<br/>are listening. I will explain everything; as they say, 'the story<br/>will be continued.' Why have I been longing for you? Why have I<br/>been thirsting for you all these days, and just now? (It's five<br/>days since I've cast anchor here.) Because it's only to you I can<br/>tell everything; because I must, because I need you, because<br/>to-morrow I shall fly from the clouds, because to-morrow life is<br/>ending and beginning. Have you ever felt, have you ever dreamt of<br/>falling down a precipice into a pit? That's just how I'm falling,<br/>but not in a dream. And I'm not afraid, and don't you be afraid. At<br/>least, I am afraid, but I enjoy it. It's not enjoyment though, but<br/>ecstasy. Damn it all, whatever it is! A strong spirit, a weak<br/>spirit, a womanish spirit- what, ever it is! Let us praise nature:<br/>you see what sunshine, how clear the sky is, the leaves are all<br/>green, it's still summer; four o'clock in the afternoon and the<br/>stillness! Where were you going?"<br/><br/>"I was going to father's, but I meant to go to Katerina<br/>Ivanovna's first."<br/><br/>"To her, and to father! Oo! what a coincidence! Why was I<br/>waiting for you? Hungering and thirsting for you in every cranny of<br/>my soul and even in my ribs? Why, to send you to father and to her,<br/>Katerina Ivanovna, so as to have done with her and with father. To<br/>send an angel. I might have sent anyone, but I wanted to send an<br/>angel. And here you are on your way to see father and her."<br/><br/>"Did you really mean to send me?" cried Alyosha with a<br/>distressed expression.<br/><br/>"Stay! You knew it And I see you understand it all at once. But<br/>be quiet, be quiet for a time. Don't be sorry, and don't cry."<br/><br/>Dmitri stood up, thought a moment, and put his finger to his<br/>forehead.<br/><br/>"She's asked you, written to you a letter or something, that's<br/>why you're going to her? You wouldn't be going except for<br/>that?"<br/><br/>"Here is her note." Alyosha took it out of his pocket. Mitya<br/>looked through it quickly.<br/>
