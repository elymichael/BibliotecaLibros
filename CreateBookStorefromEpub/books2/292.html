"Don't dare to do such a thing!" cried Pyotr Ilyitch. "I won't<br/>have it in my house, it's a bad, demoralising habit. Put your money<br/>away. Here, put it here, why waste it? It would come in handy<br/>to-morrow, and I dare say you'll be coming to me to borrow ten<br/>roubles again. Why do you keep putting the notes in your side<br/>pocket? Ah, you'll lose them!"<br/><br/>"I say, my dear fellow, let's go to Mokroe together."<br/><br/>"What should I go for?"<br/><br/>"I say, let's open a bottle at once, and drink to life! I want<br/>to drink, and especially to drink with you. I've never drunk with<br/>you, have I?"<br/><br/>"Very well, we can go to the Metropolis. I was just going<br/>there."<br/><br/>"I haven't time for that. Let's drink at the Plotnikovs', in the<br/>back room. Shall I ask you a riddle?"<br/><br/>"Ask away."<br/><br/>Mitya took the piece of paper out of his waistcoat pocket,<br/>unfolded it and showed it. In a large, distinct hand was written:<br/>"I punish myself for my whole life; my whole life I punish!"<br/><br/>"I will certainly speak to someone. I'll go at once," said Pyotr<br/>Ilyitch, after reading the paper.<br/><br/>"You won't have time, dear boy, come and have a drink.<br/>March!"<br/><br/>Plotnikov's shop was at the corner of the street, next door but<br/>one to Pyotr Ilyitch's. It was the largest grocery shop in our<br/>town, and by no means a bad one, belonging to some rich merchants.<br/>They kept everything that could be got in a Petersburg shop,<br/>grocery of all sort, wines "bottled by the brothers Eliseyev,"<br/>fruits, cigars, tea, coffee, sugar, and so on. There were three<br/>shop-assistants and two errand boys always employed. Though our<br/>part of the country had grown poorer, the landowners had gone away,<br/>and trade had got worse, yet the grocery stores flourished as<br/>before, every year with increasing prosperity; there were plenty of<br/>purchasers for their goods.<br/>
