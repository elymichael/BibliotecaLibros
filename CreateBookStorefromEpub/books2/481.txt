"Why does he come here so often? Surely you are not such great
friends?" asked Alyosha. He, too, nodded at the door through which
Rakitin had disappeared.

"Great friends with Rakitin? No, not as much as that. Is it
likely- a pig like that? He considers I am… a blackguard. They
can't understand a joke either, that's the worst of such people.
They never understand a joke, and their souls are dry, dry and
flat; they remind me of prison walls when I was first brought here.
But he is a clever fellow, very clever. Well, Alexey, it's all over
with me now."

He sat down on the bench and made Alyosha sit down beside
him.

"Yes, the trial's to-morrow. Are you so hopeless, brother?"
Alyosha said, with an apprehensive feeling.

"What are you talking about?" said Mitya, looking at him rather
uncertainly. "Oh, you mean the trial! Damn it all! Till now we've
been talking of things that don't matter, about this trial, but I
haven't said a word to you about the chief thing. Yes, the trial is
to-morrow; but it wasn't the trial I meant, when I said it was all
over with me. Why do you look at me so critically?"

"What do you mean, Mitya?"

"Ideas, ideas, that's all! Ethics! What is ethics?"

"Ethics?" asked Alyosha, wondering.

"Yes; is it a science?"

"Yes, there is such a science… but… I confess I can't explain to
you what sort of science it is."
