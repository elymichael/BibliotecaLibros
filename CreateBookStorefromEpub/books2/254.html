<br/>"We are rejoicing," the little, thin old man went on. "We are<br/>drinking the new wine, the wine of new, great gladness; do you see<br/>how many guests? Here are the bride and bridegroom, here is the<br/>wise governor of the feast, he is tasting the new wine. Why do you<br/>wonder at me? I gave an onion to a beggar, so I, too, am here. And<br/>many here have given only an onion each- only one little onion… .<br/>What are all our deeds? And you, my gentle one, you, my kind boy,<br/>you too have known how to give a famished woman an onion to-day.<br/>Begin your work, dear one, begin it, gentle one! Do you see our<br/>Sun, do you see Him?"<br/><br/>"I am afraid… I dare not look," whispered Alyosha.<br/><br/>"Do not fear Him. He is terrible in His greatness, awful in His<br/>sublimity, but infinitely merciful. He has made Himself like unto<br/>us from love and rejoices with us. He is changing the water into<br/>wine that the gladness of the guests may not be cut short. He is<br/>expecting new guests, He is calling new ones unceasingly for ever<br/>and ever… . There they are bringing new wine. Do you see they are<br/>bringing the vessels… "<br/><br/>Something glowed in Alyosha's heart, something filled it till it<br/>ached, tears of rapture rose from his soul… . He stretched out his<br/>hands, uttered a cry and waked up.<br/><br/>Again the coffin, the open window, and the soft, solemn,<br/>distinct reading of the Gospel. But Alyosha did not listen to the<br/>reading. It was strange, he had fallen asleep on his knees, but now<br/>he was on his feet, and suddenly, as though thrown forward, with<br/>three firm rapid steps he went right up to the coffin. His shoulder<br/>brushed against Father Paissy without his noticing it. Father<br/>Paissy raised his eyes for an instant from his book, but looked<br/>away again at once, seeing that something strange was happening to<br/>the boy. Alyosha gazed for half a minute at the coffin, at the<br/>covered, motionless dead man that lay in the coffin, with the ikon<br/>on his breast and the peaked cap with the octangular cross on his<br/>head. He had only just been hearing his voice, and that voice was<br/>still ringing in his ears. He was listening, still expecting other<br/>words, but suddenly he turned sharply and went out of the cell.<br/><br/>He did not stop on the steps either, but went quickly down; his<br/>soul, overflowing with rapture, yearned for freedom, space,<br/>openness. The vault of heaven, full of soft, shining stars,<br/>stretched vast and fathomless above him. The Milky Way ran in two<br/>pale streams from the zenith to the horizon. The fresh, motionless,<br/>still night enfolded the earth. The white towers and golden domes<br/>of the cathedral gleamed out against the sapphire sky. The gorgeous<br/>autumn flowers, in the beds round the house, were slumbering till<br/>morning. The silence of earth seemed to melt into the silence of<br/>the heavens. The mystery of earth was one with the mystery of the<br/>stars… .<br/><br/>Alyosha stood, gazed, and suddenly threw himself down on the<br/>earth. He did not know why he embraced it. He could not have told<br/>why he longed so irresistibly to kiss it, to kiss it all. But he<br/>kissed it weeping, sobbing, and watering it with his tears, and<br/>vowed passionately to love it, to love it for ever and ever. "Water<br/>the earth with the tears of your joy and love those tears," echoed<br/>in his soul.<br/><br/>What was he weeping over?<br/><br/>Oh! in his rapture he was weeping even over those stars, which<br/>were shining to him from the abyss of space, and "he was not<br/>ashamed of that ecstasy." There seemed to be threads from all those<br/>innumerable worlds of God, linking his soul to them, and it was<br/>trembling all over "in contact with other worlds." He longed to<br/>forgive everyone and for everything, and to beg forgiveness. Oh,<br/>not for himself, but for all men, for all and for everything. "And<br/>others are praying for me too," echoed again in his soul. But with<br/>every instant he felt clearly and, as it were, tangibly, that<br/>something firm and unshakable as that vault of heaven had entered<br/>into his soul. It was as though some idea had seized the<br/>sovereignty of his mind- and it was for all his life and for ever<br/>and ever. He had fallen on the earth a weak boy, but he rose up a<br/>resolute champion, and he knew and felt it suddenly at the very<br/>moment of his ecstasy. And never, never, his life long, could<br/>Alyosha forget that minute.<br/><br/>"Someone visited my soul in that hour," he used to say<br/>afterwards, with implicit faith in his words.<br/><br/>
