"Let's go to Grushenka," Alyosha answered calmly, at once, and<br/>this prompt and calm agreement was such a surprise to Rakitin that<br/>he almost started back.<br/><br/>"Well! I say!" he cried in amazement, but seizing Alyosha firmly<br/>by the arm be led him along the path, still dreading that he would<br/>change his mind.<br/><br/>They walked along in silence; Rakitin was positively afraid to<br/>talk.<br/><br/>"And how glad she will be, how delighted!" he muttered, but<br/>lapsed into silence again.

His object in this case was twofold, first a revengeful<br/>desire to see "the downfall of the righteous," and Alyosha's fall<br/>"from the saints to the sinners," over which he was already<br/>gloating in his imagination, and in the second place he had in view<br/>a certain material gain for himself, of which more will be said<br/>later.<br/><br/>"So the critical moment has come," he thought to himself with<br/>spiteful glee, "and we shall catch it on the hop, for it's just<br/>what we want."<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
