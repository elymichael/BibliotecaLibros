<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>3<br/>Ilusha's Funeral. The Speech at the Stone<br/><br/><br/>HE really was late. They had waited for him and had already<br/>decided to bear the pretty flower-decked little coffin to the<br/>church without him. It was the coffin of poor little Ilusha. He had<br/>died two days after Mitya was sentenced. At the gate of the house<br/>Alyosha was met by the shouts of the boys, Ilusha's schoolfellows.<br/>They had all been impatiently expecting him and were glad that he<br/>had come at last. There were about twelve of them, they all had<br/>their school-bags or satchels on their shoulders. "Father will cry,<br/>be with father," Ilusha had told them as he lay dying, and the boys<br/>remembered it. Kolya Krassotkin was the foremost of them.<br/><br/>"How glad I am you've come, Karamazov!" he cried, holding out<br/>his hand to Alyosha. "It's awful here. It's really horrible to see<br/>it. Snegiryov is not drunk, we know for a fact he's had nothing to<br/>drink to-day, but he seems as if he were drunkâ€¦ I am always manly,<br/>but this is awful. Karamazov, if I am not keeping you, one question<br/>before you go in?"<br/><br/>"What is it, Kolya?" said Alyosha.<br/><br/>"Is your brother innocent or guilty? Was it he killed your<br/>father or was it the valet? As you say, so it will be. I haven't<br/>slept for the last four nights for thinking of it."<br/><br/>"The valet killed him, my brother is innocent," answered<br/>Alyosha.<br/><br/>"That's what I said," cried Smurov.<br/><br/>"So he will perish an innocent victim!" exclaimed Kolya; "though<br/>he is ruined he is happy! I could envy him!"<br/>
