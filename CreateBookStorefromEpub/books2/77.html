<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>5<br/>The Confession of a Passionate Heart- "Heels Up"<br/><br/><br/>"NOW," said Alyosha, "I understand the first half."<br/><br/>"You understand the first half. That half is a drama, and it was<br/>played out there. The second half is a tragedy, and it is being<br/>acted here."<br/><br/>"And I understand nothing of that second half so far," said<br/>Alyosha.<br/><br/>"And I? Do you suppose I understand it?"<br/><br/>"Stop, Dmitri. There's one important question. Tell me, you were<br/>betrothed, betrothed still?"<br/><br/>"We weren't betrothed at once, not for three months after that<br/>adventure. The next day I told myself that the incident was closed,<br/>concluded, that there would be no sequel. It seemed to me caddish<br/>to make her an offer. On her side she gave no sign of life for the<br/>six weeks that she remained in the town; except, indeed, for one<br/>action. The day after her visit the maid-servant slipped round with<br/>an envelope addressed to me. I tore it open; it contained the<br/>change out of the banknote. Only four thousand five hundred roubles<br/>was needed, but there was a discount of about two hundred on<br/>changing it. She only sent me about two hundred and sixty. I don't<br/>remember exactly, but not a note, not a word of explanation. I<br/>searched the packet for a pencil mark n-nothing! Well, I spent the<br/>rest of the money on such an orgy that the new major was obliged to<br/>reprimand me.<br/><br/>"Well, the lieutenant-colonel produced the battalion money, to<br/>the astonishment of everyone, for nobody believed that he had the<br/>money untouched. He'd no sooner paid it than he fell ill, took to<br/>his bed, and, three weeks later, softening of the brain set in, and<br/>he died five days afterwards. He was buried with military honours,<br/>for he had not had time to receive his discharge. Ten days after<br/>his funeral, Katerina Ivanovna, with her aunt and sister, went to<br/>Moscow. And, behold, on the very day they went away (I hadn't seen<br/>them, didn't see them off or take leave) I received a tiny note, a<br/>sheet of thin blue paper, and on it only one line in pencil: 'I<br/>will write to you. Wait. K.' And that was all.<br/>
