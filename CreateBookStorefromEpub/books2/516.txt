"I won't have any lemonade," he said. "Talk of me later. Sit
down and tell me how you did it. Tell me all about it."

"You'd better take off your greatcoat, or you'll be too hot."
Ivan, as though he'd only just thought of it, took off his coat,
and, without getting up from his chair, threw it on the bench.

"Speak, please, speak."

He seemed calmer. He waited, feeling sure that Smerdyakov would
tell him all about it.

"How it was done?" sighed Smerdyakov. "It was done in a most
natural way, following your very words."

"Of my words later," Ivan broke in again, apparently with
complete self-possession, firmly uttering his words, and not
shouting as before. "Only tell me in detail how you did it.
Everything, as it happened. Don't forget anything. The details,
above everything, the details, I beg you."

"You'd gone away, then I fell into the cellar."

"In a fit or in a sham one?"

"A sham one, naturally. I shammed it all. I went quietly down
the steps to the very bottom and lay down quietly, and as I lay
down I gave a scream, and struggled, till they carried me out."

"Stay! And were you shamming all along, afterwards, and in the
hospital?"
