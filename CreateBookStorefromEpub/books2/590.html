It will only be a moment. If you don't<br/>come, he will be in delirium by to-night. I would not tell you a<br/>lie; have pity on him!"<br/><br/>"Have pity on me!" Katya said, with bitter reproach, and she<br/>burst into tears.<br/><br/>"Then you will come," said Alyosha firmly, seeing her tears.<br/>"I'll go and tell him you will come directly."<br/><br/>"No, don't tell him so on any account," cried Katya in alarm. "I<br/>will come, but don't tell him beforehand, for perhaps I may go, but<br/>not go in… I don't know yet-"<br/><br/>Her voice failed her. She gasped for breath. Alyosha got up to<br/>go.<br/><br/>"And what if I meet anyone?" she said suddenly, in a low voice,<br/>turning white again.<br/><br/>"That's just why you must go now, to avoid meeting anyone. There<br/>will be no one there, I can tell you that for certain. We will<br/>expect you," he concluded emphatically, and went out of the<br/>room.<br/><br/><br/>
