"There is something spiteful and yet open-hearted about you,"
Alyosha smiled to her.

"The open-heartedness consists in my not being ashamed of myself
with you. What's more, I don't want to feel ashamed with you, just
with you. Alyosha, why is it I don't respect you? I am very fond of
you, but I don't respect you. If I respected you, I shouldn't talk
to you without shame, should I?"

"No."

"But do you believe that I am not ashamed with you?"

"No, I don't believe it."

Lise laughed nervously again; she spoke rapidly.

"I sent your brother, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, some sweets in
prison. Alyosha, you know, you are quite pretty! I shall love you
awfully for having so quickly allowed me not to love you."

"Why did you send for me to-day, Lise?"

"I wanted to tell you of a longing I have. I should like some
one to torture me, marry me and then torture me, deceive me and go
away. I don't want to be happy."

"You are in love with disorder?"
