The little pig says- umph! umph! umph!

The little calf says- moo, moo, moo,

The little duck says- quack, quack, quack,

The little goose says- ga, ga, ga.

The hen goes strutting through the porch;

Troo-roo-roo-roo-roo, she'll say,

Troo-roo-roo-roo-roo, she'll say!

"Give him something, Mitya," said Grushenka. "Give him a
present, he's poor, you know. Ah, the poor, the insulted!… Do you
know, Mitya, I shall go into a nunnery. No, I really shall one day.
Alyosha said something to me to-day that I shall remember all my
life… . Yes… . But to-day let us dance. To-morrow to the nunnery,
but to-day we'll dance. I want to play to-day, good people, and
what of it? God will forgive us. If I were God, I'd forgive

why am I so good?"

So Grushenka babbled on, getting more and more drunk. At last
she announced that she was going to dance, too. She got up from her
chair, staggering. "Mitya, don't give me any more wine- if I ask
you, don't give it to me. Wine doesn't give peace. Everything's
going round, the stove, and everything. I want to dance. Let
everyone see how I dance… let them see how beautifully I dance…
"

She really meant it. She pulled a white cambric handkerchief out
of her pocket, and took it by one corner in her right hand, to wave
it in the dance. Mitya ran to and fro, the girls were quiet, and
got ready to break into a dancing song at the first signal.
Maximov, hearing that Grushenka wanted to dance, squealed with
delight, and ran skipping about in front of her, humming:
