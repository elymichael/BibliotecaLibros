"Alive? He's alive?" cried Mitya, flinging up his hands. His
face beamed. "Lord, I thank Thee for the miracle Thou has wrought
for me, a sinner and evildoer. That's an answer to my prayer. I've
been praying all night." And he crossed himself three times. He was
almost breathless.

"So from this Grigory we have received such important evidence
concerning you, that-" The prosecutor would have continued, but
Mitya suddenly jumped up from his chair.

"One minute, gentlemen, for God's sake, one minute; I will run
to her-"

"Excuse me, at this moment it's quite impossible," Nikolay
Parfenovitch almost shrieked. He, too, leapt to his feet. Mitya was
seized by the men with the metal plates, but he sat down of his own
accord… .

"Gentlemen, what a pity! I wanted to see her for one minute
only; I wanted to tell her that it has been washed away, it has
gone, that blood that was weighing on my heart all night, and that
I am not a murderer now! Gentlemen, she is my betrothed!" he said
ecstatically and reverently, looking round at them all. "Oh, thank
you, gentlemen! Oh, in one minute you have given me new life, new
heart!… That old man used to carry me in his arms, gentlemen. He
used to wash me in the tub when I was a baby three years old,
abandoned by everyone, he was like a father to me!… "

"And so you-" the investigating lawyer began.

"Allow me, gentlemen, allow me one minute more," interposed
Mitya, putting his elbows on the table and covering his face with
his hands. "Let me have a moment to think, let me breathe,
gentlemen. All this is horribly upsetting, horribly. A man is not a
drum, gentlemen!"

"Drink a little more water," murmured Nikolay Parfenovitch.
Mitya took his hands from his face and laughed. His eyes were
confident. He seemed completely transformed in a moment. His whole
bearing was changed; he was once more the equal of these men, with
all of whom he was acquainted, as though they had all met the day
before, when nothing had happened, at some social gathering. We may
note in passing that, on his first arrival, Mitya had been made
very welcome at the police captain's, but later, during the last
month especially, Mitya had hardly called at all, and when the
police captain met him, in the street, for instance, Mitya noticed
that he frowned and only bowed out of politeness. His acquaintance
with the prosecutor was less intimate, though he sometimes paid his
wife, a nervous and fanciful lady, visits of politeness, without
quite knowing why, and she always received him graciously and had,
for some reason, taken an interest in him up to the last. He had
not had time to get to know the investigating lawyer, though he had
met him and talked to him twice, each time about the fair sex.

"You're a most skilful lawyer, I see, Nikolay Parfenovitch,"
cried Mitya, laughing gaily, "but I can help you now. Oh,
gentlemen, I feel like a new man, and don't be offended at my
addressing you so simply and directly. I'm rather drunk, too, I'll
tell you that frankly. I believe I've had the honour and pleasure
of meeting you, Nikolay Parfenovitch, at my kinsman Miusov's.
Gentlemen, gentlemen, I don't pretend to be on equal terms with
you. I understand, of course, in what character I am sitting before
you. Oh, of course, there's a horrible suspicion… hanging over me…
if Grigory has given evidence… . A horrible suspicion! It's awful,
awful, I understand that! But to business, gentlemen, I am ready,
and we will make an end of it in one moment; for, listen, listen,
gentlemen! Since I know I'm innocent, we can put an end to it in a
minute. Can't we? Can't we?"

Mitya spoke much and quickly, nervously and effusively, as
though he positively took his listeners to be his best friends.

"So, for the present, we will write that you absolutely deny the
charge brought against you," said Nikolay Parfenovitch,
impressively, and bending down to the secretary he dictated to him
in an undertone what to write.
