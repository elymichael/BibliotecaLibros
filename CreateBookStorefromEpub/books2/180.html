"What do you know?"<br/><br/>"I understand nothing," Ivan went on, as though in delirium. "I<br/>don't want to understand anything now. I want to stick to the fact.<br/>I made up my mind long ago not to understand. If I try to<br/>understand anything, I shall be false to the fact, and I have<br/>determined to stick to the fact."<br/><br/>"Why are you trying me?" Alyosha cried, with sudden distress.<br/>"Will you say what you mean at last?"<br/><br/>"Of course, I will; that's what I've been leading up to. You are<br/>dear to me, I don't want to let you go, and I won't give you up to<br/>your Zossima."<br/><br/>Ivan for a minute was silent, his face became all at once very<br/>sad.<br/><br/>"Listen! I took the case of children only to make my case<br/>clearer. Of the other tears of humanity with which the earth is<br/>soaked from its crust to its centre, I will say nothing. I have<br/>narrowed my subject on purpose. I am a bug, and I recognise in all<br/>humility that I cannot understand why the world is arranged as it<br/>is. Men are themselves to blame, I suppose; they were given<br/>paradise, they wanted freedom, and stole fire from heaven, though<br/>they knew they would become unhappy, so there is no need to pity<br/>them. With my pitiful, earthly, Euclidian understanding, all I know<br/>is that there is suffering and that there are none guilty; that<br/>cause follows effect, simply and directly; that everything flows<br/>and finds its level- but that's only Euclidian nonsense, I know<br/>that, and I can't consent to live by it! What comfort is it to me<br/>that there are none guilty and that cause follows effect simply and<br/>directly, and that I know it?- I must have justice, or I will<br/>destroy myself. And not justice in some remote infinite time and<br/>space, but here on earth, and that I could see myself. I have<br/>believed in it. I want to see it, and if I am dead by then, let me<br/>rise again, for if it all happens without me, it will be too<br/>unfair. Surely I haven't suffered simply that I, my crimes and my<br/>sufferings, may manure the soil of the future harmony for somebody<br/>else. I want to see with my own eyes the hind lie down with the<br/>lion and the victim rise up and embrace his murderer. I want to be<br/>there when everyone suddenly understands what it has all been for.<br/>All the religions of the world are built on this longing, and I am<br/>a believer. But then there are the children, and what am I to do<br/>about them? That's a question I can't answer. For the hundredth<br/>time I repeat, there are numbers of questions, but I've only taken<br/>the children, because in their case what I mean is so unanswerably<br/>clear. Listen! If all must suffer to pay for the eternal harmony,<br/>what have children to do with it, tell me, please? It's beyond all<br/>comprehension why they should suffer, and why they should pay for<br/>the harmony. Why should they, too, furnish material to enrich the<br/>soil for the harmony of the future? I understand solidarity in sin<br/>among men. I understand solidarity in retribution, too; but there<br/>can be no such solidarity with children. And if it is really true<br/>that they must share responsibility for all their fathers' crimes,<br/>such a truth is not of this world and is beyond my comprehension.<br/>Some jester will say, perhaps, that the child would have grown up<br/>and have sinned, but you see he didn't grow up, he was torn to<br/>pieces by the dogs, at eight years old. Oh, Alyosha, I am not<br/>blaspheming! I understand, of course, what an upheaval of the<br/>universe it will be when everything in heaven and earth blends in<br/>one hymn of praise and everything that lives and has lived cries<br/>aloud: 'Thou art just, O Lord, for Thy ways are revealed.' When the<br/>mother embraces the fiend who threw her child to the dogs, and all<br/>three cry aloud with tears, 'Thou art just, O Lord!' then, of<br/>course, the crown of knowledge will be reached and all will be made<br/>clear. But what pulls me up here is that I can't accept that<br/>harmony. And while I am on earth, I make haste to take my own<br/>measures. You see, Alyosha, perhaps it really may happen that if I<br/>live to that moment, or rise again to see it, I, too, perhaps, may<br/>cry aloud with the rest, looking at the mother embracing the<br/>child's torturer, 'Thou art just, O Lord!' but I don't want to cry<br/>aloud then. While there is still time, I hasten to protect myself,<br/>and so I renounce the higher harmony altogether. It's not worth the<br/>tears of that one tortured child who beat itself on the breast with<br/>its little fist and prayed in its stinking outhouse, with its<br/>unexpiated tears to 'dear, kind God'! It's not worth it, because<br/>those tears are unatoned for. They must be atoned for, or there can<br/>be no harmony. But how? How are you going to atone for them? Is it<br/>possible? By their being avenged? But what do I care for avenging<br/>them? What do I care for a hell for oppressors? What good can hell<br/>do, since those children have already been tortured? And what<br/>becomes of harmony, if there is hell? I want to forgive. I want to<br/>embrace. I don't want more suffering. And if the sufferings of<br/>children go to swell the sum of sufferings which was necessary to<br/>pay for truth, then I protest that the truth is not worth such a<br/>price. I don't want the mother to embrace the oppressor who threw<br/>her son to the dogs! She dare not forgive him! Let her forgive him<br/>for herself, if she will, let her forgive the torturer for the<br/>immeasurable suffering of her mother's heart. But the sufferings of<br/>her tortured child she has no right to forgive; she dare not<br/>forgive the torturer, even if the child were to forgive him! And if<br/>that is so, if they dare not forgive, what becomes of harmony? Is<br/>there in the whole world a being who would have the right to<br/>forgive and could forgive? I don't want harmony. From love for<br/>humanity I don't want it. I would rather be left with the unavenged<br/>suffering. I would rather remain with my unavenged suffering and<br/>unsatisfied indignation, even if I were wrong. Besides, too high a<br/>price is asked for harmony; it's beyond our means to pay so much to<br/>enter on it. And so I hasten to give back my entrance ticket, and<br/>if I am an honest man I am bound to give it back as soon as<br/>possible. And that I am doing. It's not God that I don't accept,<br/>Alyosha, only I most respectfully return him the ticket."<br/><br/>"That's rebellion," murmered Alyosha, looking down.<br/><br/>"Rebellion? I am sorry you call it that," said Ivan earnestly.<br/>"One can hardly live in rebellion, and I want to live. Tell me<br/>yourself, I challenge your answer. Imagine that you are creating a<br/>fabric of human destiny with the object of making men happy in the<br/>end, giving them peace and rest at last, but that it was essential<br/>and inevitable to torture to death only one tiny creature- that<br/>baby beating its breast with its fist, for instance- and to found<br/>that edifice on its unavenged tears, would you consent to be the<br/>architect on those conditions? Tell me, and tell the truth."<br/><br/>"No, I wouldn't consent," said Alyosha softly.<br/><br/>"And can you admit the idea that men for whom you are building<br/>it would agree to accept their happiness on the foundation of the<br/>unexpiated blood of a little victim? And accepting it would remain<br/>happy for ever?"<br/><br/>"No, I can't admit it. Brother," said Alyosha suddenly, with<br/>flashing eyes, "you said just now, is there a being in the whole<br/>world who would have the right to forgive and could forgive? But<br/>there is a Being and He can forgive everything, all and for all,<br/>because He gave His innocent blood for all and everything. You have<br/>forgotten Him, and on Him is built the edifice, and it is to Him<br/>they cry aloud, 'Thou art just, O Lord, for Thy ways are<br/>revealed!'<br/>
