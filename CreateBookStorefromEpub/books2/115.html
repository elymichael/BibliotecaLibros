"Here I've written you a love-letter. Oh, dear, what have I<br/>done? Alyosha, don't despise me, and if I've done something very<br/>horrid and wounded you, forgive me. Now the secret of my<br/>reputation, ruined perhaps for ever, is in your hands.<br/><br/>"I shall certainly cry to-day. Good-bye till our meeting, our<br/>awful meeting.- Lise.<br/><br/>"P.S.- Alyosha! You must, must, must come!- Lise.<br/><br/>Alyosha read the note in amazement, read it through twice,<br/>thought a little, and suddenly laughed a soft, sweet laugh. He<br/>started. That laugh seemed to him sinful. But a minute later he<br/>laughed again just as softly and happily. He slowly replaced the<br/>note in the envelope, crossed himself and lay down. The agitation<br/>in his heart passed at once. "God, have mercy upon all of them,<br/>have all these unhappy and turbulent souls in Thy keeping, and set<br/>them in the right path. All ways are Thine. Save them according to<br/>Thy wisdom. Thou art love. Thou wilt send joy to all!" Alyosha<br/>murmured, crossing himself, and falling into peaceful sleep.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
