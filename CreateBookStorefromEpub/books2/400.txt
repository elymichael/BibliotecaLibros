"Did he say it to you alone once, or several times?" inquired
the prosecutor, and learned that he had told Grushenka so several
times.

Ippolit Kirillovitch was very well satisfied with this piece of
evidence. Further examination elicited that Grushenka knew, too,
where that money had come from, and that Dmitri Fyodorovitch had
got it from Katerina Ivanovna.

"And did you never, once, hear that the money spent a month ago
was not three thousand, but less, and that Dmitri Fyodorovitch had
saved half that sum for his own use?"

"No, I never heard that," answered Grushenka.

It was explained further that Mitya had, on the contrary, often
told her that he hadn't a farthing.

"He was always expecting to get some from his father," said
Grushenka in conclusion.

"Did he never say before youâ€¦ casually, or in a moment of
irritation," Nikolay Parfenovitch put in suddenly, "that he
intended to make an attempt on his father's life?"

"Ach, he did say so," sighed Grushenka.

"Once or several times?"

"He mentioned it several times, always in anger."
