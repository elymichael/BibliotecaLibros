<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>8<br/>The Evidences of the Witnesses. The Babe<br/><br/><br/>THE examination of the witnesses began. But we will not continue<br/>our story in such detail as before. And so we will not dwell on how<br/>Nikolay Parfenovitch impressed on every witness called that he must<br/>give his evidence in accordance with truth and conscience, and that<br/>he would afterwards have to repeat his evidence on oath, how every<br/>witness was called upon to sign the protocol of his evidence, and<br/>so on. We will only note that the point principally insisted upon<br/>in the examination was the question of the three thousand roubles;<br/>that is, was the sum spent here, at Mokroe, by Mitya on the first<br/>occasion, a month before, three thousand or fifteen hundred? And<br/>again had he spent three thousand or fifteen hundred yesterday?<br/>Alas, all the evidence given by everyone turned out to be against<br/>Mitya. There was not one in his favour, and some witnesses<br/>introduced new, almost crushing facts, in contradiction of his,<br/>Mitya's, story.<br/><br/>The first witness examined was Trifon Borissovitch. He was not<br/>in the least abashed as he stood before the lawyers. He had, on the<br/>contrary, an air of stern and severe indignation with the accused,<br/>which gave him an appearance of truthfulness and personal dignity.<br/>He spoke little, and with reserve, waited to be questioned,<br/>answered precisely and deliberately. Firmly and unhesitatingly he<br/>bore witness that the sum spent a month before could not have been<br/>less than three thousand, that all the peasants about here would<br/>testify that they had heard the sum of three thousand mentioned by<br/>Dmitri Fyodorovitch himself. "What a lot of money he flung away on<br/>the Gypsy girls alone! He wasted a thousand, I daresay, on them<br/>alone."<br/><br/>"I don't believe I gave them five hundred," was Mitya's gloomy<br/>comment on this. "It's a pity I didn't count the money at the time,<br/>but I was drunk… "<br/><br/>Mitya was sitting sideways with his back to the curtains. He<br/>listened gloomily, with a melancholy and exhausted air, as though<br/>he would say:<br/><br/>"Oh, say what you like. It makes no difference now."<br/><br/>"More than a thousand went on them, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,"<br/>retorted Trifon Borissovitch firmly. "You flung it about at random<br/>and they picked it up. They were a rascally, thievish lot,<br/>horse-stealers, they've been driven away from here, or maybe they'd<br/>bear witness themselves how much they got from you. I saw the sum<br/>in your hands, myself- count it I didn't, you didn't let me, that's<br/>true enough- but by the look of it I should say it was far more<br/>than fifteen hundred… fifteen hundred, indeed! We've seen money<br/>too. We can judge of amounts… "<br/><br/>As for the sum spent yesterday he asserted that Dmitri<br/>Fyodorovitch had told him, as soon as he arrived, that he had<br/>brought three thousand with him.<br/>
