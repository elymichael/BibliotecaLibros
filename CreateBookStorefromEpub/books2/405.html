<br/>"The preliminary inquiry is not yet over," Nikolay Parfenovitch<br/>faltered, somewhat embarrassed. "We will continue it in the town,<br/>and I, for my part, of course, am ready to wish you all success… in<br/>your defence… . As a matter of fact, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, I've<br/>always been disposed to regard you as, so to speak, more<br/>unfortunate than guilty. All of us here, if I may make bold to<br/>speak for all, we are all ready to recognise that you are, at<br/>bottom, a young man of honour, but, alas, one who has been carried<br/>away by certain passions to a somewhat excessive degree… "<br/><br/>Nikolay Parfenovitch's little figure was positively majestic by<br/>the time he had finished speaking. It struck Mitya that in another<br/>minute this "boy" would take his arm, lead him to another corner,<br/>and renew their conversation about "girls." But many quite<br/>irrelevant and inappropriate thoughts sometimes occur even to a<br/>prisoner when he is being led out to execution.<br/><br/>"Gentlemen, you are good, you are humane, may I see her to say<br/>'good-bye' for the last time?" asked Mitya.<br/><br/>"Certainly, but considering… in fact, now it's impossible except<br/>in the presence of-"<br/><br/>"Oh, well, if it must be so, it must!"<br/><br/>Grushenka was brought in, but the farewell was brief, and of few<br/>words, and did not at all satisfy Nikolay Parfenovitch. Grushenka<br/>made a deep bow to Mitya.<br/><br/>"I have told you I am yours, and I will be yours. I will follow<br/>you for ever, wherever they may send you. Farewell; you are<br/>guiltless, though you've been your own undoing."<br/><br/>Her lips quivered, tears flowed from her eyes.<br/><br/>"Forgive me, Grusha, for my love, for ruining you, too, with my<br/>love."<br/><br/>Mitya would have said something more, but he broke off and went<br/>out. He was at once surrounded by men who kept a constant watch on<br/>him. At the bottom of the steps to which he had driven up with such<br/>a dash the day before with Andrey's three horses, two carts stood<br/>in readiness. Mavriky Mavrikyevitch, a sturdy, thick-set man with a<br/>wrinkled face, was annoyed about something, some sudden<br/>irregularity. He was shouting angrily. He asked Mitya to get into<br/>the cart with somewhat excessive surliness.<br/><br/>
