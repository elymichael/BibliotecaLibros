"What terrible tragedies real life contrives for people," said<br/>Mitya, in complete despair. The perspiration was streaming down his<br/>face. The priest seized the moment to put before him, very<br/>reasonably, that, even if he succeeded in wakening the man, he<br/>would still be drunk and incapable of conversation. "And your<br/>business is important," he said, "so you'd certainly better put it<br/>off till morning." With a gesture of despair Mitya agreed.<br/><br/>"Father, I will stay here with a light, and seize the favourable<br/>moment. As soon as he wakes I'll begin. I'll pay you for the<br/>light," he said to the forester, "for the night's lodging, too;<br/>you'll remember Dmitri Karamazov. Only Father, I don't know what<br/>we're to do with you. Where will you sleep?"<br/><br/>"No, I'm going home. I'll take his horse and get home," he said,<br/>indicating the forester. "And now I'll say good-bye. I wish you all<br/>success."<br/><br/>So it was settled. The priest rode off on the forester's horse,<br/>delighted to escape, though he shook his head uneasily, wondering<br/>whether he ought not next day to inform his benefactor Fyodor<br/>Pavlovitch of this curious incident, "or he may in an unlucky hour<br/>hear of it, be angry, and withdraw his favour."<br/><br/>The forester, scratching himself, went back to his room without<br/>a word, and Mitya sat on the bench to "catch the favourable<br/>moment," as he expressed it. Profound dejection clung about his<br/>soul like a heavy mist. A profound, intense dejection! He sat<br/>thinking, but could reach no conclusion. The candle burnt dimly, a<br/>cricket chirped; it became insufferably close in the overheated<br/>room. He suddenly pictured the garden, the path behind the garden,<br/>the door of his father's house mysteriously opening and Grushenka<br/>running in. He leapt up from the bench.<br/><br/>"It's a tragedy!" he said, grinding his teeth. Mechanically he<br/>went up to the sleeping man and looked in his face. He was a lean,<br/>middle-aged peasant, with a very long face, flaxen curls, and a<br/>long, thin, reddish beard, wearing a blue cotton shirt and a black<br/>waistcoat, from the pocket of which peeped the chain of a silver<br/>watch. Mitya looked at his face with intense hatred, and for some<br/>unknown reason his curly hair particularly irritated him.<br/><br/>What was insufferably humiliating was that, after leaving things<br/>of such importance and making such sacrifices, he, Mitya, utterly<br/>worn out, should with business of such urgency be standing over<br/>this dolt on whom his whole fate depended, while he snored as<br/>though there were nothing the matter, as though he'd dropped from<br/>another planet.<br/><br/>"Oh, the irony of fate!" cried Mitya, and, quite losing his<br/>head, he fell again to rousing the tipsy peasant. He roused him<br/>with a sort of ferocity, pulled at him, pushed him, even beat him;<br/>but after five minutes of vain exertions, he returned to his bench<br/>in helpless despair, and sat down.<br/><br/>"Stupid! Stupid!" cried Mitya. "And how dishonourable it all<br/>is!" something made him add. His head began to ache horribly.<br/>"Should he fling it up and go away altogether?" he wondered. "No,<br/>wait till to-morrow now. I'll stay on purpose. What else did I come<br/>for? Besides, I've no means of going. How am I to get away from<br/>here now? Oh, the idiocy of it" But his head ached more and more.<br/>He sat without moving, and unconsciously dozed off and fell asleep<br/>as he sat. He seemed to have slept for two hours or more. He was<br/>waked up by his head aching so unbearably that he could have<br/>screamed. There was a hammering in his temples, and the top of his<br/>head ached. It was a long time before he could wake up fully and<br/>understand what had happened to him.<br/><br/>At last he realised that the room was full of charcoal fumes<br/>from the stove, and that he might die of suffocation. And the<br/>drunken peasant still lay snoring. The candle guttered and was<br/>about to go out. Mitya cried out, and ran staggering across the<br/>passage into the forester's room. The forester waked up at once,<br/>but hearing that the other room was full of fumes, to Mitya's<br/>surprise and annoyance, accepted the fact with strange unconcern,<br/>though he did go to see to it.<br/><br/>"But he's dead, he's dead! andâ€¦ what am I to do then?" cried<br/>Mitya frantically.<br/>
