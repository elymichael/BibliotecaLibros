"Looking at you, I have made up my mind."

I looked at him.

"Is it possible," I cried, clasping my hands, "that such a
trivial incident could give rise to a resolution in you?"

"My resolution has been growing for the last three years," he
answered, "and your story only gave the last touch to it. Looking
at you, I reproached myself and envied you." He said this to me
almost sullenly.

"But you won't be believed," I observed; "it's fourteen years
ago."

"I have proofs, great proofs. I shall show them."

Then I cried and kissed him.

"Tell me one thing, one thing," he said (as though it all
depended upon me), "my wife, my children! My wife may die of grief,
and though my children won't lose their rank and property, they'll
be a convict's children and for ever! And what a memory, what a
memory of me I shall leave in their hearts!"

I said nothing.

"And to part from them, to leave them for ever? It's for ever,
you know, for ever!" I sat still and repeated a silent prayer. I
got up at last, I felt afraid.

"Well?" He looked at me.
