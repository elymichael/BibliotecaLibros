"There's nothing to finish. It's all clear. It's the same old<br/>tune, brother. If even you are a sensualist at heart, what of your<br/>brother, Ivan? He's a Karamazov, too. What is at the root of all<br/>you Karamazovs is that you're all sensual, grasping and crazy! Your<br/>brother Ivan writes theological articles in joke, for some idiotic,<br/>unknown motive of his own, though he's an atheist, and he admits<br/>it's a fraud himself- that's your brother Ivan. He's trying to get<br/>Mitya's betrothed for himself, and I fancy he'll succeed, too. And<br/>what's more, it's with Mitya's consent. For Mitya will surrender<br/>his betrothed to him to be rid of her, and escape to Grushenka. And<br/>he's ready to do that in spite of all his nobility and<br/>disinterestedness. Observe that. Those are the most fatal people!<br/>Who the devil can make you out? He recognises his vileness and goes<br/>on with it! Let me tell you, too, the old man, your father, is<br/>standing in Mitya's way now. He has suddenly gone crazy over<br/>Grushenka. His mouth waters at the sight of her. It's simply on her<br/>account he made that scene in the cell just now, simply because<br/>Miusov called her an 'abandoned creature.' He's worse than a<br/>tom-cat in love. At first she was only employed by him in<br/>connection with his taverns and in some other shady business, but<br/>now he has suddenly realised all she is and has gone wild about<br/>her. He keeps pestering her with his offers, not honourable ones,<br/>of course. And they'll come into collision, the precious father and<br/>son, on that path! But Grushenka favours neither of them, she's<br/>still playing with them, and teasing them both, considering which<br/>she can get most out of. For though she could filch a lot of money<br/>from the papa he wouldn't marry her, and maybe he'll turn stingy in<br/>the end, and keep his purse shut. That's where Mitya's value comes<br/>in; he has no money, but he's ready to marry her. Yes, ready to<br/>marry her! to abandon his betrothed, a rare beauty, Katerina<br/>Ivanovna, who's rich, and the daughter of a colonel, and to marry<br/>Grushenka, who has been the mistress of a dissolute old merchant,<br/>Samsonov, a coarse, uneducated, provincial mayor. Some murderous<br/>conflict may well come to pass from all this, and that's what your<br/>brother Ivan is waiting for. It would suit him down to the ground.<br/>He'll carry off Katerina Ivanovna, for whom he is languishing, and<br/>pocket her dowry of sixty thousand. That's very alluring to start<br/>with, for a man of no consequence and a beggar. And, take note, he<br/>won't be wronging Mitya, but doing him the greatest service. For I<br/>know as a fact that Mitya only last week, when he was with some<br/>Gipsy girls drunk in a tavern, cried out aloud that he was unworthy<br/>of his betrothed, Katya, but that his brother Ivan, he was the man<br/>who deserved her. And Katerina Ivanovna will not in the end refuse<br/>such a fascinating man as Ivan. She's hesitating between the two of<br/>them already. And how has that Ivan won you all, so that you all<br/>worship him? He is laughing at you, and enjoying himself at your<br/>expense."<br/><br/>"How do you know? How can you speak so confidently?" Alyosha<br/>asked sharply, frowning.<br/><br/>"Why do you ask, and are frightened at my answer? It shows that<br/>you know I'm speaking the truth."<br/><br/>"You don't like Ivan. Ivan wouldn't be tempted by money."<br/><br/>"Really? And the beauty of Katerina Ivanovna? It's not only the<br/>money, though a fortune of sixty thousand is an attraction."<br/><br/>"Ivan is above that. He wouldn't make up to anyone for<br/>thousands. It is not money, it's not comfort Ivan is seeking.<br/>Perhaps it's suffering he is seeking."<br/><br/>"What wild dream now? Oh, you- aristocrats!"<br/><br/>"Ah, Misha, he has a stormy spirit. His mind is in bondage. He<br/>is haunted by a great, unsolved doubt. He is one of those who don't<br/>want millions, but an answer to their questions."<br/><br/>"That's plagiarism, Alyosha. You're quoting your elder's<br/>phrases. Ah, Ivan has set you a problem!" cried Rakitin, with<br/>undisguised malice. His face changed, and his lips twitched. "And<br/>the problem's a stupid one. It is no good guessing it. Rack your<br/>brains- you'll understand it. His article is absurd and ridiculous.<br/>And did you hear his stupid theory just now: if there's no<br/>immortality of the soul, then there's no virtue, and everything is<br/>lawful. (And by the way, do you remember how your brother Mitya<br/>cried out: 'I will remember!') An attractive theory for<br/>scoundrels!- (I'm being abusive, that's stupid.) Not for<br/>scoundrels, but for pedantic poseurs, 'haunted by profound,<br/>unsolved doubts.' He's showing off, and what it all comes to is,<br/>'on the one hand we cannot but admit' and 'on the other it must be<br/>confessed!' His whole theory is a fraud! Humanity will find in<br/>itself the power to live for virtue even without believing in<br/>immortality. It will find it in love for freedom, for equality, for<br/>fraternity."<br/><br/>Rakitin could hardly restrain himself in his heat, but,<br/>suddenly, as though remembering something, he stopped short.<br/><br/>"Well, that's enough," he said, with a still more crooked smile.<br/>"Why are you laughing? Do you think I'm a vulgar fool?"<br/>
