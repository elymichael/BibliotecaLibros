for I've<br/>made a decision once for all. Forgive me the pun; you'll have to<br/>forgive me a lot more than puns to-day. Don't be uneasy. I'm not<br/>spinning it out. I'm talking sense, and I'll come to the point in a<br/>minute. I won't keep you in suspense. Stay, how does it go?" He<br/>raised his head, thought a minute, and began with enthusiasm:<br/>{verse Wild and fearful in his cavern Hid the naked troglodyte, And<br/>the homeless nomad wandered Laying waste the fertile plain.<br/>Menacing with spear and arrow In the woods the hunter strayedâ€¦ .<br/>Woe to all poor wretches stranded On those cruel and hostile<br/>shores! From the peak of high Olympus Came the mother Ceres down,<br/>Seeking in those savage regions Her lost daughter Proserpine. But<br/>the Goddess found no refuge, Found no kindly welcome there, And no<br/>temple bearing witness To the worship of the gods. From the fields<br/>and from the vineyards Came no fruits to deck the feasts, Only<br/>flesh of bloodstained victims Smouldered on the altar-fires, And<br/>where'er the grieving goddess Turns her melancholy gaze, Sunk in<br/>vilest degradation Man his loathsomeness displays {verse Mitya<br/>broke into sobs and seized Alyosha's hand. "My dear, my dear, in<br/>degradation, in degradation now, too. There's a terrible amount of<br/>suffering for man on earth, a terrible lot of trouble. Don't think<br/>I'm only a brute in an officer's uniform, wallowing in dirt and<br/>drink. I hardly think of anything but of that degraded man- if only<br/>I'm not lying. I pray God I'm not lying and showing off. I think<br/>about that man because I am that man myself. {verse Would he purge<br/>his soul from vileness And attain to light and worth, He must turn<br/>and cling for ever To his ancient Mother Earth. {verse But the<br/>difficulty is how am I to cling for ever to Mother Earth. I don't<br/>kiss her. I don't cleave to her bosom. Am I to become a peasant or<br/>a shepherd? I go on and I don't know whether I'm going to shame or<br/>to light and joy. That's the trouble, for everything in the world<br/>is a riddle! And whenever I've happened to sink into the vilest<br/>degradation (and it's always been happening) I always read that<br/>poem about Ceres and man. Has it reformed me? Never! For I'm a<br/>Karamazov. For when I do leap into the pit, I go headlong with my<br/>heels up, and am pleased to be falling in that degrading attitude,<br/>and pride myself upon it. And in the very depths of that<br/>degradation I begin a hymn of praise. Let me be accursed. Let me be<br/>vile and base, only let me kiss the hem of the veil in which my God<br/>is shrouded. Though I may be following the devil, I am Thy son, O<br/>Lord, and I love Thee, and I feel the joy without which the world<br/>cannot stand. {verse Joy everlasting fostereth The soul of all<br/>creation, It is her secret ferment fires The cup of life with<br/>flame. 'Tis at her beck the grass hath turned Each blade towards<br/>the light And solar systems have evolved From chaos and dark night,<br/>Filling the realms of boundless space Beyond the sage's sight. At<br/>bounteous Nature's kindly breast, All things that breathe drink<br/>Joy, And birds and beasts and creeping things All follow where She<br/>leads. Her gifts to man are friends in need, The wreath, the<br/>foaming must, To angels- vision of God's throne, To insects-<br/>sensual lust. {verse But enough poetry! I am in tears; let me cry.<br/>It may be foolishness that everyone would laugh at. But you won't<br/>laugh. Your eyes are shining, too. Enough poetry. I want to tell<br/>you now about the insects to whom God gave 'sensual lust.' To<br/>insects- sensual lust. I am that insect, brother, and it is said of<br/>me specially. All we Karamazovs are such insects, and, angel as you<br/>are, that insect lives in you, too, and will stir up a tempest in<br/>your blood. Tempests, because sensual lust is a tempest worse than<br/>a tempest! Beauty is a terrible and awful thing! It is terrible<br/>because it has not been fathomed and never can be fathomed, for God<br/>sets us nothing but riddles. Here the boundaries meet and all<br/>contradictions exist side by side. I am a cultivated man, brother,<br/>but I've thought a lot about this. It's terrible what mysteries<br/>there are! Too many riddles weigh men down on earth. We must solve<br/>them as we can, and try to keep a dry skin in the water. Beauty! I<br/>can't endure the thought that a man of lofty mind and heart begins<br/>with the ideal of the Madonna and ends with the ideal of Sodom.<br/>What's still more awful is that a man with the ideal of Sodom in<br/>his soul does not renounce the ideal of the Madonna, and his heart<br/>may be on fire with that ideal, genuinely on fire, just as in his<br/>days of youth and innocence. Yes, man is broad, too broad, indeed.<br/>I'd have him narrower. The devil only knows what to make of it!<br/>What to the mind is shameful is beauty and nothing else to the<br/>heart. Is there beauty in Sodom? Believe me, that for the immense<br/>mass of mankind beauty is found in Sodom. Did you know that secret?<br/>The awful thing is that beauty is mysterious as well as terrible.<br/>God and the devil are fighting there and the battlefield is the<br/>heart of man. But a man always talks of his own ache. Listen, now<br/>to come to facts."<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
