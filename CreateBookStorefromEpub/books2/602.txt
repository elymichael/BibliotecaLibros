religion, that we shall all rise again from the dead and shall live
and see each other again, all, Ilusha too?"

"Certainly we shall all rise again, certainly we shall see each
other and shall tell each other with joy and gladness all that has
happened!" Alyosha answered, half laughing, half enthusiastic.

"Ah, how splendid it will be!" broke from Kolya.

"Well, now we will finish talking and go to his funeral dinner.
Don't be put out at our eating pancakes- it's a very old custom and
there's something nice in that!" laughed Alyosha. "Well, let us go!
And now we go hand in hand."

"And always so, all our lives hand in hand! Hurrah for
Karamazov!" Kolya cried once more rapturously, and once more the
boys took up his exclamation:

"Hurrah for Karamazov!"
