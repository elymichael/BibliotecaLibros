"And I put a rouble on the queen, the queen of hearts, the<br/>pretty little panienotchka<br/>[11]<br/>he! he!"<br/>laughed Maximov, pulling out his queen, and, as though trying to<br/>conceal it from everyone, he moved right up and crossed himself<br/>hurriedly under the table. Mitya won. The rouble won, too. "A<br/>corner!" cried Mitya. "I'll bet another rouble, a 'single' stake,"<br/>Maximov muttered gleefully, hugely delighted at having won a<br/>rouble. "Lost!" shouted Mitya. "A 'double' on the seven!" The seven<br/>too was trumped. "Stop!" cried Kalganov suddenly. "Double! Double!"<br/>Mitya doubled his stakes, and each time he doubled the stake, the<br/>card he doubled was trumped by the Poles. The rouble stakes kept<br/>winning. "On the double!" shouted Mitya furiously. "You've lost two<br/>hundred, panie. Will you stake another hundred?" the Pole on the<br/>sofa inquired. "What? Lost two hundred already? Then another two<br/>hundred! All doubles!" And pulling his money out of his pocket,<br/>Mitya was about to fling two hundred roubles on the queen, but<br/>Kalgonov covered it with his hand. "That's enough!" he shouted in<br/>his ringing voice. "What's the matter?" Mitya stared at him.<br/>"That's enough! I don't want you to play anymore. Don't!" "Why?"<br/>"Because I don't. Hang it, come away. That's why. I won't let you<br/>go on playing." Mitya gazed at him in astonishment. "Give it up,<br/>Mitya. He may be right. You've lost a lot as it is," said<br/>Grushenka, with a curious note in her voice. Both the Poles rose<br/>from their seats with a deeply offended air. "Are you joking,<br/>panie?" said the short man, looking severely at Kalganov. "How dare<br/>you!" Pan Vrublevsky, too, growled at Kalganov. "Don't dare to<br/>shout like that," cried Grushenka. "Ah, you turkey-cocks!" Mitya<br/>looked at each of them in turn. But something in Grushenka's face<br/>suddenly struck him, and at the same instant something new flashed<br/>into his mind- a strange new thought! "Pani Agrippina," the little<br/>Pole was beginning, crimson with anger, when Mitya suddenly went up<br/>to him and slapped him on the shoulder. "Most illustrious, two<br/>words with you."cried Grushenka. "What do you want?" "In the next<br/>room, I've two words to say to you, something pleasant, very<br/>pleasant. You'll be glad to hear it." The little pan was taken<br/>aback and looked apprehensively at Mitya. He agreed at once,<br/>however, on condition that Pan Vrublevsky went with them. "The<br/>bodyguard? Let him come, and I want him, too. I must have him!"<br/>cried Mitya. "March, panovie!" "Where are you going?" asked<br/>Grushenka, anxiously. "We'll be back in one moment," answered<br/>Mitya. There was a sort of boldness, a sudden confidence shining in<br/>his eyes. His face had looked very different when he entered the<br/>room an hour before. He led the Poles, not into the large room<br/>where the chorus of girls was assembling and the table was being<br/>laid, but into the bedroom on the right, where the trunks and<br/>packages were kept, and there were two large beds, with pyramids of<br/>cotton pillows on each. There was a lighted candle on a small deal<br/>table in the corner. The small man and Mitya sat down to this<br/>table, facing each other, while the huge Vrublevsky stood beside<br/>them, his hands behind his back. The Poles looked severe but were<br/>evidently inquisitive. "What can I do for you, panie?" lisped the<br/>little Pole. "Well, look here, panie, I won't keep you long.<br/>There's money for you," he pulled out his notes. "Would you like<br/>three thousand? Take it and go your way." The Pole gazed open-eyed<br/>at Mitya, with a searching look. "Three thousand, panie?" He<br/>exchanged glances with Vrublevsky. "Three, panovie, three! Listen,<br/>panie, I see you're a sensible man. Take three thousand and go to<br/>the devil, and Vrublevsky with you d'you hear? But, at once, this<br/>very minute, and for ever. You understand that, panie, for ever.<br/>Here's the door, you go out of it. What have you got there, a<br/>great-coat, a fur coat? I'll bring it out to you. They'll get the<br/>horses out directly, and then-good-bye, panie!" Mitya awaited an<br/>answer with assurance. He had no doubts. An expression of<br/>extraordinary resolution passed over the Pole's face. "And the<br/>money, panie?" "The money, panie? Five hundred roubles I'll give<br/>you this moment for the journey, and as a first instalment, and two<br/>thousand five hundred to-morrow, in the town- I swear on my honour,<br/>I'll get it, I'll get it at any cost!" cried Mitya. The Poles<br/>exchanged glances again. The short man's face looked more<br/>forbidding. "Seven hundred, seven hundred, not five hundred, at<br/>once, this minute, cash down!" Mitya added, feeling something<br/>wrong. "What's the matter, panie? Don't you trust me? I can't give<br/>you the whole three thousand straight off. If I give it, you may<br/>come back to her to-morrow… . Besides, I haven't the three thousand<br/>with me. I've got it at home in the town," faltered Mitya, his<br/>spirit sinking at every word he uttered. "Upon my word, the money's<br/>there, hidden." In an instant an extraordinary sense of personal<br/>dignity showed itself in the little man's face. "What next?" he<br/>asked ironically. "For shame!" and he spat on the floor. Pan<br/>Vrublevsky spat too. "You do that, panie," said Mitya, recognising<br/>with despair that all was over, "because you hope to make more out<br/>of Grushenka? You're a couple of capons, that's what you are!"<br/>"This is a mortal insult!" The little Pole turned as red as a crab,<br/>and he went out of the room, briskly, as though unwilling to hear<br/>another word. Vrublevsky swung out after him, and Mitya followed,<br/>confused and crestfallen. He was afraid of Grushenka, afraid that<br/>the Pan would at once raise an outcry. And so indeed he did. The<br/>Pole walked into the room and threw himself in a theatrical<br/>attitude before Grushenka. "Pani Agrippina, I have received a<br/>mortal insult!" he exclaimed. But Grushenka suddenly lost all<br/>patience, as though they had wounded her in the tenderest spot.<br/>"Speak Russian! Speak Russian!" she cried, "not another word of<br/>Polish! You used to talk Russian. You can't have forgotten it in<br/>five years." She was red with passion. "Pani Agrippina-" "My name's<br/>Agrafena, Grushenka, speak Russian or I won't listen!" The Pole<br/>gasped with offended dignity, and quickly and pompously delivered<br/>himself in broken Russian: "Pani Agrafena, I came here to forget<br/>the past and forgive it, to forget all that has happened till<br/>to-day-" "Forgive? Came here to forgive me?" Grushenka cut him<br/>short, jumping up from her seat. "Just so, Pani, I'm not<br/>pusillanimous, I'm magnanimous. But I was astounded when I saw your<br/>lovers. Pan Mitya offered me three thousand, in the other room to<br/>depart. I spat in the pan's face." "What? He offered you money for<br/>me?" cried Grushenka, hysterically. "Is it true, Mitya? How dare<br/>you? Am I for sale?" "Panie, panie!" yelled Mitya, "she's pure and<br/>shining, and I have never been her lover! That's a lie… " "How dare<br/>you defend me to him?" shrieked Grushenka. "It wasn't virtue kept<br/>me pure, and it wasn't that I was afraid of Kuzma, but that I might<br/>hold up my head when I met him, and tell him he's a scoundrel. And<br/>he did actually refuse the money?" "He took it! He took it!" cried<br/>Mitya; "only he wanted to get the whole three thousand at once, and<br/>I could only give him seven hundred straight off." "I see: he heard<br/>I had money, and came here to marry me!" "Pani Agrippina!" cried<br/>the little Pole. "I'm- a knight, I'm- a nobleman, and not a lajdak.<br/>I came here to make you my wife and I find you a different woman,<br/>perverse and shameless." "Oh, go back where you came from! I'll<br/>tell them to turn you out and you'll be turned out," cried<br/>Grushenka, furious. "I've been a fool, a fool, to have been<br/>miserable these five years! And it wasn't for his sake, it was my<br/>anger made me miserable. And this isn't he at all! Was he like<br/>this? It might be his father! Where did you get your wig from? He<br/>was a falcon, but this is a gander. He used to laugh and sing to<br/>me… . And I've been crying for five years, damned fool, abject,<br/>shameless I was! She sank back in her low chair and hid her face in<br/>her hands. At that instant the chorus of Mokroe began singing in<br/>the room on the left- a rollicking dance song. "A regular Sodom!"<br/>Vrublevsky roared suddenly. "Landlord, send the shameless hussies<br/>away!" The landlord, who had been for some time past inquisitively<br/>peeping in at the door, hearing shouts and guessing that his guests<br/>were quarrelling, at once entered the room. "What are you shouting<br/>for? D'you want to split your throat?" he said, addressing<br/>Vrublevsky, with surprising rudeness. "Animal!" bellowed Pan<br/>Vrublevsky. "Animal? And what sort of cards were you playing with<br/>just now? I gave you a pack and you hid it. You played with marked<br/>cards! I could send you to Siberia for playing with false cards,<br/>d'you know that, for it's just the same as false banknotes… And<br/>going up to the sofa he thrust his fingers between the sofa back<br/>and the cushion, and pulled out an unopened pack of cards. "Here's<br/>my pack unopened!" He held it up and showed it to all in the room.<br/>"From where I stood I saw him slip my pack away, and put his in<br/>place of it- you're a cheat and not a gentleman!" "And I twice saw<br/>the pan change a card!" cried Kalganov. "How shameful! How<br/>shameful!" exclaimed Grushenka, clasping her hands, and blushing<br/>for genuine shame. "Good Lord, he's come to that!" "I thought so,<br/>too!" said Mitya. But before he had uttered the words, Vrublevsky,<br/>with a confused and infuriated face, shook his fist at Grushenka,<br/>shouting: "You low harlot!" Mitya flew at him at once, clutched him<br/>in both hands, lifted him in the air, and in one instant had<br/>carried him into the room on the right, from which they had just<br/>come. "I've laid him on the floor, there," he announced, returning<br/>at once, gasping with excitement. "He's struggling, the scoundrel!<br/>But he won't come back, no fear of that!… " He closed one half of<br/>the folding doors, and holding the other ajar called out to the<br/>little Pole: "Most illustrious, will you please to retire as well?"<br/>"My dear Dmitri Fyodorovitch," said Trifon Borissovitch, "make them<br/>give you back the money you lost. It's as good as stolen from you."<br/>"I don't want my fifty roubles back," Kalgonov declared suddenly.<br/>"I don't want my two hundred, either," cried Mitya, "I wouldn't<br/>take it for anything! Let him keep it as a consolation." "Bravo,<br/>Mitya! You're a trump, Mitya!" cried Grushenka, and there was a<br/>note of fierce anger in the exclamation. The little pan, crimson<br/>with fury but still mindful of his dignity, was making for the<br/>door, but he stopped short and said suddenly, addressing Grushenka:<br/>"Pani, if you want to come with me, come. If not, good-bye." And<br/>swelling with indignation and importance he went to the door. This<br/>was a man of character: he had so good an opinion of himself that<br/>after all that had passed, he still expected that she would marry<br/>him. Mitya slammed the door after him. "Lock it," said Kalganov.<br/>But the key clicked on the other side, they had locked it from<br/>within. "That's capital!" exclaimed Grushenka relentlessly. "Serve<br/>them right!"<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
