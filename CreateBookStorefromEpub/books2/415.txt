"And have you got any powder?" Nastya inquired.

"Yes."

"Show us the powder, too," she drawled with a smile of
entreaty.

Krassotkin dived again into his satchel and pulled out a small
flask containing a little real gunpowder. He had some shot, too, in
a screw of paper. He even uncorked the flask and shook a little
powder into the palm of his hand.

"One has to be careful there's no fire about, or it would blow
up and kill us all," Krassotkin warned them sensationally.

The children gazed at the powder with an awe-stricken alarm that
only intensified their enjoyment. But Kostya liked the shot
better.

"And does the shot burn?" he inquired.

"No, it doesn't."

"Give me a little shot," he asked in an imploring voice.

"I'll give you a little shot; here, take it, but don't show it
to your mother till I come back, or she'll be sure to think it's
gunpowder, and will die of fright and give you a thrashing."
