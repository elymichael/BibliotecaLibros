"Good-bye, Pyotr Ilyitch! My last tear is for you!… "

"He's not drunk, but he keeps babbling like a lunatic," Pyotr
Ilyitch thought as he watched him go. He had half a mind to stay
and see the cart packed with the remaining wines and provisions,
knowing that they would deceive and defraud Mitya. But, suddenly
feeling vexed with himself, he turned away with a curse and went to
the tavern to play billiards.

"He's a fool, though he's a good fellow," he muttered as he
went. "I've heard of that officer, Grushenka's former flame. Well,
if he has turned up… . Ech, those pistols! Damn it all! I'm not his
nurse! Let them do what they like! Besides, it'll all come to
nothing. They're a set of brawlers, that's all. They'll drink and
fight, fight and make friends again. They are not men who do
anything real. What does he mean by 'I'm stepping aside, I'm
punishing myself'? It'll come to nothing! He's shouted such phrases
a thousand times, drunk, in the taverns. But now he's not drunk.
'Drunk in spirit'- they're fond of fine phrases, the villains. Am I
his nurse? He must have been fighting, his face was all over blood.
With whom? I shall find out at the Metropolis. And his handkerchief
was soaked in blood… . It's still lying on my floor… . Hang
it!"

He reached the tavern in a bad humour and at once made up a
game. The game cheered him. He played a second game, and suddenly
began telling one of his partners that Dmitri Karamazov had come in
for some cash again- something like three thousand roubles, and had
gone to Mokroe again to spend it with Grushenka… . This news roused
singular interest in his listeners. They all spoke of it, not
laughing, but with a strange gravity. They left off playing.

"Three thousand? But where can he have got three thousand?"

Questions were asked. The story of Madame Hohlakov's present was
received with scepticism.

"Hasn't he robbed his old father?- that's the question."

"Three thousand! There's something odd about it."

"He boasted aloud that he would kill his father; we all heard
him, here. And it was three thousand he talked about… "

Pyotr Ilyitch listened. All at once he became short and dry in
his answers. He said not a word about the blood on Mitya's face and
hands, though he had meant to speak of it at first.
