<br/>The old man fairly fluttered with joy, as though nothing more<br/>comforting could have been said to him. In his delight he seized<br/>Alyosha's hand and pressed it warmly to his heart. Tears positively<br/>glittered in his eyes.<br/><br/>"That image of the Mother of God of which I was telling you just<br/>now," he said. "Take it home and keep it for yourself. And I'll let<br/>you go back to the monastery… . I was joking this morning, don't be<br/>angry with me. My head aches, Alyosha… . Alyosha, comfort my heart.<br/>Be an angel and tell me the truth!"<br/><br/>"You're still asking whether she has been here or not?" Alyosha<br/>said sorrowfully.<br/><br/>"No, no, no. I believe you. I'll tell you what it is: you go to<br/>Grushenka yourself, or see her somehow; make haste and ask her; see<br/>for yourself, which she means to choose, him or me. Eh? What? Can<br/>you?"<br/><br/>"If I see her I'll ask her," Alyosha muttered, embarrassed.<br/><br/>"No, she won't tell you," the old man interrupted, "she's a<br/>rogue. She'll begin kissing you and say that it's you she wants.<br/>She's a deceitful, shameless hussy. You mustn't go to her, you<br/>mustn't!"<br/><br/>"No father, and it wouldn't be suitable, it wouldn't be right at<br/>all."<br/><br/>"Where was he sending you just now? He shouted 'Go' as he ran<br/>away."<br/><br/>"For money? To ask her for money?"<br/><br/>"No. Not for money."<br/><br/>
