<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>4<br/>The Third Son, Alyosha<br/><br/><br/>HE was only twenty, his brother Ivan was in his twenty-fourth<br/>year at the time, while their elder brother Dmitri was<br/>twenty-seven. First of all, I must explain that this young man,<br/>Alyosha, was not a fanatic, and, in my opinion at least, was not<br/>even a mystic. I may as well give my full opinion from the<br/>beginning. He was simply an early lover of humanity, and that he<br/>adopted the monastic life was simply because at that time it struck<br/>him, so to say, as the ideal escape for his soul struggling from<br/>the darkness of worldly wickedness to the light of love. And the<br/>reason this life struck him in this way was that he found in it at<br/>that time, as he thought an extrordinary being, our celebrated<br/>elder, Zossima, to whom he became attached with all the warm first<br/>love of his ardent heart. But I do not dispute that he was very<br/>strange even at that time, and had been so indeed from his cradle.<br/>I have mentioned already, by the way, that though he lost his<br/>mother in his fourth year he remembered her all his life her face,<br/>her caresses, "as though she stood living before me." Such memories<br/>may persist, as everyone knows, from an even earlier age, even from<br/>two years old, but scarcely standing out through a whole lifetime<br/>like spots of light out of darkness, like a corner torn out of a<br/>huge picture, which has all faded and disappeared except that<br/>fragment. That is how it was with him. He remembered one still<br/>summer evening, an open window, the slanting rays of the setting<br/>sun (that he recalled most vividly of all); in a corner of the room<br/>the holy image, before it a lighted lamp, and on her knees before<br/>the image his mother, sobbing hysterically with cries and moans,<br/>snatching him up in both arms, squeezing him close till it hurt,<br/>and praying for him to the Mother of God, holding him out in both<br/>arms to the image as though to put him under the Mother's<br/>protectionâ€¦ and suddenly a nurse runs in and snatches him from her<br/>in terror. That was the picture! And Alyosha remembered his<br/>mother's face at that minute. He used to say that it was frenzied<br/>but beautiful as he remembered. But he rarely cared to speak of<br/>this memory to anyone. In his childhood and youth he was by no<br/>means expansive, and talked little indeed, but not from shyness or<br/>a sullen unsociability; quite the contrary, from something<br/>different, from a sort of inner preoccupation entirely personal and<br/>unconcerned with other people, but so important to him that he<br/>seemed, as it were, to forget others on account of it. But he was<br/>fond of people: he seemed throughout his life to put implicit trust<br/>in people: yet no one ever looked on him as a simpleton or naive<br/>person. There was something about him which made one feel at once<br/>(and it was so all his life afterwards) that he did not care to be<br/>a judge of others that he would never take it upon himself to<br/>criticise and would never condemn anyone for anything. He seemed,<br/>indeed, to accept everything without the least condemnation though<br/>often grieving bitterly: and this was so much so that no one could<br/>surprise or frighten him even in his earliest youth. Coming at<br/>twenty to his father's house, which was a very sink of filthy<br/>debauchery, he, chaste and pure as he was, simply withdrew in<br/>silence when to look on was unbearable, but without the slightest<br/>sign of contempt or condemnation. His father, who had once been in<br/>a dependent position, and so was sensitive and ready to take<br/>offence, met him at first with distrust and sullenness. "He does<br/>not say much," he used to say, "and thinks the more." But soon,<br/>within a fortnight indeed, he took to embracing him and kissing him<br/>terribly often, with drunken tears, with sottish sentimentality,<br/>yet he evidently felt a real and deep affection for him, such as he<br/>had never been capable of feeling for anyone before.<br/><br/>Everyone, indeed, loved this young man wherever he went, and it<br/>was so from his earliest childhood. When he entered the household<br/>of his patron and benefactor, Yefim Petrovitch Polenov, he gained<br/>the hearts of all the family, so that they looked on him quite as<br/>their own child. Yet he entered the house at such a tender age that<br/>he could not have acted from design nor artfulness in winning<br/>affection. So that the gift of making himself loved directly and<br/>unconsciously was inherent in him, in his very nature, so to speak.<br/>It was the same at school, though he seemed to be just one of those<br/>children who are distrusted, sometimes ridiculed, and even disliked<br/>by their schoolfellows. He was dreamy, for instance, and rather<br/>solitary. From his earliest childhood he was fond of creeping into<br/>a corner to read, and yet he was a general favourite all the while<br/>he was at school. He was rarely playful or merry, but anyone could<br/>see at the first glance that this was not from any sullenness. On<br/>the contrary he was bright and good-tempered. He never tried to<br/>show off among his schoolfellows. Perhaps because of this, he was<br/>never afraid of anyone, yet the boys immediately understood that he<br/>was not proud of his fearlessness and seemed to be unaware that he<br/>was bold and courageous. He never resented an insult. It would<br/>happen that an hour after the offence he would address the offender<br/>or answer some question with as trustful and candid an expression<br/>as though nothing had happened between them. And it was not that he<br/>seemed to have forgotten or intentionally forgiven the affront, but<br/>simply that he did not regard it as an affront, and this completely<br/>conquered and captivated the boys. He had one characteristic which<br/>made all his schoolfellows from the bottom class to the top want to<br/>mock at him, not from malice but because it amused them. This<br/>characteristic was a wild fanatical modesty and chastity. He could<br/>not bear to hear certain words and certain conversations about<br/>women. There are "certain" words and conversations unhappily<br/>impossible to eradicate in schools. Boys pure in mind and heart,<br/>almost children, are fond of talking in school among themselves,<br/>and even aloud, of things, pictures, and images of which even<br/>soldiers would sometimes hesitate to speak. More than that, much<br/>that soldiers have no knowledge or conception of is familiar to<br/>quite young children of our intellectual and higher classes. There<br/>is no moral depravity, no real corrupt inner cynicism in it, but<br/>there is the appearance of it, and it is often looked upon among<br/>them as something refined, subtle, daring, and worthy of imitation.<br/>Seeing that Alyosha Karamazov put his fingers in his ears when they<br/>talked of "that," they used sometimes to crowd round him, pull his<br/>hands away, and shout nastiness into both ears, while he struggled,<br/>slipped to the floor, tried to hide himself without uttering one<br/>word of abuse, enduring their insults in silence. But at last they<br/>left him alone and gave up taunting him with being a "regular<br/>girl," and what's more they looked upon it with compassion as a<br/>weakness. He was always one of the best in the class but was never<br/>first.<br/><br/>At the time of Yefim Petrovitch's death Alyosha had two more<br/>years to complete at the provincial gymnasium. The inconsolable<br/>widow went almost immediately after his death for a long visit to<br/>Italy with her whole family, which consisted only of women and<br/>girls. Alyosha went to live in the house of two distant relations<br/>of Yefim Petrovitch, ladies whom he had never seen before. On what<br/>terms she lived with them he did not know himself. It was very<br/>characteristic of him, indeed, that he never cared at whose expense<br/>he was living. In that respect he was a striking contrast to his<br/>elder brother Ivan, who struggled with poverty for his first two<br/>years in the university, maintained himself by his own efforts, and<br/>had from childhood been bitterly conscious of living at the expense<br/>of his benefactor. But this strange trait in Alyosha's character<br/>must not, I think, criticised too severely, for at the slightest<br/>acquaintance with him anyone would have perceived that Alyosha was<br/>one of those youths, almost of the type of religious enthusiast,<br/>who, if they were suddenly to come into possession of a large<br/>fortune, would not hesitate to give it away for the asking, either<br/>for good works or perhaps to a clever rogue. In general he seemed<br/>scarcely to know the value of money, not, of course, in a literal<br/>sense. When he was given pocket-money, which he never asked for, he<br/>was either terribly careless of it so that it was gone in a moment,<br/>or he kept it for weeks together, not knowing what to do with<br/>it.<br/><br/>In later years Pyotr Alexandrovitch Miusov, a man very sensitive<br/>on the score of money and bourgeois honesty, pronounced the<br/>following judgment, after getting to know Alyosha:<br/><br/>"Here is perhaps the one man in the world whom you might leave<br/>alone without a penny, in the centre of an unknown town of a<br/>million inhabitants, and he would not come to harm, he would not<br/>die of cold and hunger, for he would be fed and sheltered at once;<br/>and if he were not, he would find a shelter for himself, and it<br/>would cost him no effort or humiliation. And to shelter him would<br/>be no burden, but, on the contrary, would probably be looked on as<br/>a pleasure."<br/><br/>He did not finish his studies at the gymnasium. A year before<br/>the end of the course he suddenly announced to the ladies that he<br/>was going to see his father about a plan which had occurred to him.<br/>They were sorry and unwilling to let him go. The journey was not an<br/>expensive one, and the ladies would not let him pawn his watch, a<br/>parting present from his benefactor's family. They provided him<br/>liberally with money and even fitted him out with new clothes and<br/>linen. But he returned half the money they gave him, saying that he<br/>intended to go third class. On his arrival in the town he made no<br/>answer to his father's first inquiry why he had come before<br/>completing his studies, and seemed, so they say, unusually<br/>thoughtful. It soon became apparent that he was looking for his<br/>mother's tomb. He practically acknowledged at the time that that<br/>was the only object of his visit. But it can hardly have been the<br/>whole reason of it. It is more probable that he himself did not<br/>understand and could not explain what had suddenly arisen in his<br/>soul, and drawn him irresistibly into a new, unknown, but<br/>inevitable path. Fyodor Pavlovitch could not show him where his<br/>second wife was buried, for he had never visited her grave since he<br/>had thrown earth upon her coffin, and in the course of years had<br/>entirely forgotten where she was buried.<br/><br/>Fyodor Pavlovitch, by the way, had for some time previously not<br/>been living in our town. Three or four years after his wife's death<br/>he had gone to the south of Russia and finally turned up in Odessa,<br/>where he spent several years. He made the acquaintance at first, in<br/>his own words, "of a lot of low Jews, Jewesses, and Jewkins," and<br/>ended by being received by "Jews high and low alike." It may be<br/>presumed that at this period he developed a peculiar faculty for<br/>making and hoarding money. He finally returned to our town only<br/>three years before Alyosha's arrival. His former acquaintances<br/>found him looking terribly aged, although he was by no means an old<br/>man. He behaved not exactly with more dignity but with more<br/>effrontery. The former buffoon showed an insolent propensity for<br/>making buffoons of others. His depravity with women was not as it<br/>used to be, but even more revolting. In a short time he opened a<br/>great number of new taverns in the district. It was evident that he<br/>had perhaps a hundred thousand roubles or not much less. Many of<br/>the inhabitants of the town and district were soon in his debt,<br/>and, of course, had given good security. Of late, too, he looked<br/>somehow bloated and seemed more irresponsible, more uneven, had<br/>sunk into a sort of incoherence, used to begin one thing and go on<br/>with another, as though he were letting himself go altogether. He<br/>was more and more frequently drunk. And, if it had not been for the<br/>same servant Grigory, who by that time had aged considerably too,<br/>and used to look after him sometimes almost like a tutor, Fyodor<br/>Pavlovitch might have got into terrible scrapes. Alyosha's arrival<br/>seemed to affect even his moral side, as though something had<br/>awakened in this prematurely old man which had long been dead in<br/>his soul.<br/>
