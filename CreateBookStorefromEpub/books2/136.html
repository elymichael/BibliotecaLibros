Alyosha unbound his bitten finger. The handkerchief was soaked<br/>with blood. Madame Hohlakov screamed and shut her eyes.<br/><br/>"Good heavens, what a wound, how awful!<br/><br/>But as soon as Lise saw Alyosha's finger through the crack, she<br/>flung the door wide open.<br/><br/>"Come, come here," she cried, imperiously. "No nonsense now!<br/>Good heavens, why did you stand there saying nothing about it all<br/>this time? He might have bled to death, mamma! How did you do it?<br/>Water, water! You must wash it first of all, simply hold it in cold<br/>water to stop the pain, and keep it there, keep it thereâ€¦ . Make<br/>haste, mamma, some water in a slop-basin. But do make haste," she<br/>finished nervously. She was quite frightened at the sight of<br/>Alyosha's wound.<br/><br/>"Shouldn't we send for Herzenstube?" cried Madame Hohlakov.<br/><br/>"Mamma, you'll be the death of me. Your Herzenstube will come<br/>and say that he can make nothing of it! Water, water! Mamma, for<br/>goodness' sake go yourself and hurry Yulia, she is such a slowcoach<br/>and never can come quickly! Make haste, mamma, or I shall die."<br/><br/>"Why, it's nothing much," cried Alyosha, frightened at this<br/>alarm.<br/><br/>Yulia ran in with water and Alyosha put his finger in it.<br/><br/>"Some lint, mamma, for mercy's sake, bring some lint and that<br/>muddy caustic lotion for wounds, what's it called? We've got some.<br/>You know where the bottle is, mamma; it's in your bedroom in the<br/>right-hand cupboard, there's a big bottle of it there with the<br/>lint."<br/><br/>"I'll bring everything in a minute, Lise, only don't scream and<br/>don't fuss. You see how bravely Alexey Fyodorovitch bears it. Where<br/>did you get such a dreadful wound, Alexey Fyodorovitch?"<br/><br/>Madame Hohlakov hastened away. This was all Lise was waiting<br/>for.<br/>
