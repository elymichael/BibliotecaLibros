<br/>"I sincerely deplore his absence. Perhaps at our table he might<br/>have learnt to like us, and we him. Pray be seated, gentlemen."<br/><br/>He stood before the holy image, and began to say grace, aloud.<br/>All bent their heads reverently, and Maximov clasped his hands<br/>before him, with peculiar fervour.<br/><br/>It was at this moment that Fyodor Pavlovitch played his last<br/>prank. It must be noted that he really had meant to go home, and<br/>really had felt the impossibility of going to dine with the Father<br/>Superior as though nothing had happened, after his disgraceful<br/>behaviour in the elder's cell. Not that he was so very much ashamed<br/>of himself- quite the contrary perhaps. But still he felt it would<br/>be unseemly to go to dinner. Yet his creaking carriage had hardly<br/>been brought to the steps of the hotel, and he had hardly got into<br/>it, when he suddenly stopped short. He remembered his own words at<br/>the elder's: "I always feel when I meet people that I am lower than<br/>all, and that they all take me for a buffoon; so I say let me play<br/>the buffoon, for you are, every one of you, stupider and lower than<br/>I." He longed to revenge himself on everyone for his own<br/>unseemliness. He suddenly recalled how he had once in the past been<br/>asked, "Why do you hate so and so, so much?" And he had answered<br/>them, with his shameless impudence, "I'll tell you. He has done me<br/>no harm. But I played him a dirty trick, and ever since I have<br/>hated him."<br/><br/>Remembering that now, he smiled quietly and malignantly,<br/>hesitating for a moment. His eyes gleamed, and his lips positively<br/>quivered.<br/><br/>"Well, since I have begun, I may as well go on," he decided. His<br/>predominant sensation at that moment might be expressed in the<br/>following words, "Well, there is no rehabilitating myself now. So<br/>let me shame them for all I am worth. I will show them I don't care<br/>what they think- that's all!"<br/><br/>He told the coachman to wait, while with rapid steps he returned<br/>to the monastery and straight to the Father Superior's. He had no<br/>clear idea what he would do, but he knew that he could not control<br/>himself, and that a touch might drive him to the utmost limits of<br/>obscenity, but only to obscenity, to nothing criminal, nothing for<br/>which he could be legally punished. In the last resort, he could<br/>always restrain himself, and had marvelled indeed at himself, on<br/>that score, sometimes. He appeared in the Father Superior's<br/>dining-room, at the moment when the prayer was over, and all were<br/>moving to the table. Standing in the doorway, he scanned the<br/>company, and laughing his prolonged, impudent, malicious chuckle,<br/>looked them all boldly in the face. "They thought I had gone, and<br/>here I am again," he cried to the whole room.<br/><br/>For one moment everyone stared at him without a word; and at<br/>once everyone felt that something revolting, grotesque, positively<br/>scandalous, was about to happen. Miusov passed immediately from the<br/>most benevolent frame of mind to the most savage. All the feelings<br/>that had subsided and died down in his heart revived instantly.<br/><br/>"No! this I cannot endure!" he cried. "I absolutely cannot! andâ€¦<br/>I certainly cannot!"<br/><br/>The blood rushed to his head. He positively stammered; but he<br/>was beyond thinking of style, and he seized his hat.<br/><br/>"What is it he cannot?" cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, "that he<br/>absolutely cannot and certainly cannot? Your reverence, am I to<br/>come in or not? Will you receive me as your guest?"<br/><br/>
