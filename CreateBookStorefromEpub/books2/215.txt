"Good Lord!" I thought to myself, "he is thinking of other
people's respect at such a moment!" And I felt so sorry for him
then, that I believe I would have shared his fate if it could have
comforted him. I saw he was beside himself. I was aghast, realising
with my heart as well as my mind what such a resolution meant.

"Decide my fate!" he exclaimed again.

"Go and confess," I whispered to him. My voice failed me, but I
whispered it firmly. I took up the New Testament from the table,
the Russian translation, and showed him the Gospel of St. John,
chapter 12, verse 24:

"Verily, verily, I say unto you,

except a corn of wheat fall into

the ground and die, it abideth alone:

but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit."

I had just been reading that verse when he came in. He read
it.

"That's true," he said, he smiled bitterly. "It's terrible the
things you find in those books," he said, after a pause. "It's easy
enough to thrust them upon one. And who wrote them? Can they have
been written by men?"

"The Holy Spirit wrote them," said I.

"It's easy for you to prate," he smiled again, this time almost
with hatred.
