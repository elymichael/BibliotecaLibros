At this point the speech was interrupted by rather loud
applause. The last words, indeed, were pronounced with a note of
such sincerity that everyone felt that he really might have
something to say, and that what he was about to say would be of the
greatest consequence. But the President, hearing the applause, in a
loud voice threatened to clear the court if such an incident were
repeated. Every sound was hushed and Fetyukovitch began in a voice
full of feeling quite unlike the tone he had used hitherto.
