<br/>Mitya dropped his eyes and was a long time silent.<br/><br/>"My story, gentlemen? Well, was like this," he began softly.<br/>"Whether it was like this," he began softly. "Whether it was<br/>someone's tears, or my mother prayed to God, or a good angel kissed<br/>me at that instant, I don't know. But the devil was conquered. I<br/>rushed from the window and ran to the fence. My father was alarmed<br/>and, for the first time, he saw me then, cried out, and sprang back<br/>from the window. I remember that very well. I ran across the garden<br/>to the fenceâ€¦ and there Grigory caught me, when I was sitting on<br/>the fence."<br/><br/>At that point he raised his eyes at last and looked at his<br/>listeners. They seemed to be staring at him with perfectly<br/>unruffled attention. A sort of paroxysm of indignation seized on<br/>Mitya's soul.<br/><br/>"Why, you're laughing at me at this moment, gentlemen!" he broke<br/>off suddenly.<br/><br/>"What makes you think that?" observed Nikolay Parfenovitch.<br/><br/>"You don't believe one word- that's why! I understand, of<br/>course, that I have come to the vital point. The old man's lying<br/>there now with his skull broken, while I- after dramatically<br/>describing how I wanted to kill him, and how I snatched up the<br/>pestle- I suddenly run away from the window. A romance! Poetry! As<br/>though one could believe a fellow on his word. Ha ha! You are<br/>scoffers, gentlemen!"<br/><br/>And he swung round on his chair so that it creaked.<br/><br/>"And did you notice," asked the prosecutor suddenly, as though<br/>not observing Mitya's excitement, "did you notice when you ran away<br/>from the window, whether the door into the garden was open?"<br/><br/>"No, it was not open."<br/><br/>"It was not?"<br/><br/>
