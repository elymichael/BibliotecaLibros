"Where have you taken him away? Where have you taken him?" the<br/>lunatic cried in a heart-rending voice. Nina, too, broke into sobs.<br/>Kolya ran out of the room, the boys followed him. At last Alyosha<br/>too went out.<br/><br/>"Let them weep," he said to Kolya, "it's no use trying to<br/>comfort them just now. Let wait a minute and then go back."<br/><br/>"No, it's no use, it's awful," Kolya assented. "Do you know,<br/>Karamazov," he dropped his voice so that no one could hear them, "I<br/>feel dreadfully sad, and if it were only possible to bring him<br/>back, I'd give anything in the world to do it."<br/><br/>"Ah, so would I," said Alyosha.<br/><br/>"What do you think, Karamazov? Had we better come back here<br/>to-night? He'll be drunk, you know."<br/><br/>"Perhaps he will. Let us come together, you and I, that will be<br/>enough, to spend an hour with them, with the mother and Nina. If we<br/>all come together we shall remind them of everything again,"<br/>Alyosha suggested.<br/><br/>"The landlady is laying the table for them now- there'll be a<br/>funeral dinner or something, the priest is coming; shall we go back<br/>to it, Karamazov?"<br/><br/>"Of course," said Alyosha.<br/><br/>"It's all so strange, Karamazov, such sorrow and then pancakes<br/>after it, it all seems so unnatural in our religion."<br/><br/>"They are going to have salmon, too," the boy who had discovered<br/>about Troy observed in a loud voice.<br/><br/>"I beg you most earnestly, Kartashov, not to interrupt again<br/>with your idiotic remarks, especially when one is not talking to<br/>you and doesn't care to know whether you exist or not!" Kolya<br/>snapped out irritably. The boy flushed crimson but did not dare to<br/>reply.<br/>
