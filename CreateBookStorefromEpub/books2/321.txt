unable to make anything of Grushenka's words. "Come, why are we
sitting here? What shall we doâ€¦ to amuse ourselves again?"

"Ach, it's certainly anything but amusing!" Kalgonov mumbled
lazily.

"Let's play faro again, as we did just now," Maximov tittered
suddenly.

"Faro? Splendid!" cried Mitya. "If only the panovie-"

"It's lite, panovie," the Pole on the sofa responded, as it were
unwillingly.

"That's true," assented Pan Vrublevsky.

"Lite? What do you mean by 'lite'?" asked Grushenka.

"Late, pani! 'A late hour' I mean," the Pole on the sofa
explained.

"It's always late with them. They can never do anything!"
Grushenka almost shrieked in her anger. "They're dull themselves,
so they want others to be dull. Before came, Mitya, they were just
as silent and kept turning up their noses at me."

"My goddess!" cried the Pole on the sofa, "I see you're not
well-disposed to me, that's why I'm gloomy. I'm ready, panie,"
added he, addressing Mitya.
