"He means the three thousand," thought Mitya.<br/><br/>"But where are you? Are you at the door? I'll open it<br/>directly."<br/><br/>And the old man almost climbed out of the window, peering out to<br/>the right, where there was a door into the garden, trying to see<br/>into the darkness. In another second he would certainly have run<br/>out to open the door without waiting for Grushenka's answer.<br/><br/>Mitya looked at him from the side without stirring. The old<br/>man's profile that he loathed so, his pendent Adam's apple, his<br/>hooked nose, his lips that smiled in greedy expectation, were all<br/>brightly lighted up by the slanting lamplight falling on the left<br/>from the room. A horrible fury of hatred suddenly surged up in<br/>Mitya's heart: "There he was, his rival, the man who had tormented<br/>him, had ruined his life!" It was a rush of that sudden, furious,<br/>revengeful anger of which he had spoken, as though foreseeing it,<br/>to Alyosha, four days ago in the arbour, when, in answer to<br/>Alyosha's question, "How can you say you'll kill our father?" "I<br/>don't know, I don't know," he had said then. "Perhaps I shall not<br/>kill him, perhaps I shall. I'm afraid he'll suddenly be so<br/>loathsome to me at that moment. I hate his double chin, his nose,<br/>his eyes, his shameless grin. I feel a personal repulsion. That's<br/>what I'm afraid of, that's what may be too much for me."â€¦ This<br/>personal repulsion was growing unendurable. Mitya was beside<br/>himself, he suddenly pulled the brass pestle out of his pocket.<br/><br/>"God was watching over me then," Mitya himself said afterwards.<br/>At that very moment Grigory waked up on his bed of sickness.<br/>Earlier in the evening he had undergone the treatment which<br/>Smerdyakov had described to Ivan. He had rubbed himself all over<br/>with vodka mixed with a secret, very strong decoction, had drunk<br/>what was left of the mixture while his wife repeated a "certain<br/>prayer" over him, after which he had gone to bed. Marfa Ignatyevna<br/>had tasted the stuff, too, and, being unused to strong drink, slept<br/>like the dead beside her husband.<br/><br/>But Grigory waked up in the night, quite suddenly, and, after a<br/>moment's reflection, though he immediately felt a sharp pain in his<br/>back, he sat up in bed. Then he deliberated again, got up and<br/>dressed hurriedly. Perhaps his conscience was uneasy at the thought<br/>of sleeping while the house was unguarded "in such perilous times."<br/>Smerdyakov, exhausted by his fit, lay motionless in the next room.<br/>Marfa Ignatyevna did not stir. "The stuff's been too much for the<br/>woman," Grigory thought, glancing at her, and groaning, he went out<br/>on the steps. No doubt he only intended to look out from the steps,<br/>for he was hardly able to walk, the pain in his back and his right<br/>leg was intolerable. But he suddenly remembered that he had not<br/>locked the little gate into the garden that evening. He was the<br/>most punctual and precise of men, a man who adhered to an<br/>unchangeable routine, and habits that lasted for years. Limping and<br/>writhing with pain he went down the steps and towards the garden.<br/>Yes, the gate stood wide open. Mechanically he stepped into the<br/>garden. Perhaps he fancied something, perhaps caught some sound,<br/>and, glancing to the left he saw his master's window open. No one<br/>was looking out of it then.<br/><br/>"What's it open for? It's not summer now," thought Grigory, and<br/>suddenly, at that very instant he caught a glimpse of something<br/>extraordinary before him in the garden. Forty paces in front of him<br/>a man seemed to be running in the dark, a sort of shadow was moving<br/>very fast.<br/><br/>"Good Lord!" cried Grigory beside himself, and forgetting the<br/>pain in his back, he hurried to intercept the running figure. He<br/>took a short cut, evidently he knew the garden better; the flying<br/>figure went towards the bath-house, ran behind it and rushed to the<br/>garden fence. Grigory followed, not losing sight of him, and ran,<br/>forgetting everything. He reached the fence at the very moment the<br/>man was climbing over it. Grigory cried out, beside himself,<br/>pounced on him, and clutched his leg in his two hands.<br/><br/>Yes, his foreboding had not deceived him. He recognised him; it<br/>was he, the "monster," the "parricide."<br/><br/>"Parricide! the old man shouted so that the whole neighbourhood<br/>could hear, but he had not time to shout more, he fell at once, as<br/>though struck by lightning.<br/><br/>Mitya jumped back into the garden and bent over the fallen man.<br/>In Mitya's hands was a brass pestle, and he flung it mechanically<br/>in the grass. The pestle fell two paces from Grigory, not in the<br/>grass but on the path, in a most conspicuous place. For some<br/>seconds he examined the prostrate figure before him. The old man's<br/>head was covered with blood. Mitya put out his hand and began<br/>feeling it. He remembered afterwards clearly that he had been<br/>awfully anxious to make sure whether he had broken the old man's<br/>skull, or simply stunned him with the pestle. But the blood was<br/>flowing horribly; and in a moment Mitya's fingers were drenched<br/>with the hot stream. He remembered taking out of his pocket the<br/>clean white handkerchief with which he had provided himself for his<br/>visit to Madame Hohlakov, and putting it to the old man's head,<br/>senselessly trying to wipe the blood from his face and temples. But<br/>the handkerchief was instantly soaked with blood.<br/>
