"And do you know, Alexey Fyodorovitch, how people do go out of
their minds?" Ivan asked in a a voice suddenly quiet, without a
trace of irritation, with a note of the simplest curiosity.

"No, I don't. I suppose there are all kinds of insanity."

"And can one observe that one's going mad oneself?"

"I imagine one can't see oneself clearly in such circumstances,"
Alyosha answered with surprise.

Ivan paused for half a minute.

"If you want to talk to me, please change the subject," he said
suddenly.

"Oh, while I think of it, I have a letter for you," said Alyosha
timidly, and he took Lise's note from his pocket and held it out to
Ivan. They were just under a lamp-post. Ivan recognised the
handwriting at once.

without opening the envelope, he tore it into bits and threw it in
the air. The bits were scattered by the wind.

"She's not sixteen yet, I believe, and already offering
herself," he said contemptuously, striding along the street
again.
