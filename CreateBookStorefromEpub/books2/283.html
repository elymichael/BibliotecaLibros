<br/>Mitya stood for a moment, then mechanically sank on to a chair<br/>next to Fenya. He sat, not reflecting but, as it were,<br/>terror-stricken, benumbed. Yet everything was clear as day: that<br/>officer, he knew about him, he knew everything perfectly, he had<br/>known it from Grushenka herself, had known that a letter had come<br/>from him a month before. So that for a month, for a whole month,<br/>this had been going on, a secret from him, till the very arrival of<br/>this new man, and he had never thought of him! But how could he,<br/>how could he not have thought of him? Why was it he had forgotten<br/>this officer, like that, forgotten him as soon as he heard of him?<br/>That was the question that faced him like some monstrous thing. And<br/>he looked at this monstrous thing with horror, growing cold with<br/>horror.<br/><br/>But suddenly, as gently and mildly as a gentle and affectionate<br/>child, he began speaking to Fenya as though he had utterly<br/>forgotten how he had scared and hurt her just now. He fell to<br/>questioning Fenya with an extreme preciseness, astonishing in his<br/>position, and though the girl looked wildly at his blood-stained<br/>hands, she, too, with wonderful readiness and rapidity, answered<br/>every question as though eager to put the whole truth and nothing<br/>but the truth before him. Little by little, even with a sort of<br/>enjoyment, she began explaining every detail, not wanting to<br/>torment him, but, as it were, eager to be of the utmost service to<br/>him. She described the whole of that day, in great detail, the<br/>visit of Rakitin and Alyosha, how she, Fenya, had stood on the<br/>watch, how the mistress had set off, and how she had called out of<br/>the window to Alyosha to give him, Mitya, her greetings, and to<br/>tell him "to remember for ever how she had loved him for an<br/>hour."<br/><br/>Hearing of the message, Mitya suddenly smiled, and there was a<br/>flush of colour on his pale cheeks. At the same moment Fenya said<br/>to him, not a bit afraid now to be inquisitive:<br/><br/>"Look at your hands, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. They're all over<br/>blood!<br/><br/>"Yes," answered Mitya mechanically. He looked carelessly at his<br/>hands and at once forgot them and Fenya's question.<br/><br/>He sank into silence again. Twenty minutes had passed since he<br/>had run in. His first horror was over, but evidently some new fixed<br/>determination had taken possession of him. He suddenly stood up,<br/>smiling dreamily.<br/><br/>"What has happened to you, sir?" said Fenya, pointing to his<br/>hands again. She spoke compassionately, as though she felt very<br/>near to him now in his grief. Mitya looked at his hands again.<br/><br/>"That's blood, Fenya," he said, looking at her with a strange<br/>expression. "That's human blood, and my God! why was it shed? But…<br/>Fenya… there's a fence here" (he looked at her as though setting<br/>her a riddle), "a high fence, and terrible to look at. But at dawn<br/>to-morrow, when the sun rises, Mitya will leap over that fence… .<br/>You don't understand what fence, Fenya, and, never mind… . You'll<br/>hear to-morrow and understand… and now, good-bye. I won't stand in<br/>her way. I'll step aside, I know how to step aside. Live, my joy… .<br/>You loved me for an hour, remember Mityenka Karamazov so for ever…<br/>. She always used to call me Mityenka, do you remember?"<br/><br/>And with those words he went suddenly out of the kitchen. Fenya<br/>was almost more frightened at this sudden departure than she had<br/>been when he ran in and attacked her.<br/><br/>Just ten minutes later Dmitri went in to Pyotr Ilyitch Perhotin,<br/>the young official with whom he had pawned his pistols. It was by<br/>now half-past eight, and Pyotr Ilyitch had finished his evening<br/>tea, and had just put his coat on again to go to the Metropolis to<br/>play billiards. Mitya caught him coming out.<br/><br/>
