"What's wrong with him?" asked Alyosha, "Is he a tell-tale or<br/>what?"<br/><br/>The boys looked at one another as though derisively.<br/><br/>"Are you going that way, to Mihailovsky?" the same boy went on.<br/>"Catch him upâ€¦ . You see he's stopped again, he is waiting and<br/>looking at you."<br/><br/>"He is looking at you," the other boys chimed in.<br/><br/>"You ask him, does he like a dishevelled wisp of tow. Do you<br/>hear, ask him that!"<br/><br/>There was a general burst of laughter. Alyosha looked at them,<br/>and they at him.<br/><br/>"Don't go near him, he'll hurt you," cried Smurov in a warning<br/>voice.<br/><br/>"I shan't ask him about the wisp of tow, for I expect you tease<br/>him with that question somehow. But I'll find out from him why you<br/>hate him so."<br/><br/>"Find out then, find out," cried the boys laughing.<br/><br/>Alyosha crossed the bridge and walked uphill by the fence,<br/>straight towards the boy.<br/><br/>"You'd better look out," the boys called after him; "he won't be<br/>afraid of you. He will stab you in a minute, on the sly, as he did<br/>Krassotkin."<br/>
