<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>2<br/>Lyagavy<br/><br/><br/>SO he must drive at full speed, and he had not the money for<br/>horses. He had forty copecks, and that was all, all that was left<br/>after so many years of prosperity! But he had at home an old silver<br/>watch which had long ceased to go. He snatched it up and carried it<br/>to a Jewish watch maker who had a shop in the market-place. The Jew<br/>gave him six roubles for it.<br/><br/>"And I didn't expect that cried Mitya, ecstatically. (He was<br/>still in a state of ecstasy.) He seized his six roubles and ran<br/>home. At home he borrowed three roubles from the people of the<br/>house, who loved him so much that they were pleased to give it him,<br/>though it was all they had. Mitya in his excitement told them on<br/>the spot that his fate would be decided that day, and he described,<br/>in desperate haste, the whole scheme he had put before Samsonov,<br/>the latter's decision, his own hopes for the future, and so on.<br/>These people had been told many of their lodger's secrets before,<br/>and so looked upon him as a gentleman who was not at all proud, and<br/>almost one of themselves. Having thus collected nine roubles Mitya<br/>sent for posting-horses to take him to the Volovya station. This<br/>was how the fact came to be remembered and established that "at<br/>midday, on the day before the event, Mitya had not a farthing, and<br/>that he had sold his watch to get money and had borrowed three<br/>roubles from his landlord, all in the presence of witnesses."<br/><br/>I note this fact, later on it will be apparent why I do so.<br/><br/>Though he was radiant with the joyful anticipation that he would<br/>at last solve all his difficulties, yet, as he drew near Volovya<br/>station, he trembled at the thought of what Grushenka might be<br/>doing in his absence. What if she made up her mind to-day to go to<br/>Fyodor Pavlovitch? This was why he had gone off without telling her<br/>and why he left orders with his landlady not to let out where he<br/>had gone, if anyone came to inquire for him.<br/><br/>"I must, I must get back to-night," he repeated, as he was<br/>jolted along in the cart, "and I dare say I shall have to bring<br/>this Lyagavy back hereâ€¦ to draw up the deed." So mused Mitya, with<br/>a throbbing heart, but alas! his dreams were not fated to be<br/>carried out.<br/><br/>To begin with, he was late, taking a short cut from Volovya<br/>station which turned out to be eighteen versts instead of twelve.<br/>Secondly, he did not find the priest at home at Ilyinskoe; he had<br/>gone off to a neighbouring village. While Mitya, setting off there<br/>with the same exhausted horses, was looking for him, it was almost<br/>dark.<br/><br/>The priest, a shy and amiable looking little man, informed him<br/>at once that though Lyagavy had been staying with him at first, he<br/>was now at Suhoy Possyolok, that he was staying the night in the<br/>forester's cottage, as he was buying timber there too. At Mitya's<br/>urgent request that he would take him to Lyagavy at once, and by so<br/>doing "save him, so to speak," the priest agreed, after some demur,<br/>to conduct him to Suhoy Possyolok; his curiosity was obviously<br/>aroused. But, unluckily, he advised their going on foot, as it<br/>would not be "much over" a verst. Mitya, of course, agreed, and<br/>marched off with his yard-long strides, so that the poor priest<br/>almost ran after him. He was a very cautious man, though not<br/>old.<br/>
