"I saw three thousand as clear as a penny in his hands, I saw it<br/>with my own eyes; I should think I ought to know how to reckon<br/>money," cried Trifon Borissovitch, doing his best to satisfy "his<br/>betters."<br/><br/>When Fetyukovitch had to cross-examine him, he scarcely tried to<br/>refute his evidence, but began asking him about an incident at the<br/>first carousal at Mokroe, a month before the arrest, when Timofey<br/>and another peasant called Akim had picked up on the floor in the<br/>passage a hundred roubles dropped by Mitya when he was drunk, and<br/>had given them to Trifon Borissovitch and received a rouble each<br/>from him for doing so. "Well," asked the lawyer," did you give that<br/>hundred roubles back to Mr. Karamazov?" Trifon Borissovitch<br/>shuffled in vainâ€¦ . He was obliged, after the peasants had been<br/>examined, to admit the finding of the hundred roubles, only adding<br/>that he had religiously returned it all to Dmitri Fyodorovitch "in<br/>perfect honesty, and it's only because his honour was in liquor at<br/>the time, he wouldn't remember it." But, as he had denied the<br/>incident of the hundred roubles till the peasants had been called<br/>to prove it, his evidence as to returning the money to Mitya was<br/>naturally regarded with great suspicion. So one of the most<br/>dangerous witnesses brought forward by the prosecution was again<br/>discredited.<br/><br/>The same thing happened with the Poles. They took up an attitude<br/>of pride and independence; they vociferated loudly that they had<br/>both been in the service of the Crown, and that "Pan Mitya" had<br/>offered them three thousand "to buy their honour," and that they<br/>had seen a large sum of money in his hands. Pan Mussyalovitch<br/>introduced a terrible number of Polish words into his sentences,<br/>and seeing that this only increased his consequence in the eyes of<br/>the President and the prosecutor, grew more and more pompous, and<br/>ended by talking in Polish altogether. But Fetyukovitch caught<br/>them, too, in his snares. Trifon Borissovitch, recalled, was<br/>forced, in spite of his evasions, to admit that Pan Vrublevsky had<br/>substituted another pack of cards for the one he had provided, and<br/>that Pan Mussyalovitch had cheated during the game. Kalgonov<br/>confirmed this, and both the Poles left the witness-box with<br/>damaged reputations, amidst laughter from the public.<br/><br/>Then exactly the same thing happened with almost all the most<br/>dangerous witnesses. Fetyukovitch succeeded in casting a slur on<br/>all of them, and dismissing them with a certain derision. The<br/>lawyers and experts were lost in admiration, and were only at a<br/>loss to understand what good purpose could be served by it, for<br/>all, I repeat, felt that the case for the prosecution could not be<br/>refuted, but was growing more and more tragically overwhelming. But<br/>from the confidence of the "great magician" they saw that he was<br/>serene, and they waited, feeling that "such a man" had not come<br/>from Petersburg for nothing, and that he was not a man to return<br/>unsuccessful.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
