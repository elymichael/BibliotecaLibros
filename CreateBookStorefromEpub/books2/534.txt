And, of course, this brief episode did him no good with the jury
or the public. His character was displayed, and it spoke for
itself. It was under the influence of this incident that the
opening statement was read. It was rather short, but
circumstantial. It only stated the chief reasons why he had been
arrested, why he must be tried, and so on. Yet it made a great
impression on me. The clerk read it loudly and distinctly. The
whole tragedy was suddenly unfolded before us, concentrated, in
bold relief, in a fatal and pitiless light. I remember how,
immediately after it had been read, the President asked Mitya in a
loud impressive voice:

"Prisoner, do you plead guilty?"

Mitya suddenly rose from his seat.

"I plead guilty to drunkenness and dissipation," he exclaimed,
again in a startling, almost frenzied, voice, "to idleness and
debauchery. I meant to become an honest man for good, just at the
moment when I was struck down by fate. But I am not guilty of the
death of that old man, my enemy and my father. No, no, I am not
guilty of robbing him! I could not be. Dmitri Karamazov is a
scoundrel, but not a thief."

He sat down again, visibly trembling all over. The President
again briefly, but impressively, admonished him to answer only what
was asked, and not to go off into irrelevant exclamations. Then he
ordered the case to proceed. All the witnesses were led up to take
the oath. Then I saw them all together. The brothers of the
prisoner were, however, allowed to give evidence without taking the
oath. After an exhortation from the priest and the President, the
witnesses were led away and were made to sit as far as possible
apart from one another. Then they began calling them up one by
one.
