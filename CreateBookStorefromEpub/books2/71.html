<br/>"And you were going the backway! Oh, gods, I thank you for<br/>sending him by the backway, and he came to me like the golden fish<br/>to the silly old fishermen in the fable! Listen, Alyosha, listen,<br/>brother! Now I mean to tell you everything, for I must tell<br/>someone. An angel in heaven I've told already; but I want to tell<br/>an angel on earth. You are an angel on earth. You will hear and<br/>judge and forgive. And that's what I need, that someone above me<br/>should forgive. Listen! If two people break away from everything on<br/>earth and fly off into the unknown, or at least one of them, and<br/>before flying off or going to ruin he comes to someone else and<br/>says, 'Do this for me'- some favour never asked before that could<br/>only be asked on one's deathbed- would that other refuse, if he<br/>were a friend or a brother?"<br/><br/>"I will do it, but tell me what it is, and make haste," said<br/>Alyosha.<br/><br/>"Make haste! H'm!â€¦ Don't be in a hurry, Alyosha, you hurry and<br/>worry yourself. There's no need to hurry now. Now the world has<br/>taken a new turning. Ah, Alyosha, what a pity you can't understand<br/>ecstasy. But what am I saying to him? As though you didn't<br/>understand it. What an ass I am! What am I saying? 'Be noble, O<br/>man!'- who says that?"<br/><br/>Alyosha made up his mind to wait. He felt that, perhaps, indeed,<br/>his work lay here. Mitya sank into thought for a moment, with his<br/>elbow on the table and his head in his hand. Both were silent.<br/><br/>"Alyosha," said Mitya, "you're the only one who won't laugh. I<br/>should like to begin- my confession- with Schiller's Hymn to Joy,<br/>An die Freude! I don't know German, I only know it's called that.<br/>Don't think I'm talking nonsense because I'm drunk. I'm not a bit<br/>drunk. Brandy's all very well, but I need two bottles to make me<br/>drunk:<br/><br/>{verse<br/><br/>Silenus with his rosy phiz<br/><br/>Upon his stumbling ass.<br/><br/>{verse<br/><br/>But I've not drunk a quarter of a bottle, and I'm not Silenus.<br/>I'm not Silenus, though I am strong,<br/>[3]<br/>
