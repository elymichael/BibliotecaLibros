"Alive? He's alive?" cried Mitya, flinging up his hands. His<br/>face beamed. "Lord, I thank Thee for the miracle Thou has wrought<br/>for me, a sinner and evildoer. That's an answer to my prayer. I've<br/>been praying all night." And he crossed himself three times. He was<br/>almost breathless.<br/><br/>"So from this Grigory we have received such important evidence<br/>concerning you, that-" The prosecutor would have continued, but<br/>Mitya suddenly jumped up from his chair.<br/><br/>"One minute, gentlemen, for God's sake, one minute; I will run<br/>to her-"<br/><br/>"Excuse me, at this moment it's quite impossible," Nikolay<br/>Parfenovitch almost shrieked. He, too, leapt to his feet. Mitya was<br/>seized by the men with the metal plates, but he sat down of his own<br/>accord… .<br/><br/>"Gentlemen, what a pity! I wanted to see her for one minute<br/>only; I wanted to tell her that it has been washed away, it has<br/>gone, that blood that was weighing on my heart all night, and that<br/>I am not a murderer now! Gentlemen, she is my betrothed!" he said<br/>ecstatically and reverently, looking round at them all. "Oh, thank<br/>you, gentlemen! Oh, in one minute you have given me new life, new<br/>heart!… That old man used to carry me in his arms, gentlemen. He<br/>used to wash me in the tub when I was a baby three years old,<br/>abandoned by everyone, he was like a father to me!… "<br/><br/>"And so you-" the investigating lawyer began.<br/><br/>"Allow me, gentlemen, allow me one minute more," interposed<br/>Mitya, putting his elbows on the table and covering his face with<br/>his hands. "Let me have a moment to think, let me breathe,<br/>gentlemen. All this is horribly upsetting, horribly. A man is not a<br/>drum, gentlemen!"<br/><br/>"Drink a little more water," murmured Nikolay Parfenovitch.<br/>Mitya took his hands from his face and laughed. His eyes were<br/>confident. He seemed completely transformed in a moment. His whole<br/>bearing was changed; he was once more the equal of these men, with<br/>all of whom he was acquainted, as though they had all met the day<br/>before, when nothing had happened, at some social gathering. We may<br/>note in passing that, on his first arrival, Mitya had been made<br/>very welcome at the police captain's, but later, during the last<br/>month especially, Mitya had hardly called at all, and when the<br/>police captain met him, in the street, for instance, Mitya noticed<br/>that he frowned and only bowed out of politeness. His acquaintance<br/>with the prosecutor was less intimate, though he sometimes paid his<br/>wife, a nervous and fanciful lady, visits of politeness, without<br/>quite knowing why, and she always received him graciously and had,<br/>for some reason, taken an interest in him up to the last. He had<br/>not had time to get to know the investigating lawyer, though he had<br/>met him and talked to him twice, each time about the fair sex.<br/><br/>"You're a most skilful lawyer, I see, Nikolay Parfenovitch,"<br/>cried Mitya, laughing gaily, "but I can help you now. Oh,<br/>gentlemen, I feel like a new man, and don't be offended at my<br/>addressing you so simply and directly. I'm rather drunk, too, I'll<br/>tell you that frankly. I believe I've had the honour and pleasure<br/>of meeting you, Nikolay Parfenovitch, at my kinsman Miusov's.<br/>Gentlemen, gentlemen, I don't pretend to be on equal terms with<br/>you. I understand, of course, in what character I am sitting before<br/>you. Oh, of course, there's a horrible suspicion… hanging over me…<br/>if Grigory has given evidence… . A horrible suspicion! It's awful,<br/>awful, I understand that! But to business, gentlemen, I am ready,<br/>and we will make an end of it in one moment; for, listen, listen,<br/>gentlemen! Since I know I'm innocent, we can put an end to it in a<br/>minute. Can't we? Can't we?"<br/><br/>Mitya spoke much and quickly, nervously and effusively, as<br/>though he positively took his listeners to be his best friends.<br/><br/>"So, for the present, we will write that you absolutely deny the<br/>charge brought against you," said Nikolay Parfenovitch,<br/>impressively, and bending down to the secretary he dictated to him<br/>in an undertone what to write.<br/>
