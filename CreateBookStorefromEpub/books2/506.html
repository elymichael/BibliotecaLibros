<br/>"In the ordinary occasions of life," he said in the same<br/>complacent and sententious tone in which he had taunted Grigory and<br/>argued with him about religion at Fyodor Pavlovitch's table, "in<br/>the ordinary occasions of life, blows on the face are forbidden<br/>nowadays by law, and people have given them up, but in exceptional<br/>occasions of life people still fly to blows, not only among us but<br/>all over the world, be it even the fullest republic of France, just<br/>as in the time of Adam and Eve, and they never will leave off, but<br/>you, even in an exceptional case, did not dare."<br/><br/>"What are you learning French words for?" Ivan nodded towards<br/>the exercise-book lying on the table.<br/><br/>"Why shouldn't I learn them so as to improve my education,<br/>supposing that I may myself chance to go some day to those happy<br/>parts of Europe?"<br/><br/>"Listen, monster." Ivan's eyes flashed and he trembled all over.<br/>"I am not afraid of your accusations; you can say what you like<br/>about me, and if I don't beat you to death, it's simply because I<br/>suspect you of that crime and I'll drag you to justice. I'll unmask<br/>you."<br/><br/>"To my thinking, you'd better keep quiet, for what can you<br/>accuse me of, considering my absolute innocence? And who would<br/>believe you? Only if you begin, I shall tell everything, too, for I<br/>must defend myself."<br/><br/>"Do you think I am afraid of you now?"<br/><br/>"If the court doesn't believe all I've said to you just now, the<br/>public will, and you will be ashamed."<br/><br/>"That's as much as to say, 'It's always worth while speaking to<br/>a sensible man,' eh?" snarled Ivan.<br/><br/>"You hit the mark, indeed. And you'd better be sensible."<br/><br/>Ivan got up, shaking all over with indignation, put on his coat,<br/>and without replying further to Smerdyakov, without even looking at<br/>him, walked quickly out of the cottage. The cool evening air<br/>refreshed him. There was a bright moon in the sky. A nightmare of<br/>ideas and sensations filled his soul. "Shall I go at once and give<br/>information against Smerdyakov? But what information can I give? He<br/>is not guilty, anyway. On the contrary, he'll accuse me. And in<br/>fact, why did I set off for Tchermashnya then? What for? What for?"<br/>Ivan asked himself. "Yes, of course, I was expecting something and<br/>he is rightâ€¦ " And he remembered for the hundredth time how, on the<br/>last night in his father's house, he had listened on the stairs.<br/>But he remembered it now with such anguish that he stood still on<br/>the spot as though he had been stabbed. "Yes, I expected it then,<br/>that's true! I wanted the murder, I did want the murder! Did I want<br/>the murder? Did I want it? I must kill Smerdyakov! If I don't dare<br/>kill Smerdyakov now, life is not worth living!"<br/><br/>
