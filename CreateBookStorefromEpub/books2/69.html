<br/>Alyosha was delighted too, but he did not know how to get over<br/>the hurdle. Mitya put his powerful hand under his elbow to help him<br/>jump. Tucking up his cassock, Alyosha leapt over the hurdle with<br/>the agility of a bare-legged street urchin.<br/><br/>"Well done! Now come along," said Mitya in an enthusiastic<br/>whisper.<br/><br/>"Where?" whispered Alyosha, looking about him and finding<br/>himself in a deserted garden with no one near but themselves. The<br/>garden was small, but the house was at least fifty paces away.<br/><br/>"There's no one here. Why do you whisper?" asked Alyosha.<br/><br/>"Why do I whisper? Deuce take it" cried Dmitri at the top of his<br/>voice. "You see what silly tricks nature plays one. I am here in<br/>secret, and on the watch. I'll explain later on, but, knowing it's<br/>a secret, I began whispering like a fool, when there's no need. Let<br/>us go. Over there. Till then be quiet. I want to kiss you.<br/><br/>Glory to God in the world,<br/><br/>Glory to God in meâ€¦ I was just repeating that, sitting here,<br/>before you came."<br/><br/>The garden was about three acres in extent, and planted with<br/>trees only along the fence at the four sides. There were<br/>apple-trees, maples, limes and birch-trees. The middle of the<br/>garden was an empty grass space, from which several hundredweight<br/>of hay was carried in the summer. The garden was let out for a few<br/>roubles for the summer. There were also plantations of raspberries<br/>and currants and gooseberries laid out along the sides; a kitchen<br/>garden had been planted lately near the house.<br/><br/>Dmitri led his brother to the most secluded corner of the<br/>garden. There, in a thicket of lime-trees and old bushes of black<br/>currant, elder, snowball-tree, and lilac, there stood a tumbledown<br/>green summer-house; blackened with age. Its walls were of<br/>lattice-work, but there was still a roof which could give shelter.<br/>God knows when this summer-house was built. There was a tradition<br/>that it had been put up some fifty years before by a retired<br/>colonel called von Schmidt, who owned the house at that time. It<br/>was all in decay, the floor was rotting, the planks were loose, the<br/>woodwork smelled musty. In the summer-house there was a green<br/>wooden table fixed in the ground, and round it were some green<br/>benches upon which it was still possible to sit. Alyosha had at<br/>once observed his brother's exhilarated condition, and on entering<br/>the arbour he saw half a bottle of brandy and a wineglass on the<br/>table.<br/><br/>"That's brandy," Mitya laughed. "I see your look: 'He's drinking<br/>again" Distrust the apparition.<br/><br/>
