Meantime she had made Pyotr Ilyitch sit down and sat down
herself, facing him briefly, but fairly clearly, Pyotr Ilyitch told
her the history of the affair, that part of it at least which he
had himself witnessed. He described, too, his visit to Fenya, and
told her about the pestle. All these details produced an
overwhelming effect on the distracted lady, who kept uttering
shrieks, and covering her face with her hands…

"Would you believe it, I foresaw all this! I have that special
faculty, whatever I imagine comes to pass. And how often I've
looked at that awful man and always thought, that man will end by
murdering me. And now it's happened… that is, if he hasn't murdered
me, but only his own father, it's only because the finger of God
preserved me, and what's more, he was ashamed to murder me because,
in this very place, I put the holy ikon from the relics of the holy
martyr, Saint Varvara, on his neck… . And to think how near I was
to death at that minute I went close up to him and he stretched out
his neck to me!… Do you know, Pyotr Ilyitch (I think you said your
name was Pyotr Ilyitch), I don't believe in miracles, but that ikon
and this unmistakable miracle with me now- that shakes me, and I'm
ready to believe in anything you like. Have you heard about Father
Zossima?… But I don't know what I'm saying… and only fancy, with
the ikon on his neck he spat at me… . He only spat, it's true, he
didn't murder me and… he dashed away! But what shall we do, what
must we do now? What do you think?"

Pyotr Ilyitch got up, and announced that he was going straight
to the police captain, to tell him all about it, and leave him to
do what he thought fit.

"Oh, he's an excellent man, excellent! Mihail Makarovitch, I
know him. Of course, he's the person to go to. How practical you
are, Pyotr Ilyitch! How well you've thought of everything! I should
never have thought of it in your place!"

"Especially as I know the police captain very well, too,"
observed Pyotr Ilyitch, who still continued to stand, and was
obviously anxious to escape as quickly as possible from the
impulsive lady, who would not let him say good-bye and go away.

"And be sure, be sure," she prattled on, "to come back and tell
me what you see there, and what you find out… what comes to light…
how they'll try him… and what he's condemned to… . Tell me, we have
no capital punishment, have we? But be sure to come, even if it's
at three o'clock at night, at four, at half-past four… . Tell them
to wake me, to wake me, to shake me, if I don't get up… . But, good
heavens, I shan't sleep! But wait, hadn't I better come with
you?"

"N-no. But if you would write three lines with your own hand,
stating that you did not give Dmitri Fyodorovitch money, it might,
perhaps, be of use… in case it's needed… "

"To be sure!" Madame Hohlakov skipped, delighted, to her bureau.
"And you know I'm simply struck, amazed at your resourcefulness,
your good sense in such affairs. Are you in the service here? I'm
delighted to think that you're in the service here!"

And still speaking, she scribbled on half a sheet of notepaper
the following lines:

I've never in my life lent to that unhappy man, Dmitri
Fyodorovitch Karamazov (for, in spite of all, he is unhappy), three
thousand roubles to-day. I've never given him money, never: That I
swear by all thats holy! K. Hohlakov
