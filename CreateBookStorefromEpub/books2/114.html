<br/>He went round the monastery, and crossed the pine-wood to the<br/>hermitage. The door was opened to him, though no one was admitted<br/>at that hour. There was a tremor in his heart as he went into<br/>Father Zossima's cell.<br/><br/>"Why, why, had he gone forth? Why had he sent him into the<br/>world? Here was peace. Here was holiness. But there was confusion,<br/>there was darkness in which one lost one's way and went astray at<br/>once… ."<br/><br/>In the cell he found the novice Porfiry and Father Paissy, who<br/>came every hour to inquire after Father Zossima. Alyosha learnt<br/>with alarm that he was getting worse and worse. Even his usual<br/>discourse with the brothers could not take place that day. As a<br/>rule every evening after service the monks flocked into Father<br/>Zossima's cell, and all confessed aloud their sins of the day,<br/>their sinful thoughts and temptations; even their disputes, if<br/>there had been any. Some confessed kneeling. The elder absolved,<br/>reconciled, exhorted, imposed penance, blessed, and dismissed them.<br/>It was against this general "confession" that the opponents of<br/>"elders" protested, maintaining that it was a profanation of the<br/>sacrament of confession, almost a sacrilege, though this was quite<br/>a different thing. They even represented to the diocesan<br/>authorities that such confessions attained no good object, but<br/>actually to a large extent led to sin and temptation. Many of the<br/>brothers disliked going to the elder, and went against their own<br/>will because everyone went, and for fear they should be accused of<br/>pride and rebellious ideas. People said that some of the monks<br/>agreed beforehand, saying, "I'll confess I lost my temper with you<br/>this morning, and you confirm it," simply in order to have<br/>something to say. Alyosha knew that this actually happened<br/>sometimes. He knew, too, that there were among the monks some who<br/>deep resented the fact that letters from relations were habitually<br/>taken to the elder, to be opened and read by him before those to<br/>whom they were addressed.<br/><br/>It was assumed, of course, that all this was done freely, and in<br/>good faith, by way of voluntary submission and salutary guidance.<br/>But, in fact, there was sometimes no little insincerity, and much<br/>that was false and strained in this practice. Yet the older and<br/>more experienced of the monks adhered to their opinion, arguing<br/>that "for those who have come within these walls sincerely seeking<br/>salvation, such obedience and sacrifice will certainly be salutary<br/>and of great benefit; those, on the other hand, who find it<br/>irksome, and repine, are no true monks, and have made a mistake in<br/>entering the monastery- their proper place is in the world. Even in<br/>the temple one cannot be safe from sin and the devil. So it was no<br/>good taking it too much into account."<br/><br/>"He is weaker, a drowsiness has come over him," Father Paissy<br/>whispered to Alyosha, as he blessed him. "It's difficult to rouse<br/>him. And he must not be roused. He waked up for five minutes, sent<br/>his blessing to the brothers, and begged their prayers for him at<br/>night. He intends to take the sacrament again in the morning. He<br/>remembered you, Alexey. He asked whether you had gone away, and was<br/>told that you were in the town. 'I blessed him for that work,' he<br/>said, 'his place is there, not here, for awhile.' Those were his<br/>words about you. He remembered you lovingly, with anxiety; do you<br/>understand how he honoured you? But how is it that he has decided<br/>that you shall spend some time in the world? He must have foreseen<br/>something in your destiny! Understand, Alexey, that if you return<br/>to the world, it must be to do the duty laid upon you by your<br/>elder, and not for frivolous vanity and worldly pleasures."<br/><br/>Father Paissy went out. Alyosha had no doubt that Father Zossima<br/>was dying, though he might live another day or two. Alyosha firmly<br/>and ardently resolved that in spite of his promises to his father,<br/>the Hohlakovs, and Katerina Ivanovna, he would not leave the<br/>monastery next day, but would remain with his elder to the end. His<br/>heart glowed with love, and he reproached himself bitterly for<br/>having been able for one instant to forget him whom he had left in<br/>the monastery on his death bed, and whom he honoured above everyone<br/>in the world. He went into Father Zossima's bedroom, knelt down,<br/>and bowed to the ground before the elder, who slept quietly without<br/>stirring, with regular, hardly audible breathing and a peaceful<br/>face.<br/><br/>Alyosha returned to the other room, where Father Zossima<br/>received his guests in the morning. Taking off his boots, he lay<br/>down on the hard, narrow, leathern sofa, which he had long used as<br/>a bed, bringing nothing but a pillow. The mattress, about which his<br/>father had shouted to him that morning, he had long forgotten to<br/>lie on. He took off his cassock, which he used as a covering. But<br/>before going to bed, he fell on his knees and prayed a long time.<br/>In his fervent prayer he did not beseech God to lighten his<br/>darkness but only thirsted for the joyous emotion, which always<br/>visited his soul after the praise and adoration, of which his<br/>evening prayer usually consisted. That joy always brought him light<br/>untroubled sleep. As he was praying, he suddenly felt in his pocket<br/>the little pink note the servant had handed him as he left Katerina<br/>Ivanovna's. He was disturbed, but finished his prayer. Then, after<br/>some hesitation, he opened the envelope. In it was a letter to him,<br/>signed by Lise, the young daughter of Madame Hohlakov, who had<br/>laughed at him before the elder in the morning.<br/><br/>"Alexey Fyodorovitch," she wrote, "I am writing to you without<br/>anyone's knowledge, even mamma's, and I know how wrong it is. But I<br/>cannot live without telling you the feeling that has sprung up in<br/>my heart, and this no one but us two must know for a time. But how<br/>am I to say what I want so much to tell you? Paper, they say, does<br/>not blush, but I assure you it's not true and that it's blushing<br/>just as I am now, all over. Dear Alyosha, I love you, I've loved<br/>you from my childhood, since our Moscow days, when you were very<br/>different from what you are now, and I shall love you all my life.<br/>My heart has chosen you, to unite our lives, and pass them together<br/>till our old age. Of course, on condition that you will leave the<br/>monastery. As for our age we will wait for the time fixed by the<br/>law. By that time I shall certainly be quite strong, I shall be<br/>walking and dancing. There can be no doubt of that.<br/><br/>"You see how I've thought of everything. There's only one thing<br/>I can't imagine: what you'll think of me when you read this. I'm<br/>always laughing and being naughty. I made you angry this morning,<br/>but I assure you before I took up my pen, I prayed before the Image<br/>of the Mother of God, and now I'm praying, and almost crying.<br/><br/>"My secret is in your hands. When you come to-morrow, I don't<br/>know how I shall look at you. Ah, Alexey Fyodorovitch, what if I<br/>can't restrain myself like a silly and laugh when I look at you as<br/>I did to-day. You'll think I'm a nasty girl making fun of you, and<br/>you won't believe my letter. And so I beg you, dear one, if you've<br/>any pity for me, when you come to-morrow, don't look me straight in<br/>the face, for if I meet your eyes, it will be sure to make me<br/>laugh, especially as you'll be in that long gown. I feel cold all<br/>over when I think of it, so when you come, don't look at me at all<br/>for a time, look at mamma or at the window… .<br/><br/>
