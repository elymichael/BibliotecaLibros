<br/>"Just as he did God, then?" observed Alyosha.<br/><br/>"'It's wonderful how you can turn words,' as Polonius says in<br/>Hamlet," laughed Ivan. "You turn my words against me. Well, I am<br/>glad. Yours must be a fine God, if man created Him in his image and<br/>likeness. You asked just now what I was driving at. You see, I am<br/>fond of collecting certain facts, and, would you believe, I even<br/>copy anecdotes of a certain sort from newspapers and books, and<br/>I've already got a fine collection. The Turks, of course, have gone<br/>into it, but they are foreigners. I have specimens from home that<br/>are even better than the Turks. You know we prefer beating- rods<br/>and scourges- that's our national institution. Nailing ears is<br/>unthinkable for us, for we are, after all, Europeans. But the rod<br/>and the scourge we have always with us and they cannot be taken<br/>from us. Abroad now they scarcely do any beating. Manners are more<br/>humane, or laws have been passed, so that they don't dare to flog<br/>men now. But they make up for it in another way just as national as<br/>ours. And so national that it would be practically impossible among<br/>us, though I believe we are being inoculated with it, since the<br/>religious movement began in our aristocracy. I have a charming<br/>pamphlet, translated from the French, describing how, quite<br/>recently, five years ago, a murderer, Richard, was executed- a<br/>young man, I believe, of three and twenty, who repented and was<br/>converted to the Christian faith at the very scaffold. This Richard<br/>was an illegitimate child who was given as a child of six by his<br/>parents to some shepherds on the Swiss mountains. They brought him<br/>up to work for them. He grew up like a little wild beast among<br/>them. The shepherds taught him nothing, and scarcely fed or clothed<br/>him, but sent him out at seven to herd the flock in cold and wet,<br/>and no one hesitated or scrupled to treat him so. Quite the<br/>contrary, they thought they had every right, for Richard had been<br/>given to them as a chattel, and they did not even see the necessity<br/>of feeding him. Richard himself describes how in those years, like<br/>the Prodigal Son in the Gospel, he longed to eat of the mash given<br/>to the pigs, which were fattened for sale. But they wouldn't even<br/>give that, and beat him when he stole from the pigs. And that was<br/>how he spent all his childhood and his youth, till he grew up and<br/>was strong enough to go away and be a thief. The savage began to<br/>earn his living as a day labourer in Geneva. He drank what he<br/>earned, he lived like a brute, and finished by killing and robbing<br/>an old man. He was caught, tried, and condemned to death. They are<br/>not sentimentalists there. And in prison he was immediately<br/>surrounded by pastors, members of Christian brotherhoods,<br/>philanthropic ladies, and the like. They taught him to read and<br/>write in prison, and expounded the Gospel to him. They exhorted<br/>him, worked upon him, drummed at him incessantly, till at last he<br/>solemnly confessed his crime. He was converted. He wrote to the<br/>court himself that he was a monster, but that in the end God had<br/>vouchsafed him light and shown grace. All Geneva was in excitement<br/>about him- all philanthropic and religious Geneva. All the<br/>aristocratic and well-bred society of the town rushed to the<br/>prison, kissed Richard and embraced him; 'You are our brother, you<br/>have found grace.' And Richard does nothing but weep with emotion,<br/>'Yes, I've found grace! All my youth and childhood I was glad of<br/>pigs' food, but now even I have found grace. I am dying in the<br/>Lord.' 'Yes, Richard, die in the Lord; you have shed blood and must<br/>die. Though it's not your fault that you knew not the Lord, when<br/>you coveted the pigs' food and were beaten for stealing it (which<br/>was very wrong of you, for stealing is forbidden); but you've shed<br/>blood and you must die.'And on the last day, Richard, perfectly<br/>limp, did nothing but cry and repeat every minute: 'This is my<br/>happiest day. I am going to the Lord.' 'Yes,' cry the pastors and<br/>the judges and philanthropic ladies. 'This is the happiest day of<br/>your life, for you are going to the Lord!' They all walk or drive<br/>to the scaffold in procession behind the prison van. At the<br/>scaffold they call to Richard: 'Die, brother, die in the Lord, for<br/>even thou hast found grace!' And so, covered with his brothers'<br/>kisses, Richard is dragged on to the scaffold, and led to the<br/>guillotine. And they chopped off his head in brotherly fashion,<br/>because he had found grace. Yes, that's characteristic. That<br/>pamphlet is translated into Russian by some Russian philanthropists<br/>of aristocratic rank and evangelical aspirations, and has been<br/>distributed gratis for the enlightenment of the people. The case of<br/>Richard is interesting because it's national. Though to us it's<br/>absurd to cut off a man's head, because he has become our brother<br/>and has found grace, yet we have our own speciality, which is all<br/>but worse. Our historical pastime is the direct satisfaction of<br/>inflicting pain. There are lines in Nekrassov describing how a<br/>peasant lashes a horse on the eyes, 'on its meek eyes,' everyone<br/>must have seen it. It's peculiarly Russian. He describes how a<br/>feeble little nag has foundered under too heavy a load and cannot<br/>move. The peasant beats it, beats it savagely, beats it at last not<br/>knowing what he is doing in the intoxication of cruelty, thrashes<br/>it mercilessly over and over again. 'However weak you are, you must<br/>pull, if you die for it.' The nag strains, and then he begins<br/>lashing the poor defenceless creature on its weeping, on its 'meek<br/>eyes.' The frantic beast tugs and draws the load, trembling all<br/>over, gasping for breath, moving sideways, with a sort of unnatural<br/>spasmodic action- it's awful in Nekrassov. But that only a horse,<br/>and God has horses to be beaten. So the Tatars have taught us, and<br/>they left us the knout as a remembrance of it. But men, too, can be<br/>beaten. A well-educated, cultured gentleman and his wife beat their<br/>own child with a birch-rod, a girl of seven. I have an exact<br/>account of it. The papa was glad that the birch was covered with<br/>twigs. 'It stings more,' said he, and so be began stinging his<br/>daughter. I know for a fact there are people who at every blow are<br/>worked up to sensuality, to literal sensuality, which increases<br/>progressively at every blow they inflict. They beat for a minute,<br/>for five minutes, for ten minutes, more often and more savagely.<br/>The child screams. At last the child cannot scream, it gasps,<br/>'Daddy daddy!' By some diabolical unseemly chance the case was<br/>brought into court. A counsel is engaged. The Russian people have<br/>long called a barrister 'a conscience for hire.' The counsel<br/>protests in his client's defence. 'It's such a simple thing,' he<br/>says, 'an everyday domestic event. A father corrects his child. To<br/>our shame be it said, it is brought into court.' The jury,<br/>convinced by him, give a favourable verdict. The public roars with<br/>delight that the torturer is acquitted. Ah, pity I wasn't there! I<br/>would have proposed to raise a subscription in his honour! Charming<br/>pictures.<br/><br/>"But I've still better things about children. I've collected a<br/>great, great deal about Russian children, Alyosha. There was a<br/>little girl of five who was hated by her father and mother, 'most<br/>worthy and respectable people, of good education and breeding.' You<br/>see, I must repeat again, it is a peculiar characteristic of many<br/>people, this love of torturing children, and children only. To all<br/>other types of humanity these torturers behave mildly and<br/>benevolently, like cultivated and humane Europeans; but they are<br/>very fond of tormenting children, even fond of children themselves<br/>in that sense. it's just their defencelessness that tempts the<br/>tormentor, just the angelic confidence of the child who has no<br/>refuge and no appeal, that sets his vile blood on fire. In every<br/>man, of course, a demon lies hidden- the demon of rage, the demon<br/>of lustful heat at the screams of the tortured victim, the demon of<br/>lawlessness let off the chain, the demon of diseases that follow on<br/>vice, gout, kidney disease, and so on.<br/><br/>"This poor child of five was subjected to every possible torture<br/>by those cultivated parents. They beat her, thrashed her, kicked<br/>her for no reason till her body was one bruise. Then, they went to<br/>greater refinements of cruelty- shut her up all night in the cold<br/>and frost in a privy, and because she didn't ask to be taken up at<br/>night (as though a child of five sleeping its angelic, sound sleep<br/>could be trained to wake and ask), they smeared her face and filled<br/>her mouth with excrement, and it was her mother, her mother did<br/>this. And that mother could sleep, hearing the poor child's groans!<br/>Can you understand why a little creature, who can't even understand<br/>what's done to her, should beat her little aching heart with her<br/>tiny fist in the dark and the cold, and weep her meek unresentful<br/>tears to dear, kind God to protect her? Do you understand that,<br/>friend and brother, you pious and humble novice? Do you understand<br/>why this infamy must be and is permitted? Without it, I am told,<br/>man could not have existed on earth, for he could not have known<br/>good and evil. Why should he know that diabolical good and evil<br/>when it costs so much? Why, the whole world of knowledge is not<br/>worth that child's prayer to dear, kind God'! I say nothing of the<br/>sufferings of grown-up people, they have eaten the apple, damn<br/>them, and the devil take them all! But these little ones! I am<br/>making you suffer, Alyosha, you are not yourself. I'll leave off if<br/>you like."<br/><br/>"Nevermind. I want to suffer too," muttered Alyosha.<br/><br/>"One picture, only one more, because it's so curious, so<br/>characteristic, and I have only just read it in some collection of<br/>Russian antiquities. I've forgotten the name. I must look it up. It<br/>was in the darkest days of serfdom at the beginning of the century,<br/>and long live the Liberator of the People! There was in those days<br/>a general of aristocratic connections, the owner of great estates,<br/>one of those men- somewhat exceptional, I believe, even then- who,<br/>retiring from the service into a life of leisure, are convinced<br/>that they've earned absolute power over the lives of their<br/>subjects. There were such men then. So our general, settled on his<br/>property of two thousand souls, lives in pomp, and domineers over<br/>his poor neighbours as though they were dependents and buffoons. He<br/>has kennels of hundreds of hounds and nearly a hundred dog-boys-<br/>all mounted, and in uniform. One day a serf-boy, a little child of<br/>eight, threw a stone in play and hurt the paw of the general's<br/>favourite hound. 'Why is my favourite dog lame?' He is told that<br/>the boy threw a stone that hurt the dog's paw. 'So you did it.' The<br/>general looked the child up and down. 'Take him.' He was taken-<br/>taken from his mother and kept shut up all night. Early that<br/>morning the general comes out on horseback, with the hounds, his<br/>dependents, dog-boys, and huntsmen, all mounted around him in full<br/>hunting parade. The servants are summoned for their edification,<br/>and in front of them all stands the mother of the child. The child<br/>is brought from the lock-up. It's a gloomy, cold, foggy, autumn<br/>day, a capital day for hunting. The general orders the child to be<br/>undressed; the child is stripped naked. He shivers, numb with<br/>terror, not daring to cry… . 'Make him run,' commands the general.<br/>'Run! run!' shout the dog-boys. The boy runs… . 'At him!' yells the<br/>general, and he sets the whole pack of hounds on the child. The<br/>hounds catch him, and tear him to pieces before his mother's eyes!…<br/>I believe the general was afterwards declared incapable of<br/>administering his estates. Well- what did he deserve? To be shot?<br/>To be shot for the satisfaction of our moral feelings? Speak,<br/>Alyosha!<br/><br/>"To be shot," murmured Alyosha, lifting his eyes to Ivan with a<br/>pale, twisted smile.<br/><br/>"Bravo!" cried Ivan delighted. "If even you say so… You're a<br/>pretty monk! So there is a little devil sitting in your heart,<br/>Alyosha Karamazov!"<br/><br/>"What I said was absurd, but-"<br/><br/>"That's just the point, that 'but'!" cried Ivan. "Let me tell<br/>you, novice, that the absurd is only too necessary on earth. The<br/>world stands on absurdities, and perhaps nothing would have come to<br/>pass in it without them. We know what we know!"<br/><br/>
