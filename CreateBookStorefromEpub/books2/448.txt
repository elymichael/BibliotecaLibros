"In the first place I am capable of thinking for myself without
being taught. Besides, what I said just now about the classics
being translated our teacher Kolbasnikov has said to the whole of
the third class."

"The doctor has come!" cried Nina, who had been silent till
then.

A carriage belonging to Madame Hohlakov drove up to the gate.
The captain, who had been expecting the doctor all the morning,
rushed headlong out to meet him. "Mamma" pulled herself together
and assumed a dignified air. Alyosha went up to Ilusha and began
setting his pillows straight. Nina, from her invalid chair,
anxiously watched him putting the bed tidy. The boys hurriedly took
leave. Some of them promised to come again in the evening. Kolya
called Perezvon and the dog jumped off the bed.

"I won't go away, I won't go away," Kolya said hastily to
Ilusha. "I'll wait in the passage and come back when the doctor's
gone, I'll come back with Perezvon."

But by now the doctor had entered, an important-looking person
with long, dark whiskers and a shiny, shaven chin, wearing a
bearskin coat. As he crossed the threshold he stopped, taken aback;
he probably fancied he had come to the wrong place. "How is this?
Where am I?" he muttered, not removing his coat nor his peaked
sealskin cap. The crowd, the poverty of the room, the washing
hanging on a line in the corner, puzzled him. The captain, bent
double, was bowing low before him.

"It's here, sir, here, sir," he muttered cringingly; "it's here,
you've come right, you were coming to usâ€¦ "

"Sne-gi-ryov?" the doctor said loudly and pompously. "Mr.
Snegiryov- is that you?"

"That's me, sir!"

"Ah!"

The doctor looked round the room with a squeamish air once more
and threw off his coat, displaying to all eyes the grand decoration
at his neck. The captain caught the fur coat in the air, and the
doctor took off his cap.
