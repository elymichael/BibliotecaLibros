"Oh, how sweet and generous that would be of you" cried Lise<br/>with sudden animation. "I told mamma you'd be sure not to go. I<br/>said you were saving your soul. How splendid you are I've always<br/>thought you were splendid. How glad I am to tell you so!"<br/><br/>"Lise!" said her mother impressively, though she smiled after<br/>she had said it.<br/><br/>"You have quite forgotten us, Alexey Fyodorovitch," she said;<br/>"you never come to see us. Yet Lise has told me twice that she is<br/>never happy except with you."<br/><br/>Alyosha raised his downcast eyes and again flushed, and again<br/>smiled without knowing why. But the elder was no longer watching<br/>him. He had begun talking to a monk who, as mentioned before, had<br/>been awaiting his entrance by Lise's chair. He was evidently a monk<br/>of the humblest, that is of the peasant, class, of a narrow<br/>outlook, but a true believer, and, in his own way, a stubborn one.<br/>He announced that he had come from the far north, from Obdorsk,<br/>from Saint Sylvester, and was a member of a poor monastery,<br/>consisting of only ten monks. The elder gave him his blessing and<br/>invited him to come to his cell whenever he liked.<br/><br/>"How can you presume to do such deeds?" the monk asked suddenly,<br/>pointing solemnly and significantly at Lise. He was referring to<br/>her "healing."<br/><br/>"It's too early, of course, to speak of that. Relief is not<br/>complete cure, and may proceed from different causes. But if there<br/>has been any healing, it is by no power but God's will. It's all<br/>from God. Visit me, Father," he added to the monk. "It's not often<br/>I can see visitors. I am ill, and I know that my days are<br/>numbered."<br/><br/>"Oh, no, no! God will not take you from us. You will live a<br/>long, long time yet," cried the lady. "And in what way are you ill?<br/>You look so well, so gay and happy."<br/><br/>"I am extraordinarily better to-day. But I know that it's only<br/>for a moment. I understand my disease now thoroughly. If I seem so<br/>happy to you, you could never say anything that would please me so<br/>much. For men are made for happiness, and anyone who is completely<br/>happy has a right to say to himself, 'I am doing God's will on<br/>earth.' All the righteous, all the saints, all the holy martyrs<br/>were happy."<br/><br/>"Oh, how you speak! What bold and lofty words" cried the lady.<br/>"You seem to pierce with your words. And yet- happiness, happiness-<br/>where is it? Who can say of himself that he is happy? Oh, since you<br/>have been so good as to let us see you once more to-day, let me<br/>tell you what I could not utter last time, what I dared not say,<br/>all I am suffering and have been for so long! I am suffering!<br/>Forgive me! I am suffering!"<br/><br/>And in a rush of fervent feeling she clasped her hands before<br/>him.<br/><br/>"From what specially?"<br/>
