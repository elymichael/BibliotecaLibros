<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>1<br/>Plans for Mitya's Escape<br/><br/><br/>VERY early, at nine o'clock in the morning, five days after the<br/>trial, Alyosha went to Katerina Ivanovna's to talk over a matter of<br/>great importance to both of them, and to give her a message. She<br/>sat and talked to him in the very room in which she had once<br/>received Grushenka. In the next room Ivan Fyodorovitch lay<br/>unconscious in a high fever. Katerina Ivanovna had immediately<br/>after the scene at the trial ordered the sick and unconscious man<br/>to be carried to her house, disregarding the inevitable gossip and<br/>general disapproval of the public. One of two relations who lived<br/>with her had departed to Moscow immediately after the scene in<br/>court, the other remained. But if both had gone away, Katerina<br/>Ivanovna would have adhered to her resolution, and would have gone<br/>on nursing the sick man and sitting by him day and night. Varvinsky<br/>and Herzenstube were attending him. The famous doctor had gone back<br/>to Moscow, refusing to give an opinion as to the probable end of<br/>the illness. Though the doctors encouraged Katerina Ivanovna and<br/>Alyosha, it was evident that they could not yet give them positive<br/>hopes of recovery.<br/><br/>Alyosha came to see his sick brother twice a day. But this time<br/>he had specially urgent business, and he foresaw how difficult it<br/>would be to approach the subject, yet he was in great haste. He had<br/>another engagement that could not be put off for that same morning,<br/>and there was need of haste.<br/><br/>They had been talking for a quarter of an hour. Katerina<br/>Ivanovna was pale and terribly fatigued, yet at the same time in a<br/>state of hysterical excitement. She had a presentiment of the<br/>reason why Alyosha had come to her.<br/><br/>"Don't worry about his decision," she said, with confident<br/>emphasis to Alyosha. "One way or another he is bound to come to it.<br/>He must escape. That unhappy man, that hero of honour and<br/>principle- not he, not Dmitri Fyodorovitch, but the man lying the<br/>other side of that door, who has sacrificed himself for his<br/>brother," Katya added, with flashing eyes- "told me the whole plan<br/>of escape long ago. You know he has already entered into<br/>negotiations… . I've told you something already… . You see, it will<br/>probably come off at the third etape from here, when the party of<br/>prisoners is being taken to Siberia. Oh, it's a long way off yet.<br/>Ivan Fyodorovitch has already visited the superintendent of the<br/>third etape. But we don't know yet who will be in charge of the<br/>party, and it's impossible to find that out so long beforehand.<br/>To-morrow, perhaps, I will show you in detail the whole plan which<br/>Ivan Fyodorovitch left me on the eve of the trial in case of need…<br/>. That was when- do you remember?- you found us quarrelling. He had<br/>just gone downstairs, but seeing you I made him come back; do you<br/>remember? Do you know what we were quarrelling about then?"<br/><br/>"No, I don't," said Alyosha.<br/><br/>"Of course he did not tell you. It was about that plan of<br/>escape. He had told me the main idea three days before, and we<br/>began quarrelling about it at once and quarrelled for three days.<br/>We quarrelled because, when he told me that if Dmitri Fyodorovitch<br/>were convicted he would escape abroad with that creature, I felt<br/>furious at once- I can't tell you why, I don't know myself why… .<br/>Oh, of course, I was furious then about that creature, and that<br/>she, too, should go abroad with Dmitri!" Katerina Ivanovna<br/>exclaimed suddenly, her lips quivering with anger. "As soon as Ivan<br/>Fyodorovitch saw that I was furious about that woman, he instantly<br/>imagined I was jealous of Dmitri and that I still loved Dmitri.<br/>That is how our first quarrel began. I would not give an<br/>explanation, I could not ask forgiveness. I could not bear to think<br/>that such a man could suspect me of still loving that… and when I<br/>myself had told him long before that I did not love Dmitri, that I<br/>loved no one but him! It was only resentment against that creature<br/>that made me angry with him. Three days later, on the evening you<br/>came, he brought me a sealed envelope, which I was to open at once,<br/>if anything happened to him. Oh, he foresaw his illness! He told me<br/>that the envelope contained the details of the escape, and that if<br/>he died or was taken dangerously ill, I was to save Mitya alone.<br/>Then he left me money, nearly ten thousand- those notes to which<br/>the prosecutor referred in his speech, having learnt from someone<br/>that he had sent them to be changed. I was tremendously impressed<br/>to find that Ivan Fyodorovitch had not given up his idea of saving<br/>his brother, and was confiding this plan of escape to me, though he<br/>was still jealous of me and still convinced that I loved Mitya. Oh,<br/>that was a sacrifice! No, you cannot understand the greatness of<br/>such self-sacrifice, Alexey Fyodorovitch. I wanted to fall at his<br/>feet in reverence, but I thought at once that he would take it only<br/>for my joy at the thought of Mitya's being saved (and he certainly<br/>would have imagined that!), and I was so exasperated at the mere<br/>possibility of such an unjust thought on his part that I lost my<br/>temper again, and instead of kissing his feet, flew into a fury<br/>again! Oh, I am unhappy! It's my character, my awful, unhappy<br/>character! Oh, you will see, I shall end by driving him, too, to<br/>abandon me for another with whom he can get on better, like Dmitri.<br/>But… no, I could not bear it, I should kill myself. And when you<br/>came in then, and when I called to you and told him to come back, I<br/>was so enraged by the look of contempt and hatred he turned on me<br/>that do you remember?- I cried out to you that it was he, he alone<br/>who had persuaded me that his brother Dmitri was a murderer! I said<br/>that malicious thing on purpose to wound him again. He had never,<br/>never persuaded me that his brother was a murderer. On the<br/>contrary, it was I who persuaded him! Oh, my vile temper was the<br/>cause of everything! I paved the way to that hideous scene at the<br/>trial. He wanted to show me that he was an honourable man, and<br/>that, even if I loved his brother, he would not ruin him for<br/>revenge or jealousy. So he came to the court… I am the cause of it<br/>all, I alone am to blame!"<br/><br/>Katya never had made such confessions to Alyosha before, and he<br/>felt that she was now at that stage of unbearable suffering when<br/>even the proudest heart painfully crushes its pride and falls<br/>vanquished by grief. Oh, Alyosha knew another terrible reason of<br/>her present misery, though she had carefully concealed it from him<br/>during those days since the trial; but it would have been, for some<br/>reason, too painful to him if she had been brought so low as to<br/>speak to him now about that. She was suffering for her "treachery"<br/>at the trial, and Alyosha felt that her conscience was impelling<br/>her to confess it to him, to him, Alyosha, with tears and cries and<br/>hysterical writhings on the floor. But he dreaded that moment and<br/>longed to spare her. It made the commission on which he had come<br/>even more difficult. He spoke of Mitya again.<br/>
