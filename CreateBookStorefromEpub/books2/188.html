"Substantially nothing- but just by way of conversation."<br/><br/>Another silence followed. They did not speak for nearly a<br/>minute. Ivan knew that he ought to get up and show anger, and<br/>Smerdyakov stood before him and seemed to be waiting as though to<br/>see whether he would be angry or not. So at least it seemed to<br/>Ivan. At last he moved to get up. Smerdyakov seemed to seize the<br/>moment.<br/><br/>"I'm in an awful position, Ivan Fyodorovitch. I don't know how<br/>to help myself," he said resolutely and distinctly, and at his last<br/>word he sighed. Ivan Fyodorovitch sat down again.<br/><br/>"They are both utterly crazy, they are no better than little<br/>children," Smerdyakov went on. "I am speaking of your parent and<br/>your brother Dmitri Fyodorovitch. Here Fyodor Pavlovitch will get<br/>up directly and begin worrying me every minute, 'Has she come? Why<br/>hasn't she come?' and so on up till midnight and even after<br/>midnight. And if Agrafena Alexandrovna doesn't come (for very<br/>likely she does not mean to come at all) then he will be at me<br/>again to-morrow morning, 'Why hasn't she come? When will she<br/>come?'- as though I were to blame for it. On the other side it's no<br/>better. As soon as it gets dark, or even before, your brother will<br/>appear with his gun in his hands: 'Look out, you rogue, you<br/>soup-maker. If you miss her and don't let me know she's been- I'll<br/>kill you before anyone.' When the night's over, in the morning, he,<br/>too, like Fyodor Pavlovitch, begins worrying me to death. 'Why<br/>hasn't she come? Will she come soon?' And he, too, thinks me to<br/>blame because his lady hasn't come. And every day and every hour<br/>they get angrier and angrier, so that I sometimes think I shall<br/>kill myself in a fright. I can't depend them, sir."<br/><br/>"And why have you meddled? Why did you begin to spy for Dmitri<br/>Fyodorovitch?" said Ivan irritably.<br/><br/>"How could I help meddling? Though, indeed, I haven't meddled at<br/>all, if you want to know the truth of the matter. I kept quiet from<br/>the very beginning, not daring to answer; but he pitched on me to<br/>be his servant. He has had only one thing to say since: 'I'll kill<br/>you, you scoundrel, if you miss her.' I feel certain, sir, that I<br/>shall have a long fit to-morrow."<br/><br/>"What do you mean by 'a long fit'?"<br/><br/>"A long fit, lasting a long time- several hours, or perhaps a<br/>day or two. Once it went on for three days. I fell from the garret<br/>that time. The struggling ceased and then began again, and for<br/>three days I couldn't come back to my senses. Fyodor Pavlovitch<br/>sent for Herzenstube, the doctor here, and he put ice on my head<br/>and tried another remedy, tooâ€¦ . I might have died."<br/><br/>"But they say one can't tell with epilepsy when a fit is coming.<br/>What makes you say you will have one to-morrow?" Ivan inquired,<br/>with a peculiar, irritable curiosity.<br/><br/>"That's just so. You can't tell beforehand."<br/><br/>"Besides, you fell from the garret then."<br/>
