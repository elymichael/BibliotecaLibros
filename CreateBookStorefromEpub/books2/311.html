<br/>"Aie! How tight you squeeze! You've quite broken my fingers,"<br/>laughed Kalganov.<br/><br/>"He always squeezes like that, always," Grushenka put in gaily,<br/>with a timid smile, seeming suddenly convinced from Mitya's face<br/>that he was not going to make a scene. She was watching him with<br/>intense curiosity and still some uneasiness. She was impressed by<br/>something about him, and indeed the last thing she expected of him<br/>was that he would come in and speak like this at such a moment.<br/><br/>"Good evening," Maximov ventured blandly on the left. Mitya<br/>rushed up to him, too.<br/><br/>"Good evening. You're here, too! How glad I am to find you here,<br/>too! Gentlemen, gentlemen, I- " (He addressed the Polish gentleman<br/>with the pipe again, evidently taking him for the most important<br/>person present.) "I flew here… . I wanted to spend my last day, my<br/>last hour in this room, in this very room&#160;… where I, too,<br/>adored… my queen… . Forgive me, Panie," he cried wildly, "I flew<br/>here and vowed- Oh, don't be afraid, it's my last night! Let's<br/>drink to our good understanding. They'll bring the wine at once… .<br/>I brought this with me." (Something made him pull out his bundle of<br/>notes.) "Allow me, panie! I want to have music, singing, a revel,<br/>as we had before. But the worm, the unnecessary worm, will crawl<br/>away, and there'll be no more of him. I will commemorate my day of<br/>joy on my last night."<br/><br/>He was almost choking. There was so much, so much he wanted to<br/>say, but strange exclamations were all that came from his lips. The<br/>Pole gazed fixedly at him, at the bundle of notes in his hand;<br/>looked at Grushenka, and was in evident perplexity.<br/><br/>"If my suverin lady is permitting- " he was beginning.<br/><br/>"What does 'suverin' mean? 'Sovereign,' I suppose?" interrupted<br/>Grushenka. "I can't help laughing at you, the way you talk. Sit<br/>down, Mitya, what are you talking about? Don't frighten us, please.<br/>You won't frighten us, will you? If you won't, I am glad to see<br/>you… "<br/><br/>"Me, me frighten you?" cried Mitya, flinging up his hands. "Oh,<br/>pass me by, go your way, I won't hinder you!… "<br/><br/>And suddenly he surprised them all, and no doubt himself as<br/>well, by flinging himself on a chair, and bursting into tears,<br/>turning his head away to the opposite wall, while his arms clasped<br/>the back of the chair tight, as though embracing it.<br/><br/>"Come, come, what a fellow you are!" cried Grushenka<br/>reproachfully. "That's just how he comes to see me- he begins<br/>talking, and I can't make out what he means. He cried like that<br/>once before, and now he's crying again! It's shamefull Why are you<br/>crying? As though you had anything to cry for!" she added<br/>enigmatically, emphasising each word with some irritability.<br/><br/>
