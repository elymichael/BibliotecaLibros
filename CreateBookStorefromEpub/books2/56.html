"Oh yes, I'd forgotten she was a relation of yours."<br/><br/>"A relation! That Grushenka a relation of mine!" cried Rakitin,<br/>turning crimson. "Are you mad? You're out of your mind!"<br/><br/>"Why, isn't she a relation of yours? I heard so."<br/><br/>"Where can you have heard it? You Karamazovs brag of being an<br/>ancient, noble family, though your father used to run about playing<br/>the buffoon at other men's tables, and was only admitted to the<br/>kitchen as a favour. I may be only a priest's son, and dirt in the<br/>eyes of noblemen like you, but don't insult me so lightly and<br/>wantonly. I have a sense of honour, too, Alexey Fyodorovitch, I<br/>couldn't be a relation of Grushenka, a common harlot. I beg you to<br/>understand that!"<br/><br/>Rakitin was intensely irritated.<br/><br/>"Forgive me, for goodness' sake, I had no idea… besides… how can<br/>you call her a harlot? Is she… that sort of woman?" Alyosha flushed<br/>suddenly. "I tell you again, I heard that she was a relation of<br/>yours. You often go to see her, and you told me yourself you're not<br/>her lover. I never dreamed that you of all people had such contempt<br/>for her! Does she really deserve it?"<br/><br/>"I may have reasons of my own for visiting her. That's not your<br/>business. But as for relationship, your brother, or even your<br/>father, is more likely to make her yours than mine. Well, here we<br/>are. You'd better go to the kitchen. Hullo! what's wrong, what is<br/>it? Are we late? They can't have finished dinner so soon! Have the<br/>Karamazovs been making trouble again? No doubt they have. Here's<br/>your father and your brother Ivan after him. They've broken out<br/>from the Father Superior's. And look, Father Isidor's shouting out<br/>something after them from the steps. And your father's shouting and<br/>waving his arms. I expect he's swearing. Bah, and there goes Miusov<br/>driving away in his carriage. You see, he's going. And there's old<br/>Maximov running!- there must have been a row. There can't have been<br/>any dinner. Surely they've not been beating the Father Superior! Or<br/>have they, perhaps, been beaten? It would serve them right!"<br/><br/>There was reason for Rakitin's exclamations. There had been a<br/>scandalous, an unprecedented scene. It had all come from the<br/>impulse of a moment.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
