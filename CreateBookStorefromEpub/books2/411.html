<br/>Dardanelov was a middle-aged bachelor, who had been passionately<br/>in love with Madame Krassotkin for many years past, and had once<br/>already, about a year previously, ventured, trembling with fear and<br/>the delicacy of his sentiments, to offer her most respectfully his<br/>hand in marriage. But she refused him resolutely, feeling that to<br/>accept him would be an act of treachery to her son, though<br/>Dardanelov had, to judge from certain mysterious symptoms, reason<br/>for believing that he was not an object of aversion to the charming<br/>but too chaste and tender-hearted widow. Kolya's mad prank seemed<br/>to have broken the ice, and Dardanelov was rewarded for his<br/>intercession by a suggestion of hope. The suggestion, it is true,<br/>was a faint one, but then Dardanelov was such a paragon of purity<br/>and delicacy that it was enough for the time being to make him<br/>perfectly happy. He was fond of the boy, though he would have felt<br/>it beneath him to try and win him over, and was severe and strict<br/>with him in class. Kolya, too, kept him at a respectful distance.<br/>He learned his lessons perfectly; he was second in his class, was<br/>reserved with Dardanelov, and the whole class firmly believed that<br/>Kolya was so good at universal history that he could "beat" even<br/>Dardanelov. Kolya did indeed ask him the question, "Who founded<br/>Troy?" to which Dardanelov had made a very vague reply, referring<br/>to the movements and migrations of races, to the remoteness of the<br/>period, to the mythical legends. But the question, "Who had founded<br/>Troy?" that is, what individuals, he could not answer, and even for<br/>some reason regarded the question as idle and frivolous. But the<br/>boys remained convinced that Dardanelov did not know who founded<br/>Troy. Kolya had read of the founders of Troy in Smaragdov, whose<br/>history was among the books in his father's bookcase. In the end<br/>all the boys became interested in the question, who it was that had<br/>founded Troy, but Krassotkin would not tell his secret, and his<br/>reputation for knowledge remained unshaken.<br/><br/>After the incident on the railway a certain change came over<br/>Kolya's attitude to his mother. When Anna Fyodorovna (Madame<br/>Krassotkin) heard of her son's exploit, she almost went out of her<br/>mind with horror. She had such terrible attacks of hysterics,<br/>lasting with intervals for several days, that Kolya, seriously<br/>alarmed at last, promised on his honour that such pranks should<br/>never be repeated. He swore on his knees before the holy image, and<br/>swore by the memory of his father, at Madame Krassotkin's instance,<br/>and the "manly" Kolya burst into tears like a boy of six. And all<br/>that day the mother and son were constantly rushing into each<br/>other's arms sobbing. Next day Kolya woke up as "unfeeling" as<br/>before, but he had become more silent, more modest, sterner, and<br/>more thoughtful.<br/><br/>Six weeks later, it is true, he got into another scrape, which<br/>even brought his name to the ears of our Justice of the Peace, but<br/>it was a scrape of quite another kind, amusing, foolish, and he did<br/>not, as it turned out, take the leading part in it, but was only<br/>implicated in it. But of this later. His mother still fretted and<br/>trembled, but the more uneasy she became, the greater were the<br/>hopes of Dardanelov. It must be noted that Kolya understood and<br/>divined what was in Dardanelov's heart and, of course, despised him<br/>profoundly for his "feelings"; he had in the past been so tactless<br/>as to show this contempt before his mother, hinting vaguely that he<br/>knew what Dardanelov was after. But from the time of the railway<br/>incident his behaviour in this respect also was changed; he did not<br/>allow himself the remotest allusion to the subject and began to<br/>speak more respectfully of Dardanelov before his mother, which the<br/>sensitive woman at once appreciated with boundless gratitude. But<br/>at the slightest mention of Dardanelov by a visitor in Kolya's<br/>presence, she would flush as pink as a rose. At such moments Kolya<br/>would either stare out of the window scowling, or would investigate<br/>the state of his boots, or would shout angrily for "Perezvon," the<br/>big, shaggy, mangy dog, which he had picked up a month before,<br/>brought home, and kept for some reason secretly indoors, not<br/>showing him to any of his schoolfellows. He bullied him<br/>frightfully, teaching him all sorts of tricks, so that the poor dog<br/>howled for him whenever he was absent at school, and when he came<br/>in, whined with delight, rushed about as if he were crazy, begged,<br/>lay down on the ground pretending to be dead, and so on; in fact,<br/>showed all the tricks he had taught him, not at the word of<br/>command, but simply from the zeal of his excited and grateful<br/>heart.<br/><br/>I have forgotten, by the way, to mention that Kolya Krassotkin<br/>was the boy stabbed with a penknife by the boy already known to the<br/>reader as the son of Captain Snegiryov. Ilusha had been defending<br/>his father when the schoolboys jeered at him, shouting the nickname<br/>"wisp of tow."<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
