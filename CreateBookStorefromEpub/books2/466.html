<br/>"Yes; but I don't think you will be able to go."<br/><br/>"I can sit up. Ah, you put me out! Ah! this trial, this savage<br/>act, and then they are all going to Siberia, some are getting<br/>married, and all this so quickly, so quickly, everything's<br/>changing, and at last- nothing. All grow old and have death to look<br/>forward to. Well, so be it! I am weary. This Katya, cette charmante<br/>personne, has disappointed all my hopes. Now she is going to follow<br/>one of your brothers to Siberia, and your other brother is going to<br/>follow her, and will live in the nearest town, and they will all<br/>torment one another. It drives me out of my mind. Worst of all- the<br/>publicity. The story has been told a million times over in all the<br/>papers in Moscow and Petersburg. Ah! yes, would you believe it,<br/>there's a paragraph that I was 'a dear friend' of your brother's- ,<br/>I can't repeat the horrid word. just fancy, just fancy!"<br/><br/>"Impossible! Where was the paragraph? What did it say?"<br/><br/>"I'll show you directly. I got the paper and read it yesterday.<br/>Here, in the Petersburg paper Gossip. The paper began coming out<br/>this year. I am awfully fond of gossip, and I take it in, and now<br/>it pays me out- this is what gossip comes to! Here it is, here,<br/>this passage. Read it."<br/><br/>And she handed Alyosha a sheet of newspaper which had been under<br/>her pillow.<br/><br/>It was not exactly that she was upset, she seemed overwhelmed<br/>and perhaps everything really was mixed up in a tangle in her head.<br/>The paragraph was very typical, and must have been a great shock to<br/>her, but, fortunately perhaps, she was unable to keep her mind<br/>fixed on any one subject at that moment, and so might race off in a<br/>minute to something else and quite forget the newspaper.<br/><br/>Alyosha was well aware that the story of the terrible case had<br/>spread all over Russia. And, good heavens! what wild rumours about<br/>his brother, about the Karamazovs, and about himself he had read in<br/>the course of those two months, among other equally credible items!<br/>One paper had even stated that he had gone into a monastery and<br/>become a monk, in horror at his brother's crime. Another<br/>contradicted this, and stated that he and his elder, Father<br/>Zossima, had broken into the monastery chest and "made tracks from<br/>the monastery." The present paragraph in the paper Gossip was under<br/>the heading, "The Karamazov Case at Skotoprigonyevsk." (That, alas!<br/>was the name of our little town. I had hitherto kept it concealed.)<br/>It was brief, and Madame Hohlakov was not directly mentioned in it.<br/>No names appeared, in fact. It was merely stated that the criminal,<br/>whose approaching trial was making such a sensation- retired army<br/>captain, an idle swaggerer, and reactionary bully- was continually<br/>involved in amorous intrigues, and particularly popular with<br/>certain ladies "who were pining in solitude." One such lady, a<br/>pining widow, who tried to seem young though she had a grown-up<br/>daughter, was so fascinated by him that only two hours before the<br/>crime she offered him three thousand roubles, on condition that he<br/>would elope with her to the gold mines. But the criminal, counting<br/>on escaping punishment, had preferred to murder his father to get<br/>the three thousand rather than go off to Siberia with the<br/>middle-aged charms of his pining lady. This playful paragraph<br/>finished, of course, with an outburst of generous indignation at<br/>the wickedness of parricide and at the lately abolished institution<br/>of serfdom. Reading it with curiosity, Alyosha folded up the paper<br/>and handed it back to Madame Hohlakov.<br/><br/>"Well, that must be me," she hurried on again. "Of course I am<br/>meant. Scarcely more than an hour before, I suggested gold mines to<br/>him, and here they talk of 'middle-aged charms' as though that were<br/>my motive! He writes that out of spite! God Almighty forgive him<br/>for the middle-aged charms, as I forgive him! You know it's -Do you<br/>know who it is? It's your friend Rakitin."<br/><br/>"Perhaps," said Alyosha, "though I've heard nothing about<br/>it."<br/><br/>"It's he, it's he! No 'perhaps' about it. You know I turned him<br/>out of the houseâ€¦ . You know all that story, don't you?"<br/><br/>
