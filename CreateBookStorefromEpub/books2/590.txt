"Better suffer all my life."

"You ought to go, you ought to go," Alyosha repeated with
merciless emphasis.

"But why to-day, why at once?… I can't leave our patient-"

"You can for a moment. It will only be a moment. If you don't
come, he will be in delirium by to-night. I would not tell you a
lie; have pity on him!"

"Have pity on me!" Katya said, with bitter reproach, and she
burst into tears.

"Then you will come," said Alyosha firmly, seeing her tears.
"I'll go and tell him you will come directly."

"No, don't tell him so on any account," cried Katya in alarm. "I
will come, but don't tell him beforehand, for perhaps I may go, but
not go in… I don't know yet-"

Her voice failed her. She gasped for breath. Alyosha got up to
go.

"And what if I meet anyone?" she said suddenly, in a low voice,
turning white again.

"That's just why you must go now, to avoid meeting anyone. There
will be no one there, I can tell you that for certain. We will
expect you," he concluded emphatically, and went out of the
room.
