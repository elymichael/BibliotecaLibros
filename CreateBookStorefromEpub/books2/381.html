He was asked to go back to the "other room." Mitya went in,<br/>scowling with anger, and trying to avoid looking at anyone. Dressed<br/>in another man's clothes he felt himself disgraced, even in the<br/>eyes of the peasants, and of Trifon Borissovitch, whose face<br/>appeared, for some reason, in the doorway, and vanished<br/>immediately. "He's come to look at me dressed up," thought Mitya.<br/>He sat down on the same chair as before. He had an absurd<br/>nightmarish feeling, as though he were out of his mind.<br/><br/>"Well, what now? Are you going to flog me? That's all that's<br/>left for you," he said, clenching his teeth and addressing the<br/>prosecutor. He would not turn to Nikolay Parfenovitch, as though he<br/>disdained to speak to him.<br/><br/>"He looked too closely at my socks, and turned them inside out<br/>on purpose to show everyone how dirty they were- the<br/>scoundrel!"<br/><br/>"Well, now we must proceed to the examination of witnesses,"<br/>observed Nikolay Parfenovitch, as though in reply to Mitya's<br/>question.<br/><br/>"Yes," said the prosecutor thoughtfully, as though reflecting on<br/>something.<br/><br/>"We've done what we could in your interest, Dmitri<br/>Fyodorovitch," Nikolay Parfenovitch went on, "but having received<br/>from you such an uncompromising refusal to explain to us the source<br/>from which you obtained the money found upon you, we are, at the<br/>present moment-"<br/><br/>"What is the stone in your ring?" Mitya interrupted suddenly, as<br/>though awakening from a reverie. He pointed to one of the three<br/>large rings adorning Nikolay Parfenovitch's right hand.<br/><br/>"Ring?" repeated Nikolay Parfenovitch with surprise.<br/><br/>"Yes, that one… on your middle finger, with the little veins in<br/>it, what stone is that?" Mitya persisted, like a peevish child.<br/><br/>"That's a smoky topaz," said Nikolay Parfenovitch, smiling.<br/>"Would you like to look at it? I'll take it off… "<br/><br/>"No, don't take it off," cried Mitya furiously, suddenly waking<br/>up, and angry with himself. "Don't take it off… there's no need… .<br/>Damn it!… Gentlemen, you've sullied my heart! Can you suppose that<br/>I would conceal it from you, if I had really killed my father, that<br/>I would shuffle, lie, and hide myself? No, that's not like Dmitri<br/>Karamazov, that he couldn't do, and if I were guilty, I swear I<br/>shouldn't have waited for your coming, or for the sunrise as I<br/>meant at first, but should have killed myself before this, without<br/>waiting for the dawn! I know that about myself now. I couldn't have<br/>learnt so much in twenty years as I've found out in this accursed<br/>night!… And should I have been like this on this night, and at this<br/>moment, sitting with you, could I have talked like this, could I<br/>have moved like this, could I have looked at you and at the world<br/>like this, if I had really been the murderer of my father, when the<br/>very thought of having accidentally killed Grigory gave me no peace<br/>all night- not from fear- oh, not simply from fear of your<br/>punishment! The disgrace of it! And you expect me to be open with<br/>such scoffers as you, who see nothing and believe in nothing, blind<br/>moles and scoffers, and to tell you another nasty thing I've done,<br/>another disgrace, even if that would save me from your accusation!<br/>No, better Siberia! The man who opened the door to my father and<br/>went in at that door, he killed him, he robbed him. Who was he? I'm<br/>racking my brains and can't think who. But I can tell you it was<br/>not Dmitri Karamazov, and that's all I can tell you, and that's<br/>enough, enough, leave me alone… . Exile me, punish me, but don't<br/>bother me any more. I'll say no more. Call your witnesses!"<br/>
