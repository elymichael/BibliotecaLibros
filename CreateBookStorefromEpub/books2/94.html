<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>8<br/>Over the Brandy<br/><br/><br/>THE controversy was over. But, strange to say, Fyodor<br/>Pavlovitch, who had been so gay, suddenly began frowning. He<br/>frowned and gulped brandy, and it was already a glass too much.<br/><br/>"Get along with you, Jesuits!" he cried to the servants. "Go<br/>away, Smerdyakov. I'll send you the gold piece I promised you<br/>to-day, but be off! Don't cry, Grigory. Go to Marfa. She'll comfort<br/>you and put you to bed. The rascals won't let us sit in peace after<br/>dinner," he snapped peevishly, as the servants promptly withdrew at<br/>his word.<br/><br/>"Smerdyakov always pokes himself in now, after dinner. It's you<br/>he's so interested in. What have you done to fascinate him?" he<br/>added to Ivan.<br/><br/>"Nothing whatever," answered Ivan. "He's pleased to have a high<br/>opinion of me; he's a lackey and a mean soul. Raw material for<br/>revolution, however, when the time comes."<br/><br/>"There will be others and better ones. But there will be some<br/>like him as well. His kind will come first, and better ones<br/>after."<br/><br/>"And when will the time come?"<br/><br/>"The rocket will go off and fizzle out, perhaps. The peasants<br/>are not very fond of listening to these soup-makers, so far."<br/>
