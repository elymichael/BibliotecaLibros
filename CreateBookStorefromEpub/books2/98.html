"Serve him right!" shouted Dmitri breathlessly. "If I haven't<br/>killed him, I'll come again and kill him. You can't protect<br/>him!"<br/><br/>"Dmitri! Go away at once!" cried Alyosha commandingly.<br/><br/>"Alexey! You tell me. It's only you I can believe; was she here<br/>just now, or not? I saw her myself creeping this way by the fence<br/>from the lane. I shouted, she ran away."<br/><br/>"I swear she's not been here, and no one expected her."<br/><br/>"But I saw her… . So she must… I'll find out at once where she<br/>is… . Good-bye, Alexey! Not a word to Aesop about the money now.<br/>But go to Katerina Ivanovna at once and be sure to say, 'He sends<br/>his compliments to you!' Compliments, his compliments! just<br/>compliments and farewell! Describe the scene to her."<br/><br/>Meanwhile Ivan and Grigory had raised the old man and seated him<br/>in an arm-chair. His face was covered with blood, but he was<br/>conscious and listened greedily to Dmitri's cries. He was still<br/>fancying that Grushenka really was somewhere in the house. Dmitri<br/>looked at him with hatred as he went out.<br/><br/>"I don't repent shedding your blood!" he cried. "Beware, old<br/>man, beware of your dream, for I have my dream, too. I curse you,<br/>and disown you altogether."<br/><br/>He ran out of the room.<br/><br/>"She's here. She must be here. Smerdyakov! Smerdyakov!" the old<br/>man wheezed, scarcely audibly, beckoning to him with his<br/>finger.<br/><br/>"No, she's not here, you old lunatic!" Ivan shouted at him<br/>angrily. "Here, he's fainting? Water! A towel! Make haste,<br/>Smerdyakov!"<br/><br/>Smerdyakov ran for water. At last they got the old man<br/>undressed, and put him to bed. They wrapped a wet towel round his<br/>head. Exhausted by the brandy, by his violent emotion, and the<br/>blows he had received, he shut his eyes and fell asleep as soon as<br/>his head touched the pillow. Ivan and Alyosha went back to the<br/>drawing-room. Smerdyakov removed the fragments of the broken vase,<br/>while Grigory stood by the table looking gloomily at the floor.<br/>
