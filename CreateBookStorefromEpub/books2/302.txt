"Andrey! What if they're asleep?"

This thought fell upon him like a blow. It had not occurred to
him before.

"It may well be that they're gone to bed by now, Dmitri
Fyodorovitch."

Mitya frowned as though in pain. Yes, indeed… he was rushing
there… with such feelings… while they were asleep… she was asleep,
perhaps, there too… . An angry feeling surged up in his heart.

"Drive on, Andrey! Whip them up! Look alive!" he cried, beside
himself.

"But maybe they're not in bed!" Andrey went on after a pause.
"Timofey said they were a lot of them there-."

"At the station?"

"Not at the posting-station, but at Plastunov's, at the inn,
where they let out horses, too."

"I know. So you say there are a lot of them? How's that? Who are
they?" cried Mitya, greatly dismayed at this unexpected news.

"Well, Timofey was saying they're all gentlefolk. Two from our
town- who they are I can't say- and there are two others,
strangers, maybe more besides. I didn't ask particularly. They've
set to playing cards, so Timofey said."
