If but my dear one be in health?<br/><br/>Lord have mercy<br/><br/>On her and on me!<br/><br/>On her and on me!<br/><br/>On her and on me!<br/><br/>"It was even better last time," observed the woman's voice. "You<br/>sang 'If my darling be in health'; it sounded more tender. I<br/>suppose you've forgotten to-day."<br/><br/>"Poetry is rubbish!" said Smerdyakov curtly.<br/><br/>"Oh, no! I am very fond of poetry."<br/><br/>"So far as it's poetry, it's essential rubbish. Consider<br/>yourself, who ever talks in rhyme? And if we were all to talk in<br/>rhyme, even though it were decreed by government, we shouldn't say<br/>much, should we? Poetry is no good, Marya Kondratyevna."<br/><br/>"How clever you are! How is it you've gone so deep into<br/>everything?" The woman's voice was more and more insinuating.<br/><br/>"I could have done better than that. I could have known more<br/>than that, if it had not been for my destiny from my childhood up.<br/>I would have shot a man in a duel if he called me names because I<br/>am descended from a filthy beggar and have no father. And they used<br/>to throw it in my teeth in Moscow. It had reached them from here,<br/>thanks to Grigory Vassilyevitch. Grigory Vassilyevitch blames me<br/>for rebelling against my birth, but I would have sanctioned their<br/>killing me before I was born that I might not have come into the<br/>world at all. They used to say in the market, and your mamma too,<br/>with great lack of delicacy, set off telling me that her hair was<br/>like a mat on her head, and that she was short of five foot by a<br/>wee bit. Why talk of a wee bit while she might have said 'a little<br/>bit,' like everyone else? She wanted to make it touching, a regular<br/>peasant's feeling. Can a Russian peasant be said to feel, in<br/>comparison with an educated man? He can't be said to have feeling<br/>at all, in his ignorance. From my childhood up when I hear 'a wee<br/>bit,' I am ready to burst with rage. I hate all Russia, Marya<br/>Kondratyevna."<br/>
