"Nothing will make him get up, nothing!" Kolya cried
triumphantly, proud of his success. "He won't move for all the
shouting in the world, but if I call to him, he'll jump up in a
minute. Ici, Perezvon!" The dog leapt up and bounded about, whining
with delight. The captain ran back with a piece of cooked beef.

"Is it hot?" Kolya inquired hurriedly, with a business-like air,
taking the meat. "Dogs don't like hot things. No, it's all right.
Look, everybody, look, Ilusha, look, old man; why aren't you
looking? He does not look at him, now I've brought him."

The new trick consisted in making the dog stand motionless with
his nose out and putting a tempting morsel of meat just on his
nose. The luckless dog had to stand without moving, with the meat
on his nose, as long as his master chose to keep him, without a
movement, perhaps for half an hour. But he kept Perezvon only for a
brief moment.

"Paid for!" cried Kolya, and the meat passed in a flash from the
dog's nose to his mouth. The audience, of course, expressed
enthusiasm and surprise.

"Can you really have put off coming all this time simply to
train the dog?" exclaimed Alyosha, with an involuntary note of
reproach in his voice.

"Simply for that!" answered Kolya, with perfect simplicity. "I
wanted to show him in all his glory."

"Perezvon! Perezvon," called Ilusha suddenly, snapping his thin
fingers and beckoning to the dog.

"What is it? Let him jump up on the bed! Ici, Perezvon!" Kolya
slapped the bed and Perezvon darted up by Ilusha. The boy threw
both arms round his head and Perezvon instantly licked his cheek.
Ilusha crept close to him, stretched himself out in bed and hid his
face in the dog's shaggy coat.

"Dear, dear!" kept exclaiming the captain. Kolya sat down again
on the edge of the bed.

"Ilusha, I can show you another trick. I've brought you a little
cannon. You remember, I told you about it before and you said how
much you'd like to see it. Well, here, I've brought it to you."
