"That is certainly wonderful, madam," observed Mitya, sitting<br/>down limply, "but I have come to you on a matter of great<br/>importance… . On a matter of supreme importance for me, that is,<br/>madam… for me alone… and I hasten- "<br/><br/>"I know you've come on most important business. Dmitri<br/>Fyodorovitch; it's not a case of presentiment, no reactionary<br/>harking back to the miraculous (have you heard about Father<br/>Zossima?). This is a case of mathematics: you couldn't help coming,<br/>after all that has passed with Katerina Ivanovna; you couldn't, you<br/>couldn't, that's a mathematical certainty."<br/><br/>"The realism of actual life, madam, that's what it is. But allow<br/>me to explain-"<br/><br/>"Realism indeed, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. I'm all for realism now.<br/>I've seen too much of miracles. You've heard that Father Zossima is<br/>dead?"<br/><br/>"No, madam, it's the first time I've heard of it." Mitya was a<br/>little surprised. The image of Alyosha rose to his mind.<br/><br/>"Last night, and only imagine-"<br/><br/>"Madam," said Mitya, "I can imagine nothing except that I'm in a<br/>desperate position, and that if you don't help me, everything will<br/>come to grief, and I first of all. Excuse me for the triviality of<br/>the expression, but I'm in a fever-"<br/><br/>"I know, I know that you're in a fever. You could hardly fail to<br/>be, and whatever you may say to me, I know beforehand. I have long<br/>been thinking over your destiny, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, I am watching<br/>over it and studying it… . Oh, believe me, I'm an experienced<br/>doctor of the soul, Dmitri Fyodorovitch."<br/><br/>"Madam, if you are an experienced doctor, I'm certainly an<br/>experienced patient," said Mitya, with an effort to be polite, "and<br/>I feel that if you are watching over my destiny in this way, you<br/>will come to my help in my ruin, and so allow me, at least to<br/>explain to you the plan with which I have ventured to come to you…<br/>and what I am hoping of you… . I have come, madam-"<br/><br/>"Don't explain it. It's of secondary importance. But as for<br/>help, you're not the first I have helped, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. You<br/>have most likely heard of my cousin, Madame Belmesov. Her husband<br/>was ruined, 'had come to grief,' as you characteristically express<br/>it, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. I recommended him to take to<br/>horse-breeding, and now he's doing well. Have you any idea of<br/>horse-breeding, Dmitri Fyodorovitch?"<br/><br/>"Not the faintest, madam; ah, madam, not the faintest!" cried<br/>Mitya, in nervous impatience, positively starting from his seat. "I<br/>simply implore you, madam, to listen to me. Only give me two<br/>minutes of free speech that I may just explain to you everything,<br/>the whole plan with which I have come. Besides, I am short of time.<br/>I'm in a fearful hurry," Mitya cried hysterically, feeling that she<br/>was just going to begin talking again, and hoping to cut her short.<br/>"I have come in despair… in the last gasp of despair, to beg you to<br/>lend me the sum of three thousand, a loan, but on safe, most safe<br/>security, madam, with the most trustworthy guarantees! Only let me<br/>explain-"<br/>
