"Yes, about money, too."<br/><br/>"There was a dispute about three thousand roubles, I think,<br/>which you claimed as part of your inheritance?"<br/><br/>"Three thousand! More, more," cried Mitya hotly; "more than six<br/>thousand, more than ten, perhaps. I told everyone so, shouted it at<br/>them. But I made up my mind to let it go at three thousand. I was<br/>desperately in need of that three thousand… so the bundle of notes<br/>for three thousand that I knew he kept under his pillow, ready for<br/>Grushenka, I considered as simply stolen from me. Yes, gentlemen, I<br/>looked upon it as mine, as my own property… "<br/><br/>The prosecutor looked significantly at the investigating lawyer,<br/>and had time to wink at him on the sly.<br/><br/>"We will return to that subject later," said the lawyer<br/>promptly. "You will allow us to note that point and write it down;<br/>that you looked upon that money as your own property?"<br/><br/>"Write it down, by all means. I know that's another fact that<br/>tells against me, but I'm not afraid of facts and I tell them<br/>against myself. Do you hear? Do you know, gentlemen, you take me<br/>for a different sort of man from what I am," he added, suddenly<br/>gloomy and dejected. "You have to deal with a man of honour, a man<br/>of the highest honour; above all don't lose sight of it- a man<br/>who's done a lot of nasty things, but has always been, and still<br/>is, honourable at bottom, in his inner being. I don't know how to<br/>express it. That's just what's made me wretched all my life, that I<br/>yearned to be honourable, that I was, so to say, a martyr to a<br/>sense of honour, seeking for it with a lantern, with the lantern of<br/>Diogenes, and yet all my life I've been doing filthy things like<br/>all of us, gentlemen… that is like me alone. That was a mistake,<br/>like me alone, me alone!… Gentlemen, my head aches… " His brows<br/>contracted with pain. "You see, gentlemen, I couldn't bear the look<br/>of him, there was something in him ignoble, impudent, trampling on<br/>everything sacred, something sneering and irreverent, loathsome,<br/>loathsome. But now that he's dead, I feel differently."<br/><br/>"How do you mean?"<br/><br/>"I don't feel differently, but I wish I hadn't hated him<br/>so."<br/><br/>"You feel penitent?"<br/><br/>"No, not penitent, don't write that. I'm not much good myself;<br/>I'm not very beautiful, so I had no right to consider him<br/>repulsive. That's what I mean. Write that down, if you like."<br/><br/>Saying this Mitya became very mournful. He had grown more and<br/>more gloomy as the inquiry continued.<br/>
