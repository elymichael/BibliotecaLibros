"No, no, no!" Ivan cried suddenly. "It was not a dream. He was<br/>here; he was sitting here, on that sofa. When you knocked at the<br/>window, I threw a glass at him… this one. Wait a minute. I was<br/>asleep last time, but this dream was not a dream. It has happened<br/>before. I have dreams now, Alyosha… yet they are not dreams, but<br/>reality. I walk about, talk and see… though I am asleep. But he was<br/>sitting here, on that sofa there… . He is frightfully stupid,<br/>Alyosha, frightfully stupid." Ivan laughed suddenly and began<br/>pacing about the room.<br/><br/>"Who is stupid? Of whom are you talking, brother?" Alyosha asked<br/>anxiously again.<br/><br/>"The devil! He's taken to visiting me. He's been here twice,<br/>almost three times. He taunted me with being angry at his being a<br/>simple devil and not Satan, with scorched wings, in thunder and<br/>lightning. But he is not Satan: that's a lie. He is an impostor. He<br/>is simply a devil- a paltry, trivial devil. He goes to the baths.<br/>If you undressed him, you'd be sure to find he had a tail, long and<br/>smooth like a Danish dog's, a yard long, dun colour… . Alyosha, you<br/>are cold. You've been in the snow. Would you like some tea? What?<br/>Is it cold? Shall I tell her to bring some? C'est a ne pas mettre<br/>un chien dehors… "<br/><br/>Alyosha ran to the washing-stand, wetted the towel, persuaded<br/>Ivan to sit down again, and put the wet towel round his head. He<br/>sat down beside him.<br/><br/>"What were you telling me just now about Lise?" Ivan began<br/>again. (He was becoming very talkative.) "I like Lise. I said<br/>something nasty about her. It was a lie. I like her… I am afraid<br/>for Katya to-morrow. I am more afraid of her than of anything. On<br/>account of the future. She will cast me off to-morrow and trample<br/>me under foot. She thinks that I am ruining Mitya from jealousy on<br/>her account! Yes, she thinks that! But it's not so. To-morrow the<br/>cross, but not the gallows. No, I shan't hang myself. Do you know,<br/>I can never commit suicide, Alyosha. Is it because I am base? I am<br/>not a coward. Is it from love of life? How did I know that<br/>Smerdyakov had hanged himself? Yes, it was he told me so."<br/><br/>"And you are quite convinced that there has been someone here?"<br/>asked Alyosha.<br/><br/>"Yes, on that sofa in the corner. You would have driven him<br/>away. You did drive him away: he disappeared when you arrived. I<br/>love your face, Alyosha. Did you know that I loved your face? And<br/>he is myself, Alyosha. All that's base in me, all that's mean and<br/>contemptible. Yes, I am a romantic. He guessed it… though it's a<br/>libel. He is frightfully stupid; but it's to his advantage. He has<br/>cunning, animal cunning- he knew how to infuriate me. He kept<br/>taunting me with believing in him, and that was how he made me<br/>listen to him. He fooled me like a boy. He told me a great deal<br/>that was true about myself, though. I should never have owned it to<br/>myself. Do you know, Alyosha," Ivan added in an intensely earnest<br/>and confidential tone, "I should be awfully glad to think that it<br/>was he and not I."<br/><br/>"He has worn you out," said Alyosha, looking compassionately at<br/>his brother.<br/><br/>"He's been teasing me. And you know he does it so cleverly, so<br/>cleverly. 'Conscience! What is conscience? I make it up for myself.<br/>Why am I tormented by it? From habit. From the universal habit of<br/>mankind for the seven thousand years. So let us give it up, and we<br/>shall be gods.' It was he said that, it was he said that!"<br/><br/>"And not you, not you?" Alyosha could not help crying, looking<br/>frankly at his brother. "Never mind him, anyway; have done with him<br/>and forget him. And let him take with him all that you curse now,<br/>and never come back!"<br/><br/>"Yes, but he is spiteful. He laughed at me. He was impudent,<br/>Alyosha," Ivan said, with a shudder of offence. "But he was unfair<br/>to me, unfair to me about lots of things. He told lies about me to<br/>my face. 'Oh, you are going to perform an act of heroic virtue: to<br/>confess you murdered your father, that the valet murdered him at<br/>your instigation.'"<br/>
