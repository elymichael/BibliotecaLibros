<br/>At the hospital he was at once allowed to see the patient.<br/>Smerdyakov was lying on a truckle-bed in a separate ward. There was<br/>only one other bed in the room, and in it lay a tradesman of the<br/>town, swollen with dropsy, who was obviously almost dying; he could<br/>be no hindrance to their conversation. Smerdyakov grinned<br/>uncertainly on seeing Ivan, and for the first instant seemed<br/>nervous. So at least Ivan fancied. But that was only momentary. For<br/>the rest of the time he was struck, on the contrary, by<br/>Smerdyakov's composure. From the first glance Ivan had no doubt<br/>that he was very ill. He was very weak; he spoke slowly, seeming to<br/>move his tongue with difficulty; he was much thinner and<br/>sallower.Throughout the interview, which lasted twenty minutes, he<br/>kept complaining of headache and of pain in all his limbs. His thin<br/>emasculate face seemed to have become so tiny; his hair was<br/>ruffled, and his crest of curls in front stood up in a thin tuft.<br/>But in the left eye, which was screwed up and seemed to be<br/>insinuating something, Smerdyakov showed himself unchanged. "It's<br/>always worth while speaking to a clever man." Ivan was reminded of<br/>that at once. He sat down on the stool at his feet. Smerdyakov,<br/>with painful effort, shifted his position in bed, but he was not<br/>the first to speak. He remained dumb, and did not even look much<br/>interested.<br/><br/>"Can you. talk to me?" asked Ivan. "I won't tire you much."<br/><br/>"Certainly I can," mumbled Smerdyakov, in a faint voice. "Has<br/>your honour been back long?" he added patronisingly, as though<br/>encouraging a nervous visitor.<br/><br/>"I only arrived to-dayâ€¦ . To see the mess you are in here."<br/><br/>Smerdyakov sighed.<br/><br/>"Why do you sigh? You knew of it all along," Ivan blurted<br/>out.<br/><br/>Smerdyakov was stolidly silent for a while.<br/><br/>"How could I help knowing? It was clear beforehand. But how<br/>could I tell it would turn out like that?"<br/><br/>"What would turn out? Don't prevaricate! You've foretold you'd<br/>have a fit; on the way down to the cellar, you know. You mentioned<br/>the very spot."<br/><br/>"Have you said so at the examination yet?" Smerdyakov queried<br/>with composure.<br/><br/>
