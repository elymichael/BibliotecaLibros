Not You, Not You!


ON the way to Ivan he had to pass the house where Katerina
Ivanovna was living. There was light in the windows. He suddenly
stopped and resolved to go in. He had not seen Katerina Ivanovna
for more than a week. But now it struck him that Ivan might be with
her, especially on the eve of the terrible day. Ringing, and
mounting the staircase, which was dimly lighted by a Chinese
lantern, he saw a man coming down, and as they met, he recognised
him as his brother. So he was just coming from Katerina
Ivanovna.

"Ah, it's only you," said Ivan dryly. "Well, good-bye! You are
going to her?"

"Yes."

"I don't advise you to; she's upset and you'll upset her
more."

A door was instantly flung open above, and a voice cried
suddenly:

"No, no! Alexey Fyodorovitch, have you come from him?"

"Yes, I have been with him."
