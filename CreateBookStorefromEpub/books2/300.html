They began a third game, and by degrees the talk about Mitya<br/>died away. But by the end of the third game, Pyotr Ilyitch felt no<br/>more desire for billiards; he laid down the cue, and without having<br/>supper as he had intended, he walked out of the tavern. When he<br/>reached the market-place he stood still in perplexity, wondering at<br/>himself. He realised that what he wanted was to go to Fyodor<br/>Pavlovitch's and find out if anything had happened there. "On<br/>account of some stupid nonsense as it's sure to turn out- am I<br/>going to wake up the household and make a scandal? Fooh! damn it,<br/>is it my business to look after them?"<br/><br/>In a very bad humour he went straight home, and suddenly<br/>remembered Fenya. "Damn it all! I ought to have questioned her just<br/>now," he thought with vexation, "I should have heard everything."<br/>And the desire to speak to her, and so find out, became so pressing<br/>and importunate that when he was halfway home he turned abruptly<br/>and went towards the house where Grushenka lodged. Going up to the<br/>gate he knocked. The sound of the knock in the silence of the night<br/>sobered him and made him feel annoyed. And no one answered him;<br/>everyone in the house was asleep.<br/><br/>"And I shall be making a fuss!" he thought, with a feeling of<br/>positive discomfort. But instead of going away altogether, he fell<br/>to knocking again with all his might, filling the street with<br/>clamour.<br/><br/>"Not coming? Well, I will knock them up, I will!" he muttered at<br/>each knock, fuming at himself, but at the same time he redoubled<br/>his knocks on the gate.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
