And, of course, this brief episode did him no good with the jury<br/>or the public. His character was displayed, and it spoke for<br/>itself. It was under the influence of this incident that the<br/>opening statement was read. It was rather short, but<br/>circumstantial. It only stated the chief reasons why he had been<br/>arrested, why he must be tried, and so on. Yet it made a great<br/>impression on me. The clerk read it loudly and distinctly. The<br/>whole tragedy was suddenly unfolded before us, concentrated, in<br/>bold relief, in a fatal and pitiless light. I remember how,<br/>immediately after it had been read, the President asked Mitya in a<br/>loud impressive voice:<br/><br/>"Prisoner, do you plead guilty?"<br/><br/>Mitya suddenly rose from his seat.<br/><br/>"I plead guilty to drunkenness and dissipation," he exclaimed,<br/>again in a startling, almost frenzied, voice, "to idleness and<br/>debauchery. I meant to become an honest man for good, just at the<br/>moment when I was struck down by fate. But I am not guilty of the<br/>death of that old man, my enemy and my father. No, no, I am not<br/>guilty of robbing him! I could not be. Dmitri Karamazov is a<br/>scoundrel, but not a thief."<br/><br/>He sat down again, visibly trembling all over. The President<br/>again briefly, but impressively, admonished him to answer only what<br/>was asked, and not to go off into irrelevant exclamations. Then he<br/>ordered the case to proceed. All the witnesses were led up to take<br/>the oath. Then I saw them all together. The brothers of the<br/>prisoner were, however, allowed to give evidence without taking the<br/>oath. After an exhortation from the priest and the President, the<br/>witnesses were led away and were made to sit as far as possible<br/>apart from one another. Then they began calling them up one by<br/>one.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
