<br/>"Andrey! What if they're asleep?"<br/><br/>This thought fell upon him like a blow. It had not occurred to<br/>him before.<br/><br/>"It may well be that they're gone to bed by now, Dmitri<br/>Fyodorovitch."<br/><br/>Mitya frowned as though in pain. Yes, indeed… he was rushing<br/>there… with such feelings… while they were asleep… she was asleep,<br/>perhaps, there too… . An angry feeling surged up in his heart.<br/><br/>"Drive on, Andrey! Whip them up! Look alive!" he cried, beside<br/>himself.<br/><br/>"But maybe they're not in bed!" Andrey went on after a pause.<br/>"Timofey said they were a lot of them there-."<br/><br/>"At the station?"<br/><br/>"Not at the posting-station, but at Plastunov's, at the inn,<br/>where they let out horses, too."<br/><br/>"I know. So you say there are a lot of them? How's that? Who are<br/>they?" cried Mitya, greatly dismayed at this unexpected news.<br/><br/>"Well, Timofey was saying they're all gentlefolk. Two from our<br/>town- who they are I can't say- and there are two others,<br/>strangers, maybe more besides. I didn't ask particularly. They've<br/>set to playing cards, so Timofey said."<br/><br/>
