"How do you mean, offering herself?" exclaimed Alyosha.<br/><br/>"As wanton women offer themselves, to be sure."<br/><br/>"How can you, Ivan, how can you?" Alyosha cried warmly, in a<br/>grieved voice. "She is a child; you are insulting a child! She is<br/>ill; she is very ill, too. She is on the verge of insanity, too,<br/>perhaps… . I had hoped to hear something from you… that would save<br/>her."<br/><br/>"You'll hear nothing from me. If she is a child, I am not her<br/>nurse. Be quiet, Alexey. Don't go on about her. I am not even<br/>thinking about it."<br/><br/>They were silent again for a moment.<br/><br/>"She will be praying all night now to the Mother of God to show<br/>her how to act to-morrow at the trial," he said sharply and angrily<br/>again.<br/><br/>"You… you mean Katerina Ivanovna?"<br/><br/>"Yes. Whether she's to save Mitya or ruin him. She'll pray for<br/>light from above. She can't make up her mind for herself, you see.<br/>She has not had time to decide yet. She takes me for her nurse,<br/>too. She wants me to sing lullabies to her."<br/><br/>"Katerina Ivanovna loves you, brother," said Alyosha sadly.<br/><br/>"Perhaps; but I am not very keen on her."<br/><br/>"She is suffering. Why do you… sometimes say things to her that<br/>give her hope?" Alyosha went on, with timid reproach. "I know that<br/>you've given her hope. Forgive me for speaking to you like this,"<br/>he added.<br/>
