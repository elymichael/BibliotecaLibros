<br/>"But here is one from afar." He pointed to a woman by no means<br/>old but very thin and wasted, with a face not merely sunburnt but<br/>almost blackened by exposure. She was kneeling and gazing with a<br/>fixed stare at the elder; there was something almost frenzied in<br/>her eyes.<br/><br/>"From afar off, Father, from afar off! From two hundred miles<br/>from here. From afar off, Father, from afar off!" the woman began<br/>in a sing-song voice as though she were chanting a dirge, swaying<br/>her head from side to side with her cheek resting in her hand.<br/><br/>There is silent and long-suffering sorrow to be met with among<br/>the peasantry. It withdraws into itself and is still. But there is<br/>a grief that breaks out, and from that minute it bursts into tears<br/>and finds vent in wailing. This is particularly common with women.<br/>But it is no lighter a grief than the silent. Lamentations comfort<br/>only by lacerating the heart still more. Such grief does not desire<br/>consolation. It feeds on the sense of its hopelessness.<br/>Lamentations spring only from the constant craving to re-open the<br/>wound.<br/><br/>"You are of the tradesman class?" said Father Zossima, looking<br/>curiously at her.<br/><br/>"Townfolk we are, Father, townfolk. Yet we are peasants though<br/>we live in the town. I have come to see you, O Father! We heard of<br/>you, Father, we heard of you. I have buried my little son, and I<br/>have come on a pilgrimage. I have been in three monasteries, but<br/>they told me, 'Go, Nastasya, go to them'- that is to you. I have<br/>come; I was yesterday at the service, and to-day I have come to<br/>you."<br/><br/>"What are you weeping for?"<br/><br/>"It's my little son I'm grieving for, Father. he was three years<br/>old- three years all but three months. For my little boy, Father,<br/>I'm in anguish, for my little boy. He was the last one left. We had<br/>four, my Nikita and I, and now we've no children, our dear ones<br/>have all gone I buried the first three without grieving overmuch,<br/>and now I have buried the last I can't forget him. He seems always<br/>standing before me. He never leaves me. He has withered my heart. I<br/>look at his little clothes, his little shirt, his little boots, and<br/>I wail. I lay out all that is left of him, all his little things. I<br/>look at them and wail. I say to Nikita, my husband, 'let me go on a<br/>pilgrimage, master.' He is a driver. We're not poor people, Father,<br/>not poor; he drives our own horse. It's all our own, the horse and<br/>the carriage. And what good is it all to us now? My Nikita has<br/>begun drinking while I am away. He's sure to. It used to be so<br/>before. As soon as I turn my back he gives way to it. But now I<br/>don't think about him. It's three months since I left home. I've<br/>forgotten him. I've forgotten everything. I don't want to remember.<br/>And what would our life be now together? I've done with him, I've<br/>done. I've done with them all. I don't care to look upon my house<br/>and my goods. I don't care to see anything at all!"<br/><br/>"Listen, mother," said the elder. "Once in olden times a holy<br/>saint saw in the Temple a mother like you weeping for her little<br/>one, her only one, whom God had taken. 'Knowest thou not,' said the<br/>saint to her, 'how bold these little ones are before the throne of<br/>God? Verily there are none bolder than they in the Kingdom of<br/>Heaven. "Thou didst give us life, O Lord," they say, "and scarcely<br/>had we looked upon it when Thou didst take it back again." And so<br/>boldly they ask and ask again that God gives them at once the rank<br/>of angels. Therefore,' said the saint, 'thou, too, O Mother,<br/>rejoice and weep not, for thy little son is with the Lord in the<br/>fellowship of the angels.' That's what the saint said to the<br/>weeping mother of old. He was a great saint and he could not have<br/>spoken falsely. Therefore you too, mother, know that your little<br/>one is surely before the throne of God, is rejoicing and happy, and<br/>praying to God for you, and therefore weep, but rejoice."<br/><br/>The woman listened to him, looking down with her cheek in her<br/>hand. She sighed deeply.<br/><br/>"My Nikita tried to comfort me with the same words as you.<br/>'Foolish one,' he said, 'why weep? Our son is no doubt singing with<br/>the angels before God.' He says that to me, but he weeps himself. I<br/>see that he cries like me. 'I know, Nikita,' said I. 'Where could<br/>he be if not with the Lord God? Only, here with us now he is not as<br/>he used to sit beside us before.' And if only I could look upon him<br/>one little time, if only I could peep at him one little time,<br/>without going up to him, without speaking, if I could be hidden in<br/>a corner and only see him for one little minute, hear him playing<br/>in the yard, calling in his little voice, 'Mammy, where are you?'<br/>If only I could hear him pattering with his little feet about the<br/>room just once, only once; for so often, so often I remember how he<br/>used to run to me and shout and laugh, if only I could hear his<br/>little feet I should know him! But he's gone, Father, he's gone,<br/>and I shall never hear him again. Here's his little sash, but him I<br/>shall never see or hear now."<br/><br/>
