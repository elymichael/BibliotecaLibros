"What do you mean? How can you? Why?" cried Alyosha
surprised.

"Oh, if I, too, could sacrifice myself some day for truth!" said
Kolya with enthusiasm.

"But not in such a cause, not with such disgrace and such
horrer!" said Alyosha.

"Of courseâ€¦ I should like to die for all humanity, and as for
disgrace, I don't care about that- our names may perish. I respect
your brother!"

"And so do I!" the boy, who had once declared that he knew who
had founded Troy, cried suddenly and unexpectedly, and he blushed
up to his ears like a peony as he had done on that occasion.

Alyosha went into the room. Ilusha lay with his hands folded and
his eyes closed in a blue coffin with a white frill round it. His
thin face was hardly changed at all, and strange to say there was
no smell of decay from the corpse. The expression of his face was
serious and, as it were, thoughtful. His hands, crossed over his
breast, looked particularly beautiful, as though chiselled in
marble. There were flowers in his hands and the coffin, with
flowers, which had been sent early in the morning by Lise Hohlakov.
But there were flowers too from Katerina Ivanovna, and when Alyosha
opened the door, the captain had a bunch in his trembling hands and
was strewing them again over his dear boy. He scarcely glanced at
Alyosha when he came in, and he would not look at anyone, even at
his crazy weeping wife, "mamma," who kept trying to stand on her
crippled legs to get a nearer look at her dead boy. Nina had been
pushed in her chair by the boys close up to the coffin. She sat
with her head pressed to it and she too was no doubt quietly
weeping. Snegiryov's face looked eager, yet bewildered and
exasperated. There was something crazy about his gestures and the
words that broke from him. "Old man, dear old man!" he exclaimed
every minute, gazing at Ilusha. It was his habit to call Ilusha
"old man," as a term of affection when he was alive.

"Father, give me a flower, too; take that white one out of his
hand and give it me," the crazy mother begged, whimpering. Either
because the little white rose in Ilusha's hand had caught her fancy
or that she wanted one from his hand to keep in memory of him, she
moved restlessly, stretching out her hands for the flower.

"I won't give it to anyone, I won't give you anything,"
Snegiryov cried callously. "They are his flowers, not yours!
Everything is his, nothing is yours!"

"Father, give mother a flower!" said Nina, lifting her face wet
with tears.

"I won't give away anything and to her less than anyone! She
didn't love Ilusha. She took away his little cannon and he gave it
to her," the captain broke into loud sobs at the thought of how
Ilusha had given up his cannon to his mother. The poor, crazy
creature was bathed in noiseless tears, hiding her face in her
hands.
