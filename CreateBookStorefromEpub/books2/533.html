<br/>As for the President of our Court, I can only say that he was a<br/>humane and cultured man, who had a practical knowledge of his work<br/>and progressive views. He was rather ambitious, but did not concern<br/>himself greatly about his future career. The great aim of his life<br/>was to be a man of advanced ideas. He was, too, a man of<br/>connections and property. He felt, as we learnt afterwards, rather<br/>strongly about the Karamazov case, but from a social, not from a<br/>personal standpoint. He was interested in it as a social<br/>phenomenon, in its classification and its character as a product of<br/>our social conditions, as typical of the national character, and so<br/>on, and so on. His attitude to the personal aspect of the case, to<br/>its tragic significance and the persons involved in it, including<br/>the prisoner, was rather indifferent and abstract, as was perhaps<br/>fitting, indeed.<br/><br/>The court was packed and overflowing long before the judges made<br/>their appearance. Our court is the best hall in the town- spacious,<br/>lofty, and good for sound. On the right of the judges, who were on<br/>a raised platform, a table and two rows of chairs had been put<br/>ready for the jury. On the left was the place for the prisoner and<br/>the counsel for the defence. In the middle of the court, near the<br/>judges, was a table with the "material proofs." On it lay Fyodor<br/>Pavlovitch's white silk dressing-gown, stained with blood; the<br/>fatal brass pestle with which the supposed murder had been<br/>committed; Mitya's shirt, with a blood-stained sleeve; his coat,<br/>stained with blood in patches over the pocket in which he had put<br/>his handkerchief; the handkerchief itself, stiff with blood and by<br/>now quite yellow; the pistol loaded by Mitya at Perhotin's with a<br/>view to suicide, and taken from him on the sly at Mokroe by Trifon<br/>Borrissovitch; the envelope in which the three thousand roubles had<br/>been put ready for Grushenka, the narrow pink ribbon with which it<br/>had been tied, and many other articles I don't remember. In the<br/>body of the hall, at some distance, came the seats for the public.<br/>But in front of the balustrade a few chairs had been placed for<br/>witnesses who remained in the court after giving their<br/>evidence.<br/><br/>At ten o'clock the three judges arrived- the President, one<br/>honorary justice of the peace, and one other. The prosecutor, of<br/>course, entered immediately after. The President was a short,<br/>stout, thick-set man of fifty, with a dyspeptic complexion, dark<br/>hair turning grey and cut short, and a red ribbon, of what Order I<br/>don't remember. The prosecutor struck me and the others, too, as<br/>looking particularly pale, almost green. His face seemed to have<br/>grown suddenly thinner, perhaps in a single night, for I had seen<br/>him looking as usual only two days before. The President began with<br/>asking the court whether all the jury were present.<br/><br/>But I see I can't go on like this, partly because some things I<br/>did not hear, others I did not notice, and others I have forgotten,<br/>but most of all because, as I have said before, I have literally no<br/>time or space to mention everything that was said and done. I only<br/>know that neither side objected to very many of the jurymen. I<br/>remember the twelve jurymen- four were petty officials of the town,<br/>two were merchants, and six peasants and artisans of the town. I<br/>remember, long before the trial, questions were continually asked<br/>with some surprise, especially by ladies: "Can such a delicate,<br/>complex and psychological case be submitted for decision to petty<br/>officials and even peasants?" and "What can an official, still more<br/>a peasant, understand in such an affair?" All the four officials in<br/>the jury were, in fact, men of no consequence and of low rank.<br/>Except one who was rather younger, they were grey-headed men,<br/>little known in society, who had vegetated on a pitiful salary, and<br/>who probably had elderly, unpresentable wives and crowds of<br/>children, perhaps even without shoes and stockings. At most, they<br/>spent their leisure over cards and, of course, had never read a<br/>single book. The two merchants looked respectable, but were<br/>strangely silent and stolid. One of them was close-shaven, and was<br/>dressed in European style; the other had a small, grey beard, and<br/>wore a red ribbon with some sort of a medal upon it on his neck.<br/>There is no need to speak of the artisans and the peasants. The<br/>artisans of Skotoprigonyevsk are almost peasants, and even work on<br/>the land. Two of them also wore European dress, and, perhaps for<br/>that reason, were dirtier and more uninviting-looking than the<br/>others. So that one might well wonder, as I did as soon as I had<br/>looked at them, "what men like that could possibly make of such a<br/>case?" Yet their faces made a strangely imposing, almost menacing,<br/>impression; they were stern and frowning.<br/><br/>At last the President opened the case of the murder of Fyodor<br/>Pavlovitch Karamazov. I don't quite remember how he described him.<br/>The court usher was told to bring in the prisoner, and Mitya made<br/>his appearance. There was a hush through the court. One could have<br/>heard a fly. I don't know how it was with others, but Mitya made a<br/>most unfavourable impression on me. He looked an awful dandy in a<br/>brand-new frock-coat. I heard afterwards that he had ordered it in<br/>Moscow expressly for the occasion from his own tailor, who had his<br/>measure. He wore immaculate black kid gloves and exquisite linen.<br/>He walked in with his yard-long strides, looking stiffly straight<br/>in front of him, and sat down in his place with a most unperturbed<br/>air.<br/><br/>At the same moment the counsel for defence, the celebrated<br/>Fetyukovitch, entered, and a sort of subdued hum passed through the<br/>court. He was a tall, spare man, with long thin legs, with<br/>extremely long, thin, pale fingers, clean-shaven face, demurely<br/>brushed, rather short hair, and thin lips that were at times curved<br/>into something between a sneer and a smile. He looked about forty.<br/>His face would have been pleasant, if it had not been for his eyes,<br/>which, in themselves small and inexpressive, were set remarkably<br/>close together, with only the thin, long nose as a dividing line<br/>between them. In fact, there was something strikingly birdlike<br/>about his face. He was in evening dress and white tie.<br/><br/>I remember the President's first questions to Mitya, about his<br/>name, his calling, and so on. Mitya answered sharply, and his voice<br/>was so unexpectedly loud that it made the President start and look<br/>at the prisoner with surprise. Then followed a list of persons who<br/>were to take part in the proceedings- that is, of the witnesses and<br/>experts. It was a long list. Four of the witnesses were not<br/>present- Miusov, who had given evidence at the preliminary inquiry,<br/>but was now in Paris; Madame Hohlakov and Maximov, who were absent<br/>through illness; and Smerdyakov, through his sudden death, of which<br/>an official statement from the police was presented. The news of<br/>Smerdyakov's death produced a sudden stir and whisper in the court.<br/>Many of the audience, of course, had not heard of the sudden<br/>suicide. What struck people most was Mitya's sudden outburst. As<br/>soon as the statement of Smerdyakov's death was made, he cried out<br/>aloud from his place:<br/><br/>"He was a dog and died like a dog!"<br/><br/>I remember how his counsel rushed to him, and how the President<br/>addressed him, threatening to take stern measures, if such an<br/>irregularity were repeated. Mitya nodded and in a subdued voice<br/>repeated several times abruptly to his counsel, with no show of<br/>regret:<br/><br/>"I won't again, I won't. It escaped me. I won't do it<br/>again."<br/><br/>
