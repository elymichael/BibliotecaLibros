<br/>They were awaiting Mitya with impatience in the shop. They had<br/>vivid recollections of how he had bought, three or four weeks ago,<br/>wine and goods of all sorts to the value of several hundred<br/>roubles, paid for in cash (they would never have let him have<br/>anything on credit, of course). They remembered that then, as now,<br/>he had had a bundle of hundred-rouble notes in his hand, and had<br/>scattered them at random, without bargaining, without reflecting,<br/>or caring to reflect what use so much wine and provisions would be<br/>to him. The story was told all over the town that, driving off then<br/>with Grushenka to Mokroe, he had "spent three thousand in one night<br/>and the following day, and had come back from the spree without a<br/>penny." He had picked up a whole troop of gypsies (encamped in our<br/>neighbourhood at the time), who for two days got money without<br/>stint out of him while he was drunk, and drank expensive wine<br/>without stint. People used to tell, laughing at Mitya, how he had<br/>given champagne to grimy-handed peasants, and feasted the village<br/>women and girls on sweets and Strasburg pies. Though to laugh at<br/>Mitya to his face was rather a risky proceeding, there was much<br/>laughter behind his back, especially in the tavern, at his own<br/>ingenuous public avowal that all he had got out of Grushenka by<br/>this "escapade" was "permission to kiss her foot, and that was the<br/>utmost she had allowed him."<br/><br/>By the time Mitya and Pyotr Ilyitch reached the shop, they found<br/>a cart with three horses harnessed abreast with bells, and with<br/>Andrey, the driver, ready waiting for Mitya at the entrance. In the<br/>shop they had almost entirely finished packing one box of<br/>provisions, and were only waiting for Mitya's arrival to nail it<br/>down and put it in the cart. Pyotr Ilyitch was astounded.<br/><br/>"Where did this cart come from in such a hurry?" he asked<br/>Mitya.<br/><br/>"I met Andrey as I ran to you, and told him to drive straight<br/>here to the shop. There's no time to lose. Last time I drove with<br/>Timofey, but Timofey now has gone on before me with the witch.<br/>Shall we be very late, Andrey?"<br/><br/>"They'll only get there an hour at most before us, not even that<br/>maybe. I got Timofey ready to start. I know how he'll go. Their<br/>pace won't be ours, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. How could it be? They<br/>won't get there an hour earlier!" Andrey, a lanky, red-haired,<br/>middle-aged driver, wearing a full-skirted coat, and with a kaftan<br/>on his arm, replied warmly.<br/><br/>"Fifty roubles for vodka if we're only an hour behind them."<br/><br/>"I warrant the time, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. Ech, they won't be<br/>half an hour before us, let alone an hour."<br/><br/>Though Mitya bustled about seeing after things, he gave his<br/>orders strangely, as it were, disconnectedly, and inconsecutively.<br/>He began a sentence and forgot the end of it. Pyotr Ilyitch found<br/>himself obliged to come to the rescue.<br/><br/>"Four hundred roubles' worth, not less than four hundred<br/>roubles' worth, just as it was then," commanded Mitya. "Four dozen<br/>champagne, not a bottle less."<br/><br/>"What do you want with so much? What's it for? Stay!" cried<br/>Pyotr Ilyitch. "What's this box? What's in it? Surely there isn't<br/>four hundred roubles' worth here?"<br/><br/>
