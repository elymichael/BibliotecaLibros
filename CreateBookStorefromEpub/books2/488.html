<br/>"I can't behave to her as I ought- break off altogether and tell<br/>her so straight out," said Ivan, irritably. "I must wait till<br/>sentence is passed on the murderer. If I break off with her now,<br/>she will avenge herself on me by ruining that scoundrel to-morrow<br/>at the trial, for she hates him and knows she hates him. It's all a<br/>lie- lie upon lie!

There was even a supercilious note in his<br/>voice.<br/><br/>"You know who," Alyosha pronounced in a low, penetrating<br/>voice.<br/><br/>
