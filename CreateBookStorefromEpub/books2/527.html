<br/>"He's slipped away."<br/><br/>Ivan raised his head and smiled softly.<br/><br/>"He was afraid of you, of a dove like you. You are a 'pure<br/>cherub.' Dmitri calls you a cherub. Cherub!… the thunderous rapture<br/>of the seraphim. What are seraphim? Perhaps a whole constellation.<br/>But perhaps that constellation is only a chemical molecule. There's<br/>a constellation of the Lion and the Sun. Don't you know it?"<br/><br/>"Brother, sit down," said Alyosha in alarm. "For goodness' sake,<br/>sit down on the sofa! You are delirious; put your head on the<br/>pillow, that's right. Would you like a wet towel on your head?<br/>Perhaps it will do you good."<br/><br/>"Give me the towel: it's here on the chair. I just threw it down<br/>there."<br/><br/>"It's not here. Don't worry yourself.

I wrapped it round my head and<br/>threw it down here… How is it it's dry? There was no other."<br/><br/>"You put that towel on your head?" asked Alyosha.<br/><br/>"Yes, and walked up and down the room an hour ago… Why have the<br/>candles burnt down so? What's the time?"<br/><br/>"Nearly twelve"<br/><br/>
