<br/>"Hush, Rakitin, you know nothing about us! And don't dare to<br/>speak to me like that again. How dare you be so familiar! Sit in<br/>that corner and be quiet, as though you were my footman! And now,<br/>Alyosha, I'll tell you the whole truth, that you may see what a<br/>wretch I am! I am not talking to Rakitin, but to you. I wanted to<br/>ruin you, Alyosha, that's the holy truth; I quite meant to. I<br/>wanted to so much, that I bribed Rakitin to bring you. And why did<br/>I want to do such a thing? You knew nothing about it, Alyosha, you<br/>turned away from me; if you passed me, you dropped your eyes. And<br/>I've looked at you a hundred times before to-day; I began asking<br/>everyone about you. Your face haunted my heart. 'He despises me,' I<br/>thought; 'he won't even look at me.' And I felt it so much at last<br/>that I wondered at myself for being so frightened of a boy. I'll<br/>get him in my clutches and laugh at him. I was full of spite and<br/>anger. Would you believe it, nobody here dares talk or think of<br/>coming to Agrafena Alexandrovna with any evil purpose. Old Kuzma is<br/>the only man I have anything to do with here; I was bound and sold<br/>to him; Satan brought us together, but there has been no one else.<br/>But looking at you, I thought, I'll get him in my clutches and<br/>laugh at him. You see what a spiteful cur I am, and you called me<br/>your sister! And now that man who wronged me has come; I sit here<br/>waiting for a message from him. And do you know what that man has<br/>been to me? Five years ago, when Kuzma brought me here, I used to<br/>shut myself up, that no one might have sight or sound of me. I was<br/>a silly slip of a girl; I used to sit here sobbing; I used to lie<br/>awake all night, thinking: 'Where is he now, the man who wronged<br/>me? He is laughing at me with another woman, most likely. If only I<br/>could see him, if I could meet him again, I'd pay him out, I'd pay<br/>him out!' At night I used to lie sobbing into my pillow in the<br/>dark, and I used to brood over it; I used to tear my heart on<br/>purpose and gloat over my anger. 'I'll pay him out, I'll pay him<br/>out! That's what I used to cry out in the dark. And when I suddenly<br/>thought that I should really do nothing to him, and that he was<br/>laughing at me then, or perhaps had utterly forgotten me, I would<br/>fling myself on the floor, melt into helpless tears, and lie there<br/>shaking till dawn. In the morning I would get up more spiteful than<br/>a dog, ready to tear the whole world to pieces. And then what do<br/>you think? I began saving money, I became hardhearted, grew stout-<br/>grew wiser, would you say? No, no one in the whole world sees it,<br/>no one knows it, but when night comes on, I sometimes lie as I did<br/>five years ago, when I was a silly girl, clenching my teeth and<br/>crying all night, thinking, 'I'll pay him out, I'll pay him out!'<br/>Do you hear? Well then, now you understand me. A month ago a letter<br/>came to me- he was coming, he was a widower, he wanted to see me.<br/>It took my breath away; then I suddenly thought: 'If he comes and<br/>whistles to call me, I shall creep back to him like a beaten dog.'<br/>I couldn't believe myself. Am I so abject? Shall I run to him or<br/>not? And I've been in such a rage with myself all this month that I<br/>am worse than I was five years ago. Do you see now, Alyosha, what a<br/>violent, vindictive creature I am? I have shown you the whole<br/>truth! I played with Mitya to keep me from running to that other.<br/>Hush, Rakitin, it's not for you to judge me, I am not speaking to<br/>you. Before you came in, I was lying here waiting, brooding,<br/>deciding my whole future life, and you can never know what was in<br/>my heart. Yes, Alyosha, tell your young lady not to be angry with<br/>me for what happened the day before yesterday… . Nobody in the<br/>whole world knows what I am going through now, and no one ever can<br/>know… . For perhaps I shall take a knife with me to-day, I can't<br/>make up my mind… "<br/><br/>And at this "tragic" phrase Grushenka broke down, hid her face<br/>in her hands, flung herself on the sofa pillows, and sobbed like a<br/>little child.<br/><br/>Alyosha got up and went to Rakitin.<br/><br/>"Misha," he said, "don't be angry. She wounded you, but don't be<br/>angry. You heard what she said just now? You mustn't ask too much<br/>of human endurance, one must be merciful."<br/><br/>Alyosha said this at the instinctive prompting of his heart. He<br/>felt obliged to speak and he turned to Rakitin. If Rakitin had not<br/>been there, he would have spoken to the air. But Rakitin looked at<br/>him ironically and Alyosha stopped short.<br/><br/>"You were so primed up with your elder's reading last night that<br/>now you have to let it off on me, Alexey, man of God!" said<br/>Rakitin, with a smile of hatred.<br/><br/>"Don't laugh, Rakitin, don't smile, don't talk of the dead- he<br/>was better than anyone in the world!" cried Alyosha, with tears in<br/>his voice. "I didn't speak to you as a judge but as the lowest of<br/>the judged. What am I beside her? I came here seeking my ruin, and<br/>said to myself, 'What does it matter?' in my cowardliness, but she,<br/>after five years in torment, as soon as anyone says a word from the<br/>heart to her- it makes her forget everything, forgive everything,<br/>in her tears! The man who has wronged her has come back, he sends<br/>for her and she forgives him everything, and hastens joyfully to<br/>meet him and she won't take a knife with her. She won't! No, I am<br/>not like that. I don't know whether you are, Misha, but I am not<br/>like that. It's a lesson to me… . She is more loving than we… .<br/>Have you heard her speak before of what she has just told us? No,<br/>you haven't; if you had, you'd have understood her long ago… and<br/>the person insulted the day before yesterday must forgive her, too!<br/>She will, when she knows… and she shall know… . This soul is not<br/>yet at peace with itself, one must be tender with… there may be a<br/>treasure in that soul… ."<br/><br/>Alyosha stopped, because he caught his breath. In spite of his<br/>ill-humour Rakitin looked at him with astonishment. He had never<br/>expected such a tirade from the gentle Alyosha.<br/><br/>"She's found someone to plead her cause! Why, are you in love<br/>with her? Agrafena Alexandrovna, our monk's really in love with<br/>you, you've made a conquest!" he cried, with a coarse laugh.<br/><br/>Grushenka lifted her head from the pillow and looked at Alyosha<br/>with a tender smile shining on her tear-stained face.<br/><br/>
