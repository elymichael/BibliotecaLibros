<br/>"Go!" said I, "confess. Everything passes, only the truth<br/>remains. Your children will understand, when they grow up, the<br/>nobility of your resolution."<br/><br/>He left me that time as though he had made up his mind. Yet for<br/>more than a fortnight afterwards, he came to me every evening,<br/>still preparing himself, still unable to bring himself to the<br/>point. He made my heart ache. One day he would come determined and<br/>say fervently:<br/><br/>"I know it will be heaven for me, heaven, the moment I confess.<br/>Fourteen years I've been in hell. I want to suffer. I will take my<br/>punishment and begin to live. You can pass through the world doing<br/>wrong, but there's no turning back. Now I dare not love my<br/>neighbour nor even my own children. Good God, my children will<br/>understand, perhaps, what my punishment has cost me and will not<br/>condemn me! God is not in strength but in truth."<br/><br/>"All will understand your sacrifice," I said to him, "if not at<br/>once, they will understand later; for you have served truth, the<br/>higher truth, not of the earth."<br/><br/>And he would go away seeming comforted, but next day he would<br/>come again, bitter, pale, sarcastic.<br/><br/>"Every time I come to you, you look at me so inquisitively as<br/>though to say, 'He has still not confessed!' Wait a bit, don't<br/>despise me too much. It's not such an easy thing to do as you would<br/>think. Perhaps I shall not do it at all. You won't go and inform<br/>against me then, will you?"<br/><br/>And far from looking at him with indiscreet curiosity, I was<br/>afraid to look at him at all. I was quite ill from anxiety, and my<br/>heart was full of tears. I could not sleep at night.<br/><br/>"I have just come from my wife," he went on. "Do you understand<br/>what the word 'wife' means? When I went out, the children called to<br/>me, 'Good-bye, father, make haste back to read The Children's<br/>Magazine with us.' No, you don't understand that! No one is wise<br/>from another man's woe."<br/><br/>His eyes were glittering, his lips were twitching. Suddenly he<br/>struck the table with his fist so that everything on it danced- it<br/>was the first time he had done such a thing, he was such a mild<br/>man.<br/><br/>"But need I?" he exclaimed, "must I? No one has been condemned,<br/>no one has been sent to Siberia in my place, the man died of fever.<br/>And I've been punished by my sufferings for the blood I shed. And I<br/>shan't be believed, they won't believe my proofs. Need I confess,<br/>need I? I am ready to go on suffering all my life for the blood I<br/>have shed, if only my wife and children may be spared. Will it be<br/>just to ruin them with me? Aren't we making a mistake? What is<br/>right in this case? And will people recognise it, will they<br/>appreciate it, will they respect it?"<br/><br/>
