"I thank you sincerely," said Grushenka, bowing to him, "I'm
going with this old gentleman; I am driving him back to town with
me, and meanwhile, if you'll allow me, I'll wait below to hear what
you decide about Dmitri Fyodorovitch."

She went out. Mitya was calm, and even looked more cheerful, but
only for a moment. He felt more and more oppressed by a strange
physical weakness. His eyes were closing with fatigue. The
examination of the witnesses was, at last, over. They procceded to
a revision of the protocol. Mitya got up, moved from his chair to
the corner by the curtain, lay down on a large chest covered with a
rug, and instantly fell asleep.

He had a strange dream, utterly out of keeping with the place
and the time.

He was driving somewhere in the steppes, where he had been
stationed long ago, and a peasant was driving him in a cart with a
pair of horses, through snow and sleet. He was cold, it was early
in November, and the snow was falling in big wet flakes, melting as
soon as it touched the earth. And the peasant drove him smartly, he
had a fair, long beard. He was not an old man, somewhere about
fifty, and he had on a grey peasant's smock. Not far off was a
village, he could see the black huts, and half the huts were burnt
down, there were only the charred beams sticking up. And as they
drove in, there were peasant women drawn up along the road, a lot
of women, a whole row, all thin and wan, with their faces a sort of
brownish colour, especially one at the edge, a tall, bony woman,
who looked forty, but might have been only twenty, with a long thin
face. And in her arms was a little baby crying. And her breasts
seemed so dried up that there was not a drop of milk in them. And
the child cried and cried, and held out its little bare arms, with
its little fists blue from cold.

"Why are they crying? Why are they crying?" Mitya asked, as they
dashed gaily by.

"It's the babe," answered the driver, "the babe weeping."

And Mitya was struck by his saying, in his peasant way, "the
babe," and he liked the peasant's calling it a "babe." There seemed
more pity in it.

"But why is it weeping?" Mitya persisted stupidly, "why are its
little arms bare? Why don't they wrap it up?"

"The babe's cold, its little clothes are frozen and don't warm
it."

"But why is it? Why?" foolish Mitya still persisted.
