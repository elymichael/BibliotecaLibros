"Brother, you don't seem to have noticed how you've insulted
Katerina Ivanovna by telling Grushenka about that day. And she
flung it in her face just now that she had gone to gentlemen in
secret to sell her beauty! Brother, what could be worse than that
insult?"

What worried Alyosha more than anything was that, incredible as
it seemed, his brother appeared pleased at Katerina Ivanovna's
humiliation.

"Bah!" Dmitri frowned fiercely, and struck his forehead with his
hand. He only now realised it, though Alyosha had just told him of
the insult, and Katerina Ivanovna's cry: "Your brother is a
scoundrel"

"Yes, perhaps, I really did tell Grushenka about that 'fatal
day,' as Katya calls it. Yes, I did tell her, I remember! It was
that time at Mokroe. I was drunk, the Gypsies were singing… But I
was sobbing. I was sobbing then, kneeling and praying to Katya's
image, and Grushenka understood it. She understood it all then. I
remember, she cried herself… . Damn it all! But it's bound to be so
now… . Then she cried, but now 'the dagger in the heart'! That's
how women are."

He looked down and sank into thought.

"Yes, I am a scoundrel, a thorough scoundrel" he said suddenly,
in a gloomy voice. "It doesn't matter whether I cried or not, I'm a
scoundrel! Tell her I accept the name, if that's any comfort. Come,
that's enough. Good-bye. It's no use talking! It's not amusing. You
go your way and I mine. And I don't want to see you again except as
a last resource. Good-bye, Alexey!"

He warmly pressed Alyosha's hand, and still looking down,
without raising his head, as though tearing himself away, turned
rapidly towards the town.

Alyosha looked after him, unable to believe he would go away so
abruptly.

"Stay, Alexey, one more confession to you alone" cried Dmitri,
suddenly turning back. "Look at me. Look at me well. You see here,
here- there's terrible disgrace in store for me." (As he said
"here," Dmitri struck his chest with his fist with a strange air,
as though the dishonour lay precisely on his chest, in some spot,
in a pocket, perhaps, or hanging round his neck.) "You know me now,
a scoundrel, an avowed scoundrel, but let me tell you that I've
never done anything before and never shall again, anything that can
compare in baseness with the dishonour which I bear now at this
very minute on my breast, here, here, which will come to pass,
though I'm perfectly free to stop it. I can stop it or carry it
through, note that. Well, let me tell you, I shall carry it
through. I shan't stop it. I told you everything just now, but I
didn't tell you this, because even I had not brass enough for it. I
can still pull up; if I do, I can give back the full half of my
lost honour to-morrow. But I shan't pull up. I shall carry out my
base plan, and you can bear witness that I told so beforehand.
Darkness and destruction! No need to explain. You'll find out in
due time. The filthy back-alley and the she-devil. Good-bye. Don't
pray for me, I'm not worth it. And there's no need, no need at all…
. I don't need it! Away!"

And he suddenly retreated, this time finally. Alyosha went
towards the monastery.

"What? I shall never see him again! What is he saying?" he
wondered wildly. "Why, I shall certainly see him to-morrow. I shall
look him up. I shall make a point of it. What does he mean?"
