Alyosha bent a long wondering look upon her and a light seemed
to dawn in his face.

"Rakitin," he said suddenly, in a firm and loud voice; "don't
taunt me with having rebelled against God. I don't want to feel
angry with you, so you must be kinder, too; I've lost a treasure
such as you have never had, and you cannot judge me now. You had
much better look at her- do you see how she has pity on me? I came
here to find a wicked soul- I felt drawn to evil because I was base
and evil myself, and I've found a true sister; I have found a
treasure- a loving heart. She had pity on me just nowâ€¦ . Agrafena
Alexandrovna, I am speaking of you. You've raised my soul from the
depths."

Alyosha's lips were quivering and he caught his breath.

"She has saved you, it seems," laughed Rakitin spitefully. "And
she meant to get you in her clutches, do your realise that?"

"Stay, Rakitin." Grushenka jumped up. "Hush, both of you. Now
I'll tell you all about it. Hush, Alyosha, your words make me
ashamed, for I am bad and not good- that's what I am. And you hush,
Rakitin, because you are telling lies. I had the low idea of trying
to get him in my clutches, but now you are lying, now it's all
different. And don't let me hear anything more from you,
Rakitin."

All this Grushenka said with extreme emotion.

"They are both crazy," said Rakitin, looking at them with
amazement. "I feel as though I were in a madhouse. They're both
getting so feeble they'll begin crying in a minute."

"I shall begin to cry, I shall," repeated Grushenka. "He called
me his sister and I shall never forget that. Only let me tell you,
Rakitin, though I am bad, I did give away an onion."

"An onion? Hang it all, you really are crazy."

Rakitin wondered at their enthusiasm. He was aggrieved and
annoyed, though he might have reflected that each of them was just
passing through a spiritual crisis such as does not come often in a
lifetime. But though Rakitin was very sensitive about everything
that concerned himself, he was very obtuse as regards the feelings
and sensations of others- partly from his youth and inexperience,
partly from his intense egoism.
