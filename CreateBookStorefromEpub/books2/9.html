<br/>Why Ivan Fyodorovitch had come amongst us I remember asking<br/>myself at the time with a certain uneasiness. This fateful visit,<br/>which was the first step leading to so many consequences, I never<br/>fully explained to myself. It seemed strange on the face of it that<br/>a young man so learned, so proud, and apparently so cautious,<br/>should suddenly visit such an infamous house and a father who had<br/>ignored him all his life, hardly knew him, never thought of him,<br/>and would not under any circumstances have given him money, though<br/>he was always afraid that his sons Ivan and Alexey would also come<br/>to ask him for it. And here the young man was staying in the house<br/>of such a father, had been living with him for two months, and they<br/>were on the best possible terms. This last fact was a special cause<br/>of wonder to many others as well as to me. Pyotr Alexandrovitch<br/>Miusov, of whom we have spoken already, the cousin of Fyodor<br/>Pavlovitch's first wife, happened to be in the neighbourhood again<br/>on a visit to his estate. He had come from Paris, which was his<br/>permanent home. I remember that he was more surprised than anyone<br/>when he made the acquaintance of the young man, who interested him<br/>extremely, and with whom he sometimes argued and not without inner<br/>pang compared himself in acquirements.<br/><br/>"He is proud," he used to say, "he will never be in want of<br/>pence; he has got money enough to go abroad now. What does he want<br/>here? Everyone can see that he hasn't come for money, for his<br/>father would never give him any. He has no taste for drink and<br/>dissipation, and yet his father can't do without him. They get on<br/>so well together!"<br/><br/>That was the truth; the young man had an unmistakable influence<br/>over his father, who positively appeared to be behaving more<br/>decently and even seemed at times ready to obey his son, though<br/>often extremely and even spitefully perverse.<br/><br/>It was only later that we learned that Ivan had come partly at<br/>the request of, and in the interests of, his elder brother, Dmitri,<br/>whom he saw for the first time on this very visit, though he had<br/>before leaving Moscow been in correspondence with him about an<br/>important matter of more concern to Dmitri than himself. What that<br/>business was the reader will learn fully in due time. Yet even when<br/>I did know of this special circumstance I still felt Ivan<br/>Fyodorovitch to be an enigmatic figure, and thought his visit<br/>rather mysterious.<br/><br/>I may add that Ivan appeared at the time in the light of a<br/>mediator between his father and his elder brother Dmitri, who was<br/>in open quarrel with his father and even planning to bring an<br/>action against him.<br/><br/>The family, I repeat, was now united for the first time, and<br/>some of its members met for the first time in their lives. The<br/>younger brother, Alexey, had been a year already among us, having<br/>been the first of the three to arrive. It is of that brother Alexey<br/>I find it most difficult to speak in this introduction. Yet I must<br/>give some preliminary account of him, if only to explain one queer<br/>fact, which is that I have to introduce my hero to the reader<br/>wearing the cassock of a novice. Yes, he had been for the last year<br/>in our monastery, and seemed willing to be cloistered there for the<br/>rest of his life.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
