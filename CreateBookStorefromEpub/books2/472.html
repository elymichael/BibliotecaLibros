"Yes, I want disorder. I keep wanting to set fire to the house.<br/>I keep imagining how I'll creep up and set fire to the house on the<br/>sly; it must be on the sly. They'll try to put it out, but it'll go<br/>on burning. And I shall know and say nothing. Ah, what silliness!<br/>And how bored I am!"<br/><br/>She waved her hand with a look of repulsion.<br/><br/>"It's your luxurious life," said Alyosha, softly"<br/><br/>"Is it better, then, to be poor?"<br/><br/>"Yes, it is better."<br/><br/>"That's what your monk taught you. That's not true. Let me be<br/>rich and all the rest poor, I'll eat sweets and drink cream and not<br/>give any to anyone else. Ach, don't speak, don't say anything"; she<br/>shook her hand at him, though Alyosha had not opened his mouth.<br/>"You've told me all that before, I know it all by heart. It bores<br/>me. If I am ever poor, I shall murder somebody, and even if I am<br/>rich, I may murder someone, perhaps- why do nothing! But do you<br/>know, I should like to reap, cut the rye? I'll marry you, and you<br/>shall become a peasant, a real peasant; we'll keep a colt, shall<br/>we? Do you know Kalganov?"<br/><br/>"Yes."<br/><br/>"He is always wandering about, dreaming. He says, 'Why live in<br/>real life? It's better to dream. One can dream the most delightful<br/>things, but real life is a bore.' But he'll be married soon for all<br/>that; he's been making love to me already. Can you spin tops?"<br/><br/>"Yes."<br/><br/>"Well, he's just like a top: he wants to be wound up and set<br/>spinning and then to be lashed, lashed, lashed with a whip. If I<br/>marry him, I'll keep him spinning all his life. You are not ashamed<br/>to be with me?"<br/><br/>"No."<br/>
