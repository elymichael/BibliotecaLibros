"Ah, an irreverent expression! Well, what of it? Anyway, what<br/>does that vision mean?"<br/><br/>"I don't know what it means, Misha."<br/><br/>"I knew he wouldn't explain it to you There's nothing wonderful<br/>about it, of course, only the usual holy mummery. But there was an<br/>object in the performance. All the pious people in the town will<br/>talk about it and spread the story through the province, wondering<br/>what it meant. To my thinking the old man really has a keen nose;<br/>he sniffed a crime. Your house stinks of it."<br/><br/>Rakitin evidently had something he was eager to speak of.<br/><br/>"It'll be in your family, this crime. Between your brothers and<br/>your rich old father. So Father Zossima flopped down to be ready<br/>for what may turn up. If something happens later on, it'll be: 'Ah,<br/>the holy man foresaw it, prophesied it!' though it's a poor sort of<br/>prophecy, flopping like that. 'Ah, but it was symbolic,' they'll<br/>say, 'an allegory,' and the devil knows what all! It'll be<br/>remembered to his glory: 'He predicted the crime and marked the<br/>criminal!' That's always the way with these crazy fanatics; they<br/>cross themselves at the tavern and throw stones at the temple. Like<br/>your elder, he takes a stick to a just man and falls at the feet of<br/>a murderer."<br/><br/>"What crime? What do you mean?"<br/><br/>Alyosha stopped dead. Rakitin stopped, too.<br/><br/>"What murderer? As though you didn't know! I'll bet you've<br/>thought of it before. That's interesting, too, by the way. Listen,<br/>Alyosha, you always speak the truth, though you're always between<br/>two stools. Have you thought of it or not? Answer."<br/><br/>"I have," answered Alyosha in a low voice. Even Rakitin was<br/>taken aback.<br/><br/>"What? Have you really?" he cried.<br/><br/>"Iâ€¦ I've not exactly thought it," muttered Alyosha, "but<br/>directly you began speaking so strangely, I fancied I had thought<br/>of it myself."<br/>
