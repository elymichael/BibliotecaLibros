Mitya's eyes flashed.<br/><br/>"We are in no mood for joking," answered Nikolay Parfenovitch<br/>sternly.<br/><br/>"Well, if I must-" muttered Mitya, and sitting down on the bed,<br/>he took off his socks. He felt unbearably awkward. All were<br/>clothed, while he was naked, and strange to say, when he was<br/>undressed he felt somehow guilty in their presence, and was almost<br/>ready to believe himself that he was inferior to them, and that now<br/>they had a perfect right to despise him.<br/><br/>"When all are undressed, one is somehow not ashamed, but when<br/>one's the only one undressed and everybody is looking, it's<br/>degrading," he kept repeating to himself, again and again. "It's<br/>like a dream; I've sometimes dreamed of being in such degrading<br/>positions." It was a misery to him to take off his socks. They were<br/>very dirty, and so were his underclothes, and now everyone could<br/>see it. And what was worse, he disliked his feet. All his life he<br/>had thought both his big toes hideous. He particularly loathed the<br/>coarse, flat, crooked nail on the right one, and now they would all<br/>see it. Feeling intolerably ashamed made him, at once and<br/>intentionally, rougher. He pulled off his shirt, himself.<br/><br/>"Would you like to look anywhere else if you're not ashamed<br/>to?"<br/><br/>"No, there's no need to, at present."<br/><br/>"Well, am I to stay naked like this?" he added savagely.<br/><br/>"Yes, that can't be helped for the time… . Kindly sit down here<br/>for a while. You can wrap yourself in a quilt from the bed, and I…<br/>I'll see to all this."<br/><br/>All the things were shown to the witnesses. The report of the<br/>search was drawn up, and at last Nikolay Parfenovitch went out, and<br/>the clothes were carried out after him. Ippolit Kirillovitch went<br/>out, too. Mitya was left alone with the peasants, who stood in<br/>silence, never taking their eyes off him. Mitya wrapped himself up<br/>in the quilt. He felt cold. His bare feet stuck out, and he<br/>couldn't pull the quilt over so as to cover them. Nikolay<br/>Parfenovitch seemed to be gone a long time, "an insufferable<br/>time."<br/><br/>"He thinks of me as a puppy," thought Mitya, gnashing his teeth.<br/>"That rotten prosecutor has gone, too, contemptuous no doubt, it<br/>disgusts him to see me naked!"<br/><br/>Mitya imagined, however, that his clothes would be examined and<br/>returned to him. But what was his indignation when Nikolay<br/>Parfenovitch came back with quite different clothes, brought in<br/>behind him by a peasant.<br/>
