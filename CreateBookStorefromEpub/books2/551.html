This fact was a complete surprise to everyone; no one in the<br/>town nor in the monastery, not even Mitya, knew of it. I was told<br/>that Rakitin turned purple with shame where he sat. Grushenka had<br/>somehow heard before she came into the court that he had given<br/>evidence against Mitya, and so she was angry. The whole effect on<br/>the public, of Rakitin's speech, of his noble sentiments, of his<br/>attacks upon serfdom and the political disorder of Russia, was this<br/>time finally ruined. Fetyukovitch was satisfied: it was another<br/>godsend. Grushenka's cross-examination did not last long and, of<br/>course, there could be nothing particularly new in her evidence.<br/>She left a very disagreeable impression on the public; hundreds of<br/>contemptuous eyes were fixed upon her, as she finished giving her<br/>evidence and sat down again in the court, at a good distance from<br/>Katerina Ivanovna. Mitya was silent throughout her evidence. He sat<br/>as though turned to stone, with his eyes fixed on the ground.<br/><br/>Ivan was called to give evidence.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
