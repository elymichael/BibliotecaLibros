"How could I have said it more directly then? It was simply my
fear that made me speak, and you might have been angry, too. I
might well have been apprehensive that Dmitri Fyodorovitch would
make a scene and carry away that money, for he considered it as
good as his own; but who could tell that it would end in a murder
like this? I thought that he would only carry off the three
thousand that lay under the master's mattress in the envelope, and
you see, he's murdered him. How could you guess it either,
sir?"

"But if you say yourself that it couldn't be guessed, how could
I have guessed and stayed at home? You contradict yourself!" said
Ivan, pondering.

"You might have guessed from my sending you to Tchermashnya and
not to Moscow."

"How could I guess it from that?"

Smerdyakov seemed much exhausted, and again he was silent for a
minute.

"You might have guessed from the fact of my asking you not to go
to Moscow, but to Tchermashnya, that I wanted to have you nearer,
for Moscow's a long way off, and Dmitri Fyodorovitch, knowing you
are not far off, would not be so bold. And if anything had
happened, you might have come to protect me, too, for I warned you
of Grigory Vassilyevitch's illness, and that I was afraid of having
a fit. And when I explained those knocks to you, by means of which
one could go in to the deceased, and that Dmitri Fyodorovitch knew
them all through me, I thought that you would guess yourself that
he would be sure to do something, and so wouldn't go to
Tchermashnya even, but would stay."

"He talks very coherently," thought Ivan, "though he does
mumble; what's the derangement of his faculties that Herzenstube
talked of?"

"You are cunning with me, damn you!" he exclaimed, getting
angry.

"But I thought at the time that you quite guessed," Smerdyakov
parried with the simplest air.

"If I'd guessed, I should have stayed," cried Ivan.

"Why, I thought that it was because you guessed, that you went
away in such a hurry, only to get out of trouble, only to run away
and save yourself in your fright."
