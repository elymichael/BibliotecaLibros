<br/>"Ah, brother, but a Balaam's ass like that thinks and thinks,<br/>and the devil knows where he gets to."<br/><br/>"He's storing up ideas," said Ivan, smiling.<br/><br/>"You see, I know he can't bear me, nor anyone else, even you,<br/>though you fancy that he has a high opinion of you. Worse still<br/>with Alyosha, he despises Alyosha. But he doesn't steal, that's one<br/>thing, and he's not a gossip, he holds his tongue, and doesn't wash<br/>our dirty linen in public. He makes capital fish pasties too. But,<br/>damn him, is he worth talking about so much?"<br/><br/>"Of course he isn't."<br/><br/>"And as for the ideas he may be hatching, the Russian peasant,<br/>generally speaking, needs thrashing. That I've always maintained.<br/>Our peasants are swindlers, and don't deserve to be pitied, and<br/>it's a good thing they're still flogged sometimes. Russia is rich<br/>in birches. If they destroyed the forests, it would be the ruin of<br/>Russia. I stand up for the clever people. We've left off thrashing<br/>the peasants, we've grown so clever, but they go on thrashing<br/>themselves. And a good thing too. 'For with what measure ye mete it<br/>shall be measured to you again,' or how does it go? Anyhow, it will<br/>be measured. But Russia's all swinishness. My dear, if you only<br/>knew how I hate Russia… . That is, not Russia, but all this vice!<br/>But maybe I mean Russia. Tout cela c'est de la cochonnerie…<br/>.<br/>[4]<br/>Do you know what I like? I like wit."<br/>"You've had another glass. That's enough." "Wait a bit. I'll have<br/>one more, and then another, and then I'll stop. No, stay, you<br/>interrupted me. At Mokroe I was talking to an old man, and he told<br/>me: 'There's nothing we like so much as sentencing girls to be<br/>thrashed, and we always give the lads the job of thrashing them.<br/>And the girl he has thrashed to-day, the young man will ask in<br/>marriage to-morrow. So it quite suits the girls, too,' he said.<br/>There's a set of de Sades for you! But it's clever, anyway. Shall<br/>we go over and have a look at it, eh? Alyosha, are you blushing?<br/>Don't be bashful, child. I'm sorry I didn't stay to dinner at the<br/>Superior's and tell the monks about the girls at Mokroe. Alyosha,<br/>don't be angry that I offended your Superior this morning. I lost<br/>my temper. If there is a God, if He exists, then, of course, I'm to<br/>blame, and I shall have to answer for it. But if there isn't a God<br/>at all, what do they deserve, your fathers? It's not enough to cut<br/>their heads off, for they keep back progress. Would you believe it,<br/>Ivan, that that lacerates my sentiments? No, you don't believe it<br/>as I see from your eyes. You believe what people say, that I'm<br/>nothing but a buffoon. Alyosha, do you believe that I'm nothing but<br/>a buffoon?" "No, I don't believe it." "And I believe you don't, and<br/>that you speak the truth. You look sincere and you speak sincerely.<br/>But not Ivan. Ivan's supercilious… . I'd make an end of your monks,<br/>though, all the same. I'd take all that mystic stuff and suppress<br/>it, once for all, all over Russia, so as to bring all the fools to<br/>reason. And the gold and the silver that would flow into the mint!"<br/>"But why suppress it?" asked Ivan. "That Truth may prevail. That's<br/>why." "Well, if Truth were to prevail, you know, you'd be the first<br/>to be robbed and suppressed." "Ah! I dare say you're right. Ah, I'm<br/>an ass!" burst out Fyodor Pavlovitch, striking himself lightly on<br/>the forehead. "Well, your monastery may stand then, Alyosha, if<br/>that's how it is. And we clever people will sit snug and enjoy our<br/>brandy. You know, Ivan, it must have been so ordained by the<br/>Almighty Himself. Ivan, speak, is there a God or not? Stay, speak<br/>the truth, speak seriously. Why are you laughing again?" "I'm<br/>laughing that you should have made a clever remark just now about<br/>Smerdyakov's belief in the existence of two saints who could move<br/>mountains." "Why, am I like him now, then?" "Very much." "Well,<br/>that shows I'm a Russian, too, and I have a Russian characteristic.<br/>And you may be caught in the same way, though you are a<br/>philosopher. Shall I catch you? What do you bet that I'll catch you<br/>to-morrow? Speak, all the same, is there a God, or not? Only, be<br/>serious. I want you to be serious now." "No, there is no God."<br/>"Alyosha, is there a God?" "There is." "Ivan, and is there<br/>immortality of some sort, just a little, just a tiny bit?" "There<br/>is no immortality either." "None at all?" "None at all." "There's<br/>absolute nothingness then. Perhaps there is just something?<br/>Anything is better than nothing!" "Alyosha, is there immortality?"<br/>"God and immortality?" "God and immortality. In God is<br/>immortality." "H'm! It's more likely Ivan's right. Good Lord! to<br/>think what faith, what force of all kinds, man has lavished for<br/>nothing, on that dream, and for how many thousand years. Who is it<br/>laughing at man? Ivan For the last time, once for all, is there a<br/>God or not? I ask for the last time!" "And for the last time there<br/>is not." "Who is laughing at mankind, Ivan?" "It must be the<br/>devil," said Ivan, smiling. "And the devil? Does he exist?" "No,<br/>there's no devil either." "It's a pity. Damn it all, what wouldn't<br/>I do to the man who first invented God! Hanging on a bitter aspen<br/>tree would be too good for, him." "There would have been no<br/>civilisation if they hadn't invented God." "Wouldn't there have<br/>been? Without God?" "No. And there would have been no brandy<br/>either. But I must take your brandy away from you, anyway." "Stop,<br/>stop, stop, dear boy, one more little glass. I've hurt Alyosha's<br/>feelings. You're not angry with me, Alyosha? My dear little<br/>Alexey!" "No, I am not angry. I know your thoughts. Your heart is<br/>better than your head." "My heart better than my head, is it? Oh<br/>Lord! And that from you. Ivan, do you love Alyosha?" "You must love<br/>him" (Fyodor Pavlovitch was by this time very drunk). "Listen,<br/>Alyosha, I was rude to your elder this morning. But I was excited.<br/>But there's wit in that elder, don't you think, Ivan?" "Very<br/>likely." "There is, there is. Il y a du Piron la-dedans.* He's a<br/>Jesuit, a Russian one, that is. As he's an honourable person<br/>there's a hidden indignation boiling within him at having to<br/>pretend and affect holiness." * There's something of Piron inside<br/>of him. "But, of course, he believes in God." "Not a bit of it.<br/>Didn't you know? Why, he tells everyone so, himself. That is, not<br/>everyone, but all the clever people who come to him. He said<br/>straight out to Governor Schultz not long ago: 'Credo, but I don't<br/>know in what.'" "Really?" "He really did. But I respect him.<br/>There's something of Mephistopheles about him, or rather of 'The<br/>hero of our time'… Arbenin, or what's his name?… You see, he's a<br/>sensualist. He's such a sensualist that I should be afraid for my<br/>daughter or my wife if she went to confess to him. You know, when<br/>he begins telling stories… The year before last he invited us to<br/>tea, tea with liqueur (the ladies send him liqueur), and began<br/>telling us about old times till we nearly split our sides… .<br/>Especially how he once cured a paralysed woman. 'If my legs were<br/>not bad I know a dance I could dance you,' he said. What do you say<br/>to that? 'I've plenty of tricks in my time,' said he. He did<br/>Demidov, the merchant, out of sixty thousand." "What, he stole it?"<br/>"He brought him the money as a man he could trust, saying, 'Take<br/>care of it for me, friend, there'll be a police search at my place<br/>to-morrow.' And he kept it. 'You have given it to the Church,' he<br/>declared. I said to him: 'You're a scoundrel,' I said. 'No,' said<br/>he, 'I'm not a scoundrel, but I'm broadminded.' But that wasn't he,<br/>that was someone else. I've muddled him with someone else… without<br/>noticing it. Come, another glass and that's enough. Take away the<br/>bottle, Ivan. I've been telling lies. Why didn't you stop me, Ivan,<br/>and tell me I was lying?" "I knew you'd stop of yourself." "That's<br/>a lie. You did it from spite, from simple spite against me. You<br/>despise me. You have come to me and despised me in my own house."<br/>"Well, I'm going away. You've had too much brandy." "I've begged<br/>you for Christ's sake to go to Tchermashnya for a day or two, and<br/>you don't go." "I'll go to-morrow if you're so set upon it." "You<br/>won't go. You want to keep an eye on me. That's what you want,<br/>spiteful fellow. That's why you won't go." The old man persisted.<br/>He had reached that state of drunkenness when the drunkard who has<br/>till then been inoffensive tries to pick a quarrel and to assert<br/>himself. "Why are you looking at me? Why do you look like that?<br/>Your eyes look at me and say, 'You ugly drunkard!' Your eyes are<br/>mistrustful. They're contemptuous… . You've come here with some<br/>design. Alyosha, here, looks at me and his eyes shine. Alyosha<br/>doesn't despise me. Alexey, you mustn't love Ivan." "Don't be<br/>ill-tempered with my brother. Leave off attacking him," Alyosha<br/>said emphatically. "Oh, all right. Ugh, my head aches. Take away<br/>the brandy, Ivan. It's the third time I've told you." He mused, and<br/>suddenly a slow, cunning grin spread over his face. "Don't be angry<br/>with a feeble old man, Ivan. I know you don't love me, but don't be<br/>angry all the same. You've nothing to love me for. You go to<br/>Tchermashnya. I'll come to you myself and bring you a present. I'll<br/>show you a little wench there. I've had my eye on her a long time.<br/>She's still running about bare-foot. Don't be afraid of bare-footed<br/>wenches- don't despise them- they're pearls!" And he kissed his<br/>hand with a smack. "To my thinking," he revived at once, seeming to<br/>grow sober the instant he touched on his favourite topic. "To my<br/>thinking… Ah, you boys! You children, little sucking-pigs, to my<br/>thinking… I never thought a woman ugly in my life- that's been my<br/>rule! Can you understand that? How could you understand it? You've<br/>milk in your veins, not blood. You're not out of your shells yet.<br/>My rule has been that you can always find something devilishly<br/>interesting in every woman that you wouldn't find in any other.<br/>Only, one must know how to find it, that's the point! That's a<br/>talent! To my mind there are no ugly women. The very fact that she<br/>is a woman is half the battle… but how could you understand that?<br/>Even in vieilles filles, even in them you may discover something<br/>that makes you simply wonder that men have been such fools as to<br/>let them grow old without noticing them. Bare-footed girls or<br/>unattractive ones, you must take by surprise. Didn't you know that?<br/>You must astound them till they're fascinated, upset, ashamed that<br/>such a gentleman should fall in love with such a little slut. It's<br/>a jolly good thing that there always are and will be masters and<br/>slaves in the world, so there always will be a little<br/>maid-of-all-work and her master, and you know, that's all that's<br/>needed for happiness. Stay… listen, Alyosha, I always used to<br/>surprise your mother, but in a different way. I paid no attention<br/>to her at all, but all at once, when the minute came, I'd be all<br/>devotion to her, crawl on my knees, kiss her feet, and I always,<br/>always- I remember it as though it were to-day- reduced her to that<br/>tinkling, quiet, nervous, queer little laugh. It was peculiar to<br/>her. I knew her attacks always used to begin like that. The next<br/>day she would begin shrieking hysterically, and this little laugh<br/>was not a sign of delight, though it made a very good counterfeit.<br/>That's the great thing, to know how to take everyone. Once<br/>Belyavsky- he was a handsome fellow, and rich- used to like to come<br/>here and hang about her- suddenly gave me a slap in the face in her<br/>presence. And she- such a mild sheep- why, I thought she would have<br/>knocked me down for that blow. How she set on me! 'You're beaten,<br/>beaten now,' she said, 'You've taken a blow from him. You have been<br/>trying to sell me to him,' she said… 'And how dared he strike you<br/>in my presence! Don't dare come near me again, never, never! Run at<br/>once, challenge him to a duel!'… I took her to the monastery then<br/>to bring her to her senses. The holy Fathers prayed her back to<br/>reason. But I swear, by God, Alyosha, I never insulted the poor<br/>crazy girl! Only once, perhaps, in the first year; then she was<br/>very fond of praying. She used to keep the feasts of Our Lady<br/>particularly and used to turn me out of her room then. I'll knock<br/>that mysticism out of her, thought I! 'Here,' said I, 'you see your<br/>holy image. Here it is. Here I take it down. You believe it's<br/>miraculous, but here, I'll spit on it directly and nothing will<br/>happen to me for it!'… When she saw it, good Lord! I thought she<br/>would kill me. But she only jumped up, wrung her hands, then<br/>suddenly hid her face in them, began trembling all over and fell on<br/>the floor… fell all of a heap. Alyosha, Alyosha, what's the<br/>matter?" The old man jumped up in alarm. From the time he had begun<br/>speaking about his mother, a change had gradually come over<br/>Alyosha's face. He flushed crimson, his eyes glowed, his lips<br/>quivered. The old sot had gone spluttering on, noticing nothing,<br/>till the moment when something very strange happened to Alyosha.<br/>Precisely what he was describing in the crazy woman was suddenly<br/>repeated with Alyosha. He jumped up from his seat exactly as his<br/>mother was said to have done, wrung his hands, hid his face in<br/>them, and fell back in his chair, shaking all over in an hysterical<br/>paroxysm of sudden violent, silent weeping. His extraordinary<br/>resemblance to his mother particularly impressed the old man.<br/>"Ivan, Ivan! Water, quickly! It's like her, exactly as she used to<br/>be then, his mother. Spurt some water on him from your mouth,<br/>that's what I used to do to her. He's upset about his mother, his<br/>mother," he muttered to Ivan. "But she was my mother, too, I<br/>believe, his mother. Was she not?" said Ivan, with uncontrolled<br/>anger and contempt. The old man shrank before his flashing eyes.<br/>But something very strange had happened, though only for a second;<br/>it seemed really to have escaped the old man's mind that Alyosha's<br/>mother actually was the mother of Ivan too. "Your mother?" he<br/>muttered, not understanding. "What do you mean? What mother are you<br/>talking about? Was she?… Why, damn it! of course she was yours too!<br/>Damn it! My mind has never been so darkened before. Excuse me, why,<br/>I was thinking Ivan… He he he!" He stopped. A broad, drunken, half<br/>senseless grin overspread his face. At that moment a fearful noise,<br/>and clamour was heard in the hall, there were violent shouts, the<br/>door was flung open, and Dmitri burst into the room. The old man<br/>rushed to Ivan in terror. "He'll kill me! He'll kill me! Don't let<br/>him get at me!" he screamed, clinging to the skirt of Ivan's<br/>coat.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
