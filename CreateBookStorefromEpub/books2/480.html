<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>4<br/>A<br/>Hymn and a Secret<br/><br/><br/>IT was quite late (days are short in November) when Alyosha rang<br/>at the prison gate. It was beginning to get dusk. But Alyosha knew<br/>that he would be admitted without difficulty. Things were managed<br/>in our little town, as everywhere else. At first, of course, on the<br/>conclusion of the preliminary inquiry, relations and a few other<br/>persons could only obtain interviews with Mitya by going through<br/>certain inevitable formalities. But later, though the formalities<br/>were not relaxed, exceptions were made for some, at least, of<br/>Mitya's visitors. So much so, that sometimes the interviews with<br/>the prisoner in the room set aside for the purpose were practically<br/>tete-a-tete.<br/><br/>These exceptions, however, were few in number; only Grushenka,<br/>Alyosha and Rakitin were treated like this. But the captain of the<br/>police, Mihail Mihailovitch, was very favourably disposed to<br/>Grushenka. His abuse of her at Mokroe weighed on the old man's<br/>conscience, and when he learned the whole story, he completely<br/>changed his view of her. And strange to say, though he was firmly<br/>persuaded of his guilt, yet after Mitya was once in prison, the old<br/>man came to take a more and more lenient view of him. "He was a man<br/>of good heart, perhaps," he thought, "who had come to grief from<br/>drinking and dissipation." His first horror had been succeeded by<br/>pity. As for Alyosha, the police captain was very fond of him and<br/>had known him for a long time. Rakitin, who had of late taken to<br/>coming very often to see the prisoner, was one of the most intimate<br/>acquaintances of the "police captain's young ladies," as he called<br/>them, and was always hanging about their house. He gave lessons in<br/>the house of the prison superintendent, too, who, though scrupulous<br/>in the performance of his duties, was a kindhearted old man.<br/>Alyosha, again, had an intimate acquaintance of long standing with<br/>the superintendent, who was fond of talking to him, generally on<br/>sacred subjects. He respected Ivan Fyodorovitch, and stood in awe<br/>of his opinion, though he was a great philosopher himself;<br/>"self-taught," of course. But Alyosha had an irresistible<br/>attraction for him. During the last year the old man had taken to<br/>studying the Apocryphal Gospels, and constantly talked over his<br/>impressions with his young friend. He used to come and see him in<br/>the monastery and discussed for hours together with him and with<br/>the monks. So even if Alyosha were late at the prison, he had only<br/>to go to the superintendent and everything was made easy. Besides,<br/>everyone in the prison, down to the humblest warder, had grown used<br/>to Alyosha. The sentry, of course, did not trouble him so long as<br/>the authorities were satisfied.<br/><br/>When Mitya was summoned from his cell, he always went<br/>downstairs, to the place set aside for interviews. As Alyosha<br/>entered the room he came upon Rakitin, who was just taking leave of<br/>Mitya. They were both talking loudly. Mitya was laughing heartily<br/>as he saw him out, while Rakitin seemed grumbling. Rakitin did not<br/>like meeting Alyosha, especially of late. He scarcely spoke to him,<br/>and bowed to him stiffly. Seeing Alyosha enter now, he frowned and<br/>looked away, as though he were entirely absorbed in buttoning his<br/>big, warm, fur-trimmed overcoat. Then he began looking at once for<br/>his umbrella.<br/><br/>"I must mind not to forget my belongings," he muttered, simply<br/>to say something.<br/><br/>"Mind you don't forget other people's belongings," said Mitya,<br/>as a joke, and laughed at once at his own wit. Rakitin fired up<br/>instantly.<br/><br/>"You'd better give that advice to your own family, who've always<br/>been a slave-driving lot, and not to Rakitin," he cried, suddenly<br/>trembling with anger.<br/><br/>"What's the matter? I was joking," cried Mitya. "Damn it all!<br/>They are all like that." He turned to Alyosha, nodding towards<br/>Rakitin's hurriedly retreating figure. "He was sitting here,<br/>laughing and cheerful, and all at once he boils up like that. He<br/>didn't even nod to you. Have you broken with him completely? Why<br/>are you so late? I've not been simply waiting, but thirsting for<br/>you the whole morning. But never mind. We'll make up for it<br/>now."<br/>
