"Four days, what nonsense! Listen. Did you laugh at me very
much?"

"I didn't laugh at all."

"Why not?"

"Because I believed all you said."

"You are insulting me!"

"Not at all. As soon as I read it, I thought that all that would
come to pass, for as soon as Father Zossima dies, I am to leave the
monastery. Then I shall go back and finish my studies, and when you
reach the legal age we will be married. I shall love you. Though I
haven't had time to think about it, I believe I couldn't find a
better wife than you, and Father Zossima tells me I must
marry."

"But I am a cripple, wheeled about in a chair," laughed Lise,
flushing crimson.

"I'll wheel you about myself, but I'm sure you'll get well by
then."

"But you are mad," said Lise, nervously, "to make all this
nonsense out of a joke! Here's mamma, very a propos, perhaps.
Mamma, how slow you always are, how can you be so long! And here's
Yulia with the ice!

"Oh, Lise, don't scream, above all things don't scream. That
scream drives meâ€¦ How can I help it when you put the lint in
another place? I've been hunting and hunting- I do believe you did
it on purpose."

"But I couldn't tell that he would come with a bad finger, or
else perhaps I might have done it on purpose. My darling mamma, you
begin to say really witty things."
