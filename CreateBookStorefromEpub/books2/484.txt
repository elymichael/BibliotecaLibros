"Has he sent me any message? Come up, Alyosha, and you, Ivan
Fyodorovitch, you must come back, you must. Do you hear?"

There was such a peremptory note in Katya's voice that Ivan,
after a moment's hesitation, made up his mind to go back with
Alyosha.

"She was listening," he murmured angrily to himself, but Alyosha
heard it.

"Excuse my keeping my greatcoat on," said Ivan, going into the
drawing-room. "I won't sit down. I won't stay more than a
minute."

"Sit down, Alexey Fyodorovitch," said Katerina Ivanovna, though
she remained standing. She had changed very little during this
time, but there was an ominous gleam in her dark eyes. Alyosha
remembered afterwards that she had struck him as particularly
handsome at that moment.

"What did he ask you to tell me?"

"Only one thing," said Alyosha, looking her straight in the
face, "that you would spare yourself and say nothing at the trial
of what" (he was a little confused) "… passed between you… at the
time of your first acquaintance… in that town."

"Ah! that I bowed down to the ground for that money!" She broke
into a bitter laugh. "Why, is he afraid for me or for himself? He
asks me to spare- whom? Him or myself? Tell me, Alexey
Fyodorovitch!"

Alyosha watched her intently, trying to understand her.

"Both yourself and him," he answered softly.
