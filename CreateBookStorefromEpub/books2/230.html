<br/>I have mentioned above, that though Father Paissy standing firm<br/>and immovable reading the Gospel over the coffin, could not hear<br/>nor see what was passing outside the cell, he gauged most of it<br/>correctly in his heart, for he knew the men surrounding him well.<br/>He was not shaken by it, but awaited what would come next without<br/>fear, watching with penetration and insight for the outcome of the<br/>general excitement.<br/><br/>Suddenly an extraordinary uproar in the passage in open defiance<br/>of decorum burst on his ears. The door was flung open and Father<br/>Ferapont appeared in the doorway. Behind him there could be seen<br/>accompanying him a crowd of monks, together with many people from<br/>the town. They did not, however, enter the cell, but stood at the<br/>bottom of the steps, waiting to see what Father Ferapont would say<br/>or do. For they felt with a certain awe, in spite of their<br/>audacity, that he had not come for nothing. Standing in the<br/>doorway, Father Ferapont raised his arms, and under his right arm<br/>the keen inquisitive little eyes of the monk from Obdorsk peeped<br/>in. He alone, in his intense curiosity, could not resist running up<br/>the steps after Father Ferapont. The others, on the contrary,<br/>pressed farther back in sudden alarm when the door was noisily<br/>flung open. Holding his hands aloft, Father Ferapont suddenly<br/>roared:<br/><br/>"Casting out I cast out!" and, turning in all directions, he<br/>began at once making the sign of the cross at each of the four<br/>walls and four corners of the cell in succession. All who<br/>accompanied Father Ferapont immediately understood his action. For<br/>they knew he always did this wherever he went, and that he would<br/>not sit down or say a word, till he had driven out the evil<br/>spirits.<br/><br/>"Satan, go hence! Satan, go hence!" he repeated at each sign of<br/>the cross. "Casting out I cast out," he roared again.<br/><br/>He was wearing his coarse gown girt with a rope. His bare chest,<br/>covered with grey hair, could be seen under his hempen shirt. His<br/>feet were bare. As soon as he began waving his arms, the cruel<br/>irons he wore under his gown could be heard clanking.<br/><br/>Father Paissy paused in his reading, stepped forward and stood<br/>before him waiting<br/><br/>"What have you come for, worthy Father? Why do you offend<br/>against good order? Why do you disturb the peace of the flock?" he<br/>said at last, looking sternly at him.<br/><br/>"What have I come for? You ask why? What is your faith?" shouted<br/>Father Ferapont crazily. "I've come here to drive out your<br/>visitors, the unclean devils. I've come to see how many have<br/>gathered here while I have been away. I want to sweep them out with<br/>a birch broom."<br/><br/>"You cast out the evil spirit, but perhaps you are serving him<br/>yourself," Father Paissy went on fearlessly. "And who can say of<br/>himself 'I am holy'? Can you, Father?"<br/><br/>"I am unclean, not holy. I would not sit in an arm-chair and<br/>would not have them bow down to me as an idol," thundered Father<br/>Ferapont. "Nowadays folk destroy the true faith. The dead man, your<br/>saint," he turned to the crowd, pointing with his finger to the<br/>coffin, "did not believe in devils. He gave medicine to keep off<br/>the devils. And so they have become as common as spiders in the<br/>corners. And now he has begun to stink himself. In that we see a<br/>great sign from God."<br/><br/>
