<br/>"Write it down? You want to write that down? Well, write it; I<br/>consent, I give my full consent, gentlemen, only… do you see?…<br/>Stay, stay, write this. Of disorderly conduct I am guilty, of<br/>violence on a poor old man I am guilty. And there is something else<br/>at the bottom of my heart, of which I am guilty, too but that you<br/>need not write down" (he turned suddenly to the secretary); "that's<br/>my personal life, gentlemen, that doesn't concern you, the bottom<br/>of my heart, that's to say… . But of the murder of my old father<br/>I'm not guilty. That's a wild idea. It's quite a wild idea!… I will<br/>prove you that and you'll be convinced directly… . You will laugh,<br/>gentlemen. You'll laugh yourselves at your suspicion!… "<br/><br/>"Be calm, Dmitri Fyodorovitch," said the investigating lawyer<br/>evidently trying to allay Mitya's excitement by his own composure.<br/>"Before we go on with our inquiry, I should like, if you will<br/>consent to answer, to hear you confirm the statement that you<br/>disliked your father, Fyodor Pavlovitch, that you were involved in<br/>continual disputes with him. Here at least, a quarter of an hour<br/>ago, you exclaimed that you wanted to kill him: 'I didn't kill<br/>him,' you said,'but I wanted to kill him.'"<br/><br/>"Did I exclaim that? Ach, that may be so, gentlemen! Yes,<br/>unhappily, I did want to kill him… many times I wanted to…<br/>unhappily, unhappily!"<br/><br/>"You wanted to. Would you consent to explain what motives<br/>precisely led you to such a sentiment of hatred for your<br/>parent?"<br/><br/>"What is there to explain, gentlemen?" Mitya shrugged his<br/>shoulders sullenly, looking down. "I have never concealed my<br/>feelings. All the town knows about it- everyone knows in the<br/>tavern. Only lately I declared them in Father Zossima's cell. And<br/>the very same day, in the evening I beat my father. I nearly killed<br/>him, and I swore I'd come again and kill him, before witnesses… .<br/>Oh, a thousand witnesses! I've been shouting it aloud for the last<br/>month, anyone can tell you that!… The fact stares you in the face,<br/>it speaks for itself, it cries aloud, but feelings, gentlemen,<br/>feelings are another matter. You see, gentlemen"- Mitya frowned-<br/>"it seemed to me that about feelings you've no right to question<br/>me. I know that you are bound by your office, I quite understand<br/>that, but that's my affair, my private, intimate affair, yet… since<br/>I haven't concealed my feelings in the past… in the tavern, for<br/>instance, I've talked to everyone, so… so I won't make a secret of<br/>it now. You see, I understand, gentlemen, that there are terrible<br/>facts against me in this business. I told everyone that I'd kill<br/>him, and now, all of a sudden, he's been killed. So it must have<br/>been me! Ha ha! I can make allowances for you, gentlemen, I can<br/>quite make allowances. I'm struck all of a heap myself, for who can<br/>have murdered him, if not I? That's what it comes to, isn't it? If<br/>not I, who can it be, who? Gentlemen, I want to know, I insist on<br/>knowing!" he exclaimed suddenly. "Where was he murdered? How was he<br/>murdered? How, and with what? Tell me," he asked quickly, looking<br/>at the two lawyers.<br/><br/>"We found him in his study, lying on his back on the floor, with<br/>his head battered in," said the prosecutor.<br/><br/>"That's horrible!" Mitya shuddered and, putting his elbows on<br/>the table, hid his face in his right hand.<br/><br/>"We will continue," interposed Nikolay Parfenovitch. "So what<br/>was it that impelled you to this sentiment of hatred? You have<br/>asserted in public, I believe, that it was based upon<br/>jealousy?"<br/><br/>"Well, yes, jealousy. not only jealousy."<br/><br/>"Disputes about money?"<br/><br/>
