<br/>The little pig says- umph! umph! umph!<br/><br/>The little calf says- moo, moo, moo,<br/><br/>The little duck says- quack, quack, quack,<br/><br/>The little goose says- ga, ga, ga.<br/><br/>The hen goes strutting through the porch;<br/><br/>Troo-roo-roo-roo-roo, she'll say,<br/><br/>Troo-roo-roo-roo-roo, she'll say!<br/><br/>"Give him something, Mitya," said Grushenka. "Give him a<br/>present, he's poor, you know. Ah, the poor, the insulted!… Do you<br/>know, Mitya, I shall go into a nunnery. No, I really shall one day.<br/>Alyosha said something to me to-day that I shall remember all my<br/>life… . Yes… . But to-day let us dance. To-morrow to the nunnery,<br/>but to-day we'll dance. I want to play to-day, good people, and<br/>what of it? God will forgive us. If I were God, I'd forgive<br/>everyone: 'My dear sinners, from this day forth I forgive you.'

"Mitya, don't give me any more wine- if I ask<br/>you, don't give it to me. Wine doesn't give peace. Everything's<br/>going round, the stove, and everything. I want to dance. Let<br/>everyone see how I dance… let them see how beautifully I dance…<br/>"<br/><br/>She really meant it. She pulled a white cambric handkerchief out<br/>of her pocket, and took it by one corner in her right hand, to wave<br/>it in the dance.
