"Forgive me," I said.<br/><br/>Then he was completely aghast.<br/><br/>"Your honourâ€¦ sir, what are you doing? Am I worth it?"<br/><br/>And he burst out crying as I had done before, hid his face in<br/>his hands, turned to the window and shook all over with his sobs. I<br/>flew out to my comrade and jumped into the carriage.<br/><br/>"Ready," I cried. "Have you ever seen a conqueror?" I asked him.<br/>"Here is one before you."<br/><br/>I was in ecstasy, laughing and talking all the way, I don't<br/>remember what about.<br/><br/>He looked at me. "Well, brother, you are a plucky fellow, you'll<br/>keep up the honour of the uniform, I can see."<br/><br/>So we reached the place and found them there, waiting us. We<br/>were placed twelve paces apart; he had the first shot. I stood<br/>gaily, looking him full in the face; I did not twitch an eyelash, I<br/>looked lovingly at him, for I knew what I would do. His shot just<br/>grazed my cheek and ear.<br/><br/>"Thank God," I cried, "no man has been killed," and I seized my<br/>pistol, turned back and flung it far away into the wood. "That's<br/>the place for you," I cried.<br/><br/>I turned to my adversary.<br/><br/>"Forgive me, young fool that I am, sir," I said, "for my<br/>unprovoked insult to you and for forcing you to fire at me. I am<br/>ten times worse than you and more, maybe. Tell that to the person<br/>whom you hold dearest in the world."<br/>
