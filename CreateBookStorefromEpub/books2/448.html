<br/>"In the first place I am capable of thinking for myself without<br/>being taught. Besides, what I said just now about the classics<br/>being translated our teacher Kolbasnikov has said to the whole of<br/>the third class."<br/><br/>"The doctor has come!" cried Nina, who had been silent till<br/>then.<br/><br/>A carriage belonging to Madame Hohlakov drove up to the gate.<br/>The captain, who had been expecting the doctor all the morning,<br/>rushed headlong out to meet him. "Mamma" pulled herself together<br/>and assumed a dignified air. Alyosha went up to Ilusha and began<br/>setting his pillows straight. Nina, from her invalid chair,<br/>anxiously watched him putting the bed tidy. The boys hurriedly took<br/>leave. Some of them promised to come again in the evening. Kolya<br/>called Perezvon and the dog jumped off the bed.<br/><br/>"I won't go away, I won't go away," Kolya said hastily to<br/>Ilusha. "I'll wait in the passage and come back when the doctor's<br/>gone, I'll come back with Perezvon."<br/><br/>But by now the doctor had entered, an important-looking person<br/>with long, dark whiskers and a shiny, shaven chin, wearing a<br/>bearskin coat. As he crossed the threshold he stopped, taken aback;<br/>he probably fancied he had come to the wrong place. "How is this?<br/>Where am I?" he muttered, not removing his coat nor his peaked<br/>sealskin cap. The crowd, the poverty of the room, the washing<br/>hanging on a line in the corner, puzzled him. The captain, bent<br/>double, was bowing low before him.<br/><br/>"It's here, sir, here, sir," he muttered cringingly; "it's here,<br/>you've come right, you were coming to usâ€¦ "<br/><br/>"Sne-gi-ryov?" the doctor said loudly and pompously. "Mr.<br/>Snegiryov- is that you?"<br/><br/>"That's me, sir!"<br/><br/>"Ah!"<br/><br/>The doctor looked round the room with a squeamish air once more<br/>and threw off his coat, displaying to all eyes the grand decoration<br/>at his neck. The captain caught the fur coat in the air, and the<br/>doctor took off his cap.<br/><br/>
