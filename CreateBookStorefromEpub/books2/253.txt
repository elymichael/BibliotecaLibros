that was made wine, and knew not whence it was

(but the servants which drew the water knew);

the governor of the feast called the bridegroom,

"And saith unto him, Every man at the beginning doth

set forth good wine; and when men have well drunk,

that which is worse; but thou hast kept the good wine until
now."

"But what's this, what's this? Why is the room growing wider?…
Ah, yes… It's the marriage, the wedding… yes, of course. Here are
the guests, here are the young couple sitting, and the merry crowd
and… Where is the wise governor of the feast? But who is this? Who?
Again the walls are receding… . Who is getting up there from the
great table? What!… He here, too? But he's in the coffin… but he's
here, too. He has stood up, he sees me, he is coming here… .
God!"…

Yes, he came up to him, to him, he, the little, thin old man,
with tiny wrinkles on his face, joyful and laughing softly. There
was no coffin now, and he was in the same dress as he had worn
yesterday sitting with them, when the visitors had gathered about
him. His face was uncovered, his eyes were shining. How was this,
then? He, too, had been called to the feast. He, too, at the
marriage of Cana in Galilee… .

"Yes, my dear, I am called, too, called and bidden," he heard a
soft voice saying over him. "Why have you hidden yourself here, out
of sight? You come and join us too."

It was his voice, the voice of Father Zossima. And it must be
he, since he called him!

The elder raised Alyosha by the hand and he rose from his
knees.
