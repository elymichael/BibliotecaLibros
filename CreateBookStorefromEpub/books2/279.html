<br/>His father was standing near the window, apparently lost in<br/>thought. Suddenly he jerked up his head, listened a moment, and<br/>hearing nothing went up to the table, poured out half a glass of<br/>brandy from a decanter and drank it off. Then he uttered a deep<br/>sigh, again stood still a moment, walked carelessly up to the<br/>looking-glass on the wall, with his right hand raised the red<br/>bandage on his forehead a little, and began examining his bruises<br/>and scars, which had not yet disappeared.<br/><br/>"He's alone," thought Mitya, "in all probability he's<br/>alone."<br/><br/>Fyodor Pavlovitch moved away from the looking-glass, turned<br/>suddenly to the window and looked out. Mitya instantly slipped away<br/>into the shadow.<br/><br/>"She may be there behind the screen. Perhaps she's asleep by<br/>now," he thought, with a pang at his heart. Fyodor Pavlovitch moved<br/>away from the window. "He's looking for her out of the window, so<br/>she's not there. Why should he stare out into the dark? He's wild<br/>with impatience."… Mitya slipped back at once, and fell to gazing<br/>in at the window again. The old man was sitting down at the table,<br/>apparently disappointed. At last he put his elbow on the table, and<br/>laid his right cheek against his hand. Mitya watched him<br/>eagerly.<br/><br/>"He's alone, he's alone!" he repeated again. "If she were here,<br/>his face would be different."<br/><br/>Strange to say, a queer, irrational vexation rose up in his<br/>heart that she was not here. "It's not that she's not here," he<br/>explained to himself, immediately, "but that I can't tell for<br/>certain whether she is or not." Mitya remembered afterwards that<br/>his mind was at that moment exceptionally clear, that he took in<br/>everything to the slightest detail, and missed no point. But a<br/>feeling of misery, the misery of uncertainty and indecision, was<br/>growing in his heart with every instant. "Is she here or not?" The<br/>angry doubt filled his heart, and suddenly, making up his mind, he<br/>put out his hand and softly knocked on the window frame. He knocked<br/>the signal the old man had agreed upon with Smerdyakov, twice<br/>slowly and then three times more quickly, the signal that meant<br/>"Grushenka is here!"<br/><br/>The old man started, jerked up his head, and, jumping up<br/>quickly, ran to the window. Mitya slipped away into the shadow.<br/>Fyodor Pavlovitch opened the window and thrust his whole head<br/>out.<br/><br/>"Grushenka, is it you? Is it you?" he said, in a sort of<br/>trembling half-whisper. "Where are you, my angel, where are you?"<br/>He was fearfully agitated and breathless.<br/><br/>"He's alone," Mitya decided.<br/><br/>"Where are you?" cried the old man again; and he thrust his head<br/>out farther, thrust it out to the shoulders, gazing in all<br/>directions, right and left. "Come here, I've a little present for<br/>you. Come, I'll show you… "<br/><br/>
