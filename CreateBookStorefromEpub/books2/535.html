<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>2<br/>Dangerous Witnesses<br/><br/><br/>I DO NOT know whether the witnesses for the defence and for the<br/>prosecution were separated into groups by the President, and<br/>whether it was arranged to call them in a certain order. But no<br/>doubt it was so. I only know that the witnesses for the prosecution<br/>were called first. I repeat I don't intend to describe all the<br/>questions step by step. Besides, my account would be to some extent<br/>superfluous, because in the speeches for the prosecution and for<br/>the defence the whole course of the evidence was brought together<br/>and set in a strong and significant light, and I took down parts of<br/>those two remarkable speeches in full, and will quote them in due<br/>course, together with one extraordinary and quite unexpected<br/>episode, which occurred before the final speeches, and undoubtedly<br/>influenced the sinister and fatal outcome of the trial.<br/><br/>I will only observe that from the first moments of the trial one<br/>peculiar characteristic of the case was conspicuous and observed by<br/>all, that is, the overwhelming strength of the prosecution as<br/>compared with the arguments the defence had to rely upon. Everyone<br/>realised it from the first moment that the facts began to group<br/>themselves round a single point, and the whole horrible and bloody<br/>crime was gradually revealed. Everyone, perhaps, felt from the<br/>first that the case was beyond dispute, that there was no doubt<br/>about it, that there could be really no discussion, and that the<br/>defence was only a matter of form, and that the prisoner was<br/>guilty, obviously and conclusively guilty. I imagine that even the<br/>ladies, who were so impatiently longing for the acquittal of the<br/>interesting prisoner, were at the same time, without exception,<br/>convinced of his guilt. What's more, I believe they would have been<br/>mortified if his guilt had not been so firmly established, as that<br/>would have lessened the effect of the closing scene of the<br/>criminal's acquittal. That he would be acquitted, all the ladies,<br/>strange to say, were firmly persuaded up to the very last moment.<br/>"He is guilty, but he will be acquitted, from motives of humanity,<br/>in accordance with the new ideas, the new sentiments that had come<br/>into fashion," and so on, and so on. And that was why they had<br/>crowded into the court so impatiently. The men were more interested<br/>in the contest between the prosecutor and the famous Fetyukovitch.<br/>All were wondering and asking themselves what could even a talent<br/>like Fetyukovitch's make of such a desperate case; and so they<br/>followed his achievements, step by step, with concentrated<br/>attention.<br/><br/>But Fetyukovitch remained an enigma to all up to the very end,<br/>up to his speech. Persons of experience suspected that he had some<br/>design, that he was working towards some object, but it was almost<br/>impossible to guess what it was. His confidence and self-reliance<br/>were unmistakable, however. Everyone noticed with pleasure,<br/>moreover, that he, after so short a stay, not more than three days,<br/>perhaps, among us, had so wonderfully succeeded in mastering the<br/>case and "had studied it to a nicety." People described with<br/>relish, afterwards, how cleverly he had "taken down" all the<br/>witnesses for the prosecution, and as far as possible perplexed<br/>them and, what's more, had aspersed their reputation and so<br/>depreciated the value of their evidence. But it was supposed that<br/>he did this rather by way of sport, so to speak, for professional<br/>glory, to show nothing had been omitted of the accepted methods,<br/>for all were convinced that he could do no real good by such<br/>disparagement of the witnesses, and probably was more aware of this<br/>than anyone, having some idea of his own in the background, some<br/>concealed weapon of defence, which he would suddenly reveal when<br/>the time came. But meanwhile, conscious of his strength, he seemed<br/>to be diverting himself.<br/><br/>So, for instance, when Grigory, Fyodor Pavlovitch's old servant,<br/>who had given the most damning piece of evidence about the open<br/>door, was examined, the counsel for the defence positively fastened<br/>upon him when his turn came to question him. It must be noted that<br/>Grigory entered the trial with a composed and almost stately air,<br/>not the least disconcerted by the majesty of the court or the vast<br/>audience listening to him. He gave evidence with as much confidence<br/>as though he had been talking with his Marfa, only perhaps more<br/>respectfully. It was impossible to make him contradict himself. The<br/>prosecutor questioned him first in detail about the family life of<br/>the Karamazovs. The family picture stood out in lurid colours. It<br/>was plain to ear and eye that the witness was guileless and<br/>impartial. In spite of his profound reverence for the memory of his<br/>deceased master, he yet bore witness that he had been unjust to<br/>Mitya and "hadn't brought up his children as he should. He'd have<br/>been devoured by lice when he was little, if it hadn't been for<br/>me," he added, describing Mitya's early childhood. "It wasn't fair<br/>either of the father to wrong his son over his mother's property,<br/>which was by right his."<br/><br/>In reply to the prosecutor's question what grounds he had for<br/>asserting that Fyodor Pavlovitch had wronged his son in their money<br/>relations, Grigory, to the surprise of everyone, had no proof at<br/>all to bring forward, but he still persisted that the arrangement<br/>with the son was "unfair," and that he ought "to have paid him<br/>several thousand roubles more." I must note, by the way, that the<br/>prosecutor asked this question (whether Fyodor Pavlovitch had<br/>really kept back part of Mitya's inheritance) with marked<br/>persistence of all the witnesses who could be asked it, not<br/>excepting Alyosha and Ivan, but he obtained no exact information<br/>from anyone; all alleged that it was so, but were unable to bring<br/>forward any distinct proof. Grigory's description of the scene at<br/>the dinner-table, when Dmitri had burst in and beaten his father,<br/>threatening to come back to kill him, made a sinister impression on<br/>the court, especially as the old servant's composure in telling it,<br/>his parsimony of words, and peculiar phraseology were as effective<br/>as eloquence. He observed that he was not angry with Mitya for<br/>having knocked him down and struck him on the face; he had forgiven<br/>him long ago, he said. Of the deceased Smerdyakov he observed,<br/>crossing himself, that he was a lad of ability, but stupid and<br/>afflicted, and, worse still, an infidel, and that it was Fyodor<br/>Pavlovitch and his elder son who had taught him to be so. But he<br/>defended Smerdyakov's honesty almost with warmth, and related how<br/>Smerdyakov had once found the master's money in the yard, and,<br/>instead of concealing it, had taken it to his master, who had<br/>rewarded him with a "gold piece" for it, and trusted him implicitly<br/>from that time forward. He maintained obstinately that the door<br/>into the garden had been open. But he was asked so many questions<br/>that I can't recall them all.<br/><br/>At last the counsel for the defence began to cross-examine him,<br/>and the first question he asked was about the envelope in which<br/>Fyodor Pavlovitch was supposed to have put three thousand roubles<br/>for "a certain person." "Have you ever seen it, you, who were for<br/>so many years in close attendance on your master?" Grigory answered<br/>that he had not seen it and had never heard of the money from<br/>anyone "till everybody was talking about it." This question about<br/>the envelope Fetyukovitch put to everyone who could conceivably<br/>have known of it, as persistently as the prosecutor asked his<br/>question about Dmitri's inheritance, and got the same answer from<br/>all, that no one had seen the envelope, though many had heard of<br/>it. From the beginning everyone noticed Fetyukovitch's persistence<br/>on this subject.<br/><br/>"Now, with your permission I'll ask you a question,"<br/>Fetyukovitch said, suddenly and unexpectedly. "Of what was that<br/>balsam, or, rather, decoction, made, which, as we learn from the<br/>preliminary inquiry, you used on that evening to rub your lumbago,<br/>in the hope of curing it?"<br/>
