<br/>"You see? (And how well you expressed it!) Looking at your<br/>father and your brother Mitya to-day you thought of a crime. Then<br/>I'm not mistaken?"<br/><br/>"But wait, wait a minute," Alyosha broke in uneasily, "What has<br/>led you to see all this? Why does it interest you? That's the first<br/>question."<br/><br/>"Two questions, disconnected, but natural. I'll deal with them<br/>separately. What led me to see it? I shouldn't have seen it, if I<br/>hadn't suddenly understood your brother Dmitri, seen right into the<br/>very heart of him all at once. I caught the whole man from one<br/>trait. These very honest but passionate people have a line which<br/>mustn't be crossed. If it were, he'd run at your father with a<br/>knife. But your father's a drunken and abandoned old sinner, who<br/>can never draw the line- if they both themselves go, they'll both<br/>come to grief."<br/><br/>"No, Misha, no. If that's all, you've reassured me. It won't<br/>come to that."<br/><br/>"But why are you trembling? Let me tell you; he may be honest,<br/>our Mitya (he is stupid, but honest), but he's- a sensualist.<br/>That's the very definition and inner essence of him. It's your<br/>father has handed him on his low sensuality. Do you know, I simply<br/>wonder at you, Alyosha, how you can have kept your purity. You're a<br/>Karamazov too, you know! In your family sensuality is carried to a<br/>disease. But now, these three sensualists are watching one another,<br/>with their knives in their belts. The three of them are knocking<br/>their heads together, and you may be the fourth."<br/><br/>"You are mistaken about that woman. Dmitri despises her," said<br/>Alyosha, with a sort of shudder.<br/><br/>"Grushenka? No, brother, he doesn't despise her. Since he has<br/>openly abandoned his betrothed for her, he doesn't despise her.<br/>There's something here, my dear boy, that you don't understand yet.<br/>A man will fall in love with some beauty, with a woman's body, or<br/>even with a part of a woman's body (a sensualist can understand<br/>that), and he'll abandon his own children for her, sell his father<br/>and mother, and his country, Russia, too. If he's honest, he'll<br/>steal; if he's humane, he'll murder; if he's faithful, he'll<br/>deceive. Pushkin, the poet of women's feet, sung of their feet in<br/>his verse. Others don't sing their praises, but they can't look at<br/>their feet without a thrill- and it's not only their feet.<br/>Contempt's no help here, brother, even if he did despise Grushenka.<br/>He does, but he can't tear himself away."<br/><br/>"I understand that," Alyosha jerked out suddenly.<br/><br/>"Really? Well, I dare say you do understand, since you blurt it<br/>out at the first word," said Rakitin, malignantly. "That escaped<br/>you unawares, and the confession's the more precious. So it's a<br/>familiar subject; you've thought about it already, about<br/>sensuality, I mean! Oh, you virgin soul! You're a quiet one,<br/>Alyosha, you're a saint, I know, but the devil only knows what<br/>you've thought about, and what you know already! You are pure, but<br/>you've been down into the depthsâ€¦ . I've been watching you a long<br/>time. You're a Karamazov yourself; you're a thorough Karamazov- no<br/>doubt birth and selection have something to answer for. You're a<br/>sensualist from your father, a crazy saint from your mother. Why do<br/>you tremble? Is it true, then? Do you know, Grushenka has been<br/>begging me to bring you along. 'I'll pull off his cassock,' she<br/>says. You can't think how she keeps begging me to bring you. I<br/>wondered why she took such an interest in you. Do you know, she's<br/>an extraordinary woman, too!"<br/><br/>"Thank her and say I'm not coming," said Alyosha, with a<br/>strained smile. "Finish what you were saying, Misha. I'll tell you.<br/>my idea after."<br/><br/>
