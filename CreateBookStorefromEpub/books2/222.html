"Why are you weeping?" said I, "better rejoice over me, dear<br/>friend, whom I can never forget, for my path is a glad and joyful<br/>one."<br/><br/>He did not say much, but kept sighing and shaking his head over<br/>me tenderly.<br/><br/>"What has become of your fortune?" he asked.<br/><br/>"I gave it to the monastery," I answered; "we live in<br/>common."<br/><br/>After tea I began saying good-bye, and suddenly he brought out<br/>half a rouble as an offering to the monastery, and another<br/>half-rouble I saw him thrusting hurriedly into my hand: "That's for<br/>you in your wanderings, it may be of use to you, Father."<br/><br/>I took his half-rouble, bowed to him and his wife, and went out<br/>rejoicing. And on my way I thought: "Here we are both now, he at<br/>home and I on the road, sighing and shaking our heads, no doubt,<br/>and yet smiling joyfully in the gladness of our hearts, remembering<br/>how God brought about our meeting."<br/><br/>I have never seen him again since then. I had been his master<br/>and he my servant, but now when we exchanged a loving kiss with<br/>softened hearts, there was a great human bond between us. I have<br/>thought a great deal about that, and now what I think is this: Is<br/>it so inconceivable that that grand and simple-hearted unity might<br/>in due time become universal among the Russian people? I believe<br/>that it will come to pass and that the time is at hand.<br/><br/>And of servants I will add this: In old days when I was young I<br/>was often angry with servants; "the cook had served something too<br/>hot, the orderly had not brushed my clothes." But what taught me<br/>better then was a thought of my dear brother's, which I had heard<br/>from him in childhood: "Am I worth it, that another should serve me<br/>and be ordered about by me in his poverty and ignorance?" And I<br/>wondered at the time that such simple and self-evident ideas should<br/>be so slow to occur to our minds.<br/><br/>It is impossible that there should be no servants in the world,<br/>but act so that your servant may be freer in spirit than if he were<br/>not a servant. And why cannot I be a servant to my servant and even<br/>let him see it, and that without any pride on my part or any<br/>mistrust on his? Why should not my servant be like my own kindred,<br/>so that I may take him into my family and rejoice in doing so? Even<br/>now this can be done, but it will lead to the grand unity of men in<br/>the future, when a man will not seek servants for himself, or<br/>desire to turn his fellow creatures into servants as he does now,<br/>but on the contrary, will long with his whole heart to be the<br/>servant of all, as the Gospel teaches.<br/><br/>And can it be a dream, that in the end man will find his joy<br/>only in deeds of light and mercy, and not in cruel pleasures as<br/>now, in gluttony, fornication, ostentation, boasting and envious<br/>rivalry of one with the other? I firmly believe that it is not and<br/>that the time is at hand. People laugh and ask: "When will that<br/>time come and does it look like coming?" I believe that with<br/>Christ's help we shall accomplish this great thing. And how many<br/>ideas there have been on earth in the history of man which were<br/>unthinkable ten years before they appeared! Yet when their destined<br/>hour had come, they came forth and spread over the whole earth. So<br/>it will be with us, and our people will shine forth in the world,<br/>and all men will say: "The stone which the builders rejected has<br/>become the cornerstone of the building."<br/><br/>And we may ask the scornful themselves: If our hope is a dream,<br/>when will you build up your edifice and order things justly by your<br/>intellect alone, without Christ? If they declare that it is they<br/>who are advancing towards unity, only the most simple-hearted among<br/>them believe it, so that one may positively marvel at such<br/>simplicity. Of a truth, they have more fantastic dreams than we.<br/>They aim at justice, but, denying Christ, they will end by flooding<br/>the earth with blood, for blood cries out for blood, and he that<br/>taketh up the sword shall perish by the sword. And if it were not<br/>for Christ's covenant, they would slaughter one another down to the<br/>last two men on earth. And those two last men would not be able to<br/>restrain each other in their pride, and the one would slay the<br/>other and then himself. And that would come to pass, were it not<br/>for the promise of Christ that for the sake of the humble and meek<br/>the days shall be shortened.<br/>
