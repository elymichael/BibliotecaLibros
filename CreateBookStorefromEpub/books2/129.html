<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>3<br/>A<br/>Meeting with the Schoolboys<br/><br/><br/>"THANK goodness he did not ask me about Grushenka," thought<br/>Alyosha, as he left his father's house and turned towards Madame<br/>Hohlakov's, "or I might have had to tell him of my meeting with<br/>Grushenka yesterday."<br/><br/>Alyosha felt painfully that since yesterday both combatants had<br/>renewed their energies, and that their hearts had grown hard again.<br/>"Father is spiteful and angry, he's made some plan and will stick<br/>to it. And what of Dmitri? He too will be harder than yesterday, he<br/>too must be spiteful and angry, and he too, no doubt, has made some<br/>plan. Oh, I must succeed in finding him to-day, whatever<br/>happens."<br/><br/>But Alyosha had not long to meditate. An incident occurred on<br/>the road, which, though apparently of little consequence, made a<br/>great impression on him. just after he had crossed the square and<br/>turned the corner coming out into Mihailovsky Street, which is<br/>divided by a small ditch from the High Street (our whole town is<br/>intersected by ditches), he saw a group of schoolboys between the<br/>ages of nine and twelve, at the bridge. They were going home from<br/>school, some with their bags on their shoulders, others with<br/>leather satchels slung across them, some in short jackets, others<br/>in little overcoats. Some even had those high boots with creases<br/>round the ankles, such as little boys spoilt by rich fathers love<br/>to wear. The whole group was talking eagerly about something,<br/>apparently holding a council. Alyosha had never from his Moscow<br/>days been able to pass children without taking notice of them, and<br/>although he was particularly fond of children of three or<br/>thereabout, he liked schoolboys of ten and eleven too. And so,<br/>anxious as he was to-day, he wanted at once to turn aside to talk<br/>to them. He looked into their excited rosy faces, and noticed at<br/>once that all the boys had stones in their hands. Behind the ditch<br/>some thirty paces away, there was another schoolboy standing by a<br/>fence. He too had a satchel at his side. He was about ten years<br/>old, pale, delicate-looking and with sparkling black eyes. He kept<br/>an attentive and anxious watch on the other six, obviously his<br/>schoolfellows with whom he had just come out of school, but with<br/>whom he had evidently had a feud.<br/><br/>Alyosha went up and, addressing a fair, curly-headed, rosy boy<br/>in a black jacket, observed:<br/><br/>"When I used to wear a satchel like yours, I always used to<br/>carry it on my left side, so as to have my right hand free, but<br/>you've got yours on your right side. So it will be awkward for you<br/>to get at it."<br/><br/>Alyosha had no art or premeditation in beginning with this<br/>practical remark. But it is the only way for a grown-up person to<br/>get at once into confidential relations with a child, or still more<br/>with a group of children. One must begin in a serious, businesslike<br/>way so as to be on a perfectly equal footing. Alyosha understood it<br/>by instinct.<br/><br/>"But he is left-handed," another, a fine healthy-looking boy of<br/>eleven, answered promptly. All the others stared at Alyosha.<br/>
