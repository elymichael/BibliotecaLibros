Ivan felt suddenly angry.<br/><br/>"No, I haven't yet, but I certainly shall. You must explain a<br/>great deal to me, my man; and let me tell you, I am not going to<br/>let you play with me!"<br/><br/>"Why should I play with you, when I put my whole trust in you,<br/>as in God Almighty?" said Smerdyakov, with the same composure, only<br/>for a moment closing his eyes.<br/><br/>"In the first place," began Ivan, "I know that epileptic fits<br/>can't be told beforehand. I've inquired; don't try and take me in.<br/>You can't foretell the day and the hour. How was it you told me the<br/>day and the hour beforehand, and about the cellar, too? How could<br/>you tell that you would fall down the cellar stairs in a fit, if<br/>you didn't sham a fit on purpose?"<br/><br/>"I had to go to the cellar anyway, several times a day, indeed,"<br/>Smerdyakov drawled deliberately. "I fell from the garret just in<br/>the same way a year ago. It's quite true you can't tell the day and<br/>hour of a fit beforehand, but you can always have a presentiment of<br/>it."<br/><br/>"But you did foretell the day and the hour!"<br/><br/>"In regard to my epilepsy, sir, you had much better inquire of<br/>the doctors here. You can ask them whether it was a real fit or a<br/>sham; it's no use my saying any more about it."<br/><br/>"And the cellar? How could you know beforehand of the<br/>cellar?"<br/><br/>"You don't seem able to get over that cellar! As I was going<br/>down to the cellar, I was in terrible dread and doubt. What<br/>frightened me most was losing you and being left without defence in<br/>all the world. So I went down into the cellar thinking, 'Here,<br/>it'll come on directly, it'll strike me down directly, shall I<br/>fall?' And it was through this fear that I suddenly felt the spasm<br/>that always comesâ€¦ and so I went flying. All that and all my<br/>previous conversation with you at the gate the evening before, when<br/>I told you how frightened I was and spoke of the cellar, I told all<br/>that to Doctor Herzenstube and Nikolay Parfenovitch, the<br/>investigating lawyer, and it's all been written down in the<br/>protocol. And the doctor here, Mr. Varvinsky, maintained to all of<br/>them that it was just the thought of it brought it on, the<br/>apprehension that I might fall. It was just then that the fit<br/>seized me. And so they've written it down, that it's just how it<br/>must have happened, simply from my fear."<br/><br/>As he finished, Smerdyakov. drew a deep breath, as though<br/>exhausted.<br/><br/>"Then you have said all that in your evidence?" said Ivan,<br/>somewhat taken aback. He had meant to frighten him with the threat<br/>of repeating their conversation, and it appeared that Smerdyakov<br/>had already reported it all himself.<br/>
