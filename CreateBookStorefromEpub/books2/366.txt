"So no one knew of the signals but your dead father, you, and
the valet Smerdyakov? And no one else?" Nikolay Parfenovitch
inquired once more.

"Yes. The valet Smerdyakov, and Heaven. Write down about Heaven.
That may be of use. Besides, you will need God yourselves."

And they had already of course, begun writing it down. But while
they wrote, the prosecutor said suddenly, as though pitching on a
new idea:

"But if Smerdyakov also knew of these signals and you absolutely
deny all responsibility for the death of your father, was it not
he, perhaps, who knocked the signal agreed upon, induced your
father to open to him, and thenâ€¦ committed the crime?"

Mitya turned upon him a look of profound irony and intense
hatred. His silent stare lasted so long that it made the prosecutor
blink.

"You've caught the fox again," commented Mitya at last; "you've
got the beast by the tail. Ha ha! I see through you, Mr.
Prosecutor. You thought, of course, that I should jump at that,
catch at your prompting, and shout with all my might, 'Aie! it's
Smerdyakov; he's the murderer.' Confess that's what you thought.
Confess, and I'll go on."

But the prosecutor did not confess. He held his tongue and
waited.

"You're mistaken. I'm not going to shout, 'It's Smerdyakov,'"
said Mitya.

"And you don't even suspect him?"

"Why, do you suspect him?"
