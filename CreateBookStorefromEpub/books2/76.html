<br/>"'Four thousand! What do you mean? I was joking. You've been<br/>counting your chickens too easily, madam. Two hundred, if you like,<br/>with all my heart. But four thousand is not a sum to throw away on<br/>such frivolity. You've put yourself out to no purpose.'<br/><br/>"I should have lost the game, of course. She'd have run away.<br/>But it would have been an infernal revenge. It would have been<br/>worth it all. I'd have howled with regret all the rest of my life,<br/>only to have played that trick. Would you believe it, it has never<br/>happened to me with any other woman, not one, to look at her at<br/>such a moment with hatred. But, on my oath, I looked at her for<br/>three seconds, or five perhaps, with fearful hatred- that hate<br/>which is only a hair's-breadth from love, from the maddest<br/>love!<br/><br/>"I went to the window, put my forehead against the frozen pane,<br/>and I remember the ice burnt my forehead like fire. I did not keep<br/>her long, don't be afraid. I turned round, went up to the table,<br/>opened the drawer and took out a banknote for five thousand roubles<br/>(it was lying in a French dictionary). Then I showed it her in<br/>silence, folded it, handed it to her, opened the door into the<br/>passage, and, stepping back, made her a deep bow. a most<br/>respectful, a most impressive bow, believe me! She shuddered all<br/>over, gazed at me for a second, turned horribly pale-white as a<br/>sheet, in fact- and all at once, not impetuously but softly,<br/>gently, bowed down to my feet- not a boarding-school curtsey, but a<br/>Russian bow, with her forehead to the floor. She jumped up and ran<br/>away. I was wearing my sword. I drew it and nearly stabbed myself<br/>with it on the spot; why, I don't know. It would have been<br/>frightfully stupid, of course. I suppose it was from delight. Can<br/>you understand that one might kill oneself from delight? But I<br/>didn't stab myself. I only kissed my sword and put it back in the<br/>scabbard- which there was no need to have told you, by the way. And<br/>I fancy that in telling you about my inner conflict I have laid it<br/>on rather thick to glorify myself. But let it pass, and to hell<br/>with all who pry into the human heart! Well, so much for that<br/>'adventure' with Katerina Ivanovna. So now Ivan knows of it, and<br/>you- no one else."<br/><br/>Dmitri got up, took a step or two in his excitement, pulled out<br/>his handkerchief and mopped his forehead, then sat down again, not<br/>in the same place as before, but on the opposite side, so that<br/>Alyosha had to turn quite round to face him.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
