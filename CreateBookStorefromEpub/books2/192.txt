"I am going away to Moscow to-morrow, if you care to know- early
to-morrow morning. That's all!" he suddenly said aloud angrily, and
wondered himself afterwards what need there was to say this then to
Smerdyakov.

"That's the best thing you can do," he responded, as though he
had expected to hear it; "except that you can always be telegraphed
for from Moscow, if anything should happen here."

Ivan stopped again, and again turned quickly to Smerdyakov. But
a change had passed over him, too. All his familiarity and
carelessnes had completely disappeared. His face expressed
attention and expectation, intent but timid and cringing.

"Haven't you something more to say- something to add?" could be
read in the intent gaze he fixed on Ivan.

"And couldn't I be sent for from Tchermashnya, too- in case
anything happened?" Ivan shouted suddenly, for some unknown reason
raising his voice.

"From Tchermashnya, too… you could be sent for," Smerdyakov
muttered, almost in a whisper, looking disconcerted, but gazing
intently into Ivan's eyes.

"Only Moscow is farther and Tchermashnya is nearer. Is it to
save my spending money on the fare, or to save my going so far out
of my way, that you insist on Tchermashnya?"

"Precisely so… " muttered Smerdyakov, with a breaking voice. He
looked at Ivan with a revolting smile, and again made ready to draw
back. But to his astonishment Ivan broke into a laugh, and went
through the gate still laughing. Anyone who had seen his face at
that moment would have known that he was not laughing from
lightness of heart, and he could not have explained himself what he
was feeling at that instant. He moved and walked as though in a
nervous frenzy.
