"He has sent for me," she cried, her face white and distorted,<br/>with a wan smile; "he whistles! Crawl back, little dog!"<br/><br/>But only for one instant she stood as though hesitating;<br/>suddenly the blood rushed to her head and sent a glow to her<br/>cheeks.<br/><br/>"I will go," she cried; "five years of my life! Good-bye!<br/>Good-bye, Alyosha, my fate is sealed. Go, go, leave me all of you,<br/>don't let me see you again! Grushenka is flying to a new lifeâ€¦ .<br/>Don't you remember evil against me either, Rakitin. I may be going<br/>to my death! Ugh! I feel as though I were drunk!"<br/><br/>She suddenly left them and ran into her bedroom.<br/><br/>"Well, she has no thoughts for us now!" grumbled Rakitin. "Let's<br/>go, or we may hear that feminine shriek again. I am sick of all<br/>these tears and cries."<br/><br/>Alyosha mechanically let himself be led out. In the yard stood a<br/>covered cart. Horses were being taken out of the shafts, men were<br/>running to and fro with a lantern. Three fresh horses were being<br/>led in at the open gate. But when Alyosha and Rakitin reached the<br/>bottom of the steps, Grushenka's bedroom window was suddenly opened<br/>and she called in a ringing voice after Alyosha:<br/><br/>"Alyosha, give my greetings to your brother Mitya and tell him<br/>not to remember evil against me, though I have brought him misery.<br/>And tell him, too, in my words: 'Grushenka has fallen to a<br/>scoundrel, and not to you, noble heart.' And add, too, that<br/>Grushenka loved him only one hour, only one short hour she loved<br/>him- so let him remember that hour all his life-say, 'Grushenka<br/>tells you to!'<br/><br/>She ended in a voice full of sobs. The window was shut with a<br/>slam.<br/><br/>"H'm, h'm!" growled Rakitin, laughing, "she murders your brother<br/>Mitya and then tells him to remember it all his life! What<br/>ferocity!"<br/><br/>Alyosha made no reply, he seemed not to have heard. He walked<br/>fast beside Rakitin as though in a terrible hurry. He was lost in<br/>thought and moved mechanically. Rakitin felt a sudden twinge as<br/>though he had been touched on an open wound. He had expected<br/>something quite different by bringing Grushenka and Alyosha<br/>together. Something very different from what he had hoped for had<br/>happened.<br/><br/>"He is a Pole, that officer of hers," he began again,<br/>restraining himself; "and indeed he is not an officer at all now.<br/>He served in the customs in Siberia, somewhere on the Chinese<br/>frontier, some puny little beggar of a Pole, I expect. Lost his<br/>job, they say. He's heard now that Grushenka's saved a little<br/>money, so he's turned up again- that's the explanation of the<br/>mystery."<br/>
