"Come, I say, for my own amusement! You don't play horses, do
you?"

"But you must look at it like this," said Alyosha, smiling.
"Grown-up people go to the theatre and there the adventures of all
sorts of heroes are represented- sometimes there are robbers and
battles, too- and isn't that just the same thing, in a different
form, of course? And young people's games of soldiers or robbers in
their playtime are also art in its first stage. You know, they
spring from the growing artistic instincts of the young. And
sometimes these games are much better than performances in the
theatre; the only difference is that people go there to look at the
actors, while in these games the young people are the actors
themselves. But that's only natural."

"You think so? Is that your idea?" Kolya looked at him intently.
"Oh, you know, that's rather an interesting view. When I go home,
I'll think it over. I'll admit I thought I might learn something
from you. I've come to learn of you, Karamazov," Kolya concluded,
in a voice full of spontaneous feeling.

"And I of you," said Alyosha, smiling and pressing his hand.

Kolya was much pleased with Alyosha. What struck him most was
that he treated him exactly like an equal and that he talked to him
just as if he were "quite grown up."

"I'll show you something directly, Karamazov; it's a theatrical
performance, too," he said, laughing nervously. "That's why I've
come."

"Let us go first to the people of the house, on the left. All
the boys leave their coats in there, because the room is small and
hot."

"Oh, I'm only coming in for a minute. I'll keep on my overcoat.
Perezvon will stay here in the passage and be dead. Ici, Perezvon,
lie down and be dead! You see how he's dead. I'll go in first and
explore, then I'll whistle to him when I think fit, and you'll see,
he'll dash in like mad. Only Smurov must not forget to open the
door at the moment. I'll arrange it all and you'll see
something."
