<br/>"He keeps talking nonsense, and we were all laughing," Kalgonov<br/>began suddenly, as though divining his thought, and pointing to<br/>Maximov.<br/><br/>Mitya immediately stared at Kalgonov and then at Maximov<br/><br/>"He's talking nonsense?" he laughed, his short, wooden laugh,<br/>seeming suddenly delighted at something- "ha ha!"<br/><br/>"Yes. Would you believe it, he will have it that all our cavalry<br/>officers in the twenties married Polish women. That's awful rot,<br/>isn't it?"<br/><br/>"Polish women?" repeated Mitya, perfectly ecstatic.<br/><br/>Kalgonov was well aware of Mitya's attitude to Grushenka, and he<br/>guessed about the Pole, too, but that did not so much interest him,<br/>perhaps did not interest him at all; what he was interested in was<br/>Maximov. He had come here with Maximov by chance, and he met the<br/>Poles here at the inn for the first time in his life. Grushenka he<br/>knew before, and had once been with someone to see her; but she had<br/>not taken to him. But here she looked at him very affectionately:<br/>before Mitya's arrival, she had been making much of him, but he<br/>seemed somehow to be unmoved by it. He was a boy, not over twenty,<br/>dressed like a dandy, with a very charming fair-skinned face, and<br/>splendid thick, fair hair. From his fair face looked out beautiful<br/>pale blue eyes, with an intelligent and sometimes even deep<br/>expression, beyond his age indeed, although the young man sometimes<br/>looked and talked quite like a child, and was not at all ashamed of<br/>it, even when he was aware of it himself. As a rule he was very<br/>wilful, even capricious, though always friendly. Sometimes there<br/>was something fixed and obstinate in his expression. He would look<br/>at you and listen, seeming all the while to be persistently<br/>dreaming over something else. Often he was listless and lazy; at<br/>other times he would grow excited, sometimes, apparently, over the<br/>most trivial matters.<br/><br/>"Only imagine, I've been taking him about with me for the last<br/>four days," he went on, indolently drawling his words, quite<br/>naturally though, without the slightest affectation. "Ever since<br/>your brother, do you remember, shoved him off the carriage and sent<br/>him flying. That made me take an interest in him at the time, and I<br/>took him into the country, but he keeps talking such rot I'm<br/>ashamed to be with him. I'm taking him back."<br/><br/>"The gentleman has not seen Polish ladies, and says what is<br/>impossible," the Pole with the pipe observed to Maximov.<br/><br/>He spoke Russian fairly well, much better, anyway, than he<br/>pretended. If he used Russian words, he always distorted them into<br/>a Polish form.<br/><br/>"But I was married to a Polish lady myself," tittered<br/>Maximov.<br/><br/>
