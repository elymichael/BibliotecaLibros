This was unmistakably said with some malice and obviously with
intention; even perhaps with no desire to conceal that he spoke
ironically and with intention.

"Oh, dear, how mistaken it all is!" Madame Hohlakov cried
again.

"Alexey Fyodorovitch, you speak. I want dreadfully to know what
you will say!" cried Katerina Ivanovna, and burst into tears.
Alyosha got up from the sofa.

"It's nothing, nothing!" she went on through her tears. "I'm
upset, I didn't sleep last night. But by the side of two such
friends as you and your brother I still feel strong- for I know you
two will never desert me."

"Unluckily I am obliged to return to Moscow- perhaps to-morrow-
and to leave you for a long time- and, unluckily, it's
unavoidable," Ivan said suddenly.

"To-morrow- to Moscow!" her face was suddenly contorted; "but-
but, dear me, how fortunate!" she cried in a voice suddenly
changed. In one instant there was no trace left of her tears. She
underwent an instantaneous transformation, which amazed Alyosha.
Instead of a poor, insulted girl, weeping in a sort of
"laceration," he saw a woman completely self-possessed and even
exceedingly pleased, as though something agreeable had just
happened.

"Oh, not fortunate that I am losing you, of course not," she
collected herself suddenly, with a charming society smile. "Such a
friend as you are could not suppose that. I am only too unhappy at
losing you." She rushed impulsively at Ivan, and seizing both his
hands, pressed them warmly. "But what is fortunate is that you will
be able in Moscow to see auntie and Agafya and to tell them all the
horror of my present position. You can speak with complete openness
to Agafya, but spare dear auntie. You will know how to do that. You
can't think how wretched I was yesterday and this morning,
wondering how I could write them that dreadful letter- for one can
never tell such things in a letter… Now it will be easy for me to
write, for you will see them and explain everything. Oh, how glad I
am! But I am only glad of that, believe me. Of course, no one can
take your place… . I will run at once to write the letter," she
finished suddenly, and took a step as though to go out of the
room.

"And what about Alyosha and his opinion, which you were so
desperately anxious to hear?" cried Madame Hohlakov. There was a
sarcastic, angry note in her voice.

"I had not forgotten that," cried Katerina Ivanovna, coming to a
sudden standstill, "and why are you so antagonistic at such a
moment?" she added, with warm and bitter reproachfulness. "What I
said, I repeat. I must have his opinion. More than that, I must
have his decision! As he says, so it shall be. You see how anxious
I am for your words, Alexey Fyodorovitch… But what's the
matter?"

"I couldn't have believed it. I can't understand it!" Alyosha
cried suddenly in distress.

"He is going to Moscow, and you cry out that you are glad. You
said that on purpose! And you begin explaining that you are not
glad of that but sorry to be- losing a friend. But that was acting,
too- you were playing a part as in a theatre!"
