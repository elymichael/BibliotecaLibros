<br/>"One may say with certainty, gentlemen of the jury," the<br/>prosecutor continued, "that outraged nature and the criminal heart<br/>bring their own vengeance more completely than any earthly justice.<br/>What's more, justice and punishment on earth positively alleviate<br/>the punishment of nature and are, indeed, essential to the soul of<br/>the criminal at such moments, as its salvation from despair. For I<br/>cannot imagine the horror and moral suffering of Karamazov when he<br/>learnt that she loved him, that for his sake she had rejected her<br/>first lover, that she was summoning him, Mitya, to a new life, that<br/>she was promising him happiness- and when? When everything was over<br/>for him and nothing was possible!<br/><br/>"By the way, I will note in parenthesis a point of importance<br/>for the light it throws on the prisoner's position at the moment.<br/>This woman, this love of his, had been till the last moment, till<br/>the very instant of his arrest, a being unattainable, passionately<br/>desired by him but unattainable. Yet why did he not shoot himself<br/>then, why did he relinquish his design and even forget where his<br/>pistol was? It was just that passionate desire for love and the<br/>hope of satisfying it that restrained him. Throughout their revels<br/>he kept close to his adored mistress, who was at the banquet with<br/>him and was more charming and fascinating to him than ever- he did<br/>not leave her side, abasing himself in his homage before her.<br/><br/>"His passion might well, for a moment, stifle not only the fear<br/>of arrest, but even the torments of conscience. For a moment, oh,<br/>only for a moment! I can picture the state of mind of the criminal<br/>hopelessly enslaved by these influences- first, the influence of<br/>drink, of noise and excitement, of the thud of the dance and the<br/>scream of the song, and of her, flushed with wine, singing and<br/>dancing and laughing to him! Secondly, the hope in the background<br/>that the fatal end might still be far off, that not till next<br/>morning, at least, they would come and take him. So he had a few<br/>hours and that's much, very much! In a few hours one can think of<br/>many things. I imagine that he felt something like what criminals<br/>feel when they are being taken to the scaffold. They have another<br/>long, long street to pass down and at walking pace, past thousands<br/>of people. Then there will be a turning into another street and<br/>only at the end of that street the dread place of execution! I<br/>fancy that at the beginning of the journey the condemned man,<br/>sitting on his shameful cart, must feel that he has infinite life<br/>still before him. The houses recede, the cart moves on- oh, that's<br/>nothing, it's still far to the turning into the second street and<br/>he still looks boldly to right and to left at those thousands of<br/>callously curious people with their eyes fixed on him, and he still<br/>fancies that he is just such a man as they. But now the turning<br/>comes to the next street. Oh, that's nothing, nothing, there's<br/>still a whole street before him, and however many houses have been<br/>passed, he will still think there are many left. And so to the very<br/>end, to the very scaffold.<br/><br/>"This I imagine is how it was with Karamazov then. 'They've not<br/>had time yet,' he must have thought, 'I may still find some way<br/>out, oh, there's still time to make some plan of defence, and now,<br/>now- she is so fascinating!'<br/><br/>"His soul was full of confusion and dread, but he managed,<br/>however, to put aside half his money and hide it somewhere- I<br/>cannot otherwise explain the disappearance of quite half of the<br/>three thousand he had just taken from his father's pillow. He had<br/>been in Mokroe more than once before, he had caroused there for two<br/>days together already, he knew the old big house with all its<br/>passages and outbuildings. I imagine that part of the money was<br/>hidden in that house, not long before the arrest, in some crevice,<br/>under some floor, in some corner, under the roof. With what object?<br/>I shall be asked. Why, the catastrophe may take place at once, of<br/>course; he hadn't yet considered how to meet it, he hadn't the<br/>time, his head was throbbing and his heart was with her, but money-<br/>money was indispensable in any case! With money a man is always a<br/>man. Perhaps such foresight at such a moment may strike you as<br/>unnatural? But he assures us himself that a month before, at a<br/>critical and exciting moment, he had halved his money and sewn it<br/>up in a little bag. And though that was not true, as we shall prove<br/>directly, it shows the idea was a familiar one to Karamazov, he had<br/>contemplated it. What's more, when he declared at the inquiry that<br/>he had put fifteen hundred roubles in a bag (which never existed)<br/>he may have invented that little bag on the inspiration of the<br/>moment, because he had two hours before divided his money and<br/>hidden half of it at Mokroe till morning, in case of emergency,<br/>simply not to have it on himself. Two extremes, gentlemen of the<br/>jury, remember that Karamazov can contemplate two extremes and both<br/>at once.<br/><br/>"We have looked in the house, but we haven't found the money. It<br/>may still be there or it may have disappeared next day and be in<br/>the prisoner's hands now. In any case he was at her side, on his<br/>knees before her, she was lying on the bed, he had his hands<br/>stretched out to her and he had so entirely forgotten everything<br/>that he did not even hear the men coming to arrest him. He hadn't<br/>time to prepare any line of defence in his mind. He was caught<br/>unawares and confronted with his judges, the arbiters of his<br/>destiny.<br/><br/>"Gentlemen of the jury, there are moments in the execution of<br/>our duties when it is terrible for us to face a man, terrible on<br/>his account, too! The moments of contemplating that animal fear,<br/>when the criminal sees that all is lost, but still struggles, still<br/>means to struggle, the moments when every instinct of<br/>self-preservation rises up in him at once and he looks at you with<br/>questioning and suffering eyes, studies you, your face, your<br/>thoughts, uncertain on which side you will strike, and his<br/>distracted mind frames thousands of plans in an instant, but he is<br/>still afraid to speak, afraid of giving himself away! This<br/>purgatory of the spirit, this animal thirst for self-preservation,<br/>these humiliating moments of the human soul, are awful, and<br/>sometimes arouse horror and compassion for the criminal even in the<br/>lawyer. And this was what we all witnessed then.<br/><br/>"At first he was thunderstruck and in his terror dropped some<br/>very compromising phrases. 'Blood! I've deserved it!' But he<br/>quickly restrained himself. He had not prepared what he was to say,<br/>what answer he was to make, he had nothing but a bare denial ready.<br/>'I am not guilty of my father's death.' That was his fence for the<br/>moment and behind it he hoped to throw up a barricade of some sort.<br/>His first compromising exclamations he hastened to explain by<br/>declaring that he was responsible for the death of the servant<br/>Grigory only. 'Of that bloodshed I am guilty, but who has killed my<br/>father, gentlemen, who has killed him? Who can have killed him, if<br/>not I?' Do you hear, he asked us that, us, who had come to ask him<br/>that question! Do you hear that uttered with such premature haste-<br/>'if not I'- the animal cunning, the naivete the Karamazov<br/>impatience of it? 'I didn't kill him and you mustn't think I did! I<br/>wanted to kill him, gentlemen, I wanted to kill him,' he hastens to<br/>admit (he was in a hurry, in a terrible hurry), 'but still I am not<br/>guilty, it is not I murdered him.' He concedes to us that he wanted<br/>to murder him, as though to say, you can see for yourselves how<br/>truthful I am, so you'll believe all the sooner that I didn't<br/>murder him. Oh, in such cases the criminal is often amazingly<br/>shallow and credulous.<br/><br/>"At that point one of the lawyers asked him, as it were<br/>incidentally, the most simple question, 'Wasn't it Smerdyakov<br/>killed him?' Then, as we expected, he was horribly angry at our<br/>having anticipated him and caught him unawares, before he had time<br/>to pave the way to choose and snatch the moment when it would be<br/>most natural to bring in Smerdyakov's name. He rushed at once to<br/>the other extreme, as he always does, and began to assure us that<br/>Smerdyakov could not have killed him, was not capable of it. But<br/>don't believe him, that was only his cunning; he didn't really give<br/>up the idea of Smerdyakov; on the contrary, he meant to bring him<br/>forward again; for, indeed, he had no one else to bring forward,<br/>but he would do that later, because for the moment that line was<br/>spoiled for him. He would bring him forward perhaps next day, or<br/>even a few days later, choosing an opportunity to cry out to us,<br/>'You know I was more sceptical about Smerdyakov than you, you<br/>remember that yourselves, but now I am convinced. He killed him, he<br/>must have done!' And for the present he falls back upon a gloomy<br/>and irritable denial. Impatience and anger prompted him, however,<br/>to the most inept and incredible explanation of how he looked into<br/>his father's window and how he respectfully withdrew. The worst of<br/>it was that he was unaware of the position of affairs, of the<br/>evidence given by Grigory.<br/><br/>"We proceeded to search him. The search angered, but encouraged<br/>him, the whole three thousand had not been found on him, only half<br/>of it. And no doubt only at that moment of angry silence, the<br/>fiction of the little bag first occurred to him. No doubt he was<br/>conscious himself of the improbability of the story and strove<br/>painfully to make it sound more likely, to weave it into a romance<br/>that would sound plausible. In such cases the first duty, the chief<br/>task of the investigating lawyers, is to prevent the criminal being<br/>prepared, to pounce upon him unexpectedly so that he may blurt out<br/>his cherished ideas in all their simplicity, improbability and<br/>inconsistency. The criminal can only be made to speak by the sudden<br/>and apparently incidental communication of some new fact, of some<br/>circumstance of great importance in the case, of which he had no<br/>previous idea and could not have foreseen. We had such a fact in<br/>readiness- that was Grigory's evidence about the open door through<br/>which the prisoner had run out. He had completely forgotten about<br/>that door and had not even suspected that Grigory could have seen<br/>it.<br/><br/>
