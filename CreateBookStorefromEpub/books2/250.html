But you are not Christ, you know, and I am<br/>not Judas."<br/><br/>"Oh, Rakitin, I assure you I'd forgotten about it," cried<br/>Alyosha, "you remind me of it yourselfâ€¦ "<br/><br/>But this was the last straw for Rakitin.<br/><br/>"Damnation take you all and each of you" he cried suddenly, "why<br/>the devil did I take you up?
