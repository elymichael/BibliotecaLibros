"So you'll hit a man from behind! They tell the truth, then,<br/>when they say that you attack on the sly," said Alyosha, turning<br/>round again. This time the boy threw a stone savagely right into<br/>Alyosha's face; but Alyosha just had time to guard himself, and the<br/>stone struck him on the elbow.<br/><br/>"Aren't you ashamed? What have I done to you?" he cried.<br/><br/>The boy waited in silent defiance, certain that now Alyosha<br/>would attack him. Seeing that even now he would not, his rage was<br/>like a little wild beast's; he flew at Alyosha himself, and before<br/>Alyosha had time to move, the spiteful child had seized his left<br/>hand with both of his and bit his middle finger. He fixed his teeth<br/>in it and it was ten seconds before he let go. Alyosha cried out<br/>with pain and pulled his finger away with all his might. The child<br/>let go at last and retreated to his former distance. Alyosha's<br/>finger had been badly bitten to the bone, close to the nail; it<br/>began to bleed. Alyosha took out his handkerchief and bound it<br/>tightly round his injured hand. He was a full minute bandaging it.<br/>The boy stood waiting all the time. At last Alyosha raised his<br/>gentle eyes and looked at him.<br/><br/>"Very well," he said, "You see how badly you've bitten me.<br/>That's enough, isn't it? Now tell me, what have I done to you?"<br/><br/>The boy stared in amazement.<br/><br/>"Though I don't know you and it's the first time I've seen you,"<br/>Alyosha went on with the same serenity, "yet I must have done<br/>something to you- you wouldn't have hurt me like this for nothing.<br/>So what have I done? How have I wronged you, tell me?"<br/><br/>Instead of answering, the boy broke into a loud tearful wail and<br/>ran away. Alyosha walked slowly after him towards Mihailovsky<br/>Street, and for a long time he saw the child running in the<br/>distance as fast as ever, not turning his head and no doubt still<br/>keeping up his tearful wail. He made up his mind to find him out as<br/>soon as he had time, and to solve this mystery. just now he had not<br/>the time.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
