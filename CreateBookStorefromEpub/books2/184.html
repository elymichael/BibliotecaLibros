"Take it as the last," said Ivan, laughing, "if you are so<br/>corrupted by modern realism and can't stand anything fantastic. If<br/>you like it to be a case of mistaken identity, let it be so. It is<br/>true," he went on, laughing, "the old man was ninety, and he might<br/>well be crazy over his set idea. He might have been struck by the<br/>appearance of the Prisoner. It might, in fact, be simply his<br/>ravings, the delusion of an old man of ninety, over-excited by the<br/>auto da fe of a hundred heretics the day before. But does it matter<br/>to us after all whether it was a mistake of identity or a wild<br/>fantasy? All that matters is that the old man should speak out,<br/>that he should speak openly of what he has thought in silence for<br/>ninety years."<br/><br/>"And the Prisoner too is silent? Does He look at him and not say<br/>a word?"<br/><br/>"That's inevitable in any case," Ivan laughed again. "The old<br/>man has told Him He hasn't the right to add anything to what He has<br/>said of old. One may say it is the most fundamental feature of<br/>Roman Catholicism, in my opinion at least. 'All has been given by<br/>Thee to the Pope,' they say, 'and all, therefore, is still in the<br/>Pope's hands, and there is no need for Thee to come now at all.<br/>Thou must not meddle for the time, at least.' That's how they speak<br/>and write too- the Jesuits, at any rate. I have read it myself in<br/>the works of their theologians. 'Hast Thou the right to reveal to<br/>us one of the mysteries of that world from which Thou hast come?'<br/>my old man asks Him, and answers the question for Him. 'No, Thou<br/>hast not; that Thou mayest not add to what has been said of old,<br/>and mayest not take from men the freedom which Thou didst exalt<br/>when Thou wast on earth. Whatsoever Thou revealest anew will<br/>encroach on men's freedom of faith; for it will be manifest as a<br/>miracle, and the freedom of their faith was dearer to Thee than<br/>anything in those days fifteen hundred years ago. Didst Thou not<br/>often say then, "I will make you free"? But now Thou hast seen<br/>these "free" men,' the old man adds suddenly, with a pensive smile.<br/>'Yes, we've paid dearly for it,' he goes on, looking sternly at<br/>Him, 'but at last we have completed that work in Thy name. For<br/>fifteen centuries we have been wrestling with Thy freedom, but now<br/>it is ended and over for good. Dost Thou not believe that it's over<br/>for good? Thou lookest meekly at me and deignest not even to be<br/>wroth with me. But let me tell Thee that now, to-day, people are<br/>more persuaded than ever that they have perfect freedom, yet they<br/>have brought their freedom to us and laid it humbly at our feet.<br/>But that has been our doing. Was this what Thou didst? Was this Thy<br/>freedom?'"<br/><br/>"I don't understand again." Alyosha broke in. "Is he ironical,<br/>is he jesting?"<br/><br/>"Not a bit of it! He claims it as a merit for himself and his<br/>Church that at last they have vanquished freedom and have done so<br/>to make men happy. 'For now' (he is speaking of the Inquisition, of<br/>course) 'for the first time it has become possible to think of the<br/>happiness of men. Man was created a rebel; and how can rebels be<br/>happy? Thou wast warned,' he says to Him. 'Thou hast had no lack of<br/>admonitions and warnings, but Thou didst not listen to those<br/>warnings; Thou didst reject the only way by which men might be made<br/>happy. But, fortunately, departing Thou didst hand on the work to<br/>us. Thou hast promised, Thou hast established by Thy word, Thou<br/>hast given to us the right to bind and to unbind, and now, of<br/>course, Thou canst not think of taking it away. Why, then, hast<br/>Thou come to hinder us?'"<br/><br/>"And what's the meaning of 'no lack of admonitions and<br/>warnings'?" asked Alyosha.<br/><br/>"Why, that's the chief part of what the old man must say.<br/><br/>"'The wise and dread spirit, the spirit of self-destruction and<br/>non-existence,' the old man goes on, great spirit talked with Thee<br/>in the wilderness, and we are told in the books that he "tempted"<br/>Thee. Is that so? And could anything truer be said than what he<br/>revealed to Thee in three questions and what Thou didst reject, and<br/>what in the books is called "the temptation"? And yet if there has<br/>ever been on earth a real stupendous miracle, it took place on that<br/>day, on the day of the three temptations. The statement of those<br/>three questions was itself the miracle. If it were possible to<br/>imagine simply for the sake of argument that those three questions<br/>of the dread spirit had perished utterly from the books, and that<br/>we had to restore them and to invent them anew, and to do so had<br/>gathered together all the wise men of the earth- rulers, chief<br/>priests, learned men, philosophers, poets- and had set them the<br/>task to invent three questions, such as would not only fit the<br/>occasion, but express in three words, three human phrases, the<br/>whole future history of the world and of humanity- dost Thou<br/>believe that all the wisdom of the earth united could have invented<br/>anything in depth and force equal to the three questions which were<br/>actually put to Thee then by the wise and mighty spirit in the<br/>wilderness? From those questions alone, from the miracle of their<br/>statement, we can see that we have here to do not with the fleeting<br/>human intelligence, but with the absolute and eternal. For in those<br/>three questions the whole subsequent history of mankind is, as it<br/>were, brought together into one whole, and foretold, and in them<br/>are united all the unsolved historical contradictions of human<br/>nature. At the time it could not be so clear, since the future was<br/>unknown; but now that fifteen hundred years have passed, we see<br/>that everything in those three questions was so justly divined and<br/>foretold, and has been so truly fulfilled, that nothing can be<br/>added to them or taken from them.<br/><br/>"Judge Thyself who was right- Thou or he who questioned Thee<br/>then? Remember the first question; its meaning, in other words, was<br/>this: "Thou wouldst go into the world, and art going with empty<br/>hands, with some promise of freedom which men in their simplicity<br/>and their natural unruliness cannot even understand, which they<br/>fear and dread- for nothing has ever been more insupportable for a<br/>man and a human society than freedom. But seest Thou these stones<br/>in this parched and barren wilderness? Turn them into bread, and<br/>mankind will run after Thee like a flock of sheep, grateful and<br/>obedient, though for ever trembling, lest Thou withdraw Thy hand<br/>and deny them Thy bread." But Thou wouldst not deprive man of<br/>freedom and didst reject the offer, thinking, what is that freedom<br/>worth if obedience is bought with bread? Thou didst reply that man<br/>lives not by bread alone. But dost Thou know that for the sake of<br/>that earthly bread the spirit of the earth will rise up against<br/>Thee and will strive with Thee and overcome Thee, and all will<br/>follow him, crying, "Who can compare with this beast? He has given<br/>us fire from heaven!" Dost Thou know that the ages will pass, and<br/>humanity will proclaim by the lips of their sages that there is no<br/>crime, and therefore no sin; there is only hunger? "Feed men, and<br/>then ask of them virtue!" that's what they'll write on the banner,<br/>which they will raise against Thee, and with which they will<br/>destroy Thy temple. Where Thy temple stood will rise a new<br/>building; the terrible tower of Babel will be built again, and<br/>though, like the one of old, it will not be finished, yet Thou<br/>mightest have prevented that new tower and have cut short the<br/>sufferings of men for a thousand years; for they will come back to<br/>us after a thousand years of agony with their tower. They will seek<br/>us again, hidden underground in the catacombs, for we shall be<br/>again persecuted and tortured. They will find us and cry to us,<br/>"Feed us, for those who have promised us fire from heaven haven't<br/>given it!" And then we shall finish building their tower, for he<br/>finishes the building who feeds them. And we alone shall feed them<br/>in Thy name, declaring falsely that it is in Thy name. Oh, never,<br/>never can they feed themselves without us! No science will give<br/>them bread so long as they remain free. In the end they will lay<br/>their freedom at our feet, and say to us, "Make us your slaves, but<br/>feed us." They will understand themselves, at last, that freedom<br/>and bread enough for all are inconceivable together, for never,<br/>never will they be able to share between them! They will be<br/>convinced, too, that they can never be free, for they are weak,<br/>vicious, worthless, and rebellious. Thou didst promise them the<br/>bread of Heaven, but, I repeat again, can it compare with earthly<br/>bread in the eyes of the weak, ever sinful and ignoble race of man?<br/>And if for the sake of the bread of Heaven thousands shall follow<br/>Thee, what is to become of the millions and tens of thousands of<br/>millions of creatures who will not have the strength to forego the<br/>earthly bread for the sake of the heavenly? Or dost Thou care only<br/>for the tens of thousands of the great and strong, while the<br/>millions, numerous as the sands of the sea, who are weak but love<br/>Thee, must exist only for the sake of the great and strong? No, we<br/>care for the weak too. They are sinful and rebellious, but in the<br/>end they too will become obedient. They will marvel at us and look<br/>on us as gods, because we are ready to endure the freedom which<br/>they have found so dreadful and to rule over them- so awful it will<br/>seem to them to be free. But we shall tell them that we are Thy<br/>servants and rule them in Thy name. We shall deceive them again,<br/>for we will not let Thee come to us again. That deception will be<br/>our suffering, for we shall be forced to lie.<br/><br/>"'This is the significance of the first question in the<br/>wilderness, and this is what Thou hast rejected for the sake of<br/>that freedom which Thou hast exalted above everything. Yet in this<br/>question lies hid the great secret of this world. Choosing "bread,"<br/>Thou wouldst have satisfied the universal and everlasting craving<br/>of humanity- to find someone to worship. So long as man remains<br/>free he strives for nothing so incessantly and so painfully as to<br/>find someone to worship. But man seeks to worship what is<br/>established beyond dispute, so that all men would agree at once to<br/>worship it. For these pitiful creatures are concerned not only to<br/>find what one or the other can worship, but to find community of<br/>worship is the chief misery of every man individually and of all<br/>humanity from the beginning of time. For the sake of common worship<br/>they've slain each other with the sword. They have set up gods and<br/>challenged one another, "Put away your gods and come and worship<br/>ours, or we will kill you and your gods!" And so it will be to the<br/>end of the world, even when gods disappear from the earth; they<br/>will fall down before idols just the same. Thou didst know, Thou<br/>couldst not but have known, this fundamental secret of human<br/>nature, but Thou didst reject the one infallible banner which was<br/>offered Thee to make all men bow down to Thee alone- the banner of<br/>earthly bread; and Thou hast rejected it for the sake of freedom<br/>and the bread of Heaven. Behold what Thou didst further. And all<br/>again in the name of freedom! I tell Thee that man is tormented by<br/>no greater anxiety than to find someone quickly to whom he can hand<br/>over that gift of freedom with which the ill-fated creature is<br/>born. But only one who can appease their conscience can take over<br/>their freedom. In bread there was offered Thee an invincible<br/>banner; give bread, and man will worship thee, for nothing is more<br/>certain than bread. But if someone else gains possession of his<br/>conscience- Oh! then he will cast away Thy bread and follow after<br/>him who has ensnared his conscience. In that Thou wast right. For<br/>the secret of man's being is not only to live but to have something<br/>to live for. Without a stable conception of the object of life, man<br/>would not consent to go on living, and would rather destroy himself<br/>than remain on earth, though he had bread in abundance. That is<br/>true. But what happened? Instead of taking men's freedom from them,<br/>Thou didst make it greater than ever! Didst Thou forget that man<br/>prefers peace, and even death, to freedom of choice in the<br/>knowledge of good and evil? Nothing is more seductive for man than<br/>his freedom of conscience, but nothing is a greater cause of<br/>suffering. And behold, instead of giving a firm foundation for<br/>setting the conscience of man at rest for ever, Thou didst choose<br/>all that is exceptional, vague and enigmatic; Thou didst choose<br/>what was utterly beyond the strength of men, acting as though Thou<br/>didst not love them at all- Thou who didst come to give Thy life<br/>for them! Instead of taking possession of men's freedom, Thou didst<br/>increase it, and burdened the spiritual kingdom of mankind with its<br/>sufferings for ever. Thou didst desire man's free love, that he<br/>should follow Thee freely, enticed and taken captive by Thee. In<br/>place of the rigid ancient law, man must hereafter with free heart<br/>decide for himself what is good and what is evil, having only Thy<br/>image before him as his guide. But didst Thou not know that he<br/>would at last reject even Thy image and Thy truth, if he is weighed<br/>down with the fearful burden of free choice? They will cry aloud at<br/>last that the truth is not in Thee, for they could not have been<br/>left in greater confusion and suffering than Thou hast caused,<br/>laying upon them so many cares and unanswerable problems.<br/><br/>"'So that, in truth, Thou didst Thyself lay the foundation for<br/>the destruction of Thy kingdom, and no one is more to blame for it.<br/>Yet what was offered Thee? There are three powers, three powers<br/>alone, able to conquer and to hold captive for ever the conscience<br/>of these impotent rebels for their happiness those forces are<br/>miracle, mystery and authority. Thou hast rejected all three and<br/>hast set the example for doing so. When the wise and dread spirit<br/>set Thee on the pinnacle of the temple and said to Thee, "If Thou<br/>wouldst know whether Thou art the Son of God then cast Thyself<br/>down, for it is written: the angels shall hold him up lest he fall<br/>and bruise himself, and Thou shalt know then whether Thou art the<br/>Son of God and shalt prove then how great is Thy faith in Thy<br/>Father." But Thou didst refuse and wouldst not cast Thyself down.<br/>Oh, of course, Thou didst proudly and well, like God; but the weak,<br/>unruly race of men, are they gods? Oh, Thou didst know then that in<br/>taking one step, in making one movement to cast Thyself down, Thou<br/>wouldst be tempting God and have lost all Thy faith in Him, and<br/>wouldst have been dashed to pieces against that earth which Thou<br/>didst come to save. And the wise spirit that tempted Thee would<br/>have rejoiced. But I ask again, are there many like Thee? And<br/>couldst Thou believe for one moment that men, too, could face such<br/>a temptation? Is the nature of men such, that they can reject<br/>miracle, and at the great moments of their life, the moments of<br/>their deepest, most agonising spiritual difficulties, cling only to<br/>the free verdict of the heart? Oh, Thou didst know that Thy deed<br/>would be recorded in books, would be handed down to remote times<br/>and the utmost ends of the earth, and Thou didst hope that man,<br/>following Thee, would cling to God and not ask for a miracle. But<br/>Thou didst not know that when man rejects miracle he rejects God<br/>too; for man seeks not so much God as the miraculous. And as man<br/>cannot bear to be without the miraculous, he will create new<br/>miracles of his own for himself, and will worship deeds of sorcery<br/>and witchcraft, though he might be a hundred times over a rebel,<br/>heretic and infidel. Thou didst not come down from the Cross when<br/>they shouted to Thee, mocking and reviling Thee, "Come down from<br/>the cross and we will believe that Thou art He." Thou didst not<br/>come down, for again Thou wouldst not enslave man by a miracle, and<br/>didst crave faith given freely, not based on miracle. Thou didst<br/>crave for free love and not the base raptures of the slave before<br/>the might that has overawed him for ever. But Thou didst think too<br/>highly of men therein, for they are slaves, of course, though<br/>rebellious by nature. Look round and judge; fifteen centuries have<br/>passed, look upon them. Whom hast Thou raised up to Thyself? I<br/>swear, man is weaker and baser by nature than Thou hast believed<br/>him! Can he, can he do what Thou didst? By showing him so much<br/>respect, Thou didst, as it were, cease to feel for him, for Thou<br/>didst ask far too much from him- Thou who hast loved him more than<br/>Thyself! Respecting him less, Thou wouldst have asked less of him.<br/>That would have been more like love, for his burden would have been<br/>lighter. He is weak and vile. What though he is everywhere now<br/>rebelling against our power, and proud of his rebellion? It is the<br/>pride of a child and a schoolboy. They are little children rioting<br/>and barring out the teacher at school. But their childish delight<br/>will end; it will cost them dear. Mankind as a whole has always<br/>striven to organise a universal state. There have been many great<br/>nations with great histories, but the more highly they were<br/>developed the more unhappy they were, for they felt more acutely<br/>than other people the craving for world-wide union. The great<br/>conquerors, Timours and Ghenghis-Khans, whirled like hurricanes<br/>over the face of the earth striving to subdue its people, and they<br/>too were but the unconscious expression of the same craving for<br/>universal unity. Hadst Thou taken the world and Caesar's purple,<br/>Thou wouldst have founded the universal state and have given<br/>universal peace. For who can rule men if not he who holds their<br/>conscience and their bread in his hands? We have taken the sword of<br/>Caesar, and in taking it, of course, have rejected Thee and<br/>followed him. Oh, ages are yet to come of the confusion of free<br/>thought, of their science and cannibalism. For having begun to<br/>build their tower of Babel without us, they will end, of course,<br/>with cannibalism. But then the beast will crawl to us and lick our<br/>feet and spatter them with tears of blood. And we shall sit upon<br/>the beast and raise the cup, and on it will be written, "Mystery."<br/>But then, and only then, the reign of peace and happiness will come<br/>for men. Thou art proud of Thine elect, but Thou hast only the<br/>elect, while we give rest to all. And besides, how many of those<br/>elect, those mighty ones who could become elect, have grown weary<br/>waiting for Thee, and have transferred and will transfer the powers<br/>of their spirit and the warmth of their heart to the other camp,<br/>and end by raising their free banner against Thee. Thou didst<br/>Thyself lift up that banner. But with us all will be happy and will<br/>no more rebel nor destroy one another as under Thy freedom. Oh, we<br/>shall persuade them that they will only become free when they<br/>renounce their freedom to us and submit to us. And shall we be<br/>right or shall we be lying? They will be convinced that we are<br/>right, for they will remember the horrors of slavery and confusion<br/>to which Thy freedom brought them. Freedom, free thought, and<br/>science will lead them into such straits and will bring them face<br/>to face with such marvels and insoluble mysteries, that some of<br/>them, the fierce and rebellious, will destroy themselves, others,<br/>rebellious but weak, will destroy one another, while the rest, weak<br/>and unhappy, will crawl fawning to our feet and whine to us: "Yes,<br/>you were right, you alone possess His mystery, and we come back to<br/>you, save us from ourselves!"<br/>
