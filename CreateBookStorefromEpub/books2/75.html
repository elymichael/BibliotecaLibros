"She was terribly scared.<br/><br/>"'Don't frighten me!' she said. 'Who told you so?'<br/><br/>"'Don't be uneasy,' I said, 'I won't tell anyone. You know I'm<br/>as silent as the tomb. I only wanted, in view of "possibilities,"<br/>to add, that when they demand that 4500 roubles from your father,<br/>and he can't produce it, he'll be tried, and made to serve as a<br/>common soldier in his old age, unless you like to send me your<br/>young lady secretly. I've just had money paid me. I'll give her<br/>four thousand, if you like, and keep the secret religiously.'<br/><br/>"'Ah, you scoundrel!'- that's what she said. 'You wicked<br/>scoundrel! How dare you!'<br/><br/>"She went away furiously indignant, while I shouted after her<br/>once more that the secret should be kept sacred. Those two simple<br/>creatures, Agafya and her aunt, I may as well say at once, behaved<br/>like perfect angels all through this business. They genuinely<br/>adored their 'Katya,' thought her far above them, and waited on<br/>her, hand and foot. But Agafya told her of our conversation. I<br/>found that out afterwards. She didn't keep it back, and of course<br/>that was all I wanted.<br/><br/>"Suddenly the new major arrived to take command of the<br/>battalion. The old lieutenant-colonel was taken ill at once,<br/>couldn't leave his room for two days, and didn't hand over the<br/>government money. Dr. Kravchenko declared that he really was ill.<br/>But I knew for a fact, and had known for a long time, that for the<br/>last four years the money had never been in his hands except when<br/>the Commander made his visits of inspection. He used to lend it to<br/>a trustworthy person, a merchant of our town called Trifonov, an<br/>old widower, with a big beard and gold-rimmed spectacles. He used<br/>to go to the fair, do a profitable business with the money, and<br/>return the whole sum to the colonel, bringing with it a present<br/>from the fair, as well as interest on the loan. But this time (I<br/>heard all about it quite by chance from Trifonov's son and heir, a<br/>drivelling youth and one of the most vicious in the world)- this<br/>time, I say, Trifonov brought nothing back from the fair. The<br/>lieutenant-colonel flew to him. 'I've never received any money from<br/>you, and couldn't possibly have received any.' That was all the<br/>answer he got. So now our lieutenant-colonel is confined to the<br/>house, with a towel round his head, while they're all three busy<br/>putting ice on it. All at once an orderly arrives on the scene with<br/>the book and the order to 'hand over the battalion money<br/>immediately, within two hours.' He signed the book (I saw the<br/>signature in the book afterwards), stood up, saying he would put on<br/>his uniform, ran to his bedroom, loaded his double-barrelled gun<br/>with a service bullet, took the boot off his right foot, fixed the<br/>gun against his chest, and began feeling for the trigger with his<br/>foot. But Agafya, remembering what I had told her, had her<br/>suspicions. She stole up and peeped into the room just in time. She<br/>rushed in, flung herself upon him from behind, threw her arms round<br/>him, and the gun went off, hit the ceiling, but hurt no one. The<br/>others ran in, took away the gun, and held him by the arms. I heard<br/>all about this afterwards. I was at home, it was getting dusk, and<br/>I was just preparing to go out. I had dressed, brushed my hair,<br/>scented my handkerchief, and taken up my cap, when suddenly the<br/>door opened, and facing me in the room stood Katerina Ivanovna.<br/><br/>"It's strange how things happen sometimes. No one had seen her<br/>in the street, so that no one knew of it in the town. I lodged with<br/>two decrepit old ladies, who looked after me. They were most<br/>obliging old things, ready to do anything for me, and at my request<br/>were as silent afterwards as two cast-iron posts. Of course I<br/>grasped the position at once. She walked in and looked straight at<br/>me, her dark eyes determined, even defiant, but on her lips and<br/>round mouth I saw uncertainty.<br/><br/>"'My sister told me,' she began, 'that you would give me 4500<br/>roubles if I came to you for it- myself. I have comeâ€¦ give me the<br/>money!'<br/><br/>"She couldn't keep it up. She was breathless, frightened, her<br/>voice failed her, and the corners of her mouth and the lines round<br/>it quivered. Alyosha, are you listening, or are you asleep?"<br/><br/>"Mitya, I know you will tell the whole truth, said Alyosha in<br/>agitation.<br/><br/>"I am telling it. If I tell the whole truth just as it happened<br/>I shan't spare myself. My first idea was a- Karamazov one. Once I<br/>was bitten by a centipede, brother, and laid up a fortnight with<br/>fever from it. Well, I felt a centipede biting at my heart then- a<br/>noxious insect, you understand? I looked her up and down. You've<br/>seen her? She's a beauty. But she was beautiful in another way<br/>then. At that moment she was beautiful because she was noble, and I<br/>was a scoundrel; she in all the grandeur of her generosity and<br/>sacrifice for her father, and I- a bug! And, scoundrel as I was,<br/>she was altogether at my mercy, body and soul. She was hemmed in. I<br/>tell you frankly, that thought, that venomous thought, so possessed<br/>my heart that it almost swooned with suspense. It seemed as if<br/>there could be no resisting it; as though I should act like a bug,<br/>like a venomous spider, without a spark of pity. I could scarcely<br/>breathe. Understand, I should have gone next day to ask for her<br/>hand, so that it might end honourably, so to speak, and that nobody<br/>would or could know. For though I'm a man of base desires, I'm<br/>honest. And at that very second some voice seemed to whisper in my<br/>ear, 'But when you come to-morrow to make your proposal, that girl<br/>won't even see you; she'll order her coachman to kick you out of<br/>the yard. "Publish it through all the town," she would say, "I'm<br/>not afraid of you." 'I looked at the young lady, my voice had not<br/>deceived me. That is how it would be, not a doubt of it. I could<br/>see from her face now that I should be turned out of the house. My<br/>spite was roused. I longed to play her the nastiest swinish cad's<br/>trick: to look at her with a sneer, and on the spot where she stood<br/>before me to stun her with a tone of voice that only a shopman<br/>could use.<br/>
