<br/>"That's right, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, you're quite right, one<br/>mustn't crush or torment a man, or any kind of creature, for every<br/>creature is created by God. Take a horse, for instance, for some<br/>folks, even among us drivers, drive anyhow. Nothing will restrain<br/>them, they just force it along."<br/><br/>"To hell?" Mitya interrupted, and went off into his abrupt,<br/>short laugh. "Andrey, simple soul," he seized him by the shoulders<br/>again, "tell me, will Dmitri Fyodorovitch Karamazov go to hell, or<br/>not, what do you think?"<br/><br/>"I don't know, darling, it depends on you, for you are… you see,<br/>sir, when the Son of God was nailed on the Cross and died, He went<br/>straight down to hell from the Cross, and set free all sinners that<br/>were in agony. And the devil groaned, because he thought that he<br/>would get no more sinners in hell. And God said to him, then,<br/>'Don't groan, for you shall have all the mighty of the earth, the<br/>rulers, the chief judges, and the rich men, and shall be filled up<br/>as you have been in all the ages till I come again.' Those were His<br/>very words… "<br/><br/>"A peasant legend! Capital! Whip up the left, Andrey!"<br/><br/>"So you see, sir, who it is hell's for," said Andrey, whipping<br/>up the left horse, "but you're like a little child… that's how we<br/>look on you… and though you're hasty-tempered, sir, yet God will<br/>forgive you for your kind heart."<br/><br/>"And you, do you forgive me, Andrey?"<br/><br/>"What should I forgive you for, sir? You've never done me any<br/>harm."<br/><br/>"No, for everyone, for everyone, you here alone, on the road,<br/>will you forgive me for everyone? Speak, simple peasant heart!"<br/><br/>"Oh, sir! I feel afraid of driving you, your talk is so<br/>strange."<br/><br/>But Mitya did not hear. He was frantically praying and muttering<br/>to himself.<br/><br/>
