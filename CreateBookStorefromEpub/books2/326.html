<br/>Mitya remembered Andrey again, and ordered punch to be sent out<br/>to him. "I was rude to him just now," he repeated with a sinking,<br/>softened voice. Kalgonov did to drink, and at first did not care<br/>for the girls singing; but after he had drunk a couple of glasses<br/>of champagne he became extraordinarily lively, strolling about the<br/>room, laughing and praising the music and the songs, admiring<br/>everyone and everything. Maximov, blissfully drunk, never left his<br/>side. Grushenka, too, was beginning to get drunk. Pointing to<br/>Kalganov, she said to Mitya:<br/><br/>"What a dear, charming boy he is!"<br/><br/>And Mitya, delighted, ran to kiss Kalgonov and Maximov. Oh,<br/>great were his hopes! She had said nothing yet, and seemed, indeed,<br/>purposely to refrain from speaking. But she looked at him from time<br/>to time with caressing and passionate eyes. At last she suddenly<br/>gripped his hand and drew him vigorously to her. She was sitting at<br/>the moment in the low chair by the door.<br/><br/>"How was it you came just now, eh? Have you walked in!… I was<br/>frightened. So you wanted to give me up to him, did you? Did you<br/>really want to?"<br/><br/>"I didn't want to spoil your happiness!" Mitya faltered<br/>blissfully. But she did not need his answer.<br/><br/>"Well, go and enjoy yourself… " she sent him away once more.<br/>"Don't cry, I'll call you back again."<br/><br/>He would run away and she listened to the singing and looked at<br/>the dancing, though her eyes followed him wherever he went. But in<br/>another quarter of an hour she would call him once more and again<br/>he would run back to her.<br/><br/>"Come, sit beside me, tell me, how did you hear about me, and my<br/>coming here yesterday? From whom did you first hear it?"<br/><br/>And Mitya began telling her all about it, disconnectedly,<br/>incoherently, feverishly. He spoke strangely, often frowning, and<br/>stopping abruptly.<br/><br/>"What are you frowning at?" she asked.<br/><br/>
