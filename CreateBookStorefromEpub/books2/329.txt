And would cause me many a tear.

And many more men come to try their luck, among them a
soldier:

The soldier came to try the girls:

Would they love him, would they not?

But the soldier is rejected with contempt, in two indecent
lines, sung with absolute frankness and producing a furore in the
audience. The song ends with a merchant:

The merchant came to try the girls:

Would they love him, would they not?

And it appears that he wins their love because:

The merchant will make gold for me

And his queen I'll gladly be.

Kalgonov was positively indignant.
