<br/>They threw open the doors, opened a window and the chimney.<br/>Mitya brought a pail of water from the passage. First he wetted his<br/>own head, then, finding a rag of some sort, dipped it into the<br/>water, and put it on Lyagavy's head. The forester still treated the<br/>matter contemptuously, and when he opened the window said<br/>grumpily:<br/><br/>"It'll be all right, now."<br/><br/>He went back to sleep, leaving Mitya a lighted lantern. Mitya<br/>fussed about the drunken peasant for half an hour, wetting his<br/>head, and gravely resolved not to sleep all night. But he was so<br/>worn out that when he sat down for a moment to take breath, he<br/>closed his eyes, unconsciously stretched himself full length on the<br/>bench and slept like the dead.<br/><br/>It was dreadfully late when he waked. It was somewhere about<br/>nine o'clock. The sun was shining brightly in the two little<br/>windows of the hut. The curly-headed peasant was sitting on the<br/>bench and had his coat on. He had another samovar and another<br/>bottle in front of him. Yesterday's bottle had already been<br/>finished, and the new one was more than half empty. Mitya jumped up<br/>and saw at once that the cursed peasant was drunk again, hopelessly<br/>and incurably. He stared at him for a moment with wide opened eyes.<br/>The peasant was silently and slyly watching him, with insulting<br/>composure, and even a sort of contemptuous condescension, so Mitya<br/>fancied. He rushed up to him.<br/><br/>"Excuse me, you see… I… you've most likely heard from the<br/>forester here in the hut. I'm Lieutenant Dmitri Karamazov, the son<br/>of the old Karamazov whose copse you are buying."<br/><br/>"That's a lie!" said the peasant, calmly and confidently.<br/><br/>"A lie? You know Fyodor Pavlovitch?"<br/><br/>"I don't know any of your Fyodor Pavlovitches," said the<br/>peasant, speaking thickly.<br/><br/>"You're bargaining with him for the copse, for the copse. Do<br/>wake up, and collect yourself. Father Pavel of Ilyinskoe brought me<br/>here. You wrote to Samsonov, and he has sent me to you," Mitya<br/>gasped breathlessly.<br/><br/>"You're lying!" Lyagavy blurted out again. Mitya's legs went<br/>cold.<br/><br/>
