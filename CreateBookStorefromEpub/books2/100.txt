"Alyosha," he whispered apprehensively, "where's Ivan?"

"In the yard. He's got a headache. He's on the watch."

"Give me that looking-glass. It stands over there. Give it
me."

Alyosha gave him a little round folding looking-glass which
stood on the chest of drawers. The old man looked at himself in it;
his nose was considerably swollen, and on the left side of his
forehead there was a rather large crimson bruise.

"What does Ivan say? Alyosha, my dear, my only son, I'm afraid
of Ivan. I'm more afraid of Ivan than the other. You're the only
one I'm not afraid ofâ€¦ ."

"Don't be afraid of Ivan either. He is angry, but he'll defend
you."

"Alyosha, and what of the other? He's run to Grushenka. My
angel, tell me the truth, was she here just now or not?"

"No one has seen her. It was a mistake. She has not been
here."

"You know Mitya wants to marry her, to marry her."

"She won't marry him."

"She won't. She won't. She won't. She won't on any account!"
