<br/>"It's true, indeed, Smerdyakov is accused only by the prisoner,<br/>his two brothers, and Madame Svyetlov. But there are others who<br/>accuse him: there are vague rumours of a question, of a suspicion,<br/>an obscure report, a feeling of expectation. Finally, we have the<br/>evidence of a combination of facts very suggestive, though, I<br/>admit, inconclusive. In the first place we have precisely on the<br/>day of the catastrophe that fit, for the genuineness of which the<br/>prosecutor, for some reason, has felt obliged to make a careful<br/>defence. Then Smerdyakov's sudden suicide on the eve of the trial.<br/>Then the equally startling evidence given in court to-day by the<br/>elder of the prisoner's brothers, who had believed in his guilt,<br/>but has to-day produced a bundle of notes and proclaimed Smerdyakov<br/>as the murderer. Oh, I fully share the court's and the prosecutor's<br/>conviction that Ivan Karamazov is suffering from brain fever, that<br/>his statement may really be a desperate effort, planned in<br/>delirium, to save his brother by throwing the guilt on the dead<br/>man. But again Smerdyakov's name is pronounced, again there is a<br/>suggestion of mystery. There is something unexplained, incomplete.<br/>And perhaps it may one day be explained. But we won't go into that<br/>now. Of that later.<br/><br/>"The court has resolved to go on with the trial, but, meantime,<br/>I might make a few remarks about the character-sketch of Smerdyakov<br/>drawn with subtlety and talent by the prosecutor. But while I<br/>admire his talent I cannot agree with him. I have visited<br/>Smerdyakov, I have seen him and talked to him, and he made a very<br/>different impression on me. He was weak in health, it is true; but<br/>in character, in spirit, he was by no means the weak man the<br/>prosecutor has made him out to be. I found in him no trace of the<br/>timidity on which the prosecutor so insisted. There was no<br/>simplicity about him, either. I found in him, on the contrary, an<br/>extreme mistrustfulness concealed under a mask of naivete, and an<br/>intelligence of considerable range. The prosecutor was too simple<br/>in taking him for weak-minded. He made a very definite impression<br/>on me: I left him with the conviction that he was a distinctly<br/>spiteful creature, excessively ambitious, vindictive, and intensely<br/>envious. I made some inquiries: he resented his parentage, was<br/>ashamed of it, and would clench his teeth when he remembered that<br/>he was the son of 'stinking Lizaveta.' He was disrespectful to the<br/>servant Grigory and his wife, who had cared for him in his<br/>childhood. He cursed and jeered at Russia. He dreamed of going to<br/>France and becoming a Frenchman. He used often to say that he<br/>hadn't the means to do so. I fancy he loved no one but himself and<br/>had a strangely high opinion of himself. His conception of culture<br/>was limited to good clothes, clean shirt-fronts and polished boots.<br/>Believing himself to be the illegitimate son of Fyodor Pavlovitch<br/>(there is evidence of this), he might well have resented his<br/>position, compared with that of his master's legitimate sons. They<br/>had everything, he nothing. They had all the rights, they had the<br/>inheritance, while he was only the cook. He told me himself that he<br/>had helped Fyodor Pavlovitch to put the notes in the envelope. The<br/>destination of that sum- a sum which would have made his career-<br/>must have been hateful to him. Moreover, he saw three thousand<br/>roubles in new rainbow-coloured notes. (I asked him about that on<br/>purpose.) Oh, beware of showing an ambitious and envious man a<br/>large sum of money at once! And it was the first time he had seen<br/>so much money in the hands of one man. The sight of the<br/>rainbow-coloured notes may have made a morbid impression on his<br/>imagination, but with no immediate results.<br/><br/>"The talented prosecutor, with extraordinary subtlety, sketched<br/>for us all the arguments for and against the hypothesis of<br/>Smerdyakov's guilt, and asked us in particular what motive he had<br/>in feigning a fit. But he may not have been feigning at all, the<br/>fit may have happened quite naturally, but it may have passed off<br/>quite naturally, and the sick man may have recovered, not<br/>completely perhaps, but still regaining consciousness, as happens<br/>with epileptics.<br/><br/>"The prosecutor asks at what moment could Smerdyakov have<br/>committed the murder. But it is very easy to point out that moment.<br/>He might have waked up from deep sleep (for he was only asleep- an<br/>epileptic fit is always followed by a deep sleep) at that moment<br/>when the old Grigory shouted at the top of his voice 'Parricide!'<br/>That shout in the dark and stillness may have waked Smerdyakov<br/>whose sleep may have been less sound at the moment: he might<br/>naturally have waked up an hour before.<br/><br/>"Getting out of bed, he goes almost unconsciously and with no<br/>definite motive towards the sound to see what's the matter. His<br/>head is still clouded with his attack, his faculties are half<br/>asleep; but, once in the garden, he walks to the lighted windows<br/>and he hears terrible news from his master, who would be, of<br/>course, glad to see him. His mind sets to work at once. He hears<br/>all the details from his frightened master, and gradually in his<br/>disordered brain there shapes itself an idea- terrible, but<br/>seductive and irresistibly logical. To kill the old man, take the<br/>three thousand, and throw all the blame on to his young master. A<br/>terrible lust of money, of booty, might seize upon him as he<br/>realised his security from detection. Oh! these sudden and<br/>irresistible impulses come so often when there is a favourable<br/>opportunity, and especially with murderers who have had no idea of<br/>committing a murder beforehand. And Smerdyakov may have gone in and<br/>carried out his plan. With what weapon? Why, with any stone picked<br/>up in the garden. But what for, with what object? Why, the three<br/>thousand which means a career for him. Oh, I am not contradicting<br/>myself- the money may have existed. And perhaps Smerdyakov alone<br/>knew where to find it, where his master kept it. And the covering<br/>of the money- the torn envelope on the floor?<br/><br/>"Just now, when the prosecutor was explaining his subtle theory<br/>that only an inexperienced thief like Karamazov would have left the<br/>envelope on the floor, and not one like Smerdyakov, who would have<br/>avoided leaving a piece of evidence against himself, I thought as I<br/>listened that I was hearing something very familiar, and, would you<br/>believe it, I have heard that very argument, that very conjecture,<br/>of how Karamazov would have behaved, precisely two days before,<br/>from Smerdyakov himself. What's more, it struck me at the time. I<br/>fancied that there was an artificial simplicity about him; that he<br/>was in a hurry to suggest this idea to me that I might fancy it was<br/>my own. He insinuated it, as it were. Did he not insinuate the same<br/>idea at the inquiry and suggest it to the talented prosecutor?<br/><br/>"I shall be asked, 'What about the old woman, Grigory's wife?<br/>She heard the sick man moaning close by, all night.' Yes, she heard<br/>it, but that evidence is extremely unreliable. I knew a lady who<br/>complained bitterly that she had been kept awake all night by a dog<br/>in the yard. Yet the poor beast, it appeared, had only yelped once<br/>or twice in the night. And that's natural. If anyone is asleep and<br/>hears a groan he wakes up, annoyed at being waked, but instantly<br/>falls asleep again. Two hours later, again a groan, he wakes up and<br/>falls asleep again; and the same thing again two hours later- three<br/>times altogether in the night. Next morning the sleeper wakes up<br/>and complains that someone has been groaning all night and keeping<br/>him awake. And it is bound to seem so to him: the intervals of two<br/>hours of sleep he does not remember, he only remembers the moments<br/>of waking, so he feels he has been waked up all night.<br/><br/>"But why, why, asks the prosecutor, did not Smerdyakov confess<br/>in his last letter? Why did his conscience prompt him to one step<br/>and not to both? But, excuse me, conscience implies penitence, and<br/>the suicide may not have felt penitence, but only despair. Despair<br/>and penitence are two very different things. Despair may be<br/>vindictive and irreconcilable, and the suicide, laying his hands on<br/>himself, may well have felt redoubled hatred for those whom he had<br/>envied all his life.<br/><br/>"Gentlemen of the jury, beware of a miscarriage of justice! What<br/>is there unlikely in all I have put before you just now? Find the<br/>error in my reasoning; find the impossibility, the absurdity. And<br/>if there is but a shade of possibility, but a shade of probability<br/>in my propositions, do not condemn him. And is there only a shade?<br/>I swear by all that is sacred, I fully believe in the explanation<br/>of the murder I have just put forward. What troubles me and makes<br/>me indignant is that of all the mass of facts heaped up by the<br/>prosecution against the prisoner, there is not a single one certain<br/>and irrefutable. And yet the unhappy man is to be ruined by the<br/>accumulation of these facts. Yes, the accumulated effect is awful:<br/>the blood, the blood dripping from his fingers, the bloodstained<br/>shirt, the dark night resounding with the shout 'Parricide!' and<br/>the old man falling with a broken head. And then the mass of<br/>phrases, statements, gestures, shouts! Oh! this has so much<br/>influence, it can so bias the mind; but, gentlemen of the jury, can<br/>it bias your minds? Remember, you have been given absolute power to<br/>bind and to loose, but the greater the power, the more terrible its<br/>responsibility.<br/><br/>"I do not draw back one iota from what I have said just now, but<br/>suppose for one moment I agreed with the prosecution that my<br/>luckless client had stained his hands with his father's blood. This<br/>is only hypothesis, I repeat; I never for one instant doubt of his<br/>innocence. But, so be it, I assume that my client is guilty of<br/>parricide. Even so, hear what I have to say. I have it in my heart<br/>to say something more to you, for I feel that there must be a great<br/>conflict in your hearts and minds… . Forgive my referring to your<br/>hearts and minds, gentlemen of the jury, but I want to be truthful<br/>and sincere to the end. Let us all be sincere!"<br/><br/>
