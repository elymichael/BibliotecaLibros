<br/>"It's at him," she said, pointing to Alyosha, with childish<br/>vexation at herself for not being able to repress her mirth.<br/><br/>If anyone had looked at Alyosha standing a step behind the<br/>elder, he would have caught a quick flush crimsoning his cheeks in<br/>an instant. His eyes shone and he looked down.<br/><br/>"She has a message for you, Alexey Fyodorovitch. How are you?"<br/>the mother went on, holding out her exquisitely gloved hand to<br/>Alyosha.<br/><br/>The elder turned round and all at once looked attentively at<br/>Alyosha.

Think what she has gone through, what she is enduring<br/>now Think what awaits her! It's all terrible, terrible!<br/><br/>"Very well, I will come," Alyosha decided, after rapidly<br/>scanning the brief, enigmatic note, which consisted of an urgent<br/>entreaty that he would come, without any sort of explanation.<br/><br/>
