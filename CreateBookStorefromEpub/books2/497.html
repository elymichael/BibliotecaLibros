A trace of colour came into<br/>his face.<br/><br/>"If I was pleased," he articulated rather breathlessly, "it was<br/>simply because you agreed not to go to Moscow, but to Tchermashnya.<br/>For it was nearer, anyway. Only when I said these words to you, it<br/>was not by way of praise, but of reproach.

Ivan swore again.
