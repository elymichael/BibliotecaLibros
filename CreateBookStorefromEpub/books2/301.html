<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>6<br/>"I<br/>Am Coming, Too!"<br/><br/><br/>BUT Dmitri Fyodorovitch was speeding along the road. It was a<br/>little more than twenty versts to Mokroe, but Andrey's three horses<br/>galloped at such a pace that the distance might be covered in an<br/>hour and a quarter. The swift motion revived Mitya. The air was<br/>fresh and cool, there were big stars shining in the sky. It was the<br/>very night, and perhaps the very hour, in which Alyosha fell on the<br/>earth, and rapturously swore to love it for ever and ever.<br/><br/>All was confusion, confusion in Mitya's soul, but although many<br/>things were goading his heart, at that moment his whole being was<br/>yearning for her, his queen, to whom he was flying to look on her<br/>for the last time. One thing I can say for certain; his heart did<br/>not waver for one instant. I shall perhaps not be believed when I<br/>say that this jealous lover felt not the slightest jealousy of this<br/>new rival, who seemed to have sprung out of the earth. If any other<br/>had appeared on the scene, he would have been jealous at once, and<br/>would-perhaps have stained his fierce hands with blood again. But<br/>as he flew through the night, he felt no envy, no hostility even,<br/>for the man who had been her first lover… . It is true he had not<br/>yet seen him.<br/><br/>"Here there was no room for dispute: it was her right and his;<br/>this was her first love which, after five years, she had not<br/>forgotten; so she had loved him only for those five years, and I,<br/>how do I come in? What right have I? Step aside, Mitya, and make<br/>way! What am I now? Now everything is over apart from the officer<br/>even if he had not appeared, everything would be over… "<br/><br/>These words would roughly have expressed his feelings, if he had<br/>been capable of reasoning. But he could not reason at that moment.<br/>His present plan of action had arisen without reasoning. At Fenya's<br/>first words, it had sprung from feeling, and been adopted in a<br/>flash, with all its consequences. And yet, in spite of his<br/>resolution, there was confusion in his soul, an agonising<br/>confusion: his resolution did not give him peace. There was so much<br/>behind that tortured him. And it seemed strange to him, at moments,<br/>to think that he had written his own sentence of death with pen and<br/>paper: "I punish myself," and the paper was lying there in his<br/>pocket, ready; the pistol was loaded; he had already resolved how,<br/>next morning, he would meet the first warm ray of "golden-haired<br/>Phoebus."<br/><br/>And yet he could not be quit of the past, of all that he had<br/>left behind and that tortured him. He felt that miserably, and the<br/>thought of it sank into his heart with despair. There was one<br/>moment when he felt an impulse to stop Andrey, to jump out of the<br/>cart, to pull out his loaded pistol, and to make an end of<br/>everything without waiting for the dawn. But that moment flew by<br/>like a spark. The horses galloped on, "devouring space," and as he<br/>drew near his goal, again the thought of her, of her alone, took<br/>more and more complete possession of his soul, chasing away the<br/>fearful images that had been haunting it. Oh, how he longed to look<br/>upon her, if only for a moment, if only from a distance!<br/><br/>"She's now with him," he thought, "now I shall see what she<br/>looks like with him, her first love, and that's all I want." Never<br/>had this woman, who was such a fateful influence in his life,<br/>aroused such love in his breast, such new and unknown feeling,<br/>surprising even to himself, a feeling tender to devoutness, to<br/>self-effacement before her! "I will efface myself!" he said, in a<br/>rush of almost hysterical ecstasy.<br/><br/>They had been galloping nearly an hour. Mitya was silent, and<br/>though Andrey was, as a rule, a talkative peasant, he did not utter<br/>a word, either. He seemed afraid to talk, he only whipped up<br/>smartly his three lean, but mettlesome, bay horses. Suddenly Mitya<br/>cried out in horrible anxiety:<br/>
