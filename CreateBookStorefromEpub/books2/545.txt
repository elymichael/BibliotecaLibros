Fortune Smiles on Mitya


IT came quite as a surprise even to Alyosha himself. He was not
required to take the oath, and I remember that both sides addressed
him very gently and sympathetically. It was evident that his
reputation for goodness had preceded him. Alyosha gave his evidence
modestly and with restraint, but his warm sympathy for his unhappy
brother was unmistakable. In answer to one question, he sketched
his brother's character as that of a man, violent-tempered perhaps
and carried away by his passions, but at the same time honourable,
proud and generous, capable of self-sacrifice, if necessary. He
admitted, however, that, through his passion for Grushenka and his
rivalry with his father, his brother had been of late in an
intolerable position. But he repelled with indignation the
suggestion that his brother might have committed a murder for the
sake of gain, though he recognised that the three thousand roubles
had become almost an obsession with Mitya; that upon them as part
of the inheritance he had been cheated of by his father, and that,
indifferent as he was to money as a rule, he could not even speak
of that three thousand without fury. As for the rivalry of the two
"ladies," as the prosecutor expressed it- that is, of Grushenka and
Katya- he answered evasively and was even unwilling to answer one
or two questions altogether.

"Did your brother tell you, anyway, that he intended to kill
your father?" asked the prosecutor. "You can refuse to answer if
you think necessary," he added.

"He did not tell me so directly," answered Alyosha.

"How so? Did he indirectly?"

"He spoke to me once of his hatred for our father and his fear
that at an extreme momentâ€¦ at a moment of fury, he might perhaps
murder him."

"And you believed him?"

"I am afraid to say that I did. But I never doubted that some
higher feeling would always save him at that fatal moment, as it
has indeed saved him, for it was not he killed my father," Alyosha
said firmly, in a loud voice that was heard throughout the
court.
