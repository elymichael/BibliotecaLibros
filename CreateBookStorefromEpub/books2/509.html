<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>8<br/>The Third and Last Interview with Smerdyakov<br/><br/><br/>WHEN he was half-way there, the keen dry wind that had been<br/>blowing early that morning rose again, and a fine dry snow began<br/>falling thickly. It did not lie on the ground, but was whirled<br/>about by the wind, and soon there was a regular snowstorm. There<br/>were scarcely any lamp-posts in the part of the town where<br/>Smerdyakov lived. Ivan strode alone in the darkness, unconscious of<br/>the storm, instinctively picking out his way. His head ached and<br/>there was a painful throbbing in his temples. He felt that his<br/>hands were twitching convulsively. Not far from Marya<br/>Kondratyevna's cottage, Ivan suddenly came upon a solitary drunken<br/>little peasant. He was wearing a coarse and patched coat, and was<br/>walking in zigzags, grumbling and swearing to himself. Then<br/>suddenly he would begin singing in a husky drunken voice:<br/><br/>Ach, Vanka's gone to Petersburg;<br/><br/>I won't wait till he comes back.<br/><br/>But he broke off every time at the second line and began<br/>swearing again; then he would begin the same song again. Ivan felt<br/>an intense hatred for him before he had thought about him at all.<br/>Suddenly he realised his presence and felt an irresistible impulse<br/>to knock him down. At that moment they met, and the peasant with a<br/>violent lurch fell full tilt against Ivan, who pushed him back<br/>furiously. The peasant went flying backwards and fell like a log on<br/>the frozen ground. He uttered one plaintive "O- oh!" and then was<br/>silent. Ivan stepped up to him. He was lying on his back, without<br/>movement or consciousness. "He will be frozen," thought Ivan, and<br/>he went on his way to Smerdyakov's.<br/><br/>In the passage, Marya Kondratyevna, who ran out to open the door<br/>with a candle in her hand, whispered that Smerdyakov was very ill;<br/>"It's not that he's laid up, but he seems not himself, and he even<br/>told us to take the tea away; he wouldn't have any."<br/><br/>"Why, does he make a row?" asked Ivan coarsely.<br/><br/>"Oh dear no, quite the contrary, he's very quiet. Only please<br/>don't talk to him too long," Marya Kondratyevna begged him. Ivan<br/>opened the door and stepped into the room.<br/>
