<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>4<br/>At<br/>the Hohlakovs'<br/><br/><br/>ALYOSHA soon reached Madame Hohlakov's house, a handsome stone<br/>house of two stories, one of the finest in our town. Though Madame<br/>Hohlakov spent most of her time in another province where she had<br/>an estate, or in Moscow, where she had a house of her own, yet she<br/>had a house in our town too, inherited from her forefathers. The<br/>estate in our district was the largest of her three estates, yet<br/>she had been very little in our province before this time. She ran<br/>out to Alyosha in the hall.<br/><br/>"Did you get my letter about the new miracle?" She spoke rapidly<br/>and nervously.<br/><br/>"Yes"<br/><br/>"Did you show it to everyone? He restored the son to his<br/>mother!"<br/><br/>"He is dying to-day," said Alyosha.<br/><br/>"I have heard, I know, oh, how I long to talk to you, to you or<br/>someone, about all this. No, to you, to you! And how sorry I am I<br/>can't see him! The whole town is in excitement, they are all<br/>suspense. But now- do you know Katerina Ivanovna is here now?"<br/><br/>"Ah, that's lucky," cried Alyosha. "Then I shall see her here.<br/>She told me yesterday to be sure to come and see her to-day."<br/>
