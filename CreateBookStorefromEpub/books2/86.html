<br/>"No, I haven't," said Alyosha, smiling, too.<br/><br/>"Ah, but you were frightened, you were frightened this morning,<br/>weren't you? There, my darling, I couldn't do anything to vex you.<br/>Do you know, Ivan, I can't resist the way he looks one straight in<br/>the face and laughs? It makes me laugh all over. I'm so fond of<br/>him. Alyosha, let me give you my blessing- a father's<br/>blessing."<br/><br/>Alyosha rose, but Fyodor Pavlovitch had already changed his<br/>mind.<br/><br/>"No, no," he said. "I'll just make the sign of the cross over<br/>you, for now. Sit still. Now we've a treat for you, in your own<br/>line, too. It'll make you laugh. Balaam's ass has begun talking to<br/>us here- and how he talks! How he talks!<br/><br/>Balaam's ass, it appeared, was the valet, Smerdyakov. He was a<br/>young man of about four and twenty, remarkably unsociable and<br/>taciturn. Not that he was shy or bashful. On the contrary, he was<br/>conceited and seemed to despise everybody.<br/><br/>But we must pause to say a few words about him now. He was<br/>brought up by Grigory and Marfa, but the boy grew up "with no sense<br/>of gratitude," as Grigory expressed it; he was an unfriendly boy,<br/>and seemed to look at the world mistrustfully. In his childhood he<br/>was very fond of hanging cats, and burying them with great<br/>ceremony. He used to dress up in a sheet as though it were a<br/>surplice, and sang, and waved some object over the dead cat as<br/>though it were a censer. All this he did on the sly, with the<br/>greatest secrecy. Grigory caught him once at this diversion and<br/>gave him a sound beating. He shrank into a corner and sulked there<br/>for a week. "He doesn't care for you or me, the monster," Grigory<br/>used to say to Marfa, "and he doesn't care for anyone. Are you a<br/>human being?" he said, addressing the boy directly. "You're not a<br/>human being. You grew from the mildew in the bath-house. That's<br/>what you are," Smerdyakov, it appeared afterwards, could never<br/>forgive him those words. Grigory taught him to read and write, and<br/>when he was twelve years old, began teaching him the Scriptures.<br/>But this teaching came to nothing. At the second or third lesson<br/>the boy suddenly grinned.<br/><br/>"What's that for?" asked Grigory, looking at him threateningly<br/>from under his spectacles.<br/><br/>"Oh, nothing. God created light on the first day, and the sun,<br/>moon, and stars on the fourth day. Where did the light come from on<br/>the first day?"<br/><br/>Grigory was thunderstruck. The boy looked sarcastically at his<br/>teacher. There was something positively condescending in his<br/>expression. Grigory could not restrain himself. "I'll show you<br/>where!" he cried, and gave the boy a violent slap on the cheek. The<br/>boy took the slap without a word, but withdrew into his corner<br/>again for some days. A week later he had his first attack of the<br/>disease to which he was subject all the rest of his life- epilepsy.<br/>When Fyodor Pavlovitch heard of it, his attitude to the boy seemed<br/>changed at once. Till then he had taken no notice of him, though he<br/>never scolded him, and always gave him a copeck when he met him.<br/>Sometimes, when he was in good humour, he would send the boy<br/>something sweet from his table. But as soon as he heard of his<br/>illness, he showed an active interest in him, sent for a doctor,<br/>and tried remedies, but the disease turned out to be incurable. The<br/>fits occurred, on an average, once a month, but at various<br/>intervals. The fits varied too, in violence: some were light and<br/>some were very severe. Fyodor Pavlovitch strictly forbade Grigory<br/>to use corporal punishment to the boy, and began allowing him to<br/>come upstairs to him. He forbade him to be taught anything whatever<br/>for a time, too. One day when the boy was about fifteen, Fyodor<br/>Pavlovitch noticed him lingering by the bookcase, and reading the<br/>titles through the glass. Fyodor Pavlovitch had a fair number of<br/>books- over a hundred- but no one ever saw him reading. He at once<br/>gave Smerdyakov the key of the bookcase. "Come, read. You shall be<br/>my librarian. You'll be better sitting reading than hanging about<br/>the courtyard. Come, read this," and Fyodor Pavlovitch gave him<br/>Evenings in a Cottage near Dikanka.<br/><br/>He read a little but didn't like it. He did not once smile, and<br/>ended by frowning.<br/><br/>
