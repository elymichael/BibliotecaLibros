At
the Hohlakovs'


ALYOSHA soon reached Madame Hohlakov's house, a handsome stone
house of two stories, one of the finest in our town. Though Madame
Hohlakov spent most of her time in another province where she had
an estate, or in Moscow, where she had a house of her own, yet she
had a house in our town too, inherited from her forefathers. The
estate in our district was the largest of her three estates, yet
she had been very little in our province before this time. She ran
out to Alyosha in the hall.

"Did you get my letter about the new miracle?" She spoke rapidly
and nervously.

"Yes"

"Did you show it to everyone? He restored the son to his
mother!"

"He is dying to-day," said Alyosha.

"I have heard, I know, oh, how I long to talk to you, to you or
someone, about all this. No, to you, to you! And how sorry I am I
can't see him! The whole town is in excitement, they are all
suspense. But now- do you know Katerina Ivanovna is here now?"

"Ah, that's lucky," cried Alyosha. "Then I shall see her here.
She told me yesterday to be sure to come and see her to-day."
