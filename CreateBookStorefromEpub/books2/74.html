<br/>"I think not."<br/><br/>"Hush, Alyosha, hush, darling! I could kiss your hand, you touch<br/>me so. That rogue Grushenka has an eye for men. She told me once<br/>that she'd devour you one day. There, there, I won't! From this<br/>field of corruption fouled by flies, let's pass to my tragedy, also<br/>befouled by flies, that is, by every sort of vileness. Although the<br/>old man told lies about my seducing innocence, there really was<br/>something of the sort in my tragedy, though it was only once, and<br/>then it did not come off. The old man who has reproached me with<br/>what never happened does not even know of this fact; I never told<br/>anyone about it. You're the first, except Ivan, of course- Ivan<br/>knows everything. He knew about it long before you. But Ivan's a<br/>tomb."<br/><br/>"Ivan's a tomb?"<br/><br/>Alyosha listened with great attention.<br/><br/>"I was lieutenant in a line regiment, but still I was under<br/>supervision, like a kind of convict. Yet I was awfully well<br/>received in the little town. I spent money right and left. I was<br/>thought to be rich; I thought so myself. But I must have pleased<br/>them in other ways as well. Although they shook their heads over<br/>me, they liked me. My colonel, who was an old man, took a sudden<br/>dislike to me. He was always down upon me, but I had powerful<br/>friends, and, moreover, all the town was on my side, so he couldn't<br/>do me much harm. I was in fault myself for refusing to treat him<br/>with proper respect. I was proud. This obstinate old fellow, who<br/>was really a very good sort, kind-hearted and hospitable, had had<br/>two wives, both dead. His first wife, who was of a humble family,<br/>left a daughter as unpretentious as herself. She was a young woman<br/>of four and twenty when I was there, and was living with her father<br/>and an aunt, her mother's sister. The aunt was simple and<br/>illiterate; the niece was simple but lively. I like to say nice<br/>things about people. I never knew a woman of more charming<br/>character than Agafya- fancy, her name was Agafya Ivanovna! And she<br/>wasn't bad-looking either, in the Russian style: tall, stout, with<br/>a full figure, and beautiful eyes, though a rather coarse face. She<br/>had not married, although she had had two suitors. She refused<br/>them, but was as cheerful as ever. I was intimate with her, not in<br/>'that' way, it was pure friendship. I have often been friendly with<br/>women quite innocently. I used to talk to her with shocking<br/>frankness, and she only laughed. Many woman like such freedom, and<br/>she was a girl too, which made it very amusing. Another thing, one<br/>could never think of her as a young lady. She and her aunt lived in<br/>her father's house with a sort of voluntary humility, not putting<br/>themselves on an equality with other people. She was a general<br/>favourite, and of use of everyone, for she was a clever dressmaker.<br/>She had a talent for it. She gave her services freely without<br/>asking for payment, but if anyone offered her payment, she didn't<br/>refuse. The colonel, of course, was a very different matter. He was<br/>one of the chief personages in the district. He kept open house,<br/>entertained the whole town, gave suppers and dances. At the time I<br/>arrived and joined the battalion, all the town was talking of the<br/>expected return of the colonel's second daughter, a great beauty,<br/>who had just left a fashionable school in the capital. This second<br/>daughter is Katerina Ivanovna, and she was the child of the second<br/>wife, who belonged to a distinguished general's family; although,<br/>as I learnt on good authority, she too brought the colonel no<br/>money. She had connections, and that was all. There may have been<br/>expectations, but they had come to nothing.<br/><br/>"Yet, when the young lady came from boarding-school on a visit,<br/>the whole town revived. Our most distinguished ladies- two<br/>'Excellencies' and a colonel's wife- and all the rest following<br/>their lead, at once took her up and gave entertainments in her<br/>honour. She was the belle of the balls and picnics, and they got up<br/>tableaux vivants in aid of distressed governesses. I took no<br/>notice, I went on as wildly as before, and one of my exploits at<br/>the time set all the town talking. I saw her eyes taking my measure<br/>one evening at the battery commander's, but I didn't go up to her,<br/>as though I disdained her acquaintance. I did go up and speak to<br/>her at an evening party not long after. She scarcely looked at me,<br/>and compressed her lips scornfully. 'Wait a bit. I'll have my<br/>revenge,' thought I. I behaved like an awful fool on many occasions<br/>at that time, and I was conscious of it myself. What made it worse<br/>was that I felt that 'Katenka' was not an innocent boarding-school<br/>miss, but a person of character, proud and really high-principled;<br/>above all, she had education and intellect, and I had neither. You<br/>think I meant to make her an offer? No, I simply wanted to revenge<br/>myself, because I was such a hero and she didn't seem to feel<br/>it.<br/><br/>"Meanwhile, I spent my time in drink and riot, till the<br/>lieutenant-colonel put me under arrest for three days. Just at that<br/>time father sent me six thousand roubles in return for my sending<br/>him a deed giving up all claims upon him- settling our accounts, so<br/>to speak, and saying that I wouldn't expect anything more. I didn't<br/>understand a word of it at the time. Until I came here, Alyosha,<br/>till the last few days, indeed, perhaps even now, I haven't been<br/>able to make head or tail of my money affairs with father. But<br/>never mind that, we'll talk of it later.<br/><br/>"Just as I received the money, I got a letter from a friend<br/>telling me something that interested me immensely. The authorities,<br/>I learnt, were dissatisfied with our lieutenant-colonel. He was<br/>suspected of irregularities; in fact, his enemies were preparing a<br/>surprise for him. And then the commander of the division arrived,<br/>and kicked up the devil of a shindy. Shortly afterwards he was<br/>ordered to retire. I won't tell you how it all happened. He had<br/>enemies certainly. Suddenly there was a marked coolness in the town<br/>towards him and all his family. His friends all turned their backs<br/>on him. Then I took my first step. I met Agafya Ivanovna, with whom<br/>I'd always kept up a friendship, and said, 'Do you know there's a<br/>deficit of 4500 roubles of government money in your father's<br/>accounts?'<br/><br/>"'What do you mean? What makes you say so? The general was here<br/>not long ago, and everything was all right.'<br/><br/>"'Then it was, but now it isn't.'<br/><br/>
