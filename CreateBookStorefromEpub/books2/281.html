<br/>"Good heavens! What am I doing it for?" thought Mitya, suddenly<br/>pulling himself together. "If I have broken his skull, how can I<br/>find out now? And what difference does it make now?" he added,<br/>hopelessly. "If I've killed him, I've killed himâ€¦ . You've come to<br/>grief, old man, so there you must lie!" he said aloud. And suddenly<br/>turning to the fence, he vaulted over it into the lane and fell to<br/>running- the handkerchief soaked with blood he held, crushed up in<br/>his right fist, and as he ran he thrust it into the back pocket of<br/>his coat. He ran headlong, and the few passers-by who met him in<br/>the dark, in the streets, remembered afterwards that they had met a<br/>man running that night. He flew back again to the widow Morozov's<br/>house.<br/><br/>Immediately after he had left it that evening, Fenya had rushed<br/>to the chief porter, Nazar Ivanovitch, and besought him, for<br/>Christ's sake, "not to let the captain in again to-day or<br/>to-morrow." Nazar Ivanovitch promised, but went upstairs to his<br/>mistress who had suddenly sent for him, and meeting his nephew, a<br/>boy of twenty, who had recently come from the country, on the way<br/>up told him to take his place, but forgot to mention "the captain."<br/>Mitya, running up to the gate, knocked. The lad instantly<br/>recognised him, for Mitya had more than once tipped him. Opening<br/>the gate at once, he let him in, and hastened to inform him with a<br/>good-humoured smile that "Agrafena Alexandrovna is not at home now,<br/>you know."<br/><br/>"Where is she then, Prohor?" asked Mitya, stopping short.<br/><br/>"She set off this evening, some two hours ago, with Timofey, to<br/>Mokroe."<br/><br/>"What for?" cried Mitya.<br/><br/>"That I can't say. To see some officer. Someone invited her and<br/>horses were sent to fetch her."<br/><br/>Mitya left him, and ran like a madman to Fenya.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
