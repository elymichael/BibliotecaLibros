Another Reputation Ruined


IT was not much more than three-quarters of a mile from the town
to the monastery. Alyosha walked quickly along the road, at that
hour deserted. It was almost night, and too dark to see anything
clearly at thirty paces ahead. There were cross-roads half-way. A
figure came into sight under a solitary willow at the cross-roads.
As soon as Alyosha reached the cross-roads the figure moved out and
rushed at him, shouting savagely:

"Your money or your life!"

"So it's you, Mitya," cried Alyosha, in surprise, violently
startled however.

"Ha ha ha! You didn't expect me? I wondered where to wait for
you. By her house? There are three ways from it, and I might have
missed you. At last I thought of waiting here, for you had to pass
here, there's no other way to the monastery. Come, tell me the
truth. Crush me like a beetle. But what's the matter?"

"Nothing, brother- it's the fright you gave me. Oh, Dmitri!
Father's blood just now." (Alyosha began to cry, he had been on the
verge of tears for a long time, and now something seemed to snap in
his soul.) "You almost killed him- cursed him- and now- here-
you're making jokes- 'Your money or your life!'"

"Well, what of that? It's not seemly- is that it? Not suitable
in my position?"

"No- I only-"
