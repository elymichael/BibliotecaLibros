<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>5<br/>The Grand Inquisitor<br/><br/><br/>"EVEN this must have a preface- that is, a literary preface,"<br/>laughed Ivan, "and I am a poor hand at making one. You see, my<br/>action takes place in the sixteenth century, and at that time, as<br/>you probably learnt at school, it was customary in poetry to bring<br/>down heavenly powers on earth. Not to speak of Dante, in France,<br/>clerks, as well as the monks in the monasteries, used to give<br/>regular performances in which the Madonna, the saints, the angels,<br/>Christ, and God Himself were brought on the stage. In those days it<br/>was done in all simplicity. In Victor Hugo's Notre Dame de Paris an<br/>edifying and gratuitous spectacle was provided for the people in<br/>the Hotel de Ville of Paris in the reign of Louis XI in honour of<br/>the birth of the dauphin. It was called Le bon jugement de la tres<br/>sainte et gracieuse Vierge Marie, and she appears herself on the<br/>stage and pronounces her bon jugement. Similar plays, chiefly from<br/>the Old Testament, were occasionally performed in Moscow too, up to<br/>the times of Peter the Great. But besides plays there were all<br/>sorts of legends and ballads scattered about the world, in which<br/>the saints and angels and all the powers of Heaven took part when<br/>required. In our monasteries the monks busied themselves in<br/>translating, copying, and even composing such poems- and even under<br/>the Tatars. There is, for instance, one such poem (of course, from<br/>the Greek), The Wanderings of Our Lady through Hell, with<br/>descriptions as bold as Dante's. Our Lady visits hell, and the<br/>Archangel Michael leads her through the torments. She sees the<br/>sinners and their punishment. There she sees among others one<br/>noteworthy set of sinners in a burning lake; some of them sink to<br/>the bottom of the lake so that they can't swim out, and 'these God<br/>forgets'- an expression of extraordinary depth and force. And so<br/>Our Lady, shocked and weeping, falls before the throne of God and<br/>begs for mercy for all in hell- for all she has seen there,<br/>indiscriminately. Her conversation with God is immensely<br/>interesting. She beseeches Him, she will not desist, and when God<br/>points to the hands and feet of her Son, nailed to the Cross, and<br/>asks, 'How can I forgive His tormentors?' she bids all the saints,<br/>all the martyrs, all the angels and archangels to fall down with<br/>her and pray for mercy on all without distinction. It ends by her<br/>winning from God a respite of suffering every year from Good Friday<br/>till Trinity Day, and the sinners at once raise a cry of<br/>thankfulness from hell, chanting, 'Thou art just, O Lord, in this<br/>judgment.' Well, my poem would have been of that kind if it had<br/>appeared at that time. He comes on the scene in my poem, but He<br/>says nothing, only appears and passes on. Fifteen centuries have<br/>passed since He promised to come in His glory, fifteen centuries<br/>since His prophet wrote, 'Behold, I come quickly'; 'Of that day and<br/>that hour knoweth no man, neither the Son, but the Father,' as He<br/>Himself predicted on earth. But humanity awaits him with the same<br/>faith and with the same love. Oh, with greater faith, for it is<br/>fifteen centuries since man has ceased to see signs from<br/>heaven.<br/><br/>/begin{verse<br/><br/>No signs from heaven come to-day<br/><br/>To add to what the heart doth say.<br/><br/>/<br/><br/>There was nothing left but faith in what the heart doth say. It<br/>is true there were many miracles in those days. There were saints<br/>who performed miraculous cures; some holy people, according to<br/>their biographies, were visited by the Queen of Heaven herself. But<br/>the devil did not slumber, and doubts were already arising among<br/>men of the truth of these miracles. And just then there appeared in<br/>the north of Germany a terrible new heresy. 'A huge star like to a<br/>torch' (that is, to a church) 'fell on the sources of the waters<br/>and they became bitter.' These heretics began blasphemously denying<br/>miracles. But those who remained faithful were all the more ardent<br/>in their faith. The tears of humanity rose up to Him as before,<br/>awaited His coming, loved Him, hoped for Him, yearned to suffer and<br/>die for Him as before. And so many ages mankind had prayed with<br/>faith and fervour, 'O Lord our God, hasten Thy coming'; so many<br/>ages called upon Him, that in His infinite mercy He deigned to come<br/>down to His servants. Before that day He had come down, He had<br/>visited some holy men, martyrs, and hermits, as is written in their<br/>lives. Among us, Tyutchev, with absolute faith in the truth of his<br/>words, bore witness that<br/><br/>/begin{verse<br/>
