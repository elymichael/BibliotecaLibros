<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>3<br/>Gold Mines<br/><br/><br/>THIS was the visit of Mitya of which Grushenka had spoken to<br/>Rakitin with such horror. She was just then expecting the<br/>"message," and was much relieved that Mitya had not been to see her<br/>that day or the day before. She hoped that "please God he won't<br/>come till I'm gone away," and he suddenly burst in on her. The rest<br/>we know already. To get him off her hands she suggested at once<br/>that he should walk with her to Samsonov's, where she said she<br/>absolutely must go "to settle his accounts," and when Mitya<br/>accompanied her at once, she said good-bye to him at the gate,<br/>making him promise to come at twelve o'clock to take her home<br/>again. Mitya, too, was delighted at this arrangement. If she was<br/>sitting at Samsonov's she could not be going to Fyodor<br/>Pavlovitch's, "if only she's not lying," he added at once. But he<br/>thought she was not lying from what he saw.<br/><br/>He was that sort of jealous man who, in the absence of the<br/>beloved woman, at once invents all sorts of awful fancies of what<br/>may be happening to her, and how she may be betraying him, but,<br/>when shaken, heartbroken, convinced of her faithlessness, he runs<br/>back to her, at the first glance at her face, her gay, laughing,<br/>affectionate face, he revives at once, lays aside all suspicion and<br/>with joyful shame abuses himself for his jealousy.<br/><br/>After leaving Grushenka at the gate he rushed home. Oh, he had<br/>so much still to do that day! But a load had been lifted from his<br/>heart, anyway.<br/><br/>"Now I must only make haste and find out from Smerdyakov whether<br/>anything happened there last night, whether, by any chance, she<br/>went to Fyodor Pavlovitch; ough!" floated through his mind.<br/><br/>Before he had time to reach his lodging, jealousy had surged up<br/>again in his restless heart.<br/><br/>Jealousy! "Othello was not jealous, he was trustful," observed<br/>Pushkin. And that remark alone is enough to show the deep insight<br/>of our great poet. Othello's soul was shattered and his whole<br/>outlook clouded simply because his ideal was destroyed. But Othello<br/>did not begin hiding, spying, peeping. He was trustful, on the<br/>contrary. He had to be led up, pushed on, excited with great<br/>difficulty before he could entertain the idea of deceit. The truly<br/>jealous man is not like that. It is impossible to picture to<br/>oneself the shame and moral degradation to which the jealous man<br/>can descend without a qualm of conscience. And yet it's not as<br/>though the jealous were all vulgar and base souls. On the contrary,<br/>a man of lofty feelings, whose love is pure and full of<br/>self-sacrifice, may yet hide under tables, bribe the vilest people,<br/>and be familiar with the lowest ignominy of spying and<br/>eavesdropping.<br/><br/>Othello was incapable of making up his mind to faithlessness-<br/>not incapable of forgiving it, but of making up his mind to it-<br/>though his soul was as innocent and free from malice as a babe's.<br/>It is not so with the really jealous man. It is hard to imagine<br/>what some jealous men can make up their mind to and overlook, and<br/>what they can forgive! The jealous are the readiest of all to<br/>forgive, and all women know it. The jealous man can forgive<br/>extraordinarily quickly (though, of course, after a violent scene),<br/>and he is able to forgive infidelity almost conclusively proved,<br/>the very kisses and embraces he has seen, if only he can somehow be<br/>convinced that it has all been "for the last time," and that his<br/>rival will vanish from that day forward, will depart to the ends of<br/>the earth, or that he himself will carry her away somewhere, where<br/>that dreaded rival will not get near her. Of course the<br/>reconciliation is only for an hour. For, even if the rival did<br/>disappear next day, he would invent another one and would be<br/>jealous of him. And one might wonder what there was in a love that<br/>had to be so watched over, what a love could be worth that needed<br/>such strenuous guarding. But that the jealous will never<br/>understand. And yet among them are men of noble hearts. It is<br/>remarkable, too, that those very men of noble hearts, standing<br/>hidden in some cupboard, listening and spying, never feel the<br/>stings of conscience at that moment, anyway, though they understand<br/>clearly enough with their "noble hearts" the shameful depths to<br/>which they have voluntarily sunk.<br/>
