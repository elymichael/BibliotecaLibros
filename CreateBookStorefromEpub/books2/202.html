<br/>Fathers and teachers, forgive me and don't be angry, that like a<br/>little child I've been babbling of what you know long ago, and can<br/>teach me a hundred times more skilfully. I only speak from rapture,<br/>and forgive my tears, for I love the Bible. Let him too weep, the<br/>priest of God, and be sure that the hearts of his listeners will<br/>throb in response. Only a little tiny seed is needed- drop it into<br/>the heart of the peasant and it won't die, it will live in his soul<br/>all his life, it will be hidden in the midst of his darkness and<br/>sin, like a bright spot, like a great reminder. And there's no need<br/>of much teaching or explanation, he will understand it all simply.<br/>Do you suppose that the peasants don't understand? Try reading them<br/>the touching story of the fair Esther and the haughty Vashti; or<br/>the miraculous story of Jonah in the whale. Don't forget either the<br/>parables of Our Lord, choose especially from the Gospel of St. Luke<br/>(that is what I did), and then from the Acts of the Apostles the<br/>conversion of St. Paul (that you mustn't leave out on any account),<br/>and from the Lives of the Saints, for instance, the life of Alexey,<br/>the man of God and, greatest of all, the happy martyr and the seer<br/>of God, Mary of Egypt- and you will penetrate their hearts with<br/>these simple tales. Give one hour a week to it in spite of your<br/>poverty, only one little hour. And you will see for yourselves that<br/>our people is gracious and grateful, and will repay you a hundred<br/>foId. Mindful of the kindness of their priest and the moving words<br/>they have heard from him, they will of their own accord help him in<br/>his fields and in his house and will treat him with more respect<br/>than before- so that it will even increase his worldly well-being<br/>too. The thing is so simple that sometimes one is even afraid to<br/>put it into words, for fear of being laughed at, and yet how true<br/>it is! One who does not believe in God will not believe in God's<br/>people. He who believes in God's people will see His Holiness too,<br/>even though he had not believed in it till then. Only the people<br/>and their future spiritual power will convert our atheists, who<br/>have torn themselves away from their native soil.<br/><br/>And what is the use of Christ's words, unless we set an example?<br/>The people is lost without the Word of God, for its soul is athirst<br/>for the Word and for all that is good.<br/><br/>In my youth, long ago, nearly forty years ago, I travelled all<br/>over Russia with Father Anfim, collecting funds for our monastery,<br/>and we stayed one night on the bank of a great navigable river with<br/>some fishermen. A good looking peasant lad, about eighteen, joined<br/>us; he had to hurry back next morning to pull a merchant's barge<br/>along the bank. I noticed him looking straight before him with<br/>clear and tender eyes. It was a bright, warm, still, July night, a<br/>cool mist rose from the broad river, we could hear the plash of a<br/>fish, the birds were still, all was hushed and beautiful,<br/>everything praying to God. Only we two were not sleeping, the lad<br/>and I, and we talked of the beauty of this world of God's and of<br/>the great mystery of it. Every blade of grass, every insect, ant,<br/>and golden bee, all so marvellously know their path, though they<br/>have not intelligence, they bear witness to the mystery of God and<br/>continually accomplish it themselves. I saw the dear lad's heart<br/>was moved. He told me that he loved the forest and the forest<br/>birds. He was a bird-catcher, knew the note of each of them, could<br/>call each bird. "I know nothing better than to be in the forest,"<br/>said he, "though all things are good."<br/><br/>"Truly," I answered him, "all things are good and fair, because<br/>all is truth. Look," said I, "at the horse, that great beast that<br/>is so near to man; or the lowly, pensive ox, which feeds him and<br/>works for him; look at their faces, what meekness, what devotion to<br/>man, who often beats them mercilessly. What gentleness, what<br/>confidence and what beauty! It's touching to know that there's no<br/>sin in them, for all, all except man, is sinless, and Christ has<br/>been with them before us."<br/><br/>"Why," asked the boy, "is Christ with them too?"<br/><br/>"It cannot but be so," said I, "since the Word is for all. All<br/>creation and all creatures, every leaf is striving to the Word,<br/>singing glory to God, weeping to Christ, unconsciously<br/>accomplishing this by the mystery of their sinless life. Yonder,"<br/>said I, "in the forest wanders the dreadful bear, fierce and<br/>menacing, and yet innocent in it." And I told him how once a bear<br/>came to a great saint who had taken refuge in a tiny cell in the<br/>wood. And the great saint pitied him, went up to him without fear<br/>and gave him a piece of bread. "Go along," said he, "Christ be with<br/>you," and the savage beast walked away meekly and obediently, doing<br/>no harm. And the lad was delighted that the bear had walked away<br/>without hurting the saint, and that Christ was with him too. "Ah,"<br/>said he, "how good that is, how good and beautiful is all God's<br/>work!" He sat musing softly and sweetly. I saw he understood. And<br/>he slept beside me a light and sinless sleep. May God bless youth!<br/>And I prayed for him as I went to sleep. Lord, send peace and light<br/>to Thy people!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
