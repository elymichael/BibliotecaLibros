"I'm loading the pistol."<br/><br/>Unfastening the pistol-case, Mitya actually opened the powder<br/>horn, and carefully sprinkled and rammed in the charge. Then he<br/>took the bullet and, before inserting it, held it in two fingers in<br/>front of the candle.<br/><br/>"Why are you looking at the bullet?" asked Pyotr Ilyitch,<br/>watching him with uneasy curiosity.<br/><br/>"Oh, a fancy. Why, if you meant to put that bullet in your<br/>brain, would you look at it or not?"<br/><br/>"Why look at it?"<br/><br/>"It's going into my brain, so it's interesting to look and see<br/>what it's like. But that's foolishness, a moment's foolishness. Now<br/>that's done," he added, putting in the bullet and driving it home<br/>with the ramrod. "Pyotr Ilyitch, my dear fellow, that's nonsense,<br/>all nonsense, and if only you knew what nonsense!

That's right."<br/><br/>And taking a pen from the table, Mitya rapidly wrote two lines,<br/>folded the paper in four, and thrust it in his waistcoat pocket. He<br/>put the pistols in the case, locked it up, and kept it in his hand.<br/>Then he looked at Pyotr Ilyitch with a slow, thoughtful smile.<br/><br/>"Now, let's go."<br/><br/>"Where are we going? No, wait a minuteâ€¦ . Are you thinking of<br/>putting that bullet in your brain, perhaps?" Pyotr Ilyitch asked<br/>uneasily.<br/>
