Alyosha went, opened the door, and reported that no one was
listening.

"Come here, Alexey Fyodorovitch," Lise went on, flushing redder
and redder. "Give me your hand- that's right. I have to make a
great confession. I didn't write to you yesterday in joke, but in
earnest," and she hid her eyes with her hand. It was evident that
she was greatly ashamed of the confession.

Suddenly she snatched his hand and impulsively kissed it three
times.

"Ah, Lise, what a good thing!" cried Alyosha joyfully. "You
know, I was perfectly sure you were in earnest."

"Sure? Upon my word! She put aside his hand, but did not leave
go of it, blushing hotly, and laughing a little happy laugh. "I
kiss his hand and he says, 'What a good thing!'"

But her reproach was undeserved. Alyosha, too, was greatly
overcome.

"I should like to please you always, Lise, but don't know how to
do it." he muttered, blushing too.

"Alyosha, dear, you are cold and rude. Do you see? He has chosen
me as his wife and is quite settled about it. He is sure I was in
earnest. What a thing to say! Why, that's impertinence- that's what
it is."

"Why, was it wrong of me to feel sure?" Alyosha asked, laughing
suddenly.

"Ah, Alyosha, on the contrary, it was delightfully right," cried
Lise, looking tenderly and happily at him.
