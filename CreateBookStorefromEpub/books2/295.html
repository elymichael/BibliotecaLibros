<br/>"Glory be to God in Heaven,<br/><br/>Glory be to God in me…<br/><br/>"That verse came from my heart once, it's not a verse, but a<br/>tear… . I made it myself… not while I was pulling the captain's<br/>beard, though… "<br/><br/>"Why do you bring him in all of a sudden?"<br/><br/>"Why do I bring him in? Foolery! All things come to an end; all<br/>things are made equal. That's the long and short of it."<br/><br/>"You know, I keep thinking of your pistols."<br/><br/>"That's all foolery, too! Drink, and don't be fanciful. I love<br/>life. I've loved life too much, shamefully much. Enough! Let's<br/>drink to life, dear boy, I propose the toast. Why am I pleased with<br/>myself? I'm a scoundrel, but I'm satisfied with myself. And yet I'm<br/>tortured by the thought that I'm a scoundrel, but satisfied with<br/>myself. I bless the creation. I'm ready to bless God and His<br/>creation directly, but… I must kill one noxious insect for fear it<br/>should crawl and spoil life for others… . Let us drink to life,<br/>dear brother. What can be more precious than life? Nothing! To<br/>life, and to one queen of queens!"<br/><br/>"Let's drink to life and to your queen, too, if you like."<br/><br/>They drank a glass each. Although Mitya was excited and<br/>expansive, yet he was melancholy, too. It was as though some heavy,<br/>overwhelming anxiety were weighing upon him.<br/><br/>"Misha… here's your Misha come! Misha, come here, my boy, drink<br/>this glass to Phoebus the golden-haired, of to-morrow morn… "<br/><br/>
