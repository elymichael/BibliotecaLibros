"Where did you get the material, that is, the rag in which you
sewed the money?"

"Are you laughing at me?"

"Not at all. And we are in no mood for laughing, Dmitri
Fyodorovitch."

"I don't know where I got the rag from- somewhere, I
suppose."

"I should have thought you couldn't have forgotten it?"

"Upon my word, I don't remember. I might have torn a bit off my
linen."

"That's very interesting. We might find in your lodgings
to-morrow the shirt or whatever it is from which you tore the rag.
What sort of rag was it, cloth or linen?"

"Goodness only knows what it was. Wait a bit… I believe I didn't
tear it off anything. It was a bit of calico… . I believe I sewed
it up in a cap of my landlady's."

"In your landlady's cap?"

"Yes. I took it from her."

"How did you get it?"
