<br/>"They have been playing, but they've left off. They've been<br/>drinking tea, the official gentleman asked for liqueurs."<br/><br/>"Stay, Trifon Borissovitch, stay, my good soul, I'll see for<br/>myself. Now answer one more question: are the gypsies here?"<br/><br/>"You can't have the gypsies now, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. The<br/>authorities have sent them away. But we've Jews that play the<br/>cymbals and the fiddle in the village, so one might send for them.<br/>They'd come."<br/><br/>"Send for them. Certainly send for them!" cried Mitya. "And you<br/>can get the girls together as you did then, Marya especially,<br/>Stepanida, too, and Arina. Two hundred roubles for a chorus!"<br/><br/>"Oh, for a sum like that I can get all the village together,<br/>though by now they're asleep. Are the peasants here worth such<br/>kindness, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, or the girls either? To spend a sum<br/>like that on such coarseness and rudeness! What's the good of<br/>giving a peasant a cigar to smoke, the stinking ruffian! And the<br/>girls are all lousy. Besides, I'll get my daughters up for nothing,<br/>let alone a sum like that. They've only just gone to bed, I'll give<br/>them a kick and set them singing for you. You gave the peasants<br/>champagne to drink the other day, e-ech!"<br/><br/>For all his pretended compassion for Mitya, Trifon Borissovitch<br/>had hidden half a dozen bottles of champagne on that last occasion,<br/>and had picked up a hundred-rouble note under the table, and it had<br/>remained in his clutches.<br/><br/>"Trifon Borissovitch, I sent more than one thousand flying last<br/>time I was here. Do you remember?"<br/><br/>"You did send it flying. I may well remember. You must have left<br/>three thousand behind you."<br/><br/>"Well, I've come to do the same again, do you see?"<br/><br/>And he pulled out his roll of notes, and held them up before the<br/>innkeeper's nose.<br/><br/>
