"And in all nature there was naught<br/><br/>That could find favour in his eyes- or rather in the feminine-<br/>that could find favour in her eyes- . But now let me present you to<br/>my wife, Arina Petrovna. She is crippled, she is forty-three; she<br/>can move, but very little. She is of humble origin. Arina Petrovna,<br/>compose your countenance. This is Alexey Fyodorovitch Karamazov.<br/>Get up, Alexey Fyodorovitch." He took him by the hand and with<br/>unexpected force pulled him up. "You must stand up to be introduced<br/>to a lady. It's not the Karamazov, mamma, who… h'm… etcetera, but<br/>his brother, radiant with modest virtues. Come, Arina Petrovna,<br/>come, mamma, first your hand to be kissed."<br/><br/>And he kissed his wife's hand respectfully and even tenderly.<br/>The girl at the window turned her back indignantly on the scene; an<br/>expression of extraordinary cordiality came over the haughtily<br/>inquiring face of the woman.<br/><br/>"Good morning! Sit down, Mr. Tchernomazov," she said.<br/><br/>"Karamazov, mamma, Karamazov. We are of humble origin," he<br/>whispered again.<br/><br/>"Well, Karamazov, or whatever it is, but I always think of<br/>Tchermomazov… . Sit down. Why has he pulled you up? He calls me<br/>crippled, but I am not, only my legs are swollen like barrels, and<br/>I am shrivelled up myself. Once I used to be so fat, but now it's<br/>as though I had swallowed a needle."<br/><br/>"We are of humble origin," the captain muttered again.<br/><br/>"Oh, father, father!" the hunchback girl, who had till then been<br/>silent on her chair, said suddenly, and she hid her eyes in her<br/>handkerchief.<br/><br/>"Buffoon!" blurted out the girl at the window.<br/><br/>"Have you heard our news?" said the mother, pointing at her<br/>daughters. "It's like clouds coming over; the clouds pass and we<br/>have music again. When we were with the army, we used to have many<br/>such guests. I don't mean to make any comparisons; everyone to<br/>their taste. The deacon's wife used to come then and say, 'Alexandr<br/>Alexandrovitch is a man of the noblest heart, but Nastasya<br/>Petrovna,' she would say, 'is of the brood of hell.' 'Well,' I<br/>said, 'that's a matter of taste; but you are a little spitfire.'<br/>'And you want keeping in your place;' says she. 'You black sword,'<br/>said I, 'who asked you to teach me?' 'But my breath,' says she, 'is<br/>clean, and yours is unclean.' 'You ask all the officers whether my<br/>breath is unclean.' And ever since then I had it in my mind. Not<br/>long ago I was sitting here as I am now, when I saw that very<br/>general come in who came here for Easter, and I asked him: 'Your<br/>Excellency,' said I, 'can a lady's breath be unpleasant?' 'Yes,' he<br/>answered; 'you ought to open a window-pane or open the door, for<br/>the air is not fresh here.' And they all go on like that! And what<br/>is my breath to them? The dead smell worse still!. 'I won't spoil<br/>the air,' said I, 'I'll order some slippers and go away.' My<br/>darlings, don't blame your own mother! Nikolay Ilyitch, how is it I<br/>can't please you? There's only Ilusha who comes home from school<br/>and loves me. Yesterday he brought me an apple. Forgive your own<br/>mother- forgive a poor lonely creature! Why has my breath become<br/>unpleasant to you?"<br/><br/>And the poor mad woman broke into sobs, and tears streamed down<br/>her cheeks. The captain rushed up to her.<br/>
