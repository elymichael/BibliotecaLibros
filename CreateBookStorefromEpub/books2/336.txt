"I'm weak… " she said in an exhausted voice. "Forgive me… . I'm
weak, I can't… . I'm sorry."

She bowed to the chorus, and then began bowing in all
directions.

"I'm sorry… . Forgive me… "

"The lady's been drinking. The pretty lady has been drinking,"
voices were heard saying.

"The lady's drunk too much," Maximov explained to the girls,
giggling.

"Mitya, lead me away… take me," said Grushenka helplessly. Mitya
pounced on her, snatched her up in his arms, and carried the
precious burden through the curtains.

"Well, now I'll go," thought Kalganov, and walking out of the
blue room, he closed the two halves of the door after him. But the
orgy in the larger room went on and grew louder and louder. Mitya
laid Grushenka on the bed and kissed her on the lips.

"Don't touch me… " she faltered, in an imploring voice. "Don't
touch me, till I'm yours… . I've told you I'm yours, but don't
touch me… spare me… . With them here, with them close, you mustn't.
He's here. It's nasty here… "

"I'll obey you! I won't think of it… I worship you!" muttered
Mitya. "Yes, it's nasty here, it's abominable."

And still holding her in his arms, he sank on his knees by the
bedside.
