<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>1<br/>Father Ferapont<br/><br/><br/>ALYOSHA was roused early, before daybreak. Father Zossima woke<br/>up feeling very weak, though he wanted to get out of bed and sit up<br/>in a chair. His mind was quite clear; his face looked very tired,<br/>yet bright and almost joyful. It wore an expression of gaiety,<br/>kindness and cordiality. "Maybe I shall not live through the coming<br/>day," he said to Alyosha. Then he desired to confess and take the<br/>sacrament at once. He always confessed to Father Paissy. After<br/>taking the communion, the service of extreme unction followed. The<br/>monks assembled and the cell was gradually filled up by the inmates<br/>of the hermitage. Meantime it was daylight. People began coming<br/>from the monastery. After the service was over the elder desired to<br/>kiss and take leave of everyone. As the cell was so small the<br/>earlier visitors withdrew to make room for others. Alyosha stood<br/>beside the elder, who was seated again in his arm-chair. He talked<br/>as much as he could. Though his voice was weak, it was fairly<br/>steady.<br/><br/>"I've been teaching you so many years, and therefore I've been<br/>talking aloud so many years, that I've got into the habit of<br/>talking, and so much so that it's almost more difficult for me to<br/>hold my tongue than to talk, even now, in spite of my weakness,<br/>dear Fathers and brothers," he jested, looking with emotion at the<br/>group round him.<br/><br/>Alyosha remembered afterwards something of what he said to them.<br/>But though he spoke out distinctly and his voice was fairly steady,<br/>his speech was somewhat disconnected. He spoke of many things, he<br/>seemed anxious before the moment of death to say everything he had<br/>not said in his life, and not simply for the sake of instructing<br/>them, but as though thirsting to share with all men and all<br/>creation his joy and ecstasy, and once more in his life to open his<br/>whole heart.<br/><br/>"Love one another, Fathers," said Father Zossima, as far as<br/>Alyosha could remember afterwards. "Love God's people. Because we<br/>have come here and shut ourselves within these walls, we are no<br/>holier than those that are outside, but on the contrary, from the<br/>very fact of coming here, each of us has confessed to himself that<br/>he is worse than others, than all men on earth… . And the longer<br/>the monk lives in his seclusion, the more keenly he must recognise<br/>that. Else he would have had no reason to come here. When he<br/>realises that he is not only worse than others, but that he is<br/>responsible to all men for all and everything, for all human sins,<br/>national and individual, only then the aim of our seclusion is<br/>attained. For know, dear ones, that every one of us is undoubtedly<br/>responsible for all men- and everything on earth, not merely<br/>through the general sinfulness of creation, but each one personally<br/>for all mankind and every individual man. This knowledge is the<br/>crown of life for the monk and for every man. For monks are not a<br/>special sort of men, but only what all men ought to be. Only<br/>through that knowledge, our heart grows soft with infinite,<br/>universal, inexhaustible love. Then every one of you will have the<br/>power to win over the whole world by love and to wash away the sins<br/>of the world with your tears… .Each of you keep watch over your<br/>heart and confess your sins to yourself unceasingly. Be not afraid<br/>of your sins, even when perceiving them, if only there be<br/>penitence, but make no conditions with God. Again, I say, be not<br/>proud. Be proud neither to the little nor to the great. Hate not<br/>those who reject you, who insult you, who abuse and slander you.<br/>Hate not the atheists, the teachers of evil, the materialists- and<br/>I mean not only the good ones- for there are many good ones among<br/>them, especially in our day- hate not even the wicked ones.<br/>Remember them in your prayers thus: Save, O Lord, all those who<br/>have none to pray for them, save too all those who will not pray.<br/>And add: it is not in pride that I make this prayer, O Lord, for I<br/>am lower than all men… . Love God's people, let not strangers draw<br/>away the flock, for if you slumber in your slothfulness and<br/>disdainful pride, or worse still, in covetousness, they will come<br/>from all sides and draw away your flock. Expound the Gospel to the<br/>people unceasingly… be not extortionate… . Do not love gold and<br/>silver, do not hoard them… . Have faith. Cling to the banner and<br/>raise it on high."<br/><br/>But the elder spoke more disconnectedly than Alyosha reported<br/>his words afterwards. Sometimes he broke off altogether, as though<br/>to take breath and recover his strength, but he was in a sort of<br/>ecstasy. They heard him with emotion, though many wondered at his<br/>words and found them obscure… . Afterwards all remembered those<br/>words.<br/><br/>When Alyosha happened for a moment to leave the cell, he was<br/>struck by the general excitement and suspense in the monks who were<br/>crowding about it. This anticipation showed itself in some by<br/>anxiety, in others by devout solemnity. All were expecting that<br/>some marvel would happen immediately after the elder's death. Their<br/>suspense was, from one point of view, almost frivolous, but even<br/>the most austere of the monks were affected by it. Father Paissy's<br/>face looked the gravest of all.<br/><br/>Alyosha was mysteriously summoned by a monk to see Rakitin, who<br/>had arrived from town with a singular letter for him from Madame<br/>Hohlakov. In it she informed Alyosha of a strange and very<br/>opportune incident. It appeared that among the women who had come<br/>on the previous day to receive Father Zossima's blessing, there had<br/>been an old woman from the town, a sergeant's widow, called<br/>Prohorovna. She had inquired whether she might pray for the rest of<br/>the soul of her son, Vassenka, who had gone to Irkutsk, and had<br/>sent her no news for over a year. To which Father Zossima had<br/>answered sternly, forbidding her to do so, and saying that to pray<br/>for the living as though they were dead was a kind of sorcery. He<br/>afterwards forgave her on account of her ignorance, and added, "as<br/>though reading the book of the future" (this was Madame Hohlakov's<br/>expression), words of comfort: "that her son Vassya was certainly<br/>alive and he would either come himself very shortly or send a<br/>letter, and that she was to go home and expect him." And "Would you<br/>believe it?" exclaimed Madame Hohlakov enthusiastically, "the<br/>prophecy has been fulfilled literally indeed, and more than that."<br/>Scarcely had the old woman reached home when they gave her a letter<br/>from Siberia which had been awaiting her. But that was not all; in<br/>the letter written on the road from Ekaterinenburg, Vassya informed<br/>his mother that he was returning to Russia with an official, and<br/>that three weeks after her receiving the letter he hoped "to<br/>embrace his mother."<br/>
