"Mother never does whip us," Nastya observed at once.<br/><br/>"I know, I only said it to finish the sentence. And don't you<br/>ever deceive your mother except just this once, until I come back.<br/>And so, kiddies, can I go out? You won't be frightened and cry when<br/>I'm gone?"<br/><br/>"We sha-all cry," drawled Kostya, on the verge of tears<br/>already.<br/><br/>"We shall cry, we shall be sure to cry," Nastya chimed in with<br/>timid haste.<br/><br/>"Oh, children, children, how fraught with peril are your years!<br/>There's no help for it, chickens; I shall have to stay with you I<br/>don't know how long. And time is passing, time is passing,<br/>oogh!"<br/><br/>"Tell Perezvon to pretend to be dead!" Kostya begged.<br/><br/>"There's no help for it, we must have recourse to Perezvon. Ici,<br/>Perezvon." And Kolya began giving orders to the dog, who performed<br/>all his tricks.<br/><br/>He was a rough-haired dog, of medium size, with a coat of a sort<br/>of lilac-grey colour. He was blind in his right eye, and his left<br/>ear was torn. He whined and jumped, stood and walked on his hind<br/>legs, lay on his back with his paws in the air, rigid as though he<br/>were dead. While this last performance was going on, the door<br/>opened and Agafya, Madame Krassotkin's servant, a stout woman of<br/>forty, marked with small-pox, appeared in the doorway. She had come<br/>back from market and had a bag full of provisions in her hand.<br/>Holding up the bag of provisions in her left hand she stood still<br/>to watch the dog. Though Kolya had been so anxious for her return,<br/>he did not cut short the performance, and after keeping Perezvon<br/>dead for the usual time, at last he whistled to him. The dog jumped<br/>up and began bounding about in his joy at having done his duty.<br/><br/>"Only think, a dog!" Agafya observed sententiously.<br/><br/>"Why are you late, female?" asked Krassotkin sternly.<br/><br/>"Female, indeed! Go on with you, you brat."<br/>
