<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>4<br/>Cana of Galilee<br/><br/><br/>IT was very late, according to the monastery ideas, when Alyosha<br/>returned to the hermitage; the door-keeper let him in by a special<br/>entrance. It had struck nine o'clock- the hour of rest and repose<br/>after a day of such agitation for all. Alyosha timidly opened the<br/>door and went into the elder's cell where his coffin was now<br/>standing. There was no one in the cell but Father Paissy, reading<br/>the Gospel in solitude over the coffin, and the young novice<br/>Porfiry, who, exhausted by the previous night's conversation and<br/>the disturbing incidents of the day, was sleeping the deep sound<br/>sleep of youth on the floor of the other room. Though Father Paissy<br/>heard Alyosha come in, he did not even look in his direction.<br/>Alyosha turned to the right from the door to the corner, fell on<br/>his knees and began to pray.<br/><br/>His soul was overflowing but with mingled feelings; no single<br/>sensation stood out distinctly; on the contrary, one drove out<br/>another in a slow, continual rotation. But there was a sweetness in<br/>his heart and, strange to say, Alyosha was not surprised at it.<br/>Again he saw that coffin before him, the hidden dead figure so<br/>precious to him, but the weeping and poignant grief of the morning<br/>was no longer aching in his soul. As soon as he came in, he fell<br/>down before the coffin as before a holy shrine, but joy, joy was<br/>glowing in his mind and in his heart. The one window of the cell<br/>was open, the air was fresh and cool. "So the smell must have<br/>become stronger, if they opened the window," thought Alyosha. But<br/>even this thought of the smell of corruption, which had seemed to<br/>him so awful and humiliating a few hours before, no longer made him<br/>feel miserable or indignant. He began quietly praying, but he soon<br/>felt that he was praying almost mechanically. Fragments of thought<br/>floated through his soul, flashed like stars and went out again at<br/>once, to be succeeded by others. But yet there was reigning in his<br/>soul a sense of the wholeness of things- something steadfast and<br/>comforting- and he was aware of it himself. Sometimes he began<br/>praying ardently, he longed to pour out his thankfulness and<br/>love…<br/><br/>But when he had begun to pray, he passed suddenly to something<br/>else, and sank into thought, forgetting both the prayer and what<br/>had interrupted it. He began listening to what Father Paissy was<br/>reading, but worn out with exhaustion he gradually began to<br/>doze.<br/><br/>"And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee,"<br/>read Father Paissy. "And the mother of Jesus was there; And both<br/>Jesus was there; And both Jesus was called, and his disciples, to<br/>the marriage."<br/><br/>"Marriage? What's that?… A marriage!" floated whirling through<br/>Alyosha's mind. "There is happiness for her, too… She has gone to<br/>the feast… . No, she has not taken the knife… . That was only a<br/>tragic phrase… . Well… tragic phrases should be forgiven, they must<br/>be. Tragic phrases comfort the heart… Without them, sorrow would be<br/>too heavy for men to bear. Rakitin has gone off to the back alley.<br/>As long as Rakitin broods over his wrongs, he will always go off to<br/>the back alley… . But the high road… The road is wide and straight<br/>and bright as crystal, and the sun is at the end of it… . Ah!…<br/>What's being read?"…<br/><br/>"And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith unto him,<br/>They have no wine"… Alyosha heard.<br/><br/>"Ah, yes, I was missing that, and I didn't want to miss it, I<br/>love that passage: it's Cana of Galilee, the first miracle… . Ah,<br/>that miracle! Ah, that sweet miracle! It was not men's grief, but<br/>their joy Christ visited, He worked His first miracle to help men's<br/>gladness… . 'He who loves men loves their gladness, too'… He was<br/>always repeating that, it was one of his leading ideas… 'There's no<br/>living without joy,' Mitya says… . Yes, Mitya… . 'Everything that<br/>is true and good is always full of forgiveness,' he used to say<br/>that, too"…<br/>
