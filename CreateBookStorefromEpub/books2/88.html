<br/>"Why are your fits getting worse?" asked Fyodor Pavlovitch,<br/>looking askance at his new cook. "Would you like to get married?<br/>Shall I find you a wife?"<br/><br/>But Smerdyakov turned pale with anger, and made no reply. Fyodor<br/>Pavlovitch left him with an impatient gesture. The great thing was<br/>that he had absolute confidence in his honesty. It happened once,<br/>when Fyodor Pavlovitch was drunk, that he dropped in the muddy<br/>courtyard three hundred-rouble notes which he had only just<br/>received. He only missed them next day, and was just hastening to<br/>search his pockets when he saw the notes lying on the table. Where<br/>had they come from? Smerdyakov had picked them up and brought them<br/>in the day before.<br/><br/>"Well, my lad, I've never met anyone like you," Fyodor<br/>Pavlovitch said shortly, and gave him ten roubles. We may add that<br/>he not only believed in his honesty, but had, for some reason, a<br/>liking for him, although the young man looked as morosely at him as<br/>at everyone and was always silent. He rarely spoke. If it had<br/>occurred to anyone to wonder at the time what the young man was<br/>interested in, and what was in his mind, it would have been<br/>impossible to tell by looking at him. Yet he used sometimes to stop<br/>suddenly in the house, or even in the yard or street, and would<br/>stand still for ten minutes, lost in thought. A physiognomist<br/>studying his face would have said that there was no thought in it,<br/>no reflection, but only a sort of contemplation. There is a<br/>remarkable picture by the painter Kramskoy, called "Contemplation."<br/>There is a forest in winter, and on a roadway through the forest,<br/>in absolute solitude, stands a peasant in a torn kaftan and bark<br/>shoes. He stands, as it were, lost in thought. Yet he is not<br/>thinking; he is "contemplating." If anyone touched him he would<br/>start and look at one as though awakening and bewildered. It's true<br/>he would come to himself immediately; but if he were asked what he<br/>had been thinking about, he would remember nothing. Yet probably he<br/>has, hidden within himself, the impression which had dominated him<br/>during the period of contemplation. Those impressions are dear to<br/>him and no doubt he hoards them imperceptibly, and even<br/>unconsciously. How and why, of course, he does not know either. He<br/>may suddenly, after hoarding impressions for many years, abandon<br/>everything and go off to Jerusalem on a pilgrimage for his soul's<br/>salvation, or perhaps he will suddenly set fire to his native<br/>village, and perhaps do both. There are a good many<br/>"contemplatives" among the peasantry. Well, Smerdyakov was probably<br/>one of them, and he probably was greedily hoarding up his<br/>impressions, hardly knowing why.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
