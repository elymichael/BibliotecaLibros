"Why, they're poor people, burnt out. They've no bread. They're<br/>begging because they've been burnt out."<br/><br/>"No, no," Mitya, as it were, still did not understand. "Tell me<br/>why it is those poor mothers stand there? Why are people poor? Why<br/>is the babe poor? Why is the steppe barren? Why don't they hug each<br/>other and kiss? Why don't they sing songs of joy? Why are they so<br/>dark from black misery? Why don't they feed the babe?"<br/><br/>And he felt that, though his questions were unreasonable and<br/>senseless, yet he wanted to ask just that, and he had to ask it<br/>just in that way. And he felt that a passion of pity, such as he<br/>had never known before, was rising in his heart, that he wanted to<br/>cry, that he wanted to do something for them all, so that the babe<br/>should weep no more, so that the dark-faced, dried-up mother should<br/>not weep, that no one should shed tears again from that moment, and<br/>he wanted to do it at once, at once, regardless of all obstacles,<br/>with all the recklessness of the Karamazovs.<br/><br/>"And I'm coming with you. I won't leave you now for the rest of<br/>my life, I'm coming with you", he heard close beside him<br/>Grushenka's tender voice, thrilling with emotion. And his heart<br/>glowed, and he struggled forward towards the light, and he longed<br/>to live, to live, to go on and on, towards the new, beckoning<br/>light, and to hasten, hasten, now, at once! "What! Where?" he<br/>exclaimed opening his eyes, and sitting up on the chest, as though<br/>he had revived from a swoon, smiling brightly. Nikolay Parfenovitch<br/>was standing over him, suggesting that he should hear the protocol<br/>read aloud and sign it. Mitya guessed that he had been asleep an<br/>hour or more, but he did not hear Nikolay Parfenovitch. He was<br/>suddenly struck by the fact that there was a pillow under his head,<br/>which hadn't been there when he had leant back, exhausted, on the<br/>chest.<br/><br/>"Who put that pillow under my head? Who was so kind?" he cried,<br/>with a sort of ecstatic gratitude, and tears in his voice, as<br/>though some great kindness had been shown him.<br/><br/>He never found out who this kind man was; perhaps one of the<br/>peasant witnesses, or Nikolay Parfenovitch's little secretary, had<br/>compassionately thought to put a pillow under his head; but his<br/>whole soul was quivering with tears. He went to the table and said<br/>that he would sign whatever they liked.<br/><br/>"I've had a good dream, gentlemen," he said in a strange voice,<br/>with a new light, as of joy, in his face.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
