"He listened and said nothing. He told me that he had already<br/>formed his opinion. But he promised to give my words<br/>consideration."<br/><br/>"Consideration! Ah, they are swindlers! They'll ruin him. And<br/>why did she send for the doctor?"<br/><br/>"As an expert. They want to prove that Mitya's mad and committed<br/>the murder when he didn't know what he was doing," Alyosha smiled<br/>gently, "but Mitya won't agree to that."<br/><br/>"Yes; but that would be the truth if he had killed him!" cried<br/>Grushenka. "He was mad then, perfectly mad, and that was my fault,<br/>wretch that I am! But, of course, he didn't do it, he didn't do it!<br/>And they are all against him, the whole town. Even Fenya's evidence<br/>went to prove he had done it. And the people at the shop, and that<br/>official, and at the tavern, too, before, people had heard him say<br/>so! They are all, all against him, all crying out against him."<br/><br/>"Yes, there's a fearful accumulation of evidence," Alyosha<br/>observed grimly.<br/><br/>"And Grigory- Grigory Vassilyevitch- sticks to his story that<br/>the door was open, persists that he saw it- there's no shaking him.<br/>I went and talked to him myself. He's rude about it, too."<br/><br/>"Yes, that's perhaps the strongest evidence against him," said<br/>Alyosha.<br/><br/>"And as for Mitya's being mad, he certainly seems like it now,"<br/>Grushenka began with a peculiarly anxious and mysterious air. "Do<br/>you know, Alyosha, I've been wanting to talk to you about it for a<br/>long time. I go to him every day and simply wonder at him. Tell me,<br/>now, what do you suppose he's always talking about? He talks and<br/>talks and I can make nothing of it. I fancied he was talking of<br/>something intellectual that I couldn't understand in my<br/>foolishness. Only he suddenly began talking to me about a babe-<br/>that is, about some child. 'Why is the babe poor?' he said. 'It's<br/>for that babe I am going to Siberia now. I am not a murderer, but I<br/>must go to Siberia!' What that meant, what babe, I couldn't tell<br/>for the life of me. Only I cried when he said it, because he said<br/>it so nicely. He cried himself, and I cried, too. He suddenly<br/>kissed me and made the sign of the cross over me. What did it mean,<br/>Alyosha, tell me? What is this babe?"<br/><br/>"It must be Rakitin, who's been going to see him lately," smiled<br/>Alyosha, "thoughâ€¦ that's not Rakitin's doing. I didn't see Mitya<br/>yesterday. I'll see him to-day."<br/><br/>"No, it's not Rakitin; it's his brother Ivan Fyodorovitch<br/>upsetting him. It's his going to see him, that's what it is,"<br/>Grushenka began, and suddenly broke off. Alyosha gazed at her in<br/>amazement.<br/><br/>"Ivan's going? Has he been to see him? Mitya told me himself<br/>that Ivan hasn't been once."<br/>
