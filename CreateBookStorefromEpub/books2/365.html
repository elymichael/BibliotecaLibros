"It was shut. And who could open it? Bah! the door. Wait a bit!"<br/>he seemed suddenly to bethink himself, and almost with a start:<br/><br/>"Why, did you find the door open?"<br/><br/>"Yes, it was open."<br/><br/>"Why, who could have opened it if you did not open it<br/>yourselves?" cried Mitya, greatly astonished.<br/><br/>"The door stood open, and your father's murderer undoubtedly<br/>went in at that door, and, having accomplished the crime, went out<br/>again by the same door," the prosecutor pronounced deliberately, as<br/>though chiselling out each word separately. "That is perfectly<br/>clear. The murder was committed in the room and not through the<br/>window; that is absolutely certain from the examination that has<br/>been made, from the position of the body and everything. There can<br/>be no doubt of that circumstance."<br/><br/>Mitya was absolutely dumbfounded.<br/><br/>"But that's utterly impossible!" he cried, completely at a loss.<br/>"I… I didn't go in… . I tell you positively, definitely, the door<br/>was shut the whole time I was in the garden, and when I ran out of<br/>the garden. I only stood at the window and saw him through the<br/>window. That's all, that's all… . I remember to the last minute.<br/>And if I didn't remember, it would be just the same. I know it, for<br/>no one knew the signals except Smerdyakov, and me, and the dead<br/>man. And he wouldn't have opened the door to anyone in the world<br/>without the signals."<br/><br/>"Signals? What signals?" asked the prosecutor, with greedy,<br/>almost hysterical, curiosity. He instantly lost all trace of his<br/>reserve and dignity. He asked the question with a sort of cringing<br/>timidity. He scented an important fact of which he had known<br/>nothing, and was already filled with dread that Mitya might be<br/>unwilling to disclose it.<br/><br/>"So you didn't know!" Mitya winked at him with a malicious and<br/>mocking smile. "What if I won't tell you? From whom could you find<br/>out? No one knew about the signals except my father, Smerdyakov,<br/>and me: that was all. Heaven knew, too, but it won't tell you. But<br/>it's an interesting fact. There's no knowing what you might build<br/>on it. Ha ha! Take comfort, gentlemen, I'll reveal it. You've some<br/>foolish idea in your hearts. You don't know the man you have to<br/>deal with! You have to do with a prisoner who gives evidence<br/>against himself, to his own damage! Yes, for I'm a man of honour<br/>and you- are not."<br/><br/>The prosecutor swallowed this without a murmur. He was trembling<br/>with impatience to hear the new fact. Minutely and diffusely Mitya<br/>told them everything about the signals invented by Fyodor<br/>Pavlovitch for Smerdyakov. He told them exactly what every tap on<br/>the window meant, tapped the signals on the table, and when Nikolay<br/>Parfenovitch said that he supposed he, Mitya, had tapped the signal<br/>"Grushenka has come," when he tapped to his father, he answered<br/>precisely that he had tapped that signal, that "Grushenka had<br/>come."<br/><br/>"So now you can build up your tower," Mitya broke off, and again<br/>turned away from them contemptuously.<br/>
