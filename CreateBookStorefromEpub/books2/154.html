[6]<br/>sent for me<br/>and shouted at me: 'Don't dare to dream of it! If you proceed<br/>against him, I'll publish it to all the world that he beat you for<br/>your dishonesty, and then you will be prosecuted.' I call God to<br/>witness whose was the dishonesty and by whose commands I acted,<br/>wasn't it by her own and Fyodor Pavlovitch's? And what's more,' she<br/>went on, 'I'll dismiss you for good and you'll never earn another<br/>penny from me. I'll speak to my merchant too' (that's what she<br/>calls her old man) 'and he will dismiss you!' And if he dismisses<br/>me, what can I earn then from anyone? Those two are all I have to<br/>look to, for your Fyodor Pavlovitch has not only given over<br/>employing me, for another reason, but he means to make use of<br/>papers I've signed to go to law against me. And so I kept quiet,<br/>and you have seen our retreat. But now let me ask you: did Ilusha<br/>hurt your finger much? I didn't like to go into it in our mansion<br/>before him." "Yes, very much, and he was in a great fury. He was<br/>avenging you on me as a Karamazov, I see that now. But if only you<br/>had seen how he was throwing stones at his schoolfellows! It's very<br/>dangerous. They might kill him. They are children and stupid. A<br/>stone may be thrown and break somebody's head." "That's just what<br/>has happened. He has been bruised by a stone to-day. Not on the<br/>head but on the chest, just above the heart. He came home crying<br/>and groaning and now he is ill." "And you know he attacks them<br/>first. He is bitter against them on your account. They say he<br/>stabbed a boy called Krassotkin with a penknife not long ago."<br/>"I've heard about that too, it's dangerous. Krassotkin is an<br/>official here, we may hear more about it." "I would advise you,"<br/>Alyosha went on warmly, "not to send him to school at all for a<br/>time till he is calmer. and his anger is passed." "Anger!" the<br/>captain repeated, "that's just what it is. He is a little creature,<br/>but it's a mighty anger. You don't know all, sir. Let me tell you<br/>more. Since that incident all the boys have been teasing him about<br/>the 'wisp of tow.' Schoolboys are a merciless race, individually<br/>they are angels, but together, especially in schools, they are<br/>often merciless. Their teasing has stiffed up a gallant spirit in<br/>Ilusha. An ordinary boy, a weak son, would have submitted, have<br/>felt ashamed of his father, sir, but he stood up for his father<br/>against them all. For his father and for truth and justice. For<br/>what he suffered when he kissed your brother's hand and cried to<br/>him 'Forgive father, forgive him,'- that only God knows- and I, his<br/>father. For our children- not your children, but ours- the children<br/>of the poor gentlemen looked down upon by everyone- know what<br/>justice means, sir, even at nine years old. How should the rich<br/>know? They don't explore such depths once in their lives. But at<br/>that moment in the square when he kissed his hand, at that moment<br/>my Ilusha had grasped all that justice means. That truth entered<br/>into him and crushed him for ever, sir," the captain said hotly<br/>again with a sort of frenzy, and he struck his right fist against<br/>his left palm as though he wanted to show how "the truth" crushed<br/>Ilusha. "That very day, sir, he fell ill with fever and was<br/>delirious all night. All that day he hardly said a word to me, but<br/>I noticed he kept watching me from the corner, though he turned to<br/>the window and pretended to be learning his lessons. But I could<br/>see his mind was not on his lessons. Next day I got drunk to forget<br/>my troubles, sinful man as I am, and I don't remember much. Mamma<br/>began crying, too- I am very fond of mamma- well, I spent my last<br/>penny drowning my troubles. Don't despise me for that, sir, in<br/>Russia men who drink are the best. The best men amongst us are the<br/>greatest drunkards. I lay down and I don't remember about Ilusha,<br/>though all that day the boys had been jeering at him at school.<br/>'Wisp of tow,' they shouted, 'your father was pulled out of the<br/>tavern by his wisp of tow, you ran by and begged forgiveness.' "On<br/>the third day when he came back from school, I saw he looked pale<br/>and wretched. 'What is it?' I asked. He wouldn't answer. Well,<br/>there's no talking in our mansion without mamma and the girls<br/>taking part in it. What's more, the girls had heard about it the<br/>very first day. Varvara had begun snarling. 'You fools and<br/>buffoons, can you ever do anything rational?' 'Quite so,' I<br/>said,'can we ever do anything rational?' For the time I turned it<br/>off like that. So in the evening I took the boy out for a walk, for<br/>you must know we go for a walk every evening, always the same way,<br/>along which we are going now- from our gate to that great stone<br/>which lies alone in the road under the hurdle, which marks the<br/>beginning of the town pasture. A beautiful and lonely spot, sir.<br/>Ilusha and I walked along hand in hand as usual. He has a little<br/>hand, his fingers are thin and cold- he suffers with his chest, you<br/>know. 'Father,' said he, 'father!' 'Well?' said I. I saw his eyes<br/>flashing. 'Father, how he treated you then!' 'It can't be helped,<br/>Ilusha,' I said. 'Don't forgive him, father, don't forgive him! At<br/>school they say that he has paid you ten roubles for it.' 'No<br/>Ilusha,' said I, 'I would not take money from him for anything.' he<br/>began trembling all over, took my hand in both his and kissed it<br/>again. 'Father,' he said, 'father, challenge him to a duel, at<br/>school they say you are a coward and won't challenge him, and that<br/>you'll accept ten roubles from him.' 'I can't challenge him to a<br/>duel, Ilusha,' I answered. And I told briefly what I've just told<br/>you. He listened. 'Father,' he said, anyway don't forgive it. When<br/>I grow up I'll call him out myself and kill him.' His eyes shone<br/>and glowed. And of course I am his father, and I had to put in a<br/>word: 'It's a sin to kill,' I said, 'even in a duel.' 'Father,' he<br/>said, 'when I grow up, I'll knock him down, knock the sword out of<br/>his hand, I'll fall on him, wave my sword over him and say: "I<br/>could kill you, but I forgive you, so there!"' You see what the<br/>workings of his little mind have been during these two days; he<br/>must have been planning that vengeance all day, and raving about it<br/>at night. "But he began to come home from school badly beaten, I<br/>found out about it the day before yesterday, and you are right, I<br/>won't send him to that school any more. I heard that he was<br/>standing up against all the class alone and defying them all, that<br/>his heart was full of resentment, of bitterness- I was alarmed<br/>about him. We went for another walk. 'Father,' he asked, 'are the<br/>rich people stronger than anyone else on earth?' 'Yes, Ilusha,' I<br/>said, 'there are no people on earth stronger than the rich.'<br/>'Father,' he said, 'I will get rich, I will become an officer and<br/>conquer everybody. The Tsar will reward me, I will come back here<br/>and then no one will dare- ' Then he was silent and his lips still<br/>kept trembling. 'Father,' he said, 'what a horrid town this is.'<br/>'Yes, Ilusha,' I said, 'it isn't a very nice town.' 'Father, let us<br/>move into another town, a nice one,' he said, 'where people don't<br/>know about us.' 'We will move, we will, Ilusha,' said I, 'only I<br/>must save up for it.' I was glad to be able to turn his mind from<br/>painful thoughts, and we began to dream of how we would move to<br/>another town, how we would buy a horse and cart. 'We will put mamma<br/>and your sisters inside, we will cover them up and we'll walk, you<br/>shall have a lift now and then, and I'll walk beside, for we must<br/>take care of our horse, we can't all ride. That's how we'll go.' He<br/>was enchanted at that, most of all at the thought of having a horse<br/>and driving him. For of course a Russian boy is born among horses.<br/>We chattered a long while. Thank God, I thought, I have diverted<br/>his mind and comforted him. "That was the day before yesterday, in<br/>the evening, but last night everything was changed. He had gone to<br/>school in the morning, he came back depressed, terribly depressed.<br/>In the evening I took him by the hand and we went for a walk; he<br/>would not talk. There was a wind blowing and no sun, and a feeling<br/>of autumn; twilight was coming on. We walked along, both of us<br/>depressed. 'Well, my boy,' said I, 'how about our setting off on<br/>our travels?' I thought I might bring him back to our talk of the<br/>day before. He didn't answer, but I felt his fingers trembling in<br/>my hand. Ah, I thought, it's a bad job; there's something fresh. We<br/>had reached the stone where we are now. I sat down on the stone.<br/>And in the air there were lots of kites flapping and whirling.<br/>There were as many as thirty in sight. Of course, it's just the<br/>season for the kites. 'Look, Ilusha,' said I, 'it's time we got out<br/>our last year's kite again. I'll mend it; where have you put it<br/>away?' My boy made no answer. He looked away and turned sideways to<br/>me. And then a gust of wind blew up the sand. He suddenly fell on<br/>me, threw both his little arms round my neck and held me tight. You<br/>know, when children are silent and proud, and try to keep back<br/>their tears when they are in great trouble and suddenly break down,<br/>their tears fall in streams. With those warm streams of tears, he<br/>suddenly wetted my face. He sobbed and shook as though he were in<br/>convulsions, and squeezed up against me as I sat on the stone.<br/>'Father,' he kept crying, 'dear father, how he insulted you!' And I<br/>sobbed too. We sat shaking in each other's arms. 'Ilusha,' I said<br/>to him, 'Ilusha, darling.' No one saw us then. God alone saw us; I<br/>hope He will record it to my credit. You must thank your brother,<br/>Alexey Fyodorovitch. No, sir, I won't thrash my boy for your<br/>satisfaction." He had gone back to his original tone of resentful<br/>buffoonery. Alyosha felt, though, that he trusted him, and that if<br/>there had been someone else in his, Alyosha's place, the man would<br/>not have spoken so openly and would not have told what he had just<br/>told. This encouraged Alyosha, whose heart was trembling on the<br/>verge of tears. "Ah, how I would like to make friends with your<br/>boy!" he cried. "If you could arrange it- " "Certainly, sir,"<br/>muttered the captain. "But now listen to something quite<br/>different!" Alyosha went on. "I have a message for you. That same<br/>brother of mine, Dmitri, has insulted his betrothed, too, a<br/>noble-hearted girl of whom you have probably heard. I have a right<br/>to tell you of her wrong; I ought to do so, in fact, for, hearing<br/>of the insult done to you and learning all about your unfortunate<br/>position, she commissioned me at once- just now- to bring you this<br/>help from her- but only from her alone, not from Dmitri, who has<br/>abandoned her. Nor from me, his brother, nor from anyone else, but<br/>from her, only from her! She entreats you to accept her help… .You<br/>have both been insulted by the same man. She thought of you only<br/>when she had just received a similar insult from him- similar in<br/>its cruelty, I mean. She comes like a sister to help a brother in<br/>misfortune… . She told me to persuade you to take these two hundred<br/>roubles from her, as from a sister, knowing that you are in such<br/>need. No one will know of it, it can give rise to no unjust<br/>slander. There are the two hundred roubles, and I swear you must<br/>take them unless- unless all men are to be enemies on earth! But<br/>there are brothers even on earth… . You have a generous heart… you<br/>must see that, you must," and Alyosha held out two new<br/>rainbow-coloured hundred-rouble notes. They were both standing at<br/>the time by the great stone close to the fence, and there was no<br/>one near. The notes seemed to produce a tremendous impression on<br/>the captain. He started, but at first only from astonishment. Such<br/>an outcome of their conversation was the last thing he expected.<br/>Nothing could have been farther from his dreams than help from<br/>anyone- and such a sum! He took the notes, and for a minute he was<br/>almost unable to answer, quite a new expression came into his face.<br/>"That for me? So much money- two hundred roubles! Good heavens!<br/>Why, I haven't seen so much money for the last four years! Mercy on<br/>us! And she says she is a sister… . And is that the truth?" "I<br/>swear that all I told you is the truth,"cried Alyosha. The captain<br/>flushed red. "Listen, my dear, listen. If I take it, I shan't be<br/>behaving like a scoundrel? In your eyes, Alexey Fyodorovitch, I<br/>shan't be a scoundrel? No, Alexey Fyodorovitch, listen, listen," he<br/>hurried, touching Alyosha with both his hands. "You are persuading<br/>me to take it, saying that it's a sister sends it, but inwardly, in<br/>your heart won't you feel contempt for me if I take it, eh?" "No,<br/>no, on my salvation I swear I shan't! And no one will ever know but<br/>me- I, you and she, and one other lady, her great friend." "Never<br/>mind the lady! Listen, Alexey Fyodorovitch, at a moment like this<br/>you must listen, for you can't understand what these two hundred<br/>roubles mean to me now." The poor fellow went on rising gradually<br/>into a sort of incoherent, almost wild enthusiasm. He was thrown<br/>off his balance and talked extremely fast, as though afraid he<br/>would not be allowed to say all he had to say. "Besides its being<br/>honestly acquired from a 'sister,' so highly respected and revered,<br/>do you know that now I can look after mamma and Nina, my hunchback<br/>angel daughter? Doctor Herzenstube came to me in the kindness of<br/>his heart and was examining them both for a whole hour. 'I can make<br/>nothing of it,' said he, but he prescribed a mineral water which is<br/>kept at a chemist's here. He said it would be sure to do her good,<br/>and he ordered baths, too, with some medicine in them. The mineral<br/>water costs thirty copecks, and she'd need to drink forty bottles<br/>perhaps: so I took the prescription and laid it on the shelf under<br/>the ikons, and there it lies. And he ordered hot baths for Nina<br/>with something dissolved in them, morning and evening. But how can<br/>we carry out such a cure in our mansion, without servants, without<br/>help, without a bath, and without water? Nina is rheumatic all<br/>over, I don't think I told you that. All her right side aches at<br/>night, she is in agony, and, would you believe it, the angel bears<br/>it without groaning for fear of waking us. We eat what we can get,<br/>and she'll only take the leavings, what you'd scarcely give to a<br/>dog. 'I am not worth it, I am taking it from you, I am a burden on<br/>you,' that's what her angel eyes try to express. We wait on her,<br/>but she doesn't like it. 'I am a useless cripple, no good to<br/>anyone.' As though she were not worth it, when she is the saving of<br/>all of us with her angelic sweetness. Without her, without her<br/>gentle word it would be hell among us! She softens even Varvara.<br/>And don't judge Varvara harshly either, she is an angel too, she,<br/>too, has suffered wrong. She came to us for the summer, and she<br/>brought sixteen roubles she had earned by lessons and saved up, to<br/>go back with to Petersburg in September, that is now. But we took<br/>her money and lived on it, so now she has nothing to go back with.<br/>Though indeed she couldn't go back, for she has to work for us like<br/>a slave. She is like an overdriven horse with all of us on her<br/>back. She waits on us all, mends and washes, sweeps the floor, puts<br/>mamma to bed. And mamma is capricious and tearful and insane! And<br/>now I can get a servant with this money, you understand, Alexey<br/>Fyodorovitch, I can get medicines for the dear creatures, I can<br/>send my student to Petersburg, I can buy beef, I can feed them<br/>properly. Good Lord, but it's a dream!" Alyosha was delighted that<br/>he had brought him such happiness and that the poor fellow had<br/>consented to be made happy. "Stay, Alexey Fyodorovitch, stay," the<br/>captain began to talk with frenzied rapidity, carried away by a new<br/>day-dream. "Do you know that Ilusha and I will perhaps really carry<br/>out our dream. We will buy a horse and cart, a black horse, he<br/>insists on its being black, and we will set off as we pretended the<br/>other day. I have an old friend, a lawyer in K. province, and I<br/>heard through a trustworthy man that if I were to go he'd give me a<br/>place as clerk in his office, so, who knows, maybe he would. So I'd<br/>just put mamma and Nina in the cart, and Ilusha could drive, and<br/>I'd walk, I'd walk… . Why, if I only succeed in getting one debt<br/>paid that's owing me, I should have perhaps enough for that too!"<br/>"There would be enough!" cried Alyosha. "Katerina Ivanovna will<br/>send you as much more as you need, and you know, I have money too,<br/>take what you want, as you would from a brother, from a friend, you<br/>can give it back later… . (You'll get rich. you'll get rich!) And<br/>you know you couldn't have a better idea than to move to another<br/>province! It would be the saving of you, especially of your boy and<br/>you ought to go quickly, before the winter, before the cold. You<br/>must write to us when you are there, and we will always be<br/>brothers… No, it's not a dream!" Alyosha could have hugged him, he<br/>was so pleased. But glancing at him he stopped short. The man was<br/>standing with his neck outstretched and his lips protruding, with a<br/>pale and frenzied face. His lips were moving as though trying to<br/>articulate something; no sound came, but still his lips moved. It<br/>was uncanny. "What is it?" asked Alyosha, startled. "Alexey<br/>Fyodorovitch… I… you," muttered the captain, faltering, looking at<br/>him with a strange, wild, fixed stare, and an air of desperate<br/>resolution. At the same time there was a sort of grin on his lips.<br/>"I… you, sir… wouldn't you like me to show you a little trick I<br/>know?" he murmured, suddenly, in a firm rapid whisper, his voice no<br/>longer faltering. "What trick?" "A pretty trick," whispered the<br/>captain. His mouth was twisted on the left side, his left eye was<br/>screwed up. He still stared at Alyosha. "What is the matter? What<br/>trick?" Alyosha cried, now thoroughly alarmed. "Why, look,"<br/>squealed the captain suddenly, and showing him the two notes which<br/>he had been holding by one corner between his thumb and forefinger<br/>during the conversation, he crumpled them up savagely and squeezed<br/>them tight in his right hand. "Do you see, do you see?" he<br/>shrieked, pale and infuriated. And suddenly flinging up his hand,<br/>he threw the crumpled notes on the sand. "Do you see?" he shrieked<br/>again, pointing to them. "Look there!" And with wild fury he began<br/>trampling them under his heel, gasping and exclaiming as he did so:<br/>"So much for your money! So much for your money! So much for your<br/>money! So much for your money!" Suddenly he darted back and drew<br/>himself up before Alyosha, and his whole figure expressed<br/>unutterable pride. "Tell those who sent you that the wisp of tow<br/>does not sell his honour," he cried, raising his arm in the air.<br/>Then he turned quickly and began to run; but he had not run five<br/>steps before he turned completely round and kissed his hand to<br/>Alyosha. He ran another five paces and then turned round for the<br/>last time. This time his face was not contorted with laughter, but<br/>quivering all over with tears. In a tearful, faltering, sobbing<br/>voice he cried: "What should I say to my boy if I took money from<br/>you for our shame?" And then he ran on without turning. Alyosha<br/>looked after him, inexpressibly grieved. Oh, he saw that till the<br/>very last moment the man had not known he would crumple up and<br/>fling away the notes. He did not turn back. Alyosha knew he would<br/>not. He would not follow him and call him back, he knew why. When<br/>he was out of sight, Alyosha picked up the two notes. They were<br/>very much crushed and crumpled, and had been pressed into the sand,<br/>but were uninjured and even rustled like new ones when Alyosha<br/>unfolded them and smoothed them out. After smoothing them out, he<br/>folded them up, put them in his pocket and went to Katerina<br/>Ivanovna to report on the success of her commission.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
