"The 'something else' I meant was that you probably, too, were
very desirous of your parent's death."

Ivan jumped up and struck him with all his might on the
shoulder, so that he fell back against the wall. In an instant his
face was bathed in tears. Saying, "It's a shame, sir, to strike a
sick man," he dried his eyes with a very dirty blue check
handkerchief and sank into quiet weeping. A minute passed.

"That's enough! Leave off," Ivan said peremptorily, sitting down
again. "Don't put me out of all patience."

Smerdyakov took the rag from his eyes. Every line of his
puckered face reflected the insult he had just received.

"So you thought then, you scoundrel, that together with Dmitri I
meant to kill my father?"

"I didn't know what thoughts were in your mind then," said
Smerdyakov resentfully; "and so I stopped you then at the gate to
sound you on that very point."

"To sound what, what?"

"Why, that very circumstance, whether you wanted your father to
be murdered or not."

What infuriated Ivan more than anything was the aggressive,
insolent tone to which Smerdyakov persistently adhered.

"It was you murdered him?" he cried suddenly.

Smerdyakov smiled contemptuously.
