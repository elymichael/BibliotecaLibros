"I… I'm not crying… . Well, good evening!" He instantly turned<br/>round in his chair, and suddenly laughed, not his abrupt wooden<br/>laugh, but a long, quivering, inaudible nervous laugh.<br/><br/>"Well, there you are again… . Come, cheer up, cheer up!"<br/>Grushenka said to him persuasively. "I'm very glad you've come,<br/>very glad, Mitya, do you hear, I'm very glad! I want him to stay<br/>here with us," she said peremptorily, addressing the whole company,<br/>though her words were obviously meant for the man sitting on the<br/>sofa. "I wish it, I wish it! And if he goes away I shall go, too!"<br/>she added with flashing eyes.<br/><br/>"What my queen commands is law!" pronounced the Pole, gallantly<br/>kissing Grushenka's hand. "I beg you, panie, to join our company,"<br/>he added politely, addressing Mitya.<br/><br/>Mitya was jumping up with the obvious intention of delivering<br/>another tirade, but the words did not come.<br/><br/>"Let's drink, Panie," he blurted out instead of making a speech.<br/>Everyone laughed.<br/><br/>"Good heavens! I thought he was going to begin again!" Grushenka<br/>exclaimed nervously. "Do you hear, Mitya," she went on insistently,<br/>"don't prance about, but it's nice you've brought the champagne. I<br/>want some myself, and I can't bear liqueurs. And best of all,<br/>you've come yourself. We were fearfully dull here… . You've come<br/>for a spree again, I suppose? But put your money in your pocket.<br/>Where did you get such a lot?"<br/><br/>Mitya had been, all this time, holding in his hand the crumpled<br/>bundle of notes on which the eyes of all, especially of the Poles,<br/>were fixed. In confusion he thrust them hurriedly into his pocket.<br/>He flushed. At that moment the innkeeper brought in an uncorked<br/>bottle of champagne, and glasses on a tray. Mitya snatched up the<br/>bottle, but he was so bewildered that he did not know what to do<br/>with it. Kalgonov took it from him and poured out the<br/>champagne.<br/><br/>"Another! Another bottle!" Mitya cried to the inn-keeper, and,<br/>forgetting to clink glasses with the Pole whom he had so solemnly<br/>invited to drink to their good understanding, he drank off his<br/>glass without waiting for anyone else. His whole countenance<br/>suddenly changed. The solemn and tragic expression with which he<br/>had entered vanished completely, and a look of something childlike<br/>came into his face. He seemed to have become suddenly gentle and<br/>subdued. He looked shyly and happily at everyone, with a continual<br/>nervous little laugh, and the blissful expression of a dog who has<br/>done wrong, been punished, and forgiven. He seemed to have<br/>forgotten everything, and was looking round at everyone with a<br/>childlike smile of delight. He looked at Grushenka, laughing<br/>continually, and bringing his chair close up to her. By degrees he<br/>had gained some idea of the two Poles, though he had formed no<br/>definite conception of them yet.<br/><br/>The Pole on the sofa struck him by his dignified demeanour and<br/>his Polish accent; and, above all, by his pipe. "Well, what of it?<br/>It's a good thing he's smoking a pipe," he reflected. The Pole's<br/>puffy, middle-aged face, with its tiny nose and two very thin,<br/>pointed, dyed and impudent-looking moustaches, had not so far<br/>roused the faintest doubts in Mitya. He was not even particularly<br/>struck by the Pole's absurd wig made in Siberia, with love-locks<br/>foolishly combed forward over the temples. "I suppose it's all<br/>right since he wears a wig," he went on, musing blissfully. The<br/>other, younger Pole, who was staring insolently and defiantly at<br/>the company and listening to the conversation with silent contempt,<br/>still only impressed Mitya by his great height, which was in<br/>striking contrast to the Pole on the sofa. "If he stood up he'd be<br/>six foot three." The thought flitted through Mitya's mind. It<br/>occurred to him, too, that this Pole must be the friend of the<br/>other, as it were, a "bodyguard," and no doubt the big Pole was at<br/>the disposal of the little Pole with the pipe. But this all seemed<br/>to Mitya perfectly right and not to be questioned. In his mood of<br/>doglike submissiveness all feeling of rivalry had died away.<br/><br/>Grushenka's mood and the enigmatic tone of some of her words he<br/>completely failed to grasp. All he understood, with thrilling<br/>heart, was that she was kind to him, that she had forgiven him, and<br/>made him sit by her. He was beside himself with delight, watching<br/>her sip her glass of champagne. The silence of the company seemed<br/>somehow to strike him, however, and he looked round at everyone<br/>with expectant eyes.<br/><br/>"Why are we sitting here though, gentlemen? Why don't you begin<br/>doing something?" his smiling eyes seemed to ask.<br/>
