<br/>It was the end of June, and our meeting was to take place at<br/>seven o'clock the next day on the outskirts of the town- and then<br/>something happened that in very truth was the turning point of my<br/>life. In the evening, returning home in a savage and brutal humour,<br/>I flew into a rage with my orderly Afanasy, and gave him two blows<br/>in the face with all my might, so that it was covered with blood.<br/>He had not long been in my service and I had struck him before, but<br/>never with such ferocious cruelty. And, believe me, though it's<br/>forty years ago, I recall it now with shame and pain. I went to bed<br/>and slept for about three hours; when I waked up the day was<br/>breaking. I got up- I did not want to sleep any more- I went to the<br/>window- opened it, it looked out upon the garden; I saw the sun<br/>rising; it was warm and beautiful, the birds were singing.<br/><br/>"What's the meaning of it?" I thought. "I feel in my heart as it<br/>were something vile and shameful. Is it because I am going to shed<br/>blood? No," I thought, "I feel it's not that. Can it be that I am<br/>afraid of death, afraid of being killed? No, that's not it, that's<br/>not it at all."… And all at once I knew what it was: it was because<br/>I had beaten Afanasy the evening before! It all rose before my<br/>mind, it all was, as it were, repeated over again; he stood before<br/>me and I was beating him straight on the face and he was holding<br/>his arms stiffly down, his head erect, his eyes fixed upon me as<br/>though on parade. He staggered at every blow and did not even dare<br/>to raise his hands to protect himself. That is what a man has been<br/>brought to, and that was a man beating a fellow creature! What a<br/>crime! It was as though a sharp dagger had pierced me right<br/>through. I stood as if I were struck dumb, while the sun was<br/>shining, the leaves were rejoicing and the birds were trilling the<br/>praise of God… . I hid my face in my hands, fell on my bed and<br/>broke into a storm of tears. And then I remembered by brother<br/>Markel and what he said on his death-bed to his servants: "My dear<br/>ones, why do you wait on me, why do you love me, am I worth your<br/>waiting on me?"<br/><br/>"Yes, am I worth it?" flashed through my mind. "After all what<br/>am I worth, that another man, a fellow creature, made in the<br/>likeness and image of God, should serve me?" For the first time in<br/>my life this question forced itself upon me. He had said, "Mother,<br/>my little heart, in truth we are each responsible to all for all,<br/>it's only that men don't know this. If they knew it, the world<br/>would be a paradise at once."<br/><br/>"God, can that too be false?" I thought as I wept. "In truth,<br/>perhaps, I am more than all others responsible for all, a greater<br/>sinner than all men in the world." And all at once the whole truth<br/>in its full light appeared to me: what was I going to do? I was<br/>going to kill a good, clever, noble man, who had done me no wrong,<br/>and by depriving his wife of happiness for the rest of her life, I<br/>should be torturing and killing her too. I lay thus in my bed with<br/>my face in the pillow, heedless how the time was passing. Suddenly<br/>my second, the ensign, came in with the pistols to fetch me.<br/><br/>"Ah," said he, "it's a good thing you are up already, it's time<br/>we were off, come along!"<br/><br/>I did not know what to do and hurried to and fro undecided; we<br/>went out to the carriage, however.<br/><br/>"Wait here a minute," I said to him. "I'll be back directly, I<br/>have forgotten my purse."<br/><br/>And I ran back alone, to Afanasy's little room.<br/><br/>"Afanasy," I said, "I gave you two blows on the face yesterday,<br/>forgive me," I said.<br/><br/>He started as though he were frightened, and looked at me; and I<br/>saw that it was not enough, and on the spot, in my full officer's<br/>uniform, I dropped at his feet and bowed my head to the ground.<br/><br/>
