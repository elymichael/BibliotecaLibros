"I am in a difficulty, kids," Krassotkin began solemnly, "and<br/>you must help me. Agafya must have broken her leg, since she has<br/>not turned up till now, that's certain. I must go out. Will you let<br/>me go?"<br/><br/>The children looked anxiously at one another. Their smiling<br/>faces showed signs of uneasiness, but they did not yet fully grasp<br/>what was expected of them.<br/><br/>"You won't be naughty while I am gone? You won't climb on the<br/>cupboard and break your legs? You won't be frightened alone and<br/>cry?"<br/><br/>A look of profound despondency came into the children's<br/>faces.<br/><br/>"And I could show you something as a reward, a little copper<br/>cannon which can be fired with real gunpowder."<br/><br/>The children's faces instantly brightened. "Show us the cannon,"<br/>said Kostya, beaming all over.<br/><br/>Krassotkin put his hand in his satchel, and pulling out a little<br/>bronze cannon stood it on the table.<br/><br/>"Ah, you are bound to ask that! Look, it's on wheels." He rolled<br/>the toy on along the table. "And it can be fired off, too. It can<br/>be loaded with shot and fired off."<br/><br/>"And it could kill anyone?"<br/><br/>"It can kill anyone; you've only got to aim at anybody," and<br/>Krassotkin explained where the powder had to be put, where the shot<br/>should be rolled in, showing a tiny hole like a touch-hole, and<br/>told them that it kicked when it was fired.<br/><br/>The children listened with intense interest. What particularly<br/>struck their imagination was that the cannon kicked.<br/>
