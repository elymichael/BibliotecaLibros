"No, I have no other proof."<br/><br/>The prosecutor dropped the examination at this point. The<br/>impression left by Alyosha's evidence on the public was most<br/>disappointing. There had been talk about Smerdyakov before the<br/>trial; someone had heard something, someone had pointed out<br/>something else, it was said that Alyosha had gathered together some<br/>extraordinary proofs of his brother's innocence and Smerdyakov's<br/>guilt, and after all there was nothing, no evidence except certain<br/>moral convictions so natural in a brother.<br/><br/>But Fetyukovitch began his cross-examination. On his asking<br/>Alyosha when it was that the prisoner had told him of his hatred<br/>for his father and that he might kill him, and whether he had heard<br/>it, for instance, at their last meeting before the catastrophe,<br/>Alyosha started as he answered, as though only just recollecting<br/>and understanding something.<br/><br/>"I remember one circumstance now which I'd quite forgotten<br/>myself. It wasn't clear to me at the time, but now-"<br/><br/>And, obviously only now for the first time struck by an idea, he<br/>recounted eagerly how, at his last interview with Mitya that<br/>evening under the tree, on the road to the monastery, Mitya had<br/>struck himself on the breast, "the upper part of the breast," and<br/>had repeated several times that he had a means of regaining his<br/>honour, that that means was here, here on his breast. "I thought,<br/>when he struck himself on the breast, he meant that it was in his<br/>heart," Alyosha continued, "that he might find in his heart<br/>strength to save himself from some awful disgrace which was<br/>awaiting him and which he did not dare confess even to me. I must<br/>confess I did think at the time that he was speaking of our father,<br/>and that the disgrace he was shuddering at was the thought of going<br/>to our father and doing some violence to him. Yet it was just then<br/>that he pointed to something on his breast, so that I remember the<br/>idea struck me at the time that the heart is not on that part of<br/>the breast, but below, and that he struck himself much too high,<br/>just below the neck, and kept pointing to that place. My idea<br/>seemed silly to me at the time, but he was perhaps pointing then to<br/>that little bag in which he had fifteen hundred roubles!"<br/><br/>"Just so, Mitya cried from his place. "That's right, Alyosha, it<br/>was the little bag I struck with my fist."<br/><br/>Fetyukovitch flew to him in hot haste entreating him to keep<br/>quiet, and at the same instant pounced on Alyosha. Alyosha, carried<br/>away himself by his recollection, warmly expressed his theory that<br/>this disgrace was probably just that fifteen hundred roubles on<br/>him, which he might have returned to Katerina Ivanovna as half of<br/>what he owed her, but which he had yet determined not to repay her<br/>and to use for another purpose- namely, to enable him to elope with<br/>Grushenka, if she consented.<br/><br/>"It is so, it must be so," exclaimed Alyosha, in sudden<br/>excitement. "My brother cried several times that half of the<br/>disgrace, half of it (he said half several times) he could free<br/>himself from at once, but that he was so unhappy in his weakness of<br/>will that he wouldn't do it… that he knew beforehand he was<br/>incapable of doing it!"<br/><br/>"And you clearly, confidently remember that he struck himself<br/>just on this part of the breast?" Fetyukovitch asked eagerly.<br/><br/>"Clearly and confidently, for I thought at the time, 'Why does<br/>he strike himself up there when the heart is lower down?' and the<br/>thought seemed stupid to me at the time… I remember its seeming<br/>stupid… it flashed through my mind. That's what brought it back to<br/>me just now. How could I have forgotten it till now? It was that<br/>little bag he meant when he said he had the means but wouldn't give<br/>back that fifteen hundred. And when he was arrested at Mokroe he<br/>cried out- I know, I was told it- that he considered it the most<br/>disgraceful act of his life that when he had the means of repaying<br/>Katerina Ivanovna half (half, note!) what he owed her, he yet could<br/>not bring himself to repay the money and preferred to remain a<br/>thief in her eyes rather than part with it. And what torture, what<br/>torture that debt has been to him!" Alyosha exclaimed in<br/>conclusion.<br/><br/>The prosecutor, of course, intervened. He asked Alyosha to<br/>describe once more how it had all happened, and several times<br/>insisted on the question, "Had the prisoner seemed to point to<br/>anything? Perhaps he had simply struck himself with his fist on the<br/>breast?"<br/>
