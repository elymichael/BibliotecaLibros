<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>1<br/>The Beginning of Perhotin's Official Career<br/><br/><br/>PYOTR ILYITCH PERHOTIN, whom we left knocking at the strong<br/>locked gates of the widow Morozov's house, ended, of course, by<br/>making himself heard. Fenya, who was still excited by the fright<br/>she had had two hours before, and too much "upset" to go to bed,<br/>was almost frightened into hysterics on hearing the furious<br/>knocking at the gate. Though she had herself seen him drive away,<br/>she fancied that it must be Dmitri Fyodorovitch knocking again, no<br/>one else could knock so savagely. She ran to the house-porter, who<br/>had already waked up and gone out to the gate, and began imploring<br/>him not to open it. But having questioned Pyotr Ilyitch, and<br/>learned that he wanted to see Fenya on very "important business,"<br/>the man made up his mind at last to open. Pyotr Ilyitch was<br/>admitted into Fenya's kitchen, but the girl begged him to allow the<br/>houseporter to be present, "because of her misgivings." He began<br/>questioning her and at once learnt the most vital fact, that is,<br/>that when Dmitri Fyodorovitch had run out to look for Grushenka, he<br/>had snatched up a pestle from the mortar, and that when he<br/>returned, the pestle was not with him and his hands were smeared<br/>with blood.<br/><br/>"And the blood was simply flowing, dripping from him, dripping!"<br/>Fenya kept exclaiming. This horrible detail was simply the product<br/>of her disordered imagination. But although not "dripping," Pyotr<br/>Ilyitch had himself seen those hands stained with blood, and had<br/>helped to wash them. Moreover, the question he had to decide was,<br/>not how soon the blood had dried, but where Dmitri Fyodorovitch had<br/>run with the pestle, or rather, whether it really was to Fyodor<br/>Pavlovitch's, and how he could satisfactorily ascertain. Pyotr<br/>Ilyitch persisted in returning to this point, and though he found<br/>out nothing conclusive, yet he carried away a conviction that<br/>Dmitri Fyodorovitch could have gone nowhere but to his father's<br/>house, and that, therefore, something must have happened there.<br/><br/>"And when he came back," Fenya added with excitement. "I told<br/>him the whole story, and then I began asking him, 'Why have you got<br/>blood on your hands, Dmitri Fyodorovitch?' and he answered that<br/>that was human blood, and that he had just killed someone. He<br/>confessed it all to me, and suddenly ran off like a madman. I sat<br/>down and began thinking, where's he run off to now like a madman?<br/>He'll go to Mokroe, I thought, and kill my mistress there. I ran<br/>out to beg him not to kill her. I was running to his lodgings, but<br/>I looked at Plotnikov's shop, and saw him just setting off, and<br/>there was no blood on his hands then." (Fenya had noticed this and<br/>remembered it.) Fenya's old grandmother confirmed her evidence as<br/>far as she was capable. After asking some further questions, Pyotr<br/>Ilyitch left the house, even more upset and uneasy than he had been<br/>when he entered it.<br/><br/>The most direct and the easiest thing for him to do would have<br/>been to go straight to Fyodor Pavlovitch's, to find out whether<br/>anything had happened there, and if so, what; and only to go to the<br/>police captain, as Pyotr Ilyitch firmly intended doing, when he had<br/>satisfied himself of the fact. But the night was dark, Fyodor<br/>Pavlovitch's gates were strong, and he would have to knock again.<br/>His acquaintance with Fyodor Pavlovitch was of the slightest, and<br/>what if, after he had been knocking, they opened to him, and<br/>nothing had happened? Fyodor Pavlovitch in his jeering way would go<br/>telling the story all over the town, how a stranger, called<br/>Perhotin, had broken in upon him at midnight to ask if anyone had<br/>killed him. It would make a scandal. And scandal was what Pyotr<br/>Ilyitch dreaded more than anything in the world.<br/><br/>Yet the feeling that possessed him was so strong, that though he<br/>stamped his foot angrily and swore at himself, he set off again,<br/>not to Fyodor Pavlovitch's but to Madame Hohlakov's. He decided<br/>that if she denied having just given Dmitri Fyodorovitch three<br/>thousand roubles, he would go straight to the police captain, but<br/>if she admitted having given him the money, he would go home and<br/>let the matter rest till next morning.<br/><br/>It is, of course, perfectly evident that there was even more<br/>likelihood of causing scandal by going at eleven o'clock at night<br/>to a fashionable lady, a complete stranger, and perhaps rousing her<br/>from her bed to ask her an amazing question, than by going to<br/>Fyodor Pavlovitch. But that is just how it is, sometimes,<br/>especially in cases like the present one, with the decisions of the<br/>most precise and phlegmatic people. Pyotr Ilyitch was by no means<br/>phlegmatic at that moment. He remembered all his life how a<br/>haunting uneasiness gradually gained possession of him, growing<br/>more and more painful and driving him on, against his will. Yet he<br/>kept cursing himself, of course, all the way for going to this<br/>lady, but "I will get to the bottom of it, I will!" he repeated for<br/>the tenth time, grinding his teeth, and he carried out his<br/>intention.<br/><br/>It was exactly eleven o'clock when he entered Madame Hohlakov's<br/>house. He was admitted into the yard pretty quickly, but, in<br/>response to his inquiry whether the lady was still up, the porter<br/>could give no answer, except that she was usually in bed by that<br/>time.<br/>
