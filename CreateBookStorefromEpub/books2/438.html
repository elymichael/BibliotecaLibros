<br/>All this time Doctor Herzenstube, who was called in by Katerina<br/>Ivanovna, came punctually every other day, but little was gained by<br/>his visits and he dosed the invalid mercilessly. But on that Sunday<br/>morning a new doctor was expected, who had come from Moscow, where<br/>he had a great reputation. Katerina Ivanovna had sent for him from<br/>Moscow at great expense, not expressly for Ilusha, but for another<br/>object of which more will be said in its place hereafter. But, as<br/>he had come, she had asked him to see Ilusha as well, and the<br/>captain had been told to expect him. He hadn't the slightest idea<br/>that Kolya Krassotkin was coming, though he had long wished for a<br/>visit from the boy for whom Ilusha was fretting.<br/><br/>At the moment when Krassotkin opened the door and came into the<br/>room, the captain and all the boys were round Ilusha's bed, looking<br/>at a tiny mastiff pup, which had only been born the day before,<br/>though the captain had bespoken it a week ago to comfort and amuse<br/>Ilusha, who was still fretting over the lost and probably dead<br/>Zhutchka. Ilusha, who had heard three days before that he was to be<br/>presented with a puppy, not an ordinary puppy, but a pedigree<br/>mastiff (a very important point, of course), tried from delicacy of<br/>feeling to pretend that he was pleased. But his father and the boys<br/>could not help seeing that the puppy only served to recall to his<br/>little heart the thought of the unhappy dog he had killed. The<br/>puppy lay beside him feebly moving and he, smiling sadly, stroked<br/>it with his thin, pale, wasted hand. Clearly he liked the puppy,<br/>but… it wasn't Zhutchka; if he could have had Zhutchka and the<br/>puppy, too, then he would have been completely happy.<br/><br/>"Krassotkin!" cried one of the boys suddenly. He was the first<br/>to see him come in.<br/><br/>Krassotkin's entrance made a general sensation; the boys moved<br/>away and stood on each side of the bed, so that he could get a full<br/>view of Ilusha. The captain ran eagerly to meet Kolya.<br/><br/>"Please come in… you are welcome!" he said hurriedly. "Ilusha,<br/>Mr. Krassotkin has come to see you!<br/><br/>But Krassotkin, shaking hands with him hurriedly, instantly<br/>showed his complete knowledge of the manners of good society. He<br/>turned first to the captain's wife sitting in her armchair, who was<br/>very ill-humoured at the moment, and was grumbling that the boys<br/>stood between her and Ilusha's bed and did not let her see the new<br/>puppy. With the greatest courtesy he made her a bow, scraping his<br/>foot, and turning to Nina, he made her, as the only other lady<br/>present, a similar bow. This polite behaviour made an extremely<br/>favourable impression on the deranged lady.<br/><br/>"There,.you can see at once he is a young man that has been well<br/>brought up," she commented aloud, throwing up her hands; "But as<br/>for our other visitors they come in one on the top of another."<br/><br/>"How do you mean, mamma, one on the top of another, how is<br/>that?" muttered the captain affectionately, though a little anxious<br/>on her account.<br/><br/>"That's how they ride in. They get on each other's shoulders in<br/>the passage and prance in like that on a respectable family.<br/>Strange sort of visitors!"<br/><br/>"But who's come in like that, mamma?"<br/><br/>
