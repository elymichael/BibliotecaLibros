"Dmitri Fyodorovitch told me so himself; you can believe him.
The woman who came between us has ruined him; she is the cause of
it all, let me tell you," Grushenka added. She seemed to be
quivering with hatred, and there was a vindictive note in her
voice.

She was again asked to whom she was referring.

"The young lady, Katerina Ivanovna there. She sent for me,
offered me chocolate, tried to fascinate me. There's not much true
shame about her, I can tell you thatâ€¦ "

At this point the President checked her sternly, begging her to
moderate her language. But the jealous woman's heart was burning,
and she did not care what she did.

"When the prisoner was arrested at Mokroe," the prosecutor
asked, "everyone saw and heard you run out of the next room and cry
out: 'It's all my fault. We'll go to Siberia together!' So you
already believed him to have murdered his father?"

"I don't remember what I felt at the time," answered Grushenka.
"Everyone was crying out that he had killed his father, and I felt
that it was my fault, that it was on my account he had murdered
him. But when he said he wasn't guilty, I believed him at once, and
I believe him now and always shall believe him. He is not the man
to tell a lie."

Fetyukovitch began his cross-examination. I remember that among
other things he asked about Rakitin and the twenty-five roubles
"you paid him for bringing Alexey Fyodorovitch Karamazov to see
you."

"There was nothing strange about his taking the money," sneered
Grushenka, with angry contempt. "He was always coming to me for
money: he used to get thirty roubles a month at least out of me,
chiefly for luxuries: he had enough to keep him without my
help."

"What led you to be so liberal to Mr. Rakitin?" Fetyukovitch
asked, in spite of an uneasy movement on the part of the
President.

"Why, he is my cousin. His mother was my mother's sister. But
he's always besought me not to tell anyone here of it, he is so
dreadfully ashamed of me."
