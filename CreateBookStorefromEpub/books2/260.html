<br/>"Excuse me, we don't undertake such business."<br/><br/>Mitya suddenly felt his legs growing weak under him.<br/><br/>"What am I to do now, Kuzma Kuzmitch?" he muttered, with a pale<br/>smile. "I suppose it's all up with me- what do you think?"<br/><br/>"Excuse meâ€¦ "<br/><br/>Mitya remained standing, staring motionless. He suddenly noticed<br/>a movement in the old man's face. He started.<br/><br/>"You see, sir, business of that sort's not in our line," said<br/>the old man slowly. "There's the court, and the lawyers- it's a<br/>perfect misery. But if you like, there is a man here you might<br/>apply to."<br/><br/>"Good heavens! Who is it? You're my salvation, Kuzma Kuzmitch,"<br/>faltered Mitya.<br/><br/>"He doesn't live here, and he's not here just now. He is a<br/>peasant, he does business in timber. His name is Lyagavy. He's been<br/>haggling with Fyodor Pavlovitch for the last year, over your copse<br/>at Tchermashnya. They can't agree on the price, maybe you've heard?<br/>Now he's come back again and is staying with the priest at<br/>Ilyinskoe, about twelve versts from the Volovya station. He wrote<br/>to me, too, about the business of the copse, asking my advice.<br/>Fyodor Pavlovitch means to go and see him himself. So if you were<br/>to be beforehand with Fyodor Pavlovitch and to make Lyagavy the<br/>offer you've made me, he might possibly- "<br/><br/>"A brilliant idea!" Mitya interrupted ecstatically. "He's the<br/>very man, it would just suit him. He's haggling with him for it,<br/>being asked too much, and here he would have all the documents<br/>entitling him to the property itself. Ha ha ha!"<br/><br/>And Mitya suddenly went off into his short, wooden laugh,<br/>startling Samsonov.<br/><br/>
