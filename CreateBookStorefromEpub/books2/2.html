<br/><br/>About Dostoyevsky:<br/><br/>Fyodor Mikhailovich Dostoevsky (November 11 [O.S. October 30]<br/>1821 â€“ February 9 [O.S. January 28] 1881) is considered one of two<br/>greatest prose writers of Russian literature, alongside close<br/>contemporary Leo Tolstoy. Dostoevsky's works have had a profound<br/>and lasting effect on twentieth-century thought and world<br/>literature. Dostoevsky's chief ouevre, mainly novels, explore the<br/>human psychology in the disturbing political, social and spiritual<br/>context of his 19th-century Russian society. Considered by many as<br/>a founder or precursor of 20th-century existentialism, his Notes<br/>from Underground (1864), written in the anonymous, embittered voice<br/>of the Underground Man, is considered by Walter Kaufmann as the<br/>"best overture for existentialism ever written."
