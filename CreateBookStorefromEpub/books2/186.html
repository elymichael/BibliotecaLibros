<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>6<br/>For Awhile a Very Obscure One<br/><br/><br/>AND Ivan, on parting from Alyosha, went home to Fyodor<br/>Pavlovitch's house. But, strange to say, he was overcome by<br/>insufferable depression, which grew greater at every step he took<br/>towards the house. There was nothing strange in his being<br/>depressed; what was strange was that Ivan could not have said what<br/>was the cause of it. He had often been depressed before, and there<br/>was nothing surprising at his feeling so at such a moment, when he<br/>had broken off with everything had brought him here, and was<br/>preparing that day to make a new start and enter upon a new,<br/>unknown future. He would again be as solitary as ever, and though<br/>he had great hopes, and great- too great- expectations from life,<br/>he could not have given any definite account of his hopes, his<br/>expectations, or even his desires.<br/><br/>Yet at that moment, though the apprehension of the new and<br/>unknown certainly found place in his heart, what was worrying him<br/>was something quite different. "Is it loathing for my father's<br/>house?" he wondered. "Quite likely; I am so sick of it; and though<br/>it's the last time I shall cross its hateful threshold, still I<br/>loathe itâ€¦ . No, it's not that either. Is it the parting with<br/>Alyosha and the conversation I had with him? For so many years I've<br/>been silent with the whole world and not deigned to speak, and all<br/>of a sudden I reel off a rigmarole like that." certainly might have<br/>been the youthful vexation of youthful inexperience and vanity-<br/>vexation at having failed to express himself, especially with such<br/>a being as Alyosha, on whom his heart had certainly been reckoning.<br/>No doubt that came in, that vexation, it must have done indeed; but<br/>yet that was not it, that was not it either. "I feel sick with<br/>depression and yet I can't tell what I want. Better not think,<br/>perhaps."<br/><br/>Ivan tried "not to think," but that, too, was no use. What made<br/>his depression so vexatious and irritating was that it had a kind<br/>of casual, external character- he felt that. Some person or thing<br/>seemed to be standing out somewhere, just as something will<br/>sometimes obtrude itself upon the eye, and though one may be so<br/>busy with work or conversation that for a long time one does not<br/>notice it, yet it irritates and almost torments one till at last<br/>one realises, and removes the offending object, often quite a<br/>trifling and ridiculous one- some article left about in the wrong<br/>place, a handkerchief on the floor, a book not replaced on the<br/>shelf, and so on.<br/><br/>At last, feeling very cross and ill-humoured, Ivan arrived home,<br/>and suddenly, about fifteen paces from the garden gate, he guessed<br/>what was fretting and worrying him.<br/><br/>On a bench in the gateway the valet Smerdyakov was sitting<br/>enjoying the coolness of the evening, and at the first glance at<br/>him Ivan knew that the valet Smerdyakov was on his mind, and that<br/>it was this man that his soul loathed. It all dawned upon him<br/>suddenly and became clear. just before, when Alyosha had been<br/>telling him of his meeting with Smerdyakov, he had felt a sudden<br/>twinge of gloom and loathing, which had immediately stirred<br/>responsive anger in his heart. Afterwards, as he talked, Smerdyakov<br/>had been forgotten for the time; but still he had been in his mind,<br/>and as soon as Ivan parted with Alyosha and was walking home, the<br/>forgotten sensation began to obtrude itself again. "Is it possible<br/>that a miserable, contemptible creature like that can worry me so<br/>much?" he wondered, with insufferable irritation.<br/><br/>It was true that Ivan had come of late to feel an intense<br/>dislike for the man, especially during the last few days. He had<br/>even begun to notice in himself a growing feeling that was almost<br/>of hatred for the creature. Perhaps this hatred was accentuated by<br/>the fact that when Ivan first came to the neighbourhood he had felt<br/>quite differently. Then he had taken a marked interest in<br/>Smerdyakov, and had even thought him very original. He had<br/>encouraged him to talk to him, although he had always wondered at a<br/>certain incoherence, or rather restlessness, in his mind, and could<br/>not understand what it was that so continually and insistently<br/>worked upon the brain of "the contemplative." They discussed<br/>philosophical questions and even how there could have been light on<br/>the first day when the sun, moon, and stars were only created on<br/>the fourth day, and how that was to be understood. But Ivan soon<br/>saw that, though the sun, moon, and stars might be an interesting<br/>subject, yet that it was quite secondary to Smerdyakov, and that he<br/>was looking for something altogether different. In one way and<br/>another, he began to betray a boundless vanity, and a wounded<br/>vanity, too, and that Ivan disliked. It had first given rise to his<br/>aversion. Later on, there had been trouble in the house. Grushenka<br/>had come on the scene, and there had been the scandals with his<br/>brother Dmitri- they discussed that, too. But though Smerdyakov<br/>always talked of that with great excitement, it was impossible to<br/>discover what he desired to come of it. There was, in fact,<br/>something surprising in the illogicality and incoherence of some of<br/>his desires, accidentally betrayed and always vaguely expressed.<br/>Smerdyakov was always inquiring, putting certain indirect but<br/>obviously premeditated questions, but what his object was he did<br/>not explain, and usually at the most important moment he would<br/>break off and relapse into silence or pass to another subject. But<br/>what finally irritated Ivan most and confirmed his dislike for him<br/>was the peculiar, revolting familiarity which Smerdyakov began to<br/>show more and more markedly. Not that he forgot himself and was<br/>rude; on the contrary, he always spoke very respectfully, yet he<br/>had obviously begun to consider- goodness knows why!- that there<br/>was some sort of understanding between him and Ivan Fyodorovitch.<br/>He always spoke in a tone that suggested that those two had some<br/>kind of compact, some secret between them, that had at some time<br/>been expressed on both sides, only known to them and beyond the<br/>comprehension of those around them. But for a long while Ivan did<br/>not recognise the real cause of his growing dislike and he had only<br/>lately realised what was at the root of it.<br/><br/>With a feeling of disgust and irritation he tried to pass in at<br/>the gate without speaking or looking at Smerdyakov. But Smerdyakov<br/>rose from the bench, and from that action alone, Ivan knew<br/>instantly that he wanted particularly to talk to him. Ivan looked<br/>at him and stopped, and the fact that he did stop, instead of<br/>passing by, as he meant to the minute before, drove him to fury.<br/>With anger and repulsion he looked at Smerdyakov's emasculate,<br/>sickly face, with the little curls combed forward on his forehead.<br/>His left eye winked and he grinned as if to say, "Where are you<br/>going? You won't pass by; you see that we two clever people have<br/>something to say to each other."<br/>
