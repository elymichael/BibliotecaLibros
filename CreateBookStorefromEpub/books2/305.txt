"Lord, receive me, with all my lawlessness, and do not condemn
me. Let me pass by Thy judgment… do not condemn me, for I have
condemned myself, do not condemn me, for I love Thee, O Lord. I am
a wretch, but I love Thee. If Thou sendest me to hell, I shall love
Thee there, and from there I shall cry out that I love Thee for
ever and ever… . But let me love to the end… . Here and now for
just five hours… till the first light of Thy day… for I love the
queen of my soul… I love her and I cannot help loving her. Thou
seest my whole heart… I shall gallop up, I shall fall before her
and say, 'You are right to pass on and leave me. Farewell and
forget your victim… never fret yourself about me!'"

"Mokroe!" cried Andrey, pointing ahead with his whip.

Through the pale darkness of the night loomed a solid black mass
of buildings, flung down, as it were, in the vast plain. The
village of Mokroe numbered two thousand inhabitants, but at that
hour all were asleep, and only here and there a few lights still
twinkled.

"Drive on, Andrey, I come!" Mitya exclaimed, feverishly.

"They're not asleep," said Andrey again, pointing with his whip
to the Plastunovs' inn, which was at the entrance to the village.
The six windows, looking on the street, were all brightly lighted
up.

"They're not asleep," Mitya repeated joyously. "Quicker, Andrey!
Gallop! Drive up with a dash! Set the bells ringing! Let all know
that I have come. I'm coming! I'm coming, too!"

Andrey lashed his exhausted team into a gallop, drove with a
dash and pulled up his steaming, panting horses at the high flight
of steps.

Mitya jumped out of the cart just as the innkeeper, on his way
to bed, peeped out from the steps curious to see who had
arrived.

"Trifon Borissovitch, is that you?"

The innkeeper bent down, looked intently, ran down the steps,
and rushed up to the guest with obsequious delight.

"Dmitri Fyodorovitch, your honour! Do I see you again?"
