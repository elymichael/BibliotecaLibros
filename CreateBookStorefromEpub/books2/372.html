<br/>"No, I didn't go home," answered Mitya, apparently perfectly<br/>composed, but looking at the floor.<br/><br/>"Allow me then to repeat my question," Nikolay Parfenovitch went<br/>on as though creeping up to the subject. "Where were you able to<br/>procure such a sum all at once, when by your own confession, at<br/>five o'clock the same day you-"<br/><br/>"I was in want of ten roubles and pledged my pistols with<br/>Perhotin, and then went to Madame Hohlakov to borrow three thousand<br/>which she wouldn't give me, and so on, and all the rest of it,"<br/>Mitya interrupted sharply. "Yes, gentlemen, I was in want of it,<br/>and suddenly thousands turned up, eh? Do you know, gentlemen,<br/>you're both afraid now 'what if he won't tell us where he got it?'<br/>That's just how it is. I'm not going to tell you, gentlemen. You've<br/>guessed right. You'll never know," said Mitya, chipping out each<br/>word with extraordinary determination. The lawyers were silent for<br/>a moment.<br/><br/>"You must understand, Mr. Karamazov, that it is of vital<br/>importance for us to know," said Nikolay Parfenovitch, softly and<br/>suavely.<br/><br/>"I understand; but still I won't tell you."<br/><br/>The prosecutor, too, intervened, and again reminded the prisoner<br/>that he was at liberty to refuse to answer questions, if he thought<br/>it to his interest, and so on. But in view of the damage he might<br/>do himself by his silence, especially in a case of such importance<br/>as-<br/><br/>"And so on, gentlemen, and so on. Enough! I've heard that<br/>rigmarole before," Mitya interrupted again. "I can see for myself<br/>how important it is, and that this is the vital point, and still I<br/>won't say."<br/><br/>"What is it to us? It's not our business, but yours. .You are<br/>doing yourself harm," observed Nikolay Parfenovitch nervously.<br/><br/>"You see, gentlemen, joking apart"- Mitya lifted his eyes and<br/>looked firmly at them both- "I had an inkling from the first that<br/>we should come to loggerheads at this point. But at first when I<br/>began to give my evidence, it was all still far away and misty; it<br/>was all floating, and I was so simple that I began with the<br/>supposition of mutual confidence existing between us. Now I can see<br/>for myself that such confidence is out of the question, for in any<br/>case we were bound to come to this cursed stumbling-block. And now<br/>we've come to it! It's impossible and there's an end of it! But I<br/>don't blame you. You can't believe it all simply on my word. I<br/>understand that, of course."<br/><br/>He relapsed into gloomy silence.<br/><br/>
