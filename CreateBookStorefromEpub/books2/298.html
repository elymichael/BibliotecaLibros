As he said this, Mitya suddenly got up.<br/><br/>"Dmitri Fyodorovitch, won't you come now?" called Andrey from<br/>the door of the shop.<br/><br/>"Are you ready? We'll come!" Mitya started. "A few more last<br/>words and- Andrey, a glass of vodka at starting. Give him some<br/>brandy as well! That box" (the one with the pistols) "put under my<br/>seat. Good-bye, Pyotr Ilyitch, don't remember evil against me."<br/><br/>"But you're coming back to-morrow?"<br/><br/>"Will you settle the little bill now?" cried the clerk,<br/>springing forward.<br/><br/>"Oh yes, the bill. Of course."<br/><br/>He pulled the bundle of notes out of his pocket again, picked<br/>out three hundred roubles, threw them on the counter, and ran<br/>hurriedly out of the shop. Everyone followed him out, bowing and<br/>wishing him good luck. Andrey, coughing from the brandy he had just<br/>swallowed, jumped up on the box. But Mitya was only just taking his<br/>seat when suddenly to his surprise he saw Fenya before him. She ran<br/>up panting, clasped her hands before him with a cry, and plumped<br/>down at his feet.<br/><br/>"Dmitri Fyodorovitch, dear good Dmitri Fyodorovitch, don't harm<br/>my mistress. And it was I told you all about it… . And don't murder<br/>him, he came first, he's hers! He'll marry Agrafena Alexandrovna<br/>now. That's why he's come back from Siberia. Dmitri Fyodorovitch,<br/>dear, don't take a fellow creature's life!"<br/><br/>"Tut-tut-tut! That's it, is it? So you're off there to make<br/>trouble!" muttered Pyotr Ilyitch. "Now, it's all clear, as clear as<br/>daylight. Dmitri Fyodorovitch, give me your pistols at once if you<br/>mean to behave like a man," he shouted aloud to Mitya. "Do you<br/>hear, Dmitri?"<br/><br/>"The pistols? Wait a bit, brother, I'll throw them into the pool<br/>on the road," answered Mitya. "Fenya, get up, don't kneel to me.<br/>Mitya won't hurt anyone, the silly fool won't hurt anyone again.<br/>But I say, Fenya," he shouted, after having taken his seat. "I hurt<br/>you just now, so forgive me and have pity on me, forgive a<br/>scoundrel… . But it doesn't matter if you don't. It's all the same<br/>now. Now then, Andrey, look alive, fly along full speed!"<br/><br/>Andrey whipped up the horses, and the bells began ringing.<br/>
