<br/>"There… there! What a girl I am! Blurting things out!" exclaimed<br/>Grushenka, confused and suddenly blushing. "Stay, Alyosha, hush!<br/>Since I've said so much I'll tell the whole truth- he's been to see<br/>him twice, the first directly he arrived. He galloped here from<br/>Moscow at once, of course, before I was taken ill; and the second<br/>time was a week ago. He told Mitya not to tell you about it, under<br/>any circumstances; and not to tell anyone, in fact. He came<br/>secretly."<br/><br/>Alyosha sat plunged in thought, considering something. The news<br/>evidently impressed him.<br/><br/>"Ivan doesn't talk to me of Mitya's case," he said slowly. "He's<br/>said very little to me these last two months. And whenever I go to<br/>see him, he seems vexed at my coming, so I've not been to him for<br/>the last three weeks. H'm!… if he was there a week ago… there<br/>certainly has been a change in Mitya this week."<br/><br/>"There has been a change," Grushenka assented quickly. "They<br/>have a secret, they have a secret! Mitya told me himself there was<br/>a secret, and such a secret that Mitya can't rest. Before then, he<br/>was cheerful- and, indeed, he is cheerful now- but when he shakes<br/>his head like that, you know, and strides about the room and keeps<br/>pulling at the hair on his right temple with his right hand, I know<br/>there is something on his mind worrying him… . I know! He was<br/>cheerful before, though, indeed, he is cheerful to-day."<br/><br/>"But you said he was worried."<br/><br/>"Yes, he is worried and yet cheerful. He keeps on being<br/>irritable for a minute and then cheerful and then irritable again.<br/>And you know, Alyosha, I am constantly wondering at him- with this<br/>awful thing hanging over him, he sometimes laughs at such trifles<br/>as though he were a baby himself."<br/><br/>"And did he really tell you not to tell me about Ivan? Did he<br/>say, 'Don't tell him'?"<br/><br/>"Yes, he told me, 'Don't tell him.' It's you that Mitya's most<br/>afraid of. Because it's a secret: he said himself it was a secret.<br/>Alyosha, darling, go to him and find out what their secret is and<br/>come and tell me," Grushenka besought him with sudden eagerness.<br/>"Set my mind at rest that I may know the worst that's in store for<br/>me. That's why I sent for you."<br/><br/>"You think it's something to do with you? If it were, he<br/>wouldn't have told you there was a secret."<br/><br/>"I don't know. Perhaps he wants to tell me, but doesn't dare to.<br/>He warns me. There is a secret, he tells me, but he won't tell me<br/>what it is."<br/><br/>
