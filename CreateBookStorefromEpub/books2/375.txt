Nikolay Parfenovitch reckoned it all up. Mitya helped him
readily. They recollected every farthing and included it in the
reckoning. Nikolay Parfenovitch hurriedly added up the total. "With
this eight hundred you must have had about fifteen hundred at
first?"

"I suppose so," snapped Mitya.

"How is it they all assert there was much more?"

"Let them assert it."

"But you asserted it yourself."

"Yes, I did, too."

"We will compare all this with the evidence of other persons not
yet examined. Don't be anxious about your money. It will be
properly taken care of and be at your disposal at the conclusion
of… what is beginning… if it appears, or, so to speak, is proved
that you have undisputed right to it. Well, and now… "

Nikolay Parfenovitch suddenly got up, and informed Mitya firmly
that it was his duty and obligation to conduct a minute and
thorough search "of your clothes and everything else… "

"By all means, gentlemen. I'll turn out all my pockets, if you
like."

And he did, in fact, begin turning out his pockets.

"It will be necessary to take off your clothes, too."
