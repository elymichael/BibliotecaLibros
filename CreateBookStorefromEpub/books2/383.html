"Confront him with it."<br/><br/>"Do you recognise this object?"<br/><br/>Nikolay Parfenovitch laid upon the table a large and thick<br/>official envelope, on which three seals still remained intact. The<br/>envelope was empty, and slit open at one end. Mitya stared at it<br/>with open eyes.<br/><br/>"It… it must be that envelope of my father's, the envelope that<br/>contained the three thousand roubles… and if there's inscribed on<br/>it, allow me, 'For my little chicken'… yes- three thousand!" he<br/>shouted, "do you see, three thousand, do you see?"<br/><br/>"Of course, we see. But we didn't find the money in it. It was<br/>empty, and lying on the floor by the bed, behind the screen."<br/><br/>For some seconds Mitya stood as though thunderstruck.<br/><br/>"Gentlemen, it's Smerdyakov!" he shouted suddenly, at the top of<br/>his voice. "It's he who's murdered him! He's robbed him! No one<br/>else knew where the old man hid the envelope. It's Smerdyakov,<br/>that's clear, now!"<br/><br/>"But you, too, knew of the envelope and that it was under the<br/>pillow."<br/><br/>"I never knew it. I've never seen it. This is the first time<br/>I've looked at it. I'd only heard of it from Smerdyakov… . He was<br/>the only one who knew where the old man kept it hidden, I didn't<br/>know… " Mitya was completely breathless.<br/><br/>"But you told us yourself that the envelope was under your<br/>deceased father's pillow. You especially stated that it was under<br/>the pillow, so you must have known it."<br/><br/>"We've got it written down," confirmed Nikolay Parfenovitch.<br/>
