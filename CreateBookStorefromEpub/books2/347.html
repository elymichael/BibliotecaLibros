<br/>Marfa Ignatyevna, the wife of old Grigory, who had been knocked<br/>senseless near the fence, was sleeping soundly in her bed and might<br/>well have slept till morning after the draught she had taken. But,<br/>all of a sudden she waked up, no doubt roused by a fearful<br/>epileptic scream from Smerdyakov, who was lying in the next room<br/>unconscious. That scream always preceded his fits, and always<br/>terrified and upset Marfa Ignatyevna. She could never get<br/>accustomed to it. She jumped up and ran half-awake to Smerdyakov's<br/>room. But it was dark there, and she could only hear the invalid<br/>beginning to gasp and struggle. Then Marfa Ignatyevna herself<br/>screamed out and was going to call her husband, but suddenly<br/>realised that when she had got up, he was not beside her in bed.<br/>She ran back to the bedstead and began groping with her hands, but<br/>the bed was really empty. Then he must have gone out where? She ran<br/>to the steps and timidly called him. She got no answer, of course,<br/>but she caught the sound of groans far away in the garden in the<br/>darkness. She listened. The groans were repeated, and it was<br/>evident they came from the garden.<br/><br/>"Good Lord! just as it was with Lizaveta Smerdyashtchaya!" she<br/>thought distractedly. She went timidly down the steps and saw that<br/>the gate into the garden was open.<br/><br/>"He must be out there, poor dear," she thought. She went up to<br/>the gate and all at once she distinctly heard Grigory calling her<br/>by name, Marfa! Marfa!" in a weak, moaning, dreadful voice.<br/><br/>"Lord, preserve us from harm!" Marfa Ignatyevna murmured, and<br/>ran towards the voice, and that was how she found Grigory. But she<br/>found him not by the fence where he had been knocked down, but<br/>about twenty paces off. It appeared later, that he had crawled away<br/>on coming to himself, and probably had been a long time getting so<br/>far, losing consciousness several times. She noticed at once that<br/>he was covered with blood, and screamed at the top of her voice.<br/>Grigory was muttering incoherently:<br/><br/>"He has murdered… his father murdered… . Why scream, silly… run…<br/>fetch someone… "<br/><br/>But Marfa continued screaming, and seeing that her master's<br/>window was open and that there was a candle alight in the window,<br/>she ran there and began calling Fyodor Pavlovitch. But peeping in<br/>at the window, she saw a fearful sight. Her master was lying on his<br/>back, motionless, on the floor. His light-coloured dressing-gown<br/>and white shirt were soaked with blood. The candle on the table<br/>brightly lighted up the blood and the motionless dead face of<br/>Fyodor Pavlovitch.<br/><br/>Terror-stricken, Marfa rushed away from the window, ran out of<br/>the garden, drew the bolt of the big gate and ran headlong by the<br/>back way to the neighbour, Marya Konndratyevna. Both mother and<br/>daughter were asleep, but they waked up at Marfa's desperate and<br/>persistent screaming and knocking at the shutter. Marfa, shrieking<br/>and screaming incoherently, managed to tell them the main fact, and<br/>to beg for assistance. It happened that Foma had come back from his<br/>wanderings and was staying the night with them. They got him up<br/>immediately and all three ran to the scene of the crime. On the<br/>way, Marya Kondratyevna remembered that at about eight o'clock she<br/>heard a dreadful scream from their garden, and this was no doubt<br/>Grigory's scream, "Parricide!" uttered when he caught hold of<br/>Mitya's leg.<br/><br/>"Some one person screamed out and then was silent," Marya<br/>Kondratyevna explained as she ran. Running to the place where<br/>Grigory lay, the two women with the help of Foma carried him to the<br/>lodge. They lighted a candle and saw that Smerdyakov was no better,<br/>that he was writhing in convulsions, his eyes fixed in a squint,<br/>and that foam was flowing from his lips. They moistened Grigory's<br/>forehead with water mixed with vinager, and the water revived him<br/>at once. He asked immediately:<br/><br/>"Is the master murdered?"<br/><br/>Then Foma and both the women ran to the house and saw this time<br/>that not only the window, but also the door into the garden was<br/>wide open, though Fyodor Pavlovitch had for the last week locked<br/>himself in every night and did not allow even Grigory to come in on<br/>any pretext. Seeing that door open, they were afraid to go in to<br/>Fyodor Pavlovitch "for fear anything should happen afterwards." And<br/>when they returned to Grigory, the old man told them to go straight<br/>to the police captain. Marya Kondratyevna ran there and gave the<br/>alarm to the whole party at the police captain's. She arrived only<br/>five minutes before Pyotr Ilyitch, so that his story came, not as<br/>his own surmise and theory, but as the direct conformation by a<br/>witness, of the theory held by all, as to the identity of the<br/>criminal (a theory he had in the bottom of his heart refused to<br/>believe till that moment).<br/><br/>
