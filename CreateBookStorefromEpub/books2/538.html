<br/>Grigory stood with a perplexed face, looking straight at his<br/>tormentor. Strange to say, it appeared he really did not know what<br/>year it was.<br/><br/>"But perhaps you can tell me how many fingers you have on your<br/>hands?"<br/><br/>"I am a servant," Grigory said suddenly, in a loud and distinct<br/>voice. "If my betters think fit to make game of me, it is my duty<br/>to suffer it."<br/><br/>Fetyukovitch was a little taken aback, and the President<br/>intervened, reminding him that he must ask more relevant questions.<br/>Fetyukovitch bowed with dignity and said that he had no more<br/>questions to ask of the witness. The public and the jury, of<br/>course, were left with a grain of doubt in their minds as to the<br/>evidence of a man who might, while undergoing a certain cure, have<br/>seen "the gates of heaven," and who did not even know what year he<br/>was living in. But before Grigory left the box another episode<br/>occurred. The President, turning to the prisoner, asked him whether<br/>he had any comment to make on the evidence of the last witness.<br/><br/>"Except about the door, all he has said is true," cried Mitya,<br/>in a loud voice. "For combing the lice off me, I thank him; for<br/>forgiving my blows, I thank him. The old man has been honest all<br/>his life and as faithful to my father as seven hundred<br/>poodles."<br/><br/>"Prisoner, be careful in your language," the President<br/>admonished him.<br/><br/>"I am not a poodle," Grigory muttered.<br/><br/>"All right, it's I am a poodle myself," cried Mitya. "If it's an<br/>insult, I take it to myself and I beg his pardon. I was a beast and<br/>cruel to him. I was cruel to Aesop too."<br/><br/>"What Aesop?" the President asked sternly again.<br/><br/>"Oh, Pierrotâ€¦ my father, Fyodor Pavlovitch."<br/><br/>
