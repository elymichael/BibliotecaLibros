"That I certainly will, without fail," cried Fyodor Pavlovitch,<br/>hugely delighted at the invitation. "And, believe me, we've all<br/>given our word to behave properly here… . And you, Pyotr<br/>Alexandrovitch, will you go, too?"<br/><br/>"Yes, of course. What have I come for but to study all the<br/>customs here? The only obstacle to me is your company… ."<br/><br/>"Yes, Dmitri Fyodorovitch is non-existent as yet."<br/><br/>"It would be a capital thing if he didn't turn up. Do you<br/>suppose I like all this business, and in your company, too? So we<br/>will come to dinner. Thank the Father Superior," he said to the<br/>monk.<br/><br/>"No, it is my duty now to conduct you to the elder," answered<br/>the monk.<br/><br/>"If so I'll go straight to the Father Superior- to the Father<br/>Superior," babbled Maximov.<br/><br/>"The Father Superior is engaged just now. But as you please- "<br/>the monk hesitated.<br/><br/>"Impertinent old man!" Miusov observed aloud, while Maximov ran<br/>back to the monastery.<br/><br/>"He's like von Sohn," Fyodor Pavlovitch said suddenly.<br/><br/>"Is that all you can think of?… In what way is he like von Sohn?<br/>Have you ever seen von Sohn?"<br/><br/>"I've seen his portrait. It's not the features, but something<br/>indefinable. He's a second von Sohn. I can always tell from the<br/>physiognomy."<br/>
