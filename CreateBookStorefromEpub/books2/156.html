<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>1<br/>The Engagement<br/><br/><br/>MADAME HOHLAKOV was again the first to meet Alyosha. She was<br/>flustered; something important had happened. Katerina Ivanovna's<br/>hysterics had ended in a fainting fit, and then "a terrible, awful<br/>weakness had followed, she lay with her eyes turned up and was<br/>delirious. Now she was in a fever. They had sent for Herzenstube;<br/>they had sent for the aunts. The aunts were already here, but<br/>Herzenstube had not yet come. They were all sitting in her room,<br/>waiting. She was unconscious now, and what if it turned to brain<br/>fever!"<br/><br/>Madame Hohlakov looked gravely alarmed. "This is serious,<br/>serious," she added at every word, as though nothing that had<br/>happened to her before had been serious. Alyosha listened with<br/>distress, and was beginning to describe his adventures, but she<br/>interrupted him at the first words. She had not time to listen. She<br/>begged him to sit with Lise and wait for her there.<br/><br/>"Lise," she whispered almost in his ear, "Lise has greatly<br/>surprised me just now, dear Alexey Fyodorovitch. She touched me,<br/>too, and so my heart forgives her everything. Only fancy, as soon<br/>as you had gone, she began to be truly remorseful for having<br/>laughed at you to-day and yesterday, though she was not laughing at<br/>you, but only joking. But she was seriously sorry for it, almost<br/>ready to cry, so that I was quite surprised. She has never been<br/>really sorry for laughing at me, but has only made a joke of it.<br/>And you know she is laughing at me every minute. But this time she<br/>was in earnest She thinks a great deal of your opinion, Alexey<br/>Fyodorovitch, and don't take offence or be wounded by her if you<br/>can help it. I am never hard upon her, for she's such a clever<br/>little thing. Would you believe it? She said just now that you were<br/>a friend of her childhood, 'the greatest friend of her childhood'-<br/>just think of that- 'greatest friend'- and what about me? She has<br/>very strong feelings and memories, and, what's more, she uses these<br/>phrases, most unexpected words, which come out all of a sudden when<br/>you least expect them. She spoke lately about a pine-tree, for<br/>instance: there used to be a pine-tree standing in our garden in<br/>her early childhood. Very likely it's standing there still; so<br/>there's no need to speak in the past tense. Pine-trees are not like<br/>people, Alexey Fyodorovitch, they don't change quickly. 'Mamma,'<br/>she said, 'I remember this pine tree as in a dream,' only she said<br/>something so original about it that I can't repeat it. Besides,<br/>I've forgotten it. Well, good-bye! I am so worried I feel I shall<br/>go out of my mind. Ah! Alexey Fyodorovitch, I've been out of my<br/>mind twice in my life. Go to Lise, cheer her up, as you always can<br/>so charmingly. Lise," she cried, going to her door, "here I've<br/>brought you Alexey Fyodorovitch, whom you insulted so. He is not at<br/>all angry, I assure you; on the contrary, he is surprised that you<br/>could suppose so."<br/><br/>"Merci, maman. Come in, Alexey Fyodorovitch."<br/><br/>Alyosha went in. Lise looked rather embarrassed, and at once<br/>flushed crimson. She was evidently ashamed of something, and, as<br/>people always do in such cases, she began immediately talking of<br/>other things, as though they were of absorbing interest to her at<br/>the moment.<br/><br/>"Mamma has just told me all about the two hundred roubles,<br/>Alexey Fyodorovitch, and your taking them to that poor officer… and<br/>she told me all the awful story of how he had been insulted… and<br/>you know, although mamma muddles things… she always rushes from one<br/>thing to another… I cried when I heard. Well, did you give him the<br/>money and how is that poor man getting on?"<br/><br/>"The fact is I didn't give it to him, and it's a long story,"<br/>answered Alyosha, as though he, too, could think of nothing but his<br/>regret at having failed, yet Lise saw perfectly well that he, too,<br/>looked away, and that he, too, was trying to talk of other<br/>things.<br/>
