<br/>Alyosha went, opened the door, and reported that no one was<br/>listening.<br/><br/>"Come here, Alexey Fyodorovitch," Lise went on, flushing redder<br/>and redder. "Give me your hand- that's right. I have to make a<br/>great confession. I didn't write to you yesterday in joke, but in<br/>earnest," and she hid her eyes with her hand. It was evident that<br/>she was greatly ashamed of the confession.<br/><br/>Suddenly she snatched his hand and impulsively kissed it three<br/>times.<br/><br/>"Ah, Lise, what a good thing!" cried Alyosha joyfully. "You<br/>know, I was perfectly sure you were in earnest."<br/><br/>"Sure? Upon my word! She put aside his hand, but did not leave<br/>go of it, blushing hotly, and laughing a little happy laugh. "I<br/>kiss his hand and he says, 'What a good thing!'"<br/><br/>But her reproach was undeserved. Alyosha, too, was greatly<br/>overcome.<br/><br/>"I should like to please you always, Lise, but don't know how to<br/>do it." he muttered, blushing too.<br/><br/>"Alyosha, dear, you are cold and rude. Do you see? He has chosen<br/>me as his wife and is quite settled about it. He is sure I was in<br/>earnest. What a thing to say! Why, that's impertinence- that's what<br/>it is."<br/><br/>"Why, was it wrong of me to feel sure?" Alyosha asked, laughing<br/>suddenly.<br/><br/>"Ah, Alyosha, on the contrary, it was delightfully right," cried<br/>Lise, looking tenderly and happily at him.<br/><br/>
