"You must tell me all that afterwards, afterwards!" Madame
Hohlakov with a gesture demanded silence in her turn, "and whatever
you may tell me, I know it all beforehand; I've told you so
already. You ask for a certain sum, for three thousand, but I can
give you more, immeasurably more; I will save you, Dmitri
Fyodorovitch, but you must listen to me."

Mitya started from his seat again.

"Madam, will you really be so good!" he cried, with strong
feeling. "Good God, you've saved me! You have saved a man from a
violent death, from a bulletâ€¦ . My eternal gratitude "I will give
you more, infinitely more than three thousand!" cried Madame
Hohlakov, looking with a radiant smile at Mitya's ecstasy.

"Infinitely? But I don't need so much. I only need that fatal
three thousand, and on my part I can give security for that sum
with infinite gratitude, and I propose a plan which-"

"Enough, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, it's said and done." Madame
Hohlakov cut him short, with the modest triumph of beneficence. "I
have promised to save you, and I will save you. I will save you as
I did Belmesov. What do you think of the gold mines, Dmitri
Fyodorovitch?"

"Of the gold mines, madam? I have never thought anything about
them."

"But I have thought of them for you. Thought of them over and
over again. I have been watching you for the last month. I've
watched you a hundred times as you've walked past, saying to
myself: That's a man of energy who ought to be at the gold mines.
I've studied your gait and come to the conclusion: that's a man who
would find gold."

"From my gait, madam?" said Mitya, smiling.

"Yes, from your gait. You surely don't deny that character can
be told from the gait, Dmitri Fyodorovitch? Science supports the
idea. I'm all for science and realism now. After all this business
with Father Zossima, which has so upset me, from this very day I'm
a realist and I want to devote myself to practical usefulness. I'm
cured. 'Enough!' as Turgeney says."

"But madam, the three thousand you so generously promised to
lend me-"
