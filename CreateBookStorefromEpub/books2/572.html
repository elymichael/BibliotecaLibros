<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>11<br/>There Was No Money. There Was No Robbery<br/><br/><br/>THERE was one point that struck everyone in Fetyukovitch's<br/>speech. He flatly denied the existence of the fatal three thousand<br/>roubles, and consequently, the possibility of their having been<br/>stolen.<br/><br/>"Gentlemen of the jury," he began. "Every new and unprejudiced<br/>observer must be struck by a characteristic peculiarity in the<br/>present case, namely, the charge of robbery, and the complete<br/>impossibility of proving that there was anything to be stolen. We<br/>are told that money was stolen- three thousand roubles but whether<br/>those roubles ever existed, nobody knows. Consider, how have we<br/>heard of that sum, and who has seen the notes? The only person who<br/>saw them, and stated that they had been put in the envelope, was<br/>the servant, Smerdyakov. He had spoken of it to the prisoner and<br/>his brother, Ivan Fyodorovitch, before the catastrophe. Madame<br/>Svyetlov, too, had been told of it. But not one of these three<br/>persons had actually seen the notes, no one but Smerdyakov had seen<br/>them.<br/><br/>"Here the question arises, if it's true that they did exist, and<br/>that Smerdyakov had seen them, when did he see them for the last<br/>time? What if his master had taken the notes from under his bed and<br/>put them back in his cash-box without telling him? Note, that<br/>according to Smerdyakov's story the notes were kept under the<br/>mattress; the prisoner must have pulled them out, and yet the bed<br/>was absolutely unrumpled; that is carefully recorded in the<br/>protocol. How could the prisoner have found the notes without<br/>disturbing the bed? How could he have helped soiling with his<br/>blood-stained hands the fine and spotless linen with which the bed<br/>had been purposely made?<br/><br/>"But I shall be asked: What about the envelope on the floor?<br/>Yes, it's worth saying a word or two about that envelope. I was<br/>somewhat surprised just now to hear the highly talented prosecutor<br/>declare of himself- of himself, observe- that but for that<br/>envelope, but for its being left on the floor, no one in the world<br/>would have known of the existence of that envelope and the notes in<br/>it, and therefore of the prisoner's having stolen it. And so that<br/>torn scrap of paper is, by the prosecutor's own admission, the sole<br/>proof on which the charge of robbery rests, 'otherwise no one would<br/>have known of the robbery, nor perhaps even of the money.' But is<br/>the mere fact that that scrap of paper was lying on the floor a<br/>proof that there was money in it, and that that money had been<br/>stolen? Yet, it will be objected, Smerdyakov had seen the money in<br/>the envelope. But when, when had he seen it for the last time, I<br/>ask you that? I talked to Smerdyakov, and he told me that he had<br/>seen the notes two days before the catastrophe. Then why not<br/>imagine that old Fyodor Pavlovitch, locked up alone in impatient<br/>and hysterical expectation of the object of his adoration, may have<br/>whiled away the time by breaking open the envelope and taking out<br/>the notes. 'What's the use of the envelope?' he may have asked<br/>himself. 'She won't believe the notes are there, but when I show<br/>her the thirty rainbow-coloured notes in one roll, it will make<br/>more impression, you may be sure, it will make her mouth water.'<br/>And so he tears open the envelope, takes out the money, and flings<br/>the envelope on the floor, conscious of being the owner and<br/>untroubled by any fears of leaving evidence.<br/><br/>"Listen, gentlemen, could anything be more likely than this<br/>theory and such an action? Why is it out of the question? But if<br/>anything of the sort could have taken place, the charge of robbery<br/>falls to the ground; if there was no money, there was no theft of<br/>it. If the envelope on the floor may be taken as evidence that<br/>there had been money in it, why may I not maintain the opposite,<br/>that the envelope was on the floor because the money had been taken<br/>from it by its owner?<br/><br/>"But I shall be asked what became of the money if Fyodor<br/>Pavlovitch took it out of the envelope since it was not found when<br/>the police searched the house? In the first place, part of the<br/>money was found in the cash-box, and secondly, he might have taken<br/>it out that morning or the evening before to make some other use of<br/>it, to give or send it away; he may have changed his idea, his plan<br/>of action completely, without thinking it necessary to announce the<br/>fact to Smerdyakov beforehand. And if there is the barest<br/>possibility of such an explanation, how can the prisoner be so<br/>positively accused of having committed murder for the sake of<br/>robbery, and of having actually carried out that robbery? This is<br/>encroaching on the domain of romance. If it is maintained that<br/>something has been stolen, the thing must be produced, or at least<br/>its existence must be proved beyond doubt. Yet no one had ever seen<br/>these notes.<br/><br/>"Not long ago in Petersburg a young man of eighteen, hardly more<br/>than a boy, who carried on a small business as a costermonger, went<br/>in broad daylight into a moneychanger's shop with an axe, and with<br/>extraordinary, typical audacity killed the master of the shop and<br/>carried off fifteen hundred roubles. Five hours later he was<br/>arrested, and, except fifteen roubles he had already managed to<br/>spend, the whole sum was found on him. Moreover, the shopman, on<br/>his return to the shop after the murder, informed the police not<br/>only of the exact sum stolen, but even of the notes and gold coins<br/>of which that sum was made up, and those very notes and coins were<br/>found on the criminal. This was followed by a full and genuine<br/>confession on the part of the murderer. That's what I call<br/>evidence, gentlemen of the jury! In that case I know, I see, I<br/>touch the money, and cannot deny its existence. Is it the same in<br/>the present case? And yet it is a question of life and death.<br/>
