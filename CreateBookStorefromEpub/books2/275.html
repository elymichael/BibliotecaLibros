"Three thousand? Roubles? Oh, no, I haven't got three thousand,"<br/>Madame Hohlakov announced with serene amazement. Mitya was<br/>stupefied.<br/><br/>"Why, you said just now you saidâ€¦ you said it was as good as in<br/>my hands-"<br/><br/>"Oh, no, you misunderstood me, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. In that case<br/>you misunderstood me. I was talking of the gold mines. It's true I<br/>promised you more, infinitely more than three thousand, I remember<br/>it all now, but I was referring to the gold mines."<br/><br/>"But the money? The three thousand?" Mitya exclaimed,<br/>awkwardly.<br/><br/>"Oh, if you meant money, I haven't any. I haven't a penny,<br/>Dmitri Fyodorovitch. I'm quarrelling with my steward about it, and<br/>I've just borrowed five hundred roubles from Miusov, myself. No,<br/>no, I've no money. And, do you know, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, if I had,<br/>I wouldn't give it to you. In the first place I never lend money.<br/>Lending money means losing friends. And I wouldn't give it to you<br/>particularly. I wouldn't give it you, because I like you and want<br/>to save you, for all you need is the gold mines, the gold mines,<br/>the gold mines!"<br/><br/>"Oh, the devil!" roared Mitya, and with all his might brought<br/>his fist down on the table.<br/><br/>"Aie! Aie!" cried Madame Hohlakov, alarmed, and she flew to the<br/>other end of the drawing-room.<br/><br/>Mitya spat on the ground, and strode rapidly out of the room,<br/>out of the house, into the street, into the darkness! He walked<br/>like one possessed, and beating himself on the breast, on the spot<br/>where he had struck himself two days previously, before Alyosha,<br/>the last time he saw him in the dark, on the road. What those blows<br/>upon his breast signified, on that spot, and what he meant by it-<br/>that was, for the time, a secret which was known to no one in the<br/>world, and had not been told even to Alyosha. But that secret meant<br/>for him more than disgrace; it meant ruin, suicide. So he had<br/>determined, if he did not get hold of the three thousand that would<br/>pay his debt to Katerina Ivanovna, and so remove from his breast,<br/>from that spot on his breast, the shame he carried upon it, that<br/>weighed on his conscience. All this will be fully explained to the<br/>reader later on, but now that his last hope had vanished, this man,<br/>so strong in appearance, burst out crying like a little child a few<br/>steps from the Hohlakovs' house. He walked on, and not knowing what<br/>he was doing, wiped away his tears with his fist. In this way he<br/>reached the square, and suddenly became aware that he had stumbled<br/>against something. He heard a piercing wail from an old woman whom<br/>he had almost knocked down.<br/><br/>"Good Lord, you've nearly killed me! Why don't you look where<br/>you're going, scapegrace?"<br/><br/>"Why, it's you!" cried Mitya, recognising the old woman in the<br/>dark. It was the old servant who waited on Samsonov, whom Mitya had<br/>particularly noticed the day before.<br/><br/>"And who are you, my good sir?" said the old woman in quite a<br/>different voice. "I don't know you in the dark."<br/>
