<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>3<br/>The Confession of a Passionate Heart- in Verse<br/><br/><br/>ALYOSHA remained for some time irresolute after hearing the<br/>command his father shouted to him from the carriage. But in spite<br/>of his uneasiness he did not stand still. That was not his way. He<br/>went at once to the kitchen to find out what his father had been<br/>doing above. Then he set off, trusting that on the way he would<br/>find some answer to the doubt tormenting him. I hasten to add that<br/>his father's shouts, commanding him to return home "with his<br/>mattress and pillow" did not frighten him in the least. He<br/>understood perfectly that those peremptory shouts were merely "a<br/>flourish" to produce an effect. In the same way a tradesman in our<br/>town who was celebrating his name-day with a party of friends,<br/>getting angry at being refused more vodka, smashed up his own<br/>crockery and furniture and tore his own and his wife's clothes, and<br/>finally broke his windows, all for the sake of effect. Next day, of<br/>course, when he was sober, he regretted the broken cups and<br/>saucers. Alyosha knew that his father would let him go back to the<br/>monastery next day, possibly even that evening. Moreover, he was<br/>fully persuaded that his father might hurt anyone else, but would<br/>not hurt him. Alyosha was certain that no one in the whole world<br/>ever would want to hurt him, and, what is more, he knew that no one<br/>could hurt him. This was for him an axiom, assumed once for all<br/>without question, and he went his way without hesitation, relying<br/>on it.<br/><br/>But at that moment an anxiety of sort disturbed him, and worried<br/>him the more because he could not formulate it. It was the fear of<br/>a woman, of Katerina Ivanovna, who had so urgently entreated him in<br/>the note handed to him by Madame Hohlakov to come and see her about<br/>something. This request and the necessity of going had at once<br/>aroused an uneasy feeling in his heart, and this feeling had grown<br/>more and more painful all the morning in spite of the scenes at the<br/>hermitage and at the Father Superior's. He was not uneasy because<br/>he did not know what she would speak of and what he must answer.<br/>And he was not afraid of her simply as a woman. Though he knew<br/>little of women, he spent his life, from early childhood till he<br/>entered the monastery, entirely with women. He was afraid of that<br/>woman, Katerina Ivanovna. He had been afraid of her from the first<br/>time he saw her. He had only seen her two or three times, and had<br/>only chanced to say a few words to her. He thought of her as a<br/>beautiful, proud, imperious girl. It was not her beauty which<br/>troubled him, but something else. And the vagueness of his<br/>apprehension increased the apprehension itself. The girl's aims<br/>were of the noblest, he knew that. She was trying to save his<br/>brother Dmitri simply through generosity, though he had already<br/>behaved badly to her. Yet, although Alyosha recognised and did<br/>justice to all these fine and generous sentiments, a shiver began<br/>to run down his back as soon as he drew near her house.<br/><br/>He reflected that he would not find Ivan, who was so intimate a<br/>friend, with her, for Ivan was certainly now with his father.<br/>Dmitri he was even more certain not to find there, and he had a<br/>foreboding of the reason. And so his conversation would be with her<br/>alone. He had a great longing to run and see his brother Dmitri<br/>before that fateful interview. Without showing him the letter, he<br/>could talk to him about it. But Dmitri lived a long way off, and he<br/>was sure to be away from home too. Standing still for a minute, he<br/>reached a final decision. Crossing himself with a rapid and<br/>accustomed gesture, and at once smiling, he turned resolutely in<br/>the direction of his terrible lady.<br/><br/>He knew her house. If he went by the High Street and then across<br/>the market-place, it was a long way round. Though our town is<br/>small, it is scattered, and the houses are far apart. And meanwhile<br/>his father was expecting him, and perhaps had not yet forgotten his<br/>command. He might be unreasonable, and so he had to make haste to<br/>get there and back. So he decided to take a short cut by the<br/>backway, for he knew every inch of the ground. This meant skirting<br/>fences, climbing over hurdles, and crossing other people's<br/>back-yards, where everyone he met knew him and greeted him. In this<br/>way he could reach the High Street in half the time.<br/><br/>He had to pass the garden adjoining his father's, and belonging<br/>to a little tumbledown house with four windows. The owner of this<br/>house, as Alyosha knew, was a bedridden old woman, living with her<br/>daughter, who had been a genteel maid-servant in generals' families<br/>in Petersburg. Now she had been at home a year, looking after her<br/>sick mother. She always dressed up in fine clothes, though her old<br/>mother and she had sunk into such poverty that they went every day<br/>to Fyodor Pavlovitch's kitchen for soup and bread, which Marfa gave<br/>readily. Yet, though the young woman came up for soup, she had<br/>never sold any of her dresses, and one of these even had a long<br/>train- a fact which Alyosha had learned from Rakitin, who always<br/>knew everything that was going on in the town. He had forgotten it<br/>as soon as he heard it, but now, on reaching the garden, he<br/>remembered the dress with the train, raised his head, which had<br/>been bowed in thought, and came upon something quite<br/>unexpected.<br/><br/>Over the hurdle in the garden, Dmitri, mounted on something, was<br/>leaning forward, gesticulating violently, beckoning to him,<br/>obviously afraid to utter a word for fear of being overheard.<br/>Alyosha ran up to the hurdle.<br/><br/>"It's a good thing you looked up. I was nearly shouting to you,"<br/>Mitya said in a joyful, hurried whisper. "Climb in here quickly!<br/>How splendid that you've come! I was just thinking of you"<br/>
