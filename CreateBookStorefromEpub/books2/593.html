<br/>"You've spoken of that already," Mitya observed musingly.<br/><br/>"And you have repeated it to Grusha," observed Alyosha.<br/><br/>"Yes," Mitya admitted. "She won't come this morning." He looked<br/>timidly at his brother. "She won't come till the evening. When I<br/>told her yesterday that Katya was taking measures, she was silent,<br/>but she set her mouth. She only whispered, 'Let her!' She<br/>understood that it was important. I did not dare to try her<br/>further. She understands now, I think, that Katya no longer cares<br/>for me, but loves Ivan."<br/><br/>"Does she?" broke from Alyosha.<br/><br/>"Perhaps she does not. Only she is not coming this morning,"<br/>Mitya hastened to explain again; "I asked her to do something for<br/>me. You know, Ivan is superior to all of us. He ought to live, not<br/>us. He will recover."<br/><br/>"Would you believe it, though Katya is alarmed about him, she<br/>scarcely doubts of his recovery," said Alyosha.<br/><br/>"That means that she is convinced he will die. It's because she<br/>is frightened she's so sure he will get well."<br/><br/>"Ivan has a strong constitution, and I, too, believe there's<br/>every hope that he will get well," Alyosha observed anxiously.<br/><br/>"Yes, he will get well. But she is convinced that he will die.<br/>She has a great deal of sorrow to bearâ€¦ " A silence followed. A<br/>grave anxiety was fretting Mitya.<br/><br/>"Alyosha, I love Grusha terribly," he said suddenly in a shaking<br/>voice, full of tears.<br/><br/>
