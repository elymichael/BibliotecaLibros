<br/>"First of all, answer the question, where did you get hurt like<br/>this?" she asked Alyosha, quickly. "And then I'll talk to you about<br/>something quite different. Well?"<br/><br/>Instinctively feeling that the time of her mother's absence was<br/>precious for her, Alyosha hastened to tell her of his enigmatic<br/>meeting with the school boys in the fewest words possible. Lise<br/>clasped her hands at his story.<br/><br/>"How can you, and in that dress too, associate with schoolboys?"<br/>she cried angrily, as though she had a right to control him.

I beg your pardon for that silliness, but you must<br/>bring me the letter, if you really haven't got it- bring to-day,<br/>you must, you must."<br/><br/>"To-day I can't possibly, for I am going back to the monastery<br/>and I shan't come and see you for the next two days- three or four<br/>perhaps- for Father Zossima- "<br/><br/>
