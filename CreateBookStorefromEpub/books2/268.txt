He was saved by meeting an old merchant who was being driven
across country in a hired trap. When he overtook him, Mitya asked
the way and it turned out that the old merchant, too, was going to
Volovya. After some discussion Mitya got into the trap. Three hours
later they arrived. At Volovya, Mitya at once ordered
posting-horses to drive to the town, and suddenly realised that he
was appallingly hungry. While the horses were being harnessed, an
omelette was prepared for him. He ate it all in an instant, ate a
huge hunk of bread, ate a sausage, and swallowed three glasses of
vodka. After eating, his spirits and his heart grew lighter. He
flew towards the town, urged on the driver, and suddenly made a new
and "unalterable" plan to procure that "accursed money" before
evening. "And to think, only to think that a man's life should be
ruined for the sake of that paltry three thousand!" he cried,
contemptuously. "I'll settle it to-day." And if it had not been for
the thought of Grushenka and of what might have happened to her,
which never left him, he would perhaps have become quite cheerful
againâ€¦ . But the thought of her was stabbing him to the heart every
moment, like a sharp knife.

At last they arrived, and Mitya at once ran to Grushenka.
