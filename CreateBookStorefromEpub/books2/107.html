She slowly raised the hands to her lips, with the strange object<br/>indeed of "being even" with her in kisses.<br/><br/>Katerina Ivanovna did not take her hand away. She listened with<br/>timid hope to the last words, though Grushenka's promise to do her<br/>bidding like a slave was very strangely expressed. She looked<br/>intently into her eyes; she still saw in those eyes the same<br/>simple-hearted, confiding expression, the same bright gaiety.<br/><br/>"She's perhaps too naive," thought Katerina Ivanovna, with a<br/>gleam of hope.<br/><br/>Grushenka meanwhile seemed enthusiastic over the "sweet hand."<br/>She raised it deliberately to her lips. But she held it for two or<br/>three minutes near her lips, as though reconsidering something.<br/><br/>"Do you know, angel lady," she suddenly drawled in an even more<br/>soft and sugary voice, "do you know, after all, I think I won't<br/>kiss your hand?" And she laughed a little merry laugh.<br/><br/>"As you please. What's the matter with you?" said Katerina<br/>Ivanovna, starting suddenly.<br/><br/>"So that you may be left to remember that you kissed my hand,<br/>but I didn't kiss yours."<br/><br/>There was a sudden gleam in her eyes. She looked with awful<br/>intentness at Katerina Ivanovna.<br/><br/>"Insolent creature!" cried Katerina Ivanovna, as though suddenly<br/>grasping something. She flushed all over and leapt up from her<br/>seat.<br/><br/>Grushenka too got up, but without haste.<br/><br/>"So I shall tell Mitya how you kissed my hand, but I didn't kiss<br/>yours at all. And how he will laugh!"<br/>
