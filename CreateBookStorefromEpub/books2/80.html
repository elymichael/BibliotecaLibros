<br/>"Mitya, you are unhappy, yes! But not as unhappy as you think.<br/>Don't worry yourself to death with despair."<br/><br/>"What, do you suppose I'd shoot myself because I can't get three<br/>thousand to pay back? That's just it. I shan't shoot myself. I<br/>haven't the strength now. Afterwards, perhaps. But now I'm going to<br/>Grushenka. I don't care what happens."<br/><br/>"And what then?"<br/><br/>"I'll be her husband if she deigns to have me, and when lovers<br/>come, I'll go into the next room. I'll clean her friends' goloshes,<br/>blow up their samovar, run their errands."<br/><br/>"Katerina Ivanovna will understand it all," Alyosha said<br/>solemnly. "She'll understand how great this trouble is and will<br/>forgive. She has a lofty mind, and no one could be more unhappy<br/>than you. She'll see that for herself."<br/><br/>"She won't forgive everything," said Dmitri, with a grin.<br/>"There's something in it, brother, that no woman could forgive. Do<br/>you know what would be the best thing to do?"<br/><br/>"What?"<br/><br/>"Pay back the three thousand."<br/><br/>"Where can we get it from? I say, I have two thousand. Ivan will<br/>give you another thousand- that makes three. Take it and pay it<br/>back."<br/><br/>"And when would you get it, your three thousand? You're not of<br/>age, besides, and you must- you absolutely must- take my farewell<br/>to her to-day, with the money or without it, for I can't drag on<br/>any longer, things have come to such a pass. To-morrow is too late.<br/>I shall send you to father."<br/><br/>
