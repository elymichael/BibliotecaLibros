"Whatever do you want to go picking quarrels with everyone for?…<br/>Just as you did with that captain over some nonsense… . You've been<br/>fighting and now you're rushing off on the spree- that's you all<br/>over! Three dozen champagne- what do you want all that for?"<br/><br/>"Bravo! Now give me the pistols. Upon my honour I've no time<br/>now. I should like to have a chat with you, my dear boy, but I<br/>haven't the time. And there's no need, it's too late for talking.<br/>Where's my money? Where have I put it?" he cried, thrusting his<br/>hands into his pockets.<br/><br/>"You put it on the table… yourself… . Here it is. Had you<br/>forgotten? Money's like dirt or water to you, it seems. Here are<br/>your pistols. It's an odd thing, at six o'clock you pledged them<br/>for ten roubles, and now you've got thousands. Two or three I<br/>should say."<br/><br/>"Three, you bet," laughed Mitya, stuffing the notes into the<br/>side-pocket of his trousers.<br/><br/>"You'll lose it like that. Have you found a gold mine?"<br/><br/>"The mines? The gold mines?" Mitya shouted at the top of his<br/>voice and went off into a roar of laughter. "Would you like to go<br/>to the mines, Perhotin? There's a lady here who'll stump up three<br/>thousand for you, if only you'll go. She did it for me, she's so<br/>awfully fond of gold mines. Do you know Madame Hohlakov?"<br/><br/>"I don't know her, but I've heard of her and seen her. Did she<br/>really give you three thousand? Did she really?" said Pyotr<br/>Ilyitch, eyeing him dubiously.<br/><br/>"As soon as the sun rises to-morrow, as soon as Phoebus, ever<br/>young, flies upwards, praising and glorifying God, you go to her,<br/>this Madame Hohlakov, and ask her whether she did stump up that<br/>three thousand or not. Try and find out."<br/><br/>"I don't know on what terms you are… since you say it so<br/>positively, I suppose she did give it to you. You've got the money<br/>in your hand, but instead of going to Siberia you're spending it<br/>all… . Where are you really off to now, eh?"<br/><br/>"To Mokroe."<br/><br/>"To Mokroe? But it's night!"<br/>
