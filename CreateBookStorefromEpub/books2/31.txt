"By the way, I have a thing to ask, not a great one. Here are
sixty copecks. Give them, dear Father, to someone poorer than me. I
thought as I came along, better give through him. He'll know whom
to give to."

"Thanks, my dear, thanks! You are a good woman. I love you. I
will do so certainly. Is that your little girl?"

"My little girl, Father, Lizaveta."

"May the Lord bless you both, you and your babe Lizaveta! You
have gladdened my heart, mother. Farewell, dear children, farewell,
dear ones."

He blessed them all and bowed low to them.
