"Not at all, I can go quite well," said Alyosha.

"What! You are going away? Is that what you say?"

"Well, when I've seen them, I'll come back here and we can talk
as much as you like. But I should like to see Katerina Ivanovna at
once, for I am very anxious to be back at the monastery as soon as
I can."

"Mamma, take him away quickly. Alexey Fyodorovitch, don't
trouble to come and see me afterwards, but go straight back to your
monastery and a good riddance. I want to sleep, I didn't sleep all
night."

"Ah, Lise, you are only making fun, but how I wish you would
sleep!" cried Madame Hohlakov.

"I don't know what I've doneâ€¦ . I'll stay another three minutes,
five if you like," muttered Alyosha.

"Even five! Do take him away quickly, mamma, he is a
monster."

"Lise, you are crazy. Let us go, Alexey Fyodorovitch, she is too
capricious to-day. I am afraid to cross her. Oh, the trouble one
has with nervous girls! Perhaps she really will be able to sleep
after seeing you. How quickly you have made her sleepy, and how
fortunate it is!"

"Ah, mamma, how sweetly you talk! I must kiss you for it,
mamma."

"And I kiss you too, Lise. Listen, Alexey Fyodorovitch," Madame
Hohlakov began mysteriously and importantly, speaking in a rapid
whisper. "I don't want to suggest anything, I don't want to lift
the veil, you will see for yourself what's going on. It's
appalling. It's the most fantastic farce. She loves your brother,
Ivan, and she is doing her utmost to persuade herself she loves
your brother, Dmitri. It's appalling! I'll go in with you, and if
they don't turn me out, I'll stay to the end."
