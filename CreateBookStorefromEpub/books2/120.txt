"Yes. I can give up their bread, not needing it at all, and go
away into the forest and live there on the mushrooms or the
berries, but they can't give up their bread here, wherefore they
are in bondage to the devil. Nowadays the unclean deny that there
is need of such fasting. Haughty and unclean is their
judgment."

"Och, true," sighed the monk.

"And have you seen devils among them?" asked Ferapont.

"Among them? Among whom?" asked the monk, timidly.

"I went to the Father Superior on Trinity Sunday last year, I
haven't been since. I saw a devil sitting on one man's chest hiding
under his cassock, only his horns poked out; another had one
peeping out of his pocket with such sharp eyes, he was afraid of
me; another settled in the unclean belly of one, another was
hanging round a man's neck, and so he was carrying him about
without seeing him."

"You- can see spirits?" the monk inquired.

"I tell you I can see, I can see through them. When I was coming
out from the Superior's I saw one hiding from me behind the door,
and a big one, a yard and a half or more high, with a thick long
grey tail, and the tip of his tail was in the crack of the door and
I was quick and slammed the door, pinching his tail in it. He
squealed and began to struggle, and I made the sign of the cross
over him three times. And he died on the spot like a crushed
spider. He must have rotted there in the corner and be stinking,
but they don't see, they don't smell it. It's a year since I have
been there. I reveal it to you, as you are a stranger."

"Your words are terrible! But, holy and blessed father," said
the monk, growing bolder and bolder, "is it true, as they noise
abroad even to distant lands about you, that you are in continual
communication with the Holy Ghost?"

"He does fly down at times."

"How does he fly down? In what form?"
