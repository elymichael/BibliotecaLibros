"Speak!" cried Ivan, "I want above everything to know what you
thought then. I want the truth, the truth!"

He drew a deep breath, looking angrily at Alyosha before his
answer came.

"Forgive me, I did think that, too, at the time," whispered
Alyosha, and he did not add one softening phrase.

"Thanks," snapped Ivan, and, leaving Alyosha, he went quickly on
his way. From that time Alyosha noticed that Ivan began obviously
to avoid him and seemed even to have taken a dislike to him, so
much so that Alyosha gave up going to see him. Immediately after
that meeting with him, Ivan had not gone home, but went straight to
Smerdyakov again.
