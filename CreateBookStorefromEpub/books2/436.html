<br/>"Come, I say, for my own amusement! You don't play horses, do<br/>you?"<br/><br/>"But you must look at it like this," said Alyosha, smiling.<br/>"Grown-up people go to the theatre and there the adventures of all<br/>sorts of heroes are represented- sometimes there are robbers and<br/>battles, too- and isn't that just the same thing, in a different<br/>form, of course? And young people's games of soldiers or robbers in<br/>their playtime are also art in its first stage. You know, they<br/>spring from the growing artistic instincts of the young. And<br/>sometimes these games are much better than performances in the<br/>theatre; the only difference is that people go there to look at the<br/>actors, while in these games the young people are the actors<br/>themselves. But that's only natural."<br/><br/>"You think so? Is that your idea?" Kolya looked at him intently.<br/>"Oh, you know, that's rather an interesting view. When I go home,<br/>I'll think it over. I'll admit I thought I might learn something<br/>from you. I've come to learn of you, Karamazov," Kolya concluded,<br/>in a voice full of spontaneous feeling.<br/><br/>"And I of you," said Alyosha, smiling and pressing his hand.<br/><br/>Kolya was much pleased with Alyosha. What struck him most was<br/>that he treated him exactly like an equal and that he talked to him<br/>just as if he were "quite grown up."<br/><br/>"I'll show you something directly, Karamazov; it's a theatrical<br/>performance, too," he said, laughing nervously. "That's why I've<br/>come."<br/><br/>"Let us go first to the people of the house, on the left. All<br/>the boys leave their coats in there, because the room is small and<br/>hot."<br/><br/>"Oh, I'm only coming in for a minute. I'll keep on my overcoat.<br/>Perezvon will stay here in the passage and be dead. Ici, Perezvon,<br/>lie down and be dead! You see how he's dead. I'll go in first and<br/>explore, then I'll whistle to him when I think fit, and you'll see,<br/>he'll dash in like mad. Only Smurov must not forget to open the<br/>door at the moment. I'll arrange it all and you'll see<br/>something."<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
