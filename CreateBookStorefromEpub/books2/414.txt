"I am in a difficulty, kids," Krassotkin began solemnly, "and
you must help me. Agafya must have broken her leg, since she has
not turned up till now, that's certain. I must go out. Will you let
me go?"

The children looked anxiously at one another. Their smiling
faces showed signs of uneasiness, but they did not yet fully grasp
what was expected of them.

"You won't be naughty while I am gone? You won't climb on the
cupboard and break your legs? You won't be frightened alone and
cry?"

A look of profound despondency came into the children's
faces.

"And I could show you something as a reward, a little copper
cannon which can be fired with real gunpowder."

The children's faces instantly brightened. "Show us the cannon,"
said Kostya, beaming all over.

Krassotkin put his hand in his satchel, and pulling out a little
bronze cannon stood it on the table.

"Ah, you are bound to ask that! Look, it's on wheels." He rolled
the toy on along the table. "And it can be fired off, too. It can
be loaded with shot and fired off."

"And it could kill anyone?"

"It can kill anyone; you've only got to aim at anybody," and
Krassotkin explained where the powder had to be put, where the shot
should be rolled in, showing a tiny hole like a touch-hole, and
told them that it kicked when it was fired.

The children listened with intense interest. What particularly
struck their imagination was that the cannon kicked.
