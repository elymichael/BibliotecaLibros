"Why? It's absurd to ask. Because I had condemned myself to die<br/>at five o'clock this morning, here, at dawn. I thought it made no<br/>difference whether I died a thief or a man of honour. But I see<br/>it's not so, it turns out that it does make a difference. Believe<br/>me, gentlemen, what has tortured me most during this night has not<br/>been the thought that I'd killed the old servant, and that I was in<br/>danger of Siberia just when my love was being rewarded, and Heaven<br/>was open to me again. Oh, that did torture me, but not in the same<br/>way; not so much as the damned consciousness that I had torn that<br/>damned money off my breast at last and spent it, and had become a<br/>downright thief! Oh, gentlemen, I tell you again, with a bleeding<br/>heart, I have learnt a great deal this night. I have learnt that<br/>it's not only impossible to live a scoundrel, but impossible to die<br/>a scoundrel… . No, gentlemen, one must die honest… "<br/><br/>Mitya was pale. His face had a haggard and exhausted look, in<br/>spite of his being intensely excited.<br/><br/>"I am beginning to understand you, Dmitri Fyodorovitch," the<br/>prosecutor said slowly, a soft and almost compassionate tone. "But<br/>all this, if you'll excuse my saying so, is a matter of nerves, in<br/>my opinion… your overwrought nerves, that's what it is. And why,<br/>for instance, should you not have saved yourself such misery for<br/>almost a month, by going and returning that fifteen hundred to the<br/>lady who had entrusted it to you? And why could you not have<br/>explained things to her, and in view of your position, which you<br/>describe as being so awful, why could you not have had recourse to<br/>the plan which would so naturally have occurred to one's mind, that<br/>is, after honourably confessing your errors to her, why could you<br/>not have asked her to lend you the sum needed for your expenses,<br/>which, with her generous heart, she would certainly not have<br/>refused you in your distress, especially if it had been with some<br/>guarantee, or even on the security you offered to the merchant<br/>Samsonov, and to Madame Hohlakov? I suppose you still regard that<br/>security as of value?"<br/><br/>Mitya suddenly crimsoned.<br/><br/>"Surely you don't think me such an out and out scoundrel as<br/>that? You can't be speaking in earnest?" he said, with indignation,<br/>looking the prosecutor straight in the face, and seeming unable to<br/>believe his ears.<br/><br/>"I assure you I'm in earnest… Why do you imagine I'm not<br/>serious?" It was the prosecutor's turn to be surprised.<br/><br/>"Oh, how base that would have been! Gentlemen, do you know, you<br/>are torturing me! Let me tell you everything, so be it. I'll<br/>confess all my infernal wickedness, but to put you to shame, and<br/>you'll be surprised yourselves at the depth of ignominy to which a<br/>medley of human passions can sink. You must know that I already had<br/>that plan myself, that plan you spoke of, just now, prosecutor!<br/>Yes, gentlemen, I, too, have had that thought in my mind all this<br/>current month, so that I was on the point of deciding to go to<br/>Katya- I was mean enough for that. But to go to her, to tell her of<br/>my treachery, and for that very treachery, to carry it out, for the<br/>expenses of that treachery, to beg for money from her, Katya (to<br/>beg, do you hear, to beg), and go straight from her to run away<br/>with the other, the rival, who hated and insulted her- to think of<br/>it! You must be mad, prosecutor!"<br/><br/>"Mad I am not, but I did speak in haste, without thinking… of<br/>that feminine jealousy… if there could be jealousy in this case, as<br/>you assert… yes, perhaps there is something of the kind," said the<br/>prosecutor, smiling.<br/><br/>"But that would have been so infamous!" Mitya brought his fist<br/>down on the table fiercely. "That would have been filthy beyond<br/>everything! Yes, do you know that she might have given me that<br/>money, yes, and she would have given it, too; she'd have been<br/>certain to give it, to be revenged on me, she'd have given it to<br/>satisfy her vengeance, to show her contempt for me, for hers is an<br/>infernal nature, too, and she's a woman of great wrath. I'd have<br/>taken the money, too, oh, I should have taken it; I should have<br/>taken it, and then, for the rest of my life… oh, God! Forgive me,<br/>gentlemen, I'm making such an outcry because I've had that thought<br/>in my mind so lately, only the day before yesterday, that night<br/>when I was having all that bother with Lyagavy, and afterwards<br/>yesterday, all day yesterday, I remember, till that happened… "<br/><br/>"Till what happened?" put in Nikolay Parfenovitch inquisitively,<br/>but Mitya did not hear it.<br/><br/>"I have made you an awful confession," Mitya said gloomily in<br/>conclusion. "You must appreciate it, and what's more, you must<br/>respect it, for if not, if that leaves your souls untouched, then<br/>you've simply no respect for me, gentlemen, I tell you that, and I<br/>shall die of shame at having confessed it to men like you! Oh, I<br/>shall shoot myself! Yes, I see, I see already that you don't<br/>believe me. What, you want to write that down, too?" he cried in<br/>dismay.<br/>
