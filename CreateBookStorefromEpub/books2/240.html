<br/>"Much you know about balls."<br/><br/>"And do you know much about them?"<br/><br/>"I have seen a ball. The year before last, Kuzma Kuzmitch's son<br/>was married and I looked on from the gallery. Do you suppose I want<br/>to be talking to you, Rakitin, while a prince like this is standing<br/>here. Such a visitor! Alyosha, my dear boy, I gaze at you and can't<br/>believe my eyes. Good heavens, can you have come here to see me! To<br/>tell you the truth, I never had a thought of seeing you and I<br/>didn't think that you would ever come and see me. Though this is<br/>not the moment now, I am awfully glad to see you. Sit down on the<br/>sofa, here, that's right, my bright young moon. I really can't take<br/>it in even now… . Eh, Rakitin, if only you had brought him<br/>yesterday or the day before! But I am glad as it is! Perhaps it's<br/>better he has come now, at such a moment, and not the day before<br/>yesterday."<br/><br/>She gaily sat down beside Alyosha on the sofa, looking at him<br/>with positive delight. And she really was glad, she was not lying<br/>when she said so. Her eyes glowed, her lips laughed, but it was a<br/>good-hearted merry laugh. Alyosha had not expected to see such a<br/>kind expression in her face… . He had hardly met her till the day<br/>before, he had formed an alarming idea of her, and had been<br/>horribly distressed the day before by the spiteful and treacherous<br/>trick she had played on Katerina Ivanovna. He was greatly surprised<br/>to find her now altogether different from what he had expected.<br/>And, crushed as he was by his own sorrow, his eyes involuntarily<br/>rested on her with attention. Her whole manner seemed changed for<br/>the better since yesterday, there was scarcely any trace of that<br/>mawkish sweetness in her speech, of that voluptuous softness in her<br/>movements. Everything was simple and good-natured, her gestures<br/>were rapid, direct, confiding, but she was greatly excited.<br/><br/>"Dear me, how everything comes together to-day!" she chattered<br/>on again. "And why I am so glad to see you, Alyosha, I couldn't say<br/>myself! If you ask me, I couldn't tell you."<br/><br/>"Come, don't you know why you're glad?" said Rakitin, grinning.<br/>"You used to be always pestering me to bring him, you'd some<br/>object, I suppose."<br/><br/>"I had a different object once, but now that's over, this is not<br/>the moment. I say, I want you to have something nice. I am so<br/>good-natured now. You sit down, too, Rakitin; why are you standing?<br/>You've sat down already? There's no fear of Rakitin's forgetting to<br/>look after himself. Look, Alyosha, he's sitting there opposite us,<br/>so offended that I didn't ask him to sit down before you. Ugh,<br/>Rakitin is such a one to take offence!" laughed Grushenka. "Don't<br/>be angry, Rakitin, I'm kind to-day. Why are you so depressed,<br/>Alyosha? Are you afraid of me?" She peeped into his eyes with merry<br/>mockery.<br/><br/>"He's sad. The promotion has not been given," boomed<br/>Rakitin.<br/><br/>"His elder stinks."<br/><br/>"What? You are talking some nonsense, you want to say something<br/>nasty. Be quiet, you stupid! Let me sit on your knee, Alyosha, like<br/>this." She suddenly skipped forward and jumped, laughing, on his<br/>knee, like a nestling kitten, with her right arm about his neck.<br/>"I'll cheer you up, my pious boy. Yes, really, will you let me sit<br/>on your knee? You won't be angry? If you tell me, I'll get<br/>off?"<br/><br/>
