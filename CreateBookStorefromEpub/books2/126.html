"How cross you are! It's because of yesterday; you had better<br/>lie down," said Alyosha.<br/><br/>"There! you say that," the old man observed suddenly, as though<br/>it had struck him for the first time, "and I am not angry with you.<br/>But if Ivan said it, I should be angry with him. It is only with<br/>you I have good moments, else you know I am an ill-natured<br/>man."<br/><br/>"You are not ill-natured, but distorted," said Alyosha with a<br/>smile.<br/><br/>"Listen. I meant this morning to get that ruffian Mitya locked<br/>up and I don't know now what I shall decide about it. Of course in<br/>these fashionable days fathers and mothers are looked upon as a<br/>prejudice, but even now the law does not allow you to drag your old<br/>father about by the hair, to kick him in the face in his own house,<br/>and brag of murdering him outright- all in the presence of<br/>witnesses. If I liked, I could crush him and could have him locked<br/>up at once for what he did yesterday."<br/><br/>"Then you don't mean to take proceedings?"<br/><br/>"Ivan has dissuaded me. I shouldn't care about Ivan, but there's<br/>another thing."<br/><br/>And bending down to Alyosha, he went on in a confidential<br/>half-whisper.<br/><br/>"If I send the ruffian to prison, she'll hear of it and run to<br/>see him at once. But if she hears that he has beaten me, a weak old<br/>man, within an inch of my life, she may give him up and come to meâ€¦<br/>For that's her way, everything by contraries. I know her through<br/>and through! Won't you have a drop of brandy? Take some cold coffee<br/>and I'll pour a quarter of a glass of brandy into it, it's<br/>delicious, my boy."<br/><br/>"No, thank you. I'll take that roll with me if I may," said<br/>Alyosha, and taking a halfpenny French roll he put it in the pocket<br/>of his cassock. "And you'd better not have brandy, either," he<br/>suggested apprehensively, looking into the old man's face.<br/><br/>"You are quite right, it irritates my nerves instead of soothing<br/>them. Only one little glass. I'll get it out of the cupboard."<br/><br/>He unlocked the cupboard, poured out a glass, drank it, then<br/>locked the cupboard and put the key back in his pocket.<br/>
