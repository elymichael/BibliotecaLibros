"Cards?"<br/><br/>"So, maybe they're not in bed if they're at cards. It's most<br/>likely not more than eleven."<br/><br/>"Quicker, Andrey! Quicker!" Mitya cried again, nervously.<br/><br/>"May I ask you something, sir?" said Andrey, after a pause.<br/>"Only I'm afraid of angering you, sir."<br/><br/>"What is it?"<br/><br/>"Why, Fenya threw herself at your feet just now, and begged you<br/>not to harm her mistress, and someone else, too… so you see, sir-<br/>It's I am taking you there… forgive me, sir, it's my conscience…<br/>maybe it's stupid of me to speak of it-."<br/><br/>Mitya suddenly seized him by the shoulders from behind.<br/><br/>"Are you a driver?" he asked frantically.<br/><br/>"Yes sir."<br/><br/>"Then you know that one has to make way. What would you say to a<br/>driver who wouldn't make way for anyone, but would just drive on<br/>and crush people? No, a driver mustn't run over people. One can't<br/>run over a man. One can't spoil people's lives. And if you have<br/>spoilt a life- punish yourself… . If only you've spoilt, if only<br/>you've ruined anyone's life- punish yourself and go away."<br/><br/>These phrases burst from Mitya almost hysterically. Though<br/>Andrey was surprised at him, he kept up the conversation.<br/>
