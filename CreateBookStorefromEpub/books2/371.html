"I simply didn't notice. You're quite right there, prosecutor,"<br/>Mitya assented suddenly.<br/><br/>Next came the account of Mitya's sudden determination to "step<br/>aside" and make way for their happiness. But he could not make up<br/>his mind to open his heart to them as before, and tell them about<br/>"the queen of his soul." He disliked speaking of her before these<br/>chilly persons "who were fastening on him like bugs." And so in<br/>response to their reiterated questions he answered briefly and<br/>abruptly:<br/><br/>"Well, I made up my mind to kill myself. What had I left to live<br/>for? That question stared me in the face. Her first rightful lover<br/>had come back, the man who wronged her but who'd hurried back to<br/>offer his love, after five years, and atone for the wrong with<br/>marriage… . So I knew it was all over for me… . And behind me<br/>disgrace, and that blood- Grigory's… . What had I to live for? So I<br/>went to redeem the pistols I had pledged, to load them and put a<br/>bullet in my brain to-morrow."<br/><br/>"And a grand feast the night before?"<br/><br/>"Yes, a grand feast the night before. Damn it all, gentlemen! Do<br/>make haste and finish it. I meant to shoot myself not far from<br/>here, beyond the village, and I'd planned to do it at five o'clock<br/>in the morning. And I had a note in my pocket already. I wrote it<br/>at Perhotin's when I loaded my pistols. Here's the letter. Read it!<br/>It's not for you I tell it," he added contemptuously. He took it<br/>from his waistcoat pocket and flung it on the table. The lawyers<br/>read it with curiosity, and, as is usual, added it to the papers<br/>connected with the case.<br/><br/>"And you didn't even think of washing your hands at Perhotin's?<br/>You were not afraid then of arousing suspicion?"<br/><br/>"What suspicion? Suspicion or not, I should have galloped here<br/>just the same, and shot myself at five o'clock, and you wouldn't<br/>have been in time to do anything. If it hadn't been for what's<br/>happened to my father, you would have known nothing about it, and<br/>wouldn't have come here. Oh, it's the devil's doing. It was the<br/>devil murdered father, it was through the devil that you found it<br/>out so soon. How did you manage to get here so quick? It's<br/>marvellous, a dream!"<br/><br/>"Mr. Perhotin informed us that when you came to him, you held in<br/>your hands… your blood-stained hands… your money… a lot of money… a<br/>bundle of hundred-rouble notes, and that his servant-boy saw it<br/>too."<br/><br/>"That's true, gentlemen. I remember it was so."<br/><br/>"Now, there's one little point presents itself. Can you inform<br/>us," Nikolay Parfenovitch began, with extreme gentleness, "where<br/>did you get so much money all of a sudden, when it appears from the<br/>facts, from the reckoning of time, that you had not been home?"<br/><br/>The prosecutor's brows contracted at the question being asked so<br/>plainly, but he did not interrupt Nikolay Parfenovitch.<br/>
