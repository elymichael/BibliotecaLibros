"If you'd been a cadet in the army, or a young hussar, you
wouldn't have talked like that, but would have drawn your sabre to
defend all Russia."

"I don't want to be a hussar, Marya Kondratyevna, and, what's
more, I should like to abolish all soldiers."

"And when an enemy comes, who is going to defend us?"

"There's no need of defence. In 1812 there was a great invasion
of Russia by Napoleon, first Emperor of the French, father of the
present one, and it would have been a good thing if they had
conquered us. A clever nation would have conquered a very stupid
one and annexed it. We should have had quite different
institutions."

"Are they so much better in their own country than we are? I
wouldn't change a dandy I know of for three young englishmen,"
observed Marya Kondratyevna tenderly, doubtless accompanying her
words with a most languishing glance.

"That's as one prefers."

"But you are just like a foreigner- just like a most gentlemanly
foreigner. I tell you that, though it makes me bashful."

"If you care to know, the folks there and ours here are just
alike in their vice. They are swindlers, only there the scoundrel
wears polished boots and here he grovels in filth and sees no harm
in it. The Russian people want thrashing, as Fyodor Pavlovitch said
very truly yesterday, though he is mad, and all his children."

"You said yourself you had such a respect for Ivan
Fyodorovitch."

"But he said I was a stinking lackey. He thinks that I might be
unruly. He is mistaken there. If I had a certain sum in my pocket,
I would have left here long ago. Dmitri Fyodorovitch is lower than
any lackey in his behaviour, in his mind, and in his poverty. He
doesn't know how to do anything, and yet he is respected by
everyone. I may be only a soup-maker, but with luck I could open a
cafe restaurant in Petrovka, in Moscow, for my cookery is something
special, and there's no one in Moscow, except the foreigners, whose
cookery is anything special. Dmitri Fyodorovitch is a beggar, but
if he were to challenge the son of the first count in the country,
he'd fight him. Though in what way is he better than I am? For he
is ever so much stupider than I am. Look at the money he has wasted
without any need!"
