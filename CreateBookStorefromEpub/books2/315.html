<br/>"No, in the Province of Smolensk. Only, a Uhlan had brought her<br/>to Russia before that, my future wife, with her mamma and her aunt,<br/>and another female relation with a grown-up son. He brought her<br/>straight from Poland and gave her up to me. He was a lieutenant in<br/>our regiment, a very nice young man. At first he meant to marry her<br/>himself. But he didn't marry her, because she turned out to be<br/>lame."<br/><br/>"So you married a lame woman?" cried Kalganov.<br/><br/>"Yes. They both deceived me a little bit at the time, and<br/>concealed it. I thought she was hopping; she kept hoppingâ€¦ . I<br/>thought it was for fun."<br/><br/>"So pleased she was going to marry you!" yelled Kalganov, in a<br/>ringing, childish voice.<br/><br/>"Yes, so pleased. But it turned out to be quite a different<br/>cause. Afterwards, when we were married, after the wedding, that<br/>very evening, she confessed, and very touchingly asked forgiveness.<br/>'I once jumped over a puddle when I was a child,' she said, 'and<br/>injured my leg.' He he!"<br/><br/>Kalgonov went off into the most childish laughter, almost<br/>falling on the sofa. Grushenka, too, laughed. Mitya was at the<br/>pinnacle of happiness.<br/><br/>"Do you know, that's the truth, he's not lying now," exclaimed<br/>Kalganov, turning to Mitya; "and do you know, he's been married<br/>twice; it's his first wife he's talking about. But his second wife,<br/>do you know, ran away, and is alive now."<br/><br/>"Is it possible?" said Mitya, turning quickly to Maximov with an<br/>expression of the utmost astonishment.<br/><br/>"Yes. She did run away. I've had that unpleasant experience,"<br/>Maximov modestly assented, "with a monsieur. And what was worse,<br/>she'd had all my little property transferred to her beforehand.<br/>'You're an educated man,' she said to me. 'You can always get your<br/>living.' She settled my business with that. A venerable bishop once<br/>said to me: 'One of your wives was lame, but the other was too<br/>light-footed.' He he!<br/><br/>"Listen, listen!" cried Kalganov, bubbling over, "if he's<br/>telling lies- and he often is- he's only doing it to amuse us all.<br/>There's no harm in that, is there? You know, I sometimes like him.<br/>He's awfully low, but it's natural to him, eh? Don't you think so?<br/>Some people are low from self-interest, but he's simply so, from<br/>nature. Only fancy, he claims (he was arguing about it all the way<br/>yesterday) that Gogol wrote Dead Souls about him. Do you remember,<br/>there's a landowner called Maximov in it, whom Nozdryov thrashed.<br/>He was charged, do you remember, 'for inflicting bodily injury with<br/>rods on the landowner Maximov in a drunken condition.' Would you<br/>believe it, he claims that he was that Maximov and that he was<br/>beaten! Now can it be so? Tchitchikov made his journey, at the very<br/>latest, at the beginning of the twenties, so that the dates don't<br/>fit. He couldn't have been thrashed then, he couldn't, could<br/>he?"<br/><br/>
