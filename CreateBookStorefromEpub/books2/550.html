<br/>"Dmitri Fyodorovitch told me so himself; you can believe him.<br/>The woman who came between us has ruined him; she is the cause of<br/>it all, let me tell you," Grushenka added. She seemed to be<br/>quivering with hatred, and there was a vindictive note in her<br/>voice.<br/><br/>She was again asked to whom she was referring.<br/><br/>"The young lady, Katerina Ivanovna there. She sent for me,<br/>offered me chocolate, tried to fascinate me. There's not much true<br/>shame about her, I can tell you thatâ€¦ "<br/><br/>At this point the President checked her sternly, begging her to<br/>moderate her language. But the jealous woman's heart was burning,<br/>and she did not care what she did.<br/><br/>"When the prisoner was arrested at Mokroe," the prosecutor<br/>asked, "everyone saw and heard you run out of the next room and cry<br/>out: 'It's all my fault. We'll go to Siberia together!' So you<br/>already believed him to have murdered his father?"<br/><br/>"I don't remember what I felt at the time," answered Grushenka.<br/>"Everyone was crying out that he had killed his father, and I felt<br/>that it was my fault, that it was on my account he had murdered<br/>him. But when he said he wasn't guilty, I believed him at once, and<br/>I believe him now and always shall believe him. He is not the man<br/>to tell a lie."<br/><br/>Fetyukovitch began his cross-examination. I remember that among<br/>other things he asked about Rakitin and the twenty-five roubles<br/>"you paid him for bringing Alexey Fyodorovitch Karamazov to see<br/>you."<br/><br/>"There was nothing strange about his taking the money," sneered<br/>Grushenka, with angry contempt. "He was always coming to me for<br/>money: he used to get thirty roubles a month at least out of me,<br/>chiefly for luxuries: he had enough to keep him without my<br/>help."<br/><br/>"What led you to be so liberal to Mr. Rakitin?" Fetyukovitch<br/>asked, in spite of an uneasy movement on the part of the<br/>President.<br/><br/>"Why, he is my cousin. His mother was my mother's sister. But<br/>he's always besought me not to tell anyone here of it, he is so<br/>dreadfully ashamed of me."<br/><br/>
