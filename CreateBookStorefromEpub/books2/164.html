"And now on the top of it all, my friend, the best man in the<br/>world is going, is leaving the earth! If you knew, Lise, how bound<br/>up in soul I am with him! And then I shall be left alone… . I shall<br/>come to you, Lise… . For the future we will be together."<br/><br/>"Yes, together, together! Henceforward we shall be always<br/>together, all our lives! Listen, kiss me, I allow you."<br/><br/>Alyosha kissed her.<br/><br/>"Come, now go. Christ be with you!" and she made the sign of the<br/>cross over him. "Make haste back to him while he is alive. I see<br/>I've kept you cruelly. I'll pray to-day for him and you. Alyosha,<br/>we shall be happy! Shall we be happy, shall we?"<br/><br/>"I believe we shall, Lise."<br/><br/>Alyosha thought it better not to go in to Madame Hohlakov and<br/>was going out of the house without saying good-bye to her. But no<br/>sooner had he opened the door than he found Madame Hohlakov<br/>standing before him. From the first word Alyosha guessed that she<br/>had been waiting on purpose to meet him.<br/><br/>"Alexey Fyodorovitch, this is awful. This is all childish<br/>nonsense and ridiculous. I trust you won't dream- It's foolishness,<br/>nothing but foolishness!" she said, attacking him at once.<br/><br/>"Only don't tell her that," said Alyosha, "or she will be upset,<br/>and that's bad for her now."<br/><br/>"Sensible advice from a sensible young man. Am I to understand<br/>that you only agreed with her from compassion for her invalid<br/>state, because you didn't want to irritate her by<br/>contradiction?"<br/><br/>"Oh no, not at all. I was quite serious in what I said," Alyosha<br/>declared stoutly.<br/><br/>"To be serious about it is impossible, unthinkable, and in the<br/>first place I shall never be at home to you again, and I shall take<br/>her away, you may be sure of that."<br/>
