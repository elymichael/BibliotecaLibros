<br/>"You have some special communication to make?" the President<br/>went on, still mistrustfully.<br/><br/>Ivan looked down, waited a few seconds and, raising his head,<br/>answered, almost stammering:<br/><br/>"No… I haven't. I have nothing particular."<br/><br/>They began asking him questions. He answered, as it were,<br/>reluctantly, with extreme brevity, with a sort of disgust which<br/>grew more and more marked, though he answered rationally. To many<br/>questions he answered that he did not know. He knew nothing of his<br/>father's money relations with Dmitri. "I wasn't interested in the<br/>subject," he added. Threats to murder his father he had heard from<br/>the prisoner. Of the money in the envelope he had heard from<br/>Smerdyakov.<br/><br/>"The same thing over and over again," he interrupted suddenly,<br/>with a look of weariness. "I have nothing particular to tell the<br/>court."<br/><br/>"I see you are unwell and understand your feelings," the<br/>President began.<br/><br/>He turned to the prosecutor and the counsel for the defence to<br/>invite them to examine the witness, if necessary, when Ivan<br/>suddenly asked in an exhausted voice:<br/><br/>"Let me go, your excellency, I feel very ill."<br/><br/>And with these words, without waiting for permission, he turned<br/>to walk out of the court. But after taking four steps he stood<br/>still, as though he had reached a decision, smiled slowly, and went<br/>back.<br/><br/>"I am like the peasant girl, your excellency… you know. How does<br/>it go? 'I'll stand up if I like, and I won't if I don't.' They were<br/>trying to put on her sarafan to take her to church to be married,<br/>and she said, 'I'll stand up if I like, and I won't if I don't.'…<br/>It's in some book about the peasantry."<br/><br/>
