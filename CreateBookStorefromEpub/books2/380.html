<br/>"Here are clothes for you," he observed airily, seeming well<br/>satisfied with the success of his mission. "Mr. Kalganov has kindly<br/>provided these for this unusual emergency, as well as a clean<br/>shirt. Luckily he had them all in his trunk. You can keep your own<br/>socks and underclothes."<br/><br/>Mitya flew into a passion.<br/><br/>"I won't have other people's clothes!" he shouted menacingly,<br/>"give me my own!"<br/><br/>"It's impossible!"<br/><br/>"Give me my own. Damn Kalganov and his clothes, too!"<br/><br/>It was a long time before they could persuade him. But they<br/>succeeded somehow in quieting him down. They impressed upon him<br/>that his clothes, being stained with blood, must be "included with<br/>the other material evidence," and that they "had not even the right<br/>to let him have them now… taking into consideration the possible<br/>outcome of the case." Mitya at last understood this. He subsided<br/>into gloomy silence and hurriedly dressed himself. He merely<br/>observed, as he put them on, that the clothes were much better than<br/>his old ones, and that he disliked "gaining by the change." The<br/>coat was, besides, "ridiculously tight. Am I to be dressed up like<br/>a fool… for your amusement?"<br/><br/>They urged upon him again that he was exaggerating, that<br/>Kalganov was only a little taller, so that only the trousers might<br/>be a little too long. But the coat turned out to be really tight in<br/>the shoulders.<br/><br/>"Damn it all! I can hardly button it," Mitya grumbled. "Be so<br/>good as to tell Mr. Kalganov from me that I didn't ask for his<br/>clothes, and it's not my doing that they've dressed me up like a<br/>clown."<br/><br/>"He understands that, and is sorry… I mean, not sorry to lend<br/>you his clothes, but sorry about all this business," mumbled<br/>Nikolay Parfenovitch.<br/><br/>"Confound his sorrow! Well, where now? Am I to go on sitting<br/>here?"<br/><br/>
