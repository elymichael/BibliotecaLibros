those who are married."

Kostya stared at Nastya and listened, pondering profoundly.

"Nastya, how silly you are!" he said at last, firmly and calmly.
"How can Katerina have a baby when she isn't married?"

Nastya was exasperated.

"You know nothing about it," she snapped irritably. "Perhaps she
has a husband, only he is in prison, so now she's got a baby."

"But is her husband in prison?" the matter-of-fact Kostya
inquired gravely.

"Or, I tell you what," Nastya interrupted impulsively,
completely rejecting and forgetting her first hypothesis. "She
hasn't a husband, you are right there, but she wants to be married,
and so she's been thinking of getting married, and thinking and
thinking of it till now she's got it, that is, not a husband but a
baby."

"Well, perhaps so," Kostya agreed, entirely vanquished. "But you
didn't say so before. So how could I tell?"

"Come, kiddies," said Kolya, stepping into the room. "You're
terrible people, I see."

"And Perezvon with you!" grinned Kostya, and began snapping his
fingers and calling Perezvon.
