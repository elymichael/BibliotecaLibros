<br/>"Karamazov," cried Kolya, "can it be true what's taught us in<br/>religion, that we shall all rise again from the dead and shall live<br/>and see each other again, all, Ilusha too?"<br/><br/>"Certainly we shall all rise again, certainly we shall see each<br/>other and shall tell each other with joy and gladness all that has<br/>happened!" Alyosha answered, half laughing, half enthusiastic.<br/><br/>"Ah, how splendid it will be!" broke from Kolya.<br/><br/>"Well, now we will finish talking and go to his funeral dinner.<br/>Don't be put out at our eating pancakes- it's a very old custom and<br/>there's something nice in that!" laughed Alyosha. "Well, let us go!<br/>And now we go hand in hand."<br/><br/>"And always so, all our lives hand in hand! Hurrah for<br/>Karamazov!" Kolya cried once more rapturously, and once more the<br/>boys took up his exclamation:<br/><br/>"Hurrah for Karamazov!"<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
