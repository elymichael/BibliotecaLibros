<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>1<br/>The Fatal Day<br/><br/><br/>AT ten o'clock in the morning of the day following the events I<br/>have described, the trial of Dmitri Karamazov began in our district<br/>court.<br/><br/>I hasten to emphasise the fact that I am far from esteeming<br/>myself capable of reporting all that took place at the trial in<br/>full detail, or even in the actual order of events. I imagine that<br/>to mention everything with full explanation would fill a volume,<br/>even a very large one. And so I trust I may not be reproached, for<br/>confining myself to what struck me. I may have selected as of most<br/>interest what was of secondary importance, and may have omitted the<br/>most prominent and essential details. But I see I shall do better<br/>not to apologise. I will do my best and the reader will see for<br/>himself that I have done all I can.<br/><br/>And, to begin with, before entering the court, I will mention<br/>what surprised me most on that day. Indeed, as it appeared later,<br/>everyone was surprised at it, too. We all knew that the affair had<br/>aroused great interest, that everyone was burning with impatience<br/>for the trial to begin, that it had been a subject of talk,<br/>conjecture, exclamation and surmise for the last two months in<br/>local society. Everyone knew, too, that the case had become known<br/>throughout Russia, but yet we had not imagined that it had aroused<br/>such burning, such intense, interest in everyone, not only among<br/>ourselves, but all over Russia. This became evident at the trial<br/>this day.<br/><br/>Visitors had arrived not only from the chief town of our<br/>province, but from several other Russian towns, as well as from<br/>Moscow and Petersburg. Among them were lawyers, ladies, and even<br/>several distinguished personages. Every ticket of admission had<br/>been snatched up. A special place behind the table at which the<br/>three judges sat was set apart for the most distinguished and<br/>important of the men visitors; a row of arm-chairs had been placed<br/>there- something exceptional, which had never been allowed before.<br/>A large proportion not less than half of the public- were ladies.<br/>There was such a large number of lawyers from all parts that they<br/>did not know where to seat them, for every ticket had long since<br/>been eagerly sought for and distributed. I saw at the end of the<br/>room, behind the platform, a special partition hurriedly put up,<br/>behind which all these lawyers were admitted, and they thought<br/>themselves lucky to have standing room there, for all chairs had<br/>been removed for the sake of space, and the crowd behind the<br/>partition stood throughout the case closely packed, shoulder to<br/>shoulder.<br/><br/>Some of the ladies, especially those who came from a distance,<br/>made their appearance in the gallery very smartly dressed, but the<br/>majority of the ladies were oblivious even of dress. Their faces<br/>betrayed hysterical, intense, almost morbid, curiosity. A peculiar<br/>fact- established afterwards by many observations- was that almost<br/>all the ladies, or, at least the vast majority of them, were on<br/>Mitya's side and in favour of his being acquitted. This was perhaps<br/>chiefly owing to his reputation as a conqueror of female hearts. It<br/>was known that two women rivals were to appear in the case. One of<br/>them- Katerina Ivanovna- was an object of general interest. All<br/>sorts of extraordinary tales were told about her, amazing anecdotes<br/>of her passion for Mitya, in spite of his crime. Her pride and<br/>"aristocratic connections" were particularly insisted upon (she had<br/>called upon scarcely anyone in the town). People said she intended<br/>to petition the Government for leave to accompany the criminal to<br/>Siberia and to be married to him somewhere in the mines. The<br/>appearance of Grushenka in court was awaited with no less<br/>impatience. The public was looking forward with anxious curiosity<br/>to the meeting of the two rivals- the proud aristocratic girl and<br/>"the hetaira." But Grushenka was a more familiar figure to the<br/>ladies of the district than Katerina Ivanovna. They had already<br/>seen "the woman who had ruined Fyodor Pavlovitch and his unhappy<br/>son," and all, almost without exception, wondered how father and<br/>son could be so in love with "such a very common, ordinary Russian<br/>girl, who was not even pretty."<br/><br/>In brief, there was a great deal of talk. I know for a fact that<br/>there were several serious family quarrels on Mitya's account in<br/>our town. Many ladies quarrelled violently with their husbands over<br/>differences of opinion about the dreadful case, and it was that the<br/>husbands of these ladies, far from being favourably disposed to the<br/>prisoner, should enter the court bitterly prejudiced against him.<br/>In fact, one may say pretty certainly that the masculine, as<br/>distinguished from the feminine, part of the audience was biased<br/>against the prisoner. There were numbers of severe, frowning, even<br/>vindictive faces. Mitya, indeed, had managed to offend many people<br/>during his stay in the town. Some of the visitors were, of course,<br/>in excellent spirits and quite unconcerned as to the fate of Mitya<br/>personally. But all were interested in the trial, and the majority<br/>of the men were certainly hoping for the conviction of the<br/>criminal, except perhaps the lawyers, who were more interested in<br/>the legal than in the moral aspect of the case.<br/><br/>Everybody was excited at the presence of the celebrated lawyer,<br/>Fetyukovitch. His talent was well known, and this was not the first<br/>time he had defended notorious criminal cases in the provinces. And<br/>if he defended them, such cases became celebrated and long<br/>remembered all over Russia. There were stories, too, about our<br/>prosecutor and about the President of the Court. It was said that<br/>Ippolit Kirillovitch was in a tremor at meeting Fetyukovitch, and<br/>that they had been enemies from the beginning of their careers in<br/>Petersburg, that though our sensitive prosecutor, who always<br/>considered that he had been aggrieved by someone in Petersburg<br/>because his talents had not been properly appreciated, was keenly<br/>excited over the Karamazov case, and was even dreaming of<br/>rebuilding his flagging fortunes by means of it, Fetyukovitch, they<br/>said, was his one anxiety. But these rumours were not quite just.<br/>Our prosecutor was not one of those men who lose heart in face of<br/>danger. On the contrary, his self-confidence increased with the<br/>increase of danger. It must be noted that our prosecutor was in<br/>general too hasty and morbidly impressionable. He would put his<br/>whole soul into some case and work at it as though his whole fate<br/>and his whole fortune depended on its result. This was the subject<br/>of some ridicule in the legal world, for just by this<br/>characteristic our prosecutor had gained a wider notoriety than<br/>could have been expected from his modest position. People laughed<br/>particularly at his passion for psychology. In my opinion, they<br/>were wrong, and our prosecutor was, I believe, a character of<br/>greater depth than was generally supposed. But with his delicate<br/>health he had failed to make his mark at the outset of his career<br/>and had never made up for it later.<br/>
