<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>10<br/>The Speech for the Defence. An Argument that Cuts Both Ways<br/><br/><br/>ALL was hushed as the first words of the famous orator rang out.<br/>The eyes of the audience were fastened upon him. He began very<br/>simply and directly, with an air of conviction, but not the<br/>slightest trace of conceit. He made no attempt at eloquence, at<br/>pathos, or emotional phrases. He was like a man speaking in a<br/>circle of intimate and sympathetic friends. His voice was a fine<br/>one, sonorous and sympathetic, and there was something genuine and<br/>simple in the very sound of it. But everyone realised at once that<br/>the speaker might suddenly rise to genuine pathos and "pierce the<br/>heart with untold power." His language was perhaps more irregular<br/>than Ippolit Kirillovitch's, but he spoke without long phrases, and<br/>indeed, with more precision. One thing did not please the ladies:<br/>he kept bending forward, especially at the beginning of his speech,<br/>not exactly bowing, but as though he were about to dart at his<br/>listeners, bending his long spine in half, as though there were a<br/>spring in the middle that enabled him to bend almost at right<br/>angles.<br/><br/>At the beginning of his speech he spoke rather disconnectedly,<br/>without system, one may say, dealing with facts separately, though,<br/>at the end, these facts formed a whole. His speech might be divided<br/>into two parts, the first consisting of criticism in refutation of<br/>the charge, sometimes malicious and sarcastic. But in the second<br/>half he suddenly changed his tone, and even his manner, and at once<br/>rose to pathos. The audience seemed on the lookout for it, and<br/>quivered with enthusiasm.<br/><br/>He went straight to the point, and began by saying that although<br/>he practised in Petersburg, he had more than once visited<br/>provincial towns to defend prisoners, of whose innocence he had a<br/>conviction or at least a preconceived idea. "That is what has<br/>happened to me in the present case," he explained. "From the very<br/>first accounts in the newspapers I was struck by something which<br/>strongly prepossessed me in the prisoner's favour. What interested<br/>me most was a fact which often occurs in legal practice, but<br/>rarely, I think, in such an extreme and peculiar form as in the<br/>present case. I ought to formulate that peculiarity only at the end<br/>of my speech, but I will do so at the very beginning, for it is my<br/>weakness to go to work directly, not keeping my effects in reserve<br/>and economising my material. That may be imprudent on my part, but<br/>at least it's sincere. What I have in my mind is this: there is an<br/>overwhelming chain of evidence against the prisoner, and at the<br/>same time not one fact that will stand criticism, if it is examined<br/>separately. As I followed the case more closely in the papers my<br/>idea was more and more confirmed, and I suddenly received from the<br/>prisoner's relatives a request to undertake his defence. I at once<br/>hurried here, and here I became completely convinced. It was to<br/>break down this terrible chain of facts, and to show that each<br/>piece of evidence taken separately was unproved and fantastic, that<br/>I undertook the case."<br/><br/>So Fetyukovitch began.<br/><br/>"Gentlemen of the jury," he suddenly protested, "I am new to<br/>this district. I have no preconceived ideas. The prisoner, a man of<br/>turbulent and unbridled temper, has not insulted me. But he has<br/>insulted perhaps hundreds of persons in this town, and so<br/>prejudiced many people against him beforehand. Of course I<br/>recognise that the moral sentiment of local society is justly<br/>excited against him. The prisoner is of turbulent and violent<br/>temper. Yet he was received in society here; he was even welcome in<br/>the family of my talented friend, the prosecutor."<br/><br/>(N.B. At these words there were two or three laughs in the<br/>audience, quickly suppressed, but noticed by all. All of us knew<br/>that the prosecutor received Mitya against his will, solely because<br/>he had somehow interested his wife- a lady of the highest virtue<br/>and moral worth, but fanciful, capricious, and fond of opposing her<br/>husband, especially in trifles. Mitya's visits, however, had not<br/>been frequent.)<br/><br/>"Nevertheless I venture to suggest," Fetyukovitch continued,<br/>"that in spite of his independent mind and just character, my<br/>opponent may have formed a mistaken prejudice against my<br/>unfortunate client. Oh, that is so natural; the unfortunate man has<br/>only too well deserved such prejudice. Outraged morality, and still<br/>more outraged taste, is often relentless. We have, in the talented<br/>prosecutor's speech, heard a stern analysis of the prisoner's<br/>character and conduct, and his severe critical attitude to the case<br/>was evident. And, what's more, he went into psychological<br/>subtleties into which he could not have entered, if he had the<br/>least conscious and malicious prejudice against the prisoner. But<br/>there are things which are even worse, even more fatal in such<br/>cases, than the most malicious and consciously unfair attitude. It<br/>is worse if we are carried away by the artistic instinct, by the<br/>desire to create, so to speak, a romance, especially if God has<br/>endowed us with psychological insight. Before I started on my way<br/>here, I was warned in Petersburg, and was myself aware, that I<br/>should find here a talented opponent whose psychological insight<br/>and subtlety had gained him peculiar renown in legal circles of<br/>recent years. But profound as psychology is, it's a knife that cuts<br/>both ways." (Laughter among the public.) "You will, of course,<br/>forgive me my comparison; I can't boast of eloquence. But I will<br/>take as an example any point in the prosecutor's speech.<br/>
