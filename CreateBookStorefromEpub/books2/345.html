"Here's the note!" she turned quickly to Pyotr Ilyitch. "Go,<br/>save him. It's a noble deed on your part!"<br/><br/>And she made the sign of the cross three times over him. She ran<br/>out to accompany him to the passage.<br/><br/>"How grateful I am to you! You can't think how grateful I am to<br/>you for having come to me, first. How is it I haven't met you<br/>before? I shall feel flattered at seeing you at my house in the<br/>future. How delightful it is that you are living here!… Such<br/>precision! Such practical ability!… They must appreciate you, they<br/>must understand you. If there's anything I can do, believe me… oh,<br/>I love young people! I'm in love with young people! The younger<br/>generation are the one prop of our suffering country. Her one hope…<br/>. Oh, go, go!… "<br/><br/>But Pyotr Ilyitch had already run away or she would not have let<br/>him go so soon. Yet Madame Hohlakov had made a rather agreeable<br/>impression on him, which had somewhat softened his anxiety at being<br/>drawn into such an unpleasant affair. Tastes differ, as we all<br/>know. "She's by no means so elderly," he thought, feeling pleased,<br/>"on the contrary I should have taken her for her daughter."<br/><br/>As for Madame Hohlakov, she was simply enchanted by the young<br/>man. "Such sence such exactness! in so young a man! in our day! and<br/>all that with such manners and appearance! People say the young<br/>people of to-day are no good for anything, but here's an example!"<br/>etc. So she simply forgot this "dreadful affair," and it was only<br/>as she was getting into bed, that, suddenly recalling "how near<br/>death she had been," she exclaimed: "Ah, it is awful, awful!"<br/><br/>But she fell at once into a sound, sweet sleep.<br/><br/>I would not, however, have dwelt on such trivial and irrelevant<br/>details, if this eccentric meeting of the young official with the<br/>by no means elderly widow had not subsequently turned out to be the<br/>foundation of the whole career of that practical and precise young<br/>man. His story is remembered to this day with amazement in our<br/>town, and I shall perhaps have something to say about it, when I<br/>have finished my long history of the Brothers Karamazov.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
