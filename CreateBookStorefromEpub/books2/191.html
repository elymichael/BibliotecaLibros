<br/>"And why should he go to father, especially on the sly, if, as<br/>you say yourself, Agrafena Alexandrovna won't come at all?" Ivan<br/>went on, turning white with anger. "You say that yourself, and all<br/>the while I've been here, I've felt sure it was all the old man's<br/>fancy, and the creature won't come to him. Why should Dmitri break<br/>in on him if she doesn't come? Speak, I want to know what you are<br/>thinking!"<br/><br/>"You know yourself why he'll come. What's the use of what I<br/>think? His honour will come simply because he is in a rage or<br/>suspicious on account of my illness perhaps, and he'll dash in, as<br/>he did yesterday through impatience to search the rooms, to see<br/>whether she hasn't escaped him on the sly. He is perfectly well<br/>aware, too, that Fyodor Pavlovitch has a big envelope with three<br/>thousand roubles in it, tied up with ribbon and sealed with three<br/>seals. On it is written in his own hand 'To my angel Grushenka, if<br/>she will come,' to which he added three days later, 'for my little<br/>chicken.' There's no knowing what that might do."<br/><br/>"Nonsense!" cried Ivan, almost beside himself. "Dmitri won't<br/>come to steal money and kill my father to do it. He might have<br/>killed him yesterday on account of Grushenka, like the frantic,<br/>savage fool he is, but he won't steal."<br/><br/>"He is in very great need of money now- the greatest need, Ivan<br/>Fyodorovitch. You don't know in what need he is," Smerdyakov<br/>explained, with perfect composure and remarkable distinctness. "He<br/>looks on that three thousand as his own, too. He said so to me<br/>himself. 'My father still owes me just three thousand,' he said.<br/>And besides that, consider, Ivan Fyodorovitch, there is something<br/>else perfectly true. It's as good as certain, so to say, that<br/>Agrafena Alexandrovna will force him, if only she cares to, to<br/>marry her- the master himself, I mean, Fyodor Pavlovitch- if only<br/>she cares to, and of course she may care to. All I've said is that<br/>she won't come, but maybe she's looking for more than that- I mean<br/>to be mistress here. I know myself that Samsonov, her merchant, was<br/>laughing with her about it, telling her quite openly that it would<br/>not be at all a stupid thing to do. And she's got plenty of sense.<br/>She wouldn't marry a beggar like Dmitri Fyodorovitch. So, taking<br/>that into consideration, Ivan Fyodorovitch, reflect that then<br/>neither Dmitri Fyodorovitch nor yourself and your brother, Alexey<br/>Fyodorovitch, would have anything after the master's death, not a<br/>rouble, for Agrafena Alexandrovna would marry him simply to get<br/>hold of the whole, all the money there is. But if your father were<br/>to die now, there'd be some forty thousand for sure, even for<br/>Dmitri Fyodorovitch whom he hates so, for he's made no will… .<br/>Dmitri Fyodorovitch knows all that very well."<br/><br/>A sort of shudder passed over Ivan's face. He suddenly<br/>flushed.<br/><br/>"Then why on earth," he suddenly interrupted Smerdyakov, "do you<br/>advise me to go to Tchermashnya? What did you mean by that? If I go<br/>away, you see what will happen here." Ivan drew his breath with<br/>difficulty.<br/><br/>"Precisely so," said Smerdyakov, softly and reasonably, watching<br/>Ivan intently, however.<br/><br/>"What do you mean by 'precisely so'?" Ivan questioned him, with<br/>a menacing light in his eyes, restraining himself with<br/>difficulty.<br/><br/>"I spoke because I felt sorry for you. If I were in your place I<br/>should simply throw it all up… rather than stay on in such a<br/>position," answered Smerdyakov, with the most candid air looking at<br/>Ivan's flashing eyes. They were both silent.<br/><br/>"You seem to be a perfect idiot, and what's more… an awful<br/>scoundrel, too." Ivan rose suddenly from the bench. He was about to<br/>pass straight through the gate, but he stopped short and turned to<br/>Smerdyakov. Something strange followed. Ivan, in a sudden paroxysm,<br/>bit his lip, clenched his fists, and, in another minute, would have<br/>flung himself on Smerdyakov. The latter, anyway, noticed it at the<br/>same moment, started, and shrank back. But the moment passed<br/>without mischief to Smerdyakov, and Ivan turned in silence, as it<br/>seemed in perplexity, to the gate.<br/><br/>
