<br/>Grushenka leapt up from her place.<br/><br/>"Surely you don't want to go, Alyosha!" she cried, in mournful<br/>surprise. "What are you doing to me? You've stirred up my feeling,<br/>tortured me, and now you'll leave me to face this night alone!"<br/><br/>"He can hardly spend the night with you! Though if he wants to,<br/>let him! I'll go alone," Rakitin scoffed jeeringly.<br/><br/>"Hush, evil tongue!" Grushenka cried angrily at him; "you never<br/>said such words to me as he has come to say."<br/><br/>"What has he said to you so special?" asked Rakitin<br/>irritably.<br/><br/>"I can't say, I don't know. I don't know what he said to me, it<br/>went straight to my heart; he has wrung my heart… . He is the<br/>first, the only one who has pitied me, that's what it is. Why did<br/>you not come before, you angel?" She fell on her knees before him<br/>as though in a sudden frenzy.

I believed that, nasty as I am, someone would really<br/>love me, not only with a shameful love!"<br/><br/>"What have I done to you?" answered Alyosha, bending over her<br/>with a tender smile, and gently taking her by the hands; "I only<br/>gave you an onion, nothing but a tiny little onion, that was<br/>all!"<br/><br/>He was moved to tears himself as he said it. At that moment<br/>there was a sudden noise in the passage, someone came into the<br/>hall. Grushenka jumped up, seeming greatly alarmed. Fenya ran<br/>noisily into the room, crying out:<br/><br/>"Mistress, mistress darling, a messenger has galloped up," she<br/>cried, breathless and joyful. "A carriage from Mokroe for you,<br/>Timofey the driver, with three horses, they are just putting in<br/>fresh horses… . A letter, here's the letter, mistress."<br/><br/>A letter was in her hand and she waved it in the air all the<br/>while she talked. Grushenka snatched the letter from her and<br/>carried it to the candle. It was only a note, a few lines. She read<br/>it in one instant.<br/><br/>
