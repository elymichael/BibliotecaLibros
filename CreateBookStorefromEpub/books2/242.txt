"Yes, that's really true," Rakitin put in suddenly with genuine
surprise. "Alyosha, she is really afraid of a chicken like
you."

"He is a chicken to you, Rakitin… because you've no conscience,
that's what it is! You see, I love him with all my soul, that's how
it is! Alyosha, do you believe I love you with all my soul?"

"Ah, you shameless woman! She is making you a declaration,
Alexey!"

"Well, what of it, I love him!"

"And what about your officer? And the priceless message from
Mokroe?"

"That is quite different."

"That's a woman's way of looking at it!"

"Don't you make me angry, Rakitin." Grushenka caught him up
hotly. "This is quite different. I love Alyosha in a different way.
It's true, Alyosha, I had sly designs on you before. For I am a
horrid, violent creature. But at other times I've looked upon you,
Alyosha, as my conscience. I've kept thinking 'how anyone like that
must despise a nasty thing like me.' I thought that the day before
yesterday, as I ran home from the young lady's. I have thought of
you a long time in that way, Alyosha, and Mitya knows; I've talked
to him about it. Mitya understands. Would you believe it, I
sometimes look at you and feel ashamed, utterly ashamed of myself…
. And how, and since when, I began to think about you like that, I
can't say, I don't remember… ."

Fenya came in and put a tray with an uncorked bottle and three
glasses of champagne on the table.

"Here's the champagne!" cried Rakitin. "You're excited, Agrafena
Alexandrovna, and not yourself. When you've had a glass of
champagne, you'll be ready to dance. Eh, they can't even do that
properly," he added, looking at the bottle. "The old woman's poured
it out in the kitchen and the bottle's been brought in warm and
without a cork. Well, let me have some, anyway."
