"What is it again?" Father Zossima asked, smiling gently. "The
worldly may follow the dead with tears, but here we rejoice over
the father who is departing. We rejoice and pray for him. Leave me,
I must pray. Go, and make haste. Be near your brothers. And not
near one only, but near both."

Father Zossima raised his hand to bless him. Alyosha could make
no protest, though he had a great longing to remain. He longed,
moreover, to ask the significance of his bowing to Dmitri, the
question was on the tip of his tongue, but he dared not ask it. He
knew that the elder would have explained it unasked if he had
thought fit. But evidently it was not his will. That action had
made a terrible impression on Alyosha; he believed blindly in its
mysterious significance. Mysterious, and perhaps awful.

As he hastened out of the hermatage precincts to reach the
monastery in time to serve at the Father Superior's dinner, he felt
a sudden pang at his heart, and stopped short. He seemed to hear
again Father Zossima's words, foretelling his approaching end. What
he had foretold so exactly must infallibly come to pass. Alyosha
believed that implicitly. But how could he go? He had told him not
to weep, and to leave the monastery. Good God! It was long since
Alyosha had known such anguish. He hurried through the copse that
divided the monastery from the hermitage, and unable to bear the
burden of his thoughts, he gazed at the ancient pines beside the
path. He had not far to go- about five hundred paces. He expected
to meet no one at that hour, but at the first turn of the path he
noticed Rakitin. He was waiting for someone.

"Are you waiting for me?" asked Alyosha, overtaking him.

"Yes," grinned Rakitin. "You are hurrying to the Father
Superior, I know; he has a banquet. There's not been such a banquet
since the Superior entertained the Bishop and General Pahatov, do
you remember? I shan't be there, but you go and hand the sauces.
Tell me one thing, Alexey, what does that vision mean? That's what
I want to ask you."

"What vision?"

"That bowing to your brother, Dmitri. And didn't he tap the
ground with his forehead, too!"

"You speak of Father Zossima?"

"Yes, of Father Zossima,"

"Tapped the ground?"
