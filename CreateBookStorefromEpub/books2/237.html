<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>3<br/>An<br/>Onion<br/><br/><br/>GRUSHENKA lived in the busiest part of the town, near the<br/>cathedral square, in a small wooden lodge in the courtyard<br/>belonging to the house of the widow Morozov. The house was a large<br/>stone building of two stories, old and very ugly. The widow led a<br/>secluded life with her two unmarried nieces, who were also elderly<br/>women. She had no need to let her lodge, but everyone knew that she<br/>had taken in Grushenka as a lodger, four years before, solely to<br/>please her kinsman, the merchant Samsonov, who was known to the<br/>girl's protector. It was said that the jealous old man's object in<br/>placing his "favourite" with the widow Morozov was that the old<br/>woman should keep a sharp eye on her new lodger's conduct. But this<br/>sharp eye soon proved to be unnecessary, and in the end the widow<br/>Morozov seldom met Grushenka and did not worry her by looking after<br/>her in any way. It is true that four years had passed since the old<br/>man had brought the slim, delicate, shy, timid, dreamy, and sad<br/>girl of eighteen from the chief town of the province, and much had<br/>happened since then. Little was known of the girl's history in the<br/>town and that little was vague. Nothing more had been learnt during<br/>the last four years, even after many persons had become interested<br/>in the beautiful young woman into whom Agrafena Alexandrovna had<br/>meanwhile developed. There were rumours that she had been at<br/>seventeen betrayed by someone, some sort of officer, and<br/>immediately afterwards abandoned by him. The officer had gone away<br/>and afterwards married, while Grushenka had been left in poverty<br/>and disgrace. It was said, however, that though Grushenka had been<br/>raised from destitution by the old man, Samsonov, she came of a<br/>respectable family belonging to the clerical class, that she was<br/>the daughter of a deacon or something of the sort.<br/><br/>And now after four years the sensitive, injured and pathetic<br/>little orphan had become a plump, rosy beauty of the Russian type,<br/>a woman of bold and determined character, proud and insolent. She<br/>had a good head for business, was acquisitive, saving and careful,<br/>and by fair means or foul had succeeded, it was said, in amassing a<br/>little fortune. There was only, one point on which all were agreed.<br/>Grushenka was not easily to be approached and, except her aged<br/>protector, there had not been one man who could boast of her<br/>favours during those four years. It was a positive fact, for there<br/>had been a good many, especially during the last two years, who had<br/>attempted to obtain those favours. But all their efforts had been<br/>in vain and some of these suitors had been forced to beat an<br/>undignified and even comic retreat, owing to the firm and ironical<br/>resistance they met from the strong-willed young person. It was<br/>known, too, that the young person had, especially of late, been<br/>given to what is called "speculation," and that she had shown<br/>marked abilities in that direction, so that many people began to<br/>say that she was no better than a Jew. It was not that she lent<br/>money on interest, but it was known, for instance, that she had for<br/>some time past, in partnership with old Karamazov, actually<br/>invested in the purchase of bad debts for a trifle, a tenth of<br/>their nominal value, and afterwards had made out of them ten times<br/>their value.<br/><br/>The old widower Samsonov, a man of large fortune, was stingy and<br/>merciless. He tyrannised over his grown-up sons, but, for the last<br/>year during which he had been ill and lost the use of his swollen<br/>legs, he had fallen greatly under the influence of his protegee,<br/>whom he had at first kept strictly and in humble surroundings, "on<br/>Lenten fare," as the wits said at the time. But Grushenka had<br/>succeeded in emancipating herself, while she established in him a<br/>boundless belief in her fidelity. The old man, now long since dead,<br/>had had a large business in his day and was also a noteworthy<br/>character, miserly and hard as flint. Though Grushenka's hold upon<br/>him was so strong that he could not live without her (it had been<br/>so especially for the last two years), he did not settle any<br/>considerable fortune on her and would not have been moved to do so,<br/>if she had threatened to leave him. But he had presented her with a<br/>small sum, and even that was a surprise to everyone when it became<br/>known.<br/><br/>"You are a wench with brains," he said to her, when he gave her<br/>eight thousand roubles, "and you must look after yourself, but let<br/>me tell you that except your yearly allowance as before, you'll get<br/>nothing more from me to the day of my death, and I'll leave you<br/>nothing in my will either."<br/><br/>And he kept his word; he died and left everything to his sons,<br/>whom, with their wives and children, he had treated all his life as<br/>servants. Grushenka was not even mentioned in his will. All this<br/>became known afterwards. He helped Grushenka with his advice to<br/>increase her capital and put business in her way.<br/><br/>When Fyodor Pavlovitch, who first came into contact with<br/>Grushenka over a piece of speculation, ended to his own surprise by<br/>falling madly in love with her, old Samsonov, gravely ill as he<br/>was, was immensely amused. It is remarkable that throughout their<br/>whole acquaintance Grushenka was absolutely and spontaneously open<br/>with the old man, and he seems to have been the only person in the<br/>world with whom she was so. Of late, when Dmitri too had come on<br/>the scene with his love, the old man left off laughing. On the<br/>contrary, he once gave Grushenka a stern and earnest piece of<br/>advice.<br/><br/>"If you have to choose between the two, father or son, you'd<br/>better choose the old man, if only you make sure the old scoundrel<br/>will marry you and settle some fortune on you beforehand. But don't<br/>keep on with the captain, you'll get no good out of that."<br/>
