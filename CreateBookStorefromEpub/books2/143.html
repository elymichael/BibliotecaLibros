<br/>"That's true, that's true," cried Madame Hohlakov.<br/><br/>"Wait, dear. I haven't told you the chief, the final decision I<br/>came to during the night. I feel that perhaps my decision is a<br/>terrible one- for me, but I foresee that nothing will induce me to<br/>change it- nothing. It will be so all my life. My dear, kind,<br/>ever-faithful and generous adviser, the one friend I have in the<br/>world, Ivan Fyodorovitch, with his deep insight into the heart,<br/>approves and commends my decision. He knows it."<br/><br/>"Yes, I approve of it," Ivan assented, in a subdued but firm<br/>voice.<br/><br/>"But I should like Alyosha, too (Ah! Alexey Fyodorovitch,<br/>forgive my calling you simply Alyosha), I should like Alexey<br/>Fyodorovitch, too, to tell me before my two friends whether I am<br/>right. I feel instinctively that you, Alyosha, my dear brother (for<br/>are a dear brother to me)," she said again ecstatically, taking his<br/>cold hand in her hot one, "I foresee that your decision, your<br/>approval, will bring me peace, in spite of all my sufferings, for,<br/>after your words, I shall be calm and submit- I feel that."<br/><br/>"I don't know what you are asking me," said Alyosha, flushing.<br/>"I only know that I love you and at this moment wish for your<br/>happiness more than my own!… But I know nothing about such<br/>affairs," something impelled him to add hurriedly.<br/><br/>"In such affairs, Alexey Fyodorovitch, in such affairs, the<br/>chief thing is honour and duty and something higher- I don't know<br/>what but higher perhaps even than duty. I am conscious of this<br/>irresistible feeling in my heart, and it compels me irresistibly.<br/>But it may all be put in two words. I've already decided, even if<br/>he marries that- creature," she began solemnly, "whom I never,<br/>never can forgive, even then I will not abandon him. Henceforward I<br/>will never, never abandon him!" she cried, breaking into a sort of<br/>pale, hysterical ecstasy. "Not that I would run after him<br/>continually, get in his way and worry him. Oh, no! I will go away<br/>to another town- where you like- but I will watch over him all my<br/>life- I will watch over him all my life unceasingly. When he<br/>becomes unhappy with that woman, and that is bound to happen quite<br/>soon, let him come to me and he will find a friend, a sister… Only<br/>a sister, of course, and so for ever; but he will learn at least<br/>that that sister is really his sister, who loves him and has<br/>sacrificed all her life to him. I will gain my point. I will insist<br/>on his knowing me confiding entirely in me, without reserve," she<br/>cried, in a sort of frenzy. "I will be a god to whom he can pray-<br/>and that, at least, he owes me for his treachery and for what I<br/>suffered yesterday through him. And let him see that all my life I<br/>will be true to him and the promise I gave him, in spite of his<br/>being untrue and betraying me. I will- I will become nothing but a<br/>means for his happiness, or- how shall I say?- an instrument, a<br/>machine for his happiness, and that for my whole life, my whole<br/>life, and that he may see that all his life! That's my decision.<br/>Ivan Fyodorovitch fully approves me."<br/><br/>She was breathless. She had perhaps intended to express her idea<br/>with more dignity, art and naturalness, but her speech was too<br/>hurried and crude. It was full of youthful impulsiveness, it<br/>betrayed that she was still smarting from yesterday's insult, and<br/>that her pride craved satisfaction. She felt this herself. Her face<br/>suddenly darkened, an unpleasant look came into her eyes. Alyosha<br/>at once saw it and felt a pang of sympathy. His brother Ivan made<br/>it worse by adding:<br/><br/>"I've only expressed my own view," he said. "From anyone else,<br/>this would have been affected and over-strained, but from you- no.<br/>Any other woman would have been wrong, but you are right. I don't<br/>know how to explain it, but I see that you are absolutely genuine<br/>and, therefore, you are right."<br/><br/>"But that's only for the moment. And what does this moment stand<br/>for? Nothing but yesterday's insult." Madame Hohlakov obviously had<br/>not intended to interfere, but she could not refrain from this very<br/>just comment.<br/><br/>"Quite so, quite so," cried Ivan, with peculiar eagerness,<br/>obviously annoyed at being interrupted, "in anyone else this moment<br/>would be only due to yesterday's impression and would be only a<br/>moment. But with Katerina Ivanovna's character, that moment will<br/>last all her life. What for anyone else would be only a promise is<br/>for her an everlasting burdensome, grim perhaps, but unflagging<br/>duty. And she will be sustained by the feeling of this duty being<br/>fulfilled. Your life, Katerina Ivanovna, will henceforth be spent<br/>in painful brooding over your own feelings, your own heroism, and<br/>your own suffering; but in the end that suffering will be softened<br/>and will pass into sweet contemplation of the fulfilment of a bold<br/>and proud design. Yes, proud it certainly is, and desperate in any<br/>case, but a triumph for you. And the consciousness of it will at<br/>last be a source of complete satisfaction and will make you<br/>resigned to everything else."<br/><br/>
