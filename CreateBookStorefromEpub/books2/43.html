<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>6<br/>Why Is Such a Man Alive?<br/><br/><br/>DMITRI FYODOROVITCH, a young man of eight and twenty, of medium<br/>height and agreeable countenance, looked older than his years. He<br/>was muscular, and showed signs of considerable physical strength.<br/>Yet there was something not healthy in his face. It was rather<br/>thin, his cheeks were hollow, and there was an unhealthy sallowness<br/>in their colour. His rather large, prominent, dark eyes had an<br/>expression of firm determination, and yet there was a vague look in<br/>them, too. Even when he was excited and talking irritably, his eyes<br/>somehow did not follow his mood, but betrayed something else,<br/>sometimes quite incongruous with what was passing. "It's hard to<br/>tell what he's thinking," those who talked to him sometimes<br/>declared. People who saw something pensive and sullen in his eyes<br/>were startled by his sudden laugh, which bore witness to mirthful<br/>and light-hearted thoughts at the very time when his eyes were so<br/>gloomy. A certain strained look in his face was easy to understand<br/>at this moment. Everyone knew, or had heard of, the extremely<br/>restless and dissipated life which he had been leading of late, as<br/>well as of the violent anger to which he had been roused in his<br/>quarrels with his father. There were several stories current in the<br/>town about it. It is true that he was irascible by nature, "of an<br/>unstable and unbalanced mind," as our justice of the peace,<br/>Katchalnikov, happily described him.<br/><br/>He was stylishly and irreproachably dressed in a carefully<br/>buttoned frock-coat. He wore black gloves and carried a top hat.<br/>Having only lately left the army, he still had moustaches and no<br/>beard. His dark brown hair was cropped short, and combed forward on<br/>his temples. He had the long, determined stride of a military man.<br/>He stood still for a moment on the threshold, and glancing at the<br/>whole party went straight up to the elder, guessing him to be their<br/>host. He made him a low bow, and asked his blessing. Father<br/>Zossima, rising in his chair, blessed him. Dmitri kissed his hand<br/>respectfully, and with intense feeling, almost anger, he said:<br/><br/>"Be so generous as to forgive me for having kept you waiting so<br/>long, but Smerdyakov, the valet sent me by my father, in reply to<br/>my inquiries, told me twice over that the appointment was for one.<br/>Now I suddenly learn- "<br/><br/>"Don't disturb yourself," interposed the elder. "No matter. You<br/>are a little late. It's of no consequenceâ€¦ . "<br/><br/>"I'm extremely obliged to you, and expected no less from your<br/>goodness."<br/><br/>Saying this, Dmitri bowed once more. Then, turning suddenly<br/>towards his father, made him, too, a similarly low and respectful<br/>bow. He had evidently considered it beforehand, and made this bow<br/>in all seriousness, thinking it his duty to show his respect and<br/>good intentions.<br/><br/>Although Fyodor Pavlovitch was taken unawares, he was equal to<br/>the occasion. In response to Dmitri's bow he jumped up from his<br/>chair and made his son a bow as low in return. His face was<br/>suddenly solemn and impressive, which gave him a positively<br/>malignant look. Dmitri bowed generally to all present, and without<br/>a word walked to the window with his long, resolute stride, sat<br/>down on the only empty chair, near Father Paissy, and, bending<br/>forward, prepared to listen to the conversation he had<br/>interrupted.<br/>
