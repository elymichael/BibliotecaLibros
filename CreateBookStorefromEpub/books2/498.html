"If I thought of anything then," he began again, "it was solely<br/>of some wickedness on your part. Dmitri might kill him, but that he<br/>would steal- I did not believe that thenâ€¦ . But I was prepared for<br/>any wickedness from you. You told me yourself you could sham a fit.<br/>What did you say that for?"<br/><br/>"It was just through my simplicity, and I never have shammed a<br/>fit on purpose in my life. And I only said so then to boast to you.<br/>It was just foolishness. I liked you so much then, and was<br/>open-hearted with you."<br/><br/>"My brother directly accuses you of the murder and theft."<br/><br/>"What else is left for him to do?" said Smerdyakov, with a<br/>bitter grin. "And who will believe him with all the proofs against<br/>him? Grigory Vassilyevitch saw the door open. What can he say after<br/>that? But never mind him! He is trembling to save himself."<br/><br/>He slowly ceased speaking; then suddenly, as though on<br/>reflection, added:<br/><br/>"And look here again. He wants to throw it on me and make out<br/>that it is the work of my hands- I've heard that already. But as to<br/>my being clever at shamming a fit: should I have told you<br/>beforehand that I could sham one, if I really had had such a design<br/>against your father? If I had been planning such a murder could I<br/>have been such a fool as to give such evidence against myself<br/>beforehand? And to his son, too! Upon my word! Is that likely? As<br/>if that could be; such a thing has never happened. No one hears<br/>this talk of ours now, except Providence itself, and if you were to<br/>tell of it to the prosecutor and Nikolay Parfenovitch you might<br/>defend me completely by doing so, for who would be likely to be<br/>such a criminal, if he is so open-hearted beforehand? Anyone can<br/>see that."<br/><br/>"Well," and Ivan got up to cut short the conversation, struck by<br/>Smerdyakov's last argument. "I don't suspect you at all, and I<br/>think it's absurd, indeed, to suspect you. On the contrary, I am<br/>grateful to you for setting my mind at rest. Now I am going, but<br/>I'll come again. Meanwhile, good-bye. Get well. Is there anything<br/>you want?"<br/><br/>"I am very thankful for everything. Marfa Ignatyevna does not<br/>forget me, and provides me anything I want, according to her<br/>kindness. Good people visit me every day."<br/><br/>"Good-bye. But I shan't say anything of your being able to sham<br/>a fit, and I don't advise you to, either," something made Ivan say<br/>suddenly.<br/><br/>"I quite understand. And if you don't speak of that, I shall say<br/>nothing of that conversation of ours at the gate."<br/><br/>Then it happened that Ivan went out, and only when he had gone a<br/>dozen steps along the corridor, he suddenly felt that there was an<br/>insulting significance in Smerdyakov's last words. He was almost on<br/>the point of turning back, but it was only a passing impulse, and<br/>muttering, "Nonsense!" he went out of the hospital.<br/>
