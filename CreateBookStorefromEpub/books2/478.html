"Then he despises me, me?"<br/><br/>"You, too."<br/><br/>"Good." Lise seemed to grind her teeth. "When he went out<br/>laughing, I felt that it was nice to be despised. The child with<br/>fingers cut off is nice, and to be despised is niceâ€¦ "<br/><br/>And she laughed in Alyosha's face, a feverish malicious<br/>laugh.<br/><br/>"Do you know, Alyosha, do you know, I should like- Alyosha, save<br/>me!" She suddenly jumped from the couch, rushed to him and seized<br/>him with both hands. "Save me!" she almost groaned. "Is there<br/>anyone in the world I could tell what I've told you? I've told you<br/>the truth, the truth. I shall kill myself, because I loathe<br/>everything! I don't want to live, because I loathe everything! I<br/>loathe everything, everything. Alyosha, why don't you love me in<br/>the least?" she finished in a frenzy.<br/><br/>"But I do love you!" answered Alyosha warmly.<br/><br/>"And will you weep over me, will you?"<br/><br/>"Yes."<br/><br/>"Not because I won't be your wife, but simply weep for me?"<br/><br/>"Yes."<br/><br/>"Thank you! It's only your tears I want. Everyone else may<br/>punish me and trample me under foot, everyone, everyone, not<br/>excepting anyone. For I don't love anyone. Do you hear, not anyone!<br/>On the contrary, I hate him! Go, Alyosha; it's time you went to<br/>your brother"; she tore herself away from him suddenly.<br/>
