This was unmistakably said with some malice and obviously with<br/>intention; even perhaps with no desire to conceal that he spoke<br/>ironically and with intention.<br/><br/>"Oh, dear, how mistaken it all is!" Madame Hohlakov cried<br/>again.<br/><br/>"Alexey Fyodorovitch, you speak. I want dreadfully to know what<br/>you will say!" cried Katerina Ivanovna, and burst into tears.<br/>Alyosha got up from the sofa.<br/><br/>"It's nothing, nothing!" she went on through her tears. "I'm<br/>upset, I didn't sleep last night. But by the side of two such<br/>friends as you and your brother I still feel strong- for I know you<br/>two will never desert me."<br/><br/>"Unluckily I am obliged to return to Moscow- perhaps to-morrow-<br/>and to leave you for a long time- and, unluckily, it's<br/>unavoidable," Ivan said suddenly.<br/><br/>"To-morrow- to Moscow!" her face was suddenly contorted; "but-<br/>but, dear me, how fortunate!" she cried in a voice suddenly<br/>changed. In one instant there was no trace left of her tears. She<br/>underwent an instantaneous transformation, which amazed Alyosha.<br/>Instead of a poor, insulted girl, weeping in a sort of<br/>"laceration," he saw a woman completely self-possessed and even<br/>exceedingly pleased, as though something agreeable had just<br/>happened.<br/><br/>"Oh, not fortunate that I am losing you, of course not," she<br/>collected herself suddenly, with a charming society smile. "Such a<br/>friend as you are could not suppose that. I am only too unhappy at<br/>losing you." She rushed impulsively at Ivan, and seizing both his<br/>hands, pressed them warmly. "But what is fortunate is that you will<br/>be able in Moscow to see auntie and Agafya and to tell them all the<br/>horror of my present position. You can speak with complete openness<br/>to Agafya, but spare dear auntie. You will know how to do that. You<br/>can't think how wretched I was yesterday and this morning,<br/>wondering how I could write them that dreadful letter- for one can<br/>never tell such things in a letter… Now it will be easy for me to<br/>write, for you will see them and explain everything. Oh, how glad I<br/>am! But I am only glad of that, believe me. Of course, no one can<br/>take your place… . I will run at once to write the letter," she<br/>finished suddenly, and took a step as though to go out of the<br/>room.<br/><br/>"And what about Alyosha and his opinion, which you were so<br/>desperately anxious to hear?" cried Madame Hohlakov. There was a<br/>sarcastic, angry note in her voice.<br/><br/>"I had not forgotten that," cried Katerina Ivanovna, coming to a<br/>sudden standstill, "and why are you so antagonistic at such a<br/>moment?" she added, with warm and bitter reproachfulness. "What I<br/>said, I repeat. I must have his opinion. More than that, I must<br/>have his decision! As he says, so it shall be. You see how anxious<br/>I am for your words, Alexey Fyodorovitch… But what's the<br/>matter?"<br/><br/>"I couldn't have believed it. I can't understand it!" Alyosha<br/>cried suddenly in distress.<br/><br/>"He is going to Moscow, and you cry out that you are glad. You<br/>said that on purpose! And you begin explaining that you are not<br/>glad of that but sorry to be- losing a friend. But that was acting,<br/>too- you were playing a part as in a theatre!"<br/>
