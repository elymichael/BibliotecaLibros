<br/>"You ask what were my exact sensations at the moment when I<br/>asked my opponent's forgiveness," I answered; "but I had better<br/>tell you from the beginning what I have not yet told anyone else."<br/>And I described all that had passed between Afanasy and me, and how<br/>I had bowed down to the ground at his feet. "From that you can see<br/>for yourself," I concluded, "that at the time of the duel it was<br/>easier for me, for I had made a beginning already at home, and when<br/>once I had started on that road, to go farther along it was far<br/>from being difficult, but became a source of joy and<br/>happiness."<br/><br/>I liked the way he looked at me as he listened. "All that," he<br/>said, "is exceedingly interesting. I will come to see you again and<br/>again."<br/><br/>And from that time forth he came to see me nearly every evening.<br/>And we should have become greater friends, if only he had ever<br/>talked of himself. But about himself he scarcely ever said a word,<br/>yet continually asked me about myself. In spite of that I became<br/>very fond of him and spoke with perfect frankness to him about all<br/>my feelings; "for," thought I, "what need have I to know his<br/>secrets, since I can see without that that is a good man? Moreover,<br/>though he is such a serious man and my senior, he comes to see a<br/>youngster like me and treats me as his equal." And I learned a<br/>great deal that was profitable from him, for he was a man of lofty<br/>mind.<br/><br/>"That life is heaven," he said to me suddenly, "that I have long<br/>been thinking about"; and all at once he added, "I think of nothing<br/>else indeed." He looked at me and smiled. "I am more convinced of<br/>it than you are, I will tell you later why."<br/><br/>I listened to him and thought that he evidently wanted to tell<br/>me something.<br/><br/>"Heaven," he went on, "lies hidden within all of us- here it<br/>lies hidden in me now, and if I will it, it will be revealed to me<br/>to-morrow and for all time."<br/><br/>I looked at him; he was speaking with great emotion and gazing<br/>mysteriously at me, as if he were questioning me.<br/><br/>"And that we are all responsible to all for all, apart from our<br/>own sins, you were quite right in thinking that, and it is<br/>wonderful how you could comprehend it in all its significance at<br/>once. And in very truth, so soon as men understand that, the<br/>Kingdom of Heaven will be for them not a dream, but a living<br/>reality."<br/><br/>"And when," I cried out to him bitterly, "when will that come to<br/>pass? and will it ever come to pass? Is not it simply a dream of<br/>ours?"<br/><br/>"What then, you don't believe it," he said. "You preach it and<br/>don't believe it yourself. Believe me, this dream, as you call it,<br/>will come to pass without doubt; it will come, but not now, for<br/>every process has its law. It's a spiritual, psychological process.<br/>To transform the world, to recreate it afresh, men must turn into<br/>another path psychologically. Until you have become really, in<br/>actual fact, a brother to everyone, brotherhood will not come to<br/>pass. No sort of scientific teaching, no kind of common interest,<br/>will ever teach men to share property and privileges with equal<br/>consideration for all. Everyone will think his share too small and<br/>they will be always envying, complaining and attacking one another.<br/>You ask when it will come to pass; it will come to pass, but first<br/>we have to go though the period of isolation."<br/><br/>
