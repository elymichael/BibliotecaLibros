<br/>"Vile slut! Go away!"<br/><br/>"Ah, for shame, young lady! Ah, for shame! That's unbecoming for<br/>you, dear young lady, a word like that."<br/><br/>"Go away! You're a creature for sale" screamed Katerina<br/>Ivanovna. Every feature was working in her utterly distorted<br/>face.<br/><br/>"For sale indeed! You used to visit gentlemen in the dusk for<br/>money once; you brought your beauty for sale. You see, I know."<br/><br/>Katerina Ivanovna shrieked, and would have rushed at her, but<br/>Alyosha held her with all his strength.<br/><br/>"Not a step, not a word! Don't speak, don't answer her. She'll<br/>go away- she'll go at once."<br/><br/>At that instant Katerina Ivanovna's two aunts ran in at her cry,<br/>and with them a maid-servant. All hurried to her.<br/><br/>"I will go away," said Grushenka, taking up her mantle from the<br/>sofa. "Alyosha, darling, see me home!"<br/><br/>"Go away- go away, make haste!" cried Alyosha, clasping his<br/>hands imploringly.<br/><br/>"Dear little Alyosha, see me home! I've got a pretty little<br/>story to tell you on the way. I got up this scene for your benefit,<br/>Alyosha. See me home, dear, you'll be glad of it afterwards."<br/><br/>
