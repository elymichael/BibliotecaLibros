"That I certainly will, without fail," cried Fyodor Pavlovitch,
hugely delighted at the invitation. "And, believe me, we've all
given our word to behave properly here… . And you, Pyotr
Alexandrovitch, will you go, too?"

"Yes, of course. What have I come for but to study all the
customs here? The only obstacle to me is your company… ."

"Yes, Dmitri Fyodorovitch is non-existent as yet."

"It would be a capital thing if he didn't turn up. Do you
suppose I like all this business, and in your company, too? So we
will come to dinner. Thank the Father Superior," he said to the
monk.

"No, it is my duty now to conduct you to the elder," answered
the monk.

"If so I'll go straight to the Father Superior- to the Father
Superior," babbled Maximov.

"The Father Superior is engaged just now. But as you please- "
the monk hesitated.

"Impertinent old man!" Miusov observed aloud, while Maximov ran
back to the monastery.

"He's like von Sohn," Fyodor Pavlovitch said suddenly.

"Is that all you can think of?… In what way is he like von Sohn?
Have you ever seen von Sohn?"

"I've seen his portrait. It's not the features, but something
indefinable. He's a second von Sohn. I can always tell from the
physiognomy."
