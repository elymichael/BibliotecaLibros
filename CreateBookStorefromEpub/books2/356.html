<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>4<br/>The Second Ordeal<br/><br/><br/>"YOU don't know how you encourage us, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, by<br/>your readiness to answer," said Nikolay Parfenovitch, with an<br/>animated air, and obvious satisfaction beaming in his very<br/>prominent, short-sighted, light grey eyes, from which he had<br/>removed his spectacles a moment before. "And you have made a very<br/>just remark about the mutual confidence, without which it is<br/>sometimes positively impossible to get on in cases of such<br/>importance, if the suspected party really hopes and desires to<br/>defend himself and is in a position to do so. We on our side, will<br/>do everything in our power, and you can see for yourself how we are<br/>conducting the case. You approve, Ippolit Kirillovitch?" He turned<br/>to the prosecutor.<br/><br/>"Oh, undoubtedly," replied the prosecutor. His tone was somewhat<br/>cold, compared with Nikolay Parfenovitch's impulsiveness.<br/><br/>I will note once for all that Nikolay Parfenovitch, who had but<br/>lately arrived among us, had from the first felt marked respect for<br/>Ippolit Kirillovitch, our prosecutor, and had become almost his<br/>bosom friend. He was almost the only person who put implicit faith<br/>in Ippolit Kirillovitch's extraordinary talents as a psychologist<br/>and orator and in the justice of his grievance. He had heard of him<br/>in Petersburg. On the other hand, young Nikolay Parfenovitch was<br/>the only person in the whole world whom our "unappreciated"<br/>prosecutor genuinely liked. On their way to Mokroe they had time to<br/>come to an understanding about the present case. And now as they<br/>sat at the table, the sharp-witted junior caught and interpreted<br/>every indication on his senior colleague's face- half a word, a<br/>glance, or a wink.<br/><br/>"Gentlemen, only let me tell my own story and don't interrupt me<br/>with trivial questions and I'll tell you everything in a moment,"<br/>said Mitya excitedly.<br/><br/>"Excellent! Thank you. But before we proceed to listen to your<br/>communication, will you allow me to inquire as to another little<br/>fact of great interest to us? I mean the ten roubles you borrowed<br/>yesterday at about five o'clock on the security of your pistols,<br/>from your friend, Pyotr Ilyitch Perhotin."<br/><br/>"I pledged them, gentlemen. I pledged them for ten roubles. What<br/>more? That's all about it. As soon as I got back to town I pledged<br/>them."<br/><br/>"You got back to town? Then you had been out of town?"<br/>
