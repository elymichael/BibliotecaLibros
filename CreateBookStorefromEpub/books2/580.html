"But the prisoner even then did not murder him- I maintain that,<br/>I cry that aloud!- no, he only brandished the pestle in a burst of<br/>indignant disgust, not meaning to kill him, not knowing that he<br/>would kill him. Had he not had this fatal pestle in his hand, he<br/>would have only knocked his father down perhaps, but would not have<br/>killed him. As he ran away, he did not know whether he had killed<br/>the old man. Such a murder is not a murder. Such a murder is not a<br/>parricide. No, the murder of such a father cannot be called<br/>parricide. Such a murder can only be reckoned parricide by<br/>prejudice.<br/><br/>"But I appeal to you again and again from the depths of my soul;<br/>did this murder actually take place? Gentlemen of the jury, if we<br/>convict and punish him, he will say to himself: 'These people have<br/>done nothing for my bringing up, for my education, nothing to<br/>improve my lot, nothing to make me better, nothing to make me a<br/>man. These people have not given me to eat and to drink, have not<br/>visited me in prison and nakedness, and here they have sent me to<br/>penal servitude. I am quits, I owe them nothing now, and owe no one<br/>anything for ever. They are wicked and I will be wicked. They are<br/>cruel and I will be cruel.' That is what he will say, gentlemen of<br/>the jury. And I swear, by finding him guilty you will only make it<br/>easier for him: you will ease his conscience, he will curse the<br/>blood he has shed and will not regret it. At the same time you will<br/>destroy in him the possibility of becoming a new man, for he will<br/>remain in his wickedness and blindness all his life.<br/><br/>"But do you want to punish him fearfully, terribly, with the<br/>most awful punishment that could be imagined, and at the same time<br/>to save him and regenerate his soul? If so, overwhelm him with your<br/>mercy! You will see, you will hear how he will tremble and be<br/>horror-struck. 'How can I endure this mercy? How can I endure so<br/>much love? Am I worthy of it?' That's what he will exclaim.<br/><br/>"Oh, I know, I know that heart, that wild but grateful heart,<br/>gentlemen of the jury! It will bow before your mercy; it thirsts<br/>for a great and loving action, it will melt and mount upwards.<br/>There are souls which, in their limitation, blame the whole world.<br/>But subdue such a soul with mercy, show it love, and it will curse<br/>its past, for there are many good impulses in it. Such a heart will<br/>expand and see that God is merciful and that men are good and just.<br/>He will be horror-stricken; he will be crushed by remorse and the<br/>vast obligation laid upon him henceforth. And he will not say then,<br/>'I am quits,' but will say, 'I am guilty in the sight of all men<br/>and am more unworthy than all.' With tears of penitence and<br/>poignant, tender anguish, he will exclaim: 'Others are better than<br/>I, they wanted to save me, not to ruin me!' Oh, this act of mercy<br/>is so easy for you, for in the absence of anything like real<br/>evidence it will be too awful for you to pronounce: 'Yes, he is<br/>guilty.'<br/><br/>"Better acquit ten guilty men than punish one innocent man! Do<br/>you hear, do you hear that majestic voice from the past century of<br/>our glorious history? It is not for an insignificant person like me<br/>to remind you that the Russian court does not exist for the<br/>punishment only, but also for the salvation of the criminal! Let<br/>other nations think of retribution and the letter of the law, we<br/>will cling to the spirit and the meaning- the salvation and the<br/>reformation of the lost. If this is true, if Russia and her justice<br/>are such, she may go forward with good cheer! Do not try to scare<br/>us with your frenzied troikas from which all the nations stand<br/>aside in disgust. Not a runaway troika, but the stately chariot of<br/>Russia will move calmly and majestically to its goal. In your hands<br/>is the fate of my client, in your hands is the fate of Russian<br/>justice. You will defend it, you will save it, you will prove that<br/>there are men to watch over it, that it is in good hands!"<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
