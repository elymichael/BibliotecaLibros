<br/>"Ah! if it were only Zhutchka!"<br/><br/>"That's impossible. Zhutchka's non-existent. Zhutchka is lost in<br/>the mists of obscurity."<br/><br/>"Ah! couldn't we do this?" Smurov suddenly stood still. "You see<br/>Ilusha says that Zhutchka was a shaggy, greyish, smoky-looking dog<br/>like Perezvon. Couldn't you tell him this is Zhutchka, and he might<br/>believe you?"<br/><br/>"Boy, shun a lie, that's one thing; even with a good object-<br/>that's another. Above all, I hope you've not told them anything<br/>about my coming."<br/><br/>"Heaven forbid! I know what I am about. But you won't comfort<br/>him with Perezvon," said Smurov, with a sigh. "You know his father,<br/>the captain, 'the wisp of tow,' told us that he was going to bring<br/>him a real mastiff pup, with a black nose, to-day. He thinks that<br/>would comfort Ilusha; but I doubt it."<br/><br/>"And how is Ilusha?"<br/><br/>"Ah, he is bad, very bad! I believe he's in consumption: he is<br/>quite conscious, but his breathing! His breathing's gone wrong. The<br/>other day he asked to have his boots on to be led round the room.<br/>He tried to walk, but he couldn't stand. 'Ah, I told you before,<br/>father,' he said, 'that those boots were no good. I could never<br/>walk properly in them.' He fancied it was his boots that made him<br/>stagger, but it was simply weakness, really. He won't live another<br/>week. Herzenstube is looking after him. Now they are rich again-<br/>they've got heaps of money.<br/><br/>"They are rogues."<br/><br/>"Who are rogues?"<br/><br/>"Doctors and the whole crew of quacks collectively, and also, of<br/>course, individually. I don't believe in medicine. It's a useless<br/>institution. I mean to go into all that. But what's that<br/>sentimentality you've got up there? The whole class seems to be<br/>there every day."<br/><br/>
