"You understand? He understands it! Monster and parricide! Your
father's blood cries out against you!" the old captain of police
roared suddenly, stepping up to Mitya.

He was beside himself, crimson in the face and quivering all
over.

"This is impossible!" cried the small young man. "Mihail
Makarovitch, Mihail Makarovitch, this won't do!… I beg you'll allow
me to speak. I should never have expected such behaviour from you…
"

"This is delirium, gentlemen, raving delirium," cried the
captain of police; "look at him: drunk, at this time of night, in
the company of a disreputable woman, with the blood of his father
on his hands… . It's delirium!… " "I beg you most earnestly, dear
Mihail Makarovitch, to restrain your feelings," the prosecutor said
in a rapid whisper to the old police captain, "or I shall be forced
to resort to- "

But the little lawyer did not allow him to finish. He turned to
Mitya, and delivered himself in a loud, firm, dignified voice:

"Ex-Lieutenant Karamazov, it is my duty to inform you that you
are charged with the murder of your father, Fyodor Pavlovitch
Karamazov, perpetrated this night… "

He said something more, and the prosecutor, too, put in
something, but though Mitya heard them he did not understand them.
He stared at them all with wild eyes.
