"Why, I called to you and brought you out here to-day, this very<br/>day- remember it- to send you- this very day again- to Katerina<br/>Ivanovna, and- "<br/><br/>"To tell her that I shall never come to see her again. Say, 'He<br/>sends you his compliments.'"<br/><br/>"But is that possible?"<br/><br/>"That's just the reason I'm sending you, in my place, because<br/>it's impossible. And, how could I tell her myself?"<br/><br/>"And where are you going?"<br/><br/>"To the back-alley."<br/><br/>"To Grushenka, then!" Alyosha exclaimed mournfully, clasping his<br/>hands. "Can Rakitin really have told the truth? I thought that you<br/>had just visited her, and that was all."<br/><br/>"Can a betrothed man pay such visits? Is such a thing possible<br/>and with such a betrothed, and before the eyes of all the world?<br/>Confound it, I have some honour! As soon as I began visiting<br/>Grushenka, I ceased to be betrothed, and to be an honest man. I<br/>understand that. Why do you look at me? You see, I went in the<br/>first place to beat her. I had heard, and I know for a fact now,<br/>that that captain, father's agent, had given Grushenka an I.O.U. of<br/>mine for her to sue me for payment, so as to put an end to me. They<br/>wanted to scare me. I went to beat her. I had had a glimpse of her<br/>before. She doesn't strike one at first sight. I knew about her old<br/>merchant, who's lying ill now, paralysed; but he's leaving her a<br/>decent little sum. I knew, too, that she was fond of money, that<br/>she hoarded it, and lent it at a wicked rate of interest, that<br/>she's a merciless cheat and swindler. I went to beat her, and I<br/>stayed. The storm broke- it struck me down like the plague. I'm<br/>plague-stricken still, and I know that everything is over, that<br/>there will never be anything more for me. The cycle of the ages is<br/>accomplished. That's my position. And though I'm a beggar, as fate<br/>would have it, I had three thousand just then in my pocket. I drove<br/>with Grushenka to Mokroe, a place twenty-five versts from here. I<br/>got Gypsies there and champagne and made all the peasants there<br/>drunk on it, and all the women and girls. I sent the thousands<br/>flying. In three days' time I was stripped bare, but a hero. Do you<br/>suppose the hero had gained his end? Not a sign of it from her. I<br/>tell you that rogue, Grushenka, has a supple curve all over her<br/>body. You can see it in her little foot, even in her little toe. I<br/>saw it, and kissed it, but that was all, I swear! 'I'll marry you<br/>if you like,' she said, 'you're a beggar, you know. Say that you<br/>won't beat me, and will let me do anything I choose, and perhaps I<br/>will marry you.' She laughed, and she's laughing still!"<br/><br/>Dmitri leapt up with a sort of fury. He seemed all at once as<br/>though he were drunk. His eyes became suddenly bloodshot.<br/><br/>"And do you really mean to marry her?"<br/><br/>"At once, if she will. And if she won't, I shall stay all the<br/>same. I'll be the porter at her gate. Alyosha!" he cried. He<br/>stopped short before him, and taking him by the shoulders began<br/>shaking him violently. "Do you know, you innocent boy, that this is<br/>all delirium, senseless delirium, for there's a tragedy here. Let<br/>me tell you, Alexey, that I may be a low man, with low and degraded<br/>passions, but a thief and a pickpocket Dmitri Karamazov never can<br/>be. Well, then; let me tell you that I am a thief and a pickpocket.<br/>That very morning, just before I went to beat Grushenka, Katerina<br/>Ivanovna sent for me, and in strict secrecy (why I don't know, I<br/>suppose she had some reason) asked me to go to the chief town of<br/>the province and to post three thousand roubles to Agafya Ivanovna<br/>in Moscow, so that nothing should be known of it in the town here.<br/>So I had that three thousand roubles in my pocket when I went to<br/>see Grushenka, and it was that money we spent at Mokroe. Afterwards<br/>I pretended I had been to the town, but did not show her the post<br/>office receipt. I said I had sent the money and would bring the<br/>receipt, and so far I haven't brought it. I've forgotten it. Now<br/>what do you think you're going to her to-day to say? 'He sends his<br/>compliments,' and she'll ask you, 'What about the money?' You might<br/>still have said to her, 'He's a degraded sensualist, and a low<br/>creature, with uncontrolled passions. He didn't send your money<br/>then, but wasted it, because, like a low brute, he couldn't control<br/>himself.' But still you might have added, 'He isn't a thief though.<br/>Here is your three thousand; he sends it back. Send it yourself to<br/>Agafya Ivanovna. But he told me to say "he sends his compliments."<br/>But, as it is, she will ask, 'But where is the money?'"<br/>
