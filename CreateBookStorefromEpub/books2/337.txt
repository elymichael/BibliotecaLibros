"I know, though you're a brute, you're generous," Grushenka
articulated with difficulty. "It must be honourable… it shall be
honourable for the future… and let us be honest, let us be good,
not brutes, but good… take me away, take me far away, do you hear?
I don't want it to be here, but far, far away… "

"Oh, yes, yes, it must be!" said Mitya, pressing her in his
arms. "I'll take you and we'll fly away… . Oh, I'd give my whole
life for one year only to know about that blood!"

"What blood?" asked Grushenka, bewildered.

"Nothing," muttered Mitya, through his teeth. "Grusha, you
wanted to be honest, but I'm a thief. But I've stolen money from
Katya… . Disgrace, a disgrace!"

"From Katya, from that young lady? No, you didn't steal it. Give
it back to her, take it from me… . Why make a fuss? Now everything
of mine is yours. What does money matter? We shall waste it anyway…
. Folks like us are bound to waste money. But we'd better go and
work the land. I want to dig the earth with my own hands. We must
work, do you hear? Alyosha said so. I won't be your mistress, I'll
be faithful to you, I'll be your slave, I'll work for you. We'll go
to the young lady and bow down to her together, so that she may
forgive us, and then we'll go away. And if she won't forgive us,
we'll go, anyway. Take her money and love me… . Don't love her… .
Don't love her any more. If you love her, I shall strangle her… .
I'll put out both her eyes with a needle… "

"I love you. love only you. I'll love you in Siberia… "

"Why Siberia? Never mind, Siberia, if you like. I don't care…
we'll work… there's snow in Siberia… . I love driving in the snow…
and must have bells… . Do you hear, there's a bell ringing? Where
is that bell ringing? There are people coming… . Now it's
stopped."

She closed her eyes, exhausted, and suddenly fell asleep for an
instant. There had certainly been the sound of a bell in the
distance, but the ringing had ceased. Mitya let his head sink on
her breast. He did not notice that the bell had ceased ringing, nor
did he notice that the songs had ceased, and that instead of
singing and drunken clamour there was absolute stillness in the
house. Grushenka opened her eyes.

"What's the matter? Was I asleep? Yes… a bell… I've been asleep
and dreamt I was driving over the snow with bells, and I dozed. I
was with someone I loved, with you. And far, far away. I was
holding you and kissing you, nestling close to you. I was cold, and
the snow glistened… . You know how the snow glistens at night when
the moon shines. It was as though I was not on earth. I woke up,
and my dear one is close to me. How sweet that is!… "

"Close to you," murmured Mitya, kissing her dress, her bosom,
her hands. And suddenly he had a strange fancy: it seemed to him
that she was looking straight before her, not at him, not into his
face, but over his head, with an intent, almost uncanny fixity. An
expression of wonder, almost of alarm, came suddenly into her
face.

"Mitya, who is that looking at us?" she whispered.
