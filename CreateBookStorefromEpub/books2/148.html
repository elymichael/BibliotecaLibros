<br/>A woman of genteel appearance, wearing a cotton gown, was<br/>sitting on a chair by the bed on the left. Her face was thin and<br/>yellow, and her sunken cheeks betrayed at the first glance that she<br/>was ill. But what struck Alyosha most was the expression in the<br/>poor woman's eyes- a look of surprised inquiry and yet of haughty<br/>pride. And while he was talking to her husband, her big brown eyes<br/>moved from one speaker to the other with the same haughty and<br/>questioning expression. Beside her at the window stood a young<br/>girl, rather plain, with scanty reddish hair, poorly but very<br/>neatly dressed. She looked disdainfully at Alyosha as he came in.<br/>Beside the other bed was sitting another female figure. She was a<br/>very sad sight, a young girl of about twenty, but hunchback and<br/>crippled "with withered legs," as Alyosha was told afterwards. Her<br/>crutches stood in the corner close by. The strikingly beautiful and<br/>gentle eyes of this poor girl looked with mild serenity at Alyosha.<br/>A man of forty-five was sitting at the table, finishing the fried<br/>eggs. He was spare, small, and weakly built. He had reddish hair<br/>and a scanty light-coloured beard, very much like a wisp of tow<br/>(this comparison and the phrase "a wisp of tow" flashed at once<br/>into Alyosha's mind for some reason, he remembered it afterwards).<br/>It was obviously this gentleman who had shouted to him, as there<br/>was no other man in the room. But when Alyosha went in, he leapt up<br/>from the bench on which he was sitting, and, hastily wiping his<br/>mouth with a ragged napkin, darted up to Alyosha.<br/><br/>"It's a monk come to beg for the monastery. A nice place to come<br/>to!" the girl standing in the left corner said aloud. The man spun<br/>round instantly towards her and answered her in an excited and<br/>breaking voice:<br/><br/>"No, Varvara, you are wrong. Allow me to ask," he turned again<br/>to Alyosha, "what has brought you to our retreat?"<br/><br/>Alyosha looked attentively at him. It was the first time he had<br/>seen him. There was something angular, flurried and irritable about<br/>him. Though he had obviously just been drinking, he was not drunk.<br/>There was extraordinary impudence in his expression, and yet,<br/>strange to say, at the same time there was fear. He looked like a<br/>man who had long been kept in subjection and had submitted to it,<br/>and now had suddenly turned and was trying to assert himself. Or,<br/>better still, like a man who wants dreadfully to hit you but is<br/>horribly afraid you will hit him. In his words and in the<br/>intonation of his shrill voice there was a sort of crazy humour, at<br/>times spiteful and at times cringing, and continually shifting from<br/>one tone to another. The question about "our retreat" he had asked,<br/>as it were, quivering all over, rolling his eyes, and skipping up<br/>so close to Alyosha that he instinctively drew back a step. He was<br/>dressed in a very shabby dark cotton coat, patched and spotted. He<br/>wore checked trousers of an extremely light colour, long out of<br/>fashion, and of very thin material. They were so crumpled and so<br/>short that he looked as though he had grown out of them like a<br/>boy.<br/><br/>"I am Alexey Karamazov," Alyosha began in reply.<br/><br/>"I quite understand that, sir," the gentleman snapped out at<br/>once to assure him that he knew who he was already. "I am Captain<br/>Snegiryov, sir, but I am still desirous to know precisely what has<br/>led you- "<br/><br/>"Oh, I've come for nothing special. I wanted to have a word with<br/>you- if only you allow me."<br/><br/>"In that case, here is a chair, sir; kindly be seated. That's<br/>what they used to say in the old comedies, 'kindly be seated,'" and<br/>with a rapid gesture he seized an empty chair (it was a rough<br/>wooden chair, not upholstered) and set it for him almost in the<br/>middle of the room; then, taking another similar chair for himself,<br/>he sat down facing Alyosha, so close to him that their knees almost<br/>touched.<br/><br/>"Nikolay Ilyitch Snegiryov, sir, formerly a captain in the<br/>Russian infantry, put to shame for his vices, but still a captain.<br/>Though I might not be one now for the way I talk; for the last half<br/>of my life I've learnt to say 'sir.' It's a word you use when<br/>you've come down in the world."<br/><br/>"That's very true," smiled Alyosha. "But is it used<br/>involuntarily or on purpose?"<br/><br/>
