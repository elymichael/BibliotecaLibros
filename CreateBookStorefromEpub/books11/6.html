<br/>After a pause, Lord Henry pulled out his watch. "I am afraid I<br/>must be going, Basil," he murmured, "and before I go, I insist on<br/>your answering a question I put to you some time ago."<br/><br/>"What is that?" said the painter, keeping his eyes fixed on the<br/>ground.<br/><br/>"You know quite well."<br/><br/>"I do not, Harry."<br/><br/>"Well, I will tell you what it is. I want you to explain to me<br/>why you won't exhibit Dorian Gray's picture. I want the real<br/>reason."<br/><br/>"I told you the real reason."<br/><br/>"No, you did not. You said it was because there was too much of<br/>yourself in it. Now, that is childish."<br/><br/>"Harry," said Basil Hallward, looking him straight in the face,<br/>"every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the<br/>artist, not of the sitter. The sitter is merely the accident, the<br/>occasion. It is not he who is revealed by the painter; it is rather<br/>the painter who, on the coloured canvas, reveals himself. The<br/>reason I will not exhibit this picture is that I am afraid that I<br/>have shown in it the secret of my own soul."<br/><br/>Lord Henry laughed. "And what is that?" he asked.<br/><br/>"I will tell you," said Hallward; but an expression of<br/>perplexity came over his face.<br/><br/>
