<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>18<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>The next day he did not leave the house, and, indeed, spent most<br/>of the time in his own room, sick with a wild terror of dying, and<br/>yet indifferent to life itself. The consciousness of being hunted,<br/>snared, tracked down, had begun to dominate him. If the tapestry<br/>did but tremble in the wind, he shook. The dead leaves that were<br/>blown against the leaded panes seemed to him like his own wasted<br/>resolutions and wild regrets. When he closed his eyes, he saw again<br/>the sailor's face peering through the mist-stained glass, and<br/>horror seemed once more to lay its hand upon his heart.<br/><br/>But perhaps it had been only his fancy that had called vengeance<br/>out of the night and set the hideous shapes of punishment before<br/>him. Actual life was chaos, but there was something terribly<br/>logical in the imagination. It was the imagination that set remorse<br/>to dog the feet of sin. It was the imagination that made each crime<br/>bear its misshapen brood. In the common world of fact the wicked<br/>were not punished, nor the good rewarded. Success was given to the<br/>strong, failure thrust upon the weak. That was all. Besides, had<br/>any stranger been prowling round the house, he would have been seen<br/>by the servants or the keepers. Had any foot-marks been found on<br/>the flower-beds, the gardeners would have reported it. Yes, it had<br/>been merely fancy. Sibyl Vane's brother had not come back to kill<br/>him. He had sailed away in his ship to founder in some winter sea.<br/>From him, at any rate, he was safe. Why, the man did not know who<br/>he was, could not know who he was. The mask of youth had saved<br/>him.<br/><br/>And yet if it had been merely an illusion, how terrible it was<br/>to think that conscience could raise such fearful phantoms, and<br/>give them visible form, and make them move before one! What sort of<br/>life would his be if, day and night, shadows of his crime were to<br/>peer at him from silent corners, to mock him from secret places, to<br/>whisper in his ear as he sat at the feast, to wake him with icy<br/>fingers as he lay asleep! As the thought crept through his brain,<br/>he grew pale with terror, and the air seemed to him to have become<br/>suddenly colder. Oh! in what a wild hour of madness he had killed<br/>his friend! How ghastly the mere memory of the scene! He saw it all<br/>again. Each hideous detail came back to him with added horror. Out<br/>of the black cave of time, terrible and swathed in scarlet, rose<br/>the image of his sin. When Lord Henry came in at six o'clock, he<br/>found him crying as one whose heart will break.<br/><br/>It was not till the third day that he ventured to go out. There<br/>was something in the clear, pine-scented air of that winter morning<br/>that seemed to bring him back his joyousness and his ardour for<br/>life. But it was not merely the physical conditions of environment<br/>that had caused the change. His own nature had revolted against the<br/>excess of anguish that had sought to maim and mar the perfection of<br/>its calm. With subtle and finely wrought temperaments it is always<br/>so. Their strong passions must either bruise or bend. They either<br/>slay the man, or themselves die. Shallow sorrows and shallow loves<br/>live on. The loves and sorrows that are great are destroyed by<br/>their own plenitude. Besides, he had convinced himself that he had<br/>been the victim of a terror-stricken imagination, and looked back<br/>now on his fears with something of pity and not a little of<br/>contempt.<br/><br/>After breakfast, he walked with the duchess for an hour in the<br/>garden and then drove across the park to join the shooting-party.<br/>The crisp frost lay like salt upon the grass. The sky was an<br/>inverted cup of blue metal. A thin film of ice bordered the flat,<br/>reed-grown lake.<br/><br/>At the corner of the pine-wood he caught sight of Sir Geoffrey<br/>Clouston, the duchess's brother, jerking two spent cartridges out<br/>of his gun. He jumped from the cart, and having told the groom to<br/>take the mare home, made his way towards his guest through the<br/>withered bracken and rough undergrowth.<br/><br/>
