"Hush, Alan. You have saved my life," said Dorian.

"Your life? Good heavens! what a life that is! You have gone
from corruption to corruption, and now you have culminated in
crime. In doing what I am going to do—what you force me to do— it
is not of your life that I am thinking."

"Ah, Alan," murmured Dorian with a sigh, "I wish you had a
thousandth part of the pity for me that I have for you." He turned
away as he spoke and stood looking out at the garden. Campbell made
no answer.

After about ten minutes a knock came to the door, and the
servant entered, carrying a large mahogany chest of chemicals, with
a long coil of steel and platinum wire and two rather curiously
shaped iron clamps.

"Shall I leave the things here, sir?" he asked Campbell.

"Yes," said Dorian. "And I am afraid, Francis, that I have
another errand for you. What is the name of the man at Richmond who
supplies Selby with orchids?"

"Harden, sir."

"Yes—Harden. You must go down to Richmond at once, see Harden
personally, and tell him to send twice as many orchids as I
ordered, and to have as few white ones as possible. In fact, I
don't want any white ones. It is a lovely day, Francis, and
Richmond is a very pretty place— otherwise I wouldn't bother you
about it."

"No trouble, sir. At what time shall I be back?"

Dorian looked at Campbell. "How long will your experiment take,
Alan?" he said in a calm indifferent voice. The presence of a third
person in the room seemed to give him extraordinary courage.

Campbell frowned and bit his lip. "It will take about five
hours," he answered.
