"Dorian," said Lord Henry, "I had better tell them that the
shooting is stopped for to-day. It would not look well to go
on."

"I wish it were stopped for ever, Harry," he answered bitterly.
"The whole thing is hideous and cruel. Is the man&#160;â€¦
&#160;?"

He could not finish the sentence.

"I am afraid so," rejoined Lord Henry. "He got the whole charge
of shot in his chest. He must have died almost instantaneously.
Come; let us go home."

They walked side by side in the direction of the avenue for
nearly fifty yards without speaking. Then Dorian looked at Lord
Henry and said, with a heavy sigh, "It is a bad omen, Harry, a very
bad omen."

"What is?" asked Lord Henry. "Oh! this accident, I suppose. My
dear fellow, it can't be helped. It was the man's own fault. Why
did he get in front of the guns? Besides, it is nothing to us. It
is rather awkward for Geoffrey, of course. It does not do to pepper
beaters. It makes people think that one is a wild shot. And
Geoffrey is not; he shoots very straight. But there is no use
talking about the matter."

Dorian shook his head. "It is a bad omen, Harry. I feel as if
something horrible were going to happen to some of us. To myself,
perhaps," he added, passing his hand over his eyes, with a gesture
of pain.

The elder man laughed. "The only horrible thing in the world is
ennui, Dorian. That is the one sin for which there is no
forgiveness. But we are not likely to suffer from it unless these
fellows keep chattering about this thing at dinner. I must tell
them that the subject is to be tabooed. As for omens, there is no
such thing as an omen. Destiny does not send us heralds. She is too
wise or too cruel for that. Besides, what on earth could happen to
you, Dorian? You have everything in the world that a man can want.
There is no one who would not be delighted to change places with
you."

"There is no one with whom I would not change places, Harry.
Don't laugh like that. I am telling you the truth. The wretched
peasant who has just died is better off than I am. I have no terror
of death. It is the coming of death that terrifies me. Its
monstrous wings seem to wheel in the leaden air around me. Good
heavens! don't you see a man moving behind the trees there,
watching me, waiting for me?"

Lord Henry looked in the direction in which the trembling gloved
hand was pointing. "Yes," he said, smiling, "I see the gardener
waiting for you. I suppose he wants to ask you what flowers you
wish to have on the table to-night. How absurdly nervous you are,
my dear fellow! You must come and see my doctor, when we get back
to town."
