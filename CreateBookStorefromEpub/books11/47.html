<br/>Yes, the lad was premature. He was gathering his harvest while<br/>it was yet spring. The pulse and passion of youth were in him, but<br/>he was becoming self-conscious. It was delightful to watch him.<br/>With his beautiful face, and his beautiful soul, he was a thing to<br/>wonder at. It was no matter how it all ended, or was destined to<br/>end. He was like one of those gracious figures in a pageant or a<br/>play, whose joys seem to be remote from one, but whose sorrows stir<br/>one's sense of beauty, and whose wounds are like red roses.<br/><br/>Soul and body, body and soulâ€”how mysterious they were! There was<br/>animalism in the soul, and the body had its moments of<br/>spirituality. The senses could refine, and the intellect could<br/>degrade. Who could say where the fleshly impulse ceased, or the<br/>psychical impulse began? How shallow were the arbitrary definitions<br/>of ordinary psychologists! And yet how difficult to decide between<br/>the claims of the various schools! Was the soul a shadow seated in<br/>the house of sin? Or was the body really in the soul, as Giordano<br/>Bruno thought? The separation of spirit from matter was a mystery,<br/>and the union of spirit with matter was a mystery also.<br/><br/>He began to wonder whether we could ever make psychology so<br/>absolute a science that each little spring of life would be<br/>revealed to us. As it was, we always misunderstood ourselves and<br/>rarely understood others. Experience was of no ethical value. It<br/>was merely the name men gave to their mistakes. Moralists had, as a<br/>rule, regarded it as a mode of warning, had claimed for it a<br/>certain ethical efficacy in the formation of character, had praised<br/>it as something that taught us what to follow and showed us what to<br/>avoid. But there was no motive power in experience. It was as<br/>little of an active cause as conscience itself. All that it really<br/>demonstrated was that our future would be the same as our past, and<br/>that the sin we had done once, and with loathing, we would do many<br/>times, and with joy.<br/><br/>It was clear to him that the experimental method was the only<br/>method by which one could arrive at any scientific analysis of the<br/>passions; and certainly Dorian Gray was a subject made to his hand,<br/>and seemed to promise rich and fruitful results. His sudden mad<br/>love for Sibyl Vane was a psychological phenomenon of no small<br/>interest. There was no doubt that curiosity had much to do with it,<br/>curiosity and the desire for new experiences, yet it was not a<br/>simple, but rather a very complex passion. What there was in it of<br/>the purely sensuous instinct of boyhood had been transformed by the<br/>workings of the imagination, changed into something that seemed to<br/>the lad himself to be remote from sense, and was for that very<br/>reason all the more dangerous. It was the passions about whose<br/>origin we deceived ourselves that tyrannized most strongly over us.<br/>Our weakest motives were those of whose nature we were conscious.<br/>It often happened that when we thought we were experimenting on<br/>others we were really experimenting on ourselves.<br/><br/>While Lord Henry sat dreaming on these things, a knock came to<br/>the door, and his valet entered and reminded him it was time to<br/>dress for dinner. He got up and looked out into the street. The<br/>sunset had smitten into scarlet gold the upper windows of the<br/>houses opposite. The panes glowed like plates of heated metal. The<br/>sky above was like a faded rose. He thought of his friend's young<br/>fiery-coloured life and wondered how it was all going to end.<br/><br/>When he arrived home, about half-past twelve o'clock, he saw a<br/>telegram lying on the hall table. He opened it and found it was<br/>from Dorian Gray. It was to tell him that he was engaged to be<br/>married to Sibyl Vane.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
