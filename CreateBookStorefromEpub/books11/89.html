But there was no other place in the house so secure from prying<br/>eyes as this. He had the key, and no one else could enter it.<br/>Beneath its purple pall, the face painted on the canvas could grow<br/>bestial, sodden, and unclean. What did it matter? No one could see<br/>it. He himself would not see it. Why should he watch the hideous<br/>corruption of his soul? He kept his youth— that was enough. And,<br/>besides, might not his nature grow finer, after all? There was no<br/>reason that the future should be so full of shame. Some love might<br/>come across his life, and purify him, and shield him from those<br/>sins that seemed to be already stirring in spirit and in flesh—<br/>those curious unpictured sins whose very mystery lent them their<br/>subtlety and their charm. Perhaps, some day, the cruel look would<br/>have passed away from the scarlet sensitive mouth, and he might<br/>show to the world Basil Hallward's masterpiece.<br/><br/>No; that was impossible. Hour by hour, and week by week, the<br/>thing upon the canvas was growing old. It might escape the<br/>hideousness of sin, but the hideousness of age was in store for it.<br/>The cheeks would become hollow or flaccid. Yellow crow's feet would<br/>creep round the fading eyes and make them horrible. The hair would<br/>lose its brightness, the mouth would gape or droop, would be<br/>foolish or gross, as the mouths of old men are. There would be the<br/>wrinkled throat, the cold, blue-veined hands, the twisted body,<br/>that he remembered in the grandfather who had been so stern to him<br/>in his boyhood. The picture had to be concealed. There was no help<br/>for it.<br/><br/>"Bring it in, Mr. Hubbard, please," he said, wearily, turning<br/>round. "I am sorry I kept you so long. I was thinking of something<br/>else."<br/><br/>"Always glad to have a rest, Mr. Gray," answered the<br/>frame-maker, who was still gasping for breath. "Where shall we put<br/>it, sir?"<br/><br/>"Oh, anywhere. Here: this will do. I don't want to have it hung<br/>up. Just lean it against the wall. Thanks."<br/><br/>"Might one look at the work of art, sir?"<br/><br/>Dorian started. "It would not interest you, Mr. Hubbard," he<br/>said, keeping his eye on the man. He felt ready to leap upon him<br/>and fling him to the ground if he dared to lift the gorgeous<br/>hanging that concealed the secret of his life. "I shan't trouble<br/>you any more now. I am much obliged for your kindness in coming<br/>round."<br/><br/>"Not at all, not at all, Mr. Gray. Ever ready to do anything for<br/>you, sir." And Mr. Hubbard tramped downstairs, followed by the<br/>assistant, who glanced back at Dorian with a look of shy wonder in<br/>his rough uncomely face. He had never seen any one so<br/>marvellous.<br/><br/>When the sound of their footsteps had died away, Dorian locked<br/>the door and put the key in his pocket. He felt safe now. No one<br/>would ever look upon the horrible thing. No eye but his would ever<br/>see his shame.<br/><br/>On reaching the library, he found that it was just after five<br/>o'clock and that the tea had been already brought up. On a little<br/>table of dark perfumed wood thickly incrusted with nacre, a present<br/>from Lady Radley, his guardian's wife, a pretty professional<br/>invalid who had spent the preceding winter in Cairo, was lying a<br/>note from Lord Henry, and beside it was a book bound in yellow<br/>paper, the cover slightly torn and the edges soiled. A copy of the<br/>third edition of The St. James's Gazette had been placed on the<br/>tea-tray. It was evident that Victor had returned. He wondered if<br/>he had met the men in the hall as they were leaving the house and<br/>had wormed out of them what they had been doing. He would be sure<br/>to miss the picture—had no doubt missed it already, while he had<br/>been laying the tea-things. The screen had not been set back, and a<br/>blank space was visible on the wall. Perhaps some night he might<br/>find him creeping upstairs and trying to force the door of the<br/>room. It was a horrible thing to have a spy in one's house. He had<br/>heard of rich men who had been blackmailed all their lives by some<br/>servant who had read a letter, or overheard a conversation, or<br/>picked up a card with an address, or found beneath a pillow a<br/>withered flower or a shred of crumpled lace.<br/><br/>He sighed, and having poured himself out some tea, opened Lord<br/>Henry's note. It was simply to say that he sent him round the<br/>evening paper, and a book that might interest him, and that he<br/>would be at the club at eight-fifteen. He opened The St. James's<br/>languidly, and looked through it. A red pencil-mark on the fifth<br/>page caught his eye. It drew attention to the following<br/>paragraph:<br/>
