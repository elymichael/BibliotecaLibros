"Mr. Hallward, sir. He stayed here till eleven, and then be went

"No, sir, except that he would write to you from Paris, if he
did not find you at the club."

"That will do, Francis. Don't forget to call me at nine
to-morrow."

"No, sir."

"Alan Campbell, 152, Hertford Street, Mayfair." Yes; that was the
man he wanted.
