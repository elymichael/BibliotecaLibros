"Come, Alan, you must decide at once."

"I cannot do it," he said, mechanically, as though words could
alter things.

"You must. You have no choice. Don't delay."

He hesitated a moment. "Is there a fire in the room
upstairs?"

"Yes, there is a gas-fire with asbestos."

"I shall have to go home and get some things from the
laboratory."

"No, Alan, you must not leave the house. Write out on a sheet of
notepaper what you want and my servant will take a cab and bring
the things back to you."

Campbell scrawled a few lines, blotted them, and addressed an
envelope to his assistant. Dorian took the note up and read it
carefully. Then he rang the bell and gave it to his valet, with
orders to return as soon as possible and to bring the things with
him.

As the hall door shut, Campbell started nervously, and having
got up from the chair, went over to the chimney-piece. He was
shivering with a kind of ague. For nearly twenty minutes, neither
of the men spoke. A fly buzzed noisily about the room, and the
ticking of the clock was like the beat of a hammer.

As the chime struck one, Campbell turned round, and looking at
Dorian Gray, saw that his eyes were filled with tears. There was
something in the purity and refinement of that sad face that seemed
to enrage him. "You are infamous, absolutely infamous!" he
muttered.
