Dorian heaved a sigh of relief as he saw the gardener<br/>approaching. The man touched his hat, glanced for a moment at Lord<br/>Henry in a hesitating manner, and then produced a letter, which he<br/>handed to his master. "Her Grace told me to wait for an answer," he<br/>murmured.<br/><br/>Dorian put the letter into his pocket. "Tell her Grace that I am<br/>coming in," he said, coldly. The man turned round and went rapidly<br/>in the direction of the house.<br/><br/>"How fond women are of doing dangerous things!" laughed Lord<br/>Henry. "It is one of the qualities in them that I admire most. A<br/>woman will flirt with anybody in the world as long as other people<br/>are looking on."<br/><br/>"How fond you are of saying dangerous things, Harry! In the<br/>present instance, you are quite astray. I like the duchess very<br/>much, but I don't love her."<br/><br/>"And the duchess loves you very much, but she likes you less, so<br/>you are excellently matched."<br/><br/>"You are talking scandal, Harry, and there is never any basis<br/>for scandal."<br/><br/>"The basis of every scandal is an immoral certainty," said Lord<br/>Henry, lighting a cigarette.<br/><br/>"You would sacrifice anybody, Harry, for the sake of an<br/>epigram."<br/><br/>"The world goes to the altar of its own accord," was the<br/>answer.<br/><br/>"I wish I could love," cried Dorian Gray with a deep note of<br/>pathos in his voice. "But I seem to have lost the passion and<br/>forgotten the desire. I am too much concentrated on myself. My own<br/>personality has become a burden to me. I want to escape, to go<br/>away, to forget. It was silly of me to come down here at all. I<br/>think I shall send a wire to Harvey to have the yacht got ready. On<br/>a yacht one is safe."<br/><br/>"Safe from what, Dorian? You are in some trouble. Why not tell<br/>me what it is? You know I would help you."<br/>
