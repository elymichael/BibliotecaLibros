He winced at the mention of his grandfather. He had hateful<br/>memories of him. "That does not matter," he answered. "I simply<br/>want to see the place— that is all. Give me the key."<br/><br/>"And here is the key, sir," said the old lady, going over the<br/>contents of her bunch with tremulously uncertain hands. "Here is<br/>the key. I'll have it off the bunch in a moment. But you don't<br/>think of living up there, sir, and you so comfortable here?"<br/><br/>"No, no," he cried petulantly. "Thank you, Leaf. That will<br/>do."<br/><br/>She lingered for a few moments, and was garrulous over some<br/>detail of the household. He sighed and told her to manage things as<br/>she thought best. She left the room, wreathed in smiles.<br/><br/>As the door closed, Dorian put the key in his pocket and looked<br/>round the room. His eye fell on a large, purple satin coverlet<br/>heavily embroidered with gold, a splendid piece of late<br/>seventeenth-century Venetian work that his grandfather had found in<br/>a convent near Bologna. Yes, that would serve to wrap the dreadful<br/>thing in. It had perhaps served often as a pall for the dead. Now<br/>it was to hide something that had a corruption of its own, worse<br/>than the corruption of death itself— something that would breed<br/>horrors and yet would never die. What the worm was to the corpse,<br/>his sins would be to the painted image on the canvas. They would<br/>mar its beauty and eat away its grace. They would defile it and<br/>make it shameful. And yet the thing would still live on. It would<br/>be always alive.<br/><br/>He shuddered, and for a moment he regretted that he had not told<br/>Basil the true reason why he had wished to hide the picture away.<br/>Basil would have helped him to resist Lord Henry's influence, and<br/>the still more poisonous influences that came from his own<br/>temperament. The love that he bore him—for it was really love— had<br/>nothing in it that was not noble and intellectual. It was not that<br/>mere physical admiration of beauty that is born of the senses and<br/>that dies when the senses tire. It was such love as Michelangelo<br/>had known, and Montaigne, and Winckelmann, and Shakespeare himself.<br/>Yes, Basil could have saved him. But it was too late now. The past<br/>could always be annihilated. Regret, denial, or forgetfulness could<br/>do that. But the future was inevitable. There were passions in him<br/>that would find their terrible outlet, dreams that would make the<br/>shadow of their evil real.<br/><br/>He took up from the couch the great purple-and-gold texture that<br/>covered it, and, holding it in his hands, passed behind the screen.<br/>Was the face on the canvas viler than before? It seemed to him that<br/>it was unchanged, and yet his loathing of it was intensified. Gold<br/>hair, blue eyes, and rose-red lips—they all were there. It was<br/>simply the expression that had altered. That was horrible in its<br/>cruelty. Compared to what he saw in it of censure or rebuke, how<br/>shallow Basil's reproaches about Sibyl Vane had been!— how shallow,<br/>and of what little account! His own soul was looking out at him<br/>from the canvas and calling him to judgement. A look of pain came<br/>across him, and he flung the rich pall over the picture. As he did<br/>so, a knock came to the door. He passed out as his servant<br/>entered.<br/><br/>"The persons are here, Monsieur."<br/><br/>He felt that the man must be got rid of at once. He must not be<br/>allowed to know where the picture was being taken to. There was<br/>something sly about him, and he had thoughtful, treacherous eyes.<br/>Sitting down at the writing-table he scribbled a note to Lord<br/>Henry, asking him to send him round something to read and reminding<br/>him that they were to meet at eight-fifteen that evening.<br/><br/>"Wait for an answer," he said, handing it to him, "and show the<br/>men in here."<br/><br/>In two or three minutes there was another knock, and Mr. Hubbard<br/>himself, the celebrated frame-maker of South Audley Street, came in<br/>with a somewhat rough-looking young assistant. Mr. Hubbard was a<br/>florid, red-whiskered little man, whose admiration for art was<br/>considerably tempered by the inveterate impecuniosity of most of<br/>the artists who dealt with him. As a rule, he never left his shop.<br/>He waited for people to come to him. But he always made an<br/>exception in favour of Dorian Gray. There was something about<br/>Dorian that charmed everybody. It was a pleasure even to see<br/>him.<br/>
