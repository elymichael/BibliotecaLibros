<br/>"What can I do for you, Mr. Gray?" he said, rubbing his fat<br/>freckled hands. "I thought I would do myself the honour of coming<br/>round in person. I have just got a beauty of a frame, sir. Picked<br/>it up at a sale. Old Florentine. Came from Fonthill, I believe.<br/>Admirably suited for a religious subject, Mr. Gray."<br/><br/>"I am so sorry you have given yourself the trouble of coming<br/>round, Mr. Hubbard. I shall certainly drop in and look at the<br/>frame— though I don't go in much at present for religious art—but<br/>to-day I only want a picture carried to the top of the house for<br/>me. It is rather heavy, so I thought I would ask you to lend me a<br/>couple of your men."<br/><br/>"No trouble at all, Mr. Gray. I am delighted to be of any<br/>service to you. Which is the work of art, sir?"<br/><br/>"This," replied Dorian, moving the screen back. "Can you move<br/>it, covering and all, just as it is? I don't want it to get<br/>scratched going upstairs."<br/><br/>"There will be no difficulty, sir," said the genial frame-maker,<br/>beginning, with the aid of his assistant, to unhook the picture<br/>from the long brass chains by which it was suspended. "And, now,<br/>where shall we carry it to, Mr. Gray?"<br/><br/>"I will show you the way, Mr. Hubbard, if you will kindly follow<br/>me. Or perhaps you had better go in front. I am afraid it is right<br/>at the top of the house. We will go up by the front staircase, as<br/>it is wider."<br/><br/>He held the door open for them, and they passed out into the<br/>hall and began the ascent. The elaborate character of the frame had<br/>made the picture extremely bulky, and now and then, in spite of the<br/>obsequious protests of Mr. Hubbard, who had the true tradesman's<br/>spirited dislike of seeing a gentleman doing anything useful,<br/>Dorian put his hand to it so as to help them.<br/><br/>"Something of a load to carry, sir," gasped the little man when<br/>they reached the top landing. And he wiped his shiny forehead.<br/><br/>"I am afraid it is rather heavy," murmured Dorian as he unlocked<br/>the door that opened into the room that was to keep for him the<br/>curious secret of his life and hide his soul from the eyes of<br/>men.<br/><br/>He had not entered the place for more than four years—not,<br/>indeed, since he had used it first as a play-room when he was a<br/>child, and then as a study when he grew somewhat older. It was a<br/>large, well-proportioned room, which had been specially built by<br/>the last Lord Kelso for the use of the little grandson whom, for<br/>his strange likeness to his mother, and also for other reasons, he<br/>had always hated and desired to keep at a distance. It appeared to<br/>Dorian to have but little changed. There was the huge Italian<br/>cassone, with its fantastically painted panels and its tarnished<br/>gilt mouldings, in which he had so often hidden himself as a boy.<br/>There the satinwood book-case filled with his dog-eared<br/>schoolbooks. On the wall behind it was hanging the same ragged<br/>Flemish tapestry where a faded king and queen were playing chess in<br/>a garden, while a company of hawkers rode by, carrying hooded birds<br/>on their gauntleted wrists. How well he remembered it all! Every<br/>moment of his lonely childhood came back to him as he looked round.<br/>He recalled the stainless purity of his boyish life, and it seemed<br/>horrible to him that it was here the fatal portrait was to be<br/>hidden away. How little he had thought, in those dead days, of all<br/>that was in store for him!<br/><br/>
