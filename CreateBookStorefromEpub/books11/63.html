"I should have said that whatever they ask for they had first<br/>given to us," murmured the lad gravely. "They create love in our<br/>natures. They have a right to demand it back."<br/><br/>"That is quite true, Dorian," cried Hallward.<br/><br/>"Nothing is ever quite true," said Lord Henry.<br/><br/>"This is," interrupted Dorian. "You must admit, Harry, that<br/>women give to men the very gold of their lives."<br/><br/>"Possibly," he sighed, "but they invariably want it back in such<br/>very small change. That is the worry. Women, as some witty<br/>Frenchman once put it, inspire us with the desire to do<br/>masterpieces and always prevent us from carrying them out."<br/><br/>"Harry, you are dreadful! I don't know why I like you so<br/>much."<br/><br/>"You will always like me, Dorian," he replied. "Will you have<br/>some coffee, you fellows? Waiter, bring coffee, and fine-champagne,<br/>and some cigarettes. No, don't mind the cigarettes—I have some.<br/>Basil, I can't allow you to smoke cigars. You must have a<br/>cigarette. A cigarette is the perfect type of a perfect pleasure.<br/>It is exquisite, and it leaves one unsatisfied. What more can one<br/>want? Yes, Dorian, you will always be fond of me. I represent to<br/>you all the sins you have never had the courage to commit."<br/><br/>"What nonsense you talk, Harry!" cried the lad, taking a light<br/>from a fire-breathing silver dragon that the waiter had placed on<br/>the table. "Let us go down to the theatre. When Sibyl comes on the<br/>stage you will have a new ideal of life. She will represent<br/>something to you that you have never known."<br/><br/>"I have known everything," said Lord Henry, with a tired look in<br/>his eyes, "but I am always ready for a new emotion. I am afraid,<br/>however, that, for me at any rate, there is no such thing. Still,<br/>your wonderful girl may thrill me. I love acting. It is so much<br/>more real than life. Let us go. Dorian, you will come with me. I am<br/>so sorry, Basil, but there is only room for two in the brougham.<br/>You must follow us in a hansom."<br/><br/>They got up and put on their coats, sipping their coffee<br/>standing. The painter was silent and preoccupied. There was a gloom<br/>over him. He could not bear this marriage, and yet it seemed to him<br/>to be better than many other things that might have happened. After<br/>a few minutes, they all passed downstairs. He drove off by himself,<br/>as had been arranged, and watched the flashing lights of the little<br/>brougham in front of him. A strange sense of loss came over him. He<br/>felt that Dorian Gray would never again be to him all that he had<br/>been in the past. Life had come between them… . His eyes darkened,<br/>and the crowded flaring streets became blurred to his eyes. When<br/>the cab drew up at the theatre, it seemed to him that he had grown<br/>years older.<br/><br/><br/>
