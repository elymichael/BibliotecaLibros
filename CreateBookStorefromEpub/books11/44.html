"You don't understand her, Harry. She regarded me merely as a<br/>person in a play. She knows nothing of life. She lives with her<br/>mother, a faded tired woman who played Lady Capulet in a sort of<br/>magenta dressing-wrapper on the first night, and looks as if she<br/>had seen better days."<br/><br/>"I know that look. It depresses me," murmured Lord Henry,<br/>examining his rings.<br/><br/>"The Jew wanted to tell me her history, but I said it did not<br/>interest me."<br/><br/>"You were quite right. There is always something infinitely mean<br/>about other people's tragedies."<br/><br/>"Sibyl is the only thing I care about. What is it to me where<br/>she came from? From her little head to her little feet, she is<br/>absolutely and entirely divine. Every night of my life I go to see<br/>her act, and every night she is more marvellous."<br/><br/>"That is the reason, I suppose, that you never dine with me now.<br/>I thought you must have some curious romance on hand. You have; but<br/>it is not quite what I expected."<br/><br/>"My dear Harry, we either lunch or sup together every day, and I<br/>have been to the opera with you several times," said Dorian,<br/>opening his blue eyes in wonder.<br/><br/>"You always come dreadfully late."<br/><br/>"Well, I can't help going to see Sibyl play," he cried, "even if<br/>it is only for a single act. I get hungry for her presence; and<br/>when I think of the wonderful soul that is hidden away in that<br/>little ivory body, I am filled with awe."<br/><br/>"You can dine with me to-night, Dorian, can't you?"<br/><br/>He shook his head. "To-night she is Imogen," he answered, "and<br/>to-morrow night she will be Juliet."<br/>
