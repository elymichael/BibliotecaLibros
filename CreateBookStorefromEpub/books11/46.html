"Let me see. To-day is Tuesday. Let us fix to-morrow. She plays<br/>Juliet to-morrow."<br/><br/>"All right. The Bristol at eight o'clock; and I will get<br/>Basil."<br/><br/>"Not eight, Harry, please. Half-past six. We must be there<br/>before the curtain rises. You must see her in the first act, where<br/>she meets Romeo."<br/><br/>"Half-past six! What an hour! It will be like having a meat-tea,<br/>or reading an English novel. It must be seven. No gentleman dines<br/>before seven. Shall you see Basil between this and then? Or shall I<br/>write to him?"<br/><br/>"Dear Basil! I have not laid eyes on him for a week. It is<br/>rather horrid of me, as he has sent me my portrait in the most<br/>wonderful frame, specially designed by himself, and, though I am a<br/>little jealous of the picture for being a whole month younger than<br/>I am, I must admit that I delight in it. Perhaps you had better<br/>write to him. I don't want to see him alone. He says things that<br/>annoy me. He gives me good advice."<br/><br/>Lord Henry smiled. "People are very fond of giving away what<br/>they need most themselves. It is what I call the depth of<br/>generosity."<br/><br/>"Oh, Basil is the best of fellows, but he seems to me to be just<br/>a bit of a Philistine. Since I have known you, Harry, I have<br/>discovered that."<br/><br/>"Basil, my dear boy, puts everything that is charming in him<br/>into his work. The consequence is that he has nothing left for life<br/>but his prejudices, his principles, and his common sense. The only<br/>artists I have ever known who are personally delightful are bad<br/>artists. Good artists exist simply in what they make, and<br/>consequently are perfectly uninteresting in what they are. A great<br/>poet, a really great poet, is the most unpoetical of all creatures.<br/>But inferior poets are absolutely fascinating. The worse their<br/>rhymes are, the more picturesque they look. The mere fact of having<br/>published a book of second-rate sonnets makes a man quite<br/>irresistible. He lives the poetry that he cannot write. The others<br/>write the poetry that they dare not realize."<br/><br/>"I wonder is that really so, Harry?" said Dorian Gray, putting<br/>some perfume on his handkerchief out of a large, gold-topped bottle<br/>that stood on the table. "It must be, if you say it. And now I am<br/>off. Imogen is waiting for me. Don't forget about to-morrow.<br/>Good-bye."<br/><br/>As he left the room, Lord Henry's heavy eyelids drooped, and he<br/>began to think. Certainly few people had ever interested him so<br/>much as Dorian Gray, and yet the lad's mad adoration of some one<br/>else caused him not the slightest pang of annoyance or jealousy. He<br/>was pleased by it. It made him a more interesting study. He had<br/>been always enthralled by the methods of natural science, but the<br/>ordinary subject-matter of that science had seemed to him trivial<br/>and of no import. And so he had begun by vivisecting himself, as he<br/>had ended by vivisecting others. Human life—that appeared to him<br/>the one thing worth investigating. Compared to it there was nothing<br/>else of any value. It was true that as one watched life in its<br/>curious crucible of pain and pleasure, one could not wear over<br/>one's face a mask of glass, nor keep the sulphurous fumes from<br/>troubling the brain and making the imagination turbid with<br/>monstrous fancies and misshapen dreams. There were poisons so<br/>subtle that to know their properties one had to sicken of them.<br/>There were maladies so strange that one had to pass through them if<br/>one sought to understand their nature. And, yet, what a great<br/>reward one received! How wonderful the whole world became to one!<br/>To note the curious hard logic of passion, and the emotional<br/>coloured life of the intellect—to observe where they met, and where<br/>they separated, at what point they were in unison, and at what<br/>point they were at discord—there was a delight in that! What matter<br/>what the cost was? One could never pay too high a price for any<br/>sensation.<br/><br/>He was conscious—and the thought brought a gleam of pleasure<br/>into his brown agate eyes—that it was through certain words of his,<br/>musical words said with musical utterance, that Dorian Gray's soul<br/>had turned to this white girl and bowed in worship before her. To a<br/>large extent the lad was his own creation. He had made him<br/>premature. That was something. Ordinary people waited till life<br/>disclosed to them its secrets, but to the few, to the elect, the<br/>mysteries of life were revealed before the veil was drawn away.<br/>Sometimes this was the effect of art, and chiefly of the art of<br/>literature, which dealt immediately with the passions and the<br/>intellect. But now and then a complex personality took the place<br/>and assumed the office of art, was indeed, in its way, a real work<br/>of art, life having its elaborate masterpieces, just as poetry has,<br/>or sculpture, or painting.<br/>
