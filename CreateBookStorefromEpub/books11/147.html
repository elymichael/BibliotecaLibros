"Have you had good sport, Geoffrey?" he asked.<br/><br/>"Not very good, Dorian. I think most of the birds have gone to<br/>the open. I dare say it will be better after lunch, when we get to<br/>new ground."<br/><br/>Dorian strolled along by his side. The keen aromatic air, the<br/>brown and red lights that glimmered in the wood, the hoarse cries<br/>of the beaters ringing out from time to time, and the sharp snaps<br/>of the guns that followed, fascinated him and filled him with a<br/>sense of delightful freedom. He was dominated by the carelessness<br/>of happiness, by the high indifference of joy.<br/><br/>Suddenly from a lumpy tussock of old grass some twenty yards in<br/>front of them, with black-tipped ears erect and long hinder limbs<br/>throwing it forward, started a hare. It bolted for a thicket of<br/>alders. Sir Geoffrey put his gun to his shoulder, but there was<br/>something in the animal's grace of movement that strangely charmed<br/>Dorian Gray, and he cried out at once, "Don't shoot it, Geoffrey.<br/>Let it live."<br/><br/>"What nonsense, Dorian!" laughed his companion, and as the hare<br/>bounded into the thicket, he fired. There were two cries heard, the<br/>cry of a hare in pain, which is dreadful, the cry of a man in<br/>agony, which is worse.<br/><br/>"Good heavens! I have hit a beater!" exclaimed Sir Geoffrey.<br/>"What an ass the man was to get in front of the guns! Stop shooting<br/>there!" he called out at the top of his voice. "A man is hurt."<br/><br/>The head-keeper came running up with a stick in his hand.<br/><br/>"Where, sir? Where is he?" he shouted. At the same time, the<br/>firing ceased along the line.<br/><br/>"Here," answered Sir Geoffrey angrily, hurrying towards the<br/>thicket. "Why on earth don't you keep your men back? Spoiled my<br/>shooting for the day."<br/><br/>Dorian watched them as they plunged into the alder-clump,<br/>brushing the lithe swinging branches aside. In a few moments they<br/>emerged, dragging a body after them into the sunlight. He turned<br/>away in horror. It seemed to him that misfortune followed wherever<br/>he went. He heard Sir Geoffrey ask if the man was really dead, and<br/>the affirmative answer of the keeper. The wood seemed to him to<br/>have become suddenly alive with faces. There was the trampling of<br/>myriad feet and the low buzz of voices. A great copper-breasted<br/>pheasant came beating through the boughs overhead.<br/><br/>After a few moments—that were to him, in his perturbed state,<br/>like endless hours of pain—he felt a hand laid on his shoulder. He<br/>started and looked round.<br/>
