Dorian heaved a sigh, and Lord Henry strolled across the room
and began to stroke the head of a curious Java parrot, a large,
grey-plumaged bird with pink crest and tail, that was balancing
itself upon a bamboo perch. As his pointed fingers touched it, it
dropped the white scurf of crinkled lids over black, glasslike eyes
and began to sway backwards and forwards.

"Yes," he continued, turning round and taking his handkerchief
out of his pocket; "his painting had quite gone off. It seemed to
me to have lost something. It had lost an ideal. When you and he
ceased to be great friends, he ceased to be a great artist. What
was it separated you? I suppose he bored you. If so, he never
forgave you. It's a habit bores have. By the way, what has become
of that wonderful portrait he did of you? I don't think I have ever
seen it since he finished it. Oh! I remember your telling me years
ago that you had sent it down to Selby, and that it had got mislaid
or stolen on the way. You never got it back? What a pity! it was
really a masterpiece. I remember I wanted to buy it. I wish I had
now. It belonged to Basil's best period. Since then, his work was
that curious mixture of bad painting and good intentions that
always entitles a man to be called a representative British artist.
Did you advertise for it? You should."

"I forget," said Dorian. "I suppose I did. But I never really
liked it. I am sorry I sat for it. The memory of the thing is
hateful to me. Why do you talk of it? It used to remind me of those
curious lines in some play—Hamlet, I think—how do they run?— "Like
the painting of a sorrow, A face without a heart."

Yes: that is what it was like."

Lord Henry laughed. "If a man treats life artistically, his
brain is his heart," he answered, sinking into an arm-chair.

Dorian Gray shook his head and struck some soft chords on the
piano. "'Like the painting of a sorrow,'" he repeated, "'a face
without a heart.'"

The elder man lay back and looked at him with half-closed eyes.
"By the way, Dorian," he said after a pause, "'what does it profit
a man if he gain the whole world and lose—how does the quotation
run?— his own soul'?"

The music jarred, and Dorian Gray started and stared at his
friend. "Why do you ask me that, Harry?"

"My dear fellow," said Lord Henry, elevating his eyebrows in
surprise, "I asked you because I thought you might be able to give
me an answer. That is all. I was going through the park last
Sunday, and close by the Marble Arch there stood a little crowd of
shabby-looking people listening to some vulgar street-preacher. As
I passed by, I heard the man yelling out that question to his
audience. It struck me as being rather dramatic. London is very
rich in curious effects of that kind. A wet Sunday, an uncouth
Christian in a mackintosh, a ring of sickly white faces under a
broken roof of dripping umbrellas, and a wonderful phrase flung
into the air by shrill hysterical lips—it was really very good in
its way, quite a suggestion. I thought of telling the prophet that
art had a soul, but that man had not. I am afraid, however, he
would not have understood me."

"Don't, Harry. The soul is a terrible reality. It can be bought,
and sold, and bartered away. It can be poisoned, or made perfect.
There is a soul in each one of us. I know it."

"Do you feel quite sure of that, Dorian?"
