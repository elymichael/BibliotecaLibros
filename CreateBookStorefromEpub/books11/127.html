Then they passed by lonely brickfields. The fog was lighter<br/>here, and he could see the strange, bottle-shaped kilns with their<br/>orange, fanlike tongues of fire. A dog barked as they went by, and<br/>far away in the darkness some wandering sea-gull screamed. The<br/>horse stumbled in a rut, then swerved aside and broke into a<br/>gallop.<br/><br/>After some time they left the clay road and rattled again over<br/>rough-paven streets. Most of the windows were dark, but now and<br/>then fantastic shadows were silhouetted against some lamplit blind.<br/>He watched them curiously. They moved like monstrous marionettes<br/>and made gestures like live things. He hated them. A dull rage was<br/>in his heart. As they turned a corner, a woman yelled something at<br/>them from an open door, and two men ran after the hansom for about<br/>a hundred yards. The driver beat at them with his whip.<br/><br/>It is said that passion makes one think in a circle. Certainly<br/>with hideous iteration the bitten lips of Dorian Gray shaped and<br/>reshaped those subtle words that dealt with soul and sense, till he<br/>had found in them the full expression, as it were, of his mood, and<br/>justified, by intellectual approval, passions that without such<br/>justification would still have dominated his temper. From cell to<br/>cell of his brain crept the one thought; and the wild desire to<br/>live, most terrible of all man's appetites, quickened into force<br/>each trembling nerve and fibre. Ugliness that had once been hateful<br/>to him because it made things real, became dear to him now for that<br/>very reason. Ugliness was the one reality. The coarse brawl, the<br/>loathsome den, the crude violence of disordered life, the very<br/>vileness of thief and outcast, were more vivid, in their intense<br/>actuality of impression, than all the gracious shapes of art, the<br/>dreamy shadows of song. They were what he needed for forgetfulness.<br/>In three days he would be free.<br/><br/>Suddenly the man drew up with a jerk at the top of a dark lane.<br/>Over the low roofs and jagged chimney-stacks of the houses rose the<br/>black masts of ships. Wreaths of white mist clung like ghostly<br/>sails to the yards.<br/><br/>"Somewhere about here, sir, ain't it?" he asked huskily through<br/>the trap.<br/><br/>Dorian started and peered round. "This will do," he answered,<br/>and having got out hastily and given the driver the extra fare he<br/>had promised him, he walked quickly in the direction of the quay.<br/>Here and there a lantern gleamed at the stern of some huge<br/>merchantman. The light shook and splintered in the puddles. A red<br/>glare came from an outward-bound steamer that was coaling. The<br/>slimy pavement looked like a wet mackintosh.<br/><br/>He hurried on towards the left, glancing back now and then to<br/>see if he was being followed. In about seven or eight minutes he<br/>reached a small shabby house that was wedged in between two gaunt<br/>factories. In one of the top-windows stood a lamp. He stopped and<br/>gave a peculiar knock.<br/><br/>After a little time he heard steps in the passage and the chain<br/>being unhooked. The door opened quietly, and he went in without<br/>saying a word to the squat misshapen figure that flattened itself<br/>into the shadow as he passed. At the end of the hall hung a<br/>tattered green curtain that swayed and shook in the gusty wind<br/>which had followed him in from the street. He dragged it aside and<br/>entered a long low room which looked as if it had once been a<br/>third-rate dancing-saloon. Shrill flaring gas-jets, dulled and<br/>distorted in the fly-blown mirrors that faced them, were ranged<br/>round the walls. Greasy reflectors of ribbed tin backed them,<br/>making quivering disks of light. The floor was covered with<br/>ochre-coloured sawdust, trampled here and there into mud, and<br/>stained with dark rings of spilled liquor. Some Malays were<br/>crouching by a little charcoal stove, playing with bone counters<br/>and showing their white teeth as they chattered. In one corner,<br/>with his head buried in his arms, a sailor sprawled over a table,<br/>and by the tawdrily painted bar that ran across one complete side<br/>stood two haggard women, mocking an old man who was brushing the<br/>sleeves of his coat with an expression of disgust. "He thinks he's<br/>got red ants on him," laughed one of them, as Dorian passed by. The<br/>man looked at her in terror and began to whimper.<br/><br/>At the end of the room there was a little staircase, leading to<br/>a darkened chamber. As Dorian hurried up its three rickety steps,<br/>the heavy odour of opium met him. He heaved a deep breath, and his<br/>nostrils quivered with pleasure. When he entered, a young man with<br/>smooth yellow hair, who was bending over a lamp lighting a long<br/>thin pipe, looked up at him and nodded in a hesitating manner.<br/><br/>"You here, Adrian?" muttered Dorian.<br/><br/>"Where else should I be?" he answered, listlessly. "None of the<br/>chaps will speak to me now."<br/>
