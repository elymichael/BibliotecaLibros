"Hush, Alan. You have saved my life," said Dorian.<br/><br/>"Your life? Good heavens! what a life that is! You have gone<br/>from corruption to corruption, and now you have culminated in<br/>crime. In doing what I am going to do—what you force me to do— it<br/>is not of your life that I am thinking."<br/><br/>"Ah, Alan," murmured Dorian with a sigh, "I wish you had a<br/>thousandth part of the pity for me that I have for you." He turned<br/>away as he spoke and stood looking out at the garden. Campbell made<br/>no answer.<br/><br/>After about ten minutes a knock came to the door, and the<br/>servant entered, carrying a large mahogany chest of chemicals, with<br/>a long coil of steel and platinum wire and two rather curiously<br/>shaped iron clamps.<br/><br/>"Shall I leave the things here, sir?" he asked Campbell.<br/><br/>"Yes," said Dorian. "And I am afraid, Francis, that I have<br/>another errand for you. What is the name of the man at Richmond who<br/>supplies Selby with orchids?"<br/><br/>"Harden, sir."<br/><br/>"Yes—Harden. You must go down to Richmond at once, see Harden<br/>personally, and tell him to send twice as many orchids as I<br/>ordered, and to have as few white ones as possible. In fact, I<br/>don't want any white ones. It is a lovely day, Francis, and<br/>Richmond is a very pretty place— otherwise I wouldn't bother you<br/>about it."<br/><br/>"No trouble, sir. At what time shall I be back?"<br/><br/>Dorian looked at Campbell. "How long will your experiment take,<br/>Alan?" he said in a calm indifferent voice. The presence of a third<br/>person in the room seemed to give him extraordinary courage.<br/><br/>Campbell frowned and bit his lip. "It will take about five<br/>hours," he answered.<br/>
