Yet it was not this alone that made him gloomy and morose.<br/>Inexperienced though he was, he had still a strong sense of the<br/>danger of Sibyl's position. This young dandy who was making love to<br/>her could mean her no good. He was a gentleman, and he hated him<br/>for that, hated him through some curious race-instinct for which he<br/>could not account, and which for that reason was all the more<br/>dominant within him. He was conscious also of the shallowness and<br/>vanity of his mother's nature, and in that saw infinite peril for<br/>Sibyl and Sibyl's happiness. Children begin by loving their<br/>parents; as they grow older they judge them; sometimes they forgive<br/>them.<br/><br/>His mother! He had something on his mind to ask of her,<br/>something that he had brooded on for many months of silence. A<br/>chance phrase that he had heard at the theatre, a whispered sneer<br/>that had reached his ears one night as he waited at the stage-door,<br/>had set loose a train of horrible thoughts. He remembered it as if<br/>it had been the lash of a hunting-crop across his face. His brows<br/>knit together into a wedgelike furrow, and with a twitch of pain he<br/>bit his underlip.<br/><br/>"You are not listening to a word I am saying, Jim," cried Sibyl,<br/>"and I am making the most delightful plans for your future. Do say<br/>something."<br/><br/>"What do you want me to say?"<br/><br/>"Oh! that you will be a good boy and not forget us," she<br/>answered, smiling at him.<br/><br/>He shrugged his shoulders. "You are more likely to forget me<br/>than I am to forget you, Sibyl."<br/><br/>She flushed. "What do you mean, Jim?" she asked.<br/><br/>"You have a new friend, I hear. Who is he? Why have you not told<br/>me about him? He means you no good."<br/><br/>"Stop, Jim!" she exclaimed. "You must not say anything against<br/>him. I love him."<br/><br/>"Why, you don't even know his name," answered the lad. "Who is<br/>he? I have a right to know."<br/><br/>"He is called Prince Charming. Don't you like the name. Oh! you<br/>silly boy! you should never forget it. If you only saw him, you<br/>would think him the most wonderful person in the world. Some day<br/>you will meet him—when you come back from Australia. You will like<br/>him so much. Everybody likes him, and I&#160;… love him. I wish you<br/>could come to the theatre to-night. He is going to be there, and I<br/>am to play Juliet. Oh! how I shall play it! Fancy, Jim, to be in<br/>love and play Juliet! To have him sitting there! To play for his<br/>delight! I am afraid I may frighten the company, frighten or<br/>enthrall them. To be in love is to surpass one's self. Poor<br/>dreadful Mr. Isaacs will be shouting 'genius' to his loafers at the<br/>bar. He has preached me as a dogma; to-night he will announce me as<br/>a revelation. I feel it. And it is all his, his only, Prince<br/>Charming, my wonderful lover, my god of graces. But I am poor<br/>beside him. Poor? What does that matter? When poverty creeps in at<br/>the door, love flies in through the window. Our proverbs want<br/>rewriting. They were made in winter, and it is summer now;<br/>spring-time for me, I think, a very dance of blossoms in blue<br/>skies."<br/>
