And, certainly, to him life itself was the first, the greatest,<br/>of the arts, and for it all the other arts seemed to be but a<br/>preparation. Fashion, by which what is really fantastic becomes for<br/>a moment universal, and dandyism, which, in its own way, is an<br/>attempt to assert the absolute modernity of beauty, had, of course,<br/>their fascination for him. His mode of dressing, and the particular<br/>styles that from time to time he affected, had their marked<br/>influence on the young exquisites of the Mayfair balls and Pall<br/>Mall club windows, who copied him in everything that he did, and<br/>tried to reproduce the accidental charm of his graceful, though to<br/>him only half-serious fopperies.<br/><br/>For, while he was but too ready to accept the position that was<br/>almost immediately offered to him on his coming of age, and found,<br/>indeed, a subtle pleasure in the thought that he might really<br/>become to the London of his own day what to imperial Neronian Rome<br/>the author of the Satyricon once had been, yet in his inmost heart<br/>he desired to be something more than a mere arbiter elegantiarum,<br/>to be consulted on the wearing of a jewel, or the knotting of a<br/>necktie, or the conduct of a cane. He sought to elaborate some new<br/>scheme of life that would have its reasoned philosophy and its<br/>ordered principles, and find in the spiritualizing of the senses<br/>its highest realization.<br/><br/>The worship of the senses has often, and with much justice, been<br/>decried, men feeling a natural instinct of terror about passions<br/>and sensations that seem stronger than themselves, and that they<br/>are conscious of sharing with the less highly organized forms of<br/>existence. But it appeared to Dorian Gray that the true nature of<br/>the senses had never been understood, and that they had remained<br/>savage and animal merely because the world had sought to starve<br/>them into submission or to kill them by pain, instead of aiming at<br/>making them elements of a new spirituality, of which a fine<br/>instinct for beauty was to be the dominant characteristic. As he<br/>looked back upon man moving through history, he was haunted by a<br/>feeling of loss. So much had been surrendered! and to such little<br/>purpose! There had been mad wilful rejections, monstrous forms of<br/>self-torture and self-denial, whose origin was fear and whose<br/>result was a degradation infinitely more terrible than that fancied<br/>degradation from which, in their ignorance, they had sought to<br/>escape; Nature, in her wonderful irony, driving out the anchorite<br/>to feed with the wild animals of the desert and giving to the<br/>hermit the beasts of the field as his companions.<br/><br/>Yes: there was to be, as Lord Henry had prophesied, a new<br/>Hedonism that was to recreate life and to save it from that harsh<br/>uncomely puritanism that is having, in our own day, its curious<br/>revival. It was to have its service of the intellect, certainly,<br/>yet it was never to accept any theory or system that would involve<br/>the sacrifice of any mode of passionate experience. Its aim,<br/>indeed, was to be experience itself, and not the fruits of<br/>experience, sweet or bitter as they might be. Of the asceticism<br/>that deadens the senses, as of the vulgar profligacy that dulls<br/>them, it was to know nothing. But it was to teach man to<br/>concentrate himself upon the moments of a life that is itself but a<br/>moment.<br/><br/>There are few of us who have not sometimes wakened before dawn,<br/>either after one of those dreamless nights that make us almost<br/>enamoured of death, or one of those nights of horror and misshapen<br/>joy, when through the chambers of the brain sweep phantoms more<br/>terrible than reality itself, and instinct with that vivid life<br/>that lurks in all grotesques, and that lends to Gothic art its<br/>enduring vitality, this art being, one might fancy, especially the<br/>art of those whose minds have been troubled with the malady of<br/>reverie. Gradually white fingers creep through the curtains, and<br/>they appear to tremble. In black fantastic shapes, dumb shadows<br/>crawl into the corners of the room and crouch there. Outside, there<br/>is the stirring of birds among the leaves, or the sound of men<br/>going forth to their work, or the sigh and sob of the wind coming<br/>down from the hills and wandering round the silent house, as though<br/>it feared to wake the sleepers and yet must needs call forth sleep<br/>from her purple cave. Veil after veil of thin dusky gauze is<br/>lifted, and by degrees the forms and colours of things are restored<br/>to them, and we watch the dawn remaking the world in its antique<br/>pattern. The wan mirrors get back their mimic life. The flameless<br/>tapers stand where we had left them, and beside them lies the<br/>half-cut book that we had been studying, or the wired flower that<br/>we had worn at the ball, or the letter that we had been afraid to<br/>read, or that we had read too often. Nothing seems to us changed.<br/>Out of the unreal shadows of the night comes back the real life<br/>that we had known. We have to resume it where we had left off, and<br/>there steals over us a terrible sense of the necessity for the<br/>continuance of energy in the same wearisome round of stereotyped<br/>habits, or a wild longing, it may be, that our eyelids might open<br/>some morning upon a world that had been refashioned anew in the<br/>darkness for our pleasure, a world in which things would have fresh<br/>shapes and colours, and be changed, or have other secrets, a world<br/>in which the past would have little or no place, or survive, at any<br/>rate, in no conscious form of obligation or regret, the remembrance<br/>even of joy having its bitterness and the memories of pleasure<br/>their pain.<br/><br/>It was the creation of such worlds as these that seemed to<br/>Dorian Gray to be the true object, or amongst the true objects, of<br/>life; and in his search for sensations that would be at once new<br/>and delightful, and possess that element of strangeness that is so<br/>essential to romance, he would often adopt certain modes of thought<br/>that he knew to be really alien to his nature, abandon himself to<br/>their subtle influences, and then, having, as it were, caught their<br/>colour and satisfied his intellectual curiosity, leave them with<br/>that curious indifference that is not incompatible with a real<br/>ardour of temperament, and that, indeed, according to certain<br/>modern psychologists, is often a condition of it.<br/><br/>It was rumoured of him once that he was about to join the Roman<br/>Catholic communion, and certainly the Roman ritual had always a<br/>great attraction for him. The daily sacrifice, more awful really<br/>than all the sacrifices of the antique world, stirred him as much<br/>by its superb rejection of the evidence of the senses as by the<br/>primitive simplicity of its elements and the eternal pathos of the<br/>human tragedy that it sought to symbolize. He loved to kneel down<br/>on the cold marble pavement and watch the priest, in his stiff<br/>flowered dalmatic, slowly and with white hands moving aside the<br/>veil of the tabernacle, or raising aloft the jewelled,<br/>lantern-shaped monstrance with that pallid wafer that at times, one<br/>would fain think, is indeed the "panis caelestis," the bread of<br/>angels, or, robed in the garments of the Passion of Christ,<br/>breaking the Host into the chalice and smiting his breast for his<br/>sins. The fuming censers that the grave boys, in their lace and<br/>scarlet, tossed into the air like great gilt flowers had their<br/>subtle fascination for him. As he passed out, he used to look with<br/>wonder at the black confessionals and long to sit in the dim shadow<br/>of one of them and listen to men and women whispering through the<br/>worn grating the true story of their lives.<br/><br/>But he never fell into the error of arresting his intellectual<br/>development by any formal acceptance of creed or system, or of<br/>mistaking, for a house in which to live, an inn that is but<br/>suitable for the sojourn of a night, or for a few hours of a night<br/>in which there are no stars and the moon is in travail. Mysticism,<br/>with its marvellous power of making common things strange to us,<br/>and the subtle antinomianism that always seems to accompany it,<br/>moved him for a season; and for a season he inclined to the<br/>materialistic doctrines of the Darwinismus movement in Germany, and<br/>found a curious pleasure in tracing the thoughts and passions of<br/>men to some pearly cell in the brain, or some white nerve in the<br/>body, delighting in the conception of the absolute dependence of<br/>the spirit on certain physical conditions, morbid or healthy,<br/>normal or diseased. Yet, as has been said of him before, no theory<br/>of life seemed to him to be of any importance compared with life<br/>itself. He felt keenly conscious of how barren all intellectual<br/>speculation is when separated from action and experiment. He knew<br/>that the senses, no less than the soul, have their spiritual<br/>mysteries to reveal.<br/><br/>And so he would now study perfumes and the secrets of their<br/>manufacture, distilling heavily scented oils and burning odorous<br/>gums from the East. He saw that there was no mood of the mind that<br/>had not its counterpart in the sensuous life, and set himself to<br/>discover their true relations, wondering what there was in<br/>frankincense that made one mystical, and in ambergris that stirred<br/>one's passions, and in violets that woke the memory of dead<br/>romances, and in musk that troubled the brain, and in champak that<br/>stained the imagination; and seeking often to elaborate a real<br/>psychology of perfumes, and to estimate the several influences of<br/>sweet-smelling roots and scented, pollen-laden flowers; of aromatic<br/>balms and of dark and fragrant woods; of spikenard, that sickens;<br/>of hovenia, that makes men mad; and of aloes, that are said to be<br/>able to expel melancholy from the soul.<br/><br/>At another time he devoted himself entirely to music, and in a<br/>long latticed room, with a vermilion-and-gold ceiling and walls of<br/>olive-green lacquer, he used to give curious concerts in which mad<br/>gipsies tore wild music from little zithers, or grave,<br/>yellow-shawled Tunisians plucked at the strained strings of<br/>monstrous lutes, while grinning Negroes beat monotonously upon<br/>copper drums and, crouching upon scarlet mats, slim turbaned<br/>Indians blew through long pipes of reed or brass and charmed— or<br/>feigned to charm—great hooded snakes and horrible horned adders.<br/>The harsh intervals and shrill discords of barbaric music stirred<br/>him at times when Schubert's grace, and Chopin's beautiful sorrows,<br/>and the mighty harmonies of Beethoven himself, fell unheeded on his<br/>ear. He collected together from all parts of the world the<br/>strangest instruments that could be found, either in the tombs of<br/>dead nations or among the few savage tribes that have survived<br/>contact with Western civilizations, and loved to touch and try<br/>them. He had the mysterious juruparis of the Rio Negro Indians,<br/>that women are not allowed to look at and that even youths may not<br/>see till they have been subjected to fasting and scourging, and the<br/>earthen jars of the Peruvians that have the shrill cries of birds,<br/>and flutes of human bones such as Alfonso de Ovalle heard in Chile,<br/>and the sonorous green jaspers that are found near Cuzco and give<br/>forth a note of singular sweetness. He had painted gourds filled<br/>with pebbles that rattled when they were shaken; the long clarin of<br/>the Mexicans, into which the performer does not blow, but through<br/>which he inhales the air; the harsh ture of the Amazon tribes, that<br/>is sounded by the sentinels who sit all day long in high trees, and<br/>can be heard, it is said, at a distance of three leagues; the<br/>teponaztli, that has two vibrating tongues of wood and is beaten<br/>with sticks that are smeared with an elastic gum obtained from the<br/>milky juice of plants; the yotl-bells of the Aztecs, that are hung<br/>in clusters like grapes; and a huge cylindrical drum, covered with<br/>the skins of great serpents, like the one that Bernal Diaz saw when<br/>he went with Cortes into the Mexican temple, and of whose doleful<br/>sound he has left us so vivid a description. The fantastic<br/>character of these instruments fascinated him, and he felt a<br/>curious delight in the thought that art, like Nature, has her<br/>monsters, things of bestial shape and with hideous voices. Yet,<br/>after some time, he wearied of them, and would sit in his box at<br/>the opera, either alone or with Lord Henry, listening in rapt<br/>pleasure to "Tannhauser" and seeing in the prelude to that great<br/>work of art a presentation of the tragedy of his own soul.<br/><br/>On one occasion he took up the study of jewels, and appeared at<br/>a costume ball as Anne de Joyeuse, Admiral of France, in a dress<br/>covered with five hundred and sixty pearls. This taste enthralled<br/>him for years, and, indeed, may be said never to have left him. He<br/>would often spend a whole day settling and resettling in their<br/>cases the various stones that be had collected, such as the<br/>olive-green chrysoberyl that turns red by lamplight, the cymophane<br/>with its wirelike line of silver, the pistachio-coloured peridot,<br/>rose-pink and wine-yellow topazes, carbuncles of fiery scarlet with<br/>tremulous, four-rayed stars, flame-red cinnamon-stones, orange and<br/>violet spinels, and amethysts with their alternate layers of ruby<br/>and sapphire. He loved the red gold of the sunstone, and the<br/>moonstone's pearly whiteness, and the broken rainbow of the milky<br/>opal. He procured from Amsterdam three emeralds of extraordinary<br/>size and richness of colour, and had a turquoise de la vieille<br/>roche that was the envy of all the connoisseurs.<br/>
