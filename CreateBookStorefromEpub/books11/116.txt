He turned and hurried out, just conscious that the dead man had
been thrust back into the chair and that Campbell was gazing into a
glistening yellow face. As he was going downstairs, he heard the
key being turned in the lock.

It was long after seven when Campbell came back into the
library. He was pale, but absolutely calm. "I have done what you
asked me to do," he muttered "And now, good-bye. Let us never see
each other again."

"You have saved me from ruin, Alan. I cannot forget that," said
Dorian simply.

As soon as Campbell had left, he went upstairs. There was a
horrible smell of nitric acid in the room. But the thing that had
been sitting at the table was gone.
