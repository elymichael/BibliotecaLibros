<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>17<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>A week later Dorian Gray was sitting in the conservatory at<br/>Selby Royal, talking to the pretty Duchess of Monmouth, who with<br/>her husband, a jaded-looking man of sixty, was amongst his guests.<br/>It was tea-time, and the mellow light of the huge, lace-covered<br/>lamp that stood on the table lit up the delicate china and hammered<br/>silver of the service at which the duchess was presiding. Her white<br/>hands were moving daintily among the cups, and her full red lips<br/>were smiling at something that Dorian had whispered to her. Lord<br/>Henry was lying back in a silk-draped wicker chair, looking at<br/>them. On a peach-coloured divan sat Lady Narborough, pretending to<br/>listen to the duke's description of the last Brazilian beetle that<br/>he had added to his collection. Three young men in elaborate<br/>smoking-suits were handing tea-cakes to some of the women. The<br/>house-party consisted of twelve people, and there were more<br/>expected to arrive on the next day.<br/><br/>"What are you two talking about?" said Lord Henry, strolling<br/>over to the table and putting his cup down. "I hope Dorian has told<br/>you about my plan for rechristening everything, Gladys. It is a<br/>delightful idea."<br/><br/>"But I don't want to be rechristened, Harry," rejoined the<br/>duchess, looking up at him with her wonderful eyes. "I am quite<br/>satisfied with my own name, and I am sure Mr. Gray should be<br/>satisfied with his."<br/><br/>"My dear Gladys, I would not alter either name for the world.<br/>They are both perfect. I was thinking chiefly of flowers. Yesterday<br/>I cut an orchid, for my button-hole. It was a marvellous spotted<br/>thing, as effective as the seven deadly sins. In a thoughtless<br/>moment I asked one of the gardeners what it was called. He told me<br/>it was a fine specimen of Robinsoniana, or something dreadful of<br/>that kind. It is a sad truth, but we have lost the faculty of<br/>giving lovely names to things. Names are everything. I never<br/>quarrel with actions. My one quarrel is with words. That is the<br/>reason I hate vulgar realism in literature. The man who could call<br/>a spade a spade should be compelled to use one. It is the only<br/>thing he is fit for."<br/><br/>"Then what should we call you, Harry?" she asked.<br/><br/>"His name is Prince Paradox," said Dorian.<br/><br/>
