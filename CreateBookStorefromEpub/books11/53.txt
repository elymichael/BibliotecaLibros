Yet it was not this alone that made him gloomy and morose.
Inexperienced though he was, he had still a strong sense of the
danger of Sibyl's position. This young dandy who was making love to
her could mean her no good. He was a gentleman, and he hated him
for that, hated him through some curious race-instinct for which he
could not account, and which for that reason was all the more
dominant within him. He was conscious also of the shallowness and
vanity of his mother's nature, and in that saw infinite peril for
Sibyl and Sibyl's happiness. Children begin by loving their
parents; as they grow older they judge them; sometimes they forgive
them.

His mother! He had something on his mind to ask of her,
something that he had brooded on for many months of silence. A
chance phrase that he had heard at the theatre, a whispered sneer
that had reached his ears one night as he waited at the stage-door,
had set loose a train of horrible thoughts. He remembered it as if
it had been the lash of a hunting-crop across his face. His brows
knit together into a wedgelike furrow, and with a twitch of pain he
bit his underlip.

"You are not listening to a word I am saying, Jim," cried Sibyl,
"and I am making the most delightful plans for your future. Do say
something."

"What do you want me to say?"

"Oh! that you will be a good boy and not forget us," she
answered, smiling at him.

He shrugged his shoulders. "You are more likely to forget me
than I am to forget you, Sibyl."

She flushed. "What do you mean, Jim?" she asked.

"You have a new friend, I hear. Who is he? Why have you not told
me about him? He means you no good."

"Stop, Jim!" she exclaimed. "You must not say anything against
him. I love him."

"Why, you don't even know his name," answered the lad. "Who is
he? I have a right to know."

"He is called Prince Charming. Don't you like the name. Oh! you
silly boy! you should never forget it. If you only saw him, you
would think him the most wonderful person in the world. Some day
you will meet him—when you come back from Australia. You will like
him so much. Everybody likes him, and I&#160;… love him. I wish you
could come to the theatre to-night. He is going to be there, and I
am to play Juliet. Oh! how I shall play it! Fancy, Jim, to be in
love and play Juliet! To have him sitting there! To play for his
delight! I am afraid I may frighten the company, frighten or
enthrall them. To be in love is to surpass one's self. Poor
dreadful Mr. Isaacs will be shouting 'genius' to his loafers at the
bar. He has preached me as a dogma; to-night he will announce me as
a revelation. I feel it. And it is all his, his only, Prince
Charming, my wonderful lover, my god of graces. But I am poor
beside him. Poor? What does that matter? When poverty creeps in at
the door, love flies in through the window. Our proverbs want
rewriting. They were made in winter, and it is summer now;
spring-time for me, I think, a very dance of blossoms in blue
skies."
