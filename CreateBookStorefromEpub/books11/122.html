"Never mind, Lady Narborough. I smoke a great deal too much. I<br/>am going to limit myself, for the future."<br/><br/>"Pray don't, Lady Ruxton," said Lord Henry. "Moderation is a<br/>fatal thing. Enough is as bad as a meal. More than enough is as<br/>good as a feast."<br/><br/>Lady Ruxton glanced at him curiously. "You must come and explain<br/>that to me some afternoon, Lord Henry. It sounds a fascinating<br/>theory," she murmured, as she swept out of the room.<br/><br/>"Now, mind you don't stay too long over your politics and<br/>scandal," cried Lady Narborough from the door. "If you do, we are<br/>sure to squabble upstairs."<br/><br/>The men laughed, and Mr. Chapman got up solemnly from the foot<br/>of the table and came up to the top. Dorian Gray changed his seat<br/>and went and sat by Lord Henry. Mr. Chapman began to talk in a loud<br/>voice about the situation in the House of Commons. He guffawed at<br/>his adversaries. The word doctrinaire—word full of terror to the<br/>British mind— reappeared from time to time between his explosions.<br/>An alliterative prefix served as an ornament of oratory. He hoisted<br/>the Union Jack on the pinnacles of thought. The inherited stupidity<br/>of the race—sound English common sense he jovially termed it—was<br/>shown to be the proper bulwark for society.<br/><br/>A smile curved Lord Henry's lips, and he turned round and looked<br/>at Dorian.<br/><br/>"Are you better, my dear fellow?" he asked. "You seemed rather<br/>out of sorts at dinner."<br/><br/>"I am quite well, Harry. I am tired. That is all."<br/><br/>"You were charming last night. The little duchess is quite<br/>devoted to you. She tells me she is going down to Selby."<br/><br/>"She has promised to come on the twentieth."<br/><br/>"Is Monmouth to be there, too?"<br/>
