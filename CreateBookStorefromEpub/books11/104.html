"Good God, Dorian, what a lesson! What an awful lesson!" There<br/>was no answer, but he could hear the young man sobbing at the<br/>window. "Pray, Dorian, pray," he murmured. "What is it that one was<br/>taught to say in one's boyhood? 'Lead us not into temptation.<br/>Forgive us our sins. Wash away our iniquities.' Let us say that<br/>together. The prayer of your pride has been answered. The prayer of<br/>your repentance will be answered also. I worshipped you too much. I<br/>am punished for it. You worshipped yourself too much. We are both<br/>punished."<br/><br/>Dorian Gray turned slowly around and looked at him with<br/>tear-dimmed eyes. "It is too late, Basil," he faltered.<br/><br/>"It is never too late, Dorian. Let us kneel down and try if we<br/>cannot remember a prayer. Isn't there a verse somewhere, 'Though<br/>your sins be as scarlet, yet I will make them as white as<br/>snow'?"<br/><br/>"Those words mean nothing to me now."<br/><br/>"Hush! Don't say that. You have done enough evil in your life.<br/>My God! Don't you see that accursed thing leering at us?"<br/><br/>Dorian Gray glanced at the picture, and suddenly an<br/>uncontrollable feeling of hatred for Basil Hallward came over him,<br/>as though it had been suggested to him by the image on the canvas,<br/>whispered into his ear by those grinning lips. The mad passions of<br/>a hunted animal stirred within him, and he loathed the man who was<br/>seated at the table, more than in his whole life he had ever<br/>loathed anything. He glanced wildly around. Something glimmered on<br/>the top of the painted chest that faced him. His eye fell on it. He<br/>knew what it was. It was a knife that he had brought up, some days<br/>before, to cut a piece of cord, and had forgotten to take away with<br/>him. He moved slowly towards it, passing Hallward as he did so. As<br/>soon as he got behind him, he seized it and turned round. Hallward<br/>stirred in his chair as if he was going to rise. He rushed at him<br/>and dug the knife into the great vein that is behind the ear,<br/>crushing the man's head down on the table and stabbing again and<br/>again.<br/><br/>There was a stifled groan and the horrible sound of some one<br/>choking with blood. Three times the outstretched arms shot up<br/>convulsively, waving grotesque, stiff-fingered hands in the air. He<br/>stabbed him twice more, but the man did not move. Something began<br/>to trickle on the floor. He waited for a moment, still pressing the<br/>head down. Then he threw the knife on the table, and listened.<br/><br/>He could hear nothing, but the drip, drip on the threadbare<br/>carpet. He opened the door and went out on the landing. The house<br/>was absolutely quiet. No one was about. For a few seconds he stood<br/>bending over the balustrade and peering down into the black<br/>seething well of darkness. Then he took out the key and returned to<br/>the room, locking himself in as he did so.<br/><br/>The thing was still seated in the chair, straining over the<br/>table with bowed head, and humped back, and long fantastic arms.<br/>Had it not been for the red jagged tear in the neck and the clotted<br/>black pool that was slowly widening on the table, one would have<br/>said that the man was simply asleep.<br/><br/>How quickly it had all been done! He felt strangely calm, and<br/>walking over to the window, opened it and stepped out on the<br/>balcony. The wind had blown the fog away, and the sky was like a<br/>monstrous peacock's tail, starred with myriads of golden eyes. He<br/>looked down and saw the policeman going his rounds and flashing the<br/>long beam of his lantern on the doors of the silent houses. The<br/>crimson spot of a prowling hansom gleamed at the corner and then<br/>vanished. A woman in a fluttering shawl was creeping slowly by the<br/>railings, staggering as she went. Now and then she stopped and<br/>peered back. Once, she began to sing in a hoarse voice. The<br/>policeman strolled over and said something to her. She stumbled<br/>away, laughing. A bitter blast swept across the square. The<br/>gas-lamps flickered and became blue, and the leafless trees shook<br/>their black iron branches to and fro. He shivered and went back,<br/>closing the window behind him.<br/><br/>Having reached the door, he turned the key and opened it. He did<br/>not even glance at the murdered man. He felt that the secret of the<br/>whole thing was not to realize the situation. The friend who had<br/>painted the fatal portrait to which all his misery had been due had<br/>gone out of his life. That was enough.<br/>
