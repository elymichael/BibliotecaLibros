"Did you go to the club?"<br/><br/>"Yes," he answered. Then he bit his lip. "No, I don't mean that.<br/>I didn't go to the club. I walked about. I forget what I didâ€¦ . How<br/>inquisitive you are, Harry! You always want to know what one has<br/>been doing. I always want to forget what I have been doing. I came<br/>in at half-past two, if you wish to know the exact time. I had left<br/>my latch-key at home, and my servant had to let me in. If you want<br/>any corroborative evidence on the subject, you can ask him."<br/><br/>Lord Henry shrugged his shoulders. "My dear fellow, as if I<br/>cared! Let us go up to the drawing-room. No sherry, thank you, Mr.<br/>Chapman. Something has happened to you, Dorian. Tell me what it is.<br/>You are not yourself to-night."<br/><br/>"Don't mind me, Harry. I am irritable, and out of temper. I<br/>shall come round and see you to-morrow, or next day. Make my<br/>excuses to Lady Narborough. I shan't go upstairs. I shall go home.<br/>I must go home."<br/><br/>"All right, Dorian. I dare say I shall see you to-morrow at<br/>tea-time. The duchess is coming."<br/><br/>"I will try to be there, Harry," he said, leaving the room. As<br/>he drove back to his own house, he was conscious that the sense of<br/>terror he thought he had strangled had come back to him. Lord<br/>Henry's casual questioning had made him lose his nerves for the<br/>moment, and he wanted his nerve still. Things that were dangerous<br/>had to be destroyed. He winced. He hated the idea of even touching<br/>them.<br/><br/>Yet it had to be done. He realized that, and when he had locked<br/>the door of his library, he opened the secret press into which he<br/>had thrust Basil Hallward's coat and bag. A huge fire was blazing.<br/>He piled another log on it. The smell of the singeing clothes and<br/>burning leather was horrible. It took him three-quarters of an hour<br/>to consume everything. At the end he felt faint and sick, and<br/>having lit some Algerian pastilles in a pierced copper brazier, he<br/>bathed his hands and forehead with a cool musk-scented vinegar.<br/><br/>Suddenly he started. His eyes grew strangely bright, and he<br/>gnawed nervously at his underlip. Between two of the windows stood<br/>a large Florentine cabinet, made out of ebony and inlaid with ivory<br/>and blue lapis. He watched it as though it were a thing that could<br/>fascinate and make afraid, as though it held something that he<br/>longed for and yet almost loathed. His breath quickened. A mad<br/>craving came over him. He lit a cigarette and then threw it away.<br/>His eyelids drooped till the long fringed lashes almost touched his<br/>cheek. But he still watched the cabinet. At last he got up from the<br/>sofa on which he had been lying, went over to it, and having<br/>unlocked it, touched some hidden spring. A triangular drawer passed<br/>slowly out. His fingers moved instinctively towards it, dipped in,<br/>and closed on something. It was a small Chinese box of black and<br/>gold-dust lacquer, elaborately wrought, the sides patterned with<br/>curved waves, and the silken cords hung with round crystals and<br/>tasselled in plaited metal threads. He opened it. Inside was a<br/>green paste, waxy in lustre, the odour curiously heavy and<br/>persistent.<br/><br/>He hesitated for some moments, with a strangely immobile smile<br/>upon his face. Then shivering, though the atmosphere of the room<br/>was terribly hot, he drew himself up and glanced at the clock. It<br/>was twenty minutes to twelve. He put the box back, shutting the<br/>cabinet doors as he did so, and went into his bedroom.<br/><br/>As midnight was striking bronze blows upon the dusky air, Dorian<br/>Gray, dressed commonly, and with a muffler wrapped round his<br/>throat, crept quietly out of his house. In Bond Street he found a<br/>hansom with a good horse. He hailed it and in a low voice gave the<br/>driver an address.<br/><br/>The man shook his head. "It is too far for me," he muttered.<br/>
