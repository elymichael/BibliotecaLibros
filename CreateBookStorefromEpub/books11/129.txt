"I don't want anything," murmured the young man.

"Never mind."

Adrian Singleton rose up wearily and followed Dorian to the bar.
A half-caste, in a ragged turban and a shabby ulster, grinned a
hideous greeting as he thrust a bottle of brandy and two tumblers
in front of them. The women sidled up and began to chatter. Dorian
turned his back on them and said something in a low voice to Adrian
Singleton.

A crooked smile, like a Malay crease, writhed across the face of
one of the women. "We are very proud to-night," she sneered.

"For God's sake don't talk to me," cried Dorian, stamping his
foot on the ground. "What do you want? Money? Here it is. Don't
ever talk to me again."

Two red sparks flashed for a moment in the woman's sodden eyes,
then flickered out and left them dull and glazed. She tossed her
head and raked the coins off the counter with greedy fingers. Her
companion watched her enviously.

"It's no use," sighed Adrian Singleton. "I don't care to go
back. What does it matter? I am quite happy here."

"You will write to me if you want anything, won't you?" said
Dorian, after a pause.

"Perhaps."

"Good night, then."

"Good night," answered the young man, passing up the steps and
wiping his parched mouth with a handkerchief.
