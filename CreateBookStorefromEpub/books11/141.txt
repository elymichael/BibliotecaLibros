The duchess turned and looked at Dorian Gray with a curious
expression in her eyes. "What do you say to that, Mr. Gray?" she
inquired.

Dorian hesitated for a moment. Then he threw his head back and
laughed. "I always agree with Harry, Duchess."

"Even when he is wrong?"

"Harry is never wrong, Duchess."

"And does his philosophy make you happy?"

"I have never searched for happiness. Who wants happiness? I
have searched for pleasure."

"And found it, Mr. Gray?"

"Often. Too often."

The duchess sighed. "I am searching for peace," she said, "and
if I don't go and dress, I shall have none this evening."

"Let me get you some orchids, Duchess," cried Dorian, starting
to his feet and walking down the conservatory.

"You are flirting disgracefully with him," said Lord Henry to
his cousin. "You had better take care. He is very fascinating."
