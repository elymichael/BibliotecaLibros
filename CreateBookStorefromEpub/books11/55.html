She started to her feet. "There he is!" she cried.<br/><br/>"Who?" said Jim Vane.<br/><br/>"Prince Charming," she answered, looking after the victoria.<br/><br/>He jumped up and seized her roughly by the arm. "Show him to me.<br/>Which is he? Point him out. I must see him!" he exclaimed; but at<br/>that moment the Duke of Berwick's four-in-hand came between, and<br/>when it had left the space clear, the carriage had swept out of the<br/>park.<br/><br/>"He is gone," murmured Sibyl sadly. "I wish you had seen<br/>him."<br/><br/>"I wish I had, for as sure as there is a God in heaven, if he<br/>ever does you any wrong, I shall kill him."<br/><br/>She looked at him in horror. He repeated his words. They cut the<br/>air like a dagger. The people round began to gape. A lady standing<br/>close to her tittered.<br/><br/>"Come away, Jim; come away," she whispered. He followed her<br/>doggedly as she passed through the crowd. He felt glad at what he<br/>had said.<br/><br/>When they reached the Achilles Statue, she turned round. There<br/>was pity in her eyes that became laughter on her lips. She shook<br/>her head at him. "You are foolish, Jim, utterly foolish; a<br/>bad-tempered boy, that is all. How can you say such horrible<br/>things? You don't know what you are talking about. You are simply<br/>jealous and unkind. Ah! I wish you would fall in love. Love makes<br/>people good, and what you said was wicked."<br/><br/>"I am sixteen," he answered, "and I know what I am about. Mother<br/>is no help to you. She doesn't understand how to look after you. I<br/>wish now that I was not going to Australia at all. I have a great<br/>mind to chuck the whole thing up. I would, if my articles hadn't<br/>been signed."<br/><br/>"Oh, don't be so serious, Jim. You are like one of the heroes of<br/>those silly melodramas Mother used to be so fond of acting in. I am<br/>not going to quarrel with you. I have seen him, and oh! to see him<br/>is perfect happiness. We won't quarrel. I know you would never harm<br/>any one I love, would you?"<br/>
