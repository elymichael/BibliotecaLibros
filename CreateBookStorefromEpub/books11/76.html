"You have done too many foolish things during the last fortnight<br/>to be entitled to give yourself that name, Dorian," answered Lord<br/>Henry with his sweet melancholy smile.<br/><br/>The lad frowned. "I don't like that explanation, Harry," he<br/>rejoined, "but I am glad you don't think I am heartless. I am<br/>nothing of the kind. I know I am not. And yet I must admit that<br/>this thing that has happened does not affect me as it should. It<br/>seems to me to be simply like a wonderful ending to a wonderful<br/>play. It has all the terrible beauty of a Greek tragedy, a tragedy<br/>in which I took a great part, but by which I have not been<br/>wounded."<br/><br/>"It is an interesting question," said Lord Henry, who found an<br/>exquisite pleasure in playing on the lad's unconscious egotism, "an<br/>extremely interesting question. I fancy that the true explanation<br/>is this: It often happens that the real tragedies of life occur in<br/>such an inartistic manner that they hurt us by their crude<br/>violence, their absolute incoherence, their absurd want of meaning,<br/>their entire lack of style. They affect us just as vulgarity<br/>affects us. They give us an impression of sheer brute force, and we<br/>revolt against that. Sometimes, however, a tragedy that possesses<br/>artistic elements of beauty crosses our lives. If these elements of<br/>beauty are real, the whole thing simply appeals to our sense of<br/>dramatic effect. Suddenly we find that we are no longer the actors,<br/>but the spectators of the play. Or rather we are both. We watch<br/>ourselves, and the mere wonder of the spectacle enthralls us. In<br/>the present case, what is it that has really happened? Some one has<br/>killed herself for love of you. I wish that I had ever had such an<br/>experience. It would have made me in love with love for the rest of<br/>my life. The people who have adored me—there have not been very<br/>many, but there have been some—have always insisted on living on,<br/>long after I had ceased to care for them, or they to care for me.<br/>They have become stout and tedious, and when I meet them, they go<br/>in at once for reminiscences. That awful memory of woman! What a<br/>fearful thing it is! And what an utter intellectual stagnation it<br/>reveals! One should absorb the colour of life, but one should never<br/>remember its details. Details are always vulgar."<br/><br/>"I must sow poppies in my garden," sighed Dorian.<br/><br/>"There is no necessity," rejoined his companion. "Life has<br/>always poppies in her hands. Of course, now and then things linger.<br/>I once wore nothing but violets all through one season, as a form<br/>of artistic mourning for a romance that would not die. Ultimately,<br/>however, it did die. I forget what killed it. I think it was her<br/>proposing to sacrifice the whole world for me. That is always a<br/>dreadful moment. It fills one with the terror of eternity.<br/>Well—would you believe it?—a week ago, at Lady Hampshire's, I found<br/>myself seated at dinner next the lady in question, and she insisted<br/>on going over the whole thing again, and digging up the past, and<br/>raking up the future. I had buried my romance in a bed of asphodel.<br/>She dragged it out again and assured me that I had spoiled her<br/>life. I am bound to state that she ate an enormous dinner, so I did<br/>not feel any anxiety. But what a lack of taste she showed! The one<br/>charm of the past is that it is the past. But women never know when<br/>the curtain has fallen. They always want a sixth act, and as soon<br/>as the interest of the play is entirely over, they propose to<br/>continue it. If they were allowed their own way, every comedy would<br/>have a tragic ending, and every tragedy would culminate in a farce.<br/>They are charmingly artificial, but they have no sense of art. You<br/>are more fortunate than I am. I assure you, Dorian, that not one of<br/>the women I have known would have done for me what Sibyl Vane did<br/>for you. Ordinary women always console themselves. Some of them do<br/>it by going in for sentimental colours. Never trust a woman who<br/>wears mauve, whatever her age may be, or a woman over thirty-five<br/>who is fond of pink ribbons. It always means that they have a<br/>history. Others find a great consolation in suddenly discovering<br/>the good qualities of their husbands. They flaunt their conjugal<br/>felicity in one's face, as if it were the most fascinating of sins.<br/>Religion consoles some. Its mysteries have all the charm of a<br/>flirtation, a woman once told me, and I can quite understand it.<br/>Besides, nothing makes one so vain as being told that one is a<br/>sinner. Conscience makes egotists of us all. Yes; there is really<br/>no end to the consolations that women find in modern life. Indeed,<br/>I have not mentioned the most important one."<br/><br/>"What is that, Harry?" said the lad listlessly.<br/><br/>"Oh, the obvious consolation. Taking some one else's admirer<br/>when one loses one's own. In good society that always whitewashes a<br/>woman. But really, Dorian, how different Sibyl Vane must have been<br/>from all the women one meets! There is something to me quite<br/>beautiful about her death. I am glad I am living in a century when<br/>such wonders happen. They make one believe in the reality of the<br/>things we all play with, such as romance, passion, and love."<br/><br/>"I was terribly cruel to her. You forget that."<br/><br/>"I am afraid that women appreciate cruelty, downright cruelty,<br/>more than anything else. They have wonderfully primitive instincts.<br/>We have emancipated them, but they remain slaves looking for their<br/>masters, all the same. They love being dominated. I am sure you<br/>were splendid. I have never seen you really and absolutely angry,<br/>but I can fancy how delightful you looked. And, after all, you said<br/>something to me the day before yesterday that seemed to me at the<br/>time to be merely fanciful, but that I see now was absolutely true,<br/>and it holds the key to everything."<br/><br/>"What was that, Harry?"<br/><br/>"You said to me that Sibyl Vane represented to you all the<br/>heroines of romance—that she was Desdemona one night, and Ophelia<br/>the other; that if she died as Juliet, she came to life as<br/>Imogen."<br/>
