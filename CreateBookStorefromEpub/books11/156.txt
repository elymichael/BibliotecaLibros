"There is no use your telling me that you are going to be good,"
cried Lord Henry, dipping his white fingers into a red copper bowl
filled with rose-water. "You are quite perfect. Pray, don't
change."

Dorian Gray shook his head. "No, Harry, I have done too many
dreadful things in my life. I am not going to do any more. I began
my good actions yesterday."

"Where were you yesterday?"

"In the country, Harry. I was staying at a little inn by
myself."

"My dear boy," said Lord Henry, smiling, "anybody can be good in
the country. There are no temptations there. That is the reason why
people who live out of town are so absolutely uncivilized.
Civilization is not by any means an easy thing to attain to. There
are only two ways by which man can reach it. One is by being
cultured, the other by being corrupt. Country people have no
opportunity of being either, so they stagnate."

"Culture and corruption," echoed Dorian. "I have known something
of both. It seems terrible to me now that they should ever be found
together. For I have a new ideal, Harry. I am going to alter. I
think I have altered."
