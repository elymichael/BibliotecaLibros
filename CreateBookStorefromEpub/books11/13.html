<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>2<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>As they entered they saw Dorian Gray. He was seated at the<br/>piano, with his back to them, turning over the pages of a volume of<br/>Schumann's "Forest Scenes." "You must lend me these, Basil," he<br/>cried. "I want to learn them. They are perfectly charming."<br/><br/>"That entirely depends on how you sit to-day, Dorian."<br/><br/>"Oh, I am tired of sitting, and I don't want a life-sized<br/>portrait of myself," answered the lad, swinging round on the<br/>music-stool in a wilful, petulant manner. When he caught sight of<br/>Lord Henry, a faint blush coloured his cheeks for a moment, and he<br/>started up. "I beg your pardon, Basil, but I didn't know you had<br/>any one with you."<br/><br/>"This is Lord Henry Wotton, Dorian, an old Oxford friend of<br/>mine. I have just been telling him what a capital sitter you were,<br/>and now you have spoiled everything."<br/><br/>"You have not spoiled my pleasure in meeting you, Mr. Gray,"<br/>said Lord Henry, stepping forward and extending his hand. "My aunt<br/>has often spoken to me about you. You are one of her favourites,<br/>and, I am afraid, one of her victims also."<br/><br/>"I am in Lady Agatha's black books at present," answered Dorian<br/>with a funny look of penitence. "I promised to go to a club in<br/>Whitechapel with her last Tuesday, and I really forgot all about<br/>it. We were to have played a duet togetherâ€”three duets, I believe.<br/>I don't know what she will say to me. I am far too frightened to<br/>call."<br/><br/>
