<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>15<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>That evening, at eight-thirty, exquisitely dressed and wearing a<br/>large button-hole of Parma violets, Dorian Gray was ushered into<br/>Lady Narborough's drawing-room by bowing servants. His forehead was<br/>throbbing with maddened nerves, and he felt wildly excited, but his<br/>manner as he bent over his hostess's hand was as easy and graceful<br/>as ever. Perhaps one never seems so much at one's ease as when one<br/>has to play a part. Certainly no one looking at Dorian Gray that<br/>night could have believed that he had passed through a tragedy as<br/>horrible as any tragedy of our age. Those finely shaped fingers<br/>could never have clutched a knife for sin, nor those smiling lips<br/>have cried out on God and goodness. He himself could not help<br/>wondering at the calm of his demeanour, and for a moment felt<br/>keenly the terrible pleasure of a double life.<br/><br/>It was a small party, got up rather in a hurry by Lady<br/>Narborough, who was a very clever woman with what Lord Henry used<br/>to describe as the remains of really remarkable ugliness. She had<br/>proved an excellent wife to one of our most tedious ambassadors,<br/>and having buried her husband properly in a marble mausoleum, which<br/>she had herself designed, and married off her daughters to some<br/>rich, rather elderly men, she devoted herself now to the pleasures<br/>of French fiction, French cookery, and French esprit when she could<br/>get it.<br/><br/>Dorian was one of her especial favourites, and she always told<br/>him that she was extremely glad she had not met him in early life.<br/>"I know, my dear, I should have fallen madly in love with you," she<br/>used to say, "and thrown my bonnet right over the mills for your<br/>sake. It is most fortunate that you were not thought of at the<br/>time. As it was, our bonnets were so unbecoming, and the mills were<br/>so occupied in trying to raise the wind, that I never had even a<br/>flirtation with anybody. However, that was all Narborough's fault.<br/>He was dreadfully short-sighted, and there is no pleasure in taking<br/>in a husband who never sees anything."<br/><br/>Her guests this evening were rather tedious. The fact was, as<br/>she explained to Dorian, behind a very shabby fan, one of her<br/>married daughters had come up quite suddenly to stay with her, and,<br/>to make matters worse, had actually brought her husband with her.<br/>"I think it is most unkind of her, my dear," she whispered. "Of<br/>course I go and stay with them every summer after I come from<br/>Homburg, but then an old woman like me must have fresh air<br/>sometimes, and besides, I really wake them up. You don't know what<br/>an existence they lead down there. It is pure unadulterated country<br/>life. They get up early, because they have so much to do, and go to<br/>bed early, because they have so little to think about. There has<br/>not been a scandal in the neighbourhood since the time of Queen<br/>Elizabeth, and consequently they all fall asleep after dinner. You<br/>shan't sit next either of them. You shall sit by me and amuse<br/>me."<br/><br/>Dorian murmured a graceful compliment and looked round the room.<br/>Yes: it was certainly a tedious party. Two of the people he had<br/>never seen before, and the others consisted of Ernest Harrowden,<br/>one of those middle-aged mediocrities so common in London clubs who<br/>have no enemies, but are thoroughly disliked by their friends; Lady<br/>Ruxton, an overdressed woman of forty-seven, with a hooked nose,<br/>who was always trying to get herself compromised, but was so<br/>peculiarly plain that to her great disappointment no one would ever<br/>believe anything against her; Mrs. Erlynne, a pushing nobody, with<br/>a delightful lisp and Venetian-red hair; Lady Alice Chapman, his<br/>hostess's daughter, a dowdy dull girl, with one of those<br/>characteristic British faces that, once seen, are never remembered;<br/>and her husband, a red-cheeked, white-whiskered creature who, like<br/>so many of his class, was under the impression that inordinate<br/>joviality can atone for an entire lack of ideas.<br/><br/>He was rather sorry he had come, till Lady Narborough, looking<br/>at the great ormolu gilt clock that sprawled in gaudy curves on the<br/>mauve-draped mantelshelf, exclaimed: "How horrid of Henry Wotton to<br/>be so late! I sent round to him this morning on chance and he<br/>promised faithfully not to disappoint me."<br/><br/>
