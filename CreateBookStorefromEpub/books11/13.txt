As they entered they saw Dorian Gray. He was seated at the
piano, with his back to them, turning over the pages of a volume of
Schumann's "Forest Scenes." "You must lend me these, Basil," he
cried. "I want to learn them. They are perfectly charming."

"That entirely depends on how you sit to-day, Dorian."

"Oh, I am tired of sitting, and I don't want a life-sized
portrait of myself," answered the lad, swinging round on the
music-stool in a wilful, petulant manner. When he caught sight of
Lord Henry, a faint blush coloured his cheeks for a moment, and he
started up. "I beg your pardon, Basil, but I didn't know you had
any one with you."

"This is Lord Henry Wotton, Dorian, an old Oxford friend of
mine. I have just been telling him what a capital sitter you were,
and now you have spoiled everything."

"You have not spoiled my pleasure in meeting you, Mr. Gray,"
said Lord Henry, stepping forward and extending his hand. "My aunt
has often spoken to me about you. You are one of her favourites,
and, I am afraid, one of her victims also."

"I am in Lady Agatha's black books at present," answered Dorian
with a funny look of penitence. "I promised to go to a club in
Whitechapel with her last Tuesday, and I really forgot all about
it. We were to have played a duet togetherâ€”three duets, I believe.
I don't know what she will say to me. I am far too frightened to
call."
