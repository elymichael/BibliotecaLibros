<br/>"Do you still refuse to do this for me?"<br/><br/>"Of course I refuse. I will have absolutely nothing to do with<br/>it. I don't care what shame comes on you. You deserve it all. I<br/>should not be sorry to see you disgraced, publicly disgraced. How<br/>dare you ask me, of all men in the world, to mix myself up in this<br/>horror? I should have thought you knew more about people's<br/>characters. Your friend Lord Henry Wotton can't have taught you<br/>much about psychology, whatever else he has taught you. Nothing<br/>will induce me to stir a step to help you. You have come to the<br/>wrong man. Go to some of your friends. Don't come to me."<br/><br/>"Alan, it was murder. I killed him. You don't know what he had<br/>made me suffer. Whatever my life is, he had more to do with the<br/>making or the marring of it than poor Harry has had. He may not<br/>have intended it, the result was the same."<br/><br/>"Murder! Good God, Dorian, is that what you have come to? I<br/>shall not inform upon you. It is not my business. Besides, without<br/>my stirring in the matter, you are certain to be arrested. Nobody<br/>ever commits a crime without doing something stupid. But I will<br/>have nothing to do with it."<br/><br/>"You must have something to do with it. Wait, wait a moment;<br/>listen to me. Only listen, Alan. All I ask of you is to perform a<br/>certain scientific experiment. You go to hospitals and dead-houses,<br/>and the horrors that you do there don't affect you. If in some<br/>hideous dissecting-room or fetid laboratory you found this man<br/>lying on a leaden table with red gutters scooped out in it for the<br/>blood to flow through, you would simply look upon him as an<br/>admirable subject. You would not turn a hair. You would not believe<br/>that you were doing anything wrong. On the contrary, you would<br/>probably feel that you were benefiting the human race, or<br/>increasing the sum of knowledge in the world, or gratifying<br/>intellectual curiosity, or something of that kind. What I want you<br/>to do is merely what you have often done before. Indeed, to destroy<br/>a body must be far less horrible than what you are accustomed to<br/>work at. And, remember, it is the only piece of evidence against<br/>me. If it is discovered, I am lost; and it is sure to be discovered<br/>unless you help me."<br/><br/>"I have no desire to help you. You forget that. I am simply<br/>indifferent to the whole thing. It has nothing to do with me."<br/><br/>"Alan, I entreat you. Think of the position I am in. Just before<br/>you came I almost fainted with terror. You may know terror yourself<br/>some day. No! don't think of that. Look at the matter purely from<br/>the scientific point of view. You don't inquire where the dead<br/>things on which you experiment come from. Don't inquire now. I have<br/>told you too much as it is. But I beg of you to do this. We were<br/>friends once, Alan."<br/><br/>"Don't speak about those days, Dorianâ€”they are dead."<br/><br/>"The dead linger sometimes. The man upstairs will not go away.<br/>He is sitting at the table with bowed head and outstretched arms.<br/>Alan! Alan! If you don't come to my assistance, I am ruined. Why,<br/>they will hang me, Alan! Don't you understand? They will hang me<br/>for what I have done."<br/><br/>"There is no good in prolonging this scene. I absolutely refuse<br/>to do anything in the matter. It is insane of you to ask me."<br/><br/>
