Dorian heaved a sigh of relief as he saw the gardener
approaching. The man touched his hat, glanced for a moment at Lord
Henry in a hesitating manner, and then produced a letter, which he
handed to his master. "Her Grace told me to wait for an answer," he
murmured.

Dorian put the letter into his pocket. "Tell her Grace that I am
coming in," he said, coldly. The man turned round and went rapidly
in the direction of the house.

"How fond women are of doing dangerous things!" laughed Lord
Henry. "It is one of the qualities in them that I admire most. A
woman will flirt with anybody in the world as long as other people
are looking on."

"How fond you are of saying dangerous things, Harry! In the
present instance, you are quite astray. I like the duchess very
much, but I don't love her."

"And the duchess loves you very much, but she likes you less, so
you are excellently matched."

"You are talking scandal, Harry, and there is never any basis
for scandal."

"The basis of every scandal is an immoral certainty," said Lord
Henry, lighting a cigarette.

"You would sacrifice anybody, Harry, for the sake of an
epigram."

"The world goes to the altar of its own accord," was the
answer.

"I wish I could love," cried Dorian Gray with a deep note of
pathos in his voice. "But I seem to have lost the passion and
forgotten the desire. I am too much concentrated on myself. My own
personality has become a burden to me. I want to escape, to go
away, to forget. It was silly of me to come down here at all. I
think I shall send a wire to Harvey to have the yacht got ready. On
a yacht one is safe."

"Safe from what, Dorian? You are in some trouble. Why not tell
me what it is? You know I would help you."
