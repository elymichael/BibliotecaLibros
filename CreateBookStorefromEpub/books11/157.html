"You have not yet told me what your good action was. Or did you<br/>say you had done more than one?" asked his companion as he spilled<br/>into his plate a little crimson pyramid of seeded strawberries and,<br/>through a perforated, shell-shaped spoon, snowed white sugar upon<br/>them.<br/><br/>"I can tell you, Harry. It is not a story I could tell to any<br/>one else. I spared somebody. It sounds vain, but you understand<br/>what I mean. She was quite beautiful and wonderfully like Sibyl<br/>Vane. I think it was that which first attracted me to her. You<br/>remember Sibyl, don't you? How long ago that seems! Well, Hetty was<br/>not one of our own class, of course. She was simply a girl in a<br/>village. But I really loved her. I am quite sure that I loved her.<br/>All during this wonderful May that we have been having, I used to<br/>run down and see her two or three times a week. Yesterday she met<br/>me in a little orchard. The apple-blossoms kept tumbling down on<br/>her hair, and she was laughing. We were to have gone away together<br/>this morning at dawn. Suddenly I determined to leave her as<br/>flowerlike as I had found her."<br/><br/>"I should think the novelty of the emotion must have given you a<br/>thrill of real pleasure, Dorian," interrupted Lord Henry. "But I<br/>can finish your idyll for you. You gave her good advice and broke<br/>her heart. That was the beginning of your reformation."<br/><br/>"Harry, you are horrible! You mustn't say these dreadful things.<br/>Hetty's heart is not broken. Of course, she cried and all that. But<br/>there is no disgrace upon her. She can live, like Perdita, in her<br/>garden of mint and marigold."<br/><br/>"And weep over a faithless Florizel," said Lord Henry, laughing,<br/>as he leaned back in his chair. "My dear Dorian, you have the most<br/>curiously boyish moods. Do you think this girl will ever be really<br/>content now with any one of her own rank? I suppose she will be<br/>married some day to a rough carter or a grinning ploughman. Well,<br/>the fact of having met you, and loved you, will teach her to<br/>despise her husband, and she will be wretched. From a moral point<br/>of view, I cannot say that I think much of your great renunciation.<br/>Even as a beginning, it is poor. Besides, how do you know that<br/>Hetty isn't floating at the present moment in some starlit<br/>mill-pond, with lovely water-lilies round her, like Ophelia?"<br/><br/>"I can't bear this, Harry! You mock at everything, and then<br/>suggest the most serious tragedies. I am sorry I told you now. I<br/>don't care what you say to me. I know I was right in acting as I<br/>did. Poor Hetty! As I rode past the farm this morning, I saw her<br/>white face at the window, like a spray of jasmine. Don't let us<br/>talk about it any more, and don't try to persuade me that the first<br/>good action I have done for years, the first little bit of<br/>self-sacrifice I have ever known, is really a sort of sin. I want<br/>to be better. I am going to be better. Tell me something about<br/>yourself. What is going on in town? I have not been to the club for<br/>days."<br/><br/>"The people are still discussing poor Basil's<br/>disappearance."<br/><br/>"I should have thought they had got tired of that by this time,"<br/>said Dorian, pouring himself out some wine and frowning<br/>slightly.<br/><br/>"My dear boy, they have only been talking about it for six<br/>weeks, and the British public are really not equal to the mental<br/>strain of having more than one topic every three months. They have<br/>been very fortunate lately, however. They have had my own<br/>divorce-case and Alan Campbell's suicide. Now they have got the<br/>mysterious disappearance of an artist. Scotland Yard still insists<br/>that the man in the grey ulster who left for Paris by the midnight<br/>train on the ninth of November was poor Basil, and the French<br/>police declare that Basil never arrived in Paris at all. I suppose<br/>in about a fortnight we shall be told that he has been seen in San<br/>Francisco. It is an odd thing, but every one who disappears is said<br/>to be seen at San Francisco. It must be a delightful city, and<br/>possess all the attractions of the next world."<br/><br/>"What do you think has happened to Basil?" asked Dorian, holding<br/>up his Burgundy against the light and wondering how it was that he<br/>could discuss the matter so calmly.<br/><br/>"I have not the slightest idea. If Basil chooses to hide<br/>himself, it is no business of mine. If he is dead, I don't want to<br/>think about him. Death is the only thing that ever terrifies me. I<br/>hate it."<br/>
