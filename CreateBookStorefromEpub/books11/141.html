The duchess turned and looked at Dorian Gray with a curious<br/>expression in her eyes. "What do you say to that, Mr. Gray?" she<br/>inquired.<br/><br/>Dorian hesitated for a moment. Then he threw his head back and<br/>laughed. "I always agree with Harry, Duchess."<br/><br/>"Even when he is wrong?"<br/><br/>"Harry is never wrong, Duchess."<br/><br/>"And does his philosophy make you happy?"<br/><br/>"I have never searched for happiness. Who wants happiness? I<br/>have searched for pleasure."<br/><br/>"And found it, Mr. Gray?"<br/><br/>"Often. Too often."<br/><br/>The duchess sighed. "I am searching for peace," she said, "and<br/>if I don't go and dress, I shall have none this evening."<br/><br/>"Let me get you some orchids, Duchess," cried Dorian, starting<br/>to his feet and walking down the conservatory.<br/><br/>"You are flirting disgracefully with him," said Lord Henry to<br/>his cousin. "You had better take care. He is very fascinating."<br/>
