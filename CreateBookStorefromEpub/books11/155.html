Dorian Gray shuddered. He felt that his could not be the hand to<br/>take the handkerchief away, and called out to one of the<br/>farm-servants to come to him.<br/><br/>"Take that thing off the face. I wish to see it," he said,<br/>clutching at the door-post for support.<br/><br/>When the farm-servant had done so, he stepped forward. A cry of<br/>joy broke from his lips. The man who had been shot in the thicket<br/>was James Vane.<br/><br/>He stood there for some minutes looking at the dead body. As he<br/>rode home, his eyes were full of tears, for he knew he was<br/>safe.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
