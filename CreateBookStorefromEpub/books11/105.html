<br/>Then he remembered the lamp. It was a rather curious one of<br/>Moorish workmanship, made of dull silver inlaid with arabesques of<br/>burnished steel, and studded with coarse turquoises. Perhaps it<br/>might be missed by his servant, and questions would be asked. He<br/>hesitated for a moment, then he turned back and took it from the<br/>table. He could not help seeing the dead thing. How still it was!<br/>How horribly white the long hands looked! It was like a dreadful<br/>wax image.<br/><br/>Having locked the door behind him, he crept quietly downstairs.<br/>The woodwork creaked and seemed to cry out as if in pain. He<br/>stopped several times and waited. No: everything was still. It was<br/>merely the sound of his own footsteps.<br/><br/>When he reached the library, he saw the bag and coat in the<br/>corner. They must be hidden away somewhere. He unlocked a secret<br/>press that was in the wainscoting, a press in which he kept his own<br/>curious disguises, and put them into it. He could easily burn them<br/>afterwards. Then he pulled out his watch. It was twenty minutes to<br/>two.<br/><br/>He sat down and began to think. Every year—every month, almost—<br/>men were strangled in England for what he had done. There had been<br/>a madness of murder in the air. Some red star had come too close to<br/>the earth… . And yet, what evidence was there against him? Basil<br/>Hallward had left the house at eleven. No one had seen him come in<br/>again. Most of the servants were at Selby Royal. His valet had gone<br/>to bed… . Paris! Yes. It was to Paris that Basil had gone, and by<br/>the midnight train, as he had intended. With his curious reserved<br/>habits, it would be months before any suspicions would be roused.<br/>Months! Everything could be destroyed long before then.<br/><br/>A sudden thought struck him. He put on his fur coat and hat and<br/>went out into the hall. There he paused, hearing the slow heavy<br/>tread of the policeman on the pavement outside and seeing the flash<br/>of the bull's-eye reflected in the window. He waited and held his<br/>breath.<br/><br/>After a few moments he drew back the latch and slipped out,<br/>shutting the door very gently behind him. Then he began ringing the<br/>bell. In about five minutes his valet appeared, half-dressed and<br/>looking very drowsy.<br/><br/>"I am sorry to have had to wake you up, Francis," he said,<br/>stepping in; "but I had forgotten my latch-key. What time is<br/>it?"<br/><br/>"Ten minutes past two, sir," answered the man, looking at the<br/>clock and blinking.<br/><br/>"Ten minutes past two? How horribly late! You must wake me at<br/>nine to-morrow. I have some work to do."<br/><br/>"All right, sir."<br/><br/>
