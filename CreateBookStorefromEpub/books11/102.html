The voice that spoke was cold and cruel. "You are mad, Dorian,<br/>or playing a part," muttered Hallward, frowning.<br/><br/>"You won't? Then I must do it myself," said the young man, and<br/>he tore the curtain from its rod and flung it on the ground.<br/><br/>An exclamation of horror broke from the painter's lips as he saw<br/>in the dim light the hideous face on the canvas grinning at him.<br/>There was something in its expression that filled him with disgust<br/>and loathing. Good heavens! it was Dorian Gray's own face that he<br/>was looking at! The horror, whatever it was, had not yet entirely<br/>spoiled that marvellous beauty. There was still some gold in the<br/>thinning hair and some scarlet on the sensual mouth. The sodden<br/>eyes had kept something of the loveliness of their blue, the noble<br/>curves had not yet completely passed away from chiselled nostrils<br/>and from plastic throat. Yes, it was Dorian himself. But who had<br/>done it? He seemed to recognize his own brushwork, and the frame<br/>was his own design. The idea was monstrous, yet he felt afraid. He<br/>seized the lighted candle, and held it to the picture. In the<br/>left-hand corner was his own name, traced in long letters of bright<br/>vermilion.<br/><br/>It was some foul parody, some infamous ignoble satire. He had<br/>never done that. Still, it was his own picture. He knew it, and he<br/>felt as if his blood had changed in a moment from fire to sluggish<br/>ice. His own picture! What did it mean? Why had it altered? He<br/>turned and looked at Dorian Gray with the eyes of a sick man. His<br/>mouth twitched, and his parched tongue seemed unable to articulate.<br/>He passed his hand across his forehead. It was dank with clammy<br/>sweat.<br/><br/>The young man was leaning against the mantelshelf, watching him<br/>with that strange expression that one sees on the faces of those<br/>who are absorbed in a play when some great artist is acting. There<br/>was neither real sorrow in it nor real joy. There was simply the<br/>passion of the spectator, with perhaps a flicker of triumph in his<br/>eyes. He had taken the flower out of his coat, and was smelling it,<br/>or pretending to do so.<br/><br/>"What does this mean?" cried Hallward, at last. His own voice<br/>sounded shrill and curious in his ears.<br/><br/>"Years ago, when I was a boy," said Dorian Gray, crushing the<br/>flower in his hand, "you met me, flattered me, and taught me to be<br/>vain of my good looks. One day you introduced me to a friend of<br/>yours, who explained to me the wonder of youth, and you finished a<br/>portrait of me that revealed to me the wonder of beauty. In a mad<br/>moment that, even now, I don't know whether I regret or not, I made<br/>a wish, perhaps you would call it a prayerâ€¦ ."<br/><br/>"I remember it! Oh, how well I remember it! No! the thing is<br/>impossible. The room is damp. Mildew has got into the canvas. The<br/>paints I used had some wretched mineral poison in them. I tell you<br/>the thing is impossible."<br/><br/>"Ah, what is impossible?" murmured the young man, going over to<br/>the window and leaning his forehead against the cold, mist-stained<br/>glass.<br/><br/>"You told me you had destroyed it."<br/><br/>"I was wrong. It has destroyed me."<br/>
