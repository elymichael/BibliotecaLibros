<br/>"I can't tell you, Harry," he answered sadly. "And I dare say it<br/>is only a fancy of mine. This unfortunate accident has upset me. I<br/>have a horrible presentiment that something of the kind may happen<br/>to me."<br/><br/>"What nonsense!"<br/><br/>"I hope it is, but I can't help feeling it. Ah! here is the<br/>duchess, looking like Artemis in a tailor-made gown. You see we<br/>have come back, Duchess."<br/><br/>"I have heard all about it, Mr. Gray," she answered. "Poor<br/>Geoffrey is terribly upset. And it seems that you asked him not to<br/>shoot the hare. How curious!"<br/><br/>"Yes, it was very curious. I don't know what made me say it.<br/>Some whim, I suppose. It looked the loveliest of little live<br/>things. But I am sorry they told you about the man. It is a hideous<br/>subject."<br/><br/>"It is an annoying subject," broke in Lord Henry. "It has no<br/>psychological value at all. Now if Geoffrey had done the thing on<br/>purpose, how interesting he would be! I should like to know some<br/>one who had committed a real murder."<br/><br/>"How horrid of you, Harry!" cried the duchess. "Isn't it, Mr.<br/>Gray? Harry, Mr. Gray is ill again. He is going to faint."<br/><br/>Dorian drew himself up with an effort and smiled. "It is<br/>nothing, Duchess," he murmured; "my nerves are dreadfully out of<br/>order. That is all. I am afraid I walked too far this morning. I<br/>didn't hear what Harry said. Was it very bad? You must tell me some<br/>other time. I think I must go and lie down. You will excuse me,<br/>won't you?"<br/><br/>They had reached the great flight of steps that led from the<br/>conservatory on to the terrace. As the glass door closed behind<br/>Dorian, Lord Henry turned and looked at the duchess with his<br/>slumberous eyes. "Are you very much in love with him?" he<br/>asked.<br/><br/>She did not answer for some time, but stood gazing at the<br/>landscape. "I wish I knew," she said at last.<br/><br/>
