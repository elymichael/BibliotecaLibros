Dorian Gray shook his head. "I left her in the forest of Arden;<br/>I shall find her in an orchard in Verona."<br/><br/>Lord Henry sipped his champagne in a meditative manner. "At what<br/>particular point did you mention the word marriage, Dorian? And<br/>what did she say in answer? Perhaps you forgot all about it."<br/><br/>"My dear Harry, I did not treat it as a business transaction,<br/>and I did not make any formal proposal. I told her that I loved<br/>her, and she said she was not worthy to be my wife. Not worthy!<br/>Why, the whole world is nothing to me compared with her."<br/><br/>"Women are wonderfully practical," murmured Lord Henry, "much<br/>more practical than we are. In situations of that kind we often<br/>forget to say anything about marriage, and they always remind<br/>us."<br/><br/>Hallward laid his hand upon his arm. "Don't, Harry. You have<br/>annoyed Dorian. He is not like other men. He would never bring<br/>misery upon any one. His nature is too fine for that."<br/><br/>Lord Henry looked across the table. "Dorian is never annoyed<br/>with me," be answered. "I asked the question for the best reason<br/>possible, for the only reason, indeed, that excuses one for asking<br/>any question— simple curiosity. I have a theory that it is always<br/>the women who propose to us, and not we who propose to the women.<br/>Except, of course, in middle-class life. But then the middle<br/>classes are not modern."<br/><br/>Dorian Gray laughed, and tossed his head. "You are quite<br/>incorrigible, Harry; but I don't mind. It is impossible to be angry<br/>with you. When you see Sibyl Vane, you will feel that the man who<br/>could wrong her would be a beast, a beast without a heart. I cannot<br/>understand how any one can wish to shame the thing he loves. I love<br/>Sibyl Vane. I want to place her on a pedestal of gold and to see<br/>the world worship the woman who is mine. What is marriage? An<br/>irrevocable vow. You mock at it for that. Ah! don't mock. It is an<br/>irrevocable vow that I want to take. Her trust makes me faithful,<br/>her belief makes me good. When I am with her, I regret all that you<br/>have taught me. I become different from what you have known me to<br/>be. I am changed, and the mere touch of Sibyl Vane's hand makes me<br/>forget you and all your wrong, fascinating, poisonous, delightful<br/>theories."<br/><br/>"And those are&#160;… &#160;?" asked Lord Henry, helping himself<br/>to some salad.<br/><br/>"Oh, your theories about life, your theories about love, your<br/>theories about pleasure. All your theories, in fact, Harry."<br/><br/>"Pleasure is the only thing worth having a theory about," he<br/>answered in his slow melodious voice. "But I am afraid I cannot<br/>claim my theory as my own. It belongs to Nature, not to me.<br/>Pleasure is Nature's test, her sign of approval. When we are happy,<br/>we are always good, but when we are good, we are not always<br/>happy."<br/><br/>"Ah! but what do you mean by good?" cried Basil Hallward.<br/>
