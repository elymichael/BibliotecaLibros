<br/>When the second act was over, there came a storm of hisses, and<br/>Lord Henry got up from his chair and put on his coat. "She is quite<br/>beautiful, Dorian," he said, "but she can't act. Let us go."<br/><br/>"I am going to see the play through," answered the lad, in a<br/>hard bitter voice. "I am awfully sorry that I have made you waste<br/>an evening, Harry. I apologize to you both."<br/><br/>"My dear Dorian, I should think Miss Vane was ill," interrupted<br/>Hallward. "We will come some other night."<br/><br/>"I wish she were ill," he rejoined. "But she seems to me to be<br/>simply callous and cold. She has entirely altered. Last night she<br/>was a great artist. This evening she is merely a commonplace<br/>mediocre actress."<br/><br/>"Don't talk like that about any one you love, Dorian. Love is a<br/>more wonderful thing than art."<br/><br/>"They are both simply forms of imitation," remarked Lord Henry.<br/>"But do let us go. Dorian, you must not stay here any longer. It is<br/>not good for one's morals to see bad acting. Besides, I don't<br/>suppose you will want your wife to act, so what does it matter if<br/>she plays Juliet like a wooden doll? She is very lovely, and if she<br/>knows as little about life as she does about acting, she will be a<br/>delightful experience. There are only two kinds of people who are<br/>really fascinatingâ€” people who know absolutely everything, and<br/>people who know absolutely nothing. Good heavens, my dear boy,<br/>don't look so tragic! The secret of remaining young is never to<br/>have an emotion that is unbecoming. Come to the club with Basil and<br/>myself. We will smoke cigarettes and drink to the beauty of Sibyl<br/>Vane. She is beautiful. What more can you want?"<br/><br/>"Go away, Harry," cried the lad. "I want to be alone. Basil, you<br/>must go. Ah! can't you see that my heart is breaking?" The hot<br/>tears came to his eyes. His lips trembled, and rushing to the back<br/>of the box, he leaned up against the wall, hiding his face in his<br/>hands.<br/><br/>"Let us go, Basil," said Lord Henry with a strange tenderness in<br/>his voice, and the two young men passed out together.<br/><br/>A few moments afterwards the footlights flared up and the<br/>curtain rose on the third act. Dorian Gray went back to his seat.<br/>He looked pale, and proud, and indifferent. The play dragged on,<br/>and seemed interminable. Half of the audience went out, tramping in<br/>heavy boots and laughing. The whole thing was a fiasco. The last<br/>act was played to almost empty benches. The curtain went down on a<br/>titter and some groans.<br/><br/>As soon as it was over, Dorian Gray rushed behind the scenes<br/>into the greenroom. The girl was standing there alone, with a look<br/>of triumph on her face. Her eyes were lit with an exquisite fire.<br/>There was a radiance about her. Her parted lips were smiling over<br/>some secret of their own.<br/><br/>
