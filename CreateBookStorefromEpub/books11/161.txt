"Yet you poisoned me with a book once. I should not forgive
that. Harry, promise me that you will never lend that book to any
one. It does harm."

"My dear boy, you are really beginning to moralize. You will
soon be going about like the converted, and the revivalist, warning
people against all the sins of which you have grown tired. You are
much too delightful to do that. Besides, it is no use. You and I
are what we are, and will be what we will be. As for being poisoned
by a book, there is no such thing as that. Art has no influence
upon action. It annihilates the desire to act. It is superbly
sterile. The books that the world calls immoral are books that show
the world its own shame. That is all. But we won't discuss
literature. Come round to-morrow. I am going to ride at eleven. We
might go together, and I will take you to lunch afterwards with
Lady Branksome. She is a charming woman, and wants to consult you
about some tapestries she is thinking of buying. Mind you come. Or
shall we lunch with our little duchess? She says she never sees you
now. Perhaps you are tired of Gladys? I thought you would be. Her
clever tongue gets on one's nerves. Well, in any case, be here at
eleven."

"Must I really come, Harry?"

"Certainly. The park is quite lovely now. I don't think there
have been such lilacs since the year I met you."

"Very well. I shall be here at eleven," said Dorian. "Good
night, Harry." As he reached the door, he hesitated for a moment,
as if he had something more to say. Then he sighed and went
out.
