<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>16<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>A cold rain began to fall, and the blurred street-lamps looked<br/>ghastly in the dripping mist. The public-houses were just closing,<br/>and dim men and women were clustering in broken groups round their<br/>doors. From some of the bars came the sound of horrible laughter.<br/>In others, drunkards brawled and screamed.<br/><br/>Lying back in the hansom, with his hat pulled over his forehead,<br/>Dorian Gray watched with listless eyes the sordid shame of the<br/>great city, and now and then he repeated to himself the words that<br/>Lord Henry had said to him on the first day they had met, "To cure<br/>the soul by means of the senses, and the senses by means of the<br/>soul." Yes, that was the secret. He had often tried it, and would<br/>try it again now. There were opium dens where one could buy<br/>oblivion, dens of horror where the memory of old sins could be<br/>destroyed by the madness of sins that were new.<br/><br/>The moon hung low in the sky like a yellow skull. From time to<br/>time a huge misshapen cloud stretched a long arm across and hid it.<br/>The gas-lamps grew fewer, and the streets more narrow and gloomy.<br/>Once the man lost his way and had to drive back half a mile. A<br/>steam rose from the horse as it splashed up the puddles. The<br/>sidewindows of the hansom were clogged with a grey-flannel<br/>mist.<br/><br/>"To cure the soul by means of the senses, and the senses by<br/>means of the soul!" How the words rang in his ears! His soul,<br/>certainly, was sick to death. Was it true that the senses could<br/>cure it? Innocent blood had been spilled. What could atone for<br/>that? Ah! for that there was no atonement; but though forgiveness<br/>was impossible, forgetfulness was possible still, and he was<br/>determined to forget, to stamp the thing out, to crush it as one<br/>would crush the adder that had stung one. Indeed, what right had<br/>Basil to have spoken to him as he had done? Who had made him a<br/>judge over others? He had said things that were dreadful, horrible,<br/>not to be endured.<br/><br/>On and on plodded the hansom, going slower, it seemed to him, at<br/>each step. He thrust up the trap and called to the man to drive<br/>faster. The hideous hunger for opium began to gnaw at him. His<br/>throat burned and his delicate hands twitched nervously together.<br/>He struck at the horse madly with his stick. The driver laughed and<br/>whipped up. He laughed in answer, and the man was silent.<br/><br/>The way seemed interminable, and the streets like the black web<br/>of some sprawling spider. The monotony became unbearable, and as<br/>the mist thickened, he felt afraid.<br/><br/>
