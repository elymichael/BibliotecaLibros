As soon as he was dressed, he went into the library and sat down<br/>to a light French breakfast that had been laid out for him on a<br/>small round table close to the open window. It was an exquisite<br/>day. The warm air seemed laden with spices. A bee flew in and<br/>buzzed round the blue-dragon bowl that, filled with sulphur-yellow<br/>roses, stood before him. He felt perfectly happy.<br/><br/>Suddenly his eye fell on the screen that he had placed in front<br/>of the portrait, and he started.<br/><br/>"Too cold for Monsieur?" asked his valet, putting an omelette on<br/>the table. "I shut the window?"<br/><br/>Dorian shook his head. "I am not cold," he murmured.<br/><br/>Was it all true? Had the portrait really changed? Or had it been<br/>simply his own imagination that had made him see a look of evil<br/>where there had been a look of joy? Surely a painted canvas could<br/>not alter? The thing was absurd. It would serve as a tale to tell<br/>Basil some day. It would make him smile.<br/><br/>And, yet, how vivid was his recollection of the whole thing!<br/>First in the dim twilight, and then in the bright dawn, he had seen<br/>the touch of cruelty round the warped lips. He almost dreaded his<br/>valet leaving the room. He knew that when he was alone he would<br/>have to examine the portrait. He was afraid of certainty. When the<br/>coffee and cigarettes had been brought and the man turned to go, he<br/>felt a wild desire to tell him to remain. As the door was closing<br/>behind him, he called him back. The man stood waiting for his<br/>orders. Dorian looked at him for a moment. "I am not at home to any<br/>one, Victor," he said with a sigh. The man bowed and retired.<br/><br/>Then he rose from the table, lit a cigarette, and flung himself<br/>down on a luxuriously cushioned couch that stood facing the screen.<br/>The screen was an old one, of gilt Spanish leather, stamped and<br/>wrought with a rather florid Louis-Quatorze pattern. He scanned it<br/>curiously, wondering if ever before it had concealed the secret of<br/>a man's life.<br/><br/>Should he move it aside, after all? Why not let it stay there?<br/>What was the use of knowing.? If the thing was true, it was<br/>terrible. If it was not true, why trouble about it? But what if, by<br/>some fate or deadlier chance, eyes other than his spied behind and<br/>saw the horrible change? What should he do if Basil Hallward came<br/>and asked to look at his own picture? Basil would be sure to do<br/>that. No; the thing had to be examined, and at once. Anything would<br/>be better than this dreadful state of doubt.<br/><br/>He got up and locked both doors. At least he would be alone when<br/>he looked upon the mask of his shame. Then he drew the screen aside<br/>and saw himself face to face. It was perfectly true. The portrait<br/>had altered.<br/><br/>As he often remembered afterwards, and always with no small<br/>wonder, he found himself at first gazing at the portrait with a<br/>feeling of almost scientific interest. That such a change should<br/>have taken place was incredible to him. And yet it was a fact. Was<br/>there some subtle affinity between the chemical atoms that shaped<br/>themselves into form and colour on the canvas and the soul that was<br/>within him? Could it be that what that soul thought, they<br/>realized?â€”that what it dreamed, they made true? Or was there some<br/>other, more terrible reason? He shuddered, and felt afraid, and,<br/>going back to the couch, lay there, gazing at the picture in<br/>sickened horror.<br/><br/>One thing, however, he felt that it had done for him. It had<br/>made him conscious how unjust, how cruel, he had been to Sibyl<br/>Vane. It was not too late to make reparation for that. She could<br/>still be his wife. His unreal and selfish love would yield to some<br/>higher influence, would be transformed into some nobler passion,<br/>and the portrait that Basil Hallward had painted of him would be a<br/>guide to him through life, would be to him what holiness is to<br/>some, and conscience to others, and the fear of God to us all.<br/>There were opiates for remorse, drugs that could lull the moral<br/>sense to sleep. But here was a visible symbol of the degradation of<br/>sin. Here was an ever-present sign of the ruin men brought upon<br/>their souls.<br/>
