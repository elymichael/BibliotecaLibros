Lord Henry looked over at Mr. Erskine. "Humanity takes itself
too seriously. It is the world's original sin. If the caveman had
known how to laugh, history would have been different."

"You are really very comforting," warbled the duchess. "I have
always felt rather guilty when I came to see your dear aunt, for I
take no interest at all in the East End. For the future I shall be
able to look her in the face without a blush."

"A blush is very becoming, Duchess," remarked Lord Henry.

"Only when one is young," she answered. "When an old woman like
myself blushes, it is a very bad sign. Ah! Lord Henry, I wish you
would tell me how to become young again."

He thought for a moment. "Can you remember any great error that
you committed in your early days, Duchess?" he asked, looking at
her across the table.

"A great many, I fear," she cried.

"Then commit them over again," he said gravely. "To get back
one's youth, one has merely to repeat one's follies."

"A delightful theory!" she exclaimed. "I must put it into
practice."

"A dangerous theory!" came from Sir Thomas's tight lips. Lady
Agatha shook her head, but could not help being amused. Mr. Erskine
listened.

"Yes," he continued, "that is one of the great secrets of life.
Nowadays most people die of a sort of creeping common sense, and
discover when it is too late that the only things one never regrets
are one's mistakes."

A laugh ran round the table.
