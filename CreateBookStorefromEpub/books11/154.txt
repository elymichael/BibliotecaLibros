"Yes, sir. He looks as if he had been a sort of sailor; tattooed
on both arms, and that kind of thing."

"Was there anything found on him?" said Dorian, leaning forward
and looking at the man with startled eyes. "Anything that would
tell his name?"

"Some money, sirâ€”not much, and a six-shooter. There was no name
of any kind. A decent-looking man, sir, but rough-like. A sort of
sailor we think."

Dorian started to his feet. A terrible hope fluttered past him.
He clutched at it madly. "Where is the body?" he exclaimed. "Quick!
I must see it at once."

"It is in an empty stable in the Home Farm, sir. The folk don't
like to have that sort of thing in their houses. They say a corpse
brings bad luck."

"The Home Farm! Go there at once and meet me. Tell one of the
grooms to bring my horse round. No. Never mind. I'll go to the
stables myself. It will save time."

In less than a quarter of an hour, Dorian Gray was galloping
down the long avenue as hard as he could go. The trees seemed to
sweep past him in spectral procession, and wild shadows to fling
themselves across his path. Once the mare swerved at a white
gate-post and nearly threw him. He lashed her across the neck with
his crop. She cleft the dusky air like an arrow. The stones flew
from her hoofs.

At last he reached the Home Farm. Two men were loitering in the
yard. He leaped from the saddle and threw the reins to one of them.
In the farthest stable a light was glimmering. Something seemed to
tell him that the body was there, and he hurried to the door and
put his hand upon the latch.

There he paused for a moment, feeling that he was on the brink
of a discovery that would either make or mar his life. Then he
thrust the door open and entered.

On a heap of sacking in the far corner was lying the dead body
of a man dressed in a coarse shirt and a pair of blue trousers. A
spotted handkerchief had been placed over the face. A coarse
candle, stuck in a bottle, sputtered beside it.
