A week later Dorian Gray was sitting in the conservatory at
Selby Royal, talking to the pretty Duchess of Monmouth, who with
her husband, a jaded-looking man of sixty, was amongst his guests.
It was tea-time, and the mellow light of the huge, lace-covered
lamp that stood on the table lit up the delicate china and hammered
silver of the service at which the duchess was presiding. Her white
hands were moving daintily among the cups, and her full red lips
were smiling at something that Dorian had whispered to her. Lord
Henry was lying back in a silk-draped wicker chair, looking at
them. On a peach-coloured divan sat Lady Narborough, pretending to
listen to the duke's description of the last Brazilian beetle that
he had added to his collection. Three young men in elaborate
smoking-suits were handing tea-cakes to some of the women. The
house-party consisted of twelve people, and there were more
expected to arrive on the next day.

"What are you two talking about?" said Lord Henry, strolling
over to the table and putting his cup down. "I hope Dorian has told
you about my plan for rechristening everything, Gladys. It is a
delightful idea."

"But I don't want to be rechristened, Harry," rejoined the
duchess, looking up at him with her wonderful eyes. "I am quite
satisfied with my own name, and I am sure Mr. Gray should be
satisfied with his."

"My dear Gladys, I would not alter either name for the world.
They are both perfect. I was thinking chiefly of flowers. Yesterday
I cut an orchid, for my button-hole. It was a marvellous spotted
thing, as effective as the seven deadly sins. In a thoughtless
moment I asked one of the gardeners what it was called. He told me
it was a fine specimen of Robinsoniana, or something dreadful of
that kind. It is a sad truth, but we have lost the faculty of
giving lovely names to things. Names are everything. I never
quarrel with actions. My one quarrel is with words. That is the
reason I hate vulgar realism in literature. The man who could call
a spade a spade should be compelled to use one. It is the only
thing he is fit for."

"Then what should we call you, Harry?" she asked.

"His name is Prince Paradox," said Dorian.
