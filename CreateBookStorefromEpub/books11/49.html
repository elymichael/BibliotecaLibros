Sibyl Vane tossed her head and laughed. "We don't want him any<br/>more, Mother. Prince Charming rules life for us now." Then she<br/>paused. A rose shook in her blood and shadowed her cheeks. Quick<br/>breath parted the petals of her lips. They trembled. Some southern<br/>wind of passion swept over her and stirred the dainty folds of her<br/>dress. "I love him," she said simply.<br/><br/>"Foolish child! foolish child!" was the parrot-phrase flung in<br/>answer. The waving of crooked, false-jewelled fingers gave<br/>grotesqueness to the words.<br/><br/>The girl laughed again. The joy of a caged bird was in her<br/>voice. Her eyes caught the melody and echoed it in radiance, then<br/>closed for a moment, as though to hide their secret. When they<br/>opened, the mist of a dream had passed across them.<br/><br/>Thin-lipped wisdom spoke at her from the worn chair, hinted at<br/>prudence, quoted from that book of cowardice whose author apes the<br/>name of common sense. She did not listen. She was free in her<br/>prison of passion. Her prince, Prince Charming, was with her. She<br/>had called on memory to remake him. She had sent her soul to search<br/>for him, and it had brought him back. His kiss burned again upon<br/>her mouth. Her eyelids were warm with his breath.<br/><br/>Then wisdom altered its method and spoke of espial and<br/>discovery. This young man might be rich. If so, marriage should be<br/>thought of. Against the shell of her ear broke the waves of worldly<br/>cunning. The arrows of craft shot by her. She saw the thin lips<br/>moving, and smiled.<br/><br/>Suddenly she felt the need to speak. The wordy silence troubled<br/>her. "Mother, Mother," she cried, "why does he love me so much? I<br/>know why I love him. I love him because he is like what love<br/>himself should be. But what does he see in me? I am not worthy of<br/>him. And yet—why, I cannot tell—though I feel so much beneath him,<br/>I don't feel humble. I feel proud, terribly proud. Mother, did you<br/>love my father as I love Prince Charming?"<br/><br/>The elder woman grew pale beneath the coarse powder that daubed<br/>her cheeks, and her dry lips twitched with a spasm of pain. Sybil<br/>rushed to her, flung her arms round her neck, and kissed her.<br/>"Forgive me, Mother. I know it pains you to talk about our father.<br/>But it only pains you because you loved him so much. Don't look so<br/>sad. I am as happy to-day as you were twenty years ago. Ah! let me<br/>be happy for ever!"<br/><br/>"My child, you are far too young to think of falling in love.<br/>Besides, what do you know of this young man? You don't even know<br/>his name. The whole thing is most inconvenient, and really, when<br/>James is going away to Australia, and I have so much to think of, I<br/>must say that you should have shown more consideration. However, as<br/>I said before, if he is rich&#160;… "<br/><br/>"Ah! Mother, Mother, let me be happy!"<br/><br/>Mrs. Vane glanced at her, and with one of those false theatrical<br/>gestures that so often become a mode of second nature to a<br/>stage-player, clasped her in her arms. At this moment, the door<br/>opened and a young lad with rough brown hair came into the room. He<br/>was thick-set of figure, and his hands and feet were large and<br/>somewhat clumsy in movement. He was not so finely bred as his<br/>sister. One would hardly have guessed the close relationship that<br/>existed between them. Mrs. Vane fixed her eyes on him and<br/>intensified her smile. She mentally elevated her son to the dignity<br/>of an audience. She felt sure that the tableau was interesting.<br/><br/>"You might keep some of your kisses for me, Sibyl, I think,"<br/>said the lad with a good-natured grumble.<br/>
