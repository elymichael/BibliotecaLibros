"What has the actual lapse of time got to do with it? It is only
shallow people who require years to get rid of an emotion. A man
who is master of himself can end a sorrow as easily as he can
invent a pleasure. I don't want to be at the mercy of my emotions.
I want to use them, to enjoy them, and to dominate them."

"Dorian, this is horrible! Something has changed you completely.
You look exactly the same wonderful boy who, day after day, used to
come down to my studio to sit for his picture. But you were simple,
natural, and affectionate then. You were the most unspoiled
creature in the whole world. Now, I don't know what has come over
you. You talk as if you had no heart, no pity in you. It is all
Harry's influence. I see that."

The lad flushed up and, going to the window, looked out for a
few moments on the green, flickering, sun-lashed garden. "I owe a
great deal to Harry, Basil," he said at last, "more than I owe to
you. You only taught me to be vain."

"Well, I am punished for that, Dorian—or shall be some day."

"I don't know what you mean, Basil," he exclaimed, turning
round. "I don't know what you want. What do you want?"

"I want the Dorian Gray I used to paint," said the artist
sadly.

"Basil," said the lad, going over to him and putting his hand on
his shoulder, "you have come too late. Yesterday, when I heard that
Sibyl Vane had killed herself—"

"Killed herself! Good heavens! is there no doubt about that?"
cried Hallward, looking up at him with an expression of horror.

"My dear Basil! Surely you don't think it was a vulgar accident?
Of course she killed herself."

The elder man buried his face in his hands. "How fearful," he
muttered, and a shudder ran through him.

"No," said Dorian Gray, "there is nothing fearful about it. It
is one of the great romantic tragedies of the age. As a rule,
people who act lead the most commonplace lives. They are good
husbands, or faithful wives, or something tedious. You know what I
mean—middle-class virtue and all that kind of thing. How different
Sibyl was! She lived her finest tragedy. She was always a heroine.
The last night she played— the night you saw her—she acted badly
because she had known the reality of love. When she knew its
unreality, she died, as Juliet might have died. She passed again
into the sphere of art. There is something of the martyr about her.
Her death has all the pathetic uselessness of martyrdom, all its
wasted beauty. But, as I was saying, you must not think I have not
suffered. If you had come in yesterday at a particular moment—
about half-past five, perhaps, or a quarter to six— you would have
found me in tears. Even Harry, who was here, who brought me the
news, in fact, had no idea what I was going through. I suffered
immensely. Then it passed away. I cannot repeat an emotion. No one
can, except sentimentalists. And you are awfully unjust, Basil. You
come down here to console me. That is charming of you. You find me
consoled, and you are furious. How like a sympathetic person! You
remind me of a story Harry told me about a certain philanthropist
who spent twenty years of his life in trying to get some grievance
redressed, or some unjust law altered—I forget exactly what it was.
Finally he succeeded, and nothing could exceed his disappointment.
He had absolutely nothing to do, almost died of ennui, and became a
confirmed misanthrope. And besides, my dear old Basil, if you
really want to console me, teach me rather to forget what has
happened, or to see it from a proper artistic point of view. Was it
not Gautier who used to write about la consolation des arts? I
remember picking up a little vellum-covered book in your studio one
day and chancing on that delightful phrase. Well, I am not like
that young man you told me of when we were down at Marlow together,
the young man who used to say that yellow satin could console one
for all the miseries of life. I love beautiful things that one can
touch and handle. Old brocades, green bronzes, lacquer-work, carved
ivories, exquisite surroundings, luxury, pomp—there is much to be
got from all these. But the artistic temperament that they create,
or at any rate reveal, is still more to me. To become the spectator
of one's own life, as Harry says, is to escape the suffering of
life. I know you are surprised at my talking to you like this. You
have not realized how I have developed. I was a schoolboy when you
knew me. I am a man now. I have new passions, new thoughts, new
ideas. I am different, but you must not like me less. I am changed,
but you must always be my friend. Of course, I am very fond of
Harry. But I know that you are better than he is. You are not
stronger— you are too much afraid of life—but you are better. And
how happy we used to be together! Don't leave me, Basil, and don't
quarrel with me. I am what I am. There is nothing more to be
said."
