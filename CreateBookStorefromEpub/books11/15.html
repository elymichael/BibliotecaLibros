<br/>"Stay, Harry, to oblige Dorian, and to oblige me," said<br/>Hallward, gazing intently at his picture. "It is quite true, I<br/>never talk when I am working, and never listen either, and it must<br/>be dreadfully tedious for my unfortunate sitters. I beg you to<br/>stay."<br/><br/>"But what about my man at the Orleans?"<br/><br/>The painter laughed. "I don't think there will be any difficulty<br/>about that. Sit down again, Harry. And now, Dorian, get up on the<br/>platform, and don't move about too much, or pay any attention to<br/>what Lord Henry says. He has a very bad influence over all his<br/>friends, with the single exception of myself."<br/><br/>Dorian Gray stepped up on the dais with the air of a young Greek<br/>martyr, and made a little moue of discontent to Lord Henry, to whom<br/>he had rather taken a fancy. He was so unlike Basil. They made a<br/>delightful contrast. And he had such a beautiful voice. After a few<br/>moments he said to him, "Have you really a very bad influence, Lord<br/>Henry? As bad as Basil says?"<br/><br/>"There is no such thing as a good influence, Mr. Gray. All<br/>influence is immoral—immoral from the scientific point of<br/>view."<br/><br/>"Why?"<br/><br/>"Because to influence a person is to give him one's own soul. He<br/>does not think his natural thoughts, or burn with his natural<br/>passions. His virtues are not real to him. His sins, if there are<br/>such things as sins, are borrowed. He becomes an echo of some one<br/>else's music, an actor of a part that has not been written for him.<br/>The aim of life is self-development. To realize one's nature<br/>perfectly—that is what each of us is here for. People are afraid of<br/>themselves, nowadays. They have forgotten the highest of all<br/>duties, the duty that one owes to one's self. Of course, they are<br/>charitable. They feed the hungry and clothe the beggar. But their<br/>own souls starve, and are naked. Courage has gone out of our race.<br/>Perhaps we never really had it. The terror of society, which is the<br/>basis of morals, the terror of God, which is the secret of<br/>religion—these are the two things that govern us. And yet—"<br/><br/>"Just turn your head a little more to the right, Dorian, like a<br/>good boy," said the painter, deep in his work and conscious only<br/>that a look had come into the lad's face that he had never seen<br/>there before.<br/><br/>"And yet," continued Lord Henry, in his low, musical voice, and<br/>with that graceful wave of the hand that was always so<br/>characteristic of him, and that he had even in his Eton days, "I<br/>believe that if one man were to live out his life fully and<br/>completely, were to give form to every feeling, expression to every<br/>thought, reality to every dream—I believe that the world would gain<br/>such a fresh impulse of joy that we would forget all the maladies<br/>of mediaevalism, and return to the Hellenic ideal— to something<br/>finer, richer than the Hellenic ideal, it may be. But the bravest<br/>man amongst us is afraid of himself. The mutilation of the savage<br/>has its tragic survival in the self-denial that mars our lives. We<br/>are punished for our refusals. Every impulse that we strive to<br/>strangle broods in the mind and poisons us. The body sins once, and<br/>has done with its sin, for action is a mode of purification.<br/>Nothing remains then but the recollection of a pleasure, or the<br/>luxury of a regret. The only way to get rid of a temptation is to<br/>yield to it. Resist it, and your soul grows sick with longing for<br/>the things it has forbidden to itself, with desire for what its<br/>monstrous laws have made monstrous and unlawful. It has been said<br/>that the great events of the world take place in the brain. It is<br/>in the brain, and the brain only, that the great sins of the world<br/>take place also. You, Mr. Gray, you yourself, with your rose-red<br/>youth and your rose-white boyhood, you have had passions that have<br/>made you afraid, thoughts that have filled you with terror,<br/>day-dreams and sleeping dreams whose mere memory might stain your<br/>cheek with shame—"<br/><br/>"Stop!" faltered Dorian Gray, "stop! you bewilder me. I don't<br/>know what to say. There is some answer to you, but I cannot find<br/>it. Don't speak. Let me think. Or, rather, let me try not to<br/>think."<br/><br/>
