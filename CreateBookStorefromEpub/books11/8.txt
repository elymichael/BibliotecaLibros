"My dear fellow, she tried to found a salon, and only succeeded
in opening a restaurant. How could I admire her? But tell me, what
did she say about Mr. Dorian Gray?"

"Oh, something like, 'Charming boy—poor dear mother and I
absolutely inseparable. Quite forget what he does—afraid he—
doesn't do anything—oh, yes, plays the piano—or is it the violin,
dear Mr. Gray?' Neither of us could help laughing, and we became
friends at once."

"Laughter is not at all a bad beginning for a friendship, and it
is far the best ending for one," said the young lord, plucking
another daisy.

Hallward shook his head. "You don't understand what friendship
is, Harry," he murmured—"or what enmity is, for that matter. You
like every one; that is to say, you are indifferent to every
one."

"How horribly unjust of you!" cried Lord Henry, tilting his hat
back and looking up at the little clouds that, like ravelled skeins
of glossy white silk, were drifting across the hollowed turquoise
of the summer sky. "Yes; horribly unjust of you. I make a great
difference between people. I choose my friends for their good
looks, my acquaintances for their good characters, and my enemies
for their good intellects. A man cannot be too careful in the
choice of his enemies. I have not got one who is a fool. They are
all men of some intellectual power, and consequently they all
appreciate me. Is that very vain of me? I think it is rather
vain."

"I should think it was, Harry. But according to your category I
must be merely an acquaintance."

"My dear old Basil, you are much more than an acquaintance."

"And much less than a friend. A sort of brother, I suppose?"

"Oh, brothers! I don't care for brothers. My elder brother won't
die, and my younger brothers seem never to do anything else."

"Harry!" exclaimed Hallward, frowning.
