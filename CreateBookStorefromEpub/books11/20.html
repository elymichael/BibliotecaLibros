"Whose property is it?"<br/><br/>"Dorian's, of course," answered the painter.<br/><br/>"He is a very lucky fellow."<br/><br/>"How sad it is!" murmured Dorian Gray with his eyes still fixed<br/>upon his own portrait. "How sad it is! I shall grow old, and<br/>horrible, and dreadful. But this picture will remain always young.<br/>It will never be older than this particular day of June… . If it<br/>were only the other way! If it were I who was to be always young,<br/>and the picture that was to grow old! For that—for that—I would<br/>give everything! Yes, there is nothing in the whole world I would<br/>not give! I would give my soul for that!"<br/><br/>"You would hardly care for such an arrangement, Basil," cried<br/>Lord Henry, laughing. "It would be rather hard lines on your<br/>work."<br/><br/>"I should object very strongly, Harry," said Hallward.<br/><br/>Dorian Gray turned and looked at him. "I believe you would,<br/>Basil. You like your art better than your friends. I am no more to<br/>you than a green bronze figure. Hardly as much, I dare say."<br/><br/>The painter stared in amazement. It was so unlike Dorian to<br/>speak like that. What had happened? He seemed quite angry. His face<br/>was flushed and his cheeks burning.<br/><br/>"Yes," he continued, "I am less to you than your ivory Hermes or<br/>your silver Faun. You will like them always. How long will you like<br/>me? Till I have my first wrinkle, I suppose. I know, now, that when<br/>one loses one's good looks, whatever they may be, one loses<br/>everything. Your picture has taught me that. Lord Henry Wotton is<br/>perfectly right. Youth is the only thing worth having. When I find<br/>that I am growing old, I shall kill myself."<br/><br/>Hallward turned pale and caught his hand. "Dorian! Dorian!" he<br/>cried, "don't talk like that. I have never had such a friend as<br/>you, and I shall never have such another. You are not jealous of<br/>material things, are you?— you who are finer than any of them!"<br/><br/>"I am jealous of everything whose beauty does not die. I am<br/>jealous of the portrait you have painted of me. Why should it keep<br/>what I must lose? Every moment that passes takes something from me<br/>and gives something to it. Oh, if it were only the other way! If<br/>the picture could change, and I could be always what I am now! Why<br/>did you paint it? It will mock me some day—mock me horribly!" The<br/>hot tears welled into his eyes; he tore his hand away and, flinging<br/>himself on the divan, he buried his face in the cushions, as though<br/>he was praying.<br/>
