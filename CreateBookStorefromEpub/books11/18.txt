Dorian Gray listened, open-eyed and wondering. The spray of
lilac fell from his hand upon the gravel. A furry bee came and
buzzed round it for a moment. Then it began to scramble all over
the oval stellated globe of the tiny blossoms. He watched it with
that strange interest in trivial things that we try to develop when
things of high import make us afraid, or when we are stirred by
some new emotion for which we cannot find expression, or when some
thought that terrifies us lays sudden siege to the brain and calls
on us to yield. After a time the bee flew away. He saw it creeping
into the stained trumpet of a Tyrian convolvulus. The flower seemed
to quiver, and then swayed gently to and fro.

Suddenly the painter appeared at the door of the studio and made
staccato signs for them to come in. They turned to each other and
smiled.

"I am waiting," he cried. "Do come in. The light is quite
perfect, and you can bring your drinks."

They rose up and sauntered down the walk together. Two
green-and-white butterflies fluttered past them, and in the
pear-tree at the corner of the garden a thrush began to sing.

"You are glad you have met me, Mr. Gray," said Lord Henry,
looking at him.

"Yes, I am glad now. I wonder shall I always be glad?"

"Always! That is a dreadful word. It makes me shudder when I
hear it. Women are so fond of using it. They spoil every romance by
trying to make it last for ever. It is a meaningless word, too. The
only difference between a caprice and a lifelong passion is that
the caprice lasts a little longer."

As they entered the studio, Dorian Gray put his hand upon Lord
Henry's arm. "In that case, let our friendship be a caprice," he
murmured, flushing at his own boldness, then stepped up on the
platform and resumed his pose.

Lord Henry flung himself into a large wicker arm-chair and
watched him. The sweep and dash of the brush on the canvas made the
only sound that broke the stillness, except when, now and then,
Hallward stepped back to look at his work from a distance. In the
slanting beams that streamed through the open doorway the dust
danced and was golden. The heavy scent of the roses seemed to brood
over everything.

After about a quarter of an hour Hallward stopped painting,
looked for a long time at Dorian Gray, and then for a long time at
the picture, biting the end of one of his huge brushes and
frowning. "It is quite finished," he cried at last, and stooping
down he wrote his name in long vermilion letters on the left-hand
corner of the canvas.

Lord Henry came over and examined the picture. It was certainly
a wonderful work of art, and a wonderful likeness as well.
