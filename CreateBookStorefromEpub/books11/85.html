<br/>"Impossible!"<br/><br/>"You spoil my life as an artist by refusing, Dorian. No man<br/>comes across two ideal things. Few come across one."<br/><br/>"I can't explain it to you, Basil, but I must never sit to you<br/>again. There is something fatal about a portrait. It has a life of<br/>its own. I will come and have tea with you. That will be just as<br/>pleasant."<br/><br/>"Pleasanter for you, I am afraid," murmured Hallward<br/>regretfully. "And now good-bye. I am sorry you won't let me look at<br/>the picture once again. But that can't be helped. I quite<br/>understand what you feel about it."<br/><br/>As he left the room, Dorian Gray smiled to himself. Poor Basil!<br/>How little he knew of the true reason! And bow strange it was that,<br/>instead of having been forced to reveal his own secret, he had<br/>succeeded, almost by chance, in wresting a secret from his friend!<br/>How much that strange confession explained to him! The painter's<br/>absurd fits of jealousy, his wild devotion, his extravagant<br/>panegyrics, his curious reticencesâ€” he understood them all now, and<br/>he felt sorry. There seemed to him to be something tragic in a<br/>friendship so coloured by romance.<br/><br/>He sighed and touched the bell. The portrait must be hidden away<br/>at all costs. He could not run such a risk of discovery again. It<br/>had been mad of him to have allowed the thing to remain, even for<br/>an hour, in a room to which any of his friends had access.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
