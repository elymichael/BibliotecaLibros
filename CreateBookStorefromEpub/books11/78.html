"We are only at the beginning of our friendship, Dorian,"<br/>answered Lord Henry, shaking him by the hand. "Good-bye. I shall<br/>see you before nine-thirty, I hope. Remember, Patti is<br/>singing."<br/><br/>As he closed the door behind him, Dorian Gray touched the bell,<br/>and in a few minutes Victor appeared with the lamps and drew the<br/>blinds down. He waited impatiently for him to go. The man seemed to<br/>take an interminable time over everything.<br/><br/>As soon as he had left, he rushed to the screen and drew it<br/>back. No; there was no further change in the picture. It had<br/>received the news of Sibyl Vane's death before he had known of it<br/>himself. It was conscious of the events of life as they occurred.<br/>The vicious cruelty that marred the fine lines of the mouth had, no<br/>doubt, appeared at the very moment that the girl had drunk the<br/>poison, whatever it was. Or was it indifferent to results? Did it<br/>merely take cognizance of what passed within the soul? He wondered,<br/>and hoped that some day he would see the change taking place before<br/>his very eyes, shuddering as he hoped it.<br/><br/>Poor Sibyl! What a romance it had all been! She had often<br/>mimicked death on the stage. Then Death himself had touched her and<br/>taken her with him. How had she played that dreadful last scene?<br/>Had she cursed him, as she died? No; she had died for love of him,<br/>and love would always be a sacrament to him now. She had atoned for<br/>everything by the sacrifice she had made of her life. He would not<br/>think any more of what she had made him go through, on that<br/>horrible night at the theatre. When he thought of her, it would be<br/>as a wonderful tragic figure sent on to the world's stage to show<br/>the supreme reality of love. A wonderful tragic figure? Tears came<br/>to his eyes as he remembered her childlike look, and winsome<br/>fanciful ways, and shy tremulous grace. He brushed them away<br/>hastily and looked again at the picture.<br/><br/>He felt that the time had really come for making his choice. Or<br/>had his choice already been made? Yes, life had decided that for<br/>him—life, and his own infinite curiosity about life. Eternal youth,<br/>infinite passion, pleasures subtle and secret, wild joys and wilder<br/>sins—he was to have all these things. The portrait was to bear the<br/>burden of his shame: that was all.<br/><br/>A feeling of pain crept over him as he thought of the<br/>desecration that was in store for the fair face on the canvas.<br/>Once, in boyish mockery of Narcissus, he had kissed, or feigned to<br/>kiss, those painted lips that now smiled so cruelly at him. Morning<br/>after morning he had sat before the portrait wondering at its<br/>beauty, almost enamoured of it, as it seemed to him at times. Was<br/>it to alter now with every mood to which he yielded? Was it to<br/>become a monstrous and loathsome thing, to be hidden away in a<br/>locked room, to be shut out from the sunlight that had so often<br/>touched to brighter gold the waving wonder of its hair? The pity of<br/>it! the pity of it!<br/><br/>For a moment, he thought of praying that the horrible sympathy<br/>that existed between him and the picture might cease. It had<br/>changed in answer to a prayer; perhaps in answer to a prayer it<br/>might remain unchanged. And yet, who, that knew anything about<br/>life, would surrender the chance of remaining always young, however<br/>fantastic that chance might be, or with what fateful consequences<br/>it might be fraught? Besides, was it really under his control? Had<br/>it indeed been prayer that had produced the substitution? Might<br/>there not be some curious scientific reason for it all? If thought<br/>could exercise its influence upon a living organism, might not<br/>thought exercise an influence upon dead and inorganic things? Nay,<br/>without thought or conscious desire, might not things external to<br/>ourselves vibrate in unison with our moods and passions, atom<br/>calling to atom in secret love or strange affinity? But the reason<br/>was of no importance. He would never again tempt by a prayer any<br/>terrible power. If the picture was to alter, it was to alter. That<br/>was all. Why inquire too closely into it?<br/><br/>For there would be a real pleasure in watching it. He would be<br/>able to follow his mind into its secret places. This portrait would<br/>be to him the most magical of mirrors. As it had revealed to him<br/>his own body, so it would reveal to him his own soul. And when<br/>winter came upon it, he would still be standing where spring<br/>trembles on the verge of summer. When the blood crept from its<br/>face, and left behind a pallid mask of chalk with leaden eyes, he<br/>would keep the glamour of boyhood. Not one blossom of his<br/>loveliness would ever fade. Not one pulse of his life would ever<br/>weaken. Like the gods of the Greeks, he would be strong, and fleet,<br/>and joyous. What did it matter what happened to the coloured image<br/>on the canvas? He would be safe. That was everything.<br/><br/>He drew the screen back into its former place in front of the<br/>picture, smiling as he did so, and passed into his bedroom, where<br/>his valet was already waiting for him. An hour later he was at the<br/>opera, and Lord Henry was leaning over his chair.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
