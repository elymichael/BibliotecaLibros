<br/>He discovered wonderful stories, also, about jewels. In<br/>Alphonso's Clericalis Disciplina a serpent was mentioned with eyes<br/>of real jacinth, and in the romantic history of Alexander, the<br/>Conqueror of Emathia was said to have found in the vale of Jordan<br/>snakes "with collars of real emeralds growing on their backs."<br/>There was a gem in the brain of the dragon, Philostratus told us,<br/>and "by the exhibition of golden letters and a scarlet robe" the<br/>monster could be thrown into a magical sleep and slain. According<br/>to the great alchemist, Pierre de Boniface, the diamond rendered a<br/>man invisible, and the agate of India made him eloquent. The<br/>cornelian appeased anger, and the hyacinth provoked sleep, and the<br/>amethyst drove away the fumes of wine. The garnet cast out demons,<br/>and the hydropicus deprived the moon of her colour. The selenite<br/>waxed and waned with the moon, and the meloceus, that discovers<br/>thieves, could be affected only by the blood of kids. Leonardus<br/>Camillus had seen a white stone taken from the brain of a newly<br/>killed toad, that was a certain antidote against poison. The<br/>bezoar, that was found in the heart of the Arabian deer, was a<br/>charm that could cure the plague. In the nests of Arabian birds was<br/>the aspilates, that, according to Democritus, kept the wearer from<br/>any danger by fire.<br/><br/>The King of Ceilan rode through his city with a large ruby in<br/>his hand, as the ceremony of his coronation. The gates of the<br/>palace of John the Priest were "made of sardius, with the horn of<br/>the horned snake inwrought, so that no man might bring poison<br/>within." Over the gable were "two golden apples, in which were two<br/>carbuncles," so that the gold might shine by day and the carbuncles<br/>by night. In Lodge's strange romance 'A Margarite of America', it<br/>was stated that in the chamber of the queen one could behold "all<br/>the chaste ladies of the world, inchased out of silver, looking<br/>through fair mirrours of chrysolites, carbuncles, sapphires, and<br/>greene emeraults." Marco Polo had seen the inhabitants of Zipangu<br/>place rose-coloured pearls in the mouths of the dead. A sea-monster<br/>had been enamoured of the pearl that the diver brought to King<br/>Perozes, and had slain the thief, and mourned for seven moons over<br/>its loss. When the Huns lured the king into the great pit, he flung<br/>it away— Procopius tells the story—nor was it ever found again,<br/>though the Emperor Anastasius offered five hundred-weight of gold<br/>pieces for it. The King of Malabar had shown to a certain Venetian<br/>a rosary of three hundred and four pearls, one for every god that<br/>he worshipped.<br/><br/>When the Duke de Valentinois, son of Alexander VI, visited Louis<br/>XII of France, his horse was loaded with gold leaves, according to<br/>Brantome, and his cap had double rows of rubies that threw out a<br/>great light. Charles of England had ridden in stirrups hung with<br/>four hundred and twenty-one diamonds. Richard II had a coat, valued<br/>at thirty thousand marks, which was covered with balas rubies. Hall<br/>described Henry VIII, on his way to the Tower previous to his<br/>coronation, as wearing "a jacket of raised gold, the placard<br/>embroidered with diamonds and other rich stones, and a great<br/>bauderike about his neck of large balasses." The favourites of<br/>James I wore ear-rings of emeralds set in gold filigrane. Edward II<br/>gave to Piers Gaveston a suit of red-gold armour studded with<br/>jacinths, a collar of gold roses set with turquoise-stones, and a<br/>skull-cap parseme with pearls. Henry II wore jewelled gloves<br/>reaching to the elbow, and had a hawk-glove sewn with twelve rubies<br/>and fifty-two great orients. The ducal hat of Charles the Rash, the<br/>last Duke of Burgundy of his race, was hung with pear-shaped pearls<br/>and studded with sapphires.<br/><br/>How exquisite life had once been! How gorgeous in its pomp and<br/>decoration! Even to read of the luxury of the dead was<br/>wonderful.<br/><br/>Then he turned his attention to embroideries and to the<br/>tapestries that performed the office of frescoes in the chill rooms<br/>of the northern nations of Europe. As he investigated the subject—<br/>and he always had an extraordinary faculty of becoming absolutely<br/>absorbed for the moment in whatever he took up—he was almost<br/>saddened by the reflection of the ruin that time brought on<br/>beautiful and wonderful things. He, at any rate, had escaped that.<br/>Summer followed summer, and the yellow jonquils bloomed and died<br/>many times, and nights of horror repeated the story of their shame,<br/>but he was unchanged. No winter marred his face or stained his<br/>flowerlike bloom. How different it was with material things! Where<br/>had they passed to? Where was the great crocus-coloured robe, on<br/>which the gods fought against the giants, that had been worked by<br/>brown girls for the pleasure of Athena? Where the huge velarium<br/>that Nero had stretched across the Colosseum at Rome, that Titan<br/>sail of purple on which was represented the starry sky, and Apollo<br/>driving a chariot drawn by white, gilt-reined steeds? He longed to<br/>see the curious table-napkins wrought for the Priest of the Sun, on<br/>which were displayed all the dainties and viands that could be<br/>wanted for a feast; the mortuary cloth of King Chilperic, with its<br/>three hundred golden bees; the fantastic robes that excited the<br/>indignation of the Bishop of Pontus and were figured with "lions,<br/>panthers, bears, dogs, forests, rocks, hunters—all, in fact, that a<br/>painter can copy from nature"; and the coat that Charles of Orleans<br/>once wore, on the sleeves of which were embroidered the verses of a<br/>song beginning "Madame, je suis tout joyeux," the musical<br/>accompaniment of the words being wrought in gold thread, and each<br/>note, of square shape in those days, formed with four pearls. He<br/>read of the room that was prepared at the palace at Rheims for the<br/>use of Queen Joan of Burgundy and was decorated with "thirteen<br/>hundred and twenty-one parrots, made in broidery, and blazoned with<br/>the king's arms, and five hundred and sixty-one butterflies, whose<br/>wings were similarly ornamented with the arms of the queen, the<br/>whole worked in gold." Catherine de Medicis had a mourning-bed made<br/>for her of black velvet powdered with crescents and suns. Its<br/>curtains were of damask, with leafy wreaths and garlands, figured<br/>upon a gold and silver ground, and fringed along the edges with<br/>broideries of pearls, and it stood in a room hung with rows of the<br/>queen's devices in cut black velvet upon cloth of silver. Louis XIV<br/>had gold embroidered caryatides fifteen feet high in his apartment.<br/>The state bed of Sobieski, King of Poland, was made of Smyrna gold<br/>brocade embroidered in turquoises with verses from the Koran. Its<br/>supports were of silver gilt, beautifully chased, and profusely set<br/>with enamelled and jewelled medallions. It had been taken from the<br/>Turkish camp before Vienna, and the standard of Mohammed had stood<br/>beneath the tremulous gilt of its canopy.<br/><br/>And so, for a whole year, he sought to accumulate the most<br/>exquisite specimens that he could find of textile and embroidered<br/>work, getting the dainty Delhi muslins, finely wrought with<br/>gold-thread palmates and stitched over with iridescent beetles'<br/>wings; the Dacca gauzes, that from their transparency are known in<br/>the East as "woven air," and "running water," and "evening dew";<br/>strange figured cloths from Java; elaborate yellow Chinese<br/>hangings; books bound in tawny satins or fair blue silks and<br/>wrought with fleurs-de-lis, birds and images; veils of lacis worked<br/>in Hungary point; Sicilian brocades and stiff Spanish velvets;<br/>Georgian work, with its gilt coins, and Japanese Foukousas, with<br/>their green-toned golds and their marvellously plumaged birds.<br/><br/>He had a special passion, also, for ecclesiastical vestments, as<br/>indeed he had for everything connected with the service of the<br/>Church. In the long cedar chests that lined the west gallery of his<br/>house, he had stored away many rare and beautiful specimens of what<br/>is really the raiment of the Bride of Christ, who must wear purple<br/>and jewels and fine linen that she may hide the pallid macerated<br/>body that is worn by the suffering that she seeks for and wounded<br/>by self-inflicted pain. He possessed a gorgeous cope of crimson<br/>silk and gold-thread damask, figured with a repeating pattern of<br/>golden pomegranates set in six-petalled formal blossoms, beyond<br/>which on either side was the pine-apple device wrought in<br/>seed-pearls. The orphreys were divided into panels representing<br/>scenes from the life of the Virgin, and the coronation of the<br/>Virgin was figured in coloured silks upon the hood. This was<br/>Italian work of the fifteenth century. Another cope was of green<br/>velvet, embroidered with heart-shaped groups of acanthus-leaves,<br/>from which spread long-stemmed white blossoms, the details of which<br/>were picked out with silver thread and coloured crystals. The morse<br/>bore a seraph's head in gold-thread raised work. The orphreys were<br/>woven in a diaper of red and gold silk, and were starred with<br/>medallions of many saints and martyrs, among whom was St.<br/>Sebastian. He had chasubles, also, of amber-coloured silk, and blue<br/>silk and gold brocade, and yellow silk damask and cloth of gold,<br/>figured with representations of the Passion and Crucifixion of<br/>Christ, and embroidered with lions and peacocks and other emblems;<br/>dalmatics of white satin and pink silk damask, decorated with<br/>tulips and dolphins and fleurs-de-lis; altar frontals of crimson<br/>velvet and blue linen; and many corporals, chalice-veils, and<br/>sudaria. In the mystic offices to which such things were put, there<br/>was something that quickened his imagination.<br/><br/>For these treasures, and everything that he collected in his<br/>lovely house, were to be to him means of forgetfulness, modes by<br/>which he could escape, for a season, from the fear that seemed to<br/>him at times to be almost too great to be borne. Upon the walls of<br/>the lonely locked room where he had spent so much of his boyhood,<br/>he had hung with his own hands the terrible portrait whose changing<br/>features showed him the real degradation of his life, and in front<br/>of it had draped the purple-and-gold pall as a curtain. For weeks<br/>he would not go there, would forget the hideous painted thing, and<br/>get back his light heart, his wonderful joyousness, his passionate<br/>absorption in mere existence. Then, suddenly, some night he would<br/>creep out of the house, go down to dreadful places near Blue Gate<br/>Fields, and stay there, day after day, until he was driven away. On<br/>his return he would sit in front of the her times, with that pride<br/>of individualism that is half the fascination of sin, and smiling<br/>with secret pleasure at the misshapen shadow that had to bear the<br/>burden that should have been his own.<br/><br/>After a few years he could not endure to be long out of England,<br/>and gave up the villa that he had shared at Trouville with Lord<br/>Henry, as well as the little white walled-in house at Algiers where<br/>they had more than once spent the winter. He hated to be separated<br/>from the picture that was such a part of his life, and was also<br/>afraid that during his absence some one might gain access to the<br/>room, in spite of the elaborate bars that he had caused to be<br/>placed upon the door.<br/><br/>He was quite conscious that this would tell them nothing. It was<br/>true that the portrait still preserved, under all the foulness and<br/>ugliness of the face, its marked likeness to himself; but what<br/>could they learn from that? He would laugh at any one who tried to<br/>taunt him. He had not painted it. What was it to him how vile and<br/>full of shame it looked? Even if he told them, would they believe<br/>it?<br/><br/>
