<br/><br/>About Wilde:<br/><br/>Oscar Fingal O'Flahertie Wills Wilde (October 16, 1854 â€“<br/>November 30, 1900) was an Irish playwright, novelist, poet, and<br/>short story writer. Known for his barbed wit, he was one of the<br/>most successful playwrights of late Victorian London, and one of<br/>the greatest celebrities of his day. As the result of a famous<br/>trial, he suffered a dramatic downfall and was imprisoned for two<br/>years of hard labour after being convicted of the offence of "gross<br/>indecency". The scholar H. Montgomery Hyde suggests this term<br/>implies homosexual acts not amounting to buggery in British<br/>legislation of the time.
