Upstairs, in his own room, Dorian Gray was lying on a sofa, with<br/>terror in every tingling fibre of his body. Life had suddenly<br/>become too hideous a burden for him to bear. The dreadful death of<br/>the unlucky beater, shot in the thicket like a wild animal, had<br/>seemed to him to pre-figure death for himself also. He had nearly<br/>swooned at what Lord Henry had said in a chance mood of cynical<br/>jesting.<br/><br/>At five o'clock he rang his bell for his servant and gave him<br/>orders to pack his things for the night-express to town, and to<br/>have the brougham at the door by eight-thirty. He was determined<br/>not to sleep another night at Selby Royal. It was an ill-omened<br/>place. Death walked there in the sunlight. The grass of the forest<br/>had been spotted with blood.<br/><br/>Then he wrote a note to Lord Henry, telling him that he was<br/>going up to town to consult his doctor and asking him to entertain<br/>his guests in his absence. As he was putting it into the envelope,<br/>a knock came to the door, and his valet informed him that the<br/>head-keeper wished to see him. He frowned and bit his lip. "Send<br/>him in," he muttered, after some moments' hesitation.<br/><br/>As soon as the man entered, Dorian pulled his chequebook out of<br/>a drawer and spread it out before him.<br/><br/>"I suppose you have come about the unfortunate accident of this<br/>morning, Thornton?" he said, taking up a pen.<br/><br/>"Yes, sir," answered the gamekeeper.<br/><br/>"Was the poor fellow married? Had he any people dependent on<br/>him?" asked Dorian, looking bored. "If so, I should not like them<br/>to be left in want, and will send them any sum of money you may<br/>think necessary."<br/><br/>"We don't know who he is, sir. That is what I took the liberty<br/>of coming to you about."<br/><br/>"Don't know who he is?" said Dorian, listlessly. "What do you<br/>mean? Wasn't he one of your men?"<br/><br/>"No, sir. Never saw him before. Seems like a sailor, sir."<br/><br/>The pen dropped from Dorian Gray's hand, and he felt as if his<br/>heart had suddenly stopped beating. "A sailor?" he cried out. "Did<br/>you say a sailor?"<br/>
