It is so sombre, so depressing.<br/>Sin is the only real colour-element left in modern life."<br/><br/>"You really must not say things like that before Dorian,<br/>Harry."<br/><br/>"Before which Dorian? The one who is pouring out tea for us, or<br/>the one in the picture?"<br/><br/>"Before either."<br/><br/>"I should like to come to the theatre with you, Lord Henry,"<br/>said the lad.<br/><br/>"Then you shall come; and you will come, too, Basil, won't<br/>you?"<br/><br/>"I can't, really. I would sooner not. I have a lot of work to<br/>do."<br/><br/>"Well, then, you and I will go alone, Mr. Gray."<br/><br/>"I should like that awfully."<br/><br/>The painter bit his lip and walked over, cup in hand, to the<br/>picture.
