such an ideal as I shall never meet again. This is the face of a
satyr."

"It is the face of my soul."

"Christ! what a thing I must have worshipped! It has the eyes of
a devil."

"Each of us has heaven and hell in him, Basil," cried Dorian
with a wild gesture of despair.

Hallward turned again to the portrait and gazed at it. "My God!
If it is true," he exclaimed, "and this is what you have done with
your life, why, you must be worse even than those who talk against

examined it. The surface seemed to be quite undisturbed and as he
had left it. It was from within, apparently, that the foulness and
horror had come. Through some strange quickening of inner life the
leprosies of sin were slowly eating the thing away. The rotting of
a corpse in a watery grave was not so fearful.

and lay there sputtering. He placed his foot on it and put it out.
Then he flung himself into the rickety chair that was standing by
the table and buried his face in his hands.
