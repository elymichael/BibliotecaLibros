"Not seventeen, Lady Henry?"<br/><br/>"Well, eighteen, then. And I saw you with him the other night at<br/>the opera." She laughed nervously as she spoke, and watched him<br/>with her vague forget-me-not eyes. She was a curious woman, whose<br/>dresses always looked as if they had been designed in a rage and<br/>put on in a tempest. She was usually in love with somebody, and, as<br/>her passion was never returned, she had kept all her illusions. She<br/>tried to look picturesque, but only succeeded in being untidy. Her<br/>name was Victoria, and she had a perfect mania for going to<br/>church.<br/><br/>"That was at Lohengrin, Lady Henry, I think?"<br/><br/>"Yes; it was at dear Lohengrin. I like Wagner's music better<br/>than anybody's. It is so loud that one can talk the whole time<br/>without other people hearing what one says. That is a great<br/>advantage, don't you think so, Mr. Gray?"<br/><br/>The same nervous staccato laugh broke from her thin lips, and<br/>her fingers began to play with a long tortoise-shell<br/>paper-knife.<br/><br/>Dorian smiled and shook his head: "I am afraid I don't think so,<br/>Lady Henry. I never talk during music—at least, during good music.<br/>If one hears bad music, it is one's duty to drown it in<br/>conversation."<br/><br/>"Ah! that is one of Harry's views, isn't it, Mr. Gray? I always<br/>hear Harry's views from his friends. It is the only way I get to<br/>know of them. But you must not think I don't like good music. I<br/>adore it, but I am afraid of it. It makes me too romantic. I have<br/>simply worshipped pianists— two at a time, sometimes, Harry tells<br/>me. I don't know what it is about them. Perhaps it is that they are<br/>foreigners. They all are, ain't they? Even those that are born in<br/>England become foreigners after a time, don't they? It is so clever<br/>of them, and such a compliment to art. Makes it quite cosmopolitan,<br/>doesn't it? You have never been to any of my parties, have you, Mr.<br/>Gray? You must come. I can't afford orchids, but I share no expense<br/>in foreigners. They make one's rooms look so picturesque. But here<br/>is Harry! Harry, I came in to look for you, to ask you something— I<br/>forget what it was—and I found Mr. Gray here. We have had such a<br/>pleasant chat about music. We have quite the same ideas. No; I<br/>think our ideas are quite different. But he has been most pleasant.<br/>I am so glad I've seen him."<br/><br/>"I am charmed, my love, quite charmed," said Lord Henry,<br/>elevating his dark, crescent-shaped eyebrows and looking at them<br/>both with an amused smile. "So sorry I am late, Dorian. I went to<br/>look after a piece of old brocade in Wardour Street and had to<br/>bargain for hours for it. Nowadays people know the price of<br/>everything and the value of nothing."<br/><br/>"I am afraid I must be going," exclaimed Lady Henry, breaking an<br/>awkward silence with her silly sudden laugh. "I have promised to<br/>drive with the duchess. Good-bye, Mr. Gray. Good-bye, Harry. You<br/>are dining out, I suppose? So am I. Perhaps I shall see you at Lady<br/>Thornbury's."<br/><br/>"I dare say, my dear," said Lord Henry, shutting the door behind<br/>her as, looking like a bird of paradise that had been out all night<br/>in the rain, she flitted out of the room, leaving a faint odour of<br/>frangipanni. Then he lit a cigarette and flung himself down on the<br/>sofa.<br/><br/>"Never marry a woman with straw-coloured hair, Dorian," he said<br/>after a few puffs.<br/>
