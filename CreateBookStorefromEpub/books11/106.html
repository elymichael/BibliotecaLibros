"Did any one call this evening?"<br/><br/>"Mr. Hallward, sir. He stayed here till eleven, and then be went<br/>away to catch his train."<br/><br/>"Oh! I am sorry I didn't see him. Did he leave any message?"<br/><br/>"No, sir, except that he would write to you from Paris, if he<br/>did not find you at the club."<br/><br/>"That will do, Francis. Don't forget to call me at nine<br/>to-morrow."<br/><br/>"No, sir."<br/><br/>The man shambled down the passage in his slippers.<br/><br/>Dorian Gray threw his hat and coat upon the table and passed<br/>into the library. For a quarter of an hour he walked up and down<br/>the room, biting his lip and thinking. Then he took down the Blue<br/>Book from one of the shelves and began to turn over the leaves.<br/>"Alan Campbell, 152, Hertford Street, Mayfair." Yes; that was the<br/>man he wanted.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
