<br/>"It is quite true, Dorian," said Lord Henry, gravely. "It is in<br/>all the morning papers. I wrote down to you to ask you not to see<br/>any one till I came. There will have to be an inquest, of course,<br/>and you must not be mixed up in it. Things like that make a man<br/>fashionable in Paris. But in London people are so prejudiced. Here,<br/>one should never make one's debut with a scandal. One should<br/>reserve that to give an interest to one's old age. I suppose they<br/>don't know your name at the theatre? If they don't, it is all<br/>right. Did any one see you going round to her room? That is an<br/>important point."<br/><br/>Dorian did not answer for a few moments. He was dazed with<br/>horror. Finally he stammered, in a stifled voice, "Harry, did you<br/>say an inquest? What did you mean by that? Did Sibyl—? Oh, Harry, I<br/>can't bear it! But be quick. Tell me everything at once."<br/><br/>"I have no doubt it was not an accident, Dorian, though it must<br/>be put in that way to the public. It seems that as she was leaving<br/>the theatre with her mother, about half-past twelve or so, she said<br/>she had forgotten something upstairs. They waited some time for<br/>her, but she did not come down again. They ultimately found her<br/>lying dead on the floor of her dressing-room. She had swallowed<br/>something by mistake, some dreadful thing they use at theatres. I<br/>don't know what it was, but it had either prussic acid or white<br/>lead in it. I should fancy it was prussic acid, as she seems to<br/>have died instantaneously."<br/><br/>"Harry, Harry, it is terrible!" cried the lad.<br/><br/>"Yes; it is very tragic, of course, but you must not get<br/>yourself mixed up in it. I see by The Standard that she was<br/>seventeen. I should have thought she was almost younger than that.<br/>She looked such a child, and seemed to know so little about acting.<br/>Dorian, you mustn't let this thing get on your nerves. You must<br/>come and dine with me, and afterwards we will look in at the opera.<br/>It is a Patti night, and everybody will be there. You can come to<br/>my sister's box. She has got some smart women with her."<br/><br/>"So I have murdered Sibyl Vane," said Dorian Gray, half to<br/>himself, "murdered her as surely as if I had cut her little throat<br/>with a knife. Yet the roses are not less lovely for all that. The<br/>birds sing just as happily in my garden. And to-night I am to dine<br/>with you, and then go on to the opera, and sup somewhere, I<br/>suppose, afterwards. How extraordinarily dramatic life is! If I had<br/>read all this in a book, Harry, I think I would have wept over it.<br/>Somehow, now that it has happened actually, and to me, it seems far<br/>too wonderful for tears. Here is the first passionate love-letter I<br/>have ever written in my life. Strange, that my first passionate<br/>love-letter should have been addressed to a dead girl. Can they<br/>feel, I wonder, those white silent people we call the dead? Sibyl!<br/>Can she feel, or know, or listen? Oh, Harry, how I loved her once!<br/>It seems years ago to me now. She was everything to me. Then came<br/>that dreadful night—was it really only last night?— when she played<br/>so badly, and my heart almost broke. She explained it all to me. It<br/>was terribly pathetic. But I was not moved a bit. I thought her<br/>shallow. Suddenly something happened that made me afraid. I can't<br/>tell you what it was, but it was terrible. I said I would go back<br/>to her. I felt I had done wrong. And now she is dead. My God! My<br/>God! Harry, what shall I do? You don't know the danger I am in, and<br/>there is nothing to keep me straight. She would have done that for<br/>me. She had no right to kill herself. It was selfish of her."<br/><br/>"My dear Dorian," answered Lord Henry, taking a cigarette from<br/>his case and producing a gold-latten matchbox, "the only way a<br/>woman can ever reform a man is by boring him so completely that he<br/>loses all possible interest in life. If you had married this girl,<br/>you would have been wretched. Of course, you would have treated her<br/>kindly. One can always be kind to people about whom one cares<br/>nothing. But she would have soon found out that you were absolutely<br/>indifferent to her. And when a woman finds that out about her<br/>husband, she either becomes dreadfully dowdy, or wears very smart<br/>bonnets that some other woman's husband has to pay for. I say<br/>nothing about the social mistake, which would have been<br/>abject—which, of course, I would not have allowed— but I assure you<br/>that in any case the whole thing would have been an absolute<br/>failure."<br/><br/>"I suppose it would," muttered the lad, walking up and down the<br/>room and looking horribly pale. "But I thought it was my duty. It<br/>is not my fault that this terrible tragedy has prevented my doing<br/>what was right. I remember your saying once that there is a<br/>fatality about good resolutions—that they are always made too late.<br/>Mine certainly were."<br/><br/>"Good resolutions are useless attempts to interfere with<br/>scientific laws. Their origin is pure vanity. Their result is<br/>absolutely nil. They give us, now and then, some of those luxurious<br/>sterile emotions that have a certain charm for the weak. That is<br/>all that can be said for them. They are simply cheques that men<br/>draw on a bank where they have no account."<br/><br/>"Harry," cried Dorian Gray, coming over and sitting down beside<br/>him, "why is it that I cannot feel this tragedy as much as I want<br/>to? I don't think I am heartless. Do you?"<br/><br/>
