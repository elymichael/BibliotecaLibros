"What has happened?" he asked. "Oh! I remember. Am I safe here,
Harry?" He began to tremble.

"My dear Dorian," answered Lord Henry, "you merely fainted. That
was all. You must have overtired yourself. You had better not come
down to dinner. I will take your place."

"No, I will come down," he said, struggling to his feet. "I
would rather come down. I must not be alone."

He went to his room and dressed. There was a wild recklessness
of gaiety in his manner as he sat at table, but now and then a
thrill of terror ran through him when he remembered that, pressed
against the window of the conservatory, like a white handkerchief,
he had seen the face of James Vane watching him.
