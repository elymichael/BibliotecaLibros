"They say that when good Americans die they go to Paris,"<br/>chuckled Sir Thomas, who had a large wardrobe of Humour's cast-off<br/>clothes.<br/><br/>"Really! And where do bad Americans go to when they die?"<br/>inquired the duchess.<br/><br/>"They go to America," murmured Lord Henry.<br/><br/>Sir Thomas frowned. "I am afraid that your nephew is prejudiced<br/>against that great country," he said to Lady Agatha. "I have<br/>travelled all over it in cars provided by the directors, who, in<br/>such matters, are extremely civil. I assure you that it is an<br/>education to visit it."<br/><br/>"But must we really see Chicago in order to be educated?" asked<br/>Mr. Erskine plaintively. "I don't feel up to the journey."<br/><br/>Sir Thomas waved his hand. "Mr. Erskine of Treadley has the<br/>world on his shelves. We practical men like to see things, not to<br/>read about them. The Americans are an extremely interesting people.<br/>They are absolutely reasonable. I think that is their<br/>distinguishing characteristic. Yes, Mr. Erskine, an absolutely<br/>reasonable people. I assure you there is no nonsense about the<br/>Americans."<br/><br/>"How dreadful!" cried Lord Henry. "I can stand brute force, but<br/>brute reason is quite unbearable. There is something unfair about<br/>its use. It is hitting below the intellect."<br/><br/>"I do not understand you," said Sir Thomas, growing rather<br/>red.<br/><br/>"I do, Lord Henry," murmured Mr. Erskine, with a smile.<br/><br/>"Paradoxes are all very well in their wayâ€¦ ." rejoined the<br/>baronet.<br/><br/>"Was that a paradox?" asked Mr. Erskine. "I did not think so.<br/>Perhaps it was. Well, the way of paradoxes is the way of truth. To<br/>test reality we must see it on the tight rope. When the verities<br/>become acrobats, we can judge them."<br/>
