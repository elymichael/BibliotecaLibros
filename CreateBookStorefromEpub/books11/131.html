"You are mad. What have I done to you?"<br/><br/>"You wrecked the life of Sibyl Vane," was the answer, "and Sibyl<br/>Vane was my sister. She killed herself. I know it. Her death is at<br/>your door. I swore I would kill you in return. For years I have<br/>sought you. I had no clue, no trace. The two people who could have<br/>described you were dead. I knew nothing of you but the pet name she<br/>used to call you. I heard it to-night by chance. Make your peace<br/>with God, for to-night you are going to die."<br/><br/>Dorian Gray grew sick with fear. "I never knew her," he<br/>stammered. "I never heard of her. You are mad."<br/><br/>"You had better confess your sin, for as sure as I am James<br/>Vane, you are going to die." There was a horrible moment. Dorian<br/>did not know what to say or do. "Down on your knees!" growled the<br/>man. "I give you one minute to make your peaceâ€”no more. I go on<br/>board to-night for India, and I must do my job first. One minute.<br/>That's all."<br/><br/>Dorian's arms fell to his side. Paralysed with terror, he did<br/>not know what to do. Suddenly a wild hope flashed across his brain.<br/>"Stop," he cried. "How long ago is it since your sister died?<br/>Quick, tell me!"<br/><br/>"Eighteen years," said the man. "Why do you ask me? What do<br/>years matter?"<br/><br/>"Eighteen years," laughed Dorian Gray, with a touch of triumph<br/>in his voice. "Eighteen years! Set me under the lamp and look at my<br/>face!"<br/><br/>James Vane hesitated for a moment, not understanding what was<br/>meant. Then he seized Dorian Gray and dragged him from the<br/>archway.<br/><br/>Dim and wavering as was the wind-blown light, yet it served to<br/>show him the hideous error, as it seemed, into which he had fallen,<br/>for the face of the man he had sought to kill had all the bloom of<br/>boyhood, all the unstained purity of youth. He seemed little more<br/>than a lad of twenty summers, hardly older, if older indeed at all,<br/>than his sister had been when they had parted so many years ago. It<br/>was obvious that this was not the man who had destroyed her<br/>life.<br/><br/>He loosened his hold and reeled back. "My God! my God!" he<br/>cried, "and I would have murdered you!"<br/><br/>Dorian Gray drew a long breath. "You have been on the brink of<br/>committing a terrible crime, my man," he said, looking at him<br/>sternly. "Let this be a warning to you not to take vengeance into<br/>your own hands."<br/>
