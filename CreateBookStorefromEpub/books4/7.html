It was quite true; the leaves had been found very near the<br/>window.<br/><br/>Mrs. Darling did not know what to think, for it all seemed so<br/>natural to Wendy that you could not dismiss it by saying she had<br/>been dreaming.<br/><br/>"My child," the mother cried, "why did you not tell me of this<br/>before?"<br/><br/>"I forgot," said Wendy lightly. She was in a hurry to get her<br/>breakfast.<br/><br/>Oh, surely she must have been dreaming.<br/><br/>But, on the other hand, there were the leaves. Mrs. Darling<br/>examined them very carefully; they were skeleton leaves, but she<br/>was sure they did not come from any tree that grew in England. She<br/>crawled about the floor, peering at it with a candle for marks of a<br/>strange foot. She rattled the poker up the chimney and tapped the<br/>walls. She let down a tape from the window to the pavement, and it<br/>was a sheer drop of thirty feet, without so much as a spout to<br/>climb up by.<br/><br/>Certainly Wendy had been dreaming.<br/><br/>But Wendy had not been dreaming, as the very next night showed,<br/>the night on which the extraordinary adventures of these children<br/>may be said to have begun.<br/><br/>On the night we speak of all the children were once more in bed.<br/>It happened to be Nana's evening off, and Mrs. Darling had bathed<br/>them and sung to them till one by one they had let go her hand and<br/>slid away into the land of sleep.<br/><br/>All were looking so safe and cosy that she smiled at her fears<br/>now and sat down tranquilly by the fire to sew.<br/><br/>It was something for Michael, who on his birthday was getting<br/>into shirts. The fire was warm, however, and the nursery dimly lit<br/>by three night-lights, and presently the sewing lay on Mrs.<br/>Darling's lap. Then her head nodded, oh, so gracefully. She was<br/>asleep. Look at the four of them, Wendy and Michael over there,<br/>John here, and Mrs. Darling by the fire. There should have been a<br/>fourth night-light.<br/>
