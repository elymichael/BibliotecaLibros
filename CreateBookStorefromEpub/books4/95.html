<br/>It was the tail of a kite, which Michael had made some days<br/>before. It had torn itself out of his hand and floated away.<br/><br/>"Michael's kite," Peter said without interest, but next moment<br/>he had seized the tail, and was pulling the kite toward him.<br/><br/>"It lifted Michael off the ground," he cried; "why should it not<br/>carry you?"<br/><br/>"Both of us!"<br/><br/>"It can't lift two; Michael and Curly tried."<br/><br/>"Let us draw lots," Wendy said bravely.<br/><br/>"And you a lady; never." Already he had tied the tail round her.<br/>She clung to him; she refused to go without him; but with a<br/>"Good-bye, Wendy," he pushed her from the rock; and in a few<br/>minutes she was borne out of his sight. Peter was alone on the<br/>lagoon.<br/><br/>The rock was very small now; soon it would be submerged. Pale<br/>rays of light tiptoed across the waters; and by and by there was to<br/>be heard a sound at once the most musical and the most melancholy<br/>in the world: the mermaids calling to the moon.<br/><br/>Peter was not quite like other boys; but he was afraid at last.<br/>A tremour ran through him, like a shudder passing over the sea; but<br/>on the sea one shudder follows another till there are hundreds of<br/>them, and Peter felt just the one. Next moment he was standing<br/>erect on the rock again, with that smile on his face and a drum<br/>beating within him. It was saying, "To die will be an awfully big<br/>adventure."<br/><br/><br/><br/>
