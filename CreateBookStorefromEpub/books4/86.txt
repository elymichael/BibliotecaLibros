"Captain," said Smee, "could we not kidnap these boys' mother
and make her our mother?"

"It is a princely scheme," cried Hook, and at once it took
practical shape in his great brain. "We will seize the children and
carry them to the boat: the boys we will make walk the plank, and
Wendy shall be our mother."

Again Wendy forgot herself.

"Never!" she cried, and bobbed.

"What was that?"

But they could see nothing. They thought it must have been a
leaf in the wind. "Do you agree, my bullies?" asked Hook.

"There is my hand on it," they both said.

"And there is my hook. Swear."

They all swore. By this time they were on the rock, and suddenly
Hook remembered Tiger Lily.

"Where is the redskin?" he demanded abruptly.

He had a playful humour at moments, and they thought this was
one of the moments.
