To what extent Hook is to blame for his tactics on this occasion
is for the historian to decide. Had he waited on the rising ground
till the proper hour he and his men would probably have been
butchered; and in judging him it is only fair to take this into
account. What he should perhaps have done was to acquaint his
opponents that he proposed to follow a new method. On the other
hand, this, as destroying the element of surprise, would have made
his strategy of no avail, so that the whole question is beset with
difficulties. One cannot at least withhold a reluctant admiration
for the wit that had conceived so bold a scheme, and the fell
[deadly] genius with which it was carried out.

What were his own feelings about himself at that triumphant
moment? Fain [gladly] would his dogs have known, as breathing
heavily and wiping their cutlasses, they gathered at a discreet
distance from his hook, and squinted through their ferret eyes at
this extraordinary man. Elation must have been in his heart, but
his face did not reflect it: ever a dark and solitary enigma, he
stood aloof from his followers in spirit as in substance.

The night's work was not yet over, for it was not the redskins
he had come out to destroy; they were but the bees to be smoked, so
that he should get at the honey. It was Pan he wanted, Pan and
Wendy and their band, but chiefly Pan.

Peter was such a small boy that one tends to wonder at the man's
hatred of him. True he had flung Hook's arm to the crocodile, but
even this and the increased insecurity of life to which it led,
owing to the crocodile's pertinacity [persistance], hardly account
for a vindictiveness so relentless and malignant. The truth is that
there was a something about Peter which goaded the pirate captain
to frenzy. It was not his courage, it was not his engaging
appearance, it was notâ€”. There is no beating about the bush, for we
know quite well what it was, and have got to tell. It was Peter's
cockiness.

This had got on Hook's nerves; it made his iron claw twitch, and
at night it disturbed him like an insect. While Peter lived, the
tortured man felt that he was a lion in a cage into which a sparrow
had come.

The question now was how to get down the trees, or how to get
his dogs down? He ran his greedy eyes over them, searching for the
thinnest ones. They wriggled uncomfortably, for they knew he would
not scruple [hesitate] to ram them down with poles.

In the meantime, what of the boys? We have seen them at the
first clang of the weapons, turned as it were into stone figures,
open-mouthed, all appealing with outstretched arms to Peter; and we
return to them as their mouths close, and their arms fall to their
sides. The pandemonium above has ceased almost as suddenly as it
arose, passed like a fierce gust of wind; but they know that in the
passing it has determined their fate.

Which side had won?

The pirates, listening avidly at the mouths of the trees, heard
the question put by every boy, and alas, they also heard Peter's
answer.

"If the redskins have won," he said, "they will beat the
tom-tom; it is always their sign of victory."
