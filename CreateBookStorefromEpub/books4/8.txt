While she slept she had a dream. She dreamt that the Neverland
had come too near and that a strange boy had broken through from
it. He did not alarm her, for she thought she had seen him before
in the faces of many women who have no children. Perhaps he is to
be found in the faces of some mothers also. But in her dream he had
rent the film that obscures the Neverland, and she saw Wendy and
John and Michael peeping through the gap.

The dream by itself would have been a trifle, but while she was
dreaming the window of the nursery blew open, and a boy did drop on
the floor. He was accompanied by a strange light, no bigger than
your fist, which darted about the room like a living thing and I
think it must have been this light that wakened Mrs. Darling.

She started up with a cry, and saw the boy, and somehow she knew
at once that he was Peter Pan. If you or I or Wendy had been there
we should have seen that he was very like Mrs. Darling's kiss. He
was a lovely boy, clad in skeleton leaves and the juices that ooze
out of trees but the most entrancing thing about him was that he
had all his first teeth. When he saw she was a grown-up, he gnashed
the little pearls at her.
