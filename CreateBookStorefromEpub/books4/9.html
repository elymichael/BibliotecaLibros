<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>2<br/>THE SHADOW<br/><br/><br/>Mrs. Darling screamed, and, as if in answer to a bell, the door<br/>opened, and Nana entered, returned from her evening out. She<br/>growled and sprang at the boy, who leapt lightly through the<br/>window. Again Mrs. Darling screamed, this time in distress for him,<br/>for she thought he was killed, and she ran down into the street to<br/>look for his little body, but it was not there; and she looked up,<br/>and in the black night she could see nothing but what she thought<br/>was a shooting star.<br/><br/>She returned to the nursery, and found Nana with something in<br/>her mouth, which proved to be the boy's shadow. As he leapt at the<br/>window Nana had closed it quickly, too late to catch him, but his<br/>shadow had not had time to get out; slam went the window and<br/>snapped it off.<br/><br/>You may be sure Mrs. Darling examined the shadow carefully, but<br/>it was quite the ordinary kind.<br/><br/>Nana had no doubt of what was the best thing to do with this<br/>shadow. She hung it out at the window, meaning "He is sure to come<br/>back for it; let us put it where he can get it easily without<br/>disturbing the children."<br/><br/>But unfortunately Mrs. Darling could not leave it hanging out at<br/>the window, it looked so like the washing and lowered the whole<br/>tone of the house. She thought of showing it to Mr. Darling, but he<br/>was totting up winter great-coats for John and Michael, with a wet<br/>towel around his head to keep his brain clear, and it seemed a<br/>shame to trouble him; besides, she knew exactly what he would say:<br/>"It all comes of having a dog for a nurse."<br/><br/>She decided to roll the shadow up and put it away carefully in a<br/>drawer, until a fitting opportunity came for telling her husband.<br/>Ah me!<br/><br/>The opportunity came a week later, on that never-to-be-forgotten<br/>Friday. Of course it was a Friday.<br/>
