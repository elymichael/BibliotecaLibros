Hook stood shuddering, one foot in the air.

"The crocodile!" he gasped, and bounded away, followed by his
bo'sun.

It was indeed the crocodile. It had passed the redskins, who
were now on the trail of the other pirates. It oozed on after
Hook.

Once more the boys emerged into the open; but the dangers of the
night were not yet over, for presently Nibs rushed breathless into
their midst, pursued by a pack of wolves. The tongues of the
pursuers were hanging out; the baying of them was horrible.

"Save me, save me!" cried Nibs, falling on the ground.

"But what can we do, what can we do?"

It was a high compliment to Peter that at that dire moment their
thoughts turned to him.

"What would Peter do?" they cried simultaneously.

Almost in the same breath they cried, "Peter would look at them
through his legs."

And then, "Let us do what Peter would do."

It is quite the most successful way of defying wolves, and as
one boy they bent and looked through their legs. The next moment is
the long one, but victory came quickly, for as the boys advanced
upon them in the terrible attitude, the wolves dropped their tails
and fled.
