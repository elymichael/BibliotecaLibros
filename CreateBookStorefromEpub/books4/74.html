They were very ashamed, but Tootles gave the sole of his shoe,<br/>and it made an excellent knocker.<br/><br/>Absolutely finished now, they thought.<br/><br/>Not of bit of it. "There's no chimney," Peter said; "we must<br/>have a chimney."<br/><br/>"It certainly does need a chimney," said John importantly. This<br/>gave Peter an idea. He snatched the hat off John's head, knocked<br/>out the bottom [top], and put the hat on the roof. The little house<br/>was so pleased to have such a capital chimney that, as if to say<br/>thank you, smoke immediately began to come out of the hat.<br/><br/>Now really and truly it was finished. Nothing remained to do but<br/>to knock.<br/><br/>"All look your best," Peter warned them; "first impressions are<br/>awfully important."<br/><br/>He was glad no one asked him what first impressions are; they<br/>were all too busy looking their best.<br/><br/>He knocked politely, and now the wood was as still as the<br/>children, not a sound to be heard except from Tinker Bell, who was<br/>watching from a branch and openly sneering.<br/><br/>What the boys were wondering was, would any one answer the<br/>knock? If a lady, what would she be like?<br/><br/>The door opened and a lady came out. It was Wendy. They all<br/>whipped off their hats.<br/><br/>She looked properly surprised, and this was just how they had<br/>hoped she would look.<br/>
