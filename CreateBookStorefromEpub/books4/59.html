Hook stood shuddering, one foot in the air.<br/><br/>"The crocodile!" he gasped, and bounded away, followed by his<br/>bo'sun.<br/><br/>It was indeed the crocodile. It had passed the redskins, who<br/>were now on the trail of the other pirates. It oozed on after<br/>Hook.<br/><br/>Once more the boys emerged into the open; but the dangers of the<br/>night were not yet over, for presently Nibs rushed breathless into<br/>their midst, pursued by a pack of wolves. The tongues of the<br/>pursuers were hanging out; the baying of them was horrible.<br/><br/>"Save me, save me!" cried Nibs, falling on the ground.<br/><br/>"But what can we do, what can we do?"<br/><br/>It was a high compliment to Peter that at that dire moment their<br/>thoughts turned to him.<br/><br/>"What would Peter do?" they cried simultaneously.<br/><br/>Almost in the same breath they cried, "Peter would look at them<br/>through his legs."<br/><br/>And then, "Let us do what Peter would do."<br/><br/>It is quite the most successful way of defying wolves, and as<br/>one boy they bent and looked through their legs. The next moment is<br/>the long one, but victory came quickly, for as the boys advanced<br/>upon them in the terrible attitude, the wolves dropped their tails<br/>and fled.<br/>
