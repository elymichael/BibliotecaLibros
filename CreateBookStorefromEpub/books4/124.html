<br/>To what extent Hook is to blame for his tactics on this occasion<br/>is for the historian to decide. Had he waited on the rising ground<br/>till the proper hour he and his men would probably have been<br/>butchered; and in judging him it is only fair to take this into<br/>account. What he should perhaps have done was to acquaint his<br/>opponents that he proposed to follow a new method. On the other<br/>hand, this, as destroying the element of surprise, would have made<br/>his strategy of no avail, so that the whole question is beset with<br/>difficulties. One cannot at least withhold a reluctant admiration<br/>for the wit that had conceived so bold a scheme, and the fell<br/>[deadly] genius with which it was carried out.<br/><br/>What were his own feelings about himself at that triumphant<br/>moment? Fain [gladly] would his dogs have known, as breathing<br/>heavily and wiping their cutlasses, they gathered at a discreet<br/>distance from his hook, and squinted through their ferret eyes at<br/>this extraordinary man. Elation must have been in his heart, but<br/>his face did not reflect it: ever a dark and solitary enigma, he<br/>stood aloof from his followers in spirit as in substance.<br/><br/>The night's work was not yet over, for it was not the redskins<br/>he had come out to destroy; they were but the bees to be smoked, so<br/>that he should get at the honey. It was Pan he wanted, Pan and<br/>Wendy and their band, but chiefly Pan.<br/><br/>Peter was such a small boy that one tends to wonder at the man's<br/>hatred of him. True he had flung Hook's arm to the crocodile, but<br/>even this and the increased insecurity of life to which it led,<br/>owing to the crocodile's pertinacity [persistance], hardly account<br/>for a vindictiveness so relentless and malignant. The truth is that<br/>there was a something about Peter which goaded the pirate captain<br/>to frenzy. It was not his courage, it was not his engaging<br/>appearance, it was notâ€”. There is no beating about the bush, for we<br/>know quite well what it was, and have got to tell. It was Peter's<br/>cockiness.<br/><br/>This had got on Hook's nerves; it made his iron claw twitch, and<br/>at night it disturbed him like an insect. While Peter lived, the<br/>tortured man felt that he was a lion in a cage into which a sparrow<br/>had come.<br/><br/>The question now was how to get down the trees, or how to get<br/>his dogs down? He ran his greedy eyes over them, searching for the<br/>thinnest ones. They wriggled uncomfortably, for they knew he would<br/>not scruple [hesitate] to ram them down with poles.<br/><br/>In the meantime, what of the boys? We have seen them at the<br/>first clang of the weapons, turned as it were into stone figures,<br/>open-mouthed, all appealing with outstretched arms to Peter; and we<br/>return to them as their mouths close, and their arms fall to their<br/>sides. The pandemonium above has ceased almost as suddenly as it<br/>arose, passed like a fierce gust of wind; but they know that in the<br/>passing it has determined their fate.<br/><br/>Which side had won?<br/><br/>The pirates, listening avidly at the mouths of the trees, heard<br/>the question put by every boy, and alas, they also heard Peter's<br/>answer.<br/><br/>"If the redskins have won," he said, "they will beat the<br/>tom-tom; it is always their sign of victory."<br/><br/>
