"But not really, Wendy?" he asked anxiously.

"Not if you don't wish it," she replied; and she distinctly
heard his sigh of relief. "Peter," she asked, trying to speak
firmly, "what are your exact feelings to [about] me?"

"Those of a devoted son, Wendy."

"I thought so," she said, and went and sat by herself at the
extreme end of the room.

"You are so queer," he said, frankly puzzled, "and Tiger Lily is
just the same. There is something she wants to be to me, but she
says it is not my mother."

"No, indeed, it is not," Wendy replied with frightful emphasis.
Now we know why she was prejudiced against the redskins.

"Then what is it?"

"It isn't for a lady to tell."

"Oh, very well," Peter said, a little nettled. "Perhaps Tinker
Bell will tell me."

"Oh yes, Tinker Bell will tell you," Wendy retorted scornfully.
"She is an abandoned little creature."

Here Tink, who was in her bedroom, eavesdropping, squeaked out
something impudent.
