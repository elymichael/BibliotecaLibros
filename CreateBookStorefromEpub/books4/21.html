<br/>If he thought at all, but I don't believe he ever thought, it<br/>was that he and his shadow, when brought near each other, would<br/>join like drops of water, and when they did not he was appalled. He<br/>tried to stick it on with soap from the bathroom, but that also<br/>failed. A shudder passed through Peter, and he sat on the floor and<br/>cried.<br/><br/>His sobs woke Wendy, and she sat up in bed. She was not alarmed<br/>to see a stranger crying on the nursery floor; she was only<br/>pleasantly interested.<br/><br/>"Boy," she said courteously, "why are you crying?"<br/><br/>Peter could be exceeding polite also, having learned the grand<br/>manner at fairy ceremonies, and he rose and bowed to her<br/>beautifully. She was much pleased, and bowed beautifully to him<br/>from the bed.<br/><br/>"What's your name?" he asked.<br/><br/>"Wendy Moira Angela Darling," she replied with some<br/>satisfaction. "What is your name?"<br/><br/>"Peter Pan."<br/><br/>She was already sure that he must be Peter, but it did seem a<br/>comparatively short name.<br/><br/>"Is that all?"<br/><br/>"Yes," he said rather sharply. He felt for the first time that<br/>it was a shortish name.<br/><br/>
