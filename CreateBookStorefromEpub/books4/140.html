At this moment Wendy was grand. "These are my last words, dear<br/>boys," she said firmly. "I feel that I have a message to you from<br/>your real mothers, and it is this: 'We hope our sons will die like<br/>English gentlemen.'"<br/><br/>Even the pirates were awed, and Tootles cried out hysterically,<br/>"I am going to do what my mother hopes. What are you to do,<br/>Nibs?"<br/><br/>"What my mother hopes. What are you to do, Twin?"<br/><br/>"What my mother hopes. John, what areâ€”"<br/><br/>But Hook had found his voice again.<br/><br/>"Tie her up!" he shouted.<br/><br/>It was Smee who tied her to the mast. "See here, honey," he<br/>whispered, "I'll save you if you promise to be my mother."<br/><br/>But not even for Smee would she make such a promise. "I would<br/>almost rather have no children at all," she said disdainfully<br/>[scornfully].<br/><br/>It is sad to know that not a boy was looking at her as Smee tied<br/>her to the mast; the eyes of all were on the plank: that last<br/>little walk they were about to take. They were no longer able to<br/>hope that they would walk it manfully, for the capacity to think<br/>had gone from them; they could stare and shiver only.<br/><br/>Hook smiled on them with his teeth closed, and took a step<br/>toward Wendy. His intention was to turn her face so that she should<br/>see they boys walking the plank one by one. But he never reached<br/>her, he never heard the cry of anguish he hoped to wring from her.<br/>He heard something else instead.<br/><br/>It was the terrible tick-tick of the crocodile.<br/>
