<br/>"Full of remorse as ever, dearest! See my punishment: living in<br/>a kennel."<br/><br/>"But it is punishment, isn't it, George? You are sure you are<br/>not enjoying it?"<br/><br/>"My love!"<br/><br/>You may be sure she begged his pardon; and then, feeling drowsy,<br/>he curled round in the kennel.<br/><br/>"Won't you play me to sleep," he asked, "on the nursery piano?"<br/>and as she was crossing to the day-nursery he added thoughtlessly,<br/>"And shut that window. I feel a draught."<br/><br/>"O George, never ask me to do that. The window must always be<br/>left open for them, always, always."<br/><br/>Now it was his turn to beg her pardon; and she went into the<br/>day-nursery and played, and soon he was asleep; and while he slept,<br/>Wendy and John and Michael flew into the room.<br/><br/>Oh no. We have written it so, because that was the charming<br/>arrangement planned by them before we left the ship; but something<br/>must have happened since then, for it is not they who have flown<br/>in, it is Peter and Tinker Bell.<br/><br/>Peter's first words tell all.<br/><br/>"Quick Tink," he whispered, "close the window; bar it! That's<br/>right. Now you and I must get away by the door; and when Wendy<br/>comes she will think her mother has barred her out; and she will<br/>have to go back with me."<br/><br/>
