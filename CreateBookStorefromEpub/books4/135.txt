Good form! However much he may have degenerated, he still knew
that this is all that really matters.

From far within him he heard a creaking as of rusty portals, and
through them came a stern tap-tap-tap, like hammering in the night
when one cannot sleep. "Have you been good form to-day?" was their
eternal question.

"Fame, fame, that glittering bauble, it is mine," he cried.

"Is it quite good form to be distinguished at anything?" the
tap-tap from his school replied.

"I am the only man whom Barbecue feared," he urged, "and Flint
feared Barbecue."

"Barbecue, Flintâ€”what house?" came the cutting retort.

Most disquieting reflection of all, was it not bad form to think
about good form?

His vitals were tortured by this problem. It was a claw within
him sharper than the iron one; and as it tore him, the perspiration
dripped down his tallow [waxy] countenance and streaked his
doublet. Ofttimes he drew his sleeve across his face, but there was
no damming that trickle.

Ah, envy not Hook.

There came to him a presentiment of his early dissolution
[death]. It was as if Peter's terrible oath had boarded the ship.
Hook felt a gloomy desire to make his dying speech, lest presently
there should be no time for it.
