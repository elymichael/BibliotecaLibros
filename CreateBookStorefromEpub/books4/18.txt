"George, George," Mrs. Darling whispered, "remember what I told
you about that boy."

Alas, he would not listen. He was determined to show who was
master in that house, and when commands would not draw Nana from
the kennel, he lured her out of it with honeyed words, and seizing
her roughly, dragged her from the nursery. He was ashamed of
himself, and yet he did it. It was all owing to his too
affectionate nature, which craved for admiration. When he had tied
her up in the back-yard, the wretched father went and sat in the
passage, with his knuckles to his eyes.

In the meantime Mrs. Darling had put the children to bed in
unwonted silence and lit their night-lights. They could hear Nana
barking, and John whimpered, "It is because he is chaining her up
in the yard," but Wendy was wiser.

"That is not Nana's unhappy bark," she said, little guessing
what was about to happen; "that is her bark when she smells
danger."

Danger!

"Are you sure, Wendy?"

"Oh, yes."

Mrs. Darling quivered and went to the window. It was securely
fastened. She looked out, and the night was peppered with stars.
They were crowding round the house, as if curious to see what was
to take place there, but she did not notice this, nor that one or
two of the smaller ones winked at her. Yet a nameless fear clutched
at her heart and made her cry, "Oh, how I wish that I wasn't going
to a party to-night!"

Even Michael, already half asleep, knew that she was perturbed,
and he asked, "Can anything harm us, mother, after the night-lights
are lit?"

"Nothing, precious," she said; "they are the eyes a mother
leaves behind her to guard her children."
