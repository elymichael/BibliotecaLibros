"That must have been Tink. I never knew her so naughty
before."

And indeed Tink was darting about again, using offensive
language.

"She says she will do that to you, Wendy, every time I give you
a thimble."

"But why?"

"Why, Tink?"

Again Tink replied, "You silly ass." Peter could not understand
why, but Wendy understood, and she was just slightly disappointed
when he admitted that he came to the nursery window not to see her
but to listen to stories.

"You see, I don't know any stories. None of the lost boys knows
any stories."

"How perfectly awful," Wendy said.

"Do you know," Peter asked "why swallows build in the eaves of
houses? It is to listen to the stories. O Wendy, your mother was
telling you such a lovely story."

"Which story was it?"

"About the prince who couldn't find the lady who wore the glass
slipper."
