In a moment they were as busy as tailors the night before a
wedding. They skurried this way and that, down for bedding, up for
firewood, and while they were at it, who should appear but John and
Michael. As they dragged along the ground they fell asleep
standing, stopped, woke up, moved another step and slept again.

"John, John," Michael would cry, "wake up! Where is Nana, John,
and mother?"

And then John would rub his eyes and mutter, "It is true, we did
fly."

You may be sure they were very relieved to find Peter.

"Hullo, Peter," they said.

"Hullo," replied Peter amicably, though he had quite forgotten
them. He was very busy at the moment measuring Wendy with his feet
to see how large a house she would need. Of course he meant to
leave room for chairs and a table. John and Michael watched
him.

"Is Wendy asleep?" they asked.

"Yes."

"John," Michael proposed, "let us wake her and get her to make
supper for us," but as he said it some of the other boys rushed on
carrying branches for the building of the house. "Look at them!" he
cried.

"Curly," said Peter in his most captainy voice, "see that these
boys help in the building of the house."

"Ay, ay, sir."
