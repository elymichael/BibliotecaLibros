In a tremble they opened the street door. Mr. Darling would have
rushed upstairs, but Mrs. Darling signed him to go softly. She even
tried to make her heart go softly.

Will they reach the nursery in time? If so, how delightful for
them, and we shall all breathe a sigh of relief, but there will be
no story. On the other hand, if they are not in time, I solemnly
promise that it will all come right in the end.

They would have reached the nursery in time had it not been that
the little stars were watching them. Once again the stars blew the
window open, and that smallest star of all called out:

"Cave, Peter!"

Then Peter knew that there was not a moment to lose. "Come," he
cried imperiously, and soared out at once into the night, followed
by John and Michael and Wendy.

Mr. and Mrs. Darling and Nana rushed into the nursery too late.
The birds were flown.
