<br/>"I—want—you—" the bird said, and repeated it all over.<br/><br/>Then Peter tried slow and distinct.<br/><br/>"What—are—you—quacking—about?" and so on.<br/><br/>The Never bird became irritated; they have very short<br/>tempers.<br/><br/>"You dunderheaded little jay," she screamed, "Why don't you do<br/>as I tell you?"<br/><br/>Peter felt that she was calling him names, and at a venture he<br/>retorted hotly:<br/><br/>"So are you!"<br/><br/>Then rather curiously they both snapped out the same remark:<br/><br/>"Shut up!"<br/><br/>"Shut up!"<br/><br/>
