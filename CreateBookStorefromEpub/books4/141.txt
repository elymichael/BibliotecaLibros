They all heard itâ€”pirates, boys, Wendy; and immediately every
head was blown in one direction; not to the water whence the sound
proceeded, but toward Hook. All knew that what was about to happen
concerned him alone, and that from being actors they were suddenly
become spectators.

Very frightful was it to see the change that came over him. It
was as if he had been clipped at every joint. He fell in a little
heap.

The sound came steadily nearer; and in advance of it came this
ghastly thought, "The crocodile is about to board the ship!"

Even the iron claw hung inactive; as if knowing that it was no
intrinsic part of what the attacking force wanted. Left so
fearfully alone, any other man would have lain with his eyes shut
where he fell: but the gigantic brain of Hook was still working,
and under its guidance he crawled on the knees along the deck as
far from the sound as he could go. The pirates respectfully cleared
a passage for him, and it was only when he brought up against the
bulwarks that he spoke.

"Hide me!" he cried hoarsely.

They gathered round him, all eyes averted from the thing that
was coming aboard. They had no thought of fighting it. It was
Fate.

Only when Hook was hidden from them did curiosity loosen the
limbs of the boys so that they could rush to the ship's side to see
the crocodile climbing it. Then they got the strangest surprise of
the Night of Nights; for it was no crocodile that was coming to
their aid. It was Peter.

He signed to them not to give vent to any cry of admiration that
might rouse suspicion. Then he went on ticking.
