"Did you hear them say Peter Pan's from home?" Smee whispered,
fidgeting with Johnny Corkscrew.

Hook nodded. He stood for a long time lost in thought, and at
last a curdling smile lit up his swarthy face. Smee had been
waiting for it. "Unrip your plan, captain," he cried eagerly.

"To return to the ship," Hook replied slowly through his teeth,
"and cook a large rich cake of a jolly thickness with green sugar
on it. There can be but one room below, for there is but one
chimney. The silly moles had not the sense to see that they did not
need a door apiece. That shows they have no mother. We will leave
the cake on the shore of the Mermaids' Lagoon. These boys are
always swimming about there, playing with the mermaids. They will
find the cake and they will gobble it up, because, having no
mother, they don't know how dangerous 'tis to eat rich damp cake."
He burst into laughter, not hollow laughter now, but honest
laughter. "Aha, they will die."

Smee had listened with growing admiration.

"It's the wickedest, prettiest policy ever I heard of!" he
cried, and in their exultation they danced and sang:


"Avast, belay, when I appear,
By fear they're overtook;
Nought's left upon your bones when you
Have shaken claws with Hook."


They began the verse, but they never finished it, for another
sound broke in and stilled them. There was at first such a tiny
sound that a leaf might have fallen on it and smothered it, but as
it came nearer it was more distinct.

Tick tick tick tick!
