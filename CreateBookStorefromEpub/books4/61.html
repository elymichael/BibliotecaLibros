He had a bow and arrow<br/>with him, and Tink noted it, and rubbed her little hands.<br/><br/>"Quick, Tootles, quick," she screamed. "Peter will be so<br/>pleased."<br/><br/>Tootles excitedly fitted the arrow to his bow. "Out of the way,<br/>Tink," he shouted, and then he fired, and Wendy fluttered to the<br/>ground with an arrow in her breast.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
