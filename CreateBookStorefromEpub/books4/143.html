<br/>None too soon, Peter, every inch of him on tiptoe, vanished into<br/>the cabin; for more than one pirate was screwing up his courage to<br/>look round. They could hear each other's distressed breathing now,<br/>which showed them that the more terrible sound had passed.<br/><br/>"It's gone, captain," Smee said, wiping off his spectacles.<br/>"All's still again."<br/><br/>Slowly Hook let his head emerge from his ruff, and listened so<br/>intently that he could have caught the echo of the tick. There was<br/>not a sound, and he drew himself up firmly to his full height.<br/><br/>"Then here's to Johnny Plank!" he cried brazenly, hating the<br/>boys more than ever because they had seen him unbend. He broke into<br/>the villainous ditty:<br/><br/><br/>"Yo ho, yo ho, the frisky plank,<br/>You walks along it so,<br/>Till it goes down and you goes down<br/>To Davy Jones below!"<br/><br/><br/>To terrorize the prisoners the more, though with a certain loss<br/>of dignity, he danced along an imaginary plank, grimacing at them<br/>as he sang; and when he finished he cried, "Do you want a touch of<br/>the cat [o' nine tails] before you walk the plank?"<br/><br/>At that they fell on their knees. "No, no!" they cried so<br/>piteously that every pirate smiled.<br/><br/>"Fetch the cat, Jukes," said Hook; "it's in the cabin."<br/>
