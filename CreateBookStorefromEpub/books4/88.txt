"Who are you, stranger? Speak!" Hook demanded.

"I am James Hook," replied the voice, "captain of the JOLLY
ROGER."

"You are not; you are not," Hook cried hoarsely.

"Brimstone and gall," the voice retorted, "say that again, and
I'll cast anchor in you."

Hook tried a more ingratiating manner. "If you are Hook," he
said almost humbly, "come tell me, who am I?"

"A codfish," replied the voice, "only a codfish."

"A codfish!" Hook echoed blankly, and it was then, but not till
then, that his proud spirit broke. He saw his men draw back from
him.

"Have we been captained all this time by a codfish!" they
muttered. "It is lowering to our pride."

They were his dogs snapping at him, but, tragic figure though he
had become, he scarcely heeded them. Against such fearful evidence
it was not their belief in him that he needed, it was his own. He
felt his ego slipping from him. "Don't desert me, bully," he
whispered hoarsely to it.

In his dark nature there was a touch of the feminine, as in all
the great pirates, and it sometimes gave him intuitions. Suddenly
he tried the guessing game.

"Hook," he called, "have you another voice?"
