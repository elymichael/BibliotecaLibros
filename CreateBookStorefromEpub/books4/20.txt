COME AWAY, COME AWAY!


For a moment after Mr. and Mrs. Darling left the house the
night-lights by the beds of the three children continued to burn
clearly. They were awfully nice little night-lights, and one cannot
help wishing that they could have kept awake to see Peter; but
Wendy's light blinked and gave such a yawn that the other two
yawned also, and before they could close their mouths all the three
went out.

There was another light in the room now, a thousand times
brighter than the night-lights, and in the time we have taken to
say this, it had been in all the drawers in the nursery, looking
for Peter's shadow, rummaged the wardrobe and turned every pocket
inside out. It was not really a light; it made this light by
flashing about so quickly, but when it came to rest for a second
you saw it was a fairy, no longer than your hand, but still
growing. It was a girl called Tinker Bell exquisitely gowned in a
skeleton leaf, cut low and square, through which her figure could
be seen to the best advantage. She was slightly inclined to
EMBONPOINT. [plump hourglass figure]

A moment after the fairy's entrance the window was blown open by
the breathing of the little stars, and Peter dropped in. He had
carried Tinker Bell part of the way, and his hand was still messy
with the fairy dust.

"Tinker Bell," he called softly, after making sure that the
children were asleep, "Tink, where are you?" She was in a jug for
the moment, and liking it extremely; she had never been in a jug
before.

"Oh, do come out of that jug, and tell me, do you know where
they put my shadow?"

The loveliest tinkle as of golden bells answered him. It is the
fairy language. You ordinary children can never hear it, but if you
were to hear it you would know that you had heard it once
before.

Tink said that the shadow was in the big box. She meant the
chest of drawers, and Peter jumped at the drawers, scattering their
contents to the floor with both hands, as kings toss ha'pence to
the crowd. In a moment he had recovered his shadow, and in his
delight he forgot that he had shut Tinker Bell up in the
drawer.
