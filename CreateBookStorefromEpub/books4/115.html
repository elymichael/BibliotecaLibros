<br/>"And who are the two noble portly figures accompanying her, now<br/>grown to man's estate? Can they be John and Michael? They are!"<br/><br/>"Oh!"<br/><br/>"'See, dear brothers,' says Wendy pointing upwards, 'there is<br/>the window still standing open. Ah, now we are rewarded for our<br/>sublime faith in a mother's love.' So up they flew to their mummy<br/>and daddy, and pen cannot describe the happy scene, over which we<br/>draw a veil."<br/><br/>That was the story, and they were as pleased with it as the fair<br/>narrator herself. Everything just as it should be, you see. Off we<br/>skip like the most heartless things in the world, which is what<br/>children are, but so attractive; and we have an entirely selfish<br/>time, and then when we have need of special attention we nobly<br/>return for it, confident that we shall be rewarded instead of<br/>smacked.<br/><br/>So great indeed was their faith in a mother's love that they<br/>felt they could afford to be callous for a bit longer.<br/><br/>But there was one there who knew better, and when Wendy finished<br/>he uttered a hollow groan.<br/><br/>"What is it, Peter?" she cried, running to him, thinking he was<br/>ill. She felt him solicitously, lower down than his chest. "Where<br/>is it, Peter?"<br/><br/>"It isn't that kind of pain," Peter replied darkly.<br/><br/>"Then what kind is it?"<br/><br/>"Wendy, you are wrong about mothers."<br/><br/>
