"Yes. And of course they must see her light, and if they guess<br/>we are near it they are sure to let fly."<br/><br/>"Wendy!"<br/><br/>"John!"<br/><br/>"Michael!"<br/><br/>"Tell her to go away at once, Peter," the three cried<br/>simultaneously, but he refused.<br/><br/>"She thinks we have lost the way," he replied stiffly, "and she<br/>is rather frightened. You don't think I would send her away all by<br/>herself when she is frightened!"<br/><br/>For a moment the circle of light was broken, and something gave<br/>Peter a loving little pinch.<br/><br/>"Then tell her," Wendy begged, "to put out her light."<br/><br/>"She can't put it out. That is about the only thing fairies<br/>can't do. It just goes out of itself when she falls asleep, same as<br/>the stars."<br/><br/>"Then tell her to sleep at once," John almost ordered.<br/><br/>"She can't sleep except when she's sleepy. It is the only other<br/>thing fairies can't do."<br/>
