"It will soon be over, father," John said cheerily, and then in<br/>rushed Wendy with the medicine in a glass.<br/><br/>"I have been as quick as I could," she panted.<br/><br/>"You have been wonderfully quick," her father retorted, with a<br/>vindictive politeness that was quite thrown away upon her. "Michael<br/>first," he said doggedly.<br/><br/>"Father first," said Michael, who was of a suspicious<br/>nature.<br/><br/>"I shall be sick, you know," Mr. Darling said threateningly.<br/><br/>"Come on, father," said John.<br/><br/>"Hold your tongue, John," his father rapped out.<br/><br/>Wendy was quite puzzled. "I thought you took it quite easily,<br/>father."<br/><br/>"That is not the point," he retorted. "The point is, that there<br/>is more in my glass than in Michael's spoon." His proud heart was<br/>nearly bursting. "And it isn't fair: I would say it though it were<br/>with my last breath; it isn't fair."<br/><br/>"Father, I am waiting," said Michael coldly.<br/><br/>"It's all very well to say you are waiting; so am I<br/>waiting."<br/>
