<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>4<br/>THE FLIGHT<br/><br/><br/>"Second to the right, and straight on till<br/>morning."<br/><br/>That, Peter had told Wendy, was the way to the Neverland; but<br/>even birds, carrying maps and consulting them at windy corners,<br/>could not have sighted it with these instructions. Peter, you see,<br/>just said anything that came into his head.<br/><br/>At first his companions trusted him implicitly, and so great<br/>were the delights of flying that they wasted time circling round<br/>church spires or any other tall objects on the way that took their<br/>fancy.<br/><br/>John and Michael raced, Michael getting a start.<br/><br/>They recalled with contempt that not so long ago they had<br/>thought themselves fine fellows for being able to fly round a<br/>room.<br/><br/>Not long ago. But how long ago? They were flying over the sea<br/>before this thought began to disturb Wendy seriously. John thought<br/>it was their second sea and their third night.<br/><br/>Sometimes it was dark and sometimes light, and now they were<br/>very cold and again too warm. Did they really feel hungry at times,<br/>or were they merely pretending, because Peter had such a jolly new<br/>way of feeding them? His way was to pursue birds who had food in<br/>their mouths suitable for humans and snatch it from them; then the<br/>birds would follow and snatch it back; and they would all go<br/>chasing each other gaily for miles, parting at last with mutual<br/>expressions of good-will. But Wendy noticed with gentle concern<br/>that Peter did not seem to know that this was rather an odd way of<br/>getting your bread and butter, nor even that there are other<br/>ways.<br/>
