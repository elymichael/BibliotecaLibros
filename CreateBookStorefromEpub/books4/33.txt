"Oo," and her arms went out to him.

"And you could darn our clothes, and make pockets for us. None
of us has any pockets."

How could she resist. "Of course it's awfully fascinating!" she
cried. "Peter, would you teach John and Michael to fly too?"

"If you like," he said indifferently, and she ran to John and
Michael and shook them. "Wake up," she cried, "Peter Pan has come
and he is to teach us to fly."
