"That fiend!" Mr. Darling would cry, and Nana's bark was the<br/>echo of it, but Mrs. Darling never upbraided Peter; there was<br/>something in the right-hand corner of her mouth that wanted her not<br/>to call Peter names.<br/><br/>They would sit there in the empty nursery, recalling fondly<br/>every smallest detail of that dreadful evening. It had begun so<br/>uneventfully, so precisely like a hundred other evenings, with Nana<br/>putting on the water for Michael's bath and carrying him to it on<br/>her back.<br/><br/>"I won't go to bed," he had shouted, like one who still believed<br/>that he had the last word on the subject, "I won't, I won't. Nana,<br/>it isn't six o'clock yet. Oh dear, oh dear, I shan't love you any<br/>more, Nana. I tell you I won't be bathed, I won't, I won't!"<br/><br/>Then Mrs. Darling had come in, wearing her white evening-gown.<br/>She had dressed early because Wendy so loved to see her in her<br/>evening-gown, with the necklace George had given her. She was<br/>wearing Wendy's bracelet on her arm; she had asked for the loan of<br/>it. Wendy loved to lend her bracelet to her mother.<br/><br/>She had found her two older children playing at being herself<br/>and father on the occasion of Wendy's birth, and John was<br/>saying:<br/><br/>"I am happy to inform you, Mrs. Darling, that you are now a<br/>mother," in just such a tone as Mr. Darling himself may have used<br/>on the real occasion.<br/><br/>Wendy had danced with joy, just as the real Mrs. Darling must<br/>have done.<br/><br/>Then John was born, with the extra pomp that he conceived due to<br/>the birth of a male, and Michael came from his bath to ask to be<br/>born also, but John said brutally that they did not want any<br/>more.<br/><br/>Michael had nearly cried. "Nobody wants me," he said, and of<br/>course the lady in the evening-dress could not stand that.<br/><br/>"I do," she said, "I so want a third child."<br/><br/>"Boy or girl?" asked Michael, not too hopefully.<br/>
