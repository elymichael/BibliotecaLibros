<br/>"But, my dear madam, it is ten days till Thursday week; so that<br/>by telling you what's what, we can save you ten days of<br/>unhappiness."<br/><br/>"Yes, but at what a cost! By depriving the children of ten<br/>minutes of delight."<br/><br/>"Oh, if you look at it in that way!"<br/><br/>"What other way is there in which to look at it?"<br/><br/>You see, the woman had no proper spirit. I had meant to say<br/>extraordinarily nice things about her; but I despise her, and not<br/>one of them will I say now. She does not really need to be told to<br/>have things ready, for they are ready. All the beds are aired, and<br/>she never leaves the house, and observe, the window is open. For<br/>all the use we are to her, we might well go back to the ship.<br/>However, as we are here we may as well stay and look on. That is<br/>all we are, lookers-on. Nobody really wants us. So let us watch and<br/>say jaggy things, in the hope that some of them will hurt.<br/><br/>The only change to be seen in the night-nursery is that between<br/>nine and six the kennel is no longer there. When the children flew<br/>away, Mr. Darling felt in his bones that all the blame was his for<br/>having chained Nana up, and that from first to last she had been<br/>wiser than he. Of course, as we have seen, he was quite a simple<br/>man; indeed he might have passed for a boy again if he had been<br/>able to take his baldness off; but he had also a noble sense of<br/>justice and a lion's courage to do what seemed right to him; and<br/>having thought the matter out with anxious care after the flight of<br/>the children, he went down on all fours and crawled into the<br/>kennel. To all Mrs. Darling's dear invitations to him to come out<br/>he replied sadly but firmly:<br/><br/>"No, my own one, this is the place for me."<br/><br/>In the bitterness of his remorse he swore that he would never<br/>leave the kennel until his children came back. Of course this was a<br/>pity; but whatever Mr. Darling did he had to do in excess,<br/>otherwise he soon gave up doing it. And there never was a more<br/>humble man than the once proud George Darling, as he sat in the<br/>kennel of an evening talking with his wife of their children and<br/>all their pretty ways.<br/><br/>Very touching was his deference to Nana. He would not let her<br/>come into the kennel, but on all other matters he followed her<br/>wishes implicitly.<br/><br/>Every morning the kennel was carried with Mr. Darling in it to a<br/>cab, which conveyed him to his office, and he returned home in the<br/>same way at six. Something of the strength of character of the man<br/>will be seen if we remember how sensitive he was to the opinion of<br/>neighbours: this man whose every movement now attracted surprised<br/>attention. Inwardly he must have suffered torture; but he preserved<br/>a calm exterior even when the young criticised his little home, and<br/>he always lifted his hat courteously to any lady who looked<br/>inside.<br/><br/>
