At this moment Wendy was grand. "These are my last words, dear
boys," she said firmly. "I feel that I have a message to you from
your real mothers, and it is this: 'We hope our sons will die like
English gentlemen.'"

Even the pirates were awed, and Tootles cried out hysterically,
"I am going to do what my mother hopes. What are you to do,
Nibs?"

"What my mother hopes. What are you to do, Twin?"

"What my mother hopes. John, what areâ€”"

But Hook had found his voice again.

"Tie her up!" he shouted.

It was Smee who tied her to the mast. "See here, honey," he
whispered, "I'll save you if you promise to be my mother."

But not even for Smee would she make such a promise. "I would
almost rather have no children at all," she said disdainfully
[scornfully].

It is sad to know that not a boy was looking at her as Smee tied
her to the mast; the eyes of all were on the plank: that last
little walk they were about to take. They were no longer able to
hope that they would walk it manfully, for the capacity to think
had gone from them; they could stare and shiver only.

Hook smiled on them with his teeth closed, and took a step
toward Wendy. His intention was to turn her face so that she should
see they boys walking the plank one by one. But he never reached
her, he never heard the cry of anguish he hoped to wring from her.
He heard something else instead.

It was the terrible tick-tick of the crocodile.
