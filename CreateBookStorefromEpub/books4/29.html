<br/>This flattered Wendy immensely. "I think," she said, "it is<br/>perfectly lovely the way you talk about girls; John there just<br/>despises us."<br/><br/>For reply Peter rose and kicked John out of bed, blankets and<br/>all; one kick. This seemed to Wendy rather forward for a first<br/>meeting, and she told him with spirit that he was not captain in<br/>her house. However, John continued to sleep so placidly on the<br/>floor that she allowed him to remain there. "And I know you meant<br/>to be kind," she said, relenting, "so you may give me a kiss."<br/><br/>For the moment she had forgotten his ignorance about kisses. "I<br/>thought you would want it back," he said a little bitterly, and<br/>offered to return her the thimble.<br/><br/>"Oh dear," said the nice Wendy, "I don't mean a kiss, I mean a<br/>thimble."<br/><br/>"What's that?"<br/><br/>"It's like this." She kissed him.<br/><br/>"Funny!" said Peter gravely. "Now shall I give you a<br/>thimble?"<br/><br/>"If you wish to," said Wendy, keeping her head erect this<br/>time.<br/><br/>Peter thimbled her, and almost immediately she screeched. "What<br/>is it, Wendy?"<br/><br/>"It was exactly as if someone were pulling my hair."<br/><br/>
