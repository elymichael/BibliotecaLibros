Now I understand what had hitherto puzzled me, why when Peter<br/>had exterminated the pirates he did not return to the island and<br/>leave Tink to escort the children to the mainland. This trick had<br/>been in his head all the time.<br/><br/>Instead of feeling that he was behaving badly he danced with<br/>glee; then he peeped into the day-nursery to see who was playing.<br/>He whispered to Tink, "It's Wendy's mother! She is a pretty lady,<br/>but not so pretty as my mother. Her mouth is full of thimbles, but<br/>not so full as my mother's was."<br/><br/>Of course he knew nothing whatever about his mother; but he<br/>sometimes bragged about her.<br/><br/>He did not know the tune, which was "Home, Sweet Home," but he<br/>knew it was saying, "Come back, Wendy, Wendy, Wendy"; and he cried<br/>exultantly, "You will never see Wendy again, lady, for the window<br/>is barred!"<br/><br/>He peeped in again to see why the music had stopped, and now he<br/>saw that Mrs. Darling had laid her head on the box, and that two<br/>tears were sitting on her eyes.<br/><br/>"She wants me to unbar the window," thought Peter, "but I won't,<br/>not I!"<br/><br/>He peeped again, and the tears were still there, or another two<br/>had taken their place.<br/><br/>"She's awfully fond of Wendy," he said to himself. He was angry<br/>with her now for not seeing why she could not have Wendy.<br/><br/>The reason was so simple: "I'm fond of her too. We can't both<br/>have her, lady."<br/><br/>But the lady would not make the best of it, and he was unhappy.<br/>He ceased to look at her, but even then she would not let go of<br/>him. He skipped about and made funny faces, but when he stopped it<br/>was just as if she were inside him, knocking.<br/><br/>"Oh, all right," he said at last, and gulped. Then he unbarred<br/>the window. "Come on, Tink," he cried, with a frightful sneer at<br/>the laws of nature; "we don't want any silly mothers;" and he flew<br/>away.<br/>
