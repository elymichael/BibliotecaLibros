"Are you ready, boys?"

"Ay, ay," from various parts of the lagoon.

"Then lam into the pirates."

The fight was short and sharp. First to draw blood was John, who
gallantly climbed into the boat and held Starkey. There was fierce
struggle, in which the cutlass was torn from the pirate's grasp. He
wriggled overboard and John leapt after him. The dinghy drifted
away.

Here and there a head bobbed up in the water, and there was a
flash of steel followed by a cry or a whoop. In the confusion some
struck at their own side. The corkscrew of Smee got Tootles in the
fourth rib, but he was himself pinked [nicked] in turn by Curly.
Farther from the rock Starkey was pressing Slightly and the twins
hard.

Where all this time was Peter? He was seeking bigger game.

The others were all brave boys, and they must not be blamed for
backing from the pirate captain. His iron claw made a circle of
dead water round him, from which they fled like affrighted
fishes.

But there was one who did not fear him: there was one prepared
to enter that circle.

Strangely, it was not in the water that they met. Hook rose to
the rock to breathe, and at the same moment Peter scaled it on the
opposite side. The rock was slippery as a ball, and they had to
crawl rather than climb. Neither knew that the other was coming.
Each feeling for a grip met the other's arm: in surprise they
raised their heads; their faces were almost touching; so they
met.

Some of the greatest heroes have confessed that just before they
fell to [began combat] they had a sinking [feeling in the stomach].
Had it been so with Peter at that moment I would admit it. After
all, he was the only man that the Sea-Cook had feared. But Peter
had no sinking, he had one feeling only, gladness; and he gnashed
his pretty teeth with joy. Quick as thought he snatched a knife
from Hook's belt and was about to drive it home, when he saw that
he was higher up the rock that his foe. It would not have been
fighting fair. He gave the pirate a hand to help him up.

It was then that Hook bit him.
