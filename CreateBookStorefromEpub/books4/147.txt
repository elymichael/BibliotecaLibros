"Something!" echoed Mullins.

"What of Cecco?" demanded Noodler.

"He's as dead as Jukes," said Hook shortly.

His reluctance to return to the cabin impressed them all
unfavourably, and the mutinous sounds again broke forth. All
pirates are superstitious, and Cookson cried, "They do say the
surest sign a ship's accurst is when there's one on board more than
can be accounted for."

"I've heard," muttered Mullins, "he always boards the pirate
craft last. Had he a tail, captain?"

"They say," said another, looking viciously at Hook, "that when
he comes it's in the likeness of the wickedest man aboard."

"Had he a hook, captain?" asked Cookson insolently; and one
after another took up the cry, "The ship's doomed!" At this the
children could not resist raising a cheer. Hook had well-nigh
forgotten his prisoners, but as he swung round on them now his face
lit up again.

"Lads," he cried to his crew, "now here's a notion. Open the
cabin door and drive them in. Let them fight the doodle-doo for
their lives. If they kill him, we're so much the better; if he
kills them, we're none the worse."

For the last time his dogs admired Hook, and devotedly they did
his bidding. The boys, pretending to struggle, were pushed into the
cabin and the door was closed on them.

"Now, listen!" cried Hook, and all listened. But not one dared
to face the door. Yes, one, Wendy, who all this time had been bound
to the mast. It was for neither a scream nor a crow that she was
watching, it was for the reappearance of Peter.

She had not long to wait. In the cabin he had found the thing
for which he had gone in search: the key that would free the
children of their manacles, and now they all stole forth, armed
with such weapons as they could find. First signing them to hide,
Peter cut Wendy's bonds, and then nothing could have been easier
than for them all to fly off together; but one thing barred the
way, an oath, "Hook or me this time." So when he had freed Wendy,
he whispered for her to conceal herself with the others, and
himself took her place by the mast, her cloak around him so that he
should pass for her. Then he took a great breath and crowed.
