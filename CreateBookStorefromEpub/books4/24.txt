But she was exulting in his ignorance. "I shall sew it on for
you, my little man," she said, though he was tall as herself, and
she got out her housewife [sewing bag], and sewed the shadow on to
Peter's foot.

"I daresay it will hurt a little," she warned him.

"Oh, I shan't cry," said Peter, who was already of the opinion
that he had never cried in his life. And he clenched his teeth and
did not cry, and soon his shadow was behaving properly, though
still a little creased.

"Perhaps I should have ironed it," Wendy said thoughtfully, but
Peter, boylike, was indifferent to appearances, and he was now
jumping about in the wildest glee. Alas, he had already forgotten
that he owed his bliss to Wendy. He thought he had attached the
shadow himself. "How clever I am!" he crowed rapturously, "oh, the
cleverness of me!"

It is humiliating to have to confess that this conceit of Peter
was one of his most fascinating qualities. To put it with brutal
frankness, there never was a cockier boy.

But for the moment Wendy was shocked. "You conceit [braggart],"
she exclaimed, with frightful sarcasm; "of course I did
nothing!"

"You did a little," Peter said carelessly, and continued to
dance.

"A little!" she replied with hauteur [pride]; "if I am no use I
can at least withdraw," and she sprang in the most dignified way
into bed and covered her face with the blankets.

To induce her to look up he pretended to be going away, and when
this failed he sat on the end of the bed and tapped her gently with
his foot. "Wendy," he said, "don't withdraw. I can't help crowing,
Wendy, when I'm pleased with myself." Still she would not look up,
though she was listening eagerly. "Wendy," he continued, in a voice
that no woman has ever yet been able to resist, "Wendy, one girl is
more use than twenty boys."

Now Wendy was every inch a woman, though there were not very
many inches, and she peeped out of the bed-clothes.

"Do you really think so, Peter?"
