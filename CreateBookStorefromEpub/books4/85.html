<br/>"O evil day!" cried Starkey.<br/><br/>"What's a mother?" asked the ignorant Smee.<br/><br/>Wendy was so shocked that she exclaimed. "He doesn't know!" and<br/>always after this she felt that if you could have a pet pirate Smee<br/>would be her one.<br/><br/>Peter pulled her beneath the water, for Hook had started up,<br/>crying, "What was that?"<br/><br/>"I heard nothing," said Starkey, raising the lantern over the<br/>waters, and as the pirates looked they saw a strange sight. It was<br/>the nest I have told you of, floating on the lagoon, and the Never<br/>bird was sitting on it.<br/><br/>"See," said Hook in answer to Smee's question, "that is a<br/>mother. What a lesson! The nest must have fallen into the water,<br/>but would the mother desert her eggs? No."<br/><br/>There was a break in his voice, as if for a moment he recalled<br/>innocent days whenâ€”but he brushed away this weakness with his<br/>hook.<br/><br/>Smee, much impressed, gazed at the bird as the nest was borne<br/>past, but the more suspicious Starkey said, "If she is a mother,<br/>perhaps she is hanging about here to help Peter."<br/><br/>Hook winced. "Ay," he said, "that is the fear that haunts<br/>me."<br/><br/>He was roused from this dejection by Smee's eager voice.<br/><br/>
