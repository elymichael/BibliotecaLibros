"Then I refuse," he cried, banging the barrel in front of
Hook.

"And I refuse," cried Michael.

"Rule Britannia!" squeaked Curly.

The infuriated pirates buffeted them in the mouth; and Hook
roared out, "That seals your doom. Bring up their mother. Get the
plank ready."

They were only boys, and they went white as they saw Jukes and
Cecco preparing the fatal plank. But they tried to look brave when
Wendy was brought up.

No words of mine can tell you how Wendy despised those pirates.
To the boys there was at least some glamour in the pirate calling;
but all that she saw was that the ship had not been tidied for
years. There was not a porthole on the grimy glass of which you
might not have written with your finger "Dirty pig"; and she had
already written it on several. But as the boys gathered round her
she had no thought, of course, save for them.

"So, my beauty," said Hook, as if he spoke in syrup, "you are to
see your children walk the plank."

Fine gentlemen though he was, the intensity of his communings
had soiled his ruff, and suddenly he knew that she was gazing at
it. With a hasty gesture he tried to hide it, but he was too
late.

"Are they to die?" asked Wendy, with a look of such frightful
contempt that he nearly fainted.

"They are," he snarled. "Silence all," he called gloatingly,
"for a mother's last words to her children."
