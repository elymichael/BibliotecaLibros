<br/>"Free!"<br/><br/>"Yes, cut her bonds and let her go."<br/><br/>"But, captainâ€”"<br/><br/>"At once, d'ye hear," cried Peter, "or I'll plunge my hook in<br/>you."<br/><br/>"This is queer!" Smee gasped.<br/><br/>"Better do what the captain orders," said Starkey nervously.<br/><br/>"Ay, ay." Smee said, and he cut Tiger Lily's cords. At once like<br/>an eel she slid between Starkey's legs into the water.<br/><br/>Of course Wendy was very elated over Peter's cleverness; but she<br/>knew that he would be elated also and very likely crow and thus<br/>betray himself, so at once her hand went out to cover his mouth.<br/>But it was stayed even in the act, for "Boat ahoy!" rang over the<br/>lagoon in Hook's voice, and this time it was not Peter who had<br/>spoken.<br/><br/>Peter may have been about to crow, but his face puckered in a<br/>whistle of surprise instead.<br/><br/>"Boat ahoy!" again came the voice.<br/><br/>
