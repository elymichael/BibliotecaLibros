"Let us all slip into our beds, and be there when she comes in,
just as if we had never been away."

And so when Mrs. Darling went back to the night-nursery to see
if her husband was asleep, all the beds were occupied. The children
waited for her cry of joy, but it did not come. She saw them, but
she did not believe they were there. You see, she saw them in their
beds so often in her dreams that she thought this was just the
dream hanging around her still.

She sat down in the chair by the fire, where in the old days she
had nursed them.

They could not understand this, and a cold fear fell upon all
the three of them.

"Mother!" Wendy cried.

"That's Wendy," she said, but still she was sure it was the
dream.

"Mother!"

"That's John," she said.

"Mother!" cried Michael. He knew her now.

"That's Michael," she said, and she stretched out her arms for
the three little selfish children they would never envelop again.
Yes, they did, they went round Wendy and John and Michael, who had
slipped out of bed and run to her.
