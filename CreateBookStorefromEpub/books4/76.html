"Very well," she said, "I will do my best. Come inside at once,<br/>you naughty children; I am sure your feet are damp. And before I<br/>put you to bed I have just time to finish the story of<br/>Cinderella."<br/><br/>In they went; I don't know how there was room for them, but you<br/>can squeeze very tight in the Neverland. And that was the first of<br/>the many joyous evenings they had with Wendy. By and by she tucked<br/>them up in the great bed in the home under the trees, but she<br/>herself slept that night in the little house, and Peter kept watch<br/>outside with drawn sword, for the pirates could be heard carousing<br/>far away and the wolves were on the prowl. The little house looked<br/>so cosy and safe in the darkness, with a bright light showing<br/>through its blinds, and the chimney smoking beautifully, and Peter<br/>standing on guard. After a time he fell asleep, and some unsteady<br/>fairies had to climb over him on their way home from an orgy. Any<br/>of the other boys obstructing the fairy path at night they would<br/>have mischiefed, but they just tweaked Peter's nose and passed<br/>on.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
