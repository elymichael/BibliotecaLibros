Of course Peter had been trifling with them, for no one can fly<br/>unless the fairy dust has been blown on him. Fortunately, as we<br/>have mentioned, one of his hands was messy with it, and he blew<br/>some on each of them, with the most superb results.<br/><br/>"Now just wiggle your shoulders this way," he said, "and let<br/>go."<br/><br/>They were all on their beds, and gallant Michael let go first.<br/>He did not quite mean to let go, but he did it, and immediately he<br/>was borne across the room.<br/><br/>"I flewed!" he screamed while still in mid-air.<br/><br/>John let go and met Wendy near the bathroom.<br/><br/>"Oh, lovely!"<br/><br/>"Oh, ripping!"<br/><br/>"Look at me!"<br/><br/>"Look at me!"<br/><br/>"Look at me!"<br/><br/>They were not nearly so elegant as Peter, they could not help<br/>kicking a little, but their heads were bobbing against the ceiling,<br/>and there is almost nothing so delicious as that. Peter gave Wendy<br/>a hand at first, but had to desist, Tink was so indignant.<br/>
