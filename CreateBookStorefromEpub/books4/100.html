<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>10<br/>THE HAPPY HOME<br/><br/><br/>One important result of the brush [with the pirates] on the<br/>lagoon was that it made the redskins their friends. Peter had saved<br/>Tiger Lily from a dreadful fate, and now there was nothing she and<br/>her braves would not do for him. All night they sat above, keeping<br/>watch over the home under the ground and awaiting the big attack by<br/>the pirates which obviously could not be much longer delayed. Even<br/>by day they hung about, smoking the pipe of peace, and looking<br/>almost as if they wanted tit-bits to eat.<br/><br/>They called Peter the Great White Father, prostrating themselves<br/>[lying down] before him; and he liked this tremendously, so that it<br/>was not really good for him.<br/><br/>"The great white father," he would say to them in a very lordly<br/>manner, as they grovelled at his feet, "is glad to see the<br/>Piccaninny warriors protecting his wigwam from the pirates."<br/><br/>"Me Tiger Lily," that lovely creature would reply. "Peter Pan<br/>save me, me his velly nice friend. Me no let pirates hurt him."<br/><br/>She was far too pretty to cringe in this way, but Peter thought<br/>it his due, and he would answer condescendingly, "It is good. Peter<br/>Pan has spoken."<br/><br/>Always when he said, "Peter Pan has spoken," it meant that they<br/>must now shut up, and they accepted it humbly in that spirit; but<br/>they were by no means so respectful to the other boys, whom they<br/>looked upon as just ordinary braves. They said "How-do?" to them,<br/>and things like that; and what annoyed the boys was that Peter<br/>seemed to think this all right.<br/><br/>Secretly Wendy sympathised with them a little, but she was far<br/>too loyal a housewife to listen to any complaints against father.<br/>"Father knows best," she always said, whatever her private opinion<br/>must be. Her private opinion was that the redskins should not call<br/>her a squaw.<br/>
