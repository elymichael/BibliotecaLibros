This flattered Wendy immensely. "I think," she said, "it is
perfectly lovely the way you talk about girls; John there just
despises us."

For reply Peter rose and kicked John out of bed, blankets and
all; one kick. This seemed to Wendy rather forward for a first
meeting, and she told him with spirit that he was not captain in
her house. However, John continued to sleep so placidly on the
floor that she allowed him to remain there. "And I know you meant
to be kind," she said, relenting, "so you may give me a kiss."

For the moment she had forgotten his ignorance about kisses. "I
thought you would want it back," he said a little bitterly, and
offered to return her the thimble.

"Oh dear," said the nice Wendy, "I don't mean a kiss, I mean a
thimble."

"What's that?"

"It's like this." She kissed him.

"Funny!" said Peter gravely. "Now shall I give you a
thimble?"

"If you wish to," said Wendy, keeping her head erect this
time.

Peter thimbled her, and almost immediately she screeched. "What
is it, Wendy?"

"It was exactly as if someone were pulling my hair."
