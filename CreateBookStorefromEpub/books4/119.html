<br/>"She says she won't!" Nibs exclaimed, aghast at such<br/>insubordination, whereupon Peter went sternly toward the young<br/>lady's chamber.<br/><br/>"Tink," he rapped out, "if you don't get up and dress at once I<br/>will open the curtains, and then we shall all see you in your<br/>negligee [nightgown]."<br/><br/>This made her leap to the floor. "Who said I wasn't getting up?"<br/>she cried.<br/><br/>In the meantime the boys were gazing very forlornly at Wendy,<br/>now equipped with John and Michael for the journey. By this time<br/>they were dejected, not merely because they were about to lose her,<br/>but also because they felt that she was going off to something nice<br/>to which they had not been invited. Novelty was beckoning to them<br/>as usual.<br/><br/>Crediting them with a nobler feeling Wendy melted.<br/><br/>"Dear ones," she said, "if you will all come with me I feel<br/>almost sure I can get my father and mother to adopt you."<br/><br/>The invitation was meant specially for Peter, but each of the<br/>boys was thinking exclusively of himself, and at once they jumped<br/>with joy.<br/><br/>"But won't they think us rather a handful?" Nibs asked in the<br/>middle of his jump.<br/><br/>"Oh no," said Wendy, rapidly thinking it out, "it will only mean<br/>having a few beds in the drawing-room; they can be hidden behind<br/>the screens on first Thursdays."<br/><br/>"Peter, can we go?" they all cried imploringly. They took it for<br/>granted that if they went he would go also, but really they<br/>scarcely cared. Thus children are ever ready, when novelty knocks,<br/>to desert their dearest ones.<br/><br/>
