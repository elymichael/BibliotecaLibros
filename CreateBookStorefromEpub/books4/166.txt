"There are always a lot of young ones," explained Wendy, who was
now quite an authority, "because you see when a new baby laughs for
the first time a new fairy is born, and as there are always new
babies there are always new fairies. They live in nests on the tops
of trees; and the mauve ones are boys and the white ones are girls,
and the blue ones are just little sillies who are not sure what
they are."

"I shall have such fun," said Peter, with eye on Wendy.

"It will be rather lonely in the evening," she said, "sitting by
the fire."

"I shall have Tink."

"Tink can't go a twentieth part of the way round," she reminded
him a little tartly.

"Sneaky tell-tale!" Tink called out from somewhere round the
corner.

"It doesn't matter," Peter said.

"O Peter, you know it matters."

"Well, then, come with me to the little house."

"May I, mummy?"

"Certainly not. I have got you home again, and I mean to keep
you."
