"Well, then, we could go on," said John.

"That is the awful thing, John. We should have to go on, for we
don't know how to stop."

This was true, Peter had forgotten to show them how to stop.

John said that if the worst came to the worst, all they had to
do was to go straight on, for the world was round, and so in time
they must come back to their own window.

"And who is to get food for us, John?"

"I nipped a bit out of that eagle's mouth pretty neatly,
Wendy."

"After the twentieth try," Wendy reminded him. "And even though
we became good a picking up food, see how we bump against clouds
and things if he is not near to give us a hand."

Indeed they were constantly bumping. They could now fly
strongly, though they still kicked far too much; but if they saw a
cloud in front of them, the more they tried to avoid it, the more
certainly did they bump into it. If Nana had been with them, she
would have had a bandage round Michael's forehead by this time.

Peter was not with them for the moment, and they felt rather
lonely up there by themselves. He could go so much faster than they
that he would suddenly shoot out of sight, to have some adventure
in which they had no share. He would come down laughing over
something fearfully funny he had been saying to a star, but he had
already forgotten what it was, or he would come up with mermaid
scales still sticking to him, and yet not be able to say for
certain what had been happening. It was really rather irritating to
children who had never seen a mermaid.

"And if he forgets them so quickly," Wendy argued, "how can we
expect that he will go on remembering us?"

Indeed, sometimes when he returned he did not remember them, at
least not well. Wendy was sure of it. She saw recognition come into
his eyes as he was about to pass them the time of day and go on;
once even she had to call him by name.
