It was quite true; the leaves had been found very near the
window.

Mrs. Darling did not know what to think, for it all seemed so
natural to Wendy that you could not dismiss it by saying she had
been dreaming.

"My child," the mother cried, "why did you not tell me of this
before?"

"I forgot," said Wendy lightly. She was in a hurry to get her
breakfast.

Oh, surely she must have been dreaming.

But, on the other hand, there were the leaves. Mrs. Darling
examined them very carefully; they were skeleton leaves, but she
was sure they did not come from any tree that grew in England. She
crawled about the floor, peering at it with a candle for marks of a
strange foot. She rattled the poker up the chimney and tapped the
walls. She let down a tape from the window to the pavement, and it
was a sheer drop of thirty feet, without so much as a spout to
climb up by.

Certainly Wendy had been dreaming.

But Wendy had not been dreaming, as the very next night showed,
the night on which the extraordinary adventures of these children
may be said to have begun.

On the night we speak of all the children were once more in bed.
It happened to be Nana's evening off, and Mrs. Darling had bathed
them and sung to them till one by one they had let go her hand and
slid away into the land of sleep.

All were looking so safe and cosy that she smiled at her fears
now and sat down tranquilly by the fire to sew.

It was something for Michael, who on his birthday was getting
into shirts. The fire was warm, however, and the nursery dimly lit
by three night-lights, and presently the sewing lay on Mrs.
Darling's lap. Then her head nodded, oh, so gracefully. She was
asleep. Look at the four of them, Wendy and Michael over there,
John here, and Mrs. Darling by the fire. There should have been a
fourth night-light.
