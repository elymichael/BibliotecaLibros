While they talked they heard a distant sound. You or I, not<br/>being wild things of the woods, would have heard nothing, but they<br/>heard it, and it was the grim song:<br/><br/><br/>"Yo ho, yo ho, the pirate life,<br/>The flag o' skull and bones,<br/>A merry hour, a hempen rope,<br/>And hey for Davy Jones."<br/><br/><br/>At once the lost boysâ€”but where are they? They are no longer<br/>there. Rabbits could not have disappeared more quickly.<br/><br/>I will tell you where they are. With the exception of Nibs, who<br/>has darted away to reconnoitre [look around], they are already in<br/>their home under the ground, a very delightful residence of which<br/>we shall see a good deal presently. But how have they reached it?<br/>for there is no entrance to be seen, not so much as a large stone,<br/>which if rolled away, would disclose the mouth of a cave. Look<br/>closely, however, and you may note that there are here seven large<br/>trees, each with a hole in its hollow trunk as large as a boy.<br/>These are the seven entrances to the home under the ground, for<br/>which Hook has been searching in vain these many moons. Will he<br/>find it tonight?<br/><br/>As the pirates advanced, the quick eye of Starkey sighted Nibs<br/>disappearing through the wood, and at once his pistol flashed out.<br/>But an iron claw gripped his shoulder.<br/><br/>"Captain, let go!" he cried, writhing.<br/><br/>Now for the first time we hear the voice of Hook. It was a black<br/>voice. "Put back that pistol first," it said threateningly.<br/><br/>"It was one of those boys you hate. I could have shot him<br/>dead."<br/><br/>
