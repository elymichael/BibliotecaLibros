"Yes, so do I. What was the last thing Peter ever said to<br/>you?"<br/><br/>"The last thing he ever said to me was, 'Just always be waiting<br/>for me, and then some night you will hear me crowing.'"<br/><br/>"Yes."<br/><br/>"But, alas, he forgot all about me," Wendy said it with a smile.<br/>She was as grown up as that.<br/><br/>"What did his crow sound like?" Jane asked one evening.<br/><br/>"It was like this," Wendy said, trying to imitate Peter's<br/>crow.<br/><br/>"No, it wasn't," Jane said gravely, "it was like this;" and she<br/>did it ever so much better than her mother.<br/><br/>Wendy was a little startled. "My darling, how can you know?"<br/><br/>"I often hear it when I am sleeping," Jane said.<br/><br/>"Ah yes, many girls hear it when they are sleeping, but I was<br/>the only one who heard it awake."<br/><br/>"Lucky you," said Jane.<br/>
