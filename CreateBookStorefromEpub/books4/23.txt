"Don't have a mother," he said. Not only had he no mother, but
he had not the slightest desire to have one. He thought them very
over-rated persons. Wendy, however, felt at once that she was in
the presence of a tragedy.

"O Peter, no wonder you were crying," she said, and got out of
bed and ran to him.

"I wasn't crying about mothers," he said rather indignantly. "I
was crying because I can't get my shadow to stick on. Besides, I
wasn't crying."

"It has come off?"

"Yes."

Then Wendy saw the shadow on the floor, looking so draggled, and
she was frightfully sorry for Peter. "How awful!" she said, but she
could not help smiling when she saw that he had been trying to
stick it on with soap. How exactly like a boy!

Fortunately she knew at once what to do. "It must be sewn on,"
she said, just a little patronisingly.

"What's sewn?" he asked.

"You're dreadfully ignorant."

"No, I'm not."
