<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>5<br/>THE ISLAND COME TRUE<br/><br/><br/>Feeling that Peter was on his way back, the Neverland had again<br/>woke into life. We ought to use the pluperfect and say wakened, but<br/>woke is better and was always used by Peter.<br/><br/>In his absence things are usually quiet on the island. The<br/>fairies take an hour longer in the morning, the beasts attend to<br/>their young, the redskins feed heavily for six days and nights, and<br/>when pirates and lost boys meet they merely bite their thumbs at<br/>each other. But with the coming of Peter, who hates lethargy, they<br/>are under way again: if you put your ear to the ground now, you<br/>would hear the whole island seething with life.<br/><br/>On this evening the chief forces of the island were disposed as<br/>follows. The lost boys were out looking for Peter, the pirates were<br/>out looking for the lost boys, the redskins were out looking for<br/>the pirates, and the beasts were out looking for the redskins. They<br/>were going round and round the island, but they did not meet<br/>because all were going at the same rate.<br/><br/>All wanted blood except the boys, who liked it as a rule, but<br/>to-night were out to greet their captain. The boys on the island<br/>vary, of course, in numbers, according as they get killed and so<br/>on; and when they seem to be growing up, which is against the<br/>rules, Peter thins them out; but at this time there were six of<br/>them, counting the twins as two. Let us pretend to lie here among<br/>the sugar-cane and watch them as they steal by in single file, each<br/>with his hand on his dagger.<br/><br/>They are forbidden by Peter to look in the least like him, and<br/>they wear the skins of the bears slain by themselves, in which they<br/>are so round and furry that when they fall they roll. They have<br/>therefore become very sure-footed.<br/><br/>The first to pass is Tootles, not the least brave but the most<br/>unfortunate of all that gallant band. He had been in fewer<br/>adventures than any of them, because the big things constantly<br/>happened just when he had stepped round the corner; all would be<br/>quiet, he would take the opportunity of going off to gather a few<br/>sticks for firewood, and then when he returned the others would be<br/>sweeping up the blood. This ill-luck had given a gentle melancholy<br/>to his countenance, but instead of souring his nature had sweetened<br/>it, so that he was quite the humblest of the boys. Poor kind<br/>Tootles, there is danger in the air for you to-night. Take care<br/>lest an adventure is now offered you, which, if accepted, will<br/>plunge you in deepest woe. Tootles, the fairy Tink, who is bent on<br/>mischief this night is looking for a tool [for doing her mischief],<br/>and she thinks you are the most easily tricked of the boys. 'Ware<br/>Tinker Bell.<br/><br/>Would that he could hear us, but we are not really on the<br/>island, and he passes by, biting his knuckles.<br/>
