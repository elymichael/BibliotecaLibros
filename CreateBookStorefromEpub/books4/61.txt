It was not in their nature to question when Peter ordered. "Let
us do what Peter wishes!" cried the simple boys. "Quick, bows and
arrows!"

All but Tootles popped down their trees. He had a bow and arrow
with him, and Tink noted it, and rubbed her little hands.

"Quick, Tootles, quick," she screamed. "Peter will be so
pleased."

Tootles excitedly fitted the arrow to his bow. "Out of the way,
Tink," he shouted, and then he fired, and Wendy fluttered to the
ground with an arrow in her breast.
