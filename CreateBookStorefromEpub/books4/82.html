They had caught her boarding the pirate ship with a knife in her<br/>mouth. No watch was kept on the ship, it being Hook's boast that<br/>the wind of his name guarded the ship for a mile around. Now her<br/>fate would help to guard it also. One more wail would go the round<br/>in that wind by night.<br/><br/>In the gloom that they brought with them the two pirates did not<br/>see the rock till they crashed into it.<br/><br/>"Luff, you lubber," cried an Irish voice that was Smee's;<br/>"here's the rock. Now, then, what we have to do is to hoist the<br/>redskin on to it and leave her here to drown."<br/><br/>It was the work of one brutal moment to land the beautiful girl<br/>on the rock; she was too proud to offer a vain resistance.<br/><br/>Quite near the rock, but out of sight, two heads were bobbing up<br/>and down, Peter's and Wendy's. Wendy was crying, for it was the<br/>first tragedy she had seen. Peter had seen many tragedies, but he<br/>had forgotten them all. He was less sorry than Wendy for Tiger<br/>Lily: it was two against one that angered him, and he meant to save<br/>her. An easy way would have been to wait until the pirates had<br/>gone, but he was never one to choose the easy way.<br/><br/>There was almost nothing he could not do, and he now imitated<br/>the voice of Hook.<br/><br/>"Ahoy there, you lubbers!" he called. It was a marvellous<br/>imitation.<br/><br/>"The captain!" said the pirates, staring at each other in<br/>surprise.<br/><br/>"He must be swimming out to us," Starkey said, when they had<br/>looked for him in vain.<br/><br/>"We are putting the redskin on the rock," Smee called out.<br/><br/>"Set her free," came the astonishing answer.<br/>
