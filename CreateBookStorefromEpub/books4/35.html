<br/>Instead of troubling to answer him Peter flew around the room,<br/>taking the mantelpiece on the way.<br/><br/>"How topping!" said John and Michael.<br/><br/>"How sweet!" cried Wendy.<br/><br/>"Yes, I'm sweet, oh, I am sweet!" said Peter, forgetting his<br/>manners again.<br/><br/>It looked delightfully easy, and they tried it first from the<br/>floor and then from the beds, but they always went down instead of<br/>up.<br/><br/>"I say, how do you do it?" asked John, rubbing his knee. He was<br/>quite a practical boy.<br/><br/>"You just think lovely wonderful thoughts," Peter explained,<br/>"and they lift you up in the air."<br/><br/>He showed them again.<br/><br/>"You're so nippy at it," John said, "couldn't you do it very<br/>slowly once?"<br/><br/>Peter did it both slowly and quickly. "I've got it now, Wendy!"<br/>cried John, but soon he found he had not. Not one of them could fly<br/>an inch, though even Michael was in words of two syllables, and<br/>Peter did not know A from Z.<br/><br/>
