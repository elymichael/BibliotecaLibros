We have now reached the evening that was to be known among them
as the Night of Nights, because of its adventures and their upshot.
The day, as if quietly gathering its forces, had been almost
uneventful, and now the redskins in their blankets were at their
posts above, while, below, the children were having their evening
meal; all except Peter, who had gone out to get the time. The way
you got the time on the island was to find the crocodile, and then
stay near him till the clock struck.

The meal happened to be a make-believe tea, and they sat around
the board, guzzling in their greed; and really, what with their
chatter and recriminations, the noise, as Wendy said, was
positively deafening. To be sure, she did not mind noise, but she
simply would not have them grabbing things, and then excusing
themselves by saying that Tootles had pushed their elbow. There was
a fixed rule that they must never hit back at meals, but should
refer the matter of dispute to Wendy by raising the right arm
politely and saying, "I complain of so-and-so;" but what usually
happened was that they forgot to do this or did it too much.

"Silence," cried Wendy when for the twentieth time she had told
them that they were not all to speak at once. "Is your mug empty,
Slightly darling?"

"Not quite empty, mummy," Slightly said, after looking into an
imaginary mug.

"He hasn't even begun to drink his milk," Nibs interposed.

This was telling, and Slightly seized his chance.

"I complain of Nibs," he cried promptly.

John, however, had held up his hand first.

"Well, John?"

"May I sit in Peter's chair, as he is not here?"
