Didst never want to be a pirate, my<br/>hearty?"<br/><br/>Now John had sometimes experienced this hankering at maths.<br/>prep.; and he was struck by Hook's picking him out.<br/><br/>"I once thought of calling myself Red-handed Jack," he said<br/>diffidently.<br/><br/>"And a good name too. We'll call you that here, bully, if you<br/>join."<br/><br/>"What do you think, Michael?" asked John.<br/><br/>"What would you call me if I join?" Michael demanded.<br/><br/>"Blackbeard Joe."<br/><br/>Michael was naturally impressed. "What do you think, John?" He<br/>wanted John to decide, and John wanted him to decide.<br/><br/>"Shall we still be respectful subjects of the King?"
