"I forget them after I kill them," he replied carelessly.<br/><br/>When she expressed a doubtful hope that Tinker Bell would be<br/>glad to see her he said, "Who is Tinker Bell?"<br/><br/>"O Peter," she said, shocked; but even when she explained he<br/>could not remember.<br/><br/>"There are such a lot of them," he said. "I expect she is no<br/>more."<br/><br/>I expect he was right, for fairies don't live long, but they are<br/>so little that a short time seems a good while to them.<br/><br/>Wendy was pained too to find that the past year was but as<br/>yesterday to Peter; it had seemed such a long year of waiting to<br/>her. But he was exactly as fascinating as ever, and they had a<br/>lovely spring cleaning in the little house on the tree tops.<br/><br/>Next year he did not come for her. She waited in a new frock<br/>because the old one simply would not meet; but he never came.<br/><br/>"Perhaps he is ill," Michael said.<br/><br/>"You know he is never ill."<br/><br/>Michael came close to her and whispered, with a shiver, "Perhaps<br/>there is no such person, Wendy!" and then Wendy would have cried if<br/>Michael had not been crying.<br/><br/>Peter came next spring cleaning; and the strange thing was that<br/>he never knew he had missed a year.<br/>
