"No."

And so the others had to be told.

"Peter isn't coming."

Peter not coming! They gazed blankly at him, their sticks over
their backs, and on each stick a bundle. Their first thought was
that if Peter was not going he had probably changed his mind about
letting them go.

But he was far too proud for that. "If you find your mothers,"
he said darkly, "I hope you will like them."

The awful cynicism of this made an uncomfortable impression, and
most of them began to look rather doubtful. After all, their faces
said, were they not noodles to want to go?

"Now then," cried Peter, "no fuss, no blubbering; good-bye,
Wendy;" and he held out his hand cheerily, quite as if they must
really go now, for he had something important to do.

She had to take his hand, and there was no indication that he
would prefer a thimble.

"You will remember about changing your flannels, Peter?" she
said, lingering over him. She was always so particular about their
flannels.

"Yes."
