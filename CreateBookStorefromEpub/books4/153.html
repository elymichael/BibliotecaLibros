<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>16<br/>THE RETURN HOME<br/><br/><br/>By three bells that morning they were all stirring their stumps<br/>[legs]; for there was a big sea running; and Tootles, the bo'sun,<br/>was among them, with a rope's end in his hand and chewing tobacco.<br/>They all donned pirate clothes cut off at the knee, shaved smartly,<br/>and tumbled up, with the true nautical roll and hitching their<br/>trousers.<br/><br/>It need not be said who was the captain. Nibs and John were<br/>first and second mate. There was a woman aboard. The rest were tars<br/>[sailors] before the mast, and lived in the fo'c'sle. Peter had<br/>already lashed himself to the wheel; but he piped all hands and<br/>delivered a short address to them; said he hoped they would do<br/>their duty like gallant hearties, but that he knew they were the<br/>scum of Rio and the Gold Coast, and if they snapped at him he would<br/>tear them. The bluff strident words struck the note sailors<br/>understood, and they cheered him lustily. Then a few sharp orders<br/>were given, and they turned the ship round, and nosed her for the<br/>mainland.<br/><br/>Captain Pan calculated, after consulting the ship's chart, that<br/>if this weather lasted they should strike the Azores about the 21st<br/>of June, after which it would save time to fly.<br/><br/>Some of them wanted it to be an honest ship and others were in<br/>favour of keeping it a pirate; but the captain treated them as<br/>dogs, and they dared not express their wishes to him even in a<br/>round robin [one person after another, as they had to Cpt. Hook].<br/>Instant obedience was the only safe thing. Slightly got a dozen for<br/>looking perplexed when told to take soundings. The general feeling<br/>was that Peter was honest just now to lull Wendy's suspicions, but<br/>that there might be a change when the new suit was ready, which,<br/>against her will, she was making for him out of some of Hook's<br/>wickedest garments. It was afterwards whispered among them that on<br/>the first night he wore this suit he sat long in the cabin with<br/>Hook's cigar-holder in his mouth and one hand clenched, all but for<br/>the forefinger, which he bent and held threateningly aloft like a<br/>hook.<br/><br/>Instead of watching the ship, however, we must now return to<br/>that desolate home from which three of our characters had taken<br/>heartless flight so long ago. It seems a shame to have neglected<br/>No. 14 all this time; and yet we may be sure that Mrs. Darling does<br/>not blame us. If we had returned sooner to look with sorrowful<br/>sympathy at her, she would probably have cried, "Don't be silly;<br/>what do I matter? Do go back and keep an eye on the children." So<br/>long as mothers are like this their children will take advantage of<br/>them; and they may lay to [bet on] that.<br/><br/>Even now we venture into that familiar nursery only because its<br/>lawful occupants are on their way home; we are merely hurrying on<br/>in advance of them to see that their beds are properly aired and<br/>that Mr. and Mrs. Darling do not go out for the evening. We are no<br/>more than servants. Why on earth should their beds be properly<br/>aired, seeing that they left them in such a thankless hurry? Would<br/>it not serve them jolly well right if they came back and found that<br/>their parents were spending the week-end in the country? It would<br/>be the moral lesson they have been in need of ever since we met<br/>them; but if we contrived things in this way Mrs. Darling would<br/>never forgive us.<br/><br/>One thing I should like to do immensely, and that is to tell<br/>her, in the way authors have, that the children are coming back,<br/>that indeed they will be here on Thursday week. This would spoil so<br/>completely the surprise to which Wendy and John and Michael are<br/>looking forward. They have been planning it out on the ship:<br/>mother's rapture, father's shout of joy, Nana's leap through the<br/>air to embrace them first, when what they ought to be prepared for<br/>is a good hiding. How delicious to spoil it all by breaking the<br/>news in advance; so that when they enter grandly Mrs. Darling may<br/>not even offer Wendy her mouth, and Mr. Darling may exclaim<br/>pettishly, "Dash it all, here are those boys again." However, we<br/>should get no thanks even for this. We are beginning to know Mrs.<br/>Darling by this time, and may be sure that she would upbraid us for<br/>depriving the children of their little pleasure.<br/>
