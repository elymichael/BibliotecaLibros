<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>1<br/>PETER BREAKS THROUGH<br/><br/><br/>All children, except one, grow up. They soon know that they will<br/>grow up, and the way Wendy knew was this. One day when she was two<br/>years old she was playing in a garden, and she plucked another<br/>flower and ran with it to her mother. I suppose she must have<br/>looked rather delightful, for Mrs. Darling put her hand to her<br/>heart and cried, "Oh, why can't you remain like this for ever!"<br/>This was all that passed between them on the subject, but<br/>henceforth Wendy knew that she must grow up. You always know after<br/>you are two. Two is the beginning of the end.<br/><br/>Of course they lived at 14 [their house number on their street],<br/>and until Wendy came her mother was the chief one. She was a lovely<br/>lady, with a romantic mind and such a sweet mocking mouth. Her<br/>romantic mind was like the tiny boxes, one within the other, that<br/>come from the puzzling East, however many you discover there is<br/>always one more; and her sweet mocking mouth had one kiss on it<br/>that Wendy could never get, though there it was, perfectly<br/>conspicuous in the right-hand corner.<br/><br/>The way Mr. Darling won her was this: the many gentlemen who had<br/>been boys when she was a girl discovered simultaneously that they<br/>loved her, and they all ran to her house to propose to her except<br/>Mr. Darling, who took a cab and nipped in first, and so he got her.<br/>He got all of her, except the innermost box and the kiss. He never<br/>knew about the box, and in time he gave up trying for the kiss.<br/>Wendy thought Napoleon could have got it, but I can picture him<br/>trying, and then going off in a passion, slamming the door.<br/><br/>Mr. Darling used to boast to Wendy that her mother not only<br/>loved him but respected him. He was one of those deep ones who know<br/>about stocks and shares. Of course no one really knows, but he<br/>quite seemed to know, and he often said stocks were up and shares<br/>were down in a way that would have made any woman respect him.<br/><br/>Mrs. Darling was married in white, and at first she kept the<br/>books perfectly, almost gleefully, as if it were a game, not so<br/>much as a Brussels sprout was missing; but by and by whole<br/>cauliflowers dropped out, and instead of them there were pictures<br/>of babies without faces. She drew them when she should have been<br/>totting up. They were Mrs. Darling's guesses.<br/><br/>Wendy came first, then John, then Michael.<br/><br/>For a week or two after Wendy came it was doubtful whether they<br/>would be able to keep her, as she was another mouth to feed. Mr.<br/>Darling was frightfully proud of her, but he was very honourable,<br/>and he sat on the edge of Mrs. Darling's bed, holding her hand and<br/>calculating expenses, while she looked at him imploringly. She<br/>wanted to risk it, come what might, but that was not his way; his<br/>way was with a pencil and a piece of paper, and if she confused him<br/>with suggestions he had to begin at the beginning again.<br/>
