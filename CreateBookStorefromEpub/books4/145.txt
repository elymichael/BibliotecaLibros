"The cabin's as black as a pit," Cecco said, almost gibbering,
"but there is something terrible in there: the thing you heard
crowing."

The exultation of the boys, the lowering looks of the pirates,
both were seen by Hook.

"Cecco," he said in his most steely voice, "go back and fetch me
out that doodle-doo."

Cecco, bravest of the brave, cowered before his captain, crying
"No, no"; but Hook was purring to his claw.

"Did you say you would go, Cecco?" he said musingly.

Cecco went, first flinging his arms despairingly. There was no
more singing, all listened now; and again came a death-screech and
again a crow.

No one spoke except Slightly. "Three," he said.

Hook rallied his dogs with a gesture. "'S'death and odds fish,"
he thundered, "who is to bring me that doodle-doo?"

"Wait till Cecco comes out," growled Starkey, and the others
took up the cry.

"I think I heard you volunteer, Starkey," said Hook, purring
again.

"No, by thunder!" Starkey cried.
