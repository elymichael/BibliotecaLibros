"O evil day!" cried Starkey.

"What's a mother?" asked the ignorant Smee.

Wendy was so shocked that she exclaimed. "He doesn't know!" and
always after this she felt that if you could have a pet pirate Smee
would be her one.

Peter pulled her beneath the water, for Hook had started up,
crying, "What was that?"

"I heard nothing," said Starkey, raising the lantern over the
waters, and as the pirates looked they saw a strange sight. It was
the nest I have told you of, floating on the lagoon, and the Never
bird was sitting on it.

"See," said Hook in answer to Smee's question, "that is a
mother. What a lesson! The nest must have fallen into the water,
but would the mother desert her eggs? No."

There was a break in his voice, as if for a moment he recalled
innocent days whenâ€”but he brushed away this weakness with his
hook.

Smee, much impressed, gazed at the bird as the nest was borne
past, but the more suspicious Starkey said, "If she is a mother,
perhaps she is hanging about here to help Peter."

Hook winced. "Ay," he said, "that is the fear that haunts
me."

He was roused from this dejection by Smee's eager voice.
