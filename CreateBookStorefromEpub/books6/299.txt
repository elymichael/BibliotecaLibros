"Upon my word," answered Herbert, "it is rather difficult to say
how it happened. I was, I think, occupied in collecting my plants,
when I heard a noise like an avalanche falling from a very tall
tree. I scarcely had time to look round. This unfortunate man, who
was without doubt concealed in a tree, rushed upon me in less time
than I take to tell you about it, and unless Mr. Spilett and
Pencroft—"

"My boy!" said Cyrus Harding, "you ran a great danger, but,
perhaps, without that, the poor creature would have still hidden
himself from your search, and we should not have had a new
companion."

"You hope, then, Cyrus, to succeed in reforming the man?" asked
the reporter.

"Yes," replied the engineer.

Breakfast over, Harding and his companions left Granite House
and returned to the beach. They there occupied themselves in
unloading the "Bonadventure," and the engineer, having examined the
arms and tools, saw nothing which could help them to establish the
identity of the stranger.

The capture of pigs, made on the islet, was looked upon as being
very profitable to Lincoln Island, and the animals were led to the
sty, where they soon became at home.

The two barrels, containing the powder and shot, as well as the
box of caps, were very welcome. It was agreed to establish a small
powder- magazine, either outside Granite House or in the Upper
Cavern, where there would be no fear of explosion. However, the use
of pyroxyle was to be continued, for this substance giving
excellent results, there was no reason for substituting ordinary
powder.

When the unloading of the vessel was finished,—

"Captain," said Pencroft, "I think it would be prudent to put
our 'Bonadventure' in a safe place."

"Is she not safe at the mouth of the Mercy?" asked Cyrus
Harding.
