"Without any doubt, the island, continents, and the world<br/>itself," replied the engineer. "It is only a question of<br/>quantity."<br/><br/>"Then could you not use this nitro-glycerine for loading<br/>firearms?" asked the sailor.<br/><br/>"No, Pencroft; for it is too explosive a substance. But it would<br/>be easy to make some guncotton, or even ordinary powder, as we have<br/>azotic acid, saltpeter, sulphur, and coal. Unhappily, it is the<br/>guns which we have not got.<br/><br/>"Oh, captain," replied the sailor, "with a little<br/>determinationâ€”"<br/><br/>Pencroft had erased the word "impossible" from the dictionary of<br/>Lincoln Island.<br/><br/>The settlers, having arrived at Prospect Heights, went<br/>immediately towards that point of the lake near which was the old<br/>opening now uncovered. This outlet had now become practicable,<br/>since the water no longer rushed through it, and it would doubtless<br/>be easy to explore the interior.<br/><br/>In a few minutes the settlers had reached the lower point of the<br/>lake, and a glance showed them that the object had been<br/>attained.<br/><br/>In fact, in the side of the lake, and now above the surface of<br/>the water, appeared the long-looked-for opening. A narrow ridge,<br/>left bare by the retreat of the water, allowed them to approach it.<br/>This orifice was nearly twenty feet in width, but scarcely two in<br/>height. It was like the mouth of a drain at the edge of the<br/>pavement, and therefore did not offer an easy passage to the<br/>settlers; but Neb and Pencroft, taking their pickaxes, soon made it<br/>of a suitable height.<br/><br/>The engineer then approached, and found that the sides of the<br/>opening, in its upper part at least, had not a slope of more than<br/>from thirty to thirty-five degrees. It was therefore practicable,<br/>and, provided that the declivity did not increase, it would be easy<br/>to descend even to the level of the sea. If then, as was probable,<br/>some vast cavity existed in the interior of the granite, it might,<br/>perhaps, be of great use.<br/><br/>"Well, captain, what are we stopping for?" asked the sailor,<br/>impatient to enter the narrow passage. You see Top has got before<br/>us!"<br/><br/>"Very well," replied the engineer. "But we must see our way.<br/>Neb, go and cut some resinous branches."<br/>
