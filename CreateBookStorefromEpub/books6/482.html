"There it is!" said he.<br/><br/>This wire lay along the ground, and was surrounded with an<br/>isolating substance like a submarine cable, so as to assure the<br/>free transmission of the current. It appeared to pass through the<br/>wood and the southern spurs of the mountain, and consequently it<br/>ran towards the west.<br/><br/>"Follow it!" said Cyrus Harding.<br/><br/>And the settlers immediately pressed forward, guided by the<br/>wire.<br/><br/>The thunder continued to roar with such violence that not a word<br/>could be heard. However, there was no occasion for speaking, but to<br/>get forward as fast as possible.<br/><br/>Cyrus Harding and his companions then climbed the spur rising<br/>between the corral valley and that of Falls River, which they<br/>crossed at its narrowest part. The wire, sometimes stretched over<br/>the lower branches of the trees, sometimes lying on the ground,<br/>guided them surely. The engineer had supposed that the wire would<br/>perhaps stop at the bottom of the valley, and that the stranger's<br/>retreat would be there.<br/><br/>Nothing of the sort. They were obliged to ascend the<br/>south-western spur, and re-descend on that arid plateau terminated<br/>by the strangely-wild basalt cliff. From time to time one of the<br/>colonists stooped down and felt for the wire with his hands; but<br/>there was now no doubt that the wire was running directly towards<br/>the sea. There, to a certainty, in the depths of those rocks, was<br/>the dwelling so long sought for in vain.<br/><br/>The sky was literally on fire. Flash succeeded flash. Several<br/>struck the summit of the volcano in the midst of the thick smoke.<br/>It appeared there as if the mountain was vomiting flame. At a few<br/>minutes to eleven the colonists arrived on the high cliff<br/>overlooking the ocean to the west. The wind had risen. The surf<br/>roared 500 feet below.<br/><br/>Harding calculated that they had gone a mile and a half from the<br/>corral.<br/><br/>At this point the wire entered among the rocks, following the<br/>steep side of a narrow ravine. The settlers followed it at the risk<br/>of occasioning a fall of the slightly-balanced rocks, and being<br/>dashed into the sea. The descent was extremely perilous, but they<br/>did not think of the danger; they were no longer masters of<br/>themselves, and an irresistible attraction drew them towards this<br/>mysterious place as the magnet draws iron.<br/><br/>Thus they almost unconsciously descended this ravine, which even<br/>in broad daylight would have been considered impracticable.<br/>
