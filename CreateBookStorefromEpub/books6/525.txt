Hope revived in the hearts of the colonists, who had, in this
fourth year of their sojourn on Lincoln island, suffered so many
trials. Even Pencroft lost in some measure the somber taciturnity
occasioned by the devastation and ruin of his domain. His hopes, it
is true, were concentrated upon his vessel.

"We shall finish it," he said to the engineer, "we shall finish
it, captain, and it is time, for the season is advancing and the
equinox will soon be here. Well, if necessary, we must put in to
Tabor island to spend the winter. But think of Tabor island after
Lincoln Island. Ah, how unfortunate! Who could have believed it
possible?"

"Let us get on," was the engineer's invariable reply.

And they worked away without losing a moment.

"Master," asked Neb, a few days later, "do you think all this
could have happened if Captain Nemo had been still alive?"

"Certainly, Neb," answered Cyrus Harding.

"I, for one, don't believe it!" whispered Pencroft to Neb.

"Nor I!" answered Neb seriously.

During the first week of March appearances again became
menacing. Thousands of threads like glass, formed of fluid lava,
fell like rain upon the island. The crater was again boiling with
lava which overflowed the back of the volcano. The torrent flowed
along the surface of the hardened tufa, and destroyed the few
meager skeletons of trees which had withstood the first eruption.
The stream, flowing this time towards the southwest shore of Lake
Grant, stretched beyond Creek Glycerine, and invaded the plateau of
Prospect Heights. This last blow to the work of the colonists was
terrible. The mill, the buildings of the inner court, the stables,
were all destroyed. The affrighted poultry fled in all directions.
Top and Jup showed signs of the greatest alarm, as if their
instinct warned them of an impending catastrophe. A large number of
the animals of the island had perished in the first eruption. Those
which survived found no refuge but Tadorn Marsh, save a few to
which the plateau of Prospect Heights afforded asylum. But even
this last retreat was now closed to them, and the lava- torrent,
flowing over the edge of the granite wall, began to pour down upon
the beach its cataracts of fire. The sublime horror of this
spectacle passed all description. During the night it could only be
compared to a Niagara of molten fluid, with its incandescent vapors
above and its boiling masses below.

The colonists were driven to their last entrenchment, and
although the upper seams of the vessel were not yet calked, they
decided to launch her at once.

Pencroft and Ayrton therefore set about the necessary
preparations for the launching, which was to take place the morning
of the next day, the 9th of March.
