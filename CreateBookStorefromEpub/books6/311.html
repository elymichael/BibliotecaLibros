<br/>"And then," continued the sailor, "if the document was several<br/>years old, if it had been shut up in that bottle for several years,<br/>it would have been injured by damp. Now, there is nothing of the<br/>kind, and it was found in a perfect state of preservation."<br/><br/>The sailor's reasoning was very just, and pointed out an<br/>incomprehensible fact, for the document appeared to have been<br/>recently written, when the colonists found it in the bottle.<br/>Moreover, it gave the latitude and longitude of Tabor Island<br/>correctly, which implied that its author had a more complete<br/>knowledge of hydrography than could be expected of a common<br/>sailor.<br/><br/>"There is in this, again, something unaccountable," said the<br/>engineer, "but we will not urge our companions to speak. When he<br/>likes, my friends, then we shall be ready to hear him!"<br/><br/>During the following days the stranger did not speak a word, and<br/>did not once leave the precincts of the plateau. He worked away,<br/>without losing a moment, without taking a minute's rest, but always<br/>in a retired place. At meal times he never came to Granite House,<br/>although invited several times to do so, but contented himself with<br/>eating a few raw vegetables. At nightfall he did not return to the<br/>room assigned to him, but remained under some clump of trees, or<br/>when the weather was bad crouched in some cleft of the rocks. Thus<br/>he lived in the same manner as when he had no other shelter than<br/>the forests of Tabor Island, and as all persuasion to induce him to<br/>improve his life was in vain, the colonists waited patiently. And<br/>the time was near, when, as it seemed, almost involuntarily urged<br/>by his conscience, a terrible confession escaped him.<br/><br/>On the 10th of November, about eight o'clock in the evening, as<br/>night was coming on, the stranger appeared unexpectedly before the<br/>settlers, who were assembled under the veranda. His eyes burned<br/>strangely, and he had quite resumed the wild aspect of his worst<br/>days.<br/><br/>Cyrus Harding and his companions were astounded on seeing that,<br/>overcome by some terrible emotion, his teeth chattered like those<br/>of a person in a fever. What was the matter with him? Was the sight<br/>of his fellow-creatures insupportable to him? Was he weary of this<br/>return to a civilized mode of existence? Was he pining for his<br/>former savage life? It appeared so, as soon he was heard to express<br/>himself in these incoherent sentences:—<br/><br/>"Why am I here?… . By what right have you dragged me from my<br/>islet?… . Do you think there could be any tie between you and me?…<br/>. Do you know who I am—what I have done—why I was there—alone? And<br/>who told you that I was not abandoned there—that I was not<br/>condemned to die there?… . Do you know my past?… . How do you know<br/>that I have not stolen, murdered—that I am not a wretch—an accursed<br/>being—only fit to live like a wild beast, far from all—speak—do you<br/>know it?"<br/><br/>The colonists listened without interrupting the miserable<br/>creature, from whom these broken confessions escaped, as it were,<br/>in spite of himself. Harding wishing to calm him, approached him,<br/>but he hastily drew back.<br/><br/>"No! no!" he exclaimed; "one word only—am I free?"<br/><br/>"You are free," answered the engineer.<br/><br/>
