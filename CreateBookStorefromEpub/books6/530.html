"At Lincoln Island!" exclaimed in a breath Gideon Spilett,<br/>Herbert, Neb, and Pencroft, in the highest degree astonished.<br/><br/>"How could you be aware of the existence of Lincoln Island?"<br/>inquired Cyrus Harding, "it is not even named in the charts."<br/><br/>"I knew of it from a document left by you on Tabor Island,"<br/>answered Robert Grant.<br/><br/>"A document!" cried Gideon Spilett.<br/><br/>"Without doubt, and here it is," answered Robert Grant,<br/>producing a paper which indicated the longitude and latitude of<br/>Lincoln Island, "the present residence of Ayrton and five American<br/>colonists."<br/><br/>"It is Captain Nemo!" cried Cyrus Harding, after having read the<br/>notice, and recognized that the handwriting was similar to that of<br/>the paper found at the corral.<br/><br/>"Ah!" said Pencroft, "it was then he who took our 'Bonadventure'<br/>and hazarded himself alone to go to Tabor Island!"<br/><br/>"In order to leave this notice," added Herbert.<br/><br/>"I was then right in saying," exclaimed the sailor, "that even<br/>after his death the captain would render us a last service."<br/><br/>"My friends," said Cyrus Harding, in a voice of the profoundest<br/>emotion, "may the God of mercy have had pity on the soul of Captain<br/>Nemo, our benefactor."<br/><br/>The colonists uncovered themselves at these last words of Cyrus<br/>Harding, and murmured the name of Captain Nemo.<br/>
