<br/>"Why, Mr. Spilett," replied the sailor, "they would only have to<br/>start in the night with a good breeze, and they would be out of<br/>sight of the island in two hours."<br/><br/>"Well," resumed Gideon Spilett, "I ask again, what object could<br/>the convicts have had in using the 'Bonadventure,' and why, after<br/>they had made use of her, should they have brought her back to<br/>port?"<br/><br/>"Why, Mr. Spilett," replied the sailor, "we must put that among<br/>the unaccountable things, and not think anything more about it. The<br/>chief thing is that the 'Bonadventure' was there, and she is there<br/>now. Only, unfortunately, if the convicts take her a second time,<br/>we shall very likely not find her again in her place!"<br/><br/>"Then, Pencroft," said Herbert, "would it not be wisest to bring<br/>the 'Bonadventure' off to Granite House?"<br/><br/>"Yes and no," answered Pencroft, "or rather no. The mouth of the<br/>Mercy is a bad place for a vessel, and the sea is heavy there."<br/><br/>"But by hauling her up on the sand, to the foot of the<br/>Chimneys?"<br/><br/>"Perhaps yes," replied Pencroft. "At any rate, since we must<br/>leave Granite House for a long expedition, I think the<br/>'Bonadventure' will be safer here during our absence, and we shall<br/>do best to leave her here until the island is rid of these<br/>blackguards."<br/><br/>"That is exactly my opinion," said the reporter. "At any rate in<br/>the event of bad weather, she will not be exposed here as she would<br/>be at the mouth of the Mercy."<br/><br/>"But suppose the convicts pay her another visit," said<br/>Herbert.<br/><br/>"Well, my boy," replied Pencroft, "not finding her here, they<br/>would not be long in finding her on the sands of Granite House,<br/>and, during our absence, nothing could hinder them from seizing<br/>her! I agree, therefore, with Mr. Spilett, that she must be left in<br/>Port Balloon. But, if on our return we have not rid the island of<br/>those rascals, it will be prudent to bring our boat to Granite<br/>House, until the time when we need not fear any unpleasant<br/>visits."<br/><br/>
