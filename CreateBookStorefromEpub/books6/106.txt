"You see, captain, so long as we have not one or two
fowling-pieces, we shall never get anything!"

"Doubtless, Pencroft," replied the reporter, "but it depends on
you. Procure us some iron for the barrels, steel for the hammers,
saltpeter. coal and sulphur for powder, mercury and nitric acid for
the fulminate, and lead for the shot, and the captain will make us
first-rate guns."

"Oh!" replied the engineer, "we might, no doubt, find all these
substances on the island, but a gun is a delicate instrument, and
needs very particular tools. However, we shall see later!"

"Why," cried Pencroft, "were we obliged to throw overboard all
the weapons we had with us in the car, all our implements, even our
pocket- knives?"

"But if we had not thrown them away, Pencroft, the balloon would
have thrown us to the bottom of the sea!" said Herbert.

"What you say is true, my boy," replied the sailor.

Then passing to another idea,â€”"Think," said he, "how astounded
Jonathan Forster and his companions must have been when, next
morning, they found the place empty, and the machine flown
away!"

"I am utterly indifferent about knowing what they may have
thought," said the reporter.

"It was all my idea, that!" said Pencroft, with a satisfied
air.

"A splendid idea, Pencroft!" replied Gideon Spilett, laughing,
"and which has placed us where we are."
