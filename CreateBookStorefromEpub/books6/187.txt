The next day, the 30th of October, all was ready for the
proposed exploring expedition, which recent events had rendered so
necessary. In fact, things had so come about that the settlers in
Lincoln Island no longer needed help for themselves, but were even
able to carry it to others.

It was therefore agreed that they should ascend the Mercy as far
as the river was navigable. A great part of the distance would thus
be traversed without fatigue, and the explorers could transport
their provisions and arms to an advanced point in the west of the
island.

It was necessary to think not only of the things which they
should take with them, but also of those which they might have by
chance to bring back to Granite House. If there had been a wreck on
the coast, as was supposed, there would be many things cast up,
which would be lawfully their prizes. In the event of this, the
cart would have been of more use than the light canoe, but it was
heavy and clumsy to drag, and therefore more difficult to use; this
led Pencroft to express his regret that the chest had not
contained, besides "his halfpound of tobacco," a pair of strong New
Jersey horses, which would have been very useful to the colony!

The provisions, which Neb had already packed up, consisted of a
store of meat and of several gallons of beer, that is to say enough
to sustain them for three days, the time which Harding assigned for
the expedition. They hoped besides to supply themselves on the
road, and Neb took care not to forget the portable stove.

The only tools the settlers took were the two woodmen's axes,
which they could use to cut a path through the thick forests, as
also the instruments, the telescope and pocket-compass.

For weapons they selected the two flint-lock guns, which were
likely to be more useful to them than the percussion
fowling-pieces, the first only requiring flints which could be
easily replaced, and the latter needing fulminating caps, a
frequent use of which would soon exhaust their limited stock.
However, they took also one of the carbines and some cartridges. As
to the powder, of which there was about fifty pounds in the barrel,
a small supply of it had to be taken, but the engineer hoped to
manufacture an explosive substance which would allow them to
husband it. To the firearms were added the five cutlasses well
sheathed in leather, and, thus supplied, the settlers could venture
into the vast forest with some chance of success.
