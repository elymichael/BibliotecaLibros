However, the mystery which enveloped its strange destruction
would doubtless never have been cleared away if, on the 30th of
November, Neb, strolling on the beach, had not found a piece of a
thick iron cylinder, bearing traces of explosion. The edges of this
cylinder were twisted and broken, as if they had been subjected to
the action of some explosive substance.

Neb brought this piece of metal to his master, who was then
occupied with his companions in the workshop of the Chimneys.

Cyrus Harding examined the cylinder attentively, then, turning
to Pencroft,â€”

"You persist, my friend," said he, "in maintaining that the
'Speedy' was not lost in consequence of a collision?"

"Yes, captain," answered the sailor. "You know as well as I do
that there are no rocks in the channel."

"But suppose she had run against this piece of iron?" said the
engineer, showing the broken cylinder.

"What, that bit of pipe!" exclaimed Pencroft in a tone of
perfect incredulity.

"My friends," resumed Harding, "you remember that before she
foundered the brig rose on the summit of a regular waterspout?"

"Yes, captain," replied Herbert.

"Well, would you like to know what occasioned that waterspout?
It was this," said the engineer, holding up the broken tube.
