"Shall we leave the cart in the wood?" asked Neb.<br/><br/>"No," replied the engineer, "it is our wagon of ammunition and<br/>provisions, and, if necessary, it would serve as an<br/>entrenchment."<br/><br/>"Forward, then!" said Gideon Spilett.<br/><br/>The cart emerged from the wood and began to roll noiselessly<br/>towards the palisade. The darkness was now profound, the silence as<br/>complete as when Pencroft and the reporter crept over the ground.<br/>The thick grass completely muffled their footsteps. The colonists<br/>held themselves ready to fire. Jup, at Pencroft's orders, kept<br/>behind.
