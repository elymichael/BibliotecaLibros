To the enormous lava rocks succeeded soon those capricious sand
dunes, among which the engineer had been so singularly recovered,
and which seabirds frequented in thousands.

About four o'clock, Pencroft leaving the point of the islet on
his left, entered the channel which separated it from the coast,
and at five o'clock the anchor of the "Bonadventure" was buried in
the sand at the mouth of the Mercy.

The colonists had been absent three days from their dwelling.
Ayrton was waiting for them on the beach, and Jup came joyously to
meet them, giving vent to deep grunts of satisfaction.

A complete exploration of the coast of the island had now been
made, and no suspicious appearances had been observed. If any
mysterious being resided on it, it could only be under cover of the
impenetrable forest of the Serpentine Peninsula, to which the
colonists had not yet directed their investigations.

Gideon Spilett discussed these things with the engineer, and it
was agreed that they should direct the attention of their
companions to the strange character of certain incidents which had
occurred on the island, and of which the last was the most
unaccountable.

However, Harding, returning to the fact of a fire having been
kindled on the shore by an unknown hand, could not refrain from
repeating for the twentieth time to the reporter,—

"But are you quite sure of having seen it? Was it not a partial
eruption of the volcano, or perhaps some meteor?"

"No, Cyrus," answered the reporter, "it was certainly a fire
lighted by the hand of man. Besides; question Pencroft and Herbert.
They saw it as I saw it myself, and they will confirm my
words."

In consequence, therefore, a few days after, on the 25th of
April, in the evening, when the settlers were all collected on
Prospect Heights, Cyrus Harding began by saying,—

"My friends, I think it my duty to call your attention to
certain incidents which have occurred in the island, on the subject
of which I shall be happy to have your advice. These incidents are,
so to speak, supernatural—"

"Supernatural!" exclaimed the sailor, emitting a volume of smoke
from his mouth. "Can it be possible that our island is
supernatural?"
