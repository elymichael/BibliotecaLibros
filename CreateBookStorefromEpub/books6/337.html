"And in which we might go to the Pomoutous," added Herbert,<br/>"just as easily as we went to Tabor Island."<br/><br/>"I do not say no," replied Pencroft, who had always the casting<br/>vote in maritime questions; "I do not say no, although it is not<br/>exactly the same thing to make a long as a short voyage! If our<br/>little craft had been caught in any heavy gale of wind during the<br/>voyage to Tabor Island, we should have known that land was at no<br/>great distance either way; but twelve hundred miles is a pretty<br/>long way, and the nearest land is at least that distance!"<br/><br/>"Would you not, in that case, Pencroft, attempt the adventure?"<br/>asked the reporter.<br/><br/>"I will attempt anything that is desired, Mr. Spilett," answered<br/>the sailor, "and you know well that I am not a man to flinch!"<br/><br/>"Remember, besides, that we number another sailor amongst us<br/>now," remarked Neb.<br/><br/>"Who is that?" asked Pencroft.<br/><br/>"Ayrton."<br/><br/>"If he will consent to come," said Pencroft.<br/><br/>"Nonsense!" returned the reporter; "do you think that if Lord<br/>Glenarvan's yacht had appeared at Tabor Island, while he was still<br/>living there, Ayrton would have refused to depart?"<br/><br/>"You forget, my friends," then said Cyrus Harding, "that Ayrton<br/>was not in possession of his reason during the last years of his<br/>stay there. But that is not the question. The point is to know if<br/>we may count among our chances of being rescued, the return of the<br/>Scotch vessel. Now, Lord Glenarvan promised Ayrton that he would<br/>return to take him off from Tabor Island when he considered that<br/>his crimes were expiated, and I believe that he will return."<br/><br/>"Yes," said the reporter, "and I will add that he will return<br/>soon, for it is twelve years since Ayrton was abandoned."<br/>
