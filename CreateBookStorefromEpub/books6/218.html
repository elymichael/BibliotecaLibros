The settlers asked if Granite House was inhabited or not, and<br/>yet the position of the ladder was sufficient to show that it was;<br/>it was also certain that the inhabitants, whoever they might be,<br/>had not been able to escape. But how were they to be got at?<br/><br/>Herbert then thought of fastening a cord to an arrow, and<br/>shooting the arrow so that it should pass between the first rounds<br/>of the ladder which hung from the threshold. By means of the cord<br/>they would then be able to draw down the ladder to the ground, and<br/>so re-establish the communication between the beach and Granite<br/>House. There was evidently nothing else to be done, and, with a<br/>little skill, this method might succeed. Very fortunately bows and<br/>arrows had been left at the Chimneys, where they also found a<br/>quantity of light hibiscus cord. Pencroft fastened this to a<br/>well-feathered arrow. Then Herbert fixing it to his bow, took a<br/>careful aim for the lower part of the ladder.<br/><br/>Cyrus Harding, Gideon Spilett, Pencroft, and Neb drew back, so<br/>as to see if anything appeared at the windows. The reporter lifted<br/>his gun to his shoulder and covered the door.<br/><br/>The bow was bent, the arrow flew, taking the cord with it, and<br/>passed between the two last rounds.<br/><br/>The operation had succeeded.<br/><br/>Herbert immediately seized the end of the cord, but, at that<br/>moment when he gave it a pull to bring down the ladder, an arm,<br/>thrust suddenly out between the wall and the door, grasped it and<br/>dragged it inside Granite House.<br/><br/>"The rascals!" shouted the sailor. "If a ball can do anything<br/>for you, you shall not have long to wait for it.<br/><br/>"But who was it?" asked Neb.<br/><br/>"Who was it? Didn't you see?"<br/><br/>"No."<br/><br/>"It was a monkey, a sapajou, an orangoutang, a baboon, a<br/>gorilla, a sagoin. Our dwelling has been invaded by monkeys, who<br/>climbed up the ladder during our absence."<br/>
