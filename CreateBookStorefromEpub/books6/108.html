<br/>"Well then," cried the sailor, "I am quite ready to be<br/>captain—as soon as you can make a craft that's able to keep at<br/>sea!"<br/><br/>"We shall do it, if it is necessary," replied Cyrus Harding.<br/><br/>But while these men, who really hesitated at nothing, were<br/>talking, the hour approached at which the observation was to be<br/>made. What Cyrus Harding was to do to ascertain the passage of the<br/>sun at the meridian of the island, without an instrument of any<br/>sort, Herbert could not guess.<br/><br/>The observers were then about six miles from the Chimneys, not<br/>far from that part of the downs in which the engineer had been<br/>found after his enigmatical preservation. They halted at this place<br/>and prepared for breakfast, for it was half-past eleven. Herbert<br/>went for some fresh water from a stream which ran near, and brought<br/>it back in a jug, which Neb had provided.<br/><br/>During these preparations Harding arranged everything for his<br/>astronomical observation. He chose a clear place on the shore,<br/>which the ebbing tide had left perfectly level. This bed of fine<br/>sand was as smooth as ice, not a grain out of place. It was of<br/>little importance whether it was horizontal or not, and it did not<br/>matter much whether the stick six feet high, which was planted<br/>there, rose perpendicularly. On the contrary, the engineer inclined<br/>it towards the south, that is to say, in the direction of the coast<br/>opposite to the sun, for it must not be forgotten that the settlers<br/>in Lincoln Island, as the island was situated in the Southern<br/>Hemisphere, saw the radiant planet describe its diurnal arc above<br/>the northern, and not above the southern horizon.<br/><br/>Herbert now understood how the engineer was going to proceed to<br/>ascertain the culmination of the sun, that is to say its passing<br/>the meridian of the island or, in other words, determine due south.<br/>It was by means of the shadow cast on the sand by the stick, a way<br/>which, for want of an instrument, would give him a suitable<br/>approach to the result which he wished to obtain.<br/><br/>In fact, the moment when this shadow would reach its minimum of<br/>length would be exactly twelve o'clock, and it would be enough to<br/>watch the extremity of the shadow, so as to ascertain the instant<br/>when, alter having successively diminished, it began to lengthen.<br/>By inclining his stick to the side opposite to the sun, Cyrus<br/>Harding made the shadow longer, and consequently its modifications<br/>would be more easily ascertained. In fact, the longer the needle of<br/>a dial is, the more easily can the movement of its point be<br/>followed. The shadow of the stick was nothing but the needle of a<br/>dial. The moment had come, and Cyrus Harding knelt on the sand, and<br/>with little wooden pegs, which he stuck into the sand, he began to<br/>mark the successive diminutions of the stick's shadow. His<br/>companions, bending over him, watched the operation with extreme<br/>interest. The reporter held his chronometer in his hand, ready to<br/>tell the hour which it marked when the shadow would be at its<br/>shortest. Moreover, as Cyrus Harding was working on the 16th of<br/>April, the day on which the true and the average time are<br/>identical, the hour given by Gideon Spilett would be the true hour<br/>then at Washington, which would simplify the calculation. Meanwhile<br/>as the sun slowly advanced, the shadow slowly diminished, and when<br/>it appeared to Cyrus Harding that it was beginning to increase, he<br/>asked, "What o'clock is it?"<br/><br/>"One minute past five," replied Gideon Spilett directly. They<br/>had now only to calculate the operation. Nothing could be easier.<br/>It could be seen that there existed, in round numbers, a difference<br/>of five hours between the meridian of Washington and that of<br/>Lincoln Island, that is to say, it was midday in Lincoln Island<br/>when it was already five o'clock in the evening in Washington. Now<br/>the sun, in its apparent movement round the earth, traverses one<br/>degree in four minutes, or fifteen degrees an hour. Fifteen degrees<br/>multiplied by five hours give seventy-five degrees.<br/><br/>Then, since Washington is 77deg 3' 11" as much as to say<br/>seventy-seven degrees counted from the meridian of Greenwich which<br/>the Americans take for their starting-point for longitudes<br/>concurrently with the English—it followed that the island must be<br/>situated seventy-seven and seventy-five degrees west of the<br/>meridian of Greenwich, that is to say, on the hundred and<br/>fifty-second degree of west longitude.<br/><br/>Cyrus Harding announced this result to his companions, and<br/>taking into consideration errors of observation, as he had done for<br/>the latitude, he believed he could positively affirm that the<br/>position of Lincoln Island was between the thirty-fifth and the<br/>thirty-seventh parallel, and between the hundred and fiftieth and<br/>the hundred and fifty-fifth meridian to the west of the meridian of<br/>Greenwich.<br/><br/>
