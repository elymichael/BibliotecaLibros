<br/>The lad was not joking in saying this, for he knew how this<br/>intelligent race could be turned to account.<br/><br/>The settlers then approached the ape and gazed at it<br/>attentively. He belonged to the family of anthropoid apes, of which<br/>the facial angle is not much inferior to that of the Australians<br/>and Hottentots. It was an orangoutang, and as such, had neither the<br/>ferocity of the gorilla, nor the stupidity of the baboon. It is to<br/>this family of the anthropoid apes that so many characteristics<br/>belong which prove them to be possessed of an almost human<br/>intelligence. Employed in houses, they can wait at table, sweep<br/>rooms, brush clothes, clean boots, handle a knife, fork, and spoon<br/>properly, and even drink wine&#160;… doing everything as well as<br/>the best servant that ever walked upon two legs. Buffon possessed<br/>one of these apes, who served him for a long time as a faithful and<br/>zealous servant.<br/><br/>The one which had been seized in the hall of Granite House was a<br/>great fellow, six feet high, with an admirably poportioned frame, a<br/>broad chest, head of a moderate size, the facial angle reaching<br/>sixty-five degrees, round skull, projecting nose, skin covered with<br/>soft glossy hair, in short, a fine specimen of the anthropoids. His<br/>eyes, rather smaller than human eyes, sparkled with intelligence;<br/>his white teeth glittered under his mustache, and he wore a little<br/>curly brown beard.<br/><br/>"A handsome fellow!" said Pencroft; "if we only knew his<br/>language, we could talk to him."<br/><br/>"But, master," said Neb, "are you serious? Are we going to take<br/>him as a servant?"<br/><br/>"Yes, Neb," replied the engineer, smiling. "But you must not be<br/>jealous."<br/><br/>"And I hope he will make an excellent servant," added Herbert.<br/>"He appears young, and will be easy to educate, and we shall not be<br/>obliged to use force to subdue him, nor draw his teeth, as is<br/>sometimes done. He will soon grow fond of his masters if they are<br/>kind to him."<br/><br/>"And they will be," replied Pencroft, who had forgotten all his<br/>rancor against "the jokers."<br/><br/>Then, approaching the orang,—<br/><br/>"Well, old boy!" he asked, "how are you?"<br/><br/>
