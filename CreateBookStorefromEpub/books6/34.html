<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>6<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>The inventory of the articles possessed by these castaways from<br/>the clouds, thrown upon a coast which appeared to be uninhabited,<br/>was soon made out. They had nothing, save the clothes which they<br/>were wearing at the time of the catastrophe. We must mention,<br/>however, a note-book and a watch which Gideon Spilett had kept,<br/>doubtless by inadvertence, not a weapon, not a tool, not even a<br/>pocket-knife; for while in the car they had thrown out everything<br/>to lighten the balloon. The imaginary heroes of Daniel Defoe or of<br/>Wyss, as well as Selkirk and Raynal shipwrecked on Juan Fernandez<br/>and on the archipelago of the Aucklands, were never in such<br/>absolute destitution. Either they had abundant resources from their<br/>stranded vessels, in grain, cattle, tools, ammunition, or else some<br/>things were thrown up on the coast which supplied them with all the<br/>first necessities of life. But here, not any instrument whatever,<br/>not a utensil. From nothing they must supply themselves with<br/>everything.<br/><br/>And yet, if Cyrus Harding had been with them, if the engineer<br/>could have brought his practical science, his inventive mind to<br/>bear on their situation, perhaps all hope would not have been lost.<br/>Alas! they must hope no longer again to see Cyrus Harding. The<br/>castaways could expect nothing but from themselves and from that<br/>Providence which never abandons those whose faith is sincere.<br/><br/>But ought they to establish themselves on this part of the<br/>coast, without trying to know to what continent it belonged, if it<br/>was inhabited, or if they were on the shore of a desert island?<br/><br/>It was an important question, and should be solved with the<br/>shortest possible delay. From its answer they would know what<br/>measures to take. However, according to Pencroft's advice, it<br/>appeared best to wait a few days before commencing an exploration.<br/>They must, in fact, prepare some provisions and procure more<br/>strengthening food than eggs and molluscs. The explorers, before<br/>undertaking new fatigues, must first of all recruit their<br/>strength.<br/><br/>The Chimneys offered a retreat sufficient for the present. The<br/>fire was lighted, and it was easy to preserve some embers. There<br/>were plenty of shell-fish and eggs among the rocks and on the<br/>beach. It would be easy to kill a few of the pigeons which were<br/>flying by hundreds about the summit of the plateau, either with<br/>sticks or stones. Perhaps the trees of the neighboring forest would<br/>supply them with eatable fruit. Lastly, the sweet water was<br/>there.<br/><br/>It was accordingly settled that for a few days they would remain<br/>at the Chimneys so as to prepare themselves for an expedition,<br/>either along the shore or into the interior of the country. This<br/>plan suited Neb particularly. As obstinate in his ideas as in his<br/>presentiments, he was in no haste to abandon this part of the<br/>coast, the scene of the catastrophe. He did not, he would not<br/>believe in the loss of Cyrus Harding. No, it did not seem to him<br/>possible that such a man had ended in this vulgar fashion, carried<br/>away by a wave, drowned in the floods, a few hundred feet from a<br/>shore. As long as the waves had not cast up the body of the<br/>engineer, as long as he, Neb, had not seen with his eyes, touched<br/>with his hands the corpse of his master, he would not believe in<br/>his death! And this idea rooted itself deeper than ever in his<br/>determined heart. An illusion perhaps, but still an illusion to be<br/>respected, and one which the sailor did not wish to destroy. As for<br/>him, he hoped no longer, but there was no use in arguing with Neb.<br/>He was like the dog who will not leave the place where his master<br/>is buried, and his grief was such that most probably he would not<br/>survive him.<br/><br/>
