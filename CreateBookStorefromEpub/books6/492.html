The engineer was silent.<br/><br/>"Well, sir?"<br/><br/>"It is not for me to judge you, Captain Nemo," answered Cyrus<br/>Harding, "at any rate as regards your past life. I am, with the<br/>rest of the world, ignorant of the motives which induced you to<br/>adopt this strange mode of existence, and I cannot judge of effects<br/>without knowing their causes; but what I do know is, that a<br/>beneficent hand has constantly protected us since our arrival on<br/>Lincoln Island, that we all owe our lives to a good, generous, and<br/>powerful being, and that this being so powerful, good and generous,<br/>Captain Nemo, is yourself!"<br/><br/>"It is I," answered the captain simply.<br/><br/>The engineer and the reporter rose. Their companions had drawn<br/>near, and the gratitude with which their hearts were charged was<br/>about to express itself in their gestures and words.<br/><br/>Captain Nemo stopped them by a sign, and in a voice which<br/>betrayed more emotion than he doubtless intended to show.<br/><br/>"Wait till you have heard all," he said.<br/><br/>And the captain, in a few concise sentences, ran over the events<br/>of his life.<br/><br/>His narrative was short, yet he was obliged to summon up his<br/>whole remaining energy to arrive at the end. He was evidently<br/>contending against extreme weakness. Several times Cyrus Harding<br/>entreated him to repose for a while, but he shook his head as a man<br/>to whom the morrow may never come, and when the reporter offered<br/>his assistance,â€”<br/><br/>"It is useless," he said; "my hours are numbered."<br/><br/>Captain Nemo was an Indian, the Prince Dakkar, son of a rajah of<br/>the then independent territory of Bundelkund. His father sent him,<br/>when ten years of age, to Europe, in order that he might receive an<br/>education in all respects complete, and in the hopes that by his<br/>talents and knowledge he might one day take a leading part in<br/>raising his long degraded and heathen country to a level with the<br/>nations of Europe.<br/>
