The next day, the 20th of October, at seven o'clock in the
morning, after a voyage of four days, the "Bonadventure" gently
glided up to the beach at the mouth of the Mercy.

Cyrus Harding and Neb, who had become very uneasy at the bad
weather and the prolonged absence of their companions, had climbed
at daybreak to the plateau of Prospect Heights, and they had at
last caught sight of the vessel which had been so long in
returning.

"God be praised! there they are!" exclaimed Cyrus Harding.

As to Neb in his joy, he began to dance, to twirl round,
clapping his hands and shouting, "Oh! my master!" A more touching
pantomime than the finest discourse.

The engineer's first idea, on counting the people on the deck of
the "Bonadventure," was that Pencroft had not found the castaway of
Tabor Island, or at any rate that the unfortunate man had refused
to leave his island and change one prison for another.

Indeed Pencroft, Gideon Spilett, and Herbert were alone on the
deck of the "Bonadventure."
