The sailor had at first lighted a fire in the hut, which was not<br/>wanting in things necessary for life. Maple sugar, medicinal<br/>plants, the same which the lad had gathered on the banks of Lake<br/>Grant, enabled them to make some refreshing drinks, which they gave<br/>him without his taking any notice of it. His fever was extremely<br/>high, and all that day and night passed without his becoming<br/>conscious.<br/><br/>Herbert's life hung on a thread, and this thread might break at<br/>any moment. The next day, the 12th of November, the hopes of<br/>Harding and his companions slightly revived. Herbert had come out<br/>of his long stupor. He opened his eyes, he recognized Cyrus<br/>Harding, the reporter, and Pencroft. He uttered two or three words.<br/>He did not know what had happened. They told him, and Spilett<br/>begged him to remain perfectly still, telling him that his life was<br/>not in danger, and that his wounds would heal in a few days.<br/>However, Herbert scarcely suffered at all, and the cold water with<br/>which they were constantly bathed, prevented any inflammation of<br/>the wounds. The suppuration was established in a regular way, the<br/>fever did not increase, and it might now be hoped that this<br/>terrible wound would not involve any catastrophe. Pencroft felt the<br/>swelling of his heart gradually subside. He was like a sister of<br/>mercy. like a mother by the bed of her child.<br/><br/>Herbert dozed again, but his sleep appeared more natural.<br/><br/>"Tell me again that you hope, Mr. Spilett," said Pencroft. "Tell<br/>me again that you will save Herbert!"<br/><br/>"Yes, we will save him!" replied the reporter. "The wound is<br/>serious, and, perhaps, even the ball has traversed the lungs, but<br/>the perforation of this organ is not fatal."<br/><br/>"God bless you!" answered Pencroft.<br/><br/>As may be believed, during the four-and-twenty hours they had<br/>been in the corral, the colonists had no other thought than that of<br/>nursing Herbert. They did not think either of the danger which<br/>threatened them should the convicts return, or of the precautions<br/>to be taken for the future.<br/><br/>But on this day, while Pencroft watched by the sick-bed, Cyrus<br/>Harding and the reporter consulted as to what it would be best to<br/>do.<br/><br/>First of all they examined the corral. There was not a trace of<br/>Ayrton. Had the unhappy man been dragged away by his former<br/>accomplices? Had he resisted, and been overcome in the struggle?<br/>This last supposition was only too probable. Gideon Spilett, at the<br/>moment he scaled the palisade, had clearly seen some one of the<br/>convicts running along the southern spur of Mount Franklin, towards<br/>whom Top had sprung. It was one of those whose object had been so<br/>completely defeated by the rocks at the mouth of the Mercy.<br/>Besides, the one killed by Harding, and whose body was found<br/>outside the enclosure, of course belonged to Bob Harvey's crew.<br/><br/>As to the corral, it had not suffered any damage. The gates were<br/>closed, and the animals had not been able to disperse in the<br/>forest. Nor could they see traces of any struggle, any devastation,<br/>either in the hut, or in the palisade. The ammunition only, with<br/>which Ayrton had been supplied, had disappeared with him.<br/><br/>"The unhappy man has been surprised," said Harding, "and as he<br/>was a man to defend himself, he must have been overpowered."<br/>
