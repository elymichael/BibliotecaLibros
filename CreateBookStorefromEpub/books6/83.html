<br/>"I should prefer borrowing names from our country," said the<br/>reporter, "which would remind us of America."<br/><br/>"Yes, for the principal ones," then said Cyrus Harding; "for<br/>those of the bays and seas, I admit it willingly. We might give to<br/>that vast bay on the east the name of Union Bay, for example; to<br/>that large hollow on the south, Washington Bay; to the mountain<br/>upon which we are standing, that of Mount Franklin; to that lake<br/>which is extended under our eyes, that of Lake Grant; nothing could<br/>be better, my friends. These names will recall our country, and<br/>those of the great citizens who have honored it; but for the<br/>rivers, gulfs, capes, and promontories, which we perceive from the<br/>top of this mountain, rather let us choose names which will recall<br/>their particular shape. They will impress themselves better on our<br/>memory, and at the same time will be more practical. The shape of<br/>the island is so strange that we shall not be troubled to imagine<br/>what it resembles. As to the streams which we do not know as yet,<br/>in different parts of the forest which we shall explore later, the<br/>creeks which afterwards will he discovered, we can christen them as<br/>we find them. What do you think, my friends?"<br/><br/>The engineer's proposal was unanimously agreed to by his<br/>companions. The island was spread out under their eyes like a map,<br/>and they had only to give names to all its angles and points.<br/>Gideon Spilett would write them down, and the geographical<br/>nomenclature of the island would be definitely adopted. First, they<br/>named the two bays and the mountain, Union Bay, Washington Bay, and<br/>Mount Franklin, as the engineer had suggested.<br/><br/>"Now," said the reporter, "to this peninsula at the southwest of<br/>the island, I propose to give the name of Serpentine Peninsula, and<br/>that of Reptile-end to the bent tail which terminates it, for it is<br/>just like a reptile's tail."<br/><br/>"Adopted," said the engineer.<br/><br/>"Now," said Herbert, pointing to the other extremity of the<br/>island, "let us call this gulf which is so singularly like a pair<br/>of open jaws, Shark Gulf."<br/><br/>"Capital!" cried Pencroft, "and we can complete the resemblance<br/>by naming the two parts of the jaws Mandible Cape."<br/><br/>"But there are two capes," observed the reporter.<br/><br/>"Well," replied Pencroft, "we can have North Mandible Cape and<br/>South Mandible Cape."<br/><br/>"They are inscribed," said Spilett.<br/><br/>
