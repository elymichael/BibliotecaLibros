In the evening the crescent moon, which would not be in its<br/>first quarter until the 16th, appeared in the twilight and soon set<br/>again. The night was dark but starry, and the next day again<br/>promised to be fine.<br/><br/>Pencroft prudently lowered the foresail, not wishing to be<br/>caught by a sudden gust while carrying too much canvas; it was<br/>perhaps an unnecessary precaution on such a calm night, but<br/>Pencroft was a prudent sailor and cannot be blamed for it.<br/><br/>The reporter slept part of the night. Pencroft and Herbert took<br/>turns for a spell of two hours each at the helm. The sailor trusted<br/>Herbert as he would himself, and his confidence was justified by<br/>the coolness and judgment of the lad. Pencroft gave him his<br/>directions as a commander to his steersman, and Herbert never<br/>allowed the "Bonadventure" to swerve even a point. The night passed<br/>quickly, as did the day of the 12th of October. A south-easterly<br/>direction was strictly maintained. Unless the "Bonadventure" fell<br/>in with some unknown current she would come exactly within sight of<br/>Tabor Island.<br/><br/>As to the sea over which the vessel was then sailing, it was<br/>absolutely deserted. Now and then a great albatross or frigate bird<br/>passed within gunshot, and Gideon Spilett wondered if it was to one<br/>of them that he had confided his last letter addressed to the New<br/>York Herald. These birds were the only beings that appeared to<br/>frequent this part of the ocean between Tabor and Lincoln<br/>Islands.<br/><br/>"And yet," observed Herbert, "this is the time that whalers<br/>usually proceed towards the southern part of the Pacific. Indeed I<br/>do not think there could be a more deserted sea than this."<br/><br/>"It is not quite so deserted as all that," replied Pencroft.<br/><br/>"What do you mean?" asked the reporter.<br/><br/>"We are on it. Do you take our vessel for a wreck and us for<br/>porpoises?"<br/><br/>And Pencroft laughed at his joke.<br/><br/>By the evening, according to calculation, it was thought that<br/>the "Bonadventure" had accomplished a distance of a hundred and<br/>twenty miles since her departure from Lincoln Island, that is to<br/>say in thirty-six hours, which would give her a speed of between<br/>three and four knots an hour. The breeze was very slight and might<br/>soon drop altogether. However, it was hoped that the next morning<br/>by break of day, if the calculation had been correct and the course<br/>true, they would sight Tabor Island.<br/><br/>Neither Gideon Spilett, Herbert, nor Pencroft slept that night.<br/>In the expectation of the next day they could not but feel some<br/>emotion. There was so much uncertainty in their enterprise! Were<br/>they near Tabor Island? Was the island still inhabited by the<br/>castaway to whose succor they had come? Who was this man? Would not<br/>his presence disturb the little colony till then so united?<br/>Besides, would he be content to exchange his prison for another?<br/>All these questions, which would no doubt be answered the next day,<br/>kept them in suspense, and at the dawn of day they all fixed their<br/>gaze on the western horizon.<br/>
