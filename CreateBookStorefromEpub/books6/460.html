But from that moment Ayrton was exposed to the importunities of<br/>his former accomplices. They wished him to join them again, and<br/>relied upon his aid to enable them to gain possession of Granite<br/>House, to penetrate into that hitherto inaccessible dwelling, and<br/>to become masters of the island, after murdering the colonists!<br/><br/>Ayrton remained firm. The once convict, now repentant and<br/>pardoned, would rather die than betray his companions.<br/>Ayrton—bound, gagged, and closely watched—lived in this cave for<br/>four months.<br/><br/>Nevertheless the convicts had discovered the corral a short time<br/>after their arrival in the island, and since then they had<br/>subsisted on Ayrton's stores, but did not live at the corral.<br/><br/>On the 11th of November, two of the villains, surprised by the<br/>colonists' arrival, fired at Herbert, and one of them returned,<br/>boasting of having killed one of the inhabitants of the island; but<br/>he returned alone. His companion, as is known, fell by Cyrus<br/>Harding's dagger.<br/><br/>Ayrton's anxiety and despair may be imagined when he learned the<br/>news of Herbert's death. The settlers were now only four, and, as<br/>it seemed, at the mercy of the convicts. After this event, and<br/>during all the time that the colonists, detained by Herbert's<br/>illness, remained in the corral, the pirates did not leave their<br/>cavern, and even after they had pillaged the plateau of Prospect<br/>Heights, they did not think it prudent to abandon it.<br/><br/>The ill-treatment inflicted on Ayrton was now redoubled. His<br/>hands and feet still bore the bloody marks of the cords which bound<br/>him day and night. Every moment he expected to be put to death, nor<br/>did it appear possible that he could escape.<br/><br/>Matters remained thus until the third week of February. The<br/>convicts, still watching for a favorable opportunity, rarely<br/>quitted their retreat, and only made a few hunting excursions,<br/>either to the interior of the island, or the south coast.<br/><br/>Ayrton had no further news of his friends, and relinquished all<br/>hope of ever seeing them again. At last, the unfortunate man,<br/>weakened by ill- treatment, fell into a prostration so profound<br/>that sight and hearing failed him. From that moment, that is to<br/>say, since the last two days, he could give no information whatever<br/>of what had occurred.<br/><br/>"But, Captain Harding," he added, "since I was imprisoned in<br/>that cavern, how is it that I find myself in the corral?"<br/><br/>"How is it that the convicts are lying yonder dead, in the<br/>middle of the enclosure?" answered the engineer.<br/><br/>"Dead!" cried Ayrton, half rising from his bed, notwithstanding<br/>his weakness.<br/>
