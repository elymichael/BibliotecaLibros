They once more set out. The tide began to rise, and urged by the<br/>wind it threatened to be unusually high, as it was a spring tide.<br/>Great billows thundered against the reef with such violence that<br/>they probably passed entirely over the islet, then quite invisible.<br/>The mole no longer protected the coast, which was directly exposed<br/>to the attacks of the open sea.<br/><br/>As soon as the sailor and his companions left the precipice, the<br/>wind struck them again with renewed fury. Though bent under the<br/>gale they walked very quickly, following Top, who did not hesitate<br/>as to what direction to take.<br/><br/>They ascended towards the north, having on their left an<br/>interminable extent of billows, which broke with a deafening noise,<br/>and on their right a dark country, the aspect of which it was<br/>impossible to guess. But they felt that it was comparatively flat,<br/>for the wind passed completely over them, without being driven back<br/>as it was when it came in contact with the cliff.<br/><br/>At four o'clock in the morning, they reckoned that they had<br/>cleared about five miles. The clouds were slightly raised, and the<br/>wind, though less damp, was very sharp and cold. Insufficiently<br/>protected by their clothing, Pencroft, Herbert and Spilett suffered<br/>cruelly, but not a complaint escaped their lips. They were<br/>determined to follow Top, wherever the intelligent animal wished to<br/>lead them.<br/><br/>Towards five o'clock day began to break. At the zenith, where<br/>the fog was less thick, gray shades bordered the clouds; under an<br/>opaque belt, a luminous line clearly traced the horizon. The crests<br/>of the billows were tipped with a wild light, and the foam regained<br/>its whiteness. At the same time on the left the hilly parts of the<br/>coast could be seen, though very indistinctly.<br/><br/>At six o'clock day had broken. The clouds rapidly lifted. The<br/>seaman and his companions were then about six miles from the<br/>Chimneys. They were following a very flat shore bounded by a reef<br/>of rocks, whose heads scarcely emerged from the sea, for they were<br/>in deep water. On the left, the country appeared to be one vast<br/>extent of sandy downs, bristling with thistles. There was no cliff,<br/>and the shore offered no resistance to the ocean but a chain of<br/>irregular hillocks. Here and there grew two or three trees,<br/>inclined towards the west, their branches projecting in that<br/>direction. Quite behind, in the southwest, extended the border of<br/>the forest.<br/><br/>At this moment, Top became very excited. He ran forward, then<br/>returned, and seemed to entreat them to hasten their steps. The dog<br/>then left the beach, and guided by his wonderful instinct, without<br/>showing the least hesitation, went straight in among the downs.<br/>They followed him. The country appeared an absolute desert. Not a<br/>living creature was to be seen.<br/><br/>The downs, the extent of which was large, were composed of<br/>hillocks and even of hills, very irregularly distributed. They<br/>resembled a Switzerland modeled in sand, and only an amazing<br/>instinct could have possibly recognized the way.<br/><br/>Five minutes after having left the beach, the reporter and his<br/>two companions arrived at a sort of excavation, hollowed out at the<br/>back of a high mound. There Top stopped, and gave a loud, clear<br/>bark. Spilett, Herbert, and Pencroft dashed into the cave.<br/><br/>Neb was there, kneeling beside a body extended on a bed of<br/>grass.<br/><br/>The body was that of the engineer, Cyrus Harding.<br/>
