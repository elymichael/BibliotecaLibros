<br/>Until a more complete exploration, it might be admitted that the<br/>island was uninhabited. But was it frequented, at least<br/>occasionally, by the natives of neighboring islands? It was<br/>difficult to reply to this question. No land appeared within a<br/>radius of fifty miles. But fifty miles could be easily crossed,<br/>either by Malay proas or by the large Polynesian canoes. Everything<br/>depended on the position of the island, of its isolation in the<br/>Pacific, or of its proximity to archipelagoes. Would Cyrus Harding<br/>be able to find out their latitude and longitude without<br/>instruments? It would be difficult. Since he was in doubt, it was<br/>best to take precautions against a possible descent of neighboring<br/>natives.<br/><br/>The exploration of the island was finished, its shape<br/>determined, its features made out, its extent calculated, the water<br/>and mountain systems ascertained. The disposition of the forests<br/>and plains had been marked in a general way on the reporter's plan.<br/>They had now only to descend the mountain slopes again, and explore<br/>the soil, in the triple point of view, of its mineral, vegetable,<br/>and animal resources.<br/><br/>But before giving his companions the signal for departure, Cyrus<br/>Harding said to them in a calm, grave voice,—<br/><br/>Here, my friends, is the small corner of land upon which the<br/>hand of the Almighty has thrown us. We are going to live here; a<br/>long time, perhaps. Perhaps, too, unexpected help will arrive, if<br/>some ship passes by chance. I say by chance, because this is an<br/>unimportant island; there is not even a port in which ships could<br/>anchor, and it is to be feared that it is situated out of the route<br/>usually followed, that is to say, too much to the south for the<br/>ships which frequent the archipelagoes of the Pacific, and too much<br/>to the north for those which go to Australia by doubling Cape Horn.<br/>I wish to hide nothing of our position from you—"<br/><br/>"And you are right, my dear Cyrus," replied the reporter, with<br/>animation. "You have to deal with men. They have confidence in you,<br/>and you can depend upon them. Is it not so, my friends?"<br/><br/>"I will obey you in everything, captain," said Herbert, seizing<br/>the engineer's hand.<br/><br/>"My master always, and everywhere!" cried Neb.<br/><br/>"As for me," said the sailor, "if I ever grumble at work, my<br/>name's not Jack Pencroft, and if you like, captain, we will make a<br/>little America of this island! We will build towns, we will<br/>establish railways, start telegraphs, and one fine day, when it is<br/>quite changed, quite put in order and quite civilized, we will go<br/>and offer it to the government of the Union. Only, I ask one<br/>thing."<br/><br/>"What is that?" said the reporter.<br/><br/>"It is, that we do not consider ourselves castaways, but<br/>colonists, who have come here to settle." Harding could not help<br/>smiling, and the sailor's idea was adopted. He then thanked his<br/>companions, and added, that he would rely on their energy and on<br/>the aid of Heaven.<br/><br/>
