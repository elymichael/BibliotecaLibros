<br/>"Yes, that is to be feared!" said the reporter. "Then,<br/>doubtless, the convicts installed themselves in the corral where<br/>they found plenty of everything, and only fled when they saw us<br/>coming. It is very evident, too, that at this moment Ayrton,<br/>whether living or dead, is not here!"<br/><br/>"We shall have to beat the forest," said the engineer, "and rid<br/>the island of these wretches. Pencroft's presentiments were not<br/>mistaken, when he wished to hunt them as wild beasts. That would<br/>have spared us all these misfortunes!"<br/><br/>"Yes," answered the reporter, "but now we have the right to be<br/>merciless!"<br/><br/>"At any rate," said the engineer, "we are obliged to wait some<br/>time, and to remain at the corral until we can carry Herbert<br/>without danger to Granite House."<br/><br/>"But Neb?" asked the reporter.<br/><br/>"Neb is in safety."<br/><br/>"But if, uneasy at our absence, he would venture to come?"<br/><br/>"He must not come!" returned Cyrus Harding quickly. "He would be<br/>murdered on the road!"<br/><br/>"It is very probable, however, that he will attempt to rejoin<br/>us!"<br/><br/>"Ah, if the telegraph still acted, he might be warned! But that<br/>is impossible now! As to leaving Pencroft and Herbert here alone,<br/>we could not do it! Well, I will go alone to Granite House."<br/><br/>
