<br/>Pencroft took leave of the two friends, and returned to his<br/>lodging, where young Herbert Brown had remained. The courageous boy<br/>knew of the sailor's plan, and it was not without anxiety that he<br/>awaited the result of the proposal being made to the engineer. Thus<br/>five determined persons were about to abandon themselves to the<br/>mercy of the tempestuous elements!<br/><br/>No! the storm did not abate, and neither Jonathan Forster nor<br/>his companions dreamed of confronting it in that frail car.<br/><br/>It would be a terrible journey. The engineer only feared one<br/>thing; it was that the balloon, held to the ground and dashed about<br/>by the wind, would be torn into shreds. For several hours he roamed<br/>round the nearly- deserted square, surveying the apparatus.<br/>Pencroft did the same on his side, his hands in his pockets,<br/>yawning now and then like a man who did not know how to kill the<br/>time, but really dreading, like his friend, either the escape or<br/>destruction of the balloon. Evening arrived. The night was dark in<br/>the extreme. Thick mists passed like clouds close to the ground.<br/>Rain fell mingled with snow. it was very cold. A mist hung over<br/>Richmond. it seemed as if the violent storm had produced a truce<br/>between the besiegers and the besieged, and that the cannon were<br/>silenced by the louder detonations of the storm. The streets of the<br/>town were deserted. It had not even appeared necessary in that<br/>horrible weather to place a guard in the square, in the midst of<br/>which plunged the balloon. Everything favored the departure of the<br/>prisoners, but what might possibly be the termination of the<br/>hazardous voyage they contemplated in the midst of the furious<br/>elements?â€”<br/><br/>"Dirty weather!" exclaimed Pencroft, fixing his hat firmly on<br/>his head with a blow of his fist; "but pshaw, we shall succeed all<br/>the same!"<br/><br/>At half-past nine, Harding and his companions glided from<br/>different directions into the square, which the gas-lamps,<br/>extinguished by the wind, had left in total obscurity. Even the<br/>enormous balloon, almost beaten to the ground, could not be seen.<br/>Independently of the sacks of ballast, to which the cords of the<br/>net were fastened, the car was held by a strong cable passed<br/>through a ring in the pavement. The five prisoners met by the car.<br/>They had not been perceived, and such was the darkness that they<br/>could not even see each other.<br/><br/>Without speaking a word, Harding, Spilett, Neb, and Herbert took<br/>their places in the car, while Pencroft by the engineer's order<br/>detached successively the bags of ballast. It was the work of a few<br/>minutes only, and the sailor rejoined his companions.<br/><br/>The balloon was then only held by the cable, and the engineer<br/>had nothing to do but to give the word.<br/><br/>At that moment a dog sprang with a bound into the car. It was<br/>Top, a favorite of the engineer. The faithful creature, having<br/>broken his chain, had followed his master. He, however, fearing<br/>that its additional weight might impede their ascent, wished to<br/>send away the animal.<br/><br/>"One more will make but little difference, poor beast!"<br/>exclaimed Pencroft, heaving out two bags of sand, and as he spoke<br/>letting go the cable; the balloon ascending in an oblique<br/>direction, disappeared, after having dashed the car against two<br/>chimneys, which it threw down as it swept by them.<br/><br/>Then, indeed, the full rage of the hurricane was exhibited to<br/>the voyagers. During the night the engineer could not dream of<br/>descending, and when day broke, even a glimpse of the earth below<br/>was intercepted by fog.<br/><br/>
