"Evidently," replied Spilett.<br/><br/>"But what's in this chest?" cried Pencroft, with very natural<br/>impatience. "What's in this chest? It is shut up, and nothing to<br/>open it with! Well, perhaps a stone—"<br/><br/>And the sailor, raising a heavy block, was about to break in one<br/>of the sides of the chest, when the engineer arrested his hand.<br/><br/>"Pencroft," said he, "can you restrain your impatience for one<br/>hour only?"<br/><br/>But, captain, just think! Perhaps there is everything we want in<br/>there!"<br/><br/>"We shall find that out, Pencroft," replied the engineer; "but<br/>trust to me, and do not break the chest, which may be useful to us.<br/>We must convey it to Granite House, where we can open it easily,<br/>and without breaking it. It is quite prepared for a voyage; and<br/>since it has floated here, it may just as well float to the mouth<br/>of the river."<br/><br/>"You are right, captain, and I was wrong, as usual," replied the<br/>sailor.<br/><br/>The engineer's advice was good. In fact, the canoe probably<br/>would not have been able to contain the articles possibly enclosed<br/>in the chest, which doubtless was heavy, since two empty barrels<br/>were required to buoy it up. It was, therefore, much better to tow<br/>it to the beach at Granite House.<br/><br/>And now, whence had this chest come? That was the important<br/>question. Cyrus Harding and his companions looked attentively<br/>around them, and examined the shore for several hundred steps. No<br/>other articles or pieces of wreck could be found. Herbert and Neb<br/>climbed a high rock to survey the sea, but there was nothing in<br/>sight—neither a dismasted vessel nor a ship under sail.<br/><br/>However, there was no doubt that there had been a wreck. Perhaps<br/>this incident was connected with that of the bullet? Perhaps<br/>strangers had landed on another part of the island? Perhaps they<br/>were still there? But the thought which came naturally to the<br/>settlers was, that these strangers could not be Malay pirates, for<br/>the chest was evidently of American or European make.<br/><br/>All the party returned to the chest, which was of an unusually<br/>large size. It was made of oak wood, very carefully closed and<br/>covered with a thick hide, which was secured by copper nails. The<br/>two great barrels, hermetically sealed, but which sounded hollow<br/>and empty, were fastened to its sides by strong ropes, knotted with<br/>a skill which Pencroft directly pronounced sailors alone could<br/>exhibit. It appeared to be in a perfect state of preservation,<br/>which was explained by the fact that it had stranded on a sandy<br/>beach, and not among rocks. They had no doubt whatever, on<br/>examining it carefully, that it had not been long in the water, and<br/>that its arrival on this coast was recent. The water did not appear<br/>to have penetrated to the inside, and the articles which it<br/>contained were no doubt uninjured.<br/>
