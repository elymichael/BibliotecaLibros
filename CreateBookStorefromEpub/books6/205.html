<br/>"What do you want to say, Neb?" asked the engineer.<br/><br/>"If we return by the shore to Claw Cape," replied Neb, "after<br/>having doubled the Cape, we shall be stoppedâ€”"<br/><br/>"By the Mercy! of course," replied Herbert, "and we shall have<br/>neither bridge nor boat by which to cross."<br/><br/>"But, captain," added Pencroft, "with a few floating trunks we<br/>shall have no difficulty in crossing the river."<br/><br/>"Never mind," said Spilett, "it will be useful to construct a<br/>bridge if we wish to have an easy access to the Far West!"<br/><br/>"A bridge!" cried Pencroft.
