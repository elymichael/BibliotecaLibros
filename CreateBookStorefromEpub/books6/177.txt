"Then how did it manage?"

"At what distance from the sea did you leave this turtle?" asked
the engineer, who, having suspended his work, was reflecting on
this incident.

"Fifteen feet at the most," replied Herbert.

"And the tide was low at the time?"

"Yes, captain."

"Well," replied the engineer, "what the turtle could not do on
the sand it might have been able to do in the water. It turned over
when the tide overtook it, and then quietly returned to the deep
sea."

"Oh! what stupids we were!" cried Neb.

"That is precisely what I had the honor of telling you before!"
returned the sailor.

Cyrus Harding had given this explanation, which, no doubt, was
admissible. But was he himself convinced of the accuracy of this
explanation? It cannot be said that he was.
