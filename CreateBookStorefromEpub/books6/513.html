<br/>Whatever might be the sailor's opinion, the expedition projected<br/>by the engineer was settled for the next day. Herbert wished to<br/>accompany Cyrus Harding, but he would not vex Pencroft by his<br/>absence.<br/><br/>The next day, at dawn, Cyrus Harding and Ayrton, mounting the<br/>cart drawn by two onagers, took the road to the corral and set off<br/>at a round trot.<br/><br/>Above the forest were passing large clouds, to which the crater<br/>of Mount Franklin incessantly added fuliginous matter. These<br/>clouds, which rolled heavily in the air, were evidently composed of<br/>heterogeneous substances. It was not alone from the volcano that<br/>they derived their strange opacity and weight. Scoriae, in a state<br/>of dust, like powdered pumice-stone, and grayish ashes as small as<br/>the finest feculae, were held in suspension in the midst of their<br/>thick folds. These ashes are so fine that they have been observed<br/>in the air for whole months. After the eruption of 1783 in Iceland<br/>for upwards of a year the atmosphere was thus charged with volcanic<br/>dust through which the rays of the sun were only with difficulty<br/>discernible.<br/><br/>But more often this pulverized matter falls, and this happened<br/>on the present occasion. Cyrus Harding and Ayrton had scarcely<br/>reached the corral when a sort of black snow like fine gunpowder<br/>fell, and instantly changed the appearance of the soil. Trees,<br/>meadows, all disappeared beneath a covering several inches in<br/>depth. But, very fortunately, the wind blew from the northeast, and<br/>the greater part of the cloud dissolved itself over the sea.<br/><br/>"This is very singular, Captain Harding," said Ayrton.<br/><br/>"It is very serious," replied the engineer. "This powdered<br/>pumice-stone, all this mineral dust, proves how grave is the<br/>convulsion going forward in the lower depths of the volcano."<br/><br/>"But can nothing be done?"<br/><br/>"Nothing, except to note the progress of the phenomenon. Do you,<br/>therefore, Ayrton, occupy yourself with the necessary work at the<br/>corral. In the meantime I will ascend just beyond the source of Red<br/>Creek and examine the condition of the mountain upon its northern<br/>aspect. Thenâ€”"<br/><br/>"Well, Captain Harding?"<br/><br/>"Then we will pay a visit to Dakkar Grotto. I wish to inspect<br/>it. At any rate I will come back for you in two hours."<br/><br/>
