"What is done cannot be undone," replied Cyrus Harding. "We must
consult what it will now be best to do."

Such were the questions and answers which were rapidly exchanged
between Harding and his companions. It was certain that the bridge
had been crossed, that the shore had been invaded by animals, and
that whatever they might be they could by ascending the left bank
of the Mercy reach Prospect Heights. They must therefore be
advanced against quickly and fought with if necessary.

"But what are these beasts?" was asked a second time, as the
yelpings were again heard more loudly than before. These yelps made
Herbert start, and he remembered having heard them before during
his first visit to the sources of the Red Creek.

"They are colpeo foxes!" he exclaimed.

"Forward!" shouted the sailor.

And all arming themselves with hatchets, carbines, and
revolvers, threw themselves into the lift and soon set foot on the
shore.

Colpeos are dangerous animals when in great numbers and
irritated by hunger, nevertheless the colonists did not hesitate to
throw themselves into the midst of the troop, and their first shots
vividly lighting up the darkness made their assailants draw
back.

The chief thing was to hinder these plunderers from reaching the
plateau, for the garden and the poultry-yard would then have been
at their mercy, and immense, perhaps irreparable mischief, would
inevitably be the result, especially with regard to the corn-field.
But as the invasion of the plateau could only be made by the left
bank of the Mercy, it was sufficient to oppose the colpeos on the
narrow bank between the river and the cliff of granite.

This was plain to all, and, by Cyrus Harding's orders, they
reached the spot indicated by him, while the colpeos rushed
fiercely through the gloom. Harding, Gideon Spilett, Herbert,
Pencroft and Neb posted themselves in impregnable line. Top, his
formidable jaws open, preceded the colonists, and he was followed
by Jup, armed with knotty cudgel, which he brandished like a
club.

The night was extremely dark, it was only by the flashes from
the revolvers as each person fired that they could see their
assailants, who were at least a hundred in number, and whose eyes
were glowing like hot coals.

"They must not pass!" shouted Pencroft.
