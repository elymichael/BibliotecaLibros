<br/>It had indeed been a narrow escape for Cyrus Harding!<br/><br/>Neb then recounted what had happened. The day before, after<br/>having left the Chimneys at daybreak, he had ascended the coast in<br/>a northerly direction, and had reached that part of the shore which<br/>he had already visited.<br/><br/>There, without any hope he acknowledged, Neb had searched the<br/>beach, among the rocks, on the sand, for the smallest trace to<br/>guide him. He examined particularly that part of the beach which<br/>was not covered by the high tide, for near the sea the water would<br/>have obliterated all marks. Neb did not expect to find his master<br/>living. It was for a corpse that he searched, a corpse which he<br/>wished to bury with his own hands!<br/><br/>He sought long in vain. This desert coast appeared never to have<br/>been visited by a human creature. The shells, those which the sea<br/>had not reached, and which might be met with by millions above<br/>high-water mark, were untouched. Not a shell was broken.<br/><br/>Neb then resolved to walk along the beach for some miles. It was<br/>possible that the waves had carried the body to quite a distant<br/>point. When a corpse floats a little distance from a low shore, it<br/>rarely happens that the tide does not throw it up, sooner or later.<br/>This Neb knew, and he wished to see his master again for the last<br/>time.<br/><br/>"I went along the coast for another two miles, carefully<br/>examining the beach, both at high and low water, and I had<br/>despaired of finding anything, when yesterday, above five in the<br/>evening, I saw footprints on the sand."<br/><br/>"Footprints?" exclaimed Pencroft.<br/><br/>"Yes!" replied Neb.<br/><br/>"Did these footprints begin at the water's edge?" asked the<br/>reporter.<br/><br/>"No," replied Neb, "only above high-water mark, for the others<br/>must have been washed out by the tide."<br/><br/>
