<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>19<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>Two years already! and for two years the colonists had had no<br/>communication with their fellow-creatures! They were without news<br/>from the civilized world, lost on this island, as completely as if<br/>they had been on the most minute star of the celestial<br/>hemisphere!<br/><br/>What was now happening in their country? The picture of their<br/>native land was always before their eyes, the land torn by civil<br/>war at the time they left it, and which the Southern rebellion was<br/>perhaps still staining with blood! It was a great sorrow to them,<br/>and they often talked together of these things, without ever<br/>doubting however that the cause of the North must triumph, for the<br/>honor of the American Confederation.<br/><br/>During these two years not a vessel had passed in sight of the<br/>island; or, at least, not a sail had been seen. It was evident that<br/>Lincoln Island was out of the usual track, and also that it was<br/>unknown,—as was besides proved by the maps,—for though there was no<br/>port, vessels might have visited it for the purpose of renewing<br/>their store of water. But the surrounding ocean was deserted as far<br/>as the eye could reach, and the colonists must rely on themselves<br/>for regaining their native land.<br/><br/>However, one chance of rescue existed, and this chance was<br/>discussed one day on the first week of April, when the colonists<br/>were gathered together in the dining-room of Granite House.<br/><br/>They had been talking of America, of their native country, which<br/>they had so little hope of ever seeing again.<br/><br/>"Decidedly we have only one way, said Spilett, "one single way<br/>for leaving Lincoln Island, and that is, to build a vessel large<br/>enough to sail several hundred miles. It appears to me, that when<br/>one has built a boat it is just as easy to build a ship!"<br/><br/>
