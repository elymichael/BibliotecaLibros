The sky appeared on fire. The superior cone, a mass of rock a<br/>thousand feet in height, and weighing thousands of millions of<br/>pounds, had been thrown down upon the island, making it tremble to<br/>its foundation. Fortunately, this cone inclined to the north, and<br/>had fallen upon the plain of sand and tufa stretching between the<br/>volcano and the sea. The aperture of the crater being thus enlarged<br/>projected towards the sky a glare so intense that by the simple<br/>effect of reflection the atmosphere appeared red-hot. At the same<br/>time a torrent of lava, bursting from the new summit, poured out in<br/>long cascades, like water escaping from a vase too full, and a<br/>thousand tongues of fire crept over the sides of the volcano.<br/><br/>"The corral! the corral!" exclaimed Ayrton.<br/><br/>It was, in fact, towards the corral that the lava was rushing as<br/>the new crater faced the east, and consequently the fertile<br/>portions of the island, the springs of Red Creek and Jacamar Wood,<br/>were menaced with instant destruction.<br/><br/>At Ayrton's cry the colonists rushed to the onagers' stables.<br/>The cart was at once harnessed. All were possessed by the same<br/>thought—to hasten to the corral and set at liberty the animals it<br/>enclosed.<br/><br/>Before three in the morning they arrived at the corral. The<br/>cries of the terrified musmons and goats indicated the alarm which<br/>possessed them. Already a torrent of burning matter and liquefied<br/>minerals fell from the side of the mountain upon the meadows as far<br/>as the side of the palisade. The gate was burst open by Ayrton, and<br/>the animals, bewildered with terror, fled in all directions.<br/><br/>An hour afterwards the boiling lava filled the corral,<br/>converting into vapor the water of the little rivulet which ran<br/>through it, burning up the house like dry grass, and leaving not<br/>even a post of the palisade to mark the spot where the corral once<br/>stood.<br/><br/>To contend against this disaster would have been folly—nay,<br/>madness. In presence of Nature's grand convulsions man is<br/>powerless.<br/><br/>It was now daylight—the 24th of January. Cyrus Harding and his<br/>companions, before returning to Granite House, desired to ascertain<br/>the probable direction this inundation of lava was about to take.<br/>The soil sloped gradually from Mount Franklin to the east coast,<br/>and it was to be feared that, in spite of the thick Jacamar Wood,<br/>the torrent would reach the plateau of Prospect Heights.<br/><br/>"The lake will cover us," said Gideon Spilett.<br/><br/>"I hope so!" was Cyrus Harding's only reply.<br/><br/>The colonists were desirous of reaching the plain upon which the<br/>superior cone of Mount Franklin had fallen, but the lava arrested<br/>their progress. It had followed, on one side, the valley of Red<br/>Creek, and on the other that of Falls River, evaporating those<br/>watercourses in its passage. There was no possibility of crossing<br/>the torrent of lava; on the contrary, the colonists were obliged to<br/>retreat before it. The volcano, without its crown, was no longer<br/>recognizable, terminated as it was by a sort of flat table which<br/>replaced the ancient crater. From two openings in its southern and<br/>eastern sides an unceasing flow of lava poured forth, thus forming<br/>two distinct streams. Above the new crater a cloud of smoke and<br/>ashes, mingled with those of the atmosphere, massed over the<br/>island. Loud peals of thunder broke, and could scarcely be<br/>distinguished from the rumblings of the mountain, whose mouth<br/>vomited forth ignited rocks, which, hurled to more than a thousand<br/>feet, burst in the air like shells. Flashes of lightning rivaled in<br/>intensity the volcano's eruption.<br/>
