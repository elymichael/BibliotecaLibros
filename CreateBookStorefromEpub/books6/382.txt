In the meanwhile the brig approached the islet, and it could be
seen that she was endeavoring to make the lower end. The breeze was
light, and as the current had then lost much of its force, Bob
Harvey had absolute command over his vessel.

The route previously followed by the boats had allowed her to
reconnoiter the channel, and she boldly entered it.

The pirate's design was now only too evident; he wished to bring
her broadside to bear on the Chimneys and from there to reply with
shell and ball to the shot which had till then decimated her
crew.

Soon the "Speedy" reached the point of the islet; she rounded it
with ease; the mainsail was braced up, and the brig hugging the
wind, stood across the mouth of the Mercy.

"The scoundrels! they are coming!" said Pencroft.

At that moment, Cyrus Harding, Ayrton, the sailor, and Herbert,
were rejoined by Neb and Gideon Spilett.

The reporter and his companion had judged it best to abandon the
post at the Mercy, from which they could do nothing against the
ship, and they had acted wisely. It was better that the colonists
should be together at the moment when they were about to engage in
a decisive action. Gideon Spilett and Neb had arrived by dodging
behind the rocks, though not without attracting a shower of
bullets, which had not, however, reached them.

"Spilett! Neb!" cried the engineer. "You are not wounded?"

"No," answered the reporter, "a few bruises only from the
ricochet! But that cursed brig has entered the channel!"

"Yes," replied Pencroft, "and in ten minutes she will have
anchored before Granite House!"

"Have you formed any plan, Cyrus?" asked the reporter.
