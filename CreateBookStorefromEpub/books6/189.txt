"Well!" exclaimed Pencroft, "when that day comes, I do not know
what more will be wanting in our island!"

These different plants, which had been carefully rooted up, were
carried to the canoe, where Cyrus Harding had remained buried in
thought.

The reporter, Herbert, and Pencroft in this manner frequently
disembarked, sometimes on the right bank, sometimes on the left
bank of the Mercy.

The latter was less abrupt, but the former more wooded. The
engineer ascertained by consulting his pocket-compass that the
direction of the river from the first turn was obviously southwest
and northeast, and nearly straight for a length of about three
miles. But it was to be supposed that this direction changed beyond
that point, and that the Mercy continued to the north-west, towards
the spurs of Mount Franklin, among which the river rose.

During one of these excursions, Gideon Spilett managed to get
hold of two couples of living gallinaceae. They were birds with
long, thin beaks, lengthened necks, short wings, and without any
appearance of a tail. Herbert rightly gave them the name of
tinamous, and it was resolved that they should be the first tenants
of their future poultry-yard.

But till then the guns had not spoken, and the first report
which awoke the echoes of the forest of the Far West was provoked
by the appearance of a beautiful bird, resembling the
kingfisher.

"I recognize him!" cried Pencroft, and it seemed as if his gun
went off by itself.

"What do you recognize?" asked the reporter.

"The bird which escaped us on our first excursion, and from
which we gave the name to that part of the forest."

"A jacamar!" cried Herbert.
