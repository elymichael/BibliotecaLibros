"Good! And do you think now that she could undertake a voyage of<br/>some extent?"<br/><br/>"What voyage, Pencroft?"<br/><br/>"One to Tabor Island, for instance."<br/><br/>"My friend," replied Harding, "I think that in any pressing<br/>emergency we need not hesitate to trust ourselves to the<br/>'Bonadventure' even for a longer voyage; but you know I should see<br/>you set off to Tabor Island with great uneasiness, since nothing<br/>obliges you to go there."<br/><br/>"One likes to know one's neighbors," returned the sailor, who<br/>was obstinate in his idea. "Tabor Island is our neighbor, and the<br/>only one! Politeness requires us to go at least to pay a<br/>visit."<br/><br/>"By Jove," said Spilett, "our friend Pencroft has become very<br/>particular about the proprieties all at once!"<br/><br/>"I am not particular about anything at all," retorted the<br/>sailor, who was rather vexed by the engineer's opposition, but who<br/>did not wish to cause him anxiety.<br/><br/>"Consider, Pencroft," resumed Harding, "you cannot go alone to<br/>Tabor Island."<br/><br/>"One companion will be enough for me."<br/><br/>"Even so," replied the engineer, "you will risk depriving the<br/>colony of Lincoln Island of two settlers out of five."<br/><br/>"Out of six," answered Pencroft; "you forget Jup."<br/>
