<br/>"What a pity!" said Herbert, "such a useful tree, and which has<br/>such beautiful nuts!"<br/><br/>As to the birds, they swarmed among the scanty branches of the<br/>eucalypti and casuarinas, which did not hinder the display of their<br/>wings. Black, white, or gray cockatoos, paroquets, with plumage of<br/>all colors, kingfishers of a sparkling green and crowned with red,<br/>blue lories, and various other birds appeared on all sides, as<br/>through a prism, fluttering about and producing a deafening clamor.<br/>Suddenly, a strange concert of discordant voices resounded in the<br/>midst of a thicket. The settlers heard successively the song of<br/>birds, the cry of quadrupeds, and a sort of clacking which they<br/>might have believed to have escaped from the lips of a native. Neb<br/>and Herbert rushed towards the bush, forgetting even the most<br/>elementary principles of prudence. Happily, they found there,<br/>neither a formidable wild beast nor a dangerous native, but merely<br/>half a dozen mocking and singing birds, known as mountain<br/>pheasants. A few skillful blows from a stick soon put an end to<br/>their concert, and procured excellent food for the evening's<br/>dinner.<br/><br/>Herbert also discovered some magnificent pigeons with bronzed<br/>wings, some superbly crested, others draped in green, like their<br/>congeners at Port- Macquarie; but it was impossible to reach them,<br/>or the crows and magpies which flew away in flocks.<br/><br/>A charge of small shot would have made great slaughter among<br/>these birds, but the hunters were still limited to sticks and<br/>stones, and these primitive weapons proved very insufficient.<br/><br/>Their insufficiency was still more clearly shown when a troop of<br/>quadrupeds, jumping, bounding, making leaps of thirty feet, regular<br/>flying mammiferae, fled over the thickets, so quickly and at such a<br/>height, that one would have thought that they passed from one tree<br/>to another like squirrels.<br/><br/>"Kangaroos!" cried Herbert.<br/><br/>"Are they good to eat?" asked Pencroft.<br/><br/>"Stewed," replied the reporter, "their flesh is equal to the<br/>best venison!â€”"<br/><br/>Gideon Spilett had not finished this exciting sentence when the<br/>sailor, followed by Neb and Herbert, darted on the kangaroos<br/>tracks. Cyrus Harding called them back in vain. But it was in vain<br/>too for the hunters to pursue such agile game, which went bounding<br/>away like balls. After a chase of five minutes, they lost their<br/>breath, and at the same time all sight of the creatures, which<br/>disappeared in the wood. Top was not more successful than his<br/>masters.<br/><br/>"Captain," said Pencroft, when the engineer and the reporter had<br/>rejoined them, "Captain, you see quite well we can't get on unless<br/>we make a few guns. Will that be possible?"<br/><br/>
