"Yes," said Gideon Spilett, "but his reserve does him honor, and<br/>it is right to respect the feeling which he has about his sad<br/>past."<br/><br/>"Certainly, Mr. Spilett," answered the sailor, "and there is no<br/>fear of my doing so again. I would rather bite my tongue off than<br/>cause Ayrton any pain! But to return to the question. It seems to<br/>me that these ruffians have no right to any pity, and that we ought<br/>to rid the island of them as soon as possible."<br/><br/>"Is that your opinion, Pencroft?" asked the engineer.<br/><br/>"Quite my opinion."<br/><br/>"And before hunting them mercilessly, you would not wait until<br/>they had committed some fresh act of hostility against us?"<br/><br/>"Isn't what they have done already enough?" asked Pencroft, who<br/>did not understand these scruples.<br/><br/>"They may adopt other sentiments!" said Harding, "and perhaps<br/>repent."<br/><br/>"They repent!" exclaimed the sailor, shrugging his<br/>shoulders.<br/><br/>"Pencroft, think of Ayrton!" said Herbert, taking the sailor's<br/>hand. "He became an honest man again!"<br/><br/>Pencroft looked at his companions one after the other. He had<br/>never thought of his proposal being met with any objection. His<br/>rough nature could not allow that they ought to come to terms with<br/>the rascals who had landed on the island with Bob Harvey's<br/>accomplices, the murderers of the crew of the "Speedy," and he<br/>looked upon them as wild beasts which ought to be destroyed without<br/>delay and without remorse.<br/><br/>"Come!" said be. "Everybody is against me! You wish to be<br/>generous to those villains! Very well; I hope we mayn't repent<br/>it!"<br/>
