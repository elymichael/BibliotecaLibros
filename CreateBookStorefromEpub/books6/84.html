"There is only the point at the southeastern extremity of the<br/>island to be named," said Pencroft.<br/><br/>"That is, the extremity of Union Bay?" asked Herbert.<br/><br/>"Claw Cape," cried Neb directly, who also wished to be godfather<br/>to some part of his domain.<br/><br/>In truth, Neb had found an excellent name, for this cape was<br/>very like the powerful claw of the fantastic animal which this<br/>singularly-shaped island represented.<br/><br/>Pencroft was delighted at the turn things had taken, and their<br/>imaginations soon gave to the river which furnished the settlers<br/>with drinking water and near which the balloon had thrown them, the<br/>name of the Mercy, in true gratitude to Providence. To the islet<br/>upon which the castaways had first landed, the name of Safety<br/>Island; to the plateau which crowned the high granite precipice<br/>above the Chimneys, and from whence the gaze could embrace the<br/>whole of the vast bay, the name of Prospect Heights.<br/><br/>Lastly, all the masses of impenetrable wood which covered the<br/>Serpentine Peninsula were named the forests of the Far West.<br/><br/>The nomenclature of the visible and known parts of the island<br/>was thus finished, and later, they would complete it as they made<br/>fresh discoveries.<br/><br/>As to the points of the compass, the engineer had roughly fixed<br/>them by the height and position of the sun, which placed Union Bay<br/>and Prospect Heights to the east. But the next day, by taking the<br/>exact hour of the rising and setting of the sun, and by marking its<br/>position between this rising and setting, he reckoned to fix the<br/>north of the island exactly, for, in consequence of its situation<br/>in the Southern Hemisphere, the sun, at the precise moment of its<br/>culmination, passed in the north and not in the south, as, in its<br/>apparent movement, it seems to do, to those places situated in the<br/>Northern Hemisphere.<br/><br/>Everything was finished, and the settlers had only to descend<br/>Mount Franklin to return to the Chimneys, when Pencroft cried<br/>out,â€”<br/><br/>"Well! we are preciously stupid!"<br/><br/>"Why?" asked Gideon Spilett, who had closed his notebook and<br/>risen to depart.<br/>
