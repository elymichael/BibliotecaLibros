<br/>Then Ayrton, approaching the engineer, said simply, "Where<br/>should this coffer be deposited?"<br/><br/>It was the coffer which Ayrton had saved at the risk of his<br/>life, at the very instant that the island had been engulfed, and<br/>which he now faithfully handed to the engineer.<br/><br/>"Ayrton! Ayrton!" said Cyrus Harding, deeply touched. Then,<br/>addressing Robert Grant, "Sir," he added, "you left behind you a<br/>criminal; you find in his place a man who has become honest by<br/>penitence, and whose hand I am proud to clasp in mine."<br/><br/>Robert Grant was now made acquainted with the strange history of<br/>Captain Nemo and the colonists of Lincoln Island. Then, observation<br/>being taken of what remained of this shoal, which must henceforward<br/>figure on the charts of the Pacific, the order was given to make<br/>all sail.<br/><br/>A few weeks afterwards the colonists landed in America, and<br/>found their country once more at peace alter the terrible conflict<br/>in which right and justice had triumphed.<br/><br/>Of the treasures contained in the coffer left by Captain Nemo to<br/>the colonists of Lincoln Island, the larger portion was employed in<br/>the purchase of a vast territory in the State of Iowa. One pearl<br/>alone, the finest, was reserved from the treasure and sent to Lady<br/>Glenarvan in the name of the castaways restored to their country by<br/>the "Duncan."<br/><br/>There, upon this domain, the colonists invited to labor, that is<br/>to say, to wealth and happiness, all those to whom they had hoped<br/>to offer the hospitality of Lincoln Island. There was founded a<br/>vast colony to which they gave the name of that island sunk beneath<br/>the waters of the Pacific. A river there was called the Mercy, a<br/>mountain took the name of Mount Franklin, a small lake was named<br/>Lake Grant, and the forests became the forests of the Far West. It<br/>might have been an island on terra firma.<br/><br/>There, under the intelligent hands of the engineer and his<br/>companions, everything prospered. Not one of the former colonists<br/>of Lincoln Island was absent, for they had sworn to live always<br/>together. Neb was with his master; Ayrton was there ready to<br/>sacrifice himself for all; Pencroft was more a farmer than he had<br/>ever been a sailor; Herbert, who completed his studies under the<br/>superintendence of Cyrus Harding, and Gideon Spilett, who founded<br/>the New Lincoln Herald, the best-informed journal in the world.<br/><br/>There Cyrus Harding and his companions received at intervals<br/>visits from Lord and Lady Glenarvan, Captain John Mangles and his<br/>wife, the sister of Robert Grant, Robert Grant himself, Major<br/>McNab, and all those who had taken part in the history both of<br/>Captain Grant and Captain Nemo.<br/><br/>There, to conclude, all were happy, united in the present as<br/>they had been in the past; but never could they forget that island<br/>upon which they had arrived poor and friendless, that island which,<br/>during four years had supplied all their wants, and of which there<br/>remained but a fragment of granite washed by the waves of the<br/>Pacific, the tomb of him who had borne the name of Captain<br/>Nemo.<br/><br/>
