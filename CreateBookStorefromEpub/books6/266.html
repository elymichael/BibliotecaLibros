"What is done cannot be undone," replied Cyrus Harding. "We must<br/>consult what it will now be best to do."<br/><br/>Such were the questions and answers which were rapidly exchanged<br/>between Harding and his companions. It was certain that the bridge<br/>had been crossed, that the shore had been invaded by animals, and<br/>that whatever they might be they could by ascending the left bank<br/>of the Mercy reach Prospect Heights. They must therefore be<br/>advanced against quickly and fought with if necessary.<br/><br/>"But what are these beasts?" was asked a second time, as the<br/>yelpings were again heard more loudly than before. These yelps made<br/>Herbert start, and he remembered having heard them before during<br/>his first visit to the sources of the Red Creek.<br/><br/>"They are colpeo foxes!" he exclaimed.<br/><br/>"Forward!" shouted the sailor.<br/><br/>And all arming themselves with hatchets, carbines, and<br/>revolvers, threw themselves into the lift and soon set foot on the<br/>shore.<br/><br/>Colpeos are dangerous animals when in great numbers and<br/>irritated by hunger, nevertheless the colonists did not hesitate to<br/>throw themselves into the midst of the troop, and their first shots<br/>vividly lighting up the darkness made their assailants draw<br/>back.<br/><br/>The chief thing was to hinder these plunderers from reaching the<br/>plateau, for the garden and the poultry-yard would then have been<br/>at their mercy, and immense, perhaps irreparable mischief, would<br/>inevitably be the result, especially with regard to the corn-field.<br/>But as the invasion of the plateau could only be made by the left<br/>bank of the Mercy, it was sufficient to oppose the colpeos on the<br/>narrow bank between the river and the cliff of granite.<br/><br/>This was plain to all, and, by Cyrus Harding's orders, they<br/>reached the spot indicated by him, while the colpeos rushed<br/>fiercely through the gloom. Harding, Gideon Spilett, Herbert,<br/>Pencroft and Neb posted themselves in impregnable line. Top, his<br/>formidable jaws open, preceded the colonists, and he was followed<br/>by Jup, armed with knotty cudgel, which he brandished like a<br/>club.<br/><br/>The night was extremely dark, it was only by the flashes from<br/>the revolvers as each person fired that they could see their<br/>assailants, who were at least a hundred in number, and whose eyes<br/>were glowing like hot coals.<br/><br/>"They must not pass!" shouted Pencroft.<br/>
