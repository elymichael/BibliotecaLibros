"The idea is good," replied the reporter; "but could you climb<br/>to the top of those giants?"<br/><br/>"I can at least try," replied Herbert.<br/><br/>The light and active boy then sprang on the first branches, the<br/>arrangement of which made the ascent of the kauri easy, and in a<br/>few minutes he arrived at the summit, which emerged from the<br/>immense plain of verdure.<br/><br/>From this elevated situation his gaze extended over all the<br/>southern portion of the island, from Claw Cape on the southeast, to<br/>Reptile End on the southwest. To the northwest rose Mount Franklin,<br/>which concealed a great part of the horizon.<br/><br/>But Herbert, from the height of his observatory, could examine<br/>all the yet unknown portion of the island, which might have given<br/>shelter to the strangers whose presence they suspected.<br/><br/>The lad looked attentively. There was nothing in sight on the<br/>sea, not a sail, neither on the horizon nor near the island.<br/>However, as the bank of trees hid the shore, it was possible that a<br/>vessel, especially if deprived of her masts, might lie close to the<br/>land and thus be invisible to Herbert.<br/><br/>Neither in the forests of the Far West was anything to be seen.<br/>The wood formed an impenetrable screen, measuring several square<br/>miles, without a break or an opening. It was impossible even to<br/>follow the course of the Mercy, or to ascertain in what part of the<br/>mountain it took its source. Perhaps other creeks also ran towards<br/>the west, but they could not be seen.<br/><br/>But at last, if all indication of an encampment escaped<br/>Herbert's sight could he not even catch a glimpse of smoke, the<br/>faintest trace of which would be easily discernible in the pure<br/>atmosphere?<br/><br/>For an instant Herbert thought he could perceive a slight smoke<br/>in the west, but a more attentive examination showed that he was<br/>mistaken. He strained his eyes in every direction, and his sight<br/>was excellent. No, decidedly there was nothing there.<br/><br/>Herbert descended to the foot of the kauri, and the two<br/>sportsmen returned to Granite House. There Cyrus Harding listened<br/>to the lad's account, shook his head and said nothing. It was very<br/>evident that no decided opinion could be pronounced on this<br/>question until after a complete exploration of the island.<br/><br/>Two days after—the 28th of October—another incident occurred,<br/>for which an explanation was again required.<br/>
