<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>It was now exactly seven months since the balloon voyagers had<br/>been thrown on Lincoln Island. During that time, notwithstanding<br/>the researches they had made, no human being had been discovered.<br/>No smoke even had betrayed the presence of man on the surface of<br/>the island. No vestiges of his handiwork showed that either at an<br/>early or at a late period had man lived there. Not only did it now<br/>appear to be uninhabited by any but themselves, but the colonists<br/>were compelled to believe that it never had been inhabited. And<br/>now, all this scaffolding of reasonings fell before a simple ball<br/>of metal, found in the body of an inoffensive rodent! In fact, this<br/>bullet must have issued from a firearm, and who but a human being<br/>could have used such a weapon?<br/><br/>When Pencroft had placed the bullet on the table, his companions<br/>looked at it with intense astonishment. All the consequences likely<br/>to result from this incident, notwithstanding its apparent<br/>insignificance, immediately took possession of their minds. The<br/>sudden apparition of a supernatural being could not have startled<br/>them more completely.<br/><br/>Cyrus Harding did not hesitate to give utterance to the<br/>suggestions which this fact, at once surprising and unexpected,<br/>could not fail to raise in his mind. He took the bullet, turned it<br/>over and over, rolled it between his finger and thumb; then,<br/>turning to Pencroft, he asked,â€”<br/><br/>Are you sure that the peccary wounded by this bullet was not<br/>more than three months old?"<br/><br/>"Not more, captain," replied Pencroft. "It was still sucking its<br/>mother when I found it in the trap."<br/><br/>"Well," said the engineer, "that proves that within three months<br/>a gun- shot was fired in Lincoln Island."<br/><br/>
