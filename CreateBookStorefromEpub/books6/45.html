<br/>"If the dog is found, the master will be found also!" said the<br/>reporter.<br/><br/>"God grant it!" responded Herbert. "Let us set off! Top will<br/>guide us!"<br/><br/>Pencroft did not make any objection. He felt that Top's arrival<br/>contradicted his conjectures. "Come along then!" said he.<br/><br/>Pencroft carefully covered the embers on the hearth. He placed a<br/>few pieces of wood among them, so as to keep in the fire until<br/>their return. Then, preceded by the dog, who seemed to invite them<br/>by short barks to come with him, and followed by the reporter and<br/>the boy, he dashed out, after having put up in his handkerchief the<br/>remains of the supper.<br/><br/>The storm was then in all its violence, and perhaps at its<br/>height. Not a single ray of light from the moon pierced through the<br/>clouds. To follow a straight course was difficult. It was best to<br/>rely on Top's instinct. They did so. The reporter and Herbert<br/>walked behind the dog, and the sailor brought up the rear. It was<br/>impossible to exchange a word. The rain was not very heavy, but the<br/>wind was terrific.<br/><br/>However, one circumstance favored the seaman and his two<br/>companions. The wind being southeast, consequently blew on their<br/>backs. The clouds of sand, which otherwise would have been<br/>insupportable, from being received behind, did not in consequence<br/>impede their progress. In short, they sometimes went faster than<br/>they liked, and had some difficulty in keeping their feet; but hope<br/>gave them strength, for it was not at random that they made their<br/>way along the shore. They had no doubt that Neb had found his<br/>master, and that he had sent them the faithful dog. But was the<br/>engineer living, or had Neb only sent for his companions that they<br/>might render the last duties to the corpse of the unfortunate<br/>Harding?<br/><br/>After having passed the precipice, Herbert, the reporter, and<br/>Pencroft prudently stepped aside to stop and take breath. The turn<br/>of the rocks sheltered them from the wind, and they could breathe<br/>after this walk or rather run of a quarter of an hour.<br/><br/>They could now hear and reply to each other, and the lad having<br/>pronounced the name of Cyrus Harding, Top gave a few short barks,<br/>as much as to say that his master was saved.<br/><br/>"Saved, isn't he?" repeated Herbert; "saved, Top?"<br/><br/>And the dog barked in reply.<br/><br/>
