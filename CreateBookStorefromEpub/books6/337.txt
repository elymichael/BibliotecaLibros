"And in which we might go to the Pomoutous," added Herbert,
"just as easily as we went to Tabor Island."

"I do not say no," replied Pencroft, who had always the casting
vote in maritime questions; "I do not say no, although it is not
exactly the same thing to make a long as a short voyage! If our
little craft had been caught in any heavy gale of wind during the
voyage to Tabor Island, we should have known that land was at no
great distance either way; but twelve hundred miles is a pretty
long way, and the nearest land is at least that distance!"

"Would you not, in that case, Pencroft, attempt the adventure?"
asked the reporter.

"I will attempt anything that is desired, Mr. Spilett," answered
the sailor, "and you know well that I am not a man to flinch!"

"Remember, besides, that we number another sailor amongst us
now," remarked Neb.

"Who is that?" asked Pencroft.

"Ayrton."

"If he will consent to come," said Pencroft.

"Nonsense!" returned the reporter; "do you think that if Lord
Glenarvan's yacht had appeared at Tabor Island, while he was still
living there, Ayrton would have refused to depart?"

"You forget, my friends," then said Cyrus Harding, "that Ayrton
was not in possession of his reason during the last years of his
stay there. But that is not the question. The point is to know if
we may count among our chances of being rescued, the return of the
Scotch vessel. Now, Lord Glenarvan promised Ayrton that he would
return to take him off from Tabor Island when he considered that
his crimes were expiated, and I believe that he will return."

"Yes," said the reporter, "and I will add that he will return
soon, for it is twelve years since Ayrton was abandoned."
