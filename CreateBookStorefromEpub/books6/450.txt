"I am of Cyrus' opinion," said the reporter, "and I think that
it is among the spurs of Mount Franklin that the convicts will have
made their lair."

"Then, captain, straight to the corral!" cried Pencroft. "We
must finish them off, and till now we have only lost time!"

"No, my friend," replied the engineer; "you forget that we have
a reason for wishing to know if the forests of the Far West do not
contain some habitation. Our exploration has a double object,
Pencroft. If, on the one hand, we have to chastise crime, we have,
on the other, an act of gratitude to perform."

"That was well said, captain," replied the sailor, "but, all the
same, it is my opinion that we shall not find the gentleman until
he pleases."

And truly Pencroft only expressed the opinion of all. It was
probable that the stranger's retreat was not less mysterious than
was he himself.

That evening the cart halted at the mouth of Falls River. The
camp was organized as usual, and the customary precautions were
taken for the night. Herbert, become again the healthy and vigorous
lad he was before his illness, derived great benefit from this life
in the open air, between the sea breezes and the vivifying air from
the forests. His place was no longer in the cart, but at the head
of the troop.

The next day, the 19th of February, the colonists, leaving the
shore, where, beyond the mouth, basalts of every shape were so
picturesquely piled up, ascended the river by its left bank. The
road had been already partly cleared in their former excursions
made from the corral to the west coast. The settlers were now about
six miles from Mount Franklin.

The engineer's plan was this:—To minutely survey the valley
forming the bed of the river, and to cautiously approach the
neighborhood of the corral; if the corral was occupied, to seize it
by force; if it was not, to entrench themselves there and make it
the center of the operations which had for their object the
exploration of Mount Franklin.

This plan was unanimously approved by the colonists, for they
were impatient to regain entire possession of their island.

They made their way then along the narrow valley separating two
of the largest spurs of Mount Franklin. The trees, crowded on the
river's bank, became rare on the upper slopes of the mountain. The
ground was hilly and rough, very suitable for ambushes, and over
which they did not venture without extreme precaution. Top and Jup
skirmished on the flanks, springing right and left through the
thick brushwood, and emulating each other in intelligence and
activity. But nothing showed that the banks of the stream had been
recently frequented—nothing announced either the presence or the
proximity of the convicts. Towards five in the evening the cart
stopped nearly 600 feet from the palisade. A semicircular screen of
trees still hid it.

It was necessary to reconnoiter the corral, in order to
ascertain if it was occupied. To go there openly, in broad
daylight, when the convicts were probably in ambush, would be to
expose themselves, as poor Herbert had done, to the firearms of the
ruffians. It was better, then, to wait until night came on.
