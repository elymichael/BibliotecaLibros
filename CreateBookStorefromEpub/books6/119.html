Cyrus Harding and his companions walked over this new ground<br/>with great care. Bows, arrows, and sticks with sharp iron points<br/>were their only weapons. However, no wild beast showed itself, and<br/>it was probable that these animals frequented rather the thick<br/>forests in the south; but the settlers had the disagreeable<br/>surprise of seeing Top stop before a snake of great size, measuring<br/>from fourteen to fifteen feet in length. Neb killed it by a blow<br/>from his stick. Cyrus Harding examined the reptile, and declared it<br/>not venomous, for it belonged to that species of diamond serpents<br/>which the natives of New South Wales rear. But it was possible that<br/>others existed whose bite was mortal such as the deaf vipers with<br/>forked tails, which rise up under the feet, or those winged snakes,<br/>furnished with two ears, which enable them to proceed with great<br/>rapidity. Top, the first moment of surprise over, began a reptile<br/>chase with such eagerness, that they feared for his safety. His<br/>master called him back directly.<br/><br/>The mouth of the Red Creek, at the place where it entered into<br/>the lake, was soon reached. The explorers recognized on the<br/>opposite shore the point which they had visited on their descent<br/>from Mount Franklin. Cyrus Harding ascertained that the flow of<br/>water into it from the creek was considerable. Nature must<br/>therefore have provided some place for the escape of the overplus.<br/>This doubtless formed a fall, which, if it could be discovered,<br/>would be of great use.<br/><br/>The colonists, walking apart, but not straying far from each<br/>other, began to skirt the edge of the lake, which was very steep.<br/>The water appeared to be full of fish, and Pencroft resolved to<br/>make some fishing-rods, so as to try and catch some.<br/><br/>The northeast point was first to be doubled. It might have been<br/>supposed that the discharge of water was at this place, for the<br/>extremity of the lake was almost on a level with the edge of the<br/>plateau. But no signs of this were discovered, and the colonists<br/>continued to explore the bank, which, after a slight bend,<br/>descended parallel to the shore.<br/><br/>On this side the banks were less woody, but clumps of trees,<br/>here and there, added to the picturesqueness of the country. Lake<br/>Grant was viewed from thence in all its extent, and no breath<br/>disturbed the surface of its waters. Top, in beating the bushes,<br/>put up flocks of birds of different kinds, which Gideon Spilett and<br/>Herbert saluted with arrows. One was hit by the lad, and fell into<br/>some marshy grass. Top rushed forward, and brought a beautiful<br/>swimming bird, of a slate color, short beak, very developed frontal<br/>plate, and wings edged with white. It was a "coot," the size of a<br/>large partridge, belonging to the group of macrodactyls which form<br/>the transition between the order of wading birds and that of<br/>palmipeds. Sorry game, in truth, and its flavor is far from<br/>pleasant. But Top was not so particular in these things as his<br/>masters, and it was agreed that the coot should be for his<br/>supper.<br/><br/>The settlers were now following the eastern bank of the lake,<br/>and they would not be long in reaching the part which they already<br/>knew. The engineer was much surprised at not seeing any indication<br/>of the discharge of water. The reporter and the sailor talked with<br/>him, and he could not conceal his astonishment.<br/><br/>At this moment Top, who had been very quiet till then, gave<br/>signs of agitation. The intelligent animal went backwards and<br/>forwards on the shore, stopped suddenly, and looked at the water,<br/>one paw raised, as if he was pointing at some invisible game; then<br/>he barked furiously, and was suddenly silent.<br/><br/>Neither Cyrus Harding nor his companions had at first paid any<br/>attention to Top's behavior; but the dog's barking soon became so<br/>frequent that the engineer noticed it.<br/><br/>"What is there, Top?" he asked.<br/><br/>The dog bounded towards his master, seeming to be very uneasy,<br/>and then rushed again towards the bank. Then, all at once, he<br/>plunged into the lake.<br/><br/>"Here, Top!" cried Cyrus Harding, who did not like his dog to<br/>venture into the treacherous water.<br/>
