"Well!" said Pencroft. "When that fellow is outside, and feels
the fresh air, he will be off as fast as his legs can carry
him!"

"I do not think so," returned Harding.

"Let us try," said Spilett.

"We will try," replied the engineer.

This was on the 30th of October, and consequently the castaway
of Tabor Island had been a prisoner in Granite House for nine days.
It was warm, and a bright sun darted its rays on the island. Cyrus
Harding and Pencroft went to the room occupied by the stranger, who
was found lying near the window and gazing at the sky.

"Come, my friend," said the engineer to him.

The stranger rose immediately. His eyes were fixed on Cyrus
Harding, and he followed him, while the sailor marched behind them,
little confident as to the result of the experiment.

Arrived at the door, Harding and Pencroft made him take his
place in the lift, while Neb, Herbert, and Gideon Spilett waited
for them before Granite House. The lift descended, and in a few
moments all were united on the beach.

The settlers went a short distance from the stranger, so as to
leave him at liberty.

He then made a few steps toward the sea, and his look brightened
with extreme animation, but he did not make the slightest attempt
to escape. He was gazing at the little waves which, broken by the
islet, rippled on the sand.

"This is only the sea," observed Gideon Spilett, "and possibly
it does not inspire him with any wish to escape!"
