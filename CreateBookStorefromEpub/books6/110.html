<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>15<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>The next day, the 17th of April, the sailor's first words were<br/>addressed to Gideon Spilett.<br/><br/>"Well, sir," he asked, "what shall we do to-day?"<br/><br/>"What the captain pleases," replied the reporter.<br/><br/>Till then the engineer's companions had been brickmakers and<br/>potters, now they were to become metallurgists.<br/><br/>The day before, after breakfast, they had explored as far as the<br/>point of Mandible Cape, seven miles distant from the Chimneys.<br/>There, the long series of downs ended, and the soil had a volcanic<br/>appearance. There were no longer high cliffs as at Prospect<br/>Heights, but a strange and capricious border which surrounded the<br/>narrow gulf between the two capes, formed of mineral matter, thrown<br/>up by the volcano. Arrived at this point the settlers retraced<br/>their steps, and at nightfall entered the Chimneys; but they did<br/>not sleep before the question of knowing whether they could think<br/>of leaving Lincoln Island or not was definitely settled.<br/><br/>The twelve hundred miles which separated the island from the<br/>Pomoutous Island was a considerable distance. A boat could not<br/>cross it, especially at the approach of the bad season. Pencroft<br/>had expressly declared this. Now, to construct a simple boat even<br/>with the necessary tools, was a difficult work, and the colonists<br/>not having tools they must begin by making hammers, axes, adzes,<br/>saws, augers, planes, etc., which would take some time. It was<br/>decided, therefore, that they would winter at Lincoln Island, and<br/>that they would look for a more comfortable dwelling than the<br/>Chimneys, in which to pass the winter months.<br/><br/>
