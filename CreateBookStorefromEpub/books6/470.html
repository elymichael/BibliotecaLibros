As the "Bonadventure" no longer existed, six months at least<br/>would be required for the construction of a new vessel. Now winter<br/>was approaching, and the voyage would not be made before the<br/>following spring.<br/><br/>"We have time to get everything ready for the fine season,"<br/>remarked the engineer, who was consulting with Pencroft about these<br/>matters. "I think, therefore, my friend, that since we have to<br/>rebuild our vessel it will be best to give her larger dimensions.<br/>The arrival of the Scotch yacht at Tabor Island is very uncertain.<br/>It may even be that, having arrived several months ago, she has<br/>again sailed after having vainly searched for some trace of Ayrton.<br/>Will it not then he best to build a ship which, if necessary, could<br/>take us either to the Polynesian Archipelago or to New Zealand?<br/>What do you think?"<br/><br/>"I think, captain," answered the sailor; "I think that you are<br/>as capable of building a large vessel as a small one. Neither the<br/>wood nor the tools are wanting. It is only a question of time."<br/><br/>"And how many months would be required to build a vessel of from<br/>250 to 300 tons?" asked Harding.<br/><br/>"Seven or eight months at least," replied Pencroft. "But it must<br/>not be forgotten that winter is drawing near, and that in severe<br/>frost wood is difficult to work. We must calculate on several weeks<br/>delay, and if our vessel is ready by next November we may think<br/>ourselves very lucky."<br/><br/>"Well," replied Cyrus Harding, "that will be exactly the most<br/>favorable time for undertaking a voyage of any importance, either<br/>to Tabor Island or to a more distant land."<br/><br/>"So it will, captain," answered the sailor. "Make out your plans<br/>then; the workmen are ready, and I imagine that Ayrton can lend us<br/>a good helping hand."<br/><br/>The colonists, having been consulted, approved the engineer's<br/>plan, and it was, indeed, the best thing to be done. It is true<br/>that the construction of a ship of from two to three hundred tons<br/>would be great labor, but the colonists had confidence in<br/>themselves, justified by their previous success.<br/><br/>Cyrus Harding then busied himself in drawing the plan of the<br/>vessel and making the model. During this time his companions<br/>employed themselves in felling and carting trees to furnish the<br/>ribs, timbers, and planks. The forest of the Far West supplied the<br/>best oaks and elms. They took advantage of the opening already made<br/>on their last excursion to form a practicable road, which they<br/>named the Far West Road, and the trees were carried to the<br/>Chimneys, where the dockyard was established. As to the road in<br/>question, the choice of trees had rendered its direction somewhat<br/>capricious, but at the same time it facilitated the access to a<br/>large part of the Serpentine Peninsula.<br/><br/>It was important that the trees should be quickly felled and cut<br/>up, for they could not be used while yet green, and some time was<br/>necessary to allow them to get seasoned. The carpenters, therefore,<br/>worked vigorously during the month of April, which was troubled<br/>only by a few equinoctial gales of some violence. Master Jup aided<br/>them dexterously, either by climbing to the top of a tree to fasten<br/>the ropes or by lending his stout shoulders to carry the lopped<br/>trunks.<br/><br/>All this timber was piled up under a large shed, built near the<br/>Chimneys, and there awaited the time for use.<br/>
