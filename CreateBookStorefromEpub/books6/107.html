"I would rather be here than in the hands of the Southerners,"<br/>cried the sailor, "especially since the captain has been kind<br/>enough to come and join us again."<br/><br/>"So would I, truly!" replied the reporter. "Besides, what do we<br/>want? Nothing."<br/><br/>"If that is not—everything!" replied Pencroft, laughing and<br/>shrugging his shoulders. "But, some day or other, we shall find<br/>means of going away!"<br/><br/>"Sooner, perhaps, than you imagine, my friends," remarked the<br/>engineer, "if Lincoln Island is but a medium distance from an<br/>inhabited island, or from a continent. We shall know in an hour. I<br/>have not a map of the Pacific, but my memory has preserved a very<br/>clear recollection of its southern part. The latitude which I<br/>obtained yesterday placed New Zealand to the west of Lincoln<br/>Island, and the coast of Chile to the east. But between these two<br/>countries, there is a distance of at least six thousand miles. It<br/>has, therefore, to be determined what point in this great space the<br/>island occupies, and this the longitude will give us presently,<br/>with a sufficient approximation, I hope."<br/><br/>"Is not the archipelago of the Pomoutous the nearest point to us<br/>in latitude?" asked Herbert.<br/><br/>"Yes," replied the engineer, "but the distance which separates<br/>us from it is more than twelve hundred miles."<br/><br/>"And that way?" asked Neb, who followed the conversation with<br/>extreme interest, pointing to the south.<br/><br/>"That way, nothing," replied Pencroft.<br/><br/>"Nothing, indeed," added the engineer.<br/><br/>"Well, Cyrus," asked the reporter, "if Lincoln Island is not<br/>more than two or three thousand miles from New Zealand or<br/>Chile?"<br/><br/>"Well," replied the engineer, "instead of building a house we<br/>will build a boat, and Master Pencroft shall be put in<br/>command—"<br/>
