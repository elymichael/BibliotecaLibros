"Your idea is good, Pencroft," replied the engineer, "but we
cannot wait for that. It would take at least a month to build a
boat."

"Yes, a real boat," replied the sailor; "but we do not want one
for a sea voyage, and in five days at the most, I will undertake to
construct a canoe fit to navigate the Mercy."

"Five days," cried Neb, "to build a boat?"

"Yes, Neb; a boat in the Indian fashion."

"Of wood?" asked the Negro, looking still unconvinced.

"Of wood," replied Pencroft, "of rather of bark. I repeat,
captain, that in five days the work will be finished!"

"In five days, then, be it," replied the engineer.

"But till that time we must be very watchful," said Herbert.

"Very watchful indeed, my friends," replied Harding; "and I beg
you to confine your hunting excursions to the neighborhood of
Granite House."

The dinner ended less gaily than Pencroft had hoped.
