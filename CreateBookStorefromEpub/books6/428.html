<br/>"Do you hope, then, Pencroft, that the villains have spared<br/>him?" asked Gideon Spilett.<br/><br/>"Yes, if they had any interest in doing so."<br/><br/>"What! you suppose that Ayrton finding his old companions,<br/>forgetting all that he owes us—"<br/><br/>"Who knows?" answered the sailor, who did not hazard this<br/>shameful supposition without hesitating.<br/><br/>"Pencroft," said Harding, taking the sailor's arm, "that is a<br/>wicked idea of yours, and you will distress me much if you persist<br/>in speaking thus. I will answer for Ayrton's fidelity."<br/><br/>"And I also," added the reporter quickly.<br/><br/>"Yes, yes, captain, I was wrong," replied Pencroft; "it was a<br/>wicked idea indeed that I had, and nothing justifies it.

But his<br/>convalescence is progressing, and if he continues to gain strength,<br/>in eight days from now— well, we shall see."<br/><br/>Eight days! That would put off the return to Granite House until<br/>the first days of December. At this time two months of spring had<br/>already passed. The weather was fine, and the heat began to be<br/>great. The forests of the island were in full leaf, and the time<br/>was approaching when the usual crops ought to be gathered. The<br/>return to the plateau of Prospect Heights would, therefore, be<br/>followed by extensive agricultural labors, interrupted only by the<br/>projected expedition through the island.<br/><br/>
