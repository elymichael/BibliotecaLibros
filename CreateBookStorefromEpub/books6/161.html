Besides, there was no way of stopping it, if they had wished to<br/>do so.<br/><br/>How grateful the inhabitants of Granite House then were to<br/>Heaven for having prepared for them this solid and immovable<br/>retreat! Cyrus Harding had also his legitimate share of thanks, but<br/>after all, it was Nature who had hollowed out this vast cavern, and<br/>he had only discovered it. There all were in safety, and the<br/>tempest could not reach them. If they had constructed a house of<br/>bricks and wood on Prospect Heights, it certainly would not have<br/>resisted the fury of this storm. As to the Chimneys, it must have<br/>been absolutely uninhabitable, for the sea, passing over the islet,<br/>would beat furiously against it. But here, in Granite House, in the<br/>middle of a solid mass, over which neither the sea nor air had any<br/>influence, there was nothing to fear.<br/><br/>During these days of seclusion the settlers did not remain<br/>inactive.<br/><br/>There was no want of wood, cut up into planks, in the storeroom,<br/>and little by little they completed their furnishing; constructing<br/>the most solid of tables and chairs, for material was not spared.<br/>Neb and Pencroft were very proud of this rather heavy furniture,<br/>which they would not have changed on any account.<br/><br/>Then the carpenters became basket-makers, and they did not<br/>succeed badly in this new manufacture. At the point of the lake<br/>which projected to the north, they had discovered an osier-bed in<br/>which grew a large number of purple osiers. Before the rainy<br/>season, Pencroft and Herbert had cut down these useful shrubs, and<br/>their branches, well prepared, could now be effectively employed.<br/>The first attempts were somewhat crude, but in consequence of the<br/>cleverness and intelligence of the workmen, by consulting, and<br/>recalling the models which they had seen, and by emulating each<br/>other, the possessions of the colony were soon increased by several<br/>baskets of different sizes. The storeroom was provided with them,<br/>and in special baskets Neb placed his collection of rhizomes,<br/>stone-pine almonds, etc.<br/><br/>During the last week of the month of August the weather<br/>moderated again. The temperature fell a little, and the tempest<br/>abated. The colonists sallied out directly. There was certainly two<br/>feet of snow on the shore, but they were able to walk without much<br/>difficulty on the hardened surface. Cyrus Harding and his<br/>companions climbed Prospect Heights.<br/><br/>What a change! The woods, which they had left green, especially<br/>in the part at which the firs predominated, had disappeared under a<br/>uniform color. All was white, from the summit of Mount Franklin to<br/>the shore, the forests, the plains, the lake, the river. The waters<br/>of the Mercy flowed under a roof of ice, which, at each rising and<br/>ebbing of the tide, broke up with loud crashes. Numerous birds<br/>fluttered over the frozen surface of the lake. Ducks and snipe,<br/>teal and guillemots were assembled in thousands. The rocks among<br/>which the cascade flowed were bristling with icicles. One might<br/>have said that the water escaped by a monstrous gargoyle, shaped<br/>with all the imagination of an artist of the Renaissance. As to the<br/>damage caused by the storm in the forest, that could not as yet be<br/>ascertained; they would have to wait till the snowy covering was<br/>dissipated.<br/><br/>Gideon Spilett, Pencroft, and Herbert did not miss this<br/>opportunity of going to visit their traps. They did not find them<br/>easily, under the snow with which they were covered. They had also<br/>to be careful not to fall into one or other of them, which would<br/>have been both dangerous and humiliating; to be taken in their own<br/>snares! But happily they avoided this unpleasantness, and found<br/>their traps perfectly intact. No animal had fallen into them, and<br/>yet the footprints in the neighborhood were very numerous, among<br/>others, certain very clear marks of claws. Herbert did not hesitate<br/>to affirm that some animal of the feline species had passed there,<br/>which justified the engineer's opinion that dangerous beasts<br/>existed in Lincoln Island. These animals doubtless generally lived<br/>in the forests of the Far West, but pressed by hunger, they had<br/>ventured as far as Prospect Heights. Perhaps they had smelled out<br/>the inhabitants of Granite House. "Now, what are these feline<br/>creatures?" asked Pencroft. "They are tigers," replied Herbert. "I<br/>thought those beasts were only found in hot countries?"<br/><br/>"On the new continent," replied the lad, "they are found from<br/>Mexico to the Pampas of Buenos Aires. Now, as Lincoln Island is<br/>nearly under the same latitude as the provinces of La Plata, it is<br/>not surprising that tigers are to be met with in it."<br/><br/>"Well, we must look out for them," replied Pencroft.<br/><br/>However, the snow soon disappeared, quickly dissolving under the<br/>influence of the rising temperature. Rain fell, and the sheet of<br/>white soon vanished. Notwithstanding the bad weather, the settlers<br/>renewed their stores of different things, stone-pine almonds,<br/>rhizomes, syrup from the maple-tree, for the vegetable part;<br/>rabbits from the warren, agouties, and kangaroos for the animal<br/>part. This necessitated several excursions into the forest, and<br/>they found that a great number of trees had been blown down by the<br/>last hurricane. Pencroft and Neb also pushed with the cart as far<br/>as the vein of coal, and brought back several tons of fuel. They<br/>saw in passing that the pottery kiln had been severely damaged by<br/>the wind, at least six feet of it having been blown off.<br/>
