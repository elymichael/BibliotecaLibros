It had indeed been a narrow escape for Cyrus Harding!

Neb then recounted what had happened. The day before, after
having left the Chimneys at daybreak, he had ascended the coast in
a northerly direction, and had reached that part of the shore which
he had already visited.

There, without any hope he acknowledged, Neb had searched the
beach, among the rocks, on the sand, for the smallest trace to
guide him. He examined particularly that part of the beach which
was not covered by the high tide, for near the sea the water would
have obliterated all marks. Neb did not expect to find his master
living. It was for a corpse that he searched, a corpse which he
wished to bury with his own hands!

He sought long in vain. This desert coast appeared never to have
been visited by a human creature. The shells, those which the sea
had not reached, and which might be met with by millions above
high-water mark, were untouched. Not a shell was broken.

Neb then resolved to walk along the beach for some miles. It was
possible that the waves had carried the body to quite a distant
point. When a corpse floats a little distance from a low shore, it
rarely happens that the tide does not throw it up, sooner or later.
This Neb knew, and he wished to see his master again for the last
time.

"I went along the coast for another two miles, carefully
examining the beach, both at high and low water, and I had
despaired of finding anything, when yesterday, above five in the
evening, I saw footprints on the sand."

"Footprints?" exclaimed Pencroft.

"Yes!" replied Neb.

"Did these footprints begin at the water's edge?" asked the
reporter.

"No," replied Neb, "only above high-water mark, for the others
must have been washed out by the tide."
