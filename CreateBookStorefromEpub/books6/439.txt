Gideon Spilett had not left Herbert, who, it was only too
certain, was now seized by an intermittent fever, and this fever
must be cured at any cost before it should assume a more serious
aspect.

"And in order to cure it," said Spilett to Cyrus Harding, "we
need a febrifuge."

"A febrifugeâ€”" answered the engineer. "We have neither Peruvian
bark, nor sulphate of quinine."

"No," said Gideon Spilett, "but there are willows on the border
of the lake, and the bark of the willow might, perhaps, prove to be
a substitute for quinine."

"Let us try it without losing a moment," replied Cyrus
Harding.

The bark of the willow has, indeed, been justly considered as a
succedaneum for Peruvian bark, as has also that of the
horse-chestnut tree, the leaf of the holly, the snake-root, etc. It
was evidently necessary to make trial of this substance, although
not so valuable as Peruvian bark, and to employ it in its natural
state, since they had no means for extracting its essence.

Cyrus Harding went himself to cut from the trunk of a species of
black willow, a few pieces of bark; he brought them back to Granite
House, and reduced them to a powder, which was administered that
same evening to Herbert.

The night passed without any important change. Herbert was
somewhat delirious, but the fever did not reappear in the night,
and did not return either during the following day.

Pencroft again began to hope. Gideon Spilett said nothing. It
might be that the fever was not quotidian, but tertian, and that it
would return next day. Therefore, he awaited the next day with the
greatest anxiety.

It might have been remarked besides that during this period
Herbert remained utterly prostrate, his head weak and giddy.
Another symptom alarmed the reporter to the highest degree.
Herbert's liver became congested, and soon a more intense delirium
showed that his brain was also affected.

Gideon Spilett was overwhelmed by this new complication. He took
the engineer aside.
