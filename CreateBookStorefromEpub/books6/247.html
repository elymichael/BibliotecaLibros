<br/>On the 30th of April, the two sportsmen were in the depth of the<br/>Far West, when the reporter, preceding Herbert a few paces, arrived<br/>in a sort of clearing, into which the trees more sparsely scattered<br/>had permitted a few rays to penetrate. Gideon Spilett was at first<br/>surprised at the odor which exhaled from certain plants with<br/>straight stalks, round and branchy, bearing grape-like clusters of<br/>flowers and very small berries. The reporter broke off one or two<br/>of these stalks and returned to the lad, to whom he said,â€”<br/><br/>"What can this be, Herbert?"<br/><br/>"Well, Mr. Spilett," said Herbert, "this is a treasure which<br/>will secure you Pencroft's gratitude forever."<br/><br/>"Is it tobacco?"<br/><br/>"Yes, and though it may not be of the first quality, it is none<br/>the less tobacco!"<br/><br/>"Oh, good old Pencroft! Won't he be pleased! But we must not let<br/>him smoke it all, he must give us our share."<br/><br/>"Ah! an idea occurs to me, Mr, Spilett," replied Herbert. "Don't<br/>let us say anything to Pencroft yet; we will prepare these leaves,<br/>and one fine day we will present him with a pipe already<br/>filled!"<br/><br/>"All right, Herbert, and on that day our worthy companion will<br/>have nothing left to wish for in this world."<br/><br/>The reporter and the lad secured a good store of the precious<br/>plant, and then returned to Granite House, where they smuggled it<br/>in with as much precaution as if Pencroft had been the most<br/>vigilant and severe of custom- house officers.<br/><br/>Cyrus Harding and Neb were taken into confidence, and the sailor<br/>suspected nothing during the whole time, necessarily somewhat long,<br/>which was required in order to dry the small leaves, chop them up,<br/>and subject them to a certain torrefaction on hot stones. This took<br/>two months; but all these manipulations were successfully carried<br/>on unknown to Pencroft, for, occupied with the construction of his<br/>boat, he only returned to Granite House at the hour of rest.<br/><br/>
