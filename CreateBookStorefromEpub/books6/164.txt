In consequence and in view of these future establishments, it
became of much importance that they should penetrate into all the
yet unknown parts of Lincoln Island, that is to say, through that
thick forest which extended on the right bank of the Mercy, from
its mouth to the extremity of the Serpentine Peninsula, as well as
on the whole of its western side. But this needed settled weather,
and a month must pass before this exploration could be profitably
undertaken.

They therefore waited with some impatience, when an incident
occurred which increased the desire the settlers had to visit the
whole of their domain.

It was the 24th of October. On this day, Pencroft had gone to
visit his traps, which he always kept properly baited. In one of
them he found three animals which would be very welcome for the
larder. They were a female peccary and her two young ones.

Pencroft then returned to Granite House, enchanted with his
capture, and, as usual, he made a great show of his game.

"Come, we shall have a grand feast, captain!" he exclaimed. "And
you too, Mr. Spilett, you will eat some!"

"I shall be very happy," replied the reporter; "but what is it
that I am going to eat?"

"Suckling-pig."

"Oh, indeed, suckling-pig, Pencroft? To hear you, I thought that
you were bringing back a young partridge stuffed with
truffles!"

"What?" cried Pencroft. "Do you mean to say that you turn up
your nose at suckling-pig?'

"No," replied Gideon Spilett, without showing any enthusiasm;
"provided one doesn't eat too much"
