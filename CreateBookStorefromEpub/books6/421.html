"What o'clock is it?" asked Gideon Spilett.<br/><br/>"Ten."<br/><br/>"In an hour he may be here. We will watch for his return."<br/><br/>The gate of the corral was closed. The engineer and the reporter<br/>re-entered the house. Herbert was still in a sleep. Pencroft kept<br/>the compresser always wet. Spilett, seeing there was nothing he<br/>could do at that moment, busied himself in preparing some<br/>nourishment, while attentively watching that part of the enclosure<br/>against the hill, at which an attack might be expected.<br/><br/>The settlers awaited Top's return with much anxiety. A little<br/>before eleven o'clock, Cyrus Harding and the reporter, rifle in<br/>hand, were behind the gate, ready to open it at the first bark of<br/>their dog.<br/><br/>They did not doubt that if Top had arrived safely at Granite<br/>House, Neb would have sent him back immediately.<br/><br/>They had both been there for about ten minutes, when a report<br/>was heard, followed by repeated barks.<br/><br/>The engineer opened the gate, and seeing smoke a hundred feet<br/>off in the wood, he fired in that direction.<br/><br/>Almost immediately Top bounded into the corral, and the gate was<br/>quickly shut.<br/><br/>"Top, Top!" exclaimed the engineer, taking the dog's great<br/>honest head between his hands.<br/><br/>A note was fastened to his neck, and Cyrus Harding read these<br/>words, traced in Neb's large writing:â€”"No pirates in the<br/>neighborhood of Granite House. I will not stir. Poor Mr.<br/>Herbert!"<br/>
