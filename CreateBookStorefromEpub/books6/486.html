The wire was there fastened to the rock.<br/><br/>"Forward!" said Harding.<br/><br/>And the two oars, plunging into the dark waters, urged the boat<br/>onwards.<br/><br/>On they went for another quarter of an hour, and a distance of<br/>half-a- mile must have been cleared from the mouth of the cave,<br/>when Harding's voice was again heard.<br/><br/>"Stop!" said he.<br/><br/>The boat stopped, and the colonists perceived a bright light<br/>illuminating the vast cavern, so deeply excavated in the bowels of<br/>the island, of which nothing had ever led them to suspect the<br/>existence.<br/><br/>At a height of a hundred feet rose the vaulted roof, supported<br/>on basalt shafts. Irregular arches, strange moldings, appeared on<br/>the columns erected by nature in thousands from the first epochs of<br/>the formation of the globe. The basalt pillars, fitted one into the<br/>other, measured from forty to fifty feet in height, and the water,<br/>calm in spite of the tumult outside, washed their base. The<br/>brilliant focus of light, pointed out by the engineer, touched<br/>every point of rocks, and flooded the walls with light.<br/><br/>By reflection the water reproduced the brilliant sparkles, so<br/>that the boat appeared to be floating between two glittering zones.<br/>They could not be mistaken in the nature of the irradiation thrown<br/>from the glowing nucleus, whose clear rays were shattered by all<br/>the angles, all the projections of the cavern. This light proceeded<br/>from an electric source, and its white color betrayed its origin.<br/>It was the sun of this cave, and it filled it entirely.<br/><br/>At a sign from Cyrus Harding the oars again plunged into the<br/>water, causing a regular shower of gems, and the boat was urged<br/>forward towards the light, which was now not more than half a<br/>cable's length distant.<br/><br/>At this place the breadth of the sheet of water measured nearly<br/>350 feet, and beyond the dazzling center could be seen an enormous<br/>basaltic wall, blocking up any issue on that side. The cavern<br/>widened here considerably, the sea forming a little lake. But the<br/>roof, the side walls, the end cliff, all the prisms, all the peaks,<br/>were flooded with the electric fluid, so that the brilliancy<br/>belonged to them, and as if the light issued from them.<br/><br/>In the center of the lake a long cigar-shaped object floated on<br/>the surface of the water, silent, motionless. The brilliancy which<br/>issued from it escaped from its sides as from two kilns heated to a<br/>white heat. This apparatus, similar in shape to an enormous whale,<br/>was about 250 feet long, and rose about ten or twelve above the<br/>water.<br/>
