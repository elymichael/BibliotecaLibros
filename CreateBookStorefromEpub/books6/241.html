<br/>The next day the settlers went to collect some, and returned to<br/>Granite House with an ample supply of cycas stems. The engineer<br/>constructed a press, with which to extract the mucilaginous juice<br/>mingled with the fecula, and he obtained a large quantity of flour,<br/>which Neb soon transformed into cakes and puddings. This was not<br/>quite real wheaten bread, but it was very like it.<br/><br/>Now, too, the onager, the goats, and the sheep in the corral<br/>furnished daily the milk necessary to the colony. The cart, or<br/>rather a sort of light carriole which had replaced it, made<br/>frequent journeys to the corral, and when it was Pencroft's turn to<br/>go he took Jup, and let him drive, and Jup, cracking his whip,<br/>acquitted himself with his customary intelligence.<br/><br/>Everything prospered, as well in the corral as in Granite House,<br/>and certainly the settlers, if it had not been that they were so<br/>far from their native land, had no reason to complain. They were so<br/>well suited to this life, and were, besides, so accustomed to the<br/>island, that they could not have left its hospitable soil without<br/>regret!<br/><br/>And yet so deeply is the love of his country implanted in the<br/>heart of man, that if a ship had unexpectedly come in sight of the<br/>island, the colonists would have made signals, would have attracted<br/>her attention, and would have departed!<br/><br/>It was the 1st of April, a Sunday, Easter Day, which Harding and<br/>his companions sanctified by rest and prayer. The day was fine,<br/>such as an October day in the Northern Hemisphere might be.<br/><br/>All, towards the evening after dinner, were seated under the<br/>veranda on the edge of Prospect Heights, and they were watching the<br/>darkness creeping up from the horizon. Some cups of the infusion of<br/>elder-berries, which took the place of coffee, had been served by<br/>Neb. They were speaking of the island and of its isolated situation<br/>in the Pacific, which led Gideon Spilett to say,â€”<br/><br/>"My dear Cyrus, have you ever, since you possessed the sextant<br/>found in the case, again taken the position of our island?"<br/><br/>"No," replied the engineer.<br/><br/>"But it would perhaps be a good thing to do it with this<br/>instrument, which is more perfect than that which you before<br/>used."<br/><br/>"What is the good?" said Pencroft. "The island is quite<br/>comfortable where it is!"<br/><br/>
