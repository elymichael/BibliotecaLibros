<br/>"Jup, some soup!"<br/><br/>"Jup, a little agouti!"<br/><br/>"Jup, a plate!"<br/><br/>"Jup! Good Jup! Honest Jup!"<br/><br/>Nothing was heard but that, and Jup without ever being<br/>disconcerted, replied to every one, watched for everything, and he<br/>shook his head in a knowing way when Pencroft, referring to his<br/>joke of the first day, said to him,â€”<br/><br/>"Decidedly, Jup, your wages must be doubled."<br/><br/>It is useless to say that the orang was now thoroughly<br/>domesticated at Granite House, and that he often accompanied his<br/>masters to the forest without showing any wish to leave them. It<br/>was most amusing to see him walking with a stick which Pencroft had<br/>given him, and which he carried on his shoulder like a gun. If they<br/>wished to gather some fruit from the summit of a tree, how quickly<br/>he climbed for it. If the wheel of the cart stuck in the mud, with<br/>what energy did Jup with a single heave of his shoulder put it<br/>right again.<br/><br/>"What a jolly fellow he is!" cried Pencroft often. "If he was as<br/>mischievous as he is good, there would be no doing anything with<br/>him!"<br/><br/>It was towards the end of January the colonists began their<br/>labors in the center of the island. It had been decided that a<br/>corral should be established near the sources of the Red Creek, at<br/>the foot of Mount Franklin, destined to contain the ruminants,<br/>whose presence would have been troublesome at Granite House, and<br/>especially for the musmons, who were to supply the wool for the<br/>settlers' winter garments.<br/><br/>Each morning, the colony, sometimes entire, but more often<br/>represented only by Harding, Herbert, and Pencroft, proceeded to<br/>the sources of the Creek, a distance of not more than five miles,<br/>by the newly beaten road to which the name of Corral Road had been<br/>given.<br/><br/>
