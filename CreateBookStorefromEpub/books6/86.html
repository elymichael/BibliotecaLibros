<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>12<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>They now began the descent of the mountain. Climbing down the<br/>crater, they went round the cone and reached their encampment of<br/>the previous night. Pencroft thought it must be breakfast-time, and<br/>the watches of the reporter and engineer were therefore consulted<br/>to find out the hour.<br/><br/>That of Gideon Spilett had been preserved from the sea-water, as<br/>he had been thrown at once on the sand out of reach of the waves.<br/>It was an instrument of excellent quality, a perfect pocket<br/>chronometer, which the reporter had not forgotten to wind up<br/>carefully every day.<br/><br/>As to the engineer's watch, it, of course, had stopped during<br/>the time which he had passed on the downs.<br/><br/>The engineer now wound it up, and ascertaining by the height of<br/>the sun that it must be about nine o'clock in the morning, he put<br/>his watch at that hour.<br/><br/>"No, my dear Spilett, wait. You have kept the Richmond time,<br/>have you not?"<br/><br/>"Yes, Cyrus."<br/><br/>
