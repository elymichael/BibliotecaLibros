"Why so?" asked the reporter.<br/><br/>"Because the document would then have spoken of two castaways,"<br/>replied Harding, "and it mentioned only one."<br/><br/>Herbert then in a few words related the incidents of the voyage,<br/>and dwelt on the curious fact of the sort of passing gleam in the<br/>prisoner's mind, when for an instant in the height of the storm he<br/>had become a sailor.<br/><br/>"Well, Herbert," replied the engineer, "you are right to attach<br/>great importance to this fact. The unfortunate man cannot be<br/>incurable, and despair has made him what he is; but here he will<br/>find his fellow-men, and since there is still a soul in him, this<br/>soul we shall save!"<br/><br/>The castaway of Tabor Island, to the great pity of the engineer<br/>and the great astonishment of Neb, was then brought from the cabin<br/>which he occupied in the fore part of the "Bonadventure"; when once<br/>on land he manifested a wish to run away.<br/><br/>But Cyrus Harding approaching, placed his hand on his shoulder<br/>with a gesture full of authority, and looked at him with infinite<br/>tenderness. Immediately the unhappy man, submitting to a superior<br/>will, gradually became calm, his eyes fell, his head bent, and he<br/>made no more resistance.<br/><br/>"Poor fellow!" murmured the engineer.<br/><br/>Cyrus Harding had attentively observed him. To judge by his<br/>appearance this miserable being had no longer anything human about<br/>him, and yet Harding, as had the reporter already, observed in his<br/>look an indefinable trace of intelligence.<br/><br/>It was decided that the castaway, or rather the stranger as he<br/>was thenceforth termed by his companions, should live in one of the<br/>rooms of Granite House, from which, however, he could not escape.<br/>He was led there without difficulty, and with careful attention, it<br/>might, perhaps, be hoped that some day he would be a companion to<br/>the settlers in Lincoln Island.<br/><br/>Cyrus Harding, during breakfast, which Neb had hastened to<br/>prepare, as the reporter, Herbert, and Pencroft were dying of<br/>hunger, heard in detail all the incidents which had marked the<br/>voyage of exploration to the islet. He agreed with his friends on<br/>this point, that the stranger must be either English or American,<br/>the name Britannia leading them to suppose this, and, besides,<br/>through the bushy beard, and under the shaggy, matted hair, the<br/>engineer thought he could recognize the characteristic features of<br/>the Anglo-Saxon.<br/><br/>"But, by the bye," said Gideon Spilett, addressing Herbert, "you<br/>never told us how you met this savage, and we know nothing, except<br/>that you would have been strangled, if we had not happened to come<br/>up in time to help you!"<br/>
