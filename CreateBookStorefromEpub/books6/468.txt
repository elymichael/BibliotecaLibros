Their investigations were then directed to the downs. They
carefully examined the high lava-cliffs of Shark Gulf from the base
to the crest, although it was extremely difficult to reach even the
level of the gulf. No one!â€”nothing!

Indeed, in these three words was summed up so much fatigue
uselessly expended, so much energy producing no results, that
somewhat of anger mingled with the discomfiture of Cyrus Harding
and his companions.

It was now time to think of returning, for these researches
could not be prolonged indefinitely. The colonists were certainly
right in believing that the mysterious being did not reside on the
surface of the island, and the wildest fancies haunted their
excited imaginations. Pencroft and Neb, particularly, were not
contented with the mystery, but allowed their imaginations to
wander into the domain of the supernatural.

On the 25th of February the colonists re-entered Granite House,
and by means of the double cord, carried by an arrow to the
threshold of the door, they re-established communication between
their habitation and the ground.

A month later they commemorated, on the 25th of March, the third
anniversary of their arrival on Lincoln Island.
