The vessel was securely moored, so that there should be no<br/>danger of her being carried away by the receding tide; then<br/>Pencroft and his companions, well armed, ascended the shore, so as<br/>to gain an elevation of about two hundred and fifty or three<br/>hundred feet which rose at a distance of half a mile.<br/><br/>"From the summit of that hill," said Spilett, "we can no doubt<br/>obtain a complete view of the island, which will greatly facilitate<br/>our search."<br/><br/>"So as to do here," replied Herbert, "that which Captain Harding<br/>did the very first thing on Lincoln Island, by climbing Mount<br/>Franklin."<br/><br/>"Exactly so," answered the reporter, "and it is the best<br/>plan."<br/><br/>While thus talking the explorers had advanced along a clearing<br/>which terminated at the foot of the hill. Flocks of rock-pigeons<br/>and sea- swallows, similar to those of Lincoln Island, fluttered<br/>around them. Under the woods which skirted the glade on the left<br/>they could hear the bushes rustling and see the grass waving, which<br/>indicated the presence of timid animals, but still nothing to show<br/>that the island was inhabited.<br/><br/>Arrived at the foot of the hill, Pencroft, Spilett, and Herbert<br/>climbed it in a few minutes, and gazed anxiously round the<br/>horizon.<br/><br/>They were on an islet, which did not measure more than six miles<br/>in circumference, its shape not much bordered by capes or<br/>promontories, bays or creeks, being a lengthened oval. All around,<br/>the lonely sea extended to the limits of the horizon. No land nor<br/>even a sail was in sight.<br/><br/>This woody islet did not offer the varied aspects of Lincoln<br/>Island, arid and wild in one part, but fertile and rich in the<br/>other. On the contrary this was a uniform mass of verdure, out of<br/>which rose two or three hills of no great height. Obliquely to the<br/>oval of the island ran a stream through a wide meadow falling into<br/>the sea on the west by a narrow mouth.<br/><br/>"The domain is limited," said Herbert.<br/><br/>"Yes," rejoined Pencroft: "It would have been too small for<br/>us."<br/><br/>"And moreover," said the reporter, "it appears to be<br/>uninhabited."<br/>
