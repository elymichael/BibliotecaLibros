"You have, four or five miles from here, a corral for your
domesticated animals. These animals need to be taken care of. Will
you allow me to live there with them?"

Cyrus Harding gazed at the unfortunate man for a few moments
with a feeling of deep commiseration; then,â€”

"My friend," said he, "the corral has only stables hardly fit
for animals."

"It will be good enough for me, sir."

"My friend," answered Harding, "we will not constrain you in
anything. You wish to live at the corral, so be it. You will,
however, be always welcome at Granite House. But since you wish to
live at the corral we will make the necessary arrangements for your
being comfortably established there."

"Never mind that, I shall do very well."

"My friend," answered Harding, who always intentionally made use
of this cordial appellation, "you must let us judge what it will be
best to do in this respect."

"Thank you, sir," replied the stranger as he withdrew.

The engineer then made known to his companions the proposal
which had been made to him, and it was agreed that they should
build a wooden house at the corral, which they would make as
comfortable as possible.

That very day the colonists repaired to the corral with the
necessary tools, and a week had not passed before the house was
ready to receive its tenant. It was built about twenty feet from
the sheds, and from there it was easy to overlook the flock of
sheep, which then numbered more than eighty. Some furniture, a bed,
table, bench, cupboard, and chest were manufactured, and a gun,
ammunition, and tools were carried to the corral.
