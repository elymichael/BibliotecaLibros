The engineer, the meshes of the net having given way, had been
carried off by a wave. His dog also had disappeared. The faithful
animal had voluntarily leaped out to help his master. "Forward,"
cried the reporter; and all four, Spilett, Herbert, Pencroft, and
Neb, forgetting their fatigue, began their search. Poor Neb shed
bitter tears, giving way to despair at the thought of having lost
the only being he loved on earth.

Only two minutes had passed from the time when Cyrus Harding
disappeared to the moment when his companions set foot on the
ground. They had hopes therefore of arriving in time to save him.
"Let us look for him! let us look for him!" cried Neb.

"Yes, Neb," replied Gideon Spilett, "and we will find him
too!"

"Living, I trust!"

"Still living!"

"Can he swim?" asked Pencroft.
