<br/>"What's happening down there?" asked Pencroft, examining the<br/>surface of the lake.<br/><br/>"Top smells some amphibious creature," replied Herbert.<br/><br/>"An alligator, perhaps," said the reporter.<br/><br/>"I do not think so," replied Harding. "Alligators are only met<br/>with in regions less elevated in latitude."<br/><br/>Meanwhile Top had returned at his master's call, and had<br/>regained the shore: but he could not stay quiet; he plunged in<br/>among the tall grass, and guided by instinct, he appeared to follow<br/>some invisible being which was slipping along under the surface of<br/>the water. However the water was calm; not a ripple disturbed its<br/>surface. Several times the settlers stopped on the bank, and<br/>observed it attentively. Nothing appeared. There was some mystery<br/>there.<br/><br/>The engineer was puzzled.<br/><br/>"Let us pursue this exploration to the end," said he.<br/><br/>Half an hour after they had all arrived at the southeast angle<br/>of the lake, on Prospect Heights. At this point the examination of<br/>the banks of the lake was considered finished, and yet the engineer<br/>had not been able to discover how and where the waters were<br/>discharged. "There is no doubt this overflow exists," he repeated,<br/>and since it is not visible it must go through the granite cliff at<br/>the west!"<br/><br/>"But what importance do you attach to knowing that, my dear<br/>Cyrus?" asked Gideon Spilett.<br/><br/>"Considerable importance," replied the engineer; "for if it<br/>flows through the cliff there is probably some cavity, which it<br/>would be easy to render habitable after turning away the<br/>water."<br/><br/>
