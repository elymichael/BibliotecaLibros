<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>20<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>Things happened as Pencroft had predicted, he being seldom<br/>mistaken in his prognostications. The wind rose, and from a fresh<br/>breeze it soon increased to a regular gale; that is to say, it<br/>acquired a speed of from forty to forty-five miles an hour, before<br/>which a ship in the open sea would have run under close-reefed<br/>topsails. Now, as it was nearly six o'clock when the "Bonadventure"<br/>reached the gulf, and as at that moment the tide turned, it was<br/>impossible to enter. They were therefore compelled to stand off,<br/>for even if he had wished to do so, Pencroft could not have gained<br/>the mouth of the Mercy. Hoisting the jib to the mainmast by way of<br/>a storm-sail, he hove to, putting the head of the vessel towards<br/>the land.<br/><br/>Fortunately, although the wind was strong the sea, being<br/>sheltered by the land, did not run very high. They had then little<br/>to fear from the waves, which always endanger small craft. The<br/>"Bonadventure" would doubtlessly not have capsized, for she was<br/>well ballasted, but enormous masses of water falling on the deck<br/>might injure her if her timbers could not sustain them. Pencroft,<br/>as a good sailor, was prepared for anything. Certainly, he had<br/>great confidence in his vessel, but nevertheless he awaited the<br/>return of day with some anxiety.<br/><br/>During the night, Cyrus Harding and Gideon Spilett had no<br/>opportunity for talking together, and yet the words pronounced in<br/>the reporter's ear by the engineer were well worth being discussed,<br/>together with the mysterious influence which appeared to reign over<br/>Lincoln Island. Gideon Spilett did not cease from pondering over<br/>this new and inexplicable incident, the appearance of a fire on the<br/>coast of the island. The fire had actually been seen! His<br/>companions, Herbert and Pencroft, had seen it with him! The fire<br/>had served to signalize the position of the island during that dark<br/>night, and they had not doubted that it was lighted by the<br/>engineer's hand; and here was Cyrus Harding expressly declaring<br/>that he had never done anything of the sort! Spilett resolved to<br/>recur to this incident as soon as the "Bonadventure" returned, and<br/>to urge Cyrus Harding to acquaint their companions with these<br/>strange facts. Perhaps it would be decided to make in common a<br/>complete investigation of every part of Lincoln Island.<br/><br/>However that might be, on this evening no fire was lighted on<br/>these yet unknown shores, which formed the entrance to the gulf,<br/>and the little vessel stood off during the night.<br/><br/>When the first streaks of dawn appeared in the western horizon,<br/>the wind, which had slightly fallen, shifted two points, and<br/>enabled Pencroft to enter the narrow gulf with greater ease.<br/>Towards seven o'clock in the morning, the "Bonadventure,"<br/>weathering the North Mandible Cape, entered the strait and glided<br/>on to the waters, so strangely enclosed in the frame of lava.<br/><br/>"Well," said Pencroft, "this bay would make admirable roads, in<br/>which a whole fleet could lie at their ease!"<br/><br/>
