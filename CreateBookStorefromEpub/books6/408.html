"That's settled. Let us be off," said the reporter.<br/><br/>Pencroft, Herbert, and Gideon Spilett, on their return to<br/>Granite House, told the engineer all that had passed, and the<br/>latter approved of their arrangements both for the present and the<br/>future. He also promised the sailor that he would study that part<br/>of the channel situated between the islet and the coast, so as to<br/>ascertain if it would not be possible to make an artificial harbor<br/>there by means of dams. In this way, the "Bonadventure" would be<br/>always within reach, under the eyes of the colonists, and if<br/>necessary, under lock and key.<br/><br/>That evening a telegram was sent to Ayrton, requesting him to<br/>bring from the corral a couple of goats, which Neb wished to<br/>acclimatize to the plateau. Singularly enough, Ayrton did not<br/>acknowledge the receipt of the despatch, as he was accustomed to<br/>do. This could not but astonish the engineer. But it might be that<br/>Ayrton was not at that moment in the corral, or even that he was on<br/>his way back to Granite House. In fact, two days had already passed<br/>since his departure, and it had been decided that on the evening of<br/>the 10th or at the latest the morning of the 11th, he should<br/>return. The colonists waited, therefore, for Ayrton to appear on<br/>Prospect Heights. Neb and Herbert even watched at the bridge so as<br/>to be ready to lower it the moment their companion presented<br/>himself.<br/><br/>But up to ten in the evening, there were no signs of Ayrton. It<br/>was, therefore, judged best to send a fresh despatch, requiring an<br/>immediate reply.<br/><br/>The bell of the telegraph at Granite House remained mute.<br/><br/>The colonists' uneasiness was great. What had happened? Was<br/>Ayrton no longer at the corral, or if he was still there, had he no<br/>longer control over his movements? Could they go to the corral in<br/>this dark night?<br/><br/>They consulted. Some wished to go, the others to remain.<br/><br/>"But," said Herbert, "perhaps some accident has happened to the<br/>telegraphic apparatus, so that it works no longer?"<br/><br/>"That may be," said the reporter.<br/><br/>"Wait till to-morrow," replied Cyrus Harding. "It is possible,<br/>indeed, that Ayrton has not received our despatch, or even that we<br/>have not received his."<br/><br/>They waited, of course not without some anxiety.<br/>
