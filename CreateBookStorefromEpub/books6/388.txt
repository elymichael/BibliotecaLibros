"And can you guess, Pencroft," asked the reporter, "how it
happened, or what can have occasioned the explosion?"

"Oh! Mr. Spilett, nothing is more simple," answered Pencroft. "A
convict vessel is not disciplined like a man-of-war! Convicts are
not sailors. Of course the powder-magazine was open, and as they
were firing incessantly, some careless or clumsy fellow just blew
up the vessel!"

"Captain Harding," said Herbert, "what astonishes me is that the
explosion has not produced more effect. The report was not loud,
and besides there are so few planks and timbers torn out. It seems
as if the ship had rather foundered than blown up."

"Does that astonish you, my boy?" asked the engineer.

"Yes, captain."

"And it astonishes me also, Herbert," replied he, "but when we
visit the hull of the brig, we shall no doubt find the explanation
of the matter."

"Why, captain," said Pencroft, "you don't suppose that the
'Speedy' simply foundered like a ship which has struck on a
rock?"

"Why not," observed Neb, "if there are rocks in the
channel?"

"Nonsense, Neb," answered Pencroft, "you did not look at the
right moment. An instant before she sank, the brig, as I saw
perfectly well, rose on an enormous wave, and fell back on her
larboard side. Now, if she had only struck, she would have sunk
quietly and gone to the bottom like an honest vessel."

"It was just because she was not an honest vessel!" returned
Neb.

"Well, we shall soon see, Pencroft," said the engineer.
