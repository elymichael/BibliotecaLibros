"Yes."<br/><br/>"But you don't believe that he will make fire?"<br/><br/>"I shall believe it when the wood is blazing in the<br/>fireplace."<br/><br/>"It will blaze, since my master has said so."<br/><br/>"We shall see!"<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the sun had not reached the highest point in its<br/>course above the horizon. The exploration, therefore, continued,<br/>and was usefully marked by a discovery which Herbert made of a tree<br/>whose fruit was edible. This was the stone-pine, which produces an<br/>excellent almond, very much esteemed in the temperate regions of<br/>America and Europe. These almonds were in a perfect state of<br/>maturity, and Herbert described them to his companions, who feasted<br/>on them.<br/><br/>"Come," said Pencroft, "sea-weed by way of bread, raw mussels<br/>for meat, and almonds for dessert, that's certainly a good dinner<br/>for those who have not a single match in their pocket!"<br/><br/>We mustn't complain," said Herbert.<br/><br/>"I am not complaining, my boy," replied Pencroft, "only I<br/>repeat, that meat is a little too much economized in this sort of<br/>meal."<br/><br/>"Top has found something!" cried Neb, who ran towards a thicket,<br/>in the midst of which the dog had disappeared, barking. With Top's<br/>barking were mingled curious gruntings.<br/><br/>The sailor and Herbert had followed Neb. If there was game there<br/>this was not the time to discuss how it was to be cooked, but<br/>rather, how they were to get hold of it.<br/>
