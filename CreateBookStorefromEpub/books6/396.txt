"My opinion," said Pencroft, "is that, whoever he may be, he is
a brave man, and he has my esteem!"

"Be it so," answered Harding, "but that is not an answer,
Pencroft."

"Master," then said Neb, "my idea is, that we may search as long
as we like for this gentleman whom you are talking about, but that
we shall not discover him till he pleases."

"That's not bad, what you say, Neb," observed Pencroft.

"I am of Neb's opinion," said Gideon Spilett, "but that is no
reason for not attempting the adventure. Whether we find this
mysterious being or not, we shall at least have fulfilled our duty
towards him."

"And you, my boy, give us your opinion," said the engineer,
turning to Herbert.

"Oh," cried Herbert, his countenance full of animation, "how I
should like to thank him, he who saved you first, and who has now
saved us!"

"Of course, my boy," replied Pencroft, "so would I and all of
us. I am not inquisitive, but I would give one of my eyes to see
this individual face to face! It seems to me that he must be
handsome, tall, strong, with a splendid beard, radiant hair, and
that he must be seated on clouds, a great ball in his hands!"

"But, Pencroft," answered Spilett, "you are describing a picture
of the Creator."

"Possibly, Mr. Spilett," replied the sailor, "but that is how I
imagine him!"

"And you, Ayrton?" asked the engineer.
