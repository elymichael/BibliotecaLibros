This day, the 18th of March, there remained only provisions for<br/>two days, although they limited their consumption to the bare<br/>necessaries of life. All their science and intelligence could avail<br/>them nothing in their present position. They were in the hand of<br/>God.<br/><br/>Cyrus Harding was calm, Gideon Spilett more nervous, and<br/>Pencroft, a prey to sullen anger, walked to and fro on the rock.<br/>Herbert did not for a moment quit the engineer's side, as if<br/>demanding from him that assistance he had no power to give. Neb and<br/>Ayrton were resigned to their fate.<br/><br/>"Ah, what a misfortune! what a misfortune!" often repeated<br/>Pencroft. "If we had but a walnut-shell to take us to Tabor Island!<br/>But we have nothing, nothing!"<br/><br/>"Captain Nemo did right to die," said Neb.<br/><br/>During the five ensuing days Cyrus Harding and his unfortunate<br/>companions husbanded their provisions with the most extreme care,<br/>eating only what would prevent them from dying of starvation. Their<br/>weakness was extreme. Herbert and Neb began to show symptoms of<br/>delirium.<br/><br/>Under these circumstances was it possible for them to retain<br/>even the shadow of a hope? No! What was their sole remaining<br/>chance? That a vessel should appear in sight of the rock? But they<br/>knew only too well from experience that no ships ever visited this<br/>part of the Pacific. Could they calculate that, by a truly<br/>providential coincidence, the Scotch yacht would arrive precisely<br/>at this time in search of Ayrton at Tabor Island? It was scarcely<br/>probable; and, besides, supposing she should come there, as the<br/>colonists had not been able to deposit a notice pointing out<br/>Ayrton's change of abode, the commander of the yacht, after having<br/>explored Tabor Island without results, would again set sail and<br/>return to lower latitudes.<br/><br/>No! no hope of being saved could be retained, and a horrible<br/>death, death from hunger and thirst, awaited them upon this<br/>rock.<br/><br/>Already they were stretched on the rock, inanimate, and no<br/>longer conscious of what passed around them. Ayrton alone, by a<br/>supreme effort, from time to time raised his head, and cast a<br/>despairing glance over the desert ocean.<br/><br/>But on the morning of the 24th of March Ayrton's arms were<br/>extended toward a point in the horizon; he raised himself, at first<br/>on his knees, then upright, and his hand seemed to make a<br/>signal.<br/><br/>A sail was in sight off the rock. She was evidently not without<br/>an object. The reef was the mark for which she was making in a<br/>direct line, under all steam, and the unfortunate colonists might<br/>have made her out some hours before if they had had the strength to<br/>watch the horizon.<br/><br/>"The 'Duncan'!" murmured Ayrtonâ€”and fell back without sign of<br/>life.<br/>
