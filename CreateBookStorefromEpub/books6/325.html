<br/>"Ayrton was alone, but he had no want of either ammunition,<br/>weapons, tools, or seeds.<br/><br/>"At his, the convict's disposal, was the house built by honest<br/>Captain Grant. He had only to live and expiate in solitude the<br/>crimes which he had committed.<br/><br/>"Gentlemen, he repented, he was ashamed of his crimes and was<br/>very miserable! He said to himself, that if men came some day to<br/>take him from that islet, he must be worthy to return among them!<br/>How he suffered, that wretched man! How he labored to recover<br/>himself by work! How he prayed to be reformed by prayer! For two<br/>years, three years, this went on, but Ayrton, humbled by solitude,<br/>always looking for some ship to appear on the horizon, asking<br/>himself if the time of expiation would soon be complete, suffered<br/>as none other suffered!

Ayrton, you are forgiven! And now you will be our<br/>companion?"<br/><br/>Ayrton drew back.<br/><br/>"Here is my hand!" said the engineer.<br/><br/>
