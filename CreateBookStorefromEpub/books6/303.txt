"Yes," replied Harding, "we must take him to the plateau, on the
border of the forest. There the experiment will be more
conclusive."

"Besides, he could not run away," said Neb, "since the bridge is
raised."

"Oh!" said Pencroft, "that isn't a man to be troubled by a
stream like Creek Glycerine! He could cross it directly, at a
single bound!"

"We shall soon see," Harding contented himself with replying,
his eyes not quitting those of his patient.

The latter was then led towards the mouth of the Mercy, and all
climbing the left bank of the river, reached Prospect Heights.

Arrived at the spot on which grew the first beautiful trees of
the forest, their foliage slightly agitated by the breeze, the
stranger appeared greedily to drink in the penetrating odor which
filled the atmosphere, and a long sigh escaped from his chest.

The settlers kept behind him, ready to seize him if he made any
movement to escape!

And, indeed, the poor creature was on the point of springing
into the creek which separated him from the forest, and his legs
were bent for an instant as if for a spring, but almost immediately
he stepped back, half sank down, and a large tear fell from his
eyes.

"Ah!" exclaimed Cyrus Harding, "you have become a man again, for
you can weep!"
