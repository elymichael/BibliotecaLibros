"Will you let me try?" said the boy, and very cleverly, without<br/>breaking it, he managed to draw out the wretched yet precious<br/>little bit of wood which was of such great importance to these poor<br/>men. It was unused.<br/><br/>"Hurrah!" cried Pencroft; "it is as good as having a whole<br/>cargo!" He took the match, and, followed by his companions, entered<br/>the cave.<br/><br/>This small piece of wood, of which so many in an inhabited<br/>country are wasted with indifference and are of no value, must here<br/>be used with the greatest caution.<br/><br/>The sailor first made sure that it was quite dry; that done, "We<br/>must have some paper," said he.<br/><br/>"Here," replied Spilett, after some hesitation tearing a leaf<br/>out of his note-book.<br/><br/>Pencroft took the piece of paper which the reporter held out to<br/>him, and knelt down before the fireplace. Some handfuls of grass,<br/>leaves, and dry moss were placed under the fagots and disposed in<br/>such a way that the air could easily circulate, and the dry wood<br/>would rapidly catch fire.<br/><br/>Pencroft then twisted the piece of paper into the shape of a<br/>cone, as smokers do in a high wind, and poked it in among the moss.<br/>Taking a small, rough stone, he wiped it carefully, and with a<br/>beating heart, holding his breath, he gently rubbed the match. The<br/>first attempt did not produce any effect. Pencroft had not struck<br/>hard enough, fearing to rub off the phosphorus.<br/><br/>"No, I can't do it," said he, "my hand trembles, the match has<br/>missed fire; I cannot, I will not!" and rising, he told Herbert to<br/>take his place.<br/><br/>Certainly the boy had never in all his life been so nervous.<br/>Prometheus going to steal the fire from heaven could not have been<br/>more anxious. He did not hesitate, however, but struck the match<br/>directly.<br/><br/>A little spluttering was heard and a tiny blue flame sprang up,<br/>making a choking smoke. Herbert quickly turned the match so as to<br/>augment the flame, and then slipped it into the paper cone, which<br/>in a few seconds too caught fire, and then the moss.<br/><br/>A minute later the dry wood crackled and a cheerful flame,<br/>assisted by the vigorous blowing of the sailor, sprang up in the<br/>midst of the darkness.<br/>
