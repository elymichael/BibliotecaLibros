"But is it not possible, captain, that the water flows away at<br/>the bottom of the lake," said Herbert, "and that it reaches the sea<br/>by some subterranean passage?"<br/><br/>"That might be," replied the engineer, "and should it be so we<br/>shall be obliged to build our house ourselves, since nature has not<br/>done it for us."<br/><br/>The colonists were about to begin to traverse the plateau to<br/>return to the Chimneys, when Top gave new signs of agitation. He<br/>barked with fury, and before his master could restrain him, he had<br/>plunged a second time into the lake.<br/><br/>All ran towards the bank. The dog was already more than twenty<br/>feet off, and Cyrus was calling him back, when an enormous head<br/>emerged from the water, which did not appear to be deep in that<br/>place.<br/><br/>Herbert recognized directly the species of amphibian to which<br/>the tapering head, with large eyes, and adorned with long silky<br/>mustaches, belonged.<br/><br/>"A lamantin!" he cried.<br/><br/>It was not a lamantin, but one of that species of the order of<br/>cetaceans, which bear the name of the "dugong," for its nostrils<br/>were open at the upper part of its snout. The enormous animal<br/>rushed on the dog, who tried to escape by returning towards the<br/>shore. His master could do nothing to save him, and before Gideon<br/>Spilett or Herbert thought of bending their bows, Top, seized by<br/>the dugong, had disappeared beneath the water.<br/><br/>Neb, his iron-tipped spear in his hand, wished to go to Top's<br/>help, and attack the dangerous animal in its own element.<br/><br/>"No, Neb," said the engineer, restraining his courageous<br/>servant.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, a struggle was going on beneath the water, an<br/>inexplicable struggle, for in his situation Top could not possibly<br/>resist; and judging by the bubbling of the surface it must be also<br/>a terrible struggle, and could not but terminate in the death of<br/>the dog! But suddenly, in the middle of a foaming circle, Top<br/>reappeared. Thrown in the air by some unknown power, he rose ten<br/>feet above the surface of the lake, fell again into the midst of<br/>the agitated waters, and then soon gained the shore, without any<br/>severe wounds, miraculously saved.<br/><br/>Cyrus Harding and his companions could not understand it. What<br/>was not less inexplicable was that the struggle still appeared to<br/>be going on. Doubtless, the dugong, attacked by some powerful<br/>animal, after having released the dog, was fighting on its own<br/>account. But it did not last long. The water became red with blood,<br/>and the body of the dugong, emerging from the sheet of scarlet<br/>which spread around, soon stranded on a little beach at the south<br/>angle of the lake. The colonists ran towards it. The dugong was<br/>dead. It was an enormous animal, fifteen or sixteen feet long, and<br/>must have weighed from three to four thousand pounds. At its neck<br/>was a wound, which appeared to have been produced by a sharp<br/>blade.<br/>
