"This unfortunate man," observed Gideon Spilett, "was no longer
acquainted with either months or years!"

"Yes!" added Herbert, "and he had been twelve years already on
the islet when we found him there!"

"Twelve years!" rejoined Harding. "Ah! twelve years of solitude,
after a wicked life, perhaps, may well impair a man's reason!"

"I am induced to think," said Pencroft, "that this man was not
wrecked on Tabor Island, but that in consequence of some crime he
was left there."

"You must be right, Pencroft," replied the reporter, "and if it
is so it is not impossible that those who left him on the island
may return to fetch him some day!"

"And they will no longer find him," said Herbert.

"But then," added Pencroft, "they must return, andâ€”"

"My friends," said Cyrus Harding, "do not let us discuss this
question until we know more about it. I believe that the unhappy
man has suffered, that he has severely expiated his faults,
whatever they may have been, and that the wish to unburden himself
stifles him. Do not let us press him to tell us his history! He
will tell it to us doubtless, and when we know it, we shall see
what course it will be best to follow. He alone besides can tell
us, if he has more than a hope, a certainty, of returning some day
to his country, but I doubt it!"

"And why?" asked the reporter.

"Because that, in the event of his being sure of being delivered
at a certain time, he would have waited the hour of his deliverance
and would not have thrown this document into the sea. No, it is
more probable that he was condemned to die on that islet, and that
he never expected to see his fellow-creatures again!"
