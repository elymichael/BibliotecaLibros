<br/>The lad felt at this moment highly interested. He held his<br/>breath, and Pencroft, his eyes staring, his mouth open, his lips<br/>advanced, as if about to taste a piece of grouse, scarcely<br/>breathed.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the birds walked about the hooks, without taking any<br/>notice of them. Pencroft then gave little tugs which moved the bait<br/>as if the worms had been still alive.<br/><br/>The sailor undoubtedly felt much greater anxiety than does the<br/>fisherman, for he does not see his prey coming through the water.<br/>The jerks attracted the attention of the gallinaceae, and they<br/>attacked the hooks with their beaks. Three voracious grouse<br/>swallowed at the same moment bait and hook. Suddenly with a smart<br/>jerk, Pencroft "struck" his line, and a flapping of wings showed<br/>that the birds were taken.<br/><br/>"Hurrah!" he cried, rushing towards the game, of which he made<br/>himself master in an instant.<br/><br/>Herbert clapped his hands. It was the first time that he had<br/>ever seen birds taken with a line, but the sailor modestly<br/>confessed that it was not his first attempt, and that besides he<br/>could not claim the merit of invention.<br/><br/>"And at any rate," added he, "situated as we are, we must hope<br/>to hit upon many other contrivances."<br/><br/>The grouse were fastened by their claws, and Pencroft, delighted<br/>at not having to appear before their companions with empty hands,<br/>and observing that the day had begun to decline, judged it best to<br/>return to their dwelling.<br/><br/>The direction was indicated by the river, whose course they had<br/>only to follow, and, towards six o'clock, tired enough with their<br/>excursion, Herbert and Pencroft arrived at the Chimneys.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
