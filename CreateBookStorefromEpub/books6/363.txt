"And our vessel?" said Herbert.

"Oh," answered Pencroft, "she is sheltered in Port Balloon, and
I defy any of those rascals there to find her!"

The engineer's orders were immediately executed. Neb and Ayrton
ascended the plateau, and took the necessary precautions to conceal
any indication of a settlement. While they were thus occupied,
their companions went to the border of Jacamar Wood, and brought
back a large quantity of branches and creepers, which would at some
distance appear as natural foliage, and thus disguise the windows
in the granite cliff. At the same time, the ammunition and guns
were placed ready so as to be at hand in case of an unexpected
attack.

When all these precautions had been taken,—

"My friends," said Harding, and his voice betrayed some emotion,
"if the wretches endeavor to seize Lincoln Island, we shall defend
it—shall we not?"

"Yes, Cyrus," replied the reporter, "and if necessary we will
die to defend it!"

The engineer extended his hand to his companions, who pressed it
warmly. Ayrton remained in his corner, not joining the colonists.
Perhaps he, the former convict, still felt himself unworthy to do
so!

Cyrus Harding understood what was passing in Ayrton's mind, and
going to him—

"And you, Ayrton," he asked, "what will you do?"

"My duty," answered Ayrton.

He then took up his station near the window and gazed through
the foliage.
