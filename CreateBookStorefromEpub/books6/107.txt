"I would rather be here than in the hands of the Southerners,"
cried the sailor, "especially since the captain has been kind
enough to come and join us again."

"So would I, truly!" replied the reporter. "Besides, what do we
want? Nothing."

"If that is not—everything!" replied Pencroft, laughing and
shrugging his shoulders. "But, some day or other, we shall find
means of going away!"

"Sooner, perhaps, than you imagine, my friends," remarked the
engineer, "if Lincoln Island is but a medium distance from an
inhabited island, or from a continent. We shall know in an hour. I
have not a map of the Pacific, but my memory has preserved a very
clear recollection of its southern part. The latitude which I
obtained yesterday placed New Zealand to the west of Lincoln
Island, and the coast of Chile to the east. But between these two
countries, there is a distance of at least six thousand miles. It
has, therefore, to be determined what point in this great space the
island occupies, and this the longitude will give us presently,
with a sufficient approximation, I hope."

"Is not the archipelago of the Pomoutous the nearest point to us
in latitude?" asked Herbert.

"Yes," replied the engineer, "but the distance which separates
us from it is more than twelve hundred miles."

"And that way?" asked Neb, who followed the conversation with
extreme interest, pointing to the south.

"That way, nothing," replied Pencroft.

"Nothing, indeed," added the engineer.

"Well, Cyrus," asked the reporter, "if Lincoln Island is not
more than two or three thousand miles from New Zealand or
Chile?"

"Well," replied the engineer, "instead of building a house we
will build a boat, and Master Pencroft shall be put in
command—"
