<br/>"There," exclaimed Pencroft, "our iron-clads can come here after<br/>all! They would not run aground!"<br/><br/>"Indeed," said Gideon Spilett, "this gulf is a regular abyss,<br/>but, taking into consideration the volcanic origin of the island,<br/>it is not astonishing that the sea should offer similar<br/>depressions."<br/><br/>"One would say too," observed Herbert, "that these cliffs were<br/>perfectly perpendicular; and I believe that at their foot, even<br/>with a line five or six times longer, Pencroft would not find<br/>bottom."<br/><br/>"That is all very well," then said the reporter, "but I must<br/>point out to Pencroft that his harbor is wanting in one very<br/>important respect!"<br/><br/>"And what is that, Mr. Spilett?"<br/><br/>"An opening, a cutting of some sort, to give access to the<br/>interior of the island. I do not see a spot on which we could<br/>land." And, in fact, the steep lava cliffs did not afford a single<br/>place suitable for landing. They formed an insuperable barrier,<br/>recalling, but with more wildness, the fiords of Norway. The<br/>"Bonadventure," coasting as close as possible along the cliffs, did<br/>not discover even a projection which would allow the passengers to<br/>leave the deck.<br/><br/>Pencroft consoled himself by saying that with the help of a mine<br/>they could soon open out the cliff when that was necessary, and<br/>then, as there was evidently nothing to be done in the gulf, he<br/>steered his vessel towards the strait and passed out at about two<br/>o'clock in the afternoon.<br/><br/>"Ah!" said Nab, uttering a sigh of satisfaction.<br/><br/>One might really say that the honest Negro did not feel at his<br/>ease in those enormous jaws.<br/><br/>The distance from Mandible Cape to the mouth of the Mercy was<br/>not more than eight miles. The head of the "Bonadventure" was put<br/>towards Granite House, and a fair wind filling her sails, she ran<br/>rapidly along the coast.<br/><br/>
