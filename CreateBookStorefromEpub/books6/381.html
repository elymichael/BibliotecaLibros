<br/>Then there was a general helter-skelter. The ten others, not<br/>even stopping to pick up their dead or wounded companions, fled to<br/>the other side of the islet, tumbled into the boat which had<br/>brought them, and pulled away with all their strength.<br/><br/>"Eight less!" exclaimed Pencroft. "Really, one would have<br/>thought that Mr. Spilett and Ayrton had given the word to fire<br/>together!"<br/><br/>"Gentlemen," said Ayrton, as he reloaded his gun, "this is<br/>becoming more serious. The brig is making sail!"<br/><br/>"The anchor is weighed!" exclaimed Pencroft.<br/><br/>"Yes, and she is already moving."<br/><br/>In fact, they could distinctly hear the creaking of the<br/>windlass. The "Speedy" was at first held by her anchor; then, when<br/>that had been raised, she began to drift towards the shore. The<br/>wind was blowing from the sea; the jib and the foretopsail were<br/>hoisted, and the vessel gradually approached the island.<br/><br/>From the two posts of the Mercy and the Chimneys they watched<br/>her without giving a sign of life, but not without some emotion.<br/>What could be more terrible for the colonists than to be exposed,<br/>at a short distance, to the brig's guns, without being able to<br/>reply with any effect? How could they then prevent the pirates from<br/>landing?<br/><br/>Cyrus Harding felt this strongly, and he asked himself what it<br/>would be possible to do. Before long, he would be called upon for<br/>his determination. But what was it to be? To shut themselves up in<br/>Granite House, to be besieged there, to remain there for weeks, for<br/>months even, since they had an abundance of provisions? So far<br/>good! But after that? The pirates would not the less be masters of<br/>the island, which they would ravage at their pleasure, and in time,<br/>they would end by having their revenge on the prisoners in Granite<br/>House.<br/><br/>However, one chance yet remained; it was that Bob Harvey, after<br/>all, would not venture his ship into the channel, and that he would<br/>keep outside the islet. He would be still separated from the coast<br/>by half a mile, and at that distance his shot could not be very<br/>destructive.<br/><br/>"Never!" repeated Pencroft, "Bob Harvey will never, if he is a<br/>good seaman, enter that channel! He knows well that it would risk<br/>the brig, if the sea got up ever so little! And what would become<br/>of him without his vessel?"<br/><br/>
