"Yes," said the engineer, "we will do all that it is humanly
possible to do, but I repeat we shall not find him until he himself
permits us."

"Shall we stay at the corral?" asked Pencroft.

"We shall stay here," answered Harding. "Provisions are
abundant, and we are here in the very center of the circle we have
to explore. Besides, if necessary, the cart will take us rapidly to
Granite House."

"Good!" answered the sailor. "Only I have a remark to make."

"What is it?"

"Here is the fine season getting on, and we must not forget that
we have a voyage to make."

"A voyage?" said Gideon Spilett.

"Yes, to Tabor Island," answered Pencroft. "It is necessary to
carry a notice there to point out the position of our island and
say that Ayrton is here in case the Scotch yacht should come to
take him off. Who knows if it is not already too late?"

"But, Pencroft," asked Ayrton, "how do you intend to make this
voyage?"

"In the 'Bonadventure.'"
