Neb's companions had watched his daring attempt with painful<br/>anxiety, and when he was out of sight, they fixed their attention<br/>on the land where their hope of safety lay, while eating some<br/>shell-fish with which the sand was strewn. It was a wretched<br/>repast, but still it was better than nothing. The opposite coast<br/>formed one vast bay, terminating on the south by a very sharp<br/>point, which was destitute of all vegetation, and was of a very<br/>wild aspect. This point abutted on the shore in a grotesque outline<br/>of high granite rocks. Towards the north, on the contrary, the bay<br/>widened, and a more rounded coast appeared, trending from the<br/>southwest to the northeast, and terminating in a slender cape. The<br/>distance between these two extremities, which made the bow of the<br/>bay, was about eight miles. Half a mile from the shore rose the<br/>islet, which somewhat resembled the carcass of a gigantic whale.<br/>Its extreme breadth was not more than a quarter of a mile.<br/><br/>Opposite the islet, the beach consisted first of sand, covered<br/>with black stones, which were now appearing little by little above<br/>the retreating tide. The second level was separated by a<br/>perpendicular granite cliff, terminated at the top by an unequal<br/>edge at a height of at least 300 feet. It continued thus for a<br/>length of three miles, ending suddenly on the right with a<br/>precipice which looked as if cut by the hand of man. On the left,<br/>above the promontory, this irregular and jagged cliff descended by<br/>a long slope of conglomerated rocks till it mingled with the ground<br/>of the southern point. On the upper plateau of the coast not a tree<br/>appeared. It was a flat tableland like that above Cape Town at the<br/>Cape of Good Hope, but of reduced proportions; at least so it<br/>appeared seen from the islet. However, verdure was not wanting to<br/>the right beyond the precipice. They could easily distinguish a<br/>confused mass of great trees, which extended beyond the limits of<br/>their view. This verdure relieved the eye, so long wearied by the<br/>continued ranges of granite. Lastly, beyond and above the plateau,<br/>in a northwesterly direction and at a distance of at least seven<br/>miles, glittered a white summit which reflected the sun's rays. It<br/>was that of a lofty mountain, capped with snow.<br/><br/>The question could not at present be decided whether this land<br/>formed an island, or whether it belonged to a continent. But on<br/>beholding the convulsed masses heaped up on the left, no geologist<br/>would have hesitated to give them a volcanic origin, for they were<br/>unquestionably the work of subterranean convulsions.<br/><br/>Gideon Spilett, Pencroft, and Herbert attentively examined this<br/>land, on which they might perhaps have to live many long years; on<br/>which indeed they might even die, should it be out of the usual<br/>track of vessels, as was likely to be the case.<br/><br/>"Well," asked Herbert, "what do you say, Pencroft?"<br/><br/>"There is some good and some bad, as in everything," replied the<br/>sailor. "We shall see. But now the ebb is evidently making. In<br/>three hours we will attempt the passage, and once on the other<br/>side, we will try to get out of this scrape, and I hope may find<br/>the captain." Pencroft was not wrong in his anticipations. Three<br/>hours later at low tide, the greater part of the sand forming the<br/>bed of the channel was uncovered. Between the islet and the coast<br/>there only remained a narrow channel which would no doubt be easy<br/>to cross.<br/><br/>About ten o'clock, Gideon Spilett and his companions stripped<br/>themselves of their clothes, which they placed in bundles on their<br/>heads, and then ventured into the water, which was not more than<br/>five feet deep. Herbert, for whom it was too deep, swam like a<br/>fish, and got through capitally. All three arrived without<br/>difficulty on the opposite shore. Quickly drying themselves in the<br/>sun, they put on their clothes, which they had preserved from<br/>contact with the water, and sat down to take counsel together what<br/>to do next.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
