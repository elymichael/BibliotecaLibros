two, and then we will set out. And now speak, Spilett."

The reporter then told him all that had occurred. He recounted
all the events with which Cyrus was unacquainted, the last fall of
the balloon, the landing on this unknown land, which appeared a
desert (whatever it was, whether island or continent), the
discovery of the Chimneys, the search for him, not forgetting of
course Neb's devotion, the intelligence exhibited by the faithful
Top, as well as many other matters.

"But," asked Harding, in a still feeble voice, "you did not,
then, pick me up on the beach?"

"No," replied the reporter.

"And did you not bring me to this cave?"

"No."

"At what distance is this cave from the sea?"

"About a mile," replied Pencroft; "and if you are astonished,
captain, we are not less surprised ourselves at seeing you in this
place!"

"Indeed," said the engineer, who was recovering gradually, and
who took great interest in these details, "indeed it is very
singular!"

"But," resumed the sailor, "can you tell us what happened after
you were carried off by the sea?"
