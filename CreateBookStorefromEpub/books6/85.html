<br/>"Why! our island! we have forgotten to christen it!"<br/><br/>Herbert was going to propose to give it the engineer's name and<br/>all his companions would have applauded him, when Cyrus Harding<br/>said simply,â€”<br/><br/>"Let us give it the name of a great citizen, my friend; of him<br/>who now struggles to defend the unity of the American Republic! Let<br/>us call it Lincoln Island!"<br/><br/>The engineer's proposal was replied to by three hurrahs.<br/><br/>And that evening, before sleeping, the new colonists talked of<br/>their absent country; they spoke of the terrible war which stained<br/>it with blood; they could not doubt that the South would soon be<br/>subdued, and that the cause of the North, the cause of justice,<br/>would triumph, thanks to Grant, thanks to Lincoln!<br/><br/>Now this happened the 30th of March, 1865. They little knew that<br/>sixteen days afterwards a frightful crime would be committed in<br/>Washington, and that on Good Friday Abraham Lincoln would fall by<br/>the hand of a fanatic.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
