<br/>The wind blowing out of Union Bay she ran before it, and thus<br/>showed her owners, much to their satisfaction, that she possessed a<br/>remarkably fast pair of heels, according to Pencroft's mode of<br/>speaking. After having doubled Flotsam Point and Claw Cape, the<br/>captain kept her close hauled, so as to sail along the southern<br/>coast of the island, when it was found she sailed admirably within<br/>five points of the wind. All hands were enchanted, they had a good<br/>vessel, which, in case of need, would be of great service to them,<br/>and with fine weather and a fresh breeze the voyage promised to be<br/>charming.<br/><br/>Pencroft now stood off the shore, three or four miles across<br/>from Port Balloon. The island then appeared in all its extent and<br/>under a new aspect, with the varied panorama of its shore from Claw<br/>Cape to Reptile End, the forests in which dark firs contrasted with<br/>the young foliage of other trees and overlooked the whole, and<br/>Mount Franklin whose lofty head was still whitened with snow.<br/><br/>"How beautiful it is!" cried Herbert.<br/><br/>"Yes, our island is beautiful and good," replied Pencroft. "I<br/>love it as I loved my poor mother. It received us poor and<br/>destitute, and now what is wanting to us five fellows who fell on<br/>it from the sky?"<br/><br/>"Nothing," replied Neb; "nothing, captain."<br/><br/>And the two brave men gave three tremendous cheers in honor of<br/>their island!<br/><br/>During all this time Gideon Spilett, leaning against the mast,<br/>sketched the panorama which was developed before his eyes.<br/><br/>Cyrus Harding gazed on it in silence.<br/><br/>"Well, Captain Harding," asked Pencroft, "what do you think of<br/>our vessel?"<br/><br/>"She appears to behave well," replied the engineer.<br/><br/>
