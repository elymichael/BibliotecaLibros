Herbert's chest was laid bare, and the blood having been
stanched with handkerchiefs, it was bathed with cold water.

The contusion, or rather the contused wound appeared,â€”an oval
below the chest between the third and fourth ribs. It was there
that Herbert had been hit by the bullet.

Cyrus Harding and Gideon Spilett then turned the poor boy over;
as they did so, he uttered a moan so feeble that they almost
thought it was his last sigh.

Herberts back was covered with blood from another contused
wound, by which the ball had immediately escaped.

"God be praised!" said the reporter, "the ball is not in the
body, and we shall not have to extract it."

"But the heart?" asked Harding.

"The heart has not been touched; if it had been, Herbert would
be dead!"

"Dead!" exclaimed Pencroft, with a groan.

The sailor had only heard the last words uttered by the
reporter.

"No, Pencroft," replied Cyrus Harding, "no! He is not dead. His
pulse still beats. He has even uttered a moan. But for your boy's
sake, calm yourself. We have need of all our self-possession."
