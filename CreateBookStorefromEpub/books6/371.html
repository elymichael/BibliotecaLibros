This Ayrton resolved to learn at any cost, and as an hour after<br/>his arrival the vociferations had begun to die away, and as a large<br/>number of the convicts were already buried in a drunken sleep,<br/>Ayrton did not hesitate to venture onto the "Speedy's" deck, which<br/>the extinguished lanterns now left in total darkness. He hoisted<br/>himself onto the cutwater, and by the bowsprit arrived at the<br/>forecastle. Then, gliding among the convicts stretched here and<br/>there, he made the round of the ship, and found that the "Speedy"<br/>carried four guns, which would throw shot of from eight to ten<br/>pounds in weight. He found also, on touching them that these guns<br/>were breech-loaders. They were therefore, of modern make, easily<br/>used, and of terrible effect.<br/><br/>As to the men lying on the deck, they were about ten in number,<br/>but it was to be supposed that more were sleeping down below.<br/>Besides, by listening to them, Ayrton had understood that there<br/>were fifty on board. That was a large number for the six settlers<br/>of Lincoln Island to contend with! But now, thanks to Ayrton's<br/>devotion, Cyrus Harding would not be surprised, he would know the<br/>strength of his adversaries, and would make his arrangements<br/>accordingly.<br/><br/>There was nothing more for Ayrton to do but to return, and<br/>render to his companions an account of the mission with which he<br/>had charged himself, and he prepared to regain the bows of the<br/>brig, so that he might let himself down into the water. But to this<br/>man, whose wish was, as he had said, to do more than his duty,<br/>there came an heroic thought. This was to sacrifice his own life,<br/>but save the island and the colonists. Cyrus Harding evidently<br/>could not resist fifty ruffians, all well armed, who, either by<br/>penetrating by main force into Granite House, or by starving out<br/>the besieged, could obtain from them what they wanted. And then he<br/>thought of his preservers—those who had made him again a man, and<br/>an honest mm, those to whom he owed all—murdered without pity,<br/>their works destroyed, their island turned into a pirates' den! He<br/>said to himself that he, Ayrton, was the principal cause of so many<br/>disasters, since his old companion, Bob Harvey, had but realized<br/>his own plans, and a feeling of horror took possession of him. Then<br/>he was seized with an irresistible desire to blow up the brig and<br/>with her, all whom she had on board. He would perish in the<br/>explosion, but he would have done his duty.<br/><br/>Ayrton did not hesitate. To reach the powder-room, which is<br/>always situated in the after-part of a vessel, was easy. There<br/>would be no want of powder in a vessel which followed such a trade,<br/>and a spark would be enough to destroy it in an instant.<br/><br/>Ayrton stole carefully along the between-decks, strewn with<br/>numerous sleepers, overcome more by drunkenness than sleep. A<br/>lantern was lighted at the foot of the mainmast, round which was<br/>hung a gun-rack, furnished with weapons of all sorts.<br/><br/>Ayrton took a revolver from the rack, and assured himself that<br/>it was loaded and primed. Nothing more was needed to accomplish the<br/>work of destruction. He then glided towards the stern, so as to<br/>arrive under the brig's poop at the powder-magazine.<br/><br/>It was difficult to proceed along the dimly lighted deck without<br/>stumbling over some half-sleeping convict, who retorted by oaths<br/>and kicks. Ayrton was, therefore, more than once obliged to halt.<br/>But at last he arrived at the partition dividing the aftercabin,<br/>and found the door opening into the magazine itself.<br/><br/>Ayrton, compelled to force it open, set to work. It was a<br/>difficult operation to perform without noise, for he had to break a<br/>padlock. But under his vigorous hand, the padlock broke, and the<br/>door was open.<br/><br/>At that moment a hand was laid on Ayrton's shoulder.<br/><br/>"What are you doing here?" asked a tail man, in a harsh voice,<br/>who, standing in the shadow, quickly threw the light of a lantern<br/>in Ayrton's face.<br/><br/>Ayrton drew beck. In the rapid flash of the lantern, he had<br/>recognized his former accomplice, Bob Harvey, who could not have<br/>known him, as he must have thought Ayrton long since dead.<br/>
