Herbert was not mistaken. In a few minutes the animal appeared
on the surface of the water. Top was upon it in a bound, and kept
it from plunging again. An instant later the capybara, dragged to
the bank, was killed by a blow from Neb's stick.

"Hurrah!" cried Pencroft, who was always ready with this cry of
triumph.

"Give me but a good fire, and this pig shall be gnawed to the
bones!"

Pencroft hoisted the capybara on his shoulders, and judging by
the height of the sun that it was about two o'clock, he gave the
signal to return.

Top's instinct was useful to the hunters, who, thanks to the
intelligent animal, were enabled to discover the road by which they
had come. Half an hour later they arrived at the river.

Pencroft soon made a raft of wood, as he had done before, though
if there was no fire it would be a useless task, and the raft
following the current, they returned towards the Chimneys.

But the sailor had not gone fifty paces when he stopped, and
again uttering a tremendous hurrah, pointed towards the angle of
the cliff,â€”

"Herbert! Neb! Look!" he shouted.

Smoke was escaping and curling up among the rocks.
