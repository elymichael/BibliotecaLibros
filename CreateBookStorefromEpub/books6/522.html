<br/>Towards seven in the morning the position was no longer tenable<br/>by the colonists, who accordingly took shelter in the borders of<br/>Jacamar Wood. Not only did the projectiles begin to rain around<br/>them, but the lava, overflowing the bed of Red Creek, threatened to<br/>cut off the road to the corral. The nearest rows of trees caught<br/>fire, and their sap, suddenly transformed into vapor, caused them<br/>to explode with loud reports, while others, less moist, remained<br/>unhurt in the midst of the inundation.<br/><br/>The colonists had again taken the road to the corral. They<br/>proceeded but slowly, frequently looking back; but, in consequence<br/>of the inclination of the soil, the lava gained rapidly in the<br/>east, and as its lower waves became solidified others, at boiling<br/>heat, covered them immediately.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the principal stream of Red Creek Valley became more<br/>and more menacing. All this portion of the forest was on fare, and<br/>enormous wreaths of smoke rolled over the trees, whore trunks were<br/>already consumed by the lava.<br/><br/>The colonists halted near the lake, about half a mile from the<br/>mouth of Red Creek. A question of life or death was now to be<br/>decided.<br/><br/>Cyrus Harding, accustomed to the consideration of important<br/>crises, and aware that he was addressing men capable of hearing the<br/>truth, whatever it might be, then said,—<br/><br/>"Either the lake will arrest the progress of the lava, and a<br/>part of the island will be preserved from utter destruction, or the<br/>stream will overrun the forests of the Far West, and not a tree or<br/>plant will remain on the surface of the soil. We shall have no<br/>prospect but that of starvation upon these barren rocks—a death<br/>which will probably be anticipated by the explosion of the<br/>island."<br/><br/>"In that case," replied Pencroft, folding his arms and stamping<br/>his foot, "what's the use of working any longer on the vessel?"<br/><br/>"Pencroft," answered Cyrus Harding, "we must do our duty to the<br/>last!"<br/><br/>At this instant the river of lava, after having broken a passage<br/>through the noble trees it devoured in its course, reached the<br/>borders of the lake. At this point there was an elevation of the<br/>soil which, had it been greater, might have sufficed to arrest the<br/>torrent.<br/><br/>"To work!" cried Cyrus Harding.<br/><br/>
