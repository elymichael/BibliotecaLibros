"It is here, Captain Harding," replied Ayrton, drawing towards<br/>him the fragile craft, which was protected by the arch of the<br/>vault.<br/><br/>"On board, Ayrton!"<br/><br/>The two colonists stepped into the boat. A slight undulation of<br/>the waves carried it farther under the low arch of the crypt, and<br/>there Ayrton, with the aid of flint and steel, lighted the lamp. He<br/>then took the oars, and the lamp having been placed in the bow of<br/>the boat, so that its rays fell before them, Cyrus Harding took the<br/>helm and steered through the shades of the grotto.<br/><br/>The "Nautilus" was there no longer to illuminate the cavern with<br/>its electric light. Possibly it might not yet be extinguished, but<br/>no ray escaped from the depths of the abyss in which reposed all<br/>that was mortal of Captain Nemo.<br/><br/>The light afforded by the lamp, although feeble, nevertheless<br/>enabled the engineer to advance slowly, following the wall of the<br/>cavern. A deathlike silence reigned under the vaulted roof, or at<br/>least in the anterior portion, for soon Cyrus Harding distinctly<br/>heard the rumbling which proceeded from the bowels of the<br/>mountain.<br/><br/>"That comes from the volcano," he said.<br/><br/>Besides these sounds, the presence of chemical combinations was<br/>soon betrayed by their powerful odor, and the engineer and his<br/>companion were almost suffocated by sulphurous vapors.<br/><br/>"This is what Captain Nemo feared," murmured Cyrus Harding,<br/>changing countenance. "We must go to the end, notwithstanding."<br/><br/>"Forward!" replied Ayrton, bending to his oars and directing the<br/>boat towards the head of the cavern.<br/><br/>Twenty-five minutes after entering the mouth of the grotto the<br/>boat reached the extreme end.<br/><br/>Cyrus Harding then, standing up, cast the light of the lamp upon<br/>the walls of the cavern which separated it from the central shaft<br/>of the volcano. What was the thickness of this wall? It might be<br/>ten feet or a hundred feetâ€”it was impossible to say. But the<br/>subterranean sounds were too perceptible to allow of the<br/>supposition that it was of any great thickness.<br/>
