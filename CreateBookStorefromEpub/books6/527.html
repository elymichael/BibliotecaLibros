<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>20<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>An isolated rock, thirty feet in length, twenty in breadth,<br/>scarcely ten from the water's edge, such was the only solid point<br/>which the waves of the Pacific had not engulfed.<br/><br/>It was all that remained of the structure of Granite House! The<br/>wall had fallen headlong and been then shattered to fragments, and<br/>a few of the rocks of the large room were piled one above another<br/>to form this point. All around had disappeared in the abyss; the<br/>inferior cone of Mount Franklin, rent asunder by the explosion; the<br/>lava jaws of Shark Gulf, the plateau of Prospect Heights, Safety<br/>Islet, the granite rocks of Port Balloon, the basalts of Dakkar<br/>Grotto, the long Serpentine Peninsula, so distant nevertheless from<br/>the center of the eruption. All that could now be seen of Lincoln<br/>Island was the narrow rock which now served as a refuge to the six<br/>colonists and their dog Top.<br/><br/>The animals had also perished in the catastrophe; the birds, as<br/>well as those representing the fauna of the islandâ€”all either<br/>crushed or drowned, and the unfortunate Jup himself had, alas!<br/>found his death in some crevice of the soil.<br/><br/>If Cyrus Harding, Gideon Spilett, Herbert, Pencroft, Neb, and<br/>Ayrton had survived, it was because, assembled under their tent,<br/>they had been hurled into the sea at the instant when the fragments<br/>of the island rained down on every side.<br/><br/>When they reached the surface they could only perceive, at half<br/>a cable's length, this mass of rocks, towards which they swam and<br/>on which they found footing.<br/><br/>On this barren rock they had now existed for nine days. A few<br/>provisions taken from the magazine of Granite House before the<br/>catastrophe, a little fresh water from the rain which had fallen in<br/>a hollow of the rock, was all that the unfortunate colonists<br/>possessed. Their last hope, the vessel, had been shattered to<br/>pieces. They had no means of quitting the reef; no fire, nor any<br/>means of obtaining it. It seemed that they must inevitably<br/>perish.<br/><br/>
