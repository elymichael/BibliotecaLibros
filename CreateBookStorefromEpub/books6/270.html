As there was no want of wood, Pencroft proposed to the engineer<br/>to give a double lining to the hull, to insure the strength of the<br/>vessel.<br/><br/>Harding, not knowing what the future might have in store for<br/>them, approved the sailor's idea of making the craft as strong as<br/>possible. The interior and deck of the vessel was entirely finished<br/>towards the 15th of September. For calking the seams they made<br/>oakum of dry seaweed, which was hammered in between the planks;<br/>then these seams were covered with boiling tar, which was obtained<br/>in great abundance from the pines in the forest.<br/><br/>The management of the vessel was very simple. She had from the<br/>first been ballasted with heavy blocks of granite walled up, in a<br/>bed of lime, twelve thousand pounds of which they stowed away.<br/><br/>A deck was placed over this ballast, and the interior was<br/>divided into two cabins; two benches extended along them and served<br/>also as lockers. The foot of the mast supported the partition which<br/>separated the two cabins, which were reached by two hatchways let<br/>into the deck.<br/><br/>Pencroft had no trouble in finding a tree suitable for the mast.<br/>He chose a straight young fir, with no knots, and which he had only<br/>to square at the step, and round off at the top. The ironwork of<br/>the mast, the rudder and the hull had been roughly but strongly<br/>forged at the Chimneys. Lastly, yards, masts, boom, spars, oars,<br/>etc., were all furnished by the first week in October, and it was<br/>agreed that a trial trip should be taken round the island, so as to<br/>ascertain how the vessel would behave at sea, and how far they<br/>might depend upon her.<br/><br/>During all this time the necessary works had not been neglected.<br/>The corral was enlarged, for the flock of musmons and goats had<br/>been increased by a number of young ones, who had to be housed and<br/>fed. The colonists had paid visits also to the oyster bed, the<br/>warren, the coal and iron mines, and to the till then unexplored<br/>districts of the Far West forest, which abounded in game. Certain<br/>indigenous plants were discovered, and those fit for immediate use<br/>contributed to vary the vegetable stores of Granite House.<br/><br/>They were a species of ficoide, some similar to those of the<br/>Cape, with eatable fleshy leaves, others bearing seeds containing a<br/>sort of flour.<br/><br/>On the 10th of October the vessel was launched. Pencroft was<br/>radiant with joy, the operation was perfectly successful; the boat<br/>completely rigged, having been pushed on rollers to the water's<br/>edge, was floated by the rising tide, amid the cheers of the<br/>colonists, particularly of Pencroft, who showed no modesty on this<br/>occasion. Besides his importance was to last beyond the finishing<br/>of the vessel, since, after having built her, he was to command<br/>her. The grade of captain was bestowed upon him with the<br/>approbation of all. To satisfy Captain Pencroft, it was now<br/>necessary to give a name to the vessel, and, after many<br/>propositions had been discussed, the votes were all in favor of the<br/>"Bonadventure." As soon as the "Bonadventure" had been lifted by<br/>the rising tide, it was seen that she lay evenly in the water, and<br/>would be easily navigated. However, the trial trip was to be made<br/>that very day, by an excursion off the coast. The weather was fine,<br/>the breeze fresh, and the sea smooth, especially towards the south<br/>coast, for the wind was blowing from the northwest.<br/><br/>"All hands on board," shouted Pencroft; but breakfast was first<br/>necessary, and it was thought best to take provisions on board, in<br/>the event of their excursion being prolonged until the evening.<br/><br/>Cyrus Harding was equally anxious to try the vessel, the model<br/>of which had originated with him, although on the sailor's advice<br/>he had altered some parts of it, but he did not share Pencroft's<br/>confidence in her, and as the latter had not again spoken of the<br/>voyage to Tabor Island, Harding hoped he had given it up. He would<br/>have indeed great reluctance in letting two or three of his<br/>companions venture so far in so small a boat, which was not of more<br/>than fifteen tons' burden.<br/><br/>At half-past ten everybody was on board, even Top and Jup, and<br/>Herbert weighed the anchor, which was fast in the sand near the<br/>mouth of the Mercy. The sail was hoisted, the Lincolnian flag<br/>floated from the masthead, and the "Bonadventure," steered by<br/>Pencroft, stood out to sea.<br/>
