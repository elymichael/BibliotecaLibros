They had no doubt about it themselves! Ayrton, surprised by the
pirates, had been murdered, and, perhaps, the wretches would profit
by the night to make a descent on the island!

Half an hour was passed in terrible anxiety. The firing had
ceased, and yet neither Ayrton nor Pencroft had reappeared. Was the
islet invaded? Ought they not to fly to the help of Ayrton and
Pencroft? But how? The tide being high at that time, rendered the
channel impassable. The boat was not there! We may imagine the
horrible anxiety which took possession of Harding and his
companions!

At last, towards half-past twelve, a boat, carrying two men,
touched the beach. It was Ayrton, slightly wounded in the shoulder,
and Pencroft, safe and sound, whom their friends received with open
arms.

All immediately took refuge in the Chimneys. There Ayrton
recounted all that had passed, even to his plan for blowing up the
brig, which he had attempted to put into execution.

All hands were extended to Ayrton, who did not conceal from them
that their situation was serious. The pirates had been alarmed.
They knew that Lincoln Island was inhabited. They would land upon
it in numbers and well armed. They would respect nothing. Should
the settlers fall into their hands, they must expect no mercy!

"Well, we shall know how to die!" said the reporter.

"Let us go in and watch," answered the engineer.

"Have we any chance of escape, captain?" asked the sailor.

"Yes, Pencroft."

"Hum! six against fifty!"

"Yes! six! without countingâ€”"
