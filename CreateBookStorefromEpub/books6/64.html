In the latter case,<br/>if the island is inhabited, we will try to get out of the scrape<br/>with the help of its inhabitants; if it is desert, we will try to<br/>get out of the scrape by ourselves."<br/><br/>"Certainly, nothing could be plainer," replied Pencroft.<br/><br/>"But, whether it is an island or a continent," asked Gideon<br/>Spilett, "whereabouts do you think, Cyrus, this storm has thrown<br/>us?"<br/><br/>
