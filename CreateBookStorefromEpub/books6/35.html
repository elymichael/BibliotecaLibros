This same morning, the 26th of March, at daybreak, Neb had set<br/>out on the shore in a northerly direction, and he had returned to<br/>the spot where the sea, no doubt, had closed over the unfortunate<br/>Harding.<br/><br/>That day's breakfast was composed solely of pigeon's eggs and<br/>lithodomes. Herbert had found some salt deposited by evaporation in<br/>the hollows of the rocks, and this mineral was very welcome.<br/><br/>The repast ended, Pencroft asked the reporter if he wished to<br/>accompany Herbert and himself to the forest, where they were going<br/>to try to hunt. But on consideration, it was thought necessary that<br/>someone should remain to keep in the fire, and to be at hand in the<br/>highly improbable event of Neb requiring aid. The reporter<br/>accordingly remained behind.<br/><br/>"To the chase, Herbert," said the sailor. "We shall find<br/>ammunition on our way, and cut our weapons in the forest." But at<br/>the moment of starting, Herbert observed, that since they had no<br/>tinder, it would perhaps be prudent to replace it by another<br/>substance.<br/><br/>"What?" asked Pencroft.<br/><br/>"Burnt linen," replied the boy. "That could in case of need<br/>serve for tinder."<br/><br/>The sailor thought it very sensible advice. Only it had the<br/>inconvenience of necessitating the sacrifice of a piece of<br/>handkerchief. Notwithstanding, the thing was well worth while<br/>trying, and a part of Pencroft's large checked handkerchief was<br/>soon reduced to the state of a half-burnt rag. This inflammable<br/>material was placed in the central chamber at the bottom of a<br/>little cavity in the rock, sheltered from all wind and damp.<br/><br/>It was nine o'clock in the morning. The weather was threatening<br/>and the breeze blew from the southeast. Herbert and Pencroft turned<br/>the angle of the Chimneys, not without having cast a look at the<br/>smoke which, just at that place, curled round a point of rock: they<br/>ascended the left bank of the river.<br/><br/>Arrived at the forest, Pencroft broke from the first tree two<br/>stout branches which he transformed into clubs, the ends of which<br/>Herbert rubbed smooth on a rock. Oh! what would they not have given<br/>for a knife!<br/><br/>The two hunters now advanced among the long grass, following the<br/>bank. From the turning which directed its course to the southwest,<br/>the river narrowed gradually and the channel lay between high<br/>banks, over which the trees formed a double arch. Pencroft, lest<br/>they should lose themselves, resolved to follow the course of the<br/>stream, which would always lead them back to the point from which<br/>they started. But the bank was not without some obstacles: here,<br/>the flexible branches of the trees bent level with the current;<br/>there, creepers and thorns which they had to break down with their<br/>sticks. Herbert often glided among the broken stumps with the<br/>agility of a young cat, and disappeared in the underwood. But<br/>Pencroft called him back directly, begging him not to wander away.<br/>Meanwhile, the sailor attentively observed the disposition and<br/>nature of the surrounding country. On the left bank, the ground,<br/>which was flat and marshy, rose imperceptibly towards the interior.<br/>It looked there like a network of liquid threads which doubtless<br/>reached the river by some underground drain. Sometimes a stream ran<br/>through the underwood, which they crossed without difficulty. The<br/>opposite shore appeared to be more uneven, and the valley of which<br/>the river occupied the bottom was more clearly visible. The hill,<br/>covered with trees disposed in terraces, intercepted the view. On<br/>the right bank walking would have been difficult, for the<br/>declivities fell suddenly, and the trees bending over the water<br/>were only sustained by the strength of their roots.<br/><br/>It is needless to add that this forest, as well as the coast<br/>already surveyed, was destitute of any sign of human life. Pencroft<br/>only saw traces of quadrupeds, fresh footprints of animals, of<br/>which he could not recognize the species. In all probability, and<br/>such was also Herbert's opinion, some had been left by formidable<br/>wild beasts which doubtless would give them some trouble; but<br/>nowhere did they observe the mark of an axe on the trees, nor the<br/>ashes of a fire, nor the impression of a human foot. On this they<br/>might probably congratulate themselves, for on any land in the<br/>middle of the Pacific the presence of man was perhaps more to be<br/>feared than desired. Herbert and Pencroft speaking little, for the<br/>difficulties of the way were great, advanced very slowly, and after<br/>walking for an hour they had scarcely gone more than a mile. As yet<br/>the hunt had not been successful. However, some birds sang and<br/>fluttered in the foliage, and appeared very timid, as if man had<br/>inspired them with an instinctive fear. Among others, Herbert<br/>described, in a marshy part of the forest, a bird with a long<br/>pointed beak, closely resembling the king-fisher, but its plumage<br/>was not fine, though of a metallic brilliancy.<br/>
