To replace lead, of which Harding had found no traces in the<br/>island, he employed granulated iron, which was easy to manufacture.<br/>These bullets, not having the weight of leaden bullets, were made<br/>larger, and each charge contained less, but the skill of the<br/>sportsmen made up this deficiency. As to powder, Cyrus Harding<br/>would have been able to make that also, for he had at his disposal<br/>saltpeter, sulphur, and coal; but this preparation requires extreme<br/>care, and without special tools it is difficult to produce it of a<br/>good quality. Harding preferred, therefore, to manufacture<br/>pyroxyle, that is to say gun-cotton, a substance in which cotton is<br/>not indispensable, as the elementary tissue of vegetables may be<br/>used, and this is found in an almost pure state, not only in<br/>cotton, but in the textile fiber of hemp and flax, in paper, the<br/>pith of the elder, etc. Now, the elder abounded in the island<br/>towards the mouth of Red Creek, and the colonists had already made<br/>coffee of the berries of these shrubs, which belong to the family<br/>of the caprifoliaceae.<br/><br/>The only thing to be collected, therefore, was elder-pith, for<br/>as to the other substance necessary for the manufacture of<br/>pyroxyle, it was only fuming azotic acid. Now, Harding having<br/>sulphuric acid at his disposal, had already been easily able to<br/>produce azotic acid by attacking the saltpeter with which nature<br/>supplied him. He accordingly resolved to manufacture and employ<br/>pyroxyle, although it has some inconveniences, that is to say, a<br/>great inequality of effect, an excessive inflammability, since it<br/>takes fire at one hundred and seventy degrees instead of two<br/>hundred and forty, and lastly, an instantaneous deflagration which<br/>might damage the firearms. On the other hand, the advantages of<br/>pyroxyle consist in this, that it is not injured by damp, that it<br/>does not make the gun-barrels dirty, and that its force is four<br/>times that of ordinary powder.<br/><br/>To make pyroxyle, the cotton must be immersed in the fuming<br/>azotic acid for a quarter of an hour, then washed in cold water and<br/>dried. Nothing could be more simple.<br/><br/>Cyrus Harding had only at his disposal the ordinary azotic acid<br/>and not the fuming or monohydrate azotic acid, that is to say, acid<br/>which emits white vapors when it comes in contact with damp air;<br/>but by substituting for the latter ordinary azotic acid, mixed, in<br/>the proportion of from three to five volumes of concentrated<br/>sulphuric acid, the engineer obtained the same result. The<br/>sportsmen of the island therefore soon had a perfectly prepared<br/>substance, which, employed discreetly, produced admirable<br/>results.<br/><br/>About this time the settlers cleared three acres of the plateau,<br/>and the rest was preserved in a wild state, for the benefit of the<br/>onagers. Several excursions were made into the Jacamar Wood and the<br/>forests of the Far West, and they brought back from thence a large<br/>collection of wild vegetables, spinach, cress, radishes, and<br/>turnips, which careful culture would soon improve, and which would<br/>temper the regimen on which the settlers had till then subsisted.<br/>Supplies of wood and coal were also carted. Each excursion was at<br/>the same time a means of improving the roads, which gradually<br/>became smoother under the wheels of the cart.<br/><br/>The rabbit-warren still continued to supply the larder of<br/>Granite House. As fortunately it was situated on the other side of<br/>Creek Glycerine, its inhabitants could not reach the plateau nor<br/>ravage the newly-made plantation. The oyster-bed among the rocks<br/>was frequently renewed and furnished excellent molluscs. Besides<br/>that, the fishing, either in the lake or the Mercy, was very<br/>profitable, for Pencroft had made some lines, armed with iron<br/>hooks, with which they frequently caught fine trout, and a species<br/>of fish whose silvery sides were speckled with yellow, and which<br/>were also extremely savory. Master Neb, who was skilled in the<br/>culinary art, knew how to vary agreeably the bill of fare. Bread<br/>alone was wanting at the table of the settlers, and as has been<br/>said, they felt this privation greatly.<br/><br/>The settlers hunted too the turtles which frequented the shores<br/>of Cape Mandible. At this place the beach was covered with little<br/>mounds, concealing perfectly spherical turtles' eggs, with white<br/>hard shells, the albumen of which does not coagulate as that of<br/>birds' eggs. They were hatched by the sun, and their number was<br/>naturally considerable, as each turtle can lay annually two hundred<br/>and fifty.<br/><br/>"A regular egg-field," observed Gideon Spilett, "and we have<br/>nothing to do but to pick them up."<br/><br/>But not being contented with simply the produce, they made chase<br/>after the producers, the result of which was that they were able to<br/>bring back to Granite House a dozen of these chelonians, which were<br/>really valuable from an alimentary point of view. The turtle soup,<br/>flavored with aromatic herbs, often gained well-merited praises for<br/>its preparer, Neb.<br/><br/>We must here mention another fortunate circumstance by which new<br/>stores for the winter were laid in. Shoals of salmon entered the<br/>Mercy, and ascended the country for several miles. It was the time<br/>at which the females, going to find suitable places in which to<br/>spawn, precede the males and make a great noise through the fresh<br/>water. A thousand of these fish, which measured about two feet and<br/>a half in length, came up the river, and a large quantity were<br/>retained by fixing dams across the stream. More than a hundred were<br/>thus taken, which were salted and stored for the time when winter,<br/>freezing up the streams, would render fishing impracticable. By<br/>this time the intelligent Jup was raised to the duty of valet. He<br/>had been dressed in a jacket, white linen breeches, and an apron,<br/>the pockets of which were his delight. The clever orang had been<br/>marvelously trained by Neb, and any one would have said that the<br/>Negro and the ape understood each other when they talked together.<br/>Jup had besides a real affection for Neb, and Neb returned it. When<br/>his services were not required, either for carrying wood or for<br/>climbing to the top of some tree, Jup passed the greatest part of<br/>his time in the kitchen, where he endeavored to imitate Neb in all<br/>that he saw him do. The black showed the greatest patience and even<br/>extreme zeal in instructing his pupil, and the pupil exhibited<br/>remarkable intelligence in profiting by the lessons he received<br/>from his master.<br/><br/>Judge then of the pleasure Master Jup gave to the inhabitants of<br/>Granite House when, without their having had any idea of it, he<br/>appeared one day, napkin on his arm, ready to wait at table. Quick,<br/>attentive, he acquitted himself perfectly, changing the plates,<br/>bringing dishes, pouring out water, all with a gravity which gave<br/>intense amusement to the settlers, and which enraptured<br/>Pencroft.<br/>
