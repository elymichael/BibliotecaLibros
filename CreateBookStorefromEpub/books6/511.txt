"The subterranean fires have therefore been smoldering for ten
weeks," resumed Gideon Spilett, "and it is not to be wondered at
that they now break out with such violence!"

"Do not you feel a certain vibration of the soil?" asked Cyrus
Harding.

"Yes," replied Gideon Spilett, "but there is a great difference
between that and an earthquake."

"I do not affirm that we are menaced with an earthquake,"
answered Cyrus Harding, "may God preserve us from that! No; these
vibrations are due to the effervescence of the central fire. The
crust of the earth is simply the shell of a boiler, and you know
that such a shell, under the pressure of steam, vibrates like a
sonorous plate. it is this effect which is being produced at this
moment."

"What magnificent flames!" exclaimed Herbert.

At this instant a kind of bouquet of flames shot forth from the
crater, the brilliancy of which was visible even through the
vapors. Thousands of luminous sheets and barbed tongues of fire
were cast in various directions. Some, extending beyond the dome of
smoke, dissipated it, leaving behind an incandescent powder. This
was accompanied by successive explosions, resembling the discharge
of a battery of machine-guns.

Cyrus Harding, the reporter, and Herbert, after spending an hour
on the plateau of Prospect Heights, again descended to the beach,
and returned to Granite House. The engineer was thoughtful and
preoccupied, so much so, indeed, that Gideon Spilett inquired if he
apprehended any immediate danger, of which the eruption might
directly or indirectly be the cause.

"Yes, and no," answered Cyrus Harding.

"Nevertheless," continued the reporter, "would not the greatest
misfortune which could happen to us be an earthquake which would
overturn the island? Now, I do not suppose that this is to be
feared, since the vapors and lava have found a free outlet."

"True," replied Cyrus Harding, "and I do not fear an earthquake
in the sense in which the term is commonly applied to convulsions
of the soil provoked by the expansion of subterranean gases. But
other causes may produce great disasters."
