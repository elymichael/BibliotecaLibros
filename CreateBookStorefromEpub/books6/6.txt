"Are we rising again?" "No. On the contrary." "Are we
descending?" "Worse than that, captain! we are falling!" "For
Heaven's sake heave out the ballast!" "There! the last sack is
empty!" "Does the balloon rise?" "No!" "I hear a noise like the
dashing of waves. The sea is below the car! It cannot be more than
500 feet from us!" "Overboard with every weight!&#160;â€¦
everything!"

Such were the loud and startling words which resounded through
the air, above the vast watery desert of the Pacific, about four
o'clock in the evening of the 23rd of March, 1865.

Few can possibly have forgotten the terrible storm from the
northeast, in the middle of the equinox of that year. The tempest
raged without intermission from the 18th to the 26th of March. Its
ravages were terrible in America, Europe, and Asia, covering a
distance of eighteen hundred miles, and extending obliquely to the
equator from the thirty-fifth north parallel to the fortieth south
parallel. Towns were overthrown, forests uprooted, coasts
devastated by the mountains of water which were precipitated on
them, vessels cast on the shore, which the published accounts
numbered by hundreds, whole districts leveled by waterspouts which
destroyed everything they passed over, several thousand people
crushed on land or drowned at sea; such were the traces of its
fury, left by this devastating tempest. It surpassed in disasters
those which so frightfully ravaged Havana and Guadalupe, one on the
25th of October, 1810, the other on the 26th of July, 1825.

But while so many catastrophes were taking place on land and at
sea, a drama not less exciting was being enacted in the agitated
air.

In fact, a balloon, as a ball might be carried on the summit of
a waterspout, had been taken into the circling movement of a column
of air and had traversed space at the rate of ninety miles an hour,
turning round and round as if seized by some aerial maelstrom.

Beneath the lower point of the balloon swung a car, containing
five passengers, scarcely visible in the midst of the thick vapor
mingled with spray which hung over the surface of the ocean.
