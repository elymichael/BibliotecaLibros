It was then half-past four. In order to prepare for dinner it<br/>was necessary that the settlers should return to their dwelling.<br/>The little band retraced their steps, therefore, and by the left<br/>bank of the Mercy, Cyrus Harding and his companions arrived at the<br/>Chimneys.<br/><br/>The fire was lighted, and Neb and Pencroft, on whom the<br/>functions of cooks naturally devolved, to the one in his quality of<br/>Negro, to the other in that of sailor, quickly prepared some<br/>broiled agouti, to which they did great justice.<br/><br/>The repast at length terminated; at the moment when each one was<br/>about to give himself up to sleep, Cyrus Harding drew from his<br/>pocket little specimens of different sorts of minerals, and just<br/>said,â€”<br/><br/>"My friends, this is iron mineral, this a pyrite, this is clay,<br/>this is lime, and this is coal. Nature gives us these things. It is<br/>our business to make a right use of them. To-morrow we will<br/>commence operations."<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
