<br/>The balloon, inflated on the great square of Richmond, was ready<br/>to depart on the first abatement of the wind, and, as may be<br/>supposed, the impatience among the besieged to see the storm<br/>moderate was very great.<br/><br/>The 18th, the 19th of March passed without any alteration in the<br/>weather. There was even great difficulty in keeping the balloon<br/>fastened to the ground, as the squalls dashed it furiously<br/>about.<br/><br/>The night of the 19th passed, but the next morning the storm<br/>blew with redoubled force. The departure of the balloon was<br/>impossible.<br/><br/>On that day the engineer, Cyrus Harding, was accosted in one of<br/>the streets of Richmond by a person whom he did not in the least<br/>know. This was a sailor named Pencroft, a man of about thirty-five<br/>or forty years of age, strongly built, very sunburnt, and possessed<br/>of a pair of bright sparkling eyes and a remarkably good<br/>physiognomy. Pencroft was an American from the North, who had<br/>sailed all the ocean over, and who had gone through every possible<br/>and almost impossible adventure that a being with two feet and no<br/>wings would encounter. It is needless to say that he was a bold,<br/>dashing fellow, ready to dare anything and was astonished at<br/>nothing. Pencroft at the beginning of the year had gone to Richmond<br/>on business, with a young boy of fifteen from New Jersey, son of a<br/>former captain, an orphan, whom he loved as if he had been his own<br/>child. Not having been able to leave the town before the first<br/>operations of the siege, he found himself shut up, to his great<br/>disgust; but, not accustomed to succumb to difficulties, he<br/>resolved to escape by some means or other. He knew the<br/>engineer-officer by reputation; he knew with what impatience that<br/>determined man chafed under his restraint. On this day he did not,<br/>therefore, hesitate to accost him, saying, without circumlocution,<br/>"Have you had enough of Richmond, captain?"<br/><br/>The engineer looked fixedly at the man who spoke, and who added,<br/>in a low voice,â€”<br/><br/>"Captain Harding, will you try to escape?"<br/><br/>"When?" asked the engineer quickly, and it was evident that this<br/>question was uttered without consideration, for he had not yet<br/>examined the stranger who addressed him. But after having with a<br/>penetrating eye observed the open face of the sailor, he was<br/>convinced that he had before him an honest man.<br/><br/>"Who are you?" he asked briefly.<br/><br/>Pencroft made himself known.<br/><br/>"Well," replied Harding, "and in what way do you propose to<br/>escape?"<br/><br/>
