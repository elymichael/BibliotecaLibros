about to fly at the moment when the settlers arrived on the field
of battle, but Herbert, clinging to him, cried,—

"No, no! you shall not go!"

Harding advanced towards the stranger, who frowned when he saw
him approaching. The blood flowed from his shoulder under his torn
shirt, but he took no notice of it.

"My friend," said Cyrus Harding, "we have just contracted a debt
of gratitude to you. To save our boy you have risked your
life!"

"My life!" murmured the stranger. "What is that worth? Less than
nothing!"

"You are wounded?"

"It is no matter."

"Will you give me your hand?"

And as Herbert endeavored to. seize the hand which had just
saved him, the stranger folded his arms, his chest heaved, his look
darkened, and he appeared to wish to escape, but making a violent
effort over himself, and in an abrupt tone,—

"Who are you?" he asked, "and what do you claim to be to
me?"
