<br/>"No," said Spilett more than once, "I have never thought of such<br/>a contingency without shuddering!"<br/><br/>"And yet, if it had been necessary to operate," said Harding one<br/>day to him, "you would not have hesitated?"<br/><br/>"No, Cyrus!" said Gideon Spilett, "but thank God that we have<br/>been spared this complication!"<br/><br/>As in so many other conjectures, the colonists had appealed to<br/>the logic of that simple good sense of which they had made use so<br/>often, and once more, thanks to their general knowledge, it had<br/>succeeded! But might not a time come when all their science would<br/>be at fault? They were alone on the island. Now, men in all states<br/>of society are necessary to each other. Cyrus Harding knew this<br/>well, and sometimes he asked if some circumstance might not occur<br/>which they would be powerless to surmount. It appeared to him<br/>besides, that he and his companions, till then so fortunate, had<br/>entered into an unlucky period. During the two years and a half<br/>which had elapsed since their escape from Richmond, it might be<br/>said that they had had everything their own way. The island had<br/>abundantly supplied them with minerals, vegetables, animals, and as<br/>Nature had constantly loaded them, their science had known how to<br/>take advantage of what she offered them.<br/><br/>The wellbeing of the colony was therefore complete. Moreover, in<br/>certain occurrences an inexplicable influence had come to their<br/>aid!â€¦ But all that could only be for a time.<br/><br/>In short, Cyrus Harding believed that fortune had turned against<br/>them.<br/><br/>In fact, the convicts' ship had appeared in the waters of the<br/>island, and if the pirates had been, so to speak, miraculously<br/>destroyed, six of them, at least, had escaped the catastrophe. They<br/>had disembarked on the island, and it was almost impossible to get<br/>at the five who survived. Ayrton had no doubt been murdered by<br/>these wretches, who possessed firearms, and at the first use that<br/>they had made of them, Herbert had fallen, wounded almost mortally.<br/>Were these the first blows aimed by adverse fortune at the<br/>colonists? This was often asked by Harding. This was often repeated<br/>by the reporter; and it appeared to him also that the intervention,<br/>so strange, yet so efficacious, which till then had served them so<br/>well, had now failed them. Had this mysterious being, whatever he<br/>was, whose existence could not be denied, abandoned the island? Had<br/>he in his turn succumbed?<br/><br/>No reply was possible to these questions. But it must not be<br/>imagined that because Harding and his companions spoke of these<br/>things, they were men to despair. Far from that. They looked their<br/>situation in the face, they analyzed the chances, they prepared<br/>themselves for any event, they stood firm and straight before the<br/>future, and if adversity was at last to strike them, it would find<br/>in them men prepared to struggle against it.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
