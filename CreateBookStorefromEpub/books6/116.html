<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>16<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>It was the 6th of May, a day which corresponds to the 6th of<br/>November in the countries of the Northern Hemisphere. The sky had<br/>been obscured for some days, and it was of importance to make<br/>preparations for the winter. However, the temperature was not as<br/>yet much lower, and a centigrade thermometer, transported to<br/>Lincoln Island, would still have marked an average of ten to twelve<br/>degrees above zero. This was not surprising, since Lincoln Island,<br/>probably situated between the thirty-fifth and fortieth parallel,<br/>would be subject, in the Southern Hemisphere, to the same climate<br/>as Sicily or Greece in the Northern Hemisphere. But as Greece and<br/>Sicily have severe cold, producing snow and ice, so doubtless would<br/>Lincoln Island in the severest part of the winter and it was<br/>advisable to provide against it.<br/><br/>In any case if cold did not yet threaten them, the rainy season<br/>would begin, and on this lonely island, exposed to all the fury of<br/>the elements, in mid-ocean, bad weather would be frequent, and<br/>probably terrible. The question of a more comfortable dwelling than<br/>the Chimneys must therefore be seriously considered and promptly<br/>resolved on.<br/><br/>Pencroft, naturally, had some predilection for the retreat which<br/>he had discovered, but he well understood that another must be<br/>found. The Chimneys had been already visited by the sea, under<br/>circumstances which are known, and it would not do to be exposed<br/>again to a similar accident.<br/><br/>"Besides," added Cyrus Harding, who this day was talking of<br/>these things with his companions, "we have some precautions to<br/>take."<br/><br/>"Why? The island is not inhabited," said the reporter.<br/><br/>"That is probable," replied the engineer, "although we have not<br/>yet explored the interior; but if no human beings are found, I fear<br/>that dangerous animals may abound. It is necessary to guard against<br/>a possible attack, so that we shall not be obliged to watch every<br/>night, or to keep up a fire. And then, my friends, we must foresee<br/>everything. We are here in a part of the Pacific often frequented<br/>by Malay piratesâ€”"<br/><br/>
