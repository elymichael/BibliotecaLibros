"And now," said Gideon Spilett, "since the jaguar has left its
abode, I do not see, my friends, why we should not take possession
of it for the night."

"But others may come," said Pencroft.

"It will be enough to light a fire at the entrance of the
cavern," said the reporter, "and no wild beasts will dare to cross
the threshold."

"Into the jaguar's house, then!" replied the sailor, dragging
after him the body of the animal.

While Neb skinned the jaguar, his companions collected an
abundant supply of dry wood from the forest, which they heaped up
at the cave.

Cyrus Harding, seeing the clump of bamboos, cut a quantity,
which he mingled with the other fuel.

This done, they entered the grotto, of which the floor was
strewn with bones, the guns were carefully loaded, in case of a
sudden attack, they had supper, and then just before they lay down
to rest, the heap of wood piled at the entrance was set fire to.
Immediately, a regular explosion, or rather a series of reports,
broke the silence! The noise was caused by the bamboos, which, as
the flames reached them, exploded like fireworks. The noise was
enough to terrify even the boldest of wild beasts.

It was not the engineer who had invented this way of causing
loud explosions, for, according to Marco Polo, the Tartars have
employed it for many centuries to drive away from their encampments
the formidable wild beasts of Central Asia.
