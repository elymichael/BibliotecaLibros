"No," replied Pencroft, "for the sky was covered with thick
clouds, and at any rate a star would not have been so low on the
horizon. But Mr. Spilett saw it as well as we, and he will confirm
our words."

"I will add," said the reporter, "that the fire was very bright,
and that it shot up like a sheet of lightning."

"Yes, yes! exactly," added Herbert, "and it was certainly placed
on the heights of Granite House."

"Well, my friends," replied Cyrus Harding, "during the night of
the 19th of October, neither Neb nor I lighted any fire on the
coast."

"You did not!" exclaimed Pencroft, in the height of his
astonishment, not being able to finish his sentence.

"We did not leave Granite House," answered Cyrus Harding, "and
if a fire appeared on the coast, it was lighted by another hand
than ours!"

Pencroft, Herbert, and Neb were stupefied. No illusion could be
possible, and a fire had actually met their eyes during the night
of the 19th of October. Yes! they had to acknowledge it, a mystery
existed! An inexplicable influence, evidently favorable to the
colonists, but very irritating to their curiosity, was executed
always in the nick of time on Lincoln Island. Could there be some
being hidden in its profoundest recesses? It was necessary at any
cost to ascertain this.

Harding also reminded his companions of the singular behavior of
Top and Jup when they prowled round the mouth of the well, which
placed Granite House in communication with the sea, and he told
them that he had explored the well, without discovering anything
suspicious. The final resolve taken, in consequence of this
conversation, by all the members of the colony, was that as soon as
the fine season returned they would thoroughly search the whole of
the island.

But from that day Pencroft appeared to be anxious. He felt as if
the island which he had made his own personal property belonged to
him entirely no longer, and that he shared it with another master,
to whom, willing or not, he felt subject. Neb and he often talked
of those unaccountable things, and both, their natures inclining
them to the marvelous, were not far from believing that Lincoln
Island was under the dominion of some supernatural power.

In the meanwhile, the bad weather came with the month of May,
the November of the northern zones. It appeared that the winter
would be severe and forward. The preparations for the winter season
were therefore commenced without delay.
