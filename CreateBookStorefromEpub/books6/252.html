Pencroft jumped up, and his great good-natured face grew pale<br/>when he saw the reporter presenting him with a ready-filled pipe,<br/>and Herbert with a glowing coal.<br/><br/>The sailor endeavored to speak, but could not get out a word;<br/>so, seizing the pipe, he carried it to his lips, then applying the<br/>coal, he drew five or six great whiffs. A fragrant blue cloud soon<br/>arose, and from its depths a voice was heard repeating<br/>excitedly,â€”<br/><br/>"Tobacco! real tobacco!"<br/><br/>"Yes, Pencroft," returned Cyrus Harding, "and very good tobacco<br/>too!"<br/><br/>"O, divine Providence; sacred Author of all things!" cried the<br/>sailor. "Nothing more is now wanting to our island."<br/><br/>And Pencroft smoked, and smoked, and smoked.<br/><br/>"And who made this discovery?" he asked at length. "You,<br/>Herbert, no doubt?"<br/><br/>"No, Pencroft, it was Mr. Spilett."<br/><br/>"Mr. Spilett!" exclaimed the sailor, seizing the reporter, and<br/>clasping him to his breast with such a squeeze that he had never<br/>felt anything like it before.<br/><br/>"Oh Pencroft," said Spilett, recovering his breath at last, "a<br/>truce for one moment. You must share your gratitude with Herbert,<br/>who recognized the plant, with Cyrus, who prepared it, and with<br/>Neb, who took a great deal of trouble to keep our secret."<br/><br/>"Well, my friends, I will repay you some day," replied the<br/>sailor. "Now we are friends for life."<br/>
