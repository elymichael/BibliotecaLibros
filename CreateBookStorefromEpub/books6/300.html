"No, captain," replied the sailor. "Half of the time she is<br/>stranded on the sand, and that works her. She is a famous craft,<br/>you see, and she behaved admirably during the squall which struck<br/>us on our return."<br/><br/>"Could she not float in the river?"<br/><br/>"No doubt, captain, she could; but there is no shelter there,<br/>and in the east winds, I think that the 'Bonadventure' would suffer<br/>much from the surf."<br/><br/>"Well, where would you put her, Pencroft?"<br/><br/>"In Port Balloon," replied the sailor. "That little creek, shut<br/>in by rocks, seems to me to be just the harbor we want."<br/><br/>"Is it not rather far?"<br/><br/>"Pooh! it is not more than three miles from Granite House, and<br/>we have a fine straight road to take us there!"<br/><br/>"Do it then, Pencroft, and take your 'Bonadventure' there,"<br/>replied the engineer, "and yet I would rather have her under our<br/>more immediate protection. When we have time, we must make a little<br/>harbor for her."<br/><br/>"Famous!" exclaimed Pencroft. "A harbor with a lighthouse, a<br/>pier, and dock! Ah! really with you, captain, everything becomes<br/>easy."<br/><br/>"Yes, my brave Pencroft," answered the engineer, "but on<br/>condition, however, that you help me, for you do as much as three<br/>men in all our work."<br/><br/>Herbert and the sailor then re-embarked on board the<br/>"Bonadventure," the anchor was weighed, the sail hoisted, and the<br/>wind drove her rapidly towards Claw Cape. Two hours after, she was<br/>reposing on the tranquil waters of Port Balloon.<br/>
