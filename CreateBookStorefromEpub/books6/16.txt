Five days had passed when a partial clearing allowed them to see
the wide extending ocean beneath their feet, now lashed into the
maddest fury by the gale.

Our readers will recollect what befell these five daring
individuals who set out on their hazardous expedition in the
balloon on the 20th of March. Five days afterwards four of them
were thrown on a desert coast, seven thousand miles from their
country! But one of their number was missing, the man who was to be
their guide, their leading spirit, the engineer, Captain Harding!
The instant they had recovered their feet, they all hurried to the
beach in the hopes of rendering him assistance.
