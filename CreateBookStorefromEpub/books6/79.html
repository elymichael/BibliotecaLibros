<br/>"And consequently an area?"<br/><br/>"That is difficult to estimate," replied the engineer, "for it<br/>is so uneven."<br/><br/>If Cyrus Harding was not mistaken in his calculation, the island<br/>had almost the extent of Malta or Zante, in the Mediterranean, but<br/>it was at the same time much more irregular and less rich in capes,<br/>promontories, points, bays, or creeks. Its strange form caught the<br/>eye, and when Gideon Spilett, on the engineer's advice, had drawn<br/>the outline, they found that it resembled some fantastic animal, a<br/>monstrous leviathan, which lay sleeping on the surface of the<br/>Pacific.<br/><br/>This was in fact the exact shape of the island, which it is of<br/>consequence to know, and a tolerably correct map of it was<br/>immediately drawn by the reporter.<br/><br/>The east part of the shore, where the castaways had landed,<br/>formed a wide bay, terminated by a sharp cape, which had been<br/>concealed by a high point from Pencroft on his first exploration.<br/>At the northeast two other capes closed the bay, and between them<br/>ran a narrow gulf, which looked like the half-open jaws of a<br/>formidable dog-fish.<br/><br/>From the northeast to the southwest the coast was rounded, like<br/>the flattened cranium of an animal, rising again, forming a sort of<br/>protuberance which did not give any particular shape to this part<br/>of the island, of which the center was occupied by the volcano.<br/><br/>From this point the shore ran pretty regularly north and south,<br/>broken at two-thirds of its perimeter by a narrow creek, from which<br/>it ended in a long tail, similar to the caudal appendage of a<br/>gigantic alligator.<br/><br/>This tail formed a regular peninsula, which stretched more than<br/>thirty miles into the sea, reckoning from the cape southeast of the<br/>island, already mentioned; it curled round, making an open<br/>roadstead, which marked out the lower shore of this<br/>strangely-formed land.<br/><br/>At the narrowest part, that is to say between the Chimneys and<br/>the creek on the western shore, which corresponded to it in<br/>latitude, the island only measured ten miles; but its greatest<br/>length, from the jaws at the northeast to the extremity of the tail<br/>of the southwest, was not less than thirty miles.<br/><br/>As to the interior of the island, its general aspect was this,<br/>very woody throughout the southern part from the mountain to the<br/>shore, and arid and sandy in the northern part. Between the volcano<br/>and the east coast Cyrus Harding and his companions were surprised<br/>to see a lake, bordered with green trees, the existence of which<br/>they had not suspected. Seen from this height, the lake appeared to<br/>be on the same level as the ocean, but, on reflection, the engineer<br/>explained to his companions that the altitude of this little sheet<br/>of water must be about three hundred feet, because the plateau,<br/>which was its basin, was but a prolongation of the coast.<br/><br/>
