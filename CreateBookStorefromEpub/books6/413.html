"Into the corral, then!" said Pencroft.<br/><br/>"In a moment," said Harding.<br/><br/>And he ran round the left corner of the palisade. There he found<br/>a convict, who aiming at him, sent a ball through his hat. In a few<br/>seconds, before he had even time to fire his second barrel, he<br/>fell, struck to the heart by Harding's dagger, more sure even than<br/>his gun.<br/><br/>During this time, Gideon Spilett and the sailor hoisted<br/>themselves over the palisade, leaped into the enclosure, threw down<br/>the props which supported the inner door, ran into the empty house,<br/>and soon, poor Herbert was lying on Ayrton's bed. In a few moments,<br/>Harding was by his side.<br/><br/>On seeing Herbert senseless, the sailor's grief was<br/>terrible.<br/><br/>He sobbed, he cried, he tried to beat his head against the<br/>wall.<br/><br/>Neither the engineer nor the reporter could calm him. They<br/>themselves were choked with emotion. They could not speak.<br/><br/>However, they knew that it depended on them to rescue from death<br/>the poor boy who was suffering beneath their eyes. Gideon Spilett<br/>had not passed through the many incidents by which his life had<br/>been checkered without acquiring some slight knowledge of medicine.<br/>He knew a little of everything, and several times he had been<br/>obliged to attend to wounds produced either by a sword-bayonet or<br/>shot. Assisted by Cyrus Harding, he proceeded to render the aid<br/>Herbert required.<br/><br/>The reporter was immediately struck by the complete stupor in<br/>which Herbert lay, a stupor owing either to the hemorrhage, or to<br/>the shock, the ball having struck a bone with sufficient force to<br/>produce a violent concussion.<br/><br/>Herbert was deadly pale, and his pulse so feeble that Spilett<br/>only felt it beat at long intervals, as if it was on the point of<br/>stopping.<br/><br/>These symptoms were very serious.<br/>
