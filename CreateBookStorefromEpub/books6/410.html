The colonists walked rapidly and in silence. Top preceded them,<br/>sometimes running on the road, sometimes taking a ramble into the<br/>wood, but always quiet and not appearing to fear anything unusual.<br/>And they could be sure that the faithful dog would not allow them<br/>to be surprised, but would bark at the least appearance of<br/>danger.<br/><br/>Cyrus Harding and his companions followed beside the road the<br/>wire which connected the corral with Granite House. After walking<br/>for nearly two miles, they had not as yet discovered any<br/>explanation of the difficulty. The posts were in good order, the<br/>wire regularly extended. However, at that moment the engineer<br/>observed that the wire appeared to be slack, and on arriving at<br/>post No. 74, Herbert, who was in advance stopped, exclaiming,â€”<br/><br/>"The wire is broken!"<br/><br/>His companions hurried forward and arrived at the spot where the<br/>lad was standing. The post was rooted up and lying across the path.<br/>The unexpected explanation of the difficulty was here, and it was<br/>evident that the despatches from Granite House had not been<br/>received at the corral, nor those from the corral at Granite<br/>House.<br/><br/>"It wasn't the wind that blew down this post," observed<br/>Pencroft.<br/><br/>"No," replied Gideon Spilett. "The earth has been dug up round<br/>its foot, and it has been torn up by the hand of man."<br/><br/>"Besides, the wire is broken," added Herbert, showing that the<br/>wire had been snapped.<br/><br/>"Is the fracture recent?" asked Harding.<br/><br/>"Yes," answered Herbert, "it has certainly been done quite<br/>lately."<br/><br/>"To the corral! to the corral!" exclaimed the sailor.<br/><br/>The colonists were now half way between Granite House and the<br/>corral, having still two miles and a half to go. They pressed<br/>forward with redoubled speed.<br/>
