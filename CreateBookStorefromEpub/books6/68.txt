The hunters had scarcely entered the bushes when they saw Top
engaged in a struggle with an animal which he was holding by the
ear. This quadruped was a sort of pig nearly two feet and a half
long, of a blackish brown color, lighter below, having hard scanty
hair; its toes, then strongly fixed in the ground, seemed to be
united by a membrane. Herbert recognized in this animal the
capybara, that is to say, one of the largest members of the rodent
order.

Meanwhile, the capybara did not struggle against the dog. It
stupidly rolled its eyes, deeply buried in a thick bed of fat.
Perhaps it saw men for the first time.

However, Neb having tightened his grasp on his stick, was just
going to fell the pig, when the latter, tearing itself from Top's
teeth, by which it was only held by the tip of its ear, uttered a
vigorous grunt, rushed upon Herbert, almost overthrew him, and
disappeared in the wood.

"The rascal!" cried Pencroft.

All three directly darted after Top, but at the moment when they
joined him the animal had disappeared under the waters of a large
pond shaded by venerable pines.

Neb, Herbert, and Pencroft stopped, motionless. Top plunged into
the water, but the capybara, hidden at the bottom of the pond, did
not appear.

"Let us wait," said the boy, "for he will soon come to the
surface to breathe."

"Won't he drown?" asked Neb.

"No," replied Herbert, "since he has webbed feet, and is almost
an amphibious animal. But watch him."

Top remained in the water. Pencroft and his two companions went
to different parts of the bank, so as to cut off the retreat of the
capybara, which the dog was looking for beneath the water.
