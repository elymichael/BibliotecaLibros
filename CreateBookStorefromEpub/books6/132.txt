"Without any doubt, the island, continents, and the world
itself," replied the engineer. "It is only a question of
quantity."

"Then could you not use this nitro-glycerine for loading
firearms?" asked the sailor.

"No, Pencroft; for it is too explosive a substance. But it would
be easy to make some guncotton, or even ordinary powder, as we have
azotic acid, saltpeter, sulphur, and coal. Unhappily, it is the
guns which we have not got.

"Oh, captain," replied the sailor, "with a little
determinationâ€”"

Pencroft had erased the word "impossible" from the dictionary of
Lincoln Island.

The settlers, having arrived at Prospect Heights, went
immediately towards that point of the lake near which was the old
opening now uncovered. This outlet had now become practicable,
since the water no longer rushed through it, and it would doubtless
be easy to explore the interior.

In a few minutes the settlers had reached the lower point of the
lake, and a glance showed them that the object had been
attained.

In fact, in the side of the lake, and now above the surface of
the water, appeared the long-looked-for opening. A narrow ridge,
left bare by the retreat of the water, allowed them to approach it.
This orifice was nearly twenty feet in width, but scarcely two in
height. It was like the mouth of a drain at the edge of the
pavement, and therefore did not offer an easy passage to the
settlers; but Neb and Pencroft, taking their pickaxes, soon made it
of a suitable height.

The engineer then approached, and found that the sides of the
opening, in its upper part at least, had not a slope of more than
from thirty to thirty-five degrees. It was therefore practicable,
and, provided that the declivity did not increase, it would be easy
to descend even to the level of the sea. If then, as was probable,
some vast cavity existed in the interior of the granite, it might,
perhaps, be of great use.

"Well, captain, what are we stopping for?" asked the sailor,
impatient to enter the narrow passage. You see Top has got before
us!"

"Very well," replied the engineer. "But we must see our way.
Neb, go and cut some resinous branches."
