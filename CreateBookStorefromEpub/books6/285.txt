Pencroft, Herbert, and Gideon Spilett remained silent in the
midst of the darkness.

Pencroft shouted loudly.

No reply was made.

The sailor then struck a light and set fire to a twig. This
lighted for a minute a small room, which appeared perfectly empty.
At the back was a rude fireplace, with a few cold cinders,
supporting an armful of dry wood. Pencroft threw the blazing twig
on it, the wood crackled and gave forth a bright light.

The sailor and his two companions then perceived a disordered
bed, of which the damp and yellow coverlets proved that it had not
been used for a long time. In the corner of the fireplace were two
kettles, covered with rust, and an overthrown pot. A cupboard, with
a few moldy sailor's clothes; on the table a tin plate and a Bible,
eaten away by damp; in a corner a few tools, a spade, pickaxe, two
fowling-pieces, one of which was broken; on a plank, forming a
shelf, stood a barrel of powder, still untouched, a barrel of shot,
and several boxes of caps, all thickly covered with dust,
accumulated, perhaps, by many long years.

"There is no one here," said the reporter.
