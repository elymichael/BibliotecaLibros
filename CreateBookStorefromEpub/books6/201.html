<br/>"Back!" cried Pencroft. "Our guns are only loaded with small<br/>shot, and beasts which can roar as loud as that would care no more<br/>for it than for grains of salt!" And the sailor, seizing Herbert by<br/>the arm, dragged him behind a rock, just as a magnificent animal<br/>showed itself at the entrance of the cavern.<br/><br/>It was a jaguar of a size at least equal to its Asiatic<br/>congeners, that is to say, it measured five feet from the extremity<br/>of its head to the beginning of its tail. The yellow color of its<br/>hair was relieved by streaks and regular oblong spots of black,<br/>which contrasted with the white of its chest. Herbert recognized it<br/>as the ferocious rival of the tiger, as formidable as the puma,<br/>which is the rival of the largest wolf!<br/><br/>The jaguar advanced and gazed around him with blazing eyes, his<br/>hair bristling as if this was not the first time he had scented<br/>men.<br/><br/>At this moment the reporter appeared round a rock, and Herbert,<br/>thinking that he had not seen the jaguar, was about to rush towards<br/>him, when Gideon Spilett signed to him to remain where he was. This<br/>was not his first tiger, and advancing to within ten feet of the<br/>animal he remained motionless, his gun to his shoulder, without<br/>moving a muscle. The jaguar collected itself for a spring, but at<br/>that moment a shot struck it in the eyes, and it fell dead.<br/><br/>Herbert and Pencroft rushed towards the jaguar. Neb and Harding<br/>also ran up, and they remained for some instants contemplating the<br/>animal as it lay stretched on the ground, thinking that its<br/>magnificent skin would be a great ornament to the hall at Granite<br/>House.<br/><br/>"Oh, Mr. Spilett, how I admire and envy you!" cried Herbert, in<br/>a fit of very natural enthusiasm.<br/><br/>"Well, my boy," replied the reporter, "you could have done the<br/>same."<br/><br/>"I! with such coolness!â€”"<br/><br/>"Imagine to yourself, Herbert, that the jaguar is only a hare,<br/>and you would fire as quietly as possible."<br/><br/>"That is," rejoined Pencroft, "that it is not more dangerous<br/>than a hare!"<br/><br/>
