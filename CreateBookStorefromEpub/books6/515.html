<br/>"Yes, instinct speaks through them, and instinct is never<br/>deceived."<br/><br/>"Are you ready?"<br/><br/>"Take a lamp, Ayrton," answered the engineer; "we will start at<br/>once."<br/><br/>Ayrton did as desired. The onagers, unharnessed, roamed in the<br/>corral. The gate was secured on the outside, and Cyrus Harding,<br/>preceding Ayrton, took the narrow path which led westward to the<br/>shore.<br/><br/>The soil they walked upon was choked with the pulverized matter<br/>fallen from the cloud. No quadruped appeared in the woods. Even the<br/>birds had fled. Sometimes a passing breeze raised the covering of<br/>ashes, and the two colonists, enveloped in a whirlwind of dust,<br/>lost sight of each other. They were then careful to cover their<br/>eyes and mouths with handkerchiefs, for they ran the risk of being<br/>blinded and suffocated.<br/><br/>It was impossible for Cyrus Harding and Ayrton, with these<br/>impediments, to make rapid progress. Moreover, the atmosphere was<br/>close, as if the oxygen had been partly burned up, and had become<br/>unfit for respiration. At every hundred paces they were obliged to<br/>stop to take breath. It was therefore past ten o'clock when the<br/>engineer and his companion reached the crest of the enormous mass<br/>of rocks of basalt and porphyry which composed the northwest coast<br/>of the island.<br/><br/>Ayrton and Cyrus Harding commenced the descent of this abrupt<br/>declivity, following almost step for step the difficult path which,<br/>during that stormy night, had led them to Dakkar Grotto. In open<br/>day the descent was less perilous, and, besides, the bed of ashes<br/>which covered the polished surface of the rock enabled them to make<br/>their footing more secure.<br/><br/>The ridge at the end of the shore, about forty feet in height,<br/>was soon reached. Cyrus Harding recollected that this elevation<br/>gradually sloped towards the level of the sea. Although the tide<br/>was at present low, no beach could he seen, and the waves,<br/>thickened by the volcanic dust, beat upon the basaltic rocks.<br/><br/>Cyrus Harding and Ayrton found without difficulty the entrance<br/>to Dakkar Grotto, and paused for a moment at the last rock before<br/>it.<br/><br/>"The iron boat should be there," said the engineer.<br/><br/>
