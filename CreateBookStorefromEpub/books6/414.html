<br/>Herbert's chest was laid bare, and the blood having been<br/>stanched with handkerchiefs, it was bathed with cold water.<br/><br/>The contusion, or rather the contused wound appeared,â€”an oval<br/>below the chest between the third and fourth ribs. It was there<br/>that Herbert had been hit by the bullet.<br/><br/>Cyrus Harding and Gideon Spilett then turned the poor boy over;<br/>as they did so, he uttered a moan so feeble that they almost<br/>thought it was his last sigh.<br/><br/>Herberts back was covered with blood from another contused<br/>wound, by which the ball had immediately escaped.<br/><br/>"God be praised!" said the reporter, "the ball is not in the<br/>body, and we shall not have to extract it."<br/><br/>"But the heart?" asked Harding.<br/><br/>"The heart has not been touched; if it had been, Herbert would<br/>be dead!"<br/><br/>"Dead!" exclaimed Pencroft, with a groan.<br/><br/>The sailor had only heard the last words uttered by the<br/>reporter.<br/><br/>"No, Pencroft," replied Cyrus Harding, "no! He is not dead. His<br/>pulse still beats. He has even uttered a moan. But for your boy's<br/>sake, calm yourself. We have need of all our self-possession."<br/><br/>
