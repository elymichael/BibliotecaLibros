Pencroft jumped up, and his great good-natured face grew pale
when he saw the reporter presenting him with a ready-filled pipe,
and Herbert with a glowing coal.

The sailor endeavored to speak, but could not get out a word;
so, seizing the pipe, he carried it to his lips, then applying the
coal, he drew five or six great whiffs. A fragrant blue cloud soon
arose, and from its depths a voice was heard repeating
excitedly,â€”

"Tobacco! real tobacco!"

"Yes, Pencroft," returned Cyrus Harding, "and very good tobacco
too!"

"O, divine Providence; sacred Author of all things!" cried the
sailor. "Nothing more is now wanting to our island."

And Pencroft smoked, and smoked, and smoked.

"And who made this discovery?" he asked at length. "You,
Herbert, no doubt?"

"No, Pencroft, it was Mr. Spilett."

"Mr. Spilett!" exclaimed the sailor, seizing the reporter, and
clasping him to his breast with such a squeeze that he had never
felt anything like it before.

"Oh Pencroft," said Spilett, recovering his breath at last, "a
truce for one moment. You must share your gratitude with Herbert,
who recognized the plant, with Cyrus, who prepared it, and with
Neb, who took a great deal of trouble to keep our secret."

"Well, my friends, I will repay you some day," replied the
sailor. "Now we are friends for life."
