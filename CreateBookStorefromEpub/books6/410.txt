The colonists walked rapidly and in silence. Top preceded them,
sometimes running on the road, sometimes taking a ramble into the
wood, but always quiet and not appearing to fear anything unusual.
And they could be sure that the faithful dog would not allow them
to be surprised, but would bark at the least appearance of
danger.

Cyrus Harding and his companions followed beside the road the
wire which connected the corral with Granite House. After walking
for nearly two miles, they had not as yet discovered any
explanation of the difficulty. The posts were in good order, the
wire regularly extended. However, at that moment the engineer
observed that the wire appeared to be slack, and on arriving at
post No. 74, Herbert, who was in advance stopped, exclaiming,â€”

"The wire is broken!"

His companions hurried forward and arrived at the spot where the
lad was standing. The post was rooted up and lying across the path.
The unexpected explanation of the difficulty was here, and it was
evident that the despatches from Granite House had not been
received at the corral, nor those from the corral at Granite
House.

"It wasn't the wind that blew down this post," observed
Pencroft.

"No," replied Gideon Spilett. "The earth has been dug up round
its foot, and it has been torn up by the hand of man."

"Besides, the wire is broken," added Herbert, showing that the
wire had been snapped.

"Is the fracture recent?" asked Harding.

"Yes," answered Herbert, "it has certainly been done quite
lately."

"To the corral! to the corral!" exclaimed the sailor.

The colonists were now half way between Granite House and the
corral, having still two miles and a half to go. They pressed
forward with redoubled speed.
