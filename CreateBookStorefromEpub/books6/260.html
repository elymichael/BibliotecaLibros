<br/>"Water!" cried Pencroft, "water as fuel for steamers and<br/>engines! water to heat water!"<br/><br/>"Yes, but water decomposed into its primitive elements," replied<br/>Cyrus Harding, "and decomposed doubtless, by electricity, which<br/>will then have become a powerful and manageable force, for all<br/>great discoveries, by some inexplicable laws, appear to agree and<br/>become complete at the same time. Yes, my friends, I believe that<br/>water will one day be employed as fuel, that hydrogen and oxygen<br/>which constitute it, used singly or together, will furnish an<br/>inexhaustible source of heat and light, of an intensity of which<br/>coal is not capable. Some day the coalrooms of steamers and the<br/>tenders of locomotives will, instead of coal, be stored with these<br/>two condensed gases, which will burn in the furnaces with enormous<br/>calorific power. There is, therefore, nothing to fear. As long as<br/>the earth is inhabited it will supply the wants of its inhabitants,<br/>and there will be no want of either light or heat as long as the<br/>productions of the vegetable, mineral or animal kingdoms do not<br/>fail us. I believe, then, that when the deposits of coal are<br/>exhausted we shall heat and warm ourselves with water. Water will<br/>be the coal of the future."<br/><br/>"I should like to see that," observed the sailor.<br/><br/>"You were born too soon, Pencroft," returned Neb, who only took<br/>part in the discussion by these words.<br/><br/>However, it was not Neb's speech which interrupted the<br/>conversation, but Top's barking, which broke out again with that<br/>strange intonation which had before perplexed the engineer. At the<br/>same time Top began to run round the mouth of the well, which<br/>opened at the extremity of the interior passage.<br/><br/>"What can Top be barking in that way for?" asked Pencroft.<br/><br/>"And Jup be growling like that?" added Herbert.<br/><br/>In fact the orang, joining the dog, gave unequivocal signs of<br/>agitation, and, singular to say, the two animals appeared more<br/>uneasy than angry.<br/><br/>"It is evident," said Gideon Spilett, "that this well is in<br/>direct communication with the sea, and that some marine animal<br/>comes from time to time to breathe at the bottom."<br/><br/>"That's evident," replied the sailor, "and there can be no other<br/>explanation to give. Quiet there, Top!" added Pencroft, turning to<br/>the dog, "and you, Jup, be off to your room!"<br/><br/>
