<br/>"The 'Duncan!'" murmured Ayrton. "Already?" This last word<br/>escaped Ayrton's lips as if involuntarily, and his head drooped<br/>upon his hands.<br/><br/>Did not twelve years' solitude on a desert island appear to him<br/>a sufficient expiation? Did not the penitent yet feel himself<br/>pardoned, either in his own eyes or in the eyes of others?<br/><br/>"No," said he, "no! it cannot be the 'Duncan'!"<br/><br/>"Look, Ayrton," then said the engineer, "for it is necessary<br/>that we should know beforehand what to expect."<br/><br/>Ayrton took the glass and pointed it in the direction indicated.<br/>During some minutes he examined the horizon without moving, without<br/>uttering a word. Then,â€”<br/><br/>"It is indeed a vessel," said he, "but I do not think she is the<br/>'Duncan.'"<br/><br/>"Why do you not think so?" asked Gideon Spilett.<br/><br/>"Because the 'Duncan' is a steam-yacht, and I cannot perceive<br/>any trace of smoke either above or near that vessel."<br/><br/>"Perhaps she is simply sailing," observed Pencroft. "The wind is<br/>favorable for the direction which she appears to be taking, and she<br/>may be anxious to economize her coal, being so far from land."<br/><br/>"It is possible that you may be right, Mr. Pencroft," answered<br/>Ayrton, "and that the vessel has extinguished her fires. We must<br/>wait until she is nearer, and then we shall soon know what to<br/>expect."<br/><br/>
