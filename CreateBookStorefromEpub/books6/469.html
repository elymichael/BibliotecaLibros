<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>14<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>Three years had passed away since the escape of the prisoners<br/>from Richmond, and how often during those three years had they<br/>spoken of their country, always present in their thoughts!<br/><br/>They had no doubt that the civil war was at an end, and to them<br/>it appeared impossible that the just cause of the North had not<br/>triumphed. But what had been the incidents of this terrible war?<br/>How much blood had it not cost? How many of their friends must have<br/>fallen in the struggle? They often spoke of these things, without<br/>as yet being able to foresee the day when they would be permitted<br/>once more to see their country. To return thither, were it but for<br/>a few days, to renew the social link with the inhabited world, to<br/>establish a communication between their native land and their<br/>island, then to pass the longest, perhaps the best, portion of<br/>their existence in this colony, founded by them, and which would<br/>then be dependent on their country, was this a dream impossible to<br/>realize?<br/><br/>There were only two ways of accomplishing it—either a ship must<br/>appear off Lincoln Island, or the colonists must themselves build a<br/>vessel strong enough to sail to the nearest land.<br/><br/>"Unless," said Pencroft, "our good genius, himself provides us<br/>with the means of returning to our country."<br/><br/>And, really, had any one told Pencroft and Neb that a ship of<br/>300 tons was waiting for them in Shark Gulf or at Port Balloon,<br/>they would not even have made a gesture of surprise. In their state<br/>of mind nothing appeared improbable.<br/><br/>But Cyrus Harding, less confident, advised them to confine<br/>themselves to fact, and more especially so with regard to the<br/>building of a vessel—a really urgent work, since it was for the<br/>purpose of depositing, as soon as possible, at Tabor Island a<br/>document indicating Ayrton's new residence.<br/><br/>
