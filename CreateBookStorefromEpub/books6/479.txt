They walked at a good pace, a prey to the liveliest emotions.
There was no doubt but that they were now going to learn the
long-searched-for answer to the enigma, the name of that mysterious
being, so deeply concerned in their life, so generous in his
influence, so powerful in his action! Must not this stranger have
indeed mingled with their existence, have known the smallest
details, have heard all that was said in Granite House, to have
been able always to act in the very nick of time?

Every one, wrapped up in his own reflections, pressed forward.
Under the arch of trees the darkness was such that even the edge of
the road could not be seen. Not a sound in the forest. Both animals
and birds, influenced by the heaviness of the atmosphere, remained
motionless and silent. Not a breath disturbed the leaves. The
footsteps of the colonists alone resounded on the hardened
ground.

During the first quarter of an hour the silence was only
interrupted by this remark from Pencroft:—

"We ought to have brought a torch."

And by this reply from the engineer:—

"We shall find one at the corral."

Harding and his companions had left Granite House at twelve
minutes past nine. At forty-seven minutes past nine they had
traversed three out of the five miles which separated the mouth of
the Mercy from the corral.

At that moment sheets of lightning spread over the island and
illumined the dark trees. The flashes dazzled and almost blinded
them. Evidently the storm would not be long in bursting forth.

The flashes gradually became brighter and more rapid. Distant
thunder growled in the sky. The atmosphere was stifling.

The colonists proceeded as if they were urged onwards by some
irresistible force.
