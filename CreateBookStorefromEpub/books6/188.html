It is useless to add that Pencroft, Herbert, and Neb, thus<br/>armed, were at the summit of their happiness, although Cyrus<br/>Harding made them promise not to fire a shot unless it was<br/>necessary.<br/><br/>At six in the morning the canoe put off from the shore; all had<br/>embarked, including Top, and they proceeded to the mouth of the<br/>Mercy.<br/><br/>The tide had begun to come up half an hour before. For several<br/>hours, therefore, there would be a current, which it was well to<br/>profit by, for later the ebb would make it difficult to ascend the<br/>river. The tide was already strong, for in three days the moon<br/>would be full, and it was enough to keep the boat in the center of<br/>the current, where it floated swiftly along between the high banks<br/>without its being necessary to increase its speed by the aid of the<br/>oars. In a few minutes the explorers arrived at the angle formed by<br/>the Mercy and exactly at the place where, seven months before,<br/>Pencroft had made his first raft of wood.<br/><br/>After this sudden angle the river widened and flowed under the<br/>shade of great evergreen firs.<br/><br/>The aspect of the banks was magnificent. Cyrus Harding and his<br/>companions could not but admire the lovely effects so easily<br/>produced by nature with water and trees. As they advanced the<br/>forest element diminished. On the right bank of the river grew<br/>magnificent specimens of the ulmaceae tribe, the precious elm, so<br/>valuable to builders, and which withstands well the action of<br/>water. Then there were numerous groups belonging to the same<br/>family, among others one in particular, the fruit of which produces<br/>a very useful oil. Further on, Herbert remarked the lardizabala, a<br/>twining shrub which, when bruised in water, furnishes excellent<br/>cordage; and two or three ebony trees of a beautiful black, crossed<br/>with capricious veins.<br/><br/>From time to time, in certain places where the landing was easy,<br/>the canoe was stopped, when Gideon Spilett, Herbert, and Pencroft,<br/>their guns in their hands, and preceded by Top, jumped on shore.<br/>Without expecting game, some useful plant might be met with, and<br/>the young naturalist was delighted with discovering a sort of wild<br/>spinach, belonging to the order of chenopodiaceae, and numerous<br/>specimens of cruciferae, belonging to the cabbage tribe, which it<br/>would certainly be possible to cultivate by transplanting. There<br/>were cresses, horseradish, turnips, and lastly, little branching<br/>hairy stalks, scarcely more than three feet high, which produced<br/>brownish grains.<br/><br/>Do you know what this plant is?" asked Herbert of the<br/>sailor.<br/><br/>"Tobacco!" cried Pencroft, who evidently had never seen his<br/>favorite plant except in the bowl of his pipe.<br/><br/>"No, Pencroft," replied Herbert; "this is not tobacco, it is<br/>mustard."<br/><br/>"Mustard be hanged!" returned the sailor; "but if by chance you<br/>happen to come across a tobacco-plant, my boy, pray don't scorn<br/>that!"<br/><br/>"We shall find it some day!" said Gideon Spilett.<br/>
