The sailor's sentence was cut short by a new tinkle of the<br/>bell.<br/><br/>Harding went to the apparatus, and sent this question to the<br/>corral:—<br/><br/>"What do you want?"<br/><br/>A few moments later the needle, moving on the alphabetic dial,<br/>gave this reply to the tenants of Granite House:—<br/><br/>"Come to the corral immediately."<br/><br/>"At last!" exclaimed Harding.<br/><br/>Yes! At last! The mystery was about to be unveiled. The<br/>colonists' fatigue had disappeared before the tremendous interest<br/>which was about to urge them to the corral, and all wish for rest<br/>had ceased. Without having uttered a word, in a few moments they<br/>had left Granite House, and were standing on the beach. Jup and Top<br/>alone were left behind. They could do without them.<br/><br/>The night was black. The new moon had disappeared at the same<br/>time as the sun. As Herbert had observed, great stormy clouds<br/>formed a lowering and heavy vault, preventing any star rays. A few<br/>lightning flashes, reflections from a distant storm, illuminated<br/>the horizon.<br/><br/>It was possible that a few hours later the thunder would roll<br/>over the island itself. The night was very threatening.<br/><br/>But however deep the darkness was, it would not prevent them<br/>from finding the familiar road to the corral.<br/><br/>They ascended the left bank of the Mercy, reached the plateau,<br/>passed the bridge over Creek Glycerine, and advanced through the<br/>forest.<br/>
