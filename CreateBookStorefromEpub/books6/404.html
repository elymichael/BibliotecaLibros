The colonists worked with a will, and the two dams which besides<br/>did not exceed eight feet in width by three in height, were rapidly<br/>erected by means of well-cemented blocks of stone.<br/><br/>This work finished, it would have been impossible to guess that<br/>at that part of the lake, there existed a subterranean passage<br/>through which the overflow of the lake formerly escaped.<br/><br/>Of course the little stream which fed the reservoir of Granite<br/>House and worked the lift, had been carefully preserved, and the<br/>water could not fail. The lift once raised, this sure and<br/>comfortable retreat would be safe from any surprise.<br/><br/>This work had been so quickly done, that Pencroft, Gideon<br/>Spilett, and Herbert found time to make an expedition to Port<br/>Balloon, The sailor was very anxious to know if the little creek in<br/>which the "Bonadventure" was moored, had been visited by the<br/>convicts.<br/><br/>"These gentlemen," he observed, "landed on the south coast, and<br/>if they followed the shore, it is to be feared that they may have<br/>discovered the little harbor, and in that case, I wouldn't give<br/>half-a-dollar for our 'Bonadventure.'"<br/><br/>Pencroft's apprehensions were not without foundation, and a<br/>visit to Port Balloon appeared to be very desirable. The sailor and<br/>his companions set off on the 10th of November, after dinner, well<br/>armed. Pencroft, ostentatiously slipping two bullets into each<br/>barrel of his rifle, shook his head in a way which betokened<br/>nothing good to any one who approached too near him, whether "man<br/>or beast," as he said. Gideon Spilett and Herbert also took their<br/>guns, and about three o'clock all three left Granite House.<br/><br/>Neb accompanied them to the turn of the Mercy, and after they<br/>had crossed, he raised the bridge. It was agreed that a gunshot<br/>should announce the colonists' return, and that at the signal Neb<br/>should return and reestablish the communication between the two<br/>banks of the river.<br/><br/>The little band advanced directly along the road which led to<br/>the southern coast of the island. This was only a distance of three<br/>miles and a half, but Gideon Spilett and his companions took two<br/>hours to traverse it. They examined all the border of the road, the<br/>thick forest, as well as Tabor Marsh. They found no trace of the<br/>fugitives who, no doubt, not having yet discovered the number of<br/>the colonists, or the means of defense which they had at their<br/>disposal, had gained the less accessible parts of the island.<br/><br/>Arrived at Port Balloon, Pencroft saw with extreme satisfaction<br/>that the "Bonadventure" was tranquilly floating in the narrow<br/>creek. However, Port Balloon was so well hidden among high rocks,<br/>that it could scarcely be discovered either from the land or the<br/>sea.<br/><br/>"Come," said Pencroft, "the blackguards have not been there yet.<br/>Long grass suits reptiles best, and evidently we shall find them in<br/>the Far West."<br/><br/>"And it's very lucky, for if they had found the 'Bonadventure',"<br/>added Herbert, "they would have gone off in her, and we should have<br/>been prevented from returning to Tabor Island."<br/>
