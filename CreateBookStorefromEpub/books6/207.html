<br/>They then halted for breakfast.<br/><br/>Here began the irregular coast, covered with lines of rocks and<br/>sandbanks. The long sea-swell could be seen breaking over the rocks<br/>in the bay, forming a foamy fringe. From this point to Claw Cape<br/>the beach was very narrow between the edge of the forest and the<br/>reefs.<br/><br/>Walking was now more difficult, on account of the numerous rocks<br/>which encumbered the beach. The granite cliff also gradually<br/>increased in height, and only the green tops of the trees which<br/>crowned it could be seen.<br/><br/>After half an hour's rest, the settlers resumed their journey,<br/>and not a spot among the rocks was left unexamined. Pencroft and<br/>Neb even rushed into the surf whenever any object attracted their<br/>attention. But they found nothing, some curious formations of the<br/>rocks having deceived them. They ascertained, however, that eatable<br/>shellfish abounded there, but these could not be of any great<br/>advantage to them until some easy means of communication had been<br/>established between the two banks of the Mercy, and until the means<br/>of transport had been perfected.<br/><br/>Nothing therefore which threw any light on the supposed wreck<br/>could be found on this shore, yet an object of any importance, such<br/>as the hull of a ship, would have been seen directly, or any of her<br/>masts and spans would have been washed on shore, just as the chest<br/>had been, which was found twenty miles from here. But there was<br/>nothing.<br/><br/>Towards three o'clock Harding and his companions arrived at a<br/>snug little creek. It formed quite a natural harbor, invisible from<br/>the sea, and was entered by a narrow channel.<br/><br/>At the back of this creek some violent convulsion had torn up<br/>the rocky border, and a cutting, by a gentle slope, gave access to<br/>an upper plateau, which might be situated at least ten miles from<br/>Claw Cape, and consequently four miles in a straight line from<br/>Prospect Heights. Gideon Spilett proposed to his companions that<br/>they should make a halt here. They agreed readily, for their walk<br/>had sharpened their appetites; and although it was not their usual<br/>dinner-hour, no one refused to strengthen himself with a piece of<br/>venison. This luncheon would sustain them until their supper, which<br/>they intended to take at Granite House. In a few minutes the<br/>settlers, seated under a clump of fine sea-pines, were devouring<br/>the provisions which Neb produced from his bag.<br/><br/>This spot was raised from fifty to sixty feet above the level of<br/>the sea. The view was very extensive, but beyond the cape it ended<br/>in Union Bay. Neither the islet nor Prospect Heights was visible,<br/>and could not be from thence, for the rising ground and the curtain<br/>of trees closed the northern horizon.<br/><br/>It is useless to add that notwithstanding the wide extent of sea<br/>which the explorers could survey, and though the engineer swept the<br/>horizon with his glass, no vessel could be found.<br/><br/>The shore was of course examined with the same care from the<br/>edge of the water to the cliff, and nothing could be discovered<br/>even with the aid of the instrument.<br/><br/>
