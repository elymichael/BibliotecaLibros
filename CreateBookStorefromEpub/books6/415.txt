"Do not make us lose it, my friend."

Pencroft was silent, but a reaction set in, and great tears
rolled down his cheeks.

In the meanwhile, Gideon Spilett endeavored to collect his
ideas, and proceed methodically. After his examination he had no
doubt that the ball, entering in front, between the seventh and
eighth ribs, had issued behind between the third and fourth. But
what mischief had the ball committed in its passage? What important
organs had been reached? A professional surgeon would have had
difficulty in determining this at once, and still more so the
reporter.

However, he knew one thing, this was that he would have to
prevent the inflammatory strangulation of the injured parts, then
to contend with the local inflammation and fever which would result
from the wound, perhaps mortal! Now, what styptics, what
antiphiogistics ought to be employed? By what means could
inflammation be prevented?

At any rate, the most important thing was that the two wounds
should be dressed without delay. It did not appear necessary to
Gideon Spilett that a fresh flow of blood should be caused by
bathing them in tepid water, and compressing their lips. The
hemorrhage had been very abundant, and Herbert was already too much
enfeebled by the loss of blood.

The reporter, therefore, thought it best to simply bathe the two
wounds with cold water.

Herbert was placed on his left side, and was maintained in that
position.

"He must not be moved." said Gideon Spilett. "He is in the most
favorable position for the wounds in his back and chest to
suppurate easily, and absolute rest is necessary."

"What! can't we carry him to Granite House?" asked Pencroft.

"No, Pencroft," replied the reporter.

"I'll pay the villains off!" cried the sailor, shaking his fist
in a menacing manner.
