<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>2<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>There was no longer any doubt as to the pirates' intentions.<br/>They had dropped anchor at a short distance from the island, and it<br/>was evident that the next day by means of their boats they purposed<br/>to land on the beach!<br/><br/>Cyrus Harding and his companions were ready to act, but,<br/>determined though they were, they must not forget to be prudent.<br/>Perhaps their presence might still be concealed in the event of the<br/>pirates contenting themselves with landing on the shore without<br/>examining the interior of the island. It might be, indeed, that<br/>their only intention was to obtain fresh water from the Mercy, and<br/>it was not impossible that the bridge, thrown across a mile and a<br/>half from the mouth, and the manufactory at the Chimneys might<br/>escape their notice.<br/><br/>But why was that flag hoisted at the brig's peak? What was that<br/>shot fired for? Pure bravado doubtless, unless it was a sign of the<br/>act of taking possession. Harding knew now that the vessel was well<br/>armed. And what had the colonists of Lincoln Island to reply to the<br/>pirates' guns? A few muskets only.<br/><br/>"However," observed Cyrus Harding, "here we are in an<br/>impregnable position. The enemy cannot discover the mouth of the<br/>outlet, now that it is hidden under reeds and grass, and<br/>consequently it would be impossible for them to penetrate into<br/>Granite House."<br/><br/>"But our plantations, our poultry-yard, our corral, all,<br/>everything!" exclaimed Pencroft, stamping his foot. "They may spoil<br/>everything, destroy everything in a few hours!"<br/><br/>"Everything, Pencroft," answered Harding, "and we have no means<br/>of preventing them."<br/><br/>
