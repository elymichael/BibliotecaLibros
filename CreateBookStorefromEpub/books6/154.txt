While eating they looked around them. This part of Lincoln
Island was very sterile, and contrasted with all the western part.
The reporter was thus led to observe that if chance had thrown them
at first on the shore, they would have had but a deplorable idea of
their future domain.

"I believe that we should not have been able to reach it,"
replied the engineer, "for the sea is deep, and there is not a rock
on which we could have taken refuge. Before Granite House, at
least, there were sandbanks, an islet, which multiplied our chances
of safety. Here, nothing but the depths!"

"It is singular enough," remarked Spilett, "that this
comparatively small island should present such varied ground. This
diversity of aspect, logically only belongs to continents of a
certain extent. One would really say, that the western part of
Lincoln Island, so rich and so fertile, is washed by the warm
waters of the Gulf of Mexico, and that its shores to the north and
the southeast extend over a sort of Arctic sea."

"You are right, my dear Spilett," replied Cyrus Harding, "I have
also observed this. I think the form and also the nature of this
island strange. It is a summary of all the aspects which a
continent presents, and I should not be surprised if it was a
continent formerly."

"What! a continent in the middle of the Pacific?" cried
Pencroft.

"Why not?" replied Cyrus Harding. "Why should not Australia, New
Ireland, Australasia, united to the archipelagoes of the Pacific,
have once formed a sixth part of the world, as important as Europe
or Asia, as Africa or the two Americas? To my mind, it is quite
possible that all these islands, emerging from this vast ocean, are
but the summits of a continent, now submerged, but which was above
the waters at a prehistoric period."

"As the Atlantis was formerly," replied Herbert.

"Yes, my boyâ€¦ if, however, it existed."

"And would Lincoln Island have been a part of that continent?"
asked Pencroft.

"It is probable," replied Cyrus Harding, "and that would
sufficiently, explain the variety of productions which are seen on
its surface."
