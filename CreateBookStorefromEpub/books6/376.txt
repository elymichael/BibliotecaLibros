Gideon Spilett and Neb crouched among the rocks at the mouth of
the Mercy, from which the drawbridges had been raised, so as to
prevent any one from crossing in a boat or landing on the opposite
shore.

As to Ayrton and Pencroft, they shoved off in the boat, and
prepared to cross the channel and to take up two separate stations
on the islet. In this way, shots being fired from four different
points at once, the convicts would be led to believe that the
island was both largely peopled and strongly defended.

In the event of a landing being effected without their having
been able to prevent it, and also if they saw that they were on the
point of being cut off by the brig's boat, Ayrton and Pencroft were
to return in their boat to the shore and proceed towards the
threatened spot.

Before starting to occupy their posts, the colonists for the
last time wrung each other's hands.

Pencroft succeeded in controlling himself sufficiently to
suppress his emotion when he embraced Herbert, his boy! and then
they separated.

In a few moments Harding and Herbert on one side, the reporter
and Neb on the other, had disappeared behind the rocks, and five
minutes later Ayrton and Pencroft, having without difficulty
crossed the channel, disembarked on the islet and concealed
themselves in the clefts of its eastern shore.

None of them could have been seen, for they themselves could
scarcely distinguish the brig in the fog.

It was half-past six in the morning.

Soon the fog began to clear away, and the topmasts of the brig
issued from the vapor. For some minutes great masses rolled over
the surface of the sea, then a breeze sprang up, which rapidly
dispelled the mist.

The "Speedy" now appeared in full view, with a spring on her
cable, her head to the north, presenting her larboard side to the
island. Just as Harding had calculated, she was not more than a
mile and a quarter from the coast.

The sinister black flag floated from the peak.
