There a site was chosen, at the back of the southern ridge of<br/>the mountain. It was a meadow land, dotted here and there with<br/>clumps of trees, and watered by a little stream, which sprung from<br/>the slopes which closed it in on one side. The grass was fresh, and<br/>it was not too much shaded by the trees which grew about it. This<br/>meadow was to be surrounded by a palisade, high enough to prevent<br/>even the most agile animals from leaping over. This enclosure would<br/>be large enough to contain a hundred musmons and wild goats, with<br/>all the young ones they might produce.<br/><br/>The perimeter of the corral was then traced by the engineer, and<br/>they would then have proceeded to fell the trees necessary for the<br/>construction of the palisade, but as the opening up of the road had<br/>already necessitated the sacrifice of a considerable number, those<br/>were brought and supplied a hundred stakes, which were firmly fixed<br/>in the ground.<br/><br/>The construction of this corral did not take less than three<br/>weeks, for besides the palisade, Cyrus Harding built large sheds,<br/>in which the animals could take shelter. These buildings had also<br/>to be made very strong, for musmons are powerful animals, and their<br/>first fury was to be feared. The stakes, sharpened at their upper<br/>end and hardened by fire, had been fixed by means of cross-bars,<br/>and at regular distances props assured the solidity of the<br/>whole.<br/><br/>The corral finished, a raid had to be made on the pastures<br/>frequented by the ruminants. This was done on the 7th of February,<br/>on a beautiful summer's day, and every one took part in it. The<br/>onagers, already well trained, were ridden by Spilett and Herbert,<br/>and were of great use.<br/><br/>The maneuver consisted simply in surrounding the musmons and<br/>goats, and gradually narrowing the circle around them. Cyrus<br/>Harding, Pencroft, Neb, and Jup, posted themselves in different<br/>parts of the wood, while the two cavaliers and Top galloped in a<br/>radius of half a mile round the corral.<br/><br/>The musmons were very numerous in this part of the island. These<br/>fine animals were as large as deer; their horns were stronger than<br/>those of the ram, and their gray-colored fleece was mixed with long<br/>hair.<br/><br/>This hunting day was very fatiguing. Such going and coming, and<br/>running and riding and shouting! Of a hundred musmons which had<br/>been surrounded, more than two-thirds escaped, but at last, thirty<br/>of these animals and ten wild goats were gradually driven back<br/>towards the corral, the open door of which appearing to offer a<br/>means of escape, they rushed in and were prisoners.<br/><br/>In short, the result was satisfactory, and the settlers had no<br/>reason to complain. There was no doubt that the flock would<br/>prosper, and that at no distant time not only wool but hides would<br/>be abundant.<br/><br/>That evening the hunters returned to Granite House quite<br/>exhausted. However, notwithstanding their fatigue, they returned<br/>the next day to visit the corral. The prisoners had been trying to<br/>overthrow the palisade, but of course had not succeeded, and were<br/>not long in becoming more tranquil.<br/><br/>During the month of February, no event of any importance<br/>occurred. The daily labors were pursued methodically, and, as well<br/>as improving the roads to the corral and to Port Balloon, a third<br/>was commenced, which, starting from the enclosure, proceeded<br/>towards the western coast. The yet unknown portion of Lincoln<br/>Island was that of the wood-covered Serpentine Peninsula, which<br/>sheltered the wild beasts, from which Gideon Spilett was so anxious<br/>to clear their domain.<br/><br/>Before the cold season should appear the most assiduous care was<br/>given to the cultivation of the wild plants which had been<br/>transplanted from the forest to Prospect Heights. Herbert never<br/>returned from an excursion without bringing home some useful<br/>vegetable. One day, it was some specimens of the chicory tribe, the<br/>seeds of which by pressure yield an excellent oil; another, it was<br/>some common sorrel, whose antiscorbutic qualities were not to be<br/>despised; then, some of those precious tubers, which have at all<br/>times been cultivated in South America, potatoes, of which more<br/>than two hundred species are now known. The kitchen garden, now<br/>well stocked and carefully defended from the birds, was divided<br/>into small beds, where grew lettuces, kidney potatoes, sorrel,<br/>turnips, radishes, and other coneiferae. The soil on the plateau<br/>was particularly fertile, and it was hoped that the harvests would<br/>be abundant.<br/>
