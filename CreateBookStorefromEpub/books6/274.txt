So saying, Herbert, leaning over the side, plunged his arm into
the water, and pulled it out, exclaiming,—

"A bottle!"

He held in his hand a corked bottle which he had just seized a
few cables' length from the shore.

Cyrus Harding took the bottle. Without uttering a single word he
drew the cork, and took from it a damp paper, on which were written
these words:—

"Castaway&#160;… . Tabor island: 153deg W. long., 37deg 11' S.
lat."
