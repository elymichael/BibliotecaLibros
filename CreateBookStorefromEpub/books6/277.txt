Thus it had been agreed that Cyrus Harding, Neb, and Gideon
Spilett should remain at Granite House, but an objection was
raised, and Spilett, who had not forgotten his business as reporter
to the New York Herald, having declared that he would go by
swimming rather than lose such an opportunity, he was admitted to
take a part in the voyage.

The evening was occupied in transporting on board the
"Bonadventure," articles of bedding, utensils, arms, ammunition, a
compass, provisions for a week; this being rapidly done, the
colonists ascended to Granite House.

The next day, at five o'clock in the morning, the farewells were
said, not without some emotion on both sides, and Pencroft setting
sail made towards Claw Cape, which had to be doubled in order to
proceed to the southwest.

The "Bonadventure" was already a quarter of a mile from the
coast when the passengers perceived on the heights of Granite House
two men waving their farewells; they were Cyrus Harding and
Neb.

"Our friends," exclaimed Spilett, "this is our first separation
in fifteen months."

Pencroft, the reporter and Herbert waved in return, and Granite
House soon disappeared behind the high rocks of the Cape.

During the first part of the day the "Bonadventure" was still in
sight of the southern coast of Lincoln Island, which soon appeared
just like a green basket, with Mount Franklin rising from the
center. The heights, diminished by distance, did not present an
appearance likely to tempt vessels to touch there. Reptile End was
passed in about an hour, though at a distance of about ten
miles.

At this distance it was no longer possible to distinguish
anything of the Western Coast, which stretched away to the ridges
of Mount Franklin, and three hours after the last of Lincoln Island
sank below the horizon.

The "Bonadventure" behaved capitally. Bounding over the waves
she proceeded rapidly on her course. Pencroft had hoisted the
foresail, and steering by the compass followed a rectilinear
direction. From time to time Herbert relieved him at the helm, and
the lad's hand was so firm that the sailor had not a point to find
fault with.

Gideon Spilett chatted sometimes with one, sometimes with the
other, if wanted he lent a hand with the ropes, and Captain
Pencroft was perfectly satisfied with his crew.
