<br/>On the morning of the 16th of April all the colonists, including<br/>Top, embarked. A fine breeze blew from the south-west, and the<br/>"Bonadventure" tacked on leaving Port Balloon so as to reach<br/>Reptile End. Of the ninety miles which the perimeter of the island<br/>measured, twenty included the south coast between the port and the<br/>promontory. The wind being right ahead it was necessary to hug the<br/>shore.<br/><br/>It took the whole day to reach the promontory, for the vessel on<br/>leaving port had only two hours of ebb tide and had therefore to<br/>make way for six hours against the flood. It was nightfall before<br/>the promontory was doubled.<br/><br/>The sailor then proposed to the engineer that they should<br/>continue sailing slowly with two reefs in the sail. But Harding<br/>preferred to anchor a few cable-lengths from the shore, so as to<br/>survey that part of the coast during the day. It was agreed also<br/>that as they were anxious for a minute exploration of the coast<br/>they should not sail during the night, but would always, when the<br/>weather permitted it, be at anchor near the shore.<br/><br/>The night was passed under the promontory, and the wind having<br/>fallen, nothing disturbed the silence. The passengers, with the<br/>exception of the sailor, scarcely slept as well on board the<br/>"Bonadventure" as they would have done in their rooms at Granite<br/>House, but they did sleep however. Pencroft set sail at break of<br/>day, and by going on the larboard tack they could keep close to the<br/>shore.<br/><br/>The colonists knew this beautiful wooded coast, since they had<br/>already explored it on foot, and yet it again excited their<br/>admiration. They coasted along as close in as possible, so as to<br/>notice everything, avoiding always the trunks of trees which<br/>floated here and there. Several times also they anchored, and<br/>Gideon Spilett took photographs of the superb scenery.<br/><br/>About noon the "Bonadventure" arrived at the mouth of Falls<br/>River. Beyond, on the left bank, a few scattered trees appeared,<br/>and three miles further even these dwindled into solitary groups<br/>among the western spurs of the mountain, whose arid ridge sloped<br/>down to the shore.<br/><br/>What a contrast between the northern and southern part of the<br/>coast! In proportion as one was woody and fertile so was the other<br/>rugged and barren! It might have been designated as one of those<br/>iron coasts, as they are called in some countries, and its wild<br/>confusion appeared to indicate that a sudden crystallization had<br/>been produced in the yet liquid basalt of some distant geological<br/>sea. These stupendous masses would have terrified the settlers if<br/>they had been cast at first on this part of the island! They had<br/>not been able to perceive the sinister aspect of this shore from<br/>the summit of Mount Franklin, for they overlooked it from too great<br/>a height, but viewed from the sea it presented a wild appearance<br/>which could not perhaps be equaled in any corner of the globe.<br/><br/>The "Bonadventure" sailed along this coast for the distance of<br/>half a mile. It was easy to see that it was composed of blocks of<br/>all sizes, from twenty to three hundred feet in height, and of all<br/>shapes, round like towers, prismatic like steeples, pyramidal like<br/>obelisks, conical like factory chimneys. An iceberg of the Polar<br/>seas could not have been more capricious in its terrible sublimity!<br/>Here, bridges were thrown from one rock to another; there, arches<br/>like those of a wave, into the depths of which the eye could not<br/>penetrate; in one place, large vaulted excavations presented a<br/>monumental aspect; in another, a crowd of columns, spires, and<br/>arches, such as no Gothic cathedral ever possessed. Every caprice<br/>of nature, still more varied than those of the imagination,<br/>appeared on this grand coast, which extended over a length of eight<br/>or nine miles.<br/><br/>Cyrus Harding and his companions gazed, with a feeling of<br/>surprise bordering on stupefaction. But, although they remained<br/>silent, Top, not being troubled with feelings of this sort, uttered<br/>barks which were repeated by the thousand echoes of the basaltic<br/>cliff. The engineer even observed that these barks had something<br/>strange in them, like those which the dog had uttered at the mouth<br/>of the well in Granite House.<br/><br/>"Let us go close in," said he.<br/><br/>
