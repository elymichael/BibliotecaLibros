"A very fine wind," replied the sailor; "but we must tack to
enter the gulf, and I should like to see my way clear in these
unknown quarters."

"Quarters which appear to be filled with rocks," added Herbert,
"if we judge by what we saw on the south coast of Shark Gulf."

"Pencroft," said Cyrus Harding, "do as you think best, we will
leave it to you."

"Don't make your mind uneasy, captain," replied the sailor, "I
shall not expose myself needlessly! I would rather a knife were run
into my ribs than a sharp rock into those of my
'Bonadventure!'"

That which Pencroft called ribs was the pan of his vessel under
water, and he valued it more than his own skin.

"What o'clock is it?" asked Pencroft.

"Ten o'clock," replied Gideon Spilett.

"And what distance is it to the Cape, captain?"

"About fifteen miles," replied the engineer.

"That's a matter of two hours and a half," said the sailor, "and
we shall be off the Cape between twelve and one o'clock. Unluckily,
the tide will be turning at that moment, and will be ebbing out of
the gulf. I am afraid that it will be very difficult to get in,
having both wind and tide against us."
