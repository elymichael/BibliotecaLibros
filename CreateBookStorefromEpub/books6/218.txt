The settlers asked if Granite House was inhabited or not, and
yet the position of the ladder was sufficient to show that it was;
it was also certain that the inhabitants, whoever they might be,
had not been able to escape. But how were they to be got at?

Herbert then thought of fastening a cord to an arrow, and
shooting the arrow so that it should pass between the first rounds
of the ladder which hung from the threshold. By means of the cord
they would then be able to draw down the ladder to the ground, and
so re-establish the communication between the beach and Granite
House. There was evidently nothing else to be done, and, with a
little skill, this method might succeed. Very fortunately bows and
arrows had been left at the Chimneys, where they also found a
quantity of light hibiscus cord. Pencroft fastened this to a
well-feathered arrow. Then Herbert fixing it to his bow, took a
careful aim for the lower part of the ladder.

Cyrus Harding, Gideon Spilett, Pencroft, and Neb drew back, so
as to see if anything appeared at the windows. The reporter lifted
his gun to his shoulder and covered the door.

The bow was bent, the arrow flew, taking the cord with it, and
passed between the two last rounds.

The operation had succeeded.

Herbert immediately seized the end of the cord, but, at that
moment when he gave it a pull to bring down the ladder, an arm,
thrust suddenly out between the wall and the door, grasped it and
dragged it inside Granite House.

"The rascals!" shouted the sailor. "If a ball can do anything
for you, you shall not have long to wait for it.

"But who was it?" asked Neb.

"Who was it? Didn't you see?"

"No."

"It was a monkey, a sapajou, an orangoutang, a baboon, a
gorilla, a sagoin. Our dwelling has been invaded by monkeys, who
climbed up the ladder during our absence."
