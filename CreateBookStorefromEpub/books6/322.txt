"'A Scotchman like yourself, my lord,' replied the man; 'I am
one of Captain Grant's crew—one of the castaways of the
"Britannia."'

"This man was called Ayrton. He was, in fact, the boatswain's
mate of the 'Britannia,' as his papers showed. But, separated from
Captain Grant at the moment when the ship struck upon the rocks, he
had till then believed that the captain with all his crew had
perished, and that he, Ayrton, was the sole survivor of the
'Britannia.'

"'Only,' he added, 'it was not on the west coast, but on the
east coast of Australia that the vessel was lost, and if Captain
Grant is still living, as his document indicates, he is a prisoner
among the natives, and it is on the other coast that he must be
looked for.'

"This man spoke in a frank voice and with a confident look; his
words could not be doubted. The irishman, in whose service he had
been for more than a year, answered for his trustworthiness. Lord
Glenarvan, therefore, believed in the fidelity of this man and, by
his advice, resolved to cross Australia, following the
thirty-seventh parallel. Lord Glenarvan, his wife, the two
children, the major, the Frenchman, Captain Mangles, and a few
sailors composed the little band under the command of Ayrton, while
the 'Duncan,' under charge of the mate, Tom Austin, proceeded to
Melbourne, there to await Lord Glenarvan's instructions.

"They set out on the 23rd of December, 1854.

"It is time to say that Ayrton was a traitor. He was, indeed,
the boatswain's mate of the 'Britannia,' but, after some dispute
with his captain, he endeavored to incite the crew to mutiny and
seize the ship, and Captain Grant had landed him, on the 8th of
April, 1852, on the west coast of Australia, and then sailed,
leaving him there, as was only just.

"Therefore this wretched man knew nothing of the wreck of the
'Britannia'; he had just heard of it from Glenarvan's account.
Since his abandonment, he had become, under the name of Ben Joyce,
the leader of the escaped convicts; and if he boldly maintained
that the wreck had taken place on the east coast, and led Lord
Glenarvan to proceed in that direction, it was that he hoped to
separate him from his ship, seize the 'Duncan,' and make the yacht
a pirate in the Pacific."

Here the stranger stopped for a moment. His voice trembled, but
he continued,—

"The expedition set out and proceeded across Australia. It was
inevitably unfortunate, since Ayrton, or Ben Joyce, as he may be
called, guided it, sometimes preceded, sometimes followed by his
band of convicts, who had been told what they had to do.

"Meanwhile, the 'Duncan' had been sent to Melbourne for repairs.
It was necessary, then, to get Lord Glenarvan to order her to leave
Melbourne and go to the east coast of Australia, where it would be
easy to seize her. After having led the expedition near enough to
the coast, in the midst of vast forests with no resources, Ayrton
obtained a letter, which he was charged to carry to the mate of the
'Duncan'—a letter which ordered the yacht to repair immediately to
the east coast, to Twofold Bay, that is to say a few days' journey
from the place where the expedition had stopped. It was there that
Ayrton had agreed to meet his accomplices, and two days after
gaining possession of the letter, he arrived at Melbourne.

"So far the villain had succeeded in his wicked design. He would
be able to take the 'Duncan' into Twofold Bay, where it would be
easy for the convicts to seize her, and her crew massacred, Ben
Joyce would become master of the seas. But it pleased God to
prevent the accomplishment of these terrible projects.
