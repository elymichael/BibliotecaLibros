"After all, what matters now?" he murmured; "I am dying!"

Cyrus Harding drew near the captain, and Gideon Spilett took his
hand—it was of a feverish heat. Ayrton, Pencroft, Herbert, and Neb
stood respectfully apart in an angle of the magnificent saloon,
whose atmosphere was saturated with the electric fluid.

Meanwhile Captain Nemo withdrew his hand, and motioned the
engineer and the reporter to be seated.

All regarded him with profound emotion. Before them they beheld
that being whom they had styled the "genius of the island," the
powerful protector whose intervention, in so many circumstances,
had been so efficacious, the benefactor to whom they owed such a
debt of gratitude! Their eyes beheld a man only, and a man at the
point of death, where Pencroft and Neb had expected to find an
almost supernatural being!

But how happened it that Cyrus Harding had recognized Captain
Nemo? why had the latter so suddenly risen on hearing this name
uttered, a name which he had believed known to none?—

The captain had resumed his position on the divan, and leaning
on his arm, he regarded the engineer, seated near him.

"You know the name I formerly bore, sir?" he asked.

"I do," answered Cyrus Harding, "and also that of this wonderful
submarine vessel—"

"The 'Nautilus'?" said the captain, with a faint smile.

"The 'Nautilus.'"

"But do you—do you know who I am?"
