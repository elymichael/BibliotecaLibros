The next day, the 8th of December, was but a succession of the
fainting fits. Herbert's thin hands clutched the sheets. They had
administered further doses of pounded bark, but the reporter
expected no result from it.

"If before tomorrow morning we have not given him a more
energetic febrifuge," said the reporter, "Herbert will be
dead."

Night arrivedâ€”the last night, it was too much to be feared, of
the good, brave, intelligent boy, so far in advance of his years,
and who was loved by all as their own child. The only remedy which
existed against this terrible malignant fever, the only specific
which could overcome it, was not to be found in Lincoln Island.

During the night of the 8th of December, Herbert was seized by a
more violent delirium. His liver was fearfully congested, his brain
affected, and already it was impossible for him to recognize any
one.

Would he live until the next day, until that third attack which
must infallibly carry him off? It was not probable. His strength
was exhausted, and in the intervals of fever he lay as one
dead.

Towards three o'clock in the morning Herbert uttered a piercing
cry. He seemed to be torn by a supreme convulsion. Neb, who was
near him, terrified, ran into the next room where his companions
were watching.

Top, at that moment, barked in a strange manner.

All rushed in immediately and managed to restrain the dying boy,
who was endeavoring to throw himself out of his bed, while Spilett,
taking his arm, felt his pulse gradually quicken.

It was five in the morning. The rays of the rising sun began to
shine in at the windows of Granite House. It promised to be a fine
day, and this day was to be poor Herbert's last!

A ray glanced on the table placed near the bed.

Suddenly Pencroft, uttering a cry, pointed to the table.
