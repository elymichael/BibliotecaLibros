"Ah, if we only had a knife!" cried the sailor.

"Well?" asked Cyrus Harding.

"Well! I would soon make a bow and arrows, and then there could
be plenty of game in the larder!"

"Yes, a knife, a sharp blade." said the engineer, as if he was
speaking to himself.

At this moment his eyes fell upon Top, who was running about on
the shore. Suddenly Harding's face became animated.

"Top, here," said he.

The dog came at his master's call. The latter took Top's head
between his hands, and unfastening the collar which the animal wore
round his neck, he broke it in two, saying,â€”

"There are two knives, Pencroft!"

Two hurrahs from the sailor was the reply. Top's collar was made
of a thin piece of tempered steel. They had only to sharpen it on a
piece of sandstone, then to raise the edge on a finer stone. Now
sandstone was abundant on the beach, and two hours after the stock
of tools in the colony consisted of two sharp blades, which were
easily fixed in solid handles.

The production of these their first tools was hailed as a
triumph. It was indeed a valuable result of their labor, and a very
opportune one. They set out.
