"No one," replied Pencroft.<br/><br/>"It is a long time since this room has been inhabited," observed<br/>Herbert.<br/><br/>"Yes, a very long time!" answered the reporter.<br/><br/>"Mr. Spilett," then said Pencroft, "instead of returning on<br/>board, I think that it would be well to pass the night in this<br/>hut."<br/><br/>"You are right, Pencroft," answered Gideon Spilett, "and if its<br/>owner returns, well! perhaps he will not be sorry to find the place<br/>taken possession of."<br/><br/>"He will not return," said the sailor, shaking his head.<br/><br/>"You think that he has quitted the island?" asked the<br/>reporter.<br/><br/>"If he had quitted the island he would have taken away his<br/>weapons and his tools," replied Pencroft. "You know the value which<br/>castaways set on such articles as these the last remains of a<br/>wreck. No! no!" repeated the sailor, in a tone of conviction; "no,<br/>he has not left the island! If he had escaped in a boat made by<br/>himself, he would still less have left these indispensable and<br/>necessary articles. No! he is on the island!"<br/><br/>"Living?" asked Herbert.<br/><br/>"Living or dead. But if he is dead, I suppose he has not buried<br/>himself, and so we shall at least find his remains!"<br/><br/>It was then agreed that the night should be passed in the<br/>deserted dwelling, and a store of wood found in a corner was<br/>sufficient to warm it. The door closed, Pencroft, Herbert and<br/>Spilett remained there, seated on a bench, talking little but<br/>wondering much. They were in a frame of mind to imagine anything or<br/>expect anything. They listened eagerly for sounds outside. The door<br/>might have opened suddenly, and a man presented himself to them<br/>without their being in the least surprised, notwithstanding all<br/>that the hut revealed of abandonment, and they had their hands<br/>ready to press the hands of this man, this castaway, this unknown<br/>friend, for whom friends were waiting.<br/>
