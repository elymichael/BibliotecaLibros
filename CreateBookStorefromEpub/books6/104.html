<br/>The second distance between the stick and the bottom of the<br/>cliff was five hundred feet.<br/><br/>These measurements finished, Cyrus Harding and the lad returned<br/>to the Chimneys.<br/><br/>The engineer then took a flat stone which he had brought back<br/>from one of his previous excursions, a sort of slate, on which it<br/>was easy to trace figures with a sharp shell. He then proved the<br/>following proportions:—<br/><br/>15:500::10:x<br/><br/>500 x 10 = 5000<br/><br/>5000 / 15 = 333.3<br/><br/>From which it was proved that the granite cliff measured 333<br/>feet in height.<br/><br/>Cyrus Harding then took the instrument which he had made the<br/>evening before, the space between its two legs giving the angular<br/>distance between the star Alpha and the horizon. He measured, very<br/>exactly, the opening of this angle on a circumference which he<br/>divided into 360 equal parts. Now, this angle by adding to it the<br/>twenty-seven degrees which separated Alpha from the antarctic pole,<br/>and by reducing to the level of the sea the height of the cliff on<br/>which the observation had been made, was found to be fifty- three<br/>degrees. These fifty-three degrees being subtracted from ninety<br/>degrees—the distance from the pole to the equator—there remained<br/>thirty- seven degrees. Cyrus Harding concluded, therefore, that<br/>Lincoln Island was situated on the thirty-seventh degree of the<br/>southern latitude, or taking into consideration through the<br/>imperfection of the performance, an error of five degrees, that it<br/>must be situated between the thirty-fifth and the fortieth<br/>parallel.<br/><br/>There was only the longitude to be obtained, and the position of<br/>the island would be determined, The engineer hoped to attempt this<br/>the same day, at twelve o'clock, at which moment the sun would pass<br/>the meridian.<br/><br/>It was decided that Sunday should be spent in a walk, or rather<br/>an exploring expedition, to that side of the island between the<br/>north of the lake and Shark Gulf, and if there was time they would<br/>push their discoveries to the northern side of Cape South Mandible.<br/>They would breakfast on the downs, and not return till evening.<br/><br/>
