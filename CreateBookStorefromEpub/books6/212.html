They certainly could not think of carrying this load of cloth,<br/>ropes, and cordage, to Granite House, for the weight of it was very<br/>considerable, and while waiting for a suitable vehicle in which to<br/>convey it, it was of importance that this treasure should not be<br/>left longer exposed to the mercies of the first storm. The<br/>settlers, uniting their efforts, managed to drag it as far as the<br/>shore, where they discovered a large rocky cavity, which owing to<br/>its position could not be visited either by the wind or rain.<br/><br/>"We needed a locker, and now we have one," said Pencroft; "but<br/>as we cannot lock it up, it will be prudent to hide the opening. I<br/>don't mean from two-legged thieves, but from those with four<br/>paws!"<br/><br/>At six o'clock, all was stowed away, and after having given the<br/>creek the very suitable name of "Port Balloon," the settlers<br/>pursued their way along Claw Cape. Pencroft and the engineer talked<br/>of the different projects which it was agreed to put into execution<br/>with the briefest possible delay. It was necessary first of all to<br/>throw a bridge over the Mercy, so as to establish an easy<br/>communication with the south of the island; then the cart must be<br/>taken to bring back the balloon, for the canoe alone could not<br/>carry it, then they would build a decked boat, and Pencroft would<br/>rig it as a cutter, and they would be able to undertake voyages of<br/>circumnavigation round the island, etc.<br/><br/>In the meanwhile night came on, and it was already dark when the<br/>settlers reached Flotsam Point, where they had found the precious<br/>chest.<br/><br/>The distance between Flotsam Point and Granite House was another<br/>four miles, and it was midnight when, after having followed the<br/>shore to the mouth of the Mercy, the settlers arrived at the first<br/>angle formed by the Mercy.<br/><br/>There the river was eighty feet in breadth, which was awkward to<br/>cross, but as Pencroft had taken upon himself to conquer this<br/>difficulty, he was compelled to do it. The settlers certainly had<br/>reason to be pretty tired. The journey had been long, and the task<br/>of getting down the balloon had not rested either their arms or<br/>legs. They were anxious to reach Granite House to eat and sleep,<br/>and if the bridge had been constructed, in a quarter of an hour<br/>they would have been at home.<br/><br/>The night was very dark. Pencroft prepared to keep his promise<br/>by constructing a sort of raft, on which to make the passage of the<br/>Mercy. He and Neb, armed with axes, chose two trees near the water,<br/>and began to attack them at the base.<br/><br/>Cyrus Harding and Spilett, seated on the bank, waited till their<br/>companions were ready for their help, while Herbert roamed about,<br/>though without going to any distance. All at once, the lad, who had<br/>strolled by the river, came running back, and, pointing up the<br/>Mercy, exclaimed,—<br/><br/>"What is floating there?"<br/><br/>Pencroft stopped working, and seeing an indistinct object moving<br/>through the gloom,—<br/><br/>"A canoe!" cried he.<br/>
