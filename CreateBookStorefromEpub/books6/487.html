It can only be he!" he cried, "he!—"<br/><br/>Then, falling back on the seat, he murmured a name which Gideon<br/>Spilett alone could hear.<br/><br/>The reporter evidently knew this name, for it had a wonderful<br/>effect upon him, and he answered in a hoarse voice,—<br/><br/>"He! an outlawed man!"<br/><br/>"He!" said Harding.<br/><br/>At the engineer's command the boat approached this singular<br/>floating apparatus.
