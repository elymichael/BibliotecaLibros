They then halted for breakfast.

Here began the irregular coast, covered with lines of rocks and
sandbanks. The long sea-swell could be seen breaking over the rocks
in the bay, forming a foamy fringe. From this point to Claw Cape
the beach was very narrow between the edge of the forest and the
reefs.

Walking was now more difficult, on account of the numerous rocks
which encumbered the beach. The granite cliff also gradually
increased in height, and only the green tops of the trees which
crowned it could be seen.

After half an hour's rest, the settlers resumed their journey,
and not a spot among the rocks was left unexamined. Pencroft and
Neb even rushed into the surf whenever any object attracted their
attention. But they found nothing, some curious formations of the
rocks having deceived them. They ascertained, however, that eatable
shellfish abounded there, but these could not be of any great
advantage to them until some easy means of communication had been
established between the two banks of the Mercy, and until the means
of transport had been perfected.

Nothing therefore which threw any light on the supposed wreck
could be found on this shore, yet an object of any importance, such
as the hull of a ship, would have been seen directly, or any of her
masts and spans would have been washed on shore, just as the chest
had been, which was found twenty miles from here. But there was
nothing.

Towards three o'clock Harding and his companions arrived at a
snug little creek. It formed quite a natural harbor, invisible from
the sea, and was entered by a narrow channel.

At the back of this creek some violent convulsion had torn up
the rocky border, and a cutting, by a gentle slope, gave access to
an upper plateau, which might be situated at least ten miles from
Claw Cape, and consequently four miles in a straight line from
Prospect Heights. Gideon Spilett proposed to his companions that
they should make a halt here. They agreed readily, for their walk
had sharpened their appetites; and although it was not their usual
dinner-hour, no one refused to strengthen himself with a piece of
venison. This luncheon would sustain them until their supper, which
they intended to take at Granite House. In a few minutes the
settlers, seated under a clump of fine sea-pines, were devouring
the provisions which Neb produced from his bag.

This spot was raised from fifty to sixty feet above the level of
the sea. The view was very extensive, but beyond the cape it ended
in Union Bay. Neither the islet nor Prospect Heights was visible,
and could not be from thence, for the rising ground and the curtain
of trees closed the northern horizon.

It is useless to add that notwithstanding the wide extent of sea
which the explorers could survey, and though the engineer swept the
horizon with his glass, no vessel could be found.

The shore was of course examined with the same care from the
edge of the water to the cliff, and nothing could be discovered
even with the aid of the instrument.
