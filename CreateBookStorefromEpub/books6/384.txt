The colonists had not, perhaps, been seen, but it was certain
that Bob Harvey had thought proper to send a ball through the
suspected foliage which concealed that part of the cliff. Soon he
redoubled his attack, when another ball having torn away the leafy
screen, disclosed a gaping aperture in the granite.

The colonists' situation was desperate. Their retreat was
discovered. They could not oppose any obstacle to these missiles,
nor protect the stone, which flew in splinters around them. There
was nothing to be done but to take refuge in the upper passage of
Granite House, and leave their dwelling to be devastated, when a
deep roar was heard, followed by frightful cries!

Cyrus Harding and his companions rushed to one of the
windowsâ€”

The brig, irresistibly raised on a sort of water-spout, had just
split in two, and in less than ten seconds she was swallowed up
with all her criminal crew!
