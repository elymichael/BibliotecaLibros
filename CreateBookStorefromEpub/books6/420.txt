Spilett rapidly tore a leaf from his note-book, and wrote these
words:â€”

"Herbert wounded. We are at the corral. Be on your guard. Do not
leave Granite House. Have the convicts appeared in the
neighborhood? Reply by Top."

This laconic note contained all that Neb ought to know, and at
the same time asked all that the colonists wished to know. It was
folded and fastened to Top's collar in a conspicuous position.

"Top, my dog," said the engineer, caressing the animal, "Neb,
Top! Neb! Go, go!"

Top bounded at these words. He understood, he knew what was
expected of him. The road to the corral was familiar to him. In
less than an hour he could clear it, and it might be hoped that
where neither Cyrus Harding nor the reporter could have ventured
without danger, Top, running among the grass or in the wood, would
pass unperceived.

The engineer went to the gate of the corral and opened it.

"Neb, Top! Neb!" repeated the engineer, again pointing in the
direction of Granite House.

Top sprang forwards, then almost immediately disappeared.

"He will get there!" said the reporter.

"Yes, and he will come back, the faithful animal!"
