"The avenging power of the island," replied Harding, "he who<br/>brought you here, Ayrton, whose influence has once more manifested<br/>itself, who does for us all that which we cannot do for ourselves,<br/>and who, his will accomplished, conceals himself from us."<br/><br/>"Let us make search for him, then!" exclaimed Pencroft.<br/><br/>"Yes, we will search for him," answered Harding, "but we shall<br/>not discover this powerful being who performs such wonders, until<br/>he pleases to call us to him!"<br/><br/>This invisible protection, which rendered their own action<br/>unavailing, both irritated and piqued the engineer. The relative<br/>inferiority which it proved was of a nature to wound a haughty<br/>spirit. A generosity evinced in such a manner as to elude all<br/>tokens of gratitude, implied a sort of disdain for those on whom<br/>the obligation was conferred, which in Cyrus Harding's eyes marred,<br/>in some degree, the worth of the benefit.<br/><br/>"Let us search," he resumed, "and God grant that we may some day<br/>be permitted to prove to this haughty protector that he has not to<br/>deal with ungrateful people! What would I not give could we repay<br/>him, by rendering him in our turn, although at the price of our<br/>lives, some signal service!"<br/><br/>From this day, the thoughts of the inhabitants of Lincoln Island<br/>were solely occupied with the intended search. Everything incited<br/>them to discover the answer to this enigma, an answer which would<br/>only be the name of a man endowed with a truly inexplicable, and in<br/>some degree superhuman power.<br/><br/>In a few minutes, the settlers re-entered the house, where their<br/>influence soon restored to Ayrton his moral and physical energy.<br/>Neb and Pencroft carried the corpses of the convicts into the<br/>forest, some distance from the corral, and buried them deep in the<br/>ground.<br/><br/>Ayrton was then made acquainted with the facts which had<br/>occurred during his seclusion. He learned Herbert's adventures, and<br/>through what various trials the colonists had passed. As to the<br/>settlers, they had despaired of ever seeing Ayrton again, and had<br/>been convinced that the convicts had ruthlessly murdered him.<br/><br/>"And now," said Cyrus Harding, as he ended his recital, "a duty<br/>remains for us to perform. Half of our task is accomplished, but<br/>although the convicts are no longer to be feared, it is not owing<br/>to ourselves that we are once more masters of the island."<br/><br/>"Well!" answered Gideon Spilett, "let us search all this<br/>labyrinth of the spurs of Mount Franklin. We will not leave a<br/>hollow, not a hole unexplored! Ah! if ever a reporter found himself<br/>face to face with a mystery, it is I who now speak to you, my<br/>friends!"<br/><br/>"And we will not return to Granite House until we have found our<br/>benefactor," said Herbert.<br/>
