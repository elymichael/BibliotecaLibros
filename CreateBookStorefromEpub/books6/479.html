<br/>They walked at a good pace, a prey to the liveliest emotions.<br/>There was no doubt but that they were now going to learn the<br/>long-searched-for answer to the enigma, the name of that mysterious<br/>being, so deeply concerned in their life, so generous in his<br/>influence, so powerful in his action! Must not this stranger have<br/>indeed mingled with their existence, have known the smallest<br/>details, have heard all that was said in Granite House, to have<br/>been able always to act in the very nick of time?<br/><br/>Every one, wrapped up in his own reflections, pressed forward.<br/>Under the arch of trees the darkness was such that even the edge of<br/>the road could not be seen. Not a sound in the forest. Both animals<br/>and birds, influenced by the heaviness of the atmosphere, remained<br/>motionless and silent. Not a breath disturbed the leaves. The<br/>footsteps of the colonists alone resounded on the hardened<br/>ground.<br/><br/>During the first quarter of an hour the silence was only<br/>interrupted by this remark from Pencroft:—<br/><br/>"We ought to have brought a torch."<br/><br/>And by this reply from the engineer:—<br/><br/>"We shall find one at the corral."<br/><br/>Harding and his companions had left Granite House at twelve<br/>minutes past nine. At forty-seven minutes past nine they had<br/>traversed three out of the five miles which separated the mouth of<br/>the Mercy from the corral.<br/><br/>At that moment sheets of lightning spread over the island and<br/>illumined the dark trees. The flashes dazzled and almost blinded<br/>them. Evidently the storm would not be long in bursting forth.<br/><br/>The flashes gradually became brighter and more rapid. Distant<br/>thunder growled in the sky. The atmosphere was stifling.<br/><br/>The colonists proceeded as if they were urged onwards by some<br/>irresistible force.<br/><br/>
