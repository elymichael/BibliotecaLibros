"Yes," said Gideon Spilett, "but his reserve does him honor, and
it is right to respect the feeling which he has about his sad
past."

"Certainly, Mr. Spilett," answered the sailor, "and there is no
fear of my doing so again. I would rather bite my tongue off than
cause Ayrton any pain! But to return to the question. It seems to
me that these ruffians have no right to any pity, and that we ought
to rid the island of them as soon as possible."

"Is that your opinion, Pencroft?" asked the engineer.

"Quite my opinion."

"And before hunting them mercilessly, you would not wait until
they had committed some fresh act of hostility against us?"

"Isn't what they have done already enough?" asked Pencroft, who
did not understand these scruples.

"They may adopt other sentiments!" said Harding, "and perhaps
repent."

"They repent!" exclaimed the sailor, shrugging his
shoulders.

"Pencroft, think of Ayrton!" said Herbert, taking the sailor's
hand. "He became an honest man again!"

Pencroft looked at his companions one after the other. He had
never thought of his proposal being met with any objection. His
rough nature could not allow that they ought to come to terms with
the rascals who had landed on the island with Bob Harvey's
accomplices, the murderers of the crew of the "Speedy," and he
looked upon them as wild beasts which ought to be destroyed without
delay and without remorse.

"Come!" said be. "Everybody is against me! You wish to be
generous to those villains! Very well; I hope we mayn't repent
it!"
