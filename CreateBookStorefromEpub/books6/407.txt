"Why, Mr. Spilett," replied the sailor, "they would only have to
start in the night with a good breeze, and they would be out of
sight of the island in two hours."

"Well," resumed Gideon Spilett, "I ask again, what object could
the convicts have had in using the 'Bonadventure,' and why, after
they had made use of her, should they have brought her back to
port?"

"Why, Mr. Spilett," replied the sailor, "we must put that among
the unaccountable things, and not think anything more about it. The
chief thing is that the 'Bonadventure' was there, and she is there
now. Only, unfortunately, if the convicts take her a second time,
we shall very likely not find her again in her place!"

"Then, Pencroft," said Herbert, "would it not be wisest to bring
the 'Bonadventure' off to Granite House?"

"Yes and no," answered Pencroft, "or rather no. The mouth of the
Mercy is a bad place for a vessel, and the sea is heavy there."

"But by hauling her up on the sand, to the foot of the
Chimneys?"

"Perhaps yes," replied Pencroft. "At any rate, since we must
leave Granite House for a long expedition, I think the
'Bonadventure' will be safer here during our absence, and we shall
do best to leave her here until the island is rid of these
blackguards."

"That is exactly my opinion," said the reporter. "At any rate in
the event of bad weather, she will not be exposed here as she would
be at the mouth of the Mercy."

"But suppose the convicts pay her another visit," said
Herbert.

"Well, my boy," replied Pencroft, "not finding her here, they
would not be long in finding her on the sands of Granite House,
and, during our absence, nothing could hinder them from seizing
her! I agree, therefore, with Mr. Spilett, that she must be left in
Port Balloon. But, if on our return we have not rid the island of
those rascals, it will be prudent to bring our boat to Granite
House, until the time when we need not fear any unpleasant
visits."
