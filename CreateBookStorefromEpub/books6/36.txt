"That must be a jacamar," said Herbert, trying to get
nearer.

"This will be a good opportunity to taste jacamar," replied the
sailor, "if that fellow is in a humor to be roasted!"

Just then, a stone cleverly thrown by the boy, struck the
creature on the wing, but the blow did not disable it, and the
jacamar ran off and disappeared in an instant.

"How clumsy I am!" cried Herbert.

"No, no, my boy!" replied the sailor. "The blow was well aimed;
many a one would have missed it altogether! Come, don't be vexed
with yourself. We shall catch it another day!"

As the hunters advanced, the trees were found to be more
scattered, many being magnificent, but none bore eatable fruit.
Pencroft searched in vain for some of those precious palm-trees
which are employed in so many ways in domestic life, and which have
been found as far as the fortieth parallel in the Northern
Hemisphere, and to the thirty-fifth only in the Southern
Hemisphere. But this forest was only composed of coniferae, such as
deodaras, already recognized by Herbert, and Douglas pine, similar
to those which grow on the northwest coast of America, and splendid
firs, measuring a hundred and fifty feet in height.

At this moment a flock of birds, of a small size and pretty
plumage, with long glancing tails, dispersed themselves among the
branches strewing their feathers, which covered the ground as with
fine down. Herbert picked up a few of these feathers, and after
having examined them,—

"These are couroucous," said he.

"I should prefer a moor-cock or guinea-fowl," replied Pencroft,
"still, if they are good to eat—"

"They are good to eat, and also their flesh is very delicate,"
replied Herbert. "Besides, if I don't mistake, it is easy to
approach and kill them with a stick."
