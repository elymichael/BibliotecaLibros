This day, the 18th of March, there remained only provisions for
two days, although they limited their consumption to the bare
necessaries of life. All their science and intelligence could avail
them nothing in their present position. They were in the hand of
God.

Cyrus Harding was calm, Gideon Spilett more nervous, and
Pencroft, a prey to sullen anger, walked to and fro on the rock.
Herbert did not for a moment quit the engineer's side, as if
demanding from him that assistance he had no power to give. Neb and
Ayrton were resigned to their fate.

"Ah, what a misfortune! what a misfortune!" often repeated
Pencroft. "If we had but a walnut-shell to take us to Tabor Island!
But we have nothing, nothing!"

"Captain Nemo did right to die," said Neb.

During the five ensuing days Cyrus Harding and his unfortunate
companions husbanded their provisions with the most extreme care,
eating only what would prevent them from dying of starvation. Their
weakness was extreme. Herbert and Neb began to show symptoms of
delirium.

Under these circumstances was it possible for them to retain
even the shadow of a hope? No! What was their sole remaining
chance? That a vessel should appear in sight of the rock? But they
knew only too well from experience that no ships ever visited this
part of the Pacific. Could they calculate that, by a truly
providential coincidence, the Scotch yacht would arrive precisely
at this time in search of Ayrton at Tabor Island? It was scarcely
probable; and, besides, supposing she should come there, as the
colonists had not been able to deposit a notice pointing out
Ayrton's change of abode, the commander of the yacht, after having
explored Tabor Island without results, would again set sail and
return to lower latitudes.

No! no hope of being saved could be retained, and a horrible
death, death from hunger and thirst, awaited them upon this
rock.

Already they were stretched on the rock, inanimate, and no
longer conscious of what passed around them. Ayrton alone, by a
supreme effort, from time to time raised his head, and cast a
despairing glance over the desert ocean.

But on the morning of the 24th of March Ayrton's arms were
extended toward a point in the horizon; he raised himself, at first
on his knees, then upright, and his hand seemed to make a
signal.

A sail was in sight off the rock. She was evidently not without
an object. The reef was the mark for which she was making in a
direct line, under all steam, and the unfortunate colonists might
have made her out some hours before if they had had the strength to
watch the horizon.

"The 'Duncan'!" murmured Ayrtonâ€”and fell back without sign of
life.
