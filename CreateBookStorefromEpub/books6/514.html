Ayrton then proceeded to enter the corral, and, while awaiting<br/>the engineer's return, busied himself with the musmons and goats<br/>which seemed to feel a certain uneasiness in presence of these<br/>first signs of an eruption.<br/><br/>Meanwhile Cyrus Harding ascended the crest of the eastern spur,<br/>passed Red Creek, and arrived at the spot where he and his<br/>companions had discovered a sulphurous spring at the time of their<br/>first exploration.<br/><br/>How changed was everything! Instead of a single column of smoke<br/>he counted thirteen, forced through the soil as if violently<br/>propelled by some piston. It was evident that the crust of the<br/>earth was subjected in this part of the globe to a frightful<br/>pressure. The atmosphere was saturated with gases and carbonic<br/>acid, mingled with aqueous vapors. Cyrus Harding felt the volcanic<br/>tufa with which the plain was strewn, and which was but pulverized<br/>cinders hardened into solid blocks by time, tremble beneath him,<br/>but he could discover no traces of fresh lava.<br/><br/>The engineer became more assured of this when he observed all<br/>the northern part of Mount Franklin. Pillars of smoke and flame<br/>escaped from the crater; a hail of scoriae fell on the ground; but<br/>no current of lava burst from the mouth of the volcano, which<br/>proved that the volcanic matter had not yet attained the level of<br/>the superior orifice of the central shaft.<br/><br/>"But I would prefer that it were so," said Cyrus Harding to<br/>himself. "At any rate, I should then know that the lava had<br/>followed its accustomed track. who can say that it may not take a<br/>new course? But the danger does not consist in that! Captain Nemo<br/>foresaw it clearly! No, the danger does not lie there!"<br/><br/>Cyrus Harding advanced towards the enormous causeway whose<br/>prolongation enclosed the narrow Shark Gulf. He could now<br/>sufficiently examine on this side the ancient channels of the lava.<br/>There was no doubt in his mind that the most recent eruption had<br/>occurred at a far-distant epoch.<br/><br/>He then returned by the same way, listening attentively to the<br/>subterranean mutterings which rolled like long-continued thunder,<br/>interrupted by deafening explosions. At nine in the morning he<br/>reached the corral.<br/><br/>Ayrton awaited him.<br/><br/>"The animals are cared for, Captain Harding," said Ayrton.<br/><br/>"Good, Ayrton."<br/><br/>"They seem uneasy, Captain Harding."<br/>
