"Or rather it's very like it!" replied Neb.

"But the thermometer marks fifty-eight degrees!" observed Gideon
Spilett.

Cyrus Harding gazed at the sheet of white without saying
anything, for he really did not know how to explain this
phenomenon, at this time of year and in such a temperature.

"By Jove!" exclaimed Pencroft, "all our plants will be
frozen!"

And the sailor was about to descend, when he was preceded by the
nimble Jup, who slid down to the sand.

But the orang had not touched the ground, when the snowy sheet
arose and dispersed in the air in such innumerable flakes that the
light of the sun was obscured for some minutes.

"Birds!" cried Herbert.

They were indeed swarms of sea-birds, with dazzling white
plumage. They had perched by thousands on the islet and on the
shore, and they disappeared in the distance, leaving the colonists
amazed as if they had been present at some transformation scene, in
which summer succeeded winter at the touch of a fairy's wand.
Unfortunately the change had been so sudden, that neither the
reporter nor the lad had been able to bring down one of these
birds, of which they could not recognize the species.

A few days after came the 26th of March, the day on which, two
years before, the castaways from the air had been thrown upon
Lincoln Island.
