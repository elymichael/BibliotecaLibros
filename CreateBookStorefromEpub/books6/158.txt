This intense cold lasted till the 15th of August, without,
however, passing the degree of Fahrenheit already mentioned. When
the atmosphere was calm, the low temperature was easily borne, but
when the wind blew, the poor settlers, insufficiently clothed, felt
it severely. Pencroft regretted that Lincoln Island was not the
home of a few families of bears rather than of so many foxes and
seals.

"Bears," said he, "are generally very well dressed, and I ask no
more than to borrow for the winter the warm cloaks which they have
on their backs."

"But," replied Neb, laughing, "perhaps the bears would not
consent to give you their cloaks, Pencroft. These beasts are not
St. Martins."

"We would make them do it, Neb, we would make them," replied
Pencroft, in quite an authoritative tone.

But these formidable carnivora did not exist in the island, or
at any rate they had not yet shown themselves.

In the meanwhile, Herbert, Pencroft, and the reporter occupied
themselves with making traps on Prospect Heights and at the border
of the forest.
