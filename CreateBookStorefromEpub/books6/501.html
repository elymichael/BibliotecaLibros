The colonists listened reverently to the words of the dying<br/>man.<br/><br/>"To-morrow, after my death, Mr. Harding," continued the captain,<br/>"yourself and companions will leave the 'Nautilus,' for all the<br/>treasures it contains must perish with me. One token alone will<br/>remain with you of Prince Dakkar, with whose history you are now<br/>acquainted. That coffer yonder contains diamonds of the value of<br/>many millions, most of them mementoes of the time when, husband and<br/>father, I thought happiness possible for me, and a collection of<br/>pearls gathered by my friends and myself in the depths of the<br/>ocean. Of this treasure at a future day, you may make good use. In<br/>the hands of such men as yourself and your comrades, Captain<br/>Harding, money will never be a source of danger. From on high I<br/>shall still participate in your enterprises, and I fear not but<br/>that they will prosper."<br/><br/>After a few moments' repose, necessitated by his extreme<br/>weakness, Captain Nemo continued,—<br/><br/>"To-morrow you will take the coffer, you will leave the saloon,<br/>of which you will close the door; then you will ascend on to the<br/>deck of the 'Nautilus,' and you will lower the mainhatch so as<br/>entirely to close the vessel."<br/><br/>"It shall be done, captain," answered Cyrus Harding.<br/><br/>"Good. You will then embark in the canoe which brought you<br/>hither; but, before leaving the 'Nautilus,' go to the stern and<br/>there open two large stop-cocks which you will find upon the<br/>water-line. The water will penetrate into the reservoirs, and the<br/>'Nautilus' will gradually sink beneath the water to repose at the<br/>bottom of the abyss."<br/><br/>And comprehending a gesture of Cyrus Harding, the captain<br/>added,—<br/><br/>"Fear nothing! You will but bury a corpse!"<br/><br/>Neither Cyrus Harding nor his companions ventured to offer any<br/>observation to Captain Nemo. He had expressed his last wishes, and<br/>they had nothing to do but to conform to them.<br/><br/>"I have your promise, gentlemen?" added Captain Nemo.<br/><br/>"You have, captain," replied the engineer.<br/>
