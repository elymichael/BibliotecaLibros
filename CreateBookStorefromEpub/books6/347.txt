"There," exclaimed Pencroft, "our iron-clads can come here after
all! They would not run aground!"

"Indeed," said Gideon Spilett, "this gulf is a regular abyss,
but, taking into consideration the volcanic origin of the island,
it is not astonishing that the sea should offer similar
depressions."

"One would say too," observed Herbert, "that these cliffs were
perfectly perpendicular; and I believe that at their foot, even
with a line five or six times longer, Pencroft would not find
bottom."

"That is all very well," then said the reporter, "but I must
point out to Pencroft that his harbor is wanting in one very
important respect!"

"And what is that, Mr. Spilett?"

"An opening, a cutting of some sort, to give access to the
interior of the island. I do not see a spot on which we could
land." And, in fact, the steep lava cliffs did not afford a single
place suitable for landing. They formed an insuperable barrier,
recalling, but with more wildness, the fiords of Norway. The
"Bonadventure," coasting as close as possible along the cliffs, did
not discover even a projection which would allow the passengers to
leave the deck.

Pencroft consoled himself by saying that with the help of a mine
they could soon open out the cliff when that was necessary, and
then, as there was evidently nothing to be done in the gulf, he
steered his vessel towards the strait and passed out at about two
o'clock in the afternoon.

"Ah!" said Nab, uttering a sigh of satisfaction.

One might really say that the honest Negro did not feel at his
ease in those enormous jaws.

The distance from Mandible Cape to the mouth of the Mercy was
not more than eight miles. The head of the "Bonadventure" was put
towards Granite House, and a fair wind filling her sails, she ran
rapidly along the coast.
