<br/>It was evident that this chest had been thrown overboard from<br/>some dismasted vessel driven towards the island, and that, in the<br/>hope that it would reach the land, where they might afterwards find<br/>it, the passengers had taken the precaution to buoy it up by means<br/>of this floating apparatus.<br/><br/>"We will tow this chest to Granite House," said the engineer,<br/>"where we can make an inventory of its contents; then, if we<br/>discover any of the survivors from the supposed wreck, we can<br/>return it to those to whom it belongs. If we find no one—"<br/><br/>"We will keep it for ourselves!" cried Pencroft. "But what in<br/>the world can there be in it?"<br/><br/>The sea was already approaching the chest, and the high tide<br/>would evidently float it. One of the ropes which fastened the<br/>barrels was partly unlashed and used as a cable to unite the<br/>floating apparatus with the canoe. Pencroft and Neb then dug away<br/>the sand with their oars, so as to facilitate the moving of the<br/>chest, towing which the boat soon began to double the point, to<br/>which the name of Flotsam Point was given.<br/><br/>The chest was heavy, and the barrels were scarcely sufficient to<br/>keep it above water. The sailor also feared every instant that it<br/>would get loose and sink to the bottom of the sea. But happily his<br/>fears were not realized, and an hour and a half after they set<br/>out—all that time had been taken up in going a distance of three<br/>miles—the boat touched the beach below Granite House.<br/><br/>Canoe and chest were then hauled up on the sands; and as the<br/>tide was then going out, they were soon left high and dry. Neb,<br/>hurrying home, brought back some tools with which to open the chest<br/>in such a way that it might be injured as little as possible, and<br/>they proceeded to its inventory. Pencroft did not try to hide that<br/>he was greatly excited.<br/><br/>The sailor began by detaching the two barrels, which, being in<br/>good condition, would of course be of use. Then the locks were<br/>forced with a cold chisel and hammer, and the lid thrown back. A<br/>second casing of zinc lined the interior of the chest, which had<br/>been evidently arranged that the articles which it enclosed might<br/>under any circumstances be sheltered from damp.<br/><br/>"Oh!" cried Neb, "suppose it's jam!<br/><br/>"I hope not," replied the reporter.<br/><br/>"If only there was—" said the sailor in a low voice.<br/><br/>
