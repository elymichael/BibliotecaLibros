"About thirty miles," replied the engineer, "if we take into
consideration the curvings of the coast."

"Thirty miles!" returned Spilett. "That would be a long day's
march. Nevertheless, I think that we should return to Granite House
by the south coast."

"But," observed Herbert, "from Claw Cape to Granite House there
must be at least another ten miles.

"Make it forty miles in all," replied the engineer, "and do not
hesitate to do it. At least we should survey the unknown shore, and
then we shall not have to begin the exploration again."

"Very good," said Pencroft. "But the boat?"

"The boat has remained by itself for one day at the sources of
the Mercy," replied Gideon Spilett; "it may just as well stay there
two days! As yet, we have had no reason to think that the island is
infested by thieves!"

"Yet," said the sailor, "when I remember the history of the
turtle, I am far from confident of that."

"The turtle! the turtle!" replied the reporter. "Don't you know
that the sea turned it over?"

"Who knows?" murmured the engineer.

"But,â€”" said Neb.

Neb had evidently something to say, for he opened his mouth to
speak and yet said nothing.
