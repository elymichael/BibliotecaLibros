<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>4<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>It was six o' clock in the morning when the settlers, after a<br/>hasty breakfast, set out to reach by the shortest way, the western<br/>coast of the island. And how long would it take to do this? Cyrus<br/>Harding had said two hours, but of course that depended on the<br/>nature of the obstacles they might meet with As it was probable<br/>that they would have to cut a path through the grass, shrubs, and<br/>creepers, they marched axe in hand, and with guns also ready,<br/>wisely taking warning from the cries of the wild beasts heard in<br/>the night.<br/><br/>The exact position of the encampment could be determined by the<br/>bearing of Mount Franklin, and as the volcano arose in the north at<br/>a distance of less than three miles, they had only to go straight<br/>towards the southwest to reach the western coast. They set out,<br/>having first carefully secured the canoe. Pencroft and Neb carried<br/>sufficient provision for the little band for at least two days. It<br/>would not thus be necessary to hunt. The engineer advised his<br/>companions to refrain from firing, that their presence might not be<br/>betrayed to any one near the shore. The first hatchet blows were<br/>given among the brushwood in the midst of some mastic-trees, a<br/>little above the cascade; and his compass in his hand, Cyrus<br/>Harding led the way.<br/><br/>The forest here was composed for the most part of trees which<br/>had already been met with near the lake and on Prospect Heights.<br/>There were deodars, Douglas firs, casuarinas, gum trees, eucalypti,<br/>hibiscus, cedars, and other trees, generally of a moderate size,<br/>for their number prevented their growth.<br/><br/>Since their departure, the settlers had descended the slopes<br/>which constituted the mountain system of the island, on to a dry<br/>soil, but the luxuriant vegetation of which indicated it to be<br/>watered either by some subterranean marsh or by some stream.<br/>However, Cyrus Harding did not remember having seen, at the time of<br/>his excursion to the crater, any other watercourses but the Red<br/>Creek and the Mercy.<br/><br/>During the first part of their excursion, they saw numerous<br/>troops of monkeys who exhibited great astonishment at the sight of<br/>men, whose appearance was so new to them. Gideon Spilett jokingly<br/>asked whether these active and merry quadrupeds did not consider<br/>him and his companions as degenerate brothers.<br/><br/>And certainly, pedestrians, hindered at each step by bushes,<br/>caught by creepers, barred by trunks of trees, did not shine beside<br/>those supple animals, who, bounding from branch to branch, were<br/>hindered by nothing on their course. The monkeys were numerous, but<br/>happily they did not manifest any hostile disposition.<br/><br/>
