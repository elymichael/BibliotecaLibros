<br/>While eating they looked around them. This part of Lincoln<br/>Island was very sterile, and contrasted with all the western part.<br/>The reporter was thus led to observe that if chance had thrown them<br/>at first on the shore, they would have had but a deplorable idea of<br/>their future domain.<br/><br/>"I believe that we should not have been able to reach it,"<br/>replied the engineer, "for the sea is deep, and there is not a rock<br/>on which we could have taken refuge. Before Granite House, at<br/>least, there were sandbanks, an islet, which multiplied our chances<br/>of safety. Here, nothing but the depths!"<br/><br/>"It is singular enough," remarked Spilett, "that this<br/>comparatively small island should present such varied ground. This<br/>diversity of aspect, logically only belongs to continents of a<br/>certain extent. One would really say, that the western part of<br/>Lincoln Island, so rich and so fertile, is washed by the warm<br/>waters of the Gulf of Mexico, and that its shores to the north and<br/>the southeast extend over a sort of Arctic sea."<br/><br/>"You are right, my dear Spilett," replied Cyrus Harding, "I have<br/>also observed this. I think the form and also the nature of this<br/>island strange. It is a summary of all the aspects which a<br/>continent presents, and I should not be surprised if it was a<br/>continent formerly."<br/><br/>"What! a continent in the middle of the Pacific?" cried<br/>Pencroft.<br/><br/>"Why not?" replied Cyrus Harding. "Why should not Australia, New<br/>Ireland, Australasia, united to the archipelagoes of the Pacific,<br/>have once formed a sixth part of the world, as important as Europe<br/>or Asia, as Africa or the two Americas? To my mind, it is quite<br/>possible that all these islands, emerging from this vast ocean, are<br/>but the summits of a continent, now submerged, but which was above<br/>the waters at a prehistoric period."<br/><br/>"As the Atlantis was formerly," replied Herbert.<br/><br/>"Yes, my boyâ€¦ if, however, it existed."<br/><br/>"And would Lincoln Island have been a part of that continent?"<br/>asked Pencroft.<br/><br/>"It is probable," replied Cyrus Harding, "and that would<br/>sufficiently, explain the variety of productions which are seen on<br/>its surface."<br/><br/>
