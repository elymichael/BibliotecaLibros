<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>"Are we rising again?" "No. On the contrary." "Are we<br/>descending?" "Worse than that, captain! we are falling!" "For<br/>Heaven's sake heave out the ballast!" "There! the last sack is<br/>empty!" "Does the balloon rise?" "No!" "I hear a noise like the<br/>dashing of waves. The sea is below the car! It cannot be more than<br/>500 feet from us!" "Overboard with every weight!&#160;â€¦<br/>everything!"<br/><br/>Such were the loud and startling words which resounded through<br/>the air, above the vast watery desert of the Pacific, about four<br/>o'clock in the evening of the 23rd of March, 1865.<br/><br/>Few can possibly have forgotten the terrible storm from the<br/>northeast, in the middle of the equinox of that year. The tempest<br/>raged without intermission from the 18th to the 26th of March. Its<br/>ravages were terrible in America, Europe, and Asia, covering a<br/>distance of eighteen hundred miles, and extending obliquely to the<br/>equator from the thirty-fifth north parallel to the fortieth south<br/>parallel. Towns were overthrown, forests uprooted, coasts<br/>devastated by the mountains of water which were precipitated on<br/>them, vessels cast on the shore, which the published accounts<br/>numbered by hundreds, whole districts leveled by waterspouts which<br/>destroyed everything they passed over, several thousand people<br/>crushed on land or drowned at sea; such were the traces of its<br/>fury, left by this devastating tempest. It surpassed in disasters<br/>those which so frightfully ravaged Havana and Guadalupe, one on the<br/>25th of October, 1810, the other on the 26th of July, 1825.<br/><br/>But while so many catastrophes were taking place on land and at<br/>sea, a drama not less exciting was being enacted in the agitated<br/>air.<br/><br/>In fact, a balloon, as a ball might be carried on the summit of<br/>a waterspout, had been taken into the circling movement of a column<br/>of air and had traversed space at the rate of ninety miles an hour,<br/>turning round and round as if seized by some aerial maelstrom.<br/><br/>Beneath the lower point of the balloon swung a car, containing<br/>five passengers, scarcely visible in the midst of the thick vapor<br/>mingled with spray which hung over the surface of the ocean.<br/><br/>
