"Captain Nemo!" exclaimed the colonists.

"Yes, and it was the last service he desired to render us before
his death!"

"The last service!" exclaimed Pencroft, "the last service! You
will see that though he is dead he will render us others yet!"

"But what did the captain say?" inquired the reporter.

"I will tell you, my friends," said the engineer. "Lincoln
Island does not resemble the other islands of the Pacific, and a
fact of which Captain Nemo has made me cognizant must sooner or
later bring about the subversion of its foundation."

"Nonsense! Lincoln Island, it can't be!" cried Pencroft, who, in
spite of the respect he felt for Cyrus Harding, could not prevent a
gesture of incredulity.

"Listen, Pencroft," resumed the engineer, "I will tell you what
Captain Nemo communicated to me, and which I myself confirmed
yesterday, during the exploration of Dakkar Grotto.

"This cavern stretches under the island as far as the volcano,
and is only separated from its central shaft by the wall which
terminates it. Now, this wall is seamed with fissures and clefts
which already allow the sulphurous gases generated in the interior
of the volcano to escape."

"Well?" said Pencroft, his brow suddenly contracting.

"Well, then, I saw that these fissures widen under the internal
pressure from within, that the wall of basalt is gradually giving
way and that after a longer or shorter period it will afford a
passage to the waters of the lake which fill the cavern."

"Good!" replied Pencroft, with an attempt at pleasantry. "The
sea will extinguish the volcano, and there will be an end of the
matter!"
