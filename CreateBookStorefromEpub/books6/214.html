If they had been living in the time of genii, this incident<br/>would have given them the right to think that the island was<br/>haunted by some supernatural being, who used his power in the<br/>service of the castaways!<br/><br/>A few strokes of the oar brought the settlers to the mouth of<br/>the Mercy. The canoe was hauled up on the beach near the Chimneys,<br/>and all proceeded towards the ladder of Granite House.<br/><br/>But at that moment, Top barked angrily, and Neb, who was looking<br/>for the first steps, uttered a cry.<br/><br/>There was no longer a ladder!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
