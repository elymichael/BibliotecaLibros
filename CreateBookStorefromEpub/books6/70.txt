The captain and the reporter were there. Pencroft looked from one

"The sun!"

Gideon Spilett was quite right in his reply. It was the sun
which had furnished the heat which so astonished Pencroft. The
sailor could scarcely believe his eyes, and he was so amazed that
he did not think of questioning the engineer.
