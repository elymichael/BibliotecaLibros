<br/>As to Gideon Spilett, he devoured the shell-fish, then he laid<br/>himself down on the sand, at the foot of a rock. He was very weak,<br/>but calm. Herbert went up to him, and taking his hand, "Sir," said<br/>he, "we have found a shelter which will be better than lying here.<br/>Night is advancing. Come and rest! To-morrow we will search<br/>farther."<br/><br/>The reporter got up, and guided by the boy went towards the<br/>cave. On the way, Pencroft asked him in the most natural tone, if<br/>by chance he happened to have a match or two.<br/><br/>The reporter stopped, felt in his pockets, but finding nothing<br/>said, "I had some, but I must have thrown them away."<br/><br/>The seaman then put the same question to Neb and received the<br/>same answer.<br/><br/>"Confound it!" exclaimed the sailor.<br/><br/>The reporter heard him and seizing his arm, "Have you no<br/>matches?" he asked.<br/><br/>"Not one, and no fire in consequence."<br/><br/>"Ah!" cried Neb, "if my master was here, he would know what to<br/>do!"<br/><br/>The four castaways remained motionless, looking uneasily at each<br/>other. Herbert was the first to break the silence by saying, "Mr.<br/>Spilett, you are a smoker and always have matches about you;<br/>perhaps you haven't looked well, try again, a single match will be<br/>enough!"<br/><br/>The reporter hunted again in the pockets of his trousers,<br/>waistcoat, and great-coat, and at last to Pencroft's great joy, no<br/>less to his extreme surprise, he felt a tiny piece of wood<br/>entangled in the lining of his waistcoat. He seized it with his<br/>fingers through the stuff, but he could not get it out. If this was<br/>a match and a single one, it was of great importance not to rub off<br/>the phosphorus.<br/><br/>
