<br/>The hunters had scarcely entered the bushes when they saw Top<br/>engaged in a struggle with an animal which he was holding by the<br/>ear. This quadruped was a sort of pig nearly two feet and a half<br/>long, of a blackish brown color, lighter below, having hard scanty<br/>hair; its toes, then strongly fixed in the ground, seemed to be<br/>united by a membrane. Herbert recognized in this animal the<br/>capybara, that is to say, one of the largest members of the rodent<br/>order.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the capybara did not struggle against the dog. It<br/>stupidly rolled its eyes, deeply buried in a thick bed of fat.<br/>Perhaps it saw men for the first time.<br/><br/>However, Neb having tightened his grasp on his stick, was just<br/>going to fell the pig, when the latter, tearing itself from Top's<br/>teeth, by which it was only held by the tip of its ear, uttered a<br/>vigorous grunt, rushed upon Herbert, almost overthrew him, and<br/>disappeared in the wood.<br/><br/>"The rascal!" cried Pencroft.<br/><br/>All three directly darted after Top, but at the moment when they<br/>joined him the animal had disappeared under the waters of a large<br/>pond shaded by venerable pines.<br/><br/>Neb, Herbert, and Pencroft stopped, motionless. Top plunged into<br/>the water, but the capybara, hidden at the bottom of the pond, did<br/>not appear.<br/><br/>"Let us wait," said the boy, "for he will soon come to the<br/>surface to breathe."<br/><br/>"Won't he drown?" asked Neb.<br/><br/>"No," replied Herbert, "since he has webbed feet, and is almost<br/>an amphibious animal. But watch him."<br/><br/>Top remained in the water. Pencroft and his two companions went<br/>to different parts of the bank, so as to cut off the retreat of the<br/>capybara, which the dog was looking for beneath the water.<br/><br/>
