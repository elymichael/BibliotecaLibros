"Asparagus thirty feet high!" exclaimed the sailor. "And are
they good?"

"Excellent," replied Herbert. "Only it is not the stems of
thirty feet high which are eaten, but the young shoots."

"Perfect, my boy, perfect!" replied Pencroft.

"I will also add that the pith of the young stalks, preserved in
vinegar, makes a good pickle."

"Better and better, Herbert!"

"And lastly, that the bamboos exude a sweet liquor which can be
made into a very agreeable drink."

"Is that all?" asked the sailor.

"That is all!"

"And they don't happen to do for smoking?"

"No, my poor Pencroft."

Herbert and the sailor had not to look long for a place in which
to pass the night. The rocks, which must have been violently beaten
by the sea under the influence of the winds of the southwest,
presented many cavities in which shelter could be found against the
night air. But just as they were about to enter one of these caves
a loud roaring arrested them.
