"With the increasing consumption of coal," replied Gideon
Spilett, "it can be foreseen that the hundred thousand workmen will
soon become two hundred thousand, and that the rate of extraction
will be doubled."

"Doubtless; but after the European mines, which will be soon
worked more thoroughly with new machines, the American and
Australian mines will for a long time yet provide for the
consumption in trade."

"For how long a time?" asked the reporter.

"For at least two hundred and fifty or three hundred years."

"That is reassuring for us, but a bad look-out for our great-
grandchildren!" observed Pencroft.

"They will discover something else," said Herbert.

"It is to be hoped so," answered Spilett, "for without coal
there would be no machinery, and without machinery there would be
no railways, no steamers, no manufactories, nothing of that which
is indispensable to modern civilization!"

"But what will they find?" asked Pencroft. "Can you guess,
captain?"

"Nearly, my friend."

"And what will they burn instead of coal?"

"Water," replied Harding.
