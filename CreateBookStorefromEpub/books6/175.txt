"And now, what shall we do with our prize?" said Neb. "We can't
drag it to Granite House!"

"Leave it here, since it cannot turn over," replied Herbert,
"and we will come back with the cart to fetch it."

"That is the best plan."

However, for greater precaution, Herbert took the trouble, which
Neb deemed superfluous, to wedge up the animal with great stones;
after which the two hunters returned to Granite House, following
the beach, which the tide had left uncovered. Herbert, wishing to
surprise Pencroft, said nothing about the "superb specimen of a
chelonian" which they had turned over on the sand; but, two hours
later, he and Neb returned with the cart to the place where they
had left it. The "superb specimen of a chelonian" was no longer
there!

Neb and Herbert stared at each other first; then they stared
about them. It was just at this spot that the turtle had been left.
The lad even found the stones which he had used, and therefore he
was certain of not being mistaken.

"Well!" said Neb, "these beasts can turn themselves over,
then?''

"It appears so," replied Herbert, who could not understand it at
all, and was gazing at the stones scattered on the sand.

"Well, Pencroft will be disgusted!"

"And Captain Harding will perhaps be very perplexed how to
explain this disappearance," thought Herbert.

"Look here," said Neb, who wished to hide his ill-luck, "we
won't speak about it."

"On the contrary, Neb, we must speak about it," replied
Herbert.
