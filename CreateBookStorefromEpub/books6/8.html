<br/>It was impossible to prevent the escape of gas, which rushed<br/>through a large rent in the silk. By lightening the car of all the<br/>articles which it contained, the passengers had been able to<br/>prolong their suspension in the air for a few hours. But the<br/>inevitable catastrophe could only be retarded, and if land did not<br/>appear before night, voyagers, car, and balloon must to a certainty<br/>vanish beneath the waves.<br/><br/>They now resorted to the only remaining expedient. They were<br/>truly dauntless men, who knew how to look death in the face. Not a<br/>single murmur escaped from their lips. They were determined to<br/>struggle to the last minute, to do anything to retard their fall.<br/>The car was only a sort of willow basket, unable to float, and<br/>there was not the slightest possibility of maintaining it on the<br/>surface of the sea.<br/><br/>Two more hours passed and the balloon was scarcely 400 feet<br/>above the water.<br/><br/>At that moment a loud voice, the voice of a man whose heart was<br/>inaccessible to fear, was heard. To this voice responded others not<br/>less determined. "Is everything thrown out?" "No, here are still<br/>2,000 dollars in gold." A heavy bag immediately plunged into the<br/>sea. "Does the balloon rise?" "A little, but it will not be long<br/>before it falls again." "What still remains to be thrown out?"<br/>"Nothing." "Yes! the car!" "Let us catch hold of the net, and into<br/>the sea with the car."<br/><br/>This was, in fact, the last and only mode of lightening the<br/>balloon. The ropes which held the car were cut, and the balloon,<br/>after its fall, mounted 2,000 feet. The five voyagers had hoisted<br/>themselves into the net, and clung to the meshes, gazing at the<br/>abyss.<br/><br/>The delicate sensibility of balloons is well known. It is<br/>sufficient to throw out the lightest article to produce a<br/>difference in its vertical position. The apparatus in the air is<br/>like a balance of mathematical precision. It can be thus easily<br/>understood that when it is lightened of any considerable weight its<br/>movement will be impetuous and sudden. So it happened on this<br/>occasion. But after being suspended for an instant aloft, the<br/>balloon began to redescend, the gas escaping by the rent which it<br/>was impossible to repair.<br/><br/>The men had done all that men could do. No human efforts could<br/>save them now.<br/><br/>They must trust to the mercy of Him who rules the elements.<br/><br/>At four o'clock the balloon was only 500 feet above the surface<br/>of the water.<br/><br/>A loud barking was heard. A dog accompanied the voyagers, and<br/>was held pressed close to his master in the meshes of the net.<br/><br/>
