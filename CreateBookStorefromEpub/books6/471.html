<br/>The month of April was tolerably fine, as October often is in<br/>the northern zone. At the same time other work was actively<br/>continued, and soon all trace of devastation disappeared from the<br/>plateau of Prospect Heights. The mill was rebuilt, and new<br/>buildings rose in the poultry-yard. It had appeared necessary to<br/>enlarge their dimensions, for the feathered population had<br/>increased considerably. The stable now contained five onagers, four<br/>of which were well broken, and allowed themselves to be either<br/>driven or ridden, and a little colt. The colony now possessed a<br/>plow, to which the onagers were yoked like regular Yorkshire or<br/>Kentucky oxen. The colonists divided their work, and their arms<br/>never tired. Then who could have enjoyed better health than these<br/>workers, and what good humor enlivened the evenings in Granite<br/>House as they formed a thousand plans for the future!<br/><br/>As a matter of course Ayrton shared the common lot in every<br/>respect, and there was no longer any talk of his going to live at<br/>the corral. Nevertheless he was still sad and reserved, and joined<br/>more in the work than in the pleasures of his companions. But he<br/>was a valuable workman at need—strong, skilful, ingenious,<br/>intelligent. He was esteemed and loved by all, and he could not be<br/>ignorant of it.<br/><br/>In the meanwhile the corral was not abandoned. Every other day<br/>one of the settlers, driving the cart or mounted on an onager, went<br/>to look after the flock of musmons and goats and bring back the<br/>supply of milk required by Neb. These excursions at the same time<br/>afforded opportunities for hunting. Therefore Herbert and Gideon<br/>Spilett, with Top in front, traversed more often than their<br/>companions the road to the corral, and with the capital guns which<br/>they carried, capybaras, agouties, kangaroos, and wild pigs for<br/>large game, ducks, grouse, jacamars, and snipe for small game, were<br/>never wanting in the house. The produce of the warren, of the<br/>oyster-bed, several turtles which were taken, excellent salmon<br/>which came up the Mercy, vegetables from the plateau, wild fruit<br/>from the forest, were riches upon riches, and Neb, the head cook,<br/>could scarcely by himself store them away.<br/><br/>The telegraphic wire between the corral and Granite House had of<br/>course been repaired, and it was worked whenever one or other of<br/>the settlers was at the corral and found it necessary to spend the<br/>night there. Besides, the island was safe now and no attacks were<br/>to be feared, at any rate from men.<br/><br/>However, that which had happened might happen again. A descent<br/>of pirates, or even of escaped convicts, was always to be feared.<br/>It was possible that companions or accomplices of Bob Harvey had<br/>been in the secret of his plans, and might be tempted to imitate<br/>him. The colonists, therefore, were careful to observe the sea<br/>around the island, and every day their telescope covered the<br/>horizon enclosed by Union and Washington Bays. when they went to<br/>the corral they examined the sea to the west with no less<br/>attention, and by climbing the spur their gaze extended over a<br/>large section of the western horizon.<br/><br/>Nothing suspicious was discerned, but still it was necessary for<br/>them to be on their guard.<br/><br/>The engineer one evening imparted to his friends a plan which he<br/>had conceived for fortifying the corral. It appeared prudent to him<br/>to heighten the palisade and to flank it with a sort of blockhouse,<br/>which, if necessary, the settlers could hold against the enemy.<br/>Granite House might, by its very position, be considered<br/>impregnable; therefore the corral with its buildings, its stores,<br/>and the animals it contained, would always be the object of<br/>pirates, whoever they were, who might land on the island, and<br/>should the colonists be obliged to shut themselves up there they<br/>ought also to be able to defend themselves without any<br/>disadvantage. This was a project which might be left for<br/>consideration, and they were, besides, obliged to put off its<br/>execution until the next spring.<br/><br/>About the 15th of May the keel of the new vessel lay along the<br/>dockyard, and soon the stem and stern-post, mortised at each of its<br/>extremities, rose almost perpendicularly. The keel, of good oak,<br/>measured 110 feet in length, this allowing a width of<br/>five-and-twenty feet to the midship beam. But this was all the<br/>carpenters could do before the arrival of the frosts and bad<br/>weather. During the following week they fixed the first of the<br/>stern timbers, but were then obliged to suspend work.<br/><br/>During the last days of the month the weather was extremely bad.<br/>The wind blew from the east, sometimes with the violence of a<br/>tempest. The engineer was somewhat uneasy on account of the<br/>dockyard shed—which besides, he could not have established in any<br/>other place near to Granite House—for the islet only imperfectly<br/>sheltered the shore from the fury of the open sea, and in great<br/>storms the waves beat against the very foot of the granite<br/>cliff.<br/><br/>But, very fortunately, these fears were not realized. The wind<br/>shifted to the southeast, and there the beach of Granite House was<br/>completely covered by Flotsam Point.<br/><br/>
