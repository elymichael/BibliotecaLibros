<br/>"Bread, cakes, tarts!" replied the sailor. "Come, the bread that<br/>this grain of corn will make won't choke us very soon!"<br/><br/>Herbert, not attaching much importance to his discovery, was<br/>going to throw away the grain in question; but Harding took it,<br/>examined it, found that it was in good condition, and looking the<br/>sailor full in the faceâ€” "Pencroft," he asked quietly, "do you know<br/>how many ears one grain of corn can produce?"<br/><br/>"One, I suppose!" replied the sailor, surprised at the<br/>question.<br/><br/>"Ten, Pencroft! And do you know how many grains one ear<br/>bears?"<br/><br/>"No, upon my word."<br/><br/>"About eighty!" said Cyrus Harding. "Then, if we plant this<br/>grain, at the first crop we shall reap eight hundred grains which<br/>at the second will produce six hundred and forty thousand; at the<br/>third, five hundred and twelve millions; at the fourth, more than<br/>four hundred thousands of millions! There is the proportion."<br/><br/>Harding's companions listened without answering. These numbers<br/>astonished them. They were exact, however.<br/><br/>"Yes, my friends," continued the engineer, "such are the<br/>arithmetical progressions of prolific nature; and yet what is this<br/>multiplication of the grain of corn, of which the ear only bears<br/>eight hundred grains, compared to the poppy-plant, which bears<br/>thirty-two thousand seeds; to the tobacco- plant, which produces<br/>three hundred and sixty thousand? In a few years, without the<br/>numerous causes of destruction, which arrests their fecundity,<br/>these plants would overrun the earth."<br/><br/>But the engineer had not finished his lecture.<br/><br/>"And now, Pencroft," he continued, "do you know how many bushels<br/>four hundred thousand millions of grains would make?"<br/><br/>
