<br/>All approached, and saw to their extreme surprise, a boat<br/>floating down the current.<br/><br/>"Boat ahoy!" shouted the sailor, without thinking that perhaps<br/>it would be best to keep silence.<br/><br/>No reply. The boat still drifted onward, and it was not more<br/>than twelve feet off, when the sailor exclaimed,â€”<br/><br/>"But it is our own boat! she has broken her moorings, and<br/>floated down the current. I must say she has arrived very<br/>opportunely."<br/><br/>"Our boat?" murmured the engineer.<br/><br/>Pencroft was right. It was indeed the canoe, of which the rope<br/>had undoubtedly broken, and which had come alone from the sources<br/>of the Mercy. It was very important to seize it before the rapid<br/>current should have swept it away out of the mouth of the river,<br/>but Neb and Pencroft cleverly managed this by means of a long<br/>pole.<br/><br/>The canoe touched the shore. The engineer leaped in first, and<br/>found, on examining the rope, that it had been really worn through<br/>by rubbing against the rocks.<br/><br/>"Well," said the reporter to him, in a low voice, "this is a<br/>strange thing."<br/><br/>"Strange indeed!" returned Cyrus Harding.<br/><br/>Strange or not, it was very fortunate. Herbert, the reporter,<br/>Neb, and Pencroft, embarked in turn. There was no doubt about the<br/>rope having been worn through, but the astonishing part of the<br/>affair was, that the boat should arrive just at the moment when the<br/>settlers were there to seize it on its way, for a quarter of an<br/>hour earlier or later it would have been lost in the sea.<br/><br/>
