Three years had passed away since the escape of the prisoners
from Richmond, and how often during those three years had they
spoken of their country, always present in their thoughts!

They had no doubt that the civil war was at an end, and to them
it appeared impossible that the just cause of the North had not
triumphed. But what had been the incidents of this terrible war?
How much blood had it not cost? How many of their friends must have
fallen in the struggle? They often spoke of these things, without
as yet being able to foresee the day when they would be permitted
once more to see their country. To return thither, were it but for
a few days, to renew the social link with the inhabited world, to
establish a communication between their native land and their
island, then to pass the longest, perhaps the best, portion of
their existence in this colony, founded by them, and which would
then be dependent on their country, was this a dream impossible to
realize?

There were only two ways of accomplishing it—either a ship must
appear off Lincoln Island, or the colonists must themselves build a
vessel strong enough to sail to the nearest land.

"Unless," said Pencroft, "our good genius, himself provides us
with the means of returning to our country."

And, really, had any one told Pencroft and Neb that a ship of
300 tons was waiting for them in Shark Gulf or at Port Balloon,
they would not even have made a gesture of surprise. In their state
of mind nothing appeared improbable.

But Cyrus Harding, less confident, advised them to confine
themselves to fact, and more especially so with regard to the
building of a vessel—a really urgent work, since it was for the
purpose of depositing, as soon as possible, at Tabor Island a
document indicating Ayrton's new residence.
