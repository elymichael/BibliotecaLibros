"But is he equal to five?" asked the engineer.<br/><br/>"I will join Pencroft," said the reporter, "and both of us,<br/>well-armed and accompanied by Topâ€”"<br/><br/>"My dear Spilett, and you, Pencroft," answered Harding, "let us<br/>reason coolly. If the convicts were hid in one spot of the island,<br/>if we knew that spot, and had only to dislodge them, I would<br/>undertake a direct attack; but is there not occasion to fear, on<br/>the contrary, that they are sure to fire the first shot?"<br/><br/>"Well, captain," cried Pencroft, "a bullet does not always reach<br/>its mark."<br/><br/>"That which struck Herbert did not miss, Pencroft," replied the<br/>engineer. "Besides, observe that if both of you left the corral I<br/>should remain here alone to defend it. Do you imagine that the<br/>convicts will not see you leave it, that they will not allow you to<br/>enter the forest, and that they will not attack it during your<br/>absence, knowing that there is no one here but a wounded boy and a<br/>man?"<br/><br/>"You are right, captain," replied Pencroft, his chest swelling<br/>with sullen anger. "You are right; they will do all they can to<br/>retake the corral, which they know to be well stored; and alone you<br/>could not hold it against them."<br/><br/>"Oh, if we were only at Granite House!"<br/><br/>"If we were at Granite House," answered the engineer, "the case<br/>would be very different. There I should not be afraid to leave<br/>Herbert with one, while the other three went to search the forests<br/>of the island. But we are at the corral, and it is best to stay<br/>here until we can leave it together."<br/><br/>Cyrus Harding's reasoning was unanswerable, and his companions<br/>understood it well.<br/><br/>"If only Ayrton was still one of us!" said Gideon Spilett. "Poor<br/>fellow! his return to social life will have been but of short<br/>duration."<br/><br/>"If he is dead," added Pencroft, in a peculiar tone.<br/>
