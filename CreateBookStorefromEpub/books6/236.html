<br/>They had also a variety of different beverages, and so long as<br/>they did not demand wine, the most hard to please would have had no<br/>reason to complain. To the Oswego tea, and the fermented liquor<br/>extracted from the roots of the dragonnier, Harding had added a<br/>regular beer, made from the young shoots of the spruce-fir, which,<br/>after having been boiled and fermented, made that agreeable drink<br/>called by the Anglo-Americans spring- beer.<br/><br/>Towards the end of the summer, the poultry-yard was possessed of<br/>a couple of fine bustards, which belonged to the houbara species,<br/>characterized by a sort of feathery mantle; a dozen shovelers,<br/>whose upper mandible was prolonged on each side by a membraneous<br/>appendage; and also some magnificent cocks, similar to the<br/>Mozambique cocks, the comb, caruncle, and epidermis being black. So<br/>far, everything had succeeded, thanks to the activity of these<br/>courageous and intelligent men. Nature did much for them,<br/>doubtless; but faithful to the great precept, they made a right use<br/>of what a bountiful Providence gave them.<br/><br/>After the heat of these warm summer days, in the evening when<br/>their work was finished and the sea-breeze began to blow, they<br/>liked to sit on the edge of Prospect Heights, in a sort of veranda,<br/>covered with creepers, which Neb had made with his own hands. There<br/>they talked, they instructed each other, they made plans, and the<br/>rough good-humor of the sailor always amused this little world, in<br/>which the most perfect harmony had never ceased to reign.<br/><br/>They often spoke of their country, of their dear and great<br/>America. What was the result of the War of Secession? It could not<br/>have been greatly prolonged. Richmond had doubtless soon fallen<br/>into the hands of General Grant. The taking of the capital of the<br/>Confederates must have been the last action of this terrible<br/>struggle. Now the North had triumphed in the good cause, how<br/>welcome would have been a newspaper to the exiles in Lincoln<br/>Island! For eleven months all communication between them and the<br/>rest of their fellow-creatures had been interrupted, and in a short<br/>time the 24th of March would arrive, the anniversary of the day on<br/>which the balloon had thrown them on this unknown coast. They were<br/>then mere castaways, not even knowing how they should preserve<br/>their miserable lives from the fury of the elements! And now,<br/>thanks to the knowledge of their captain, and their own<br/>intelligence, they were regular colonists, furnished with arms,<br/>tools, and instruments; they had been able to turn to their profit<br/>the animals, plants, and minerals of the island, that is to say,<br/>the three kingdoms of Nature.<br/><br/>Yes; they often talked of all these things and formed still more<br/>plans.<br/><br/>As to Cyrus Harding he was for the most part silent, and<br/>listened to his companions more often than he spoke to them.<br/>Sometimes he smiled at Herbert's ideas or Pencroft's nonsense, but<br/>always and everywhere he pondered over those inexplicable facts,<br/>that strange enigma, of which the secret still escaped him!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
