"Why not donkeys?" asked Neb.<br/><br/>"Because they have not long ears, and their shape is more<br/>graceful!"<br/><br/>"Donkeys or horses," interrupted Pencroft, "they are 'moving<br/>powers,' as the captain would say, and as such must be<br/>captured!"<br/><br/>The sailor, without frightening the animals, crept through the<br/>grass to the bridge over Creek Glycerine, lowered it, and the<br/>onagers were prisoners.<br/><br/>Now, should they seize them with violence and master them by<br/>force? No. It was decided that for a few days they should be<br/>allowed to roam freely about the plateau, where there was an<br/>abundance of grass, and the engineer immediately began to prepare a<br/>stable near the poultry-yard, in which the onagers might find food,<br/>with a good litter, and shelter during the night.<br/><br/>This done, the movements of the two magnificent creatures were<br/>left entirely free, and the settlers avoided even approaching them<br/>so as to terrify them. Several times, however, the onagers appeared<br/>to wish to leave the plateau, too confined for animals accustomed<br/>to the plains and forests. They were then seen following the<br/>water-barrier which everywhere presented itself before them,<br/>uttering short neighs, then galloping through the grass, and<br/>becoming calmer, they would remain entire hours gazing at the<br/>woods, from which they were cut off for ever!<br/><br/>In the meantime harness of vegetable fiber had been<br/>manufactured, and some days after the capture of the onagers, not<br/>only the cart was ready, but a straight road, or rather a cutting,<br/>had been made through the forests of the Far West, from the angle<br/>of the Mercy to Port Balloon. The cart might then be driven there,<br/>and towards the end of December they tried the onagers for the<br/>first time.<br/><br/>Pencroft had already coaxed the animals to come and eat out of<br/>his hand, and they allowed him to approach without making any<br/>difficulty, but once harnessed they reared and could with<br/>difficulty be held in. However, it was not long before they<br/>submitted to this new service, for the onager, being less<br/>refractory than the zebra, is frequently put in harness in the<br/>mountainous regions of Southern Africa, and it has even been<br/>acclimatized in Europe, under zones of a relative coolness.<br/><br/>On this day all the colony, except Pencroft who walked at the<br/>animals' heads, mounted the cart, and set out on the road to Port<br/>Balloon.<br/><br/>Of course they were jolted over the somewhat rough road, but the<br/>vehicle arrived without any accident, and was soon loaded with the<br/>case and rigging of the balloon.<br/><br/>At eight o'clock that evening the cart, after passing over the<br/>Mercy bridge, descended the left bank of the river, and stopped on<br/>the beach. The onagers being unharnessed, were thence led to their<br/>stable, and Pencroft before going to sleep gave vent to his<br/>feelings in a deep sigh of satisfaction that awoke all the echoes<br/>of Granite House.<br/>
