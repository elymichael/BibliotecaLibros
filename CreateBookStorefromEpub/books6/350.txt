As Cyrus Harding thus enumerated, without forgetting one, the
singular incidents which had occurred in the island, Herbert, Neb,
and Pencroft stared at each other, not knowing what to reply, for
this succession of incidents, grouped thus for the first time,
could not but excite their surprise to the highest degree.

"'Pon my word," said Pencroft at last, "you are right, captain,
and it is difficult to explain all these things!"

"Well, my friends," resumed the engineer, "a last fact has just
been added to these, and it is no less incomprehensible than the
others!"

"What is it, captain?" asked Herbert quickly.

"When you were returning from Tabor Island, Pencroft," continued
the engineer, "you said that a fire appeared on Lincoln
Island?"

"Certainly," answered the sailor.

"And you are quite certain of having seen this fire?"

"As sure as I see you now."

"You also, Herbert?"

"Why, captain," cried Herbert, "that fire was blazing like a
star of the first magnitude!"

"But was it not a star?" urged the engineer.
