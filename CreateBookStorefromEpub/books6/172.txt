"So you think that these people have already quitted the
island?" returned Herbert.

"It is more than probable, my boy; for if their stay was
prolonged, and above all, if they were still here, some accident
would have at last betrayed their presence."

"But if they were able to go away," observed the lad, "they
could not have been castaways."

"No, Herbert; or, at least, they were what might be called
provisional castaways. It is very possible that a storm may have
driven them to the island without destroying their vessel, and
that, the storm over, they went away again."

"I must acknowledge one thing," said Herbert, "it is that
Captain Harding appears rather to fear than desire the presence of
human beings on our island."

"In short," responded the reporter, "there are only Malays who
frequent these seas, and those fellows are ruffians which it is
best to avoid."

"It is not impossible, Mr. Spilett," said Herbert, "that some
day or other we may find traces of their landing."

"I do not say no, my boy. A deserted camp, the ashes of a fire,
would put us on the track, and this is what we will look for in our
next expedition."

The day on which the hunters spoke thus, they were in a part of
the forest near the Mercy, remarkable for its beautiful trees.
There, among others, rose, to a height of nearly 200 feet above the
ground, some of those superb coniferae, to which, in New Zealand,
the natives give the name of Kauris.

"I have an idea, Mr. Spilett," said Herbert. "If I were to climb
to the top of one of these kauris, I could survey the country for
an immense distance round."
