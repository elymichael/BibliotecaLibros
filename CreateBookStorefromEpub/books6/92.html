<br/>The citizens of the Union were at no loss for the right name of<br/>these rodents. They were maras, a sort of agouti, a little larger<br/>than their congeners of tropical countries, regular American<br/>rabbits, with long ears, jaws armed on each side with five molars,<br/>which distinguish the agouti.<br/><br/>"Hurrah!" cried Pencroft, "the roast has arrived! and now we can<br/>go home."<br/><br/>The walk, interrupted for an instant, was resumed. The limpid<br/>waters of the Red Creek flowed under an arch of casuannas,<br/>banksias, and gigantic gum-trees. Superb lilacs rose to a height of<br/>twenty feet. Other arborescent species, unknown to the young<br/>naturalist, bent over the stream, which could be heard murmuring<br/>beneath the bowers of verdure.<br/><br/>Meanwhile the stream grew much wider, and Cyrus Harding supposed<br/>that they would soon reach its mouth. In fact, on emerging from<br/>beneath a thick clump of beautiful trees, it suddenly appeared<br/>before their eyes.<br/><br/>The explorers had arrived on the western shore of Lake Grant.<br/>The place was well worth looking at. This extent of water, of a<br/>circumference of nearly seven miles and an area of two hundred and<br/>fifty acres, reposed in a border of diversified trees. Towards the<br/>east, through a curtain of verdure, picturesquely raised in some<br/>places, sparkled an horizon of sea. The lake was curved at the<br/>north, which contrasted with the sharp outline of its lower part.<br/>Numerous aquatic birds frequented the shores of this little<br/>Ontario, in which the thousand isles of its American namesake were<br/>represented by a rock which emerged from its surface, some hundred<br/>feet from the southern shore. There lived in harmony several<br/>couples of kingfishers perched on a stone, grave, motionless,<br/>watching for fish, then darting down, they plunged in with a sharp<br/>cry, and reappeared with their prey in their beaks. On the shores<br/>and on the islets, strutted wild ducks, pelicans, water-hens,<br/>red-beaks, philedons, furnished with a tongue like a brush, and one<br/>or two specimens of the splendid menura, the tail of which expands<br/>gracefully like a lyre.<br/><br/>As to the water of the lake, it was sweet, limpid, rather dark,<br/>and from certain bubblings, and the concentric circles which<br/>crossed each other on the surface, it could not be doubted that it<br/>abounded in fish.<br/><br/>"This lake is really beautiful!" said Gideon Spilett. "We could<br/>live on its borders!"<br/><br/>"We will live there!" replied Harding.<br/><br/>The settlers, wishing to return to the Chimneys by the shortest<br/>way, descended towards the angle formed on the south by the<br/>junction of the lake's bank. It was not without difficulty that<br/>they broke a path through the thickets and brushwood which had<br/>never been put aside by the hand of mm, and they thus went towards<br/>the shore, so as to arrive at the north of Prospect Heights. Two<br/>miles were cleared in this direction, and then, after they had<br/>passed the last curtain of trees, appeared the plateau, carpeted<br/>with thick turf, and beyond that the infinite sea.<br/><br/>To return to the Chimneys, it was enough to cross the plateau<br/>obliquely for the space of a mile, and then to descend to the elbow<br/>formed by the first detour of the Mercy. But the engineer desired<br/>to know how and where the overplus of the water from the lake<br/>escaped, and the exploration was prolonged under the trees for a<br/>mile and a half towards the north. It was most probable that an<br/>overfall existed somewhere, and doubtless through a cleft in the<br/>granite. This lake was only, in short, an immense center basin,<br/>which was filled by degrees by the creek, and its waters must<br/>necessarily pass to the sea by some fall. If it was so, the<br/>engineer thought that it might perhaps be possible to utilize this<br/>fall and borrow its power, actually lost without profit to any one.<br/>They continued then to follow the shores of Lake Grant by climbing<br/>the plateau; but, after having gone a mile in this direction, Cyrus<br/>Harding had not been able to discover the overfall, which, however,<br/>must exist somewhere.<br/><br/>
