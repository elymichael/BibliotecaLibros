"Yes, that is to be feared!" said the reporter. "Then,
doubtless, the convicts installed themselves in the corral where
they found plenty of everything, and only fled when they saw us
coming. It is very evident, too, that at this moment Ayrton,
whether living or dead, is not here!"

"We shall have to beat the forest," said the engineer, "and rid
the island of these wretches. Pencroft's presentiments were not
mistaken, when he wished to hunt them as wild beasts. That would
have spared us all these misfortunes!"

"Yes," answered the reporter, "but now we have the right to be
merciless!"

"At any rate," said the engineer, "we are obliged to wait some
time, and to remain at the corral until we can carry Herbert
without danger to Granite House."

"But Neb?" asked the reporter.

"Neb is in safety."

"But if, uneasy at our absence, he would venture to come?"

"He must not come!" returned Cyrus Harding quickly. "He would be
murdered on the road!"

"It is very probable, however, that he will attempt to rejoin
us!"

"Ah, if the telegraph still acted, he might be warned! But that
is impossible now! As to leaving Pencroft and Herbert here alone,
we could not do it! Well, I will go alone to Granite House."
