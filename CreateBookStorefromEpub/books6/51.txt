"Go on, Neb," said Spilett.

"I went half crazy when I saw these footprints. They were very
clear and went towards the downs. I followed them for a quarter of
a mile, running, but taking care not to destroy them. Five minutes
after, as it was getting dark, I heard the barking of a dog. It was
Top, and Top brought me here, to my master!"

Neb ended his account by saying what had been his grief at
finding the inanimate body, in which he vainly sought for the least
sign of life. Now that he had found him dead he longed for him to
be alive. All his efforts were useless! Nothing remained to be done
but to render the last duties to the one whom he had loved so much!
Neb then thought of his companions. They, no doubt, would wish to
see the unfortunate man again. Top was there. Could he not rely on
the sagacity of the faithful animal? Neb several times pronounced
the name of the reporter, the one among his companions whom Top
knew best.

Then he pointed to the south, and the dog bounded off in the
direction indicated to him.

We have heard how, guided by an instinct which might be looked
upon almost as supernatural, Top had found them.

Neb's companions had listened with great attention to this
account.

It was unaccountable to them how Cyrus Harding, after the
efforts which he must have made to escape from the waves by
crossing the rocks, had not received even a scratch. And what could
not be explained either was how the engineer had managed to get to
this cave in the downs, more than a mile from the shore.

"So, Neb," said the reporter, "it was not you who brought your
master to this place."

"No, it was not I," replied the Negro.

"It's very clear that the captain came here by himself," said
Pencroft.

"It is clear in reality," observed Spilett, "but it is not
credible!"
