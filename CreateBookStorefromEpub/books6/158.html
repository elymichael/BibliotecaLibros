<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>22<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>This intense cold lasted till the 15th of August, without,<br/>however, passing the degree of Fahrenheit already mentioned. When<br/>the atmosphere was calm, the low temperature was easily borne, but<br/>when the wind blew, the poor settlers, insufficiently clothed, felt<br/>it severely. Pencroft regretted that Lincoln Island was not the<br/>home of a few families of bears rather than of so many foxes and<br/>seals.<br/><br/>"Bears," said he, "are generally very well dressed, and I ask no<br/>more than to borrow for the winter the warm cloaks which they have<br/>on their backs."<br/><br/>"But," replied Neb, laughing, "perhaps the bears would not<br/>consent to give you their cloaks, Pencroft. These beasts are not<br/>St. Martins."<br/><br/>"We would make them do it, Neb, we would make them," replied<br/>Pencroft, in quite an authoritative tone.<br/><br/>But these formidable carnivora did not exist in the island, or<br/>at any rate they had not yet shown themselves.<br/><br/>In the meanwhile, Herbert, Pencroft, and the reporter occupied<br/>themselves with making traps on Prospect Heights and at the border<br/>of the forest.<br/><br/>
