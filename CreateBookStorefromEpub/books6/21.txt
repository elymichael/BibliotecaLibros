All at once the reporter sprang up, and telling the sailor that
he would rejoin them at that same place, he climbed the cliff in
the direction which the Negro Neb had taken a few hours before.
Anxiety hastened his steps, for he longed to obtain news of his
friend, and he soon disappeared round an angle of the cliff.
Herbert wished to accompany him.

"Stop here, my boy," said the sailor; "we have to prepare an
encampment, and to try and find rather better grub than these
shell-fish. Our friends will want something when they come back.
There is work for everybody."

"I am ready," replied Herbert.

"All right," said the sailor; "that will do. We must set about
it regularly. We are tired, cold, and hungry; therefore we must
have shelter, fire, and food. There is wood in the forest, and eggs
in nests; we have only to find a house."

"Very well," returned Herbert, "I will look for a cave among the
rocks, and I shall be sure to discover some hole into which we can
creep."

"All right," said Pencroft; "go on, my boy."
