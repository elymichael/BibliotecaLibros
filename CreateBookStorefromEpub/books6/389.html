<br/>"We shall soon see," rejoined the sailor, "but I would wager my<br/>head there are no rocks in the channel. Look here, captain, to<br/>speak candidly, do you mean to say that there is anything marvelous<br/>in the occurrence?"<br/><br/>Cyrus Harding did not answer.<br/><br/>"At any rate," said Gideon Spilett, "whether rock or explosion,<br/>you will agree, Pencroft, that it occurred just in the nick of<br/>time!"<br/><br/>"Yes! yes!" replied the sailor, "but that is not the question. I<br/>ask Captain Harding if he sees anything supernatural in all<br/>this."<br/><br/>"I cannot say, Pencroft," said the engineer. "That is all the<br/>answer I can make."<br/><br/>A reply which did not satisfy Pencroft at all. He stuck to "an<br/>explosion," and did not wish to give it up. He would never consent<br/>to admit that in that channel, with its fine sandy bed, just like<br/>the beach, which he had often crossed at low water, there could be<br/>an unknown rock.<br/><br/>And besides, at the time the brig foundered, it was high water,<br/>that is to say, there was enough water to carry the vessel clear<br/>over any rocks which would not be uncovered at low tide. Therefore,<br/>there could not have been a collision. Therefore, the vessel had<br/>not struck. So she had blown up.<br/><br/>And it must be confessed that the sailor's arguments were<br/>reasonable.<br/><br/>Towards half-past one, the colonists embarked in the boat to<br/>visit the wreck. It was to be regretted that the brig's two boats<br/>had not been saved; but one, as has been said, had gone to pieces<br/>at the mouth of the Mercy, and was absolutely useless; the other<br/>had disappeared when the brig went down, and had not again been<br/>seen, having doubtless been crushed.<br/><br/>The hull of the "Speedy" was just beginning to issue from the<br/>water. The brig was lying right over on her side, for her masts<br/>being broken, pressed down by the weight of the ballast displaced<br/>by the shock, the keel was visible along her whole length. She had<br/>been regularly turned over by the inexplicable but frightful<br/>submarine action, which had been at the same time manifested by an<br/>enormous water-spout.<br/><br/>
