<br/>"This unfortunate man," observed Gideon Spilett, "was no longer<br/>acquainted with either months or years!"<br/><br/>"Yes!" added Herbert, "and he had been twelve years already on<br/>the islet when we found him there!"<br/><br/>"Twelve years!" rejoined Harding. "Ah! twelve years of solitude,<br/>after a wicked life, perhaps, may well impair a man's reason!"<br/><br/>"I am induced to think," said Pencroft, "that this man was not<br/>wrecked on Tabor Island, but that in consequence of some crime he<br/>was left there."<br/><br/>"You must be right, Pencroft," replied the reporter, "and if it<br/>is so it is not impossible that those who left him on the island<br/>may return to fetch him some day!"<br/><br/>"And they will no longer find him," said Herbert.<br/><br/>"But then," added Pencroft, "they must return, andâ€”"<br/><br/>"My friends," said Cyrus Harding, "do not let us discuss this<br/>question until we know more about it. I believe that the unhappy<br/>man has suffered, that he has severely expiated his faults,<br/>whatever they may have been, and that the wish to unburden himself<br/>stifles him. Do not let us press him to tell us his history! He<br/>will tell it to us doubtless, and when we know it, we shall see<br/>what course it will be best to follow. He alone besides can tell<br/>us, if he has more than a hope, a certainty, of returning some day<br/>to his country, but I doubt it!"<br/><br/>"And why?" asked the reporter.<br/><br/>"Because that, in the event of his being sure of being delivered<br/>at a certain time, he would have waited the hour of his deliverance<br/>and would not have thrown this document into the sea. No, it is<br/>more probable that he was condemned to die on that islet, and that<br/>he never expected to see his fellow-creatures again!"<br/><br/>
