<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>14<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>The next day, the 16th of April, and Easter Sunday, the settlers<br/>issued from the Chimneys at daybreak, and proceeded to wash their<br/>linen. The engineer intended to manufacture soap as soon as he<br/>could procure the necessary materialsâ€”soda or potash, fat or oil.<br/>The important question of renewing their wardrobe would be treated<br/>of in the proper time and place. At any rate their clothes would<br/>last at least six months longer, for they were strong, and could<br/>resist the wear of manual labor. But all would depend on the<br/>situation of the island with regard to inhabited land. This would<br/>be settled to-day if the weather permitted.<br/><br/>The sun rising above a clear horizon, announced a magnificent<br/>day, one of those beautiful autumn days which are like the last<br/>farewells of the warm season.<br/><br/>It was now necessary to complete the observations of the evening<br/>before by measuring the height of the cliff above the level of the<br/>sea.<br/><br/>"Shall you not need an instrument similar to the one which you<br/>used yesterday?" said Herbert to the engineer.<br/><br/>"No, my boy," replied the latter, "we are going to proceed<br/>differently, but in as precise a way."<br/><br/>Herbert, wishing to learn everything he could, followed the<br/>engineer to the beach.
