Gideon Spilett had already several times pondered whether to<br/>throw into the sea a letter enclosed in a bottle, which currents<br/>might perhaps carry to an inhabited coast, or to confide it to<br/>pigeons.<br/><br/>But how could it be seriously hoped that either pigeons or<br/>bottles could cross the distance of twelve hundred miles which<br/>separated the island from any inhabited land? It would have been<br/>pure folly.<br/><br/>But on the 30th of June the capture was effected, not without<br/>difficulty, of an albatross, which a shot from Herbert's gun had<br/>slightly wounded in the foot. It was a magnificent bird, measuring<br/>ten feet from wing to wing, and which could traverse seas as wide<br/>as the Pacific.<br/><br/>Herbert would have liked to keep this superb bird, as its wound<br/>would soon heal, and he thought he could tame it; but Spilett<br/>explained to him that they should not neglect this opportunity of<br/>attempting to communicate by this messenger with the lands of the<br/>Pacific; for if the albatross had come from some inhabited region,<br/>there was no doubt but that it would return there so soon as it was<br/>set free.<br/><br/>Perhaps in his heart Gideon Spilett, in whom the journalist<br/>sometimes came to the surface, was not sorry to have the<br/>opportunity of sending forth to take its chance an exciting article<br/>relating the adventures of the settlers in Lincoln Island. What a<br/>success for the authorized reporter of the New York Herald, and for<br/>the number which should contain the article, if it should ever<br/>reach the address of its editor, the Honorable James Bennett!<br/><br/>Gideon Spilett then wrote out a concise account, which was<br/>placed in a strong waterproof bag, with an earnest request to<br/>whoever might find it to forward it to the office of the New York<br/>Herald. This little bag was fastened to the neck of the albatross,<br/>and not to its foot, for these birds are in the habit of resting on<br/>the surface of the sea; then liberty was given to this swift<br/>courier of the air, and it was not without some emotion that the<br/>colonists watched it disappear in the misty west.<br/><br/>"Where is he going to?" asked Pencroft.<br/><br/>"Towards New Zealand," replied Herbert.<br/><br/>"A good voyage to you," shouted the sailor, who himself did not<br/>expect any great result from this mode of correspondence.<br/><br/>With the winter, work had been resumed in the interior of<br/>Granite House, mending clothes and different occupations, among<br/>others making the sails for their vessel, which were cut from the<br/>inexhaustible balloon-case.<br/><br/>During the month of July the cold was intense, but there was no<br/>lack of either wood or coal. Cyrus Harding had established a second<br/>fireplace in the dining-room, and there the long winter evenings<br/>were spent. Talking while they worked, reading when the hands<br/>remained idle, the time passed with profit to all.<br/>
