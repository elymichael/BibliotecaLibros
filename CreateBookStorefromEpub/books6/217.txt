"It is a joke," said Pencroft; "it is a trick some one has
played us. Well, I don't like such jokes, and the joker had better
look out for himself, if he falls into my hands, I can tell
him."

As soon as the first gleam of light appeared in the east, the
colonists, suitably armed, repaired to the beach under Granite
House. The rising sun now shone on the cliff and they could see the
windows, the shutters of which were closed, through the curtains of
foliage.

All here was in order; but a cry escaped the colonists when they
saw that the door, which they had closed on their departure, was
now wide open.

Some one had entered Granite Houseâ€”there could be no more doubt
about that.

The upper ladder, which generally hung from the door to the
landing, was in its place, but the lower ladder was drawn up and
raised to the threshold. It was evident that the intruders had
wished to guard themselves against a surprise.

Pencroft hailed again.

No reply.

"The beggars," exclaimed the sailor. "There they are sleeping
quietly as if they were in their own house. Hallo there, you
pirates, brigands, robbers, sons of John Bull!"

When Pencroft, being a Yankee, treated any one to the epithet of
"son of John Bull," he considered he had reached the last limits of
insult.

The sun had now completely risen, and the whole facade of
Granite House became illuminated by its rays; but in the interior
as well as on the exterior all was quiet and calm.
