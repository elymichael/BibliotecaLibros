"We must take refuge in Granite House while there is still time,
and the convicts cannot see us."

"That is, my opinion, too," replied Gideon Spilett, "but once
shut upâ€”"

"We must be guided by circumstances," said the engineer.

"Let us be off, then, and make haste!" said the reporter.

"Would you not wish, captain, that Ayrton and I should remain
here?" asked the sailor.

"What would be the use of that, Pencroft?" replied Harding. "No.
We will not separate!"

There was not a moment to be lost. The colonists left the
Chimneys. A bend of the cliff prevented them from being seen by
those in the brig, but two or three reports, and the crash of
bullets on the rock, told them that the "Speedy" was at no great
distance.

To spring into the lift, hoist themselves up to the door of
Granite House, where Top and Jup had been shut up since the evening
before, to rush into the large room, was the work of a minute
only.

It was quite time, for the settlers, through the branches, could
see the "Speedy," surrounded with smoke, gliding up the channel.
The firing was incessant, and shot from the four guns struck
blindly, both on the Mercy post, although it was not occupied, and
on the Chimneys. The rocks were splintered, and cheers accompanied
each discharge. However, they were hoping that Granite House would
be spared, thanks to Harding's precaution of concealing the windows
when a shot, piercing the door, penetrated into the passage.

"We are discovered!" exclaimed Pencroft.
