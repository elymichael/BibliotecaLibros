<br/>"Either the cavern will be completely dry," replied Harding,<br/>"and in that case we can traverse it on foot, or it will not be<br/>dry, and some means of transport will be put at our disposal."<br/><br/>An hour passed. All climbed down through the rain to the level<br/>of the sea. There was now eight feet of the opening above the<br/>water. It was like the arch of a bridge, under which rushed the<br/>foaming water.<br/><br/>Leaning forward, the engineer saw a black object floating on the<br/>water. He drew it towards him. It was a boat, moored to some<br/>interior projection of the cave. This boat was iron-plated. Two<br/>oars lay at the bottom.<br/><br/>"Jump in!" said Harding.<br/><br/>In a moment the settlers were in the boat. Neb and Ayrton took<br/>the oars, Pencroft the rudder. Cyrus Harding in the bows, with the<br/>lantern, lighted the way.<br/><br/>The elliptical roof, under which the boat at first passed,<br/>suddenly rose; but the darkness was too deep, and the light of the<br/>lantern too slight, for either the extent, length, height, or depth<br/>of the cave to be ascertained. Solemn silence reigned in this<br/>basaltic cavern. Not a sound could penetrate into it, even the<br/>thunder peals could not pierce its thick sides.<br/><br/>Such immense caves exist in various parts of the world, natural<br/>crypts dating from the geological epoch of the globe. Some are<br/>filled by the sea; others contain entire lakes in their sides. Such<br/>is Fingal's Cave, in the island of Staffa, one of the Hebrides;<br/>such are the caves of Morgat, in the bay of Douarnenez, in<br/>Brittany, the caves of Bonifacio, in Corsica, those of Lyse-Fjord,<br/>in Norway; such are the immense Mammoth caverns in Kentucky, 500<br/>feet in height, and more than twenty miles in length! In many parts<br/>of the globe, nature has excavated these caverns, and preserved<br/>them for the admiration of man.<br/><br/>Did the cavern which the settlers were now exploring extend to<br/>the center of the island? For a quarter of an hour the boat had<br/>been advancing, making detours, indicated to Pencroft by the<br/>engineer in short sentences, when all at once,â€”<br/><br/>"More to the right!" he commanded.<br/><br/>The boat, altering its course, came up alongside the right wall.<br/>The engineer wished to see if the wire still ran along the<br/>side.<br/><br/>
