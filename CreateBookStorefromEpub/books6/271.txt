The wind blowing out of Union Bay she ran before it, and thus
showed her owners, much to their satisfaction, that she possessed a
remarkably fast pair of heels, according to Pencroft's mode of
speaking. After having doubled Flotsam Point and Claw Cape, the
captain kept her close hauled, so as to sail along the southern
coast of the island, when it was found she sailed admirably within
five points of the wind. All hands were enchanted, they had a good
vessel, which, in case of need, would be of great service to them,
and with fine weather and a fresh breeze the voyage promised to be
charming.

Pencroft now stood off the shore, three or four miles across
from Port Balloon. The island then appeared in all its extent and
under a new aspect, with the varied panorama of its shore from Claw
Cape to Reptile End, the forests in which dark firs contrasted with
the young foliage of other trees and overlooked the whole, and
Mount Franklin whose lofty head was still whitened with snow.

"How beautiful it is!" cried Herbert.

"Yes, our island is beautiful and good," replied Pencroft. "I
love it as I loved my poor mother. It received us poor and
destitute, and now what is wanting to us five fellows who fell on
it from the sky?"

"Nothing," replied Neb; "nothing, captain."

And the two brave men gave three tremendous cheers in honor of
their island!

During all this time Gideon Spilett, leaning against the mast,
sketched the panorama which was developed before his eyes.

Cyrus Harding gazed on it in silence.

"Well, Captain Harding," asked Pencroft, "what do you think of
our vessel?"

"She appears to behave well," replied the engineer.
