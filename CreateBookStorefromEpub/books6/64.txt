"While you were carrying me yesterday, did I not see in the west
a mountain which commands the country?"

"Yes," replied Spilett, "a mountain which must be rather
high—"

"Well," replied the engineer, "we will climb to the summit
to-morrow, and then we shall see if this land is an island or a
continent. Till then, I repeat, there is nothing to be done."

"Yes, fire!" said the obstinate sailor again.

"But he will make us a fire!" replied Gideon Spilett, "only have
a little patience, Pencroft!"

The seaman looked at Spilett in a way which seemed to say, "If
it depended upon you to do it, we wouldn't taste roast meat very
soon"; but he was silent.

Meanwhile Captain Harding had made no reply. He appeared to be
very little troubled by the question of fire. For a few minutes he
remained absorbed in thought; then again speaking,—

"My friends," said he, "our situation is, perhaps, deplorable;
but, at any rate, it is very plain. Either we are on a continent,
and then, at the expense of greater or less fatigue, we shall reach
some inhabited place, or we are on an island. In the latter case,
if the island is inhabited, we will try to get out of the scrape
with the help of its inhabitants; if it is desert, we will try to
get out of the scrape by ourselves."

"Certainly, nothing could be plainer," replied Pencroft.

"But, whether it is an island or a continent," asked Gideon
Spilett, "whereabouts do you think, Cyrus, this storm has thrown
us?"
