"Had you a burning-glass, sir?" asked Herbert of Harding.<br/><br/>"No, my boy," replied he, "but I made one."<br/><br/>And he showed the apparatus which served for a burning-glass. It<br/>was simply two glasses which he had taken from his own and the<br/>reporter's watches. Having filled them with water and rendered<br/>their edges adhesive by means of a little clay, he thus fabricated<br/>a regular burning-glass, which, concentrating the solar rays on<br/>some very dry moss, soon caused it to blaze.<br/><br/>The sailor considered the apparatus; then he gazed at the<br/>engineer without saying a word, only a look plainly expressed his<br/>opinion that if Cyrus Harding was not a magician, he was certainly<br/>no ordinary man. At last speech returned to him, and he cried,â€”<br/><br/>"Note that, Mr. Spilett, note that down on your paper!"<br/><br/>"It is noted," replied the reporter.<br/><br/>Then, Neb helping him, the seaman arranged the spit, and the<br/>capybara, properly cleaned, was soon roasting like a suckling-pig<br/>before a clear, crackling fire.<br/><br/>The Chimneys had again become more habitable, not only because<br/>the passages were warmed by the fire, but because the partitions of<br/>wood and mud had been re-established.<br/><br/>It was evident that the engineer and his companions had employed<br/>their day well. Cyrus Harding had almost entirely recovered his<br/>strength, and had proved it by climbing to the upper plateau. From<br/>this point his eye, accustomed to estimate heights and distances,<br/>was fixed for a long time on the cone, the summit of which he<br/>wished to reach the next day. The mountain, situated about six<br/>miles to the northwest, appeared to him to measure 3,500 feet above<br/>the level of the sea. Consequently the gaze of an observer posted<br/>on its summit would extend over a radius of at least fifty miles.<br/>Therefore it was probable that Harding could easily solve the<br/>question of "island or continent," to which he attached so much<br/>importance.<br/><br/>They supped capitally. The flesh of the capybara was declared<br/>excellent. The sargassum and the almonds of the stone-pine<br/>completed the repast, during which the engineer spoke little. He<br/>was preoccupied with projects for the next day.<br/><br/>Once or twice Pencroft gave forth some ideas upon what it would<br/>be best to do; but Cyrus Harding, who was evidently of a methodical<br/>mind, only shook his head without uttering a word.<br/>
