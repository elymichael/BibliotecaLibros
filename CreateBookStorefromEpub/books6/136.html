"Here is our dwelling," said Cyrus Harding.<br/><br/>"But it was occupied by some creature," replied Gideon Spilett,<br/>whose curiosity was not yet satisfied.<br/><br/>"Well, the creature, amphibious or otherwise, has made off<br/>through this opening," replied the engineer, "and has left the<br/>place for us."<br/><br/>"Never mind," added the sailor, "I should like very much to be<br/>Top just for a quarter of an hour, for he doesn't bark for<br/>nothing!"<br/><br/>Cyrus Harding looked at his dog, and those of his companions who<br/>were near him might have heard him murmur these words,â€”<br/><br/>"Yes, I believe that Top knows more than we do about a great<br/>many things."<br/><br/>However, the wishes of the settlers were for the most part<br/>satisfied. Chance, aided by the marvelous sagacity of their leader,<br/>had done them great service. They had now at their disposal a vast<br/>cavern, the size of which could not be properly calculated by the<br/>feeble light of their torches, but it would certainly be easy to<br/>divide it into rooms, by means of brick partitions, or to use it,<br/>if not as a house, at least as a spacious apartment. The water<br/>which had left it could not return. The place was free.<br/><br/>Two difficulties remained; firstly, the possibility of lighting<br/>this excavation in the midst of solid rock; secondly, the necessity<br/>of rendering the means of access more easy. It was useless to think<br/>of lighting it from above, because of the enormous thickness of the<br/>granite which composed the ceiling; but perhaps the outer wall next<br/>the sea might be pierced. Cyrus Harding, during the descent, had<br/>roughly calculated its obliqueness, and consequently the length of<br/>the passage, and was therefore led to believe that the outer wall<br/>could not be very thick. If light was thus obtained, so would a<br/>means of access, for it would be as easy to pierce a door as<br/>windows, and to establish an exterior ladder.<br/><br/>Harding made known his ideas to his companions.<br/><br/>"Then, captain, let us set to work!" replied Pencroft. "I have<br/>my pickaxe, and I shall soon make my way through this wall. Where<br/>shall I strike?"<br/><br/>"Here," replied the engineer, showing the sturdy sailor a<br/>considerable recess in the side, which would much diminish the<br/>thickness.<br/>
