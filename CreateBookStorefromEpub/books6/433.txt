"Let us go, then!" said he.

The question was quickly decided whether Herbert should be
carried on a litter or in the cart which had brought Ayrton to the
corral. The motion of the litter would have been more easy for the
wounded lad, but it would have necessitated two bearers, that is to
say, there would have been two guns less for defense if an attack
was made on the road. Would they not, on the contrary, by employing
the cart leave every arm free? Was it impossible to place the
mattress on which Herbert was lying in it, and to advance with so
much care that any jolt should be avoided? It could be done.

The cart was brought. Pencroft harnessed the onager. Cyrus
Harding and the reporter raised Herbert's mattress and placed it on
the bottom of the cart. The weather was fine. The sun's bright rays
glanced through the trees.

"Are the guns ready?" asked Cyrus Harding.

They were. The engineer and Pencroft, each armed with a
double-barreled gun, and Gideon Spilett carrying his rifle, had
nothing to do but start.

"Are you comfortable, Herbert?" asked the engineer.

"Ah, captain," replied the lad, "don't be uneasy, I shall not
die on the road!"

While speaking thus, it could be seen that the poor boy had
called up all his energy, and by the energy of a powerful will had
collected his failing strength.

The engineer felt his heart sink painfully. He still hesitated
to give the signal for departure; but that would have driven
Herbert to despairâ€”killed him perhaps.

"Forward!" said Harding.

The gate of the corral was opened. Jup and Top, who knew when to
be silent, ran in advance. The cart came out, the gate was
reclosed, and the onager, led by Pencroft, advanced at a slow
pace.
