"No, because they prevent them!"<br/><br/>"Good. I must note that," said the reporter.<br/><br/>"Note it then, my dear Spilett; for it appears proved that the<br/>presence of the eucalyptus is enough to neutralize miasmas. This<br/>natural antidote has been tried in certain countries in the middle<br/>of Europe and the north of Africa where the soil was absolutely<br/>unhealthy, and the sanitary condition of the inhabitants has been<br/>gradually ameliorated. No more intermittent fevers prevail in the<br/>regions now covered with forests of the myrtaceae. This fact is now<br/>beyond doubt, and it is a happy circumstance for us settlers in<br/>Lincoln Island."<br/><br/>"Ah! what an island! What a blessed island!" cried Pencroft. "I<br/>tell you, it wants nothing—unless it is—"<br/><br/>"That will come, Pencroft, that will be found," replied the<br/>engineer; "but now we must continue our voyage and push on as far<br/>as the river will carry our boat!"<br/><br/>The exploration was therefore continued for another two miles in<br/>the midst of country covered with eucalypti, which predominated in<br/>the woods of this portion of the island. The space which they<br/>occupied extended as far as the eye could reach on each side of the<br/>Mercy, which wound along between high green banks. The bed was<br/>often obstructed by long weeds, and even by pointed rocks, which<br/>rendered the navigation very difficult. The action of the oars was<br/>prevented, and Pencroft was obliged to push with a pole. They found<br/>also that the water was becoming shallower and shallower, and that<br/>the canoe must soon stop. The sun was already sinking towards the<br/>horizon, and the trees threw long shadows on the ground. Cyrus<br/>Harding, seeing that he could not hope to reach the western coast<br/>of the island in one journey, resolved to camp at the place where<br/>any further navigation was prevented by want of water. He<br/>calculated that they were still five or six miles from the coast,<br/>and this distance was too great for them to attempt during the<br/>night in the midst of unknown woods.<br/><br/>The boat was pushed on through the forest, which gradually<br/>became thicker again, and appeared also to have more inhabitants;<br/>for if the eyes of the sailor did not deceive him, he thought he<br/>saw bands of monkeys springing among the trees. Sometimes even two<br/>or three of these animals stopped at a little distance from the<br/>canoe and gazed at the settlers without manifesting any terror, as<br/>if, seeing men for the first time, they had not yet learned to fear<br/>them. It would have been easy to bring down one of these quadramani<br/>with a gunshot, and Pencroft was greatly tempted to fire, but<br/>Harding opposed so useless a massacre. This was prudent, for the<br/>monkeys, or apes rather, appearing to be very powerful and<br/>extremely active, it was useless to provoke an unnecessary<br/>aggression, and the creatures might, ignorant of the power of the<br/>explorers' firearms, have attacked them. It is true that the sailor<br/>considered the monkeys from a purely alimentary point of view, for<br/>those animals which are herbivorous make very excellent game; but<br/>since they had an abundant supply of provisions, it was a pity to<br/>waste their ammunition.<br/><br/>Towards four o'clock, the navigation of the Mercy became<br/>exceedingly difficult, for its course was obstructed by aquatic<br/>plants and rocks. The banks rose higher and higher, and already<br/>they were approaching the spurs of Mount Franklin. The source could<br/>not be far off, since it was fed by the water from the southern<br/>slopes of the mountain.<br/><br/>"In a quarter of an hour," said the sailor, "we shall be obliged<br/>to stop, captain."<br/><br/>"Very well, we will stop, Pencroft, and we will make our<br/>encampment for the night."<br/><br/>"At what distance are we from Granite House?" asked Herbert.<br/>
