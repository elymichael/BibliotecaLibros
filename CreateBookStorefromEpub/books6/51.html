"Go on, Neb," said Spilett.<br/><br/>"I went half crazy when I saw these footprints. They were very<br/>clear and went towards the downs. I followed them for a quarter of<br/>a mile, running, but taking care not to destroy them. Five minutes<br/>after, as it was getting dark, I heard the barking of a dog. It was<br/>Top, and Top brought me here, to my master!"<br/><br/>Neb ended his account by saying what had been his grief at<br/>finding the inanimate body, in which he vainly sought for the least<br/>sign of life. Now that he had found him dead he longed for him to<br/>be alive. All his efforts were useless! Nothing remained to be done<br/>but to render the last duties to the one whom he had loved so much!<br/>Neb then thought of his companions. They, no doubt, would wish to<br/>see the unfortunate man again. Top was there. Could he not rely on<br/>the sagacity of the faithful animal? Neb several times pronounced<br/>the name of the reporter, the one among his companions whom Top<br/>knew best.<br/><br/>Then he pointed to the south, and the dog bounded off in the<br/>direction indicated to him.<br/><br/>We have heard how, guided by an instinct which might be looked<br/>upon almost as supernatural, Top had found them.<br/><br/>Neb's companions had listened with great attention to this<br/>account.<br/><br/>It was unaccountable to them how Cyrus Harding, after the<br/>efforts which he must have made to escape from the waves by<br/>crossing the rocks, had not received even a scratch. And what could<br/>not be explained either was how the engineer had managed to get to<br/>this cave in the downs, more than a mile from the shore.<br/><br/>"So, Neb," said the reporter, "it was not you who brought your<br/>master to this place."<br/><br/>"No, it was not I," replied the Negro.<br/><br/>"It's very clear that the captain came here by himself," said<br/>Pencroft.<br/><br/>"It is clear in reality," observed Spilett, "but it is not<br/>credible!"<br/>
