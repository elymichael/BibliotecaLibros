Between the place occupied by the colonists and the other side<br/>of the immense bay, the shore was composed, first, of a tract of<br/>low land, bordered in the background by trees; then the shore<br/>became more irregular, projecting sharp points into the sea, and<br/>finally ended in the black rocks which, accumulated in picturesque<br/>disorder, formed Claw Cape.<br/><br/>Such was the development of this part of the island, which the<br/>settlers took in at a glance, while stopping for an instant.<br/><br/>"If a vessel ran in here," said Pencroft, "she would certainly<br/>be lost. Sandbanks and reefs everywhere! Bad quarters!"<br/><br/>"But at least something would be left of the ship," observed the<br/>reporter.<br/><br/>"There might be pieces of wood on the rocks, but nothing on the<br/>sands," replied the sailor.<br/><br/>"Why?"<br/><br/>"Because the sands are still more dangerous than the rocks, for<br/>they swallow up everything that is thrown on them. In a few days<br/>the hull of a ship of several hundred tons would disappear entirely<br/>in there!"<br/><br/>"So, Pencroft," asked the engineer, "if a ship has been wrecked<br/>on these banks, is it not astonishing that there is now no trace of<br/>her remaining?"<br/><br/>"No, captain, with the aid of time and tempest. However, it<br/>would be surprising, even in this case, that some of the masts or<br/>spars should not have been thrown on the beach, out of reach of the<br/>waves."<br/><br/>"Let us go on with our search, then," returned Cyrus<br/>Harding.<br/><br/>At one o'clock the colonists arrived at the other side of<br/>Washington Bay, they having now gone a distance of twenty<br/>miles.<br/>
