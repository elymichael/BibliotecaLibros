"That's settled. Let us be off," said the reporter.

Pencroft, Herbert, and Gideon Spilett, on their return to
Granite House, told the engineer all that had passed, and the
latter approved of their arrangements both for the present and the
future. He also promised the sailor that he would study that part
of the channel situated between the islet and the coast, so as to
ascertain if it would not be possible to make an artificial harbor
there by means of dams. In this way, the "Bonadventure" would be
always within reach, under the eyes of the colonists, and if
necessary, under lock and key.

That evening a telegram was sent to Ayrton, requesting him to
bring from the corral a couple of goats, which Neb wished to
acclimatize to the plateau. Singularly enough, Ayrton did not
acknowledge the receipt of the despatch, as he was accustomed to
do. This could not but astonish the engineer. But it might be that
Ayrton was not at that moment in the corral, or even that he was on
his way back to Granite House. In fact, two days had already passed
since his departure, and it had been decided that on the evening of
the 10th or at the latest the morning of the 11th, he should
return. The colonists waited, therefore, for Ayrton to appear on
Prospect Heights. Neb and Herbert even watched at the bridge so as
to be ready to lower it the moment their companion presented
himself.

But up to ten in the evening, there were no signs of Ayrton. It
was, therefore, judged best to send a fresh despatch, requiring an
immediate reply.

The bell of the telegraph at Granite House remained mute.

The colonists' uneasiness was great. What had happened? Was
Ayrton no longer at the corral, or if he was still there, had he no
longer control over his movements? Could they go to the corral in
this dark night?

They consulted. Some wished to go, the others to remain.

"But," said Herbert, "perhaps some accident has happened to the
telegraphic apparatus, so that it works no longer?"

"That may be," said the reporter.

"Wait till to-morrow," replied Cyrus Harding. "It is possible,
indeed, that Ayrton has not received our despatch, or even that we
have not received his."

They waited, of course not without some anxiety.
