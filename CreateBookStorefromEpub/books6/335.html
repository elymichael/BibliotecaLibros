"Or rather it's very like it!" replied Neb.<br/><br/>"But the thermometer marks fifty-eight degrees!" observed Gideon<br/>Spilett.<br/><br/>Cyrus Harding gazed at the sheet of white without saying<br/>anything, for he really did not know how to explain this<br/>phenomenon, at this time of year and in such a temperature.<br/><br/>"By Jove!" exclaimed Pencroft, "all our plants will be<br/>frozen!"<br/><br/>And the sailor was about to descend, when he was preceded by the<br/>nimble Jup, who slid down to the sand.<br/><br/>But the orang had not touched the ground, when the snowy sheet<br/>arose and dispersed in the air in such innumerable flakes that the<br/>light of the sun was obscured for some minutes.<br/><br/>"Birds!" cried Herbert.<br/><br/>They were indeed swarms of sea-birds, with dazzling white<br/>plumage. They had perched by thousands on the islet and on the<br/>shore, and they disappeared in the distance, leaving the colonists<br/>amazed as if they had been present at some transformation scene, in<br/>which summer succeeded winter at the touch of a fairy's wand.<br/>Unfortunately the change had been so sudden, that neither the<br/>reporter nor the lad had been able to bring down one of these<br/>birds, of which they could not recognize the species.<br/><br/>A few days after came the 26th of March, the day on which, two<br/>years before, the castaways from the air had been thrown upon<br/>Lincoln Island.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
