Hope revived in the hearts of the colonists, who had, in this<br/>fourth year of their sojourn on Lincoln island, suffered so many<br/>trials. Even Pencroft lost in some measure the somber taciturnity<br/>occasioned by the devastation and ruin of his domain. His hopes, it<br/>is true, were concentrated upon his vessel.<br/><br/>"We shall finish it," he said to the engineer, "we shall finish<br/>it, captain, and it is time, for the season is advancing and the<br/>equinox will soon be here. Well, if necessary, we must put in to<br/>Tabor island to spend the winter. But think of Tabor island after<br/>Lincoln Island. Ah, how unfortunate! Who could have believed it<br/>possible?"<br/><br/>"Let us get on," was the engineer's invariable reply.<br/><br/>And they worked away without losing a moment.<br/><br/>"Master," asked Neb, a few days later, "do you think all this<br/>could have happened if Captain Nemo had been still alive?"<br/><br/>"Certainly, Neb," answered Cyrus Harding.<br/><br/>"I, for one, don't believe it!" whispered Pencroft to Neb.<br/><br/>"Nor I!" answered Neb seriously.<br/><br/>During the first week of March appearances again became<br/>menacing. Thousands of threads like glass, formed of fluid lava,<br/>fell like rain upon the island. The crater was again boiling with<br/>lava which overflowed the back of the volcano. The torrent flowed<br/>along the surface of the hardened tufa, and destroyed the few<br/>meager skeletons of trees which had withstood the first eruption.<br/>The stream, flowing this time towards the southwest shore of Lake<br/>Grant, stretched beyond Creek Glycerine, and invaded the plateau of<br/>Prospect Heights. This last blow to the work of the colonists was<br/>terrible. The mill, the buildings of the inner court, the stables,<br/>were all destroyed. The affrighted poultry fled in all directions.<br/>Top and Jup showed signs of the greatest alarm, as if their<br/>instinct warned them of an impending catastrophe. A large number of<br/>the animals of the island had perished in the first eruption. Those<br/>which survived found no refuge but Tadorn Marsh, save a few to<br/>which the plateau of Prospect Heights afforded asylum. But even<br/>this last retreat was now closed to them, and the lava- torrent,<br/>flowing over the edge of the granite wall, began to pour down upon<br/>the beach its cataracts of fire. The sublime horror of this<br/>spectacle passed all description. During the night it could only be<br/>compared to a Niagara of molten fluid, with its incandescent vapors<br/>above and its boiling masses below.<br/><br/>The colonists were driven to their last entrenchment, and<br/>although the upper seams of the vessel were not yet calked, they<br/>decided to launch her at once.<br/><br/>Pencroft and Ayrton therefore set about the necessary<br/>preparations for the launching, which was to take place the morning<br/>of the next day, the 9th of March.<br/>
