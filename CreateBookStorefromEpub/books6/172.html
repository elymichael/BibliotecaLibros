<br/>"So you think that these people have already quitted the<br/>island?" returned Herbert.<br/><br/>"It is more than probable, my boy; for if their stay was<br/>prolonged, and above all, if they were still here, some accident<br/>would have at last betrayed their presence."<br/><br/>"But if they were able to go away," observed the lad, "they<br/>could not have been castaways."<br/><br/>"No, Herbert; or, at least, they were what might be called<br/>provisional castaways. It is very possible that a storm may have<br/>driven them to the island without destroying their vessel, and<br/>that, the storm over, they went away again."<br/><br/>"I must acknowledge one thing," said Herbert, "it is that<br/>Captain Harding appears rather to fear than desire the presence of<br/>human beings on our island."<br/><br/>"In short," responded the reporter, "there are only Malays who<br/>frequent these seas, and those fellows are ruffians which it is<br/>best to avoid."<br/><br/>"It is not impossible, Mr. Spilett," said Herbert, "that some<br/>day or other we may find traces of their landing."<br/><br/>"I do not say no, my boy. A deserted camp, the ashes of a fire,<br/>would put us on the track, and this is what we will look for in our<br/>next expedition."<br/><br/>The day on which the hunters spoke thus, they were in a part of<br/>the forest near the Mercy, remarkable for its beautiful trees.<br/>There, among others, rose, to a height of nearly 200 feet above the<br/>ground, some of those superb coniferae, to which, in New Zealand,<br/>the natives give the name of Kauris.<br/><br/>"I have an idea, Mr. Spilett," said Herbert. "If I were to climb<br/>to the top of one of these kauris, I could survey the country for<br/>an immense distance round."<br/><br/>
