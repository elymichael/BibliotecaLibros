<br/>"Just as you please. I wash my hands of you," was Amy's short<br/>answer.<br/><br/>"Then I'll enjoy myself. The boys are at home, and we'll have a<br/>comfortable time. Goodness knows I need a little change, for<br/>elegance has a bad effect upon my constitution," returned Jo<br/>gruffly, being disturbed by her failure to suit.<br/><br/>An enthusiastic welcome from three big boys and several pretty<br/>children speedily soothed her ruffled feelings, and leaving Amy to<br/>entertain the hostess and Mr. Tudor, who happened to be calling<br/>likewise, Jo devoted herself to the young folks and found the<br/>change refreshing. She listened to college stories with deep<br/>interest, caressed pointers and poodles without a murmur, agreed<br/>heartily that "Tom Brown was a brick," regardless of the improper<br/>form of praise, and when one lad proposed a visit to his turtle<br/>tank, she went with an alacrity which caused Mamma to smile upon<br/>her, as that motherly lady settled the cap which was left in a<br/>ruinous condition by filial hugs, bearlike but affectionate, and<br/>dearer to her than the most faultless coiffure from the hands of an<br/>inspired Frenchwoman.<br/><br/>Leaving her sister to her own devices, Amy proceeded to enjoy<br/>herself to her heart's content. Mr. Tudor's uncle had married an<br/>English lady who was third cousin to a living lord, and Amy<br/>regarded the whole family with great respect, for in spite of her<br/>American birth and breeding, she possessed that reverence for<br/>titles which haunts the best of usâ€”that unacknowledged loyalty to<br/>the early faith in kings which set the most democratic nation under<br/>the sun in ferment at the coming of a royal yellow-haired laddie,<br/>some years ago, and which still has something to do with the love<br/>the young country bears the old, like that of a big son for an<br/>imperious little mother, who held him while she could, and let him<br/>go with a farewell scolding when he rebelled. But even the<br/>satisfaction of talking with a distant connection of the British<br/>nobility did not render Amy forgetful of time, and when the proper<br/>number of minutes had passed, she reluctantly tore herself from<br/>this aristocratic society, and looked about for Jo, fervently<br/>hoping that her incorrigible sister would not be found in any<br/>position which should bring disgrace upon the name of March.<br/><br/>It might have been worse, but Amy considered it bad. For Jo sat<br/>on the grass, with an encampment of boys about her, and a<br/>dirty-footed dog reposing on the skirt of her state and festival<br/>dress, as she related one of Laurie's pranks to her admiring<br/>audience. One small child was poking turtles with Amy's cherished<br/>parasol, a second was eating gingerbread over Jo's best bonnet, and<br/>a third playing ball with her gloves, but all were enjoying<br/>themselves, and when Jo collected her damaged property to go, her<br/>escort accompanied her, begging her to come again, "It was such fun<br/>to hear about Laurie's larks."<br/><br/>"Capital boys, aren't they? I feel quite young and brisk again<br/>after that." said Jo, strolling along with her hands behind her,<br/>partly from habit, partly to conceal the bespattered parasol.<br/><br/>"Why do you always avoid Mr. Tudor?" asked Amy, wisely<br/>refraining from any comment upon Jo's dilapidated appearance.<br/><br/>"Don't like him, he puts on airs, snubs his sisters, worries his<br/>father, and doesn't speak respectfully of his mother. Laurie says<br/>he is fast, and I don't consider him a desirable acquaintance, so I<br/>let him alone."<br/><br/>"You might treat him civilly, at least. You gave him a cool nod,<br/>and just now you bowed and smiled in the politest way to Tommy<br/>Chamberlain, whose father keeps a grocery store. If you had just<br/>reversed the nod and the bow, it would have been right," said Amy<br/>reprovingly.<br/><br/>"No, it wouldn't," returned Jo, "I neither like, respect, nor<br/>admire Tudor, though his grandfather's uncle's nephew's niece was a<br/>third cousin to a lord. Tommy is poor and bashful and good and very<br/>clever. I think well of him, and like to show that I do, for he is<br/>a gentleman in spite of the brown paper parcels."<br/><br/>
