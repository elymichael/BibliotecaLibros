<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>5<br/>Domestic Experiences<br/><br/><br/>Like most other young matrons, Meg began her married life with<br/>the determination to be a model housekeeper. John should find home<br/>a paradise, he should always see a smiling face, should fare<br/>sumptuously every day, and never know the loss of a button. She<br/>brought so much love, energy, and cheerfulness to the work that she<br/>could not but succeed, in spite of some obstacles. Her paradise was<br/>not a tranquil one, for the little woman fussed, was over-anxious<br/>to please, and bustled about like a true Martha, cumbered with many<br/>cares. She was too tired, sometimes, even to smile, John grew<br/>dyspeptic after a course of dainty dishes and ungratefully demanded<br/>plain fare. As for buttons, she soon learned to wonder where they<br/>went, to shake her head over the carelessness of men, and to<br/>threaten to make him sew them on himself, and see if his work would<br/>stand impatient and clumsy fingers any better than hers.<br/><br/>They were very happy, even after they discovered that they<br/>couldn't live on love alone. John did not find Meg's beauty<br/>diminished, though she beamed at him from behind the familiar<br/>coffee pot. Nor did Meg miss any of the romance from the daily<br/>parting, when her husband followed up his kiss with the tender<br/>inquiry, "Shall I send some veal or mutton for dinner, darling?"<br/>The little house ceased to be a glorified bower, but it became a<br/>home, and the young couple soon felt that it was a change for the<br/>better. At first they played keep-house, and frolicked over it like<br/>children. Then John took steadily to business, feeling the cares of<br/>the head of a family upon his shoulders, and Meg laid by her<br/>cambric wrappers, put on a big apron, and fell to work, as before<br/>said, with more energy than discretion.<br/><br/>While the cooking mania lasted she went through Mrs. Cornelius's<br/>Receipt Book as if it were a mathematical exercise, working out the<br/>problems with patience and care. Sometimes her family were invited<br/>in to help eat up a too bounteous feast of successes, or Lotty<br/>would be privately dispatched with a batch of failures, which were<br/>to be concealed from all eyes in the convenient stomachs of the<br/>little Hummels. An evening with John over the account books usually<br/>produced a temporary lull in the culinary enthusiasm, and a frugal<br/>fit would ensue, during which the poor man was put through a course<br/>of bread pudding, hash, and warmed-over coffee, which tried his<br/>soul, although he bore it with praiseworthy fortitude. Before the<br/>golden mean was found, however, Meg added to her domestic<br/>possessions what young couples seldom get on long without, a family<br/>jar.<br/><br/>Fired a with housewifely wish to see her storeroom stocked with<br/>homemade preserves, she undertook to put up her own currant jelly.<br/>John was requested to order home a dozen or so of little pots and<br/>an extra quantity of sugar, for their own currants were ripe and<br/>were to be attended to at once. As John firmly believed that 'my<br/>wife' was equal to anything, and took a natural pride in her skill,<br/>he resolved that she should be gratified, and their only crop of<br/>fruit laid by in a most pleasing form for winter use. Home came<br/>four dozen delightful little pots, half a barrel of sugar, and a<br/>small boy to pick the currants for her. With her pretty hair tucked<br/>into a little cap, arms bared to the elbow, and a checked apron<br/>which had a coquettish look in spite of the bib, the young<br/>housewife fell to work, feeling no doubts about her success, for<br/>hadn't she seen Hannah do it hundreds of times? The array of pots<br/>rather amazed her at first, but John was so fond of jelly, and the<br/>nice little jars would look so well on the top shelf, that Meg<br/>resolved to fill them all, and spent a long day picking, boiling,<br/>straining, and fussing over her jelly. She did her best, she asked<br/>advice of Mrs. Cornelius, she racked her brain to remember what<br/>Hannah did that she left undone, she reboiled, resugared, and<br/>restrained, but that dreadful stuff wouldn't 'jell'.<br/><br/>She longed to run home, bib and all, and ask Mother to lend her<br/>a hand, but John and she had agreed that they would never annoy<br/>anyone with their private worries, experiments, or quarrels. They<br/>had laughed over that last word as if the idea it suggested was a<br/>most preposterous one, but they had held to their resolve, and<br/>whenever they could get on without help they did so, and no one<br/>interfered, for Mrs. March had advised the plan. So Meg wrestled<br/>alone with the refractory sweetmeats all that hot summer day, and<br/>at five o'clock sat down in her topsy-turvey kitchen, wrung her<br/>bedaubed hands, lifted up her voice and wept.<br/><br/>Now, in the first flush of the new life, she had often said, "My<br/>husband shall always feel free to bring a friend home whenever he<br/>likes. I shall always be prepared. There shall be no flurry, no<br/>scolding, no discomfort, but a neat house, a cheerful wife, and a<br/>good dinner. John, dear, never stop to ask my leave, invite whom<br/>you please, and be sure of a welcome from me."<br/><br/>How charming that was, to be sure! John quite glowed with pride<br/>to hear her say it, and felt what a blessed thing it was to have a<br/>superior wife. But, although they had had company from time to<br/>time, it never happened to be unexpected, and Meg had never had an<br/>opportunity to distinguish herself till now. It always happens so<br/>in this vale of tears, there is an inevitability about such things<br/>which we can only wonder at, deplore, and bear as we best can.<br/>
