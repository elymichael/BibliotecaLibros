<br/>"Prime, isn't it?" asked the boy, as her eye went down the last<br/>paragraph of her portion.<br/><br/>"I think you and I could do as well as that if we tried,"<br/>returned Jo, amused at his admiration of the trash.<br/><br/>"I should think I was a pretty lucky chap if I could. She makes<br/>a good living out of such stories, they say." and he pointed to the<br/>name of Mrs. S.L.A.N.G. Northbury, under the title of the tale.<br/><br/>"Do you know her?" asked Jo, with sudden interest.<br/><br/>"No, but I read all her pieces, and I know a fellow who works in<br/>the office where this paper is printed."<br/><br/>"Do you say she makes a good living out of stories like this?"<br/>and Jo looked more respectfully at the agitated group and thickly<br/>sprinkled exclamation points that adorned the page.<br/><br/>"Guess she does! She knows just what folks like, and gets paid<br/>well for writing it."<br/><br/>Here the lecture began, but Jo heard very little of it, for<br/>while Professor Sands was prosing away about Belzoni, Cheops,<br/>scarabei, and hieroglyphics, she was covertly taking down the<br/>address of the paper, and boldly resolving to try for the<br/>hundred-dollar prize offered in its columns for a sensational<br/>story. By the time the lecture ended and the audience awoke, she<br/>had built up a splendid fortune for herself (not the first founded<br/>on paper), and was already deep in the concoction of her story,<br/>being unable to decide whether the duel should come before the<br/>elopement or after the murder.<br/><br/>She said nothing of her plan at home, but fell to work next day,<br/>much to the disquiet of her mother, who always looked a little<br/>anxious when 'genius took to burning'. Jo had never tried this<br/>style before, contenting herself with very mild romances<br/>for&#160;<br/>The Spread Eagle<br/>. Her experience and<br/>miscellaneous reading were of service now, for they gave her some<br/>idea of dramatic effect, and supplied plot, language, and costumes.<br/>Her story was as full of desperation and despair as her limited<br/>acquaintance with those uncomfortable emotions enabled her to make<br/>it, and having located it in Lisbon, she wound up with an<br/>earthquake, as a striking and appropriate denouement. The<br/>manuscript was privately dispatched, accompanied by a note,<br/>modestly saying that if the tale didn't get the prize, which the<br/>writer hardly dared expect, she would be very glad to receive any<br/>sum it might be considered worth.<br/><br/>
