<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>15<br/>A<br/>Telegram<br/><br/><br/>"November is the most disagreeable month in the whole year,"<br/>said Margaret, standing at the window one dull afternoon, looking<br/>out at the frostbitten garden.<br/><br/>"That's the reason I was born in it," observed Jo pensively,<br/>quite unconscious of the blot on her nose.<br/><br/>"If something very pleasant should happen now, we should think<br/>it a delightful month," said Beth, who took a hopeful view of<br/>everything, even November.<br/><br/>"I dare say, but nothing pleasant ever does happen in this<br/>family," said Meg, who was out of sorts. "We go grubbing along day<br/>after day, without a bit of change, and very little fun. We might<br/>as well be in a treadmill."<br/><br/>"My patience, how blue we are!" cried Jo. "I don't much wonder,<br/>poor dear, for you see other girls having splendid times, while you<br/>grind, grind, year in and year out. Oh, don't I wish I could manage<br/>things for you as I do for my heroines! You're pretty enough and<br/>good enough already, so I'd have some rich relation leave you a<br/>fortune unexpectedly. Then you'd dash out as an heiress, scorn<br/>everyone who has slighted you, go abroad, and come home my Lady<br/>Something in a blaze of splendor and elegance."<br/><br/>"People don't have fortunes left them in that style nowadays,<br/>men have to work and women marry for money. It's a dreadfully<br/>unjust world," said Meg bitterly.<br/><br/>"Jo and I are going to make fortunes for you all. Just wait ten<br/>years, and see if we don't," said Amy, who sat in a corner making<br/>mud pies, as Hannah called her little clay models of birds, fruit,<br/>and faces.<br/>
