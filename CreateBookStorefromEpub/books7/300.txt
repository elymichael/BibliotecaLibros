Next week we are off to Germany and Switzerland,
and as we shall travel fast, I shall only be able to give you hasty
letters. I keep my diary, and try to 'remember correctly and
describe clearly all that I see and admire', as Father advised. It
is good practice for me, and with my sketchbook will give you a
better idea of my tour than these scribbles.

Adieu, I embrace you tenderly.&#160;
"Votre
Amie."

HEIDELBERG

My dear Mamma,

Having a quiet hour before we leave for Berne,
I'll try to tell you what has happened, for some of it is very
important, as you will see.

The sail up the Rhine was perfect, and I just sat
and enjoyed it with all my might. Get Father's old guidebooks and
read about it. I haven't words beautiful enough to describe it. At
Coblentz we had a lovely time, for some students from Bonn, with
whom Fred got acquainted on the boat, gave us a serenade. It was a
moonlight night, and about one o'clock Flo and I were waked by the
most delicious music under our windows. We flew up, and hid behind
the curtains, but sly peeps showed us Fred and the students singing
away down below. It was the most romantic thing I ever saw—the
river, the bridge of boats, the great fortress opposite, moonlight
everywhere, and music fit to melt a heart of stone.

When they were done we threw down some flowers,
and saw them scramble for them, kiss their hands to the invisible
ladies, and go laughing away, to smoke and drink beer, I suppose.
Next morning Fred showed me one of the crumpled flowers in his vest
pocket, and looked very sentimental. I laughed at him, and said I
didn't throw it, but Flo, which seemed to disgust him, for he
tossed it out of the window, and turned sensible again. I'm afraid
I'm going to have trouble with that boy, it begins to look like
it.

The baths at Nassau were very gay, so was
Baden-Baden, where Fred lost some money, and I scolded him. He
needs someone to look after him when Frank is not with him. Kate
said once she hoped he'd marry soon, and I quite agree with her
that it would be well for him. Frankfurt was delightful. I saw
Goethe's house, Schiller's statue, and Dannecker's famous
'Ariadne.' It was very lovely, but I should have enjoyed it more if
I had known the story better. I didn't like to ask, as everyone
knew it or pretended they did. I wish Jo would tell me all about
it. I ought to have read more, for I find I don't know anything,
and it mortifies me.

Now comes the serious part, for it happened here,
and Fred has just gone. He has been so kind and jolly that we all
got quite fond of him. I never thought of anything but a traveling
friendship till the serenade night. Since then I've begun to feel
that the moonlight walks, balcony talks, and daily adventures were
something more to him than fun. I haven't flirted, Mother, truly,
but remembered what you said to me, and have done my very best. I
can't help it if people like me. I don't try to make them, and it
worries me if I don't care for them, though Jo says I haven't got
any heart. Now I know Mother will shake her head, and the girls
say, "Oh, the mercenary little wretch!", but I've made up my mind,
and if Fred asks me, I shall accept him, though I'm not madly in
love. I like him, and we get on comfortably together. He is
handsome, young, clever enough, and very rich—ever so much richer
than the Laurences. I don't think his family would object, and I
should be very happy, for they are all kind, well-bred, generous
people, and they like me. Fred, as the eldest twin, will have the
estate, I suppose, and such a splendid one it is! A city house in a
fashionable street, not so showy as our big houses, but twice as
comfortable and full of solid luxury, such as English people
believe in. I like it, for it's genuine. I've seen the plate, the
family jewels, the old servants, and pictures of the country place,
with its park, great house, lovely grounds, and fine horses. Oh, it
would be all I should ask! And I'd rather have it than any title
such as girls snap up so readily, and find nothing behind. I may be
mercenary, but I hate poverty, and don't mean to bear it a minute
longer than I can help. One of us&#160;
