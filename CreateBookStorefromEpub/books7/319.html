I'm so fond of writing, I should go spinning on<br/>forever if motives of economy didn't stop me, for though I've used<br/>thin paper and written fine, I tremble to think of the stamps this<br/>long letter will need. Pray forward Amy's as soon as you can spare<br/>them. My small news will sound very flat after her splendors, but<br/>you will like them, I know. Is Teddy studying so hard that he can't<br/>find time to write to his friends? Take good care of him for me,<br/>Beth, and tell me all about the babies, and give heaps of love to<br/>everyone. From your faithful Jo.<br/><br/>P.S. On reading over my letter, it strikes me as<br/>rather Bhaery, but I am always interested in odd people, and I<br/>really had nothing else to write about. Bless you!<br/><br/>DECEMBER<br/><br/>My Precious Betsey,<br/><br/>As this is to be a scribble-scrabble letter, I<br/>direct it to you, for it may amuse you, and give you some idea of<br/>my goings on, for though quiet, they are rather amusing, for which,<br/>oh, be joyful! After what Amy would call Herculaneum efforts, in<br/>the way of mental and moral agriculture, my young ideas begin to<br/>shoot and my little twigs to bend as I could wish. They are not so<br/>interesting to me as Tina and the boys, but I do my duty by them,<br/>and they are fond of me. Franz and Emil are jolly little lads,<br/>quite after my own heart, for the mixture of German and American<br/>spirit in them produces a constant state of effervescence. Saturday<br/>afternoons are riotous times, whether spent in the house or out,<br/>for on pleasant days they all go to walk, like a seminary, with the<br/>Professor and myself to keep order, and then such fun!<br/><br/>We are very good friends now, and I've begun to<br/>take lessons. I really couldn't help it, and it all came about in<br/>such a droll way that I must tell you. To begin at the beginning,<br/>Mrs. Kirke called to me one day as I passed Mr. Bhaer's room where<br/>she was rummaging.<br/><br/>"Did you ever see such a den, my dear? Just come<br/>and help me put these books to rights, for I've turned everything<br/>upside down, trying to discover what he has done with the six new<br/>handkerchiefs I gave him not long ago."<br/><br/>I went in, and while we worked I looked about me,<br/>for it was 'a den' to be sure. Books and papers everywhere, a<br/>broken meerschaum, and an old flute over the mantlepiece as if done<br/>with, a ragged bird without any tail chirped on one window seat,<br/>and a box of white mice adorned the other. Half-finished boats and<br/>bits of string lay among the manuscripts. Dirty little boots stood<br/>drying before the fire, and traces of the dearly beloved boys, for<br/>whom he makes a slave of himself, were to be seen all over the<br/>room. After a grand rummage three of the missing articles were<br/>found, one over the bird cage, one covered with ink, and a third<br/>burned brown, having been used as a holder.<br/><br/>"Such a man!" laughed good-natured Mrs. K., as<br/>she put the relics in the rag bay. "I suppose the others are torn<br/>up to rig ships, bandage cut fingers, or make kite tails. It's<br/>dreadful, but I can't scold him. He's so absent-minded and<br/>goodnatured, he lets those boys ride over him roughshod. I agreed<br/>to do his washing and mending, but he forgets to give out his<br/>things and I forget to look them over, so he comes to a sad pass<br/>sometimes."<br/><br/>"Let me mend them," said I. "I don't mind it, and<br/>he needn't know. I'd like to, he's so kind to me about bringing my<br/>letters and lending books."<br/><br/>So I have got his things in order, and knit heels<br/>into two pairs of the socks, for they were boggled out of shape<br/>with his queer darns. Nothing was said, and I hoped he wouldn't<br/>find it out, but one day last week he caught me at it. Hearing the<br/>lessons he gives to others has interested and amused me so much<br/>that I took a fancy to learn, for Tina runs in and out, leaving the<br/>door open, and I can hear. I had been sitting near this door,<br/>finishing off the last sock, and trying to understand what he said<br/>to a new scholar, who is as stupid as I am. The girl had gone, and<br/>I thought he had also, it was so still, and I was busily gabbling<br/>over a verb, and rocking to and fro in a most absurd way, when a<br/>little crow made me look up, and there was Mr. Bhaer looking and<br/>laughing quietly, while he made signs to Tina not to betray<br/>him.<br/>
