A universal shriek arose as the russet boots waved wildly from<br/>the wreck and a golden head emerged, exclaiming, "I told you so! I<br/>told you so!" With wonderful presence of mind, Don Pedro, the cruel<br/>sire, rushed in, dragged out his daughter, with a hasty asideâ€¦<br/><br/>"Don't laugh! Act as if it was all right!" and, ordering<br/>Roderigo up, banished him from the kingdom with wrath and scorn.<br/>Though decidedly shaken by the fall from the tower upon him,<br/>Roderigo defied the old gentleman and refused to stir. This<br/>dauntless example fired Zara. She also defied her sire, and he<br/>ordered them both to the deepest dungeons of the castle. A stout<br/>little retainer came in with chains and led them away, looking very<br/>much frightened and evidently forgetting the speech he ought to<br/>have made.<br/><br/>Act third was the castle hall, and here Hagar appeared, having<br/>come to free the lovers and finish Hugo. She hears him coming and<br/>hides, sees him put the potions into two cups of wine and bid the<br/>timid little servant, "Bear them to the captives in their cells,<br/>and tell them I shall come anon." The servant takes Hugo aside to<br/>tell him something, and Hagar changes the cups for two others which<br/>are harmless. Ferdinando, the 'minion', carries them away, and<br/>Hagar puts back the cup which holds the poison meant for Roderigo.<br/>Hugo, getting thirsty after a long warble, drinks it, loses his<br/>wits, and after a good deal of clutching and stamping, falls flat<br/>and dies, while Hagar informs him what she has done in a song of<br/>exquisite power and melody.<br/><br/>This was a truly thrilling scene, though some persons might have<br/>thought that the sudden tumbling down of a quantity of long red<br/>hair rather marred the effect of the villain's death. He was called<br/>before the curtain, and with great propriety appeared, leading<br/>Hagar, whose singing was considered more wonderful than all the<br/>rest of the performance put together.<br/><br/>Act fourth displayed the despairing Roderigo on the point of<br/>stabbing himself because he has been told that Zara has deserted<br/>him. Just as the dagger is at his heart, a lovely song is sung<br/>under his window, informing him that Zara is true but in danger,<br/>and he can save her if he will. A key is thrown in, which unlocks<br/>the door, and in a spasm of rapture he tears off his chains and<br/>rushes away to find and rescue his lady love.<br/><br/>Act fifth opened with a stormy scene between Zara and Don Pedro.<br/>He wishes her to go into a convent, but she won't hear of it, and<br/>after a touching appeal, is about to faint when Roderigo dashes in<br/>and demands her hand. Don Pedro refuses, because he is not rich.<br/>They shout and gesticulate tremendously but cannot agree, and<br/>Rodrigo is about to bear away the exhausted Zara, when the timid<br/>servant enters with a letter and a bag from Hagar, who has<br/>mysteriously disappeared. The latter informs the party that she<br/>bequeaths untold wealth to the young pair and an awful doom to Don<br/>Pedro, if he doesn't make them happy. The bag is opened, and<br/>several quarts of tin money shower down upon the stage till it is<br/>quite glorified with the glitter. This entirely softens the stern<br/>sire. He consents without a murmur, all join in a joyful chorus,<br/>and the curtain falls upon the lovers kneeling to receive Don<br/>Pedro's blessing in attitudes of the most romantic grace.<br/><br/>Tumultuous applause followed but received an unexpected check,<br/>for the cot bed, on which the dress circle was built, suddenly shut<br/>up and extinguished the enthusiastic audience. Roderigo and Don<br/>Pedro flew to the rescue, and all were taken out unhurt, though<br/>many were speechless with laughter. The excitement had hardly<br/>subsided when Hannah appeared, with "Mrs. March's compliments, and<br/>would the ladies walk down to supper."<br/><br/>This was a surprise even to the actors, and when they saw the<br/>table, they looked at one another in rapturous amazement. It was<br/>like Marmee to get up a little treat for them, but anything so fine<br/>as this was unheard of since the departed days of plenty. There was<br/>ice cream, actually two dishes of it, pink and white, and cake and<br/>fruit and distracting French bonbons and, in the middle of the<br/>table, four great bouquets of hot house flowers.<br/><br/>It quite took their breath away, and they stared first at the<br/>table and then at their mother, who looked as if she enjoyed it<br/>immensely.<br/><br/>"Is it fairies?" asked Amy.<br/><br/>"Santa Claus," said Beth.<br/>
