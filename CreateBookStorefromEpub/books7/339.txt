"Well, sir, what is it?" and Laurie sat down, without a sign of
interest in face or voice.

"There is business in London that needs looking after. I meant
you should attend to it, but I can do it better myself, and things
here will get on very well with Brooke to manage them. My partners
do almost everything, I'm merely holding on until you take my
place, and can be off at any time."

"But you hate traveling, Sir. I can't ask it of you at your
age," began Laurie, who was grateful for the sacrifice, but much
preferred to go alone, if he went at all.

The old gentleman knew that perfectly well, and particularly
desired to prevent it, for the mood in which he found his grandson
assured him that it would not be wise to leave him to his own
devices. So, stifling a natural regret at the thought of the home
comforts he would leave behind him, he said stoutly, "Bless your
soul, I'm not superannuated yet. I quite enjoy the idea. It will do
me good, and my old bones won't suffer, for traveling nowadays is
almost as easy as sitting in a chair."

A restless movement from Laurie suggested that his chair was not
easy, or that he did not like the plan, and made the old man add
hastily, "I don't mean to be a marplot or a burden. I go because I
think you'd feel happier than if I was left behind. I don't intend
to gad about with you, but leave you free to go where you like,
while I amuse myself in my own way. I've friends in London and
Paris, and should like to visit them. Meantime you can go to Italy,
Germany, Switzerland, where you will, and enjoy pictures, music,
scenery, and adventures to your heart's content."

Now, Laurie felt just then that his heart was entirely broken
and the world a howling wilderness, but at the sound of certain
words which the old gentleman artfully introduced into his closing
sentence, the broken heart gave an unexpected leap, and a green
oasis or two suddenly appeared in the howling wilderness. He
sighed, and then said, in a spiritless tone, "Just as you like,
Sir. It doesn't matter where I go or what I do."

"It does to me, remember that, my lad. I give you entire
liberty, but I trust you to make an honest use of it. Promise me
that, Laurie."

"Anything you like, Sir."

"Good," thought the old gentleman. "You don't care now, but
there'll come a time when that promise will keep you out of
mischief, or I'm much mistaken."

Being an energetic individual, Mr. Laurence struck while the
iron was hot, and before the blighted being recovered spirit enough
to rebel, they were off. During the time necessary for preparation,
Laurie bore himself as young gentleman usually do in such cases. He
was moody, irritable, and pensive by turns, lost his appetite,
neglected his dress and devoted much time to playing tempestuously
on his piano, avoided Jo, but consoled himself by staring at her
from his window, with a tragic face that haunted her dreams by
night and oppressed her with a heavy sense of guilt by day. Unlike
some sufferers, he never spoke of his unrequited passion, and would
allow no one, not even Mrs. March, to attempt consolation or offer
sympathy. On some accounts, this was a relief to his friends, but
the weeks before his departure were very uncomfortable, and
everyone rejoiced that the 'poor, dear fellow was going away to
forget his trouble, and come home happy'. Of course, he smiled
darkly at their delusion, but passed it by with the sad superiority
of one who knew that his fidelity like his love was
unalterable.

When the parting came he affected high spirits, to conceal
certain inconvenient emotions which seemed inclined to assert
themselves. This gaiety did not impose upon anybody, but they tried
to look as if it did for his sake, and he got on very well till
Mrs. March kissed him, with a whisper full of motherly solicitude.
Then feeling that he was going very fast, he hastily embraced them
all round, not forgetting the afflicted Hannah, and ran downstairs
as if for his life. Jo followed a minute after to wave her hand to
him if he looked round. He did look round, came back, put his arms
about her as she stood on the step above him, and looked up at her
with a face that made his short appeal eloquent and pathetic.
