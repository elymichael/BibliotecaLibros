"We are not strangers, we are neighbors, and you needn't think
you'd be a bother. We want to know you, and I've been trying to do
it this ever so long. We haven't been here a great while, you know,
but we have got acquainted with all our neighbors but you."

"You see, Grandpa lives among his books, and doesn't mind much
what happens outside. Mr. Brooke, my tutor, doesn't stay here, you
know, and I have no one to go about with me, so I just stop at home
and get on as I can."

"That's bad. You ought to make an effort and go visiting
everywhere you are asked, then you'll have plenty of friends, and
pleasant places to go to. Never mind being bashful. It won't last
long if you keep going."

Laurie turned red again, but wasn't offended at being accused of
bashfulness, for there was so much good will in Jo it was
impossible not to take her blunt speeches as kindly as they were
meant.

"Do you like your school?" asked the boy, changing the subject,
after a little pause, during which he stared at the fire and Jo
looked about her, well pleased.

"Don't go to school, I'm a businessmanâ€”girl, I mean. I go to
wait on my great-aunt, and a dear, cross old soul she is, too,"
answered Jo.

Laurie opened his mouth to ask another question, but remembering
just in time that it wasn't manners to make too many inquiries into
people's affairs, he shut it again, and looked uncomfortable.

Jo liked his good breeding, and didn't mind having a laugh at
Aunt March, so she gave him a lively description of the fidgety old
lady, her fat poodle, the parrot that talked Spanish, and the
library where she reveled.

Laurie enjoyed that immensely, and when she told about the prim
old gentleman who came once to woo Aunt March, and in the middle of
a fine speech, how Poll had tweaked his wig off to his great
dismay, the boy lay back and laughed till the tears ran down his
cheeks, and a maid popped her head in to see what was the
matter.

"Oh! That does me no end of good. Tell on, please," he said,
taking his face out of the sofa cushion, red and shining with
merriment.
