"I was wondering how you and Amy get on together."<br/><br/>"Like angels!"<br/><br/>"Yes, of course, but which rules?"<br/><br/>"I don't mind telling you that she does now, at least I let her<br/>think so, it pleases her, you know. By-and-by we shall take turns,<br/>for marriage, they say, halves one's rights and doubles one's<br/>duties."<br/><br/>"You'll go on as you begin, and Amy will rule you all the days<br/>of your life."<br/><br/>"Well, she does it so imperceptibly that I don't think I shall<br/>mind much. She is the sort of woman who knows how to rule well. In<br/>fact, I rather like it, for she winds one round her finger as<br/>softly and prettily as a skein of silk, and makes you feel as if<br/>she was doing you a favor all the while."<br/><br/>"That ever I should live to see you a henpecked husband and<br/>enjoying it!" cried Jo, with uplifted hands.<br/><br/>It was good to see Laurie square his shoulders, and smile with<br/>masculine scorn at that insinuation, as he replied, with his "high<br/>and mighty" air, "Amy is too well-bred for that, and I am not the<br/>sort of man to submit to it. My wife and I respect ourselves and<br/>one another too much ever to tyrannize or quarrel."<br/><br/>Jo liked that, and thought the new dignity very becoming, but<br/>the boy seemed changing very fast into the man, and regret mingled<br/>with her pleasure.<br/><br/>"I am sure of that. Amy and you never did quarrel as we used to.<br/>She is the sun and I the wind, in the fable, and the sun managed<br/>the man best, you remember."<br/><br/>"She can blow him up as well as shine on him," laughed Laurie.<br/>"such a lecture as I got at Nice! I give you my word it was a deal<br/>worse than any of your scoldings, a regular rouser. I'll tell you<br/>all about it sometime, she never will, because after telling me<br/>that she despised and was ashamed of me, she lost her heart to the<br/>despicable party and married the good-for-nothing."<br/>
