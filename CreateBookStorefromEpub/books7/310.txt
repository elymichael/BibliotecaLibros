"My dear, go out to service in that great boarding house!" and
Mrs. March looked surprised, but not displeased.

"It's not exactly going out to service, for Mrs. Kirke is your
friend—the kindest soul that ever lived—and would make things
pleasant for me, I know. Her family is separate from the rest, and
no one knows me there. Don't care if they do. It's honest work, and
I'm not ashamed of it."

"Nor I. But your writing?"

"All the better for the change. I shall see and hear new things,
get new ideas, and even if I haven't much time there, I shall bring
home quantities of material for my rubbish."

"I have no doubt of it, but are these your only reasons for this
sudden fancy?"

"No, Mother."

"May I know the others?"

Jo looked up and Jo looked down, then said slowly, with sudden
color in her cheeks. "It may be vain and wrong to say it, but—I'm
afraid—Laurie is getting too fond of me."

"Then you don't care for him in the way it is evident he begins
to care for you?" and Mrs. March looked anxious as she put the
question.

"Mercy, no! I love the dear boy, as I always have, and am
immensely proud of him, but as for anything more, it's out of the
question."
