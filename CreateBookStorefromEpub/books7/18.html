<br/>They were soon ready, and the procession set out. Fortunately it<br/>was early, and they went through back streets, so few people saw<br/>them, and no one laughed at the queer party.<br/><br/>A poor, bare, miserable room it was, with broken windows, no<br/>fire, ragged bedclothes, a sick mother, wailing baby, and a group<br/>of pale, hungry children cuddled under one old quilt, trying to<br/>keep warm.<br/><br/>How the big eyes stared and the blue lips smiled as the girls<br/>went in.<br/><br/>"Ach, mein Gott! It is good angels come to us!" said the poor<br/>woman, crying for joy.<br/><br/>"Funny angels in hoods and mittens," said Jo, and set them to<br/>laughing.<br/><br/>In a few minutes it really did seem as if kind spirits had been<br/>at work there. Hannah, who had carried wood, made a fire, and<br/>stopped up the broken panes with old hats and her own cloak. Mrs.<br/>March gave the mother tea and gruel, and comforted her with<br/>promises of help, while she dressed the little baby as tenderly as<br/>if it had been her own. The girls meantime spread the table, set<br/>the children round the fire, and fed them like so many hungry<br/>birds, laughing, talking, and trying to understand the funny broken<br/>English.<br/><br/>"Das ist gut!" "Die Engel-kinder!" cried the poor things as they<br/>ate and warmed their purple hands at the comfortable blaze. The<br/>girls had never been called angel children before, and thought it<br/>very agreeable, especially Jo, who had been considered a 'Sancho'<br/>ever since she was born. That was a very happy breakfast, though<br/>they didn't get any of it. And when they went away, leaving comfort<br/>behind, I think there were not in all the city four merrier people<br/>than the hungry little girls who gave away their breakfasts and<br/>contented themselves with bread and milk on Christmas morning.<br/><br/>"That's loving our neighbor better than ourselves, and I like<br/>it," said Meg, as they set out their presents while their mother<br/>was upstairs collecting clothes for the poor Hummels.<br/><br/>Not a very splendid show, but there was a great deal of love<br/>done up in the few little bundles, and the tall vase of red roses,<br/>white chrysanthemums, and trailing vines, which stood in the<br/>middle, gave quite an elegant air to the table.<br/><br/>"She's coming! Strike up, Beth! Open the door, Amy! Three cheers<br/>for Marmee!" cried Jo, prancing about while Meg went to conduct<br/>Mother to the seat of honor.<br/><br/>
