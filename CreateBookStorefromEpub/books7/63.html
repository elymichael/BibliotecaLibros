"You'll have to go and thank him," said Jo, by way of a joke,<br/>for the idea of the child's really going never entered her<br/>head.<br/><br/>"Yes, I mean to. I guess I'll go now, before I get frightened<br/>thinking about it." And, to the utter amazement of the assembled<br/>family, Beth walked deliberately down the garden, through the<br/>hedge, and in at the Laurences' door.<br/><br/>"Well, I wish I may die if it ain't the queerest thing I ever<br/>see! The pianny has turned her head! She'd never have gone in her<br/>right mind," cried Hannah, staring after her, while the girls were<br/>rendered quite speechless by the miracle.<br/><br/>They would have been still more amazed if they had seen what<br/>Beth did afterward. If you will believe me, she went and knocked at<br/>the study door before she gave herself time to think, and when a<br/>gruff voice called out, "come in!" she did go in, right up to Mr.<br/>Laurence, who looked quite taken aback, and held out her hand,<br/>saying, with only a small quaver in her voice, "I came to thank<br/>you, sir, forâ€¦ " But she didn't finish, for he looked so friendly<br/>that she forgot her speech and, only remembering that he had lost<br/>the little girl he loved, she put both arms round his neck and<br/>kissed him.<br/><br/>If the roof of the house had suddenly flown off, the old<br/>gentleman wouldn't have been more astonished. But he liked it. Oh,<br/>dear, yes, he liked it amazingly! And was so touched and pleased by<br/>that confiding little kiss that all his crustiness vanished, and he<br/>just set her on his knee, and laid his wrinkled cheek against her<br/>rosy one, feeling as if he had got his own little granddaughter<br/>back again. Beth ceased to fear him from that moment, and sat there<br/>talking to him as cozily as if she had known him all her life, for<br/>love casts out fear, and gratitude can conquer pride. When she went<br/>home, he walked with her to her own gate, shook hands cordially,<br/>and touched his hat as he marched back again, looking very stately<br/>and erect, like a handsome, soldierly old gentleman, as he was.<br/><br/>When the girls saw that performance, Jo began to dance a jig, by<br/>way of expressing her satisfaction, Amy nearly fell out of the<br/>window in her surprise, and Meg exclaimed, with up-lifted hands,<br/>"Well, I do believe the world is coming to an end."<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
