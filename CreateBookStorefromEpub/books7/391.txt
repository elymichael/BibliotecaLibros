"I've no heart to write, and if I had, nobody cares for my
things."

"We do. Write something for us, and never mind the rest of the
world. Try it, dear. I'm sure it would do you good, and please us
very much."

"Don't believe I can." But Jo got out her desk and began to
overhaul her half-finished manuscripts.

An hour afterward her mother peeped in and there she was,
scratching away, with her black pinafore on, and an absorbed
expression, which caused Mrs. March to smile and slip away, well
pleased with the success of her suggestion. Jo never knew how it
happened, but something got into that story that went straight to
the hearts of those who read it, for when her family had laughed
and cried over it, her father sent it, much against her will, to
one of the popular magazines, and to her utter surprise, it was not
only paid for, but others requested. Letters from several persons,
whose praise was honor, followed the appearance of the little
story, newspapers copied it, and strangers as well as friends
admired it. For a small thing it was a great success, and Jo was
more astonished than when her novel was commended and condemned all
at once.

"I don't understand it. What can there be in a simple little
story like that to make people praise it so?" she said, quite
bewildered.

"There is truth in it, Jo, that's the secret. Humor and pathos
make it alive, and you have found your style at last. You wrote
with no thoughts of fame and money, and put your heart into it, my
daughter. You have had the bitter, now comes the sweet. Do your
best, and grow as happy as we are in your success."

"If there is anything good or true in what I write, it isn't
mine. I owe it all to you and Mother and Beth," said Jo, more
touched by her father's words than by any amount of praise from the
world.

So taught by love and sorrow, Jo wrote her little stories, and
sent them away to make friends for themselves and her, finding it a
very charitable world to such humble wanderers, for they were
kindly welcomed, and sent home comfortable tokens to their mother,
like dutiful children whom good fortune overtakes.

When Amy and Laurie wrote of their engagement, Mrs. March feared
that Jo would find it difficult to rejoice over it, but her fears
were soon set at rest, for though Jo looked grave at first, she
took it very quietly, and was full of hopes and plans for 'the
children' before she read the letter twice. It was a sort of
written duet, wherein each glorified the other in loverlike
fashion, very pleasant to read and satisfactory to think of, for no
one had any objection to make.

"You like it, Mother?" said Jo, as they laid down the closely
written sheets and looked at one another.

"Yes, I hoped it would be so, ever since Amy wrote that she had
refused Fred. I felt sure then that something better than what you
call the 'mercenary spirit' had come over her, and a hint here and
there in her letters made me suspect that love and Laurie would win
the day."
