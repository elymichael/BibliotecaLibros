As the President finished reading the paper (which I beg leave
to assure my readers is a bona fide copy of one written by bona
fide girls once upon a time), a round of applause followed, and
then Mr. Snodgrass rose to make a proposition.

"Mr. President and gentlemen," he began, assuming a
parliamentary attitude and tone, "I wish to propose the admission
of a new member—one who highly deserves the honor, would be deeply
grateful for it, and would add immensely to the spirit of the club,
the literary value of the paper, and be no end jolly and nice. I
propose Mr. Theodore Laurence as an honorary member of the P. C.
Come now, do have him."

Jo's sudden change of tone made the girls laugh, but all looked
rather anxious, and no one said a word as Snodgrass took his
seat.

"We'll put it to a vote," said the President. "All in favor of
this motion please to manifest it by saying, 'Aye'."
