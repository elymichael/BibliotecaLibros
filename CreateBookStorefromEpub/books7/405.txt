A pleasing fiction, by the way, for Jo had no more idea of music
than a grasshopper. But she would have consented if he had proposed
to sing a whole opera, and warbled away, blissfully regardless of
time and tune. It didn't much matter, for Mr. Bhaer sang like a
true German, heartily and well, and Jo soon subsided into a subdued
hum, that she might listen to the mellow voice that seemed to sing
for her alone.


Know'st thou the land where the citron blooms,


used to be the Professor's favorite line, for
'das land' meant Germany to him, but now he seemed to dwell, with
peculiar warmth and melody, upon the words…


There, oh there, might I with thee,
O, my beloved, go


and one listener was so thrilled by the tender
invitation that she longed to say she did know the land, and would
joyfully depart thither whenever he liked.

The song was considered a great success, and the singer retired
covered with laurels. But a few minutes afterward, he forgot his
manners entirely, and stared at Amy putting on her bonnet, for she
had been introduced simply as 'my sister', and no one had called
her by her new name since he came. He forgot himself still further
when Laurie said, in his most gracious manner, at parting…

"My wife and I are very glad to meet you, sir. Please remember
that there is always a welcome waiting for you over the way."

Then the Professor thanked him so heartily, and looked so
suddenly illuminated with satisfaction, that Laurie thought him the
most delightfully demonstrative old fellow he ever met.
