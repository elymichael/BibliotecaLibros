S. PICKWICK<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Why is the P. C. like the Tower of Babel?<br/><br/>It is full of unruly members.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>________<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>THE HISTORY OF A SQUASH<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Once upon a time a farmer planted a little seed in his garden,<br/>and after a while it sprouted and became a vine and bore many<br/>squashes. One day in October, when they were ripe, he picked one<br/>and took it to market. A gorcerman bought and put it in his shop.<br/>That same morning, a little girl in a brown hat and blue dress,<br/>with a round face and snub nose, went and bought it for her mother.<br/>She lugged it home, cut it up, and boiled it in the big pot, mashed<br/>some of it with salt and butter, for dinner. And to the rest she<br/>added a pint of milk, two eggs, four spoons of sugar, nutmeg, and<br/>some crackers, put it in a deep dish, and baked it till it was<br/>brown and nice, and next day it was eaten by a family named<br/>March.<br/><br/>T.
