<br/>"No slang," snapped Jo, slamming down the pillow. But it was too<br/>late, there was no room for it, and coasting onto the floor, it<br/>disappeared in a most mysterious manner.<br/><br/>"Come, Jo, don't be thorny. After studying himself to a skeleton<br/>all the week, a fellow deserves petting and ought to get it."<br/><br/>"Beth will pet you. I'm busy."<br/><br/>"No, she's not to be bothered with me, but you like that sort of<br/>thing, unless you've suddenly lost your taste for it. Have you? Do<br/>you hate your boy, and want to fire pillows at him?"<br/><br/>Anything more wheedlesome than that touching appeal was seldom<br/>heard, but Jo quenched 'her boy' by turning on him with a stern<br/>query, "How many bouquets have you sent Miss Randal this week?"<br/><br/>"Not one, upon my word. She's engaged. Now then."<br/><br/>"I'm glad of it, that's one of your foolish extravagances,<br/>sending flowers and things to girls for whom you don't care two<br/>pins," continued Jo reprovingly.<br/><br/>"Sensible girls for whom I do care whole papers of pins won't<br/>let me send them 'flowers and things', so what can I do? My<br/>feelings need a 'vent'."<br/><br/>"Mother doesn't approve of flirting even in fun, and you do<br/>flirt desperately, Teddy."<br/><br/>"I'd give anything if I could answer, 'So do you'. As I can't,<br/>I'll merely say that I don't see any harm in that pleasant little<br/>game, if all parties understand that it's only play."<br/><br/>
