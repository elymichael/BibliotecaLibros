"Unfortunately I have an engagement. Au revoir, madamoiselle,"
and Laurie bent as if to kiss her hand, in the foreign fashion,
which became him better than many men. Something in his face made
Amy say quickly and warmlyâ€¦

"No, be yourself with me, Laurie, and part in the good old way.
I'd rather have a hearty English handshake than all the sentimental
salutations in France."

"Goodbye, dear," and with these words, uttered in the tone she
liked, Laurie left her, after a handshake almost painful in its
heartiness.

Next morning, instead of the usual call, Amy received a note
which made her smile at the beginning and sigh at the end.


My Dear Mentor, Please make my adieux to your
aunt, and exult within yourself, for 'Lazy Laurence' has gone to
his grandpa, like the best of boys. A pleasant winter to you, and
may the gods grant you a blissful honeymoon at Valrosa! I think
Fred would be benefited by a rouser. Tell him so, with my
congratulations.

Yours gratefully, Telemachus


"Good boy! I'm glad he's gone," said Amy, with an approving
smile. The next minute her face fell as she glanced about the empty
room, adding, with an involuntary sigh, "Yes, I am glad, but how I
shall miss him."
