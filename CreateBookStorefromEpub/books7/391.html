"I've no heart to write, and if I had, nobody cares for my<br/>things."<br/><br/>"We do. Write something for us, and never mind the rest of the<br/>world. Try it, dear. I'm sure it would do you good, and please us<br/>very much."<br/><br/>"Don't believe I can." But Jo got out her desk and began to<br/>overhaul her half-finished manuscripts.<br/><br/>An hour afterward her mother peeped in and there she was,<br/>scratching away, with her black pinafore on, and an absorbed<br/>expression, which caused Mrs. March to smile and slip away, well<br/>pleased with the success of her suggestion. Jo never knew how it<br/>happened, but something got into that story that went straight to<br/>the hearts of those who read it, for when her family had laughed<br/>and cried over it, her father sent it, much against her will, to<br/>one of the popular magazines, and to her utter surprise, it was not<br/>only paid for, but others requested. Letters from several persons,<br/>whose praise was honor, followed the appearance of the little<br/>story, newspapers copied it, and strangers as well as friends<br/>admired it. For a small thing it was a great success, and Jo was<br/>more astonished than when her novel was commended and condemned all<br/>at once.<br/><br/>"I don't understand it. What can there be in a simple little<br/>story like that to make people praise it so?" she said, quite<br/>bewildered.<br/><br/>"There is truth in it, Jo, that's the secret. Humor and pathos<br/>make it alive, and you have found your style at last. You wrote<br/>with no thoughts of fame and money, and put your heart into it, my<br/>daughter. You have had the bitter, now comes the sweet. Do your<br/>best, and grow as happy as we are in your success."<br/><br/>"If there is anything good or true in what I write, it isn't<br/>mine. I owe it all to you and Mother and Beth," said Jo, more<br/>touched by her father's words than by any amount of praise from the<br/>world.<br/><br/>So taught by love and sorrow, Jo wrote her little stories, and<br/>sent them away to make friends for themselves and her, finding it a<br/>very charitable world to such humble wanderers, for they were<br/>kindly welcomed, and sent home comfortable tokens to their mother,<br/>like dutiful children whom good fortune overtakes.<br/><br/>When Amy and Laurie wrote of their engagement, Mrs. March feared<br/>that Jo would find it difficult to rejoice over it, but her fears<br/>were soon set at rest, for though Jo looked grave at first, she<br/>took it very quietly, and was full of hopes and plans for 'the<br/>children' before she read the letter twice. It was a sort of<br/>written duet, wherein each glorified the other in loverlike<br/>fashion, very pleasant to read and satisfactory to think of, for no<br/>one had any objection to make.<br/><br/>"You like it, Mother?" said Jo, as they laid down the closely<br/>written sheets and looked at one another.<br/><br/>"Yes, I hoped it would be so, ever since Amy wrote that she had<br/>refused Fred. I felt sure then that something better than what you<br/>call the 'mercenary spirit' had come over her, and a hint here and<br/>there in her letters made me suspect that love and Laurie would win<br/>the day."<br/>
