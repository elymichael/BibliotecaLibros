"Why?" asked Meg, looking surprised.<br/><br/>"Because if you care much about riches, you will never go and<br/>marry a poor man," said Jo, frowning at Laurie, who was mutely<br/>warning her to mind what she said.<br/><br/>"I shall never 'go and marry' anyone," observed Meg, walking on<br/>with great dignity while the others followed, laughing, whispering,<br/>skipping stones, and 'behaving like children', as Meg said to<br/>herself, though she might have been tempted to join them if she had<br/>not had her best dress on.<br/><br/>For a week or two, Jo behaved so queerly that her sisters were<br/>quite bewildered. She rushed to the door when the postman rang, was<br/>rude to Mr. Brooke whenever they met, would sit looking at Meg with<br/>a woe-begone face, occasionally jumping up to shake and then kiss<br/>her in a very mysterious manner. Laurie and she were always making<br/>signs to one another, and talking about 'Spread Eagles' till the<br/>girls declared they had both lost their wits. On the second<br/>Saturday after Jo got out of the window, Meg, as she sat sewing at<br/>her window, was scandalized by the sight of Laurie chasing Jo all<br/>over the garden and finally capturing her in Amy's bower. What went<br/>on there, Meg could not see, but shrieks of laughter were heard,<br/>followed by the murmur of voices and a great flapping of<br/>newspapers.<br/><br/>"What shall we do with that girl? She never will behave like a<br/>young lady," sighed Meg, as she watched the race with a<br/>disapproving face.<br/><br/>"I hope she won't. She is so funny and dear as she is," said<br/>Beth, who had never betrayed that she was a little hurt at Jo's<br/>having secrets with anyone but her.<br/><br/>"It's very trying, but we never can make her comme la fo," added<br/>Amy, who sat making some new frills for herself, with her curls<br/>tied up in a very becoming way, two agreeable things that made her<br/>feel unusually elegant and ladylike.<br/><br/>In a few minutes Jo bounced in, laid herself on the sofa, and<br/>affected to read.<br/><br/>"Have you anything interesting there?" asked Meg, with<br/>condescension.<br/><br/>"Nothing but a story, won't amount to much, I guess," returned<br/>Jo, carefully keeping the name of the paper out of sight.<br/><br/>"You'd better read it aloud. That will amuse us and keep you out<br/>of mischief," said Amy in her most grown-up tone.<br/>
