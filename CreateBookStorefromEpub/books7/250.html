<br/>Jo's angles are much softened, she has learned to carry herself<br/>with ease, if not grace. The curly crop has lengthened into a thick<br/>coil, more becoming to the small head atop of the tall figure.<br/>There is a fresh color in her brown cheeks, a soft shine in her<br/>eyes, and only gentle words fall from her sharp tongue today.<br/><br/>Beth has grown slender, pale, and more quiet than ever. The<br/>beautiful, kind eyes are larger, and in them lies an expression<br/>that saddens one, although it is not sad itself. It is the shadow<br/>of pain which touches the young face with such pathetic patience,<br/>but Beth seldom complains and always speaks hopefully of 'being<br/>better soon'.<br/><br/>Amy is with truth considered 'the flower of the family', for at<br/>sixteen she has the air and bearing of a full-grown woman, not<br/>beautiful, but possessed of that indescribable charm called grace.<br/>One saw it in the lines of her figure, the make and motion of her<br/>hands, the flow of her dress, the droop of her hair, unconscious<br/>yet harmonious, and as attractive to many as beauty itself. Amy's<br/>nose still afflicted her, for it never would grow Grecian, so did<br/>her mouth, being too wide, and having a decided chin. These<br/>offending features gave character to her whole face, but she never<br/>could see it, and consoled herself with her wonderfully fair<br/>complexion, keen blue eyes, and curls more golden and abundant than<br/>ever.<br/><br/>All three wore suits of thin silver gray (their best gowns for<br/>the summer), with blush roses in hair and bosom, and all three<br/>looked just what they were, fresh-faced, happy-hearted girls,<br/>pausing a moment in their busy lives to read with wistful eyes the<br/>sweetest chapter in the romance of womanhood.<br/><br/>There were to be no ceremonious performances, everything was to<br/>be as natural and homelike as possible, so when Aunt March arrived,<br/>she was scandalized to see the bride come running to welcome and<br/>lead her in, to find the bridegroom fastening up a garland that had<br/>fallen down, and to catch a glimpse of the paternal minister<br/>marching upstairs with a grave countenance and a wine bottle under<br/>each arm.<br/><br/>"Upon my word, here's a state of things!" cried the old lady,<br/>taking the seat of honor prepared for her, and settling the folds<br/>of her lavender moire with a great rustle. "You oughtn't to be seen<br/>till the last minute, child."<br/><br/>"I'm not a show, Aunty, and no one is coming to stare at me, to<br/>criticize my dress, or count the cost of my luncheon. I'm too happy<br/>to care what anyone says or thinks, and I'm going to have my little<br/>wedding just as I like it. John, dear, here's your hammer." And<br/>away went Meg to help 'that man' in his highly improper<br/>employment.<br/><br/>Mr. Brooke didn't even say, "Thank you," but as he stooped for<br/>the unromantic tool, he kissed his little bride behind the folding<br/>door, with a look that made Aunt March whisk out her pocket<br/>handkerchief with a sudden dew in her sharp old eyes.<br/><br/>A crash, a cry, and a laugh from Laurie, accompanied by the<br/>indecorous exclamation, "Jupiter Ammon! Jo's upset the cake again!"<br/>caused a momentary flurry, which was hardly over when a flock of<br/>cousins arrived, and 'the party came in', as Beth used to say when<br/>a child.<br/><br/>"Don't let that young giant come near me, he worries me worse<br/>than mosquitoes," whispered the old lady to Amy, as the rooms<br/>filled and Laurie's black head towered above the rest.<br/><br/>
