"Hurrah for Miss March, the celebrated American authoress!"
cried Laurie, throwing up his hat and catching it again, to the
great delight of two ducks, four cats, five hens, and half a dozen
Irish children, for they were out of the city now.

"Hush! It won't come to anything, I dare say, but I couldn't
rest till I had tried, and I said nothing about it because I didn't
want anyone else to be disappointed."

"It won't fail. Why, Jo, your stories are works of Shakespeare
compared to half the rubbish that is published every day. Won't it
be fun to see them in print, and shan't we feel proud of our
authoress?"

Jo's eyes sparkled, for it is always pleasant to be believed in,
and a friend's praise is always sweeter than a dozen newspaper
puffs.

"Where's your secret? Play fair, Teddy, or I'll never believe
you again," she said, trying to extinguish the brilliant hopes that
blazed up at a word of encouragement.

"I may get into a scrape for telling, but I didn't promise not
to, so I will, for I never feel easy in my mind till I've told you
any plummy bit of news I get. I know where Meg's glove is."

"Is that all?" said Jo, looking disappointed, as Laurie nodded
and twinkled with a face full of mysterious intelligence.

"It's quite enough for the present, as you'll agree when I tell
you where it is."

"Tell, then."

Laurie bent, and whispered three words in Jo's ear, which
produced a comical change. She stood and stared at him for a
minute, looking both surprised and displeased, then walked on,
saying sharply, "How do you know?"

"Saw it."
