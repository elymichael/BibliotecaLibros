<br/>At that minute Jo was particularly absorbed in dressmaking, for<br/>she was mantua-maker general to the family, and took especial<br/>credit to herself because she could use a needle as well as a pen.<br/>It was very provoking to be arrested in the act of a first<br/>trying-on, and ordered out to make calls in her best array on a<br/>warm July day. She hated calls of the formal sort, and never made<br/>any till Amy compelled her with a bargain, bribe, or promise. In<br/>the present instance there was no escape, and having clashed her<br/>scissors rebelliously, while protesting that she smelled thunder,<br/>she gave in, put away her work, and taking up her hat and gloves<br/>with an air of resignation, told Amy the victim was ready.<br/><br/>"Jo March, you are perverse enough to provoke a saint! You don't<br/>intend to make calls in that state, I hope," cried Amy, surveying<br/>her with amazement.<br/><br/>"Why not? I'm neat and cool and comfortable, quite proper for a<br/>dusty walk on a warm day. If people care more for my clothes than<br/>they do for me, I don't wish to see them. You can dress for both,<br/>and be as elegant as you please. It pays for you to be fine. It<br/>doesn't for me, and furbelows only worry me."<br/><br/>"Oh, dear!" sighed Amy, "now she's in a contrary fit, and will<br/>drive me distracted before I can get her properly ready. I'm sure<br/>it's no pleasure to me to go today, but it's a debt we owe society,<br/>and there's no one to pay it but you and me. I'll do anything for<br/>you, Jo, if you'll only dress yourself nicely, and come and help me<br/>do the civil. You can talk so well, look so aristocratic in your<br/>best things, and behave so beautifully, if you try, that I'm proud<br/>of you. I'm afraid to go alone, do come and take care of me."<br/><br/>"You're an artful little puss to flatter and wheedle your cross<br/>old sister in that way. The idea of my being aristocratic and<br/>well-bred, and your being afraid to go anywhere alone! I don't know<br/>which is the most absurd. Well, I'll go if I must, and do my best.<br/>You shall be commander of the expedition, and I'll obey blindly,<br/>will that satisfy you?" said Jo, with a sudden change from<br/>perversity to lamblike submission.<br/><br/>"You're a perfect cherub! Now put on all your best things, and<br/>I'll tell you how to behave at each place, so that you will make a<br/>good impression. I want people to like you, and they would if you'd<br/>only try to be a little more agreeable. Do your hair the pretty<br/>way, and put the pink rose in your bonnet. It's becoming, and you<br/>look too sober in your plain suit. Take your light gloves and the<br/>embroidered handkerchief. We'll stop at Meg's, and borrow her white<br/>sunshade, and then you can have my dove-colored one."<br/><br/>While Amy dressed, she issued her orders, and Jo obeyed them,<br/>not without entering her protest, however, for she sighed as she<br/>rustled into her new organdie, frowned darkly at herself as she<br/>tied her bonnet strings in an irreproachable bow, wrestled<br/>viciously with pins as she put on her collar, wrinkled up her<br/>features generally as she shook out the handkerchief, whose<br/>embroidery was as irritating to her nose as the present mission was<br/>to her feelings, and when she had squeezed her hands into tight<br/>gloves with three buttons and a tassel, as the last touch of<br/>elegance, she turned to Amy with an imbecile expression of<br/>countenance, saying meeklyâ€¦<br/><br/>"I'm perfectly miserable, but if you consider me presentable, I<br/>die happy."<br/><br/>"You're highly satisfactory. Turn slowly round, and let me get a<br/>careful view." Jo revolved, and Amy gave a touch here and there,<br/>then fell back, with her head on one side, observing graciously,<br/>"Yes, you'll do. Your head is all I could ask, for that white<br/>bonnet with the rose is quite ravishing. Hold back your shoulders,<br/>and carry your hands easily, no matter if your gloves do pinch.<br/>There's one thing you can do well, Jo, that is, wear a shawl. I<br/>can't, but it's very nice to see you, and I'm so glad Aunt March<br/>gave you that lovely one. It's simple, but handsome, and those<br/>folds over the arm are really artistic. Is the point of my mantle<br/>in the middle, and have I looped my dress evenly? I like to show my<br/>boots, for my feet are pretty, though my nose isn't."<br/><br/>"You are a thing of beauty and a joy forever," said Jo, looking<br/>through her hand with the air of a connoisseur at the blue feather<br/>against the golden hair. "Am I to drag my best dress through the<br/>dust, or loop it up, please, ma'am?"<br/><br/>
