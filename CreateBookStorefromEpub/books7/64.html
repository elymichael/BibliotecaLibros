<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>7<br/>Amyâ€™s Valley of Humiliation<br/><br/><br/>"That boy is a perfect cyclops, isn't he?" said Amy one day, as<br/>Laurie clattered by on horseback, with a flourish of his whip as he<br/>passed.<br/><br/>"How dare you say so, when he's got both his eyes? And very<br/>handsome ones they are, too," cried Jo, who resented any slighting<br/>remarks about her friend.<br/><br/>"I didn't say anything about his eyes, and I don't see why you<br/>need fire up when I admire his riding."<br/><br/>"Oh, my goodness! That little goose means a centaur, and she<br/>called him a Cyclops," exclaimed Jo, with a burst of laughter.<br/><br/>"You needn't be so rude, it's only a 'lapse of lingy', as Mr.<br/>Davis says," retorted Amy, finishing Jo with her Latin. "I just<br/>wish I had a little of the money Laurie spends on that horse," she<br/>added, as if to herself, yet hoping her sisters would hear.<br/><br/>"Why?" asked Meg kindly, for Jo had gone off in another laugh at<br/>Amy's second blunder.<br/><br/>"I need it so much. I'm dreadfully in debt, and it won't be my<br/>turn to have the rag money for a month."<br/>
