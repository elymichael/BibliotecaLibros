<br/>"A ravishingly lovely lady, who exclaimed, with a cry of<br/>rapture, 'At last! At last!'" continued Kate, who had read French<br/>novels, and admired the style. "'Tis she!' cried Count Gustave, and<br/>fell at her feet in an ecstasy of joy. 'Oh, rise!' she said,<br/>extending a hand of marble fairness. 'Never! Till you tell me how I<br/>may rescue you,' swore the knight, still kneeling. 'Alas, my cruel<br/>fate condemns me to remain here till my tyrant is destroyed.'<br/>'Where is the villain?' 'In the mauve salon. Go, brave heart, and<br/>save me from despair.' 'I obey, and return victorious or dead!'<br/>With these thrilling words he rushed away, and flinging open the<br/>door of the mauve salon, was about to enter, when he received…<br/>"<br/><br/>"A stunning blow from the big Greek lexicon, which an old fellow<br/>in a black gown fired at him," said Ned. "Instantly, Sir<br/>What's-his-name recovered himself, pitched the tyrant out of the<br/>window, and turned to join the lady, victorious, but with a bump on<br/>his brow, found the door locked, tore up the curtains, made a rope<br/>ladder, got halfway down when the ladder broke, and he went<br/>headfirst into the moat, sixty feet below. Could swim like a duck,<br/>paddled round the castle till he came to a little door guarded by<br/>two stout fellows, knocked their heads together till they cracked<br/>like a couple of nuts, then, by a trifling exertion of his<br/>prodigious strength, he smashed in the door, went up a pair of<br/>stone steps covered with dust a foot thick, toads as big as your<br/>fist, and spiders that would frighten you into hysterics, Miss<br/>March. At the top of these steps he came plump upon a sight that<br/>took his breath away and chilled his blood… "<br/><br/>"A tall figure, all in white with a veil over its face and a<br/>lamp in its wasted hand," went on Meg. "It beckoned, gliding<br/>noiselessly before him down a corridor as dark and cold as any<br/>tomb. Shadowy effigies in armor stood on either side, a dead<br/>silence reigned, the lamp burned blue, and the ghostly figure ever<br/>and anon turned its face toward him, showing the glitter of awful<br/>eyes through its white veil. They reached a curtained door, behind<br/>which sounded lovely music. He sprang forward to enter, but the<br/>specter plucked him back, and waved threateningly before him a…<br/>"<br/><br/>"Snuffbox," said Jo, in a sepulchral tone, which convulsed the<br/>audience. "'Thankee,' said the knight politely, as he took a pinch<br/>and sneezed seven times so violently that his head fell off. 'Ha!<br/>Ha!' laughed the ghost, and having peeped through the keyhole at<br/>the princesses spinning away for dear life, the evil spirit picked<br/>up her victim and put him in a large tin box, where there were<br/>eleven other knights packed together without their heads, like<br/>sardines, who all rose and began to… "<br/><br/>"Dance a hornpipe," cut in Fred, as Jo paused for breath, "and,<br/>as they danced, the rubbishy old castle turned to a man-of-war in<br/>full sail. 'Up with the jib, reef the tops'l halliards, helm hard<br/>alee, and man the guns!' roared the captain, as a Portuguese pirate<br/>hove in sight, with a flag black as ink flying from her foremast.<br/>'Go in and win, my hearties!' says the captain, and a tremendous<br/>fight began. Of course the British beat—they always do."<br/><br/>"No, they don't!" cried Jo, aside.<br/><br/>"Having taken the pirate captain prisoner, sailed slap over the<br/>schooner, whose decks were piled high with dead and whose lee<br/>scuppers ran blood, for the order had been 'Cutlasses, and die<br/>hard!' 'Bosun's mate, take a bight of the flying-jib sheet, and<br/>start this villain if he doesn't confess his sins double quick,'<br/>said the British captain. The Portuguese held his tongue like a<br/>brick, and walked the plank, while the jolly tars cheered like mad.<br/>But the sly dog dived, came up under the man-of-war, scuttled her,<br/>and down she went, with all sail set, 'To the bottom of the sea,<br/>sea, sea' where… "<br/><br/>"Oh, gracious! What shall I say?" cried Sallie, as Fred ended<br/>his rigmarole, in which he had jumbled together pell-mell nautical<br/>phrases and facts out of one of his favorite books. "Well, they<br/>went to the bottom, and a nice mermaid welcomed them, but was much<br/>grieved on finding the box of headless knights, and kindly pickled<br/>them in brine, hoping to discover the mystery about them, for being<br/>a woman, she was curious. By-and-by a diver came down, and the<br/>mermaid said, 'I'll give you a box of pearls if you can take it<br/>up,' for she wanted to restore the poor things to life, and<br/>couldn't raise the heavy load herself. So the diver hoisted it up,<br/>and was much disappointed on opening it to find no pearls. He left<br/>it in a great lonely field, where it was found by a… "<br/><br/>"Little goose girl, who kept a hundred fat geese in the field,"<br/>said Amy, when Sallie's invention gave out. "The little girl was<br/>sorry for them, and asked an old woman what she should do to help<br/>them. 'Your geese will tell you, they know everything.' said the<br/>old woman. So she asked what she should use for new heads, since<br/>the old ones were lost, and all the geese opened their hundred<br/>mouths and screamed… "<br/><br/>"'Cabbages!'" continued Laurie promptly. "'Just the thing,' said<br/>the girl, and ran to get twelve fine ones from her garden. She put<br/>them on, the knights revived at once, thanked her, and went on<br/>their way rejoicing, never knowing the difference, for there were<br/>so many other heads like them in the world that no one thought<br/>anything of it. The knight in whom I'm interested went back to find<br/>the pretty face, and learned that the princesses had spun<br/>themselves free and all gone and married, but one. He was in a<br/>great state of mind at that, and mounting the colt, who stood by<br/>him through thick and thin, rushed to the castle to see which was<br/>left. Peeping over the hedge, he saw the queen of his affections<br/>picking flowers in her garden. 'Will you give me a rose?' said he.<br/>'You must come and get it. I can't come to you, it isn't proper,'<br/>said she, as sweet as honey. He tried to climb over the hedge, but<br/>it seemed to grow higher and higher. Then he tried to push through,<br/>but it grew thicker and thicker, and he was in despair. So he<br/>patiently broke twig after twig till he had made a little hole<br/>through which he peeped, saying imploringly, 'Let me in! Let me<br/>in!' But the pretty princess did not seem to understand, for she<br/>picked her roses quietly, and left him to fight his way in. Whether<br/>he did or not, Frank will tell you."<br/><br/>
