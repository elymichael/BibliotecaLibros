"The… The jelly won't jell and I don't know what to do!"

John Brooke laughed then as he never dared to laugh afterward,
and the derisive Scott smiled involuntarily as he heard the hearty
peal, which put the finishing stroke to poor Meg's woe.

"Is that all? Fling it out of the window, and don't bother any
more about it. I'll buy you quarts if you want it, but for heaven's
sake don't have hysterics, for I've brought Jack Scott home to
dinner, and… "

John got no further, for Meg cast him off, and clasped her hands
with a tragic gesture as she fell into a chair, exclaiming in a
tone of mingled indignation, reproach, and dismay…

"A man to dinner, and everything in a mess! John Brooke, how
could you do such a thing?"

"Hush, he's in the garden! I forgot the confounded jelly, but it
can't be helped now," said John, surveying the prospect with an
anxious eye.

"You ought to have sent word, or told me this morning, and you
ought to have remembered how busy I was," continued Meg petulantly,
for even turtledoves will peck when ruffled.

"I didn't know it this morning, and there was no time to send
word, for I met him on the way out. I never thought of asking
leave, when you have always told me to do as I liked. I never tried
it before, and hang me if I ever do again!" added John, with an
aggrieved air.

"I should hope not! Take him away at once. I can't see him, and
there isn't any dinner."

"Well, I like that! Where's the beef and vegetables I sent home,
and the pudding you promised?" cried John, rushing to the
larder.

"I hadn't time to cook anything. I meant to dine at Mother's.
I'm sorry, but I was so busy," and Meg's tears began again.
