Why is the P. C. like the Tower of Babel?

It is full of unruly members.

THE HISTORY OF A SQUASH

&#160;

Once upon a time a farmer planted a little seed in his garden,
and after a while it sprouted and became a vine and bore many
squashes. One day in October, when they were ripe, he picked one
and took it to market. A gorcerman bought and put it in his shop.
That same morning, a little girl in a brown hat and blue dress,
with a round face and snub nose, went and bought it for her mother.
She lugged it home, cut it up, and boiled it in the big pot, mashed
some of it with salt and butter, for dinner. And to the rest she
added a pint of milk, two eggs, four spoons of sugar, nutmeg, and
some crackers, put it in a deep dish, and baked it till it was
brown and nice, and next day it was eaten by a family named
March.
