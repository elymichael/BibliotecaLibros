', and played it as he never did before.

"That's very fine, I dare say, but it's sad enough to make one
cry. Give us something gayer, lad," said Mr. Laurence, whose kind
old heart was full of sympathy, which he longed to show but knew
not how.

Laurie dashed into a livelier strain, played stormily for
several minutes, and would have got through bravely, if in a
momentary lull Mrs. March's voice had not been heard calling, "Jo,
dear, come in. I want you."

Just what Laurie longed to say, with a different meaning! As he
listened, he lost his place, the music ended with a broken chord,
and the musician sat silent in the dark.

"I can't stand this," muttered the old gentleman. Up he got,
groped his way to the piano, laid a kind hand on either of the
broad shoulders, and said, as gently as a woman, "I know, my boy, I
know."

No answer for an instant, then Laurie asked sharply, "Who told
you?"

"Jo herself."

"Then there's an end of it!" And he shook off his grandfather's
hands with an impatient motion, for though grateful for the
sympathy, his man's pride could not bear a man's pity.

"Not quite. I want to say one thing, and then there shall be an
end of it," returned Mr. Laurence with unusual mildness. "You won't
care to stay at home now, perhaps?"

"I don't intend to run away from a girl. Jo can't prevent my
seeing her, and I shall stay and do it as long as I like,"
interrupted Laurie in a defiant tone.

"Not if you are the gentleman I think you. I'm disappointed, but
the girl can't help it, and the only thing left for you to do is to
go away for a time. Where will you go?"
