"Could you spare me some of your cake? I really need some, I
have so much company, and I can't make such delicious stuff as
yours," asked Meg soberly.

"Take it all. I'm the only one here who likes sweet things, and
it will mold before I can dispose of it," answered Amy, thinking
with a sigh of the generous store she had laid in for such an end
as this.

"It's a pity Laurie isn't here to help us," began Jo, as they
sat down to ice cream and salad for the second time in two
days.

A warning look from her mother checked any further remarks, and
the whole family ate in heroic silence, till Mr. March mildly
observed, "salad was one of the favorite dishes of the ancients,
and Evelynâ€¦ " Here a general explosion of laughter cut short the
'history of salads', to the great surprise of the learned
gentleman.

"Bundle everything into a basket and send it to the Hummels.
Germans like messes. I'm sick of the sight of this, and there's no
reason you should all die of a surfeit because I've been a fool,"
cried Amy, wiping her eyes.

"I thought I should have died when I saw you two girls rattling
about in the what-you-call-it, like two little kernels in a very
big nutshell, and Mother waiting in state to receive the throng,"
sighed Jo, quite spent with laughter.

"I'm very sorry you were disappointed, dear, but we all did our
best to satisfy you," said Mrs. March, in a tone full of motherly
regret.

"I am satisfied. I've done what I undertook, and it's not my
fault that it failed. I comfort myself with that," said Amy with a
little quiver in her voice. "I thank you all very much for helping
me, and I'll thank you still more if you won't allude to it for a
month, at least."

No one did for several months, but the word 'fete' always
produced a general smile, and Laurie's birthday gift to Amy was a
tiny coral lobster in the shape of a charm for her watch guard.
