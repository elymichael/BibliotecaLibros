Here lies Pip March,
Who died the 7th of June;
Loved and lamented sore,
And not forgotten soon.


At the conclusion of the ceremonies, Beth retired to her room,
overcome with emotion and lobster, but there was no place of
repose, for the beds were not made, and she found her grief much
assuaged by beating up the pillows and putting things in order. Meg
helped Jo clear away the remains of the feast, which took half the
afternoon and left them so tired that they agreed to be contented
with tea and toast for supper.

Laurie took Amy to drive, which was a deed of charity, for the
sour cream seemed to have had a bad effect upon her temper. Mrs.
March came home to find the three older girls hard at work in the
middle of the afternoon, and a glance at the closet gave her an
idea of the success of one part of the experiment.

Before the housewives could rest, several people called, and
there was a scramble to get ready to see them. Then tea must be
got, errands done, and one or two necessary bits of sewing
neglected until the last minute. As twilight fell, dewy and still,
one by one they gathered on the porch where the June roses were
budding beautifully, and each groaned or sighed as she sat down, as
if tired or troubled.

"What a dreadful day this has been!" began Jo, usually the first
to speak.

"It has seemed shorter than usual, but so uncomfortable," said
Meg.

"Not a bit like home," added Amy.

"It can't seem so without Marmee and little Pip," sighed Beth,
glancing with full eyes at the empty cage above her head.
