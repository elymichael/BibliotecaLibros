<br/>Jo thanked him and gladly went, wishing she had two neat gloves<br/>when she saw the nice, pearl-colored ones her partner wore. The<br/>hall was empty, and they had a grand polka, for Laurie danced well,<br/>and taught her the German step, which delighted Jo, being full of<br/>swing and spring. When the music stopped, they sat down on the<br/>stairs to get their breath, and Laurie was in the midst of an<br/>account of a students' festival at Heidelberg when Meg appeared in<br/>search of her sister. She beckoned, and Jo reluctantly followed her<br/>into a side room, where she found her on a sofa, holding her foot,<br/>and looking pale.<br/><br/>"I've sprained my ankle. That stupid high heel turned and gave<br/>me a sad wrench. It aches so, I can hardly stand, and I don't know<br/>how I'm ever going to get home," she said, rocking to and fro in<br/>pain.<br/><br/>"I knew you'd hurt your feet with those silly shoes. I'm sorry.<br/>But I don't see what you can do, except get a carriage, or stay<br/>here all night," answered Jo, softly rubbing the poor ankle as she<br/>spoke.<br/><br/>"I can't have a carriage without its costing ever so much. I<br/>dare say I can't get one at all, for most people come in their own,<br/>and it's a long way to the stable, and no one to send."<br/><br/>"I'll go."<br/><br/>"No, indeed! It's past nine, and dark as Egypt. I can't stop<br/>here, for the house is full. Sallie has some girls staying with<br/>her. I'll rest till Hannah comes, and then do the best I can."<br/><br/>"I'll ask Laurie. He will go," said Jo, looking relieved as the<br/>idea occurred to her.<br/><br/>"Mercy, no! Don't ask or tell anyone. Get me my rubbers, and put<br/>these slippers with our things. I can't dance anymore, but as soon<br/>as supper is over, watch for Hannah and tell me the minute she<br/>comes."<br/><br/>"They are going out to supper now. I'll stay with you. I'd<br/>rather."<br/><br/>"No, dear, run along, and bring me some coffee. I'm so tired I<br/>can't stir."<br/><br/>
