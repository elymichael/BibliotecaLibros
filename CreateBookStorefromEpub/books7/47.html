"Don't you read?"<br/><br/>"Not much. They won't let me."<br/><br/>"Can't somebody read to you?"<br/><br/>"Grandpa does sometimes, but my books don't interest him, and I<br/>hate to ask Brooke all the time."<br/><br/>"Have someone come and see you then."<br/><br/>"There isn't anyone I'd like to see. Boys make such a row, and<br/>my head is weak."<br/><br/>"Isn't there some nice girl who'd read and amuse you? Girls are<br/>quiet and like to play nurse."<br/><br/>"Don't know any."<br/><br/>"You know us," began Jo, then laughed and stopped.<br/><br/>"So I do! Will you come, please?" cried Laurie.<br/><br/>"I'm not quiet and nice, but I'll come, if Mother will let me.<br/>I'll go ask her. Shut the window, like a good boy, and wait till I<br/>come."<br/>
