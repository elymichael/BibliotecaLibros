<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>15<br/>On the Shelf<br/><br/><br/>In France the young girls have a dull time of it till they are<br/>married, when 'Vive la liberte!' becomes their motto. In America,<br/>as everyone knows, girls early sign the declaration of<br/>independence, and enjoy their freedom with republican zest, but the<br/>young matrons usually abdicate with the first heir to the throne<br/>and go into a seclusion almost as close as a French nunnery, though<br/>by no means as quiet. Whether they like it or not, they are<br/>virtually put upon the shelf as soon as the wedding excitement is<br/>over, and most of them might exclaim, as did a very pretty woman<br/>the other day, "I'm as handsome as ever, but no one takes any<br/>notice of me because I'm married."<br/><br/>Not being a belle or even a fashionable lady, Meg did not<br/>experience this affliction till her babies were a year old, for in<br/>her little world primitive customs prevailed, and she found herself<br/>more admired and beloved than ever.<br/><br/>As she was a womanly little woman, the maternal instinct was<br/>very strong, and she was entirely absorbed in her children, to the<br/>utter exclusion of everything and everybody else. Day and night she<br/>brooded over them with tireless devotion and anxiety, leaving John<br/>to the tender mercies of the help, for an Irish lady now presided<br/>over the kitchen department. Being a domestic man, John decidedly<br/>missed the wifely attentions he had been accustomed to receive, but<br/>as he adored his babies, he cheerfully relinquished his comfort for<br/>a time, supposing with masculine ignorance that peace would soon be<br/>restored. But three months passed, and there was no return of<br/>repose. Meg looked worn and nervous, the babies absorbed every<br/>minute of her time, the house was neglected, and Kitty, the cook,<br/>who took life 'aisy', kept him on short commons. When he went out<br/>in the morning he was bewildered by small commissions for the<br/>captive mamma, if he came gaily in at night, eager to embrace his<br/>family, he was quenched by a "Hush! They are just asleep after<br/>worrying all day." If he proposed a little amusement at home, "No,<br/>it would disturb the babies." If he hinted at a lecture or a<br/>concert, he was answered with a reproachful look, and a<br/>decided—"Leave my children for pleasure, never!" His sleep was<br/>broken by infant wails and visions of a phantom figure pacing<br/>noiselessly to and fro in the watches of the night. His meals were<br/>interrupted by the frequent flight of the presiding genius, who<br/>deserted him, half-helped, if a muffled chirp sounded from the nest<br/>above. And when he read his paper of an evening, Demi's colic got<br/>into the shipping list and Daisy's fall affected the price of<br/>stocks, for Mrs. Brooke was only interested in domestic news.<br/><br/>The poor man was very uncomfortable, for the children had bereft<br/>him of his wife, home was merely a nursery and the perpetual<br/>'hushing' made him feel like a brutal intruder whenever he entered<br/>the sacred precincts of Babyland. He bore it very patiently for six<br/>months, and when no signs of amendment appeared, he did what other<br/>paternal exiles do—tried to get a little comfort elsewhere. Scott<br/>had married and gone to housekeeping not far off, and John fell<br/>into the way of running over for an hour or two of an evening, when<br/>his own parlor was empty, and his own wife singing lullabies that<br/>seemed to have no end. Mrs. Scott was a lively, pretty girl, with<br/>nothing to do but be agreeable, and she performed her mission most<br/>successfully. The parlor was always bright and attractive, the<br/>chessboard ready, the piano in tune, plenty of gay gossip, and a<br/>nice little supper set forth in tempting style.<br/><br/>John would have preferred his own fireside if it had not been so<br/>lonely, but as it was he gratefully took the next best thing and<br/>enjoyed his neighbor's society.<br/><br/>Meg rather approved of the new arrangement at first, and found<br/>it a relief to know that John was having a good time instead of<br/>dozing in the parlor, or tramping about the house and waking the<br/>children. But by-and-by, when the teething worry was over and the<br/>idols went to sleep at proper hours, leaving Mamma time to rest,<br/>she began to miss John, and find her workbasket dull company, when<br/>he was not sitting opposite in his old dressing gown, comfortably<br/>scorching his slippers on the fender. She would not ask him to stay<br/>at home, but felt injured because he did not know that she wanted<br/>him without being told, entirely forgetting the many evenings he<br/>had waited for her in vain. She was nervous and worn out with<br/>watching and worry, and in that unreasonable frame of mind which<br/>the best of mothers occasionally experience when domestic cares<br/>oppress them. Want of exercise robs them of cheerfulness, and too<br/>much devotion to that idol of American women, the teapot, makes<br/>them feel as if they were all nerve and no muscle.<br/><br/>"Yes," she would say, looking in the glass, "I'm getting old and<br/>ugly. John doesn't find me interesting any longer, so he leaves his<br/>faded wife and goes to see his pretty neighbor, who has no<br/>incumbrances. Well, the babies love me, they don't care if I am<br/>thin and pale and haven't time to crimp my hair, they are my<br/>comfort, and some day John will see what I've gladly sacrificed for<br/>them, won't he, my precious?"<br/>
