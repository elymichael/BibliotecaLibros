"He has promised to be very good today, and he can be perfectly<br/>elegant if he likes," returned Amy, and gliding away to warn<br/>Hercules to beware of the dragon, which warning caused him to haunt<br/>the old lady with a devotion that nearly distracted her.<br/><br/>There was no bridal procession, but a sudden silence fell upon<br/>the room as Mr. March and the young couple took their places under<br/>the green arch. Mother and sisters gathered close, as if loath to<br/>give Meg up. The fatherly voice broke more than once, which only<br/>seemed to make the service more beautiful and solemn. The<br/>bridegroom's hand trembled visibly, and no one heard his replies.<br/>But Meg looked straight up in her husband's eyes, and said, "I<br/>will!" with such tender trust in her own face and voice that her<br/>mother's heart rejoiced and Aunt March sniffed audibly.<br/><br/>Jo did not cry, though she was very near it once, and was only<br/>saved from a demonstration by the consciousness that Laurie was<br/>staring fixedly at her, with a comical mixture of merriment and<br/>emotion in his wicked black eyes. Beth kept her face hidden on her<br/>mother's shoulder, but Amy stood like a graceful statue, with a<br/>most becoming ray of sunshine touching her white forehead and the<br/>flower in her hair.<br/><br/>It wasn't at all the thing, I'm afraid, but the minute she was<br/>fairly married, Meg cried, "The first kiss for Marmee!" and<br/>turning, gave it with her heart on her lips. During the next<br/>fifteen minutes she looked more like a rose than ever, for everyone<br/>availed themselves of their privileges to the fullest extent, from<br/>Mr. Laurence to old Hannah, who, adorned with a headdress fearfully<br/>and wonderfully made, fell upon her in the hall, crying with a sob<br/>and a chuckle, "Bless you, deary, a hundred times! The cake ain't<br/>hurt a mite, and everything looks lovely."<br/><br/>Everybody cleared up after that, and said something brilliant,<br/>or tried to, which did just as well, for laughter is ready when<br/>hearts are light. There was no display of gifts, for they were<br/>already in the little house, nor was there an elaborate breakfast,<br/>but a plentiful lunch of cake and fruit, dressed with flowers. Mr.<br/>Laurence and Aunt March shrugged and smiled at one another when<br/>water, lemonade, and coffee were found to be to only sorts of<br/>nectar which the three Hebes carried round. No one said anything,<br/>till Laurie, who insisted on serving the bride, appeared before<br/>her, with a loaded salver in his hand and a puzzled expression on<br/>his face.<br/><br/>"Has Jo smashed all the bottles by accident?" he whispered, "or<br/>am I merely laboring under a delusion that I saw some lying about<br/>loose this morning?"<br/><br/>"No, your grandfather kindly offered us his best, and Aunt March<br/>actually sent some, but Father put away a little for Beth, and<br/>dispatched the rest to the Soldier's Home. You know he thinks that<br/>wine should be used only in illness, and Mother says that neither<br/>she nor her daughters will ever offer it to any young man under her<br/>roof."<br/><br/>Meg spoke seriously and expected to see Laurie frown or laugh,<br/>but he did neither, for after a quick look at her, he said, in his<br/>impetuous way, "I like that! For I've seen enough harm done to wish<br/>other women would think as you do."<br/><br/>"You are not made wise by experience, I hope?" and there was an<br/>anxious accent in Meg's voice.<br/><br/>"No. I give you my word for it. Don't think too well of me,<br/>either, this is not one of my temptations. Being brought up where<br/>wine is as common as water and almost as harmless, I don't care for<br/>it, but when a pretty girl offers it, one doesn't like to refuse,<br/>you see."<br/><br/>"But you will, for the sake of others, if not for your own.<br/>Come, Laurie, promise, and give me one more reason to call this the<br/>happiest day of my life."<br/>
