"It's that naughty boy. I told him to go to sleep alone, and
here he is, downstairs, getting his death a-cold pattering over
that canvas," said Meg, answering the call.

"Mornin' now," announced Demi in joyful tone as he entered, with
his long nightgown gracefully festooned over his arm and every curl
bobbing gayly as he pranced about the table, eyeing the 'cakies'
with loving glances.

"No, it isn't morning yet. You must go to bed, and not trouble
poor Mamma. Then you can have the little cake with sugar on
it."

"Me loves Parpar," said the artful one, preparing to climb the
paternal knee and revel in forbidden joys. But John shook his head,
and said to Megâ€¦

"If you told him to stay up there, and go to sleep alone, make
him do it, or he will never learn to mind you."

"Yes, of course. Come, Demi," and Meg led her son away, feeling
a strong desire to spank the little marplot who hopped beside her,
laboring under the delusion that the bribe was to be administered
as soon as they reached the nursery.

Nor was he disappointed, for that shortsighted woman actually
gave him a lump of sugar, tucked him into his bed, and forbade any
more promenades till morning.

"Iss!" said Demi the perjured, blissfully sucking his sugar, and
regarding his first attempt as eminently successful.

Meg returned to her place, and supper was progressing
pleasantly, when the little ghost walked again, and exposed the
maternal delinquencies by boldly demanding, "More sudar,
Marmar."

"Now this won't do," said John, hardening his heart against the
engaging little sinner. "We shall never know any peace till that
child learns to go to bed properly. You have made a slave of
yourself long enough. Give him one lesson, and then there will be
an end of it. Put him in his bed and leave him, Meg."
