"Begging your pardon, ma'am, it wasn't a billiard saloon, but a<br/>gymnasium, and I was taking a lesson in fencing."<br/><br/>"I'm glad of that."<br/><br/>"Why?"<br/><br/>"You can teach me, and then when we play&#160;<br/>Hamlet<br/>,<br/>you can be Laertes, and we'll make a fine thing of the fencing<br/>scene."<br/><br/>Laurie burst out with a hearty boy's laugh, which made several<br/>passers-by smile in spite of themselves.<br/><br/>"I'll teach you whether we play&#160;<br/>Hamlet<br/>&#160;or<br/>not. It's grand fun and will straighten you up capitally. But I<br/>don't believe that was your only reason for saying 'I'm glad' in<br/>that decided way, was it now?"<br/><br/>"No, I was glad that you were not in the saloon, because I hope<br/>you never go to such places. Do you?"<br/><br/>"Not often."<br/><br/>"I wish you wouldn't."<br/>
