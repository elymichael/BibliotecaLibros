A loud response from Snodgrass, followed, to everybody's
surprise, by a timid one from Beth.

"Contrary-minded say, 'No'."

Meg and Amy were contrary-minded, and Mr. Winkle rose to say
with great elegance, "We don't wish any boys, they only joke and
bounce about. This is a ladies' club, and we wish to be private and
proper."

"I'm afraid he'll laugh at our paper, and make fun of us
afterward," observed Pickwick, pulling the little curl on her
forehead, as she always did when doubtful.

Up rose Snodgrass, very much in earnest. "Sir, I give you my
word as a gentleman, Laurie won't do anything of the sort. He likes
to write, and he'll give a tone to our contributions and keep us
from being sentimental, don't you see? We can do so little for him,
and he does so much for us, I think the least we can do is to offer
him a place here, and make him welcome if he comes."

This artful allusion to benefits conferred brought Tupman to his
feet, looking as if he had quite made up his mind.

"Yes; we ought to do it, even if we are afraid. I say he may
come, and his grandpa, too, if he likes."

This spirited burst from Beth electrified the club, and Jo left
her seat to shake hands approvingly. "Now then, vote again.
Everybody remember it's our Laurie, and say, 'Aye!'" cried
Snodgrass excitedly.

"Aye! Aye! Aye!" replied three voices at once.

"Good! Bless you! Now, as there's nothing like 'taking time by
the fetlock', as Winkle characteristically observes, allow me to
present the new member." And, to the dismay of the rest of the
club, Jo threw open the door of the closet, and displayed Laurie
sitting on a rag bag, flushed and twinkling with suppressed
laughter.
