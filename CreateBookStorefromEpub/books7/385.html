Fred Vaughn had returned, and put the question to which she had<br/>once decided to answer, "Yes, thank you," but now she said, "No,<br/>thank you," kindly but steadily, for when the time came, her<br/>courage failed her, and she found that something more than money<br/>and position was needed to satisfy the new longing that filled her<br/>heart so full of tender hopes and fears. The words, "Fred is a good<br/>fellow, but not at all the man I fancied you would ever like," and<br/>Laurie's face when he uttered them, kept returning to her as<br/>pertinaciously as her own did when she said in look, if not in<br/>words, "I shall marry for money." It troubled her to remember that<br/>now, she wished she could take it back, it sounded so unwomanly.<br/>She didn't want Laurie to think her a heartless, worldly creature.<br/>She didn't care to be a queen of society now half so much as she<br/>did to be a lovable woman. She was so glad he didn't hate her for<br/>the dreadful things she said, but took them so beautifully and was<br/>kinder than ever. His letters were such a comfort, for the home<br/>letters were very irregular and not half so satisfactory as his<br/>when they did come. It was not only a pleasure, but a duty to<br/>answer them, for the poor fellow was forlorn, and needed petting,<br/>since Jo persisted in being stonyhearted. She ought to have made an<br/>effort and tried to love him. It couldn't be very hard, many people<br/>would be proud and glad to have such a dear boy care for them. But<br/>Jo never would act like other girls, so there was nothing to do but<br/>be very kind and treat him like a brother.<br/><br/>If all brothers were treated as well as Laurie was at this<br/>period, they would be a much happier race of beings than they are.<br/>Amy never lectured now. She asked his opinion on all subjects, she<br/>was interested in everything he did, made charming little presents<br/>for him, and sent him two letters a week, full of lively gossip,<br/>sisterly confidences, and captivating sketches of the lovely scenes<br/>about her. As few brothers are complimented by having their letters<br/>carried about in their sister's pockets, read and reread<br/>diligently, cried over when short, kissed when long, and treasured<br/>carefully, we will not hint that Amy did any of these fond and<br/>foolish things. But she certainly did grow a little pale and<br/>pensive that spring, lost much of her relish for society, and went<br/>out sketching alone a good deal. She never had much to show when<br/>she came home, but was studying nature, I dare say, while she sat<br/>for hours, with her hands folded, on the terrace at Valrosa, or<br/>absently sketched any fancy that occurred to her, a stalwart knight<br/>carved on a tomb, a young man asleep in the grass, with his hat<br/>over his eyes, or a curly haired girl in gorgeous array,<br/>promenading down a ballroom on the arm of a tall gentleman, both<br/>faces being left a blur according to the last fashion in art, which<br/>was safe but not altogether satisfactory.<br/><br/>Her aunt thought that she regretted her answer to Fred, and<br/>finding denials useless and explanations impossible, Amy left her<br/>to think what she liked, taking care that Laurie should know that<br/>Fred had gone to Egypt. That was all, but he understood it, and<br/>looked relieved, as he said to himself, with a venerable air…<br/><br/>"I was sure she would think better of it. Poor old fellow! I've<br/>been through it all, and I can sympathize."<br/><br/>With that he heaved a great sigh, and then, as if he had<br/>discharged his duty to the past, put his feet up on the sofa and<br/>enjoyed Amy's letter luxuriously.<br/><br/>While these changes were going on abroad, trouble had come at<br/>home. But the letter telling that Beth was failing never reached<br/>Amy, and when the next found her at Vevay, for the heat had driven<br/>them from Nice in May, and they had travelled slowly to<br/>Switzerland, by way of Genoa and the Italian lakes. She bore it<br/>very well, and quietly submitted to the family decree that she<br/>should not shorten her visit, for since it was too late to say<br/>goodbye to Beth, she had better stay, and let absence soften her<br/>sorrow. But her heart was very heavy, she longed to be at home, and<br/>every day looked wistfully across the lake, waiting for Laurie to<br/>come and comfort her.<br/><br/>He did come very soon, for the same mail brought letters to them<br/>both, but he was in Germany, and it took some days to reach him.<br/>The moment he read it, he packed his knapsack, bade adieu to his<br/>fellow pedestrians, and was off to keep his promise, with a heart<br/>full of joy and sorrow, hope and suspense.<br/><br/>He knew Vevay well, and as soon as the boat touched the little<br/>quay, he hurried along the shore to La Tour, where the Carrols were<br/>living en pension. The garcon was in despair that the whole family<br/>had gone to take a promenade on the lake, but no, the blonde<br/>mademoiselle might be in the chateau garden. If monsieur would give<br/>himself the pain of sitting down, a flash of time should present<br/>her. But monsieur could not wait even a 'flash of time', and in the<br/>middle of the speech departed to find mademoiselle himself.<br/><br/>A pleasant old garden on the borders of the lovely lake, with<br/>chestnuts rustling overhead, ivy climbing everywhere, and the black<br/>shadow of the tower falling far across the sunny water. At one<br/>corner of the wide, low wall was a seat, and here Amy often came to<br/>read or work, or console herself with the beauty all about her. She<br/>was sitting here that day, leaning her head on her hand, with a<br/>homesick heart and heavy eyes, thinking of Beth and wondering why<br/>Laurie did not come. She did not hear him cross the courtyard<br/>beyond, nor see him pause in the archway that led from the<br/>subterranean path into the garden. He stood a minute looking at her<br/>with new eyes, seeing what no one had ever seen before, the tender<br/>side of Amy's character. Everything about her mutely suggested love<br/>and sorrow, the blotted letters in her lap, the black ribbon that<br/>tied up her hair, the womanly pain and patience in her face, even<br/>the little ebony cross at her throat seemed pathetic to Laurie, for<br/>he had given it to her, and she wore it as her only ornament. If he<br/>had any doubts about the reception she would give him, they were<br/>set at rest the minute she looked up and saw him, for dropping<br/>everything, she ran to him, exclaiming in a tone of unmistakable<br/>love and longing…<br/><br/>"Oh, Laurie, Laurie, I knew you'd come to me!"<br/><br/>I think everything was said and settled then, for as they stood<br/>together quite silent for a moment, with the dark head bent down<br/>protectingly over the light one, Amy felt that no one could comfort<br/>and sustain her so well as Laurie, and Laurie decided that Amy was<br/>the only woman in the world who could fill Jo's place and make him<br/>happy. He did not tell her so, but she was not disappointed, for<br/>both felt the truth, were satisfied, and gladly left the rest to<br/>silence.<br/>
