"What happens then, a ball?"

"A Christmas party at our hotel. There are many Americans there,
and they give it in honor of the day. You'll go with us, of course?
Aunt will be charmed."

"Thank you. Where now?" asked Laurie, leaning back and folding
his arms, a proceeding which suited Amy, who preferred to drive,
for her parasol whip and blue reins over the white ponies backs
afforded her infinite satisfaction.

"I'm going to the bankers first for letters, and then to Castle
Hill. The view is so lovely, and I like to feed the peacocks. Have
you ever been there?"

"Often, years ago, but I don't mind having a look at it."

"Now tell me all about yourself. The last I heard of you, your
grandfather wrote that he expected you from Berlin."

"Yes, I spent a month there and then joined him in Paris, where
he has settled for the winter. He has friends there and finds
plenty to amuse him, so I go and come, and we get on
capitally."

"That's a sociable arrangement," said Amy, missing something in
Laurie's manner, though she couldn't tell what.

"Why, you see, he hates to travel, and I hate to keep still, so
we each suit ourselves, and there is no trouble. I am often with
him, and he enjoys my adventures, while I like to feel that someone
is glad to see me when I get back from my wanderings. Dirty old
hole, isn't it?" he added, with a look of disgust as they drove
along the boulevard to the Place Napoleon in the old city.

"The dirt is picturesque, so I don't mind. The river and the
hills are delicious, and these glimpses of the narrow cross streets
are my delight. Now we shall have to wait for that procession to
pass. It's going to the Church of St. John."
