"Yes, out it came, and away ran Polly, frightened to death, and
scrambled up on Aunt's chair, calling out, 'Catch her! Catch her!
Catch her!' as I chased the spider."

"That's a lie! Oh, lor!" cried the parrot, pecking at Laurie's
toes.

"I'd wring your neck if you were mine, you old torment," cried
Laurie, shaking his fist at the bird, who put his head on one side
and gravely croaked, "Allyluyer! bless your buttons, dear!"

"Now I'm ready," said Amy, shutting the wardrobe and taking a
piece of paper out of her pocket. "I want you to read that, please,
and tell me if it is legal and right. I felt I ought to do it, for
life is uncertain and I don't want any ill feeling over my
tomb."

Laurie bit his lips, and turning a little from the pensive
speaker, read the following document, with praiseworthy gravity,
considering the spelling:


MY LAST WILL AND TESTIMENT

I, Amy Curtis March, being in my sane mind, go
give and bequeethe all my earthly property—viz. to wit:—namely

To my father, my best pictures, sketches, maps,
and works of art, including frames. Also my $100, to do what he
likes with.

To my mother, all my clothes, except the blue
apron with pockets—also my likeness, and my medal, with much
love.

To my dear sister Margaret, I give my turkquoise
ring (if I get it), also my green box with the doves on it, also my
piece of real lace for her neck, and my sketch of her as a memorial
of her 'little girl'.
