"Use the chicken then, the toughness won't matter in a salad,"
advised his wife.

"Hannah left it on the kitchen table a minute, and the kittens
got at it. I'm very sorry, Amy," added Beth, who was still a
patroness of cats.

"Then I must have a lobster, for tongue alone won't do," said
Amy decidedly.

"Shall I rush into town and demand one?" asked Jo, with the
magnanimity of a martyr.

"You'd come bringing it home under your arm without any paper,
just to try me. I'll go myself," answered Amy, whose temper was
beginning to fail.

Shrouded in a thick veil and armed with a genteel traveling
basket, she departed, feeling that a cool drive would soothe her
ruffled spirit and fit her for the labors of the day. After some
delay, the object of her desire was procured, likewise a bottle of
dressing to prevent further loss of time at home, and off she drove
again, well pleased with her own forethought.

As the omnibus contained only one other passenger, a sleepy old
lady, Amy pocketed her veil and beguiled the tedium of the way by
trying to find out where all her money had gone to. So busy was she
with her card full of refractory figures that she did not observe a
newcomer, who entered without stopping the vehicle, till a
masculine voice said, "Good morning, Miss March," and, looking up,
she beheld one of Laurie's most elegant college friends. Fervently
hoping that he would get out before she did, Amy utterly ignored
the basket at her feet, and congratulating herself that she had on
her new traveling dress, returned the young man's greeting with her
usual suavity and spirit.

They got on excellently, for Amy's chief care was soon set at
rest by learning that the gentleman would leave first, and she was
chatting away in a peculiarly lofty strain, when the old lady got
out. In stumbling to the door, she upset the basket, and—oh
horror!—the lobster, in all its vulgar size and brilliancy, was
revealed to the highborn eyes of a Tudor!

"By Jove, she's forgotten her dinner!" cried the unconscious
youth, poking the scarlet monster into its place with his cane, and
preparing to hand out the basket after the old lady.

"Please don't—it's—it's mine," murmured Amy, with a face nearly
as red as her fish.

"Oh, really, I beg pardon. It's an uncommonly fine one, isn't
it?" said Tudor, with great presence of mind, and an air of sober
interest that did credit to his breeding.
