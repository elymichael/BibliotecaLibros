"I'll try, but it was a very ungentlemanly thing to do, I didn't<br/>think you could be so sly and malicious, Laurie," replied Meg,<br/>trying to hide her maidenly confusion under a gravely reproachful<br/>air.<br/><br/>"It was altogether abominable, and I don't deserve to be spoken<br/>to for a month, but you will, though, won't you?" And Laurie folded<br/>his hands together with such and imploring gesture, as he spoke in<br/>his irresistibly persuasive tone, that it was impossible to frown<br/>upon him in spite of his scandalous behavior.<br/><br/>Meg pardoned him, and Mrs. March's grave face relaxed, in spite<br/>of her efforts to keep sober, when she heard him declare that he<br/>would atone for his sins by all sorts of penances, and abase<br/>himself like a worm before the injured damsel.<br/><br/>Jo stood aloof, meanwhile, trying to harden her heart against<br/>him, and succeeding only in primming up her face into an expression<br/>of entire disapprobation. Laurie looked at her once or twice, but<br/>as she showed no sign of relenting, he felt injured, and turned his<br/>back on her till the others were done with him, when he made her a<br/>low bow and walked off without a word.<br/><br/>As soon as he had gone, she wished she had been more forgiving,<br/>and when Meg and her mother went upstairs, she felt lonely and<br/>longed for Teddy. After resisting for some time, she yielded to the<br/>impulse, and armed with a book to return, went over to the big<br/>house.<br/><br/>"Is Mr. Laurence in?" asked Jo, of a housemaid, who was coming<br/>downstairs.<br/><br/>"Yes, Miss, but I don't believe he's seeable just yet."<br/><br/>"Why not? Is he ill?"<br/><br/>"La, no Miss, but he's had a scene with Mr. Laurie, who is in<br/>one of his tantrums about something, which vexes the old gentleman,<br/>so I dursn't go nigh him."<br/><br/>"Where is Laurie?"<br/><br/>"Shut up in his room, and he won't answer, though I've been<br/>a-tapping. I don't know what's to become of the dinner, for it's<br/>ready, and there's no one to eat it."<br/>
