Beth played her gayest march, Amy threw open the door, and Meg<br/>enacted escort with great dignity. Mrs. March was both surprised<br/>and touched, and smiled with her eyes full as she examined her<br/>presents and read the little notes which accompanied them. The<br/>slippers went on at once, a new handkerchief was slipped into her<br/>pocket, well scented with Amy's cologne, the rose was fastened in<br/>her bosom, and the nice gloves were pronounced a perfect fit.<br/><br/>There was a good deal of laughing and kissing and explaining, in<br/>the simple, loving fashion which makes these home festivals so<br/>pleasant at the time, so sweet to remember long afterward, and then<br/>all fell to work.<br/><br/>The morning charities and ceremonies took so much time that the<br/>rest of the day was devoted to preparations for the evening<br/>festivities. Being still too young to go often to the theater, and<br/>not rich enough to afford any great outlay for private<br/>performances, the girls put their wits to work, and necessity being<br/>the mother of invention, made whatever they needed. Very clever<br/>were some of their productions, pasteboard guitars, antique lamps<br/>made of old-fashioned butter boats covered with silver paper,<br/>gorgeous robes of old cotton, glittering with tin spangles from a<br/>pickle factory, and armor covered with the same useful diamond<br/>shaped bits left in sheets when the lids of preserve pots were cut<br/>out. The big chamber was the scene of many innocent revels.<br/><br/>No gentleman were admitted, so Jo played male parts to her<br/>heart's content and took immense satisfaction in a pair of russet<br/>leather boots given her by a friend, who knew a lady who knew an<br/>actor. These boots, an old foil, and a slashed doublet once used by<br/>an artist for some picture, were Jo's chief treasures and appeared<br/>on all occasions. The smallness of the company made it necessary<br/>for the two principal actors to take several parts apiece, and they<br/>certainly deserved some credit for the hard work they did in<br/>learning three or four different parts, whisking in and out of<br/>various costumes, and managing the stage besides. It was excellent<br/>drill for their memories, a harmless amusement, and employed many<br/>hours which otherwise would have been idle, lonely, or spent in<br/>less profitable society.<br/><br/>On Christmas night, a dozen girls piled onto the bed which was<br/>the dress circle, and sat before the blue and yellow chintz<br/>curtains in a most flattering state of expectancy. There was a good<br/>deal of rustling and whispering behind the curtain, a trifle of<br/>lamp smoke, and an occasional giggle from Amy, who was apt to get<br/>hysterical in the excitement of the moment. Presently a bell<br/>sounded, the curtains flew apart, and the&#160;<br/>operatic<br/>tragedy<br/>&#160;began.<br/><br/>"A gloomy wood," according to the one playbill, was represented<br/>by a few shrubs in pots, green baize on the floor, and a cave in<br/>the distance. This cave was made with a clothes horse for a roof,<br/>bureaus for walls, and in it was a small furnace in full blast,<br/>with a black pot on it and an old witch bending over it. The stage<br/>was dark and the glow of the furnace had a fine effect, especially<br/>as real steam issued from the kettle when the witch took off the<br/>cover. A moment was allowed for the first thrill to subside, then<br/>Hugo, the villain, stalked in with a clanking sword at his side, a<br/>slouching hat, black beard, mysterious cloak, and the boots. After<br/>pacing to and fro in much agitation, he struck his forehead, and<br/>burst out in a wild strain, singing of his hatred for Roderigo, his<br/>love for Zara, and his pleasing resolution to kill the one and win<br/>the other. The gruff tones of Hugo's voice, with an occasional<br/>shout when his feelings overcame him, were very impressive, and the<br/>audience applauded the moment he paused for breath. Bowing with the<br/>air of one accustomed to public praise, he stole to the cavern and<br/>ordered Hagar to come forth with a commanding, "What ho, minion! I<br/>need thee!"<br/><br/>Out came Meg, with gray horsehair hanging about her face, a red<br/>and black robe, a staff, and cabalistic signs upon her cloak. Hugo<br/>demanded a potion to make Zara adore him, and one to destroy<br/>Roderigo. Hagar, in a fine dramatic melody, promised both, and<br/>proceeded to call up the spirit who would bring the love<br/>philter.<br/><br/><br/>Hither, hither, from thy home,<br/>Airy sprite, I bid thee come!<br/>Born of roses, fed on dew,<br/>Charms and potions canst thou brew?<br/>
