"I told you they dressed me up, but I didn't tell you that they<br/>powdered and squeezed and frizzled, and made me look like a<br/>fashion-plate. Laurie thought I wasn't proper. I know he did,<br/>though he didn't say so, and one man called me 'a doll'. I knew it<br/>was silly, but they flattered me and said I was a beauty, and<br/>quantities of nonsense, so I let them make a fool of me."<br/><br/>"Is that all?" asked Jo, as Mrs. March looked silently at the<br/>downcast face of her pretty daughter, and could not find it in her<br/>heart to blame her little follies.<br/><br/>"No, I drank champagne and romped and tried to flirt, and was<br/>altogether abominable," said Meg self-reproachfully.<br/><br/>"There is something more, I think." And Mrs. March smoothed the<br/>soft cheek, which suddenly grew rosy as Meg answered slowlyâ€¦<br/><br/>"Yes. It's very silly, but I want to tell it, because I hate to<br/>have people say and think such things about us and Laurie."<br/><br/>Then she told the various bits of gossip she had heard at the<br/>Moffats', and as she spoke, Jo saw her mother fold her lips<br/>tightly, as if ill pleased that such ideas should be put into Meg's<br/>innocent mind.<br/><br/>"Well, if that isn't the greatest rubbish I ever heard," cried<br/>Jo indignantly. "Why didn't you pop out and tell them so on the<br/>spot?"<br/><br/>"I couldn't, it was so embarrassing for me. I couldn't help<br/>hearing at first, and then I was so angry and ashamed, I didn't<br/>remember that I ought to go away."<br/><br/>"Just wait till I see Annie Moffat, and I'll show you how to<br/>settle such ridiculous stuff. The idea of having 'plans' and being<br/>kind to Laurie because he's rich and may marry us by-and-by! Won't<br/>he shout when I tell him what those silly things say about us poor<br/>children?" And Jo laughed, as if on second thoughts the thing<br/>struck her as a good joke.<br/><br/>"If you tell Laurie, I'll never forgive you! She mustn't, must<br/>she, Mother?" said Meg, looking distressed.<br/><br/>"No, never repeat that foolish gossip, and forget it as soon as<br/>you can," said Mrs. March gravely. "I was very unwise to let you go<br/>among people of whom I know so little, kind, I dare say, but<br/>worldly, ill-bred, and full of these vulgar ideas about young<br/>people. I am more sorry than I can express for the mischief this<br/>visit may have done you, Meg."<br/>
