<br/>Beth ate no more, but crept away to sit in her shadowy corner<br/>and brood over the delight to come, till the others were ready.<br/><br/>"I think it was so splendid in Father to go as chaplain when he<br/>was too old to be drafted, and not strong enough for a soldier,"<br/>said Meg warmly.<br/><br/>"Don't I wish I could go as a drummer, a vivanâ€”what's its name?<br/>Or a nurse, so I could be near him and help him," exclaimed Jo,<br/>with a groan.<br/><br/>"It must be very disagreeable to sleep in a tent, and eat all<br/>sorts of bad-tasting things, and drink out of a tin mug," sighed<br/>Amy.<br/><br/>"When will he come home, Marmee?" asked Beth, with a little<br/>quiver in her voice.<br/><br/>"Not for many months, dear, unless he is sick. He will stay and<br/>do his work faithfully as long as he can, and we won't ask for him<br/>back a minute sooner than he can be spared. Now come and hear the<br/>letter."<br/><br/>They all drew to the fire, Mother in the big chair with Beth at<br/>her feet, Meg and Amy perched on either arm of the chair, and Jo<br/>leaning on the back, where no one would see any sign of emotion if<br/>the letter should happen to be touching. Very few letters were<br/>written in those hard times that were not touching, especially<br/>those which fathers sent home. In this one little was said of the<br/>hardships endured, the dangers faced, or the homesickness<br/>conquered. It was a cheerful, hopeful letter, full of lively<br/>descriptions of camp life, marches, and military news, and only at<br/>the end did the writer's heart over-flow with fatherly love and<br/>longing for the little girls at home.<br/><br/>"Give them all of my dear love and a kiss. Tell them I think of<br/>them by day, pray for them by night, and find my best comfort in<br/>their affection at all times. A year seems very long to wait before<br/>I see them, but remind them that while we wait we may all work, so<br/>that these hard days need not be wasted. I know they will remember<br/>all I said to them, that they will be loving children to you, will<br/>do their duty faithfully, fight their bosom enemies bravely, and<br/>conquer themselves so beautifully that when I come back to them I<br/>may be fonder and prouder than ever of my little women." Everybody<br/>sniffed when they came to that part. Jo wasn't ashamed of the great<br/>tear that dropped off the end of her nose, and Amy never minded the<br/>rumpling of her curls as she hid her face on her mother's shoulder<br/>and sobbed out, "I am a selfish girl! But I'll truly try to be<br/>better, so he mayn't be disappointed in me by-and-by."<br/><br/>"We all will," cried Meg. "I think too much of my looks and hate<br/>to work, but won't any more, if I can help it."<br/><br/>"I'll try and be what he loves to call me, 'a little woman' and<br/>not be rough and wild, but do my duty here instead of wanting to be<br/>somewhere else," said Jo, thinking that keeping her temper at home<br/>was a much harder task than facing a rebel or two down South.<br/><br/>
