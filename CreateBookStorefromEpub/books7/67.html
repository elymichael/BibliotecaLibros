<br/>With a despairing glance at her set, she obeyed.<br/><br/>"You are sure there are no more?"<br/><br/>"I never lie, sir."<br/><br/>"So I see. Now take these disgusting things two by two, and<br/>throw them out of the window."<br/><br/>There was a simultaneous sigh, which created quite a little<br/>gust, as the last hope fled, and the treat was ravished from their<br/>longing lips. Scarlet with shame and anger, Amy went to and fro six<br/>dreadful times, and as each doomed couple, looking oh, so plump and<br/>juicy, fell from her reluctant hands, a shout from the street<br/>completed the anguish of the girls, for it told them that their<br/>feast was being exulted over by the little Irish children, who were<br/>their sworn foes. This—this was too much. All flashed indignant or<br/>appealing glances at the inexorable Davis, and one passionate lime<br/>lover burst into tears.<br/><br/>As Amy returned from her last trip, Mr. Davis gave a portentous<br/>"Hem!" and said, in his most impressive manner…<br/><br/>"Young ladies, you remember what I said to you a week ago.

That hiss, faint as it was,<br/>irritated the irascible gentleman, and sealed the culprit's<br/>fate.<br/><br/>"Your hand, Miss March!" was the only answer her mute appeal<br/>received, and too proud to cry or beseech, Amy set her teeth, threw<br/>back her head defiantly, and bore without flinching several<br/>tingling blows on her little palm. They were neither many nor<br/>heavy, but that made no difference to her. For the first time in<br/>her life she had been struck, and the disgrace, in her eyes, was as<br/>deep as if he had knocked her down.<br/><br/>"You will now stand on the platform till recess," said Mr.<br/>Davis, resolved to do the thing thoroughly, since he had begun.<br/><br/>
