<br/>"Two letters for Doctor Jo, a book, and a funny old hat, which<br/>covered the whole post office and stuck outside," said Beth,<br/>laughing as she went into the study where Jo sat writing.<br/><br/>"What a sly fellow Laurie is! I said I wished bigger hats were<br/>the fashion, because I burn my face every hot day. He said, 'Why<br/>mind the fashion? Wear a big hat, and be comfortable!' I said I<br/>would if I had one, and he has sent me this, to try me. I'll wear<br/>it for fun, and show him I don't care for the fashion." And hanging<br/>the antique broad-brim on a bust of Plato, Jo read her letters.<br/><br/>One from her mother made her cheeks glow and her eyes fill, for<br/>it said to her…<br/><br/><br/>My Dear:<br/><br/>I write a little word to tell you with how much<br/>satisfaction I watch your efforts to control your temper. You say<br/>nothing about your trials, failures, or successes, and think,<br/>perhaps, that no one sees them but the Friend whose help you daily<br/>ask, if I may trust the well-worn cover of your guidebook. I, too,<br/>have seen them all, and heartily believe in the sincerity of your<br/>resolution, since it begins to bear fruit. Go on, dear, patiently<br/>and bravely, and always believe that no one sympathizes more<br/>tenderly with you than your loving…<br/><br/>Mother<br/><br/><br/>"That does me good! That's worth millions of money and pecks of<br/>praise. Oh, Marmee, I do try! I will keep on trying, and not get<br/>tired, since I have you to help me."<br/><br/>Laying her head on her arms, Jo wet her little romance with a<br/>few happy tears, for she had thought that no one saw and<br/>appreciated her efforts to be good, and this assurance was doubly<br/>precious, doubly encouraging, because unexpected and from the<br/>person whose commendation she most valued. Feeling stronger than<br/>ever to meet and subdue her Apollyon, she pinned the note inside<br/>her frock, as a shield and a reminder, lest she be taken unaware,<br/>and proceeded to open her other letter, quite ready for either good<br/>or bad news. In a big, dashing hand, Laurie wrote…<br/><br/><br/>Dear Jo, What ho!<br/>
