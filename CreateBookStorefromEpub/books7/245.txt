"Come, Jo, don't desert a fellow. I'm in such a state of
exhaustion I can't get home without help. Don't take off your

"Not a prank."

"And don't say funny things when we ought to be sober."

"I never do. You are the one for that."

"And I implore you not to look at me during the ceremony. I
shall certainly laugh if you do."
