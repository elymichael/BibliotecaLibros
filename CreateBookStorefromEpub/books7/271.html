<br/>"You haven't seen my private expense book yet."<br/><br/>John never asked to see it, but she always insisted on his doing<br/>so, and used to enjoy his masculine amazement at the queer things<br/>women wanted, and made him guess what piping was, demand fiercely<br/>the meaning of a hug-me-tight, or wonder how a little thing<br/>composed of three rosebuds, a bit of velvet, and a pair of strings,<br/>could possibly be a bonnet, and cost six dollars. That night he<br/>looked as if he would like the fun of quizzing her figures and<br/>pretending to be horrified at her extravagance, as he often did,<br/>being particularly proud of his prudent wife.<br/><br/>The little book was brought slowly out and laid down before him.<br/>Meg got behind his chair under pretense of smoothing the wrinkles<br/>out of his tired forehead, and standing there, she said, with her<br/>panic increasing with every word…<br/><br/>"John, dear, I'm ashamed to show you my book, for I've really<br/>been dreadfully extravagant lately. I go about so much I must have<br/>things, you know, and Sallie advised my getting it, so I did, and<br/>my New Year's money will partly pay for it, but I was sorry after I<br/>had done it, for I knew you'd think it wrong in me."<br/><br/>John laughed, and drew her round beside him, saying<br/>goodhumoredly, "Don't go and hide. I won't beat you if you have got<br/>a pair of killing boots. I'm rather proud of my wife's feet, and<br/>don't mind if she does pay eight or nine dollars for her boots, if<br/>they are good ones."<br/><br/>That had been one of her last 'trifles', and John's eye had<br/>fallen on it as he spoke. "Oh, what will he say when he comes to<br/>that awful fifty dollars!" thought Meg, with a shiver.<br/><br/>"It's worse than boots, it's a silk dress," she said, with the<br/>calmness of desperation, for she wanted the worst over.<br/><br/>"Well, dear, what is the 'dem'd total', as Mr. Mantalini<br/>says?"<br/><br/>That didn't sound like John, and she knew he was looking up at<br/>her with the straightforward look that she had always been ready to<br/>meet and answer with one as frank till now. She turned the page and<br/>her head at the same time, pointing to the sum which would have<br/>been bad enough without the fifty, but which was appalling to her<br/>with that added. For a minute the room was very still, then John<br/>said slowly—but she could feel it cost him an effort to express no<br/>displeasure—…<br/><br/>"Well, I don't know that fifty is much for a dress, with all the<br/>furbelows and notions you have to have to finish it off these<br/>days."<br/><br/>
