Mercy on us, how they did talk! first one, then the other, then<br/>all burst out together—trying to tell the history of three years in<br/>half an hour. It was fortunate that tea was at hand, to produce a<br/>lull and provide refreshment—for they would have been hoarse and<br/>faint if they had gone on much longer. Such a happy procession as<br/>filed away into the little dining room! Mr. March proudly escorted<br/>Mrs. Laurence. Mrs. March as proudly leaned on the arm of 'my son'.<br/>The old gentleman took Jo, with a whispered, "You must be my girl<br/>now," and a glance at the empty corner by the fire, that made Jo<br/>whisper back, "I'll try to fill her place, sir."<br/><br/>The twins pranced behind, feeling that the millennium was at<br/>hand, for everyone was so busy with the newcomers that they were<br/>left to revel at their own sweet will, and you may be sure they<br/>made the most of the opportunity. Didn't they steal sips of tea,<br/>stuff gingerbread ad libitum, get a hot biscuit apiece, and as a<br/>crowning trespass, didn't they each whisk a captivating little tart<br/>into their tiny pockets, there to stick and crumble treacherously,<br/>teaching them that both human nature and a pastry are frail?<br/>Burdened with the guilty consciousness of the sequestered tarts,<br/>and fearing that Dodo's sharp eyes would pierce the thin disguise<br/>of cambric and merino which hid their booty, the little sinners<br/>attached themselves to 'Dranpa', who hadn't his spectacles on. Amy,<br/>who was handed about like refreshments, returned to the parlor on<br/>Father Laurence's arm. The others paired off as before, and this<br/>arrangement left Jo companionless. She did not mind it at the<br/>minute, for she lingered to answer Hannah's eager inquiry.<br/><br/>"Will Miss Amy ride in her coop (coupe), and use all them lovely<br/>silver dishes that's stored away over yander?"<br/><br/>"Shouldn't wonder if she drove six white horses, ate off gold<br/>plate, and wore diamonds and point lace every day. Teddy thinks<br/>nothing too good for her," returned Jo with infinite<br/>satisfaction.<br/><br/>"No more there is! Will you have hash or fishballs for<br/>breakfast?" asked Hannah, who wisely mingled poetry and prose.<br/><br/>"I don't care," and Jo shut the door, feeling that food was an<br/>uncongenial topic just then. She stood a minute looking at the<br/>party vanishing above, and as Demi's short plaid legs toiled up the<br/>last stair, a sudden sense of loneliness came over her so strongly<br/>that she looked about her with dim eyes, as if to find something to<br/>lean upon, for even Teddy had deserted her. If she had known what<br/>birthday gift was coming every minute nearer and nearer, she would<br/>not have said to herself, "I'll weep a little weep when I go to<br/>bed. It won't do to be dismal now." Then she drew her hand over her<br/>eyes, for one of her boyish habits was never to know where her<br/>handkerchief was, and had just managed to call up a smile when<br/>there came a knock at the porch door.<br/><br/>She opened with hospitable haste, and started as if another<br/>ghost had come to surprise her, for there stood a tall bearded<br/>gentleman, beaming on her from the darkness like a midnight<br/>sun.<br/><br/>"Oh, Mr. Bhaer, I am so glad to see you!" cried Jo, with a<br/>clutch, as if she feared the night would swallow him up before she<br/>could get him in.<br/><br/>"And I to see Miss Marsch, but no, you haf a party," and the<br/>Professor paused as the sound of voices and the tap of dancing feet<br/>came down to them.<br/><br/>"No, we haven't, only the family. My sister and friends have<br/>just come home, and we are all very happy. Come in, and make one of<br/>us."<br/><br/>Though a very social man, I think Mr. Bhaer would have gone<br/>decorously away, and come again another day, but how could he, when<br/>Jo shut the door behind him, and bereft him of his hat? Perhaps her<br/>face had something to do with it, for she forgot to hide her joy at<br/>seeing him, and showed it with a frankness that proved irresistible<br/>to the solitary man, whose welcome far exceeded his boldest<br/>hopes.<br/>
