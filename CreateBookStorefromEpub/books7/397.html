You've grown bigger and bonnier,<br/>but you are the same scapegrace as ever."<br/><br/>"Now really, Jo, you ought to treat me with more respect," began<br/>Laurie, who enjoyed it all immensely.<br/><br/>"How can I, when the mere idea of you, married and settled, is<br/>so irresistibly funny that I can't keep sober!" answered Jo,<br/>smiling all over her face, so infectiously that they had another<br/>laugh, and then settled down for a good talk, quite in the pleasant<br/>old fashion.<br/><br/>"It's no use your going out in the cold to get Amy, for they are<br/>all coming up presently.
