<br/>"I like to please Laurie, and I'm not afraid of Mr. Brooke, he<br/>is so kind. But I don't want to play, or sing, or say anything.<br/>I'll work hard and not trouble anyone, and you'll take care of me,<br/>Jo, so I'll go."<br/><br/>"That's my good girl. You do try to fight off your shyness, and<br/>I love you for it. Fighting faults isn't easy, as I know, and a<br/>cheery word kind of gives a lift. Thank you, Mother," And Jo gave<br/>the thin cheek a grateful kiss, more precious to Mrs. March than if<br/>it had given back the rosy roundness of her youth.<br/><br/>"I had a box of chocolate drops, and the picture I wanted to<br/>copy," said Amy, showing her mail.<br/><br/>"And I got a note from Mr. Laurence, asking me to come over and<br/>play to him tonight, before the lamps are lighted, and I shall go,"<br/>added Beth, whose friendship with the old gentleman prospered<br/>finely.<br/><br/>"Now let's fly round, and do double duty today, so that we can<br/>play tomorrow with free minds," said Jo, preparing to replace her<br/>pen with a broom.<br/><br/>When the sun peeped into the girls' room early next morning to<br/>promise them a fine day, he saw a comical sight. Each had made such<br/>preparation for the fete as seemed necessary and proper. Meg had an<br/>extra row of little curlpapers across her forehead, Jo had<br/>copiously anointed her afflicted face with cold cream, Beth had<br/>taken Joanna to bed with her to atone for the approaching<br/>separation, and Amy had capped the climax by putting a clothespin<br/>on her nose to uplift the offending feature. It was one of the kind<br/>artists use to hold the paper on their drawing boards, therefore<br/>quite appropriate and effective for the purpose it was now being<br/>put. This funny spectacle appeared to amuse the sun, for he burst<br/>out with such radiance that Jo woke up and roused her sisters by a<br/>hearty laugh at Amy's ornament.<br/><br/>Sunshine and laughter were good omens for a pleasure party, and<br/>soon a lively bustle began in both houses. Beth, who was ready<br/>first, kept reporting what went on next door, and enlivened her<br/>sisters' toilets by frequent telegrams from the window.<br/><br/>"There goes the man with the tent! I see Mrs. Barker doing up<br/>the lunch in a hamper and a great basket. Now Mr. Laurence is<br/>looking up at the sky and the weathercock. I wish he would go too.<br/>There's Laurie, looking like a sailor, nice boy! Oh, mercy me!<br/>Here's a carriage full of people, a tall lady, a little girl, and<br/>two dreadful boys. One is lame, poor thing, he's got a crutch.<br/>Laurie didn't tell us that. Be quick, girls! It's getting late.<br/>Why, there is Ned Moffat, I do declare. Meg, isn't that the man who<br/>bowed to you one day when we were shopping?"<br/><br/>"So it is. How queer that he should come. I thought he was at<br/>the mountains. There is Sallie. I'm glad she got back in time. Am I<br/>all right, Jo?" cried Meg in a flutter.<br/><br/>"A regular daisy. Hold up your dress and put your hat on<br/>straight, it looks sentimental tipped that way and will fly off at<br/>the first puff. Now then, come on!"<br/><br/>
