"Don't think of me at all. I'd rather you wouldn't," said Meg,<br/>taking a naughty satisfaction in trying her lover's patience and<br/>her own power.<br/><br/>He was grave and pale now, and looked decidedly more like the<br/>novel heroes whom she admired, but he neither slapped his forehead<br/>nor tramped about the room as they did. He just stood looking at<br/>her so wistfully, so tenderly, that she found her heart relenting<br/>in spite of herself. What would have happened next I cannot say, if<br/>Aunt March had not come hobbling in at this interesting minute.<br/><br/>The old lady couldn't resist her longing to see her nephew, for<br/>she had met Laurie as she took her airing, and hearing of Mr.<br/>March's arrival, drove straight out to see him. The family were all<br/>busy in the back part of the house, and she had made her way<br/>quietly in, hoping to surprise them. She did surprise two of them<br/>so much that Meg started as if she had seen a ghost, and Mr. Brooke<br/>vanished into the study.<br/><br/>"Bless me, what's all this?" cried the old lady with a rap of<br/>her cane as she glanced from the pale young gentleman to the<br/>scarlet young lady.<br/><br/>"It's Father's friend. I'm so surprised to see you!" stammered<br/>Meg, feeling that she was in for a lecture now.<br/><br/>"That's evident," returned Aunt March, sitting down. "But what<br/>is Father's friend saying to make you look like a peony? There's<br/>mischief going on, and I insist upon knowing what it is," with<br/>another rap.<br/><br/>"We were only talking. Mr. Brooke came for his umbrella," began<br/>Meg, wishing that Mr. Brooke and the umbrella were safely out of<br/>the house.<br/><br/>"Brooke? That boy's tutor? Ah! I understand now. I know all<br/>about it. Jo blundered into a wrong message in one of your Father's<br/>letters, and I made her tell me. You haven't gone and accepted him,<br/>child?" cried Aunt March, looking scandalized.<br/><br/>"Hush! He'll hear. Shan't I call Mother?" said Meg, much<br/>troubled.<br/><br/>"Not yet. I've something to say to you, and I must free my mind<br/>at once. Tell me, do you mean to marry this Cook? If you do, not<br/>one penny of my money ever goes to you. Remember that, and be a<br/>sensible girl," said the old lady impressively.<br/><br/>Now Aunt March possessed in perfection the art of rousing the<br/>spirit of opposition in the gentlest people, and enjoyed doing it.<br/>The best of us have a spice of perversity in us, especially when we<br/>are young and in love. If Aunt March had begged Meg to accept John<br/>Brooke, she would probably have declared she couldn't think of it,<br/>but as she was preemptorily ordered not to like him, she<br/>immediately made up her mind that she would. Inclination as well as<br/>perversity made the decision easy, and being already much excited,<br/>Meg opposed the old lady with unusual spirit.<br/>
