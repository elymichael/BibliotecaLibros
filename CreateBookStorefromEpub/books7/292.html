<br/>Much gratified, Jo rushed back to tell the good news, and Amy<br/>looked both touched and surprised by the report of May's word and<br/>manner.<br/><br/>"Now, gentlemen, I want you to go and do your duty by the other<br/>tables as generously as you have by mine, especially the art<br/>table," she said, ordering out 'Teddy's own', as the girls called<br/>the college friends.<br/><br/>"'Charge, Chester, charge!' is the motto for that table, but do<br/>your duty like men, and you'll get your money's worth of art in<br/>every sense of the word," said the irrepressible Jo, as the devoted<br/>phalanx prepared to take the field.<br/><br/>"To hear is to obey, but March is fairer far than May," said<br/>little Parker, making a frantic effort to be both witty and tender,<br/>and getting promptly quenched by Laurie, who saidâ€¦<br/><br/>"Very well, my son, for a small boy!" and walked him off, with a<br/>paternal pat on the head.<br/><br/>"Buy the vases," whispered Amy to Laurie, as a final heaping of<br/>coals of fire on her enemy's head.<br/><br/>To May's great delight, Mr. Laurence not only bought the vases,<br/>but pervaded the hall with one under each arm. The other gentlemen<br/>speculated with equal rashness in all sorts of frail trifles, and<br/>wandered helplessly about afterward, burdened with wax flowers,<br/>painted fans, filigree portfolios, and other useful and appropriate<br/>purchases.<br/><br/>Aunt Carrol was there, heard the story, looked pleased, and said<br/>something to Mrs. March in a corner, which made the latter lady<br/>beam with satisfaction, and watch Amy with a face full of mingled<br/>pride and anxiety, though she did not betray the cause of her<br/>pleasure till several days later.<br/><br/>The fair was pronounced a success, and when May bade Amy<br/>goodnight, she did not gush as usual, but gave her an affectionate<br/>kiss, and a look which said 'forgive and forget'. That satisfied<br/>Amy, and when she got home she found the vases paraded on the<br/>parlor chimney piece with a great bouquet in each. "The reward of<br/>merit for a magnanimous March," as Laurie announced with a<br/>flourish.<br/><br/>"You've a deal more principle and generosity and nobleness of<br/>character than I ever gave you credit for, Amy. You've behaved<br/>sweetly, and I respect you with all my heart," said Jo warmly, as<br/>they brushed their hair together late that night.<br/><br/>
