<br/>"Didn't you feel dreadfully when the first cut came?" asked Meg,<br/>with a shiver.<br/><br/>"I took a last look at my hair while the man got his things, and<br/>that was the end of it. I never snivel over trifles like that. I<br/>will confess, though, I felt queer when I saw the dear old hair<br/>laid out on the table, and felt only the short rough ends of my<br/>head. It almost seemed as if I'd an arm or leg off. The woman saw<br/>me look at it, and picked out a long lock for me to keep. I'll give<br/>it to you, Marmee, just to remember past glories by, for a crop is<br/>so comfortable I don't think I shall ever have a mane again."<br/><br/>Mrs. March folded the wavy chestnut lock, and laid it away with<br/>a short gray one in her desk. She only said, "Thank you, deary,"<br/>but something in her face made the girls change the subject, and<br/>talk as cheerfully as they could about Mr. Brooke's kindness, the<br/>prospect of a fine day tomorrow, and the happy times they would<br/>have when Father came home to be nursed.<br/><br/>No one wanted to go to bed when at ten o'clock Mrs. March put by<br/>the last finished job, and said, "Come girls." Beth went to the<br/>piano and played the father's favorite hymn. All began bravely, but<br/>broke down one by one till Beth was left alone, singing with all<br/>her heart, for to her music was always a sweet consoler.<br/><br/>"Go to bed and don't talk, for we must be up early and shall<br/>need all the sleep we can get. Good night, my darlings," said Mrs.<br/>March, as the hymn ended, for no one cared to try another.<br/><br/>They kissed her quietly, and went to bed as silently as if the<br/>dear invalid lay in the next room. Beth and Amy soon fell asleep in<br/>spite of the great trouble, but Meg lay awake, thinking the most<br/>serious thoughts she had ever known in her short life. Jo lay<br/>motionless, and her sister fancied that she was asleep, till a<br/>stifled sob made her exclaim, as she touched a wet cheek…<br/><br/>"Jo, dear, what is it? Are you crying about father?"<br/><br/>"No, not now."<br/><br/>"What then?"<br/><br/>"My… My hair!" burst out poor Jo, trying vainly to smother her<br/>emotion in the pillow.<br/><br/>
