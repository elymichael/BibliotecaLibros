The Laurence Boy


"Jo! Jo! Where are you?" cried Meg at the foot of the garret
stairs.

"Here!" answered a husky voice from above, and, running up, Meg
found her sister eating apples and crying over the Heir of
Redclyffe, wrapped up in a comforter on an old three-legged sofa by
the sunny window. This was Jo's favorite refuge, and here she loved
to retire with half a dozen russets and a nice book, to enjoy the
quiet and the society of a pet rat who lived near by and didn't
mind her a particle. As Meg appeared, Scrabble whisked into his
hole. Jo shook the tears off her cheeks and waited to hear the
news.

"Such fun! Only see! A regular note of invitation from Mrs.
Gardiner for tomorrow night!" cried Meg, waving the precious paper
and then proceeding to read it with girlish delight.

"'Mrs. Gardiner would be happy to see Miss March and Miss
Josephine at a little dance on New Year's Eve.' Marmee is willing
we should go, now what shall we wear?"

"What's the use of asking that, when you know we shall wear our
poplins, because we haven't got anything else?" answered Jo with
her mouth full.

"If I only had a silk!" sighed Meg. "Mother says I may when I'm
eighteen perhaps, but two years is an everlasting time to
wait."

"I'm sure our pops look like silk, and they are nice enough for
us. Yours is as good as new, but I forgot the burn and the tear in
mine. Whatever shall I do? The burn shows badly, and I can't take
any out."
