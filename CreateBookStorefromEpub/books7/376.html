He looked and then he smiled, as he could not well help doing,<br/>for it was capitally done, the long, lazy figure on the grass, with<br/>listless face, half-shut eyes, and one hand holding a cigar, from<br/>which came the little wreath of smoke that encircled the dreamer's<br/>head.<br/><br/>"How well you draw!" he said, with a genuine surprise and<br/>pleasure at her skill, adding, with a half-laugh, "Yes, that's<br/>me."<br/><br/>"As you are. This is as you were." and Amy laid another sketch<br/>beside the one he held.<br/><br/>It was not nearly so well done, but there was a life and spirit<br/>in it which atoned for many faults, and it recalled the past so<br/>vividly that a sudden change swept over the young man's face as he<br/>looked. Only a rough sketch of Laurie taming a horse. Hat and coat<br/>were off, and every line of the active figure, resolute face, and<br/>commanding attitude was full of energy and meaning. The handsome<br/>brute, just subdued, stood arching his neck under the tightly drawn<br/>rein, with one foot impatiently pawing the ground, and ears pricked<br/>up as if listening for the voice that had mastered him. In the<br/>ruffled mane, the rider's breezy hair and erect attitude, there was<br/>a suggestion of suddenly arrested motion, of strength, courage, and<br/>youthful buoyancy that contrasted sharply with the supine grace of<br/>the '<br/>Dolce far Niente<br/>' sketch. Laurie said nothing but as<br/>his eye went from one to the other, Amy saw him flush up and fold<br/>his lips together as if he read and accepted the little lesson she<br/>had given him. That satisfied her, and without waiting for him to<br/>speak, she said, in her sprightly way…<br/><br/>"Don't you remember the day you played Rarey with Puck, and we<br/>all looked on? Meg and Beth were frightened, but Jo clapped and<br/>pranced, and I sat on the fence and drew you. I found that sketch<br/>in my portfolio the other day, touched it up, and kept it to show<br/>you."<br/><br/>"Much obliged. You've improved immensely since then, and I<br/>congratulate you. May I venture to suggest in 'a honeymoon<br/>paradise' that five o'clock is the dinner hour at your hotel?"<br/><br/>Laurie rose as he spoke, returned the pictures with a smile and<br/>a bow and looked at his watch, as if to remind her that even moral<br/>lectures should have an end. He tried to resume his former easy,<br/>indifferent air, but it was an affectation now, for the rousing had<br/>been more effacious than he would confess. Amy felt the shade of<br/>coldness in his manner, and said to herself…<br/><br/>"Now, I've offended him. Well, if it does him good, I'm glad, if<br/>it makes him hate me, I'm sorry, but it's true, and I can't take<br/>back a word of it."<br/><br/>They laughed and chatted all the way home, and little Baptiste,<br/>up behind, thought that monsieur and madamoiselle were in charming<br/>spirits. But both felt ill at ease. The friendly frankness was<br/>disturbed, the sunshine had a shadow over it, and despite their<br/>apparent gaiety, there was a secret discontent in the heart of<br/>each.<br/><br/>"Shall we see you this evening, mon frere?" asked Amy, as they<br/>parted at her aunt's door.<br/>
