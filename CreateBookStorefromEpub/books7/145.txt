"Why don't you say you'd have a splendid, wise, good husband and
some angelic little children? You know your castle wouldn't be
perfect without," said blunt Jo, who had no tender fancies yet, and
rather scorned romance, except in books.

"You'd have nothing but horses, inkstands, and novels in yours,"
answered Meg petulantly.

"Wouldn't I though? I'd have a stable full of Arabian steeds,
rooms piled high with books, and I'd write out of a magic inkstand,
so that my works should be as famous as Laurie's music. I want to
do something splendid before I go into my castle, something heroic
or wonderful that won't be forgotten after I'm dead. I don't know
what, but I'm on the watch for it, and mean to astonish you all
some day. I think I shall write books, and get rich and famous,
that would suit me, so that is my favorite dream."

"Mine is to stay at home safe with Father and Mother, and help
take care of the family," said Beth contentedly.

"Don't you wish for anything else?" asked Laurie.

"Since I had my little piano, I am perfectly satisfied. I only
wish we may all keep well and be together, nothing else."

"I have ever so many wishes, but the pet one is to be an artist,
and go to Rome, and do fine pictures, and be the best artist in the
whole world," was Amy's modest desire.

"We're an ambitious set, aren't we? Every one of us, but Beth,
wants to be rich and famous, and gorgeous in every respect. I do
wonder if any of us will ever get our wishes," said Laurie, chewing
grass like a meditative calf.

"I've got the key to my castle in the air, but whether I can
unlock the door remains to be seen," observed Jo mysteriously.

"I've got the key to mine, but I'm not allowed to try it. Hang
college!" muttered Laurie with an impatient sigh.
