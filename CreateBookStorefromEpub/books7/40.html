<br/>Jo happened to suit Aunt March, who was lame and needed an<br/>active person to wait upon her. The childless old lady had offered<br/>to adopt one of the girls when the troubles came, and was much<br/>offended because her offer was declined. Other friends told the<br/>Marches that they had lost all chance of being remembered in the<br/>rich old lady's will, but the unworldly Marches only saidâ€¦<br/><br/>"We can't give up our girls for a dozen fortunes. Rich or poor,<br/>we will keep together and be happy in one another."<br/><br/>The old lady wouldn't speak to them for a time, but happening to<br/>meet Jo at a friend's, something in her comical face and blunt<br/>manners struck the old lady's fancy, and she proposed to take her<br/>for a companion. This did not suit Jo at all, but she accepted the<br/>place since nothing better appeared and, to every one's surprise,<br/>got on remarkably well with her irascible relative. There was an<br/>occasional tempest, and once Jo marched home, declaring she<br/>couldn't bear it longer, but Aunt March always cleared up quickly,<br/>and sent for her to come back again with such urgency that she<br/>could not refuse, for in her heart she rather liked the peppery old<br/>lady.<br/><br/>I suspect that the real attraction was a large library of fine<br/>books, which was left to dust and spiders since Uncle March died.<br/>Jo remembered the kind old gentleman, who used to let her build<br/>railroads and bridges with his big dictionaries, tell her stories<br/>about queer pictures in his Latin books, and buy her cards of<br/>gingerbread whenever he met her in the street. The dim, dusty room,<br/>with the busts staring down from the tall bookcases, the cozy<br/>chairs, the globes, and best of all, the wilderness of books in<br/>which she could wander where she liked, made the library a region<br/>of bliss to her.<br/><br/>The moment Aunt March took her nap, or was busy with company, Jo<br/>hurried to this quiet place, and curling herself up in the easy<br/>chair, devoured poetry, romance, history, travels, and pictures<br/>like a regular bookworm. But, like all happiness, it did not last<br/>long, for as sure as she had just reached the heart of the story,<br/>the sweetest verse of a song, or the most perilous adventure of her<br/>traveler, a shrill voice called, "Josy-phine! Josy-phine!" and she<br/>had to leave her paradise to wind yarn, wash the poodle, or read<br/>Belsham's Essays by the hour together.<br/><br/>Jo's ambition was to do something very splendid. What it was,<br/>she had no idea as yet, but left it for time to tell her, and<br/>meanwhile, found her greatest affliction in the fact that she<br/>couldn't read, run, and ride as much as she liked. A quick temper,<br/>sharp tongue, and restless spirit were always getting her into<br/>scrapes, and her life was a series of ups and downs, which were<br/>both comic and pathetic. But the training she received at Aunt<br/>March's was just what she needed, and the thought that she was<br/>doing something to support herself made her happy in spite of the<br/>perpetual "Josy-phine!"<br/><br/>Beth was too bashful to go to school. It had been tried, but she<br/>suffered so much that it was given up, and she did her lessons at<br/>home with her father. Even when he went away, and her mother was<br/>called to devote her skill and energy to Soldiers' Aid Societies,<br/>Beth went faithfully on by herself and did the best she could. She<br/>was a housewifely little creature, and helped Hannah keep home neat<br/>and comfortable for the workers, never thinking of any reward but<br/>to be loved. Long, quiet days she spent, not lonely nor idle, for<br/>her little world was peopled with imaginary friends, and she was by<br/>nature a busy bee. There were six dolls to be taken up and dressed<br/>every morning, for Beth was a child still and loved her pets as<br/>well as ever. Not one whole or handsome one among them, all were<br/>outcasts till Beth took them in, for when her sisters outgrew these<br/>idols, they passed to her because Amy would have nothing old or<br/>ugly. Beth cherished them all the more tenderly for that very<br/>reason, and set up a hospital for infirm dolls. No pins were ever<br/>stuck into their cotton vitals, no harsh words or blows were ever<br/>given them, no neglect ever saddened the heart of the most<br/>repulsive, but all were fed and clothed, nursed and caressed with<br/>an affection which never failed. One forlorn fragment of dollanity<br/>had belonged to Jo and, having led a tempestuous life, was left a<br/>wreck in the rag bag, from which dreary poorhouse it was rescued by<br/>Beth and taken to her refuge. Having no top to its head, she tied<br/>on a neat little cap, and as both arms and legs were gone, she hid<br/>these deficiencies by folding it in a blanket and devoting her best<br/>bed to this chronic invalid. If anyone had known the care lavished<br/>on that dolly, I think it would have touched their hearts, even<br/>while they laughed. She brought it bits of bouquets, she read to<br/>it, took it out to breathe fresh air, hidden under her coat, she<br/>sang it lullabies and never went to bed without kissing its dirty<br/>face and whispering tenderly, "I hope you'll have a good night, my<br/>poor dear."<br/><br/>Beth had her troubles as well as the others, and not being an<br/>angel but a very human little girl, she often 'wept a little weep'<br/>as Jo said, because she couldn't take music lessons and have a fine<br/>piano. She loved music so dearly, tried so hard to learn, and<br/>practiced away so patiently at the jingling old instrument, that it<br/>did seem as if someone (not to hint Aunt March) ought to help her.<br/>Nobody did, however, and nobody saw Beth wipe the tears off the<br/>yellow keys, that wouldn't keep in tune, when she was all alone.<br/>She sang like a little lark about her work, never was too tired for<br/>Marmee and the girls, and day after day said hopefully to herself,<br/>"I know I'll get my music some time, if I'm good."<br/><br/>There are many Beths in the world, shy and quiet, sitting in<br/>corners till needed, and living for others so cheerfully that no<br/>one sees the sacrifices till the little cricket on the hearth stops<br/>chirping, and the sweet, sunshiny presence vanishes, leaving<br/>silence and shadow behind.<br/><br/>If anybody had asked Amy what the greatest trial of her life<br/>was, she would have answered at once, "My nose." When she was a<br/>baby, Jo had accidently dropped her into the coal hod, and Amy<br/>insisted that the fall had ruined her nose forever. It was not big<br/>nor red, like poor 'Petrea's', it was only rather flat, and all the<br/>pinching in the world could not give it an aristocratic point. No<br/>one minded it but herself, and it was doing its best to grow, but<br/>Amy felt deeply the want of a Grecian nose, and drew whole sheets<br/>of handsome ones to console herself.<br/><br/>
