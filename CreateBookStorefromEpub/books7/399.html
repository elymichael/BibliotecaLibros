<br/>"I'll believe it, with all my heart, but, Teddy, we never can be<br/>boy and girl again. The happy old times can't come back, and we<br/>mustn't expect it. We are man and woman now, with sober work to do,<br/>for playtime is over, and we must give up frolicking. I'm sure you<br/>feel this. I see the change in you, and you'll find it in me. I<br/>shall miss my boy, but I shall love the man as much, and admire him<br/>more, because he means to be what I hoped he would. We can't be<br/>little playmates any longer, but we will be brother and sister, to<br/>love and help one another all our lives, won't we, Laurie?"<br/><br/>He did not say a word, but took the hand she offered him, and<br/>laid his face down on it for a minute, feeling that out of the<br/>grave of a boyish passion, there had risen a beautiful, strong<br/>friendship to bless them both. Presently Jo said cheerfully, for<br/>she didn't want the coming home to be a sad one, "I can't make it<br/>true that you children are really married and going to set up<br/>housekeeping. Why, it seems only yesterday that I was buttoning<br/>Amy's pinafore, and pulling your hair when you teased. Mercy me,<br/>how time does fly!"<br/><br/>"As one of the children is older than yourself, you needn't talk<br/>so like a grandma. I flatter myself I'm a 'gentleman growed' as<br/>Peggotty said of David, and when you see Amy, you'll find her<br/>rather a precocious infant," said Laurie, looking amused at her<br/>maternal air.<br/><br/>"You may be a little older in years, but I'm ever so much older<br/>in feeling, Teddy. Women always are, and this last year has been<br/>such a hard one that I feel forty."<br/><br/>"Poor Jo! We left you to bear it alone, while we went<br/>pleasuring. You are older. Here's a line, and there's another.<br/>Unless you smile, your eyes look sad, and when I touched the<br/>cushion, just now, I found a tear on it. You've had a great deal to<br/>bear, and had to bear it all alone. What a selfish beast I've<br/>been!" and Laurie pulled his own hair, with a remorseful look.<br/><br/>But Jo only turned over the traitorous pillow, and answered, in<br/>a tone which she tried to make more cheerful, "No, I had Father and<br/>Mother to help me, and the dear babies to comfort me, and the<br/>thought that you and Amy were safe and happy, to make the troubles<br/>here easier to bear. I am lonely, sometimes, but I dare say it's<br/>good for me, andâ€¦ "<br/><br/>"You never shall be again," broke in Laurie, putting his arm<br/>about her, as if to fence out every human ill. "Amy and I can't get<br/>on without you, so you must come and teach 'the children' to keep<br/>house, and go halves in everything, just as we used to do, and let<br/>us pet you, and all be blissfully happy and friendly together."<br/><br/>"If I shouldn't be in the way, it would be very pleasant. I<br/>begin to feel quite young already, for somehow all my troubles<br/>seemed to fly away when you came. You always were a comfort,<br/>Teddy," and Jo leaned her head on his shoulder, just as she did<br/>years ago, when Beth lay ill and Laurie told her to hold on to<br/>him.<br/><br/>He looked down at her, wondering if she remembered the time, but<br/>Jo was smiling to herself, as if in truth her troubles had all<br/>vanished at his coming.<br/><br/>"You are the same Jo still, dropping tears about one minute, and<br/>laughing the next. You look a little wicked now. What is it,<br/>Grandma?"<br/><br/>
