<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>10<br/>Jo’s Journal<br/><br/><br/><br/>New York, November<br/><br/>Dear Marmee and Beth,<br/><br/>I'm going to write you a regular volume, for I've<br/>got heaps to tell, though I'm not a fine young lady traveling on<br/>the continent. When I lost sight of Father's dear old face, I felt<br/>a trifle blue, and might have shed a briny drop or two, if an Irish<br/>lady with four small children, all crying more or less, hadn't<br/>diverted my mind, for I amused myself by dropping gingerbread nuts<br/>over the seat every time they opened their mouths to roar.<br/><br/>Soon the sun came out, and taking it as a good<br/>omen, I cleared up likewise and enjoyed my journey with all my<br/>heart.<br/><br/>Mrs. Kirke welcomed me so kindly I felt at home<br/>at once, even in that big house full of strangers. She gave me a<br/>funny little sky parlor—all she had, but there is a stove in it,<br/>and a nice table in a sunny window, so I can sit here and write<br/>whenever I like. A fine view and a church tower opposite atone for<br/>the many stairs, and I took a fancy to my den on the spot. The<br/>nursery, where I am to teach and sew, is a pleasant room next Mrs.<br/>Kirke's private parlor, and the two little girls are pretty<br/>children, rather spoiled, I fancy, but they took to me after<br/>telling them The Seven Bad Pigs, and I've no doubt I shall make a<br/>model governess.<br/><br/>I am to have my meals with the children, if I<br/>prefer it to the great table, and for the present I do, for I am<br/>bashful, though no one will believe it.<br/><br/>
