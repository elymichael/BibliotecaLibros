"Bless you! He won't do that."

"I won't go down till he does."

"Now, Teddy, be sensible. Let it pass, and I'll explain what I
can. You can't stay here, so what's the use of being
melodramatic?"

"I don't intend to stay here long, anyway. I'll slip off and
take a journey somewhere, and when Grandpa misses me he'll come
round fast enough."

"I dare say, but you ought not to go and worry him."

"Don't preach. I'll go to Washington and see Brooke. It's gay
there, and I'll enjoy myself after the troubles."

"What fun you'd have! I wish I could run off too," said Jo,
forgetting her part of mentor in lively visions of martial life at
the capital.

"Come on, then! Why not? You go and surprise your father, and
I'll stir up old Brooke. It would be a glorious joke. Let's do it,
Jo. We'll leave a letter saying we are all right, and trot off at
once. I've got money enough. It will do you good, and no harm, as
you go to your father."

For a moment Jo looked as if she would agree, for wild as the
plan was, it just suited her. She was tired of care and
confinement, longed for change, and thoughts of her father blended
temptingly with the novel charms of camps and hospitals, liberty
and fun. Her eyes kindled as they turned wistfully toward the
window, but they fell on the old house opposite, and she shook her
head with sorrowful decision.

"If I was a boy, we'd run away together, and have a capital
time, but as I'm a miserable girl, I must be proper and stop at
home. Don't tempt me, Teddy, it's a crazy plan."
