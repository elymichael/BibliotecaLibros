<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>19<br/>All Alone<br/><br/><br/>It was easy to promise self-abnegation when self was wrapped up<br/>in another, and heart and soul were purified by a sweet example.<br/>But when the helpful voice was silent, the daily lesson over, the<br/>beloved presence gone, and nothing remained but loneliness and<br/>grief, then Jo found her promise very hard to keep. How could she<br/>'comfort Father and Mother' when her own heart ached with a<br/>ceaseless longing for her sister, how could she 'make the house<br/>cheerful' when all its light and warmth and beauty seemed to have<br/>deserted it when Beth left the old home for the new, and where in<br/>all the world could she 'find some useful, happy work to do', that<br/>would take the place of the loving service which had been its own<br/>reward? She tried in a blind, hopeless way to do her duty, secretly<br/>rebelling against it all the while, for it seemed unjust that her<br/>few joys should be lessened, her burdens made heavier, and life get<br/>harder and harder as she toiled along. Some people seemed to get<br/>all sunshine, and some all shadow. It was not fair, for she tried<br/>more than Amy to be good, but never got any reward, only<br/>disappointment, trouble and hard work.<br/><br/>Poor Jo, these were dark days to her, for something like despair<br/>came over her when she thought of spending all her life in that<br/>quiet house, devoted to humdrum cares, a few small pleasures, and<br/>the duty that never seemed to grow any easier. "I can't do it. I<br/>wasn't meant for a life like this, and I know I shall break away<br/>and do something desperate if somebody doesn't come and help me,"<br/>she said to herself, when her first efforts failed and she fell<br/>into the moody, miserable state of mind which often comes when<br/>strong wills have to yield to the inevitable.<br/><br/>But someone did come and help her, though Jo did not recognize<br/>her good angels at once because they wore familiar shapes and used<br/>the simple spells best fitted to poor humanity. Often she started<br/>up at night, thinking Beth called her, and when the sight of the<br/>little empty bed made her cry with the bitter cry of unsubmissive<br/>sorrow, "Oh, Beth, come back! Come back!" she did not stretch out<br/>her yearning arms in vain. For, as quick to hear her sobbing as she<br/>had been to hear her sister's faintest whisper, her mother came to<br/>comfort her, not with words only, but the patient tenderness that<br/>soothes by a touch, tears that were mute reminders of a greater<br/>grief than Jo's, and broken whispers, more eloquent than prayers,<br/>because hopeful resignation went hand-in-hand with natural sorrow.<br/>Sacred moments, when heart talked to heart in the silence of the<br/>night, turning affliction to a blessing, which chastened grief and<br/>strengthned love. Feeling this, Jo's burden seemed easier to bear,<br/>duty grew sweeter, and life looked more endurable, seen from the<br/>safe shelter of her mother's arms.<br/><br/>When aching heart was a little comforted, troubled mind likewise<br/>found help, for one day she went to the study, and leaning over the<br/>good gray head lifted to welcome her with a tranquil smile, she<br/>said very humbly, "Father, talk to me as you did to Beth. I need it<br/>more than she did, for I'm all wrong."<br/><br/>"My dear, nothing can comfort me like this," he answered, with a<br/>falter in his voice, and both arms round her, as if he too, needed<br/>help, and did not fear to ask for it.<br/><br/>Then, sitting in Beth's little chair close beside him, Jo told<br/>her troubles, the resentful sorrow for her loss, the fruitless<br/>efforts that discouraged her, the want of faith that made life look<br/>so dark, and all the sad bewilderment which we call despair. She<br/>gave him entire confidence, he gave her the help she needed, and<br/>both found consolation in the act. For the time had come when they<br/>could talk together not only as father and daughter, but as man and<br/>woman, able and glad to serve each other with mutual sympathy as<br/>well as mutual love. Happy, thoughtful times there in the old study<br/>which Jo called 'the church of one member', and from which she came<br/>with fresh courage, recovered cheerfulness, and a more submissive<br/>spirit. For the parents who had taught one child to meet death<br/>without fear, were trying now to teach another to accept life<br/>without despondency or distrust, and to use its beautiful<br/>opportunities with gratitude and power.<br/><br/>Other helps had Jo—humble, wholesome duties and delights that<br/>would not be denied their part in serving her, and which she slowly<br/>learned to see and value. Brooms and dishcloths never could be as<br/>distasteful as they once had been, for Beth had presided over both,<br/>and something of her housewifely spirit seemed to linger around the<br/>little mop and the old brush, never thrown away. As she used them,<br/>Jo found herself humming the songs Beth used to hum, imitating<br/>Beth's orderly ways, and giving the little touches here and there<br/>that kept everything fresh and cozy, which was the first step<br/>toward making home happy, though she didn't know it till Hannah<br/>said with an approving squeeze of the hand…<br/>
