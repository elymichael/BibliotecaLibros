<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>9<br/>Meg Goes to Vanity Fair<br/><br/><br/>"I do think it was the most fortunate thing in the world that<br/>those children should have the measles just now," said Meg, one<br/>April day, as she stood packing the 'go abroady' trunk in her room,<br/>surrounded by her sisters.<br/><br/>"And so nice of Annie Moffat not to forget her promise. A whole<br/>fortnight of fun will be regularly splendid," replied Jo, looking<br/>like a windmill as she folded skirts with her long arms.<br/><br/>"And such lovely weather, I'm so glad of that," added Beth,<br/>tidily sorting neck and hair ribbons in her best box, lent for the<br/>great occasion.<br/><br/>"I wish I was going to have a fine time and wear all these nice<br/>things," said Amy with her mouth full of pins, as she artistically<br/>replenished her sister's cushion.<br/><br/>"I wish you were all going, but as you can't, I shall keep my<br/>adventures to tell you when I come back. I'm sure it's the least I<br/>can do when you have been so kind, lending me things and helping me<br/>get ready," said Meg, glancing round the room at the very simple<br/>outfit, which seemed nearly perfect in their eyes.<br/><br/>"What did Mother give you out of the treasure box?" asked Amy,<br/>who had not been present at the opening of a certain cedar chest in<br/>which Mrs. March kept a few relics of past splendor, as gifts for<br/>her girls when the proper time came.<br/><br/>"A pair of silk stockings, that pretty carved fan, and a lovely<br/>blue sash. I wanted the violet silk, but there isn't time to make<br/>it over, so I must be contented with my old tarlaton."<br/>
