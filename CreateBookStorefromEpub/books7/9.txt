"I thought I'd get her some with my dollar," said Beth.

"No, I shall!" cried Amy.

"I'm the oldest," began Meg, but Jo cut in with a decided, "I'm
the man of the family now Papa is away, and I shall provide the
slippers, for he told me to take special care of Mother while he
was gone."

"I'll tell you what we'll do," said Beth, "let's each get her
something for Christmas, and not get anything for ourselves."

"That's like you, dear! What will we get?" exclaimed Jo.

Everyone thought soberly for a minute, then Meg announced, as if
the idea was suggested by the sight of her own pretty hands, "I
shall give her a nice pair of gloves."

"Army shoes, best to be had," cried Jo.

"Some handkerchiefs, all hemmed," said Beth.

"I'll get a little bottle of cologne. She likes it, and it won't
cost much, so I'll have some left to buy my pencils," added
Amy.

"How will we give the things?" asked Meg.

"Put them on the table, and bring her in and see her open the
bundles. Don't you remember how we used to do on our birthdays?"
answered Jo.
