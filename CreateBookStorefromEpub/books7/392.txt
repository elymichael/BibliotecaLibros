"How sharp you are, Marmee, and how silent! You never said a
word to me."

"Mothers have need of sharp eyes and discreet tongues when they
have girls to manage. I was half afraid to put the idea into your
head, lest you should write and congratulate them before the thing
was settled."

"I'm not the scatterbrain I was. You may trust me. I'm sober and
sensible enough for anyone's confidante now."

"So you are, my dear, and I should have made you mine, only I
fancied it might pain you to learn that your Teddy loved someone
else."

"Now, Mother, did you really think I could be so silly and
selfish, after I'd refused his love, when it was freshest, if not
best?"

"I knew you were sincere then, Jo, but lately I have thought
that if he came back, and asked again, you might perhaps, feel like
giving another answer. Forgive me, dear, I can't help seeing that
you are very lonely, and sometimes there is a hungry look in your
eyes that goes to my heart. So I fancied that your boy might fill
the empty place if he tried now."

"No, Mother, it is better as it is, and I'm glad Amy has learned
to love him. But you are right in one thing. I am lonely, and
perhaps if Teddy had tried again, I might have said 'Yes', not
because I love him any more, but because I care more to be loved
than when he went away."

"I'm glad of that, Jo, for it shows that you are getting on.
There are plenty to love you, so try to be satisfied with Father
and Mother, sisters and brothers, friends and babies, till the best
lover of all comes to give you your reward."

"Mothers are the best lovers in the world, but I don't mind
whispering to Marmee that I'd like to try all kinds. It's very
curious, but the more I try to satisfy myself with all sorts of
natural affections, the more I seem to want. I'd no idea hearts
could take in so many. Mine is so elastic, it never seems full now,
and I used to be quite contented with my family. I don't understand
it."

"I do," and Mrs. March smiled her wise smile, as Jo turned back
the leaves to read what Amy said of Laurie.
