Six weeks is a long time to wait, and a still longer time for a<br/>girl to keep a secret, but Jo did both, and was just beginning to<br/>give up all hope of ever seeing her manuscript again, when a letter<br/>arrived which almost took her breath away, for on opening it, a<br/>check for a hundred dollars fell into her lap. For a minute she<br/>stared at it as if it had been a snake, then she read her letter<br/>and began to cry. If the amiable gentleman who wrote that kindly<br/>note could have known what intense happiness he was giving a fellow<br/>creature, I think he would devote his leisure hours, if he has any,<br/>to that amusement, for Jo valued the letter more than the money,<br/>because it was encouraging, and after years of effort it was so<br/>pleasant to find that she had learned to do something, though it<br/>was only to write a sensation story.<br/><br/>A prouder young woman was seldom seen than she, when, having<br/>composed herself, she electrified the family by appearing before<br/>them with the letter in one hand, the check in the other,<br/>announcing that she had won the prize. Of course there was a great<br/>jubilee, and when the story came everyone read and praised it,<br/>though after her father had told her that the language was good,<br/>the romance fresh and hearty, and the tragedy quite thrilling, he<br/>shook his head, and said in his unworldly wayâ€¦<br/><br/>"You can do better than this, Jo. Aim at the highest, and never<br/>mind the money."<br/><br/>"I think the money is the best part of it. What will you do with<br/>such a fortune?" asked Amy, regarding the magic slip of paper with<br/>a reverential eye.<br/><br/>"Send Beth and Mother to the seaside for a month or two,"<br/>answered Jo promptly.<br/><br/>To the seaside they went, after much discussion, and though Beth<br/>didn't come home as plump and rosy as could be desired, she was<br/>much better, while Mrs. March declared she felt ten years younger.<br/>So Jo was satisfied with the investment of her prize money, and<br/>fell to work with a cheery spirit, bent on earning more of those<br/>delightful checks. She did earn several that year, and began to<br/>feel herself a power in the house, for by the magic of a pen, her<br/>'rubbish' turned into comforts for them all. The Duke's Daughter<br/>paid the butcher's bill, A Phantom Hand put down a new carpet, and<br/>the Curse of the Coventrys proved the blessing of the Marches in<br/>the way of groceries and gowns.<br/><br/>Wealth is certainly a most desirable thing, but poverty has its<br/>sunny side, and one of the sweet uses of adversity is the genuine<br/>satisfaction which comes from hearty work of head or hand, and to<br/>the inspiration of necessity, we owe half the wise, beautiful, and<br/>useful blessings of the world. Jo enjoyed a taste of this<br/>satisfaction, and ceased to envy richer girls, taking great comfort<br/>in the knowledge that she could supply her own wants, and need ask<br/>no one for a penny.<br/><br/>Little notice was taken of her stories, but they found a market,<br/>and encouraged by this fact, she resolved to make a bold stroke for<br/>fame and fortune. Having copied her novel for the fourth time, read<br/>it to all her confidential friends, and submitted it with fear and<br/>trembling to three publishers, she at last disposed of it, on<br/>condition that she would cut it down one third, and omit all the<br/>parts which she particularly admired.<br/><br/>"Now I must either bundle it back in to my tin kitchen to mold,<br/>pay for printing it myself, or chop it up to suit purchasers and<br/>get what I can for it. Fame is a very good thing to have in the<br/>house, but cash is more convenient, so I wish to take the sense of<br/>the meeting on this important subject," said Jo, calling a family<br/>council.<br/><br/>"Don't spoil your book, my girl, for there is more in it than<br/>you know, and the idea is well worked out. Let it wait and ripen,"<br/>was her father's advice, and he practiced what he preached, having<br/>waited patiently thirty years for fruit of his own to ripen, and<br/>being in no haste to gather it even now when it was sweet and<br/>mellow.<br/><br/>"It seems to me that Jo will profit more by taking the trial<br/>than by waiting," said Mrs. March. "Criticism is the best test of<br/>such work, for it will show her both unsuspected merits and faults,<br/>and help her to do better next time. We are too partial, but the<br/>praise and blame of outsiders will prove useful, even if she gets<br/>but little money."<br/>
