"Where's Laurie?" she asked presently, when she had collected<br/>her thoughts and decided on the first duties to be done.<br/><br/>"Here, ma'am. Oh, let me do something!" cried the boy, hurrying<br/>from the next room whither he had withdrawn, feeling that their<br/>first sorrow was too sacred for even his friendly eyes to see.<br/><br/>"Send a telegram saying I will come at once. The next train goes<br/>early in the morning. I'll take that."<br/><br/>"What else? The horses are ready. I can go anywhere, do<br/>anything," he said, looking ready to fly to the ends of the<br/>earth.<br/><br/>"Leave a note at Aunt March's. Jo, give me that pen and<br/>paper."<br/><br/>Tearing off the blank side of one of her newly copied pages, Jo<br/>drew the table before her mother, well knowing that money for the<br/>long, sad journey must be borrowed, and feeling as if she could do<br/>anything to add a little to the sum for her father.<br/><br/>"Now go, dear, but don't kill yourself driving at a desperate<br/>pace. There is no need of that."<br/><br/>Mrs. March's warning was evidently thrown away, for five minutes<br/>later Laurie tore by the window on his own fleet horse, riding as<br/>if for his life.<br/><br/>"Jo, run to the rooms, and tell Mrs. King that I can't come. On<br/>the way get these things. I'll put them down, they'll be needed and<br/>I must go prepared for nursing. Hospital stores are not always<br/>good. Beth, go and ask Mr. Laurence for a couple of bottles of old<br/>wine. I'm not too proud to beg for Father. He shall have the best<br/>of everything. Amy, tell Hannah to get down the black trunk, and<br/>Meg, come and help me find my things, for I'm half bewildered."<br/><br/>Writing, thinking, and directing all at once might well bewilder<br/>the poor lady, and Meg begged her to sit quietly in her room for a<br/>little while, and let them work. Everyone scattered like leaves<br/>before a gust of wind, and the quiet, happy household was broken up<br/>as suddenly as if the paper had been an evil spell.<br/><br/>Mr. Laurence came hurrying back with Beth, bringing every<br/>comfort the kind old gentleman could think of for the invalid, and<br/>friendliest promises of protection for the girls during the<br/>mother's absence, which comforted her very much. There was nothing<br/>he didn't offer, from his own dressing gown to himself as escort.<br/>But the last was impossible. Mrs. March would not hear of the old<br/>gentleman's undertaking the long journey, yet an expression of<br/>relief was visible when he spoke of it, for anxiety ill fits one<br/>for traveling. He saw the look, knit his heavy eyebrows, rubbed his<br/>hands, and marched abruptly away, saying he'd be back directly. No<br/>one had time to think of him again till, as Meg ran through the<br/>entry, with a pair of rubbers in one hand and a cup of tea in the<br/>other, she came suddenly upon Mr. Brooke.<br/>
