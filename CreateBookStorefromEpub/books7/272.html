"It isn't made or trimmed," sighed Meg, faintly, for a sudden<br/>recollection of the cost still to be incurred quite overwhelmed<br/>her.<br/><br/>"Twenty-five yards of silk seems a good deal to cover one small<br/>woman, but I've no doubt my wife will look as fine as Ned Moffat's<br/>when she gets it on," said John dryly.<br/><br/>"I know you are angry, John, but I can't help it. I don't mean<br/>to waste your money, and I didn't think those little things would<br/>count up so. I can't resist them when I see Sallie buying all she<br/>wants, and pitying me because I don't. I try to be contented, but<br/>it is hard, and I'm tired of being poor."<br/><br/>The last words were spoken so low she thought he did not hear<br/>them, but he did, and they wounded him deeply, for he had denied<br/>himself many pleasures for Meg's sake. She could have bitten her<br/>tongue out the minute she had said it, for John pushed the books<br/>away and got up, saying with a little quiver in his voice, "I was<br/>afraid of this. I do my best, Meg." If he had scolded her, or even<br/>shaken her, it would not have broken her heart like those few<br/>words. She ran to him and held him close, crying, with repentant<br/>tears, "Oh, John, my dear, kind, hard-working boy. I didn't mean<br/>it! It was so wicked, so untrue and ungrateful, how could I say it!<br/>Oh, how could I say it!"<br/><br/>He was very kind, forgave her readily, and did not utter one<br/>reproach, but Meg knew that she had done and said a thing which<br/>would not be forgotten soon, although he might never allude to it<br/>again. She had promised to love him for better or worse, and then<br/>she, his wife, had reproached him with his poverty, after spending<br/>his earnings recklessly. It was dreadful, and the worst of it was<br/>John went on so quietly afterward, just as if nothing had happened,<br/>except that he stayed in town later, and worked at night when she<br/>had gone to cry herself to sleep. A week of remorse nearly made Meg<br/>sick, and the discovery that John had countermanded the order for<br/>his new greatcoat reduced her to a state of despair which was<br/>pathetic to behold. He had simply said, in answer to her surprised<br/>inquiries as to the change, "I can't afford it, my dear."<br/><br/>Meg said no more, but a few minutes after he found her in the<br/>hall with her face buried in the old greatcoat, crying as if her<br/>heart would break.<br/><br/>They had a long talk that night, and Meg learned to love her<br/>husband better for his poverty, because it seemed to have made a<br/>man of him, given him the strength and courage to fight his own<br/>way, and taught him a tender patience with which to bear and<br/>comfort the natural longings and failures of those he loved.<br/><br/>Next day she put her pride in her pocket, went to Sallie, told<br/>the truth, and asked her to buy the silk as a favor. The<br/>good-natured Mrs. Moffat willingly did so, and had the delicacy not<br/>to make her a present of it immediately afterward. Then Meg ordered<br/>home the greatcoat, and when John arrived, she put it on, and asked<br/>him how he liked her new silk gown. One can imagine what answer he<br/>made, how he received his present, and what a blissful state of<br/>things ensued. John came home early, Meg gadded no more, and that<br/>greatcoat was put on in the morning by a very happy husband, and<br/>taken off at night by a most devoted little wife. So the year<br/>rolled round, and at midsummer there came to Meg a new experience,<br/>the deepest and tenderest of a woman's life.<br/><br/>Laurie came sneaking into the kitchen of the Dovecote one<br/>Saturday, with an excited face, and was received with the clash of<br/>cymbals, for Hannah clapped her hands with a saucepan in one and<br/>the cover in the other.<br/><br/>"How's the little mamma? Where is everybody? Why didn't you tell<br/>me before I came home?" began Laurie in a loud whisper.<br/><br/>"Happy as a queen, the dear! Every soul of 'em is upstairs a<br/>worshipin'. We didn't want no hurrycanes round. Now you go into the<br/>parlor, and I'll send 'em down to you," with which somewhat<br/>involved reply Hannah vanished, chuckling ecstatically.<br/>
