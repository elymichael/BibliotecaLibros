Mrs. March held out her hand to Jo, who took it, smiling, with<br/>tears in her eyes, and went on in the old enthusiastic way, which<br/>they had not seen for a long while.<br/><br/>"I told my plan to Fritz once, and he said it was just what he<br/>would like, and agreed to try it when we got rich. Bless his dear<br/>heart, he's been doing it all his life—helping poor boys, I mean,<br/>not getting rich, that he'll never be. Money doesn't stay in his<br/>pocket long enough to lay up any. But now, thanks to my good old<br/>aunt, who loved me better than I ever deserved, I'm rich, at least<br/>I feel so, and we can live at Plumfield perfectly well, if we have<br/>a flourishing school. It's just the place for boys, the house is<br/>big, and the furniture strong and plain. There's plenty of room for<br/>dozens inside, and splendid grounds outside. They could help in the<br/>garden and orchard. Such work is healthy, isn't it, sir? Then Fritz<br/>could train and teach in his own way, and Father will help him. I<br/>can feed and nurse and pet and scold them, and Mother will be my<br/>stand-by. I've always longed for lots of boys, and never had<br/>enough, now I can fill the house full and revel in the little dears<br/>to my heart's content. Think what luxury— Plumfield my own, and a<br/>wilderness of boys to enjoy it with me."<br/><br/>As Jo waved her hands and gave a sigh of rapture, the family<br/>went off into a gale of merriment, and Mr. Laurence laughed till<br/>they thought he'd have an apoplectic fit.<br/><br/>"I don't see anything funny," she said gravely, when she could<br/>be heard. "Nothing could be more natural and proper than for my<br/>Professor to open a school, and for me to prefer to reside in my<br/>own estate."<br/><br/>"She is putting on airs already," said Laurie, who regarded the<br/>idea in the light of a capital joke. "But may I inquire how you<br/>intend to support the establishment? If all the pupils are little<br/>ragamuffins, I'm afraid your crop won't be profitable in a worldly<br/>sense, Mrs. Bhaer."<br/><br/>"Now don't be a wet-blanket, Teddy. Of course I shall have rich<br/>pupils, also—perhaps begin with such altogether. Then, when I've<br/>got a start, I can take in a ragamuffin or two, just for a relish.<br/>Rich people's children often need care and comfort, as well as<br/>poor. I've seen unfortunate little creatures left to servants, or<br/>backward ones pushed forward, when it's real cruelty. Some are<br/>naughty through mismanagment or neglect, and some lose their<br/>mothers. Besides, the best have to get through the hobbledehoy age,<br/>and that's the very time they need most patience and kindness.<br/>People laugh at them, and hustle them about, try to keep them out<br/>of sight, and expect them to turn all at once from pretty children<br/>into fine young men. They don't complain much—plucky little<br/>souls—but they feel it. I've been through something of it, and I<br/>know all about it. I've a special interest in such young bears, and<br/>like to show them that I see the warm, honest, well-meaning boys'<br/>hearts, in spite of the clumsy arms and legs and the topsy-turvy<br/>heads. I've had experience, too, for haven't I brought up one boy<br/>to be a pride and honor to his family?"<br/><br/>"I'll testify that you tried to do it," said Laurie with a<br/>grateful look.<br/><br/>"And I've succeeded beyond my hopes, for here you are, a steady,<br/>sensible businessman, doing heaps of good with your money, and<br/>laying up the blessings of the poor, instead of dollars. But you<br/>are not merely a businessman, you love good and beautiful things,<br/>enjoy them yourself, and let others go halves, as you always did in<br/>the old times. I am proud of you, Teddy, for you get better every<br/>year, and everyone feels it, though you won't let them say so. Yes,<br/>and when I have my flock, I'll just point to you, and say 'There's<br/>your model, my lads'."<br/><br/>Poor Laurie didn't know where to look, for, man though he was,<br/>something of the old bashfulness came over him as this burst of<br/>praise made all faces turn approvingly upon him.<br/><br/>"I say, Jo, that's rather too much," he began, just in his old<br/>boyish way. "You have all done more for me than I can ever thank<br/>you for, except by doing my best not to disappoint you. You have<br/>rather cast me off lately, Jo, but I've had the best of help,<br/>nevertheless. So, if I've got on at all, you may thank these two<br/>for it," and he laid one hand gently on his grandfather's head, and<br/>the other on Amy's golden one, for the three were never far<br/>apart.<br/><br/>"I do think that families are the most beautiful things in all<br/>the world!" burst out Jo, who was in an unusually up-lifted frame<br/>of mind just then. "When I have one of my own, I hope it will be as<br/>happy as the three I know and love the best. If John and my Fritz<br/>were only here, it would be quite a little heaven on earth," she<br/>added more quietly. And that night when she went to her room after<br/>a blissful evening of family counsels, hopes, and plans, her heart<br/>was so full of happiness that she could only calm it by kneeling<br/>beside the empty bed always near her own, and thinking tender<br/>thoughts of Beth.<br/>
