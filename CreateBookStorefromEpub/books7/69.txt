"So it is!" cried Laurie, who was playing chess in a corner with
Jo. "I knew a girl once, who had a really remarkable talent for
music, and she didn't know it, never guessed what sweet little
things she composed when she was alone, and wouldn't have believed
it if anyone had told her."

"I wish I'd known that nice girl. Maybe she would have helped
me, I'm so stupid," said Beth, who stood beside him, listening
eagerly.

"You do know her, and she helps you better than anyone else
could," answered Laurie, looking at her with such mischievous
meaning in his merry black eyes that Beth suddenly turned very red,
and hid her face in the sofa cushion, quite overcome by such an
unexpected discovery.

Jo let Laurie win the game to pay for that praise of her Beth,
who could not be prevailed upon to play for them after her
compliment. So Laurie did his best, and sang delightfully, being in
a particularly lively humor, for to the Marches he seldom showed
the moody side of his character. When he was gone, Amy, who had
been pensive all evening, said suddenly, as if busy over some new
idea, "Is Laurie an accomplished boy?"

"Yes, he has had an excellent education, and has much talent. He
will make a fine man, if not spoiled by petting," replied her
mother.

"And he isn't conceited, is he?" asked Amy.

"Not in the least. That is why he is so charming and we all like
him so much."

"I see. It's nice to have accomplishments and be elegant, but
not to show off or get perked up," said Amy thoughtfully.

"These things are always seen and felt in a person's manner and
conversations, if modestly used, but it is not necessary to display
them," said Mrs. March.

"Any more than it's proper to wear all your bonnets and gowns
and ribbons at once, that folks may know you've got them," added
Jo, and the lecture ended in a laugh.
