"Well, I won't for the present, anyway, but I'm disgusted, and
wish you hadn't told me."

"I thought you'd be pleased."

"At the idea of anybody coming to take Meg away? No, thank
you."

"You'll feel better about it when somebody comes to take you
away."

"I'd like to see anyone try it," cried Jo fiercely.

"So should I!" and Laurie chuckled at the idea.

"I don't think secrets agree with me, I feel rumpled up in my
mind since you told me that," said Jo rather ungratefully.

"Race down this hill with me, and you'll be all right,"
suggested Laurie.

No one was in sight, the smooth road sloped invitingly before
her, and finding the temptation irresistible, Jo darted away, soon
leaving hat and comb behind her and scattering hairpins as she ran.
Laurie reached the goal first and was quite satisfied with the
success of his treatment, for his Atlanta came panting up with
flying hair, bright eyes, ruddy cheeks, and no signs of
dissatisfaction in her face.

"I wish I was a horse, then I could run for miles in this
splendid air, and not lose my breath. It was capital, but see what
a guy it's made me. Go, pick up my things, like a cherub, as you
are," said Jo, dropping down under a maple tree, which was
carpeting the bank with crimson leaves.

Laurie leisurely departed to recover the lost property, and Jo
bundled up her braids, hoping no one would pass by till she was
tidy again. But someone did pass, and who should it be but Meg,
looking particularly ladylike in her state and festival suit, for
she had been making calls.
