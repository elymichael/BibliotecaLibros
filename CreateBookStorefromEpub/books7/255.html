<br/>"My lady," as her friends called her, sincerely desired to be a<br/>genuine lady, and was so at heart, but had yet to learn that money<br/>cannot buy refinement of nature, that rank does not always confer<br/>nobility, and that true breeding makes itself felt in spite of<br/>external drawbacks.<br/><br/>"I want to ask a favor of you, Mamma," Amy said, coming in with<br/>an important air one day.<br/><br/>"Well, little girl, what is it?" replied her mother, in whose<br/>eyes the stately young lady still remained 'the baby'.<br/><br/>"Our drawing class breaks up next week, and before the girls<br/>separate for the summer, I want to ask them out here for a day.<br/>They are wild to see the river, sketch the broken bridge, and copy<br/>some of the things they admire in my book. They have been very kind<br/>to me in many ways, and I am grateful, for they are all rich and I<br/>know I am poor, yet they never made any difference."<br/><br/>"Why should they?" and Mrs. March put the question with what the<br/>girls called her 'Maria Theresa air'.<br/><br/>"You know as well as I that it does make a difference with<br/>nearly everyone, so don't ruffle up like a dear, motherly hen, when<br/>your chickens get pecked by smarter birds. The ugly duckling turned<br/>out a swan, you know." and Amy smiled without bitterness, for she<br/>possessed a happy temper and hopeful spirit.<br/><br/>Mrs. March laughed, and smoothed down her maternal pride as she<br/>asked, "Well, my swan, what is your plan?"<br/><br/>"I should like to ask the girls out to lunch next week, to take<br/>them for a drive to the places they want to see, a row on the<br/>river, perhaps, and make a little artistic fete for them."<br/><br/>"That looks feasible. What do you want for lunch? Cake,<br/>sandwiches, fruit, and coffee will be all that is necessary, I<br/>suppose?"<br/><br/>"Oh, dear, no! We must have cold tongue and chicken, French<br/>chocolate and ice cream, besides. The girls are used to such<br/>things, and I want my lunch to be proper and elegant, though I do<br/>work for my living."<br/><br/>
