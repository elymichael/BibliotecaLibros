"Two letters for Doctor Jo, a book, and a funny old hat, which
covered the whole post office and stuck outside," said Beth,
laughing as she went into the study where Jo sat writing.

"What a sly fellow Laurie is! I said I wished bigger hats were
the fashion, because I burn my face every hot day. He said, 'Why
mind the fashion? Wear a big hat, and be comfortable!' I said I
would if I had one, and he has sent me this, to try me. I'll wear
it for fun, and show him I don't care for the fashion." And hanging
the antique broad-brim on a bust of Plato, Jo read her letters.

One from her mother made her cheeks glow and her eyes fill, for
it said to her…


My Dear:

I write a little word to tell you with how much
satisfaction I watch your efforts to control your temper. You say
nothing about your trials, failures, or successes, and think,
perhaps, that no one sees them but the Friend whose help you daily
ask, if I may trust the well-worn cover of your guidebook. I, too,
have seen them all, and heartily believe in the sincerity of your
resolution, since it begins to bear fruit. Go on, dear, patiently
and bravely, and always believe that no one sympathizes more
tenderly with you than your loving…

Mother


"That does me good! That's worth millions of money and pecks of
praise. Oh, Marmee, I do try! I will keep on trying, and not get
tired, since I have you to help me."

Laying her head on her arms, Jo wet her little romance with a
few happy tears, for she had thought that no one saw and
appreciated her efforts to be good, and this assurance was doubly
precious, doubly encouraging, because unexpected and from the
person whose commendation she most valued. Feeling stronger than
ever to meet and subdue her Apollyon, she pinned the note inside
her frock, as a shield and a reminder, lest she be taken unaware,
and proceeded to open her other letter, quite ready for either good
or bad news. In a big, dashing hand, Laurie wrote…


Dear Jo, What ho!
