A SAD ACCIDENT

&#160;

On Friday last, we were startled by a violent shock in our
basement, followed by cries of distress. On rushing in a body to
the cellar, we discovered our beloved President prostrate upon the
floor, having tripped and fallen while getting wood for domestic
purposes. A perfect scene of ruin met our eyes, for in his fall Mr.
Pickwick had plunged his head and shoulders into a tub of water,
upset a keg of soft soap upon his manly form, and torn his garments
badly. On being removed from this perilous situation, it was
discovered that he had suffered no injury but several bruises, and
we are happy to add, is now doing well.
