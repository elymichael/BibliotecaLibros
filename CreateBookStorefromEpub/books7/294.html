<br/>"Oh, my tongue, my abominable tongue! Why can't I learn to keep<br/>it quiet?" groaned Jo, remembering words which had been her<br/>undoing. When she had heard the explanation of the quoted phrases,<br/>Mrs. March said sorrowfullyâ€¦<br/><br/>"I wish you could have gone, but there is no hope of it this<br/>time, so try to bear it cheerfully, and don't sadden Amy's pleasure<br/>by reproaches or regrets."<br/><br/>"I'll try," said Jo, winking hard as she knelt down to pick up<br/>the basket she had joyfully upset. "I'll take a leaf out of her<br/>book, and try not only to seem glad, but to be so, and not grudge<br/>her one minute of happiness. But it won't be easy, for it is a<br/>dreadful disappointment," and poor Jo bedewed the little fat<br/>pincushion she held with several very bitter tears.<br/><br/>"Jo, dear, I'm very selfish, but I couldn't spare you, and I'm<br/>glad you are not going quite yet," whispered Beth, embracing her,<br/>basket and all, with such a clinging touch and loving face that Jo<br/>felt comforted in spite of the sharp regret that made her want to<br/>box her own ears, and humbly beg Aunt Carrol to burden her with<br/>this favor, and see how gratefully she would bear it.<br/><br/>By the time Amy came in, Jo was able to take her part in the<br/>family jubilation, not quite as heartily as usual, perhaps, but<br/>without repinings at Amy's good fortune. The young lady herself<br/>received the news as tidings of great joy, went about in a solemn<br/>sort of rapture, and began to sort her colors and pack her pencils<br/>that evening, leaving such trifles as clothes, money, and passports<br/>to those less absorbed in visions of art than herself.<br/><br/>"It isn't a mere pleasure trip to me, girls," she said<br/>impressively, as she scraped her best palette. "It will decide my<br/>career, for if I have any genius, I shall find it out in Rome, and<br/>will do something to prove it."<br/><br/>"Suppose you haven't?" said Jo, sewing away, with red eyes, at<br/>the new collars which were to be handed over to Amy.<br/><br/>"Then I shall come home and teach drawing for my living,"<br/>replied the aspirant for fame, with philosophic composure. But she<br/>made a wry face at the prospect, and scratched away at her palette<br/>as if bent on vigorous measures before she gave up her hopes.<br/><br/>"No, you won't. You hate hard work, and you'll marry some rich<br/>man, and come home to sit in the lap of luxury all your days," said<br/>Jo.<br/><br/>"Your predictions sometimes come to pass, but I don't believe<br/>that one will. I'm sure I wish it would, for if I can't be an<br/>artist myself, I should like to be able to help those who are,"<br/>said Amy, smiling, as if the part of Lady Bountiful would suit her<br/>better than that of a poor drawing teacher.<br/><br/>
