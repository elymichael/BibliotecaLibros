"That's the fun of it," began Laurie, who had got a willful fit
on him and was possessed to break out of bounds in some way.

"Hold your tongue!" cried Jo, covering her ears. "'Prunes and
prisms' are my doom, and I may as well make up my mind to it. I
came here to moralize, not to hear things that make me skip to
think of."

"I know Meg would wet-blanket such a proposal, but I thought you
had more spirit," began Laurie insinuatingly.

"Bad boy, be quiet! Sit down and think of your own sins, don't
go making me add to mine. If I get your grandpa to apologize for
the shaking, will you give up running away?" asked Jo
seriously.

"Yes, but you won't do it," answered Laurie, who wished to make
up, but felt that his outraged dignity must be appeased first.

"If I can manage the young one, I can the old one," muttered Jo,
as she walked away, leaving Laurie bent over a railroad map with
his head propped up on both hands.

"Come in!" and Mr. Laurence's gruff voice sounded gruffer than
ever, as Jo tapped at his door.

"It's only me, Sir, come to return a book," she said blandly, as
she entered.

"Want any more?" asked the old gentleman, looking grim and
vexed, but trying not to show it.

"Yes, please. I like old Sam so well, I think I'll try the
second volume," returned Jo, hoping to propitiate him by accepting
a second dose of Boswell's Johnson, as he had recommended that
lively work.

The shaggy eyebrows unbent a little as he rolled the steps
toward the shelf where the Johnsonian literature was placed. Jo
skipped up, and sitting on the top step, affected to be searching
for her book, but was really wondering how best to introduce the
dangerous object of her visit. Mr. Laurence seemed to suspect that
something was brewing in her mind, for after taking several brisk
turns about the room, he faced round on her, speaking so abruptly
that Rasselas tumbled face downward on the floor.
