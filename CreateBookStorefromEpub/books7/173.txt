Laurie and his grandfather came over to see her off, and Mr.
Brooke looked so strong and sensible and kind that the girls
christened him 'Mr. Greatheart' on the spot.

"Goodby, my darlings! God bless and keep us all!" whispered Mrs.
March, as she kissed one dear little face after the other, and
hurried into the carriage.

As she rolled away, the sun came out, and looking back, she saw
it shining on the group at the gate like a good omen. They saw it
also, and smiled and waved their hands, and the last thing she
beheld as she turned the corner was the four bright faces, and
behind them like a bodyguard, old Mr. Laurence, faithful Hannah,
and devoted Laurie.

"How kind everyone is to us!" she said, turning to find fresh
proof of it in the respectful sympathy of the young man's face.

"I don't see how they can help it," returned Mr. Brooke,
laughing so infectiously that Mrs. March could not help smiling.
And so the journey began with the good omens of sunshine, smiles,
and cheerful words.

"I feel as if there had been an earthquake," said Jo, as their
neighbors went home to breakfast, leaving them to rest and refresh
themselves.

"It seems as if half the house was gone," added Meg
forlornly.

Beth opened her lips to say something, but could only point to
the pile of nicely mended hose which lay on Mother's table, showing
that even in her last hurried moments she had thought and worked
for them. It was a little thing, but it went straight to their
hearts, and in spite of their brave resolutions, they all broke
down and cried bitterly.

Hannah wisely allowed them to relieve their feelings, and when
the shower showed signs of clearing up, she came to the rescue,
armed with a coffeepot.

"Now, my dear young ladies, remember what your ma said, and
don't fret. Come and have a cup of coffee all round, and then let's
fall to work and be a credit to the family."
