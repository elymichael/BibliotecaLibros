"How many young ladies are there?" asked her mother, beginning<br/>to look sober.<br/><br/>"Twelve or fourteen in the class, but I dare say they won't all<br/>come."<br/><br/>"Bless me, child, you will have to charter an omnibus to carry<br/>them about."<br/><br/>"Why, Mother, how can you think of such a thing? Not more than<br/>six or eight will probably come, so I shall hire a beach wagon and<br/>borrow Mr. Laurence's cherry-bounce." (Hannah's pronunciation of<br/>char-a-banc.)<br/><br/>"All of this will be expensive, Amy."<br/><br/>"Not very. I've calculated the cost, and I'll pay for it<br/>myself."<br/><br/>"Don't you think, dear, that as these girls are used to such<br/>things, and the best we can do will be nothing new, that some<br/>simpler plan would be pleasanter to them, as a change if nothing<br/>more, and much better for us than buying or borrowing what we don't<br/>need, and attempting a style not in keeping with our<br/>circumstances?"<br/><br/>"If I can't have it as I like, I don't care to have it at all. I<br/>know that I can carry it out perfectly well, if you and the girls<br/>will help a little, and I don't see why I can't if I'm willing to<br/>pay for it," said Amy, with the decision which opposition was apt<br/>to change into obstinacy.<br/><br/>Mrs. March knew that experience was an excellent teacher, and<br/>when it was possible she left her children to learn alone the<br/>lessons which she would gladly have made easier, if they had not<br/>objected to taking advice as much as they did salts and senna.<br/><br/>"Very well, Amy, if your heart is set upon it, and you see your<br/>way through without too great an outlay of money, time, and temper,<br/>I'll say no more. Talk it over with the girls, and whichever way<br/>you decide, I'll do my best to help you."<br/><br/>"Thanks, Mother, you are always so kind." and away went Amy to<br/>lay her plan before her sisters.<br/>
