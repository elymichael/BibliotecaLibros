<br/>To Jo I leave my breastpin, the one mended with<br/>sealing wax, also my bronze inkstand—she lost the cover—and my most<br/>precious plaster rabbit, because I am sorry I burned up her<br/>story.<br/><br/>To Beth (if she lives after me) I give my dolls<br/>and the little bureau, my fan, my linen collars and my new slippers<br/>if she can wear them being thin when she gets well. And I herewith<br/>also leave her my regret that I ever made fun of old Joanna.<br/><br/>To my friend and neighbor Theodore Laurence I<br/>bequeethe my paper mashay portfolio, my clay model of a horse<br/>though he did say it hadn't any neck. Also in return for his great<br/>kindness in the hour of affliction any one of my artistic works he<br/>likes, Noter Dame is the best.<br/><br/>To our venerable benefactor Mr. Laurence I leave<br/>my purple box with a looking glass in the cover which will be nice<br/>for his pens and remind him of the departed girl who thanks him for<br/>his favors to her family, especially Beth.<br/><br/>I wish my favorite playmate Kitty Bryant to have<br/>the blue silk apron and my gold-bead ring with a kiss.<br/><br/>To Hannah I give the bandbox she wanted and all<br/>the patchwork I leave hoping she 'will remember me, when it you<br/>see'.<br/><br/>And now having disposed of my most valuable<br/>property I hope all will be satisfied and not blame the dead. I<br/>forgive everyone, and trust we may all meet when the trump shall<br/>sound. Amen.<br/><br/>To this will and testiment I set my hand and seal<br/>on this 20th day of Nov. Anni Domino 1861.<br/><br/>Amy Curtis March<br/><br/>Witnesses:<br/><br/>
