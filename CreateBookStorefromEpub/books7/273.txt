Presently Jo appeared, proudly bearing a flannel bundle laid
forth upon a large pillow. Jo's face was very sober, but her eyes
twinkled, and there was an odd sound in her voice of repressed
emotion of some sort.

"Shut your eyes and hold out your arms," she said
invitingly.

Laurie backed precipitately into a corner, and put his hands
behind him with an imploring gesture. "No, thank you. I'd rather
not. I shall drop it or smash it, as sure as fate."

"Then you shan't see your nevvy," said Jo decidedly, turning as
if to go.

"I will, I will! Only you must be responsible for damages." and
obeying orders, Laurie heroically shut his eyes while something was
put into his arms. A peal of laughter from Jo, Amy, Mrs. March,
Hannah, and John caused him to open them the next minute, to find
himself invested with two babies instead of one.

No wonder they laughed, for the expression of his face was droll
enough to convulse a Quaker, as he stood and stared wildly from the
unconscious innocents to the hilarious spectators with such dismay
that Jo sat down on the floor and screamed.

"Twins, by Jupiter!" was all he said for a minute, then turning
to the women with an appealing look that was comically piteous, he
added, "Take 'em quick, somebody! I'm going to laugh, and I shall
drop 'em."

Jo rescued his babies, and marched up and down, with one on each
arm, as if already initiated into the mysteries of babytending,
while Laurie laughed till the tears ran down his cheeks.

"It's the best joke of the season, isn't it? I wouldn't have
told you, for I set my heart on surprising you, and I flatter
myself I've done it," said Jo, when she got her breath.

"I never was more staggered in my life. Isn't it fun? Are they
boys? What are you going to name them? Let's have another look.
Hold me up, Jo, for upon my life it's one too many for me,"
returned Laurie, regarding the infants with the air of a big,
benevolent Newfoundland looking at a pair of infantile kittens.
