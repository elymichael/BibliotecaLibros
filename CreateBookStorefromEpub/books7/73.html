They had a charming time, for&#160;<br/>The Seven Castles Of The<br/>Diamond Lake<br/>&#160;was as brilliant and wonderful as heart<br/>could wish. But in spite of the comical red imps, sparkling elves,<br/>and the gorgeous princes and princesses, Jo's pleasure had a drop<br/>of bitterness in it. The fairy queen's yellow curls reminded her of<br/>Amy, and between the acts she amused herself with wondering what<br/>her sister would do to make her 'sorry for it'. She and Amy had had<br/>many lively skirmishes in the course of their lives, for both had<br/>quick tempers and were apt to be violent when fairly roused. Amy<br/>teased Jo, and Jo irritated Amy, and semioccasional explosions<br/>occurred, of which both were much ashamed afterward. Although the<br/>oldest, Jo had the least self-control, and had hard times trying to<br/>curb the fiery spirit which was continually getting her into<br/>trouble. Her anger never lasted long, and having humbly confessed<br/>her fault, she sincerely repented and tried to do better. Her<br/>sisters used to say that they rather liked to get Jo into a fury<br/>because she was such an angel afterward. Poor Jo tried desperately<br/>to be good, but her bosom enemy was always ready to flame up and<br/>defeat her, and it took years of patient effort to subdue it.<br/><br/>When they got home, they found Amy reading in the parlor. She<br/>assumed an injured air as they came in, never lifted her eyes from<br/>her book, or asked a single question. Perhaps curiosity might have<br/>conquered resentment, if Beth had not been there to inquire and<br/>receive a glowing description of the play. On going up to put away<br/>her best hat, Jo's first look was toward the bureau, for in their<br/>last quarrel Amy had soothed her feelings by turning Jo's top<br/>drawer upside down on the floor. Everything was in its place,<br/>however, and after a hasty glance into her various closets, bags,<br/>and boxes, Jo decided that Amy had forgiven and forgotten her<br/>wrongs.<br/><br/>There Jo was mistaken, for next day she made a discovery which<br/>produced a tempest. Meg, Beth, and Amy were sitting together, late<br/>in the afternoon, when Jo burst into the room, looking excited and<br/>demanding breathlessly, "Has anyone taken my book?"<br/><br/>Meg and Beth said, "No." at once, and looked surprised. Amy<br/>poked the fire and said nothing. Jo saw her color rise and was down<br/>upon her in a minute.<br/><br/>"Amy, you've got it!"<br/><br/>"No, I haven't."<br/><br/>"You know where it is, then!"<br/><br/>"No, I don't."<br/><br/>"That's a fib!" cried Jo, taking her by the shoulders, and<br/>looking fierce enough to frighten a much braver child than Amy.<br/><br/>"It isn't. I haven't got it, don't know where it is now, and<br/>don't care."<br/>
