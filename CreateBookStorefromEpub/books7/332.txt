She always used to take his arm on these occasions, now she did
not, and he made no complaint, which was a bad sign, but talked on
rapidly about all sorts of faraway subjects, till they turned from
the road into the little path that led homeward through the grove.
Then he walked more slowly, suddenly lost his fine flow of
language, and now and then a dreadful pause occurred. To rescue the
conversation from one of the wells of silence into which it kept
falling, Jo said hastily, "Now you must have a good long
holiday!"

"I intend to."

Something in his resolute tone made Jo look up quickly to find
him looking down at her with an expression that assured her the
dreaded moment had come, and made her put out her hand with an
imploring, "No, Teddy. Please don't!"

"I will, and you must hear me. It's no use, Jo, we've got to
have it out, and the sooner the better for both of us," he
answered, getting flushed and excited all at once.

"Say what you like then. I'll listen," said Jo, with a desperate
sort of patience.

Laurie was a young lover, but he was in earnest, and meant to
'have it out', if he died in the attempt, so he plunged into the
subject with characteristic impetuousity, saying in a voice that
would get choky now and then, in spite of manful efforts to keep it
steady…

"I've loved you ever since I've known you, Jo, couldn't help it,
you've been so good to me. I've tried to show it, but you wouldn't
let me. Now I'm going to make you hear, and give me an answer, for
I can't go on so any longer."

"I wanted to save you this. I thought you'd understand… " began
Jo, finding it a great deal harder than she expected.

"I know you did, but the girls are so queer you never know what
they mean. They say no when they mean yes, and drive a man out of
his wits just for the fun of it," returned Laurie, entrenching
himself behind an undeniable fact.

"I don't. I never wanted to make you care for me so, and I went
away to keep you from it if I could."
