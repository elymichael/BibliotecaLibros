<br/>That seemed a hard question to answer, and Laurie began to wish<br/>he had to work for his daily bread. Now if ever, occurred an<br/>eligible opportunity for 'going to the devil', as he once forcibly<br/>expressed it, for he had plenty of money and nothing to do, and<br/>Satan is proverbially fond of providing employment for full and<br/>idle hands. The poor fellow had temptations enough from without and<br/>from within, but he withstood them pretty well, for much as he<br/>valued liberty, he valued good faith and confidence more, so his<br/>promise to his grandfather, and his desire to be able to look<br/>honestly into the eyes of the women who loved him, and say "All's<br/>well," kept him safe and steady.<br/><br/>Very likely some Mrs. Grundy will observe, "I don't believe it,<br/>boys will be boys, young men must sow their wild oats, and women<br/>must not expect miracles." I dare say you don't, Mrs. Grundy, but<br/>it's true nevertheless. Women work a good many miracles, and I have<br/>a persuasion that they may perform even that of raising the<br/>standard of manhood by refusing to echo such sayings. Let the boys<br/>be boys, the longer the better, and let the young men sow their<br/>wild oats if they must. But mothers, sisters, and friends may help<br/>to make the crop a small one, and keep many tares from spoiling the<br/>harvest, by believing, and showing that they believe, in the<br/>possibility of loyalty to the virtues which make men manliest in<br/>good women's eyes. If it is a feminine delusion, leave us to enjoy<br/>it while we may, for without it half the beauty and the romance of<br/>life is lost, and sorrowful forebodings would embitter all our<br/>hopes of the brave, tenderhearted little lads, who still love their<br/>mothers better than themselves and are not ashamed to own it.<br/><br/>Laurie thought that the task of forgetting his love for Jo would<br/>absorb all his powers for years, but to his great surprise he<br/>discovered it grew easier every day. He refused to believe it at<br/>first, got angry with himself, and couldn't understand it, but<br/>these hearts of ours are curious and contrary things, and time and<br/>nature work their will in spite of us. Laurie's heart wouldn't<br/>ache. The wound persisted in healing with a rapidity that<br/>astonished him, and instead of trying to forget, he found himself<br/>trying to remember. He had not foreseen this turn of affairs, and<br/>was not prepared for it. He was disgusted with himself, surprised<br/>at his own fickleness, and full of a queer mixture of<br/>disappointment and relief that he could recover from such a<br/>tremendous blow so soon. He carefully stirred up the embers of his<br/>lost love, but they refused to burst into a blaze. There was only a<br/>comfortable glow that warmed and did him good without putting him<br/>into a fever, and he was reluctantly obliged to confess that the<br/>boyish passion was slowly subsiding into a more tranquil sentiment,<br/>very tender, a little sad and resentful still, but that was sure to<br/>pass away in time, leaving a brotherly affection which would last<br/>unbroken to the end.<br/><br/>As the word 'brotherly' passed through his mind in one of his<br/>reveries, he smiled, and glanced up at the picture of Mozart that<br/>was before him…<br/><br/>"Well, he was a great man, and when he couldn't have one sister<br/>he took the other, and was happy."<br/><br/>Laurie did not utter the words, but he thought them, and the<br/>next instant kissed the little old ring, saying to himself, "No, I<br/>won't! I haven't forgotten, I never can. I'll try again, and if<br/>that fails, why then… "<br/><br/>Leaving his sentence unfinished, he seized pen and paper and<br/>wrote to Jo, telling her that he could not settle to anything while<br/>there was the least hope of her changing her mind. Couldn't she,<br/>wouldn't she—and let him come home and be happy? While waiting for<br/>an answer he did nothing, but he did it energetically, for he was<br/>in a fever of impatience. It came at last, and settled his mind<br/>effectually on one point, for Jo decidedly couldn't and wouldn't.<br/>She was wrapped up in Beth, and never wished to hear the word love<br/>again. Then she begged him to be happy with somebody else, but<br/>always keep a little corner of his heart for his loving sister Jo.<br/>In a postscript she desired him not to tell Amy that Beth was<br/>worse, she was coming home in the spring and there was no need of<br/>saddening the remainder of her stay. That would be time enough,<br/>please God, but Laurie must write to her often, and not let her<br/>feel lonely, homesick or anxious.<br/><br/>"So I will, at once. Poor little girl, it will be a sad going<br/>home for her, I'm afraid," and Laurie opened his desk, as if<br/>writing to Amy had been the proper conclusion of the sentence left<br/>unfinished some weeks before.<br/><br/>But he did not write the letter that day, for as he rummaged out<br/>his best paper, he came across something which changed his purpose.<br/>Tumbling about in one part of the desk among bills, passports, and<br/>business documents of various kinds were several of Jo's letters,<br/>and in another compartment were three notes from Amy, carefully<br/>tied up with one of her blue ribbons and sweetly suggestive of the<br/>little dead roses put away inside. With a half-repentant,<br/>half-amused expression, Laurie gathered up all Jo's letters,<br/>smoothed, folded, and put them neatly into a small drawer of the<br/>desk, stood a minute turning the ring thoughtfully on his finger,<br/>then slowly drew it off, laid it with the letters, locked the<br/>drawer, and went out to hear High Mass at Saint Stefan's, feeling<br/>as if there had been a funeral, and though not overwhelmed with<br/>affliction, this seemed a more proper way to spend the rest of the<br/>day than in writing letters to charming young ladies.<br/><br/>The letter went very soon, however, and was promptly answered,<br/>for Amy was homesick, and confessed it in the most delightfully<br/>confiding manner. The correspondence flourished famously, and<br/>letters flew to and fro with unfailing regularity all through the<br/>early spring. Laurie sold his busts, made allumettes of his opera,<br/>and went back to Paris, hoping somebody would arrive before long.<br/>He wanted desperately to go to Nice, but would not till he was<br/>asked, and Amy would not ask him, for just then she was having<br/>little experiences of her own, which made her rather wish to avoid<br/>the quizzical eyes of 'our boy'.<br/><br/>
