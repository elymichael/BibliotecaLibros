"That is your best friend, of whom you speak?" he said in an<br/>altered tone.<br/><br/>"Yes, my boy Teddy. I'm very proud of him and should like you to<br/>see him."<br/><br/>Jo looked up then, quite unconscious of anything but her own<br/>pleasure in the prospect of showing them to one another. Something<br/>in Mr. Bhaer's face suddenly recalled the fact that she might find<br/>Laurie more than a 'best friend', and simply because she<br/>particularly wished not to look as if anything was the matter, she<br/>involuntarily began to blush, and the more she tried not to, the<br/>redder she grew. If it had not been for Tina on her knee. She<br/>didn't know what would have become of her. Fortunately the child<br/>was moved to hug her, so she managed to hide her face an instant,<br/>hoping the Professor did not see it. But he did, and his own<br/>changed again from that momentary anxiety to its usual expression,<br/>as he said cordiallyâ€¦<br/><br/>"I fear I shall not make the time for that, but I wish the<br/>friend much success, and you all happiness. Gott bless you!" And<br/>with that, he shook hands warmly, shouldered Tina, and went<br/>away.<br/><br/>But after the boys were abed, he sat long before his fire with<br/>the tired look on his face and the 'heimweh', or homesickness,<br/>lying heavy at his heart. Once, when he remembered Jo as she sat<br/>with the little child in her lap and that new softness in her face,<br/>he leaned his head on his hands a minute, and then roamed about the<br/>room, as if in search of something that he could not find.<br/><br/>"It is not for me, I must not hope it now," he said to himself,<br/>with a sigh that was almost a groan. Then, as if reproaching<br/>himself for the longing that he could not repress, he went and<br/>kissed the two tousled heads upon the pillow, took down his<br/>seldom-used meerschaum, and opened his Plato.<br/><br/>He did his best and did it manfully, but I don't think he found<br/>that a pair of rampant boys, a pipe, or even the divine Plato, were<br/>very satisfactory substitutes for wife and child at home.<br/><br/>Early as it was, he was at the station next morning to see Jo<br/>off, and thanks to him, she began her solitary journey with the<br/>pleasant memory of a familiar face smiling its farewell, a bunch of<br/>violets to keep her company, and best of all, the happy thought,<br/>"Well, the winter's gone, and I've written no books, earned no<br/>fortune, but I've made a friend worth having and I'll try to keep<br/>him all my life."<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
