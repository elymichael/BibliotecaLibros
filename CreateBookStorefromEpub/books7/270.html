"I've no objection," was Meg's equally soothing remark. A few<br/>other topics of general interest were introduced by Mr. Brooke and<br/>wet-blanketed by Mrs. Brooke, and conversation languished. John<br/>went to one window, unfolded his paper, and wrapped himself in it,<br/>figuratively speaking. Meg went to the other window, and sewed as<br/>if new rosettes for slippers were among the necessaries of life.<br/>Neither spoke. Both looked quite 'calm and firm', and both felt<br/>desperately uncomfortable.<br/><br/>"Oh, dear," thought Meg, "married life is very trying, and does<br/>need infinite patience as well as love, as Mother says." The word<br/>'Mother' suggested other maternal counsels given long ago, and<br/>received with unbelieving protests.<br/><br/>"John is a good man, but he has his faults, and you must learn<br/>to see and bear with them, remembering your own. He is very<br/>decided, but never will be obstinate, if you reason kindly, not<br/>oppose impatiently. He is very accurate, and particular about the<br/>truth—a good trait, though you call him 'fussy'. Never deceive him<br/>by look or word, Meg, and he will give you the confidence you<br/>deserve, the support you need. He has a temper, not like ours—one<br/>flash and then all over—but the white, still anger that is seldom<br/>stirred, but once kindled is hard to quench. Be careful, be very<br/>careful, not to wake his anger against yourself, for peace and<br/>happiness depend on keeping his respect. Watch yourself, be the<br/>first to ask pardon if you both err, and guard against the little<br/>piques, misunderstandings, and hasty words that often pave the way<br/>for bitter sorrow and regret."<br/><br/>These words came back to Meg, as she sat sewing in the sunset,<br/>especially the last. This was the first serious disagreement, her<br/>own hasty speeches sounded both silly and unkind, as she recalled<br/>them, her own anger looked childish now, and thoughts of poor John<br/>coming home to such a scene quite melted her heart. She glanced at<br/>him with tears in her eyes, but he did not see them. She put down<br/>her work and got up, thinking, "I will be the first to say,<br/>'Forgive me'", but he did not seem to hear her. She went very<br/>slowly across the room, for pride was hard to swallow, and stood by<br/>him, but he did not turn his head. For a minute she felt as if she<br/>really couldn't do it, then came the thought, "This is the<br/>beginning. I'll do my part, and have nothing to reproach myself<br/>with," and stooping down, she softly kissed her husband on the<br/>forehead. Of course that settled it. The penitent kiss was better<br/>than a world of words, and John had her on his knee in a minute,<br/>saying tenderly…<br/><br/>"It was too bad to laugh at the poor little jelly pots. Forgive<br/>me, dear. I never will again!"<br/><br/>But he did, oh bless you, yes, hundreds of times, and so did<br/>Meg, both declaring that it was the sweetest jelly they ever made,<br/>for family peace was preserved in that little family jar.<br/><br/>After this, Meg had Mr. Scott to dinner by special invitation,<br/>and served him up a pleasant feast without a cooked wife for the<br/>first course, on which occasion she was so gay and gracious, and<br/>made everything go off so charmingly, that Mr. Scott told John he<br/>was a lucky fellow, and shook his head over the hardships of<br/>bachelorhood all the way home.<br/><br/>In the autumn, new trials and experiences came to Meg. Sallie<br/>Moffat renewed her friendship, was always running out for a dish of<br/>gossip at the little house, or inviting 'that poor dear' to come in<br/>and spend the day at the big house. It was pleasant, for in dull<br/>weather Meg often felt lonely. All were busy at home, John absent<br/>till night, and nothing to do but sew, or read, or potter about. So<br/>it naturally fell out that Meg got into the way of gadding and<br/>gossiping with her friend. Seeing Sallie's pretty things made her<br/>long for such, and pity herself because she had not got them.<br/>Sallie was very kind, and often offered her the coveted trifles,<br/>but Meg declined them, knowing that John wouldn't like it, and then<br/>this foolish little woman went and did what John disliked even<br/>worse.<br/><br/>She knew her husband's income, and she loved to feel that he<br/>trusted her, not only with his happiness, but what some men seem to<br/>value more—his money. She knew where it was, was free to take what<br/>she liked, and all he asked was that she should keep account of<br/>every penny, pay bills once a month, and remember that she was a<br/>poor man's wife. Till now she had done well, been prudent and<br/>exact, kept her little account books neatly, and showed them to him<br/>monthly without fear. But that autumn the serpent got into Meg's<br/>paradise, and tempted her like many a modern Eve, not with apples,<br/>but with dress. Meg didn't like to be pitied and made to feel poor.<br/>It irritated her, but she was ashamed to confess it, and now and<br/>then she tried to console herself by buying something pretty, so<br/>that Sallie needn't think she had to economize. She always felt<br/>wicked after it, for the pretty things were seldom necessaries, but<br/>then they cost so little, it wasn't worth worrying about, so the<br/>trifles increased unconsciously, and in the shopping excursions she<br/>was no longer a passive looker-on.<br/><br/>But the trifles cost more than one would imagine, and when she<br/>cast up her accounts at the end of the month the sum total rather<br/>scared her. John was busy that month and left the bills to her, the<br/>next month he was absent, but the third he had a grand quarterly<br/>settling up, and Meg never forgot it. A few days before she had<br/>done a dreadful thing, and it weighed upon her conscience. Sallie<br/>had been buying silks, and Meg longed for a new one, just a<br/>handsome light one for parties, her black silk was so common, and<br/>thin things for evening wear were only proper for girls. Aunt March<br/>usually gave the sisters a present of twenty-five dollars apiece at<br/>New Year's. That was only a month to wait, and here was a lovely<br/>violet silk going at a bargain, and she had the money, if she only<br/>dared to take it. John always said what was his was hers, but would<br/>he think it right to spend not only the prospective<br/>five-and-twenty, but another five-and-twenty out of the household<br/>fund? That was the question. Sallie had urged her to do it, had<br/>offered to lend the money, and with the best intentions in life had<br/>tempted Meg beyond her strength. In an evil moment the shopman held<br/>up the lovely, shimmering folds, and said, "A bargain, I assure,<br/>you, ma'am." She answered, "I'll take it," and it was cut off and<br/>paid for, and Sallie had exulted, and she had laughed as if it were<br/>a thing of no consequence, and driven away, feeling as if she had<br/>stolen something, and the police were after her.<br/><br/>When she got home, she tried to assuage the pangs of remorse by<br/>spreading forth the lovely silk, but it looked less silvery now,<br/>didn't become her, after all, and the words 'fifty dollars' seemed<br/>stamped like a pattern down each breadth. She put it away, but it<br/>haunted her, not delightfully as a new dress should, but dreadfully<br/>like the ghost of a folly that was not easily laid. When John got<br/>out his books that night, Meg's heart sank, and for the first time<br/>in her married life, she was afraid of her husband. The kind, brown<br/>eyes looked as if they could be stern, and though he was unusually<br/>merry, she fancied he had found her out, but didn't mean to let her<br/>know it. The house bills were all paid, the books all in order.<br/>John had praised her, and was undoing the old pocketbook which they<br/>called the 'bank', when Meg, knowing that it was quite empty,<br/>stopped his hand, saying nervously…<br/>
