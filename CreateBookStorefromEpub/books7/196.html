<br/>"I, too, covet that, but not as a necklace. Ah, no! To me it is<br/>a rosary, and as such I should use it like a good catholic," said<br/>Esther, eyeing the handsome thing wistfully.<br/><br/>"Is it meant to use as you use the string of good-smelling<br/>wooden beads hanging over your glass?" asked Amy.<br/><br/>"Truly, yes, to pray with. It would be pleasing to the saints if<br/>one used so fine a rosary as this, instead of wearing it as a vain<br/>bijou."<br/><br/>"You seem to take a great deal of comfort in your prayers,<br/>Esther, and always come down looking quiet and satisfied. I wish I<br/>could."<br/><br/>"If Mademoiselle was a Catholic, she would find true comfort,<br/>but as that is not to be, it would be well if you went apart each<br/>day to meditate and pray, as did the good mistress whom I served<br/>before Madame. She had a little chapel, and in it found solacement<br/>for much trouble."<br/><br/>"Would it be right for me to do so too?" asked Amy, who in her<br/>loneliness felt the need of help of some sort, and found that she<br/>was apt to forget her little book, now that Beth was not there to<br/>remind her of it.<br/><br/>"It would be excellent and charming, and I shall gladly arrange<br/>the little dressing room for you if you like it. Say nothing to<br/>Madame, but when she sleeps go you and sit alone a while to think<br/>good thoughts, and pray the dear God preserve your sister."<br/><br/>Esther was truly pious, and quite sincere in her advice, for she<br/>had an affectionate heart, and felt much for the sisters in their<br/>anxiety. Amy liked the idea, and gave her leave to arrange the<br/>light closet next her room, hoping it would do her good.<br/><br/>"I wish I knew where all these pretty things would go when Aunt<br/>March dies," she said, as she slowly replaced the shining rosary<br/>and shut the jewel cases one by one.<br/><br/>"To you and your sisters. I know it, Madame confides in me. I<br/>witnessed her will, and it is to be so," whispered Esther<br/>smiling.<br/><br/>
