"How do you know I do, Miss?"<br/><br/>"I can always tell by his face when he goes away. If you have<br/>been good, he looks satisfied and walks briskly. If you have<br/>plagued him, he's sober and walks slowly, as if he wanted to go<br/>back and do his work better."<br/><br/>"Well, I like that? So you keep an account of my good and bad<br/>marks in Brooke's face, do you? I see him bow and smile as he<br/>passes your window, but I didn't know you'd got up a<br/>telegraph."<br/><br/>"We haven't. Don't be angry, and oh, don't tell him I said<br/>anything! It was only to show that I cared how you get on, and what<br/>is said here is said in confidence, you know," cried Meg, much<br/>alarmed at the thought of what might follow from her careless<br/>speech.<br/><br/>"I don't tell tales," replied Laurie, with his 'high and mighty'<br/>air, as Jo called a certain expression which he occasionally wore.<br/>"Only if Brooke is going to be a thermometer, I must mind and have<br/>fair weather for him to report."<br/><br/>"Please don't be offended. I didn't mean to preach or tell tales<br/>or be silly. I only thought Jo was encouraging you in a feeling<br/>which you'd be sorry for by-and-by. You are so kind to us, we feel<br/>as if you were our brother and say just what we think. Forgive me,<br/>I meant it kindly." And Meg offered her hand with a gesture both<br/>affectionate and timid.<br/><br/>Ashamed of his momentary pique, Laurie squeezed the kind little<br/>hand, and said frankly, "I'm the one to be forgiven. I'm cross and<br/>have been out of sorts all day. I like to have you tell me my<br/>faults and be sisterly, so don't mind if I am grumpy sometimes. I<br/>thank you all the same."<br/><br/>Bent on showing that he was not offended, he made himself as<br/>agreeable as possible, wound cotton for Meg, recited poetry to<br/>please Jo, shook down cones for Beth, and helped Amy with her<br/>ferns, proving himself a fit person to belong to the 'Busy Bee<br/>Society'. In the midst of an animated discussion on the domestic<br/>habits of turtles (one of those amiable creatures having strolled<br/>up from the river), the faint sound of a bell warned them that<br/>Hannah had put the tea 'to draw', and they would just have time to<br/>get home to supper.<br/><br/>"May I come again?" asked Laurie.<br/><br/>"Yes, if you are good, and love your book, as the boys in the<br/>primer are told to do," said Meg, smiling.<br/><br/>"I'll try."<br/>
