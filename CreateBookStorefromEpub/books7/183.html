<br/>"Don't be frightened, I guess I shan't have it badly. I looked<br/>in Mother's book, and saw that it begins with headache, sore<br/>throat, and queer feelings like mine, so I did take some<br/>belladonna, and I feel better," said Beth, laying her cold hands on<br/>her hot forehead and trying to look well.<br/><br/>"If Mother was only at home!" exclaimed Jo, seizing the book,<br/>and feeling that Washington was an immense way off. She read a<br/>page, looked at Beth, felt her head, peeped into her throat, and<br/>then said gravely, "You've been over the baby every day for more<br/>than a week, and among the others who are going to have it, so I'm<br/>afraid you are going to have it, Beth. I'll call Hannah, she knows<br/>all about sickness."<br/><br/>"Don't let Amy come. She never had it, and I should hate to give<br/>it to her. Can't you and Meg have it over again?" asked Beth,<br/>anxiously.<br/><br/>"I guess not. Don't care if I do. Serve me right, selfish pig,<br/>to let you go, and stay writing rubbish myself!" muttered Jo, as<br/>she went to consult Hannah.<br/><br/>The good soul was wide awake in a minute, and took the lead at<br/>once, assuring that there was no need to worry; every one had<br/>scarlet fever, and if rightly treated, nobody died, all of which Jo<br/>believed, and felt much relieved as they went up to call Meg.<br/><br/>"Now I'll tell you what we'll do," said Hannah, when she had<br/>examined and questioned Beth, "we will have Dr. Bangs, just to take<br/>a look at you, dear, and see that we start right. Then we'll send<br/>Amy off to Aunt March's for a spell, to keep her out of harm's way,<br/>and one of you girls can stay at home and amuse Beth for a day or<br/>two."<br/><br/>"I shall stay, of course, I'm oldest," began Meg, looking<br/>anxious and self-reproachful.<br/><br/>"I shall, because it's my fault she is sick. I told Mother I'd<br/>do the errands, and I haven't," said Jo decidedly.<br/><br/>"Which will you have, Beth? There ain't no need of but one," aid<br/>Hannah.<br/><br/>"Jo, please." And Beth leaned her head against her sister with a<br/>contented look, which effectually settled that point.<br/><br/>
