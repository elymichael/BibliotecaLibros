They found Mr. Laurence standing before the fire in the great
drawing room, but Jo's attention was entirely absorbed by a grand
piano, which stood open.

"Do you play?" she asked, turning to Laurie with a respectful
expression.

"Sometimes," he answered modestly.

"Please do now. I want to hear it, so I can tell Beth."

"Won't you first?"

"Don't know how. Too stupid to learn, but I love music
dearly."

So Laurie played and Jo listened, with her nose luxuriously
buried in heliotrope and tea roses. Her respect and regard for the
'Laurence' boy increased very much, for he played remarkably well
and didn't put on any airs. She wished Beth could hear him, but she
did not say so, only praised him till he was quite abashed, and his
grandfather came to his rescue.

"That will do, that will do, young lady. Too many sugarplums are
not good for him. His music isn't bad, but I hope he will do as
well in more important things. Going? well, I'm much obliged to
you, and I hope you'll come again. My respects to your mother. Good
night, Doctor Jo."

He shook hands kindly, but looked as if something did not please
him. When they got into the hall, Jo asked Laurie if she had said
something amiss. He shook his head.

"No, it was me. He doesn't like to hear me play."

"Why not?"
