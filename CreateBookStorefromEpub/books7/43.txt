"Yes, ma'am. I had four, but two were killed, one is a prisoner,
and I'm going to the other, who is very sick in a Washington
hospital.' he answered quietly."

"'You have done a great deal for your country, sir,' I said,
feeling respect now, instead of pity."

"'Not a mite more than I ought, ma'am. I'd go myself, if I was
any use. As I ain't, I give my boys, and give 'em free.'"

"He spoke so cheerfully, looked so sincere, and seemed so glad
to give his all, that I was ashamed of myself. I'd given one man
and thought it too much, while he gave four without grudging them.
I had all my girls to comfort me at home, and his last son was
waiting, miles away, to say good-by to him, perhaps! I felt so
rich, so happy thinking of my blessings, that I made him a nice
bundle, gave him some money, and thanked him heartily for the
lesson he had taught me."

"Tell another story, Mother, one with a moral to it, like this.
I like to think about them afterward, if they are real and not too
preachy," said Jo, after a minute's silence.

Mrs. March smiled and began at once, for she had told stories to
this little audience for many years, and knew how to please
them.

"Once upon a time, there were four girls, who had enough to eat
and drink and wear, a good many comforts and pleasures, kind
friends and parents who loved them dearly, and yet they were not
contented." (Here the listeners stole sly looks at one another, and
began to sew diligently.) "These girls were anxious to be good and
made many excellent resolutions, but they did not keep them very
well, and were constantly saying, 'If only we had this,' or 'If we
could only do that,' quite forgetting how much they already had,
and how many things they actually could do. So they asked an old
woman what spell they could use to make them happy, and she said,
'When you feel discontented, think over your blessings, and be
grateful.'" (Here Jo looked up quickly, as if about to speak, but
changed her mind, seeing that the story was not done yet.)

"Being sensible girls, they decided to try her advice, and soon
were surprised to see how well off they were. One discovered that
money couldn't keep shame and sorrow out of rich people's houses,
another that, though she was poor, she was a great deal happier,
with her youth, health, and good spirits, than a certain fretful,
feeble old lady who couldn't enjoy her comforts, a third that,
disagreeable as it was to help get dinner, it was harder still to
go begging for it and the fourth, that even carnelian rings were
not so valuable as good behavior. So they agreed to stop
complaining, to enjoy the blessings already possessed, and try to
deserve them, lest they should be taken away entirely, instead of
increased, and I believe they were never disappointed or sorry that
they took the old woman's advice."

"Now, Marmee, that is very cunning of you to turn our own
stories against us, and give us a sermon instead of a romance!"
cried Meg.

"I like that kind of sermon. It's the sort Father used to tell
us," said Beth thoughtfully, putting the needles straight on Jo's
cushion.

"I don't complain near as much as the others do, and I shall be
more careful than ever now, for I've had warning from Susie's
downfall," said Amy morally.
