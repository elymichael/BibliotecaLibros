<br/>A pleasing fiction, by the way, for Jo had no more idea of music<br/>than a grasshopper. But she would have consented if he had proposed<br/>to sing a whole opera, and warbled away, blissfully regardless of<br/>time and tune. It didn't much matter, for Mr. Bhaer sang like a<br/>true German, heartily and well, and Jo soon subsided into a subdued<br/>hum, that she might listen to the mellow voice that seemed to sing<br/>for her alone.<br/><br/><br/>Know'st thou the land where the citron blooms,<br/><br/><br/>used to be the Professor's favorite line, for<br/>'das land' meant Germany to him, but now he seemed to dwell, with<br/>peculiar warmth and melody, upon the words…<br/><br/><br/>There, oh there, might I with thee,<br/>O, my beloved, go<br/><br/><br/>and one listener was so thrilled by the tender<br/>invitation that she longed to say she did know the land, and would<br/>joyfully depart thither whenever he liked.<br/><br/>The song was considered a great success, and the singer retired<br/>covered with laurels. But a few minutes afterward, he forgot his<br/>manners entirely, and stared at Amy putting on her bonnet, for she<br/>had been introduced simply as 'my sister', and no one had called<br/>her by her new name since he came. He forgot himself still further<br/>when Laurie said, in his most gracious manner, at parting…<br/><br/>"My wife and I are very glad to meet you, sir. Please remember<br/>that there is always a welcome waiting for you over the way."<br/><br/>Then the Professor thanked him so heartily, and looked so<br/>suddenly illuminated with satisfaction, that Laurie thought him the<br/>most delightfully demonstrative old fellow he ever met.<br/>
