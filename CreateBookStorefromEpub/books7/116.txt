The unusual spectacle of her busy mother rocking comfortably and
reading early in the morning made Jo feel as if some unnatural
phenomenon had occurred, for an eclipse, an earthquake, or a
volcanic eruption would hardly have seemed stranger.

"Everything is out of sorts, somehow," she said to herself,
going downstairs. "There's Beth crying, that's a sure sign that
something is wrong in this family. If Amy is bothering, I'll shake
her."

Feeling very much out of sorts herself, Jo hurried into the
parlor to find Beth sobbing over Pip, the canary, who lay dead in
the cage with his little claws pathetically extended, as if
imploring the food for want of which he had died.

"It's all my fault, I forgot him, there isn't a seed or a drop
left. Oh, Pip! Oh, Pip! How could I be so cruel to you?" cried
Beth, taking the poor thing in her hands and trying to restore
him.

Jo peeped into his half-open eye, felt his little heart, and
finding him stiff and cold, shook her head, and offered her domino
box for a coffin.

"Put him in the oven, and maybe he will get warm and revive,"
said Amy hopefully.

"He's been starved, and he shan't be baked now he's dead. I'll
make him a shroud, and he shall be buried in the garden, and I'll
never have another bird, never, my Pip! for I am too bad to own
one," murmured Beth, sitting on the floor with her pet folded in
her hands.

"The funeral shall be this afternoon, and we will all go. Now,
don't cry, Bethy. It's a pity, but nothing goes right this week,
and Pip has had the worst of the experiment. Make the shroud, and
lay him in my box, and after the dinner party, we'll have a nice
little funeral," said Jo, beginning to feel as if she had
undertaken a good deal.

Leaving the others to console Beth, she departed to the kitchen,
which was in a most discouraging state of confusion. Putting on a
big apron, she fell to work and got the dishes piled up ready for
washing, when she discovered that the fire was out.

"Here's a sweet prospect!" muttered Jo, slamming the stove door
open, and poking vigorously among the cinders.

Having rekindled the fire, she thought she would go to market
while the water heated. The walk revived her spirits, and
flattering herself that she had made good bargains, she trudged
home again, after buying a very young lobster, some very old
asparagus, and two boxes of acid strawberries. By the time she got
cleared up, the dinner arrived and the stove was red-hot. Hannah
had left a pan of bread to rise, Meg had worked it up early, set it
on the hearth for a second rising, and forgotten it. Meg was
entertaining Sallie Gardiner in the parlor, when the door flew open
and a floury, crocky, flushed, and disheveled figure appeared,
demanding tartlyâ€¦
