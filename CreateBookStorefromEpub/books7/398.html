"How did you ever get Aunt to agree?"<br/><br/>"It was hard work, but between us, we talked her over, for we<br/>had heaps of good reasons on our side. There wasn't time to write<br/>and ask leave, but you all liked it, had consented to it by-and-by,<br/>and it was only 'taking time by the fetlock', as my wife says."<br/><br/>"Aren't we proud of those two words, and don't we like to say<br/>them?" interrupted Jo, addressing the fire in her turn, and<br/>watching with delight the happy light it seemed to kindle in the<br/>eyes that had been so tragically gloomy when she saw them last.<br/><br/>"A trifle, perhaps, she's such a captivating little woman I<br/>can't help being proud of her. Well, then Uncle and Aunt were there<br/>to play propriety. We were so absorbed in one another we were of no<br/>mortal use apart, and that charming arrangement would make<br/>everything easy all round, so we did it."<br/><br/>"When, where, how?" asked Jo, in a fever of feminine interest<br/>and curiosity, for she could not realize it a particle.<br/><br/>"Six weeks ago, at the American consul's, in Paris, a very quiet<br/>wedding of course, for even in our happiness we didn't forget dear<br/>little Beth."<br/><br/>Jo put her hand in his as he said that, and Laurie gently<br/>smoothed the little red pillow, which he remembered well.<br/><br/>"Why didn't you let us know afterward?" asked Jo, in a quieter<br/>tone, when they had sat quite still a minute.<br/><br/>"We wanted to surprise you. We thought we were coming directly<br/>home, at first, but the dear old gentleman, as soon as we were<br/>married, found he couldn't be ready under a month, at least, and<br/>sent us off to spend our honeymoon wherever we liked. Amy had once<br/>called Valrosa a regular honeymoon home, so we went there, and were<br/>as happy as people are but once in their lives. My faith! Wasn't it<br/>love among the roses!"<br/><br/>Laurie seemed to forget Jo for a minute, and Jo was glad of it,<br/>for the fact that he told her these things so freely and so<br/>naturally assured her that he had quite forgiven and forgotten. She<br/>tried to draw away her hand, but as if he guessed the thought that<br/>prompted the half-involuntary impulse, Laurie held it fast, and<br/>said, with a manly gravity she had never seen in him beforeâ€¦<br/><br/>"Jo, dear, I want to say one thing, and then we'll put it by<br/>forever. As I told you in my letter when I wrote that Amy had been<br/>so kind to me, I never shall stop loving you, but the love is<br/>altered, and I have learned to see that it is better as it is. Amy<br/>and you changed places in my heart, that's all. I think it was<br/>meant to be so, and would have come about naturally, if I had<br/>waited, as you tried to make me, but I never could be patient, and<br/>so I got a heartache. I was a boy then, headstrong and violent, and<br/>it took a hard lesson to show me my mistake. For it was one, Jo, as<br/>you said, and I found it out, after making a fool of myself. Upon<br/>my word, I was so tumbled up in my mind, at one time, that I didn't<br/>know which I loved best, you or Amy, and tried to love you both<br/>alike. But I couldn't, and when I saw her in Switzerland,<br/>everything seemed to clear up all at once. You both got into your<br/>right places, and I felt sure that it was well off with the old<br/>love before it was on with the new, that I could honestly share my<br/>heart between sister Jo and wife Amy, and love them dearly. Will<br/>you believe it, and go back to the happy old times when we first<br/>knew one another?"<br/>
