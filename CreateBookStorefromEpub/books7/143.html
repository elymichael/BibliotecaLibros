<br/>"Yes, I should think so," and Laurie thought regretfully of his<br/>own idle days.<br/><br/>"Mother likes to have us out-of-doors as much as possible, so we<br/>bring our work here and have nice times. For the fun of it we bring<br/>our things in these bags, wear the old hats, use poles to climb the<br/>hill, and play pilgrims, as we used to do years ago. We call this<br/>hill the Delectable Mountain, for we can look far away and see the<br/>country where we hope to live some time."<br/><br/>Jo pointed, and Laurie sat up to examine, for through an opening<br/>in the wood one could look cross the wide, blue river, the meadows<br/>on the other side, far over the outskirts of the great city, to the<br/>green hills that rose to meet the sky. The sun was low, and the<br/>heavens glowed with the splendor of an autumn sunset. Gold and<br/>purple clouds lay on the hilltops, and rising high into the ruddy<br/>light were silvery white peaks that shone like the airy spires of<br/>some Celestial City.<br/><br/>"How beautiful that is!" said Laurie softly, for he was quick to<br/>see and feel beauty of any kind.<br/><br/>"It's often so, and we like to watch it, for it is never the<br/>same, but always splendid," replied Amy, wishing she could paint<br/>it.<br/><br/>"Jo talks about the country where we hope to live sometimeâ€”the<br/>real country, she means, with pigs and chickens and haymaking. It<br/>would be nice, but I wish the beautiful country up there was real,<br/>and we could ever go to it," said Beth musingly.<br/><br/>"There is a lovelier country even than that, where we shall go,<br/>by-and-by, when we are good enough," answered Meg with her sweetest<br/>voice.<br/><br/>"It seems so long to wait, so hard to do. I want to fly away at<br/>once, as those swallows fly, and go in at that splendid gate."<br/><br/>"You'll get there, Beth, sooner or later, no fear of that," said<br/>Jo. "I'm the one that will have to fight and work, and climb and<br/>wait, and maybe never get in after all."<br/><br/>"You'll have me for company, if that's any comfort. I shall have<br/>to do a deal of traveling before I come in sight of your Celestial<br/>City. If I arrive late, you'll say a good word for me, won't you,<br/>Beth?"<br/><br/>
