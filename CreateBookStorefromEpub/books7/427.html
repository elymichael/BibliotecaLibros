Four little chests all in a row,<br/>Dim with dust, and worn by time,<br/>All fashioned and filled, long ago,<br/>By children now in their prime.<br/>Four little keys hung side by side,<br/>With faded ribbons, brave and gay<br/>When fastened there, with childish pride,<br/>Long ago, on a rainy day.<br/>Four little names, one on each lid,<br/>Carved out by a boyish hand,<br/>And underneath there lieth hid<br/>Histories of the happy band<br/>Once playing here, and pausing oft<br/>To hear the sweet refrain,<br/>That came and went on the roof aloft,<br/>In the falling summer rain.<br/><br/>"Meg" on the first lid, smooth and fair.<br/>I look in with loving eyes,<br/>For folded here, with well-known care,<br/>A goodly gathering lies,<br/>
