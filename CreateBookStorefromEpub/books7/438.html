When no one could eat any more, the Professor proposed the first<br/>regular toast, which was always drunk at such times—"Aunt March,<br/>God bless her!" A toast heartily given by the good man, who never<br/>forgot how much he owed her, and quietly drunk by the boys, who had<br/>been taught to keep her memory green.<br/><br/>"Now, Grandma's sixtieth birthday! Long life to her, with three<br/>times three!"<br/><br/>That was given with a will, as you may well believe, and the<br/>cheering once begun, it was hard to stop it. Everybody's health was<br/>proposed, from Mr. Laurence, who was considered their special<br/>patron, to the astonished guinea pig, who had strayed from its<br/>proper sphere in search of its young master. Demi, as the oldest<br/>grandchild, then presented the queen of the day with various gifts,<br/>so numerous that they were transported to the festive scene in a<br/>wheelbarrow. Funny presents, some of them, but what would have been<br/>defects to other eyes were ornaments to Grandma's—for the<br/>children's gifts were all their own. Every stitch Daisy's patient<br/>little fingers had put into the handkerchiefs she hemmed was better<br/>than embroidery to Mrs. March. Demi's miracle of mechanical skill,<br/>though the cover wouldn't shut, Rob's footstool had a wiggle in its<br/>uneven legs that she declared was soothing, and no page of the<br/>costly book Amy's child gave her was so fair as that on which<br/>appeared in tipsy capitals, the words—"To dear Grandma, from her<br/>little Beth."<br/><br/>During the ceremony the boys had mysteriously disappeared, and<br/>when Mrs. March had tried to thank her children, and broken down,<br/>while Teddy wiped her eyes on his pinafore, the Professor suddenly<br/>began to sing. Then, from above him, voice after voice took up the<br/>words, and from tree to tree echoed the music of the unseen choir,<br/>as the boys sang with all their hearts the little song that Jo had<br/>written, Laurie set to music, and the Professor trained his lads to<br/>give with the best effect. This was something altogether new, and<br/>it proved a grand success, for Mrs. March couldn't get over her<br/>surprise, and insisted on shaking hands with every one of the<br/>featherless birds, from tall Franz and Emil to the little quadroon,<br/>who had the sweetest voice of all.<br/><br/>After this, the boys dispersed for a final lark, leaving Mrs.<br/>March and her daughters under the festival tree.<br/><br/>"I don't think I ever ought to call myself 'unlucky Jo' again,<br/>when my greatest wish has been so beautifully gratified," said Mrs.<br/>Bhaer, taking Teddy's little fist out of the milk pitcher, in which<br/>he was rapturously churning.<br/><br/>"And yet your life is very different from the one you pictured<br/>so long ago. Do you remember our castles in the air?" asked Amy,<br/>smiling as she watched Laurie and John playing cricket with the<br/>boys.<br/><br/>"Dear fellows! It does my heart good to see them forget business<br/>and frolic for a day," answered Jo, who now spoke in a maternal way<br/>of all mankind. "Yes, I remember, but the life I wanted then seems<br/>selfish, lonely, and cold to me now. I haven't given up the hope<br/>that I may write a good book yet, but I can wait, and I'm sure it<br/>will be all the better for such experiences and illustrations as<br/>these," and Jo pointed from the lively lads in the distance to her<br/>father, leaning on the Professor's arm, as they walked to and fro<br/>in the sunshine, deep in one of the conversations which both<br/>enjoyed so much, and then to her mother, sitting enthroned among<br/>her daughters, with their children in her lap and at her feet, as<br/>if all found help and happiness in the face which never could grow<br/>old to them.<br/><br/>"My castle was the most nearly realized of all. I asked for<br/>splendid things, to be sure, but in my heart I knew I should be<br/>satisfied, if I had a little home, and John, and some dear children<br/>like these. I've got them all, thank God, and am the happiest woman<br/>in the world," and Meg laid her hand on her tall boy's head, with a<br/>face full of tender and devout content.<br/><br/>"My castle is very different from what I planned, but I would<br/>not alter it, though, like Jo, I don't relinquish all my artistic<br/>hopes, or confine myself to helping others fulfill their dreams of<br/>beauty. I've begun to model a figure of baby, and Laurie says it is<br/>the best thing I've ever done. I think so, myself, and mean to do<br/>it in marble, so that, whatever happens, I may at least keep the<br/>image of my little angel."<br/><br/>As Amy spoke, a great tear dropped on the golden hair of the<br/>sleeping child in her arms, for her one well-beloved daughter was a<br/>frail little creature and the dread of losing her was the shadow<br/>over Amy's sunshine. This cross was doing much for both father and<br/>mother, for one love and sorrow bound them closely together. Amy's<br/>nature was growing sweeter, deeper, and more tender. Laurie was<br/>growing more serious, strong, and firm, and both were learning that<br/>beauty, youth, good fortune, even love itself, cannot keep care and<br/>pain, loss and sorrow, from the most blessed for&#160;…<br/>
