<br/>It was a very long day and a hard one for Amy, as she sat behind<br/>her table, often quite alone, for the little girls deserted very<br/>soon. Few cared to buy flowers in summer, and her bouquets began to<br/>droop long before night.<br/><br/>The art table was the most attractive in the room. There was a<br/>crowd about it all day long, and the tenders were constantly flying<br/>to and fro with important faces and rattling money boxes. Amy often<br/>looked wistfully across, longing to be there, where she felt at<br/>home and happy, instead of in a corner with nothing to do. It might<br/>seem no hardship to some of us, but to a pretty, blithe young girl,<br/>it was not only tedious, but very trying, and the thought of Laurie<br/>and his friends made it a real martyrdom.<br/><br/>She did not go home till night, and then she looked so pale and<br/>quiet that they knew the day had been a hard one, though she made<br/>no complaint, and did not even tell what she had done. Her mother<br/>gave her an extra cordial cup of tea. Beth helped her dress, and<br/>made a charming little wreath for her hair, while Jo astonished her<br/>family by getting herself up with unusual care, and hinting darkly<br/>that the tables were about to be turned.<br/><br/>"Don't do anything rude, pray Jo; I won't have any fuss made, so<br/>let it all pass and behave yourself," begged Amy, as she departed<br/>early, hoping to find a reinforcement of flowers to refresh her<br/>poor little table.<br/><br/>"I merely intend to make myself entrancingly agreeable to every<br/>one I know, and to keep them in your corner as long as possible.<br/>Teddy and his boys will lend a hand, and we'll have a good time<br/>yet." returned Jo, leaning over the gate to watch for Laurie.<br/>Presently the familiar tramp was heard in the dusk, and she ran out<br/>to meet him.<br/><br/>"Is that my boy?"<br/><br/>"As sure as this is my girl!" and Laurie tucked her hand under<br/>his arm with the air of a man whose every wish was gratified.<br/><br/>"Oh, Teddy, such doings!" and Jo told Amy's wrongs with sisterly<br/>zeal.<br/><br/>"A flock of our fellows are going to drive over by-and-by, and<br/>I'll be hanged if I don't make them buy every flower she's got, and<br/>camp down before her table afterward," said Laurie, espousing her<br/>cause with warmth.<br/><br/>"The flowers are not at all nice, Amy says, and the fresh ones<br/>may not arrive in time. I don't wish to be unjust or suspicious,<br/>but I shouldn't wonder if they never came at all. When people do<br/>one mean thing they are very likely to do another," observed Jo in<br/>a disgusted tone.<br/><br/>
