"And so you shall, like an angel as you are!" cried Laurie,
resolving, with a glow of philanthropic zeal, to found and endow an
institution for the express benefit of young women with artistic
tendencies. "Rich people have no right to sit down and enjoy
themselves, or let their money accumulate for others to waste. It's
not half so sensible to leave legacies when one dies as it is to
use the money wisely while alive, and enjoy making one's fellow
creatures happy with it. We'll have a good time ourselves, and add
an extra relish to our own pleasure by giving other people a
generous taste. Will you be a little Dorcas, going about emptying a
big basket of comforts, and filling it up with good deeds?"

"With all my heart, if you will be a brave St. Martin, stopping
as you ride gallantly through the world to share your cloak with
the beggar."

"It's a bargain, and we shall get the best of it!"

So the young pair shook hands upon it, and then paced happily on
again, feeling that their pleasant home was more homelike because
they hoped to brighten other homes, believing that their own feet
would walk more uprightly along the flowery path before them, if
they smoothed rough ways for other feet, and feeling that their
hearts were more closely knit together by a love which could
tenderly remember those less blest than they.
