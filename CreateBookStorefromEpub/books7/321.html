JANUARY<br/><br/>A Happy New Year to you all, my dearest family,<br/>which of course includes Mr. L. and a young man by the name of<br/>Teddy. I can't tell you how much I enjoyed your Christmas bundle,<br/>for I didn't get it till night and had given up hoping. Your letter<br/>came in the morning, but you said nothing about a parcel, meaning<br/>it for a surprise, so I was disappointed, for I'd had a 'kind of<br/>feeling' that you wouldn't forget me. I felt a little low in my<br/>mind as I sat up in my room after tea, and when the big, muddy,<br/>battered-looking bundle was brought to me, I just hugged it and<br/>pranced. It was so homey and refreshing that I sat down on the<br/>floor and read and looked and ate and laughed and cried, in my<br/>usual absurd way. The things were just what I wanted, and all the<br/>better for being made instead of bought. Beth's new 'ink bib' was<br/>capital, and Hannah's box of hard gingerbread will be a treasure.<br/>I'll be sure and wear the nice flannels you sent, Marmee, and read<br/>carefully the books Father has marked. Thank you all, heaps and<br/>heaps!<br/><br/>Speaking of books reminds me that I'm getting<br/>rich in that line, for on New Year's Day Mr. Bhaer gave me a fine<br/>Shakespeare. It is one he values much, and I've often admired it,<br/>set up in the place of honor with his German Bible, Plato, Homer,<br/>and Milton, so you may imagine how I felt when he brought it down,<br/>without its cover, and showed me my own name in it, "from my friend<br/>Friedrich Bhaer".<br/><br/>"You say often you wish a library. Here I gif you<br/>one, for between these lids (he meant covers) is many books in one.<br/>Read him well, and he will help you much, for the study of<br/>character in this book will help you to read it in the world and<br/>paint it with your pen."<br/><br/>I thanked him as well as I could, and talk now<br/>about 'my library', as if I had a hundred books. I never knew how<br/>much there was in Shakespeare before, but then I never had a Bhaer<br/>to explain it to me. Now don't laugh at his horrid name. It isn't<br/>pronounced either Bear or Beer, as people will say it, but<br/>something between the two, as only Germans can give it. I'm glad<br/>you both like what I tell you about him, and hope you will know him<br/>some day. Mother would admire his warm heart, Father his wise head.<br/>I admire both, and feel rich in my new 'friend Friedrich<br/>Bhaer'.<br/><br/>Not having much money, or knowing what he'd like,<br/>I got several little things, and put them about the room, where he<br/>would find them unexpectedly. They were useful, pretty, or funny, a<br/>new standish on his table, a little vase for his flower, he always<br/>has one, or a bit of green in a glass, to keep him fresh, he says,<br/>and a holder for his blower, so that he needn't burn up what Amy<br/>calls 'mouchoirs'. I made it like those Beth invented, a big<br/>butterfly with a fat body, and black and yellow wings, worsted<br/>feelers, and bead eyes. It took his fancy immensely, and he put it<br/>on his mantlepiece as an article of virtue, so it was rather a<br/>failure after all. Poor as he is, he didn't forget a servant or a<br/>child in the house, and not a soul here, from the French<br/>laundrywoman to Miss Norton forgot him. I was so glad of that.<br/><br/>They got up a masquerade, and had a gay time New<br/>Year's Eve. I didn't mean to go down, having no dress. But at the<br/>last minute, Mrs. Kirke remembered some old brocades, and Miss<br/>Norton lent me lace and feathers. So I dressed up as Mrs. Malaprop,<br/>and sailed in with a mask on. No one knew me, for I disguised my<br/>voice, and no one dreamed of the silent, haughty Miss March (for<br/>they think I am very stiff and cool, most of them, and so I am to<br/>whippersnappers) could dance and dress, and burst out into a 'nice<br/>derangement of epitaphs, like an allegory on the banks of the<br/>Nile'. I enjoyed it very much, and when we unmasked it was fun to<br/>see them stare at me. I heard one of the young men tell another<br/>that he knew I'd been an actress, in fact, he thought he remembered<br/>seeing me at one of the minor theaters. Meg will relish that joke.<br/>Mr. Bhaer was Nick Bottom, and Tina was Titania, a perfect little<br/>fairy in his arms. To see them dance was 'quite a landscape', to<br/>use a Teddyism.<br/><br/>I had a very happy New Year, after all, and when<br/>I thought it over in my room, I felt as if I was getting on a<br/>little in spite of my many failures, for I'm cheerful all the time<br/>now, work with a will, and take more interest in other people than<br/>I used to, which is satisfactory. Bless you all! Ever your lovingâ€¦<br/>Jo<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
