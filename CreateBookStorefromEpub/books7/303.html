<br/>Mrs. March glanced at Jo as she spoke, but the face opposite<br/>seemed quite unconscious of any secret disquietude but Beth's, and<br/>after sewing thoughtfully for a minute, Jo said, "I think she is<br/>growing up, and so begins to dream dreams, and have hopes and fears<br/>and fidgets, without knowing why or being able to explain them.<br/>Why, Mother, Beth's eighteen, but we don't realize it, and treat<br/>her like a child, forgetting she's a woman."<br/><br/>"So she is. Dear heart, how fast you do grow up," returned her<br/>mother with a sigh and a smile.<br/><br/>"Can't be helped, Marmee, so you must resign yourself to all<br/>sorts of worries, and let your birds hop out of the nest, one by<br/>one. I promise never to hop very far, if that is any comfort to<br/>you."<br/><br/>"It's a great comfort, Jo. I always feel strong when you are at<br/>home, now Meg is gone. Beth is too feeble and Amy too young to<br/>depend upon, but when the tug comes, you are always ready."<br/><br/>"Why, you know I don't mind hard jobs much, and there must<br/>always be one scrub in a family. Amy is splendid in fine works and<br/>I'm not, but I feel in my element when all the carpets are to be<br/>taken up, or half the family fall sick at once. Amy is<br/>distinguishing herself abroad, but if anything is amiss at home,<br/>I'm your man."<br/><br/>"I leave Beth to your hands, then, for she will open her tender<br/>little heart to her Jo sooner than to anyone else. Be very kind,<br/>and don't let her think anyone watches or talks about her. If she<br/>only would get quite strong and cheerful again, I shouldn't have a<br/>wish in the world."<br/><br/>"Happy woman! I've got heaps."<br/><br/>"My dear, what are they?"<br/><br/>"I'll settle Bethy's troubles, and then I'll tell you mine. They<br/>are not very wearing, so they'll keep." and Jo stitched away, with<br/>a wise nod which set her mother's heart at rest about her for the<br/>present at least.<br/><br/>While apparently absorbed in her own affairs, Jo watched Beth,<br/>and after many conflicting conjectures, finally settled upon one<br/>which seemed to explain the change in her. A slight incident gave<br/>Jo the clue to the mystery, she thought, and lively fancy, loving<br/>heart did the rest. She was affecting to write busily one Saturday<br/>afternoon, when she and Beth were alone together. Yet as she<br/>scribbled, she kept her eye on her sister, who seemed unusually<br/>quiet. Sitting at the window, Beth's work often dropped into her<br/>lap, and she leaned her head upon her hand, in a dejected attitude,<br/>while her eyes rested on the dull, autumnal landscape. Suddenly<br/>some one passed below, whistling like an operatic blackbird, and a<br/>voice called out, "All serene! Coming in tonight."<br/><br/>
