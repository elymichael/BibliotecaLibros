<br/>"My dear, go out to service in that great boarding house!" and<br/>Mrs. March looked surprised, but not displeased.<br/><br/>"It's not exactly going out to service, for Mrs. Kirke is your<br/>friend—the kindest soul that ever lived—and would make things<br/>pleasant for me, I know. Her family is separate from the rest, and<br/>no one knows me there. Don't care if they do. It's honest work, and<br/>I'm not ashamed of it."<br/><br/>"Nor I. But your writing?"<br/><br/>"All the better for the change. I shall see and hear new things,<br/>get new ideas, and even if I haven't much time there, I shall bring<br/>home quantities of material for my rubbish."<br/><br/>"I have no doubt of it, but are these your only reasons for this<br/>sudden fancy?"<br/><br/>"No, Mother."<br/><br/>"May I know the others?"<br/><br/>Jo looked up and Jo looked down, then said slowly, with sudden<br/>color in her cheeks. "It may be vain and wrong to say it, but—I'm<br/>afraid—Laurie is getting too fond of me."<br/><br/>"Then you don't care for him in the way it is evident he begins<br/>to care for you?" and Mrs. March looked anxious as she put the<br/>question.<br/><br/>"Mercy, no! I love the dear boy, as I always have, and am<br/>immensely proud of him, but as for anything more, it's out of the<br/>question."<br/><br/>
