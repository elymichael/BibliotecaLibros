"I'm sorry for that, and ought to thank him for not shaking me,
I suppose. What the dickens does the fellow expect?" and the old
gentleman looked a trifle ashamed of his own testiness.

"If I were you, I'd write him an apology, Sir. He says he won't
come down till he has one, and talks about Washington, and goes on
in an absurd way. A formal apology will make him see how foolish he
is, and bring him down quite amiable. Try it. He likes fun, and
this way is better than talking. I'll carry it up, and teach him
his duty."

Mr. Laurence gave her a sharp look, and put on his spectacles,
saying slowly, "You're a sly puss, but I don't mind being managed
by you and Beth. Here, give me a bit of paper, and let us have done
with this nonsense."

The note was written in the terms which one gentleman would use
to another after offering some deep insult. Jo dropped a kiss on
the top of Mr. Laurence's bald head, and ran up to slip the apology
under Laurie's door, advising him through the keyhole to be
submissive, decorous, and a few other agreeable impossibilities.
Finding the door locked again, she left the note to do its work,
and was going quietly away, when the young gentleman slid down the
banisters, and waited for her at the bottom, saying, with his most
virtuous expression of countenance, "What a good fellow you are,
Jo! Did you get blown up?" he added, laughing.

"No, he was pretty mild, on the whole."

"Ah! I got it all round. Even you cast me off over there, and I
felt just ready to go to the deuce," he began apologetically.

"Don't talk that way, turn over a new leaf and begin again,
Teddy, my son."

"I keep turning over new leaves, and spoiling them, as I used to
spoil my copybooks, and I make so many beginnings there never will
be an end," he said dolefully.

"Go and eat your dinner, you'll feel better after it. Men always
croak when they are hungry," and Jo whisked out at the front door
after that.

"That's a 'label' on my 'sect'," answered Laurie, quoting Amy,
as he went to partake of humble pie dutifully with his grandfather,
who was quite saintly in temper and overwhelmingly respectful in
manner all the rest of the day.
