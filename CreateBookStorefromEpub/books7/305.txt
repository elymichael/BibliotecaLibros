"No slang," snapped Jo, slamming down the pillow. But it was too
late, there was no room for it, and coasting onto the floor, it
disappeared in a most mysterious manner.

"Come, Jo, don't be thorny. After studying himself to a skeleton
all the week, a fellow deserves petting and ought to get it."

"Beth will pet you. I'm busy."

"No, she's not to be bothered with me, but you like that sort of
thing, unless you've suddenly lost your taste for it. Have you? Do
you hate your boy, and want to fire pillows at him?"

Anything more wheedlesome than that touching appeal was seldom
heard, but Jo quenched 'her boy' by turning on him with a stern
query, "How many bouquets have you sent Miss Randal this week?"

"Not one, upon my word. She's engaged. Now then."

"I'm glad of it, that's one of your foolish extravagances,
sending flowers and things to girls for whom you don't care two
pins," continued Jo reprovingly.

"Sensible girls for whom I do care whole papers of pins won't
let me send them 'flowers and things', so what can I do? My
feelings need a 'vent'."

"Mother doesn't approve of flirting even in fun, and you do
flirt desperately, Teddy."

"I'd give anything if I could answer, 'So do you'. As I can't,
I'll merely say that I don't see any harm in that pleasant little
game, if all parties understand that it's only play."
