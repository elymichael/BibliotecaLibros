"Here's Mother, dear, and you shall have another bird tomorrow,<br/>if you want it."<br/><br/>As she spoke, Mrs. March came and took her place among them,<br/>looking as if her holiday had not been much pleasanter than<br/>theirs.<br/><br/>"Are you satisfied with your experiment, girls, or do you want<br/>another week of it?" she asked, as Beth nestled up to her and the<br/>rest turned toward her with brightening faces, as flowers turn<br/>toward the sun.<br/><br/>"I don't!" cried Jo decidedly.<br/><br/>"Nor I," echoed the others.<br/><br/>"You think then, that it is better to have a few duties and live<br/>a little for others, do you?"<br/><br/>"Lounging and larking doesn't pay," observed Jo, shaking her<br/>head. "I'm tired of it and mean to go to work at something right<br/>off."<br/><br/>"Suppose you learn plain cooking. That's a useful<br/>accomplishment, which no woman should be without," said Mrs. March,<br/>laughing inaudibly at the recollection of Jo's dinner party, for<br/>she had met Miss Crocker and heard her account of it.<br/><br/>"Mother, did you go away and let everything be, just to see how<br/>we'd get on?" cried Meg, who had had suspicions all day.<br/><br/>"Yes, I wanted you to see how the comfort of all depends on each<br/>doing her share faithfully. While Hannah and I did your work, you<br/>got on pretty well, though I don't think you were very happy or<br/>amiable. So I thought, as a little lesson, I would show you what<br/>happens when everyone thinks only of herself. Don't you feel that<br/>it is pleasanter to help one another, to have daily duties which<br/>make leisure sweet when it comes, and to bear and forbear, that<br/>home may be comfortable and lovely to us all?"<br/><br/>"We do, Mother, we do!" cried the girls.<br/>
