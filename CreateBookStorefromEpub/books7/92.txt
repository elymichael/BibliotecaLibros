"Silence a la mort," replied Laurie, with a melodramatic
flourish, as he went away.

This little bit of byplay excited Annie's curiosity, but Meg was
too tired for gossip and went to bed, feeling as if she had been to
a masquerade and hadn't enjoyed herself as much as she expected.
She was sick all the next day, and on Saturday went home, quite
used up with her fortnight's fun and feeling that she had 'sat in
the lap of luxury' long enough.

"It does seem pleasant to be quiet, and not have company manners
on all the time. Home is a nice place, though it isn't splendid,"
said Meg, looking about her with a restful expression, as she sat
with her mother and Jo on the Sunday evening.

"I'm glad to hear you say so, dear, for I was afraid home would
seem dull and poor to you after your fine quarters," replied her
mother, who had given her many anxious looks that day. For motherly
eyes are quick to see any change in children's faces.

Meg had told her adventures gayly and said over and over what a
charming time she had had, but something still seemed to weigh upon
her spirits, and when the younger girls were gone to bed, she sat
thoughtfully staring at the fire, saying little and looking
worried. As the clock struck nine and Jo proposed bed, Meg suddenly
left her chair and, taking Beth's stool, leaned her elbows on her
mother's knee, saying bravelyâ€¦

"Marmee, I want to 'fess'."

"I thought so. What is it, dear?"

"Shall I go away?" asked Jo discreetly.

"Of course not. Don't I always tell you everything? I was
ashamed to speak of it before the younger children, but I want you
to know all the dreadful things I did at the Moffats'."

"We are prepared," said Mrs. March, smiling but looking a little
anxious.
