<br/>Jo wrote no more sensational stories, deciding that the money<br/>did not pay for her share of the sensation, but going to the other<br/>extreme, as is the way with people of her stamp, she took a course<br/>of Mrs. Sherwood, Miss Edgeworth, and Hannah More, and then<br/>produced a tale which might have been more properly called an essay<br/>or a sermon, so intensely moral was it. She had her doubts about it<br/>from the beginning, for her lively fancy and girlish romance felt<br/>as ill at ease in the new style as she would have done masquerading<br/>in the stiff and cumbrous costume of the last century. She sent<br/>this didactic gem to several markets, but it found no purchaser,<br/>and she was inclined to agree with Mr. Dashwood that morals didn't<br/>sell.<br/><br/>Then she tried a child's story, which she could easily have<br/>disposed of if she had not been mercenary enough to demand filthy<br/>lucre for it. The only person who offered enough to make it worth<br/>her while to try juvenile literature was a worthy gentleman who<br/>felt it his mission to convert all the world to his particular<br/>belief. But much as she liked to write for children, Jo could not<br/>consent to depict all her naughty boys as being eaten by bears or<br/>tossed by mad bulls because they did not go to a particular Sabbath<br/>school, nor all the good infants who did go as rewarded by every<br/>kind of bliss, from gilded gingerbread to escorts of angels when<br/>they departed this life with psalms or sermons on their lisping<br/>tongues. So nothing came of these trials, and Jo corked up her<br/>inkstand, and said in a fit of very wholesome humilityâ€¦<br/><br/>"I don't know anything. I'll wait until I do before I try again,<br/>and meantime, 'sweep mud in the street' if I can't do better,<br/>that's honest, at least." Which decision proved that her second<br/>tumble down the beanstalk had done her some good.<br/><br/>While these internal revolutions were going on, her external<br/>life had been as busy and uneventful as usual, and if she sometimes<br/>looked serious or a little sad no one observed it but Professor<br/>Bhaer. He did it so quietly that Jo never knew he was watching to<br/>see if she would accept and profit by his reproof, but she stood<br/>the test, and he was satisfied, for though no words passed between<br/>them, he knew that she had given up writing. Not only did he guess<br/>it by the fact that the second finger of her right hand was no<br/>longer inky, but she spent her evenings downstairs now, was met no<br/>more among newspaper offices, and studied with a dogged patience,<br/>which assured him that she was bent on occupying her mind with<br/>something useful, if not pleasant.<br/><br/>He helped her in many ways, proving himself a true friend, and<br/>Jo was happy, for while her pen lay idle, she was learning other<br/>lessons besides German, and laying a foundation for the sensation<br/>story of her own life.<br/><br/>It was a pleasant winter and a long one, for she did not leave<br/>Mrs. Kirke till June. Everyone seemed sorry when the time came. The<br/>children were inconsolable, and Mr. Bhaer's hair stuck straight up<br/>all over his head, for he always rumpled it wildly when disturbed<br/>in mind.<br/><br/>"Going home? Ah, you are happy that you haf a home to go in," he<br/>said, when she told him, and sat silently pulling his beard in the<br/>corner, while she held a little levee on that last evening.<br/><br/>She was going early, so she bade them all goodbye overnight, and<br/>when his turn came, she said warmly, "Now, Sir, you won't forget to<br/>come and see us, if you ever travel our way, will you? I'll never<br/>forgive you if you do, for I want them all to know my friend."<br/><br/>"Do you? Shall I come?" he asked, looking down at her with an<br/>eager expression which she did not see.<br/><br/>"Yes, come next month. Laurie graduates then, and you'd enjoy<br/>commencement as something new."<br/><br/>
