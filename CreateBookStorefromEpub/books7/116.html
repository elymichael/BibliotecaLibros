The unusual spectacle of her busy mother rocking comfortably and<br/>reading early in the morning made Jo feel as if some unnatural<br/>phenomenon had occurred, for an eclipse, an earthquake, or a<br/>volcanic eruption would hardly have seemed stranger.<br/><br/>"Everything is out of sorts, somehow," she said to herself,<br/>going downstairs. "There's Beth crying, that's a sure sign that<br/>something is wrong in this family. If Amy is bothering, I'll shake<br/>her."<br/><br/>Feeling very much out of sorts herself, Jo hurried into the<br/>parlor to find Beth sobbing over Pip, the canary, who lay dead in<br/>the cage with his little claws pathetically extended, as if<br/>imploring the food for want of which he had died.<br/><br/>"It's all my fault, I forgot him, there isn't a seed or a drop<br/>left. Oh, Pip! Oh, Pip! How could I be so cruel to you?" cried<br/>Beth, taking the poor thing in her hands and trying to restore<br/>him.<br/><br/>Jo peeped into his half-open eye, felt his little heart, and<br/>finding him stiff and cold, shook her head, and offered her domino<br/>box for a coffin.<br/><br/>"Put him in the oven, and maybe he will get warm and revive,"<br/>said Amy hopefully.<br/><br/>"He's been starved, and he shan't be baked now he's dead. I'll<br/>make him a shroud, and he shall be buried in the garden, and I'll<br/>never have another bird, never, my Pip! for I am too bad to own<br/>one," murmured Beth, sitting on the floor with her pet folded in<br/>her hands.<br/><br/>"The funeral shall be this afternoon, and we will all go. Now,<br/>don't cry, Bethy. It's a pity, but nothing goes right this week,<br/>and Pip has had the worst of the experiment. Make the shroud, and<br/>lay him in my box, and after the dinner party, we'll have a nice<br/>little funeral," said Jo, beginning to feel as if she had<br/>undertaken a good deal.<br/><br/>Leaving the others to console Beth, she departed to the kitchen,<br/>which was in a most discouraging state of confusion. Putting on a<br/>big apron, she fell to work and got the dishes piled up ready for<br/>washing, when she discovered that the fire was out.<br/><br/>"Here's a sweet prospect!" muttered Jo, slamming the stove door<br/>open, and poking vigorously among the cinders.<br/><br/>Having rekindled the fire, she thought she would go to market<br/>while the water heated. The walk revived her spirits, and<br/>flattering herself that she had made good bargains, she trudged<br/>home again, after buying a very young lobster, some very old<br/>asparagus, and two boxes of acid strawberries. By the time she got<br/>cleared up, the dinner arrived and the stove was red-hot. Hannah<br/>had left a pan of bread to rise, Meg had worked it up early, set it<br/>on the hearth for a second rising, and forgotten it. Meg was<br/>entertaining Sallie Gardiner in the parlor, when the door flew open<br/>and a floury, crocky, flushed, and disheveled figure appeared,<br/>demanding tartlyâ€¦<br/>
