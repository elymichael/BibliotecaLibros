Amy was gratified, but of course didn't show it, and demurely
answered, "Foreign life polishes one in spite of one's self. I
study as well as play, and as for this"—with a little gesture
toward her dress—"why, tulle is cheap, posies to be had for
nothing, and I am used to making the most of my poor little
things."

Amy rather regretted that last sentence, fearing it wasn't in
good taste, but Laurie liked her better for it, and found himself
both admiring and respecting the brave patience that made the most
of opportunity, and the cheerful spirit that covered poverty with
flowers. Amy did not know why he looked at her so kindly, nor why
he filled up her book with his own name, and devoted himself to her
for the rest of the evening in the most delightful manner; but the
impulse that wrought this agreeable change was the result of one of
the new impressions which both of them were unconsciously giving
and receiving.
