"Begging your pardon, ma'am, it wasn't a billiard saloon, but a
gymnasium, and I was taking a lesson in fencing."

"I'm glad of that."

"Why?"

"You can teach me, and then when we play&#160;
Hamlet
,
you can be Laertes, and we'll make a fine thing of the fencing
scene."

Laurie burst out with a hearty boy's laugh, which made several
passers-by smile in spite of themselves.

"I'll teach you whether we play&#160;
Hamlet
&#160;or
not. It's grand fun and will straighten you up capitally. But I
don't believe that was your only reason for saying 'I'm glad' in
that decided way, was it now?"

"No, I was glad that you were not in the saloon, because I hope
you never go to such places. Do you?"

"Not often."

"I wish you wouldn't."
