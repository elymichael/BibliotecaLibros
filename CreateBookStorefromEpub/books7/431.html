<br/>Four little chests all in a row,<br/>Dim with dust, and worn by time,<br/>Four women, taught by weal and woe<br/>To love and labor in their prime.<br/>Four sisters, parted for an hour,<br/>None lost, one only gone before,<br/>Made by love's immortal power,<br/>Nearest and dearest evermore.<br/>Oh, when these hidden stores of ours<br/>Lie open to the Father's sight,<br/>May they be rich in golden hours,<br/>Deeds that show fairer for the light,<br/>Lives whose brave music long shall ring,<br/>Like a spirit-stirring strain,<br/>Souls that shall gladly soar and sing<br/>In the long sunshine after rain.<br/><br/><br/>"It's very bad poetry, but I felt it when I wrote it, one day<br/>when I was very lonely, and had a good cry on a rag bag. I never<br/>thought it would go where it could tell tales," said Jo, tearing up<br/>the verses the Professor had treasured so long.<br/><br/>
