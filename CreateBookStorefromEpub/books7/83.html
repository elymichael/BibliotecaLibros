"You said the other day that you'd be perfectly happy if you<br/>could only go to Annie Moffat's," observed Beth in her quiet<br/>way.<br/><br/>"So I did! Well, I am happy, and I won't fret, but it does seem<br/>as if the more one gets the more one wants, doesn't it? There now,<br/>the trays are ready, and everything in but my ball dress, which I<br/>shall leave for Mother to pack," said Meg, cheering up, as she<br/>glanced from the half-filled trunk to the many times pressed and<br/>mended white tarlaton, which she called her 'ball dress' with an<br/>important air.<br/><br/>The next day was fine, and Meg departed in style for a fortnight<br/>of novelty and pleasure. Mrs. March had consented to the visit<br/>rather reluctantly, fearing that Margaret would come back more<br/>discontented than she went. But she begged so hard, and Sallie had<br/>promised to take good care of her, and a little pleasure seemed so<br/>delightful after a winter of irksome work that the mother yielded,<br/>and the daughter went to take her first taste of fashionable<br/>life.<br/><br/>The Moffats were very fashionable, and simple Meg was rather<br/>daunted, at first, by the splendor of the house and the elegance of<br/>its occupants. But they were kindly people, in spite of the<br/>frivolous life they led, and soon put their guest at her ease.<br/>Perhaps Meg felt, without understanding why, that they were not<br/>particularly cultivated or intelligent people, and that all their<br/>gilding could not quite conceal the ordinary material of which they<br/>were made. It certainly was agreeable to fare sumptuously, drive in<br/>a fine carriage, wear her best frock every day, and do nothing but<br/>enjoy herself. It suited her exactly, and soon she began to imitate<br/>the manners and conversation of those about her, to put on little<br/>airs and graces, use French phrases, crimp her hair, take in her<br/>dresses, and talk about the fashions as well as she could. The more<br/>she saw of Annie Moffat's pretty things, the more she envied her<br/>and sighed to be rich. Home now looked bare and dismal as she<br/>thought of it, work grew harder than ever, and she felt that she<br/>was a very destitute and much-injured girl, in spite of the new<br/>gloves and silk stockings.<br/><br/>She had not much time for repining, however, for the three young<br/>girls were busily employed in 'having a good time'. They shopped,<br/>walked, rode, and called all day, went to theaters and operas or<br/>frolicked at home in the evening, for Annie had many friends and<br/>knew how to entertain them. Her older sisters were very fine young<br/>ladies, and one was engaged, which was extremely interesting and<br/>romantic, Meg thought. Mr. Moffat was a fat, jolly old gentleman,<br/>who knew her father, and Mrs. Moffat, a fat, jolly old lady, who<br/>took as great a fancy to Meg as her daughter had done. Everyone<br/>petted her, and 'Daisey', as they called her, was in a fair way to<br/>have her head turned.<br/><br/>When the evening for the small party came, she found that the<br/>poplin wouldn't do at all, for the other girls were putting on thin<br/>dresses and making themselves very fine indeed. So out came the<br/>tarlatan, looking older, limper, and shabbier than ever beside<br/>Sallie's crisp new one. Meg saw the girls glance at it and then at<br/>one another, and her cheeks began to burn, for with all her<br/>gentleness she was very proud. No one said a word about it, but<br/>Sallie offered to dress her hair, and Annie to tie her sash, and<br/>Belle, the engaged sister, praised her white arms. But in their<br/>kindness Meg saw only pity for her poverty, and her heart felt very<br/>heavy as she stood by herself, while the others laughed, chattered,<br/>and flew about like gauzy butterflies. The hard, bitter feeling was<br/>getting pretty bad, when the maid brought in a box of flowers.<br/>Before she could speak, Annie had the cover off, and all were<br/>exclaiming at the lovely roses, heath, and fern within.<br/><br/>"It's for Belle, of course, George always sends her some, but<br/>these are altogether ravishing," cried Annie, with a great<br/>sniff.<br/><br/>"They are for Miss March, the man said. And here's a note," put<br/>in the maid, holding it to Meg.<br/><br/>"What fun! Who are they from? Didn't know you had a lover,"<br/>cried the girls, fluttering about Meg in a high state of curiosity<br/>and surprise.<br/><br/>"The note is from Mother, and the flowers from Laurie," said Meg<br/>simply, yet much gratified that he had not forgotten her.<br/><br/>"Oh, indeed!" said Annie with a funny look, as Meg slipped the<br/>note into her pocket as a sort of talisman against envy, vanity,<br/>and false pride, for the few loving words had done her good, and<br/>the flowers cheered her up by their beauty.<br/>
