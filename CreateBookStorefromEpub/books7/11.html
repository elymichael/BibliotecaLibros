"Not quite," replied Jo modestly. "I do think&#160;<br/>The<br/>Witches Curse, an Operatic Tragedy<br/>&#160;is rather a nice<br/>thing, but I'd like to try<br/>Macbeth<br/>, if we only had a<br/>trapdoor for Banquo. I always wanted to do the killing part. 'Is<br/>that a dagger that I see before me?" muttered Jo, rolling her eyes<br/>and clutching at the air, as she had seen a famous tragedian<br/>do.<br/><br/>"No, it's the toasting fork, with Mother's shoe on it instead of<br/>the bread. Beth's stage-struck!" cried Meg, and the rehearsal ended<br/>in a general burst of laughter.<br/><br/>"Glad to find you so merry, my girls," said a cheery voice at<br/>the door, and actors and audience turned to welcome a tall,<br/>motherly lady with a 'can I help you' look about her which was<br/>truly delightful. She was not elegantly dressed, but a<br/>noble-looking woman, and the girls thought the gray cloak and<br/>unfashionable bonnet covered the most splendid mother in the<br/>world.<br/><br/>"Well, dearies, how have you got on today? There was so much to<br/>do, getting the boxes ready to go tomorrow, that I didn't come home<br/>to dinner. Has anyone called, Beth? How is your cold, Meg? Jo, you<br/>look tired to death. Come and kiss me, baby."<br/><br/>While making these maternal inquiries Mrs. March got her wet<br/>things off, her warm slippers on, and sitting down in the easy<br/>chair, drew Amy to her lap, preparing to enjoy the happiest hour of<br/>her busy day. The girls flew about, trying to make things<br/>comfortable, each in her own way. Meg arranged the tea table, Jo<br/>brought wood and set chairs, dropping, over-turning, and clattering<br/>everything she touched. Beth trotted to and fro between parlor<br/>kitchen, quiet and busy, while Amy gave directions to everyone, as<br/>she sat with her hands folded.<br/><br/>As they gathered about the table, Mrs. March said, with a<br/>particularly happy face, "I've got a treat for you after<br/>supper."<br/><br/>A quick, bright smile went round like a streak of sunshine. Beth<br/>clapped her hands, regardless of the biscuit she held, and Jo<br/>tossed up her napkin, crying, "A letter! A letter! Three cheers for<br/>Father!"<br/><br/>"Yes, a nice long letter. He is well, and thinks he shall get<br/>through the cold season better than we feared. He sends all sorts<br/>of loving wishes for Christmas, and an especial message to you<br/>girls," said Mrs. March, patting her pocket as if she had got a<br/>treasure there.<br/><br/>"Hurry and get done! Don't stop to quirk your little finger and<br/>simper over your plate, Amy," cried Jo, choking on her tea and<br/>dropping her bread, butter side down, on the carpet in her haste to<br/>get at the treat.<br/>
