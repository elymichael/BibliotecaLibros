Lazy Laurence


Laurie went to Nice intending to stay a week, and remained a
month. He was tired of wandering about alone, and Amy's familiar
presence seemed to give a homelike charm to the foreign scenes in
which she bore a part. He rather missed the 'petting' he used to
receive, and enjoyed a taste of it again, for no attentions,
however flattering, from strangers, were half so pleasant as the
sisterly adoration of the girls at home. Amy never would pet him
like the others, but she was very glad to see him now, and quite
clung to him, feeling that he was the representative of the dear
family for whom she longed more than she would confess. They
naturally took comfort in each other's society and were much
together, riding, walking, dancing, or dawdling, for at Nice no one
can be very industrious during the gay season. But, while
apparently amusing themselves in the most careless fashion, they
were half-consciously making discoveries and forming opinions about
each other. Amy rose daily in the estimation of her friend, but he
sank in hers, and each felt the truth before a word was spoken. Amy
tried to please, and succeeded, for she was grateful for the many
pleasures he gave her, and repaid him with the little services to
which womanly women know how to lend an indescribable charm. Laurie
made no effort of any kind, but just let himself drift along as
comfortably as possible, trying to forget, and feeling that all
women owed him a kind word because one had been cold to him. It
cost him no effort to be generous, and he would have given Amy all
the trinkets in Nice if she would have taken them, but at the same
time he felt that he could not change the opinion she was forming
of him, and he rather dreaded the keen blue eyes that seemed to
watch him with such half-sorrowful, half-scornful surprise.

"All the rest have gone to Monaco for the day. I preferred to
stay at home and write letters. They are done now, and I am going
to Valrosa to sketch, will you come?" said Amy, as she joined
Laurie one lovely day when he lounged in as usual, about noon.

"Well, yes, but isn't it rather warm for such a long walk?" he
answered slowly, for the shaded salon looked inviting after the
glare without.

"I'm going to have the little carriage, and Baptiste can drive,
so you'll have nothing to do but hold your umbrella, and keep your
gloves nice," returned Amy, with a sarcastic glance at the
immaculate kids, which were a weak point with Laurie.

"Then I'll go with pleasure." and he put out his hand for her
sketchbook. But she tucked it under her arm with a sharpâ€¦

"Don't trouble yourself. It's no exertion to me, but you don't
look equal to it."

Laurie lifted his eyebrows and followed at a leisurely pace as
she ran downstairs, but when they got into the carriage he took the
reins himself, and left little Baptiste nothing to do but fold his
arms and fall asleep on his perch.
