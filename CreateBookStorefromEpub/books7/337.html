', and played it as he never did before.<br/><br/>"That's very fine, I dare say, but it's sad enough to make one<br/>cry. Give us something gayer, lad," said Mr. Laurence, whose kind<br/>old heart was full of sympathy, which he longed to show but knew<br/>not how.<br/><br/>Laurie dashed into a livelier strain, played stormily for<br/>several minutes, and would have got through bravely, if in a<br/>momentary lull Mrs. March's voice had not been heard calling, "Jo,<br/>dear, come in. I want you."<br/><br/>Just what Laurie longed to say, with a different meaning! As he<br/>listened, he lost his place, the music ended with a broken chord,<br/>and the musician sat silent in the dark.<br/><br/>"I can't stand this," muttered the old gentleman. Up he got,<br/>groped his way to the piano, laid a kind hand on either of the<br/>broad shoulders, and said, as gently as a woman, "I know, my boy, I<br/>know."<br/><br/>No answer for an instant, then Laurie asked sharply, "Who told<br/>you?"<br/><br/>"Jo herself."<br/><br/>"Then there's an end of it!" And he shook off his grandfather's<br/>hands with an impatient motion, for though grateful for the<br/>sympathy, his man's pride could not bear a man's pity.<br/><br/>"Not quite. I want to say one thing, and then there shall be an<br/>end of it," returned Mr. Laurence with unusual mildness. "You won't<br/>care to stay at home now, perhaps?"<br/><br/>"I don't intend to run away from a girl. Jo can't prevent my<br/>seeing her, and I shall stay and do it as long as I like,"<br/>interrupted Laurie in a defiant tone.<br/><br/>"Not if you are the gentleman I think you. I'm disappointed, but<br/>the girl can't help it, and the only thing left for you to do is to<br/>go away for a time. Where will you go?"<br/>
