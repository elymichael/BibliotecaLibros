<br/>"Is this what made you so unhappy in the autumn, Beth? You did<br/>not feel it then, and keep it to yourself so long, did you?" asked<br/>Jo, refusing to see or say that it was best, but glad to know that<br/>Laurie had no part in Beth's trouble.<br/><br/>"Yes, I gave up hoping then, but I didn't like to own it. I<br/>tried to think it was a sick fancy, and would not let it trouble<br/>anyone. But when I saw you all so well and strong and full of happy<br/>plans, it was hard to feel that I could never be like you, and then<br/>I was miserable, Jo."<br/><br/>"Oh, Beth, and you didn't tell me, didn't let me comfort and<br/>help you? How could you shut me out, bear it all alone?"<br/><br/>Jo's voice was full of tender reproach, and her heart ached to<br/>think of the solitary struggle that must have gone on while Beth<br/>learned to say goodbye to health, love, and life, and take up her<br/>cross so cheerfully.<br/><br/>"Perhaps it was wrong, but I tried to do right. I wasn't sure,<br/>no one said anything, and I hoped I was mistaken. It would have<br/>been selfish to frighten you all when Marmee was so anxious about<br/>Meg, and Amy away, and you so happy with Laurieâ€”at least I thought<br/>so then."<br/><br/>"And I thought you loved him, Beth, and I went away because I<br/>couldn't," cried Jo, glad to say all the truth.<br/><br/>Beth looked so amazed at the idea that Jo smiled in spite of her<br/>pain, and added softly, "Then you didn't, dearie? I was afraid it<br/>was so, and imagined your poor little heart full of lovelornity all<br/>that while."<br/><br/>"Why, Jo, how could I, when he was so fond of you?" asked Beth,<br/>as innocently as a child. "I do love him dearly. He is so good to<br/>me, how can I help It? But he could never be anything to me but my<br/>brother. I hope he truly will be, sometime."<br/><br/>"Not through me," said Jo decidedly. "Amy is left for him, and<br/>they would suit excellently, but I have no heart for such things,<br/>now. I don't care what becomes of anybody but you, Beth. You must<br/>get well."<br/><br/>"I want to, oh, so much! I try, but every day I lose a little,<br/>and feel more sure that I shall never gain it back. It's like the<br/>tide, Jo, when it turns, it goes slowly, but it can't be<br/>stopped."<br/><br/>
