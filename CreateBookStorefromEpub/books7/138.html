<br/>"My sister Beth is a very fastidious girl, when she likes to<br/>be," said Amy, well pleased at Beth's success. She meant<br/>'facinating', but as Grace didn't know the exact meaning of either<br/>word, fastidious sounded well and made a good impression.<br/><br/>An impromptu circus, fox and geese, and an amicable game of<br/>croquet finished the afternoon. At sunset the tent was struck,<br/>hampers packed, wickets pulled up, boats loaded, and the whole<br/>party floated down the river, singing at the tops of their voices.<br/>Ned, getting sentimental, warbled a serenade with the pensive<br/>refrain…<br/><br/><br/>Alone, alone, ah! Woe, alone,<br/><br/><br/>and at the lines…<br/><br/><br/>We each are young, we each have a heart,<br/>Oh, why should we stand thus coldly apart?<br/><br/><br/>he looked at Meg with such a lackadiasical<br/>expression that she laughed outright and spoiled his song.<br/><br/>"How can you be so cruel to me?" he whispered, under cover of a<br/>lively chorus. "You've kept close to that starched-up Englishwoman<br/>all day, and now you snub me."<br/><br/>"I didn't mean to, but you looked so funny I really couldn't<br/>help it," replied Meg, passing over the first part of his reproach,<br/>for it was quite true that she had shunned him, remembering the<br/>Moffat party and the talk after it.<br/>
