"I observed that Amy took drumsticks at dinner, ran errands for
her mother all the afternoon, gave Meg her place tonight, and has
waited on every one with patience and good humor. I also observe
that she does not fret much nor look in the glass, and has not even
mentioned a very pretty ring which she wears, so I conclude that
she has learned to think of other people more and of herself less,
and has decided to try and mold her character as carefully as she
molds her little clay figures. I am glad of this, for though I
should be very proud of a graceful statue made by her, I shall be
infinitely prouder of a lovable daughter with a talent for making
life beautiful to herself and others."

"What are you thinking of, Beth?" asked Jo, when Amy had thanked
her father and told about her ring.

"I read in&#160;
Pilgrim's Progress
&#160;today how,
after many troubles, Christian and Hopeful came to a pleasant green
meadow where lilies bloomed all year round, and there they rested
happily, as we do now, before they went on to their journey's end,"
answered Beth, adding, as she slipped out of her father's arms and
went to the instrument, "It's singing time now, and I want to be in
my old place. I'll try to sing the song of the shepherd boy which
the Pilgrims heard. I made the music for Father, because he likes
the verses."

So, sitting at the dear little piano, Beth softly touched the
keys, and in the sweet voice they had never thought to hear again,
sang to her own accompaniment the quaint hymn, which was a
singularly fitting song for her.


He that is down need fear no fall,
He that is low no pride.
He that is humble ever shall
Have God to be his guide.

I am content with what I have,
Little be it, or much.
And, Lord! Contentment still I crave,
Because Thou savest such.
