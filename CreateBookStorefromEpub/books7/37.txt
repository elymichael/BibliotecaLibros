Burdens


"Oh, dear, how hard it does seem to take up our packs and go
on," sighed Meg the morning after the party, for now the holidays
were over, the week of merrymaking did not fit her for going on
easily with the task she never liked.

"I wish it was Christmas or New Year's all the time. Wouldn't it
be fun?" answered Jo, yawning dismally.

"We shouldn't enjoy ourselves half so much as we do now. But it
does seem so nice to have little suppers and bouquets, and go to
parties, and drive home, and read and rest, and not work. It's like
other people, you know, and I always envy girls who do such things,
I'm so fond of luxury," said Meg, trying to decide which of two
shabby gowns was the least shabby.

"Well, we can't have it, so don't let us grumble but shoulder
our bundles and trudge along as cheerfully as Marmee does. I'm sure
Aunt March is a regular Old Man of the Sea to me, but I suppose
when I've learned to carry her without complaining, she will tumble
off, or get so light that I shan't mind her."

This idea tickled Jo's fancy and put her in good spirits, but
Meg didn't brighten, for her burden, consisting of four spoiled
children, seemed heavier than ever. She had not heart enough even
to make herself pretty as usual by putting on a blue neck ribbon
and dressing her hair in the most becoming way.

"Where's the use of looking nice, when no one sees me but those
cross midgets, and no one cares whether I'm pretty or not?" she
muttered, shutting her drawer with a jerk. "I shall have to toil
and moil all my days, with only little bits of fun now and then,
and get old and ugly and sour, because I'm poor and can't enjoy my
life as other girls do. It's a shame!"

So Meg went down, wearing an injured look, and wasn't at all
agreeable at breakfast time. Everyone seemed rather out of sorts
and inclined to croak.
