<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>6<br/>Calls<br/><br/><br/>"Come, Jo, it's time."<br/><br/>"For what?"<br/><br/>"You don't mean to say you have forgotten that you promised to<br/>make half a dozen calls with me today?"<br/><br/>"I've done a good many rash and foolish things in my life, but I<br/>don't think I ever was mad enough to say I'd make six calls in one<br/>day, when a single one upsets me for a week."<br/><br/>"Yes, you did, it was a bargain between us. I was to finish the<br/>crayon of Beth for you, and you were to go properly with me, and<br/>return our neighbors' visits."<br/><br/>"If it was fair, that was in the bond, and I stand to the letter<br/>of my bond, Shylock. There is a pile of clouds in the east, it's<br/>not fair, and I don't go."<br/><br/>"Now, that's shirking. It's a lovely day, no prospect of rain,<br/>and you pride yourself on keeping promises, so be honorable, come<br/>and do your duty, and then be at peace for another six months."<br/>
