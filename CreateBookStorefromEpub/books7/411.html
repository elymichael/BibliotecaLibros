"And so you shall, like an angel as you are!" cried Laurie,<br/>resolving, with a glow of philanthropic zeal, to found and endow an<br/>institution for the express benefit of young women with artistic<br/>tendencies. "Rich people have no right to sit down and enjoy<br/>themselves, or let their money accumulate for others to waste. It's<br/>not half so sensible to leave legacies when one dies as it is to<br/>use the money wisely while alive, and enjoy making one's fellow<br/>creatures happy with it. We'll have a good time ourselves, and add<br/>an extra relish to our own pleasure by giving other people a<br/>generous taste. Will you be a little Dorcas, going about emptying a<br/>big basket of comforts, and filling it up with good deeds?"<br/><br/>"With all my heart, if you will be a brave St. Martin, stopping<br/>as you ride gallantly through the world to share your cloak with<br/>the beggar."<br/><br/>"It's a bargain, and we shall get the best of it!"<br/><br/>So the young pair shook hands upon it, and then paced happily on<br/>again, feeling that their pleasant home was more homelike because<br/>they hoped to brighten other homes, believing that their own feet<br/>would walk more uprightly along the flowery path before them, if<br/>they smoothed rough ways for other feet, and feeling that their<br/>hearts were more closely knit together by a love which could<br/>tenderly remember those less blest than they.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
