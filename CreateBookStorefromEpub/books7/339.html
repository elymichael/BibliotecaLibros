"Well, sir, what is it?" and Laurie sat down, without a sign of<br/>interest in face or voice.<br/><br/>"There is business in London that needs looking after. I meant<br/>you should attend to it, but I can do it better myself, and things<br/>here will get on very well with Brooke to manage them. My partners<br/>do almost everything, I'm merely holding on until you take my<br/>place, and can be off at any time."<br/><br/>"But you hate traveling, Sir. I can't ask it of you at your<br/>age," began Laurie, who was grateful for the sacrifice, but much<br/>preferred to go alone, if he went at all.<br/><br/>The old gentleman knew that perfectly well, and particularly<br/>desired to prevent it, for the mood in which he found his grandson<br/>assured him that it would not be wise to leave him to his own<br/>devices. So, stifling a natural regret at the thought of the home<br/>comforts he would leave behind him, he said stoutly, "Bless your<br/>soul, I'm not superannuated yet. I quite enjoy the idea. It will do<br/>me good, and my old bones won't suffer, for traveling nowadays is<br/>almost as easy as sitting in a chair."<br/><br/>A restless movement from Laurie suggested that his chair was not<br/>easy, or that he did not like the plan, and made the old man add<br/>hastily, "I don't mean to be a marplot or a burden. I go because I<br/>think you'd feel happier than if I was left behind. I don't intend<br/>to gad about with you, but leave you free to go where you like,<br/>while I amuse myself in my own way. I've friends in London and<br/>Paris, and should like to visit them. Meantime you can go to Italy,<br/>Germany, Switzerland, where you will, and enjoy pictures, music,<br/>scenery, and adventures to your heart's content."<br/><br/>Now, Laurie felt just then that his heart was entirely broken<br/>and the world a howling wilderness, but at the sound of certain<br/>words which the old gentleman artfully introduced into his closing<br/>sentence, the broken heart gave an unexpected leap, and a green<br/>oasis or two suddenly appeared in the howling wilderness. He<br/>sighed, and then said, in a spiritless tone, "Just as you like,<br/>Sir. It doesn't matter where I go or what I do."<br/><br/>"It does to me, remember that, my lad. I give you entire<br/>liberty, but I trust you to make an honest use of it. Promise me<br/>that, Laurie."<br/><br/>"Anything you like, Sir."<br/><br/>"Good," thought the old gentleman. "You don't care now, but<br/>there'll come a time when that promise will keep you out of<br/>mischief, or I'm much mistaken."<br/><br/>Being an energetic individual, Mr. Laurence struck while the<br/>iron was hot, and before the blighted being recovered spirit enough<br/>to rebel, they were off. During the time necessary for preparation,<br/>Laurie bore himself as young gentleman usually do in such cases. He<br/>was moody, irritable, and pensive by turns, lost his appetite,<br/>neglected his dress and devoted much time to playing tempestuously<br/>on his piano, avoided Jo, but consoled himself by staring at her<br/>from his window, with a tragic face that haunted her dreams by<br/>night and oppressed her with a heavy sense of guilt by day. Unlike<br/>some sufferers, he never spoke of his unrequited passion, and would<br/>allow no one, not even Mrs. March, to attempt consolation or offer<br/>sympathy. On some accounts, this was a relief to his friends, but<br/>the weeks before his departure were very uncomfortable, and<br/>everyone rejoiced that the 'poor, dear fellow was going away to<br/>forget his trouble, and come home happy'. Of course, he smiled<br/>darkly at their delusion, but passed it by with the sad superiority<br/>of one who knew that his fidelity like his love was<br/>unalterable.<br/><br/>When the parting came he affected high spirits, to conceal<br/>certain inconvenient emotions which seemed inclined to assert<br/>themselves. This gaiety did not impose upon anybody, but they tried<br/>to look as if it did for his sake, and he got on very well till<br/>Mrs. March kissed him, with a whisper full of motherly solicitude.<br/>Then feeling that he was going very fast, he hastily embraced them<br/>all round, not forgetting the afflicted Hannah, and ran downstairs<br/>as if for his life. Jo followed a minute after to wave her hand to<br/>him if he looked round. He did look round, came back, put his arms<br/>about her as she stood on the step above him, and looked up at her<br/>with a face that made his short appeal eloquent and pathetic.<br/>
