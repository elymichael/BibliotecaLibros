London

Dearest People, Here I really sit at a front
window of the Bath Hotel, Piccadilly. It's not a fashionable place,
but Uncle stopped here years ago, and won't go anywhere else.
However, we don't mean to stay long, so it's no great matter. Oh, I
can't begin to tell you how I enjoy it all! I never can, so I'll
only give you bits out of my notebook, for I've done nothing but
sketch and scribble since I started.

I sent a line from Halifax, when I felt pretty
miserable, but after that I got on delightfully, seldom ill, on
deck all day, with plenty of pleasant people to amuse me. Everyone
was very kind to me, especially the officers. Don't laugh, Jo,
gentlemen really are very necessary aboard ship, to hold on to, or
to wait upon one, and as they have nothing to do, it's a mercy to
make them useful, otherwise they would smoke themselves to death,
I'm afraid.

Aunt and Flo were poorly all the way, and liked
to be let alone, so when I had done what I could for them, I went
and enjoyed myself. Such walks on deck, such sunsets, such splendid
air and waves! It was almost as exciting as riding a fast horse,
when we went rushing on so grandly. I wish Beth could have come, it
would have done her so much good. As for Jo, she would have gone up
and sat on the maintop jib, or whatever the high thing is called,
made friends with the engineers, and tooted on the captain's
speaking trumpet, she'd have been in such a state of rapture.

It was all heavenly, but I was glad to see the
Irish coast, and found it very lovely, so green and sunny, with
brown cabins here and there, ruins on some of the hills, and
gentlemen's countryseats in the valleys, with deer feeding in the
parks. It was early in the morning, but I didn't regret getting up
to see it, for the bay was full of little boats, the shore so
picturesque, and a rosy sky overhead. I never shall forget it.

At Queenstown one of my new acquaintances left
us, Mr. Lennox, and when I said something about the Lakes of
Killarney, he sighed, and sung, with a look at meâ€¦
