<br/>I laughed all the way downstairs, but it was a<br/>little pathetic, also to think of the poor man having to mend his<br/>own clothes. The German gentlemen embroider, I know, but darning<br/>hose is another thing and not so pretty.<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/>Saturday<br/><br/>Nothing has happened to write about, except a<br/>call on Miss Norton, who has a room full of pretty things, and who<br/>was very charming, for she showed me all her treasures, and asked<br/>me if I would sometimes go with her to lectures and concerts, as<br/>her escort, if I enjoyed them. She put it as a favor, but I'm sure<br/>Mrs. Kirke has told her about us, and she does it out of kindness<br/>to me. I'm as proud as Lucifer, but such favors from such people<br/>don't burden me, and I accepted gratefully.<br/><br/>When I got back to the nursery there was such an<br/>uproar in the parlor that I looked in, and there was Mr. Bhaer down<br/>on his hands and knees, with Tina on his back, Kitty leading him<br/>with a jump rope, and Minnie feeding two small boys with seedcakes,<br/>as they roared and ramped in cages built of chairs.<br/><br/>"We are playing nargerie," explained Kitty.<br/><br/>"Dis is mine effalunt!" added Tina, holding on by<br/>the Professor's hair.<br/><br/>"Mamma always allows us to do what we like<br/>Saturday afternoon, when Franz and Emil come, doesn't she, Mr.<br/>Bhaer?" said Minnie.<br/><br/>The 'effalunt' sat up, looking as much in earnest<br/>as any of them, and said soberly to me, "I gif you my wort it is<br/>so, if we make too large a noise you shall say Hush! to us, and we<br/>go more softly."<br/><br/>I promised to do so, but left the door open and<br/>enjoyed the fun as much as they did, for a more glorious frolic I<br/>never witnessed. They played tag and soldiers, danced and sang, and<br/>when it began to grow dark they all piled onto the sofa about the<br/>Professor, while he told charming fairy stories of the storks on<br/>the chimney tops, and the little 'koblods', who ride the snowflakes<br/>as they fall. I wish Americans were as simple and natural as<br/>Germans, don't you?<br/><br/>
