<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>1<br/>Playing Pilgrims<br/><br/><br/>"Christmas won't be Christmas without any presents," grumbled<br/>Jo, lying on the rug.<br/><br/>"It's so dreadful to be poor!" sighed Meg, looking down at her<br/>old dress.<br/><br/>"I don't think it's fair for some girls to have plenty of pretty<br/>things, and other girls nothing at all," added little Amy, with an<br/>injured sniff.<br/><br/>"We've got Father and Mother, and each other," said Beth<br/>contentedly from her corner.<br/><br/>The four young faces on which the firelight shone brightened at<br/>the cheerful words, but darkened again as Jo said sadly, "We<br/>haven't got Father, and shall not have him for a long time." She<br/>didn't say "perhaps never," but each silently added it, thinking of<br/>Father far away, where the fighting was.<br/><br/>Nobody spoke for a minute; then Meg said in an altered tone,<br/>"You know the reason Mother proposed not having any presents this<br/>Christmas was because it is going to be a hard winter for everyone;<br/>and she thinks we ought not to spend money for pleasure, when our<br/>men are suffering so in the army. We can't do much, but we can make<br/>our little sacrifices, and ought to do it gladly. But I am afraid I<br/>don't," and Meg shook her head, as she thought regretfully of all<br/>the pretty things she wanted.<br/><br/>"But I don't think the little we should spend would do any good.<br/>We've each got a dollar, and the army wouldn't be much helped by<br/>our giving that. I agree not to expect anything from Mother or you,<br/>but I do want to buy&#160;<br/>
