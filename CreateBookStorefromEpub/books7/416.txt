"And what did you there?"

"I kissed her," began Demi, with artless frankness.

"Prut! Thou beginnest early. What did the little Mary say to
that?" asked Mr. Bhaer, continuing to confess the young sinner, who
stood upon the knee, exploring the waistcoat pocket.

"Oh, she liked it, and she kissed me, and I liked it. Don't
little boys like little girls?" asked Demi, with his mouth full,
and an air of bland satisfaction.

"You precocious chick! Who put that into your head?" said Jo,
enjoying the innocent revelation as much as the Professor.

"'Tisn't in mine head, it's in mine mouf," answered literal
Demi, putting out his tongue, with a chocolate drop on it, thinking
she alluded to confectionery, not ideas.

"Thou shouldst save some for the little friend. Sweets to the
sweet, mannling," and Mr. Bhaer offered Jo some, with a look that
made her wonder if chocolate was not the nectar drunk by the gods.
Demi also saw the smile, was impressed by it, and artlessy
inquiredâ€¦

"Do great boys like great girls, to, 'Fessor?"

Like young Washington, Mr. Bhaer 'couldn't tell a lie', so he
gave the somewhat vague reply that he believed they did sometimes,
in a tone that made Mr. March put down his clothesbrush, glance at
Jo's retiring face, and then sink into his chair, looking as if the
'precocious chick' had put an idea into his head that was both
sweet and sour.

Why Dodo, when she caught him in the china closet half an hour
afterward, nearly squeezed the breath out of his little body with a
tender embrace, instead of shaking him for being there, and why she
followed up this novel performance by the unexpected gift of a big
slice of bread and jelly, remained one of the problems over which
Demi puzzled his small wits, and was forced to leave unsolved
forever.
