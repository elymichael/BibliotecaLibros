<br/>"I'm not! And if turning up my hair makes me one, I'll wear it<br/>in two tails till I'm twenty," cried Jo, pulling off her net, and<br/>shaking down a chestnut mane. "I hate to think I've got to grow up,<br/>and be Miss March, and wear long gowns, and look as prim as a China<br/>Aster! It's bad enough to be a girl, anyway, when I like boy's<br/>games and work and manners! I can't get over my disappointment in<br/>not being a boy. And it's worse than ever now, for I'm dying to go<br/>and fight with Papa. And I can only stay home and knit, like a poky<br/>old woman!"<br/><br/>And Jo shook the blue army sock till the needles rattled like<br/>castanets, and her ball bounded across the room.<br/><br/>"Poor Jo! It's too bad, but it can't be helped. So you must try<br/>to be contented with making your name boyish, and playing brother<br/>to us girls," said Beth, stroking the rough head with a hand that<br/>all the dish washing and dusting in the world could not make<br/>ungentle in its touch.<br/><br/>"As for you, Amy," continued Meg, "you are altogether too<br/>particular and prim. Your airs are funny now, but you'll grow up an<br/>affected little goose, if you don't take care. I like your nice<br/>manners and refined ways of speaking, when you don't try to be<br/>elegant. But your absurd words are as bad as Jo's slang."<br/><br/>"If Jo is a tomboy and Amy a goose, what am I, please?" asked<br/>Beth, ready to share the lecture.<br/><br/>"You're a dear, and nothing else," answered Meg warmly, and no<br/>one contradicted her, for the 'Mouse' was the pet of the<br/>family.<br/><br/>As young readers like to know 'how people look', we will take<br/>this moment to give them a little sketch of the four sisters, who<br/>sat knitting away in the twilight, while the December snow fell<br/>quietly without, and the fire crackled cheerfully within. It was a<br/>comfortable room, though the carpet was faded and the furniture<br/>very plain, for a good picture or two hung on the walls, books<br/>filled the recesses, chrysanthemums and Christmas roses bloomed in<br/>the windows, and a pleasant atmosphere of home peace pervaded<br/>it.<br/><br/>Margaret, the eldest of the four, was sixteen, and very pretty,<br/>being plump and fair, with large eyes, plenty of soft brown hair, a<br/>sweet mouth, and white hands, of which she was rather vain.<br/>Fifteen-year-old Jo was very tall, thin, and brown, and reminded<br/>one of a colt, for she never seemed to know what to do with her<br/>long limbs, which were very much in her way. She had a decided<br/>mouth, a comical nose, and sharp, gray eyes, which appeared to see<br/>everything, and were by turns fierce, funny, or thoughtful. Her<br/>long, thick hair was her one beauty, but it was usually bundled<br/>into a net, to be out of her way. Round shoulders had Jo, big hands<br/>and feet, a flyaway look to her clothes, and the uncomfortable<br/>appearance of a girl who was rapidly shooting up into a woman and<br/>didn't like it. Elizabeth, or Beth, as everyone called her, was a<br/>rosy, smooth-haired, bright-eyed girl of thirteen, with a shy<br/>manner, a timid voice, and a peaceful expression which was seldom<br/>disturbed. Her father called her 'Little Miss Tranquility', and the<br/>name suited her excellently, for she seemed to live in a happy<br/>world of her own, only venturing out to meet the few whom she<br/>trusted and loved. Amy, though the youngest, was a most important<br/>person, in her own opinion at least. A regular snow maiden, with<br/>blue eyes, and yellow hair curling on her shoulders, pale and<br/>slender, and always carrying herself like a young lady mindful of<br/>her manners. What the characters of the four sisters were we will<br/>leave to be found out.<br/><br/>The clock struck six and, having swept up the hearth, Beth put a<br/>pair of slippers down to warm. Somehow the sight of the old shoes<br/>had a good effect upon the girls, for Mother was coming, and<br/>everyone brightened to welcome her. Meg stopped lecturing, and<br/>lighted the lamp, Amy got out of the easy chair without being<br/>asked, and Jo forgot how tired she was as she sat up to hold the<br/>slippers nearer to the blaze.<br/><br/>"They are quite worn out. Marmee must have a new pair."<br/><br/>
