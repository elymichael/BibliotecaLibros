In spite of various very natural temptations to resent and<br/>retaliate, Amy adhered to her resolution all the next day, bent on<br/>conquering her enemy by kindness. She began well, thanks to a<br/>silent reminder that came to her unexpectedly, but most<br/>opportunely. As she arranged her table that morning, while the<br/>little girls were in the anteroom filling the baskets, she took up<br/>her pet production, a little book, the antique cover of which her<br/>father had found among his treasures, and in which on leaves of<br/>vellum she had beautifully illuminated different texts. As she<br/>turned the pages rich in dainty devices with very pardonable pride,<br/>her eye fell upon one verse that made her stop and think. Framed in<br/>a brilliant scrollwork of scarlet, blue and gold, with little<br/>spirits of good will helping one another up and down among the<br/>thorns and flowers, were the words, "Thou shalt love thy neighbor<br/>as thyself."<br/><br/>"I ought, but I don't," thought Amy, as her eye went from the<br/>bright page to May's discontented face behind the big vases, that<br/>could not hide the vacancies her pretty work had once filled. Amy<br/>stood a minute, turning the leaves in her hand, reading on each<br/>some sweet rebuke for all heartburnings and uncharitableness of<br/>spirit. Many wise and true sermons are preached us every day by<br/>unconscious ministers in street, school, office, or home. Even a<br/>fair table may become a pulpit, if it can offer the good and<br/>helpful words which are never out of season. Amy's conscience<br/>preached her a little sermon from that text, then and there, and<br/>she did what many of us do not always do, took the sermon to heart,<br/>and straightway put it in practice.<br/><br/>A group of girls were standing about May's table, admiring the<br/>pretty things, and talking over the change of saleswomen. They<br/>dropped their voices, but Amy knew they were speaking of her,<br/>hearing one side of the story and judging accordingly. It was not<br/>pleasant, but a better spirit had come over her, and presently a<br/>chance offered for proving it. She heard May say sorrowfully…<br/><br/>"It's too bad, for there is no time to make other things, and I<br/>don't want to fill up with odds and ends. The table was just<br/>complete then. Now it's spoiled."<br/><br/>"I dare say she'd put them back if you asked her," suggested<br/>someone.<br/><br/>"How could I after all the fuss?" began May, but she did not<br/>finish, for Amy's voice came across the hall, saying<br/>pleasantly…<br/><br/>"You may have them, and welcome, without asking, if you want<br/>them. I was just thinking I'd offer to put them back, for they<br/>belong to your table rather than mine. Here they are, please take<br/>them, and forgive me if I was hasty in carrying them away last<br/>night."<br/><br/>As she spoke, Amy returned her contribution, with a nod and a<br/>smile, and hurried away again, feeling that it was easier to do a<br/>friendly thing than it was to stay and be thanked for it.<br/><br/>"Now, I call that lovely of her, don't you?" cried one girl.<br/><br/>May's answer was inaudible, but another young lady, whose temper<br/>was evidently a little soured by making lemonade, added, with a<br/>disagreeable laugh, "Very lovely, for she knew she wouldn't sell<br/>them at her own table."<br/><br/>Now, that was hard. When we make little sacrifices we like to<br/>have them appreciated, at least, and for a minute Amy was sorry she<br/>had done it, feeling that virtue was not always its own reward. But<br/>it is, as she presently discovered, for her spirits began to rise,<br/>and her table to blossom under her skillful hands, the girls were<br/>very kind, and that one little act seemed to have cleared the<br/>atmosphere amazingly.<br/>
