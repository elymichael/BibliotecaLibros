"Not a bit, and you never will. You've grown bigger and bonnier,
but you are the same scapegrace as ever."

"Now really, Jo, you ought to treat me with more respect," began
Laurie, who enjoyed it all immensely.

"How can I, when the mere idea of you, married and settled, is
so irresistibly funny that I can't keep sober!" answered Jo,
smiling all over her face, so infectiously that they had another
laugh, and then settled down for a good talk, quite in the pleasant

"It's no use your going out in the cold to get Amy, for they are

nonsense, and wouldn't let Amy come with us. So I just settled the

like'."

"Of course you did. You always have things to suit you."

"Not always," and something in Laurie's voice made Jo say
