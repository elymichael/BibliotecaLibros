<br/>"It's no harm, Jo. I have billiards at home, but it's no fun<br/>unless you have good players, so, as I'm fond of it, I come<br/>sometimes and have a game with Ned Moffat or some of the other<br/>fellows."<br/><br/>"Oh, dear, I'm so sorry, for you'll get to liking it better and<br/>better, and will waste time and money, and grow like those dreadful<br/>boys. I did hope you'd stay respectable and be a satisfaction to<br/>your friends," said Jo, shaking her head.<br/><br/>"Can't a fellow take a little innocent amusement now and then<br/>without losing his respectability?" asked Laurie, looking<br/>nettled.<br/><br/>"That depends upon how and where he takes it. I don't like Ned<br/>and his set, and wish you'd keep out of it. Mother won't let us<br/>have him at our house, though he wants to come. And if you grow<br/>like him she won't be willing to have us frolic together as we do<br/>now."<br/><br/>"Won't she?" asked Laurie anxiously.<br/><br/>"No, she can't bear fashionable young men, and she'd shut us all<br/>up in bandboxes rather than have us associate with them."<br/><br/>"Well, she needn't get out her bandboxes yet. I'm not a<br/>fashionable party and don't mean to be, but I do like harmless<br/>larks now and then, don't you?"<br/><br/>"Yes, nobody minds them, so lark away, but don't get wild, will<br/>you? Or there will be an end of all our good times."<br/><br/>"I'll be a double distilled saint."<br/><br/>"I can't bear saints. Just be a simple, honest, respectable boy,<br/>and we'll never desert you. I don't know what I should do if you<br/>acted like Mr. King's son. He had plenty of money, but didn't know<br/>how to spend it, and got tipsy and gambled, and ran away, and<br/>forged his father's name, I believe, and was altogether<br/>horrid."<br/><br/>
