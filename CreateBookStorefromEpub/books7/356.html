"Let me show you. Did John ever neglect you, as you call it,<br/>while you made it a point to give him your society of an evening,<br/>his only leisure time?"<br/><br/>"No, but I can't do it now, with two babies to tend."<br/><br/>"I think you could, dear, and I think you ought. May I speak<br/>quite freely, and will you remember that it's Mother who blames as<br/>well as Mother who sympathizes?"<br/><br/>"Indeed I will! Speak to me as if I were little Meg again. I<br/>often feel as if I needed teaching more than ever since these<br/>babies look to me for everything."<br/><br/>Meg drew her low chair beside her mother's, and with a little<br/>interruption in either lap, the two women rocked and talked<br/>lovingly together, feeling that the tie of motherhood made them<br/>more one than ever.<br/><br/>"You have only made the mistake that most young wives<br/>makeâ€”forgotten your duty to your husband in your love for your<br/>children. A very natural and forgivable mistake, Meg, but one that<br/>had better be remedied before you take to different ways, for<br/>children should draw you nearer than ever, not separate you, as if<br/>they were all yours, and John had nothing to do but support them.<br/>I've seen it for some weeks, but have not spoken, feeling sure it<br/>would come right in time."<br/><br/>"I'm afraid it won't. If I ask him to stay, he'll think I'm<br/>jealous, and I wouldn't insult him by such an idea. He doesn't see<br/>that I want him, and I don't know how to tell him without<br/>words."<br/><br/>"Make it so pleasant he won't want to go away. My dear, he's<br/>longing for his little home, but it isn't home without you, and you<br/>are always in the nursery."<br/><br/>"Oughtn't I to be there?"<br/><br/>"Not all the time, too much confinement makes you nervous, and<br/>then you are unfitted for everything. Besides, you owe something to<br/>John as well as to the babies. Don't neglect husband for children,<br/>don't shut him out of the nursery, but teach him how to help in it.<br/>His place is there as well as yours, and the children need him. Let<br/>him feel that he has a part to do, and he will do it gladly and<br/>faithfully, and it will be better for you all."<br/><br/>"You really think so, Mother?"<br/>
