"Mercy on us. What dreadful thing will you do next?" and Jo fell
into her seat with a gasp.

"A characteristic, but not exactly complimentary,
congratulation," returned Laurie, still in an abject attitude, but
beaming with satisfaction.

"What can you expect, when you take one's breath away, creeping
in like a burglar, and letting cats out of bags like that? Get up,
you ridiculous boy, and tell me all about it."

"Not a word, unless you let me come in my old place, and promise
not to barricade."

Jo laughed at that as she had not done for many a long day, and
patted the sofa invitingly, as she said in a cordial tone, "The old
pillow is up garret, and we don't need it now. So, come and 'fess,
Teddy."

"How good it sounds to hear you say 'Teddy'! No one ever calls
me that but you," and Laurie sat down with an air of great
content.

"What does Amy call you?"

"My lord."

"That's like her. Well, you look it," and Jo's eye plainly
betrayed that she found her boy comelier than ever.

The pillow was gone, but there was a barricade, nevertheless, a
natural one, raised by time, absence, and change of heart. Both
felt it, and for a minute looked at one another as if that
invisible barrier cast a little shadow over them. It was gone
directly however, for Laurie said, with a vain attempt at
dignityâ€¦

"Don't I look like a married man and the head of a family?"
