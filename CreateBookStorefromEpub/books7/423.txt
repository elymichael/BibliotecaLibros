"Miss Marsch, I haf a great favor to ask of you," began the
Professor, after a moist promenade of half a block.

"Yes, sir?" and Jo's heart began to beat so hard she was afraid
he would hear it.

"I am bold to say it in spite of the rain, because so short a
time remains to me."

"Yes, sir," and Jo nearly crushed the small flowerpot with the
sudden squeeze she gave it.

"I wish to get a little dress for my Tina, and I am too stupid
to go alone. Will you kindly gif me a word of taste and help?"

"Yes, sir," and Jo felt as calm and cool all of a sudden as if
she had stepped into a refrigerator.

"Perhaps also a shawl for Tina's mother, she is so poor and
sick, and the husband is such a care. Yes, yes, a thick, warm shawl
would be a friendly thing to take the little mother."

"I'll do it with pleasure, Mr. Bhaer." "I'm going very fast, and
he's getting dearer every minute," added Jo to herself, then with a
mental shake she entered into the business with an energy that was
pleasant to behold.

Mr. Bhaer left it all to her, so she chose a pretty gown for
Tina, and then ordered out the shawls. The clerk, being a married
man, condescended to take an interest in the couple, who appeared
to be shopping for their family.

"Your lady may prefer this. It's a superior article, a most
desirable color, quite chaste and genteel," he said, shaking out a
comfortable gray shawl, and throwing it over Jo's shoulders.
