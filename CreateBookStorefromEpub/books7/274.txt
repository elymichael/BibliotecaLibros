"Boy and girl. Aren't they beauties?" said the proud papa,
beaming upon the little red squirmers as if they were unfledged
angels.

"Most remarkable children I ever saw. Which is which?" and
Laurie bent like a well-sweep to examine the prodigies.

"Amy put a blue ribbon on the boy and a pink on the girl, French
fashion, so you can always tell. Besides, one has blue eyes and one
brown. Kiss them, Uncle Teddy," said wicked Jo.

"I'm afraid they mightn't like it," began Laurie, with unusual
timidity in such matters.

"Of course they will, they are used to it now. Do it this
minute, sir!" commanded Jo, fearing he might propose a proxy.

Laurie screwed up his face and obeyed with a gingerly peck at
each little cheek that produced another laugh, and made the babies
squeal.

"There, I knew they didn't like it! That's the boy, see him
kick, he hits out with his fists like a good one. Now then, young
Brooke, pitch into a man of your own size, will you?" cried Laurie,
delighted with a poke in the face from a tiny fist, flapping
aimlessly about.

"He's to be named John Laurence, and the girl Margaret, after
mother and grandmother. We shall call her Daisey, so as not to have
two Megs, and I suppose the mannie will be Jack, unless we find a
better name," said Amy, with aunt-like interest.

"Name him Demijohn, and call him Demi for short," said
Laurie

"Daisy and Demi, just the thing! I knew Teddy would do it,"
cried Jo clapping her hands.

Teddy certainly had done it that time, for the babies were
'Daisy' and 'Demi' to the end of the chapter.
