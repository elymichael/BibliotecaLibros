Mr. Bhaer spoke warmly, and walked to the fire, crumpling the<br/>paper in his hands. Jo sat still, looking as if the fire had come<br/>to her, for her cheeks burned long after the cocked hat had turned<br/>to smoke and gone harmlessly up the chimney.<br/><br/>"I should like much to send all the rest after him," muttered<br/>the Professor, coming back with a relieved air.<br/><br/>Jo thought what a blaze her pile of papers upstairs would make,<br/>and her hard-earned money lay rather heavily on her conscience at<br/>that minute. Then she thought consolingly to herself, "Mine are not<br/>like that, they are only silly, never bad, so I won't be worried,"<br/>and taking up her book, she said, with a studious face, "Shall we<br/>go on, Sir? I'll be very good and proper now."<br/><br/>"I shall hope so," was all he said, but he meant more than she<br/>imagined, and the grave, kind look he gave her made her feel as if<br/>the words Weekly Volcano were printed in large type on her<br/>forehead.<br/><br/>As soon as she went to her room, she got out her papers, and<br/>carefully reread every one of her stories. Being a little<br/>shortsighted, Mr. Bhaer sometimes used eye glasses, and Jo had<br/>tried them once, smiling to see how they magnified the fine print<br/>of her book. Now she seemed to have on the Professor's mental or<br/>moral spectacles also, for the faults of these poor stories glared<br/>at her dreadfully and filled her with dismay.<br/><br/>"They are trash, and will soon be worse trash if I go on, for<br/>each is more sensational than the last. I've gone blindly on,<br/>hurting myself and other people, for the sake of money. I know it's<br/>so, for I can't read this stuff in sober earnest without being<br/>horribly ashamed of it, and what should I do if they were seen at<br/>home or Mr. Bhaer got hold of them?"<br/><br/>Jo turned hot at the bare idea, and stuffed the whole bundle<br/>into her stove, nearly setting the chimney afire with the<br/>blaze.<br/><br/>"Yes, that's the best place for such inflammable nonsense. I'd<br/>better burn the house down, I suppose, than let other people blow<br/>themselves up with my gunpowder," she thought as she watched the<br/>Demon of the Jura whisk away, a little black cinder with fiery<br/>eyes.<br/><br/>But when nothing remained of all her three month's work except a<br/>heap of ashes and the money in her lap, Jo looked sober, as she sat<br/>on the floor, wondering what she ought to do about her wages.<br/><br/>"I think I haven't done much harm yet, and may keep this to pay<br/>for my time," she said, after a long meditation, adding<br/>impatiently, "I almost wish I hadn't any conscience, it's so<br/>inconvenient. If I didn't care about doing right, and didn't feel<br/>uncomfortable when doing wrong, I should get on capitally. I can't<br/>help wishing sometimes, that Mother and Father hadn't been so<br/>particular about such things."<br/><br/>Ah, Jo, instead of wishing that, thank God that 'Father and<br/>Mother were particular', and pity from your heart those who have no<br/>such guardians to hedge them round with principles which may seem<br/>like prison walls to impatient youth, but which will prove sure<br/>foundations to build character upon in womanhood.<br/>
