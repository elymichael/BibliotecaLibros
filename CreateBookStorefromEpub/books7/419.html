<br/>"You'd better take the little umbrella, dear. It looks like<br/>rain," said her mother, observing that she had on her new bonnet,<br/>but not alluding to the fact.<br/><br/>"Yes, Marmee, do you want anything in town? I've got to run in<br/>and get some paper," returned Jo, pulling out the bow under her<br/>chin before the glass as an excuse for not looking at her<br/>mother.<br/><br/>"Yes, I want some twilled silesia, a paper of number nine<br/>needles, and two yards of narrow lavender ribbon. Have you got your<br/>thick boots on, and something warm under your cloak?"<br/><br/>"I believe so," answered Jo absently.<br/><br/>"If you happen to meet Mr. Bhaer, bring him home to tea. I quite<br/>long to see the dear man," added Mrs. March.<br/><br/>Jo heard that, but made no answer, except to kiss her mother,<br/>and walk rapidly away, thinking with a glow of gratitude, in spite<br/>of her heartache, "How good she is to me! What do girls do who<br/>haven't any mothers to help them through their troubles?"<br/><br/>The dry-goods stores were not down among the counting-houses,<br/>banks, and wholesale warerooms, where gentlemen most do congregate,<br/>but Jo found herself in that part of the city before she did a<br/>single errand, loitering along as if waiting for someone, examining<br/>engineering instruments in one window and samples of wool in<br/>another, with most unfeminine interest, tumbling over barrels,<br/>being half-smothered by descending bales, and hustled<br/>unceremoniously by busy men who looked as if they wondered 'how the<br/>deuce she got there'. A drop of rain on her cheek recalled her<br/>thoughts from baffled hopes to ruined ribbons. For the drops<br/>continued to fall, and being a woman as well as a lover, she felt<br/>that, though it was too late to save her heart, she might her<br/>bonnet. Now she remembered the little umbrella, which she had<br/>forgotten to take in her hurry to be off, but regret was<br/>unavailing, and nothing could be done but borrow one or submit to a<br/>drenching. She looked up at the lowering sky, down at the crimson<br/>bow already flecked with black, forward along the muddy street,<br/>then one long, lingering look behind, at a certain grimy warehouse,<br/>with 'Hoffmann, Swartz, &amp; Co.' over the door, and said to<br/>herself, with a sternly reproachful airâ€¦<br/><br/>"It serves me right! what business had I to put on all my best<br/>things and come philandering down here, hoping to see the<br/>Professor? Jo, I'm ashamed of you! No, you shall not go there to<br/>borrow an umbrella, or find out where he is, from his friends. You<br/>shall trudge away, and do your errands in the rain, and if you<br/>catch your death and ruin your bonnet, it's no more than you<br/>deserve. Now then!"<br/><br/>With that she rushed across the street so impetuously that she<br/>narrowly escaped annihilation from a passing truck, and<br/>precipitated herself into the arms of a stately old gentleman, who<br/>said, "I beg pardon, ma'am," and looked mortally offended. Somewhat<br/>daunted, Jo righted herself, spread her handkerchief over the<br/>devoted ribbons, and putting temptation behind her, hurried on,<br/>with increasing dampness about the ankles, and much clashing of<br/>umbrellas overhead. The fact that a somewhat dilapidated blue one<br/>remained stationary above the unprotected bonnet attracted her<br/>attention, and looking up, she saw Mr. Bhaer looking down.<br/><br/>"I feel to know the strong-minded lady who goes so bravely under<br/>many horse noses, and so fast through much mud. What do you down<br/>here, my friend?"<br/><br/>
