If the boy had replied like Alcibiades, "By the gods, Socrates,<br/>I cannot tell," his grandfather would not have been surprised, but<br/>when, after standing a moment on one leg, like a meditative young<br/>stork, he answered, in a tone of calm conviction, "In my little<br/>belly," the old gentleman could only join in Grandma's laugh, and<br/>dismiss the class in metaphysics.<br/><br/>There might have been cause for maternal anxiety, if Demi had<br/>not given convincing proofs that he was a true boy, as well as a<br/>budding philosopher, for often, after a discussion which caused<br/>Hannah to prophesy, with ominous nods, "That child ain't long for<br/>this world," he would turn about and set her fears at rest by some<br/>of the pranks with which dear, dirty, naughty little rascals<br/>distract and delight their parent's souls.<br/><br/>Meg made many moral rules, and tried to keep them, but what<br/>mother was ever proof against the winning wiles, the ingenious<br/>evasions, or the tranquil audacity of the miniature men and women<br/>who so early show themselves accomplished Artful Dodgers?<br/><br/>"No more raisins, Demi. They'll make you sick," says Mamma to<br/>the young person who offers his services in the kitchen with<br/>unfailing regularity on plum-pudding day.<br/><br/>"Me likes to be sick."<br/><br/>"I don't want to have you, so run away and help Daisy make patty<br/>cakes."<br/><br/>He reluctantly departs, but his wrongs weigh upon his spirit,<br/>and by-and-by when an opportunity comes to redress them, he outwits<br/>Mamma by a shrewd bargain.<br/><br/>"Now you have been good children, and I'll play anything you<br/>like," says Meg, as she leads her assistant cooks upstairs, when<br/>the pudding is safely bouncing in the pot.<br/><br/>"Truly, Marmar?" asks Demi, with a brilliant idea in his<br/>well-powdered head.<br/><br/>"Yes, truly. Anything you say," replies the shortsighted parent,<br/>preparing herself to sing, "The Three Little Kittens" half a dozen<br/>times over, or to take her family to "Buy a penny bun," regardless<br/>of wind or limb. But Demi corners her by the cool replyâ€¦<br/><br/>"Then we'll go and eat up all the raisins."<br/>
