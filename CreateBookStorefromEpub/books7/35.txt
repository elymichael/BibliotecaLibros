"I always go early, I do, truly! Please let me take you home.
It's all on my way, you know, and it rains, they say."

That settled it, and telling him of Meg's mishap, Jo gratefully
accepted and rushed up to bring down the rest of the party. Hannah
hated rain as much as a cat does so she made no trouble, and they
rolled away in the luxurious close carriage, feeling very festive
and elegant. Laurie went on the box so Meg could keep her foot up,
and the girls talked over their party in freedom.

"I had a capital time. Did you?" asked Jo, rumpling up her hair,
and making herself comfortable.

"Yes, till I hurt myself. Sallie's friend, Annie Moffat, took a
fancy to me, and asked me to come and spend a week with her when
Sallie does. She is going in the spring when the opera comes, and
it will be perfectly splendid, if Mother only lets me go," answered
Meg, cheering up at the thought.

"I saw you dancing with the red headed man I ran away from. Was
he nice?"

"Oh, very! His hair is auburn, not red, and he was very polite,
and I had a delicious redowa with him."

"He looked like a grasshopper in a fit when he did the new step.
Laurie and I couldn't help laughing. Did you hear us?"

"No, but it was very rude. What were you about all that time,
hidden away there?"

Jo told her adventures, and by the time she had finished they
were at home. With many thanks, they said good night and crept in,
hoping to disturb no one, but the instant their door creaked, two
little nightcaps bobbed up, and two sleepy but eager voices cried
outâ€¦

"Tell about the party! Tell about the party!"
