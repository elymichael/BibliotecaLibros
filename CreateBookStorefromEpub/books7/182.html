"Christopher Columbus! What's the matter?" cried Jo, as Beth put<br/>out her hand as if to warn her off, and asked quicklyâ€¦<br/><br/>"You've had the scarlet fever, haven't you?"<br/><br/>"Years ago, when Meg did. Why?"<br/><br/>"Then I'll tell you. Oh, Jo, the baby's dead!"<br/><br/>"What baby?"<br/><br/>"Mrs. Hummel's. It died in my lap before she got home," cried<br/>Beth with a sob.<br/><br/>"My poor dear, how dreadful for you! I ought to have gone," said<br/>Jo, taking her sister in her arms as she sat down in her mother's<br/>big chair, with a remorseful face.<br/><br/>"It wasn't dreadful, Jo, only so sad! I saw in a minute it was<br/>sicker, but Lottchen said her mother had gone for a doctor, so I<br/>took Baby and let Lotty rest. It seemed asleep, but all of a sudden<br/>if gave a little cry and trembled, and then lay very still. I tried<br/>to warm its feet, and Lotty gave it some milk, but it didn't stir,<br/>and I knew it was dead."<br/><br/>"Don't cry, dear! What did you do?"<br/><br/>"I just sat and held it softly till Mrs. Hummel came with the<br/>doctor. He said it was dead, and looked at Heinrich and Minna, who<br/>have sore throats. 'Scarlet fever, ma'am. Ought to have called me<br/>before,' he said crossly. Mrs. Hummel told him she was poor, and<br/>had tried to cure baby herself, but now it was too late, and she<br/>could only ask him to help the others and trust to charity for his<br/>pay. He smiled then, and was kinder, but it was very sad, and I<br/>cried with them till he turned round all of a sudden, and told me<br/>to go home and take belladonna right away, or I'd have the<br/>fever."<br/><br/>"No, you won't!" cried Jo, hugging her close, with a frightened<br/>look. "Oh, Beth, if you should be sick I never could forgive<br/>myself! What shall we do?"<br/>
