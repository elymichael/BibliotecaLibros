"It's no harm, Jo. I have billiards at home, but it's no fun
unless you have good players, so, as I'm fond of it, I come
sometimes and have a game with Ned Moffat or some of the other
fellows."

"Oh, dear, I'm so sorry, for you'll get to liking it better and
better, and will waste time and money, and grow like those dreadful
boys. I did hope you'd stay respectable and be a satisfaction to
your friends," said Jo, shaking her head.

"Can't a fellow take a little innocent amusement now and then
without losing his respectability?" asked Laurie, looking
nettled.

"That depends upon how and where he takes it. I don't like Ned
and his set, and wish you'd keep out of it. Mother won't let us
have him at our house, though he wants to come. And if you grow
like him she won't be willing to have us frolic together as we do
now."

"Won't she?" asked Laurie anxiously.

"No, she can't bear fashionable young men, and she'd shut us all
up in bandboxes rather than have us associate with them."

"Well, she needn't get out her bandboxes yet. I'm not a
fashionable party and don't mean to be, but I do like harmless
larks now and then, don't you?"

"Yes, nobody minds them, so lark away, but don't get wild, will
you? Or there will be an end of all our good times."

"I'll be a double distilled saint."

"I can't bear saints. Just be a simple, honest, respectable boy,
and we'll never desert you. I don't know what I should do if you
acted like Mr. King's son. He had plenty of money, but didn't know
how to spend it, and got tipsy and gambled, and ran away, and
forged his father's name, I believe, and was altogether
horrid."
