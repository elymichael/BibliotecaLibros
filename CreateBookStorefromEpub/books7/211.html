<br/>"He writes in a different way entirely, telling me that he never<br/>sent any love letter at all, and is very sorry that my roguish<br/>sister, Jo, should take liberties with our names. It's very kind<br/>and respectful, but think how dreadful for me!"<br/><br/>Meg leaned against her mother, looking the image of despair, and<br/>Jo tramped about the room, calling Laurie names. All of a sudden<br/>she stopped, caught up the two notes, and after looking at them<br/>closely, said decidedly, "I don't believe Brooke ever saw either of<br/>these letters. Teddy wrote both, and keeps yours to crow over me<br/>with because I wouldn't tell him my secret."<br/><br/>"Don't have any secrets, Jo. Tell it to Mother and keep out of<br/>trouble, as I should have done," said Meg warningly.<br/><br/>"Bless you, child! Mother told me."<br/><br/>"That will do, Jo. I'll comfort Meg while you go and get Laurie.<br/>I shall sift the matter to the bottom, and put a stop to such<br/>pranks at once."<br/><br/>Away ran Jo, and Mrs. March gently told Meg Mr. Brooke's real<br/>feelings. "Now, dear, what are your own? Do you love him enough to<br/>wait till he can make a home for you, or will you keep yourself<br/>quite free for the present?"<br/><br/>"I've been so scared and worried, I don't want to have anything<br/>to do with lovers for a long while, perhaps never," answered Meg<br/>petulantly. "If John doesn't know anything about this nonsense,<br/>don't tell him, and make Jo and Laurie hold their tongues. I won't<br/>be deceived and plagued and made a fool of. It's a shame!"<br/><br/>Seeing Meg's usually gentle temper was roused and her pride hurt<br/>by this mischievous joke, Mrs. March soothed her by promises of<br/>entire silence and great discretion for the future. The instant<br/>Laurie's step was heard in the hall, Meg fled into the study, and<br/>Mrs. March received the culprit alone. Jo had not told him why he<br/>was wanted, fearing he wouldn't come, but he knew the minute he saw<br/>Mrs. March's face, and stood twirling his hat with a guilty air<br/>which convicted him at once. Jo was dismissed, but chose to march<br/>up and down the hall like a sentinel, having some fear that the<br/>prisoner might bolt. The sound of voices in the parlor rose and<br/>fell for half an hour, but what happened during that interview the<br/>girls never knew.<br/><br/>When they were called in, Laurie was standing by their mother<br/>with such a penitent face that Jo forgave him on the spot, but did<br/>not think it wise to betray the fact. Meg received his humble<br/>apology, and was much comforted by the assurance that Brooke knew<br/>nothing of the joke.<br/><br/>"I'll never tell him to my dying day, wild horses shan't drag it<br/>out of me, so you'll forgive me, Meg, and I'll do anything to show<br/>how out-and-out sorry I am," he added, looking very much ashamed of<br/>himself.<br/><br/>
