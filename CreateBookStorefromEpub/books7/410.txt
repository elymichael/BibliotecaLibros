"Oh, that's the trouble is it? I thought there was something in
the dimple that didn't quite suit you. Not being a dog in the
manger, but the happiest fellow alive, I assure you I can dance at
Jo's wedding with a heart as light as my heels. Do you doubt it, my
darling?"

Amy looked up at him, and was satisfied. Her little jealous fear
vanished forever, and she thanked him, with a face full of love and
confidence.

"I wish we could do something for that capital old Professor.
Couldn't we invent a rich relation, who shall obligingly die out
there in Germany, and leave him a tidy little fortune?" said
Laurie, when they began to pace up and down the long drawing room,
arm in arm, as they were fond of doing, in memory of the chateau
garden.

"Jo would find us out, and spoil it all. She is very proud of
him, just as he is, and said yesterday that she thought poverty was
a beautiful thing."

"Bless her dear heart! She won't think so when she has a
literary husband, and a dozen little professors and professorins to
support. We won't interfere now, but watch our chance, and do them
a good turn in spite of themselves. I owe Jo for a part of my
education, and she believes in people's paying their honest debts,
so I'll get round her in that way."

"How delightful it is to be able to help others, isn't it? That
was always one of my dreams, to have the power of giving freely,
and thanks to you, the dream has come true."

"Ah, we'll do quantities of good, won't we? There's one sort of
poverty that I particularly like to help. Out-and-out beggars get
taken care of, but poor gentle folks fare badly, because they won't
ask, and people don't dare to offer charity. Yet there are a
thousand ways of helping them, if one only knows how to do it so
delicately that it does not offend. I must say, I like to serve a
decayed gentleman better than a blarnerying beggar. I suppose it's
wrong, but I do, though it is harder."

"Because it takes a gentleman to do it," added the other member
of the domestic admiration society.

"Thank you, I'm afraid I don't deserve that pretty compliment.
But I was going to say that while I was dawdling about abroad, I
saw a good many talented young fellows making all sorts of
sacrifices, and enduring real hardships, that they might realize
their dreams. Splendid fellows, some of them, working like heros,
poor and friendless, but so full of courage, patience, and ambition
that I was ashamed of myself, and longed to give them a right good
lift. Those are people whom it's a satisfaction to help, for if
they've got genius, it's an honor to be allowed to serve them, and
not let it be lost or delayed for want of fuel to keep the pot
boiling. If they haven't, it's a pleasure to comfort the poor
souls, and keep them from despair when they find it out."

"Yes, indeed, and there's another class who can't ask, and who
suffer in silence. I know something of it, for I belonged to it
before you made a princess of me, as the king does the beggarmaid
in the old story. Ambitious girls have a hard time, Laurie, and
often have to see youth, health, and precious opportunities go by,
just for want of a little help at the right minute. People have
been very kind to me, and whenever I see girls struggling along, as
we used to do, I want to put out my hand and help them, as I was
helped."
