"I don't know. I'm afraid not, for I didn't have any heart just
then."

"Prut! That I do not believe. It was asleep till the fairy
prince came through the wood, and waked it up. Ah, well, 'Die erste
Liebe ist die beste', but that I should not expect."

"Yes, the first love is the best, but be so contented, for I
never had another. Teddy was only a boy, and soon got over his
little fancy," said Jo, anxious to correct the Professor's
mistake.

"Good! Then I shall rest happy, and be sure that thou givest me
all. I haf waited so long, I am grown selfish, as thou wilt find,
Professorin."

"I like that," cried Jo, delighted with her new name. "Now tell
me what brought you, at last, just when I wanted you?"

"This," and Mr. Bhaer took a little worn paper out of his
waistcoat pocket.

Jo unfolded it, and looked much abashed, for it was one of her
own contributions to a paper that paid for poetry, which accounted
for her sending it an occasional attempt.

"How could that bring you?" she asked, wondering what he
meant.

"I found it by chance. I knew it by the names and the initials,
and in it there was one little verse that seemed to call me. Read
and find him. I will see that you go not in the wet."
