"Stop, Jo, you must clear yourself first. You have played so<br/>many pranks that I am afraid you have had a hand in this."<br/><br/>"On my word, Mother, I haven't! I never saw that note before,<br/>and don't know anything about it, as true as I live!" said Jo, so<br/>earnestly that they believed her. "If I had taken part in it I'd<br/>have done it better than this, and have written a sensible note. I<br/>should think you'd have known Mr. Brooke wouldn't write such stuff<br/>as that," she added, scornfully tossing down the paper.<br/><br/>"It's like his writing," faltered Meg, comparing it with the<br/>note in her hand.<br/><br/>"Oh, Meg, you didn't answer it?" cried Mrs. March quickly.<br/><br/>"Yes, I did!" and Meg hid her face again, overcome with<br/>shame.<br/><br/>"Here's a scrape! Do let me bring that wicked boy over to<br/>explain and be lectured. I can't rest till I get hold of him." And<br/>Jo made for the door again.<br/><br/>"Hush! Let me handle this, for it is worse than I thought.<br/>Margaret, tell me the whole story," commanded Mrs. March, sitting<br/>down by Meg, yet keeping hold of Jo, lest she should fly off.<br/><br/>"I received the first letter from Laurie, who didn't look as if<br/>he knew anything about it," began Meg, without looking up. "I was<br/>worried at first and meant to tell you, then I remembered how you<br/>liked Mr. Brooke, so I thought you wouldn't mind if I kept my<br/>little secret for a few days. I'm so silly that I liked to think no<br/>one knew, and while I was deciding what to say, I felt like the<br/>girls in books, who have such things to do. Forgive me, Mother, I'm<br/>paid for my silliness now. I never can look him in the face<br/>again."<br/><br/>"What did you say to him?" asked Mrs. March.<br/><br/>"I only said I was too young to do anything about it yet, that I<br/>didn't wish to have secrets from you, and he must speak to father.<br/>I was very grateful for his kindness, and would be his friend, but<br/>nothing more, for a long while."<br/><br/>Mrs. March smiled, as if well pleased, and Jo clapped her hands,<br/>exclaiming, with a laugh, "You are almost equal to Caroline Percy,<br/>who was a pattern of prudence! Tell on, Meg. What did he say to<br/>that?"<br/>
