<br/>"Good for you, Jo! Did you do it on your own responsibility?"<br/>asked Laurie, as he seated her in the hall chair and took off the<br/>rebellious boots, seeing how her hands shook.<br/><br/>"No. The doctor told us to."<br/><br/>"Oh, Jo, it's not so bad as that?" cried Laurie, with a startled<br/>face.<br/><br/>"Yes, it is. She doesn't know us, she doesn't even talk about<br/>the flocks of green doves, as she calls the vine leaves on the<br/>wall. She doesn't look like my Beth, and there's nobody to help us<br/>bear it. Mother and father both gone, and God seems so far away I<br/>can't find Him."<br/><br/>As the tears streamed fast down poor Jo's cheeks, she stretched<br/>out her hand in a helpless sort of way, as if groping in the dark,<br/>and Laurie took it in his, whispering as well as he could with a<br/>lump in his throat, "I'm here. Hold on to me, Jo, dear!"<br/><br/>She could not speak, but she did 'hold on', and the warm grasp<br/>of the friendly human hand comforted her sore heart, and seemed to<br/>lead her nearer to the Divine arm which alone could uphold her in<br/>her trouble.<br/><br/>Laurie longed to say something tender and comfortable, but no<br/>fitting words came to him, so he stood silent, gently stroking her<br/>bent head as her mother used to do. It was the best thing he could<br/>have done, far more soothing than the most eloquent words, for Jo<br/>felt the unspoken sympathy, and in the silence learned the sweet<br/>solace which affection administers to sorrow. Soon she dried the<br/>tears which had relieved her, and looked up with a grateful<br/>face.<br/><br/>"Thank you, Teddy, I'm better now. I don't feel so forlorn, and<br/>will try to bear it if it comes."<br/><br/>"Keep hoping for the best, that will help you, Jo. Soon your<br/>mother will be here, and then everything will be all right."<br/><br/>"I'm so glad Father is better. Now she won't feel so bad about<br/>leaving him. Oh, me! It does seem as if all the troubles came in a<br/>heap, and I got the heaviest part on my shoulders," sighed Jo,<br/>spreading her wet handkerchief over her knees to dry.<br/><br/>
