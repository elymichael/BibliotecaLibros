<br/>Here lies Pip March,<br/>Who died the 7th of June;<br/>Loved and lamented sore,<br/>And not forgotten soon.<br/><br/><br/>At the conclusion of the ceremonies, Beth retired to her room,<br/>overcome with emotion and lobster, but there was no place of<br/>repose, for the beds were not made, and she found her grief much<br/>assuaged by beating up the pillows and putting things in order. Meg<br/>helped Jo clear away the remains of the feast, which took half the<br/>afternoon and left them so tired that they agreed to be contented<br/>with tea and toast for supper.<br/><br/>Laurie took Amy to drive, which was a deed of charity, for the<br/>sour cream seemed to have had a bad effect upon her temper. Mrs.<br/>March came home to find the three older girls hard at work in the<br/>middle of the afternoon, and a glance at the closet gave her an<br/>idea of the success of one part of the experiment.<br/><br/>Before the housewives could rest, several people called, and<br/>there was a scramble to get ready to see them. Then tea must be<br/>got, errands done, and one or two necessary bits of sewing<br/>neglected until the last minute. As twilight fell, dewy and still,<br/>one by one they gathered on the porch where the June roses were<br/>budding beautifully, and each groaned or sighed as she sat down, as<br/>if tired or troubled.<br/><br/>"What a dreadful day this has been!" began Jo, usually the first<br/>to speak.<br/><br/>"It has seemed shorter than usual, but so uncomfortable," said<br/>Meg.<br/><br/>"Not a bit like home," added Amy.<br/><br/>"It can't seem so without Marmee and little Pip," sighed Beth,<br/>glancing with full eyes at the empty cage above her head.<br/><br/>
