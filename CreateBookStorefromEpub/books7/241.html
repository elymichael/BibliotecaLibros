<br/>Meg had spent the time in working as well as waiting, growing<br/>womanly in character, wise in housewifely arts, and prettier than<br/>ever, for love is a great beautifier. She had her girlish ambitions<br/>and hopes, and felt some disappointment at the humble way in which<br/>the new life must begin. Ned Moffat had just married Sallie<br/>Gardiner, and Meg couldn't help contrasting their fine house and<br/>carriage, many gifts, and splendid outfit with her own, and<br/>secretly wishing she could have the same. But somehow envy and<br/>discontent soon vanished when she thought of all the patient love<br/>and labor John had put into the little home awaiting her, and when<br/>they sat together in the twilight, talking over their small plans,<br/>the future always grew so beautiful and bright that she forgot<br/>Sallie's splendor and felt herself the richest, happiest girl in<br/>Christendom.<br/><br/>Jo never went back to Aunt March, for the old lady took such a<br/>fancy to Amy that she bribed her with the offer of drawing lessons<br/>from one of the best teachers going, and for the sake of this<br/>advantage, Amy would have served a far harder mistress. So she gave<br/>her mornings to duty, her afternoons to pleasure, and prospered<br/>finely. Jo meantime devoted herself to literature and Beth, who<br/>remained delicate long after the fever was a thing of the past. Not<br/>an invalid exactly, but never again the rosy, healthy creature she<br/>had been, yet always hopeful, happy, and serene, and busy with the<br/>quiet duties she loved, everyone's friend, and an angel in the<br/>house, long before those who loved her most had learned to know<br/>it.<br/><br/>As long as&#160;<br/>The Spread Eagle<br/>&#160;paid her a dollar<br/>a column for her 'rubbish', as she called it, Jo felt herself a<br/>woman of means, and spun her little romances diligently. But great<br/>plans fermented in her busy brain and ambitious mind, and the old<br/>tin kitchen in the garret held a slowly increasing pile of blotted<br/>manuscript, which was one day to place the name of March upon the<br/>roll of fame.<br/><br/>Laurie, having dutifully gone to college to please his<br/>grandfather, was now getting through it in the easiest possible<br/>manner to please himself. A universal favorite, thanks to money,<br/>manners, much talent, and the kindest heart that ever got its owner<br/>into scrapes by trying to get other people out of them, he stood in<br/>great danger of being spoiled, and probably would have been, like<br/>many another promising boy, if he had not possessed a talisman<br/>against evil in the memory of the kind old man who was bound up in<br/>his success, the motherly friend who watched over him as if he were<br/>her son, and last, but not least by any means, the knowledge that<br/>four innocent girls loved, admired, and believed in him with all<br/>their hearts.<br/><br/>Being only 'a glorious human boy', of course he frolicked and<br/>flirted, grew dandified, aquatic, sentimental, or gymnastic, as<br/>college fashions ordained, hazed and was hazed, talked slang, and<br/>more than once came perilously near suspension and expulsion. But<br/>as high spirits and the love of fun were the causes of these<br/>pranks, he always managed to save himself by frank confession,<br/>honorable atonement, or the irresistible power of persuasion which<br/>he possessed in perfection. In fact, he rather prided himself on<br/>his narrow escapes, and liked to thrill the girls with graphic<br/>accounts of his triumphs over wrathful tutors, dignified<br/>professors, and vanquished enemies. The 'men of my class', were<br/>heroes in the eyes of the girls, who never wearied of the exploits<br/>of 'our fellows', and were frequently allowed to bask in the smiles<br/>of these great creatures, when Laurie brought them home with<br/>him.<br/><br/>Amy especially enjoyed this high honor, and became quite a belle<br/>among them, for her ladyship early felt and learned to use the gift<br/>of fascination with which she was endowed. Meg was too much<br/>absorbed in her private and particular John to care for any other<br/>lords of creation, and Beth too shy to do more than peep at them<br/>and wonder how Amy dared to order them about so, but Jo felt quite<br/>in her own element, and found it very difficult to refrain from<br/>imitating the gentlemanly attitudes, phrases, and feats, which<br/>seemed more natural to her than the decorums prescribed for young<br/>ladies. They all liked Jo immensely, but never fell in love with<br/>her, though very few escaped without paying the tribute of a<br/>sentimental sigh or two at Amy's shrine. And speaking of sentiment<br/>brings us very naturally to the 'Dovecote'.<br/><br/>That was the name of the little brown house Mr. Brooke had<br/>prepared for Meg's first home. Laurie had christened it, saying it<br/>was highly appropriate to the gentle lovers who 'went on together<br/>like a pair of turtledoves, with first a bill and then a coo'. It<br/>was a tiny house, with a little garden behind and a lawn about as<br/>big as a pocket handkerchief in the front. Here Meg meant to have a<br/>fountain, shrubbery, and a profusion of lovely flowers, though just<br/>at present the fountain was represented by a weather-beaten urn,<br/>very like a dilapidated slopbowl, the shrubbery consisted of<br/>several young larches, undecided whether to live or die, and the<br/>profusion of flowers was merely hinted by regiments of sticks to<br/>show where seeds were planted. But inside, it was altogether<br/>charming, and the happy bride saw no fault from garret to cellar.<br/>To be sure, the hall was so narrow it was fortunate that they had<br/>no piano, for one never could have been got in whole, the dining<br/>room was so small that six people were a tight fit, and the kitchen<br/>stairs seemed built for the express purpose of precipitating both<br/>servants and china pell-mell into the coalbin. But once get used to<br/>these slight blemishes and nothing could be more complete, for good<br/>sense and good taste had presided over the furnishing, and the<br/>result was highly satisfactory. There were no marble-topped tables,<br/>long mirrors, or lace curtains in the little parlor, but simple<br/>furniture, plenty of books, a fine picture or two, a stand of<br/>flowers in the bay window, and, scattered all about, the pretty<br/>gifts which came from friendly hands and were the fairer for the<br/>loving messages they brought.<br/><br/>I don't think the Parian Psyche Laurie gave lost any of its<br/>beauty because John put up the bracket it stood upon, that any<br/>upholsterer could have draped the plain muslin curtains more<br/>gracefully than Amy's artistic hand, or that any store-room was<br/>ever better provided with good wishes, merry words, and happy hopes<br/>than that in which Jo and her mother put away Meg's few boxes,<br/>barrels, and bundles, and I am morally certain that the spandy new<br/>kitchen never could have looked so cozy and neat if Hannah had not<br/>arranged every pot and pan a dozen times over, and laid the fire<br/>all ready for lighting the minute 'Mis. Brooke came home'. I also<br/>doubt if any young matron ever began life with so rich a supply of<br/>dusters, holders, and piece bags, for Beth made enough to last till<br/>the silver wedding came round, and invented three different kinds<br/>of dishcloths for the express service of the bridal china.<br/><br/>People who hire all these things done for them never know what<br/>they lose, for the homeliest tasks get beautified if loving hands<br/>do them, and Meg found so many proofs of this that everything in<br/>her small nest, from the kitchen roller to the silver vase on her<br/>parlor table, was eloquent of home love and tender forethought.<br/><br/>
