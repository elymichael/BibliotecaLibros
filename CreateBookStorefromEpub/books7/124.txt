"I like to please Laurie, and I'm not afraid of Mr. Brooke, he
is so kind. But I don't want to play, or sing, or say anything.
I'll work hard and not trouble anyone, and you'll take care of me,
Jo, so I'll go."

"That's my good girl. You do try to fight off your shyness, and
I love you for it. Fighting faults isn't easy, as I know, and a
cheery word kind of gives a lift. Thank you, Mother," And Jo gave
the thin cheek a grateful kiss, more precious to Mrs. March than if
it had given back the rosy roundness of her youth.

"I had a box of chocolate drops, and the picture I wanted to
copy," said Amy, showing her mail.

"And I got a note from Mr. Laurence, asking me to come over and
play to him tonight, before the lamps are lighted, and I shall go,"
added Beth, whose friendship with the old gentleman prospered
finely.

"Now let's fly round, and do double duty today, so that we can
play tomorrow with free minds," said Jo, preparing to replace her
pen with a broom.

When the sun peeped into the girls' room early next morning to
promise them a fine day, he saw a comical sight. Each had made such
preparation for the fete as seemed necessary and proper. Meg had an
extra row of little curlpapers across her forehead, Jo had
copiously anointed her afflicted face with cold cream, Beth had
taken Joanna to bed with her to atone for the approaching
separation, and Amy had capped the climax by putting a clothespin
on her nose to uplift the offending feature. It was one of the kind
artists use to hold the paper on their drawing boards, therefore
quite appropriate and effective for the purpose it was now being
put. This funny spectacle appeared to amuse the sun, for he burst
out with such radiance that Jo woke up and roused her sisters by a
hearty laugh at Amy's ornament.

Sunshine and laughter were good omens for a pleasure party, and
soon a lively bustle began in both houses. Beth, who was ready
first, kept reporting what went on next door, and enlivened her
sisters' toilets by frequent telegrams from the window.

"There goes the man with the tent! I see Mrs. Barker doing up
the lunch in a hamper and a great basket. Now Mr. Laurence is
looking up at the sky and the weathercock. I wish he would go too.
There's Laurie, looking like a sailor, nice boy! Oh, mercy me!
Here's a carriage full of people, a tall lady, a little girl, and
two dreadful boys. One is lame, poor thing, he's got a crutch.
Laurie didn't tell us that. Be quick, girls! It's getting late.
Why, there is Ned Moffat, I do declare. Meg, isn't that the man who
bowed to you one day when we were shopping?"

"So it is. How queer that he should come. I thought he was at
the mountains. There is Sallie. I'm glad she got back in time. Am I
all right, Jo?" cried Meg in a flutter.

"A regular daisy. Hold up your dress and put your hat on
straight, it looks sentimental tipped that way and will fly off at
the first puff. Now then, come on!"
