"And you expect to live on the produce of the place? Well, that
sounds paradisiacal, but you'll find it desperate hard work."

"The crop we are going to raise is a profitable one," and Jo
laughed.

"Of what is this fine crop to consist, ma'am?"

"Boys. I want to open a school for little lads—a good, happy,
homelike school, with me to take care of them and Fritz to teach
them."

"That's a truly Joian plan for you! Isn't that just like her?"
cried Laurie, appealing to the family, who looked as much surprised
as he.

"I like it," said Mrs. March decidedly.

"So do I," added her husband, who welcomed the thought of a
chance for trying the Socratic method of education on modern
youth.

"It will be an immense care for Jo," said Meg, stroking the head
of her one all-absorbing son.

"Jo can do it, and be happy in it. It's a splendid idea. Tell us
all about it," cried Mr. Laurence, who had been longing to lend the
lovers a hand, but knew that they would refuse his help.

"I knew you'd stand by me, sir. Amy does too—I see it in her
eyes, though she prudently waits to turn it over in her mind before
she speaks. Now, my dear people," continued Jo earnestly, "just
understand that this isn't a new idea of mine, but a long cherished
plan. Before my Fritz came, I used to think how, when I'd made my
fortune, and no one needed me at home, I'd hire a big house, and
pick up some poor, forlorn little lads who hadn't any mothers, and
take care of them, and make life jolly for them before it was too
late. I see so many going to ruin for want of help at the right
minute, I love so to do anything for them, I seem to feel their
wants, and sympathize with their troubles, and oh, I should so like
to be a mother to them!"
