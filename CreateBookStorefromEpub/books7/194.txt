Never had the sun risen so beautifully, and never had the world
seemed so lovely as it did to the heavy eyes of Meg and Jo, as they
looked out in the early morning, when their long, sad vigil was
done.

"It looks like a fairy world," said Meg, smiling to herself, as
she stood behind the curtain, watching the dazzling sight.

"Hark!" cried Jo, starting to her feet.

Yes, there was a sound of bells at the door below, a cry from
Hannah, and then Laurie's voice saying in a joyful whisper, "Girls,
she's come! She's come!"
