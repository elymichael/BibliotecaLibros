"Hold it up when you walk, but drop it in the house. The<br/>sweeping style suits you best, and you must learn to trail your<br/>skirts gracefully. You haven't half buttoned one cuff, do it at<br/>once. You'll never look finished if you are not careful about the<br/>little details, for they make up the pleasing whole."<br/><br/>Jo sighed, and proceeded to burst the buttons off her glove, in<br/>doing up her cuff, but at last both were ready, and sailed away,<br/>looking as 'pretty as picters', Hannah said, as she hung out of the<br/>upper window to watch them.<br/><br/>"Now, Jo dear, the Chesters consider themselves very elegant<br/>people, so I want you to put on your best deportment. Don't make<br/>any of your abrupt remarks, or do anything odd, will you? Just be<br/>calm, cool, and quiet, that's safe and ladylike, and you can easily<br/>do it for fifteen minutes," said Amy, as they approached the first<br/>place, having borrowed the white parasol and been inspected by Meg,<br/>with a baby on each arm.<br/><br/>"Let me see. 'Calm, cool, and quiet', yes, I think I can promise<br/>that. I've played the part of a prim young lady on the stage, and<br/>I'll try it off. My powers are great, as you shall see, so be easy<br/>in your mind, my child."<br/><br/>Amy looked relieved, but naughty Jo took her at her word, for<br/>during the first call she sat with every limb gracefully composed,<br/>every fold correctly draped, calm as a summer sea, cool as a<br/>snowbank, and as silent as the sphinx. In vain Mrs. Chester alluded<br/>to her 'charming novel', and the Misses Chester introduced parties,<br/>picnics, the opera, and the fashions. Each and all were answered by<br/>a smile, a bow, and a demure "Yes" or "No" with the chill on. In<br/>vain Amy telegraphed the word 'talk', tried to draw her out, and<br/>administered covert pokes with her foot. Jo sat as if blandly<br/>unconscious of it all, with deportment like Maud's face, 'icily<br/>regular, splendidly null'.<br/><br/>"What a haughty, uninteresting creature that oldest Miss March<br/>is!" was the unfortunately audible remark of one of the ladies, as<br/>the door closed upon their guests. Jo laughed noiselessly all<br/>through the hall, but Amy looked disgusted at the failure of her<br/>instructions, and very naturally laid the blame upon Jo.<br/><br/>"How could you mistake me so? I merely meant you to be properly<br/>dignified and composed, and you made yourself a perfect stock and<br/>stone. Try to be sociable at the Lambs'. Gossip as other girls do,<br/>and be interested in dress and flirtations and whatever nonsense<br/>comes up. They move in the best society, are valuable persons for<br/>us to know, and I wouldn't fail to make a good impression there for<br/>anything."<br/><br/>"I'll be agreeable. I'll gossip and giggle, and have horrors and<br/>raptures over any trifle you like. I rather enjoy this, and now<br/>I'll imitate what is called 'a charming girl'. I can do it, for I<br/>have May Chester as a model, and I'll improve upon her. See if the<br/>Lambs don't say, 'What a lively, nice creature that Jo March<br/>is!"<br/><br/>Amy felt anxious, as well she might, for when Jo turned freakish<br/>there was no knowing where she would stop. Amy's face was a study<br/>when she saw her sister skim into the next drawing room, kiss all<br/>the young ladies with effusion, beam graciously upon the young<br/>gentlemen, and join in the chat with a spirit which amazed the<br/>beholder. Amy was taken possession of by Mrs. Lamb, with whom she<br/>was a favorite, and forced to hear a long account of Lucretia's<br/>last attack, while three delightful young gentlemen hovered near,<br/>waiting for a pause when they might rush in and rescue her. So<br/>situated, she was powerless to check Jo, who seemed possessed by a<br/>spirit of mischief, and talked away as volubly as the lady. A knot<br/>of heads gathered about her, and Amy strained her ears to hear what<br/>was going on, for broken sentences filled her with curiosity, and<br/>frequent peals of laughter made her wild to share the fun. One may<br/>imagine her suffering on overhearing fragments of this sort of<br/>conversation.<br/><br/>"She rides splendidly. Who taught her?"<br/><br/>"No one. She used to practice mounting, holding the reins, and<br/>sitting straight on an old saddle in a tree. Now she rides<br/>anything, for she doesn't know what fear is, and the stableman lets<br/>her have horses cheap because she trains them to carry ladies so<br/>well. She has such a passion for it, I often tell her if everything<br/>else fails, she can be a horsebreaker, and get her living so."<br/>
