<br/>"It's your little mind, Demi," replied the sage, stroking the<br/>yellow head respectfully.<br/><br/>"What is a little mine?"<br/><br/>"It is something which makes your body move, as the spring made<br/>the wheels go in my watch when I showed it to you."<br/><br/>"Open me. I want to see it go wound."<br/><br/>"I can't do that any more than you could open the watch. God<br/>winds you up, and you go till He stops you."<br/><br/>"Does I?" and Demi's brown eyes grew big and bright as he took<br/>in the new thought. "Is I wounded up like the watch?"<br/><br/>"Yes, but I can't show you how, for it is done when we don't<br/>see."<br/><br/>Demi felt his back, as if expecting to find it like that of the<br/>watch, and then gravely remarked, "I dess Dod does it when I's<br/>asleep."<br/><br/>A careful explanation followed, to which he listened so<br/>attentively that his anxious grandmother said, "My dear, do you<br/>think it wise to talk about such things to that baby? He's getting<br/>great bumps over his eyes, and learning to ask the most<br/>unanswerable questions."<br/><br/>"If he is old enough to ask the question he is old enough to<br/>receive true answers. I am not putting the thoughts into his head,<br/>but helping him unfold those already there. These children are<br/>wiser than we are, and I have no doubt the boy understands every<br/>word I have said to him. Now, Demi, tell me where you keep your<br/>mind."<br/><br/>
