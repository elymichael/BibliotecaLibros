<br/>"How sharp you are, Marmee, and how silent! You never said a<br/>word to me."<br/><br/>"Mothers have need of sharp eyes and discreet tongues when they<br/>have girls to manage. I was half afraid to put the idea into your<br/>head, lest you should write and congratulate them before the thing<br/>was settled."<br/><br/>"I'm not the scatterbrain I was. You may trust me. I'm sober and<br/>sensible enough for anyone's confidante now."<br/><br/>"So you are, my dear, and I should have made you mine, only I<br/>fancied it might pain you to learn that your Teddy loved someone<br/>else."<br/><br/>"Now, Mother, did you really think I could be so silly and<br/>selfish, after I'd refused his love, when it was freshest, if not<br/>best?"<br/><br/>"I knew you were sincere then, Jo, but lately I have thought<br/>that if he came back, and asked again, you might perhaps, feel like<br/>giving another answer. Forgive me, dear, I can't help seeing that<br/>you are very lonely, and sometimes there is a hungry look in your<br/>eyes that goes to my heart. So I fancied that your boy might fill<br/>the empty place if he tried now."<br/><br/>"No, Mother, it is better as it is, and I'm glad Amy has learned<br/>to love him. But you are right in one thing. I am lonely, and<br/>perhaps if Teddy had tried again, I might have said 'Yes', not<br/>because I love him any more, but because I care more to be loved<br/>than when he went away."<br/><br/>"I'm glad of that, Jo, for it shows that you are getting on.<br/>There are plenty to love you, so try to be satisfied with Father<br/>and Mother, sisters and brothers, friends and babies, till the best<br/>lover of all comes to give you your reward."<br/><br/>"Mothers are the best lovers in the world, but I don't mind<br/>whispering to Marmee that I'd like to try all kinds. It's very<br/>curious, but the more I try to satisfy myself with all sorts of<br/>natural affections, the more I seem to want. I'd no idea hearts<br/>could take in so many. Mine is so elastic, it never seems full now,<br/>and I used to be quite contented with my family. I don't understand<br/>it."<br/><br/>"I do," and Mrs. March smiled her wise smile, as Jo turned back<br/>the leaves to read what Amy said of Laurie.<br/><br/>
