Beth had a headache and lay on the sofa, trying to comfort
herself with the cat and three kittens. Amy was fretting because
her lessons were not learned, and she couldn't find her rubbers. Jo
would whistle and make a great racket getting ready.

Mrs. March was very busy trying to finish a letter, which must
go at once, and Hannah had the grumps, for being up late didn't
suit her.

"There never was such a cross family!" cried Jo, losing her
temper when she had upset an inkstand, broken both boot lacings,
and sat down upon her hat.

"You're the crossest person in it!" returned Amy, washing out
the sum that was all wrong with the tears that had fallen on her
slate.

"Beth, if you don't keep these horrid cats down cellar I'll have
them drowned," exclaimed Meg angrily as she tried to get rid of the
kitten which had scrambled up her back and stuck like a burr just
out of reach.

Jo laughed, Meg scolded, Beth implored, and Amy wailed because
she couldn't remember how much nine times twelve was.

"Girls, girls, do be quiet one minute! I must get this off by
the early mail, and you drive me distracted with your worry," cried
Mrs. March, crossing out the third spoiled sentence in her
letter.

There was a momentary lull, broken by Hannah, who stalked in,
laid two hot turnovers on the table, and stalked out again. These
turnovers were an institution, and the girls called them 'muffs',
for they had no others and found the hot pies very comforting to
their hands on cold mornings.

Hannah never forgot to make them, no matter how busy or grumpy
she might be, for the walk was long and bleak. The poor things got
no other lunch and were seldom home before two.

"Cuddle your cats and get over your headache, Bethy. Goodbye,
Marmee. We are a set of rascals this morning, but we'll come home
regular angels. Now then, Meg!" And Jo tramped away, feeling that
the pilgrims were not setting out as they ought to do.
