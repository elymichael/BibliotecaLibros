Beth said nothing, but wiped away her tears with the blue army<br/>sock and began to knit with all her might, losing no time in doing<br/>the duty that lay nearest her, while she resolved in her quiet<br/>little soul to be all that Father hoped to find her when the year<br/>brought round the happy coming home.<br/><br/>Mrs. March broke the silence that followed Jo's words, by saying<br/>in her cheery voice, "Do you remember how you used to play Pilgrims<br/>Progress when you were little things? Nothing delighted you more<br/>than to have me tie my piece bags on your backs for burdens, give<br/>you hats and sticks and rolls of paper, and let you travel through<br/>the house from the cellar, which was the City of Destruction, up,<br/>up, to the housetop, where you had all the lovely things you could<br/>collect to make a Celestial City."<br/><br/>"What fun it was, especially going by the lions, fighting<br/>Apollyon, and passing through the valley where the hob-goblins<br/>were," said Jo.<br/><br/>"I liked the place where the bundles fell off and tumbled<br/>downstairs," said Meg.<br/><br/>"I don't remember much about it, except that I was afraid of the<br/>cellar and the dark entry, and always liked the cake and milk we<br/>had up at the top. If I wasn't too old for such things, I'd rather<br/>like to play it over again," said Amy, who began to talk of<br/>renouncing childish things at the mature age of twelve.<br/><br/>"We never are too old for this, my dear, because it is a play we<br/>are playing all the time in one way or another. Our burdens are<br/>here, our road is before us, and the longing for goodness and<br/>happiness is the guide that leads us through many troubles and<br/>mistakes to the peace which is a true Celestial City. Now, my<br/>little pilgrims, suppose you begin again, not in play, but in<br/>earnest, and see how far on you can get before Father comes<br/>home."<br/><br/>"Really, Mother? Where are our bundles?" asked Amy, who was a<br/>very literal young lady.<br/><br/>"Each of you told what your burden was just now, except Beth. I<br/>rather think she hasn't got any," said her mother.<br/><br/>"Yes, I have. Mine is dishes and dusters, and envying girls with<br/>nice pianos, and being afraid of people."<br/><br/>Beth's bundle was such a funny one that everybody wanted to<br/>laugh, but nobody did, for it would have hurt her feelings very<br/>much.<br/><br/>"Let us do it," said Meg thoughtfully. "It is only another name<br/>for trying to be good, and the story may help us, for though we do<br/>want to be good, it's hard work and we forget, and don't do our<br/>best."<br/>
