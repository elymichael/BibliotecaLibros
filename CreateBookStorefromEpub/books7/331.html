<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>12<br/>Heartache<br/><br/><br/>Whatever his motive might have been, Laurie studied to some<br/>purpose that year, for he graduated with honor, and gave the Latin<br/>oration with the grace of a Phillips and the eloquence of a<br/>Demosthenes, so his friends said. They were all there, his<br/>grandfather—oh, so proud—Mr. and Mrs. March, John and Meg, Jo and<br/>Beth, and all exulted over him with the sincere admiration which<br/>boys make light of at the time, but fail to win from the world by<br/>any after-triumphs.<br/><br/>"I've got to stay for this confounded supper, but I shall be<br/>home early tomorrow. You'll come and meet me as usual, girls?"<br/>Laurie said, as he put the sisters into the carriage after the joys<br/>of the day were over. He said 'girls', but he meant Jo, for she was<br/>the only one who kept up the old custom. She had not the heart to<br/>refuse her splendid, successful boy anything, and answered<br/>warmly…<br/><br/>"I'll come, Teddy, rain or shine, and march before you, playing<br/>'Hail the conquering hero comes' on a jew's-harp."<br/><br/>Laurie thanked her with a look that made her think in a sudden<br/>panic, "Oh, deary me! I know he'll say something, and then what<br/>shall I do?"<br/><br/>Evening meditation and morning work somewhat allayed her fears,<br/>and having decided that she wouldn't be vain enough to think people<br/>were going to propose when she had given them every reason to know<br/>what her answer would be, she set forth at the appointed time,<br/>hoping Teddy wouldn't do anything to make her hurt his poor<br/>feelings. A call at Meg's, and a refreshing sniff and sip at the<br/>Daisy and Demijohn, still further fortified her for the<br/>tete-a-tete, but when she saw a stalwart figure looming in the<br/>distance, she had a strong desire to turn about and run away.<br/><br/>"Where's the jew's-harp, Jo?" cried Laurie, as soon as he was<br/>within speaking distance.<br/><br/>"I forgot it." And Jo took heart again, for that salutation<br/>could not be called lover-like.<br/>
