Mr. Bhaer spoke warmly, and walked to the fire, crumpling the
paper in his hands. Jo sat still, looking as if the fire had come
to her, for her cheeks burned long after the cocked hat had turned
to smoke and gone harmlessly up the chimney.

"I should like much to send all the rest after him," muttered
the Professor, coming back with a relieved air.

Jo thought what a blaze her pile of papers upstairs would make,
and her hard-earned money lay rather heavily on her conscience at
that minute. Then she thought consolingly to herself, "Mine are not
like that, they are only silly, never bad, so I won't be worried,"
and taking up her book, she said, with a studious face, "Shall we
go on, Sir? I'll be very good and proper now."

"I shall hope so," was all he said, but he meant more than she
imagined, and the grave, kind look he gave her made her feel as if
the words Weekly Volcano were printed in large type on her
forehead.

As soon as she went to her room, she got out her papers, and
carefully reread every one of her stories. Being a little
shortsighted, Mr. Bhaer sometimes used eye glasses, and Jo had
tried them once, smiling to see how they magnified the fine print
of her book. Now she seemed to have on the Professor's mental or
moral spectacles also, for the faults of these poor stories glared
at her dreadfully and filled her with dismay.

"They are trash, and will soon be worse trash if I go on, for
each is more sensational than the last. I've gone blindly on,
hurting myself and other people, for the sake of money. I know it's
so, for I can't read this stuff in sober earnest without being
horribly ashamed of it, and what should I do if they were seen at
home or Mr. Bhaer got hold of them?"

Jo turned hot at the bare idea, and stuffed the whole bundle
into her stove, nearly setting the chimney afire with the
blaze.

"Yes, that's the best place for such inflammable nonsense. I'd
better burn the house down, I suppose, than let other people blow
themselves up with my gunpowder," she thought as she watched the
Demon of the Jura whisk away, a little black cinder with fiery
eyes.

But when nothing remained of all her three month's work except a
heap of ashes and the money in her lap, Jo looked sober, as she sat
on the floor, wondering what she ought to do about her wages.

"I think I haven't done much harm yet, and may keep this to pay
for my time," she said, after a long meditation, adding
impatiently, "I almost wish I hadn't any conscience, it's so
inconvenient. If I didn't care about doing right, and didn't feel
uncomfortable when doing wrong, I should get on capitally. I can't
help wishing sometimes, that Mother and Father hadn't been so
particular about such things."

Ah, Jo, instead of wishing that, thank God that 'Father and
Mother were particular', and pity from your heart those who have no
such guardians to hedge them round with principles which may seem
like prison walls to impatient youth, but which will prove sure
foundations to build character upon in womanhood.
