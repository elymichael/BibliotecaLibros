Mr. Dashwoods's editorial gravity relaxed into a smile, for Jo<br/>had forgotten her 'friend', and spoken as only an author could.<br/><br/>"People want to be amused, not preached at, you know. Morals<br/>don't sell nowadays." Which was not quite a correct statement, by<br/>the way.<br/><br/>"You think it would do with these alterations, then?"<br/><br/>"Yes, it's a new plot, and pretty well worked up—language good,<br/>and so on," was Mr. Dashwood's affable reply.<br/><br/>"What do you—that is, what compensation—" began Jo, not exactly<br/>knowing how to express herself.<br/><br/>"Oh, yes, well, we give from twenty-five to thirty for things of<br/>this sort. Pay when it comes out," returned Mr. Dashwood, as if<br/>that point had escaped him. Such trifles do escape the editorial<br/>mind, it is said.<br/><br/>"Very well, you can have it," said Jo, handing back the story<br/>with a satisfied air, for after the dollar-a-column work, even<br/>twenty-five seemed good pay.<br/><br/>"Shall I tell my friend you will take another if she has one<br/>better than this?" asked Jo, unconscious of her little slip of the<br/>tongue, and emboldened by her success.<br/><br/>"Well, we'll look at it. Can't promise to take it. Tell her to<br/>make it short and spicy, and never mind the moral. What name would<br/>your friend like to put on it?" in a careless tone.<br/><br/>"None at all, if you please, she doesn't wish her name to appear<br/>and has no nom de plume," said Jo, blushing in spite of<br/>herself.<br/><br/>"Just as she likes, of course. The tale will be out next week.<br/>Will you call for the money, or shall I send it?" asked Mr.<br/>Dashwood, who felt a natural desire to know who his new contributor<br/>might be.<br/>
