done it if the flock of draggle-tailed sparrows on the hedge had
been human beings, for she was very far gone indeed, and quite
regardless of everything but her own happiness. Though it came in
such a very simple guise, that was the crowning moment of both
their lives, when, turning from the night and storm and loneliness
to the household light and warmth and peace waiting to receive
them, with a glad "Welcome home!" Jo led her lover in, and shut the
door.
