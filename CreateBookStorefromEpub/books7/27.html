<br/>"So do I, it was so smooth and pretty. But it will soon grow out<br/>again," said Beth, coming to kiss and comfort the shorn sheep.<br/><br/>After various lesser mishaps, Meg was finished at last, and by<br/>the united exertions of the entire family Jo's hair was got up and<br/>her dress on. They looked very well in their simple suits, Meg's in<br/>silvery drab, with a blue velvet snood, lace frills, and the pearl<br/>pin. Jo in maroon, with a stiff, gentlemanly linen collar, and a<br/>white chrysanthemum or two for her only ornament. Each put on one<br/>nice light glove, and carried one soiled one, and all pronounced<br/>the effect "quite easy and fine". Meg's high-heeled slippers were<br/>very tight and hurt her, though she would not own it, and Jo's<br/>nineteen hairpins all seemed stuck straight into her head, which<br/>was not exactly comfortable, but, dear me, let us be elegant or<br/>die.<br/><br/>"Have a good time, dearies!" said Mrs. March, as the sisters<br/>went daintily down the walk. "Don't eat much supper, and come away<br/>at eleven when I send Hannah for you." As the gate clashed behind<br/>them, a voice cried from a windowâ€¦<br/><br/>"Girls, girls! Have you you both got nice pocket<br/>handkerchiefs?"<br/><br/>"Yes, yes, spandy nice, and Meg has cologne on hers," cried Jo,<br/>adding with a laugh as they went on, "I do believe Marmee would ask<br/>that if we were all running away from an earthquake."<br/><br/>"It is one of her aristocratic tastes, and quite proper, for a<br/>real lady is always known by neat boots, gloves, and handkerchief,"<br/>replied Meg, who had a good many little 'aristocratic tastes' of<br/>her own.<br/><br/>"Now don't forget to keep the bad breadth out of sight, Jo. Is<br/>my sash right? And does my hair look very bad?" said Meg, as she<br/>turned from the glass in Mrs. Gardiner's dressing room after a<br/>prolonged prink.<br/><br/>"I know I shall forget. If you see me doing anything wrong, just<br/>remind me by a wink, will you?" returned Jo, giving her collar a<br/>twitch and her head a hasty brush.<br/><br/>"No, winking isn't ladylike. I'll lift my eyebrows if any thing<br/>is wrong, and nod if you are all right. Now hold your shoulder<br/>straight, and take short steps, and don't shake hands if you are<br/>introduced to anyone. It isn't the thing."<br/><br/>"How do you learn all the proper ways? I never can. Isn't that<br/>music gay?"<br/><br/>
