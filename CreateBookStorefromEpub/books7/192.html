<br/>"I don't mind," laughed Laurie, as he settled his tie. "Why, you<br/>see I got fidgety, and so did Grandpa. We thought Hannah was<br/>overdoing the authority business, and your mother ought to know.<br/>She'd never forgive us if Bethâ€¦ Well, if anything happened, you<br/>know. So I got grandpa to say it was high time we did something,<br/>and off I pelted to the office yesterday, for the doctor looked<br/>sober, and Hannah most took my head off when I proposed a telegram.<br/>I never can bear to be 'lorded over', so that settled my mind, and<br/>I did it. Your mother will come, I know, and the late train is in<br/>at two A.M. I shall go for her, and you've only got to bottle up<br/>your rapture, and keep Beth quiet till that blessed lady gets<br/>here."<br/><br/>"Laurie, you're an angel! How shall I ever thank you?"<br/><br/>"Fly at me again. I rather liked it," said Laurie, looking<br/>mischievous, a thing he had not done for a fortnight.<br/><br/>"No, thank you. I'll do it by proxy, when your grandpa comes.<br/>Don't tease, but go home and rest, for you'll be up half the night.<br/>Bless you, Teddy, bless you!"<br/><br/>Jo had backed into a corner, and as she finished her speech, she<br/>vanished precipitately into the kitchen, where she sat down upon a<br/>dresser and told the assembled cats that she was "happy, oh, so<br/>happy!" while Laurie departed, feeling that he had made a rather<br/>neat thing of it.<br/><br/>"That's the interferingest chap I ever see, but I forgive him<br/>and do hope Mrs. March is coming right away," said Hannah, with an<br/>air of relief, when Jo told the good news.<br/><br/>Meg had a quiet rapture, and then brooded over the letter, while<br/>Jo set the sickroom in order, and Hannah "knocked up a couple of<br/>pies in case of company unexpected". A breath of fresh air seemed<br/>to blow through the house, and something better than sunshine<br/>brightened the quiet rooms. Everything appeared to feel the hopeful<br/>change. Beth's bird began to chirp again, and a half-blown rose was<br/>discovered on Amy's bush in the window. The fires seemed to burn<br/>with unusual cheeriness, and every time the girls met, their pale<br/>faces broke into smiles as they hugged one another, whispering<br/>encouragingly, "Mother's coming, dear! Mother's coming!" Every one<br/>rejoiced but Beth. She lay in that heavy stupor, alike unconscious<br/>of hope and joy, doubt and danger. It was a piteous sight, the once<br/>rosy face so changed and vacant, the once busy hands so weak and<br/>wasted, the once smiling lips quite dumb, and the once pretty,<br/>well-kept hair scattered rough and tangled on the pillow. All day<br/>she lay so, only rousing now and then to mutter, "Water!" with lips<br/>so parched they could hardly shape the word. All day Jo and Meg<br/>hovered over her, watching, waiting, hoping, and trusting in God<br/>and Mother, and all day the snow fell, the bitter wind raged, and<br/>the hours dragged slowly by. But night came at last, and every time<br/>the clock struck, the sisters, still sitting on either side of the<br/>bed, looked at each other with brightening eyes, for each hour<br/>brought help nearer. The doctor had been in to say that some<br/>change, for better or worse, would probably take place about<br/>midnight, at which time he would return.<br/><br/>Hannah, quite worn out, lay down on the sofa at the bed's foot<br/>and fell fast asleep, Mr. Laurence marched to and fro in the<br/>parlor, feeling that he would rather face a rebel battery than Mrs.<br/>March's countenance as she entered. Laurie lay on the rug,<br/>pretending to rest, but staring into the fire with the thoughtful<br/>look which made his black eyes beautifully soft and clear.<br/><br/>The girls never forgot that night, for no sleep came to them as<br/>they kept their watch, with that dreadful sense of powerlessness<br/>which comes to us in hours like those.<br/><br/>"If God spares Beth, I never will complain again," whispered Meg<br/>earnestly.<br/><br/>
