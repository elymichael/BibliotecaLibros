"No, I don't," was the blunt reply.

"Why not?" in an anxious tone.

He glanced at her frizzled head, bare shoulders, and
fantastically trimmed dress with an expression that abashed her
more than his answer, which had not a particle of his usual
politeness in it.

"I don't like fuss and feathers."

That was altogether too much from a lad younger than herself,
and Meg walked away, saying petulantly, "You are the rudest boy I
ever saw."

Feeling very much ruffled, she went and stood at a quiet window
to cool her cheeks, for the tight dress gave her an uncomfortably
brilliant color. As she stood there, Major Lincoln passed by, and a
minute after she heard him saying to his mother…

"They are making a fool of that little girl. I wanted you to see
her, but they have spoiled her entirely. She's nothing but a doll
tonight."

"Oh, dear!" sighed Meg. "I wish I'd been sensible and worn my
own things, then I should not have disgusted other people, or felt
so uncomfortable and ashamed of myself."

She leaned her forehead on the cool pane, and stood half hidden
by the curtains, never minding that her favorite waltz had begun,
till some one touched her, and turning, she saw Laurie, looking
penitent, as he said, with his very best bow and his hand out…

"Please forgive my rudeness, and come and dance with me."

"I'm afraid it will be too disagreeable to you," said Meg,
trying to look offended and failing entirely.
