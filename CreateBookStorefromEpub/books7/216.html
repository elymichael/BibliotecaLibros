"That's the fun of it," began Laurie, who had got a willful fit<br/>on him and was possessed to break out of bounds in some way.<br/><br/>"Hold your tongue!" cried Jo, covering her ears. "'Prunes and<br/>prisms' are my doom, and I may as well make up my mind to it. I<br/>came here to moralize, not to hear things that make me skip to<br/>think of."<br/><br/>"I know Meg would wet-blanket such a proposal, but I thought you<br/>had more spirit," began Laurie insinuatingly.<br/><br/>"Bad boy, be quiet!

Jo<br/>skipped up, and sitting on the top step, affected to be searching<br/>for her book, but was really wondering how best to introduce the<br/>dangerous object of her visit. Mr. Laurence seemed to suspect that<br/>something was brewing in her mind, for after taking several brisk<br/>turns about the room, he faced round on her, speaking so abruptly<br/>that Rasselas tumbled face downward on the floor.<br/>
