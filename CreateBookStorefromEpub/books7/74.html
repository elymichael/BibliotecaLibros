<br/>"You know something about it, and you'd better tell at once, or<br/>I'll make you." And Jo gave her a slight shake.<br/><br/>"Scold as much as you like, you'll never see your silly old book<br/>again," cried Amy, getting excited in her turn.<br/><br/>"Why not?"<br/><br/>"I burned it up."<br/><br/>"What! My little book I was so fond of, and worked over, and<br/>meant to finish before Father got home? Have you really burned it?"<br/>said Jo, turning very pale, while her eyes kindled and her hands<br/>clutched Amy nervously.<br/><br/>"Yes, I did! I told you I'd make you pay for being so cross<br/>yesterday, and I have, so… "<br/><br/>Amy got no farther, for Jo's hot temper mastered her, and she<br/>shook Amy till her teeth chattered in her head, crying in a passion<br/>of grief and anger…<br/><br/>"You wicked, wicked girl! I never can write it again, and I'll<br/>never forgive you as long as I live."<br/><br/>Meg flew to rescue Amy, and Beth to pacify Jo, but Jo was quite<br/>beside herself, and with a parting box on her sister's ear, she<br/>rushed out of the room up to the old sofa in the garret, and<br/>finished her fight alone.<br/><br/>The storm cleared up below, for Mrs. March came home, and,<br/>having heard the story, soon brought Amy to a sense of the wrong<br/>she had done her sister. Jo's book was the pride of her heart, and<br/>was regarded by her family as a literary sprout of great promise.<br/>It was only half a dozen little fairy tales, but Jo had worked over<br/>them patiently, putting her whole heart into her work, hoping to<br/>make something good enough to print. She had just copied them with<br/>great care, and had destroyed the old manuscript, so that Amy's<br/>bonfire had consumed the loving work of several years. It seemed a<br/>small loss to others, but to Jo it was a dreadful calamity, and she<br/>felt that it never could be made up to her. Beth mourned as for a<br/>departed kitten, and Meg refused to defend her pet. Mrs. March<br/>looked grave and grieved, and Amy felt that no one would love her<br/>till she had asked pardon for the act which she now regretted more<br/>than any of them.<br/><br/>
