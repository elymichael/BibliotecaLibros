<br/>"She caught up her knitting, which had dropped out of her hands,<br/>gave me a sharp look through her specs, and said, in her short way,<br/>'Finish the chapter, and don't be impertinent, miss'."<br/><br/>"Did she own she liked it?" asked Meg.<br/><br/>"Oh, bless you, no! But she let old Belsham rest, and when I ran<br/>back after my gloves this afternoon, there she was, so hard at the<br/>Vicar that she didn't hear me laugh as I danced a jig in the hall<br/>because of the good time coming. What a pleasant life she might<br/>have if only she chose! I don't envy her much, in spite of her<br/>money, for after all rich people have about as many worries as poor<br/>ones, I think," added Jo.<br/><br/>"That reminds me," said Meg, "that I've got something to tell.<br/>It isn't funny, like Jo's story, but I thought about it a good deal<br/>as I came home. At the Kings' today I found everybody in a flurry,<br/>and one of the children said that her oldest brother had done<br/>something dreadful, and Papa had sent him away. I heard Mrs. King<br/>crying and Mr. King talking very loud, and Grace and Ellen turned<br/>away their faces when they passed me, so I shouldn't see how red<br/>and swollen their eyes were. I didn't ask any questions, of course,<br/>but I felt so sorry for them and was rather glad I hadn't any wild<br/>brothers to do wicked things and disgrace the family."<br/><br/>"I think being disgraced in school is a great deal tryinger than<br/>anything bad boys can do," said Amy, shaking her head, as if her<br/>experience of life had been a deep one. "Susie Perkins came to<br/>school today with a lovely red carnelian ring. I wanted it<br/>dreadfully, and wished I was her with all my might. Well, she drew<br/>a picture of Mr. Davis, with a monstrous nose and a hump, and the<br/>words, 'Young ladies, my eye is upon you!' coming out of his mouth<br/>in a balloon thing. We were laughing over it when all of a sudden<br/>his eye was on us, and he ordered Susie to bring up her slate. She<br/>was parrylized with fright, but she went, and oh, what do you think<br/>he did? He took her by the ear—the ear! Just fancy how horrid!—and<br/>led her to the recitation platform, and made her stand there half<br/>an hour, holding the slate so everyone could see."<br/><br/>"Didn't the girls laugh at the picture?" asked Jo, who relished<br/>the scrape.<br/><br/>"Laugh? Not one! They sat still as mice, and Susie cried quarts,<br/>I know she did. I didn't envy her then, for I felt that millions of<br/>carnelian rings wouldn't have made me happy after that. I never,<br/>never should have got over such a agonizing mortification." And Amy<br/>went on with her work, in the proud consciousness of virtue and the<br/>successful utterance of two long words in a breath.<br/><br/>"I saw something I liked this morning, and I meant to tell it at<br/>dinner, but I forgot," said Beth, putting Jo's topsy-turvy basket<br/>in order as she talked. "When I went to get some oysters for<br/>Hannah, Mr. Laurence was in the fish shop, but he didn't see me,<br/>for I kept behind the fish barrel, and he was busy with Mr. Cutter<br/>the fishman. A poor woman came in with a pail and a mop, and asked<br/>Mr. Cutter if he would let her do some scrubbing for a bit of fish,<br/>because she hadn't any dinner for her children, and had been<br/>disappointed of a day's work. Mr. Cutter was in a hurry and said<br/>'No', rather crossly, so she was going away, looking hungry and<br/>sorry, when Mr. Laurence hooked up a big fish with the crooked end<br/>of his cane and held it out to her. She was so glad and surprised<br/>she took it right into her arms, and thanked him over and over. He<br/>told her to 'go along and cook it', and she hurried off, so happy!<br/>Wasn't it good of him? Oh, she did look so funny, hugging the big,<br/>slippery fish, and hoping Mr. Laurence's bed in heaven would be<br/>'aisy'."<br/><br/>When they had laughed at Beth's story, they asked their mother<br/>for one, and after a moments thought, she said soberly, "As I sat<br/>cutting out blue flannel jackets today at the rooms, I felt very<br/>anxious about Father, and thought how lonely and helpless we should<br/>be, if anything happened to him. It was not a wise thing to do, but<br/>I kept on worrying till an old man came in with an order for some<br/>clothes. He sat down near me, and I began to talk to him, for he<br/>looked poor and tired and anxious.<br/><br/>"'Have you sons in the army?' I asked, for the note he brought<br/>was not to me."<br/><br/>
