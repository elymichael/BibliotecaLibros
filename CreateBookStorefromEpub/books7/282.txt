"It's no use trying to argue with you," began Amy.

"Not the least, my dear," interrupted Jo, "so let us look
amiable, and drop a card here, as the Kings are evidently out, for
which I'm deeply grateful."

The family cardcase having done its duty the girls walked on,
and Jo uttered another thanksgiving on reaching the fifth house,
and being told that the young ladies were engaged.

"Now let us go home, and never mind Aunt March today. We can run
down there any time, and it's really a pity to trail through the
dust in our best bibs and tuckers, when we are tired and
cross."

"Speak for yourself, if you please. Aunt March likes to have us
pay her the compliment of coming in style, and making a formal
call. It's a little thing to do, but it gives her pleasure, and I
don't believe it will hurt your things half so much as letting
dirty dogs and clumping boys spoil them. Stoop down, and let me
take the crumbs off of your bonnet."

"What a good girl you are, Amy!" said Jo, with a repentant
glance from her own damaged costume to that of her sister, which
was fresh and spotless still. "I wish it was as easy for me to do
little things to please people as it is for you. I think of them,
but it takes too much time to do them, so I wait for a chance to
confer a great favor, and let the small ones slip, but they tell
best in the end, I fancy."

Amy smiled and was mollified at once, saying with a maternal
air, "Women should learn to be agreeable, particularly poor ones,
for they have no other way of repaying the kindnesses they receive.
If you'd remember that, and practice it, you'd be better liked than
I am, because there is more of you."

"I'm a crotchety old thing, and always shall be, but I'm willing
to own that you are right, only it's easier for me to risk my life
for a person than to be pleasant to him when I don't feel like it.
It's a great misfortune to have such strong likes and dislikes,
isn't it?"

"It's a greater not to be able to hide them. I don't mind saying
that I don't approve of Tudor any more than you do, but I'm not
called upon to tell him so. Neither are you, and there is no use in
making yourself disagreeable because he is."

"But I think girls ought to show when they disapprove of young
men, and how can they do it except by their manners? Preaching does
not do any good, as I know to my sorrow, since I've had Teddie to
manage. But there are many little ways in which I can influence him
without a word, and I say we ought to do it to others if we
can."

"Teddy is a remarkable boy, and can't be taken as a sample of
other boys," said Amy, in a tone of solemn conviction, which would
have convulsed the 'remarkable boy' if he had heard it. "If we were
belles, or women of wealth and position, we might do something,
perhaps, but for us to frown at one set of young gentlemen because
we don't approve of them, and smile upon another set because we do,
wouldn't have a particle of effect, and we should only be
considered odd and puritanical."
