6
Calls


"Come, Jo, it's time."

"For what?"

"You don't mean to say you have forgotten that you promised to
make half a dozen calls with me today?"

"I've done a good many rash and foolish things in my life, but I
don't think I ever was mad enough to say I'd make six calls in one
day, when a single one upsets me for a week."

"Yes, you did, it was a bargain between us. I was to finish the
crayon of Beth for you, and you were to go properly with me, and
return our neighbors' visits."

"If it was fair, that was in the bond, and I stand to the letter
of my bond, Shylock. There is a pile of clouds in the east, it's
not fair, and I don't go."

"Now, that's shirking. It's a lovely day, no prospect of rain,
and you pride yourself on keeping promises, so be honorable, come
and do your duty, and then be at peace for another six months."
