<br/>"Too stormy for me with my cold."<br/><br/>"I thought it was almost well."<br/><br/>"It's well enough for me to go out with Laurie, but not well<br/>enough to go to the Hummels'," said Jo, laughing, but looking a<br/>little ashamed of her inconsistency.<br/><br/>"Why don't you go yourself?" asked Meg.<br/><br/>"I have been every day, but the baby is sick, and I don't know<br/>what to do for it. Mrs. Hummel goes away to work, and Lottchen<br/>takes care of it. But it gets sicker and sicker, and I think you or<br/>Hannah ought to go."<br/><br/>Beth spoke earnestly, and Meg promised she would go<br/>tomorrow.<br/><br/>"Ask Hannah for some nice little mess, and take it round, Beth,<br/>the air will do you good," said Jo, adding apologetically, "I'd go<br/>but I want to finish my writing."<br/><br/>"My head aches and I'm tired, so I thought maybe some of you<br/>would go," said Beth.<br/><br/>"Amy will be in presently, and she will run down for us,"<br/>suggested Meg.<br/><br/>So Beth lay down on the sofa, the others returned to their work,<br/>and the Hummels were forgotten. An hour passed. Amy did not come,<br/>Meg went to her room to try on a new dress, Jo was absorbed in her<br/>story, and Hannah was sound asleep before the kitchen fire, when<br/>Beth quietly put on her hood, filled her basket with odds and ends<br/>for the poor children, and went out into the chilly air with a<br/>heavy head and a grieved look in her patient eyes. It was late when<br/>she came back, and no one saw her creep upstairs and shut herself<br/>into her mother's room. Half an hour after, Jo went to 'Mother's<br/>closet' for something, and there found little Beth sitting on the<br/>medicine chest, looking very grave, with red eyes and a camphor<br/>bottle in her hand.<br/><br/>
