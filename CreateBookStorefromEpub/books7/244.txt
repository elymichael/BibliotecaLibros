"Where is John?" asked Meg anxiously.

"Stopped to get the license for tomorrow, ma'am."

"Which side won the last match, Teddy?" inquired Jo, who
persisted in feeling an interest in manly sports despite her
nineteen years.

"Ours, of course. Wish you'd been there to see."

"How is the lovely Miss Randal?" asked Amy with a significant
smile.

"More cruel than ever. Don't you see how I'm pining away?" and
Laurie gave his broad chest a sounding slap and heaved a
melodramatic sigh.

"What's the last joke? Undo the bundle and see, Meg," said Beth,
eying the knobby parcel with curiosity.

"It's a useful thing to have in the house in case of fire or
thieves," observed Laurie, as a watchman's rattle appeared, amid
the laughter of the girls.

"Any time when John is away and you get frightened, Mrs. Meg,
just swing that out of the front window, and it will rouse the
neighborhood in a jiffy. Nice thing, isn't it?" and Laurie gave
them a sample of its powers that made them cover up their ears.

"There's gratitude for you! And speaking of gratitude reminds me
to mention that you may thank Hannah for saving your wedding cake
from destruction. I saw it going into your house as I came by, and
if she hadn't defended it manfully I'd have had a pick at it, for
it looked like a remarkably plummy one."

"I wonder if you will ever grow up, Laurie," said Meg in a
matronly tone.
