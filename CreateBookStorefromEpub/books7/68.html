That was dreadful. It would have been bad enough to go to her<br/>seat, and see the pitying faces of her friends, or the satisfied<br/>ones of her few enemies, but to face the whole school, with that<br/>shame fresh upon her, seemed impossible, and for a second she felt<br/>as if she could only drop down where she stood, and break her heart<br/>with crying. A bitter sense of wrong and the thought of Jenny Snow<br/>helped her to bear it, and, taking the ignominious place, she fixed<br/>her eyes on the stove funnel above what now seemed a sea of faces,<br/>and stood there, so motionless and white that the girls found it<br/>hard to study with that pathetic figure before them.<br/><br/>During the fifteen minutes that followed, the proud and<br/>sensitive little girl suffered a shame and pain which she never<br/>forgot. To others it might seem a ludicrous or trivial affair, but<br/>to her it was a hard experience, for during the twelve years of her<br/>life she had been governed by love alone, and a blow of that sort<br/>had never touched her before. The smart of her hand and the ache of<br/>her heart were forgotten in the sting of the thought, "I shall have<br/>to tell at home, and they will be so disappointed in me!"<br/><br/>The fifteen minutes seemed an hour, but they came to an end at<br/>last, and the word 'Recess!' had never seemed so welcome to her<br/>before.<br/><br/>"You can go, Miss March," said Mr. Davis, looking, as he felt,<br/>uncomfortable.<br/><br/>He did not soon forget the reproachful glance Amy gave him, as<br/>she went, without a word to anyone, straight into the anteroom,<br/>snatched her things, and left the place "forever," as she<br/>passionately declared to herself. She was in a sad state when she<br/>got home, and when the older girls arrived, some time later, an<br/>indignation meeting was held at once. Mrs. March did not say much<br/>but looked disturbed, and comforted her afflicted little daughter<br/>in her tenderest manner. Meg bathed the insulted hand with<br/>glycerine and tears, Beth felt that even her beloved kittens would<br/>fail as a balm for griefs like this, Jo wrathfully proposed that<br/>Mr. Davis be arrested without delay, and Hannah shook her fist at<br/>the 'villain' and pounded potatoes for dinner as if she had him<br/>under her pestle.<br/><br/>No notice was taken of Amy's flight, except by her mates, but<br/>the sharp-eyed demoiselles discovered that Mr. Davis was quite<br/>benignant in the afternoon, also unusually nervous. Just before<br/>school closed, Jo appeared, wearing a grim expression as she<br/>stalked up to the desk, and delivered a letter from her mother,<br/>then collected Amy's property, and departed, carefully scraping the<br/>mud from her boots on the door mat, as if she shook the dust of the<br/>place off her feet.<br/><br/>"Yes, you can have a vacation from school, but I want you to<br/>study a little every day with Beth," said Mrs. March that evening.<br/>"I don't approve of corporal punishment, especially for girls. I<br/>dislike Mr. Davis's manner of teaching and don't think the girls<br/>you associate with are doing you any good, so I shall ask your<br/>father's advice before I send you anywhere else."<br/><br/>"That's good! I wish all the girls would leave, and spoil his<br/>old school. It's perfectly maddening to think of those lovely<br/>limes," sighed Amy, with the air of a martyr.<br/><br/>"I am not sorry you lost them, for you broke the rules, and<br/>deserved some punishment for disobedience," was the severe reply,<br/>which rather disappointed the young lady, who expected nothing but<br/>sympathy.<br/><br/>"Do you mean you are glad I was disgraced before the whole<br/>school?" cried Amy.<br/><br/>"I should not have chosen that way of mending a fault," replied<br/>her mother, "but I'm not sure that it won't do you more good than a<br/>bolder method. You are getting to be rather conceited, my dear, and<br/>it is quite time you set about correcting it. You have a good many<br/>little gifts and virtues, but there is no need of parading them,<br/>for conceit spoils the finest genius. There is not much danger that<br/>real talent or goodness will be overlooked long, even if it is, the<br/>consciousness of possessing and using it well should satisfy one,<br/>and the great charm of all power is modesty."<br/>
