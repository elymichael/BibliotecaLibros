"I'm glad of that, Jo."<br/><br/>"Why, please?"<br/><br/>"Because, dear, I don't think you suited to one another. As<br/>friends you are very happy, and your frequent quarrels soon blow<br/>over, but I fear you would both rebel if you were mated for life.<br/>You are too much alike and too fond of freedom, not to mention hot<br/>tempers and strong wills, to get on happily together, in a relation<br/>which needs infinite patience and forbearance, as well as<br/>love."<br/><br/>"That's just the feeling I had, though I couldn't express it.<br/>I'm glad you think he is only beginning to care for me. It would<br/>trouble me sadly to make him unhappy, for I couldn't fall in love<br/>with the dear old fellow merely out of gratitude, could I?"<br/><br/>"You are sure of his feeling for you?"<br/><br/>The color deepened in Jo's cheeks as she answered, with the look<br/>of mingled pleasure, pride, and pain which young girls wear when<br/>speaking of first lovers, "I'm afraid it is so, Mother. He hasn't<br/>said anything, but he looks a great deal. I think I had better go<br/>away before it comes to anything."<br/><br/>"I agree with you, and if it can be managed you shall go."<br/><br/>Jo looked relieved, and after a pause, said, smiling, "How Mrs.<br/>Moffat would wonder at your want of management, if she knew, and<br/>how she will rejoice that Annie may still hope."<br/><br/>"Ah, Jo, mothers may differ in their management, but the hope is<br/>the same in allâ€”the desire to see their children happy. Meg is so,<br/>and I am content with her success. You I leave to enjoy your<br/>liberty till you tire of it, for only then will you find that there<br/>is something sweeter. Amy is my chief care now, but her good sense<br/>will help her. For Beth, I indulge no hopes except that she may be<br/>well. By the way, she seems brighter this last day or two. Have you<br/>spoken to her?'<br/><br/>"Yes, she owned she had a trouble, and promised to tell me<br/>by-and-by. I said no more, for I think I know it," and Jo told her<br/>little story.<br/><br/>Mrs. March shook her head, and did not take so romantic a view<br/>of the case, but looked grave, and repeated her opinion that for<br/>Laurie's sake Jo should go away for a time.<br/>
