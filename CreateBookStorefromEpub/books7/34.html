So Meg reclined, with rubbers well hidden, and Jo went<br/>blundering away to the dining room, which she found after going<br/>into a china closet, and opening the door of a room where old Mr.<br/>Gardiner was taking a little private refreshment. Making a dart at<br/>the table, she secured the coffee, which she immediately spilled,<br/>thereby making the front of her dress as bad as the back.<br/><br/>"Oh, dear, what a blunderbuss I am!" exclaimed Jo, finishing<br/>Meg's glove by scrubbing her gown with it.<br/><br/>"Can I help you?" said a friendly voice. And there was Laurie,<br/>with a full cup in one hand and a plate of ice in the other.<br/><br/>"I was trying to get something for Meg, who is very tired, and<br/>someone shook me, and here I am in a nice state," answered Jo,<br/>glancing dismally from the stained skirt to the coffee-colored<br/>glove.<br/><br/>"Too bad! I was looking for someone to give this to. May I take<br/>it to your sister?"<br/><br/>"Oh, thank you! I'll show you where she is. I don't offer to<br/>take it myself, for I should only get into another scrape if I<br/>did."<br/><br/>Jo led the way, and as if used to waiting on ladies, Laurie drew<br/>up a little table, brought a second installment of coffee and ice<br/>for Jo, and was so obliging that even particular Meg pronounced him<br/>a 'nice boy'. They had a merry time over the bonbons and mottoes,<br/>and were in the midst of a quiet game of&#160;<br/>Buzz<br/>, with<br/>two or three other young people who had strayed in, when Hannah<br/>appeared. Meg forgot her foot and rose so quickly that she was<br/>forced to catch hold of Jo, with an exclamation of pain.<br/><br/>"Hush! Don't say anything," she whispered, adding aloud, "It's<br/>nothing. I turned my foot a little, that's all," and limped<br/>upstairs to put her things on.<br/><br/>Hannah scolded, Meg cried, and Jo was at her wits' end, till she<br/>decided to take things into her own hands. Slipping out, she ran<br/>down and, finding a servant, asked if he could get her a carriage.<br/>It happened to be a hired waiter who knew nothing about the<br/>neighborhood and Jo was looking round for help when Laurie, who had<br/>heard what she said, came up and offered his grandfather's<br/>carriage, which had just come for him, he said.<br/><br/>"It's so early! You can't mean to go yet?" began Jo, looking<br/>relieved but hesitating to accept the offer.<br/>
