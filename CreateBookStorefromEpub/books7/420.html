"I'm shopping."<br/><br/>Mr. Bhaer smiled, as he glanced from the pickle factory on one<br/>side to the wholesale hide and leather concern on the other, but he<br/>only said politely, "You haf no umbrella. May I go also, and take<br/>for you the bundles?"<br/><br/>"Yes, thank you."<br/><br/>Jo's cheeks were as red as her ribbon, and she wondered what he<br/>thought of her, but she didn't care, for in a minute she found<br/>herself walking away arm in arm with her Professor, feeling as if<br/>the sun had suddenly burst out with uncommon brilliancy, that the<br/>world was all right again, and that one thoroughly happy woman was<br/>paddling through the wet that day.<br/><br/>"We thought you had gone," said Jo hastily, for she knew he was<br/>looking at her. Her bonnet wasn't big enough to hide her face, and<br/>she feared he might think the joy it betrayed unmaidenly.<br/><br/>"Did you believe that I should go with no farewell to those who<br/>haf been so heavenly kind to me?" he asked so reproachfully that<br/>she felt as if she had insulted him by the suggestion, and answered<br/>heartily…<br/><br/>"No, I didn't. I knew you were busy about your own affairs, but<br/>we rather missed you, Father and Mother especially."<br/><br/>"And you?"<br/><br/>"I'm always glad to see you, sir."<br/><br/>In her anxiety to keep her voice quite calm, Jo made it rather<br/>cool, and the frosty little monosyllable at the end seemed to chill<br/>the Professor, for his smile vanished, as he said gravely…<br/><br/>"I thank you, and come one more time before I go."<br/>
