"That's a foolish wish, unless you have spoiled your life. You
are so changed, I sometimes think—" there Amy stopped, with a
half-timid, half-wistful look, more significant than her unfinished
speech.

Laurie saw and understood the affectionate anxiety which she
hesitated to express, and looking straight into her eyes, said,
just as he used to say it to her mother, "It's all right,
ma'am."

That satisfied her and set at rest the doubts that had begun to
worry her lately. It also touched her, and she showed that it did,
by the cordial tone in which she said…

"I'm glad of that! I didn't think you'd been a very bad boy, but
I fancied you might have wasted money at that wicked Baden-Baden,
lost your heart to some charming Frenchwoman with a husband, or got
into some of the scrapes that young men seem to consider a
necessary part of a foreign tour. Don't stay out there in the sun,
come and lie on the grass here and 'let us be friendly', as Jo used
to say when we got in the sofa corner and told secrets."

Laurie obediently threw himself down on the turf, and began to
amuse himself by sticking daisies into the ribbons of Amy's hat,
that lay there.

"I'm all ready for the secrets." and he glanced up with a
decided expression of interest in his eyes.

"I've none to tell. You may begin."

"Haven't one to bless myself with. I thought perhaps you'd had
some news from home.."

"You have heard all that has come lately. Don't you hear often?
I fancied Jo would send you volumes."

"She's very busy. I'm roving about so, it's impossible to be
regular, you know. When do you begin your great work of art,
Raphaella?" he asked, changing the subject abruptly after another
pause, in which he had been wondering if Amy knew his secret and
wanted to talk about it.

"Never," she answered, with a despondent but decided air. "Rome
took all the vanity out of me, for after seeing the wonders there,
I felt too insignificant to live and gave up all my foolish hopes
in despair."
