Down they went, feeling a trifle timid, for they seldom went to<br/>parties, and informal as this little gathering was, it was an event<br/>to them. Mrs. Gardiner, a stately old lady, greeted them kindly and<br/>handed them over to the eldest of her six daughters. Meg knew<br/>Sallie and was at her ease very soon, but Jo, who didn't care much<br/>for girls or girlish gossip, stood about, with her back carefully<br/>against the wall, and felt as much out of place as a colt in a<br/>flower garden. Half a dozen jovial lads were talking about skates<br/>in another part of the room, and she longed to go and join them,<br/>for skating was one of the joys of her life. She telegraphed her<br/>wish to Meg, but the eyebrows went up so alarmingly that she dared<br/>not stir. No one came to talk to her, and one by one the group<br/>dwindled away till she was left alone. She could not roam about and<br/>amuse herself, for the burned breadth would show, so she stared at<br/>people rather forlornly till the dancing began. Meg was asked at<br/>once, and the tight slippers tripped about so briskly that none<br/>would have guessed the pain their wearer suffered smilingly. Jo saw<br/>a big red headed youth approaching her corner, and fearing he meant<br/>to engage her, she slipped into a curtained recess, intending to<br/>peep and enjoy herself in peace. Unfortunately, another bashful<br/>person had chosen the same refuge, for, as the curtain fell behind<br/>her, she found herself face to face with the 'Laurence boy'.<br/><br/>"Dear me, I didn't know anyone was here!" stammered Jo,<br/>preparing to back out as speedily as she had bounced in.<br/><br/>But the boy laughed and said pleasantly, though he looked a<br/>little startled, "Don't mind me, stay if you like."<br/><br/>"Shan't I disturb you?"<br/><br/>"Not a bit. I only came here because I don't know many people<br/>and felt rather strange at first, you know."<br/><br/>"So did I. Don't go away, please, unless you'd rather."<br/><br/>The boy sat down again and looked at his pumps, till Jo said,<br/>trying to be polite and easy, "I think I've had the pleasure of<br/>seeing you before. You live near us, don't you?"<br/><br/>"Next door." And he looked up and laughed outright, for Jo's<br/>prim manner was rather funny when he remembered how they had<br/>chatted about cricket when he brought the cat home.<br/><br/>That put Jo at her ease and she laughed too, as she said, in her<br/>heartiest way, "We did have such a good time over your nice<br/>Christmas present."<br/><br/>"Grandpa sent it."<br/><br/>"But you put it into his head, didn't you, now?"<br/>
