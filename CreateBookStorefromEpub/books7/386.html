<br/>In a minute Amy went back to her place, and while she dried her<br/>tears, Laurie gathered up the scattered papers, finding in the<br/>sight of sundry well-worn letters and suggestive sketches good<br/>omens for the future. As he sat down beside her, Amy felt shy<br/>again, and turned rosy red at the recollection of her impulsive<br/>greeting.<br/><br/>"I couldn't help it, I felt so lonely and sad, and was so very<br/>glad to see you. It was such a surprise to look up and find you,<br/>just as I was beginning to fear you wouldn't come," she said,<br/>trying in vain to speak quite naturally.<br/><br/>"I came the minute I heard. I wish I could say something to<br/>comfort you for the loss of dear little Beth, but I can only feel,<br/>and… " He could not get any further, for he too turned bashful all<br/>of a sudden, and did not quite know what to say. He longed to lay<br/>Amy's head down on his shoulder, and tell her to have a good cry,<br/>but he did not dare, so took her hand instead, and gave it a<br/>sympathetic squeeze that was better than words.<br/><br/>"You needn't say anything, this comforts me," she said softly.<br/>"Beth is well and happy, and I mustn't wish her back, but I dread<br/>the going home, much as I long to see them all. We won't talk about<br/>it now, for it makes me cry, and I want to enjoy you while you<br/>stay. You needn't go right back, need you?"<br/><br/>"Not if you want me, dear."<br/><br/>"I do, so much. Aunt and Flo are very kind, but you seem like<br/>one of the family, and it would be so comfortable to have you for a<br/>little while."<br/><br/>Amy spoke and looked so like a homesick child whose heart was<br/>full that Laurie forgot his bashfulness all at once, and gave her<br/>just what she wanted—the petting she was used to and the cheerful<br/>conversation she needed.<br/><br/>"Poor little soul, you look as if you'd grieved yourself half<br/>sick! I'm going to take care of you, so don't cry any more, but<br/>come and walk about with me, the wind is too chilly for you to sit<br/>still," he said, in the half-caressing, half-commanding way that<br/>Amy liked, as he tied on her hat, drew her arm through his, and<br/>began to pace up and down the sunny walk under the new-leaved<br/>chestnuts. He felt more at ease upon his legs, and Amy found it<br/>pleasant to have a strong arm to lean upon, a familiar face to<br/>smile at her, and a kind voice to talk delightfully for her<br/>alone.<br/><br/>The quaint old garden had sheltered many pairs of lovers, and<br/>seemed expressly made for them, so sunny and secluded was it, with<br/>nothing but the tower to overlook them, and the wide lake to carry<br/>away the echo of their words, as it rippled by below. For an hour<br/>this new pair walked and talked, or rested on the wall, enjoying<br/>the sweet influences which gave such a charm to time and place, and<br/>when an unromantic dinner bell warned them away, Amy felt as if she<br/>left her burden of loneliness and sorrow behind her in the chateau<br/>garden.<br/><br/>The moment Mrs. Carrol saw the girl's altered face, she was<br/>illuminated with a new idea, and exclaimed to herself, "Now I<br/>understand it all—the child has been pining for young Laurence.<br/>Bless my heart, I never thought of such a thing!"<br/><br/>
