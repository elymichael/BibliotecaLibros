"November is the most disagreeable month in the whole year,"
said Margaret, standing at the window one dull afternoon, looking
out at the frostbitten garden.

"That's the reason I was born in it," observed Jo pensively,
quite unconscious of the blot on her nose.

"If something very pleasant should happen now, we should think
it a delightful month," said Beth, who took a hopeful view of
everything, even November.

"I dare say, but nothing pleasant ever does happen in this
family," said Meg, who was out of sorts. "We go grubbing along day
after day, without a bit of change, and very little fun. We might
as well be in a treadmill."

"My patience, how blue we are!" cried Jo. "I don't much wonder,
poor dear, for you see other girls having splendid times, while you
grind, grind, year in and year out. Oh, don't I wish I could manage
things for you as I do for my heroines! You're pretty enough and
good enough already, so I'd have some rich relation leave you a
fortune unexpectedly. Then you'd dash out as an heiress, scorn
everyone who has slighted you, go abroad, and come home my Lady
Something in a blaze of splendor and elegance."

"People don't have fortunes left them in that style nowadays,
men have to work and women marry for money. It's a dreadfully
unjust world," said Meg bitterly.

"Jo and I are going to make fortunes for you all. Just wait ten
years, and see if we don't," said Amy, who sat in a corner making
mud pies, as Hannah called her little clay models of birds, fruit,
and faces.
