"That's a foolish wish, unless you have spoiled your life. You<br/>are so changed, I sometimes think—" there Amy stopped, with a<br/>half-timid, half-wistful look, more significant than her unfinished<br/>speech.<br/><br/>Laurie saw and understood the affectionate anxiety which she<br/>hesitated to express, and looking straight into her eyes, said,<br/>just as he used to say it to her mother, "It's all right,<br/>ma'am."<br/><br/>That satisfied her and set at rest the doubts that had begun to<br/>worry her lately. It also touched her, and she showed that it did,<br/>by the cordial tone in which she said…<br/><br/>"I'm glad of that! I didn't think you'd been a very bad boy, but<br/>I fancied you might have wasted money at that wicked Baden-Baden,<br/>lost your heart to some charming Frenchwoman with a husband, or got<br/>into some of the scrapes that young men seem to consider a<br/>necessary part of a foreign tour. Don't stay out there in the sun,<br/>come and lie on the grass here and 'let us be friendly', as Jo used<br/>to say when we got in the sofa corner and told secrets."<br/><br/>Laurie obediently threw himself down on the turf, and began to<br/>amuse himself by sticking daisies into the ribbons of Amy's hat,<br/>that lay there.<br/><br/>"I'm all ready for the secrets." and he glanced up with a<br/>decided expression of interest in his eyes.<br/><br/>"I've none to tell. You may begin."<br/><br/>"Haven't one to bless myself with. I thought perhaps you'd had<br/>some news from home.."<br/><br/>"You have heard all that has come lately. Don't you hear often?<br/>I fancied Jo would send you volumes."<br/><br/>"She's very busy. I'm roving about so, it's impossible to be<br/>regular, you know. When do you begin your great work of art,<br/>Raphaella?" he asked, changing the subject abruptly after another<br/>pause, in which he had been wondering if Amy knew his secret and<br/>wanted to talk about it.<br/><br/>"Never," she answered, with a despondent but decided air. "Rome<br/>took all the vanity out of me, for after seeing the wonders there,<br/>I felt too insignificant to live and gave up all my foolish hopes<br/>in despair."<br/>
