"Me has tea!" said Demi, preparing to join in the revel.

"No, but I'll save you some little cakies for breakfast, if
you'll go bye-bye like Daisy. Will you, lovey?"

"Iss!" and Demi shut his eyes tight, as if to catch sleep and
hurry the desired day.

Taking advantage of the propitious moment, Meg slipped away and
ran down to greet her husband with a smiling face and the little
blue bow in her hair which was his especial admiration. He saw it
at once and said with pleased surprise, "Why, little mother, how
gay we are tonight. Do you expect company?"

"Only you, dear."

"Is it a birthday, anniversary, or anything?"

"No, I'm tired of being dowdy, so I dressed up as a change. You
always make yourself nice for table, no matter how tired you are,
so why shouldn't I when I have the time?"

"I do it out of respect for you, my dear," said old-fashioned
John.

"Ditto, ditto, Mr. Brooke," laughed Meg, looking young and
pretty again, as she nodded to him over the teapot.

"Well, it's altogether delightful, and like old times. This
tastes right. I drink your health, dear." and John sipped his tea
with an air of reposeful rapture, which was of very short duration
however, for as he put down his cup, the door handle rattled
mysteriously, and a little voice was heard, saying impatientlyâ€¦

"Opy doy. Me's tummin!"
