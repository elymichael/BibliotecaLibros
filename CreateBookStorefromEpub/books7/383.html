<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>18<br/>Learning to Forget<br/><br/><br/>Amy's lecture did Laurie good, though, of course, he did not own<br/>it till long afterward. Men seldom do, for when women are the<br/>advisers, the lords of creation don't take the advice till they<br/>have persuaded themselves that it is just what they intended to do.<br/>Then they act upon it, and, if it succeeds, they give the weaker<br/>vessel half the credit of it. If it fails, they generously give her<br/>the whole. Laurie went back to his grandfather, and was so<br/>dutifully devoted for several weeks that the old gentleman declared<br/>the climate of Nice had improved him wonderfully, and he had better<br/>try it again. There was nothing the young gentleman would have<br/>liked better, but elephants could not have dragged him back after<br/>the scolding he had received. Pride forbid, and whenever the<br/>longing grew very strong, he fortified his resolution by repeating<br/>the words that had made the deepest impression—"I despise you." "Go<br/>and do something splendid that will make her love you."<br/><br/>Laurie turned the matter over in his mind so often that he soon<br/>brought himself to confess that he had been selfish and lazy, but<br/>then when a man has a great sorrow, he should be indulged in all<br/>sorts of vagaries till he has lived it down. He felt that his<br/>blighted affections were quite dead now, and though he should never<br/>cease to be a faithful mourner, there was no occasion to wear his<br/>weeds ostentatiously. Jo wouldn't love him, but he might make her<br/>respect and admire him by doing something which should prove that a<br/>girl's 'No' had not spoiled his life. He had always meant to do<br/>something, and Amy's advice was quite unnecessary. He had only been<br/>waiting till the aforesaid blighted affections were decently<br/>interred. That being done, he felt that he was ready to 'hide his<br/>stricken heart, and still toil on'.<br/><br/>As Goethe, when he had a joy or a grief, put it into a song, so<br/>Laurie resolved to embalm his love sorrow in music, and to compose<br/>a Requiem which should harrow up Jo's soul and melt the heart of<br/>every hearer. Therefore the next time the old gentleman found him<br/>getting restless and moody and ordered him off, he went to Vienna,<br/>where he had musical friends, and fell to work with the firm<br/>determination to distinguish himself. But whether the sorrow was<br/>too vast to be embodied in music, or music too ethereal to uplift a<br/>mortal woe, he soon discovered that the Requiem was beyond him just<br/>at present. It was evident that his mind was not in working order<br/>yet, and his ideas needed clarifying, for often in the middle of a<br/>plaintive strain, he would find himself humming a dancing tune that<br/>vividly recalled the Christmas ball at Nice, especially the stout<br/>Frenchman, and put an effectual stop to tragic composition for the<br/>time being.<br/><br/>Then he tried an opera, for nothing seemed impossible in the<br/>beginning, but here again unforeseen difficulties beset him. He<br/>wanted Jo for his heroine, and called upon his memory to supply him<br/>with tender recollections and romantic visions of his love. But<br/>memory turned traitor, and as if possessed by the perverse spirit<br/>of the girl, would only recall Jo's oddities, faults, and freaks,<br/>would only show her in the most unsentimental aspects—beating mats<br/>with her head tied up in a bandanna, barricading herself with the<br/>sofa pillow, or throwing cold water over his passion a la<br/>Gummidge—and an irresistable laugh spoiled the pensive picture he<br/>was endeavoring to paint. Jo wouldn't be put into the opera at any<br/>price, and he had to give her up with a "Bless that girl, what a<br/>torment she is!" and a clutch at his hair, as became a distracted<br/>composer.<br/><br/>When he looked about him for another and a less intractable<br/>damsel to immortalize in melody, memory produced one with the most<br/>obliging readiness. This phantom wore many faces, but it always had<br/>golden hair, was enveloped in a diaphanous cloud, and floated<br/>airily before his mind's eye in a pleasing chaos of roses,<br/>peacocks, white ponies, and blue ribbons. He did not give the<br/>complacent wraith any name, but he took her for his heroine and<br/>grew quite fond of her, as well he might, for he gifted her with<br/>every gift and grace under the sun, and escorted her, unscathed,<br/>through trials which would have annihilated any mortal woman.<br/><br/>Thanks to this inspiration, he got on swimmingly for a time, but<br/>gradually the work lost its charm, and he forgot to compose, while<br/>he sat musing, pen in hand, or roamed about the gay city to get<br/>some new ideas and refresh his mind, which seemed to be in a<br/>somewhat unsettled state that winter. He did not do much, but he<br/>thought a great deal and was conscious of a change of some sort<br/>going on in spite of himself. "It's genius simmering, perhaps. I'll<br/>let it simmer, and see what comes of it," he said, with a secret<br/>suspicion all the while that it wasn't genius, but something far<br/>more common. Whatever it was, it simmered to some purpose, for he<br/>grew more and more discontented with his desultory life, began to<br/>long for some real and earnest work to go at, soul and body, and<br/>finally came to the wise conclusion that everyone who loved music<br/>was not a composer. Returning from one of Mozart's grand operas,<br/>splendidly performed at the Royal Theatre, he looked over his own,<br/>played a few of the best parts, sat staring at the busts of<br/>Mendelssohn, Beethoven, and Bach, who stared benignly back again.<br/>Then suddenly he tore up his music sheets, one by one, and as the<br/>last fluttered out of his hand, he said soberly to himself…<br/><br/>"She is right! Talent isn't genius, and you can't make it so.<br/>That music has taken the vanity out of me as Rome took it out of<br/>her, and I won't be a humbug any longer. Now what shall I do?"<br/>
