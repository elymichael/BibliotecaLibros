<br/>"You read it! I can't, I feel so queer! Oh, it is too lovely!"<br/>and Beth hid her face in Jo's apron, quite upset by her<br/>present.<br/><br/>Jo opened the paper and began to laugh, for the first words she<br/>saw were…<br/><br/>"Miss March: "Dear Madam—"<br/><br/>"How nice it sounds! I wish someone would write to me so!" said<br/>Amy, who thought the old-fashioned address very elegant.<br/><br/>"'I have had many pairs of slippers in my life, but I never had<br/>any that suited me so well as yours,'" continues Jo. "'Heartsease<br/>is my favorite flower, and these will always remind me of the<br/>gentle giver. I like to pay my debts, so I know you will allow 'the<br/>old gentleman' to send you something which once belonged to the<br/>little grand daughter he lost. With hearty thanks and best wishes,<br/>I remain "'Your grateful friend and humble servant, 'JAMES<br/>LAURENCE'."<br/><br/>"There, Beth, that's an honor to be proud of, I'm sure! Laurie<br/>told me how fond Mr. Laurence used to be of the child who died, and<br/>how he kept all her little things carefully. Just think, he's given<br/>you her piano. That comes of having big blue eyes and loving<br/>music," said Jo, trying to soothe Beth, who trembled and looked<br/>more excited than she had ever been before.<br/><br/>"See the cunning brackets to hold candles, and the nice green<br/>silk, puckered up, with a gold rose in the middle, and the pretty<br/>rack and stool, all complete," added Meg, opening the instrument<br/>and displaying its beauties.<br/><br/>"'Your humble servant, James Laurence'. Only think of his<br/>writing that to you. I'll tell the girls. They'll think it's<br/>splendid," said Amy, much impressed by the note.<br/><br/>"Try it, honey. Let's hear the sound of the baby pianny," said<br/>Hannah, who always took a share in the family joys and sorrows.<br/><br/>So Beth tried it, and everyone pronounced it the most remarkable<br/>piano ever heard. It had evidently been newly tuned and put in<br/>apple-pie order, but, perfect as it was, I think the real charm lay<br/>in the happiest of all happy faces which leaned over it, as Beth<br/>lovingly touched the beautiful black and white keys and pressed the<br/>bright pedals.<br/><br/>
