"That is a grand pianoforte, and he might think it too large for
Mrs. Bates's house."

"You may say what you chuse—but your countenance testifies that
your thoughts on this subject are very much like mine."

"I do not know. I rather believe you are giving me more credit
for acuteness than I deserve. I smile because you smile, and shall
probably suspect whatever I find you suspect; but at present I do
not see what there is to question. If Colonel Campbell is not the
person, who can be?"
