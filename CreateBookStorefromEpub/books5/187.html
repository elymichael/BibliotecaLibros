<br/>"I know you, I know you; you would take up with any thing; but I<br/>shall be a little more nice, and I am sure the good Campbells will<br/>be quite on my side; with your superior talents, you have a right<br/>to move in the first circle. Your musical knowledge alone would<br/>entitle you to name your own terms, have as many rooms as you like,<br/>and mix in the family as much as you chose;—that is—I do not know—<br/>if you knew the harp, you might do all that, I am very sure; but<br/>you sing as well as play;—yes, I really believe you might, even<br/>without the harp, stipulate for what you chose;—and you must and<br/>shall be delightfully, honourably and comfortably settled before<br/>the Campbells or I have any rest."<br/><br/>"You may well class the delight, the honour, and the comfort of<br/>such a situation together," said Jane, "they are pretty sure to be<br/>equal; however, I am very serious in not wishing any thing to be<br/>attempted at present for me. I am exceedingly obliged to you, Mrs.<br/>Elton, I am obliged to any body who feels for me, but I am quite<br/>serious in wishing nothing to be done till the summer. For two or<br/>three months longer I shall remain where I am, and as I am."<br/><br/>"And I am quite serious too, I assure you," replied Mrs. Elton<br/>gaily, "in resolving to be always on the watch, and employing my<br/>friends to watch also, that nothing really unexceptionable may pass<br/>us."<br/><br/>In this style she ran on; never thoroughly stopped by any thing<br/>till Mr. Woodhouse came into the room; her vanity had then a change<br/>of object, and Emma heard her saying in the same half-whisper to<br/>Jane,<br/><br/>"Here comes this dear old beau of mine, I protest!—Only think of<br/>his gallantry in coming away before the other men!—what a dear<br/>creature he is;—I assure you I like him excessively. I admire all<br/>that quaint, old-fashioned politeness; it is much more to my taste<br/>than modern ease; modern ease often disgusts me. But this good old<br/>Mr. Woodhouse, I wish you had heard his gallant speeches to me at<br/>dinner. Oh! I assure you I began to think my caro sposo would be<br/>absolutely jealous. I fancy I am rather a favourite; he took notice<br/>of my gown. How do you like it?—Selina's choice—handsome, I think,<br/>but I do not know whether it is not over-trimmed; I have the<br/>greatest dislike to the idea of being over-trimmed—quite a horror<br/>of finery. I must put on a few ornaments now, because it is<br/>expected of me. A bride, you know, must appear like a bride, but my<br/>natural taste is all for simplicity; a simple style of dress is so<br/>infinitely preferable to finery. But I am quite in the minority, I<br/>believe; few people seem to value simplicity of dress,—show and<br/>finery are every thing. I have some notion of putting such a<br/>trimming as this to my white and silver poplin. Do you think it<br/>will look well?"<br/><br/>The whole party were but just reassembled in the drawing-room<br/>when Mr. Weston made his appearance among them. He had returned to<br/>a late dinner, and walked to Hartfield as soon as it was over. He<br/>had been too much expected by the best judges, for surprize— but<br/>there was great joy. Mr. Woodhouse was almost as glad to see him<br/>now, as he would have been sorry to see him before. John Knightley<br/>only was in mute astonishment.—That a man who might have spent his<br/>evening quietly at home after a day of business in London, should<br/>set off again, and walk half a mile to another man's house, for the<br/>sake of being in mixed company till bed-time, of finishing his day<br/>in the efforts of civility and the noise of numbers, was a<br/>circumstance to strike him deeply. A man who had been in motion<br/>since eight o'clock in the morning, and might now have been still,<br/>who had been long talking, and might have been silent, who had been<br/>in more than one crowd, and might have been alone!—Such a man, to<br/>quit the tranquillity and independence of his own fireside, and on<br/>the evening of a cold sleety April day rush out again into the<br/>world!—Could he by a touch of his finger have instantly taken back<br/>his wife, there would have been a motive; but his coming would<br/>probably prolong rather than break up the party. John Knightley<br/>looked at him with amazement, then shrugged his shoulders, and<br/>said, "I could not have believed it even of him."<br/><br/>Mr. Weston meanwhile, perfectly unsuspicious of the indignation<br/>he was exciting, happy and cheerful as usual, and with all the<br/>right of being principal talker, which a day spent anywhere from<br/>home confers, was making himself agreeable among the rest; and<br/>having satisfied the inquiries of his wife as to his dinner,<br/>convincing her that none of all her careful directions to the<br/>servants had been forgotten, and spread abroad what public news he<br/>had heard, was proceeding to a family communication, which, though<br/>principally addressed to Mrs. Weston, he had not the smallest doubt<br/>of being highly interesting to every body in the room. He gave her<br/>a letter, it was from Frank, and to herself; he had met with it in<br/>his way, and had taken the liberty of opening it.<br/><br/>"Read it, read it," said he, "it will give you pleasure; only a<br/>few lines—will not take you long; read it to Emma."<br/><br/>The two ladies looked over it together; and he sat smiling and<br/>talking to them the whole time, in a voice a little subdued, but<br/>very audible to every body.<br/><br/>"Well, he is coming, you see; good news, I think. Well, what do<br/>you say to it?—I always told you he would be here again soon, did<br/>not I?—Anne, my dear, did not I always tell you so, and you would<br/>not believe me?—In town next week, you see—at the latest, I dare<br/>say; for she is as impatient as the black gentleman when any thing<br/>is to be done; most likely they will be there to-morrow or<br/>Saturday. As to her illness, all nothing of course. But it is an<br/>excellent thing to have Frank among us again, so near as town. They<br/>will stay a good while when they do come, and he will be half his<br/>time with us. This is precisely what I wanted. Well, pretty good<br/>news, is not it? Have you finished it? Has Emma read it all? Put it<br/>up, put it up; we will have a good talk about it some other time,<br/>but it will not do now. I shall only just mention the circumstance<br/>to the others in a common way."<br/><br/>
