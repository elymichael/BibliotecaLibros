<br/><br/><br/>Chapter<br/><br/>17<br/><br/>&#160;<br/><br/><br/>When the ladies returned to the drawing-room after dinner, Emma<br/>found it hardly possible to prevent their making two distinct<br/>parties;— with so much perseverance in judging and behaving ill did<br/>Mrs. Elton engross Jane Fairfax and slight herself. She and Mrs.<br/>Weston were obliged to be almost always either talking together or<br/>silent together. Mrs. Elton left them no choice. If Jane repressed<br/>her for a little time, she soon began again; and though much that<br/>passed between them was in a half-whisper, especially on Mrs.<br/>Elton's side, there was no avoiding a knowledge of their principal<br/>subjects: The post-office—catching cold—fetching letters—and<br/>friendship, were long under discussion; and to them succeeded one,<br/>which must be at least equally unpleasant to Jane—inquiries whether<br/>she had yet heard of any situation likely to suit her, and<br/>professions of Mrs. Elton's meditated activity.<br/><br/>"Here is April come!" said she, "I get quite anxious about you.<br/>June will soon be here."<br/><br/>"But I have never fixed on June or any other month—merely looked<br/>forward to the summer in general."<br/><br/>"But have you really heard of nothing?"<br/><br/>"I have not even made any inquiry; I do not wish to make any<br/>yet."<br/><br/>"Oh! my dear, we cannot begin too early; you are not aware of<br/>the difficulty of procuring exactly the desirable thing."<br/><br/>
